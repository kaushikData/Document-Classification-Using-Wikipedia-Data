The '''AeroVironment Nano Hummingbird''' or '''Nano Air Vehicle''' (NAV) is a tiny, [[remote control]]led aircraft built to resemble and [[Ornithopter|fly like]] a [[hummingbird]], developed in the [[United States]] by [[AeroVironment|AeroVironment, Inc.]] to specifications provided by the [[DARPA|Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA). The Hummingbird is equipped with a small video camera for surveillance and reconnaissance purposes and, for now, operates in the air for up to 11 minutes. It can fly outdoors, or enter a doorway to investigate indoor environments. It was announced to the public on 17 February 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/and-finally/artificial-hummingbird-developed-2546540.html Artificial hummingbird developed] ''Irish Independent''. 2011-02-18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avinc.com/nano Nano Hummingbird]. AeroVironment, Inc. 2011-02-16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="release"&gt;[http://www.avinc.com/resources/press_release/aerovironment_develops_worlds_first_fully_operational_life-size_hummingbird AeroVironment Develops World’s First Fully Operational Life-Size Hummingbird-Like Unmanned Aircraft for DARPA]. AeroVironment, Inc. 2011-02-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specifications==
DARPA contributed $4 million to AeroVironment since 2006&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2011/feb/17/business/la-fi-hummingbird-drone-20110217 It's a bird! It's a spy! It's both] ''Los Angeles Times'', 2011-02-17.&lt;/ref&gt; to create a prototype "hummingbird-like" aircraft for the Nano Air Vehicle (NAV) program.&lt;ref name="darpa"&gt;[http://www.darpa.mil/Our_Work/DSO/Programs/Nano_Air_Vehicle_%28NAV%29.aspx Nano Air Vehicle] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130220154307/http://www.darpa.mil/Our_Work/DSO/Programs/Nano_Air_Vehicle_%28NAV%29.aspx |date=February 20, 2013 }} ''Defense Sciences Office, DARPA''. Retrieved: 2011-02-20.&lt;/ref&gt; The result was called the ''Nano Hummingbird'' which can fly at {{convert|11|mph}} and move in [[Aircraft principal axes|three axes of motion]]. The aircraft can climb and descend vertically; fly sideways left and right; forward and backward; rotate clockwise and counter-clockwise; and hover in mid-air. The artificial hummingbird maneuver using its flapping wings for propulsion and [[Flight dynamics (aircraft)|attitude control]]. It has a body shaped like a real hummingbird, a wingspan of {{convert|6.3|in}}, and a total flying weight of {{convert|0.67|oz}}—less than an [[AA battery]]. This includes the systems required for flight: batteries, motors, and communications systems; as well as the video camera payload.

==Technical goals==
DARPA established flight test milestones for the Hummingbird to achieve and the finished prototype met all of them, and even exceeded some of these objectives:&lt;ref name="release" /&gt;
{{cquote|
* Demonstrate precision hover flight within a virtual two-meter diameter sphere for one minute.
* Demonstrate hover stability in a wind gust flight which required the aircraft to hover and tolerate a two-meter per second (five miles per hour) wind gust from the side, without drifting downwind more than one meter.
* Demonstrate a continuous hover endurance of eight minutes with no external power source.
* Fly and demonstrate controlled, transition flight from hover to 11 miles per hour fast forward flight and back to hover flight.
* Demonstrate flying from outdoors to indoors, and back outdoors through a normal-size doorway.
* Demonstrate flying indoors "heads-down" where the pilot operates the aircraft only looking at the live video image stream from the aircraft, without looking at or hearing the aircraft directly.
* Fly the aircraft in hover and fast forward flight with bird-shaped body and bird-shaped wings.
}}
The device is bigger and heavier than a typical real hummingbird, but is smaller and lighter than the largest hummingbird varieties. It could be deployed to perform reconnaissance and surveillance in urban environments or on battlefields, and might perch on windowsills or power lines, or enter buildings to observe its surroundings, relaying camera views back to its operator.&lt;ref name="latimes" /&gt; According to DARPA,
the Nano Air Vehicle's configuration will "provide the warfighter with unprecedented capability for urban mission operations."&lt;ref name="darpa" /&gt;

[[File:Childe Hassam - Allies Day.jpg|thumb|Allies Day, May 1917, [[National Gallery of Art]]]]
[[File:Allies at the Brandenburg Gate, 1945.jpg|thumb|[[Field Marshal]] [[Bernard Montgomery]] decorates [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] Marshals and [[general]]s at the [[Brandenburg Gate]] in [[Berlin]], 12 July 1945.]]
An '''alliance''' is a relationship among [[people]], groups, or [[sovereign state|states]] that have joined together for mutual benefit or to achieve some common purpose, whether or not explicit agreement has been worked out among them.&lt;ref name='Definition of "Alliance"'&gt;{{cite web|title=Define Alliance|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/alliance|website=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of an alliance are called '''allies'''. Alliances form in many settings, including [[political alliance]]s, [[military alliance]]s, and [[business alliance]]s. When the term is used in the context of [[war]] or armed struggle, such associations may also be called '''allied powers''', especially when discussing [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]] or [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]].

A formal [[military alliance]] is not required for being perceived as an ally—[[co-belligerence]], fighting alongside someone, is enough. According to this usage, allies become so not when concluding an alliance treaty but when struck by war.

When spelled with a capital "A", "Allies" usually denotes the countries who fought together against the [[Central Powers]] in World War&amp;nbsp;I (the [[Allies of World War&amp;nbsp;I]]), or those who fought against the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis Powers]] in World War&amp;nbsp;II (the [[Allies of World War&amp;nbsp;II]]). The term has also been used by the [[United States Army]] to describe the countries that gave assistance to [[South Vietnam]] during the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Larsen |first1=Stanley|authorlink=|last2=Collins|first2=James |title=Allied Participation in Vietnam |url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/Vietnam/allied/ |accessdate=January 15, 2013|series=Vietnam Studies |year=1975 |publisher=Department of the Army |location=Washington, D.C. |oclc=1119579|page= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, the term "Allied forces" has also been used to describe the [[coalition of the Gulf War]], as opposed to forces the [[Multi-National Force – Iraq|Multi-National Forces in Iraq]] which are commonly referred to as "Coalition forces" or, as by the [[George W. Bush]] administration, [[Coalition of the willing|"the coalition of the willing"]].

The Allied Powers in World War&amp;nbsp;I (also known as the [[Triple Entente|Entente Powers]]) were initially the [[British Empire|United Kingdom]], [[French Third Republic|France]], the [[Russian Empire]], [[Kingdom of Belgium|Belgium]], [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]], [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]] and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], joined later by [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], [[Portugal]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], the [[United States]], [[Kingdom of Greece (Glücksburg)|Greece]] and [[Brazil]]. Some, such as the Russian Empire, withdrew from the war before the armistice due to revolution or defeat.

== Effects ==
Scholars are divided as to the impact of alliances. Several studies find that defensive alliances deter conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fang|first=Songying|last2=Johnson|first2=Jesse C.|last3=Leeds|first3=Brett Ashley|date=2014-10-01|title=To Concede or to Resist?

==International opinion==
[[File:BlankMap-World-large-limited-recognition (1).png|thumb|Map indicating international preferences for principle ally in the case a country were attacked, as of 2017.]]
According to a 2017 poll by [[WIN/GIA]], the United States was the most preferred ally internationally. [[Russia]] and [[China]], who preferred one another, both trailed America globally. Four countries, [[Bulgaria]], [[Greece]], [[Slovenia]] and [[Turkey]], preferred Russia, despite being members of [[NATO]].&lt;ref name="bloomberg"/&gt;

In [[Pakistan]], 72% of respondents preferred ties to China, the largest margin of any country surveyed, while 46% of [[Bangladesh]] preferred [[India]]. A total of 22 countries indicated a preference for the United Kingdom at a rate of 10% or more, but the United States was the only country to prefer the Britain over any other, at a rate of 43%. Five counties preferred France at a rate of 10% or more, led by [[Belgium]] at a rate of 25%. A single country, [[Iraq]] expressed no preference, while three other countries, [[Lebanon]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], and [[Slovenia]], expressed no preference at a rate of 11% or more, although at a smaller rate than their preference for Russia on the part of Lebanon and Slovenia, and China on the part of Palestine. [[Kosovo]] reported the most unified opinion, preferring the United States at a rate of 92%, while Russia's most unified supporters were [[Mongolia]] (71%), [[Armenia]] (67%) and [[Serbia]] (56%). In total, 21 countries expressed a preference for America at a rate of 50% or more.&lt;ref name="bloomberg"/&gt;

'''Aratius''' ({{lang-el|'Αράτιος}}, d. 552) was an [[Armenians|Armenian]] military commander of the 6th century whose brother was [[Nerses II of Armenia|Nerses]]. He served at first the [[Sasanian Empire]], then defected to the [[Byzantine Empire]]. He is primarily known for his activities in the [[Iberian War]] and the [[Gothic War (535–554)|Gothic War]]. He was eventually killed in an ambush. Primary sources about him include [[Choricius of Gaza]] and [[Procopius of Caesarea]].&lt;ref name="PLRE"&gt;Martindale (1992), p. 102-104&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Aratius was a native of [[Persian Armenia]]. He was a brother of Isaacius (Isaac) and Narses. His brother should not be confused with the famous general [[Narses]]. [[Choricius of Gaza]] describes Aratius as originating from a good family and having distinguished brothers. He does not identify this family. Modern historians suggest that they could be part of the [[Kamsarakan]] family, also ancestral to Narses.&lt;ref name="PLRE"/&gt;

===Iberian War===
Aratius and Narses are first mentioned in 527. They were fighting for the [[Sassanid Empire]] in the [[Iberian War]] (526-532). The two of them managed to win a victory over the Byzantine commanders [[Belisarius]] and [[Sittas]]. The battle is briefly described by [[Procopius]]: "And the Romans, under the leadership of Sittas and Belisarius, made an inroad into [[Nor-Shirakan|Persarmenia]], a territory subject to the Persians, where they plundered a large tract of country and then withdrew with a great multitude of Armenian captives. These two men were both youths and wearing their first beards, body-guards of the general [[Justinian I|Justinian]], who later shared the empire with his uncle [[Justin I]]. But when a second inroad had been made by the Romans into Armenia, Narses and Aratius unexpectedly confronted them and engaged them in battle. These men not long after this came to the Romans as deserters, and made the expedition to Italy with Belisarius; but on the present occasion they joined battle with the forces of Sittas and Belisarius and gained the advantage over them."&lt;ref name="PLRE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Persian"&gt;Dewing (1914), History of the Wars, Book 1, Chapter 12&lt;/ref&gt;

In summer 530, Aratius and his brothers Narses deserted to the Byzantine Empire. They transported their mother with them. They were welcomed and rewarded by the eunuch Narses, a fellow Persarmenian. At the time this Narses was not yet a general, but a ''[[Sakellarios|sacellarius]]''. They were soon joined by Isaacius. Procopius narrates: "Narses and Aratius who at the beginning of this war, as I have stated above, had an encounter with Sittas and Belisarius in the land of the Persarmenians, came together with their mother as deserters to the Romans; and the emperor's steward, Narses, received them (for he too happened to be a Persarmenian by birth), and he presented them with a large sum of money. When this came to the knowledge of Isaac, their youngest brother, he secretly opened negotiations with the Romans, and delivered over to them the fortress of Bolum, which lies very near the limits of [[Erzurum|Theodosiopolis]]. For he directed that soldiers should be concealed somewhere in the vicinity, and he received them into the fort by night, opening stealthily one small gate for them. Thus he too came to Byzantium."&lt;ref name="PLRE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Persian2"&gt;Dewing (1914), History of the Wars, Book 1, Chapter 15&lt;/ref&gt;

===Palestine===
Aratius resurfaces in 535/536, as ''[[Dux]] [[Palestine (region)|Palestinae]]'', when Choricius composed a [[panegyric]] for both Aratius and the ''[[archon]]'' Stephen, the governor of Palestina. On 1 July 536, Stephanus was promoted to [[proconsul]] of Palaestina Prima (First Palestine). The panegyric was composed shortly before this promotion. The text includes mentions of Aratius' activities in the intervening years.&lt;ref name="PLRE"/&gt;

He is first credited with ending a revolt of religious dissenters in the vicinity of [[Caesarea]]. He was then supposedly able to do so without resorting to force. He is then credited as the ''[[strategos]]'' (general) responsible for capturing an enemy fortress, which was considered impregnable. Who were the enemy [[barbarian]]s is left unclear, though they could have been hostile [[Arab people|Arabs]]. He is thirdly mentioned leading a force of about 20 men in opening a pass which was held closed by Arab attacks. Again supposedly without a battle. He is next mentioning restoring Byzantine control over Iotabe ([[Tiran Island]]), previously occupied by neighbouring tribesmen. Aratius was finally able to locate the stronghold of these tribesmen on the mainland, attack it and capture it. He is particularly praised for the revenue brought in by Iotabe, through the [[customs]] paid there.&lt;ref name="PLRE"/&gt;

Choricius' flattering description features Aratius as an able man, merciful in administering justice and honest in financial matters.&lt;ref name="PLRE"/&gt;

===Gothic War===
Procopius next mentions Aratius in 538. He was sent to the [[Gothic War (535–554)|Gothic War]] in the [[Italian Peninsula]], leading a group of reinforcements for Belisarius. His title at the time is not recorded. He might have been a ''[[magister militum]]'' or a ''[[comes rei militaris]]''. He probably arrived in the spring or summer of the year. He was reportedly ordered by Belisarius to set his camp near [[Osimo|Auximum]] with 1,000 men. The town was a stronghold of the Ostrogoths and Aratius' mission was to keep watch over their activities.&lt;ref name="PLRE"/&gt;

Aratius spent the winter of 538-539 at [[Fermo|Firmum]], continuing his watch over nearby Auximum. He took part in the siege of Auximum in 539. He and his brother Narses were leading a force of Armenians during said siege. In 540, Aratius, his brother Narses, [[Bessas (general)|Bessas]], and [[John (nephew of Vitalian)|John]] fell out of favour with Belisarius and sent away from [[Ravenna]]. Belisarius and the eunuch Narses rivaled each other at the time. Belisarius, who chose Ravenna for his seat, suspected them of serving his rival. Belisarius was soon recalled from Italy. Aratius presumably continued fighting the Gothic War, but his activities over the following decade are mostly unrecorded.&lt;ref name="PLRE"/&gt;

===Later years===
His next prominent action was in 549. Aratius, [[Bouzes]], Constantianus and John were tasked with leading a force of 10,000 cavalryman on a mission. They were to assist the [[Lombards]] in their conflict with the Gepids. This campaign was short-lived as the two opponents concluded a peace treaty, making the presence of Byzantine forces unnecessary.&lt;ref name="PLRE"/&gt;

In early 551, Aratius was one of the military commanders sent to face the [[South Slavs]] who were plundering the [[Balkans]]. Scholasticus was the overall leader of the campaign. The Byzantine forces suffered a major defeat in the vicinity of [[Edirne|Adrianople]]. But later regrouped and won a victory. Their opponents departed the area. Later that year, Aratius is again mentioned as strategos. The Cutrigur [[Huns]] had invaded Byzantine territories, acting as agents of the Gepids. Justinian I sent Aratius to negotiate their retreat. The Byzantines informed them that the Cutrigur homeland had in turn been invaded by the [[Utigurs]].&lt;ref name="PLRE"/&gt;

In 552, Aratius, [[Amalafrid]], [[Justin (consul 540)|Justin]], [[Justinian (general)|Justinian]] and [[Suartuas]] were sent on a new mission to the Lombards. They were to assist them against the Gepids. Amalafridas continued on the mission. But the rest were soon recalled by the emperor. Religious strife had broken out in [[Ulpiana]] and they were needed to restore order.&lt;ref name="PLRE"/&gt;

The Gothic War was still ongoing. In 552, [[Ildigisal]] and [[Goar (goths)|Goar]] invaded the [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum]]. Aratius, [[Arimuth]], [[Leonianus]] and [[Rhecithangus]] were tasked with stopping them. All four commanders were ambushed while drinking at a river. They were easily killed.&lt;ref name="PLRE"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6263">The '''Australasian Hydrographic Society''' ('''AHS''') is a professional hydrographic organisation covering Australasia, the South West Pacific and South East Asia. It brings together practitioners and representatives of industry in the region, particularly those involved in maritime and port services, undersea exploration, offshore oil and gas projects and associated infrastructure. Because these sectors are closely linked to rapid growth in economic development and trade in the region, it is expected [[hydrography]] will have an increasingly important role in the future development of the economy.

==History==
The Australasian Hydrographic Society was originally part of The Hydrographic Society (THS), founded in 1972. It was one of five autonomous national branches, [[Australasia]], the [[Benelux]] countries, Denmark, the UK and the USA. By 2000 it apparent that this structure was no longer workable and a decision was made to form national bodies, which would constitute a new international organisation, the International Federation of Hydrographic Societies (IFHS)]. Subsequently the Australasian Hydrographic Society was incorporated on 5 August 2002 and is now a registered a not-for-profit Public Company with the [[Australian Securities and Investments Commission]].

==Role of hydrography and related sciences in the region==
Hydrography is essential for many economic, recreational and tourism activities. In particular the development of offshore projects in the oil and gas industries, particularly off the north west coast of [[Western Australia]] and coal export facilities in [[Queensland]] have required a considerable increase in the provision of accurate and up to date hydrographic information. The attendant increase in trade, for example, has made improved navigation through sensitive area, such as the [[Great Barrier Reef]] critical. Hydrography also plays an important role in national security, border protection and humanitarian support. 

The Australasian Hydrographic Society endeavours to represent all interests in these domains.  The Australasian Hydrographic Society consequently "aims to serve anyone with an interest in the science (and art)" of hydrography, "the influence of which makes it the great common denominator for maritime nations".&lt;ref&gt;Alec Millett, President of the Australasian Hydrographic Society, Address to Hydro 2011 conference&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==

The Australasian Hydrographic Society has four regions, the East Australia Region, the West Australia Region, the New Zealand Region,  AOTM [Australia on the Map]] Division and a South West Pacific Region. Each region is geographically based, except for the [[Australia on the Map]] Division which has a transnational focus on hydrographic history and heritage.

The Australasian Hydrographic Society has a Council made up of elected officer-bearers (President, Secretary, Treasurer) and representatives from each of the regions. The Council is responsible for the governance of the organisation.

The Patron of the Australasian Hydrographic Society is Vice Admiral [[Chris Ritchie]] AO RANR. The Australasian Hydrographic Society is a member of the International Federation of Hydrographic Societies.

==Activities==

The Australasian Hydrographic Society regions engage in a wide range of activities. These include technical meetings, seminars, symposia, preparation of reports, social gatherings, educational initiatives and awareness-raising. The Society is also actively engaged in the development of international standards and protocols in hydrography, hydrographic surveying and technical specifications.

The Australasian Hydrographic Society has an online presence through its website. The New Zealand Region and [[Australia on the Map]] Division also maintain separate websites.

The New Zealand Region previously issued a newsletter, ''The Boustrophedon'', and the [[Australia on the Map]] Division currently produces an electronic newsletter, ''Map Matters''.

Divisions may from time to time produce specialist publications. The [[Australia on the Map]] Division, for example, recently published the proceedings of a symposium, ''The Freycinet Map of 1811''.&lt;ref&gt;Gerritsen, King and Eliason 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydro conferences===

The Australasian Hydrographic Society actively participates in the International Federation of Hydrographic Societies and has hosted that organisation's annual international conference on three occasions, Hydro 2003 ([[Christchurch]], New Zealand), Hydro 2007&lt;ref&gt;Hornsby and Maschke 2008&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Cairns]], Australia) and Hydro 2011 ([[Fremantle]], Australia).

==Awards==

The Australasian Hydrographic Society provides an annual Education Award for students studying in a range of hydrographic and hydrography related disciplines.

The Australasian Hydrographic Society Awards, awarded annually, recognises the merit, contribution and achievement made by individuals, groups and corporate bodies in a range of categories.

The '''Christian Peoples Alliance, CPA''' is a [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] [[political party]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. The party was founded in its present form in 1999, having grown out of a cross-party [[advocacy group]] called the '''Movement for Christian Democracy'''. The first leader of the party was Ram Gidoomal. [[Alan Craig]] took over from him in 2004 and resigned in 2012. He was replaced by Sidney Cordle who is the current leader.

==History==

===Early years===
The roots of the party can be traced back to a movement founded in 1991 by Christians — both Protestants and Catholics — known as the Movement for Christian Democracy (MCD).&lt;ref name="freston" /&gt; It was founded in Westminster at a rally which drew an attendance of 2,000 people, with the motivation of providing an answer to increasing [[secularism]]. The three founding members were [[David Alton]], [[Derek Enright]] and [[Ken Hargreaves]], who were [[Members of Parliament]] representing the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]], [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] and [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] parties respectively. While the tradition of [[Christian democracy]] parties was well established in many other parts of Europe, it was not introduced into Britain until the MCD movement of the 1990s.{{refn|There had been some earlier movements in the United Kingdom which claimed to represent Christian values, for example the [[Protestant Unionist Party]] in [[Northern Ireland]]. However, academics differentiate between the two kinds&lt;ref name="freston"&gt;Freston, ''Protestant Political Parties'', 52&lt;/ref&gt; in that the PUP was associated with regional identity and an exclusively Protestant basis, entwined with local politics of Northern Ireland, while the Movement for Christian Democracy was established on an inclusive Christian basis, with Protestant ''and'' Catholic involvement. A Christian democracy aimed at confronting secularism and representing Christians and their values in the United Kingdom in general.|group=note}} The movement existed as a cross-party [[advocacy group]] of sorts and although there were rumours in the media of it becoming a fully fledged political party it never materialised.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, ''Pressure Groups'', 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, out of the movement its chairman, Dr Alan Storkey, and vice-chairman, David Campanale, led an internal consultation of MCD members that led to the formation of the Christian Peoples Alliance by leading MCD activists in 1999. Elements of [[proportional representation]] at local government level, brought about after the devolution of the [[Scottish Parliament]] and [[Welsh Assembly]], saw the party gain confidence. By 2000, Ram Gidoomal had become leader of the party, a businessman and banker who had been appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]]. He had converted to Christianity from [[Hinduism]] and is a Briton of [[British Asian|Asian]] background.&lt;ref name="ram"&gt;{{cite news |title=Year of the Ram?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2004/jun/10/londonpolitics.elections2004|work=The Guardian | date=10 June 2004 | accessdate=24 March 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gidoomal stood for election for the [[London mayoral election, 2000]]. Gaining 98,549 votes at the first attempt, the party surprised some, finishing fifth, ahead of the [[Green Party of England and Wales|Greens]] in first preference votes.&lt;ref name="ram" /&gt; The campaign was committed to winning more jobs for Londoners, leading to ''[[The Times]]'' claiming, based on multiple choice results from a website run by ''[[New Statesman]]'': "if Londoners elected a mayor purely on how his or her policies match the electors' views [...] the winner would be Ram Gidoomal".&lt;ref&gt;Bolton, ''The Entrepreneur in Focus'', 188.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2000, a candidate supported by the Christian Peoples Alliance stood at the [[Preston by-election, 2000|Preston by-election]], finishing seventh.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.election.demon.co.uk/by1997.html Byelections in the 1997 parliament] Election Database&lt;/ref&gt;

===Craig leadership===
[[File:Alan craig cropped.jpg|130px|thumb|right|Alan Craig standing for London mayor in 2008.]]
Following on from this, the party continued its activities, mostly in London in such as fairly deprived working class areas like [[Canning Town]] in the [[London Borough of Newham]]. The Mayflower Declaration laid out the party's values and policies. It was at Canning Town in 2002 that [[Alan Craig]] became the first Christian Democrat elected in Britain, as a member of the local Newham council. The party voiced its opposition to the prospect of the [[Iraq War]], deeming it "illegal, unwise and immoral" — a position by which it has stood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Three years after war, 'Iraq is worse'|url=http://www.churchtimes.co.uk/content.asp?id=15240|work=Church Times|date=15 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[London mayoral election, 2004]], Gidoomal stepped down as party leader to be succeeded by Craig. The party stood members for the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election]] with little success, yet a "blind candidating" contest run by [[BBC]]'s ''[[Newsnight]]'' programme placed the party manifesto policies second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Christian Party Manifesto comes 2nd in Pre-General Election Newsnight Contest|url=http://www.christiantoday.co.uk/article/christian.party.manifesto.comes.2nd.in.pregeneral.election.newsnight.contest/2673.htm|website=ChristianToday.co.uk|date= 22 April 2005|accessdate = 3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party had more success in 2006, gaining two more council seats in Canning Town. In the following year, the party had two members elected at [[Parish councils in England|parish council]] level for [[Aston cum Aughton]] in the [[Metropolitan Borough of Rotherham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=More local councillors elected for Christian Peoples Alliance|url=http://www.ecpyn.org/k/9308/news/view/162537/124284/More-local-councillors-elected-for-Christian-Peoples-Alliance.html|publisher=European Christian Political Youth Network|accessdate=1 February 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120731172216/http://www.ecpyn.org/k/9308/news/view/162537/124284/More-local-councillors-elected-for-Christian-Peoples-Alliance.html|archivedate=31 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year, it also gained encouragement from Scottish Catholic bishops [[Keith O'Brien]] and [[Philip Tartaglia]] for its social stances, including marriage, rights for unborn children and supporting the Church in the adoption debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cardinal Throws Weight Behind Scottish Christian Democratic Party for Holyrood 2007 Elections|url=http://ischool.co.uk/CardinalThrowsWeightBehindScottishChristianDemocraticParty.htm|publisher=ischool.co.uk|accessdate=1 February 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818164616/http://ischool.co.uk/CardinalThrowsWeightBehindScottishChristianDemocraticParty.htm|archivedate=18 August 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party also defended the Anglican bishop [[Michael Nazir-Ali]] after comments made in the media regarding Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Christian Peoples Alliance defends bishop over Islam comments|url=http://www.christiantoday.co.uk/article/christian.peoples.alliance.defends.bishop.over.islam.comments/16023.htm|website=ChristianToday.co.uk|accessdate= 1 February 2009}}&lt;br&gt;- {{cite web |title=Sharia and the scare stories|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/andrewbrown/2011/jul/01/sharia-scare-stories-michael-nazir-ali|accessdate =21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CPA campaigned against the building of [[Abbey Mills Mosque]] in West Ham, planned by an alleged radical sect,{{refn|The sect known as [[Tablighi Jamaat]] are behind the planning.

==Ideology==
The party has campaigned on a range of issues, winning success in 2000 when it organised a petition against government plans to require Asian visitors to the UK to place a £10,000 'bond'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/684386.stm |title=Ram Gidoomal's London mission |work=BBC News |date=23 March 2000 |accessdate=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 and 2004 in London, it put inner-city regeneration and fighting discrimination as its top policy priorities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://christian-1.cust.host-it.co.uk/fed/resources/Passion_forLoSdon_manifesto.pdf Passion for London manifesto] {{dead link|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its policies to cut energy-use and road congestion through a [[Coachway|motorway coach-network]] won acceptance at government level.&lt;ref&gt;http://christian-1.cust.host-it.co.uk/fed/resources/TRANSPOR_TDO.pdf{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, http://www.bepj.org.uk/wordpress/wp-content/2007/03/motorway-based-coach-system.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Its policies in support of marriage and church schools have become popular currency among secular parties.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1566035/Minister-hints-at-tax-reforms-for-marriage.html "Minister hints at tax reforms for marriage", ''Daily Telegraph'']&lt;/ref&gt;
The CPA has also opposed the reclassification of cannabis,&lt;ref&gt;Key Policies, Christian Peoples Alliance, see http://christian-1.cust.host-it.co.uk/sco/index{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.
php?page=policies as at 17 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; When Craig became leader he introduced policies in favour of linking Christianity to the [[European Union Constitution]], building more [[church schools]] and supporting traditional Christian morality. He also has led campaigns backing the [[UNISON]] steward at [[Newham Council]] who faced disciplinary action; against plans to build London's large casino in Newham,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2007/01/31/anti_casino_feature.shtml |title=Say no to casino! |website=BBC |date=27 December 2007 |accessdate=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; against the Excel Arms Fair;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.caat.org.uk/press/archive.php?url=071205prs |title=CAAT Press Releases |website=Caat.org.uk |date= |accessdate=3 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120806235524/http://www.caat.org.uk/press/archive.php?url=071205prs |archivedate=6 August 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; against what he claims are [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]'s plans to move local families out of [[Canning Town]] in support of yuppie housing. Craig has also campaigned against proposals to demolish parts of Queen Street Market in favour of "non-invasive refurbishment"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.friendsofqueensmarket.org.uk/ |title=Queen's Market - St Modwen not wanted! |website=Friendsofqueensmarket.org.uk |date= |accessdate=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/feb/18/mainsection.guardianletters2 |title=Letters: Friends of Queens market set out their stall |work=The Guardian |date= 18 February 2006|accessdate=3 May 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CPA has contested local authority elections at parish, borough, city and county level in London, Glasgow, Sheffield, Leeds, Rotherham, Middlesbrough, Ipswich, Gloucester, Northampton and Suffolk. Since Cordle became leader, the party has focused more on putting up candidates in national elections and developing a comprehensive manifesto covering all issues of concern.. The party fought three regions in the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (United Kingdom)|2014 European Parliament elections]] and they had 17 candidates in the 2015 General Election and 31 in the 2017 one, a record number for the party.

===Same-sex marriage===
The party took a leading role{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} in the campaign against the [[Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013]] with its leader Sid Cordle speaking at a rally in Trafalgar Square. While the debates were taking place he spoke at a rally outside Westminster.

In May 2014, during the EU elections, under questioning from [[Andrew Neil]] on the BBC ''[[Daily Politics]]'' programme Cordle said that it was possible that recent storms in the UK could have been caused by God, saying, "I think all Christians believe that God does, and can do, things with nature. A lot of Christians believe God is angry over 'gay marriage' and God can show that anger if he wants to."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/05/16/gay-marriage-god-angry-video_n_5337491.html "Gay Marriage Made God Angry And He Is Probably Making It Rain Insists Christian People’s Alliance Leader"], ''Huffington Post UK'', 16 May 2014&lt;br&gt;- [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27443897 "God angry at gay marriage - Christian People's Alliance"], ''BBC News'', 16 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, on the ''Daily Politics'' show, Cordle was accused of 'embarrassing' himself and described as a 'bigot' by journalist [[Owen Jones (writer)|Owen Jones]] after claiming that marriage's sole purpose was the procreation of children.  Presenter [[Jo Coburn]] was forced to ask Cordle to allow Jones to speak on several occasions, however Cordle accused Jones of being 'insulting' and claimed Coburn's reluctance to allow him to respond to Jones as being 'fake news'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p052f7g5|title=What does Christian Peoples Alliance stand for?, 09/05/2017, Daily Politics - BBC Two|website=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic and European policy===
The Christian Peoples Alliance rejects [[class struggle]] doctrine and supports a [[Mixed economy|mixed market economy]], with an emphasis on the community, social solidarity, support for [[social welfare provision]] and some [[Regulatory economics|regulation]] of market forces. The central theme being [[social justice]], responsible [[charity (practice)|charity]] and an emphasis on "people before profit".&lt;ref name="mayflower"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpax.org.uk/cpa/Mayflower.php|title=Mayflower Declaration|publisher=Cpax.org.uk|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227080352/http://cpax.org.uk/cpa/Mayflower.php|archivedate=27 February 2009|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the Mayflower Declaration the party sets out as goals and desires; providing resources to discourage economic dependency and promote gainful employment. A [[holistic]] approach to care, which moves beyond mere financial assistance, as well as help for those in danger of being pushed to the margins of society, like the [[homeless]] and [[disabled]].&lt;ref name="mayflower" /&gt; The Mayflower Declaration was updated and reprinted in early 2013 just after Cordle became leader. It now has a new introduction and at the back the policy on Europe was changed from support for the EU to "While we are members of the European Union to work with fellow Christians to seek to bring about moral and democratic reform." It subsequently went further and in its 2014 European manifesto said it wanted a referendum on the EU and that if a referendum was held it would support leaving the EU.

==Election results==
The party has never won a seat as a [[Member of Parliament]]. However, it has won some [[local government]] council elections. In [[Newham London Borough Council]], [[Alan Craig]] was a councillor (2002-2010), as were Simeon Ademolake (2006–2010) and Denise Stafford (2006–2010). Paul Martin and David Gee were elected to [[Aston cum Aughton|Aston-cum-Aughton]] Parish Council (2007–2009).

'''Communicating vessels''' is a name given to a set of containers containing a homogeneous [[fluid]], connected at the base and subjected to the same atmospheric pressure. When the liquid settles, it balances out to the same level in all of the containers regardless of their shape and volume. If additional liquid is added to one vessel, the liquid will again find a new equal level in all the connected vessels. This process is part of [[Simon Stevin#Discoveries and inventions|Stevin's Law]]&lt;ref name="handbook"&gt;{{cite book

[[Blaise Pascal]] proved in the seventeenth century that the pressure exerted on a molecule of a liquid is transmitted in full and with the same intensity in all directions.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

== Applications ==
Since the days of ancient [[Rome]], the concept of communicating vessels has been used for indoor plumbing, via [[aquifer]]s and lead pipes. Water will reach the same level in all parts of the system, which acts as communicating vessels, regardless of what the lowest point is of the pipes &amp;ndash; although in practical terms the lowest point of the system depends on the ability of the plumbing to withstand the pressure of the liquid.  In cities, [[water towers]] are frequently used so that city plumbing will function as communicating vessels, distributing water to higher floors of buildings with sufficient pressure.

[[Hydraulic press]]es, using systems of communicating vessels, are widely used in various applications of industrial processes.

A '''counting agent''' is appointed by either the candidate standing for election or the candidate's [[election agent]] to oversee the counting at the election count.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/electoral_commission_pdf_file/0007/108934/The-count.pdf |title=The count |publisher=[[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)]] |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United Kingdom there is no legal requirement to appoint a counting officer. At [[elections in the Republic of Ireland]], counting agents are called '''tallymen'''; they keep track not only of first-preference votes but also of [[Single transferable vote|transfer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/politics/art-of-the-tallyman-returns-to-centre-stage-at-vote-counts-93540.html|title=Art of the tallyman returns to centre stage at vote counts|last=Regan|first=Mary|date=6 June 2009|work=[[Irish Examiner]]|accessdate=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of counting agents which can be appointed is determined by the [[returning officer]] of the election and is usually dependent on the number of counting clerks at the count. Counting agents are appointed after the period when nominations to the election are made. The election timetable will state when counting agents have to be appointed, typically a week before polling day.

The role of the counting agent is to oversee the count itself, though they may not touch any of the ballot papers and must act through the returning officer.

During counts, generally only the candidate, the candidate's partner and the candidate's counting agents may enter the place where counting takes place.

In [[computer security]], the "dancing pigs" is a term or problem that describes computer users' attitudes to computer security. It states that users will continue to pick an amusing graphic even if they receive a warning from security software that it is potentially dangerous. In other words, users choose their primary desire features without considering the security. "Dancing pigs" is generally used by tech experts and can be found in IT articles.

== Origins ==
The term has its origin in a remark by [[Edward Felten]] and [[Gary McGraw]]:
{{cquote|Given a choice between dancing pigs and security, users will pick dancing pigs every time.&lt;ref&gt;Gary McGraw and Edward Felten: ''[http://www.securingjava.com/ Securing Java]'' (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1999; {{ISBN|0-471-31952-X}}), Chapter one, Part seven&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Bruce Schneier]] states:
{{quote| The user's going to pick dancing pigs over security every time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mills|first=Elinor|title=Q&amp;A: Schneier warns of marketers and dancing pigs|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-27080_3-10381460-245.html|accessdate=12 February 2013|newspaper=CNET|date=October 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Bruce Schneier expands on this remark as follows:
{{quote|If [[J. Random Websurfer]] clicks on a button that promises dancing pigs on his computer monitor, and instead gets a hortatory message describing the potential dangers of the applet&amp;nbsp;— he's going to choose dancing pigs over computer security any day. If the computer prompts him with a warning screen like: "The applet DANCING PIGS could contain malicious code that might do permanent damage to your computer, steal your life's savings, and impair your ability to have children," he'll click OK without even reading it. Thirty seconds later he won't even remember that the warning screen even existed.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Schneier: ''[[Secrets and Lies (Schneier)|Secrets and Lies]]'' (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2000; {{ISBN|0-471-45380-3}}), p262&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Mozilla]] Security Reviewers' Guide states:
{{quote|Many of our potential users are inexperienced computer users, who do not understand the risks involved in using interactive Web content. This means we must rely on the user's judgement as little as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/components/reviewguide.html |title= Mozilla Security Review and Best Practices Guide |date= 17 May 2002 |accessdate= 2 February 2015 |publisher= [[Mozilla Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A widely publicized 2009 paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Please Do Not Change Your Password|url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2010/04/11/please_do_not_change_your_password/|first=Mark|last=Pothier|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=11 April 2010|accessdate= 2 February 2015|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; directly addresses the dancing pigs quotation and argues that users' behavior is plausibly rational:
{{quote|While amusing, this is unfair: users are never offered security, either on its own or as an alternative to anything else. They are offered long, complex and growing sets of advice, mandates, policy updates and tips. These sometimes carry vague and tentative suggestions of reduced risk, never security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|title=So Long and No Thanks for the Externalities: the Rational Rejection of Security Advice by Users|conference=New Security Paradigms Workshop|conferenceurl=http://www.nspw.org/2009/|year=2009|author=Cormac Herley|url=http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/cormac/papers/2009/SoLongAndNoThanks.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Experimental support ==
One study of [[phishing]] found that people really do prefer dancing animals to security. The study showed participants a number of phishing sites, including one that copied the [[Bank of the West]] home page:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Phishing Works|author=Rachna Dhamija, J. D. Tygar and Marti Hearst|url=http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~rachna/papers/why_phishing_works.pdf|accessdate=2011-05-25|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306023403/http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~rachna/papers/why_phishing_works.pdf|archivedate=2008-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|For many participants the "cute" design, the level of detail and the fact that the site does not ask for a great deal of information were the most convincing factors. Two participants mentioned the animated bear video that appears on the page, (e.g., "because that would take a lot of effort to copy"). Participants in general found this animation appealing and many reloaded the page just to see the animation again.}}

Schneier believes the dancing pigs problem will lead to crime, a key threat. He said: "The tactics might change (...) as security measures make some tactics harder and others easier, but the underlying issue is constant." Ignoring computer security can inflict various types of damage resulting in significant losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mills|first=Elinor|title=Q&amp;A: Schneier warns of marketers and dancing pigs|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-27080_3-10381460-245.html|accessdate=12 February 2013|newspaper=CNET|date=October 23, 2009|quote=The tactics might change--phishing, pharming, key logging, social engineering, password guessing, whatever--as security measures make some tactics harder and others easier, but the underlying issue is constant}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''De-escalation''' refers to behavior that is intended to escape [[Conflict escalation|escalations]] of [[Conflict (process)|conflicts]]. It may also refer to approaches in [[conflict resolution]]. [[Escalation of commitment|Escalations of commitment]] are often hard from spiraling out of proportions without specific measures being taken.

==Verbal De-escalation in Psychiatric Settings==
De-escalation is aimed at calmly communicating with an agitated client in order to understand, manage and resolve their concerns. Ultimately, these actions should help reduce the client’s agitation and potential for future aggression or violence. An inadequate intervention, or one occurring too late, may leave staff needing to utilize coercive measures to manage an aggressive or violent client.

The available literature provides clinical descriptions of effective de-escalation based on qualitative data and professional observations. However, these thematic analyses need to be supported by more objective data; one hallmark of such objectivity would be an empirical scale or quantitative measure of de-escalation.

==English Modified version of the ‘De-Escalating Aggressive Behaviour Scale’ (EMDABS)==

1. '''Valuing the client:''' Provides genuine acknowledgement that the client’s concerns are valid, important and will be addressed in a meaningful way.

2. '''Reducing fear:''' Listens actively to the client and offers genuine empathy while suggesting that the client’s situation has the potential for positive future change.

3. '''Inquiring about client’s queries and anxiety:''' Can communicate a thorough understanding of the client’s concerns, and works to uncover
the root of the issue.

4. '''Providing guidance to the client:''' Suggests multiple ways to the help the client with their current concerns and recommends preventative measures.

5. '''Working out possible agreements:''' Takes responsibility for the client’s care and concludes the encounter with an agreed-upon short-term solution and a long-term action plan.

6. '''Remaining calm:''' Maintains a calm tone of voice and steady pace that is appropriate to the client’s feelings and behaviour.

7. '''Risky:''' Maintains a moderate distance from the client to ensure safety, but does not appear guarded and fearful.

A '''''{{lang|pt|donatário}}''''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for "donated" or "endowed [one]"), sometimes anglicized as '''donatary''', was a private person—often a noble—who was granted a considerable piece of land (a ''{{lang|pt|[[donataria]]}}'') by the [[Kingdom of Portugal]]. The [[kings of Portugal|king]] exempted these titleholders from normal [[Portuguese colonization|colonial administration]]; the donatários were comparable to a royal governor or a British [[Lord Proprietor]]. As the ''donataria'' were often [[captaincy|captaincies]], the position is also translated as '''captain'''.

==History==
[[File:Corbitis Atlas (Azores detail).jpg|thumb|170px|A anonymous Venetian map of the islands of the Azores (Biblioteca Nazionale Marciana), Venice]] 
Normally, the ''donatário'' was the recipient of a [[captaincy]], a territorial division and land grant, within Portuguese colonies.&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/168977/donatario |title=Donatário |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=8 August 2013 |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was an effective administrative system that ceded certain rights and responsibilities to the ''donatário'', facilitating the settlement of unpopulated places with little cost to the Crown.&lt;ref name="Costa231"&gt;Susana Goulart Costa (2008), p.231&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''donatário'' was obligated to govern his territories under specific terms: in exchange for the grant, he received tax immunity, but was also responsible for promoting and settling new residents to his territory, establishing churches (following the Catholic faith), protecting them from frequent pirate attacks, and promoting agriculture and commerce.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; While the donatário assumed expenses of the settlement and economic development, he also benefited from various judicial and fiscal privileges, while the King maintained certain unalienable rights to safeguard the territorial and political unity of the Kingdom.&lt;ref name=Costa231/&gt; Except for private land grants, the territory administrated by the donatário was turned over to settlers and the bestowed was responsible for all the expenses of the Captaincy.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

Almost dictatorial in their powers, the ''donatários'' were limited by the difficulties of the territories they governed.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; With the Brazilian territories, which were large, the donatários' obligations covered the governorship, expansion and settlement of the territory, necessitating a large labour force, security forces and administrators.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; Many of the new settlers were criminals, opportunists or political exiles who arrived in these territories to make their fortunes (commercially or politically). At the same time, the donatário promoted the faith by receiving and assisting the Catholic missionaries that trekked across the Portuguese Empire.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

===Donatários===
After their discovery, the islands of the Azores were bestowed by the Crown of Portugal to [[Henry the Navigator|Prince Henry the Navigator]], son of [[John I of Portugal|King João I]], who in turn donated them to the [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Order of Christ]], of which he was master. The order of succession remained in the hands of the [[Duke of Viseu|Dukes of Viseu]] and progressed as follows:

* [[Henry the Navigator|Infante Henry, 1st Duke of Viseu]], (1432-1460)
* [[Infante Ferdinand, Duke of Viseu|Infante Ferdinand, 2nd Duke of Viseu]] (1460-1470)
* [[John, Duke of Viseu|Infante John, 3rd Duke of Viseu]] (1470-1472)
* [[Diogo, Duke of Viseu|Infante Diogo, 4th Duke of Viseu]] (1472-1484)
* [[Manuel I of Portugal|Infante Manuel, 5th Duke of Viseu]] (1484-1495)

The Dukes were the direct line to the Crown, paying vassalage as serfs to the Kings of Portugal. When Manuel, 5th Duke of Viseu, ascended the throne as King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] (1495), he incorporated the donatary privileges of the seven islands of the Azores (Corvo and Flores were not included) into the properties and possessions of the Crown.

The donatary system was bestowed upon Henry the Navigator at an unknown time, but his order to introduce livestock (goats, cattle, pigs, etc.) on the islands suggests that he would have received jurisdiction between 1432 and 1438.&lt;ref name="Costa232"&gt;Susana Goulart Costa (2008), p.232&lt;/ref&gt; This was the same period as the death of King [[Edward of Portugal|Duarte]], and his successor King [[Afonso V of Portugal|Afonso V]] exempted fees and taxes for five years at his request, suggesting Henry's compliance with the duties of a ''donatário''.&lt;ref name=Costa232/&gt; Yet it was only in his last will and testament that it was explicitly stated that he was protector of the Azores.&lt;ref name=Costa232/&gt; The transfer of this title to his nephew the Infante Ferdinand, was in keeping with the ''Lei Mental'' proclaimed by his brother in 1434, that bound Henry to pass on all lands and goods from the King to legitimate male descendants.&lt;ref name=Costa232/&gt; If not, then the Crown would regain ownership.&lt;ref name=Costa232/&gt;

The ''donatário'' was expected to promote the settlement of the territory.&lt;ref name=Costa232/&gt; Consequently, the hierarchical model that developed was an extension of this process.&lt;ref name=Costa232/&gt; In order to govern the islands, Henry as ''donatário'' nominated men of confidence, ''capitães do donatário'' (''Captains of the Donatary''), to administer their territories locally.&lt;ref name=Costa232/&gt; This three-tier system worked effectively: King, ''donatário'', and captains allowed the administration of overseas territories without direct intervention of the Crown.&lt;ref name=Costa232/&gt;{{refn|group=n|Many of these donatary-captains were also represented by proxies, known as ''ouvidores do capitão'' (''ombudspersons'') whose responsibility was to locally manage their affairs, administer rental lands and "listen" to the local community.}}

Yet the Crown oscillated between total neglect and strong vigilance; between the 15th-18th centuries the monarchy did not really know how to manage its territories.&lt;ref name="Costa233"&gt;Susana Goulart Costa (2008), p.233&lt;/ref&gt; King [[Manuel I of Portugal]], for his part, was a micro-manager and was involved in judicial affairs and exercised his duties as lord of the islands.&lt;ref name=Costa233/&gt; This led to the creation of monarchial posts to directly influence control, such as the [[Corregedor]], the ''Provedoria das Armadas'' (''Office of the Purveyor of Armadas''), 1527, and the ''Feitorias'' (''Customs Offices'') of Angra and Ponta Delgada, in 1561.&lt;ref name="Costa234"&gt;Susana Goulart Costa (2008), p.234&lt;/ref&gt; These new posts showed the importance of the Crown's representatives in the regions over their control, and men like Cipriano de Figueiredo e Vasconcelos (Corregador of Terceira) would play important roles in coexistence between local and national administration.&lt;ref name=Costa234/&gt;

After the 16th century the figure of the donatary captain lost its effective governorship in most of the islands of the Azores, with the exception of [[São Miguel Island|São Miguel]], which was transformed into an honorific post, conferred by the King to people and noble families who he wished to honour. It was through this system that the majority of donatary captaincies fell into the hands of the high nobility of Portugal, who never lived on the islands or had little economic interest in their development.

The '''Central and Eastern European anti-Communist insurgencies''' fought on after the official end of the [[Second World War]] against the [[Soviet Union]] and the communist states formed under Soviet occupation and support.

Prominent movements include:
*The [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]] fought until eradicated in 1956.
*The anti-Soviet [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]] took place in 1956.
*Baltic partisans knew as the "[[Forest Brothers]]" fought until eradicated in the early 1960s.
*[[Romanian anti-communist resistance movement]] fought until eradicated in 1962.
*Polish partisans known as the "[[Cursed soldiers]]" fought until eradicated in 1963.
*Bulgarian partisans known as "[[Goryani]]" fought until eradicated in the early 1960s.
*Croatian partisans knew as "[[Crusaders (guerrilla)|Crusaders]]" fought until eradicated in the early 1950s.
*[[Albanian Subversion|Albanian partisans]] (members of the [[Balli Kombëtar]] and supporters of the king [[Zog I]]) fought until eradicated in the early 1950s.
*Serbian partisans knew as "[[Chetniks]]" fought until eradicated in the early 1950s.
*Slovenian partisans fought until eradicated in the early 1950s.
*Moldovian partisans ([[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina]]) fought until eradicated in the early 1950s.
*[[Belarusian Black Cats|Belarusian partisans]] fought until eradicated in the early 1950s.

==In Poland==

[[File:Józef Kuras Ogień.jpg|thumb|170px|right|[[Józef Kuraś]], leader of the [[anti-communist resistance in Poland|anti-communist resistance]]]]

The 'cursed soldiers' (Polish: Żołnierze wyklęci) is a name applied to a variety of [[Poles|Polish]] resistance movements that were formed in the later stages of World War II and afterward. Created by former members of the Polish underground resistance organizations of World War II, these organizations continued the struggle against the pro-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] government of Poland well into the 1950s.

Most of these anti-communist groups ceased operations in the late 1940s or 1950s. However, the last known 'cursed soldier', [[Józef Franczak]], was killed in an ambush as late as 1963, almost 20 years after the [[People's Republic of Poland|Soviet take-over of Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://prawica.net/index.php?q=node/2269 „Lalek” ostatni partyzant Rzeczypospolitej]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091025092721/http://prawica.net/index.php?q=node%2F2269 |date=October 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Baltic States==

[[File:Ants Kaljurand.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ants Kaljurand]], Estonian resistance fighter for the [[Forest Brothers]]]]
The [[Forest Brothers]] (also: Brothers of the Forest, Forest Brethren; Forest Brotherhood; Estonian: metsavennad, Latvian: meža brāļi, Lithuanian: miško broliai) were Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian partisans who waged [[guerrilla warfare]] against Soviet rule during the Soviet invasion and occupation of the three [[Baltic states]] during, and after, World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buttar|first=Prit|title=Between Giants, the Battle for the Baltics in World War II|year=2013|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=9781780961637}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[Soviet Army]] occupied the independent Baltic states in 1940–1941 and, after a period of German occupation, again in 1944–1945. As [[Stalinist]] repression intensified over the following years, 50,000 residents of these countries used the heavily [[forest]]ed countryside as a natural refuge and base for armed anti-Soviet resistance.

Resistance units varied in size and composition, ranging from individually operating guerrillas, armed primarily for self-defense, to large and well-organized groups able to engage significant Soviet forces in battle.

[[File:RezistantaRomanaAntiCommunista-Ion-Gavrila-Ogoranu-tanar.jpg|thumb|160px|Ion Gavrila Ogoranu, leader of [[Fagaras]] resistance movement]]

==In Romania==

An armed resistance movement against the communist regime in [[Romania]] was active from the late 40s to the mid-50s, with isolated individual fighters remaining at large until the early 1960s. The groups were concentrated in the [[Carpathian Mountains]], although a resistance movement had also developed in [[Northern Dobruja]]. Armed resistance was the most structured form of resistance against the communist regime. After the overthrow of [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]] in 1989, the details about what was called “anti-communist armed resistance” were made public, thanks to the discretization of the [[Securitate]] archives.&lt;ref&gt;Ion Gavrilă Ogoranu, ''Brazii se frâng dar nu se îndoiesc'', vol II, Editura Marineasa, Timișoara, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Burma}}
Historically strained, '''Myanmar's foreign relations''', particularly with Western nations, have improved since 2012. Relations became strained once more in 2017 with the [[2017 Rohingya persecution in Myanmar|Rohingya crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/17/us/politics/myanmar-sanctions-rohingya.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.canada.ca/en/global-affairs/news/2018/02/canada_imposes_targetedsanctionsinresponsetohumanrightsviolation.html&lt;/ref&gt; Myanmar (also known as Burma) has generally maintained warmer relations with neighbouring states and is a member of the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]].

== Europe and America ==
The United States has placed broad sanctions on Burma because of the [[8888 Uprising|military crackdown in 1988]] and the military regime's refusal to honour the [[Burmese general election, 1990|election results of the 1990]] People's Assembly election. Similarly, the [[European Union]] has placed embargoes on Burma, including an arms embargo, cessation of trade preferences, and suspension of all aid with the exception of [[humanitarian aid]].&lt;ref name="EU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/comm/external_relations/myanmar/intro/index.htm |title= The EU's relations with Burma / Myanmar |accessdate=13 July 2006 |publisher=[[European Union]]|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060725000750/http://ec.europa.eu/comm/external_relations/myanmar/intro/index.htm |archivedate = 25 July 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

US and European government sanctions against the military government, alongside boycotts and other types of direct pressure on corporations by western supporters of the Burmese democracy movement, have resulted in the withdrawal from Burma of most US and many European companies. However, several Western companies remain due to loopholes in the sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=3986 The List: Burma’s Economic Lifelines]. ''[[Foreign Policy]]''. October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Asian corporations have generally remained willing to continue investing in Burma and to initiate new investments, particularly in [[natural resource]] extraction.

The French oil company [[Total S.A.]] is able to operate the [[Yadana Project|Yadana natural gas pipeline]] from Burma to Thailand despite the [[European Union]]'s sanctions on Burma. Total is currently the subject of a lawsuit in French and Belgian courts for the condoning and use of Burman civilian slavery to construct the named pipeline. Experts{{who|date=January 2013}} say that the human rights abuses along the gas pipeline are the direct responsibility of Total S.A. and its American partner [[Chevron Corporation]]{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} with aid and implementation by the [[Tatmadaw]]. Prior to its acquisition by Chevron, [[Unocal]] settled a similar human rights lawsuit for a reported multimillion-dollar amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Horsley |first=William |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3761022.stm |title=Dilemma of dealing with Burma |publisher=BBC News|date=20 October 2004 |accessdate=2 November 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There remains active debate as to the extent to which the American-led sanctions have had adverse effects on the civilian population or on the military rulers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hiatt |first=Fred |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;contentId=A21505-2003Jun22 |title=How Best to Rid the World of Monsters |publisher=Washington Post|date=23 June 2003 |accessdate=24 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/obl/reg.burma/archives/199905/msg00184.html |title=Reuters Belgian group seeks Total boycott over Myanmar |work=Ibiblio |publisher=Reuters |date=10 May 1999 |accessdate=24 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Assistance to Burma====
Development assistance to Burma is a top priority of the [[Danish International Development Agency]]'s engagement in Southeast Asia. 93 million DKK was given to education and healthcare projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Danish development assistance has focused on promoting democracy and human rights.

====Burmese Consul incident====
In 1996, the consul in Burma for Denmark, James Leander Nichols, was sentenced to three years in jail. The sentence was for illegal possession of two facsimile machines and a telephone switchboard. Two months later, he died in prison. Despite Danish insistence, Burmese authorities refused to allow an independent [[autopsy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Anais Tamen|title=The European Union’s Sanctions Related to Human Rights: The Case of Myanmar|url=http://www.burmalibrary.org/docs09/Memoire-Anais_Tamen.pdf|quote=|date=2002–2003|page= 98|accessdate=8 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, the [[European Union]], with Canada, called for a United Nations gathering on the democratisation process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=James Leander Nichol's Death Imprisoned For Owning an Illegal Fax Machine in Burma|url=http://www.cfob.org/burmaissue/politicalPrisoners/JLNichols.shtml|publisher=CFOB Canadian Friends of Burma|quote=|date=|pages=|accessdate=23 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501061942/http://www.cfob.org/burmaissue/politicalPrisoners/JLNichols.shtml|archive-date=1 May 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Response of the Union of Myanmar to the United Nations|url=http://www.cfob.org/Background/JLNichols.shtml|publisher=CFOB Canadian Friends of Burma|quote=|date=|pages=|accessdate=23 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501061939/http://www.cfob.org/Background/JLNichols.shtml|archive-date=1 May 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Day's Work Day====
On 3 November 2010, students from 140 different [[Gymnasium (Denmark)|gymnasiums]] in Denmark and [[DanChurchAid]], participated in the annual Day's Work Day. The money earned by the students goes to improve education for young people in Burma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=21.000 gymnasieelever arbejder onsdag for bedre uddannelse i Burma|language=Danish|url=http://www.u-landsnyt.dk/nyhed/01-11-10/21000-gymnasieelever-arbejder-onsdag-bedre-uddanne|publisher=U-landsnyt.dk|quote=|date=1 November 2010|accessdate=23 January 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427233255/http://www.u-landsnyt.dk/nyhed/01-11-10/21000-gymnasieelever-arbejder-onsdag-bedre-uddanne|archivedate=27 April 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
{{see also|Foreign relations of Ireland}}
The Government of Ireland established diplomatic relations with Burma on a non-resident basis on 10 February 2004. The Irish Government was still concerned about the [[arbitrary detention]] of the opposition leader [[Aung San Suu Kyi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfa.ie/home/index.aspx?id=25837 |title=Department of Foreign Affairs – Ireland establishes diplomatic relations with Myanmar (Burma) |publisher=Dfa.ie |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burma Action Ireland is a pro-democracy group that freely operates in the Republic of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burmaactionireland.org/cont.html |title=Burma Action Ireland |publisher=Burma Action Ireland |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indymedia.ie/article/88630 |title=Free Burma – Indymedia Ireland |publisher=Indymedia.ie |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ireland supported a UN commission of inquiry and international level monitoring of Burma after 2008, as part of their efforts to support democracy and human rights movements in Burma. This became public knowledge after official papers were leaked in September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mizzima.com/news/world/4405-ireland-weighs-in-on-un-inquiry-into-burma-abuses.html |title=Ireland weighs in on UN inquiry into Burma abuses |publisher=Mizzima.com |date=25 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501000521/http://www.mizzima.com/news/world/4405-ireland-weighs-in-on-un-inquiry-into-burma-abuses.html |archivedate=1 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
{{main article|Burma–France relations}}
Franco-Burmese relations go back to the early 18th century, as the [[French East India Company]] attempted to extend its influence into Southeast Asia. French involvement started in 1729 when it built a shipyard in the city of [[Thanlyin|Syriam]].&lt;ref&gt;South (2003), p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; The 1740 revolt of the [[Mon State|Mon]] against Burmese rule, however, forced the French to depart in 1742.&lt;ref&gt;Liang (1990), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; They were able to return to [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siam]] in 1751 when the Mon requested French assistance against the Burmese. A French envoy, [[Sieur de Bruno]] was sent to evaluate the situation and help in the defence against the Burmese. French warships were sent to support the Mon rebellion, but in vain. In 1756, the Burmese under [[Alaungpaya]] vanquished the Mon. Many French were captured and incorporated into the Burmese Army as an elite gunner corps, under [[Chevalier Milard]]. In 1769, official contacts resumed when a trade treaty was signed between [[Hsinbyushin|King Hsinbyushin]] and the French East India Company.&lt;ref&gt;Bhuyan (1974), p. 460&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after, however, France was convulsed by the [[French Revolution]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]], thus allowing overwhelming British influence in Burma. French contacts with Burma, effectively a British colony, became almost non-existent. Instead, from the second half of the 19th century, France concentrated on the establishment of [[French Indochina]] and the conflicts with China leading to the [[Sino-French War]]. Following the end of [[World War II]], ambassador-level diplomatic relationships between France and Burma were established in 1948, soon after the Burmese nation became an independent republic on 4 January 1948, as ''Union of Burma'', with [[Sao Shwe Thaik]] as its first President and [[U Nu]] as its first [[Prime Minister of Burma|Prime Minister]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ambafrance-mm.org/|title=La France en Birmanie|website=Ambafrance-mm.org|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{main article|Burma–United States relations}}
The political relations between the United States of America and Burma began to face major problems following the 1988 military coup and the [[Military junta|junta]]'s outbursts of repression against pro-democracy activists. Subsequent repression, including that of protestors in September 2007, further strained the relationship. However, following signs of democratisation and [[Economic liberalism|economic liberalisation]], [[Hillary Clinton]], as Secretary of State, and others called for the mending of America's relations with Burma in 2011.&lt;ref name="NYTimes.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/02/world/asia/us-will-relax-curbs-on-aid-to-myanmar.html | work=The New York Times | title=Clinton Says U.S. Will Relax Some Curbs on Aid to Myanmar | date=1 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the refurbishment of ties, the [[Government of the United States|American authorities]] in 2012 planned for the re-establishment of ambassador-level relations with Burma for the first time since 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304072004577323451080077384 | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Patrick | last=Barta | title=U.S. Forges Deeper Myanmar Ties | date=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Historic relations and diplomacy ====
Massachusetts, as a US state, attempted to place [[Massachusetts Burma Law|sanctions against Burma on its own]] in 1996 but the concept proved to be contradictory to the [[US Constitution]]. Later, the United States federal government imposed broad sanctions against Burma under several different legislative and policy vehicles. The [[Burma Freedom and Democracy Act]] (BFDA), passed by both the [[US Senate]] and their House of Representatives and signed by then President [[George W. Bush]] in 2003, imposed a ban on all imports from Burma, a ban on the export of financial services to Burma, a freeze on the assets of certain Burmese financial institutions, alongside further [[Visa (document)|visa]] restrictions against Burmese officials. American legislators then renewed the BFDA on an almost annual basis, most recently in July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://democracyforburma.wordpress.com/2010/07/23/burmese-freedom-and-democracy-act-passed-both-houses-of-congress-with-more-support-than-in-any-other-year/ |title=Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act passed both Houses of Congress |publisher=Democracyforburma.wordpress.com |date=23 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Embassy of Myanmar, Washington.jpg|thumb|righ|175px|[[Embassy of Myanmar in Washington, D.C.|Embassy of Burma]] in Washington, D.C..]]

Since 27 September 2007, the US Department of Treasury froze assets of 25 high-ranking officials Burmese government officials as it was authorised to do so by Executive Order 13310. On 19 October 2007, President George W. Bush imposed a new Executive Order (E.O. 13448) authorising the freezing of assets against individuals who stand accused by the [[Government of the United States]] of being party to human rights violations and acts of public corruption, as well as against those who provide material and financial support to the military junta.

In addition, since May 1997, the US Government prohibited new investment by American people and other entities. A number of American companies exited the Burma market prior to the imposition of sanctions due to a worsening business climate and mounting criticism from human rights groups, consumers, and shareholders. The United States has also imposed countermeasures on Burma due to its inadequate measures to eliminate [[money laundering]].

Due to its particularly severe violations of [[religious freedom]], the United States has designated Burma a [[Country of Particular Concern]] (CPC) under the International Religious Freedom Act. Burma is also designated a Tier 3 Country in the Trafficking in Persons Report for utilising [[forced labour]], and is subject to additional sanctions as a result. The political relationship between the United States and Burma worsened after the 1988 military coup and violent suppression of pro-democracy demonstrations. Subsequent repression, including the brutal crackdown on peaceful protestors in September 2007, further strained relations.

The United States lowered its level of representation in Burma from Ambassador to [[Chargé d'Affaires]] after the government's major outbreaks against opposition groups and protesters in 1988 and its alleged failure to honour the results of the 1990 parliamentary election, although it upgraded back on 13 January 2012,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)– US to exchange ambassadors with Burma, &lt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-16554415&gt;.

====Recent moves====
[[File:Obama-thein-sein.jpg|thumb|Thein Sein meets US President [[Barack Obama]] in [[Rangoon]]/Yangon, the former capital, on 19 November 2012]]
US Secretary of State, [[Hillary Clinton]], visited Burma in November–December 2011. In this visit, the first by a Secretary of State since 1955, Hillary met with the [[President of Burma]], [[Thein Sein]], in the official capital [[Naypyidaw]], and later met with democracy activist [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] in Yangon. The US announced a reduction of laws against providing aid to Burma and raised the possibility of an exchange of ambassadors.&lt;ref name="NYTimes.com"/&gt;

On 13 January 2012, the US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced the US will exchange ambassadors with Burma, after a landmark Burmese political prisoner amnesty.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

On Thursday, 17 May 2012, the [[White House Press Office]] announced that President [[Barack Obama]] of the [[US Democratic Party]] had nominated [[Derek Mitchell]] to the US Senate for confirmation to serve as US Ambassador to Burma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/05/17/statement-president-burma |title=Statement by the President on Burma &amp;#124; The White House |publisher=Whitehouse.gov |date=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/05/17/presidential-nomination-sent-senate |title=Presidential Nomination Sent to the Senate &amp;#124; The White House |publisher=Whitehouse.gov |date=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being approved by the US Senate in late June, Derek Mitchell, the first U.S ambassador to Myanmar in 22 years formally assumed his job on 11 July 2012 by presenting his credentials to President Thein Sein at the presidential mansion in the capital Naypyitaw.&lt;ref name="RFA20120711" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vandenbrink"/&gt;

In July 2012 the United States formally reduced sanctions against Burma.&lt;ref name="NYT20120711"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lowrey|first=Annie|title=U.S. Sanctions on Myanmar Formally Eased|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/12/world/asia/us-sanctions-on-myanmar-formally-eased.html|accessdate=12 July 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton announced plans in the spring of 2012 for a “targeted easing” of sanctions to allow minor US investment in the country, but companies could not move ahead until the sanctions were formally suspended.&lt;ref name="NYT20120711" /&gt; In July 2012, President Obama ordered the US State Department to issue two special licences, one providing special authorisation to invest in Burma and the other authorising to provide financial services in Burma.&lt;ref name="RFA20120711" /&gt; Although plans to lift investment restrictions were announced in May 2012, the change awaited what administration officials labelled 'detailed reporting requirements' on US companies doing business in Burma, alongside the creation of mechanisms to prevent US economic ties to the powerful Burmese military and individuals and companies involved in human rights abuses.&lt;ref name="WP20120712"&gt;{{cite news|last=DeYoung|first=Karen|title=Ban on U.S. investment in Burma is lifted|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/ban-on-us-investment-in-burma-is-lifted/2012/07/11/gJQADMCxdW_story.html?wp_login_redirect=0|accessdate=12 July 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Obama also issued an executive order expanding existing sanctions against individuals who violate human rights to include those who threaten Burma’s political restructuring process.&lt;ref name="WP20120712" /&gt;

President Obama created a new power for the US government to impose “blocking sanctions” on any individual threatening peace in Myanmar.

In May 2013, Sein became the first Myanmar president to visit the US White House in 47 years and President Barack Obama praised the former general for political and economic reforms, and the cessation of tensions between Myanmar and the US Political activists objected to the visit due to concerns over human rights abuses in Myanmar but Obama assured Sein that Myanmar will receive the support from the US. Prior to President Sein, the last Myanmar leader to visit the White House was Ne Win in September 1966. The two leaders discussed Sein's intention to release more political prisoners, the institutionalisation of political reform and rule of law, and ending ethnic conflict in Myanmar—the two governments agreed to sign a bilateral trade and investment framework agreement on 21 May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obama Vows US Support As Myanmar Leader Visits|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=185449969|accessdate=21 May 2013|newspaper=NPR|date=20 May 2013|author=The Associated Press|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521150924/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=185449969|archive-date=21 May 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
{{main article|Burma–Russia relations}}
Bilateral relations with the [[Russian Federation]] are among the strongest enjoyed by largely isolated Burma. Russia had established diplomatic relations with Burma at independence and these continued after the fall of the [[Soviet Union]]. China and Russia once vetoed a [[U.N. Security Council]] resolution designed to punish Burma.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7011746.stm Chinese dilemma over Burma] (25 September 2007). BBC.

==Association of Southeast Asian Nations==
Burma is a member of the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) and part of [[ASEAN+3]] and the [[East Asia Summit]]. Burma agreed to relinquish its turn to hold the rotating ASEAN presidency in 2006 due to others member states' concern of its previous democratic situation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nenepimentel.org/speeches/20051202_Myanmar.asp More Deadly Than Avian Flu (Or Why the Myanmar Regime Must Implement The Road Map To Democracy)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204073651/http://www.nenepimentel.org/speeches/20051202_Myanmar.asp |date=4 February 2012 }}.

Asean has announced that it shall not provide defence for Burma at any international forum regarding the [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] junta's refusal to restore democracy. In April 2007, the Malaysian Foreign Ministry parliamentary secretary [[Ahmad Shabery Cheek]] said that Malaysia and other Asean members had decided not to defend Burma if the country was raised for discussion at any international conference. "Now Burma has to defend itself if it was bombarded at any international forum," he said when winding up a debate at committee stage for the Foreign Ministry. He was replying to queries from Opposition Leader [[Lim Kit Siang]] on the next course of action to be taken by Malaysia and Asean with the Burmese military junta. Lim had said Malaysia must play a proactive role in pursuing regional initiatives to bring about a change in Burma and support efforts to bring the situation in Burma to the [[UN Security Council]]'s attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Asean Will Not Defend Myanmar at International Fora – Ahmad Shabery |publisher=Bernama |date=19 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, ASEAN did take a stronger tone with Burma, particularly regards to the detention of now-released [[Aung San Suu Kyi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/8056852.stm Asian leaders condemn Burma trial].

{{See also|Burma–Thailand relations }}

Relations between Burma and [[Thailand]] focus mainly on economic issues and trade. There is sporadic conflict with Thailand over the alignment of the border.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Recently, Prime Minister [[Abhisit Vejjajiva]] made it clear that dialogue encouraging political change is a priority for Thailand, but not through economic sanctions.

Burma has diplomatic offices in [[Bangkok]] whilst Thailand maintains an embassy in Rangoon.

===Philippines===
Philippines established relations with Burma in 1956 and recognised its political name Myanmar. In 2012, Myanmar ranked 3rd to the lowest among the Philippines' trading partners in ASEAN. It only fared better than Cambodia and Laos. The Philippines and Myanmar traded only $47.07 million in 2012. The Philippines grant Burmese citizens visa-free access for 30 days. Myanmar on the other hand signed the visa exemption for Filipinos on 5 December 2013 effective 4 January 2014. The agreement allows Filipinos to stay in Myanmar up to 14 days visa-free.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.dfa.gov.ph/index.php/2013-06-27-21-50-36/dfa-releases/1829-phl-myanmar-agreement-on-visa-exemption-takes-effect-on-january-4-2014 |title=Archived copy |access-date=1 January 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102194106/https://www.dfa.gov.ph/index.php/2013-06-27-21-50-36/dfa-releases/1829-phl-myanmar-agreement-on-visa-exemption-takes-effect-on-january-4-2014 |archive-date=2 January 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==China==
{{Main article|Burma – People's Republic of China relations}}
The People's Republic of China had poor relations with Burma until the late 1980s. Between 1967 and 1970, Burma broke relations with Beijing because of the latter's support for the [[Communist Party of Burma]] (CPB).&lt;ref name=singh&gt;Singh (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deng Xiaoping]] visited Yangon in 1978 and withdrew support for the long running insurgency of the [[Communist Party of Burma]].&lt;ref name=singh/&gt; However, in the early 1950s Burma enjoyed a hot-and-cold relationship with China. Burma's [[U သန္႕]] and [[U Nu]] lobbied for China's entry as a permanent member into the UN Security Council, but denounced the [[Invasion of Tibet (1950–1951)|invasion of Tibet]].&lt;ref&gt;Bingham (1966), p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;
China and Burma have had many border disputes, dating long before the British annexation of Burma. The last border dispute culminated in 1956, when the [[People's Liberation Army]] invaded northern Burma, but were repulsed.&lt;ref&gt;Silverstein (1980), p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; A border agreement was reached in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur (1974), p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;
In the late 1960s, due to [[Ne Win]]'s propaganda that the PRC was to blame for crop failures, and the increasing number of ethnic Chinese students supporting Chairman [[Mao Zedong]], by carrying the [[Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong|Quotatians from his]] books, anti-Chinese riots broke out in June 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Seekins (2006), p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, many Sino-Burmese were influenced by the [[Cultural Revolution]] in China and began to wear [[Chairman Mao badge|Mao badges]].&lt;ref&gt;Lintner (1990), p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Shops and homes were ransacked and burned. The Chinese government heavily berated the Burmese government and started a [[war of words]], but no other actions were taken. The anti-Chinese riots continued till the early 1970s.
However, after 1986, China withdrew support for the CPB&lt;ref&gt;Pillali, Sushil K. [http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/publication/faultlines/volume7/Fault7-GenPillaiF.htm The Invisible Country Ethnicity &amp; Conflict Management in Myanmar]. South Asia Terrorism Portal. Institute for Conflict Management&lt;/ref&gt; and began supplying the military junta with the majority of its arms in exchange for increased access to Burmese markets and a rumoured naval base on [[Coco Islands]] in the [[Andaman Sea]]. China is supposed to have an intelligence gathering station on the [[Great Coco Island]] to monitor Indian naval activity and [[ISRO]] &amp; [[DRDO]] missile and space launch activities. The influx of Chinese arms turned the tide in Burma against the ethnic insurgencies, many of which had relied indirectly on Chinese complicity. As a result, the military junta of Burma is highly reliant on the Chinese for their currently high level of power.
Burma maintains diplomatic offices in Beijing and consular offices in [[Kunming]] and Hong Kong, whilst the PRC has a diplomatic mission in Rangoon and a consulate in Mandalay.

==India==
{{main article|Burma–India relations}}
{{Politics of India}}
Bilateral relations between Burma and the Republic of [[India]] have improved considerably since 1993, overcoming disagreements related to drug trafficking, the suppression of democracy and the rule of the [[State Peace and Development Council|military junta]] in Burma. Burma is situated to the south of the states of [[Mizoram]], [[Manipur]], [[Nagaland]] and [[Arunachal Pradesh]] in [[Northeast India]]. The proximity of the People's Republic of China give strategic importance to Indo-Burmese relations. The Indo-Burmese border stretches over 1,600&amp;nbsp;kilometers.&lt;ref name="VJ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/reports/CB21Ai01.html#top5 |title=Myanmar shows India the road to Southeast Asia |publisher=Atimes.com |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; India is generally friendly with Burma, but is concerned by the flow of tribal refugees and the arrest of [[Aung San Suu Kyi]].

As a result of increased Chinese influence in Burma as well as the safe haven and [[arms trafficking]] occurring along the Indo-Burmese border, India has sought in recent years to refurbish ties with the [[Union of Burma]].&lt;ref&gt;Jagan, Larry.

In an interview on the [[BBC]], [[George Fernandes]], former Indian Defence Minister and prominent Burma critic, said that [[Coco Island]] was part of India until it was donated to Burma by former [[Prime Minister of India]] [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]. Coco Island is located at 18&amp;nbsp;km from the Indian [[Nicobar Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;Nanda (2003), p. 596&lt;/ref&gt;

Burma has a fully operating embassy based in New Delhi and India has one in Rangoon, the former capital of Burma. Like the PRC, the Republic of India maintains a [[Consulate-General]] in Mandalay.

===Economic relations===
India is the largest market for Burmese exports, buying about US$220 million worth of goods in 2000; India's exports to Burma stood at US$75.36 million.&lt;ref name="VJ" /&gt; India is Burma’s 4th largest trading partner after Thailand, the PRC and Singapore, and second largest export market after Thailand, absorbing 25 percent of its total exports.&lt;ref name="HJ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bilaterals.org/article.php3?id_article=9085 |title=Global Politician – India-Myanmar Trade Relations |publisher=Bilaterals.org |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; India is also the seventh most important source of Burma’s imports.

On 13 February 2001 India and Burma inaugurated a major 160 kilometre highway, called the Indo-Myanmar Friendship Road, built mainly by the [[Indian Army]]'s [[Border Roads Organisation]] and aimed to provide a major strategic and commercial transport route connecting [[North-East India]], and South Asia as a whole, to Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name="VJ" /&gt;

India and Myanmar have agreed to a four-lane, 3200&amp;nbsp;km triangular highway connecting India, Myanmar and Thailand. The route, which is expected to be completed by sometime during 2018, will run from India's northeastern states into Myanmar, where over 1,600&amp;nbsp;km of roads will be built or improved. The first phase connecting [[Guwahati]] to Mandalay is set to complete by 2016. This will eventually be extended to [[Cambodia]] and [[Vietnam]]. This is aimed at creating a new economic zone ranging from [[Kolkata]] on the Bay of Bengal to [[Ho Chi Minh City]] on the South China Sea.&lt;ref name="TH"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/india/9297354/India-to-open-super-highway-to-Burma-and-Thailand.html |title=Triangular Highway connecting India, Burma, Thailand |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Operation Leech ===
Operation ''Leech'' is the name given to an armed operation on the Indo-Burmese border in 1998. As the major player in South Asia, India always sought to promote democracy and install friendly governments in the region. To these ends, India's external [[intelligence agency]], [[R&amp;AW]], cultivated Burmese rebel groups and pro-democracy coalitions, especially the [[Kachin Independence Army]] (KIA).&lt;ref&gt;Larry Jagan, [[BBC]] Online, 4 July 2000&lt;/ref&gt; India allowed the KIA to carry a limited trade in [[jade]] and precious stones using Indian territory and even supplied them with weapons.

However, with increasing bonhomie between the Indian government and the Burmese junta, KIA becomes the main source of training and weapons for all northeastern rebel groups in India. R&amp;AW initiated Operation ''Leech'', with the help of [[Indian Army]] and paramilitary forces, to assassinate the leaders of the Burmese rebels as an example to other groups.&lt;ref&gt;Subir Bhaumik (June 2005).

==Bangladesh==
{{main article|Bangladesh–Burma relations}}
Historical relations between Burma and Bangladesh include centuries of trade, cultural interactions and migration between the kingdoms and empires of [[Bengal]] and the kingdoms of Burma, particularly [[Rakhine State|Arakan]]. Most prominently this is visible in the Indic Buddhist culture of Burma that was transmitted often through Bengal resulting in the imprint of Indian (inclusive of Bengali) culture and civilization currently found in Burma. The two nations also share a heritage of colonial commerce during the [[British Empire]]. The Bengali community in Burma is present in [[Rangoon]] and the Rakhine. In Bangladesh, a large population of Burmese ancestry resides in [[Chittagong]] and southeastern hill districts, including [[Rakhine people|Rakhines]] and [[Marma people|Bohmong]], as well as Burmese-Bengalis. After the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] in 1971, Burma became one of the first countries to recognise the independence of Bangladesh.

The presence of 270,000 [[Islam in Burma|Burmese Muslim]] refugees ([[Rohingya people]]) in southern Bangladesh have often caused irritants in bilateral relations, which are generally cordial. A 40-year maritime boundary dispute in the [[Bay of Bengal]] was resolved by the two countries at a UN tribunal in March 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2012/04/26/bangladesh-and-myanmar-resolve-longstanding-maritime-dispute/ |title=Bangladesh and Myanmar resolve longstanding maritime dispute |publisher=East Asia Forum |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bangladesh has sought transit rights through Burma, to establish connectivity with China and [[ASEAN]] through projects such as the proposed [[Chittagong]]-[[Mandalay]]-[[Kunming]] highway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ties with Myanmar can grow to new heights |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=239779 |newspaper=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]] |date=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The governments of both countries are also in discussions on the possible export of Burmese gas to Bangladesh, as well as setting up a joint hydroelectric power plant in [[Rakhine State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvb.no/news/bangladeshi-pm-in-push-for-gas-imports/18944 |title=Bangladeshi PM in push for Burma gas &amp;#124; Democratic Voice of Burma |publisher=Dvb.no |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The political class and civil society of Bangladesh often voiced support for Burma's pro-democracy struggle. In 2006 a petition by 500 Bangladeshi politicians and intellectuals, including [[Sheikh Hasina]] and [[Kamal Hossain]], expressed support for [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] and called for the release of all political prisoners in Burma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.secularvoiceofbangladesh.org/Aung_San_suu.htm |title=Aun San Suu Kyi |publisher=Secularvoiceofbangladesh.org |date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529154000/http://www.secularvoiceofbangladesh.org/Aung_San_suu.htm |archivedate=29 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; After winning elections in 2008, Sheikh Hasina reiterated her position on Burma's pro-democracy struggle, calling for an end to the detention of Suu Kyi and Burmese political prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bdnews24.com/details.php?id=121792&amp;cid=30 ]{{dead link|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Democratic Voice of Burma]] radio station operates bureaus in Dhaka and Chittagong.

Despite border (both territorial and nautical) tensions and the forced migration of 270,000 [[Rohingya people|Rohingya]] Muslims from [[Buddhist]] Burma in 1978, relations with [[Bangladesh]] have generally been cordial, albeit somewhat tense at times.

Many Rohingya refugees, not recognised as a sanctioned ethnic group and allegedly suffering abuse from the Burmese authorities,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7872635.stm What drives the Rohingya to sea?].

At the 2008 ASEAN Regional forum summit in Singapore, Bangladesh and Burma have pledged to solve their [[maritime boundary]] disputes as quickly as possible especially that a UN deadline in claiming maritime territories will expire in three years time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.irna.ir/en/news/view/menu-234/0807248083191800.htm Bangladesh, Burma pledge to resolve disputes over maritime borders] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619212401/http://www2.irna.ir/en/news/view/menu-234/0807248083191800.htm |date=19 June 2013 }}.

===History===
Theravada Buddhism was the link between Sri Lanka and Burma from the earliest times. There were frequent exchanges of pilgrims and scriptural knowledge with Ramanna (ancient name of the Burmese Kingdom). The resuscitation of the Sinhalese Sangha after the destructive effects of the Chola conquest owned a great deal to Bhikkus from upper Burma sent over for this purpose by the Burmese King at the request of Vijayabahu I.

{{disputed section|date=January 2013}}

By the 11th century these early religious times matured into diplomatic ties. Vijayabahu I (1055–1110 A.D.) who was engaged in a grim struggle against the Cholas received economic aid from King Anawarta of Burma. The alliance with the Burmese appears according to the chronicles to have continued after the expulsion of the Cholas and it was to Burma that Vijayabahu I turned for assistance in re-organizing the Sangha in Sri Lanka, thus underlining the connection between political ties and a common commitment to Buddhism.

The influence of Burmes architecture on Sri Lanka's religious building in Polonnaruwa is also evident. The Satmahalprasada, a setup with an unusual pyramid like form in several levels or storeys in Polonnnaruwa is the best example.

In 1865 the establishment of the Ramanna Nikaya is another major link. The Ramanna Nikaya lays greater stress on poverty and humility. This Nikaya aimed at returning to a purer form of Buddhism.

====History====
Since they both achieved independence in 1948, Burma and North Korea have enjoyed a chequered relationship.{{sfn|Selth|2004|p=1}} Burma expressed diplomatic support for the UN forces during the [[Korean War]],{{sfn|Selth|2004|p=2}} but after the signing of the 1953 armistice it established good working relations with the two Koreas. Consular links with both states were established in 1961 and full diplomatic relations followed in 1975.{{sfn|Selth|2004|p=4}} During the 1960s and 1970s, General [[Ne Win]]’s government made efforts to balance the competing demands of North Korea and [[South Korea]] for recognition, diplomatic support and trade. However, during the late 1970s the relationship with Pyongyang became slightly stronger than that with [[Seoul]], as Ne Win and the [[Burma Socialist Programme Party]] forged fraternal ties with [[Kim Il-sung]] and the [[Workers' Party of Korea]].{{sfn|Selth|2004|p=5}}{{efn|{{cn span|The Burma Socialist Programme Party’s policies favouring economic autarky were seen as being similar to Kim Il-sung’s [[juche]] (self-reliance) philosophy|date=September 2018}}}}

=====The assassination attempt in 1983=====
The bilateral relationship with North Korea dramatically collapsed in 1983, after Pyongyang allegedly sent three agents to Rangoon to assassinate South Korean President [[Chun Doo Hwan]], who was making a state visit to Burma. Due to a last minute, unannounced change to his schedule Chun survived [[Rangoon bombing|the massive bomb attack]] at the [[Martyrs' Mausoleum]], but 17 South Korean and four Burmese officials, including four Korean Cabinet ministers, were killed. Forty-six others were injured.&lt;ref&gt;The Bomb Attack at the Martyr’s Mausoleum in Rangoon: Report on the Findings by the Enquiry Committee and the Measures taken by the Burmese Government&lt;/ref&gt;

There was probably at least one bilateral agreement as early as 2000, but the relationship seemed to reach a major turning point around 2003. In July that year, it was reported that between 15 and 20 North Korean technicians were working at the Monkey Point naval base in Rangoon.&lt;ref&gt;‘North Koreans return to Burma’, Far Eastern Economic Review, 10 July 2003, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; A UN report released on February 1, 2018 cited North Korean ballistic missile transfers to the Myanmar army.&lt;ref&gt;AFP news Agency.

===Taiwan===
Although Burma [[Political status of Taiwan|officially recognises the PRC]] and not the [[Republic of China]], there is much other interaction between the two countries. Many Taiwanese nationals own businesses in Burma. There are direct air flights to [[Taipei]], as there are to some major cities in the People's Republic of China, including [[Kunming]], [[Guangzhou]] and Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mizzima.com/news/regional/2300-taiwan-burma-sign-trade-pact.html Taiwan, Burma sign trade pact] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530170040/http://mizzima.com/news/regional/2300-taiwan-burma-sign-trade-pact.html |date=30 May 2013 }}.

==United Nations==
In 1961, [[U Thant]], then Burma's Permanent Representative to the United Nations and former Secretary to the Prime Minister, was elected [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]]; he was the first non-Westerner to head any international organisation and would serve as UN Secretary-General for ten years.&lt;ref name="az"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=7610|author=Aung Zaw|title=Can Another Asian Fill U Thant's Shoes?|publisher=''[[The Irrawaddy]]'' September 2006|accessdate=12 September 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314141301/http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=7610|archivedate=14 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the Burmese to work at the UN when he was Secretary-General was the young [[Aung San Suu Kyi]].

Until 2005, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] annually adopted a detailed resolution about the situation in Burma by consensus.&lt;ref name = "UN-5483030"&gt;

In January 2007, Russia and China vetoed a draft resolution before the [[United Nations Security Council]]&lt;ref name="UN_S200714"&gt;{{UN document |docid=S-2007-14 |type=Document |body=Security Council |year=2007 |document_number=14 |accessdate=25 September 2007| date=12 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; calling on the government of Burma to respect human rights and begin a democratic transition. South Africa also voted against the resolution, arguing that since there were no peace and security concerns raised by its neighbours, the question did not belong in the Security Council when there were other more appropriate bodies to represent it, adding, "Ironically, should the Security Council adopt [this resolution] ... the [[Human Rights Council]] would not be able to address the situation in Myanmar while the Council remains seized with the matter."&lt;ref&gt;{{UN document |docid=S-PV-5619 |body=Security Council |type=Verbotim Report |meeting=5619 |page=3 |anchor=pg003-bk01 |date=12 January 2007 |meetingtime=16:00 |speakername=Mr. Kumalo | speakernation=South Africa |accessdate=25 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue had been forced onto the agenda against the votes of Russia and the China&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/burmese/highlights/story/2006/09/060918_unsc_agenda_burma.shtml |title=UN Security Council to include Burma in its agenda |publisher=BBC News|date=18 September 2006 |accessdate=17 November 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by the United States ([[United Nations Security Council veto power|veto power]] applies only to resolutions) claiming that the outflow from Burma of refugees, drugs, HIV-AIDS, and other diseases threatened international peace and security.&lt;ref&gt;{{UN document |docid=S-PV-5526 |body=Security Council |type=Verbotim Report |meeting=5526 |page=3 |anchor=pg003-bk02 |date=15 September 2006 |meetingtime=13:35 |speakername=Mr. Bolton | speakernation=United States |accessdate=25 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following September after the uprisings began and the human rights situation deteriorated, the Secretary-General dispatched his special envoy for the region, [[Ibrahim Gambari]], to meet with the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=23992|title=Ban Ki-moon dispatches Myanmar envoy to region as situation worsens|date=26 September 2007|publisher=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt; After seeing most parties involved, he returned to New York and briefed the Security Council about his visit.&lt;ref&gt;{{UN document |docid=S-PV-5753 |body=Security Council |type=Verbotim Report |meeting=5753 |page=3 |anchor=pg003-bk02 |date=5 October 2007 |meetingtime=10:00 |speakername=Mr. Gambari | speakernation=Special Envoy of the Secretary-General |accessdate=9 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During this meeting, the ambassador said that the country "indeed [has experienced] a daunting challenge. However, we have been able to restore stability. The situation has now returned to normalcy. Currently, people all over the country are holding peaceful rallies within the bounds of the law to welcome the successful conclusion of the national convention, which has laid down the fundamental principles for a [[New Burmese Constitution|new constitution]], and to demonstrate their aversion to recent provocative demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{UN document |docid=S-PV-5753 |body=Security Council |type=Verbotim Report |meeting=5753 |page=17 |anchor=pg017-bk02-pa04 |date=5 October 2007 |meetingtime=10:00 |speakername=Mr. Swe | speakernation=Myanmar |accessdate=9 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 October the Security Council met and issued a statement and reaffirmed its "strong and unwavering support for the Secretary-General's good offices mission", especially the work by Ibrahim Gambari&lt;ref name="UN_SPV5757"&gt;{{UN document |docid=S-PV-5757 |type=Verbatim Report |body=Security Council |meeting=5757 |accessdate=15 October 2007|date=11 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; (During a briefing to the Security Council in November, Gambari admitted that no timeframe had been set by the Government for any of the moves that he had been negotiating for.)&lt;ref&gt;{{UN document |docid=S-PV-5777 |body=Security Council |type=Verbotim Report |meeting=5777 |page=2 |anchor=pg002-bk08-pa10 |date=13 November 2007 |speakername=Mr. Gambari |accessdate=15 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout this period the [[United Nations World Food Programme in Burma|World Food Program]] has continued to organise shipments from the [[Mandalay Division]] to the famine-struck areas to the north.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=24086|title=Myanmar: UN to resume delivering food in Mandalay District|date=30 September 2007|publisher=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2008, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] voted for a resolution condemning Burma's human rights record; it was supported by 80 countries, with 25 voting against and 45 abstaining.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2008/12/26/2003432089/print UN General Assembly condemns Myanmar].

{{Politics of Turkey}}
In [[Turkey]], a '''Governor''' ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''Vali'') is an official responsible for the implementation of legislation, constitutional and government decisions in individual [[Provinces of Turkey|provinces]]. There are 81 Governors in Turkey,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/koseyazisi/121661/Yuh_Olsun__81_ilde_1_Kadin_Vali_.html|title=Cumhuriyet Gazetesi - Zeynep Oral: "Yuh Olsun: 81 İlde 1 Kadın Vali!"|date=21 September 2014|work=cumhuriyet.com.tr|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; one for each province, appointed ceremonially by the [[President of Turkey|President]] on the recommendation of the [[Ministry of the Interior (Turkey)|Interior Ministry]]. Governors are legally required to be politically neutral and have power over public offices within their Province, including the provincial police force. They also have a certain role in local government, though mayors and councillors are elected to these roles in [[Elections in Turkey|local elections]]. The Provincial head of security (the police force) also concurrently serves as Deputy Governor.

The ''[[Kaymakam]]'', (roughly translated as 'Sub-Governor') has similar functions and roles as the Governor but operates on a [[List of districts in Turkey|district]] level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palu.gov.tr/?sayfa=icerikler&amp;islem=oku&amp;no=5|title=Kaymakamın Görev ve Yetkileri - T.C. PALU KAYMAKAMLIĞI|work=palu.gov.tr|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governors by province==
{{Turkey governors}}
==Appointment==
The Governor is officially appointed (Turkish: ''atanma'') to his or her role by the [[President of Turkey]]. The [[Ministry of the Interior (Turkey)|Ministry of the Interior]] first presents their candidate for evaluation to the [[Cabinet of Turkey]], which reviews the suitability of the candidate before forwarding them for approval to the President. The President then formally appoints the candidate as the Governor of a province after a final period of evaluation.{{Citation needed|date = June 2015}}

===Term limits===
There are no set term limits for Governors, though they can be removed from their position at the will of the Interior Ministry. Governors can also be moved from province to province, meaning that it is not unusual for Governors to be appointed to a Province in which they have no prior experience or personal connection.{{Citation needed|date = June 2015}}

==Functions==
[[File:Özal.jpg|240px|thumbnail|right|[[Lale Aytaman]] ([[Muğla]]), the first of the only three female Governors to ever be appointed in the [[History of the Republic of Turkey|history of the Turkish Republic]], with former President [[Turgut Özal]] in 1991]]
Governors are mainly tasked with the implementation of government legislation and decisions, meaning that they are senior members of the [[Civil Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buyutec.net/159-valinin-gorevleri-nelerdir/|title=Valinin Görevleri Nelerdir ?|work=Buyutec.Net|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ceremonial===
During ceremonies or formal national holiday celebrations, the Governor of a province serves as the most senior state official during provincial events unless a national state official (such as the President) is in attendance. The Governor presides over the celebrations and formally accepts any awards presented during a ceremony.{{Citation needed|date = June 2015}}

===Civil service===
One of the most important functions of a Governor is to make sure decisions, constitutional requirements and new legislation are implemented within the province over which they preside. They are also tasked with the implementation of any demands of [[Ministries of Turkey|government ministries]]. In the event that legislation cannot be directly or practically implemented, the Governor is responsible for bringing about the conditions in which new legislation is compatible with their province.

The Governor's powers are decided by government legislation and have the right to issue a 'general command' to implement government decisions, legislation and constitutional requirements.{{Citation needed|date = June 2015}}

===Local government===
Governors have the right to both supervise and reorganise local government positions, which include district and metropolitan municipalities as well as municipal and provincial councillors. Although local elections are held every five years to elect mayors and councillors, the Governor (who is unelected) has the right to inspect the proceedings of local administrations as well as conduct any reorganisations that may be deemed necessary. Any legislative changes to local government (such as the [[2013 Turkish local government reorganisation|2013 local government reorganisation]]) are also implemented by the Governor.{{Citation needed|date = June 2015}}

===Command over public institutions===
The Governor has the right to preside over any matters of state that are not already covered by public institutions within a province, or any matters that do not have an assigned public official to deal with them. The Governor can also request public institutions or officials to perform tasks that are related to their aims and purpose if a public institution dealing with said tasks is not available in a province.

The Governor has the right to appoint and move some public officials from their positions, as well as provide them his or her own personal viewpoint on certain matters. The Governor, as mentioned above, can redetermine the remit and the positions of some public officials within a province.{{Citation needed|date = June 2015}}

===Provincial security===
The Governor is the highest level of provincial command of both the police forces and the [[Gendarmerie (Turkey)|Gendarmerie]]. The Deputy Governor concurrently serves as the head of provincial security, who in turn commands both the head of the provincial police force and the head of the provincial Gendarmerie (A [[Colonel]]). In order to maintain peace and security, a Governor has the right to take certain decisions intended to stop civil disobediences.{{Citation needed|date = June 2015}}

==Controversies==
Since Governors are appointed by the government, there have been concerns over whether Governors can truly be neutral. This is because they are appointed by a partisan government. Several politicians that have become government ministers, such as [[Efkan Ala]] and [[Vecdi Gönül]], have previously served as Governors of multiple provinces. Furthermore, Governors have been accused on numerous occasions of acting with bias in favour of the government. İzmir Mayor [[Aziz Kocaoğlu]] accused the Governor of İzmir of campaigning for the [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] during the [[Turkish local elections, 2014|2014 local elections]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haber7.com/ic-politika/haber/1128186-kocaoglundan-izmir-valisine-veryansin|title=Kocaoğlu'ndan İzmir Valisi'ne veryansın|date=30 September 2014|work=Haber7|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governors in [[Hakkari]] and [[Denizli]] were also accused of forcing public employees to attend President [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan|Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's]] controversial 'public opening' rallies before the [[Turkish general election, June 2015|June 2015 general election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taraf.com.tr/politika/bu-da-oldu-hakkari-valiliginden-akp-mitingine-katilmayanlara-tehdit/ |title=Bu da oldu…Hakkari Valiliği’nden AKP mitingine katılmayanlara tehdit! |author=Müjgan Yağmur |work=Taraf Gazetesi |accessdate=30 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150720044014/http://www.taraf.com.tr/politika/bu-da-oldu-hakkari-valiliginden-akp-mitingine-katilmayanlara-tehdit/ |archivedate=20 July 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the [[Peoples' Democratic Party (Turkey)|Peoples' Democratic Party]] issued a manifesto pledge to introduce elections for Governors, rather than appointing them through the Interior Ministry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sabah.com.tr/gundem/2015/04/21/hdp-secim-beyannamesi-metninin-tamami|title=HDP Seçim Beyannamesi metninin tamamı|date=21 April 2015|work=Sabah|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Central Governors==
Besides the 81 Provincial Governors, some Governors who have previously served in a province may be reassigned as a 'Central Governor' ''(Turkish: Merkez Valisi)''. This post does not carry with it any active responsibilities and is effectively a means of terminating a Governor's term without withdrawing their privileges or suspending their pay (though their wages are reduced in comparison to provincial governors). The 'centre' ''(merkez)'' refers to the [[Ministry of the Interior (Turkey)|Ministry of the Interior]], where a Central Governor is given a small office but have no role until they are reassigned to govern a province. Central Governors may visit the Interior Ministry whenever they wish. However, Central Governors may be given special tasks should the Interior Minister deem it necessary. Previously, it was possible for a Governor to legal contest their reassignment from a provincial to a central Governor in an attempt to remain in an active gubernatorial role, though this privilege has since been removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.milligazete.com.tr/haber/Merkez_valiligine_atanmak_ne_demek/335027#.VZLbIc7zaFI|title=Milli Gazete - Hak Geldi, Batıl Zail Oldu - Merkez valiliğine atanmak ne demek?|work=milligazete.com.tr|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are currently around 99 Central Governors, though this number changes frequently along with re-organisation decrees issued by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emlakkulisi.com/merkez-valisi-kimdir-kac-merkez-valisi-var/288678|title=Merkez Valisi kimdir, kaç Merkez Valisi var? 16-09-2014|work=emlakkulisi.com|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vezarate.kh.entrance.jpg|thumbnail|At the Iranian Foreign Ministry, in [[Tehran]], a banner advertising an article written by [[Ayatollah Khomeini]] in which he is quoted as saying that America is the Great Satan.]]
The '''Great Satan''' ({{lang-fa|شيطان بزرگ}}; ''Shaytân-e Bozorg'', ''Shaytân-e Kabir'') is a derogatory [[epithet]] for the [[United States|United States of America]] in some Iranian [[foreign policy]] statements. Occasionally, these words have also been used toward the government of the [[United Kingdom]].

The term was originally{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} used by Iranian leader [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] in his speech on November 5, 1979 to describe the United States, which he accused of [[imperialism]] and the sponsoring of corruption throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech

 | quote =  In this revolution, the Great Satan is America that gathers around other devils blatantly…If we see the US, this great Satan, raising chain and bringing the devils together around him, it is because the US grip over our country and our resources curtailed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The speech occurred one day after the onset of the [[Iran hostage crisis]].

[[Ayatollah Khomeini]] also occasionally used the term "[[Iblis]]" (the primary devil in Islam) to refer to the United States and other [[Western countries]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Background==
The post-[[Iranian Revolution|revolutionary]] government of Iran has regarded the United States and the United Kingdom as [[Imperialism|imperialist]] states, who have a long history of interfering in Iran's internal affairs. In 1907, an [[Anglo-Russian Entente|Anglo-Russian agreement]] between Russia and Britain divided Iran into spheres of influence, calling into question {{clarify|date=May 2016}}, although not terminating, Iran's [[sovereignty]].

He said that he thought that he should not stay here more than a few days, but would then go to Europe and he hoped eventually to America. He added he would be looking for work shortly as he has a large family and very small means outside of Iran. I tried to boost his morale by saying that I hoped that soon he would return to reign over his people for whom he had done so much, but he replied that Mosadeq was absolutely mad and insanely jealous, like a tiger who springs upon any living thing that it sees moving above him. Shah believes Mosadeq thinks he can form a partnership with the [Communist] Tudeh Party and then outwit it, but in so doing Mosadeq will become the Dr. [Edvard] Bene[š] of Iran.}}&lt;/ref&gt; After widespread rioting and with help from the [[CIA]] and British intelligence services, Mossadeq was defeated and the Shah returned to power, ensuring support for Western (chiefly British) oil interests and ending the perceived threat of communist expansion. General [[Fazlollah Zahedi]], who led the military coup, became prime minister.

[[File:TheGreatSatan a.gif|150px|thumbnail|The ''Great Satan'' by [[Carlos Latuff]]]]
Khomeini is quoted as saying on November 5, 1979, ''"[America is] the great Satan, the wounded snake."''&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Buck, Religious myths and visions of America: how minority faiths redefined America's world role, page 136 [https://books.google.com/books?id=E8Cd5sfApM4C&amp;pg=PA136]&lt;/ref&gt; The term was used extensively during and after the [[Islamic Revolution]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/jfq_pubs/1509.pdf Iran &amp; the Great Satan]&lt;/ref&gt; and it continues to be used in some Iranian political circles. Use of the term at rallies is often accompanied by shouts of "Marg bar Amrika!" ("Death to America"). It is used in academic journals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a727162072~db=all America's foreign policy: Manifest Destiny or Great Satan? - Contemporary Politics&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lesser Satan===
Khomeini called the [[Soviet Union]], the principal antagonist of the US during the [[Cold War]], the "'''Lesser Satan'''" because of its atheistic communist ideology, and he said that Iran should support neither side.&lt;ref name="katz2010"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Iran Primer: Power, Politics, and U.S. Policy |publisher=United States Institute of Peace |editor=Wright, Robin B. |pages=186 |chapter=Iran and Russia |author=Katz, Mark N. |year=2010 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MDgwl59s_hUC&amp;lpg=PA186&amp;ots=xy7W1akXVv&amp;pg=PA186#v=onepage&amp;f=false |isbn=978-1-60127-084-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Israel|State of Israel]] was condemned as the "[[Little Satan]]" in 1979 by Khomeini when he was addressing Israel's backing of the Shah, its close ties to the US, and the ongoing [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]]. Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] stated that "Israel is the little Satan" in a July 1980 interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jpost.com/Features/In-Thespotlight/This-Week-in-History-Ayatollah-Khomeini-returns-to-Iran | title=This Week in History: Ayatollah Khomeini returns to Iran - Features - Jerusalem Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
The term has been discussed extensively and addressed within the context of [[Iran–United States relations]] by some members of the United States foreign policy establishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/15/international/15POWE.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |title=With Candor, Powell Charms Global MTV Audience |first=Todd S. |last=Purdum |date=2002-02-15 |accessdate=2010-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109191825/http://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/15/international/15POWE.html |archivedate=November 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Heritage''' ({{lang-hy|Ժառանգություն}}, ''Zharangut’yun'') is an [[Armenia]]n [[National liberalism|national liberal]] [[political party|party]]. It was founded in 2002 by [[Raffi Hovannisian]], independent Armenia's first Foreign Minister.

==Policy and ideology==
*Support for [[Liberal democracy]]&lt;ref name="europeanintegration.am"&gt;{{cite web|title=RA Political Parties: Representation in Europe|url=http://www.europeanintegration.am/en/4246.html|publisher=European Integration NGO|accessdate=8 June 2014|location=Yerevan|quote=Armenian Heritage Party is an advocate of liberal economic and democratic governance system. Despite the party’s declared liberal-democrat ideology it is not a member of ELDR. However, Heritage party that is now in Armenian opposition is also represented in Europe: since recently the Heritage joined the European Democratic Party as an observer.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Economy
*[[Economic liberalism]]&lt;ref name="europeanintegration.am"/&gt;
*"Domestic policy goals are legal reforms, the development of civil society and the economic policy of Armenia. Heritage states that sustaining the competitiveness of the market helps the Armenian economy grow."&lt;ref name="europeanforum"/&gt;
*"Furthermore, the party believes that reducing poverty and building good social services are very important for the future of Armenia. By taking these measures, Heritage has the objective to reduce emigration from Armenia and stop the “brain drain” from the country."&lt;ref name="europeanforum"/&gt;

;Foreign Affairs
*"Their foreign policy can be characterised as balanced, but also as pro-Western. The Heritage party underlines the good relationship with Russia, China and India, but sees European integration and cooperation as the key to progress. European integration is not a goal on its own, but rather a tool for improved well-being, prosperity and security. With Turkey, Heritage advocates an open and honest dialogue."&lt;ref name="europeanforum"&gt;{{cite web|title=Armenia country update|url=http://www.europeanforum.net/country/armenia|publisher=European Forum for Democracy and Solidarity|archivedate=8 June 2014|date=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Recognition of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Republic]] as an independent state (the party has several times unsuccessfully proposed bills in the parliament that would formally recognize the NKR by the Republic of Armenia)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Karabakh recognition bill put into circulation at Armenian parliament|url=http://www.panarmenian.net/eng/news/121534/|accessdate=28 June 2013|date=4 September 2012|agency=[[PanARMENIAN.Net]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[European integration|Integration]] of Armenia into the [[European Union]] and ultimate [[Enlargement of the European Union|accession]]&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;
&lt;!--
*Ambiguous references to [[United Armenia]] (i.e. claiming parts of territories of Turkey, Azerbaijan and Georgia as historically Armenian)--&gt;

==Electoral record==
The party emerged as the fifth largest party in the [[National Assembly of Armenia]] after its debut in the [[Armenian parliamentary election, 2007|2007 Armenian parliamentary elections]].  It obtained 7 seats and a popular vote of 5.81%.

In [[Armenian parliamentary election, 2012|2012 parliamentary election]], Heritage won 5 seats by party-list with 86,998 votes.

The '''International Union of Air Pollution Prevention and Environmental Protection Associations''' ('''IUAPPA''') is an international federation of civil society organisations concerned with [[air pollution]]. IUAPPA, founded 1964 at the urging of the US Air Pollution Control Association,&lt;ref name="Wiley"&gt;Joachim Radkau: The Age of Ecology. Wiley, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; has 40 national organisations such as; the United States ([[Air and Waste Management Association]]), Germany ([[Verein Deutscher Ingenieure]]) and Japan (Japan Environmental Management Association for Industry) and has networks and representatives in most others countries. The Foundation is seen as one milestone in the "Ecological Revolution" in and around 1970.&lt;ref name="Wiley"/&gt;

==Focus==
The focus of IUAPPA is "the development and implementation of more effective policies for the prevention and control of air pollution, the protection of the environment and the adoption of sustainable development".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://iuappa.org/Statutes.html/ |title= Statutes IUAPPA|accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; IUAPPA wants to achieve the adoption and effective implementation of policies which can secure a clean and healthy atmospheric environment, together with scientists, policy-makers, regulators, business and citizen groups with this same objective.

{{LGBT rights}}

'''Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT)''' people in  '''Suriname''' may face legal challenges not experienced by non-[[LGBT]] residents. But both male and female same-sex sexual activity are legal in [[Suriname]]. Hate speech on the basis of sexual orientation is banned in the country, though no protections exist for employment and the provision of goods and services. [[Same-sex marriage]] and [[civil union]]s are not recognised by law. Nevertheless, Suriname is legally bound to the January 2018 [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]] ruling, which held that same-sex marriage is a human right protected by the [[American Convention on Human Rights]].&lt;ref name="IACHR"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://au.news.yahoo.com/world/a/38550305/inter-american-court-endorses-same-sex-marriage/|title=Inter-American Court endorses same-sex marriage|work=[[Agence France-Presse]]|publisher=[[Yahoo7]]|date=9 January 2018|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While homosexuality tends to be viewed as a taboo topic, the situation and attitudes have slowly changed in recent years.&lt;ref name="parea"/&gt;

==Legality of same-sex sexual activity==
Same-sex sexual activity has been legal in Suriname since 1869.&lt;ref name="US" /&gt; The age of consent for heterosexual intercourse is 16, while the age of consent for homosexual intercourse is 18.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ageofconsent.net/world/suriname What is the Suriname Age of Consent?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition of same-sex relationships==
[[Same-sex marriage]]s, [[civil union]]s or [[domestic partnership]]s are not recognised.

==Discrimination protections==
In March 2015, the Government introduced hate speech legislation which includes sexual orientation as a ground for non-discrimination complaints. Specifically, Articles 175, 175a and 176 of the Surinamese Penal Code were updated to include sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="Blue"&gt;[http://www.passblue.com/2016/12/13/suriname-should-do-the-right-thing-on-lgbt-rights-at-the-un/ Suriname Should Do the Right Thing on LGBT Rights at the UN]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ilga.org/downloads/Suriname__STAKEHOLDERS_REPORT.pdf Human Rights Situation for LGBTI Persons and Sexual Rights in the Republic of Suriname]&lt;/ref&gt; Violation of this law can result in a prison sentence of up to one year or a fine. Despite the protective legislation, the LGBT community continues to face discrimination from the Government and society. In 2014, the Government explicitly excluded LGBT people from a social security legislation. According to the [[United States Department of State]], some members of Parliament and the then-Vice President spoke out openly against LGBT persons, comparing homosexuality to a "disease" and inciting hatred and violence. Additionally, in 2015, there were reports of societal discrimination against the LGBT community in the areas of employment and housing.&lt;ref name="US"&gt;[https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/253255.pdf SURINAME 2015 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender identity and expression==
In January 2017, a judge granted a transgender woman the right to have her gender formally changed with the Central Bureau of Civil Affairs and ordered the registry to officially change her registration to reflect her amended status. The Association of Pentecostal Churches in Suriname (VVPES) and the Suriname Islamic Association (SIV), which had protested against and opposed the right to recognize a gender change, indicated they would "accept the verdict".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Transgender wins case for sex change recognition|url=https://thedailyherald.sx/regional/62860-transgender-wins-case-for-sex-change-recognition|accessdate=12 January 2017|publisher=''The Daily Herald''|date=12 January 2017|location=Philipsburg, Sint Maarten}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leeuwin |first1=Wilfred |title=Yvanna Hilton mag als vrouw door het leven |url=http://dwtonline.com/laatste-nieuws/2017/01/11/yvanna-hilton-mag-als-vrouw-door-het-leven/ |accessdate=12 January 2017 |publisher=''[[De Ware Tijd]]'' |date=11 January 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170112212427/http://dwtonline.com/laatste-nieuws/2017/01/11/yvanna-hilton-mag-als-vrouw-door-het-leven/ |archivedate=12 January 2017 |location=Paramaribo, Suriname |language=Dutch |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2017, the Central Bureau of Civil Affairs formally appealed the court ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Suriname appeals transgender verdict|url=https://www.thedailyherald.sx/regional/63426-suriname-appeals-transgender-verdict|website=www.thedailyherald.sx|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==
Suriname's first public gay rights march took place on 11 October 2011 ([[National Coming Out Day]], ''Nationale kom-uit-de-kastdag'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]) in [[Paramaribo]], following [[Ronny Asabina]]'s comments against homosexuality in June. Two members of the [[National Assembly (Suriname)|National Assembly]], including [[Harish Monorath]], attended the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.news24.com/World/News/Suriname-holds-first-gay-rights-march-20111012|title = Suriname holds first gay rights march|author = Reuters|publisher = News24|date = 2011-10-12&lt;!-- 12:27--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was partly organized by [[Suriname Men United]], the largest gay men's organization in the country.

Other LGBT groups include PAREA and the LGBT Platform Suriname. Both are active in raising awareness of LGBT people, organising seminars with the police force on recognizing anti-LGBT violence, and pressing for the legal recognition of same-sex couples.&lt;ref name="parea"&gt;[http://pareasuriname.com/gay-life-in-suriname/ Gay Life in Suriname]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/11/06/suriname-debates-equal-rights Suriname Debates Equal Rights]&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2016, Justice Minister [[Jennifer van Dijk-Silos]] organized several public hearings in collaboration with civil society in Suriname to discuss the expansion of the rights of LGBT people.&lt;ref name="Blue"/&gt;

==Public opinion==
A 2010 opinion poll carried out by [[Vanderbilt University]] showed that 20.3% of the Surinamese population supported same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vanderbilt.edu/lapop/insights/I0844.enrevised.pdf Support for Same‐Sex Marriage in Latin America]&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, [[PlanetRomeo]], an LGBT social network, published its first Gay Happiness Index (GHI). Gay men from over 120 countries were asked about how they feel about society’s view on homosexuality, how do they experience the way they are treated by other people and how satisfied are they with their lives. Suriname was ranked 46th with a GHI score of 48.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.planetromeo.com/en/lgbt/gay-happiness-index/ The Gay Happiness Index.

'''''Last Chance''''' (French: '''''Une derniere chance''''') is a 2012 documentary by [[Paul-Émile d'Entremont]] about five [[LGBT]] people seeking the [[right of asylum]] in Canada in order to escape persecution or [[homophobic violence]] in their homelands. Subjects in the film include a transgender woman who was institutionalized by her family in Lebanon, an LGBT person jailed in Egypt, as well as Trudi, a Jamaican lesbian who was "[[Corrective rape|correctively raped]]" at gunpoint. ''Last Chance'' was produced by the [[National Film Board of Canada]].&lt;ref name="Takeuchi"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.straight.com/article-849216/vancouver/nfb-documentary-follows-queer-refugees-seeking-last-chance-canada|title=NFB documentary follows queer refugees seeking Last Chance in Canada|last=Takeuchi|first=Craig|date=5 December 2012|work=[[Georgia Straight]]|accessdate=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Burnett"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.montrealgazette.com/2012/12/07/award-winning-doc-on-queer-refugees-fleeing-to-canada-screening-for-free-on-nfb-website/|title=Award-winning doc on queer refugees fleeing to Canada screening for free on NFB website|last=Burnett|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Burnett|date=7 December 2012|work=[[Montreal Gazette]]|accessdate=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chainney"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lapresse.ca/cinema/201212/03/01-4600321-une-derniere-chance-le-combat-des-demandeurs-dasile-gai.php|title=Une dernière chance: le combat des demandeurs d'asile gai|last=Chainney|first=Annik|date=3 December 2012|work=[[La Presse (Canada)]]|publisher=[[Canadian Press]]|language=French|accessdate=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

D'Entremont conceived the idea for the film while in Jordan, working on his previous film, ''Reema, aller-retour''. The film took ten years to make, including three years of [[principal photography]]. Trudi's was the last story to be filmed. Montreal immigration and refugee lawyer Noel St. Pierre was also among those interviewed in the film.&lt;ref name="Burnett"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2878">The '''Law Enforcement Intelligence Unit''' (LEIU) is an organization designed to facilitate intelligence sharing between state and local [[law enforcement agency|law enforcement agencies]].  It began in 1956 with 26 members and has since expanded to include roughly 250 members, mostly in the United States but also in Canada, Australia, and South Africa.  The organization is divided into four zones: Eastern, Central, Northwestern, and Southwestern.  According to its website, LEIU's purpose is to "gather, record, and exchange confidential information not available through regular police channels, concerning organized crime and terrorism."

Since the LEIU is not a government agency, it is not subject to the provisions of the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] or its equivalents in other countries.

In June 2003, the annual meeting of the LEIU in Seattle, Washington was protested by approximately 400 people, resulting in 12 arrests, and [[pepper spray]]ing of demonstrators.  "Among the activists' concerns" were "post-9/11 laws such as the USA Patriot Act, which gives the government expanded powers to use wiretaps, electronic surveillance and other methods of information gathering."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/local/124828_protest03.html Seattle protest turns ugly&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

This article lists incidents that have been termed [[ethnic cleansing]] by some academic or legal experts. Not all experts agree on every case, particularly since there are a variety of [[Ethnic cleansing#Definitions|definitions for the term ethnic cleansing]]. Where claims of ethnic cleansing originate from non-experts (e.g., journalists or politicians) this is noted.

==Ancient and Medieval periods==
* {{circa}} 149 BC: The [[Battle of Carthage (c. 149 BC)|Battle of Carthage]] was the main engagement of the [[Third Punic War]] between the [[Punic]] city of [[Carthage]] in Africa and the [[Roman Republic]]. It was a siege operation, starting sometime between 149 and 148 BC, and ending in spring 146 BC with the sack and complete destruction of the city of Carthage. In spring 146 BC, the Romans broke through the city wall, eventually after hours upon hours of house-to-house fighting, the Carthaginians surrendered.  An estimated 50,000 surviving inhabitants were sold into slavery. The city was then leveled.

*{{circa}} 1282 [[Sicilian Vespers]]  (Italian: Vespri siciliani; Sicilian: Vespiri siciliani) is the name given to the successful rebellion on the island of Sicily that broke out on the Easter of 1282 against the rule of the French/Capetian king [[Charles I of Naples|Charles I]], who had ruled the Kingdom of Sicily since 1266. Within six weeks, three thousand French men and women were slain by the rebels, and the government of King Charles lost control of the island. It was the beginning of the War of the Sicilian Vespers.
*{{circa}} 1250–1500 AD: From the [[History of the Jews in Europe|13th to the 16th centuries]] many European countries expelled the Jews from their territory on at least 15 occasions. Spain was preceded by England, France and some German states, among many others, and succeeded by at least five more expulsions.
*{{circa}} 1492–1614 AD: As a result of [[religious persecution]], up to a quarter million Jews in Spain converted to [[Catholicism]], those remaining (between 40,000 and 70,000) were expelled in 1492 following the [[Alhambra Decree]]. Shortly after the practice of Islam was outlawed and all of Spain's Muslims became nominally Christian.&lt;ref&gt;''A brief History of Ethnic Cleansing'', by Andrew Bell-Fialkoff, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; The descendants of these converted Muslims were called [[Moriscos]]. After the 1571 suppression of the [[Morisco Revolt]] in the  [[Alpujarras]] region, almost 80,000 Moriscos were relocated to other parts of Spain and some 270 villages and hamlets were repopulated with settlers brought from other regions. This was followed by a general [[Expulsion of the Moriscos]] between 1609–1614 which was nominally applied to the entire Spanish realm, but was carried out most thoroughly in the eastern region of Valencia. Although its overall success in terms of implementation is subject to academic debate and did not involve widespread violence, it is considered one of the first episodes of state-sponsored ethnic cleansing in the modern western world.

*Michael Mann, basing his figures on those provided by [[Justin McCarthy (American historian)|Justin McCarthy]], states that between 1821 and 1922, a large number of Muslims were expelled from [[Southeast Europe]] as [[Bulgaria]], [[Greece]] and [[Serbia]] gained their independence from the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Mann describes these events as "murderous ethnic cleansing on a stupendous scale not previously seen in Europe". These countries sought to expand their territory against the [[Ottoman Empire]], which culminated in the [[Balkan Wars]] of the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Mann, ''The dark side of democracy: explaining ethnic cleansing'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=KKGt7CMROmgC&amp;pg=PA112 pp. 112–4], Cambridge, 2005 "... figures are derive[d] from McCarthy (1995: I 91, 162–4, 339), who is often viewed as a scholar on the Turkish side of the debate.

He estimates that between 1812 and 1922 somewhere around 5½ million Muslims were driven out of Europe and 5 million more were killed or died of either disease or starvation while fleeing. ... In the final [[Balkan Wars]] of 1912–13 he estimates that 62 percent of all Muslims (27 percent dead, 35 percent refugees) disappeared from the lands conquered by Greece, Serbia, and Bulgaria.

| pages=In late 1988, the entire Azerbaijani population (including Muslim Kurds) – some 167000 people – was kicked out of the Armenian SSR. In the process, dozens of people died due to isolated Armenian attacks and adverse conditions. This population transfer was partially in response to Armenians being forced out of Azerbaijan, but it was also the last phase of the gradual homogenization of the republic under Soviet rule. The population transfer was the latest, and not so "gentle", episode of ethnic cleansing that increased Armenia's homogenization from 90 percent to 98 percent. Nationalists, in collaboration with the Armenian state authorities, were responsible for this exodus.

* On 5 and 6 September 1955 the [[Istanbul Pogrom]] or "Septembrianá"/"Σεπτεμβριανά", secretly backed by the Turkish government, was launched against the Greek population of [[Istanbul]]. The mob also attacked some Jewish and Armenian residents of the city.  The event contributed greatly to the gradual extinction of the Greek minority in the city and throughout the entire country, which numbered 100,000 in 1924 after the Turko-Greek population exchange treaty.

* In 1966, there was unrest in the northern part of [[Nigeria]] that led to the death of about 80,000 people. Those killed were originally from the South Eastern region of the country and this act was seen as an attack on the [[Igbo people]]. This led [[C. Odumegwu Ojukwu]], the military governor of the Eastern region, to declare that region a Sovereign state, [[Biafra]]. The [[Nigerian Civil War]] began on 6 July 1967, but ended in 1970 with the help of the United Kingdom and China. Although there is relative peace in Nigeria, today, there is still some religious unrest in the North being caused by the [[Boko Haram]] group.

* The [[Communism|Communist]] [[Khmer Rouge]] government in [[Cambodia]] disproportionately targeted ethnic minority groups, including ethnic [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]], [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] and [[Thai people|Thai]]s. In the late 1960s, an estimated 425,000 ethnic Chinese lived in Cambodia; by 1984, as a result of Khmer Rouge [[genocide]] and emigration, only about 61,400 Chinese remained in the country. The small Thai minority along the border was almost completely exterminated, only a few thousand managing to reach safety in Thailand. The [[Cham people|Cham]] Muslims suffered serious purges with as much as 80% of their population exterminated. The Khmer's racial supremacist ideology was responsible to this ethnic purge.

'''Local purchasing''' is a preference to buy locally produced goods and services over those produced farther away. It is very often abbreviated as a positive goal, "buy local", that parallels the phrase "[[think globally, act locally]]", common in [[green politics]].

On the national level, the equivalent of local purchasing is [[import substitution]], the deliberate [[industrial policy]] or [[agricultural policy]] of replacing goods or services produced on the far side of a national border with those produced on the near side, i.e., in the same country or [[trade bloc]].

Historically, there have been so many incentives to buy locally that no one had to make any kind of point to do so, but with current market conditions, it is often cheaper to buy distantly produced goods, despite the added costs in terms of [[packaging]], [[transport]], [[inspection]], [[retail]] facilities, etc. As such, one must now often take explicit action if one wants to purchase locally produced goods.

These market conditions are based on externalized costs, argues local economy advocates. Examples of externalized costs include the price of war, [[asthma]]{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}, or [[climate change]], which are not typically included in the cost of a gallon of fuel, for instance. Most advocates for local economics address contracting and investment, as well as purchasing.

Agricultural alternatives are being sought, and have manifested themselves in the form of [[farmers' market]]s, farmed goods sold through the community [[cooperatives]], [[Urban agriculture|urban gardens]], and even school programs that endorse [[community agriculture]].

==Rationale for local purchasing==
Advocates often suggest local purchasing as a form of [[moral purchasing]]. Local purchasing is often claimed to be better for the [[Natural environment|environment]] and better for [[working conditions]]. Others contend (with  empirical evidence) that local purchasing and contracting enhances local job creation and wealth while strengthening community cohesiveness.&lt;ref name="The Benefits of Doing Business Locally"&gt;[http://www.amiba.net/home/benefits-local-business "The Benefits of Doing Business Locally"] by Jeff Milchen&lt;/ref&gt;

The first potential moral benefit is environmental: Bringing goods from afar generally requires [[energy consumption|using more energy]] than transporting goods locally, and some environmental advocates see this as a serious environmental threat. Transportation contributes to environmental contamination in addition to the pollution caused by chemical inputs in the growing phase. Of course, locally produced goods are not always more [[efficient energy use|energy-efficient]]; local [[agriculture]] or [[manufacturing]] may rely on heavy inputs (e.g., [[industrial agriculture]]) or energy-inefficient machinery and/or transportation systems. However, small-scale growers tend to be more environmentally friendly because industrial-sized agriculture uses genetically modified crops, monoculture production, and [[chemical fertilizer]]-intensive processes to grow crops—practices that local farmers typically avoid.&lt;ref name="Society 2010"&gt;''Environment and Society: A Critical Introduction'' (Critical Introductions to Geography) by Paul Robbins, John Hintz, and Sarah A. Moore, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second potential benefit is creating better working conditions. Nonetheless, while diverting purchasing from developing countries to local farmers helps build the local economy, it can lead to worse conditions for poor farmers in developing countries because it removes potential buyers from the market.

For communities, spending at local independent businesses also generates more jobs and wealth in the local economy compared to spending at absentee-owned businesses, including corporate chains.&lt;ref name="localmultiplier"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amiba.net/resources/multiplier-effect|title=The Multiplier Effect of Local Independent Businesses - AMIBA|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of localisation is to reduce unnecessary transport, support entrepreneurism and to strengthen and diversify community economies.&lt;ref&gt;Bringing the Food Economy Home: Local Alternatives to Global Agribusiness, by Helena Norberg-Hodge, Todd Merrifield, and Steven Gorelick, 2002, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; This calls for condensation of agriculture and supports the idea that local farmers are capable of sustaining a community.

The term “Buy Local” has become subject to varying interpretations. While leading advocates of local independent business such as the [[American Independent Business Alliance]] say the term should apply only to locally owned independent businesses, some campaigns run by governments and Chambers of Commerce consider "local" to be merely a geographic consideration.&lt;ref name="amiba"&gt;[http://www.amiba.net/about_ibas "What is a Local Independent Business] by American Independent Business Alliance&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, many corporations have manipulated the term in ways critics call "local-washing".&lt;ref name="newrules"&gt;[http://www.newrules.org/retail/article/corporate-coopt-local "The Corporate Co-opt of Local"] article by Stacy Mitchell&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative viewpoints ==
The argument that "buying local" is good for the economy is questioned by many economic theorists. They argue that transportation costs actually account for a fraction of overall production prices, and that choosing less efficient local products over more efficient nonlocal products is an economic [[deadweight loss]]. Moreover, the community as a whole does not actually save money because consumers have to spend so much more on the more expensive local products.&lt;ref name="buylocalcanbebadeconomics"&gt;[http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2009/04/06/buy_local_economics/ "'Buy Local' Can Be Bad Economics"] by Louis Johnston on MPR News&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly the [[moral purchasing]] argument has been questioned as more and more consumers consider the welfare of people in countries other than their own. Most "buy local" campaigns rely on the [[implicit assumption]] that providing jobs for people in the consumers' own country is more moral than in "foreign" countries. They also imply that money going to foreign countries is worse than money staying in the consumers' own country. Increasingly, these campaigns have been called out as paranoid, jingoist and even xenophobic.
 
Additionally, organic [[local food]] tends to be more costly so this is not an appealing option to consumers who are shopping on a budget. Small-scale farmers do not receive government subsidies and are not able to support their business on prices comparable to those of industrial-scale food production, so they must sell at higher prices to make a living.&lt;ref name="Society 2010"/&gt; Therefore, in order for the appeal of the local agriculture movement to overcome the economic cost, people must be willing to invest in it, which is unlikely when apparently similar products are available in grocery stores for a lower cost. Despite this, distribution costs of expansive food trade must also be factored in; with increasing gas prices, it becomes more expensive to ship food from outside sources.

==Import substituting==
{{main|Local ownership import substituting}}
In 2006, Michael Shuman proposed [[Local ownership import substituting]] (LOIS), as an alternative to [[neoliberalism]]. It rejects the idelogy of [[there is no alternative]].&lt;ref&gt;Shuman, M. H. (2006). ''The small-mart revolution: how local businesses are beating the global competition''. San Francisco, CA: Berrett-Koehler.&lt;/ref&gt; Shuman claims LOIS businesses are long term [[wealth]] generators, are less likely to [[exit strategy|exit]] destructively and have higher [[multiplier (economics)|economic multipliers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treehugger.com/culture/cage-match-tina-vs-lois.html|title=Cage Match: TINA vs LOIS|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5469">The '''Meyerhoff Scholarship Program''' was founded at the [[University of Maryland, Baltimore County]] (UMBC) in 1988 with a grant from the [[Robert E. Meyerhoff|Robert and Jane Meyerhoff Foundation]], under the guidance of future UMBC President [[Freeman A. Hrabowski III]].  It is focused on [[minority group|minority]] [[scholarship]] and awareness in the [[science]], [[technology]], [[engineering]] and [[math]] ([[STEM fields|STEM]]) disciplines.  The program has served as a model for fostering scholarship in the [[African American]] community.

==History==

Female students of African American descent were admitted to the program as of its second year, and the program was opened up as a general [[scholarship]] with an emphasis on minority interests in 1997.  This was widely viewed as preemptive action in response to the outcome of protracted litigation levied at the [[Benjamin Banneker Scholarship Program]], the first scholarship of its kind to be ruled unconstitutional&lt;ref&gt;http://www.diamondbackonline.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2005/02/24/421d6eee26596&lt;/ref&gt; (though the [[University of Maryland, College Park]] did publicly contest the issue vigorously for years).

==Publications and Media Coverage==
=== Overcoming the Odds ===
Two books chronicle the experiences and results of those affiliated with the program in its formative years.  The first was written in the late 1990s with an emphasis on [[African American]] males with its companion volume on African American females published in the early 2000s.

The '''Myanmar Language Commission''' ({{lang-my|မြန်မာစာအဖွဲ့}}; formerly '''Burmese Language Commission'''; abbreviated '''MLC''') is the pre-eminent government body on matters pertaining to the [[Burmese language]].&lt;ref&gt;E. Ulrich Kratz Southeast Asian Languages and Literatures: A Bibliographic Guide to Burmese, Cambodian, Indonesian, Javanese, Malay, Minangkakau, Thai, and Vietnamese 1996 Page 61 "The most important centre of language study in Burma is the Burma Language Commission (Myan-ma-za Aphweh;"&lt;/ref&gt; It is responsible for several projects including the [[Myanmar–English Dictionary]] (1993) and [[MLC Transcription System]] for [[Romanization of Burmese]].

==Establishment==

MLC's predecessor, the '''Literary and Translation Commission''' ({{my|ဘာသာပြန်နှင့် စာပေပြုစုရေး ကော်မရှင်}}), was set up by the [[Union Revolutionary Council]] in August 1963, tasked with publishing an official standard Burmese dictionary, Burmese speller, manual on Burmese composition, compilation of Burmese lexicon, terminology, and translation, compilation and publication of textbooks, reference books, and periodicals for educational use.&lt;ref name="allott"&gt;{{cite book|last=Allott|first=Anna J.|title=Prose Writing and Publishing in Burma: Government Policy and Popular Practice|editor=Seong Chee Tham|publisher=NUS Press|date=1981|series=Essays on Literature and Society in Southeast Asia: Political and Sociological Perspectives|isbn=9789971690366}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The commission was re-established as the Burmese Language Commission (BLC) on 15 September 1971.&lt;ref name="watkins"&gt;{{cite book|last=Watkins|first=Justin|title=Studies in Burmese Linguistics|publisher=Australian National University|date=2007|isbn=9780858835597}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Strategic and Critical Minerals Production Act of 2013''' ({{USBill|113|H.R.|761}}) is a bill that was introduced into the [[United States House of Representatives]] during the [[113th United States Congress]].  The bill would alter the rules and regulations surrounding getting permits/permission to undertake mining projects in the United States.  The bill would also alter that legal framework associated with this type of mining.

==Provisions of the bill==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Research Service]], a [[public domain]] source.''&lt;ref name=761sum&gt;{{cite web |title=H.R. 761 – Summary |url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/761 |publisher=United States Congress |accessdate=July 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Strategic and Critical Minerals Production Act of 2013 would deem a domestic mine that will provide strategic and [[critical mineral raw materials|critical mineral]]s to be an "infrastructure project" as described in the Presidential Order "Improving Performance of Federal Permitting and Review of Infrastructure Projects" dated March 22, 2012.&lt;ref name="761sum" /&gt;

The bill would set forth the responsibilities of the lead agency (federal, state, local, tribal, or Alaska Native Corporation) with responsibility for issuing a mineral exploration or mine permit with respect to project coordination, agency consultation, project proponents, contractors, and the status and scope of any environmental impact statement.&lt;ref name="761sum" /&gt;  It would require that lead agency to determine that any such action would not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment within the meaning of the [[National Environmental Policy Act]] of 1969 (NEPA) if the procedural and substantive safeguards of the lead agency's permitting process alone, any applicable state permitting process alone, or a combination of the two processes together provide an adequate mechanism to ensure that environmental factors are taken into account.&lt;ref name="761sum" /&gt;

The bill would require the lead agency's project lead, at a project proponent's request, to enter into an agreement with the project proponent and other cooperating agencies that sets time limits for each part of the permit review process.&lt;ref name="761sum" /&gt;

The bill would make these new rules retroactive by request, by applying the new rules to a mineral exploration or mine permit for which an application was submitted before enactment of H.R. 761 (if enacted) if the applicant so requests in writing. It then requires the lead agency to begin implementing the National Strategic and Critical Minerals Production Act of 2013 with respect to such application within 30 days after receiving such a request.&lt;ref name="761sum" /&gt;

The bill would require the lead agency, with respect to strategic and critical materials within a federally administered unit of the [[United States National Forest|National Forest System]], to: (1) exempt from federal regulations governing Special Areas all areas of identified mineral resources in [[Land Use Designations]] (other than [[Non-Development Land Use Designations]]); (2) apply such exemption to all additional routes and areas that the agency finds necessary to facilitate the construction, operation, maintenance, and restoration of the areas of the identified mineral resources; and (3) continue to apply such exemptions after approval of the Minerals Plan of Operations for the unit.&lt;ref name="761sum" /&gt;

The bill then declares that the priority of the lead agency is to maximize mineral resource development while mitigating environmental impacts, so that more of the mineral resource can be brought to the market place.&lt;ref name="761sum" /&gt;

The bill prescribes the [[Federal Register]] notice process for mineral exploration and mining projects.&lt;ref name="761sum" /&gt;

The National Strategic and Critical Minerals Production Act of 2013 would authorize the holder of a mineral exploration or mine permit to intervene as of right in any covered civil action by a person affecting rights or obligations of the permit holder under the permit.&lt;ref name="761sum" /&gt;  It also bars a civil action claiming legal wrong caused by an agency action unless it is filed by the end of the 60-day period beginning on the date of the final federal agency action to which it relates.&lt;ref name="761sum" /&gt;  It would require the court to hear and determine any covered civil action as expeditiously as possible.&lt;ref name="761sum" /&gt;  It prohibits the court, in a covered civil action, from granting or approving prospective relief unless it finds that such relief is narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of a legal requirement, and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct such violation.&lt;ref name="761sum" /&gt;  It declares inapplicable to such a civil action specified requirements of the Equal Access to Justice Act relating to award of costs and fees to a prevailing plaintiff.&lt;ref name="761sum" /&gt;  Finally, the bill would prohibit payment from the federal government for court costs of a party in such a civil action, including [[Attorney's fee|attorneys’ fees]] and expenses.&lt;ref name="761sum" /&gt;

==Congressional Budget office report==
{{cbo summary}}&lt;ref name=cbo761&gt;{{cite web |title=CBO – H.R. 761 |url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/44349 |publisher=Congressional Budget Office |accessdate=July 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing H.R. 761 would have no significant impact on the federal budget. Enacting the bill could reduce mandatory payments for attorneys’ fees over the 2014–2023 period; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures apply. However, the CBO estimates that any such effects would be minimal. Enacting the bill would not affect revenues.&lt;ref name="cbo761" /&gt;

The bill would require the [[Bureau of Land Management]] (BLM) and the [[United States Forest Service]] to take certain actions aimed at streamlining the process for obtaining permits to extract minerals from federal lands.&lt;ref name="cbo761" /&gt; Based on information from the affected agencies, CBO estimates that the streamlining provisions would have no significant budgetary effect because those agencies are performing most of those activities under current law. The bill also would direct the agencies to expedite the publishing of notices in the ''[[Federal Register]]'' related to [[mineral exploration]] and mining projects. Based on information provided by the BLM, the CBO estimates that implementing that provision would cost less than $300,000 a year, assuming availability of appropriated funds. Those funds would be used to hire additional employees to allow the affected agencies to meet the timelines established in the bill.&lt;ref name="cbo761" /&gt;

Finally, H.R. 761 would exempt lawsuits that affect mineral exploration or mining permits on federal lands from the [[Equal Access to Justice Act]]. That act requires the U.S. Treasury to pay the [[Attorney's fee|attorneys’ fees]] for certain plaintiffs who prevail in court proceedings against the federal government.&lt;ref name="cbo761" /&gt; Over the 2003–2012 period, total payments made on behalf of the BLM and the Forest Service from the [[Judgment Fund of the U.S. Treasury]] to cover attorneys’ fees under that act averaged about $1 million a year.&lt;ref name="cbo761" /&gt; Based on information from the [[Government Accountability Office]], the Treasury Department, and the affected land management agencies, the CBO estimates that only a small portion of that amount was paid to plaintiffs who prevailed in cases that affected mineral exploration or mining permits. The CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 761 would reduce direct spending by less than $50,000 a year over the 2014–2023 period.&lt;ref name="cbo761" /&gt;

H.R. 761 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the [[Unfunded mandate#Unfunded Mandates Reform Act|Unfunded Mandates Reform Act]] and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal governments.&lt;ref name="cbo761" /&gt;

==Procedural history==
===House===
The National Strategic and Critical Minerals Production Act of 2013 was introduced into the House on February 15, 2013 by [[Mark Amodei|Rep. Mark Amodei (R-NV)]].&lt;ref name=761allCongactions&gt;{{cite web |title=H.R. 761 – All Congressional Actions |url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d113:H.R.761:@@@X |publisher=Library of Congress |accessdate=July 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was referred to both the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary]] and the [[United States House Committee on Natural Resources]].&lt;ref name="761allCongactions" /&gt;  On March 1, 2013, the bill was referred to the [[United States House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources]], which held a hearing about the bill on March 21, 2013, before finally discharging the bill back to the main Committee on May 15.&lt;ref name="761allCongactions" /&gt;  The full House Natural Resources Committee held a markup session about the bill on May 15, 2013 and then ordered the bill to be Reported (Amended) by the Yeas and Nays: 24 – 17.&lt;ref name="761allCongactions" /&gt;  The House Judiciary Committee referred the National Strategic and Critical Minerals Production Act of 2013 to the [[United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law]] on April 8, 2013.  On July 8, 2013, the bill was discharged by the Judiciary Committee, reported (amended) by the House Natural Resources Committee (alongside [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-113hrpt138/pdf/CRPT-113hrpt138-pt1.pdf House Report 113-138 pt 1]), and placed on Union Calendar 100.&lt;ref name="761allCongactions" /&gt;  The House Majority Leader [[Eric Cantor]] placed the bill on the House Schedule on September 13, 2013 for consideration under a suspension of the rules on September 17.&lt;ref name=leadersschedule&gt;{{cite web |title=Leader's Weekly Schedule – Week of September 16, 2013 |url=http://majorityleader.gov/floor/9-16-13.pdf |publisher=House Majority Leader's Office |accessdate=September 16, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130930194454/http://majorityleader.gov/floor/9-16-13.pdf |archivedate=September 30, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=peteSept13&gt;{{cite news |last=Kasperowicz |first=Pete |title=A closer look at next week...

==Debate and discussion==
According to the [[National Journal]], the National Strategic and Critical Minerals Production Act of 2013 appeals to conservatives because it should streamline the process for mining on federal land and because the changes it makes will not cost the government additional money.&lt;ref name=NJjuly4&gt;{{cite news |last=Catalini |first=Michael |title=3 Ways the House Will Keep Busy (While Not Moving Immigration) |url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/congress/3-ways-the-house-will-keep-busy-while-not-moving-immigration-20130704 |accessdate=July 9, 2013 |newspaper=The National Journal |date=July 4, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130706001131/http://www.nationaljournal.com/congress/3-ways-the-house-will-keep-busy-while-not-moving-immigration-20130704 |archivedate=July 6, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Patagonia Area Resource Alliance asked its supporters to oppose the bill, due to their belief that the bill fails to protect the public interest.&lt;ref name=PARAoppose&gt;{{cite web |title=Oppose: National Strategic and Critical Minerals Production Act |url=http://www.patagoniaalliance.org/oppose-national-strategic-and-critical-minerals-production-act/ |publisher=Patagonia Area Resource Alliance |accessdate=July 9, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130710025519/http://www.patagoniaalliance.org/oppose-national-strategic-and-critical-minerals-production-act/ |archivedate=July 10, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The organization argues that (1) most mining is being done by foreign companies, who will not be paying appropriate royalties to the federal government under the new law; (2) that an old mining law – the [[General Mining Act of 1872]] – should be rewritten instead; and (3) that the National Strategic and Critical Minerals Production Act of 2013 would place too many restrictions on legal actions that could be taken against federal agencies when they fail to do their jobs properly, by adding time limits for actions and limits on damages.&lt;ref name="PARAoppose" /&gt;

'''OGPL''' (The '''Open Government Platform''') is a joint product from [[India]] and the [[United States]] to promote [[government transparency]] and greater citizen engagement by making more government data, documents, tools and processes publicly available. OGPL will be available, as an [[open source]] platform. The OGPL combines and expands the best features of the India's "India.gov.in" and the U.S. "Data.gov" sites.By making this available in useful machine-readable formats it allows developers, analysts, media &amp; academia to develop new applications and insights that will help give citizens more information for better decisions.

==Chair==

This initiative has been chaired on the Indian side by [[Sam Pitroda]], Adviser to Prime Minister on Public Information Infrastructure and Innovations and on the US side by [[Aneesh Chopra]], former Chief Technology Officer to President Obama.

==Purpose==
The purpose of the platform is to enhance access and use of government data to foster innovation.

In using an open source method of development, the OGPL community will provide future technology enhancements, open government solutions, and community-based technical support. OGPL has become an example of a new era of diplomatic collaborations that benefit the global community that promote government transparency, citizen-focused applications, and enrich humanity.

==Features of OGPL==

Initially, OGPL will provide governments the ability to
* Publish government data, documents, apps, tools, and services from multiple departments within a government
* Utilize [[web 2.0]] open-source technologies to develop low-cost, cloud-based infrastructure

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7867">'''Options for Change''' was a restructuring of the [[British Armed Forces]] in 1990 after the end of the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref name=hansard&gt;{{cite hansard |title=Defence (Options for Change) |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm198990/cmhansrd/1990-07-25/Debate-1.html |house=House of Commons |date=25 July 1990 |column_start=468 |column_end=486}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until this point, UK military strategy had been almost entirely focused on defending [[Western Europe]] against the [[Soviet Armed Forces]], with the [[Royal Marines]] in [[Scandinavia]], the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) in [[West Germany]] and over the [[North Sea]], the [[Royal Navy]] in the [[Norwegian Sea]] and [[North Atlantic]], and the [[BAOR#1945–1994|British Army in Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Freedman |first=Lawrence |date=18 August 1999 |title=The Politics of British Defence, 1979&amp;ndash;97 |publisher=Macmillan Press |isbn=0-333746-67-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse of the Soviet Union]] and the [[Warsaw Pact]] in 1989, a Soviet invasion of Western Europe no longer seemed likely. While the restructuring was criticised by several British politicians, it was an exercise mirrored by governments in almost every major Western military power: the so-called [[peace dividend]].&lt;ref name="ClementsSchiff1999"&gt;{{cite book|first1= Benedict J.|last1= Clements|first2=Jerald Alan |last2=Schiff|first3=Peter| last3=Debaere|first4= Hamid Reza |last4=Davoodi|title=Military Spending, the Peace Dividend, and Fiscal Adjustment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dz5nWM7M2TIC&amp;pg=PA3|date=1 July 1999|publisher=[[International Monetary Fund]]|isbn=978-1-4518-9700-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Total manpower was cut by approximately 18 per cent to around 255,000 (120,000 army; 60,000 navy; 75,000 air force).&lt;ref name=hansard /&gt;

Other casualties of the restructuring were the UK's nuclear civil defence organisations, the [[UKWMO|United Kingdom Warning and Monitoring Organisation]], and its field force, the [[Royal Observer Corps]] (a part-time volunteer branch of the RAF), both disbanded between September 1991 and December 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12056017.End_of_the_long_lookout/ |title=End of the Long Lookout |date=29 December 1995 |newspaper=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] |location=Glasgow |accessdate=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*A small reduction in [[Hawker Siddeley Nimrod|Nimrod]] maritime patrol aircraft.

==Royal Navy==
*Cutting the number of [[frigate]]s and [[destroyer]]s from around 50 to 40.

==On television==
A dramatisation of the effects that Options for Change had on the ordinary men and women serving in the armed forces came in the [[ITV Network|ITV]] series ''[[Soldier Soldier]]''. The fictional infantry regiment portrayed in the series, the King's Fusiliers, was one of those selected for amalgamation. It showed the whole process of negotiation over traditions, embellishments, etc. between the two regiments involved, and the uncertainty that many of those serving felt for their jobs in the light of two separate battalions merging into one, with the resulting loss of manpower.

[[File:Otpor.png|right|150px|thumb|Otpor! logo]]
'''Otpor!''' ({{lang-sr-Cyrl|Отпор!}}, {{lang-en|Resistance!}}) was a political organization in [[Republic of Serbia (1990–2006)|Serbia]] (then part of [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|FR Yugoslavia]]) from 1998 until 2004.

In its initial period from 1998 to 2000, Otpor! began as a civic protest group, eventually turning into a movement, which adopted the ''Narodni pokret'' (the People's Movement) title, against the policies of the [[Government of Serbia|Serbian authorities]] that were under the influence of [[Slobodan Milošević]] who at the time was [[President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|President of Serbia and Montenegro]]. Following [[overthrow of Slobodan Milošević|Milošević's overthrow]] in October 2000, Otpor! became a political watchdog organization monitoring the activities of the post-Milošević period of the [[Democratic Opposition of Serbia|DOS]] coalition. Finally, during fall 2003, Otpor! briefly became a political party which soon folded due to its failure to pass the 5% threshold needed get any seats in the Serbian parliament.

Founded and best known as an organization employing [[Nonviolent resistance|nonviolent struggle]] as a course of action against the Milošević-controlled Serbian authorities, Otpor! grew into a civic youth movement whose activity culminated on 5 October 2000 with Milošević's overthrow. In the course of a two-year nonviolent struggle against Milošević, Otpor! spread across Serbia, attracting in its heyday more than 70,000 supporters who were credited for their role in the 5 October overthrow.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cddrl.stanford.edu/news/cddrl_visiting_scholar_olena_nikolayenko_analyzes_postsoviet_youth_movements_20090619]; "The Rise Of Youth Movements In The Post Communist Region", Olena Nikolayenko, Center For Democracy Development, Stanford,19 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

After the overthrow, Otpor! launched campaigns to hold the [[Cabinet of Serbia (2001–04)|new government]] accountable, pressing for democratic reforms and fighting corruption, as well as insisting on cooperation with the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|International Criminal Tribunal]] (ICTY) at the Hague.&lt;ref&gt;[http://resistancestudies.org/?cat=16]; "Resistance studies - University of Goetheborgh" November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after the 2003 elections, Otpor! merged into the [[Democratic Party (Serbia)|Democratic Party]] (DS).

==Initial activity==
[[File:Otpor! recruiting flyer.jpg|right|250px|thumb|An Otpor! membership signup recruitment slip from the movement's early days.]]
Otpor! was formed in [[Belgrade]] on 10 October 1998 in response to a controversial piece of legislation in Serbia — the university law — introduced earlier that year by the [[Government of Serbia|Serbian government]] under Prime Minister [[Mirko Marjanović]]. Also, days before Otpor! got announced, the government introduced a [[decree]] (uredba) outlining special measures in the wake of the ongoing [[NATO]] bombing threat. Citing the decree, on 14 October 1998, the government's Ministry of Information headed by [[Aleksandar Vučić]] banned the publishing of ''[[Dnevni telegraf]]'', ''[[Danas (newspaper)|Danas]]'', and ''[[Naša borba]]'', three Belgrade dailies which were critical of the government to varying degrees.

The newly formed group named Otpor! mostly consisted of the [[Democratic Youth (Serbia)|Demokratska omladina]] ([[Democratic Party (Serbia)|Democratic Party]]'s youth wing) members, activists of the various [[NGO]]s that operated in Serbia, and students from the two [[public university|public universities]] in Belgrade — [[University of Belgrade]] and [[University of Arts in Belgrade|University of Arts]]. It quickly grew from a small group into a network of similarly politically minded young people, many of whom were already veterans of anti-Milošević demonstrations such as the [[1996–1997 protests in Serbia|1996-97 protests]] and the [[March 9, 1991 protest|9 March 1991 protest]]. With the political opposition in Serbia in disarray, Otpor! decided to build a broad political movement rather than a traditional NGO or political party. Frustrated with opposition leaders protecting their narrow personal and party interests, which often degenerated into infighting, the group also decided that "it would have [[Leaderless resistance|no leaders]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peoplebuildingpeace.org/thestories/article.php?id=136&amp;typ=theme&amp;pid=31 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309080603/http://www.peoplebuildingpeace.org/thestories/article.php?id=136&amp;typ=theme&amp;pid=31 |archivedate=9 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}; "Rage Against The Machine - Milja Jovanovic, People Building Peace", vol 2 European Centre for Conflict Prevention 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Early on, Otpor! defined its objectives and methods, including an account of what it saw as the main problems of the country, in the "Declaration of the Future of Serbia." The declaration was signed and supported by all prominent student organizations in Serbia. An advisory body was set up and its members became the main promoters of the declaration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newtactics.org/sites/newtactics.org/files/otpor%20campaigns.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111124171552/http://newtactics.org/sites/newtactics.org/files/otpor%20campaigns.pdf |archivedate=24 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}; "OTPOR campaigns New Tactics" November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, Otpor's activities were limited to the [[University of Belgrade]]. In an effort to gather new [[nonpartisan]] energy, not to mention making it harder for state media to discredit and smear them as just another opposition political group, Otpor! avoided publicizing its ties to the Democratic Party (DS) even though the two organizations held similar political goals and shared many of the same members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hereticus.org/arhiva/otporasi-su-dobili-krila-i-poleteli.html Dragan Džonić: Otporaši su dobili krila i poleteli] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425022607/http://www.hereticus.org/arhiva/otporasi-su-dobili-krila-i-poleteli.html |date=25 April 2012 }};''Hereticus'', 20 April 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Early on they agreed the organization's symbol to be the [[Raised fist|clenched fist]].

===Four students get arrested for stenciling Otpor! logo===
The authorities' immediate reaction to the appearance of Otpor! was extremely heavy-handed, even before the movement held any public gatherings. In the early morning hours of Wednesday, 4 November 1998, four students — 22-year-old Teodora Tabački (enrolled at the University of Belgrade's [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy|Faculty of Philosophy]]), Marina Glišić (22, Faculty of Philosophy), Dragana Milinković (22, [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Philology|Faculty of Philology]]), and Nikola Vasiljević (19, [[University of Arts in Belgrade|University of Arts]]' FDU) — were arrested for [[Stencil graffiti|stencil spraying]] the clenched fist symbol on the UofB's Faculty of Mathematics building facade.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy0HmPrEXn8#t=228]&lt;/ref&gt; Later that same day, after reportedly being intimidated into signing a pre-typed, joint statement of guilt, the four students were taken before a misdemeanor judge who handed them a sentence of 10 days in prison.&lt;ref name="vreme.com"&gt;[http://www.vreme.com/cms/view.php?id=940794 Gde su danas lideri Narodnog pokreta Otpor: Dnevnik jedne mladosti];''Vreme'', 15 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In his explanation of the sentence, judge Željko Muniža cited that "with their brazen and reckless behaviour, the four students have endangered the citizens' calm and disturbed the public order." On 5 November, the students' legal representatives — Nikola Barović, Branko Pavlović, and Dušan Stojković — appealed the respective sentences citing "improper use of both the misdemeanor process and the misdemeanor law as well as the scandalous subsequent sanction."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy0HmPrEXn8#t=446 Otpor]&lt;/ref&gt; One day later, the misdemeanor council rejected the appeal as baseless.

The case generated some public reaction with the University of Belgrade's Faculty of Electrical Engineering professor and Otpor! member [[Srbijanka Turajlić]] calling the sentences "inappropriate" and further scolding the University of Belgrade rector Jagoš Purić as well as University of Arts rector [[Radmila Bakočević]] for "not publicly reacting to their own students being rounded-up on the street and hauled off to jail".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy0HmPrEXn8#t=457 Otpor]&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Dnevni telegraf'' gets fined for publishing an Otpor! ad===
The organization gained further prominence when the ''[[Dnevni telegraf]]'' (daily tabloid owned and edited by [[Slavko Ćuruvija]]) 7 November issue appeared on newsstands with Otpor's ad featuring the clenched fist symbol on the front page. The paper had previously been banned for "spreading defeatism by running subversive headlines", a punishment meted out under the controversial new government decree. And though the ban was lifted within a week as the decree was put out of effect only to be replaced by the new information law, ''Dnevni telegraf'''s publishing hiatus continued past the ban being lifted and the 7 November issue was its return to the newsstands. Seeing the Otpor! ad on the front page, the authorities quickly reacted again, taking Ćuruvija and his collaborators to court within days via a trumped up private citizen's complaint and handing them another draconian fine under the information law, this time prompting the newspaper's relocation to [[Podgorica]].

===Veran Matić wears Otpor! t-shirt during MTV Europe Awards live broadcast===
Several days later, on Thursday, 12 November, another instance of Otpor's public exposure occurred — this time at the [[1998 MTV Europe Music Awards]] ceremony in [[Assago]] near [[Milan]] where [[B92|Radio B92]] was the recipient of the [[Free Your Mind (MTV award)|Free Your Mind]] award. Accepting the award presented by [[Michael Stipe]], [[Peter Buck]], and [[Mike Mills]] of [[R.E.M.]] during live broadcast, B92 head [[Veran Matić]] came out on stage in an Otpor! T-shirt with inscription "Живи Отпор!" (Live the Resistance) above the clenched fist logo. In his acceptance speech, delivered in Serbian, Matić explicitly mentioned the four students that were arrested and sentenced the previous week.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wdoyouw.org/kako-i-kada/akcije/action-images/otpor-stampani-materijali/majica-zivi-otpor Majica "Živi Otpor!"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The awards ceremony was carried live in Serbia on [[TV Košava]], a station owned at the time by Milošević's daughter Marija. However, when it came time for the Free Your Mind award to be handed out in the live broadcast, only the initial intro by R.E.M. and part of the accompanying pre-taped video piece about Radio B92 was shown before abruptly cutting to an extended block of commercials.

Otpor's first significant gathering took place on Saturday, 14 November at the [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Electrical Engineering]] &amp;ndash; over a thousand students marched across town to the [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Philology|Faculty of Philology]] where a number of students were under lockdown inside the building as the authorities wanted to prevent them from joining the protest. Otpor! leader [[Srđa Popović (activist)|Srđa Popović]] (also a member of the Democratic Party) was arrested that day and then released on intervention from [[Amnesty International]] after being detained for 8 hours. By late November, Otpor! ideas reached [[Novi Sad]], Serbia's second city, with the first graffiti appearing on buildings in the city.

During the [[1999 NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|NATO air-strikes]] against FR Yugoslavia in 1999 regarding the [[Kosovo War]], Otpor! ceased its activities. In the aftermath of NATO bombing, the organization began a political campaign aimed directly against the Yugoslav president [[Slobodan Milošević]]. This resulted in nationwide police repression against Otpor! activists, during which nearly 2,000 were arrested, some beaten.

===Organization grows into a movement===
Otpor! next managed to bring opposition parties together and mobilize the population of Serbia against Milošević. It stressed the importance of mobilizing the population to vote, but also promoted "individual resistance" (i.e. nonviolent methods of civic disobedience in order to counter
possible electoral fraud). This strategy was slowly embraced by the opposition parties in the months to come.

The strategy was based on two assumptions:
*That the opposition had to be united around one presidential candidate in order to get more votes than Milošević; and
*That Milošević would never accept defeat in the elections (and he would falsify ballots and even use force to defend his power).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gozaar.org/english/feed/library-en/democracy-classics-en/Concrete-Tactics-for-Nonviolent-Change-in-Serbia.txt |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316192054/http://www.gozaar.org/english/feed/library-en/democracy-classics-en/Concrete-Tactics-for-Nonviolent-Change-in-Serbia.txt |archivedate=16 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }};''Gozaar'', 19 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

By fall 1999 and early 2000, the Serbian opposition political parties, most notably the Democratic Party and the [[Serbian Renewal Movement]] (SPO), realized the potency of Otpor's methods and the resonance of its message with the youth. Thus began the battle for control of Otpor! between DS and SPO. Since both parties already had a significant number of their youth wing members within Otpor!, this trend continued on a large scale with both DS and SPO (and other opposition parties as well) instructing their local chapters throughout Serbia to recruit party youth members [[en masse]] into Otpor!.&lt;ref name="Selektivna anestezija"&gt;[http://www.mail-archive.com/stop-nsp@topica.com/msg02334.html Selektivna anestezija];''Blic News'', 19 October 2001&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Otpor's membership swelled into tens of thousands.

Otpor's unified message and diverse membership proved much more attractive to young activists than the deeply divided opposition parties of the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/749469.stm Analysis: Otpor's Challenge to Milosevic]&lt;/ref&gt; Although they had found common ground in Otpor!, the separate opposition parties were still reluctant to cooperate among themselves. Otpor's major challenge was to bring these divided groups together in preparation for the 2000 election campaign. Instead of using old methods of "bringing everyone to the table and then…trying to come up with a common strategy and goal", the original core group of Otpor! founders had gathered to first find a single goal that everyone could agree upon: removing Milošević.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tavaana.org/viewcasestudy.jsp?restrictids=nu_repeatitemid&amp;restrictvalues=2071502000341267131373005#_edn50] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512033241/http://www.tavaana.org/viewcasestudy.jsp?restrictids=nu_repeatitemid&amp;restrictvalues=2071502000341267131373005 |date=12 May 2012 }};''The Year Life Won in Serbia: The Otpor Movement Against Milosevic '', 17 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

During the presidential campaign of September 2000, Otpor! launched its "[[Gotov je]]" (He's Finished!) and the "Vreme Je!" (It's Time!) campaigns, which galvanized national discontent with Milošević and eventually resulted in his defeat. Some students who led Otpor! used Serbian translations of [[Gene Sharp]]'s writings on [[nonviolence|nonviolent action]] as a theoretical basis for their campaigns.

Otpor! became one of the defining symbols of the anti-Milošević struggle and his subsequent overthrow. By aiming their activities at the pool of youth [[abstainers]] and other disillusioned voters, Otpor! contributed to one of the biggest turnouts ever for the 24 September 2000 federal presidential elections with more than 4,77 million votes (72% of the total electorate).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9gGKtLTQlUcC&amp;pg=PA442&amp;lpg=PA442&amp;dq=turnout+to+serbian+elections+september+2000&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Sx8gq00z1s&amp;sig=rw265i4M-ST7O8HM7IsAG9RC6Xs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=WuWmToCqCIWB4gTUuJnhDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=turnout%20to%20serbian%20elections%20september%202000&amp;f=false ], Janusz Bugajski, "Political Parties in Eastern Europe"  2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Persuading a large number of the traditional electorate to abandon Milošević was another one of the areas where Otpor! played a key role. Milošević had in the past succeeded in persuading the public that his political opponents were traitors working for foreign interests, but in the case of Otpor!, the tactic largely backfired, as the beatings and imprisonments of their members during the summer of 2000 only further cemented the decision to vote against the government in many voters' minds.

==Strategy and tactics==

===Principles of the movement===
Otpor! operated on the basis of three principles: unity, planning, and nonviolent discipline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aforcemorepowerful.org/films/bdd/story/otpor/srdjan-milivojevic.php Interview with Srdjan Milivojevic] A Force More Powerful, 27 November 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples of specific campaigns===

Humor was the basis of Otpor's campaigns; it used irony to provoke the government and motivate Serbians to join the movement. The following are specific campaigns designed by Otpor! in 1998-2000&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120331101753/http://www.newtactics.org/sites/newtactics.org/files/otpor%20campaigns.pdf Otpor campaigns - meaning and concept Otpor campaigns - meaning and concept] CANVAS, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''A Dinar for Change:''' Otpor! activists painted Milošević's face on a barrel and set up in front of the Belgrade National Theater, asking passersby to pay one [[Yugoslav dinar]] to hit the portrait. The activists went to the sidelines and watched as the barrel attracted more and more attention. Police eventually confiscated the barrel.

'''Happy Birthday Milošević:''' Activists in [[Niš]] created this event to "celebrate" Milošević's party with a cake, a card, gifts, and wishes. More than 2,000 citizens had the opportunity to sign the card, and gifts such as handcuffs, a one-way ticket to the Hague, and a prison uniform were received on his behalf.

'''The Fist is the Salute:''' A poster campaign depicting many well-known Serbians [[Raised fist|raising their fists]] in opposition to Milošević. Over 50,000 copies were distributed. The campaign ended on New Year's with a Santa Claus fist poster.

'''Resistance, Because I Love Serbia:''' The most widespread poster campaign with a circulation of 150,000.

'''This is THE Year:''' 3,000 people gathered in downtown Belgrade for a New Year's party in January 2000. After a night of celebration, Otpor! interrupted the jubilation with pictures of the horrors of the past ten years, telling Serbian they had nothing to celebrate. The people were asked to go home peacefully and to think about how they were going to change their situation.

'''It's spreading:''' In Spring 2000, Otpor! undertook efforts to spread the movement to rural areas and the nonacademic population.

'''It's time!:''' A clock showing five minutes to twelve with the slogan "vreme je!" was used to convince all audiences that they must quickly act.

'''He's finished!:''' Otpor's most well-known campaign. Close to the elections, volunteers put up over 1,500,000 "He's finished!" ([[Gotov je]]! / Готов је!) stickers on existing posters of Milošević and all over cities.

'''Use it!''': Campaign for raising awareness of [[HIV/AIDS]] and approaching general elections in December. Posters, pamphlets, and condom packages featured stylized image of human brain.

'''Stamp it!:''' Campaign employed by Otpor! after the fall of Milošević. The campaign reminded Serbians that they must follow through by defeating Milošević in the December general elections.

==Post-Milošević==
In the immediate months following [[5th October Overthrow]], Otpor! members were suddenly the widely praised heroes throughout [[FR Yugoslavia]] as well as in the eyes of [[Western world|Western]] governments. From the wide range of local celebrities and public figures seeking positive attention by wearing Otpor! T-shirts, to [[KK Partizan|Partizan]] basketball club painting the Otpor! logo in the center circle for their [[FIBA]] [[Suproleague]] game, the clenched fist was omnipresent. This widespread popularity inspired even some individuals tied to the former government to become involved with the [[Democratic Opposition of Serbia|DOS]] authorities by praising Otpor! and its activities.

The pop-culture component of Otpor's activities became especially pronounced in this period. On 16 November, little over a month after the overthrow, Otpor! received the [[Free Your Mind (MTV award)|Free Your Mind]] award at the [[2000 MTV Europe Music Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv9R6kn2Pcc Otpor! members receiving MTV's Free Your Mind Award];2000 MTV Europe Music Awards, 16 November 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Activists Milja Jovanović and Branko Ilić were on hand in [[Stockholm]] to accept the award presented to them by French actor [[Jean Reno]]. Back home a couple of days later, FR Yugoslavia's foreign minister [[Goran Svilanović]] held a reception for Otpor's delegation consisting of Milja Jovanović, Ivan Andrić, and Nenad Konstantinović in order to congratulate them on the MTV award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2000&amp;mm=11&amp;dd=20&amp;nav_category=1&amp;nav_id=16317 SVILANOVIC PRIMIO DELEGACIJU OTPORA];B92, 20 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in early December, Serbian singer-songwriter [[Đorđe Balašević]] held a concert in Belgrade's [[National Theatre in Belgrade|National Theater]] specifically for and in praise of Otpor! members, which was televised nationally on [[RTS2]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8xVhidgsOc Balašević for Otpor!];December 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The movement even turned to concert promotion itself, organizing several [[Laibach (band)|Laibach]] gigs in Belgrade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inthesetimes.com/issue/25/07/hockenos2507.html Serbie's New Wave];''In These Times'', 5 March 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

In the midst of all the praise and adulation, the movement promised to keep on. Otpor! initially attempted to establish itself in a "watch dog" role after the revolution by launching campaigns holding the new government accountable, pressing for democratic reforms, and fighting corruption. It started weeks after the revolution with "Samo vas gledamo" (We're Watching You) campaign, sending the message of accountability to new authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://resistancestudies.org/?cat=16];'Resistance studies Network – a global network of critical studies on "resistance", 11 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel, by November 2000, with the upcoming [[Serbian parliamentary election, 2000|December 2000 parliamentary elections]], launched two campaigns named "Overi" (Verify It) and "Upotrebi ga" (Use It). Though some already questioned the movement's [[wikt:raison d'être|raison d'être]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nin.co.rs/2000-11/16/15326.html Otpor, kome?];''NIN'', 16 November 2000&lt;/ref&gt; the idea behind both was to encourage the electorate to "verify" the 5 October revolution by voting against the parties that were part of the government - the [[Socialist Party of Serbia]] (SPS) and the [[Serbian Radical Party]] (SRS) - at the upcoming constituent republic-level parliamentary election.

In 2001, the [[corruption]] monitoring becoming the new focus with several new anti-corruption campaigns started (''Bez anestezije'', etc.), but it was clear that Otpor! experienced problems staying relevant on the transformed political scene of Serbia and FR Yugoslavia.

===Revelation of U.S. involvement===
By late November 2000 information started appearing about substantial outside assistance Otpor! received leading up to the revolution. Otpor! was a recipient of substantial funds from [[U.S. government]]-affiliated organizations such as the [[National Endowment for Democracy]] (NED), [[International Republican Institute]] (IRI), and [[USAID|US Agency for International Development]] (USAID).&lt;ref name="nyt20001126"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/magazine/home/20001126mag-serbia.html|title=Who Really Brought Down Milosevic? |accessdate=2008-02-08|publisher=New York Times|date=2000-11-26|first=Roger| last=Cohen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contacting various officials from the U.S. based organizations, in his ''[[New York Times Magazine]]'' piece, journalist [[Roger Cohen]] sought to shed some light on the extent of American logistical and financial assistance received by Otpor. Paul B. McCarthy from the [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]-based [[National Endowment for Democracy|NED]] stated that Otpor! received the majority of US$3 million spent by NED in Serbia from September 1998 until October 2000. At the same time, McCarthy himself held a series of meetings with Otpor's leaders in [[Podgorica]], as well as [[Szeged]] and [[Budapest]].&lt;ref name="nyt20001126"/&gt;

Just how much of the US resources appropriated in the year 2000 by [[USAID]], for democracy and governance, which included support to groups that worked to bring an end to the Milošević era through peaceful, democratic means, went to Otpor! is not clear. However, what ''is'' clear is that the [[Democratic Opposition of Serbia]]—a broad alliance of those seeking [[Slobodan Milošević]]'s downfall, among them the [[Democratic Party (Serbia)]] Otpor! would later merge with—received in excess of $30 million to "purchase cell phones and computers for DOS's leadership and to recruit and train an army of 20,000 election monitors" as well as to supplement them with "a sophisticated marketing campaign with posters, badges and T-shirts."&lt;ref name="Gallagher, T. 2005. p.112"&gt;Gallagher, T., 2005.

Pressley, the assistant administrator at USAID said that several hundred thousand dollars were given to Otpor! directly for similar purposes.&lt;ref name=nyt20001126/&gt;

Daniel Calingaert, an official with [[International Republican Institute|IRI]], said Otpor! received "some of the US$1.8 million" his institute spent in the country throughout 2000, but didn't specify the concrete figures. He also said he met Otpor! leaders "seven to ten times" in [[Republic of Montenegro (1992–2006)|Montenegro]] (then part of [[FR Yugoslavia]]), and [[Hungary]], beginning in October 1999.&lt;ref name=nyt20001126/&gt; IRI particularly focused a lot of its attention on Otpor!, organizing a seminar on nonviolent resistance at the [[Hilton Hotel]] in Budapest during March 2000 and paying for about two dozen Otpor! leaders to attend it.&lt;ref name="wp20001211"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/decani/conversations/topics/41337|title=US Advice Guided Milosevic Opposition  |accessdate=2014-06-06|publisher=Washington Post|date=2000-12-11|first=Michael| last=Dobbs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lectured by retired U.S. Army Colonel Robert Helvey, who did two tours of duty in the [[Vietnam War]] before devoting himself to study of nonviolent resistance methods around the world, including those used in Burma and the civil rights struggle in the [[Southern United States|American South]], the Serbian students received training in such matters as how to organize a strike, how to communicate with symbols, how to overcome fear and how to undermine the authorities.&lt;ref name="wp20001211"/&gt;

===Transformation into a political party===
The official announcement of Otpor's transformation into a political party was made on 19 November 2003, days after the parliamentary elections had been set for 23 December.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.b92.rs/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2003&amp;mm=11&amp;dd=18&amp;nav_category=11&amp;nav_id=125068 Otpor od srede stranka, samostalno na izborima];B92, 18 November 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The party didn't name an official leader. However, cousins [[Slobodan Homen]] and [[Nenad Konstantinović]] played key roles. Asked about the new party's finances in November 2003, Konstantinović said it was funded by the Serbian companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2003&amp;mm=11&amp;dd=25&amp;nav_category=11&amp;nav_id=125671 U subotu izborna lista Otpora];B92, 25 November 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Otpor! started its election campaign on Saturday, 29 November 2003 by submitting its 250-person candidate list.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blic.rs/stara_arhiva/politika/51467/Otpor-i-SSJ-predali-liste 'Otpor' i SSJ predali liste];''Blic'', 1 December 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to former Otpor! activists such as Slobodan Homen, Nenad Konstantinović, Ivan Marović, Predrag Lečić, Stanko Lazendić, and Srđan Milivojević, the candidate list featured established professionals in other arenas such as professor and anti-corruption campaigner [[Čedomir Čupić]], political analyst Dušan Janjić, psychologist Žarko Trebješanin, lawyer Boža Pelević, and former [[Supreme Court of Serbia|Serbian Supreme Court]] vice-president Zoran Ivošević.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.b92.net/specijal/izbori2003/izborne_liste.php?nav_id=126820 Otpor! list]&lt;/ref&gt; The candidate list named "Otpor—Freedom, Solidarity and Justice" led by Čupić fared poorly, with only 62,116 votes (1.6% of total vote) in the [[Serbian parliamentary election, 2003|2003 Serbian parliamentary election]], which left it out of the parliament (the census required a minimum of 5%).

By spring 2004, in the aftermath of the election, the organization faced more turmoil when Branimir Nikolić, a prominent activist from Otpor's Subotica chapter, publicly accused the party central, namely Homen and Konstantinović, of embezzlement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arhiva.kurir-info.rs/Arhiva/2004/februar/28-29/V-05-27022004.shtml Otporovi milioni $]''Kurir'', 28–29 February 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, another member of Otpor!, Zoran Matović, joined Nikolić's accusations, claiming that out of the €2.1 million that came into the organization during 2001 and 2002, more than half went missing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blic.rs/stara_arhiva/politika/62294/Fali-milion-evra Novi obračun u 'Otporu': Fali milion evra];''Blic'', 28 April 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs/arhiva/2004/04/26/srpski/P04042504.shtml Pripadnici Otpora optužuju svoje kolege da su prisvojili novac od stranih sponzora: Svađa u Otporu oko dva milona dolara];''Glas javnosti'', 26 April 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Responding to the accusations in both instances, Homen announced his intention to sue both Nikolić and Matović.

===End===
In early September 2004, amid internal turmoil, the remnants of Otpor! merged into the [[Democratic Party (Serbia)|Democratic Party]] led by [[Boris Tadić]].

The observer reaction in Serbia to the dissolution of Otpor! was mixed. Some talked of Otpor's "ideologically heterogeneous membership that in addition to progressives also contained those well infected with Milošević's war propaganda", seeing the organization's eventual demise in the post-Milošević period as the victory of the latter over the former,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nedimsejdinovic.com/o-smrti-otpora-i-jos-pone%C4%8Dem-ko-%C4%87e-da-grize-los-sistem-vrednosti/ O SMRTI "OTPORA" I JOŠ PONEČEM: Ko će da grize loš sistem vrednosti?];nedimsejdinovic.com, 2 September 2004&lt;/ref&gt; while others believed Otpor's failure in the political arena was caused by its inability to disassociate itself from foreign aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carnegiecouncil.org/resources/articles_papers_reports/0087.html/_res/id=sa_File1/JoksicSperri_Otpor.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603140820/http://www.carnegiecouncil.org/resources/articles_papers_reports/0087.html/_res/id=sa_File1/JoksicSperri_Otpor.pdf |archivedate=3 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }} From Resistance to Revolution and Back Again&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commemorative reunions and usage of Otpor! symbols===
In the years since its dissolution, Otpor's symbols and imagery occasionally reappeared in Serbian political life. Some of the former Otpor! activists also organized a few official commemorative gatherings.

In April 2008, during the election campaign ahead of the [[Serbian parliamentary election, 2008|parliamentary election]], the clenched fist was stenciled on several walls in Novi Sad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naslovi.net/2008-04-08/gradjanski/pesnica-otpora-ponovo-u-novom-sadu/632188 Pesnica "Otpora" ponovo u Novom Sadu] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120909003605/http://www.naslovi.net/2008-04-08/gradjanski/pesnica-otpora-ponovo-u-novom-sadu/632188 |date=9 September 2012 }};''Građanski list'', April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; This led to an announcement of Otpor's reactivation by its former activist Nenad Šeguljev,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,3260552,00.html Ponovo aktiviranje "Otpora", policija i privođenje novinara];''[[Deutsche Welle]]'', 11 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2008&amp;mm=04&amp;dd=11&amp;nav_id=49319 Otpor says it's back in business] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113022230/http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2008&amp;mm=04&amp;dd=11&amp;nav_id=49319 |date=13 November 2012 }};B92, 11 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; however nothing ever came of it.

Later that year on 13 November, Serbian president Boris Tadić held a reception to commemorate the 10th anniversary of Otpor's founding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beta-video.tv/?page=play&amp;id=1641&amp;naslov=Tadi%C4%87%20primio%20predstavnike%20Otpora Tadić primio predstavnike Otpora]&lt;/ref&gt; Former activists Srđa Popović, Slobodan Đinović, Slobodan Homen, Nenad Konstantinović, Dejan Ranđić, Ivan Andrić, Andreja Stamenković, Milja Jovanović, Branko Ilić, Srđan Milivojević, Jovan Ratković, Predrag Lečić, Vlada Pavlov, Stanko Lazendić, Miloš Gagić, and Siniša Šikman were on hand at the presidential palace at [[Andrićev Venac]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alo.rs/politika/9526/Tadic_primio_otporase Tadić primio otporaše] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405114917/http://www.alo.rs/politika/9526/Tadic_primio_otporase |date=5 April 2012 }};''[[Alo!]]'', 14 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; giving Tadic an old Otpor! poster.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rts.rs//page/stories/sr/story/9/Srbija/27388/Deset+godina+od+osnivanja+Otpora.html Deset godina od osnivanja Otpora];RTS, November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Tadić underscored Otpor's "important role in the democratization of Serbia".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Politika/65362/Tadic-Otpor-imao-vaznu-ulogu-u-reformama-Srbije Tadić: „Otpor" imao važnu ulogu u reformama Srbije];''Blic'', 14 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, in [[Stari dvor]], the exhibition of Otpor's materials was opened with Belgrade mayor [[Dragan Đilas]] saluting the former movement for "the courage shown in the fight for democratic changes and thus enabling others to live in a normal country".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressonline.rs/sr/vesti/vesti_dana/story/51315/Otvorena+izlo%C5%BEba+povodom+desetogodi%C5%A1njice+osnivanja+Otpora.html Otvorena izložba povodom desetogodišnjice osnivanja Otpora];''Press'', 14 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, posters with clenched fist and a message "Pruži Otpor svakoj lošoj vlasti" (Resist all bad authorities) appeared all over the city of [[Bor, Serbia|Bor]], protesting the local authorities' decision to build a roundabout.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mc.kcbor.net/2011/07/26/otkrivamo-otpor-ponovo-u-boru/ OTKRIVAMO: "OTPOR" PONOVO U BORU];Medija Centar Bor 26 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011, the Democratic Party (DS) official web site (ds.org.rs) was taken down by unknown hackers who left the Otpor! logo on the site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kurir-info.rs/vesti/politika/hakeri-srusili-sajtove-borisa-tadica-i-ds-137328.php HAKERI SRUŠILI SAJTOVE BORISA TADIĆA I DS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018103411/http://www.kurir-info.rs/vesti/politika/hakeri-srusili-sajtove-borisa-tadica-i-ds-137328.php |date=18 October 2011 }};''Kurir'', 16 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Otpor! leaders after Otpor!==
Though its members often proudly talked of the movement's "horizontal [[command hierarchy]]" and its lack of established leadership structure,&lt;ref name="Šta je Otpor: Pesnica u oku režima"&gt;[http://www.vreme.com/arhiva_html/488/04.html Šta je Otpor: Pesnica u oku režima];''Vreme'', 13 May 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Otpor! still exhibited a top-down organizational model with several members from its Belgrade central office clearly asserting themselves as the main decision makers.&lt;ref name="vreme.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Selektivna anestezija"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20010208171353/http://blicnews.gates96.com/aktuelno/0politika/polit3.htm Danas, kada postajem političar...];''Blic News'', 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Their involvement in Otpor! served as a springboard to Serbian political, business, and NGO careers.

===Srđa Popović and Ivan Marović===
In terms of media exposure, [[Srđa Popović (activist)|Srđa Popović]] is Otpor's best known member. He features prominently in Western television news items and documentaries about the movement such as the BAFTA-winning feature documentary ''[[How to Start a Revolution]]'' and [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]' ''[[Bringing Down A Dictator]]'' as well as numerous international print and Internet media pieces about the direct and indirect influence of former Otpor! members on various post-2000 revolutions around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://motherjones.com/politics/2010/03/maldives-democracy-popovic Fantasy Island: Democracy Edition];''Mother Jones'', March/April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/02/16/revolution_u?page=full Revolution U];''Foreign Policy'', 16 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/content/exporting_nonviolent_revolution_eastern_europe_mideast/2316231.html Exporting Nonviolent Revolution, From Eastern Europe To The Middle East];Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty, 21 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitaljournal.com/article/304401 Arab Uprisings, from Serbia];DigitalJournal.com, 8 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blueprint for a revolution"&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/0ad005b4-5043-11e0-9ad1-00144feab49a.html#axzz1atudTSsT Blueprint for a revolution];''Financial Times'', 18 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/so-you-want-a-revolution-2351909.html So you want a revolution...];''The Independent'', 11 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/world/detail/83037/#ixzz10LSwel5R ''Celebrating 10 years of revolution-Kiyv Post'', October 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Politika/222509/Srdja-Popovic-Kako-bismo-se-mi-osecali-da-je-neko-bojkotovao-Andrica];''Blic'', 9 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leibovitz, Liel, "The Revolutionist", March 2012, The Atlantic, https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/03/the-revolutionist/8881/, 30 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Manea, Octavian and Srdja Popovic, "The Non-Violent Struggle as Asymmetric Warfare: Interview with Srdja Popovic", 26 March 2012, Small Wars Journal, http://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/nonviolent-struggle-as-asymmetric-warfare-interview-with-srdja-popovic, 30 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Emma, "A Velvet Fist", May/June 2012, Intelligent Life Magazine, http://moreintelligentlife.com/content/ideas/a-velvet-fist?page=0%2C0, 30 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Shortly after 5 October 2000 revolution, he left Otpor! to pursue a political career in Serbia, becoming a Democratic Party (DS) MP in the Serbian assembly as well as an environmental adviser to prime minister [[Zoran Đinđić]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aforcemorepowerful.org/films/bdd/story/cast.php Bringing Down The Dictator] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170509090050/http://www.aforcemorepowerful.org/films/bdd/story/cast.php |date=9 May 2017 }};PBS 2002&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, it was 27-year-old Popović's return to the DS since he was active in the party's youth wing since the early 1990s.

Simultaneous to his political engagement, Popović, together with former colleagues from Otpor! Predrag Lečić and Andreja Stamenković, founded the environmental non-governmental organization Green Fist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rectivitysrv.rec.org/fmi/xsl/NGODirectory/browserecord.xsl?-find=-find&amp;-lay=All_field&amp;-recid=2668 NGO directory] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425144944/http://rectivitysrv.rec.org/fmi/xsl/NGODirectory/browserecord.xsl?-find=-find&amp;-lay=All_field&amp;-recid=2668 |date=25 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conceptualized as an "ecological movement", it attempted to transfer some of Otpor's mass appeal into environmental issues by using similar imagery, but soon folded.

In 2003, Popović, with another prominent former Otpor! member [[Slobodan Đinović]], co-founded [[Centre for Applied Non Violent Actions and Strategies]], (CANVAS), an organization focused on the use of nonviolent conflict to promote human rights and democracy, and eventually quit actively participating in Serbian politics. Instead, he started to cooperate with [[Stratfor]], which paid for Popović lectures about CANVAS fomenting color revolutions also in Iran, Venezuela and Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|edition = First printing |title = Branding Democracy: U.S. Regime Change in Post-Soviet Eastern Europe|url = https://www.amazon.com/Branding-Democracy-Post-Soviet-Frontiers-Communication/dp/1433105314|publisher = Peter Lang Publishing Inc.|date = 2010-02-24|location = New York, NY|isbn = 9781433105319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Popović and two of his former Otpor! colleagues, now CANVAS members - Slobodan Đinović and Andrej Milivojević - authored a book called ''Nonviolent Struggle: 50 Crucial Points'', a how-to guide to nonviolent struggle, which can be downloaded for free in six languages from their website.&lt;ref&gt;[https://af.reuters.com/article/libyaNews/idAFLDE75E24020110616?pageNumber=2&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0 Reuters: Serbian activist teaches lessons in revolution Thursday 16 June 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; The book was financed with a grant from the [[United States Institute of Peace]] (USIP), an organization founded and funded by the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://reason.com/archives/2006/09/21/the-50-habits-of-highly-effect The 50 Habits of Highly Effective Revolutionaries];''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'', 21 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The book has been downloaded some 20,000 times in the Middle East, mostly by Iranians.&lt;ref&gt;Wölfl, Adelhaid (10.03.2011) ''Gewaltloser kampf, 50 entscheidended punkte – Serbiche beratung bei revolutionen'', Der Standard&lt;/ref&gt; Due to their involvement in regime changes all around the globe, CANVAS has been labeled "Academy of Revolution" while Popović and others involved in the organization have been referred to by various media outlets as "professors of revolution",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-jackson/the-professors-of-protest_b_842255.html]; John Jackson at Huffington Post, April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; "revolution consultants",&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpGWkPBpMaY The Legacy of Otpor];Deutsche Welle, 24 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; "professional revolutionaries", and "revolution exporters".&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpGWkPBpMaY Serbia: The Legacy of Otpor | European Journal];Deutsche Welle, 24 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 Popović became adviser to Serbian deputy prime minister [[Božidar Đelić]].

Popović additionally heads the Ecotopia fund,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecotopia.rs Ecotopia]&lt;/ref&gt; the non-profit organization dealing with the environmental issues, financially backed by various Serbian governmental institutions as well as the private sector. In 2009, the fund organized a wide environmental campaign featuring well-known Serbian actors and media personalities with television spots and newspaper ads.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/user/ekotopija Ecotopia]&lt;/ref&gt; On top of that Popović is a board member of International Communications Partners, a media and PR consulting company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icp-co.com/ International Communications Partners]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, in addition to their revolution-consulting and training activities through CANVAS that according to one report take up a third of their year,&lt;ref name="Blueprint for a revolution"/&gt; Popović is active on the speaking engagement circuit throughout various Western countries where they're frequently hired by universities, institutes, and think-tanks to give lectures and hold workshops on strategy and organization of nonviolent struggle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://calendar.columbia.edu/sundial/webapi/get.php?brand=sipa_sa&amp;id=48840&amp;vt=detail&amp;context=standalone Columbia, SIPA 5 April 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2008. Popović and Đinović have also launched CANVAS-related graduate program in cooperation with University of Belgrade's Faculty of Political Science.&lt;ref&gt;[http://972mag.com/can-nonviolence-move-the-next-century/16017/ Can Nonviolence Move  The Next Century?], Chronicle Of Higher Education, Todd Gitlin une 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2011 to 2012, Popovic was a visiting scholar at Columbia University's [[Harriman Institute]].

In November 2011, ''[[Foreign Policy Magazine]]'' listed Srdja Popovic as one of the "Top 100 Global Thinkers" of 2011  for inspiring the [[Arab Spring]] protesters directly and indirectly and educating activists about nonviolent social change in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;[https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/11/28/the_fp_top_100_global_thinkers?page=0,8 Foreign Policy Magazine: 2011 Top Global Thinkers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141012135256/http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/11/28/the_fp_top_100_global_thinkers?page=0,8 |date=12 October 2014 }};''Foreign Policy Magazine'', December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, Srdja Popovic was named to "The Smart List 2012" by ''[[Wired UK]]'' magazine as one of 50 people who will change the world.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2012/02/features/the-smart-list]&lt;/ref&gt;

Popovic appeared in the 2011 [[BAFTA]] award-winning film, ''[[How to Start a Revolution]]''.

In addition to Popović, [[Ivan Marović]] is another Otpor! activist with significant media presence, both before and after Milošević fell. During the movement's activist days leading up to the overthrow, his appearances in the anti-government Serbian media were in the capacity of one of the movement's spokespeople.&lt;ref name="Šta je Otpor: Pesnica u oku režima"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs/arhiva/2000/05/31/srpski/P00053006.shtm Ivan Marović, istaknuti aktivista Otpora, za "Glas": Ako treba, ulazimo u SPS];''Glas javnosti'', 30 May 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

He stayed at Otpor! even after the transformation into the political party and was its MP candidate at the December 2003 parliamentary election. He also became active on the speaking engagement circuit, mostly in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;[http://pressonline.rs/sr/vesti/vesti_dana/story/181291/Srbi+i+CIA+organizovali+ustanak+u+Americi.html Teorija zavere - konzervativci optužuju: Srbi i CIA organizovali ustanak u Americi];''Press'', 14 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; where like Popović he gives lectures on his experiences from Otpor! days. Additionally, Marović is one of the designers behind ''[[A Force More Powerful]]'' and ''[[People Power: The Game of Civil Resistance]]'', video games that promote nonviolent struggle as a political tool. During the mid-2000s (decade) he moved to the United States where in 2007 he earned his master's degree from the [[The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy|Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy]] at [[Tufts University]] in [[Medford, Massachusetts]]. In the late 2000s (decade) he returned to Serbia. Since the mid-2000s (decade), he has maintained a blog on B92.net.

===Slobodan "Cole" Homen and Nenad "Neca" Konstantinović===
Unlike Popović and Marović, [[Slobodan Homen]] mostly kept behind the scenes while at Otpor!. Born to affluent parents - prominent Belgrade lawyers Borivoje Homen and Dušanka Subotić - young Slobodan was raised in privileged circumstances. During his days studying law, before becoming one of Otpor's founding members, he was the president of the University of Belgrade's student parliament. Described by sources quoted in the Serbian media&lt;ref name="vreme.com"/&gt; as Otpor's "alpha and omega" during the movement's heyday in the spring and summer of 2000, Homen and his cousin [[Nenad Konstantinović]] handled everything from money to transportation. Homen was also the main point of contact for the foreign-based organizations that donated significant funds to Otpor!. Otpor's headquarters was owned by Homen's family. Some accused Homen of an obvious conflict of interest in this situation after allegations appeared that his family actually rented out the space to Otpor!, which was paying for it with the money from the incoming donations.&lt;ref name="Selektivna anestezija"/&gt;

After Milošević's overthrow, Homen and Konstantinović were of the opinion that Otpor! should evolve into a political party, which put them at odds with some of the movement's other activists. The two eventually got their way in 2003, but did poorly at the parliamentary elections later that year. Simultaneously, Homen and his family were involved in various high-profile real-estate business ventures in the city of Belgrade, some of which raised controversy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-novine.com/srbija/srbija-tema/41245-Otimaina-sto-potenih-naina.html Dosije: Porodično blago imperije Homen Otimačina na sto poštenih načina]; e-novine.com, 8 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

After Otpor! merged into the Democratic Party, Homen set about building a political career there. In 2008, he became state secretary in the Serbian Ministry of Justice working under cabinet minister [[Snežana Malović]], within the government of prime minister [[Mirko Cvetković]]. Following the 10 October 2010 [[Belgrade anti-gay riot|mass rioting]] by the right-wing groups in protest of the Belgrade gay pride parade, standing in front of the Democratic Party headquarters that were attacked by the rioters, Homen went on state-television airwaves, delivering a threatening message to the "hooligans". Speaking to a reporter, Homen said: "I can guarantee you that they'll remember this day because the state's response to this will be chilling".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEsTJe5ESHw Homen on 10 October 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2011, Homen was named the Serbian government's PR coordinator.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Politika/243489/Slobodan-Homen-Od-Otpora-do-vladinog-koordinatora-za-PR Slobodan Homen: Od "Otpora" do vladinog koordinatora za PR];''Blic'', 24 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slobodan Đinović===
During his Otpor! days, [[Slobodan Đinović]], leader of the student organization at the University of Belgrade's Faculty of Mechanical Engineering,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canvasopedia.org/slobodan-%C4%91inovi%C4%87.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005210114/http://www.canvasopedia.org/slobodan-%C4%91inovi%C4%87.php |archivedate=5 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; founded an NGO called the Center for Political Analysis (CPA).&lt;ref name="Selektivna anestezija"/&gt; The idea behind the venture was to set up an organization ready to become an alternative source for disseminating information in case Milošević shut down all the non-governmental media outlets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blic.rs/stara_arhiva/politika/10994/Selektivna-anestezija-kod-otporasa 'Blic News' u novom broju o mahinacijama vođa 'Otpora': Selektivna anestezija kod 'otporaša'];''Blic News'', 17 October 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after Milošević fell, Đinović founded Media Works, the first [[Wi-Fi]] provider in Serbia. Center for Political Analysis eventually folded as Đinović decided to focus more on his budding telecommunications business. In parallel, he was active with CANVAS.

In early 2010, Media Works merged with wired Internet providers Neobee.net and SezamPro to form Orion Telekom, of which Đinović is the CEO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oriontelekom.rs Orion Telekom]&lt;/ref&gt; Utilizing a government-issued licence for providing [[fixed wireless]] services that Media Works won in 2009, Orion began offering [[fixed telephony]] services throughout Serbia using the [[Code division multiple access|CDMA]] method of access in June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Drustvo/194876/Orion-poceo-sa-pruzanjem-usluga-fiksne-telefonije "Orion" počeo sa pružanjem usluga fiksne telefonije];''Blic'', 21 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In the documentary film ''The Revolution Business'' produced by Austrian TV ORF and distributed by [[Journeyman Pictures]], Srdja Popović claimed Đinović is the main financial backer of CANVAS.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbEwoUiCoTo The Revolution Business];Journeyman Pictures&lt;/ref&gt; Đinović is also the managing board member of the state-owned Ada Ciganlija company, which manages the public grounds of the [[Ada Ciganlija|eponymous river island]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.arhiv.rs/Develop/vesti.nsf/PregledVestiDana/F3664B023B8909C9C12578800035241C?OpenDocument Monopolisti vladaju telekomunikacijama];''NIN'', 28 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ivan Andrić and Dejan Ranđić===
The creative presence behind many of Otpor's visuals and media campaigns was Ivan Andrić. After the revolution, he left the movement for politics, joining the [[Civic Alliance of Serbia]] (GSS) and becoming managing board member of the state-owned [[Belgrade Youth Center]]. He later joined the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Serbia 2005)|Liberal Democratic Party]] (LDP), becoming its MP. Furthermore, in 2002, with close friend from Otpor! days and Youth Center managing board colleague [[Dejan Ranđić]] (who would also later go on to become high-ranking LDP official), Andrić founded the marketing agency Gistro Advertising&lt;ref&gt;[http://vimeo.com/27902221 Gistro Advertising]&lt;/ref&gt; that has in the years since done prominent product launches and ad campaigns for various clients in Serbia such as government ministries, political parties (including the transformed Otpor!), local municipalities, and state-owned enterprises.&lt;ref name="vreme.com"/&gt;

==Legacy==
In addition to contributing to Slobodan Milošević's overthrow, Otpor! has become the
model for similar youth movements around Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name="guardian20050606"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Traynor, Ian| title=Young democracy guerrillas join forces| journal=[[The Guardian]]| date=2005-06-06| page=16}} Available at {{cite web |url=http://www.mjaft.org/pdf/the_guardians_activism_festival.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-02-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725050303/http://www.mjaft.org/pdf/the_guardians_activism_festival.pdf |archivedate=25 July 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; MTV granted Otpor the [[Free Your Mind (MTV award)|Free Your Mind]] award in 2000. There were several award-winning documentaries made about the movement, most notably ''[[Making of The Revolution]]'' by Eric Van Den Broek and Katarina Rejger (launched at the Amnesty International Film Festival in 2001) and ''[[Bringing Down A Dictator]]'' by Steve York, which won a Peabody Award in 2002, narrated by Martin Sheen. It has reportedly been seen by over 23 million people around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bringing Down A Dictator]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Otpor! members were instrumental in inspiring and providing hands-on training to several other civic youth organizations in [[Eastern Europe]] and elsewhere, including [[Kmara]]&lt;ref name="ferdeggan"&gt;[http://www.ferdeggan.net/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/60to69.pdf  60 Revolution In The Revolution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070116153809/http://www.ferdeggan.net/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/60to69.pdf |date=16 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Georgia (country)|Republic of Georgia]] (itself partly responsible for the [[Rose Revolution|downfall]] of [[Eduard Shevardnadze]]), [[Pora]] (black)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patriotmagazin.com/arhiva/0240/media/008.htm Otporaši na Maldivima]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eurasianet.org"&gt;[http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/civilsociety/articles/pp041105.shtml FLEDGLING YOUTH GROUPS WORRY POST-SOVIET AUTHORITIES] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222044746/http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/civilsociety/articles/pp041105.shtml |date=22 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (which was part of the [[Orange Revolution]]) and [[Vidsich]] (opposing the president [[Viktor Yanukovych]]) in [[Ukraine]], [[Zubr (political organization)|Zubr]]&lt;ref name="ferdeggan"/&gt; in [[Belarus]] (opposing the president [[Alexander Lukashenko]]), [[MJAFT!]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alb-net.com/pipermail/kan-info/2003-July/000003.html MJAFT! press release] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014095523/http://www.alb-net.com/pipermail/kan-info/2003-July/000003.html |date=14 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Albania]], [[Oborona]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3996/is_200701/ai_n19432273/pg_21 Orange People: A Brief History of Transnational Liberation Networks in East Central Europe]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Russia]] (opposing the president [[Vladimir Putin]]), [[KelKel]]&lt;ref name="eurasianet.org"/&gt; in [[Kyrgyzstan]] (active in the revolution that brought down the president [[Askar Akayev]]), [[Bolga organization|Bolga]] in Uzbekistan&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nonviolent-conflict.org/PDF/GuardianDemocracyGuerrillas.pdf Young democracy guerrillas join forces] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005103108/http://www.nonviolent-conflict.org/PDF/GuardianDemocracyGuerrillas.pdf |date=5 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (opposing [[Islam Karimov]]) and [[:uk:Пульс свободи|Nabad-al-Horriye]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defnat.com/en/acc_frames/resultat.asp?cid_article=20051209&amp;ccodoper=3&amp;cid=200512&amp;ctypeencours=0 The new revolutionaries]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Lebanon]]. A similar group of students was present in Venezuela against [[Hugo Chávez]]. In 2008, an [[April 6 Youth Movement]] was founded in [[Egypt]], which facilitated and joined the [[2011 Egyptian protests]], and took advice from Otpor! in the process.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/14/world/middleeast/14egypt-tunisia-protests.html?_r=1&amp;hp Egyptians and Tunisians Collaborated to Shake Arab History] [[The New York Times]], 13 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/14/world/middleeast/14egypt-tunisia-protests.html?hp=&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1297656097-vGFYS7755whguQSAOstilA | title=New York Times | accessdate=2011-02-13 |author1=KIRKPATRICK, DAVID  |author2=SANGER, DAVID  |lastauthoramp=yes | date=2011-02-13 | publisher=New York Times | page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12522848 Gene Sharp: Author of the nonviolent revolution rulebook], BBC News, Ruaridh Arrow, 21 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, some former Otpor! members, most notably Slobodan Đinović and Srđa Popović, founded the Centre for Applied Nonviolent Action and Strategies (CANVAS). This NGO disseminated the lessons learned from their successful nonviolent struggle through scores of trainings and workshops for pro-democracy activists and others around the world, including in Egypt, Palestine, Western Sahara, West Papua, Eritrea, Belarus, Azerbaijan, Tonga, Burma and Zimbabwe as well as labor, anti-war, and immigration rights activists in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/stephen-zunes/serbia-10-years-later_b_216856.html Serbia: 10 Years Later]; ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', 17 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In their search for lessons learned from other activist movements, the [[April 6 Youth Movement]] in [[Egypt]] consulted with Otpor! members and adopted some of their strategies in their rallying for the [[2011 Egyptian revolution]].&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite news

In interviews, the leaders and consultants of Otpor! have described their involvement in the planning, coordination and implementation of the 2011 "Arab spring" revolutions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.journeyman.tv/62012/short-films/the-revolution-business.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Otpor! was an inspiration for SQUELCH!, a satirical political party in the [[University of California, Berkeley]]'s student government.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3180">A '''packaging gas''' is used to pack sensitive materials such as [[food]] into a [[modified atmosphere]] environment. The [[gas]] used is usually [[inert gas|inert]], or of a nature that protects the integrity of the packaged goods, inhibiting unwanted chemical reactions such as food [[Food spoilage|spoilage]] or [[oxidation]]. Some may also serve as a propellant for [[aerosol spray]]s like cans of [[whipped cream]]. For packaging food, the use of various gases is approved by regulatory organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cleanroom-technology.co.uk/technical/article_page/The_purity_of_gases/55228|title=The purity of gases|publisher=Cleanroom Technology 21 June 2010|accessdate=15 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their [[E number]]s are included in the following lists in parentheses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.food.gov.uk/safereating/chemsafe/additivesbranch/enumberlist|title=Current EU approved additives and their E Numbers|publisher=Food standards agency 26 November 2010|accessdate=15 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inert gases==
These gas types do not cause a chemical change to the substance that they protect.
* [[argon]] (E938), used for canned products
* [[helium]] (E939), used for canned products
* [[nitrogen]] (E941), also propellant
* [[carbon dioxide]] (E290), also propellant

==Propellant gases==
Specific kinds of packaging gases are [[Aerosol spray#Aerosol propellants|aerosol propellants]]. These process and assist the ejection of the product from its container.
* [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s known as CFC (E940 and E945), rarely used because of the damage that they do to the [[ozone layer]]:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.speclab.com/compound/c75718.htm Spectrum Laboratories : Chemical Fact Sheet - Cas # 75718&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[dichlorodifluoromethane]] (E940)
** [[chloropentafluoroethane]] (E945)
* [[nitrous oxide]] (E942), used for aerosol whipped cream canisters (see [[Nitrous oxide#Aerosol propellant|Nitrous oxide: Aerosol propellant]])
* [[octafluorocyclobutane]] (E946)

==Reactive gases==
These must be used with caution as they may have adverse effects when exposed to certain chemicals. They will cause oxidisation or contamination to certain types of materials.
* [[oxygen]] (E948), used e.g. for packaging of vegetables
* [[hydrogen]] (E949)

==Volatile gases==
[[Hydrocarbon]] gases approved for use with food need to be used with extreme caution as they are highly combustible, when combined with oxygen they burn very rapidly and may cause explosions in confined spaces. Special precautions must be taken when transporting these gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.food.gov.uk/news/newsarchive/2002/jun/purity_criteria_foodadditives|title=Amendment to Directive 96/77/EC on purity criteria of food additives|publisher=Food standards agency 27 June 2002|accessdate=15 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attackers may have justified their attacks seeking a greater good but the attacks of innocents failed the greater good test even among the attackers standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blunt|first1=Gwilym David|title=Thomas Pogge, ''Politics as Usual: What Lies Behind Pro-Poor Rhetoric''|journal=Opticon1826|date=1 September 2011|volume=6|issue=11|doi=10.5334/opt.111114|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/opticon1826/currentissue/reviews/Blunt_Issue11_Opticon1826.pdf|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He expands to state that the terrorists were wrong to attack in the name of religion and that the governments are also at fault for the war on terror because they inflict harm upon the innocents without considering the moral implications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=Chris|title=War on terror.

=== International Reforms  ===
Thomas Pogge contends that we are violating our negative duty not to harm the poor by supporting oppressive regimes which further cements their position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Timmermann|first1=Cristian|title=The Health Impact Fund and the Right to Participate in the Advancement of Science|journal=European Journal of Applied Ethics|date=2012|volume=1|issue=1|page=2|url=http://sammelpunkt.philo.at:8080/2202/1/timmermann_ejae.pdf|accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pogge states that the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]  gives people specific [[economic rights]]  and including  "Everyone has a right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care.", which is  violated by the international economic system we now have.&lt;ref name=gleaner /&gt;

== Reviews ==
Ruth Jack of ''The Kelvingrove Review'' states that Pogge's argument that world leaders not only allow the status quo to persist but actively and knowingly collude to maintain it for their own ends is not convincing while Pogge's  statistical analysis of the depth of [[world poverty]] are accurate and should be noted.&lt;ref name=kelvingrove /&gt;

S. Subramanian states that the book makes for painful reading, not because of the author but because of the topic, it states many crimes against humanity,&lt;ref name=THE /&gt; also described as "unimaginable cost of lives as a result of injustices against the poor addressed by his work".&lt;ref name=appiah /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="51961">'''Project Blue Book''' was one of a series of systematic studies of [[unidentified flying object]]s (UFOs) conducted by the [[United States Air Force]]. It started in 1952, and it was the third study of its kind (the first two were projects [[Project Sign|Sign]] (1947) and [[Project Grudge|Grudge]] (1949)). A termination order was given for the study in December 1969, and all activity under its auspices ceased in January 1970.&lt;!--see research by Brad Sparks in "the end" below to support 1970 date--&gt;

Project Blue Book had two goals:
# To determine if UFOs were a threat to [[national security]], and
# To [[Scientific method|scientifically analyze]] UFO-related [[data]].
Thousands of UFO reports were collected, analyzed and filed. As the result of the ''[[Condon Report]]'' (1968), which concluded there was nothing anomalous about UFOs, Project Blue Book was ordered shut down in December 1969 and the Air Force continues to provide the following summary of its investigations:

{{blockquote|
#No UFO reported, investigated and evaluated by the  Air Force was ever an indication of threat to our national security;
#There  was no evidence submitted to or discovered by the Air Force that  sightings categorized as "unidentified" represented technological  developments or principles beyond the range of modern scientific  knowledge; and
#There was no evidence indicating that sightings  categorized as "unidentified" were extraterrestrial vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120719123429/http://www.af.mil/information/factsheets/factsheet_print.asp?fsID=188&amp;page=1 "UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS AND AIR FORCE PROJECT  BLUE BOOK"]  URL accessed February 21, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By the time Project Blue Book ended, it had collected 12,618 UFO reports, and concluded that most of them were misidentifications of natural [[phenomena]] ([[cloud]]s, [[star]]s, etc.) or conventional aircraft. According to the [[National Reconnaissance Office]] a number of the reports could be explained by flights of the formerly secret reconnaissance planes [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] and [[Lockheed A-12|A-12]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Reconnaissance Office Review and Redaction Guide: Appendix C - Glossary of Code Words and Terms|url=http://nro.gov/foia/NRO_RRG_redacted.PDF|publisher=National Reconnaissance Office|year=2008}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; A small percentage of UFO reports were classified as unexplained, even after stringent analysis. The UFO reports were archived and are available under the [[Freedom of information legislation|Freedom of Information Act]], but names and other personal information of all witnesses have been [[Redaction|redacted]].

==Previous projects==
Public USAF UFO studies were first initiated under [[Project Sign]] at the end of 1947, following many widely publicized UFO reports (see [[Kenneth Arnold]]). Project Sign was initiated specifically at the request of General [[Nathan Twining]], chief of the [[Air Force Materiel Command]] at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]]. Wright-Patterson was also to be the home of Project Sign and all subsequent official USAF public investigations.

Sign was officially inconclusive regarding the cause of the sightings. However, according to US Air Force Captain [[Edward J. Ruppelt]] (the first director of Project Blue Book), Sign's initial intelligence estimate (the so-called [[Estimate of the Situation]]) written in the late summer of 1948, concluded that the flying saucers were real craft, were not made by either the [[Soviet Union]] or [[United States]], and were likely [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] in origin. (See also [[extraterrestrial hypothesis]].) This estimate was forwarded to the Pentagon, but subsequently ordered destroyed by Gen. [[Hoyt Vandenberg]], USAF Chief of Staff, citing a lack of physical proof. Vandenberg subsequently dismantled Project Sign.

Project Sign was succeeded at the end of 1948 by [[Project Grudge]], which was criticized as having a [[debunker|debunking]] mandate. Ruppelt referred to the era of Project Grudge as the "dark ages" of early USAF UFO investigation. Grudge concluded that all UFOs were natural phenomena or other misinterpretations, although it also stated that 23 percent of the reports could not be explained.

===The Captain Ruppelt era===
According to Captain [[Edward J. Ruppelt]], by the end of 1951, several high-ranking, very influential USAF generals were so dissatisfied with the state of Air Force UFO investigations that they dismantled Project Grudge and replaced it with Project Blue Book in March 1952. One of these men was Gen. [[Charles P. Cabell]]. Another important change came when General [[William Garland (Air Force Officer)|William Garland]] joined Cabell's staff; Garland thought the UFO question deserved serious scrutiny because he had witnessed a UFO.&lt;ref name=swords103&gt;Dr. Michael D. Swords; "UFOs, the Military, and the Early Cold War Era", pages 82-121 in "UFOs and Abductions: Challenging the Borders of Knowledge" David M. Jacobs, editor; 2000, University Press of Kansas, {{ISBN|0-7006-1032-4}}; p103.&lt;/ref&gt;

The new name, Project Blue Book, was selected to refer to the blue booklets used for testing at some colleges and universities. The name was inspired, said Ruppelt, by the close attention that high-ranking officers were giving the new project; it felt as if the study of UFOs was as important as a college final exam. Blue Book was also upgraded in status from Project Grudge, with the creation of the [[Aerial Phenomenon Branch]].&lt;ref&gt;see Clark, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruppelt was the first head of the project. He was an experienced airman, having been decorated for his efforts with the Army Air Corps during [[World War II]], and having afterward earned an aeronautics degree. He officially coined the term "Unidentified Flying Object", to replace the many terms ("flying saucer" "flying disk" and so on) the military had previously used; Ruppelt thought that "unidentified flying object" was a more neutral and accurate term. Ruppelt resigned from the Air Force some years later, and wrote the book ''The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects'', which described the study of UFOs by United States Air Force from 1947 to 1955.  American scientist [[Michael D. Swords]] wrote that "Ruppelt would lead the last genuine effort to analyze UFOs".&lt;ref name=swords102&gt;Dr. Michael D. Swords; "UFOs, the Military, and the Early Cold War Era", p102&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruppelt implemented a number of changes: He streamlined the manner in which UFOs were reported to (and by) military officials, partly in hopes of alleviating the stigma and ridicule associated with UFO witnesses. Ruppelt also ordered the development of a standard questionnaire for UFO witnesses, hoping to uncover data which could be subject to statistical analysis. He commissioned the [[Battelle Memorial Institute]] to create the questionnaire and computerize the data. Using case reports and the computerized data, Battelle then conducted a massive scientific and statistical study of all Air Force UFO cases, completed in 1954 and known as "[[Project Blue Book#Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14|Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14]]" (see summary below).

Knowing that factionalism had harmed the progress of [[Project Sign]], Ruppelt did his best to avoid the kinds of open-ended speculation that had led to Sign's personnel being split among advocates and critics of the [[extraterrestrial hypothesis]]. As Michael Hall writes, "Ruppelt not only took the job seriously but expected his staff to do so as well. If anyone under him either became too skeptical or too convinced of one particular theory, they soon found themselves off the project."&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20061209172010/http://www.nicap.dabsol.co.uk/51-69.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, Ruppelt reported that he fired three personnel very early in the project because they were either "too pro" or "too con" one hypothesis or another. Ruppelt sought the advice of many scientists and experts, and issued regular [[press releases]] (along with classified monthly reports for military intelligence).

Each U.S. Air Force Base had a Blue Book officer to collect UFO reports and forward them to Ruppelt.&lt;ref name=Blum&gt;Blum, Howard, ''Out There: The Government's Secret Quest for Extraterrestrials'', Simon and Schuster, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; During most of Ruppelt's tenure, he and his team were authorized to interview any and all military personnel who witnessed UFOs, and were not required to follow the [[chain of command]]. This unprecedented authority underlined the seriousness of Blue Book's investigation.

Under Ruppelt's direction, Blue Book investigated a number of well-known UFO cases, including the so-called [[Lubbock Lights]], and a widely publicized 1952 radar/visual case over [[Washington D.C.]]. According to [[Jacques Vallee]],&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: On UFOs, Folklore and Parallel Worlds (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; Ruppelt started the trend, largely followed by later Blue Book investigations, of not giving serious consideration to numerous reports of UFO landings and/or interaction with purported UFO occupants.

Astronomer Dr. [[J. Allen Hynek]] was the scientific consultant of the project, as he had been with Projects Sign and Grudge. He worked for the project up to its termination and initially created the categorization which has been extended and is known today as [[Close encounter]]s. He was a pronounced skeptic when he started, but said that his feelings changed to a more wavering skepticism during the research, after encountering a minority of UFO reports he thought were unexplainable. &lt;!-- whoever wrote the following sentence: "according to what is often said on web pages.  The book he wrote (Close Encounters) stated the opposite and explains how such misinformation arises." is clueless. Hynek never wrote a book called "Close Encounters," and several of his books devote considerable space to UFO reports Hynek regards as inexplicable.--&gt;

Ruppelt left Blue Book in February 1953 for a temporary reassignment. He returned a few months later to find his staff reduced from more than ten, to two subordinates. Frustrated, Ruppelt suggested that an Air Defense Command unit (the 4602nd Air Intelligence Service Squadron) be charged with UFO investigations.

====Robertson Panel====
{{Main|Robertson Panel}}

In July 1952, after a build-up of hundreds of sightings over the previous few months, a series of radar detections coincident with visual sightings were observed near the National Airport in Washington, D.C. (see [[1952 Washington D.C. UFO incident]]). Future Arizona Senator and 2008 presidential nominee [[John McCain]] is alleged to be one of these witnesses{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}.

After much publicity, these sightings led the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] to establish a panel of scientists headed by Dr. H. P. Robertson, a physicist of the California Institute of Technology, which included various physicists, meteorologists, and engineers, and one astronomer (Hynek). The Robertson Panel first met on January 14, 1953 in order to formulate a response to the overwhelming public interest in UFOs.

Ruppelt, Hynek, and others presented the best evidence, including movie footage, that had been collected by Blue Book. After spending 12 hours reviewing 6 years of data, the Robertson Panel concluded that most UFO reports had prosaic explanations, and that all could be explained with further investigation, which they deemed not worth the effort.

In their final report, they stressed that low-grade, unverifiable UFO reports were overloading intelligence channels, with the risk of missing a genuine conventional threat to the U.S. Therefore, they recommended the Air Force de-emphasize the subject of UFOs and embark on a debunking campaign to lessen public interest. They suggested debunkery through the mass media, including [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Productions]], and using psychologists, astronomers, and celebrities to ridicule the phenomenon and put forward prosaic explanations.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Furthermore, civilian UFO groups "should be watched because of their potentially great influence on mass thinking… The apparent irresponsibility and the possible use of such groups for subversive purposes should be kept in mind."

It is the conclusion of many researchers&lt;ref name=Blum /&gt;&lt;ref name=clark&gt;Jerome Clark, ''The UFO Book: Encyclopedia of the Extraterrestrial'', 1998; Detroit: Visible Ink Press, {{ISBN|1-57859-029-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the Robertson Panel was recommending controlling public opinion through a program of official propaganda and spying. They also believe these recommendations helped shape Air Force policy regarding UFO study not only immediately afterward, but also into the present day. There is evidence that the Panel's recommendations were being carried out at least two decades after its conclusions were issued (see the main article for details and citations).

In December 1953, Joint Army-Navy-Air Force Regulation number 146 made it a crime for military personnel to discuss classified UFO reports with unauthorized persons. Violators faced up to two years in prison and/or fines of up to $10,000.

====Aftermath of Robertson Panel====
{{refimprove section|date=December 2012}}
{{Wikisource|Air Force Regulation 200-2, Unidentified Flying Objects Reporting}}
In his book (see external links) Ruppelt described the demoralization of the Blue Book staff and the stripping of their investigative duties following the Robertson Panel jurisdiction.

As an immediate consequence of the Robertson Panel recommendations, in February 1953, the Air Force issued Regulation 200-2, ordering air base officers to publicly discuss UFO incidents only if they were judged to have been solved, and to classify all the unsolved cases to keep them out of the public eye.

The same month, investigative duties started to be taken on by the newly formed 4602nd Air Intelligence Squadron (AISS) of the Air Defense Command. The 4602nd AISS was assigned the task of investigating only the most important UFO cases with intelligence or national security implications. These cases were deliberately siphoned away from Blue Book, leaving Blue Book to deal with the more trivial reports.

General [[Nathan Twining]], who started Project Sign in 1947, was now Air Force Chief of Staff. In August 1954, he was to further codify the responsibilities of the 4602nd AISS by issuing an updated Air Force Regulation 200-2. In addition, UFOs (called "UFOBs") were defined as "any airborne object which by performance, aerodynamic characteristics, or unusual features, does not conform to any presently known aircraft or missile type, or which cannot be positively identified as a familiar object."  Investigation of UFOs was stated to be for the purposes of national security and to ascertain "technical aspects." AFR 200-2 again stated that Blue Book could discuss UFO cases with the media only if they were regarded as having a conventional explanation. If they were unidentified, the media was to be told only that the situation was being analyzed. Blue Book was also ordered to reduce the number of unidentified to a minimum.

All this work was done secretly. The public face of Blue Book continued to be the official Air Force investigation of UFOs, but the reality was it had essentially been reduced to doing very little serious investigation, and had become almost solely a public relations outfit with a debunking mandate. To cite one example, by the end of 1956, the number of cases listed as unsolved had dipped to barely 0.4 percent, from the 20 to 30% only a few years earlier.

Eventually, Ruppelt requested reassignment; at his departure in August 1953, his staff had been reduced from more than ten (precise numbers of personnel varied) to just two subordinates and himself. His temporary replacement was a [[noncommissioned officer]]. Most who succeeded him as Blue Book director exhibited either apathy or outright hostility to the subject of UFOs, or were hampered by a lack of funding and official support.

UFO investigators often regard Ruppelt's brief tenure at Blue Book as the high-water mark of public Air Force investigations of UFOs, when UFO investigations were treated seriously and had support at high levels.&lt;ref name=clark /&gt; Thereafter, Project Blue Book descended into a new "Dark Ages" from which many UFO investigators argue it never emerged.&lt;ref name=clark /&gt; However, Ruppelt later came to embrace the Blue Book perspective that there was nothing extraordinary about UFOs; he even labeled the subject a "Space Age Myth."

===The Captain Hardin era===
In March 1954, Captain Charles Hardin was appointed the head of Blue Book; however, the 4602nd conducted most UFO investigations, and Hardin did not object. Ruppelt wrote that Hardin "thinks that anyone who is even interested [in UFOs] is crazy. They bore him."&lt;ref name=clark468&gt;Jerome Clark, ''The UFO Book: Encyclopedia of the Extraterrestrial'', p468&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, the Air Force decided that the goal of Blue Book should not be to investigate UFO reports, but to minimize the number of unidentified UFO reports. By late 1956, the number of unidentified sightings had dropped from the 20-25% of the Ruppelt era, to less than 1%.

===The Captain Gregory era===
Captain George T. Gregory took over as Blue Book's director in 1956. Clark writes that Gregory led Blue Book "in an even firmer anti-UFO direction than the apathetic Hardin."&lt;ref name=clark468 /&gt; The 4602nd was dissolved, and the 1066th Air Intelligence Service Squadron was charged with UFO investigations.

In fact, there was actually little or no investigation of UFO reports; a revised AFR 200-2 issued during Gregory's tenure emphasized that unexplained UFO reports must be reduced to a minimum.

One way that Gregory reduced the number of unexplained UFOs was by simple reclassification. "Possible cases" became "probable", and "probable" cases were upgraded to certainties. By this logic, a ''possible'' [[comet]] became a ''probable'' comet, while a probable comet was flatly declared to have been a misidentified comet. Similarly, if a witness reported an observation of an unusual balloon-''like'' object, Blue Book usually classified it as a balloon, with no research and qualification. These procedures became standard for most of Blue Book's later investigations; see Hynek's comments below.

===The Major Friend era===
Major Robert J. Friend was appointed the head of Blue Book in 1958. Friend made some attempts to reverse the direction Blue Book had taken since 1954. Clark writes that "Friend's efforts to upgrade the files and catalog sightings according to various observed statistics were frustrated by a lack of funding and assistance."&lt;ref name=clark468 /&gt;

Heartened by Friend's efforts, Hynek organized the first of several meetings between Blue Book staffers and ATIC personnel in 1959. Hynek suggested that some older UFO reports should be reevaluated, with the ostensible aim of moving them from the "unknown" to the "identified" category. Hynek's plans came to naught.

During Friend's tenure, ATIC contemplated passing oversight Blue Book to another Air Force agency, but neither the Air Research and Development Center, nor the Office of Information for the Secretary of the Air Force was interested.

In 1960, there were U.S. Congressional hearings regarding UFOs. Civilian UFO research group [[National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena|NICAP]] had publicly charged Blue Book with covering up UFO evidence, and had also acquired a few allies in the U.S. Congress. Blue Book was investigated by the Congress and the CIA, with critics—most notably the civilian UFO group NICAP&lt;ref name=clark /&gt; asserting that Blue Book was lacking as a scientific study. In response, ATIC added personnel (increasing the total personnel to three military personnel, plus civilian secretaries) and increased Blue Book's budget. This seemed to mollify some of Blue Book's critics,&lt;ref name=clark /&gt; that but it was only temporary. A few years later (see below), the criticism would be even louder.

By the time he was transferred from Blue Book in 1963, Friend thought that Blue Book was effectively useless and ought to be dissolved, even if it caused an outcry amongst the public.

===The Major Quintanilla era===
Major [[Hector Quintanilla]] took over as Blue Book's leader in August 1963. He largely continued the debunking efforts, and it was under his direction that Blue Book received some of its sharpest criticism. UFO researcher Jerome Clark goes so far as to write that, by this time, Blue Book had "lost all credibility."&lt;ref name=clark592&gt;Jerome Clark, ''The UFO Book: Encyclopedia of the Extraterrestrial'', p592&lt;/ref&gt;

Physicist and UFO researcher Dr. [[James E. McDonald]] once flatly declared that Quintanilla was "not competent" from either a scientific or an investigative perspective, &lt;ref name=Druffel63&gt;Ann Druffel; ''Firestorm: Dr. James E. McDonald's Fight for UFO Science''; 2003, Wild Flower Press; {{ISBN|0-926524-58-5}}, p63&lt;/ref&gt; although he also stressed that Quintanilla "shouldn't be held accountable for it," as he was chosen for his position by a superior officer, and was following orders in directing Blue Book.&lt;ref name=Druffel63 /&gt;

Blue Book's explanations of UFO reports were not universally accepted, however, and critics — including some scientists — suggested that Project Blue Book performed questionable research or, worse, was perpetrating [[cover up]].&lt;ref name=clark /&gt; This criticism grew especially strong and widespread in the 1960s.

Take, for example, the many mostly nighttime UFO reports from the midwestern and southeastern United States in the summer of 1965: Witnesses in [[Texas]] reported "multicolored lights" and large aerial objects shaped like [[egg (biology)|eggs]] or diamonds.&lt;ref name=clark /&gt; The Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported that [[Tinker Air Force Base]] (near [[Oklahoma City]]) had tracked up to four UFOs simultaneously, and that several of them had descended very rapidly: from about 22000 feet to about 4000 feet in just a few seconds,&lt;ref name=clark /&gt; an action well beyond the capabilities of conventional aircraft of the era. John Shockley, a [[meteorologist]] from [[Wichita, Kansas]], reported that, using the state Weather Bureau [[radar]], he tracked a number of odd aerial objects flying at altitudes between about 6000 and 9000 feet.&lt;ref name=clark /&gt; These and other reports received wide publicity.

Project Blue Book officially determined&lt;ref name=clark /&gt; the witnesses had mistaken [[Jupiter]] or bright [[star]]s (such as [[Rigel]] or [[Betelgeuse]]) for something else.

Blue Book's explanation was widely criticized as inaccurate. Robert Riser, director of the Oklahoma Science and Art Foundation [[Planetarium]] offered a strongly worded rebuke of Project Blue Book that was widely circulated: “That is as far from the truth as you can get. These stars and [[planet]]s are on the opposite side of the earth from Oklahoma City at this time of year. The [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] must have had its star finder upside-down during August."&lt;ref name=clark /&gt;

A newspaper editorial from the ''Richmond News Leader'' opined that "Attempts to dismiss the reported sightings under the rationale as exhibited by Project Bluebook (sic) won't solve the mystery … and serve only to heighten the suspicion that there's something out there that the air force doesn't want us to know about",&lt;ref name=clark /&gt; while a Wichita-based [[UPI]] reporter noted  that "Ordinary radar does not pick up planets and stars."&lt;ref name=clark /&gt;

Another case that Blue Book's critics seized upon was the so-called [[Portage County UFO Chase]], which began at about 5.00am, near [[Ravenna, Ohio]] on April 17, 1966. Police officers Dale Spaur and Wilbur Neff spotted what they described as a disc-shaped, silvery object with a bright light emanating from its underside, at about 1000 feet in altitude.&lt;ref name=clark /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see also [[Portage County UFO chase]] page for further details&lt;/ref&gt; They began following the object (which they reported sometimes descended as low as 50 feet), and police from several other jurisdictions were involved in the pursuit. The chase ended about 30 minutes later near [[Freedom, Pennsylvania]], some 85 miles away.

The UFO chase made national news, and the police submitted detailed reports to Blue Book. Five days later, following brief interviews with only one of the police officers (but none of the other ground witnesses), Blue Book's director, Major [[Hector Quintanilla]], announced their conclusions: The police (one of them an Air Force gunner during the [[Korean War]]) had first chased a [[communications satellite]], then the planet Venus.

This conclusion was widely derided,&lt;ref name=clark /&gt; and police officers strenuously rejected it. In his dissenting conclusion, Hynek described Blue Book's conclusions as absurd: in their reports, several of the police had unknowingly described the moon, Venus ''and'' the UFO, though they unknowingly described Venus as a bright "star" very near the moon. Ohio Congressman [[J. William Stanton|William Stanton]] said that "The Air Force has suffered a great loss of prestige in this community … Once people entrusted with the public welfare no longer think the people can handle the truth, then the people, in return, will no longer trust the government."

In September 1968, Hynek received a letter from Colonel Raymond Sleeper of the [[Foreign Technology Division]]. Sleeper noted that Hynek had publicly accused Blue Book of shoddy science, and further asked Hynek to offer advice on how Blue Book could improve its scientific methods. Hynek was to later declare that Sleeper's letter was "the first time in my 20 year association with the air force as scientific consultant that I had been officially asked for criticism and advice [regarding] … the UFO problem."&lt;ref name=clark477&gt;Jerome Clark, ''The UFO Book: Encyclopedia of the Extraterrestrial'', p477&lt;/ref&gt;

Hynek wrote a detailed response, dated October 7, 1968, suggesting several areas where Blue Book could improve. In part, he wrote:

{{Ordered list|list-style-type=upper-latin
|... neither of the two missions of Blue Book [determining if UFOs are a threat to national security and using scientific data gathered by Blue Book] are being adequately executed.
| The staff of Blue Book, both in numbers and in scientific training, is grossly inadequate...
| Blue Book suffers … in that it is a closed system ... there is virtually no scientific dialogue between Blue Book and the outside scientific world...
| The [[statistics|statistical]] methods employed by Blue Book are nothing less than a travesty.
| There has been a lack of attention to significant UFO cases ... and too much time spent on routine cases ... and on peripheral public relations tasks. Concentration could be on two or three potentially scientific significant cases per month [instead of being] spread thin over 40 to 70 cases per month.
| The information input to Blue Book is grossly inadequate. An impossible load is placed on Blue Book by the almost consistent failure of UFO officers at local air bases to transmit adequate information... 
| The basic attitude and approach within Blue Book is illogical and unscientific...
| Inadequate use had been made of the Project scientific consultant [Hynek himself]. Only cases that the ''project monitor'' deems worthwhile are brought to his attention. His scope of operation ... has been consistently thwarted ... He often learns of interesting cases only a month or two after the receipt of the report at Blue Book.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Clark, ''The UFO Book: Encyclopedia of the Extraterrestrial'', 1998; Detroit: Visible Ink Press, p478–479; emphasis as in original&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Despite Sleeper's request for criticism, none of Hynek's commentary resulted in any substantial changes in Blue Book.

[[Hector Quintanilla|Quintanilla's]] own perspective on the project is documented in his manuscript, "[http://www.nidsci.org/pdf/quintanilla.pdf UFOs, An Air Force Dilemma].” Lt. Col Quintanilla wrote the manuscript in 1975, but it was not published until after his death. Quintanilla states in the text that he personally believed it arrogant to think human beings were the only intelligent life in the universe. Yet, while he found it highly likely that intelligent life existed beyond earth, he had no hard evidence of any extra terrestrial visitation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nidsci.org/pdf/quintanilla.pdf | Quintanilla, H. (1974). UFOs, An Air Force Dilemma.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Congressional hearing===

In 1966, a string of UFO sightings in Massachusetts and New Hampshire provoked a Congressional Hearing by the House Committee on Armed Services.&lt;ref&gt;"Unidentified Flying Objects."

"It was impossible to mistake what we saw for any kind of military operation, regardless of altitude," the irritated officers wrote, adding that there was no way it could have been a balloon or helicopter.&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand, Eugene, and Hunt, David.

By the time of the hearing, Blue Book had identified and explained 95% of the reported UFO sightings. None of these were extraterrestrial or a threat to national security.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Brown, Harold.

Allen Hynek, a science consultant to Blue Book, suggested in an unedited statement that a "civilian panel of physical and social scientists" be formed "for the express purpose of determining whether a major problem really exist" in regards to UFOs.&lt;ref&gt;Hynek, J. Allen. "Unidentified Flying Objects." 6008.&lt;/ref&gt; Hynek remarked that  he has "not seen any evidence to confirm" extraterrestrials, "nor do I know any competent scientist who has, or who believes that any kind of extraterrestrial intelligence is involved." &lt;ref&gt;Hynek."Unidentified Flying Objects. 6046.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Condon Committee===
{{Main|Condon Committee}}

Criticism of Blue Book continued to grow through the mid-1960s. [[NICAP]]'s membership ballooned to about 15,000, and the group charged the U.S. Government with a [[cover-up]] of UFO evidence.

Following U.S. Congressional hearings, the [[Condon Committee]] was established in 1966, ostensibly as a neutral scientific research body. However, the Committee became mired in controversy, with some members charging director [[Edward U. Condon]] with bias, and critics would question the validity and the scientific rigor of the Condon Report.

In the end, the Condon Committee suggested that there was nothing extraordinary about UFOs, and while it left a minority of cases unexplained, the report also argued that further research would not be likely to yield significant results.

===The end===
In response to the Condon Committee's conclusions, Secretary of the Air Force [[Robert C. Seamans, Jr.]] announced that Blue Book would soon be closed, because further funding "cannot be justified either on the grounds of national security or in the interest of science."&lt;ref name=clark480&gt;Jerome Clark, ''The UFO Book: Encyclopedia of the Extraterrestrial'', p480&lt;/ref&gt; The last publicly acknowledged day of Blue Book operations was December 17, 1969. However, researcher Brad Sparks,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.project1947.com/shg/proceedings/shgproceed1.pdf Proceedings of the Sign Historical Group UFO History Workshop]&lt;/ref&gt; citing research from the May, 1970 issue of NICAP's ''UFO Investigator'', reports that the last day of Blue Book activity was actually January 30, 1970. According to Sparks, Air Force officials wanted to keep the Air Force's reaction to the UFO problem from overlapping into a fourth decade, and thus altered the date of Blue Book's closure in official files.

Blue Book's files were sent to the Air Force Archives at [[Maxwell Air Force Base]] in [[Alabama]]. Major David Shea was to later claim that Maxwell was chosen because it was "accessible yet not too inviting."&lt;ref name=clark480 /&gt;

Ultimately, Project Blue Book stated that UFOs sightings were generated as a result of:

*A mild form of [[mass hysteria]].
*Individuals who fabricate such reports to perpetrate a [[hoax]] or seek publicity.
*[[Psychopathological]] persons.
*Misidentification of various conventional objects.

In April 2003, the USAF publicly indicated that there were no immediate plans to re-establish any official government UFO study programs.&lt;ref name=usaf&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030624053806/http://www.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?fsID=188 USAF Fact Sheet 95-03]&lt;/ref&gt; However, in December 2017 it was disclosed that a new secret UFO study titled the [[Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program]] was funded at over 20 million dollars a year from 2007 to 2012.&lt;ref name="NYT-20171216"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cooper |first1=Helene |last2=Blumenthal |first2=Ralph |last3=Kean |first3=Lesie |title=Glowing Auras and ‘Black Money’: The Pentagon’s Mysterious U.F.O.

==USAF current official statement on UFOs==
Below is the United States Air Force's official statement regarding UFOs, as noted in USAF Fact Sheet 95-03:&lt;ref name=usaf /&gt;

{{quote|From 1947 to 1969, the Air Force investigated Unidentified Flying Objects under Project Blue Book. The project, headquartered at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]], Ohio, was terminated December 17, 1969. Of a total of 12,618 sightings reported to Project Blue Book, 701 remained "unidentified."

The decision to discontinue UFO investigations was based on an evaluation of a report prepared by the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]] entitled, "[[Condon Report|Scientific Study of Unidentified Flying Objects]];" a review of the University of Colorado's report by the National Academy of Sciences; previous UFO studies and Air Force experience investigating UFO reports during 1940 to 1969.

As a result of these investigations, studies and experience gained from investigating UFO reports since 1948, the conclusions of Project Blue Book were:

# No UFO reported, investigated, and evaluated by the Air Force has ever given any indication of threat to our national security.
# There has been no evidence submitted to or discovered by the Air Force that sightings categorized as "unidentified" represent technological developments or principles beyond the range of present day scientific knowledge.
# There has been no evidence indicating the sightings categorized as "unidentified" are extraterrestrial vehicles.

With the termination of Project Blue Book, the Air Force regulation establishing and controlling the program for investigating and analyzing UFOs was rescinded. Documentation regarding the former Blue Book investigation was permanently transferred to the Modern Military Branch, [[National Archives]] and Records Service, and is available for public review and analysis.

Since the termination of Project Blue Book, nothing has occurred that would support a resumption of UFO investigations by the Air Force.

There are a number of universities and professional scientific organizations that have considered UFO phenomena during periodic meetings and seminars. A list of private organizations interested in aerial phenomena may be found in "Encyclopaedia of Associations", published by Gale Research. Interest in and timely review of UFO reports by private groups ensures that sound evidence is not overlooked by the scientific community. Persons wishing to report UFO sightings should be advised to contact local law enforcement agencies.}}

===Post-Blue Book U.S.A.F. UFO activities===
An Air Force memorandum (released via the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]]) dated October 20, 1969 and signed by Brigadier General [[C.H. Bolander]] states that even after Blue Book was dissolved, that "reports of UFOs" would still "continue to be handled through the standard Air Force procedure designed for this purpose." Furthermore, wrote Bolander, "Reports of unidentified flying objects which could affect national security … are not part of the Blue Book system."&lt;ref name=Randles179&gt;[[Jenny Randles]] and Peter Houghe; ''The Complete Book of UFOs: An Investigation into Alien Contact and Encounters''; Sterling Publishing Co, Inc, 1994; {{ISBN|0-8069-8132-6}}, p179&lt;/ref&gt; To date, these other investigation channels, agencies or groups are unknown.

Additionally, Blum reports&lt;ref name=Blum /&gt; that [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] requests show that the U.S. Air Force has continued to catalog and track UFO sightings, particularly a series of dozens of UFO encounters from the late 1960s to the mid-1970s that occurred at U.S. military facilities with [[nuclear weapons]]. Blum writes that some of these official documents depart drastically from the normally dry and bureaucratic wording of government paperwork, making obvious the sense of "terror" that these UFO incidents inspired in many U.S.A.F. personnel.

==Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2012}}
In late December 1951, Ruppelt met with members of the [[Battelle Memorial Institute]], a think tank based in Columbus, Ohio. Ruppelt wanted their experts to assist them in making the Air Force UFO study more scientific. It was the Battelle Institute that devised the standardized reporting form. Starting in late March 1952, the Institute started analyzing existing sighting reports and encoding about 30 report characteristics onto [[IBM]] [[punched cards]] for computer analysis.

Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14 was their massive statistical analysis of Blue Book cases to date, some 3200 by the time the report was completed in 1954, after Ruppelt had left Blue Book. Even today, it represents the largest such study ever undertaken. Battelle employed four scientific analysts, who sought to divide cases into "knowns", "unknowns", and a third category of "insufficient information." They also broke down knowns and unknowns into four categories of quality, from excellent to poor. E.g., cases deemed excellent might typically involve experienced witnesses such as airline pilots or trained military personnel, multiple witnesses, corroborating evidence such as radar contact or photographs, etc. In order for a case to be deemed a "known", only two analysts had to independently agree on a solution. However, for a case to be called an "unknown", all four analysts had to agree. Thus the criterion for an "unknown" was quite stringent.

In addition, sightings were broken down into six different characteristics — color, number, duration of observation, brightness, shape, and speed — and then these characteristics were compared between knowns and unknowns to see if there was a statistically significant difference.

The main results of the statistical analysis were:

* About 69% of the cases were judged known or identified (38% were considered conclusively identified while 31% were still "doubtfully" explained); about 9% fell into insufficient information. About 22% were deemed "unknown", down from the earlier 28% value of the Air Force studies.
* In the known category, 86% of the knowns were aircraft, balloons, or had astronomical explanations. Only 1.5% of all cases were judged to be psychological or "[[crackpot (person)|crackpot]]" cases. A "miscellaneous" category comprised 8% of all cases and included possible hoaxes.
* The higher the quality of the case, the more likely it was to be classified unknown. 35% of the excellent cases were deemed unknowns, as opposed to only 18% of the poorest cases.

(More detailed statistics can be found at [[Identified flying object]]s.)

Despite this, the summary section of the Battelle Institute's final report declared it was "highly improbable that any of the reports of unidentified aerial objects... represent observations of technological developments outside the range of present-day knowledge."  A number of researchers, including Dr. [[Bruce Maccabee]], who extensively reviewed the data, have noted that the conclusions of the analysts were usually at odds with their own statistical results, displayed in 240 charts, tables, graphs and maps. Some conjecture that the analysts may simply have had trouble accepting their own results or may have written the conclusions to satisfy the new political climate within Blue Book following the Robertson Panel.

When the Air Force finally made Special Report #14 public in October 1955, it was claimed that the report scientifically proved that UFOs did not exist. Critics of this claim note that the report actually proved that the "unknowns" were distinctly different from the "knowns" at a very high [[statistical significance]] level. The Air Force also incorrectly claimed that only 3% of the cases studied were unknowns, instead of the actual 22%. They further claimed that the residual 3% would probably disappear if more complete data were available. Critics counter that this ignored the fact that the analysts had already thrown such cases into the category of "insufficient information", whereas both "knowns" and "unknowns" were deemed to have sufficient information to make a determination. Also the "unknowns" tended to represent the higher quality cases, q.e. reports that already had better information and witnesses.

The result of the monumental BMI study were echoed by a 1979 French [[GEIPAN|GEPAN]] report which stated that about a quarter of over 1,600 closely studied UFO cases defied explanation, stating, in part, "These cases … pose a real question."&lt;ref name=Randles2202&gt;[[Jenny Randles]] and Peter Houghe; ''The Complete Book of UFOs: An Investigation into Alien Contact and Encounters''; Sterling Publishing Co, Inc, 1994; {{ISBN|0-8069-8132-6}}, p202&lt;/ref&gt; When GEPAN's successor [[GEIPAN|SEPRA]] closed in 2004, 5800 cases had been analyzed, and the percentage of inexplicable unknowns had dropped to about 14%. The head of SEPRA, Dr. [[Jean-Jacques Velasco]], found the evidence of extraterrestrial origins so convincing in these remaining unknowns, that he wrote a book about it in 2005.

==Hynek's criticism==
Hynek was an associate member of the [[Robertson Panel]], which recommended that UFOs needed [[debunker|debunking]]. A few years later, however, Hynek's opinions about UFOs changed, and he thought they represented an unsolved mystery deserving scientific scrutiny. As the only scientist involved with US Government UFO studies from the beginning to the end, he could offer a unique perspective on Projects Sign, Grudge, and Blue Book.

After what he described as a promising beginning with a potential for scientific research, Hynek grew increasingly disenchanted with Blue Book during his tenure with the project, leveling accusations of indifference, incompetence, and of shoddy research on the part of Air Force personnel. Hynek notes that during its existence, critics dubbed Blue Book "The Society for the Explanation of the Uninvestigated."&lt;ref name=Hynek180&gt;J. Allen Hynek; ''The UFO Experience: A Scientific Inquiry''; 1972; Henry Regenery Company, p180&lt;/ref&gt;

Blue Book was headed by Ruppelt, then Captain Hardin, Captain Gregory, Major Friend, and finally Major Hector Quintanilla. Hynek had kind words only for Ruppelt and Friend. Of Ruppelt, he wrote "In my contacts with him I found him to be honest and seriously puzzled about the whole phenomenon."&lt;ref name=Hynek175&gt;J. Allen Hynek; ''The UFO Experience: A Scientific Inquiry''; 1972; Henry Regenery Company, p175&lt;/ref&gt; Of Friend, he wrote "Of all the officers I worked with in Blue Book, Colonel Friend earned my respect. Whatever private views he may have held, he was a total and practical realist, and sitting where he could see the scoreboard, he recognized the limitations of his office but conducted himself with dignity and a total lack of the bombast that characterized several of the other Blue Book heads."&lt;ref name=Hynek187&gt;J. Allen Hynek; ''The UFO Experience: A Scientific Inquiry''; 1972; Henry Regenery Company, p187&lt;/ref&gt;

He held Quintanilla in especially low regard: "Quintanilla's method was simple: disregard any evidence that was counter to his hypothesis."&lt;ref name=Hynek103&gt;J. Allen Hynek; ''The UFO Experience: A Scientific Inquiry''; 1972; Henry Regenery Company, p103&lt;/ref&gt; Hynek wrote that during Air Force Major [[Hector Quintanilla]]'s tenure as Blue Book's director, “the flag of the utter nonsense school was flying at its highest on the mast.” Hynek reported that Sergeant David Moody, one of Quintanilla's subordinates, “epitomized the conviction-before-trial method. Anything that he didn't understand or didn't like was immediately put into the psychological category, which meant ‘[[crackpot (person)|crackpot]]'.”

Hynek reported bitter exchanges with Moody when the latter refused to research UFO sightings thoroughly, describing Moody as “the master of the possible: possible balloon, possible aircraft, possible birds, which then became, by his own hand (and I argued with him violently at times) the probable.”

==Project Blue Book in fiction==

===''Project U.F.O.''===
Project Blue Book was the inspiration for the 1978–1979 TV show ''[[Project U.F.O.]]'' (which was known as ''Project Blue Book'' in some countries), which was supposedly based on Project Blue Book cases. However, the show frequently went against the actual project conclusions, suggesting on many occasions that some sightings were real extraterrestrials.

===''Twin Peaks''===
Project Blue Book played a major role in the second season of the 1990–1991 TV series ''[[Twin Peaks]]''. [[Major Garland Briggs]], an Air Force officer who worked on the program, approaches protagonist [[Dale Cooper]] and reveals that Cooper's name turned up in an otherwise nonsensical radio transmission intercepted by the Air Force, which inexplicably originated from the woods surrounding the town of Twin Peaks. As the season progresses, it is revealed that the source of the transmission is the transdimensional realm of the [[Black Lodge]], inhabited by beings which feed on the human emotions of pain and suffering; it eventually comes out that Briggs worked with Cooper's rival, corrupt FBI agent [[Windom Earle]], on Project Blue Book, and that the two men apparently uncovered evidence of the Lodge during the course of their work.

===''Galactica 1980''===
Every episode of the original ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]'' spin-off series ''[[Galactica 1980]]'' ended with a short statement about the U.S. Air Force's 1969 Project Blue Book findings that UFOs are not proven to exist and "are not a threat to national security".

===''Project Blue Book (2018)''===
An upcoming [[Project Blue Book (TV series)|drama series]] slated to air on the [[History Channel]] late 2018, '''Project Blue Book''' is based on the true, top-secret investigations into Unidentified Flying Objects.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;[https://www.history.com/shows/project-blue-book/about Project Blue Book-About]&lt;/ref&gt;

([https://www.webcitation.org/6SRQoTSbA archive])&lt;/ref&gt;

The printer used to create the bullet retails around $800 as of September 2014, and it took the printer about an hour to produce the slug.&lt;ref name="wired.com"/&gt; ABS thermoplastic material was used in the production of the slug.&lt;ref name="wired.com"/&gt; During testing, the slug fired from a Mossberg 590 shotgun,&lt;ref name="dailymail.co.uk"/&gt; penetrated a 2×12 piece of pine wood, and created a hole in a wire reel.&lt;ref name="wired.com"/&gt;

It is considered as the first 3D printed bullet, according to the creator each plastic slug was 3D-printed but a small lead shot was then added to give the bullet weight and enable it to travel and pierce the target.&lt;ref name="dailymail.co.uk"/&gt;

The '''Rhodesian Front''' was a [[conservative]] [[political party]] in [[Rhodesia]]&lt;ref name="hsu-luckett-vause"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hsu|first1=Chia Yin|last2=Luckett|first2=Thomas M.|last3=Vause|first3=Erika|title=The Cultural History of Money and Credit: A Global Perspective|date=2015|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=9781498505932|pages=142|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ByLuCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA142|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Onslow"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Onslow|first1=Sue|title=Cold War in Southern Africa: White Power, Black Liberation|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135219338|page=92|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Xj-MAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA92|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Butler"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Butler|first1=L.

Led first by [[Winston Field]], and, from 1964, by [[Ian Smith]], the Rhodesian Front was the successor to the [[Dominion Party]], which was the main opposition party in Southern Rhodesia during the [[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland|Federation]] period. The RF was formed in March 1962 by whites opposed to any immediate or short-term transition to black [[majority rule]]. It won power in the [[Southern Rhodesia general election, 1962|general election]] that December. In successive elections (in which 50 of the 66 parliamentary seats were reserved for A-Roll voters, who had to meet a higher standard of qualifications, increasing the proportion of white Africans who came under this roll) between 1964 and 1979, the RF was returned to office, with a large majority, with Smith as Prime Minister.

==History==
The RF had fifteen founding principles, which included the preservation of each racial group's right to maintain its own identity, the preservation of 'proper standards' through a policy of advancement through merit, the maintenance of the [[Land reform in Zimbabwe|Land Apportionment Act]], which formalised the racial imbalance in the ownership and distribution of land, opposition to compulsory [[racial integration]], job protection for white workers, and maintenance of the government's right to provide separate amenities for different races.

Following the elections leading to the country's independence in 1980, as the Republic of Zimbabwe, the RF won all 20 parliamentary seats reserved for whites in the power-sharing agreement that it had forged. On June 6, 1981, the party changed its name to the [[Republican Front (Zimbabwe)|Republican Front]], and on July 21, 1984 it became the [[Conservative Alliance of Zimbabwe]]. Eleven of its twenty parliamentarians defected over the following four years, but the party again won 15 of the 20 parliamentary seats reserved for whites in the [[Zimbabwe parliamentary election, 1985|1985 election]]. In 1986, the CAZ opened its membership to Zimbabweans of all races.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/23/world/around-the-world-ian-smith-invites-blacks-to-join-his-party.html Ian Smith Invites Blacks to Join His Party], ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 23, 1984, p. A5.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987 the ruling government abolished all reserved seats for whites.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.csmonitor.com/1987/0825/ozim.html Zimbabwe whites lose special political status.

'''Richard Washburn Child''' (August 5, 1881 &amp;ndash; January 31, 1935) was an American [[author]] and [[diplomat]].

==Early life and career==
Born in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], in 1881, Child went to [[Harvard University]] and [[Harvard Law School|Law School]] where he graduated in 1906 to become a business lawyer. Child founded the Progressive Republican League in Massachusetts, a forerunner of the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party]]. During [[World War I]], he worked first as a correspondent in [[Europe]] and [[Russia]], then for the U.S. Treasury, writing [[propaganda]].

In 1916 he published a book, calling for U.S. investment in Russia. After the war he became editor of ''[[Collier's Weekly]]'' (1919). In 1920 he wrote campaign material for Presidential candidate [[Warren G. Harding]], who rewarded him with the ambassadorship in Italy (from May 1921 to February 1924), where among other diplomatic activities he encouraged [[Benito Mussolini]] to start his [[March on Rome]], as he records in his memoir ''A Diplomat looks at Europe'' (1925).{{dubious|date=November 2012}} He also promoted U.S. investment in Italy under Mussolini, especially from the [[J. P. Morgan]] bank. After his return to the United States, he became editor for ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' and served on the National Crime Commission in 1925. In 1926 he divorced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Richard Washburn Child Sues for Divorce.

In 1928 he became a paid propaganda writer for Benito Mussolini, whose notes he ghostwrote and serialized as [[My Autobiography (Mussolini)|My Autobiography]] in ''The Saturday Evening Post'', and whose politics he praised in numerous articles for the [[Hearst Corporation|Hearst]] press. Together with [[Thomas W. Lamont]] he rates as one of the most influential American promoters of [[Italian Fascism]] until his death in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title= Richard Washburn Child, Author-diplomat Dies  |quote= ... ambassador to Italy and Internationally known publicist, died early today of pneumonia.

Child was a critic of [[spiritualism]] and skeptical of paranormal claims. In his article ''The Will to Believe'' he dismissed the medium [[Eusapia Palladino]] as a fraud.

'''Henry Ross Perot''' ({{IPAc-en|p|ə|ˈ|r|oʊ}}; born June 27, 1930) is an American [[business magnate]] and former politician. As the founder of the successful [[Electronic Data Systems]] corporation, he became a billionaire. He ran an [[Independent (politician)|independent]] [[Ross Perot presidential campaign, 1992|presidential campaign]] in [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992]] and a [[third party (United States)|third party]] [[Ross Perot presidential campaign, 1996|campaign]] in [[United States presidential election, 1996|1996]], establishing the [[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform Party]] in the latter election. Both campaigns were among the strongest [[List of third party performances in United States presidential elections|presidential showings by a third party or independent candidate]] in U.S. history.

Born in [[Texarkana, Texas]], he became a salesman for [[IBM]] after serving in the [[United States Navy]]. In 1962, he founded Electronic Data Systems, a data processing service company. In 1984, [[General Motors]] bought a controlling interest in the company for $2.4 billion. Perot established [[Perot Systems]] in 1988 and was an angel investor for [[NeXT]], a computer company founded by [[Steve Jobs]] after he left Apple. Perot also became heavily involved in the [[Vietnam War POW/MIA issue]], arguing that hundreds of American servicemen were left behind in [[Southeast Asia]] after the [[Vietnam War]]. During President [[George H. W. Bush]]'s tenure, Perot became increasingly active in politics and strongly opposed the [[Gulf War]] and ratification of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]].

In 1992, Perot announced his intention to run for president and advocated a balanced budget, an end to the [[outsourcing]] of jobs, and the enactment of [[e-democracy|electronic direct democracy]]. A June 1992 Gallup poll showed Perot leading a three-way race against President Bush and presumptive Democratic nominee [[Bill Clinton]]. Perot briefly withdrew from the race in July, but re-entered the race in early October after he qualified for all 50 state ballots. He chose Admiral [[James Stockdale]] as his running mate and appeared in the 1992 [[Commission on Presidential Debates|CPD]] debates with Bush and Clinton. In the election, Perot won 18.9% of the popular vote but did not win any electoral votes. He won support from across the ideological and partisan spectrum, but performed best among self-described moderates. Perot ran for president again in 1996, establishing the Reform Party as a vehicle for his campaign. He won 8.4% of the popular vote against President Clinton and Republican nominee [[Bob Dole]].

Perot did not seek public office again after 1996 and did not enter the 2000 [[Reform Party presidential primaries, 2000|Reform Party presidential primaries]]. He endorsed Republican [[George W. Bush]] over Reform nominee [[Pat Buchanan]] in the 2000 election and supported Republican [[Mitt Romney]] in 2008 and 2012. In 2009, [[Dell]] acquired Perot Systems for $3.9 billion. According to ''Forbes'', Perot was the 167th richest person in the United States in 2016.

==Early life==
Perot was born in [[Texarkana, Texas]], the son of Lula May Perot  (née Ray) and Gabriel Ross Perot,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wargs.com/political/perot.html |title=The Ancestors of Ross Perot |publisher=Wargs.com |accessdate=June 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[commodity broker]] specializing in [[cotton]] contracts. His patrilineal line traces back to an immigrant to [[Louisiana (New France)|French Louisiana]] in the 1740s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=8 |first=Gerald |last=Posner |title=Citizen Perot |publisher=Random House |location=New York City |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Danny|last=Reagan|url=http://web.reporternews.com/dannyreagan/perot.html|title=The Perot/Bordelon Branches|accessdate=February 18, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718221004/http://web.reporternews.com/dannyreagan/perot.html |archivedate=July 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended a private school called Patty Hill. He graduated from [[Texas High School]] in Texarkana in 1947.&lt;ref name="TISD"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.txkisd.net/headlines/2009-2010/9%2016%2009%20Texarkana%20Independent%20School%20District%20Names%20H%20%20Ross%20Perot%20as%202009%20Distinguished%20Alumni.pdf |publisher=Texarkana Independent School District |title=Texarkana Independent School District Names H.

Perot joined the [[Boy Scouts of America]] and made [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] in 1942, after 13 months in the program. He is a recipient of the [[Distinguished Eagle Scout Award]].&lt;ref name="honor"&gt;{{cite book |last=Townley |first=Alvin |date=December 26, 2006 |url=http://www.thomasdunnebooks.com/TD_TitleDetail.aspx?ISBN=0312366531| title = Legacy of Honor: The Values and Influence of America's Eagle Scouts |publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York |pages=89–100, 108, 187, 194, 249, 260, 265|isbn=0-312-36653-1 |accessdate=December 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="honor2"&gt;{{cite web |last=Ray |first=Mark |authorlink= |year=2007 |url=http://www.scoutingmagazine.org/issues/0701/a-what.html |title=What It Means to Be an Eagle Scout |work=Scouting Magazine|publisher=Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=January 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1947 to 1949, he attended Texarkana Junior College, then entered the [[U.S. Naval Academy]] in 1949 and helped establish its [[Honor Concept|honor system]].&lt;ref name="honor"/&gt;&lt;ref name=junior&gt;{{cite web|last=The Associated Press|title=Ross Perot Gives $1 Million to Texarkana College|url=http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2012/mar/23/ross-perot-gives-1-million-million-texarkana-colle/|accessdate=April 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perot said his appointment notice to the academy—sent by telegram—was sent by [[W.

After he left the Navy in 1957, Perot became a salesman for [[IBM]].  He quickly became a top employee (one year, he fulfilled his annual sales quota in a mere two weeks)&lt;ref&gt;''Sam Wyly'', 1000 Dollars &amp; an Idea, Publisher: Newmarket, {{ISBN|1-55704-803-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and tried to pitch his ideas to supervisors, who largely ignored him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Landrum|first1=Gene N.|title=Entrepreneurial Genius: The Power of Passion|date=2004|publisher=Brendan Kelly Publishing Inc.|location=Naples, FL|isbn=9781895997231|page=174|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fRdwUrLj2rgC&amp;lpg=PA174&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage|accessdate=December 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left IBM in 1962 to found [[Electronic Data Systems]] (EDS) in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], and courted large corporations for his data processing services.  Perot was refused 77 times before he was given his first contract.  EDS received lucrative contracts from the U.S. government in the 1960s, computerizing [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] records.  EDS [[initial public offering|went public]] in 1968 and the stock price rose from $16 a share to $160 within days.  ''[[Fortune magazine|Fortune]]'' called Perot the "fastest, richest Texan" in a 1968 cover story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ross Perot|url=http://www.famous-entrepreneurs.com/ross-perot|website=Famous Entrepreneurs|accessdate=December 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984 [[General Motors]] bought controlling interest in EDS for $2.4 billion.

In 1974, Perot gained some press attention for being "the biggest individual loser ever on the [[New York Stock Exchange]]" when his EDS shares dropped $450 million in value in a single day in April 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Moscow, "An Astonishment of New York Superlatives: Biggest, Smallest, Longest, Shortest, Oldest, First, Last, Most, Etc." ''New York Magazine'' vol. 7, no. 1 (31 December 1973/7 January 1974) p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

Just prior to the 1979 [[Iranian Revolution]], the government of [[Iran]] imprisoned two EDS employees in a contract dispute. Perot organized and sponsored their rescue.  The rescue team was led by retired [[Special Forces (United States Army)|U.S. Army Special Forces]] [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Arthur D. "Bull" Simons]]. When the team was unable to find a way to extract the two prisoners, they decided to wait for a mob of pro-[[Ruhollah Khomeini|Ayatollah]] revolutionaries to storm the jail and free all 10,000 inmates, many of whom were political prisoners.  The two prisoners then connected with the rescue team, and the team spirited them out of Iran via a risky border crossing into [[Turkey]].  The exploit was recounted in a book, ''[[On Wings of Eagles]]'' by [[Ken Follett]], which became a best-seller. In the [[On Wings of Eagles (TV mini-series)|1986 miniseries]], Perot was portrayed by [[Richard Crenna]].

In 1984, Perot bought a very early copy of [[Magna Carta]], one of only a few to leave the [[United Kingdom]]. It was lent to the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], where it was displayed alongside the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and the [[United States Constitution]].  In 2007, it was sold by the Perot Foundation "for medical research, for improving public education and for assisting wounded soldiers and their families."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/25/nyregion/25magna.html?ex=1348372800&amp;en=4f9b206841ca406c&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink Magna Carta Is Going on the Auction Block], ''[[The New York Times]]''  September 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The document sold for [[United States dollar|US$]]21.3 million on Dec. 18, 2007, to [[David Rubenstein]], managing director of the [[Carlyle Group]], and is kept on display at the National Archives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/19/nyregion/19magna.html|title=Magna Carta Copy Sold|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=April 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Steve Jobs]] lost the original power struggle at Apple and left to found [[NeXT]], his angel investor was Perot, who invested over $20 million.  Perot believed in Jobs and did not want to miss out, as he had with his chance to invest in [[Bill Gates]]'s fledgling [[Microsoft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Isaacson|first=Walter|title=Steve Jobs|year=2011|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York|isbn=1-4516-4853-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, he founded [[Perot Systems|Perot Systems Corporation, Inc.]] in [[Plano, Texas]]. His son, [[Ross Perot Jr.|Ross Perot, Jr.]], eventually succeeded him as CEO. In September 2009, Perot Systems was acquired by Dell for $3.9 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Connie|last1=Guglielmo|first2=Katie|last2=Hoffmann|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid%3D20601103%26sid%3DaMCNzaTRa9oQ|title=Dell Pays 68% Premium for Perot's Health Technology (Update3)|date=September 22, 2009|accessdate=September 22, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603050643/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aMCNzaTRa9oQ |archivedate=June 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political activities==
===Early political activities===
Perot became heavily involved in the [[Vietnam War POW/MIA issue]].  He believed that hundreds of American servicemen were left behind in Southeast Asia at the end of the U.S. involvement in the war,&lt;ref name="nyt062092"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE1DC133FF933A15755C0A964958260 |title=Perot and Senators Seem Headed for a Fight on P.O.W.'s-M.I.A.'s |author=Patrick E.

W. Bush administrations.&lt;ref name="nyt062092"/&gt;&lt;ref name="time062992"/&gt; In 1990, Perot reached agreement with Vietnam's Foreign Ministry to become its business agent in the event that diplomatic relations were normalized.&lt;ref name="nyt060592"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE7DC1F31F936A35755C0A964958260 |title=Perot to Testify in Senate on Americans Missing in Southeast Asia |author=Patrick E.

[[File:Ross Perot Allan Warren.jpg|Perot with a portrait of [[George Washington]] in his office in 1986|thumb|right|200px]]
In [[Florida]] in 1990, retired financial planner [[Jack Gargan (politician)|Jack Gargan]] funded a series of "I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore" (a reference to a famous quotation from the 1976 political and mass media satire movie, ''[[Network (movie)|Network]]'') newspaper advertisements denouncing the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] for voting for legislative pay raises at a time when average wages nationwide were not increasing. Gargan later founded "Throw the Hypocritical Rascals Out" (THRO), which Ross Perot supported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Isikoff|first1=Michael|title=Unlikely Suitors Pushed Perot Bid|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/archive/politics/1992/05/31/unlikely-suitors-pushed-perot-bid/bc22e3e3-16b5-4d87-a852-2277c6d26952/?resType=accessibility&amp;nid=menu_nav_accessibilityforscreenreader|accessdate=December 28, 2015|agency=Washington Post|publisher=Washington Post|date=May 31, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perot did not support President [[George H. W. Bush]], and vigorously opposed the United States' involvement in the 1990–1991 [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]]. He unsuccessfully urged Senators to vote against the war resolution, and began to consider his own presidential run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 1992 Run For The Presidency|url=http://cgi.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/conventions/long.beach/perot/political.fray.shtml|publisher=Reform Party|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140131132826/http://cgi.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/conventions/long.beach/perot/political.fray.shtml|archivedate=January 31, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wait&gt;{{cite news|last=QUINDLEN|first=Anna|title=Public &amp; Private; Waiting for Perot|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/03/opinion/public-private-waiting-for-perot.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=November 13, 2012|date=June 3, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1992 presidential campaign===
{{Main|Ross Perot presidential campaign, 1992}}
[[File:RossPerotColor.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Perot in 1986]]
On February 20, 1992, he appeared on [[CNN]]'s ''[[Larry King Live]]'' and announced his intention to run as an independent if his supporters could get his name on the ballot in all 50 states. With such declared policies as balancing the [[Balanced Budget Amendment|federal budget]], opposition to gun control, ending the [[outsourcing]] of jobs and enacting [[e-democracy|electronic direct democracy]] via "electronic [[town meeting|town halls]],” he became a potential candidate and soon polled roughly even with the two major party candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://people-press.org/report/19920616/year-of-the-outsider |title=The Pew Research Center for People &amp; the Press: Year of the Outsider |date=June 16, 1992 |accessdate=October 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perot's candidacy received increasing media attention when the competitive phase of the primary season ended for the two major parties. With the insurgent candidacies of Republican [[Pat Buchanan]] and Democrat [[Jerry Brown]] winding down, Perot was the natural beneficiary of populist resentment toward establishment politicians. On May 25, 1992, he was featured on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' with the title "Waiting for Perot", an allusion to [[Samuel Beckett]]'s play ''[[Waiting for Godot]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19920525,00.html |title=''Time'' magazine cover: H. Ross Perot|date=May 25, 1992|accessdate=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several months before the Democratic and Republican conventions, Perot filled the vacuum of election news, as his supporters began petition drives to get him on the ballot in all 50 states. This sense of momentum was reinforced when Perot employed two savvy campaign managers in Democrat [[Hamilton Jordan]] and Republican [[Ed Rollins]]. In July, while Perot was pondering whether to run for office, his supporters established a campaign organization [[United We Stand America]]. Perot was late in making formal policy proposals, but most of what he did call for were intended to reduce the deficit, such as a [[gasoline tax]] increase and cutbacks to [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

In June, Perot led a Gallup poll with 39% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/11/us/the-1992-campaign-on-the-trail-poll-gives-perot-a-clear-lead.html|title=THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: On the Trail; POLL GIVES PEROT A CLEAR LEAD|date=June 11, 1992|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=October 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By mid-July, the ''[[Washington Post]]'' reported that Perot's campaign managers were becoming increasingly disillusioned by his unwillingness to follow their advice to be more specific on issues,&lt;ref name="milwaukee"/&gt; and his need to be in full control of operations&lt;ref name="milwaukee"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Jd8VAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5420,3383510&amp;dq=ross-perot|title=Perot advisers reportedly at odds|date=July 14, 1992|work=[[The Milwaukee Sentinel]]|page=2A|accessdate=May 27, 2010|location=Milwaukee, Wisconsin}}&lt;/ref&gt; with such tactics as forcing volunteers to sign [[loyalty oath]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Perot asks volunteers to sign loyalty oaths|date=July 14, 1992|work=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|agency=Associated Press|page=2A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perot's poll numbers began to slip to 25%, and his advisers warned that if he continued to ignore them, he would fall into single digits. Co-manager Hamilton Jordan threatened to quit, and on July 15, Ed Rollins resigned after Perot fired advertisement specialist Hal Riney, who worked with Rollins on the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] campaign. Rollins would later claim that a member of the campaign accused him of being a Bush plant with ties to the [[CIA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/02/opinion/abroad-at-home-why-perot.html?pagewanted=1|title=Abroad at Home; Why Perot?|last=Lewis|first=Anthony|date=October 2, 1992|work=The New York Times|page=31|accessdate=May 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amid the chaos, Perot's support fell to 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/16/news/campaign-ross-perot-rollins-quits-perot-s-campaign-asserts-his-advice-was.html|title=Rollins Quits Perot's Campaign; Asserts His Advice Was Ignored|last=Holmes|first=Steven A.|date=July 16, 1992|work=The New York Times|page=1|accessdate=May 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, Perot announced on ''Larry King Live'' that he would not seek the presidency. He explained that he did not want the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] to decide the election if the result caused the [[electoral college]] to be split. Perot eventually stated the reason was that he received threats that digitally altered photographs would be released by the Bush campaign to sabotage his daughter's wedding.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/26/us/1992-campaign-overview-perot-says-he-quit-july-thwart-gop-dirty-tricks.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Overview; PEROT SAYS HE QUIT IN JULY TO THWART G.O.P.

In September, he qualified for all 50 state ballots. On October 1, he announced his intention to re-enter the presidential race. He campaigned in 16 states and spent an estimated $12.3 million of his own money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Clymer |first=Adam |title=THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Perot Gave $12 Million to Aborted Campaign |work=[[New York Times]] |date=August 25, 1992 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/25/us/the-1992-campaign-ross-perot-perot-gave-12-million-to-aborted-campaign.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perot employed the innovative strategy of purchasing half-hour blocks of time on major networks for [[infomercial]]-type campaign advertisements; this advertising garnered more viewership than many sitcoms, with one Friday night program in October attracting 10.5 million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Media; Perot's 30-Minute TV Ads Defy the Experts, Again |page=A.19 |last=Kolbert |first= Elizabeth |work=New York Times |date=October 27, 1992 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/27/nyregion/the-1992-campaign-the-media-perot-s-30-minute-tv-ads-defy-the-experts-again.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At one point in June, Perot led the polls with 39% (versus 31% for Bush and 25% for Clinton). Just prior to the debates, Perot received 7–9% support in nationwide polls.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE7DB133EF932A25755C0A964958260 THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: On the Trail; POLL GIVES PEROT A CLEAR LEAD]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. New York, N.Y.: June 11, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; The debates likely played a significant role in his ultimate receipt of 19% of the popular vote. Although his answers during the debates were often general, many Democrats and Republicans conceded that Perot won at least the first debate. In the debate, he remarked:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Keep in mind our Constitution predates the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Our founders did not know about electricity, the train, telephones, radio, television, automobiles, airplanes, rockets, nuclear weapons, satellites, or space exploration. There's a lot they didn't know about. It would be interesting to see what kind of document they'd draft today. Just keeping it frozen in time won't hack it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sumner |first=Mark |url=http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2009/4/19/720644/-All-This-Has-Happened-Before |title=All This Has Happened Before |publisher=Daily Kos |date=April 19, 2009 |accessdate=June 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Perot denounced Congress for its inaction in his speech at the National Press Club in Washington, DC, on March 18, 1992. Perot said:{{quote|This city has become a town filled with [[Soundbite|sound bites]], [[shell game]]s, handlers, media stuntmen who posture, create images, talk, shoot off [[Roman candle (firework)|Roman candles]], but don't ever accomplish anything. We need deeds, not words, in this city.&lt;ref&gt;Perot, Ross, James W. Robinson.

In the [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992 election]], he received 18.9% of the popular vote, about 19,741,065 votes (but no [[United States Electoral College|electoral college]] votes), making him the most successful third-party presidential candidate in terms of the popular vote since [[Theodore Roosevelt]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1912|1912 election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.270towin.com/1912_Election/ |title=Presidential Election of 1912 |website=270towin.com |date= |accessdate=April 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Perot, however, some other third party candidates since Roosevelt have won electoral college votes. ([[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.|Robert La Follette]] had 13 in 1924, [[Strom Thurmond]] had 39 in 1948, [[George Wallace]] had 46 in 1968 and [[John Hospers]] won one in 1972, albeit from a [[faithless elector]]). Compared with Thurmond and Wallace, who polled very strongly in a small number of states, Perot's vote was more evenly spread across the country. Perot managed to finish second in two states: In [[Maine]], Perot received 30.44% of the vote to Bush's 30.39% (Clinton won Maine with 38.77%); in [[Utah]], Perot received 27.34% of the vote to Clinton's 24.65% (Bush won Utah with 43.36%). Although Perot did not win a state, he received the most votes in some counties, including [[Trinity County, California]].

A detailed analysis of voting demographics revealed that Perot's support drew heavily from across the political spectrum, with 20% of his votes coming from self-described [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberals]], 27% from self-described [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]], and 53% coming from self-described [[moderate]]s. Economically, however, the majority of Perot voters (57%) were middle class, earning between $15,000 and $49,000 annually, with the bulk of the remainder drawing from the upper middle class (29% earning more than $50,000 annually).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=''Politics: Who Cares''|author1=Peirce Lewis|author2=Casey McCracken|author3=Roger Hunt|journal=American Demographics|date=October 1994|volume=16|page=23|url=http://www.hks.harvard.edu/case/3pt/perot_vote.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exit polls also showed that Ross Perot drew 38% of his vote from Bush, and 38% of his vote from Clinton, though it's generally considered that he aided Clinton in defeating Bush.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE0DB1F3FF936A35752C1A964958260 |work=The New York Times |title=THE 1992 ELECTIONS: DISAPPOINTMENT -- NEWS ANALYSIS An Eccentric but No Joke; Perot's Strong Showing Raises Questions On What Might Have Been, and Might Be |first=Steven A. |last=Holmes |date=November 5, 1992 |accessdate=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on his performance in the popular vote in 1992, Perot was entitled to receive federal election funding for 1996. Perot remained in the public eye after the election and championed opposition to the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), urging voters to listen for the "[[giant sucking sound]]" of American jobs heading south to [[Mexico]] should NAFTA be ratified.

===Reform Party and 1996 presidential campaign===
Perot tried to keep his movement alive through the mid-1990s, continuing to speak about the increasing national debt. He was a prominent campaigner against the NAFTA, and even debated with then Vice President [[Al Gore]] on the issue on ''Larry King Live''. Perot's behavior during the debate was a source of mirth thereafter, including his repeated pleas to "let me finish" in his southern drawl. The debate was seen by many as effectively ending Perot's political career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/10/03/debate.games.tm/index.html|title=Bush plays off expectations; Gore learns from mistakes|accessdate=August 14, 2008|last=Reaves|first=Jessica|author2=Frank Pelligrini|date=October 3, 2000|publisher=[[cnn.com]]|quote=Gore's decisive victory was the saving of NAFTA and the beginning of the end of Perot as even a semi-serious public figure.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915033715/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/10/03/debate.games.tm/index.html|archivedate=September 15, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Support for NAFTA went from 34% to 57%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://entertainment.time.com/2010/12/16/top-10-larry-king-moments/slide/al-gore-and-ross-perot-debate-nafta |title=Al Gore and Ross Perot Debate NAFTA |last=Tharoor |first=Ishaan|date=December 15, 2010|work=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, he founded the [[United States Reform Party|Reform Party]] and won their presidential nomination for the [[U.S. presidential election, 1996|1996 election]]. His vice presidential running mate was [[Pat Choate]]. Because of the ballot access laws, he had to run as an Independent on many state ballots. Perot received 8% of the popular vote in 1996, lower than in the 1992 race, but still an unusually successful third-party showing by U.S. standards. He spent much less of his own money in this race than he had four years before, and also allowed other people to contribute to his campaign, unlike his prior race. One common explanation for the decline was Perot's exclusion from the [[American presidential debate|presidential debates]], based on the preferences of the Democratic and Republican party candidates. [[Jamie Raskin|Jamin B. Raskin]] of ''Open Debates'' filed a lawsuit about Perot's exclusion years later.&lt;ref name=od&gt;{{cite web|title=Open Debates: Board of Directors|url=http://www.opendebates.org/aboutus/boardofdirectors.html|publisher=Opendebates.org|accessdate=November 13, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053730/http://www.opendebates.org/aboutus/boardofdirectors.html|archivedate=September 21, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cbsdeb&gt;{{cite web|last=Richards|first=Paul J.|title=Do the debates unfairly shut out third parties?|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57531685/do-the-debates-unfairly-shut-out-third-parties/|publisher=CBS news}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later activities===
[[File:Ross Perot - 2009 Eagle Bank Bowl.jpg|thumb|left|Perot attending the [[2009 EagleBank Bowl]] in Washington, D.C.]]
Later in the 1990s, Perot's detractors accused him of not allowing the Reform Party to develop into a genuine national political party, but rather using it as a vehicle to promote himself. They cited as evidence the control of party offices by operatives from his presidential campaigns. Perot did not give an endorsement during [[Jesse Ventura]]'s run for [[governor of Minnesota]] in the 1998 election, and this became suspicious to detractors when he made fun of Ventura at a conference after Ventura had a falling out with the press. The party leadership grew in tighter opposition to groups supporting Ventura and Jack Gargan. Evidence of this was demonstrated when Gargan was officially removed as Reform Party chairman by the Reform Party National Committee.

In the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]], Perot refused to become openly involved with the internal Reform Party dispute between supporters of [[Pat Buchanan]] and [[John Hagelin]]. Perot was reportedly unhappy with what he saw as the disintegration of the party, as well as his own portrayal in the press; thus, he chose to remain quiet. He appeared on ''Larry King Live'' four days before the election and endorsed George W. Bush for president. Despite his earlier opposition to NAFTA, Perot remained largely silent about expanded use of guest-worker visas in the United States, with Buchanan supporters attributing this silence to his corporate reliance on foreign workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buchanan.org/db00-0524.html|title=Perot: H1Bs and PNTR -- The Giant Silence|publisher=Buchanan.org|date=May 24, 2000|accessdate=October 20, 2004|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000816031327/http://www.buchanan.org/db00-0524.html|archivedate=August 16, 2000|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some state parties affiliated with the new (Buchananite) [[America First Party (2002)|America First Party]].

[[File:Perot.jpg|thumb|Perot speaking in 2006]]
Since then, Perot has been largely silent on political issues, refusing to answer most questions from the press. When interviewed, he usually remains on the subject of his business career and refuses to answer specific questions on politics, candidates, or his past activities.

One exception to this came in 2005, when he was asked to testify before the [[Texas Legislature]] in support of proposals to extend technology to students, including making laptops available to them. He also supported changing the process of buying textbooks by making [[e-books]] available and by allowing schools to buy books at the local level instead of going through the state. In an April 2005 interview, Perot expressed concern about the state of progress on issues that he had raised in his presidential runs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/opinion/points/stories/042405dnediperot.3af4b33e.html |title=Point of Contact: H.

Two further exceptions came with his endorsements in the 2008 and 2012 elections. In January 2008, Perot publicly came out against Republican candidate [[John McCain]] and endorsed [[Mitt Romney]] for president.  He also announced that he would soon be launching a new website with updated economic graphs and charts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/94827 |title=Ross Perot Slams McCain|work=Newsweek|date=January 16, 2008 |accessdate=June 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In June 2008, this blog launched, focusing on [[entitlement]]s (Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security), the U.S. national debt, and related issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url =http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/06/19/perot.charts/|title=Ross Perot wants more focus on national debt|author=Jason Carroll|publisher=CNN |date = June 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Perot endorsed Romney for president again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dinan|first=Stephen|title=Ross Perot endorses Mitt Romney|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/blog/inside-politics/2012/oct/16/ross-perot-endorses-mitt-romney/|work=The Washington Times|accessdate=October 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perot did not give any endorsements for the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 election]].

==Political views==
During Perot's political campaigns, he spoke less on social issues and instead focused on the fiscal issues of the time. Perot did not fit the typical stereotype of a conservative southerner, his views were seen as liberal and usually focused on his economic policy to keep support during his campaigns and gain support from both Democrats and Republican voters from his home state of [[Texas]]. Perot is [[Abortion-rights movements|pro-choice]], supports [[LGBT rights in the United States|gay rights]], stricter gun controls such as an [[assault rifle]] ban and increased research in [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Celeb/Ross_Perot_Gun_Control.htm|title=Ross Perot on Gun Control|website=www.ontheissues.org|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Celeb/Ross_Perot_Health_Care.htm|title=Ross Perot on Health Care|last=|first=|date=|website=OnTheIssues|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Celeb/Ross_Perot_Civil_Rights.htm|title=Ross Perot on Civil Rights|last=|first=|date=|website=OnTheIssues|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social issues===
Since 1992, Perot was a pro-choice activist, and a strong supporter of [[Planned Parenthood]]. He has stated poorer women in particular should have access to abortions via federal funding. Since 2000, he has been pro-choice reluctantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Celeb/Ross_Perot_Abortion.htm|title=Ross Perot on Abortion|website=www.ontheissues.org|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic policy===
Perot believes tax should be increased on the wealthy, while spending should be cut to help pay off the national debt. Perot also believes capital gains tax should be increased, while giving tax breaks to those starting new businesses.

{{Quote|text="We cut the capital gains tax rate from a maximum rate of 35% to a maximum rate that got as low as 20% during the 1980s. Who got the benefit? The rich did, of course, because that's who owns most of the capital assets."|sign=|source=Not For Sale at Any Price}}

In his book, Perot showed support for giving tax cuts for [[Small and medium-sized enterprises|SME's]], as opposed to larger corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/At_Any_Price.htm|title=Not For Sale at Any Price, by Ross Perot|website=www.ontheissues.org|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Perot has supported a [[balanced budget]] amendment, stating: "spending should not exceed revenue for 27 consecutive years." On trade, Perot has stated that there is a trade deficit between Mexico and the U.S. and a loss of manufacturing jobs which he believes is caused by [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Celeb/Ross_Perot_Free_Trade.htm|title=Ross Perot on Free Trade|last=|first=|date=|website=OnTheIssues|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His position on Free Trade and NAFTA became his defining campaign principles of both the 1992 and 1996 presidential elections.
Ross Perot argued:
We have got to stop sending jobs overseas. It's pretty simple: If you're paying $12, $13, $14 an hour for factory workers and you can move your factory South of the border, pay a dollar an hour for labor, ... have no health care—that's the most expensive single element in making a car— have no environmental controls, no pollution controls and no retirement, and you don't care about anything but making money, there will be a giant sucking sound going south.
    ... when [Mexico's] jobs come up from a dollar an hour to six dollars an hour, and ours go down to six dollars an hour, and then it's leveled again. But in the meantime, you've wrecked the country with these kinds of deals. Ross forecasted a future of lost jobs and a dwindling of the middle class decades before it materialize. Today in 2018 Americans are experiencing this wrecked economy in inner city America and small town America.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2011}}
The Slovenian Democratic Party has developed from the merger of two distinct political parties, being the legal successor of both of the [[Social Democratic Union of Slovenia]] and the [[Slovenian Democratic Union]], two of the most influential parties of the [[Democratic Opposition of Slovenia]]—also known as the DEMOS coalition—which defeated the former [[Communist Party of Slovenia]] in the first open Slovenian election on April 1990, and carried out the [[democratization]] of Slovenia and its [[History of Slovenia#Disintegration of Yugoslavia|secession from Yugoslavia]]. The Social Democratic Union of Slovenia had emerged from an independent, [[Anti-communism|anti-Communist]] trade union movement in the late 1980s. Its first president was the trade union leader [[France Tomšič]], who in December 1987 organized the [[Litostroj strike|first successful large-scale workers strike]] in [[Communist Slovenia]], following the example of [[Lech Wałęsa]]'s [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] movement in [[Poland]]. Tomšič however resigned soon after the founding of the party, endorsing the leadership of [[Jože Pučnik]], a former dissident who had been forced to emigrate to Germany in the 1960s. Under Pučnik's leadership, The Social Democratic Union of Slovenia gradually developed into a moderate [[social democracy|social-democratic]] party, which combined the plea for a [[social market economy]] with the support of a [[welfare state]] based on a [[German model|German]], [[Economy of Austria|Austrian]] and [[Scandinavian welfare model|Scandinavian]] social model.

The Slovenian Democratic Union, on the other hand, was founded in January 1989, as opposition to the [[Communist Party of Slovenia]], emphasizing establishment of the [[rule of law]] and respect for [[human rights]] and fundamental political freedoms, respect for [[minority rights]], and the inclusion of Slovenia in the Euro-Atlantic integrations (the [[European Union]] and [[NATO]]). It functioned as a broad but somehow fragmented coalition of several groups with different [[liberalism|liberal]], [[social liberalism|social-liberal]] and [[civic nationalism|civic nationalist]] agendas.

In 1992, the Slovenian Democratic Union split into two parties: the [[social liberalism|social-liberal]] wing established the [[Democratic Party (Slovenia)|Democratic Party]] (DSS), while the [[conservatism|conservative]] faction founded the [[National Democratic Party (Slovenia)|National Democratic Party]] (NDS). Members who did not join one of these two parties decided to join the Social Democratic Party led by [[Jože Pučnik]]. Although the Social Democratic Party suffered a clear defeat in the 1992 election, barely securing its entry in the [[Slovenian National Assembly|Parliament]], it formed a coalition with the winning [[Liberal Democracy of Slovenia]] (LDS) and entered the cabinet of [[Janez Drnovšek]].

In 1995, the [[National Democratic Party (Slovenia)|National Democratic Party]] joined the party, which thus became one of the legal successors of the [[Slovenian Democratic Union]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

After the year 2000, the party applied for membership in the [[European People's Party]] (EPP), adopting a [[economic liberalism|liberal]] economic policy and later pro-[[austerity]] measures upon the late-2000 economic crisis, while retaining an [[atlanticism|atlantist]] foreign policy.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

=== Radical populist turn ===
Upon being dismissed by Prime Minister Janez Drnovšek because of being involved in the attempts of the military interfering in civilian justice, the party's leader became [[Janez Janša]], while Jože Pučnik resigned and became the honorary president of the party (a function he held until his death in January 2003). Janša was subsequently cleared, following an inquiry. The party unconditionally supported its new leader and decided to leave the coalition and stayed in opposition for the next ten years (except for a short period in 2000, when it entered a short-lived centre-right government led by [[Andrej Bajuk]]), in the meantime gaining in popularity among &amp;ndash; as described by one of its [[Slovenian Democratic Party#Former supporters|former supporters]], [[Peter Jambrek]] &amp;ndash; "lower, frustrated social strata".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnevnik.si/clanek/1042482825 Peter Jambrek o tem, da je SDS stranka frustriranih nižjih slojev], Dnevnik, 25. Cctober 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The party's [[Political radicalism|radical]] [[populism]], [[nationalism|nationalistic]]&lt;ref name="HlousekKopecek"/&gt; and [[xenophobia|xenophobic]] rhetoric was noticed also by political scientists.&lt;ref name="Rizman"&gt;{{Citation |first=Rudolf M. |last=Rizman |title=Radical Right Politics in Slovenia |work=The radical right in Central and Eastern Europe since 1989 |publisher=Penn State Press |year=1999 |pages=155–162 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QZr1vsDIvlUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=de&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=slovenian%20democratic%20party&amp;f=false |accessdate=14 November}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first1=Ian |last1=Hall |first2=Magali |last2=Perrault |title=The Re-Austrianisation of Central Europe? |journal=Central Europe Review |volume=2 |number=13 |date=3 April 2000 |url=http://www.ce-review.org/00/13/essay13.html |accessdate=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Rudolf M. |last=Rizman |title=Uncertain path: Democratic transition and consolidation in Slovenia |publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press |year=2006 |page=74 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0F5l-gI0_igC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=de&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=slovenian%20democratic%20party%20jansa&amp;f=false |accessdate=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the local Slovenian [[Catholic Church]] supported it more than any other Slovenian political party. Even though not a nominally Christian party, the local church has stood fully and unconditionally behind it.&lt;ref name="Rizman"/&gt;

=== 2004–2008: in power (first Janša Cabinet) ===
On 3 October 2004, SDS won the [[Slovenian parliamentary election, 2004|2004 parliamentary election]] with 29.1% of the popular vote and 29 out of 88 seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dvk-rs.si/arhivi/dz2004/en/index.htm|title=Republic of Slovenia Elections for Deputies to the National Assembly 2004|website=www.dvk-rs.si|access-date=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; SDS then formed [[Cabinet of Janez Janša I|a coalition]] with [[New Slovenia]] (NSi), the [[Slovenian People's Party]] (SLS), and [[Democratic Party of Pensioners of Slovenia]] (DeSUS), holding a total of 49 parliamentary seats (out of 90).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rtvslo.si/volitve-v-dz/pregled-mandata-2004-2005/90806|title=Pregled mandata 2004/2005|work=Prvi interaktivni multimedijski portal, MMC RTV Slovenija|access-date=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SDS-led government passed several pro-business measures, initiated the [[regionalisation]] of the country by giving more power to local governments, and, in order to please its coalition party, DeSUS - introduced economically non-sustainable changes in the pension system.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

SDS has been accused of catering to the interests of the Slovenian [[Roman Catholic Church]] in exchange for political support.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mladina.si/92559/katoliska-drzava-drzavna-cerkev/|title=Katoliška država, državna cerkev {{!}} MLADINA.si|work=Mladina.si|access-date=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the Church maintained a critical attitude towards some of the party's positions (the SDS-led Government has assumed a favourable attitude towards [[gambling]] tourism, [[Embryonic stem cell|stem cell]] research and passed a law recognizing [[Civil unions in Slovenia|same-sex civil unions]], all opposed by the Roman Catholic Church).{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==== Internal affairs ====
The government introduced measures to supervise, and to curtail the powers of the [[Slovenian Intelligence and Security Agency]]. The measures were strongly rebuked by the opposition and segments of the press as an attempt to discredit the secret intelligence service and cast a negative shadow on the policies of previous governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mladina.si/92630/specialna-vojna/|title=Specialna vojna {{!}} MLADINA.si|work=Mladina.si|access-date=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.delo.si/novice/slovenija/komisiji-za-nadzor-sove-omejen-nadzor-v-tekocih-zadevah.html|title=Komisiji za nadzor Sove omejen nadzor v tekočih zadevah|last=Uredništvo|access-date=2018-06-03|language=sl-si}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Freedom of the press violations ====
The first SDS government was the target of widespread criticism due to allegations of meddling in the independence of the press.&lt;ref name=":35"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/04/world/europe/viktor-orban-media-slovenia.html|title=Safe in Hungary, Viktor Orban Pushes His Message Across Europe|date=2018-06-04|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-06-05|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first SDS government has been accused of politicising the independent press by appointing political allies&lt;ref name=":39"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/europe-populists-right-wing-success-marine-le-pen-viktor-orban-italy-slovenia-a8382766.html|title=The right-wing populists doing well across Europe, from Marine Le Pen to Viktor Orban|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; to leadership and journalist positioned in the state [[Slovenian Press Agency]],&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; daily newspaper [[Delo]],&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mladina.si/?__rewriter=1&amp;id=108659&amp;|title=J.

The petition accused premier Janša of limiting press freedom in particular, but was aimed against all infringements against press freedom by either government, political actors in general, or media company owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mladina.si/75880/04-10-2007-peticija_zoper_cenzuro_in_politicne_pritiske_na_novinarje_v_sloveniji/|title=Peticija zoper cenzuro in politične pritiske na novinarje v Sloveniji {{!}} MLADINA.si|work=Mladina.si|access-date=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dnevnik.si/271330|title=Slovenski novinarji zoper cenzuro|work=Dnevnik|access-date=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Press Institute]] voiced support for the petition and called on the government to create an independent body to investigate the claims of media influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dnevnik.si/272383|title=Mednarodni novinarski inštitut poziva k preiskavi političnih pritiskov na slovenske medije|work=Dnevnik|access-date=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SDS rejected accusations of impropriety, claiming the media was in fact controlled by leftist opposition groups.&lt;ref name=":35" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dnevnik.si/285888|title=Jože Tanko (SDS): Nekatere medije nadzira Borut Pahor|work=Dnevnik|access-date=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Economy and finance ====
The first [[Cabinet of Janez Janša I|Cabinet of Janez Janša]] oversaw a period of rapid economic growth. GDP grew by nearly 5% between 2004 and 2006, reaching nearly 7% growth in 2007,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; making it the fastest-growing eurozone member for that year.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-slovenia-pm/slovenia-parliament-confirms-jansa-as-prime-minister-idUSTRE80R0L720120128|title=Slovenia parliament confirms Jansa as prime minister|last=Novak|first=Marja|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-06-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The economic boom, however, was highly dependent on private debt, particularly corporate debt.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The Ministry of Finance, headed by [[Andrej Bajuk]], passed comprehensive tax reform, lowering corporate taxes and taxes on juridical persons, and the tax burden on individual incomes, flattening income tax margin progression, and simplifying the tax code. It oversaw the implementation of the Euro, privatisation of state-owned NKBM bank, lowering public expenditure, and increasing budget surpluses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dnevnik.si/337210|title=Dosežki ministrstva za finance po Bajuku: Davčna reforma, uvedba evra, predsedovanje EU, privatizacija NKBM in znižanje javne porabe|work=Dnevnik|access-date=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2008–2011: in opposition ===
In the [[Slovenian parliamentary election, 2008|2008 parliamentary election]] (held on 21 September 2008) narrowly lost against the [[Social Democrats (Slovenia)|Social Democrats]], until then the main opposition party. It also lost one seat in Slovenian Parliament, falling to 28.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dvk-rs.si/index.php/si/arhiv-drzavni-zbor-rs/leto-2008|title=Državni zbor RS - Leto 2008 {{!}} Državna volilna komisija|website=Državna volilna komisija|access-date=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the election of the Social Democrat leader [[Borut Pahor]] as Prime Minister of Slovenia, the Slovenian Democratic Party officially declared it would stay in opposition and form a [[shadow cabinet]]. The shadow government was formed in late December 2008, and it includes several independent members as well as members from other conservative parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sta.si/vest.php?s=s&amp;id=1349433 |title=STA: SDS ustanovila strokovni svet |publisher=Sta.si |date=2008-12-23 |accessdate=2014-07-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714152831/http://www.sta.si/vest.php?s=s&amp;id=1349433 |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (Slovenia)|2009 European election]], the SDS was the most popular party in Slovenia with 26.9% of votes, more than eight points ahead of the second-most popular party, the ruling Social Democrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dvk-rs.si/index.php/si/arhiv-evropski-parlament/leto-2009|title=Volitve v Evropski parlament - Leto 2009 {{!}} Državna volilna komisija|website=Državna volilna komisija|access-date=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the MP [[Franc Pukšič]] left the Slovenian Democratic Party and joined the [[Slovenian People's Party]]; the SDS parliamentary group was thus reduced from 28 to 27 MPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rtvslo.si/slovenija/franc-puksic-iz-sds-a-v-sls/213371|title=Franc Pukšič iz SDS-a v SLS?|work=Prvi interaktivni multimedijski portal, MMC RTV Slovenija|access-date=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2012–2013: a year in power (second Janša Cabinet) ===
In the [[Slovenian parliamentary election, 2011|2011 snap parliamentary election]] (held on 4 December after the centre-left governing coalition collapsed due to internal conflict and inefficacy in passing meaningful economic reforms), SDS won 26.19% of the vote, gaining 26 seats in the [[National Assembly (Slovenia)|National Assembly]], thus making SDS the second-largest parliamentary party after the newly formed [[centre-left]] party, [[Positive Slovenia]] (PS) (headed by Ljubljana mayor [[Zoran Janković (politician)|Zoran Janković]]), which won 28 MPs (28.5% of the total).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sloveniatimes.com/exit-poll-jankovic-wins-the-elections/2|title=Positive Slovenia Surprise Winner of Election|website=www.sloveniatimes.com|language=sl|access-date=2018-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-slovenia-pm/slovenia-parliament-confirms-jansa-as-prime-minister-idUSTRE80R0L720120128|title=Slovenia parliament confirms Jansa as prime minister|last=Novak|first=Marja|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-06-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Slovenia/Government-and-society#ref1007089|title=Slovenia - Government and society|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-06-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, SDS succeeded in forming a ruling [[Cabinet of Janez Janša II|four-party coalition government]] (which included the [[Civic List (Slovenia)|Civic List]], [[New Slovenia]], [[Slovenian People's Party]], and [[Democratic Party of Pensioners of Slovenia]]) (holding a combined total of 50 out of 90 parliamentary seats) some two months after the election after PS failed to form a coalition with a parliamentary majority. The coalition took power amid an alarming economic downturn ([[European debt crisis]]),&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; the worst in the independent country's history.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}  The country's economic woes were further exacerbated by credit agencies' lowering of Slovenia's credit rating amid the political tumult.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The coalition, headed by SDS, undertook drastic economic and financial reforms in an attempt to halt the economic downturn.

The SDS-led government proved impotent in stemming the economic troubles facing the nation.

Janša reportedly made such ominous claims for political purposes as means of solidifying political power and as a negotiating strategy to strengthen his hand during negotiations with public sector unions. The PM's eerie pronouncements were taken at face value by foreign observers, however, creating a self-fulfilling feedback loop where gloomy statements made by top Slovene officials created more panic and dismay in the foreign press and various organisations, and vice versa, resulting in falling credit ratings and asset prices, and excessive capital injections/bailouts with funds borrowed at excessively high interest rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mladina.si/176754/kdo-je-pokopal-slovenijo/|title=Kdo je pokopal Slovenijo? {{!}} MLADINA.si|work=Mladina.si|access-date=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Janša also faced graft charges even before ascending to the premiership in 2012. He was one of the defendants being tried for corruption as result of a [[Patria case|2006 bribery scandal]] involving charges of accepting kickbacks to fund his party's electoral campaign.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://euobserver.com/investigations/123961|title=[Investigation] Arms deals and bribes: The downfall of Slovenia's former PM|access-date=2018-06-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a campaign largely based on anti-immigration populist rhetoric, SDS topped public opinion polls heading into the 2018 parliamentary election.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The incendiary electoral campaign sparked a rally under the title "Without Fear — Against the Politics of Hatred", with some 2,000-3,000 heart-shaped balloon-carrying marchers in attendance.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vecer.com/spremljamo-v-ljubljani-protest-proti-sirjenju-sovrastva-6484656|title=(VIDEO in FOTO) Več tisoč ljudi na shodu proti politiki sovraštva|work=Časnik Večer d.o.o.|access-date=2018-06-07|language=sl-si}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://siol.net/novice/slovenija/protest-v-ljubljani-sejanje-strahu-sovraznost-in-lazi-vodi-v-totalitarizem-foto-469020|title=Protest v Ljubljani: "Sejanje strahu, sovražnosti in laži vodi v totalitarizem" #foto|access-date=2018-06-07|language=sl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2018 electoral campaign, SDS also begun to send postable questionnaires ("voter consults") to Slovene households. The questionnaires contained loaded questions and proposals (e.g. "... Do you support SDS's proposal that the healthcare system be set in order?"). The effort was apparently part of the party's electoral campaign, and likely fashioned on Hungarian "national consultations", which the country's ruling party has practiced for years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mladina.si/185151/posvetovanje-s-prevaro/|title=Posvetovanje s prevaro  {{!}} MLADINA.si|work=Mladina.si|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://vezjak.com/2018/05/28/dilema-izsiljene-izbire-ste-za-bozicnico/|title=Dilema izsiljene izbire: »Ste za božičnico?«|date=2018-05-28|work=::: IN MEDIA RES :::|access-date=2018-06-10|language=sl-SI}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/76ce19e4-a768-11e7-93c5-648314d2c72c|title=Subscribe to read|website=Financial Times|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Janša declared he would be willing to relinquish his post as PM designate to some other SDS MP if this would ease tensions and enable SDS to form a coalition government. The second largest party, the [[List of Marjan Šarec]], said it had already started informal talks to form a coalition excluding SDS days after the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-slovenia-government/slovenias-president-to-give-mandate-to-anti-immigrant-party-to-form-government-idUSKCN1J31SI|title=Slovenia's president to give mandate to anti-immigrant party to...|last=Novak|first=Marja|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-06-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some two weeks after the 2018 election, Janša again met with Hungarian PM Orban during a private visit in Budapest.

== Ideology ==
=== Populism ===
During the [[European migrant crisis]], SDS sharply intensified its nationalist populist rhetoric.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/01/drain-the-swamp-rightwing-leader-pulls-ahead-in-slovenias-polls|title='Drain the swamp': rightwing leader pulls ahead in Slovenia's polls|last=MacDowall|first=Andrew|date=2018-06-01|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.euronews.com/2018/06/01/explained-slovenia-s-elections-and-orban-s-populist-influence|title=Explained: Slovenia's election and Orban's populist influence|date=2018-06-01|work=euronews|access-date=2018-06-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/03/world/europe/slovenia-election.html|title=Slovenia Elections Tilt Another European Country to the Right|date=2018-06-03|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-06-04|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party came out in opposition of migrant quotas and advocated shifting resources from non-governmental organisations to increase security spending.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-slovenia-election/anti-immigrant-stance-helps-slovenias-sds-party-to-poll-lead-idUSKCN1IN1QU|title=Anti-immigrant stance helps Slovenia's SDS party to poll lead|last=Novak|first=Marja|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-06-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Janša furthermore lambasted the "degenerate left".&lt;ref name=":30"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.delo.si/sobotna/najprej-slovenija-kaj-pa-potem.html|title=Najprej Slovenija.

=== Domestic policy ===
==== Economic policy ====
SDS has been described as broadly pro-market,&lt;ref name=":25" /&gt; and its economic policies have been characterised as [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]].&lt;ref name=":43" /&gt; SDS advocates for lower taxes and speeding up privatisation efforts.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/03/anti-immigration-party-leads-exit-poll-in-slovenian-election|title=Slovenian nationalist party set for power after winning election|last=Agencies|date=2018-06-04|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Social policy ====
SDS introduced legislation allowing for same-sex civil unions while in government,&lt;ref name=":25" /&gt; but has opposed recognition of same-sex marriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-slovenia-rights/slovenia-rejects-same-sex-marriages-in-a-referendum-idUSKBN0U30BS20151220|title=Slovenia rejects same-sex marriages in a referendum|last=Novak|first=Marja|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-06-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/22/world/europe/slovenians-deliver-major-setback-to-same-sex-marriage-in-vote.html|title=Slovenians Deliver Major Setback to Same-Sex Marriage in Referendum|date=2015-12-21|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-06-05|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Education policy ====
SDS advocates for the introduction of educational programs that would foster patriotism "from kindergarten through high school".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.delo.si/novice/politika/tudi-sds-za-domoljubno-vzgojo-od-vrtca-do-srednje-sole.html|title=Tudi SDS za domoljubno vzgojo od vrtca do srednje šole|last=STA|first=Pi. K., Delo.si,|access-date=2018-06-07|language=sl-si}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party supports full public financing of private school compulsory programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://english.sta.si/2477065/sds-proposal-for-full-funding-of-private-schools-rejected|title=STA: SDS proposal for full funding of private schools rejected|website=english.sta.si|language=en|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== National security ====
In early 2016, SDS proposed the establishment of a national guard composed of some 25,000 "patriotic" volunteers. The guard would replace all current reserve formations of the Slovene armed forces, would be under direct command of the general staff, and would be mobilised during natural disasters or during "altered national security states" (like the European refugee crisis, which was ongoing at the time). Both sexes could enlist. MP Žan Mahnič stated the establishment of the formation was a priority of the party's electoral platform. The proposal was prompted by worsening global national security prospects, in part due to the migrant crisis, a SDS representative said.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rtvslo.si/slovenija/sds-bi-25-000-domoljubov-zdruzil-v-nacionalni-gardi/383775|title=SDS bi 25.000 domoljubov združil v nacionalni gardi|work=Prvi interaktivni multimedijski portal, MMC RTV Slovenija|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Government representatives argued that such a formation is unnecessary as the current reserve formations are sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rtvslo.si/slovenija/zl-nacionalno-gardo-vidi-kot-desnicarsko-paravojsko-nsi-idejo-podpira/383871|title=ZL nacionalno gardo vidi kot "desničarsko paravojsko", NSi idejo podpira|work=Prvi interaktivni multimedijski portal, MMC RTV Slovenija|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Judiciary and law enforcement ====
SDS advocates for trials to be open to the public (except in special circumstances).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sds.si/zate/program|title=Program ZATE - Za pravično sojenje {{!}} SDS|website=www.sds.si|language=sl|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Other policies ====
SDS has long advocated for a change in the Slovene parliamentary electoral system, namely the shift from the current [[proportional electoral system]] to two-round [[plurality voting]]. SDS argues this would result in more stable and effective governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sds.si/en/about-sds/programme|title=About SDS - Programme {{!}} SDS|website=www.sds.si|language=en|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dnevnik.si/1042573817|title=Za SDS  večinski volilni sistem rešitev vseh težav|work=Dnevnik|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SDS supports citizens' legal right to bear arms, and has come out in opposition to further restrictions. It strongly opposed new EU regulation of firearms which the European Commission moved to pass after the [[November 2015 Paris attacks|2015 Paris terrorist attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.domovina.je/sds-proti-predlogu-za-otezitev-dostopa-do-orozja/|title=SDS proti predlogu za otežitev dostopa do orožja {{!}} Domovina|last=Uredništvo|website=www.domovina.je|language=sl-SI|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sta.si/2215016/sds-zaradi-predloga-za-otezitev-dostopa-do-orozja-za-izredno-sejo-odbora-dz|title=STA: SDS zaradi predloga za otežitev dostopa do orožja za izredno sejo odbora DZ|website=www.sta.si|language=sl|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rtvslo.si/evropska-unija/evroposlanci-sprejeli-strozjo-zakonodajo-o-orozju/417322|title=Evroposlanci sprejeli strožjo zakonodajo o orožju|work=Prvi interaktivni multimedijski portal, MMC RTV Slovenija|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mladina.si/171786/ljudska-obramba/|title=Ljudska obramba {{!}} MLADINA.si|work=Mladina.si|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SDS argues the current text to the [[Anthem of the Slovene nation|Slovene national anthem]]—the 7th stanza of [[France Prešeren|France Prešeren's]] [[Zdravljica|A Toast]] ("Blessed be all nations/Which yearn to see the light of day/When where'er the Sun doth wander/The lands' strife shall be cast away/And when free every kinsman will be/Not fiends, only neighbours in foreigners we'll see!")—is "too internationalistic, and insufficiently patriotic", and advocates other stanzas from Prešeren's poem be added as text to the official anthem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rtvslo.si/slovenija/kot-himno-bomo-se-peli-7-kitico-presernove-zdravljice/259929|title=Kot himno bomo še peli 7. kitico Prešernove Zdravljice|work=Prvi interaktivni multimedijski portal, MMC RTV Slovenija|access-date=2018-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":40"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rtvslo.si/slovenija/retroaktivnost-v-predlogu-sds-a-o-nezastarljivosti-umora-neustavna/331314|title=Retroaktivnost v predlogu SDS-a o nezastarljivosti umora "neustavna"|work=Prvi interaktivni multimedijski portal, MMC RTV Slovenija|access-date=2018-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":41"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.delo.si/novice/politika/poslanci-nasprotujejo-spremembam-zakona-o-drzavnih-simbolih.html|title=SDS znova neuspešna s predlogom zakona o državnih simbolih|last=STA|first=Ni.

=== Foreign policy ===
The party is pro-European,&lt;ref name=":25" /&gt; but staunchly anti-immigration and strongly opposed to EU asylum quotas.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

=== Post-communist cabal conspiracy ===
Perhaps the most peculiar aspect of SDS ideology are the unique beliefs and rhetoric frequently employed by members of the party. The central tenet of the party's view regarding the country's political situation is that a sinister clique composed mostly of leftist former communist party officials has retained significant control over the economic, financial, political, social, judicial, and journalistic aspects of Slovenian public life. Some of the beliefs and language used are also shared by other right-wing populist political actors, or have entered into the mainstream political discourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://english.sta.si/2245524/slovenian-political-metaphors-and-metonymy-a-guide|title=STA: Slovenian political metaphors and metonymy - a guide|website=english.sta.si|language=en|access-date=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":39" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":43" /&gt;{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

SDS members and affiliates frequently employ particular phrases and concepts to represent their world-view, most notably:
* "Udbomafia" (from [[UDBA]], the Yugoslav secret police service) – a portmanteau neologism coined in the early 1990s to refer to an alleged cabal of former [[League of Communists of Slovenia|Slovenian Communist Party]] members, and UDBA informants and collaborators that supposedly still hold the reigns of economic and political control. The phrase is often used by SDS and affiliated publications.&lt;ref name=":33"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nova24tv.si/news/have-you-heard-of-kucans-clan-a-mafia-like-group-from-the-league-of-communists-whose-aim-was-to-economically-control-slovenia-after-its-independence-and-assure-the-survival-of-thei/|title=Have you heard of Kučan's clan – a mafia-like group from the League of Communists, whose aim was to economically control Slovenia after its independence and assure the survival of their children? {{!}} Nova24TV|date=2017-12-19|work=Nova24TV|access-date=2018-06-05|language=sl-SI}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.si/books?id=bNvbHCUs3tUC&amp;pg=PA213&amp;dq=udbomafia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiL-KOo47jbAhWLr6QKHaUAA2wQ6wEIOzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=udbomafia&amp;f=false|title=Politics, Power and the Struggle for Democracy in South-East Europe|last=Dawisha|first=Karen|last2=Parrott|first2=Bruce|date=1997-06-13|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521597333|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.si/books?id=l-T1dAxBkHUC&amp;pg=PA314&amp;dq=udbomafia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjCofy6h7nbAhUHr6QKHR8SBZ4Q6wEIMDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=udbomafia&amp;f=false|title=New Xenophobia in Europe|last=Baumgartl|first=Bernd|last2=Favell|first2=Adrian|date=1995-10-02|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=9041108653|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.si/books?id=QZr1vsDIvlUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA159&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Radical Right in Central and Eastern Europe Since 1989|last=Ramet|first=Sabrina P.|date=2010-11-01|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=0271043792|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mladina.si/?__rewriter=1&amp;id=147621&amp;|title=Nadaljnje delitve naroda na rdeče in črne {{!}} MLADINA.si|work=Mladina.si|access-date=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://english.sta.si/2186108/demokracija-smells-corruption-in-bad-bank-dismissals|title=STA: Demokracija "smells corruption" in bad bank dismissals|website=english.sta.si|language=en|access-date=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://english.sta.si/2428011/weekly-parties-might-have-been-bribed-in-iran-money-laundering|title=STA: Weekly: Parties might have been bribed in Iran money laundering|website=english.sta.si|language=en|access-date=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other radical beliefs ===
Some SDS members and functionaries have also been known to express other fringe beliefs. Slovene philosopher [[Slavoj Žižek]], writing about the beliefs associated with the party while commenting on the 2018 parliamentary election results, quotes Bernard Brščič, characterising him as one of the party's "main ideologists". Brščič, writing in the SDS party publication, Demokracija, stated that Hungarian billionaire philanthropist [[George Soros]] (who is of Jewish descent) is "one of the most depraved and dangerous people of our time" as he is facilitating the "invasion of the negroid and Semitic hordes and thereby for the twilight of the EU … as a typical talmudo-Zionist, he is a deadly enemy of the Western civilisation, nation state and white, European man." Continuing, Brščič writes that Soros is building a "rainbow coalition composed of social marginals like faggots, feminists, Muslims and work-hating cultural Marxists" to perform "a deconstruction of the nation-state, and transform EU into a multicultural dystopia of the United States of Europe."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/slovenia-elections-trump-roseanne-bar-brexit-italy-slavoj-zizek-janez-jansa-a8382751.html|title='To understand what just happened in Slovenia, you have to go back to Donald Trump and Roseanne Barr'|last=|first=|date=2018-06-04|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-06-04|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though they were never asked whether they support the party or informed they will be listed as supporters, SDS nevertheless listed them as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dnevnik.si/1042203675|title=Ocenjevali vlado in postali podporniki SDS|work=Dnevnik|access-date=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies and criticism ==
=== Ties to extremist groups ===
SDS has been criticised for alleged links to a neo-Nazi extremist group; [[Far-right politics in Slovenia#Blood &amp; Honour|the Slovene branch of Blood &amp; Honour]].&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2014/sep/15/press-freedom-slovenia|title=Slovenian journalist facing jail for revealing party's neo-Nazi links|last=Greenslade|first=Roy|date=2014-09-15|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journalist who uncovered the links (Anuška Delić) was charged with leaking confidential information.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; The state intelligence agency, [[Slovenian Intelligence and Security Agency|SOVA]], headed by an SDS appointee at the time of the indictment,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mladina.si/160578/neonacisti-na-varnem/|title=Neonacisti na varnem {{!}} MLADINA.si|work=Mladina.si|access-date=2018-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; inadvertently confirmed allegations made by Delić by stating that the information revealed in the reports was consistent with findings of an ongoing investigation into the activities of the violent extremist group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.delo.si/novice/politika/ugotovitve-do-katerih-je-prislo-delo-sova-potrjuje.html|title=Neonacisti pri nas: Sova potrjuje ugotovitve Dela|last=politika|first=Mario Belovič, Rok Kajzer, notranja|access-date=2018-06-02|language=sl-si}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.delo.si/novice/slovenija/zaradi-razkrivanja-neonacisticne-mreze-preganjajo-novinarko-dela.html|title=Zaradi razkrivanja neonacistične mreže preganjajo novinarko Dela|last=kronika|first=Klara Škrinjar, notranja politika, Iva Ropac,|access-date=2018-06-02|language=sl-si}}&lt;/ref&gt; SOVA argued that the information revealed in the reports could not have been obtained by any other means than by gaining access to information collected during the agency's covert investigations, and that the publication disrupted its efforts to monitor the group by alerting B &amp; H of the monitoring efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dnevnik.si/1042688464|title=Predobravnavni narok zoper Delićevo: predlagali zaslišanje Türka, Pahorja in Masleše|work=Dnevnik|access-date=2018-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://siol.net/novice/crna-kronika/nekdanja-direktorja-sove-razkrivanje-tajnih-podatkov-lahko-ogrozi-zivljenja-67863|title=Nekdanja direktorja Sove: Razkrivanje tajnih podatkov lahko ogrozi življenja|access-date=2018-06-02|language=sl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delić alleged the charges were "politically motivated".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rtvslo.si/crna-kronika/anuska-delic-ovadba-je-politicno-motivirana/355056|title=Anuška Delić: Ovadba je politično motivirana|work=Prvi interaktivni multimedijski portal, MMC RTV Slovenija|access-date=2018-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dnevnik.si/1042702263|title=Anuška Delić: ovadba je politično motivirana, tožilstvo bi moralo postopek ustaviti|work=Dnevnik|access-date=2018-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Blood &amp; Honour members were allegedly also members of SDS,&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dnevnik.si/1042492052|title=Nasprotujoče si informacije: So v SDS-ov podmladek včlanjeni tudi neonacisti?|work=Dnevnik|access-date=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.delo.si/ozadja/v-blizini-neonacistov-in-vrha-politike.html|title=V bližini neonacistov in vrha politike|last=Ozadja|first=Anuška Delić, Rok Kajzer,|access-date=2018-06-03|language=sl-si}}&lt;/ref&gt; and formally met with SDS MP Branko Grims.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto9"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.delo.si/novice/politika/ugotovitve-do-katerih-je-prislo-delo-sova-potrjuje.html|title=Neonacisti pri nas: Sova potrjuje ugotovitve Dela|last=politika|first=Mario Belovič, Rok Kajzer, notranja|access-date=2018-06-03|language=sl-si}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group (the members of which allegedly received training by members of the Slovenian armed forces on an army [[Proving ground|training area]], borrowed army weaponry (a rocket launcher), attempted to purchase handguns, and were in direct correspondence with [[Anders Behring Breivik|Anders Breivik]] by both mail and e-mail, with multiple B &amp; H members receiving his manifesto before Breivik's killing spree&lt;ref name="auto9"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mladina.si/160578/neonacisti-na-varnem/|title=Neonacisti na varnem {{!}} MLADINA.si|work=Mladina.si|access-date=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was allegedly intimately implicated in orchestrating the violent riots which took place amid the [[2012–13 Slovenian protests]].&lt;ref name="auto9"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto10"/&gt; The organised group of violent agitators that disrupted a major protest in Ljubljana was also suspected of having been trained, hired, and compensated, possibly by a political party, according to unofficial sources within the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mladina.si/118519/neonacisti-so-tu/|title=Neonacisti so tu {{!}} MLADINA.si|work=Mladina.si|access-date=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, SDS has also fostered close ties with [[Far-right politics in Slovenia#Generation Identity Slovenia|Generation Identity Slovenia]], the Slovenian chapter of the far-right [[Identitarian movement]] organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://siol.net/novice/slovenija/generacija-identitete-skrajno-gibanje-ki-je-z-volitvami-v-sloveniji-dobilo-nov-zagon-467050|title=Generacija identitete: skrajno gibanje, ki je z volitvami v Sloveniji dobilo nov zagon|access-date=2018-06-03|language=sl}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2018, the party's publishing company, New Horizons,&lt;ref name="Dnevnik"/&gt; anonymously published the Slovene Identitarians' alt-right book, ''Manifesto for the Homeland''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nova24tv.si/slovenija/jutri-izide-knjiga-za-katero-levicarji-grozijo-da-bi-jo-morali-prepovedali-prihaja-manifest-za-domovino/|title=[Video] Danes izide knjiga, za katero levičarji grozijo, da bi jo morali prepovedati; Prihaja Manifest za domovino! {{!}} Nova24TV|date=2018-08-28|work=Nova24TV|access-date=2018-09-05|language=sl-SI}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mladina.si/187087/manifest-za-slovenijo-alpe-pa-francoske/|title=Manifest za Slovenijo, Alpe pa francoske {{!}} MLADINA.si|work=Mladina.si|access-date=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was also promoted by SDS-affiliated media organisations and individuals, including SDS leader Janez Janša,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mladina.si/187087/manifest-za-slovenijo-alpe-pa-francoske/|title=Manifest za Slovenijo, Alpe pa francoske {{!}} MLADINA.si|work=Mladina.si|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mladina.si/187229/manifest-nove-desnice/|title=Manifest nove desnice  {{!}} MLADINA.si|work=Mladina.si|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vecer.com/nova-obzorja-na-trg-s-knjigo-skupine-ki-siri-sovrazni-govor-6553758|title=Nova obzorja na trg s knjigo skupine, ki širi sovražni govor|work=Časnik Večer d.o.o.|access-date=2018-09-09|language=sl-si}}&lt;/ref&gt; with SDS MP Žan Mahnič even going so far as to post on Twitter a photo of the book taken from his parliamentary seat, with the floor of the parliamentary chamber in the background.&lt;ref name="Mladina.si"/&gt;

=== Political self-dealing accusations ===
The party has been accused of political self-dealing and nepotism, appointing relatives, allies, and friends to government (and other) positions. Many close relatives of prominent SDS members have found employment in the Slovenian and European parliaments, high ranking public sector positions, and state-owned companies (some despite not meeting the official job requirements).&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mladina.si/182937/nepotisticna-hobotnica/|title=Nepotistična hobotnica  {{!}} MLADINA.si|work=Mladina.si|access-date=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mladina.si/120739/nepotizem/|title=Nepotizem {{!}} MLADINA.si|work=Mladina.si|access-date=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vecer.com/poleg-zana-janse-delata-za-tomcevo-tudi-petkov-sin-in-brat-jerajeve-6352314|title=Poleg Žana Janše delata za Tomčevo tudi Petkov sin in brat Jerajeve|work=Časnik Večer d.o.o.|access-date=2018-06-05|language=sl-si}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":36"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mladina.si/49135/prvo-leto-kadrovanja/|title=Prvo leto kadrovanja {{!}} MLADINA.si|work=Mladina.si|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SDS has been accused of political firings and replacements in, and selective financing of many institutions under the public sphere, and creating an environment where politisation of the public workplace was permissible and pervasive while in power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mladina.si/185777/kaj-pomeni-jansa-na-oblasti/|title=Kaj pomeni Janša na oblasti? {{!}} MLADINA.si|work=Mladina.si|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":36" /&gt;

=== Cult of personality ===
SDS leader Janez Janša has continuously served as party head since 1993 without a single other contender for the post.&lt;ref name="auto8"/&gt; Party members are extremely loyal to Janša,&lt;ref name=":25" /&gt; and it has often been noted that the party appears to resemble a cult,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://english.sta.si/2389847/delo-sees-sds-trapped-by-jansa-cult-and-past|title=STA: Delo sees SDS trapped by Janša cult and past|website=english.sta.si|language=en|access-date=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sloveniatimes.com/tough-driver-for-a-rocky-road|title=Tough Driver for a Rocky Road|website=www.sloveniatimes.com|language=sl|access-date=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; a view also shared by numerous past members of the party who claim any dissent within the party is strongly rebuked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://siol.net/novice/slovenija/poslanec-andrej-cus-zapusca-sds-417954|title=Andrej Čuš zapušča SDS in pravi: Nisem ne Janševa ne Kučanova lutka (video)|access-date=2018-06-05|language=sl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/plaz-se-je-usul-andrej-cus-izstopil-iz-sds-vera-ban-ima-prav.html|title=Vsak dan prvi - 24ur.com|website=www.24ur.com|language=sl|access-date=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.domovina.je/besede-s-katerimi-so-sds-zapuscali-njeni-ugledni-clani/|title=Besede, s katerimi SDS zapuščajo njeni ugledni člani {{!}} Domovina|last=Uredništvo|website=www.domovina.je|language=sl-SI|access-date=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://novice.svet24.si/clanek/novice/slovenija/57e3c715973f2/iz-sds-odhaja-tudi-znidar|title=Janšo spet zapuščajo poslanci|work=Svet24.si|access-date=2018-06-05|language=sl-SI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Campaign financing impropriety allegations ===
In the run-up to the 2018 Slovenian parliamentary election, SDS attempted to receive a loan of €450.000 from an individual residing in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://english.sta.si/2469274/report-sds-obtains-loan-from-individual-in-bosnia|title=STA: Report: SDS obtains loan from individual in Bosnia|website=english.sta.si|language=en|access-date=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; to fund its electoral campaign. The party came into contact with the individual via Nova obzorja publishing company (partially owned by SDS). SDS also put up its share in Nova obzorja as collateral.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/nenavadno-posojilo-stranke-sds-od-32-letnice-iz-bih-najeli-kar-450-000-evrov-kredita.html|title=Vsak dan prvi - 24ur.com|website=www.24ur.com|language=sl|access-date=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sum borrowed exceeded limits set by campaign finance laws, however, and SDS was obliged to return the borrowed funds. A police and financial court investigation was also triggered after the terms of the loan became public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://siol.net/novice/slovenija/sds-vrnil-sporno-posojilo-z-obrestmi-457338|title=SDS vrnila sporno posojilo z obrestmi #video|access-date=2018-06-03|language=sl}}&lt;/ref&gt; An investigation into the lender was also launched, based on suspicions of money laundering, tax avoidance, destruction and falsification of business documents, and overseeing dummy companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://siol.net/posel-danes/novice/pranje-denarja-kaj-je-razkrila-parlamentarna-komisija-vzivo-467626|title=Pranje denarja: več kazenskih ovadb gre na policijo #video|access-date=2018-06-03|language=sl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/dijana-dzudzic-naj-bi-z-razlicnih-racunov-dvignila-vec-kot-3-5-milijona-gotovine.html|title=Vsak dan prvi - 24ur.com|website=www.24ur.com|language=sl|access-date=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The individual was allegedly a part of a criminal organisation managing dummy companies that received funds of undisclosed origins (including the funds later loaned to SDS).&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.delo.si/novice/slovenija/sds-si-je-denar-menda-izposodila-pri-muli-51788.html|title=SDS si je denar menda izposodila pri muli|last=Potič|first=Zoran|access-date=2018-06-03|language=sl-si}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Less than a week before the 2018 parliamentary election took place, it was revealed that media/publishing companies closely affiliated and partially owned by SDS received some €800.000 from two Hungarian nationals (or, rather, their companies) - both with close ties to Hungarian president [[Viktor Orbán]] - months before the election, bringing the total amount SDS-affiliated media companies received from Hungarian entities to over €2.2M. The SDS-affiliated media companies that received the funds in turn purchased campaign adds for SDS. Nova obzorja publishing company also attempted to loan €60,000 to the party. The same Hungarian individuals also provided funds for political allies in Makedonia. It is furthermore also known that the loan SDS attempted to obtain from a Bosnian citizen some months earlier had a Hungarian connection.&lt;ref name=":35" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":34"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://english.sta.si/2519419/foreign-campaign-financing-forbidden-sds-denies-bypass|title=STA: Foreign campaign financing forbidden, SDS denies bypass|website=english.sta.si|language=en|access-date=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vecer.com/volitve-schatz-in-adamikova-vbrizgala-svez-denar-v-medijski-sistem-sds-6482056|title=Svež denar v medijskem sistemu SDS: Kdo je Agnes Adamik?|work=Časnik Večer d.o.o.|access-date=2018-06-03|language=sl-si}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mladina.si/185556/madzarski-dolznik/|title=Madžarski dolžnik {{!}} MLADINA.si|work=Mladina.si|access-date=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://english.sta.si/2520180/alleged-hungarian-financing-of-sds-draws-ire-from-alde|title=STA: Alleged Hungarian financing of SDS draws ire from ALDE|website=english.sta.si|language=en|access-date=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto7"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":31" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33459">'''Suffrage in Australia''' refers to the right to vote (usually referred to as '''franchise''') for people living in [[Commonwealth of Australia|Australia]], including all its six component states (before 1901 called colonies) and territories, as well as local councils. The colonies of Australia began to grant [[universal male suffrage]] during the 1850s and [[women's suffrage]] followed between the 1890s and 1900s. Today, the right to vote at federal, state and local levels of government is enjoyed by all [[citizens of Australia]] over the age of 18 years.

==History==
[[File:Parliament House Canberra Dusk Panorama.jpg|thumb|[[Parliament House, Canberra]].]]
Upon first white settlement in New South Wales in 1788, the appointed [[Governor of New South Wales|Governors]] had [[autocratic]] powers within the colony, but agitation for representative government began soon after the settlement.&lt;ref name="moadoph.gov.au"&gt;[http://moadoph.gov.au/our-democracy/democracy-timeline/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110327003948/http://moadoph.gov.au/our-democracy/democracy-timeline/ |date=March 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A legislative body, the [[New South Wales Legislative Council]], was created in 1825, which was an appointed body whose function was to advise the Governor. On 24 August 1824, 5 members were appointed to the Council, which increased to 7 members in 1825, and between 10 and 15 in 1829. Also in 1829, British sovereignty was extended to cover the whole of Australia, and everyone born in Australia, including Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders, became British subjects by birth.

The first parliamentary elections in Australia took place in 1843 for the New South Wales Legislative Council under the ''New South Wales Constitution Act 1842'' (UK).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://foundingdocs.gov.au/item-did-44.html |title=New South Wales Constitution Act 1842 (UK)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council had 36 members, of which 12 were appointed by the Governor and the remainder were elected. The right to vote was limited to men with a freehold valued at £200 or a householder paying rent of £20 per year, both very large sums at the time.

In the 1850s, limited self-government was granted to South Australia (1856), Victoria (1857), New South Wales (1858) and Tasmania (1896): all adult (21 years) male [[British subject]]s became entitled to vote. This included indigenous people but they were not encouraged to enroll. Queensland gained self-government in 1859 and Western Australia in 1890, but these colonies denied indigenous people the vote. An innovative [[secret ballot]] was introduced in Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

In 1856, under a new Constitution, the [[New South Wales Parliament]] became bicameral with a fully elected Legislative Assembly and a fully appointed Legislative Council with a Government taking over most of the legislative powers of the Governor. On 22 May 1856, the newly constituted New South Wales Parliament opened and sat for the first time. The right to vote for Legislative Assembly was extended to all adult males in 1858.&lt;ref name=NSW&gt;{{cite web |title=About us |publisher=NSW Parliament |url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/web/common.nsf/key/AboutUsHome |accessdate=17 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901, the six Australian colonies united to form the federal [[Commonwealth of Australia]]. The first election for the Commonwealth Parliament in 1901 was based on the electoral laws at that time of the six colonies, so that those who had the right to vote and to stand for Parliament at state level had the same rights for the [[Australian federal election, 1901|1901 Australian federal election]]. Only in South Australia (since 1895) and Western Australia (since 1899) did women have a vote. Tasmania retained a small property qualification for voting, but in the other states all male British subjects over 21 could vote. Only in South Australia (which included the Northern Territory) and Tasmania were [[indigenous Australians]] even theoretically entitled to vote. A few may have done so in South Australia. Western Australia and [[Queensland]] specifically barred indigenous people from voting.

In 1902, the Commonwealth Parliament passed the ''[[Commonwealth Franchise Act 1902]]'', which established a uniform franchise law for the federal Parliament. The Act declared that all British subjects over the age of 21 years who had been living in Australia for at least 6 months were entitled to a vote, whether male or female, and whether married or single. Besides granting Australian women the right to vote at a national level, it also allowed them to stand for election to federal Parliament.&lt;ref name="http"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Elections/Australian_Electoral_History/righttovote.htm |title=The Right to Vote in Australia - Australian Electoral Commission |publisher=Aec.gov.au |date=2011-01-28 |accessdate=2012-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that Australia was the second country, after [[New Zealand]], to grant [[women's suffrage]] at a national level, and the first country to allow women to stand for Parliament. However, the Act also disqualified [[Indigenous people]] from Australia, Asia, Africa and the [[Pacific Islands]], with the exception of [[Māori people|Māori]], from voting, even though they were British subjects and otherwise entitled to a vote. By this provision, [[India]]n people, for example, were disqualified to vote. The only exception was in relation to those who were entitled under [[Section 41 of the Australian Constitution]] to a vote. Section 41 states that any individual who has gained a right to vote at a state level, must also have the right to vote in federal elections. The then Solicitor-General, [[Robert Garran]], interpreted the provision to mean that Commonwealth voting rights were granted by section 41 only to people who were already State voters in 1902. The effect was not to enable those who subsequently acquired the right to vote at a State level, but who were expressly excluded from the franchise by the 1902 Act, such as Indigenous Australians, to also vote at the federal level. Also, those otherwise entitled voters who are subject to a crime which carries a penalty of over one year in prison are disqualified to vote. There was also no representation for any of the territories of Australia.

In the meantime, State franchise laws continued in force until each one chose to amend them.

In 1897, in [[South Australia]], [[Catherine Helen Spence]] was the first woman to stand as a political candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Elections/Australian_Electoral_History/milestone.htm |title=Electoral Milestones for Women - Australian Electoral Commission |publisher=Aec.gov.au |date=2011-01-28 |accessdate=2012-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The restrictions on voting by indigenous Australians were relaxed after [[World War II]], and removed by the  ''Commonwealth Electoral Act'' in 1962.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Voting/indigenous_vote/indigenous.htm |title=Electoral Milestone / Timetable for Indigenous Australians - Australian Electoral Commission |publisher=Aec.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2012-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Australian Senate|Senator]] [[Neville Bonner]] became the first [[Aboriginal Australian]] to sit in the [[Australian Parliament|federal Parliament]] in 1971. [[Julia Gillard]] became the first female [[Prime Minister of Australia]] in 2010.

==Male suffrage==
[[File:BoyleFinniss.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Boyle Travers Finniss]] became the first [[Premier of South Australia]] in 1856 - and the first leader of an Australian colonial parliament elected by [[universal male suffrage]].]]
Traditional [[Aboriginal Australian|Aboriginal]] society had been governed by councils of elders and a corporate decision making process, but the first European-style governments established after 1788 were [[autocratic]] and run by appointed [[Governors of New South Wales|governors]] - although English law was transplanted into the Australian colonies by virtue of the [[doctrine of reception]], thus notions of the rights and processes established by the ''[[Magna Carta]]'' and the [[Bill of Rights 1689]] were brought from Britain by the colonists. Agitation for representative government began soon after the settlement of the colonies.&lt;ref name="moadoph.gov.au"/&gt;

[[Adelaide City Council]] was established in 1840 and the [[City of Sydney]] in 1842. The right to stand for election was limited to men who possessed £1000 worth of property and wealthy landowners were permitted up to four votes each in elections.

In 1835, [[William Wentworth]] had established the [[Australian Patriotic Association]] which agitated for [[representative government]] for New South Wales and a broad franchise, a goal at least partially achieved in 1842.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/44064/Australian-Patriotic-Association-APA www.britannica.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite opposition from conservative free settlers in the colony, who sought representative government but [[emancipist]]s being disenfranchised, the colony's constitution of 1842 gave to emancipists the same political rights as free settlers, but which was subject to a property test. The right to vote was limited to men with a freehold valued at £200 or a householder paying rent of £20 per year, both very large sums at the time. Australia's first parliamentary elections were conducted for the [[New South Wales Legislative Council]] in 1843. Voter rights were extended in New South Wales in 1850 and elections for legislative councils were held in the colonies of Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aec.gov.au/Elections/Australian_Electoral_History/reform.htm |title=Australia’s major electoral developments Timeline: 1788 - 1899 - Australian Electoral Commission |publisher=Aec.gov.au |date=2011-01-28 |accessdate=2012-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid 19th century, there was a strong desire for representative and responsible government in the Australian colonies, fed by the democratic spirit of the [[Australian gold rushes|goldfields]] evident at the [[Eureka Rebellion]] and the ideas of the great reform movements sweeping [[History of Europe|Europe]], the [[History of the United States|United States]] and the [[History of the British Empire|British Empire]], such as [[Chartism]]. The end of convict transportation accelerated reform in the 1840s and 1850s. ''The Australian Colonies Government Act'' [1850] was a landmark development which granted representative constitutions to New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania and the colonies enthusiastically set about writing constitutions which produced democratically progressive parliaments - though the constitutions generally maintained the role of the colonial upper houses as representative of social and economic "interests" and all established [[Constitutional Monarchy|Constitutional Monarchies]] with the [[British monarch]] as the symbolic head of state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aec.gov.au/Elections/Australian_Electoral_History/righttovote.htm |title=The Right to Vote in Australia - Australian Electoral Commission |publisher=Aec.gov.au |date=2011-01-28 |accessdate=2012-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1855 [[South Australia]] granted the right to vote to all male British subjects (a term which extended to Indigenous males) 21 years or over. This right was extended to Victoria in 1857 and New South Wales the following year. The other colonies followed until, in 1896, Tasmania became the last colony to grant universal male suffrage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aec.gov.au/Elections/Australian_Electoral_History/reform.htm |title=Australia’s major electoral developments Timeline: 1788 - 1899 - Australian Electoral Commission |publisher=Aec.gov.au |date=2010-06-11 |accessdate=2011-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; though some colonies explicitly excluded Indigenous males from the vote.

==Female suffrage==
{{Main|Women's suffrage in Australia}}
[[File:Catherine Helen Spence.jpg|thumb|150px|[[South Australia]]n suffragette [[Catherine Helen Spence]] (1825-1910). South Australian women achieved the right to vote and stand for parliament in 1895.]]

The female descendants of the [[Mutiny on the Bounty|Bounty mutineers]] who lived on [[Pitcairn Islands]] could vote from 1838, and this right transferred with their resettlement to [[Norfolk Island]] (now an [[States and territories of Australia|Australian external territory]]) in 1856.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=EC |url=http://www.elections.org.nz/study/education-centre/history/votes-for-women.html |title=Votes for Women &amp;#124; Elections New Zealand |publisher=Elections.org.nz |date=2005-04-13 |accessdate=2012-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819080640/http://www.elections.org.nz/study/education-centre/history/votes-for-women.html |archivedate=2012-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Propertied women in the colony of South Australia were granted the vote in local elections (but not parliamentary elections) in 1861. 
[[Henrietta Dugdale]] formed the first Australian women's suffrage society in [[Melbourne]], Victoria in 1884. Women in the other colonies soon followed forming their own societies. The international Women's Christian Temperance Union set up Womanhood Suffrage departments in each colony. The suffrage groups collected monster suffrage petitions to submit to the colonial parliaments, with varying success. For Queensland's three petitions, one for women and a second for men were collected in 1894, and a third arranged by the WCTU in 1897. Women in South Australia and the Northern Territory became eligible to vote for the [[Parliament of South Australia]] in 1895 and in 1897, [[Catherine Helen Spence]] became the first female political candidate for political office, unsuccessfully standing for election as a delegate to Federal Convention on Australian Federation. [[Western Australia]] granted voting rights to women in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=8 |title=Documenting Democracy |publisher=Foundingdocs.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2012-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203020826/http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=8 |archivedate=2010-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first election for the Parliament of the newly formed [[Commonwealth of Australia]] in 1901 was based on the electoral provisions of the six pre-existing colonies, so that women who had the vote and the right to stand for Parliament at state level, namely South Australia and Western Australia, had the same voting rights for the [[Australian federal election, 1901|1901 Australian federal election]]. The ''[[Commonwealth Franchise Act 1902]]'' set uniform rules across Australia, and gave all women the right to vote and stand for election for federal Parliament. Four women stood at the [[Australian federal election, 1903|1903 federal election]],&lt;ref name="aec.gov.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Voting/indigenous_vote/indigenous.htm |title=AEC.gov.au |publisher=AEC.gov.au |date=25 Oct 2007 |accessdate=27 Jun 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; all of whom stood as independents and all of whom were unsuccessful. The Act did, however, specifically exclude 'natives' from Commonwealth franchise unless already enrolled in a state at the time. The other states followed suit granting women over 21 the vote soon after: New South Wales in 1902, Tasmania in 1903, Queensland in 1905 and Victoria in 1908, the last state to do so.

The year in which women obtained the right to vote in Australia are summarised as follows:

==Indigenous Australians==
{{Main|Voting rights of Indigenous Australians}}
[[Indigenous Australians]] began to be enfranchised within Parliamentary systems of the Australian colonies during the 1850s. However, the granting of voting rights was uneven and restricted altogether in some colonies (and later states). Vestigial legal discrimination against Indigenous voters was removed in the 1960s.

When the colonial constitutions of [[New South Wales]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], South Australia and [[Tasmania]] were framed in the 1850s, voting rights were granted to all male British subjects over the age of 21, which included Aboriginal men. A few may have done so in South Australia. Western Australia and [[Queensland]] specifically barred indigenous people from voting. However, few Aborigines were aware of their rights and hence very few participated in elections. The situation became murkier when the ''[[Commonwealth Franchise Act 1902|Commonwealth Franchise Act]]'' was passed in 1902. The Act gave women a vote in [[elections in Australia|federal elections]] but Aboriginal people and people from Asia, Africa or the [[Pacific Islands]] (except for [[Māori people|Māori]]) were excluded unless entitled under [[Section 41 of the Australian Constitution]]. Section 41 states that any individual who has gained a right to vote at a state level, must also have the right to vote in federal elections. The Solicitor-General, Sir [[Robert Garran]], interpreted it to mean that Commonwealth rights were granted only to people who were already State voters in 1902. What transpired was a situation where Aboriginals who had already enrolled to vote were able to continue to do so, whereas those who had not were denied the right. This interpretation was challenged in Victoria in 1924 by an Indian migrant, where the magistrate ruled that Section 2 meant that people who acquired State votes at any date were entitled to a Commonwealth vote. The Commonwealth government in 1925 changed the law to give natives of British India living in Australia the vote&lt;ref name=history/&gt; (there were only about 100 in Australia at the time), but continued to deny other non-white applicants.

Campaigns for indigenous civil rights in Australia gathered momentum from the 1930s. In 1938, with the participation of leading indigenous activists like [[Douglas Nicholls]], the ''[[Australian Aborigines' League]]'' organised a protest "Day of Mourning" to mark the 150th anniversary of the arrival of the [[First Fleet]] of British in Australia and launched its campaign for full civil rights for all Aborigines. In the 1940s, the conditions of life for Aborigines could be very poor. A permit system restricted movement and work opportunities for many Aboriginal people. In the 1950s, the government pursued a policy of "assimilation" which sought to achieve full civil rights for Aborigines but also wanted them to adopt the mode of life of other Australians (which very often was assumed to require suppression of cultural identity).&lt;ref&gt;''The First Australians: A Fair Deal for a Dark Race'' par SBS TV 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949, the right to vote in federal elections was extended to all Indigenous people who had served in the armed forces, or were enrolled to vote in state elections (Queensland, Western Australian, and the Northern Territory still excluded indigenous people from the vote). Remaining federal restrictions were abolished in 1962, though enrolment was voluntary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Voting/indigenous_vote/indigenous.htm |title=AEC.gov.au |publisher=AEC.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2011-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, reflecting the strong [[civil rights movement]]s in the [[United States]] and [[South Africa]], many changes in Aborigines’ rights and treatment followed, including removal of restrictions on voting rights. The [[Menzies Government]] ''Commonwealth Electoral Act'' of 1962 confirmed the Commonwealth vote for all Aborigines. [[Western Australia]] gave them State votes in the same year, and [[Queensland]] followed in 1965.

The [[Australian referendum, 1967 (Aboriginals)|1967 referendum]] was held and electors overwhelmingly approved the amendment of the Constitution to remove discriminatory references and giving the national parliament the power to legislate specifically for [[Indigenous Australians]]. Contrary to frequently repeated mythology, this referendum did not cover citizenship for Indigenous people, nor did it give them the vote: they already had both. However, transferring this power away from the [[Parliaments of the Australian states and territories|State parliaments]] did bring an end to the system of [[Indigenous Australian reserves]] which existed in each state, which allowed Indigenous people to move more freely, and exercise many of their citizenship rights for the first time. From the late 1960s a movement for [[Indigenous land rights]] also developed. In the mid 1960s, one of the earliest Aboriginal graduates from the [[University of Sydney]], [[Charles N. Perkins|Charles Perkins]], helped organise [[Freedom Ride (Australia)|freedom rides]] into parts of Australia to expose discrimination and inequality. In 1966, the [[Gurindji strike|Gurindji]] people of Wave Hill station (owned by the [[Vestey Group]]) commenced strike action led by [[Vincent Lingiari]] in a quest for equal pay and recognition of land rights.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Bolton (1990) p.193 and 195&lt;/ref&gt;

Indigenous Australians began to take up representation in Australian parliaments during the 1970s. In 1971 [[Neville Bonner]] of the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] was appointed by the Queensland Parliament to replace a retiring senator, becoming the first Aborigine in Federal Parliament. Bonner was returned as a Senator at the 1972 election and remained until 1983. [[Hyacinth Tungutalum]] of the [[Country Liberal Party]] in the [[Northern Territory]] and [[Eric Deeral]] of the [[National Party of Australia|National Party]] of Queensland, became the first Indigenous people elected to territory and state legislatures in 1974. In 1976, Sir [[Douglas Nicholls]] was appointed [[Governor of South Australia]], becoming the first Aborigine to hold vice-regal office in Australia. [[Aden Ridgeway]] of the [[Australian Democrats]] served as a senator during the 1990s, but no indigenous person was elected to the House of Representatives, until West Australian [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] [[Ken Wyatt]], in August 2010.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

==Territory representation==
Until 1911, the [[Northern Territory]] was a part of [[South Australia]]. From 1863 to 1911, Territorians had the same voting rights for representatives in both Houses of the [[South Australian Parliament]] as people living in South Australia. The status of South Australian voters, which enfranchised both women and [[Indigenous Australian]]s there to a vote, also qualified them to vote in elections for both Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament at the first federal elections in 1901. In 1911, however, the Northern Territory was transferred to the Commonwealth government, which also had the effect of depriving Territorians of all political representation. At the time of the Commonwealth takeover the Territory's population was only 3031.&lt;ref name=Act1922&gt;Documenting a Democracy: [http://foundingdocs.gov.au/item-sdid-63.html Northern Territory Representation Act 1922 (Cth)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The lack of representation became a significant factor in the trades union agitation that led to the recall of the first Commonwealth-appointed Administrator, Dr John Anderson Gilruth, in 1918 and the forced exit of his three leading officials eight months later. The Territory's population had increased to only 3572 by 1921.&lt;ref name=Act1922 /&gt;

The Commonwealth Constitution did not allow for Federal electorates to cross state borders, and national governments shied away from a hypothetical impasse where a few hundred Territory voters might some day hold the balance of power in an evenly divided Commonwealth Parliament.&lt;ref name=Act1922 /&gt; In 1922, the ''Northern Territory Representation Act 1922'' was passed by the Australian Parliament to give the Territory one Member in the House of Representatives, but did not allow the Member to vote. Before 1936, the Member for Northern Territory could speak in the House and take part in committee work, but could not vote, and did not count for the purpose of forming government. Between 1936 and 1959 the Member was only able to veto motions to disallow laws made for the Territory, and between 1959 and 1968, the Member could only vote on matters relating to the Territory alone. In 1968, the Member for Northern Territory acquired full voting rights.

After the [[Australian federal election, 1974|1974 federal election]], the [[Whitlam Government|Whitlam Labor Government]] legislation to give the [[Australian Capital Territory]] and the Northern Territory representation in the [[Australian Senate]], with two senators being elected from each, was passed by the subsequent [[Joint Sitting, Australian parliament, 1974|Joint Sitting of parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/sota1973408/s4.html SENATE (REPRESENTATION OF TERRITORIES) ACT 1973 No. 39, 1974 - SECT 4]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Voting age==
Initially, voting in colonial elections was based on a property requirement. The Australian Constitution ensured that the right to vote for the Senate was granted to the same people as could vote for the House of Representatives. Some state upper houses were either appointed or kept a restricted franchise well into the last half of the 20th century. The South Australian Legislative Council was elected on a property-based franchise until 1973. The New South Wales Legislative Council was appointed until 1978. Since the 1970s, all the houses of Australian parliaments have been elected on a full adult franchise basis.&lt;ref name=Chapter3/&gt;

The property requirement was replaced for the lower houses of colonial Parliaments with a voting age of 21 years for men only, as follows: South Australia (1856), Victoria (1857), New South Wales (1858), Queensland (1872),  Western Australia (1893), Tasmania (1896).&lt;ref name=history&gt;[http://australianpolitics.com/voting/features/history-of-the-voting-franchise History Of The Voting Franchise In Australia]&lt;/ref&gt; Women of 21 years acquired the vote subsequently (see above). State voting age laws applied at the first federal election, and was legislated for federal elections in 1902, applying equally to men and women 21 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;Sec.3 of the ''[[Commonwealth Franchise Act 1902]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The exception was military service. In World War I, members of the armed services had the vote in some states, and in World War II, the Commonwealth and some states did the same.&lt;ref name=Chapter3&gt;[http://legalanswers.sl.nsw.gov.au/hot-topics-84-voting-and-elections/who-can-vote Chapter 3: Who can vote]&lt;/ref&gt;

The voting age for all federal elections was lowered from 21 to 18 in 1973.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; The states had lowered the voting age to 18 by 1973, the first being Western Australian in 1970.&lt;ref name=Chapter3/&gt;

==Disenfranchisement of prisoners==
At [[Federation of Australia|Federation]], the ''[[Commonwealth Franchise Act 1902]]'' [[disenfranchisement|disenfranchised]] those "attainted of treason, or who had been convicted and is under sentence or subject to be sentenced for any offence … punishable by imprisonment for one year or longer."&lt;ref name=Hill&gt;{{citation|title=Prisoner voting rights|first=Lisa|last=Hill|publisher=Australian Review of Public Affairs|url=http://www.australianreview.net/digest/2009/11/hill.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130318061231/http://www.australianreview.net/digest/2009/11/hill.html|archivedate=18 March 2013|deadurl=no|date=November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, this disenfranchisement was relaxed and prisoners serving a sentence for a crime punishable under the law for less than 5 years were allowed to vote.&lt;ref name=Davidson&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/Publications_Archive/CIB/cib0304/04cib12|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301121320/http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/Publications_Archive/CIB/cib0304/04cib12|archivedate=1 March 2014|title=Inside outcasts: prisoners and the right to vote in Australia|deadurl=no|first=Jerome|last=Davidson|date=24 May 2004|publisher=Parliament of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further softening occurred in 1995 when the disenfranchisement was limited to those actually serving a sentence of 5 years or longer,&lt;ref name=Hill/&gt;&lt;ref name=Davidson/&gt; although earlier that year the [[Keating Government]] had been planning legislation to extend voting rights to all prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|first=Paul|last=Keating|title=For Media: Prisoner voting|date=10 July 1995|url=http://pmtranscripts.dpmc.gov.au/browse.php?did=9664|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140824135405/http://pmtranscripts.dpmc.gov.au/browse.php?did=9664|archivedate=24 August 2014|author-link=Paul Keating}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disenfranchisement does not continue after release from jail/prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Prisoners|url = http://www.aec.gov.au/Enrolling_to_vote/special_category/Prisoners.htm|website = Australian Electoral Commission|accessdate = 2015-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Howard Government]] legislated in 2006 to ban all prisoners from voting; but in 2007, the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] in ''[[Roach v Electoral Commissioner]]'' found that the [[Constitution of Australia|Constitution]] enshrined a limited right to vote,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/court-gives-vote-back-to-some-inmates/2007/08/30/1188067277253.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080824053414/http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/court-gives-vote-back-to-some-inmates/2007/08/30/1188067277253.html|archivedate=24 August 2008|title=Court gives vote back to some inmates|date=31 August 2007|first=Jonathan|last=Pearlman|publisher=Fairfax Media|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; which meant that citizens serving relatively short prison sentences (generally less than 3 years) cannot be barred from voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.humanrights.gov.au/publications/right-vote-not-enjoyed-equally-all-australians#fnB9a |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814083152/https://www.humanrights.gov.au/publications/right-vote-not-enjoyed-equally-all-australians |archivedate=14 August 2014 |title=The right to vote is not enjoyed equally by all Australians: 4.

Each state has its own prisoner disenfranchisement thresholds. For example, prisoners in New South Wales serving a sentence of longer than one year are not entitled to vote in State elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Cite Legislation AU |NSW|act|peea1912|Parliamentary Electorates and Elections Act 1912|25(b)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Victoria, persons are struck off the roll if serving a prison sentence of 5 years or more.&lt;ref&gt;VEC, [https://www.vec.vic.gov.au/Enrolment/TheElectoralRoll.html The electoral roll]&lt;/ref&gt; There is no prisoner disenfranchisement in the Australian Capital Territory or South Australia.&lt;ref name=Chapter3/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8971">'''USA-USSR Dual Track Meet Series''' was an [[track and field|athletics]] meeting between [[United States]] and [[Soviet Union]]. It was held 19 times during the [[Cold War]] era from 1958 to 1985. The meeting was arranged alternatively in both countries, exception being the last event in 1985 which was held in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]. Seven indoor meetings were also competed in the 1970s. Although the meetings were foremost athletic competitions, they served as propaganda and foreign diplomacy tools as well.&lt;ref&gt;Turrini, p. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

The most classic meeting is considered the 1962 competition in [[Stanford, California]], with an attendance of more than 150,000 on a two-day event, the largest ever on a non-Olympic track and field competition. Even the Soviet workouts attracted crowds of 5,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/2012/07/19/track-and-fields-greatest-dual-meet-is-turning-50 |title= Track and field's greatest dual meet is turning 50 |publisher= Palo Alto Online |date= 19 July 2012 | language = |accessdate= 1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Stanford meeting was held just two months before the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] but the American and Soviet athletes competed in harmony and mutual friendship. Two world records were set in Stanford, [[Valeriy Brumel]] on [[Men's high jump world record progression|high jump]] and [[Hal Connolly]] on [[Men's hammer throw world record progression|hammer throw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://bleacherreport.com/articles/342578-usa-vs-ussr-1962-the-greatest-track-meet-of-all-time |title= USA vs. USSR, 1962: The Greatest Track Meet of All Time |publisher= Bleacher's Report |date= 9 February 2010 | language = |accessdate= 1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''United People's Democratic Solidarity''' was formed in March 1999 with the merger of two terrorist outfits in [[Assam]]'s [[Karbi Anglong district]], the Karbi National Volunteers (KNV) and Karbi People’s Front (KPF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/states/assam/terrorist_outfits/upds.htm|title=United People's Democratic Solidarity (UPDS) - Terrorist Group of Assam|publisher=Satp.org|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The outfit signed a cease-fire agreement for one year with the Union Government on May 23, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://karbinetwork.wordpress.com/upds/|title=UPDS|work=Karbi Information Network|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this led to a split in the UPDS with one faction deciding to continue with its subversive activities while the other commenced negotiations with the Government. Currently, there are two factions: pro-talks and anti-talks. On May 16, 2004, the UPDS (Anti-Talks) rechristened itself as the [[Karbi Longri N.C. Hills Liberation Front|Karbi Longri North Cachar Hills Liberation Front (KLNLF)]] and its armed wing as the Karbi Longri North Cachar Hills Resistance Force (KNPR).

==Leadership==
Kiri Rongphar was the founder ‘chairman’ of the outfit. He was arrested on October 22, 1999. On August 22, 2002, UPDS 'commander-in-chief' Long Kumar Kiling died of injuries sustained during a feline attack in the forests of Karbi Anglong district. Although this has not been proved.

At present, the outfit is headed by its Chairman Longder Singner alias H E Kathar and General Secretary Haren Sing Bey. T Nongloda is the outfit's Publicity Secretary and Lindok Ronghang its Finance Secretary.

The total cadre strength of the UPDS is estimated to be a little more than 150, of which at least 50 are believed to be armed with sophisticated weapons.

==Areas of operation==
The outfit's main area of operations is in the [[Karbi Anglong district]], with a relatively minor presence in [[Dima Hasao district]].

==Linkages==
The outfit is known to have grown with the active assistance of the [[National Socialist Council of Nagaland]]-Isak-Muivah (NSCN-IM), which provided it with arms and ammunition. It is reported to have procured arms and ammunition from [[Bhutan]] and [[Bangladesh]].

The UPDS also shares a ‘working relationship’ with the [[National Democratic Front of Bodoland|National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB)]] and the [[United Liberation Front of Assam|United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA)]].

==Funds==
Abductions for ransom and extortion are the main sources of income for the UPDS. The outfit generates a considerable amount of revenue by targeting the ginger producing [[Kuki people|Kukis]] in the Singhason Hills area. The non-Karbi traders are also targeted for extortion. In some cases, even [[Karbi people|Karbi]]'s have been the targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idsa.in/taxonomy/term/537|title=United Peoples Democratic Solidarity (UPDS) {{!}} Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|accessdate=August 14, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928172142/http://www.idsa.in/taxonomy/term/537|archivedate=September 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Peace talks==
The outfit held six rounds of peace talks with the State and Union Government representatives between 2002 and 2006. Tha last round of talks was held on July 26, 2006. Subsequently, the outfit pulled out of the talks process complaining of lack of progress on its core demands. The outfit's cadres are lodged in one Government guarded designated camp at [[Diphu]] with 60 cadres, two main camps and several sub-camps.

On August, 2011,  The Government of India released a statement wherein it planned to sign peace pacts with UPDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assamtribune.com/scripts/detailsnew.asp?id=aug1311/at09|title=Peace pacts with UPDS, DHD(J) soon|publisher=Assamtribune.com|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of November 25, 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://telegraphindia.com/1111128/jsp/frontpage/story_14807297.jsp|title=Confusion clouds UPDS accord  Parties differ over council|publisher=Telgraphindia.com|access-date=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1110108/jsp/northeast/story_13385507.jsp|title=The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) - Northeast - UPDS rules out poll politics|publisher=Telegraphindia.com|access-date=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Outfit has signed a tripartite peace accord &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/states/assam/documents/papers/UPDS_accord.htm|title=UPDS accord|publisher=Satp.org|access-date=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the Government Of India for reorganizing the existing autonomous district (Karbi Anglong) under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution into four administrative districts for better administrative and developmental administration.

As part of the restructuring and empowerment process, the existing autonomous council will be renamed the [[Autonomous administrative divisions of India#Karbi Anglong Autonomous Council|Karbi Anglong Autonomous Territorial Council]].

The proposed [[Autonomous administrative divisions of India#Karbi Anglong Autonomous Council|Karbi Anglong Autonomous Territorial Council]] will have 50 members to give greater representation to people living in remote and isolated clusters of villages.

Of these, 44 will be elected members and six will be nominated by the governor of [[Assam]].

According to the MoS, the increase in seats will be applicable from subsequent elections, due in the year 2016-17 or mid-term poll, if any, whichever is earlier.

Altogether 39 subjects will be transferred to the proposed [[Autonomous administrative divisions of India#Karbi Anglong Autonomous Council|Karbi Anglong Autonomous Territorial Council]] and its chief and deputy chief will have status equivalent to that of the cabinet minister and the other executive council members equivalent to the minister of state.

'''Vithal Mahadeo Tarkunde''' (3 July 1909 in [[Saswad]] – 22 March 2004 in [[Delhi]]), was a prominent Indian lawyer, civil rights activist, and humanist leader and has been referred to as the "Father of the Civil Liberties movement" in India and a former judge of the Bombay High Court&lt;ref name="Outlook"&gt;[http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?223371 Outlook MAR 24, 2004 TRIBUTE – Father Of Civil Liberties In India]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;PUCL Bulletin Special Issue Justice Tarkunde: Vol. XXVII, No. 3 {{ISSN|0970-8693}} MARCH 2007 ("''This is a special number of the PUCL Bulletin dedicated to the memory of V M Tarkunde, the doyen of the Civil Liberties Movement in India''")&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court of India also praised him as "undoubtedly the most distinguished judge of the post-[[M. C. Chagla|Chagla]] 1957 period" in the [[Bombay High Court]].&lt;ref name="court"&gt;Full Court Reference in memory of Late Shri V M Tarkunde,Senior Advocate, on Wednesday, 7 April 2004 in the Supreme Court of India Address by Soli J Sorabjee Attorney General for India&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==

Vithal Mahadeo Tarkunde was born in [[Saswad]], [[Pune District]], Maharashtra on 3 July 1909. He was the 2nd of the five children of Mahadeo Rajaram Tarkunde, a popular lawyer and social reformer at [[Saswad]],then headquarters of [[Purandar taluka]] adjoining Pune. His father, a [[Brahmin]] by caste, had fought against the practice of [[untouchability]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;A Restless Crusader for Human Rights – M A Rane, PUCL Bulletin Special Issue Justice Tarkunde: Vol. XXVII, No. 3 {{ISSN|0970-8693}} MARCH 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920 he migrated from Saswad to Pune and joined the New English School, Pune. In the Matriculation examination of 1925 held by the [[Bombay University]], he stood first in the erstwhile [[Bombay Presidency]]. He also secured the prestigious Jagannath Shankersheth Scholarship for Sanskrit. He then joined the [[Fergusson College]] for BA which he completed in 1929, subsequently moving to London, where he attended the Lincoln's Inn and qualified as a [[Barrister-at-Law]] in 1931. He also attended lectures in economics, political science and social anthropology at the [[London School of Economics]](LSE) as an external student. He returned to India the next year in December and commenced his legal practice in Pune.&lt;ref name="court"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Author Overview – Voice of A Great Sentinel: Selected Writings of V.M. Tarkunde – 1 January 2004 , 1st ed. – Renaissance Publishers Pvt. Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="inmemoriam"&gt;[http://www.pucl.org/Topics/PUCL/2004/tarkunde-condolence4.htm  In Memoriam, Justice V.M. Tarkunde (1909–2004)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal career==

Tarkunde started practice at Pune soon after he returned to India in 1933. He continued there till 1942 when he gave up his practice to become a full-time member of the [[Radical Democratic Party (India)|Radical Democratic Party]]. He resumed his legal practice in the [[Bombay High Court]] in 1948 after [[Independence of India|Independence]] and was elevated to the bench as a Judge of the [[Bombay High Court]] in September 1957. He stepped down voluntarily as Judge of the Bombay High Court in 1969 and set up practice in the [[Supreme Court of India]] where he continued till his resignation in 1977 at the age of 68. He was chiefly concerned with [[Public Interest Litigation]]s and constitutional cases, most of which he conducted with little or no fees.&lt;ref name="inmemoriam"/&gt;

==Activism==
In 1933, he joined the [[Congress Socialist Party]](CSP) and the [[Indian National Congress]] but later left the CSP disillusioned with their vote against [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] in the January 1939 Tripuri session of Congress. He then joined the League of Radical Congressmen led by his mentor [[M. N. Roy]] in April 1939.&lt;ref&gt;"Why I left the Congress", Through Humanist Eyes Vithal Mahadev Tarkunde.1st ed. New Delhi, Ajanta Publications,1997&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, Roy and Tarkunde, along with several others, left the Congress after dissenting on the question of participation in the [[Second World War]]. Roy advocated participation in the war against the [[Axis powers]], while simultaneously striving for Indian independence, and founded the [[Radical Democratic Party (India)|Radical Democratic Party]] to further this cause.In 1942, Tarkunde gave up his legal practice to become a full-time member of the [[Radical Democratic Party (India)|Radical Democratic Party]] and was elected General Secretary of the RDP in 1944, thereby migrating to Delhi. By 1946 Roy formulated the philosophy of New Humanism. By 1948 he and Roy decided that political parties were an inadequate instrument for promoting freedom of the people and so dissolved the RDP in December 1948. He returned to legal practice the same year.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

==Radical Humanism==

In 1969, Tarkunde founded the Indian Radical Humanist Association as an organisation for radical humanists. He also began editing the ''Radical Humanist'' (founded in 1937 by Roy as ''Independent India'') in April 1970, supporting it initially with his own income. In 1973 he was one of the signers of the [[Humanist Manifesto II|Humanist Manifesto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_II | title=Humanist Manifesto II | publisher=American Humanist Association | accessdate=24 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emergency==

During the [[Indian Emergency|emergency]], he worked closely with [[Jayaprakash Narayan]], providing leadership to the NGOs Citizens for Democracy and [[People's Union for Civil Liberties]], of which he was the founding president. He also worked on the [[Citizen's Justice Committee]] and played a principal part in resisting and investigating the excesses of the period, including the [[1984 Anti-Sikh riots]],&lt;ref&gt;Judge V.M. Tarkunde, et al., Oppression in Punjab: Report to the Nation, New Delhi: Citizens for Democracy, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; and human rights violations in the Punjab, Kashmir, and the North-East.&lt;ref name="Outlook"/&gt; His refusal to consider kashmiri pandits who had fled valley in 1990 as human right victims caused much controversy and led to his dubbing as " Terrorists' defender in chief" as he regularly attacked Indian army for fake encounters and extra judicial killings.In 1995, he departed from his earlier stand of considering firing by police as human rights violation and defended UP government in Muzaffarnagar police firing and rape on Uttarakhand state demand activists on 2 October 1994 in Supreme Court.His volte face was noted by honourable bench with humour and he won the case with court ruling that there was not adequate evidence of wilful human rights violation by State government.But it led to his breaking ranks with radical humanists.

Tarkunde was a board member for the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]]([[IHEU]]), the world union of Humanist organisations for over 40 years.&lt;ref name="iheu"&gt;[http://www.iheu.org/glossary/term/372?Array IHEU Glossary VM Tarkunde]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honours==

At the 1978 London Congress of the [[IHEU]], VM Tarkunde received the International Humanist Award 1978.&lt;ref name="iheu"/&gt; The Government of India awarded him the civilian honour of the [[Padma Bhushan]] in 1998.&lt;ref name="Padma Awards"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/LST-PDAWD-2013.pdf | title=Padma Awards | publisher=Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India | date=2015 | accessdate=July 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3906">The '''You Deserve To Know''' campaign, launched by [[The Agenda Project]], featured a video on [[YouTube]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExrzbGUrJYs/ |title=You Deserve To Know |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-02-06 |accessdate=2016-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; criticizing President [[Barack Obama]] for speaking with the [[United States Chamber of Commerce]] without acknowledging its status as the largest lobbyist in the United States and confronting it about its vehement opposition to vital economic reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.politico.com/politico44/perm/0211/that_other_chamber_38260adc-a694-477b-9595-8ca2c721a763.html |title=Group reminds Obama of SOTU vow &amp;#124; POLITICO 44 |website=Politico.com |date= |accessdate=2016-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Agenda Project founder [[Erica Payne]] explained the campaign by stating, "The Chamber claims to speak for American business, but half of the Chamber's budget is paid for by 45 big corporations. The President is well aware that the Chamber is in actuality just a high priced lobbyist for a small number of corporations. I hardly think the President will restore our faith in government by fawning over the banks at the center of the financial crisis, oil companies like BP who destroyed the Gulf, and insurance companies who secretly funneled $10 million through the Chamber to fight insurance reform." &lt;ref&gt; Hall, Mimi [http://content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2011/02/obama-takes-heat-for-chamber-speech---before-he-delivers-it/1 "Obama Takes Heat for Chamber Speech - Before he Delivers It], "The Oval", February 7, 2011, accessed June 20, 2011. &lt;/ref&gt; 

The title of the video is a reference to the President's [[State of the Union]] address, during which he stated "You deserve to know when your elected officials are meeting with lobbyists." &lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/State_of_the_Union/state-of-the-union-2011-full-transcript/story?id=12759395/ "State Of The Union 2011 Transcript"], "ABC News", January 25, 2011, accessed June 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
