'''Adductomics''' is the study of [[DNA adducts]] in the context of an entire [[genome]].  DNA adducts are [[Chemical compound|compounds]] that bind to [[DNA]], causing damage and [[mutations]].  These mutations can result in [[cancer]] and [[birth defects]] in [[multicellular organisms]].  The science of adductomics seeks to identify all DNA adducts and the target sequence of each adduct.

The term "adductome" first appeared in a journal article in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;MATSUDA TOMONARI, ROBERT A. KANALY, HANAOKA TOMOYUKI, SUGIMURA HARUHIKO, TODA HIROKAZU, MATSUI SABURO.  2005.  "DNA adductome strategy for detection of multiple DNA adducts." Nippon Kankyo Hen'igen Gakkai Taikai Puroguramu, Yoshishu.  34:77&lt;/ref&gt;  Although originally the term related to adducts of DNA, the adductomic approach has now been adopted by [[protein]] chemists in their attempts to identify [[protein adducts]].

'''Ayyub''' is an [[impact crater]] in the northern hemisphere of [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]].  Ayyub was first observed in ''[[Cassini-Huygens Mission|Cassini]]'' images during that mission's February 2005 flyby of Enceladus.  It is located at 38.4° North [[Latitude]], 295.7° West [[Longitude]] and is 18 kilometers across.&lt;ref name=gpn /&gt;  The topography of the impact crater appears very subdued, suggesting that the crater has undergone significant viscous relaxation since its formation.  Tectonics has also affected this crater, by influencing the final, polygonal shape of the crater as well disrupting the southeastern and northwestern margins of the crater following its formation.

[[Ayyub (Arabian Nights)|Ayyub]] is named after a Damascus merchant, father of Ghanim and Fitnah, in the "[[Tale of Ghanim Bin Ayyub, the Distraught, the Thrall O’ Love]]" in ''[[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights]]''. Craters named [[Ghanim (crater)|Ghanim]] and [[Fitnah (crater)|Fitnah]] are found near Ayyub.

Its first phase (Design) ran from September 2005 to around October 2006, and was intended to generate new ideas for biological architectures that could be used to create embodied computational architectures of human intelligence.  
   
The second phase (Implementation) of BICA was set to begin in the spring of 2007, and would have involved the actual construction of new intelligent agents that live and behave in a [[virtual environment]].  However, this phase was canceled by DARPA, reportedly because it was seen as being too ambitious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://robots.net/article/2172.html|title=robots.net - DARPA Ends Brain Reverse Engineering Project|website=robots.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Now BICA is a [[transdisciplinary]] study that aims to design, characterise and implement human-level cognitive architectures. There is also BICA Society, a nonprofit organization formed to promote and facilitate this study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13521">The '''biophilia hypothesis''' also called BET suggests that humans possess an innate tendency to seek connections with [[nature]] and other forms of life.&lt;ref&gt;"biophilia hypothesis." Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite.  Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; [[E. O. Wilson|Edward O. Wilson]]  introduced and popularized the hypothesis in his book, ''Biophilia'' (1984).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Edward O.|title=Biophilia|year=1984|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|location=[[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]]|isbn=0-674-07442-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He defines biophilia as "the urge to affiliate with other forms of life".&lt;ref&gt;Kellert &amp; Wilson 1995, p. 416.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Love of living systems ==
The term "biophilia" means "love of life or living systems." It was first used by [[Erich Fromm]] to describe a [[Erich Fromm|psychological orientation]] of being attracted to all that is alive and vital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fromm|first=Erich|title=The Heart of Man|year=1964|publisher=[[Harper &amp; Row]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson uses the term in the same sense when he suggests that biophilia describes "the connections that human beings subconsciously seek with the rest of life." He proposed the possibility that the deep affiliations humans have with other life forms and nature as a whole are rooted in our biology. Unlike [[phobia]]s, which are the aversions and fears that people have of things in their environment, [[philia]]s are the attractions and positive feelings that people have toward organisms, species, habitats, processes and objects in their natural surroundings. 
Although named by Fromm, the concept of biophilia has been proposed and defined many times over. Aristotle was one of many to put forward a concept that could be summarized as "love of life". Diving into the term ''philia'', or friendship, Aristotle evokes the idea of reciprocity and how friendships are beneficial to both parties in more than just one way, but especially in the way of happiness.&lt;ref&gt;SANTAS, ARISTOTELIS. "Aristotelian Ethics And Biophilia." Ethics &amp; The Environment 19.1 (2014): 95-121. GreenFILE. Web. 24 Feb. 2015 http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=2ed69cd6-0f3e-47aa-b03a-a284b3619652%40sessionmgr113&amp;vid=4&amp;hid=116&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''Children and Nature: Psychological, Sociocultural, and Evolutionary Investigations'' edited by Peter Kahn and Stephen Kellert,&lt;ref name="childrennature"&gt;{{cite book|title=Children and nature: psychological, sociocultural, and evolutionary investigations|first=Peter |last=Kahn|first2=Stephen |last2=Kellert|year=2002 |publisher=[[MIT Press]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RCjdKjI_qIcC&amp;pg=PA153|isbn=0-262-11267-1 |page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; the importance of animals, especially those with which a child can develop a nurturing relationship, is emphasized particularly for early and middle childhood. Chapter 7 of the same book reports on the help that animals can provide to children with autistic-spectrum disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=Animals in Therapeutic Education: Guides into the Liminal State|first=Aaron|last=Katcher|title=Children and Nature: Psychological, Sociocultural, and Evolutionary Investigations|year=2002|editor1-last=Kahn|editor1-first=Peter H.|editor2-last=Kellert|editor2-first=Stephen R|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RCjdKjI_qIcC&amp;pg=PA179|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0-262-11267-1|accessdate=January 30, 2013|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Product of biological evolution ==
Human preferences toward things in [[nature]], while refined through experience and culture, are hypothetically the product of biological evolution. For example, adult mammals (especially humans) are generally attracted to baby mammal faces and find them [[Cuteness|appealing]] across species. The large eyes and small features of any young mammal face are far more appealing than those of the mature adults.

Similarly, the hypothesis helps explain why ordinary people care for and sometimes risk their lives to save domestic and wild animals, and keep plants and flowers in and around their homes. In other words, our natural love for life helps sustain life.

Very often, flowers also indicate potential for food later. Most fruits start their development as flowers. For our ancestors, it was crucial to spot, detect and remember the plants that would later provide nutrition.

==Biophilia and conservation==
Because of our technological advancements and more time spent inside buildings and cars, it is argued that the lack of biophilic activities and time spent in nature may be strengthening the disconnect of humans from nature. Although, it also has shown strong urges among people to reconnect with nature. 
The concern for a lack of connection with the rest of nature outside of us, is that a stronger disregard for other plants, animals and less appealing wild areas could lead to further ecosystem degradation and species loss. Therefore, reestablishing a connection with nature has become more important in the field of conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rogers|first1=Kara|title=Biophilia Hypothesis|url=http://www.britannica.com/science/biophilia-hypothesis|website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |accessdate=10 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=February 2016}} Examples would be more available green spaces in and around cities, more classes that revolve around nature and implementing smart design for greener cities that integrate ecosystems into them such as biophilic cities. These cities can also become part of wildlife corridors to help with migrational and territorial needs of other animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biophilic Cities | url=http://biophiliccities.org|website=Biophilic Cities|accessdate=10 Mar 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The hypothesis has since been developed as part of theories of [[evolutionary psychology]] in the book ''The Biophilia Hypothesis'' edited by Stephen R. Kellert and Edward O. Wilson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kellert|first=Stephen R. (ed.)|title=The Biophilia Hypothesis|publisher=[[Island Press]]|year=1993|isbn=1-55963-147-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Lynn Margulis]].  Also, Stephen Kellert's work seeks to determine common human responses to perceptions of, and ideas about, plants and animals, and to explain them in terms of the conditions of human evolution.

==Biophilic design==
In [[architecture]], biophilic design is a [[sustainable design]] strategy that incorporates reconnecting people with the natural environment. It may be seen as a necessary complement to [[Sustainable architecture|green architecture]], which decreases the environmental impact of the built world but does not address human reconnection with the natural world.&lt;ref name="kellert-film"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.stephenrkellert.net/biophilic-design.html | title=Biophilic Design: The Architecture of Life | work=www.stephenrkellert.net | accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Caperna and Serafini,&lt;ref&gt;Caperna A., Giangrande A., Mirabelli P., Mortola E., (2013). Partecipazione e ICT. Gangemi Editore  [http://www.gangemieditore.com/dettaglio/partecipazione-ict/4248/2] {{ISBN|9788849225365}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biophilic architecture is characterized by the following elements: i) the naturalistic dimension; (ii) the Wholeness &lt;ref&gt;C. Alexander, [[The Nature of Order|The Nature of Order: An Essay on the Art of Building and the Nature of the Universe]], Center for Environmental Structure, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; of the site, that is, "the basic structure of the place"; (iii) the "geometric coherency", that is, the physical space must have such a geometrical configuration able to exalt the connections human dimension and built and natural environments.
Similarly, biophilic space has been defined as the environment that strengthens life and supports the sociological and psychological components,&lt;ref&gt;	Serafini, S. (2009).

(ii) foster the optimum of our sensorial system in terms of neuro-motorial influence, avoiding both the depressive and the exciting effects; (iii) induce a strengthening in emotive and biological terms at a neural level; (iv) support, according to the many clinical evidences, the neuro-endocryne and immunological system, especially for those people who are in bad physical condition.

Having a window looking out to plants is also claimed to help speed up the healing process of patients in hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/nature-that-nurtures/ Windows looking out to plants helping the healing process]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, having plants in the same room as patients in hospitals also speeds up their healing process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmid=19715461 | doi=10.1089/acm.2009.0075 | volume=15 | title=Ornamental indoor plants in hospital rooms enhanced health outcomes of patients recovering from surgery | year=2009 | journal=J Altern Complement Med | pages=975–80 | last1 = Park | first1 = SH | last2 = Mattson | first2 = RH}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biophilia in fiction==
Canadian author [[Hilary Cunningham Scharper|Hilary Scharper]] explicitly adapted [[E. O. Wilson|E.O. Wilson]]'s  concept of biophilia for her ecogothic novel, ''Perdita''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Arousing Biophilia|url = http://arts.envirolink.org/interviews_and_conversations/EOWilson.html|website = arts.envirolink.org|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the novel, Perdita (meaning "the lost one") is a [[mythology|mythological figure]] who brings biophilia to humanity.

'''COMSTECH''' is an abbreviation for the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]]'s (OIC) Standing Committee on Scientific and Technological Cooperation for the promotion and cooperation of [[science]] and [[technology]] activities among the OIC member states. 
== Foundation ==
COMSTECH was established by the OIC's Islamic Summit in 1981 and comprises the OIC member states for the sake of building on indigenous capabilities in science and technology, promotion and cooperation in relevant areas, and establishment of institutional structure for [[planning]] and [[:Category:Development|development]] at [[Ummah]] level.

== Objectives ==
Their stated objectives are:
*Assessment of the human and material resources of OIC member states and determination of science and technology needs and requirements.
*Building up the indigenous capability of member states in the fields of science and technology through cooperation and mutual assistance.
*Promotion of cooperation and coordination amongst the member states in science and technology. Creation of an effective institutional structure of planning, research and development and monitoring of science and technology activities in high technology areas.

== Inter-Library Resource Network ==
The Inter-Library Resource Network Service is a programme that networks libraries of the OIC member states, requiring all member institutions to provide free access to the users of other members.&lt;ref name="rmj"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Medical Library Cooperation: a necessity | author = Midrar ullah, Librarian and Literature Search Officer Army Medical College | journal = Rawal Medical Journal | url = http://www.rmj.org.pk/RMJ_JAN_JUN_%202007/medical_education/med_librr.htm | issn = 0303-5212 | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | date = Jan–Jul 2007 | accessdate = 2009-11-24 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101208052841/http://www.rmj.org.pk/RMJ_JAN_JUN_%202007/medical_education/med_librr.htm# | archive-date = 2010-12-08 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7673">The '''CWTS Leiden Ranking''' is an annual global [[College and university rankings|university ranking]] based exclusively on [[bibliometrics|bibliometric]] indicators. The rankings are compiled by the Centre for Science and Technology Studies ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Centrum voor Wetenschap en Technologische Studies'', CWTS) at [[Leiden University]] in the [[Netherlands]]. The [[Thomson Reuters]] bibliographic database [[Web of Science]] is used as the source of the publication and citation data.&lt;ref name="data collection"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leidenranking.com/methodology/datacollection|title="Data collection", CWTS Leiden Ranking|publisher=Universiteit Leiden Centre for Science and Technology Studies |accessdate=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Leiden Ranking ranks universities worldwide by number of academic publications according to the volume and [[citation impact]] of the publications at those institutions.&lt;ref name="data collection" /&gt; The rankings take into account differences in language, [[Discipline (academia)|discipline]] and institutional size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v469/n7328/full/469034a.html | title=Non-English papers decrease rankings | first=Ton | last=van Raan | first2=Thed | last2=van Leeuwen | first3=Martijn |last3=Visser |journal=Nature | volume=469 | number=34 | date=2011-01-06 | doi=10.1038/469034a |accessdate=6 November 2011 | pages=34 | pmid=21209649}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple ranking lists are released according to various bibliometric normalization and impact indicators, including the number of publications, citations per publication, and field-normalized impact per publication.&lt;ref name="ranking"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leidenranking.com/ranking|title=Leiden Ranking |publisher=Universiteit Leiden Centre for Science and Technology Studies |accessdate=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to citation impact, the Leiding Ranking also ranks universities by scientific collaboration, including collaboration with other institutions and collaboration with an industry partner.&lt;ref name="indicators"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leidenranking.com/methodology/indicators|title="Indicators", CWTS Leiden Ranking|publisher=Universiteit Leiden Centre for Science and Technology Studies |accessdate=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first edition of the Leiden Ranking was produced in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Waltman, Ludo et al., [https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/19353/CWTS-WP-2012-007.pdf?sequence=1 ''The Leiden Ranking 2011/2012:  Data collection, indicators, and interpretation''], Centre for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS) , Leiden University, 16 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The 2014 rankings include 750 universities worldwide, which were selected based on the number of articles and reviews published by authors affiliated with those institutions in 2009–2012 in so-called "core" journals, a set of English-language journals with international scope and a "sufficiently large" number of references in the Web of Science database.&lt;ref name="data collection" /&gt;

== Results ==
[[File:Rockefeller University.JPG|thumb|[[Rockefeller University]] was ranked first in 2014 by [[citation impact]] ]]
As in other university rankings, Leiden's top 20 is heavily dominated by [[United States|American]] universities. In the 2014 rankings, [[Rockefeller University]] was first by citation impact, as measured by both mean citation score and mean normalized citation score, as well as by the proportion of papers belonging to the top 10% in their field. Notably, the [[University of Oxford]], the [[University of Cambridge]], and other  [[United Kingdom|British]] universities score much lower than in other university rankings, such as the [[Times Higher Education World University Rankings]] and [[QS World University Rankings]], which are based in part on reputational surveys among academics.&lt;ref name="ranking" /&gt;

When measuring by collaboration with other universities (the proportion of number of publications co-authored with other institutions), the top three spots were occupied by [[National Yang-Ming University]] and two other institutions from [[Taiwan]] in 2014, followed by universities from [[France]], the United Kingdom and a number of other European countries. [[King Abdulaziz University]] and [[King Saud University]] in [[Saudi Arabia]] led the list in 2014 when measured by international collaboration.&lt;ref name="ranking" /&gt;

== Indicators ==
The Leiden Ranking ranks universities by the following indicators:&lt;ref name="indicators" /&gt;

=== Citation impact ===
* '''MCS''' - mean citation score. The average number of citations of the publications of a university.
* '''MNCS''' - mean normalized citation score. The average number of citations of the publications of a university, normalized for field differences and publication year. For example, an MNCS value of 2 means that the publications of a university have been cited twice above world average.
* '''PP(top 10%)''' - proportion of top 10% publications. The proportion of the publications of a university that belong to the top 10% most frequently cited, compared with other publications in the same field and in the same year.

=== Scientific collaboration ===
* '''PP(collab)''' - proportion of interinstitutionally collaborative publications. The proportion of the publications of a university that have been co-authored with one or more other organizations.
* '''PP(int collab)''' - proportion of internationally collaborative publications. The proportion of the publications of a university that have been co-authored by two or more countries.
* '''PP(UI collab)''' - proportion of collaborative publications with industry. The proportion of the publications of a university that have been co-authored with one or more industrial partners. 
* '''PP(&lt;100&amp;nbsp;km)''' - proportion of short-distance collaborative publications. The proportion of the publications of a university with a geographical collaboration distance of less than 100&amp;nbsp;km.
* '''PP(&gt;1000&amp;nbsp;km)''' - proportion of long-distance collaborative publications. The proportion of the publications of a university with a geographical collaboration distance of more than 1000&amp;nbsp;km.

== Criticism ==
In a 2010 article, [[Loet Leydesdorff]] criticized the method used by the Leiden Ranking to normalize citation impact by subject field. The mean normalized citation score (MNCS) indicator is based on the ISI subject category classification used in Web of Science, which was "not designed for the scientometric evaluation, but for the purpose of information retrieval".&lt;ref&gt;Leydesdorff, Loet &amp; Opthof, Tobias, [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1003.3977.pdf ''Normalization, CWTS indicators, and the Leiden Rankings: Differences in citation behavior at the level of fields''], 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Also, normalizing at a higher aggregation level, rather than at the level of individual publications, gives more weight to older publications, particularly reviews, and to publications in fields where citation levels are traditionally higher.&lt;ref&gt;Andrejs Rauhvargers, [http://www.eua.be/pubs/global_university_rankings_and_their_impact.pdf ''Global University Rankings And Their Impact''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222105553/http://www.eua.be/pubs/global_university_rankings_and_their_impact.pdf# |date=2014-12-22 }}, European University Association, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Canopus Hill Observatory,''' located approximately 12&amp;nbsp;km from [[Hobart]] in [[Tasmania]] [[Australia]], is an optical astronomy observatory belonging to the University of Tasmania ([[University of Tasmania|UTAS]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.phys.utas.edu.au/Mount%20Canopus%20Observatory.html|title=Mount Canopus Observatory|website=www.phys.utas.edu.au|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the high southern latitude, the Canopus Hill Observatory is able to observe and study the Magellanic clouds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.phys.utas.edu.au/Mount%20Canopus%20Observatory.html|title=Mount Canopus Observatory|website=www.phys.utas.edu.au|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the observatory has closed down due to the "encroaching light pollution from the Hobart suburbs".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.utas.edu.au/maths-physics/internal-resources/telescopes/mt-canopus-observatory|title=Mt Canopus Observatory  - Mathematics &amp; Physics|last=shecanip|date=2012-04-16|website=www.utas.edu.au|language=en|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Astronomical Society, light pollution reduces the vision of the night sky, becoming a "major menace to amateur and professional astronomers alike".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asnsw.com/node/747|title=Light Pollution {{!}} The Astronomical Society|website=www.asnsw.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Telescope==

The Canopus Hill Observatory has a variety of telescope instrumentation, including a 2-channel high speed photometer with UBVR, clear filters, a CCD photometer with SITe 512x512 pixel illuminated backside-thinned CCD and quick change 6-channel filter wheel. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.utas.edu.au/maths-physics/internal-resources/telescopes/mt-canopus-observatory|title=Mt Canopus Observatory  - Mathematics &amp; Physics|last=shecanip|date=2012-04-16|website=www.utas.edu.au|language=en|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the UTAS, these telescope instrumentations are attached at the f/11 Cassegrain focus. In addition, there is also a 16" telescope that is used for observatory open nights for public viewing, photographic work and the Astronomical Society of Tasmania.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.phys.utas.edu.au/Mount%20Canopus%20Observatory.html|title=Mount Canopus Observatory|website=www.phys.utas.edu.au|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Critical Reconstruction''' is a [[theory]] of architecture and urbanism originally developed by the Berlin architect [[Josef Paul Kleihues]]. It was first applied in Berlin's [[International Building Exhibition Berlin|International Building Exhibition]] in the 1980s, and was subsequently used in the reconstruction of the city after the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] under Senate Building Director [[Hans Stimmann]]. Critical Reconstruction encouraged a return to traditional (pre-World War II) architectural styles and typologies, and sought to recreate the pedestrian-centered urban street life of the early twentieth-century European metropolis through the restoration of the inner city’s original baroque-era street plan.

Post-wall Critical Reconstruction in Berlin was closely associated with an architectural approach called "New Simplicity," theorized by [[Vittorio Magnago Lampugnani]] and championed by architect [[Hans Kollhoff]].

Hans Stimmann also used Critical Reconstruction as the basis for his ''[[Planwerk Innenstadt]]'', an inner-city development plan for Berlin that favored the demolition of mid-century buildings and the infill of empty plots with higher-density, mixed-use structures.

Major examples of Critical Reconstruction in Berlin include [[Potsdamer Platz]], the Friedrichstadt Passagen, and [[Alexanderplatz]].

[[File:Lden Schiphol.gif|thumb|right|Noise level map of the surroundings of [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol]]]]
The '''day–evening–night noise level''' or '''L{{sub|den}}''' is a 2002 [[European Union|European]] standard to express noise level over an entire day. It is calculated as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32002L0049&amp;from=EN|title=Directive 2002/49/EC|date=25 June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;L_{den} = 10 \cdot log_{10} \left(\frac{1}{24} \left(12\cdot 10 ^ \frac{L_{day}}{10} + 4\cdot 10 ^\frac{L_{evening} + 5}{10} + 8\cdot 10 ^\frac{L_{night} + 10}{10}\right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Where the long-term average noise levels are defined as:
{| class="wikitable
!Part of the day || hours || penalty (dB)
|-
| day || 6 - 18 || 0
|-
| evening || 18 - 22 || 5
|-
| night || 22 - 6 || 10
|}
The exact hours of the three periods may be chosen differently by individual EU member states.

'''Dharma Singh Khalsa''' is an American physician and medical researcher in the field of [[Alzheimer's Disease]].

==Early years==
Khalsa was born on January 20, 1946 in Cleveland, Ohio and grew up in Miami Beach, Florida.  He is a graduate of [[Creighton University School of Medicine]] in Omaha, Nebraska.  Dr. Khalsa received his training in Anesthesiology at the [[University of California, San Francisco]], where he was Chief Resident.  He is also a graduate of the University of California, Los Angeles Medical Acupuncture for Physicians Program and has studied mind/body medicine at [[Harvard Medical School]]'s Mind/Body Medical Institute.

In 1978 he started practicing Kundalini Yoga with [[Yogi Bhajan]], and in 1981 he embraced the [[Sikh]] lifestyle, complete with full beard, turban, and the Sikh name he has used ever since. (Khalsa and Stauth, p. xviii.)

Dharma Singh Khalsa grew up with [[asthma]].  An uncle, an esteemed cardiologist, prescribed a series of breathing exercises for him which helped immensely.  Even so, his lungs remained weak, and he was prone to bronchitis and even bronchial spasm in his early adulthood.  When, however, he began to practice Kundalini Yoga with a strong focus on breathing exercises, his vulnerability to lung problems ended. (Khalsa and Stauth, p.&amp;nbsp;214.)

==Work with holistic pain care==
In 1987, Dr. Khalsa established the first holistic pain program in the Southwestern United States at Lovelace Medical Center in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]].  In 1990, he was recruited to become the founding director of the Acupuncture, Stress Medicine, and Chronic Pain Program at the University of Arizona, College of Medicine's teaching hospital in Phoenix, Arizona.  In this position, he became the first director of acupuncture in an American medical school.

==Work on Alzheimer's disease==
Since 1993, Dr. Khalsa has been the President and Medical Director of the Alzheimer's Research and Prevention Foundation in Tucson, Arizona, the original voice in the integrative medical approach to the prevention and treatment of memory loss.

In 2003, Dharma Singh Khalsa, M.D. testified before Congress about his pioneering work in the area of lifestyle influence on Alzheimer's disease, and called on Congress to fund a national education and outreach campaign designed to inform the public of the benefits of an integrative medical approach to Alzheimer's.  After his testimony, Dr. Khalsa received the support of U.S. Surgeon General [[Richard H. Carmona]], M.D.

==Publications==
Dr. Khalsa has written widely on a wide range of health and healing issues.  His book Brain Longevity (Warner Books, 1997) is the original work of its kind to be written for the general public, and has been translated into twelve languages.  Dr. Khalsa has also authored six other books for the general public, as well as several medical textbook chapters, including one for [[Harvard Medical School]] and one for the [[University of Arizona]].

==Family life==

Dharma Singh Khalsa, M.D. currently lives in [[Tucson]], [[Arizona]] with his Italian wife, Kirti.  He has a son, Sat Kartar, a holistic chef, married to Chilean KamalCharan Kaur, and a grandson, Simranpreet Singh Khalsa.  Dr. Khalsa's daughter Hari is an accomplished massage therapist, trained in Thailand.

'''Emotional Freedom Techniques''' ('''EFT''') is a form of [[Intervention (counseling)|counseling intervention]] that draws on various theories of [[alternative medicine]] including [[acupuncture]], [[neuro-linguistic programming]], [[energy medicine]], and [[Thought Field Therapy]] (TFT).  It is best known through '''Gary Craig'''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s ''EFT Handbook'', published in the late 1990s, and related books and workshops by a variety of teachers.  EFT and similar techniques are often discussed under the umbrella term "[[energy psychology]]".

Advocates claim that the technique may be used to treat a wide variety of physical and psychological disorders, and as a simple form of self-administered therapy.&lt;ref name="manual"&gt;{{Cite book | title = EFT Manual | last = Craig | format = pdf | first = G | url = http://www.spiritual-web.com/downloads/eftmanual.pdf | date = n.d. | accessdate = 2011-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'' describes the foundations of EFT as "a hodgepodge of concepts derived from a variety of sources, [primarily] the ancient Chinese philosophy of [[Qi|chi]], which is thought to be the 'life force' that flows throughout the body." The existence of this life force is "not empirically supported".&lt;ref name="csicop" /&gt;

EFT has no benefit as a therapy beyond the [[placebo effect]] or any known-effective psychological techniques that may be provided in addition to the purported "energy" technique.&lt;ref name=Bakker/&gt; It is generally characterized as [[pseudoscience]] and it has not garnered significant support in clinical psychology.&lt;ref name=Delphi/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guilford/&gt;&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;

==Process==
[[File:Eft punkte.jpg|thumb|''EFT-tapping points''&lt;ref name="manual"/&gt;]]
During a typical EFT session, the person will focus on a specific issue while tapping on "[[acupuncture point|end points of the body's energy meridians]]".

According to the EFT manual, the procedure consists of the participant rating the emotional intensity of their reaction on a [[Subjective Units of Distress Scale]] (SUDS) (a [[Likert scale]] for subjective measures of distress, calibrated 0-10) then repeating an orienting [[Affirmations (New Age)|affirmation]] while rubbing or tapping specific points on the body. Some practitioners incorporate eye movements or other tasks. The emotional intensity is then rescored and repeated until no changes are noted in the emotional intensity.&lt;ref name="manual"/&gt;

==Mechanism==

Proponents of EFT and other similar treatments believe that tapping/stimulating acupuncture points provide the basis for significant improvement in psychological problems.&lt;ref name=Feinstein/&gt; However, the theory and mechanisms underlying the supposed effectiveness of EFT have "no evidentiary support" "in the entire history of the sciences of biology, anatomy, physiology, neurology, physics, or psychology." Researchers have described the theoretical model for EFT as "frankly bizarre" and "pseudoscientific."&lt;ref name=Bakker/&gt;  One review noted that one of the highest quality studies found no evidence that the location of tapping points made any difference, and attributed effects to well-known psychological mechanisms, including distraction and breathing therapy.&lt;ref name=Bakker/&gt;&lt;ref name="srmhp"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.srmhp.org/0201/emotional-freedom-technique.html | title=Assessment of the Emotional Freedom Technique |author1=Waite, Wendy L |author2=Holder, Mark D | journal=Scientific Review of Mental Health Practice | year=2003 | volume=2 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article in the ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'' argued that there is no plausible mechanism to explain how the specifics of EFT could add to its effectiveness, and they have been described as [[Falsifiability|unfalsifiable]] and therefore [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]].&lt;ref name="csicop"&gt;{{cite journal | accessdate = 2011-12-12 | url = http://www.csicop.org/si/show/can_we_really_tap_our_problems_away_a_critical_analysis_of_thought_field_th/ | title=Can we really tap our problems away? |vauthors=Gaudiano BA, Herbert JD | journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] | year=2000 | volume=24 | issue=4 | format=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence has not been found for the existence of [[meridian (Chinese medicine)|meridians]].&lt;ref name = Ernst&gt;{{cite book | last = Singh | first = S | authorlink = Simon Singh |author2=Ernst E |authorlink2=Edzard Ernst  | year = 2008 | title = [[Trick or Treatment|Trick or treatment: The undeniable facts about alternative medicine]] | isbn = 978-0-393-06661-6 | publisher = [[W.

== Research quality ==

EFT has no useful effect as a therapy beyond the placebo effect or any known-effective psychological techniques that may be used with the purported "energy" technique, but proponents of EFT have published material claiming otherwise. Their work, however, is flawed and hence unreliable: high-quality research has never confirmed that EFT is effective.&lt;ref name=Bakker&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bakker|first=Gary M.|title=The current status of energy psychology: Extraordinary claims with less than ordinary evidence|journal=Clinical Psychologist|date=November 2013|volume=17|issue=3|pages=91–99|doi=10.1111/cp.12020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 review found "methodological flaws" in research studies that had reported "small successes" for EFT and the related [[Tapas Acupressure Technique]]. The review concluded that positive results may be "attributable to well-known cognitive and behavioral techniques that are included with the energy manipulation. Psychologists and researchers should be wary of using such techniques, and make efforts to inform the public about the ill effects of therapies that advertise miraculous claims."&lt;ref name=McCaslin&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Psychotherapy (Chicago) |date=June 2009 |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=249–56 |title=A review of efficacy claims in energy psychology |author=McCaslin DL |pmid=22122622 |doi=10.1037/a0016025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 systematic review found that EFT was effective in reducing [[anxiety]] compared to controls, but also called for more research comparing its effectiveness to that of established treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Clond |first=Morgan |date=May 2016 |title=Emotional Freedom Techniques for Anxiety: A Systematic Review With Meta-analysis |journal=The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease |volume=204 |issue=5 |pages=388–395 |doi=10.1097/NMD.0000000000000483 |issn=1539-736X |pmid=26894319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

A [[Delphi method|Delphi]] poll of an expert panel of psychologists rated EFT on a scale describing how discredited EFT has been in the field of psychology.  On average, this panel found EFT had a score of 3.8 on a scale from 1.0 to 5.0, with 3.0 meaning "possibly discredited" and a 4.0 meaning "probably discredited."&lt;ref name=Delphi&gt;{{cite journal|last=Norcross|first=John C.|author2=Koocher, Gerald P. |author3=Garofalo, Ariele |title=Discredited psychological treatments and tests: A Delphi poll.|journal=Professional Psychology: Research and Practice|date=1 January 2006|volume=37|issue=5|pages=515–522|doi=10.1037/0735-7028.37.5.515}}&lt;/ref&gt; A book examining pseudoscientific practices in psychology characterized EFT as one of a number of "fringe psychotherapeutic practices",&lt;ref name=Guilford&gt;{{cite book|first=Scott O. |last=Lilienfeld|title=Science and pseudoscience in clinical psychology|year=2003|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=1-57230-828-1|pages=2|edition=Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a psychiatry handbook states EFT has "all the hallmarks of [[pseudoscience]]".&lt;ref name=Oxford&gt;{{cite book|first=David |last=Semple|title=Oxford Handbook of Psychiatry|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=978-0-19-969388-7|pages=393}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EFT, along with its predecessor, Thought Field Therapy, has been dismissed with warnings to avoid their use by publications such as ''[[The Skeptic's Dictionary]]''&lt;ref name=skepdic&gt;{{cite web|title=Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT)|url=http://www.skepdic.com/eft.html|accessdate=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Quackwatch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barrett|first=Stephen|title=Mental Help: Procedures to Avoid|url=http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/mentserv.html|accessdate=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of EFT and other energy psychology therapies have been "particularly interested" in seeking "scientific credibility" despite the implausible proposed mechanisms for EFT.&lt;ref name = Bakker/&gt;  A 2008 review by energy psychology proponent David Feinstein concluded that energy psychology was a potential "rapid and potent treatment for a range of psychological conditions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feinstein|first=D|title=Energy psychology: A review of the preliminary evidence.|journal=Psychotherapy (Chicago, Ill.)|date=Jun 2008|volume=45|issue=2|pages=199–213|pmid=22122417|doi=10.1037/0033-3204.45.2.199}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this work by Feinstein has been widely criticized. One review criticized Feinstein's methodology, noting he ignored several research papers that did not show positive effects of EFT, and that Feinstein did not disclose his [[conflict of interest]] as an owner of a website that sells energy psychology products such as books and seminars, contrary to the best practices of research publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pignotti|first=M|author2=Thyer, B|title=Some comments on "Energy psychology: A review of the evidence": Premature conclusions based on incomplete evidence?|journal=Psychotherapy (Chicago, Ill.)|date=Jun 2009|volume=46|issue=2|pages=257–61|pmid=22122623|doi=10.1037/a0016027}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another review criticized Feinstein's conclusion, which was based on research of weak quality and instead concluded that any positive effects of EFT are due to the more traditional psychological techniques rather than any putative "energy" manipulation.&lt;ref name=McCaslin/&gt;  A book published on the subject of [[evidence-based medicine|evidence-based]] treatment of substance abuse called Feinstein's review "incomplete and misleading" and an example of a poorly performed evidence-based review of research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=editors|first=Katherine van Wormer, Bruce A.

Feinstein published another review in 2012, concluding that energy psychology techniques "consistently demonstrated strong effect sizes and other positive statistical results that far exceed chance after relatively few treatment sessions".&lt;ref name="Feinstein"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/gpr/16/4/364/ | title=Acupoint stimulation in treating psychological disorders: Evidence of efficacy | author=Feinstein, David | journal=Review of General Psychology |date=December 2012  | volume=16 | issue=4 | pages=364–380 | doi=10.1037/a0028602}}&lt;/ref&gt; This review was also criticized, where again it was noted that Feinstein dismissed higher quality studies which showed no effects of EFT, in favor of methodologically weaker studies which did show a positive effect.&lt;ref name=Bakker/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2099">'''Evolved gas analysis''' ('''EGA''') is a method used to study the gas evolved from a heated sample that undergoes decomposition or [[desorption]]. It is either possible just to detect evolved gases using evolved gas detection (EGD) or to analyse explicitly which gases evolved using evolved gas analysis (EGA).&lt;ref&gt;&gt;{{cite book|last=Wendlandt|first=Wesley Wm.|title=Thermal methods of analysis|date=1974|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|isbn=0-471-93366-X|pages=319–359|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefor different analytical methods can be employed such as [[mass spectrometry]], [[Fourier transform spectroscopy]], [[gas chromatography]], or optical in-situ evolved gas analysis.

By coupling the thermal analysis instrument, e. g. TGA ([[thermogravimetry]]) or DSC ([[differential scanning calorimetry]]), with a fast Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer (QMS) the detection of gas separation and identification of the separated components are possible in exact time correlation with the other thermal analysis signals. DSC/TGA-QMS or TGA-QMS yields information on the composition (mass numbers of elements and molecules) of the evolved gases. It allows fast and easy interpretation of atomic/inorganic vapors and standard gases like H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, etc. Fragmentation, interpretation of organic molecules is sometimes difficult.

The combination with an FTIR (Fourier transform infrared spectrometer) has become popular, especially in the polymer producing, chemical and pharmaceutical industry. DSC/TGA-FTIR or TGA-FTIR yields information on the composition (absorption bands) of the evolved gases (bonding conditions). The advantage is an easy interpretation (spectra data bases) of organic vapors without fragmentation. Symmetrical molecules can not be detected.

An EGA instrument named the Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer was flown on the [[Phoenix Lander]] probe that reached Mars in May 2008. Its purpose was to study Martian soil samples. {{Citation needed |date= December 2017 }}

'''Explorer 52''' was an [[United States|American]] [[satellite]] launched on June 3, 1974 from [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] on a Scout booster.&lt;ref name=NSSDC-1974-040A&gt;{{cite web|title=NSSDC/COSPAR ID: 1974-040A|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/masterCatalog.do?sc=1974-040A|website=NSSDC Master Catalog Search|publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This satellite was also known as:
* Hawkeye 1
* IE D
* Injun 6
* Injun F
* Neutral Point Explorer
* 07325

==Mission==
The primary mission objective of Hawkeye 1 (Explorer 52) was to conduct particles and fields investigations of the polar magnetosphere of the earth out to 21 earth radii. Secondary objectives were to make magnetic field and plasma distribution measurements in the solar wind, and to study Type-3 radio emissions caused by solar electron streams in the interplanetary medium. To accomplish these objectives, the spacecraft was instrumented with following instruments:  
* a [[plasma wave]] receiver,&lt;ref&gt;http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experimentDisplay.do?id=1974-040A-03 ELF/VLF Receivers&lt;/ref&gt;
* a [[fluxgate magnetometer]],&lt;ref&gt;http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experimentDisplay.do?id=1974-040A-01 Triaxial  Fluxgate Magnetometer&lt;/ref&gt; and
* a low energy proton-electron differential energy analyzer.&lt;ref&gt;http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experimentDisplay.do?id=1974-040A-02 Low-Energy Protons and Electrons&lt;/ref&gt;

The spacecraft was [[spin-stabilized satellite|spin stabilized]] with a nominal rotational period of 11 s. In [[celestial coordinates]], the positive spin axis coordinates were [[right ascension]] 299.4 degrees (plus or minus 1.1 deg) and [[declination]] 8.6 deg (plus or minus 1.5 deg). There was no onboard orientation or spin rate control, but the orientation of the spin axis was stable. An optical aspect system operated from launch until September 3, 1974 at which time the optical aspect system was turned off and failed to turn back on. After this period, aspect had to be determined by observing the effect of optical illumination from the sun on a plasma measurement system. Using the sharp peak observed in this data, corrected orientation information was obtained and rewritten to the data records. The complete spacecraft with instruments had a mass of {{convert|22.65|kg|lb}}. Power of 22 to 36 W, depending on solar aspect, was obtained from solar cells. Hawkeye 1 participated in the International Magnetospheric Study (IMS) and during the first half of 1977 data acquisition was confined to IMS special intervals. Data were obtained in real time only, at frequencies of 136 and 400&amp;nbsp;MHz at 100 bit/s (or 200 bit/s with convolutional coding) plus wideband VLF data.

==Specifics==
It was designed, built, and tracked by personnel at the Department of Physics and Astronomy, [[University of Iowa]] whose sports teams are the Hawkeyes. The spacecraft was launched on June 3, 1974 into a polar orbit with initial apogee over the North Pole and re-entered on April 28, 1978 after 667 orbits or nearly four years of continuous operation. The spacecraft apogee was between 20.28 and 20.92 Earth radii with less than a 1.7 Earth radii perigee. The orbital period was 51.3 hours. During its lifetime, the inclination of the plane of the spacecraft's orbit to the Earth's equator decreased monotonically from 89.81 to 81.85 degrees. The spacecraft's axis of rotation at launch was inertially fixed in its orbital plane, directed towards a constant right ascension and declination, and nearly parallel to the Earth's equatorial plane.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7651">A '''fuzzy set operation''' is an [[Operation (mathematics)|operation]] on [[fuzzy sets]].  These operations are generalization of [[crisp set]] operations. There is more than one possible generalization.  The most widely used operations are called ''standard fuzzy set operations''.  There are three operations:  [[Fuzzy set operations#Fuzzy complements|fuzzy complement]]s, [[Fuzzy set operations#Fuzzy intersections|fuzzy intersection]]s, and [[Fuzzy set operations#Fuzzy unions|fuzzy union]]s.

==Standard fuzzy set operations==
Let A and B be fuzzy sets that A,B ⊆ U, u is any element (e.g. value) in the U universe: u ∈ U.

;Standard complement
:&lt;math&gt;\mu_{\lnot{A}}(u) = 1 - \mu_A(u)&lt;/math&gt;
The complement is sometimes denoted by '''∁'''A or A&lt;sup&gt;'''∁'''&lt;/sup&gt; instead of '''¬'''A.

;Standard intersection
:&lt;math&gt;\mu_{A \cap B}(u) = \min\{\mu_A(u), \mu_B(u)\}&lt;/math&gt;

;Standard union
:&lt;math&gt;\mu_{A \cup B}(u) = \max\{\mu_A(u), \mu_B(u)\}&lt;/math&gt;

In general, the triple (i,u,n) is called '''[[t-norm#Non-standard negators|De Morgan Triplet]]''' [[iff]]
* i is a [[t-norm#Definition|t-norm]],
* u is a [[t-norm#T-conorms|t-conorm]] (aka s-norm),
* n is a [[t-norm#Non-standard negators|strong negator]],
so that for all ''x'',''y'' ∈ [0, 1] the following holds true: 
:''u''(''x'',''y'') = ''n''(''i''(''n''(''x''), ''n''(''y'')) 
(generalized De Morgan relation).&lt;ref&gt;Ismat Beg, Samina Ashraf: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228744370_Similarity_measures_for_fuzzy_sets Similarity measures for fuzzy sets], at: Applied and Computational Mathematics, March 2009, available on Research Gate since November 23rd, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; This implies the axioms provided below in detail.

==Fuzzy complements==
''μ&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'') is defined as the degree to which ''x'' belongs to ''A''. Let ''∁A'' denote a fuzzy complement of ''A'' of type ''c''. Then ''μ&lt;sub&gt;∁A&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'') is the degree to which ''x'' belongs to ''∁A'', and the degree to which ''x'' does not belong to ''A''. (''μ&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'') is therefore the degree to which ''x'' does not belong to ''∁A''.) Let a complement '''''∁'''A'' be defined by a function

:''c'' : [0,1] → [0,1]

:For all ''x'' ∈ ''U'':  ''μ&lt;sub&gt;∁A&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'') = ''c''(''μ&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x''))

===Axioms for fuzzy complements===
;Axiom c1. ''Boundary condition''
:''c''(0) = 1 and ''c''(1) = 0

;Axiom c2. ''Monotonicity''
:For all ''a'', ''b'' ∈ [0, 1], if ''a'' &lt; ''b'', then ''c''(''a'') &gt; ''c''(''b'')

;Axiom c3. ''Continuity''
:''c'' is continuous function.

;Axiom c4. ''Involutions'' 
:''c'' is an [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]], which means that ''c''(''c''(''a'')) = ''a'' for each ''a'' ∈ [0,1]
''c'' is a ''strong [[T-norm#Non-standard negators|negator]]'' (aka ''fuzzy complement'').

A function c satisfying axioms c1 and c2 has at least one fixpoint a&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; with c(a&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;) = a&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;,
and if axiom c3 is fulfilled as well there is exactly one such fixpoint. For the standard negator c(x) = 1-x the unique fixpoint is a&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.5 .&lt;ref name="GR2009-2010"&gt;Günther Rudolph: [https://ls11-www.cs.tu-dortmund.de/people/rudolph/teaching/lectures/CI/WS2009-10/lec06.pps Computational Intelligence (PPS)], TU Dortmund, Algorithm Engineering LS11, Winter Term 2009/10. Note that this power point sheet may have some problems with special character rendering&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fuzzy intersections==
{{main|T-norm}}
The intersection of two fuzzy sets ''A'' and ''B'' is specified in general by a binary operation on the unit interval, a function of the form      
  
:''i'':[0,1]×[0,1] → [0,1].

:For all ''x'' ∈ ''U'':  ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;''A'' ∩ ''B''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') = ''i''[''μ&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x''), ''μ&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'')].

===Axioms for fuzzy intersection===
;Axiom i1. ''Boundary condition''
:''i''(''a'', 1) = ''a''

;Axiom i2. ''Monotonicity''
:''b'' ≤ ''d'' implies ''i''(''a'', ''b'') ≤ ''i''(''a'', ''d'')

;Axiom i3. ''Commutativity''
:''i''(''a'', ''b'') = ''i''(''b'', ''a'')

;Axiom i4. ''Associativity''
:''i''(''a'', ''i''(''b'', ''d'')) = ''i''(''i''(''a'', ''b''), ''d'')

;Axiom i5. ''Continuity''
:''i'' is a continuous function

;Axiom i6. ''Subidempotency''
:''i''(''a'', ''a'') ≤ ''a''

;Axiom i7. ''Strict monotonicity''
:''i'' (''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) ≤ ''i'' (''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) if ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and  ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Axioms i1 up to i4 define a '''t-norm''' (aka '''fuzzy intersection'''). The standard t-norm min is the only idempotent t-norm (that is, ''i'' (''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''a'' for all ''a'' ∈ [0,1]).&lt;ref name="GR2009-2010" /&gt;

FUZZY UNION
The union of two fuzzy sets ''A'' and ''B'' is specified in general by a binary operation on the unit interval function of the form

:''u'':[0,1]×[0,1] → [0,1].

:For all ''x'' ∈ ''U'':  ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;''A'' ∪ ''B''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') = ''u''[''μ&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x''), ''μ&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'')].

===Axioms for fuzzy union===
;Axiom u1.  ''Boundary condition''
:''u''(''a'', 0) =''u''(0 ,''a'') = ''a''

;Axiom u2. ''Monotonicity''
:''b'' ≤ ''d'' implies ''u''(''a'', ''b'') ≤ ''u''(''a'', ''d'')

;Axiom u3. ''Commutativity''
:''u''(''a'', ''b'') = ''u''(''b'', ''a'')

;Axiom u4. ''Associativity''
:''u''(''a'', ''u''(''b'', ''d'')) = ''u''(''u''(''a, ''b''), ''d'')

;Axiom u5. ''Continuity''
:''u'' is a continuous function

;Axiom u6. ''Superidempotency''
:''u''(''a'', ''a'') ≥ ''a''

;Axiom u7. ''Strict monotonicity''
:''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  implies ''u''(''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) &lt; ''u''(''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)

Axioms u1 up to u4 define a '''t-conorm''' (aka '''s-norm''' or '''fuzzy intersection'''). The standard t-conorm max is the only idempotent t-conorm (i. e. u (a1, a1) = a for all a ∈ [0,1]).&lt;ref name="GR2009-2010" /&gt;

==Aggregation operations==
Aggregation operations on fuzzy sets are operations by which several fuzzy sets are combined in a desirable way to produce a single fuzzy set.

Aggregation operation on ''n'' fuzzy set (2 ≤ ''n'') is defined by a function

:''h'':[0,1]&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; → [0,1]

===Axioms for aggregation operations fuzzy sets===
;Axiom h1. ''Boundary condition''
:''h''(0, 0, ..., 0) = 0  and  ''h''(1, 1, ..., 1) = one

;Axiom h2. ''Monotonicity''
:For any pair &lt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&gt; and &lt;''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&gt; of ''n''-tuples such that ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ [0,1] for all ''i'' ∈ ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, if ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; for all ''i'' ∈ ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, then ''h''(''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...,''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) ≤ ''h''(''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;); that is, ''h'' is monotonic increasing in all its arguments.

;Axiom h3. ''Continuity''
:''h'' is a continuous function.

{{genetic genealogy}}
'''Genetic genealogy''' is the use of DNA testing in combination with traditional [[Genealogy|genealogical methods]]  to infer relationships between individuals and find ancestors.  Genetic genealogy involves the use of [[genealogical DNA test]]ing to determine the level and type of the [[Genetic distance (individuals)|genetic relationship]] between individuals. This application of genetics became popular with family historians in the 21st century, as tests became affordable. The tests have been promoted by amateur groups, such as [[Surname DNA project|surname study groups]], or regional genealogical groups, as well as research projects such as the [[genographic project]]. As of 2018, 18.5 million people had been tested. As this field has developed, the aims of practitioners broadened, with many seeking knowledge of their ancestry beyond the recent centuries for which traditional pedigrees can be constructed.{{toc limit}}

==History==
[[Image:George Darwin sepia tone.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[George Darwin]] was the first to estimate the frequency of [[first-cousin marriage]]s]]
The investigation of [[surname]]s in genetics can be said to go back to [[George Darwin]], a son of [[Charles Darwin]]. In 1875, George Darwin used surnames to estimate the frequency of [[first-cousin marriage]]s and calculated the expected incidence of marriage between people of the same surname ([[isonymy]]). He arrived at a figure between 2.25% and 4.5% for cousin-marriage in the population of Great Britain, higher among the upper classes and lower among the general rural population.&lt;ref name=Darwin1875 /&gt;

===Surname studies===

One famous study examined the lineage of descendants of [[Thomas Jefferson]]’s paternal line and male lineage descendants of the freed slave, [[Sally Hemmings]].&lt;ref name=Jefferson /&gt;

[[Bryan Sykes]], a molecular biologist at [[Oxford University]] tested the new methodology in general surname research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cruwys.blogspot.com/2018/03/farewell-to-oxford-ancestors.html|title=Farewell to Oxford Ancestors|last=Kennett|first=Debbie|date=2018-03-14|website=Cruwys news|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; His study of the Sykes surname obtained results by looking at four STR markers on the male chromosome. It pointed the way to genetics becoming a valuable assistant in the service of genealogy and history.&lt;ref name=Sykes /&gt;

===Direct to consumer DNA testing===
{{main|Genealogical DNA testing}}
The first company to provide direct-to-consumer genetic DNA testing was the now defunct [[GeneTree]]. However, it did not offer multi-generational genealogy tests. In fall 2001, GeneTree sold its assets to Salt Lake City-based [[Sorenson Molecular Genealogy Foundation]] (SMGF) which originated in 1999.&lt;ref name=Wayne2006 /&gt; While in operation, SMGF provided free Y-Chromosome and mitochondrial DNA tests to thousands.&lt;ref name=Blaine2006 /&gt; Later, GeneTree returned to genetic testing for genealogy in conjunction with the Sorenson parent company and eventually was part of the assets acquired in the [[Ancestry.com]] buyout of SMGF.&lt;ref name=SMGF2012 /&gt;

In 2000, [[Family Tree DNA]], founded by [[Bennett Greenspan]] and Max Blankfeld, was the first company dedicated to direct-to-consumer testing for genealogy research. They initially offered eleven marker Y-Chromosome STR tests and HVR1 mitochondrial DNA tests. They originally tested in partnership with the University of Arizona.&lt;ref name=Belli /&gt;&lt;ref name=NGSQ2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lomax/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dardashti/&gt;&lt;ref name=HBJ2008/&gt;

In 2007, [[23andMe]] was the first company to offer a [[saliva]]-based [[Genetic testing#Direct-to-consumer genetic testing|direct-to-consumer genetic testing]].&lt;ref name = Time&gt;{{Cite news|last=Hamilton|first=Anita|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1852747_1854493,00.html | title = Best Inventions of 2008 | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date=October 29, 2008 | accessdate = April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the first to implement using autosomal DNA for ancestry testing, which all other major companies now use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mediacenter.23andme.com/company/about-us/ |title=About Us |website=23andMe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=https://isogg.org/wiki/Autosomal_DNA_testing_comparison_chart |title=Autosomal DNA testing comparison chart |website=International Society of Genetic Genealogy Wiki |last1=Janzen |first1=Tim |author2=et al. |chapter=Family Tree DNA Learning Center |publisher=Gene by Gene }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2018, large DNA genealogy companies had over 18.5 million profiles. GEDmatch said about half of their profiles were American.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/.premium.MAGAZINE-to-solve-cold-cases-all-it-takes-is-dna-a-genealogy-site-and-high-speed-internet-1.6657176|title=To Solve Cold Cases, All It Takes Is Crime Scene DNA, a Genealogy Site and High-speed Internet|last=Michaeli|first=Yarden|date=2018-11-16|work=Haaretz|access-date=2018-11-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/610233/2017-was-the-year-consumer-dna-testing-blew-up/|title=2017 was the year consumer DNA testing blew up|last=Regalado|first=Antonio|date=2018-02-12|work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2018-02-20|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The genetic genealogy revolution===
The publication of ''[[The Seven Daughters of Eve]]'' by Sykes in 2001, which described the seven major haplogroups of European ancestors, helped push personal ancestry testing through DNA tests into wide public notice. With the growing availability and affordability of genealogical DNA testing, genetic genealogy as a field grew rapidly. By 2003, the field of DNA testing of surnames was declared officially to have “arrived” in an article by Jobling and Tyler-Smith in ''Nature Reviews Genetics''.&lt;ref name=Jobling2003 /&gt; The number of firms offering tests, and the number of consumers ordering them, rose dramatically.&lt;ref name=Deboeck /&gt; In 2018 a paper in [[Science (journal)|Science Magazine]] estimated that a DNA genealogy search on anybody of European descent would result in a third cousin or closer match 60% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Erlich|first=Yaniv|last2=Shor|first2=Tal|last3=Pe’er|first3=Itsik|last4=Carmi|first4=Shai|date=2018-11-09|title=Identity inference of genomic data using long-range familial searches|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/362/6415/690|journal=Science|language=en|volume=362|issue=6415|pages=690–694|doi=10.1126/science.aau4832|issn=0036-8075|pmid=30309907}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Genographic Project===
{{main|Genographic Project}}
{{Update|section|date=September 2013}}
The original [[Genographic Project]] was a five-year research study launched in 2005 by the [[National Geographic Society]] and [[IBM]], in partnership with the University of Arizona and Family Tree DNA. Its goals were primarily anthropological. The project announced that by April 2010 it had sold more than 350,000 of its public participation testing kits, which test the general public for either twelve [[Genealogical DNA test#STR markers|STR markers]] on the [[Y chromosome|Y-Chromosome]] or mutations on the [[Hypervariable region|HVR1 region]] of the [[mtDNA]].&lt;ref name=NatGeo /&gt;

In 2007, annual sales of genetic genealogical tests for all companies, including the laboratories that support them, were estimated to be in the area of $60 million (2006).&lt;ref name=Blaine2006 /&gt;

The current phase of the project is Geno 2.0 Next Generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About the Genographic Project - National Geographic |url=https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/about/ |website=Genographic Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018, almost one-million participants in over 140 countries have joined the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=National Geographic Geno DNA Ancestry Kit {{!}} Human Migration, Population Genetics |url=https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/ |website=Genographic Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Typical customers and interest groups===
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2013}}
Genetic genealogy has enabled groups of people to trace their ancestry even though they are not able to use conventional genealogical techniques. This may be because they do not know one or both of their birth parents or because conventional genealogical records have been lost, destroyed or never existed. These groups include  adoptees, foundlings, Holocaust survivors, GI babies, child migrants, descendants of children from orphan trains and people with slave ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/06/how-african-americans-use-dna-testing-to-connect-with-their-past/531834/ How African Americans Use DNA Testing to Connect With Their Past]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://isogg.org/wiki/Utilizing_DNA_testing_to_break_through_adoption_roadblocks Utilizing DNA testing to break through adoption roadblocks]&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest test takers were customers most often those who started with a Y-Chromosome test to determine their [[Patrilineality|father's paternal ancestry]]. These men often took part in [[Surname DNA project|surname projects]]. The first phase of the Genographic project brought new participants into genetic genealogy. Those who tested were as likely to be interested in direct maternal heritage as their paternal. The number of those taking mtDNA tests increased. The introduction of autosomal SNP tests based on [[microarray chip]] technology changed the demographics. Women were as likely as men to test themselves.

===Citizen science and ISOGG===
{{further|International Society of Genetic Genealogy|Conversion_table_for_Y_chromosome_haplogroups{{!}}Y-chromosome haplogroup trees}}
Members of the growing genetic genealogy community have been credited with making useful contributions to knowledge in the field.&lt;ref name=Redmonds&gt;{{cite book|last=Redmonds|first=George|title=Surnames, DNA, and Family History|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199582648|page=196|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tQRMzEcIb2gC|author2=King, Turi |author3=Hey, David |quote=The growth of interest in genetic genealogy has inspired a group of individuals outside the academic area who are passionate about the subject and who have an impressive grasp of the research issues. Two focal points for this group are the International Society of Genetic Genealogy and the ''Journal of Genetic Genealogy''. The ISOGG is a non-profit, non-commercial organization that provides resources and maintains one of the most up-to-date, if not completely academically verified, phylogenetic trees of Y chromosome haplogroups.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest interest groups to emerge was the [[International Society of Genetic Genealogy]] (ISOGG). Their stated goal is to promote [[Genealogical DNA test|DNA testing for genealogy]].&lt;ref name=ISOGG /&gt; Members advocate the use of [[genetics]] in [[Genealogy|genealogical research]] and the group facilitates networking among genetic genealogists.&lt;ref name=KingJobling /&gt; Since 2006 ISOGG has maintained the regularly updated ISOGG [[Y chromosome|Y-chromosome]] [[phylogenetic tree]].&lt;ref name=KingJobling /&gt;&lt;ref name=ISOGG2006 /&gt; ISOGG aims to keep the tree as up-to-date as possible, incorporating new [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|SNP]]s.&lt;ref name=Athey/&gt; However, the tree has been described by academics as not completely academically verified, phylogenetic trees of Y chromosome haplogroups.&lt;ref name=Larmuseau/&gt;

=== Autosomal DNA 2007-present ===
In 2007, [[23andMe]] was the first major company to begin offering a test of the autosome. This is the DNA excluding the Y-chromosomes and mitochondria. It is inherited from all ancestors in recent generations and so can be used to match with other testers who may be related. Later on, companies were also able to use this data to estimate how much of each ethnicity a customer has. FamilyTreeDNA entered this market in 2010, and AncestryDNA in 2012. Since then the number of DNA tests has expanded rapidly. By 2017, the combined totals of customers at the four largest companies was nearly 10 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blogs.ancestry.com/ancestry/2017/11/02/continued-commitment-to-customer-privacy-and-control/ |title=Continued Commitment to Customer Privacy and Control |website=Ancestry Blog |date=November 2, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mediacenter.23andme.com/company/about-us/ |title=About Us |website=23andMe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=https://isogg.org/wiki/Autosomal_DNA_testing_comparison_chart |title=Autosomal DNA testing comparison chart |website=International Society of Genetic Genealogy Wiki |last1=Janzen |first1=Tim |author2=et al. |chapter=Family Tree DNA Learning Center |publisher=Gene by Gene }}&lt;/ref&gt; Autosomal testing is now the dominant type of genealogical DNA test, and for many companies the only test they offer.

==Uses==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2018}}
===Direct maternal lineages===
{{details|Genealogical_DNA_test#Mitochondrial_DNA_.28mtDNA.29_testing{{!}}Genealogical DNA Test - Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) testing}}
mtDNA testing involves sequencing at least part of the mitochondria. The mitochondria is inherited from mother to child, and so can reveal information about the direct maternal line. When two individuals have matching or near mitochondria, is can be projected that they share a common maternal-line ancestor at some point in the recent past. 

===Direct paternal lineages===
{{details|Genealogical_DNA_test#Y_chromosome_.28Y-DNA.29_testing{{!}}Genealogical DNA Test - Y-Chromosome DNA (Y-DNA) testing}}
Y-Chromosome DNA (Y-DNA) testing involves [[short tandem repeat]] (STR) and, sometimes, [[single nucleotide polymorphism]] (SNP) testing of the Y-Chromosome. The Y-Chromosome is present only in males and only reveals information on the strict-paternal line. As with the mitochondria, close matches with individuals indicate a recent common ancestor. Because surnames in many cultures are transmitted down the paternal line, this testing is often used by [Surname DNA Project]s. 

===Ancestral origins===
{{Further|Biogeographic ancestry|Population genetics}}
A common component of many autosomal tests is a prediction of biogeographical origin. The company offering the test uses computer algorithms and calculations to make a prediction of what percentage of an individual's DNA comes from particular ancestral groups. A typical number of populations is at least 20. Despite this aspect of the tests being heavily promoted and advertised, many genetic genealogists have warned consumers that the results may be inaccurate, and at best are only approximate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://dna-explained.com/2016/02/10/ethnicity-testing-a-conundrum/ |title=Ethnicity Testing — A Conundrum |website=DNAeXplained – Genetic Genealogy |last=Estes |first=Roberta |date=February 10, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Modern [[DNA sequencing]] has identified various ancestral components in contemporary populations. A number of these genetic elements have [[West Eurasia]]n origins. They include the following ancestral components, with their geographical hubs and main associated populations:

===Human migration===
{{Main|Human migration}}

Genealogical DNA testing methods are in use on a longer time scale to trace [[Human migration|human migratory patterns]]. For example, they determined when the first humans came to [[North America]] and what path they followed.

For several years, researchers and laboratories from around the world sampled indigenous populations from around the globe in an effort to map historical human migration patterns. The National Geographic Society's [[Genographic Project]] aims to map historical human migration patterns by collecting and analyzing DNA samples from over 100,000 people across five continents. The DNA Clans Genetic Ancestry Analysis measures a person's precise genetic connections to indigenous ethnic groups from around the world.&lt;ref name=Genebase /&gt;

[[File:GHS-pictogram-exclam.svg|thumb|The [[GHS hazard pictograms|pictogram]] for harmful substances of the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals.]]

The '''Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals''' ('''GHS''') is an internationally agreed-upon standard managed by the [[United Nations]] that was set up to replace the assortment of hazardous material classification and labelling schemes previously used around the world. Core elements of the GHS include standardized hazard testing criteria, universal warning pictograms, and harmonized safety data sheets which provide users of dangerous goods with a host of information. The system acts as a complement to the [[UN number|UN Numbered]] system of regulated hazmat transport. Implementation is managed through the [[United Nations Secretariat|UN Secretariat]]. Although adoption has taken time, as of 2017, the system has been enacted to significant extents in most major countries of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unece.org/trans/danger/publi/ghs/implementation_e.html|title=GHS implementation -  Transport - UNECE|website=www.unece.org|access-date=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the [[European Union]], which has implemented the United Nations' GHS into EU law as the [[CLP Regulation]], and United States [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] standards.

==History==
Before the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS) was created and implemented, there were many different regulations on hazard classification in use in different countries, resulting in multiple standards, classifications and labels for the same hazard. Given the $1.7 trillion per year international trade in chemicals requiring hazard classification, the cost of compliance with multiple systems of classification and labeling is significant. Developing a worldwide standard accepted as an alternative to local and regional systems presented an opportunity to reduce cost and improve compliance. &lt;ref name="OSHA GHS Guide"&gt;{{cite web |title=A Guide to The Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals |url=https://www.osha.gov/dsg/hazcom/ghsguideoct05.pdf |website=Occupational Safety and Health Administration, United States of America |publisher=OSHA, U.S.A. |accessdate=15 November 2018 |language=English (US) |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GHS development began at the 1992 Rio Conference on Environment and Development by the United Nations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UK Government HSE website|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/chemical-classification/index.htm|author=Health and Safety Executive|publisher=UK Government|date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt; also called [[Earth Summit (1992)]] when the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO), the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), various governments and other stakeholders agreed that "A globally harmonized hazard classification and compatible labelling system, including [[material safety data sheets]] and easily understandable [[symbols]], should be available if feasible, by the year 2000".&lt;ref name=visual&gt;{{Cite web|title = GHS: What's Next? {{!}} Visual.ly|url = http://visual.ly/ghs-whats-next|website = visual.ly|accessdate = 2015-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The universal standard for all countries was to replace all the diverse classification systems; however, it is not a compulsory provision of any treaty. The GHS provides a common infrastructure for participating countries to use when implementing a hazard classification and [[Hazard Communication Standard]].&lt;ref name="OSHA GHS Guide" /&gt;

==Hazard classification==
The GHS classification system is a complex system with data obtained from tests, literature, and practical experience.

The main elements of the hazard classification criteria are summarized below:

===Physical hazards===
Substances or articles are assigned to 9 different [[hazard class]]es largely based on the [[UN Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods|United Nations Dangerous Goods System]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unece.org/trans/danger/publi/unrec/rev19/19files_e.html UN Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods -  Model Regulations, Rev. 19 Volume I] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117032522/http://www.unece.org/trans/danger/publi/unrec/rev19/19files_e.html |date=November 17, 2016 }} 2015, United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, retrieved 6 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|59–60}} Additions and changes have been necessary since the scope of the GHS includes all target audiences.
# '''[[Explosives]]''', which are assigned to one of six subcategories depending on the type of hazard they present, as used in the UN Dangerous Goods System.
# '''Gases''' are category 1 [[flammable]] if they start to flame in a range in air at 20&amp;nbsp;°C and a standard pressure of 101.3 kPa. Category 2 is Non flammable and non toxic gases, and category 3 is toxic gases. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to one of two hazard categories on the basis of the outcome of the test or calculation method.
# A '''[[flammable liquid]]''' is a liquid with a [[flash point]] of not more than 93&amp;nbsp;°C.  Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to one of four hazard categories on the basis of the flash point and [[boiling point]]. A pyrophoric liquid is a liquid that, even in small quantities, is liable to ignite within five minutes after coming into contact with air. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to a single hazard category on the basis of the outcome of the UN Test N.3.
# A '''[[flammable solids|flammable solid]]''' is one that is readily combustible or may cause or contribute to fire through friction.  Readily combustible solids are powdered, granular, or pasty substances which are dangerous if they can be easily ignited by brief contact with an ignition source, such as a burning match, and if the flame spreads rapidly. it is further divided into &lt;br&gt;• flammable solids, &lt;br&gt;• polymerizing substances 
# '''[[self-reactive substance|self-reactive substances]]''', are thermally unstable solids liable to undergo a strongly [[exothermic]] thermal decomposition even without participation of oxygen (air), other than materials classified as explosive, [[organic peroxide]]s or as [[oxidizing]].
# '''[[pyrophoric substance|pyrophoric substance]]''' more coloquially described as spontaneously combusting substances are those solids or liquids that even in small quantities are liable to ignite within five minutes after coming into contact with air. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to a single hazard category on the basis of the outcome of the UN Test N.2. 
# '''[[Self-heating substance|Self-heating substances]]''' A self-heating solids or liquids, other than a [[pyrophoric]] substance, is one which, by reaction with air and without energy supply, are liable to self-heat. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to one of two hazard categories on the basis of the outcome of the UN Test N.4. Substances which on contact with water emit flammable gases are liable to become spontaneously flammable or to give off flammable gases in dangerous quantities. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to one of three hazard categories on the basis of the outcome of UN Test N.5, which measures gas evolution and speed of evolution. Flammable aerosols can be classified as Class 1 or Class 2 if they contain any component, which is classified as flammable.
# '''Oxidizing substances and organic [[peroxide]]s ''' contain &lt;br&gt;• category 1: oxidizing substances and&lt;br&gt;• category 2: organic peroxides, organic liquids or solids that contain the bivalent -O-O- structure and may be considered a derivative of [[hydrogen peroxide]], where one or both of the [[hydrogen]] [[atoms]] have been replaced by [[Substituent|organic radicals]]. The term also includes organic peroxide formulations (mixtures). &lt;br&gt;Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to one of seven 'Types', A to G, on the basis of the outcome of the UN Test Series A to H.
#'''[[Toxic]] and [[infectious]] substances'''
#'''[[Radioactive]] substances''' 
# '''Substances [[corrosive]] to metal''' are substances or mixtures that by chemical action will materially damage or even destroy metals. These substances or mixtures are classified in a single hazard category on the basis of tests (Steel: ISO 9328 (II): 1991 - Steel type P235; Aluminum: ASTM G31-72 (1990) - non-clad types 7075-T6 or AZ5GU-T66). The GHS criteria are a [[corrosion]] rate on [[steel]] or [[aluminum]] surfaces exceeding 6.25&amp;nbsp;mm per year at a test temperature of 55&amp;nbsp;°C.
#'''Miscellaneous''' dangerous substances which includes environmentally dangerous substances

===Health hazards===
* '''[[Acute toxicity]]''' includes five GHS categories from which the appropriate elements relevant to transport, consumer, worker and environment protection can be selected. Substances are assigned to one of the five [[toxicity]] categories on the basis of LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; (oral, dermal) or LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;  (inhalation).
* '''Skin corrosion''' means the production of irreversible damage to the skin following the application of a test substance for up to 4 hours. Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to a single harmonized corrosion category.
* '''[[Skin irritation]]''' means the production of reversible damage to the skin following the application of a test substance for up to 4 hours. Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to a single [[irritation|irritant]] category. For those authorities, such as [[pesticide]] regulators, wanting more than one designation for skin irritation, an additional mild irritant category is provided.
* '''Serious eye damage''' means the production of tissue damage in the eye, or serious physical decay of vision, following application of a test substance to the front surface of the eye, which is not fully reversible within 21 days of application. Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to a single harmonized category.
* '''Eye irritation''' means changes in the eye following the application of a test substance to the front surface of the eye, which are fully reversible within 21 days of application. Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to a single harmonized hazard category.  For authorities, such as pesticide regulators, wanting more than one designation for eye irritation, one of two subcategories can be selected, depending on whether the effects are reversible in 21 or 7 days.
* '''Respiratory sensitizer''' means a substance that induces [[hypersensitivity]] of the airways following inhalation of the substance. Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to one hazard category.
* '''Skin sensitizer''' means a substance that will induce an allergic response following skin contact. The definition for "skin [[wikt:sensitizer|sensitizer]]" is equivalent to "contact sensitizer". Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to one hazard category.
* '''Germ cell mutagenicity''' means an agent giving rise to an increased occurrence of [[mutations]] in populations of cells and/or organisms. Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to one of two hazard categories. Category 1 has two subcategories.
* '''Carcinogenicity''' means a chemical substance or a mixture of chemical substances that induce [[cancer]] or increase its incidence. Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to one of two hazard categories. Category 1 has two subcategories.
* '''[[Reproductive toxicity]]''' includes adverse effects on sexual function and [[fertility]] in adult males and females, as well as [[developmental toxicity]] in offspring.  Substances and mixtures with reproductive and/or developmental effects are assigned to one of two hazard categories, 'known or presumed' and 'suspected'. Category 1 has two subcategories for reproductive and developmental effects. Materials which cause concern for the health of breastfed children have a separate category: effects on or via [[Lactation]].
* '''[[Specific target organ toxicity]] (STOT) ''' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/danger/publi/ghs/ghs_rev02/English/03e_part3.pdf|title=Part 3 Health Hazards| work=Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS)| version=Second revised edition|publisher=United Nations| accessdate=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; category distinguishes between single and repeated exposure for [[Target Organ]] Effects.  All significant health effects, not otherwise specifically included in the GHS, that can impair function, both reversible and irreversible, immediate and/or delayed are included in the non-lethal target organ/systemic toxicity class (TOST). Narcotic effects and respiratory tract irritation are considered to be target organ systemic effects following a single exposure.  Substances and mixtures of the single exposure target organ toxicity hazard class are assigned to one of three hazard categories.  Substances and mixtures of the repeated exposure target organ toxicity hazard class are assigned to one of two hazard categories.
* '''Aspiration hazard''' includes severe acute effects such as [[chemical pneumonia]], varying degrees of [[pulmonary injury]] or death following [[Pulmonary aspiration|aspiration]]. Aspiration is the entry of a liquid or solid directly through the oral or nasal cavity, or indirectly from vomiting, into the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] and [[lower respiratory system]].  Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to one of two hazard categories this hazard class on the basis of [[viscosity]].

===Environmental hazards===

* '''Acute [[aquatic toxicity]]''' means the intrinsic property of a material of causing injury to an [[aquatic organism]] in a short-term exposure. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to one of three toxicity categories on the basis of acute toxicity data: LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; ([[fish]]) or EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; ([[crustacean]]) or ErC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; (for [[algae]] or other [[aquatic plants]]). In some regulatory systems these acute toxicity categories may be subdivided or extended for certain sectors.
* '''Chronic aquatic toxicity''' means the potential or actual properties of a material to cause adverse effects to aquatic organisms during exposures that are determined in relation to the lifecycle of the organism. Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to one of four toxicity categories on the basis of acute data and environmental fate data:  LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; (fish) or EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; (crustacea) or ErC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; (for algae or other aquatic plants) and [[Environmental degradation|degradation]] or [[bioaccumulation]].

===Classification of mixtures===

The GHS approach to the classification of mixtures for health and environmental hazards is also complex.  It uses a tiered approach and is dependent upon the amount of information available for the mixture itself and for its components. Principles that have been developed for the classification of mixtures, drawing on existing systems such as the [[European Union]] (EU) system for classification of preparations laid down in [[Directive 1999/45/EC]].  The process for the classification of mixtures is based on the following steps:

# Where [[toxicological]] or [[ecotoxicological]] test data are available for the mixture itself, the classification of the mixture will be based on that data;
# Where test data are not available for the mixture itself, then the appropriate [[bridging principles]] should be applied, which uses test data for components and/or similar mixtures;
# If (1) test data are not available for the mixture itself, and (2) the bridging principles cannot be applied, then use the calculation or cutoff values described in the specific endpoint to classify the mixture.

==Testing requirements==

The GHS document does not include testing requirements for substances or mixtures.  In fact, one of the main goals of the GHS is to reduce the need for animal testing.  The GHS criteria for determining health and environmental hazards are test method neutral, allowing different approaches as long as they are scientifically sound and validated according to international procedures and criteria already referred to in existing systems.  Test data already generated for the classification of chemicals under existing systems should be accepted when classifying these chemicals under the GHS, thereby avoiding duplicative testing and the unnecessary use of test animals.  The GHS physical hazard criteria are linked to specific [[UN test methods]].  It is assumed that mixtures will be tested for physical hazards.

==Hazard communication==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}
Per GHS, hazards need to be communicated:{{citation needed||date=February 2017}}
* in more than one form (for example, placards, labels or SDS’s).
* with [[GHS hazard statements|hazard statements]] and [[GHS precautionary statements|precautionary statements]].
* in an easily comprehensible and standardized manner.
* consistent with other statements to reduce confusion.
* taking into account all existing research and any new evidence.

Comprehensibility is challenging for a single culture and language, so global harmonization is complex. The [[GHS Purple Book]] includes a comprehensibility-testing instrument in Annex 6. Factors that were considered in developing the GHS communication tools include:{{citation needed||date=February 2017}}
* Different philosophies in existing systems on how and what should be communicated;
* Language differences around the world;
* Ability to translate phrases meaningfully;
* Ability to understand and appropriately respond to [[pictograms]].

===GHS label elements===
[[File:GHS-pictogram-silhouette.svg|thumb|The symbol for substances hazardous to the human health as implemented by the GHS.]]

The standardized label elements included in the GHS are:
* '''Symbols''' ([[GHS hazard pictograms]]): Convey [[health]], physical and [[Natural environment|environmental]] hazard information, assigned to a GHS hazard class and category.  Pictograms include the harmonized hazard symbols plus other graphic elements, such as borders, background patterns or cozers and substances which have target organ toxicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = GHS pictograms -  Transport - UNECE|url = http://www.unece.org/trans/danger/publi/ghs/pictograms.html|website = www.unece.org|accessdate = 2015-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, harmful chemicals and irritants are marked with an [[exclamation mark]], replacing the European [[saltire]]. Pictograms will have a black symbol on a white background with a red diamond frame.  For transport, pictograms will have the background, symbol and colors currently used in the ''[[UN Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods]]''. Where a [[transport pictogram]] appears, the GHS pictogram for the same hazard should not appear.
* '''Signal words''':  "Danger" or "Warning" will be used to emphasize hazards and indicate the relative level of severity of the hazard, assigned to a GHS hazard class and category.  Some lower level hazard categories do not use signal words. Only one signal word corresponding to the class of the most severe hazard should be used on a label.
* '''[[GHS hazard statement]]''': Standard phrases assigned to a [[hazard class]] and category that describe the nature of the hazard.  An appropriate statement for each GHS hazard should be included on the label for products possessing more than one hazard.

The additional label elements included in the GHS are:
* '''[[GHS precautionary statements]]''': Measures to minimize or prevent [[adverse effects]].  There are four types of precautionary statements covering: prevention, [[Chemical accidents|response in cases of accidental spillage or exposure]], storage, and disposal. The precautionary statements have been linked to each GHS hazard statement and type of hazard.
* '''[[Product identifier]]''' (ingredient disclosure): Name or number used for a hazardous product on a label or in the SDS.  The GHS label for a substance should include the [[chemical identity]] of the substance.  For mixtures, the label should include the chemical identities of all ingredients that contribute to acute toxicity, skin corrosion or serious eye damage, germ cell mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, reproductive toxicity, skin or respiratory sensitization, or Systemic Target Organ Systemic (STOT), when these hazards appear on the label.
* '''Supplier identification''': The name, address and telephone number should be provided on the label.
* '''Supplemental information''': Non-harmonized information on the container of a hazardous product that is not required or specified under the GHS.  Supplemental information may be used to provide further detail that does not contradict or cast doubt on the validity of the standardized hazard information.

===GHS label format===

The GHS includes directions for application of the hazard communication elements on the label. In particular, it specifies for each hazard, and for each class within the hazard, what signal word, [[pictogram]], and hazard statement should be used. The GHS hazard pictograms, signal words and hazard statements should be located together on the label. The actual label format or layout is not specified in the GHS. National authorities may choose to specify where information should appear on the label or allow supplier discretion.  There has been discussion about the size of GHS pictograms and that a GHS pictogram might be confused with a transport pictogram or "diamond". Transport pictograms are different in appearance than the GHS pictograms. Annex 7 of the Purple Book explains how the GHS pictograms are expected to be proportional to the size of the label text so that generally the GHS pictograms would be smaller than the transport pictograms.{{citation needed||date=February 2017}}

===Safety data sheet===

The [[safety data sheet]] or SDS (The GHS dropped the word "material" from material safety data sheet in its final revisions) is specifically aimed at use in the workplace. It should provide comprehensive information about the chemical product that allows employers and workers to obtain concise, relevant and accurate information in perspective to the hazards, uses and [[risk management]] of the chemical product in the workplace. While there were some differences in existing industry recommendations and country specific requirements, there was agreement on a 16 section SDS to include the following headings in the order specified:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://onlineehssupply.com/2017/02/25/understanding-ghs-sds-sections/|title=Understanding The GHS SDS Sections}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Identification
# Hazard(s) identification
# Composition/ information on ingredients
# [[First-aid]] measures
# Fire-fighting measures
# [[Chemical accidents|Accidental release measures]]
# Handling and storage
# Exposure control/ personal protection
# Physical and chemical properties
# [[chemical stability]] and [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]]
# Toxicological information
# Ecological information
# Disposal considerations
# Transport information
# Regulatory information
# Other information

The primary difference between the GHS and the international industry recommendations is that sections 2 and 3 have been reversed in order.  The GHS SDS headings, sequence and content are similar to the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]], [[European Union]] and [[ANSI]] MSDS/SDS requirements.  The SDS should provide a clear description of the data used to identify the hazards.  A table comparing the content and format of a MSDS/SDS versus the GHS SDS is provided in Appendix A of the U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) GHS guidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals - GHS|url = https://www.osha.gov/dsg/hazcom/ghs.html#3.0|website = www.osha.gov|accessdate = 2015-06-18|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070702005153/http://www.osha.gov/dsg/hazcom/ghs.html#3.0|archivedate = 2007-07-02|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training==

Current training procedures for [[Hazard Communication]] in the United States are more detailed than the GHS training recommendations.&lt;ref name="OSHA GHS Guide" /&gt; Educating employees on the updated chemical and product classifications and related pictograms, signal words, hazard statements and precautionary measures at the level of detail by the national authority represents the greatest training challenge.  Training will be a key component of the overall GHS approach and should incorporate information as it is introduced into the workplace.  Employees and [[emergency responders]] will need to be trained on all new program elements, from hazard statements to pictograms. Bear in mind, if the importation of products using only GHS labeling is permitted prior to its adoption in the United States and Canada, employers may need to begin employee training may need to begin earlier than expected.

==Implementation==

The [[United Nations]] goal was broad international adoption, and as of 2017, GHS has been adopted to varying degrees in nearly all major countries.

== Example ==

[[File:HypotheticalInterologExample.png|thumb|right|220px|alt=A]]

Suppose that A and B are two different interacting human proteins, and A' and B' are two different interacting dog proteins.  Then the interaction between A and B is an interolog of the interaction between A' and B' if the following conditions all hold:
*A is a homolog of A'. (Protein homologs have similar [[amino acid]] sequences and derive from a common ancestral sequence).
*B is a homolog of B'.
*A and B interact.
*A' and B' interact.

Thus, interologs are homologous pairs of protein interactions across different organisms.

'''Johann Ernst Elias Bessler''' (''ca''. 1680 – November 30, 1745), known as '''Orffyreus''' or '''Orffyré''', was a German entrepreneur who claimed to have built several [[perpetual motion]] machines.  Those claims generated considerable interest and controversy among some of the leading [[Natural philosophy|natural philosophers]] of the day, including [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], [[Johann Bernoulli]], [[John Theophilus Desaguliers]], and [[Willem 's Gravesande]].  The modern scientific consensus is that Bessler perpetrated a deliberate fraud, although the details of this have not been satisfactorily explained.

==Life and career==
Bessler was born to a peasant family in [[Lusatia|Upper Lusatia]], [[Germany]], ''circa'' 1680.&lt;ref&gt;A contemporary source says that he was born in "Ullersdorff near Zittau" (today Oldrichov, Czech Republic) : "Bibliothèque Germanique ou Histoire littéraire de l'Allemagne, de la Suisse et des Pays du Nord", XXXIX, 1737, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; He completed secondary schooling in [[Zittau]] and then travelled widely.  An [[Alchemy|alchemist]] instructed him on the fabrication of elixirs and he found work as a healer.  He was also an apprentice watchmaker until his fortunes improved when he married a wealthy woman in [[Annaberg-Buchholz|Annaberg]].&lt;ref name="Jenkins"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jenkins | first1 = Alejandro | title = The mechanical career of Councillor Orffyreus, confidence man | doi = 10.1119/1.4798617 | journal = American Journal of Physics | volume = 81 | issue = 6 | pages = 421–427 | year = 2013 | pmid =| arxiv = 1301.3097| bibcode = 2013AmJPh..81..421J| pmc = |author-link = Alejandro Jenkins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bessler adopted the pseudonym "Orffyreus" by writing the letters of the alphabet in a circle and selecting the letters diametrically opposite to those of his surname (what would modernly be called a [[ROT13]] cipher), thus obtaining ''Orffyre'', which he then [[Latin]]ized into ''Orffyreus''.&lt;ref name="Gould"&gt;[[Rupert Gould|Rupert T. Gould]], "Orffyreus's Wheel," in ''Oddities: A Book of Unexplained Facts'', revised ed., (London: Geoffrey Bles, 1944), pp. 89-116.  Reprinted by Kessinger Pub Co., 2003, {{ISBN|978-0-7661-3620-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  That was the name by which he was generally known thereafter.

===Orffyreus's wheels===
In 1712, Bessler appeared in the town of [[Gera]] in the [[province of Reuss]] and exhibited a "self-moving wheel," which was about 6½&amp;nbsp;ft (2&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter and {{convert|4|in|cm}} thick. Once in motion it was capable of lifting several pounds.&lt;ref name="Gould" /&gt;  Bessler then moved to Draschwitz, a village near [[Leipzig]], where in 1713 he constructed an even larger wheel, a little over nine feet (2¾&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter and six inches (15&amp;nbsp;cm) in width. That wheel could turn at fifty revolutions a minute and raise a weight of forty pounds (18&amp;nbsp;kg).&lt;ref name="Gould" /&gt;

The eminent mathematician [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] visited Draschwitz in 1714 and witnessed a demonstration of Bessler's wheel.  In a letter to Robert Erskine, physician and advisor to Russian Tsar [[Peter the Great]], Leibniz later wrote that Bessler was "one of my friends" and that he believed Bessler's wheel to be a valuable invention.  Bessler also received support from other members of Leibniz's intellectual circle, including mathematician [[Johann Bernoulli]], philosopher [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]], and architect [[Joseph Emanuel Fischer von Erlach]].&lt;ref name="Jenkins" /&gt;

[[File:BesslerOrffyreusWheel.png|thumb|269px|Orffyreus Wheel diagram. ([[Merseburg, Germany]])]]
[[File:OrffyreusWheel.png|thumb|269px|Orffyreus Wheel diagram. ([[Kassel, Germany]])]]

Bessler then constructed a still larger wheel in [[Merseburg]], before moving to the independent state of [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]], where [[Charles I, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel|Prince Karl]], the reigning [[Landgrave]] and an enthusiastic patron of mechanical inventors, appointed him as a commercial councillor (''Kommerzialrat'') for the town of [[Kassel]] and provided him with rooms in Weissenstein Castle.&lt;ref name="Schaffer"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Schaffer |first = Simon |title=The show that never ends: perpetual motion in the early eighteenth century |journal=British Journal for the History of Science |volume=28 |issue=2 |year=1995 |pages=157–189 |jstor=4027676 |doi=10.1017/s0007087400032957 | author-link = Simon Schaffer}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was there that in 1717 he constructed his largest wheel so far, {{convert|12|ft|m}} in diameter and {{convert|14|in|cm}} thick.&lt;ref name="Gould" /&gt;

The inventor demonstrated the operation of his wheel before various audiences, always taking care that the mechanism within the wheel should remain hidden from view, purportedly to prevent others from stealing his invention.  The wheel was examined externally by several scientists, including [[Willem 's Gravesande]], professor of mathematics and astronomy at [[Leiden University]], who reported that he could not detect any fraud regarding its operation.  On November&amp;nbsp;12, 1717, the wheel was locked in a room in the castle with the doors and windows sealed to prevent any interference. This was witnessed by the Landgrave and various officials. Two weeks later, the seals were broken and the room was opened, whereupon the wheel was found to be revolving. The door was resealed until January&amp;nbsp;4, 1718.  The wheel was then found to be turning at twenty-six revolutions per minute.&lt;ref name="Gould" /&gt;

Bessler demanded [[Pound sterling|£]]20,000 (equivalent to 100,000 [[Reichsthaler]]s) in exchange for revealing the secret of his machines.  Peter the Great was interested in purchasing the invention and sought advice on the matter from Gravesande and others. Gravesande examined the axle of the wheel, concluding that he could see no way in which power could be transmitted to it from the outside. Bessler, however, then smashed the wheel, accusing 's Gravesande of trying to discover the secret of the wheel without paying for it, and declaring that the curiosity of the professor had provoked him.&lt;ref name="Gould" /&gt;

=== Later life ===
Bessler and his machine then vanished into obscurity. It is known that he was rebuilding his machine in 1727 and that 's Gravesande had agreed to examine it again, but it is not known whether it was ever tested. Bessler was apparently arrested in 1733, but by 1738 he was again free and living in an estate in [[Bad Karlshafen]], near Kassel.&lt;ref name="Jenkins" /&gt;  Bessler died in 1745, aged sixty-five, when he fell to his death from a four-and-a-half-story windmill he was constructing in [[Fürstenberg, Lower Saxony|Fürstenburg]].&lt;ref name="Gould" /&gt;

==Mechanism of Orffyreus's Wheel==
Bessler's devices were all hollow wheels, with canvas covering the internal mechanism, that turned on a horizontal axis supported by vertical wooden beams on either side of the wheel.&lt;ref name="Gould" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Schaffer" /&gt;  Christian Wolff, who viewed the wheel in 1715, wrote that Bessler freely revealed that the device utilized weights of about 4 pounds.  Fischer von Erlach, who viewed the wheel in 1721, reported: "At every turn of the wheel can be heard the sound of about eight weights, which fall gently on the side toward which the wheel turns."&lt;ref&gt;Letter from J. E. Fischer to [[John Theophilus Desaguliers]], 1721.  Quoted by R.T. Gould, ''Oddities'', p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;  In a letter to Sir [[Isaac Newton]], 's&amp;nbsp;Gravesande reported that, when pushed, the wheel took two or three revolutions to reach a maximum speed of about 25 revolutions per minute.&lt;ref&gt;Letter by W. 's Gravesande to I. Newton, August 1721, quoted by R.T. Gould, ''Oddities'', p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;  The wheels at Merseburg and Kassel were attached to three-bobbed [[pendulum|pendula]], one on either side, which presumably acted as regulators, limiting the maximum speed of revolution.&lt;ref name="Gould" /&gt;

Bessler never revealed the mechanism that kept his wheel in motion and, according to surviving sources, the Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel was the only person whom he ever allowed to examine the inside of the wheel.&lt;ref name="Gould" /&gt; In 1719 Bessler published a pamphlet in German and Latin, entitled ''The Triumphant Orffyrean Perpetual Motion'', which gives a very vague account of his principles.&lt;ref&gt;J. E. E. Bessler ("Orffyreus"), ''[http://digbijzcoll.library.uu.nl/lees_gfx.php?W=On&amp;BoekID=016185 Das Triumphirende Perpetuum mobile Orffyreanum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004064722/http://digbijzcoll.library.uu.nl/lees_gfx.php?W=On&amp;BoekID=016185 |date=2011-10-04 }}'', (Kassel, 1719).&lt;/ref&gt; He indicated that the wheel depended upon weights placed so that they can "never attain equilibrium."  This suggests that it was a kind of "overbalanced wheel,"&lt;ref name="Gould" /&gt; a hypothetical gravity-powered device which is now recognized by physicists as impossible (see [[perpetual motion]]).

===Allegations of fraud===
Most of the people who met him, including supporters such as 's Gravesande, reported that Bessler was eccentric, ill-tempered, and perhaps even insane.&lt;ref name="Gould" /&gt;  From the beginning, Bessler's work generated accusations of fraud from various people, including mining engineer Johann Gottfried Borlach, mathematician Christian Wagner, model-maker Andreas Gärtner, Kassel court tutor [[Jean-Pierre de Crousaz]], and others.  Gärtner went on to gain employ as model-master for the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish royal court]], and in that capacity he built several devices that reproduced some of the successes of Bessler's public demonstrations, including the locked-room test, but which Gärtner acknowledged as mere trickery.&lt;ref name="Schaffer" /&gt;

In November 1727, Bessler's maid, Anne Rosine Mauersbergerin, ran away from Bessler's household and testified under oath that she had turned the machines manually from an adjoining room, alternating in that job with Bessler's wife, his brother Gottfried, and Bessler himself.  's Gravesande refused to accept the maid's testimony, writing that he paid "little attention to what a servant can say about machines".  By then, 's Gravesande was embroiled in an academic dispute with members of Isaac Newton's circle about the possibility of gravity-powered perpetual motion, which 's Gravesande persistently defended based partly on his belief that Bessler, though "mad", was not a fraud.&lt;ref name="Jenkins" /&gt;

The consensus view of modern scientists is that Bessler was perpetrating a deliberate fraud, though just how his wheel was powered is not entirely clear.&lt;ref name="Jenkins" /&gt;  According to the writers of ''[[Chambers's Encyclopaedia]]'', Orffyreus's wheel, "but for its strange effect on 's Gravesande, would have been forgotten long ago".&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=lmgMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA413 Perpetual Motion]", ''Chambers's encyclopædia: a dictionary of universal knowledge'', vol. 7, (London: W. and R. Chambers, 1868), pp. 412-415.&lt;/ref&gt;  If the maid's confession were true, the testimonies by Prince Karl, 's Gravesande, and others about the conditions under which the wheel was tested and exhibited must be flawed.&lt;ref name="Gould" /&gt;

'''John Cuthbertson''' (bapt. 1 July 1743 in [[Dearham]] – 1821)&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/37336 |title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2012-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an English instrument maker and inventor that lived from 1768 until roughly 1796 in [[Amsterdam]].

==Biography==
John was the second son of the inn keeper and [[yeoman]] Jonathan Cuthbertson and his second wife  Mary Fisher. John had three siblings, of which two survived (a younger brother Jonathan (1744–1806) and one other): the third died at young age (Jonathan, the eldest). John and the younger brother Jonathan are often confused in literature and publications. While John worked for a long time in Amsterdam, Jonathan worked n Rotterdam, both in the same line of work.&lt;ref name="Oxford" /&gt;

John studied with the prominent London instrument maker [[James Champneys]] and when Champney moved to Amsterdam&lt;ref&gt;according to some sources after a bankruptcy: other sources deny this (Bryden 1977)&lt;/ref&gt; in December 1768 Cuthbertson joined him. On 1 September 1768 John  had married Champney's daughter Jane. They had four children, three sons and a daughter, but only the daughter, Jane Cuthberson, survived.&lt;ref name="Oxford" /&gt;

In 1782 Cuthbertson published a book in Dutch called ''Algemeene Eigenschappen van Electriciteit, onderrichting van de Werktuigen en het nemen van proeven in dezelve'' (free translation: "General characteristics of electricity, education on the tools and the performing of tests in those") and also organized public lectures, both to disseminate the knowledge about electricity, in his opinion very poor in the Netherlands. The book was quite popular in the Netherlands, and lead him to publish another two volumes with even more possible experiments.&lt;ref name="Hackmann"&gt;{{Cite book |author=W. D. Hackmann |title=The Design of the Triboelectric Generators of Martinus van Marum, F.R.S. A Case History of the Interaction between England and Holland in the Field of Instrument Design in the Eighteenth Century |pages=163–169 |jstor=531161 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all his publications Cuthbertson seems to concentrate on the glass plate generators and not on the cylindrical ones, possibly because he was involved in the production of the glass plate generators.

In 1783–1784 he used the suggestions of [[Martinus van Marum]], who also had a history of designing electrostatic generators and who had already been in touch with Cuthbertson, in 1774 and 1781, to build the (at that time) largest glass plate electrostatic generator in existence for the [[Teylers Tweede Genootschap]] of the [[Teylers Stichting]]. It had  disks with a diameter of {{convert|1.65|m|abbr=on}} and was connected to a battery of [[Leyden jar]]s to store the  charge produced. With this machine a 61&amp;nbsp;cm (2&amp;nbsp;ft) spark could be produced of, which comes down to roughly 330.000 [[Volt]]. Van Marum believed that with larger machines, currents and charges more  scientific progress could be made. The machine was based on a smaller model produced by Jonathan Cuthbertson shortly before, but with some significant changes, such as  glass poles instead of wooden ones. Based on empirical studies Cuthbertson made changes to the scaled-up model. Finally the machine was installed in December 1784 and he received the sum of 3000 guilders for it.&lt;ref name="Hackmann" /&gt;

Sometime between 1793 and 1796 he returned to England, living in Poland Street in London (contrary to his brother Jonathan who remained in Rotterdam), probably due to the political unrest in the Dutch Republic. Here he continued his business and produced a number of smaller (simplified) electrostatic generators – a design that would be produced until the 1920s.&lt;ref name="BJHS"&gt;D. J. Bryden, ''The British Journal for the History of Science'' (1977), 10 : pp 77-77 [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=2916712&amp;jid=BJH&amp;volumeId=10&amp;issueId=01&amp;aid=2916708]&lt;/ref&gt; He also worked on [[electrometer]]s, for which he invented a new design, air pumps and wrote scientific papers. For ''[[Rees's Cyclopædia]]'' he  contributed articles about electricity, but the topics are not known. He died in 1821 and was buried in [[St James's Church, Piccadilly]].&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt;

The '''Jovian Europa Orbiter''' ('''JEO''') was a feasibility study by the [[European Space Agency]] for a mission to [[Jupiter|Jupiter's]] moon [[Europa (moon)|Europa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=35982 ESA Science &amp; Technology: Jovian Minisat Explorer]&lt;/ref&gt; JEO would be capable of collecting information about Europa by orbiting it, and would have worked together with the ''Jovian Relay Spacecraft'' (JRS) and the ''Jovian Minisat Explorer'' (JME).

The ''Jovian Europa Orbiter'' was part of ESA's "Technology Reference Studies", which was superseded in 2007 by ESA's "Cosmic Vision",&lt;ref&gt;[http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=33170 TRS: Technology Reference Studies]&lt;/ref&gt; which includes the [[Europa Jupiter System Mission]]. EJSM was halted in 2011 due to funding issues at that time, which included several spacecraft, and ESA component of that stage was rebooted as [[Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer]] planned for the 2020s

The relay would allow keeping spaceflight hardware out of the intense radiation zones near Europa, but they would be launched and transit to Jupiter together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sci.esa.int/trs/35982-jovian-minisat-explorer/|title=Jovian Minisat Explorer|website=sci.esa.int|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12336">[[File:Map of USA NY.svg|thumb|The location of the [[state of New York]] in the [[United States of America]]]]
This is a '''list of symbols of the [[state of New York]]''' in the [[United States]]. The majority of the state symbols are officially listed in the [[New York Consolidated Laws]] in Article 6, Sections 70 through 87.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/reference/emblems.htm|title=New York State Information|date=2004-08-18|accessdate=2008-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The symbols are recognized by these laws and were signed into law by the governor of New York.

The oldest symbols, the state flag and the state arms, were adopted in 1778, and the most recent additions to the list, the snapping turtle and lilac bush, were added in 2006. The origin of the state motto dates back to 1784. During a tour of the state's harbors, waterways, and fertile interior, [[George Washington]] referred to New York as the "Seat of Empire". The term "The Big Apple" was coined by jazz musicians of the 1930s who used the slang expression "apple" when referring to any city.  

The state insect took nine years to become official. In 1980, fifth grader Kristina Savoca sent a letter - along with a petition bearing 152 signatures - to New York State Assemblyman [[Robert C. Wertz]], urging him to introduce legislation designating the lady beetle as the official state insect. The proposal languished for a number of years, passing in the Assembly but not being considered in the Senate. Approval finally came in 1989, after Cornell University entomologists suggested that Wertz propose the nine-spotted lady beetle (''Coccinella novemnotata'', sometimes abbreviated to C-9) as the state insect because it was a native lady beetle.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4128">There are a number of '''commercial products based on [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]]''' (RHEL). Information about these products and the version of RHEL they are based on is often difficult to come by, since this fact is not widely publicised. Sometimes it is possible to run the 'uname -r' command to get the kernel release and then cross-reference it with the RHEL version history.

[[Image:Island nations.svg|thumb|350px|Sovereign states and states with limited recognition fully on islands (Australia is regarded a continent), those with land borders shaded green, and those without shaded dark blue]]

This is a '''list of island countries'''. An [[island]] is a land mass (smaller than a [[continent]]) that is surrounded by water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/island| title=Definition of island| publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[island country|island countries]] are spread over an [[archipelago]], as is the case with the [[Federated States of Micronesia]] and the [[Indonesia]] (both of which consist of thousands of islands). Others consist of a single island, such as [[Nauru]], or part of an island, such as [[Haiti]]. Although [[Australia]] is designated as [[Australia (continent)|a continent]], it is often referred to as an island, as it  has no land [[border]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Löffler |first=Ernst |authorlink= |author2=A.J. Rose, Anneliese Löffler &amp; Denis Warner |title=Australia:Portrait of a Continent |year=1983 |publisher=Hutchinson Group |location=[[Richmond, Victoria]] |page=17 |isbn=0-09-130460-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some declared island countries are not universally recognized as politically independent, such as [[Northern Cyprus]]. Some states, such as [[Taiwan]], officially claim to hold continental territories but are ''de facto'' limited to control over islands.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8802">'''Marketing engineering''' is currently definded as "a systematic approach to harness data and knowledge to drive effective marketing decision making an implementation through a technology-enabled and model-supported decision process".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/840607615|title=Principles of marketing engineering|last=Arvind.|first=Rangaswamy,|last2=de.|first2=Bruyn, Arnaud|date=2013|publisher=DecisionPro|isbn=0985764805|oclc=840607615}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term ''marketing engineering'' can be traced back to Lilien et al. in "The Age of Marketing Engineering" published in 1998;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.ama.org/Archive/ResourceLibrary/MarketingManagement/Pages/1998/7/1/679274.aspx|title=The Age of Marketing Engineering.|website=archive.ama.org|language=en-us|access-date=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; in this article the authors define ''marketing engineering'' as the use of [[computer]] [[decision model]]s for making [[marketing]] decisions. [[Marketing manager]]s typically use "conceptual marketing", that is they develop a [[mental model]] of the decision situation based on past experience, intuition and reasoning. That approach has its limitations though: experience is unique to every individual, there is no objective way of choosing between the best judgments of multiple individuals in such a situation and furthermore judgment can be influenced by the person position in the [[Hierarchical organization|firm's hierarchy]]. In same year [[Gary Lilien|Lilien G. L.]] and A. Rangaswamy published ''Marketing Engineering: Computer-Assisted Marketing Analysis and Planning'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/731888669|title=Marketing Engineering : computer assisted marketing analysis and planning|last=Arvind.|first=Rangaswamy,|date=2005|publisher=Trafford|isbn=1412022525|oclc=731888669}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Fildes and Ventura''&lt;ref&gt;The Journal of Operational Research Society, Vol. 51, No. 7 (Jul., 2000), pp. 891–892&lt;/ref&gt; praised the book in their review, while noting that a fuller discussion of [[market share]] models and [[econometric model]]s would have made the book better for teaching and that "conceptual marketing" should not be discarded in the presence of marketing engineering, but that both approaches should be used together. Leeflang and Wittink (2000)&lt;ref&gt;P.S.H. Leeflang, D. R. Wittink, Building models for marketing decisions: Past, present and future, International Journal of Research in Marketing, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; have identified five era of model building in marketing:
# (1950-1965) The first era of application of [[operations research]] and [[management science]] to marketing
# (1965-1970) Adaptation of models to fit marketing problems
# (1970-1985) Emphasis on models that are an acceptable representation of reality and are easy to use
# (1985-2000) Increase interest in marketing [[decision support system]]s, [[meta-analyses]] and studies of the generalizability of results
# (2000- .  ) Growth of new exchange systems (ex: [[e-commerce]]) and need for new modeling approaches

How to build market models and how to develop a structured approach to marketing questions has been an issue of active discussion between researchers, L. Lilien and A. Rangaswamy (2001)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lilien|first=Gary L.|last2=Rangaswamy|first2=Arvind|date=2001-06-01|title=The Marketing Engineering Imperative: Introduction to the Special Issue|url=http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/inte.31.3s.1.9679|journal=Interfaces|volume=31|issue=3_supplement|pages=S1–S7|doi=10.1287/inte.31.3s.1.9679|issn=0092-2102}}&lt;/ref&gt; have observed that while having data gives a competitive advantage, having too much data without the models and systems for working with it may turn out to be as bad as not having the data. Lodish (2001) &lt;ref&gt;Leonard M. Lodish, (2001) Building Marketing Models that Make Money. Interfaces 31(3_supplement):S45-S5&lt;/ref&gt; observed that the most complicated and [[mathematical beauty|elegant model]] will not necessarily be the one adopted in the firm, good models are the ones who capture the [[trade-off]]s of [[decision making]], subjective [[estimate]]s may be necessary to complete the model, risk needs to be taken into account, model complexity must be balanced versus ease of understanding, models should integrate tactical with strategic aspects. Migley (2002)&lt;ref&gt;David Migley, What to codify: marketing science or marketing engineering? Marketing theory 2002&lt;/ref&gt; identifies four purposes in codifying marketing knowledge:
# To facilitate the progress of marketing as a [[science]]
# To promote the discipline within its institutional and professional environments
# To better educate and credential the potential manager
# To provide competitive advantage to the firm
Lilien et al.(2002)&lt;ref&gt;Lilien L.G., Rangaswamy A., van Bruggen Gerrit H.,Wierenga B., Bridging the marketing theory-practice gap with marketing engineering, Journal of Business Research 2002&lt;/ref&gt; define marketing engineering as "the systematic process of putting marketing data and knowledge to practical use through the planning, design, and construction of decision aids and marketing management support systems (MMSSs)". One the driving factors toward the development of marketing engineering are the use of high-powered personal computers connected to [[LAN]]s and [[Wide area network|WAN]]s, the [[Big data|exponential growth in the volume of data]], the reengineering of marketing functions. The effectiveness of the implementation of marketing engineering and MMSSs in the firm depend on the decision situation characteristics(demand), the nature of the MMSS (supply), match between supply and demand, design characteristics of the MMSS, characteristics of implementation process.  Wider adoption depend on difference between end-user systems and high-end systems, user training and the growth of the [[Internet]].

'''No innovation without representation''' is a democratic ideal of ensuring that everyone involved gets a chance to be represented fairly in technological developments. Political philosopher of technology [[Langdon Winner]] states that groups and social interests likely to be affected by a particular kind of technological change ought to be represented at an early stage in defining exactly what that technology will be. It is the idea that relevant parties have a say in technological developments and are not left in the dark.&lt;ref&gt;Winner, Langdon. "Artifact/Ideas and Political Culture." Technology and the Future (1993): 283-92. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been spoken about by political scientist [[Massimiano Bucchi]].&lt;ref&gt;Bucchi, Massimiano. "No Innovation without Representation (A Parliament of Things for the New Technical Democracies)." http://www.fondazionebassetti.org/. 20 Dec. 2003. Web. 21 Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; This ideal does not require the public to become experts on the topics of science and engineering, it only asks that the opinions and ideas be heard before making drastic decisions, as talked about by [[Steven L. Goldman]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Steven L. "No Innovation Without Representation: Technological Action in a Democratic Society." New Worlds, New Technologies, New Issues (1992): 148-60. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments for no innovation without representation==
Arguments for ''no innovation without representation'' stated by [[Carl Mitcham]]:&lt;ref&gt;Mitcham, Carl. "Justifying Public Participation in Technical Decision Making." ''IEEE Technology and Society Magazine'' 1 January 1997: 40–46. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Experts cannot escape public influence. There will always be influence from corporations or outside sources. "Technoscientific decision making is never neutral or objective."&lt;ref&gt;ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Public participation will have a more beneficial long-term effect than no participation. "Without public participation nothing will get done"&lt;ref&gt;ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Experts promote their own self-interest at the expense of the public. Justification of modern technology is that it is designed to promote human welfare.
# Those that are affected by technological decisions should have a say in what affects them.
# Moral autonomy is necessary. This is when "persons find their moral agency abridged when decisions that affect their lives are made heteronomously by others."&lt;ref&gt;ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Public participation will lead to better outcomes. The idea that the majority will make the decision that has the most positive impact on technology or themselves.
# Education through participation is necessary. Individuals will only become more intelligent through participation.
# Currently there is a lack of strong moral consensus. People have different feelings and different opinions and participation of a greater population will have the greatest positive effect on society.

==Examples of when no innovation without representation was unnecessary==

Not all technology needs equal structural influence. Giving weight to the fact that one should not have to defend every decision they make to a large committee or formalized group. “Every time someone is moved to buy a fork or to sell a pencil sharpener”&lt;ref&gt;Sclove, Richard E. "Strong Democracy and Technology." Democracy and Technology (1995): 26-41. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  it would be a distraction from important technological advances as well as a misuse of resources to poll everyone involved. Technology that is already developed without controversy is part of our social principle and not something democratically necessary to go about evaluation for use in general life. The primary consideration of democratic innovation is for those instances that affect a large level and hold influences beyond ethnic value.&lt;ref&gt;ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

“Rule by democratic elites is more democratic than thick democratic participation – in the sense that it is more likely, at least in theory, to protect civil liberties and minority rights.”.&lt;ref&gt;Mitcham, Carl. "Justifying Public Participation in Technical Decision Making." IEEE Technology and Society Magazine 1 Jan. 1997: 40-46. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  A great example is that the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], arguably one of the most important documents in American history, was developed by a group of experts who were looking out for the common goal of the majority population. A participatory democracy involving the consideration and opinions of everyone involved, at the time could have taken years to implement, as well as would have been more suited towards white, rich, land owners rather than the majority population.&lt;ref&gt;ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of when it was not implemented==

“The very existence of a commercial nuclear power industry is itself a consequence, neither of the nuclear science and engineering knowledge bases available in the 1950s, nor of a perceived need on the part of U.S. utilities for alternatives to coal, oil, and natural gas, but of deliberate federal policy decisions.”&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Steven L. "No Innovation Without Representation: Technological Action in a Democratic Society." New Worlds, New Technologies, New Issues (1992): 148-60. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Action was taken by the Truman and Eisenhower administrations, the Atomic Energy Commission, and the Congressional Joint Committee on Atomic Energy to commercialize nuclear technologies. This decision was made without consulting a greater scale of opinions specifically nuclear engineers related to outside sources. The currently functioning commercial nuclear power plants in the United States are light water reactors, which set the standard for size of power plants, and were the direct result of government funded facilities such as General Electric and Westinghouse. The current thirty-five year old commitment and billions of dollars of federal funds into nuclear and fusion research continues to grow as nuclear waste and more sustainable and egalitarian programs go unfunded.&lt;ref&gt;ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of when it was implemented==

In 1970 Northwest Canada was found to have an abundance of natural gas. Rather than allowing pipelines to be built with no regard to the Indian tribes living there, a Canadian Supreme Court justice, Thomas Burger, arranged community hearings. These hearings took place to allow both investors of the pipeline as well as the Indians who would be directly affected by its construction to come forward with their concerns and evidence for their reasoning’s. The judge believed that everyone’s point should be respectfully considered, and to further prove this he arranged over 30 meetings in remote settings and provided transportation in those interested in attending. In addition, media radio coverage was provided in French, English, and Native languages, which allowed people to understand multiple sides of concerns and the process that was taking place. Ultimately it was decided to reroute the pipeline to follow existing highways rather than cutting through Native lands.&lt;ref&gt;Sclove, Richard E. "Strong Democracy and Technology." Democracy and Technology (1995): 26-41. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future changes==

According to Richard Sclove, there are two main reasons for why the democratic system will be most effective when cultural pluralism is seen as an important factor in community success. "First, equal respect for people entails respecting their cultural heritage. To undermine a culture corrodes the social bases of its members’ sense of self and purpose. Second, all people share an interest in living in a society and a world {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} many cultures.”&lt;ref&gt;ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

==These ideals further divide into the ideas that follow==

* Decentralization of government systems brings stronger small scale power which allow for decision to be made by those whom it directly applies. This is “because of distinctive and unescapable physical and moral interdependencies.”&lt;ref&gt;ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Community differences give people the opportunity to experience life with more variety at a more frequent manor. Giving opportunity for cultural sabbaticals allows for embrace these variations.
* Accepting variations fosters more social thinkers allowing them to reach a wider range of people and systems thus balancing respect among the community thus balancing the protection of all cultures.

Innovation with representation will truly be reached when respect for all becomes the first component to uphold in decision making.&lt;ref&gt;ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; Following these ideals open doors of perception of which cast potential on more controlled innovation through those of which it ultimately fosters.

'''Political geography''' is concerned with the study of both the spatially uneven outcomes of [[politics|political]] processes and the ways in which political processes are themselves affected by spatial structures. Conventionally, for the purposes of analysis, political geography adopts a three-scale structure with the study of [[State (polity)|the state]] at the centre, the study of [[international relations]] (or [[geopolitics]]) above it, and the study of localities below it. The primary concerns of the subdiscipline can be summarized as the inter-relationships between people, state, and territory.

== History ==

The British geographer [[Halford Mackinder]] was also heavily influenced by environmental determinism and in developing his concept of the 'geographical pivot of history'  or the [[The Geographical Pivot of History|Heartland Theory]] (in 1904) he argued that the era of sea power was coming to an end and that land based powers were in the ascendant, and, in particular, that whoever controlled the heartland of 'Euro-Asia' would control the world.  This theory involved concepts diametrically opposed to the ideas of [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]] about the significance of ''sea power'' in world conflict.  The heartland theory hypothesized the possibility of a huge empire being created which didn't need to use coastal or transoceanic transport to supply its [[military–industrial complex]], and that this empire could not be defeated by the rest of the world allied against it.  This perspective proved influential throughout the period of the [[Cold War]], underpinning military thinking about the creation of [[buffer state]]s between East and West in central Europe.

The heartland theory depicted a world divided into a ''Heartland'' (Eastern Europe/Western Russia); ''World Island'' (Eurasia and Africa); ''Peripheral Islands'' (British Isles, Japan, Indonesia and Australia) and ''New World'' (The Americas). Mackinder argued that whoever controlled the Heartland would have control of the world. He used these ideas to politically influence events such as the [[Treaty of Versailles]], where buffer states were created between the [[USSR]] and [[Germany]], to prevent either of them controlling the Heartland.  At the same time, Ratzel was creating a theory of states based around the concepts of Lebensraum and [[Social Darwinism]].  He argued that states were analogous to 'organisms' that needed sufficient room in which to live.  Both of these writers created the idea of a political and geographical [[science]], with an [[Objectivity (journalism)|objective]] view of the world.  Prior to [[World War II]] political geography was concerned largely with these issues of global power struggles and influencing state policy, and the above theories were taken on board by German geopoliticians (see [[Geopolitik]]) such as [[Karl Haushofer]] who - perhaps inadvertently - greatly influenced [[Nazism|Nazi]] political theory, which was a form of politics seen to be legitimated by such 'scientific' theories.

The close association with environmental determinism and the freezing of political boundaries during the Cold War led to a significant decline in the perceived importance of political geography, which was described by Brian Berry in 1968 as a 'moribund backwater'.  Although at this time in most other areas of human geography new approaches, including quantitative spatial science, behavioural studies, and structural Marxism, were invigorating academic research these were largely ignored by political geographers whose main point of reference remained the regional approach.  As a result, most of the political geography texts produced during this period were descriptive, and it was not until 1976 that Richard Muir could argue that political geography was no longer a dead duck, but could in fact be a phoenix.

== Areas of study ==
[[File:13.8 scharf.png|thumb|right|The [[Brandenburg Gate]] of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1961.]]

From the late-1970s onwards, political geography has undergone a renaissance, and could fairly be described as one of the most dynamic of the sub-disciplines today. The revival was underpinned by the launch of the journal ''Political Geography Quarterly'' (and its expansion to bi-monthly production as ''Political Geography''). In part this growth has been associated with the adoption by political geographers of the approaches taken up earlier in other areas of human geography, for example, [[Ron J. Johnston]]'s (1979) work on electoral geography relied heavily on the adoption of quantitative spatial science, Robert Sack's (1986) work on territoriality was based on the behavioural approach, [[Henry Bakis]] (1987) showed the impact of information and telecommunications networks on political geography, and Peter Taylor's (e.g. 2007) work on World Systems Theory owed much to developments within structural Marxism.  However, the recent growth in vitality and importance of this sub-discipline is also related to the changes in the world as a result of the end of the Cold War.  With the emergence of a new world order (which as yet, is only poorly defined) and the development of new research agendas, such as the more recent focus on social movements and political struggles, going beyond the study of nationalism with its explicit territorial basis. There has also been increasing interest in the geography of green politics (see, for example, David Pepper's (1996) work), including the geopolitics of environmental protest, and in the capacity of our existing state apparatus and wider political institutions, to address any contemporary and future environmental problems competently.

Political geography has extended the scope of traditional political science approaches by acknowledging that the exercise of power is not restricted to states and bureaucracies, but is part of everyday life.  This has resulted in the concerns of political geography increasingly overlapping with those of other human geography sub-disciplines such as economic geography, and, particularly, with those of social and cultural geography in relation to the study of the politics of place (see, for example, the books by David Harvey (1996) and Joe Painter (1995)).  Although contemporary political geography maintains many of its traditional concerns (see below) the multi-disciplinary expansion into related areas is part of a general process within human geography which involves the blurring of boundaries between formerly discrete areas of study, and through which the discipline as a whole is enriched&lt;ref&gt;Simandan D. 2011. Kinds of environments—a framework for reflecting on the possible contours of a better world. The Canadian Geographer/Le Géographe canadien, 55(3), pp. 383-386.  https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1541-0064.2010.00334.x &lt;/ref&gt;.

In particular, contemporary political geography often considers:
* How and why states are organized into regional groupings, both formally (e.g. the [[European Union]]) and informally (e.g. the [[Third World]])
* The relationship between states and former colonies, and how these are propagated over time, for example through [[neo-colonialism]]
* The relationship between a [[government]] and its people
* The relationships between states including international trades and treaties
* The functions, demarcations and policing of boundaries

===Critical political geography===
{{See also|Critical geopolitics}}

Critical political geography is mainly concerned with the criticism of traditional political geographies vis-a-vis modern trends.  As with much of the move towards 'Critical geographies', the arguments have drawn largely from [[postmodern]], [[post structural]] and [[postcolonial]] theories&lt;ref&gt;Simandan D. 2010. Beware of contingency. Environment and planning. D: Society and Space, 28(3), pp. 388-396. https://doi.org/10.1068/d2310&lt;/ref&gt;.  Examples include:
* [[Feminist geography]], which argues for recognition of the power relations as [[patriarchal]] and attempts to theorise alternative conceptions of [[Personal identity|identity]] and [[identity politics]]&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, J., 2007. Geography and gender: Finding feminist political geographies. Progress in Human Geography, 31(3), pp.381-387.&lt;/ref&gt;. Alongside related concerns such as [[Queer theory]] and [[Youth studies]]
* [[Postcolonial]] theories which recognise the [[Imperialistic]], universalising nature of much political geography, especially in [[Development geography]]&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, J., 2003. Political geography in a postcolonial context. Political Geography, 22(6), pp.647-651.&lt;/ref&gt;.
* [[Environmental justice]] which addresses the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, or income with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Environmental Justice and Environmentalism: The Social Justice Challenge to the Environmental Movement|last=|first=|publisher=The MIT Press|year=2007|isbn=0262195526|location=|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, it is a human right for all people to share equally in the benefits bestowed by a healthy environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Environmental Justice Reader: Politics, Poetics, &amp; Pedagogy|last=|first=|publisher=The University of Arizona Press|year=2002|isbn=0816522065|location=|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7217">'''Ralph Davenport Mershon''' was an [[electrical engineer]] and [[inventor]]. His company Mershon Condensers was a successful manufacturer of [[electrolytic capacitor]]s for the expanding [[radio]] market of the 1920s. He is known for the Mershon Auditorium (1957) and the [[Mershon Center]] at his alma mater [[Ohio State University]] that his estate made possible. In 1956 a biography and summary of his work was published by Ohio State University; the following article is a digest of that publication.

==Life==
His father Ralph Smith Mershon was a [[watchmaker]], having apprenticed in Trenton, New Jersey and Philadelphia. He played [[violin]] and was an [[inventor]], devising a compound regulator for timepieces, and a repeating pistol similar to the [[Girandoni Air Rifle]]. In 1863 he purchased Henry Kruger jewelers in [[Zanesville, Ohio]]. R.S. Mershon married Mary Elizabeth Jones on November 12, 1863. Ralph Davenport Mershon was born on July 14, 1868. His sister Hope Lord Mershon was born in 1875 and lived to 1953, but their other siblings perished in infancy. The clock installed by Ralph Smith Mershon in the tower of [[Muskingum County Courthouse]] was still functioning in 1956.

Unsatisfied by classes at [[Zanesville High School]] in 1884, R.D. Mershon joined a crew [[surveying]] for a railroad. Working under Mr. Bateman, a surveyor, he gained hands-on experience with a transit and level. Bateman would not answer Mershon's questioning, referring him instead to the ''Handbook of Civil Engineering'' by  [[John Trautwine]]. From that point he learned to use reference works. Given that young Merson had an interest in mechanics, a coworker suggested he study at Ohio State. Returning to Zanesville, Mershon turned to [[superintendent of schools]] William D. Lash for examination and certification. Mershon was admitted to Ohio State in the fall of 1886. His skills being evident, in his senior year he served as student assistant. In 1890 he graduated with a degree in [[mechanical engineering]]. After graduation he was an assistant instructor in [[electrical engineering]]. Working with [[alternating current]] machinery, Mershon developed a means of [[waveform]] measurement. It is described as an instantaneous potentiometer method, employing  a telephone receiver to indicate balance. This work attracted the attention of the [[Westinghouse Electric Company]].

In 1891 he joined the Company in [[East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] where he designed [[transformer]]s for [[electrical power distribution]] systems. In 1896 he and [[Charles F. Scott (engineer)|Charles F. Scott]] were sent to [[Telluride, Colorado]] to carry out experiments on high-voltage transmissions. Their experiments went up to 133,000 [[volt]]s; they observed [[corona discharge]] along the [[transmission line]]s. The losses were ameliorated with thicker wires and greater separation. To gain experience in the deployment of a [[power grid]], Mershom took a [[leave of absence]] from Westinghouse to work with Colorado Electric Power in 1897/8. He returned to Westinghouse, serving for a short time in the [[New York City|New York]] office.

In 1900 Ralph Mershon became a [[consultant]] in electrical power transmission. He designed and supervised the construction of power systems in various states, [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]]. From 1905 he consulted with South African firms taking power from [[Victoria Falls]], and travelled there. From 1912 he consulted on a project at [[Inawashiro lake]] in Japan. He helped place visiting Japanese engineers with American manufacturers and power companies so that the necessary expertise could be acquired. Mershon became a Fellow of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] on January 2, 1906.

Mershon was a member of the [[Engineering Societies' Building and Engineers' Club|Engineer's Club]] in New York City. Their building was erected in 1907. In 1910 he was involved in the formation of an "Inventors' Guild" that included [[Thomas Edison]], [[Peter Cooper Hewitt]], [[Elmer Sperry]], [[Mihajlo Pupin]], [[Baekeland]], and others. These men were concerned with [[patent|patent law]], sometimes critically. Mershon was made a Life Member of the Engineers Club on January 26, 1950.

Mershon was president of [[AIEE]] in 1912. He is quoted making the wry observation that such posts went to men whose "chief claim to fame arise from activities in fields other than that of electrical engineering as defined by the Institute's constitution."&lt;ref&gt;John D. Ryder &amp; Donald G. Fink (1984) ''Engineers &amp; Electrons: A Century of Electrical Progress'', p 64, [[IEEE Press]],{{ISBN|0-87942-172-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mershon had many [[patent]]s for [[invention]]s he devised. One of the most celebrated was a compensating [[voltmeter]] that was awarded the [[John Scott Medal]] by Philadelphia. In 1916 Mershon advocated for the "Ohio Plan" of military preparedness on campuses that is embodied in the [[ROTC]]. In 1918 [[Tufts College]] awarded him an honorary Doctor of Science.

Mershon became a master of the art of building [[capacitor]]s, an important element not only of power systems but also in the electronics of radio.&lt;ref&gt;Henry B.O. Davis (1983) ''Electrical and Electronic Technologies: A Chronology of Events and Inventors from 1900 to 1940'', p 111: "The Mershon Company put electrolytic capacitors on the market. The capacitors packed a high capacitance in a very small space compared to existing paper capacitors.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1911 to 1942 he was granted 55 patents. His Mershon Condensers were featured in the popular [[Crosley Radio Corporation|Crosley brand radios]], and suppressed the 60 cps hum heard without them. In 1930 the Mershon company was bought by [[Magnavox]], and the brand was discontinued. However, the patent-holder continued to defend his interest with [[lawsuit]]s: Merson v. Robinson (30 June 1941) and Mershon v. Sprague (2 April 1936).

Ralph Mershon never married. He died February 14, 1952, in [[Coconut Grove, Florida]]. His Papers are preserved by Ohio State University Archives. In 1956 [[Ohio State University Press]] published a two-volume biography by Edith D. Cockins, who was [[registrar (education)|registrar]] of the University from 1895 to 1944. From the account, she came to know him first when the [[alumni association]] was invigorated by his Presidency. The first volume recounts Mershon's life and engineering projects, the second is an edited and annotated collection of his writings. His suggestions for the improvement of the patent system are found on pages 142 and 143 of volume one.

'''SETI@home beta''', using the [[Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing]] ([[BOINC]]) platform, is a test environment for the following future projects:

* [[AstroPulse]]: a [[distributed computing]] project searching for primordial [[black holes]], [[pulsars]], and [[SETI|ETI]]. AstroPulse clients have been tested by this project for nearly 6 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://setiweb.ssl.berkeley.edu/beta/old_news.php SETI@home official site news, AstroPulse first seen on 2 Dec 2005 and first ran on 30 May 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; It is already running on [[SETI@home]], testing new [[GPU]]/[[CPU]] optimized apps and performing other tasks.
* [[SETI Southern Hemisphere]] Search, which is another [[SETI@home]] project that is due to join BOINC in the future. It is expected that this project will use a slightly modified version of the ''SETI enhanced'' client, as the [[Parkes Observatory]] has a [[feedhorn]] with more beams than the [[Arecibo Observatory]].

==Applications Testing==
*11 Dec 2008, CUDA applications test
*3 Jun 2013, [[SETI@home]] v7 test
*01 Dec 2015 [[SETI@home]] v8 test

'''Semyon Ivanovich Chelyuskin''' ({{Lang-ru|Семён Иванович Челюскин}}) ([[circa|c.]] 1700 – 1764) was a Russian [[polar region|polar]] [[explorer]] and [[naval officer]].

Chelyuskin graduated from the [[Moscow School of Mathematics and Navigation|Navigation School in Moscow]]. He first became a [[Subordinate#Social hierarchies|deputy]] [[navigator]] while serving in the [[Baltic Fleet]] (1726) and later promoted to navigator (1733). Chelyuskin was chosen for the [[Second Kamchatka Expedition|Second (Great Northern) Kamchatka Expedition]], in which he took part until 1743. He participated in expeditions, led by [[Vasily Pronchischev]] and [[Khariton Laptev]]. In spring of 1741, Chelyuskin made a voyage from the [[Khatanga River]] to the [[Pyasina River]] by land. He described the western coastline from the [[Taimyr Peninsula]] to the [[Middendorff Bay]] and then from the mouth of Pyasina to the mouth of the [[Yenisei River]]. In winter of 1741–1742, he traveled from [[Turukhansk]] to the mouth of the Khatanga River, describing the northern coastline of the Taimyr Peninsula from the [[Faddey Bay]] on the East to the mouth of the [[Taimyra River]] on the West. Chelyuskin found the northern extremity of [[Asia]], which [[Aleksandr Fyodorovich Middendorf]] would later name after him in 1843 ([[Cape Chelyuskin]]).

He was discharged from the Baltic Fleet in the rank of a [[Captain (naval)|captain]] in 1760.

==Named in honor==
[[Cape Chelyuskin]] (the northernmost cape of [[Eurasia]]), Chelyuskin Peninsula (northern tip of [[Taymyr Peninsula|Taymyr]]), Chelyuskin Island near [[Taymyr Peninsula|Taymyr]], famous Soviet [[Chelyuskin steamship]] and some streets and settlements have been named after Chelyuskin.

In 1930s the [[Soviet Union]] operated a [[steamship]], built in [[Denmark]] in 1933, which was named after Semion Chelyuskin (see the [[Chelyuskin steamship]]). It sank in the [[Chukchi Sea]] near [[Kolyuchin Island]] during an ill-fated attempt to cover the [[Northern Sea Route]].

The '''Small Explorer program''' ('''SMEX''') is an effort within [[NASA]] to fund [[space exploration]] missions that cost no more than {{US$|120 million}}.&lt;ref name=missions&gt;{{cite web |url=http://explorers.gsfc.nasa.gov/missions.html |title=Explorers Missions |publisher=NASA |accessdate=28 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323182500/http://explorers.gsfc.nasa.gov/missions.html |archivedate=23 March 2010 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extending the larger [[Explorers program]], it was started in 1989.&lt;ref name=IEEE&gt;{{cite conference |title=SAMPEX: NASA's First Small Explorer Satellite |conference=IEEE Aerospace Conference. 21–28 March 1998.

== Program history ==
The first set of three SMEX missions were launched between 1992 and 1998. The second set of two missions were launched in 1998 and 1999. These missions were managed by the Small Explorer Project Office at NASA's [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] (GSFC). In early 1999, that office was closed and with the announcement of opportunity for the third set of SMEX missions NASA converted the program so that each mission was managed by its Principal Investigator, with oversight by the GSFC Explorers Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sunland.gsfc.nasa.gov/smex/ |title=Welcome to the Small Explorer's Web Site |publisher=NASA |date=18 February 2000 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000817054104/http://sunland.gsfc.nasa.gov/smex/ |archivedate=17 August 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2017, NASA is funding a competitive study of five candidate heliophysics Small Explorers missions, with the expectation that one finalist proposal will be selected as a mission for flight in 2022. The proposals are Mechanisms of Energetic Mass Ejection – eXplorer (MEME-X), Focusing Optics X-ray Solar Imager (FOXSI), Multi-Slit Solar Explorer (MUSE), Tandem Reconnection and Cusp Electrodynamics Reconnaissance Satellites (TRACERS), and Polarimeter to Unify the Corona and Heliosphere (PUNCH).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-selects-proposals-to-study-sun-space-environment |title=NASA Selects Proposals to Study Sun, Space Environment |publisher=NASA |first=Dwayne |last=Brown |date=28 July 2017 |accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/viewrepositorydocument/cmdocumentid=524225/solicitationId=%7BA0C496AC-9B9D-8F7D-A506-B1695BF9BDE8%7D/viewSolicitationDocument=1/2016%20Helio%20SMEX%20AO_amend1_clarify.pdf |title=Announcement of Opportunity: Heliophysics Explorers Program, 2016 Small Explorer (SMEX) |publisher=NASA |date=13 July 2016 |id=NNH16ZDA005O}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://explorers.larc.nasa.gov/HPSMEX/pdf_files/8_SMEX-AO-2016Helio-CSR-Kickoff-LSP-MENDOZA-HILL.pdf |title=Heliophysics Small Explorers 2016 Announcement of Opportunity: Concept Study Report Kickoff |publisher=NASA{{\}}Launch Services Program |first=Alicia |last=Mendoza-Hill |date=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sornfelli''' is a mountain plateau on the island of [[Streymoy]] in the [[Faroe Islands]] about 12&amp;nbsp;km from the capital [[Tórshavn]] (20&amp;nbsp;km by road). It is the site of a  military station at 725 m asl. The Sornfelli Meteorological Station installed in 1999 is located in the middle of the 40000 m2 Sornfelli Mountain top plateau at 725 m asl.

Temperatures at the meteorological station in 2000 were:
*Mean annual air temperature: +1.7&amp;nbsp;°C
*Mean coldest month (April): -2.2&amp;nbsp;°C
*Mean warmest month (August): 6.5&amp;nbsp;°C

From [[Tórshavn]] you can drive over the mountain road "Oyggjarvegin" to the Sornfelli Mountain plateau. There is a public road up to the Sornfelli Mountain plateau, but not the last 200 m to the radar base.
The mountain Sornfelli has a height of 749 m.

'''''The Weather of the Future: Heat Waves, Extreme Storms, and Other Scenes From a Climate-Changed Planet''''' ({{ISBN|978-0-06-172688-0}}) is a 2010 book by [[climatologist]] [[Heidi Cullen]]. Cullen takes as her starting point the "clear and present dangers" posed by the [[greenhouse gas]]es which result from the burning [[fossil fuel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Michiko Kakutani. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/03/books/03book.html?_r=1&amp;ref=books Warming Is Real. Now What?] ''New York Times'',  August 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; She offers a vision of what life might be like in a warmer world. Cullen predicts "more frequent and more violent storms, more hot spells, cold spells, droughts, famines and huge waves of desperate refugees".&lt;ref&gt;Carl Hartman.

'''WISE J0005+3737''', full designation '''WISE J000517.48+373720.5''', is a [[brown dwarf]] of [[spectral class]] T9,{{r|Kirkpatrick2012}} located in constellation [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]] at approximately 23 [[light-year]]s from [[Earth]].{{r|Kirkpatrick2012}}

==Discovery==
WISE J0005+3737 was discovered in 2012 by Mace et al. from data, collected by [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer]] (WISE) [[Earth-orbit]]ing [[satellite]] — [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]] [[infrared|infrared-wavelength]] 40 [[centimeter|cm]] (16 [[inch|in]]) [[space observatory|space telescope]], which mission lasted from December 2009 to February 2011. The discovery paper was published in March 2013.{{r|Mace2013}}

==Distance==
[[Trigonometric parallax]] of WISE J0005+3737 is not yet measured. Therefore, there are only distance estimates of this object, obtained by indirect — spectrophotometric — means (see table).
