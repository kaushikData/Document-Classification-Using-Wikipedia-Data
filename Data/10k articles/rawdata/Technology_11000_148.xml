An '''audio/video receiver''' (AVR) is a [[consumer electronics]] component used in a [[home cinema|home theater]]. Its purpose is to receive audio and video signals from a number of sources, and to process them to drive loudspeakers and displays such as a [[television]], [[computer monitor|monitor]] or [[video projector]]. Inputs may come from a [[satellite receiver]], [[radio]], [[DVD players]], [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray Disc players]], [[VCRs]] or [[video game console]]s. The AVR source selection and settings such as volume, are typically set by a [[remote controller]].

==Usage==
The term receiver basically refers to an [[amplifier]] that has a built-in radio tuner. With A/V receivers, the basic functionality is to receive an audio signal, amplify the audio signal, and allow pass-through of the corresponding video signal to a display device such as a projector or a television.

As home entertainment options expanded, so did the role of the receiver. The ability to handle a variety of digital audio signals was added. More amplifiers were added for surround-sound playback. Video switching was added to simplify changing from one device to another. Within the last few years, video processing has been added to many receivers.

The term audio/video receiver (AVR) or Home Theater Receiver is used to distinguish the multi-channel audio/video receiver (home theater receiver) from the simpler stereo receiver, though the primary function of both is amplification.

AV receivers may also be known as ''digital audio-video receivers'' or ''digital media renderers''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dlna.org/dlna-for-industry/digital-living/how-it-works/dlna-device-classes/digital-media-rendererDigital Media Renderer - DLNA Device Classes&lt;/ref&gt;

The AV receiver is classified as an [[electronic amplifier|audio frequency electronic amplifier]]. But with the rapid addition of several features, AV receivers now generally have significant additional functionality.

==Features==

===Channels===
Stereo receivers have two channels of amplification, while AV receivers may have more than two. The standard for AV receivers is five channels of amplification. These are usually referred to as 5.1 receivers. This provides for a left, right, center, left surround and right surround speaker to be powered by the receiver. 7.1 receivers are becoming more common and provide for two additional surround channels, left rear surround and right rear surround. The ".1" refers to the LFE (low-frequency effects/bass) channel, the signal of which is usually sent to an amplified subwoofer unit. 5.1 and 7.1 receivers don't usually provide amplification for this channel. Instead, they provide a [[line level]] output.

===Amplifier power===
Audio amplifier power, normally specified in Watts, is not always as significant as it may seem from the specification. Due to the logarithmic nature of human hearing, audio power or sound pressure level (SPL), must be increased by ten times to sound twice as loud. This is why SPL is measured on a logarithmic scale in decibels (dBs). An increase of 10dBs results in a perceived doubling of loudness. Another complication with human hearing is that as the SPL decreases the perceived volume of the low and high frequencies decreases faster than the central frequencies around 2&amp;nbsp;kHz.

There are different standards for rating amplifier power depending on country, manufacturer, and model. Other factors also come into play: distortion, headroom, speaker efficiency. Thus, it is possible for an amplifier with a specified lower power to sound louder than an amplifier with a specified higher power.

Because of these factors, it is not easy to compare the perceived loudness of amplifiers solely from their specified power in Watts.

===Decoders===
AV receivers usually provide one or more decoders for sources with more than two channels of audio information. This is most common with movie soundtracks, which use one of a variety of different types of encoding formats.

The first common soundtrack format was [[Dolby Pro Logic]], a surround sound processing technology. This format contains a [[center channel]] and a surround channel mixed into the left and right channels using a process called matrixing, providing a total of four channels. Receivers with Dolby Pro Logic decoders can separate out the center and surround channels from the left and right channels.

With the introduction of the [[DVD]], the [[Dolby Digital]] format became a standard. Dolby Digital ready receivers included inputs and amplifiers for the additional channels. Most current AV receivers provide a [[Dolby Digital]] decoder and at least one digital [[S/PDIF]] input which can be connected to a source which provides a [[Dolby Digital]] output.

A somewhat less common surround sound decoder called [[DTS (sound system)|DTS]] is standard on current AV receivers.

When Dolby Labs and DTS introduced technologies to add a rear center surround channel, these technologies found their way into AV Receivers. Receivers with six amplifiers (known as 6.1 receivers) will typically have both Dolby and DTS's technologies. These are [[Dolby Digital EX]] and [[DTS ES]].

Dolby introduced [[Dolby Pro Logic II]] to allow stereo sources to play back as if they were encoded in surround sound. DTS introduced a similar technology, [[DTS (sound system)#DTS Neo:6|Neo:6]]. These decoders have become common on most current receivers.

As the number of playback channels were increased on receivers, other decoders have been added to some receivers. For example, Dolby Labs created [[Dolby Pro Logic IIx]] to take advantage of receivers with more than five channels of playback.

With the introduction of high definition players (e.g. [[Blu-ray Disc]] and [[HD DVD]]), yet more decoders have been added to some receivers. Lossless [[Dolby TrueHD]] and [[DTS-HD Master Audio]] decoders are available on many receivers.

While Dolby Digital has been the standard for television and video games,  Dolby Digital Plus has been adopted for online streaming services such as Netflix, and adds a much higher bit rate and can support more channels.

[[Dolby Atmos]] and DTS:X adds in ceiling height channels.

===DSP effects===
Most receivers offer specialized [[Digital Signal Processing|Digital Signal Processors]] (DSP) made for handling various presets and audio effects. Some may offer simple equalizers and balance adjustments to complex DSP audio field simulations such as "Hall", "Arena", "Opera", etc. that simulate or attempt to replicate as if the audio were being played in the places through use of surround sound and echo effects.

===AV inputs/outputs===
There are a variety of possible connections on an AV receiver. Standard connectors include:

* Analog audio ([[RCA connector]], or occasionally [[XLR connector]])
* Digital audio ([[S/PDIF]]; [[TOSLINK]] or RCA terminated [[coaxial cable]])
* [[Composite video]] (RCA connector)
* [[S-Video]]
* [[SCART]] video (primarily used in Europe and very uncommon in many other parts of the world)
* [[Component video]]
* [[High-Definition Multimedia Interface|HDMI]]
* [[USB]] (usually involves special computer circuitry to read video formats from a file system)

Analog audio connections usually use RCA plugs in stereo pairs. Inputs and outputs are both common. Outputs are provided mainly for cassette tape decks.

Analog audio connections using XLR (Balanced) connectors are uncommon, and are usually found on more expensive receivers.

Some receivers are also equipped with phono inputs, for connecting a turntable with a magnetic cartridge, although many receivers are lacking this input. In the last years, since vinyl players are gaining popularity, there are some manufacturers of A/V receivers which are offering a phono input on some models. Some receivers also have a selector for either MM/MC cartridge type. This feature is mainly offered to allow people owning a turntable to connect it and listen to their vinyl collection. Most receivers will only play in stereo, either front or main speakers, but some receivers may play on all speakers deppending on the manufacturer and model.

Digital connections allow for the transmission of [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]], [[Dolby Digital]] or [[DTS Coherent Acoustics|DTS]] audio. Common devices include CD players, DVD players, or satellite receivers.

Composite video connections use a single RCA plug on each end. Composite video is standard on all AV receivers allowing for the switching of video devices such as VHS players, cable boxes, and game consoles. DVD players may be connected via composite video connectors although a higher bandwidth connection is recommended.

S-Video connections offer better quality than composite video. It uses a DIN jack.

SCART connections generally offer the best quality video at standard-definition, due to the use of pure RGB signalling (although composite and S-Video may alternatively be offered over a SCART connector). SCART provides video and audio in one connection.

Component video has become the best connection for analog video as higher definitions such as [[720p]] have become common. The [[YPbPr]] signalling provides a good compromise between resolution and colour definition.

HDMI is becoming common on AV receivers. It provides for the transmission of both audio and video. HDMI is a relatively new technology and there are reported issues with devices not properly working with each other (referred to as hand-shake issues between devices), especially cable/satellite boxes connected to a display through an AV receiver. Different levels of support are provided by receivers with HDMI connections. Some will only switch video and not provide for audio processing. Some will not handle multi-channel [[LPCM]]. Multi-channel LPCM is a common way for [[Blu-ray Disc]] and [[HD DVD]] players to transmit the best possible audio.

===Video conversion and upscaling===
Some AV Receivers can convert from one video format to another. This is commonly called [[Video scaler|upconversion]] or [[transcoding]]. A smaller number of receivers provide for [[Line doubler|de-interlacing]] of video signals. For example, a receiver with upconversion, deinterlacing and upscaling can take an interlaced composite signal at [[480i]] (480 lines per frame sent as a field of 240 even numbered lines 0,2,4,8...478 followed by a field of 240 odd numbered lines 1,3,5,...479) and convert it to component video while also deinterlacing and upscaling it to a higher resolution such as [[720p]] (720 lines per frame with all lines in normal sequence 0,1,2...719).

===Radio on AVRs===
AV receivers though primarily used for amplification may or may not have an inbuilt AM/FM radio tuner among other features such as LAN connectivity for various Internet applications and some with multi-room audio solutions.

Even though some AVRs may have an AM/FM tuner it is not a primary or mandatory function as an AVR still remains an amplifier.

Some models have [[HD Radio]] tuners.

Some models have [[Internet radio]] and PC streaming access capabilities with an Ethernet port.

In [[computer science]], the [[Actor model]], first published in 1973 {{harv|Hewitt et al.|1973}}, is a mathematical model of [[concurrent computation]].  This article reports on the middle history of the Actor model in which major themes were initial implementations, initial applications, and development of the first proof theory and denotational model.  It is the follow on article to [[Actor model early history]] which reports on the early history of the Actor model which concerned the basic development of the concepts.  The article [[Actor model later history]] reports on developments after the ones reported in this article.

==Proving properties of Actor systems==
[[Carl Hewitt]] [1974] published the principle of Actor induction which is:
#Suppose that an Actor &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt; has property &lt;tt&gt;P&lt;/tt&gt; when it is created
#Further suppose that if &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt; has property &lt;tt&gt;P&lt;/tt&gt; when it processes a message, then it has property &lt;tt&gt;P&lt;/tt&gt; when it processes the next message.
#Then &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt; always has the property &lt;tt&gt;P&lt;/tt&gt;.
In his doctoral dissertation, Aki Yonezawa developed further techniques for proving properties of Actor systems including those that make use of [[Actor model and process calculi#Migration|migration]].  Russ Atkinson and Carl Hewitt developed techniques for proving properties of Serializers that are guardians of shared resources.  Gerry Barber's doctoral dissertation concerned reasoning about change in knowledgeable office systems.

==Garbage Collection==
[[Garbage collection (computer science)|Garbage collection]] (the automatic reclamation of unused storage) was an important theme in the development of the Actor model.

In his doctoral dissertation, Peter Bishop developed an algorithm for garbage collection in distributed systems.  Each system kept lists of links of pointers to and from other systems.  Cyclic structures were collected by incrementally migrating Actors (objects) onto other systems which had their addresses until a cyclic structure was entirely contained in a single system where the garbage collector could recover the storage.

[[Henry Baker (computer scientist)|Henry Baker]] developed an algorithm for real-time garbage collection in his doctoral dissertation.  The fundamental idea was to interleave collection activity with construction activity so that there would not have to be long pauses while collection takes place.  See [[Garbage collection (computer science)#Stop-the-world vs. incremental vs. concurrent|incremental garbage collection]].

Henry Lieberman and Carl Hewitt [1983] developed a real time garbage collection based on the lifetimes of Actors (Objects).  The fundamental idea was to allocate Actors (objects) in generations so that only the latest generations would have to be examined during a garbage collection. See [[Garbage collection (computer science)#Generational GC .28aka Ephemeral GC.29|generational garbage collection]].

==Actor programming languages==
Henry Lieberman, Dan Theriault, ''et al.'' developed Act1, an Actor programming language.  Subsequently for his masters thesis, Dan Theriault developed Act2.  These early proof of concept languages were rather inefficient and not suitable for applications.  In his doctoral dissertation, Ken Kahn developed Ani, which he used to develop several animations.  Bill Kornfeld developed the Ether programming language for the [[Scientific Community Metaphor]] in his doctoral dissertation.  William Athas and Nanette Boden [1988] developed Cantor which is an Actor programming language for scientific computing.  Jean-Pierre Briot [1988, 1999] developed means to extend Smalltalk 80 for Actor computations.  Christine Tomlinson, Mark Scheevel, Greg Lavender, Greg Meredith, ''et al.'' [1995] at MCC developed an Actor programming language for InfoSleuth agents in Rosette.

Carl Hewitt, Beppe Attardi, and Henry Lieberman [1979] developed proposals for delegation in message passing.  This gave rise to the so-called inheritance anomaly controversy in object-oriented concurrent programming languages [Satoshi Matsuoka and Aki Yonezawa 1993, Giuseppe Milicia and Vladimiro Sassone 2004].

==A denotational model of Actor systems==
In his doctoral dissertation, Will Clinger developed the first denotational model of Actor systems.  See [[denotational semantics of the Actor model]].

'''Animation''' is a method in which pictures are manipulated to appear as moving images. In [[traditional animation]], images are drawn or painted by hand on transparent [[cel|celluloid sheets]] to be photographed and exhibited on [[film]]. Today most animations are made with [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI). [[Computer animation]] can be very detailed [[3D computer graphics|3D animation]], while [[2D computer graphics|2D computer animation]] can be used for stylistic reasons, low bandwidth or faster real-time renderings. Other common animation methods apply a [[stop motion]] technique to two and three-dimensional objects like [[cutout animation|paper cutouts]], [[puppet]]s or [[Clay animation|clay figures]].

Commonly the effect of animation is achieved by a rapid succession of sequential images that minimally differ from each other. The illusion&amp;mdash;as in motion pictures in general&amp;mdash;is thought to rely on the [[phi phenomenon]] and [[beta movement]], but the exact causes are still uncertain. 
[[Analog device|Analog]] mechanical animation media that rely on the rapid display of sequential images include the [[phenakistiscope|phénakisticope]], [[zoetrope]], [[flip book]], [[praxinoscope]] and film. [[Television]] and [[video]] are popular electronic animation media that originally were [[analog device|analog]] and now operate [[digital media|digitally]]. For display on the computer, techniques like [[animated GIF]] and [[Flash animation]] were developed.

Apart from [[short films]], [[feature films]], animated gifs and other media dedicated to the display moving images, animation is also heavily used for [[video game]]s, [[motion graphics]] and [[special effect]]s.

The physical movement of image parts through simple mechanics in for instance the moving images in [[magic lantern]] shows can also be considered animation. Mechanical animation of actual robotic devices is known as [[animatronics]].

[[Animator]]s are artists who specialize in creating animation.

==Etymology==
The word "animation" stems from the Latin "animationem" (nominative "animatio"), noun of action from past participle stem of "animare", meaning "the action of imparting life". The primary meaning of the English word is "liveliness" and has been in use much longer than the meaning of "moving image medium".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dictionary.com/browse/animation&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Main|History of animation}}
[[File:Phenakistoscope 3g07690u.jpg|thumb|right|A [[phenakistoscope]] disc by [[Eadweard Muybridge]] (1893)]]
The history of animation started long before the development of [[cinematography]]. Humans have probably attempted to depict motion as far back as the [[paleolithic]] period. [[Shadow play]] and the [[magic lantern]] offered popular shows with moving images as the result of manipulation by hand and/or some minor mechanics.

[[Charles-Émile Reynaud]] further developed his projection praxinoscope into the [[Théâtre Optique]] with transparent hand-painted colorful pictures in a long perforated strip wound between two spools, patented in December 1888. From 28 October 1892 to March 1900 Reynaud gave over 12,800 shows to a total of over 500.000 visitors at the [[Musée Grévin]] in Paris. His ''Pantomimes Lumineuses'' series of animated films each contained 300 to 700 frames that were manipulated back and forth to last 10 to 15 minutes per film. Piano music, song and some dialogue were performed live, while some sound effects were synchronized with an electromagnet.

When film became a common medium some manufacturers of optical toys adapted small magic lanterns into toy film projectors for short loops of film. By 1902, they were producing many [[chromolithography]] film loops, usually by tracing live-action film footage (much like the later [[rotoscoping]] technique).

Some early filmmakers, including [[J. Stuart Blackton]], [[Arthur Melbourne-Cooper]], [[Segundo de Chomón]] and [[Edwin S. Porter]] experimented with stop-motion animation, possibly since around 1899. Blackton's ''The Haunted Hotel'' (1907) was the first huge success that baffled audiences with objects apparently moving by themselves and inspired other filmmakers to try the technique for themselves.

J. Stuart Blackton also experimented with animation drawn on blackboards and some [[cutout animation]] in ''[[Humorous Phases of Funny Faces]]'' (1906).

[[File:Fantasmagorie (Cohl).GIF|thumb|The oldest known animated film created by using what became known as [[traditional animation|traditional (hand-drawn) animation]]—the 1908 ''[[Fantasmagorie (1908 film)|Fantasmagorie]]'' by [[Émile Cohl]]]]
In 1908, [[Émile Cohl]]'s ''[[Fantasmagorie (1908 film)|Fantasmagorie]]'' was released with a white-on-black chalkline look created with [[Negative (photography)|negative prints]] from black ink drawings on white paper.{{sfn|Crafton|1993|pp=60–61}} The film largely consists of a [[stick figure]] moving about and encountering all kinds of [[morphing]] objects, including a wine bottle that transforms into a flower.&lt;ref name="Harryhausen_Dalton42"/&gt;

Inspired by Émile Cohl's stop-motion film ''Les allumettes animées [Animated Matches]'' (1908), [[Ladislas Starevich]] started making his influential puppet animations in 1910.

[[Winsor McCay]]'s ''[[Little Nemo (1911 film)|Little Nemo]]'' (1911) showcased very detailed drawings.  His ''[[Gertie the Dinosaur]]'' (1914) was an also an early example of character development in drawn animation.{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=171}}

During the 1910s, the production of animated short films typically referred to as "[[animated cartoon|cartoons]]", became an industry of its own and cartoon shorts were produced for showing in movie theaters.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=28}} The most successful producer at the time was [[John Randolph Bray]], who, along with animator [[Earl Hurd]], patented the [[cel animation]] process that dominated the animation industry for the rest of the decade.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=24}}{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=34}}

''[[El Apóstol]]'' (Spanish: "The Apostle") was a 1917 Argentine animated film utilizing cutout animation, and the world's first animated feature film.{{sfn|Finkielman|2004}}{{sfn|Crafton|1993|p=378}} Unfortunately, a fire that destroyed producer Federico Valle's film studio incinerated the only known copy of ''El Apóstol'', and it is now considered a [[lost film]].{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=25}}{{sfn|Bendazzi|1996}}

The earliest extant feature-length animated film is [[The Adventures of Prince Achmed]] (1926) made by director [[Lotte Reiniger]] and her collaborators [[Carl Koch (director)|Carl Koch]] and [[Berthold Bartosch]].

In 1932, the first short animated film created entirely with [[Technicolor]] (using red/green/blue photographic filters and three strips of film) was [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Flowers and Trees]]'', directed by [[Burt Gillett]]. But, the first feature film that was done with this technique, apart from the movie The Vanities Fair (1935), by Rouben Mamoulian, was "[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]", also by Walt Disney.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.esquire.com/es/actualidad/cine/a10335017/primera-pelicula-color/|title=¿Cuál fue la primera película en color?|date=2017-08-02|work=Esquire|access-date=2017-12-07|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, [[Hanna-Barbera]] released ''[[The Huckleberry Hound Show]]'', the first half hour television program to feature only in animation.{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|pp=234–235}} [[Terrytoons]] released ''[[Tom Terrific]]'' that same year.{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=61}}{{sfn|Solomon|1989|pp=239–240}} Television significantly decreased public attention to the animated shorts being shown in theaters.{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|pp=234–235}}

[[Computer animation]] has become popular since ''[[Toy Story]]'' (1995), the first feature-length animated film completely made using this technique.{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=432}}

In 2008, the animation market was worth US$68.4 billion.{{sfn|Board of Investments|2009}} Animation as an art and industry continues to thrive as of the mid-2010s because well-made animated projects can find audiences across borders and in all [[Four-quadrant movie|four quadrants]].

== Techniques ==

=== Traditional animation ===

{{Main|Traditional animation}}

[[File:Animhorse.gif|thumb|An example of traditional animation, a horse animated by [[rotoscoping]] from [[Eadweard Muybridge]]'s 19th-century photos]]

'''Traditional animation''' (also called cel animation or hand-drawn animation) was the process used for most animated films of the 20th century.{{sfn|White|2006|p=31}} The individual frames of a traditionally animated film are photographs of drawings, first drawn on paper.{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=153}} To create the illusion of movement, each drawing differs slightly from the one before it. The animators' drawings are traced or photocopied onto transparent acetate sheets called [[cel]]s,{{sfn|Thomas|Johnston|1981|pp=277–279}} which are filled in with paints in assigned colors or tones on the side opposite the line drawings.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=203}} The completed character cels are photographed one-by-one against a painted background by a [[rostrum camera]] onto motion picture film.{{sfn|White|2006|pp=195–201}}

The traditional cel animation process became obsolete by the beginning of the 21st century. Today, animators' drawings and the backgrounds are either scanned into or drawn directly into a computer system.{{sfn|Buchan|2013}}{{sfn|White|2006|p=394}} Various software programs are used to color the drawings and simulate camera movement and effects.{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=296}} The final animated piece is output to one of several delivery media, including traditional [[35&amp;nbsp;mm film]] and newer media with [[digital video]].{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=35–36, 52–53}}{{sfn|Buchan|2013}} The "look" of traditional cel animation is still preserved, and the [[character animator]]s' work has remained essentially the same over the past 70 years.{{sfn|Williams|2001|pp=52–57}} Some animation producers have used the term "tradigital" (a play on the words "traditional" and "digital") to describe cel animation that uses significant computer technology.

Examples of traditionally animated feature films include ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' (United States, 1940),{{sfn|Solomon|1989|pp=63–65}} ''[[Animal Farm (1954 film)|Animal Farm]]'' (United Kingdom, 1954), ''[[Lucky and Zorba]]'' (Italy, 1998), and ''[[The Illusionist (2010 film)|The Illusionist]]'' (British-French, 2010). Traditionally animated films produced with the aid of computer technology include ''[[The Lion King]]'' (US, 1994), ''[[The Prince of Egypt]]'' (US, 1998), ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'' (Japan, 1988),{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=80}} ''[[Spirited Away]]'' (Japan, 2001), ''[[The Triplets of Belleville]]'' (France, 2003), and ''[[The Secret of Kells]]'' (Irish-French-Belgian, 2009).

==== Full animation ====
'''Full animation''' refers to the process of producing high-quality traditionally animated films that regularly use detailed drawings and plausible movement,{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=71}} having a smooth animation.{{sfn|Culhane|1990|pp=194–195}} Fully animated films can be made in a variety of styles, from more realistically animated works like those produced by the [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney studio]] (''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'', ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', ''[[The Lion King]]'') to the more 'cartoon' styles of the [[Warner Bros. Cartoons|Warner Bros. animation studio]]. Many of the [[Disney animated features]] are examples of full animation, as are non-Disney works, ''[[The Secret of NIMH]]'' (US, 1982), ''[[The Iron Giant]]'' (US, 1999), and ''[[Nocturna (Film)|Nocturna]]'' (Spain, 2007). Fully animated films are animated at 24 frames per second, with a combination of animation on ones and twos, meaning that drawings can be held for one frame out of 24 or two frames out of 24.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=25–26}}

==== Limited animation ====

{{Main|Limited animation}}

'''[[Limited animation]]''' involves the use of less detailed or more stylized drawings and methods of movement usually a choppy or "skippy" movement animation.{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=142}} Limited animation uses fewer drawings per second, thereby limiting the fluidity of the animation. This is a more economic technique. Pioneered by the artists at the American studio [[United Productions of America]],{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|pp=54–55}} limited animation can be used as a method of stylized artistic expression, as in ''[[Gerald McBoing-Boing]]'' (US, 1951), ''[[Yellow Submarine (1968 film)|Yellow Submarine]]'' (UK, 1968), and certain [[anime]] produced in Japan.{{sfn|Ledoux|1997|p=24, 29}} Its primary use, however, has been in producing cost-effective animated content for media for television (the work of [[Hanna-Barbera]],{{sfn|Lawson|Persons|2004|p=82}} [[Filmation]],{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=241}} and other TV animation studios{{sfn|Lawson|Persons|2004|p=xxi}}) and later [[the Internet]] ([[web cartoon]]s).

==== Rotoscoping ====

{{Main|Rotoscoping}}

'''[[Rotoscoping]]''' is a technique patented by [[Max Fleischer]] in 1917 where animators trace live-action movement, frame by frame.{{sfn|Crafton|1993|p=158}} The source film can be directly copied from actors' outlines into animated drawings,{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=163–164}} as in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' (US, 1978), or used in a stylized and expressive manner, as in ''[[Waking Life]]'' (US, 2001) and ''[[A Scanner Darkly (film)|A Scanner Darkly]]'' (US, 2006). Some other examples are ''[[Fire and Ice (1983 film)|Fire and Ice]]'' (US, 1983), ''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]'' (1981), and ''[[The Flowers of Evil (manga)|Aku no Hana]]'' (2013).

==== Live-action/animation ====

{{Main|Films with live action and animation}}

'''[[Films with live action and animation|Live-action/animation]]''' is a technique combining hand-drawn characters into live action shots or live action actors into animated shots.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=162–163}} One of the earlier uses was in [[Koko the Clown]] when Koko was drawn over live action footage.{{sfn|Beck|2004|pp=18–19}} Other examples include ''[[Allegro Non Troppo]]'' (Italy, 1976), ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' (US, 1988), ''[[Space Jam]]'' (US, 1996) and ''[[Osmosis Jones]]'' (US, 2001).

=== Stop motion animation ===
{{Main|Stop motion}}

'''Stop-motion animation''' is used to describe animation created by physically manipulating real-world objects and photographing them one frame of film at a time to create the illusion of movement.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=299}} There are many different types of stop-motion animation, usually named after the medium used to create the animation.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=159}} Computer software is widely available to create this type of animation; traditional stop motion animation is usually less expensive but more time-consuming to produce than current computer animation.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=159}}

* '''[[Puppet animation]]''' typically involves stop-motion puppet figures interacting in a constructed environment, in contrast to real-world interaction in model animation.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=171}} The puppets generally have an [[armature (sculpture)|armature]] inside of them to keep them still and steady to constrain their motion to particular joints.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=155–156}} Examples include ''[[The Tale of the Fox]]'' (France, 1937), ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' (US, 1993), ''[[Corpse Bride]]'' (US, 2005), ''[[Coraline (film)|Coraline]]'' (US, 2009), the films of [[Jiří Trnka]] and the adult animated sketch-comedy television series ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' (US, 2005–present).
** '''[[Puppetoon]]''', created using techniques developed by [[George Pal]],{{sfn|Beck|2004|p=70}} are puppet-animated films that typically use a different version of a puppet for different frames, rather than simply manipulating one existing puppet.{{sfn|Beck|2004|pp=92–93}}
[[File:Claychick.jpg|thumb|A clay animation scene from a [[Finland|Finnish]] television commercial]]
* '''[[Clay animation]]''', or [[Plasticine]] animation (often called ''claymation'', which, however, is a [[Laika (company)|trademark]]ed name), uses figures made of clay or a similar malleable material to create stop-motion animation.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=299}}{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=150-151}} The figures may have an [[armature (sculpture)|armature]] or wire frame inside, similar to the related puppet animation (below), that can be manipulated to pose the figures.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=151–154}} Alternatively, the figures may be made entirely of clay, in the films of [[Bruce Bickford (animator)|Bruce Bickford]], where clay creatures morph into a variety of different shapes. Examples of clay-animated works include ''[[Gumby|The Gumby Show]]'' (US, 1957–1967), ''[[Mio Mao]]'' (Italy, 1974-2005), ''[[Morph (animation)|Morph]]'' shorts (UK, 1977–2000), ''[[Wallace and Gromit]]'' shorts (UK, as of 1989), [[Jan Švankmajer]]'s ''[[Dimensions of Dialogue]]'' ([[Czechoslovakia]], 1982), ''[[The Trap Door]]'' (UK, 1984). Films include ''[[Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit]]'', ''[[Chicken Run]]'' and ''[[The Adventures of Mark Twain (1985 film)|The Adventures of Mark Twain]]''.{{sfn|Beck|2004|p=250}}
** '''[[Strata-cut animation]]''', Strata-cut animation is most commonly a form of clay animation in which a long bread-like "loaf" of clay, internally packed tight and loaded with varying imagery, is sliced into thin sheets, with the animation camera taking a frame of the end of the loaf for each cut, eventually revealing the movement of the internal images within.{{sfn|Furniss|1998|pp=52–54}}
* '''[[Cutout animation]]''' is a type of stop-motion animation produced by moving two-dimensional pieces of material paper or cloth.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=59–60}} Examples include [[Terry Gilliam]]'s animated sequences from ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' (UK, 1969–1974); ''[[Fantastic Planet]]'' (France/Czechoslovakia, 1973) ; ''[[Tale of Tales (1979 film)|Tale of Tales]]'' (Russia, 1979), The pilot episode of the adult television sitcom series (and sometimes in episodes) of ''[[South Park]]'' (US, 1997) and the music video [[Live for the moment]], from Verona Riots band (produced by Alberto Serrano and Nívola Uyá, Spain 2014).
** '''[[Silhouette animation]]''' is a variant of cutout animation in which the characters are backlit and only visible as silhouettes.{{sfn|Culhane|1990|pp=170–171}} Examples include ''[[The Adventures of Prince Achmed]]'' ([[Weimar Republic]], 1926) and ''[[Ciné si|Princes et princesses]]'' (France, 2000).
* '''[[Model animation]]''' refers to stop-motion animation created to interact with and exist as a part of a live-action world.{{sfn|Harryhausen|Dalton|2008|pages=9–11}} Intercutting, [[matte (filmmaking)|matte]] effects and split screens are often employed to blend stop-motion characters or objects with live actors and settings.&lt;ref name="Harryhausen_Dalton222–226"/&gt; Examples include the work of [[Ray Harryhausen]], as seen in films, ''[[Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]'' (1963),&lt;ref name="Harryhausen_Dalton18"/&gt; and the work of [[Willis H. O'Brien]] on films, ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' (1933).
** '''[[Go motion]]''' is a variant of model animation that uses various techniques to create  [[motion blur]] between frames of film, which is not present in traditional stop-motion.{{sfn|Smith|1986|p=90}} The technique was invented by [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]] and [[Phil Tippett]] to create [[special effect]] scenes for the film ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980).{{sfn|Watercutter|2012}} Another example is the dragon named "Vermithrax" from ''[[Dragonslayer (1981 film)|Dragonslayer]]'' (1981 film).{{sfn|Smith|1986|pages=91–95}}
* '''[[Object animation]]''' refers to the use of regular inanimate objects in stop-motion animation, as opposed to specially created items.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=51–57}}
** '''[[Graphic animation]]''' uses non-drawn flat visual graphic material (photographs, newspaper clippings, magazines, etc.), which are sometimes manipulated frame-by-frame to create movement.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=128}} At other times, the graphics remain stationary, while the stop-motion camera is moved to create on-screen action.
** '''[[Brickfilm]]''' are a subgenre of object animation involving using [[Lego]] or other similar brick toys to make an animation.{{sfn|Paul|2005|pages=357–363}}{{sfn|Herman|2014}} These have had a recent boost in popularity with the advent of video sharing sites, [[YouTube]] and the availability of cheap cameras and animation software.{{sfn|Haglund|2014}}
* '''[[Pixilation]]''' involves the use of live humans as stop motion characters.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=75–79}} This allows for a number of surreal effects, including disappearances and reappearances, allowing people to appear to slide across the ground, and other effects.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=75–79}} Examples of pixilation include ''[[The Secret Adventures of Tom Thumb]]'' and ''[[Angry Kid]]'' shorts, and the [[academy award]]-winning ''[[Neighbours (1952 film)|Neighbours]]'' by [[Norman McLaren]].

=== Computer animation ===
{{Main|Computer animation}}
'''Computer animation''' encompasses a variety of techniques, the unifying factor being that the animation is created digitally on a computer.{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=296}}{{sfn|Serenko|2007}} 2D animation techniques tend to focus on image manipulation while 3D techniques usually build virtual worlds in which characters and objects move and interact.{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=405}} 3D animation can create images that seem real to the viewer.{{sfn|Serenko|2007|p=482}}

==== 2D animation ====
{{main|2D computer graphics}}
[[File:Catenary animation.gif|thumb|A 2D animation of two circles joined by a chain]]

[[2D computer graphics|2D animation]] figures are created or edited on the computer using 2D [[Raster graphics|bitmap graphics]] and 2D [[vector graphics]].{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=165}} This includes automated computerized versions of traditional animation techniques, [[Interpolation|interpolated]] [[morphing]],{{sfn|Sito|2013|pp=32, 70, 132}} [[onion skinning]]{{sfn|Priebe|2006|pp=71–72}} and interpolated rotoscoping.

2D animation has many applications, including [[Scanimate|analog computer animation]], [[Flash animation]], and [[PowerPoint animation]]. [[Cinemagraph]]s are [[still photograph]]s in the form of an [[animated GIF]] file of which part is animated.{{sfn|White|2006|p=392}}

Final line advection animation is a technique used in 2D animation,{{sfn|Lowe|Schnotz|2008|pp=246–247}} to give artists and animators more influence and control over the final product as everything is done within the same department.{{sfn|Masson|2007|pp=127–128}} Speaking about using this approach in ''[[Paperman]]'', John Kahrs said that "Our animators can change things, actually erase away the CG underlayer if they want, and change the profile of the arm."{{sfn|Beck|2012}}

==== 3D animation ====
{{Main|Computer animation|3D computer graphics}}
3D animation is digitally modeled and manipulated by an animator. The animator usually starts by creating a 3D [[polygon mesh]] to manipulate.{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=88}} A mesh typically includes many vertices that are connected by edges and faces, which give the visual appearance of form to a 3D object or 3D environment.{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=88}} Sometimes, the mesh is given an internal digital skeletal structure called an [[Armature (computer animation)|armature]] that can be used to control the mesh by weighting the vertices.{{sfn|Sito|2013|p=208}}{{sfn|Masson|2007|pp=78–80}} This process is called rigging and can be used in conjunction with keyframes to create movement.{{sfn|Sito|2013|p=285}}

Other techniques can be applied, mathematical functions (e.g., gravity, particle simulations), simulated fur or hair, and effects, fire and water simulations.{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=96}} These techniques fall under the category of 3D dynamics.{{sfn|Lowe|Schnotz|2008|p=92}}

===== 3D terms =====
* '''[[Cel-shaded animation]]''' is used to mimic traditional animation using computer software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cel Shading: the Unsung Hero of Animation?|url=http://www.animatormag.com/computer/cel-shading-hero-animation/|publisher=Animator Mag|accessdate=20 February 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305090445/http://www.animatormag.com/computer/cel-shading-hero-animation/|archivedate=5 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shading looks stark, with less blending of colors. Examples include ''[[Skyland]]'' (2007, France), ''[[The Iron Giant]]'' (1999, United States), ''[[Futurama]]'' (Fox, 1999) ''[[Appleseed Ex Machina]]'' (2007, Japan), ''[[The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker]]'' (2002, Japan), ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild]]'' (2017, Japan)
* '''[[Machinima]]''' – Films created by screen capturing in video games and virtual worlds. The term originated from the software introduction in the 1980s [[demoscene]], as well as the 1990s recordings of the [[first-person shooter]] video game ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]''.
* '''[[Motion capture]]''' is used when live-action actors wear special suits that allow computers to copy their movements into CG characters.{{sfn|Sito|2013|pp=207–208}}{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=204}} Examples include ''[[The Polar Express (film)|Polar Express]]'' (2004, US), ''[[Beowulf (2007 film)|Beowulf]]'' (2007, US), ''[[A Christmas Carol (2009 film)|A Christmas Carol]]'' (2009, US), ''[[The Adventures of Tintin (film)|The Adventures of Tintin]]'' (2011, US) ''[[Kochadaiiyaan|kochadiiyan]]'' (2014, India)
* '''[[Computer animation|Photo-realistic animation]]''' is used primarily for animation that attempts to resemble real life, using advanced rendering that mimics in detail skin, plants, water, fire, clouds, etc.{{sfn|Parent|2007|p=19}} Examples include ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]'' (2009, US), ''[[How to Train Your Dragon (film)|How to Train Your Dragon]]'' (2010, US)

=== Mechanical animation ===
* '''[[Animatronics]]''' is the use of [[mechatronics]] to create machines that seem animate rather than robotic.
** '''[[Audio-Animatronics|Audio-Animatronics and Autonomatronics]]''' is a form of [[robotics]] animation, combined with 3-D animation, created by [[Walt Disney Imagineering]] for shows and attractions at Disney theme parks move and make noise (generally a recorded speech or song).{{sfn|Pilling|1997|p=249}} They are fixed to whatever supports them. They can sit and stand, and they cannot walk. An Audio-Animatron is different from an [[android (robot)|android]]-type robot in that it uses prerecorded movements and sounds, rather than responding to external stimuli. In 2009, Disney created an interactive version of the technology called Autonomatronics.{{sfn|O'Keefe|2014}}
** '''Linear Animation Generator''' is a form of animation by using static picture frames installed in a tunnel or a shaft. The animation illusion is created by putting the viewer in a linear motion, parallel to the installed picture frames.{{sfn|Parent|2007|pages=22–23}} The concept and the technical solution were invented in 2007 by Mihai Girlovan in Romania.
* '''[[Chuckimation]]''' is a type of animation created by the makers of the television series ''[[Action League Now!]]'' in which characters/props are thrown, or chucked from off camera or wiggled around to simulate talking by unseen hands.{{sfn|Kenyon|1998}}
* The '''[[Magic lantern#Moving images|magic lantern]]''' used mechanical slides to project moving images, probably since Christiaan Huygens invented this early image projector in 1659.

* '''[[Drawn on film animation]]''': a technique where footage is produced by creating the images directly on [[film stock]], for example by [[Norman McLaren]],{{sfn|Faber|Walters|2004|p=1979}} [[Len Lye]] and [[Stan Brakhage]].
* '''[[Paint-on-glass animation]]''': a technique for making animated films by manipulating slow drying [[oil paint]]s on sheets of glass,{{sfn|Pilling|1997|p=222}} for example by [[Aleksandr Petrov (animator)|Aleksandr Petrov]].
* '''Erasure animation''': a technique using traditional 2D media, photographed over time as the artist manipulates the image. For example, [[William Kentridge]] is famous for his [[charcoal]] erasure films,{{sfn|Carbone|2010}} and [[Piotr Dumała]] for his auteur technique of animating scratches on plaster.
* '''[[Pinscreen animation]]''': makes use of a screen filled with movable pins that can be moved in or out by pressing an object onto the screen.{{sfn|Neupert|2011}} The screen is lit from the side so that the pins cast shadows. The technique has been used to create animated films with a range of textural effects difficult to achieve with traditional cel animation.{{sfn|Pilling|1997|p=204}}
* '''[[Sand animation]]''': sand is moved around on a back- or front-lighted piece of glass to create each frame for an animated film.{{sfn|Brown|2003|p=7}} This creates an interesting effect when animated because of the [[light]] [[Contrast (vision)|contrast]].{{sfn|Furniss|1998|pp=30–33}}
* '''[[Flip book]]''': a flip book (sometimes, especially in British English, called a flick book) is a book with a series of pictures that vary gradually from one page to the next, so that when the pages are turned rapidly, the pictures appear to animate by simulating motion or some other change.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=22–24}}{{sfn|Solomon|1989|pp=8–10}} Flip books are often illustrated books for children,{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=xiv}} they also be geared towards adults and employ a series of photographs rather than drawings. Flip books are not always separate books, they appear as an added feature in ordinary books or magazines, often in the page corners.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=22–24}} Software packages and websites are also available that convert digital video files into custom-made flip books.{{sfn|White|2006|p=203}}

== Animator ==
{{Main|Animator}}
An animator is an artist who creates a visual sequence (or audio-visual if added sound) of multiple sequential images that generate the illusion of movement, that is, an animation. Animations are currently in many areas of technology and video, such as [[Film|cinema]], [[television]], [[video game]]s or the [[internet]]. Generally, these works require the collaboration of several animators. The methods to create these images depend on the animator and style that one wants to achieve (with images generated by computer, manually ...).

Animators can be divided into animators of '''characters''' (artists who are specialized in the movements, dialogue and acting of the characters) and animators of '''special effects''' (for example vehicles, machinery or natural phenomena such as water, snow, rain).

==Production==

The creation of non-trivial animation works (i.e., longer than a few seconds) has developed as a form of [[filmmaking]], with certain unique aspects.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=117}} Traits common to both live-action and animated [[Feature film|feature-length films]] are labor-intensity and high production costs.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=274}}

The most important difference is that once a film is in the production phase, the [[marginal cost]] of one more shot is higher for animated films than live-action films.{{sfn|White|2006|p=151}} It is relatively easy for a director to ask for one more [[take]] during [[principal photography]] of a live-action film, but every take on an animated film must be manually rendered by animators (although the task of rendering slightly different takes has been made less tedious by modern computer animation).{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=339}} It is pointless for a studio to pay the salaries of dozens of animators to spend weeks creating a visually dazzling five-minute scene if that scene fails to effectively advance the plot of the film.{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=55}} Thus, animation studios starting with Disney began the practice in the 1930s of maintaining story departments where [[storyboard artist]]s develop every single scene through [[storyboard]]s, then handing the film over to the animators only after the production team is satisfied that all the scenes make sense as a whole. {{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=120}} While live-action films are now also storyboarded, they enjoy more latitude to depart from storyboards (i.e., real-time improvisation).{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=100–101}}

Another problem unique to animation is the requirement to maintain a film's consistency from start to finish, even as films have grown longer and teams have grown larger.  Animators, like all artists, necessarily have individual styles, but must subordinate their individuality in a consistent way to whatever style is employed on a particular film.{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=94}} Since the early 1980s, teams of about 500 to 600 people, of whom 50 to 70 are animators, typically have created feature-length animated films.  It is relatively easy for two or three artists to match their styles; synchronizing those of dozens of artists is more difficult.{{sfn|Beck|2004|p=37}}

This problem is usually solved by having a separate group of visual development artists develop an overall look and palette for each film before animation begins. Character designers on the visual development team draw [[model sheet]]s to show how each character should look like with different facial expressions, posed in different positions, and viewed from different angles.{{sfn|Williams|2001|p=34}}{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=146}} On traditionally animated projects, [[maquette]]s were often sculpted to further help the animators see how characters would look from different angles.{{sfn|Williams|2001|pp=52–57}}{{sfn|Williams|2001|p=34}}

Unlike live-action films, animated films were traditionally developed beyond the synopsis stage through the storyboard format; the storyboard artists would then receive credit for writing the film.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=99–100}} In the early 1960s, animation studios began hiring professional screenwriters to write screenplays (while also continuing to use story departments) and screenplays had become commonplace for animated films by the late 1980s.

==Criticism==
Criticism of animation has been common in media and cinema since its inception. With its popularity, a large amount of criticism has arisen, especially animated feature-length films.{{sfn|Amidi|2011}} Many concerns of cultural representation, psychological effects on children have been brought up around the animation industry, which has remained rather politically unchanged and stagnant since its inception into mainstream culture.{{sfn|Nagel|2008}}

==Awards==
As with any other form of media, animation too has instituted awards for excellence in the field. The original awards for animation were presented by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] for animated shorts from the year 1932, during the 5th [[Academy Awards]] function. The first winner of the [[5th Academy Awards|Academy Award]] was the short ''[[Flowers and Trees]]'',{{sfn|Walt Disney Family Museum|2013}} a production by [[Walt Disney Productions]].{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=37}}{{sfn|Shaffer|2010|page=211}} The Academy Award for a feature-length animated motion picture was only instituted for the year 2001, and awarded during the 74th Academy Awards in 2002. It was won by the film ''[[Shrek]]'', produced by [[DreamWorks]] and [[Pacific Data Images]].{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|pp=84–85}} [[Disney]]/[[Pixar]] have produced the most films either to win or be nominated for the award. The list of both awards can be obtained here:
*[[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]]
*[[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]]

Several other countries have instituted an award for best animated feature film as part of their national film awards: [[Africa Movie Academy Award for Best Animation]] (since 2008), [[BAFTA Award for Best Animated Film]] (since 2006), [[César Award for Best Animated Film]] (since 2011), [[Golden Rooster Award for Best Animation]] (since 1981), [[Goya Award for Best Animated Film]] (since 1989), [[Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year]] (since 2007), [[National Film Award for Best Animated Film]] (since 2006). Also since 2007, the [[Asia Pacific Screen Award for Best Animated Feature Film]] has been awarded at the [[Asia Pacific Screen Awards]]. Since 2009, the [[European Film Awards]] have awarded the [[European Film Award for Best Animated Film]].
 
The [[Annie Award]] is another award presented for excellence in the field of animation. Unlike the Academy Awards, the Annie Awards are only received for achievements in the field of animation and not for any other field of technical and artistic endeavor. They were re-organized in 1992 to create a new field for Best Animated feature. The 1990s winners were dominated by Walt Disney, however, newer studios, led by Pixar &amp; DreamWorks, have now begun to consistently vie for this award. The list of awardees is as follows: 
*[[Annie Award for Best Animated Feature]]
*[[Annie Award for Best Animated Short Subject]]
*[[Annie Award for Best Animated Television Production]]

'''Bicycle and motorcycle dynamics''' is the [[science]] of the [[Motion (physics)|motion]] of [[bicycle]]s and [[motorcycle]]s and their components, due to the [[force]]s acting on them. [[Multibody dynamics|Dynamics]] falls under a branch of [[physics]] known as [[classical mechanics]]. Bike motions of interest include [[Mechanical equilibrium|balancing]], [[countersteering|steering]], [[brake|braking]], [[Acceleration|accelerating]], [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] activation, and [[vibration]]. The study of these motions began in the late 19th century and continues today.&lt;ref name="KMPRS"&gt;{{cite journal

Bicycles and motorcycles are both [[single-track vehicle]]s and so their motions have many fundamental attributes in common and are fundamentally different from and more difficult to study than other wheeled vehicles such as [[Dicycle (vehicle)|dicycles]], [[tricycle]]s, and [[quadracycle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[Experiment]]ation and [[mathematical model|mathematical analysis]] have shown that a bike stays upright when it is steered to keep its [[center of mass]] over its wheels. This steering is usually supplied by a rider, or in certain circumstances, by the bike itself. Several factors, including geometry, mass distribution, and gyroscopic effect all contribute in varying degrees to this self-stability, but long-standing hypotheses and claims that any single effect, such as [[gyroscopic]] or [[Bicycle and motorcycle geometry#Trail|trail]], is solely responsible for the stabilizing force have been discredited.&lt;ref name="KMPRS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="klein"&gt;{{cite web

While remaining upright may be the primary goal of beginning riders, a bike must lean in order to maintain balance in a turn: the higher the [[speed]] or smaller the turn [[radius]], the more lean is required. This balances the roll torque about the wheel contact patches generated by [[centrifugal force]] due to the turn with that of the [[gravitational force]]. This lean is usually produced by a momentary steering in the opposite direction, called [[countersteering]]. Countersteering skill is usually acquired by [[motor learning]] and executed via [[procedural memory]] rather than by conscious thought. Unlike other wheeled vehicles, the primary [[Control theory|control]] input on bikes is steering [[torque]], not position.&lt;ref name="Sharp"&gt;{{cite journal

Although longitudinally stable when stationary, bikes often have a high enough center of mass and a short enough wheelbase to [[wheelie|lift a wheel off the ground]] under sufficient acceleration or deceleration. When braking, depending on the location of the combined center of mass of the bike and rider with respect to the point where the front wheel contacts the ground, bikes can either skid the front wheel or flip the bike and rider over the front wheel. A similar situation is possible while accelerating, but with respect to the rear wheel.&lt;ref name="Cossalter"&gt;{{cite book

==History==
[[File:Ravensburg Rutenfest 2005 Festzug Draisine.jpg|right|thumb|[[Dandy horse|Draisine]].]]
The history of the study of bike dynamics is nearly as old as the bicycle itself. It includes contributions from famous scientists such as [[William John Macquorn Rankine|Rankine]], [[Paul Émile Appell|Appell]], and [[Francis John Welsh Whipple|Whipple]].&lt;ref name="MPRS"/&gt; In the early 19th century [[Karl Drais|Karl von Drais]], credited with inventing the two-wheeled vehicle variously called the [[laufmaschine]], [[velocipede]], [[draisine]], and [[dandy horse]], showed that a rider could balance his device by steering the front wheel.&lt;ref name="MPRS"/&gt; In 1869, Rankine published an article in ''The Engineer'' repeating von Drais's assertion that balance is maintained by steering in the direction of a lean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In 1897, the [[French Academy of Sciences]] made understanding bicycle dynamics the goal of its Prix Fourneyron competition. Thus, by the end of the 19th century, [[:fr:Carlo Bourlet|Carlo Bourlet]], [[Emmanuel Carvallo]], and Francis Whipple had showed with [[Rigid body kinetics|rigid-body dynamics]] that some [[safety bicycle]]s could actually balance themselves if moving at the right speed.&lt;ref name="MPRS"/&gt; Bourlet won the Prix Fourneyron, and Whipple won the [[Cambridge University]] [[Smith Prize]].&lt;ref name=Sharp1/&gt; It is not clear to whom should go the credit for tilting the steering axis from the vertical which helps make this possible.&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{cite book

In the early 1970s, Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory (CAL, later [[Calspan|Calspan Corporation]] in Buffalo, NY USA) was sponsored by the Schwinn Bicycle Company and others to study and simulate bicycle and motorcycle dynamics. Portions of this work have now been released to the public and scans of over 30 detailed reports have been posted at this [http://bicycle.tudelft.nl/schwab/Bicycle/calspan TU Delft Bicycle Dynamics site].

In 2007, Meijaard, et al., published the canonical linearized [[Equation of motion|equations of motion]], in the ''[[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]]'', along with verification by two different methods.&lt;ref name="MPRS"/&gt; These equations assumed the tires to roll without slip, that is to say, to go where they point, and the rider to be rigidly attached to the rear frame of the bicycle.

In 2011, Kooijman, et al., published an article in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' showing that neither gyroscopic effects nor so-called caster effects due to trail are necessary for a bike to balance itself.&lt;ref name="KMPRS"/&gt; They designed a [[two-mass-skate bicycle]] that the [[#Equations of motion|equations of motion]] predict is [[#Self-stability|self-stable]] even with [[#Trail|negative trail]], the front wheel contacts the ground in front of the steering axis, and with counter-rotating wheels to cancel any [[#Gyroscopic effects|gyroscopic effects]]. Then they constructed a physical model to validate that prediction. This may require some of the details provided below about steering geometry or stability to be re-evaluated.

[[File:CB steering spring 63 &amp; Columbus jeh.JPG|thumb|Spring between front fork and rear frame]]

==Forces==
If the bike and rider are considered to be a single system, the forces that act on that system and its components can be roughly divided into two groups: internal and external. The external forces are due to gravity, inertia, contact with the ground, and contact with the atmosphere. The internal forces are caused by the rider and by interaction between components.

===External forces===
As with all masses, [[Gravitation|gravity]] pulls the rider and all the bike components toward the earth. At each tire [[contact patch]] there are [[Reaction (physics)|ground reaction]] forces with both horizontal and vertical components. The vertical components mostly counteract the force of gravity, but also vary with braking and accelerating. For details, see the section on ''[[#Longitudinal dynamics|longitudinal stability]]'' below. The horizontal components, due to [[friction]] between the wheels and the ground, including [[rolling resistance]], are in response to [[Vehicle propulsion|propulsive]] forces, braking forces, and turning forces. [[Full aerodynamic force|Aerodynamic]] forces due to the atmosphere are mostly in the form of [[Drag (physics)|drag]], but can also be from [[crosswind]]s. At normal bicycling speeds on level ground, aerodynamic drag is the largest force resisting forward motion.&lt;ref name="whitt"&gt;{{cite book

| pages = 188, 198–233}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|188}} At faster speed, aerodynamic drag becomes overwhelmingly the largest force resisting forward motion.

Turning forces are generated during maneuvers for balancing in addition to just changing direction of travel. These may be interpreted as [[Centrifugal force|centrifugal]] forces in the accelerating [[Frame of reference|reference frame]] of the bike and rider; or simply as [[inertia]] in a stationary, [[Inertial frame of reference|inertial reference frame]] and not forces at all. ''[[Gyroscope#Properties|Gyroscopic]]'' forces acting on rotating parts such as wheels, engine, transmission, etc., are also due to the inertia of those rotating parts. They are discussed further in the section on [[#Gyroscopic effects|gyroscopic effects]] below.

===Internal forces===
Internal forces, those between components of the bike and rider system, are mostly caused by the rider or by friction. In addition to pedaling, the rider can apply [[torque]]s between the steering mechanism (front fork, handlebars, front wheel, etc.) and rear frame, and between the rider and the rear frame. [[Friction]] exists between any parts that move against each other: in the [[Powertrain|drive train]], between the steering mechanism and the rear frame, etc. In addition to [[Bicycle brake|brakes]], which create friction between rotating wheels and non-rotating frame parts, many bikes have front and rear [[Bicycle suspension|suspensions]]. Some motorcycles and bicycles have a [[steering damper]] to dissipate undesirable kinetic energy,&lt;ref name="LSE"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.dirtragmag.com/reviews/hopey-steering-damper| title = Hopey Steering Damper| date = October 1, 2000| publisher = Dirt Rag Magazine| quote = 140 gram, fully hydraulic, bicycle steering damper| accessdate = 2013-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some bicycles have a spring connecting the front fork to the frame to provide a progressive torque that tends to steer the bicycle straight ahead. On bikes with rear suspensions, [[Feedback#Mechanical engineering|feedback]] between the drive train and the suspension is an issue designers attempt to handle with various [[Linkage (mechanical)|linkage]] configurations and [[Dashpot|dampers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Motions==
Motions of a bike can be roughly grouped into those out of the central plane of symmetry: lateral; and those in the central plane of symmetry: longitudinal or vertical. Lateral motions include balancing, leaning, steering, and turning. Motions in the central plane of symmetry include rolling forward, of course, but also [[stoppie]]s, [[wheelie]]s, [[Suspension (motorcycle)#Brake dive|brake diving]], and most suspension activation. Motions in these two groups are [[linear]]ly decoupled, that is they do not interact with each other to the [[Orders of approximation|first order]].&lt;ref name="MPRS"/&gt; An uncontrolled bike is laterally unstable when stationary and can be laterally self-stable when moving under the right conditions or when controlled by a rider. Conversely, a bike is longitudinally stable when stationary and can be longitudinally unstable when undergoing sufficient acceleration or deceleration.

==Lateral dynamics==
Of the two, lateral dynamics has proven to be the more complicated, requiring [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]], multibody dynamic analysis with at least two [[generalized coordinates]] to analyze. At a minimum, two coupled, second-order differential equations are required to capture the principal motions.&lt;ref name="MPRS"/&gt; Exact solutions are not possible, and [[Numerical ordinary differential equations|numerical methods]] must be used instead.&lt;ref name="MPRS"/&gt; Competing theories of how bikes balance can still be found in print and online. On the other hand, as shown in later sections, much longitudinal dynamic analysis can be accomplished simply with planar [[Kinetics (physics)|kinetics]] and just one coordinate.

===Balance===
[[File:Bicycle balancing.JPG|thumb|upright|Balancing a bicycle by keeping the wheels under the center of mass]]
When discussing bike balance, it is necessary to distinguish carefully between "[[Mechanical equilibrium#Stability|stability]]", "[[#self-stability|self-stability]]", and "[[controllability]]". Recent research suggests that "rider-controlled stability of bicycles is indeed related to their self-stability."&lt;ref name="KMPRS"/&gt;

A bike remains upright when it is steered so that the ground reaction forces exactly balance all the other internal and external forces it experiences, such as gravitational if leaning, inertial or centrifugal if in a turn, gyroscopic if being steered, and aerodynamic if in a crosswind.&lt;ref name="whitt"/&gt;
Steering may be supplied by a rider or, under certain circumstances, by the bike itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Tires, suspension, steering damping, and frame flex can also influence it, especially in motorcycles.

Even when staying relatively motionless, a rider can balance a bike by the same principle. While performing a [[track stand]], the rider can keep the line between the two contact patches under the combined center of mass by steering the front wheel to one side or the other and then moving forward and backward slightly to move the front contact patch from side to side as necessary. Forward motion can be generated simply by pedaling. Backwards motion can be generated the same way on a [[fixed-gear bicycle]]. Otherwise, the rider can take advantage of an opportune slope of the pavement or lurch the upper body backwards while the brakes are momentarily engaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

If the steering of a bike is locked, it becomes virtually impossible to balance while riding. On the other hand, if the gyroscopic effect of rotating bike wheels is cancelled by adding counter-rotating wheels, it is still easy to balance while riding.&lt;ref name="klein"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jones"/&gt; One other way that a bike can be balanced, with or without locked steering, is by applying appropriate torques between the bike and rider similar to the way a gymnast can swing up from hanging straight down on [[uneven parallel bars]], a person can start swinging on a [[Swing (seat)|swing]] from rest by pumping their legs, or a [[double inverted pendulum]] can be controlled with an actuator only at the elbow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Forward speed====
The rider applies torque to the handlebars in order to turn the front wheel and so to control lean and maintain balance. At high speeds, small steering angles quickly move the ground contact points laterally; at low speeds, larger steering angles are required to achieve the same results in the same amount of time. Because of this, it is usually easier to maintain balance at high speeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; As self-stability typically occurs at speeds above a certain threshold, going faster increases the chances that a bike is contributing to its own stability.

====Center of mass location====
The farther forward (closer to front wheel) the center of mass of the combined bike and rider, the less the front wheel has to move laterally in order to maintain balance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A bike is also an example of an [[Inverted pendulum#Stationary pivot point|inverted pendulum]]. Just as a broomstick is more easily balanced in the hand than a pencil, a tall bike (with a high center of mass) can be easier to balance when ridden than a low one because the tall bike's lean rate (rate at which its angle of lean increases as it begins to fall over) will be slower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a rider can have the opposite impression of a bike when it is stationary. A top-heavy bike can require more effort to keep upright, when stopped in traffic for example, than a bike which is just as tall but with a lower center of mass. This is an example of a vertical [[second-class lever]]. A small force at the end of the lever, the seat or handlebars at the top of the bike, more easily moves a large mass if the mass is closer to the fulcrum, where the tires touch the ground. This is why [[Bicycle touring|touring]] cyclists are advised to carry loads low on a bike, and [[Panniers#Bicycle panniers|panniers]] hang down on either side of front and rear [[Luggage carrier|racks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Trail====
[[File:Bicycle dimensions.svg|thumb|350px|Bicycle [[Caster angle|head angle]], [[Rake and trail|rake, and trail]]]]

A factor that influences how easy or difficult a bike will be to ride is '''[[Bicycle and motorcycle geometry#Trail|trail]]''', the distance that the front wheel ground contact point trails behind the steering axis ground contact point. The steering axis is the axis about which the entire steering mechanism (fork, handlebars, front wheel, etc.) pivots. In traditional bike designs, with a steering axis tilted back from the vertical, positive trail tends to steer the front wheel into the direction of a lean, independent of forward speed.&lt;ref name="whitt" /&gt; This can be simulated by pushing a stationary bike to one side. The front wheel will usually also steer to that side. In a lean, gravity provides this force. The dynamics of a moving bike are more complicated, however, and other factors can contribute to or detract from this effect.&lt;ref name="KMPRS"/&gt;

Trail is a function of head angle, fork offset or rake, and wheel size. Their relationship can be described by this formula:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title = Steering Geometry: What is Trail?

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\text{Trail} = \frac{(R_w \cos(A_h) - O_f)}{\sin(A_h)}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;R_w&lt;/math&gt; is wheel radius, &lt;math&gt;A_h&lt;/math&gt; is the head angle measured clock-wise from the horizontal and &lt;math&gt;O_f&lt;/math&gt; is the fork offset or rake. Trail can be increased by increasing the wheel size, decreasing the head angle, or decreasing the fork rake.

The more trail a traditional bike has, the more stable it feels,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Bikes with negative trail (where the contact patch is in front of where the steering axis intersects the ground), while still  rideable, are reported to feel very unstable. Normally, road racing bicycles have more trail than touring bikes but less than mountain bikes.  Mountain bikes are designed with reduced head angles than road bikes to improve stability for descents, and therefore have greater trail.  Touring bikes are built with small trail to allow the rider to control a bike weighed down with baggage.  As a consequence, an unloaded touring bike can feel unstable.  In bicycles, [[bicycle fork|fork]] rake, often a curve in the fork blades forward of the steering axis, is used to diminish trail.&lt;ref name="zinn"&gt;{{cite news

A small survey by Whitt and Wilson&lt;ref name="whitt" /&gt; found:
*[[touring bicycle]]s with head angles between 72° and 73° and trail between 43&amp;nbsp;mm and 60&amp;nbsp;mm
*[[racing bicycle]]s with head angles between 73° and 74° and trail between 28&amp;nbsp;mm and 45&amp;nbsp;mm
*[[track bicycle]]s with head angles of 75° and trail between 23.5&amp;nbsp;mm and 37&amp;nbsp;mm.

However, these ranges are not hard and fast. For example, [[LeMond Racing Cycles]] offers &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

both with forks that have 45&amp;nbsp;mm of offset or rake and the same size wheels:
*a 2006 Tete de Course, designed for road racing, with a head angle that varies from 71¼° to 74°, depending on frame size, and thus trail that varies from 51.5&amp;nbsp;mm to 69&amp;nbsp;mm.
*a 2007 Filmore, designed for the track, with a head angle that varies from 72½° to 74°, depending on frame size, and thus trail that varies from 51.5&amp;nbsp;mm to 61&amp;nbsp;mm.

The amount of trail a particular bike has may vary with time for several reasons. On bikes with front suspension, especially telescopic forks, compressing the front suspension, due to heavy braking for example, can steepen the steering axis angle and reduce trail. Trail also varies with lean angle, and steering angle, usually decreasing from a maximum when the bike is straight upright and steered straight ahead.&lt;ref name="FoaleBook"&gt;{{cite book

A measurement similar to trail, called either '''[[mechanical trail]]''', '''normal trail''', or '''true trail''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the ''perpendicular'' distance from the steering axis to the centroid of the front wheel contact patch.

====Wheelbase====
A factor that influences the directional stability of a bike is '''[[Bicycle and motorcycle geometry#Wheelbase|wheelbase]]''', the horizontal distance between the ground contact points of the front and rear wheels. For a given displacement of the front wheel, due to some disturbance, the angle of the resulting path from the original is inversely proportional to wheelbase.&lt;ref name="Cossalter"/&gt; Also, the radius of curvature for a given steer angle and lean angle is proportional to the wheelbase.&lt;ref name="Cossalter"/&gt; Finally, the wheelbase increases when the bike is leaned and steered. In the extreme, when the lean angle is 90°, and the bike is steered in the direction of that lean, the wheelbase is increased by the radius of the front and rear wheels.&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt;

====Steering mechanism mass distribution====
Another factor that can also contribute to the self-stability of traditional bike designs is the distribution of mass in the steering mechanism, which includes the front wheel, the fork, and the handlebar. If the center of mass for the steering mechanism is in front of the steering axis, then the pull of gravity will also cause the front wheel to steer in the direction of a lean. This can be seen by leaning a stationary bike to one side. The front wheel will usually also steer to that side independent of any interaction with the ground.&lt;ref name="hand"&gt;{{cite web

====Gyroscopic effects====
[[File:Gyroscope wheel-text.png|thumb|200px|right|Gyroscopic effect on front wheel of a bike. Applying a torque (in green) about the lean axis results in a reaction torque (in blue) about the steer axis.]]

The role of the gyroscopic effect in most bike designs is to help steer the front wheel into the direction of a lean. This phenomenon is called ''[[precession]]'' and the rate at which an object precesses is inversely proportional to its rate of spin. The slower a front wheel spins, the faster it will precess when the bike leans, and vice versa.&lt;ref name="fajans"&gt;{{cite journal

The rear wheel is prevented from precessing as the front wheel does by friction of the tires on the ground, and so continues to lean as though it were not spinning at all. Hence gyroscopic forces do not provide any resistance to tipping.&lt;ref name = "McGill"&gt;{{cite book

At low forward speeds, the precession of the front wheel is too quick, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to oversteer, start to lean the other way and eventually oscillate and fall over. At high forward speeds, the precession is usually too slow, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to understeer and eventually fall over without ever having reached the upright position.&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt; This instability is very slow, on the order of seconds, and is easy for most riders to counteract. Thus a fast bike may feel stable even though it is actually not self-stable and would fall over if it were uncontrolled.

Another contribution of gyroscopic effects is a roll [[Moment (physics)|moment]] generated by the front wheel during countersteering. For example, steering left causes a moment to the right. The moment is small compared to the moment generated by the out-tracking front wheel, but begins as soon as the rider applies torque to the handlebars and so can be helpful in [[motorcycle racing]].&lt;ref name = "Cossalter"/&gt; For more detail, see the section [[#Countersteering|countersteering]], below, and the [[countersteering]] article.

====Self-stability====
Between the two unstable regimes mentioned in the previous section, and influenced by all the factors described above that contribute to balance (trail, mass distribution, gyroscopic effects, etc.), there may be a range of forward speeds for a given bike design at which these effects steer an uncontrolled bike upright.&lt;ref name="MPRS"/&gt; It has been proven that neither gyroscopic effects nor positive trail are sufficient by themselves or necessary for self-stability, although they certainly can enhance hands-free control.&lt;ref name="KMPRS"/&gt;

However, even without self-stability a bike may be ridden by steering it to keep it over its wheels.&lt;ref name="jones" /&gt; Note that the effects mentioned above that would combine to produce self-stability may be overwhelmed by additional factors such as [[headset (bicycle part)|headset]] friction and stiff [[Bowden cable|control cables]].&lt;ref name="whitt" /&gt; This [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zt7J0dly70M video] shows a riderless bicycle exhibiting self-stability.

====Longitudinal acceleration====
Longitudinal acceleration has been shown to have a large and complex effect on lateral dynamics. In one study, positive acceleration eliminates self stability, and negative acceleration (deceleration) changes the speeds of self stability.&lt;ref name=Sharp1/&gt;

===Turning===
[[File:Claudio Corti Silverstone 2013.jpg|thumb|A [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing|Grand Prix]] motorcyclist leaning in a turn]]
[[File:BikeLeanForces3.PNG|thumb|The forces, both physical and [[Inertial force|inertial]], acting on a leaning bike in the rotating reference frame of a turn where ''N'' is the normal force, ''F&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' is friction, ''m'' is mass, ''r'' is turn radius, ''v'' is forward speed, and ''g'' is the acceleration of gravity.]]
[[File:Bike lean angle vs forward speed.PNG|thumb|Graph of bike lean angle vs forward speed, assuming unlimited friction between tires and ground.]]
[[File:Cycling with no hands.JPG|thumb|upright|Cyclist riding with no hands on the handlebars.]]

In order for a bike to turn, that is, change its direction of forward travel, the front wheel must aim approximately in the desired direction, as with any front-wheel steered vehicle. Friction between the wheels and the ground then generates the [[Centripetal acceleration#Tangential and centripetal acceleration|centripetal acceleration]] necessary to alter the course from straight ahead as a combination of [[cornering force]] and [[camber thrust]]. The radius of the turn of an upright (not leaning) bike can be roughly approximated, for [[Small-angle approximation|small steering angles]], by:
:&lt;math&gt;r = \frac{w}{\delta \cos \left (\phi \right )}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;r\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the approximate radius, &lt;math&gt;w\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Bicycle and motorcycle geometry#Wheelbase|wheelbase]], &lt;math&gt;\delta\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the steer angle, and &lt;math&gt;\phi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Bicycle and motorcycle geometry#Steering axis angle|caster angle]] of the steering axis.&lt;ref name = "Cossalter"/&gt;

====Leaning====

However, unlike other wheeled vehicles, bikes must also lean during a turn to balance the relevant forces: gravitational, inertial, frictional, and ground support. The angle of lean,&amp;nbsp;''θ'', can easily be calculated using the laws of [[circular motion]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\theta = \arctan \left (\frac{v^2}{gr}\right )&lt;/math&gt;

where ''v'' is the forward speed, ''r'' is the radius of the turn and ''g'' is the acceleration of [[gravity]].&lt;ref name="fajans" /&gt; This is in the idealized case. A slight increase in the lean angle may be required on motorcycles to compensate for the width of modern tires at the same forward speed and turn radius.&lt;ref name="FoaleBook"/&gt;

It can also be seen however that this simple 2-dimensional model, essentially an inverted pendulum on a [[Phonograph#Turntable technology|turntable]], predicts that the steady-state turn is unstable. If the bike is displaced slightly downwards from its equilibrium lean angle, the torque of gravity increases, that of centrifugal force decreases and the displacement gets amplified. A more-sophisticated model that allows a wheel to steer, adjust the path, and counter the torque of gravity, is necessary to capture the self-stability observed in real bikes.

For example, a bike in a 10&amp;nbsp;m (33&amp;nbsp;ft) radius steady-state turn at 10&amp;nbsp;m/s (36&amp;nbsp;km/h, 22&amp;nbsp;mph) must be at an angle of 45.6°. A rider can lean with respect to the bike in order to keep either the torso or the bike more or less upright if desired. The angle that matters is the one between the horizontal plane and the plane defined by the tire contacts and the location of the center of mass of bike and rider.

This lean of the bike decreases the actual radius of the turn proportionally to the cosine of the lean angle. The resulting radius can be roughly approximated (within 2% of exact value) by:

:&lt;math&gt;r = \frac{w\cos \left (\theta \right )}{\delta \cos \left (\phi \right )}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''r'' is the approximate radius, ''w'' is the wheelbase, ''θ'' is the lean angle, ''δ'' is the steer angle, and ''φ'' is the caster angle of the steering axis.&lt;ref name="Cossalter"/&gt;  As a bike leans, the tires' contact patches move farther to the side causing wear. The portions at either edge of a motorcycle tire that remain unworn by leaning into turns is sometimes referred to as {{linktext|chicken strips}}.

The finite width of the tires alters the actual lean angle of the rear frame from the ideal lean angle described above. The actual lean angle between the frame and the vertical must increase with tire width and decrease with center of mass height. Bikes with fat tires and low center of mass must lean more than bikes with skinnier tires or higher centers of mass to negotiate the same turn at the same speed.&lt;ref name = "Cossalter"/&gt;

The increase in lean angle due to a tire thickness of 2''t'' can be calculated as

:&lt;math&gt;\arcsin \left ( t \frac {\sin(\phi)} {h-t} \right ) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''φ'' is the ideal lean angle, and ''h'' is the height of the center of mass.&lt;ref name = "Cossalter"/&gt; For example, a motorcycle with a 12&amp;nbsp;inch wide rear tire will have ''t''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6&amp;nbsp;inches. If the combined bike and rider center of mass is at a height of 26&amp;nbsp;inches, then a 25° lean must be increased by 7.28°: a nearly 30% increase. If the tires are only 6&amp;nbsp;inches wide, then the lean angle increase is only 3.16°, just under half.

It has been shown that the couple created by gravity and the ground reaction forces is necessary for a bicycle to turn at all. On a custom built bicycle with spring-loaded outriggers that exactly cancel this couple, so that the bicycle and rider may assume any lean angle when traveling in a straight line, riders find it impossible to make a turn. As soon as the wheels deviate from a straight path, the bicycle and rider begin to lean in the opposite direction, and the only way to right them is to steer back onto the straight path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Countersteering====
{{Main|Countersteering}}
In order to initiate a turn and the necessary lean in the direction of that turn, a bike must momentarily steer in the opposite direction. This is often referred to as countersteering. With the front wheel now at a finite angle to the direction of motion, a lateral force is developed at the contact patch of the tire. This force creates a torque around the longitudinal (roll) axis of the bike, and this torque causes the bike to lean away from the initially steered direction and toward the direction of the desired turn. Where there is no external influence, such as an opportune side wind to create the force necessary to lean the bike, countersteering is necessary to initiate a rapid turn.&lt;ref name="fajans" /&gt;

While the initial steer torque and steer angle are both opposite the desired turn direction, this may not be the case to maintain a steady-state turn. The sustained steer angle is usually in the same direction as the turn, but may remain opposite to the direction of the turn, especially at high speeds.&lt;ref name="steady_turn"&gt;{{cite journal

To exit the turn, the bike must again countersteer, momentarily steering more into the turn in order to decrease the radius, thus increasing inertial forces, and thereby decreasing the angle of lean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Steady-state turning====
Once a turn is established, the torque that must be applied to the steering mechanism in order to maintain a constant radius at a constant forward speed depends on the forward speed and the geometry and mass distribution of the bike.&lt;ref name="Wilson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="steer_decomp"/&gt; At speeds below the capsize speed, described below in the section on ''[[#Eigenvalues|Eigenvalues]]'' and also called the ''inversion'' speed, the self-stability of the bike will cause it to tend to steer into the turn, righting itself and exiting the turn, unless a torque is applied in the opposite direction of the turn. At speeds above the capsize speed, the capsize instability will cause it to tend to steer out of the turn, increasing the lean, unless a torque is applied in the direction of the turn. At the capsize speed no input steering torque is necessary to maintain the steady-state turn.

====Steering angle====
Several effects influence the steering angle, the angle at which the front assembly is rotated about the steering axis, necessary to maintain a steady-state turn. Some of these are unique to single-track vehicles, while others are also experienced by automobiles. Some of these may be mentioned elsewhere in this article, and they are repeated here, though not necessarily in order of importance, so that they may be found in one place.

First, the actual kinematic steering angle, the angle projected onto the road plane to which the front assembly is rotated is a function of the steering angle and the steering axis angle:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta = \delta \cos \left (\phi \right )&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Delta\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the kinematic steering angle, &lt;math&gt;\delta\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the steering angle, and &lt;math&gt;\phi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the caster angle of the steering axis.&lt;ref name="Cossalter"/&gt;

Second, the lean of the bike decreases the actual radius of the turn proportionally to the cosine of the lean angle. The resulting radius can be roughly approximated (within 2% of exact value) by:
:&lt;math&gt;r = \frac{w\cos \left (\theta \right )}{\delta \cos \left (\phi \right )}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;r\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the approximate radius, &lt;math&gt;w\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the wheelbase, &lt;math&gt;\theta\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the lean angle, &lt;math&gt;\delta\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the steering angle, and &lt;math&gt;\phi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the caster angle of the steering axis.&lt;ref name="Cossalter"/&gt;

Third, because the front and rear tires can have different [[slip angle]]s due to weight distribution, tire properties, etc., bikes can experience [[understeer]] or [[oversteer]]. When understeering, the steering angle must be greater, and when oversteering, the steering angle must be less than it would be if the slip angles were equal to maintain a given turn radius.&lt;ref name="Cossalter"/&gt; Some authors even use the term ''[[Countersteering#Other uses|counter-steering]]'' to refer to the need on some bikes under some conditions to steer in the opposite direction of the turn (negative steering angle) to maintain control in response to significant rear wheel slippage.&lt;ref name="Cossalter"/&gt;

Fourth, [[camber thrust]] contributes to the [[centripetal force]] necessary to cause the bike to deviate from a straight path, along with [[cornering force]] due to the [[slip angle]], and can be the largest contributor.&lt;ref name="FoaleBook"/&gt; Camber thrust contributes to the ability of bikes to negotiate a turn with the same radius as automobiles but with a smaller steering angle.&lt;ref name="FoaleBook"/&gt; When a bike is steered and leaned in the same direction, the camber angle of the front tire is greater than that of the rear and so can generate more camber thrust, all else being equal.&lt;ref name="Cossalter"/&gt;

====No hands====
While countersteering is usually initiated by applying torque directly to the handlebars, on lighter vehicles such as bicycles, it can also be accomplished by shifting the rider’s weight. If the rider leans to the right relative to the bike, the bike leans to the left to conserve [[angular momentum]], and the combined center of mass remains nearly in the same vertical plane. This leftward lean of the bike, called '''counter lean''' by some authors,&lt;ref name="FoaleBook"/&gt; will cause it to steer to the left and initiate a right-hand turn as if the rider had countersteered to the left by applying a torque directly to the handlebars.&lt;ref name="fajans" /&gt; This technique may be complicated by additional factors such as headset friction and stiff control cables.

The combined center of mass does move slightly to the left when the rider leans to the right relative to the bike, and the bike leans to the left in response. The action, in space, would have the tires move right, but this is prevented by friction between the tires and the ground, and thus pushes the combined center of mass left. This is a small effect, however, as evidenced by the difficulty most people have in balancing a bike by this method alone.

====Gyroscopic effects====
As mentioned above in the section on balance, one effect of turning the front wheel is a roll [[Moment (physics)|moment]] caused by gyroscopic [[precession]]. The magnitude of this moment is proportional to the [[moment of inertia]] of the front wheel, its spin rate (forward motion), the rate that the rider turns the front wheel by applying a torque to the handlebars, and the [[Trigonometric functions#Sine, cosine and tangent|cosine]] of the angle between the steering axis and the vertical.&lt;ref name="Cossalter"/&gt;

For a sample motorcycle moving at 22&amp;nbsp;m/s (50&amp;nbsp;mph) that has a front wheel with a moment of inertia of 0.6&amp;nbsp;kg·m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, turning the front wheel one degree in half a second generates a roll moment of 3.5&amp;nbsp;N·m. In comparison, the lateral force on the front tire as it tracks out from under the motorcycle reaches a maximum of 50&amp;nbsp;N. This, acting on the 0.6&amp;nbsp;m (2&amp;nbsp;ft) height of the center of mass, generates a roll moment of 30&amp;nbsp;N·m.

While the moment from gyroscopic forces is only 12% of this, it can play a significant part because it begins to act as soon as the rider applies the torque, instead of building up more slowly as the wheel out-tracks. This can be especially helpful in [[motorcycle racing]].

====Two-wheel steering====
Because of theoretical benefits, such as a tighter turning radius at low speed, attempts have been made to construct motorcycles with two-wheel steering. One working prototype by Ian Drysdale in Australia is reported to "work very well."&lt;ref name = "FoaleSteering"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Issues in the design include whether to provide active control of the rear wheel or let it swing freely. In the case of active control, the control algorithm needs to decide between steering with or in the opposite direction of the front wheel, when, and how much. One implementation of two-wheel steering, the [[Sideways bike]], lets the rider control the steering of both wheels directly. Another, the [[Swing Bike]], had the second steering axis in front of the seat so that it could also be controlled by the handlebars.

Milton W. Raymond built a long low two-wheel steering bicycle, called "X-2", with various steering mechanisms to control the two wheels independently.  Steering motions included "balance", in which both wheels move together to steer the tire contacts under the center of mass; and "true circle", in which the wheels steer equally in opposite directions and thus steering the bicycle without substantially changing the lateral position of the tire contacts relative to the center of mass.  X-2 was also able to go "crabwise" with the wheels parallel but out of line with the frame, for instance with the front wheel near the roadway center line and rear wheel near the [[Curb (road)|curb]].  "Balance" steering allowed easy balancing despite long wheelbase and low center of mass, but no self-balancing ("no hands") configuration was discovered.  True circle, as expected, was essentially impossible to balance, as steering does not correct for misalignment of the tire patch and center of mass.  Crabwise cycling at angles tested up to about 45° did not show a tendency to fall over, even under braking.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}  X-2 is mentioned in passing in Whitt and Wilson's ''Bicycling Science'' 2nd edition.&lt;ref name="whitt"/&gt;

====Rear-wheel steering====
Because of the theoretical benefits, especially a simplified [[front-wheel drive]] mechanism, attempts have been made to construct a rideable rear-wheel steering bike. The [[Bendix Corporation|Bendix Company]] built a rear-wheel steering bicycle, and the U.S. Department of Transportation commissioned the construction of a rear-wheel steering motorcycle: both proved to be unrideable. Rainbow Trainers, Inc. in Alton, Illinois, offered US$5,000 to the first person "who can successfully ride the rear-steered bicycle, Rear Steered Bicycle I".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Laiterman at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, on a specially designed recumbent bike.&lt;ref name="whitt" /&gt; The difficulty is that turning left, accomplished by turning the rear wheel to the right, initially moves the center of mass to the right, and vice versa.

====Center steering====

[[File:Flevobike racer.jpg|thumb|[[Recumbent bicycle|Flevobike]] with center steering]]Between the extremes of bicycles with classical front-wheel steering and those with strictly rear-wheel steering is a class of bikes with a pivot point somewhere between the two, referred to as center-steering, and similar to [[Steering#Articulated steering|articulated steering]].

These designs, such as the Python Lowracer, a recumbent, usually have very lax head angles (40° to 65°) and positive or even negative trail. The builder of a bike with negative trail states that steering the bike from straight ahead forces the seat (and thus the rider) to rise slightly and this offsets the destabilizing effect of the negative trail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==== Reverse steering ====
Bicycles have been constructed, for investigation and demonstration purposes, with the steering reversed so that turning the handlebars to the left causes the front wheel to turn to the right, and vica versa.

Tiller effect is the expression used to describe how handlebars that extend far behind the steering axis (head tube) act like a [[tiller]] on a boat, in that one moves the bars to the right in order to turn the front wheel to the left, and vice versa. This situation is commonly found on [[cruiser bicycle]]s, some recumbents, and some motorcycles.&lt;ref name=Wood2001/&gt; It can be troublesome when it limits the ability to steer because of interference or the limits of arm reach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==== Tires ====
[[Motorcycle tyres|Tires]] have a large influence over bike handling, especially on motorcycles,&lt;ref name="Cossalter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FoaleBook"/&gt; but also on bicycles.&lt;ref name="Sharp1"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Plochl"&gt;{{cite journal

Increase the crown radius of the front tire has been shown to decrease the size or eliminate self stability. Increasing the crown radius of the rear tire has the opposite effect, but to a lesser degree.&lt;ref name = Sharp1/&gt;

Tires generate the lateral forces necessary for steering and balance through a combination of [[cornering force]] and [[camber thrust]]. Tire inflation pressures have also been found to be important variables in the behavior of a motorcycle at high speeds.&lt;ref name = "Evangelou"/&gt; Because the front and rear tires can have different [[slip angle]]s due to weight distribution, tire properties, etc., bikes can experience [[understeer]] or [[oversteer]]. Of the two, understeer, in which the front wheel slides more than the rear wheel, is more dangerous since front wheel steering is critical for maintaining balance.&lt;ref name="Cossalter"/&gt;
Also, because real tires have a finite [[contact patch]] with the road surface that can generate a scrub torque, and when in a turn, can experience some side slipping as they roll, they can generate torques about an axis [[Surface normal|normal]] to the plane of the contact patch.

[[File:Tire pneumatic trail.png|thumb|right|Bike tire [[contact patch]] during a right-hand turn]]
One torque generated by a tire, called the [[self aligning torque]], is caused by asymmetries in the side-slip along the length of the contact patch. The resultant [[Cornering force|force]] of this side-slip occurs behind the geometric center of the contact patch, a distance described as the [[pneumatic trail]], and so creates a torque on the tire. Since the direction of the side-slip is towards the outside of the turn, the force on the tire is towards the center of the turn. Therefore, this torque tends to turn the front wheel in the direction of the side-slip, away from the direction of the turn, and therefore tends to ''increase'' the radius of the turn.

Another torque is produced by the finite width of the contact patch and the lean of the tire in a turn. The portion of the contact patch towards the outside of the turn is actually moving rearward, with respect to the wheel's hub, faster than the rest of the contact patch, because of its greater radius from the hub. By the same reasoning, the inner portion is moving rearward more slowly. So the outer and inner portions of the contact patch slip on the pavement in opposite directions, generating a torque that tends to turn the front wheel in the direction of the turn, and therefore tends to ''decrease'' the turn radius.

The combination of these two opposite torques creates a resulting [[Yaw (rotation)|yaw]] torque on the front wheel, and its direction is a function of the side-slip angle of the tire, the angle between the actual path of the tire and the direction it is pointing, and the [[camber angle]] of the tire (the angle that the tire leans from the vertical).&lt;ref name="Cossalter"/&gt; The result of this torque is often the suppression of the inversion speed predicted by rigid wheel models described above in the section on [[#Steady-state turning|steady-state turning]].&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt;

==== High side ====
{{Main|Highsider}}
A '''highsider''', '''highside''', or '''high side''' is a type of bike motion which is caused by a rear wheel gaining traction when it is not facing in the direction of travel, usually after slipping sideways in a curve.&lt;ref name="Cossalter"/&gt; This can occur under heavy braking, acceleration, a varying road surface, or suspension activation, especially due to interaction with the drive train.&lt;ref name="Cocco"/&gt; It can take the form of a single slip-then-flip or a series of violent oscillations.&lt;ref name="FoaleBook"/&gt;

===Maneuverability and handling===
Bike maneuverability and handling is difficult to quantify for several reasons. The geometry of a bike, especially the steering axis angle makes [[Kinematics|kinematic]] analysis complicated.&lt;ref name="MPRS"/&gt; Under many conditions, bikes are inherently unstable and must always be under rider control. Finally, the rider's skill has a large influence on the bike's performance in any maneuver.&lt;ref name="Cossalter"/&gt; Bike designs tend to consist of a trade-off between maneuverability and stability.

====Rider control inputs====
[[File:Countersteer response.JPG|thumb|Graphs showing the lean and steer angle response of an otherwise uncontrolled bike, traveling at a forward speed in its stable range (6 m/s), to a steer torque that begins as an impulse and then remains constant. Torque to right causes initial steer to right, lean to left, and eventually a steady-state steer, lean, and turn to left.]]
The primary control input that the rider can make is to apply a [[torque]] directly to the steering mechanism via the handlebars. Because of the bike's own dynamics, due to steering geometry and gyroscopic effects, direct position control over steering angle has been found to be problematic.&lt;ref name="Sharp"/&gt;

A secondary control input that the rider can make is to lean the upper torso relative to the bike. As mentioned above, the effectiveness of rider lean varies inversely with the mass of the bike. On heavy bikes, such as motorcycles, rider lean mostly alters the ground clearance requirements in a turn, improves the view of the road, and improves the bike system dynamics in a very low-frequency passive manner.&lt;ref name="Sharp"/&gt; In motorcycle racing, leaning the torso, moving the body, and projecting a knee to the inside of the turn relative to the bike can also ''cause an aerodynamic yawing moment that facilitates entering and rounding the turn.''&lt;ref name="Cossalter"/&gt;

====Differences from automobiles====
The need to keep a bike upright to avoid injury to the rider and damage to the vehicle even limits the type of maneuverability testing that is commonly performed. For example, while automobile enthusiast publications often perform and quote [[skidpad]] results, motorcycle publications do not. The need to "set up" for a turn, lean the bike to the appropriate angle, means that the rider must see further ahead than is necessary for a typical car at the same speed, and this need increases more than in proportion to the speed.&lt;ref name="Sharp"/&gt;

====Rating schemes====
Several schemes have been devised to rate the handling of bikes, particularly motorcycles.&lt;ref name="Cossalter"/&gt;

*The '''roll index''' is the ratio between steering torque and roll or lean angle.
*The '''acceleration index''' is the ratio between steering torque and lateral or [[Centripetal acceleration#Tangential and centripetal acceleration|centripetal acceleration]].
*The '''steering ratio''' is the ratio between the theoretical turning radius based on ideal tire behavior and the actual turning radius.&lt;ref name="Cossalter"/&gt; Values less than one, where the front wheel [[Slip angle|side slip]] is greater than the rear wheel side slip, are described as [[Understeer|under-steering]]; equal to one as neutral steering; and greater than one as [[Oversteer|over-steering]]. Values less than zero, in which the front wheel must be turned opposite the direction of the curve due to much greater rear wheel side slip than front wheel have been described as counter-steering. Riders tend to prefer neutral or slight over-steering.&lt;ref name="Cossalter"/&gt; Car drivers tend to prefer under-steering.
*The '''Koch index''' is the ratio between peak steering torque and the product of peak lean rate and forward speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Lateral motion theory===
Although its equations of motion can be linearized, a bike is a [[nonlinear system]]. The variable(s) to be solved for cannot be written as a linear sum of independent components, i.e. its behavior is not expressible as a sum of the behaviors of its descriptors.&lt;ref name="MPRS"/&gt; Generally, nonlinear systems are difficult to solve and are much less understandable than linear systems. In the idealized case, in which friction and any flexing is ignored, a bike is a [[Conservation of energy#Mechanics|conservative]] system. [[Damping]], however, can still be demonstrated: under the right circumstances, side-to-side oscillations will decrease with time. Energy added with a sideways jolt to a bike running straight and upright (demonstrating [[#Self-stability|self-stability]]) is converted into increased forward speed, not lost, as the oscillations die out.&lt;ref name="MPRS"/&gt;

A bike is a [[nonholonomic system]] because its outcome is [[Path (topology)|path]]-dependent. In order to know its exact configuration, especially location, it is necessary to know not only the configuration of its parts, but also their histories: how they have moved over time. This complicates mathematical analysis.&lt;ref name="fajans" /&gt; Finally, in the language of [[control theory]], a bike exhibits [[Minimum phase#Mixed phase|non-minimum phase]] behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Degrees of freedom====
[[File:Bike lean angle steer angle and turn radius.PNG|thumb|Graphs of bike steer angle and lean angle vs turn radius.]]
The number of [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]] of a bike depends on the particular [[Scientific modelling|model]] being used. The simplest model that captures the key dynamic features, called the "Whipple model" after Francis Whipple who first developed the equations for it,&lt;ref name="MPRS"/&gt; has four rigid bodies with knife edge wheels rolling without slip on a flat smooth surface, and has 7 degrees of freedom (configuration variables required to completely describe the location and orientation of all 4 bodies):&lt;ref name="MPRS"/&gt;
#''x'' coordinate of rear wheel contact point
#''y'' coordinate of rear wheel contact point
#orientation angle of rear frame ([[Yaw angle|yaw]])
#rotation angle of rear wheel
#rotation angle of front wheel
#lean angle of rear frame ([[Yaw angle|roll]])
#steering angle between rear frame and front end
Adding complexity to the model, such as rider movement, suspension movement, tire compliance, or frame flex, adds degrees of freedom. While the rear frame does [[Yaw angle|pitch]] with leaning and steering, the pitch angle is completely constrained by the requirement for both wheels to remain on the ground, and so can be calculated geometrically from the other seven variables. If the location of the bike and the rotation of the wheels are ignored, the first five degrees of freedom can also be ignored, and the bike can be described by just two variables: lean angle and steer angle.

====Equations of motion====
The [[Equation of motion|equations of motion]] of an idealized bike, consisting of
*a rigid [[bicycle frame|frame]],
*a rigid fork,
*two knife-edged, rigid [[bicycle wheel|wheels]],
*all connected with frictionless bearings and rolling without friction or slip on a smooth horizontal surface and
*operating at or near the upright and straight-ahead, unstable equilibrium

can be represented by a single fourth-order [[Linearization|linearized]] [[ordinary differential equation]] or two coupled second-order differential equations,&lt;ref name="MPRS"/&gt; the lean equation
:&lt;math&gt; M_{\theta\theta}\ddot{\theta_r} +
        K_{\theta\theta}\theta_r +
        M_{\theta\psi}\ddot{\psi} +
        C_{\theta\psi}\dot{\psi} +
        K_{\theta\psi}\psi =
        M_{\theta}
&lt;/math&gt;
and the steer equation
:&lt;math&gt; M_{\psi\psi}\ddot{\psi} +
        C_{\psi\psi}\dot{\psi} +
        K_{\psi\psi}\psi +
        M_{\psi\theta}\ddot{\theta_r} +
        C_{\psi\theta}\dot{\theta_r} +
        K_{\psi\theta}\theta_r =
        M_{\psi}\mbox{,}
&lt;/math&gt;
where 
*&lt;math&gt;\theta_r &lt;/math&gt; is the lean angle of the rear assembly,
*&lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is the steer angle of the front assembly relative to the rear assembly and
*&lt;math&gt;M_{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M_{\psi}&lt;/math&gt; are the moments (torques) applied at the rear assembly and the steering axis, respectively. For the analysis of an uncontrolled bike, both are taken to be zero.
These can be represented in matrix form as 
:&lt;math&gt;M\mathbf{\ddot{q}}+C\mathbf{\dot{q}}+K\mathbf q=\mathbf f&lt;/math&gt;
where
*&lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the symmetrical mass matrix which contains terms that include only the mass and geometry of the bike,
*&lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is the so-called damping matrix, even though an idealized bike has no dissipation, which contains terms that include the forward speed &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and is asymmetric,
*&lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is the so-called stiffness matrix which contains terms that include the gravitational constant &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v^2&lt;/math&gt; and is symmetric in &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; and asymmetric in &lt;math&gt;v^2&lt;/math&gt;,
*&lt;math&gt;\mathbf q&lt;/math&gt; is a vector of lean angle and steer angle, and
*&lt;math&gt;\mathbf f&lt;/math&gt; is a vector of external forces, the moments mentioned above.

In this idealized and linearized model, there are many [[Bicycle and motorcycle geometry|geometric parameters]] (wheelbase, head angle, mass of each body, wheel radius, etc.), but only four significant variables: lean angle, lean rate, steer angle, and steer rate. These equations have been verified by comparison with multiple numeric models derived completely independently.&lt;ref name="MPRS"/&gt;

The equations show that the bicycle is like an inverted pendulum with the lateral position of its support controlled by terms representing roll acceleration, roll velocity and roll displacement to steering torque feedback. The roll acceleration term is normally of the wrong sign for self-stabilization and can be expected to be important mainly in respect of wobble oscillations. The roll velocity feedback is of the correct sign, is gyroscopic in nature, being proportional to speed, and is dominated by the front wheel contribution. The roll displacement term is the most important one and is mainly controlled by trail, steering rake and the offset of the front frame mass center from the steering axis. All the terms involve complex combinations of bicycle design parameters and sometimes the speed. The limitations of the benchmark bicycle are considered and extensions to the treatments of tires, frames and riders

Optimal rider controls for stabilization and path-following control are also discussed.&lt;ref name="Sharp1"/&gt;

====Eigenvalues====
[[File:BicycleEigenvalues.svg|right|thumb|300px|Eigenvalues plotted against forward speed for a typical [[utility bicycle]] simplified to have knife-edge wheels that roll without slip.]]

It is possible to calculate [[eigenvalues]], one for each of the four [[state variable]]s (lean angle, lean rate, steer angle, and steer rate), from the linearized equations in order to analyze the [[normal mode]]s and self-stability of a particular bike design. In the plot to the right, eigenvalues of one particular bicycle are calculated for forward speeds of 0–10&amp;nbsp;m/s (22&amp;nbsp;mph). When the [[Real number|real]] parts of all eigenvalues (shown in dark blue) are negative, the bike is self-stable. When the [[Imaginary number|imaginary]] parts of any eigenvalues (shown in cyan) are non-zero, the bike exhibits [[oscillation]]. The eigenvalues are point symmetric about the origin and so any bike design with a self-stable region in forward speeds will not be self-stable going backwards at the same speed.&lt;ref name="MPRS"/&gt;

There are three forward speeds that can be identified in the plot to the right at which the motion of the bike changes qualitatively:&lt;ref name="MPRS"/&gt;
#The forward speed at which oscillations begin, at about 1&amp;nbsp;m/s (2.2&amp;nbsp;mph) in this example, sometimes called the ''double root'' speed due to there being a repeated [[root of a function|root]] to the [[characteristic polynomial]] (two of the four eigenvalues have exactly the same value). Below this speed, the bike simply falls over as an [[inverted pendulum]] does.
#The forward speed at which oscillations do not increase, where the weave mode eigenvalues switch from positive to negative in a [[Hopf bifurcation]] at about 5.3&amp;nbsp;m/s (12&amp;nbsp;mph) in this example, is called the ''weave speed''. Below this speed, oscillations increase until the uncontrolled bike falls over. Above this speed, oscillations eventually die out.
#The forward speed at which non-oscillatory leaning increases, where the capsize mode eigenvalues switch from negative to positive in a [[pitchfork bifurcation]] at about 8&amp;nbsp;m/s (18&amp;nbsp;mph) in this example, is called the ''capsize speed''. Above this speed, this non-oscillating lean eventually causes the uncontrolled bike to fall over.
Between these last two speeds, if they both exist, is a range of forward speeds at which the particular bike design is self-stable. In the case of the bike whose eigenvalues are shown here, the self-stable range is 5.3–8.0&amp;nbsp;m/s (12&amp;ndash;18&amp;nbsp;mph). The fourth eigenvalue, which is usually stable (very negative), represents the castoring behavior of the front wheel, as it tends to turn towards the direction in which the bike is traveling. Note that this idealized model does not exhibit the ''[[#Wobble or shimmy|wobble or shimmy]]'' and ''[[#Rear wobble|rear wobble]]'' instabilities described above. They are seen in models that incorporate tire interaction with the ground or other degrees of freedom.&lt;ref name="Cossalter" /&gt;

Experimentation with real bikes has so far confirmed the weave mode predicted by the eigenvalues. It was found that tire slip and frame flex are ''not important for the lateral dynamics of the bicycle in the speed range up to 6'' m/s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

====Modes====
[[File:Lean and steer angles of uncontrolled bike at various forward speeds.PNG|thumb|Graphs that show (from left to right, top to bottom) weave instability, self-stability, marginal self-stability, and capsize instability in an idealized linearized model of an uncontrolled [[utility bicycle]].]]

Bikes, as complex mechanisms, have a variety of [[Normal mode|modes]]: fundamental ways that they can move. These modes can be stable or unstable, depending on the bike parameters and its forward speed. In this context, "stable" means that an uncontrolled bike will continue rolling forward without falling over as long as forward speed is maintained. Conversely, "unstable" means that an uncontrolled bike will eventually fall over, even if forward speed is maintained. The modes can be differentiated by the speed at which they switch stability and the relative phases of leaning and steering as the bike experiences that mode. Any bike motion consists of a combination of various amounts of the possible modes, and there are three main modes that a bike can experience: capsize, weave, and wobble.&lt;ref name="MPRS"/&gt; A lesser known mode is rear wobble, and it is usually stable.&lt;ref name="Cossalter"/&gt;

=====Capsize=====
''Capsize'' is the word used to describe a bike falling over without oscillation. During capsize, an uncontrolled front wheel usually steers in the direction of lean, but never enough to stop the increasing lean, until a very high lean angle is reached, at which point the steering may turn in the opposite direction. A capsize can happen very slowly if the bike is moving forward rapidly. Because the capsize instability is so slow, on the order of seconds, it is easy for the rider to control, and is actually used by the rider to initiate the lean necessary for a turn.&lt;ref name="Cossalter" /&gt;

For most bikes, depending on geometry and mass distribution, capsize is stable at low speeds, and becomes less stable as speed increases until it is no longer stable. However, on many bikes, tire interaction with the pavement is sufficient to prevent capsize from becoming unstable at high speeds.&lt;ref name="Cossalter" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson" /&gt;

=====Weave=====
''Weave'' is the word used to describe a slow (0&amp;ndash;4&amp;nbsp;Hz) oscillation between leaning left and steering right, and vice versa. The entire bike is affected with significant changes in steering angle, lean angle (roll), and heading angle (yaw). The steering is 180° out of phase with the heading and 90° out of phase with the leaning.&lt;ref name="Cossalter" /&gt; This [http://www2.ee.ic.ac.uk/cap/cappp/projects/2/files/weave_0_65.avi AVI movie] shows weave.

For most bikes, depending on geometry and mass distribution, weave is unstable at low speeds, and becomes less pronounced as speed increases until it is no longer unstable. While the amplitude may decrease, the frequency actually increases with speed.&lt;ref name="weave_hd"/&gt;

====={{Anchor|Wobble}}Wobble or shimmy=====
[[File:MotorcycleEigenvalues.PNG|right|thumb|300px|Eigenvalues plotted against forward speed for a [[motorcycle]] modeled with frame flexibility and realistic tire properties. Additional modes can be seen, such as [[speed wobble|wobble]], which becomes unstable at 43.7 m/s.]]
[[File:MotorcycleRootLocus.PNG|right|thumb|300px|The same eigenvalues as in the figure above, but plotted on a [[root locus]] plot. Several additional oscillating modes are visible.]]
''Wobble'', ''shimmy'', ''tank-slapper'', ''[[speed wobble]]'', and ''death wobble'' are all words and phrases used to describe a rapid (4&amp;ndash;10&amp;nbsp;Hz) oscillation of primarily just the front end (front wheel, fork, and handlebars). Also involved is the yawing of the rear frame which may contribute to the wobble when too flexible.&lt;ref&gt;Roe, G. E. and Thorpe, T. E. "A Solution of the low-speed wheel flutter instability in motorcycles" Journal Mechanical Engineering Science V 18 No. 2 1976&lt;/ref&gt; This instability occurs mostly at high speed and is similar to that experienced by shopping cart wheels, airplane landing gear, and automobile front wheels.&lt;ref name="Cossalter" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson" /&gt; While wobble or shimmy can be easily remedied by adjusting speed, position, or grip on the handlebar, it can be fatal if left uncontrolled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The restoring force is applied in phase with the progress of the irregularity, and the wheel turns to the other side where the process is repeated. If there is insufficient [[steering damper|damping]] in the steering the oscillation will increase until system failure occurs. The oscillation frequency can be changed by changing the forward speed, making the bike stiffer or lighter, or increasing the stiffness of the steering, of which the rider is a main component.&lt;ref name="wobble_exp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="whitt" /&gt;

=====Rear wobble=====
The term ''rear wobble'' is used to describe a mode of oscillation in which lean angle (roll) and heading angle (yaw) are almost in phase and both 180° out of phase with steer angle. The rate of this oscillation is moderate with a maximum of about 6.5&amp;nbsp;Hz. Rear wobble is heavily damped and falls off quickly as bike speed increases.&lt;ref name="Cossalter" /&gt;

=====Design criteria=====
The effect that the design parameters of a bike have on these modes can be investigated by examining the eigenvalues of the linearized equations of motion.&lt;ref name = "Evangelou"&gt;{{cite web

Some general conclusions that have been drawn are described here.

The lateral and torsional stiffness of the [[Motorcycle frame|rear frame]] and the wheel spindle affects wobble-mode damping substantially. Long [[Trail (bicycles)#Wheelbase|wheelbase]] and [[Trail (bicycles)#Trail|trail]] and a flat [[Trail (bicycles)#Steering axis angle|steering-head angle]] have been found to increase weave-mode damping. Lateral distortion can be countered by locating the [[Motorcycle fork|front fork]] torsional axis as low as possible.

Cornering weave tendencies are amplified by degraded damping of the [[Suspension (motorcycle)#Rear suspension|rear suspension]]. Cornering, camber stiffnesses and relaxation length of the rear [[tire]] make the largest contribution to weave damping. The same parameters of the front tire have a lesser effect. Rear loading also amplifies cornering weave tendencies. Rear load assemblies with appropriate stiffness and damping, however, were successful in damping out weave and wobble oscillations.

One study has shown theoretically that, while a bike leaned in a turn, road undulations can excite the weave mode at high speed or the wobble mode at low speed if either of their frequencies match the vehicle speed and other parameters. Excitation of the wobble mode can be mitigated by an effective [[steering damper]] and excitation of the weave mode is worse for light riders than for heavy riders.&lt;ref name="LSE"&gt;{{cite journal

Although bicycles and motorcycles can appear to be simple mechanisms with only four major moving parts (frame, fork, and two wheels), these parts are arranged in a way that makes them complicated to analyze.&lt;ref name="whitt" /&gt; While it is an observable fact that bikes can be ridden even when the [[Gyroscopic#Properties|gyroscopic effects]] of their wheels are canceled out,&lt;ref name="klein" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jones" /&gt; the hypothesis that the gyroscopic effects of the wheels are what keep a bike upright is common in print and online.&lt;ref name="klein" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fajans" /&gt;

Bikes may experience a variety of longitudinal forces and motions. On most bikes, when the front wheel is turned to one side or the other, the entire rear frame pitches forward slightly, depending on the steering axis angle and the amount of trail.&lt;ref name="Cossalter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hand"/&gt; On bikes with suspensions, either front, rear, or both, '''trim''' is used to describe the geometric configuration of the bike, especially in response to forces of braking, accelerating, turning, drive train, and aerodynamic drag.&lt;ref name="Cossalter"/&gt;

The load borne by the two wheels varies not only with center of mass location, which in turn varies with the amount and location of passengers and luggage, but also with acceleration and deceleration. This phenomenon is known as [[load transfer]]&lt;ref name="Cossalter"/&gt; or [[weight transfer]],&lt;ref name="FoaleBook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cocco"&gt;{{cite book

For example, motorcycle racers can use it to increase the friction available to the front tire when cornering, and attempts to reduce front suspension compression during heavy braking has spawned several [[motorcycle fork]] designs.

The net aerodynamic drag forces may be considered to act at a single point, called the [[Center of pressure (fluid mechanics)|center of pressure]].&lt;ref name="FoaleBook"/&gt; At high speeds, this will create a net moment about the rear driving wheel and result in a net transfer of load from the front wheel to the rear wheel.&lt;ref name="FoaleBook"/&gt; Also, depending on the shape of the bike and the shape of any [[Motorcycle fairing|fairing]] that might be installed, aerodynamic [[Lift (force)|lift]] may be present that either increases or further reduces the load on the front wheel.&lt;ref name="FoaleBook"/&gt;

===Stability===
Though longitudinally stable when stationary, a bike may become longitudinally unstable under sufficient acceleration or deceleration, and [[Euler's laws#Euler's second law|Euler's second law]] can be used to analyze the ground reaction forces generated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

:&lt;math&gt;N_r = mg\left(\frac{L-b}{L} - \mu \frac{h}{L}\right)&lt;/math&gt; for the rear wheel and &lt;math&gt;N_f = mg\left(\frac{b}{L} + \mu \frac{h}{L}\right)&lt;/math&gt; for the front wheel.
The frictional (horizontal) forces are simply
:&lt;math&gt;F_r = \mu N_r \,&lt;/math&gt; for the rear wheel and &lt;math&gt;F_f = \mu N_f \,&lt;/math&gt; for the front wheel,
where &lt;math&gt; \mu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[coefficient of friction]], &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the total [[mass]] of the bike and rider, and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the acceleration of gravity. Therefore, if
:&lt;math&gt;\mu \ge \frac{L-b}{h},&lt;/math&gt;
which occurs if the center of mass is anywhere above or in front of a line extending back from the front wheel contact patch and inclined at the angle
:&lt;math&gt;\theta = \tan^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{\mu} \right) \,&lt;/math&gt;
above the horizontal,&lt;ref name="FoaleBook"/&gt; then the normal force of the rear wheel will be zero (at which point the equation no longer applies) and the bike will begin to flip or loop forward over the front wheel.

On the other hand, if the center of mass height is behind or below the line, such as on most [[tandem bicycle]]s or long-wheel-base recumbent bicycles, as well as [[car]]s, it is less likely that the front wheel can generate enough braking force to flip the bike. This means they can decelerate up to nearly the limit of adhesion of the tires to the road, which could reach 0.8 g if the coefficient of friction is 0.8, which is 40% more than an upright bicycle under even the best conditions. ''Bicycling Science'' author [[David Gordon Wilson]] points out that this puts upright bicyclists at particular risk of causing a rear-end collision if they tailgate cars.&lt;ref name=Wilson2004/&gt;

Similarly, powerful motorcycles can generate enough torque at the rear wheel to lift the front wheel off the ground in a maneuver called a [[wheelie]]. A line similar to the one described above to analyze braking performance can be drawn from the rear wheel contact patch to predict if a wheelie is possible given the available friction, the center of mass location, and sufficient power.&lt;ref name="FoaleBook"/&gt; This can also happen on bicycles, although there is much less power available, if the center of mass is back or up far enough or the rider lurches back when applying power to the pedals.&lt;ref name="Cassidy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bicycling.com/article/0,6610,s1-4-41-12709-1,00.html |title=Bicycling Magazine: The Wheelie |last=Cassidy |first=Chris |accessdate=2009-05-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224041614/http://bicycling.com/article/0%2C6610%2Cs1-4-41-12709-1%2C00.html |archivedate=February 24, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of course, the angle of the terrain can influence all of the calculations above. All else remaining equal, the risk of pitching over the front end is reduced when riding up hill and increased when riding down hill. The possibility of performing a wheelie increases when riding up hill,&lt;ref name="Cassidy"/&gt; and is a major factor in motorcycle [[Rachau#Rachau hillclimb|hillclimbing]] competitions.

===Braking according to ground conditions===
[[File:Bicycle and motorcycle dynamics Stability 1C.png|thumb|With no braking, on a bicycle ''m'' is usually approximately over the bottom bracket]]
When braking, the rider in motion is seeking to change the speed of the combined mass ''m'' of rider plus bike. This is a negative acceleration ''a'' in the line of travel. ''F''=''ma'', the acceleration ''a'' causes an [[Inertial force|inertial]] forward force ''F'' on mass ''m''.
The braking ''a'' is from an initial speed ''u'' to a final speed ''v'', over a length of time ''t''. The equation ''u'' - ''v'' = ''at'' implies that the greater the acceleration the shorter the time needed to change speed. The stopping distance ''s'' is also shortest when acceleration ''a'' is at the highest possible value compatible with road conditions: the equation ''s'' = ''ut'' + 1/2 ''at''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; makes ''s'' low when ''a'' is high and ''t'' is low.

How much braking force to apply to each wheel depends both on ground conditions and on the balance of weight on the wheels at each instant in time. The total braking force cannot exceed the gravity force on the rider and bike times the coefficient of friction ''µ'' of the tire on the ground. ''mgµ'' &gt;= ''Ff'' + ''Fr''. A skid occurs if the ratio of either ''Ff'' over ''Nf'' or ''Fr'' over ''Nr'' is greater than ''µ'', with a rear wheel skid having less of a negative impact on lateral stability.

When braking, the inertial force ''ma'' in the line of travel, not being co-linear with ''f'', tends to rotate ''m'' about ''f''. This tendency to rotate, an overturning moment, is resisted by a moment from ''mg''.  [[File:Bicycle and motorcycle dynamics Stability 2C.png|thumb|In light braking, ''Nr'' is still significant so ''Fr'' can contribute towards braking. ''Nr'' decreases as ''ma'' increases]]

Taking moments about the front wheel contact point at an instance in time:
*When there is no braking, mass ''m'' is typically above the bottom bracket, about 2/3 of the way back between the front and rear wheels, with ''Nr'' thus greater than ''Nf''. 
*In constant light braking, whether because an emergency stop is not required or because poor ground conditions prevent heavy braking, much weight still rests on the rear wheel, meaning that ''Nr'' is still large and ''Fr'' can contribute towards ''a''. 
*As braking ''a'' increases, ''Nr'' and ''Fr'' decrease because the moment ''mah'' increases with ''a''. At maximum constant ''a'', clockwise and anti-clockwise moments are equal, at which point ''Nr'' = 0. Any greater ''Ff'' initiates a stoppie. [[File:Bicycle and motorcycle dynamics Stability 3C.png|thumb|At maximum braking, ''Nr'' = 0]]
Other factors:
*Downhill it is much easier to topple over the front wheel because the incline moves the line of ''mg'' closer to ''f''. To try to reduce this tendency the rider can stand back on the pedals to try to keep ''m'' as far back as possible.
*When braking is increasing the center of mass ''m'' may move forward relative to the front wheel, as the rider moves forward relative to the bike, and, if the bike has suspension on the front wheel, the front forks compress under load, changing the bike geometry. This all puts extra load on the front wheel. 
*At the end of a brake maneuver, as the rider comes to a halt, the suspension decompresses and pushes the rider back.

Values for ''µ'' vary greatly depending on a number of factors:
*The material that the ground or road surface is made of.
*Whether the ground is wet or dry.
*The smoothness or roughness of the ground.
*The firmness or looseness of the ground.
*The speed of the vehicle, with friction reducing above 30&amp;nbsp;mph (50kph).
*Whether friction is rolling or sliding, with sliding friction at least 10% below peak rolling friction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Braking===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Bicycle brake systems]] --&gt;
[[File:Stoppie.jpg|thumb|A motorcyclist performing a [[stoppie]].]]
Most of the braking force of standard upright bikes comes from the front wheel. As the analysis above shows, if the [[Bicycle brake systems|brakes]] themselves are strong enough, the rear wheel is easy to skid, while the front wheel often can generate enough stopping force to flip the rider and bike over the front wheel. This is called a ''[[stoppie]]'' if the rear wheel is lifted but the bike does not flip, or an ''endo'' (abbreviated form of ''end-over-end'') if the bike flips. On long or low bikes, however, such as [[Types of motorcycle#Cruiser|cruiser motorcycles]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Assuming no loss of balance, it is possible to calculate optimum braking performance depending on the bike's geometry, the location of center of gravity of bike and rider, and the maximum coefficient of friction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In the case of a front [[Suspension (motorcycle)|suspension]], especially telescoping [[fork tube]]s, the increase in downward force on the front wheel during braking may cause the suspension to compress and the front end to lower. This is known as ''[[Suspension (motorcycle)#Brake dive|brake diving]]''. A riding technique that takes advantage of how braking increases the downward force on the front wheel is known as ''[[trail braking]]''.

====Front wheel braking====
The limiting factors on the maximum deceleration in front wheel braking are:
*the maximum, limiting value of [[static friction]] between the tire and the ground, often between 0.5 and 0.8 for [[rubber]] on dry [[asphalt]],&lt;ref name="kurtus"&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.school-for-champions.com/science/frictioncoeff.htm
| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070929005725/http://www.school-for-champions.com/science/frictioncoeff.htm

| accessdate = 2006-08-07
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*the [[kinetic friction]] between the brake pads and the rim or disk, and
*pitching or looping (of bike and rider) over the front wheel.

For an upright bicycle on dry asphalt with excellent brakes, pitching will probably be the limiting factor. The combined center of mass of a typical upright bicycle and rider will be about {{convert|60|cm|in|abbr=on}} back from the front wheel contact patch and {{convert|120|cm|in|abbr=on}} above, allowing a maximum deceleration of 0.5&amp;nbsp;''g'' (5&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or 16&amp;nbsp;ft/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name="whitt"/&gt; If the rider modulates the brakes properly, however, pitching can be avoided. If the rider moves his weight back and down, even larger decelerations are possible.

Front brakes on many inexpensive bikes are not strong enough so, on the road, they are the limiting factor. Cheap cantilever brakes, especially with "power modulators", and Raleigh-style side-pull brakes severely restrict the stopping force. In wet conditions they are even less effective. Front wheel slides are more common off-road. Mud, water, and loose stones reduce the friction between the tire and trail, although knobby tires can mitigate this effect by grabbing the surface irregularities. Front wheel slides are also common on corners, whether on road or off. Centripetal acceleration adds to the forces on the tire-ground contact, and when the friction force is exceeded the wheel slides.

====Rear-wheel braking====
The rear brake of an upright bicycle can only produce about 0.25&amp;nbsp;''g'' (~2.5&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) deceleration at best,&lt;ref name=Wilson2004/&gt; because of the decrease in normal force at the rear wheel as described above. All such bikes with only rear braking are subject to this limitation: for example, bikes with only a [[coaster brake]], and [[Fixed-gear bicycle|fixed-gear]] bikes with no other braking mechanism. There are, however, situations that may warrant rear wheel braking&lt;ref name=SheldonBrakingTurning&gt;{{cite web

*Slippery surfaces or bumpy surfaces. Under front wheel braking, the lower coefficient of friction may cause the front wheel to skid which often results in a loss of balance.&lt;ref name=SheldonBrakingTurning/&gt;
*Front flat tire. Braking a wheel with a flat tire can cause the tire to come off the rim which greatly reduces friction and, in the case of a front wheel, result in a loss of balance.&lt;ref name=SheldonBrakingTurning/&gt;
*To deliberately induce a rear wheel skid to induce oversteer and achieve a smaller turn radius on tight turns.
*Front brake failure.&lt;ref name=SheldonBrakingTurning/&gt;

==Suspension==
[[File:SinglePivotMTBSuspension.jpg|thumb|[[Mountain bike]] rear suspension]]
{{Main|Bicycle suspension}}
{{Main|Suspension (motorcycle)}}
Bikes may have only front, only rear, full suspension or no suspension that operate primarily in the central plane of symmetry; though with some consideration given to lateral compliance.&lt;ref name="FoaleBook"/&gt; The goals of a bike suspension are to reduce vibration experienced by the rider, maintain wheel contact with the ground, reduce the loss of momentum when riding over an object, reduce impact forces caused by jumps or drops and maintain vehicle trim.&lt;ref name="Cossalter"/&gt; The primary suspension parameters are [[stiffness]], [[damping]], sprung and [[unsprung mass]], and [[Motorcycle tyres|tire]] characteristics.&lt;ref name="FoaleBook"/&gt; Besides irregularities in the terrain, brake, acceleration, and drive-train forces can also activate the suspension as described above. Examples include [[Bicycle suspension#Bob and squat|bob]] and [[Bicycle suspension#Pedal feedback|pedal feedback]] on bicycles, the [[shaft effect]] on motorcycles, and

[[File:The Black Beauty.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A modern ceiling fan]]
A '''ceiling fan''' is a [[mechanical fan]], usually [[electric power|electrically powered]], suspended from the [[ceiling]] of a room, that uses hub-mounted [[rotation|rotating]] blades to [[wikt:circulation|circulate]] air.Ceiling fans typically rotate more slowly than other types of circulating fans, such as electric desk fans. They cool people effectively by introducing slow movement into the otherwise still, hot air of a room. Fans never actually cool air, unlike air-conditioning equipment, they in fact heat the air due to the waste heat from the motor and friction,  but use significantly less power (cooling air is [[Thermodynamics|thermodynamically]] expensive). Conversely, a ceiling fan can also be used to reduce the [[:wikt:stratification|stratification]] of warm air in a room by forcing it down to affect both occupants' sensations and thermostat readings, thereby improving [[climate control]] [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]].

==History==
Punkah-type ceiling fans date back to 500 BC, and are native to [[India]]. Unlike modern rotary fans, these punkah fans move air by moving to and fro, and were operated manually by cord.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url= http://navrangindia.blogspot.hk/2015/10/punkah-hand-operated-hanging-fan.html?m=1 |title= Punkah. hand-operated hanging fan. a colonial legacy |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The first rotary ceiling fans appeared in the early 1860s and 1870s in the [[United States]]. At that time, they were not powered by any form of [[electric motor]]. Instead, a stream of running [[water]] was used, in conjunction with a [[turbine]], to drive a system of belts which would turn the blades of two-blade fan units. These systems could accommodate several fan units, and so became popular in stores, [[restaurant]]s, and offices. Some of these systems survive today, and can be seen in parts of the [[southern United States]] where they originally proved useful.

The electrically powered ceiling fan was invented in 1882 by [[Philip Diehl (inventor)|Philip Diehl]]. He had engineered the electric motor used in the first electrically powered Singer [[sewing machine]]s, and in 1882 he adapted that motor for use in a ceiling-mounted fan. Each fan had its own self-contained motor unit, with no need for [[belt drive]].&lt;ref name="fanbook"&gt;{{cite book |last= Scharff |first= Robert |author2= Casablanca Fan Co. |title=The Fan Book |year= 1983 |publisher= Reston Publishing |location= Reston, VA |isbn= 0-8359-1855-6 |page= 128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost immediately he faced fierce competition due to the commercial success of the ceiling fan. He continued to make improvements to his invention and created a light kit fitted to the ceiling fan to combine both functions in one unit. By [[World War I]] most ceiling fans were made with four blades instead of the original two, which made fans quieter and allowed them to circulate more air. The early turn-of-the-century companies who successfully commercialized the sale of ceiling fans in the United States were the Hunter Brothers division of Robbins &amp; Myers, Westinghouse Corporation and Emerson Electric.

By the 1920s, ceiling fans were commonplace in the United States, and had started to take hold internationally. From the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, until the introduction of electric air conditioning in the 1950s, ceiling fans slowly faded out of vogue in the U.S.,&lt;ref name="fanbook"/&gt; almost falling into total disuse in the U.S. by the 1960s; those that remained were considered items of nostalgia.

Meanwhile, electric ceiling fans became very popular in other countries, particularly those with hot climates, such as [[India]] and the [[Middle East]], where a lack of infrastructure and/or financial resources made energy-hungry and complex freon-based [[air conditioning]] equipment impractical. In 1973, Texas entrepreneur H. W. (Hub) Markwardt began importing highly efficient ceiling fans to the [[United States]] that were manufactured in [[India]] by [[Crompton Greaves]], Ltd. Crompton Greaves had been manufacturing ceiling fans since 1937 through a joint venture formed by [[Greaves Cotton]] of India and [[Crompton Parkinson]] of [[England]], and had perfected the world's most energy efficient ceiling fans thanks to its patented 20 pole [[induction motor]] with a highly efficient heat-dissipating cast aluminum rotor. These Indian manufactured ceiling fans caught on slowly at first, but Markwardt's Encon Industries branded ceiling fans (which stood for ENergy CONservation) eventually found great success during the energy crisis of the late 1970s and early 1980s, since they consumed far less energy (under 70 watts of electricity) than the antiquated shaded pole motors used in most other American made fans. The fans became very effective energy saving appliances for residential and commercial use by supplementing expensive air conditioning with a cooling wind-chill effect. Fans used for comfort create a wind chill by increasing the [[heat transfer coefficient]], but do not lower temperatures directly.
[[File:Casablanca Delta ceiling fan.JPG|thumb|300px|right|[[Casablanca Fan Co.]] "Delta" ceiling fan from the early 1980s.]]

Due to this renewed commercial success using ceiling fans effectively as an energy conservation application, many American manufacturers also started to produce, or significantly increase production of, ceiling fans. In addition to the imported Encon ceiling fans, the [[Casablanca Fan Company]] was founded in 1974. Other American manufacturers of the time included the Hunter Fan Co. (which was then a division of Robbins &amp; Myers, Inc), FASCO (F. A. Smith Co.), and [[Emerson Electric]]; which was often branded as [[Sears-Roebuck]].

Through the 1980s and 1990s, ceiling fans remained popular in the United States. Many small American importers, most of them rather short-lived, started importing ceiling fans. Throughout the 1980s, the balance of sales between American-made ceiling fans and those imported from manufacturers in [[India]], [[Taiwan]], [[Hong Kong]] and eventually [[China]] changed dramatically with imported fans taking the lion's share of the market by the late 1980s. Even the most basic U.S-made fans sold for $200 to $500, while the most expensive imported fans rarely exceeded $150.

Since 2000, important inroads have been made by companies such as Monte Carlo, Minka Aire, Quorum, Craftmade, Litex and Fanimation - offering higher price ceiling fans with more decorative value. In 2001, Washington Post writer Patricia Dane Rogers&lt;ref name="Washington Post"&gt;{{cite news |last= Dane Roger |first= Patricia |title= Eye on Design |work= The Washington Post |date= June 14, 2001 |page=H5}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote, “Like so many other mundane household objects, these old standbys are going high-style and high-tech.”

==Uses==
Unlike air conditioners, fans only move air—they do not directly change its temperature. Therefore, ceiling fans that have a mechanism for reversing the direction in which the blades push air (most commonly an electrical switch on the unit's switch housing, motor housing, or lower canopy) can help in both heating and cooling.

Some ceiling fans, mostly Hunter ones made in or before 1984, are mechanically reversible (have adjustable blade pitch) instead of an electrically reversible motor. In this case, the blade should be pitched to the right (or left if the motor spins clockwise) for downdraft, and left (or right if the motor spins clockwise) for updraft. Hunter Hotel Original is one example. In very rare case, such as late 1984 Hunter Original, fans are both mechanically reversible and electrically reversible, in which case it can blow air up, or down, in either direction. Some ceiling fans can only blow air in one direction and are not reversible in any way, more often downdraft only, but rarely updraft only. It's the case on most antique fans, and most industrial fans.

For cooling, the fan's direction of rotation should be set so that air is blown downward (Usually counter-clockwise from beneath), unless in rare case in which more breeze would be felt when blowing upward, such as when it's installed in hallway where blades would be so close to the walls. The blades should lead with the upturned side as they spin. The breeze created by a ceiling fan speeds the evaporation of perspiration on human skin, which makes the body's natural cooling mechanism much more efficient. Since the fan works directly on the body, rather than by changing the temperature of the air, during the summer it is a waste of electricity to leave a ceiling fan on when no one is in a room unless there's air conditioning, open windows, or anything that can heat up the room (such as oven) and fan is just to move air around.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

For heating, ceiling fans should usually be set to turn the opposite direction (usually clockwise; the blades should spin with the downward turned side leading) and on a low speed (or the lowest speed the fan is able to circulate the air down to the floor). Air naturally stratifies—that is, warmer air rises to the ceiling while cooler air sinks. Unfortunately, this means it is colder on or near the floor where human beings spend most of their time. A ceiling fan, with its direction of rotation set so that air is drawn upward, pulls up the colder air below, forcing the warmer air nearer the ceiling to move down to take its place, without blowing a stream of air directly at the occupants of the room. This action works to even out the temperature in the room, making it cooler nearer the ceiling, but warmer nearer the floor. Thus the thermostat in the area can be set a few degrees lower to save energy, while maintaining the same level of comfort. It is important to run the fan at a low speed (or a lowest speed the fan is able to circulate the air down to the floor) to minimize the wind chill effect described above. However if the ceiling is high enough, or the lowest speed downdraft would not create wind chill effect, it can be left on downdraft year around.

An additional use of ceiling fans is coupling them with an air conditioning unit. Through-the-wall/through-the-window air conditioning units typically found in rented properties in North America usually have both the tasks of cooling the air inside the room and circulating it. Provided the ceiling fan is properly sized for the room in which it is operating, its efficiency of moving air far exceeds that of an air conditioning unit, therefore, for peak efficiency, the air conditioner should be set to a low fan setting and the ceiling fan should be used to circulate the air.

==Parts of a ceiling fan==
The key components of a ceiling fan are the following:
* An [[electric motor]]
* Blades (also known as paddles or wings) usually made from wood, plywood, iron, aluminium, MDF or plastic
* Blade irons (also known as blade brackets, blade arms, blade holders, or flanges), which hold the blades and connect them to the motor.
* Flywheel, a metal or plastic or tough rubber double-torus which is attached to the motor shaft, and to which the blade irons may be attached. The flywheel inner ring is locked to the shaft by a lock-screw, and the blade irons to the outer ring by bolts that feed into tapped metal inserts. Rubber or plastic flywheels may become brittle and break, a common cause of fan failure. Replacing the flywheel may require disconnecting wiring and requires removing the switch housing that's on the way for the flywheel to be removed and replaced.
* Rotor, alternative to blade irons. First patented by industrial designer [[Ron Rezek]] in 1991, the one-piece die cast rotor receives and secures the blades and bolts right to the motor, eliminating most balance problems and minimizing exposed fasteners.
* A mechanism for mounting the fan to the ceiling such as:
** Ball-and-socket system. With this system, there is a metal or plastic hemisphere mounted on the end of the downrod; this hemisphere rests in a ceiling-mounted metal bracket, or metal canopy, and allows the fan to move freely (which is very useful on vaulted ceilings). Some companies have come up with slight modifications of this design.
** J-hook (Claw hook) system. A type of mounting system where the ceiling fan hangs on a metal hook, attached to the ceiling. A rubber grommet is used to keep the fan in place and helps avoid vibration on the ceiling.
** U-bolt system. Similar to J-hook system, except that the hook on the ceiling is U-shaped and is being held by screws. One advantage of U-bolt system as opposed to J-hook system is that it wouldn't unscrew itself by the fan's torque in either direction. J-hook can be unscrewed by the fan torque when spinning clockwise (or counterclockwise if J-hook is left-hand threaded).
** Some fans can be mounted using a low-ceiling adapter, a special kit which must be purchased from the fan's manufacturer. This eliminates the need for a downrod, and is therefore useful in rooms with low ceiling clearance.
** In recent years, it has become increasingly common for a ball-and-socket fan to be designed such that the canopy (ceiling cover piece) can optionally be screwed directly into the top of the motor housing; then the whole fan can be secured directly onto the ceiling mounting bracket. This is known as a "close-to-ceiling" mount.

Other components, which vary by model and style, can include:
* A downrod, a metal pipe used to suspend the fan from the ceiling. Downrods come in many lengths and widths, depending on the fan type.
* A decorative encasement for the motor (known as the "motor housing").
* A switch housing (also known as a "switch cup" or "nose column"), a metal or plastic cylinder mounted below and in the center of the fan's motor. The switch housing is used to conceal and protect various components, which can include wires, capacitors, and switches; on fans that require oiling, it often conceals the oil reservoir which lubricates the bearings. The switch housing also makes for a convenient place to mount a light kit.
[[File:Ceiling fan capacitor.png|right|thumb|300px|Ceiling fan capacitors. One on the left is swollen and worn out. One on the right is brand new and in good shape. Capacitor is used on PSC motor and is usually used to control the speeds, and tends to blow out a lot more often than motor does.]]
* Blade badges, decorative adornments attached to the visible underside of the blades for the purpose of concealing the screws used to attach the blades to the blade irons.
* Assorted switches used for turning the fan on and off, adjusting the speed at which the blades rotate, changing the direction in which the blades rotate, and operating any lamps that may be present.
* Lamps
** Uplights, which are installed on top of the fan's motor housing and project light up onto the ceiling, for aesthetic reasons (to "create ambiance")
** Downlights, often referred to as a "light kit", which add ambient light to a room and can be used to replace any ceiling-mounted lamps that were displaced by the installation of a ceiling fan
** Decorative light bulbs mounted inside the motor housing—in this type of setup, the motor housing often has glass panel sections which allow light to shine though.

==Configurations==
* Commercial or industrial ceiling fans are usually used in offices, factories or industries. Commercial ceiling fans are designed to be more cost effective and more energy efficient than other cooling alternatives. The industrial or commercial ceiling fans usually use three blades and operate with a high-speed motor. Some can be found with more than 3 blades though. These energy efficient ceiling fans usually push massive amounts of air compared to other ceiling fan types. In the 1980s, it was common to find metal-bladed industrial ceiling fans in American households, while industrial fans in household applications are still commonplace today in Middle-Eastern households.
* A hugger or low profile ceiling fan is usually installed on a low ceiling. They can also be used in rooms with vaulted ceilings when installed on the joist. In cold climates, a ceiling fan may disperse heat to warm up the room as well by dispersing downwards the warm air that rises to the ceiling surface. Though the ceiling fan cannot lower room temperatures, when used in tandem with a room air-conditioner it may be able to disperse the cool air all around the room.
* Outdoor ceiling fans are ceiling fans designed for outdoor purposes, they are usually water resistant and made of materials that do not get affected by outside temperatures, weather or humidity. Some outdoor ceiling fans are designed to be rained directly on, those are known as "wet" rated ceiling fans. Outdoor ceiling fans that are not designed to be rained directly on are known as "damp" rated.
* "Mini" ceiling fans are mostly found in less developed places, such as the [[Philippines]] and [[Indonesia]], and are made almost entirely out of plastic except for the inside of the motor, etc. These fans, hence the name "mini" ceiling fan are relatively small in size, usually ranging from 16 inches to 36 inches, however some still span to sizes as large as 42 inches in diameter. Additionally, unlike traditional ceiling fans, these fans usually use synchronous motors.
[[File:Ventilateurs de train-Sri Lanka (2).jpg|thumb|Orbit fans inside a train in [[Sri Lanka]].]]
* Orbit fans are fans that use a mechanism to oscillate at 360 degrees. They are also typically flushed to the ceiling like hugger type fans. They are also very small in size, usually about 16" and have a similar construction to that of many pedestal fans and desk fans, and usually have finger guards. These are once again, popular mostly in many developing countries as they are a cheap alternative to traditional paddle type ceiling fans. Many American manufacturers, such as "Fanimation" have started producing high quality designer versions of such fans for their retro design, however, unlike the orbit huggers discussed earlier, these usually include downrods, like many early versions of the orbit fan.

==Operating a ceiling fan==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}
[[File:Ceiling fan.png|thumb|right|A Hunter-branded "Eclipse", which is a basic modern ceiling fan with standard pull-chain controls for the fan motor and light kit]]
The way in which a fan is operated depends on its manufacturer, style, and the era in which it was made. Operating methods include:
* [[Pull switch|Pull-chain]]/pull-cord control. This style of fan is equipped with a metal-bead chain or cloth cord which, when pulled, cycles the fan through the operational speed(s) and then back to off. These fans usually have three speeds.
* Variable-speed control. During the 1970s and 1980s, fans were often produced with a [[Potentiometer|variable-speed control]]. This was a dial mounted on the fan which, when turned in either direction, continuously varied the speed at which the blades rotated—similar to a dimmer switch for a light fixture. A few fans substituted a rotary click-type switch for the infinite-speed dial, providing a set number of speeds (usually ranging from five to ten).
** Different fan manufacturers used the variable-speed control in different ways:
*** The variable-speed dial controlling the fan entirely; to turn the fan on, the user turns the knob until it clicks out of the "off" position, and can then choose the fan's speed.
*** A pull-chain present along with the variable-speed control; the dial can be set in one place and left there, with the pull-chain serving only to turn the fan on and off. Many of these fans have an option to wire the light kit to this pull-chain in order to control both the fan and the light with one chain. Using this method, the user can have either the fan or light on individually, both on, or both off.
*** "Vari-Lo": A pull-chain and variable-speed control are present. Such a fan has two speeds controlled by a pull-chain: high (full power, independent of the position of the variable-speed control), and "Vari-Lo" (speed determined by the position of the variable-speed control).
* Wall-mounted control. Some fans have their control(s) mounted on the wall instead of on the fans themselves; such controls are usually proprietary and/or specialized switches.
[[File:Ceiling fan choke types.jpg|thumb|left|Old-style and new-style chokes]]
** ''Choke''. This style of switch takes varying physical forms. The wall control, which contains a motor speed regulator of some sort, determines how much power is delivered to the fan and therefore how fast it spins. Older such controls employed a [[choke (electronics)|choke]]—a large iron-cored coil—as their regulator; these controls were typically large, boxy, and surface-mounted on the wall. They had anywhere from four to eight speeds, typically four or five. Newer versions of this type of control do not use a choke as such, but much smaller capacitors or electronic circuitry; the switch is typically mounted in a standard in-wall [[gang box]].
** ''Digital control.'' With this style of control, all of the fan's functions—on/off status, speed, direction of rotation, and any attached light fixtures—are controlled by a computerized wall control, which typically does not require any special wiring. Instead, it uses the normal house wiring to send coded electrical pulses to the fan, which decodes and acts on them using a built-in set of electronics. This style of control typically has anywhere from three to six speeds.
** ''Solid state variable speed control.'' These controls, commonly used on industrial fans, can control more than one (up to 15) fans with one switch. 2.5 to 6 amp controls can typically be installed in "gangs" with other solid-state controls or standard light switches or wiring devices, while 8 to 15 amp controls have a large heat sink and cannot be "ganged" with other devices.
* Wireless [[remote control]]. In recent years, remote controls have dropped in price to become cost-effective for controlling ceiling fans. They may be supplied with fans, or fitted to an existing fan. The hand-held remote transmits radio frequency or [[infrared]] control signals to a receiver unit installed in the fan. However, these may not be ideal for commercial installations as the controllers require batteries. They can also get misplaced, especially in installs with many fans.
** ''Directional Switch.'' Most ceiling fans typically feature a small slide switch on the motor body of the fan itself, which controls the direction in which the fan rotates. In one position, the fan is caused to rotate clockwise, in the other position the fan is caused to rotate counter-clockwise. Given that the fan blades are typically slanted, this results in air either being drawn upwards or brought downwards. While the user can select which they prefer, typically air is blown downwards in summer and lifted upwards in winter. The downwards blowing is experienced as "cooling" in summer, while the upwards convection brings ceiling-hugging warm air back down throughout the room in winter.&lt;ref name=direction&gt;{{cite web|title=Ceiling fan direction|url=https://www.lampsusa.com/blogs/how-to-and-tips/13739073-ceiling-fan-rotation-guide|publisher=LampsUSA|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of ceiling fans==
Many styles of ceiling fans have been developed over the years in response to several different factors such as growing energy-consumption consciousness and changes in decorating styles. The advent and evolution of electronic technology has also played a major role in ceiling fan development. Following is a list of major ceiling fan styles and their defining characteristics:
* Cast-iron ceiling fans. Cast-iron ceiling fans account for almost all ceiling fans made from their invention in 1882 through the 1950s. A cast-iron housing encases a very heavy-duty oil-bath motor, usually of the [[Shaded-pole motor|shaded-pole]] variety. These fans must be oiled periodically, usually once or twice per year, since they use an oil-bath system for lubrication. Because these fans are so sturdily built, and due to their utter lack of electronic components, it is not uncommon to see cast-iron fans aged eighty years or more running strong and still in use today.
[[File:Hunter Original.jpg|thumb|left|A cast-iron ceiling fan made by Hunter, dating from the early 1980s. This model is called the "Original".]]
* The Hunter 'Original' (manufactured by the Hunter Fan Co., formerly a division of Robbins &amp; Myers, Inc.) is an example of a cast-iron ceiling fan. It has enjoyed the longest production run of any fan in history, dating from 1906 to the present (it is still being manufactured). The 52" Original employed a [[shaded-pole motor]] from its inception until 1984, at which point it was changed to a [[Electric motors#Permanent split-capacitor motor|permanent split-capacitor]] motor. The 36"/38" Original always employed a shaded pole motor, until it was discontinued somewhere in 1985, in which it was replaced with 42" Original with permanent split-capacitor motor. Though the fan's physical appearance remained unchanged, the motor was further downgraded in 2002 when production was shipped to [[Taiwan]]; the motor, though still oil-lubricated, was switched to a "skeletal" design, as discussed below. Then in 2015, when the model was revised, the motor, while still skeletal, got pre-2002 elements back, such as 4" main shaft. Post-2015 Original also has wood blades with PVC overlay for outdoor use, and therefore is damp rated.
* 20 pole Induction "Pancake" motor ceiling fans. These fans with highly efficient cast aluminum housings, were invented in 1957 by Crompton-Greaves, Ltd of [[India]] and were first imported into the [[United States]] in 1973 by Encon Industries. This Crompton-Greaves motor was developed through a joint venture with Crompton-Parkinson of England and took 20 years to perfect. It is considered the most energy efficient motor ever manufactured for ceiling fans (apart from the DC motor) since it consumes less energy than a household incandescent light bulb.

* Stack-motor ceiling fans. In the late 1970s, due to rising energy costs prompted by the [[1979 energy crisis|energy crisis]], [[Emerson Electric Company|Emerson]] invented a new style of electric motor designed specifically for ceiling fans, the "stack" motor. Along with Encon's cast aluminum 20 pole motor, this powerful, energy-efficient motor aided in the comeback of ceiling fans in America, since it was far less expensive to operate than air conditioning. With this design (which consists of a basic [[stator]] and [[Rotor (electric)|rotor]]), the fan's blades mount to a central hub, known as a [[flywheel]]. The flywheel can be made of either metal or reinforced rubber, and can be mounted either flush with the fan's motor housing (concealed) or prominently below the fan's motor housing (known as a "dropped flywheel"). Many manufacturers used and/or developed their own stack motors, including (but not limited to) Casablanca, Emerson, FASCO, Hunter, and [[NuTone]]. Some manufacturers trademarked their personal incarnation of this motor: for example, Emerson came out with the "K55" and "K63" motors, Fanimation with the "FDK-2100", and Casablanca with the "XLP-2000". One of the earliest stack-motor fans was the Emerson "Heat-Fan", aka the "Universal Series", a utilitarian fan with a dropped metal flywheel and blades made of either [[fiberglass]] or [[plastic]] depending on the model. This fan was produced from 1976 through 1983 and, while targeted at commercial settings, also found great success in residential settings. Casablanca Fan Co. also made stack-motor fans with concealed flywheels rather than dropped flywheels. While this motor is not nearly as widely used as in the 1970s and 1980s, it can still be found in certain high-end Emerson, and Fanimation fans.  One disadvantage of this type of fan is that the flywheel, if it is made from rubber, will dry out and crack over time and eventually break; this is usually not dangerous, but it renders the fan inoperable until the flywheel is replaced.

* Direct-drive ceiling fans employ a motor with a stationary inner core with a shell, made of cast-iron, cast-aluminum, or stamped steel (usually cheap low end fans), that revolves around it (commonly called a "spinner" motor). The blades are attached to this shell. Direct-drive motors are the least expensive motors to produce, and on the whole are the most prone to failure and noise generation.&lt;ref name="fanbook"/&gt; While the very first motors of this type (first used in the 1960s) were relatively heavy-duty, the quality of these motors has dropped significantly in recent years. This type of motor has become the standard for today's fans; it is used in most [[Home Depot|Hampton Bay]] and [[Lowe's|Harbor Breeze]] ceiling fans, and has become commonly used by all other brands.
[[File:A Dual blade Ceiling fan in India.JPG|thumb|right|A Dual-blade Spinner fan from India]]
** Spinner fans employ a direct-drive motor and do not have a stationary decorative cover (motor housing). This accounts for most [[Industrial Style|industrial-style]] fans (though such fans sometimes have more moderate-quality motors), and inexpensive residential fans used in most asian countries.
** Spinner-motor fans, sometimes incorrectly referred to as "spinners", employ a direct-drive (spinner) motor and ''do'' have a stationary decorative cover (motor housing). "Spinner-motor" fans account for nearly all fans manufactured from the late 1980s to the present.
* Skeletal motors, which are a high-quality subset of direct-drive motors, can be found on some higher-quality fans. Examples of skeletal motors include Hunter's "AirMax" motor, Casablanca's "XTR200" motor, and the motors made by Lasko for use in their ceiling fans, and as of 2002 Hunter Original have oil-bath skeletal motor. Skeletal motors differ from regular direct-drive motors in that:
** They have an open ("skeletal") design, which allows for far better ventilation and therefore a longer lifespan. This is in comparison to a regular direct-drive motor's design, in which the motor's inner workings are completely enclosed within a tight metal shell which may or may not have openings for ventilation; even when openings are present, they are almost always small to the point of being inadequate.
** They are typically larger than regular direct-drive motors and, as a result, are more powerful and less prone to burning out.
* Friction-drive ceiling fans. This short-lived type of ceiling fan was attempted by companies such as Emerson and NuTone in the late 1970s with little success. Its advantage was its tremendously low power consumption, but the fans were unreliable and very noisy, in addition to being grievously underpowered. Friction-drive ceiling fans employ a low-[[torque]] motor that is mounted transversely in relation to the flywheel. A rubber wheel mounted on the end of the motor's shaft drove a hub (via contact friction, hence the name) which, in turn, drove the flywheel. It was a system based on the fact that a low-torque motor spinning quickly can drive a large, heavy device at a slow speed without great energy consumption ''(see [[Gear ratio]])''.
* Gear-drive ceiling fans. These were similar to (and even less common than) the friction drive models; however, instead of a rubber wheel on the motor shaft using friction to turn the flywheel, a gear on the end of the motor shaft meshed with gear teeth formed into the flywheel, thus rotating it. The company "Panama" made gear driven ceiling fans and sold them through "Family Handyman" magazine in the 1980s.
* Internal belt-drive ceiling fans. These were also similar in design to gear-drive and friction-drive fans; however, instead of a rubber friction wheel or toothed gear, a small rubber belt linked the motor to the flywheel. The most notable internal belt-drive ceiling fan was a model sold by [[Toastmaster (appliances)|Toastmaster]].
[[File:Registrator output.png|thumb|right|Three fans driven by a single motor and belts]]
* Belt-driven ceiling fans. As stated earlier in this article, the first ceiling fans used a water-powered system of [[Belt (mechanical)|belts]] to turn the blades of fan units (which consisted of nothing more than blades mounted on a flywheel). For period-themed decor, a few companies (notably Fanimation and Woolen Mill) have created reproduction belt-drive fan systems. The reproduction systems feature an electric motor as the driving force, in place of the water-powered motor.
* DC ceiling fans. These fans use a [[brushless DC motor]] that offer much better efficiency than traditional fans driven with AC motors. They usually are quieter than AC motor fans due to the fact they are commutated electronically and use permanent magnet rotors. Among many advantages these fans offer some are higher efficiency, lower noise level, less rotor heat, integration of remote control and other convenience technologies etc. The only drawbacks are the high cost and the presence of complex electronics which may be more likely to fail, making them not ideal for commercial installs containing a large number of fans. However, with the advent of new technologies and better quality control techniques, the latter is becoming less of a concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DC vs AC Ceiling Fans|url=http://www.hunterfan.co.uk/blog/dc-vs-ac-ceiling-fans/|publisher=www.hunterfan.co.uk|accessdate=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Hugger ceiling fans (also known as "flush mount" or "low profile" ceiling fans) have no downrod or canopy like a traditional mount fan, and the motor housing is mounted directly to the mount. Hugger style fans generally have spinner motors, and use a special mounting bracket that holds the motor assembly and the motor housing. They are typically used in rooms with low ceilings. A disadvantage to this design it that since the blades are mounted so close to the ceiling, the air movement is greatly reduced. 
* Bladeless ceiling fans.  This type was introduced in 2012 by Exhale fans and uses a [[Boundary layer#Boundary layer turbine|bladeless turbine]] to push air outwards from the fan, which is also the case of regular ceiling fans on updraft mode. These feature a [[brushless DC motor]] instead of a normal direct drive motor. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}
* [[High-volume low-speed fan]]s (HVLS fans) are large-diameter ceiling fans intended for large spaces such as warehouses and gymnasiums.  These fans generally spin at a low speed and they use airfoil-style blades for optimized air movement.  One of the most popular manufactures of HVLS fans is [[Big Ass Fans]].
* Synchronous motor mini ceiling fans- these are relatively small in size and are made almost completely out of plastic.
* [[Punkah]] style ceiling fans. These fans are based on the earliest form of a fan, that was developed in [[India]] which was originally cut from an Indian [[palmyra]] leaf. A punkah fan moves slowly in a pendular manner with a rather large blade and is nowadays electrically powered using a belt-driven system. In comparison to a rotating fan it creates a gentle breeze rather than an airflow.

==Safety concerns with installation==
A typical ceiling fan weighs between 15 and 50 pounds when fully assembled. While many junction boxes can support that weight while the fan is hanging still, a fan ''in operation'' exerts many additional stresses—notably [[Torsion (mechanics)|torsion]]—on the object from which it is hung; this can cause an improper junction box to fail. For this reason, in the United States the [[National Electric Code]] (document [[National Fire Protection Association|NFPA]] 70, Article 314) states that ceiling fans must be supported by an electrical junction box listed for that use. It is a common mistake for homeowners to replace a light fixture with a ceiling fan without upgrading to a proper junction box.

===Low-hanging fans/danger to limbs===
Another concern with installing a ceiling fan relates to the height of the blades relative to the floor. Building codes throughout the United States prohibit residential ceiling fans from being mounted with the blades closer than seven feet from the floor;{{cn|date=April 2016}} this sometimes proves, however, to not be high enough. If a ceiling fan is turned on and a person fully extends his or her arms into the air, as sometimes happens during normal tasks such as stretching or changing bedsheets, it is possible for the blades to strike their hands, potentially causing injury. Also, if one is carrying a long and awkward object, one end may inadvertently enter the path of rotation of a ceiling fan's blades, which can cause damage to the fan. Building codes throughout the United States also prohibit industrial ceiling fans from being mounted with the blades closer than 10 feet from the floor for these reasons.

====''MythBusters'': "Killer Ceiling Fan"====
In 2004, ''[[MythBusters]]'' tested the idea that a ceiling fan is capable of [[decapitation]] if an individual was to stick his or her neck into a running fan. Two versions of the myth were tested, with the first being the "jumping kid", involving a kid jumping up and down on a bed, jumping too high and entering the fan from below and the second being the "lover's leap", involving a husband dressed in a costume, leaping towards his wife in bed and entering the fan side-on. [[Kari Byron]], [[Tory Belleci]] and [[Scottie Chapman]] took the lead on the investigation, though original MythBusters [[Jamie Hyneman]] and [[Adam Savage]] also assisted.

First, Kari and Scottie purchased a regular household fan and also an industrial fan, which has metal blades as opposed to wood and a more powerful motor. They and Tory then fashioned their human analogs - ballistic gel busts of Adam with actual human craniums, pig spines to approximate human spines, and latex arteries filled with fake blood - and then constructed rigs for both scenarios.

They busted the myth in both scenarios with both household and industrial fans, as tests proved that residential ceiling fans are, apparently by design, largely incapable of causing more than minor injury, having low-torque motors that stop quickly when blocked and blades composed of light materials that tend to break easily if impacted at speed (the household fan test of the "lover's leap" scenario actually broke the fan blades.) They did find that industrial fans, with their steel blades and higher speeds, proved capable of causing injury and laceration - building codes require industrial fans to be mounted with blades 10 feet above the floor, and the industrial fan test of the "lover's leap" scenario produced a lethal injury where the fan sliced through the jugular and into the vertebrae - but still lost energy rapidly once blocked and were unable to decapitate the test dummy. As a finale, Scottie, Tory and Kari created an even more dangerous fan with a lawn mower engine as the fan motor and razor sharp blades made from sheet metal in an attempt to duplicate the result, and even it was unable to achieve decapitation, but it caused lethal and horrifying injuries that compelled Adam to put it into the "''MythBusters'' Hall of Fame."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Ming Dynasty Astronaut |episodelink= |url= |accessdate= |series= MythBusters |serieslink= |first1=Adam (co-host) |last1=Savage |first2=Jamie (co-host) |last2=Hyneman |first3=Scottie (Build Team) |last3=Chapman |first4=Tory (Build Team) |last4=Belleci |first5=Kari (Build Team) |last5=Byron |network=Discovery |station= |city= |airdate=December 5, 2004 |began= |ended= |season=2 |seriesno= |number= 24 |minutes= |time=25:45 |timecaption=Begins at |transcript= |transcripturl= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wobble===
Wobbling is usually caused by the weight of fan blades being out of balance with each other. This can happen due to a variety of factors, including blades being warped, blade irons being bent, blades or blade irons not being screwed on straight, or blades being different weights or shapes or sizes. (Minute differences matter.) Also, if all the blades do not exert an equal force on the air (because they have different angles, for instance), the vertical reaction forces can cause wobbling. Wobble can also be caused by a motor flaw, but that very rarely occurs. Wobbling is not affected by the way in which the fan is mounted or the mounting surface.

Contrary to popular misconception, wobbling alone will not cause a ceiling fan to fall.&lt;ref name=InterNACHI&gt;{{cite web |title= Ceiling Fan Inspection |url= http://www.nachi.org/ceiling-fan-inspection.htm |publisher= International Association of Certified Home Inspectors |accessdate= May 31, 2013 |first= Nick |last= Gromicko}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ceiling fans are secured by [[Clevis fastener|clevis pins]] locked with either [[split pin]]s or [[R-clip]]s, so wobbling won't have an effect on the fan's security, unless of course, the pins/clips were not secured. To date, there are no reports of a fan wobbling itself off the ceiling and falling. However, a severe wobble can cause light fixture shades or covers to gradually loosen over time and potentially fall, posing a risk of injury to anyone under the fan, and also from any resulting broken glass. It is also worth mentioning that when the MythBusters were designing a fan with the goal of chopping off someone's head, Scottie used an edge finder to find the exact center of their blades with the aim of eliminating potentially very dangerous wobbling of their steel blades. It is important that, when installing the fan, the installer closely follows the manufacturer's instructions with regard to using proper mounting screws. It is also important that all screws (especially the set screws which hold twist-on downrods in place) be tight, and any ceiling fan light fixtures are properly assembled with their shades and covers securely attached.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="85478">'''Cellulosic ethanol''' is [[ethanol]] (ethyl alcohol) produced from [[cellulose]] (the stringy fiber of a plant) rather than from the plant's [[seed]]s or [[fruit]]. It is a [[biofuel]] produced from [[grass]]es, [[wood]], [[algae]], or other plants. The fibrous parts of the plants are mostly inedible to animals, including humans, except for [[ruminant]]s (grazing, cud-chewing animals such as cows or sheep).

Considerable interest in cellulosic ethanol exists due to its important economical potential. Growth of cellulose by plants is a mechanism that captures and stores [[solar energy]] chemically in nontoxic ways with resultant supplies that are easy to transport and store. Additionally, transport may be unneeded anyway, because grasses or trees can grow almost anywhere temperate. This is why [[cellulosic ethanol commercialization|commercially practical cellulosic ethanol]] is widely viewed as a next level of development for the biofuel industry that could reduce demand for [[oil well|oil and gas drilling]] and even [[nuclear power]] in ways that [[grain]]-based [[ethanol fuel]] alone cannot. Potential exists for the many benefits of carbonaceous liquid fuels and [[petrochemical]]s (which today's [[standard of living]] depends on) but in a [[carbon cycle]]–balanced and [[renewable resource|renewable]] way (recycling surface and atmosphere carbon instead of pumping underground carbon up into it and thus adding to it). Commercially practical cellulosic alcohol could also avoid one of the problems with today's conventional (grain-based) biofuels, which is that they set up competition for grain with food purposes, potentially driving up the price of food. To date, what stands in the way of these goals is that production of cellulosic alcohol is not yet sufficiently practical on a commercial scale.

==Overview==
Cellulosic ethanol is a type of [[biofuel]]  produced from [[Lignocellulosic biomass|lignocellulose]], a structural material that comprises much of the mass of plants. Lignocellulose is composed mainly of [[cellulose]], [[hemicellulose]] and [[lignin]]. [[Corn stover]], ''[[Panicum virgatum]]'' (switchgrass), ''[[Miscanthus]]'' grass species, [[Wood pulp|wood chip]]s and the byproducts of lawn and tree maintenance are some of the more popular cellulosic materials for [[ethanol]] production. Production of ethanol from lignocellulose has the advantage of abundant and diverse raw material compared to sources such as corn and cane sugars, but requires a greater amount of processing to make the sugar monomers available to the microorganisms typically used to produce ethanol by fermentation.

Switchgrass and ''Miscanthus'' are the major biomass materials being studied today, due to their high productivity per acre. Cellulose, however, is contained in nearly every natural, free-growing plant, tree, and bush, in meadows, forests, and fields all over the world without agricultural effort or cost needed to make it grow.

One of the benefits of cellulosic ethanol is it reduces [[greenhouse gas]] emissions (GHG) by 85% over reformulated gasoline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transportation.anl.gov/pdfs/TA/354.pdf Updated Energy and Greenhouse Gas Emissions Results of Fuel Ethanol&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  By contrast, starch ethanol (e.g., from corn), which most frequently uses [[natural gas]] to provide energy for the process, may not reduce GHG emissions at all depending on how the starch-based feedstock is produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.environmentcalifornia.org:443/newsletter/fall07/clean-cars-cool-fuels |title=Clean cars, cool fuels |accessdate=2007-11-28 |publisher=Environment California |volume=5 |issue=2 |year=2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103010613/http://www.environmentcalifornia.org/newsletter/fall07/clean-cars-cool-fuels |archivedate=2007-11-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[National Academy of Sciences]] in 2011, there is no commercially viable bio-refinery in existence to convert lignocellulosic biomass to fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=13105&amp;page=3 | title = Renewable Fuel Standard: Potential Economic and Environmental Effects of U.S. Biofuel Policy | page = 3 of "Summary" | author = National Research Council of the National Academies | year = 2011 | publisher = The National Academies Press | location = Washington, D.C. | isbn = 978-0-309-18751-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Absence of production of cellulosic ethanol in the quantities required by the regulation was the basis of a [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia]] decision announced January 25, 2013, voiding a requirement imposed on car and truck fuel producers in the United States by the Environmental Protection Agency requiring addition of cellulosic biofuels to their products.&lt;ref name=NYT012513&gt;{{cite news|title=Court Overturns E.P.A.’s Biofuels Mandate|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/26/business/energy-environment/court-overturns-epas-biofuels-mandate.html|accessdate=January 26, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 25, 2013|author=Matthew L.

== History ==
The French chemist, Henri Braconnot, was the first to discover that cellulose could be hydrolyzed into sugars by treatment with sulfuric acid in 1819.&lt;ref&gt;Braconnot, H. Annalen der Physik. 1819, 63, 348.&lt;/ref&gt; The hydrolyzed sugar could then be processed to form ethanol through fermentation. The first commercialized ethanol production began in Germany in 1898, where acid was used to hydrolyze cellulose. In the United States, the Standard Alcohol Company opened the first cellulosic ethanol production plant in South Carolina in 1910. Later, a second plant was opened in Louisiana. However, both plants were closed after World War I due to economic reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Solomon|first1=Barry D.|last2=Barnes|first2=Justin R.|last3=Halvorsen|first3=Kathleen E.|title=Grain and cellulosic ethanol: History, economics, and energy policy|journal=Biomass and Bioenergy|date=June 2007|volume=31|issue=6|pages=416–425|doi=10.1016/j.biombioe.2007.01.023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first attempt at commercializing a process for ethanol from wood was done in Germany in 1898. It involved the use of dilute acid to hydrolyze the cellulose to glucose, and was able to produce 7.6 liters of ethanol per 100&amp;nbsp;kg of wood waste ({{convert|18|USgal|L|abbr=on}} per ton). The Germans soon developed an industrial process optimized for yields of around {{convert|50|USgal|L}} per ton of biomass. This process soon found its way to the US, culminating in two commercial plants operating in the southeast during World War I. These plants used what was called "the American Process" — a one-stage dilute sulfuric acid hydrolysis. Though the yields were half that of the original German process ({{convert|25|USgal|L}} of ethanol per ton versus 50), the throughput of the American process was much higher. A drop in lumber production forced the plants to close shortly after the end of World War I. In the meantime, a small but steady amount of research on dilute acid hydrolysis continued at the [[USFS]]'s [[Forest Products Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;Saeman JF. "Kinetics of wood saccharification: Hydrolysis of cellulose and decomposition of sugars in dilute acid at high temperature", ''Industrial and Engineering Chemistry'', 37(1): 43–52 (1945).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris EE, Beglinger E, Hajny GJ, and Sherrard EC. "Hydrolysis of Wood: Treatment with Sulfuric Acid in a stationary digester", ''Industrial and Engineering Chemistry'', 37(1): 12–23 (1945)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conner AH, Lorenz LF. "Kinetic modeling of hardwood prehydrolysis. Part&amp;nbsp;III. Water and dilute acetic acid Prehydrolysis of southern red oak, ''Wood and Fiber Science'', 18(2): 248–263 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; During World War II, the US again turned to cellulosic ethanol, this time for conversion to [[butadiene]] to produce synthetic rubber. The Vulcan Copper and Supply Company was contracted to construct and operate a plant to convert sawdust into ethanol. The plant was based on modifications to the original German Scholler process as developed by the Forest Products Laboratory. This plant achieved an ethanol yield of {{convert|50|USgal|L|abbr=on}} per dry ton, but was still not profitable and was closed after the war.&lt;ref&gt;Katzen, R. and Schell, d.J., "Lignocellulosic feedstock Biorefinery: History and Plant Development for Biomass Hydrolysis", pp 129-138 in Biorefineries - Industrial processes and Products, Volume 1, Kamm, B., Gruber, P.R., and Kamm, M., eds. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the rapid development of enzyme technologies in the last two decades, the acid hydrolysis process has gradually been replaced by enzymatic hydrolysis. Chemical pretreatment of the feedstock is required to prehydrolyze (separate) hemicellulose, so it can be more effectively converted into sugars. The dilute acid pretreatment is developed based on the early work on acid hydrolysis of wood at the [[USFS]]'s [[Forest Products Laboratory]]. Recently, the Forest Products Laboratory together with the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] developed a sulfite pretreatment to overcome the recalcitrance of lignocellulose&lt;ref name=zhu&gt;

US President [[George W. Bush]], in his [[State of the Union]] address delivered January 31, 2006, proposed to expand the use of cellulosic ethanol. In his [[State of the Union Address]] on January 23, 2007, President Bush announced a proposed mandate for {{convert|35|e9USgal|m3}} of ethanol by 2017. It is widely recognized that the maximum production of ethanol from corn starch is {{convert|15|e9USgal|m3}} per year, implying a proposed mandate for production of some {{convert|20|e9USgal|m3}} more per year of cellulosic ethanol by 2017. Bush's proposed plan includes $2 billion funding (from 2007 to 2017?) for cellulosic ethanol plants, with an additional $1.6 billion (from 2007 to 2017?) announced by the USDA on January 27, 2007.

In March 2007, the US government awarded $385 million in grants aimed at jump-starting ethanol production from nontraditional sources like wood chips, switchgrass, and citrus peels. Half of the six projects chosen will use thermochemical methods and half will use cellulosic ethanol methods.&lt;ref&gt;

== Production methods ==
[[File:Pg166 bioreactor.jpg|thumb|right|[[w:Bioreactor|Bioreactor]] for [[w:Cellulosic ethanol|cellulosic ethanol]] research.]]
The two ways of producing ethanol from [[cellulose]] are:
* [[Cellulolysis]] processes which consist of [[hydrolysis]] on pretreated lignocellulosic materials, using [[enzyme]]s to break complex cellulose into simple [[sugars]] such as [[glucose]], followed by [[ethanol fermentation|fermentation]] and [[distillation]].
* [[Gasification]] that transforms the [[lignocellulosic]] raw material into gaseous [[carbon monoxide]] and hydrogen. These gases can be converted to ethanol by fermentation or chemical [[catalysis]].

As is normal for pure ethanol production, these methods include [[distillation]].

=== Cellulolysis (biological approach) ===

The stages to produce ethanol using a biological approach are:&lt;ref name="zhu"/&gt;
# A "pretreatment" phase, to make the lignocellulosic material such as wood or straw amenable to hydrolysis
# Cellulose [[hydrolysis]] (that is, [[cellulose#Breakdown (cellulolysis)|cellulolysis]]) with [[cellulase]]s, to break down the molecules into sugars
# Separation of the sugar solution from the residual materials, notably [[lignin]]
# Microbial fermentation of the sugar solution
# Distillation to produce roughly 95% pure alcohol
# Dehydration by molecular sieves to bring the ethanol concentration to over 99.5%

In 2010, a genetically engineered yeast strain was developed to produce its own cellulose-digesting enzymes.&lt;ref name="N.Crassa"&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Galazka | first1 = J.| last2 = Tian | first2 = C.| last3 = Beeson | first3 = W.| last4 = Martinez | first4 = B.| last5 = Glass | first5 = N.| last6 = Cate | first6 = J.| title = Cellodextrin Transport in Yeast for Improved Biofuel Production| journal = Science| volume = 330| issue = 6000| pages = 84–86| year = 2010| pmid = 20829451| doi = 10.1126/science.1192838|bibcode = 2010Sci...330...84G }}&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming this technology can be scaled to industrial levels, it would eliminate one or more steps of cellulolysis, reducing both the time required and costs of production.

Although lignocellulose is the most abundant plant material resource, its usability is curtailed by its rigid structure. As a result, an effective pretreatment is needed to liberate the cellulose from the lignin seal and its crystalline structure so as to render it accessible for a subsequent hydrolysis step.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mosier N, Wyman C, Dale BE, Elander R, Lee YY, Holtzapple M, Ladisch M | year = 2005 | title = Features of promising technologies for pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass | url = | journal = Bioresour Technol | volume = 96 | issue = 6| pages = 673–686 | doi=10.1016/j.biortech.2004.06.025}}&lt;/ref&gt; By far, most pretreatments are done through physical or chemical means. To achieve higher efficiency, both physical and chemical pretreatments are required. Physical pretreatment is often called size reduction to reduce biomass physical size. Chemical pretreatment is to remove chemical barriers so the enzymes can have access to cellulose for microbial reactions.

To date, the available pretreatment techniques include [[acid hydrolysis]], [[steam explosion]], ammonia fiber expansion, organosolv, [[sulfite process|sulfite pretreatment]],&lt;ref name="zhu"/&gt; AVAP® (SO2-ethanol-water) fractionation,&lt;ref&gt;Iakovlev, M.; van Heiningen, A.

Enzyme Microb Technol 18:312–331.&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of inhibitors will not only further complicate the ethanol production but also increase the cost of production due to entailed detoxification steps. Even though pretreatment by acid hydrolysis is probably the oldest and most studied pretreatment technique, it produces several potent inhibitors including [[furfural]] and hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF) which are by far regarded as the most toxic inhibitors present in lignocellulosic hydrolysate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Palmqvist E, Hahn-Hägerdal B | year = 2000 | title = Fermentation of lignocellulosic hydrolysates.

Most pretreatment processes are not effective when applied to feedstocks with high lignin content, such as forest biomass. [[Organosolv]], SPORL ('sulfite pretreatment to overcome recalcitrance of lignocellulose') and SO2-ethanol-water (AVAP®) processes are the three processes that can achieve over 90% cellulose conversion for forest biomass, especially those of softwood species. SPORL is the most energy efficient (sugar production per unit energy consumption in pretreatment) and robust process for pretreatment of forest biomass with very low production of fermentation inhibitors. Organosolv pulping is particularly effective for hardwoods and offers easy recovery of a hydrophobic lignin product by dilution and precipitation.&lt;ref&gt;Organosolv delignification of willow (2010), AL Macfarlane, MM Farid, JJJ Chen, Lambert Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-3-8383-9155-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; AVAP® process effectively fractionates all types of lignocellulosics into clean highly digestible cellulose, undegraded hemicellulose sugars, reactive lignin and lignosulfonates, and is characterized by efficient recovery of chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;Iakovlev M.

There are two major cellulose hydrolysis (cellulolysis) processes: a chemical reaction using acids, or an [[enzyme|enzymatic]] reaction use [[cellulase]]s.

==== Cellulolytic processes ====
The [[cellulose]] molecules are composed of long chains of sugar molecules. In the [[hydrolysis]] of cellulose (that is, [[cellulose#Breakdown (cellulolysis)|cellulolysis]]), these chains are broken down to free the sugar before it is fermented for alcohol production.

===== Chemical hydrolysis =====
In the traditional methods developed in the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century, hydrolysis is performed by attacking the cellulose with an acid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journeytoforever.org/biofuel_library/wood_alcohol.html Wood Alcohol]. Translation from E. Boullanger: Distillerie Agricole et Industrielle (Paris: Ballière, 1924).&lt;/ref&gt; Dilute acid may be used under high heat and high pressure, or more concentrated acid can be used at lower temperatures and atmospheric pressure. A decrystalized cellulosic mixture of acid and sugars reacts in the presence of water to complete individual sugar molecules (hydrolysis). The product from this hydrolysis is then neutralized and yeast fermentation is used to produce ethanol. As mentioned, a significant obstacle to the dilute acid process is that the hydrolysis is so harsh that toxic degradation products are produced that can interfere with fermentation. [[BlueFire Renewables]] uses concentrated acid because it does not produce nearly as many fermentation inhibitors, but must be separated from the sugar stream for recycle [simulated moving bed (SMB) chromatographic separation, for example] to be commercially attractive.

[[Agricultural Research Service]] scientists found they can access and ferment almost all of the remaining sugars in [[wheat]] straw. The sugars are located in the plant’s cell walls, which are notoriously difficult to break down. To access these sugars, scientists pretreated the wheat straw with alkaline peroxide, and then used specialized enzymes to break down the cell walls. This method produced {{convert|93|USgal|L}} of ethanol per ton of wheat straw.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/pr/2010/100409.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Enzymatic hydrolysis =====
Cellulose chains can be broken into [[glucose]] molecules by [[cellulase]] [[enzyme]]s.

This reaction occurs at body temperature in the stomachs of [[ruminant]]s such as cattle and sheep, where the enzymes are produced by microbes. This process uses several enzymes at various stages of this conversion. Using a similar enzymatic system, lignocellulosic materials can be enzymatically hydrolyzed at a relatively mild condition (50&amp;nbsp;°C and pH 5), thus enabling effective cellulose breakdown without the formation of byproducts that would otherwise inhibit enzyme activity. All major pretreatment methods, including dilute acid, require an enzymatic hydrolysis step to achieve high sugar yield for ethanol fermentation.&lt;ref name="lynd"/&gt;
Currently, most pretreatment studies have been laboratory-based, but companies are exploring means to transition from the laboratory to pilot, or production scale.

Various enzyme companies have also contributed significant technological breakthroughs in cellulosic ethanol through the mass production of enzymes for hydrolysis at competitive prices.

The [[fungus]] ''[[Trichoderma reesei]]'' is used by [[Iogen Corporation]] to secrete "specially engineered enzymes" for an enzymatic [[hydrolysis]] process.&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their raw material (wood or straw) has to be pre-treated to make it amenable to hydrolysis.

Another Canadian company, SunOpta, uses [[steam explosion]] pretreatment, providing its technology to Verenium (formerly Celunol Corporation)'s facility in [[Jennings, Louisiana]], Abengoa's facility in [[Salamanca, Spain]], and a China Resources Alcohol Corporation in [[Zhaodong]]. The CRAC production facility uses [[corn stover]] as raw material.&lt;ref&gt;[http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=82712&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;t=Regular&amp;id=951516 "Sunopta updates current cellulosic ethanol projects"]. Sunopta press release, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Genencor]] and [[Novozymes]] have received United States Department of Energy funding for research into reducing the cost of cellulases, key enzymes in the production of cellulosic ethanol by enzymatic hydrolysis. A recent breakthrough in this regard was the discovery and inclusion of ''lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases''. These enzymes are capable of boosting significantly the action of other cellulases by oxidatively attacking a polysaccharide substrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frandsen|first=Kristian E H|last2=Simmons|first2=Thomas J|last3=Dupree|first3=Paul|last4=Poulsen|first4=Jens-Christian N|last5=Hemsworth|first5=Glyn R|last6=Ciano|first6=Luisa|last7=Johnston|first7=Esther M|last8=Tovborg|first8=Morten|last9=Johansen|first9=Katja S|title=The molecular basis of polysaccharide cleavage by lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nchembio.2029|journal=Nature Chemical Biology|doi=10.1038/nchembio.2029|volume=12|issue=4|pages=298–303|pmid=26928935|pmc=4817220|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other enzyme companies, such as [[Dyadic International]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dyadic.com/ Dyadic International (DYAI)]&lt;/ref&gt; are developing genetically engineered [[fungi]] which would produce large volumes of [[cellulase]], [[xylanase]] and [[hemicellulase]] enzymes, which can be used to convert agricultural residues such as corn stover, distiller grains, wheat straw and sugarcane [[bagasse]] and [[energy crop]]s such as [[switchgrass]] into fermentable sugars which may be used to produce cellulosic ethanol.

In 2010, BP Biofuels bought out the cellulosic ethanol venture share of [[Verenium Corporation|Verenium]], which had itself been formed by the merger of [[Diversa]] and Celunol, and with which it jointly owned and operated a {{convert|1.4|e6USgal|m3|adj=on}} per year demonstration plant in Jennings, LA, and the laboratory facilities and staff in San Diego, CA. BP Biofuels continues to operate these facilities, and has begun first phases to construct commercial facilities. Ethanol produced in the Jennings facility was shipped to London and blended with gasoline to provide fuel for the Olympics.

[[KL Energy Corporation]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.klenergycorp.com Blue Sugars&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; formerly KL Process Design Group, began commercial operation of a {{convert|1.5|e6USgal|m3|adj=on}} per year cellulosic ethanol facility in Upton, WY in the last quarter of 2007. The Western Biomass Energy facility is currently achieving yields of {{convert|40|-|45|USgal|L}} per dry ton. It is the first operating commercial cellulosic ethanol facility in the nation. The KL Energy process uses a thermomechanical breakdown and enzymatic conversion process. The primary feedstock is soft wood, but lab tests have already proven the KL Energy process on wine pomace, sugarcane bagasse, municipal solid waste, and switchgrass.

==== Microbial fermentation ====
{{Main|Ethanol fermentation}}

Traditionally, baker’s yeast (''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]''), has long been used in the brewery industry to produce ethanol from [[hexose]]s (six-carbon sugars). Due to the complex nature of the [[carbohydrate]]s present in [[lignocellulosic biomass]], a significant amount of [[xylose]] and [[arabinose]] (five-carbon sugars derived from the hemicellulose portion of the lignocellulose) is also present in the hydrolysate. For example, in the hydrolysate of [[corn stover]], approximately 30% of the total fermentable sugars is xylose. As a result, the ability of the fermenting microorganisms to use the whole range of sugars available from the hydrolysate is vital to increase the economic competitiveness of cellulosic ethanol and potentially biobased proteins.

In recent years, [[metabolic engineering]] for microorganisms used in fuel ethanol production has shown significant progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jeffries TW, Jin YS | year = 2004 | title = Metabolic engineering for improved fermentation of pentoses by yeasts | url = | journal = Appl Microbiol Biotechnol | volume = 63 | issue = 5| pages = 495–509 | doi = 10.1007/s00253-003-1450-0 | pmid = 14595523 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'', microorganisms such as ''Zymomonas mobilis'' and ''Escherichia coli'' have been targeted through metabolic engineering for cellulosic ethanol production.

Recently, engineered yeasts have been described efficiently fermenting xylose,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brat D, Boles E, Wiedemann B | year = 2009 | title = Functional expression of a bacterila xylose isomerase in Saccharomyces cerevisie | journal = Appl.

Microb Cell Fact. 10;5:18.&lt;/ref&gt; Yeast cells are especially attractive for cellulosic ethanol processes because they have been used in biotechnology for hundreds of years, are tolerant to high ethanol and inhibitor concentrations and can grow at low pH values to reduce bacterial contamination.

==== Combined hydrolysis and fermentation ====
Some species of bacteria have been found capable of direct conversion of a cellulose substrate into ethanol. One example is ''[[Clostridium thermocellum]]'', which uses a complex [[cellulosome]] to break down cellulose and synthesize ethanol. However, ''C.&amp;nbsp;thermocellum'' also produces other products during cellulose metabolism, including [[acetate]] and [[lactic acid|lactate]], in addition to ethanol, lowering the efficiency of the process. Some research efforts are directed to optimizing ethanol production by [[genetic engineering|genetically engineering]] bacteria that focus on the ethanol-producing pathway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rochester.edu/news/show.php?id=2803 University of Rochester Press Release:] Genome Sequencing Reveals Key to Viable Ethanol Production&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gasification process (thermochemical approach) ===
[[File:Holzvergaser Güssing.jpg|thumb|200px|Fluidized Bed Gasifier in [[Güssing]] [[Burgenland]] [[Austria]]]]
The gasification process does not rely on chemical decomposition of the cellulose chain (cellulolysis). Instead of breaking the cellulose into sugar molecules, the carbon in the raw material is converted into [[synthesis gas]], using what amounts to partial combustion. The carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and hydrogen may then be fed into a special kind of [[Syngas fermentation|fermenter]]. Instead of sugar fermentation with yeast, [[Syngas fermentation|this process]] uses ''[[Clostridium ljungdahlii]]'' bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brienergy.com/index.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060421183908/http://www.brienergy.com/index.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-04-21 |title=Providing for a Sustainable Energy Future by producing clean RENEWABLE liquid energy and green power |accessdate=2007-11-28 |publisher=Bioengineering Resources Inc. }}&lt;/ref&gt; This microorganism will ingest carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and hydrogen and produce ethanol and water. The process can thus be broken into three steps:
# [[Gasification]] — Complex carbon-based molecules are broken apart to access the carbon as carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and hydrogen 
# Fermentation — Convert the carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and hydrogen into ethanol using the ''Clostridium ljungdahlii'' organism
# Distillation — Ethanol is separated from water

A recent study has found another ''Clostridium'' bacterium that seems to be twice as efficient in making ethanol from carbon monoxide as the one mentioned above.&lt;ref&gt;"Formation of Ethanol from Carbon Monoxide via New Microbial Catalyst", ''Biomass &amp; Energy'' v. 23 (2002), p. 487–493.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, the synthesis gas from gasification may be fed to a catalytic reactor where it is used to produce ethanol and other higher alcohols through a thermochemical process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.powerenergy.com/ |title=Power Energy Fuels Homepage |publisher=Power Energy Fuels, Inc. |accessdate=2007-11-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212011334/http://www.powerenergy.com/ |archivedate=2007-12-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This process can also generate other types of liquid fuels, an alternative concept successfully demonstrated by the Montreal-based company [[Enerkem]] at their facility in Westbury, Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enerkem.com/en/our-locations/plants/westbury-quebec-canada.html |title=Westbury, Quebec |accessdate=2011-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806232704/http://www.enerkem.com/en/our-locations/plants/westbury-quebec-canada.html |archivedate=2011-08-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hemicellulose to ethanol==

Studies are intensively conducted to develop economic methods to convert both cellulose and [[hemicellulose]] to ethanol. Fermentation of glucose, the main product of cellulose hydrolyzate, to ethanol is an already established and efficient technique. However, conversion of xylose, the pentose sugar of hemicellulose hydrolyzate, is a limiting factor, especially in the presence of glucose. Moreover, it cannot be disregarded as hemicellulose will increase the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of cellulosic ethanol production.&lt;ref name="Sakamoto, T. 2012"&gt;Sakamoto, T.; Hasunuma, T.; Hori, Y.; Yamada, R.; Kondo, A. Direct ethanol production from hemicellulosic materials of rice straw by use of an engineered yeast strain codisplaying three types of hemicellulolytic enzymes on the surface of xylose-utilizing Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. J. Biotechnol. 2012, 158, 203-210.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sakamoto (2012) et al. show the potential of genetic engineering microbes to express hemicellulase enzymes. The researchers created a recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain that was able to:

# hydrolyze hemicellulase through codisplaying endoxylanase on its cell surface,
# assimilate xylose by expression of xylose reductase and xylitol dehydrogenase.

The strain was able to convert rice straw hydrolyzate to ethanol, which contains hemicellulosic components. Moreover, it was able to produce 2.5x more ethanol than the control strain, showing the highly effective process of cell surface-engineering to produce ethanol.&lt;ref name="Sakamoto, T. 2012"/&gt;

==Economics==
The shift to a renewable fuel resource has been a target for many years now. However, most of its production is with the use of [[corn ethanol]]. In the year 2000, only 6.2 billion liters were produced in the United States, but this number has expanded over 800% to 50 billion litres in just a decade (2010).&lt;ref&gt;Deepak, K., &amp; Ganti, M. Impact of pretreatment and downstream processing technologies on economics and energy in cellulosic ethanol production. Biotechnology for Biofuels, 4&lt;/ref&gt; Government pressures to shift to renewable fuel resources have been apparent since the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency implemented the 2007 Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which required that a certain percentage of renewable fuel be included in fuel products. The shift to cellulosic ethanol production from corn ethanol has been strongly promoted by the US government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/10/business/energy-environment/companies-face-fines-for-not-using-unavailable-biofuel.html?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=Matthew L. | last=Wald | title=Companies Face Fines for Not Using Unavailable Biofuel | date=2012-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even with these policies in place and the government's attempts to create a market for cellulose ethanol, there was no commercial production of this fuel in 2010 and 2011.&lt;ref name="technologyreview.com"&gt;[http://www.technologyreview.com/news/427874/us-will-be-hard-pressed-to-meet-its-biofuel-mandates/ U.S. Will Be Hard-Pressed to Meet Its Biofuel Mandates | MIT Technology Review&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Energy Independence and Security Act originally set goals of 100 million, 250 million, and 500 million gallons for the years 2010, 2011, and 2012 respectively. However, as of 2012 it was projected that the production of cellulosic ethanol would be approximately 10.5 million gallons--far from its target.&lt;ref name="technologyreview.com"/&gt; In 2007 alone, the US government provided 1 billion US dollars for cellulosic ethanol projects, while China invested 500 million US dollars into cellulosic ethanol research.&lt;ref name="Sainz, M. B. 2011"&gt;Sainz, M. B. (2011). Commercial cellulosic ethanol: the role of plant-expressed enzymes. Biofuels, 237-264.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the lack of existing commercialized plant data, it is difficult to determine the exact method of production that will be most commonly employed. Model systems try to compare different technologies' costs, but these models cannot be applied to commercial-plant costs. Currently, there are many pilot and demonstration facilities open that exhibit cellulosic production on a smaller scale. These main facilities are summarized in the [[Cellulosic ethanol#Cellulosic ethanol commercialization|table below]].

Start-up costs for pilot scale lignocellulosic ethanol plants are high. On 28 February 2007, the [[United States Department of Energy|U.S. Department of Energy]] announced $385 million in grant funding to six cellulosic ethanol plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doe.gov/news/4827.htm |title=DOE Selects Six Cellulosic Ethanol Plants for Up to $385 Million in Federal Funding |publisher=[[United States Department of Energy]] |date=2007-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304091902/http://www.doe.gov/news/4827.htm |archivedate=2007-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This grant funding accounts for 40% of the investment costs. The remaining 60% comes from the promoters of those facilities. Hence, a total of $1&amp;nbsp;billion will be invested for approximately {{convert|140|e6USgal|m3|adj=on}} capacity. This translates into $7/annual gallon production capacity in capital investment costs for pilot plants; future capital costs are expected to be lower. [[Corn-to-ethanol]] plants cost roughly $1–3/annual gallon capacity, though the cost of the corn itself is considerably greater than for [[switchgrass]] or waste biomass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/biomass/pdfs/37092.pdf|format=PDF |title=Feasibility Study for Co-Locating and Integrating Ethanol Production Plants from Corn Starch and Lignocellulosic Feedstocks |publisher=United States Department of Energy |date=January 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715142512/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/biomass/pdfs/37092.pdf |archivedate=2007-07-15 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethanol-gec.org/information/briefing/16.pdf |format=PDF |title=Determining the Cost of Producing Ethanol from Corn Starch and Lignocellulosic Feedstocks |publisher=U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Department of Energy|date=October 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2007, ethanol is produced mostly from sugars or starches, obtained from fruits and grains. In contrast, cellulosic ethanol is obtained from cellulose, the main component of wood, straw, and much of the structure of plants. Since cellulose cannot be digested by humans, the production of cellulose does not compete with the production of food, other than conversion of land from food production to cellulose production (which has recently started to become an issue, due to rising wheat prices.) The price per ton of the raw material is thus much cheaper than that of grains or fruits. Moreover, since cellulose is the main component of plants, the whole plant can be harvested. This results in much better yields—up to {{convert|10|ST/acre}}, instead of 4-5 short tons/acre (9–11&amp;nbsp;t/ha) for the best crops of grain.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

The raw material is plentiful. An estimated 323 million tons of cellulose-containing raw materials which could be used to create ethanol are thrown away each year in US alone. This includes 36.8 million dry tons of urban wood wastes, 90.5 million dry tons of primary mill residues, 45 million dry tons of forest residues, and 150.7&amp;nbsp;million dry tons of corn stover and wheat straw.&lt;ref name="Resource Estimates"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bioenergy.ornl.gov/papers/misc/resource_estimates.html |title=Biomass Resource Estimates |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209194101/http://bioenergy.ornl.gov/papers/misc/resource_estimates.html |archivedate=2008-02-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Transforming them into ethanol using efficient and cost-effective hemi(cellulase) enzymes or other processes might provide as much as 30% of the current fuel consumption in the United States.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Moreover, even land marginal for agriculture could be planted with cellulose-producing crops, such as switchgrass, resulting in enough production to substitute for all the current oil imports into the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Paper, cardboard, and packaging comprise a substantial part of the solid waste sent to [[landfills]] in the United States each day, 41.26% of all organic [[municipal solid waste]] (MSW) according to [[California Integrated Waste Management Board]]'s city profiles. {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} &lt;!-- Unable to find searching http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/ --&gt; These city profiles account for accumulation of {{convert|612.3|ST}} daily per landfill where an average population density of 2,413 per square mile persists. &lt;!-- Organic waste consists of 0.4%&amp;nbsp;manure, 1.6%&amp;nbsp;gypsum board, 4.2%&amp;nbsp;glossy paper, 4.2%&amp;nbsp;paper ledger, 9.2%&amp;nbsp;wood, 10.5%&amp;nbsp;envelopes, 11.9%&amp;nbsp;newsprint, 12.3%&amp;nbsp;grass and leaves, 30.0%&amp;nbsp;food scrap, 34.0%&amp;nbsp;office paper, 35.2%&amp;nbsp;corrugated cardboard, and 46.4%&amp;nbsp;agricultural composites, makes up 71.51% of landfill. --&gt; All these, except gypsum board, contain cellulose, which is transformable into cellulosic ethanol.&lt;ref name="Resource Estimates"/&gt;  This may have additional environmental benefits because decomposition of these products produces [[methane]], a potent greenhouse gas.&lt;ref&gt;''[[National Geographic Magazine]]'', 'Carbon's New Math', October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Reduction of the disposal of solid waste through cellulosic ethanol conversion would reduce solid waste disposal costs by local and state governments. It is estimated that each person in the US throws away {{convert|4.4|lb|abbr=on}} of trash each day, of which 37% contains waste paper, which is largely cellulose. That computes to 244&amp;nbsp;thousand tons per day of discarded waste paper that contains cellulose.&lt;ref&gt;[300 million people × {{convert|4.4|lb|abbr=on}} per person × 37% is paper / 2000 lb per ton]&lt;/ref&gt; The raw material to produce cellulosic ethanol is not only free, it has a negative cost—i.e., ethanol producers can get paid to take it away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.des.state.nh.us/SWPlan/SWGeneration.pdf |format=PDF |title=Solid Waste Generation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2006, a U.S. Senate hearing was told the current cost of producing cellulosic ethanol is US $2.25 per US gallon (US $0.59/litre), primarily due to the current poor conversion efficiency.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} &lt;!-- the following blog ref is not within Wikipedia standards for reference.

However, the Department of Energy is optimistic and has requested a doubling of research funding. The same Senate hearing was told the research target was to reduce the cost of production to US $1.07 per US gallon (US $0.28/litre) by 2012. "The production of cellulosic ethanol represents not only a step toward true energy diversity for the country, but a very cost-effective alternative to fossil fuels. It is advanced weaponry in the war on oil," said [[Vinod Khosla]], managing partner of [[Khosla Ventures]], who recently told a Reuters Global Biofuels Summit that he could see cellulosic fuel prices sinking to $1&amp;nbsp;per gallon within ten years.

In September 2010, a report by [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] analyzed the [[Europe]]an biomass infrastructure and future refinery development. Estimated prices for a litre of ethanol in August 2010 are EUR 0.51 for 1g and 0.71 for 2g.{{clarify|units|date=June 2012}} The report suggested Europe should copy the current US subsidies of up to $50 per dry tonne.&lt;ref name="novobl"&gt;Boyle, Harry et al.

Recently on October 25, 2012, BP, one of the leaders in fuel products, announced the cancellation of their proposed $350 million commercial-scale plant. It was estimated that the plant would be producing 36 million gallons a year at its location in Highlands County of Florida. BP has still provided 500 million US dollars for biofuel research at the Energy Biosciences Institute.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://www.technologyreview.com/news/506666/bp-plant-cancellation-darkens-cellulosic-ethanols-future/ A Canceled BP Plant Calls into Question Cellulosic Ethanol Economics | MIT Technology Review&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; General Motors (GM) has also invested into cellulosic companies more specifically Mascoma and Coskata.&lt;ref name="Sainz, M.

Also, since 2013, the Brazilian company GranBio is working to become a producer of biofuels and biochemicals. The family-held company is commissioning an 82 million liters per year (22 MMgy) cellulosic ethanol plant (2G ethanol) in the state of Alagoas, Brazil, which will be the first industrial facility of the group.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/RonDavisPress/reportagem-granbio-folha-de-sp-092013&lt;/ref&gt; GranBio's second generation ethanol facility is integrated to a first generation ethanol plant operated by Grupo Carlos Lyra, uses process technology from Beta Renewables, enzymes from Novozymes and yeast from DSM. Breaking ground in January 2013, the plant is in final commissioning. According to GranBio Annual Financial Records, the total investment was 208 million US Dollars.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/RonDavisPress/balano-contbil-granbio-2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enzyme-cost barrier==
Cellulases and hemicellulases used in the production of cellulosic ethanol are more expensive compared to their first generation counterparts. Enzymes required for maize grain ethanol production cost 2.64-5.28 US dollars per cubic meter of ethanol produced. Enzymes for cellulosic ethanol production are projected to cost 79.25 US dollars, meaning they are 20-40 times more expensive.&lt;ref name="Sainz, M. B. 2011"/&gt; The cost differences are attributed to quantity required. The cellulase family of enzymes have a one to two order smaller magnitude of efficiency. Therefore, it requires 40 to 100 times more of the enzyme to be present in its production. For each ton of biomass it requires 15-25 kilograms of enzyme.&lt;ref name="Yang, B. 2007"&gt;Yang, B., &amp; Wyman, C. E. (2007). Pretreatment: the key to unlocking low‐cost cellulosic ethanol. Biofuels, Bioproducts and Biorefining, 2(1), 26-40.&lt;/ref&gt; More recent estimates&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Eric|date=18 Feb 2016|title=Integrated enzyme production lowers the cost of cellulosic ethanol|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bbb.1634/full|journal=Biofuels, Bioproducts &amp; Biorefining|doi=10.1002/bbb.1634|pmid=|access-date=3 June 2016|volume=10|issue=2|pages=164–174}}&lt;/ref&gt; are lower, suggesting 1&amp;nbsp;kg of enzyme per dry tonne of biomass feedstock. There is also relatively high capital costs associated with the long incubation times for the vessel that perform enzymatic hydrolysis. Altogether, enzymes comprise a significant portion of 20-40% for cellulosic ethanol production. A recent paper&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; estimates the range at 13-36% of cash costs, with a key factor being how the cellulase enzyme is produced. For cellulase produced offsite, enzyme production amounts to 36% of cash cost. For enzyme produced onsite in a separate plant, the fraction is 29%; for integrated enzyme production, the faction is 13%. One of the key benefits of integrated production is that biomass instead of glucose is the enzyme growth medium. Biomass costs less, and it makes the resulting cellulosic ethanol a 100% second-generation biofuel, i.e., it uses no ‘food for fuel’.

==Feedstocks==
In general there are two types of feedstocks: '''forest (woody) Biomass''' and '''agricultural biomass'''. In the US, about 1.4 billion dry tons of biomass can be sustainably produced annually. About 370 million tons or 30% are forest biomass.&lt;ref&gt;Perlack, et al. 2005. Biomass as feedstock for a bioenergy and bioproducts Industry: the technical feasibility of a billion-ton annual supply. Oar Ridge National Laboratory Report ORNL/TM-2005/66, US Dept. of Energy, Oak Ridge, TN&lt;/ref&gt;   Forest biomass has higher cellulose and lignin content and lower hemicellulose and ash content than agricultural biomass. Because of the difficulties and low ethanol yield in fermenting pretreatment hydrolysate, especially those with very high 5 carbon hemicellulose sugars such as xylose, forest biomass has significant advantages over agricultural biomass. Forest biomass also has high density which significantly reduces transportation cost. It can be harvested year around which eliminates long term storage. The close to zero ash content of forest biomass significantly reduces dead load in transportation and processing. To meet the needs for biodiversity, forest biomass will be an important biomass feedstock supply mix in the future biobased economy. However, forest biomass is much more recalcitrant than agricultural biomass. Recently, the [[Forest Products Laboratory|USDA Forest Products Laboratory]] together with the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] developed efficient technologies&lt;ref name="zhu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

[[Woodchips]] from slashes and tree tops and [[saw dust]] from saw mills, and [[Paper#Deinked pulp|waste paper pulp]] are common forest biomass feedstocks for cellulosic ethanol production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technologyreview.com/Energy/21347/?nlid=1325 Better Bug to Make Cellulosic Ethanol | MIT Technology Review&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The following are a few examples of agricultural biomass:

'''Switchgrass''' (''[[Panicum virgatum]]'') is a native [[tallgrass prairie]] grass. Known for its hardiness and rapid growth, this perennial grows during the warm months to heights of 2–6&amp;nbsp;feet. Switchgrass can be grown in most parts of the United States, including swamplands, plains, streams, and along the shores &amp; ''interstate highways''. It is ''self-seeding'' (no tractor for sowing, only for mowing), resistant to many diseases and pests, &amp; can produce high yields with low applications of fertilizer and other chemicals. It is also tolerant to poor soils, flooding, &amp; drought; improves soil quality and prevents erosion due its type of root system.&lt;ref name="Rinehart"&gt;
{{cite web |author=Rinehart, L.
 |year=2006
 |title=Switchgrass as a Bioenergy Crop. National Sustainable Agriculture Information Service

 | accessdate=2007-12-10
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Switchgrass is an approved cover crop for land protected under the federal [[Conservation Reserve Program]] (CRP). CRP is a government program that pays producers a fee for not growing crops on land on which crops recently grew. This program reduces soil erosion, enhances water quality, and increases wildlife habitat. CRP land serves as a habitat for upland game, such as pheasants and ducks, and a number of insects. Switchgrass for biofuel production has been considered for use on Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) land, which could increase ecological sustainability and lower the cost of the CRP program. However, CRP rules would have to be modified to allow this economic use of the CRP land.&lt;ref name="Rinehart"/&gt;

'''Miscanthus × giganteus''' is another viable feedstock for cellulosic ethanol production. This species of grass is native to Asia and is the sterile triploid hybrid of ''[[Miscanthus sinensis]]'' and ''[[Miscanthus sacchariflorus]]''. It can grow up to {{convert|12|ft|m}} tall with little water or fertilizer input. Miscanthus is similar to switchgrass with respect to cold and drought tolerance and water use efficiency. Miscanthus is commercially grown in the European Union as a combustible energy source.

'''Corn cobs''' and '''corn stover''' are the most popular agricultural biomass.

It has been suggested that [[Kudzu]] may become a valuable source of biomass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lugar RG, Woolsey RJ | year = 1999 | title = The New Petroleum | url = | journal = Foreign Affairs | volume = 78 | issue = 1| page = 88 | doi=10.2307/20020241| jstor = 20020241 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental effects==
The environmental impact from the production of fuels is an important factor in determining its feasibility as an alternative to fossil fuels. Over the long run, small differences in production cost, environmental ramifications, and energy output may have large effects. It has been found that cellulosic ethanol can produce a positive net energy output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Farrell AE, Plevin RJ, Turner BT, Jones AD, O'Hare M, Kammen DM | year = 2006 | title = Ethanol can contribute to energy and environmental goals | url = | journal = Science | volume = 311 | issue = 5760| pages = 506–508 | doi=10.1126/science.1121416 | pmid=16439656| bibcode = 2006Sci...311..506F}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reduction in green house gas (GHG) emissions from corn ethanol and cellulosic ethanol compared with fossil fuels is drastic. Corn ethanol may reduce overall GHG emissions by about 13%, while that figure is around 88% or greater for cellulosic ethanol.&lt;ref name="Huanga, H. 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Huanga H, Ramaswamya S, Al-Dajania W, Tschirnera U, Cairncrossb RA | year = 2009 | title = Effect of biomass species and plant size on cellulosic ethanol: A comparative process and economic analysis | url = | journal = Biomass Bioenergy | volume = 33 | issue = 2| pages = 234–246 | doi=10.1016/j.biombioe.2008.05.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wanga MQ, Han J, Haq Z, Tyner WE, Wua M, Elgowainy A | year = 2011 | title = Energy and greenhouse gas emission effects of corn and cellulosic ethanol with technology improvements and land use changes | url = | journal = Biomass Bioenergy | volume = 35 | issue = 5| pages = 1885–1896 | doi=10.1016/j.biombioe.2011.01.028}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well, cellulosic ethanol can reduce carbon dioxide emissions to nearly zero.&lt;ref name="Solomon, B. D. 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Solomon BD, Barnes JR, Halvorson KE | year = 2007 | title = History, economics, and energy policy | url = | journal = Biomass Bioenergy | volume = 31 | issue = 6| pages = 416–425 | doi=10.1016/j.biombioe.2007.01.023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Croplands==
A major concern for the viability of current alternative fuels is the cropland needed to produce the required materials. For example, the production of corn for corn ethanol fuel competes with cropland that may be used for food growth and other feedstocks.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, L. R. Plan B 2.0: rescuing a plant under stress and a civilization in trouble. New York, USA: W.W. Norton &amp; Company; 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between this and cellulosic ethanol production is that cellulosic material is widely available and is derived from a large resource of things. Some crops used for cellulosic ethanol production include switchgrass, corn stover, and hybrid poplar.&lt;ref name="Huanga, H. 2009"/&gt; These crops are fast-growing and can be grown on many types of land which makes them more versatile. Cellulosic ethanol can also be made from wood residues (chips and sawdust), municipal solid waste such as trash or garbage, paper and sewage sludge, cereal straws and grasses.&lt;ref name="Solomon, B. D. 2007"/&gt; It is particularly the non-edible portions of plant material which are used to make cellulosic ethanol, which also minimizes the potential cost of using food products in production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vasudevan PT, Gagnon MD, Briggs MS | year = | title = Environmentally Sustainable Biofuels – The Case for Biodiesel, Biobutanol and Cellulosic Ethanol | url = | journal = Sustainable Biotechnology | volume = 2010 | issue = | pages = 43–62 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effectiveness of growing crops for the purpose of biomass can vary tremendously depending on the geographical location of the plot. For example, factors such as precipitation and sunlight exposure may greatly effect the energy input required to maintain the crops, and therefore effect the overall energy output.&lt;ref name="Schmer, M. R. 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schmer MR, Vogel KP, Mitchell RB, Perrin RK | year = 2008 | title = Net energy of cellulosic ethanol from switchgrass | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA | volume = 105 | issue = 2| pages = 464–469 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0704767105 | pmid=18180449 | pmc=2206559| bibcode=2008PNAS..105..464S }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study done over five years showed that growing and managing switchgrass exclusively as a biomass energy crop can produce 500% or more renewable energy than is consumed during production.&lt;ref name="Schmer, M. R. 2008"/&gt; The levels of GHG emissions and carbon dioxide were also drastically decreased from using cellulosic ethanol compared with traditional gasoline.

In 2008, there was only a small amount of switchgrass dedicated for ethanol production. In order for it to be grown on a large-scale production it must compete with existing uses of agricultural land, mainly for the production of crop commodities. Of the United States' 2.26&amp;nbsp;billion acres (9.1&amp;nbsp;million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of unsubmerged land,&lt;ref&gt;The World Fact Book, www.cia.org, 01 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; 33% are forestland, 26% pastureland and grassland, and 20% crop land. A study done by the U.S. Departments of Energy and Agriculture in 2005 determined whether there were enough available land resources to sustain production of over 1&amp;nbsp;billion dry tons of biomass annually to replace 30% or more of the nation’s current use of liquid transportation fuels. The study found that there could be 1.3&amp;nbsp;billion dry tons of biomass available for ethanol use, by making little changes in agricultural and forestry practices and meeting the demands for forestry products, food, and fiber.&lt;ref name="usdoe1"&gt;

{{POV|section|date=October 2013}}
Currently, corn is easier and less expensive to process into ethanol in comparison to cellulosic ethanol. The Department of Energy estimates that it costs about $2.20 per gallon to produce cellulosic ethanol, which is twice as much as ethanol from corn. Enzymes that destroy plant cell wall tissue cost 30 to 50&amp;nbsp;cents per gallon of ethanol compared to 3&amp;nbsp;cents per gallon for corn.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} The Department of Energy hopes to reduce production cost to $1.07 per gallon by 2012 to be effective. However, cellulosic biomass is cheaper to produce than corn, because it requires fewer inputs, such as energy, fertilizer, herbicide, and is accompanied by less soil erosion and improved soil fertility. Additionally, nonfermentable and unconverted solids left after making ethanol can be burned to provide the fuel needed to operate the conversion plant and produce electricity. Energy used to run corn-based ethanol plants is derived from coal and natural gas. The [[Institute for Local Self-Reliance]] estimates the cost of cellulosic ethanol from the first generation of commercial plants will be in the $1.90–$2.25 per gallon range, excluding incentives. This compares to the current cost of $1.20–$1.50 per gallon for ethanol from corn and the current retail price of over $4.00 per gallon for regular gasoline (which is subsidized and taxed).&lt;ref name="Putting the Pieces Together:Commercializing Ethanol from Cellulose"&gt;

Cellulose is not used for food and can be grown in all parts of the world. The entire plant can be used when producing cellulosic ethanol. Switchgrass yields twice as much ethanol per acre than corn.&lt;ref name="grist.org"/&gt;  Therefore, less land is needed for production and thus less habitat fragmentation. Biomass materials require fewer inputs, such as fertilizer, herbicides, and other chemicals that can pose risks to wildlife. Their extensive roots improve soil quality, reduce erosion, and increase nutrient capture. Herbaceous energy crops reduce soil erosion by greater than 90%, when compared to conventional commodity crop production. This can translate into improved water quality for rural communities. Additionally, herbaceous energy crops add organic material to depleted soils and can increase soil carbon, which can have a direct effect on climate change, as soil carbon can absorb carbon dioxide in the air.&lt;ref name="nelson"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;   As compared to commodity crop production, biomass reduces surface runoff and nitrogen transport. Switchgrass provides an environment for diverse wildlife habitation, mainly insects and ground birds. Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) land is composed of perennial grasses, which are used for cellulosic ethanol, and may be available for use.

For years American farmers have practiced row cropping, with crops such as sorghum and corn. Because of this, much is known about the effect of these practices on wildlife. The most significant effect of increased corn ethanol would be the additional land that would have to be converted to agricultural use and the increased erosion and fertilizer use that goes along with agricultural production. Increasing our ethanol production through the use of corn could produce negative effects on wildlife, the magnitude of which will depend on the scale of production and whether the land used for this increased production was formerly idle, in a natural state, or planted with other row crops.
Another consideration is whether to plant a switchgrass monoculture or use a variety of grasses and other vegetation. While a mixture of vegetation types likely would provide better wildlife habitat, the technology has not yet developed to allow the processing of a mixture of different grass species or vegetation types into bioethanol. Of course, cellulosic ethanol production is still in its infancy, and the possibility of using diverse vegetation stands instead of monocultures deserves further exploration as research continues.&lt;ref&gt;BIES L (2006) The Biofuels Explosion: Is Green Energy Good for Wildlife? Wildlife Society Bulletin: Vol. 34, No. 4 pp. 1203–1205&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by Nobel Prize winner [[Paul Crutzen]] found ethanol produced from corn had a "net climate warming" effect when compared to oil when the full [[life cycle assessment]] properly considers the [[nitrous oxide]] (N20) emissions that occur during [[corn ethanol]] production. Crutzen found that crops with less [[nitrogen]] demand, such as grasses and woody coppice species, have
more favourable climate impacts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atmos-chem-phys.org/8/389/2008/acp-8-389-2008.pdf Crutzen, PJ, Mosier AR, Smith KA, Winiwarter W. "Nitrous oxide release from agro-biofuel production negates global warming reduction by replacing fossil fuels", ''Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics'', 8(2): 389–395 (2008).]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cellulosic ethanol commercialization==
{{Main|Cellulosic ethanol commercialization}}
{{Update|section|date=November 2017}}
Cellulosic ethanol commercialization is the process of building an industry out of methods of turning cellulose-containing organic matter into fuel. Companies such as [[Iogen Corp.|Iogen]], [[POET]], and [[Abengoa]] are building refineries that can process biomass and turn it into ethanol, while companies such as [[DuPont]], [[Diversa]], [[Novozymes]], and [[Dyadic International|Dyadic]] are producing enzymes which could enable a cellulosic ethanol future. The shift from food crop feedstocks to waste residues and native grasses offers significant opportunities for a range of players, from farmers to biotechnology firms, and from project developers to investors.&lt;ref&gt;Pernick, Ron and Wilder, Clint (2007). ''[[The Clean Tech Revolution]]'' p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cellulosic ethanol industry developed some new commercial-scale plants in 2008. In the United States, plants totaling 12 million liters (3.17 million gal) per year were operational, and an additional 80 million liters (21.1 million gal.) per year of capacity  - in 26 new plants - was under construction. In Canada, capacity of 6 million liters per year was operational. In Europe, several plants were operational in Germany, Spain, and Sweden, and capacity of 10 million liters per year was under construction.&lt;ref name=re&gt;[[REN21]] (2009).

Italy-based [[Mossi &amp; Ghisolfi Group]] broke ground for its 13 MMgy cellulosic ethanol facility in northwestern Italy on April 12, 2011. The project will be the largest cellulosic ethanol project in the world, 10 times larger than any of the currently operating demonstration-scale facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethanolproducer.com/articles/7659/worldundefineds-largest-cellulosic-ethanol-plant-breaks-ground-in-italy |title=World’s largest cellulosic ethanol plant breaks ground in Italy |author= Kris Bevill  |date=April 12, 2011  |work=Ethanol Producer Magazine }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6097">'''Commercialization''' or '''commercialisation '''is the [[business process|process]] of introducing a new [[Product (business)|product]] or [[Methods of production|production method]] into [[commerce]]—making it available on the [[market (economics)|market]]. The term often [[connotation|connotes]] especially entry into the [[mass market]] (as opposed to entry into earlier [[niche market]]s), but it also includes a move from the [[laboratory]] into (even limited) commerce. Many technologies begin in a [[research and development]] laboratory or in an inventor's workshop and may not be practical for commercial use in their infancy (as [[prototype]]s). The "development" segment of the "[[research and development]]" spectrum requires time and money as [[industrial engineering|systems are engineered]] with a view to making the product or method a paying [[commerce|commercial]] proposition. The product launch of a new product is the final stage of [[new product development]] - at this point [[advertising]], [[sales promotion]], and other [[marketing]] efforts encourage commercial [[early adopter|adoption]] of the product or method. Beyond commercialization (in which technologies enter the business world) can lie [[consumerization]] (in which they become [[final good|consumer goods]], as for example when [[computer]]s went from the laboratory to the enterprise and then to the home, pocket, or body).

== Process==
Commercialization is often confused{{by whom?|date=November 2016}} with [[sales]], marketing, or [[business development]]. The commercialization process has three key aspects:
# The funnel.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; It is essential{{cn|date=November 2016}} to look at many ideas to get one or two products or businesses that can be sustained long-term.
# Commercialization is a stage-wise process, and each stage has its own key goals and milestones.
# It is vital to involve key [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] early, including [[customers]].

== Issues ==
Proposed commercialization of a product can raise the following questions:

# When to launch: Factors such as potential cannibalization of the sales of a vendor's other products, any requirement for further improvement of the proposed new product, or unfavorable [[economy|market conditions]] may operate to delay a product launch.
# Where to launch: A potential vendor can start marketing in a single location, in one or several [[marketing region | region]]s, or in a [[national market | national]] or [[international market]]. Existing resources (in terms of capital, and operational capacities) and the degree of managerial confidence may strongly influence the proposed launch-mode. Smaller vendors usually launch in attractive cities or regions, while larger [[company | companies]] may enter a national market at once.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}&lt;br /&gt;Global roll-outs generally remain the preserve of multinational conglomerates, since they have the necessary size and make use of international distribution systems (e.g., [[Unilever]], [[Procter &amp; Gamble]]). Other multinationals may use a [[lead country|"lead-country"]] strategy: introducing the new product in one country/region at a time (e.g. [[Colgate-Palmolive]]).{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}
# Whom to target: [[market research|Research-]] and [[test marketing | test-marketing]] may identify a [[primary consumer group]]. The ideal primary consumer group should consist of [[innovators]], [[early adopter]]s, heavy users and/or [[Opinion leadership|opinion leader]]s. This will encourage adoption by other buyers in the market during the [[product growth|product-growth]] period.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}
# How to launch: Prospective vendors should decide on an [[action plan]]{{cn|date=November 2016}} for introducing a proposed product - a plan shaped by addressing the questions above. The vendor has to develop a viable [[marketing mix|marketing-mix]]{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} and to structure a corresponding marketing-[[budget]].

Corrugated boxes are used frequently as [[shipping container]]s. Boxes need to contain the product from manufacturing through distribution to sale and sometimes end-use.  Boxes provide some measure of product protection by themselves but often require inner components such as [[cushioning]], bracing and blocking to help protect fragile contents. The shipping hazards depend largely upon the particular [[logistics]] system being employed.  For example, boxes unitized into a [[unit load]] on a [[pallet]] do not encounter individual handling while boxes sorted and shipped through part of their distribution cycle as mixed loads or express carriers can receive severe [[Shock (mechanics)|shock]]s, kicks, etc...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Singh |first= S.

Ordinary shipping containers require printing and [[label]]s to identify the contents, provide legal and regulatory information, and [[bar code]]s for routing. Boxes that are used for marketing, merchandising, and point-of-sale often have high graphics to help communicate the contents. Some boxes are designed for display of contents on the shelf. Others are designed to help dispense the contents.  Popular for their strength, durability, lightness, recyclability, and cost-effectiveness, corrugated boxes are used for the shipping of a variety of items. Due to the quality and safety of packaging items in corrugated boxes, they are used widely in the food industry. The boxes handle the pressure that comes with stacking, making them ideal for easy transporting.&lt;ref name="appleltd1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appleltd.com/corrugated_boxes_manufacturing.aspx |title=Corrugated Box Manufacturing Process &amp;#124; How Are Corrugated Boxes Made |publisher=Appleltd.com |date=2010-12-20 |accessdate=2014-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 95% of all products in the [[United States]] are shipped in corrugated boxes. Corrugated paperboard accounts for more than half of all the paper recycled in the US.&lt;ref name="appleltd1"/&gt;

===Stacking strength===
One of the important functions of a corrugated box is to provide crush resistance (product protection) and adequate strength for stacking in warehouses.

A box can be designed by optimizing the grade of corrugated board, box design, flute direction, and inner supports. Support from the product also provides "load sharing" and can be an important factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Koning |first=J|authorlink= |author2=Moody |date=November 1966 |title=Slip Pad, Vertical Alignment Increase Stacking Strength 65%|journal=Boxboard Containers|volume= |issue= |pages= |id=|url= |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Box closures sometimes can have effects on box stacking strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

If long-term storage of corrugated boxes in high humidity is expected, extra strength and moisture resistance is called for.

The method of loading boxes on pallets strongly affects stacking.  Vertical columns provide the best box performance while interlocking patterns of boxes significantly reduce performance.  The interaction of the boxes and pallets is also important.

[[Box compression test]]ing is a means of evaluating boxes, stacks of boxes, and [[unit load]]s under controlled conditions.  Field conditions of stacking and dynamic compression do not have the same degree of control.  Compression strength can be estimated based on container construction, size, and use parameters: actual [[package testing]] is often conducted to verify these estimates.

Many [[packaging engineer]]s find it beneficial to periodically audit [[warehouse]]s and visit customer's package receiving operations.  When field performance is observed or documented to have problems, a new cycle of design and testing may be justified.
for a corrugated box to withstand the deformation while stacking or storage  (stack load = 1/3 compression strength).
where stack load=gross weight of box *stack height.

=== Estimating compression ===
Fiber Box Association has a method for estimating compression strength which includes the following factors:
* Time
* Moisture
* Palletizing type
* Pallet patterns
* Pallet type
* Handling

==Process==
{{main|corrugated fiberboard}}
[[File:Package Drop tester.jpg|thumb|250px|Laboratory drop test to determine ability to withstand rough handling]]
[[Packaging engineer]]s design corrugated boxes to meet the particular needs of the product being shipped, the hazards of the shipping environment, (shock, vibration, compression, moisture, etc.), and the needs of retailers and consumers

Engineers and designers start with the needs of the particular project: cost constraints, machinery capabilities, product characteristics, logistics needs, applicable regulations, consumer needs, etc.  Often designs are made with [[Computer Aided Design]] programs connected to automated sample making tables. Several design and construction options might be considered.

Samples are often submitted to [[Performance test (assessment)|performance testing]] based on [[ASTM]] or other [[Technical standard|standard]] test protocols such as the International Safe Transit Association. Structural design is matched with [[graphic design]].  For consumer based designs, marketing personnel sometimes use [[Focus group]]s or more quantitative means of assessing acceptance. [[Test market]]s are employed for major programs.

The process starts by making corrugated board on a corrugating line, a long series of linked machines which may be in size of a [[Yard lines|football field]].  A finished piece of singlewall corrugated board is a single corrugated layer sandwiched between two liners.&lt;ref name="appleltd1"/&gt;

Skilled workers prepare job tickets for each stack of box blanks and route the blanks to fabrication machines. Printing dies and patterns are prepared on large, flexible, rubber or tin sheets. They are loaded onto rollers and the box blanks are fed through it, where each is trimmed, printed, cut, scored, folded, and glued to form a box. Finished boxes are then stacked and sent to a banding machine to be wrapped and shipped.&lt;ref name="appleltd1"/&gt;

==Design==
The most common box style is the Regular Slotted Container (RSC). All flaps are the same length from score to edge.  Typically the major flaps meet in the middle and the minor flaps do not, unless the width is equal to the length.  Box styles in Europe are typically specified by a 4-digit code provided by the European Federation of Corrugated Board Manufacturers (FEFCO): A regular slotted container is coded 0201.
[[Image:Regular Slotted Container.svg|thumb|Regular Slotted Container]]
[[Image:Blank RSC.svg|thumb|Box blank for a regular slotted container showing score lines, slots, and manufacturer's joint]]

The manufacturer's joint is most often joined with adhesive but may also be taped or stitched. The box is shipped flat (knocked down) to the packager who sets up the box, fills it, and closes it for shipment. Box closure may be by tape, adhesive, staples, [[strapping]], etc.

Many other styles of corrugated boxes and structures are available:
* FOL (Full Overlap): A Full Overlap Box is similar to an RSC except the major flaps fully overlap. Full-overlap flaps provide extra stacking strength and edge protection.
* HSC (Half Slotted Container): Half-Slotted Containers (HSC) are similar to an RSC, but with only one set of flaps. They are useful when an open-top container is desired. HSCs can be used to create a telescope box.
* A Full Telescope Box has two fully telescoping sections. The sections may be formed by staples, die-cut locks, adhesive, etc.
* A Partial Telescope Box has two sections. The top telescopes partially over the bottom. Commonly used for holding printing paper.
* A corrugated tray is often used for display purposes or used with a [[shrink wrap]]
* Corrugated corner pads can be used for product support and [[cushioning]]
* Special die-cut shapes have almost endless designs and uses.
* etc.

The size of a box can be measured for either internal (for product fit) or external (for handling machinery or palletizing) dimensions. Boxes are usually specified and ordered by the internal dimensions.

==Retail display==
{{Main|Shelf-ready packaging}}
Retailers often ask for merchandise to be delivered to them in shipping containers which allow the easy stocking of full case loads.     The goal is to put the case directly onto shelves and stocking locations without individually handling the unit packs or primary packages. Retailers often require products to come in shelf -ready packaging to reduce stocking costs and save labor expenses.
Several specialized box designs are available.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite patent

==Individual mixed shipments==
[[Image:Distribution differences.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Box construction needs to be matched to its [[logistics]] system. Packages designed for controlled shipments of uniform [[pallet]] loads may not be suited to mixed shipments with [[express mail|express]] carriers.]]

Many items are shipped individually (in part or entirely) by express carrier, mail, or other mixed [[logistics]] systems. The demands of multiple manual handlings, automated sortation, and uncontrolled stacking in trucks or air containers put severe stress on boxes, box closures, and the contents.  Boxes designed for [[unit load]] handling and storage may not be suited to mixed logistics systems.

[[Less than truckload shipping]] puts more stress on corrugated shipping containers than shipment by uniform pallet loads in trucks or intermodal containers. Boxes sometimes need to be heavier construction to match the needs of the distribution system.

==Government, military, and export==
Many items being supplied to governments are handled very well: boxes are unitized, shipped on covered trucks or [[intermodal container]]s, and storage is in [[warehouse]]s.  Normal “domestic boxes” and commercial packaging are acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;ASTM Standard D3951 - Standard Practice for Commercial Packaging&lt;/ref&gt;

Military [[materiel]], field supplies,  and humanitarian aid often encounter severe handling and uncontrolled storage.  Special box [[specification]]s for government shipments are often applicable.  Weather-resistant fiberboards, box construction, box closure, and unitizing are needed.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Export===
Many international shipments are handled very well: boxes are unitized,  shipped on covered trucks or [[intermodal container]]s, and storage is in [[warehouse]]s.  Normal “domestic boxes” are commonly used.

[[Break bulk cargo]] needs to be water resistant and heavy duty.  Even shipments initially sent via [[intermodal freight transport]]  may have subsequent logistics operations that are extreme and uncontrolled.  The specific conditions in the destination port and the country of use need to be considered for design of export boxes.

==Dangerous and hazardous goods==
[[File:Corrugated box - haz mat.jpg|thumb|Doublewall box with dividers for shipping four bottles of corrosive liquid]]
Shipment of [[dangerous goods]] or hazardous materials are highly regulated. Based on the [[UN Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods]] model regulations, each country has coordinated design and performance requirements for shipment.  For example, in the US, the Department of Transportation has jurisdiction and published requirements in [[Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations]]. Corrugated boxes are described in 4G requirements.  Performance (severe drop test, etc.) needs to be certified for the box and contents.

Some carriers have additional requirements.

==Box closure==
The means of closing a box is an important aspect of design.  It affects the types of equipment available to production lines, the measured laboratory performance, the field performance, and the ability of end-users to easily and safely open the box.

Box closures include:
* [[Adhesive]],  water based or [[hot-melt adhesive]]-Adhesives are applied manually or by machine.starch based adhesives is the choice of a corrugator as it is economic .starch work as a medium for moulds, litchens &amp;fungus so to prevent it antifungals are added in it before use.
* [[Staple (fastener)|Staples]]- staples are used to attach the box flaps.  Small (nominally ½ inch crown) staples can be applied to a box with a post stapler. Wider crown (nominally 1¼ inch) staples can be applied with a blind clincher
* [[Box sealing tape]], pressure-sensitive-taps are available in various widths i.e. 36, 48, and 72&amp;nbsp;mm widths and several thicknesses. BOPP and PET are used as a backings.  Taping is done either manually or by semi automatic machine.
* [[Filament tape]], pressure-sensitive
* [[Gum tape|Water activated gummed paper]]- it consist of a heavy paper in which adhesive is applied and dried,when water is applied to it adhesive tackeness and binding ability is again generated.
* Reinforced water activated gummed tape
* [[Strapping]]- straps are generally used for unitizing,made up of plastic(PP,PE,PET,PVC),metal(SS steel) etc. and available various width.
* [[Shrink wrap]]- it is a thin film of LLDPE, LDPE etc. which shrinks with the application of heat resulting in wrapping a box from all sides.it is costlier amongst all as it needs hot tunnel and material consumption will be more. However, the packed box will be protected from environment as it will work as a barrier.

A '''creep-testing machine'''  measures the [[Creep (deformation)|creep]] (the tendency of a material after being subjected to high levels of stress, e.g. high temperatures, to change its form in relation to time) of an object. It is a device that measures the alteration of a material after it has been put through different forms of stress. Creep machines are important to see how much strain (load) an object can handle under pressure, so engineers and researchers are able to determine what materials to use. The device generates a creep time-dependent curve by calculating the steady rate of creep in reference to the time it takes for the material to change. Creep machines are primarily used by engineers to determine the stability of a material and its behaviour when it is put through ordinary stresses.

==Background==
The first creep testing machines were created in 1948 in Britain to test materials for aircraft to see how they would stand in high altitudes, temperature and pressure.&lt;ref name ="archive"&gt;A.  I. Smith, D. Murray, M. F. Day, "Creep Testing Equipment-Design Features and Control"; Volume 180 Pt. 3A, 1965-66, pg.303-307&lt;/ref&gt; The machines were first developed to further calculate and understand the steady rate of creep in materials. Creep is the tendency of a material to change form over time after facing high temperature and stress. Creep increases with temperature and it is more common when a material is exposed to high temperatures for a long time or at the melting point of the material. Creep machines are used to understand the creep of materials and determine which type can do the job better, which is important when making and designing materials for everyday uses. They most commonly test the creep of alloys and plastics for the understanding of their properties and advantages of one material's use over another.&lt;ref&gt;W. Blum, Materials Science and Engineering: A; Volumes 319-321, December 2001, pg.735-740&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
Researchers look to test objects with a creep machine to understand the process of metallurgy and the physical mechanical properties of a metal, test the development of alloys, receive data from the loads that are derived and to find out whether a sample or material is within the boundary of what they are testing.&lt;ref name="archive"/&gt; The basic design of a creep machine is the furnace, loading device and support structure.

The main type of creep testing machine that is most commonly used is a constant load creep testing machine.The constant load creep machine consists of a loading platform, foundation, fixture devices and furnace. The fixture devices are the grips and pull rods.&lt;ref&gt;J.B. Grishaber,"A Novel Computer Controlled Constant Stress Lever Arm Creep Testing Machine", Review of Scientific Instruments; Jul97, Vol. 68 Issue 7, pg.2812&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Load platform''' or sometimes called load hanger is where the object will endure pressure at a constant rate.&lt;ref name="MoMoh"/&gt;
*'''Grips''' are used to hold the material you are testing in a certain position. Position is important because if the alignment is off, the machine will deliver inaccurate readings of the creep  of the material.&lt;ref name="MoMoh"/&gt;
*'''Dial Gauge''' is used to measure the strain. It is the object that captures the movement of the object in the machine. The load beam transfers the movement from the grip to the dial gauge.&lt;ref name="MoMoh"/&gt;
*'''Heating Chamber''' is what surrounds the object and maintain the temperature that the object is subjected to.&lt;ref name="MoMoh"/&gt;

==Applications==
Creep machines are most commonly used in experiments to determine how efficient and stable a material is. The machine is used by students and companies  to create a  creep curve on how much pressure and stress a material can handle. The machine is able to calculate the stress rate, time and pressure.&lt;ref name="MoMoh"&gt;John J. MOMOH, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Federal Polytechnic, Ado-Ekiti, "Modification and Performance Evaluation of a Low Cost Electro-Mechanically Operated Creep Testing Machine", http://ljs.academicdirect.org/A16/083_094.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Creep testing has three different applications in the industry:
#'''Displacement-Limited applications ''': the size must be precise and there must be little errors or tendency to change.This is most commonly found in turbine rotors in jet engines.
# '''Rupture Limited applications''': in this application the break cannot occur to the material but there can be various dimensions as the material goes through creep. High pressure tubes are examples of them.
#'''Stress relaxation limited application ''': the tension at the beginning becomes more relaxed and the tension will continue to relax as the time goes by, such as cable wires and bolts.&lt;ref name="ppt"&gt;Dr. Sabbah Ataya, "Creep Testing Machines", 2008, http://www.slideshare.net/ea2m/creep-testing-machines-presentation&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graphing of Creep===
Creep is dependent on time so the curve that the machine generates is a time vs. strain graph. The slope of a creep curve is the creep rate dε/dt&lt;ref name="MoMoh"/&gt; The trend of the curve is an upward slope. The graphs are important to learn the trends of the alloys or materials used and by the production of the creep-time graph, it is easier to determine the better material for a specific application.

====[[Stages of Creep]]====
There are three stages of creep: 
*'''Primary Creep''': the initial creep stage where the slope is rising rapidly at first in a short amount of time. After a certain amount of time has elapsed, the slope will begin to slowly decrease from its initial rise.
*'''Steady State Creep''': the creep rate is constant so the line on the curve shows a straight line that is a steady rate.
*'''Tertiary Creep''': the last stage of creep when the object that is being subjected to pressure is going to reach its breaking point. In this stage, the object's creep continuously increases until the object breaks. The slope of this stage is very steep for most materials.
By examining the three stages above, scientists are able to determine the temperature and interval in which an object will be disturbed once exposed to the load. Some materials have a very small secondary creep state and may go straight from the primary creep to the tertiary creep state. This is dependent on the properties of the material that is being tested. This is important to note because going straight to the tertiary state causes the material to break faster from its form.&lt;ref name="lab"&gt;Experiment 4 Lab, Center for Reliability of Ceramics, Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Houston, {{cite web |url=http://www.me.uh.edu/ceramics/3445LabManual/4.CREEP.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041201053559/http://www.me.uh.edu/ceramics/3445LabManual/4.CREEP.pdf |archivedate=2004-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A linear graph  denotes that the material under stress is gradually deforming and this would be harder to track at what level of stress an object can handle. This would also mean that the material would not have distinct stages,which would make object's breaking point would be less predictable. This is a disadvantage to scientists and engineers when trying to determine the level of creep the object can handle.&lt;ref&gt;Narayana, V. J. S., K. Balasubramaniam, and R. V. Prakash. "Detection And Prediction Of Creep-Damage Of Copper Using Nonlinear Acoustic Techniques." AIP Conference Proceedings 1211.1,2010, pg.1410-1417&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyclotol is not commonly used, but was reportedly the main explosive used in at least some models of US [[Nuclear weapon]]. Sublette lists Cyclotol as the explosive in the US [[B28 nuclear bomb]] and possibly related weapons that used the common [[Python primary]] - [[W34 (nuclear bomb)|W34]], [[W28]], [[W40 (nuclear warhead)|W40]], and [[W49]].
 
It was used in the [[B53 nuclear bomb]] and associated W53 warhead.

A '''decanter''' is a vessel that is used to hold the [[decantation]] of a liquid (such as [[wine]]) which may contain [[sediment]]. Decanters, which have a varied shape and design, have been traditionally made from [[glass]] or [[lead glass|crystal]]. Their volume is usually equivalent to one standard [[wine bottle|bottle]] of wine (0.75 litre).&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 223-225"&gt;{{cite book|first=Jancis|last=Robinson|title=The Oxford Companion to Wine|edition= Third|pages= 223-225|publisher= [[Oxford University Press]]|year= 2006| ISBN= 0-19-860990-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A [[carafe]], which is also traditionally used for serving alcoholic beverages, is similar in design to a decanter but is not supplied with a stopper.

==History==
[[File:Carafe Iran.JPG|thumb|right|Free-blown, wheel-cut carafes. First half of 11th century. Excavated at ''Teppe Madraseh'', [[Neishapur]], [[Iran]]. [[New York Metropolitan Museum of Art]].]]
Throughout the [[history of wine]], decanters have played a significant role in the serving of wine. The vessels would be filled with wine from [[amphora]]s and brought to the table where they could be more easily handled by a single servant. The [[Ancient Romans]] pioneered the use of glass as a material. After the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]], glass production became scarce causing the majority of decanters to be made of [[bronze]], [[silver]], [[gold]], or [[earthenware]]. The [[Venice|Venetians]] reintroduced glass decanters during the [[Renaissance]] period and pioneered the style of a long slender neck that opens to a wide body, increasing the exposed surface area of the wine, allowing it to react with air. In the 1730s, [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] glass makers introduced the [[Stopper (plug)|stopper]] to limit exposure to air. Since then, there has been little change to the basic design of the decanter.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 223-225"/&gt; 

Although conceived for wine, other alcoholic beverages, such as [[cognac (drink)|cognac]] or [[single malt Scotch]] whisky, are often stored and served in stoppered decanters. Certain cognacs and malt whiskies are sold in decanters such as the 50-year-old single malt [[Dalmore distillery|Dalmore]] or the [[Bowmore|Bowmore Distillery]] 22 Year Old.

==Decanting process==
Liquid from another vessel is poured into the decanter in order to separate a small volume of liquid, containing the [[sediment (wine)|sediment]], from a larger volume of "clear" liquid, which is free of such. In the process, the sediment is left in the original vessel, and the clear liquid is transferred to the decanter. This is analogous to [[racking]], but performed just before serving.

Decanters have been used for serving wines that are laden with sediments in the original bottle. These sediments could be the result of a very old wine or one that was not [[filtered (wine)|filtered]] or [[clarified (wine)|clarified]] during the [[winemaking]] process. In most modern winemaking, the need to decant for this purpose has been significantly reduced, because many wines no longer produce a significant amount of sediment as they age.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 223-225"/&gt;

==Aeration==
Another reason for decanting wine is to [[aeration|aerate]] it, or allow it to "breathe". The decanter is meant to mimic the effects of swirling the wine glass to stimulate the oxidation processes which triggers the release of more aromatic compounds. In addition it is thought to benefit the wine by smoothing some of the harsher aspects of the wine (like [[tannins (wine)|tannins]] or potential [[wine faults]] like [[mercaptans]]). Many wine writers, such as author [[Karen MacNeil]] in the book ''The Wine Bible'', advocate decanting for the purposes of aeration, especially with very tannic wines like [[Barolo]], [[Bordeaux wine|Bordeaux]], [[Cabernet Sauvignon]], [[Port wine|Port]], and [[Rhône wine]]s while noting that decanting could be harmful for more delicate wines like [[Chianti]] and [[Pinot noir]].&lt;ref name="MacNeil pg 93-95"&gt;{{cite book|first=K|last= MacNeil|title=The Wine Bible|pages= 93-95|publisher= Workman Publishing|year= 2001| ISBN= 1-56305-434-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the effectiveness of decanting is a topic of debate, with some wine experts such as [[oenologist]] [[Émile Peynaud]] claiming that the prolonged exposure to oxygen actually diffuses and dissipates more aroma compounds than it stimulates, in contrast to the effects of the smaller scale exposure and immediate release that swirling the wine in a drinker's glass has.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 223-225"/&gt;  In addition it has been reported that the process of decanting over a period of a few hours does not have the effect of softening tannins. The softening of tannins occurs during the winemaking and [[oak (wine)|oak aging]] when tannins go through a process of [[polymerization]] that can last days or weeks; decanting merely alters the perception of [[sulfites]] and other chemical compounds in the wine through oxidation, which can give some drinkers the sense of softer tannins in the wine.&lt;ref name="Sogg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.winespectator.com/Wine/Archives/Show_Article/0,1275,4385,00.html|title=Decanting: Aeration -- friend and enemy of wine|publisher=  [[Wine Spectator]]|date= November 15, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In line with the view that decanting can dissipate aromas, wine expert [[Kerin O'Keefe]] prefers to let the wine evolve slowly and naturally in the bottle, by uncorking it a few hours ahead, a practice suggested by wine producers such as [[Bartolo Mascarello]] and [[Franco Biondi Santi]]. &lt;ref name="KOdecant"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.winemag.com/2015/05/21/the-great-debate-to-decant-or-not/|title=The Great Debate: To Decant or Not?|publisher=  [[Wine Enthusiast]]|date= May 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other wine experts, such as writer [[Jancis Robinson]], tout the [[aesthetic]] value of using a decanter, especially one with an elegant design and made with clear glass, and believe that for all but the most fragile of wines that there is not much significant damage to the wine by decanting it.&lt;ref name="Robinson pg 20-25"&gt;{{cite book|first=Jancis|last= Robinson|title=Jancis Robinson's Wine Course|edition= Third|pages= 20-25|publisher= [[Abbeville Press]]|year= 2003| ISBN= 0-7892-0883-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; A decanter can also be used to present wine anonymously.

A '''digital duplicator''', also known as a printer-duplicator, is a printing technology designed for high-volume print jobs (20 copies or more). Digital duplicators can provide a reliable and cost efficient alternative to toner-based [[copiers]] or [[offset printing]] equipment.

The digital duplicator begins by digitally [[Image scanner|scanning]] the original and then transferring it to a master template through a [[thermal imaging]] process. Then the master is automatically wrapped around a print cylinder, where the ink is drawn through the perforations in the master creating the print.

Digital duplicators are known for their high speed in comparison to other printing methods.  They are able to produce anywhere from 45 to 180 prints per minute, while maintaining a per page cost that can be as low as 1/3 of a cent. They are also considered very reliable because they do not use heat or copier components, such as toner.

[[Image:Drink with straw.jpg|thumb|upright|A pink bendy straw in a drink]]

A '''drinking straw''' or '''drinking tube''' is a small pipe that allows its user to more conveniently consume a beverage. A thin tube of paper, plastic (such as [[polypropylene]] and [[polystyrene]]), or other material is used by placing one end in the mouth and the other in the beverage. A combination of muscular action of the [[tongue]] and [[cheek]]s reduces air [[pressure]] in the mouth and above the liquid in the straw, whereupon [[atmospheric pressure]] forces the beverage through the straw. Drinking straws can be straight or have an angle-adjustable [[bellows]] segment.

Plastic straws account for a significant amount of unrecycled plastic waste,{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} and contribute to plastic pollution in the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;https://oceanconservancy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/International-Coastal-Cleanup_2017-Report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, numerous campaigns in the 2010s have led to companies considering a switch to paper straws,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.marpolbul.2018.10.001 |title=Reducing marine pollution from single-use plastics (SUPs): A review |journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin |volume=137 |pages=157–171 |year=2018 |last1=Schnurr |first1=Riley E.J. |last2=Alboiu |first2=Vanessa |last3=Chaudhary |first3=Meenakshi |last4=Corbett |first4=Roan A. |last5=Quanz |first5=Meaghan E. |last6=Sankar |first6=Karthikeshwar |last7=Srain |first7=Harveer S. |last8=Thavarajah |first8=Venukasan |last9=Xanthos |first9=Dirk |last10=Walker |first10=Tony R. }}&lt;/ref&gt; even though 90% of ocean plastic comes from 10 rivers in Asia and Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Prachi |last=Patel |date=February 1, 2018 |title=Stemming the Plastic Tide: 10 Rivers Contribute Most of the Plastic in the Oceans |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/stemming-the-plastic-tide-10-rivers-contribute-most-of-the-plastic-in-the-oceans/ |work=Scientific American }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Disputed inline|90%_of_plastic_really_only_from_a_few_rivers? |for=conflict with sources cited above|date=November 2018}}

==History==
The first known straws were made by the [[Sumer]]ians, and were used for drinking beer,&lt;ref name=thompson2011/&gt; probably to avoid the solid byproducts of [[Fermentation (food)|fermentation]] that sink to the bottom.&lt;ref name="maeir1992"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1179/007589192790220793 |title=Bone and Metal Straw-tip Beer-strainers from the Ancient Near East |journal=Levant |volume=24 |pages=218–223 |year=2013 |last1=Maeir |first1=Aren M. |last2=Garfinkel |first2=Yosef }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="homan2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Homan |first1=Michael |title=Beer and Its Drinkers: An Ancient Near Eastern Love Story |journal=Near Eastern Archaeology |date=2004 |volume=67 |issue=2 |pages=84–95 |url=https://www.academia.edu/17738197 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest drinking straw in existence, found in a Sumerian tomb dated 3,000&amp;nbsp;BCE, was a gold tube inlaid with the precious blue stone [[lapis lazuli]].&lt;ref name=thompson2011/&gt; [[Argentina|Argentines]] and their neighbors have, for several hundred years, used (for drinking [[yerba mate|mate]] tea) a similar metallic device called a [[bombilla]], that acts as both a straw and a sieve.&lt;ref name=thompson2011/&gt;

===Ryegrass straw===
In the 1800s, the [[rye grass]] straw came into fashion because it was cheap and soft, but it had an unfortunate tendency to turn to mush in liquid.&lt;ref name=thompson2011/&gt;

===Wax paper straw===
[[Marvin Stone|Marvin C. Stone]] patented the modern drinking straw, made of paper, in 1888, to address the shortcomings of the rye grass straw.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | inventor1-last = Stone | inventor1-first = Marvin | title = Artificial straw | issue-date = 1888 | patent-number = 375962 | country-code = US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He came upon the idea while drinking a [[mint julep]] on a hot day in Washington, D.C.;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bonappetit.com/entertaining-style/trends-news/article/history-of-the-straw|title=A Brief History of the Straw|first=Catherine|last=Hollander|date=|website=bonappetit.com|accessdate=August 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://time.com/5336242/plastic-straws-history/|title=The Backlash Against Plastic Straws Is Spreading.

Early paper straws had a narrow [[Lumen (anatomy)|bore]] similar to that of the grass stems then in common use. It was common to use two of them, to reduce the effort needed to take each sip.  (The cocktail straw, which is sometimes used in pairs, may be derived from such early straws.) Modern plastic straws are made with a larger bore, and only one is needed for ease of drinking.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==Types==
[[Image:Straw-O.jpg|thumb|Drinking straw widths. Size in mm.]]

* A '''basic drinking straw''' is straight for its full length.
* A '''bendable straw''' or "bendy straw" (known in the industry as an "articulated straw") has a [[concertina]]-type hinge near the top for convenience. This variation was invented by [[Joseph Friedman]] in 1937.&lt;ref name=thompson2011&gt;{{cite news |first=Derek |last=Thompson |date=November 22, 2011 |title=The Amazing History and the Strange Invention of the Bendy Straw |work=The Atlantic |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/11/the-amazing-history-and-the-strange-invention-of-the-bendy-straw/248923/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://americanhistory.si.edu/archives/d8769.htm Friedman and the Flexible Straw] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404005224/https://americanhistory.si.edu/archives/d8769.htm |date=April 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Candy straws''', such as [[Liquorice|licorice]] straws (or lico-straws), are made from some type of chewy candy.
* '''cereal straws''' are made by [[Kellogg's]].
* "'''color-changer'''" straws change color when cold (or hot) liquid passes through them. At some restaurants, frozen beverages like [[Slush (beverage)|slush]] or [[Frappé coffee|frappes]] are served with color changing straws. Many of these are larger in diameter than typical straws to aid in drinking the thicker beverages.
* A "'''crazy (or "krazy") straw'''" is hard, [[Transparency and translucency|transparent or translucent]] plastic and has a number of twists and turns at the top. When liquid is sucked through the straw, it quickly flows through the winding path, creating a mildly amusing spectacle, popular with children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bonappetit.com/entertaining-style/trends-news/article/history-of-the-straw | title=A Brief History of the Straw | website=Bon Appetit Magazine | date=October 2014 | accessdate=September 20, 2015 | author=Catherine Hollander | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907122223/https://www.bonappetit.com/entertaining-style/trends-news/article/history-of-the-straw | archivedate=September 7, 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The crazy straw may have some therapeutic benefit for people with [[autism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Crazy Straw |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/?id=ym98jC_aEVcC&amp;pg=PA182 |page=182|title=The Fabric of Autism: Weaving the Threads into a Cogent Theory|publisher=Sapphire Enterprises| date=2005|first=Judith |last=Bluestone|isbn=9780972023528}}{{MEDRS|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Extendo-straws''' come in small plastic wrappings like miniature straws, but can extend to reach the bottom of the carton.
* '''Flavor straws''' are a form of drinking straw with a flavoring included, designed to make drinking milk more pleasant for children. They were first marketed in the United States in 1956 as [[Flav-R-Straws]].&lt;ref&gt;''Milk plant monthly'', Volume 45, p. 68 (1956), quote: "New Flavored Straws For Use in Milk Drinks [...] A new type of straw with built-in flavor for use with milk drinks has been introduced by Flav-R Straws, Inc."&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, newer variations of the original idea have been resurrected in forms such as [[Sipahh]]s, and Magic Milk Straws that contain hundreds of flavored pellets encased within a stiff plastic straw.
* A '''miniature straw''' is often attached to a [[Juicebox (container)|drink box]].
[[File:Vogue SM.jpg|thumb|upright|Cover of ''[[Vogue (British magazine)|Vogue]]'' magazine depicting [[Kate Moss]] drinking through a straw]]

* '''"Sanitary" straws''' are individually wrapped to avoid contamination. Straws were originally marketed as a means for people to reduce the risk of contracting an illness from improperly washed containers, glasses, or cups.
* A '''spoon straw''' features a cut-away shape at one end that functions as a miniature spoon.  It is intended for [[Slush (beverage)|slush drinks]] and milkshakes. Their original purpose was to avoid ice clogging up the submerged end of the straw.&lt;ref&gt;[https://everything.explained.at/Drinking_straw/ "Drinking Straw Explained"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102023749/https://everything.explained.at/Drinking_straw/ |date=November 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Circular reference|date=June 2016}}
* A '''wide straw''' is used for sipping [[bubble tea]]. The larger diameter is necessary to accommodate the drink's characteristic [[Tapioca|tapioca pearls]], and can also be used for stirring. The tip of these straws are sometimes cut at an angle creating a point. This allows the straw to puncture the plastic cover of the cup. Wider than normal straws are said to give a better taste. McDonald's says they use wider straws "so all that Coke taste can hit all your taste buds".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kleynerman|first1=Stella|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/why-mcdonalds-coke-tastes-better-2017-2 |accessdate=February 15, 2018|deadurl=no|website=Business Insider|title=The real reason McDonald's Coke tastes so good| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829073651/https://www.businessinsider.com/why-mcdonalds-coke-tastes-better-2017-2 |archivedate=August 29, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/08/03/2-straw-plastic-ban-may-cost-san-francisco-boba-shops/873009002/|title=Would you pay $2 for a straw ?

* [[Polypropylene]] is becoming favored over polystyrene for manufacturing plastic drinking straws as polystyrene is brittle and tends to crack easily. Polystyrene is also denser than water, causing straws to sink when placed into beverages. Polypropylene straws, by contrast, are much more durable and do not sink.&lt;ref name="sciencefriday.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/not-the-last-straw-but-a-different-one/|title=Not The Last Straw, But A Different One|author=|date=|website=sciencefriday.com|accessdate=August 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Silicone]] is a newer material used in drinking straws.  Silicone straws are marketed for their freezability, invulnerability to cracking or peeling, and insulation for hot and cold drinks.
* Metal straws, popular among campers, are made from [[stainless steel]], aluminum, and even [[titanium]] - carry-cases with straw cleaning-brushes are available&lt;ref name="sciencefriday.com"/&gt;
* Paper has been used and is used more frequently, as unrecycled plastic waste from straws has been seen to be a problem.&lt;ref name="westerntelegraph1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Post reply |url=https://www.westerntelegraph.co.uk/news/16139797.McDonald_s_to_phase_out_plastic_drinking_straws_in_UK_restaurants/ |title=McDonald's to phase out plastic drinking straws in UK restaurants |publisher=Western Telegraph |date= |accessdate=April 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental impact==
Plastic drinking straw production contributes to petroleum consumption, and the used straws become part of global [[plastic pollution]] when discarded, most after a [[single use]]. One anti-straw advocacy group has estimated that about 500 million straws are used daily in the United States alone – an average 1.6 straws per capita per day.&lt;ref name="National Geographic News 2017"&gt;{{cite web | title=Straw Wars: The Fight to Rid the Oceans of Discarded Plastic | website=National Geographic News | date=April 12, 2017 | url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/04/plastic-straws-ocean-trash-environment/ | access-date=July 18, 2017 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629144206/https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/04/plastic-straws-ocean-trash-environment/ | archivedate=June 29, 2017 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bailey"&gt;{{cite web | last=Bailey | first=Kate | title=FAQs and Links – Milo's Be Straw Free Campaign | website=Eco-Cycle | url=http://www.ecocycle.org/bestrawfree/faqs | access-date=July 18, 2017 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705144922/http://ecocycle.org/bestrawfree/faqs | archivedate=July 5, 2017 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SSucking&gt;{{cite web|title=UNDERSTANDING PLASTIC POLLUTION|url=https://www.strawlessocean.org/faq/|website=Strawless Ocean|accessdate=February 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statistic has been criticized as inaccurate, because it is a guess made by Milo Cress, who was 9 years old at the time, after some phone conversations with straw manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://reason.com/blog/2018/01/25/california-bill-would-criminalize-restau|title=California Considers $1,000 Fine for Waiters Offering Unsolicited Plastic Straws|author=|date=January 25, 2018|website=reason.com|accessdate=August 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2018/05/02/plastics-single-use-straws-oceans Americans Throw Out Millions Of Plastic Straws Daily.

Straws are typically made from polypropylene, mixed with colorants and [[plasticizer]]s, and do not [[biodegrade]] in the environment.&lt;ref name=SSucking/&gt; Since the material is strong it can however be reused or recycled into other products. Waste straws in Uganda are collected from beer and soft drink depots, cleaned, and woven into mats for picnics and prayers or joined to form bags.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.womenrecyclingstraws.org |title=Strong, durable and re-usable bags made from waste drinking straws in Uganda |work=Strawbags |date= |accessdate=June 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement follows the discovery of plastic particles in oceanic [[Garbage patch (disambiguation)|garbage patches]]&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt; and larger plastic waste-reduction efforts that focused on banning [[plastic bag]]s in some jurisdictions.

===Plastic straw bans and proposals===

====Canada====
After the British proposition, fellow [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nation Canada was considering banning the straws too. An unofficial online survey showed that over 70% of voters agreed with a plastic straw ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ca.news.yahoo.com/vote-think-possible-ban-plastic-straws-canada-212801941.html|title=VOTE: What do you think of a possible ban on plastic straws in Canada?|last=DeLaire|first=Megan|date=April 20, 2018|work=[[Yahoo News]]|access-date=June 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 2019, a ban of plastic straws will go into effect in the City of [[Vancouver]], due to a vote in May 2018 that included banning other single-use items.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/4212702/vancouver-straw-ban/|title=City of Vancouver votes to ban single-use plastic straws and styrofoam cups|last=Stewart|first=Nadia|date=May 16, 2018|work=[[Global News]]|access-date=June 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====European Union====
In May 2018, the [[European Union]] proposed a ban on single-use plastics including straws, cotton buds, cutlery, balloon sticks and drink stirrers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44280532 |title=EU proposes ban on straws and other single-use plastics  |work=BBC News |date=28 May 2018 |accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====
On April 19, 2018, ahead of [[Earth Day]], a proposal to phase out single-use plastics was announced during the meeting of the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government]]. This will include plastic drinking straws, which cannot be recycled and contribute to ocean deterioration, damaging ecosystems and wildlife. It is estimated that as of 2018, about 23 million straws are used and discarded daily in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://time.com/5246692/uk-plastic-straws-ban/|title=The U.K. Might Want to Ban All Plastic Straws and Drink Stirrers So Savor Those Sips Today|last=Bruner|first=Raisa|date=April 19, 2018|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time magazine]]|access-date=June 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few months before, [[Queen Elizabeth II]] banned the plastic straws and other one-use plastic items from her palaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mentalfloss.com/article/532043/queen-elizabeth-plastic-straw-ban-buckingham-palace|title=Sip on This: The Queen Has Banned Plastic Straws at Buckingham Palace|last=Ferro|first=Shaunacy|date=February 21, 2018|work=[[Mental Floss]]|access-date=June 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, [[Williamstown, Massachusetts]] banned straws that are not recyclable or compostable as part of its Article 42 polystyrene regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nebula.wsimg.com/8549f0c39ff600121423356ffb23f12a?AccessKeyId=1C31A3B4B1A73412F089&amp;disposition=0&amp;alloworigin=1|title=REDUCTION OF POLYSTYRENE|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 7, 2017, the city of [[Santa Cruz, California]] implemented a ban on all non-recyclable to-go containers, straws, and lids but allowed for 6 months for all businesses to come into compliance before enforcement would occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press|url=https://www.cityofsantacruz.com/Home/Components/News/News/5669/36|title=City Newsroom - City of Santa Cruz|author=|date=|website=www.cityofsantacruz.com|accessdate=August 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 1, 2018, the city of [[Alameda, California]] citing the Santa Cruz effort, implemented an immediate ban on all straws, except if requested by a customer, and gave business until July 1, 2018 when it would be required that all straws to be of compostable paper and that all other to-go containers be recyclable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://alamedaca.gov/go-green/news/2017/12/18/straws-upon-request-new-year Straws Upon Request in the New Year - City of Alameda]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://alamedaca.gov/go-green-public-works/disposable-food-ware-ordinance Disposable Food Ware Ordinance - City of Alameda]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dry low emission''' (abbreviation '''DLE''') is a technology that reduces [[NOx]] emissions that exhausts out of gas fired turbines.&lt;ref name=oljedir /&gt;&lt;ref name=ntnu-oppg /&gt;&lt;ref name=tubinhandbok /&gt;&lt;ref name=sft /&gt;

The amount of NOx produced depends on the combustion temperature.&lt;ref name=ntnu-oppg /&gt;
When the combustion takes place at a lower temperature the NOx emissions are reduced.&lt;ref name=ntnu-oppg /&gt;
Gas turbines with DLE technology were developed to achieve lower emissions without using water or steam to reduce combustion temperature (Wet Low Emission (WLE) technology).&lt;ref name=oljedir /&gt;&lt;ref name=ntnu-oppg /&gt;
WLE technology demands cleaning of large amounts of water, is heavy, takes more space and can be difficult to install offshore.&lt;ref name=oljedir /&gt;
A DLE combustor uses the principle of lean premixed combustion, and is similar to the SAC combustor with some exceptions.&lt;ref name=oljedir /&gt;&lt;ref name=ntnu-oppg /&gt;
A DLE combustor takes up more space than a SAC turbine and if the turbine is changed it can not be connected directly to existing equipment without considerable changes in the positioning of the equipment.&lt;ref name=oljedir /&gt;
The SAC turbine has one single concentric ring where the DLE turbine has two or three rings with premixers depending on gas turbine type.&lt;ref name=ntnu-oppg /&gt;
DLE technology demands an advanced control system with a large number of burners.&lt;ref name=oljedir /&gt;&lt;ref name=ntnu-oppg /&gt;&lt;ref name=NTNUrapp /&gt;
DLE results in lower NOx emissions because the process is run with less fuel and air, the temperature is lower and combustion takes place at a lower temperature.&lt;ref name=oljedir /&gt;&lt;ref name=ntnu-oppg /&gt;&lt;ref name=NTNUrapp /&gt;&lt;ref name=NTNUrapp /&gt;&lt;ref name=Boston /&gt;

==Background for the technology==

Increased focus on environmental issues led to increased research on new and better gas turbines with water and steam cooling methods in the middle of the 1970s.&lt;ref name=NTNUrapp /&gt;&lt;ref name=lundphd /&gt;
The best technology could in 1980 reduce [[NOx]] emissions to 42 ppm and this was later reduced to 25 ppm.&lt;ref name=NTNUrapp /&gt;
In the 1990s ammonium and catalysators was tested and late in the 1980s the turbine producers started to develop "Dry Low Emission-technology" (DLE)
to be able to get around the technology that demanded water or steam injection.&lt;ref name=NTNUrapp /&gt;
During the next ten years the DLE technology was developed and installed in many places leading to a reduction of NOx emissions less than 25 ppm.&lt;ref name=sft /&gt;&lt;ref name=NTNUrapp /&gt;
It is difficult to achieve less than 9 ppm NOx emissions with DLE turbines.&lt;ref name=NTNUrapp /&gt;
To achieve a reduction from 25 ppm to 9 ppm more than 6 percent air must pass through the premixer.&lt;ref name=NTNUrapp /&gt;
Newer generations of DLE burners have an extra injection leading to better control.&lt;ref name=NTNUrapp /&gt;
Additional systems like "selective catalytic reduction" (SCR) are necessary to achieve emissions lower than 2.5 ppm.&lt;ref name=NTNUrapp /&gt;
Technologies using water or steam (Wet Low Emission (WLE) can achieve approximately the same level of NOx emissions (25–42 ppm) when they lower the combustion temperature.&lt;ref name=oljedir /&gt;

==Use of DLE-technology in the world==
This is not a complete list, but examples of where and when DLE technology has been implemented or are planned to be implemented.

;In Norway
DLE turbines were introduced offshore in Norway in 1998.&lt;ref name=oljedir /&gt;
All gas turbines installed offshore in Norway after year 2000 which uses only gas as fuel are DLE-turbines.&lt;ref name=oljedir /&gt;
The Kårstø facilities were planned with DLE technology.&lt;ref name=NTNUrapp /&gt;
DLE technology is used by Statoil ASA, Hammerfest LNG.&lt;ref name=klif /&gt;
The Norwegian Storting has decided that the Gina Krogh platform shall not be equipped with DLE technology due to the fact that all off Utsirahøyden will have electrical power supplies from the mainland.&lt;ref name=tu1 /&gt;

;In Europe
30 April 2012 a gas turbine generator with DLE technology was opened in Waidhaus in Bavaria in Germany.&lt;ref name=GRTgaz /&gt;

;In America
In Alberta in Canada it was in 2003 planned to use DLE technology in the power supplies.&lt;ref name=canada1 /&gt;

;In Asia
DLE is planned to be used in Australia.&lt;ref name=queen /&gt;

;In Africa
DLE is planned to be use in Egypt from 2006 GE Gas turbines frame 9 and Now 2018 applied with siemens Gas turbine 8000H .&lt;ref name=Ahmed /&gt;

The Malampaya field in the Republic of the Philippines was awarded in August 1998, construction of the topside was begun in June 1999 and completed on 28 March. 2001.&lt;ref name=filip /&gt;&lt;ref name=offshtech /&gt;
The topside was equipped with the worlds first RB211 with DLE technology.&lt;ref name=offshore /&gt;&lt;ref name=halli /&gt;

The '''du Noüy ring method''' is a technique for measuring the [[surface tension]] of a liquid. The method involves slowly lifting a ring, often made of platinum, from the surface of a liquid.  The force, &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, required to raise the ring from the liquid's surface is measured and related to the liquid's surface tension, &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;F= w_{(ring)} + 2\pi \cdot (r_i + r_a) \cdot \gamma&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;r_i&lt;/math&gt; is the radius of the inner ring of the liquid film pulled and &lt;math&gt;r_a&lt;/math&gt; is the radius of the outer ring of the liquid film.&lt;ref name="Physics and Chemistry of Interfaces"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Physics and Chemistry of Interfaces | author1 = Butt, Hans-Jürgen | author2 = Graf, Karlheinz | author3 = Kappl, Michael | year = 2003 | pages = 14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;math&gt;w_{(ring)}&lt;/math&gt; is the weight of the ring minus the buoyant force due to the part of the ring below the liquid surface.&lt;ref name="Lyklema"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=Fyy1fPVr4YAC&amp;pg=SA1-PA47|title=Fundamentals of Interface and Colloid Science: Liquid-Fluid Interfaces|last=Lyklema|first=J.|date=2000-07-10|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780080507132|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the ring's thickness is much smaller than its diameter, this equation can be simplified to:

&lt;math&gt;F= w_{(ring)} + 4\pi R \gamma&lt;/math&gt;

where R is the average of the inner and outer radius of the ring.&lt;ref name=Lyklema /&gt;

This technique was proposed by the French physicist [[Pierre Lecomte du Noüy]] (1883–1947) in a paper published in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = du Noüy, Pierre Lecomte | title = An Interfacial Tensiometer for Universal Use | journal = The Journal of General Physiology| year = 1925 | volume = 7 | pages = 625&amp;ndash;633 | url = http://jgp.rupress.org/cgi/reprint/7/5/625 | doi = 10.1085/jgp.7.5.625 | issue=5| pmc = 2140742 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The measurement is performed with a force [[Tensiometer (surface tension)|tensiometer]], which typically uses an [[Weighing scale#Electronic devices|electrobalance]] to measure the excess force caused by the liquid being pulled up and automatically calculates and displays the surface tension corresponding to the force. Earlier, torsion wire balances were commonly used. The maximum force is used for the calculations, and empirically determined correction factors are required to remove the effect caused by the finite diameter of the ring:

&lt;math&gt;F= w_{(ring)} + 4\pi R \gamma f&lt;/math&gt;

with f being the correction factor.

The most common correction factors include those by Zuidema and Waters (for liquids with low interfacial tension), Huh and Mason (which covers a wider range than Zuidema-Waters), and Harkins and Jordan (more precise than Huh-Mason while still covering the most widely used liquids).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=dOSZ2LsBJKgC&amp;pg=PA19|title=Effect of Temperature and Impurities on Surface Tension of Crude Oil|last=Udeagbara|first=Stephen Gekwu|date=2010-07-30|publisher=Universal-Publishers|isbn=9781599423555|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dual piping''' is a system of plumbing installations used to supply both [[potable water|potable]] and [[reclaimed water]] to a home or business.  Under this system, two completely separate water piping systems are used to deliver water to the user.  This system prevents mixing of the two water supplies, which is undesirable, since reclaimed water is usually not intended for human consumption.

In the [[United States]], reclaimed water is distributed in lavender (light purple) pipes, to alert users that the pipes contain non-potable water. Hong Kong has used a dual piping system for [[Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_Hong_Kong#Seawater_flushing|toilet flushing with sea water]] since the 1950s.

According to the El Dorado Irrigation District in California, the average dual-piped home used approximately {{convert|0.17|acre.ft|m3|lk=in}} of potable water in 2006.  The average single family residence with traditional piping using potable water for irrigation as well as for domestic uses used between {{convert|0.63|acre.ft|m3|lk=in}}, higher elevation, and {{convert|0.78|acre.ft|m3|lk=in}}, lower elevation.

The '''Eidoloscope''' was an early [[motion picture]] system created by [[Eugene Augustin Lauste]], [[Woodville Latham]] and his two sons through their business, the Lambda Company, in [[New York City]] in 1894 and 1895. The Eidoloscope was demonstrated for members of the press on April 21, 1895 and opened to the paying public on Broadway on May 20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Streible|first1=Dan|title=Fight Pictures: A History of Boxing and Early Cinema|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520940581|pages=46|url=https://books.google.cl/books?id=Bpc1fk5T5dYC&amp;pg=PA46|accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Originally called the Pantoptikon (also spelled 'Panoptikon'), it is perhaps the first [[widescreen]] film format, with an [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] of 1.85. It had a film gauge of 51&amp;nbsp;mm and an aperture of 37&amp;nbsp;mm by 20&amp;nbsp;mm. It was instrumental in the history of film in that it created what became known as the "[[Latham loop]]", which are two loops of film, one on each side of the [[intermittent movement]], which act as a buffer between continuously moving [[sprockets]] and the jerky motion of the intermittent movement. This relieved strain on the filmstrip and so enabled the shooting and projection of much longer motion pictures than had previously been possible.

==Early beginnings==
Woodville Latham, one of the creators of the eidoloscope, was originally a chemistry professor.&lt;ref&gt;Musser, C., "Projecting Motion Pictures: Invention", Vol. 1. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Woodville's sons were in the business of showing boxing matches and would frequently hear complaints from patrons about how someone should make a machine that projects film on a screen. That way, more people could view the film at the same time, unlike the [[kinetoscope]]. It was a much more efficient method of exhibition that would reduce start-up costs, since each parlor would need only one machine instead of six. [[William Kennedy Laurie Dickson|W.K.L Dickson]], an employee of Edison's at the same time, joined the Latham's and their project to help raise finances and the knowledge of how to move forward in the business.&lt;ref&gt;Musser, C., "Projecting Motion Pictures: Invention", Vol. 1. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;  The Eidoloscope was engineered mainly by Lauste, who also assisted with the design of the [[Latham loop]]. (Later, Dickson would credit Lauste with the loop's invention).

The Latham's named their company after the Greek letter for "L", [[lambda]].&lt;ref&gt;Musser, C., "Projecting Motion Pictures: Invention", Vol. 1.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21901">'''Elizabethan furniture''' is the form which the [[Renaissance]] took in [[England]] in furniture and general ornament, and in furniture it is as distinctive a form as its French and Italian counterparts.

== Gradual emergence ==

For many years [[Gothic architecture]] had been moving toward the low lines of the [[Tudor style architecture|Tudor style]], somewhat impelled by the widespread effects of the Italian [[trecento]].  Yet the physical and mental insularity of England made absolute change a very slow process, and it was not entirely achieved during the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]].  Thus instead of the exquisite lightness of the pointed and [[ogee]] arches, an arch from the time of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] barely lifts itself above the level of a straight lintel, under square spandrels.

The effects of the [[Renaissance]] spread slowly to England, although the [[Artists of the Tudor court]] included many immigrants from more advanced milieus.  [[Pietro Torrigiano]], [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Holbein]] and others were in touch with the latest movements on the Continent.

Long after that [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] finds occasion to speak of
{{cquote|...fashions of proud Italy, whose manners still our tardy apish nation limps after in base imitation.}}
[[Henry V (play)|King Hal]] himself having had a taste for novelty and splendor that leaned kindly to foreign fashions, and the pageantry of the era of [[James I of England|James I]], that "wisest fool in Europe," not having wrought immediate effect with the quips and conceits through which eventually the Elizabethan degenerated into the [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]].

And if the movement was tardy even then, it was still slower in the previous Tudor era&amp;nbsp;— that three-quarters of a century just preceding the precise Elizabethan.  In spite of a few articles of Renaissance furniture procured abroad for the royal family or some of the high nobility, a barbarous mixture of the old and new yet prevailed in England at the period when France enjoyed the accomplished [[Henry II style]], and when Italy reveled in the perfect fantasies of the Italian [[cinquecento]].

The term Elizabethan has been used distinctively in relation to the Renaissance, rather than exactly in relation to the English styles; for it really began some years before Elizabeth was born and extended over some years after she died, only then receiving its full development.  It is not quite possible to fix the exact limits of the different variations of any main style, one shade overlapping and blending with another.  Thus there are chairs with the exceedingly high and narrow backs and small square seats which are called Elizabethan, but which were in use with much the same ornament for an indefinite previous period, and there are palaces and country seats built in Elizabeth's last days, but decorated with the additional characteristics more particularly belonging to the Jacobean.  In the [[Louvre]] and old armory the upper portion is pierced in all the Gothic foliations of the [[Flamboyant]], while the lower portion is decorated with panels carved in all the richest caprices of the cinquecento.&lt;ref name='Harpers1877'&gt; {{cite journal|title=Elizabethan and later English furniture|journal=Harper's New Monthly Magazine|date=December 1877|first=|last=|coauthors=|volume=56|issue=331|pages=18–33|id= |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=coo.31924079630608;view=1up;seq=28|format=|accessdate=14 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classic influence ==

Attempts at classicism are everywhere in the Elizabethan.  Once in a while in a mantelpiece the attempt is almost a success, and the result an exceedingly stately and beautiful object with channeled columns, architrave, and frieze.  But poorly executed work has a few pillars and pilasters with misunderstood details, a strap often clasped and buckled about them, some clumsy scrolls and rosettes, with masks and busts of the ancients, scattered ill-drawn human figures, and here and there huge terms, heads rising from flat vases, or pedestals narrowing at the base.

[[Image:Great Bed of Ware 1877.png|thumb|The Great Bed in Saracen's Head.]]
[[Classical order|Grecian column]]s of singular disproportion form the main structure of bedsteads, tables, and cabinets.  These columns are noted for their clumsy thickness, and in one of the first misapprehensions of the classic that mark the style, they rise from huge spherical clusters of foliage, usually the [[Acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]].  At about half their length, these columns are frequently broken by another huge spherical cluster; on this sometimes half the foliage growing downward, half growing upward, and divided in the middle by a careful strap and buckle; occasionally the upper half of this globe is absent.  The lower part of the columns is often covered with [[Arabesque (European art)|arabesque]]s, and the upper half merely fluted, or else covered with a fine imbricate carving.  In some of the tables, instead of columns, a sort of [[caryatid]]&amp;nbsp;— female half-figure, neither exactly [[sphinx]] nor monster, dressed out in straps and ending in rude scrolls&amp;nbsp;— formed the support at each of the four corners.

The tables thus upheld were mighty constructions, sometimes they can be pulled apart in an extension, but oftener bound by firm crossbars and almost immovable through their weight.  In the cabinets the lower part was usually a closed cupboard, paneled and ornamented, with terms between the different divisions, the figure issuing from the vase being now a head only, and now two-thirds of the whole; the top projected, and was upheld by the big columns; and all the surfaces were enriched with sculptures after the approved fashion.

Of the bedsteads with heavy canopies and cornices, the [[Great Bed of Ware]] follows the styles, although it is a caricature in size.  Sir [[Toby Belch]] speaks of this piece of furniture when he advises Sir [[Andrew Aguecheek]]: "And as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of paper, although the sheet were big enough for the Bed of Ware in England, set 'em down; go about it."  Still, it is to be remembered that its twelve foot square size was not at all unusual, and was matched by other beds on the Continent.&lt;ref name='Harpers1877' /&gt;

Although its curious translation of classic shapes is significant, the strap and buckle predominate over everything else.&lt;ref name='Harpers1877' /&gt;

== Strap and buckle ==

Strapwork, together with shieldwork, was very prominent in the Henry II style.  It was a method of ornament particularly applicable to jewelry and work in gold.  [[Benvenuto Cellini|Cellini]] used it entirely. "I therefore made four small figures of boys," says he, "with four little grotesques, which completed the ring; and I added to it a few fruits and ''ligatures'' in enamel, so that the jewel and the ring appeared admirably suited to each other."  Both in the French and the Italian work the method was mingled with better classic detail, and with finer natural imitation, but hardly in the [[Saracenic]] itself was the tracery so prominent as in the Elizabethan.  If the type was meager, its play of line was infinite: curve led to curve, intricacy to intricacy, and over all ornamented surfaces, the scrolls that supported other forms&amp;nbsp;— panels or scutcheons or masks&amp;nbsp;— the figures, the faceted jewel forms, opened into successions and sequences of interlacing and escaping straps and ribbons, and transformed into the representation of all the gay buckling and harnessing of [[chivalry]].

These ribbons and straps and buckles were always flat in surface, however curved in shape and situation, and they rose from their background at right angles as actual straps would if laid on flatly, not using contrasts of light and shade, but seeking only the effect of line chasing line.  When the use of the [[cartouche]] became more general, one form of light and shade came to the assistance of this sort of ornament, for the supports of the shield were frequently pierced with countless openings, crescent-shaped, lozenged, circular, rectangular, apparently in a mere haphazard openwork, but revealed in an overall view as repeating the straps and ribbons again with the contours of their perforation.  While this pierced shieldwork, with its innumerable flat and curved planes, came afterward to assume more importance in the Jacobean, there was nothing of the Elizabethan that was not ornamented with the strapwork in some form or other.

[[Image:Francis Drake chair 1877.png|thumb|Chair made from Drake's ship]]

The vast screens between the sides of rooms or walls themselves were filled with flourishes of this carven tracery, as seen in [[Crewe Hall]].  Even of the ceilings conformed to the carved style.  There are few grander effects in interior decoration than the intersecting curves and angles of a lofty old Elizabethan ceiling.  Of course, in the use of the strap and shield, heraldry and its escutcheons and crests entered largely into the ornament of the Elizabethan.  The ensigns armorial, set in all shapes and surrounded by all the curious mantling to be devised, appeared everywhere in conjunction with the family motto and with the intertwined initials of husband and wife, over gateways, over doorways, on dead-wall, over the fireplace; and stairways were decorated with carved monsters sitting on the baluster-tops and holding before them the family arms, frequently looking as if they had just escaped from one of the quarterings.  Even such a room sometimes had stylistic mixtures such as wainscots which were set in the little square panels or in the parchment panels of the preceding reigns, or in the round-arched panels peculiar to the Elizabethan itself&amp;nbsp;— miniature and open representations of which are to be seen on the back of the chair made from the wood of Sir [[Francis Drake]]'s ship.  &lt;ref name='Harpers1877' /&gt;

== Absorbing of Gothic ==

Nevertheless, in the Elizabethan the Gothic is never quite forgotten.  Its vertical lines are always breaking through the horizontal of the invading classic; its reverend monsters look with special unkindness on the fantasticism of the new monsters that Cellini described as the promiscuous breed of animals and flowers; its ornaments insist upon their right before the Grecian; in architecture its gables still rise, although with a skyline gnawed out by the scrolls as worms gnaw out the sides of a leaf; and in furniture its cove surmounts the tops of those cabinets whose fronts are the facades of temples.  The steadfast English mind clung to the old order of things, and relinquished with reluctance the last relics of a style that had been for centuries a part of its life.  If it must have the egg and dart, it would keep the Tudor flower too.  Thus all the Renaissance that came into England, after the bloody [[Wars of the Roses]] made it possible to think of art and luxury, paid toll to the Gothic on the way, and the result was a singular miscellany, for its Gothic had now forgotten, and its Renaissance had never known why it had existed.  It is rather the talent with which the medley of material was handled, the broad masses, yet curious elaboration, and the scale of magnificence, that give the style its charm rather than anything in its original and bastard composition.&lt;ref name='Harpers1877' /&gt;

== Influence of the Low Countries ==

[[Image:Flemish table 1877.png|thumb|Flemish table.]]
The Renaissance of the Elizabethan came into England by way of the [[Low Countries]].  The importation of furniture into England from [[Flanders]] and [[Holland]] was so significant that a hundred years earlier a law was enacted forbidding the practice&amp;nbsp;— nevertheless carved woodwork was one of the important articles of commerce with the Low Countries, and the country homes of England of this period were filled with articles of Dutch and Flemish workmanship.

Historical influences include:
* Residence in England of numbers of exiles fleeing from Spanish oppression and events such as [[Sack of Antwerp]].
* The occupation of the Netherlands by English forces during the [[Dutch Revolt]].
* English sympathy with the struggles may have affected the fashion.
Whether from any of these causes or from purely commercial ones, what became part of the Elizabethan furniture style was the top-heavy and overloaded Dutch cabinet and the table with big columnar legs capable of upholding mighty serving dishes, and both covered with Flemish ornament.  Many forgeries in the style were made in Holland long afterward due to their high value.

It is this importation and custom that accounts for something of the character of the Elizabethan articles; for the Flemings, although fond of magnificence, and accustomed to all the splendor of the [[Burgundian Netherlands|Burgundian court]], never became absolute masters of the fully developed Italian style.  Nor was the Fleming so thoroughly the master of his materials that his execution quite answered his ideas.  Both German and Spanish workmanship came much nearer to the complete spirit of the Renaissance, the latter leaving little to be desired.  The Flemish is, however, generally held to be the most dramatic carving of the North.  Although the French handled the human figure lightly and fancifully their drawing was apt to be incorrect, such as in giving too much weight and size to the head.  Yet after some years the Flemish work became less dignified and desirable.  It was lumbered with turned work sawed in half and glued on, with panels overlaying and intersecting each other at odd angles, and with cumbrous pendants under the corners, all of which work was injurious, and much of which was ugly.  In the later period of the Elizabethan, the Italians themselves may have supplied artists and workmen for the furniture, but they must have worked hampered by the tastes and prejudices existing around them.  A certain rudeness of carving prevails throughout the earlier part of the style, and is considered to give breadth of effect.  The old carvers hid none of the means by which they gained their ends, and left even the tool marks in full sight.&lt;ref name='Harpers1877' /&gt;

== Scallop shell ==

In that portion of the Elizabethan which is often considered as the Jacobean, although it was but the completer development of the former, the globular excrescences of the columns elongated themselves into equally vast and far uglier acorn-shaped supports.  A good deal of inlaid work was then used, and the carving did its best to reach and render the ideas of the cinquecento.  It is, indeed, styled the cinquecento period of English art, every surface being rough with arabesques of [[griffin]]s, vases, rosettas, dolphins, scrolls, foliages, Cupids, and mermaids with double tails curling round them on either side.  Meantime the cartouche and its straps&amp;nbsp;— ''ligatures'' they were called in Italy, ''cuirs'' in France and Flanders, were still often used.  Scallop shells received a particular share of favor, having been recently brought home from foreign seas, and was immediately seized by the designers in need of other shapes. The Flemings made seats that enclosed the sitter in the valves of this scallop, carved just rudely enough to excuse their eccentricity.  Settees were made at this time whose backs consisted of several just such immense scallops as those of these [[Holland House, London|Holland House]] Gilt Chamber chairs; and the same idea of decoration peeps out in fan-like frills at every spare corner of the [[Jacobethan|Neo-Jacobean]] revival of the style.  These shell forms of furniture might befit an oceanside home, but they must have been singularly out of place on dry land and among the huge and heavy articles that surrounded them in the Jacobean mansions.

[[Image:Jacobean Court-cupboard 1877.png|thumb|Jacobean court-cupboard]]
There was something, on the whole, in the early Elizabethan replete with dignity, a massy magnificence that agreed with that of the era and the monarch, that went well, too, with the mighty farthingales and ruffs of the ladies, the trunk-hose and puffed and banded doublets of the gallants, while the people who used it&amp;nbsp;— Shakespeare, [[Walter Raleigh]], [[Ben Jonson]], [[Francis Bacon]]&amp;nbsp;— still have a peculiar interest.  Well as it suited doughy old Queen Bess herself, the forms which it took under her successor, with their assumption of foreign conceits and their display of profuse gilding, accorded no less characteristically with the arrogant, pedantic, and petty James.  All of this furniture, however, is exceedingly attractive, and there are few who would not rejoice over any article of it which is not too unwieldy for modern quarters.  A typical [[sideboard]] and dresser offer a medley of design, with not too well drawn fawns and satyrs, fruits and flowers, Cupids, birds, scrolls, shields and straps, cornucopias, mermaids, monsters and foliages.  They belong to the beginning of the later period.  It was no light matter to clear the floor for the dance of the [[Capulets]] when the servant cried "Away with the joint-stools, remove the court-cupboard, look to the plate!".&lt;ref name='Harpers1877' /&gt;

== Porcelain and mirrors ==

By the close of the Jacobean era, the style held its own with slight variation and innovation, for some reigns.  The execution of the carving was coarse and careless during the time of the first [[Stuarts#Kings_of_Great_Britain.2C_France_and_Ireland|Stuart]]s, but afterward rose to be classed with the finest known; inlaid work, also, was more freely used and attained much excellence.  There was increasing prevalent luxury in every thing.  Fine pottery, for instance, became more frequent; for although glass had been made in [[London]] under Elizabeth's patronage, "porselyn" was rare, and even earthenware was not then very general, gold and silver plate making the vessels of the rich, and pewter mugs and platters and wooden trenchers being still those of the poor, while mention is made of "five dishes of earth painted, such as are brought from Venice," which were presented to the queen as something unusual; and it was thought a gift not unworthy of royalty when [[Michael Balfour, 1st Lord Balfour of Burleigh|Lord Burleigh]] offered her a "porringer of white porselyn garnished with gold."  The first use of the famous Dutch tiles is thought to belong to the reign of Charles I.

[[Image:Elizabethan mirror 1877.png|thumb|Elizabethan mirror.]]
Mirrors, which were very rare in Elizabeth's time, became more common in that of the Charleses, the [[Duke of Buckingham]], during the reign of the second Charles, bringing a colony of Venetian glassmakers to [[Lambeth]].  One Elizabethan mirror is some three and a half by four and a half feet in size&amp;nbsp;— five feet was the largest made till the latter part of the eighteenth century&amp;nbsp;— the frame is carved in oak and partially gilt, and the glass is set flatly.  In one mirror of the time of Charles II the glass is beveled, and in the glasses of the Merry Monarch's predecessor the frames were so made as to throw the glass forward and give it projection.  Quicksilvered glass itself, unset, became a novelty, so that sometimes whole rooms, and even the ceilings, were lined with it.  The mirrors made by the duke's colony were of superior excellence; they had an inch-wide bevel all along their outer extremity, whether they were rectangular or curved.  "This," says Mr. Pollen, "gives preciousness and prismatic light to the whole glass.  It is of great difficulty in execution, the plate being held by the workman over his head, and the edge cut by grinding.  The feats of skill in this kind, in the form of interrupted curves and short lines and angles, are rarely accomplished by modern workmen, and the angle of the bevel itself is generally too acute, whereby the prismatic light produced by this portion of the mirror is in violent and too showy contrast to the remainder."

Wall hangings had been long in use&amp;nbsp;— the leather, the damask, velvent, and arras or tapestry.  The Flemish tapestries, from the time of their first manufacture, were in great favor.  Elizabeth had a set wrought signalizing the dispersion and destruction of the [[Spanish Armada]].  So fine had they become that they were often preferred to other decoration, and in the Stuart time were stretched across the noble old carved panelwork itself.  "Here I saw the new fabric of French tapestry," wrote Evelyn, in the last years of Charles II, concerning the [[Gobelins manufactory|Gobelins]] tapestry, established under the royal patronage in France: "for design, tenderness of work, and incomparable imitation of the best paintings, beyond any thing I had ever beheld.  Some pieces had [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], [[Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye|St. Germains]], and other palaces of the French king, with huntings, figures, and landscapes, exotic fowls, and all to the life rarely done."  Yet works in tapestry had been, long before this, under royal protection in England also, the Raphael cartoons having been purchased by Charles I for the use of the establishment at [[Mortlake]], which, however, did not outlast that sovereign more than half a century; and the employment of draperies had become so profuse that they now largely took the place of the heavy paneled wooden tops which had so long encumbered the bedsteads.&lt;ref name='Harpers1877' /&gt;

'''Ferrocement''' or '''ferro-cement''' (also called '''thin-shell concrete''' or '''ferro-concrete''') is a system of reinforced [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]]&lt;ref&gt;Gani, M. S. J. ''Cement and Concrete''. London: Chapman &amp; Hall, 1997. 8. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[plaster]] (lime or [[cement]], sand and water) applied over layer of metal [[mesh]], woven expanded-metal or metal-fibers and closely spaced thin steel rods such as [[rebar]]. The metal commonly used is iron or some type of steel. It is used to construct relatively thin, hard, strong surfaces and structures in many shapes such as [[Hull (watercraft)|hulls]] for boats, shell roofs, and water tanks. Ferrocement originated in the 1840s in France and is the origin of [[reinforced concrete]]. It has a wide range of other uses including sculpture and prefabricated building components. The term "ferrocement" has been applied by extension to other [[composite materials]], including some containing no cement and no ferrous material.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==Definitions==
''Cement'' and ''concrete'' are used interchangeably but there are technical distinctions and the meaning of ''cement'' has changed since the mid-nineteenth century when ''ferrocement'' originated. Ferro- means [[iron]] although metal commonly used in ferro-cement is the iron alloy [[steel]]. Cement in the nineteenth century and earlier meant ''mortar''&lt;ref&gt;
Chambers, William, and James Donald, eds. "cement", ''Chambers's Etymological Dictionary of the English Language''. London, Edinburgh: W. &amp; R. Chambers, 1873. 66. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; or broken stone or tile mixed with lime and water to form a strong mortar.&lt;ref&gt;"cement, n." ''Oxford English Dictionary''. 2nd. ed. 2009. CD-Rom.&lt;/ref&gt; Today cement usually means Portland cement,&lt;ref&gt;Ward-Harvey, K. ''Fundamental Building Materials''. 4th ed. Boca Raton, Fla: Universal-Publishers, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Mortar is a paste of a binder (usually Portland cement), sand and water; and concrete is a fluid mixture of Portland cement, sand, water and crushed stone [[Construction aggregate|aggregate]] which is poured into formwork (shuttering). ''Ferro-concrete'' is the original name of reinforced concrete (armored concrete) known at least since the 1890s and in 1903 it was well described in London's Society of Engineer's ''Journal''&lt;ref&gt;Augustus de Rohan Galbraith, "The [[François Hennebique|Hennebique]] System of Ferro-Concrete Construction". ''Journal'', P. F. Nursey, ed. Society of Engineers. London. E &amp; F. N.Spon. 1903. 177-208. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; but is now widely confused with ferrocement.

==History==
The inventors of ferrocement are Frenchmen [[Joseph Monier]] who dubbed it "ciment armé" (armored cement) and [[Joseph-Louis Lambot]] who constructed a [[batteau]] with the system in 1848.&lt;ref&gt;Nedwell, P. J.. ''Ferrocement: Proceedings of the Fifth International Symposium on Ferrocement''. UMIST, Manchester, 6–9 September 1994. London: E &amp; FN Spon, 1994. 28-30. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Lambot exhibited the vessel at the [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|Exposition Universelle]] in 1855 and his name for the material "ferciment" stuck. Lambot patented his batteau in 1855 but the patent was granted in Belgium and only applied to that country. At the time of Monier's first patent, July 1867, he planned to use his material to create urns, planters, and cisterns. These implements were traditionally made from [[ceramic]]s, but large-scale, kiln-fired projects were expensive and prone to failure. In 1875, Monier expanded his patents to include bridges and designed his first steel-and-concrete bridge. The outer layer was sculpted to mimic rustic logs and timbers, thereby also ushering [[Faux Bois]] (wood grain) concrete. In the first half of the twentieth century Italian [[Pier Luigi Nervi]] was noted for his use of ferro-cement, in Italian called ''ferro-cemento''.

"ferrocement" being referred to as ferro-concrete or [[reinforced concrete]] to better describe the end product instead of its components.

Ferro concrete has relatively good strength and resistance to impact. When used in house construction in developing countries, it can provide better resistance to fire, earthquake, and corrosion than traditional materials, such as wood, adobe and stone masonry. It has been popular in developed countries for yacht building because the technique can be learned relatively quickly, allowing people to cut costs by supplying their own labor. In the 1930s through 1950's, it became popular in the United States as a construction and [[Albert Vrana|sculpting]] method for [[novelty architecture]], examples of which created "[[Cabazon Dinosaurs|dinosaurs in the desert]]".

==Construction formwork ==
The desired shape may be built from a multi-layered construction of mesh, supported by an armature, or grid, built with [[rebar]] and tied with wire. For optimum performance, steel should be rust-treated, ([[galvanized]]) or [[stainless steel]]. (In early practice, in the desert, or for exterior scenery construction, "sound building practice" was not considered, or perhaps unknown as it grew in some cases, from a folk craft tradition of masons collaborating with blacksmiths.) Over this finished framework, an appropriate mixture ([[grout]] or [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]]) of [[Portland cement]], [[sand]] and [[water]] and/or [[Concrete#Chemical admixtures|admixtures]] is applied to penetrate the mesh. During hardening, the assembly may be kept moist, to ensure that the concrete is able to set and harden slowly and to avoid developing cracks that can weaken the system. Steps should be taken to avoid trapped air in the internal structure during the wet stage of construction as this can also create cracks that will form as it dries. Trapped air will leave voids that allow water to collect and degrade (rust) the steel. Modern practice often includes spraying the mixture at pressure (a technique called [[shotcrete]]) or some other method of driving out trapped air.

Older structures that have failed offer clues to better practices. In addition to eliminating air where it contacts steel, modern concrete additives may include acrylic liquid "[[Concrete#Chemical admixtures|admixtures]]" to slow moisture absorption and increase shock resistance to the hardened product or to alter curing rates. These technologies, borrowed from the commercial tile installation trade, have greatly aided in the restoration of these structures.&lt;ref&gt;fauxboisconcrete.info&lt;/ref&gt; Chopped glass or poly fiber can be added to reduce crack development in the outer skin. (Chopped fiber could inhibit good penetration of the grout to steel mesh constructions. This should be taken into consideration and mitigated, or limited to use on outer subsequent layers. Chopped fibers may also alter or limit some wet sculpting techniques.)

==Economics==
The economic advantage of ferro concrete structures is that they are stronger and more durable than some traditional building methods.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Depending on the quality of construction and the climate of its location, houses may pay for themselves with almost zero maintenance and lower insurance requirements. Water tanks could pay for themselves by not needing periodic replacement, if properly constructed of [[reinforced concrete]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

Ferro concrete structures can be built quickly, which can have economic advantages. In inclement weather conditions, the ability to quickly erect and enclose the building allows workers to shelter within and continue interior finishing.

In [[India]], ferro concrete is used often because the constructions made from it are more resistant to [[earthquakes]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Earthquake resistance is dependent on good construction technique and additional reinforcement of the concrete.

In the 1970s, designers adapted their [[yacht]] designs to the then very popular backyard building scheme of building a boat using ferrocement. Its big attraction was that for minimum outlay and costs, a reasonable application of skill, an amateur could construct a smooth, strong and substantial yacht hull.  A ferro-cement hull can prove to be of similar or lower weight than a [[fiber reinforced plastic]] (fiberglass), [[aluminum]], or [[steel]] hull.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} New methods of laminating layers of cement and steel mesh in a mold may bring new life to ferro-cement boat-building.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} A thorough examination of reinforced concrete and current practice would benefit the boat builder. An example of a well known ferro-cement boat is ''Hardiesse'', the Falmouth sail-training ship.

There are basically three types of methods of ferrocement. They are following

#Armature system: In this method the skeleton steel is welded to the desired shape on either of sides of which are tied several layers of stretched meshes. This is strong enough, so that mortar can be filled in by pressing for one side and temporarily supporting from the other side. Filling in of mortar can also be administered by pressing in the mortar from both the sides. In this method the skeletal steel (bars) are at centre of the section and as such they add to the dead weight of without any contribution to strength.
#Closed mould systems: Several layers of meshes are tied together against the surface of the mould which holds them in position while mortar is being filled in. The mould may be removed after curing or may remain in position as a permanent part of a finished structure. If the mould is to be removed for reuse, releasing agent must be used. 
#Integrated mould system: Using minimum reinforcement any integral mould is first to be considered to act as a framework. On this mould layers of meshes are fixed on either side and plastering is done onto them from both sides. As the name suggests, the mould remains permanently as an integral part of the finished structure. (e.g. double T-sections for flooring, roofing etc.) Precaution should be taken to have firm connection between the mould and the layers filled in later, so that finished product as a whole integral structural unit.

==Advantages==
The advantages of a well built ferro concrete construction are the low weight, maintenance costs and long lifetime in comparison with purely steel constructions.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, G and Sutherland, W. ''Concrete Boatbuilding''. George Allen and Unwin Ltd, 1969, p43&lt;/ref&gt; However, meticulous building precision is considered crucial here. Especially with respect to the cementitious composition and the way in which it is applied in and on the framework, and how or if the framework has been treated to resist corrosion.

When a ferro concrete sheet is mechanically overloaded, it will tend to fold instead of break or crumble like stone or pottery. As a container, it may fail and leak but possibly hold together.  Much depends on techniques used in the construction.

==Disadvantages==
The disadvantage of ferro concrete construction is the labor-intensive nature of it, which makes it expensive for industrial application in the western world. In addition, threats to degradation (rust) of the steel components is a possibility if air voids are left in the original construction, due to too dry a mixture of the concrete being applied, or not forcing the air out of the structure while it is in its wet stage of construction, through vibration, pressurized spraying techniques, or other means. These air voids can turn to pools of water as the cured material absorbs moisture. If the voids occur where there is untreated steel, the steel will rust and expand, causing the system to fail.

In modern practice, the advent of liquid acrylic additives and other advances to the grout mixture, create slower moisture absorption over the older formulas, and also increase bonding strength to mitigate these failures. Restoration steps should include treatment to the steel to arrest rust, using practices for treating old steel common in auto body repair.

'''Food technology''' is a branch of [[food science]] that deals with the production processes that [[Food manufacture|make foods]].

Early [[Food science|scientific research]] into food technology concentrated on [[food preservation]]. [[Nicolas Appert]]’s development in 1810 of the [[canning]] process was a decisive event.  The process wasn’t called canning then and Appert did not really know the principle on which his process worked, but canning has had a major impact on food preservation techniques.

[[Louis Pasteur]]'s research on the spoilage of [[wine]] and his description of how to avoid spoilage in 1864 was an early attempt to apply scientific knowledge to food handling.  Besides research into [[wine spoilage]], Pasteur researched the production of [[alcohol]], [[vinegar]], wines and [[beer]], and the [[Soured milk|souring of milk]]. He developed [[pasteurization]]—the process of heating milk and milk products to destroy food spoilage and disease-producing [[microorganisms|organisms]]. In his research into food technology, Pasteur became the pioneer into [[bacteria|bacteriology]] and of modern [[Preventive healthcare|preventive medicine]].

== Developments ==
[[File:Liofilizat 04 pl.jpg|thumb|right|[[Freeze-drying|Freeze-dried]] [[coffee]], a form of [[instant coffee]]]]

Developments in food technology have contributed greatly to the food supply and have changed our world. Some of these developments are: 
* [[Powdered milk|Instantized Milk Powder]] - D.D. Peebles (U.S. patent 2,835,586) developed the first instant milk powder, which has become the basis for a variety of new products that are rehydratable. This process increases the [[surface area]] of the powdered product by partially rehydrating spray-dried milk powder.
* [[Freeze-drying]] - The first application of freeze drying was most likely in the [[pharmaceutical]] industry; however, a successful large-scale industrial application of the process was the development of continuous freeze drying of coffee.
* [[Ultra-high temperature processing|High-Temperature Short Time Processing]] - These processes for the most part are characterized by rapid heating and cooling, holding for a short time at a relatively high temperature and filling aseptically into [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterile]] containers.
* [[Decaffeination]] of [[Coffee]] and [[Tea]] - Decaffeinated coffee and tea was first developed on a commercial basis in [[Europe]] around 1900. The process is described in U.S. patent 897,763. Green coffee beans are treated with water, heat and [[solvent]]s to remove the caffeine from the beans. 
* [[Process optimization]] - Food Technology now allows production of foods to be more efficient, Oil saving technologies are now available on different forms. Production methods and [[methodology]] have also become increasingly sophisticated.

== Consumer acceptance ==

In the past, consumer attitude towards food technologies was not common talk and was not important in food development. Nowadays the [[food chain]] is long and complicated, foods and food technologies are diverse; consequently the consumers are uncertain about the food quality and safety and find it difficult to orient themselves to the subject. 
That is why consumer acceptance of food technologies is an important question. However, in these days acceptance of food products very often depends on potential benefits and risks associated with the food. This also includes the technology the food is processed with. Attributes like "uncertain", "unknown" or "unfamiliar" are associated with consumers’ [[risk perception]] and consumer very likely will reject products linked to these attributes. Especially innovative food processing technologies are connected to these characteristics and are perceived as risky by consumers&lt;ref&gt;Ueland Ö, G. H., Holm, F., Kalogeras, N., Leino, O., Luteijn, J., Magnusson, S.(2011). State of the art in benefit-risk analysis: Consumer perception. Food and Chemical Toxicology, 52(1)&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Acceptance of the different food technologies is very different. Whereas pasteurisation is well recognised, high pressure treatment or even microwaves are perceived as risky very often. In studies done within Hightech Europe project, it was found that traditional technologies were well accepted in contrast to innovative technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hightecheurope.eu/documents.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121205013216/http://www.hightecheurope.eu/documents.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-12-05 |title=Documents |publisher=Hightecheurope.eu |date= |accessdate=2014-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consumers form their attitude towards innovative food technologies by three main factors mechanisms. First, knowledge or beliefs about risks and benefits which are correlated with the technology. Second, attitudes are based on their own experience and third, based on higher order values and beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, N. V., Grunert, K.G., &amp; Anne-Mette, S. (2010). Consumer acceptance of high-pressure processing and pulsed-electric field: a review. Trends in Food Science &amp; Technology, 21(446-472)&lt;/ref&gt;
A number of scholars consider the risk-benefit trade-off as one of the main determinants of consumer acceptance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frewer|first1=Lynn J.|last2=van der Lans|first2=Ivo A.|last3=Fischer|first3=Arnout R.H.|last4=Reinders|first4=Machiel J.|last5=Menozzi|first5=Davide|last6=Zhang|first6=Xiaoyong|last7=van den Berg|first7=Isabelle|last8=Zimmermann|first8=Karin L.|title=Public perceptions of agri-food applications of genetic modification – A systematic review and meta-analysis|journal=Trends in Food Science &amp; Technology|date=April 2013|volume=30|issue=2|pages=142–152|doi=10.1016/j.tifs.2013.01.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;, although some researchers place more emphasis on the role of benefit perception (rather than risk) in consumer acceptance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gaskell|first1=George|last2=Allum|first2=Nick|last3=Wagner|first3=Wolfgang|last4=Kronberger|first4=Nicole|last5=Torgersen|first5=Helge|last6=Hampel|first6=Juergen|last7=Bardes|first7=Julie|title=GM Foods and the Misperception of Risk Perception|journal=Risk Analysis|date=February 2004|volume=24|issue=1|pages=185–194|doi=10.1111/j.0272-4332.2004.00421.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Rogers (2010) defines five major criteria that explain differences in the acceptability or adoption of new technology by consumers: complexity, compatibility, relative advantage, trialability and observability&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rogers|first1=Everett M.|title=Diffusion of Innovations|date=2010|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0743222099|edition=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Acceptance of innovative technologies can be improved by providing non-emotional and concise information about these new technological processes methods. According to a study made by HighTech project also written information seems to have higher impact than audio-visual information on the consumer in case of sensory acceptance of products processed with innovative food technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hightecheurope.eu/documents.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121205013216/http://www.hightecheurope.eu/documents.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-12-05 |title=Documents |publisher=Hightecheurope.eu |date= |accessdate=2014-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1450">'''Gross Merchandise Volume''' (alternatively Gross Merchandise Value or '''GMV''') is a term used in [[online retailing]] to indicate a total sales dollar value for merchandise sold through a particular marketplace over a certain time frame. Site revenue comes from fees and is different from the dollar value of items sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gross-merchandise-value.asp|title=Gross Merchandise Value|last=Staff|first=Investopedia|date=2008-11-01|work=Investopedia|access-date=2018-06-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GMV for e-commerce retail companies means sale price charged to the customer multiplied by the number of items sold. For example, if a company sells 10 books at $100, the GMV is $1,000. This is also considered as "gross revenue". In this case, the business model is based on a retail model, where the company basically purchases the items, maintains inventory (if need be) and finally, sells or delivers the items to customers. It does not tell the net sales as GMV does not include discounts, costs involved and returns of products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/tech/e-commerce/article/2119589/explainer-what-gmv-gross-merchandise-volume|title=Explainer: What is the big deal about gross merchandise volume?|work=South China Morning Post|access-date=2018-06-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''HeiQ Materials AG''' (German pronunciation:  [ˈhaɪkju]) is a Swiss specialty chemistry company, headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland. It was founded in 2005 as a [[University spin-off|spin-off]] of [[Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH)]].

HeiQ produces and sells textile finishing and other [[Speciality chemicals|auxiliaries]]. But its core business activity is to conduct co-joint research and development projects with consumer textile products brands or textile producers for [[textile finishing]] to achieve effects that are currently not in market or not optimized to certain products.

For the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]] that began in April 2010 in the [[Gulf of Mexico]], HeiQ, TWE Group and Beyond Surface Technologies jointly developed an oil-absorbing, water-repelling, nonwoven fabric, in the name Oilguard &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oilguard.org/|title=Oilguard|website=oilguard.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.handelszeitung.ch/unternehmen-1473|title=Handelszeitung.ch {{!}} Aktuelle Nachrichten und Hintergründe zu Wirtschaft, Politik und Börsen|access-date=2016-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; for oil relief efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/idAFLDE65S0UX20100629|title=Swiss firm has plan to save coastlines from oil|first=Reuters|last=Editorial|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The product was intended for beach protection against oil spills and was applied to the shoreline. This allows for the fabric to absorb crude oil while repelling the seawater. This innovation was rewarded the Swiss Technology Award (2010)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.land-der-erfinder.ch/?p=7815|title=Die Erfindung Oilguard von HeiQ {{!}} Land der Erfinder – Das Schweizer Magazin für Innovationen|website=www.land-der-erfinder.ch|access-date=2016-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nzz.ch/oilguard-vliesstoff-erhaelt-auszeichnung-1.8276869|title=Swiss Technology Award für HeiQ: Oilguard-Vliesstoff erhält Auszeichnung|date=2010-11-04|newspaper=Neue Zürcher Zeitung|language=de-CH|issn=0376-6829|access-date=2016-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Swiss Award (2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Friedenskämpferin Bineta Diop gewinnt "SwissAward"|date=2013-01-11|url=http://www.srf.ch/sendungen/unterhaltungssendungen/events-shows/swissaward/friedenskaempferin-bineta-diop-gewinnt-swissaward-2|publisher=Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen SRF|language=de-CH|accessdate=2016-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.venturelab.ch/index.cfm?page=133022&amp;article_id=1040|title=HeiQ-Gründer für den Swiss Award nominiert|website=www.venturelab.ch|access-date=2016-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The water-repelling property of Oilguard is achieved with a textile finishing that creates the [[Lotus effect|Lotus Effect]] on the surface of the [[non-woven]] fabric. The [[Fluorine|non-fluorinated]] finishing makes the fabric only water repellent but not oil repellent, therefore the fabric absorbs oil crudes but not the seawater.

The company also has three subsidiaries in the United States, Hong Kong and Australia, known as HeiQ ChemTex, HeiQ Ltd. and HeiQ Australia Pty. Ltd. respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heiq.com|title=HeiQ Materials AG – SWISS TECH INSIDE|website=www.heiq.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Original research|date=September 2007}}

'''Ingenuity''' is the quality of being clever, original, and inventive, often in the process of applying ideas to solve problems or meet challenges.

== Etymology ==
Ingenuity (Ingenium) is the root Latin word for [[engineering]]. For example, the process of figuring out how to cross a mountain stream using a fallen log, building an [[airplane]] model from a sheet of paper, or starting a new company in a foreign culture all involve the exercising of ingenuity. Human ingenuity has led to various technological developments through [[applied science]], and can also be seen in the development of new [[social organization]]s, institutions, and relationships. Ingenuity involves the most complex human [[thought process]]es, bringing together our thinking and acting both individually and collectively to take advantage of opportunities and/or overcome problems.

== Application ==
One example of how ingenuity is used conceptually can be found in the analysis of [[Thomas Homer-Dixon]], building on that of [[Paul Romer]], to refer to what is usually called ''[[instructional capital]]''. In this case, Homer-Dixon used the phrase 'ingenuity gap' denotes the space between a challenge and its solution. His particular contribution is to explore the [[social dimension]]s of ingenuity. Typically we think of ingenuity being used to build faster computers or more advanced medical treatments.

Homer-Dixon argues that as the complexity of the world increases, our ability to solve the problems we face is becoming critical. Human ingenuity is also included in many school systems, with most teachers encouraging students to be educated in human ingenuity.

These challenges require more than improvements arising from physics, chemistry and biology, as one will need to consider the highly complex interactions of individuals, institutions, cultures, and networks involving all of the human family around the globe. Organizing ourselves differently, communicating and making decisions in new ways, are examples of social ingenuity. If one's ability to generate adequate solutions to these problems is inadequate, the ingenuity gap will lead to a wide range of social problems. The full exploration of these ideas in meeting social challenges is featured in ''The Ingenuity Gap''[http://www.ingenuitygap.com/], one of Thomas Homer-Dixon's earliest books.

In another of Homer-Dixon's books, [[The Up Side of Down]][http://www.theupsideofdown.com/], he argues that increasingly expensive oil, driven by scarcity, will lead to great social instability. Walking across an empty room requires very little ingenuity. If the room is full of snakes, hungry bears, and land mines, the ingenuity requirement will have gone up considerably.

== Discussion/Argument ==
[[Wiktionary:Ingenuity|Ingenuity]] is often inherent in [[creativity|creative]] individuals, and thus is considered hard to separate from [[individual capital]].

It is not clear though if Dixon or Romer considered it impossible to do so, or if they were simply not familiar with the prior analysis of "applied ideas", "[[intellectual capital]]", "talent", or "[[innovation]]" where instructional and individual contributions have been carefully separated, by [[economic theorist]]s.

'''Intelligent Machines Research Corporation''' (IMR) was founded by [[David H. Shepard]] and [[William Lawless, Jr.]] in 1952 to commercialize the work Shepard had done with the help of [[Harvey Cook]] in building "Gismo", a machine later called the "Analyzing Reader".

[[IBM]] obtained a license on IMR's patents in 1953 and in 1955 contracted with IMR to build a developmental system which was able to read constrained hand printed numeric characters if reasonably well formed. However, IBM did not market this system. In 1959 IBM did market a system of its own, classifying it as an [[Optical Character Recognition]] (OCR) system, and the term OCR from then on has been standard in the industry for this technology.

IMR went on to deliver the world's first several commercially used systems, including one used by [[Readers Digest]] in its book subscription department. Readers Digest donated this system many years later to [[Smithsonian Institution|the Smithsonian]], where it was once put on display. The second system was sold to the [[Standard Oil Company]] of [[California]], as arranged by the [[Farrington Manufacturing Company]], a leading company in the credit card business at that time, with many systems to read oil company credit cards to follow, one of which was also on display at the Smithsonian later on.

In 1959 Farrington acquired IMR, and the numeric font designed by Shepard, called Farrington 7B, has been standard for most of the well known credit cards since that time. Shepard later left Farrington and founded [[Cognitronics Corporation]] in 1962.&lt;ref name="NT"&gt;{{cite news |title= David H.

Both Shepard and Lawless had been [[NSA]] employees at one time. Lawless later held key positions in IBM.

A '''linear compressor''' is a [[gas compressor]] where the piston moves along a linear track to minimize friction and reduce energy loss during conversion of motion. This technology has been successfully used in cryogenic applications which must be oilless.

==History==
A number of patents for linear compressors powered by [[free-piston engine]]s were issued in the 20th century, including:
* To [[Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie]], GB191215963, published 1913-10-08&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?CC=GB&amp;NR=191215963A&amp;KC=A&amp;FT=D&amp;ND=3&amp;date=19131008&amp;DB=EPODOC&amp;locale=en_EP|title=Espacenet : Original document|website=Worldwide.espacenet.com|accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To [[Hugo Junkers]], CA245708, published 1924-12-30&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?CC=CA&amp;NR=245708A&amp;KC=A&amp;FT=D&amp;ND=3&amp;date=19241230&amp;DB=EPODOC&amp;locale=en_EP|title=Espacenet : Original document|website=Worldwide.espacenet.com|accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To [[Raúl Pateras Pescara]], US1615133, published 1927-01-18&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?CC=US&amp;NR=1615133A&amp;KC=A&amp;FT=D&amp;ND=3&amp;date=19270118&amp;DB=&amp;locale=en_EP|title=Espacenet : Original document|website=Worldwide.espacenet.com|accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first market introduction of a linear compressor to compress [[refrigerant]] in a [[refrigerator]] was in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohio.edu/mechanical/thermo/Intro/Chapt.1_6/refrigerator/refrig_problems.html|title=Problems 4.7 - A Home Refrigerator (updated 3/15/13)|website=Ohio.edu|accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Valved linear compressor==
The single piston linear compressor uses dynamic counterbalancing, where an auxiliary movable mass is flexibly attached to a movable piston assembly and to the stationary compressor casing using auxiliary mechanical springs with zero vibration export at minimum electrical power and current consumed by the motor.&lt;ref name="Reed et al 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cryogenics.2005.03.007 |title=Development of a valved linear compressor for a satellite borne J–T cryocooler |journal=Cryogenics |volume=45 |issue=7 |pages=496–500 |year=2005 |last1=Reed |first1=Jaime |last2=Dadd |first2=Mike |last3=Bailey |first3=Paul |last4=Petach |first4=Michael |last5=Raab |first5=Jeff |bibcode=2005Cryo...45..496R }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in [[cryogenic]]s.&lt;ref name="Reed et al 2005"/&gt;

Linear compressors are used in LG and Kenmore refrigerators.  Compressors of this type have less noise, and are more energy efficient than conventional refrigerator compressors.

'''M-Modules''' are a [[Daughterboard|mezzanine]] standard mainly used in industrial computers. Being mezzanines, they are always plugged on a carrier PCB that supports this format. The modules communicate with their carrier over a dedicated bus, and can have all kinds of special functions.

M-Modules are standardized as [[ANSI]]/VITA 12-1996 and are especially suited for adding any kind of real-world I/O to a system in a flexible way. They are modular I/O extensions for all types of industrial computers, from embedded systems up to high-end workstations. The M-Module Interface - a fast asynchronous parallel interface - offers sophisticated functions like 32-bit data bus, burst transfers up to 100 MB/s, DMA and trigger capabilities. M-Modules also offer direct front-panel connection rather than requiring a separate adapter panel with ribbon-cable connections. This provides a clean path for sensitive signals without loss of data or signal quality - using, for example, shielded D-Sub connectors and [[coaxial cable]]s.

==M-Module Introduction==
The mezzanine approach to placing multiple functions in a single card slot has been around for a long time both in proprietary and open standard forms. Valid arguments can be put forth for both of these approaches. The M-Module is one open standard that is gaining increasing popularity for applications in the fields of analog and digital I/O, instrumentation, robotics, motion functions and fieldbuses.  This standard was originally developed in Germany by MEN Mikro Elektronik for VMEbus applications and was soon expanded to support the CompactPCI bus as well. It has been embraced as [[ANSI]]/VITA 12-1996.  

[[Image:M-modules-measurement-spec.jpg]]

In addition to the single wide form shown, M-Modules can be developed in double, triple and quadruple wide configurations. Because of the standard's genesis in the [[vme bus|VME]] world it is sized such that 4 fit in a 6U module and 2 in a 3U module. Conveniently, because of the way other backplane standards have evolved, 4 units easily fit the front panel space in [[VXI]] and 6U [[cPCI]]/[[PXI]] while 2 will fit in the front panel space of 3U [[cPCI]]/PXI and up to 8 will fit in a 1U [[LAN eXtensions for Instrumentation|LXI]] rack mount carrier.

At the present time a number of instruments are available in the M-Module form factor in the following categories:

*Pulse Generators
*Function Generators
*Arbitrary Waveform Generators
*Digital Word Generators
*Digital Multi-meters
*Counter/Timers
*Rubidium Sources
*OCXO's
*GPS Timing Receivers
*Distribution Amplifiers
*Precision Voltage Sources
*MIL-STD-1553, CANbus, ARINC429
*Switching Modules
*Serial, Analog &amp; Digital I/O

A significant advantage to the M-Module is that it has a relatively straight forward set of electrical and mechanical specifications. This enables an engineer to design a function that might be required without having to become an expert on VXI, PXI or LXI as carriers are available to allow the design to be ported to the [[backplane]] or bus of the test system in use.

==Supporting the Standard==
As with any mezzanine card, a means must be provided through which the card may be adapted to a backplane or higher level interface. Such a device is generally referred to as a carrier. These come in two types: non-intelligent and intelligent. The functions performed by the former include the simpler functions such as mounting and providing power as well as the more complex such as providing translation between bus types, protocols, routing of triggers and interrupts and making each mezzanine appear as a separate instrument to the host backplane. Intelligent carriers will generally perform all of the functions of the non-intelligent plus perform pre or post processing of data, allow the combination of multiple instruments into composite instruments that then may be controlled at a higher level, and perform translation of commands from older instruments so as to facilitate replacement of Legacy instruments.

Of equal or greater importance in the support of the mezzanine is the software. The majority of the M-Module instrument types referenced above come with VXI/PXI Plug-and-Play or IVI drivers. However, a number of the more control oriented M-Modules are supported only with C drivers. Actions are underway that are described below which allow application of the [[Plug-and-Play]] drivers across multiple platforms.

==Benefits of Modularity==
Perhaps the greatest advantage of an M-Module mezzanine instrument is the ability of both the vendor and the user to become "Platform Agnostic". From the vendor's perspective, it is only necessary to develop one instrument, say a Pulse Generator, and with the use of carriers he can produce the same product into VXI, PXI, VME, LXI and other applications. This greatly reduces development costs when compared to the development of pulse generators for multiple buses.

'''Operation CHAOS''' or '''Operation MHCHAOS''' was the code name ([[CIA cryptonym]]) of a [[United States]] [[Central Intelligence Agency]] domestic espionage project targeting the American people from 1967 to 1974, established by [[Lyndon B. Johnson|President Johnson]] and expanded under [[Richard Nixon|President Nixon]], whose mission was to uncover possible foreign influence on domestic race, anti-war and other protest movements. The operation was launched under [[Director of Central Intelligence]] (DCI) [[Richard Helms]] by chief of [[counter-intelligence]] [[James Jesus Angleton]], and headed by [[Richard Ober]]. &lt;ref name="Theoharis06"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Central Intelligence Agency: Security Under Scrutiny |last=Athan Theoharis |first=Richard H. |year=2006 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=0-313-33282-7 |pages=49,175,195,203,322}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Napoli05"&gt;{{cite book|title=Intelligence Identities Protection Act and Its Interpretation |first=Russell P. |last=Napoli |publisher=Nova Publishers |year=2005 |isbn=1-59454-685-1 |pages=18–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "MH" designation is to signify the program had a worldwide area of operations.&lt;ref name="Friedman05"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Secret Histories: Hidden Truths That Challenged the Past and Changed the World |first=John S. |last=Friedman |year=2005 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=0-312-42517-1 |pages=278–279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The CIA began domestic recruiting operations in 1959 in the process of finding [[Cuba]]n exiles who could be used in the [[Cuban Project|campaign]] against communist Cuba and President [[Fidel Castro]]. As these operations expanded, the CIA formed a [[Domestic Operations Division]] in 1964. In 1965, US President [[Lyndon Johnson]] requested that the CIA begin its own investigation into domestic dissent—independent of the FBI's ongoing [[COINTELPRO]].&lt;ref name=Lyon&gt;Verne Lyon, "Domestic Surveillance: The History of Operation CHAOS", ''[[Covert Action Information Bulletin]]'', Summer 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

The CIA developed numerous operations targeting American dissents in the US.  Many of these programs operated under the [[Organizational structure of the Central Intelligence Agency#Directorate of Support|CIA's Office of Security]], including:&lt;ref name="Napoli05" /&gt;
*[[HTLINGUAL]] – Directed at letters passing between the United States and the then Soviet Union; the program involved the examination of correspondence to and from individuals or organizations placed on a watchlist.
*Project 2 – Directed at infiltration of foreign intelligence targets by agents posing as dissident sympathizers and which, like CHAOS, had placed agents within domestic radical organizations for the purposes of training and establishment of dissident credentials.
*[[Project MERRIMAC]] – Designed to infiltrate domestic antiwar and radical organizations thought to pose a threat to security of CIA property and personnel.
*[[Project RESISTANCE]] – Worked with college administrators, campus security and local police to identify anti-war activists and [[political dissident]]s without any infiltration taking place.

==Scale of operations==

When President [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] came to office in 1969, existing domestic surveillance activities were consolidated into Operation CHAOS.&lt;ref name="Goldstein01"&gt;{{cite book|title=Political Repression in Modern America: From 1870 to 1976 |first=Robert Justin |last=Goldstein |year=2001 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |isbn=0-252-06964-1 |page=456}}&lt;/ref&gt; Operation CHAOS first used CIA stations abroad to report on antiwar activities of United States citizens traveling abroad, employing methods such as physical surveillance and electronic [[eavesdropping]], utilizing "liaison services" in maintaining such surveillance. The operations were later expanded to include 60 officers.&lt;ref name="Friedman05" /&gt; In 1969, following the expansion, the operation began developing its own network of [[informants]] for the purposes of infiltrating various foreign antiwar groups located in foreign countries that might have ties to domestic groups.&lt;ref name="Napoli05" /&gt; Eventually, CIA officers expanded the program to include other leftist or counter-cultural groups with no discernible connection to [[Vietnam]], such as groups operating within the [[History of feminism#Late twentieth century: the postwar period and the second wave|women's liberation movement]].&lt;ref name="Theoharis06" /&gt; The domestic spying of Operation CHAOS also targeted the [[Israel]]i embassy, and domestic [[Jew]]ish groups such as the [[B'nai B'rith]]. In order to gather intelligence on the embassy and B'nai B'rith, the CIA purchased a [[Waste collection|garbage collection]] company to collect documents that were to be destroyed.&lt;ref name="Loftus97"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Secret War Against the Jews: How Western Espionage Betrayed The Jewish People |first=John |last=Loftus |author2=Mark Aarons |publisher=St. Martin's Griffin |date=April 15, 1997 |isbn=0-312-15648-0 |page=322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Targets of Operation CHAOS within the antiwar movement included:&lt;ref name="Goldstein01" /&gt;
*[[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]]
*[[Black Panther Party]]
*[[Young Lords]]
*[[Women Strike for Peace]]
*[[Ramparts Magazine]]&lt;ref&gt;Burn Before Reading, Stansfield Turner, 2005, Hyperion. p 118&lt;/ref&gt;

At its finality, Operation CHAOS contained files on 7,200 Americans, and a computer index totaling 300,000 civilians and approximately 1,000 groups.&lt;ref name="Hixson00"&gt;{{cite book|title=Military Aspects of the Vietnam Conflict |first=Walter L. |last=Hixson |isbn=0-8153-3534-2 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2000 |page=282}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Findings==
The aim of the programs was to compile reports on "illegal and subversive" contacts between United States civilian protesters and "foreign elements" which "might range from casual contacts based merely on mutual interest to closely controlled channels for party directives."&lt;ref name="Hixson00"&gt;{{cite book|title=Military Aspects of the Vietnam Conflict |first=Walter L. |last=Hixson |isbn=0-8153-3534-2 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2000 |page=282}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

DCI [[Richard Helms]] informed President Johnson on November 15, 1967, that the CIA had uncovered "no evidence of any contact between the most prominent peace movement leaders and foreign embassies in the U.S. or abroad."

A '''pipe cleaner''' or '''chenille stem''' is a type of [[brush]] originally intended for removing moisture and residue from [[smoking pipe (tobacco)|smoking pipe]]s.  Besides cleaning pipes, they can be used for any application that calls for cleaning out small bores or tight places.  Special pipe cleaners are manufactured specifically for cleaning out medical apparatus and for engineering applications. They are popular for winding around bottle necks to catch drips, bundling things together, colour-coding, and applying paints, oils, solvents, greases, and similar substances. They can also be used like a [[twist tie]].

==Description==
Smoking pipe cleaners normally use some absorbent material, usually [[cotton]] or sometimes [[viscose]]. Bristles of stiffer material, normally monofilament [[nylon]] or [[polypropylene]] are sometimes added to better scrub out what is being cleaned.  Microfilament [[polyester]] is used in some technical pipe cleaners because polyester wicks liquid away rather than absorbing it as cotton does.  Some smoking pipe cleaners are made [[cone (geometry)|conical]] or [[tapered]] so that one end is thick and one end thin.  The thin end is for cleaning the small bore of the pipe stem and then the thick end for the bowl or the wider part of the stem. When used for cleaning purposes, pipe cleaners are normally discarded after one or two uses.

==Crafts==
Pipe cleaners are commonly used in [[arts and crafts]] projects. "Craft" pipe cleaners are usually made with [[polyester]] or [[nylon]] pile and are often longer and thicker than the "cleaning" type, and available in many different colors.  Craft pipe cleaners are not very useful for cleaning purposes, because the polyester does not absorb liquids, and the thicker versions may not even fit down the stem of a normal pipe or into the usual hard-to-access area of applications that call for cleaning small bores or tight places.
In Japan, crafting with pipe cleaners is known as Mogol art. Its name derived from the Portuguese word Mughal for a style of weaving.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.craftjam.jp/en/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; Workshops in malls and schools in Japan have been led by Atushi Kitanaka on an effort to support the pipe cleaner industry. [[Ikuyo Fujita]]（藤田育代 ''Fujita Ikuyo''）is a Japanese artist who works primarily in [[Felt#Needle felting|needle felt painting]] and mogol (pipe cleaner) art. Use of pipe cleaners as an art format where animals &lt;ref&gt;https://www.yahoo.com/news/photos/pipe-cleaner-artist-1384892399-slideshow/?ref=gs&lt;/ref&gt; are made by twisting pipe cleaners together. They can also be used to create whiskers for an animal [[mask]] or nose.

==Manufacture==
A pipe cleaner is made of two lengths of wire, called the core, twisted together trapping short lengths of fibre between them, called the pile.  Pipe cleaners are usually made two at a time, as the inner wires of each pipe cleaner have the yarn wrapped around them, making a coil, the outer wires trap the wraps of yarn, which are then cut, making the tufts.  [[Chenille fabric|Chenille]] yarn is made in much the same way, which is why craft pipe cleaners are often called "chenille stems". The word chenille comes from French meaning caterpillar. Some pipe cleaner machines are actually converted chenille machines.  Some machines produce very long pipe cleaners which are wound onto spools.  The spools may be sold as-is or cut to length depending on the intended use.  Other machines cut the pipe cleaners to length as they come off the machines.  Smoking pipe cleaners are usually 15 – 17&amp;nbsp;cm (6 – 7&amp;nbsp;inches) long.  Craft ones are often  30&amp;nbsp;cm (12&amp;nbsp;inches) and can be up to 50&amp;nbsp;cm (20&amp;nbsp;inches).The diameter comes in 4&amp;nbsp;mm; 6&amp;nbsp;mm; and 15&amp;nbsp;mm sizes&lt;ref&gt;http://kwikcrafts.com/crafts/category/Pipe-Cleaners.html&lt;/ref&gt; Jumbo pipe cleaners have a 30&amp;nbsp;mm diameter with lengths of 18 inches and 6.5 feet.

'''ReserveAmerica&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;''', owned by [https://aspiraconnect.com/ Aspira]&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; is a product that provides [https://www.reserveamerica.com/ online campsite reservation] and license processing for federal, state, provincial, private and local government park, campground, and conservation agencies in [[North America]].  It claims to be the "#1 Access Point for Outdoor Recreation,"  processing more than 3.5 million camping reservations per year, with more than 150,000 campsites available.

==History==
ReserveAmerica was founded in 1984 as a [[software development]] company specializing in reservations for the local recreation industry. In 1992, the company developed a reservation system for state and federal park systems, which they claim processed the industry's first online reservation in September, 1997. ReserveAmerica has provided reservations services for the [[National Park Service]] since 1997. In 2001, they were acquired by [[InterActiveCorp]] (IAC), which owns [[Ask.com]], [[Citysearch]] and [[Match.com]]. 

In June, 2005, the [[United States Forest Service]] awarded the company a $97 million contract to provide a single source federal recreation information and reservation service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://fcw.com/articles/2005/06/21/forest-service-again-awards-recreation-contract-to-reserve-america.aspx | title= Forest Service again awards recreation contract to Reserve America| publisher= FCW | accessdate=September 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of September 2014, the reservation service offers centralized information for more than 100,000 campgrounds, cabins, parks and tours of national sites, historic homes and caves through a single [[World Wide Web|Web-based]] portal.  Besides the Forest Service, participating agencies include the National Park Service, the [[Bureau of Land Management]], the [[Bureau of Reclamation]] and the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]]. ReserveAmerica also has some state parks contracts.

In 2009, IAC sold ReserveAmerica to ACTIVE Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/iac-sells-reserveamerica-to-active-network-in-stock-swap/|title=IAC Sells ReserveAmerica To Active Network In Stock Swap|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=September 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the Communities and Sports divisions of ACTIVE Network were acquired by [[Global Payments]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://investors.globalpaymentsinc.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=1035835|title=Global Payments to Acquire ACTIVE Network; Announces Strategic Partnership with Vista Equity Partners (NYSE:GPN)|website=investors.globalpaymentsinc.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ACTIVE Network's Outdoors division, including ReserveAmerica, became the independent company, [https://aspiraconnect.com/ Aspira]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20171214006158/en/Aspira-Launches-30-Years-Expertise-Industry-Insight|title=Aspira Launches with More Than 30 Years of Expertise and Industry Insight in the Outdoor Recreation Space|website=www.businesswire.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The "Sun Watcher using Active Pixel System Detector and Image Processing" ('''SWAP''') telescope is a compact EUV imager on board the [[Proba-2|PROBA2]] mission that will observe the Sun in extreme ultraviolet (EUV). 
SWAP will provide images of the solar corona at a temperature of roughly 1 million degrees. This instrument was built upon the heritage of the Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope  ([[Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope|EIT]]) which monitors the solar corona since 1996.

SWAP will continue the systematic CME ([[coronal mass ejection]]) watch program at an improved image cadence (typically 1 image every minute). With this higher cadence, SWAP will monitor events in the low [[Corona|solar corona]] that might be relevant for space weather. These events include EIT waves (global waves propagating across the solar disc from the CME eruption site), EUV dimming regions (transient coronal holes from where the CME has lifted off) and filament instabilities (a specific type of flickering during the rise of a filament). SWAP will also take advantage of offpointings provided by the agility featured of  [[Proba-2|PROBA2]] platform to follows coronal mass ejections.

SWAP was built at the [[:fr:Centre spatial de Liège|Centre Spatial de Liege]] and will be operated from the PROBA-2 Science Center at the [[Royal Observatory of Belgium]].

SWAP has been used to study coronal brightspot dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kalugodu|first=Chandrashekhar|last2=S Krishna Prasad|first2=·|last3=Banerjee|first3=Dipankar|last4=Ravindra|first4=B|last5=Seaton|first5=D|date=2013-01-01|title=Dynamics of Coronal Bright Points as Seen by Sun Watcher Using Active Pixel System Detector and Image Processing (SWAP), Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), and Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) PROBA2 – First Two Years of Solar Observation Guest Editors|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259619424_Dynamics_of_Coronal_Bright_Points_as_Seen_by_Sun_Watcher_Using_Active_Pixel_System_Detector_and_Image_Processing_SWAP_Atmospheric_Imaging_Assembly_AIA_and_Helioseismic_and_Magnetic_Imager_HMI_PROBA2_-|journal=Solar Physics|volume=286|pages=125–142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''S band''' is a designation by the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) for a part of the [[microwave]] [[radio band|band]] of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] covering  [[frequency|frequencies]] from 2 to 4&amp;nbsp;[[gigahertz]] (GHz).  Thus it crosses the conventional boundary between the [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] and [[Super high frequency|SHF]] bands at 3.0&amp;nbsp;GHz. The S band is used by [[airport surveillance radar]] for [[air traffic control]], [[weather radar]], surface ship [[radar]], and some [[communications satellite]]s, especially those used by [[NASA]] to communicate with the [[Space Shuttle]] and the [[International Space Station]]. The 10&amp;nbsp;cm [[radar]] short-band ranges roughly from 1.55 to 5.2&amp;nbsp;GHz.  The S band also contains the 2.4–2.483 GHz [[ISM band]], widely used for low power unlicensed microwave devices such as [[cordless phone]]s, wireless headphones ([[Bluetooth]]), [[wireless networking]] (WiFi), [[garage door opener]]s, [[keyless entry|keyless vehicle locks]], [[baby monitor]]s as well as for medical [[diathermy]] machines and [[microwave oven]]s (typically at 2.495GHz).

==Satellite communications==
In the [[United States|U.S.]], the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] approved satellite-based [[Digital Audio Radio Service]] (DARS) [[Radio broadcasting|broadcasting]] in the S band from 2.31 to 2.36&amp;nbsp;GHz, currently used by [[Sirius XM Radio]]. More recently, it has approved for portions of the S band between 2.0 and 2.2&amp;nbsp;GHz the creation of Mobile Satellite Service (MSS) networks in connection with Ancillary Terrestrial Components (ATC). There are presently a number of companies attempting to deploy such networks, including [[ICO Satellite Management]] and [[TerreStar]].

The 2.6&amp;nbsp;GHz range is used for [[China Multimedia Mobile Broadcasting]], a [[satellite radio]] and [[mobile TV]] standard which, as with [[Property|proprietary]] systems in the U.S., is [[:wikt:incompatible|incompatible]] with the [[open standard]]s used in the rest of the world.

In May 2009, [[Inmarsat]] and [[Solaris Mobile]] (a joint venture between [[Eutelsat Communications|Eutelsat]] and [[SES S.A.|SES]], now [[EchoStar Mobile]]) were awarded each a 2×15&amp;nbsp;MHz portion of the S band by the [[European Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/09/770|title=European Commission - PRESS RELEASES  - Press release - European Commission paves the way for European mobile satellite services|author=|date=|website=europa.eu|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two companies are allowed two years to start providing pan-European MSS services for 18 years. Allocated frequencies are 1.98 to 2.01&amp;nbsp;GHz for Earth to space communications, and from 2.17 to 2.2&amp;nbsp;GHz for space to Earth communications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erodocdb.dk/docs/doc98/Official/Pdf/6262008EC.pdf|title=Decision No 626/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 June 2008 on the selection and authorisation of systems providing mobile satellite services (MSS)|author=|date=|website=erodocdb.dk|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Eutelsat [[W series (satellites)|W2A]] satellite launched in April, 2009 and located at 10° East is currently the unique satellite in Europe operating on S band frequencies.

In some countries, S band is used for [[Direct broadcast satellite|Direct-to-Home satellite]] television (unlike similar services in most countries, which use [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band]]). The frequency typically allocated for this service is 2.5 to 2.7&amp;nbsp;GHz (LOF 1.570&amp;nbsp;GHz).

[[IndoStar-1]] was the world's first commercial communications satellite to use S-band frequencies for broadcast (pioneered by van der Heyden), which efficiently penetrate the atmosphere and provide high-quality transmissions to small-diameter 80&amp;nbsp;cm antennas in regions that experience heavy rainfall such as Indonesia. Similar performance is not economically feasible with comparable Ku- or C-band DTH satellite systems since more power is required in these bands to penetrate the moist atmosphere.

==Other uses==
{{main|Citizens Broadband Radio Service}}
[[Wireless network]] equipment compatible with [[IEEE]] [[802.11b]] and [[802.11g]] standards use the 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz section of the S band. Some digital cordless telephones operate in this band too. [[Microwave oven]]s operate at 2495 or 2450&amp;nbsp;MHz.  [[IEEE 802.16]]a and 802.16e standards use a part of the frequency range of S band; under [[WiMAX]] standards most vendors are now manufacturing equipment in the range of 3.5&amp;nbsp;GHz. The exact frequency range allocated for this type of use varies between countries.

In [[North America]], {{nowrap|2.4&amp;ndash;2.483 GHz}} is an [[ISM band]] used for [[unlicensed spectrum]] devices such as [[cordless phone]]s, [[wireless headphone]]s, and [[video sender]]s, among other [[consumer electronics]] uses, including [[Bluetooth]] which operates between 2.402&amp;nbsp;GHz and 2.480&amp;nbsp;GHz.

[[Amateur radio]] and [[amateur satellite]] operators have two S-band allocations, [[13-centimeter band|13 cm]] (2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz) and [[9-centimeter band|9 cm]] (3.4&amp;nbsp;GHz). [[Amateur television]] repeaters also operate in these bands.

Airport surveillance radars typically operate in the 2700&amp;ndash;2900&amp;nbsp;MHz range.

Particle accelerators may be powered by S-band RF sources. The frequencies are then standardized at 2.998&amp;nbsp;GHz (Europe) or 2.856&amp;nbsp;GHz (US).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jlab.org/conferences/FLS2012/talks/Thur/isu_jlab39_fls2012_57_final.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

The National [[NEXRAD]] Radar network operates with S-band frequencies. Before implementation of this system, [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]] frequencies were commonly used for weather surveillance.

In the United States, the 3.55 to 3.7 GHz band is becoming shared spectrum under rules adopted by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] in April 2015 as a result of the [[National Broadband Plan (United States)]]. The biggest user of CBRS ([[Citizens Broadband Radio service]]) spectrum is the [[United States Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=CBRS Spectrum Could Open Windows of Opportunity for Cable Ops|last=Baumgartner|first=Jeff|work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|date=October 23, 2017|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.networkworld.com/article/3180615/mobile-wireless/faq-what-in-the-wireless-world-is-cbrs.html|title=FAQ: What in the wireless world is CBRS?|last=Brown|first=Bob|work=Network World|date=March 14, 2017|accessdate=January 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cable companies are planning to use the band for [[wireless broadband]] in rural areas, with [[Charter Communications]] beginning tests of the service in January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Charter Puts Wireless Broadband to the Test|last=Baumgartner|first=Jeff|work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|date=February 5, 2018|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Used as a transmit intermediate frequency in satellite communications as a replacement for L-band where a single/shared coaxial connection is used between the modem/IDU and antenna/ODU for both the transmit and receive signals. This is to prevent interference between the transmit and receive signals which would otherwise not occur on a dual coaxial setup where the transmit and receive signals are separate and both can use the whole L-band frequency range. In a single coaxial connection using S-Band to "frequency shift" the transmit signal away from L-band, a multiplier such as 10, is usually applied to form the SHF frequency. For example, the modem would transmit at 2.815GHz IF (S-Band) to the ODU and then the ODU up-converts this signal to 28.15GHz SHF (Ka-Band) towards the satellite.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1201">A '''sally saw''' is a portable, mechanical, motorized [[saw]]. It was made obsolete by the invention of the [[chainsaw]].

It was used for [[limbing]] (removing branches from the stem of a felled tree), and [[Log bucking|bucking]] (cutting a felled and delimbed tree into logs).

== Construction ==

A sally saw consists of several parts:
* An engine (internal combustion)
* A drive shaft that transmits power from the engine out to the cutting blade
* A cutting blade - a circular saw, sometimes hidden within a guard

== History ==

The sally saw was created by the [[Cummings Machine Works]] in the first half of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent| country = US| number= 2490255| status = patent| title = Portable Power Actuated Rim-Driven Annular Saw | fdate = 1945-10-05 | pridate = 1949-12-06| invent1 = Henry A.

The [[Setback (architecture)|setbacks]] at various heights are a typical skyscraper feature.]]

A '''skyscraper''' is a continuously habitable [[high-rise building]] that has over 40 floors&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; and is taller than approximately {{convert|150|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="VisualDictionary"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ambrose|first1=Gavin|last2=Harris|first2=Paul|last3=Stone|first3=Sally|title=The Visual Dictionary of Architecture|date=2008|publisher=AVA Publishing SA|location=Switzerland|isbn=978-2-940373-54-3|pages=233}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the term first referred to buildings with 10 to 20 floors in the 1880s. The definition shifted with advancing construction technology during the 20th Century.&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite web|last1=The Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica|title=Skyscraper|url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/skyscraper|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skyscrapers may host commercial offices or residential space, or both. For buildings above a height of {{convert|300|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, the term "supertall" can be used, while skyscrapers reaching beyond {{convert|600|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} are classified as "megatall".&lt;ref name="CTBUH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctbuh.org/TallBuildings/HeightStatistics/BuildingsinNumbers/TheTallest20in2020/tabid/2926/language/en-US/Default.aspx |title=The Tallest 20 in 2020: Entering the Era of the Megatall |date=8 December 2011 |publisher=[[CTBUH]] |accessdate=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One common feature of skyscrapers is having a steel framework that supports [[curtain wall (architecture)|curtain walls]]. These curtain walls either bear on the framework below or are suspended from the framework above, rather than resting on [[load-bearing wall]]s of conventional construction. Some early skyscrapers have a [[steel frame]] that enables the construction of load-bearing walls taller than of those made of [[reinforced concrete]].

Modern skyscrapers' walls are not load-bearing, and most skyscrapers are characterized by large surface areas of windows made possible by steel frames and curtain walls. However, skyscrapers can have curtain walls that mimic conventional walls with a small surface area of windows. Modern skyscrapers often have a [[Tube (structure)|tubular structure]], and are designed to act like a hollow [[cylinder]] to resist wind, seismic, and other lateral loads. To appear more slender, allow less wind exposure, and transmit more daylight to the ground, many skyscrapers have a design with [[Setback (architecture)|setbacks]], which are sometimes also structurally required.

==Definition==
[[File:Home Insurance Building.JPG|thumb|upright|The [[Home Insurance Building]] in [[Chicago]], completed in 1885, was the first steel-frame skyscraper; it was demolished in 1931.]] 
The term "skyscraper" was first applied to buildings of steel framed construction of at least 10 [[storey|stories]] in the late 19th century, a result of public amazement at the tall buildings being built in major American cities like [[Chicago]], [[New York City]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Detroit]], and [[St. Louis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://magicalhystorytour.blogspot.com/2010/08/skyscrapers.html For more on the origins of the term skyscraper, see "Skyscrapers," ''Magical Hystory Tour: The Origins of the Commonplace &amp; Curious in America'' (1 September 2010)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629192827/http://magicalhystorytour.blogspot.com/2010/08/skyscrapers.html |date=29 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first steel-frame skyscraper was the [[Home Insurance Building]] (originally 10 stories with a height of {{convert|42|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}) in Chicago, Illinois in 1885. Some point to Philadelphia's 10-story [[William L. Johnston|Jayne Building]] (1849–50) as a proto-skyscraper, or to New York's seven-floor [[Equitable Life Building (New York City)]], built in 1870, for its innovative use of a kind of skeletal frame, but such designation depends largely on what factors are chosen. Even the scholars making the argument find it to be purely academic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Charles E. Peterson]] |date=October 1950 |title=Ante-Bellum Skyscraper |journal=Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians |volume=9:3 |pages=25–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1200/is_v129/ai_4501450/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120708020221/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1200/is_v129/ai_4501450/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 July 2012 |title=The first skyscraper – new theory that Home Insurance Building was not the first |date=5 April 1986 |author=Ivars Peterson |publisher=CBS Interactive |quote="In my view, we can no longer argue that the Home Insurance Building was the first skyscraper," says Carl W. Condit, now retired from Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., and author of several books on Chicago architecture. "The claim rests on an unacceptably narrow idea of what constitutes a high-rise commercial building," he says."If there is a building in which all these technical factors—structural system, elevator, utilities—converge at the requisite level of maturity," argues Condit, "it's the Equitable Life Assurance Building in New York." Completed in 1870, the building rose 7½ stories, twice the height of its neighbors. |accessdate=6 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The structural definition of the word ''skyscraper'' was refined later by architectural historians, based on engineering developments of the 1880s that had enabled construction of tall multi-story buildings. This definition was based on the steel skeleton—as opposed to constructions of load-bearing [[masonry]], which passed their practical limit in 1891 with Chicago's [[Monadnock Building]].

:::—&amp;nbsp;[[Louis Sullivan]]'s ''The Tall Office Building Artistically Considered'' (1896)

The [[Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat]] defines skyscrapers as those buildings which reach or exceed {{convert|150|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height.&lt;ref&gt;[https://theurbandeveloper.com/articles/which-world-city-has-the-most-skyscrapers "Which World City Has The Most Skyscrapers?"]. ''The Urban Developer''. 11 March 2016. Retrieved 26 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Others in the United States and Europe also draw the lower limit of a skyscraper at {{convert|150|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skyscrapernews.com/news.php?ref=1244 |title=Huge New Rogers Skyscraper Proposed |quote=...their eleventh proper skyscraper, that is by definition buildings above 150&amp;nbsp;meters |publisher=skyscrapernews.com |date=3 December 2007 |accessdate=3 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VisualDictionary"/&gt; 

The [[Emporis Standards Committee]] defines a [[Tower block|high-rise]] building as "a multi-story structure between 35–100 meters tall, or a building of unknown height from 12–39 floors"&lt;ref&gt;[http://standards.emporis.com/?nav=realestate&amp;lng=3&amp;esn=18727 Data Standards: high-rise building (ESN 18727)], [[Emporis Standards]], accessed on line 16 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and a skyscraper as "a multi-story building whose architectural height is at least {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}."&lt;ref&gt;[http://standards.emporis.com/?nav=realestate&amp;lng=3&amp;esn=24419 Data Standards: skyscraper (ESN 24419)], [[Emporis Standards]], accessed on line 16 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[structural engineer]]s define a highrise as any vertical construction for which wind is a more significant [[Structural load|load factor]] than [[earthquake]] or weight. Note that this criterion fits not only high-rises but some other tall structures, such as [[tower]]s. 

The word ''skyscraper'' often carries a connotation of pride and achievement. The skyscraper, in name and social function, is a modern expression of the age-old symbol of the [[axis mundi|world center]] or ''axis mundi'': a pillar that connects earth to heaven and the four compass directions to one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fondazione-delbianco.org/seminari/default.asp?tiporiga=A1&amp;idprog=14&amp;label= |title=Penza State University of Architecture and Construction; Before The Workshop (1) Tower |publisher=Fondazione-delbianco.org |date=31 August 1939 |accessdate=5 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tallest building in ancient times was the {{convert|146|m|ft|abbr =on}} [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] in [[ancient Egypt]], built in the 26th century BC. It was not surpassed in height for thousands of years, the {{convert|160|m|ft|abbr =on}} [[Lincoln Cathedral]] having exceeded it in 1311–1549, before its central spire collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=A.F.K. |url=http://gwydir.demon.co.uk/PG/BellsLincoln/BellsLincoln.htm |title=The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Cathedral Church of Lincoln, by A.F.

However, being uninhabited, none of these structures actually comply with the modern definition of a skyscraper.

High-rise apartments flourished in [[classical antiquity]]. [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] [[insulae]] in [[Roman Empire|imperial]] cities reached 10 and more stories.&lt;ref name="Gregory S. Aldrete"&gt;Gregory S. Aldrete: "Daily Life in the Roman City: Rome, Pompeii and Ostia", 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-313-33174-9}}, p.79f.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with [[Augustus]] (r. 30&amp;nbsp;BC-14&amp;nbsp;AD), several [[Roman emperor|emperors]] attempted to establish limits of 20–25&amp;nbsp;m for multi-story buildings, but met with only limited success.&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], 5.3.7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander G. McKay: Römische Häuser, Villen und Paläste, [[Feldmeilen]] 1984, {{ISBN|3-7611-0585-1}} p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; Lower floors were typically occupied by shops or wealthy families, the upper rented to the lower classes.&lt;ref name="Gregory S. Aldrete"/&gt; Surviving [[Oxyrhynchus Papyri]] indicate that seven-story buildings existed in [[Roman province|provincial]] towns such as in 3rd century AD [[Hermopolis]] in [[History of Roman Egypt|Roman Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 2719, in: Katja Lembke, Cäcilia Fluck, Günter Vittmann: ''Ägyptens späte Blüte. Die Römer am Nil'', Mainz 2004, {{ISBN|3-8053-3276-9}}, p.29&lt;/ref&gt;

The skylines of many important [[Middle Ages|medieval]] cities had large numbers of high-rise urban towers, built by the wealthy for defense and status. The residential [[Towers of Bologna|Towers]] of 12th century [[Bologna]] numbered between 80 and 100 at a time, the tallest of which is the {{convert|97.2|m|ft|abbr =on}} high Asinelli Tower. A [[Florence|Florentine]] law of 1251 decreed that all urban buildings be immediately reduced to less than 26&amp;nbsp;m.&lt;ref name="Werner Müller 345"&gt;Werner Müller: "dtv-Atlas Baukunst I. Allgemeiner Teil: Baugeschichte von Mesopotamien bis Byzanz", 14th ed., 2005, {{ISBN|978-3-423-03020-5}}, p.345&lt;/ref&gt; Even medium-sized towns of the era are known to have proliferations of towers, such as the 72 up to 51&amp;nbsp;m height in [[San Gimignano]].&lt;ref name="Werner Müller 345"/&gt;

The [[History of Arab Egypt|medieval Egyptian]] city of [[Fustat]] housed many high-rise residential buildings, which [[Al-Muqaddasi]] in the 10th century described as resembling [[minaret]]s. [[Nasir Khusraw]] in the early 11th century described some of them rising up to 14 stories, with [[roof garden]]s on the top floor complete with ox-drawn [[water wheel]]s for irrigating them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Islamic Architecture in Cairo|first=Doris|last=Behrens-Abouseif|year=1992|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|isbn=978-90-04-09626-4|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cairo]] in the 16th century had high-rise [[apartment building]]s where the two lower floors were for commercial and storage purposes and the multiple stories above them were [[Renting|rented]] out to [[Leasehold estate|tenants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Traditional Islamic principles of built environment|first=Hisham|last=Mortada|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2003|isbn=978-0-7007-1700-2|page=viii}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early example of a city consisting entirely of high-rise housing is the 16th-century city of [[Shibam]] in [[Yemen]]. Shibam was made up of over 500 tower houses,&lt;ref name=UNESCO/&gt; each one rising 5 to 11 stories high,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Land without shade|first=Hans|last=Helfritz|journal=Journal of the Royal Central Asian Society|volume=24|issue=2|date=April 1937|pages=201–16|doi=10.1080/03068373708730789}}&lt;/ref&gt; with each floor being an [[apartment]] occupied by a single family. The city was built in this way in order to protect it from [[Bedouin]] attacks.&lt;ref name=UNESCO&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/192|title=Old Walled City of Shibam|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shibam still has the tallest [[mudbrick]] buildings in the world, with many of them over {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}} high.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Hadhramaut|first=J.

An early modern example of high-rise housing was in 17th-century [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, where a defensive city wall defined the boundaries of the city. Due to the restricted land area available for development, the houses increased in height instead. Buildings of 11 stories were common, and there are records of buildings as high as 14 stories. Many of the stone-built structures can still be seen today in the old town of Edinburgh. The oldest iron framed building in the world, although only partially iron framed, is [[Ditherington Flax Mill|The Flaxmill]] (also locally known as the "Maltings"), in [[Shrewsbury]], England. Built in 1797, it is seen as the "grandfather of skyscrapers", since its fireproof combination of cast iron columns and cast iron beams developed into the modern steel frame that made modern skyscrapers possible. In 2013 funding was confirmed to convert the derelict building into offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-shropshire-23495105 |title=Shrewsbury Flax Mill: Funding for offices and restoration |date=30 July 2013 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early skyscrapers===
{{main article|Early skyscrapers}}
In 1857 [[Elisha Otis]] introduced the safety elevator, allowing convenient and safe passenger movement to upper floors. Another crucial development was the use of a steel frame instead of stone or brick, otherwise the walls on the lower floors on a tall building would be too thick to be practical. An early development in this area was [[Oriel Chambers]] in [[Liverpool]], England. It was only five floors high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Oriel Chambers |publisher=Liverpool Architectural Society |url=http://www.liverpoolarchitecture.com/tours/buildings/building.php?id=25 |accessdate=14 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922062904/http://www.liverpoolarchitecture.com/tours/buildings/building.php?id=25 |archivedate=22 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_pQPhVWNTY Manchester School of Architecture video] YouTube&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bdonline.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=428&amp;storycode=3155796&amp;channel=783&amp;c=2 Building Design] Architect's website, 8 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Further developments led to the world's first skyscraper, the ten-story [[Home Insurance Building]] in Chicago, built in 1884–1885.&lt;ref name="Verbivore's Feast, p289"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Chrysti M. |title=Verbivore's Feast: Second Course: More Word &amp; Phrase Origins|publisher=Farcountry Press |year=2006 |page=289 |isbn=978-1-56037-402-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d3bov9J_1w0C&amp;pg=PA289|quote=The word ''skyscraper'', in its architectural context, was first applied to the Home Insurance Building, completed in Chicago in 1885.}}&lt;/ref&gt; While its height is not considered very impressive today, it was at that time. The building of tall buildings in the 1880s gave the skyscraper its first architectural movement the [[Chicago school (architecture)|Chicago School]], which developed what has been called the Commercial Style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/apr/02/worlds-first-skyscraper-chicago-home-insurance-building-history|title=The world's first skyscraper: a history of cities in 50 buildings, day 9|first=Colin|last=Marshall|date=2 April 2015|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The architect, Major [[William Le Baron Jenney]], created a load-bearing structural frame. In this building, a steel frame supported the entire weight of the walls, instead of load-bearing walls carrying the weight of the building. This development led to the "Chicago skeleton" form of construction. In addition to the steel frame, the Home Insurance Building also utilized fireproofing, elevators, and electrical wiring, key elements in most skyscrapers today.&lt;ref&gt;Dupré, Judith. ''Skyscrapers''. New York: Black Dog &amp; Leventhal, 1996. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Burnham and Root]]'s {{convert|45|m|abbr=on}} [[Rand McNally Building]] in Chicago, 1889, was the first all-steel framed skyscraper,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/300004.html |title=The Plan Comes Together |work=Encyclopedia of Chicago |accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Louis Sullivan]]'s {{convert|41|m|abbr=on}} [[Wainwright Building]] in St. Louis, Missouri, 1891, was the first [[steel-framed building]] with soaring vertical bands to emphasize the height of the building and is therefore considered to be the first early skyscraper.

Most early skyscrapers emerged in the land-strapped areas of Chicago and New York City toward the end of the 19th century. A land boom in Melbourne, Australia between 1888 and 1891 spurred the creation of a significant number of early skyscrapers, though none of these were steel reinforced and few remain today. Height limits and fire restrictions were later introduced. London builders soon found building heights limited due to a complaint from [[Queen Victoria]], rules that continued to exist with few exceptions.

Concerns about [[aesthetics]] and fire safety had likewise hampered the development of skyscrapers across continental Europe for the first half of the twentieth century. Some notable exceptions are the {{convert|43|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall 1898 [[Witte Huis]] ''(White House)'' in [[Rotterdam]]; the [[Royal Liver Building]] in Liverpool, completed in 1911 and {{convert|90|m|ft|abbr=on}} high;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Royal Liver Building |work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/511448/Royal-Liver-Building |accessdate=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the {{convert|57|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall 1924 [[Wilhelm Marx House|Marx House]] in [[Düsseldorf]], Germany; the {{convert|61|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[Kungstornen]] ''(Kings' Towers)'' in [[Stockholm]], Sweden, which were built 1924–25,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hultin |first=Olof |author2=Bengt O H Johansson |author3=Johan Mårtelius |author4=Rasmus Wærn |title=The Complete Guide to Architecture in Stockholm |publisher=Arkitektur Förlag |year=1998 |location=Stockholm |page=62 |isbn=978-91-86050-43-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; the {{convert|89|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[Edificio Telefónica]] in [[Madrid]], Spain, built in 1929; the {{convert|87.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[Boerentoren]] in Antwerp, Belgium, built in 1932; the {{convert|66|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[Prudential, Warsaw|Prudential Building]] in [[Warsaw]], Poland, built in 1934; and the {{convert|108|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[Terrazza Martini Tower|Torre Piacentini]] in [[Genoa]], Italy, built in 1940.

After an early competition between Chicago and New York City for the world's tallest building, New York took the lead by 1895 with the completion of the {{convert|103|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall [[American Surety Building]], leaving New York with the title of the world's tallest building for many years.

===Modern skyscrapers===
[[File:Flatiron_Building_3618433845_5745ebc1b9.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Flatiron Building]] was completed in 1902 in New York City.]]
[[File:Empire State Building from the Top of the Rock.jpg|thumb|upright|Completed in 1931, the [[Empire State Building]] in New York City was the tallest building in the world for nearly 40 years.]]
Modern skyscrapers are built with [[steel]] or [[reinforced concrete]] frameworks and [[curtain wall (architecture)|curtain wall]]s of [[glass]] or polished [[stone]]. They use mechanical equipment such as [[water pump]]s and [[elevator]]s.

From the 1930s onwards, skyscrapers began to appear around the world—such as in Latin America (such as [[São Paulo]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Buenos Aires]], [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], [[Lima]], [[Caracas]], [[Bogotá]], [[Panama City]], [[Mexico City]], [[Monterrey]]) and in Asia ([[Tokyo]], [[Shanghai]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Manila]], [[Jakarta]], [[Singapore]], [[Mumbai]], [[Seoul]], [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Taipei]], [[Bangkok]]).

Immediately after [[World War II]], the [[Soviet Union]] planned eight massive skyscrapers, seven of which were built by 1953, dubbed the "[[Seven Sisters (Moscow)|Seven Sisters of Moscow]]". The [[Main building of Moscow State University|Building of Moscow State University]] was the tallest building in Europe in 1953–1990. Other skyscrapers in the style of [[Stalinist architecture|Socialist Classicism]] were erected in East Germany ([[Frankfurter Tor]]), Poland ([[Palace of Culture and Science|PKiN]]), Ukraine ([[Hotel Ukrayina]]), Latvia ([[Latvian Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences]]) and other countries. The western countries of Europe also began to permit taller skyscrapers than before WW2, such as [[Madrid]] during the 1950s ([[Gran Vía (Madrid)|Gran Vía]]). Finally, skyscrapers also began to be constructed in cities of Africa, the Middle East and Oceania (mainly Australia) from the late 1950s on.

Skyscraper projects after [[World War II]] typically rejected the classical designs of the [[early skyscrapers]], instead embracing the uniform [[International Style (architecture)|international style]]; many older skyscrapers were redesigned to suit contemporary tastes or even demolished—such as New York's [[Singer Building]], once the world's tallest skyscraper.

[[Germany|German]] architect [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] became one of the world's most renowned architects in the second half of the 20th century. He conceived of the glass façade skyscraper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=2006|title=A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=880|isbn=978-0-19-860678-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, along with Norwegian [[Fred Severud]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Seven Structural Engineers: The Felix Candela Lectures |publisher=Museum of Modern Art |author=Nordenson, Guy |year=2008 |location=New York City |page=21 |isbn=978-0870707032}}&lt;/ref&gt; he designed the [[Seagram Building]] in 1958, a skyscraper that is often regarded as the pinnacle of the modernist high-rise architecture.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |title=Mies van der Rohe Dies at 83; Leader of Modern Architecture |url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0327.html |quote=Mies van der Rohe, one of the great figures of 20th-century architecture. |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=17 August 1969 |accessdate=21 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many buildings designed in the 70s lacked a particular style and recalled ornamentation from earlier buildings designed before the 50s.

==Design and construction==
{{Main article|Skyscraper design and construction}}
[[File:Skyscraper Los Angeles Downtown 2013.jpg|thumb|Modern skyscrapers in [[downtown Los Angeles]]]]

The design and construction of skyscrapers involves creating safe, habitable spaces in very tall buildings. The buildings must support their weight, resist wind and earthquakes, and protect occupants from fire. Yet they must also be conveniently accessible, even on the upper floors, and provide utilities and a comfortable climate for the occupants. The problems posed in skyscraper design are considered among the most complex encountered given the balances required between [[economics]], [[Civil Engineering|engineering]], and [[construction]] management.

One common feature of skyscrapers is a steel framework from which curtain walls are suspended, rather than load-bearing walls of conventional construction. Most skyscrapers have a steel frame that enables them to be built taller than typical load-bearing walls of reinforced concrete. Skyscrapers usually have a particularly small surface area of what are conventionally thought of as walls. Because the walls are not load-bearing most skyscrapers are characterized by surface areas of windows made possible by the concept of steel frame and curtain wall. However, skyscrapers can also have curtain walls that mimick conventional walls and have a small surface area of windows.

The concept of a skyscraper is a product of the [[Industrial society|industrialized age]], made possible by cheap [[fossil fuel]] derived energy and industrially refined raw materials such as [[steel]] and [[concrete]]. The construction of skyscrapers was enabled by [[steel frame]] construction that surpassed [[brick and mortar]] construction starting at the end of the 19th century and finally surpassing it in the 20th century together with [[reinforced concrete]] construction as the price of steel decreased and labour costs increased.

The steel frames become inefficient and uneconomic for supertall buildings as usable floor space is reduced for progressively larger supporting columns.&lt;ref name="lehigh.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lehigh.edu/~infrk/2011.08.article.html |title=Lehigh University: Fazlur Rahman Khan Distinguished Lecture Series |publisher=Lehigh.edu |accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since about 1960, tubular designs have been used for high rises. This reduces the usage of material (more efficient in economic terms – [[Willis Tower]] uses a third less steel than the Empire State Building) yet allows greater height. It allows fewer interior columns, and so creates more usable floor space. It further enables buildings to take on various shapes.

[[Elevator]]s are characteristic to skyscrapers. In 1852 Elisha Otis introduced the safety elevator, allowing convenient and safe passenger movement to upper floors. Another crucial development was the use of a steel frame instead of stone or brick, otherwise the walls on the lower floors on a tall building would be too thick to be practical. Today major manufacturers of elevators include [[Otis Elevator Company|Otis]], [[ThyssenKrupp AG|ThyssenKrupp]], [[Schindler Group|Schindler]], and [[KONE]].

Advances in construction techniques have allowed skyscrapers to narrow in width, while increasing in height. Some of these new techniques include mass dampers to reduce vibrations and swaying, and gaps to allow air to pass through, reducing wind shear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Why Can't We Build Skinny Skyscrapers Everywhere?|url=http://www.citylab.com/design/2014/06/why-cant-we-build-skinny-skyscrapers-everywhere/373493/|website=CityLab|accessdate=2015-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basic design considerations===
Good structural design is important in most building design, but particularly for skyscrapers since even a small chance of catastrophic failure is unacceptable given the high price. This presents a paradox to civil engineers: the only way to assure a lack of failure is to test for all modes of failure, in both the laboratory and the real world. But the only way to know of all modes of failure is to learn from previous failures. Thus, no engineer can be absolutely sure that a given structure will resist all loadings that could cause failure, but can only have large enough margins of safety such that a failure is acceptably unlikely. When buildings do fail, engineers question whether the failure was due to some lack of foresight or due to some unknowable factor.

===Loading and vibration===
The load a skyscraper experiences is largely from the force of the building material itself. In most building designs, the weight of the structure is much larger than the weight of the material that it will support beyond its own weight. In technical terms, the [[dead load]], the load of the structure, is larger than the [[live load]], the weight of things in the structure (people, furniture, vehicles, etc.). As such, the amount of structural material required within the lower levels of a skyscraper will be much larger than the material required within higher levels. This is not always visually apparent. The [[Empire State Building]]'s [[Setback (architecture)|setbacks]] are actually a result of the building code at the time ([[1916 Zoning Resolution]]), and were not structurally required. On the other hand, [[John Hancock Center]]'s shape is uniquely the result of how it supports loads. Vertical supports can come in several types, among which the most common for skyscrapers can be categorized as steel frames, concrete cores, tube within tube design, and shear walls.

The wind loading on a skyscraper is also considerable. In fact, the lateral wind load imposed on super-tall structures is generally the governing factor in the structural design. Wind pressure increases with height, so for very tall buildings, the loads associated with wind are larger than dead or live loads.

Other vertical and horizontal loading factors come from varied, unpredictable sources, such as earthquakes.

===Steel frame===
By 1895, [[steel]] had replaced [[cast iron]] as skyscrapers' structural material. Its malleability allowed it to be formed into a variety of shapes, and it could be riveted, ensuring strong connections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Built Like Bridges: Iron, Steel, and Rivets in the Nineteenth-century Skyscraper |first=Thomas |last=Leslie |journal=Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians|volume=69 |issue=2 |date=June 2010|pages=234–261 |jstor=10.1525/jsah.2010.69.2.234|doi=10.1525/jsah.2010.69.2.234 }} Abstract only.&lt;/ref&gt; The simplicity of a steel frame eliminated the inefficient part of a shear wall, the central portion, and consolidated support members in a much stronger fashion by allowing both horizontal and vertical supports throughout. Among steel's drawbacks is that as more material must be supported as height increases, the distance between supporting members must decrease, which in turn increases the amount of material that must be supported. This becomes inefficient and uneconomic for buildings above 40 stories tall as usable floor spaces are reduced for supporting column and due to more usage of steel.&lt;ref name="lehigh.edu"/&gt;

===Tube structural systems===
{{see also|Tube (structure)}}
[[File:KM 5939 sears tower august 2007 B.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Willis Tower]] in Chicago showing the bundled tube frame design]]
A new structural system of framed tubes was developed in 1963. Fazlur Khan and J. Rankine defined the framed tube structure as "a three dimensional space structure composed of three, four, or possibly more frames, braced frames, or shear walls, joined at or near their edges to form a vertical tube-like structural system capable of resisting lateral forces in any direction by cantilevering from the foundation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Evolution of Concrete Skyscrapers |accessdate=14 May 2007 |url=http://www.civenv.unimelb.edu.au/ejse/Archives/Fulltext/200101/01/20010101.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070605133019/http://www.civenv.unimelb.edu.au/ejse/Archives/Fulltext/200101/01/20010101.htm |archivedate=5 June 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Closely spaced interconnected exterior columns form the tube. Horizontal loads (primarily wind) are supported by the structure as a whole. Framed tubes allow fewer interior columns, and so create more usable floor space, and about half the exterior surface is available for windows. Where larger openings like garage doors are required, the tube frame must be interrupted, with transfer girders used to maintain structural integrity. Tube structures cut down costs, at the same time allowing buildings to reach greater heights. Concrete tube-frame construction&lt;ref name=Ali/&gt; was first used in the [[DeWitt-Chestnut Apartment Building]], completed in [[Chicago]] in 1963,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alfred Swenson &amp; Pao-Chi Chang|title=building construction|work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |year=2008|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/83859/building-construction|accessdate=9 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and soon after in the [[John Hancock Center]] and [[construction of the World Trade Center|World Trade Center]].

The [[tube (structure)|tubular systems]] are fundamental to tall building design. Most buildings over 40-stories constructed since the 1960s now use a tube design derived from Khan's structural engineering principles,&lt;ref name="lehigh.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="constructionweekonline.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constructionweekonline.com/article-9180-top-10-worlds-tallest-steel-buildings/1/print/ |title=Top 10 world's tallest steel buildings |publisher=Constructionweekonline.com |accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; examples including the [[construction of the World Trade Center]], [[Aon Center (Chicago)|Aon Center]], [[Petronas Towers]], [[Jin Mao Building]], and most other supertall skyscrapers since the 1960s.&lt;ref name=Ali/&gt; The strong influence of tube structure design is also evident in the construction of the current tallest skyscraper, the [[Burj Khalifa]].&lt;ref name=Bayley&gt;{{cite news|title=Burj Dubai: The new pinnacle of vanity|author=Stephen Bayley|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=5 January 2010|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/dubai/6934603/Burj-Dubai-The-new-pinnacle-of-vanity.html|accessdate=26 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Trussed tube and X-bracing====
[[File:Skyscraper structure.png|thumb|left|Changes of structure with height; the [[Tube (structure)|tubular systems]] are fundamental for super tall buildings.]]
Khan pioneered several other variations of the tube structure design.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} One of these was the concept of [[X-bracing]], or the "[[Tube (structure)#Trussed tube|trussed tube]]", first employed for the [[John Hancock Center]]. This concept reduced the lateral load on the building by transferring the load into the exterior columns. This allows for a reduced need for interior columns thus creating more floor space. This concept can be seen in the John Hancock Center, designed in 1965 and completed in 1969. One of the most famous buildings of the [[Structural Expressionism|structural expressionist]] style, the skyscraper's distinctive X-bracing exterior is actually a hint that the structure's skin is indeed part of its 'tubular system'. This idea is one of the architectural techniques the building used to climb to record heights (the tubular system is essentially the spine that helps the building stand upright during wind and [[seismic loading|earthquake loads]]). This X-bracing allows for both higher performance from tall structures and the ability to open up the inside floorplan (and usable floor space) if the architect desires.

The John Hancock Center was far more efficient than earlier [[Steel frame|steel-frame]] structures. Where the [[Empire State Building]] (1931), required about 206 kilograms of steel per square metre and [[Chase Manhattan Bank Building]] (1961) required 275, the John Hancock Center required only 145.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; The trussed tube concept was applied to many later skyscrapers, including the [[Onterie Center]], [[Citigroup Center]] and [[Bank of China Tower, Hong Kong|Bank of China Tower]].&lt;ref name="Introduction to Tall Building architectures"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teaching.ust.hk/~civl101/Civl101%20-%20Introduction%20to%20Tall%20Building%20Structures.pdf |format=PDF |page=34 |title=Introduction to Tall building Structures |author=Dr. D.

====Bundled tube====
An important variation on the tube frame is the "[[Tube (structure)#Bundled tube|bundled tube]]", which uses several interconnected tube frames. The [[Willis Tower]] in Chicago used this design, employing nine tubes of varying height to achieve its distinct appearance. The bundled tube structure meant that "buildings no longer need be boxlike in appearance: they could become sculpture."&lt;ref name=Bayley/&gt;

===The elevator conundrum===
The invention of the [[elevator]] was a precondition for the invention of skyscrapers, given that most people would not (or could not) climb more than a few flights of stairs at a time. The elevators in a skyscraper are not simply a necessary utility, like running water and electricity, but are in fact closely related to the design of the whole structure: a taller building requires more elevators to service the additional floors, but the elevator shafts consume valuable floor space. If the service core, which contains the elevator shafts, becomes too big, it can reduce the profitability of the building. Architects must therefore balance the value gained by adding height against the value lost to the expanding service core.&lt;ref name="HSW3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/skyscraper3.htm|title=How Skyscrapers Work: Making it Functional|publisher=HowStuffWorks|accessdate=30 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many tall buildings use elevators in a non-standard configuration to reduce their footprint. Buildings such as the former [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center Towers]] and Chicago's [[John Hancock Center]] use [[sky lobby|sky lobbies]], where express elevators take passengers to upper floors which serve as the base for local elevators. This allows architects and engineers to place elevator shafts on top of each other, saving space. Sky lobbies and express elevators take up a significant amount of space, however, and add to the amount of time spent commuting between floors.

Other buildings, such as the [[Petronas Towers]], use [[double-deck elevator]]s, allowing more people to fit in a single elevator, and reaching two floors at every stop. It is possible to use even more than two levels on an elevator, although this has never been done. The main problem with double-deck elevators is that they cause everyone in the elevator to stop when only people on one level need to get off at a given floor.

Buildings with sky lobbies include the [[World Trade Center (2001–present)|World Trade Center]], [[Petronas Twin Towers]] and [[Taipei 101]]. The 44th-floor sky lobby of the John Hancock Center also featured the first [[high-rise]] indoor [[swimming pool]], which remains the highest in America.&lt;ref name=Emporis&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=116876|title=John Hancock Center|author=Emporis GmbH|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic rationale==
Skyscrapers are usually situated in [[city center]]s where the price of land is high. Constructing a skyscraper becomes justified if the price of land is so high that it makes [[economics|economic]] sense to build upwards as to minimize the cost of the land per the total floor area of a building. Thus the construction of skyscrapers is dictated by economics and results in skyscrapers in a certain part of a large city unless a [[building code]] restricts the height of buildings.

Skyscrapers are rarely seen in small cities and they are characteristic of large cities, because of the critical importance of high land prices for the construction of skyscrapers. Usually only office, commercial and hotel users can afford the rents in the city center and thus most tenants of skyscrapers are of these classes. Some skyscrapers have been built in areas where the [[bedrock]] is near surface, because this makes constructing the [[foundation (engineering)|foundation]] cheaper, for example this is the case in [[Midtown Manhattan]] and [[Lower Manhattan]], in [[New York City]], but not in-between these two parts of the city.

Today, skyscrapers are an increasingly common sight where land is expensive, as in the centers of big cities, because they provide such a high ratio of rentable floor space per unit area of land.

&lt;math&gt;\text{Simple price of floor area (currency/}\mathrm{m}^2\text{)} = \frac{\text{price of land area (currency)}} {\text{total floor area (}\mathrm{m}^2\text{)}}&lt;/math&gt;

One problem with skyscrapers is [[Parking lot|car parking]]. In the largest cities most people commute via public transport, but for smaller cities a lot of parking spaces are needed. [[Multi-storey car park]]s are impractical to build very tall, so a lot of land area is needed.

There may be a correlation between skyscraper construction and great [[income inequality]] but this has not been conclusively proven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.governing.com/columns/eco-engines/gov-skyscrapers-link-with-inequality.html|title=Does Inequality Promote Skyscrapers?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental impact==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2017}}
[[File:30 St Mary Axe - The Gherkin from Leadenhall St - Nov 2006.jpg|thumb|upright|[[30 St Mary Axe]] in London is an example of a modern environmentally friendly skyscraper.]]
The amount of steel, concrete, and glass needed to construct a single skyscraper is large, and these materials represent a great deal of [[embodied energy]]. Skyscrapers are thus energy intensive buildings, but skyscrapers have a long lifespan, for example the [[Empire State Building]] in [[New York City]], [[United States]] completed in 1931 and is still in active use.

Skyscrapers have considerable mass, which means that they must be built on a sturdier foundation than would be required for shorter, lighter buildings. Building materials must also be lifted to the top of a skyscraper during construction, requiring more energy than would be necessary at lower heights. Furthermore, a skyscraper consumes a lot of electricity because [[potable]] and non-potable water has to be pumped to the highest occupied floors, skyscrapers are usually designed to be [[HVAC|mechanically ventilated]], elevators are generally used instead of stairs, and natural lighting cannot be utilized in rooms far from the windows and the windowless spaces such as elevators, bathrooms and stairwells.

Skyscrapers can be artificially lit and the energy requirements can be covered by [[renewable energy]] or other electricity generation with low [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. Heating and cooling of skyscrapers can be efficient, because of centralized [[HVAC]] systems, heat radiation blocking [[window]]s and small surface area of the building. There is [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) certification for skyscrapers. For example, the Empire State Building received a gold Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design rating in September 2011 and the Empire State Building is the tallest LEED certified building in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://inhabitat.com/nyc/empire-state-building-achieves-leed-gold-certification/ |first=Jessica |last=Dailey |title=Empire State Building Achieves LEED Gold Certification |work=Inhabitat.com |date=14 September 2011 |accessdate=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; proving that skyscrapers can be environmentally friendly. Also the [[30 St Mary Axe]] in [[London]], the [[United Kingdom]] is an environmentally friendly skyscraper.

In the lower levels of a skyscraper a larger percentage of the building cross section must be devoted to the building structure and services than is required for lower buildings:
* More structure – because it must be stronger to support more floors above
* [[Skyscraper design and construction#The elevator conundrum|The elevator conundrum]] creates the need for more lift shafts—everyone comes in at the bottom and they all have to pass through the lower part of the building to get to the upper levels.
* [[Building services]] – power and water enter the building from below and have to pass through the lower levels to get to the upper levels.

In low-rise structures, the support rooms ([[chiller]]s, [[transformer]]s, [[boiler]]s, [[pump]]s and [[air handling unit]]s) can be put in basements or roof space—areas which have low rental value. There is, however, a limit to how far this plant can be located from the area it serves. The farther away it is the larger the risers for ducts and pipes from this plant to the floors they serve and the more floor area these risers take. In practice this means that in highrise buildings this plant is located on 'plant levels' at intervals up the building.

==History of the tallest skyscrapers==
{{Main article|History of the tallest buildings in the world|List of tallest buildings|List of tallest buildings and structures}}
At the beginning of the 20th century, [[New York City]] was a center for the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts architectural]] movement, attracting the talents of such great architects as [[Stanford White]] and [[Carrere and Hastings]]. As better construction and engineering technology became available as the century progressed, New York City and [[Chicago]] became the focal point of the competition for the tallest building in the world. Each city's striking skyline has been composed of numerous and varied skyscrapers, many of which are icons of 20th-century architecture:
* The [[Flatiron Building]], designed by [[Daniel Hudson Burnham]] and standing 285&amp;nbsp;ft (87&amp;nbsp;m) high, was one of the tallest buildings in New York City upon its completion in 1902, made possible by its steel skeleton. It was one of the first buildings designed with a steel framework, and to achieve this height with other construction methods of that time would have been very difficult. (The [[Tower Building (New York City)|Tower Building]], designed by [[Bradford Gilbert]] and built in 1889, is considered by some to be New York City's first skyscraper, and may have been the first building in New York City to use a skeletal steel frame,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Robb Ellis|title=The Epic of New York City|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ODnnmcciMLgC&amp;pg=PA405|year=2005|publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf publishers|isbn=978-0-7867-1436-0|pages=405–415}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Home Insurance Building]] in Chicago, which was built in 1884, is considered the world's first skyscraper due to its steel skeleton).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/home-insurance-building|title=Home Insurance Building|work=HISTORY.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent buildings such as the [[Singer Building]] and the [[Metropolitan Life Tower]] were higher still.
* The [[Woolworth Building]], a neo-Gothic "Cathedral of Commerce" overlooking City Hall, was designed by [[Cass Gilbert]]. At 792&amp;nbsp;feet (241&amp;nbsp;m), it became the world's tallest building upon its completion in 1913, an honor it retained until 1930, when it was overtaken by [[40 Wall Street]].
* Later in 1930 the [[Chrysler Building]] took the lead as the tallest building in the world, scraping the sky at 1,046&amp;nbsp;feet (319&amp;nbsp;m).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=83 |title=Chrysler Building.

* The [[Empire State Building]], the first building to have more than 100 floors (it has 102), was completed the following year. It was designed by [[Shreve, Lamb and Harmon]] in the contemporary Art Deco style. The tower takes its name from the [[List of U.S. state nicknames|nickname]] of [[New York State]]. Upon its completion in 1931 at 1,250&amp;nbsp;feet (381&amp;nbsp;m), it took the top spot as tallest building, and towered above all other buildings until 1972. The antenna mast added in 1951 brought pinnacle height to 1,472&amp;nbsp;feet (449&amp;nbsp;m), lowered in 1984 to 1,454&amp;nbsp;feet (443&amp;nbsp;m).&lt;ref name="pollak"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D03EEDD153FF930A15757C0A9609C8B63&amp;scp=4&amp;sq=%22empire%20state%20building%22%20height%201,454&amp;st=cse|title=75 YEARS: F. Y. I.|last=Pollak |first=Michael|date=23 April 2006|work=The New York Times|accessdate=31 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] officially reached full height in 1972, was completed in 1973, and consisted of two tall towers and several smaller buildings. For a short time, the first of the two towers was the world's tallest building. Upon completion, the towers stood for 28&amp;nbsp;years, until the &lt;!--despite the dmy date ordering in this article, this event is better known worldwide as '911' or '11 September'--&gt;[[September 11 attacks]] destroyed the buildings in 2001. Various governmental entities, financial firms, and law firms called the towers home.
* The [[Willis Tower]] (formerly Sears Tower) was completed in 1974, one year after the World Trade Center, and surpassed it as the world's tallest building. It was the first building to employ the "[[Tube (structure)|bundled tube]]" structural system, designed by Fazlur Khan. The building was not surpassed in height until the [[Petronas Towers]] were constructed in 1998, but remained the tallest in some categories until [[Burj Khalifa]] surpassed it in all categories in 2010. It is currently the second tallest building in the United States, after [[One World Trade Center]], which was built to replace the destroyed towers.

Momentum in setting records passed from the United States to other nations with the opening of the [[Petronas Twin Towers]] in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in 1998. The record for the world's tallest building has remained in Asia since the opening of [[Taipei 101]] in Taipei, Taiwan, in 2004. A number of architectural records, including those of the world's tallest building and tallest free-standing structure, moved to the Middle East with the opening of the [[Burj Khalifa]] in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

This geographical transition is accompanied by a change in approach to skyscraper design. For much of the twentieth century large buildings took the form of simple geometrical shapes. This reflected the "international style" or [[Modern architecture|modernist]] philosophy shaped by [[Bauhaus]] architects early in the century. The last of these, the Willis Tower and World Trade Center towers in New York, erected in the 1970s, reflect the philosophy. Tastes shifted in the decade which followed, and new skyscrapers began to exhibit [[Postmodernism|postmodernist]] influences. This approach to design avails itself of historical elements, often adapted and re-interpreted, in creating technologically modern structures. The Petronas Twin Towers recall Asian [[pagoda]] architecture and Islamic geometric principles. Taipei 101 likewise reflects the [[pagoda]] tradition as it incorporates ancient [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]] such as the [[Ruyi (scepter)|ruyi]] symbol. The Burj Khalifa draws inspiration from traditional [[Islamic art]]. Architects in recent years have sought to create structures that would not appear equally at home if set in any part of the world, but that reflect the culture thriving in the spot where they stand.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==Cancellation==
Many skyscrapers were never built due to financial problems, politics and culture. The [[Chicago Spire]] was to be the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere, but it was on hold due to the global financial crisis of 2008. One year later, the project was cancelled.
* The {{convert|610|m|ft|adj=on}} [[Russia Tower]] was cancelled due to the global financial crisis of 2008. It would have dominated the [[Moscow]] skyline.
* Construction began in 1937 on the [[Palace of the Soviets]] in Moscow. It would have been the tallest building in the world at the time, but because of the German invasion in 1941 the unfinished steel frame was torn down for scrap to use in the war effort.
* Proposed in 1989, The [[Miglin-Beitler Skyneedle]] of Chicago would have been the tallest freestanding in the world. But it was never built due to the Persian gulf war. 
* The cancelled [[Chicago World Trade Center]] would have been the first skyscraper to exceed a height of {{convert|700|m|ft}}. It was proposed in the 1990s, a second one was to be completed but never built.
* The construction of the 200-floor, Dubai's [[Nakheel Tower]]—which was planned to be taller than {{convert|1000|m|ft}}—was halted due to financial problems; 18 months later the project was cancelled.
* Harry Grant's [[Grant USA Tower]] in Newark, New Jersey was never built due to bankruptcy, the tower would have more than 550 meters tall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=17115|title=Grant USA Tower, Newark - SkyscraperPage.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Project 2000 Tower]] in Chicago was cancelled and never built, it would have had a height of {{convert|610|m|ft}}
* The proposed [[1 New York Place]] would have had a height of {{convert|320|m|ft}}, but was never built.
* [[Vision Brisbane]] was to be the tallest building in [[Brisbane]] and third tallest in [[Australia]] if built. It was cancelled due to the 2008 global financial crisis and the site was eventually sold where construction of a skyscraper of similar height was approved.
* The original design of Hong Kong's [[International Commerce Centre]], with a height of {{convert|574|m|ft}}, was supposed to have a crystal facade. It was changed and decreased to {{convert|484|m|ft}} due to height restrictions.
* [[India Tower]] (previously known as the Park Hyatt Tower; also known as the Dynamix Balwas Tower or DB Tower) is a cancelled 126-storey, 718-metre (2,356 ft) supertall skyscraper that began construction in the city of Mumbai, India, in 2010. The tower was originally planned for completion in 2016, but construction work was put on hold in 2011 due to a dispute between the tower's developers and Mumbai's civic authorities

Proposals for such structures have been put forward, including the [[Mubarak al-Kabir Tower|Burj Mubarak Al Kabir]] in [[Kuwait]] and [[Azerbaijan Tower]] in [[Baku]]. Kilometer-plus structures present architectural challenges that may eventually place them in a new architectural category.&lt;ref name="Sadek"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/537095-reaching-for-the-stars|title=Reaching for the stars|last=Owainati|first=Sadek|date=3 November 2008 |publisher=ArabianBusiness.com |accessdate=15 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first building under construction and planned to be over one kilometre tall is the [[Jeddah Tower]].

===Wooden skyscrapers===
{{Main|List of tallest wooden buildings}}
Several wooden skyscraper designs have been designed and built. A 14-story housing project in [[Bergen|Bergen, Norway]] known as 'Treet' or 'The Tree' became the world's tallest wooden apartment block when it was completed in late 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-construction-environment/wooden-plyscrapers-challenge-concrete-and-steel-idUSKBN1611U5|title=Wooden 'plyscrapers' challenge concrete and steel|last=Editorial|first=Reuters|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-03-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tree's record was eclipsed by Brock Commons, an 18-story wooden [[dormitory]] at the [[University of British Columbia]] in [[Canada]], when it was completed in September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.architectmagazine.com/technology/the-university-of-british-columbias-brock-commons-takes-the-title-of-tallest-wood-tower_o|title=The University of British Columbia's Brock Commons Takes the Title of Tallest Wood Tower|date=2016-09-16|newspaper=Architect|access-date=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A 40-story residential building 'Trätoppen' has been proposed by architect Anders Berensson to be built in [[Stockholm|Stockholm, Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dezeen.com/2016/04/25/anders-berensson-architects-tratoppen-wooden-skyscraper-concept-stockholm-cross-laminated-timber/|title=Anders Berensson proposes wooden skyscraper for Stockholm|date=2016-04-25|website=Dezeen|access-date=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trätoppen would be the tallest building in Stockholm, though there are no immediate plans to begin construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.designingbuildings.co.uk/wiki/Tratoppen,_Stockholm|title=Tratoppen, Stockholm - Designing Buildings Wiki|website=www.designingbuildings.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tallest currently-planned wooden skyscraper is the 70-story W350 Project in Tokyo, to be built by the Japanese wood products company Sumitomo Forestry Co. to celebrate its 350th anniversary in 2041.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/feb/16/plyscraper-city-tokyo-tower-wood-w350|title=Plyscraper city: Tokyo to build 350m tower made of wood|last=Hunt|first=Elle|date=2018-02-16|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; An 80-story wooden skyscraper, the River Beech Tower, has been proposed by a team including architects [[Perkins + Will]] and the [[University of Cambridge]].

Wooden skyscrapers are estimated to be around a quarter of the weight of an equivalent [[Reinforced concrete|reinforced-concrete]] structure as well as reducing the building carbon footprint by 60–75%. Buildings have been designed using [[Cross laminated timber|cross-laminated timber]] (CLT) which gives a higher rigidity and strength to wooden structures.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21706492-case-wooden-skyscrapers-not-barking-top-tree|title=Building materials: Top of the tree|website=The Economist|access-date=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; CLT panels are prefabricated and can therefore speed up building time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattlemag.com/are-high-rise-wood-buildings-seattles-future|title=Are High-Rise Wood Buildings in Seattle's Future? |website=Seattle Business Magazine|access-date=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Small plates''' is a manner of [[dining]] that became popular in US food service after 2000. ''Small plates'' may either refer to small dishes resembling [[appetizers]] which are ordered [[à la carte]] and often shared (such as [[tapas]]), or to the small [[Course (dining)|courses]] served as part of a more formal meal.

Some types of small plates which have influenced the modern US concept are:

* [[Tapas]], a wide variety of [[appetizers]] in [[Spanish cuisine]]
* [[Mezze]], a wide variety of [[appetizers]] in [[Turkish cuisine]], and sometimes in [[Greek cuisine]]
* [[Antipasti]] and [[Cicchetti (food)|cicchetti]] in [[Italian cuisine]]
* [[Banchan]], in [[Korean cuisine]]
* The small and usually shared dishes served at an [[izakaya]], a [[Japanese cuisine|Japanese]] pub
* The [[pu pu platter]] of [[Cuisine of Hawaii|Hawaiian cuisine]]
* [[Zakuski]] in [[Russian cuisine]]

'''SmartMedia''' is a [[flash memory|flash]] [[memory card]] standard owned by [[Toshiba]], with capacities ranging from 2 MB to 128 MB. SmartMedia memory cards are no longer manufactured.

==History==
The SmartMedia format was launched in the summer of 1995{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} to compete with the [[Miniature Card|MiniCard]], [[CompactFlash]], and [[PC Card]] formats.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Although memory cards are nowadays associated with [[digital camera]]s, [[digital audio player]]s, [[Personal digital assistant|PDAs]], and similar devices, SmartMedia was pitched as a successor to the computer [[floppy disk]]. Indeed, the format was originally named Solid State Floppy Disk Card (SSFDC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=How to Do Everything with Your Digital Camera |first=Dave |last=Johnson |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-07-226163-9 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |chapter=Working with Digital Film |page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SSFDC forum, a consortium aiming to promote SSFDC as an industry standard, was founded in April 1996, consisting of 37 initial members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Forum Established to Promote New Super Small Memory Card |publisher=Toshiba Corporation |date=1996-04-25 |url=http://www.toshiba.co.jp/about/press/1996_04/pr2501.htm |access-date=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A SmartMedia card consists of a single [[NAND flash]] chip embedded in a thin plastic card,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Essential Guide to Computer Data Storage |first=Andrei |last=Khurshudov |page=236 |chapter=Nonvolatile Solid-State Memory |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-13-092739-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; although some higher capacity cards contain multiple, linked chips. It was one of the smallest and thinnest of the early memory cards, only 0.76mm thick, and managed to maintain a favorable cost ratio as compared to the others. SmartMedia cards lack a built-in controller chip, which kept the cost down. This feature later caused problems, since some older devices would require firmware updates to handle larger capacity cards. The lack of built-in controller also made it impossible for the card to perform automatic [[wear levelling]], a process which prevents premature wearout of a sector by mapping the writes to various other sectors in the card.

SmartMedia cards can be used in a standard 3.5" floppy drive by means of a [[FlashPath]] adapter. This is possibly the only way of obtaining flash memory functionality with very old hardware, and it remains one of SmartMedia's most distinctive features. This method was not without its own disadvantages, as it required special drivers offering only very basic file read/write capability (or read-only on Macintosh systems) and was limited to floppy disk transfer speeds. However, this was not so troublesome in the earlier days of the format when card sizes were limited (generally 8~16MB) and USB interfaces were both uncommon and low-speed, with digital cameras connecting via "high speed" serial links that themselves needed drivers and special transfer programs. The fifteen minutes taken to read a nearly-full 16MB card - directly to hard disk - via Flashpath using the slowest (128kbit/s) PC floppy controller was still simpler and slightly faster than the quickest reliable (115.2kbit/s) serial link, without the need for connection, synching and thumbnail previewing, and only beaten by expensive parallel-port based external card readers that could do the same job in two minutes or less (1000kbit/s-plus, comparable to USB 1.0) when connected to a compatible high-speed ECP or EPP port (and ~5 minutes using a basic PPT in failsafe mode).

[[File:Comparison of a 2GB MicroSD Card and an 8MB SmartMedia card.jpg|thumb|Comparison of a 2GB MicroSD Card and an 8MB 3.3V SmartMedia Card]]

Typically, SmartMedia cards were used as storage for portable devices, in a form that could easily be removed for access by a [[Personal computer|PC]]. For example, pictures taken with a [[digital camera]] would be stored as image files on a SmartMedia card. A user could copy the images to a computer with a SmartMedia reader. A reader was typically a small box connected via [[USB]] or some other serial connection. Modern computers, both [[laptops]] and desktops, will occasionally have SmartMedia slots built in. While availability of dedicated SmartMedia readers has dropped off, readers that read multiple card types (such as 4-in-1, 10-in-1) continue to include the format, but even these have decreased in quantity, with many dropping SmartMedia in favour of [[MicroSD]] and/or [[Memory Stick Micro]].

SmartMedia was popular in digital cameras, and reached its peak in about 2001 when it garnered nearly half of the digital camera market. It was backed especially by [[Fujifilm]] and [[Olympus Corporation|Olympus]],{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} though the format started to exhibit problems as camera resolutions increased. Cards larger than 128 MB were not available, and the compact digital cameras were reaching a size where even SmartMedia cards were too big to be convenient. Eventually [[Toshiba]] switched to smaller, higher-capacity [[Secure Digital card]]s, and SmartMedia ceased to have major support after [[Olympus Corporation|Olympus]] and [[Fujifilm]] both switched to [[xD-Picture Card|xD]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} It did not find as much support in [[Personal digital assistant|PDAs]], [[MP3 Player]]s, or [[Pager]]s as some other formats, especially in North America and Europe, though there was still significant use.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

SmartMedia cards larger than 128 [[megabyte|MB]] were never released, although there were rumors of a 256 MB card being planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dpreview.com/articles/4152697018/smartmedia256mb |title=256 MB SmartMedia next year |website=Digital Photography Review |date=2001-09-07 |accessdate=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technical specifications for the memory size were released, and the 256 MB cards were even advertised in some places.{{Where|fact|date=July 2011}}&lt;!--see Talk:SmartMedia#256MB_card_seen_in_shop_window_in_2001 if that helps--&gt; Some older devices cannot support cards larger than 16 or sometimes 32 [[megabyte|MB]] without a firmware update, if at all. 
[[File:Smart Media X-ray.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[radiograph]] of SmartMedia card.]]

SmartMedia cards came in two formats, 5&amp;nbsp;V and the more modern 3.3&amp;nbsp;V (sometimes marked 3&amp;nbsp;V), named for their main supply voltages. The packaging was nearly identical, except for the reversed placement of the notched corner. Many older SmartMedia devices only support 5V SmartMedia cards, whereas many newer devices only support 3.3V cards. In order to protect 3.3V cards from being damaged in 5V-only devices, the card reader should have some mechanical provision (such as detecting the type of notch) to disallow insertion of an unsupported type of card. Some low-cost, 5V-only card readers do not operate this way, and inserting a 3.3V card into such a 5V-only reader will result in permanent damage to the card. Dual-voltage card readers are highly recommended.

There is an oversized xD-to-SmartMedia adapter that allows xD cards to use a SmartMedia port, but it does not fit entirely inside a SmartMedia slot. There is a limit on the capacity of the xD card when used in such adapters (sometimes 128 MB or 256 MB), and the device is subject to the restrictions of the SmartMedia reader as well.

SmartMedia memory cards are no longer manufactured as of around 2006. There have been no new devices designed for SmartMedia for quite a long time now. Smartmedia cards are still frequently available on eBay mostly in used condition with new cards coming up from time to time.

=== Copy protection ===
Many SmartMedia cards include a little-known copy protection feature known as "ID". This is why many cards are marked with "ID" beside the capacity. This gave every card a unique identification number for use with copy protection systems. One of the few implementations of this primitive DRM system was by the Korean company [[Game Park]], which used it to protect commercial titles for the [[GP32]] handheld gaming system. Samsung's 1999 Yepp Hip-Hop MP3 player also used the feature in order to implement [[Secure Digital Music Initiative]] DRM.
[[File:SmartMedia slot.jpg|thumb|SmartMedia card slot]]

===Format errors and data loss===
SmartMedia cards frequently become corrupted and unusable when the cards are read / written in a card reading device. Affected SmartMedia cards will be unusable and the camera or device will be unable to format, read or write to the card. Data loss and a change in the capacity that the device displays are also signs of a low level format corruption or a corrupted CIS (Card Information System). The majority of these card format errors can be repaired and the data or photos can be recovered. A low level format with the proper software and equipment can return the SmartMedia memory card to its proper working order. With some research on the internet one can find several sources of information and companies that provide a SmartMedia card repair service. Considering the dwindling supply of SmartMedia memory format, these corrupted cards and the devices they support are needlessly being discarded. The majority of corrupted or unusable SmartMedia cards can be repaired.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}
A recent discovery is that Flashpath adaptors can sometimes corrupt cards when the battery goes low, which is easily repaired by using software such as Winhex or simply cloning a card of identical capacity to the failed card.
Normally the data on them is still recoverable so it is advised to clone it to an image first so bitwise errors can be corrected.

'''The Combustion Institute''' is an educational non-profit, international, scientific and [[engineering society]] whose purpose is to promote research in [[combustion]] science. The institute was established in 1954, and its headquarters are in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], United States. The current president of the combustion institute is James F. Driscoll.

== Foundation and mission ==
The support of this important field of study spanning many scientific and engineering disciplines is done through the discussion of research findings at regional, national and the biennial international symposia, and through the publication of the ''[[Proceedings of the Combustion Institute]]'' and the Institute’s journals, ''[[Combustion and Flame]]'' and the affiliated journals [[Progress in Energy and Combustion Science]], [[Combustion Science and Technology]] and [[Combustion Theory and Modelling]] .&lt;ref name="The Combustion Institute website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.combustioninstitute.org|title=The Combustion Institute website|accessdate=2012-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The institute serves as the parent organization for thirty three national sections organized in many countries (the US being divided into three sections) as of 2012:&lt;ref&gt;In Celebration of the Fiftieth Anniversary of The Combustion Institute, The Combustion Institute, July 2004 [http://www.combustioninstitute.org/documents/HistoryFinal.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==International symposium on combustion==
The international symposium on combustion is organised by the Combustion Institute biennially. The first symposium on combustion was held in 1928 in the [[United States]] and the first international symposium on combustion was held on 1948, even though the combustion institute itself was found on 1954.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.combustioninstitute.org/about-the-institute/history/{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty six symposiums has been held so far and the 37th symposium is to be held on 2018.

== Institute Awards ==
During each International Symposium, The Combustion Institute awards the following:&lt;ref name="The Combustion Institute website"/&gt;
*[[Bernard Lewis (scientist)|Bernard Lewis]] Gold Medal – established in 1958 and awarded for brilliant research in the field of combustion.
*[[Alfred Charles Glyn Egerton|Alfred C. Egerton]] Gold Medal – established in 1958 and awarded for distinguished, continuing and encouraging contributions to the field of combustion.
*Silver Combustion Medal – established in 1958 and awarded to an outstanding paper presented at the previous symposium.
*The [[Hoyt C. Hottel|Hottel]] Lecture.
*[[Zeldovich|Ya B. Zeldovich]] Gold Medal – established in 1990 and awarded for outstanding contribution to the theory of combustion or detonation.
*Bernard Lewis Fellowship – established in 1996 during the 26th International Symposium, this award is awarded to encourage high quality research in combustion by young scientists and engineers.
*Distinguished Paper Award – established in 1996 during the 31st International Symposium, this award is presented to the paper in each of the twelve colloquia of a  Symposium which is judged to be most distinguished in quality, achievement and significance.

A '''tiltrotator''' (known under a number of trade names) is an hydraulic attachment/tool used on most [[excavator]]s, and [[backhoe]]s between 1,5-40 tons in the Nordic countries ([[Sweden]], [[Finland]], and [[Norway]]).  A tiltrotator is mounted on the [[excavator]] such that the excavator bucket can be rotated through 360 degrees and one tilts +/- 45 degrees, in order to increase the flexibility and precision of the [[excavator]]. A tiltrotator can best be described as a [[wrist]] between the arm of the excavator and bucket, (or whatever other tool is fitted to the tiltrotator's quick coupler).  With its integral [[quick coupler]] and rotary swivel, the tiltrotator can also use extra [[hydraulic]] functions to power and manipulate other worktools below it such as a [[breaker (hydraulic)|breaker]], [[grapple (construction)|grapple]] or an [[auger (drill)|auger]],  which can be attached to the quickcoupler on the tiltrotator, for simplified attachment mounting, dramatically increasing the [[excavator]]'s [[utilization]] on the jobsite. control systems which allows the operator to operate the machine fully through the joysticks. Recognized control systems are SVAB, ICS by Rototilt, Engcon Microprop DC2 and Steelwrist XControl G2. The tiltrotator is nowadays controlled through machines two or four electro-proportionally controlled hydraulic lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.khl.com/features/attachments-flexible-and-efficient/120515.article|title=Attachments: Flexible and efficient|work=KHL|access-date=2018-08-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tiltrotator (also known as a Rotortilt) was introduced to the market in [[Sweden]] in the early 1980s by the Norgrens under the family owned and operated company named Noreco, and has become the standard in Scandinavia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rototilt.com/en-GB/about-us/history/|title=Our history|website=www.rototilt.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has recently gained popularity in other countries such as the [[Netherlands]], [[Germany]], [[UK]], [[Japan]], [[Canada]] and [[United States]].
There are three major manufacturers of the Tiltrotator concept today (although similar products are sold by various competitors); Rototilt Group AB, (founded in 1973 by Allan Jonsson) who purchased Noreco in 1992, hired the Norgren brothers, and registered the brandname Rototilt, Engcon, (founded in 1993 by also ex-Noreco employee, Stig Engstrom) who started manufacturing their own product using only "tiltrotator" to avoid [[trademark]] infringements, and Steelwrist, (founded in 2005 by a team of industrialists), who started manufacturing after acquiring a new design originating from a tiltrotator called Dento which was released in 1989.

Other companies manufacturing their version of tiltrotator on a smaller scale include SMP, HKS, Kinshofer, Marttiini Metals, Catsu and Giant China under various product names as tiltrotator, swingrotator, swingotilt, mRoto, Nox, Rotiltor etc., although it's still commonplace on the market as a [[genericized trademark]] to call all versions a Tiltrotator.

[[File:AMPEX 2 ZOLL.jpg|thumb|Not all [[video tape recorder]]s use a cassette to contain the [[videotape]].  Early models of consumer video tape recorders ([[VTR]]s), and most professional broadcast analog videotape machines (e.g. [[Type C videotape|1-inch Type C]]) use reel to reel tape spools.]]

A '''videocassette recorder''', '''VCR''', or '''video recorder''' is an [[electromechanical]] device that records [[analog audio]] and [[analog video]] from [[broadcast television]] or other source on a removable, [[magnetic tape]] [[Videocassette#Cassette formats|videocassette]], and can play back the recording. Use of a VCR to record a  [[television program]] to play back at a more convenient time is commonly referred to as ''[[timeshifting]]''. VCRs can also play back prerecorded tapes. In the 1980s and 1990s, prerecorded videotapes were widely available for purchase and rental, and blank tapes were sold to make recordings. 

Most domestic VCRs are equipped with a television broadcast receiver ([[Tv tuner#Television|tuner]]) for TV reception, and a programmable clock ([[timer]]) for unattended recording of a [[television channel]] from a start time to an end time specified by the user. These features began as simple mechanical counter-based single-event timers, but were later replaced by more flexible multiple-event digital clock timers. In later models the multiple timer events could be programmed through a menu interface displayed on the playback TV screen ("[[on-screen display]]" or OSD). This feature allowed several programs to be recorded at different times without further user intervention, and became a major selling point.

== History ==
[[File:Nordemende spectra V100.jpg|thumb|right|Top-loading cassette mechanisms (such as the one on this VHS model) were common on early domestic VCRs.]]

=== Early machines and formats ===
The history of the videocassette recorder follows the history of videotape recording in general. In 1953, Dr. Norikazu Sawazaki developed a prototype [[helical scan]] [[video tape recorder]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PL0eAQAAMAAJ ''SMPTE Journal: Publication of the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers'', Volume 96, Issues 1-6; Volume 96], page 256, [[Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ampex]] introduced the [[Quadruplex videotape]] professional broadcast standard format with its Ampex VRX-1000 in 1956. It became the world's first commercially successful videotape recorder using two-inch (5.1&amp;nbsp;cm)  wide tape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cedmagic.com/history/ampex-commercial-vtr-1956.html |title=Ampex VRX-1000&amp;nbsp;– The First Commercial Videotape Recorder in 1956 |publisher=Cedmagic.com |date=14 April 1956 |access-date=31 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its high price of {{US$|50,000}}, the Ampex VRX-1000 could be afforded only by the television networks and the largest individual stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Richard N. Diehl |url=http://www.labguysworld.com/VTR_BirthOf.htm |title=Labguy'S World: The Birth Of Video Recording |publisher=Labguysworld.com |date= |access-date=31 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=50 Years of the Video Cassette Recorder|url=http://www.wipo.int/wipo_magazine/en/2006/06/article_0003.html|journal=www.wipo.int|date = November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The History of Video and Related Innovations|url=http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blvideo.htm|journal=inventors.about.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959, [[Toshiba]] introduced a "new" method of recording known as helical scan, releasing the first commercial helical scan video tape recorder that year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://toshiba-mirai-kagakukan.jp/en/learn/history/ichigoki/1959vtr/index.htm World's First Helical Scan Video Tape Recorder], [[Toshiba]]&lt;/ref&gt; It was first implemented in [[reel-to-reel]] [[videotape recorder]]s (VTRs), and later used with cassette tapes.

In 1963 [[Philips]] introduced their EL3400 1-inch helical scan recorder, aimed at the business and domestic user, and [[Sony]] marketed the 2" PV-100, their first reel-to-reel VTR, intended for business, medical, airline, and educational use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sony.net/Fun/SH/1-11/h1.html |title=Sony Global - Sony History |publisher=Sony.net |date= |access-date=31 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090907081817/http://sony.net/Fun/SH/1-11/h1.html |archivedate=September 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== First home video recorders ====
The Telcan, produced by the UK Nottingham Electronic Valve Company in 1963, was the first home video recorder. It could be bought as a unit or in kit form for £60, equivalent to approximately £1,100 (over US$1,600) in 2014 currency. However, there were several drawbacks: it was expensive, was not easy to assemble, and could only record 20 minutes at a time. It recorded in black-and-white, the only format available in the UK at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.terramedia.co.uk/media/video/telcan.htm |title=The quest for home video: Telcan home video recorder |publisher=Terramedia.co.uk |date=22 October 2001 |access-date=31 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.totalrewind.org/revolution/R_telwes.htm |title=Total Rewind |publisher=Total Rewind |date= |access-date=31 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/aNhfBgCgSByEMns5XPxXqA |title=BBC History |publisher=BBC.co.uk |date=24 June 1963 |access-date=31 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The half-inch tape Sony model [[CV-2000]], first marketed in 1965, was their first VTR intended for home use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smecc.org/sony_cv_series_video.htm |title=Sony CV Series Video |publisher=Smecc.org |date= |access-date=31 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ampex and [[RCA]] followed in 1965 with their own reel-to-reel [[monochrome]] VTRs priced under [[United States dollar|US]]$1,000 for the home consumer market.

The [[EIAJ-1|EIAJ]] format was a standard half-inch format used by various manufacturers. EIAJ-1 was an open-reel format. EIAJ-2 used a cartridge that contained a supply reel; the take-up reel was part of the recorder, and the tape had to be fully rewound before removing the cartridge, a slow procedure.

The development of the videocassette followed the replacement by cassette of other open reel systems in consumer items: the [[Stereo-Pak]] four-track audio cartridge in 1962, the [[compact audio cassette]]  and [[Instamatic]] film cartridge in 1963, the [[Stereo 8|8-track cartridge]] in 1965, and the [[Super 8 mm film|Super 8]] home movie cartridge in 1966.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In 1972, videocassettes of movies became available for home use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cedmagic.com/history/cartrivision.html|title=Cartrivision - The First VCR with Prerecorded Sale/Rental Tapes in 1972|first=Tom|last=Howe|publisher=|access-date=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sony U-matic ====
{{Main|U-matic}}
Sony demonstrated a videocassette [[prototype]] in October 1969, then set it aside to work out an industry standard by March 1970 with seven fellow manufacturers. The result, the Sony [[U-matic]] system, introduced in Tokyo in September 1971, was the world's first commercial videocassette format. Its cartridges, resembling larger versions of the later [[VHS]] cassettes, used 3/4-inch (1.9&amp;nbsp;cm) tape and had a maximum playing time of 60 minutes, later extended to 80 minutes. Sony also introduced two machines (the VP-1100 videocassette player and the VO-1700, also called the VO-1600 video-cassette recorder) to use the new tapes. U-matic, with its ease of use, quickly made other consumer videotape systems obsolete in Japan and North America, where U-matic VCRs were widely used by television newsrooms (Sony BVU-150 and Trinitron DXC 1810 video camera) schools and businesses. But the high cost - {{US$|1,395}} in 1971 for a combination TV/VCR, equivalent to over $8000 in 2014 dollars – kept it out of most homes.&lt;ref&gt;Sony sold 15,000 U-matic machines in the U.S. in its first year. "Television on a Disk", ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', September 18, 1972. Nicknamed in latter years "Betamax-VHS" The U-matic  vcr Format was manufactured to as soon as 1990 arrived (VP means video player, VO means recorder "Video Office")&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Philips "VCR" format ====
{{Main|Video Cassette Recording}}
[[File:N1500 v2.jpg|right|thumb|240px|An N1500 video recorder, with wooden cabinet]]
In 1970, [[Philips]] developed a home video cassette format specially made for a TV station in 1970 and available on the consumer market in 1972. Philips named this format "[[Video Cassette Recording]]" (although it is also referred to as "N1500", after the first recorder's model number).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=VCR|url=http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/v/vcr.htm|journal=www.computerhope.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The format was also supported by [[Grundig]] and [[Loewe AG|Loewe]]. It used square cassettes and half-inch (1.3&amp;nbsp;cm) tape, mounted on coaxial reels, giving a recording time of one hour. The first model, available in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1972, was equipped with a simple timer that used rotary dials. At nearly £600, it was expensive and the format was relatively unsuccessful in the home market. This was followed by a digital timer version in 1975, the N1502. In 1977 a new, incompatible, long-play version ("VCR-LP") or N1700, which could use the same blank tapes, sold quite well to schools and colleges.

==== Avco Cartrivision ====
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2011}}
{{Main|Cartrivision}}
The [[Avco]] [[Cartrivision]] system, a combination television set and VCR from Cartridge Television Inc. that sold for US$1,350, was the first videocassette recorder to have pre-recorded tapes of popular movies available for rent. Like the Philips VCR format, the square Cartrivision cassette had the two reels of half-inch tape mounted on top of each other, but it could record up to 114 minutes, using an early form of [[video format]] that recorded every other [[field (video)|video field]] and played it back three times.

Cassettes of major movies such as ''[[The Bridge on the River Kwai]]'' and ''[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]]'' were ordered via catalog at a [[retailer]], delivered by parcel mail, and then returned to the retailer after viewing. Other cassettes on sports, travel, art, and [[how-to]] topics were available for purchase. An optional [[monochrome]] camera could be bought to make home videos. Cartrivision was first sold in June 1972, mainly through [[Sears, Roebuck and Company|Sears]], [[Macy's]], and [[Montgomery Ward]] [[department store]]s in the United States. The system was abandoned thirteen months later after poor sales.

=== Mass-market success ===
VCR started gaining mass market traction in 1975.  Six major firms were involved in the development of the VCR: [[RCA]], [[JVC]], [[AMPEX]], [[Panasonic|Matsushita Electric]] / Panasonic, [[Sony]], and [[Toshiba]].  Of these, the big winners in the growth of this industry were Japanese companies [[Panasonic|Matsushita Electric]] / Panasonic, [[JVC]], and [[Sony]], which developed more technically advanced machines with more accurate electronic timers and greater tape duration. The VCR started to become a mass market consumer product; by 1979 there were three competing technical standards using mutually incompatible tape cassettes.

The industry boomed in the 1980s as more and more customers bought VCRs. By 1982, 10% of households in the United Kingdom owned a VCR. The figure reached 30% in 1985 and by the end of the decade well over half of British homes owned a VCR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_pictures/4446012.stm |title=In Pictures &amp;#124; Thatcher years in graphics |publisher=BBC News |date=18 November 2005 |accessdate=20 January 2012 | page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier machines used mechanically-operated control switches; these were replaced by [[microswitch]]es, [[solenoid]]s and motor-driven mechanisms.

==== VHS vs. Betamax ====
{{Main|Videotape format war}}
[[File:Kaseta wideo w systemie Beta ubt.jpeg|right|thumb|A Betamax cassette]]
The two major standards were [[Sony]]'s [[Betamax]] (also known as Betacord or just Beta), and [[JVC]]'s [[VHS]] (Video Home System), which competed for sales in what became known as the [[Videotape format war|format war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediacollege.com/video/format/compare/betamax-vhs.html |title=The Betamax vs VHS Format War, Author: Dave Owen, Originally published: 2005 |publisher=Mediacollege.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Betamax was first to market in November 1975, and was argued by many to be technically more sophisticated in recording quality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.betainfoguide.com/BetaBetter.html  |title=Why is Beta better |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2007-06-08 |accessdate=31 May 2010 |archiveurl = https://archive.is/20070608042149/http://www.betainfoguide.com/BetaBetter.html |archivedate = 8 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; although many users did not perceive a visual difference. The first machines required an external timer, and could only record one hour, or two hours at lower quality (LP).  The timer was later incorporated within the machine as a standard feature.

The rival VHS format, introduced in Japan by JVC in September 1976, introduced in the United States in July 1977 by RCA, had a longer two-hour recording time with a T-120 tape, or four hours in lower-quality "long play" mode (RCA SelectaVision models, introduced in September 1977).

In 1978 the majority of consumers in the U.K. chose to rent rather than purchase this new expensive home entertainment technology{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}. JVC introduced the HR3300 model&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.totalrewind.org/vhs/H_3300.htm|title=JVC HR3300|publisher=Rewind museum company 2010|accessdate=16 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with E-30, E-60, (E-120 VHS-1 1976), E-180 minute cassette tapes with up to three hours=(VHS-2 1977)) recording time, a thinner 4 hour length (E240 tape VHS-3 1981) soon followed (E-400 VHS-5 last edition 1999).

The rental market was a contributing factor for acceptance of the VHS, for a variety of reasons. In those pre-digital days TV broadcasters could not offer the wide choice of a [[Video rental shop|rental store]], and tapes could be played as often as desired. Material was available on tape with violent or sexual scenes not available on broadcasts. Home [[video camera]]s allowed tapes to be recorded and played back.

Two hours and 4 hours recording times were considered enough for recording movies and sports. Although Sony later introduced L-500 (2 hour) and L-750 (3 hour) Betamax tapes in addition to the L-250 (1 hour) tape, the consumer market had swiftly moved toward the VHS system as a preferred choice. During the 1980s dual-speed (long play) models of both Beta and VHS recorders were introduced, allowing much longer recording times. The recording length on World Wide Standard on consumer video recorders (VHS) Was 8hrs with PAL colour encoding and 5hs-46mins with NTSC color encoding. The total recording length on The World Wide Standard On Professional Broadcasting (Betamax) was 3hrs 35mins on PAL colour configuration, and 5hrs on NTSC color configuration{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}{{Clarify|date=March 2014}}.

Longer tapes became available a few years later, extending to 10hrs and then 12hrs LP on PAL (Europe) and 7hrs 50mins and then further extended with VHS-5 (Final edition of the Video Home System) in 1999 TO 8hrs 16mins on NTSC (North America, Japan). Betamax tape length was extended only using a DigiBetacam-40 or HDCAM cassette to 4hrs 20mins on PAL and 6hrs 30mins on NTSC models.
[[File:Vr2020.jpg|left|thumb|Philips V2000 format video cassette recorder]]

With the introduction of DVD recorders, combined VHS and DVD recorders were produced, allowing both types of media to be played, and transfer of tape material to DVD.

==== Philips Video 2000 ====
{{Main|Video 2000}}
A third format, [[Video 2000]], or V2000 (also marketed as "Video Compact Cassette") was developed and introduced by [[Philips]] in 1978, sold only in [[Europe]]. Grundig developed and marketed their own models based on the V2000 format. Most V2000 models featured [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]] head positioning to dynamically adjust [[tape tracking]]. V2000 cassettes had two sides, and like the [[Compact audio cassette|audio cassette]] could be flipped over halfway through their recording time, which gave them up to twice the recording length of VHS tapes. User switchable record-protect levers were used instead of the breakable lugs on VHS and Beta cassettes.

The half-inch tape used contained two parallel quarter-inch tracks, one for each side. It had a recording time of 4 hours per side, later extended to 8 hours per side on a few models. Machines had a 'real time' tape position counter with the information retained on the tape, so when tapes were loaded the position was known; this feature was only implemented on VHS recorders much later. V2000 became available in early 1979, later than its two rivals. The V2000 system did not sell well, and was discontinued in 1985.

==== Other early formats ====
Some less successful consumer videocassette formats include:
*[[V-Cord]], launched by [[Sanyo]] in 1974
*[[VX (videocassette format)|VX]], launched by [[Panasonic]] in 1975
*[[Compact Video Cassette]] (CVC), developed by [[Funai]] and [[Technicolor]] and introduced in 1980.

=== Legal challenges ===
In the early 1980s US film companies fought to suppress the VCR in the consumer market, citing concerns about copyright violations. In Congressional hearings, [[Motion Picture Association of America]] head [[Jack Valenti]] decried the "savagery and the ravages of this machine" and likened its effect on the film industry and the American public to the [[Boston strangler]]:

{{quote|I say to you that the VCR is to the American film producer and the American public as the Boston strangler is to the woman home alone.|Hearings before the Subcommittee on Courts, Civil Liberties and the Administration of Justice of the Committee of the Judiciary, House of Representatives, Ninety-seventh Congress, Second Session on H.R. 4783, H.R. 4794 H.R. 4808, H.R. 5250, H.R. 5488, and H.R. 5705, Serial No 97, Part I, Home Recording of Copyrighted Works, April 12, 1982. US Government Printing Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cryptome.org/hrcw-hear.htm |title=Jack Valenti Testimony at 1982 House Hearing on Home Recording of Copyrighted Works |publisher=Cryptome.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the case ''[[Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.]]'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled that the device was allowable for private use. Subsequently the film companies found that making and selling video recordings of their productions had become a major income source.

== Shortcomings ==
The video cassette recorder is sensitive to changes in temperature and humidity. If the machine (or tape) was moved from a cold to a hotter environment there could be condensation of moisture on the internal parts, such as the rotating video head drum. Some later models were equipped with a [[dew warning|moisture detector]] which would prevent operation in this case, but it could not detect moisture on the surface of a tape.

Magnetic tapes could be mechanically damaged when ejected from the machine due to moisture or other problems. Rubber drive belts and rollers hardened with age, causing malfunctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repairfaq.org/REPAIR/F_vcrfaq4.html#VCRFAQ_001|title=VCR eats tapes|publisher=The Sci.Electronics.Repair (S.E.R) FAQ|accessdate=16 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faults such as these damaged the tape irreversibly, a particular problem with irreplaceable tapes filmed by users. VHS tapes recorded in LP or EP/SLP mode were more sensitive to minor head misalignment over time or from machine to machine. Tapes recorded on a machine made before 1995 tend to not play well on newer machines due to slight changes in [[Helix|helical]] scanning head design{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}.

== Decline ==
[[File:VCR-03.jpg|thumb|A typical VCR toward the end of their popularity. After decades of refinement in design and production, models similar to this were available for less than [[United States dollar|US$]]50.]]
The videocassette recorder remained in home use throughout the 1980s and 1990s, despite the advent of competing technologies such as [[LaserDisc]] (LD) and [[Video CD]] (VCD). While Laserdisc offered higher quality video and audio, the discs are heavy (weighing about one pound each), cumbersome, much more prone to damage if dropped or mishandled, and furthermore only home LD players, not recorders, were available. The VCD format found a niche with Asian film imports, but did not sell widely. Many Hollywood studios did not release feature films on VCD in North America because the VCD format had no means of preventing perfect copies being made on CD-R discs, which were already popular when the format was introduced. In an attempt to lower costs, manufacturers began dropping nonessential features from their VCR models. The built-in display was dropped in favor of [[on screen display]] for setup, programming, and status, and many buttons were eliminated from the VCR's front panel, their functions accessible only from the VCR's [[remote control]].

From about 2000 [[DVD]] became the first universally successful optical medium for playback of pre-recorded video, as it gradually overtook VHS to become the most popular consumer format.  [[DVD recorder]]s and other [[digital video recorder]]s  dropped rapidly  in price, making the VCR obsolete.  DVD rentals in the United States first exceeded those of VHS in June 2003. {{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

The declining market combined with a US [[Federal Communications Commission]] mandate effective March 1, 2007, that all new TV tuners in the US be [[ATSC tuner]]s encouraged major electronics makers, except Funai, JVC, and Panasonic, to end production of standalone units for the US market. Most new standalone VCRs in the US since then can only record from external [[baseband]] sources (usually [[composite video]]), including [[Coupon-eligible converter box|CECBs]] which (by [[National Telecommunications and Information Administration|NTIA]] mandate) all have composite outputs, as well as those ATSC tuners (including TVs) and cable boxes that come with composite outputs. However, JVC did ship one model of [[D-VHS]] deck with a built-in ATSC tuner, the HM-DT100U, but it remains extremely rare, and therefore expensive.&lt;!-- (a recent listing for one on eBay was sold to a winning bid of $630 USD) --&gt; In July 2016, Funai Electric, the last remaining manufacturer of VHS recorders, announced it would cease production of VHS recorders by the end of the month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/22/vhs-betamax-japan|title=VHS is dead, but at least it outlived Betamax tapes by nine months|publisher=Guardian|language=English|author=Samuel Gibbs|date=22 July 2016|accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://screencrush.com/rip-vhs-vcr/|title=VHS, Beloved Home Video Format, Dies at 40|website=ScreenCrush|access-date=2016-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of winning the [[High definition optical disc format war|format war]] over [[HD DVD]], the new [[high-definition television|high definition]] optical disc format [[Blu-ray Disc]] was expected to replace the [[DVD]] format.  However, with many homes still having a large supply of VHS tapes and with all Blu-ray players designed to play regular DVDs and [[Compact Disc|CDs]] by [[:wikt:default|default]], some manufacturers began to make [[VCR/Blu-ray combo]] players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=SquareTrade |url=https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-DMP-BD70V-Blu-ray-Multimedia-Player/dp/B001VZ1W5U/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=electronics&amp;qid=1277226480&amp;sr=8-1 |title=Panasonic DMP-BD70V Blu-ray Disc/VHS Multimedia Player: Electronics |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Remaining niche in recording ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
Although consumers have passed over videocassettes for home video playback in favor of DVDs since the early 2000s, VCRs still retained a significant share in home video recording during that decade. While the adoption of DVD players has been strong, [[DVD recorder]]s for home theater use have been slow to pick up (although DVD recorder-writer drives became de facto standard equipment in [[personal computer]]s in the mid-2000s).

Although technologically superior to VHS, there were several main drawbacks with recordable DVDs that slowed their adoption. When standalone DVD recorders first appeared on the [[Japan]]ese consumer market in 1999, these early units were very expensive, costing between $2500 and $4000 ([[United States dollar|USD]]). (As of early 2007, DVD recorders from notable brands are selling for US$200 or €150 and less, with even lower "street prices".) Different DVD recordable formats also caused confusion, as early units supported only [[DVD-RAM]] and [[DVD-R]] discs, but the more recent units can record to all major formats [[DVD-R]], [[DVD-RW]], [[DVD+R]], [[DVD+RW]], [[DVD-R DL]] and [[DVD+R DL]]. Some of these DVD formats are not rewritable, whereas videocassettes could be recorded over repeatedly (notwithstanding physical wear). Another important drawback of DVD recording is that one single-layer DVD is limited to around 120 minutes of recording if the quality is not to be significantly reduced, while VHS tapes are readily available up to 210 minutes (standard play) in NTSC areas and even 300 minutes in PAL areas. [[Dual layer DVD]]s, which increase the high quality recording mode to almost four hours, are increasingly available, but the cost of this medium was still relatively high compared to standard single-layer discs. Another factor was the increasing use of digital [[video file formats]] and online [[video sharing]], skipping physical media entirely. For these reasons, DVD recorders never took hold of the video recording market like VCRs had.

[[Digital video recorder]]s have since come to dominate the market for home recording of television shows.

== Special features ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2011}}

=== Multi standard ===
One of the problems faced with the use of video recorders was the exchange of recordings between PAL, SECAM and NTSC countries.   [[Multi-standard television|Multi Standard]] video recorders and TV sets gradually overcame these incompatibility problems.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

=== High quality audio (Nicam, AFM, and HiFi) ===
{{see also|NICAM}}
The [[U-matic]] machines were always made with [[Stereo]], and both [[Betamax]] and [[VHS]] recorded the audio tracks using a fixed linear recording head. However the relatively slow tape speed of Beta and VHS was inadequate for good quality audio, and significantly limited the sound quality. Betamax's release of Beta Hi-Fi in the early 1980s was quickly followed by [[JVC]]s release of HiFi audio on VHS (model HR-D725U). Both systems delivered flat full-range frequency response (20&amp;nbsp;Hz to 20&amp;nbsp;kHz), excellent 70&amp;nbsp;dB [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (in consumer space, second only to the [[compact disc]]), [[dynamic range]] of 90&amp;nbsp;dB, and [[professional audio]]-grade channel separation (more than 70&amp;nbsp;dB). In VHS the incoming HiFi audio is [[frequency modulated]] ("Audio FM" or "AFM"), modulating the two stereo channels (L, R) on two different frequency-modulated carriers and recorded using the same [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|high-bandwidth]] [[helical scan]]ning technique used for the video signal. To avoid crosstalk and interference from the primary video carrier, VHS used ''depth [[multiplexing]]'', in which the modulated [[Sound recording|audio]] carrier pair was placed in the hitherto-unused frequency range between the luminance and the color carrier (below 1.6&amp;nbsp;MHz), and recorded first. Subsequently, the video head erases and re-records the video signal (combined luminance and color signal) over the same tape surface, but the video signal's higher center frequency results in a shallower magnetization of the tape, allowing both the video and residual AFM audio signal to coexist on tape. (PAL versions of Beta Hi-Fi use the same technique). During playback, VHS Hi-Fi recovers the depth-recorded AFM signal by subtracting the audio head's signal (which contains the AFM signal contaminated by a weak image of the video signal) from the video head's signal (which contains only the video signal), then demodulates the left and right audio channels from their respective frequency carriers. The end result of the complex process is audio of outstanding fidelity, which was uniformly solid across all tape-speeds (EP, LP or SP.)

Such devices were often described as "HiFi audio", "Audio FM" / "AFM" (FM standing for "Frequency Modulation"), and sometimes informally as "Nicam" VCRs (due to their use in recording the Nicam broadcast audio signal). They remained compatible with non-HiFi VCR players since the standard audio track was also recorded, and were at times used as an alternative to [[audio cassette tape]]s due to their exceptional bandwidth, frequency range, and extremely flat [[frequency response]].

The [[8 mm video format|8 mm format]] always used the video portion of the tape for sound, with an FM carrier between the band space of the [[chrominance]] and [[luminance]] on the tape. 8&amp;nbsp;mm could be upgraded to Stereo, by adding an extra FM signal for Stereo difference.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

The professional [[Betacam SP]] format of videocassette also used AFM on the higher-end "BVW"-series of Betacam SP deck models from [[Sony]] (such as the BVW-75) to offer 2 extra tracks of audio alongside the 2 standard [[Dolby C]]-encoded linear audio tracks for the format, for a total of 4 audio tracks.   However, the 2 AFM tracks were accessible only on those decks equipped with AFM audio (like the BVW-75).

====Quality====
Due to the path followed by the video and Hi-Fi audio heads being striped and discontinuous—unlike that of the linear audio track—head-switching is required to provide a continuous audio signal. While the video signal can easily hide the head-switching point in the invisible vertical retrace section of the signal, so that the exact switching point is not very important, the same is obviously not possible with a continuous audio signal that has no inaudible sections. Hi-Fi audio is thus dependent on a much more exact alignment of the head switching point than is required for non-HiFi VHS machines. Misalignments may lead to imperfect joining of the signal, resulting in low-pitched buzzing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stason.org/TULARC/entertainment/audio/general/14-18-Is-VHS-Hi-Fi-sound-perfect-Is-Beta-Hi-Fi-sound-perfec.html14.18|title=14.18 Is VHS Hi-Fi sound perfect? Is Beta Hi-Fi sound perfect?|first=Stas Bekman: stas (at)|last=stason.org|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem is known as "head chatter", and tends to increase as the audio heads wear down.

The sound quality of Hi-Fi VHS stereo is comparable to the quality of CD audio, particularly when recordings were made on high-end or professional VHS machines that have a manual audio recording level control. This high quality compared to other consumer audio recording formats such as [[compact cassette]] attracted the attention of amateur and hobbyist recording artists. [[Home recording]] enthusiasts occasionally recorded high quality stereo [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixdown]]s and [[master recording]]s from [[multitrack recording|multitrack]] audio tape onto consumer-level Hi-Fi VCRs.  However, because the VHS Hi-Fi recording process is intertwined with the VCR's video-recording function, advanced editing functions such as audio-only or video-only dubbing are impossible.  A short-lived alternative to the hifi feature for recording mixdowns of hobbyist audio-only projects was a [[PCM adaptor]] so that high-bandwidth digital video could use a grid of black-and-white dots on an analog video carrier to give pro-grade digital sounds though [[Digital Audio Tape|DAT]] tapes made this obsolete.

=== Copy protection ===
{{See also|Copy protection}}
Introduced in 1983, [[Macrovision]] is a system that reduces the quality of recordings made from commercial video tapes, [[DVD]]s and [[pay-per-view]] broadcasts by adding random peaks of luminance to the video signal during [[vertical blanking]]. These confuse the automatic level adjustment of the recording VCR which causes the brightness of the picture to constantly change, rendering the recording unwatchable.

When creating a copy-protected videocassette, the Macrovision-distorted signal is stored on the tape itself by special recording equipment. By contrast, on DVDs there is just a marker asking the player to produce such a distortion during playback. All standard [[DVD]] players include this protection and obey the marker, though unofficially many models can be modified or adjusted to disable it.

Also, the Macrovision protection system may fail to work on older VCR's made before 1986 and some high end decks built afterwards, usually due to the lack of an [[Automatic Gain Control|AGC]] system.  Newer VHS and [[S-VHS]] machines (and DVD recorders) are susceptible to this signal; generally, machines of other tape formats are unaffected, such as all 3 Betamax variants.  VCRs designated for "professional" usage typically have an adjustable AGC system, a specific "Macrovision removing" circuit, or [[Time Base Corrector]] (TBC) and can thus copy protected tapes with or without preserving the protection. Such VCRs are usually overpriced and sold exclusively to certified professionals ([[linear editing]] using the [[9-Pin Protocol]], TV stations etc.) via controlled distribution channels in order to prevent their being used by the general public (however, said professional VCRs can be purchased reasonably by consumers on the second-hand/used market, depending on the VCR's condition). Nowadays, most DVDs still have copyright protection, but certain DVDs do not have it, usually pornography and bootlegs. However, some DVDs, such as certain DVD sets, do not have the protection against VHS copying, possibly due to the VHS format no longer used as a major retail medium for home video.

=== Flying erase heads {{anchor|flyerase}} ===

The flying erase head is a feature that may be found in some high end home VCRs as well as some broadcast grade VCRs to cleanly edit the [[video]].

Normally, the tape is passed longitudinally through two fixed erase heads, one located just before the tape moves to the video head drum and the other right next to the audio/control head stack.  Upon recording, the erase heads erase any old recording contained on the tape to prevent anything already recorded on it from interfering with what is being recorded.

However, when trying to edit footage deck to deck, portions of the old recording's video may be between the erase head and video recording heads.  This results in a faint rainbow-like noise at and briefly after the point of the cut as the old video recording missed by the fixed erase head is never completely erased as the new recording is printed.

The flying erase head is so-called because an erase head is mounted on the video head drum and rotates around in the same manner as the video heads.  In the record mode, the erase head is active and erases the video precisely down to the recorded video fields.  The flying erase head runs over the tape and the video heads record the signal virtually instantly after the flying erase head has passed.

Since the erase head erases the old signal right before the video heads write onto the tape, there is no remnant of the old signal to cause visible distortion at and after the moment a cut is made, resulting in a clean edit.  In addition, the ability of flying erase heads to erase old video off the tape right before recording new video on it allows the ability to perform insert editing, where new footage can be placed within an existing recording with clean cuts at the beginning and end of the edit.

== Variants ==
In addition to the standard home VCR, a number of variants have been produced over the years. These include combined "all-in-one" devices such as the [[TV/VCR combo]] (a TV and VCR in one unit) and [[VCR/DVD combo|DVD/VCR units]] and even TV/VCR/DVD all-in-one units.

Dual-deck VCRs (marketed as "double-decker") have also been sold, albeit with less success.

Most [[camcorder]]s produced in the 20th century also feature an integrated VCR. Generally, they include neither a timer nor a TV tuner. Most of these use smaller format videocassettes, such as [[8 mm video format|8 mm]], [[VHS-C]], or [[DV|MiniDV]], although some early models supported full-size VHS and Betamax. In the 21st century, digital recording became the norm while videocassette tapes dwindled away gradually; [[tapeless camcorder]]s use other storage media such as DVDs, or internal [[flash memory]], [[hard drive]], and [[Secure Digital|SD card]].&lt;ref name="camcorderinfo1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.camcorderinfo.com/2011-CES-Camcorders.htm |title=CES 2011 Camcorder Coverage |publisher=CamcorderInfo.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07}}{{dead link|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Paul Travers founded Vuzix in 1997 in Rochester, NY, under the name Interactive Imaging Systems, purchasing the assets of the [[virtual reality]] company Forte Technologies. The company started with products for the military and U.S. Defense, but then developed consumer virtual reality systems and was the first company to deliver consumer [[virtual reality]]. The Company has offices in New York, Japan, and the UK and is the current market leader for video eyewear{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}. Forte was a pioneer during the mid-1990s developing immersive head mounted displays&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FORTE VFX-1 HEADGEAR Virtual-Reality system.|url=http://museum.bounce-gaming.net/vfx1.html|publisher=Museum of Interesting Tech}}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[Virtual Reality]] and video gaming applications.

In 1997, the Company was hired as a subcontractor to [[Raytheon]], designing display electronics for a digital [[AN/PAS-13|night vision weapon sight]].

In 2000, the [[VFX1 Headgear]] was featured in a commemorative US Postal Service stamp collection celebrating the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Celebrate the Century - 1990s - No. 10 of 10 - U.S. Postal Service - 2000|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000VG9ML6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The VFX1 was replaced by a higher resolution system dubbed the VFX3D in mid 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unofficial VFX3D page|url=http://www.stereo3d.com/vfx3d.htm|work=Stereo3D.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Vuzix launched its first consumer electronics product, the iCOM personal internet browser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hendricks|first=Veronica|title=iCOM Personal Internet Browser|url=http://www.iapplianceweb.com/appreview/handheld_computers_14.htm|accessdate=2011-06-29|newspaper=iApplianceWeb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Vuzix provided a custom high resolution handheld display system that created the 3D imagery for  Hitachi's pavilion at the 2005 World’s Fair in Aichi, Japan. The Hitachi Pavilion allowed users to interact with computer generated models and dioramas of endangered species in a  Mixed Reality ride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nature Contact - Hitachi Group Pavilion's Ubiquitous Entertainment Ride|url=http://www.expo2005.or.jp/en/venue/pavilion_private_f.html|work=Expor2005.or.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the company changed its name to Icuiti.  Later that year, Icuiti launched its first product designed specifically for consumers, the V920 Video Eyewear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VR Interfaces: Icuiti V920|url=http://www.virtualworldlets.net/Shop/ProductsDisplay/VRInterface.php?ID=2|work=virtualworldlets.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2005, Icuiti was awarded its first military R&amp;D contract to develop a high resolution monocular display device for viewing tactical maps and video.  This development would lead to the Tac-Eye product line, which began rate production in 2009 and is currently used in many major military programs including the Battlefield Air Operations kit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NDIA Brief|url=http://www.ndiagulfcoast.com/events/archive/34th_Symposium/34_Day1/12_AFSOC_NDIA_Brief.pdf|accessdate=2011-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A re-branding in 2007 changed the Company's name from Icuiti to  Vuzix.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/icuiti-changes-name-to-vuzix-corporation-57757517.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Vuzix introduced the first production model see-through [[augmented reality]] glasses the STAR 1200.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vuzix Star 1200 headset augments your reality, not your bank account|url=https://www.engadget.com/2011/06/11/vuzix-star-1200-headset-augments-your-reality-not-your-bank-acc/|work=Engadget.com|publisher=AOL Tech.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released in August 2011 for $4999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=0Vuzix Star 1200: Price and Release Date for Augmented-Reality Glasses|url=http://pinoytutorial.com/techtorial/vuzix-star-1200-price-and-release-date-for-augmented-reality-glasses/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[file:Webbing.jpg|thumb|2 inch (50 mm) [[Nylon]] webbing as used in [[auto racing]] harnesses]]

'''Webbing''' is a strong [[cloth|fabric]] [[weaving|woven]] as a flat strip or tube of varying width and [[fibre]]s, often used in place of [[rope]]. It is a versatile component used in [[climbing]], [[slacklining]], [[furniture]] [[manufacturing]], [[automobile]] [[safety]], [[auto racing]], [[tow truck|towing]], [[parachuting]], [[battledress|military apparel]], [[load securing]], and many other fields.

Originally made of [[cotton]] or [[flax]], most modern webbing is made of synthetic fibers such as [[nylon]], [[polypropylene]] or [[polyester]]. Webbing is also made from exceptionally high-strength material, such as [[Dyneema]], and [[Kevlar]]. Webbing is both light and strong, with [[Tensile strength|breaking strengths]] readily available in excess of 10,000 [[Pound-force|lb]] (44.4 k[[newton (units)|N]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Cordage, Rope, and Webbing Information {{!}} IHS Engineering360|url = http://www.globalspec.com/learnmore/materials_chemicals_adhesives/composites_textiles_reinforcements/cordage_rope_webbing|website = www.globalspec.com|access-date = 2016-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two basic constructions of webbing. Flat webbing is a solid weave, with [[seatbelts]] and most backpack straps being common examples. Tubular webbing consists of a flattened tube, and is commonly used in climbing and industrial applications.

== Uses ==

=== Sporting goods ===

In rock climbing, nylon webbing is used in [[sling (climbing equipment)|slings]], runners, [[climbing harness|harnesses]], anchor extensions and [[quickdraw]]s. Webbing is used in many ways in [[hiking]] and [[camping]] gear including [[backpacks]], straps, load adjusters and [[tent]] adjusters. There are two types of webbing: tubular and flat. The most popular webbing is one inch, but it is available in two and three inch widths.

Narrower webbing is frequently looped through [[Nut (climbing)|chockstones]], which are jammed into cracks as safety anchors. In other cases, webbing is looped over rock outcroppings. Webbing is less likely to inch its way off the rock than tubular rope. Note that webbing construction is either utterly flat or flat-tubular; the latter tends to handle better but knots are more likely to jam.

The most popular knots in webbing are the [[water knot]] and the [[grapevine knot]]. The latter is stronger, but uses more webbing for the knot. It is customary to leave a few centimetres extending from the knot, and in many cases climbers tape the ends down onto the main loops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://opp.uoregon.edu/climbing/topics/knots.pdf|title = Knots for Rock Climbers {{!}} Knot Selection and Care|date = 2010-08-10|access-date = 2016-01-11|website = University of Oregon|publisher = |last = Strong|first = Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Webbing is also less expensive than rope of similar size, particularly [[kernmantle rope]], which requires elaborate and expensive manufacturing. Unlike climbing rope, which is generally sold with recognizable brand names, webbing manufacture is typically generic. Climbing shops sell it off of a spool on a per yard or per foot basis.

Webbing is cut with a hot wire as is nylon rope, which prevents fraying and unravelling. However, when webbing does fray and unravel, the result is less disastrous than with rope, providing a modest advantage. Webbing suffers the drawback of less elasticity than perlon rope, and it may be more difficult to handle with gloves or mittens on.&lt;ref&gt;Royal Robbins, Basic Rockcraft&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Royal Robbins, Advanced Rockcraft&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Freedom of the Hills by the Seattle Mountaineers&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Slacklining|Slacklines]] often use flat or tubular 1-inch (2.5&amp;nbsp;cm) webbing, or flat 2-inch (5&amp;nbsp;cm) webbing. Other widths are used, but are less common.

[[White water rafting]] boats use tubular webbing for bow lines, stern lines, "chicken lines" (around the exterior perimeter of the boat), equipment tie down, or floor lacing for self-bailing rafts. Rafters call tubular webbing "hoopie" or "hoopi". Rafters also use [[camstraps]] with flat webbing for equipment tie down.

[[Personal flotation device|Life preservers]] are also crafted using nylon or cotton webbing that conforms to federal standards and guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 46 CFR 160.055-3 - Materials|url = https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/46/160.055-3|website = Cornell University Law School {{!}} Legal Information Institute|publisher = |access-date = 2016-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Automotive and racing safety ===

[[Seat belt]]s are an obvious example of webbings used in auto safety but there are myriad other uses. Nylon and polyester webbing are used a great deal in auto racing safety for a large variety of items. [[seat belt|Racing harnesses]] restraining the driver have used nylon webbing for years, but since the death of [[Dale Earnhardt#Death|Dale Earnhardt]] polyester webbing is becoming more popular due to its increased strength, and lower rate of elongation under load. The nylon commercial type 9 webbing generally used in racing harnesses stretches approximately 20 to 30 percent of its initial length at 2500 [[Pound-force|lb]] (11.1 k[[Newton (units)|N]]) while polyester only stretches 5 to 15 percent. Window nets to prevent objects from entering the driver compartment are constructed of polypropylene webbing, as are helmet nets used to reduce side loads to the head in [[Sprint car racing|Sprint cars]]. The [[HANS device]] uses webbing tethers to attach the helmet to the collar, and the [[Hutchens device]] is made almost entirely of webbing.

=== Furniture ===
Webbing is used in couches and chairs as a base for the seating areas that is both strong and flexible. Webbing used as a support is often rubberised to improve resilience and add elasticity. Many types of outdoor furniture use little more than thin light webbing for the seating areas. Webbing is also used to reinforce joints and areas that tend to flex.

=== Military ===
Military webbing, otherwise known as [[Mil-spec|Mil-Spec]] webbing, is typically made of strips of woven narrow fabrics of high tensile strength, such as Nylon, Kevlar, and [[Nomex]].  When these materials are used for parachute and ballooning applications, they must also conform to PIA ([[Parachute Industry Association]]) standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = MIL-Spec and PIA-Spec {{!}} Bally Ribbon Mills
 |url = http://www.ballyribbon.com/products/core-products/mil-spec-pia-spec
 |website = www.ballyribbon.com|access-date = 2016-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mil-Spec webbing is used to make military belts, packs, pouches, and other forms of [[List of webbing equipment|webbing equipment]].  The [[British Army]] adopted cotton webbing to replace [[leather]] after the [[Second Boer War]] although leather belts are still worn in more formal dress.  The term is still used for a soldier's combat equipment, although cotton webbing has since been replaced with stronger materials.  The webbing system used by the British Army today is known as [[Personal Load Carrying Equipment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Modern British Webbing Equipment
 |last = Howlett|first = Simon
 |publisher = The Crowood Press UK
 |date = 2010-02-15|isbn = 978-1847971401|location = UK|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Americans use [[All-purpose Lightweight Individual Carrying Equipment]] and [[MOLLE]].

Generally, a soldier is also provided a [[rucksack]] to carry survival items for anywhere between 24 hours and a week.  Webbing is designed so that if the pack is lost or abandoned, the soldier can survive on emergency rations, water and clothing, carried in it for up to 24 hours, or longer if the supplies are rationed.

Typical contents of military webbing equipment include cooking equipment, 24 hours worth of rations, water, ammunition, first aid  or survival supplies, cold weather/rain gear, anti-gas/CBRN gear and sheltering equipment (such as a tent quarter/[[shelter half]], poles, rope, etc.).  Items are generally stored in an ordered fashion in a combination of ammo and utility pouches.  The ammo pouches are reserved for ammunition in the form of magazines, however it is common for soldiers to store their weapon cleaning kit in the same pouch.

In the first utility pouch, soldiers generally store their mess tins, pellet stoves, a lighter or waterproof matches, and enough rations to last 24 hours.  In the second utility pouch is the army issue canteen and cup.  The canteen can hold one liter of water.  The mug has two folding  metal handles which give the user a cool place to hold it while drinking a warm beverage.  The third utility pouch contains a minor [[first aid kit]], for minor cuts and scrapes, but not the first field dressing.  This pouch may also contain various other items such as binoculars, a red light torch, a utility knife, or a compass.  Other pouches can be attached for more storage capabilities.  Examples include the Bowman radio pouch for the PRC 349 or the PRR pouch for the personal role radio.  These pouches are more expensive due to their limited manufacture.

Most military webbing systems incorporate a degree of [[modular construction]] with a yoke (shoulder harness), a belt and pouches specific to different loads, for example ammunition magazines may have dividers, special waterproofing, and/or tabs to help lift the magazines out.  Different combinations of pouches can be used to suit the mission.  In some better models the pouches are sewn directly onto a hip pad which prevents bouncing of the pouches and makes the webbing more comfortable.

It is unusual for western armies to fight while wearing a pack, and so prior to anticipated contact with the enemy the pack is usually stowed away from the [[forward edge of the battle area]] and webbing is used instead.  Webbing belts are also used frequently by modern cadet and scout groups, as well as police and security forces.

=== Transportation ===
Tie downs, tie straps, cargo straps, [[E-track]] straps, cargo hoist straps, tow ropes, winch straps, [[cargo net]]s, and dozens of other items are used by thousands of shipping and trucking companies every day. The transportation industry is perhaps the largest user of high strength webbing in the world.

=== Apparel ===

[[Belt (clothing)|Belts]], [[suspenders|suspenders/braces]], [[Sandal (footwear)|sandal]]s and [[Handbag|handbags/purses]] are woven from various forms of webbing. Corset-style [[back brace]]s and other medical braces often incorporate straps made from webbing.

=== Pet collars and leashes ===

[[Dog collar]]s, [[leash]]es, and dog harnesses frequently utilize webbing to make collars and leashes. While [[nylon]] and [[polyester]] are most common, [[polypropylene]] can also be used. These pet products are often sewn together with decorative ribbon or cotton fabric.

=== Hardware ===

Webbing is often outfitted with various forms of [[tie down hardware]] to extend its range of abilities (and create [[tie down straps]]). This hardware can take the form of:

* End fittings (S-hooks, snap hooks, bolt/anchor plates, J-hooks, flat hooks, etc.)
* Fasteners (over-center, cam, ratchet, etc.)
* Buckles (slide buckles, snap buckles, etc.)

There is also hardware associated with the various end fittings to attach them to a surface, such as footman's loops, brackets and E-track fittings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39098">Several binary representations of [[character encoding|character sets]] for common Western European languages are compared in this article. These encodings were designed for representation of [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[English language|English]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], which use the [[Latin alphabet]], a few additional letters and ones with precomposed [[diacritic]]s, some punctuation, and various symbols (including some Greek letters). Although they're called "Western European" many of these languages are spoken all over the world. Also, these character sets happen to support many other languages such as [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]], and [[Latin language|Classical Latin]]. 

''This material is technically obsolete, having been functionally replaced by [[Unicode]]. However it continues to have historical interest.''

== Summary ==
The [[ISO-8859]] series of 8-bit character sets encodes all Latin character sets used in [[Europe]], albeit that the same code points have multiple uses that caused some difficulty.  The arrival of [[Unicode]], with a unique code point for every [[glyph]], resolved these issues.

* [[ISO/IEC 8859-1]] or '''Latin-1''' is the most used and also defines the first 256 codes in Unicode
* [[ISO/IEC 8859-15]] modifies ISO-8859-1 to fully support Estonian, Finnish and French and add the [[euro sign]].
* [[Windows-1252]] is a superset of [[ISO-8859-1]] that includes the characters from [[ISO-8859-15]] and popular punctuation such as curved quotation marks. It is common that web page tools for Windows use Windows-1252 but label the web page as using ISO-8859-1, this has been addressed in HTML 5, which mandates that pages labeled as ISO-8859-1 must be interpreted as Windows-1252.
* IBM [[Code page 437|CP437]], being intended for English only, has very little in the way of accented letters but has far more graphics characters than the others and also some Greek characters that are useful as technical symbols.
* IBM [[Code page 850|CP850]] has all the printable characters that ISO-8859-1 has (albeit arranged differently) and still manages to have enough graphics characters to build a usable text-mode user interface.
* IBM [[Code page 858|CP858]] differs from CP850 only by one character — a ''dotless i'' (ı), rarely used outside Turkey, was replaced by ''euro currency sign'' (€).&lt;ref name="IBM2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-01.ibm.com/software/globalization/cp/cp00858.html |title=00858 |work=Code pages by CPGID |publisher=[[IBM]] |access-date=2016-06-06 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606181537/https://www-01.ibm.com/software/globalization/cp/cp00858.html |archive-date=2016-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* IBM [[Code page 859|CP859]] contains all the printable characters that ISO-8859-15 has, so unlike CP850 it supports the €, Finnish and French.
* IBM code pages [[EBCDIC 037|037]], [[EBCDIC 500|500]], and [[EBCDIC 1047|1047]] are [[EBCDIC]] encodings that include all of the ISO-8859-1 characters.
* The [[Mac OS Roman]] character set (often referred to as MacRoman and known by the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] as simply MACINTOSH) has most, but not all, of the same characters as ISO-8859-1 but in a very different arrangement; and it also adds many technical and mathematical characters (though it lacks the important ×) and more diacritics. Older Macintosh [[web browser]]s were known to [[Mung (computer term)|munge]] the few characters that were in ISO-8859-1 but not their native Macintosh character set when editing text from Web sites.  Conversely, in Web material prepared on an older Macintosh, many characters were displayed incorrectly when read by other operating systems.

==History==
The earlier seven-[[bit]] U.S. [[ASCII]] encoding has characters sufficient to properly represent only English, Latin, and Swahili.  It is missing some letters and letter-diacritic combinations used in other Latin-alphabet languages. However, since there was no other choice on most U.S.-supplied computer platforms, ASCII was unavoidable in most of the non-English-speaking world (seven-bit encoding was necessitated by the limitations of early computing networks). There was the [[ISO 646]] group of encodings which replaced some of the symbols in ASCII with local characters, but space was very limited, and some of the symbols replaced were quite common in things like programming languages. &lt;!-- In the UK, ICL added the £ sign.  In France, Bull reused many of the "programming" symbols with accented letters.  In Russia, Cyrillic was ubiquitous.  This para needs rewriting --&gt;

Although seven-bit communication was the norm, most computers internally used eight-bit bytes, and they mostly put some form of characters in the 128 higher byte positions. In the early days most of these were system specific, but gradually a few standards were settled on.

In recent years, as storage and memory costs fall, the issues associated with multiple meanings of a given eight-bit code (there are seven ISO-Latin code sets alone) have ceased to be justified.  All major operating systems have moved to [[Unicode]] as their main internal representation. However Windows does not support Unicode using their 8-bit character interfaces (by supporting [[UTF-8]] in standard interfaces such as &lt;tt&gt;fopen&lt;/tt&gt;), so many applications continue to be restricted to these legacy character sets.

===The euro sign===
The [[euro]] and its [[euro sign]] introduced significant pressure to support the euro sign (€), and most 8-bit character sets had to be adapted in some way.
* Apple with MacRoman and [[Sun Microsystems]] with [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris OS]] simply replaced the generic currency sign ([[¤]]). This caused significant difficulty because organisations had found other uses for it, such as the company logo. 
* ISO introduced a further variant of ISO 8859, [[ISO 8859-15]], which replaced the generic currency sign with the euro sign as well as making some other replacements of symbols with letters with diacritics. ISO 8859-15 never received widespread adoption.
* [[Windows-1252]] placed the euro sign in a gap (position 80&lt;sub&gt;hex&lt;/sub&gt;) in the existing [[C0 and C1 control codes|C1 control codes]].

All of these issues have been resolved as operating systems have been upgraded to support [[Unicode]] as standard, which encodes the euro sign at U+20AC (decimal 8364).

== Comparison table ==
Code points {{U+|0000}} to U+007F are not shown in this table currently, as they are directly mapped in all character sets listed here.  The [[ASCII#ASCII printable characters|ASCII]] coding standard defines the original specification for the mapping of the first 0-127 characters.

The table is arranged by [[Unicode]] code point. Character sets are referred to here by their [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] names in [[upper case]].

&lt;!-- see talk page for code used to generate this table (note: the table has been manually edited since last generation so bear this in mind if you plan to re-generate to say add a new character set.--&gt;

&lt;ref group="nb" name="NB_PCDOS_CP850"&gt;IBM's [[PC&amp;nbsp;DOS 2000]], released in 1998, changed their definition of code page 850 to what they called ''modified code page 850'' now including the euro sign at code point 213 instead of adding support for the new [[code page 858]]. The reason for this might have been down to existing restrictions in the implementation of the codepage switching logic under [[MS-DOS]]/[[PC&amp;nbsp;DOS]], which limited .CPI files to 64&amp;nbsp;KB in size or about six codepages maximum, a limitation, which was circumvented in some OEM versions of MS-DOS, in [[Windows&amp;nbsp;NT]], and also does not exist in [[DR-DOS]].&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="Paul_2001_CPSwitch-64KB-Size"/&gt; --&gt; Further, the parser in MS-DOS/PC&amp;nbsp;DOS limits the number of possible country / codepage entries in [[COUNTRY.SYS]] files to a maximum of 146 or 438, a limitation non-existent in DR-DOS.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="Paul_2001_CPSwitch-438-Entries"/&gt; --&gt; So, adding support for codepage 858 might have meant to drop another (e.g. codepage 850) at the same time, which might not have been a viable solution at that time, given that some applications were hard-wired to use codepage 850.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

&lt;ref name="Paul_2001_CPSwitch-438-Entries"&gt;{{cite web |title=Changing codepages in FreeDOS |author-first=Matthias |author-last=Paul |date=2001-08-15 |access-date=2016-06-06 |url=http://www.freedos.org/technotes/technote/txt/141.txt |type=Technical design specification based on fd-dev post [http://marc.info/?l=freedos-dev&amp;m=99788711909602&amp;w=2&lt;!-- https://archive.is/3yUpW --&gt;] |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606182501/http://www.freedos.org/technotes/technote/txt/141.txt |archive-date=2016-06-06 |quote=The new official ID for the Multilingual "codepage 850 with EURO SIGN" is 858, not 850. IBM will switch to use 858 instead of their 850 variant with future issues of their products. […] I can only guess why they didn't add 858 to their [[EGA.CPI|EGAx.CPI]], [[COUNTRY.SYS]], and [[KEYBOARD.SYS]] files in [[PC&amp;nbsp;DOS&amp;nbsp;2000]]. Many third-party applications are designed to work with 850 and didn't know about 858 at the time PC&amp;nbsp;DOS&amp;nbsp;2000 was released, so it's easier for everyone, but unfortunately it's not compatible.&amp;nbsp;[…] As explained above, COUNTRY.SYS and KEYBOARD.SYS contain only two codepage entries for a given country in Western issues of DOS. (In Arabic and Hebrew issues there can be up to 8 codepages for one country, in theory there is no limit below the range of allowed codepages 1..65534).&amp;nbsp;[…] The problem is that removing support for 850 might have caused compatibility problems with applications which are hard-wired to use 850. Adding 858 as a third choice to all the files would have increased the file and table sizes significantly. The COUNTRY.SYS file parser in MS-DOS/PC&amp;nbsp;DOS [[IO.SYS]]/[[IBMBIO.COM]] sets aside a 6&amp;nbsp;Kb (for DOS&amp;nbsp;6) scratchpad to load all the info. This allows a maximum of 438 entries in a COUNTRY.SYS file to be accepted, otherwise you will get the message "COUNTRY.SYS too large.".

The '''wheel and axle''' are one of six [[simple machine]]s identified by Renaissance scientists drawing from Greek texts on technology.&lt;ref&gt;Wheel and Axle, The World Book Encyclopedia, World Book Inc., 1998, pp. 280-281&lt;/ref&gt; The wheel and axle consists of a [[wheel]] attached to a smaller [[axle]] so that these two parts rotate together in which a force is transferred from one to the other. A [[hinge]] or [[bearing (mechanical)|bearing]] supports the axle, allowing rotation.  It can amplify force; a small force applied to the periphery of the large wheel can move a larger load attached to the axle.

The wheel and axle can be viewed as a version of the [[lever]], with a drive force applied tangentially to the perimeter of the wheel and a load force applied to the axle, respectively, that are balanced around the hinge which is the fulcrum. The [[mechanical advantage]] of the wheel and axle is the ratio of the distances from the fulcrum to the applied loads, or what is the same thing the ratio of the diameter of the wheel and axle.&lt;ref name="Bowser"&gt;Bowser, Edward Albert, 1890, [https://books.google.com/books?id=UdM3AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=wheel+and+axle&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=w_xBTdD9IMzOgAf0tbDVAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CGAQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=wheel%20and%20axle&amp;f=false  An elementary treatise on analytic mechanics: with numerous examples.]   (Originally from the University of Michigan) D. Van Nostrand Company, pp. 190&lt;/ref&gt;  A major application is in [[wheeled vehicle]]s, in which the wheel and axle are used to reduce [[friction]] of the moving vehicle with the ground.  Other examples of devices which use the wheel and axle are [[capstan (nautical)|capstan]]s, [[belt drive]]s and [[gear]]s.

==History==
{{See|Wheel}}

The [[Halaf]] culture of 6500–5100 BCE has been credited with the earliest depiction of a wheeled vehicle, but this is doubtful as there is no evidence of Halafians using either wheeled vehicles or even pottery wheels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=New Light on the Most Ancient East|author=V. Gordon Childe|year=1928|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first applications of the wheel to appear was the [[potter's wheel]], used by prehistoric cultures to fabricate clay pots.  The earliest type, known as "tournettes" or "slow wheels", were known in the [[Middle East]] by the 5th millennium BCE (one of the earliest examples was discovered at Tepe Pardis, [[Iran]], and dated to 5200–4700 BCE). These were made of stone or clay and secured to the ground with a peg in the center, but required effort to turn. True (freely-spinning) wheels were apparently in use in [[Mesopotamia]] by 3500 BCE and possibly as early as 4000 BCE,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Companion to the Archaeology of the Ancient Near East|author=D. T. Potts|year=2012|page=285}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the oldest surviving example, which was found in [[Ur]] (modern day [[Iraq]]), dates to approximately 3100 BCE.

Evidence of wheeled vehicles appears in the second half of the [[4th millennium BCE]], near-simultaneously in [[Mesopotamia]] ([[Sumer]]ian civilization), the Northern [[Caucasus]] ([[Maykop culture]]) and [[Central Europe]] ([[Cucuteni-Trypillian culture]]).

An early well-dated depiction of a [[wheel]]ed vehicle (a wagon—four wheels, two axles) is on the [[Bronocice pot]], a ca. 3635–3370 BCE ceramic vase, excavated in a [[Funnelbeaker culture]] settlement in southern Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Anthony, David A. |title=The horse, the wheel, and language: how Bronze-Age riders from the Eurasian steppes shaped the modern world |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, N.J |year=2007 |page=67 |isbn=0-691-05887-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest known example of a wooden wheel and its axle was found in 2002 at the Ljubljana Marshes some 20&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Ljubljana]], the capital of Slovenia. According to [[radiocarbon dating]], it is between 5,100 and 5,350 years old.  The wheel was made of ash and oak and had a radius of 70&amp;nbsp;cm and the axle was 120&amp;nbsp;cm long and made of oak.&lt;ref name="Slovenia"&gt;{{cite web |title=World's Oldest Wheel Found in Slovenia |url=http://www.ukom.gov.si/en/media_room/background_information/culture/worlds_oldest_wheel_found_in_slovenia/ |date=March 2003 |publisher=Government Communication Office of the Republic of Slovenia |author=Aleksander Gasser |accessdate=19 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Roman Egypt]], [[Hero of Alexandria]] identified the wheel and axle as one of the [[simple machine]]s used to lift weights.&lt;ref name="Usher"&gt;{{cite book

==Mechanical advantage==

The [[simple machine]] called a ''wheel and axle'' refers to the assembly formed by two disks, or cylinders, of different diameters mounted so they rotate together around the same axis.The thin rod which needs to be turned is called the axle and the wider object fixed to the axle, on which we apply force is called the wheel.  A tangential force applied to the periphery of the large disk can exert a larger force on a load attached to the axle, achieving [[mechanical advantage]].  When used as the [[wheel]] of a [[wheeled vehicle]] the smaller cylinder is the axle of the wheel, but when used in a [[windlass]], [[winch]], and other similar applications (see medieval mining lift to right) the smaller cylinder may be separate from the axle mounted in the bearings. It cannot be used separately.&lt;ref&gt;Prater, Edward L. (1994), [http://www.constructionknowledge.net/public_domain_documents/Div_1_General/Basic_Skills/Basic%20Machines%20NAVEDTRA%2014037%201994.pdf Basic Machines], Naval Education and Training Professional Development and Technology Center, NAVEDTRA 14037&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Naval Personnel, 1971, [http://www.webpal.org/SAFE/aaarecovery/5_simple_technology/basic_machines.pdf Basic Machines and How They Work], Dover Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

Assuming the wheel and axle does not dissipate or store energy, that is it has no [[friction]] or [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]], the [[power (physics)|power]] input by the force applied to the wheel must equal the power output at the axle.  As the wheel and axle system rotates around its bearings, points on the circumference, or edge, of the wheel move faster than points on the circumference, or edge, of the axle.  Therefore, a force applied to the edge of the wheel must be less than the force applied to the edge of the axle, because power is the product of force and velocity.&lt;ref&gt;J. J. Uicker, G. R. Pennock, and J. E. Shigley, 2003, '''Theory of Machines and Mechanisms,''' Oxford University Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

Let ''a'' and ''b'' be the distances from the center of the bearing to the edges of the wheel ''A'' and the axle ''B.''   If the input force ''F&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;'' is applied to the edge of the wheel ''A'' and the force ''F&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' at the edge of the axle ''B'' is the output, then the  ratio of the velocities of points ''A'' and ''B'' is given by ''a/b'', so  the ratio of the output force to the input force, or [[mechanical advantage]], is given by
:&lt;math&gt;MA = \frac{F_B}{F_A} = \frac{a}{b}.&lt;/math&gt;

The mechanical advantage of a simple machine like the wheel and axle is computed as the ratio of the resistance to the effort. The larger the ratio the greater the multiplication of force (torque) created or distance achieved. By varying the radii of the axle and/or wheel, any amount of mechanical advantage may be gained.&lt;ref name="Bowser"/&gt;  In this manner, the size of the wheel may be increased to an inconvenient extent.  In this case a system or combination of wheels (often toothed, that is, [[gear]]s) are used.  As a wheel and axle is a type of lever, a system of wheels and axles is like a compound lever.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, C.E.  The Principles and Practice of Statics and Dynamics … for the Use of Schools and Private Students.  London: John Weale, 59, High Holborn. 1851 pp. 26-29 [https://books.google.com/books?id=8zQDAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=%22wheel+and+axle%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=iAgpTbOVDZKqngeK8r2xAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22wheel%20and%20axle%22&amp;f=false read online or download full text]
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ideal mechanical advantage===
The mechanical advantage of a wheel and axle with no [[friction]] is called the [[ideal mechanical advantage]] (IMA).  It is calculated with the following formula:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{IMA} = {F_\text{out} \over F_\text{in}} = { \mathrm{Radius}_\text{wheel} \over \mathrm{Radius}_\text{axle}} &lt;/math&gt;

===Actual mechanical advantage===
All actual wheels have friction, which dissipates some of the power as heat.  The [[actual mechanical advantage]] (AMA) of a wheel and axle is calculated with the following formula:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{AMA} = {F_\text{out} \over F_\text{in}} =  \eta \cdot { \mathrm{Radius}_\text{wheel} \over \mathrm{Radius}_\text{axle}} &lt;/math&gt;

where 
:&lt;math&gt;\eta = {P_\text{out} \over P_\text{in} }&lt;/math&gt; is the efficiency of the wheel, the ratio of power output to power input
