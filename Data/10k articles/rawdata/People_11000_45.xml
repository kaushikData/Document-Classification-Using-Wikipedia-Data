{{Book of Mormon}}
[[File:Alma-the-Elder(BoM).jpg|thumb|The illustration called "Alma Baptizing in the [[Waters of Mormon]]" was published in the book called ''Cities in the Sun'', published by Elizabeth Rachel Cannon in 1910.]]
According to the [[Book of Mormon]], '''Alma''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|l|m|ə}}) was a [[Nephite]] prophet  who established the Church of [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]] [[Christ (title)|Christ]] in the Americas during the reign of the wicked [[King Noah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=L. Gary Lambert |url=http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/publications/books/?bookid=51&amp;chapid=337 |title=To All the World: The Book of Mormon Articles from the Encyclopedia of Mormonism - Alma1 |publisher=Maxwellinstitute.byu.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the Book of Mormon's greatest figures, he is sometimes referred to as "Alma the Elder" as seen on the website of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/scriptures/gs/alma-the-elder?lang=eng |title=Alma the Elder |publisher=Lds.org |date=2012-02-21 |accessdate=2013-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; to avoid confusion with his son, also named Alma, who is often called "[[Alma the Younger]]."  It is believed that he was born in roughly 174 BC. and his son Alma the Younger was born in roughly 126 BC.

==Narrative==

===Alma's conversion===
While a young man, Alma was one of several corrupt priests who served [[King Noah]] in the [[land of Nephi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Bassett |first=Arthur R. |url=http://www.lds.org/ensign/1977/02/alma-the-elder |title=Alma the Elder |magazine=[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] |date=February 1977 |accessdate=2013-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  About 148 BC, a prophet named [[Abinadi]] was arrested for preaching repentance and condemning the wickedness of Noah and his people.  Brought before the king and his priests, Abinadi emphatically urged them to repent and obey the gospel of Jesus Christ.  Of all who heard him, only Alma was touched by Abinadi's words.  When Alma began to defend Abinadi the king had Alma cast out and Abinadi burned alive.  Fleeing for his life, Alma went into hiding and wrote down what Abinadi had said before the court.  Alma began to preach the gospel in secret, emphasizing Abinadi's teachings "concerning that which was to come, and also concerning the resurrection of the dead, and the redemption of the people, which was to be brought to pass through the power, and sufferings, and death of Christ, and his resurrection and ascension into heaven" ({{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Mosiah|chapter=18|verse=2}}).

===Alma's followers===

At a hidden retreat in the wilderness called the [[waters of Mormon]], Alma baptized his listeners and organized the church of Christ among them.  In time, King Noah found out where Alma's congregation was meeting, and, fearing insurrection, sent his army to destroy them.  Being warned by God of the army's coming, Alma quickly led his band of approximately 450 converts into the wilderness for eight days, finally stopping in an uninhabited land which they named Helam.  The people of Alma established the city of Helam there and prospered for many years, remaining faithful to God's commandments.

===Return to Zarahemla===
As the years passed, Alma and his people were discovered by the [[Lamanite]]s and enslaved, placed under the authority of [[Amulon]]—a former priest of King Noah now united with the Lamanites—who began to persecute Alma’s people, “put[ting] tasks upon them, and put[ting] task-masters over them” ({{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Mosiah|chapter=24|verse=9}}).  Finally, in about 120 BC, Alma's people escaped the Lamanites and were led by God through the wilderness for twelve days until they arrived in the land of [[Zarahemla]], then the chief Nephite population center.  The people of Alma joyfully united with the Nephites and helped to strengthen the church of Christ in Zarahemla.  Zarahemla's King [[King Mosiah I|Mosiah]] soon authorized Alma to serve as the first high priest over the Church in Zarahemla.  Alma continued in this capacity for many years.

When Alma's son, [[Alma the Younger]], and the four [[Sons of Mosiah|sons of King Mosiah]] came of age they rebelled against the church and "were numbered among the unbelievers" ({{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Mosiah|chapter=27|verse=8}}).  However, as they went about to destroy the church an angel appeared and, in an experience similar to that of Saul on the road to Damascus, they were all converted.  Like Saul, their subsequent efforts on behalf of the church overshadowed their previous efforts to destroy the church.  Shortly before his death, Alma conferred the office of high priest upon his son.

The Book of Mormon states that Alma the Elder "lived to fulfil the commandments of God" ({{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Mosiah|chapter=29|verse=45}}).  He died in about 91 BC.

==Descendants==
Alma had several notable descendants in the Book of Mormon narrative as shown in the family tree below:

== Name ==
At the time Joseph Smith dictated the Book of Mormon, Alma was known only as a woman's name. Recent historical research indicates it may have been a masculine name among Jewish people around 600 B.C., which is the time Lehi left Jerusalem according to the Book of Mormon.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul Y. Hoskisson |url=http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/publications/jbms/?vol=7&amp;num=1&amp;id=173 |title=What's in a Name? Alma as a Hebrew Name - Paul Y. Hoskisson - Journal of Book of Mormon Studies - Volume 7 - Issue 1 |publisher=Maxwellinstitute.byu.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A potential Hebrew meaning of the name may be "lad of God" and “He [God] is bound.” Alma may possibly be traced to the Arabic root ''‘alama/’ ‘alima,'' suggesting “knowing, erudite; distinguished; chief, chieftain."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Image:Zuster augustinesse in de Warmoesstraat Amsterdam 20070427.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Augustinain nun in the [[Warmoesstraat]] [[Amsterdam]]]]
'''Augustinian [[nuns]]''' are the most ancient and continuous segment of the Roman Catholic  [[Augustinians|Augustinian religious order]] under the canons of contemporary [[historical method]]. The Augustinian nuns, named after [[Saint]] [[Augustine of Hippo]] (died AD 430), are several Roman Catholic [[Enclosed religious orders|enclosed]] [[monastic order]]s  of women living according to a guide to religious life known as the [[Augustinians#The Augustinian Rule|Rule of St. Augustine]]. Prominent Augustinian nuns include Italian composer [[Vittoria Aleotti]], Italian mystic [[St. Clare of Montefalco]], [[German mystic]] [[Anne Catherine Emmerich]] and St. [[Rita of Cascia]].

==Origins==

Though [[Augustine of Hippo]] probably  didn't compose a formal monastic rule (despite the extant Augustinian Rule),&lt;ref name="The Rule"&gt;Augustine of Hippo The Rule of St Augustine Constitutiones Ordinis Fratrum S. Augustini (Rome 1968)&lt;/ref&gt; his hortatory letter to the nuns at Hippo Regius (''Epist''., ccxi, Benedictine ed.) is the most ancient example on which the beginnings of this [[Augustinian Rule]] are based.

The nuns regard as their first foundation the monastery for which St. Augustine wrote the rules of life in his Epistola ccxi (alias cix) in 423. It is certain that this epistle was called the Rule of St. Augustine for nuns at an early date, and has been followed as the rule of life in many female monasteries since the 11th century. These monasteries were not consolidated in 1256, like the religious communities of Augustinian monks.
 
Each convent was independent and was not subject to the general of the order. This led to differences in rule, dress, and mode of life. Only since the 15th century have certain [[Augustinian Hermits]] reformed a number of Augustinian nunneries, become their spiritual directors, and induced them to adopt the Constitution of their order. Henceforth, there were female members of the Order of Hermits of St. Augustine in Italy, France, Spain, Belgium and later in Germany, where, however, many were suppressed during the Reformation, or by the secularizing law of 1803. In the other countries many nunneries were closed in consequence of the [[French Revolution]]. The still existing houses in the early 20th century, except [[Cascia]], Renteria ([[Diocese of Vitoria]]), Eibar (Diocese of Vittoria) and Cracow, were under the jurisdiction of the bishop of the diocese. Many convents are celebrated for the saints whom they produced, such as [[Montefalco]] in Central Italy, the home of [[St. Clare of the Cross]] (or St. Clara of Montefalco, d. 1308), and [[Cascia]], near [[Perugia]], where [[St. Rita]] died in 1457. In the suppressed German convent of [[Agnetenberg]] near [[Dülmen]], in [[Westphalia]], lived [[Anne Catherine Emmerich]] celebrated for her visions.

Mention should also be made of the monastery of the so-called '''Augustinians delle Vergini''', at [[Venice]], founded in 1177 by [[pope Alexander III]] after his reconciliation with Holy Roma Emperor [[Frederick Barbarossa]], whose daughter Julia, with twelve girls of noble birth, entered the monastery and became first abbess. [[Doge of Venice|Doge]] [[Sebastiano Zani]], who had endowed the institution, was appointed [[patron]], with the privilege of approving the election of the abbess before the granting of the papal confirmation. On the French occupation in the 18th century the religious went to America, where they devoted themselves to the work of teaching and the care of the sick. Later they established monasteries in Italy and in 1817 in Paris. Towards the end of the 16th century communities of female Discalced Augustinians appeared in Spain. The first convent, that of the Visitation, was founded at Madrid, in 1589, by Prudencia Grillo, a lady of noble birth, and received its Constitution from Father Alfonso of Orozco. Juan de Ribera, Archbishop of Valencia (d. 1611), founded a second Discalced Augustinian congregation at [[Alcoy, Spain|Alcoy]], in 1597. It soon had houses in different parts of Spain, and in 1663 was established at Lisbon by Queen Louise of Portugal. In addition to the Rule of St. Augustine these religious observed the exercises of the Reformed Carmelites of St. Teresa. In the convent at Cybar, Mariana Manzanedo of St. Joseph instituted a reform which led to the establishment of a third, that of the female Augustinian Recollects. The statutes, drawn up by Father Antinólez, and later confirmed by Paul V, bound the sisters to the strictest interpretation of the rules of poverty and obedience, and a rigorous penitential discipline. All three reforms spread in Spain and Portugal, but not in other countries.

A congregation of Augustinian nuns under the title "Sisters of St. Ignatius" was introduced into the Philippines and South America by the Discalced Augustinian Hermits. They worked zealously in aid of the missions, schools and orphanages in the island, and founded the colleges of Our Lady of Consolation and of St. Anne at Manila, and houses at Neuva [[Segovia]], Cebú and [[Mandaloya]] on the [[Pasig]], where they have done much for the [[education of girls]].

Historically, the  most important of the observant Augustinian congregations were the Spanish Augustinian tertiary nuns, founded in 1545 by Archbishop [[Thomas of Villanova]] at [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]]; the "reformed" Augustinian nuns who originated under the influence of Augustinian educated [[Carmelite]] [[Teresa of Ávila|St Theresa]] after the end of the 16th century at [[Madrid]], [[Alcoi|Alcoy]], and those founded in [[Portugal]].

==The Augustinian Ethos==
The teaching and writing of Augustine, the [[Augustinians#The Augustinian Rule|Augustinian Rule]], and the lives and experiences of Augustinians over sixteen centuries help define the ethos of the order, sometimes "honoured in the breach".

As well as telling his disciples to be "of one mind and heart on the way towards God"&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo  The Rule of St Augustine Constitutiones Ordinis Fratrum S. Augustini (Rome 1968) Chapter I&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine of Hippo taught that "Nothing conquers except truth and the victory of truth is love" (''Victoria veritatis est caritas''),&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo Sermons 358,1 "Victoria veritatis est caritas"&lt;/ref&gt; and the pursuit of truth through learning is key to the Augustinian ethos, balanced by the injunction to behave with love towards one another. It does not unduly single out the exceptional, especially favour the gifted, nor exclude the poor or marginalised. Love is not earned through human merit, but received and given freely by God's free gift of grace, totally undeserved yet generously given. These same imperatives of affection and fairness have driven the order in its international missionary outreach. This balanced pursuit of love and learning has energised the various branches of the order into building communities founded on mutual affection and intellectual advancement. The Augustinian ideal is inclusive.

Augustine spoke passionately of God's "beauty so ancient and so new",&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo Confessions 10, 27&lt;/ref&gt; and his fascination with beauty extended to music.  He taught that "to sing once is to pray twice" (''Qui cantat, bis orat''),&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo Sermons 336, 1 PL 38, 1472&lt;/ref&gt; and music is also a key part of the Augustinian ethos. Besides the significant musical contribution of Augustinian nun and composer [[Vittoria Aleotti]], contemporary Augustinian musical foundations include the famous [[Augustinian Church, Vienna|Augustinerkirche]] of the (male) friars in Vienna, where orchestral masses by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]] are performed every week, as well as the [https://web.archive.org/web/20061218130318/http://www.florianer.at/site_en/ boys' choir] at [[Sankt Florian]] in Austria, a school conducted by [[Canons Regular]], a choir now over 1,000 years old.

==Augustinian Congregations==
Other orders and groups of women that are not [[Enclosed religious orders|enclosed]] and belong within the Augustinian family either because they follow the Rule of Augustine or have been formally aggregated through their constitutions into the worldwide Augustinian Order are: 
The [[Sisters of St Rita]], The [[Augustinian Sisters of Mercy of Jesus]] (South Africa), the [[Augustinian Recollects]] and the [[Sisters of Our Lady of Consolation]] (both in the Philippines), the [[Congregation of Our Lady of the Missions]], the [[Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word]]&lt;ref&gt;c.f. The Rule of Saint Augustine and the Constitutions of the Order of the Incarnate Word and Blessed Sacrament  New York: Schwartz, Kirwin, and Fauss, 1893, pp. 33–35.&lt;/ref&gt; (who established the [[University of the Incarnate Word]] in Texas), and the [[Sisters of St Joan of Arc]] (in Quebec, United States, and Rome) are just some of the Augustinian family of orders who are not [[Enclosed religious orders|enclosed]] women. The [[Sisters of Life]] are a relatively new order (founded 1991 by [[Cardinal O'Connor]]) who follow the Augustinian rule.

There are other [[Augustinian nuns in the Anglican Communion]].

'''Myra Maybelle Shirley Reed Starr''' (February 5, 1848&amp;nbsp;– February 3, 1889), better known as '''Belle Starr''', was a notorious American [[outlaw]].

Belle associated with the [[James–Younger Gang]] and other outlaws. She was convicted of horse theft in 1883. She was fatally shot in 1889 in a case that is still officially unsolved. Her story was popularized by Richard K. Fox—editor and publisher of the ''[[National Police Gazette]]''—and she later became a popular character in television and movies.

==Early life==
Belle Starr was born Myra Maybelle Shirley on her father's farm near [[Carthage, Missouri]], on February 5, 1848. Most of her family members called her May. Her father, John Shirley, prospered raising wheat, corn, hogs and horses, though he was considered to be the "[[black sheep]]" of a well-to-do Virginia family which had moved west to Indiana, where he married and divorced twice.&lt;ref&gt;[Shirley, Glenn. ''Belle Starr and Her Times: The Literature, the Facts and the Legends''. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1982, pp 31–65]&lt;/ref&gt;  Her mother, Elizabeth "Eliza" Hatfield Shirley, was John Shirley's third wife and a distant relative to the Hatfields of the [[Hatfield–McCoy feud|famous family feud]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Shirley, Glenn. Belle Starr and Her Times: The Literature, the Facts and the Legends. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1982, p 34]]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1860s, her father sold the farm and moved the family to Carthage, where he bought an [[Public house#Inns|inn]], [[livery stable]] and blacksmith shop on the [[town square]].

May Shirley received a classical education and learned piano, while graduating from Missouri's Carthage Female Academy, a private institution that her father had helped to found.&lt;ref name=Rasmussen&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/feb/17/local/me-then17|author=Cecilia Rasmussen|date=February 17, 2002|title= L.A. Then and Now: Truth Dims the Legend of Outlaw Queen Belle Starr|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==During the Civil War==
After a [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] attack on Carthage in 1864, the Shirleys moved to [[Scyene, Texas]]. According to legend, it was at Scyene that the Shirleys became associated with a number of Missouri-born criminals, including [[Jesse James]] and the Youngers. In fact, she knew the [[James-Younger Gang|Younger brothers]] and the James boys because she had grown up with them in Missouri. Her brother, John A. M. "Bud" Shirley, was called Captain Shirley by local Confederate sympathizers. He does not appear on any list of Quantrill's Raiders, but rode with a group who were called [[partisan (military)|partisan]]s by some and [[bushwackers]] by Union sympathizers.  Bud Shirley was killed in 1864 in [[Sarcoxie, Missouri]], while he and another scout were eating at the home of a Confederate sympathizer. Union troops surrounded the house and when Bud attempted to escape, he was shot and killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Janet Ariciu family Bush |author=Janet Ariciu |url=http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=monkeys&amp;id=I61536 |publisher=RootsWeb – an [[Ancestry.com]] community |date=1 February 2013 |accessdate=2013-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==After the Civil War==
[[File:Jim Reed and Belle Starr.jpg|thumb|[[Jim Reed (outlaw)|Jim Reed]] and Belle Starr in 1866]]

Following the war, the Reed family also moved to Scyene and May Shirley married [[Jim Reed (outlaw)|Jim Reed]] in 1866, after having had an earlier crush on him as a teen. Two years later, she gave birth to her first child, Rosie Lee (nicknamed Pearl). Belle always harbored a strong sense of style, which would feed into her later legend. A crack shot, she used to ride [[sidesaddle]] while dressed in a black velvet riding habit and a plumed hat, carrying two pistols, with cartridge belts across her hips.&lt;ref name=Rasmussen/&gt; Jim turned to crime and was wanted for murder in [[Arkansas]], which caused the family to move to California, where their second child, James Edwin (Eddie), was born in 1871.

Later returning to Texas, Jim Reed was involved with several criminal gangs. While Jim initially tried his hand at farming, he would grow restless and fell in with bad company—the Starr clan, a [[Cherokee]] Indian family notorious for whiskey, cattle, and horse thievery in the Indian Territory (now Oklahoma), as well as his wife's old friends the James and Younger gangs. In April 1874, despite a lack of any evidence, a [[Warrant (law)|warrant]] was issued for her arrest for a [[stagecoach]] robbery by her husband and others. Jim Reed was killed in August of that year in [[Paris, Texas]], where he had settled down with his family.

==Marriage to Sam Starr==
[[File:Belle Starr, Fort Smith, Arkansas, 1886.jpg|thumb|left|Belle Starr, Fort Smith, Arkansas, 1886]]

Allegedly, Belle was briefly married for three weeks to Charles Younger, uncle of Cole Younger in 1878, but this is not substantiated by any evidence.  There are numerous claims that Belle's daughter Pearl Reed was actually Pearl Younger, but in Cole Younger's own biography (quoted in Glen Shirley's "Belle Starr and her times") Cole Younger discounted that as rubbish and set down what he truly knew of Belle. In 1880 she did marry a Cherokee man named Sam Starr and settled with the Starr family in the [[Indian Territory]]. There, she learned ways of organizing, planning and fencing for the rustlers, horse thieves and bootleggers, as well as harboring them from the law. Belle's illegal enterprises proved lucrative enough for her to employ bribery to free her cohorts from the law whenever they were caught.

In 1883, Belle and Sam were arrested by [[Bass Reeves]] charged with [[horse theft]] and tried before [[Isaac Parker|"The Hanging Judge" Isaac Parker]]'s [[United States Federal Court|Federal District Court]] in [[Fort Smith, Arkansas]];  the prosecutor was United States Attorney [[W. H. H. Clayton]].  She was found guilty and served nine months at the [[Detroit House of Corrections]] in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]]. Belle proved to be a model prisoner and during her time in jail she won the respect of the prison matron, while Sam was more incorrigible and was assigned to hard labor.

In 1886, she escaped [[conviction (law)|conviction]] on another theft charge, but on December 17, Sam Starr was involved in a gunfight with Officer Frank West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odmp.org/officer/14019-police-officer-frank-west|author=|date=|title=Police Officer Frank West, United States Department of the Interior - Bureau of Indian Affairs - Division of Law Enforcement, U.S. Government|publisher=Officer Down Memorial Page|accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both men were killed, while Belle's life as an outlaw queen—and what had been the happiest relationship of her life—abruptly ended with her husband's death.

==Unsolved murder==
[[File:Belle Starr and Blue Duck.jpg|thumb| Blue Duck and Belle Starr, May 24, 1886.]]

For the last two-plus years of her life, gossips and scandal sheets linked her to a series of men with colorful names, including Jack Spaniard, Jim French and [[Blue Duck (outlaw)|Blue Duck]], after which, in order to keep her [[Home|residence]] on Indian land, she married a relative of Sam Starr, Jim July Starr, who was some 15 years younger than she was.

On February 3, 1889, two days before her 41st birthday, she was killed. She was riding home from a neighbor's house in [[Eufaula, Oklahoma]], when she was ambushed. After she fell off her horse, she was shot again to make sure she was dead. Her death resulted from [[shotgun]] wounds to the back and neck and in the shoulder and face. Legend says she was shot with her own double barrel shotgun.&lt;ref name=Rasmussen/&gt;

According to [[Frank Eaton|Frank "Pistol Pete" Eaton]], her death was due to different circumstances. She had been attending a dance. Frank Eaton had been the last person to dance with Belle Starr when Edgar Watson, clearly intoxicated had asked to dance with her. When Belle Starr declined, he later followed her. When on the way home, she stopped to give her horse a drink at a creek, he shot and killed her. According to Frank Eaton, Watson was tried, convicted and executed by hanging for the murder.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oklahomaterritory.org{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, another story says there were no witnesses and no one was ever convicted of the murder. Suspects with apparent motive included her new husband and both of her children, as well as [[Chokoloskee, Florida#Edgar Watson|Edgar J. Watson]], one of her [[sharecroppers]], because he was afraid she was going to turn him in to the [[authorities]] as an escaped murderer from Florida with a price on his head. Watson, who was killed in 1910, was tried for her murder, but was acquitted, and the ambush has entered Western lore as "[[Cold case (criminology)|unsolved]]".

One source suggests her son, whom she had allegedly beaten for mistreating her horse, may have been her killer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontiertimes.com/outlaws/belle_starr.html|title=FrontierTimes - Outlaws - Belle Starr|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story becomes popularized==
[[File:Woolaroc - Belle Star 2.jpg|thumb|Statue of Belle Starr at [[Woolaroc]] in [[Oklahoma]]]]

Although an obscure figure outside Texas throughout most of her life, Belle's story was picked up by the [[dime novel]] and ''[[National Police Gazette]]'' publisher, Richard K. Fox. Fox made her name famous with his novel ''Bella Starr, the Bandit Queen, or the Female Jesse James'', published in 1889 (the year of her murder). This novel is still often cited as a historical reference.  It was the first of many popular stories that used her name.

==Children==
Belle's son, Eddie Reed, was convicted of horse theft and [[receiving stolen property]] in July 1889. Judge Parker sent him to prison in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. Belle's daughter, Rosie Reed, also known as [[Pearl Starr]], became a prostitute to raise funds for Eddie's release. She did eventually obtain a [[Pardon|presidential pardon]] in 1893. Ironically, Eddie became a deputy in Fort Smith and&lt;ref name="chroniclingamerica.loc.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83025010/1896-12-17/ed-1/seq-2/;words=Ed+Reed?date1=1896&amp;rows=20&amp;searchType=basic&amp;state=&amp;date2=1896&amp;proxtext=Ed+Reed&amp;y=6&amp;x=21&amp;dateFilterType=yearRange&amp;index=0|title=Indian chieftain.

==Early life and education==

Carolyn Beatrice Parker was born in [[Gainesville, Florida]] on November 18, 1917.&lt;ref name="Who's Who" /&gt; Her father was Julius A. Parker, a physician who according to the family, was a student of John Kenneth Galbraith, and the second African-American to receive a PhD in business from Harvard.&lt;ref name="Warren" /&gt; Her mother was Della Ella Murrell Parker.&lt;ref name="Who's Who" /&gt; Della Parker was a sister of [[Joan Murrell Owens]], a marine biologist who was one of the first African-American women to receive a PhD in geology.&lt;ref name="Kessler"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kessler|first1=James H.|title=Distinguished African American scientists of the 20th century|date=1996|publisher=Oryx Press|location=Phoenix, Ariz.|isbn=978-0-89774-955-8|edition=[Online-Ausg.].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carolyn Parker was one of six children, all but one of whom received natural science or mathematics degrees. Mary Parker Miller had a Masters of Science in mathematics from [[New York University]] in 1975; Juanita Parker Wynter had a Bachelor of Science in mathematics and chemistry, and a Master of Science from [[New York University]]; Julie Leslie Parker had a Bachelor of Science in mathematics from [[Fisk University]] and a master's degree in medical technology from [[Meharry Medical College]]; and Julius Parker Jr had a master's degree in chemistry from the [[University of Michigan]]. The sixth sibling, Martha Parker, studied social sciences, gaining a master's degree from [[Temple University]].&lt;ref name="Warren" /&gt;

Carolyn Parker graduated magna cum laude with an A.B. (Bachelor of Arts) degree from Fisk University in 1938, then an A.M. (Master of Arts) in mathematics from the [[University of Michigan]] in 1941.&lt;ref name="Who's Who" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BoR Uni of Michigan"&gt;{{cite book|title=Proceedings of the Board of Regents August 1939 – May 1942|publisher=University of Michigan|location=Ann Arbor, Michigan|page=640|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015051325739;view=1up;seq=1|accessdate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She undertook further studies from 1946–1947 at [[Ohio State University]], towards the end of time of her time on the Dayton Project.&lt;ref name="Who's Who" /&gt; She gained a Master's in physics from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) in 1951,.&lt;ref name="Warren" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MIT"&gt;{{cite book|title=Abstracts of theses accepted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Degrees of Doctor of Philosophy and Doctor of Science.|date=1951|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)|location=Boston|page=208|url=https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/002134746|accessdate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parker's family report that she had completed the course work for her PhD in physics at MIT around 1952 or 1953, but leukemia prevented her from defending her dissertation.&lt;ref name="Warren" /&gt; She is the first African-American woman known to have gained a postgraduate degree in physics.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==Career==

Parker taught in public schools in [[Rochelle, Florida]] from 1938–1939, [[Gainesville, Florida]] from 1939–1940, and [[Newport News, Virginia]] from 1941–1942.&lt;ref name="Who's Who" /&gt; She was an instructor in physics and mathematics at [[Bluefield State College]] from 1942–1943.&lt;ref name="Who's Who" /&gt;
From 1943 to 1947, Parker was a research physicist on the [[Dayton Project]], at the [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]] in Dayton, Ohio.&lt;ref name="Who's Who" /&gt; The Dayton Project was part of the [[Manhattan Project]] to develop atomic weapons in World War II, and continuing into the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref name="Dayton Project"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dayton, OH|url=http://www.atomicheritage.org/location/dayton-oh|website=Atomic Heritage Foundation|publisher=Atomic Heritage Foundation|accessdate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Monsanto Chemical Company]] led top-secret research work on using polonium as the initiator for atomic explosions.&lt;ref name="Dayton Project" /&gt; 
Parker's sister, Juanita Parker Wynter, reported in an interview that her work there was "so secret she couldn't discuss it, even with us, her family".&lt;ref name="Warren" /&gt;

In 1947, Parker became an assistant professor of physics at [[Fisk University]] in Tennessee.&lt;ref name="Who's Who" /&gt;

Parker was a member of the [[Institute of Radio Engineers]], the [[American Physical Society]], Sigma Upsilon Pi, and [[Delta Sigma Theta]].&lt;ref name="Who's Who" /&gt;

'''''Cheeki Rafiki''''' was a [[Beneteau|Bénéteau]] First 40.7 [[sailboat|sailing yacht]]. Her sinking on May 16, 2014 resulted in an extended debate over the safety of modern sailing boats. The yacht lost her keel about 720 nautical miles Southeast of Nova Scotia and subsequently capsized. Rescue services found her upturned hull before it sank but the crew – four English men – was never found.

== The yacht ==
''Cheeki Rafiki'' was a Bénéteau First 40.7, which had been built 2006 in Bénéteau's shipyard in [[Saint-Hilaire-de-Riez]], [[France]]. She was about 12 meters long. She had been delivered to the customer in December 2006, who planned to enter her in charter regattas around Great Britain. In 2011, Stormforce Coaching took over the management of the yacht, but not her ownership. Subsequently, they entered the yacht twice for the [[Atlantic Rally for Cruisers]] (ARC), in the autumns of 2011 and 2013. After each of these crossings, she stayed in the [[Caribbean|Caribbean Sea]] for a few months. The tragedy happened during the journey home in early 2014.&lt;ref name="maib"/&gt; 

Central to the later investigation was the construction of the hull and especially the link between the hull and the so-called "matrix", an inner layer that was embedded in the lower part of the hull to give it the necessary stability and stiffness. The keel was secured to the hull by ten bolts; nine of them 24mm in diameter and one 14mm. They were laminated into the keel, and put through the outer hull, the matrix, and a steel [[Washer (hardware)|washer]], and then secured with nuts. The building process and the construction fulfilled the CE-seaworthiness Classification of category A (ocean), in the version valid at the time of building. Additionally, the construction process had been surveyed by [[Bureau Veritas]].

[[File:Cheeki_Rafiki_is_examined_by_Diver.png|thumb|''[[USS Oscar Austin]]'' sends a diver to the upturned hull of ''Cheeki Rafiki'']]
''Cheeki Rafiki'' had participated in the [[Antigua Sailing Week]] event in spring 2014 and was supposed to return to [[Southampton]], England afterwards, to be available as charter yacht the following season. She left [[Antigua]] on May, 4 with a crew of four men on board. The voyage was expected to take about 30 days. During the voyage, the [[Sea captain#Skipper|skipper]] exchanged E-Mails with the director of Stormforce over [[satellite phone]], especially about route suggestions and weather reports. Initially, there was not much wind, but it was constantly increasing after May 10. On May 16, the wind blew with [[Beaufort scale|Force 7]] and a considerable [[Sea state|sea]] had built up. The skipper reported to shore that the ship was taking on significant amounts of water for no apparent reason. A later phone call was incomprehensible, such that the director called [[Her Majesty's Coastguard|MRCC Falmouth]] for help. A [[search-and-rescue]] operation was started. RCC [[Boston]], responsible for the area in question, sent out a [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|HC-130]] Long Range Surveillance Aircraft. They were looking for a disabled yacht and persons in the water, since two [[Personal Locator Beacon|PLB]] devices had sent emergency signals. The aircraft crew identified only debris at the expected position.&lt;ref name="maib"/&gt;  

On May 17, more than 24 hours after the last contact with the ship, the [[Container ship|container vessel]] ''Maersk Kure'' identified ''Cheeki Rafiki''{{'}}s hull, upside-down. The [[keel]] was missing, but the [[rudder]] was still in place. Due to bad weather conditions, the wreck could not be investigated further. Only about one week later could a ship of the US Navy send a diver to the still-floating wreck. This confirmed the [[life raft]] was still secured to its storage location; the crew had not had the time to bring it out. Consequently, the search was terminated, because any hope of finding the crew alive was in vain. The maximum time somebody can survive in water of 16 °C is about 15.5 hours.&lt;ref&gt;According to an estimate of RCC Boston, see MAIB-Report, Page 13&lt;/ref&gt;

== Investigation ==
The accident resulted in heated discussion amongst yachtsmen over the safety of sailboats and particularly over the construction and dimensioning of the connection between keel and hull, which had obviously failed in this case, but is of utmost importance for a sailing vessel. There were speculations whether the shipyard had fallen below the margins for required hull stability to cut costs as a measure to win customers in the highly competitive market for affordable yachts.&lt;ref name="morganscloud1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.morganscloud.com/2015/06/25/cheeki-rafiki-report-misses-an-opportunity-to-make-boats-safer/|title=Report Misses An Opportunity to Make Boats Safer|date=2016-06-29|access-date=2016-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report of the British [[Marine Accident Investigation Branch]] showed that the construction did satisfy the relevant construction specifications available at the time of construction. It even almost passed the revised ones at the time of the accident. Therefore, the shipyard could not be held liable for the lack of stability.&lt;ref name="maib"/&gt;  

Furthermore, the crew could also not be blamed for the accident, because they were competent and the skipper was in the possession of all required certificates for such a voyage. At the time of the accident, the wind blew with [[Beaufort scale|force 7]], which is rough but still completely within the limits for which such boats  are constructed. The accident investigation report points out though, that it's unclear whether the ship was even allowed to set to sea under applicable laws. This because, as a professionally skippered boat, there are extensive rules concerning equipment, crewing and yearly safety inspections. The later was overdue, but the operator was intending to postpone the inspection until the boat was back in England, so that he could avoid the costs of having to fly an inspector to the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]].&lt;ref name="maib"/&gt; 
[[File:Cheeki_Rafiki's_upturned_hull.png|thumb|Close up picture of ''Cheeki Rafiki''{{'}}s hull, where the keel had been. It is visible that the inner hull has separated from the outer and that the screws including the washers are completely missing.]]

The investigation report then tries to evaluate why the keel actually separated, even though technically, computationally and based on the weather at the place of incident there was no obvious reason for this. The wreck of the ''Cheeki Rafiki'' was not available for investigation, as it has not been found yet. So the MAIB had to find their conclusions from the few pictures of the rescue crews, the history of the boat and reports from sister ships. It was known that she had had a few [[Ship grounding|groundings]] prior to the accident – experts investigated by the MAIB said that this was not uncommon for ships participating in races. The connection between hull, matrix and keel had been repaired several times already. Even experts are not normally capable of telling how such a repair would be properly done and how to tell that it was acceptably fixed. The recommendation from the manufacturer to remove the keel completely was considered best practice, its cost-effectiveness was questioned though.&lt;ref name="maib"&gt;Report on the investigation of the loss of the yacht Cheeki Rafiki and its four crew in the Atlantic Ocean, Report 8/2015 [https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/media/55408664e5274a157200005b/MAIBInvReport_8_2015.pdf Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

The report concludes that the most probable cause for the accident was a failure of the glued link between the  "matrix" (inner skeleton) and the outer hull. Similar damages could be observed in sister ships which where involved in groundings, too. Different repair yards said that they could only hardly determine the severity of such damages. Also, a skipper cannot easily determine whether a "light" grounding had caused any damage. The report states that ''Almost all [yacht owners and professional yacht skippers asked] agreed that groundings can occur when racing, and that if, in their opinion, it was a ‘light’ grounding, no inspection for damage was necessary''&lt;ref name="ground"/&gt;, while at the same time, there are several definitions for a ''light grounding'':
* a grounding where the vessel did not stop;
* where the vessel only ‘bounced’ over the bottom;

* where the vessel grounded at slow speed; and
* where the vessel grounded on a soft bottom e.g. sand.&lt;ref name="ground"&gt;MAIB-Report, Page 28&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is assumed that the structural damages in the hull of ''Cheeki Rafiki'' had not been sufficiently repaired after the previous groundings, such that the stability of the glued hull was compromised. It couldn't withstand the force of the increasing waves. The pictures show that the layers of the hull had separated. Some bolts could also have failed due to [[corrosion]]. 

The extensive report gives many recommendations for improvements. However, it does not ask for increased stability requirements for keel-to-hull constructions.&lt;ref name="morganscloud1"/&gt;

Shortly after the report was published operating company Stormforce and its director Douglas Innes were charged, with Innes facing four counts of [[Manslaughter in English law|manslaughter by gross negligence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/07/cheeki-rafiki-yacht-douglas-innes-charged-manslaughter-deaths|title=Yacht firm boss charged with manslaughter over Cheeki Rafiki deaths|date=2016-10-07|publisher=The Guardian|access-date=2016-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/07/manslaughter-charges-brought-over-the-death-of-four-sailors-in-c/|title=Manslaughter charges brought over the death of four sailors in Cheeki Rafiki yacht tragedy|date=2016-10-07|publisher=The Telegraph|access-date=2016-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was accused of insufficient maintenance to cut costs. The yacht was, according to the [[Crown Prosecution Service]], not [[Seaworthiness (law)|seaworthy]] for an ocean passage, as several bolts of the keel were corroded or broken even before the voyage: "A number of keel bolts had broken, causing it to detach from the hull. Many were broken and it had been like that for months. The yacht was therefore unsound, broken, and unsafe before the men left from Antigua."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yachtingworld.com/news/cheeki-rafiki-trial-begins-prosecution-alleges-yacht-owner-cut-corners-to-save-costs-108206|title=Cheeki Rafiki – Prosecution alleges yacht owner 'cut corners to save cost|date=2017-06-08|access-date=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Innes pleaded [[Not guilty plea|not guilty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yachtingworld.com/news/cheeki-rafiki-douglas-innes-pleads-not-guilty-to-six-charges-101118|title=Cheeki Rafiki – Douglas Innes pleads not guilty to six charges|date=2016-12-06|publisher=yachtingworld.com|access-date=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chesley Knight Bonestell, Jr.''' (January 1, 1888 – June 11, 1986) was an American painter, designer and illustrator.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mira.org/bonestell/index.htm Chesley Bonestell (Photograph by Cedric Braun.)] Chesley Bonestell Memorial Lecture Series, ''Each year, the Monterey Institute for Research in Astronomy presents a lecture for the general public supported by funds from the Chesley Bonestell Memorial Lecture Endowment.'' – Monterey Institute for Research in Astronomy&lt;/ref&gt; His paintings were a major influence on science fiction art and illustration, and he helped inspire the American [[space program]]. An pioneering creator of astronomical art, along with the French astronomer-artist [[Lucien Rudaux]], Bonestell was dubbed the "Father of Modern [[Space art]]".

==Life and career==

===Early years===
Bonestell was born in San Francisco, California. His first astronomical painting was done in 1905. After seeing Saturn through the {{convert|12|in|mm|sing=on}} telescope at [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]'s [[Lick Observatory]], he rushed home to paint what he had seen. The painting was destroyed in the fire that followed the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|1906 earthquake]]. Between 1915 and 1918 he exhibited lithographs in the 4th and 7th annual exhibitions of the California Society of Etchers (now the [[California Society of Printmakers]]) in San Francisco.

Bonestell studied architecture at [[Columbia University]] in New York City. Dropping out in his third year, he worked as a renderer and designer for several of the leading [[architecture|architectural]] firms of the time. While with [[William van Alen]], he and Warren Straton designed the [[art deco]] façade of the [[Chrysler Building]] as well as its distinctive eagles.  During this same period, he designed the [[Plymouth Rock|Plymouth Rock Memorial]], the [[U.S. Supreme Court Building]], the [[New York Central Building]], Manhattan office and apartment buildings and several state capitols.&lt;ref name=ches&gt;[http://www.bookpump.com/upb/pdf-b/1128290b.pdf Chesley Bonestell Chronology], By Melvin H. Schuetz, 1999, [[uPublish.com]] Parkland Florida, {{ISBN|1-58112-829-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning to the West Coast, he prepared illustrations of the chief engineer's plans for the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] for the benefit of funders. When the [[Great Depression]] dried up architectural work in the United States, Bonestell went to England, where he rendered architectural subjects for the ''Illustrated London News''. In the late 1930s he moved to Hollywood, where he worked (without screen credit) as a special effects artist, creating [[matte paintings]] for films, including ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' (1939), ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941) and ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons (film)|The Magnificent Ambersons]]'' (1942).

===Magazines===
[[File:Galaxy 195102.jpg|right|thumb|260px|Bonestell's first cover for ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'' (Feb 1951), ''The Tying Down of a Spaceship on Mars in Desert Sandstorm'']]
[[Image:Beta Lyrae Reconstruction.jpg|thumb|right|160px|The [[Beta Lyrae]] binary in the sky of an airless planet, after the painting by Chesley Bonestell.]]Bonestell then realized that he could combine what he had learned about camera angles, miniature modeling, and painting techniques with his lifelong interest in [[astronomy]]. The result was a series of paintings of [[Saturn]] as seen from several of its [[natural satellite|moons]] that was published in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' in 1944. Nothing like these had ever been seen before: they looked as though photographers had been sent into space. His painting of Saturn seen from the frosty moon Titan&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novaspaceart.com/Prints/Limited%20Editions/Bonestell/Titan.html Saturn as Seen from Titan] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527090123/http://www.novaspaceart.com/Prints/Limited%20Editions/Bonestell/Titan.html |date=May 27, 2010 }}, (1944)&lt;/ref&gt; is perhaps the most famous astronomical landscape ever. It was constructed with a combination of clay models, photographic tricks and various painting techniques. (Titan has a thick haze; such a view is probably not possible in reality.)

Bonestell followed up the sensation these paintings created by publishing more paintings in many leading national magazines. These and others were eventually collected in the best-selling book ''[[The Conquest of Space]]'' (1949), produced in collaboration with author [[Willy Ley]]. Bonestell's last work in Hollywood was contributing special effects art and technical advice to the seminal science fiction films produced by [[George Pal]], including ''[[Destination Moon (film)|Destination Moon]]'', ''[[When Worlds Collide (1951 film)|When Worlds Collide]]'', ''[[The War of the Worlds (1953 film)|The War of the Worlds]]'' and ''[[Conquest of Space]]'', as well as ''[[Cat-Women of the Moon]]''. Beginning with the October 1947 issue of ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'', Bonestell painted more than 60 cover illustrations for science fiction magazines, primarily ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction]]'', in the 1950s through 1970s. He also illustrated many book covers.&lt;ref name=isfdb/&gt;

When [[Wernher von Braun]] organized a space flight symposium for ''[[Collier's Weekly|Collier's]]'', he invited Bonestell to illustrate his concepts for the future of spaceflight.  For the first time, spaceflight was shown to be a matter of the near future. Von Braun and Bonestell showed that it could be accomplished with the technology then existing in the mid-1950s, and that the question was that of money and will. Coming as they did at the beginning of the [[Cold War]] and just before the sobering shock of the launch of [[Sputnik]], the 1952–54 ''Collier's'' series, "[[Man Will Conquer Space Soon!]]", was instrumental in kick-starting America's space program.

In 1986, Bonestell died in [[Carmel, California]], with an unfinished painting on his easel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1986-06-26/news/mn-21324_1_chesley-bonestell OBITUARIES : Blended Astronomy and Art : Painter Chesley Bonestell, 98, Dies] – ''Los Angeles Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

During his lifetime, Bonestell was honored internationally for the contributions he made to the birth of modern [[astronautics]], from a bronze medal awarded by the [[British Interplanetary Society]] to a place in the [[International Space Hall of Fame]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmspacemuseum.org/halloffame/detail.php?id=97 Inductee Profile: Chesley K. Bonestell USA, Inducted in 1989], International Space Hall of Fame&lt;/ref&gt; to an asteroid named for him. ''The Conquest of Space'' won the 1951 [[International Fantasy Award]] for nonfiction, one of the first two fantasy or science fiction awards anywhere, at the [[Eastercon|British SF Convention]].&lt;!--also a special award at 1974 Worldcon--&gt;&lt;ref name=SFAwards/&gt; The [[EMP Museum#Science Fiction Hall of Fame|Science Fiction Hall of Fame]] inducted Bonestell in 2005, the first year it considered non-literary contributors.&lt;ref name=sfhof2005/&gt;{{efn|After inducting 36 fantasy and science fiction writers and editors from 1996 to 2004, the hall of fame dropped "fantasy" and made non-literary contributors eligible.

His paintings are prized by collectors and institutions such as the [[National Air and Space Museum]] and the National Collection of Fine Arts. One of his classic paintings, an ethereally beautiful image of Saturn seen from its giant moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], has been called "the painting that launched a thousand careers." Wernher von Braun wrote that he had "learned to respect, nay fear, this wonderful artist's obsession with perfection. My file cabinet is filled with sketches of rocket ships I had prepared to help in his artwork—only to have them returned to me with…blistering criticism."

A [[Impact crater|crater]] on [[Mars]] and the [[asteroid]] [[3129 Bonestell]] are named after him.

In 2016 the first ever album of [[Sun Ra]] vocal tracks was released, ''The Space Age Is Here To Stay,'' featuring sleeve art authorized by the Bonestell estate.&lt;ref name="The Space Age Is Here To Stay"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jazzwisemagazine.com/breaking-news/14328-sun-ra-vinyl-salvos-ready-for-blast-off | title=Sun Ra Vinyl Salvos Ready For Blast Off | publisher=Jazz Wise Magazine | date=August 6, 2016 | accessdate=11 October 2016 | author=Grady, Spencer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aykroyd was born on [[Dominion Day]] (July 1, which is now called Canada Day), 1952 at [[The Ottawa Hospital]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[Ottawa Journal|The Ottawa Evening Journal]]|date=July 1, 1952|page=12|title=Want Ads/Births}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Ottawa]], Ontario, Canada.&lt;ref name="filmr"/&gt; He grew up in Ottawa, Canada's capital, where his father, Samuel Cuthbert Peter Hugh Aykroyd, a civil engineer, worked as a policy adviser to Canadian Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]]. His mother, Lorraine Hélène (née Gougeon), was a secretary.&lt;ref name="filmr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/24/Dan-Aykroyd.html|title=Dan Aykroyd profile|publisher=Filmreference.com|accessdate=April 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dtl&gt;{{Cite book|last=Aykroyd|first=Peter H.|title=The anniversary compulsion: Canada's centennial celebration, a model mega-anniversary|publisher=Dundurn Press Ltd.|year=1992|page=ix|isbn=1-55002-185-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was of [[French Canadian]] descent and his father is of English, Irish, Scottish, Dutch, and French ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C4gYAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Samuel+Cuthbert+Peter+Hugh+Aykroyd%22|title=Current biography yearbook 1992|publisher=H.W. Wilson Company|page=32|location=New York|issn=0011-3344|accessdate=October 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His brother, [[Peter Aykroyd|Peter]], is also an actor.

Aykroyd was born with [[Dactyly#Syndactyly|syndactyly]], or [[webbed toes]], which was revealed in the film ''[[Mr. Mike's Mondo Video]]'' and in a short film on ''Saturday Night Live'' titled "Don't Look Back In Anger".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/77/77manger.phtml|title=Don't Look Back In Anger|publisher=Snltranscripts.jt.org|accessdate=April 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aykroyd was raised in the Catholic Church, and until age 17 he intended to become a priest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.adherents.com/people/pa/Dan_Aykroyd.html|title=The religion of Dan Aykroyd, actor, comedian|publisher=Adherents.com|date=September 20, 2005|accessdate=October 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[St. Pius X High School (Ottawa)|St. Pius X]] and [[St. Patrick's High School (Ottawa)|St. Patrick's]] high schools, and studied [[criminology]] and [[sociology]] at [[Carleton University]], but dropped out before completing his degree. He worked as a comedian in various Canadian [[nightclub]]s and ran an after-hours [[speakeasy]], Club 505, in Toronto for several years.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Aykroyd developed his musical career in Ottawa, particularly through his regular attendances at [[Le Hibou|The Owl]], a club that featured many blues artists. He describes these influences as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...there was a little disco club there called Le Hibou, which in French means 'the owl.' And it was run by a gentleman named [[Harvey Glatt]], and he brought every, and I mean every, blues star that you or I would ever have wanted to have seen through Ottawa in the late '50s, well I guess more late '60s sort of, in around the Newport jazz rediscovery. I was going to Le Hibou and hearing [[James Cotton]], [[Otis Spann]], [[Pinetop Perkins]], and [[Muddy Waters]]. I actually jammed behind Muddy Waters. S.P. Leary left the drum kit one night, and Muddy said 'anybody out there play drums? I don't have a drummer.' And I walked on stage and we started, I don't know, [[Little Red Rooster]], something. He said 'keep that beat going, you make Muddy feel good.' And I heard [[Howlin' Wolf]] (Chester Burnett). Many, many times I saw Howlin' Wolf. As well as [[The Doors]]. And of course [[Buddy Guy]], Buddy Guy and [[Junior Wells]], [[Sonny Terry]] and [[Brownie McGhee]]. So I was exposed to all of these players, playing there as part of this scene to service the academic community in Ottawa, a very well-educated community. Had I lived in a different town I don't think that this would have happened, because it was just the confluence of educated government workers, and then also all the colleges in the area, [[University of Ottawa|Ottawa University]], [[Carleton University|Carleton]], and all the schools—these people were interested in blues culture.&lt;ref name="AustinSound"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austinsound.net/author/roger-gatchet/page/2|title=Still on a mission from God: interview with Dan Aykroyd|author=Roger Gatchet|date=May 18, 2007|publisher=www.austinsound.net|accessdate=October 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This recollection of Aykroyd is subject to challenge. Some assert that it was Ottawa artist [http://astro.ncf.ca/images/fuzzy6.pdf Arthur II] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706190339/http://astro.ncf.ca/images/fuzzy6.pdf |date=July 6, 2011 }} who joined the band to play drums and that, at best, Aykroyd was a member of the audience. Aykroyd's recollection as to who actually played at Le Hibou is also questionable as Pinetop Perkins never appeared, and Howlin' Wolf appeared once.&lt;sup&gt;[citation required]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Aykroyd's first professional experience, which he gained at the age of 17, was as a member of the cast of the short-lived Canadian sketch comedy series ''[[The Hart and Lorne Terrific Hour]]'' with [[Lorne Michaels]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starpulse.com/Actors/Aykroyd,_Dan/Biography|title=Dan Aykroyd profile|website=Starpulse.com|accessdate=March 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the [[The Second City|Second City]] comedy troupe in 1973 in both Toronto and Chicago.&lt;ref name="sc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Alumni|url=http://www.secondcity.com/history/alumni|publisher=The Second City|accessdate=October 22, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091206065654/http://www.secondcity.com/history/alumni|archivedate=December 6, 2009|df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Saturday Night Live''==
Aykroyd gained fame on the American late-night comedy show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. He was originally hired, and paid $278 a week, as a writer for the show, but became a part of the cast before the series premiered. The original cast was referred to on the show as "The Not Ready For Prime Time Players". Aykroyd was the youngest member of the cast, and appeared on the show for its first four seasons, from 1975–79. He brought a unique sensibility to the show, combining youth, unusual interests, talent as an [[impersonator]], and an almost lunatic intensity. Guest host [[Eric Idle]] of [[Monty Python]] said that Aykroyd's ability to write and act out characters flawlessly made him the only member of the ''SNL'' cast capable of being a Python.&lt;ref name="snl20050220"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Live from New York: The First 5 Years of Saturday Night Live|series=''SNL''|network=NBC|airdate=2005-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was known for his impersonations of celebrities like [[Jimmy Carter]], [[Vincent Price]], [[Richard Nixon]], [[Rod Serling]], [[Tom Snyder]], [[Julia Child]], and others. He was also known for his recurring roles, such as Beldar, father of the [[Coneheads]] family; with [[Steve Martin]], Yortuk Festrunk, one of the "Two Wild and Crazy Guys" [[Czech Republic|Czech]] brothers; sleazy late-night cable TV host E. Buzz Miller and his cousin, corrupt maker of children's toys and costumes Irwin Mainway (who extolled the virtues and defended the safety of the "Bag-o-Glass" toy, perhaps the retail leader of the "Bag-o" series of toys); Fred Garvin – male prostitute; and high-bred but low-brow critic [[Leonard Pinth-Garnell]]. He also co-hosted the [[Weekend Update]] segment for one season with [[Jane Curtin]], known particularly for their point-counterpoint debates enlivened with vicious personal insults including his [[catchphrase]] "Jane, you ignorant slut".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/point-counterpoint-lee-marvin-and-michelle-triola/2846665|title=Point Counterpoint: Lee Marvin and Michelle Triola|date=March 17, 1979|website=Nbc.com|accessdate=May 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aykroyd's eccentric talent was recognized by others in the highly competitive ''SNL'' environment: when he first presented his famous "Super Bass-O-Matic '76" sketch, a fake T.V. commercial in which a garish, hyper-pitchman touts a [[blender (device)|food blender]] that turns an entire [[striped bass|bass]] into liquid pulp, "to [other writers and cast members] the 'Bass-O-Matic' was so exhilaratingly strange that many remember sitting and listening, open-mouthed ... Nobody felt jealous of it because they couldn't imagine writing anything remotely like it."&lt;ref&gt;Hill and Weingrad p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; While Aykroyd was a close friend and partner with fellow cast member [[John Belushi]] and shared some of the same sensibilities, Aykroyd was more reserved and less self-destructive. Aykroyd later recalled that, unlike Belushi and other of his peers, he was uninterested in recreational drug use.&lt;ref&gt;"I was never into the powders or pills. I tried it all but didn't like that clenched-teeth feeling. I didn't like the 'I'm a palpitating rabbit and I'm gonna solve the world's problems' feeling either. I drank some beers. I'm still here." Sean O'Hagan, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2003/sep/28/features.review "I'm still haunted by Belushi"], ''The Observer''  September 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, he received an [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Variety Series|Emmy Award]] for writing on ''SNL''; he later received two more nominations for writing and one for acting. In ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s February 2015 appraisal of all 141 ''Saturday night live'' cast members to date, Aykroyd was ranked fifth (behind Belushi, [[Eddie Murphy]], [[Tina Fey]], and [[Mike Myers]]). "Of all the original [''SNL''] greats, Aykroyd is the least imitated", they wrote, "because nobody else can do what he did."&lt;ref&gt;''Rolling Stone'', issue 1229, February 26, 2015, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

In later decades, Aykroyd made occasional guest appearances and unannounced [[Cameo appearance|cameo]]s on ''SNL'', often impersonating the American politician [[Bob Dole]]. He would also bring back past characters including Irwin Mainway and Leonard Pinth-Garnell.

During some guest appearances he resurrected [[The Blues Brothers]] musical act with frequent host [[John Goodman]] in place of Belushi. He became the second member of the original cast to host ''SNL'' in May 2003 when he appeared in the season finale. During his monologue, he performed a musical number with [[James Belushi]] similar to the Blues Brothers, but neither Aykroyd nor Belushi donned the famous black suit and sunglasses. On March 24, 2007, Aykroyd appeared as a crying fan of ''[[American Idol]]'' finalist [[Sanjaya Malakar]] (played by [[Andy Samberg]]) during [[Weekend Update]]. On February 14, 2009, he appeared as U.S. House Minority leader [[John Boehner]]. Aykroyd also made a surprise guest appearance, along with many other ''SNL'' alumni, on the show of March 9, 2013.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==The Blues Brothers==
{{main|The Blues Brothers}}

Aykroyd was a close friend of [[John Belushi]]. According to Aykroyd, it was their first meeting that helped spark the [[Blues Brothers]] act. When they met in a club Aykroyd frequented, he played a blues record in the background, and it stimulated a fascination with blues in Belushi, who was primarily a fan of heavy rock bands at the time. Aykroyd educated Belushi on the finer points of blues music and, with a little encouragement from then-''SNL'' music director [[Paul Shaffer]], it led to the creation of their Blues Brothers characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=The Blues Brothers - Soul Man|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2010/12/the-blues-brothers-soul-man.html|language=en|accessdate=2018-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2013/01/making-of-blues-brothers-budget-for-cocaine|title=Making Blues Brothers With John Belushi and Dan Akroyd—"We Had a Budget for Cocaine"|last=Zeman|first=Ned|work=HWD|access-date=2018-01-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Backed by such experienced professional R&amp;B sidemen as lead guitarist [[Steve Cropper]], sax man [[Lou Marini]], trumpeter [[Alan Rubin]], and bass guitarist [[Donald "Duck" Dunn]], the Blues Brothers proved more than an ''SNL'' novelty. Taking off with the public as a legitimate musical act, they performed live gigs and in 1978 released the hit album ''[[Briefcase Full of Blues]]'' (drawn from the fact that Aykroyd, as "Elwood Blues", carried his blues harmonicas in a briefcase that he kept handcuffed to his wrist, in the manner of a CIA courier; Belushi originally carried the key to those handcuffs). ''Briefcase Full of Blues'' eventually sold 3.5 million copies, and is one of the highest-selling blues albums of all time.&lt;ref name="AustinSound" /&gt; The band was much further popularized in the 1980 film ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'', which Aykroyd co-wrote.

Early in the incarnation of the Blues Brothers, Belushi joined the [[Grateful Dead]] on stage on April 2, 1980, for a rendition of "Good Morning Little School Girl" at the Capitol Theatre in Passaic, New Jersey that coincided with the Dead's appearance on ''SNL'' that weekend. Belushi sang the part usually carried by the late band member [[Ron "Pigpen" McKernan]].

[[Cherokee Studios]] in Los Angeles was a regular haunt for the original Blues Brothers in the early days of the band. Belushi and Aykroyd became fixtures at the recording studio, while fellow Blues Brother Steve Cropper called Cherokee his producing home. Whenever they needed a bass player, they were joined by another Blues Brother, Donald "Duck" Dunn. During this time, Cropper, along with producing partner and Cherokee owner [[Bruce Robb (producer)|Bruce Robb]], worked on a number of music projects with the two comedians/musicians, including Belushi's favorite band, [[Fear (band)|Fear]], and later Aykroyd's movie ''Dragnet''.

The Blues Brothers Band continues to tour today, both with and without Aykroyd. The band features original members Cropper and Marini, along with vocalist [[Eddie Floyd]]. Aykroyd sometimes performs as Elwood, along with Belushi's younger brother [[Jim Belushi]], who plays "Brother Zee" on stage. They are most frequently backed by The Sacred Hearts Band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Karen|url=http://www.jimbelushi.ws/jim-sacredhearts.htm|title=Jim Belushi and the Sacred Hearts|publisher=Jimbelushi.ws|date=January 28, 2011|accessdate=May 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other film and television work==
{{BLP sources section|date=August 2017}}
[[File:Greatoutdoors aykroyd.jpg|thumb|left|Aykroyd (right) on the set of ''[[The Great Outdoors (film)|The Great Outdoors]]'', 1987]]
Concurrent with his work in ''Saturday Night Live'', Aykroyd played the role of Purvis Bickle, lift operator at the fictitious office block 99 Sumach Street in the [[CBC Television]] series ''[[Coming Up Rosie]]''.

After leaving ''Saturday Night Live'', Aykroyd starred in a number of films, mostly comedies, with uneven results both commercially and artistically. His first three American feature films all co-starred Belushi. The first, ''[[1941 (film)|1941]]'' (1979), directed by [[Steven Spielberg]], was a [[box office bomb|box office disappointment]]. The second, ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'' (1980), which he co-wrote with director [[John Landis]], was a massive hit. The third, ''[[Neighbors (1981 film)|Neighbors]]'' (1981) had mixed critical reaction but was another box-office hit. One of his best-received performances was as a blueblood-turned-wretch in the 1983 comedy ''[[Trading Places]]'', in which he co-starred with fellow ''SNL'' alumnus [[Eddie Murphy]] as well as [[Jamie Lee Curtis]].

In the early 1980s, Aykroyd began work on a script for the film that eventually became ''[[Ghostbusters]]'', inspired by his fascination with [[parapsychology]]. The script initially included a much greater fantasy element, including [[time travel]], but this was toned down substantially through work on the script with [[Harold Ramis]] (who became a co-writer) and director [[Ivan Reitman]]. Aykroyd originally wrote the role of Dr. Peter Venkman with Belushi in mind, but rewrote it for [[Bill Murray]] after Belushi's death. Aykroyd joked that the green ghost, later known as "Slimer", was "the ghost of John Belushi" and was based on Belushi's party animal personality. ''Ghostbusters'' was released in 1984 and became a huge success for Aykroyd, who also appeared as one of the lead actors; the film earned nearly {{US$|300{{nbsp}}million|link=yes}} on a {{US$|30{{nbsp}}million}} budget.

Aykroyd's next major film role was in the 1985 spy comedy film ''[[Spies Like Us]]'', which like ''The Blues Brothers'' was co-conceived and co-written by Aykroyd, and directed by Landis. Aykroyd had again intended for Belushi to be the other lead in the film; the part was instead given to ''SNL'' alumnus [[Chevy Chase]]. The film was intended as an homage to the [[Bob Hope]]/[[Bing Crosby]] "[[Road to ...]]" movies of the 1940s to 1960s. Bob Hope made a cameo appearance in the film.

1987 saw the release of ''[[Dragnet (1987 film)|Dragnet]]'', which Aykroyd co-starred in (with [[Tom Hanks]]) and co-wrote. The film was both an homage and a satire of the [[Dragnet (franchise)|previous ''Dragnet'' series]], with Aykroyd playing Sgt. [[Joe Friday]] as a police officer whose law-and-order attitude is at odds with modern sensibilities.
[[File:AykroydNY1.jpg|thumb|Aykroyd in [[Santa Monica, California]] for a documentary about ''Ghostbusters'', 2010]]
Aykroyd appeared in five films released in 1988, all of them critical and commercial failures. A sequel to ''Ghostbusters'', ''[[Ghostbusters II]]'', was released in 1989; Aykroyd and the other co-creators were reluctant to make another ''Ghostbusters'' film but succumbed to pressure from the film's studio, [[Columbia Pictures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Ghostly Movie|work= The Los Angeles Times|date=May 17, 1987|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1987-05-17/entertainment/ca-380_1_david-puttnam|accessdate=November 8, 2010|first=Leonard|last=Klady}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film, while considered inferior to the original, was another big hit, earning {{US$|215{{nbsp}}million}}. Aykroyd was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for 1989's ''[[Driving Miss Daisy]]''. He was the second ''SNL'' cast member to be nominated for an Oscar, the first being [[Joan Cusack]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Aykroyd's [[film director|directorial]] debut was 1991's ''[[Nothing but Trouble (1991 film)|Nothing but Trouble]]'' starring [[Demi Moore]], [[Chevy Chase]], [[John Candy]] and Aykroyd, sporting a bulbous prosthetic nose. The film was a critical and box office flop. Aykroyd's other films in the 1990s were mostly similarly poorly-received, including ''[[Coneheads (film)|Coneheads]]'' (also based on a ''Saturday Night Live'' skit), ''[[Exit to Eden (film)|Exit to Eden]]'', ''[[Blues Brothers 2000]]'', and ''[[Getting Away with Murder (1996 film)|Getting Away with Murder]]''. Two exceptions were ''[[Tommy Boy (film)|Tommy Boy]]'' (1995), which starred ''SNL'' alumni [[David Spade]] and [[Chris Farley]], in which Aykroyd played the role of Ray Zalinsky, and ''[[Grosse Pointe Blank]]'' (1997), in which Aykroyd had a well-received role as a rival hit man.

In 1994, Aykroyd made a guest appearance in an episode of the sitcom ''[[The Nanny]]'' as a refrigerator repairman. In 1997, he starred as an Episcopal priest in the ABC sitcom ''[[Soul Man (TV series)|Soul Man]]'' which lasted two seasons. In 1998, Aykroyd voiced the role of Chip, a wasp, in ''[[Antz]]''. In 2001, he starred in the [[Woody Allen]] film ''[[The Curse of the Jade Scorpion]]''. Most of his film roles since then have tended to be small character parts in big-budget productions, such as a signals analyst in ''[[Pearl Harbor (film)|Pearl Harbor]]'' and a neurologist in ''[[50 First Dates]]''.

In 2009, Aykroyd and Ramis wrote and appeared in ''[[Ghostbusters: The Video Game]]'', which also featured Bill Murray, [[Ernie Hudson]], [[Annie Potts]], [[William Atherton]], and [[Brian Doyle-Murray]]. In 2010, he played the voice of the title character, [[Yogi Bear]], in the live-action/CGI-animated-film ''[[Yogi Bear (film)|Yogi Bear]]''. That same year, Aykroyd and Chevy Chase guest starred in the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode "[[Spies Reminiscent of Us]]", an homage to ''Spies Like Us''.

Aykroyd appeared in two February 2011 episodes of CBS's ''[[The Defenders (2010 TV series)|The Defenders]]'', which starred Jim Belushi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Dan-Aykroyd-Defenders-1026196.aspx|title=Dan Aykroyd to Reunite with Jim Belushi on The Defenders|publisher=TVGuide.com|accessdate=November 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also appeared on ''Top Chef Canada'' as a guest judge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/17/AR2011021706507.html|title=TV Highlights: Dan Aykroyd on 'The Defenders'; Dina Lohan on '20/20'; 'Gold Rush: Alaska' finale|publisher=The Washington Post|date=February 18, 2011|accessdate=February 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Aykroyd voiced the role of [[Scarecrow (Oz)|Scarecrow]] in ''[[Legends of Oz: Dorothy's Return]]''. In 2015, he appeared in a [[State Farm]] insurance commercial along with [[Jane Curtin]], as the [[Coneheads]], talking to "Jake", a State Farm agent.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Aykroyd was one of the executive producers of ''[[Ghostbusters (2016 film)|Ghostbusters]]'', a long-discussed reboot of the [[Ghostbusters (franchise)|''Ghostbusters'' franchise]], which was released in 2016. Aykroyd had a cameo appearance in the film, along with many of the rest of the original ''Ghostbusters'' cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2015/03/ghostbusters-channing-tatum-joe-and-anthony-russo-drew-pearce-ivan-reitman-dan-aykroyd-1201388917|title=Sony Plans New ‘Ghostbusters’ Film With Russo Brothers, Channing Tatum &amp; ‘IM3′ Scribe Drew Pearce|publisher=Deadline|date=March 9, 2015|accessdate=March 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fangoria.com/new/ghostbusters-expanding-franchise|title=Reitman, Aykroyd Team For ‘Ghostcorp'; Expanding "GHOSTBUSTERS" Franchise|publisher=[[Fangoria]]|date=March 9, 2015|accessdate=March 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other musical endeavors==
Aykroyd participated in the recording of "[[We Are the World]]" in 1985, as a member of the chorus. He wrote the liner notes for fellow Ottawa-born blues musician [[JW-Jones]]'s album ''Bluelisted'' in 2008. He hosts the nationally, now internationally as well, syndicated radio show "Elwood's BluesMobile", formerly known as ''House of Blues Radio Hour'', under his Blues Brothers moniker Elwood Blues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebluesmobile.com/ |title=TheBluesmobile.com |publisher=TheBluesmobile.com|accessdate=May 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business ventures==
[[File:Crystal_Head_Vodka.jpg|thumb|Bottle of Crystal Head Vodka]]
In 1992, Aykroyd and [[Hard Rock Cafe]] co-founder [[Isaac Tigrett]] founded the [[House of Blues]], a chain of music venues, with the mission to promote African-American cultural contributions of [[blues|blues music]] and [[folk art]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Many other music and Hollywood personalities helped to finance it at its start. It began as a single location in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], although other locations quickly followed, starting with a venue in [[New Orleans]] in 1994. In 2004 House of Blues became the second-largest live music promoter in the world, with seven venues and 22 amphitheaters in the United States and Canada. It was bought by [[Live Nation]] in 2006.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

In 2007, Aykroyd and artist [[John Alexander (artist)|John Alexander]] founded [[Crystal Head Vodka]], a brand of high-end [[vodka]] known for its distinctive skull-shaped bottle and for being filtered through [[Herkimer diamond]] crystals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://crystalheadvodka.com/en/faq|title=Crystal Head Vodka FAQ|accessdate=May 20, 2016|publisher=Crystal Head Vodka}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charitable works==
In 2009, Aykroyd contributed a series of reminiscences on his upbringing in Canada for a charity album titled ''Dan Aykroyd's Canada''. He helped start the Blue Line Foundation, which is redeveloping flood-damaged lots in New Orleans and helping [[first responder]]s buy them at reduced prices. Coastal Blue Line LLC, hopes to eventually rebuild 400 properties in New Orleans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eliot Kamenitz|url=http://www.nola.com/news/index.ssf/2009/04/photo_dan_aykroyd_tours_neighb.html|title=Blues Brother Dan Aykroyd launches home building project for first responders|publisher=Nola.com|accessdate=April 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aykroyd is a member of Canadian charity Artists Against Racism.&lt;ref&gt;http://artistsagainstracism.org/artists/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Aykroyd was briefly engaged to actress [[Carrie Fisher]]. He proposed to her on the set of ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'' (1980), in which she appeared as a spurned girlfriend of John Belushi's Jake Blues who was trying to kill both brothers. The engagement ended when she reconciled with her former boyfriend, musician [[Paul Simon]]. In 1983, he married actress [[Donna Dixon]]; they met on the set of ''[[Doctor Detroit]]'' released the same year. They went on to appear together in three additional films: ''[[Spies Like Us]]'' (1985); ''[[Twilight Zone: The Movie]]'' (1983); and ''[[The Couch Trip]]'' (1988). They have three daughters, Danielle, Stella, and Belle.

Aykroyd maintains his Canadian roots as a longtime resident of [[Sydenham, Frontenac County, Ontario|Sydenham, Ontario]], with his estate on [[Loughborough Lake]].

In a 2004 [[NPR]] interview with host [[Terry Gross]], Aykroyd said that he had been diagnosed in childhood with [[Tourette syndrome]] (TS) as well as [[Asperger syndrome]] (AS). He stated that his TS was successfully treated with therapy.&lt;ref name=Gross&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Comedian -- and Writer -- Dan Aykroyd|episode-link=|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4181931|access-date=2011-05-15|series=Fresh Air|series-link=|first=Terry|last=Gross|network=NPR|station=|date=2004-11-22|season=|series-no=|number=|minutes=|time=29:50|transcript=|transcript-url=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, he stated during a ''HuffPost Show'' interview with hosts Roy Sekoff and Marc Lamont Hill that his AS was "never diagnosed" but was "sort of a self-diagnosis" based on several of his own characteristics.&lt;ref name=HuffPostShow&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5rQJpYHIAA|title=Dan Aykroyd – Full Interview|last=|first=|date=2015-04-18|website=|publisher=HuffPost Show|accessdate=June 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aykroyd is a former reserve commander for the police department in [[Harahan, Louisiana]], working for Chief of Police Peter Dale. Aykroyd would carry his badge with him at all times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=CISNMike|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgKHCB7lnog|title=Dan Aykroyd Shows his Badge|publisher=YouTube.com|date=February 14, 2007|accessdate=April 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He currently serves as a Reserve Deputy of the Hinds County Sheriff's Department in [[Hinds County, Mississippi]].  He supports the Reserves with a fundraiser concert along with other blues and gospel singers in the State of Mississippi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnewsnow.com/story/24546885/dan-aykroyd-sworn-in-as-hinds-county-deputy|title=Dan Aykroyd sworn in as Hinds County deputy|website=Msnewsnow.com|accessdate=May 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Friendship with John Belushi===
In an appearance on the ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]'' show, Aykroyd referred to himself and [[John Belushi]] as "kindred spirits". In the biography "Belushi", Aykroyd claims that Belushi was the only man he could ever dance with. Aykroyd and Belushi were scheduled to present the Academy Award for Visual Effects in 1982, but Belushi died only a few weeks prior to the ceremony. Though devastated by his friend's death, Aykroyd presented the award alone, remarking from the stage: "My partner would have loved to have been here to present this, given that he was something of a visual effect himself."&lt;ref&gt;{{Link YouTube|id=t8hI5on2jqg|Raiders of the Lost Ark Wins Visual Effects: 1982 Oscars}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aykroyd was openly hostile to the 1989 film ''[[Wired (film)|Wired]]'', a biopic of Belushi (which featured Aykroyd as a character played by actor Gary Groomes), and has since refused to work with anyone involved in the film. He had actor [[J. T. Walsh]] fired from the film ''[[Loose Cannons (1990 film)|Loose Cannons]]'' after Walsh had already done two days of filming, after finding out that Walsh had been in the cast of ''Wired''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-04-13/entertainment/ca-1870_1_caa-belushi-friends-wired/2|work=Los Angeles Times|first1=Nina J.|last1=Easton|first2=Jack|last2=Mathews|title=Another Chapter in the Strange Odyssey of 'Wired'|date=April 13, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beliefs===
Aykroyd considers himself a [[Spiritualism|Spiritualist]], stating that:
:I am a Spiritualist, a proud wearer of the Spiritualist badge. Mediums and psychic research have gone on for many, many years .... Loads of people have seen spirits, heard a voice or felt the cold temperature. I believe that they are between here and there, that they exist between the fourth and fifth dimension, and that they visit us frequently.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Psychic News|last=Aykroyd|first=Dan|work=''[[Psychic News]]'' Issue #4001|date=April 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aykroyd's great-grandfather, a dentist, was a [[Mysticism|mystic]] who corresponded with author [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] on the subject of Spiritualism, and who was a member of the [[Lily Dale, New York|Lily Dale Society]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Other than Spiritualism, Aykroyd is also interested in various other aspects of the [[paranormal]], particularly [[UFOlogy]]. He is a lifetime member of and official Hollywood consultant for the [[Mutual UFO Network]]. Along these lines, he served, from 1996 to 2000, as "host" of ''[[Psi Factor: Chronicles of the Paranormal]]'', which claimed to describe cases drawn from the archives of "The Office Of Scientific Investigation And Research." In 2005, Aykroyd produced the DVD ''Dan Aykroyd: Unplugged on UFOs''.

Aykroyd is interviewed for 80 minutes by [[UFOlogist]] David Sereda discussing in depth many aspects of the UFO phenomenon.&lt;ref name=UNPLUGGED&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uforc.com/news/daufo-KlewMedia_060206.htm |title=UFORC News Service: Dan Aykroyd Unplugged on UFOs|accessdate=February 9, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219024119/http://www.uforc.com/news/daufo-KlewMedia_060206.htm|archivedate=December 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 29, 2009, Peter Aykroyd Sr., Dan's father, published a book entitled ''A History of Ghosts''. This book chronicled the family's historical involvement in the Spiritualist Movement, to which Aykroyd readily refers. Aykroyd wrote the introduction and accompanied his father on a series of promotional activities, including launches in New York and Toronto,  appearances on ''[[Larry King Live]]'', ''[[Coast to Coast AM]]'' and various other public relations initiatives. Aykroyd also read the introduction for the audio version of the book.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} In 1997, the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] (CSICOP) awarded Aykroyd ''in absentia'' the ''Snuffed Candle Award'' for hosting [[Psi Factor]] and being a "long-time promoter ... of paranormal claims". Following the awards, [[Joe Nickell]] wrote to Aykroyd asking for the research behind the "cases" presented on Psi Factor, particularly a claim that NASA scientists were "killed while investigating a meteor crash and giant eggs were found and incubated, yielding a flea the size of a hog".&lt;ref name="Candle awards 1997"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Nye, Aykroyd Receive Council's First Awards|journal=Skeptical Inquirer|date=1997|volume=21|issue=3|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Daniel of Moscopole''' or '''Daniil of Moscopole''' (1754–1825) ({{lang-el|Δανιήλ Μοσχοπολίτης}}, ''Daniil Moschopolitis''; {{lang-rup|Daniil Moscopoleanu}}) (1754–1825) or '''Mihali Adami Hagi''' ({{lang-rup|Mihali Adami Hagi}}) was an [[Aromanians|Aromanian]] scholar from [[Moscopole]], student of [[Theodore Kavalliotis|Theodoros Kavalliotis]], 18th/19th-century professor and director of [[New Academy (Moscopole)|New Academy]] of Moscopole.

==Background==
In 1794, he published in Moscopole the first dictionary of four modern Balkan languages (Greek, Albanian, Aromanian and Bulgarian). Many authors published their works in both Greek and Aromanian, written in the [[Greek alphabet]]. With his lexicographic work, Daniel hoped to persuade the Albanians, Aromanians and Bulgarians to abandon their "''barbaric''" tongues and learn Greek, the "''mother of knowledge''". The book was republished in 1802 in Ragusa, [[Dubrovnik]]&lt;ref&gt;"Четириезичният речник на Даниил (гръцка и българска част). Годишник на Софийския университет. Факултет по западни филологии, т.

Kristophson, Das Lexikon Tetraglosson des Daniil Moschopolitis, in: Zeitschrift für Balkanologie, 10 (1974), pp. 7-128.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Daniel in his work ''Εισαγωγική Διδασκαλία'' ("Introductory instruction"),&lt;ref&gt;Central European University Press.

Daniel invited non-Greek speakers with this dictionary to learn the Greek language:&lt;ref&gt;Kostantaras Dean J..

'''Doctor Death''' is a [[mad scientist]] and [[supervillain]] appearing in publications by [[DC Comics]]. The character was created officially by  [[Bob Kane]] as an enemy of the superhero [[Batman]], and first appeared in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #29 (July 1939). He is notable as the first traditional supervillain to be encountered by the Batman, as well as his first recurring foe.

==Fictional character biography==
===Golden Age===
In his first appearance in ''Detective Comics'' #29, Doctor Death develops a lethal chemical agent from [[pollen]] extract and enacts a plan to use the poison to [[extortion|extort]] money from wealthy [[Gotham City]] citizens. He is assisted by a large [[East India]]n manservant, Jabah. He decides to eliminate Batman, and threatens to kill someone unless Batman stops him. Batman defeats his two henchmen, but is wounded when Jabah shoots him, though he escapes using a gas pellet. He then gets to Doctor Death's base, meeting him in his lab, and chases him around the building. In order to evade capture, Doctor Death ignites chemicals in his laboratory, presumably killing Jabah and himself in the resulting explosion.&lt;ref&gt;"The Batman Meets Doctor Death" (''[[Detective Comics]]'' #29 (July 1939)). ''The Batman Archives Volume 1''. New York: DC Comics, 1990. 22-31.&lt;/ref&gt; Doctor Death next appears the following month in ''Detective Comics'' #30. With a new accomplice, a [[Cossack]] named Mikhail, Doctor Death is this time successful in claiming a victim in his extortion scheme, but discovers from the widow that the poisoned man lost his fortune in the [[Great Depression]]. Batman intervenes in the plot, following Mikhail back to Doctor Death's base, and upon apprehending the doctor, discovers that his face had been horribly disfigured from the lab explosion, resulting in a brown, skeletal appearance.&lt;ref&gt;''Detective Comics'' #30 (August 1939). ''The Batman Archives Volume 1''. New York: DC Comics, 1990. 32-42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The scriptwriter for ''Detective Comics'' #29 and #30 is an issue of dispute, leaving the creator of Doctor Death uncertain.  Batman creator [[Bob Kane]] is officially credited as scriptwriter of these issues, though later [[Gardner Fox]], the scriptwriter of ''Detective Comics'' #31 and #32, claimed authorship.&lt;ref&gt;[[Les Daniels|Daniels, Les]]. ''Batman: The Complete History''. Chronicle Books, 1999. {{ISBN|0-8118-4232-0}}, pg. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bronze Age revival===
After several decades' absence, Doctor Death was reintroduced by writer [[Gerry Conway]] in ''Batman'' #345 and ''Detective Comics'' #512 (1982). Conway's story is an update of the original 1939 tale. In this version, Doctor Death is depicted as a [[paraplegic]], but his deadly gas gimmick remains the same. He is assisted this time by a manservant named Togo.

===Modern Age===
Doctor Death was revived once again in ''[[Batgirl]]'' #42-44 and #50 (2003–2004) by writer [[Dylan Horrocks]]. The modern Doctor Death is a producer of [[biological weapon]]s, often selling them on the [[black market]] to terrorists and other criminals. He is now depicted as a bald, [[gnome]]-like man wearing a lab coat and an oxygen mask. This incarnation of Doctor Death plays a minor role in ''[[Batman: War Games]] Act Three'' where he is seen working with the crimelord [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]], releasing a gas into a crowd of panicking [[gangster]]s. Batman suspects that he and Black Mask are attempting to wipe out their competition.

Doctor Death remains active in the [[DC Universe]] following the events of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]''. In the second issue of ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', he is mentioned as one of many mad scientists who have gone missing. He is depicted later in the series among other captured scientists and mad [[genius]]es on Oolong Island that make up the [[Science Squad]].

He was seen joining forces with Black Mask again in ''[[Batman]]'' #692, in his Ministry of Science.

In ''[[Batman: Streets of Gotham]]'' #17 and #18, the reader comes to know of his backstory involving an altercation with [[Thomas Wayne|Thomas]] and [[Martha Wayne]].

===The New 52===
In September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, a new version of Doctor Death makes an appearance in ''Batman'' #25 as part of the story arc ''[[Batman: Zero Year]]''. He is once again established as one of the first supervillains encountered by Batman early in his career. A disgruntled former [[Wayne Enterprises]] scientist, Doctor Death murders several people with a serum that causes uncontrolled bone growth. He is depicted with a skeletal appearance, a result of testing his serum on himself. Doctor Death joins forces with the [[Riddler]] to try to seize control of Gotham City during a super-storm. 

In ''Batman'' #29 (2014), it is revealed that Hellfern created his bone serum in an attempt to eliminate human weakness. This was motivated by the death of his son, a soldier who had been sent to locate the missing [[Bruce Wayne]] overseas. Doctor Death battles Batman aboard a blimp in the midst of the storm. He is struck by shrapnel from an explosion, which causes his mutated bones to begin growing again, seemingly killing him.

==Other versions==
A different character named Doctor Death appears in ''[[Doom Patrol]]'' (vol. 1) #107 (November 1966). In ''[[Sandman Mystery Theatre]]'' #21 (December 1994) [[Sandman (Wesley Dodds)|Wesley Dodds]] encounters a [[serial killer]] named "Dr. Death."  This Dr. Death is responsible for [[euthanasia|euthanizing]] his elderly patients (in a reference to [[Jack Kevorkian]]).

'''Farah Pahlavi''', née '''Diba''' ({{lang-fa|فرح پهلوی}}; born 14 October 1938) is the widow of [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] and the exiled ''[[shahbanu]]'' ([[Empress consort|empress]]) of [[Iran]].

==Childhood==
[[File:Fpboyscout.jpg|thumb|left|Farah Diba, with Iranian boyscouts in [[Paris]]]]
Farah Diba was born on 14 October 1938 in [[Tehran]] to an upper-class family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The life and times of the Shah|first=Gholam Reza|last=Afkhami|page=44|isbn=978-0-520-25328-5|publisher=University of California Press|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shakibi, Zhand|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZlptU4A2HkUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0 |title=Revolutions and the Collapse of Monarchy: Human Agency and the Making of Revolution in France, Russia, and Iran|publisher= I.B. Tauris|year=2007|ISBN= 1-84511-292-X|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Taheri, Amir 1991. p. 160"&gt;Taheri, Amir. ''The Unknown Life of the Shah''. Hutchinson, 1991. {{ISBN|0-09-174860-7}}; p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; Born as Farah Diba, she was the only child of Captain Sohrab Diba (1899–1948) and his wife, Farideh Ghotbi (1920–2000). Farah's father's family is of [[Iranian Azerbaijanis|Iranian Azerbaijani origin]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taheri, Amir 1991. p. 160"/&gt; In her memoir, the former Shahbanu writes that her father's family were natives of [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Iranian Azerbaijan]] while her mother's family were of [[Gilak]] origin, from [[Lahijan]] on the Iranian coast of the [[Caspian Sea]].&lt;ref name=enduring&gt;Pahlavi, Farah. 'An Enduring Love: My life with The Shah. A Memoir' 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Through her father, Farah came from a relatively affluent background. In the late 19th century her grandfather had been an accomplished diplomat, serving as the Iranian [[Ambassador]] to the [[House of Romanov|Romanov]] Court in [[St. Petersburg]], [[Russia]]. Her own father was an officer in the [[Imperial Iranian Armed Forces]] and a graduate of the prestigious French Military Academy at [[École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr|St. Cyr]].

Farah wrote in her memoir that she had a close bond with her father, and his unexpected death in 1948 deeply affected her.&lt;ref name=enduring/&gt; The young family was in a difficult financial state. In these reduced circumstances, they were forced to move from their large family villa in northern [[Tehran]] into a shared apartment with one of Farideh Ghotbi's brothers.

==Education and engagement==

}}
The young Farah Diba began her education at Tehran's Italian School, then moved to the French Jeanne d'Arc School until the age of sixteen and later to the [[Razi High School|Lycée Razi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.farahpahlavi.org/sports.html|title=Empress Farah Pahlavi Official Site - سایت رسمی‌ شهبانو فرح پهلوی|work=farahpahlavi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was an accomplished athlete in her youth and became captain of her school's basketball team.  Upon finishing her studies at the [[Razi High School|Lycée Razi]], she pursued an interest in architecture at the [[École Spéciale d'Architecture]] in [[Paris]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=8NIwBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA93&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;dq=farah+diba+studied+architecture+at+the+Ecole+sp%C3%A9ciale+d'architecture&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kovbhEnTXQ&amp;sig=Wi2o03DAsyhT7h2Tx72NxxvQQ2Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjLvta0-KzXAhXC0hoKHZIdBSYQ6AEIOTAH#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Translation, History and Arts: New Horizons in Asian Interdisciplinary Humanities Research|last=Meng|first=J. I.|date=2013-07-29|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=9781443851176|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; where she was a student of [[Albert Besson]].

Many Iranian students who were studying abroad at this time were dependent on State sponsorship. Therefore, when the [[Shah]], as head of state, made official visits to foreign countries, he frequently met with a selection of local Iranian students.  It was during such a meeting in 1959 at the Iranian Embassy in [[Paris]] that Farah Diba was first presented to Mohammed Reza Pahlavi.

After returning to Tehran in the summer of 1959, the Shah and Farah Diba began a carefully choreographed courtship, orchestrated in part by the Shah's daughter [[Shahnaz Pahlavi|Princess Shahnaz]]. The couple announced their engagement on 23 November 1959.

==Marriage and family==
[[File:Portrait officiel de la famille impériale d'Iran (1978).jpg|thumb|Farah with her family in 1978]]
[[File:CoronationShahanshahShahbanou.jpg|thumb|left|Mohammad Reza crowned Farah, 26 October 1967]]
Farah Diba married [[Mohammed Reza Pahlavi|Shah Mohammed Reza]] on 20 December 1959, aged 21.  The young Queen of Iran (as she was [[Style (manner of address)|styled]] at the time) was the object of much curiosity and her wedding received worldwide press attention. Her gown was designed by [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]], then a designer at the house of [[Dior]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orderofsplendor.blogspot.com/2012/02/wedding-wednesday-empress-farahs-gown.html|title=The Royal Order of Sartorial Splendor: Wedding Wednesday: Empress Farah's Gown|work=orderofsplendor.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she wore the newly commissioned [[Noor-ol-Ain Diamond]] [[tiara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=gO9nBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA176&amp;dq=farah+diba+noor-ol-ain+tiara&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiGjuC8urTXAhULfhoKHWVeCxcQ6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=farah%20diba%20noor-ol-ain%20tiara&amp;f=false|title=World Clothing and Fashion: An Encyclopedia of History, Culture, and Social Influence|last=Snodgrass|first=Mary Ellen|date=2015-03-17|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317451679|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the pomp and celebrations associated with the imperial wedding, the success of this union became contingent upon the queen's ability to produce a male heir. Although he had been married twice before, the Shah's previous marriages had given him only a daughter who, under [[agnatic primogeniture]], could not inherit the throne. The pressure for the young queen was acute.  The shah himself was deeply anxious to have a male heir as were the members of his government.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Pahlavi, Farah. 'An Enduring Love: My Life with The Shah. A Memoir', 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, it was known that the dissolution of the Shah's previous marriage to [[Soraya Esfandiary-Bakhtiary|Queen Soraya]] had been due to her infertility.&lt;ref&gt;Queen of Iran Accepts Divorce As Sacrifice, The New York Times, 15 March 1958, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The couple had four children:

* Crown Prince [[Reza Pahlavi, Crown Prince of Iran|Reza Pahlavi]] of Iran (born 31 October 1960)
* Princess [[Farahnaz Pahlavi]] of Iran (born 12 March 1963)
* Prince [[Ali Reza Pahlavi II|Ali Reza Pahlavi]] of Iran (28 April 1966 – 4 January 2011)
* Princess [[Leila Pahlavi]] of Iran (27 March 1970 – 10 June 2001)

==As Queen and Empress==
[[File:Fpkermanshah.jpg|thumb|Shahbanu Farah Pahlavi visits [[Kermanshah]]]]
[[File:Empress Farah Office.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Shahbanu]]'' Farah at work in her office in [[Tehran]], 1970s.]]
The exact role the new Queen would play, if any, in public or government affairs, was uncertain with her main role being simply to give the Shah a male heir.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Zonis, Marvin ''Majestic Failure The Fall of the Shah'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1991 page 138.&lt;/ref&gt;  Within the Imperial Household, her public function was secondary to the far more pressing matter of assuring the succession.  However, after the birth of the Crown Prince, the new Queen was free to devote more of her time to other activities and official pursuits. Mohammad Reza was always very attracted to tall women and Farah was taller than her husband, which led him to wear [[elevator shoes]] to disguise this fact.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Zonis, Marvin ''Majestic Failure The Fall of the Shah'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1991 page 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Usually when the Imperial couple were photographed, one or both would be sitting in a chair or alternatively the Shah and his Queen were photographed on a staircase with Mohammad Reza standing on the upper stairs.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Like many other Royal consorts, the young Queen initially limited herself to a ceremonial role. In 1961 during a visit to France, the [[Francophile]] Farah befriended the French culture minister [[André Malraux]], leading her to arrange the exchange of cultural artifacts between French and Iranian art galleries and museums, a lively trade that continued until the Islamic revolution of 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Milani, Abbas ''The Shah'', London: Macmillan, 2011 page 279&lt;/ref&gt; Farah and Mohammad Reza usually spoke French rather than Farsi to their children.&lt;ref&gt;Milani, Abbas ''The Shah'', London: Macmillan, 2011 page 347&lt;/ref&gt; She spent much of her time attending the openings of various education and health-care institutions without venturing too deeply into controversial issues.  However, as time progressed, this position changed. The Queen became much more actively involved in government affairs where it concerned issues and causes that interested her.  She used her proximity and influence with her husband, the [[Shah]], to secure funding and focus attention on causes, particularly in the areas of women's rights and cultural development.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Farah's concerns were the "realms of education, health, culture and social matters" with politics being excluded from her purview.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; However, Mohammad Reza's politically powerful twin sister Princess Ashraf came to see Farah as a rival. It was the rivalry with Princess Ashraf that led Farah to press her husband into reducing her influence at the Court.&lt;ref&gt;Zonis, Marvin ''Majestic Failure The Fall of the Shah'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1991 page 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Farah Pahlavi with crown.jpg|thumb|Empress Farah after her coronation]]
One of the Empress Farah's main initiatives was founding [[Pahlavi University]], which was meant to improve the education of Iranian women, and was the first American style university in Iran; before then, Iranian universities had always been modeled on the French style.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The Empress wrote in 1978 that her duties were:

[[File:Photograph of First Lady Betty Ford with the Shahbanou (Empress) of Iran on the Steps Leading to the Truman Balcony... - NARA - 186813.tif|thumb|left|190px|U.S. First Lady [[Betty Ford]] (left) with Farah Pahlavi, 1975]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;I could not write in detail of all the organizations over which I preside and in which I take a very active part, in the realms of education, health, culture and social matters. It would need a further book. A simple list would perhaps give some idea: the Organization for Family Well Being-nurseries for the children of working mothers, teaching women and girls to read, professional training, family planning; the Organization for Blood Transfusion; the Organization for the Fight Against Cancer; the Organization for Help to the Needy, the Health Organization ... the Children's Centre; the Centre for the Intellectual Development of Children ... the Imperial Institute of Philosophy; the Foundation for Iranian Culture; the Festival of Shiraz, the Tehran Cinema Festival; the Iranian Folklore Organization; the Asiatic Institute; the Civilisations Discussion Centre; the Pahlavi University; the Academy of Sciences.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Farah worked long hours at her charitable activities, from about 9 am to 9 pm every weekday.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  Eventually, the Queen came to preside over a staff of 40 who handled various requests for assistance on a range of issues. She became one of the most highly visible figures in the Imperial Government and the patron of 24 educational, health and cultural organizations.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Her humanitarian role earned her immense popularity for a time, particularly in the early 1970s.&lt;ref name="time.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,945049-2,00.html| work=Time|title=The World: Farah: The Working Empress|date=4 November 1974|accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, she travelled a great deal within Iran, visiting some of the more remote parts of the country and meeting with the local citizens.
Her significance was exemplified by her part in the 1967 Coronation Ceremonies, where she was crowned as the first ''[[shahbanu]]'' (empress) of modern Iran. It was again confirmed when the Shah named her as the official [[regent]] should he die or be incapacitated before the Crown Prince's 21st birthday. The naming of a woman as regent was highly unusual for a Middle Eastern or Muslim monarchy.&lt;ref name="time.com"/&gt; The great wealth generated by Iran's oil encouraged a sense of Iranian nationalism at the Imperial Court. The Empress Farah recalled of her days as a university student in 1950s France about being asked where she was from:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When I told them Iran ... the Europeans would recoil in horror as if Iranians were barbarians and loathsome. But after Iran became wealthy under the Shah in the 1970s, Iranians were courted everywhere. Yes, Your Majesty. Of course, Your Majesty. If you please, Your Majesty. Fawning all over us. Greedy sycophants. Then they loved Iranians.&lt;ref&gt;Zonis, Marvin ''Majestic Failure The Fall of the Shah'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1991 page 221.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Contributions to art and culture==

[[File:Roudaki Hall opening, Shah and R.E. Warren.jpg|thumb|Shah and Shahbanu opens [[Roudaki Hall]]]]
From the beginning of her reign, the Empress took an active interest in promoting culture and the arts in Iran.  Through her patronage, numerous organizations were created and fostered to further her ambition of bringing historical and contemporary Iranian Art to prominence both inside Iran and in the Western world.

In addition to her own efforts, the Empress sought to achieve this goal with the assistance of various foundations and advisers. Her ministry encouraged many forms of artistic expression, including traditional Iranian arts (such as weaving, singing, and poetry recital) as well as Western theatre. Her most recognized endeavour supporting the performing arts was her patronage of the [[Shiraz Arts Festival]]. This occasionally controversial event was held annually from 1967 until 1977 and featured live performances by both Iranian and Western artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/leon.2007.40.1.20 |title=The Shiraz Arts Festival: Western Avant-Garde Arts in 1970s Iran |author=Robert Gluck |website=Mitpressjournals.org |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of her time, however, went into the creation of museums and the building of their collections.

As a former architecture student, the Empress's appreciation of it is demonstrated in the [[Niavaran Complex|Royal Palace of Niavaran]], designed by Mohsen Foroughi, and completed in 1968: it mixes traditional Iranian architecture with 1960's contemporary design. Nearby is the personal library of the Empress, consisting of 22,000 books, comprising principally works on Western and Eastern art, philosophy and religion; the interior was designed by Aziz Farmanfarmayan.

===Ancient art===
Historically a culturally rich country, the Iran of the 1960s had little to show for it. Many of the great artistic treasures produced during its 2,500-year history had found their way into the hands of foreign museums and private collections. It became one of the Empress's principal goals to procure for Iran an appropriate collection of its own historic artifacts. To that end, she secured from her husband's government permission and funds to "buy back" a wide selection of Iranian artifacts from foreign and domestic collections. This was achieved with the help of the brothers Houshang and Mehdi Mahboubian, the most prominent Iranian antiquities dealers of the era, who advised the Empress from 1972 to 1978.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art-market-mysterious-gifts-from-the-east-who-is-the-man-who-has-collected-islams-finest-treasures-and-offered-them-to-britain-as-a-pounds-1bn-bequest-geraldine-norman-finds-out-1563284.html|work=The Independent|location=London|title=Mysterious gifts from the East| date=13 December 1992|accessdate=16 March 2012|first=Geraldine|last=Norman}}&lt;/ref&gt; With these artifacts she founded several national museums (many of which still survive to this day) and began an Iranian version of the [[National Trust]].&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2005/oct/07/art.iran|work=The Guardian| location=London|title=Lifting the veil|date=7 October 2005|accessdate=2 May 2010|first=Christopher|last=de Bellaigue}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Museums and cultural centres created under her guidance include the Negarestan Cultural Center, the [[Reza Abbasi Museum]], the [[Khorramabad]] Museum with its valuable collection of [[Lorestān bronze]]s, the [[Carpet Museum of Iran|National Carpet Gallery]] and the [[Abgineh Museum of Tehran|Glassware and Ceramic Museum of Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;Pahlavi, Farah.

===Contemporary art===
[[File:Farah Pahlavi in Sabzevar 3.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Farah Pahlavi in Jame Mosque of [[Sabzevar]]]]
Aside from building a collection of historic Iranian artifacts, the Empress also expressed interest in acquiring contemporary Western and Iranian art. To this end, she put her significant patronage behind the [[Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art]]. The fruits of her work in founding and expanding that institution are perhaps the Empress' most enduring cultural legacy to the people of Iran.

Using funds allocated from the Government, the Empress took advantage of a somewhat depressed art market of the 1970s to purchase several important works of Western art. Under her guidance,{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} the Museum acquired nearly 150 works by such artists as [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Claude Monet]], [[George Grosz]], [[Andy Warhol]], [[Jackson Pollock]], and [[Roy Lichtenstein]]. Today, the collection of the [[Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art]] is widely considered to be one of the most significant outside Europe and the United States. According to [[Parviz Tanavoli]], a modern Iranian sculptor and a former Cultural Adviser to the Empress, that the impressive collection was amassed for "tens, not hundreds, of millions of dollars".&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"/&gt; Today, the value of these holdings are conservatively estimated to be near US$2.8 billion.&lt;ref name="abcnews.go.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=4406991&amp;page=1|title=Iran: We Will Put American Art Treasures on Display|publisher=ABC News|date=7 March 2008|accessdate=11 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection created a conundrum for the anti-western [[Islamic Revolution|Islamic Republic]] which took power after the fall of the [[Pahlavi Dynasty]] in 1979. Although politically the fundamentalist government rejected Western influence in Iran, the Western art collection amassed by the Empress was retained, most likely due to its enormous value. It was, nevertheless, not publicly displayed and spent nearly two decades in storage in the vaults of the [[Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art]]. This caused much speculation as to the fate of the artwork which was only put to rest after a large portion of the collection was briefly seen again in an exhibition that took place in Tehran during September 2005.&lt;ref name="abcnews.go.com"/&gt;

==Iranian Revolution==
[[File:Farah pahlavi-125462.jpg|thumb|Picture of ''[[Shahbanu]]'' Farah defaced by anti-Pahlavi protesters]]
{{further|Iranian Revolution|Causes of the Iranian Revolution}}
In Iran by early 1978, a number of factors contributed to the internal dissatisfaction with the [[Pahlavi Dynasty|Imperial Government]] becoming more pronounced.

Discontent within the country continued to escalate and later in the year led to demonstrations against the monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/5/newsid_2538000/2538427.stm|work=BBC News| title=1978: Iran's PM steps down amid riots|date=5 November 1978|accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pahlavi wrote in her memoirs that during this time "there was an increasingly palpable sense of unease". Under these circumstances most of the Shahbanu's official activities were cancelled due to concerns for her safety.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

As the year came to a close, the political situation deteriorated further.  Riots and unrest grew more frequent, culminating in January 1979. The government enacted [[martial law]] in most major Iranian cities and the country was on the verge of an open revolution.

It was at this time, in response to the violent protests, that Mohammad Reza and Farah decided to leave the country. They both departed Iran via aircraft on 16 January 1979.

==After leaving Iran==
The question of where the Shah and Shahbanu would go after leaving Iran was the subject of some debate, even between the monarch and his advisers.&lt;ref&gt;Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Answer to History, Stein &amp; Day Pub, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; During his reign, Mohammad Reza had maintained close relations with [[Egypt]]ian President [[Anwar Sadat]] and Farah had developed a close friendship with the President's wife, [[Jehan Sadat]]. The Egyptian President extended an invitation to the Imperial Couple for asylum in Egypt which they accepted.

[[File:Mohammed Reza Pahlavi and his wife.jpg|thumb|[[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], The Shah of Iran, and his wife, Empress Farah, wave goodbye prior to boarding an aircraft after a visit to the [[United States-Iran relations|United States]].]]
Due to the political situation unfolding in Iran, many governments, including those which had been on friendly terms with the [[Pahlavi dynasty|Iranian Monarchy]] prior to the revolution, saw the Shah's presence within their borders as a liability.  The [[History of the Islamic Republic of Iran|Revolutionary Government]] in Iran had ordered the arrest (and later death) of both the Shah and the Shahbanu.  The new Iranian Government would go on to vehemently demand their extradition a number of times but the extent to which it would act in pressuring foreign powers for the deposed monarch's return (and presumably that of the Empress) was at that time unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=Time Magazine|title=Shah's Dilemma|url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,947015,00.html?promoid=googlep}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Imperial couple were aware of the potential danger which their presence carried to their hosts. In response, they left Egypt, beginning a fourteen-month long search for permanent asylum and a journey which took them through many  countries.  After [[Egypt]], they traveled to [[Morocco]], where they were briefly the guests of [[Hassan II of Morocco|King Hassan II]].

After leaving [[Morocco]], the Shah and Empress were granted temporary refuge in the [[Bahamas]]. After their Bahamian visas expired and were not renewed, they made an appeal to Mexico, which was granted, and rented a villa in [[Cuernavaca]] near [[Mexico City]].

===Shah's illness===
[[File:Shah Farah Leave.jpg|thumb|left|The Shah and Shahbanu Farah shortly before leaving Iran in 1979]]
After leaving Egypt the Shah's health began a rapid decline due to a long-term battle with [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]]. The seriousness of that illness brought the now exiled Imperial couple briefly to the [[United States]] in search of medical treatment. The couple's presence in the United States further inflamed the already tense relations between [[Washington D.C.|Washington]] and the revolutionaries in [[Tehran]]. The Shah's stay in the US, although for medical purposes, became the tipping point for renewed hostilities between the two nations. These events ultimately led to the attack and takeover of the American Embassy in Tehran in what became known as the [[Iran hostage crisis]].

Under these difficult circumstances, the Shah and Empress were not given permission to remain in the United States.  Shortly after receiving basic medical attention, the couple again departed for [[Latin America]], although this time the destination was [[Contadora Island]] in [[Panama]].

By now, both the Shah and Empress viewed the [[Jimmy Carter|Carter Administration]] with some antipathy in response to a lack of support and were initially pleased to leave.  That attitude, however soured as speculation arose that the [[Panama]]nian Government was seeking to arrest the Shah in preparation for extradition to Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=Time Magazine|title= The Shah's Flight|url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,921924-2,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under these conditions the Shah and Empress again made an appeal to President Anwar Sadat to return to Egypt (for her part Empress Farah writes that this plea was made through a conversation between herself and Jehan Sadat). Their request was granted and they returned to [[Egypt]] in March 1980, where they remained until the Shah's death four months later on 27 July 1980.

==Life in exile==
[[File:Farah Pahlavi 2016-03-12.JPG|thumb|Farah Pahlavi in [[Washington D.C.]] in 2016]]
After the Shah's death, the exiled Shahbanu remained in Egypt for nearly two years. [[Anwar El Sadat|President Anwar Sadat]] gave her and her family use of [[Koubbeh Palace]] in Cairo. A few months after President Sadat's [[Assassination of Anwar Sadat|assassination]] in October 1981, the Shahbanu and her family left Egypt. President [[Ronald Reagan]] informed her that she was welcome in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Pahlavi, Farah. "An Enduring Love: My life with Shah. A Memoir" 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

She first settled in [[Williamstown, Massachusetts]], but later bought a home in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]].  After the death of her daughter [[Leila Pahlavi|Princess Leila]] in 2001, she purchased a smaller home in [[Potomac, Maryland]], near [[Washington, D.C.]], to be closer to her son and grandchildren. Farah now divides her time between [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[Paris]]. She also makes an annual July pilgrimage to the late Shah's [[mausoleum]] at Cairo's [[al-Rifa'i Mosque]].

Farah supports charities, including the Annual Alzheimer Gala IFRAD (International Fund Raising for Alzheimer Disease) held in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/07/mar/1060.html|title=Enduring Friendship: Alain Delon and Shahbanou Farah Pahlavi at annual Alzheimer Gala in Paris|publisher=Payvand|accessdate=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farah Pahlavi continues to appear at certain international royal events, such as the 2004 wedding of [[Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark]], the 2010 wedding of [[Prince Nikolaos of Greece and Denmark]], the 2011 wedding of [[Albert II, Prince of Monaco]] and the 2016 wedding of [[Crown Prince Leka II of Albania]].

===Grandchildren===
Farah Pahlavi currently has three grandchildren (granddaughters) through her son [[Reza Pahlavi, Crown Prince of Iran]] and his wife [[Yasmine Pahlavi|Yasmine]].

===Memoir===
In 2003, Farah Pahlavi wrote a book about her marriage to Mohammad Reza entitled ''[[An Enduring Love: My Life with the Shah]]''.  The publication of the former Empress's memoirs attracted international interest. It was a best-seller in Europe, with excerpts appearing in news magazines and the author appearing on talk shows and in other media outlets. However, opinion about the book, which ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' called "a candid, straightforward account" and ''the [[Washington Post]]'' called "engrossing", was mixed.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[Elaine Sciolino]], ''[[The New York Times]]'''s Paris bureau chief, gave the book a less than flattering review, describing it as "well translated" but "full of anger and bitterness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Elaine |last=Sciolino|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/02/books/the-last-empress.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|title=The Last Empress|newspaper= The New York Times|date= 2 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; But ''[[National Review|National Review's]]'' [[Reza Bayegan]], an Iranian writer, praised the memoir as "abound[ing] with affection and sympathy for her countrymen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Reza |last=Bayegan|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/210633/shah-she/reza-bayegan|title=The Shah &amp; She|publisher= National Review|date=13 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Documentaries and theater play===
In 2009 the Persian-Swedish director [[Nahid Persson Sarvestani]] released a [[feature film|feature length]] documentary about Farah Pahlavi's life, entitled ''[[The Queen and I (film)|The Queen and I]]''. The film was screened in various International film festivals such as [[International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam|IDFA]] and  [[Sundance Film Festival|Sundance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.sundance.org/films/5861|title=The Queen and I|work=sundance.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 the Dutch director Kees Roorda made a theater play inspired by the life of Farah Pahlavi in exile. In the play Liz Snoijink acted as Farah Diba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Farah Diba, World's Prettiest Woman: Premiere in Haarlem|url=http://iranian.com/main/blog/pejman7/premiere-farah-diba-holland|publisher= iranian.com|year= 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frederic Bertley''' is a Canadian [[scientist]], [[science educator]] and [[immunologist]].

Bertley became the president and CEO of COSI Columbus in Columbus, Ohio, on Jan. 1, 2017.
 
In 2008, Bertley joined [[The Franklin Institute]] in [[Philadelphia]] as Vice President. From 2012 to 2016, he held the role of the Senior Vice President of Science and Education, overseeing a diverse portfolio of initiatives supporting innovation in STEM learning, as well as departments and programs that maintain the history and legacy of the Franklin Institute.&lt;ref name="Senior Staff"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bertley|first1=Frederic|title=Senior Staff|url=https://www.fi.edu/scientists/frederic-bertley-phd|website=www.fi.edu|accessdate=4 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the support of the Franklin Institute, Bertley focused on improving the quality of science education worldwide and furthering science literacy for the non-scientist adult population.  There, he oversaw departments such as gender and adult learning, community engagement, youth programs, professional development, and learning technologies—as well as the institute's prestigious [[Franklin Institute Awards]] Program, the oldest comprehensive science awards program in the nation; and is also the executive editor of the ''[[Journal of the Franklin Institute]]'', the second oldest scientific journal in the United States. Bertley was the driving force behind the Franklin Institute's collaborative efforts to improve the global education landscape, primarily in Egypt through a USAID-funded program managed by [[World Learning]], in partnership with the Franklin Institute, the 21st Century Partnership for STEM Education, and the Teaching Institute for Excellence in STEM.&lt;ref name="WL"&gt;{{cite web |title= World Learning |url= http://www.worldlearning.org/what-we-do/education-consortium-for-the-advancement-of-stem-in-egypt/ |website= www.worldlearning.org |accessdate= 14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="21pstem"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Taylor |first1=Dave |title= The Greater Philadelphia STEAM Initiative |url= http://21pstem.org/projects/steam-initiative/ |accessdate= 14 September 2016 |agency= The 21st Century Partnership for STEM Education |date= 21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Bertley founded ''The Color of Science&amp;trade;'', a program that honors the superb contributions of underrepresented groups, including women and persons of color each year.  The program is designed to specifically promote and showcase diversity within the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics ([[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]]) arenas locally and nationally.  It includes a live monthly radio talk show hosted by Bertley, a traveling panel exhibit, and a two-day public event that brings esteemed STEM experts together to relate their stories, celebrate their achievements, and demonstrate to the next generation the variety of opportunities available in STEM-related fields.

Bertley's background in [[applied science]] and [[science education]] have led him to generate ways of distilling complex scientific principles into more easily digestible concepts for a wide and inclusive audience.&lt;ref name="AlDia"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gamboa|first1=Ana|title=Take a walk on the wild side of Franklin Institute|url=http://aldianews.com/articles/local/philadelphia/take-walk-wild-side-franklin-institute/35785|accessdate=7 September 2016|publisher=AL DÍA News|date=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appears frequently on local and national networks including NBC, ABC, CBS, PBS, and FOX.&lt;ref name="Senior Staff"/&gt;

== Education ==
As an undergraduate, Bertley studied [[physiology]], [[mathematics]], and the [[history of science]]. He obtained both his bachelor's degree in science (1994) and his Ph.D. in [[immunology]] (1999) from [[McGill University]], and then completed his post-doctoral fellowship at [[Harvard Medical School]] (2003).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Institute|first1=Franklin|title=Senior Vice President of Science and Education|url=https://www.fi.edu/scientists/frederic-bertley-phd|website=www.fi.edu|accessdate=4 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from McGill, he turned his attention to the lack of [[primary healthcare]], [[preventative medicine]], and basic [[vaccines]] in developing nations where he managed multinational teams in [[Haiti]], [[Sudan]], and [[Canadian Arctic]]. He continued this focus by joining a vaccine research group at [[Harvard Medical School]] focusing on the development of [[DNA]] vaccines for [[HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;Reporter,McGill.

'''Frederika "Friedl" Dicker-Brandeis''' (30 July 1898 Vienna – 9 October 1944 Auschwitz-Birkenau), was an Austrian artist and educator murdered by the [[Nazis]] in the [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]] [[extermination camp]] .

==Biography==
'''Frederika Dicker''' was born in Vienna on 30 July 1898. She married Pavel Brandeis in 1936 and used the double-barrelled surname after that. Dicker-Brandeis was a student of [[Johannes Itten]] at his private school in [[Vienna]], and later followed Itten to study and teach at the [[Weimar]] [[Bauhaus]]. She was involved in the textile design, printmaking, bookbinding, and typography workshops there from 1919-1923. After leaving the Bauhaus, she worked as an artist and textile designer in [[Berlin]], [[Prague]], and [[Hronov]]. Dicker-Brandeis wrote to a friend in 1940:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/10/arts/design/10SALA.html Keeping Creativity Alive, Even in Hell] By [[Julie Salamon|JULIE SALAMON]]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|I remember thinking in school how I would grow up and would protect my students from unpleasant impressions, from uncertainty, from scrappy learning... Today only one thing seems important — to rouse the desire towards creative work, to make it a habit, and to teach how to overcome difficulties that are insignificant in comparison with the goal to which you are striving.}}

==In World War II==
Dicker-Brandeis and her husband were deported to the [[Theresienstadt concentration camp|Terezín]] "model ghetto" in December 1942. During her time at Terezín, she gave art lessons and lectures.
She helped to organize secret education classes for the children of Terezín. She saw drawing and art as a way for the children to understand their emotions and their environment. In this capacity, she was giving art therapy.

At Terezin, she persisted in pursuing her goal — ''"to rouse the desire towards creative work."'' &lt;ref&gt;taken from the above mentioned article of Julie Salamon&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1944, Brandeis was transported to [[Auschwitz]]; Dicker-Brandeis volunteered for the next transport to join him. But before she was taken away, she gave to [[Raja Engländerova]], the chief tutor of Girls' Home L 410, two suitcases with 4,500 drawings.

F. Dicker-Brandeis died in [[Auschwitz II|Birkenau]] on 9 October 1944.&lt;ref name="Sterling"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sterling|first=Eric|title=Life in the ghettos during the Holocaust|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ywZG1TwqHwoC&amp;pg=PA196&amp;dq=%22Friedl+Dicker-Brandeis%22+auschwitz&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=LweCTbf_LMbpgQfZ-tXfCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Friedl%20Dicker-Brandeis%22%20auschwitz&amp;f=false|year=2005|publisher=[[Syracuse University Press]]|isbn=978-0-8156-0803-5|page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her husband Pavel, survived.

==Legacy==
After the war, [[Willy Groag]], the director of the Girls' home L 410 brought the suitcases with children's drawings to the Jewish Community in Prague. From the nearly 660 authors of the drawings, 550 were killed in the Holocaust. The drawings are now in the [[Jewish Museum in Prague]]'s collection, with some on display in the [[Pinkas Synagogue]] in Prague.

In 1999, a Friedl Dicker-Brandeis exhibition, organized by the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] and curated by Elena Makarova of Israel, opened in Vienna. The exhibition was shown in Czech Republic, Germany, Sweden, France, USA, and Japan. Tokyo Fuji Art Museum founder [[Daisaku Ikeda]], who was instrumental in bringing the exhibit to Japan, commented:{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

{{Quote|The various artworks left behind by this great woman and the children of Terezin are their legacy to the present, to all of us today. They demand that we continue in our quest for a society that truly treasures human life, transcending all differences of race, religion, politics and ideology. It remains my heartfelt hope that this exhibit may provide a moment of introspection for its viewers, a moment for us to reaffirm the importance of our rights as human beings and the value of life itself.}}

'''John George Rapp''' ({{lang-de|Johann Georg Rapp}}; November 1, 1757 in [[Iptingen]], [[Duchy of Württemberg]] – August 7, 1847 in [[Ambridge, Pennsylvania|Economy, Pennsylvania]]) was the founder of the religious sect called Harmonists, Harmonites, Rappites, or the [[Harmony Society]].

Born in [[Iptingen]], [[Duchy of Württemberg]], [[Germany]], Rapp became inspired by the philosophies of [[Jakob Böhme]], [[Philipp Jakob Spener]], and [[Emanuel Swedenborg]], among others.  In the 1780s, George Rapp began preaching and soon started to gather a group of his own followers.  His group officially split with the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran Church]] in 1785 and was promptly banned from meeting.  The persecution that Rapp and his followers experienced caused them to leave Germany and come to the [[United States]] in 1803.&lt;ref name="Sutton1"&gt;Robert Paul Sutton, ''Communal Utopias and the American Experience: Religious Communities'' (2003) p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;  Rapp was a [[Pietism|Pietist]], and a number of his beliefs were shared by the [[Anabaptist]]s, as well as groups such as the [[Shakers]].

Rapp's religious beliefs and philosophy were the cement that held his community together both in Germany and in America – a [[Christian]] community and [[Commune (intentional community)|commune]], which in America organized as the [[Harmony Society]].  The Harmony Society built three American towns, became rich, famous, and survived for 100 years – roughly from 1805 until 1905.

==George Rapp and the Harmony Society==

In 1791, George Rapp said, "I am a prophet and I am called to be one" in front of the civil affairs official in [[Maulbronn]], [[Germany]], who promptly had him imprisoned for two days and threatened with [[exile]] if he did not cease preaching.&lt;ref name="Arndt1"&gt;Karl J. R. Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society, 1785-1847'' (Rutherford, N.J.: Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 1972)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pitzer1"&gt;Donald E. Pitzer, ''America's Communal Utopias'' (University of North Carolina, 1997) p.57&lt;/ref&gt; To the great consternation of church and state authorities, this peasant from [[Iptingen]] had become the outspoken leader of several thousand [[Separatism|Separatists]] in the southern German duchy of [[Württemberg]].&lt;ref name="Sutton1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Arndt1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pitzer1"/&gt;  In 1798, Rapp and his group of followers had further distanced themselves from mainstream society.  In the Lomersheimer Declaration, written in 1798, Rapp's followers refused to serve in the military or attend [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] schools.  By 1802, the Separatists had grown in number to about 12,000 and the Württemberg government decided that they were a dangerous threat to social order.&lt;ref name="Sutton1"/&gt;  Rapp was summoned to Maulbronn for an interrogation and the government confiscated Separatist books.&lt;ref name="Sutton1"/&gt;  When released in 1803, Rapp told his followers to pool their assets and follow him on a journey for safety to the "land of Israel" in the [[United States]], and soon over 800 people were living with him there.&lt;ref name="Sutton1"/&gt;

The initial move scattered the followers and reduced Rapp's original group of 12,000 to many fewer persons.  In 1804, Rapp was able to secure a large tract of land in [[Pennsylvania]] and started his first [[commune (intentional community)|commune]].  This first commune, 'Harmonie', ([[Harmony, Pennsylvania|Harmony]]), [[Butler County, Pennsylvania]], soon grew to a population of about 800, and was highly profitable.  At Harmony, the [[Harmony Society]] was formally organized on February 15, 1805, and its members contracted to hold all property in common and to submit to spiritual and material leadership by Rapp and associates.  In 1807, [[celibacy]] was advocated as the preferred custom of the community in an attempt to purify themselves for the coming [[Millennialism|Millennium]].

In 1814, the society sold their first town in Pennsylvania to [[Mennonite]]s for 10 times the amount originally paid for the land, and the entire commune moved out west to [[Indiana]] where their new town was also known as Harmony. Ten years after the move to Indiana the commune moved again, this time it returned to [[Pennsylvania]] and named their town 'Ökonomie', [[Old Economy Village|Economy]]. The Indiana settlement was sold to [[Robert Owen]], at which point it was renamed [[New Harmony, Indiana]].

George Rapp lived out his remaining days in the town of [[Old Economy Village|Economy, Pennsylvania]], until August 7, 1847, when he died at the age of 89.

==Early life and family==
[[File:Iptingen Kirche.JPG|thumb|upright|Church at Iptingen, Rapp's home village]]
Johann Georg Rapp was born on November 1, 1757, to Rosine Berger and Hans Adam Rapp (1720–71)  in the village of [[Iptingen]], {{convert|25|mi|km}} northwest of [[Stuttgart]] in the [[Duchy of Württemberg]]. Rapp was the second child an oldest son of the family. His brother, Adam (born on March 9, 1762), and three sisters, Marie Dorothea (born October 11, 1756), Elise Dorothea (born August 7, 1760), and Maria Barbara (born October 21, 1765) later followed him to America; however, Adam died at sea.&lt;ref name=Arndt15-17&gt;{{cite book | author= Karl J. R.

Elliott | title = New Harmony’s First Utopians, 1814-1924 | journal =Indiana Magazine of History | volume =75 | issue =3 | pages=227  | publisher =Indiana University | location =Bloomington | date =September 1979| url =https://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/imh/article/view/10180| accessdate =August 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Rapp learned the art of wine making from his father, a farmer. After his father's death in 1771, Rapp trained as a journeyman weaver. He also developed an interest in preaching.&lt;ref name=Arndt15-17/&gt; Vineyards and textiles would become a part of the agricultural, manufacturing, and commercial economy in all three of the Harmonite towns that were later founded in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Pitzer and Elliott, "New Harmony's First Utopians, 1814-1924,", pp. 233–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 4, 1783, Rapp married Christine Benzinger of Fiolzheim. The couple had two children, a son, Johannes (December 22, 1783 – 1812), and a daughter, Rosine (February 10, 1786 – 1849).&lt;ref name=Arndt15-17/&gt; Johannes, who trained as a surveyor, died at the age of twenty-nine in an industrial accident. Johannes's name is the only one listed on a stone in the Harmonist cemetery in [[Harmony, Pennsylvania]]. (The Harmonists did not mark their graves.) The marker was donated by non-Harmonists and the [[Harmony Society|Society]] accepted it reluctantly. The specific location of Johannes's gravesite within the cemetery is unknown. Johannes's daughter, Gertrude (1808–89), later became a minor American celebrity and organized the Society's silk production at [[Ambridge, Pennsylvania|Economy, Pennsylvania]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} George Rapp later adopted Frederick Reichert (April 12, 1775 – June 24, 1834).&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, pp. 52, 122, and 531.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Frederick Reichert, Rapp’s adopted son, organized the relocation of Rapp's followers from Württemberg to [[Pennsylvania]] in 1804 and supervised the immigration of other Rappites to the United States. Reichert, who became known as Frederick Rapp, was the business leader and public spokesman for the [[Harmony Society]], drew up the town plan for its new village at [[New Harmony, Indiana#Harmonist settlement (1814–1824)|New Harmony, Indiana]], in 1814, and served as one of the delegates to the [[Indiana Territory]]'s [[Constitution of Indiana#Constitutional Convention|Constitutional Convention]] in 1816. Frederick Rapp also helped choose the site for the permanent seat of government of Indiana in 1820 that was later named [[Indianapolis]] and held leadership roles in several Indiana banks. After the Harmonists sold their Indiana land in 1824, he relocated with other members of the Society to [[Ambridge, Pennsylvania|Economy, Pennsylvania]], where he died in 1834.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, pp. 173, 165, 178 –79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=James H.

George Rapp was tall, blue eyed, broad shouldered, with long hair and a patriarch's beard.  He had a powerful voice, which matched his commanding presence.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

==Religious views==

[[File:Harmony Pennsylvania 1833.png|thumb|Map of Harmony (1833).]]
Rapp and his followers, the [[Harmony Society|Harmonites]], believed [[Christ]] would return in their lifetime.  The purpose of the community was to be worthy of Christ and prepare for his return.  They were [[nonviolence|nonviolent]] [[Pacifism|pacifists]], refused to serve in the military, and tried to live by George Rapp's philosophy and literal interpretations of the [[New Testament]].  After leaving [[Germany]] and coming to the [[United States]], they first settled in (and built) the town of [[Harmony, Pennsylvania]] in 1804, and established the Harmony Society in 1805 as a religious [[Commune (intentional community)|commune]].  In 1807, [[celibacy]] was advocated as the preferred custom of the community in an attempt to purify themselves for the coming [[Millennialism|Millennium]].  Rapp believed that the events and wars going on in the world at the time were a confirmation of his views regarding the imminent [[Second Coming|Second Coming of Christ]], and he also viewed [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] as the [[Antichrist]].&lt;ref name="Baumgartner"&gt;Frederic J. Baumgartner, ''Longing for the End: A History of Millennialism in Western Civilization'' (1999) p.166&lt;/ref&gt;  Rapp produced a book with his ideas and philosophy, ''Thoughts on the Destiny of Man'', published in German in 1824 and in English a year later.

[[Image:Sophia design.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Sophia (wisdom)|Virgin Sophia]] design on doorway in [[Harmony, Pennsylvania]], carved by Frederick Reichert Rapp (1775-1834).]]
The Harmonites were [[Millennialism|Millennialists]], in that they believed [[Jesus]] [[Christ]] was coming to earth in their lifetime to help usher in a thousand-year kingdom of peace on earth.  This is perhaps why they believed that people should try to make themselves "pure" and "perfect", and share things with others while willingly living in [[Commune (intentional community)|communal]] "harmony" ([[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] [[Christian communism#Early Christian Communism|4:32-37]]) and practicing [[celibacy]].  They believed that the old ways of life on earth were coming to an end, and that a new perfect kingdom on earth was about to be realized. They practiced [[socialism]] within their community, but traded their exotic agricultural goods, including lemons and figs grown in movable greenhouses, with others.&lt;ref&gt;Rode, Silvia.

Rapp and his group also practiced forms of [[Esoteric Christianity]], [[Mysticism]] ([[Christian mysticism]]), and Rapp often spoke of the [[Virginity|virgin]] [[spirit]] or [[Goddess#Christianity|Goddess]] named [[Sophia (wisdom)|Sophia]] in his writings.&lt;ref name="Versluis"&gt;Arthur Versluis,  "Western Esotericism and The Harmony Society", ''Esoterica I'' (1999) pp. 20-47 [http://www.esoteric.msu.edu/Versluis.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  Rapp was very influenced by the writings of [[Jakob Böhme]],&lt;ref name ="Versluis"/&gt; [[Philipp Jakob Spener]], and [[Emanuel Swedenborg]], among others.  Also, in [[Ambridge, Pennsylvania|Economy, Pennsylvania]], there are glass bottles and literature that seems to indicate that the group was interested in (and practiced) [[alchemy]].&lt;ref name ="Versluis"/&gt;  Some other books that were found in the Harmony Society's library in [[Old Economy Village|Old Economy, Pennsylvania]], include those by the following authors: [[Christoph Schütz]], [[Gottfried Arnold]], [[Justinus Kerner]], [http://www.passtheword.org/Thomas-Bromley/ Thomas Bromley], [[Jane Leade]], [[Johann Scheible]] (''[[Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses]]''[http://www.esotericarchives.com/moses/67moses.htm]), [[Paracelsus]], and [[Georg von Welling]] ([http://www.esoteric.msu.edu/Archive/Welling.html ''Opus Mago-Cabalisticum'']), among others.

The Harmonites tended to view [[Single person|unmarried]] [[celibacy|celibate]] life as morally superior to [[marriage]], based on Rapp's belief that [[God]] had originally created [[Adam]] as a dual being having male and female sexual organs.&lt;ref&gt;Karl J. R. Arndt, ''George Rapp's Successors and Material Heirs, 1847–1916'' (Rutherford, NJ: Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 1971), p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this view, when the female portion of Adam separated to form [[Eve]], disharmony followed, but one could attempt to regain harmony through celibacy.

==Controversy and problems==

George Rapp's life was not without controversy and problems.  Rapp and the Harmony Society were involved in protracted legal cases:  many relating to the monetary claims by former Society members who did not feel properly compensated for their time and labor, other cases concerned the ownership and sale of property Society members left in Württemberg, and legal complications from fines and payments made to avoid militia service.  Rapp was called a tyrant and Society members his slaves.   During elections, the Society was seen as a monolithic voting block which caused political ill feelings and generated animosity against Rapp.  He was accused of killing his son Johannes – who died in an industrial accident.  Rapp predicted that on September 15, 1829, the three and one half years of the [[Woman of the Apocalypse|Sun Woman]] would end and [[Christ]] would begin his reign on earth.&lt;ref name="Baumgartner"/&gt;  Dissension grew when Rapp's predictions went unfulfilled.  Perhaps his greatest error was in 1831 when he accepted [[Bernhard Müller]], who called himself Maximilian Count de Leon, the "Lion of Judah" as the man who would unite all true Christians.  In the year that followed Rapp changed his mind, but one third of the Society members separated and joined with [[Bernhard Müller|Müller]] in establishing a separate community, the [[New Philadelphian Congregation]].  After Rapp's death in 1847, a number of members left the group because of disappointment and disillusionment over the fact that his prophecies regarding the return of Jesus Christ in his lifetime were not fulfilled.  His last words to his followers were, "If I did not so fully believe, that the Lord has designated me to place our society before His presence in the land of Canaan, I would consider this my last".&lt;ref&gt;William E. Wilson, ''The Angel and the Serpent: The Story of New Harmony'' (Indiana University Press, 1984) p.11&lt;/ref&gt;

The Harmonite [[commune (intentional community)|commune]] ultimately failed because the policy of [[celibacy]] prevented new members from within, and the majority of the outside world had no desire to give up so much to live in a commune. The society was formally dissolved in 1906.

Hamsheni mani is a form of the Turkish folk dance [[Kaşık Havası]].

The meter is 4/4. It is danced by [[Anatolia]]n [[Hemshin peoples|Hemshin people]], [[Crypto-Armenians]], [[Yörük]] and others. Its light-hearted lyrics tell the story of a village man's plot to seduce his love.

==Original form==
The original form of the [[Türkü]] was popular in [[Silifke]], [[Ankara]] .

[[File:Equestrian statue of Henri Christophe in Port-au-Prince 2018.jpg|thumb|Equestrian statue of Henri Christophe in the Haitian capital [[Port-au-Prince]]]]

'''Henry Christophe'''&lt;ref&gt;Henry Christophe spelled his first name with a 'y,' and official court documents followed the same convention, as is evidence notably in the [https://archive.org/stream/almanachroyaldha1816caph#page/n5/mode/2up ''Almanach Royal d'Hayti''.]  This is not, as is often assumed, the English spelling, but rather a traditional spelling notably adopted by eponymous French kings. See for example [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/1585_signature_of_King_Henri_IV_of_France.jpg the signature of King Henry IV of France.] &lt;/ref&gt; ({{IPA-fr|ɑ̃ʁi kʁistɔf}}; 6 October 1767 – 8 October 1820) was a key leader in the [[Haitian Revolution]] and the only monarch of the [[Kingdom of Haiti]]. 

Christophe was a former slave of [[Bambara people|Bambara]] ethnicity in [[West Africa]], and perhaps of [[Ibo people|Igbo]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Haïti ou Saint-Domingue, Vol 2|last1=Mollien|first1=Gaspard Théodore, Comte de|date=2006|publisher=L'Harmattan|location=Paris|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with the Slave Uprising of 1791, he rose to power in the ranks of the Haitian revolutionary military. The revolution succeeded in gaining independence from France in 1804. In 1805 he took part under [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]] in the capturing of [[Era de Francia|Santo Domingo]] (now Dominican Republic), against French forces who acquired the colony from Spain in the [[Peace of Basel|Treaty of Basel]].

After Dessalines was assassinated, Christophe retreated to the [[Plaine-du-Nord]] and created a separate government. On 17 February 1807, he was elected [[President of Haïti|President]] of the [[State of Haiti]], as he named that area. [[Alexandre Pétion]] was elected president in the South.  On 26 March 1811, Christophe created a kingdom in the North and was later proclaimed '''Henry I, King of Haïti.''' He also created a nobility and named his legitimate son [[Jacques-Victor Henry, Prince Royal of Haiti|Jacques-Victor Henry]] as prince and heir.

He is known for constructing Citadel Henry, now known as [[Citadelle Laferrière]], the [[Sans-Souci Palace]], and numerous other palaces.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gauvin Alexander Bailey]], ''The Palace of Sans-Souci in Milot, Haiti (ca. 1806 - 1813): The Untold Story of the Potsdam of the Rainforest'' (Munich and Berlin, Deutscher Kunstverlag, 2017)[https://www.deutscherkunstverlag.de/vorschau/buchdetail/anzeige/der-palast-von-sans-souci-in-milot-haiti-the-palace-of-sans-souci-in-milot-haiti.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Under his policies of ''[[corvée]],'' or forced labor, the Kingdom earned revenues from agricultural production, primarily sugar; but the people resented the system. He reached agreement with Great Britain to respect its Caribbean colonies in exchange for their warnings to his government of any French navy activity threatening Haiti. Unpopular, ill and fearing a coup, he committed suicide.  His son and heir was assassinated 10 days later. The general [[Jean-Pierre Boyer]] came to power and reunited the two parts of Haiti.

==Early life==
Claims about Christophe's place of birth and life before coming to prominence have been contested since the early nineteenth century. Born Christophe Henry, probably in [[Grenada]] but perhaps [[Saint Kitts|St Kitts]]&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Rainsford's 1802 '[https://books.google.ee/books?id=0LZXAAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=et&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false St Domingo, or, An Historical, Political and Literary Sketch of the Black Republic]' gives Christophe's birthplace as St Domingo. An 1803 letter from Edward Corbet in the UK National Archives says Grenada. Pierre McCallum's 1805 '[[iarchive:travelsintrinid01mcagoog|Travels in Trinidad During the Months of February, March, and April, 1803]]' claims St. Kitts.&lt;/ref&gt; the son of a slave mother and Christophe, a freeman, he was brought as a slave to the northern part of [[Saint-Domingue]].  In 1779 he may have served with the French forces as a drummer boy in the [[Chasseurs-Volontaires de Saint-Domingue]], a regiment composed of [[gens de couleur]] ([[mixed-race]] residents of Saint-Domingue). They fought at the [[Siege of Savannah]], a battle during the [[American Revolutionary War]].&lt;ref name=haitianhistory.org&gt;[http://www.haitianhistory.org/contents.php?pagetitle=History HAITIAN MONUMENT OUTLINE]{{dead link|date=March 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Haitian History&lt;/ref&gt; It is claimed that Christophe was wounded in this battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_8mRKAAAAcAAJ|title=Essai sur les Causes de la Révolution et des Guerres Civiles en Haïti|last=Vastey|first=Baron de|publisher=Imprimerie Royale|year=1819|isbn=|location=Sans Souci|pages=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an adult, Christophe may have worked as a mason, sailor, stable hand, waiter, or billiard maker; if so, most of his pay would have gone to his master.&lt;ref name="Monfried" /&gt; One popular story claims that he worked in and managed La Couronne, a hotel restaurant in [[Cap-Haïtien|Cap-Français]], the first capital of the French colony of Saint-Domingue and a major colonial city.  There, the legend goes, he became skilled at dealing with the ''grand blancs,'' as the wealthy white French planters were called. However, none of the hotel's sales records support this claim. He was said to have gained his freedom from slavery as a young man, before the [[Haitian Revolution#1791 slave rebellion|Slave Uprising of 1791]]. Sometime after he had settled in Haiti, he brought his sister Marie there; she married and had children. The political skills he learned as a hotelier also served him well when he later became an officer in the military and leader in the country.&lt;ref name=GENEALOGY /&gt;

Beginning with the slave uprising of 1791, Christophe distinguished himself as a soldier in the [[Haitian Revolution]] and quickly rose to be a colonel during the revolutionary years. He fought for years with [[Toussaint Louverture]] in the North, helping to defeat the French colonists, the Spanish, British, and finally French national troops, and becoming commander-in-chief at Cap-Français. By 1802 Louverture had promoted him to general.

==Independent Haiti==
The French deported Toussaint Louverture to France, and brought in more than 20,000 new troops under the Vicomte de [[Donatien-Marie-Joseph de Vimeur, vicomte de Rochambeau|Rochambeau]] in an effort to regain control of the colony and re-establish slavery.  [[Jean Jacques Dessalines]] led the fight to defeat French forces. The French withdrew their 7,000 surviving troops in late 1803; most fatalities had occurred as a result of a [[yellow fever]] epidemic among its forces.  As leader, Dessalines declared the independence of Saint-Domingue with its new name of Haïti in 1804.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} 

Christophe was in charge of the Northern division of the country, where he notably supervised the first steps of the construction of [[Citadelle Laferrière]]. In 1805, General Nicolas Geffrard, commander in the South, approached Christophe with a plot to kill [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines|Dessalines]]; seeing an opportunity to seize power, he did not warn the self-proclaimed Emperor. Christophe's influence and power in the North was such that Dessalines, though aware of opposition brewing against him in the highest circles of power, found himself unable to strike against his general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R98CAAAAYAAJ|title=Histoire d'Haïti Tome 3|last=Madiou|first=Thomas|publisher=Courtois|year=1849|isbn=|location=|pages=226-290}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conspiracy involved the majority of Dessalines' senior officers, including Dessalines' Minister of War and Navy Etienne Elie Gérin, General [[Alexandre Pétion]], commander-in-chief of the second division in the West, General Nicolas Geffrard and many others. On 16 October 1806, they signed a Proclamation entitled "Resistance to Oppression," that declared the necessity to overthrow Dessalines' government and proclaimed Christophe head of the provisional Haitian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R98CAAAAYAAJ|title=Histoire d'Haïti, Tome 3|last=Madiou|first=Thomas|publisher=Courtois|year=1849|isbn=|location=|pages=313-316}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines|Dessalines]] was assassinated on 17 October 1806.

==Failed military invasion of 1805==
In 1805 French troops were still posted on the eastern part of the island (mainly in Santo Domingo), where they were led by the French officer Marie-Louis Ferrand.  He mobilized his troops and ordered them to seize all black children of both sexes below the age of 14 years to be sold as slaves. Learning of this action, Dessalines was outraged and decided to invade Santo Domingo, with his forces [[looting]] several towns, such as [[Azua Province|Azua]] and [[Moca, Dominican Republic|Moca]], and finally laying  [[siege]] to the city of [[Santo Domingo]], the stronghold of the French.

The Haitian general Henry Christophe (referred to as '''Enrique Cristóbal''' in Spanish-language accounts), under Dessalines, attacked the towns of Moca and [[Santiago de los Caballeros|Santiago]]. The barrister Gaspar de Arredondo y Pichardo wrote, "40 children had their throats cut at the Moca's church, and the bodies found at the presbytery, which is the space that encircles the church's altar..."&lt;ref&gt;Gaspar de Arredondo y Pichardo, ''Memoria de mi salida de la isla de Santo Domingo el 28 de abril de 1805'' (Memoirs of my leaving the island of Santo Domingo 28 April 1805)&lt;/ref&gt;  This event was one of several documented accounts of atrocities perpetrated by General Christophe, under the orders of Dessalines; they retreated from the Spanish-ruled side of the island after their failed invasion attempt of 1805.

On 6 April 1805, having gathered all his troops, General Christophe took all male prisoners to the local cemetery and proceeded to slit their throats, among them Presbyter Vásquez and 20 more priests. Later he [[Scorched earth|set on fire]] the whole town along with its five churches. On his way out he took along, fashioned like a herd, 249 women, 430 girls and 318 boys, a steep figure considering the relatively low population of the town at that time. Alejandro Llenas wrote that Christophe took 997 from [[Santiago de los Caballeros|Santiago]] alone, and "[[Monte Plata]], [[San Pedro de Macorís|San Pedro]] and [[Cotuí]] were reduced to ashes, and their residents either had their throats slit or were taken captives by the thousands, like farm animals, tied up and getting beaten on their way to Haiti."{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Before leaving Santo Domingo, Dessalines "gave the order to ... commanders posted in conquered communities, to round up all dwellers and subdue them to prison, in so, at first command, have them stomped by mules and other beasts upon arriving to the Haitian side."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsglobaldaily24hours.com/2012/01/la-verdad-de-la-historia-del.html |title=La verdad de la Historia del autoproclamado Rey Henri Christophe, o Henri I de Haití y Jean Jacques Dessalines |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727065545/http://www.newsglobaldaily24hours.com/2012/01/la-verdad-de-la-historia-del.html |archive-date=27 July 2013 |newspaper=Noticias Globales Diarias |date=13 January 2012 |language=es |access-date=29 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==State and Kingdom of Haiti==
[[File:Crown, Henry I of Haiti (Henri Christophe), Haiti, 1820 - Bode-Museum - DSC02719.JPG|thumb|right|[[Haitian livre]] coin with portrait of Henry I in style of Roman [[solidus (coin)|solidus]], minted {{circa|lk=no}} 1820. {{efn|The coin is inscribed in slightly broken [[Latin]] as ''"HENRICUS DEI GRATIA HAITI REX"'' ({{lang-en|Henry, by the Grace of God, King of Haiti}}).}}]]
Following a power struggle with Pétion and his supporters in the South, Christophe retreated with his followers to the [[Plaine-du-Nord]] of Haiti, the stronghold of former slaves, and created a separate government there.  Christophe suspected he was also at risk of assassination in the South. In 1807 he declared himself "président et généralissime des forces de terre et de mer de l'État d'Haïti'" (English: President and [[Generalissimo]] of the armies of land and sea of the State of Haïti).&lt;ref name="ceac"/&gt;  Pétion became President of the "Republic of Haïti" in the south, where he was backed by General [[Jean-Pierre Boyer]], a ''gens du couleur'' who controlled the southern armies.

In 1811 Henry declared the northern state of Haïti a [[Kingdom of Haiti|kingdom]] and had himself crowned by Corneil Breuil, the archbishop of [[Milot, Haiti|Milot]]. The 1 April 1811 edict gave his full title as

&lt;blockquote&gt;Henry, par la grâce de Dieu et la Loi constitutionelle de l'État Roi d'Haïti, Souverain des Îles de la Tortue, Gonâve, et autres îles adjacentes, Destructeur de la tyrannie, Régénérateur et bienfaiteur de la nation haïtienne, Créateur de ses institutiones morales, politiques et guerrières, Premier monarque couronné du Nouveau-Monde, Défenseur de la foi, Fondateur de l'ordre royal et militaire de Saint-Henri.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He renamed Cap-Français as ''[[Cap-Henri|Cap-Henry]]'' (later renamed as [[Cap-Haïtien]]).&lt;ref name="Cap-Haïtien"&gt;[http://www.lonelyplanet.com/haiti/northern-haiti/cap-haitien/history History of Cap-Haïtien]&lt;/ref&gt;

Christophe named his legitimate son [[Jacques-Victor Henry, Prince Royal of Haiti|Jacques-Victor Henry]] heir apparent, giving him the title of Prince Royal of Haïti.&lt;ref name="Monfried"&gt;Monfried, Walter, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZToDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=%22Henri+Christophe%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=EpRaS57_E4TUlQS_iuSMDQ&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Henri%20Christophe%22&amp;f=false The Slave Who Became King: Henri Christophe]", ''Negro Digest'', Volume XII, Number 12, October, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GENEALOGY&gt;[http://www.royalark.net/Haiti/haiti4.htm CHRISTOPHE GENEALOGY]&lt;/ref&gt; His second son was a colonel in his army.&lt;ref name=GENEALOGY /&gt;

Christophe built six châteaux, eight palaces and the massive [[Citadelle Laferrière]], on a mountain near Milot.  With the remains of the [[Sans-Souci Palace]], it has been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  Nine years later, at the end of his monarchy, Henry increased the number of designated nobility from the original 87 to 134.&lt;ref&gt;Cheesman, 2007, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The two parts of Haiti struggled to increase agricultural production to recover from the expensive and damaging wars. The United States had only recently ended its arms and goods embargo against Haiti, and began war with Great Britain in the [[War of 1812]].  Christophe had to choose whether to enforce a version of the slave plantation system to increase agricultural production, or to subdivide the land into parcels for peasants' subsistence farming.  The latter was the policy of President Pétion in the South. King Henry chose to enforce ''[[corvée]]'' plantation work, a system of forced labor, in lieu of taxes, but also began his massive building projects. During his reign, Northern Haiti was despotic but the sugar cane economy generated revenue for government and officials.

He made an agreement with Britain that Haiti would not threaten its Caribbean colonies; in return the British Navy would warn Haiti of imminent attacks from French troops.  In 1807 the British Parliament passed the [[Slave Trade Act 1807|Slave Trade Act of 1807]] to abolish the importation of African slaves into British territories.  Because of increased bilateral trade with Britain, Christophe's government earned an enormous sum of British pounds for his treasury.  By contrast, Petion's Southern Haiti became much poorer because the land-share system reduced agricultural productivity, and exports fell.&lt;ref&gt;Griggs and Prator, James.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nobility and heraldry==
[[File:Henry I, King of Haiti.jpg|thumb|In this portrait executed by a German artist in the Royal Court, Henry wears the grand cross of the Royal and Military Order of St. Henry (''Ordre Royal et Militaire de Saint Henry'')]]
As king, Christophe created an elaborate Haitian peerage (nobility), originally consisting of four Princes, eight Dukes, 22 Counts, 40 Barons, and 14 Knights ("chevaliers").  Christophe founded a College of Arms to provide armorial bearings for the newly ennobled. For his personal coat of arms, Christophe chose a crowned phoenix rising from flames, and the motto 'Je renais de mes cendres' ('I rise from my ashes'), presumably in reference to the rebirth of Cap Henry after he himself burned it in 1802  to repel the invading French army. 

Some Europeans mocked his creation. The titles of the Duc de Limonade (Julien Prévost, Christophe's secretary of state) and Duc de Marmelade (Jean-Pierre Richard, governor of Cap Henry) were considered particularly comic by those unaware that they were actually derived from place names given by the previous French colonists&lt;ref name="ceac" /&gt;.

The '''coat of arms of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]]''' was the [[coat of arms|heraldic emblem]] of its [[King of Castile|monarchs]]. Historian [[Michel Pastoureau]] says that the original purpose ofheraldic emblems and [[Seal (emblem)|seal]]s was to facilitate the exercise of power and the identification of the ruler, due to they offered for achieving these aims. These symbols were associated with the kingdom, and eventually also represented the intangible nature of the national sentiment or sense of belonging to a territory.&lt;ref name=cortazar&gt;García de Cortázar, J.A.; Sesma Muñoz, J.A. (1998) La Edad Media: una síntesis interpretativa [The Middle Ages: an interpretive synthesis]. Madrid: Alianza Editorial. P. 681. [[ISBN|ISBN 84-206-2894-8]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[blazon]]''' of the arms of Castile is:

{{Quote|''[[Gules]] a triple-towered castle [[Or (heraldry)|Or]] masoned [[Sable (heraldry)|Sable]] and ajoure [[Azure (heraldry)|Azure]].''&lt;ref name="coalaw"&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.boe.es/diario_boe/txt.php?id=BOE-A-1981-24155 Act 33/1981], 5 October ([[Boletín Oficial del Estado|BOE]] Nro. 250, 19 October 1981). Coat of arms of Spain.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Origin ==
The Royal Arms of Castile first adopted at the start of the age of heraldry (circa 1175),&lt;ref name="cortazar" /&gt; that spread across Europe during the next century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Woodcock (officer of arms)|Thomas Woodcock]] &amp; [[John Martin Robinson]], ''The Oxford Guide to Heraldry'', Oxford University Press, New York (1988), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish heraldist Faustino Menéndez Pidal de Navascués explained that there is no evidence that there was a consolidated Castilian emblem before the reign of King [[Alfonso VIII of Castile|Alfonso VIII]] or these arms  had pre-heraldic history as the [[heraldry of León]]. 
[[File:Alfonso VIII de Castilla y Leonor.jpg|thumb|200px|Miniature depicting King [[Alfonso VIII of Castile]], that adopted a castle as device, and his wife [[Eleanor of England, Queen of Castile|Eleanor of England]]]]

The [[Chancery (medieval office)|chancery]] of Alfonso VIII adopted a ''Signum Regis'' ([[Seal (emblem)|seal]]) in 1165. This device had wheel shape, a defining characteristic of the chancery of [[monarchs of Castile]] since 1157. This author has pointed out that the emergence of the [[castle]] device [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] was similarly to the [[Kingdom of León|Leonese]] lion but at a much more accelerated pace. One of the earliest known testimonies that document the origin of the castle emblem was carried out by bishop [[Lucas de Tuy]]. In Castile, as it was common at that time, the first examples of the castle as heraldic symbols have been found at the reverse of pendent seals. The ''Signum Regis'' of King Alfonso VIII not always shown a castle. This monarch initially used a seal with a [[cross]] with pole. By the year 1163 was used a single side with an equestrian image of Alfonso VIII holding a lance without an standard, this element would have allowed us to determine the royal device used at that time. Following seals continued depicting equestrian images as central motif. The castle appeared for first time on the reverse of pendent seals. The first preserved seal impression with the castle dates from 1176, contained in a document located in the [[Toledo Cathedral]]. The matrix of this seal dates back before 1171 due to its typology. According Faustino Menéndez Pidal de Navascués it is likelythat the device of the castle was adopted in 1169, when Alfonso VIII came of age at fourteen. As a clear example of [[canting arms]], the castle was adopted with a clear territorial connotation. This decision could be motivated by a desire to claim the sovereignty of the Castilian monarch against the Kingdom of León.

Since from its inception the castle has retained a basic design - three towers, higher the central than lateral ones - leads to the conclusion that it is a native creation, different from the existing in [[Central Europe]].

Concerning the colours of the arms ([[Tincture (heraldry)|tincture]] according to heraldry), it has been found that the combination  «''Or on a [[Gules]] field''», was already fixed at least since the reign of King [[Ferdinand III of Castile|Ferdinand III]], called ''the Saint''. This selection could be determined by the Heraldry of the consort of the King [[Alfonso VIII of Castile|Alfonso VIII]], Queen [[Eleanor of England, Queen of Castile|Eleanor of England]], daughter of [[Henry II of England|Henry II, King of England]]. The arms used by the Queen were the [[Royal Arms of England]], three identical gold [[lion (heraldry)|lion]]s (also known as leopards) with blue tongues and claws, walking past but facing the observer, arranged in a column on a red background. Although the tincture ''azure'' of tongue and claws is not cited in many blazons, they are historically a distinguishing feature of the Arms of England. These arms, which are one of the oldest heraldic emblems, have had much success at that time due to the ease which offered be easily recognisable at distance.

This hypothesis is reinforced by the fact that the marriage of Alfonso VIII and Eleanor was celebrated from 1170 to 1176, dates immediately prior to the adoption of the emblem according preserved sources. Faustino Menéndez Pidal de Navascués defends as another possible reason for the choice of this combination of colors, for appearing more frequently in the arms. The selection of the third colour, shown in the door and windows, ''[[Azure (heraldry)|Azure]]'' (blue) could be due to the contrast with the other two, offering or that it was the third most commonly used colour after the previous.

In the Reign of Alfonso VIII was usual that the castle emblem was presented as device and not in a [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]]. We can be seen this device on the tomb of Alfonso VIII and Queen Eleanor, in the [[Abbey of Santa María la Real de Las Huelgas]] ([[Burgos]]). The grave is decorated with the device of the castle and the English arms shown in a shield. The Castle, as a device and not as part of an escutcheon, appears in all Castilian coins of the time. Castle devices placed in row have been found on two stoles embroidered by Queen Eleanor from 1197 to 1198. One of the first representations of the castle emblem in an escutcheon has been displayed on a green [[brocade]] removed from the tomb of King Alfonso VIII.

In the middle of the [[13th century]], the Royal Arms of Castile were propagated all over Europe, a phenomenon that had no precedent or parallel, despite the male offspring of Alfonso VIII not survived him. This propagation had no a territorial component, except for the line that inherited the Throne of Castile because they were used as emblem of the maternal lineage and occurred in the Royal houses of [[Kingdom of France|France]], [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]] and Aragon.

The Castilian arms were present in the heraldry of all the grandchildren of Alfonso VIII, except Kings [[Louis IX of France]] and [[Sancho II of Portugal]] that, as reigning monarchs, used their respective "[[arms of dominion]]". Castles ''Or'' on field ''Gules'' were included on the shields of the children of [[Louis VIII of France]] and [[Blanche of Castile|Queen Blanche]]. We can also find them on the tomb of other maternal grandson of Alfonso VIII, Infante Alfonso of Aragon (1222-1260), the eldest son of [[James I of Aragon]] and [[Eleanor of Castile (died 1244)|Queen Eleanor]], decorated with the [[Coat of arms of the Crown of Aragon|four paletts ''Gules'']] and differenced  with a [[bordure]] charged with twenty [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheons]] ''Gules'' with castles. But the most prominent example occurred in Portugal, when [[Afonso III of Portugal|Afonso III]] added a bordure ''Gules'' charged with castles to the royal arms and remaining these until 1910, when the country became a [[republic]]. Since 1911 the bordure with castles have continued as part of the [[Coat of arms of Portugal|national coat of arms]] of Portugal.

When his father, [[Alfonso IX of León|Alfonso IX]], died in 1230, King Ferdinand III of Castile receive the [[Kingdom of León]] and united the two kingdoms. The King wanted to symbolize the [[Crown of Castile|union]], for the first time, [[Quartering (heraldry)|quartering]] the Castilian and Leonese arms, giving the arms of Castile pride of place. His aim was to have a device that reflects an indivisible union of kingdoms due to of the transitory symbolism of the [[Impalement (heraldry)|impalement]] and secondary of the [[bordure]]. This method, very widespread spread in the Heraldry of different countries, was soon followed successfully throughout [[Europe]]. In the middle of the [[12th century]] quarterings were used by monarchs of [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon-Sicily]], [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] and others like the Kings of [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]] or [[Bohemia]] adopted it during the next century. [[John I of Castile]]  impaled the Castilian quartering with the [[Coat of arms of Portugal|arms of Portugal]] as pretender to the throne of this kingdom. The Royal Arms of Castile quartered with the Leonese ones were borne by the Castilian monarchs until the reign of the [[Catholic Monarchs]]. The quartering was remained as symbol associated with the Crown of Castile territory until the promulgation of the [[Nueva Planta decrees|''Nueva Plant''a decrees]] by [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]] in 1715.

In 1475, [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella of Castile]] and [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] joined the arms of the Crowns of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] in a quarterly shield. It followed the method created by Fernando III and giving the arms of Castile pride of place again.

As above, in all these cases giving the Castilian arms pride of place.

Leaving aside the Spanish local and provincial heraldry, where can be found numerous examples and being the most prominent the [[Coat of arms of Toledo (Spain)|coat of arms of Toledo]], the Castilian arms are among the elements of the coats of arms of the [[Autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous communities]] (regions) of [[Castile and León]] (which has adopted the quartering of Ferdinand III), [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]], [[Castilla-La Mancha|Castile-La Mancha]], [[Extremadura]], [[Community of Madrid|Madrid]], [[Region of Murcia|Murcia]] and within the bordures of the [[Autonomous city|autonomous cities]] of [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]].

Outside the [[Iberian Peninsula]], the castle of Castile is depicted in the arms granted to capitals of the [[Spanish Empire]], as is the case of the capital of [[Ecuador]] [[Quito|San Francisco de Quito]], with a triple-towered castle ''[[Argent]]'' and two eagles [[Sable (heraldry)|Sable]] on field ''Gules''.

[[File:Coat of Arms of Castile with the Royal Crest.svg|thumb|300x300px|Castilian [[armorial achievement]] with the Royal Crest (After the union with [[Kingdom of León|León]])]]
The Royal Crest of Castile, also called Crest of the Castle and the Lion, was it that used the last monarchs of Castile and Spain until the [[19th century]]. This [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] consisted of a castle or fortress with nascent lion on top. These two figures are [[Charge (heraldry)|charges]] of the Royal arms of the former Crown of Castile. King [[John II of Castile|John II]] (1406–1454) adopted this crest was, its use is documented in ten and twenty ''[[dobla]]s'' coins, minted in the city of [[Seville]]. According to historian José María de Francisco Olmos in his study of the late medieval Castilian currency, the obverse of these coins are represented a shield with the [[Royal Bend of Castile|Device of the Bend]] and the Castilian Royal Crest. In the same study, the author recalls that the Crest of the Castle and the Lion is also represented at an image of King John II, an equestrian portrait of the ''Armorial of the Golden Fleece'', preserved in the [[Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal]] ([[Paris]]).&lt;ref name="FranciscoOlmos"&gt;{{cite web|first=José María de|last=Francisco Olmos|url=http://www.ucm.es/info/citechar/jornadas/II%20JORNADAS/jor09defrancisco.pdf|title=''La moneda de la Castilla bajomedieval: medio de propaganda e instrumento económico''|trans-title=The currency of Castile in the Late Middle Ages: means of propaganda and economic instrument|language=Spanish|publisher=[[Complutense University of Madrid]]|date= |pages=325–327|accessdate=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faustino Menéndez Pidal de Navascués noted that, previously, the Castilian monarchs had used a crest, consisting of the figure of a nascent [[griffin]] ''Or''. This crest, reproduced in the ''[[Armorial de Gelre]]'' (folio page 60v),  was used by [[Henry II of Castile|Henry II]], John I and [[Henry III of Castile|Henry III]].{{sfn|Menéndez Pidal|1999|p=89}} After the reign of the [[Catholic Monarchs]], there is evidence of its usage by [[Philip I of Castile|Philip I]] in some versions of his [[Achievement (heraldry)|archievement]] adopted as King ''jure uxoris'' of Castile. There are two prominent examples in his seal&lt;ref&gt;[//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Posse_Band_3_0010.jpg?uselang=fr] Image of the seal of King Philip I of Castile: Posse, O. ''Die Siegel der deutschen Kaiser und Könige v. 3 (1493 - 1711)
'', 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; and the book of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]], illustrated by [[Simon Bening]]. The archievement of King Philip I was reproduced in this book due his status as sovereign and [[Grand Master (order)|grand master]] of this order.&lt;ref&gt;[[:m:commons:File:Simon_Bening_-_Libro_del_Toison_-_Emblema_de_Filipe_El_Hermoso.jpg|Image of the archievement of King Philip I with the Royal Crest of Castile by Simon Bening.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spanish monarchs of the [[House of Habsburg]] also maintained the royal crest in their archievement. At the beginning of the [[16th century]] the lion of the crest, crowned, began to hold a sword and a ''[[globus cruciger]]''. [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] and [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]] added two crowned helmets with nascent dragons, the crests of the [[King of Portugal|Portuguese]] and [[King of Aragon|Aragonese monarchs]]; besides, it gave the crest and arms of Castile pride of place (the central position). This archievement is placed above the bronze figures, portrait of the family of Philip II, by the Milanese sculptor Pompeo Leoni (1533-1608), son of [[Leone Leoni]] , that are located in the interior of the Basilica of [[El Escorial]] ([[Community of Madrid|Madrid]]).{{sfn|Menéndez Pidal|1999|p=196}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100326023118/http://sapiens.ya.com/jrcuadra/tx-text3.htm ''Image of the archievement with crests located in the Basilica of El Escorial''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of Spanish monarchs gave the Castilian quarters pride of place in their arms, the Royal Crest of Castile remained as single crest at their armorial achievement. Both latest versions of the armorial achievement of Spain with the royal crest, adopted by Philip V and his son [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]], showed the lion of the crest with a modern royal crown (with eight [[Half-arch (crown)|half arches]]) and a scroll charged with the [[battle cry]] '''''[[Santiago!]]'''''. The meaning of the phrase is to praise [[James, son of Zebedee|St. James]] the apostle, patron saint of Spain. At that time, it was usual to consider the Royal Crest of Castile as the crest of the whole of Spain, thus it was exposed by heraldists as José de Avilés e Iturbide, 1st Marquis of Avilés,  in his book ''Ciencia heroyca''. Since the [[18th century]], full royal armorial achievements were used occasionally and the crest of the Castle and lion practically fell into disuse&lt;ref&gt;Avilés, José de Avilés, Marqués de.

In heraldry, [[supporter]]s are figures or objects usually placed on either side of the shield and depicted holding it up, first appeared in English heraldry in the 15th century. Originally, they were not regarded as an integral part of arms, and were subject to frequent change. Lions were sporadically shown supporting the arms of the Castilian monarch and were introduced by John II.{{sfn|Menéndez Pidal|1999|p=86}} The lions as supporters were displayed until the reign of Philip V&lt;ref name="CastañedaAlcover"/&gt; and, after 1868, in some ornate versions of the national arms of Spain.&lt;ref name="Heraldo"&gt;{{cite web|first=|last=|url=https://www.heraldo.es/noticias/aragon/el_escudo_franquista_que_preside_tunel_todo_simbolo_del_abandono.html|title=''El escudo franquista que preside el túnel, todo un símbolo del abandono''|trans-title=The Francoist coat of arms, that presides over the tunnel, a symbol of neglect|language=Spanish|publisher=''www.heraldo.es''|date=5 August 2010 |pages=|accessdate=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Castilian flags ==
As it was quite usual during the [[Middle Ages]] many [[flag]]s, [[Banner of arms|banners]] and [[Heraldic flag|standard]]s were not standardized. There has never been a Castilian royal standard or banner with a unique design. There were varied designs of the castle or colours of the fabric, depending on the artisan or prevailing fashion. They have their origin in the representation of the arms of the Castilian monarch on cloth to be used as flag and, by extension were emblem of the Kingdom and the [[Castile (historical region)|Historic Region of Castile]]. The field ''Gules'' was represented in more or less dark reddish tones, although a more specific colour, [[crimson]], has been used very frequently in Castile.

&lt;/gallery&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

A triple-towered castle on red or crimson fabric has shown in stardards used by Castilian monarchs. The quartering of Ferdinand III was also displayed on his standard and it has served as the basis for current flags of autonomous communities of [[Flag of Castile and León|Castile and León]] and [[Castilla-La Mancha|Castile-La Mancha]]. Further confusions led to apply the colour purple to a legendary «Castilian banner» (which neither preserved nor has never been documented), identifying the color purple as symbol of the Kingdom of Castile, something that influenced in the [[Flag of the Second Spanish Republic|flag]] of the [[Second Spanish Republic]] and its lowest band. There are different hypotheses to explain the origin of the confusion. Fundamentally, the origin part of chromatic colour relationship among purple and red/crimson. Colour crimson was also widely used to represent the color purple, used in the ancient world as symbol of the sovereignty and authority of monarchs. One of the assumptions made is supported by the fact that with the passage of time many cloths, that originally were crimson, worn may become confused with other [[Hue|tones]], as the purple.&lt;ref&gt;O´Donnell, Hugo.

'''Herman Basudde''' (1958–1997) was a Ugandan [[Kadongo Kamu|kadongo kamu]] musician. Basudde was born in [[Masaka District]], in southern [[Uganda]].

==Background==
Little is known of his early life. According to his brother Sserunjoji, the reason he did not go further may be due to lack of funds to facilitate his love and passion for music. His mother [[Namyalo]] narrates that Herman Basudde attended Kibanda and Butenga primary school. One of his classmates says that in Basudde's school years he was a quick learner, and had a passion for art and graphics which took most of his time. Basudde also joined a school choir which earned him credits due to his soft and Ilouder voice.
The legacy of Busudde in the field of music came a long way from his father. The late [[Mark Makumbi]], a former [[Bukedde]] TV and CBS Radio presenter while giving the background of [[Kadongokamu]] singers, talks about Basudde. He says that his father was an X-soldier from second world war veteran. He had a white friend called Brown, who loved him so much. When the mission was accomplished and was time to depart from one another, Brown gave him a guitar saying take this, I don’t have money to give you, let it be a souvenir to remember me from” on his return home, he kept the guitar because it was of no use to him.
He started to play a guitar at home without anyone teaching him.
As time went on, his mother tried to stop him from playing the guitar instead of doing household work or school homework; but his father insisted that he go ahead as he might prosper in a musical career. The guitar could hardly leave no space for books. This, in along with absolute poverty through which the family persisted, pushed him to drop out without completing his primary seven.
Whenever there was a party in the village, he could escort his guitar paving a way to entertain the guests. In return as excitement paves, they gave him their appreciation and encouragement in terms of money.
Unfortunately, others saw this upside down. The youth mostly laid a plan to throw him down since he was earning presents and gifts wherever he could go and entertain.
As his culture, one day he entertained Christian at their local Catholic parish. He sang a song he entitled ”amajjiini ngetala luno” (the rampant demons). The priest was overwhelmed where by he told him to play it again and again. At that function, Basudde earned a lot of money offered to him. This troubled his rivals so much. They planned a way of taking him off.
In the area, there was a rebel group called “[[FEDEMU]]” which had captured most of the southern part of Southern [[Uganda]]. Peace was now in their hands. Basudde’s rival youth approached them informing that Basudde had a gun. Immediately, they sagged his father’s house. They searched the whole place. They grabbed him and took him for interrogation. They tortured him unceasingly while asking for the whereabouts of the gun. After all that, he was brought back home nearly to death.
He was taken to [[Masaka]] referral Hospital where he was treated for many days. He was later returned home and given medicine there. As he gained energy, his father advised him to leave the village or else he would loss his life.
In the mid 1980s, he was picked by Eria Katende and brought to [[Kampala]].

==Career==
His career guide was the singer [[Livingstone Kasozi]] who trained him how to play a guitar, sing and perform live on stage.&lt;ref name="alinda"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alinda|first1=Alex|title=Walukagga Visits Kadongo Kamu Legend, Livingstone Kasozi’s Grave|url=http://chimpreports.com/entertainment/walukagga-visits-kadongo-kamu-legend-livingstone-kasozis-grave/|website=chimpreports.com|publisher=Chimp Reports|accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He toured East Africa countries, travelling to Kenya, Tanzania, and Rwanda. This tour raised him over 70 million [[Ugandan shilling|shillings]], a huge amount at that time. {{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Basudde is credited as one of the musicians who revived interest in ''baakisimba'', mixing Western and Kiganda music to appeal to a new audience.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bqjKAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA126&amp;dq=%22Herman+Basudde%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjtjKmQg_zPAhWB6CYKHZ8oBDkQ6AEIITAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Herman%20Basudde%22&amp;f=false Baakisimba: Gender in the Music and Dance of the Baganda People of Uganda, Sylvia Antonia Nannyonga-Tamusuza, Routledge, February 4, 2014, p. 126]&lt;/ref&gt; He had a husky voice, and sang passionate songs about mischievous love affairs, philandering husbands, and bizarre witchcraft. In a popular song, ''Ekiwuka Ekyaga Muntamu'', Basudde used metaphor to invoke the [[AIDS]] epidemic in Uganda. In the song, the narrator dreams of a lizard-like insect invading his home and despoiling life, food and sex.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xP5qY8rO4UEC&amp;pg=PA170&amp;dq=%22Herman+Basudde%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjtjKmQg_zPAhWB6CYKHZ8oBDkQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Herman%20Basudde%22&amp;f=false The Oxford Handbook of Medical Ethnomusicology, Oxford University Press, USA, April 27, 2011, p. 170]&lt;/ref&gt;

Basudde died in an accident while travelling to his parents' house in Masaka, south of Kampala. His funeral was a national occasion, and the funeral fund raised 12 million shillings.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Some saw Basudde as a rebellious spirit. He had left the Catholic Church to adopt animism and was attacked by certain clergy for forsaking religion in favour of witchcraft. He was accused of sensationalising his music by bringing seductively dressed girls onto the stage and commercialising the Kadongo Kamu singers.

==popularity==
[[Basaaya]] [[Rocks Peter]] an historian says that Herman Basudde was a prophet since he could foretell what would happen before. His popularity is still rampant where by many upcoming artists visits his grave to seek wisdom.
[[Fred Ssebatta]], one of Kadongokamu regents, asserts that Herman Basudde was creative and worked quickly. He continued by saying that it would be very difficult to compare Herman Basudde in writing music with anybody. He further said that whenever Herman Basudde could release a song, Ssebatta would target him on the second day.
On 12 October 2012, Gheto president [[Bobi wine]] paid a tribute to the great works of Herman Basudde. He narrates in time like this, 'how I wish prophet Herman Basudde could be around'... He left us to accomplish his mission but, his shoes are far big for us to wear' he said.
Basude composed in his head and couldn’t repeat what he has earlier sung.
Herman Basudde toured East Africa countries, travelling to [[Kenya]], [[Tanzania]] finally to [[Rwanda]]. This tour raised him over 70 million shillings, a huge amount at that time. {{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==Death and aftermath==
Before his death, Basudde had foretold his death through words and actions. Aisha Nakito (widow) narrated what happened days before his death. On 10 June 1997, he went to meet Jane Basirika (concobine) after several days while touring EA . They had a meal in await for Serunjoji. As soon as Serunjoji came, he embraced him. They had some misunderstanding back ago, so they had a family union. After all, they set for [[masaka]].  His father had parralised at home. On their way, they stopped at [[Lukaya, Uganda|Lukaya]]  road toll for a snack. Here Basudde got anoid with a certain man and he was about to fight him. Sylivester Busuulwa. Settled the matter. He started the vehicle with a lot of anger at a high speed. Reaching [[Kabaale]] [[Bugonzi]], a tragidy happened. As a lorry was overtaking, Basudde lost contral and his vehicle overturned several times. ''what a mess this man has caused me!'' He had his last breath. Hermann Basudde, a famous Ugandan singer and guitarist died in a tragic accident while travelling to his parents' house in Masaka, south of Kampala.
Basudde had a huge following for his husky voice and the passion of his lyrics about mischievous love affairs, philandering husbands, bizarre witchcraft and other songs which propelled him from abject poverty to a fortune worth millions during his lifetime.
He had revolutionised the Kadongo Kamu (singers) who were known for their skillful guitar playing.
Before Basudde died he insisted that he be buried with his favourite "dry guitar", as he called it. He had noted that his long term colleague, [[Livingstone]] [[Kasozi]] had been buried holding his favourite cassette tape and he wanted his guitar to console him in the same way in the after life.
Basudde's funeral was a national occasion. There was an outpouring of grief at the vigil by the graveside. [[Television]] showed a sea of humanity attending his burial. An announcer on one of the FM radio stations broke down while telling of his death. And his funeral fund raised Ushs12 million.
Basudde's songs got rave reviews in the local press. The Uganda [[Monitor (Uganda newspaper)|Monitor]] newspaper dubbed them as "spiritually and politically inspiring". Some regretted that he could not still live to fight the foreign culture that was corrupting Ugandan minds via the FM stations.
Others saw Basudde as a rebellious spirit. He had left the Catholic Church to adopt animism and was attacked by certain clergy for forsaking religion in favour of witchcraft. He was accused of sensationalising his music by bringing seductively dressed girls onto the stage and commercialising the Kadongo Kamu singers.

'''Huang Yiliang''' ({{zh|c=黄奕良|p=Huáng Yìliáng}}) (born 1961) is a veteran [[Singapore]]an former [[artist]]e. He was prominently a full-time [[Mediacorp]] artiste from 1980 to 2006.

==Personal life==
He married fellow actress [[Lin Meijiao]] in 1991 and have a daughter [[Chantalle Ng]] in 1995. They divorced in 1997. Their daughter was left with Lin. One of his Star Awards was dedicated to his ex-wife, where he had performed an awesome rant about the divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/entertainment/view/440134/1/.html | title=Huang Yiliang opens up about his failed marriage | accessdate=2010-12-27 | publisher=[[Channel NewsAsia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huang then remarried and has a son with his second wife.

==Career==
Huang started off as a small screen actor with [[MediaCorp]].  He won the ''Best Supporting Actor'' [[Star Awards]] three times and Top 10 Most Popular Male Artistes during his 20-year career there.

He felt that it was time to move on to a different challenge after having acted for the past 20 years and started his own movie producing company Red Group Film and became a movie producer, a film-director and a movie actor.

Huang's first production, [[Autumn In March]] (S$1 million budget), was originally scheduled for big screen but was later downgraded to just DVD-release after failing to get the support of the local movie distributors. However, it did receive overwhelming support from aspiring actresses as more than 300 girls came over for the leading actress audition in [[Singapore]]. Huang left the entertainment industry in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/entertainment/view/1011235/1/.html | title=Huang Yiliang's film fails to hit the big screen | publisher=[[Channel NewsAsia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
===Fined $3000===
He assaulted a woman in Toa Payoh because she failed to clean up after her dog. Huang was upset at the woman’s actions, and an argument ensued. Videos and photos were taken by each other, with the woman standing in front of Huang’s car so he can’t leave. He finally got out of his car to push her down and forcefully hold her there. This issue was taken to court where he was fined $3,000.

'''Jaroslav Seifert''' ({{IPA-cs|ˈjaroslaf ˈsajfr̩t|lang|Jaroslav seifert.ogg}}; 23 September 1901 – 10 January 1986) was a Nobel Prize–winning [[Czechs|Czechoslovak]] writer, poet and journalist.
In 1984 Jaroslav Seifert won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] "for his poetry which endowed with freshness, sensuality and rich inventiveness provides a liberating image of the indomitable spirit and versatility of man".&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1984/ The Nobel Prize in Literature 1984]". Nobelprize.org. Nobel Media AB 2014. Web. 2 Feb 2017. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born in [[Žižkov]], a suburb of [[Prague]] in what was then part of [[Austria-Hungary]], Seifert's first collection of poems was published in 1921. He was a member of the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]] (KSČ), the editor of a number of communist newspapers and magazines – ''Rovnost'', ''Sršatec'', and ''Reflektor'' – and the employee of a communist publishing house.

During the 1920s he was considered a leading representative of the Czechoslovakian artistic avant-garde. He was one of the founders of the journal [[Devětsil]]. In March 1929, he and six other writers left the KSČ after signing a manifesto protesting against [[Bolshevik]] tendencies in the new leadership of the party. He subsequently worked as a journalist in the social-democratic and trade union press during the 1930s and 1940s.

In 1949 Seifert left journalism and began to devote himself exclusively to literature. His poetry was awarded important state prizes in 1936, 1955, and 1968, and in 1967 he was designated National Artist. He was the official Chairman of the Czechoslovak Writer's Union for several years (1968–70). In 1977 he was one of the signatories of [[Charter 77]] in opposition to the government of the [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]]. {{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Seifert was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1984. Due to bad health, he was not present at the award ceremony, and so his daughter received the Nobel Prize in his name. Even though it was a matter of great importance, there was only a brief remark of the award in the state-controlled media. He died in 1986, aged 84, and was buried at the municipal cemetery in [[Kralupy nad Vltavou]] (where his maternal grandparents originated from).

His burial was marked by a high presence of secret police, who tried to suppress any hint of dissent on the part of mourners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1986/Dissidents-And-Authorities-Say-Farewell-To-Nobel-Laureate/id-8feb8b7ef1f1bd7a56804771779831e4 Dissidents And Authorities Say Farewell To Nobel Laureate]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, he worked with the Nebraska Legislature to create Nebraska’s Medicaid Fraud Unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nebraska Revised Statute 68-943|url=http://nebraskalegislature.gov/laws/statutes.php?statute=68-943|publisher=Nebraska State Legislature|accessdate=2013-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Medicaid Fraud Unit recovered more than $20 million in 2012 and nearly $68 million since 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Associated Press|title=Nebraska Medicaid Fraud Unit recoups $20 million|url=http://journalstar.com/news/state-and-regional/statehouse/nebraska-medicaid-fraud-unit-recoups-million/article_f6244cc6-836f-5e19-bc44-9fe02b79e0d8.html|accessdate=2013-01-15|newspaper=Lincoln Journal Star|date=2013-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Bruning launched a criminal probe of University of Nebraska Regent David Hergert related to campaign finances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Associated Press|title=Bruning Launches Criminal Probe of Hergert|url=http://journalstar.com/news/local/article_c2ef102e-3918-53eb-9c0b-4d526015772b.html|publisher=Lincoln Journal Star|accessdate=2013-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, he charged a 20-year-old man with rape after his 14-year-old wife became pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mabin|first=Butch|title=Bruning Charges 22-year-old Man Married to 14-year-old Girl|url=http://journalstar.com/news/local/bruning-charges--year-old-man-married-to--year/article_c1b22d98-517f-55e6-b003-c6108cf47568.html|publisher=Lincoln Journal Star|accessdate=2013-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a speech in August 2011, Bruning compared welfare recipients to [[raccoon]]s. Bruning said his comment might have been "inartful" but that he was trying to make a point about spending cuts being necessary.&lt;ref&gt;http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2011/08/nebraska-ag-jon-bruning-compares-welfare-recipients-to-scavenging-racoons.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Politico |url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/davidcatanese/0811/Local_TV_scorches_Bruning_for_raccoon_reference.html?showall |author=David Catanese |title=Local TV scorches Bruning for raccoon reference |date=2011-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fox News raccoon report"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nebraska Attorney General Jon Bruning Regrets Comparing Welfare Recipients to Raccoons, Aide Says|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/08/11/nebraska-ag-jon-bruning-regrets-comparing-welfare-recipients-to-raccoons-aide/|work=FoxNews.com|publisher=Fox News Channel|accessdate=12 April 2012|date=2011-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nebraska: Candidate Says He Regrets Welfare Analogy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/11/us/11brfs-Raccoon.html|accessdate=2012-04-12|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2011-08-10|agency=The Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011, the ''[[Omaha World-Herald]]'' reported that Bruning had purchased a lakeside house valued at $675,000 near the [[Platte River]] in partnership with two [[Nelnet]] executives, almost a year after he and his office had been accused of acting favorably toward the student loan company by not enforcing payment of a $1&amp;nbsp;million judgment awarded to the [[State of Nebraska]] when Nelnet was under fire for alleged improper business practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bruning owns lake house with 2 Nelnet officials |url=http://www.omaha.com/article/20110828/NEWS01/708289899/0#bruning-owns-lake-house-with-2-nelnet-officials |date=2011-08-28 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walton, Don.

In 2012, Bruning sued the Federal government of the United States over the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] with a 26 state coalition. His office led the legal challenge to the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act’s provision regarding employer-paid health insurance requirements related to abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Brien|first=Maggie|title=Bruning fights birth control rule|url=http://omaha.com/article/20120208/NEWS97/702089861|accessdate=2013-01-29|newspaper=Omaha World Herald|date=2012-02-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130216144617/http://omaha.com/article/20120208/NEWS97/702089861|archivedate=2013-02-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Bruning was fined a $19,000 civil penalty by the [[Federal Election Commission]] for campaign finance violations during his 2012 U.S. Senate election effort.&lt;ref name='Cooper01'&gt;{{cite news | first = Kent | last = Cooper | title = Email Trips Up Nebraska Attorney General, Agrees to $19,000 Penalty | date = 2013-05-16 | url = http://blogs.rollcall.com/moneyline/email-trips-up-nebraska-attorney-general-agrees-to-19000-penalty/ | work = [[Roll Call]] | accessdate = 2013-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2014, Bruning, together with Oklahoma Attorney General [[Scott Pruitt]], filed a suit in the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in which they asked that Colorado's [[Colorado Amendment 64|Amendment 64]], which legalized marijuana in that state, be struck down.  Bruning and Pruitt argued that the Colorado measure violated the [[Supremacy Clause]] of the U.S. Constitution, since the U.S. Congress had enacted the 1970 [[Controlled Substances Act]], which imposed a nationwide ban on marijuana.&lt;ref&gt;Duggan, Joe.

===U.S. Senate and gubernatorial elections===

In 2007, Bruning entered the [[United States Senate election in Nebraska, 2008|race]] for the U.S. Senate seat then held by [[Chuck Hagel]], and raised more than $1 million for his campaign.  Later that year, however, Hagel announced that he would not seek reelection; soon thereafter, former Nebraska Governor [[Mike Johanns]] joined the race for the now-open seat. Faced with an overwhelming likelihood that Johanns would win the Republican primary, Bruning withdrew from the campaign almost a year before the election.&lt;ref&gt;Blake, Aaron.

In late 2010, Bruning announced that he would run in the [[United States Senate election in Nebraska, 2012|2012 election]] for the U.S. Senate seat held by Democrat [[Ben Nelson]], whose approval ratings in Nebraska had plummeted after he provided the 60th and final vote necessary to break a Republican filibuster and pass the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]].  In December 2011, Nelson announced that he would not seek reelection. Bruning was seen as the strong front-runner in the Republican primary race; former Attorney General and current State Treasurer [[Don Stenberg]], favored by the conservative [[Tea Party movement]], was seen as his strongest challenger. Bruning and Stenberg attacked one another aggressively throughout the campaign. Shortly before the election, the [[political action committee]] Ending Spending, financed by Omaha businessman [[Joe Ricketts]], ran a television ad attacking Bruning for buying a lake house together with two executives of Lincoln student-loan firm [[Nelnet]] less than a year after Bruning, in his capacity as attorney general, had sought to waive a $1 million penalty against the company.  In the primary election, voters delivered an unexpected victory to dark-horse candidate [[Deb Fischer]], who won 41% of the vote to Bruning's 36% and Stenberg's 19%.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, Bernie.

==Immediate ancestors==
[[File:Ram Krishna Kunwar.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Sardar [[Ram Krishna Kunwar]]; great-grandfather of Jang]]

His father, Kaji [[Bal Narsingh Kunwar]], was in court the day [[Rana Bahadur Shah]] was murdered by his own half-brother Sher Bahadur Shah; as a retaliation Bal Narsingh killed him on the spot. For this action, he was rewarded with the position of ''[[Kaji (Nepal)|Kaji]]'', which was made hereditary in his family, also he was the only person allowed to carry weapons inside the court. He was the great-grandson of [[Ram Krishna Kunwar]], a great military leader at the times of King [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]].  Through his mother Ganesh Kumari, he was related to the [[aristocratic]] [[Thapa]] of PM [[Bhimsen Thapa]], which helped him enter the royal court at a young age. Through his maternal grandmother he was related to the [[aristocratic]] Pande family as his maternal grandmother Rana Kumari was the daughter of ''Kaji'' Ranajit Pande, an influential royal courtier.&lt;ref name="PurushottamShamsher1990"/&gt;

==Early life and family==
[[Bal Narsingh Kunwar]] was appointed as the bodyguard of [[Rana Bahadur Shah]]. When Shah was attacked on 24 April 1806, he was working at the same spot. Bal Narsingh Kunwar's second wife Ganesh Kumari was the sister of [[Mathabarsingh Thapa]]. Jung Bahadur was born in Langantol of Kathmandu. In those days the Thapas had influence over the administration of Nepal. From an early age, Jung Bahadur showed interest in courageous deeds. When he was 11 years old he was married to  Prasad Laxmi, the daughter of Prasad Singh on 1 May 1828. His father then went to Dhankuta and took his sons with him. In 1833, Bal Narsingh moved to [[Dadeldhura District|Dadeldhura]] where Jung Bahadur accompanied him and was admitted in the Military. When Bal Narsingh moved to [[Jumla District|Jumla]] in the year 1835, Jung Bahadur was already promoted to the rank of [[Second lieutenant]]. In 1837 when [[Bhimsen Thapa]] was dismissed, all his relatives were freed from the services. In this course, Bal Narsingh and Jung Bahadur too were dismissed from their services and their properties was seized. This incident made it difficult for Bal Narsingh to fulfill even the fundamental necessities of his large family. Jung Bahadur then went to [[Varanasi]] in search of work. There he wandered around to no avail. After a brief stay there, he returned to the [[Terai]] to work as a [[Mahout]], but there too, he couldn't achieve any success. In 1839 he returned to Kathmandu where his wife and infant son had already died.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ranashasanko Britanta|last=Rana|first=Pramod Shumsher|publisher=Pairavi Book House|year=2009|isbn=11146-30-72-5|location=Kathmandu|pages=31, 32, 44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rise ==
In 1839 Jung Bahadur was married to the daughter of [[Kaji (Nepal)|Kaji]] Sanak Singh. Jung Bahadur received decent amount of dowry from the marriage which resulted in a slight betterment in the financial condition of the family. In 1840, the King [[Rajendra of Nepal|Rajendra]] went to Terai where coincidentally Jung Bahadur was also accompanying him. There Jung Bahadur impressed the King by displaying great courage. The King was pleased with him and immediately gave him the position of Captain. After returning, Jung Bahadur was included amongst the bodyguards of the Crown Prince. Once, in the command of the Prince he had to jump into the [[Trishuli River]] riding a horse which he did and only just survived.

After a while, Jung Bahadur was transferred from the Prince's group back into the King's. There he was appointed as a Kaji and was sent to the office of Kumarichowk. There he got an opportunity to properly understand the financial transactions of Nepal.

Jung Bahadur was known to be extremely ambitious. During those days, the youngest Queen was the actual ruler of the country with King only of name. [[Gagan Singh Bhandari]] was closest to the queen. Jung Bahadur had managed to please the Queen, the Prince and the Prime Minister with his diligent efforts. He had also managed to influence Henry Lawrence and his wife Honoria Lawrence.

When Mathavar was still the Prime Minister, a cousin of Jung Bahadur was sentenced to death penalty. Jung Bahadur had requested Mathavir to convince the Queen to excuse his cousin but Mathavar denied. This had resulted in Jung Bahadur holding grudge against him.

Jung Bahadur befriended Pandit Bijayaraj who was the internal priest of the palace, and from him he started to gain valuable information about the Durbar. He had also managed to befriend Gagan Singh Bhandari.

After assassinating Mathavar Singh, the queen gave Jung Bahadur the rank of a [[General]] and included Gagan Singh in the council of ministers.

== [[Kot massacre]] ==
[[Kot massacre]]

The '''Kot massacre'''  took place on 14 September 1846 when [[Jung Bahadur|Jung Bahadur Rana]] and his brothers killed about 40 members of the [[Kingdom of Nepal|Nepalese palace court]] including the Prime Minister and a relative of the King, Chautariya [[Fateh Jung Shah]], at the palace armory (the kot) of [[Kathmandu]]. This led to the loss of power by King [[Rajendra of Nepal|Rajendra Bikram Shah]] and by [[Surendra of Nepal|Surendra Bikram Shah]] and the establishment of the [[Rana dynasty|Rana autocracy]].

By 1850 Jung Bahadur had eliminated all of his major rivals, installed his own candidate on the throne, appointed his brothers and cronies to all the important posts, and ensured that major administrative decisions were made by himself as prime minister.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Prime Minister ==
After the Massacre, on the 15th of September the Queen appointed Jung Bahadur as the Prime Minister and the [[Commander-in-chief]]. After meeting with the Queen and the King, Jung Bahadur went to meet the Resident at the British Residency. There he informed the Resident about the massacre and also convinced him that the new government will be a great friend of the English. In the 23rd of September all officers of military and bureaucracy were called upon to their respective offices within 10 days. Then, Jung Bahadur appointed his brothers and nephews to the highest ranks of the government.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== [[Bhandarkhal Massacre]] ===
The Queen commanded Jung Bahadur to remove Prince [[Surendra of Nepal|Surendra]] from the rank and declare Rajendra as the new Prince but Jung Bahadur ignored it which resulted in Queen holding vendetta against him. A few people had survived the Kot Massacre who were secretly planning to avenge Jung Bahadur. The Queen secretly contacted them and conspired to assassinate Jung Bahadur. A plan was formed to do so in a gathering to be organized in the garden of [[Bhandarkhal]] situated at the eastern end of the palace.

Jung Bahadur had already placed his spies inside the palace to gather information about the Queen and the events in the palace. These spies were handed the duty of informing Jung Bahadur about the happenings in a secret manner. A certain [[Putali Nani]] whom Jung Bahadur had already taken in his side also worked inside the palace and she informed Jung Bahadur about the conspiracy.

After receiving a command from the Queen to come to Bhandarkhal, Jung Bahadur took his fully armed troops and headed towards the garden. [[Birdhwaj]] was given the duty to bring Jung Bahadur in time. When he reached to the temple of Jor-Ganesh, he saw Jung Bahadur approaching with the troops. Sighting him, Jung Bahadur signaled Capt. Ranamehar and Ranamehar killed Birdhwaj Basnyat. The troops then marched towards Bhandarkhal where seeing Jung Bahadur approach fully armed with his troops, the conspirators started to flee. 23 people were killed in the massacre while 15 escaped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Life of Maharaja Sir Jung Bahadur Rana|last=Jung|first=Padma|publisher=|year=1909|isbn=|location=Allahabad|pages=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, everything was seized of those who had been involved in this massacre. Jung Bahadur then imprisoned the Queen. Jung Bahadur then called for a meeting of the Council in the name of King Rajendra and charged the Queen of trying to assassinate the Prince and the Prime Minister. The Council agreed upon the charges after which the Queen was freed from all her rights. The Queen asked Jung Bahadur to let her go to [[Benaras]] with all her family which Jung Bahadur agreed to. The King went alongside the Queen.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== The Battle of Alau ===
After the massacres of Kot and Bhandarkhal, the Thapas, Pande's and other citizens had settled in Benaras. Similarly, some citizens had gone to setlle in [[Nautanwa]] and [[Bettiah]]. [[Guru Prasad Shah]] of Palpa too had gone to live with the King of Bettiah. After knowing about the presence of the King and the Queen in Benaras, Guru Prasad went there and started to congregate an army and a plan to execute Jung Bahadur started to be formed.  After staying for about two months in Benaras, the King Rajendra started to show interest in the matter. The King then, appreciating the plan, met with Guru Prasad and assured him of his support for the plan. The King also provided some financial aid.

After receiving the support from the King, Guru Prasad started to organize the Nepalese people living outside the country. They started gathering people who had come in search of work and started training them.

Meanwhile, the spies in Benaras who were analyzing each step of the King were providing reports to Jung Bahadur every week. Having understood the activities going on in Benaras, Jung Bahadur called a meeting of Council where he issued a charter mentioning, ' Now we cannot obey the King, from now on we will work in accordance to the commands of the Prime Minister Jung Bahadur', and sent it to Benaras. After receiving such letter from Jung Bahadur, the King panicked and consulted with his new minister as well as his Guru.

The Guru and others suggested the King to send a letter to the Army mentioning that the troops shall assist the King not the Prime Minister. The King put his stamp in the letter and sent it with Kumbhedan and Sewakram. They secretly reached Kathmandu and stayed in the house of one owner of Killagal. The spies of Jung Bahadur captured them from the house and destroyed the house the next morning. A pistol and a letter was found from them. Immediately, they were imprisoned and after a few days were hanged till death.

On May 12, 1847, Jung Bahadur gave a speech in [[Tundikhel]]. There he accused the King of attempted assassination of the Prince and the Prime Minister. The Council then decided to dethrone King Rajendra deeming him mentally ill, and on the same day [[Surendra of Nepal|Surendra]] was crowned as the new king of Nepal.

Hearing the news of the coronation of Surendra, Rajendra decided to take the responsibility of removing Jung Bahadur upon himself and declaring himself as the leader of the army, he left Benaras. Rajendra then appointed Guru Prasad Shah as the Chief of the Army for the operation of removal of Jung Bahadur Rana from Nepal and started to accumulate weapons and training the troops. The training of the troops were done in the camp of the King of [[Bettiah]] who was a good ally of Rajendra. Along with this, some treasure and weapons were bought from secret groups in Benaras, Prayag, etc., and sent to Bettiah. The King of [[Bettiah]] also provided some arms and elephants. A plan to attack Nepal was made.

Antagonism from the [[Company rule in India|Company]] forced Rajendra and his troops to enter Nepal. On the 23rd of July, the troops reached to a village called [[Alau, Nepal|Alau]] in Bara and set a camp there. The number of troops available at Alau was around three thousand, thousand less than the number at Betiah who had fled mid-way.

One spy group of the Government of Nepal was keeping close eyes on the event of the rebel groups at Betiah. They sent the news to Jung Bahadur, immediately after which he sent a troop in the leadership of [[Sanak Singh Tandon]] to Alau. They were told to suppress the rebellions, arrest Rajendra and bring him to Kathmandu. On the 27th of July, the Gorakhnath Paltan reached and rested in a village called  [[Simraungadh]], not too far from Alau.

At dawn the next day the troops from Kathmandu started firing cannons at the camp. Great panic spread over the camp. Few armies from the King's side resisted and fought with Government forces. The former King too, for a certain period lead his troops. Guru Prasad fled from the location. Around a hundred soldiers of the King were killed in the battle and the King was captured and brought to Kathmandu.

The battle of Alau was a decisive one between the forces of King and Jung Bahadur. The King lost significantly in the battle. If the massacre of Kot had established Jung Bahadur as a dictator, the battle of Alau had helped him strengthen his dictatorship. Rajendra was imprisoned in an old palace in Bhaktapur.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Visit to Bisauli ===
Towards the end of 1848 a vicious battle waged between the British and the Sikhs in Punjab. After hearing the news, Jung Bahadur met with the Resident and assured of Nepal Government's support to the British. But the Governor-General rejected the proposal fearing the possibility of the Nepali troops diverting to the side of the Sikhs at the crucial moment. Jung Bahadur then decided to demonstrate his power to the English. He was passionate for hunting but after being the Prime Minister he had not gotten an opportunity to hunt. In 1848, Jung Bahadur planned to go to the Terai with a dual purpose, one for hunting but primarily to show-off his power to the English. In the 22nd of December, with the King and a large group alongside him, Jung Bahadur left Kathmandu. The group included thirty-two thousand soldiers on foot, fifty-two cannons, three hundred ''risalla,'' and cannons to be pulled by two hundred and fifty mules. After getting the information of this large a force nearby its boundary, the Governor-General sent a message to the Resident asking him to figure out the reality of the matter.

The King and Jung Bahadur then camped in a village called [[Bisauli]] which was not too far from the territories of the Company. But the spread of cholera and malaria, which started killing the soldiers forced them to return.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Europe ===
After the [[Treaty of Sugauli]], the British had gained access to the internal matters of Nepal. Although the previous Prime Ministers of Nepal before him had somewhat resisted the Resident's involvement in the internal matter of Nepal, Jung Bahadur was of strong opinion that neither the Resident nor the Governor-General shall have any right to show involvement in the matters of Nepal. He therefore, wanted to establish a direct relationship between the Government of Nepal and the Queen and Prime Minister of Great Britain. He also had a keen interest in understanding the real power of the British. For these ends, he desired to travel to the Great Britain.

Jung Bahadur expressed his desire to the then Resident, [[Col. Thorsby]]. Thorsby suggested Jung Bahadur to write a letter, which he did and sent it to [[Calcutta]]. The Governor-General conveyed the message to Britain where they accepted the request and also asked them (Governor-General) to manage the necessary provisions, after which, [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|James Broun-Ramsay,]] sent a letter of acceptance to Kathmandu. The visit was to be of diplomatic nature and Jung Bahadur was to visit as a Royal Ambassador.

By placing his brother [[Bam Bahadur Kunwar]] as an interim Prime Minister, [[Badri Narsingh]] as the interim Commander-in Chief, on the 15th of January Jung Bahadur left Kathmandu to Calcutta. During his stay at Calcutta, he met with the Lord and Lady Dalhouse and participated in a royal program. He also went to visit the [[Jagannath Temple, Puri|Jagannath Temple .]] On the 7th of April the Nepalese team left Calcutta in P &amp; O Heddington . The ship reached the Suez Canal through [[Madras]], [[Sri Lanka]] and Eden.

In Egypt, Jung Bahadur and the team visited Cairo and Alexandria where he met with [[Abbas Helmi I of Egypt|Abbas Helmi]] .

On 15 May 1850, the team reached Southampton.

In Britain, Jung Bahadur met and discussed various topics with Sir John Hubhouse, the Chairman of the Board of Trade, the Duke of Wellington and others. On the 19th of June Jung Bahadur and Queen Victoria met at a program organized in the Royal Palace. Jung Bahadur also visited the Parliament and closely observed the workings of the House of Commons and the British system. He visited the ministers and dukes and in one such meeting he proposed a direct relationship between the British and Nepalese, which the British Government rejected.

In Scotland, he was welcomed by [[William Johnston (Lord Provost)]]. There he visited various forts and industries.

On 21 August 1850, Jung Bahadur and the team departed towards France. There he met with the then President of France. In France too, he expressed his desire to establish a direct relationship between Nepal and France, but the French President insisted on forming the relationship through the British Embassy, as there was no diplomatic relationship between the two  countries. Jung Bahadur and the team stayed at France for about six weeks. On the 3rd of October they departed from Paris and on the 6th of November reached [[Bombay]].

In India, he married an Indian girl.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

During his visits, although he unsuccessfully tried to deal directly with the British government while he was there, the main result of the tour was a great increase in goodwill between the British and Nepal. Recognizing the power of industrialized Europe, he became convinced that close co-operation with the British was the best way to guarantee Nepal's independence.

On January 29, 1851, Jung Bahadur reached Nepal.

=== [[Muluki Ain]] ===
Jung Bahadur was highly impressed by the rule of law, the parliament and the democratic system prevalent in Britain. In Nepal during those days, there were no written Acts. Different types of punishment were given to the similar kinds of criminal acts. Realizing that the prevalent system won't work for long term in Nepal, Jung Bahadur established a ''Kausal Adda'' in order to work on Acts. Electing around two hundred members for the ''Adda'', Jung Bahadur commanded them to draft legal codes as soon as possible.

The ''adda'' began its work by carefully studying the tradition, castes, race, class as well as religious situation of Nepal. Some members also studied the [[Hindu Ain]] being used in the courts of the English in the Company. After three years of vigorous research, a detailed Act was prepared. This Act included the workings of Court, system of Punishment, and different Administrative sections. They however, could not address the issue of Caste inequality as a progressive policy on such could have resulted in protests and turmoils around the society.

On 6 January 1854, the Muluki Ain was implemented around the country of Nepal. The copies of the Act were distributed around all offices, courts. The issue of this Act freed the administrators of Nepal from the confusion that had been arising from the Religious laws. The decision on cases happened early.

Jung Bahadur, with the Muluki Ain had formed the base of Law in Nepal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Foreign relations==
[[File:Maharaj Jung London 1850 AD.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Maharaj Jung at London in 1850]]

Nepal began to experience some successes in international affairs during the tenure of Jung Bahadur. To the north, relations with [[Tibet]] had been mediated through China since Nepal's defeat in 1792, and during the early nineteenth century, embassies had to make the arduous journey to Beijing every five years with local products as a tribute to the Qing emperor. By 1854, however, China was in decline and had fallen into a protracted period of disturbances, including the [[Taiping Rebellion]] (1851–64), revolts by [[Muslim]] ethnic groups north of Tibet and war with European powers. The Nepalese mission to Beijing in 1852, just after the death of the sixth [[Panchen Lama]], was allegedly mistreated in Tibet. Because of this slight, the Nepalese government sent a protest letter to Beijing and [[Lhasa]] outlining several grievances, including excessive customs duties on Nepalese trade. In 1855 Nepalese troops overran the Kuti and Kairang areas. The [[Nepalese-Tibetan War]] lasted for about a year, with successes and failures on both sides, until a treaty negotiated by the Chinese resident and ratified in March 1856 gave Nepalese merchants duty-free trade privileges, forced Tibet to pay an annual tribute of 10,000 rupees to Nepal, and allowed a Nepalese resident in Lhasa. In return, Nepal gave up territorial gains and agreed that it, as well as Tibet, would remain a tributary state subject to China. As the [[Qing Empire]] disintegrated later in the century, this tributary status was allowed to lapse, and even Tibet began to shake off its subordination.

[[Begum Hazrat Mahal]] took refuge in [[Kathmandu Valley|Kathmandu]] with her 10-year-old son in 1859 [[Birjis Qadr]] and some other loyal staff. The then Prime Minister of Nepal, Jung Bahadur Rana, gave her shelter at the palace in Thapathali (which now houses an office of the [[Nepal Rastra Bank]], [[Thapathali Durbar]]), said [[Salim Miya Ansari|Samim Miya Ansari]]. Jung Bahadur Rana took the step despite being in good terms with the British at the time.

In 1858 [[Surendra of Nepal|King Surendra]] bestowed upon Jung Bahadur Kunwar the honorific title of Rana, an old title denoting martial glory used by [[Rajput]] princes in northern India.{{efn|He was not actually a Rajput - the claim is considered to be fictitious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fatalism and Development: Nepal's Struggle for Modernization |first=Dor Bahadur |last=Bista |publisher=Orient Blackswan |year=1991 |isbn=978-8-12500-188-1 |page=37 |url=https://books.google.com.np/books?id=JzFROpFVYRAC&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;dq=kunwar%20chhetri%20peoples&amp;pg=PA37#v=onepage&amp;q=kunwar%20chhetri%20peoples&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} He then became Jung Bahadur Rana, and the later prime ministers descended from his family added his name to their own in honour of his accomplishments. Their line became known as the house of the Ranas. Jung Bahadur remained prime minister until 1877, suppressing conspiracies and local revolts and enjoying the fruits of his early successes. He exercised almost unlimited power over internal affairs, taking for his own use whatever funds were available in the treasury. He lived in the high style of an Anglicised native prince in the British Raj, although unlike the Indian princes he was the ruler of a truly independent nation, an ally rather than a subordinate of the British.

He devised a method to assist in solving [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] messages which was dubbed '''Yoxallismus'''. After the war he worked at [[GCHQ]] until the mid-1970s.

==Early life==
Yoxall was born in [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]], and was the youngest out of four brothers.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt; His father died young in a [[rail transport|tramway]] accident.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt; Leslie Yoxall was educated at [[Manchester Grammar School]] from 1925&lt;ref name="bp-obit"&gt;"In Memoriam: Leslie Yoxall", Bletchley Park Newsletter, Spring 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sidney Sussex College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] from 1933, graduating with first-class honours. He received his doctorate in 1941.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;

On the outbreak of war, Yoxall returned to teach at [[Manchester Grammar School]],&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt; and was next in line to become the head of mathematics.&lt;ref name="sm296"&gt;Hugh Sebag-Montefiore, ''Enigma: The Battle for the Code'', 2000, {{ISBN|0-7538-1130-8}}, p. 296&lt;/ref&gt;

==Codebreaking at Bletchley Park==
In April 1941, [[Gordon Welchman]] wrote to Yoxall advising him that he would soon be asked to help with "war work".&lt;ref name="sm296"/&gt; In due course, Yoxall was invited to join Bletchley Park and was, alongside [[Bill Tutte]], interviewed by [[Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander|Hugh Alexander]] and then [[Alan Turing]].&lt;ref name="sm296"/&gt; Yoxall was selected to join the team in [[Hut 8]], working on Naval Enigma&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt; as a "temporary junior administrative officer".&lt;ref name="bp-obit"/&gt; He worked on the problem of ''Offizier'' (Officer) messages, which had been enciphered on Enigma with a second setting for additional security. Yoxall discovered what became known as "Yoxallismus", a method for recovering the Offizier setting.&lt;ref name="bp-obit"/&gt;

In October/November 1942,&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Erskine, "Breaking German Naval Enigma" in ''Action this Day'', edited by Ralph Erskine and Michael Smith, 2001, {{ISBN|0-593-04982-9}}, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; he moved to Hut 7&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt; to work on a Japanese naval cipher, making a significant contribution in identifying how the cipher permutations were constructed.&lt;ref name="bp-obit"/&gt;

==Post-war work==
After the war he moved to [[Eastcote]] and then moved again with [[GCHQ]] to [[Cheltenham]] in 1953.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt; He worked in Washington as a liaison officer from 1959 to 1963, and returned again in 1968 to 1972.&lt;ref name="bp-obit"/&gt; After the first tour in the US, a letter sent to the director of GCHQ ([[Clive Loehnis]]) stated that "his superior technical competence and analytic insight have served as a stimulus to everyone with whom he came into contact. His engaging personality, diplomacy and tact have endeared him to us all".

He retired from GCHQ around 1974 and returned to teaching, tutoring and coaching students in mathematics.&lt;ref name="bp-obit"/&gt;

'''Lucien Bonaparte, Prince Français, 1st Prince of Canino and Musignano''' (born '''Luciano Buonaparte'''; 21 May 1775 – 29 June 1840), the third surviving son of [[Carlo Bonaparte]] and his wife [[Letizia Ramolino]], was a French statesman, who served as the final President of the [[Council of Five Hundred]] at the end of the [[French Revolution]].

Lucien was a younger brother of [[Joseph Bonaparte|Joseph]] and [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]], and an older brother of [[Elisa Bonaparte|Elisa]], [[Louis Bonaparte|Louis]], [[Pauline Bonaparte|Pauline]], [[Caroline Bonaparte|Caroline]] and [[Jérôme Bonaparte]]. Lucien held genuinely revolutionary views, which led to an often abrasive relationship with his brother Napoleon, who seized control of the French government in 1799, when Lucien was 24.&lt;ref name=shom&gt;Schom, Alan, ''Napoleon Bonaparte'', (HarperCollins Publishers, 1997), pp 237, 238.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Lucien Bonaparte's rise during the French Revolution, unlike [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte's]] other siblings, was not based on familial connections or nepotism. This was one of the issues that caused friction between Lucien and Napoleon in the early years of the 19th century, as their political differences deepened. Both Lucien and Napoleon had a very keen interest in historical antiquity as youngsters.

===Youth===
Lucien was born in [[Ajaccio]], [[Corsica]] in 1775, and was educated in mainland France, at the College d'Autun, the military school in [[Brienne-le-Château|Brienne]], and at seminary in Aix-en-Provence. In 1769 the [[Corsican Republic]] had been [[French Conquest of Corsica|conquered by French forces]] and annexed into France. Lucien's father [[Carlo Bonaparte]] had been a strong supporter of Corsican patriots under [[Pasquale Paoli]], but later switched to become a supporter of French rule.

===Revolutionary activities===
[[File:AduC 253 Bonaparte (Lucien, 1775-1840).JPG|thumb|left|150px|Lucien Bonaparte]]
A 14-year-old Lucien returned to Corsica at the outbreak of the [[French Revolution]] in 1789 and became an outspoken speaker in the [[Jacobin Club]] at Ajaccio, where he renamed himself "[[Brutus]]". An ally of [[Maximilien Robespierre]] before and during the [[Reign of Terror]], he was briefly imprisoned (at [[Aix-en-Provence]]) after the coup of [[Thermidorian Reaction|9 Thermidor]] on 27 July 1794, which deposed Robespierre and led to Robespierre's execution the following day.

====President of the Council of Five Hundred====
As president of the [[Council of Five Hundred]] &amp;mdash; which he removed to the suburban security of [[Saint-Cloud]] &amp;mdash; Lucien Bonaparte was crucial with a combination of bravado and disinformation to the ''coup d'état'' of [[18 Brumaire]] (date based on the [[French Republican Calendar|French Revolutionary Calendar]]) in which Napoleon Bonaparte overthrew the government of the [[French Directory|Directory]] to replace it by the [[French Consulate|Consulate]] on 9 November 1799. Lucien mounted a horse and galvanized the [[grenadier]]s by pointing a sword at his brother and swearing to run him through if he ever betrayed the principles of ''[[Liberté, égalité, fraternité]]''. The following day Lucien arranged for Napoleon's formal election as [[First Consul]].

====Diplomacy====
Napoleon made him [[List of Interior Ministers of France|Minister of the Interior]] under the Consulate, which enabled Lucien to falsify the results of the [[French constitutional referendum, 1800|plebiscite]] but which brought him into competition with [[Joseph Fouché]], the chief of police, who showed Napoleon a subversive pamphlet that was probably written by Lucien, and effected a breach between the brothers. Lucien was sent as ambassador to the court of [[Charles IV of Spain]], (November, 1800), where his [[diplomacy|diplomatic talents]] won over the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] royal family and, perhaps as importantly, the minister [[Manuel de Godoy]].&lt;ref name=shom/&gt;

====Falling out with the Emperor====
Though he was a member of the ''[[Tribunat]]'' in 1802 and was made a senator of the [[First French Empire]], Lucien came to oppose many of Napoleon's ideas. In 1804, with Lucien disliking Napoleon's intention to declare himself as Emperor of the French and to marry Lucien off to a Bourbon Spanish princess, [[Maria Luisa of Spain, Duchess of Lucca|the Queen of Etruria]], Lucien spurned all imperial honours and went into self-imposed exile, living initially in [[Rome]], where he bought the [[Villa Rufinella]] in [[Frascati]].

==Later years==

{{House of Bonaparte}}
In 1809, Napoleon increased pressure on Lucien to divorce his wife and return to France, even having their mother write a letter encouraging him to abandon her and return. With the whole of the [[Papal States]] annexed to France and the Pope imprisoned, Lucien was a virtual prisoner in his Italian estates, requiring permission of the Military Governor to venture off his property. He attempted to sail to the United States to escape his situation but was captured by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]]. When he disembarked in Britain, he was greeted with cheers and applause by the crowd, many of whom saw him as anti-Napoleon.

The government permitted Lucien to settle comfortably with his family at [[Ludlow]], and later at Thorngrove House in [[Grimley, Worcestershire]], where he worked on a heroic poem on [[Charlemagne]]. Napoleon, believing Lucien had deliberately gone to Britain and thus a traitor, had Lucien omitted from the Imperial [[Almanach de Gotha|almanacs]] of the Bonapartes from 1811 until his 1814 abdication.

Lucien returned to France following his brother's abdication in April 1814. Lucien continued to Rome where on 18 August 1814 he was made [[Prince Canino Line|Prince of Canino]], Count of Apollino, and Lord of Nemori by [[Pope Pius VII]] and Prince of Musignano on 21 March 1824 by [[Pope Leo XII]].&lt;ref name=stroud&gt;Stroud, Patricia Tyson, ''The Emperor of Nature: Charles-Lucien Bonaparte and his world'', (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2000), pp.21; 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Hundred Days]] after Napoleon's return to France from exile in [[Elba]], Lucien rallied to his brother's cause, and they joined forces once again during Napoleon's brief return to power. His brother made him a French Prince and included his children into the Imperial Family, but this was not recognized by the Bourbons after Napoleon's second abdication. Subsequently, Lucien was proscribed at the [[Bourbon Dynasty, Restored|Restoration]] and deprived of his ''fauteuil'' at the [[Académie française]]. In 1836 he wrote his ''Mémoires''. He died in [[Viterbo]], [[Italy]], on 29 June 1840, of [[stomach cancer]], the same disease that claimed his father, his sister [[Pauline Bonaparte|Pauline]] and his brother Napoleon.&lt;ref name=stroud/&gt;

===Academic activities===
Lucien Bonaparte was the inspiration behind the Napoleonic reconstitution of the dispersed [[Académie française]] in 1803, where he took a seat. He collected paintings in ''la maison de campagne'' at [[Brienne]], was a member of [[Jeanne Françoise Julie Adélaïde Récamier]]'s [[Salon (gathering)|salon]] and wrote a novel, ''La Tribu indienne.'' He was an amateur archeologist, establishing excavations at his property in Frascati which produced a complete statue of [[Tiberius]], and at Musignano which rendered a bust of [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]]. Bonaparte owned a parcel which had once formed part of [[Cicero]]'s estate called Tusculum, and was much given to commenting on the fact. In 1825, Bonaparte excavated the so-called [[Tusculum portrait]] of [[Julius Caesar]] at the Tusculum's [[Forum (Roman)|forum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=The J. Paul Getty Museum| title =Ancient Portraits in the J. Paul Getty Museum: Volume 1| publisher =Getty Publications| year =1987| page =24| isbn =0892360712}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maksymilian Siła-Nowicki''' (9 October 1826 &amp;ndash; 30 October 1890) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[zoology]] professor and pioneer [[conservation movement|conservationist]] in [[Austria]]n [[Poland]], and father of the poet [[Franciszek Nowicki]]. He was brother-in-law to [[Jagiellonian University|Kraków University]] law professor and rector [[Franciszek Kasparek]]. 

==Career==
Nowicki began his career as a teacher in the [[countryside]] of eastern [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], and by dint of ambition and self-education eventually became a professor of [[zoology]] at [[Jagiellonian University|Kraków University]] (1863-90).&lt;ref&gt;"Siła-Nowicki, Maksymilian," ''[[Encyklopedia Polski]]'', p. 615.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1873, he was inducted into the [[Kraków]]-based [[Polish Academy of Learning|Academy of Learning]].  Also in 1873, he co-founded the [[Tatras Society]] (''[[Towarzystwo Tatrzańskie]]'').  In 1879, he founded the National Fishing Society (''[[Krajowe Towarzystwo Rybackie]]'').&lt;ref&gt;"Nowicki-Siła, Maksymilian," ''Encyklopedia powszechna PWN'', vol. 3, p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt; His greatest academic achievements were in [[entomology]], [[ichthyology]] and [[ornithology]].&lt;ref&gt;"Siła-Nowicki, Maksymilian," ''[[Encyklopedia Polski]]'', p. 615.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Nowicki sought to give a [[practical]] bent to his [[research]].  He wrote: "In the interest of [[husbandry]] in this country, it is appropriate to develop a knowledge of [[animal]]s that are harmful to husbandry... and of animals that are useful to [it]."  It was chiefly thanks to him that the [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]]n [[Sejm]] in 1868 passed a law protecting [[chamois]], [[marmot]]s and [[alpine climate|Alpine]] [[bird]]s in the [[Tatra Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;"Siła-Nowicki, Maksymilian," ''[[Encyklopedia Polski]]'', pp. 615-16.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Nowicki was the initiator of, and driving force behind, the Physiographic Commission (''Komisja Fizjograficzna'') of the [[Polish Academy of Learning|Academy of Learning]], and was a member of many other learned societies.&lt;ref&gt;"Siła-Nowicki, Maksymilian," ''[[Encyklopedia Polski]]'', p. 616.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Margaret Godolphin''' (2 August 1652 – 9 September 1678) was a British courtier. She chose [[John Evelyn]] as a mentor and died after childbirth. His account of her life was not published until 1847.

==Life==
Margaret Blagge was probably born in [[London]] on 2 August 1652 to Colonel [[Thomas Blagge]] and his wife. Her father who was a Royalist died in 1660.

In about 1666 she took on the role of [[Maid of Honour]] to [[Anne Hyde]] who was the Duchess of York. When the duchess died in 1671 she was employed in the same role by the Queen.

She chose [[John Evelyn]] as a mentor and "spiritual father" in 1672. Margaret was twenty and Evelyn was 52 and he advised her on religious learning and worship.&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;W. Calvin Dickinson, ‘Godolphin, Margaret (1652–1678)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/10880, accessed 23 Dec 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; Evelyn would write a book about her life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=9OMDAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=Mrs+Godolphin |title=The life of Mrs. Godolphin - John Evelyn, Samuel Wilberforce - Google Books |publisher=Google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She married [[Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin|Sidney Godolphin]] on 16 May 1676 when she was a maid of court.  He would later become one of the most important politicians in England.

Godolphin gave birth to [[Francis Godolphin, 2nd Earl of Godolphin|Francis Godolphin]] on the 3 September 1678 and due to complications she died in [[Whitehall]] on 9 September.

==Legacy==
Godolphin was buried at [[Breage Parish Church]] in Cornwall some days later.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; An account of her life was written by John Evelyn and this was passed down through his family to [[Edward Venables-Vernon-Harcourt]] who was the Archbishop of York. He arranged for it to be published in 1847 with the assistance of the Bishop of Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource|title=Godolphin, Margaret (DNB00)|last=|first=|year=|publisher=|page=|wspage=|scan=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Margaret Hale''' is the [[heroine]] of [[Elizabeth Gaskell]]'s 1855 novel ''[[North and South (1855 novel)|North and South]]''.  Initially, Gaskell wanted the title of the novel to be ''Margaret Hale'', but [[Charles Dickens]], the editor of ''[[Household Words]]'', the magazine in which the novel was serialized, insisted on ''North and South''.&lt;ref name="Intro"&gt;{{cite book|author=Patricia Ingham|title=North and South (Introduction)|year=1995|pages=450|publisher=Penguin Classics|isbn=978-0-14-043424-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Descriptions ==
From Chapter Two:
*"Margaret was more like him than like her mother. Sometimes people wondered that parents so handsome should have a daughter who was so far from regularly beautiful; not beautiful at all, was occasionally said. Her mouth was wide; no rosebud that could only open just enough to let out a 'yes' and 'no,' and 'an't please you, sir.' But the wide mouth was one soft curve of rich red lips; and the skin, if not white and fair, was of an ivory smoothness and delicacy. If the look on her face was, in general, too dignified and reserved for one so young, now, talking to her father, it was bright as the morning,—full of dimples, and glances that spoke of childish gladness, and boundless hope in the future."

From Chapter Seven:
*"Margaret could not help her looks; but the short curled upper lip, the round, massive up-turned chin, the manner of carrying her head, her movements, full of a soft feminine defiance, always gave strangers the impression of haughtiness."
*"She sat facing [Mr Thornton] and facing the light; her full beauty met his eye; her round white flexile throat rising out of the full, yet lithe figure; her lips, moving so slightly as she spoke, not breaking the cold serene look of her face with any variation from the one lovely haughty curve; her eyes, with their soft gloom, meeting his with quiet maiden freedom."
Margaret was a character created to challenge stereotypes about women's role in the 19th century. The theme of challenging stereotypes is one which is integral throughout the novel.

== Biography ==

Margaret Hale is nineteen years old and before she was 10, lived in Helstone in Hampshire, in the south of [[England]], with her parents—Richard, a Anglican [[Priest#Anglican or Episcopalian|minister]], and Maria—and older brother, Frederick.  When she was nine years old, Margaret was sent to live in [[London]] with her aunt, Mrs Shaw, and cousin.  Edith and Margaret were the same age, and became fast friends.

Frederick, meanwhile, joined the [[Royal Navy]]. Once at sea, he took part in a [[mutiny]] against his cruel captain. The Hales realized that Frederick,  branded a traitor, would be hanged if he ever returned to England.

When the girls grew up, Edith married Capt. Lennox.  Lennox had a younger brother, Henry, who became infatuated with Margaret.  She rejected his advances, and chose to move back to Helstone.  Mr Hale, however, had begun to question his faith and the doctrines laid out in the [[Book of Common Prayer]].  When asked to renew his vows by the bishop, Mr Hale could not.  Quitting his profession, Mr Hale moved his wife and daughter to Milton, in the north of England, where he took up work as a [[tutor#Private tutors|tutor]].

One of Mr Hale's pupils is a local mill owner, [[John Thornton (North and South)|John Thornton]]. Margaret takes an instant dislike to Thornton, seeing him as the embodiment of the harsh, working-class north.  Margaret, feeling [[homesickness|homesick]], romanticizes the south.  Mr Thornton, on the other hand, is immediately struck by Margaret.  "He did not understand who she was," when he first saw her, "as he caught the simple, straight, unabashed look, which showed that his being there was of no concern to the beautiful countenance, and called up no flush of surprise to the pale ivory of the complexion. He had heard that Mr. Hale had a daughter, but he had imagined that she was a little girl."  Margaret eventually comes to feel at home in the north; she makes friends, including Bessy Higgins, a dying young woman.

The workers in all of the mills around Milton are dissatisfied and strike.  As the strikers grow desperate, a mob of workers comes to the Thornton's house, where Margaret is calling on Mrs Thornton, John's mother, and his sister Fanny.  Thornton goes out to speak to the rioters at Margaret's behest.  Afraid that they will kill him, Margaret rushes out to Thornton.  Margaret believes that no one would try to hurt a woman, and throws her arms around Thornton, to protect him.  Margaret is mistaken, however.  A rock is thrown from the crowd by a "group of lads", and Margaret is knocked out.

Mrs Thornton, who is wary of Margaret and her son's affection for her, surmises that Margaret acted as she did out of love for Mr Thornton.  She tells her son so, and Thornton proposes to Margaret.  She insists that it was her responsibility to save him because she had sent him out to talk to the men, and that she would have done the same thing for any other "poor desperate man in that crowd".

Mrs Hale, even less happy to be in Milton than Margaret, is dying.  She wants to see Frederick one last time, so Margaret secretly writes to him in Spain, where he has been living.  Frederick comes to visit the Hales in Milton, and manages to stay hidden before she dies.  When Margaret takes Frederick to the train station, to get him out of Milton; they are seen by three people.  The first, Mr Thornton, sees Margaret with an unknown man "with whom she had stood in an attitude of such familiar confidence".  Margaret sees him watching her, and spends much of the rest of the novel bearing the guilt of having fallen from Thornton's regard.  The other man who sees the Hale siblings is a man named Leonards.  He knows that there is a bounty on Frederick's head, and tries to grab him.  The two struggle and Leonards is tripped and falls onto the side of the railroad. Fatally injured, he dies the next morning.

There is an inquest into Leonards' death.  The third person to see Margaret and her brother, a boy who works at a Milton [[Grocer|grocer's]], comes forward.  He claims to have seen Margaret with the man who fought Leonards.  Margaret does not know if her brother is still in the country.  Trying to protect Frederick, she denies having been at the train station.  Mr Thornton is a local [[magistrate]], and becomes involved in the case.  He knows that Margaret was at the station, but, still in love with her, defends her, taking over the case.  Margaret is declared innocent of any involvement in Leonards' death.  She knows that Thornton has heard her claiming not to have been at the train station.  Margaret is humbled by Thornton's deed and is acutely aware that she must now be accounted as a liar in his eyes.

Margaret and her father slowly begin to recover from Mrs Hale's death—they are helped by the news of Frederick's safe return to [[Spain]], though not by Bessy's death.  Mr Hale receives an invitation to visit an old friend, Mr Bell, in [[Oxford]].  Margaret insists that her father go; while there, however, he dies.

Margaret moves back to London, to live with Capt. and Mrs Lennox.  She is unhappy, however, and listless.  She spends much time considering the events of the past and longs to set the record straight with Thornton and win back his regard, which she believes is her only hope in repairing the damaged relationship with him. She longs for any word from Milton and, believing that she threw her one chance for happiness in marriage away, she declares to her cousin that she will never marry. She develops a close bond with Edith's [[toddler|young]] son, Sholto.  It is Margaret who disciplines the child, whereas Edith would simply spoil him, and the Lennox family appreciates this—along with their genuine love for Margaret, they encourage her to stay with them.  Edith and her mother even hint to Henry to begin wooing Margaret, again; they dream of the whole family living together, forever.

She visits Helstone with Mr. Bell, and finds herself quite disillusioned with the place she had idealised for so long. Margaret asks Mr Bell to tell Thornton about Frederick, but Mr Bell dies before he can do so. He leaves Margaret a legacy which includes Marlborough Mills and the Thornton house.

Meanwhile, Mr Thornton's cotton business has failed.  He is in London to settle his business affairs with his new landlord, Margaret. When Margaret presents Thornton with a generous business proposal that will save the mill, he realises that she is no longer indifferent or antagonistic to him. He again proposes marriage and, since she has learned to love him, she accepts.

==Television Adaptations==
North and South has been adapted for the small screen, twice.  In 1975, [[Rosalind Shanks]] played Margaret.  In 2004, Margaret was [[North and South (2004 TV serial)|played]] by [[Daniela Denby-Ashe]].

'''Massinissa Guermah''' (1983, in [[Beni Douala]], [[Tizi Ouzou Province]] &amp;ndash; 20 April 2001) was an 18-year-old [[Kabyle people|Kabyle]] ([[Berbers|Berber]]) high school student arrested by [[Algeria]]n [[Gendarmerie|gendarmes]] on 18 April 2001. In circumstances still not clear, he received gunshot wounds inside the [[gendarmerie]]. The same day, three college students were arbitrarily arrested in the town of Amizour ([[Béjaïa]]). Massinissa later died of his wounds in the Mustapha Hospital on 20 April 2001.

On 22 April 2001,  the commander of La Gendarmerie Nationale released a statement in which he said that Massinissa Guermah had been arrested after aggressive behaviour following a theft. The Interior Minister [[Yazid Zerhouni]] described Guermah as a "twenty-six year old delinquent."  In response to the Interior Minister's statement, Massinissa's parents sent the national press a school report stating that the Massinissa was indeed an eighteen-year-old school student.

Seven days after Massinissa's death the military authorities explained how it had occurred. Constable Mestari Merabet was referred to the Blida Military Tribunai for "breach of instructions and manslaughter." But the incident was described as an accident caused when Merabet accidentally fired his gun. However, according to Koceila Merakeb who was arrested with Massinissa one round of bullets was fired in the waiting room, two bullets ricocheted off the floor and the third landed at the feet of another constable close by. Then Constable Mestari Merabet directed his gun at Massinissa and fired.

Despite this evidence to date no public trial has occurred.

Massinissa's killing caused riots in [[Kabylie]] lasting for several months; this series of events is referred to as the [[Black Spring (Kabylie)|Black Spring]]. The violence was fuelled by an Algerian national campaign to impose Arabic language on its people in place of indigenous languages, including Kabyle.

'''Michael 'Mike' Parker Pearson''', [[Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London|FSA]], [[Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland|FSA Scot]], [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] (born 26 June 1957)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whoswho/U258069 PARKER PEARSON, Prof. Michael George], ''Who's Who 2014'', A &amp; C Black, 2014; online edn, Oxford University Press, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; is an English [[archaeology|archaeologist]] specialising in the study of the [[Neolithic British Isles]], [[Madagascar]] and the archaeology of death and burial, and is known for his catchphrase "The Dead Don't Bury Themselves". A professor at the [[UCL Institute of Archaeology]], he previously worked for 25 years as a professor at the [[University of Sheffield]] in England, and was the director of the [[Stonehenge Riverside Project]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/archaeology/people/parker | publisher= [[University of Sheffield]] | title= Professor Michael Parker Pearson | work= Department of Archaeology | accessdate= 22 December 2011 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; A prolific author, he has also written a variety of books on the subject.

Parker Pearson gained his BA in archaeology from [[Southampton University]] in 1979. Supervised by [[Ian Hodder]] as a post-graduate at Cambridge, Parker Pearson was a contemporary of Sheena Crawford, [[Daniel Miller (anthropologist)|Daniel Miller]], [[Henrietta Moore]], [[Christopher Tilley]] and Alice Welbourn; these students were influenced by Hodder's ideas, then a pioneering part of the [[Post-processual archaeology|post-processualist]] current within [[archaeological theory]]. He went on to gain his PhD at the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1985, producing a thesis on burials and [[bog bodies]] in Iron Age Denmark.

A media personality, Parker Pearson has appeared several times in the Channel 4 show ''[[Time Team]]'' in particular in one looking at the excavation of [[Durrington Walls]]. He also appeared in the National Geographic Channel documentary ''Stonehenge Decoded'', along with the PBS programme "[[Nova (TV series)|NOVA]]: Secrets of Stonehenge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.studenthandouts.com/01-Web-Pages/Books-Films/Reviews/2010-pbs-nova-secrets-of-stonehenge-video-review-guide.htm | title= 'Secrets of Stonehenge' from PBS's Nova Television Series (2010) | accessdate= 2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Parker Pearson was born in 1957.&lt;ref name="Parker Pearson, Michael 1957"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n93-14798 | title= Parker Pearson, Michael 1957– | publisher= OCLC Online Computer Library Center, Inc.  | work= WorldCat Identities | accessdate= 22 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would later inform interviewers that he first took an interest in the past when searching for [[fossils]] in his father's driveway gravel aged 4, extending that interest into the human past aged 6 when he read a library book entitled ''Fun with Archaeology''.&lt;ref name="PagansForArchaeology"&gt;[[#Par10|Yewtree and Parker Pearson 2010]].&lt;/ref&gt; Deciding to study the subject at the undergraduate level, he attended the [[University of Southampton]], attaining a first class BA with honours in Archaeology in 1979.&lt;ref name="UCL"&gt;[[#UCL|UCL 2012]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Parker Pearson became interested in [[Marxism]]. In the 1984 anthology ''Ideology, Power and Prehistory'', edited by Daniel Miller and Christopher Tilley, Parker Pearson published a paper in which he examined the pre-state societies of Jutland from a Marxist perspective. At the start of this paper, he noted that it had repurcussions for Marxism in that its findings discerned "a certain blurring between capitalism and non-capitalism."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Par84|Parker Pearson 1984]]. p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; He obtained his PhD from [[King's College, Cambridge|King's College]], [[University of Cambridge]] in 1985, for a thesis which he had titled "Death, society and social change: the Iron Age of southern Jutland 200 BC – 600 AD" in which he discussed what was known about the [[bog bodies]] of Denmark; it would remain unpublished.&lt;ref name="UCL"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Par99|Parker Pearson 1999]]. p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MPP 2011"/&gt;

==Early career==
From 1984 through to 1990, Parker Pearson worked as an Inspector of Monuments for [[English Heritage]],&lt;ref name="UCL"/&gt; and in 1989 he received membership to the [[Institute for Archaeologists]].&lt;ref name="UCL"/&gt; In 1990, he secured an academic teaching position at the Department of Archaeology at the [[University of Sheffield]], where he would work for the next 21 years.&lt;ref name="UCL"/&gt; In 1991 he was admitted as a Fellow of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]], and in 1996 then became a Fellow of the [[Society of Antiquaries of Scotland]].&lt;ref name="UCL"/&gt;

==Stonehenge Riverside Project and UCL==
From 2003 through to 2009, Parker Pearson directed the [[Stonehenge Riverside Project]]. The project garnered three major archaeological awards: the Andante Travel Archaeology Award (2008), the Royal Society of Northern Antiquaries Award (2009), and the UK Archaeological Research Project of the Year (2010).&lt;ref name="UCL"/&gt; His work in leading the project also led to Parker Pearson being personally awarded the UK Archaeologist of the Year award in 2010.&lt;ref name="UCL"/&gt;

Parker Pearson and his team of researchers played a key role in the discovery of a new henge site along the [[River Avon, Hampshire|River Avon]] that links to [[Stonehenge]]. This new site was uncovered through excavation during the Stonehenge Riverside Project and was given the name "[[Bluestonehenge]]" or "Bluehenge" because traces of [[bluestones]] were found during the [[excavation (archaeology)|excavation]].

From 2006 through to 2009, he served as the Vice-President of the [[Prehistoric Society]].&lt;ref name="UCL"/&gt; Interacting with various parts of the media, Parker Pearson has published articles in a variety of different sources, such as on the [[BBC]] website,&lt;ref name="MPP 2011"&gt;[[#Par11|Parker Pearson 2011]],&lt;/ref&gt; has given interviews to groups such as Pagans for Archaeology&lt;ref name="PagansForArchaeology"/&gt; and most recently discussed his career in an interview with [[Papers from the Institute of Archaeology]].&lt;ref name="PIA"&gt;Williams and Koriech 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Parker Pearson left the University of Sheffield and began teaching at the [[UCL Institute of Archaeology|Institute of Archaeology]], [[University College London]], as Professor of British Later Prehistory.&lt;ref name="UCL"/&gt;

On 16 July 2015, he was elected a [[Fellow of the British Academy]] (FBA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=British Academy Fellowship reaches 1,000 as 42 new UK Fellows are welcomed|url=http://www.britac.ac.uk/news/news.cfm/newsid/1292|website=British Academy|accessdate=17 July 2015|date=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mohamed Iguerbouchène'''; also Georges M. Iguerbouchen (Francophile name), Mohamed Ygerbuchen (as screen credited), Mohamed Ben Saïd Iquerbouchen, {{Lang-ber|Muḥand Igerbucen}}; (13 November 1907 – 23 August 1966) was an Algerian composer.

==Early life==
Mohamed Iguerbouchène was the oldest of 14 children{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} born to Saïd ben Ali and Sik Fatma bent Areski. He attended a primary school in [[Algiers]]. For his secondary education, he claimed to have studied music theory at a Norton College, in London.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} When he was 15, he crossed paths with Earl Fraser Roth, who found himself inspired by the obvious talent of the young Mohamed and decided to help him in his further studies. In 1922, with the generosity of Fraser Ross, Mohamed traveled to [[Manchester]], where he enrolled in the [[Royal Manchester College of Music]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Training==
Iguerbouchène attended the prestigious [[University of Music and Performing Arts, Vienna|Imperial Academy of Music]] in 1924 in Vienna for one year.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} In 1925, at the age of 18, he performed his first concert in [[Bregenz]], [[Lake Constance]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} He exhibited his talent chaining works of his own directory like ''Kabylia Rapsodie n. 9'' and ''Arabic rapsodie n. 7''. The culmination of his early years of work resulted in his winning his first prize of harmony, counterpoint, and piano instrumentation. In 1934, after several successful symphonies, Mohamed was introduced to the [[Société des auteurs, compositeurs et éditeurs de musique]] (SACEM) as a songwriter, and in that same year he was also introduced as a member of the [[Société des Auteurs et Compositeurs Dramatiques]] (SACD).

Iguerbouchène was fluent in 18 languages including Russian and Japanese.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} In France, at the [[Institut national des langues et civilisations orientales|école normale des langues orientales de Paris]], he was a student of Professor Destaing, where he studied [[Tamahaq]], [[Tachawit]] and [[Tashelhit]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Career==
After some time, Iguerbouchène shifted his focus to compose for the cinema as opposed to symphonic music. After a few documentaries (Aziza) and a short film (Dzair), [[Julien Duvivier]] asked him to collaborate for the soundtrack of ''[[Pépé le Moko]]'', a film whose main role was played by [[Jean Gabin]]. This film was the catalyst behind Mohamed's career as a film composer. The two artists shared the composition of the soundtrack in association with [[Vincent Scotto]]. (On the film's credits his name appeared as "Mohamed Ygerbuchen".)

In 1938, he met the singer [[Salim Halali]] in Paris (who was originally from Annaba), who helped Mohamed to compose fifty songs,{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} mainly in an Arabic Flamenco style. The collaboration was successful in Parisian clubs and they also toured the rest of Europe.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} They were in particular very popular in North Africa.

Following his approach to the BBC, in 1939 it broadcast one of his orchestral works, a 'Moorish Rhapsody', which was conducted by Charles Brill.&lt;ref&gt;[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/page/ece3531331f346819daca810261459dc Friday National,''Radio Times'', 2 June 1939]&lt;/ref&gt; Some listeners thought that he was a Russian composer, which earned him the nickname Igor Bouchen.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} In 1938, he composed songs with Vincent Scotto for the film ''[[Algiers (film)|Algiers]]''. Because of Iguerbouchène's success in music direction, he was hired in 1940 by Paris Mondial to compose music for 20 short films for Mercier Film Inc. film studios. In early 1945, he composed about 100 songs based on poems in Thousands Nights by [[Rabindranath Tagore]]. In 1946, he composed music for, ''Les plongeurs du désert'' by Tahar Hannache.

==Later years==
Iguerbouchène composed for the 1962 French short ''Le songe de chevaux sauvages'', directed by [[Albert Lamorisse]] about wild horses in France.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2167">'''Muhammad ibn Qasim''' was an [[Alid]] [[Imam]].

==Background==
Qasim led an Alid rebellion that took place in [[Taloqan]] at the beginning of the 3rd century of Hijrah (A.H.), in the year 219 A.H (834 C.E.), during the days of the [[Abbasid]][[Caliphate]] of [[Al-Mu'tasim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mapsofindia.com/history/battles/arab-invasion-of-sind-under-mohammed-bin-qasim.html|title=The Arab Invasion of Sind under Mohammed-bin-Qasim|website=www.mapsofindia.com|accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capture and escape==
However, Al-Mu'tasim defeated and arrested him and carried him to [[Baghdad]], detaining him in his palace. Shortly after, Muhammad was able to run away and flee, and was never heard of again.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=h9yluZH7dGIC&amp;pg=PT12&amp;lpg=PT12&amp;sig=aF9wVQbVQ_watFBOVbRFpMufL5c&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiLw97gwNTZAhUNwGMKHUAJDwYQ6AEIUTAH#v=onepage&amp;q=Muhammad%20ibn%20Qasim%20was%20never%20heard%20from%20again|title=Raptor Force: Holy Fire|last=Yenne|first=Bill|date=2007-02-06|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9781440622809|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Due to the unknown nature of his disappearance, people differed about his affair. Some people believed he died or fled, while some of the [[Shia|Shiites]] believed he was alive and would reappear and that he was the [[Mahdi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.indiatvnews.com/news/india/know-how-the-first-muslim-invader-muhammad-bin-qasim-died-45667.html|title=Know how the first Muslim invader Muhammad bin Qasim died after killing Raja Dahir|date=29 December 2014|publisher=|accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nahum Benari''' ({{lang-he-n|נַחוּם בֶּנאֲרִי}}) (January 3, 1893 – December 24, 1963) was an Israeli writer and an intellectual. He is known mainly for promoting many Israeli cultural initiatives, primarily in the 1940s-50s, through his position as a member of the management body of the [[Histadrut]] (abbreviation for lit. The General Federation of Laborers in the Land of Israel).

Benari was a prolific writer, who wrote on several subjects in various genres: treatises, pamphlets, plays, and more; about [[kibbutz]] and [[Zionism|Zionist]] ideals and practices; about the making of ceremonies and festivals for Sabbath, holidays, and memorial days; about philosophy; and about stories and thoughts aroused by the day to day reality of the [[yishuv]] and Israel in its first years. Moreover, he translated books of other authors and edited books and journals.&lt;ref&gt;Benari's knowledge of Hebrew grammar and vowelization rules brought poets to consult him on those matters.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a man of creative imagination who could translate ideas and thoughts about culture and education into actions.&lt;ref&gt;''איש הדמיון היוצר'', רשימה לזכרו של בנארי, מאת א. תרשיש — עיתון ''למרחב'', January 1, 1964 page 2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
=== Early life in Ukraine ===
Benari was born Nahum Brodski in 1893, in the Jewish part of the town of [[Lebedyn]] in [[Ukraine]], then part of the [[Russian Empire]]. His father, Arie Leib, held a senior position at a sugar factory, and his mother, Devora, was a housewife; he was their firstborn of ten children. As an adolescent he was sent to learn in a [[yeshiva]] (a religious school), but the studies of [[Halakha]] (religious laws) didn't satisfy his curiosity. He moved from yeshiva to yeshiva across Ukraine until he arrived at [[Odessa]], where he attended the yeshiva of Rabbi Chaim Tchernowitz (Rav Tza'ir)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0019_0_19663.html Rabbi Chaim Tchernowitz (Rav Tza'ir)] in the Jewish Virtual Library&lt;/ref&gt; and graduated in 1911. Among his teachers in this yeshiva were well-known authors such as [[Hayim Nahman Bialik]] and [[Mendele Mocher Sforim]], and there he absorbed [[Zionism|Zionist]] values, which he passed on to his brothers and sisters.&lt;ref&gt;חוברת '''רשימות''', מרדכי בנארי, הוצאת קיבוץ יגור, page 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First years in the Land of Israel ===
In May 1914, a few months before the beginning of the [[World War I|First World War]], Benari arrived in the [[Land of Israel]], then part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. During the first years after making [[Aliyah]], he hired himself out as a farm worker, first at [[Degania Alef|Degania]] and then at [[Ilaniya]]. In those years he became acquainted with immigrants of the [[Second Aliyah]] and [[Third Aliyah]]. He wrote the article "HaKabtzanim HaSmechim" (lit. The Happy Beggars) about this period.&lt;ref&gt;ספר '''העלייה השנייה'''  וספר '''כאן על פני האדמה''', page 93.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period he also met his first wife, Sonia Dubnov, with whom he had three children.

After the First World War, at the time of the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate for Palestine]], he moved with his family to wherever he could find a job: he planted trees on [[Mount Carmel]], served as a court clerk in [[Tel Aviv]], and took on some temporary jobs in [[Jerusalem]]. While working as a court clerk he wrote the article "Inyanei Beit Din" (lit. court matters). During this period his brothers and sisters made Aliyah along with their mother; most of them settled in the rural Israeli settlements called Kibbutzim (plural of [[Kibbutz]]).&lt;ref&gt;חוברת '''בנארים''' לתולדות המשפחה, עין-חרוד, October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1922, after hearing of his father's death, he changed his surname to Benari (Hebrew: בֶּנאֲרִי, lit. lion's son); his brothers and sisters followed him in this act.&lt;ref&gt;''סבתא'' רשימה מאת [[גרשון שופמן]], '''כתבים''' Vol. 3, page 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Living at Ein Harod ===
At the beginning of 1925, Benari and his family joined a kibbutz named [[Ein Harod]]. He worked in the fields and in the vineyard. At Ein Harod he was among those who conceived the Kibbutz's way of celebrating Jewish holidays. A main theme in the newly designed festivals and ceremonies was the agricultural year circle. For example, at [[Passover]] they established a ceremony for the beginning of the harvest, and at [[Shavuot]] a secular celebration of [[Bikkurim (Talmud)|Bikkurim]] (Hebrew: ביכורים, lit. first fruits). Benari also edited the periodical MiBifnim (Hebrew: [[:he:מבפנים|מבפנים]], lit. from the inside). The periodical of the kibbutzim organization [[HaKibbutz HaMeuchad]] (lit. the unified kibbutz or [[Kibbutz Movement|united kibbutz]]), stemmed from Ein Harod's journal. Benari lived in Ein Harod until 1942, and there he met his second wife, Yehudit Mensch, with whom he had one son.

=== Hechalutz activity ===
Benari was sent abroad on [[Hechalutz]] missions three times. In the years 1927-1929 he was sent by Ein Harod's leadership to Hechalutz center in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]]. During those two years, he lectured to and talked with young Jews in towns and Chavot [[Hakhshara|Hachshara]] (lit. training farms), in Poland, [[Germany]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Czech Republic|The Czech Republic]]. Additionally, he edited Hechalutz's journal called HeAtid (Hebrew: העתיד, lit. The Future). Between 1934-1936 he was sent for the second time by Ein Harod's leadership to the Hechalutz center in Warsaw, this time he also acted as a delegate to the 19th [[World Zionist Congress|Zionist Congress]] at [[Lucerne]], [[Switzerland]]. In the latter part of [[World War II|the Second World War]], from October 1944 to January 1945, he went on his third mission. This time he was sent with two other men by [[Solel Boneh]], a construction company, to join its work teams in the oil refineries in [[Abadan, Iran|Abadan]], [[Iran]]. Benari went as a social consultant, but he actually operated undercover as a Hechalutz emissary to encourage Zionist activity among the Jewish communities in Iran, [[Iraq]], and [[Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;''נשאר באזור'', רשימה מאת [[חיים באר]], גיליון '''דבר השבוע''' March 29, 1991, page 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside performing missions abroad, Benari was also a pamphleteer of Hechalutz and the Zionist ideology.

== Associations for Culture and Education ==
At the beginning of 1942, Benari left Ein Harod with his family in order to focus on his cultural and educational activities. First he worked for Solel Boneh, but it wasn't long before he joined The Center of Culture and Education of the Histadrut. He was among the founders of Associations for Culture and Education (Hebrew: מפעלי תרבות וחינוך) and ran it for nearly twenty years. In this office he promoted many cultural initiatives by supplying funds and an organizational roof. Among the most eminent associations that were raised under his service were:
#'''[http://www.omanut-laam.co.il/english/home.asp Omanut Laam Association]''' (Hebrew: אמנות לעם, lit. culture for the people) - An association, founded as Telem, which connected established theaters with peripheral and rural settlements and workers' committees.
#'''Cinema Department''' - A department that distributed selected movies, in [[16 mm film]], to all periphery communities and military camps, thus enabling movie screening everywhere.
#'''Artists and intellectuals meetings with workmen''' - Arranging meetings between all kinds of artists (such as authors, poets, painters, and sculptors) or thinkers and the workmen of different places such as industrial plants, agriculture based communities (kibbutz and [[moshav]]), immigrant camps ([[Ma'abarot]]), and military camps.
#'''Israeli Institute for Education by Correspondence''' (Hebrew name (acronym): Mishlav) - An institute that preceded the foundation of the [[Open University of Israel]].
#'''Sifri''' (Hebrew: ספרי, lit. my book) - A publishing house and a book store.
#'''Folk dancing class''' - This class gave a stage to choreographers of folk dances who used the folk music of the time. This class established the foundations for widening folk dancing activity in Israel, an activity existing to this day.

Alongside enabling the formation of new cultural establishments, the Associations for Culture and Education, under Benari management, also supported existing foundations such as HaOhel Theater (Hebrew: האהל, lit. The Tent), The Israeli Opera, [[Inbal Dance Theater]], and [[Am Oved]] publishing house.

He was the main presenter of [[Fuji TV]]'s morning TV magazine show ''[[Mezamashi TV]]'' from its start in 1994 until he left the show November 2011 due to illness.&lt;ref name="tokyograph20111106"/&gt;

==Early life and education==
Otsuka was born in Tokyo on 28 September 1948.&lt;ref name="waseda20091105"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.waseda.jp/student/weekly/contents/2009b/1200/200d.html|title= OG・OBインタビュー　フリーアナウンサー　大塚 範一さん|trans-title=Alumnus Interview: Freelance presenter Norikazu Otsuka|date= 5 November 2009|work= Waseda Weekly|publisher= Student Affairs Division, Waseda University|location= Japan|language= Japanese|archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate= 10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, he graduated from [[Waseda University]], Department of Political Science and Economics.&lt;ref name="waseda20091105"/&gt;

==Career==
Immediately after graduating from university in 1973, Otsuka started work at [[NHK]], working at various regional offices, including [[Takamatsu, Kagawa|Takamatsu]], [[Hiroshima]], and [[Nagoya]], over a period of eleven years before being transferred to Tokyo.&lt;ref name="waseda20091105"/&gt; There, he presented TV programmes such as {{Nihongo|''Sunday Sports Special''|サンデースポーツスペシャル}} and {{Nihongo|''Quiz 100 points Full Marks''|クイズ百点満点}}, as well as working as a commentator for baseball, football, and tennis broadcasts.&lt;ref name="waseda20091105"/&gt;

He left NHK in March 1994, and began presenting [[Fuji TV]]'s ''[[Mezamashi TV]]'' morning show from April 1994.&lt;ref name="waseda20091105"/&gt;

Otsuka took a break from presenting ''Mezamashi TV'' in November 2011 to undergo treatment for [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]].&lt;ref name="tokyograph20111106"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tokyograph.com/news/announcer-otsuka-norikazu-diagnosed-with-leukemia|title= Announcer Otsuka Norikazu diagnosed with leukemia|date= 6 November 2011|work= Tokyograph|archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate= 10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2012, it was announced that Otsuka would be formally leaving the programme as of April 2012.&lt;ref name="nikkan20120228"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nikkansports.com/entertainment/news/f-et-tp0-20120228-910087.html|script-title=ja:闘病中の大塚キャスター「めざまし」卒業|trans-title=Otsuka to leave "Mezamashi TV" due to illness|date= 28 February 2012|work= Nikkan Sports|publisher= Nikkan Sports News|location= Japan|language= Japanese|archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate= 10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was released from hospital in October 2012, and made a live appearance on ''Mezamashii TV'' on 4 February 2013, after 15 months away from the screen.&lt;ref name="dailysports20130204"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://daily.co.jp/gossip/illness/2013/02/04/0005719793.shtml|script-title=ja:大塚キャスター４６１日ぶり生出演|trans-title=Otsuka makes live appearance for first time in 461 days|date= 4 February 2013|work= Daily Sports Online|publisher= Daily Sports|location= Japan|language= Japanese|archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate= 10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this appearance, Otsuka revealed that he would be returning to work at Fuji TV, presenting a new afternoon magazine show, {{Nihongo|''Ageru TV''|アゲるテレビ|}}, from April 2013.&lt;ref name="dailysports20130204"/&gt; However, in March of the same year, it was revealed that Otsuka's leukemia had relapsed, and that he would not be presenting the show.&lt;ref name="dailysports20130316"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.daily.co.jp/newsflash/gossip/2013/03/16/0005818584.shtml|script-title=ja:大塚範一キャスター、白血病を再発|trans-title=Otsuka suffers a relapse of leukemia|date= 16 March 2013|work= Daily Sports Online|publisher= Daily Sports|location= Japan|language= Japanese|archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate= 10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was terminated at the end of September 2013, after just six months on the air.&lt;ref name="nikkansports20130316"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nikkansports.com/entertainment/news/f-et-tp0-20130730-1165119.html|script-title=ja:フジ系「アゲるテレビ」９月打ち切り|trans-title=Fuji TV to cancel "Ageru TV" in September|date= 30 July 2013|work= Nikkan Sports|publisher= Nikkan Sports News|location= Japan|language= Japanese|archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate= 10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ukrainian parliamentary election, 1998|1998, he was elected]] to [[Verkhovna Rada|parliament]] as a member of [[Hromada (political party)|Hromada]] but after the [[Pavlo Lazarenko#Imprisonments and trials|scandal around Lazarenko]], he left the faction and party (during May 1999) together with Yulia Tymoshenko's [[All-Ukrainian Union "Fatherland"]]. He was re-elected to parliament in 2002 and 2006 as part of the [[BYuT]].

On 4 February 2005, Turchynov was appointed and served as the first‐ever civilian head of the [[Security Service of Ukraine]] (SBU). With the approval of Turchynov as the head of the SBU, he dissolved the investigation team that was investigating the [[Georgiy Gongadze]] case since 2002. According to the first deputy head of the Main Investigation Department of the [[Prosecutor General of Ukraine|Prosecutor General's Office of Ukraine]] Roman Shubin, Turchynov ordered not to provide operational data on the Gongadze case to the investigation group of the Security Service of Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://podrobnosti.ua/308083-genprokuratura-ljudi-turchinova-dezinformirujut-obschestvennost.html |title=Генпрокуратура: Люди Турчинова дезинформируют общественность |publisher=podrobnosti.ua |language=ru |date=25 April 2006 |accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Дело Гонгадзе: Пукач скрывается в Украине? |url=http://www.segodnya.ua/ukraine/delo-honhadze-pukach-ckryvaetcja-v-ukraine.html |work=[[Segodnya]] |language=ru |date=16 November 2007 |accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://zn.ua/LAW/avantyury_diletantov.html |title=Авантюры дилетантов |work=[[Dzerkalo Tyzhnia]] |language=ru |date=28 April 2006 |accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2007, Turchynov replied to the accusation that his stance on [[same-sex marriage]] is typically conservative, "I do not agree. If a man has normal views, then you label him a conservative, but those who use drugs or promote [[sodomy]], you label them a progressive person.

In an interview with the [[BBC]], Turchynov admitted that in 2014, when the first volunteers went to war, he was personally giving them weapons, but not all were clean in the eyes of the law: "And I personally signed the orders for the weapons, many were worried about what would happen if they did not follow those orders with a weapons. Indeed, we didn't check anyone at that time, if they were convicted previously or not – whoever said that they are ready to defend the country, signed up, received weapons and went to the East of our country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/russian/features-39567526|title=Александр Турчинов: "Наша задача — продвигаться на восток"|publisher=[[BBC]]|author=Svyatoslav Khomenko, Vyacheslav Shramovich|date=14 April 2017|accessdate=22 June 2018|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.segodnya.ua/ukraine/turchinov-rasskazal-kak-v-nachale-voyny-vooruzhal-ugolovnikov-1012898.html|title=Турчинов рассказал, как в начале войны вооружал уголовников|publisher=''[[Segodnya]]''|date=14 April 2017|accessdate=22 June 2018|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fakty.ictv.ua/ru/ukraine/20170414-turchynov-ya-vidkryvav-sklady-zi-zbroyeyu-bo-ofitsery-vidmovylysya/|title=Турчинов об АТО: Я открывал склады с оружием, потому что офицеры отказались|publisher=[[ICTV (Ukraine)|ICTV]]|date=14 April 2017|accessdate=22 June 2018|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 September 2014, he said that Russia doesn't admits that their soldiers are fighting in Ukraine. He also stated that Russia is the main aggressor and that during the conflict his nation have lost over 1,000 lives with 100s missing. During the same [[Facebook]] message he compared the conflict to the butterflies, a metaphor to one of [[Ray Bradbury]]'s works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Segodnya]]|date=21 September 2014|url=http://www.segodnya.ua/regions/donetsk/turchinov-rossiya-cinichno-ne-priznaet-pered-svoim-narodom-chto-ih-soldaty-voyuyut-v-ukraine-553947.html|title=Турчинов: Россия цинично не признает перед своим народом, что их солдаты воюют в Украине|trans-title=Turchynov: Russia cynically doesn't admit in front of its people, that their soldiers are fighting in Ukraine|accessdate=26 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business activity==
On 10 September 2014, Oleksandr Turchynov published a letter in which he urged retailers to take a closer look at the products of ''Tarasove Dzherelo'', a small producer of [[mineral water]]. He proposed to conclude deals with that company. Some market experts assessed the actions of Turchinov as [[Lobbying|lobbyism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://forbes.net.ua/business/1380190-marketing-agentstvo-rada-kak-aleksandr-turchinov-prodvigaet-chastnogo-proizvoditelya-vody | title = Маркетинг-агентство «Рада»: как Александр Турчинов продвигает частного производителя воды | publisher = ''[[Forbes]]'' | author = Bohdan Khlymonenko | date = 3 October 2014 | accessdate = 9 August 2018 | language = ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Investigative journalism|journalistic investigation]], Turchinov's [[mother-in-law]], Tamara Beliba, owns the largest data center in the [[Baltic states]] — ''MC-office''. Beliba owns the ''Ekonomikos Institutas'' company, which owns a data center located in [[Kaunas]], [[Lithuania]].

According to the ''United State Register of Legal Entities, Individual Entrepreneurs and Public Organizations'' of Ukraine, the entire business in the Turchynov family is executed on his mother-in-law Tamara Beliba, mother Valentina and wife Anna. The family is engaged in economic research, film production, providing communication services and building data centres.

On 1 May 2017, the journalistic investigation of the program ''Our money with Denis Bigus'' (channel ''24'') proved the connection between Oleksandr Turchynov and people's deputy Ruslan Lukyanchuk with three large companies (''Absolut Finance'', ''Magnate'' and ''Octave Finance'') that own 1,200 exchange points of 3,500 legal [[Bureau de change|currency exchange offices]] in Ukraine. These points exchanged currencies without [[cash register]]s, which violates the requirements of the law, since in this case automatic tax reporting is not provided to the [[State Fiscal Service (Ukraine)|State Fiscal Service]]. All these companies are listed on the nominees — Oksana and Ilona Brodovskaya and Hryhoriy Pron'ko (Oksana's father). However, their connection with the joint business of Turchinov and Lukyanchuk was proved by journalists — Oksana and her husband Valentin Brodovsky were assistants of Ruslan Lukyanchuk during four convocations of the Verkhovna Rada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://24tv.ua/komu_nalezhat_punkti_obminu_valyut_i_chomu_podatkova_ne_bachit_podatkiv_nardepa_n812815 | title = Кому належать пункти обміну валют і чому податкова "не бачить" податків нардепа | publisher = TV-channel 24 | language = uk | date = 1 May 2017 | accessdate = 27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://ru.tsn.ua/politika/smi-svyazali-s-turchinovym-i-lukyanchukom-obmenniki-sovladelicey-kotoryh-yavlyaetsya-23-letnyaya-model-852620.html | title = СМИ связали с Турчиновым и Лукьянчуком обменники, совладелицей которых является 23-летняя модель | publisher = ''TSN'' | language = ru | date = 3 May 2017 | accessdate = 27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://korrespondent.net/ukraine/3847337-obmennye-punkty-turchynova-yzbehauit-nalohovoi-smy | title = Обменные пункты Турчинова избегают налоговой — СМИ | publisher = Корреспондент.net | language = ru | date = 4 May 2017 | accessdate = 27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigations on this subject were published in the Ukrainian media earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://strana.ua/articles/analysis/24464-kak-okruzhenie-turchinova-monopolizirovalo-rynok-obmena-valyut.html | title = Какое отношение имеет Турчинов к обменным пунктам в Украине | publisher = «[[Страна.ua]]» | language = ru | date = 27 July 2016 | accessdate = 27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
In June 2003, the Deputy Prosecutor General of Ukraine [[Viktor Shokin]] announced his intention to send the proposal to the [[Verkhovna Rada|Ukrainian Parliament]] an idea to bringing to trial the deputies Alexander Turchinov, Stepan Khmara and Nikolai Rudkovsky. According to Shokin, the People's deputies were insulting and beating the staff of the [[Lukyanivska Prison]]. Deputies demanded the release of Gennady Tymoshenko and Antonina Bolyura. They were incriminated with three cases of the [[Law of Ukraine#Criminal law|Criminal code]]: "Capturing state buildings", "Threat to law enforcement officers", and "Excess of power with the use of weapons and verbal insulting of law enforcement officers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://podrobnosti.ua/65670-genprokuratura-planiruet-privlech-k-ugolovnoj-otvetstvennosti-deputatov-shturmovavshih-sizo.html | title = Генпрокуратура планирует привлечь к уголовной ответственности депутатов, штурмовавших СИЗО | publisher = podrobnosti.ua | language = ru | date = 27 July 2003 | accessdate = 2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://korrespondent.net/ukraine/politics/73958-genprokuratura-hochet-privlech-k-otvetstvennosti-treh-deputatov-verhovnoj-rady-obnovleno | title = Генпрокуратура хочет привлечь к ответственности трех депутатов Верховной Рады (обновлено) | publisher = Korrespondent.net | language = ru | date = 27 July 2003 | accessdate = 2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.pravda.com.ua/rus/news/2003/06/27/4373311/ | title = Турчинов, Хмара, Рудьковский — криминальные хулиганы? | publisher = ''[[Ukrayinska Pravda]]'' | language = ru | date = 27 July 2003 | accessdate = 2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 13, 2003, tax officials detained at the office of the "Fatherland" party Ruslan Lukyanchuk, one of the assistants of Oleksandr Turchynov. He was charged with involvement in [[Foreign exchange fraud|illegal currency exchange]]. The [[Prosecutor General of Ukraine]] Svyatoslav Piskun then stated that the detention of Turchynov's assistant was part of a planned process of initiating a criminal case.

In February 2006 state prosecutors opened a criminal case against Turchynov and his SBU deputy Andriy Kozhemyakin for destroying a file about [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitive]], organized crime boss [[Semyon Mogilevich]], from the SBU archive.

According to the ''[[Komsomolskaya Pravda in Ukraine]]'' newspaper referring to deputy mayor of [[Kiev]] [[Leonid Chernovetskyi]], Mr. Turchynov is related to unlawful construction in the Landscape Valley (''Peyzazhna aleya'') district of [[Kiev]]. In autumn of 2004 the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine]] signed an investment contract with JSC ''Ukrainian Property'' (OAO "Ukrayinsʹke mayno") on the construction of an apartment building in this district. With this the share of the MFA in the project made just 20%. The Ministry actually became a cover for the businessmen. As of the 1 January 2007, 91.1% of the JSC ''Ukrainian Property'' shares belonged to ''Eclad Invest Ltd.'' (USA), and 8.2% to Valery Kovalenko. Previously, the shares of JSC ''Ukrainian Property'' belonged to JSC ''Financial holding "L-Holding"'', the largest shareholder of which was JSC ''Centre of Financial Technologies''. Oleksandr Turchinov owned 26.2% of the shares of this company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://from-ua.com/news/131567-smi-turchinov-prichasten-k-nezakonnoi-zastroike-na-peizazhnoi-allee.html | title = СМИ: Турчинов причастен к незаконной застройке на Пейзажной аллее | publisher = from-ua.com | date = 7 May 2008 | accessdate = 19 March 2018 | language = ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.segodnya.ua/newsarchive/ctrojku-na-pejzazhnoj-allee-initsiiroval-turchinov---kilchitskaja.html | title = Стройку на Пейзажной аллее инициировал Турчинов – Кильчицкая | publisher = ''[[Segodnya]]'' | date = 17 April 2008 | accessdate = 19 March 2018 | language = ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 23, 2008, the Kiev District Administrative Court ruled that Oleksandr Turchinov had no personal relationship with the construction of the Landscape Valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.unian.net/politics/111971-sud-ustanovil-chto-turchinov-na-peyzajnoy-allee-nichego-ne-stroit.html | title = Суд установил, что Турчинов на Пейзажной аллее ничего не строит | publisher = [[Ukrainian Independent Information Agency|UNIAN]] | date = 23 April 2008 | accessdate = 19 March 2018 | language = ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, journalists of the ''Economichna Pravda'' (''[[Ukrayinska Pravda]]'' project) accused Oleksandr Turchinov of influencing the leadership of the [[State Special Communications Service of Ukraine]] (DSTSZI). Despite the introduction of the system of electronic declarations on the incomes of civil servants and officials, those declarations without a DSTSZI's security certificate could not have legal force in court cases.

In March 2017, former people's deputy [[Oleksandr Shepelev]] accused Turchinov and [[Ruslan Lukyanchuk]] of stealing and withdrawing $800 million from the state budget with the assistance of the [[International Monetary Fund]]. According to Shepelev, in 2009 Turchinov and Lukyanchuk "were taxed by the heads of ministries and state enterprises", and received money from them to the accounts of the ''European Bank for Rational Financing'' (EBRD). There, hryvnias were converted into the [[cash]] dollars, which then were withdrawn to [[Offshore financial centre|offshores]] through the Baltic banks and [[Shell corporation|shell companies]]. The largest of these companies was ''Fortex'', owned by Lukyanchuk and registered in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. Turchinov urged the [[National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine|NABU]] to investigate the charges against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://strana.ua/news/60435-turchinov-prizval-nabu-rassledovat-vydvinutye-protiv-nego-obvineniya-v-krazhe-800-millionov.html | title = Турчинов призвал НАБУ расследовать выдвинутые против него обвинения в краже $800 миллионов | publisher = Strana.ua | language = ru | date = 14 March 2017 | accessdate = 22 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://gordonua.com/news/politics/eks-nardep-shepelev-zayavil-chto-turchinov-i-lukyanchuk-vyveli-v-ofshory-800-mln-iz-gosbyudzheta-i-pomoshchi-mvf-177797.html | title = Экс-нардеп Шепелев заявил, что Турчинов и Лукьянчук вывели в офшоры $800 млн из госбюджета и помощи МВФ | publisher = Gordonua.com | language = ru | date = 10 March 2017 | accessdate = 22 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://rian.com.ua/politics/20170310/1022129452.html | title = Турчинова и Лукьянчука обвинили в выводе в оффшоры $800 млн | publisher = ''[[RIA Novosti]]'' | language = ru | date = 10 March 2017 | accessdate = 22 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Ukrainian lawyer living in Russia and disgraced former First Deputy [[Prosecutor General of Ukraine]] [[Renat Kuzmin]], the court ordered [[National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine]] to initiate the criminal proceedings against Turchynov for theft and withdrawal of $800 million to offshore companies. The NSDC press service said that Kuzmin's publication contains  false information that "Russian secret services are replicating in order to discredit the Secretary of the Turchinov Council." Turchynov later appealed to the State Financial Monitoring Service of Ukraine and the National Anti-Corruption Bureau with a request to conduct a check of the statements of the former members of the Yanukovych team hiding out in [[Russia]] that he withdrew $ 800 million from the state budget to the offshore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://strana.ua/news/72289-sud-razreshil-nabu-rassledovat-delo-ob-ofshorah-turchinova-kuzmin.html | title = Суд обязал НАБУ расследовать дело об офшорах Турчинова - Кузьмин | publisher = Strana.ua | language = ru | date = 23 May 2017 | accessdate = 23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://gordonua.com/news/politics/kuzmin-zayavil-chto-sud-obyazal-nabu-rassledovat-zloupotrebleniya-turchinova-v-snbo-oprovergayut-informaciyu-189827.html | title = Кузьмин заявил, что суд обязал НАБУ расследовать злоупотребления Турчинова, в СНБО опровергают информацию | publisher = Gordonua.com | language = ru | date = 23 May 2017 | accessdate = 23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://gordonua.com/news/politics/turchinov-poprosil-proverit-obvineniya-v-ego-adres-o-rashishchenii-gosbyudzheta-178346.html | title = Турчинов попросил проверить обвинения в свой адрес о расхищении госбюджета | publisher = Gordonua.com | language = ru | date = 14 March 2017 | accessdate = 13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restaurants==

Deen's home business, The Bag Lady, soon outgrew her kitchen. She first moved into the Best Western on Savannah's southside on Abercorn Street in 1991 with a restaurant called The Lady. In January 1996,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ladyandsons.com/index.php/family/beginnings/|title=The Lady and Sons Restaurant – Our Beginnings|accessdate=Apr 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deen opened her restaurant, The Lady &amp; Sons, in downtown Savannah, on West Congress Street. Within a few years, the restaurant moved to the old White Hardware building on Whitaker. ''[[USA Today]]'' named The Lady &amp; Sons the "International Meal of the Year" in 1999. The specialty is a [[buffet]] of Southern "[[comfort foods]]".&lt;ref&gt;

Every buffet meal includes a [[salad bar]] and one dessert. Her sons are also involved in managing the restaurant, which is popular with tourists visiting Savannah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cooking.savvy-cafe.com/rags-to-riches-paulas-home-cooking-recipes-2008-03-27/ |title=Savvy Cooking » Rags to Riches: Paula's Home Cooking Recipes |publisher=Cooking.savvy-cafe.com |date=March 27, 2008 |accessdate=March 28, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20090624021023/http://cooking.savvy-cafe.com/rags-to-riches-paulas-home-cooking-recipes-2008-03-27/ |archivedate=June 24, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Deen owned four casino buffets; they were at [[Harrah's Casino Tunica]] in Mississippi, [[Harrah's Cherokee]] casino in North Carolina, [[Horseshoe Southern Indiana]], and [[Harrah's Joliet]] in Illinois. They were rebranded in 2013 shortly after Deen was removed from the Food Network.&lt;ref name="casinos"/&gt;

In September 2009, Deen announced a new dessert line to be sold at [[Walmart]] including signature pies Apple Crunch Top, Dark Rum Pecan, Old Fashioned Fudge and [[St. Louis]] style [[Gooey Butter Cake]] bars.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120912013917/http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS236211+01-Sep-2009+PRN20090901 "Paula Deen Serves Up New Affordable, Quality Baked Goods Line For Walmart"] (Press release).

In November 2017, Deen announced that two new Paula Deen restaurants would open in Texas. One location in Dallas is set to open in Spring 2018 and the San Antonio location will open 6–8 weeks later.

==Books and magazines==
In 1997, Deen self-published ''The Lady &amp; Sons Savannah Country Cookbook'' and ''The Lady &amp; Sons, Too! A Whole New Batch of Recipes from Savannah ''. Both cookbooks featured traditional Southern recipes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodtimeline.org/foodpies.html#chess |title=FAQs: pie &amp; pastry |publisher=Food Timeline |accessdate=June 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has since published two more, written with Martha Nesbit. Deen has appeared on [[QVC]] and on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' (first in 2002, twice in 2007 and once in 2010). Her life story is featured in ''Extraordinary Comebacks: 201 Inspiring Stories of Courage, Triumph, and Success'' (2007, Sourcebooks). In April 2007, [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] published Deen's memoir, ''It Ain't All About the Cookin'''. She launched a lifestyle magazine called ''Cooking with Paula Deen'' in November 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-133895840.html |title=Paula Deen Magazine to Debut |publisher=Business Wire |date= |accessdate=June 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which claimed a circulation of 7.5 million in March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cookingwithpauladeen.com/download/media_kit/media_kit09.pdf|title=Home – Paula Deen Magazine|work=Paula Deen Magazine|accessdate=July 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Paula Deen Ventures signed a distribution agreement with [[Hachette Book Group|Hachette]] Client Services for future cookbooks.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/book-deals/article/65748-paula-deen-inks-deal-with-hachette.html  Paula Deen Inks Deal with Hachette]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hachettebookgroup.biz/client-publishers/our-clients/ Hachette - Our Clients]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Food Network and other television==
Deen's relationship with [[Food Network]] began in 1999, when her friend Erin Lewis introduced her to [[Gordon Elliott]], who then introduced her to her then agent, Artist's Agency owner Barry Weiner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://njmg.typepad.com/foodblog/2007/04/33_minutes_with.html |title=33 Minutes With Paula Deen |publisher=Second Helpings |date=April 25, 2007 |accessdate=June 26, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120711132111/njmg.typepad.com/foodblog/2007/04/33_minutes_with.html |archivedate=July 11, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Elliott took her through the city for a series of ''[[Doorknock Dinners]]'' episodes. She also appeared on ''[[Ready, Set, Cook!]]''. Deen was invited to shoot a pilot named ''Afternoon Tea'' in early 2001. The network liked it, and eventually gave Deen her own show, ''[[Paula's Home Cooking]]'', which premiered in November 2002. ''Paula's Home Cooking'' was originally taped in [[Millbrook, New York]] at the home of [[Gordon Elliott]], the show's executive producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2004/09/08/Taste/Deen_of_the_kitchen.shtml |title=Taste: Deen of the kitchen |publisher=Sptimes.com |date= |accessdate=March 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Cowen, Diane |url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/travel/3731009.html |title=Meet Savannah's Biggest Star |work=Houston Chronicle |date=March 19, 2006 |accessdate=March 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deen mentioned on the March 13, 2006, edition of ''[[The Daily Buzz]]'' that the next batch of episodes of her show would be taped at her home in [[Savannah, Georgia]].

==Criticism==

===Unhealthy recipes===

You tell them to have [[chocolate cake]] and meatloaf for lunch. And french fries.

'''Roberto Goyeneche''' (January 29, 1926 in [[Saavedra, Buenos Aires|Saavedra]], [[Buenos Aires]] – August 27, 1994 in [[Buenos Aires]]) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[Tango music|tango]] singer of [[Basque people|Basque]] descent,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.euskosare.org/kultura/tango_vascos El tango y los vascos&lt;/ref&gt; who epitomized the archetype of 1950s Buenos Aires' [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] life, and became a living legend in the local music scene.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.todotango.com/English/creadores/rgoyeneche.html "Ricardo García Blaya about Roberto Goyeneche"]. Retrieved on Aug 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was known as ''El Polaco''&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://argentina.informatik.uni-muenchen.de/tangos/msg01843.html "Garganta Con Arena"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008073014/http://argentina.informatik.uni-muenchen.de/tangos/msg01843.html |date=2008-10-08 }}. Retrieved on Aug 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; ("the [[Poland|Pole]]") due to his blond hair, and thinness, like the Polish immigrants of the time. He is identified with the neighborhood of [[Saavedra, Buenos Aires|Saavedra]], where he grew up.

== Career ==
Roberto Goyeneche was formed in the style of the tango of [[Carlos Gardel]], later reached a more personal style. In 1944, at the age of 18, he joined Raúl Kaplún's [[orchestra]] after winning a local contest and soon gave his live debut performance on Radio Belgrano. In 1952 Goyeneche teamed up with [[Horacio Salgán]].

In 1956, he became the singer in the orchestra of his dear friend [[Aníbal Troilo]], with whom he recorded 26 songs. Later, Goyeneche became the first singer to record [[Ástor Piazzolla]]'s classic ''Balada Para Un Loco'', after starting his solo career in 1963.

During the 1980s, Goyeneche appeared as special guest in the movies ''[[El exilio de Gardel]]'' and ''[[Sur (film)|Sur]]'', both directed by [[Fernando Solanas]].
&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0333059/ "Roberto Goyeneche in The Internet Movie Database"]. Retrieved on Aug 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of his death on 27 August 1994 in Buenos Aires, he was considered the greatest tango singer active. As a  tribute, an avenue in the neighborhood of Saavedra, in Buenos Aires, is named after him.

== Early Life ==
Born in 1947 as the fourth of 10 children to a hawker in a coffee shop along Lavender Street,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lim|first1=Wen Jian|title=Remember The Date|publisher=The Straits Times|date=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tay began his working life as a coffee boy at his family's coffee shop. He helped the family's coffee shop business by serving coffee and tea to customers in Singapore Casket and learned about the funeral trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://xin.msn.com/en-sg/video/watch/life-story-ii-episode-8/vp-5abe7f5b-ef74-4c6d-9b13-aa71ed313c9c | title=Life Story 2 Episode 8 | publisher=XinMsn | accessdate=16 December 2014 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141226192711/http://xin.msn.com/en-sg/video/watch/life-story-ii-episode-8/vp-5abe7f5b-ef74-4c6d-9b13-aa71ed313c9c | archivedate=December 26, 2014 | deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

When his father died, Tay converted the coffee shop into Casket Palace, which was subsequently bought over by Singapore Casket.&lt;ref name='JanineOngVideo'&gt;{{cite web|title=Collecting the Pink Card: Roland Tay's Charitable Funeral Services|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXDc8DllPM0|last1=Ong|first1=Janine|accessdate=20 February 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180626052247/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXDc8DllPM0|archivedate=26 June 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In the subsequent years, Tay started a few funeral companies including Tong Aik Undertaker and Direct Funeral Services.  

Tong Aik Undertaker is in charge of operating the Singapore Police Force's police hearse and also operates as Direct Funeral Services&lt;ref name="TongAikUndertaker"&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=https://directfuneral.wordpress.com/about/|website=Tong Aik Undertaker 郑海船 96379909|accessdate=17 February 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312044727/https://directfuneral.wordpress.com/about/|archivedate=12 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; since 2000.

In 2004, Tay with Direct Funeral Services conducted the pro-bono funeral of [[Murder of Huang Na|Huang Na]], an eight-year-old girl who was murdered brutally in [[Pasir Panjang]], Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nadarajan|first1=Ben|title=Thousands Bid tearful farewell to Huang Na|agency=The Straits Times|publisher=Singapore Press Holdings|date=9 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by another pro-bono funeral in 2005 of 22-year-old Chinese national [[Liu Hong Mei]] who was murdered and chopped into seven parts before being dumped in the [[Kallang River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kallang body parts murder|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1793_2011-03-17.html|accessdate=27 December 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141227143223/http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1793_2011-03-17.html|archivedate=27 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of sewing the body parts back together took Roland Tay and his embalmers 7 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=T.|first1=Sua|title=Final Send Off|agency=NewspaperSG|publisher=Singapore Press Holdings|date=12 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also oversaw the funeral of [[Li Hong Yan]] a 24-year-old village girl from [[Heilongjiang]] who drowned at [[Sentosa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The naked body &amp; story behind Adrian Chua's Sentosa Cove pool in S'pore|url=http://www.whatsonxiamen.com/news13540.html|accessdate=17 February 2016|date=23 Jul 2010|ref=lihongyan|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160224192839/http://www.whatsonxiamen.com/news13540.html|archivedate=24 February 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tay reportedly collected around three hundred identity cards of deceased whom were without family and whom he conducted pro-bono funerals services.&lt;ref name='JanineOngVideo' /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yang|first1=JiaJun|title=100 Identity Cards, 100 Sad Stories|agency=Lian He Wanbao 联合晚报|publisher=Singapore Press Holdings|date=8 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Tay's more memorable cases is the pro-bono funeral he provided for the primate tourism icon [[Ah Meng]] of Singapore.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kong|first1=Simin|title=4000 people give Ah Meng a final farewell|agency=Xinmin Daily News 新明日报|publisher=Singapore Press Holdings|date=10 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Tay brought his daughter Jenny Tay into the business who subsequently helped him rebrand the undertaking firm&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wrist Taker|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/fashion/wrist-taker-1|accessdate=22 September 2017|work=The Straits Times|date=21 September 2017|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170922100531/http://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/fashion/wrist-taker-1|archivedate=22 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; after quitting her job at a marketing firm. 

==Personal life==
In 2013, Tay and his wife, Sally Ho, filed and finalized their divorce in June. According to the court papers, the cumulated properties were estimated to be a total of about $20 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tan|first1=Judith|title=Big money, big fight|url=http://news.asiaone.com/news/singapore/big-money-big-fight|accessdate=17 February 2016|publisher=The New Paper|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150103215617/http://news.asiaone.com/news/singapore/big-money-big-fight|archivedate=3 January 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Roronoa Zoro'''|ロロノア・ゾロ||spelled as "Roronoa Zolo" or "Roronoa Zollo" in some English adaptations}}, nicknamed {{nihongo|"Pirate Hunter" Zoro|海賊狩りのゾロ|Kaizoku-Gari no Zoro}}, is a  [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] in the ''[[One Piece]]'' franchise created by [[Eiichiro Oda]].

In the story, Zoro is the first to join [[Monkey D. Luffy]] after he is saved from being executed at the Marine Base.  He is one of the two swordsmen of the [[Straw Hat Pirates]], the other being Brook.  As a native to the East Blue, he came from the town known as Shimotsuki, where he trained in a dojo and learned the one and two-sword styles (ittōryū and nitōryū).  Zoro is uniquely known as an expert of Santōryū (Three Sword Style), where he wields a third sword with his mouth in combat.  Throughout the series, his primary sword is Wado Ichimonji, a sword that he inherited from a childhood friend, and is frequently the sword that he wields in his mouth.

== Appearances ==
Zoro first appears in the manga chapter {{nihongo|"Enter Pirate Hunter Zoro"|"海賊狩りのゾロ"登場|Kaizoku-gari no Zoro Tōjō}}, first published in Japan's ''[[Weekly Shōnen Jump]]'' magazine on August 18, 1997.&lt;ref name="firstsj"&gt;{{Cite comic |cartoonist =  [[Eiichiro Oda|Oda, Eiichiro]]|story = "海賊狩りのゾロ"登場|volume= 29|title = Weekly Shonen Jump|issue = 36|date = August 18, 1997 |publisher = [[Shueisha]]|location = Japan}}&lt;/ref&gt; He first appears as a captured criminal awaiting his execution at the hands of the Marines.&lt;ref name="firstsj" /&gt; Before the beginning of the series' narrative, Zoro loses his childhood friend Kuina and vows to get strong.&lt;ref name="ch5"&gt;
{{cite book

|series=One Piece

&lt;/ref&gt;

For years, he hunts pirates only to get money for food in the company of his friends [[Johnny and Yosaku]]. When Luffy offers Zoro to join his crew, he initially refuses. However, after Zoro is saved from being executed by Captain Morgan, he joins Luffy.  When he discovers that the best swordsman in the world is [[Dracule Mihawk]], Zoro thinks only to beat him one day.&lt;ref&gt;''[[One Piece]]'' manga, [[List of One Piece chapters (1-186)#vol6|Volume 6, Chapter 52]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, he is defeated at Mihawk's hands.

After fighting Daz Bonez in Alabasta, Zoro's bounty is initially set at [[File:Berrysymbol.gif]]60,000,000, but is later raised to [[File:Berrysymbol.gif]]120,000,000 after fighting the World Government at Enies Lobby. Later, the crew is separated by Bartholomew Kuma. Zoro encounters Mihawk again, and trains under him before reuniting two years later. He receives a bounty of [[File:Berrysymbol.gif]]320,000,000 after defeating Pica.

== Creation and conception ==

=== Design ===
Zoro commonly wears a plain white shirt (though he can be seen wearing other types of shirts), black pants, and a light-green, [[haramaki (armour)|haramaki]] sash that holds his three swords. Zoro also has a black [[Kerchief|bandanna]] tied around his left bicep that he only wears on his head while in a serious battle. Under his shirt, his torso is heavily scarred from many of the battles he has fought, especially since he joined the Straw Hats (like the one acquired during the battle against  Dracule Mihawk, one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea). He has three golden ear rings in his left ear which denotes his three swords style. Eventually, Zoro has a scar across his left eye (and appears to have lost that eye) and replaces his shirt with a long dark green samurai's coat which he can even open the torso part while fighting (against the New Fishman Pirates) or when he experiences heat (burning side of Punk Hazard).

=== Personality ===
Zoro is confident, but often acts in a very comical manner. A [[running gag]] is that he has a terrible sense of direction which he is very insecure about since he never admits it when he gets lost, instead always blaming someone else. While the crew is out at sea, Zoro can be found (usually) sleeping or training towards his goal of becoming the world's best swordsman. He and [[Sanji (One Piece)|Sanji]] have a great rivalry, often resorting to fighting (both verbally and physically) over issues from minor to extreme.

Though not a samurai, he appears to maintain a certain degree of bushido, and is frequently mistaken for one. Unlike Luffy and most of the other Straw Hat pirates, Zoro has been known to kill his opponents if he has to, though never in cold blood. It is shown that Zoro enjoys fighting a strong opponent (usually left to face down the second strongest villain in each arc, as Luffy faces down the strongest). When battling a worthy opponent Zoro tends to retain a maniacal grin and serious glare throughout.

Zoro has a stern, serious and distanced personality, but unlike Robin, he often reacts in a goofy and exaggerated comic style due to his short-tempered and impatient attitude. On the ship, he normally either trains with weights or sleeps. The only work he is seen doing regularly is hoisting the anchor using his great strength and maintaining look out in the ships crow's nest (which on the Thousand Sunny ship also doubles as his personal gym). He also likes sake, almost to the degree that Luffy likes meat, but like Nami, he never gets drunk due to his inhumanly-high endurance and tolerance for alcohol. Another notable trait is his lack of orientation, as Zoro often gets lost, even in small, familiar spaces or when being led by someone. Despite this, he is often the first to sense an enemy or danger, and the first to react. He is often displayed being well aware of dangerous situations and people around him.

Zoro often also reminds others of the harsh facts, which often shocks some of the other crew members, although they usually decide he is right. Zoro is an atheist, because he stated that he does not pray to any god, and has never believed in anything except himself. Even so, Zoro knows that he still has a lot of untapped potential, and is constantly seen training and trying to improve his fighting skills. He also adheres to a strict sword master's code of honor, and never falsely brags or lies about his abilities, sometimes outright admitting a weakness, even to an enemy. He also never tries to escape from a fight or use trickery to win, believing that doing so is cowardly and scorning anyone who uses such tactics. Zoro is very vigorous, strong-willed and determined.

=== Scars ===
Related to his fighting/manly spirit, Zoro has a lot of scars on his body. The most noticeable is the long scar running down his left eye which is the one he got after he came back from the 2 year time skip, which is currently unknown how he acquired it, all we know is that he can't open his left eye because of it. 
He also has a heavily scarred torso having a diagonal cut mark from top to bottom of his torso by Dracule Mihawk. He also has scars on both of his ankles which he obtained from trying to cut his own legs off in order to escape the candle prison of Mr. 3 in Little Garden.

=== Voice actors ===
In the original Japanese version of the ''[[One Piece]]'' anime series, Zoro is voiced by [[Kazuya Nakai]] as an adult and [[Megumi Urawa]] as a child.

In [[Odex]]'s dub of the first 104 episodes of ''One Piece'' in Singapore, Zoro was voiced by Brian Zimmerman. In [[4Kids Entertainment]]'s dub of the first five-story arcs of ''One Piece'', [[Marc Diraison]] voiced adult Zoro and [[Andrew Rannells]] voiced child Zoro. In [[Funimation Entertainment]]'s dub of the entire ''One Piece'' franchise, adult Zoro is voiced by [[Christopher Sabat]] with [[Cynthia Cranz]] playing the role of child Zoro for episode 2 and by [[Brina Palencia]] for the rest of the franchise.
In the game ''[[One Piece: Unlimited Adventure]]'', Sabat reprises his role as adult Zoro, with child Zoro voiced by [[Aaron Dismuke]].

== Reception==
Zoro ranked second in the first four ''Shōnen Jump'' character popularity polls, and ranked third in the fifth one, after Trafalgar Law.&lt;ref name="poll1"&gt;[[#vol.7|Volume 7]], page 148 (in the Japanese version).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="poll2"&gt;[[#vol.24|Volume 24]], pages 206–209 (in the Japanese version).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="poll3"&gt;[[#vol.43|Volume 43]], pages 214–219 (in the Japanese version).&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in a 2007 poll by [[Oricon]], Zoro was voted as the 4th most desired character to receive a spinoff.&lt;ref name="oricon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/news/confidence/40995/|title=スピンアウト企画、予想ランキング1位 『デスノート』のL（エル）|accessdate=November 9, 2008|language=Japanese|publisher=[[Oricon]]|date=January 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[DVD Talk]] praises Zoro's "hilarious" three-sword fighting style as a great example of the show's sense of humor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/33356/one-piece-season-1-first-voyage/|title=DVD Talk Review: One Piece – Season 1, First Voyage|accessdate=November 8, 2008|publisher=[[DVD Talk]]|date=May 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holly Ellingwood from Activeanime praised Zoro's fight against Luffy as one of the best moments from the 10th DVD from the series released by Viz Media, praising the action scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://activeanime.com/html/2007/08/15/one-piece-vol-10-baroque-works-advance-review|title=One Piece Vol. 10 Baroque Works (Advance Review)|author=Ellingwood, Holly|accessdate=July 5, 2009|publisher=Active Anime|date=August 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sabat's work with Zoro has resulted in him being a nominated of the category "Best Voice Actor (English)" in the Society for the Promotion of Japanese Animation (SPJA) Awards from 2008.&lt;ref name="spja"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2008-03-27/society-for-the-promotion-of-japanese-animation-announces-spja-industry-award-finalists-at-tokyo-international-anime-fair|title=Society for the Promotion of Japanese Animation Announces SPJA Industry Award Finalists at Tokyo International Anime Fair|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=March 27, 2008|accessdate=July 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carl Kimlinger of [[Anime News Network]] commented on Sabat's work with Zoro as a "standout", noting that Zoro and Sabat are "well-matched.&lt;ref name="season1"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/one-piece/dvd-season-1|title=Review: One Piece: DVD – Season 1 Part 1 Uncut|publisher=Anime News Network |date=June 3, 2008|author=Kimlinger, Carl|accessdate=December 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kimlinger also found that his and Sanji's flashbacks from the anime "really do jerk tears, even if they are less than gracefully executed".&lt;ref name="season2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/one-piece/dvd-season-one-part-2|title=Review: One Piece: DVD – Season One Part 2 Second Voyage|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=September 29, 2008|author=Kimlinger, Carl|accessdate=July 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sable Starr''' (nee '''Sabel Hay Shields'''; August 15, 1957 – April 18, 2009&lt;ref name="legacy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/rgj/obituary.aspx?n=sabel-shields&amp;pid=126559288|title=Sabel Shields's Obituary on Reno Gazette-Journal|publisher=|accessdate=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a noted American [[groupie]], often described as the "queen of the groupie scene" in [[Los Angeles]] during the early 1970s. She admitted during an interview published in the June 1973 edition of ''Star'' Magazine that she  was closely acquainted with [[Iggy Pop]], [[Mick Jagger]], [[Rod Stewart]], [[Alice Cooper]], [[David Bowie]], and [[Marc Bolan]].&lt;ref name="star61"&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Sunset Strip Groupies|magazine=Star Magazine|issue=5|publisher=Petersen Publishing|location=Los Angeles, California|date=June 1973|pages=59-61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life as a groupie==
Starr first attended concerts around Los Angeles with older friends who had dropped out of school in late 1968. She claims to have lost her virginity at age 12 with [[Spirit (band)|Spirit]] guitarist [[Randy California]] after a gig at [[Topanga, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|date=May 1973|title=Sable|magazine=Star Magazine|publisher=Petersen Publishing|location=Los Angeles, California|issue=4|pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had a younger sister, Corel Shields (born 1959), who according to Chris Charlesworth was involved with Iggy Pop in Autumn 1973,&lt;ref name="ambrose12"&gt;{{cite book|first=Joe|last=Ambrose|title=Gimme Danger: the Story of Iggy Pop|publisher=[[Omnibus Press]]|location=London, England|chapter=12|date=2002|ISBN=978-1847721167}}&lt;/ref&gt; when Corel was 13-14. Pop later immortalized his involvement with Starr herself in the 1996 song "Look Away." It refers to Sable being thirteen, which would be in 1970.
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;I slept with Sable when she was 13,
Her parents were too rich to do anything, &lt;br /&gt;
She rocked her way around L.A.,
'Til a [[New York Dolls|New York Doll]] carried her away…&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Starr became one of the first "baby groupies" who in the early 1970s frequented the [[Rainbow Bar and Grill]], the [[Whiskey A Go Go]], and [[Rodney Bingenheimer's English Disco]]; these were trendy nightclubs on West Hollywood's [[Sunset Strip]]. The girls were named as such because of their young age. She got started after a friend invited her to the Whiskey A Go Go at the age of 14.&lt;ref name="mcneil137"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Legs|last1=McNeil|first2=Gillian|last2=McCain|title=Please Kill Me: the Uncensored Oral History of Punk|publisher=Grove Press|location=New York City|date=1996|ISBN=978-0802125361|pages=137-139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starr later described herself at that period as having been "nuts to begin with. I always liked getting into trouble".&lt;ref name="mcneil137"/&gt; She had considered herself unattractive, so she had a [[nose job]] when she was 15.&lt;ref name="mcneil137"/&gt; During the time Starr was a groupie, she continued to live at home with her family and attended Palos Verdes High School to placate her parents.&lt;ref name="star61"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mcneil137"/&gt;

In 1973 she gave a candid interview for the short-lived Los Angeles-based ''Star Magazine'', and boasted to the journalist that she considered herself to be "the best" of all the local groupies.&lt;ref name="star61"/&gt; She also claimed that she was closely acquainted with some of rock music's leading musicians, such as [[Jeff Beck]], [[David Bowie]], [[Mick Jagger]], [[Rod Stewart]], [[Marc Bolan]], and [[Alice Cooper]]. She added that her favorite rock star acquaintance was [[Led Zeppelin]]'s lead singer, [[Robert Plant]].&lt;ref name="star61"/&gt; When asked how she attracted the attention of the musicians, she maintained it was because of the outrageous [[glam rock]] clothing she habitually wore.&lt;ref name="star61"/&gt; She was often photographed alongside well-known rock musicians; these photos appeared in American rock magazines such as ''[[Creem]]''  and ''Rock Scene''.

Starr admitted to having gotten into fights with rival groupies and she allegedly had a confrontation with [[Bianca Jagger]], who at the time was married to [[Rolling Stones]] frontman Mick Jagger. According to Starr, she knocked on Bianca's hotel room and when the latter opened the door she was told "in a few four-letter words to 'get lost'".&lt;ref name="star61"/&gt; [[Lori Mattix]], a fellow baby groupie, claimed that Starr once told her to "keep her hands" off of [[Jimmy Page]], saying "if you touch him, I will shoot you. He’s mine.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Lori|last=Maddix |authorlink=Lori Mattix|url=https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/i-lost-my-virginity-to-david-bowie |title=I Lost My Virginity to David Bowie |website=[[Thrillist]] |publisher=[[Group Nine Media]] |location=New York City|date=November 3, 2015|access-date=August 13, 2018 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her closest friends in Los Angeles were fellow groupies Shray Mecham and "Queenie".&lt;ref name="star61"/&gt; Model [[Bebe Buell]] described Starr as having been one of the two top Los Angeles groupies of the era, adding that "every rock star who came to Los Angeles wanted to meet her".&lt;ref name="mcneil137"/&gt;

She ran away from home when she was 16 after meeting [[Johnny Thunders]], guitarist in the glam rock band the [[New York Dolls]].&lt;ref name="mcneil151"&gt;McNeil, Legs, McCain, Gillian (1996). ''Please Kill Me: the Uncensored Oral History of Punk''. New York: Grove Press. p.150-151&lt;/ref&gt; She went to live with him in [[New York City]]. Their relationship didn't last, mainly due to his violent jealousy and [[drug addiction]].&lt;ref name="mcneil151-154"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Legs|last1=McNeil|first2=Gillian|last2=McCain|title=Please Kill Me: the Uncensored History of Punk|publisher=Grove Press|location=new York City|pages=151-154}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had wanted to marry her after she became pregnant with his child, but she refused and instead had an [[abortion]].&lt;ref name="mcneil151-154"/&gt; Tired of the physical abuse Thunders often inflicted upon her, and unable to adjust to the New York lifestyle, Starr moved back to Los Angeles. She claimed that "He [Thunders] tried to destroy my personality. After I was with him, I just wasn't Sable Starr anymore. He really destroyed the Sable Starr thing".&lt;ref name="mcneil151-154"/&gt; She made frequent visits to New York where she had an affair with [[Richard Hell]], befriended [[Nancy Spungen]], and participated in the local burgeoning [[punk rock]] scene. By the early 1980s, she was no longer part of the groupie milieu.&lt;ref name="mcneil151-154"/&gt;

==Later years and death==
She later moved to [[Reno, Nevada]].  She became a table game dealer at Carson Valley Inn in [[Minden, Nevada|Minden]] until shortly before her death.

Starr died at her home in Nevada on April 18, 2009 of [[brain cancer]] at the age of 51.&lt;ref name="legacy"/&gt; She was survived by her partner, Bill Reiner, her daughter, Allie Shields, and her son, Christian Sharpsteen. &lt;ref name="legacy"/&gt;

'''Salim M'Hamed Arrache''' (born 14 July 1982 in [[Marseille]], [[France]]) is an [[Algeria]]n [[Association football|footballer]]. He last played for [[Chengdu Tiancheng F.C.]] in [[China League One]].

==Early years==
Born to parents from [[Béjaïa]] (north-eastern Algeria), Arrache began to play for the local club of his neighborhood, the Batarelle, Northern Marseille in 1995.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

== Career ==
On July 20, 2009, the midfielder left [[Olympique de Marseille]] after both sides reached a mutual agreement to terminate his contract. He signed a 1-year contract with [[SC Bastia]] shortly after.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foot-national.com/flashes-9387.html Bastia : Salim Arrache (Marseille) a signé] {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On 4 December 2009, [[SC Bastia|Bastia]] announced they have reached a mutual agreement to end Arrache contract, only 4 months after his arrival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sc-bastia.net/v4/?p=2994 Communiqué du club] {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 6, 2011, Arrache signed a one-year contract with [[Kuwait]]i-side [[Qadsia SC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dzfoot.com/news-9290/transferts-salim-arrache-signe-a-al-qadisiya-koweit/|title=Transferts : Salim Arrache signe à Al-Qadisiya (Koweït)|work=DZfoot.com|access-date=2018-02-05|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on August 9, 2011, the club terminated his contract after he failed to impress the coach in pre-season friendlies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eurosport.anayou.com/football/kuwait-league/2010-2011/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%8A%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%BA%D9%86%D9%8A-%D8%B9%D9%86-%D8%B9%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B4_sto2901906/ar-story.shtml القادسية يستغني رسمياً عن الجزائري عراش]&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 25, 2012, he participated in a trial match for the [[Western Sydney Wanderers]]. This match was the first ever match the new club played, but Arrache was passed over and did not stay with the club after this match.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.westsydneyfootball.com/Match_Reports/_/season-2012-13/western-sydney-wanderers-vs-nepean-fc-25072012-730pm-r9|title=Western Sydney Wanderers vs Nepean FC 25/07/2012 7:30PM|website=West Sydney Football|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 2, 2013, he reportedly went for a trial to the Malaysian based club, [[Kelantan FA]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bolasepak-kelantan.com/tag/salim-arrache/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thered88colony.blogspot.com/2013/01/dickson-salim-tersenarai-dalam-skuad.html|title=The Red Colony: Dickson &amp; Salim tersenarai dalam skuad Kelantan merebut Piala Permai Hotlink 2013 : TSAM|last=Network|first=Tiger Crewz|date=2013-01-25|website=The Red Colony|access-date=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, after seven months back in France with [[AC Ajaccio]], Arrache's contract was terminated on a mutual agreement, allowing him to sign a new contract in China with [[Chengdu Tiancheng F.C.|Chengdu Tiancheng]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ac-ajaccio.com/Brevi/Salim_Arrache_a_resilie-04499|title=Salim Arrache a résilié|trans-title=Salim Arrache cancels his contract|publisher=[[AC Ajaccio|ac-ajaccio.com]]|language=French|date=22 February 2014|accessdate=23 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Samuel Wardwell''' (May 16, 1643 - September 22, 1692) was a man accused of [[witchcraft]] during the [[Salem witch trials]] of 1692. He was executed by [[hanging]] on September 22, 1692, along with [[Alice Parker (Salem)|Alice Parker]], [[Martha Corey]], [[Mary Eastey]], [[Ann Pudeator]], [[Mary Parker (Salem witch trials)|Mary Parker]], [[Wilmot Redd]], and [[Margaret Scott (Salem witch trials)|Margaret Scott]].

Wardwell was born on May 16, 1643, to Thomas Wardwell and Elizabeth Woodruff in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. His father had been a follower of [[John Wheelwright]] and [[Anne Hutchinson]].

Samuel's wife, Sarah, controlled a one hundred and eighty-eight-acre estate, which she had inherited from her first husband, Adam Hawkes, upon his death. The [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]] passed a law which provided attainder for "conjuration, witchcraft, and dealing with evil and wicked spirits", which meant the loss of civil, inheritance, and property rights of those accused.&lt;ref name=" Karlsen_105-106"&gt;Carol F Karlsen (1987) ''Devil in the Shape of a Woman'' New York: W.W. Norton and Co. pp. 105–06&lt;/ref&gt;

William Baker Jr., 14 years old, accused Samuel, Sarah, and their 19-year-old daughter Mercy Wardwell of [[witchcraft]]. All three confessed the very day they were interrogated.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Beth Norton (2002) ''In the Devil's Snare''. Alfred A. Knopf&lt;!-- ISBN; page(s) needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Samuel was executed at Proctor's Ledge in [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]] after retracting a [[Forced confession|"forced" confession]].&lt;ref name="stay"&gt;Elizabeth Wardwell Stay (1906) ''Wardwell, Sketch of the Antecedents of Solomon Wardwell ..'' E.A. Hall &amp; Co (via [https://archive.org/stream/wardwellbriefske00stay#page/n3/mode/2up Internet Archive])&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, his widow, Sarah Wardwell was reprieved and released. In 1712, after Sarah died, their son, Samuel Wardwell Jr., was left destitute and later sued the Colony and won some compensation for the family's ordeals.&lt;ref name="Karlsen_105-106"/&gt;

Per the TV show [[Who Do You Think You Are? (U.S. TV series)|Who Do You Think You Are?]], actor [[Scott Foley]] is a direct descendent of Samuel Wardwell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dna-explained.com/2016/04/09/scott-foley-who-do-you-think-you-are-god-knows-i-am-innocent/|title=Scott Foley – Who Do You Think You Are – “God Knows I Am Innocent”|date=April 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sylvia McAdam Saysewahum''' is a member of the Canadian Cree Nation. She is an advocate for First Nation and Environmental rights in Canada. She is a founding member of [[Idle No More]], a lawyer, a professor, and an author. In all of these cases, her work is focused on spreading awareness and education about First Nation and Environmental rights.

== Background ==
Sylvia McAdam was born and raised on [[Treaty 6]] territory, and is a direct descendent of those involved with creating the original treaty.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/being-idle-no-more-women-behind-movement|title=BEING IDLE NO MORE: THE WOMEN BEHIND THE MOVEMENT|last=Caven|first=Febna|date=|website=Cultural Survival|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She received her bachelors in human justice at the [[University of Regina]]. She is a single parent to six children.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After earning her bachelors she had a variety of jobs including: social worker, radio announcer, firefighter and a resource officer with the Saskatoon Police Service.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While working for the Saskatoon Police Service, Sayesewahum was inspired to continue to pursue law, and so she went to the [[University of Saskatchewan]] and earned her [[Juris Doctor]]ate.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.usask.ca/articles/people/2015/passionate-indigenous-voice.php|title=Passionate Indigenous Voice|last=Macpherson|first=Colleen|date=|website=University of Saskatchewan|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Name ===
McAdam chose to change her name. Rather than McAdam, which was a name given to her grandfather in school, she chose Saysewahum, which is her family's traditional surname&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Activism ==
Saysewahum has been involved in activism both through [[Idle No More]] and independently. Her work generally pertains to issues of First Nation and Environmental rights.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She was first inspired to take action after she returned to her father's land, and found that the creeks had dried up, and what were legally First Nation's traditional hunting grounds had been blocked off and were being logged. She reacted by nailing "no trespassing" signs all around the area, but that was not enough.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/sarah-van-gelder/idle-no-more-founders_b_2708644.html|title=Speaking With the Founders of Idle No More|last=van Gelder|first=Sarah|date=|website=Huffington Post|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after her experience with the hunting grounds, she read Bill C-45, and she realized the horrible implications it would have on the environment.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Because of her law background, she understood the aspect of [[acquiescence]] in law, which means that your silence can be interpreted as consent.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Saysewahum understood the ramifications of silence and idleness and how they undermine First Nation rights. She talked to [[Nina Wilson]] and [[Jessica Gordon]] about the consequences of the laws proposed by Bill C-45, and together, [[Idle No More]] was born.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== [[Idle No More]] ===

==== Bill C-45 ====
Bill C-45 was an omnibus budget implementation bill that removed the environmental protections from many of Canada's rivers and lakes. This legislation was passed without consultation with First Nation peoples who it predominately affected.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdn-hr-reporter.ca/content/carole-geller-award|title=THE CAROLE GELLER AWARD|last=|first=|date=|website=Canadian Human Rights Reporter|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Idle No More fought against this. Their movement started as a hashtag, #idlenomore, to spread awareness about the issue of the bill. From there the group's coverage grew and they staged several teach-ins culminating in a flash mob on the National Day of Action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/idle-no-more-where-is-the-movement-2-years-later-1.2862675|title=Idle No More: Where is the movement 2 years later?|last=Sinclair|first=Niigaan|date=|website=CBC News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This movement was a catalysis for Indigenous groups abroad in the United States, Australia and New Zealand to stand up for their rights and the land.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==== One House, Many Nations ====
Since Bill C-45 protests, Idle No More has been involved in an array of issues including the housing crisis. Saysewahum became really aware of the housing disparity when she ran for chief of reserve in Big River First Nation. Though she did not win the election, she was dedicated to do something about the housing. So together Idle No More started the indiegogo campaign "One House, Many Nations." Since Saysewahum has a legal education, she can speak to the original treaty terms that included rights to shelter. She drew on this legal understanding to call the colonial government out on what they needed to be providing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/idle-no-more-saskatoon-oct-11-1.3266568|title=Idle No More co-founder launches First Nations housing campaign|last=|first=|date=|website=CBC News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literary Works ==
Saysewahum is the author of two books, ''Nationhood Interrupted: Revitalizing Nêhiyaw Legal Systems'' and ''First Nations Protocols and Methodologies''. Both books are centered around the topic of Cree Law but with different purposes. Through both of these books Saysewahum develops the intricacies of First Nations. By elucidating these systems she spreads education and counters the assumption that First Nation communities are lawless.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Her books demonstrate her method of advocacy work where she connects her research and education with advocacy: expanding and explaining the First Nation legal systems that are so often ignored in Canadian politics.

=== First Nations Protocols and Methodologies. ===

Saysewahum's first book, ''First Nations and Methodologies'' was originally  published in 2009. When she wrote this book, it was the first time the elders had consented to having their oral laws and traditions written down.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In this book, she also provides a guide to appropriate traditional etiquette for individuals attending ceremonial activities of Indigenous peoples in Saskatchewan.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Nationhood Interrupted: Revitalizing Nêhiyaw Legal Systems ===

This book was published in 2015. Saysewahum decided to write it after she realized that there was a lack of knowledge about indigenous law. She felt that when she brought it up in conversation most people did not even understand what she meant by indegenous law. Saysewahum suggests that cree laws are not that different from the broader Canadian laws except that they were previously unwritten and not understood. So, with her book she was able to explain this cross over.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/1861051/book-sheds-light-on-unwritten-indigenous-laws/|title=Book sheds light on unwritten indigenous laws|last=Lett|first=Doug|date=|website=Global News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She believes the target audience for this book is everyone because it can create a template for Indigenous nations to revitalize their own laws, while also spreading education.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Biography==
Soldiers and officers in the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] army were taught by the Muslim martial arts instructor Wang Zi-Ping before he fought in the Boxer rebellion.&lt;ref&gt; http://m.zwbk.org/lemma/457905 http://www.china.com.cn/guoqing/2016-01/27/content_37676554_6.htm http://culture.163.com/06/0222/13/2AIPRMAB00281MU3.html http://m.qulishi.com/news/201507/34764_5.html http://www.wanhuajing.com/d293423&lt;/ref&gt; Early in his life, Wang fought in the [[Boxer Rebellion]] against the foreign Western and Japanese imperialist [[Eight-Nation Alliance]]. This was believed to be resulting from the fact that Ziping had lived most of his life with China under imperialist pressure from major European powers.
