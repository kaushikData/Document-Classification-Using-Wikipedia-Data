In [[Catholic canon law]], '''affinity''' is an [[Canonical impediment#Impediments to marriage|impediment to marriage]] of a couple due to the relationship which either party has as a result of a kinship relationship created by another [[Marriage in the Catholic Church|marriage]] or as a result of extramarital intercourse. The relationships that give rise to the impediment have varied over time. Marriages and [[sexual relation]]s between people in an affinity relationship are regarded as [[incest]]uous.

Today, the relevant principle within the [[Catholic Church]] is that "affinity does not beget affinity"—i.e., there is no affinity between one spouse's relatives and the other spouse's relatives. Canon 109 of the ''Code of Canon Law'' of the Catholic Church provides that affinity is an impediment to the marriage of a couple, and is a relationship which "arises from a valid marriage, even if not consummated, and exists between a man and the blood relatives of the woman and between the woman and the blood relatives of the man."&lt;ref&gt;''1983 Codex Juris Canonici'', New English Translation (Washington DC: Canon Law Society of America, 1999), Can. 109 §1&lt;/ref&gt; Also, affinity "is reckoned in such a way that the blood relations of the man are related by affinity to the woman in the same line and the same degree, and vice versa."&lt;ref&gt;''1983 Codex Juris Canonici'', New English Translation (Washington DC: Canon Law Society of America, 1999), Can. 109 §2&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Historical development==
===Mosaic law===
{{see also|Incest in the Bible|Christian views on the old covenant}}
In the [[Hebrew Bible]], {{bibleverse||Leviticus|18:8–18|NIV}} and {{bibleverse-nb||Leviticus|20:11–21|NIV}} contain prohibitions of sexual relations between a couple in a consanguineous relationship, as well as a number of prohibitions of certain affinity relationships, e.g.,  {{bibleverse||Leviticus|18:8|NIV}} (father’s wife), {{bibleverse-nb||Leviticus|18:14|NIV}} (father’s brother's wife), {{bibleverse-nb||Leviticus|18:16|NIV}} (brother’s wife), {{bibleverse-nb||Leviticus|18:18|NIV}} (wife’s sister), {{bibleverse-nb||Leviticus|20:11–12|NIV}} (father’s wife, daughter-in-law), {{bibleverse-nb||Leviticus|20:14|NIV}} (woman and her mother), {{bibleverse-nb||Leviticus|20:19|NIV}} (sister of either one's mother or father) and {{bibleverse-nb||Leviticus|20:21|NIV}} (brother’s wife). Marriage to a brother's widow is prohibited, but not to a deceased wife's sister.&lt;ref name="SRCL518"&gt;Patrick Colquhoun, ''A Summary of the Roman Civil Law, Illustrated by Commentaries on and Parallels from the Mosaic, Canon, Mohammedan, English, and Foreign Law'' (London: Wm. Benning &amp; Co., 1849), p. 518 &amp; ns. 10–13&lt;/ref&gt;  However, as an exception, {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|25:5–10|NIV}} requires a brother to marry his brother's widow if the brother died without issue, in a so-called [[Levirate marriage in Judaism|levirate marriage]].&lt;ref name="SRCL518"/&gt;

===Roman law===
[[Roman law|Roman civil law]] prohibited marriages within four degrees of consanguinity&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Colquhoun, ''A Summary of the Roman Civil Law, Illustrated by Commentaries on and Parallels from the Mosaic, Canon, Mohammedan, English, and Foreign Law'' (London: Wm. Benning &amp; Co., 1849), p. 513&lt;/ref&gt; but had no degrees of affinity with regards to marriage. However, the rule was that, if an issue of affinity arose, at whatever consanguineal level a couple was joined was considered the same level as regarded affinity.&lt;ref name="SRCL514"&gt;Patrick Colquhoun, ''A Summary of the Roman Civil Law, Illustrated by Commentaries on and Parallels from the Mosaic, Canon, Mohammedan, English, and Foreign Law'' (London: Wm. Benning &amp; Co., 1849), p. 514&lt;/ref&gt; Roman civil laws prohibited any marriage between parents and children, either in the ascending or descending line [[:wikt:ad infinitum|''ad infinitum'']].&lt;ref name="SRCL514"/&gt; Adoption was considered the same as affinity in that an adoptive father could not marry an [[:wikt:unemancipated|unemancipated]] daughter or granddaughter even if the adoption had been dissolved.&lt;ref name="SRCL514"/&gt; Slaves, as such, could not contract a legal marriage, but if freed were then subject to the general rules.&lt;ref name="SRCL510"&gt;Patrick Colquhoun, ''A Summary of the Roman Civil Law, Illustrated by Commentaries on and Parallels from the Mosaic, Canon, Mohammedan, English, and Foreign Law'' (London: Wm. Benning &amp; Co., 1849), p. 510&lt;/ref&gt; Also a marriage contracted within the prohibited degrees of consanguinity or affinity if contracted [[:wikt:bona fide|''bona fide'']], out of ignorance of any impediments, is allowed to stand and any children of this union were considered [[Legitimacy_(family_law)|legitimate]].&lt;ref name="SRCL510"/&gt;

===Historical Catholic canon law===
Regarding itself as not being bound by Old Testament commandments, the early Christian church followed Roman civil law, as the [[law of the land]].&lt;ref&gt;Brendan F. Brown, 'The Canon Law of Marriage', ''Virginia Law Review'', Vol. 26, No. 1 (Nov., 1939), p. 82 n. 54&lt;/ref&gt; The Christian emperors modified the rules from time to time and extended the civil law impediment to the first degree of collateral affinity. The church extended the impediment to relationships created by illicit intercourse. The [[Council of Elvira]] (c. 300), prohibited the marriage of a widower with his deceased wife's sister.&lt;ref name="ACL"&gt;R. Burtsell, 'Affinity (in Canon Law)', ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'' (New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907) [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01178a.htm also online at New Advent]&lt;/ref&gt; The prohibition became slowly more extensive. By the early 9th century the [[Catholic Church|Western Church]] had increased the number of prohibited degrees of consanguinity from four to seven.&lt;ref name=Bouchard&gt;Constance B. Bouchard, 'Consanguinity and Noble Marriages in the Tenth and Eleventh Centuries', ''Speculum'', Vol. 56, No. 2 (Apr., 1981), pp. 269–70&lt;/ref&gt; The method of calculating relationships was also changed to simply count the number of generations back to a common ancestor.&lt;ref name=Bouchard /&gt; The church also prohibited affinity to the same seven degrees.&lt;ref name="ACL"/&gt; While the impediment of affinity is close to but not as compelling as that of consanguinity, the reasoning behind the prohibited degrees of affinity being treated the same as that of consanguinity is the nearness to the blood relatives by the very act of sexual intercourse.&lt;ref name="ACL"/&gt;

Prior to the [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]] (1215), the Church recognized two additional forms of affinity.&lt;ref name="ACL"/&gt; Firstly, when a man married a widow, her relatives as well as those of her former husband were considered the man's relatives and treated as if they were his blood relatives.&lt;ref name="ACL"/&gt; Secondly, if the woman's first husband had been a widower then the blood relatives of his first wife became the woman's relatives and by her subsequent marriage, were also the new husband's relatives by affinity.&lt;ref name="ACL"/&gt; Also, a woman's children by a deceased husband, as well as the children of her husband by a deceased wife, were considered related by affinity.&lt;ref name="ACL"/&gt; So the subsequent marriages of step-siblings carried the same prohibitions as if they were related by blood. The principle established was "affinity begot affinity."&lt;ref name="ACL"/&gt; 

The Fourth Lateran Council removed the second type of affinity rule and the new axiom became: "affinity does not beget affinity", which is the principle followed in the modern Catholic church.&lt;ref name="ACL"/&gt; It also limited both affinity and consanguinity prohibitions to the fourth degree, but retained the same method of calculating, counting back to a common ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;''The History of Medieval Canon Law in the Classical Period, 1140–1234; From Gratian to the Decretals of Pope Gregory IX'', ed. Wilfried Harimann; Kenneth Pennington (The Catholic University of America Press, 2008), p. 350&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Council of Trent]] (1545-1563) limited the impediment to marriage on account of affinity in cases when the affinity is created out of marriage (e.g., by force or extra-matrimonial intercourse) to the second degree of affinity.

===Dispensation===
As the affinity rules have their origin in ecclesiastical and not divine law, impediments can be dispensed by the competent Church authority. The Pope or a bishop may grant a [[Matrimonial dispensation|dispensation to a marriage]] when the affinity rules would be breached.&lt;ref name="ACL"/&gt;

==Contemporary Christian positions==
The present Catholic church position is that affinity is covered by ecclesiastical law and bishops are permitted to [[:wikt:dispense|dispense]] any impediments, short of any order of priesthood or affinity in the direct line, if it stems from lawful sexual relationships.&lt;ref name="ACL"/&gt; The modern laws of the Anglican Church regarding affinity are found in the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'', which were revised from time to time. The [[Deceased Wife's Sister's Marriage Act 1907]] removed the impediment to marrying a late wife's sister. Restrictions were also relaxed by the ''[[Marriage Act 1949]]'' §1 and the ''Marriage (Prohibited Degrees of Relationship) Act 1986'', §1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] relationship prohibitions because of affinity follow {{bibleverse||Leviticus|18:8|NIV}} (father’s wife), {{bibleverse-nb||Leviticus|18:14|NIV}} (father’s brother's wife), {{bibleverse-nb||Leviticus|18:16|NIV}} (brother’s wife), {{bibleverse-nb||Leviticus|18:18|NIV}} (wife’s sister), {{bibleverse-nb||Leviticus|20:11–12|NIV}} (father’s wife, daughter-in-law), {{bibleverse-nb||Leviticus|20:14|NIV}} (woman and her mother), {{bibleverse-nb||Leviticus|20:19|NIV}} (sister of either one's mother or father) and {{bibleverse-nb||Leviticus|20:21|NIV}} (brother’s wife). However, the Greek patriarchs and bishops may grant dispensations with a certain degree of freedom or choose to adhere to the letter of the law.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Benz, ''The Eastern Orthodox Church: Its Thought and Life'' (Piscataway, N.J.: AldineTransaction, 2009), p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nestorian Church]] has few restrictions on affinity begetting affinity.&lt;ref name="ACL"/&gt; The [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] restricts affinity to the fourth degree, while the policy of [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] in general is very close to that of the [[Roman Catholic]] canons.&lt;ref name="ACL"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Pilgrim was born on September 11, 1924&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agnesbakerpilgrim.org/NewsDetails.asp?NewsID=39 Agnes Baker Pilgrim&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090406124809/http://www.agnesbakerpilgrim.org/NewsDetails.asp?NewsID=39 |date=April 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; having been delivered by Elizabeth Juliana Tole Harney, Pilgrim' grandmother who was a [[midwife]].&lt;ref&gt;Baker-Pilgrim A. Biography&lt;/ref&gt; Her family was poor during the [[Great Depression in the United States|Depression]] and survived with no electricity.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Native Village Publications&lt;/ref&gt;

Grandma Aggie, as she is affectionately known, has had a rich and varied working life ranging from working for the [[Indian Health Service]] as a physician's assistant, an [[Intervention (counseling)|alcohol and drug counselor]], a [[Scrubs (occupation)|scrub nurse]], a [[Lumberjack|logger]], a [[singer]], a [[Bouncer (doorman)|bouncer]], a [[barber]] in a [[jail]]  and a [[Racing driver#Stock car racing|stock car racing driver]].&lt;ref&gt;Penn State&lt;/ref&gt;

Thrice married, Pilgrim had three daughters and three sons. Pilgrim also has eighteen [[grandchildren]], twenty seven [[Grandparent#Great-grandparents|great grandchildren]] and a [[Grandparent#Great-grandparents|great great grandchild]].&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer (2006) p.18&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982 Pilgrim was seriously ill with [[cancer]]. Pilgrim claims that she asked the [[Great Spirit|Creator]] to let her live as she had lots of friends and family who relied on her, and that, she had a lot left to do in the world. Ever since that time she has had a transformation and gravitated to a very spiritual type of life - even though Pilgrim admits to have initially being reluctant to travel her spiritual path as she doubted her worthiness for this task.&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer (2006) p.17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sacred Salmon Ceremony==
A ceremony to welcome, [[Blessing|bless]], and thank the returning [[salmon]] each year was held by the [[Takelma]] tribe, as well as many other Indian tribes in the northwest United States and Canada, .&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; However, for 140 years, due to the loss of traditional ways, the ceremony was not performed publicly by the Takelma tribe.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; To revive the ceremony, Pilgrim and her late husband Grant Pilgrim (Yurok tribe), visited with area tribes that continued to perform this ceremony. Following numerous visits to ceremonial and spiritual gatherings of northwest tribes, the Pilgrims brought back their version of the [[ceremony]] to Southern Oregon.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Baker-Pilgrim, A, Salmon Ceremony '94-'06&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Holden2009&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holden|first=Madronna|title=Re-storying the World: Reviving the Language of Life|journal=Australian Humanities Review|date=November 2009|issue=47|url=http://www.australianhumanitiesreview.org/archive/Issue-November-2009/holden.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to Pilgrim's contribution in returning the Salmon Ceremony to [[Jackson County, Oregon|Jackson County]], she is known to some locals as the 'Keeper of the Sacred Salmon Ceremony'.&lt;ref name = "evergreen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Doty, T, Ceremonies&lt;/ref&gt;

A great deal of interest has since been shown by the [[National Geographic magazine]] and the [[World Wildlife Fund]] and [[Martha Stewart]] due to the unprecedented increase in salmon seen in the river since the ceremony has been performed.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Supriano, S, (2009-04-06)&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

The ceremony is annually held on the bank of the [[Applegate River]] in Southwest [[Oregon]]&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

==Konanway Nika Tillicum (All My Relations) Youth Academy==
While studying psychology and Native American studies at Southern Oregon University at the age of 50, Pilgrim co-founded the Konanway Nika Tillicum (All My Relations) Native American Summer Youth Academy.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; She is the Elder-Woman-in-Residence for the Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==The International Council of 13 Grandmothers==
{{Main|International Council of 13 Grandmothers}}
In 2004, Pilgrim was approached by The Center for Sacred Studies to serve on the [[International Council of 13 Indigenous Grandmothers]].  Pilgrim is the oldest of the Grandmothers and was [[election|elected]] as the council's [[Chairperson]].&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer (2006) p.19&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council has been active in protecting indigenous rights and medicines, promoting ancient wisdom.

Pilgrim considers the [[International Council of 13 Grandmothers]] not to have come together by accident, coming at the eleventh hour to be "a voice for the voiceless."&lt;ref&gt;Harcourt-Smith&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, she traveled with the group on "a trip to Rome to try to get Pope Benedict XVI to rescind historical papal bulls, which played a role in the genocidal onslaught of indigenous people worldwide," according to [[Indian Country Today Media Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1340">'''Ahöla''', also known as '''Ahul''',  is a spirit being, a [[kachina]], embodied by a man, in [[Hopi religion]].

Ahöla is one of the important chief katsinam for [[First Mesa, Arizona|First and Second Mesas]], in [[Hopi]], because he opens the mid-winter Powamu ceremony, sometimes called the bean planting festival. On the first night of the festival, he performs inside a [[kiva]], the subterranean, ceremonial space, before going with the Powamu Chief to give prayer feathers to Kachina Spring at dawn. Afterwards, Ahöla and the Powamu Chief visit all of the kivas and ceremonial houses, giving out bean and corn plants and marking the doorways with stripes of cornmeal. At the end of the ceremony, Ahöla descends to a shrine, bows four times to the Sun, and asks for health, happiness, long life, and good crops. Ahöla is also the friend of Eototo, and one legend tells of 
Ahöla having his throat cut to let Eototo to escape.

'''Akan religion''' comprises the traditional beliefs and religious practices of the [[Akan people]] of [[Ghana]] and eastern [[Ivory Coast]].  Akan religion is referred to as '''Akom''' (from the [[Twi]] word ''okom'', meaning "prophecy").  Although most [[Akan people]] have identified as [[Christianity|Christians]] since the early 20th century, Akan religion remains practiced by some, and is often [[religious syncretism|syncretized]] with Christianity.  The Akan have many subgroups (including the [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]], the [[Akuapem people|Akuapem]], the [[Wassa]], the [[Abron tribe|Abron]], the [[Anyi people|Anyi]], and the [[Baoulé people|Baoulé]], among others), so the religion varies greatly by region and subgroup.

Similar to other [[traditional African religions|traditional religions]] of [[West Africa|West]] and [[Central Africa]] such as [[West African Vodun]], [[Yoruba religion]], or [[Odinani]], Akan cosmology consists of a senior god who generally does not interact with humans and many gods who assist humans.

[[Anansi]] the Spider is a folk [[hero]], who is prominent in Ashanti folktales, where he is depicted as a [[trickster]].

==Deities==

===Creator God===
Followers of Akan religion believe in a supreme god who created the universe.  He is distant and does not interact with humans.

The creator god takes on different names depending upon the region of worship, including ''Nyame'', ''Nyankopon'', ''Brekyirihunuade'' ("Almighty"), ''Odomankoma'' ("infinite inventor"),{{sfn|Sykes |Kendall |2001 |p = 146}} ''Ɔbɔadeɛ'' ("creator") and ''Anansi Kokuroku'' ("the great designer" or "the great spider").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cfiks.org/akanart/akanart/themes/akancosmology.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=1 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140518025254/http://www.cfiks.org/akanart/akanart/themes/akancosmology.htm |archive-date=18 May 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is occasionally said that the creator god is a part of a triune deity or triad, which consists of Nyame, Nyankopon and Odomankoma.{{Sfn|Lynch|2010|p=93}}

The Supreme Creator is an [[omniscience|omniscient]], [[omnipotence|omnipotent]] [[sky father]].  His wife is [[Asase Ya]]a (also known as Mother Earth), considered second to God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ax0FxTUykP4C&amp;pg=PA148&amp;dq=akan+religion&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjO5Ybx4dPPAhWEPz4KHc3CCIsQ6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=asase&amp;f=false|title=The Quest for Spiritual Transformation: Introduction to Traditional Akan Religion, Rituals and Practices|last=Opokuwaa|first=Nana Akua Kyerewaa|date=2005-01-01|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=9780595350711|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together they brought forth two children: Bia and Tano.{{Sfn|Lynch|2010|p=94}}

===Abosom===
The ''abosom'', the lower deities or [[spirits]], assist humans on earth. These are akin to [[orisha]]s in [[Yoruba religion]], the vodun in [[West African Vodun]] and its derivatives, and the [[alusi]] in [[Odinani]].  Abosom receive their power from the creator god and are most often connected to the world as it appears in its natural state. Priests serve individual abosom and act as mediators between the abosom and mankind. Many of those who believe in these traditions participate in daily prayer, which includes the pouring of [[libation]]s as an offering to both the ancestors who are buried under the land and to the spirits who are everywhere.

===Nsamanfo===
The ''Nsamanfo '' are the [[ancestor worship|ancestors]]. They are sometimes referred to as ghost.

==In the Americas==

===Jamaica===

According to Long, Akan (then referred to as "[[Coromantee]]") culture obliterated any other African customs and incoming non-Akan Africans had to submit to the culture of the majority Akan population in [[Jamaica]], much like a foreigner learning migrating to a foreign country. Other than Ananse stories, Akan religion made a huge impact. The Akan pantheon of gods referred to as Abosom in [[Twi]] were documented. Enslaved Akan would praise Nyankopong (erroneously written by the British as Accompong, not related to the [[Maroon (people)|Maroon]] leader [[Accompong]] [Twi: ''Akyeampong'']); libations would be poured to [[Asase Ya]]a (erroneously written as 'Assarci') and Epo the sea god. Bonsam was referred to as the god of evil.&lt;ref name=Long&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QLw_AAAAcAAJ&amp;dq=edward%20long%20coromantee&amp;pg=PA446#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |format=google |first=Edward |last=Long |title=The History of Jamaica Or, A General Survey of the Antient and Modern State of that Island: With Reflexions on Its Situation, Settlements, Inhabitants, Climate, Products, Commerce, Laws, and Government |volume=2 |year=1774 |number= 3/4 |pages= 445–475}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Kumfu''' (from the word ''Akom'' the name of the Akan spiritual system) was documented as ''Myal'' and originally only found in books, while the term Kumfu is still used by Jamaican Maroons. The priest of Kumfu was called a ''Kumfu-man''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of Jamaica, From Its Discovery To The Year 1872|first= William James |last=Gardner |publisher=Appleton &amp; Company |page=184 |year=1909 |isbn=978-0415760997|url=https://www.amazon.com/History-Jamaica-Discovery-Christopher-Columbus/dp/0415760992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Jamaican Maroon spirit-possession language]], a [[Creole language|creolized]] form of [[Akan language|Akan]], is used in religious ceremonies of some [[Jamaican Maroons]].

====Myal and Revival====

Kumfu evolved into Revival, a syncretic Christian sect. Kumfu followers gravitated to the American [[Revival of 1800|Revival of 1800 Seventh Day Adventist movement]] because it observed Saturday as god's day of rest. This was a shared aboriginal belief of the Akan people as this too was the day that the Akan god, Nyame rested after creating the earth. Jamaicans that were aware of their Ashanti past while wanting to keep hidden, mixed their Kumfu spirituality with the American Adventists to create Jamaican Revival in 1860. Revival has two sects: ''60 order''(or Zion Revival, the order of the heavens) and ''61 order''(or Pocomania, the order of the earth). 60 order worships God and spirits of air or the heavens on a Saturday and considers itself to be the more 'clean' sect. 61 order more deals with spirits of the earth. This division of Kumfu clearly shows the dichotomy of Nyame and Asase Yaa's relationship, Nyame representing ''air'' and has his 60 order'; ''Asase Yaa'' having her 61 order of the ''earth''. Also the Ashanti funerary/war colours: red and black have the same meaning in Revival of ''vengeance''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jamaican Folk Medicine: A Source Of Healing|first=Mervyn C. |last=Allenye |publisher=University of the West Indies Press|pages=36 |year=2004 |isbn=9789766401238}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Ashanti elements include the use of swords and rings as means to guard the spirit from spiritual attack. The Asantehene like the Mother Woman of Revival, has special two swords used to protect himself from witchcraft called an [[Akrafena]] or ''soul sword'' and a Bosomfena or ''spirit sword'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Running to Mother-Thugs Seek Guard Rings and Divine Protection |publisher=''Jamaica Gleaner'' |date=September 19, 2010 |url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20100919/lead/lead4.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/online_research_catalogues/ag/asante_gold_regalia/i_history-significance-usage/iv.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suriname===
[[Winti]] is an [[Suriname|Afro-Surinamese]] religion which is largely derived from both Akom and [[Dahomean religion|Vodun]] with Vodun gods such as Loco, Ayizu and so on. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nieuwe West-Indische gids|author=Rijksuniversiteit te Utrecht Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies|publisher=Nijhoff|year=1979|volume=53&amp;ndash;55|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It documents several rock-cut benches ([[mastabas]]) in the village, numerous historical monuments in the nearby hills and an ancient fortified structure in the nearby [[Wadi Al-Toun]] of unknown date.&lt;ref name="MOTBaalbek"/&gt;

==Ain Choaab==
'''Ain Choaab''' or '''Ain Chaub''' spring is located in the nearby hills, just of the main road from Arsal to Labweh. There are [[Natufian]] rock shelters situated {{convert|80|m|ft}} above the [[wadi]] bed of the spring that can be accessed via a steep climb up a ridge. [[Flint]] tools were collected from the site by [[Bruce Schroeder]] in 1970.&lt;ref name="AkkermansSchwartz2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter M. M. G. Akkermans|author2=Glenn M.

==Syrian Civil War==
On 17 September 2012, [[Syria]]n [[ground-attack aircraft]] fired three missiles {{convert|500|m|ft}} over the border into Lebanese territory near Arsal. It was suggested that the jets were chasing rebels in the vicinity. The attack prompted Lebanese [[president]] [[Michel Sleiman]] to launch an investigation, whilst not publicly blaming Syria for the incident.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/09/18/syrian-jets-hit-lebanese-territory-near-border/#ixzz27JvfB9lg FOX News, Syrian jets hit Lebanese territory near border, September 18, 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 September 2012, a group of armed members of the [[Free Syrian Army]] attacked a border post near Arsal. This was reported to be the second incursion within a week. The group were chased off into the hills by the [[Lebanese Army]], who detained and later released some rebels due to pressure from locals. Michel Sleiman praised the actions taken by the military as maintaining Lebanon's position being “neutral from the conflicts of others". He called on border residents to “stand beside their army and assist its members.” [[Syria]] has repeatedly called for an intensified crackdown on rebels that it claims are hiding in Lebanese border towns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Politics/2012/Sep-23/188927-lebanese-president-praises-army-response-to-fsa-attack.ashx#ixzz27JxWSuyo The Daily Star (Lebanon), Lebanese president praises Army response to FSA attack, September 23, 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2012/09/22/rebeldes-sirios-atacan-un-puesto-del-ejercito-en-territorio-de-libano/ Rebeldes sirios atacan un puesto del Ejército en territorio de Líbano, CNN Espanol, Alkhshali Hamdi, Amir Ahmed, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Ben Brumfield and Joe Sterling, 22 September 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt;

One thousand four hundred refugee children from the [[Syrian civil war]] have been displaced into the town, where schools only have places for one hundred students. The situation reflects a growing crisis threatening to overwhelm the [[Beqaa Governorate|Beqaa]] educational system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Local-News/2012/Sep-19/188481-refugee-children-overwhelm-bekaa-schools.ashx#axzz27Jwe5enz al-Fakih, Rakan., The Daily Star (Lebanon), Refugee children overwhelm Bekaa schools, September 19, 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 February 2013, the Lebanese army was the victim of an armed ambush in the town as it was seeking to arrest Khaled Homayed. Two army officers were killed and a number of soldiers were wounded. Homayed is believed to have been involved with the [[Fatah al-Islam]] organization that was responsible for many deadly attacks on the Lebanese army as well as the [[2011 Estonian cyclists abduction|kidnapping of seven Estonians in 2011]]. He is also believed to be active with the Free Syrian Army. Town residents refused to cooperate with the army to reveal the whereabouts of the gunmen who were responsible for the ambush.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Local-News/2013/Feb-01/204650-army-patrol-ambushed-in-east-lebanon-several-casua.ashx#axzz2JflCcR28&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, ISIS and its allies [[Battle of Arsal|launched a full-scale invasion and the battle]] with Lebanese troops went on for five days before they were forced back into Syria.

In January 2016 a local newspaper reported that there were 10,000 Syrian refugees in Arsal itself with a further 100,000 in dozens of camps around the town.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Daily Star (Lebanon)]]. 4/1/16 p.3. Nidal Soth.&lt;/ref&gt; A second report estimated that Arsal was host to 50,000 refugees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Lebanon-News/2016/Jan-31/334854-mp-denies-residents-fleeing-border-town-due-to-isis-nusra-fighting.ashx] Daily Star 31/1/16&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 July 2017, a Syrian Army commander stated that his forces and [[Hezbollah]] had launched a joint campaign to recapture the remaining territory under militant control near the [[Lebanon-Syria border]], attacking the outskirts of Arsal. The Lebanese Army meanwhile assumed a defensive position in Arsal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-lebanon-idUSKBN1A608S|title=Hezbollah, Syria army launch offensive at Syrian-Lebanese border|date=21 July 2017|first1=Laila|last1=Bassam|first2=Tom|last2=Perry|accessdate=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Baku Ateshgah''' (from {{lang-fa|آتشگاه}}, ''Atashgāh'', {{lang-az|Atəşgah}}), often called the "Fire Temple of Baku" is a castle-like religious temple in [[Suraxanı (town)|Surakhani town]] (in [[Suraxanı raion]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ateshgahs and Zoroastrians in Azerbaijan: Good thoughts, good words, good deeds|url=http://thebriefnote.com/2012/04/06/ateshgahs-and-zoroastrians-good-thoughts-good-words-good-deeds-baku-atesgah-azerbaijan/|accessdate=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a suburb in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]].

Based on Persian and Indian inscriptions, the temple was used as a [[Hindu]], [[Sikh]], and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] place of worship. "Atash" (آتش) is the Persian word for fire.&lt;ref name="iranicaonline.org"&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/atas-fire ''ĀTAŠ'', M. Boyce, '''Encyclopædia Iranica''']&lt;/ref&gt; The pentagonal complex, which has a courtyard surrounded by cells for monks and a tetrapillar-altar in the middle, was built during the 17th and 18th centuries. It was abandoned in the late 19th century, probably due to the dwindling of the Indian population in the area. The natural [[eternal flame]] went out in 1969, after nearly a century of exploitation of petroleum and gas in the area, but is now lit by gas piped from the nearby city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fire Temple of Baku (Atlas Obscura)|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fire-temple-of-baku/| }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Baku Ateshgah was a pilgrimage and philosophical centre of Zoroastrians from Northwestern Indian Subcontinent, who were involved in trade with the Caspian area via the famous "[[Grand Trunk Road]]". The four holy elements of their belief were: ateshi (fire), badi (air), abi (water), and heki (earth). The temple ceased to be a place of worship after 1883 with the installation of petroleum plants (industry) at Surakhany. The complex was turned into a museum in 1975. The annual number of visitors to the museum is 15,000.

The Temple of Fire "Ateshgah" was nominated for [[List of World Heritage Sites|List of]] [[World Heritage Sites]],  [[UNESCO]] in 1998 by [[Gulnara Mehmandarova]].&lt;ref name="unesco"&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1172/ Surakhany, Atashgyakh (Fire - worshippers, temple - museum at Surakhany)]&lt;/ref&gt; On December 19, 2007, it was declared a state historical-architectural reserve by decree of the [[President of Azerbaijan]].&lt;ref name="prezreco2007"&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.anl.az/down/medeniyyet2007/dekabr/medeniyyet2007_dekabr_367.htm Распоряжение Президента Азербайджанской Республики «Об объявлении территории Храма Атешгях в Сураханском районе города Баку Азербайджанской Республики Государственным историко-архитектурным заповедником „Храм Атешгях“»]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The Persian [[toponym]] Atashgah (with [[Russian language|Russian]]/[[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]] pronunciation: ''Atashgyakh''/''Ateshgah'') literally means "home of fire." The Persian-origin term ''atesh'' (آتش) means ''fire'', and is a loanword in [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]]. ''Gah'' (گاہ) derives from Middle Persian and means "throne" or "bed". The name refers to the fact that the site is situated atop a now-exhausted [[natural gas field]], which once caused natural fires to spontaneously burn there as the gas emerged from seven natural surface vents. Today, the fires in the complex are fed by gas piped in from Baku, and are only turned on for the benefit of visitors.

''Surakhani'', the name of the town where the Ateshgah is located, likely means "a region of holes" (سراخ/''suraakh'' is Persian for ''hole''), but might perhaps be a reference to the fire glow as well (سرخ/''sorkh''/''surkh'' is Persian for ''red''). A historic alternative name for Azerbaijan as a whole has been ''Odlar Yurdu'', Azeri for ''land of fires''.&lt;ref name="lorie2006"&gt;{{Citation | title=The Traveler's Handbook: The Insider's Guide to World Travel |author1=Jonathan Lorie |author2=Amy Sohanpaul |author3=James Innes Williams | year=2006 | publisher=Globe Pequot | isbn=0-7627-4090-6 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=39JCQUe2T5kC | quote=''... Flames spontaneously erupt from the ground - hence the country's other name, Odlar Yourdu, or Land of Fires ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“Surakhany” in [[Tat language (Caucasus)|Tati]] (language of [[Suraxanı raion|Surakhany]], close to [[Persian language|Persian]]) means “hole with the fountain”.

Surakhani is located on the [[Absheron peninsula]], which is famous for being a locality where oil oozes naturally from the ground and flames burn perpetually - as at [[Yanar Dag]] - fed by natural hydrocarbon vapours issuing from the rock.&lt;ref name="cavendish2007"&gt;{{Citation | title=Peoples of Western Asia | author=Marshall Cavendish | year=2007 | publisher=Marshall Cavendish Corporation | isbn=0-7614-7677-6 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FZ2_aYHMl4IC | quote=''...

In the 7th century Armenian geography ''[[Ashkharatsuyts]]'', attributed to [[Anania Shirakatsi]], a location called “Yotnporakyan Bagink” (“Place with seven worshiped holes”) is mentioned in the [[Paytakaran]] province, which is thought to be the Ateshgah.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vehi.net/istoriya/armenia/geographiya/index.html «Армянская География VII века по Р.Х (приписывавшаяся Моисею Хоренскому)»] / Перевод и подготовка издания К. П. Патканова. — СПб., 1877&lt;/ref&gt; Armenian historian Ghevond (8th century), describing the invasion of the Khazars in the [[Caucasian Albania]] in 730 AD, mentioned area “Atshi-Baguan”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediterranee-antique.info/Moyen_Age/Divers/Ghevond.htm Histoire des guerres et des conquetes des Arabes en Armenie, par l’eminent Ghevond, vardabet armenien, ecrivain du huitieme siecle]&lt;/ref&gt; Sarah Ashurbeyli notes that the “Atsh” is distorted “Atesh” (“fire”) and “Atshi-Baguan” means “Fires of Baguan” referring to [[Baku]]. Word “Baguan” comes from the word “Baga” which means “God” in [[Old Persian]].&lt;ref&gt;С. Ашурбейли. «История города Баку: период средневековья». Изд. Абилов, Зейналов и братья, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and "Bhagawan" also means God in [[Sanskrit]].{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

"Seven holes with eternal fires" were mentioned by German traveler [[Engelbert Kaempfer]] who visited Surakhani in 1683.&lt;ref&gt;Amoenitatum exoticarum politico-physico-medicarum fasciculi v, quibus continentur variae relationes, observationes &amp; descriptiones rerum Persicarum &amp; ulterioris Asiae, multâ attentione, in peregrinationibus per universum Orientum, collecta, ab auctore Engelberto Kaempfero. Lemgoviae, Typis &amp; impensis H.W. Meyeri, 1712.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Estakhri]] (10th century) mentioned that not far from Baku (i.e., on the Apsheron Peninsula) lived fire worshippers.&lt;ref&gt;Abu Ishaq Ibrahim ibn Muhammad al-Farisi al Istakhri. Ketāb al-masālek wa’l-mamālek&lt;/ref&gt; This was confirmed by [[Movses Kaghankatvatsi|Movses Daskhurantsi]] in his reference of the province of Bhagavan (“Fields of the Gods” i.e., “Fire Gods”).&lt;ref&gt;History of the Caucasian Albanians by Movses Dasxuranci. Translated by C. J. F. Dowsett. London, 1961&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, Atashgah was visited by Zoroastrians. The Persian handwriting Naskh inscription over the entrance aperture of one of the cells, which speaks about the visit of Zoroastrians from Isfahan:

:Persian inscription:
{{Cquote|
آتشی صف کشیده همچون دک

جیی بِوانی رسیده تا بادک
 
سال نو نُزل مبارک باد گفت
 
خانۀ شد رو سنامد (؟) سنة ۱۱۵٨
}}

:Transliteration of Persian inscription:

::''ātaši saf kešide hamčon dak''
::''jey bovāni reside tā bādak''
::''sāl-e nav-e nozl mobārak bād goft''
::''xāne šod ru *sombole sane-ye hazār-o-sad-o-panjāh-o-haštom''

:Translation:&lt;ref&gt;Нейматова М. С.Корпус эпиграфических памятников Азербайджана, т. I, Баку, Елм, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

::''Fires stand in line''
::''Esfahani Bovani came to Badak [Baku]''

::"Blessed the lavish New Year", he said'':
::''The house was built in the month of Ear in year 1158.''

The 1158 year corresponds to 1745 AD. Bovan (modern Bovanat) is the village near Esfahan. The word Badak is a diminutive of Bad-Kubeh. (The name of Baku in the sources of the 17th and 18th centuries was Bad-e Kube). At the end of the reference is the constellation of Sombole /Virgo (August–September). In the name of the month the master mistakenly shifted the “l” and “h” at the end of the word. According to [[Zoroastrian calendar|Zoroastrian calendar Qadimi]] New Year in 1745 AD was in August.

Interesting information about Zoroastrianism in Baku is given by D. Shapiro in ''A [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite]] from [[Volyn Oblast|Wolhynia]] meets a Zoroastrian from Baku''.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Shapira, “A Karaite from Wolhynia Meets a Zoroastrian from Baku,” in Iran and the Caucasus, Vol. 5, No. 1, 2001, pp. 105-106&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abraham Firkovich|Avraham Firkowicz]], a Karaite collector of ancient manuscripts, wrote about his meeting in Darband in 1840 with a fire-worshipper from Baku. Firkowicz asked him “Why do you worship fire?” The fire-worshipper replied that he worshipped not fire, but the Creator symbolised by fire - a “matter” or abstraction (and hence not a person) called ''Q’rţ’ ''. Pahlavi ''Q’rţ’ '' (from [[Avestan]] ''kirdar'' or Sanskrit "kṛt" and "कर्ता") signifies  “one who does” or “creator”.

Some scholars have speculated that the Ateshgah may have been an ancient Zoroastrian shrine that was decimated by invading Islamic armies during the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]] and its neighboring regions.&lt;ref name="modi1926"&gt;{{Citation | title=My Travels Outside Bombay: Iran, Azerbaijan, Baku | author=Ervad Shams-Ul-Ulama Jivanji Jamshedji Modi, Translated by Soli Dastur | year=1926 | publisher= | isbn= | url=http://www.avesta.org/modi/baku.htm | quote=''...

One early European commentator, [[Jonas Hanway]], bucketed Zoroastrians, Sikhs, and Hindus together with respect to their religious beliefs: "''These opinions, with a few alterations, are still maintained by some of the posterity of the ancient Indians and Persians, who are called Gebers or Gaurs, and are very zealous in preserving the religion of their ancestors; particularly in regard to their veneration for the element of fire.''"&lt;ref name="hanway1753" /&gt; [[Gabr|Geber]] is a Persian term for Zoroastrians, while [[Goud Saraswat Brahmin|Gaurs]] are a priestly Hindu and Sikhcaste. A later scholar, [[A. V. Williams Jackson]], drew a distinction between the two groups. While stating that "''the typical features which Hanway mentions are distinctly Indian, not Zoroastrian''" based on the worshipers' attires and [[tilaka]]s, their strictly vegetarian diets and open veneration for cows, he left open the possibility that a few "''actual Gabrs (i.e. Zoroastrians, or Parsis)''" may also have been present at the shrine alongside larger Hindu and Sikh groups.&lt;ref name="jackson1911" /&gt;

===Zoroastrian local residents and pilgrims===
[[File:Karavan saray on Ateshgah.jpg|245px|thumb|Drawing of the temple from the book "Journey in Dagestan and the Caucasus"]]
There are some data that in addition to the Hindus in the temple were present Zoroastrians (Parsis and Guebres) and Sikhs.
Chardin in the 17th century reported about Persian Guebres, which worshiped forever burning fire that was in two days' journey from Shemakha (on the Apsheron).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=tpQOAAAAQAAJ&amp;vq=Igmcoles&amp;dq=related%3AOXFORD555089148&amp;hl=ru&amp;pg=PA311#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Chardin J.

French Jesuit Villotte, who lived in Azerbaijan since 1689, reports that Ateshgah revered by Hindus, Sikhs, and Zoroastrians, the descendants of the ancient Persians.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MQsPAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Voyage+d%25E2%2580%2599un+missionnaire+de+la+Compagnie+de+J%25C3%25A9sus+en+Turquie&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BBnluidwBi&amp;sig=fnBZSnJwTj1BgKN-e8TtdImCI_I&amp;hl=ru&amp;ei=Ce9XTYCiL4O88gaKoKCZBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=r J.

J. Hanway visited Baku in 1747 and left few records of Ateshgah. People, who worshiped fire in Ateshgah he calls "Indians", "Persians" and “Guebres”.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=etApAAAAYAAJ Jonas Hanway.

In 1820 the French consul Gamba visits the temple. According to Gamba here lived Hindus, Sikhs, and Zoroastrians, the followers of Zoroaster.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZUJCAAAAcAAJ&amp;dq=related:HARVARD32044004538021&amp;hl=ru&amp;pg=PA299#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Jean Françoise Gamba.

German Baron Max Thielmann visited the temple in October 1872 and in his memoirs he wrote that Parsi community of Bombay sent here a priest who after a few years will be replaced. His presence is necessary, because here come the pilgrims from the outskirts of Persia (Yazd, Kerman) and from India and remain in this sacred place for several months or years.&lt;ref&gt;Thielmann, Journey in the Caucasus, Persia, and Turkey in Asia, Eng. tr. by Heneage, 2. 9-12, London, 1876&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1876 English traveler James Bruce visited Ateshgah. He noted that the Bombay Parsi Punchayat provides a permanent presence in the temple of their priest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ei=4jxLTOTTMJOlOL21mZYD&amp;ct=result&amp;id=2rVkZAViqtcC&amp;dq=Transcaucasia+and+Ararat&amp;q=fire#v=snippet&amp;q=Parsee&amp;f=false James Bryce.

E. Orsolle, who visited the temple after Bruce, said that after Parsi priest died in 1864, the Parsi Punchayat of Bombay a few years later sent another priest here, but the pilgrims who came here from India and Iran have already forgotten the sanctuary, and in 1880 there was nobody.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/006773380 E.

===Inscriptions and likely period of construction===

[[File:Заброшенный Атешгях, начало 20 в..JPG|thumb|245px|Ateshgah, beginning of 20th century]]
There are several inscriptions on the Ateshgah. They are all in either [[Sanskrit]] or [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], with the exception of one Persian inscription that occurs below an accompanying Sanskrit invocation to Lord [[Ganesha]] and [[Jwala Ji]].&lt;ref name="jackson1911"&gt;{{Citation | title=From Constantinople to the home of Omar Khayyam: travels in Transcaucasia and northern Persia for historic and literary research | author=Abraham Valentine Williams Jackson | year=1911 | publisher=The Macmillan company | isbn= | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z4aBAAAAIAAJ | quote=''... they are now wholly substantiated by the other inscriptions ...

The inscriptions in the temple in [[Sanskrit]] (in Nagari [[Devanagari]] script) and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] (in [[Gurmukhi]] script) identify the site as a place of [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Sikh]] worship,&lt;ref name="AVWJ"&gt;{{citation|last=Jackson|first=Abraham Valentine Williams|title=From Constantinople to the home of Omar Khayyam|publisher=McMillan|location=London|year=1911|chapter=&lt;!--Chapter IV--&gt;The Oil Fields and Fire Temple Baku|chapter-url=http://www.vohuman.org/Library/The%20Oil%20Field%20and%20Fire%20Temp%20at%20Surakhany/The%20Oil%20Fields%20and%20the%20Fire%20Temple%20of%20Baku.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="modi1926" /&gt; and state it was built and consecrated for [[Jwala Ji]],&lt;ref name="AVWJ" /&gt; the modern Hindu fire deity.

V. Williams Jackson]]) suggested the current structure may have been modeled.&lt;ref name="AVWJ" /&gt; However, other scholars have stated that some Jwala Ji devotees used to refer to the Kangra shrine as the 'smaller Jwala Ji' and the Baku shrine as the 'greater Jwala Ji'.&lt;ref name="modi1926" /&gt; Other deities mentioned in the inscriptions include [[Ganesha]] and [[Shiva]].

[[File:Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary b4 738-0.jpg|thumb|245px|Illustration from Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary (1890—1907)]]
In 1876, [[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce|James Bryce]] visited the region and found that "the most remarkable mineral product is [[naphtha]], which bursts forth in many places, but most profusely near Baku, on the coast of the Caspian, in strong springs, some of which are said to always be burning." Without referencing the Atashgah by name, he mentioned of the Zoroastrians that "after they were extirpated from Persia by the Mohammedans, who hate them bitterly, some few occasionally slunk here on pilgrimage" and that "under the more tolerant sway of the Czar, a solitary priest of fire is maintained by the Parsee community of Bombay, who inhabits a small temple built over one of the springs".&lt;ref name="bryce1878"&gt;{{citation|last=Bryce|first=James|title=Transcaucasia and Ararat: Being Notes of a Vacation Tour in the Autumn Of 1876|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FXgciRUra7kC|location=London|publisher=Macmillan|year=1878}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The temple was examined in the late 19th and early 20th century by Parsi [[dastur]]s, some of whom had also visited the Jwala Ji at Kangra in the Himalayas.&lt;ref name="modi1926-2"&gt;{{Citation | title=My Travels Outside Bombay: Iran, Azerbaijan, Baku | author=Ervad Shams-Ul-Ulama Jivanji Jamshedji Modi, Translated by Soli Dastur | year=1926 | publisher= | isbn= | url=http://www.avesta.org/modi/baku.htm | quote=''...

Until then (and again today), the site was visited by Zoroastrian pilgrims from India. In his ''Travels Outside Bombay'', Modi observed that "not just me but any Parsee who is a little familiar with our Hindu or Sikh brethren's religion, their temples and their customs, after examining this building with its inscriptions, architecture, etc., would conclude that this is not a [Zoroastrian&lt;!-- the original word here was "Parsee", but there is an archaic form of the term Zoroastrian --&gt;] [[Fire temple|Atash Kadeh]] but is a Hindu Temple and Gurdawa, whose [[Brahmin]]s (priests) used to worship fire (Sanskrit: [[Agni]])."&lt;ref name="modi1926-2" /&gt;

Besides the physical evidence indicating that the complex was a Hindu place of worship, the existing structural features are not consistent with those for any other Zoroastrian or Sikh places of worship (for instance, cells for ascetics, fireplace open to all sides, ossuary pit and no water source.&lt;ref name="modi1926-2" /&gt; It cannot be ruled out that the site may once have been a Zoroastrian place of worship.

J. Unvala visited temple in 1935 and noted that its structure is pure Sasanian style.&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Unvala. Inscriptions from Surihani near Baku&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exhaustion of the natural gas===
[[File:USSHER(1865) p012 BAKU, FIRE TEMPLE.jpg|thumb|245px|The fire temple of Baku, c. 1860]]
The fire was once fed by a vent from a subterranean [[natural gas field]] located directly beneath the complex, but heavy exploitation of the natural gas reserves in the area during [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] rule resulted in the flame going out in 1969. Today, the museum's fire is fed by mains gas piped in from Baku city.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Elliot|first=Mark|title=Azerbaijan with Excursions to Georgia|edition=3rd|year=2004|page=153|location=Hindhead, UK|publisher=Trailblazer Publications}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last = Byrne| first = Ciar| title = Man-made wonders of the world under threat from war, want and tourism | publisher = The Independent| date = February 2, 2005| url = https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/manmade-wonders-of-the-world-under-threat-from-war-want-and-tourism-483330.html}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Aztec religion''' is the [[Mesoamerican religion]] of the [[Aztecs]]. Like other Mesoamerican religions, it had elements of [[human sacrifice]] in connection with a large number of [[religious festival]]s which were held according to patterns of the [[Aztec calendar]]. [[Polytheistic]] in its [[theology]], the [[religion]] recognized a large and ever increasing [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] of gods and goddesses; the Aztecs would often incorporate [[Deity|deities]] whose cults came from other geographic regions or peoples [[Syncretism|into their own religious practice]]. 
Aztec [[cosmology]] divides the world into thirteen [[Celestial spheres|heavens]] and nine earthly layers or [[Underworld|netherworlds]] (the first heaven overlapping with the first terrestrial layer, heaven and earth meeting at the surface of the Earth), each level associated with a specific set of deities and [[astronomical object]]s. The most important celestial entities in Aztec religion were the [[Sun]], the [[Moon]], and the planet [[Venus]] (both as "morning star" and "evening star")—all of these bearing different symbolic and religious meanings as well as associations with certain deities and geographical places—whose worship was rooted in a significant reverence for the Sun and Moon, whose natural functions are truly of immense importance to life on Earth. They also believed that the sun is their god, and they battled their way to heaven. So the Aztecs call themselves "Warriors of the Sun".

Many leading deities of the Aztec pantheon were worshipped by previous [[History of Mesoamerica|Mesoamerican civilizations]], gods such as [[Tlaloc]], [[Quetzalcoatl]] and [[Tezcatlipoca]], who were venerated by different names in most cultures throughout the history of [[Mesoamerica]]. For the Aztecs especially important deities were the rain god Tlaloc, the god [[Huitzilopochtli]]—patron of the [[Mexica]] tribe—as well as Quetzalcoatl the [[feathered serpent]], wind god, [[culture hero]], and god of civilization and order, and elusive
Tezcatlipoca, the shrewd god of destiny and fortune, connected with [[Aztec warfare|war]] and [[Witchcraft|sorcery]]. Each of these gods had their own shrine, side-by-side at the top of the [[Templo Mayor|largest pyramid]] in the Aztec capital [[Mexico-Tenochtitlan]]—Tlaloc and Huitzilopochtli were both worshipped here at this dual temple, while a third monument in the plaza before the Templo Mayor was devoted to the wind god [[Ehecatl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mexicolore.co.uk/aztecs/gods/study-the-wind-god|title=Study the... WIND GOD|publisher=Mexicolore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teotl==
{{main article|Teotl}} 
The concept of ''Teotl'' is central to the '''Aztecs'''. 
The term is often translated as "[[deity|god]]", but may have held more abstract aspects of divinity or supernatural energy akin to the Polynesian concept of [[Mana]].&lt;ref&gt;Taube and Miller 1999, pp 89. For a lengthy treatment of the subject see Hvidtfeldt, 1958&lt;/ref&gt;

The nature of ''Teotl'' is a key element in the understanding of the fall of the [[Aztec|Aztec empire]], because it seems that the Aztec ruler [[Moctezuma II]] and the Aztecs in general referred to [[Hernán Cortés|Cortés]] and the conquistadors as "Teotl"—it has been widely believed that this means that they believed them to be gods, but a better understanding of "Teotl" might suggest that they were merely seen as "mysterious" or "inexplicable".&lt;ref&gt;Restall 2001 pp 11.6–118&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pantheon==
{{Further information|Aztec mythology}}
The many gods of the Aztecs can be grouped into complexes related to different themes. The Aztecs would often adopt gods from different cultures and allow them to be worshiped as part of their pantheon – the [[fertility god]], [[Xipe Totec]], for example, was originally a god of the Yopi (the Nahuatl name of the [[Tlapanec people]]) but became an integrated part of the Aztec belief system; sometimes foreign gods would be identified with an already existing god. Other deities, for example Tezcatlipoca and Quetzalcoatl, had roots in earlier civilizations of Mesoamerica and were worshiped by many cultures and by many names. Some gods embodied aspects of nature. A large group of gods were related to [[pulque]], drunkenness, excess, fun and games. Other gods were associated with specific trades. Many gods had multiple aspects with different names, where each name highlighted a specific function or trait of the god. Occasionally, two distinct gods were conflated into one, and quite often deities transformed into one another within a single story. Aztec images sometimes combined attributes of several divinities.

Aztec scholar [[H. B. Nicholson]] (1971) classed the gods into three groups according to their conceptual meaning in general Mesoamerican religion. The first group he called the "Celestial creativity – Divine Paternalism group", the second, the Earth-mother gods, the [[Centzon Totochtin|pulque gods]] and Xipe Totec. The third group, the War-Sacrifice-Sanguinary Nourishment group contained such gods as Ome Tochtli, Huitzilopochtli, Mictlantecutli and Mixcoatl. Instead of Nicholson's subtle classification in the following a more impressionist{{Elucidate|date=January 2017}} classification is presented.

==Religion and society==
Religion was part of all levels of Aztec society. On the state level, religion was controlled by the [[Tlatoani]] and the high priests governing the main temples in the ceremonial precinct of the Aztec capital of [[Tenochtitlan]]. This level involved the large monthly festivals and a number of specific rituals centered around the ruler dynasty and attempting to stabilize both the political and cosmic systems, these rituals were the ones that involved a sacrifice of humans. For example, on the feast of [[Huey Tozoztli]], the ruler himself ascended [[Mount Tlaloc]] and engaged in [[autosacrifice]] in order to petition the rains. Throughout society, each level had their own rituals and deities and played their part in the larger rituals of the community. For example, the class of [[Pochteca]] merchants were involved in the feast [[Tlaxochimaco]] where the merchant deity would be celebrated and slaves bought on specific slave markets by long-distance traders would be sacrificed. On the feast of [[Ochpaniztli]], all commoners participated in sweeping the streets, and they also undertook ritual bathing. The most spectacular ritual was the [[New Fire ceremony]] which took place every 52 years and involved every citizen of the Aztec realm, during this commoners would destroy house utensils, quench all fires and receive new fire from the bonfire on top of Mt. Huixachtlan, lit on the chest of a sacrificed person by the high priests.

==Priests and temples==
In the Nahuatl language, the word for priest was ''tlamacazqui'' meaning "giver of things"—the main responsibility of the priesthood was to make sure that the gods were given their due in the form of offerings, ceremonies and sacrifices.

The [[Tlatoani]] of Tenochtitlan was the head of the cult of [[Huitzilopochtli]] and thus of the state religion of the Aztec empire. He had special priestly duties in different rituals on the state level.

However, the Aztec religious organization was not entirely under his authority. Sahagun and Duran describe the pairs of high priests (Quetzalcoatls) who were in charge of the major pilgrimage centres ([[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Cholula]] and Tenochtitlan) as enjoying immense respect from all levels of Aztec society – akin to archbishops – and a level of authority that partly transcended national boundaries. Under these religious heads were many tiers of priests, priestesses, novices, 'nuns' and 'monks' (some part-time) who ran the cults of the various gods and goddesses. Sahagun reports that the priests had a very strict training, and had to live very austere and ethical lives involving prolonged vigils, fasts and penances. For instance, they often had to bleed themselves and undertake prescribed self-mortifications in the buildup to sacrificial rites.

Additionally, Sahagun refers to classes of religious specialists not affiliated with the established priesthood. This included wandering curers, black magicians and other occultists (of which the Aztecs identified many types, most of which they feared) and hermits. Finally, the military orders, professions (e.g. traders – pochteca) and wards (calpulli) each operated their own lodge dedicated to their specific god. The heads of these lodges, although not full-time religious specialists, had some ritual and moral duties. Duran also describes lodge members as having the responsibility of raising sufficient goods to host the festivals of their specific patron deity. This included annually obtaining and training a suitable slave or captive to represent and die as the 'image' of their deity in that festival.

Aztec temples were basically offering mounds: solid pyramidal structures crammed with special soils, sacrifices, treasures and other offerings. Buildings around the base of the pyramid, and sometimes a small chamber under the pyramid, stored ritual items and provided lodgings and staging for priests, dancers and temple orchestras. The pyramids were buried under a new surface every several years (especially every 52 years – the Aztec century). Thus the pyramid-temples of important deities constantly grew in size.

In front of every major temple lay a large plaza. This sometimes held important ritual platforms such as the 'eagle stone' where some victims were slain. Plazas were where the bulk of worshippers gathered to watch rites and dances performed; to join in the songs and sacrifices (the audience often bled themselves during the rites) and to partake in any festival foods. Nobility sat on tiered seating under awnings around the plaza periphery, and some conducted part of the ceremonies on the temple.

Continual rebuilding enabled Tlatoani and other dignitaries to celebrate their achievements by dedicating new sculptures, monuments and other renovations to the temples. For festivals, temple steps and tiers were also festooned with flowers, banners and other decorations. Each pyramid had a flat top to accommodate dancers and priests performing rites. Close to the temple steps there was usually a sacrificial slab and braziers.

The temple house (calli) itself was relatively small, although the more important ones had high and ornately carved internal ceilings. To maintain the sanctity of the gods, these temple houses were kept fairly dark and mysterious – a characteristic that was further enhanced by having their interiors swirling with smoke from copal (incense) and the burning of offerings. Cortes and Diaz describe these sanctuaries as containing sacred images and relics of the gods, often bejeweled but shrouded under ritual clothes and other veils, and hidden behind curtains hung with feathers and bells. Flowers and offerings (including a great amount of blood) generally covered much of the floors and walls near these images. Each image stood on a pedestal and occupied its own sanctuary. Larger temples also featured subsidiary chambers ('little houses') accommodating lesser deities.

In the ceremonial center of Tenochtitlan, the most important temple was the [[Templo Mayor|Great Temple]] which was a double pyramid with two temples on top. One was dedicated to Huitzilopochtli this temple was called ''Coatepetl'' "snake mountain", and the other temple was dedicated to Tlaloc. Below the Tlatoani were the high priests of these two temples. Both high priests were called by the title [[Quetzalcoatl]] – the high priest of Huitzilopochtli was ''Quetzalcoatl Totec Tlamacazqui'' and the high priest of Tlaloc was ''Quetzalcoatl Tlaloc Tlamacazqui''.&lt;ref&gt;Townsend, 1992, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; Other important temples were located in the four divisions of the town: for example the temple called ''[[Yopico]]'' in ''Moyotlan'' which was dedicated to [[Xipe Totec]]. Furthermore, all the [[Calpulli]]s had special temples dedicated to the patron gods of the calpulli.&lt;ref&gt;Van Zantwijk 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Priests were educated at the [[Calmecac]] if they were from noble families and in the [[Telpochcalli]] if they were commoners.

==Cosmology and ritual==
[[File:Xiuhtecuhtli 1.jpg|350px|thumb|left| Aztec cosmological drawing with the god Xiuhtecuhtli, the lord of fire and of the Calendar in the center and the other important gods around him each in front of a sacred tree. From the [[Codex Fejérváry-Mayer]].]]

The Aztec world consisted of three main parts: the earth world on which humans lived (including [[Tamoanchan]], the [[mythical place|mythical origin]] of human beings), an underworld which belonged to the dead (called [[Mictlan]], "place of death"), and the upper plane in the sky. The earth and the underworld were both open for humans to enter, whereas the upper plane in the sky was impenetrable to humans. Existence was envisioned as straddling the two worlds in a cycle of birth, life, death and rebirth. Thus as the sun was believed to dwell in the underworld at night to rise reborn in the morning and maize kernels were interred to later sprout anew, so the human and divine existence was also envisioned as being cyclical. The upper and nether worlds were both thought to be layered. Mictlan had nine layers which were inhabited by different deities and mythical beings. The sky had thirteen layers, the highest of which was called [[Omeyocan]] ("place of duality") and served as the residence of the progenitor dual god [[Ometeotl]]. The lowest layer of the sky was a verdant spring-like place with abundant water called [[Tlalocan]] ("the place of Tlaloc").

After death the soul of the Aztec went to one of three places: the sun, Mictlan, or Tlalocan. Souls of fallen warriors and women that died in childbirth would transform into hummingbirds that followed the sun on its journey through the sky. Souls of people who died from less glorious causes would go to [[Mictlan]]. Those who drowned would go to [[Tlalocan]].&lt;ref name="Tue"&gt;Tuerenhout, D. V. (2005). ''The Aztecs: New Perspectives''&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In Aztec cosmology, as in Mesoamerica in general, geographical features such as caves and mountains held symbolic value as places of crossing between the upper and nether worlds. The cardinal directions were symbolically connected to the religious layout of the world as well; each direction was associated with specific colors and gods.

To the Aztecs, death was instrumental in the perpetuation of creation, and gods and humans alike had the responsibility of sacrificing themselves in order to allow life to continue. This worldview is best described in the myth of the [[five suns]] recorded in the Codex Chimalpopoca, which recounts how Quetzalcoatl stole the bones of the previous generation in the underworld, and how later the gods created four successive worlds or "suns" for their subjects to live in, all of which were destroyed. Then by an act of [[sacrifice|self-sacrifice]], one of the gods, [[Nanahuatzin]] ("the pimpled one") caused a fifth and final sun to rise where the first humans, made out of maize dough, could live thanks to his sacrifice. Humans were responsible for the sun's continued revival. Blood sacrifice in various forms were conducted. Both humans and animals were sacrificed, depending on the god to be placated and the ceremony being conducted, and priests of some gods were sometimes required to provide their own blood through self-mutilation.
	
Sacrificial rituals among the Aztecs and in Mesoamerica, in general, must be seen in the context of religious cosmology: sacrifice and death was necessary for the continued existence of the world. Likewise, each part of life had one or more deities associated with it and these had to be paid their dues in order to achieve success. Gods were paid with sacrificial offerings of food, flowers, effigies, and [[quail]]. But the larger the effort required of the god, the greater the sacrifice had to be. Blood-fed the gods and kept the sun from falling. For some of the most important rites, a priest would offer his own blood, by cutting his ears, arms, tongue, thighs, chest or genitals, or offer a human life or even a god's life. The people who were sacrificed came from many segments of society, and might be a war captive, slave, or a member of Aztec society; the sacrifice might also be man or woman, adult or child, noble or commoner.

===Deity impersonation===
An important aspect of Aztec ritual was the impersonation of deities.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Priests or otherwise specially elected individuals would be dressed up to achieve the likeness of a specific deity.{{Cn|date=September 2018}} A person with the honourable charge of impersonating a god was called "''ixiptlatli''" and was venerated as an actual physical manifestation of the god until the inevitable end when the god's likeness had to be killed as the ultimate sacrifice under great circumstance and festivities.{{Cn|date=September 2018}}

===Reenactment of myth===
As with the impersonation of gods, Aztec ritual was often a reenactment of a mythical event which at once served to remind the Aztecs of their myths but also served to perpetuate the world by repeating the important events of the creation.

==Calendar==
{{main article|Aztec calendar}}
The Aztec religious year was connected mostly to the natural 365-day calendar, the [[xiuhpohualli]] ("yearcount") – which followed the agricultural year. Each of the 18 twenty-day months of the religious year had its particular religious festival – most of which were connected to agricultural themes. The greatest festival was the ''Xiuhmolpilli'' or [[New Fire ceremony]] held every 52 years when the ritual and agricultural calendars coincided and a new cycle started. In the table below, the veintena festivals are shown, the deities with which they were associated and the kinds of rituals involved. The descriptions of the rites are based on the descriptions given in [[Bernardino de Sahagún|Sahagúns]] "''Primeros Memoriales''", and the [[Florentine Codex]] and of Fray [[Diego Durán]]s "Of the Gods and rites" – all of which provide detailed accounts of the rituals written in Nahuatl soon after the conquest.

==Mythology==
{{main article|Aztec mythology}}
The main [[deity]] in the Mexica religion was the [[sun god]] and [[List of war deities|war god]], [[Huitzilopochtli]]. He directed the Mexicas to found a city on the site where they would see an [[eagle]], devouring (not all chronicles agree on what the eagle was devouring, one says it was a precious bird, and though Father Duran says it was a snake, this is not mentioned in any pre-Hispanic source) perched on a fruit bearing [[nopal]] cactus. According to legend, Huitzilopochtli had to kill his nephew, Cópil, and throw his heart on the lake. But, since Cópil was his relative, Huitzilopochtli decided to honor him, and caused cactus to grow over Cópil's heart which became a sacred place.

Legend has it that this is the site on which the Mexicas built their [[Capital (political)|capital city]] of [[Tenochtitlan]]. Tenochtitlan was built on an island in the middle of [[Lake Texcoco]] where modern-day [[Mexico City]] is located. This legendary vision is pictured on the [[Coat of Arms of Mexico]].

According to their own history, when the Mexicas arrived in the [[Anahuac Valley]] around Lake Texcoco, they were considered by the other groups as the least civilized of all. The Mexicas decided to learn, and they took all they could from other peoples, especially from the ancient [[Toltec]] (whom they seem to have partially confused with the more ancient civilization of [[Teotihuacan]]). To the Mexicas, the Toltecs were the originators of all culture; "Toltecayotl" was a synonym for culture. Mexica legends identify the Toltecs and the cult of [[Quetzalcoatl]] with the mythical city of [[Tollan]], which they also identified with the more ancient Teotihuacan.

In the process, they adopted most of the Toltec/Nahua (code) pantheon, but they also made significant changes in their religion. As the Mexica rose in power, they adopted the Nahua gods at equal status to their own. For instance, Tlaloc was the rain god of all the Nahuatl-speaking peoples. They put their local god Huitzilopochtli at the same level as the ancient Nahua god, and also replaced the Nahua Sun god with their own. Thus, Tlaloc/Huitzilopochtli represents the duality of water and fire, as evidenced by the twin pyramids uncovered near the Zocalo in Mexico City in the late 1970s, and it reminds us of the warrior ideals of the Aztec: the Aztec glyph of war is "burning water".

==Human sacrifice==
{{main article|Human sacrifice in Aztec culture}}
[[File:Codex Magliabechiano (141 cropped).jpg|200px|thumb|Aztec sacrifice]]
[[Human sacrifice]] was practiced on a grand scale throughout the Aztec empire, although the exact figures are unknown. At Tenochtitlán, the principal Aztec city, according to Ross Hassig "between 10,000 and 80,400 persons" were sacrificed over the course of four days for the dedication of the [[Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan|Great Pyramid]] in 1487.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
  | last = Hassig
  | title = El sacrificio y las guerras floridas
  | journal = [[Arqueología mexicana]]
  | volume = XI
  | pages = 47
  | year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excavations of the offerings in the main temple has provided some insight in the process, but the dozens of remains excavated are far short of the thousands of sacrifices recorded by eyewitnesses and other historical accounts. For millennia, the practice of human sacrifice was widespread in [[Mesoamerica]]n and [[South America]]n cultures. It was a theme in the [[Olmec]] religion, which thrived between 1200 BC and 400 BC and among the [[Maya civilization|Maya]]. Human sacrifice was a very complex ritual. Every sacrifice had to be meticulously planned from the type of victim to the specific ceremony needed for the god. The sacrificial victims were usually warriors but sometimes slaves, depending upon the god and needed ritual. The higher the rank of the warrior the better he is looked at as a sacrifice. The victim(s) would then take on the persona of the god he was to be sacrificed for. The victim(s) would be housed, fed, and dressed accordingly. This process could last up to a year. When the sacrificial day arrived, the victim(s) would participate in the specific ceremonies of the god. These ceremonies were used to exhaust the victim so that he would not struggle during the ceremony. Then five priests, known as the [[Tlenamacac]], performed the sacrifice usually at the top of a pyramid. The victim would be laid upon the table, held down and then have his heart cut out.&lt;ref name="Tue"&gt;Tuerenhout, D. V. (2005). ''The Aztecs: New Perspectives''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:KorenGodReposing.jpg|thumb|235px|Illustration from the first engraved Christian Bible in [[Russian (language)|Russian]] (1696), depicting [[God]] reposing on Sabbath.]]

'''Biblical Sabbath''' is a weekly day of [[leisure|rest]] or time of worship given in the Bible as the seventh day. It is observed differently in [[Sabbath in Judaism|Judaism]] and [[Sabbath in Christianity|Christianity]] and informs a similar occasion in several other faiths. Though many viewpoints and definitions have arisen over the millennia, most originate in the same textual tradition of "[[Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy]]".

Observation and remembrance of Sabbath is one of the [[Ten Commandments]] (the fourth in the original [[Jewish]], the [[Eastern Orthodox]], and most [[Protestant]] traditions, the third in [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Lutheran]] traditions), sometimes referred to individually as the ''Sabbath Commandment''. Most people who observe Biblical Sabbath regard it as having been made for man ({{Bibleverse||Mark.|2:27|KJV}}) at Creation ({{Bibleverse||Ex.|20:8–11|KJV}}), and instituted as a perpetual [[covenant (Biblical)|covenant]] for the [[people of Israel]] ({{Bibleverse||Ex.|31:13-17|KJV}}, {{Bibleverse||Ex.|23:12|KJV}}, {{Bibleverse||Deut.|5:13-14|KJV}}), a rule that also [[Proselyte#Rules for proselytes in the Torah|applies to proselytes]], and a sign respecting two events: the seventh day, during which God rested after having completed Creation in six days ({{Bibleverse||Gen.|2:2-3}}, {{Bibleverse||Ex.|20:8-11}}), and God's deliverance of the Israelites [[The Exodus|from Egypt]] ({{Bibleverse||Deut.|5:12-15|NIV}}).

==Etymology==

===Sabbath===
The Anglicized term "Sabbath" is in [[Hebrew]] ''Shabbat'', meaning "day of rest".

[[File:Shabbatai1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sabbatai Zevi]] in 1665.]]
The name form is "Shabbethai"&lt;ref&gt;''Shabb&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;thay'', "restful", 7678&lt;/ref&gt; a name appearing [[Shabbethai (biblical figure)|three times]] in the [[Tanakh]]. The [[Talmud]] also contains a pun on ''shebeth'', where it secondarily means "[[dill]]", a spice. Another related word is modern Hebrew ''shevita'', a [[labor strike]], with the same focus on active cessation of labor. And in over thirty languages other than English, the common name for [[Saturday]] is a cognate of "Sabbath".

A cognate [[Babylonian language|Babylonian]] ''Sapattu&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;'' or ''Sabattu&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;'' is reconstructed from the lost fifth [[Enûma Eliš]] creation account, which is read as: "''[Sa]bbatu'' shalt thou then encounter, mid[month]ly".
It is regarded as a form of [[Sumer]]ian ''sa-bat'' ("mid-rest"), rendered in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] as ''um nuh libbi'' ("day of mid-repose").&lt;ref name=ere&gt;{{cite book
|author=Pinches, T.G.

|chapter=Sabbath (Babylonian)

|isbn=978-0-7661-3698-4
|accessdate=2009-03-17}}
It has been argued that the association of the number seven with creation itself derives from the circumstance that the Enuma Elish was recorded on seven tablets. 
"emphasized by Professor [[George Aaron Barton|Barton]], who says: 'Each account is arranged in a series of sevens, the Babylonian in seven tablets, the Hebrew in seven days. Each of them places the creation of man in the sixth division of its series." Albert T. Clay, ''The Origin of Biblical Traditions: Hebrew Legends in Babylonia and Israel'', 1923, [https://books.google.ch/books?id=JKBLAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA74 p. 74].&lt;/ref&gt;

The dependent Greek cognate is ''Sabbaton'', used in the [[New Testament]] 68 times. Two inflections, Hebrew ''Shabbathown'' and Greek "σαββατισμός" (''Sabbatismós''), also appear. The Hebrew form refers to [[High Sabbaths]]. The Greek form is cognate to the [[Septuagint]] verb ''sabbatizo'' (e.g., {{Bibleverse||Ex.|16:30}}; {{Bibleverse||Lev.|23:32}}; {{Bibleverse-nb||Lev.|26:34}}; {{Bibleverse|2|Chr.|36:21}}). In English, the concept of "[[Sabbatical]]" is cognate to these two forms.

The [[King James Bible]] uses the English form "sabbath(s)" 172 times. In the [[Old Testament]], "sabbath(s)" translates ''Shabbath'' all 107 times (including 35 plurals), plus ''shebeth'' three times, ''shabath'' once, and the related ''mishbath'' once (plural). In the [[New Testament]], "sabbath" translates ''Sabbaton'' 59 times and ''prosabbaton'' once (the day before Sabbath); ''Sabbaton'' is also translated as "week" nine times, by [[synecdoche]].

===Shmita===
{{details|Shmita}}Sabbath Year or ''Shmita'' ({{lang-he|שמטה}}, ''Sh&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;mittah'', literally "release"), also called Sabbatical Year, is the seventh (שביעי, ''sh&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;biy'iy'') year of the seven-year agricultural cycle mandated by [[Torah]] for the [[Land of Israel]], relatively little observed in Biblical tradition, but still observed in contemporary [[Judaism]]. During ''Shmita'', the land is left to lie [[fallow]] and all agricultural activity—including plowing, planting, pruning and harvesting—is forbidden by Torah and [[halakha|Jewish law]].&lt;ref&gt;"Sabbatical Year: every seventh year, during which the land, according to the law of Moses, had to remain uncultivated (Lev. 25:2-7; comp. Ex. 23:10, 11, 12; Lev. 26:34, 35). Whatever grew of itself during that year was not for the owner of the land, but for the poor and the stranger and the beasts of the field." ''Easton's Bible Dictionary'', 1897.&lt;/ref&gt; By tradition, other cultivation techniques (such as watering, fertilizing, weeding, spraying, trimming and mowing) may be performed as preventative measures only, not to improve the growth of trees or plants; additionally, whatever fruits grow of their own accord during that year are deemed ''hefker'' (ownerless), not for the landowner but for the poor, the stranger, and the beasts of the field; these fruits may be picked by anyone. A variety of laws also apply to the sale, consumption and disposal of ''Shmita'' produce. When the year ended, all debts, except those of foreigners, were to be remitted ({{Bibleverse||Deut.|15:1-11|NIV}}); in similar fashion, Torah requires a slave who had worked for six years to go free in the seventh year. [[Leviticus]] 25 promises bountiful harvests to those who observe ''Shmita'', and describes its observance as a test of religious faith. The term ''Shmita'' is translated "release" five times in the [[Book of Deuteronomy]] (from the root שמט, ''shamat'', "''desist'', ''remit''").

==Tanakh==

===Torah===
*[[Book of Genesis]]: In {{Bibleverse-nb||Genesis|1:1-2:4}}, God [[Genesis creation narrative|creates]] the [[heaven]]s and earth in six days (each day is defined as evening and morning) and [[leisure|rests]] on the seventh day, which he thus confers with special status.&lt;blockquote&gt;So God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it God rested from all his work that he had done in Creation. —{{Bibleverse||Gen.|2:3|ESV}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; This passage uses root form ''shabath'', rather than intensified form ''Shabbath''; neither the noun form nor a positive Sabbath command appears in Genesis. In {{Bibleverse-nb||Genesis|8:4}}, [[Noah's ark]] comes to "rest" in the seventh month (later revealed as the month of ''Shabbathown''); here the word for "rest" is not ''shabath'' but its synonym ''nuwach'', the root of [[Noah]]'s name.
*[[Book of Exodus]]: In {{Bibleverse-nb||Exodus|16:23-30}}, immediately after the Exodus from Egypt, Sabbath is revealed as the day upon which [[manna]] and manna gathering is to cease weekly; the first of many Sabbath commands is given, in both positive and negative forms.&lt;blockquote&gt;Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day, which is a Sabbath, there will be none .... Remain each of you in his place; let no one go out of his place on the seventh day. —{{Bibleverse||Ex.|16:26|ESV}}, {{Bibleverse-nb||Exodus|16:29|ESV}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;In {{Bibleverse-nb||Exodus|20:8-11}}, one month later, it is enjoined to be remembered as a memorial of Creation, as one of the [[Ten Commandments]], the covenant revealed after God liberated Israel from Egyptian bondage. &lt;blockquote&gt;[[Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy]]. Six days you shall labor, and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the {{LORD}} your God. On it you shall not do any work .... For in six days the {{LORD}} made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day. Therefore the {{LORD}} blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy. —{{Bibleverse||Ex.|20:8-11|ESV}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; In {{Bibleverse-nb||Exodus|31:12-17}}, Sabbath is affirmed as a perpetual sign and [[covenant (Biblical)|covenant]], and [[Sabbath breaking|Sabbath-breakers]] are officially to be [[list of capital crimes in the Torah|cut off from the assembly or potentially killed]]. Summarized again in {{Bibleverse-nb||Exodus|35:2-3}}, verse 3 also forbids lighting a fire on the Sabbath.
{{Ten Commandments series}}
*[[Book of Leviticus]]: In {{Bibleverse-nb||Leviticus|16:31}}, [[Yom Kippur]] is stated to be "Sabbath of Sabbaths". In {{Bibleverse-nb||Leviticus|19}}, many of the Ten Commandments are repeated, including Sabbath ({{Bibleverse-nb||Leviticus|19:3}}, {{Bibleverse-nb||Leviticus|19:30}}). In {{Bibleverse-nb||Leviticus|23}}, Moses defines weekly Sabbath, along with seven annual [[High Sabbaths]], which do not necessarily occur on weekly Sabbath and are additional to the weekly "{{LORD}}'s Sabbaths". One High Sabbath, [[Day of Atonement]], is specifically defined as occurring from the evening of the prior day until the following evening. In {{Bibleverse-nb||Leviticus|24:8}}, the [[showbread]] is to be laid out in the [[tabernacle]] every Sabbath. In {{Bibleverse-nb||Leviticus|25:2-6}}, ''[[Shmita]]'' is given as a year of rest for land every seven years. In {{Bibleverse-nb||Leviticus|26:2}}, {{Bibleverse-nb||Leviticus|26:34-35}}, {{Bibleverse-nb||Leviticus|26:43}}, Sabbath is again enjoined, and Moses warns of the curse that if Israel disobeys, it will go into exile while the land enjoys Sabbaths denied to it during the time of rebellion.
*[[Book of Numbers]]: In {{Bibleverse-nb||Numbers|15:32-36}}, a man gathering firewood on Sabbath is put to death; the potential punishment for [[Sabbath breaking|desecrating Sabbath]] (stoning) is the most severe in Jewish law. In {{Bibleverse-nb||Numbers|28-29}}, the [[korban|offerings]] for Sabbath, new moon, and High Sabbaths are enjoined.
*[[Book of Deuteronomy]]: In {{Bibleverse-nb||Deuteronomy|5:12-15}}, the Ten Commandments are restated; instead of referring again to Creation, Sabbath is enjoined to be observed as a memorial or sign of [[The Exodus]] and [[Redemption (theology)|Redemption]] of Israel from Egypt under God's protection.

===Prophets===
*[[2 Kings]]: In {{Bibleverse-nb|2|Kings|4:23}}, when [[Elisha]]'s patroness goes away suddenly to seek him, her husband questions why, since it was neither new moon nor Sabbath. In {{Bibleverse-nb|2|Kings|11:5-9}}, [[Jehoash of Judah|Joash]] becomes king, protected from usurper [[Athaliah]] by the additional troops present for changing of duty on Sabbath. In {{Bibleverse-nb|2|Kings|16}}, the colonnade built for Sabbath use and its royal entranceway are removed from the temple by King [[Ahaz]].
*[[Book of Isaiah]]: [[Isaiah]] mentions Sabbath repeatedly, including in its first and last chapters. In {{Bibleverse-nb||Isaiah|1:13}}, he describes corrupted Sabbath tradition, called by God "your" assembly (as opposed to his own). In {{Bibleverse-nb||Isaiah|56:1-8}} and {{Bibleverse-nb||Isaiah|58:13-14}}, Isaiah commends honoring the holiness of Sabbath, rather than using it to go one's own way or to do idly as one pleases. Because of this passage, it is customary, in Judaism, to avoid talk about money or business matters on Sabbath; and, among [[Latter-day Saints]], to give full attention to spiritual matters, to perform only righteous activities, and to prepare only simple foods on Sabbath. In {{Bibleverse-nb||Isaiah|66:22-23}}, he foresees what is understood as the Messianic Kingdom, in which new moons and Sabbaths are occasions for the righteous to worship in God's presence, and to meditate on the unquenched fire consuming the wicked.
*[[Book of Jeremiah]]: In {{Bibleverse-nb||Jeremiah|17:19-27}}, Jeremiah declaims against carrying burdens out of houses or out of the city gates on Sabbath, as was commonly done by merchants in his day. Jeremiah also prophesies that Israel will be a desolation for seventy years ({{Bibleverse-nb||Jeremiah|25:11}}), interpreted later as land Sabbaths as also prophesied by Moses.
*[[Book of Ezekiel]]: In {{Bibleverse-nb||Ezekiel|20:12-26}}, Ezekiel records God's giving of laws, precepts, and Sabbaths, and Israel's rejecting them; Sabbaths are explicitly called a sign between God and Israel. In {{Bibleverse-nb||Ezekiel|22:8}}, {{Bibleverse-nb||Ezekiel|22:23-31}}, {{Bibleverse-nb||Ezekiel|23:38}}, he states that Israel has profaned and hidden its eyes from Sabbath. In {{Bibleverse-nb||Ezekiel|44:24}}, Ezekiel foresees a Messianic Temple, in which the priests keep Sabbath as truly holy. In {{Bibleverse-nb||Ezekiel|45:17}}, {{Bibleverse-nb||Ezekiel|46:1-12}}, he sees the east gate shut on the "six working days" and open on Sabbath and new moon, and a prince making burnt offerings on those festivals as well.
*[[Book of Hosea]]: In {{Bibleverse-nb||Hosea|2:11}}, casting Israel as an adulterous wife, God vows to end "her" festivals, new moons, and Sabbaths.
*[[Book of Amos]]: In {{Bibleverse-nb||Amos|8:5}}, Amos objects to those who inquire when Sabbath or new moon will be over so that marketing can begin again, classifying this practice as comparable to that of dishonest weights.

===Writings===
*[[Book of Psalms]]: {{Bibleverse-nb||Psalm|92}} is a song specifically for Sabbath.
*[[Book of Lamentations]]: In {{Bibleverse-nb||Lamentations|1:7}}, Israel's enemies gloat over its "cessation" (''mishbath''), after the destruction of the first temple. In {{Bibleverse-nb||Lamentations|2:6}}, this destruction and Israel's rejection is linked to Israel forgetting its appointed times and Sabbaths.
*[[Book of Nehemiah]]: In {{Bibleverse-nb||Nehemiah|9:14}}, the Levites, who have called a public fast, thank God for Sabbath, the [[mitzvoth]] (commandments), and the Torah. In {{Bibleverse-nb||Nehemiah|10:31-33}}, the people respond by swearing not to buy on Sabbath or holy day. In {{Bibleverse-nb||Nehemiah|13:15-22}}, Nehemiah observes many kinds of business transacted on Sabbath, rejects it as profanation, locks the city gates for the whole of Sabbath and has them guarded, and threatens force against merchants who spend the night outside. Sabbath begins after evening shadows fall on the gates.
*[[1 Chronicles]]: In {{Bibleverse-nb|1|Chronicles|9:32}}, the task of preparing Sabbath showbread is shown to have been assigned to kinsmen of [[Korah]] from the clan of [[Kohath]]. In {{Bibleverse-nb|1|Chronicles|23:31}}, [[King David]] assigns Levites to stand and sing thanks and praise whenever the burnt offerings are given for Sabbath, new moon, and the other designated days.
*[[2 Chronicles]]: In {{Bibleverse-nb|2|Chronicles|2:4}} (2:3, Hebrew) and {{Bibleverse-nb|2|Chronicles|8:12-13}}, Solomon dedicates the first temple for daily, weekly, monthly, and annual offerings. In {{Bibleverse-nb|2|Chronicles|23:4-8}}, [[Jehoash of Judah|Joash]] becomes king, protected from usurper [[Athaliah]] by the additional troops present for changing of duty on Sabbath. In {{Bibleverse-nb|2|Chronicles|31:3}}, [[Hezekiah]] rededicates the same offerings as Solomon. In the last chapter of the Tanakh in Hebrew order (at {{Bibleverse-nb|2|Chronicles|36:21}}), the prophecies of Moses and Jeremiah are combined as having been fulfilled in seventy years of captivity in [[Babylon]], during which the land kept its Sabbaths.

==New Testament==

===Gospels===
[[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] contain several [[Synoptic Gospels|synoptic]] accounts, which [[Gospel of John|John]] occasionally concurs in.
*[[Exorcism in Capernaum]] ({{Bibleverse||Mk.|1:21-39}}, {{Bibleverse||Lk.|4:31-43}}): Jesus makes a practice of teaching in the [[Capernaum]] synagogue on Sabbath. One Sabbath he exorcises an [[unclean spirit]], and also heals Peter's wife's mother. After sundown that day, he heals many people, and early in the morning of the first day, he goes out to pray alone.
*[[Lord of the Sabbath]] ({{Bibleverse||Mt.|12:1-8}}, {{Bibleverse||Mk.|2:23-28}}, {{Bibleverse||Lk.|6:1-5}}): When his disciples pick heads of wheat and eat them, Jesus tells objectors that, because Sabbath was made for man, the [[Son of Man]] is Lord of Sabbath. Sabbatarians believe that Sabbath-keeping is central to following Christ, and that he highly regarded Sabbath; some non-Sabbatarian Protestants and Catholics believe that Christ has power to [[Abrogation of Old Covenant laws|abrogate]] Sabbath via a "better dispensation", and that he did so as with all [[ceremonial law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.reformed.org/master/index.html?mainframe=/ethics/sabbath/sabbath_Dabney.html|chapter=The Christian Sabbath: Its Nature, Design and Proper Observance|pages=497–8|first=Robert L|last=Dabney|title=Discussions of Robert L. Dabney|volume=1|publisher=Center for Reformed Theology and Apologetics}}&lt;/ref&gt; The doctrine that Christ "made" all Creation ({{Bibleverse||Jn.|1:3-10}}, {{Bibleverse||Col.|1:16}}) implies that "Sabbath was made", and observed, by Christ ({{Bibleverse||Mk.|2:27}}), during Creation; this is taken as earning him the identification "Lord of Sabbath".
*[[Healing of the Withered Hand]] ({{Bibleverse||Mt.|12:9-21}}, {{Bibleverse||Mk.|3:1-6}}, {{Bibleverse||Lk.|6:6-11}}): Knowing he is being watched, Jesus heals a man who had a withered hand, arguing that doing good and saving life is permitted and right on Sabbath. This passage follows his proclamation as Lord of Sabbath in Mark and Luke, but in Matthew follows his quotation of {{Bibleverse||Jer.|6:16}} that he would give rest for his disciples' souls; this is taken as indicating Matthew intended to teach that Sabbath's true or spiritual fulfillment is found in coming to Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lincoln, Prof. Andrew T.|editor=Carson, D. A.|chapter=Sabbath, rest and eschatology in the New Testament|title=From Sabbath to Lord's Day|publisher=Zondervan|date=1982|pages=197–220}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Rejection of Jesus]] ({{Bibleverse||Mk.|6:1-6}}, {{Bibleverse||Lk.|4:16-30}}): As is his custom, Jesus attends the [[Nazareth]] synagogue on Sabbath and [[Lection|stands to read]]. He preaches against skeptical demands for miracles and states that he is rejected there in his hometown.
*Events unique to [[Gospel of John|John]]: In {{Bibleverse-nb||John|5:9-18}}, Jesus heals a paralytic at the [[Pool of Bethesda]] and tells him to carry his mat, spurring accusations of Sabbath-breaking. In {{Bibleverse-nb||John|7:22-23}}, Jesus argues that healing in general is equivalent to permitted Sabbath activity of [[Circumcision in the Bible|circumcision]], regarded as a cleansing ritual. In {{Bibleverse-nb||John|9}}, Jesus makes clay with spittle on Sabbath and heals a man born blind, and is investigated by [[Pharisees]].
*Events unique to [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]]: In {{Bibleverse-nb||Luke|13:10-17}}, Jesus heals a woman who had been bent over double for 18 years, arguing that setting her free is equivalent to permitted Sabbath activity of loosing one's animals to water them. In {{Bibleverse-nb||Luke|14:1-6}}, Jesus heals a man with [[dropsy]] (swollen with fluid), arguing that this is equivalent to permitted Sabbath activity of rescuing an animal from a well. In {{Bibleverse-nb||Luke|18:9-14}}, Jesus' parable of the [[Pharisee and the Publican]], the [[Pharisee]] fasts twice a week, literally twice per Sabbath (the word ''Sabbaton'' means "week" by [[synecdoche]]).
*[[Olivet Discourse]], unique to [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]]: In {{Bibleverse-nb||Matthew|24}}, describing then-future [[apocalypse]]s such as the [[Second Coming]], Jesus requests prayer (at {{Bibleverse-nb||Matthew|24:20}}) that the coming time, when Judah must escape to the hills, not occur in winter or on Sabbath. Sabbatarians believe that Jesus based on this text expected Sabbath to be kept long after his death;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote=After the Christian dispensation was fully set up .... even then Christians were bound to a strict observation of the sabbath.|first=Jonathan|last=Edwards|authorlink=Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|title=First Sermon: The Perpetuity of the Sabbath|url=http://www.westminsterconfession.org/worship/perpetuity-and-change-of-the-sabbath.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; others believe Jesus foresaw a non-Sabbatarian future community hampered by surrounding Sabbatarianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.worldslastchance.com/biblical-christian-beliefs/sabbath-in-the-bible.html|title=Sabbath in the Bible|chapter=The Sabbath and the Gospels|publisher=World's Last Chance|year=2004–2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Crucifixion of Jesus]] ({{Bibleverse||Mt.|27}}, {{Bibleverse||Mk.|15}}, {{Bibleverse||Lk.|23}}, {{Bibleverse||Jn.|19}}): Jesus is crucified on Preparation Day, the day before Sabbath; differing [[chronology of Jesus|chronologies]] interpret this either as [[Good Friday|Friday]] (before weekly Sabbath) or [[Quartodeciman|Nisan 14]] (before High Sabbath) or both. [[Joseph of Arimathaea]] buries him before this Sabbath begins. The women who wished to prepare his body keep Sabbath rest according to the commandment, intending to finish their work on the first day of the week (the day after weekly Sabbath); one reading of the text permits "they rested" to include a hint that the body of Jesus rests on Sabbath as well. Seventh-day Sabbatarians see no change in God's law, regarding it as in force and affirmed by the evangelists after Jesus died on the cross.&lt;ref name=wohlberg/&gt; Others regard Sabbath as changed by the cross, either to Lord's Day or to spiritual Sabbath.
*[[Resurrection of Jesus]] ({{Bibleverse||Mt.|28}}, {{Bibleverse||Mk.|16}}, {{Bibleverse||Lk.|24}}, {{Bibleverse||Jn.|20}}): Jesus is raised from the dead by God and appears publicly on the first day of the week to several women. Jesus appears to Peter and again on the evening beginning the second day (i.e., after two disciples traveled seven miles from [[Emmaus]], having begun when it was almost evening and getting dark, {{Bibleverse||Lk.|24:28-36}}). The text stating that "Jesus rose early on the first day of the week" ({{Bibleverse||Mk.|16:9|NIV}}) is often inferred as speaking indirectly of Sabbath change; this conclusion is not direct in any Scripture, and the verse is not found in the two most ancient manuscripts (the [[Sinaiticus]] and [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209|Vaticanus]]) and some other ancient manuscripts, though it appears in [[Irenaeus]] and [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]] in the second or third century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford NIV Scofield Study Bible|others=[[Cyrus Scofield|Scofield, C.I.]], ed.; English, E. Schuyler, chmn|year=1984|location=[[New York City]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|origyear=1909|page=1047|chapter=Mark 16:9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epistles===
*[[Book of Acts]] 1-18: In {{Bibleverse-nb||Acts|1:12}}, the distance from the [[Mount of Olives]] to [[Jerusalem]] is called a [[Biblical mile|"Sabbath journey"]], the distance Jewish law permitted one to walk on the Sabbath. In {{Bibleverse-nb||Acts|2}}, the [[Holy Spirit|Spirit of God]] is given to the disciples of Christ on [[Pentecost]], who baptize 3,000 people into the apostolic fellowship; though the weekday is not mentioned, this is usually calculated as falling on the day after Sabbath. In {{Bibleverse-nb||Acts|13:13-45}}, {{Bibleverse-nb||Acts|16:13}}, {{Bibleverse-nb||Acts|17:2}}, and {{Bibleverse-nb||Acts|18:4}}, as is his custom, Paul preaches on Sabbath to communal gatherings of Jewish and Gentile Christians, usually in synagogue, in [[Pisidian Antioch]], [[Philippi]], [[Thessalonica]], and [[Corinth]] (the meeting of Philippians was a riverside women's prayer group, in Gentile territory). Seventh-day Sabbatarians believe that Luke's recording Paul's sitting down in the synagogue indicates they kept a rest day and affirmed the seventh day as Sabbath,&lt;ref name=wohlberg/&gt; while others believe that Paul merely preached on days that the Jewish portion of his audience would be available. In {{Bibleverse-nb||Acts|15:19-29}}, the [[Apostolic Decree]], James proposes four limited rules for Gentile [[proselytes]] in response to the question of whether Gentiles should be directed to follow the Mosaic Law; the apostles then write that no greater burden is laid on the Gentiles. James also states that Moses is read every Sabbath, which can be construed either as discounting Moses as too unnecessary to promote (the Law being split into parts with Gentiles ordered to follow only [[Noachide Laws]]), or as supporting Moses as too ubiquitous to promote (the Law being a unity to grow into).
*{{Bibleverse||Acts|20}}: When the Christians meet to break bread, during an all-night worship service in [[Troad|Troas]], Paul preaches and raises Eutychus from the dead, the night after Sabbath (i.e., Saturday night and Sunday morning); the first day had begun at sundown (cf. {{Bibleverse||Judg.|14:17-18}}). Though Paul's special farewell service, this event is otherwise considered a regular Christian [[Eucharist]]ic observance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=The Catholic Encyclopedia|title=Sunday|date=1913|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14335a.htm|quote=The practice of meeting together on the first day of the week for the celebration of the Eucharistic Sacrifice is indicated.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hard Nuts Cracked|year=1940|author=Richards, H.M.S.|page=6|url=http://www.sabbathtruth.com/faq/arguments-refuted/articletype/articleview/articleid/1026/if-the-early-christians-kept-sabbath-.aspx|quote=After all there is nothing in the Scriptures to show that the celebration of the Lord's Supper was confined to any particular day of the week.}} Cf. {{Bibleverse||Acts|2:46}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Paul then immediately walks eighteen miles from Troas to [[Assos]], boards a boat, and continues to [[Mitylene]]. Seventh-day Sabbatarians state that Paul (as a lifelong Sabbath keeper) would not have done so on Sunday, if he had regarded Sunday as Sabbath. Non-Sabbatarians state that Paul did not keep any day of the week as Sabbath (citing his later passages) and that the early church met on the first day of the week but without rigor. First-day Sabbatarians state that he did not extend the travel prohibition to the first day.
*[[Book of Romans]]: In {{Bibleverse-nb||Romans|14:5-6}}, without mentioning Sabbath, Paul emphasizes being fully convinced of one's practice, whether esteeming one day above another, or esteeming every day alike. Each interpretative framework regards this passage as demonstrating that ritual observance of others' Sabbaths is not required, but is optional according to the conscience of each individual Christian.
*[[1 Corinthians]]: In {{Bibleverse-nb|1|Corinthians|11:1}}, Paul exhorts readers to follow his example in religious practice as he follows Christ's. In {{Bibleverse-nb|1|Corinthians|16:1-2}}, Paul encourages the setting aside of money on the day after Sabbath for a collection for the Christians in Jerusalem; it is not stated whether this is in conjunction with a first-day group meeting. As in {{Bibleverse||Acts|20}}, the word "week" translates ''Sabbaton'' in "the first day of the week".
*[[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]]: In {{Bibleverse-nb||Galatians|4:10-11}}, spiritual enslavement to special days, months, seasons, and years is rejected. In context, Paul speaks of enslavement to "the elemental things of the world" and "those weak and miserable principles" ({{Bibleverse-nb||Galatians|4:3}}, {{Bibleverse-nb||Galatians|4:9}}), and allegorizes the Israelites as "children who are to be slaves" ({{Bibleverse-nb||Galatians|4:24}}). The theme of {{Bibleverse-nb||Galatians|5}} is freedom. Seventh-day Sabbatarians believe Paul was promoting freedom in Sabbath observance and rejecting either observance of non-Levitical [[Gnostic]] practices, or else [[legalism (theology)|legalistic]] observance of Biblical festivals (cf. {{Bibleverse||Col.|2:9-17}});&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jewish New Testament Commentary|author=Stern, David H.|date=1992|publisher=Jewish New Testament Publications, Inc.|location=[[Clarksville, Maryland]]|isbn=965-359-008-1|page=557|chapter=Notes on Gal. 4:8-10|quote=When Gentiles observe these Jewish holidays ... out of fear induced by Judaizers who have convinced them that unless they do these things, God will not accept them, then they are not obeying the ''Torah'' but subjugating themselves to legalism .... An alternative interpretation, however, is that the 'days, months, seasons and years' of this passage do not refer to the Jewish holidays at all but to pagan Gentile feasts, naturally and directly reflecting 'those weak and miserable elemental spirits.' According to this understanding Sha'ul was worried that his ex-pagan converts might be returning to these pagan festivals.}}&lt;/ref&gt; others believe Paul spoke about Judaizers and was rejecting seventh-day Sabbath as not prescribed in the New Covenant, represented by [[Mount Zion]] above and by freedom.
*[[Colossians]]: In {{Bibleverse-nb||Colossians|2:9-17}}, the rule is laid down that no one should pass judgment on anyone else in regard to High Sabbaths, new moon, and Sabbath. Paul states that these yet remain as a shadow of Messianic events that are still coming as of his writing. The withholding of judgment has been interpreted variously as indicating either maintenance, transference, or abolition of Sabbath. First-day Sabbatarians and non-Sabbatarians often regard the Mosaic law as being the "record of debt" (ESV) nailed to the cross. Some seventh-day Sabbatarians regard only High Sabbaths as abolished due to their foreshadowing the cross, holding it impossible for weekly Sabbath (which preceded sin) to foreshadow deliverance from sin in the cross.&lt;ref name=lostday6&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.sabbathtruth.com/faq/advanced-topics/the-lost-day-of-history.aspx|title=The Lost Day Of History|chapter=6. Doesn't Colossians 2:14-17 do away with the seventh-day Sabbath?|publisher=Amazing Facts|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others regard Sabbath, new moon, and High Sabbaths not as nailed to the cross but as foreshadowing the eternal plan of God.&lt;ref name=howard&gt;{{cite book|last=Howard|first=Kevin|title=The Feasts of the Lord|year=1997|publisher=Zion's Hope|isbn=978-0-7852-7518-3 |pages=224|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YTCsOwAACAAJ&amp;dq=the+feasts+of+the+lord&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=thPjTseeM8TetgePvqHoAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Book of Hebrews]]: In {{Bibleverse-nb||Hebrews|4:1-11}}, Sabbath texts are analyzed with the conclusion that some form of Sabbath-keeping (''sabbatismos'') remains for God's people; the term generically means any literal or spiritual Sabbath-keeping.
*[[Book of Revelation|Revelation]]: In {{Bibleverse-nb||Revelation|1:10}}, [[John the Beloved]] states that he was "in Spirit" in the "[[Lord's Day]]", a term apparently familiar to his readers, without mentioning Sabbath. First-day Sabbatarians hold that this means he was worshipping on [[Sunday]], the day of Christ's resurrection (cf. {{Bibleverse||Acts|20:7}}, {{Bibleverse|1|Cor.|16:2}}, later [[patristic]] writings). Seventh-day Sabbatarians hold that this means he was brought by the Spirit into a vision of the [[Day of the Lord]] (cf. {{Bibleverse||Is.|58:13-14}}, etc.). Both lay claim to the name "Lord's Day" for Sabbath. In {{Bibleverse-nb||Revelation|20:1-10}}, the millennial reign of Christ is described, which is often interpreted as a seventh (Sabbatical) [[millennium]].

==Apocrypha==
*[[1 Esdras]]: {{Bibleverse-nb|1|Esdras|1:58}} quotes {{Bibleverse|2|Chr.|36:21}}, relying on the prophecies of {{Bibleverse||Jer.|25}} and of {{Bibleverse||Lev.|26}}. In {{Bibleverse-nb|1|Esdras|5:52}}, [[Joshua the High Priest]] and [[Zerubbabel]] lead the rededication of the altar for Sabbath, new moon, and (annual) holy feasts.
*[[1 Maccabees]]: In {{Bibleverse-nb|1|Maccabees|1:39-45}}, under [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]], Jerusalem's Sabbaths become a reproach and profanation. In {{Bibleverse-nb|1|Maccabees|2:32-41}}, he wars against the [[Maccabees]] and followers on Sabbath, one thousand of whom are killed after refusing to come out; [[Mattathias]] and his friends decree they will battle on Sabbath in [[self-defense]]. In 9:34-49, [[Bacchides (general)|Bacchides]] prepares to attack on Sabbath but is defeated by [[Jonathan Maccabeus]]. In 10:34, [[Demetrius I Soter]] declares that Jews will be free to celebrate feasts, Sabbaths, new moons, and solemn days, but is not received.
*[[2 Maccabees]]: In {{Bibleverse-nb|2|Maccabees|5:25-26}}, a [[Mysian]] captain named Apollonius attacks all those celebrating Sabbath. In {{Bibleverse-nb|2|Maccabees|6:6-11}}, Antiochus criminalizes Sabbath and ancient fasts, and those keeping Sabbath secretly in caves are burned to death. In {{Bibleverse-nb|2|Maccabees|8:26-28}}, after defeating [[Nicanor (Seleucid general)|Nicanor]]'s army, the men of [[Judas Maccabeus]] leave off pursuit on Preparation Day, instead gathering spoil, occupying themselves about Sabbath, and praising and thanking God; after Sabbath they distribute the spoil to the maimed, widows, and orphans, and then themselves and their servants. In {{Bibleverse-nb|2|Maccabees|12:38-39}}, Judas's men reach [[Adullam]] and purify themselves when the seventh day comes, according to custom, and keep Sabbath there, burying those dead in battle on the day after, according to custom (i.e., the first day). In {{Bibleverse-nb|2|Maccabees|15:1-4}}, Nicanor resolves to attack Judas in [[Samaria]] on Sabbath but is entreated to forbear by the Jews accompanying him, who argue that the living Lord commanded the seventh day to be kept in holiness.
*[[Judith]]: In {{Bibleverse-nb||Judith|8:6}}, Judith fasts and lives in a tent for three years and four months, except for Sabbath eve, Sabbath, new moon eve, new moon, and feasts and solemn days. In {{Bibleverse-nb||Judith|10:2}}, it is repeated that she only dwelt in her house for Sabbath and feast days.

==Religious books not from biblical canon==
*[[Infancy Gospel of Thomas]] 2.1-5: The five-year-old Jesus forms twelve sparrows out of clay on Sabbath, which then fly away, chirping; he also gathers together flowing water into pure pools by his word at the same time, and pronounces an efficaceous curse on the child who disperses the pools. Jews object to Joseph about these things.
*[[Gospel of Thomas]] 27: Jesus warns, "Fast as regards the world ... Observe the Sabbath as a Sabbath."
*[[Gospel of Peter]] 2.5, 7.27: Herod commends the swift burial of Jesus because it is the day before Sabbath and the [[Feast of Unleavened Bread]]. That day, after the ninth hour (3:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.), the disciples mourn and weep "night and day until the Sabbath" (sunset or 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.; the idiom "night and day" can import a portion of a day).
*[[Gospel of Nicodemus]] (Acts of Pilate) 1.1, 2.6, 4.2, 6.1, 12.1-2, 15.6, 16.1-2: Annas, Caiaphas, and others accuse Jesus of polluting Sabbath and wanting to [[Antinomianism|destroy Torah]], because he healed on Sabbath. Joseph of Arimathea is arrested and sealed up in a room on the day of Jesus' death, the day before Sabbath; he is ordered by a council to be dishonored on the day after Sabbath, but is not found when the door is opened. Joseph later testifies (on the day before another Sabbath) that he had remained locked up all Sabbath but, on midnight the day after, beheld a lightning flash and was led outside by the risen Jesus.
*[[Acts of Paul]], in the latter half of the second century: Paul prays "on the Sabbath as the Lord's Day [''kyriake''] drew near."
*[[Damascus Document]], known from the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] monastic community, as well as a previously found copy, contains some of the most detailed Sabbath regulations anywhere: Sabbath is said to begin from when the setting sun "is above the horizon by its diameter"; any discussion of business or commerce on Sabbath is specifically forbidden, as is housecleaning, opening a container, or taking anything in or out of one's house; and the limit for walking outside one's city is set at 1000 [[cubit]]s, or 2000 cubits if following a herd animal. One may bathe and drink water directly from the river on Sabbath, but not fill a container with water. Also, it is permitted to rescue a human being who falls into a well on the Sabbath, but significantly, not permitted to rescue an animal from a well on the Sabbath.

==Frameworks==
[[File:ShabbatableS.jpg|160px|thumb|left|Table set for ''Shabbat'' eve.]]
Three primary interpretative frameworks exist, with many subcategories. Interpretation is complicated by the differing meanings attributed to unambiguous seventh-day Sabbath prior to the [[resurrection of Jesus]]; the ambiguity of events after the resurrection, including first-day and seventh-day events ({{Bibleverse||Acts|20:7}}, {{Bibleverse|1|Cor.|16:2}}, perhaps {{Bibleverse||Rev.|1:10}}; {{Bibleverse||Acts|1:12}}, {{Bibleverse-nb||Acts|13:13-45}}, {{Bibleverse-nb||Acts|15:19-29}}, {{Bibleverse-nb||Acts|16:13}}, {{Bibleverse-nb||Acts|17:2}}, and {{Bibleverse-nb||Acts|18:4}}); and several early Christian observances being attested as daily or on nonspecific days ({{Bibleverse||Mk.|2:1-2}}, {{Bibleverse||Lk.|19:47-20:1}}, {{Bibleverse||Acts|2:42-47}}). Early Christians also observed Jewish practices as a sect of Judaism ({{Bibleverse||Acts|3:1}}, {{Bibleverse-nb||Acts|5:27-42}}, {{Bibleverse-nb||Acts|21:18-26}}, {{Bibleverse-nb||Acts|24:5}}, {{Bibleverse-nb||Acts|24:14}}, {{Bibleverse-nb||Acts|28:22}}), and observed Tanakh feasts (Passover, {{Bibleverse||Acts|12:3-4}}, {{Bibleverse-nb||Acts|20:6}}, {{Bibleverse|1|Cor.|5:7-8}}, {{Bibleverse-nb|1|Cor.|15:20}}, {{Bibleverse||Jude|12}}; Pentecost, {{Bibleverse||Acts|2:1}}, {{Bibleverse-nb||Acts|18:21}}, {{Bibleverse-nb||Acts|20:16}}, {{Bibleverse|1|Cor.|16:8}}; Atonement, {{Bibleverse||Acts|27:9}}). Interpreters of each framework consider the high regard for the [[New Covenant]] described in {{Bibleverse||Jer.|31:31}} (cf. {{Bibleverse||Heb.|8:1-13}}) as supporting their Sabbath positions.

===Seventh day===
{{main|Shabbat|Sabbath in seventh-day churches}}
[[File:Havdal.jpg|right|thumb|Observing the Sabbath-closing ''[[havdalah]]'' ritual in 14th-century Spain.]]

At least two branches of Christianity keep a seventh-day Sabbath, though historically they are not derived one from the other: the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the [[Seventh-day Sabbatarians]]. Of different outlooks in some respects, they share others. Just as in the Jewish calendar, the Orthodox begin and end every ecclesial day at sunset, including the Sabbath. Both branches thus observe the Sabbath from what the civil calendar identifies as Friday sunset until Saturday sunset. Both identify the Sabbath with the day of rest established by God as stated in Genesis 2, a day to be kept holy. Both identify Jesus Christ as the Lord of the Sabbath, and acknowledge that he faithfully kept the Sabbath throughout his life on earth. Both accept the admonitions of [[Ignatius of Antioch|St. Ignatius]] on the keeping of the Sabbath.&lt;ref name=Ignatius /&gt;

====Seventh-day Sabbatarians====
Seventh-day Sabbatarians rest on the seventh Hebrew day. Jewish ''[[Shabbat]]'' is observed from sundown on [[Friday]] until the appearance of three stars in the sky on [[Saturday]] night; it is also observed by a minority of Christians. [[Activities prohibited on Shabbat|Thirty-nine activities prohibited on ''Shabbat'']] are listed in Tractate ''[[Shabbat (Talmud)|Shabbat]]'' ([[Talmud]]). Customarily, ''Shabbat'' is ushered in by lighting [[candle]]s shortly before sunset, at [[halakhic]]ally calculated times that change from week to week and from place to place. Observance in [[Hebrew Scriptures]] was universally from sixth-day evening to seventh-day evening ({{Bibleverse||Neh.|13:19|NIV}}, cf. {{Bibleverse||Lev.|23:32|NIV}}) on a [[seven-day week]]; ''Shabbat'' ends approximately one hour after sunset by rabbinical ordinance to extend the Tanakh's sunset-to-sunset Sabbath into the first day of the week. The Jewish interpretation usually states that the New Covenant ({{Bibleverse||Jer.|31:31}}) refers to the future Messianic Kingdom.

Several Christian denominations (such as [[Seventh Day Baptist]], [[Seventh-day Adventist]], [[Sabbath Rest Advent Church]], [[Church of God (Seventh Day)]], and other [[Church of God (disambiguation)|Churches of God]]) observe Sabbath similarly to or less rigorously than Judaism, but observance ends at Saturday sunset instead of Saturday nightfall. Like the Jews with ''Shabbat'', they believe that keeping [[seventh-day Sabbath]] is a moral responsibility, equal to that of any of the [[Ten Commandments]], that honors God as Creator and Deliverer. The Christian seventh-day interpretation usually states that Sabbath belongs inherently to all nations ({{Bibleverse||Ex.|20:10}}, {{Bibleverse||Is.|56:6-7}}, {{Bibleverse-nb||Is.|66:22-23}}) and remains part of the New Covenant after the [[crucifixion of Jesus]] ({{Bibleverse||Lk.|23:56}}, {{Bibleverse||Mt.|24:20}}, {{Bibleverse||Acts|16:13}}, {{Bibleverse||Heb.|8:10}}).&lt;ref name=wohlberg&gt;{{cite web|title=Sabbath Basics|author=Wohlberg, Steve|url=http://www.whitehorsemedia.com/articles/?d=81}} {{cite book|title=Truth Left Behind|chapter=Ten Reasons why the Sabbath is ''not Jewish''|url=http://www.whitehorsemedia.com/articles/?d=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.sabbathtruth.com/faq/advanced-topics/the-lost-day-of-history.aspx|title=The Lost Day Of History|chapter=8. But wasn't the Sabbath changed to Sunday at Christ's death or resurrection?|publisher=Amazing Facts|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many seventh-day Sabbatarians also use "[[Lord's Day]]" to mean the seventh day, based on Scriptures in which God calls the day "my Sabbath" ({{Bibleverse||Ex.|31:13|NIV}}) and "to the {{LORD}}" ({{Bibleverse-nb||Ex.|16:23|NIV}}); some count Sunday separately as Lord's Day and many consider it appropriate for communal worship (but not for first-day rest, which would be considered breaking the Ten Commandments&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anti-Sabbath Arguments: Are They Really Right?|author=Wohlberg, Steve|url=http://www.whitehorsemedia.com/articles/?d=81|work=Truth Left Behind}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

In this way, St. Ignatius saw believers "no longer observing the [Jewish] Sabbath, but living in the observance of the Lord's Day", and amplified this point as follows: "Let us therefore no longer keep the Sabbath after the Jewish manner, and rejoice in days of idleness .... But let every one of you keep the Sabbath after a spiritual manner, rejoicing in meditation on the law, not in relaxation of the body, admiring the workmanship of God, and not eating things prepared the day before, nor using lukewarm drinks, and walking within a prescribed space, nor finding delight in dancing and plaudits which have no sense in them. And after the observance of the Sabbath, let every friend of Christ keep the Lord's Day as a festival, the resurrection-day, the queen and chief of all the days."&lt;ref name=Ignatius&gt;{{cite journal|author=St. Ignatius|author-link=Ignatius of Antioch|title=Epistle to the Magnesians|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.v.iii.ix.html|volume=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Seventh-day Adventist]] official 28 fundamental beliefs (at 20) state:&lt;blockquote&gt;The beneficent Creator, after the six days of Creation, rested on the seventh day and instituted the Sabbath for all people as a memorial of Creation. The fourth commandment of God's unchangeable law requires the observance of this seventh-day Sabbath as the day of rest, worship, and ministry in harmony with the teaching and practice of Jesus, the Lord of the Sabbath. The Sabbath is a day of delightful communion with God and one another. It is a symbol of our redemption in Christ, a sign of our sanctification, a token of our allegiance, and a foretaste of our eternal future in God's kingdom. The Sabbath is God's perpetual sign of His eternal covenant between Him and His people. Joyful observance of this holy time from evening to evening, sunset to sunset, is a celebration of God's creative and redemptive acts. (Gen. 2:1-3; Ex. 20:8-11; Luke 4:16; Isa. 56:5, 6; 58:13, 14; Matt. 12:1-12; Ex. 31:13-17; Eze. 20:12, 20; Deut. 5:12-15; Heb. 4:1-11; Lev. 23:32; Mark 1:32.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.adventist.org/beliefs/fundamental/index.html|title=Fundamental Beliefs|volume=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Doctrinal Points of the [[Church of God (7th day)]] (Salem Conference, at 17) state:&lt;blockquote&gt;We should observe the seventh day of the week (Saturday), from even to even, as the Sabbath of the Lord our God. Evening is at sunset when day ends and another day begins. No other day has ever been sanctified as the day of rest. The Sabbath Day begins at sundown on Friday and ends at sundown on Saturday. Genesis 2:1-3; Exodus 20:8-11; Isaiah 58:13-14; 56:1-8; Acts 17:2; Acts 18:4, 11; Luke 4:16; Mark 2:27-28; Matthew 12:10-12; Hebrews 4:1-11; Genesis 1:5, 13-14; Nehemiah 13:19.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.churchofgod-7thday.org/Publications/Doctrinal%20Points%20Final%20Proof.pdf|title=Doctrinal Points of the Church of God (7th Day)|location=[[Salem, West Virginia]]|page=18|publisher=The Church of God Publishing House}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Both Jewish and Christian seventh-day interpretation usually state that Jesus' teachings relate to the Pharisaic position on Sabbath observance, and that Jesus kept seventh-day Sabbath throughout his life on earth.

=====Sunday law=====
{{main|Seventh-day Adventist eschatology}}
Noticing the rise of [[blue law]]s, the [[Seventh-day Adventist]] church in particular has traditionally taught that in the [[end time]] a coalition of religious and secular authorities will enforce an international Sunday law; church pioneers saw observance of [[seventh-day Sabbath]] as a "mark" or "seal" or test of God's people that seals them, even as those who do not observe Sunday rest will be persecuted and killed. [[Ellen G. White]] interpreted {{Bibleverse||Dan.|7:25}}, {{Bibleverse||Rev.|13:15}}, {{Bibleverse||Rev.|7}}, {{Bibleverse||Ezek.|20:12-20}}, and {{Bibleverse||Ex.|31:13}} in this way, describing the subject of persecution in prophecy as being about Sabbath commandments.

===First day===
{{main|Sabbath in Christianity|Sabbatarianism#Sunday Sabbatarians}}
Most Christians worship communally on the first (Hebrew or Roman) day. In most Christian denominations ([[Roman Catholic]], some{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} [[Eastern Orthodox]], and most [[Protestant]]), the "[[Lord's Day]]" ([[Sunday]]) is the fulfillment of the "[[Sabbath in Christianity|Sabbath]]" (Catholic Catechism 2175), which is kept in commemoration of the [[resurrection of Christ]], and often celebrated with the [[Eucharist]] (Catholic Catechism 2177).&lt;ref name=ccc/&gt; It is often also the day of [[leisure|rest]]. Lord's Day is considered both the first day and the [[The eighth day (Christian)|"eighth day"]] of the [[seven-day week]], symbolizing both first creation and new creation (2174).&lt;ref name=ccc&gt;{{cite book|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church|edition=2d|publisher=[[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]|location=[[New York City]]|year=1997|author=United States Catholic Conference, Inc.|chapter=You Shall Love the Lord Your God with All Your Heart, and with All Your Soul, and with All Your Mind, Article 3, The Third Commandment (2168-2195)|pages=580–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Alternatively, in some calendars, Sunday is designated the seventh day of the week.) Relatively few Christians regard first-day observance as entailing all of the ordinances of ''Shabbat''. This interpretation usually states that the Holy Spirit through the Apostles instituted the worship celebration of the first day to commemorate Jesus' resurrection, and that the New Covenant transfers Sabbath-keeping (whether defined as rest or communal worship or both) to the first day by implication.&lt;ref&gt;James Cardinal Gibbons, The Faith of Our Fathers (1917 edition), p. 72-73 (16th Edition, p. 111; 88th Edition, p. 89). "You may read the Bible from Genesis to Revelation, and you will not find a single line authorizing the sanctification of Sunday. The Scriptures enforce the religious observance of Saturday, a day which we never sanctify."&lt;/ref&gt; In Roman Catholicism, the transfer is described as based on their church's authority and [[papal infallibility]].&lt;ref&gt;Catholic Virginian, October 3, 1947, p. 9, article "To Tell You the Truth." "For example, nowhere in the Bible do we find that Christ or the Apostles ordered that the Sabbath be changed from Saturday to Sunday. We have the commandment of God given to Moses to keep holy the Sabbath day, that is the 7th day of the week, Saturday. Today most Christians keep Sunday because it has been revealed to us by the [Roman Catholic] church outside the Bible."&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman Catholics (and many Protestants) view the first day as a day for assembly for worship (2178, {{Bibleverse||Heb.|10:25}}),&lt;ref name=ccc/&gt; but consider a day of rigorous rest not obligatory on Christians ({{Bibleverse||Rom.|14:5}}, {{Bibleverse||Col.|2:16}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sabbath|work=The Catholic Encyclopedia|date=1913|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13287b.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catholics count the prohibition of servile work as transferred from seventh-day Sabbath to Sunday (2175-6),&lt;ref name=ccc/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ten Commandments|work=The Catholic Encyclopedia|date=1913|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13287a.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; but do not hinder participation in "ordinary and innocent occupations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sabbatarians|work=The Catholic Encyclopedia|date=1913|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13287a.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, second-century father [[Justin Martyr]] believed in keeping perpetual Sabbath by repentance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Justin Martyr|author-link=Justin Martyr|title=Dialogue with Trypho|volume=12|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.viii.iv.xii.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; holding that Gentile Christians need not rest as Jews were commanded;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Justin Martyr|author-link=Justin Martyr|title=Dialogue with Trypho|volume=23|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.viii.iv.xxiii.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he accepted extant non-Judaizing seventh-day Sabbatarian Christians "in all things as kinsmen and brethren".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Justin Martyr|author-link=Justin Martyr|title=Dialogue with Trypho|volume=47|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.viii.iv.xlvii.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other Protestant denominations, Lord's Day is kept as a rest day with similar rigor as [[Jewish Sabbath]]. The [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] 21:7-8, a [[Reformed]] Sabbatarian creed, states:&lt;blockquote&gt;As it is the law of nature, that, in general, a due proportion of time be set apart for the worship of God; so, in His Word, by a positive, moral, and perpetual commandment binding all men in all ages, He has particularly appointed one day in seven, for a Sabbath, to be kept holy unto him (Ex. 20:8, 20:10-11, Is. 56:2, 56:4, 56:6-7): which, from the beginning of the world to the resurrection of Christ, was the last day of the week: and, from the resurrection of Christ, was changed into the first day of the week (Ge. 2:2-3, 1 Cor. 16:1-2, Ac. 20:7), which, in Scripture, is called the Lord's Day (Rev. 1:10), and is to be continued to the end of the world, as the Christian Sabbath (Ex. 20:8, 20:10, Mt. 5:17). This Sabbath is to be kept holy unto the Lord when men, after a due preparing of their hearts, and ordering of their common affairs beforehand, do not only observe an holy rest all the day from their own works, words, and thoughts about their worldly employments and recreations (Ex. 20:8, 16:23, 16:25-26, 16:29-30, 31:15-17, Is. 58:13, Neh. 13:15-19, 13:21-22), but also are taken up the whole time in the public and private exercises of His worship, and in the duties of necessity and mercy (Is. 58:13).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.reformed.org/documents/wcf_with_proofs/|title=Westminster Confession of Faith|volume=21.7-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Likewise, the General Rules of the Methodist Church required "attending upon all the ordinances of God" including "the public worship of God" and prohibited "profaning the day of the Lord, either by doing ordinary work therein or by buying or selling".&lt;ref name="Tucker2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tucker|first=Karen B. Westerfield|title=American Methodist Worship|date=27 April 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=English |isbn=9780199774159|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Assemblies====
{{main|Lord's Day}}
The following textual evidence for first-day assembly is usually combined with the notion that the rest day should follow the assembly day to support first-day Sabbatarianism. On the first day of the week (usually considered the day of [[First Fruits#Biblical|Firstfruits]]), after Jesus has been raised from the dead ({{Bibleverse||Mk.|16:9|NIV}}), he appears to [[Mary Magdalene]], [[Saint Peter|Peter]], [[Cleopas]], and others. "On the evening of that first day of the week" (Roman time), or the evening beginning the second day (Hebrew time), the resurrected Jesus appears at a meeting of ten apostles and other disciples ({{Bibleverse||Jn.|20:19|NIV}}). The same time of the week "a week later" (NIV) or, more literally, "after eight days again" inclusive (KJV), Jesus appears to the eleven apostles and others ({{Bibleverse||Jn.|20:26}}). After Jesus ascends ({{Bibleverse||Acts|1:9}}), on the feast of [[Pentecost]] or [[Shavuot]] (the 50th day from Firstfruits and thus usually calculated as the first day of the week), the Spirit of God is given to the disciples, who baptize 3,000 people into the apostolic fellowship. Later, on one occasion in [[Troad|Troas]], the early Christians meet on the first day (Hebrew) to break bread and to listen to Christian preaching ({{Bibleverse||Acts|20:7}}). Paul also states that the churches of [[Corinth]] and [[Galatia]] should set aside donations on the first day for collection ({{Bibleverse|1|Cor.|16:2}}). [[Didache]] 14:1 (AD 70-120?) contains an ambiguous text, translated by Roberts as, "But every Lord's day gather yourselves together, and break bread, and give thanksgiving";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Didache|chapter=14:1|url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/didache-roberts.html|publisher=Early Christian Writings|others=Roberts, trans}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first clause in Greek, "[[wikt:κατά|κατά]] {{lang|grc|[[wikt:κυριακήν|κυριακήν]]}} [[wikt:δέ|δέ]] [[wikt:κύριος|κυρίου]]", literally means "On the Lord's of the Lord",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Holmes, M|title=The Apostolic Fathers: Greek Texts and English Translations}}&lt;/ref&gt; and translators supply the elided noun (e.g., "day", "commandment" (from 13:7), or "doctrine").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Strand, Kenneth A.|title=The Sabbath in Scripture and History|pages=347–8|location=[[Washington, D.C.]]|publisher=Review and Herald Publishing Association|date=1982}} In {{cite book|author=Morgan, Kevin|title=Sabbath Rest|pages=37–8|year=2002|publisher=TEACH Services, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gleason Archer]] regards this as clearly referring to Sunday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Archer|first=Gleason L|title=An Encyclopedia of Bible Difficulties|authorlink=Gleason Archer|page=114|url=http://www.tsbalan.com/books/Difficulties.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111202231015/http://www.tsbalan.com/books/Difficulties.pdf|archivedate=2011-12-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breaking bread may refer to [[communion (Christian)|Christian fellowship]], [[agape feast]]s, or [[Eucharist]] (cf. {{Bibleverse||Acts|2:42}}, {{Bibleverse-nb||Acts|20:7}}). Other interpreters believe these references do not support the concept of transfer of the seventh-day rest, and some add that they do not sufficiently prove that Sunday observance was an established practice in the primitive New Testament church.

By the second century, [[Justin Martyr]] stated, "We all gather on the day of the sun" (recalling both the creation of light and the resurrection);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Justin Martyr|author-link=Justin Martyr|title=First Apology|volume=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Epistle of Barnabas]] on {{Bibleverse||Is.|1:13}} stated the eighth-day assembly marks the resurrection and the new creation: "He is saying there: 'It is not these sabbaths of the present age that I find acceptable, but the one of my own appointment: the one that, after I have set all things at rest, is to usher in the Eighth Day, the commencement of a new world.' (And we too rejoice in celebrating the Eighth Day; because that was when Jesus rose from the dead, and showed Himself again, and ascended into heaven.)"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|others=Staniforth, Maxwell, trans|title=[[Epistle of Barnabas]]|volume=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Both days===
[[Ethiopian Orthodox]] and [[Eritrean Orthodox]] Christians (both of which are branches of [[Oriental Orthodoxy]]) distinguish between the Sabbath (seventh day) and Lord's Day (first day) and observe both. Seventh-day Adventists in several islands of the Pacific (Tonga; Western Samoa; Tokelau; Wallis &amp; Futuna; Phoenix &amp; Line Islands) observe Sunday as the practice on ships in the Pacific had been to change days at the 180° meridian. The islands were well to the east of this line, so the missionaries observed the Sabbath on the day sequence of the Western Hemisphere. However, the Tonga islands used the same days as New Zealand and Australia, so the missionaries were observing the seventh-day Sabbath on the day the secular authorities called Sunday.{{sfn|Hay|1990|p=4}}{{efn|Governments are free to select the time zone of their choice.}}

The [[International Date Line]] (IDL) was placed east of Tonga to align its weekdays with New Zealand and Fiji. 
Consequently, Tonga's [[time zone]] is UTC+13 rather than UTC−12:00, as it would be if the Date Line ran along the 180° meridian.{{sfn|Greene|2002|p=80}}
However, the SDA church observes the Sabbath as though the IDL followed the 180° meridian.

When the International Date Line was moved, islanders who had been worshiping on Sabbath were suddenly worshiping on Sunday because of a man made international treaty.  After much discussion within the church, it was decided that the islanders would continue to worship on the same day as they always had, even though the name of the day had been changed from Saturday to Sunday by decree.  However this situation is not without conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/samoa20sabbath/search/results.cfm?kw1=samoa%20sabbath&amp;kw2=&amp;st=gsa]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Note'': {{notelist}}

===Unspecified day===
{{main|Non-Sabbatarianism}}
[[Non-Sabbatarian]]s affirm human liberty not to observe a weekly rest or worship day. While keepers of weekly days usually believe in religious liberty,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Shabbat|author=Berkowitz, Richard &amp; Michele|publisher=Lederer Publications|location=[[Baltimore]]|date=1991|isbn=1-880226-00-6|pages=11–2|quote=We have a remembrance–a physical Sabbath day–to remind us anew of our spiritual freedom in him .... Observance paints a sacred picture of what it is like to be united in faith with Messiah Yeshua. One other reason to observe Shabbat is ''God has a blessing for us.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; non-Sabbatarians are particularly free to uphold Sabbath principles, or not, without limiting observance to either Saturday or Sunday. Some advocate Sabbath rest on any chosen day of the week, and some advocate Sabbath as a symbolic metaphor for rest in Christ; the concept of "Lord's Day" is usually treated as synonymous with "Sabbath". The non-Sabbatarian interpretation usually states that Jesus' obedience and the New Covenant fulfilled the laws of Sabbath, which are thus often considered abolished or abrogated.

Some of Jesus' teachings are considered as redefining the Sabbath laws of the Pharisees ({{Bibleverse||Lk.|13:10-17}}, {{Bibleverse||Jn.|5:16-18}}, {{Bibleverse-nb||Jn.|9:13-16}}). Since Jesus is understood to have fulfilled [[Torah]] ({{Bibleverse||Mk.|2:28}}, {{Bibleverse||Mt.|5:17}}), non-Sabbatarian Christians believe that they are not bound by Sabbath as [[legalism (theology)|legalists]] consider themselves to be. Non-Sabbatarians can thus exhibit either [[Christian liberty]] or [[antinomianism]]. On principles of religious liberty, non-Sabbatarian Jews similarly affirm their freedom not to observe ''Shabbat'' as [[Orthodox Jew]]s do.

Non-Sabbatarian Christians also cite {{Bibleverse|2|Cor.|3:2-3}}, in which believers are compared to "a letter from Christ, the result of our ministry, written ... not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts"; this interpretation states that Christians accordingly no longer follow the Ten Commandments with dead orthodoxy ("tablets of stone"), but follow a new law written upon "tablets of human hearts". {{Bibleverse-nb|2|Cor.|3:7-11}} adds that "if the ministry that brought death, which was engraved in letters on stone, came with glory ..., will not the ministry of the Spirit be even more glorious? .... And if what was fading away came with glory, how much greater is the glory of that which lasts!" This is interpreted as teaching that new-covenant Christians are not under the Mosaic law, and that Sabbath-keeping is not required. Further, because "love is the fulfillment of the law" ({{Bibleverse||Rom.|13:10}}), the new-covenant "law" is considered to be based entirely upon love and to rescind Sabbath requirements.

Non-Sabbatarians who affirm that Sabbath-keeping remains for God's people (as in {{Bibleverse||Heb.|4:9}}) often regard this as present spiritual rest and/or future heavenly rest rather than as physical weekly rest. For instance, Irenaeus saw Sabbath rest from secular affairs for one day each week as a sign of the way that Christians were called to permanently devote themselves to God&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Against Heresies|volume=3.16.1|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.ix.vi.xvii.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an eschatological symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Against Heresies|volume=4.33.2|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.ix.vii.xxxiv.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations==

===Genesis 2===
Based on Genesis 2:1-4, Sabbath is considered by seventh-day Sabbatarians to be the first holy day mentioned in the Bible, with God, Adam, and Eve being the first to observe it. In order to reconcile an [[omnipotent]] God with a resting on the seventh day of [[Genesis creation narrative|Creation]], the notion of active cessation from labor, rather than passive rest, has been regarded as a more consistent reading of God's activity in this passage. Non-Sabbatarians and many first-day Sabbatarians consider this passage not to have instituted observance of Sabbath, which they place as beginning with Moses and the manna. [[Walter Brueggemann]] emphasizes Sabbath is rooted in the history of the [[Book of Exodus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brueggemann|first=Walter|authorlink=Walter Brueggemann|title=The Land: Place as Gift, Promise, and Challenge in Biblical Faith|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gFQQAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=2011-09-28|edition=2d|year=2002|publisher=Fortress Press|isbn=978-0-8006-3462-9|series=Overtures to Biblical Theology|pages=60, 225|quote=The tradition of Deuteronomy appeals for Sabbath on more historical grounds. Sabbath is rooted in the history of Exodus, which led to the land of fulfillment.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Matthew 5===
Jesus' statement, "Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them," is highly debated. Some non-Sabbatarians and others such as [[Anabaptists]] believe Jesus greatly reformed the Law and thus that Sabbath could only be justified if it were reaffirmed by Jesus. [[Antinomianism]], generally regarded as a [[heresy]], holds that, because Jesus accomplished all that was required by the law, thus "fulfilling" it, he made it unnecessary for anyone to do anything further. Strict Sabbatarians follow or expand [[Augustine]]'s statement in ''Reply to Faustus'' that Jesus empowered his people to obey the law and gave additional commands that furthered its true intentions. This passage is often related to Colossians 2, from which maintenance, transference, or abolition of Sabbath are variously taught.

===Colossians 2===
The [[English Standard Version]] at {{Bibleverse||Col.|2:16-7}} ("Therefore let no one pass judgment on you in questions of food and drink, or with regard to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath. These are a shadow of the things to come, but the substance belongs to Christ.") is taken as affirming non-Sabbatarian freedom from obligations to Sabbath, whether this means only annual Sabbaths ({{Bibleverse||Lev.|23:4–44}})&lt;ref name=col2/&gt; or specifically weekly Sabbath ({{Bibleverse||Lev.|23:1–3}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote=The false teacher(s) were advocating a number of Jewish observances, arguing that they were essential for spiritual advancement .... The old covenant observances pointed to a future reality that was fulfilled in the Lord Jesus Christ (cf. Heb. 10:1). Hence, Christians are no longer under the Mosaic covenant (cf. Rom. 6:14–15; 7:1–6; 2 Cor. 3:4–18; Gal. 3:15–4:7). Christians are no longer obligated to observe OT dietary laws ('food and drink') or festivals, holidays, and special days ('a festival ... new moon ... Sabbath,' Col. 2:16), for what these things foreshadowed has been fulfilled in Christ. It is debated whether the Sabbaths in question included the regular seventh-day rest of the fourth commandment, or were only the special Sabbaths of the Jewish festal calendar.|title=[[Holy Bible]], [[English Standard Version]]|chapter=Notes on Col. 2:16-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This passage's threefold categorization of events is parallel to {{Bibleverse||Num.|28-29}}, {{Bibleverse|1|Chr.|23:31}}, {{Bibleverse|2|Chr.|2:4}}, {{Bibleverse||Is.|1:13}}, {{Bibleverse||Ezek.|45:17}} ({{Bibleverse||Lev.|23}} mentions Sabbaths and festivals but not new moons). Accordingly, non-Sabbatarians and some first-day Sabbatarians believe this passage indicates Sabbath-keeping is part of an [[Old Covenant]] that is not mandatory (cf. {{Bibleverse||Heb.|8:13}}). Seventh-day Sabbatarians and strict first-day Sabbatarians believe this passage indicates that weekly Sabbath remains to be kept as a shadow of things future to Paul's day&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jewish New Testament Commentary|author=Stern, David H.|date=1992|publisher=Jewish New Testament Publications, Inc.|location=[[Clarksville, Maryland]]|isbn=965-359-008-1|page=611|chapter=Notes on Col. 2:17|quote='''These are a shadow of things that are coming''', meaning the good things that will happen when [[Jesus|Yeshua]] returns.}} Both verbs in 17a are present tense.&lt;/ref&gt; and/or a memorial of creation past.&lt;ref name=col2&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.sabbathtruth.com/faq/frequently-asked-questions/articletype/articleview/articleid/929/please-explain-colossians-214.aspx|chapter=Please explain Colossians 2:14|title=The Law and the Sabbath|author=Walker, Allen|pages=113–116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, {{Bibleverse||Col.|2:13-5}} states, "And you, who were dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses, by canceling the record of debt that stood against us with its legal demands. This he set aside, nailing it to the cross. He disarmed the rulers and authorities and put them to open shame, by triumphing over them in him." The ESV footnote regards "''in it'' (that is, the [[Christian cross|cross]])" as equivalent to the closing ''in him'' ([[Christ]]). First-day Sabbatarians and non-Sabbatarians often regard Sabbath as changed, either to Lord's Day or to spiritual Sabbath, by the Mosaic law being the "record of debt" (ESV) nailed to the cross. Some seventh-day Sabbatarians regard only High Sabbaths as abolished due to their foreshadowing the cross, holding it impossible for weekly Sabbath (which preceded sin) to foreshadow deliverance from sin in the cross.&lt;ref name=lostday6/&gt; Others see the "record of debt" (accusations) as distinct from God's unchanging law, believing it to be in force and affirmed by the evangelists after Jesus died on the cross,&lt;ref name=wohlberg/&gt; regarding Sabbath, new moon, and High Sabbaths not as nailed to the cross but as foreshadowing the eternal plan of God.&lt;ref name=howard/&gt;

===Hebrews 4===
The [[hapax legomenon|unique word]] ''sabbatismos'' in Hebrews 4:9 is translated "rest" in the [[Authorized Version]] and others; "Sabbath rest" in the [[New International Version]] and other modern translations; "Sabbatism" (a [[transliteration]]) in the [[Darby Bible]]; "Sabbath observance" in the [[Scriptures 98 Edition]]; and "Sabbath keeping" in the [[Bible in Basic English]]. The word also appears in [[Plutarch]], ''De Superstitione'' 3 (Moralia 166A); [[Justin Martyr|Justin]], ''Dialogue with Trypho'' 23:3; [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]], ''[[Panarion|Adversus Haereses]]'' 30:2:2; ''Martyrium Petri et Pauli'' 1; and ''[[Apostolic Constitutions]]'' 2:36:2. [[Andrew T. Lincoln|Andrew Lincoln]] states, "In each of these places the term denotes the observance or celebration of the Sabbath .... Thus the writer to the Hebrews is saying that since the time of Joshua an observance of the Sabbath rest has been outstanding."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lincoln, Prof. Andrew T|author-link=Andrew T. Lincoln|title=From Sabbath to Lord's Day (symposium)|page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sabbatarians believe the primary abiding Christian duty intended is weekly Sabbath-keeping, while non-Sabbatarians believe it is spiritual or eschatological Sabbath-keeping; both meanings may be intended. Justin uses ''sabbatismos'' in ''Trypho'' 23:3 to mean weekly Sabbath-keeping.

However, Justin does not speak of Hebrews 4, instead holding that there is no longer any need for weekly Sabbath-keeping for anyone. [[Hippolytus of Rome]], in the early third century, interpreted the term in Hebrews 4 to have special reference to a [[millennialism|millennial]] Sabbath kingdom after six millennia of labor. [[St. Chrysostom]] interpreted the term as having reference to three rests: God's rest from His labor on the seventh day, the rest of the Israelites in arriving in Canaan, and the heavenly (eschatological) rest for the faithful. He argued that the "rest" that "has been outstanding" is the heavenly rest, since the first two rests had already been going on. He also interpreted weekly Sabbath as a symbol of this heavenly rest: "And well did he conclude the argument. For he said not rest but 'Sabbath-keeping'; calling the kingdom 'Sabbath-keeping,' by the appropriate name, and that which they rejoiced in and were attracted by. For as, on the Sabbath He commands to abstain from all evil things; and that those things only which relate to the Service of God should be done, which things the Priests were wont to accomplish, and whatsoever profits the soul, and nothing else; so also [will it be] then."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Chrysostom|author-link=John Chrysostom|title=6th Homily on the Epistle to the Hebrews|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf114.v.x.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Matthew Henry]] calls this "a rest of grace, and comfort, and holiness, in the gospel state. And a rest in glory, where the people of God shall enjoy the end of their faith, and the object of all their desires .... undoubtedly the heavenly rest, which remains to the people of God, and is opposed to a state of labour and trouble in this world. It is the rest they shall obtain when the Lord Jesus shall appear from heaven .... God has always declared man's rest to be in him, and his love to be the only real happiness of the soul."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Matthew Henry|Henry, Matthew]]|title=Concise Commentary on the Whole Bible}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is taken to support the belief that Sabbath-keeping is a metaphor for the eternal "rest" that Christians enjoy in Christ, prefigured by the promised land of Canaan.

===Hebrews 8===
Non-Sabbatarians and some first-day Sabbatarians believe Hebrews 8 indicates Sabbath-keeping is not mandatory, because "in that he saith, a new covenant, he hath made the first old" ({{Bibleverse||Heb.|8:13}} KJV; or "obsolete" NIV). Seventh-day Sabbatarians and strict first-day Sabbatarians believe Hebrews 8 indicates the Law of God (including Sabbath) remains on the hearts of God's people to be kept, but not fallibly as in the older covenant ({{Bibleverse||Heb.|8:9–10}}).

A '''botánica''' (often written '''botanica''' and less commonly known as a '''hierbería''' or '''botica''') is a [[Retailing|retail store]] that sells [[folk medicine]], [[religious]] [[candle]]s and [[statuary]], [[amulet]]s, and other products regarded as [[Magic (paranormal)|magical]] or as [[alternative medicine]].  They also carry [[oil]]s, [[incense]], [[perfume]]s, scented [[Aerosol spray|spray]]s (many of which are thought to have special properties) and various [[brand name]] health care products.&lt;ref name="Uic"&gt;[http://homepages.stmartin.edu/fac_staff/agomez/Botanica/actual%20article.pdf "The Botánica as a Culturally Appropriate Health Care Option for Latinos"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070316231456/http://homepages.stmartin.edu/fac_staff/agomez/Botanica/actual%20article.pdf |date=2007-03-16 }} by Alfredo Gomez-Beloz Ph.D., M.P.H.,1 and Noel Chavez Ph.D., R.D., L.D.2, ''The Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine'' Vol. 7, No. 5, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

These stores are common in many [[Hispanic America]]n countries and communities of [[Latino]] people elsewhere.  As such:&lt;blockquote&gt;
Botánicas now can be found in any United States city that has a sizable Latino/a population, particularly those with ties to the Caribbean. The number of botánicas found outside of New York and [[Miami]] has grown tremendously in the last ten years.&lt;ref name="nor"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

The name ''botánica'' is Spanish and [[translation|translates]] as "botany" or "plant" store, referring  to these establishments' function as dispensaries of medicinal
herbs. Medicinal herbs may be sold dried or fresh, prepackaged or in bulk.&lt;ref name="Uic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sim"&gt;Similar stores in Brazil and the [[French Caribbean]] are called by different terms [[cognate]] with "botánica" and "hierbería".  All these businesses have some parallels with shops specializing in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] and similar practices from outsides the Americas.  The specifics, however, are very different.&lt;/ref&gt;

Botánica almost always feature a variety of products used in [[Roman Catholic]] religious practice such as [[rosary beads]], [[holy water]], and images of [[Portal:Saints|saints]].  Among the latter, the [[Virgin of Guadalupe]] and other devotional figures with a Latin American connection are especially well represented. The Catholic Church allows herbal medicine but prohibits magic and other religions. However, most botánica have products associated with other spiritual practices such as [[candomblé]], [[curanderismo]], [[espiritismo]], [[macumba]] and [[santería]].&lt;ref name="Uic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="harvard"&gt;[http://www.monroecc.edu/depts/sociology/pluralism/profile32.htm Botanica Obatala y Shango (Profile No.2)], Research conducted by Aylen Fonseca, Monroe Community College / Harvard Pluralism Project&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternative medical treatments found in botánicas are used to treat such varied conditions as [[arthritis]], [[asthma]], [[hair loss]], [[Menstruation|menstrual]] [[pain]] and [[diabetes]].  There are also products that are designed to attract love, bring good luck and financial prosperity, deflect jealousy and so on.&lt;ref name="Uic"/&gt;

According to researchers at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Most Latin American (Latino) immigrants to the United States participate in the dominant health care system. [...] Oftentimes, while utilizing this health care system, they continue to use their own culturally appropriate health care practices [...] In curanderismo, santería, and espiritismo, the practitioners assess the patient and, depending on [[diagnosis]], prepares a healing remedy or a variety of healing remedies. A remedy is any combination of medicinal herbs, religious amulets, and/or other products used for the prevention, treatment, or palliation of folk and [[Wiktionary:somatic|somatic]] illnesses. It is usually administered by the practitioner and may involve several sessions. In other cases, a [[curandero]], espiritista, or santero will provide his/her client with a list of herbs and/or religious amulets needed for the remedy. The client will go to the botánica with this "shopping list," purchase the product(s), and return to the healer for preparation and administration of the remedy. If the remedy is to be administered over a long period of time, he/she may be instructed to administer the remedy at home.&lt;ref name="Uic"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:Botanica store close up.JPG|right|333px|right|thumb|botanica shelf]]

Besides being merely a place to obtain goods, "Botánicas serve as unique sites for the performance of religious culture. … Botánicas create a highly visible cultural gathering place in the public sphere."&lt;ref name="nor"&gt;[http://hemi.nyu.edu/por/seminar/peru/call/workgroups/popperf2enordt.shtml "Botánicas: Globalization of Religion through Commodity"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060911174537/http://hemi.nyu.edu/por/seminar/peru/call/workgroups/popperf2enordt.shtml |date=September 11, 2006 }} [[New York University]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, stores without a direct connection to Latin American spiritual and alternative medical practices, such as a shop catering to the practice of [[West African Vodun|Vodou]] or to [[New Age]] beliefs, will use the term botánica as well.&lt;ref name="nor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sim"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wintersteel.com/SAGlassman.html An example in [[New Orleans]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddhism does not teach racism or equivalent forms of discrimination. However, in the modern era, instances of racism within Buddhist movement have been observed.&lt;ref name="Cheah2011p4"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Cheah|title=Race and Religion in American Buddhism: White Supremacy and Immigrant Adaptation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m95oAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-984315-2|pages=4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhist texts on discrimination== 

In many Buddhist texts places emphasis on a person's deeds and qualities instead of status by birth. Majhima Nikaya 98:650 says:{{cn|date=December 2016}}

'''Buddhism in Khotan''' comprised bodies of [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] religious doctrine and institutions characteristic of the Iranic [[Kingdom of Khotan]] as well as much of Western [[China]] and [[Tajikistan]]. It was the [[state religion]] of the [[Kingdom of Khotan]] until its collapse in 1000.&lt;ref name=Puri&gt;
{{cite book
  |last=Puri|first=Baij Nath
  |year=1987
  |title=Buddhism in Central Asia
  |publisher=Delhi Motilal Banarsidass
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by [[Mahayana Buddhism]], the kingdom’s vast collection of texts, which included the indigenous ''Book of Zambasta'' and a Khotanese translation of the ''[[Sanghata Sutra]]'' (the earliest translation of the Sanskrit text to date), helped Khotan influence the Buddhist practices of its neighbors, most notably [[Tibet]].

==History==
Local legend suggests that one of the Indian Emperor [[Ashoka|Ashoka's]] sons, Kushtana Maurya&lt;ref name=Bihar&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sinha|first1=Bindeshwari Prasad|title=Comprehensive history of Bihar|date=1974|publisher=Kashi Prasad Jayaswal Research Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;, founded the Central Asian city of Khotan, once the capital of a prominent Buddhist kingdom alongside the famous Silk Road.  According to this same legend, Ashoka’s son was abandoned by his father and nurtured by the Earth, with the ground swelling in the shape of a female breast. For this reason the child was named "Earth’s Breast", or Go-stana.  As he grew up, settlers from the Indian subcontinent and China began to settle within the oasis surrounding the “Earth’s breast.”   Together with an unnamed son of the Chinese emperor, the son of Ashoka helped Indian expatriates settle within the region and found a city named after the son, called Khotan.&lt;ref name=Brough&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|334}}  Even so, the Chinese pilgrim [[Xuanzang]] and Tibetan records both suggest that Buddhism would not be introduced to the kingdom until Go-stana's grandson Vijayasambhava was born 170 years after the city’s establishment.&lt;ref name=Rockhill&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|234}}  In Vijayasambhava’s fifth year of life, according to Xuanzang, a [[Kashmir]]i missionary named Vairocana arrived in Khotan and practiced meditations in the woods.  Gaining the people’s interest, he became a spiritual teacher for the Khotanese people and established the first Buddhist convent in Khotan.  His contributions helped introduce Vijayasambhava to the concepts of Buddhism, thus founding the Vijaya dynasty within Khotan and ultimately laying the foundations for the Buddhist faith to become its official religion by 130 BCE.&lt;ref name=Stein&gt;{{cite book

However, an account by the Han general [[Ban Chao]] suggested that the people of Khotan in 73 AD still appeared to practice [[Mazdeism]] or Shamanism&lt;ref name="tremblay"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kr_M1e7yImoC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;lpg=PA100#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= The Spread of Buddhism |editors= Ann Heirman, Stephan Peter Bumbacher |author=Xavier Tremblay }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ma yong"/&gt; His son [[Ban Yong]] who spent time in the [[Western Regions]] also did not mention Buddhism there, and with the absence of Buddhist art in the region before the beginning of [[Eastern Han]], it has been suggested that Buddhism may not have been adopted in the region until the middle of the second century AD.&lt;ref name="ma yong"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DguGWP0vGY8C&amp;pg=PA238#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=History of Civilizations of Central Asia: The Development of Sedentary  and Nomadic Civilisations: Vol 2 |editor= Janos Harmatta |authors=Ma Yong, Sun Yutang |page=237–238|isbn=978-8120814080 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A thriving Silk Road center of trade, the Kingdom of Khotan quickly established trade, diplomatic and religious relationships with its neighbors, most notably with [[Ancient China]].   While Khotan’s relations with the Chinese were initially not smooth due to an ill-fated revolt that killed a Chinese commander in the 2nd century, the Khotanese sent embassies to the [[Three Kingdoms Period|Three Kingdoms]] between 202 and 222 CE.  This led to the formation of close relations with the [[Jin Dynasty (265–420)|Jin Dynasty]] throughout the fifth and sixth centuries.&lt;ref name=Puri/&gt;{{rp|56}} Because of Khotan’s expansion and relations with its neighbors, its culture and its interpretations of Buddhism became a melting pot of all the cultures that existed along the Silk Road.

By 665 CE., the Tibetan army had conquered the city of Khotan.&lt;ref name=Konow&gt;
{{cite journal
  |last=Konow|first=Sten

  |title=Khotan Studies
  |journal=Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland
}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|348}} Ironically, while the Tibetans occupied the Khotanese kingdom, it was the Khotanese who influenced the Tibetans.  This was most notable in the cases of the technical vocabulary and the translation techniques used for Buddhist texts.   Much like the modern-day [[Tibetan alphabet]], the Khotanese alphabet utilized [[Gupta script|a Cursive Gupta script]], most likely influenced by [[Sanskrit]] from its nearby neighbors.  While writing down a translation of a Sanskrit work, Khotanese scribes would render Buddhist technical vocabulary though an etymology of each syllable.&lt;ref name=Hoernle&gt;

  |accessdate=12 July 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This helped the Khotanese maintain the accuracy of their translations, even if they were more concise than the Sanskrit and [[Pali]] originals.  The Tibetans had long sought to translate Buddhist Sanskrit texts in a more efficient matter, because at that time they did not share a common alphabet.  The occupation of the Central Asian kingdom however gave Tibetans an opportunity to learn the Khotanese alphabet.  By the 9th Century, the Tibetans had adapted the Khotanese alphabet for their language.&lt;ref&gt;

While [[Islam]] had earlier been introduced into Central Asia, it was not until 982 C.E. when the Islamic [[Kara-Khanid Khanate]] of [[Kashgar]] began to invade the Kingdom of Khotan.&lt;ref name=Berzin&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the time the city of Khotan fell to the Karakhanids in 1006 AD, most of the residual monks had already fled to Tibet, taking many of their sacred texts with them.  Not long after the Karakhanids began their occupation, Islam became the dominant religion in Khotan, marking an end of Buddhism in the region.

===Monastic Life===
Monastic communities stood as a key component within Khotanese Buddhist culture.  An example of this importance was noted by Chinese pilgrim [[Faxian]], who wrote about his four-month stay within the Kingdom. En route to [[India]] and [[Sri Lanka]] to obtain Buddhist scriptures, Faxian quickly found that the capital city’s monasteries made plenty of room for monks who traveled across the Silk Road.  He also found that the monasteries provided provisions necessary for him to continue his pilgrimage.  Within the walls of Gomati (a monastery within Khotan), he took special note of the silent, disciplined lifestyle within the monasteries: “When [the monks] enter the refectory, their demeanour is marked by a reverent gravity, and they take their seats in regular order, all maintaining a perfect silence.  No sound is heard from their alms-bowls and other utensils.  When any of these pure men require food, they are not allowed to call out (to the attendants) for it, but only make signs with their hands.” &lt;ref name=Faxian&gt;

While the Gomati and Gosirsa monasteries remain the most well known thanks to their documentation by the famous Chinese pilgrims Faxian and Xuanzang, the kingdom was once home to over a hundred monasteries, accommodating more than five thousand monks.&lt;ref name=Wriggins&gt;

Another temple that helped define Khotanese Buddhist traditions was Tuopulukedun, an area that holds one of the best preserved Buddhist temples discovered to date in the region of Khotan.  Originally constructed during the 7th century, the site in Tuopulukedun was excavated from September 20 to August, 2010.&lt;ref name=PeoplesDaily&gt;

Within the temple lay fragments of well-preserved sculptures and painted frescos of the Buddha and his disciples.  Throughout the four walls of the temple were paintings that depicted with painstaking detail the characters who appeared within the Mahayana scriptures.  Despite being within this rather confined space, the archaeologists found brightly colored frescos to be abundant within the temple, more so than any other temple within the region.  In the center of the painted interior stood a 60-foot tall stone statue of Siddartha Gautama &lt;ref&gt;

The statues and the frescos reflected different influences from different regions of Asia, perhaps due to Khotan’s convenient location in the Silk Road.  While the statues reflected Bactrian and Greco-Buddhist influence, the painted frescos on the walls were a prelude to those later found in Tibetan and Chinese Buddhist monasteries.&lt;ref name=Waugh&gt;

===Processionals===
In addition to helping foreign monks with their pilgrimages, Khotanese Buddhism was woven closely into the very fabric of Khotanese culture.  This led not only to the construction of thriving local monastic communities, but also encouraged Khotanese citizens to incorporate the Buddhist faith into their life.  This is particularly the case during the first two weeks of June, when processional ceremonies were practiced.  Everyone from the Khotanese royal family to the common merchants and laborers would come together within the capital city and, during these two weeks, would offer carriages to the King’s New Monastery [Faxian].  Lavishly filled with what Faxian refers to as the seven precious substances (the Sapta-ratna, gold, silver, lapis lazuli, rock crystal, rubies, diamonds or emeralds, and agate).&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and prominently displaying an image of the Buddha with two Boddhisatvas on the side, one carriage was carried per day throughout the two-week holiday. 
 
{{quote |When (the car) was a hundred paces from the gate, the king put off his crown of state, changed his dress for a fresh suit, and with bare feet, carrying in his hands flowers and incense, and with two rows of attending followers, went out at the gate to meet the image; and, with his head and face (bowed to the ground), he did homage at its feet, and then scattered the flowers and burnt the incense. When the image was entering the gate, the queen and the brilliant ladies with her in the gallery above scattered far and wide all kinds of flowers, which floated about and fell promiscuously to the ground. In this way everything was done to promote the dignity of the occasion. The carriages of the monasteries were all different, and each one had its own day for the procession &lt;ref name=Faxian/&gt;{{rp|23}} }}

===Farhad-beg-yailaki===
[[Farhad-beg-yailaki]] lies on the southern [[Silk Road]] in the [[Kingdom of Khotan]]. Sir [[Mark Aurel Stein]] explored the remains of Buddhist shrines there which he dated from the fourth to sixth century AD. Stein discovered Buddha statues wearing robes with bright floral designs on which had piles of fabrics offered at their feet in worship. Stein concluded that there was evidence of contact with many cultures in Farhad-beg-yailaki. Murals found there depicted two important Buddhist mythological figures, [[Hariti]] and [[Avalokitesvara]], draped in cloth with [[Sassanian]] designs on.&lt;ref name="vam.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sir Aurel Stein and the Silk Road finds|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/t/the-silk-road-finds-maps-3/|accessdate=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Balawaste===
[[Balawaste]] is a ruin site in the eastern part of the [[Khotan]] oasis, near the village of [[Domoko]] on the southern arm of the [[Silk Road]]. It was dsicovered by Sir Mark Aurel Stein on his first and second expeditions in 1900 and 1906 respectively. Stein found fragments of manuscripts, pottery and plaster in Balawaste, around 94 pieces found by Stein can be combined to form a sequence of life-size Buddhas, [[Bodhisattavas]] and divine beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Encyclopaedia Iranica: Balawaste|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/balawaste-a-ruin-site-in-the-eastern-part-of-the-khotan-oasis-near-the-village-of-domoko|accessdate=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The site is dated to around 600AD based on the clothing style of the divine beings in the paintings found there.&lt;ref name="vam.ac.uk"/&gt;

==Notable Texts==
Khotan’s important location on the Silk Road was not the only draw for traveling Buddhist monks.  The monasteries that existed within the kingdom were famous for their expansive libraries translated copies of classic Mahayana texts, such as the [[Flower Adornment Sutra]] and the [[Golden Light Sutra]].  Even though the Khotanese possessed works that were entirely indigenous in origin, some of their more important collections were translated works that would have otherwise been lost to the Western World.

===''The Book of Zambasta''===
Similar to the message of the Sanghata Sutra, the Khotanese believed that all people are connected to enlightenment and that no one is estranged from the cycle of reincarnation.  To reflect their own interpretations of Mahayana Buddhism, the Khotanese wrote their interpretations of Siddhartha Gautama’s message through fables.  This is best seen through ''The Book of Zambasta'', a miscellany of philosophy and tales involving the Bodhisattva.  The book dates from the 8th century and, while the final length of Zambasta likely exceeded 4000 lines of verse on 440 folios,&lt;ref name=Bailey&gt;
{{cite journal
  |last=Bailey|first=H.W.

  |title=Saka Studies: The Ancient Kingdom of Khotan
  |journal=Iran

  |doi=10.2307/4299633
}}&lt;/ref&gt; only 207 folios have been found thus far.&lt;ref name=Waugh/&gt;{{rp|85}}  As many artifacts from the Buddhist era of Khotan have been looted from their original sites and sold in antique shops to European visitors, it is likely that pages of the manuscript have disappeared.  This makes a complete translation of the book very difficult.&lt;ref name=Waugh/&gt;{{rp|69–72}}

From what has been recovered, it is clear that the book has no singular story line, but rather comprises a vast collection of native interpretations of concepts common in Buddhist philosophy.  These include, but are not limited to:
* A fable about maitrā (love).
* A cautionary tale about the world being merely a parikalpa (false assumption).
* The doctrine of śūnyatā (emptiness.)
* The bodhisambhāra (equipment for enlightenment), which consists of the six pāramitās (perfections) and compassion.
* The samvara (moral restraint) necessary for Bodhisattvas and the ceremony for formal undertaking of the vow to observe restraint.

The book was also famous for its sūtra-styled (“Thus I have heard . . . ”) fable about the spring.   It begins with a beautiful description of spring and the effects it has on younger monks.  The Buddha brings them to a cemetery, where they are reminded of the impermanence of pleasures in this life.&lt;ref name=Emmerick&gt;{{cite book

  |location=London|publisher=Oxford University Press
}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|287–299}}

===Translations of Lost Works===
Similar to the Book of Zambasta, the Jatakastava chronicles the Buddha’s previous lives as both human and animal.  While reliving these past lives, Siddhartha Gautama looks back and talks to himself about the lessons and the characteristics he had to learn prior to becoming the Buddha.  The concise nature of Khotanese texts could especially be seen here, as multiple tales are quickly told within only 26 pages. The origins of the Jatakastava caused some debate within the field of Buddhist studies.  While some scholars argue that the Jatakastava was written and first published in the Kingdom of Khotan, recent evidence suggests that the Jatakastava is not an original text from Khotan, but rather a translation of an older text, presumably one written in Sanskrit.  Regardless, since the Jatakastava written in its original language has been lost,&lt;ref name=Dresden&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|402}} the Khotanese translation is the oldest surviving manuscript.

The Sanghata Sutra was another text that was saved thanks to an early Khotanese translation that dates as early as the 5th century C.E.  The sutra argues that all sentient beings are connected to enlightenment.  Because everyone is connected to the goal enlightenment, one would never have to worry about being disconnected from the path of enlightenment.  Since those who recite the sutra reportedly recite the exact words that the Buddha spoke during his lifetime, the person who recites the text offers his or her voice to serve as a channel by which the Buddha’s presence within his teachings can spread across the world.  Prior to the discovery of the Sanskrit original in 1931&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Khotanese translation was the oldest surviving manuscript of the sutra.  While it was most popular within Central Asia, the sutra’s influence has since expanded to become an integral part of Tibetan and Chinese Buddhism as well, as more localized and more expansive translations have been found within those societies.

{{refimprove|date=May 2010}}
{{Cannabis sidebar}}
'''Charas''' ([[Hindustani language|Hindustani]]) is the name given to a [[hashish]] form of [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] which is handmade in the [[Indian subcontinent]] and [[Jamaica]]. It is made from the [[resin]] of the [[cannabis]] plant (''[[Cannabis sativa]]'' or ''[[Cannabis indica]]''). The plant grows wild throughout Northern India along the stretch of the [[Himalayas]] (its putative origin) and is an important [[cash crop]] for the local people. The difference between charas and hashish is that hashish is made from a dead cannabis plant and charas is made from a live one.

==History==
Hashish has been used across the [[Indian subcontinent]] for medicinal and religious purposes for thousands of years,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mapinc.org/drugnews/v08/n282/a01.html "If Drugs Were Legal, Scarlett Might Be Alive"]. ''[[The Times of India]], 14 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and was sold in government shops (along with [[opium]]) during the times of the [[British India]] and in independent India until the 1980s ([[marijuana]] and [[bhang]] is still being sold in parts of [[Rajasthan, India]]).&lt;ref name="commission"&gt;''[[Indian Hemp Drugs Commission|Report of the Indian Hemp Drugs Commission]], 1893–94''. Simla, India: Government Central Printing House, 1894, 7 vols., [http://www.druglibrary.net/schaffer/Library/studies/inhemp/5chapt14.htm CHAPTER XIV. THE POLICY OF HEMP DRUG ADMINISTRATION]&lt;/ref&gt;

Charas plays an important and often integral role in the [[culture]] and [[ritual]] of certain sects of the [[Hindu]] [[religion]], especially among the [[Shaivism|Shaiv]]s — the sub-division of [[Hinduism]] holding Lord [[Shiva]] to be the supreme god (in contrast to [[Vaishnav]]s who believe Lord [[Vishnu]] is the supreme god)—and it is venerated by some as being one of the aspects of Lord Shiva.

Despite this long history, charas was made illegal in India under pressure from the [[United States]] in the 1980s and severe sentences were introduced for cultivation and [[Illegal drug trade|trafficking]] of charas. Even the mere [[Possession (law)|possession]] had a mandatory ten-year prison sentence. These [[laws]] have been relaxed, but charas remains a popular medium for police to extort money from consumers of the drug.&lt;ref&gt;http://pugodesk.winwinhosting.net/dailyexcelsior/charas-smuggler-acquitted-as-witnesses-contradict-each-other/{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even at the peak of the crackdown, charas was still popular and remains so today, especially among young professionals and Indian [[sadhu]]s. The [[Naga (mythology)|Naga]] Sadhus, [[Aghori]]s and [[Tantra|Tantric]] [[Bhairava]] sects smoke it freely as an integral part of their religious practice. Many smoke it in clay pipes called [[chillum (pipe)|chillums]], using a cotton cloth to cover the smoking end of the chillum and inserting a tightly packed pebble-sized cone of clay as filter under the chunk of charas. Before lighting the chillum they will chant the many names of Shiva in [[veneration]]. It is regaining the popularity it once enjoyed with younger generation of India regarding it as a recreational drug of choice. It is freely available in several places around India especially where there is a strong affluence of tourists ([[Goa]], [[Delhi]], [[Rishikesh]], [[Varanasi]], etc.). Although charas can be found in several places around India, its manufacturing can be traced only to specific locations in India such as, [[Parvati Valley]], ([[Kasol]], Rasol, [[Malana, Himachal Pradesh|Malana]] ("Malana cream"), [[Kashmir]] as well as several other places in northern India. In southern India there are also several places where charas is manufactured.

Charas can be found in many places around India simply because there are people that take charas from the "source" to distribute it in areas where there is a substantial demand of it (usually areas with a lot of foreigners). The nominal price of charas in these areas is substantially higher than in the places where charas is made. There is also a large amount of charas that is illegally exported across to [[Europe]].

==Cultivation==
[[File:Tosh Valley charas.jpg|right|thumb|Tosh Valley charas]]
High quality hashish in India comes from cannabis grown in the mountains. The variety from [[Himachal Pradesh]] is considered to be of the highest quality throughout India. It is easily available in [[Kinnaur]], [[Shimla]], [[Karsog]], [[Kumharsain|Kumarsain]], ([[Kullu]]-[[Malana, Himachal Pradesh|Malana]]) &amp; [[Rampur Bushahr]]; practically every area in Himachal Pradesh. For this reason, the Indian subcontinent has become very popular with backpackers and [[Drug smuggling|drug smugglers]].{{cn|date=July 2018}}

During hand-harvesting, live cannabis plants' flowering buds (as opposed to dried plants/buds) are rubbed between the palms of the harvesters' hands, and by the end of the day one has perhaps 8 or 9&amp;nbsp;grams of charas. The faster one works, the lower the quality of charas; hence to make "Malana cream" it is necessary to go very slowly and make only a few grams a day. Nowadays production of cannabis in the Himalayas has increased with growing demand for Malana cream; the ancient art of manufacturing is disappearing under the pressure to capitalize on the domestic and international market for charas.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

High quality charas was also produced in [[Nepal]] and sold in government monopoly stores in [[Kathmandu]] until the [[Kingdom of Nepal|government]] gave in to international pressure and got out of the business in the 1970s. [[Rolpa district]] in western Nepal was a production center, with [[Cannabis (drug)|ganja]] and charas both an important cash crop in this extremely isolated, underdeveloped and impoverished region.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

===Mixtures with tobacco===

Charas is smoked, usually mixed with [[cigarette]] [[tobacco]] and rolled back into the cigarette blank.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.groups.psychology.org.au/Assets/Files/National_Cannabis_Strategy_Consultation_Paper.pdf Australian Government Department of Health: National Cannabis Strategy Consultation Paper] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227051735/http://www.groups.psychology.org.au/Assets/Files/National_Cannabis_Strategy_Consultation_Paper.pdf |date=2011-02-27 }}, p.&amp;nbsp;4. "''Cannabis'' has been described as a 'Trojan Horse' for nicotine addiction, given the usual method of mixing ''Cannabis'' with tobacco when preparing marijuana for administration."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rolling paper]] is also used to smoke charas. Charas with tobacco mixture is filled into the rolling paper to make a joint.

[[File:Carteret beis medrash.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Chavrusas (study partners) sit opposite each other or side by side in the [[beth midrash|beis medrash]] of [[Yeshiva Gedola of Carteret]]]]
'''''Chavrusa''''', also spelled '''''chavruta''''' or '''''havruta''''' ([[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]: חַבְרוּתָא, lit. "friendship" or "companionship"), is a traditional [[Rabbinic Judaism|rabbinic]] approach to [[Talmud]]ic study in which a small group of students (usually 2-5) analyze, discuss, and debate a shared text. It is a primary learning method in [[yeshiva]]s and [[kollel]]s, where students often engage regular study partners of similar knowledge and ability, and is also practiced by men and boys outside the yeshiva setting, in work, home and vacation settings. The traditional phrase is to learn ''b'chavrusa'' (בְחַבְרוּתָא, "in ''chavrusa''"; i.e., in partnership); the word has come by [[metonymy]] to refer to the study partner as an individual, though it would more logically describe the pair.

Unlike a teacher-student relationship, in which the student memorizes and repeats the material back in tests, ''chavrusa''-style learning puts each student in the position of analyzing the text, organizing his thoughts into logical arguments, explaining his reasoning to his partner, hearing out his partner's reasoning, and questioning and sharpening each other's ideas, often arriving at entirely new insights into the meaning of the text.&lt;ref name="agora"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jeff"/&gt;

While ''chavrusa''-style learning is traditionally practiced by men and boys, it has also become popular in women's yeshivas that study Talmudic texts. In the 2000s it was extended to telephone and [[internet]] learning sessions in which partners study Talmud as well as other traditional Jewish texts.

When three or more students learn together, they are called a ''[[chavurah]]'' ({{lang-he|חַבוּרָה}}, group).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clickdesign.com/CLIENTDEMOS/edos/classes.htm |title=Adult Education Catalogue/Spring 2003 |publisher=East Denver Orthodox Synagogue |year=2003 |accessdate=26 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326034009/http://www.clickdesign.com/CLIENTDEMOS/edos/classes.htm |archivedate=26 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reform Judaism]] has expanded the idea of ''chavrusa'' to include two, three, four or even five individuals studying together.&lt;ref name=jeff/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.shirshalom.org/pdfs/Scribe-May-Jun-11.pdf|title=Turn It Again &amp;ndash; The Joy of Shabbat Tish|first=Rabbi Michael L. |last=Moskowitz |journal=Scribe |date=May–June 2011 |volume=24 |issue=5 &amp; 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also extended the material being studied beyond traditional texts, to modern scholarship and poetry.&lt;ref name="jeff"/&gt; The Reform and [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] movements have also altered the idea of ''chavurah'' from its Orthodox meaning of groups that meet only for Torah study.

Based on statements in the Mishnah and Gemara, ''chavrusa'' learning was a key feature of yeshivas in the eras of the [[Tannaim]] (Rabbis of the Mishnaic period, 10-220 CE) and [[Amoraim]] (Rabbis of the Talmudic period, 200 to 500 CE). The Rabbis repeatedly urged their students to acquire a study partner; for example, Rabbi [[Joshua ben Perachyah|Yehoshua ben Perachya]] enjoined students to "Make for yourself a Rav and acquire for yourself a ''chaver''",&lt;ref&gt;''[[Pirkei Avot|Avot]]'' 1:6.&lt;/ref&gt; and Rabbi [[Jose ben Halafta|Yose ben Chalafta]] told his son Rabbi Abba that he was ignorant because he did not study with someone else.&lt;ref&gt;''Yerushalmi Nedarim'' 11:1, 41c.&lt;/ref&gt; The choice of ''chavrusas'' seems to have been based on friendship or social proximity; thus, ''chavrusas'' fulfilled a social as well as an educational need.&lt;ref name=cath&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bKMkEVSvCoUC&amp;pg=PA351 |title=The Social Structure of the Rabbinic Movement in Roman Palestine |page=351 |last=Hezser |first=Catherine |year=1997 |publisher= Mohr Siebeck |isbn= 978-3-16-146797-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While an individual may choose to study Talmud alone, it is strongly discouraged. In the Talmud, [[Jose b. Hanina|R. Yosi b. R. Hanina]] is quoted as saying that "scholars who sit alone to study the Torah ... become stupid" (''[[Berakhot (Talmud)|Berakhot]]'' 63b).&lt;ref name=sinclair/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.on1foot.org/text/babylonian-talmud-brachot-63b|title=Babylonian Talmud Brachot 63b|publisher=American Jewish World Service|accessdate=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Chavrusa''-style learning is particularly suited to Talmud study, as the latter is a text filled with conflicting opinions and seemingly contradictory statements on principles of Jewish law. Besides tracking the back-and-forth debates, a student of Talmud must be able to analyze each opinion and present hypotheses to reconcile it in light of the others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpost.com/Magazine/Opinion/Think-Again-Talmud-Study-and-the-Liberal-Arts|title=Think Again: Talmud Study and the Liberal Arts|first=Jonathan |last=Rosenblum |authorlink=Jonathan Rosenblum|date=11 November 2011 |accessdate=8 April 2013|work=[[The Jerusalem Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''chavrusa'' relationship gives each student a platform to clarify and explain his position to a partner; then the two go on to question, defend, convince, amend, fine-tune, and even arrive at new conclusions through rigorous intellectual collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oohY_3hMFS8C&amp;pg=PA418|title= Gateway to Judaism: The What, How, And Why of Jewish Life|first=Mordechai |last=Becker|authorlink=Gateways (organization)#Rabbi Mordechai Becker|publisher=[[ArtScroll|Mesorah Publications, Ltd.]] |year=2005|isbn= 1422600300  |pages=418, 422&amp;ndash;423}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=balt&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2003-09-25/news/0309250131_1_talmud-israel-rabbinical-college-ner-israel |title=Study Form Ancient, But Lessons Modern|first=Frank |last=Langfitt|date=25 September 2003 |accessdate=8 April 2013|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike conventional classroom learning, in which a teacher lectures to the student and the student memorizes and repeats the information back in tests, and unlike an academic seminary, where students do independent research,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/torah_portion/article/learning_together_20030606/ |title=Learning Together |date=5 June 2003 |accessdate=26 June 2011 |last=Bouskila |first=Rabbi Daniel |work=[[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''chavrusa'' learning challenges the student to analyze and verbally explain the material, point out the errors in his partner's reasoning, and question and sharpen each other's ideas, often arriving at entirely new insights into the meaning of the text.&lt;ref name="agora"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jeff"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rebjeff.com/1/category/singing/1.html |title=Bringing the People Together |date=24 February 2011 |accessdate=26 June 2011|publisher=Reb Jeff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bamboo/&gt;

A ''chavrusa'' helps the student stay awake, keep his mind focused on the learning, sharpen his reasoning powers, develop his thoughts into words, and organize his thoughts into logical arguments.&lt;ref name="zobin"&gt;{{cite book |pages=104&amp;ndash;106 |title=Breakthrough to Learning Gemora: A concise, analytical guide |last=Zobin |first=Zvi |year=1996 |publisher=Kest-Lebovits}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of learning also imparts precision and clarity into ideas that would otherwise remain vague.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kollel.com/iajs |title=Chavrusa System of Learning |publisher=Kollel Toronto |year=2010 |accessdate=26 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having to listen to, analyze and respond to another's opinion inculcates respect for others.

==Practice==
''Chavrusa'' learning takes place in the formalized structure of the yeshiva or kollel, as well as in Talmudic study that an individual does at any time of day. Although a man skilled in learning could study certain topics on his own, the ''chavrusa'' relationship is preferred to help him crystallize his thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lFvQ79N9vIAC&amp;printsec=frontcover |pages=110&amp;ndash;111 |title=The World of the Yeshiva: An intimate portrait of Orthodox Jewry |last=Helmreich |first=William B. |publisher=Ktav Publishing House |year=2000 |isbn=0-88125-642-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the yeshiva setting, students prepare for and review the ''[[Shiur (Torah)|shiur]]'' (lecture) with their ''chavrusas'' during morning, afternoon, and evening study sessions known as ''sedarim''.&lt;ref name="Forta"/&gt; On average, a yeshiva student spends ten hours per day learning in ''chavrusa''.&lt;ref name="Helmreich, p. 112"&gt;Helmreich, ''The World of the Yeshiva'', p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Since having the right ''chavrusa'' makes all the difference between having a good year and a bad year, class rebbis may switch ''chavrusas'' eight or nine times in a class of 20 boys until the partnerships work for both sides.&lt;ref name="Helmreich, p. 112"/&gt; If a ''chavrusa'' gets stuck on a difficult point or needs further clarification, they can turn to the rabbis, lecturers, or a ''sho'el u'mashiv'' (literally, "ask and answer", a rabbi who is intimately familiar with the Talmudic text being studied) who are available to them in the study hall during ''sedarim''. In women's yeshiva programs, teachers are on hand to guide the ''chavrusas''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spider.mc.yu.edu/news/articles/article.cfm?id=101213 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060831161538/http://spider.mc.yu.edu/news/articles/article.cfm?id=101213 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=31 August 2006 |title=Stern College's June Learning Program Exposes Students to Intense, In-Depth Learning |date=6 July 2006 |accessdate=26 June 2011 |publisher=[[Yeshiva University]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Chavrusa'' learning tends to be loud and animated, as the study partners read the Talmudic text and the commentaries aloud to each other and then analyze, question, debate, and defend their points of view to arrive at a mutual understanding of the text. In the heat of discussion, they may wave their hands or even shout at each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WVvAe_U9stsC&amp;pg=PA422 |page=422 |title=The Blackwell Reader in Judaism |last1=Neusner |first1=Jacob |last2=Avery-Peck |first2=Alan J. |publisher=[[Blackwell Publishers]] |year=2001 |isbn=0-631-20738-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the size of the yeshiva, dozens or even hundreds of ''chavrusas'' can be heard discussing and debating each other's opinions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-20wAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=chavruta |title= Ein Yaakov: The ethical and inspirational teachings of the Talmud |page=xxix |last=Finkel |first=Avraham Yaakov |year=1999 |publisher=[[Jason Aronson]] |isbn=0-7657-6082-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?ei=Gm0HTsaAINSAhQeF7YHoDQ&amp;ct=result&amp;id=XBZ6AAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=yeshiva+chavrusa&amp;q=cacophony |page=203 |title= The Reichmanns: Family, faith, fortune, and the empire of Olympia &amp; York |last=Bianco |first=Anthony |publisher=Times Books |year=1997 |isbn= 0-8129-2140-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the skills of ''chavrusa'' learning is the ability to block out all other discussions in the study hall and focus on one's study partner alone.&lt;ref name="Forta"/&gt;

==Choosing a ''chavrusa''==
Pairing up study partners has been compared to making a ''[[shidduch]]'' (marriage match), as the skills, interests, temperament and schedule of each person must be taken into consideration.&lt;ref name=bamboo/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://toldot.ru/en/engarticles/eng-articles_6485.html|title= Chavrusa across the country, or: A Siyum once in three and a half years|date=27 November 2007 |accessdate=8 April 2013|publisher=[[Toldos Yeshurun]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://demosthenesneedsalocke.blogspot.co.il/2010/01/chavrusa-shidduch-world.html|title=The Chavrusa Shidduch World |date=6 January 2010|accessdate=8 April 2013|publisher=Demosthenes Needs a Locke}}&lt;/ref&gt; Good friends do not necessarily make good ''chavrusas''. If the ''chavrusas'' spend too much time chatting or joking with each other at the expense of their study time, they are advised to find different study partners.&lt;ref name="Helmreich, p. 112"/&gt;

In the yeshiva world, the brightest students are highly desirable as ''chavrusas''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D8cRAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=chavrusa |title=With Hearts Full of Faith: Insights into trust and emunah: A selection of addresses |last1=Reinman |first1=Yaakov Yosef |last2=Salomon |first2=Matisyohu |authorlink1=Yosef Reinman |authorlink2=Matisyohu Salomon |publisher=Mesorah Publications, Ltd. |year=2002 |page=94 |isbn=1-57819-583-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are pros and cons to learning with ''chavrusas'' who are stronger, weaker, or equal in knowledge and ability to the student. A stronger ''chavrusa'' will correct and fill in the student's knowledge and help him improve his learning techniques, acting more like a teacher. With a ''chavrusa'' who is equal in knowledge and ability, the student is forced to prove his point with logic rather than by right of seniority, which improves his ability to think logically, analyze other people's opinions objectively, and accept criticism. With a weaker ''chavrusa'', who often worries over and questions each step, the student is forced to understand the material thoroughly, refine and organize his thoughts in a logical structure, present his viewpoint clearly, and be ready to justify each and every point. The stronger ''chavrusa'' helps the student acquire a great deal of information, but the weaker ''chavrusa'' helps the student learn ''how'' to learn. Yeshiva students are usually advised to have one of each of these three types of ''chavrusas'' in order to develop on all three levels.&lt;ref name="zobin"/&gt;

==Other uses==

===Zionist ideal===
[[Zionism|Zionist]] ideologue [[A. D. Gordon]] used the term ''chavrusa'' to refer to a communal society, such as the [[moshav]], [[kibbutz]], or worker's association, which acts as a self-educational link to the larger social-educational process. In Zionist thought, the ''chavrusa'' is "a central tool in the struggle for the revival of the Jewish people, the revival of the individual, and the centrality of the idea of 'labor'. It is the highest expression of the Jewish person's extraordinary effort to recreate him or herself through 'labor', to be reconnected to nature, and to plant the many-branched tree of his or her nation in the land from which it was uprooted".&lt;ref&gt;Amir, Yehoyada.

'''Ethel Jenner Rosenberg''' (August 6, 1858 - November 17, 1930) became the first [[Bahá'í Faith in England|English Bahá'í]]. 

Rosenberg became a Bahá'í when she converted in 1899, after having been introduced to the [[Bahá'í Faith]] by Mary Thornburgh-Cropper, an American resident in London who had converted in 1898. Rosenberg was born in the city of [[Bath, Somerset]] to a [[Jewish]] family and was a painter trained at the [[Slade School of Fine Art]] in London. She was [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]]'s social secretary during his [[`Abdu'l-Bahá's journeys to the West#Great Britain|visits to London]]. `Abdu'l-Bahá asked her, among others, to give consideration to publishing Bahá'í books, which resulted in the publication of ''`Abdu'l-Bahá in London'' and ''A Brief Account of the Bahai Movement.''  Rosenberg also assisted [[Laura Clifford Barney]] in compiling ''[[Some Answered Questions]]'' and [[Sara Blomfield|Lady Blomfield]] in compiling ''[[Paris Talks]].''

Rosenberg traveled to America three times, initially doing so with [[Mírzá Abu'l-Fadl]] and Laura Clifford Barney. She would spend many months in the United States and stayed with [[Phoebe Hearst]].

Rosenberg made three [[Bahá'í pilgrimage|pilgrimages]] to Haifa, in 1904, 1909 and 1921. When she arrived in Haifa for her third pilgrimage, in 1921, she found that `Abdu'l-Bahá had recently died. Remaining in Haifa, she greeted Lady Blomfield, [[Shoghi Effendi]], and Shoghi Effendi's sister Ruhangiz when the three arrived from England on December 29, 1921. Shoghi Effendi gave her instructions for the calling of the first National [[Spiritual Assembly]] of England, which she would serve on.

The '''Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church''' is an offshoot of the [[Rastafari]] movement that flourished in the 1970s in Jamaica and was incorporated in [[Florida]] in 1975. Members of the movement say it is based on the teachings of [[Marcus Garvey]] and that they use  [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] as the Rastafari [[sacrament]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/hemp/potbible.htm Marijuana and the Bible]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979 the group was accused, tried, and convicted of smuggling massive amounts of potent cannabis from [[Jamaica]] to [[Miami]] in actions that kept the Jamaican economy afloat that decade. The then-Jamaican Prime Minister [[Edward Seaga]] told a U.S. interview "It's just a little ''[[:wikt:sinsemilla|sinsemilla]]'' that it keep the country going right now". The Coptics published a free newspaper promoting Garveyism and the decriminalization of marijuana. They were also featured on a sensational episode of ''[[60 Minutes]]'' on October 28, 1979. The group's leader was Thomas Reilly, also known as [[Brother Louv]]. During the same year, The Supreme Court of Florida found: "(1) the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church represents a religion within the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and (2) the “use of cannabis is an essential portion of the religious practice."&lt;ref name="Court"/&gt; "Further, the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church is not a new church or religion but the record reflects it is centuries old and has regularly used cannabis as its sacrament”.&lt;ref name="Court"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ethiopianzioncopticchurch.org/Legal/Town_1979|title=Town v. State, 377 So.2d 648 (Fla. 1979)|date=November 1, 1979|accessdate=March 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986 the organization participated in the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]]'s hearings on [[cannabis rescheduling in the United States]].

On August 8, 1994 [[Jim Tranmer]], a former member of the group, wrote a letter to Carl Olsen while meditating on his 35-year prison sentence and his departure from the EZCC's "malicious hierarchy".  Olsen ran for governor in Iowa, as a Libertarian, in 1994 and for the U.S. House of Representatives, again as a Libertarian, in 1996.  He is currently a priest in the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church, and resides in Iowa.

The EZCC is not associated with the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]] or the [[Coptic Catholic Church]], both based in [[Egypt]]. The Coptic Orthodox Church has an Ethiopian sister church, which is also unrelated.

The Zion Coptic Church was featured in the 2011 [[Billy Corben]] documentary ''[[Square Grouper: The Godfathers of Ganja]]'', whose first section concerns the group and features interviews with former members.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="52422">'''Freedom of religion in Iran''' is marked by [[Iranian culture]], [[Islam in Iran|major religion]] and [[Politics of Iran|politics]]. [[Iran]] is officially and in practice an [[Islamic republic]]—the [[Constitution of Islamic Republic of Iran|Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran]] mandates that the official religion of Iran is [[Shia Islam]] and the [[Twelvers|Twelver]] [[Ja'fari jurisprudence|Ja'fari school]], and also mandates that other Islamic schools are to be accorded full respect, and their followers are free to act in accordance with their own jurisprudence in performing their religious rites. Iran recognizes [[Zoroastrian]], [[Jewish]], and [[Christian]] [[Demographics of Iran|religious minorities]], among others.&lt;ref name="fdih1"&gt;{{cite web|date=2003-08-01 |title=Discrimination against religious minorities in Iran |author=International Federation for Human Rights |publisher=fdih.org |accessdate=2006-10-20 |url=http://www.fidh.org/IMG/pdf/ir0108a.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The continuous presence of the country's pre-Islamic, non-Muslim communities, such as Zoroastrians, Jews, and Christians, had accustomed the population to the participation of non-Muslims in society. However, despite official recognition of such minorities by Iran's government, the actions of the government create a "threatening atmosphere for some religious minorities".&lt;ref name=2006Report&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71421.htm|title=International Religious Freedom Report 2006 - Iran|accessdate=2006-11-08|author=U.S. Department of State|date=2005-09-15|publisher=U.S. Department of State}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious demography==
The country has a total area of approximately 1,636,000&amp;nbsp;km² (632,000&amp;nbsp;mi²), and its population is approximately 69 million. In 2006, the population was approximately 98 percent Muslim, of which an estimated 89% were [[Shi'a Islam|Shi'a]] and 9% [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] (mostly [[Turkic peoples|Turkomen]], [[Arab]]s, [[Baloch people|Baluchs]], and [[Kurdish people|Kurds]] living in the southwest, southeast, and northwest). Although there are no official statistics of the size of the Sufi Muslim population, some reports estimated between two and five million people practice Sufism compared to approximately 100,000 before 1979.&lt;ref name=2006Report/&gt;

Bahá'ís, Christians, [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]], [[Mandaeanism|Mandaeans]], and Jews combined constitute approximately two percent of the population. The largest non-Muslim minority is the Bahá'í community, which has an estimated 300,000 to 350,000 adherents throughout the country. Estimates on the size of the Jewish community vary from 20,000 to 30,000. These figures represent a substantial reduction from the estimated 75,000 to 80,000 Jews who resided in the country prior to the 1979 [[Iranian Revolution]]. According to U.N. figures, there were approximately 300,000 Christians, the majority of whom are ethnic Armenians. Unofficial estimates indicated an Assyrian Christian population of approximately 10,000. There also were Protestant denominations, including evangelical churches. The Mandaean Sabaeans, a community whose religion draws on pre-Christian gnostic beliefs, numbered approximately 5,000 to 10,000 persons, with members residing primarily in Khuzestan in the southwest. As of 2006, there were indications that members of all religious minorities are emigrating at a higher rate than previously.&lt;ref name=2006Report /&gt;

==Status of religious freedom==
Although the Constitution states that "the investigation of individuals' beliefs is forbidden" and that "no one may be molested or taken to task simply for holding a certain belief,"&lt;ref name=IranConstitution&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oefre.unibe.ch/law/icl/ir00000_.html|title=Constitution of Iran|accessdate=2006-11-08|publisher=translation provided by the Iranian embassy in London|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004120826/http://www.oefre.unibe.ch/law/icl/ir00000_.html| archivedate=October 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; the adherents of religions not specifically protected under the Constitution do not enjoy freedom of activity. This situation most directly affects adherents of the [[Bahá'í Faith]]. The Government regards the Bahá'í community, whose faith originally arose from a [[Shaykh Ahmad#Shaykhí teachings|movement within Islam]], as a misguided or wayward "sect."&lt;ref name="int"&gt;{{cite web|title=Letter from the Iranian Ministry of the Interior |author=Ministry of the Interior |url=http://www.bahai.org/persecution/iran/19-08-06 |accessdate=2006-11-08 |date=2006-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the Expediency Council approved appending a note to Article 297 of the 1991 Islamic Punishments Act, authorizing collection of equal "blood money" (diyeh) for the death of Muslims and non-Muslims. All women and Baha'i men were excluded from the equalization provisions of the bill. According to law, Baha'i blood or anyones' who marries or helps a Bahá'í or gets involved with them is considered Mobah, meaning it can be spilled with impunity.&lt;ref name=2006Report/&gt;

The Government fuels anti-Bahá'í sentiment in the country. Government officials have stated that the Bahá'ís are not a religious minority, but a political organization which was associated with the Shah's regime, is against the Iranian Revolution and engages in espionage activities.&lt;ref name="buck"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Christopher |last=Buck |title=Islam and Minorities: The Case of the Bahá'ís |journal=Studies in Contemporary Islam |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=83–106 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, government officials reportedly nonetheless have stated that, as individuals, all Bahá'ís are entitled to their beliefs and are protected under other articles of the Constitution as citizens.  The Iranian representative to the [[United Nations]] tried several times, albeit unsuccessfully, between 1982 and 1984 to convince the United Nations diplomatic community that the Bahá'í Faith is a politicized organization with a record of criminal activism against the Iranian government.&lt;ref name="ghanea"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Nazila |last=Ghanea |title=Human Rights, the UN &amp; the Bahá'ís in Iran |publisher=Kluwer Law International |location=The Hague/London/New York |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations responded to the Iranian government's accusations by stating that there has been no evidence of Iran's claims and that the Bahá'í community in Iran professes its allegiance to the state. The United Nations pointed to the Bahá'í teaching of obedience to the government of one's country and stated that any involvement in any subversive acts against the government would be antithetical to precepts of the Bahá'í religion.&lt;ref name="ghanea" /&gt; The United Nations also stated that if the Iranian government did acknowledge that the Bahá'í Faith is a religion, it would be an admission that freedom of religion does not apply to all in Iran and that it is not abiding by the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and International Covenants on Human Rights to which it is a signatory.&lt;ref name="buck" /&gt;

Unlike the Bahá'í Faith, [[Judaism]] is a recognized religion in Iran. Despite Iran's official distrust of the country of [[Israel]], the government does not directly attack Judaism itself.

The central feature of the country's Islamic republican system is rule by a "religious jurisconsult." The [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Supreme Leader of Islamic Republic]] controls the most important levers of power; he is chosen by a group of 86 religious scholars. All acts of the [[Majlis of Iran|Majles]] (legislative body) must be reviewed for conformity with Islamic law and principles by the Council of Guardians, which is composed of six clerics appointed by the Supreme Leader and six Muslim jurists (legal scholars) nominated by the Head of the Judiciary and elected by parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Religious activity is monitored closely by the Ministry of Islamic Culture and Guidance and by the Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS). Adherents of recognized religious minorities are not required to register individually with the Government; however, their community, religious, and cultural events and organizations, including schools, are monitored closely. Registration of Bahá'ís is a police function. [[Evangelical Christian]] groups have been pressured by government authorities to compile and submit membership lists for their congregations, but evangelicals have resisted this demand. Non-Muslim owners of grocery shops are required to indicate their religious affiliation on the fronts of their shops.&lt;ref name=2006Report/&gt;

==Restrictions on religious freedom==
By law and practice, religious minorities can be elected to a representative body or to hold senior government or military positions, and have 5 of a total 270 seats in the majlis reserved for religious minorities. Three of these seats are reserved for members of the Christian faith, including two seats for the country's Armenian Christians, and one for Assyrians. There is also one seat for a member of the Jewish faith, and one for a member of the Zoroastrian faith. While members of the Sunni Muslim minority do not have reserved seats in the majlis, they are allowed to serve in the body. Sunni members tend to come from the larger Sunni communities. Members of religious minorities are allowed to vote. All of the minority religious groups, including Sunni Muslims, are barred from being elected president.&lt;ref name=2006Report/&gt;

Members of religious minorities, are supported in their pursuit of serving in the judiciary and security services. All applicants for public sector employment are screened, irrespective of their faith, for their adherence to and knowledge of Islam, and members of religious minorities can serve in lower ranks of government employment. The constitution states that the country's army must be administered by individuals who are committed to the objectives of the Iranian constitution, regardless of faith. No religious minorities are exempt from military service. Members of religious minorities with a college education could serve as an officer during their mandatory military service but could not be a career military officer.&lt;ref name=2006Report/&gt;

University applicants are required to pass an examination in Islamic theology, which limits the access of most religious minorities to higher education, although all public school students, including non-Muslims, must study Shia Islam. Applicants for public sector employment similarly are screened for their knowledge of Islam.&lt;ref name=2006Report/&gt;

The Government allows recognized religious minorities to conduct the religious education of their adherents. This includes separate and privately funded Zoroastrian, Jewish, and Christian schools but does not include Bahá'í schools. The Ministry of Education, which imposes certain curriculum requirements, supervises these schools. With few exceptions, the directors of such private schools must be Muslim. Attendance at the schools is not mandatory for recognized religious minorities. All textbooks used in course work, including religious texts, must be approved for use by the Ministry of Education. Religious texts in non-Persian languages require approval by the authorities for use. Recognized religious minorities could provide religious instruction in non-Persian languages, but such texts required approval by the authorities. This approval requirement sometimes imposed significant translation expenses on minority communities.&lt;ref name=2006Report/&gt; The condition imposed began from 1981 and were reiterated in the fall of 1983 - the Ministry of Education and Training ordered that religious education must be done in Persian, a text written by the MET must be taught in all registered religious minority schools, schools must seek special permission for any ceremonies, and in keeping with society-wide restrictions, female teachers and students must observe Islamic dress code including [[Hijab]] when necessary (this last was re-inforced in 1985.)&lt;ref name="Sanas2000"&gt;

There have been other requirements of citizens as well. In 1984 the government began to request religious affiliation on questionnaires for passports. Events held for religious groups were broken into and if the meetings were mixed sexed and or women were not wearing headscarves, arrests were made and meetings canceled. It was prohibited that Muslims attend these meetings of minority groups - some groups restricted events so only their own religious members could attend. There were restrictions on music at events. Many of these restrictions moderated in time or were applied to or affected one religion more vs others (see below) and the government has occasionally also taken steps to bring attention to issues important to a religion - in 1982 the Ministry of Post and Telegraphs printed a stamp commemorating the birth of Jesus.&lt;ref name="Sanas2000"/&gt;

The textbook the MET wrote on the minority religions was called Talimat-e Maxhadi Vizheh-ye Aqaliathaye Mazhabi - (Kalimi, Zarthoshti, Masihi); Religious Studies Specifically for Religious Minorities: (Jews, Zoroastrians, Christians.)&lt;ref name="Sanas2000"/&gt; The course was taught by Muslim teachers at least 3 hrs/wk. All the religious minorities objected to the text in 1982 claiming the book was a violation of Article 13 guaranteeing freedom in religious teaching, that there were overt and covert passages from the Quran, and lack of any qualifications of the anonymous author(s) rather than members of the religious minorities writing about their own religions.  The situation has moderated for the Armenians significantly by 1995/6.&lt;ref name="UNHCR-Armenia"/&gt; There was also compromise of sorts allowed both Hebrew and Persian language use in Jewish schools.&lt;ref name="UNHCR-Jews"&gt;{{Cite web| title =  Iran: Information on the Jewish community in Tehran between 1990 and 1996, including names of prominent leaders, names of synagogues, important religious events, and information on the arrests between June and September 1993 of four people who were charged with providing fraudulent documents to members of the Jewish community to help them leave the country| work = UNHCR   | publisher = Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada   | date = 1 March 1998 | url = http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/refworld/rwmain?page=search&amp;amp;docid=3ae6ac222c&amp;amp;skip=0 | format =    | doi =   | accessdate =  13 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recognized religious minorities are allowed by the Government to establish community centers and certain cultural, social, sports, or charitable associations that they finance themselves. This does not apply to the Bahá'í community, which since 1983 has been denied the right to assemble officially or to maintain administrative institutions. Because the Bahá'í Faith has no clergy, the denial of the right to form such institutions and elect officers threatens its existence in the country.&lt;ref name=2006Report/&gt;

Muslim men are free to marry non-Muslim women; a non-Muslim woman automatically becomes Muslim when the marriage takes place. However, marriages between Muslim women and non-Muslim men are not recognized unless the man shows proof that he has converted to Islam. If the child of a non-Muslim family converts to Islam, he or she inherits all the wealth of the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Muslim women should be able to marry non-Muslim men |publisher=goatmilkblog.com |date=28 August 2010 |url=http://goatmilkblog.com/2010/08/24/muslim-women-should-be-able-to-marry-non-muslim-men-the-goatmilk-debates/ |accessdate=February 13, 2014 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130822193743/http://goatmilkblog.com/2010/08/24/muslim-women-should-be-able-to-marry-non-muslim-men-the-goatmilk-debates/ |archive-date=22 August 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Government is highly suspicious of any proselytizing of Muslims by non-Muslims and can be harsh in its response, in particular against Bahá'ís, Sunni Muslims and evangelical Christians.

The Government does not ensure the right of citizens to change or renounce their religious faith. Apostasy, specifically [[conversion from Islam]], can be [[capital punishment in Iran|punishable by death]].&lt;ref name="fdih1" /&gt;

A summary of 2013 incidents of prison sentences, fines and punishments showed "79 religious minorities were sentenced to a total of 3620 months in prison, 200 months probation, 75 lashings and 41,030,000,000 rials in fines. In this area, 49% of the cases involved Baha'i minorities, 16% Christian and Dervish and 14% Sunni minority. Arrests of religious minorities increased by 36% in relation to last year."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Human rights activists in Iran publish disturbing annual report summarizing human rights violations in 2013 |newspaper=Iran Daily Brief |date=23 January 2014 |url=http://www.irandailybrief.com/2014/01/23/human-rights-activists-in-iran-publish-disturbing-annual-report-summarizing-human-rights-violations-in-2013/|accessdate=January 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bahá'ís===
The [[Bahá'í Faith]] originated in Iran during the 1860s. The Baha'is believe their prophet to be the Messiah for this era. Initially it attracted a wide following among Shi'a clergy. The political and religious authorities of that time joined to suppress the movement, and since then the hostility of the Shi'a clergy to the Bahá'í Faith has remained strong. Bahá'ís are considered apostates by the Shi'a clergy because of their claim to a valid religious revelation subsequent to that of Mohammed. The Bahá'í Faith is defined by the Government as a political "sect," historically linked to the [[Pahlavi dynasty|Pahlavi regime]] and, hence, counterrevolutionary, even though one of the tenets of the Bahá'í Faith is non-involvement in partisan politics.&lt;ref name="affolter"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Friedrich W. |last=Affolter |title=The Specter of Ideological Genocide: The Bahá'ís of Iran |journal=War Crimes, Genocide and Crimes Against Humanity |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=59–89 |year=2005 |url=http://www.aa.psu.edu/journals/war-crimes/v1n1a3.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061108054332/http://www.aa.psu.edu/journals/war-crimes/v1n1a3.pdf |archivedate=November 8, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bahá'ís may not teach or practice their faith or maintain links with coreligionists abroad. The fact that the [[Bahá'í World Centre|Bahá'í world headquarters]] (established by the [[Bahá'u'lláh|founder of the Bahá'í Faith]] in the 19th century, in what was then [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-controlled [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]) is situated in what is now the state of Israel, allows the Iranian government to charge the Bahá'ís with "espionage on behalf of Zionism," in particular when caught communicating with or sending monetary contributions to the Bahá'í headquarters.&lt;ref name="buck" /&gt;

Broad restrictions on Bahá'ís appear to be aimed at destroying them as a community. Bahá'ís repeatedly have been offered relief from mistreatment in exchange for recanting their faith. Bahá'í cemeteries, holy places, historical sites, administrative centers, and other assets were seized shortly after the 1979 revolution. None of the properties have been returned, and many have been destroyed.&lt;ref name="fdih1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="affolter" /&gt;

Bahá'ís are not allowed to bury and honor their dead in keeping with their religious tradition. They are permitted access only to areas of wasteland that the Government designates for their use, and are not allowed to mark the graves. Many historic Bahá'í gravesites have been desecrated or destroyed.&lt;ref name="affolter" /&gt; In 2000 in the city of Abadeh, a Revolutionary Guard officer bulldozed a Bahá'í cemetery with 22 graves.&lt;ref&gt;US State Department's Reports on Human Rights, 2001. Iran: Country Reports on Human Rights Practices (HRP 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

In what appeared to be a hopeful development, in 2002 the Government offered the Tehran community a piece of land for use as a cemetery. However, the land was in the desert, with no access to water, making it impossible to perform Bahá'í mourning rituals. In addition the Government stipulated that no markers be put on individual graves and that no mortuary facilities be built on the site, making it impossible to perform a proper burial.&lt;ref name="fdih1" /&gt;

Bahá'í group meetings and religious education, which often take place in private homes and offices, are curtailed severely. Public and private universities continue to deny admittance to Bahá'í students, a particularly demoralizing blow to a community that traditionally has placed a high value on education. Denial of access to higher education appears aimed at the eventual impoverishment of the Bahá'í community.&lt;ref name="buck" /&gt;&lt;ref name="affolter" /&gt;

Bahá'ís regularly are denied compensation for injury or criminal victimization. Government authorities claim that only Muslim plaintiffs are eligible for compensation in these circumstances.&lt;ref name="fdih1" /&gt;

In 1993, the UNSR reported the existence of a government policy directive regarding the Bahá'ís. According to the directive, the Supreme Revolutionary Council instructed government agencies to block the progress and development of the Bahá'í community, expel Bahá'í students from universities, cut Bahá'í links with groups outside the country, restrict employment of Bahá'ís, and deny Bahá'ís "positions of influence," including in education. The Government claims that the directive is a forgery. However, it appears to be an accurate reflection of current government practice designed to eradicate slowly the Bahá'í community.&lt;ref name="buck" /&gt;&lt;ref name="affolter" /&gt;

In September 2001, the Ministry of Justice issued a report that reiterated that government policy continued to aim at the eventual elimination of the Bahá'ís as a community. It stated in part that Bahá'ís would only be permitted to enroll in schools if they did not identify themselves as Bahá'ís, and that Bahá'ís preferably should be enrolled in schools that have a strong and imposing religious ideology. The report also stated that Bahá'ís must be expelled from universities, either in the admission process or during the course of their studies, once it becomes known that they are Bahá'ís.&lt;ref name="buck" /&gt;&lt;ref name="affolter" /&gt;

While in recent years the Government has eased some restrictions, thereby enabling Bahá'ís to obtain food-ration booklets and send their children to public elementary and secondary schools, the prohibition against the admission of Bahá'ís to universities remains. Thousands of Bahá'ís dismissed from government jobs in the early 1980s receive no unemployment benefits and have been required to repay the Government for salaries or pensions received from the first day of employment. Those unable to do so face prison sentences.&lt;ref name="affolter" /&gt;

Iran has taken some positive steps in recognizing the rights of Bahá'ís, as well as other religious minorities. In November 1999, [[Mohammad Khatami|President Khatami]] publicly stated that no one in the country should be persecuted because of his or her religious beliefs. He added that he would defend the civil rights of all citizens, regardless of their beliefs or religion. Subsequently, the Expediency Council approved the "Right of Citizenship" bill, affirming the social and political rights of all citizens and their equality before the law. In February 2000, following approval of the bill, the head of the judiciary issued a circular letter to all registry offices throughout the country that provided for any couple to be registered as husband and wife without being required to state their religious affiliation. The measure effectively permits the registration of Bahá'í marriages in the country. Previously Bahá'í marriages were not recognized by the Government, leaving Bahá'í women open to charges of prostitution. Thus children of Bahá'í marriages were not recognized as legitimate and therefore denied inheritance rights.&lt;ref name="buck" /&gt;

According to a U.S. panel, attacks on Bahá'ís in Iran have increased since Mahmoud Ahmadinejad became president as well as Sunni Muslims.&lt;ref name="cnn2008-05"&gt;{{cite news |title=Iran's arrest of Baha'is condemned |publisher=CNN |date=2008-05-16 |accessdate=2008-05-17 |author=CNN |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/meast/05/16/iran.bahais/}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 14, 2008, members of an informal body known as the Friends that oversaw the needs of the Bahá'í community in Iran were arrested and taken to [[Evin prison]].&lt;ref name="cnn2008-05" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=IRAN: Bahais rounded up |publisher=Los Angeles times |date=2008-05-15|first=Borzou |last=Daragahi |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/babylonbeyond/2008/05/iran-bahais-rou.html |accessdate=2008-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Officers from the Ministry of Intelligence in Tehran searched and raided the homes of the six people in the early hours of May 14.&lt;ref name="ihrdc2008"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iranhrdc.org/httpdocs/English/pdfs/PressReleases/2008/Press-05-15-08.pdf |title=IHRDC Condemns the Arrest of Leading Bahá'ís |publisher=Iran Human Rights Documentation Center |author=Iran Human Rights Documentation Center |date=2008-05-14 |accessdate=2008-05-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902191009/http://www.iranhrdc.org/httpdocs/English/pdfs/PressReleases/2008/Press-05-15-08.pdf |archive-date=2010-09-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The arrest of the six follow the detention of another Bahá'í leader in March,&lt;ref name="cnn2008-05" /&gt; who was originally taken to answer questions relating to the burial of a Bahá'i in the Bahá'í cemetery in [[Mashad]].&lt;ref name="ihrdc2008" /&gt; They have not been charged, and are prisoners of conscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde13/068/2008/en/ |title=Iran: Arbitrary arrests / Prisoners of conscience |accessdate=2008-05-18 |date=2008-05-15 |author=Amnesty International |publisher=Amnesty International}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Iran Human Rights Documentation Center has stated that they are concerned for the safety of the Bahá'ís, and that the recent events are similar to the disappearance of 25 Bahá'í leaders in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name="ihrdc2008" /&gt; The [[United States Commission on International Religious Freedom]] has stated that it fears that the "development signals a return to the darkest days of repression in Iran in the 1980s when Baha'is were routinely arrested, imprisoned, and executed."&lt;ref name="cnn2008-05" /&gt;

===Jews===
While Jews are a recognized religious minority, allegations of official discrimination are frequent. The Government's [[Anti-Zionism|anti-Israel]] policies, along with a perception among radical Muslim elements that all Jewish citizens support [[Zionism]] and the [[State of Israel]], create a threatening atmosphere for the small Jewish community. Jewish leaders reportedly are reluctant to draw attention to official mistreatment of their community due to fear of government reprisal.{{Citation needed|date = February 2007}}

Persecution and discrimination has increased among the government and society since the Revolution in 1979. On the eve of [[Passover]] 1998, 13 Iranian Jewish men were arrested on charges of espionage. The United States and Israel both demanded their release. Iran accused the men of spying for "world arrogance" (being the U.S.) and the "Zionist regime" (being Israel). The conviction is highly doubted by the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;

===Mandaeans===
According to the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights|U.N. High Commission]] for Refugees Background Paper on Iran, the Mandaeans are regarded as Christians, and are included among the country's three recognized religious minorities. However, Mandaeans regard themselves not as Christians, but as adherents of a religion that predates Christianity in both belief and practice. Mandaeans enjoyed official support as a distinct religion prior to the revolution, but their legal status as a religion since then has been the subject of debate in the Majles and never has been clarified.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

==Abuses of religious freedom==

===Baha'is===
{{Further|Persecution of Bahá'ís}}
According to the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of the United States, since 1979 more than 200 Bahá'ís have been killed and 15 have disappeared and are presumed dead. The Government continued to imprison and detain Bahá'ís based on their religious beliefs.&lt;ref name="affolter" /&gt;

The Government appears to adhere to a practice of keeping a small number of Bahá'ís in arbitrary detention, some at risk of execution, at any given time. There were four Bahá'ís reported to be in prison for practicing their faith at the end of the period covered by this report, two facing life sentences and two facing sentences of 15 years. In addition the Government appears to engage in harassment of the Bahá'í community by arresting Bahá'ís arbitrarily, charging them, and then releasing them, often without dropping the charges against them. Those with charges still pending against them fear arrest at any time.&lt;ref name="fdih1" /&gt;

Two Bahá'ís, Sirus Zabihi-Moghaddam and Hadayat Kashefi-Najafabadi, were tried in 1998 and later sentenced to death by an [[Islamic Revolutionary Court]] in Mashad for practicing their faith. In 2000 the sentences were reduced to 7 and 5 years respectively. Kashefi-Najafabadi was released in October 2001, after serving 4 years of his sentence. Zabihi-Moghaddam, who originally was arrested in November 1997, was released in June 2002.&lt;ref name="state2002"&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2002/13995.htm | title= International Religious Freedom Report |author=Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor |publisher=U.S. Department of State |date=2002-10-07 |accessdate=2006-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Government continued to imprison and detain Bahá'ís based on their religious beliefs. Manuchehr Khulusi was arrested in June 1999 while visiting fellow Bahá'ís in the town of [[Birjand]], and was imprisoned until his release in May 2000. During his imprisonment, Khulusi was interrogated, beaten, held in solitary confinement, and denied access to his lawyer. The charges brought against him remain unknown, but they were believed to be related to his faith. The [[Islamic Revolutionary Court]] in Mashhad held a 2-day trial in September 1999 and sentenced Khulusi to death in February 2000. Despite Khulusi's release, it is unclear if the conviction and death sentence against him still stand.&lt;ref name="state2002" /&gt;

The property rights of Bahá'ís generally are disregarded. Since 1979 large numbers of private and business properties belonging to Bahá'ís have been confiscated. During the period covered by this report, 14 Bahá'í homes were seized and handed over to an agency of [[Ali Khamenei|Supreme Leader Khamenei]]. Authorities reportedly confiscated Bahá'í properties in Kata and forced several families to leave their homes and farmlands. Authorities also imprisoned some farmers, and did not permit others to harvest their crops. In 2000 authorities in Tehran, [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]], and [[Shiraz, Iran|Shiraz]] reportedly also confiscated eight buildings belonging to Bahá'ís. In one instance, a woman from Isfahan who legally traveled abroad found that her home had been confiscated when she returned home. During the period covered by the report, the Government also seized private homes in which Bahá'í youth classes were held despite the owners having proper ownership documents. In 1999 three Bahá'í homes in Yazd and one in Arbakan were confiscated because their owners were Bahá'ís. The Government's seizure of Bahá'í personal property, as well as its denial of Bahá'í access to education and employment, are eroding the economic base of the Bahá'í community.&lt;ref name="fdih1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="affolter" /&gt;

In 1998, after a nationwide raid of more than 500 Bahá'í homes and offices, as well as numerous arrests, the authorities closed the Bahá'í Institute of Higher Learning. Also known as the "Open University," the Institute was established by the Bahá'í community shortly after the revolution to offer higher educational opportunities to Bahá'í students who had been denied access to the country's high schools and universities. The Institute remains closed.&lt;ref name="buck" /&gt;&lt;ref name="affolter" /&gt;

It has become somewhat easier for Bahá'ís to obtain passports in order to travel abroad. In addition some Iranian embassies abroad do not require applicants to state a religious affiliation. In such cases, it is easier for Bahá'ís to renew passports. Nevertheless, in February 2001, the Government denied visas to foreigners in the Bahá'í delegation to the Asia-Pacific Regional Preparatory Conference for the World Conference on Racism, held in Tehran.

Furthermore, a confidential letter sent on October 29, 2005 by the Chairman of the Command Headquarters of the Armed Forced in Iran states that the Supreme Leader of Iran, [[Ali Khamenei|Ayatollah Khamenei]] has instructed the Command Headquarters to identify people who adhere to the Bahá'í Faith and to monitor their activities and gather any and all information about the members of the Bahá'í Faith. The letter was brought to the attention of the international community by Asma Jahangir, the Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights on freedom of religion or belief, in a March 20, 2006 press release.&lt;ref name=UNPR-1&gt;

In the press release the Special Rapporteur states that she "is highly concerned by information she has received concerning the treatment of members of the Bahá'í community in Iran."  She further states that "The Special Rapporteur is concerned that this latest development indicates that the situation with regard to religious minorities in Iran is, in fact, deteriorating."&lt;ref name=UNPR-1/&gt;

For example, [[Youcef Nadarkhani]] is an Jammiat-e Rabbani (Christian) pastor who was given a death sentence for apostasy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Iranian Pastor Youcef Nadarkhani's potential execution rallies U.S. Christians |first= Adelle M. |last= Banks |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/on-faith/us-christians-rally-around-iranian-pastor/2011/09/28/gIQA11YJ5K_story.html |newspaper= [[The Washington Post]] |date= 2011-09-28 |accessdate= 2011-10-05 |quote= Religious freedom advocates rallied Wednesday (Sept. 28) around an Iranian pastor who is facing execution because he has refused to recant his Christian faith in the overwhelmingly Muslim country. }}{{dead link|date=June 2018}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt; though eventually he was released after winning an appeal.

Some issues dealing with Christianity in Iran deal more directly with the Armenian ethnic minorities. For example, in early 1983 the MET specifically requested that the [[Armenians|Armenian]] religious schools teach religion in Persian and time allocated to the Armenian languages must be reduced or eliminated.&lt;ref name="Sanas2000" /&gt; While the community responded to these orders issues raised in discussions included if the Armenians could speak/teach their own language other minorities would demand the same but also if Persian was used it would make proselytization easier as facility with Persian language use of religious issues improved. At the end of the 1983 academic year the MET requested the questions that were to be included in the final exam and the questions had to be sent in Persian and were ordered to be used in Persian as the final exam. Most fifth grade students refused to take the test and 3rd grade students handed in blank pages. The authorities then failed all the students. Some schools ignored the demands on languages, others did limit teaching to 2 hrs and others removed it entirely.&lt;ref name="Sanas2000" /&gt; Some continued religious classes and some dropped them all together. Observance of these rules on Armenian language teaching was most strict in Tehran while 6 to 8 hrs per week were common beyond. However, in 1995 the limit on languages was raised from 2 hrs to 5 hrs per week in Tehran as well.&lt;ref name="Sanas2000" /&gt; Circa 1996 a settlement was reached; during the first two months of each school year, the ministry-provided Persian book on religious ethics is taught in Armenian schools while Armenian-approved religious lessons are taught in Armenian for the rest of the year. This was not a totally satisfactory settlement of the issue for both sides, but it settled the issue.&lt;ref name="UNHCR-Armenia" /&gt;

In 1976, the Christian population numbered 168,593 people, mostly [[Iranian Armenians|Armenians]]. Due to the [[Iran–Iraq War]] in the 1980s and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in the 1990s, almost half of the Armenians migrated to the newly independent [[Armenia]]. However, the opposite trend has occurred since 2000, and the number of Christians with Iranian citizenship increased to 109,415 in 2006 and 117,704 in 2011. According national Statistical centre Christians were fastest growing religion in Iran during 1996-2006 period (+38.9%), and second fastest during 2006-2011 period (+7.6%, after Zoroastrianism). At the same time, significant immigration of [[Assyrians in Iraq|Assyrians]] from [[Iraq]] has been recorded due to massacres and harassment in [[Iraq under U.S. Military Occupation|post-Saddam Iraq]]. However, most of those [[Assyrians in Iran]] do not have Iranian citizenship. In 2008, the central office of the International Union of Assyrians, a mistranslation in the Iranian press for the Assyrian Universal Alliance,  was officially transferred to Iran after being hosted in the United States for more than four decades.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Tehran Times]]'', [http://old.tehrantimes.com/index_View.asp?code=180160 "Assyrians' central office officially transferred to Iran"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150331174726/http://old.tehrantimes.com/index_View.asp?code=180160 |date=2015-03-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jews===
In 1984 the government began to request religious affiliation on questionnaires for passports.&lt;ref name="Sanas2000"/&gt; In contrast to other registered religious minorities starting in 1983, Jewish families were prevented from traveling as a group and if one member of the family traveled then another family member's passport was held. Regardless, thousands of Jews had emigrated in the first eight months of 1987 through Austria. Perhaps half the Jews left Iran leaving about 30,000 Jews by 1986. Some may have returned in the late 1980s. Generally the overall economic position has deteriorated significantly post revolution.&lt;ref name="Sanas2000"/&gt;

It is estimated that a minimum of 13 Jews have been executed by Iran since the country's revolution. Of them include two men (not of the ones written above) hanged in 1997 for allegedly spying for Israel and the United States; as well as businessman Ruhollah Kadkhodah-Zadeh who was hanged in prison without a public charge or legal proceeding, apparently for assisting Jews to emigrate.&lt;ref&gt;

===Shia===
The Special Clerical Court (SCC) system, established in 1987 to investigate offenses and crimes committed by clerics and which the Supreme Leader oversees directly, is not provided for in the constitution and operates outside the domain of the judiciary. In particular, critics alleged that the clerical courts were used to prosecute certain clerics for expressing controversial ideas and for participating in activities outside the area of religion, including journalism.&lt;ref name=2006Report/&gt;

During the latter part of 2000, a Special Clerical Court began the trial of Hojatoleslam Hassan Yousefi Eshkevari, a cleric who participated in a conference in Berlin on Iran, on charges of apostasy, "corruption on earth," "declaring war on God," and "denial of basic religious principles," which potentially carry the death penalty. Eshkevari has called for more liberal interpretations of Islamic law in certain areas. The verdict was not announced, but, according to [[Amnesty International]], Eshkevari widely was reported to have been sentenced to death. In November 2001, following domestic and international criticism, his sentence reportedly was reduced to 30 months' imprisonment and removal of his status as a cleric.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} On February 6, 2005, the special clerical court agreed to his conditional release (parole); he had served two thirds of his seven-year sentence and was therefore eligible for parole under the law.&lt;ref name=2006Report/&gt;

Independent newspapers and magazines have been closed, and leading publishers and journalists were imprisoned on charges of hate speech and "insulting Islam" and sparking revolutionary sentiments whilst "calling into question the Islamic foundation of the Republic."&lt;ref name=2006Report/&gt; In 2002 academic Hashem Aghajari was sentenced to death for blasphemy against the Prophet Muhammed, based on a speech in which he challenged Muslims not to blindly follow the clergy, provoking an international and domestic outcry.&lt;ref name=2006Report/&gt;

In 2003 his death sentence was revoked by the Supreme Court, but the case was sent back to the lower court for retrial. He was retried on charges that did include revolutionary incitement and was sentenced to five years' imprisonment, two of which were suspended, and five years of additional "deprivation of social right" (meaning that he could not teach or write books or articles). His time served was counted towards his three-year sentence; the court converted the remainder of the time to a fine. He was released on bail in 2004.&lt;ref name=2006Report/&gt;

Late November, 2018 prison warden Qarchak women prison in Varamin, near the capital Tehran attacked and bit three [[Dervish]] religious minority prisoners when they demanded their confiscated belongings back.&lt;ref&gt;[https://iran-hrm.com/index.php/2018/11/27/gonabadi-dervish-women-brutally-beaten-up-in-qarchak-prison/ Gonabadi Dervish Women Brutally Beaten Up In Qarchak PrisonBy Iran HRM  Last updated Nov 27, 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zoroastrians===
{{Further|Persecution of Zoroastrians}}
Zoroastrian served as the national- or state religion of a significant portion of the Iranian people for many centuries before it was gradually marginalized by Islam from the 7th century onwards. The political power of the pre-Islamic Iranian dynasties lent Zoroastrians immense prestige in ancient times, and some of its leading doctrines were adopted by other religious systems.

There are no official reports of government harassment of the Zoroastrian community to date. Unofficial reports of discrimination in employment and education has come up, but are by no means frequent. Zoroastrians are free to make, without government interference, their annual pilgrimage to one of the holiest sites of their faith, the temple of Chak-Chak (near the city of Yazd).&lt;ref name = 2006Report/&gt;

==Societal attitudes==
The continuous activity of the country's pre-Islamic, non-Muslim communities, such as Zoroastrians, Jews, and Christians, has accustomed the population to the presence of non-Muslims in society. However, actions of the conservative parts of society and the government create a threatening atmosphere for some religious minorities. For a Christian, Jew or Zoroastrian there is constant pressure at school to convert.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Boxer, "Iran Tries To Convert Jewish Students", The Jewish Week, August 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jewish community has been reduced to less than one-half of its prerevolutionary size. Some of this emigration is connected with the larger, general waves of departures following the establishment of the Islamic Republic, but some also stems from continued perceived anti-Semitism on the part of the government and within society.&lt;ref name=2006Report/&gt;
&lt;!--
The government’s anti-Israel policies, along with the perception among some of the country’s radicalized elements that Iranian Jews support Zionism and the State of Israel, created a threatening atmosphere for the Jewish community (see Section II). Many Jews have sought to limit their contact with or support for the State of Israel out of fear of reprisal. Recent anti-American and anti-Israeli demonstrations have included the denunciation of "Jews," as opposed to the past practice of denouncing only "Israel" and "Zionism," adding to the threatening atmosphere for the community.
cite needed - replaced with the following paragraph
--&gt;

The government's anti-Israel policies, along with a perception among radical Muslims that all Jewish citizens supported Zionism and the state of Israel, created a hostile atmosphere for the small community. For example, in 2005 many newspapers celebrated the one-hundredth anniversary of the anti-Semitic publication Protocols of the Elders of Zion. Jewish leaders reportedly were reluctant to draw attention to official mistreatment of their community due to fear of government reprisal.&lt;ref name=2006Report/&gt;

The '''''Grimoire of Armadel''''' (original title: ''Liber Armadel seu totius cabalae perfectissima brevissima et infallabilis scientia tam speculativa quam practiqua'') is a minor 17th-century French Christian [[grimoire]] kept in the [[Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal]]. It was translated into English by [[S.L. MacGregor Mathers]],&lt;ref&gt;The Grimoire of Armadel S. L. MacGregor Mathers, William Keith "Translated from a 17th-century manuscript stored in Paris, this is an ancient but still useful book of popularized Christian magic. It is illustrated with intricate sigils. Original Language: French, Latin"&lt;/ref&gt; and first published in 1980 after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=S. L.

==History of similarities and differences==
Scholars state that the origins of Sikhism were influenced by the ''nirguni'' (formless God) tradition of [[Bhakti movement]] in medieval India.&lt;ref&gt;David Lorenzen (1995), Bhakti Religion in North India: Community Identity and Political Action, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791420256}}, pages 1-2, Quote: "Historically, Sikh religion derives from this nirguni current of bhakti religion"&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref name=encyclobritannicasikh/&gt; The roots of the Sikh tradition perhaps in the [[Sant (religion)|Sant]]-tradition of India whose ideology grew to become the Bhakti tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Fenech (2014), in The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies (Editors: Pashaura Singh, Louis E. Fenech), Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199699308}}, page 35, Quote: "Technically this would place the Sikh community's origins at a much further remove than 1469, perhaps to the dawning of the Sant movement, which possesses clear affinities to Guru Nanak's thought sometime in the tenth century. The predominant ideology of the Sant ''parampara'' in turn corresponds in many respects to the much wider devotional Bhakti tradition in northern India."&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, "Indic mythology permeates the Sikh sacred canon, the ''Guru Granth Sahib'' and the secondary canon, the ''Dasam Granth'' and adds delicate nuance and substance to the sacred symbolic universe of the Sikhs of today and of their past ancestors".&lt;ref&gt;Louis Fenech (2014), in The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies (Editors: Pashaura Singh, Louis E. Fenech), Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199699308}}, page 36, Quote: "Few Sikhs would mention these Indic texts and ideologies in the same breadth as the Sikh tradition, let alone trace elements of their tradition to this chronological and ideological point, despite the fact that the Indic mythology permeates the Sikh sacred canon, the ''Guru Granth Sahib'' and the secondary canon, the ''Dasam Granth'' (Rinehart 2011), and adds delicate nuance and substance to the sacred symbolic universe of the Sikhs of today and of their past ancestors."&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ik Onkar'', iconically represented as {{lang|pa|ੴ}} in the [[Guru Granth Sahib|Sri Guru Granth Sahib]] (although sometimes spelt out in full as {{lang|pa|ਏਕੰਕਾਰੁ}}) is the iconographic statement in Sikhism that is 'there is one God'.&lt;ref name=wazirsingh&gt;{{cite book|title=Aspects of Guru Nanak's philosophy | first=Wazir | last=Singh | year=1969 | publisher=Lahore Book Shop | page=20 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rWM9AAAAIAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=substitute+ekankar | isbn= | accessdate=2015-09-17 | quote="the 'a,' 'u,' and 'm' of aum have also been explained as signifying the three principles of creation, sustenance and annihilation. ... aumkār in relation to existence implies plurality,  ... but its substitute Ekonkar definitely implies singularity in spite of the seeming multiplicity of existence. ..."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Sikhism&gt;{{cite book |author = Singh, Khushwant| authorlink = Khushwant Singh| chapter=The Sikhs| chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=5LSvkQvvmAMC&amp;pg=PA114&amp; |editor=Kitagawa, Joseph Mitsuo |title=The religious traditions of Asia: religion, history, and culture |publisher=RoutledgeCurzon |location=London |year=2002 |page=114 |isbn=0-7007-1762-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |editor-link= Joseph Kitagawa|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase is an expression of monotheistic unity of God.&lt;ref name="M-W Ik Onkar"&gt;{{cite book | title=Merriam-Webster's encyclopedia of world religions | last=Doniger | first=Wendy | year=1999 | publisher=Merriam-Webster | page=500 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZP_f9icf2roC&amp;pg=PA500&amp;dq=%22ik+oankar%22&amp;ct=result#v=onepage&amp;q=%22ik%20oankar%22&amp;f=false | accessdate=2015-09-23 | isbn=978-0-87779-044-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Onkar'' in ({{large|ੴ}}) of Sikhism is related to ''Om'' ({{large|ॐ}}) of Hinduism.&lt;ref name="M-W Ik Onkar"/&gt; Some Sikhs disagree that ''Ik Onkar'' is same as ''Om''.&lt;ref name="M-W Ik Onkar"/&gt; Onkar is, states Wazir Singh, a "variation of Om (Aum) of the ancient Indian scriptures (with a slight change in its orthography), implying the seed-force that evolves as the universe".&lt;ref&gt;Wazir Singh (1969), Guru Nanak's philosophy, Journal of Religious Studies, Vol. 1, Issue 1, page 56&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Ek Onkar'', explains Gulati, "Ek" means One, and Onkar is "equivalent of the Hindu "Om" (Aum)".&lt;ref name=gulati285&gt;Mahinder Gulati (2008), Comparative Religious And Philosophies : Anthropomorphlsm And Divinity, Atlantic, {{ISBN|978-8126909025}}, pages 284-285; Quote: "While Ek literally means One, Onkar is the equivalent of the Hindu "Om" (Aum), the one syllable sound representing the holy trinity of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva - the God in His entirety."&lt;/ref&gt;

However, both of them are different as far as sikhs believe because Oankar refers to the total primary lord God.

&lt;poem&gt;
''Oankar'' ('the Primal Sound') created [[Brahma]], ''Oankar'' fashioned the consciousness,
From ''Oankar'' came mountains and ages, ''Oankar'' produced the [[Vedas]],
By the grace of ''Oankar'', people were saved through the divine word,
By the grace of ''Oankar'', they were liberated through the teachings of the Guru.

===Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji===

During the Mughal Empire period, the Sikh and Hindu traditions believe that Sikhs helped protect Hindus from Islamic persecution, and this caused martyrdom of their Guru.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Mir | first=Farina | title=The social space of language vernacular culture in British colonial Punjab | publisher=University of California Press | location=Berkeley | year=2010 | isbn=978-0-520-26269-0 | pages=207–237}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sikh historians, for example, record that the Sikh movement was rapidly growing in northwest India, and [[Guru Tegh Bahadur]] Ji was openly encouraging Sikhs to, "be fearless in their pursuit of just society: he who holds none in fear, nor is afraid of anyone, is acknowledged as a man of true wisdom", a statement recorded in Adi Granth 1427.&lt;ref name=cs2013&gt;{{cite book | last=Seiple | first=Chris | title=The Routledge handbook of religion and security | publisher=Routledge | location=New York | year=2013 | isbn=978-0-415-66744-9 | page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pslf/&gt;&lt;ref name=sg2007/&gt; While Guru Tegh Bahadur influence was rising, Aurangzeb had imposed Islamic laws, demolished Hindu schools and temples, and enforced new taxes on non-Muslims.&lt;ref name=pslf/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbcgtb&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/sikhism/people/teghbahadur.shtml Guru Tegh Bahadur] BBC Religions (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nsxviii&gt;{{cite book | author=Gobind Singh (Translated by Navtej Sarna) | title=Zafarnama | publisher=Penguin Books | year=2011 | isbn=978-0-670-08556-9 | page=xviii-xix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences==
===Monotheism versus pluralism===
Sikhism is a monotheistic religion; Sikhs believe there is only one God, who has infinite qualities and names. According to Eleanor Nesbitt, English renderings of Sikhism as a monotheistic religion "tend misleadingly to reinforce a Semitic understanding of monotheism, rather than Guru Nanak's mystical awareness of the one that is expressed through the many. However, what is not in doubt is the emphasis on 'one'".&lt;ref name="Nesbitt2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nesbitt|first=Eleanor M.|title=Sikhism: a very short introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fvTK_CfkeasC|year = 2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-280601-7|pages=21–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hinduism is a diverse system of thought with beliefs spanning monotheism, polytheism, panentheism, pantheism, monism, agnosticism, deism and atheism.&lt;ref&gt;Julius J. Lipner (2009), Hindus: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices, 2nd Edition, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-415-45677-7}}, page 8; Quote: "(...) one need not be religious in the minimal sense described to be accepted as a Hindu by Hindus, or describe oneself perfectly validly as Hindu. One may be polytheistic or monotheistic, monistic or pantheistic, even an agnostic, humanist or atheist, and still be considered a Hindu."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Caste System===
Hinduism splits people into [[Varna (Hinduism)|4 groups]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dumont|first1=Louis|title=Homo Hierarchicus: The Caste System and Its Implications|date=1980|isbn=9780226169637|page=437}}&lt;/ref&gt; namely [[Brahmin]], [[Kshatriya]], [[Vaishyas]] and [[Shudras]]. But the terms ''varna'' (theoretical classification based on occupation) and ''jāti'' (caste) are two distinct concepts. Jāti (community) refers to the thousands of [[Endogamous group|endogamous groups]] prevalent across the subcontinent. A jati may be divided into [[Exogamous group|exogamous groups]] based on the same [[gotras]]. The classical authors scarcely speak of anything other than the varnas; even Indologists sometimes confuse the two.

Sikhism treats all people equally and founds systems such as [[Langar (Sikhism)|Langar]] and [[Pangat]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rait|first1=S. K.|title=Sikh Women in England: Their Religious and Cultural Beliefs and Social Practices|date=2005|publisher=Trentham Books|isbn=9781858563534|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; to help play this out in daily life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dhillon|first1=Dalbir|title=Sikhism Origin and Development|date=1988|publisher=Atlantic|location=New Delhi|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Once a person initiates into the [[Khalsa]] (Sikh Baptism) it is said that they no longer belong to any caste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Saran|first1=Gursaran|title=The Wheel Eternaln|date=2013|publisher=Dorrance Publishing|location=Pittsburgh|isbn=9781434969002|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This, however, does not imply that the practice of caste hierarchy is absent within the adherents of Sikhism. Caste hierarchy is generally a social reality within the Indian subcontinent regardless of religious affiliation.

====Vedantic Philosophy for all Castes====
[[Guru Gobind Singh]] founded the [[Nirmala (sect)|Nirmale]] school to help teach [[Sanskrit]] and classical [[Hindu literature]], which was then was primarily only available to the higher caste Brahmins,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dhavan|first1=Purima|title=When Sparrows Became Hawks: The Making of the Sikh Warrior Tradition, 1699-1799 221|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-975655-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Guru in this way translated many Hindu works into Punjabi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Seetal|first1=Sohan|title=Prophet of Man, Guru Gobind Singh|publisher=Lyall Book Depot|page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rituals===
Sikhs believe in ''naam jap'' (meditation), and focus on listening to the hymns from [[Guru Granth Sahib]], the central religious scripture of Sikh faith. The Guru is the focal point of worship in any Sikh ''[[Gurdwara]]'', and the worshippers bow before it. Guru Granth Sahib is installed every morning and put to bed at night in many ''Gurdwaras''.&lt;ref&gt;William Owen Cole and Piara Singh Sambhi (1995), The Sikhs: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices, Sussex Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-1898723134}}, page 44&lt;/ref&gt;

Different schools of Hinduism have different theories about rituals&lt;ref&gt;[a] Karl Potter (2008), Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies Vol. III, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120803107}}, pages 16-18, 220; [b] Basant Pradhan (2014), Yoga and Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy, Springer Academic, {{ISBN|978-3319091044}}, page 13 see A.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christian Novetzke (2007), Bhakti and Its Public, International Journal of Hindu Studies, Vol. 11, No. 3, page 255-272&lt;/ref&gt; and on salvation ([[moksha]]).&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Fort (1998), Jivanmukti in Transformation, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791439043}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they are primarily based around Puja (devotional worship to a personal deity, often using an idol or Murthi), and Yajna (ritual non-human/non-animal sacrifice).

===Idol worship===
{{Main|Idolatry in Sikhism}}
Sikhs shun idol worship as a part of their faith.&lt;ref&gt;Pashaura Singh (2014), in The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies (Editors: Pashaura Singh, Louis E. Fenech), Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199699308}}, page 131&lt;/ref&gt;

Hindus accept the worship facilitated with images or ''[[murti]]''s (idols), particularly in [[Agama (Hinduism)|Agamic]] traditions, such as [[Vaishnavism]] and [[Shaivism]].&lt;ref&gt;V Bharne and K Krusche (2012), Rediscovering the Hindu Temple: The Sacred Architecture and Urbanism of India, Cambridge Scholars Publishing, {{ISBN|978-1443841375}}, pages 37-42&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars state it is incorrect to state that all Hindus worship idols, and more correct to state that for some the idol is a means to focus their thoughts, for some idol is a manifestation of spirituality that is everywhere, and for some even a [[linga]], a sunrise or a river or a flower  serves the same purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Jeaneane Fowler (1996), Hinduism: Beliefs and Practices, Sussex Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-1898723608}}, pages 41-43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swarup Chandra (1998), Encyclopaedia of Hindu Gods and Goddesses, Swarup &amp; Sons, {{ISBN|978-8176250399}}, page 149&lt;/ref&gt; Hindu temples are called [[Mandirs]], while Sikh temples are called [[Gurudwaras|Gurdwaras]]. However, the most famous Sikh shrine is called Hari Mandir.

===Soteriology===
The [[Sikh]] concept of salvation is similar to some schools of Hinduism, and it is called mukti (moksha) referring to spiritual liberation.&lt;ref name=teece17/&gt; It is described in Sikhism as the state that breaks the cycle of rebirths.&lt;ref name=teece17&gt;Geoff Teece (2004), Sikhism: Religion in focus, {{ISBN|978-1-58340-469-0}}, page 17&lt;/ref&gt; Mukti is obtained according to Sikhism, states Singha, through "God's grace".&lt;ref name=hssingha54&gt;HS Singha (2009),Sikhism: A Complete Introduction, Hemkunt Press, {{ISBN|978-8170102458}}, pages 53-54&lt;/ref&gt; In the teachings of the Sikh scripture Guru Granth Sahib, the devotion to God is viewed as more important than the desire for ''Mukti''.&lt;ref name=hssingha54/&gt;

{{Quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
I desire neither worldly power nor liberation. I desire nothing but seeing the Lord.
[[Brahma]], [[Shiva]], the [[Siddha]]s, the silent sages and [[Indra]] - I seek only the Blessed Vision of my Lord and Master's Darshan.
I have come, helpless, to Your Door, O Lord Master; I am exhausted - I seek the Sanctuary of the Saints.
Says [[Guru Nanak|Nanak]], I have met my Enticing Lord God; my mind is cooled and soothed - it blossoms forth in joy.
&lt;/poem&gt;
|[[Guru Granth Sahib]]|P534&lt;ref name=hssingha54/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.srigurugranth.org/0534.html Guru Granth Sahib] P534, 2.3.29&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Sikhism recommends [[Naam Japo|Naam Simran]] as the way to mukti, which is meditating.&lt;ref name=teece17/&gt;&lt;ref name=hssingha54/&gt;

The six major orthodox schools of [[Hindu philosophy]] offer diverse [[Soteriology|soteriological]] views on [[moksha]], including whether moksha can be achieved in this life, or after this life.&lt;ref name=asharma&gt;A. Sharma (2000), Classical Hindu Thought: An Introduction, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195644418}}, pp 117&lt;/ref&gt; The Nyaya, Vaisesika and Mimamsa schools of Hinduism consider moksha as possible only after death.&lt;ref name=asharma/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note: Each school has a different meaning for Moksha. For example, Mimamsa school considers moksha as release into ''svarga'' (heaven), it does not recognize samsara; while Nyaya school considers moksha as linked to samsara and a release from it; See: [[:iarchive:mimamsasutra00jaimuoft|The Purva-Mimamsa Sutra of Jaimini]], Transl: M.L. Sandal (1923), Chapter II, Pada I and Chapter VI, Pada I through VIII; Also see Klaus Klostermaier, A Survey of Hinduism, 3rd Edition, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-7082-4}}, Chapter 26&lt;/ref&gt; Samkhya and Yoga schools consider moksha as possible in this life. In Vedanta school, the Advaita sub-school concludes moksha is possible in this life.&lt;ref name=asharma/&gt; The Dvaita and Visistadvaita sub-schools of Vedanta tradition, highlighted by many poet-saints of the [[Bhakti movement]], believe that moksha is a continuous event, one assisted by loving devotion to God, that extends from this life to post-mortem. Beyond these six orthodox schools, some heterodox schools of Hindu tradition, such as Carvaka, deny there is a soul or after life moksha.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, A. T. (2013), A review of "An Introduction to Indian Philosophy: Perspectives on Reality, Knowledge, and Freedom", Religion, 43(1), pages 119-123&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dietary requirements===
Hinduism does not explicitly prohibit eating meat, but it does strongly recommend [[Ahimsa]] – the concept of non-violence against all life forms including animals.&lt;ref name=dudek251&gt;Susan Dudek (2013), Nutrition Essentials for Nursing Practice, Wolters Kluwer Health, {{ISBN|978-1451186123}}, page 251&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Angela Wood (1998), Movement and Change, Nelson Thornes, {{ISBN|978-0174370673}}, page 80&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, many Hindus prefer vegetarian or lacto-vegetarian lifestyle, and methods of food production that is in harmony with nature and compassionate, respectful of other life forms as well as nature.&lt;ref name=dudek251/&gt;

The tenets of [[Sikhism]] do not advocate a particular stance on either vegetarianism&lt;ref name="Historyof"&gt;A History of the Sikh People by Dr. Gopal Singh, World Sikh University Press, Delhi {{ISBN|9788170231394}} ''However, it is strange that nowadays in the Community-Kitchen attached to the Sikh temples, and called the Guru's Kitchen (or, Guru-ka-langar) meat-dishes are not served at all. May be, it is on account of its being, perhaps, expensive, or not easy to keep for long. Or, perhaps the Vaishnava tradition is too strong to be shaken off.''&lt;/ref&gt; or the consumption of meat,&lt;ref name="Historyof" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Guru Granth Sahib, An Analytical Study by Surindar Singh Kohli, Singh Bros. Amritsar {{ISBN|8172050607}}  ''The ideas of devotion and service in Vaishnavism have been accepted by Adi Granth, but the insistence of Vaishnavas on vegetarian diet has been rejected.''&lt;/ref&gt; but rather leave the decision of diet to the individual. Sikh sects and groups that have a "Vashnavite" influence (AKJ, GNNSJ, 3HO, Namdhari's etc.) tend to be vegetarians.&lt;ref name="Historyof"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Other Sikhs eat meat that has been prepared by the [[Jhatka]] method (meat prepared by sudden death of the animal), and consider only that meat as expressly forbidden that is ritually slaughtered like [[Kosher]] or [[Halal]] ([[Kutha meat]], the meat of animals prepared by slowly bleeding it to death). HS Singha explains the [[Jhatka]] meat requirement to have support in the Hindu tradition as well, as follows,

{{Quote|
According to the ancient Aryan Hindu tradition, only such meat as is obtained from an animal which is killed with one stroke of the weapon causing instantaneous death is fit for human consumption. However, with the coming of Islam into India and the Muslim political hegemony, it became a state policy not to permit slaughter of animals for food, in any other manner, except as laid down in the Quran - the halal meat prepared by severing the main blood artery of the throat of the animal while reciting verses from the Quran. Guru Gobind Singh took a rather serious view of this aspect of the whole matter. He, therefore, while permitting flesh to be taken as food repudiated the whole theory of this expiatory sacrifice and the right of ruling Muslims to impose it on the non-Muslims. Accordingly, he made jhatka meat obligatory for those Sikhs who may be interested in taking meat as a part of their food.

In the Hindu and Sikh traditions, there is a distinction between religion and culture, and ethical decisions are grounded in both religious beliefs and cultural values. Both Hindu and Sikh ethics are primarily duty based. Traditional teachings deal with the duties of individuals and families to maintain a lifestyle conducive to physical, mental and spiritual health. These traditions share a culture and world view that includes ideas of karma and rebirth, collective versus individual identity, and a strong emphasis on spiritual purity.[http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/163/9/1167]

The notion of [[dharma]], [[karma]], [[moksha]] are very important for both Hindus and Sikhs. Unlike the linear view of life, death, heaven or hell taken in [[Abrahamic]] religions, for Hindus and Sikhs believe in the concept of [[Saṃsāra]], that is life, birth and death are repeated, for each soul, in a cycle until one reaches mukti or [[moksha]].&lt;ref name=colesambhi13&gt;{{cite book|author1=W.O.

==Culture and intermarriage==
There is an organic relation of Sikhs to Hindus, states Zaehner, both in religious thought and their communities, and virtually all Sikhs' ancestors were Hindus.&lt;ref name=robertzaehner/&gt; Some Hindus view Sikhism as a tradition within Hinduism (such as some Hindus referring to Sikhs as [[Keshdhari Hindus]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Mukul Kesavan|title=Their better selves - Vegetarianism and virtue|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/1150914/jsp/opinion/story_42418.jsp#.Vp8uN-asif8|accessdate=4 July 2017|work=The Telegraph|date=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though the Sikh faith is a distinct religion.&lt;ref name=robertzaehner&gt;Robert Zaehner (1997), Encyclopedia of the World's Religions, Barnes &amp; Noble Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0760707128}}, page 409&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, Sikhs were seen as the protectors of Hindus and were even considered the "sword arm" of Hinduism.&lt;ref name="mehta" &gt;{{cite book|author1=Ved Mehta| authorlink = Ved Mehta | title=Rajiv Gandhi and Rama's Kingdom|date=1996|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300068580|page=65|edition=illustrated, revised}}&lt;/ref&gt; This status as protectors of Hindus was strong enough that Punjabi Hindus would often raise their eldest son as a Sikh.&lt;ref name="mehta" /&gt;

Marriages between Sikhs and Hindus, particularly among ''Khatris'', are frequent.&lt;ref name=robertzaehner/&gt; Dogra states that there has always been inter-marriage between the Hindu and the Sikh communities.&lt;ref&gt;R. C. Dogra &amp; Urmila Dogra: ''Hindu and Sikh wedding ceremonies'' pub. 2000. Star Publications. {{ISBN|9788176500289}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Charing and Cole state that "Sikhism originated and developed within Hinduism. Hindus and Sikhs, in initial years of Sikhism, used to have what is termed as ''Roti Beti di Sanjh''; that is they eat together and intermarry".&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Charing and William Owen Cole: ''Six world faiths'' pub. 2004, page 309. Continuum International Publishing Group. {{ISBN|9780826476838}}.&lt;/ref&gt; William Owen Cole and Piara Singh Sambhi state that for some Sikhs, intermarriage between Hindus and Sikhs of same community was preferable than other communities.&lt;ref&gt;William Owen Cole, Piara Singh Sambhi: Sikhism and Christianity: a comparative study, Volume 1993, Part 2, pub. 1993. Macmillan. Page 22. {{ISBN|9780333541067}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, Sikh scriptures were treated as part of the corpus of the sacred writing of Hindus.&lt;ref name="mehta" /&gt;

'''Huqúqu'lláh''' ({{lang-ar|ﺣﻘﻮﻕ ﺍﻟﻠﻪ}}, "Right of God"), sometimes called the '''Law of Huqúq''' is a [[Socioeconomics|socio-economic]] and [[Spirituality|spiritual]] law of the [[Kitáb-i-Aqdas]], a charter document of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], written by [[Bahá'u'lláh]]. In its most basic form, it states that Bahá'ís should make a 19% voluntary payment on any wealth in excess of what is necessary to live comfortably, after the remittance of any outstanding debt. The money is then disbursed to social and economic development projects, or similar [[Philanthropy|philanthropic]] purposes.

==History==

===Gradual implementation===
:''See also: [[Bahá'í laws#Gradualism|Gradualism in Bahá'í laws]]'' and ''[[Timeline of the institution of Huqúqu'lláh]]''
Bahá'u'lláh wrote down the law of Huqúqu'lláh in the [[Kitáb-i-Aqdas]] in 1873, but he did not accept any payments initially. In 1878 he appointed the first trustee of the Huqúqu'lláh, who had the responsibility of receiving the ''Huqúq'' from the Bahá'ís in [[Iran]]. Later this was expanded to the Bahá'ís of the [[Middle East]]. In 1985 information about the ''Huqúq'' was distributed worldwide and in 1992 the law was made universally applicable. As the number of payments increased, deputies and representatives to receive the payments have been appointed. In 1991 the central office of Huqúqu'lláh was established at the [[Bahá'í World Centre]] in [[Haifa]], [[Israel]].&lt;ref name="Cambridge"&gt;{{Cite book|last = Smith|first = Peter|year = 2008 |title = An Introduction to the Baha'i Faith|publisher = Cambridge University Press|place = Cambridge| pages=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= Huqúqu'lláh |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 189–190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recipients===
During the lifetime of [[Bahá'u'lláh]], the offerings were made directly to him, and following his death, to [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]]. In his [[Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bahá|Will and Testament]], `Abdu'l-Bahá provided that Huqúqu'lláh be offered after him "through the Guardian of the Cause of God".&lt;ref name="smith covenant"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= Covenant |year= 2000 |publisher= Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 114–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the election of the [[Universal House of Justice]], it is to this institution that payments are made.&lt;ref name="Cambridge"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harper"&gt;{{cite book |last = Hatcher | first= W.S. |last2= Martin | first2= J.D. |year = 1998 |title = The Bahá'í Faith: The Emerging Global Religion |publisher = Harper &amp; Row |location = San Francisco |isbn = 0-87743-264-3 | pages = 198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trustees===
* Hájí Sháh-Muhammad Manshádi, Amínu’l-Bayán (’trustee of the Bayán’; d. 1881)
* [[Hájí Amín]] (Abdu’l-Hasan Ardikání), Amín-i-Iláhi (‘trustee of God’; 1881-1928)
* Hájí Ghulám-Ridá, Amín-i-Amín (‘trustee of the trustee’; 1928–38)
* [[Valíyu'lláh Varqá]] (1938–55)
* [[`Alí-Muhammad Varqá]] (1955-2007)&lt;ref name="smith" /&gt;

==Timeline of the institution of Huqúqu'lláh==
The following is a basic timeline of the institution of '''Huqúqu'lláh'''.
* [[Kitáb-i-Aqdas|Revelation of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas]] (1873)
* Amínu’l-Bayán (1878-1881)
* [[Hájí Amín]], Amín-i-Iláhi (1881-1928)
* Hájí Ghulám-Ridá; Amín-i-Amín (1928-1938)
* [[Valíyu'lláh Varqá]] (1938-1955)
* [['Alí-Muhammad Varqá]] (1955-2007)
* Compilation Huqúqu'lláh (1985)
* Central office of Huqúqu'lláh (1991)
* Kitáb-i-Aqdas in English, Law of Huqúqu'lláh universally applicable (1992–present)

==Purpose==
The Huquq'ullah is not meant to be a donation, but is rather meant to be a claim by God for support of the interests of all people. It is partly used to equalize wealth across different parts of the world.&lt;ref name="Harper"/&gt; The payment of the Huquq'ullah is also meant to increase the spiritual link between the religion's central institutions and the individual.&lt;ref name="Harper" /&gt;  This offering is to be considered separate from giving to the various Bahá’í funds and takes precedence over them.&lt;ref name="smith" /&gt; Furthermore, the Huquq'ullah should not be solicited by anyone, and no payments of it can be accepted unless the individual was doing so "with the utmost joy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taherzadeh|first=Adib|title=The revelation of Baha'u'llah. Vol 4 : Mazra'ih &amp; Bahji 1877-92|year=1988|publisher=George Ronald|location=UK|isbn=9780853981442|page=253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calculation==
The payment of Huqúqu'lláh is based on the calculation of the value of the individual’s possessions, which includes one’s merchandise, property and income, after all necessary expenses have been paid. If a person has possessions or wealth in excess of what is necessary equal in value to at least nineteen [[mithqal|mithqál]]s of gold&lt;ref name="Cambridge"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Daan and Other Giving Traditions in India: The Forgotten Pot of Gold | first = Sanjay | last = Agarwal | publisher = AccountAid India | year = 2010 | isbn = 8191085402 | pages = 103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AC"&gt;{{cite book | title = The Baha’i Faith: A Guide For The Perplexed | first = Robert H. | last = Stockman | publisher = A &amp; C Black | year = 2012 | pages = 186–189}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2.2246 [[Troy ounce|ounces]] or 69 [[gram]]s&lt;ref name="AC" /&gt;) it is a spiritual obligation to pay nineteen percent of the total amount,&lt;ref name="Cambridge"/&gt; once only, as Huqúqu'lláh. Thereafter, whenever an individual acquires more possessions or wealth from income by the amount of at least nineteen mithqáls of gold, one is to pay nineteen percent of this increase, and so on for each further increase.&lt;ref name="smith" /&gt;

Certain categories of possessions are exempt from the payment of the Huqúqu'lláh, such as one’s residence, necessary household furnishings, business or professional equipment and furnishings, and others.&lt;ref name="Cambridge"/&gt;&lt;ref name="smith" /&gt; [[Bahá'u'lláh]] has left it to the individual to decide which items are considered necessary and which are not. Specific provisions are outlined to cover cases of financial loss, the failure of investments to yield a profit and for the payment of the Huqúqu'lláh in the event of the person’s death.

"'''Irish Son'''" is a [[pop music|pop]] song written by [[Guy Chambers]] and [[Brian McFadden]], and produced by Chambers and [[Paul Stacey]], for McFadden's first solo album, ''[[Irish Son]]''. It was released as the album's second single in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] on November 22, 2004.

The song was released following a large media build-up due to the success of his first single. However, the launch of the song was marred by controversy, when many radio stations and music channels banned the song and its accompanying music video due to the song's lyrical content, and the bad reflection focused on CBS schools in [[Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/school-outraged-mcfadden-song-linked-it-to-corporal-punishment-1.1167582|title=School 'outraged' McFadden song linked it to corporal punishment|date=23 November 2014|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elton John slammed the song's lyrical content when he reviewed the track in ''Time Out'', claiming the song was "just horrible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/showbiz/news/a20713/elton-john-apologises-to-brian-mcfadden/|title=Elton John apologises to Brian McFadden|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=17 April 2005|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the bad press surrounding the song, it failed to become his second number-one in the UK, peaking at number six.

'''Luis Hernando de Larramendi Ruiz''' (1882-1957) was a Spanish [[Carlist]] politician and theorist. Though his term as a party ''jefe'' was rather short (1919-1921), he stands out as monumental figure in history of the 20th-century Carlism, remaining among its leaders for some 40 years and taking part in decision-making process from the mid-1910s until the mid-1950s. As author he is recognized for his 1937 work, ''El sistema tradicional'', an orthodox lecture of [[Traditionalism (Spain)|Traditionalism]].

Upon her premature death he remarried with Luisa Larramendi Serrano, also a madrileña though of [[Álava|Alavese]] origins.&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had 6 children, Luis born as the oldest of the siblings and the only son.&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

The young Luis was first educated at the Madrid [[Instituto San Isidro|Instituto de San Isídro]], a prestigious [[Jesuit]] establishment with long distinguished record; it is there where he got his [[Baccalaureate (Spain)|baccalaureate]] and where he made acquaintances, some of them later public figures like Luis Urquijo, marqués de Amurrio.&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is also at the college where despite his penchant for letters he ran into problems with the teacher of Retórica y Poética, resulting in Luis’ later lukewarm attitude towards the Jesuits and formal education.&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, pp. 28-29&lt;/ref&gt; At unspecified date he entered Facultad de Derecho at [[Complutense University of Madrid|Universidad de Madrid]];&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; not averse towards bohemian lifestyle, he befriended the likes of [[Alejandro Sawa]] and [[Ramón Valle-Inclán|Ramón Valle Inclán]].&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, p. 27-28&lt;/ref&gt; Date of graduation is not known, apart that it was prior to 1905; at that time he was already practicing law as an intern,&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; to open his own law office later on. In honor of his maternal family Luis got his name changed from Hernando y Larramendi to Hernando de Larramendi y Ruiz.&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Calle de Velázquez (Madrid) 01.jpg|thumb|Calle Velázquez, Madrid]]
During his academic years Larramendi met a sister of his university colleague Mariano de Montiano,&lt;ref&gt;Mariano has later set up a bookstore in Bilbao, named Libreria Montiano, Larramendi 2000, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; María de Montiano y Uriarte (1886-1976),&lt;ref&gt;see ''Montiano'' entry, [in:] ''Euskalnet'' service, available [http://www.euskalnet.net/laviana/gen_bascas/montianocompleto.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; originating from [[Bilbao]].&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Daughter of a physician,&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; descendant to a noble prestigious family&lt;ref&gt;the Montiano family originated from Villasana del Mena and was noted in history of Bilbao already in the 16th century; its representatives held most prestigious positions in the 18th century, the best known of them general and governor of Florida, Manuel de Montiano y Sopelana&lt;/ref&gt; and considered the most handsome girl in the city,&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; she was also fanatically [[Basque people|Basque]].&lt;ref&gt;in pre-Nationalist Sabiñan terms, in her case also strongly flavored with racism; she could list 240 names of her Basque ancestors, Larramendi 2000, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; They married at unspecified time, though prior to 1904;&lt;ref&gt;their first child was born 1904, ''ABC'' 27.05.07, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/2007/05/27/078.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; he tended to be quiet and unassuming, she was also introvert, but of a decisive and bold character.&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; The couple settled at Calle Valázquez;&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; they had 9 children, 6 boys and 3 girls.&lt;ref&gt;see ''Montiano'' entry, [in:] ''Euskalnet'' service, available [http://www.euskalnet.net/laviana/gen_bascas/montianocompleto.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest son, [[Ignacio Hernando de Larramendi y Montiano|Ignacio Hernando de Larramendi]], became known nationwide as longtime manager and the moving spirit behind [[MAPFRE]], a corporate insurance giant; other children did not grow to prominence nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;one son became a Ministry of Justice official, another settled as a physician in Chicago and another was a publisher, Larramendi 2000, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Luis' grandson, Luis Hernando de Larramendi y Martínez, is one of the current Carlist leaders.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Juan Beltrán, ''Larramendi carlista de raza'', [in:] ''La Razón'' 20.11.11, available [http://www.larazon.es/historico/4894-larramendi-carlista-de-raza-HLLA_RAZON_412864#.Ttt1AKnHmLUd6bQ here]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early public career (prior to 1912)==
[[File:Don carlos de borbón nypl.jpg|left|thumb|160px|Don Carlos, Carlist king 1868-1909]]
Mariano Hernando was not a Carlist;&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; it was thanks to the influence of his paternal grandfather that during his childhood and youth Luis embraced Carlism.&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; When at the University he befriended a number of Traditionalist-minded students like [[Tomás Domínguez Arévalo|conde Rodezno]], [[José Pascual de Liñán y Eguizábal|conde de Doña Marina]]&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; and [[:es:Rafael Díaz Aguado y Salaberry|Rafael Díaz Aguado Salaberry]];&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; together with them in the first decade of the 20th century he was active in Juventud Carlista and Congregación de los Luises, a Jesuit youth organization.&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904 he was briefly editor-in-chief of an ephemeral Carlist daily ''El Correo de Guipúzcoa'', though it is not clear whether he lived in [[San Sebastián]] at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, pp. 31, 46&lt;/ref&gt; In Madrid he gained recognition in 1905 becoming secretary of Sección de Ciencias Historicas of [[Ateneo de Madrid]],&lt;ref&gt;''Diario Oficial'' 06.06.05, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000705124&amp;page=3 here]&lt;/ref&gt; though principally as a young and successful lawyer, involved in cases gaining wider publicity.&lt;ref&gt;when working as an intern in the office of prestigious Republican lawyer Toledano, Larramendi defended Aquilino Martínez Herrero, involved in Mateo Morral’s bombing attempt during the wedding of Alfonso XIII. He went to great lengths and possibly even not quite according to the rules, as was reprimended by the Tribunal, but managed to get his client acquitted. The case earned him prestige and respect among the Anarchists, Larramendi 2000, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

When in Ateneo Larramendi embarked on Catholic propaganda, trying to confront the growing secularization tide. In 1906 he addressed [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] with legal note, aimed against the plan to introduce civil marriages;&lt;ref&gt;the brochure was personally aimed against the then minister of justice, conde de Romanones, and was titled ''Romanones a la barra!''; the campaign was co-ordinated with the bishops, Larramendi 2000, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; in 1910 he published ''Cómo defendernos de las escuelas laicas'', a booklet aimed against the concept of public, secular, free and obligatory school, launched by the republican groupings; Larramendi claimed that fathers had the right to bring up their children the way they wanted.&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; Campaigning against secular education carried him as far as to [[Andalusia]],&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 09.06.10, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000289855&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; though his principal battleground were various public fora of the capital; apart from the Ateneo&lt;ref&gt;''La Epoca'' 08.12.11, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000813758&amp;page=4 here]&lt;/ref&gt; he spoke also in theatres&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 27.04.12, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000304612&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; and apart from education discussed also Catholic syndicalism&lt;ref&gt;''El Imparcial'' 09.12.11, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000287470&amp;page=3 here]&lt;/ref&gt; and episodes of public blasphemy,&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 27.04.12, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000304612&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; soon growing to president of the Madrid branch of Juventud Jaimista.&lt;ref&gt;''La Correspondencia de España'' 26.05.12, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000648830&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Jaimist meeting Vitoria 1911.JPG|thumb|Carlist meeting, 1911]]
[[Spanish general election, 1910|In 1910]] Larramendi decided to run on Traditionalist ticket for the Cortes; as he was unrelated to [[Asturias]], it is not clear why he chose the district of [[Oviedo (province)|Oviedo]]. Competing against local heavyweights like [[Melquíades Álvarez (politician)|Melquíades Álvarez]] and [[:es:José Manuel Pedregal|José Manuel Pedregal]] he stood little chance and lost,&lt;ref&gt;''La Correspondencia de España'' 10.05.10, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000615707&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; afterwards appealing corruption and unfair deployment of [[Guardia Civil]].&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; The following year he tried his chances in local elections in [[Valencia]]; this time banking on support of local Carlists like [[:es:Manuel Simó Marín|Manuel Simó]] and [[:es:Luis Lucia Lucia|Luis Lucia]], the latter running a daily ''Diario de Valencia''; the bid proved unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, pp. 47-48&lt;/ref&gt; In Madrid he engaged in launching a periodical of Traditionalist youth, which eventually materialized as ''Juventud – Organo de las Juventudes Tradicionalistas''. Given lack of broader Carlist base in Madrid the initiative proved to be short-lived, and the weekly was issued in 1912-1913 only. Nevertheless, Larramendi was already well known among conservative youth of the capital: "quién no conoce al simpático y cultisimo Larramendi?" – asked one of the periodicals.&lt;ref&gt;"Quién no ha leído sus originalísimos artículos, y saboreado sus libros singulares, y aplaudido entusiasmado su mágica palabra? Joven de preclaro entendimento, agudísimo ingenio, imaginación despierta y erudición vastisima", quoted after Larramendi 2000, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; With ease of writing, by the mid-1910s he supplied Carlist periodicals as far as [[Tortosa]],&lt;ref&gt;''La Tradicion'', José Navarro Cabanes, Apuntes bibliográficos de la prensa carlista, Valencia 1917, p. 259&lt;/ref&gt; [[Castellón de la Plana|Castellón]],&lt;ref&gt;''El Maestrazgo'', Navarro Cabanes 1917, p. 269&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alicante]]&lt;ref&gt;''El Cañon'', Navarro Cabanes 1917, p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Badajoz]],&lt;ref&gt;''Pueblo Extremeño'', Navarro Cabanes 1917, p. 304&lt;/ref&gt; let alone other titles in Madrid.&lt;ref&gt;''El Combate'', Navarro Cabanes 1917, p. 276&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rising star (1912-1919)==
[[File:ULL.48.75.1.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Larramendi speaking, 1912]]
In the 1910s Larramendi neared the socially-minded Carlists known as the "Zaragoza group" and composed of [[Pascual Comín]], [[Salvador Minguijón Adrián|Salvador Minguijón]], [[:es:Severino Azna|Severino Azna]]r and [[Inocencio Jiménez]]; they animated ''La Paz Social'' periodical and the likewise named booklet series that the first Larramendi’s work formed part of.&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; He co-operated with their Centro de Publicaciones Católicas, fascinated by French Catholic scholars grouped around [[Leon Garriguet]]. Though he eventually failed to translate [[Antonin Sertillanges]],&lt;ref&gt;to be titled ''Feminismo y Cristianismo'', Larramendi 2000, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; thanks to his work the Centro released the Spanish version of [[Albert Rougenant|Albert Rougenant’s]] ''A propos de la crise de l'Apprentissage'' (1911).&lt;ref&gt;in the Spanish version titled ''Patrones y obreros'', Nuestro Tiempo 1911, p. 142, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0002544735&amp;page=142 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in liaison with the [[Zaragoza]] group Larramendi published a series of booklets under the common title ''En la Avanzada''.&lt;ref&gt;see ''Sancho el Sabio'' catalogue, available [http://catalogo.fsancho-sabio.es/Record/3894/TOC here]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Crítica política. Cuestiones vascas. Cinematógrafo'' (1911) exploited the revolution v. counterrevolution antinomy; touching upon the Basque subject, it defended provincial fueros but lambasted separatists. ''Catecismo á los ateos. ¿Qué son las escuelas laicas? Romanones, ¡á la barra!'' (1913) re-prnted earlier pamphlets and went on with new onslaught on secular education, based on outdated illusions of [[Rousseau]]. Finally, ''¡Viva el Rey! Psicología social y literaria'' (1914) tackled major issues like monarchy, strikes, self-government and labor organization, though it also discussed literature.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. he presented Valle-Inclan, Marquina or Gabriel y Galán as proto-Traditionalists, Larramendi 2000, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from publications he did not neglect attending public meetings, delivering addresses across Spain at gatherings flavored with Carlism or social-Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in Ciudad Real - José Luis Orella Martínez, ''El origen del primer católicismo social español'' [PhD thesis UNED], Madrid 2012, pp. 78, 95, La Coruña - Orella Martínez 2012, pp. 95, 105, Valladolid - Orella Martínez 2012, p. 157, Zamora - Orella Martínez 2012, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1910s Carlism was increasingly paralyzed by internal crisis related to conflict between the claimant [[Jaime, Duke of Madrid|Don Jaime]] and the key party theorist, [[Juan Vázquez de Mella]]; both factions competed to control the Madrid-based semi-official Carlist daily, ''[[:es:El Correo Español|El Correo Español]]''.&lt;ref&gt;for details, see Agustín Fernández Escudero, ''El marqués de Cerralbo (1845-1922): biografía politica'' [PhD thesis], Madrid 2012, pp. 465-472&lt;/ref&gt; Larramendi remained fully loyal to his king; moreover, as a lawyer he helped to transfer the newspaper ownership to marqués de Valldespina and to purge the editorial board from dissenters like [[:es:Miguel Fernández Peñaflor|Peñaflor]].&lt;ref&gt;Juan Ramón de Andrés Martín, ''El cisma mellista. Historia de una ambición política'', Madrid 2000, {{ISBN|9788487863820}}, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; He confirmed his image of a loyal subject also during the [[Spanish general election, 1914|1914 elections]]. With propaganda campaign already in full swing, the party candidate in [[Vitoria-Gasteiz|Vitoria]], [[Esteban de Bilbao Eguía|Esteban Bilbao]], balked at the official plan and fielded his candidature in [[Durango, Biscay|Durango]]; as emergency measure Larramendi was asked to replace him. It turned out he had little chance standing against the Conservative leader, [[Eduardo Dato]], though following defeat he did not hesitate to appeal administrative pressure.&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, p. 50-51&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Flag of Cross of Burgundy.svg|thumbnail|Carlist standard]]
In the late 1910s Larramendi was already recognized as an important figure in the party,&lt;ref&gt;"una figura muy destacada dentro del Partido", Larramendi 2000, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; though he did not rise to executive structures either nationwide or on the regional Castilian basis&lt;ref&gt;the regional jefe for Castilla La Nueva was Celestino de Alcocer, Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 443&lt;/ref&gt; and was rather considered a young man for the future.&lt;ref&gt;[[Melchor Ferrer Dalmau|Melchor Ferrer]], ''Historia del tradicionalismo español'', vol. XXIX, Sevilla 1960, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; The setting changed dramatically when following the end of [[World War One]] the claimant was released from his confinement in [[Austria]] and early 1919 arrived in [[Paris]] to reclaim party leadership from the [[Mellismo|Mellistas]]. The conflict exploded in expulsion of de Mella and massive defections of his supporters, many of them occupying key positions in Carlist structures; command chain of the party was decimated. Political delegate of the king in Spain, [[Enrique de Aguilera y Gamboa|marqués de Cerralbo]], resigned; he was only provisionally replaced by Pascual Comín, who upon appointment declared he was not prepared to stay at the helm longer than provisionally.&lt;ref&gt;Ferrer 1960, pp. 119-120&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leader (1919-1921)==
[[File:ULL.19.18.18.jpg|thumb|left|Larramendi and [[Jaime, Duke of Madrid|Don Jaime]], 1919]]
Comín appreciated Larramendi following works of the Zaragoza group; he suggested that the Madrid lawyer becomes his replacement.&lt;ref&gt;Ferrer 1960, pp 119-121&lt;/ref&gt; Don Jaime acknowledged Larramendi’s loyalty during the strife for control of ''El Correo''. Moreover, as a young militant deprived of own political basis&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi had no intimate political friends and tended to be a lone player, Ferrer 1960, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; he seemed to have posed no threat to royal leadership; his location in Madrid and profession of a lawyer offered additional advantages. Lack of experience was a disadvantage; [[Francisco Martín Melgar y Rodríguez|Melgar]] dissuaded the choice also due to pro-German Larramendi’s leaning during the war.&lt;ref&gt;Andrés Martín 2000, p. 146, Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 515; Larremendi remained a German sympathiser also later on, José Javier López Antón, ''Trayectoria ideológica del carlismo bajo don Jaime III, 1909-1931'', [in:] ''Aportes'' 15 (1990), p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Don Jaime’s special envoy&lt;ref&gt;named Miguel de Torres&lt;/ref&gt; to Madrid returned with good news and in August 1919 the claimant appointed Larramendi his key representative in Spain and effectively the party leader, though not with the title of Jefe Delegado, but as a Secretario General.&lt;ref&gt;Ferrer 1960, pp. 119-120, Larramendi 2000, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

Larramendi faced an extremely difficult task of re-building command structures.&lt;ref&gt;perhaps Larramendi’s best known personal decision is appointing Juan Perez de Najera as replacement of Joaquín Llorens at the helm of Carlist requeté militia, Jordi Canal, ''El carlismo. Dos siglos de contrarrevolución en España'', Madrid 2000, {{ISBN|9788420639475}}, p. 277. The decision was rather an unfortunate one, as the 75-year-old did little to reinvigorate the ailing organisation&lt;/ref&gt; He threw himself into a series of hectic meetings with provincial and regional leaders, incessantly touring the country;&lt;ref&gt;Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 515, Canal 2000, p. 277&lt;/ref&gt; in some cases, like [[Catalonia]] or [[Valencia Region|Valencia]], he faced also bitter personal conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;Ferrer 1960, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from that, as a lawyer he successfully kept fighting off the Mellistas when struggling for ''El Correo''.&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, p. 51. He released also an anti-Mellist booklet, ''Omisiones y Desvaríos de Mella'', published in 1919, Larramendi 2000, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; His first major initiative was launching the project of a grand Carlist assembly; it materialized in November 1919 as Magna Junta de [[Biarritz]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrés Martín 2000, p. 184, Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 516, Ferrer 1960, p. 124, Canal 2000, p. 277&lt;/ref&gt; The event was a success as it consolidated the party and helped it to re-gain momentum, even though in none of 3 major issued debated - re-organization, financial problems and marriage of Don Jaime - any key decision was adopted.&lt;ref&gt;Canal 2000, p. 277&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920 Larramendi focused mostly on engineering the Carlist electoral campaign; none of the scholarly sources consulted provides information on what strategy he adopted, though he is known to have angrily rejected veiled calls for a low-denomination Catholic right-wing alliance, advocated by emergent accidentalist [[Christian democracy|Christian-Democratic]] groupings and their mouthpiece, ''[[El Debate]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"a no ser que sea tradicionalista el derecho que no es católico ni protestante; y que ‘futuras Constituciones’ vistas a través de la rusa bolchevique y de la alemana socialista, sean tradicionalistas también; y que la ‘dictadura’, sea tradicionalismo; y que lo sea la ‘representación proporcional’; y la ‘expropiación de la tierra; y hasta Galdós..", quoted after Andrés Martín 2000, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign was an utter failure; 3 mandates secured&lt;ref&gt;Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 520; the Carlists gained also 2 seats in the senate, Melchor Ferrer, ''Breve historia del legitimismo español'', Madrid 1958, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; was the worst result since the [[Electoral Carlism (Restoration)|Carlists joined electoral competition]] in the early 1890s. Also personally Larramendi had to acknowledge defeat: running in the [[Navarre]]se district of [[Aoiz]], for some 20 years almost an exclusive Carlist electoral fiefdom, he lost to a [[Conservative Party (Spain)|Conservative]] counter-candidate.&lt;ref&gt;''Heraldo de Madrid'' 13.12.20, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000770100&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Junta de Biarritz.jpg|thumb|Junta de Biarritz]]
In 1921 Larramendi seemed already overwhelmed by mounting problems;&lt;ref&gt;he found time to cultivate his penchant for letters and issued to satirical publications, a short drama ''Papá Ministro'' and ''Guía Sociológica de Aspirantes al Matrimonió'', Larramendi 2000, p. 52, Ferrer 1960, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; another one were rumors about negotiations related to some sort of dynastic accord, allegedly conducted by Don Jaime with the [[Alfonsism|Alfonsist branch]]; Larramendi has always been fiercely hostile to any compromise with the despised Liberal dynasty. He arranged for another grand meeting; it took place in [[Lourdes]], though due to lower attendance and minor scale of discussions taking place it was rather an operational session than a milestone comparable to the Biarritz amassment;&lt;ref&gt;Ferrer 1960, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; it provided Larramendi with little assistance. Soon afterwards the claimant left for [[Colombia]] with hardly any guidance or information passed to his delegate in Spain; upon his return, in the summer of 1921, Larramendi handed his resignation.&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, p. 52, Ferrer 1960, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; When discussing its background, some scholars claim he was tired of uphill struggle;&lt;ref&gt;Ferrer 1960, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; others point to talks with the Alfonsists and general Don Jaime’s detachment&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, p. 52, Ferrer 1960, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; or Larramendi’s remorse about the 1920 electoral disaster.&lt;ref&gt;Canal 2000, p. 278&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the back seat (1921-1930)==
[[File:Marqués de Villores 2.png|thumb|160px|left|Marqués de Villores]]
Replaced as Carlist political leader by [[José Selva Mergelina|marqués de Villores]], Larramendi remained engaged in the party executive; his activity was related to dynastical issues rather than to daily business. In 1922 he represented Don Jaime’s sister, [[Infanta Blanca of Spain|Doña Blanca]], in court; wife to a member of the imperial [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg house]] she refused to recognize the [[First Austrian Republic|Austrian republic]] and sought shelter in Spain. Larramendi presented her case when claiming the Spanish citizenship, resulting in a booklet titled ''Dictamen referente a la nacionalidad de S.A.R. Doña Blanca de Borbón y Borbón''.&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, p. 53, the booklet is available at Fundación de Larramendi site, see [http://www.larramendi.es/i18n/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;presentacion=pagina&amp;path=1001247 here]&lt;/ref&gt; His efforts were crowned with success and Doña Blanca with her family settled in [[Barcelona]]. In the future the episode would prove of great value for the [[Carloctavismo|Carloctavista]] dynastic claim,&lt;ref&gt;for detailed discussion, see José Maria de Montells y Galán, ''La Otra Dinastia, 1833-1975'', Madrid 1995, {{ISBN|8492001658}}, Francisco de las Heras y Borrero, ''Un pretendiente desconocido. Carlos de Habsburgo. El otro candidato de Franco'', Madrid 2004, {{ISBN|8497725565}}, César Alcalá, ''Cruzadistas y carloctavistas: historia de una conspiración'', Barcelona 2012, {{ISBN|9788493884253}}&lt;/ref&gt; but no source clarifies whether in the early 1920s Larramendi considered her sons would-be claimants to the Spanish throne. It is confirmed, however, that he was acutely aware of the looming dynastical crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; As Don Jaime, at that time in his early 50s, had no offspring, the Carlist branch was endangered with extinction. Larramendi kept advocating last-minute rescue mission by Don Jaime’s marriage with his niece;&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, p. 53, Ferrer 1960, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; the scheme crashed when in 1922 Fabiola Massimo married an Italian aristocrat.&lt;ref&gt;see ''Fabiola Massimo'' entry at ''The Peerage'' service, available [http://www.thepeerage.com/p8649.htm#i86489 here]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Jaime de Borbón, in El Mundo Grafico 7 10 1931 página 24.jpg|thumb|160px|Don Jaime, Carlist king 1909-1931]]
The 1923 advent of [[Miguel Primo de Rivera|Primo de Rivera]] dictatorship brought national political life to a standstill: all parties have been dissolved. It seems that initially Larramendi welcomed the coup as doing away with a long overdue liberal democracy and a stepping stone towards Traditionalist monarchy, position fairly popular among the Carlists; his friend, [[Víctor Pradera Larumbe|Víctor Pradera]],&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; wholeheartedly engaged in building the regime structures. In late 1924 Larramendi addressed the military directorate with a letter; it contained congratulations on "patriotic work" and offered personal services.&lt;ref&gt;''Heraldo Alaves'' 04.12.24, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=4&amp;path=1000026415&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; Another letter denied lack of understanding for "movimiento regenerador de 13 de Septiembre"; written from clearly Jaimist positions, it praised the military for cracking down on [[:es:Caciquismo (España)|caciquismo]] and bureaucracy, considered support for the government "most basic duty of a citizen" and even declared [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|Alfonso XIII]] "más fecunda encarnación de España".&lt;ref&gt;''Diario de Valencia'' 12.12.24, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;path=1000192713&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt;

It seems that in the mid-1920s Larramendi’s lukewarm approval turned into disappointment, still in line with official line adopted by Don Jaime. He could not understand how Rodezno, his juvenile acquaintance of love-and-hate relationship, could have accepted the [[Villafranca]] mayorship "given the circumstances";&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; by his son he was recollected as opposed to Primo and refusing to join either [[Patriotic Union (Spain)|Unión Patriótica]] or any other primoderiverista structure.&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, pp. 31, 53-4&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, in the late 1920s he was recorded mostly as active in the Catholic realm, giving lectures&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 21.03.28, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000440340&amp;page=3 here], also ''El Siglo Futuro'' 04.02.31, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000481873&amp;page=6 here]&lt;/ref&gt; and once assigned a somewhat ambiguous praise of "[[Ángel Ganivet|Ganivet]] Católico".&lt;ref&gt;''Oro de Ley'' 15.01.26, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0004509711&amp;page=18 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Though in 1930 he took part in Catholic political initiatives of strongly [[:es:Accidentalismo|accidentalist]] leaning, like the [[Salamanca]] gathering with [[Gil-Robles]] and [[Ángel Herrera Oria|Herrera Oria]],&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; he stood firmly by monarchist views, also during confusion of the last months of the monarchy, at times attracting fire from the young Jaimist hot-heads.&lt;ref&gt;''El Cruzado Español'' 09.05.30, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0029005384&amp;page=5 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

==On the rise again (1931-1934)==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-11543, Madrid, Ausrufung der Zweiten Spanischen Republik.jpg|thumb|left|[[Second Spanish Republic|Republic]] declared, 1931]]
From his Calle de Velázquez apartment Larramendi watched revolutionary masses ruling the streets of Madrid during declaration of the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republic]] in April 1931 and soon afterwards the smoke of burning churches during [[Burning of convents in Spain (1931)|Quema de Conventos]] in May.&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst bewilderment of the Right he decided to defend the monarchist cause standing in the [[Spanish general election, 1931|forthcoming Cortes elections]] as a Jaimist candidate in Madrid. His campaign confronted the anti-clerical and anti-religious tide head on: Larramendi referred to the Church as to a truly popular structure, with priests and friars "la sangre del pueblo más humilde de España".&lt;ref&gt;''La Nación'' 25.06.31, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0026293505&amp;page=4 here]&lt;/ref&gt; With his propaganda machine reduced to some 30 members of the Madrid Círculo Jaimista &lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, pp. 32, 54&lt;/ref&gt; he gathered some 7,500 votes,&lt;ref&gt;''El Cruzado Español'' 25.11.32, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0029022011&amp;page=4 here]&lt;/ref&gt; compared to 134,000 votes for the leading candidate and 36,000 for the last candidate elected.

During the summer Larramendi launched a new periodical, ''Criterio. Revista Semanal de Orientación Política y Literaria''. Some authors claim he was one of key people behind it,&lt;ref&gt;with his Manuel Palacios Olmedo, Larramendi 2000, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; others name him manager of the weekly, which represented "most combative Carlism".&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Manuel Moral Roncal, ''1868 en la memoria carlista de 1931: dos revoluciones anticlericales y un paralelo'', [in:] ''Hispania Sacra'', 59/119 (2007), p. 346&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1931 and early 1932 ''Criterio'' was enthusiastically supporting unification of three Traditionalist branches in [[:es:Comunión Tradicionalista|Comunión Tradicionalista]], though it remained a private enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;Moral Roncal 2007, p. 346&lt;/ref&gt; It attracted a few known names like Pradera, [[:es:José María Pemán|Pemán]] and [[:es:José María Albiñana|Albiñana]],&lt;ref&gt;and Fabio, a columnist of ''El Siglo Futuro'', Larramendi 2000, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; but in August closed due to financial problems.&lt;ref&gt;having published 45 issues, Larramendi 2000, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Larramendi engaged also in Traditionalist propaganda meetings, at times featured among the party pundits.&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1932 and across 1933 his activity became intense and there was hardly a month without a press note on his public harangues;&lt;ref&gt;compare ''El Siglo Futuro'' 03.01.33, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000505950&amp;page=1 here], ''El Siglo Futuro'' 09.01.33, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000506182&amp;page=1 here], ''El Siglo Futuro'' 06.03.33, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000508318&amp;page=1 here], ''El Siglo Futuro'' 26.03.33, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000509170&amp;page=2 here], ''El Siglo Futuro'' 08.04.33, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000509515&amp;page=2 here], ''El Siglo Futuro'' 03.05.33, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000510451&amp;page=1 here], ''El Siglo Futuro'' 24.05.33, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000511229&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; in June 1933 he defended in court generals accused of taking part in [[Sanjurjada]].&lt;ref&gt;''La Libertad'' 20.06.33, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0003066311&amp;page=5 here]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Don Alfonso Carlos y el marqués de Villores.png|thumb|160px|Alfonso Carlos (middle)]]
Though recognized in the movement as one its former leader and one of most experienced militants, during the early 1930s he did not count among top Carlist executive.&lt;ref&gt;in early 1932, shortly following re-unification of Carlism, he was not listed among leaders of national, regional or provincial ruling bodies, see Antonio Manuel Moral Roncal, ''La cuestión religiosa en la Segunda República española. Iglesia y carlismo'', Madrid, 2009, {{ISBN|9788497429054}}, pp. 78-79&lt;/ref&gt; His relations with the new party leader Rodezno have always been ambiguous; in the 1930s they were aggravated by differences on policy versus the Alfonsists; unlike Rodezno, Larramendi was as usual vehemently opposed to compromising intransigent Carlist stand&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; and averse to entering [[:es:Renovación Española|Bloque Nacional]].&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that an alliance would turn 100 years of Carlist history, including 80,000 men who [[Carlist Wars|gave lives for their king]], into a comedy;&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; moreover, such an ambiguous coalition would merely weaken the only force capable of confronting the revolution, namely Traditionalism.&lt;ref&gt;"la política de derechas no es más que un equivoco, con el cual, acqui en España, se rompe la unión tradicional de los católicos y se da una puñalada trapera al único frente opuesto a la Revolución, que es el Tradicionalismo", quoted after Larramendi 2000, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

During gear-up to the [[Spanish general election, 1933|1933 electoral campaig]]n he was overruled by Rodezno, who pushed for a joint far-Right alliance. Larramendi decided to comply and [[Electoral Carlism (Second Republic)|agreed to stand]] as a sole Traditionalist candidate on a joint "Coalición antimarxista" list in Madrid.&lt;ref&gt;''La Epoca'' 27.10.33, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0001122688&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign in general was a triumph of the Right, but in the urban Madrid constituency [[PSOE]] retained its dominant position and Larramendi, though attracted 130,000 votes,&lt;ref&gt;''La Nación'' 05.12.33, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0026323187&amp;page=3 here]&lt;/ref&gt; failed again. Despite the defeat suffered, he continued with intense propaganda activity, which in the mid-1930 became nothing less than hectic. There were periods when hardly a week passed by without his public appearance noted in the press,&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 29.04.35, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000540562&amp;page=11 here], ''El Siglo Futuro'' 04.05.35, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000541106&amp;page=26 here], ''La Epoca'' 09.05.35, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0001158136&amp;page=4 here], ''El Siglo Futuro'' 13.05.35, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000542068&amp;page=10 here], ''El Siglo Futuro'' 24.05.35, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000543459&amp;page=19 here]&lt;/ref&gt; the Traditionalist one hailing him as "elocuente orador".&lt;ref&gt;his son recalls Larramendi as great speaker, both during public meetings and in court, Larramendi 2000, p.  27, though he is characterised as appealing to logic rather than to emotions, Ferrer 1960, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

==Back in the executive (1934-1937)==
[[File:ULL.98.42.5.11.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Larramendi, mid-1930s]]
In 1934 Rodezno was replaced as the Carlist leader by [[Manuel Fal Conde]]; the new setting suited Larramendi more, and he soon started to assume high positions within the party structures. In 1934 he was appointed to Consejo de Cultura,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Vallverdú i Martí, ''El Carlisme Català Durant La Segona República Espanyola 1931-1936'', Barcelona 2008, {{ISBN|9788478260805}}, p. 163, Ferrer 1960, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; a decorative body entrusted with disseminating Traditionalist thought. More important was his 1935 nomination to Consejo de Comunión Tradicionalista, set up as a collective executive supposed to assist Fal.&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, p. 57, Vallverdú i Martí 2008, p. 263, Ferrer 1958, p. 119, Ferrer 1960, p. 66, Canal 2000, p. 317&lt;/ref&gt; Fully aligned with the leader, Larramendi went on lambasting any conservative compromise and kept voicing against new far-Right coalitions.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. his rectification letters to press, ''El Siglo Futuro'' 03.02.36, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000574876&amp;page=7 here], also Vallverdú i Martí 2008, p. 185, Canal 2000, p. 317&lt;/ref&gt;

A penchant for accord with the Alfonsinos, demonstrated by some Carlists, stemmed from a looming dynastical crisis; the claimant [[Infante Alfonso Carlos, Duke of San Jaime|Don Alfonso Carlos]] was an octogenarian and there was no clear successor in sight. Larramendi was leaning towards the deposed Portuguese [[House of Braganza|Braganza]] family, pointing to [[Duarte Nuno, Duke of Braganza|Duarte Nuño]] as to a potential Carlist successor.&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, p. 56, Ferrer 1958, p. 113, Canal 2000, p. 306&lt;/ref&gt; However, later he got converted to a regentialist solution. In early 1936 it was Larramendi, considered totally loyal and an excellent lawyer, who edited the royal decree of Alfonso Carlos; it nominated [[Prince Xavier of Bourbon-Parma|Don Javier]] as the future Carlist regent.&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, pp. 27, 57&lt;/ref&gt; As authority he wrote prologue to ''Historia critica del tradicionalismo español'' of [[:es:Benedicto Torralba de Damas|Benedicio Torralba de Damas]].&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 21.03.36, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000579712&amp;page=9 here]&lt;/ref&gt; His vital role was reflected in the [[Spanish general election, 1936|1936 electoral campaign]], when together with Fal he negotiated a failed deal with Gil-Robles.&lt;ref&gt;Vallverdú i Martí 2008, p. 287&lt;/ref&gt; For unclear reasons he ran in [[Girona|Gerona]];&lt;ref&gt;on the Frente Catalán de Orden list&lt;/ref&gt; his name sounded strange among Catalan candidates&lt;ref&gt;Vallverdú i Martí 2008, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt; though it was [[Popular Front (Spain)|Frente Popular]] triumph which contributed to his next electoral failure.&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, p. 57, ''El Siglo Futuro'' 19.02.36, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000575016&amp;page=13 here]; he gained 39,400 votes compared to 64,000 of the last frentepopulista candidate, ''La Vanguardia'' 18.02.36, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1936/02/06/pagina-13/33130915/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; Last but not least, as an abogado he kept defending Carlists before the Republican courts.&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 18.04.36, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000582256&amp;page=18 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not clear whether Larramendi was aware of Carlist gear-up to the [[Spanish coup of July 1936|1936 coup]]. In early July with half of his children he moved to the usual family summer location in San Sebastián; his wife and remaining children joined him on July 14. When learning about the rising in [[Spanish Morocco|Morocco]] he noted „todo estaba perdido”, probably reflecting his mistrust towards the military.&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; Since in [[Gipuzkoa]] the insurgency failed, as a safety measure he moved to a nearby hotel,&lt;ref&gt;his 1905 defence of an Anarchist terrorist might have saved Larramendi’s life in 1936; one the San Sebastián Anarchist leaders was his neighbor and remained perfectly aware of his whereabouts, but failed to denounce him, Larramendi 2000, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; but on July 20 left the city and made it on foot to Navarre, already controlled by the Carlists.&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; In September, together with the victorious [[Requeté]], he returned to San Sebastián and commenced editing a new Carlist periodical, ''La Voz de España'';&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, pp. 34, 58&lt;/ref&gt; he is also noted as helping some [[Partido Nacionalista Vasco|PNV]] activists to flee.&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, p. 34, Manuel Martorell Pérez, ''La continuidad ideológica del carlismo tras la Guerra Civil'' [PhD thesis], Valencia 2009, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:El gran visir de Marruecos, Sidi Mohamed el Llemagni, en San Sebastián (3 de 4) - Fondo Car-Kutxa Fototeka.jpg|thumb|Carlists in Donostia, 1937]]
Larramendi did not enter any of the wartime Carlist ruling bodies,&lt;ref&gt;his not listed when discussing personal appointments in Junta Nacional Carlista de Guerra and its commissions, see Ricardo Ollaquindia, ''La Oficina de Prensa y Propaganda Carlista de Pamplona al comienzo de la guerra de 1936'', [in:] ''Príncipe de Viana'' 56 (1995), pp. 499-505&lt;/ref&gt; though he remained among close collaborators of Don Javier.&lt;ref&gt;among top Carlist leaders in October 1936 he travelled to Vienna to attend the funeral of Don Alfonso Carlos, Julio Aróstegui, ''Combatientes Requetés en la Guerra Civil Española (1936–1939)'', Madrid 2013, {{ISBN|9788499709758}}, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; Already in late 1936 he voiced against [[Falange Española de las JONS|Falangist]] drive for power;&lt;ref&gt;in December 1936 Larramendi wrote vaguely, though according to the present-day scholar referring to the Falangists, that "nadie tiene el derecho a descubrir ni a inventar España", Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; when unification within a state party became a burning issue in early 1937 he tended to skepticism. He was present during a meeting of Carlist executive in [[Insua]], but there is little data on his stance.&lt;ref&gt;he is not listed in most detailed study on pre-unification discussions among the Carlists, see Juan Carlos Peñas Bernaldo de Quirós, ''El Carlismo, la República y la Guerra Civil (1936-1937). De la conspiración a la unificación'', Madrid 1996, {{ISBN|9788487863523}}, pp. 241-301&lt;/ref&gt; It seems that like most Traditionalist leaders he was disoriented; the only information available is that he insisted on clear war objectives.&lt;ref&gt;Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; The Insua meeting was his last appearance amongst the party leaders before the [[:es:Decreto de Unificación|Unification Decree]] was announced.

==Reclusive and patriarch (after 1937)==
[[File:Desfile de tropas por las calles de San Sebastián (8 de 20) - Fondo Car-Kutxa Fototeka.jpg|thumb|left|Carlists on Francoist parade, 1940s]]
Larramendi refused to join [[Francoist]] structures and criticized those who did; he verbally assaulted [[Julio Muñoz Aguilar]], co-editor from ''La Voz de España'', for an article supporting [[Francisco Franco|Franco]].&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, p. 31, Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937 he closed himself for a month in a San Sebastián hotel and wrote ''El sistema tradicional''. The work was an orthodox lecture of political Traditionalism, stemming from assumption that traditionalist system does not need to be implemented: it exists as a natural phenomenon. It is not clear whether Larramendi hoped to get the work published; it was not possible before 1952, when it went to print as ''Cristiandad, Tradición y Realeza''.&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938 he agreed that two of his sons, aged 17 and 16, enlist to Requeté.&lt;ref&gt;Pablo Larraz Andía, Víctor Sierra-Sesumaga (eds.), ''Requetés. De las trincheras al olvidio'', Madrid 2011, {{ISBN|9788499700465}}, p. 323&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939 Larramendi returned to Madrid, still in touch with Don Javier. In 1940 the Alfonsist heir, [[Infante Juan, Count of Barcelona|Don Juan]], addressed the regent with a letter, seeking dynastic concord; Larramendi made sure the response was as harsh and uncompromising as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; He remained a central figure among Madrid Traditionalists&lt;ref&gt;Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; and supplied party youth bulletins, issued by semi-clandestine AET, with his articles.&lt;ref&gt;though by some young Madrid Carlists he was considered an old-time intellectual out of touch with current reality, Josep Miralles Climent, ''Estudiantes y obreros carlistas durante la dictadura franquista. La AET, el MOT y la FOS'', Madrid 2007, {{ISBN|9788495735331}}, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; Though falling short of openly anti-Francoist language, they constituted a call for loyalty to Carlism, during its history "exonerado, proscrito, confiscado en prisiones, fusilado, asesinado, perseguido, traicionado, calumniado, silenciado, y vendido durante más de un siglo, dado por muerte mil veces", but remaining "tradición inmarcesible de la España eterna".&lt;ref&gt;quoted after Larramendi 2000, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; He took part in public Carlist events, tolerated by the regime, e.g. the annual Fiesta de los Mártires de la Tradición&lt;ref&gt;''Pensamiento Alaves'' 09.03.40, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;path=1000033876&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; or funerals of Carlist leaders.&lt;ref&gt;''Pensamiento Alaves'' 29.04.42, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=5&amp;path=1000032739&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Don Javier 1960.jpg|thumb|160px|Don Javier, Carlist regent and king, 1936-1975]]
On the practical side, Larramendi resumed his career of a lawyer. The number of his customers decreased as they realized that the new political setting provided him with neither political influence&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; nor any other benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, pp. 34-35&lt;/ref&gt; He continued serving some of the older clientele, e.g. in the 1940s fighting legal battles related to heritage and last will of a Carlist aristocrat, [[barón de Sangarren]].&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1940s Larramendi, at that time almost 70, acquired the status of Carlist moral authority if not a movement's patriarch. He was aging quickly; in the 1950s he suffered heavily from [[arteriosclerosis]] and loss of sight, gradually turning almost blind.&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, pp. 34-35&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, he remained engaged in internal politics and counted among those who advocated termination of the regency, to be replaced with personal claim of Don Javier. In 1952 he presided over the Consejo Nacional de la Tradición meeting, discussing how it should be advanced; due to health reasons he did not attend the [[:es:XXXV Congreso Eucarístico Internacional|Eucharistic Congress in Barcelona]], where Don Javier was effectively introduced as a king.&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955 Larramendi met his monarch for the last time.&lt;ref&gt;in Gipúzkoan in Palacio de Murguía, Larramendi 2000, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; When in the mid-1950s the intransigent Carlist opposition to Franco came under fire as inefficient and counter-productive, Larramendi kept protesting a would-be rapprochement.&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Martorell Pérez, ''Carlos Hugo frente a Juan Carlos. La solución federal para España que Franco rechazó'', Madrid 2014, {{ISBN|9788477682653}}, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars claim that in 1956 he was nominated to a new Carlist executive, Secretariado General;&lt;ref&gt;Mercedes Vázquez de Prada, ''El nuevo rumbo político del carlismo hacia la colaboración con el régimen (1955-56)'', [in:] ''Hispania'' 69 (2009), p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; this is not impossible, as at that time Larramendi was sort of a Carlist living saint;&lt;ref&gt;in October 1957 Ramón Massó, at that time leader of AET, wrote: "Alguíen, que vio el carlismo como una gran familia, diagnosticó nuestra fuerza y nuestra debilidad. Los lazos afectivos que nos unen nos hace personalistas, a favor o en contra. Olvidamos que nuestro único personalismo posible es el del Rey. Hace mas de treinta anos D. Luis H. de Larramendi vio el problema con perfecta exactitud. Para él, el carlismo se habia contagiado de los vicios políticos del viejo liberalismo", and went on to argue that a genuine Carlist should remain steadfast in unshaken loyalty to the dynasty, quoted after Miralles Climent 2007, p. 126. Though Massó's strategy was manipulation, aiming at ensuring unchallenged lead of Don Carlos Hugo to pursue an unorthodox socialismo autogestionario path later on, the quotation demonstrates that he considered it useful to refer to Larramendi as to a supreme moral authority&lt;/ref&gt; however, others point rather to his son, Ignacio.&lt;ref&gt;Francisco Javier Caspistegui Garasurreta, ''El naufragio de las ortodoxias.

==Reception and legacy==
[[File:ULL.BLIGHTY.26.PLUS.6.IS.1.jpg|thumb|left|Fundacion Ignacio Larramendi logotype]]
It seems that despite his longtime presence among top Carlist political strata, Larramendi generated little personal antagonism; cases of open challenge are scarce and seem to be rather circumstantial,&lt;ref&gt;''El Cruzado Español'' 09.05.30, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0029005384&amp;page=5 here]&lt;/ref&gt; while there is evidence of respect even among the most die-hard Carlist enemies, the [[Anarchism in Spain|Anarchists]].&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Following death he was gradually falling into oblivion; the popular Madrid daily ''[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]]'' mentioned him for the first time in 1982, in a commemorative article by his grandson.&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 06.10.82, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1982/10/06/025.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; It was only in the late 1980s that his name started to circulate widely in public discourse, all thanks to Fundación Hernando de Larramendi, set up by his son in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;now operating as Fundación Ignacio Larramendi, see ''La Fundación'' entry, [in:] ''Fundación Ignacio Larramendi'' service, available [http://www.larramendi.es/cms/elemento.cmd?id=estaticos/paginas/fundacion.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; Its declared mission is to promote "caridad en las relaciones sociales" in line with the Catholic teaching, to act as independent think-tank, to study history of Carlism and to support non-commercial scientific research;&lt;ref&gt;see ''Objetivos'' entry, [in:] ''Fundación Ignacio Larramendi'' service, available [http://www.larramendi.es/cms/elemento.cmd?id=estaticos/paginas/objetivos_fundacionales.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; its most visible activities are those related to dissemination of Traditionalist thought and promotion of Carlist studies. The foundation honors Larramendi’s name in editorial series, titled ''Colección Luis Hernando de Larramendi'', and in awards in history of Carlism, named Premio Internacional de Historia del Carlismo Luis Hernando de Larramendi.&lt;ref&gt;for regulations, see [http://www.larramendi.es/cms/fichero.cmd?id=estaticos/ficheros/2016-prem-carlismo-eng-ampliado.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt;

Luis Hernando de Larramendi gained no dedicated scholarly work; the closest thing to a monograph are chapters dedicated to his father by Ignacio Hernando de Larramendi in his book, ''Así se hizo MAPFRE'' (2000).&lt;ref&gt;Ignacio Hernando de Larramendi, ''Mi padre'', pp. 25-35, and ''Mi padre como político carlista'', pp. 45-79, [in:] Ignacio Hernando de Larramendi, ''Así se hizo MAPFRE. Mi tiempo'', Madrid 2000, {{ISBN|9788487863875}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though highly hagiographic, they provide the most detailed information available so far. Apart from well-known facts from his political career, the chapters offer also lots of private observations and recollections; they paint a picture of a Catholic taking [[Eucharist|communion]] almost every day,&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; a profoundly idealist person,&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; extremely sensitive to any sort of injustice&lt;ref&gt;especially injustice towards the weak and the poor, Larramendi 2000, p. 26; as late as 1957 he is referred to as defending children, deemed treated unjustly on the street, Larramendi 2000, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; and unrepentant in his political creed, but incapable of violence.&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Though humble and unpretentious, he is also portrayed as intolerant versus foolishness; this trait is considered moral defect,&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; though also an obstacle in Larramendi’s professional and political career. Tending to solitude, he ran his law office on his own and was getting outpaced by modern legal companies;&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, pp. 27, 31&lt;/ref&gt; in terms of politics he built no personal following, relying entirely on his loyalty to the dynasty and trust in Traditionalist doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cristiandad, Tradición, Realeza.jpg|thumb|160px|''El sistema tradicional'', published as ''Cristiandad, Tradición, Realeza'']]
In Carlist historiography Larramendi is treated briefly, usually when discussing his 1919-1921 leadership tenure and the 1936 decree of Don Alfonso Carlos.&lt;ref&gt;Canal 2000, pp. 275, 277, 278, 306, 318, 417, 421&lt;/ref&gt; In history of political thought his written opus, ''El sistema tradicional'', went largely unnoticed and is not discussed in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Jorge Novella Suarez, ''El pensamiento reaccionario español 1812-1975'', Madrid 2007, {{ISBN|9788497425483}}, Pedro Carlos González Cuevas, ''El pensamiento político de la derecha española en el siglo XX'', Madrid 2005, {{ISBN|9788430942237}}, Pedro Carlos González Cuevas, ''Tradicionalismo'', [in:] Javier Fernández Sebastián (ed.), ''Diccionario político y social del siglo XX español'', Madrid 2008, {{ISBN|9788420687698}}, pp. 1163-1173&lt;/ref&gt; Abroad Larramendi has been acknowledged as important, though not a first-row thinker, noted rather for his legal dynastic reading.&lt;ref&gt;and trivia like his beard, see Jacek Bartyzel, ''Nic bez Boga, nic wbrew tradycji'', Radzymin 2015, {{ISBN|9788360748732}}, pp. 17, 70, 105, 116-117, 134, 247-248, 306, 309, 338, 354, 367&lt;/ref&gt; His son presented ''El sistema'' in sequence of great theoretical works, following those of [[Enrique Gil Robles|Gil Robles]], Vázquez de Mella and Pradera, and preceding those of [[Francisco Elías de Tejada y Spínola|Elías de Tejada]] and [[Rafael Gambra Ciudad|Gambra]]. He is portrayed as sworn Christian counter-revolutionary, concerned with justice in general and protection of the weak in particular. The enemy of democracy founded on [[universal suffrage]], he embraced the vision of Catholic monarchy, based on traditional social establishments and [[Corporatism|organic representation]].&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2000, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael Andrew Fox''' {{post-nominals|OC}} (born June 9, 1961), known professionally as '''Michael J. Fox''', is a Canadian-American&lt;!-- Fox holds dual Canadian-US citizenship. --&gt; actor, author, film producer, activist and comedian with a film and television career spanning from the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/michael-j-fox-q-a-1.4017957|title=Michael J. Fox on his Canadian pride and why he speaks out|author=&lt;!-- Staff --&gt;|work=[[CBC.ca]]|date=March 9, 2017|accessdate=May 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He starred in the ''[[Back to the Future (franchise)|Back to the Future]]'' trilogy where he portrayed [[Marty McFly]]. Other notable roles have included [[Mike Flaherty (Deputy Mayor)|Mike Flaherty]] on the [[American Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] sitcom ''[[Spin City]]'' (1996–2000) and his portrayal of [[Alex P. Keaton]] on the American sitcom ''[[Family Ties]]''. He has won five [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s, four [[Golden Globe Awards]], a [[Grammy Award]] and two [[Screen Actors Guild Awards]].

Fox was diagnosed with [[Parkinson's disease]] in 1991 at age 29, and disclosed his condition to the public in 1998. He partly retired from acting in 2000 as the symptoms of his disease worsened. He has since become an advocate for research toward finding a cure; he created the [[The Michael J. Fox Foundation|Michael J. Fox Foundation]], and Sweden's [[Karolinska Institutet]] gave him an ''honoris causa'' doctorate on March 5, 2010 for his work advocating a cure for Parkinson's disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.eonline.com/uberblog/b170318_michael_j_fox_gets_doctored.html |title=Michael J.

Since 1999, Fox has mainly worked as a voice-over actor in films such as ''[[Stuart Little (film)|Stuart Little]]'' and [[Disney]]'s ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]''. On the [[CBS]] TV show ''[[The Good Wife]]'', he earned Emmy nominations for three consecutive years for his recurring role as crafty attorney Louis Canning.&lt;ref name="GoodWife"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bobbin|first1=Jay|title='The Good Wife' Season 5: Emmy nominee Michael J.

==Early life==
Michael Andrew Fox was born on June 9, 1961, in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]], Canada, to Phyllis (''née'' Piper), an actress/payroll clerk, and William Fox, a police officer and [[Canadian Forces]] member.&lt;ref name="actors"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Michael J.

Fox's family lived in various cities and towns across Canada because of his father's career.&lt;ref name="actors"/&gt; Their family finally moved to [[Burnaby]], a large suburb of [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], when his father retired in 1971. His father died on January 6, 1990, from a heart attack.&lt;ref name=MikeBio&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.michaeljfox.org/foundation/michael-story.html |title=Michael J. Fox Biography |publisher=The Michael J Fox Foundation |date= |accessdate=August 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fox attended [[Burnaby Central Secondary School]], and now has a theatre named for him at [[Burnaby South Secondary]].&lt;ref name="Burnaby" /&gt; At age 15, Fox starred in the Canadian television series ''[[Leo and Me]]'', produced by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, and in 1979, at age 18, he moved to Los Angeles to further his acting career. Shortly after his marriage, he decided to move back to Vancouver.&lt;ref name="actors"/&gt; Fox is one of four members of the ''Leo and Me'' cast and crew who eventually developed Parkinson's disease in mid-life, an unusually high number that led to some investigation as to whether an environmental factor may have played a role.&lt;ref name="Atkins"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2002/apr/04/medicalscience.healthandwellbeing|title=Can you catch Parkinson's?|last=Atkins|first=Lucy|date=April 4, 2002|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=January 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rocca"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/64051_mjfox27ww.shtml|title=Michael J.

Fox was discovered by producer Ronald Shedlo and made his American television debut in the television film ''Letters from Frank'', credited under the name "Michael Fox." He intended to continue to use the name, but when he registered with the [[Screen Actors Guild]], which requires unique registration names to avoid credit ambiguities (and the possibility that royalty checks would be sent to the wrong actors), he discovered that [[Michael Fox (American actor)|Michael Fox]], a veteran [[character actor]], was already registered under the name.&lt;ref name="actors"/&gt; As he explained in his autobiography, ''Lucky Man: A Memoir'' and in interviews, he needed to come up with a different name. He did not like the sound of "Michael A. Fox" during a time when "fox" was coming to mean "attractive" and because his middle initial sounded too much like the [[Eh#Canada|Canadian "eh?"]] He also didn't like the sound of "Andrew" or "Andy," so he decided to adopt a new middle initial and settled on "J," as a tribute to actor [[Michael J. Pollard]].&lt;ref name=MikeBio /&gt;

==Acting career==

===Early career===

Fox|work=Television Academy}}&lt;/ref&gt; in August 1988 shortly after they were married]]

Fox's first feature film roles were ''[[Midnight Madness (film)|Midnight Madness]]'' (1980) and ''[[Class of 1984]]'' (1982), credited in both as Michael Fox. Shortly afterward, he began playing "Young Republican" [[Alex P. Keaton]] in the show ''[[Family Ties]]'', which aired on [[NBC]] for seven seasons from 1982–89. In an interview with [[Jimmy Fallon]] in April 2014, Fox stated he negotiated the role at a payphone at [[Pioneer Chicken]]. He received the role only after [[Matthew Broderick]] was unavailable.&lt;ref name=slate/&gt; ''Family Ties'' had been sold to the television network using the pitch "[[Hip (slang)|Hip]] parents, [[Square (slang)|square]] kids",&lt;ref name=slate&gt;{{cite web|last=Haglund |first=David |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/dvdextras/2007/03/reagans_favorite_sitcom.single.html |title=Reagan's Favorite Sitcom: How Family Ties spawned a conservative hero |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=March 2, 2007 |accessdate=January 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the parents originally intended to be the main characters. However, the positive reaction to Fox's performance led to his character becoming the focus of the show following the fourth episode.&lt;ref name=slate/&gt; At its peak, the audience for ''Family Ties'' drew one-third of America's households every week.&lt;ref name="actors" /&gt; Fox won three [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] awards for ''Family Ties'' in 1986, 1987, and 1988.&lt;ref name="Emmy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/award_history_search?person=michael+j+fox&amp;program=&amp;start_year=0&amp;end_year=2010&amp;network=All&amp;web_category=All&amp;winner=All|title=EMMY Award History|date=|publisher=EMMY Official Website|accessdate=August 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also won a [[Golden Globe Award]] in 1989.&lt;ref name="globes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldenglobes.com/person/michael-j-fox|title=Golden Globe Awards for Michael J. Fox|date=|publisher=Golden Globes Official Website|accessdate=April 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brandon Tartikoff]], one of the show's producers, felt that Fox was too short in relation to the actors playing his parents, and tried to have him replaced. Tartikoff reportedly said that "this is not the kind of face you'll ever find on a lunch-box." After his later successes, Fox presented Tartikoff with a custom-made lunch-box with the inscription "To Brandon, this is for you to put your [[eating crow|crow in]]. Love and Kisses, Michael J. Fox." Tartikoff kept the lunch-box in his office for the rest of his NBC career.&lt;ref name="LuckyMan"&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

While filming ''Family Ties'', Fox met his wife, [[Tracy Pollan]], who portrayed his girlfriend, Ellen.&lt;ref name="actors" /&gt; When Fox left the TV series ''[[Spin City]]'', his final episodes made numerous allusions to ''Family Ties'': [[Michael Gross (actor)|Michael Gross]] (who played Alex's father Steven) portrays Mike Flaherty's (Fox's character's) therapist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/mar/20/entertainment/ca-10674 |title=Putting His Own Spin on 'City's' Season Finale |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=March 20, 2000 |accessdate=August 23, 2010 | first=Amy | last=Wallace}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is a reference to an off-screen character named "[[Justine Bateman|Mallory]]".&lt;ref&gt;Shales, Tom.

Keaton, and in one episode [[Meredith Baxter]] played Mike's mother.

As a consequence of working in ''Family Ties'', as well as his acting in ''Teen Wolf'' and ''Back to the Future'', Fox became a [[teen idol]]. [[VH1]]'s show ''The Greatest'' later naming him among their "50 Greatest Teen Idols."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.vh1.com/shows/the_greatest/episode.jhtml?episodeID=67297|title = Episode 080: 50 Greatest Teen Idols|website = VH1|accessdate = October 21, 2015|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120209143618/http://www.vh1.com/shows/the_greatest/episode.jhtml?episodeID=67297|archivedate = February 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film career===
[[File:Michael J Fox 1988-cropped1.jpg|thumb|upright|Fox at the [[40th Primetime Emmy Awards]] in August 1988]]

In January 1985, Fox was cast to replace [[Eric Stoltz]] as [[Marty McFly]], a teenager who is accidentally sent [[Time travel|back in time]] from 1985 to 1955 in ''[[Back to the Future]]''.
[[Robert Zemeckis]], the director, originally wanted Fox to play Marty, but [[Gary David Goldberg]] the creator of ''[[Family Ties]]'', which Fox was working on at the time, refused to allow Zemeckis even to approach Fox as he felt that as [[Meredith Baxter]] was on maternity leave at the time, Fox's character [[Alex Keaton]] was needed to carry the show in her absence. Eric Stoltz was cast and was already filming ''Back to the Future'', but Zemeckis felt that Stoltz was not giving the right type of performance for the humor involved.&lt;ref name="Making"&gt;"Back to the Future: Making the Trilogy: Chapter 1 (DVD Documentary)"&lt;/ref&gt; Zemeckis quickly replaced Stoltz with Fox, whose schedule was now more open with the return of Meredith Baxter. He was considered for the role of Mark Kendall in ''[[Once Bitten (1985 film)|Once Bitten]]'', but it eventually went to [[Jim Carrey]]. During filming, Fox would rehearse for ''Family Ties'' from 10 a.m to 6 p.m, then rush to the ''Back to the Future'' set where he would rehearse and shoot until 2:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. This schedule lasted for two full months. ''Back to the Future'' was both a commercial and critical success. The film spent 8 consecutive weekends as the number-one grossing movie at the US box office in 1985 and eventually earned a worldwide total of $381.11 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=backtothefuture.htm |title=Back to the Future Box Office Mojo |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] |date= |accessdate=August 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' applauded the performances, stating that Fox and his co-star [[Christopher Lloyd]] imbued Marty and [[Emmett Brown|Doc Brown]]'s friendship with a quality reminiscent of [[King Arthur]] and [[Merlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work = Variety | url = http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117788826 | date = July 1, 1985 | title = Back to the Future | accessdate = October 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was later followed by two similarly-successful sequels, ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'' (1989) and ''[[Back to the Future Part III]]'' (1990).

During and immediately after the [[Back to the Future trilogy|''Back to the Future'' trilogy]], Fox starred in ''[[Teen Wolf]]'' (1985),'' [[Light of Day]]'' (1987), ''[[The Secret of My Success (1987 film)|The Secret of My Success]]'' (1987), ''[[Bright Lights, Big City (film)|Bright Lights, Big City]]'' (1988), and ''[[Casualties of War]]'' (1989).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ws5CDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2016-IA67&amp;lpg=PA2016-IA67&amp;dq=after+the+Back+to+the+Future+trilogy,+Fox+starred+in+Teen+Wolf+(1985),+Light+of+Day+(1987),+The+Secret+of+My+Success+(1987),+Bright+Lights,+Big+City+(1988),+and+Casualties+of+War+(1989).#v=onepage&amp;q=after%20the%20Back%20to%20the%20Future%20trilogy,%20Fox%20starred%20in%20Teen%20Wolf%20(1985),%20Light%20of%20Day%20(1987),%20The%20Secret%20of%20My%20Success%20(1987),%20Bright%20Lights,%20Big%20City%20(1988),%20and%20Casualties%20of%20War%20(1989).&amp;f=false|title=Focus On: 100 Most Popular Canadian Male Film Actors|last=contributors|first=Wikipedia|publisher=e-artnow sro|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Secret of My Success'', Fox played a recent graduate from [[Kansas State University]] who moves to New York City, where he has to deal with the ups and downs of the business world. The film was successful at the box office, grossing $110 million worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=secretofmysuccess.htm |title=The Secret of My Success Box Office Mojo |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|date= |accessdate=September 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] in ''The Chicago Sun Times'' wrote; "Fox provides a fairly desperate center for the film. It could not have been much fun for him to follow the movie's arbitrary shifts of mood, from sitcom to slapstick, from sex farce to boardroom brawls."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19870410/REVIEWS/704100301 |title=The Secret of My Success Review |work=[[Chicago Sun Times]] |date=April 10, 1987 |accessdate=September 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Bright Lights, Big City (film)|Bright Lights, Big City]]'', Fox played a fact-checker for a New York magazine, who spends his nights partying with alcohol and drugs. The film received mixed reviews, with Hal Hinson in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' criticizing Fox by claiming that "he was the wrong actor for the job".&lt;ref name="hinson"&gt;{{cite news | last = Hinson | first = Hal | title = ''City'' Blight | work = Washington Post | pages = | date = April 1, 1988 | url = | accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Roger Ebert praised the actor's performance: "Fox is very good in the central role (he has a long drunken monologue that is the best thing he has ever done in a movie)".&lt;ref name="ebert"&gt;{{cite news | last = Ebert | first = Roger | title = ''Bright Lights, Big City'' | work = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] | pages = | date = April 1, 1988 | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19880401/REVIEWS/804010301/1023 | accessdate = June 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the shooting of ''Bright Lights, Big City'', Fox co-starred again with [[Tracy Pollan]], his on-screen girlfriend from ''[[Family Ties]]''.

Fox then starred in ''[[Casualties of War]]'', a dark and violent war drama about the [[Vietnam War]], alongside [[Sean Penn]]. ''Casualties of War'' was not a major box office hit, but Fox, playing a private serving in [[Vietnam]], received good reviews for his performance. Don Willmott on film critic's website wrote; "Fox, only one year beyond his ''[[Family Ties]]'' sitcom silliness, rises to the challenges of acting as the film's moral voice and sharing scenes with the always intimidating Penn."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmcritic.com/reviews/1989/casualties-of-war/ |title=Casualties of War Review |publisher=Film Critic Website |date=January 4, 2006 |accessdate=September 1, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101113234717/http://www.filmcritic.com/reviews/1989/casualties-of-war/ |archivedate=November 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, he starred in ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'', a romantic comedy about a talented medical doctor who decides to become a plastic surgeon. While moving from Washington, D.C. to Los Angeles, he winds up as a doctor in a small southern town in South Carolina. [[Michael Caton-Jones]], from ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'', described Fox in the film as "at his frenetic best".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/65559/doc_hollywood.html |title=Doc Hollywood Review |work=Time Out |date= |accessdate=September 1, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118081240/http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/65559/doc_hollywood.html |archivedate=November 18, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Hard Way (1991 film)|The Hard Way]]'' was also released in 1991, with Fox playing an undercover actor learning from police officer [[James Woods]]. After being privately diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease in 1991 and being cautioned he had "ten good working years left", Fox hastily signed a three-film contract, appearing in ''[[For Love or Money (1993 film)|For Love or Money]]'' (1993), ''[[Life With Mikey]]'' (1993), and ''[[Greedy (film)|Greedy]]'' (1994).  The mid-1990s saw Fox play smaller supporting roles in ''[[The American President]]'' (1995) and ''[[Mars Attacks!]]'' (1996).&lt;ref name="actors"/&gt;

His last major film role was in ''[[The Frighteners]]'' (1996), directed by [[Peter Jackson]]. ''[[The Frighteners]]'' tells the story of Frank Bannister (Fox), an architect who develops psychic abilities allowing him to see, hear, and communicate with ghosts. After losing his wife, he uses his new abilities by cheating customers out of money for his "ghost hunting" business. However, a [[mass murder]]er comes back from Hell, prompting Frank to investigate the supernatural presence. Fox's performance received critical praise, [[Kenneth Turan]] in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote; "The film's actors are equally pleasing. Both Fox, in his most successful starring role in some time, and [Trini] [[Trini Alvarado|Alvarado]], who looks rather like Andie MacDowell here, have no difficulty getting into the manic spirit of things."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/reviews/cl-movie960719-3,0,6464899.story |title=The Frighteners Review |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=July 19, 1996 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091031053608/http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/reviews/cl-movie960719-3%2C0%2C6464899.story |archivedate=October 31, 2009 |accessdate=May 18, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fox started displaying symptoms of early-onset [[Parkinson's disease]] in 1991 while shooting the movie ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'', although he was not properly diagnosed until the next year.&lt;ref name="QuitsSpinCity" /&gt; After his diagnosis, Fox started drinking heavily.

In an interview with [[NPR]] in April 2002,&lt;ref name="NPR Fresh Air"/&gt; Fox explained what he does when he becomes symptomatic during an interview:

{{Quote|quote = Well, actually, I've been erring on the side of caution—I think 'erring' is actually the right word—in that I've been medicating perhaps too much, in the sense [that] ... the symptoms ... people see in some of these interviews that [I] have been on are actually [[dyskinesia]], which is a reaction to the medication. Because if I were purely symptomatic with Parkinson's symptoms, a lot of times speaking is difficult. There's a kind of a [[cluttering]] of speech and it's very difficult to sit still, to sit in one place. You know, the symptoms are different, so I'd rather kind of suffer the symptoms of dyskinesia... this kind of weaving and this kind of continuous thing is much preferable, actually, than pure Parkinson's symptoms. So that's what I generally do... I haven't had any, you know, problems with pure Parkinson's symptoms in any of these interviews, because I'll tend to just make sure that I have enough [[Sinemet]] in my system and, in some cases, too much. But to me, it's preferable. It's not representative of what I'm like in my everyday life. I get a lot of people with Parkinson's coming up to me saying, 'You take too much medication.' I say, 'Well, you sit across from [[Larry King]] and see if you want to tempt it.'

In 2006, Fox starred in a [[campaign ad]] for then [[State Auditor of Missouri]] [[Claire McCaskill]] (D) in her successful [[United States Senate election in Missouri, 2006|2006 Senate campaign]] against incumbent [[Jim Talent]] (R), expressing her support for embryonic [[stem cell]] research. In the ad, he visibly showed the effects of his Parkinson's disease:

{{Quote
 |quote = As you might know, I care deeply about stem cell research. In Missouri, you can elect Claire McCaskill, who shares my hope for cures. Unfortunately, Senator Jim Talent opposes expanding stem cell research. Senator Talent even wanted to criminalize the science that gives us the chance for hope. They say all politics is local, but that's not always the case. What you do in Missouri matters to millions of Americans, Americans like me.

''[[The New York Times]]'' called it "one of the most powerful and talked about political advertisements in years" and polls indicated that the commercial had a measurable impact on the way voters voted, in an election that McCaskill won.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/061026/26politicalwire.htm |title=The Michael J.

Fox recalled performing in role-playing simulations as part of police recruit training exercises at the Institute early in his career.

In 2016, his organization the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research created a raffle to raise awareness for Parkinson's disease and raised $6.75 million, with the help of [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] via two auctions, one in [[Hong Kong]] and the other in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/nike-mag-raffle-reportedly-raised-s675-million-for-parkinsons-research-news.24878.html?|title=The Michael J.

The '''Murabitun World Movement''' is an [[Islam]]ic movement founded by its current leader, [[Abdalqadir as-Sufi]] (born as Ian Dallas), with communities in several countries. Its heartland is Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrika Martensson, Jennifer Bailey, Priscilla Ringrose, Asbjorn Dyrendal, ''Fundamentalism in the Modern World Vol 2:Fundamentalism and Communication: Culture, Media and the Public Sphere'', ed. I.B.Tauris, 2011, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;  The number of its followers may amount, according to one estimate, to around 10,000.&lt;ref&gt;Oscar Perez Ventura, ''Movimientos Islamistas en Espana: el Movimiento Munidal Murabitun, conversos al Islam en Al-Andalus'', Instituto Espanol de Estudios Estrategos, 2012, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement's objectives include the restoration of [[Zakat]], [[dawah|Da’wa]] and the practice of ''bayat'' (allegiance) to an [[Emir|amir]]. It considers itself a [[tariqa]] in the [[Darqawa|Darqawi-Shadhili-Qadiri Tariqa]] tradition.{{Citation needed|date= May 2014}}

==Background==
The name Murabitun derives from the name of the [[Almoravid dynasty]]. The founder of the  Murabitun World Movement is [[Abdalqadir as-Sufi]], a convert to Islam born Ian Dallas in [[Ayr]], Scotland, in 1930. He met his first Shaykh, [[Muhammad ibn al-Habib]], in [[Meknes]] around 1968, and was made a ''[[muqaddam]]'' and given the title "as-Sufi". Ibn al-Habib said to him, “You can stay here with me, and something might happen. But go to England and see what will happen,”&lt;ref&gt;From “The new Murabitun” by Umar Ibrahim Vadillo, Yildiz Productions, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; and so he went to London and gathered a group of new British Muslims, returning to Morocco in 1970. He founded a learning centre in Bristol Gardens, London, in 1972, and another centre in [[Berkeley, California]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Abdalqadir as-Sufi travelled in Europe and America, held talks, and published works such as ''The Way of Muhammad''&lt;ref name="Way"&gt;[http://www.bewley.virtualave.net/Way.html The Way of Muhammad] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627164721/http://bewley.virtualave.net/Way.html |date=2010-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Islam Journal'' proposing that Islam could be understood, and entered, as the "completion of the Western intellectual and spiritual tradition".&lt;ref name="Way"/&gt; He also initiated translations into English of classical texts on Islamic law and Sufism, including the ''[[Muwatta Imam Malik]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bewley.virtualave.net/muwcont.html The Muwatta of Imam Malik] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101013110055/http://bewley.virtualave.net/muwcont.html |date=2010-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the letters of [[Muhammad al-Arabi al-Darqawi]], published as ''The Darqawi Way''.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In 1982 Abdalqadir as-Sufi held a series of talks in America which were to become the basis of his work, ''Root Islamic Education''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bewley.virtualave.net/Root.html Root Islamic Education] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627164618/http://bewley.virtualave.net/Root.html |date=2010-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideas==

===Position on ''zakat''===

The political and social work of the Murabitun centres around the restoration of the “fallen pillar”&lt;ref&gt;Bewley, Abdalhaqq, Zakat: raising a fallen pillar, Black Stone Press, UK, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; of ''zakat'', which, it is claimed, has been abandoned on several primary counts.

Principally:
# that it must be taken by an amir&lt;ref&gt;For example: "The zakat is fard and one of the fundamental matters of Islam, such that whoever denies that it is obligatory is a kafir." And "It is obligatory to pay zakat to the amir (Imam) if he is just. If he is not just and it is impossible to divert it from him, then one pays it to him and that discharges one's duty, but if it is possible to divert it from him then the person paying it should pay it to those who can validly receive it but it is recommended that one not undertake to pay it directly oneself for fear of praise." ''Al-Qawanin al-Fiqhiyya'', Ibn Juzayy al-Kalbi&lt;/ref&gt;
# that if it consists of money it must be taken in gold and/or silver&lt;ref name="illish"&gt;For example: Al-Fath al-‘Aliyy al-Malik fi al-Fatawi ‘ala Madhhab Malik, Shaykh Muhammad ‘Illish, Al-Azhar&lt;/ref&gt;
# that it must be disbursed immediately.

As their authority for this position the Murabitun cite a wide range of sources, beginning with the Qur'anic injunction to take ''zakat'',&lt;ref&gt;“Take zakat from their wealth” Surat Tawba 9:103&lt;/ref&gt; the Prophetic practice of ''zakat''-taking, the well-known position of the Khalif Abu Bakr as-Siddiq,&lt;ref&gt;"Fight them if they retain only a hobbling-rope of what was collected before." Al-Bukhari in his Sahih in the Book of Zakat, in the chapter on the obligatory nature of ''zakat''.&lt;/ref&gt; and the established practice among the world Muslim community which was until relatively recently the assessment and collection of ''zakat'' by the Leader and his collectors.

This they place in contradistinction to the currently prevailing practices of voluntary self-assessment, donation to the ''zakat'' charity of one’s choice, and the placement of ''zakat'' donations into interim or even long-term investment funds. This, they argue, destroys the political cohesion of the Muslim community, which is based primarily on the circulation of wealth along divinely revealed lines.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2001"&gt;Shaykh Abdalqadir as-Sufi, Sultaniyya, Madinah Press 2001&lt;/ref&gt; They also condemn ''zakat'' investment funds as un-Islamic.

===Shari‘ah currency===

They previously connected their position on ''zakat'' with promotion of the Islamic gold dinar and silver dirham, which was developed above all by the scholar Umar Ibrahim Vadillo. Paper money, since actually a promise of payment written on paper, can from the point of view of ''zakat'' only be considered in terms of its value as paper,&lt;ref name="illish"/&gt; since ''zakat'' cannot be discharged by passing on a token of debt owed to a third party. Vadillo has written extensively&lt;ref&gt;A fatwa on banking in Islam by Umar Ibrahim Vadillo is available here,  [http://www.shaykhabdalqadir.com/content/articles/FatwaOnBanking.pdf Fatwa on Banking] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813214551/http://www.shaykhabdalqadir.com/content/articles/FatwaOnBanking.pdf |date=2007-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; on the origins of paper money and the Islamic position on money.

The Murabitun traced the [[Bimetallism|bi-metallic]] currency back to Muhammad and the first Muslim community; its specific weights and purities were formally recorded by ‘Umar Ibn al-Khattab.&lt;ref&gt;At-Taratib al-Idariyya, Shaykh al-Kattaani&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abu Bakr ibn Abi Maryam reported that he heard the Muhammed say: "A time is certainly coming over mankind in which there will be nothing [left] which will be of use save a dinar and a dirham."
(The Musnad of Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal)&lt;/ref&gt; They also cited the dinar’s mention in the Qur'an,&lt;ref&gt;“But there are others among them who, if you entrust them with just a single dinar, will not return it to you.” Surat Al‘Imran 3:74&lt;/ref&gt; its use in the universally accepted ''fiqh'' to define the terms of ''zakat'', and its mention as currency throughout the entire body of Islamic ''fiqh''.{{Citation needed|date= May 2014}}
In February 2014, however, Shaykh Dr. Abdalqadir as-Sufi distanced himself from the dinar and dirham movement, saying, "So, I now dis-associate myself from all activity involving the Islamic gold dinar and silver dirham".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shaykhabdalqadir.com/the-islamic-dinar-a-way-stage-passed/ "THE ISLAMIC DINAR – A WAY-STAGE PASSED" Shaykh Dr. Abdalqadir as-Sufi]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amirate, sultaniyya and caliphate===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Murabitun South Africa.jpg|thumb|Shaykh Abdalqadir as-Sufi gathered with the Amirs and members of the Murabitun in South Africa]] --&gt;
The Murabitun advocate personal rule as the Islamic and indeed natural form of human governance,&lt;ref&gt;''Sultaniyya'' is a modern statement on leadership in Islam. Abdalqadir surveys Islam under the chapter headings Deen, Dawla (polity), Waqf, Trade, the Sultan — personal rule — and Tasawwuf. (Madinah Press, Cape Town, 2002, OCLC: 50875888)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://66.49.205.6/books/Sultaniyya.pdf Sultaniyya] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927201756/http://66.49.205.6/books/Sultaniyya.pdf |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; taking authority for this position from extensive Qur'anic references.&lt;ref&gt;Surat An-Nisa 4:58&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Shahada in Soweto Mosque.jpg|thumb|A young man recites the Shahada in the Soweto Mosque]] --&gt;

===‘Amal Ahl al-Madinah===

Abdalqadir as-Sufi's advocacy of Malik’s [[Maliki|school of Madinah]] is explained at length in his work ''Root Islamic Education''. The Murabitun do not, however, in any way dispute the validity of the other legal schools,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shaykhabdalqadir.com/content/audio.html Discourse on the Four Madh'habs by Abdalhaqq Bewley] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212021251/http://www.shaykhabdalqadir.com/content/audio.html |date=2007-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; nor is adherence to or advocacy of the ''madhhab'' of Malik a condition of membership of the Murabitun.

===Islamic trading and social welfare===

The Murabitun advocate a revival of the forms of trading and social welfare practiced during the first generations of Muslims and for most of the history of Islam, proposing that these are the natural modes of human activity and rejecting the dialectical categorisation of “ancient” or “modern”, a set of opposites whose application to Islam they consider irrelevant and misleading.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Dallas, The Time of the Bedouin, Budgate Press 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

These models have been formulated in detail and include ''awqaf''&lt;ref name="autogenerated2001"/&gt; for the funding of social welfare institutions, mosques and other public facilities.

===Position against terrorism===

Abdalqadir as-Sufi has consistently identified terrorism and suicide tactics as forbidden in and alien to Islam, and indeed as a phenomenon with no precursor in Muslim history. Instead, he states that its original appearance as a tactic and a psychology was among the Isma‘ili sect of Shi‘a Islam, and that it later emerged among the Russian nihilists of the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shaykhabdalqadir.com/content/articles/Art001_17022004.html Fatwa on Suicide as a Tactic, Madinah Press 2004.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070518183229/http://www.shaykhabdalqadir.com/content/articles/Art001_17022004.html |date=2007-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizational form==

[[File:Jumuah Mosque CT.gif|thumb|300px|The Jumua Mosque of Cape Town, established by Abdalqadir as-Sufi and members of the Murabitun]]

The Murabitun organise themselves around amirs. This is distinct from the role of the movement’s founder, Abdalqadir as-Sufi, who, while exercising an undoubted influence, is a spiritual guide rather than a political leader – an arrangement common throughout the history of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;The Ottoman Empire 1300-1600 by Halil Inalcik, Orion, 2000, {{ISBN|1-84212-442-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Abdallah ibn Yasin]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Lubbock, Texas]], Maines considers herself a rebel who "loved not thinking in the way I knew the majority of people thought."&lt;ref name="Heysen"&gt;Heysen, Kristen. (October 8, 2006) [http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,22606,20541859-5006343,00.html Not ready to make nice] AdelaideNow. Retrieved April 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, after leaving [[Berklee College of Music]], Maines was recruited by the Dixie Chicks to replace their lead singer, [[Laura Lynch]]. With Maines as lead vocalist, the band earned 10 [[Country Music Association Awards]] and 13 [[Grammy Award]]s for their work between 1998 and 2007.

In 2006, with Maines still acting as lead singer, the Dixie Chicks released ''[[Taking the Long Way]]''. The album subsequently won five [[Grammy Awards]] (including [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]]).

Maines released her solo album, ''[[Mother (Natalie Maines album)|Mother]]'', on May 7, 2013.

== Early life ==
Maines was born in [[Lubbock, Texas]], to country musician and producer [[Lloyd Maines]] and his wife Tina May Maines. She attended Williams Elementary School in Lubbock where her second grade teacher recalls being told by Maines during a math lesson, "Teacher, I don't need to learn this stuff—I'm gonna be a star."&lt;ref name="Dickerson, p. ???"&gt;Dickerson, '''p. ???'''&lt;/ref&gt; Maines was a cheerleader while attending O. L. Slaton Junior High School,&lt;ref name="Dickerson, p. ???"/&gt;  and graduated in 1992 from [[Lubbock High School]] where she had participated in the school [[choir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amc-music.com/musicmaking/play@school/artists.htm |title=Play at School |publisher=American Music Conference |accessdate=April 15, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928211031/http://www.amc-music.com/musicmaking/play@school/artists.htm |archivedate=September 28, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Maines has described growing up in conservative [[Texas]], saying "I always rebelled against that. My parents sent me and my sister to public minority schools so I always felt like a hippie and a rebel. ... As a teenager I always loved not thinking in the way I knew the majority of people thought. I always stood up for minorities. ... I've always stood up for homosexuals. I just always had these really strong convictions about doing so."&lt;ref name="Heysen"/&gt;

Following the completion of high school, Maines attended several colleges. She spent two semesters pursuing an undeclared major at [[West Texas A&amp;M University|West Texas A&amp;M]] where her studies focused heavily on radio, then a year and a half at [[South Plains College]]. One of Maines's instructors at South Plains, and a former member of [[The Maines Brothers Band]], Cary Banks, recalled "She was mostly into [[rock'n'roll]], [[rhythm and blues]] ... [[alternative rock]]." When Banks encountered Maines on campus, he said that she usually needed to vent a little steam. "She would get into a lot of political arguments" at the predominantly Republican school, and was a fan of Texas Governor [[Ann Richards]]. "She's always been opinionated and hardheaded like her dad."&lt;ref name="Dickerson, p. ???"/&gt;  In December 1994, Maines auditioned for and received a full vocal scholarship to Berklee College of Music. She pursued the diploma program at Berklee but dropped out before the completion of her studies. Even though Maines is from Lubbock, home of [[Texas Tech University]], she attended only one class at the school, a 1995 summer course in "Introductory Wildlife".&lt;ref name="Dickerson, p. ???"/&gt;

== Career ==
Maines's first commercially released work was [[backing vocalist|background vocals]] on [[Pat Green]]'s debut album, ''Dancehall Dreamer'', produced by her father Lloyd Maines and released in 1995. At the end of 1995, at age 21, Maines joined the all-female [[country music]] band, the [[Dixie Chicks]], which had been performing since 1989, but which had been unsuccessful in gaining more than local attention. Maines replaced founding lead singer Laura Lynch.  She plays guitar and bass in concert in the band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Davis, Rob |url=http://dixiechicksfaq.homestead.com/files/chicks.htm#_28.__What |title=Dixie Chicks FAQ No.&amp;nbsp;30 |accessdate=April 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maines co-wrote four tracks for the Dixie Chicks' first three albums, including the ''[[Billboard charts|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks]] chart number one hit "[[Without You (Dixie Chicks song)|Without You]]" on ''[[Fly (Dixie Chicks album)|Fly]]''. Maines was a primary songwriter on all 14 tracks of the band's 2006 album ''[[Taking the Long Way]]'' which peaked on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart at No.&amp;nbsp;1. ''Taking the Long Way'' has the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] single "[[Not Ready to Make Nice]]", (Maines, Strayer, Erwin, Wilson) hitting No.&amp;nbsp;4&lt;ref name="Billboard"&gt;{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=dixie chicks|chart=all}} |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929125545/http://{{billboardurlbyname|artist=dixie/ |archivedate=September 29, 2007 |title=Dixie Chicks: Singles |publisher=''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' |accessdate=June 17, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and for which the band won the songwriting Grammy Award, for [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]]. Maines considers the songwriting she did for ''Taking the Long Way'' "pure therapy" after the controversy that ensued over a comment Maines made from the stage in London that criticized U.S. President [[George W. Bush]].&lt;ref name="Burkeman"&gt;{{cite news |author=Burkeman, Oliver |date=March 25, 2006 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/usa/story/0,,1739311,00.html |title=Dixie Chicks turn death threats to song |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=March 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Everything felt more personal this time", Maines said about the album, "there's just more maturity, depth, intelligence. ... [These songs] feel more grown-up."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Cohen, Jonathan |date=March 10, 2006 |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/59125/dixie-chicks-get-personal-on-long-way |title=Dixie Chicks Get Personal On 'Long Way' |publisher=''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' |accessdate=June 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maines collaborates with other musical artists, both as a member of the Dixie Chicks and an individual singer. The Dixie Chicks first worked with [[Sheryl Crow]] in 1999 while performing for the concert tour [[Lilith Fair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Rosen, Craig |date=December 3, 1999 |url=http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12032703 |title=Dixie Chicks And Sheryl Crow Prove They're Gutsy Women |publisher=Yahoo!Music |accessdate=June 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the Dixie Chicks have worked with Crow on her ''[[Sheryl Crow and Friends: Live from Central Park]]'' album, a Crow remixed version of "[[Landslide (Fleetwood Mac song)|Landslide]]" performed by the Chicks, and the Dixie Chicks' song "Favorite Year" from ''Taking the Long Way''.  Maines has performed with artists including Pat Green, [[Charlie Robison]], [[Yellowcard]], [[Stevie Nicks]], [[Patty Griffin]], [[Neil Diamond]], [[Eddie Vedder]], [[Pete Yorn]] and [[Ben Harper]].

Maines is a friend of [[Howard Stern]] and has made several appearances on [[The Howard Stern Show|his show]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.howardstern.com/rundown.hs?d=1274673600 |title=A jewel of an interview – The Howard Stern Show |publisher=Howardstern.com |date=May 24, 2010 |accessdate=February 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 7, 2013, Maines released a solo album entitled ''[[Mother (Natalie Maines album)|Mother]]''.&lt;ref name="tasteofcountry.com"&gt;http://tasteofcountry.com/dixie-chicks-natalie-maines-pink-floyd-mother-video/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="twitter.com"&gt;https://twitter.com/1NatalieMaines/status/281263948551057408&lt;/ref&gt; This was Maines's first album since the Dixie Chicks hiatus started in 2007. The album was co-produced by [[Ben Harper]]. The album contains Maines's interpretation of several cover songs, including [[Pink Floyd]]'s [[Mother (Pink Floyd song)|"Mother"]], [[Eddie Vedder]]'s "Without You", and [[Jeff Buckley]]'s "Lover, You Should've Come Over". She also sings about motherhood, [[feminism]], and painful relationships.&lt;ref name="tasteofcountry.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="twitter.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Natalie Maines: A Country-Music Rebel Rocks On Her Own|url=http://wunc.org/post/natalie-maines-country-music-rebel-rocks-her-own|publisher=North Carolina Public Radio|accessdate=June 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Listen: Natalie Maines, 'Mother'|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/04/28/179030765/first-listen-natalie-maines-mother|publisher=NPR Music|accessdate=June 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Natalie Maines: A Dixie Chick Declares War on Nashville |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/natalie-maines-a-dixie-chick-declares-war-on-nashville-20130530|publisher=Rolling Stone|accessdate=June 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public statements and controversy ==
While lead singer for the Dixie Chicks, Maines has encountered several situations of a [[controversial]] nature. In August 2002, Maines criticized fellow country musician [[Toby Keith]]'s song "[[Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue (The Angry American)|Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue]]". In March 2003, Maines commented that the Dixie Chicks were "ashamed the President of the United States is from Texas."&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;

=== Feud with Toby Keith ===
Maines had a public feud with fellow country music star Toby Keith over the 2002 chart-topping country hit "Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue", as well as a comment Maines made about U.S. President George W. Bush during a March 2003 Dixie Chicks concert in London.

Maines publicly criticized Keith's song "Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue" by saying, "I hate it. It's ignorant, and it makes country music sound ignorant. It targets an entire culture—and not just the bad people who did bad things. You've got to have some tact. Anybody can write, 'We'll put a boot in your ass.'"&lt;ref&gt;''LA Daily News''.

After Maines commented at a March 2003 Dixie Chicks concert at the Shepherd's Bush Empire theatre in London that the Chicks didn't want the [[Iraq War]] and were "ashamed" President Bush "was from Texas", Keith's 2003 "[[Shock'n Y'all]]" tour began displaying a backdrop showing a doctored photo of Maines with Iraqi dictator [[Saddam Hussein]].&lt;ref name="BBCfreshrow"&gt;BBC News.

In August 2003, Keith publicly declared that he was done feuding with Maines, explaining, "You know, a best friend of mine ... lost a two-year-old daughter to cancer. ... [Recently] I saw ... a picture of me and Natalie and it said, 'Fight to the Death' or something. It seemed so insignificant. I said, 'Enough is enough.' ...

In the 2006 documentary ''[[Dixie Chicks: Shut Up and Sing]]'', backstage footage prior to her appearance wearing the F.U.T.K. shirt recorded the conversation between Maines and Simon Renshaw and confirmed that the original intent of the shirt was, in fact, a shot at Keith in response to his criticism of her: the letters stood for "Fuck You Toby Keith".&lt;ref name="Kopple"/&gt; As of January 2007, Keith continues to refuse to say Maines's name and argues that the doctored photo was intended to express his feeling that Maines's criticism was tyrannical and a dictator-like attempt to squelch Keith's free speech.&lt;ref&gt;Guzman, Rafer.

During the lead-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the Dixie Chicks performed on March 10, 2003, at [[Shepherd's Bush Empire]] theatre in London, the first concert stop on their [[Top of the World Tour]]. Prior to performing their song "Travelin' Soldier", the band gave an introductory monologue during which Maines said:

A review of the concert published in ''[[The Guardian]]'' abbreviated Maines's comment to read, "Just so you know ... we're ashamed the President of the United States is from Texas."&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; This abbreviated statement became widely circulated by the media.

Maines's comment, as abbreviated, provoked controversy and anger from some country music fans, and the Dixie Chicks were subsequently denounced by Bush supporters. Country music radio stations boycotted Dixie Chicks music. Scattered protests at which people destroyed Dixie Chicks' CDs occurred. Concerns arose that the Dixie Chicks impending US leg of the [[Top of the World Tour]], slated to start May 1 in [[South Carolina]], would see a lack of fans.&lt;ref name="Mattingly"&gt;Mattingly, David.

On March 12, the Dixie Chicks website posted a statement that read, "We've been overseas for several weeks and have been reading and following the news accounts of our government's position. The anti-American sentiment that has unfolded here is astounding." Maines added to the statement,&lt;blockquote&gt;I feel the president is ignoring the opinions of many in the U.S. and alienating the rest of the world. ... My comments were made in frustration and one of the privileges of being an American is you are free to voice your own point of view. ... While we support our troops, there is nothing more frightening than the notion of going to war with Iraq and the prospect of all the innocent lives that will be lost.&lt;ref&gt;TheBostonChannel.com.

A further statement was released on March 14: "As a concerned American citizen, I apologize to President Bush because my remark was disrespectful. I feel that whoever holds that office should be treated with the utmost respect." Maines continued by expressing her discontent regarding the impending war, &lt;blockquote&gt;We are currently in Europe and witnessing a huge anti-American sentiment as a result of the perceived rush to war. While war may remain a viable option, as a mother, I just want to see every possible alternative exhausted before children and American soldiers' lives are lost. I love my country. I am a proud American&lt;ref&gt;CNN. (14 March 2003) [http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/Music/03/14/dixie.chicks.apology/index.html Dixie Chicks singer apologizes for Bush comment].

[[File:Natalie-Maines by Ron Baker 2006.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Maines performing with the Dixie Chicks during their "[[Accidents &amp; Accusations Tour]]" December 4, 2006]]
At the first US concert after Maines's comment, she is quoted as saying from the stage, "They told me that you may not come, but I knew you'd come because we have the greatest fans in the whole wide world."&lt;ref name="DemocracyNow"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mattingly"/&gt; Despite fan turnout at concerts, the Dixie Chicks began receiving death threats as circulation of the comment increased. Subsequently, security was heightened at all concert venues and metal detectors were installed where possible.&lt;ref name="Burkeman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BBC. (April 24, 2003) [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2972043.stm Dixie Chicks 'get death threats']. Retrieved March 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; A death threat directed at Maines was received prior to the Chicks' concert of July 6, 2003, in [[Dallas, Texas]]. Maines described the threat as "scary because ... it wasn't just somebody wanting to write a hate letter. ... It was somebody who obviously thought they had a plan." Security was heightened for the trip to and from the concert venue as well as at the arena.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press. (May 11, 2006) [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12745436/ Dixie Chicks recall death threat] MSNBC.com. Retrieved March 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 21, 2006, while promoting the release of the album ''[[Taking the Long Way]]'', Maines recanted her 2003 apology to President Bush, saying, "I don't feel that way anymore. I don't feel he is owed any respect whatsoever. ... If people are going to ask me to apologize based on who I am ... I don't know what to do about that. I can't change who I am."&lt;ref name="Tryangiel"&gt;Tryangiel, Josh. (May 21, 2006) [https://archive.is/20121206045558/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/printout/0,8816,1196419,00.html Chicks In the Line of Fire]. Retrieved March 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maines says she is not looking for more battles but that "The Incident", as it is referred to by the Chicks, reminded her of how she "felt in high school: to be angry, to be sure that you're right and that the things you do matter. You don't realize that you're not feeling those feelings until you do. And then you realize how much more interesting life is."&lt;ref name="Tryangiel"/&gt;

Two 2006 documentaries, ''[[Protesting the Dixie Chicks]]'' and ''[[Dixie Chicks: Shut Up and Sing|Shut Up And Sing]]'', deal with the controversy surrounding Maines's comment and the ensuing fallout. The Dixie Chicks continue to discuss the matter. In an interview with ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' on June 15, 2006, regarding the fallout from her comment, Maines again stirred up controversy by stating&lt;blockquote&gt;The entire country may disagree with me, but I don't understand the necessity for patriotism; Why do you have to be a patriot? About what? This land is our land? Why? You can like where you live and like your life, but as for loving the whole country ... I don't see why people care about patriotism.&lt;ref&gt;Sweeting, Adam. (15 June 2006) [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2006/06/15/bmdixie15.xml How the Chicks survived their scrap with Bush] ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''. Retrieved 18 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2007, the Dixie Chicks won three Grammys for "[[Not Ready to Make Nice]]" and two Grammys for ''Taking the Long Way'', receiving all five Grammys for which they were nominated. This was seen by some as vindication for the Dixie Chicks, who were shunned by country radio programmers after Maines's remarks about President Bush. As the Dixie Chicks accepted the album of the year award, Maines said, "I think people are using their freedom of speech with all these awards. We get the message."&lt;ref name="Moody"&gt;Moody, Nekesa Mumbi. (February 12, 2007) However, the real message appeared to be that their career in country music was over. No other mainstream country artist since has dared uttering similar anti-American proclamations on foreign soil.

=== West Memphis Three lawsuit ===
Maines and the other Dixie Chicks participated in a rally in Little Rock, Arkansas, in late 2007, in support of the [[West Memphis Three]], three imprisoned men convicted of the 1993 murder of three young boys in [[West Memphis, Arkansas]].  At the rally, Maines made statements claiming new DNA evidence implicated Terry Hobbs, stepfather of one of the slain boys, and also posted a note about the presumed new evidence on the Dixie Chicks' website.&lt;ref name="dcx-wm3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dixiechicks.com/06_pressDetail.asp?newsID=669 |title=Letter from Natalie Maines: WM3 Call to Action |publisher=Dixiechicks.com |date=November 26, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313021526/http://www.dixiechicks.com/06_pressDetail.asp?newsID=669 |archivedate=March 13, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hobbs responded by filing a [[lawsuit]] claiming compensatory and [[punitive damages]] for "loss of income, injury to his reputation and emotional distress."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dixie Chicks singer sued for defamation |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081205/ap_en_mu/people_natalie_maines |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208235221/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081205/ap_en_mu/people_natalie_maines |archivedate=December 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b71845_natalie_maines_fellow_dixie_chicks.html|title=Natalie Maines, Fellow Dixie Chicks Courted for Libel|author=Finn, Natalie|publisher=[[E!]]|date=December 4, 2008|accessdate=December 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suit was dismissed, however, in December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1627453/defamation-suit-against-dixie-chicks-natalie-maines-dismissed.jhtml |title=Defamation Suit Against Dixie Chicks' Natalie Maines Dismissed |date=December 2, 2009 |publisher=CMT.com |accessdate=December 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 19, 2011, Maines joined with [[Pearl Jam]] frontman [[Eddie Vedder]] in Jonesboro, Arkansas, supporting the release of the West Memphis Three.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

'''Nayakas of Keladi''', also known as '''Nayakas of Bednore''' and '''Kings of Ikkeri''' (1499–1763), were an [[India]]n [[dynasty]] based from [[Keladi]] in [[Shimoga district]], [[Karnataka]], [[India]]. They were an important ruling dynasty in [[History of Karnataka|post-medieval Karnataka]]. They initially ruled as a vassal of the famous [[Vijayanagar Empire]]. After the fall of the empire in 1565, they gained independence and ruled significant parts of [[Malnad]] region of the [[Western Ghats]] in present-day Karnataka, most areas in the [[Kanara|coastal regions of Karnataka]], and parts of northern [[Kerala]], [[Malabar region|Malabar]] and the central plains along the [[Tungabhadra river|Tungabhadra]] river. In 1763 AD, with their defeat to [[Hyder Ali]], they were absorbed into the [[Kingdom of Mysore]]. They played an important part in the history of Karnataka,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bK4Ba6824koC&amp;pg=PA128&amp;lpg=PA128&amp;dq=marcupa+chitty&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cljU2v67iB&amp;sig=2z4I_Zh3GFqJJ1pWsyjr3BTyFXE&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=kilidi&amp;f=false |title=A journey from Madras through the ... – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.in |date= |accessdate=2011-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; during a time of confusion and fragmentation that generally prevailed in [[South India]] after the fall of the Vijayanagar Empire.

==The Nayaka clan==
Chaudappa Nayaka, originally ''Chauda Gowda'', (1499–1530), was from a village called ''Pallibailu'' near [[Keladi (India)|Keladi]]. He was the son of [[Lingayat]] couple ''Basavappa'' and ''Basavamambe'', who were into farming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gazetteer.kar.nic.in/gazetteer/pdf/1975-26-0/Shimoga_1975_Chapter2_History.pdf | title=History of Shimoga District, page 16 | publisher=District Gazette of Shimoga, Gazetteer Department, Government of Karnataka | accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the earliest chieftain to rule the area surrounding [[Shimoga]], rose through self capability and acumen and was a feudatory of [[Vijayanagara Empire]].

Sadashiva Nayaka (1530–1566)&lt;ref name="Gold Coins of the World"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=TlnoMdZu40UC&amp;pg=PA469&amp;lpg=PA469&amp;dq=bednore+nayakas&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NvpqYnnM09&amp;sig=8vBny3hsERwHIVwX_Crfkc0pLoQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ilqSVbK7DISzuASKo4O4CA&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=bednore%20nayakas&amp;f=false | title=Sadashiva Nayaka reign | accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an important chieftain in the Vijayanagar Empire and earned the title ''Kotekolahala'' from emperor [[Aliya Rama Raya]] for his heroics in the battle of Kalyani.
The coastal provinces of Karnataka came under his direct rule. He moved the capital to [[Ikkeri]] some 20&amp;nbsp;km. from [[Keladi]].

Sankanna Nayaka (1566–1570), succeeded Sadashiva Nayaka.

Chikka Sankanna Nayaka (1570–1580) was an opportunistic ruler who took advantage of the confusion in the Vijayanagar Empire following its defeat at Tallikota and grabbed a few provinces in Uttara Kannada district.

Rama Raja Nayaka (1580–1586)

Hiriya Venkatappa Nayaka (1586–1629) is considered by scholars as ablest monarch of the clan. He completely freed himself from the overlordship of the relocated Vijayanagar rulers of Penugonda. Italian traveller [[Pietro Della Valle]], who visited his kingdom in 1623, called him an able soldier and administrator. In his reign the kingdom expanded so that it covered coastal regions, [[Malnad]] regions, and some regions to the east of the [[western Ghats]] of present-day Karnataka. He is also known to have defeated the Adilshahis of [[Bijapur Sultanate|Bijapur]] in Hanagal. Though a [[Virashaiva]] by faith, he built many temples for [[Vaishnavas]] and Jains and a mosque for Muslims. He defeated the Portuguese in 1618 and 1619.&lt;ref&gt;Portuguese Studies Review (ISSN 1057-1515) (Baywolf Press) p.34&lt;/ref&gt;

Virabhadra Nayaka (1629–1645) faced many troubles from the start, including competition from rival Jain chieftains of Malenad for the throne of Ikkeri and invasion by the Sultanate armies of Bijapur. Ikkeri was plundered by the Bijapur army during his time.

[[Shivappa Nayaka]]  (1645–1660) is widely considered as the ablest and greatest of the Keladi rulers. He was the uncle of Virabhadra Nayaka. Shivappa deposed his nephew to gain the throne of Keladi. He was not only an able administrator; he also patronised literature and fine arts. His successful campaigns against the Bijapur sultans, the Mysore kings, the Portuguese, and other Nayakas of the neighbouring territories east of the [[western ghats]] helped expand the kingdom to its greatest extent, covering large areas of present-day Karnataka. He gave importance to agriculture and developed new schemes for collection of taxes and revenues which earned him much praise from later British officials. A statue of him and the palace built by him containing many artifacts of his times are reminders of the respect he has earned even from the present generation of people of the region. He destroyed the Portuguese political power in the [[Kanara]] region by capturing all the Portuguese forts of the coastal region.&lt;ref&gt;Portuguese Studies Review (ISSN 1057-1515) (Baywolf Press) p.35&lt;/ref&gt;

Chikka Venkatappa Nayaka (1660–1662), ruled for a short span of time after Shivappa Nayaka.

Bhadrappa Nayaka (1662–1664), succeeded Chikka Venkatappa Nayaka.

Somashekara Nayaka I (1664–1672) The King who was once a good administrator, gave up his interest in administration after his associastion with a dancer named Kalavati. Bharame Mavuta, a relative of Kalavati slow poisoned the king which eventually led to his death.

[[Keladi Chennamma]] (1672–1697) She was an able ruler who some scholars claim was allied with the Maratha [[Shivaji]] and later his son Sambhaji to defeat all rival claimants to the throne. She gave shelter to Chhatrapathi Rajaram when he fled from the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] army. Chennamma of Keladi is well remembered by local people through tales of her bravery.

Basavappa Nayaka (1697–1714) He was a brave ruler and was adopted by Rani Chennammaji from their relative

Somashekara Nayaka II (1714–1739)

Kiriya Basavappa Nayaka (1739–1754)

Chenna Basappa Nayaka (1754–1757)

Queen Virammaji (1757–1763) was defeated by Hyder Ali who merged the Keladi kingdom with the [[Kingdom of Mysore]]. The queen was captured by Hyder Ali and was kept in confinement along with her son in the fort of Madugiri.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Advanced Study in the History of Modern India 1707-1813 by Jaswant Lal Mehta p.458&lt;/ref&gt; They were however rescued in 1767 when [[Madhavrao I]] of the [[Maratha Empire]] defeated Hyder Ali in the battle of Madugiri. Later, they were sent to Pune the capital of the Maratha Empire for protection.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Decline and the end==
For more than two hundred years the kingdom controlled the coastal and malnad regions of present-day Karnataka and fostered a rich tradition of trade with the English, the Portuguese, and the Dutch. However, in the period of gloom brought about by the fall of the last great Hindu empire, the Vijayanagar empire, constant wars—campaigns against local chieftains and the [[Mysore Kingdom]] and the harassment of the [[Marathas]] finally drained the treasury and resulted in the end of the kingdom.

The Keladi Nayakas built some fine temples in Ikkeri and Keladi using a combination of late [[Kadamba Dynasty|Kadamba]], [[Hoysala]], [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagar]], and [[Dravidian architecture|Dravida]] styles. The use of granite for their construction shows they simply followed the Vijayanagar model of architecture. The Aghoreshwara temple at Ikkeri and the Rameshwara temple at Keladi are the best examples of the Nayakas' art. Vijayanagar-style pillars with hippogryphs are common; called ''yali'' columns (depiction of horses and lions as seen in [[Hampi]]) is found here. These are pillars with lions, either with their forepaws raised or simply in a sitting position, and pillars with a mythical horse-like animal with front legs raised, balancing on its rear legs, and with an armed rider on its back which are worth seeing at Ikkeri. A roof sculpture depicting a [[Gandaberunda]], the mythical two-headed bird of Karnataka, is found in Keladi. Also, in the Rameshwara temple, a pillar sculpture shows Maratha Rajaram with Keladi Chennamma (history has it that Rajaram was protected by the queen when he was on the run from the Mughals).

==Religious tolerance==
The Keladi Nayakas were [[Lingayatism|Lingayats]], patronized the religion, constructed numerous mutts and were responsible for the spread of [[Lingayatism]] to the [[Malenadu]] and [[Coastal Karnataka]].&lt;ref name="Rulers of Keladi"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=R84n-Wv1S-8C&amp;pg=PA396&amp;lpg=PA396&amp;dq=keladi+nayaka+veerashaiva&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gkm7mxbz3p&amp;sig=_LtFqMSxgqB-QgvnBkGmqc-bQXc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iPNeVb7BJYeIuAT78oKoAw&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=keladi%20nayaka%20veerashaiva&amp;f=false | title=Keladi Nayakas - Shivappa Nayaka and Chennamma, Community Dominance and Political Modernisation: The Lingayats | publisher=Shankaragouda Hanumanthagouda Patil | work=Mittal Publications | accessdate=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/Though-a-minority-they-make-their-presence-felt/articleshow/17211015.cms | title=Though a minority, they make their presence felt | publisher=The Times of India | accessdate=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lingayatreligion.com/Lingayat/Murugi_Matha.htm | title=Sri Jagadguru Murugharajendra Brihanmath Chitradurga | accessdate=22 May 2015 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150528050216/http://lingayatreligion.com/Lingayat/Murugi_Matha.htm | archivedate=28 May 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=wJwIAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA355&amp;dq=Sivappa+nayaka+lingayat&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMIvYn6m7uXxwIVkByOCh06JQJX#v=onepage&amp;q=Sivappa%20nayaka%20lingayat&amp;f=false | title=Mysore and Coorg, a gazetteer - Keladi | publisher=Benjamin Lewis Rice | accessdate=7 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There were sixty four mutts in the district of [[Dakshina Kannada]] alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newskarnataka.com/mangalore/beluvais-historic-lake-is-now-a-beautiful-swimming-pool | title=Beluvai's historic lake is now a beautiful swimming pool  | publisher=News Karnataka | accessdate=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, they were tolerant towards followers of other religions and other [[Hindu]] denominations. 
The Keladi Nayakas invited Kazi Mahmoud who was a grandson of chief kazi of Adil Shahi kingdom of Bijapur to settle in [[Bhatkal]]. The revenue of Tenginagundi village was given to Kazi Mahmoud. The kazi family of Bhatkal is popularly known as Temunday Family due the ownership of lands in Tenginagundi. Many [[Nawayath]] Muslims were appointed in the administrative positions. The families of these nobles [[Nawayath]] still use their surnames as [[Ikkeri]] and are mainly settled in and around [[Bhatkal]]. The Golden Kalasa on the dome of [[Bhatkal]] Jamia Masjid popularly known as 'Chinnada Palli' meaning 'Golden Mosque' is believed to be a generous gift from Keladi rulers.

{{Thelema}}
Within the system of [[Thelema]], the '''Night of Pan''', or N.O.X., is a mystical state that represents the stage of [[ego-death]] in the process of spiritual attainment.

The playful and lecherous [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] is the [[Greek god]] of nature, lust, and the masculine generative power. The Greek word ''Pan'' also translates as ''All'', and so he is “a symbol of the Universal, a personification of Nature; both Pangenetor, "all-begetter," and Panphage, "all-devourer" (Sabazius, 1995). Therefore, Pan is both the giver and the taker of life, and his Night is that time of symbolic death where the adept experiences unification with the All through the ecstatic destruction of the ego-self. In a more general sense, it is the state where one transcends all limitations and experiences oneness with the universe.

==The City of the Pyramids==

In the [[A∴A∴]] system of attainment, after the adept has achieved the Knowledge and Conversation with his [[Holy Guardian Angel]], he then must cross the great [[Abyss (Thelema)|Abyss]], where he meets [[Choronzon]], who will tempt him to hold on to his subjective self and become trapped in his realm of illusion. To escape the Abyss, the adept gives up his deepest sense of earthly identity, in the symbolic gesture of pouring out his blood into the Cup of [[Babalon]]. The adept then becomes as a Babe in the Womb of [[Babalon]]—impregnated by Pan—and his lifeless Self becomes as a pile of dust, taking rest in the [[City of the Pyramids]], which lies under the Night of Pan. This is why it is called Night—it represents the lightless Womb, and also the time before the dawning of the new Sun (or rather, the new Self). He then waits in this sublime state until he is ready to move on to the next stage, and become “born” again from the Great Mother of Babalon, begotten by Pan.

==In writings by Crowley==

[[Aleister Crowley]] identifies this process as one of [[Love]]. He explains in ''Little Essays Towards Truth:''

:''The truly magical operations of Love are therefore the Trances, more especially those of Understanding; as will readily have been appreciated by those who have made a careful [[Qabalah|Qabalistic]] study of the nature of [[Binah (Kabbalah)|Binah]]. For she is omniform as Love and as Death, the Great Sea whence all Life springs, and whose black womb reabsorbs all. She thus resumes in herself the duplex process of the Formula of Love under Will; for is not Pan the All-Begetter in the heart of the Groves at high noon, and is not Her "hair the trees of Eternity" the filaments of All-Devouring Godhead "under the Night of Pan?"''

It is also described in the mystical text ''Liber VII:''

:''Ascend in the flame of the pyre, O my soul! Thy God is like the cold emptiness of the utmost heaven, into which thou radiatest thy little light.''
:''When Thou shall know me, O empty God, my flame shall utterly expire in Thy great N. O. X.''
:—Liber Liberi vel Lapdis Lazuli, I:39-40

Finally, Crowley writes of the Night of Pan in his ''[[The Book of Lies (Crowley)|The Book of Lies]]'', in the chapter "Sabbath of the Goat":

::O! the heart of N.O.X. the Night of Pan.
::PAN: Duality: Energy: Death.
::Death: Begetting: the supporters of O!
::To beget is to die; to die is to beget.
::Cast the Seed into the Field of Night.
::Life and Death are two names of A.
::Kill thyself.
::Neither of these alone is enough.

In his commentary on this writing, Crowley explains:

:''It is explained that this triad lives in Night, the Night of Pan, which is mystically called N.O.X., and this O is identified with the O in this word. N is the [[Tarot]] symbol, Death; and the X or Cross is the sign of the [[Phallus]]. NOX adds to 210, which symbolizes the reduction of duality to unity, and thence to negativity, and is thus a [[hieroglyph]] of the [[Great Work]].''

:''The word Pan is then explained, {Pi}, the letter of Mars, is a hieroglyph of two pillars, and therefore suggest duality; A, by its shape, is the pentagram, energy, and N, by its Tarot attribution, is death. NOX is then further explained, and it is shown that the ultimate Trinity, O!, is supported, or fed, by the process of death and begetting, which are the laws of the universe...It is then asserted that the ultimate letter A has two names, or phases, Life and Death.''

According to a Noahide source in 2018, there are over 20,000 Noahides, and the country with the greatest number is the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref name="Ilany"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ilany|first=Ofri|title=The Messianic Zionist Religion Whose Believers Worship Judaism (But Can't Practice It)|work=[[Haaretz]]|date=12 September 2018|url=https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/.premium-the-messianic-zionist-religion-that-wants-to-recruit-7-billion-members-1.6455144|accessdate=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Seven Laws of Noah==
{{main|Seven Laws of Noah}}
The seven laws listed by the [[Mishnah]] in Sanhedrin 56a are:
to have laws and courts for the society, and to refrain from blasphemy, idolatry, a set of six forbidden sexual relationships, murder, theft, and eating flesh that was removed from a living animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.halakhah.com/sanhedrin/sanhedrin_56.html|title=Babylonian Talmud: Sanhedrin 56|author=|date=|website=www.halakhah.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern Noahidism==
There are two different concepts of Noahidism in Judaism: 
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The ''B'nei Noah'' movement whose members observe the Seven Commandments or Laws&lt;ref&gt;[http://noahideworldcenter.org/wp_en/7-commandments Seven Commandments]&lt;/ref&gt; only and hold that the remaining commandments do not apply to them. This is the view of [[Chabad-Lubavitch]] and a few other movements. This means that Noahides may not observe the Sabbath, study Torah (except for the Seven Laws), etc. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The ''B'nei Noah'' movement whose members hold that they can adhere completely to Judaism in order to learn from the Jews and together promote{{clarify|date=October 2018}} the world but without becoming a part of the Jewish people (i.e. without performing a giyur). After ''B'nei Noah'' accept the obligatory seven commandments, they can, if they so desire, carry out the rest of the Jewish commandments, including studying the Torah, observing the Sabbath, celebrating Jewish holidays, etc. This view is held, for example, by [[Yoel Schwartz| Ravi Yoel Schwartz]] and [[Oury Amos Cherki| Rav Uri Scherki]].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

According to the first approach, the answer to the question "Can a non-Jew observe the Sabbath and study the Torah?" is negative, and according to the second one, it is affirmative.

In one place in his books, Maimonides writes "The ''goy'' must not observe the Sabbath and study the Torah," while in another place he says "If a Noahide wants to observe additional commandments besides the seven basic ones of ''B'nei Noah'', he receives a reward from Heaven, and we (the Jews) must support him in this." Many people quote the first of his statements, not knowing about the existence of the second one. [[Oury Amos Cherki| Rav Uri Scherki]] (and the rabbinical council of the [http://noahideworldcenter.org/wp_en Brit Olam organization]) explain this contradiction in Maimonides by saying that the ''goy'' and ''B'nei Noah'' are different halakhic concepts. A ''goy'' is a gentile who has not yet accepted the commandments of ''B'nei Noah''. However, if he has already accepted Seven Laws, he ceases to be a ''goy'' and became a ''B'nei Noah'', and as such can follow additional commandments, including keeping the Sabbath and teaching the Torah.&lt;ref&gt;[http://noahideworldcenter.org/wp_en/the-meaning-of-the-chosen-people-and-what-is-a-goy The meaning of the chosen people and what is a goy]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi [[Meir Kahane]] organized one of the first Noahide conferences in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Halevi|first=Ezra|title=Sanhedrin Recognizes Council to Teach Humanity ´Laws of Noah|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/96347#.Vb_xDfm6evs|newspaper=Arutz 7 News|date=January 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, Kahane was the keynote speaker at the First International Conference of the Descendants of Noah in [[Fort Worth, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kahane|first1=Meir|title=Rabbi Meir Kahane Speaks at the First International Conference of the Descendants of Noah|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dO3SnckL7A|website=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chabad-Lubavitch]] movement has been the most active in Noahide outreach, believing that there is spiritual and societal value for non-Jews in at least simply acknowledging the seven laws, and even more so if they accept or observe them. In 1991, they had a reference to these laws enshrined in a Congressional proclamation: Presidential Proclamation 5956,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=23514|title=Presidency|publisher=UCSB|accessdate=February 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; signed by then-President [[George H. W. Bush]]. Recalling Joint House Resolution 173, and recalling that the ethical and moral principles of all civilizations come in part from the Seven Noahide Laws, it proclaimed March 26, 1991 as "Education Day, U.S.A."  Subsequently, Public Law 102-14 formally designated the Lubavitcher Rebbe's 90th birthday as "Education Day, U.S.A.," with Congress recalling that "without these ethical values and principles, the edifice of civilization stands in serious peril of returning to chaos," and that "society is profoundly concerned with the recent weakening of these principles, that has resulted in crises that beleaguer and threaten the fabric of civilized society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c102:H.J.RES.104.ENR:|title=Thomas|publisher=LoC|accessdate=February 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April, 2006, the spiritual leader of the [[Druze]] community in Israel, Sheikh [[Mowafak Tarif]], met with a representative of Chabad-Lubavitch to sign a declaration calling on all non-Jews in Israel to observe the Noahide Laws as laid down in the Bible and expounded upon in Jewish tradition.  The mayor of the Galilean city of [[Shefa-'Amr]] (Shfaram) — where Muslim, Christian and Druze communities live side-by-side — also signed the document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|title= Druze Religious Leader Commits to Noachide "Seven Laws" 
|date= 2004-01-18 |access-date= 2014-01-18
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March, 2007, Chabad-Lubavitch gathered ambassadors from six countries to take part in a gathering to declare, in the name of the states they represent, their support of the universal teachings of Noahide Laws. They represented Poland, Latvia, Mexico, Panama, Ghana, and Japan. They were part of a special program organized by Harav Boaz Kali.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chabadjapan.org/blog_e/?p=3 Ambassadors Sign 7 Mitzvos Declaration], chabadjapan.org; accessed February 25, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April, [[Abu Gosh]] mayor Salim Jaber accepted the seven Noahide laws as part of a mass rally by Chabad at the [[Bloomfield Stadium]] in Tel Aviv. In May, the newly elected president of France, [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], met with a Chabad-Lubavitch rabbi, Dovid Zaoui, who presented him with literature on the universal teachings of the Noahide Laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chabad.info/index.php?url=article_en&amp;id=8980 French President Sarkozy Discusses Sheva Mitzvos], chabad.info; accessed February 25, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 Chief Rabbi [[Yitzhak Yosef]] taught that Jewish law requires that the only non-Jews allowed to live in Israel are Noahides: "“According to Jewish law, it’s forbidden for a non-Jew to live in the Land of Israel – unless he has accepted the seven Noahide laws.” The Anti-Defamation League issued a strong denunciation of Yosef’s comments, and called on him to retract them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Non-Jews-are-forbidden-by-Jewish-law-to-live-in-Israel-chief-rabbi-says-449395 "Non-Jews in Israel must keep Noahide laws, chief rabbi says"], ''The Jerusalem Post'', March 28, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

{{For|the publication ''Oriens christianus in quatuor patriarchatus digestus''|Michel Le Quien}}
'''''Oriens Christianus''''' is an [[academic journal]] established in 1901 by [[Otto Harrassowitz]] with [[Asian studies|Asian]] and [[oriental studies]] as the major focus.&lt;ref&gt;The original subtitle was "Römische Halbjahr Hefte für die Kunde of christlichen Easts ', which later became simply" Hefte für die Kunde of christlichen Easts'.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;It was founded January 25, 1876 to mark the hundredth anniversary of the birth of writer and Catholic historian Joseph Görres, in his hometown. There has been a Görres Institute in [[Rome]] since 1887.&lt;/ref&gt;It was edited by [[Carl Anton Baumstark|Anton Baumstark]] (1872-1948).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Reviews | author = S. P. Brock | journal = [[The Journal of Theological Studies]] | year = 1973 | volume = XXIV | issue = 1 | pages =237–238 | doi = 10.1093/jts/XXIV.1.237 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The current [[editors-in-chief]] are Hubert Kaufhold ([[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]]) and Manfred Kropp ([[University of Mainz]]).


Its domain is the [[Christian East]] excluding [[Greek Orthodox|Greek]] and Slavic [[Christendom]] (covered by other reviews), that is to say the [[Middle East]] from [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Armenia]] to [[Ethiopia]], Asian Christian communities and to [[India]] and [[China]]. According to the founder of the program, all elements of the spiritual and material culture of the Christian communities of the East can be addressed. The journal publishes background articles, minutes of reading, but also source-texts in the various languages of Eastern Christendom. Articles can be written in different languages.

The review was led until 1941 (with brief interruptions) by its founder Carl Anton Baumstark, who has published 140 feature articles and 145 book reviews accounts.

'''Petiese''' (alt. '''Peteese''', '''Pediese''') was the name of a number of high ancient Egyptian officials who served the pharaohs during the seventh and sixth centuries BCE. Their family history is known from a petition (pRylands 9) which the priest Petiese (referred to below as Petiese III) wrote during the reign of [[Darius I of Persia]], although some have claimed that, rather than a real petition, this is a [[Ancient Egyptian literature|work of literature]] or at best a draft for a petition.

==The Petition of Petiese==
Petiese I, son of Ireturu, administered [[Upper Egypt]] jointly with his cousin Petiese, son of Ankhshesheq, who held the position of Ships Master. In 651 BCE he had his priestly offices confirmed by [[Psamtik I]], above all that of prophet of [[Amun]] of [[Al-Hibah|Teudjoi]]. After he had resigned from his powerful office of administrator of Upper Egypt, the priests of Teudjoi decided in 621 to wrest his priestly offices, which were well paid, from him and killed two of his grandsons. Pediese received police protection. He restored the fortunes of the temple at Teudjoi. Pediese's rights were inscribed on a stela. He signed over his prophet's portion to his son Wedjasematawi I.

In 591, Petiese II, son of Wedjasematawi I, accompanied [[Psamtik II]] on a campaign to Syria. While he was away, the priests of Teudjoi bribed an official and Petiese on his return lost his case against the priests in court.

After his death, his son Wedjasematawi II had to flee from Teudjoi as the priests tried to force him to sign over his rights to them. They destroyed his house in his absence, but had to pay a small compensation when Petiese III, the son of Wedjasematawi II, brought an action against them.

If the petition of Petiese III is to be believed there was little justice in the Egypt of his time and only bribery brought results.

'''RUN Ministries''' is a live rescue and church planting effort&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.runministries.org/ RUN Ministries homepage]&lt;/ref&gt; founded in 1990 by Eric Watt and currently operates in Iraq, Nepal, and Central Asia.  Specifically in Iraq, RUN rescues women who have been sold into sexual slavery, often purchasing their liberation.  It is a registered 501(c)3 tax-deductible US charity, presenting itself as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
An interdenominational mission, RUN subscribes to the Lausanne Covenant and cooperates with Christians around the world to help fulfill the Great Commission. For the past decade God has enabled RUN to equip thousands of first generation Christian leaders from within the [[10/40 Window]], providing evangelistic media tools, a culturally sensitive discipleship model and practical skills for their ministries to become self-sustaining.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

RUN helps build long-term sustainable enterprises (cottage crafts){{citation needed|date=November 2014}} that financially under-gird and stabilize the work being done among previously unreached or under-reached peoples in order "to bring hope and dignity to those whose lives have been ravaged by spiritual darkness, governmental and religious oppression, and economic poverty."  It further evangelizes these liberated persons and hopes to organize them into nondenominational (underground) Christian churches.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Through a process of selection, training, mentoring and capitalization, RUN chooses leaders, helps them design their business plans and sources funding so that work can begin. As the business grows RUN provides ongoing mentoring to insure their kingdom fruitfulness and financial success.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The parent nonprofit has a partner relationship with Grassroots Action, Inc.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hoovers.com/company-information/cs/company-profile.grassroots_action_inc.f1d647dc39661667.html Dun &amp; Bradstreet/Hoovers information profile for Grassroots Action, Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt; a privately held for-profit Internet services company specializing in citizen-action services, including petitions, activism services, and resource development.

The ''' Archdiocese of Karachi''', originally known as the [[Diocese]] of [[Karachi]], was erected on 20 May 1948 under the Metropolitan [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bombay|Archdiocese of Bombay]], [[India]]. It was elevated as the Archdiocese of Karachi on 15 July 1950. The seat of the Archdiocese is [[Saint Patrick's Cathedral, Karachi|St. Patrick's Cathedral]]. The [[Christ the King Seminary]], the major [[seminary]] of the country, is located in the Archdiocese.

The Archdiocese has contributed to the welfare of the country through its  [[:Category:Roman Catholic schools in Pakistan|schools]], [[holy Family Hospital, Karachi|hospitals]], orphanages and other institutions. In 1998, the Archdiocese of Karachi owned 17 English- and 46 Urdu-medium schools for some 40,000 students with about 1,700 teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = UCANews.com March 3, 1998| url= http://www.ucanews.com/1998/03/03/sindh-chief-justice-says-government-should-return-nationalized-schools/?key=st.+patrick's+technical+school+karachi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Archdiocese has also produced a religious order for women known as the [[Franciscan Missionaries of Christ the King]] (FMCK) that founded schools, orphanages, [[Darul Sukun|homes for the aged and disabled]] and hospitals throughout the country and in India and Sri Lanka.

The Archdiocese publishes an Urdu-language weekly newspaper [[Agahi]] (knowledge) and an English-language weekly newspaper The [[Christian Voice, Karachi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = AsiaNews.it 21 October2006 | url=http://www.asianews.it/index.php?l=en&amp;art=7545}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Archdiocese celebrated its Golden Jubilee on 20 May 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = KARACHI ARCHDIOCESE GOLDEN JUBILEE | url=http://www.ucanews.com/1998/12/01/parishbased-renewal-targeted-for-karachi-archdiocese-golden-jubilee/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the archdiocese had 18 parishes, 15 in the city of Karachi and one each in mission stations at Kotri, Khuzdar and Larkana.&lt;ref&gt;The Christian Voice, Karachi, 27 August 2000&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the Archdiocese had 145 thousand faithful in a population of  15 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = AsiaNews.it 29 October 2009 | url= http://www.asianews.it/index.php?l=en&amp;art=1492}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Encouraged by [[Pope Benedict XVI]]'s message for the World Day of Social Communications, wherein he affirms that "digital technologies are a gift for humanity that can be useful for spreading solidarity and understanding among people and populations",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Catholic Word Getting Out In Pakistan |url = http://www.zenit.org/article-26286?l=english |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090626143702/http://zenit.org/article-26286?l=english |archivedate = 26 June 2009 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Archdiocese launched a web-based television network Good News TV in February 2009.

On December 11, 2009 the Archdiocese  lost its longest serving priest when Father D'Arcy D'Souza, 97, died in [[Holy Family Hospital, Karachi|Holy Family Hospital]]. Fr.

===Saint Francis of Assisi Parish, Karachi===
The Saint Francis of Assisi Parish, located on Siddiq Wahab Road in the [[Haji Camp, Karachi|Old Haji Camp]] area, is a part of the Archdiocese.

The first parish priest, from July 1941 – 1944, was Fr. [[Liberius Pieterse]]. He later became known for his translation of the Bible into [[Urdu]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://casperboelen.nl/Documenten/04PietersedeMeijer/InMemCarelText.html In memoriam Rev. Fr. Liberius Pieterse O.F.M., 12/2/1905 – 24/9/1973], NEWSLETTER O.F.M. a monthly publication of the Franciscan Custody of St. John the Baptist, Pakistan, [[Portiuncula Friary]], November 1973&lt;/ref&gt; For nearly 80 years, parish nuns have maintained a medical clinic and school for poor Pakistanis.

During the mid 1950s Fr. [[Simeon Anthony Pereira]] was appointed Parish Priest of the parish. Fr. Simeon went on to become the Archbishop of Karachi &lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.dawn.com/2006/08/24/local14.htm Dawn August 24, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

The parish also has a school attached to it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.dawn.com/2002/07/14/local10.htm Dawn, July 14, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

St. Francis was the first parish to cater to the many people migrating from Punjab province to the city. The Jesuits and the  [[Franciscan Missionaries of Christ the King]] nuns started the migrant mission which still continues as Catholics pour in from the provinces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucanews.com/2011/11/07/migrant-catholics-struggle-for-acceptance/ UCANews November 7, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Attack ====

On October 12, 2012, the parish was attacked by a mob of 600 Islamic radicals that destroyed property in the yard, but failed to break down the front door.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fides.org/en/news/32451-ASIA_PAKISTAN_The_church_of_San_Francesco_attacked_in_Karachi_the_Franciscans_in_fear#.VjJiDFLhGHs The church of San Francesco attacked in Karachi: the Franciscans in fear], Agenzia Fides, October 17, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Saleem Khurshid Khokhar, a member of the [[Sindh]] Provincial Assembly, visited shortly after the attack and condemned violence against religious minorities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pakistanchristianpost.com/headlinenewsd.php?hnewsid=3856 Muslim mob vandalize St. Francis Church Karachi], Pakistan Christian Post&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scientology''' has operated in '''Belgium''' since 1972, but the organization has encountered difficulties there in recent years.

==Status of Scientology in Belgium==
[[Belgium]] only officially recognizes six religions: [[Roman Catholicism]], [[Protestantism]], [[Anglicanism]], the [[Orthodox Church]], [[Judaism]] and [[Islam]] (recently also [[Buddhism]]) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brusselsjournal.com/node/2404|title=Belgium Clamps Down on Scientology Church - The Brussels Journal|publisher=[[The Brussels Journal]]|accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has denied Scientology's request to be included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Planchar | first = Roland | title = Un impôt et deux religions de plus? | journal =  La Libre Belgique | date = July 2005| url = http://www.lalibre.be/article.phtml?id=10&amp;subid=90&amp;art_id=231058 | accessdate = 2006-07-23|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientology opened an international office in 2003 near the European Union headquarters to lobby for recognition as an official religious group.&lt;ref name=SFCC /&gt;

==2007 trial proposal==

The Belgian government denied Scientology the status of religion in 1997, and began investigating its practices and finances after ex-Scientologists said they had been subjected to intimidation and extortion. Concluding the ten-year investigation, on September 4, 2007, a Belgian prosecutor recommended that 12 persons associated with Scientology and two legal entities – the Belgian Church of Scientology and Scientology's Office of Human Rights – should be prosecuted on counts of extortion, fraud, organized crime, obstruction of medical practice, illegal medical practice, invasion of privacy, conspiracy and commercial infractions like abusive contractual clauses.&lt;ref name=foxbel&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,295693,00.html | work=Fox News | title=Church of Scientology Faces Criminal Charges in Belgium | date=2007-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Planchar&gt;{{cite web | first = Roland | last = Planchar | title = La Scientologie plus près de son procès | url = http://www.lalibre.be/article.phtml?id=10&amp;subid=90&amp;art_id=368037 | publisher = La Libre Belgique | date = 2007-09-04 | accessdate = 2007-09-04|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; An administrative court would decide if the case would go ahead and charges would be pressed.&lt;ref name=foxbel /&gt;&lt;ref name=Planchar /&gt; The court's decision was expected to be announced within a few months.&lt;ref name=Planchar /&gt;

===U.S. State Department response===

Belgium and other European countries have been criticized by the [[U.S. State Department]] for ruling that Scientology was a cult or sect and enacting restrictive laws against it.&lt;ref name=SFCC&gt;Constant Brand, [http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2007/09/04/scientology_faces_criminal_charges/ "Scientology Faces Criminal Charges"], Associated Press/''[[Boston Globe]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the proposed trial, the U.S. State Department said that if Belgian authorities "have evidence that individuals violated Belgian law, they should take appropriate legal steps consistent with Belgium’s international obligations to protect freedom of thought, conscience and religion"; however, the State Department would "oppose any effort to stigmatize an entire group based solely upon religious beliefs and would be concerned over infringement of any individual’s rights because of religious affiliation."&lt;ref name=SFCC /&gt;&lt;ref name=USSDPB&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2007/sep/91709.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306123912/http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2007/sep/91709.htm|title=Belgium: Prosecutor Recommends Legal Action Against Scientology|archivedate=6 March 2008|publisher=[[United States Department of State]]|accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Church of Scientology response===
The [[Associated Press]] reported an official statement released by the Church of Scientology on September 4, 2007:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"For the last 10 years, the prosecutor has been using the media, trying to damage the reputation of the Church of Scientology and not being able to put a case in court," Scientology said. "As a consequence, this created a climate of intolerance and discrimination" in Belgium.&lt;ref name=SFCC /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Church added that the prosecutor's recommendations suggested Scientology was guilty even before a court could hear the charges, making it "difficult for the Church of Scientology to recover and properly defend (itself) before the court."&lt;ref name=SFCC /&gt;

==2015 trial==
In October 2015 a criminal trial started against twelve leaders of Scientology in Belgium. Charges against them were bribery, extortion, fraud, violation of the privacy and unlicensed practicing of medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hln.be/hln/nl/957/Binnenland/article/detail/2502877/2015/10/26/Scientology-proces-na-18-jaar-eindelijk-van-start-in-Brussel.dhtml|title=Scientology-proces na 18 jaar eindelijk van start in Brussel|work=[[Het Laatste Nieuws]]|accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquittal===

On March 2016, the Church of Scientology was acquitted of all charges, and demands to close its Belgian branch and European headquarters were dismissed. The presiding judge, Yves Regimont, cited prejudice in the investigators and said that the church had been “unfairly hounded for years by Belgian authorities,” according to a report by ABC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-03-12/belgium-court-acquits-scientology-of-charges/7241800|title=Belgium court acquits Scientology of charges|author=|date=12 March 2016|website=abc.net.au|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; “The entire proceedings are declared inadmissible for a serious and irremediable breach of the right to a fair trial. The defendants were prosecuted primarily because they were Scientologists,” the judge said.&lt;ref&gt;https://au.news.yahoo.com/world/a/31078399/belgian-court-throws-out-case-against-scientology-branch/&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 2016, the decision become “definitive” due to the Belgian prosecutors’ failure to appeal, said Pascal Vanderveeren, the lawyer for the church in Belgium, to a press conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/World/News/case-against-belgian-scientologists-dropped-20160426|title=Case against Belgian Scientologists dropped|author=|date=|website=news24.com|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; “It was important to point out that the ruling for a week is final. The prosecution had thirty days to appeal and also had the prosecutor ten days following notification (the ruling) to appeal. We note that none of them objected to this statement," said Vanderveeren. Eric Roux, Church of Scientology Belgium spokesman stated, “This is a victory for the freedom of religion.” The Church of Scientology also announced that they are taking into consideration attempting to acquire compensation from the Belgian State for damages incurred. The final ruling effectively ends the 18-year-old legal proceedings against the church in Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws/binnenland/1.2640251|title=Strafzaak Scientology definitief gesloten|author=|date=|website=deredactie.be|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 2016, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe published a presentation by the Church of Scientology regarding the acquittal. It stated that after an eighteen-year investigation, the evidence was closely scrutinized and evaluated. They cited that the prosecutor had been “prejudiced” against the church and had a “total lack of objectivity.” According to the document, the presumption of guilt of the defendants just by simply associating with Scientology is an “egregious violation of defendants’ rights.” Charges included fraud, extortion, running a criminal enterprise, violating privacy and the illegal practice of medicine. The charges were found “contrary and contradictory” and lacked evidence. The church declared in the document that the acquittal was a “landmark decision protecting religious freedom and freedom of conscience.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osce.org/odihr/268701|title=Church of Scientology submission - OSCE|author=|date=|website=www.osce.org|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15431">The '''Serenity Prayer''' is the common name for a [[prayer]] written by the American theologian [[Reinhold Niebuhr]]&lt;ref name=FRS&gt;{{cite news| first= Fred R. | last= Shapiro| url= http://chronicle.com/article/Who-Wrote-the-Serenity-Prayer-/146159/ |title= Who Wrote the Serenity Prayer?| work= The Chronicle Review| date= April 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| editor-first= Justin | editor-last= Kaplan| work= [[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]| page= 735 |edition=  17th| year= 2002}} (attributing the prayer to Niebuhr in 1943)&lt;/ref&gt; (1892–1971).  The best-known form is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,
Courage to change the things I can,
And wisdom to know the difference.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Niebuhr, who first wrote the prayer for a sermon at [[Heath Center Historic District|Heath Evangelical Union Church]] in [[Heath, Massachusetts|Heath]], [[Massachusetts]],&lt;ref name=Zaleski/&gt; used it widely in sermons as early as 1934&lt;ref name=FRS/&gt; and first published it in 1951 in a magazine column.&lt;ref name=FRS/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shapiro&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.yalealumnimagazine.com/articles/2143 |first= Fred R. |last= Shapiro| title= Who Wrote the Serenity Prayer| work= Yale Alumni Magazine| date= July–August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prayer spread through Niebuhr's sermons and church groups in the 1930s and 1940s and was adopted and popularized by [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] and other [[twelve-step program]]s.

==Versions==
The prayer has appeared in many versions. [[Reinhold Niebuhr]]'s versions of the prayer were always printed as a single prose sentence; printings that set out the prayer as three lines of verse modify the author's original version. The most well-known form is a late version, as it includes a reference to [[Divine grace|grace]] not found before 1951:&lt;ref name=FRS/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;God, give me grace to accept with serenity
the things that cannot be changed,
Courage to change the things
which should be changed,
and the Wisdom to distinguish
the one from the other.

Living one day at a time,
Enjoying one moment at a time,
Accepting hardship as a pathway to peace,
Taking, as Jesus did,
This sinful world as it is,
Not as I would have it,
Trusting that You will make all things right,
If I surrender to Your will,
So that I may be reasonably happy in this life,
And supremely happy with You forever in the next.

Amen.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A version (apparently quoted from memory) appeared in the "Queries and Answers" column in ''The New York Times Book Review'', July 2, 1950, p.&amp;nbsp;23, asking for the author of the quotation. A reply in the same column in the issue for August 13, 1950, p.&amp;nbsp;19, attributed the prayer to Niebuhr, quoting it as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;O God and Heavenly Father,
Grant to us the serenity of mind to accept that which cannot be changed; courage to change that which can be changed, and wisdom to know the one from the other, through Jesus Christ our Lord, Amen.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:UNKNOWN MEDALLION - POSSIBLY AADAC or NA b - Flickr - woody1778a.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|Serenity prayer on a medallion]]
Some [[twelve-step program|twelve-step recovery programs]] use a slightly different version:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,
Courage to change the things I can,
and the Wisdom to know the difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Littleton|first1=Jeanett Gardner|last2=Bell|first2=James Stuart|title=Living the Serenity Prayer: True Stories of Acceptance, Courage, and Wisdom|date=2008|publisher=Adams Media|location=Avon, Massachusetts|isbn=978-1-59869-116-0|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Early history==
The earliest recorded reference to the prayer is a diary entry from 1932 by Winnifred Crane Wygal, a pupil and collaborator of [[Reinhold Niebuhr]], quoting the prayer and attributing it to Niebuhr.&lt;ref name=FRS/&gt; Several versions of the prayer then appeared in newspaper articles in the early 1930s written by, or reporting on talks given by, Wygal.&lt;ref name=FRS/&gt; In 1940, Wygal included the following form of the prayer in a book on worship, attributing it to Niebuhr:&lt;ref&gt;Wygel, ''We Plan Our Own Worship Services: Business girls practice the act and the art of group worship'', New York, The Woman's Press: 1940&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;O God, give us the serenity to accept what cannot be changed, the courage to change what can be changed, and the wisdom to know the one from the other.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wygal was a longtime [[YWCA]] official and all early recorded usages were from women involved in volunteer or educational activities connected to the YWCA.&lt;ref name=FRS/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shapiro /&gt;{{rp|3}}

The earliest printed reference, in 1936, mentions that during a speech, a Miss Mildred Pinkerton "quotes the prayer," as if to indicate it was already in a circulation known to the reporter, or that Pinkerton relayed it as a quote, without mentioning its authorship. A 1937 Christian student publication attributed the prayer to Niebuhr in the following form, which matches the other earliest published forms in requesting "courage to change" before petitioning for serenity:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Father, give us courage to change what must be altered, serenity to accept what cannot be helped, and the insight to know the one from the other.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Various other authors also cited Niebuhr as the source of the prayer from 1937 on.&lt;ref name=FRS/&gt; The [[Federal Council of Churches]] (NCC) included the prayer in a book for army chaplains and servicemen in 1944 and the [[USO]] circulated the prayer (with Niebuhr's permission) to soldiers on printed cards during [[World War Two]].&lt;ref name=Zaleski&gt;{{cite book| first1= Philip |last1= Zaleski |first2= Carol |last2= Zaleski| title= Prayer: A History| publisher= Houghton Mifflin| year= 2005| isbn= 9780618152889| page= 127}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ERN/&gt; In 1950, in response to questions about the already quite widely known prayer's provenance, Niebuhr wrote that the prayer "may have been spooking around for years, even centuries, but I don't think so. I honestly do believe that I wrote it myself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.aagrapevine.org/da/article.php?id=64923&amp;tb=3cT1uaWVidWhyJmhkcnNlYXJjaC54PTAmaGRyc2VhcmNoLnk9MCZoZHJzZWFyY2g9U2VhcmNo |title= The Serenity Prayer| work= The Grapevine, The International Journal of Alcoholics Anonymous| date= January 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AAHistory&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.aahistory.com/prayer.html |title= The Origin of our Serenity Prayer| work= AAHistory.com| access-date= July 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He confirmed this in 1967.&lt;ref name=ERN&gt;{{cite book| title= The Essential Reinhold Niebuhr: Selected Essays and Addresses| first= Reinhold | last= Niebuhr| editor-first= Robert McAfee | editor-last= Brown| page= 251| publisher= Yale University Press| edition=  New | date= September 10, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; His daughter, Elisabeth Sifton, thought that Niebuhr had first written it in 1943,&lt;ref name= Sifton&gt;{{cite book| title= The Serenity Prayer: Faith and Politics in Times of Peace and War| first= Elisabeth | last= Sifton| publisher= [[W. W.

The Serenity Prayer will be listed under Niebuhr’s name in the next edition of the ''Yale Book of Quotations'', whose author Fred R. Shapiro had first raised doubts about, but was later instrumental in confirming Niebuhr's authorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url= http://www.yalealumnimagazine.com/articles/2709 |first= Fred R. |last= Shapiro| title= You Can Quote Them| work= Yale Alumni Magazine| date= January–February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Precursors==
Numerous statements of more or less similar sentiments by other authors have been identified and it is likely that more will be found. The prayer has also been falsely attributed to a variety of other authors.

===Genuine precursors===
[[Epictetus]] wrote: "Make the best use of what is in your power, and take the rest as it happens. Some things are up to us [eph' hêmin] and some things are not up to us. Our opinions are up to us, and our impulses, desires, aversions&amp;mdash;in short, whatever is our own doing. Our bodies are not up to us, nor are our possessions, our reputations, or our public offices, or, that is, whatever is not our own doing."&lt;ref&gt;Epictetus (1983), [[Enchiridion of Epictetus|Handbook]]. Trans. Nicholas White. Indianapolis: Hackett. Section 1.1&lt;/ref&gt;

The 8th-century [[India]]n [[Buddhist]] scholar [[Shantideva]] of the ancient [[Nalanda|Nalanda University]] suggested:&lt;ref&gt;Shantideva, Padmakara Translation Group, "The Way of the Bodhisattva", p. 130, Ch. 6, verse 10, Shambhala Publications, (October 14, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;If there's a remedy when trouble strikes,
What reason is there for dejection?
And if there is no help for it,
What use is there in being glum?&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 11th-century Jewish philosopher [[Solomon ibn Gabirol]] wrote:&lt;ref&gt;'Choice of Pearls' (Chapter 17 'Consciousness' 2nd verse)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;And they said: At the head of all understanding – is realizing what is and what cannot be, and the consoling of what is not in our power to change.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The philosopher [[William Warren Bartley|W.W. Bartley]] juxtaposes without comment Niebuhr's prayer with a [[Mother Goose]] rhyme (1695) expressing a similar sentiment:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| authorlink= William Warren Bartley| first= W. W. |last= Bartley| title= The Retreat to Commitment| page= 35| publisher= Open Court Publishing Company| date= April 1990| edition=  New; first 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;For every ailment under the sun
There is a remedy, or there is none;
If there be one, try to find it;
If there be none, never mind it.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Friedrich Schiller]] advocated the first part in 1801: "Blessed is he, who has learned to bear what he cannot change, and to give up with dignity, what he cannot save."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| quote= Wohl dem Menschen, wenn er gelernt hat, zu ertragen, was er nicht ändern kann, und preiszugeben mit Würde, was er nicht retten kann.| first= Friedrich | last= Schiller| title= Über das Erhabene| language= de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spurious attributions===
The prayer has been variously attributed (without evidence) to [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Cicero]], [[Augustine]], [[Boethius]], [[Marcus Aurelius]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first1= Philip |last1= Zaleski |first2= Carol |last2= Zaleski| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=SDHsE_Efy0EC&amp;dq |title= Prayer: A History| pages= 126–127| publisher= [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]]| year= 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francis of Assisi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.almapress.unibo.it/dubcek/intro/intro.htm |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20040913100104/http://www.almapress.unibo.it/dubcek/intro/intro.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2004-09-13 |title=Alexander Dubcek – Introduzione |website= Almapress.unibo.it| language= it |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source| date= January 2016}} and [[Thomas More]]{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}, among others.

[[:de:Theodor Wilhelm|Theodor Wilhelm]], a professor of education at the [[University of Kiel]], published a German version of the prayer under the pseudonym "Friedrich Oetinger".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= Friedrich |last= Oetinger| title= Wendepunkt der poltitischen Erziehung| year= 1951| url= http://www.substanceabusecounselor.us/addiction/the-full-serenity-prayer-its-meaning/ |chapter= The Full Serenity Prayer &amp; Its Meaning| via= SubstanceAbuseCounselor.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilhelm's [[plagiarism|plagiarized]] version of the prayer became popular in [[West Germany]], where it was widely but falsely attributed to the 18th-century philosopher [[Friedrich Christoph Oetinger]].&lt;ref name= Sifton /&gt;{{rp|343}}

==Use by twelve-step recovery programs==
The prayer became more widely known after being brought to the attention of [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] in 1941 by an early member,&lt;ref&gt;"Stalking the Wild Serenity Prayer", Appendix B in: {{cite book |last=Wing |first=Nell |title=Grateful to Have Been There: My 42 Years with Bill and Lois, and the Evolution of Alcoholics Anonymous |page=167 |isbn=1-56838-064-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; who came upon it in a caption in a "routine [[New York Herald Tribune]] obituary".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=August-September 1992|title=The Elusive Origins of the Serenity Prayer|url=|journal=BOX 459|volume=38, no. 4|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; AA's [[William Griffith Wilson|co-founder]] and staff liked the prayer and had it printed in modified form and handed around. It has been part of [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] ever since, and has also been used in other [[twelve-step program]]s. "Never had we seen so much A.A. in so few words," noted founder [[Bill W.|Bill Wilson]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ''Grapevine, The International Journal of Alcoholics Anonymous'', identified Niebuhr as the author (January 1950, pp.&amp;nbsp;6–7), and the AA web site continues to identify Niebuhr as the author.&lt;ref name=AAHistory/&gt;

The original text for this adapted prayer was:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Father, give us courage to change what must be altered, 
serenity to accept what cannot be helped, 
and the insight to know the one from the other.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A slightly different version of the prayer has been widely adopted by twelve-step groups:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;God grant us the serenity to accept the things we cannot change, 
the courage to change the things we can, 
and the wisdom to know the difference.&lt;ref&gt;''NA White Booklet'', Narcotics Anonymous, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

'''Shreyansanath''' was the eleventh [[Jain]] [[Tirthankara]] of the present age (Avasarpini).{{sfn|Tukol|1980|p=31}} According to Jain beliefs, he became a [[Siddha]] - a liberated soul which has destroyed all of its [[Karma in Jainism|karma]]. Shreyansanatha was born to King ''Vishnu'' and Queen ''Vishnu Devi'' at [[Simhapuri]], near [[Sarnath]] in the [[Ikshvaku dynasty]]. His birth date was the twelfth day of the Falgun Krishna month of the Indian calendar.{{sfn|Tukol|1980|p=31}}

The concept of the '''supernatural''' proposes that something cannot be explained by scientific understanding or the [[Physical law|laws of nature]]. Examples often include characteristics of or relating to entities and concepts such as [[ghost]]s, [[angel]]s, [[gods]], [[souls]] and [[spirit]]s, [[non-physical entity|non-material being]]s, or anything else considered ''beyond'' nature like [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] or [[miracle]]s.

Over time, things once thought to be supernatural such as [[lightning]], [[seasons]], and [[human senses]] have been shown to have entirely naturalistic explanations and origins. Some believe that which is considered supernatural will someday be discovered to be completely physical and natural. Those who believe only the physical world exists are called [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalists]]. Those who believe similarly often maintain skeptical attitudes and beliefs concerning supernatural concepts. Belief in the supernatural can also occur in secular contexts.&lt;ref name="Halman 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Halman|first=Loek|title=Atheism and Secularity Vol.2: Gloabal Expressions|year=2010|publisher=Praeger|isbn=9780313351839|editor=Phil Zuckerman|chapter=8. Atheism And Secularity In The Netherlands|quote="Thus, despite the fact that they claim to be convinced atheists and the majority deny the existence of a personal god, a rather large minority of the Dutch convinced atheists believe in a supernatural power!" (e.g. telepathy, reincarnation, life after death, and heaven)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The supernatural is featured in [[paranormal]], [[occultism|occult]], and [[religion|religious]] contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Pasulka |first1=Diana |last2=Kripal |first2=Jeffrey |title=Religion and the Paranormal |url=https://blog.oup.com/2014/11/religion-supernatural-paranormal/ |website=Oxford University Press blog |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, belief in the supernatural can also occur in secular contexts as well.&lt;ref name="Halman 2010"/&gt;

==Etymology==
Occurring as both an adjective and a noun, descendants of the modern English compound ''supernatural'' enters the language from two sources: By way of Middle French (''supernaturel'') and directly from the Middle French's term's ancestor, post-Classical Latin (''supernaturalis''). Post-classical Latin ''supernaturalis'' first occurs in the 6th century, composed of the Latin prefix ''super-'' and ''nātūrālis'' (see [[nature]]). The earliest known appearance of the word in the English language occurs in a Middle English translation of [[Catherine of Siena]]'s ''[[Dialogue]]'' (''orcherd of Syon'', around 1425; ''Þei haue not þanne þe supernaturel lyȝt ne þe liȝt of kunnynge, bycause þei vndirstoden it not'').&lt;ref name="OED-SUPERNATURAL"&gt;{{Cite OED |supernatural |id=194422 |access-date=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The semantic value of the term has shifted over the history of its use. Originally the term referred exclusively to Christian understandings of the world. For example, as an adjective, the term can mean 'belonging to a realm or system that transcends nature, as that of divine, magical, or ghostly beings; attributed to or thought to reveal some force beyond scientific understanding or the laws of nature; occult, paranormal' or 'more than what is natural or ordinary; unnaturally or extraordinarily great; abnormal, extraordinary'. Obsolete uses include 'of, relating to, or dealing with metaphysics'. As a noun, the term can mean 'a supernatural being', with a particularly strong history of employment in relation to entities from the [[mythologies of the indigenous peoples of the Americas]].&lt;ref name="OED-SUPERNATURAL"/&gt;

==Epistemology and metaphysics==
{{see also|Anthropology of religion}}
The [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] considerations of the existence of the supernatural can be difficult to approach as an exercise in philosophy or theology because any dependencies on its antithesis, the [[Naturalism (philosophy)|natural]], will ultimately have to be inverted or rejected.

One complicating factor is that there is disagreement about the definition of "natural" and the limits of [[metaphysical naturalism|naturalism]]. Concepts in the supernatural domain are closely related to concepts in [[religion|religious]] [[spirituality]] and [[occultism]] or [[spiritualism]].

{{quote|For sometimes we use the word ''[[nature]]'' for that ''Author of nature'' whom the [[scholasticism|schoolmen]], harshly enough, call ''[[natura naturans]]'', as when it is said that ''nature'' hath made man partly corporeal and [[Mind-body dualism|partly immaterial]]. Sometimes we mean by the ''nature'' of a thing the ''[[essence]]'', or that which the schoolmen scruple not to call the ''[[quiddity]]'' of a thing, namely, the ''[[property (philosophy)|attribute]]'' or ''attributes'' on whose score it is what it is, whether the thing be [[matter|corporeal]] or not, as when we attempt to define the ''nature'' of an ''[[angle]]'', or of a ''[[triangle]]'', or of a ''[[fluid]]'' body, as such. Sometimes we take ''nature'' for an internal principle of [[motion (physics)|motion]], as when we say that a stone let fall in the [[air (classical element)|air]] is by ''nature'' carried towards the centre of the [[earth (classical element)|earth]], and, on the contrary, that [[fire (classical element)|fire]] or flame does ''naturally'' move upwards toward [[firmament|heaven]]. Sometimes we understand by ''nature'' the established course of things, as when we say that ''nature'' makes the [[night]] succeed the [[day]], ''nature'' hath made [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]] necessary to the [[life]] of men. Sometimes we take ''nature'' for an [[physiology|aggregate of powers]] belonging to a body, especially a living one, as when [[physician]]s say that ''nature'' is strong or weak or spent, or that in such or such [[disease]]s ''nature'' left to herself [[immune system|will do the cure]]. Sometimes we take nature for the [[universe]], or system of the corporeal works of [[God]], as when it is said of a [[phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]], or a [[chimera (mythology)|chimera]], that there is no such thing in ''nature'', i.e. in the world. And sometimes too, and that most commonly, we would express by ''nature'' a [[mother nature|semi-deity]] or other strange kind of being, such as this discourse examines the notion of.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And besides these more absolute acceptions, if I may so call them, of the word ''nature'', it has divers others (more relative), as ''nature'' is wont to be set or in [[opposite (semantics)|opposition]] or contradistinction to other things, as when we say of a stone when it falls downwards that it does it by a ''[[classical elements|natural motion]]'', but that if it be thrown upwards its motion that way is ''violent''. So chemists distinguish [[vitriol]] into ''natural'' and ''fictitious'', or made by art, i.e. by the intervention of human power or skill; so it is said that [[water (classical element)|water]], kept suspended in a sucking pump, is not in its ''natural'' place, as that is which is stagnant in the well. We say also that wicked men are still in the state of ''nature'', but the regenerate in a state of ''[[divine grace|grace]]''; that cures wrought by [[medicine]]s are natural operations; but the [[miraculous]] ones wrought by [[Christ]] and his [[apostle (Christian)|apostle]]s were ''supernatural''.&lt;ref&gt;

The term "supernatural" is often used interchangeably with [[paranormal]] or [[preternatural]]&amp;nbsp;— the latter typically limited to an adjective for describing abilities which appear to exceed what is possible within the boundaries of the laws of physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=znMqAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22supernatural+beliefs%22+%22paranormal%22&amp;dq=%22supernatural+beliefs%22+%22paranormal%22 |title=The paranormal |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=July 26, 2010|isbn=9780824210922 |year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Epistemology|Epistemologically]], the relationship between the supernatural and the natural is indistinct in terms of natural phenomena that, ''ex hypothesi,'' violate the laws of nature, in so far as such laws are [[Philosophical realism|realistically accountable]].

Many supporters of supernatural explanations believe that past, present, and future complexities and mysteries of the [[universe]] cannot be explained solely by naturalistic means and argue that it is reasonable to assume that a non-natural entity or entities resolve the unexplained.

Views on the "supernatural" vary, for example it may be seen as:

* '''indistinct from nature'''. From this perspective, some events occur according to the [[Natural law|laws of nature]], and others occur according to a separate set of principles external to known nature. For example, in Scholasticism, it was believed that God was capable of performing any miracle so long as it didn't lead to a logical [[contradiction]]. Some religions posit immanent deities, however, and do not have a tradition analogous to the supernatural; some believe that everything anyone experiences occurs by the will ([[occasionalism]]), in the mind ([[neoplatonism]]), or as a part ([[nondualism]]) of a more fundamental divine reality ([[platonism]]).
* '''incorrect human attribution'''. In this view all events have natural and only natural causes. They believe that human beings ascribe supernatural attributes to purely natural events, such as [[lightning]], [[rainbow]]s, [[flood]]s, and the [[origin of life]].&lt;ref name="Zhong1976"&gt;{{cite book |author=Zhong Yang Yan Jiu Yuan |author2=Min Tsu Hsüeh Yen Chiu So |year=1976 |title=Bulletin of the Institute of Ethnology, Academia Sinica, Issues 42–44 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yyQZAAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellis2004"&gt;{{cite book |first=B.J. |last=Ellis |first2=D.F. |last2=Bjorklund |year=2004 |title=Origins of the Social Mind: Evolutionary Psychology and Child Development |publisher=Guilford Publications |isbn=9781593851033 |lccn=2004022693 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-UjiZwYGdFoC&amp;pg=PA413 |page=413}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the concept==
Dialogues from [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic philosophy]] in the third century AD contributed the development of the concept the supernatural via [[Christian theology]] in later centuries.&lt;ref&gt;"The eventual development of a clear concept of the supernatural in Christian theology was promoted both by dialogues with heretics and by the influence of Neoplatonic philosophy."

In the medieval period, "nature" had ten different meanings and "natural" had eleven different meanings.&lt;ref name="Bartlett"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bartlett |first1=Robert |title=The Natural and the Supernatural in the Middle Ages |date=14 March 2008 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=d9O3PtKMPNsC&amp;pg=PA1 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0521702550 |chapter=1. The Boundaries of the Supernatural |pages=1–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Lombard]], a medieval scholastic in the 12th century, asked about causes that are beyond nature, in that how there could be causes that were God's alone. He used the term ''praeter naturam'' in his writings.&lt;ref name="Bartlett" /&gt; In the scholastic period, [[Thomas Aquinas]] classified miracles into three categories: "above nature", "beyond nature", and "against nature". In doing so, he sharpened the distinction between nature and miracles more than the early Church Fathers had done.&lt;ref name="Bartlett" /&gt; As a result, he had created a dichotomy of sorts of the natural and supernatural.&lt;ref&gt;"Saint Thomas's important contribution to the emergence of a technical theology of the supernatural represents a special development of the concept of surpassing effects. Saint Thomas and others of the Scholastics have left us as one of their legacies a dichotomy between the natural and the supernatural that is theologically rooted in the distinction between the Order of Nature and the Order of Grace."

'''''TeenPact Leadership Schools''''' (a.k.a., '''''TeenPact''''') is a [[Christian]] [[non-profit]] educational ministry, known for its teen-oriented programs on leadership, citizenship, and government. The organization teaches annual classes in the capitols of 41 American states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teenpact.com/stateclass/calendar.php As of 2014, taken from TeenPact's latest class schedule] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410003320/http://teenpact.com/stateclass/calendar.php |date=2008-04-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its vision statement/slogan is "Changing Lives to Change the World," and its mission statement is, "to train youth to understand the political process, value their liberty, defend their Christian faith and engage the culture at a time in their lives when, typically, they do not care about such things". &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teenpact,com/about/]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programs and Events ==
TeenPact offers "state classes" and "alumni events," the former focusing on state government and politics, and the latter on a wide variety of topics. All students must complete their state's four-day State Class at least once before they can participate in alumni events. 

=== The State Class ===
The State Class is the base level and foundation of the TeenPact organization. This class runs from Monday through Thursday of a given week at students' respective state capitols, is designed for students of ages 13 through 19, and is billed as a "hands-on learning experience."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teenpact.com/about/ From "About TeenPact"]&lt;/ref&gt; In this class, students participate in a variety of activities, encompassing many aspects of their particular state government as well as the [[Christian]] emphasis of the program. The class consists of student mock legislative sessions, learning how bills become law, field experiences (such as interviewing lobbyists), and special speakers (often state legislators or activists).  On the Christian side of the program, students participate in worship sessions, bible study, and prayer walks through the various state capitols. Because of the on-site exams and pre-class homework, TeenPact describes its class as being worth one-third of a high-school [[carnegie unit]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} After completing the four-day State Class, a student is eligible to attend Alumni Events.

All students are required to wear what the ministry describes as "formal business attire" at their politically-oriented State Classes as well as parts of some Alumni Events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://teenpact.com/state-classes/dress-code/ TeenPact Dress Code]&lt;/ref&gt; This professional dress code requires skirts for women.  During events that do not take place in a "professional environment," however, dress codes are much more relaxed for both sexes, and women are permitted to wear pants or shorts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://teenpact.com/state-classes/dress-code/ TeenPact Dress Code; note Casual Attire sections]&lt;/ref&gt;

TeenPact also offers a one-day State Class (formerly known as "TeenyPact") for younger students. It is a branch of the four-day class, held on Friday immediately following TeenPact "graduation." This class is designed as a compact and simplified version of the longer class, tailored to students ages 8 through 12. It includes many of the events of the upper level in a more age appropriate and fast-paced environment. {{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

A Political Communication Workshop (formerly a Public Speaking Class) is also offered as an extension of the week for four-day students, and is also held on the Friday following the normal TeenPact program, occurring simultaneously with the one-day class. In the workshop, the older students are developed and polished in the simple fundamentals of [[Public speaking|oratory]], including [[eye contact]], [[Body language|stage movement]] and gestures, speech writing, [[impromptu speaking]], and the basics of civilized [[debate]], as well as drafting mock [[Resolution (law)|resolutions]] similar to mock legislation drafted during the State Class.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

=== Alumni Events ===
Once a student has attended the four-day class, he or she is classified as a "TeenPact Alumnus" and is eligible for participation in any of the several additional events TeenPact offers.

The largest Alumni event in terms of participation is TeenPact's National Convention (commonly referred to as "NC"). The week-long event includes speakers, worship sessions, small group activities, and sports tournaments including [[Ultimate Frisbee]], [[volleyball]] and soccer, and student elections. Students run in national elections for various mock positions, including President and Vice-President, Senator, and Representative. This aspect of the event immerses students into the campaign process, with candidates creating websites, T-shirts, flyers, posters, and commercials. The entire elections process is tracked from primaries to the general election via a live news program, "TPN News."

TeenPact also offers week-long events focused on the three branches of government. TeenPact Congress, held at the [[Florida State Capitol]], immerses students into the legislative process, complete with elected officials, lobbyists, and journalists. TeenPact Back to DC, held at the [[Leadership Institute]] in [[Arlington, Virginia]], offers a more comprehensive curriculum on campaigning, which students use to run mock presidential campaigns. In addition to this, students commute to downtown [[Washington, D.C.]] daily, where they have the opportunity to visit [[Capitol Hill]], tour monuments and museums, and attend political conferences such as the [[Values Voter Summit]] (which Back to DC is usually scheduled around). Finally, TeenPact Judicial is a legal-oriented course held at [[Liberty University School of Law]], which includes lectures from various presenters and a [[moot court]]. TeenPact is an independent non-profit organization unaffiliated with a political party.

Three of TeenPact's Alumni events - Venture, Endeavor, and Survival - are not politically oriented, and are run in the tradition of a [[summer camp]] for males, females, and [[Mixed-sex education|co-eds]], respectively.

== Staff ==
TeenPact is run through several tiers of administration. A [[board of directors]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://teenpact.com/about/who-we-are/board-of-directors/ Official list of board members] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102162608/http://teenpact.com/about/who-we-are/board-of-directors/ |date=2013-11-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has executive control of the organization, with Founder and President [[Tim Echols]] serving as chairman of the board.  A separate staff of employees in [[Richmond, Virginia]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://teenpact.com/contact/ Official list of office staff members]&lt;/ref&gt; headed by CEO Peter Martin, directs the state classes and handles [[public relations]]. However, the bulk of TeenPact's field staff responsible for executing classes is composed of two sets of volunteers. A group of traveling student interns&lt;ref&gt;[http://teenpact.com/about/who-we-are/traveling-intern-team/ Official list of traveling interns] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102162705/http://teenpact.com/about/who-we-are/traveling-intern-team/ |date=2013-11-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is assembled each year to travel to and lead each state's classes, while individual staffing volunteers - student alumni selected via an applications process - stay in their home state or travel at their own expense to assist in leading the class. Whether an intern within the multi-state group or an individual in a single state, TeenPact volunteers are required to have attended the four-day class held in their state at least once. Traveling interns must also have previously staffed a state class, and have had sufficient experience with the Alumni programs.

== Political activity ==

TeenPact students occasionally organize "Student Projects," which may involve a political activity or other types of volunteering. TeenPact's founder, Tim Echols, was on one occasion the subject of questions regarding the ethicality of TeenPact students working on a political campaign ([[John Oxendine]]'s unsuccessful 2010 GA gubernatorial campaign). A formal ethics complaint was filed against Echols, then serving as Oxendine's campaign manager, alleging that his Gold Dome Consulting firm improperly benefited from TeenPact volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlantaunfiltered.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Tim-Echols-Ethics-Complaint.pdf Archived copy of the ethics complaint, later dismissed]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajc.com/news/news/local-govt-politics/teenpact-kids-campaign-efforts-raise-questions/nQhJF/ "TeenPact kids' campaign efforts raise questions," ''Atlanta Journal-Constitution'', July 1, 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100705120344/http://www.myfoxatlanta.com/dpp/news/politics/teen-outreach-oxendine-questioned-20100701-ap-es "Teen outreach for Oxendine questioned," ''MyFoxAtlanta.com'', July 1, 2010.

More recent TeenPact publications note the ministry's status as a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization and clarify that "Student Projects are organized by parents and/or students, not the ministry itself."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gateenpactnews.org/summer-2014.html Georgia TeenPact newsletter referencing Student Project policies; see Page 8] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028152438/http://www.gateenpactnews.org/summer-2014.html |date=2014-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20141029012954/http://ga-teenpact-events.weebly.com/organize-an-event.html TeenPact policy on student projects]&lt;/ref&gt; The "Student Project" moniker may therefore be applied not only to political campaigns, but also to a number of service and volunteering opportunities available to TeenPact alums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gateenpactevents.weebly.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029004859/http://gateenpactevents.weebly.com/ |archivedate=2014-10-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tim Echols has stepped back from the day-to-day operations of the organization in order to serve as a commissioner on the State of Georgia's Public Service Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://teenpact.com/about/who-we-are/meet-the-founder/ |title=About Tim Echols |access-date=2013-11-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102162859/http://teenpact.com/about/who-we-are/meet-the-founder/ |archive-date=2013-11-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thomas Menamparampil''' [[Salesians of Don Bosco|SDB]] (born 22 October 1936 in [[Palai]], [[India]] ) is currently the apostolic administrator  of [[Diocese of Jowai]] appointed by [[Pope Francis]] on 3 February 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assamtimes.org/node/9525|title=Archbishop Menamparampil moves a third time |publisher=Assam Times |accessdate=8 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as the bishop of Dibrugarh for 11 years and the Archbishop of [[Archdiocese of Guwahati|Guwahati]] for 20 years before his retirement on 18 January 2012.

==Personal life==

Menamparampil entered the Congregation of the [[Salesians of Don Bosco]] and made his first religious profession on 24 May 1955.

==Prelate==
He received the sacrament of the priesthood by Bishop Stephen Ferrando SDB on 2 May 1965 after studying philosophy and Catholic theology. From 1969 to 1970, he completed a master's degree in history and English. From 1972 to 1974 he was the vice-provincial in [[Guwahati]].

'''''To the Golden Cities: Pursuing the American Jewish Dream in Miami and L.A.''''' is an April 1994 book written by [[Deborah Dash Moore]] and published by [[Free Press (publisher)|The Free Press]]. It discusses the Jewish communities that formed in [[Los Angeles]] and [[Miami]] in the post-[[World War II]] period. Moore argued that the migration to new communities helped American Jews find their identities and that they "reinvented" themselves.&lt;ref name=Mohlp184&gt;Mohl, p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Jenna Weissman Joselit of the [[New York University]] Department of Liberal Studies described Moore as "one of this generation's foremost historians of America's Jews".&lt;ref name=Joselitp739&gt;Joselit, p. 739.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of publication Moore was [[Vassar College]]'s American culture program director.&lt;ref name=Patron&gt;Patron, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore characterizes Jews who moved into newly established cities; which had a lack of established culture and tradition, mild climates, and lifestyles perceived as being casual; as "permanent tourists".&lt;ref name=Glatt&gt;Glatt, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; The references include monographs and interviews.&lt;ref name=Sochenp96&gt;Sochen, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

Raymond A. Mohl of ''[[American Jewish History]]'' wrote that the oral history and archival research supporting the book serves as its "great strength".&lt;ref name=Mohlp185&gt;Mohl, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; Carol R. Glatt of the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Affairs]] Medical Center Library, [[Philadelphia]] wrote that the book's documentation was "solid".&lt;ref name=Glatt/&gt;

==Content==
The book covers the post-[[World War II]] period up until the early 1960s.&lt;ref name=Patron/&gt;

Stephen J. Whitfield of [[Brandeis University]] stated that the book focuses more on similarities between Los Angeles and Miami rather than differences; he argued that "southern regionalists" may dispute the technique, but that "her approach is compelling when framed within Jewish history".&lt;ref name=Whitfieldp235&gt;Whitfield, p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt;

Joselit wrote that Moore emphasizes that "the Jewish historical experience, from Minsk to Miami, is grounded less in the particularities of place-in the "style of the landscape"-than in its promise" and that "the sense of possibility" appears throughout the work.&lt;ref&gt;Joselit, p. 743.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore stated that Jewish culture continued to thrive in Los Angeles and Miami even though some individuals decades earlier predicted it would evaporate, and therefore she argued that Jewish culture will continue to be intact.&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Atar, p. 105. "Deborah Dash Moore argues that the establishment of Jewish life[...]"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Glatt wrote that the book had a "fluid, readable style" and that "This seminal work will be widely read."&lt;ref name=Glatt/&gt;

Joselit wrote that much of the phenomena described in the book "have as much to do with postwar America more generally than with the
specific geographical contours of Miami and Los Angeles".&lt;ref name=Joselitp742&gt;Joselit, p. 742.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mohl wrote that ''To the Golden Cities'' was overall "an excellent book, deeply researched and extremely readable", but he took issue with the book's central thesis that the new Jewish society formed in Miami and Los Angeles, arguing that it also could have formed in suburbs of older cities and that social and political movements divided Jews in the North, not only in the South.&lt;ref&gt;Mohl, p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eugene Patron of ''[[The Forward]]'' wrote that the book "for the most part [...] is an engaging exploration of what has been an untold story" although "an overload of details" sometimes "bogs down" the book.&lt;ref name=Patron/&gt;

June Sochen of the [[Northeastern Illinois University]] Department of History wrote that "has done a fine job of synthesizing" its sources "to produce the first important analysis of this migration" and that the book "will be the foundation upon which future studies of the subject are built."&lt;ref name=Sochenp96/&gt;

Whitfield stated that the book was "the best social history of Miami Jewry" because ''To The Golden Cities'' "is also the ''only'' serious history of that community" and therefore giving this distinction would be "faint praise".&lt;ref name=Whitfieldp235/&gt; Whitfield praised the "clear and unobtrusive" design and prose and the research undertaken, but he argued that the phenomena happening in Miami and Los Angeles also happened in the north and that the events reflect broader Jewish history rather than specific histories of the U.S. [[Sunbelt]].&lt;ref&gt;Whitfield, p. 235-236.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gozanze Myo o.jpg|thumb|260px|降三世明王]]

'''Trailokyavijaya''' ([[Vajrayana]], ch : 降三世明王, Xiángsānshì míngwáng, ja : Gōzanze Myō-ō;) is the King of knowledge having conquered the three worlds, one of the five kings of knowledge of [[Buddhism]]. His mission is to protect the eastern part of the world.

In general, the three worlds represent the world of desire, the world of form and the formless world; some interpret this king of knowledge is called so because he wants to defeat the supreme leader of the three worlds, {{IAST|Maheśvara}} ([[Shiva]]); The most logical explanation reveals that the three worlds denote the three poisons: greed, hatred and ignorance, three trends that humans can not conquer during the past, present and future that the king hoped to help people eliminate.

==Iconographic representation==
The Lord Trailokyavijaya was born from the blue syllable, Hûm. He is blue, with four faces, and eight arms. His primary face expresses a love fury, the right, anger, disgust in the left, and behind, that of heroism. His main hands bear the bell and lightning, his chest says ''Vajra-hum-Kara''; his three right hands hold (in descending order) a sword, the elephant hook, and an arrow; the three left hands hold a bow, lace, and a [[discus]]. With his left foot, he steps on [[Shiva]] and with the right foot, he treads on the breasts of [[Parvati]]. He carries, among other adornments, a garland made of a cord of Buddhas, is being developed as identical to him, that has (according fingers) magic gesture after touching fists back to back, attach two small chain-like fingers. The formula is "Om", etc.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Foucher : Study on Buddhist iconography of India from unpublished texts, Paris, E. Leroux, 1905.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buswell Jr.|first1=Robert E.|last2=Lopez, Jr.|first2=Donald S.|title=The Princeton dictionary of Buddhism|date=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=9781400848058|page=920|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DXN2AAAAQBAJ|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mantra==
The magic mantra of the King of knowledge having conquered the three worlds is:

The 499 CE '''''Zhen'gao''''' or '''''Zhengao''''' (真誥, '''''Declarations of the Perfected''''') is the [[Shangqing School|Shangqing Daoist]] patriarch [[Tao Hongjing]]'s comprehensive collection of poetry and prose from the original "Shangqing [[revelation]]s", which were supposedly given to the mystic [[Yang Xi]] by a group of Daoist ''[[zhenren]]'' Perfected Ones from 364 to 370. This classic text has long been famous both as a foundational text of religious Daoism and as a brilliant exemplar of [[Six Dynasties poetry|medieval Chinese poetry]].

==History==
{{Main|Yang Xi#Shangqing revelations}}
[[File:Stone Carvings at Tongxuan Taoist Temple 06 2014-09.JPG|thumb|Statues of the Three Lords Mao (Mao Ying 茅盈, Mao Gu 茅固, and Mao Zhong 茅衷), Tongxuan Taoist Temple, [[Hangzhou]]]]
The ''Zhengao'' is a compendium of Shangqing Daoist materials transmitted by the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Eastern Jin dynasty]] scholar and [[mysticism|mystic]] Yang Xi (330-c. 386) and his patrons Xu Mi (許谧, 303-376) and Xu Hui (許翽, 341-c. 370). The large, aristocratic [[Xu (surname)#Origin of the surname .E8.A8.B1.2F.E8.AE.B8 X.C7.94|Xu]] (許) family was from [[Jurong, Jiangsu]], which was the Eastern Jin capital [[Jiankang]] (modern [[Nanjing]]) from 317 to 420. Following the Xu family tradition of government service, Xu Mi and his son Hui were officials in the court of [[Emperor Ai of Jin|Emperor Ai]], unlike Xu Mi's elder brother Xu Mai (許邁, 300-348) who converted to the [[Way of the Celestial Masters]], resigned from his official career and devoted himself to Daoist studies and practices. In 362, the Xus employed Yang Xi as their household shaman and spiritual advisor, and two years later when he first established contact with the Perfected Ones from the previously unknown heaven of Shangqing (上清, Highest/Supreme Clarity), they prophesied that the Xu family would have an important role in transmitting the prophetic revelations (Robinet 2008b: 1248).

According to [[Shangqing School]] tradition, between 364 and 370, Yang Xi had a series of midnight visions in which Perfected Ones appeared to him in order to reveal their sacred scriptures, talismans, and secret registers, as well as their instructions conncerning personal matters such as health and longevity (Schipper 1999: 403). Yang wrote down the content of every vision in [[Religious ecstasy|ecstatic]] verse, recording the date along with the name and description of each Perfected who appeared. The purpose of the revelations was to set up a new syncretic faith that claimed to be superior to all earlier Daoist traditions (Espessett 2008: 1147). Most texts revealed by Yang Xi were intended for the family patriarch Xu Mi, his relatives, and friends.

The visions appeared to Yang Xi alone, and he said the Perfected directed him to transcribe the revelations for transmission to Xu Mi and Xu Hui, who would make additional copies (Strickmann 1977: 16). The ''Zhen'gao'' says the Perfected women told Yang that since they could not express themselves in debased human writing, he would act as an intermediary, rendering their words in his own outstanding calligraphy. After each transmission the Perfected checked that he transcribed their words correctly and then "presented" it back to him as if they had written it themselves (Bokenkamp 1996: 167). The heavenly maidens who visited Yang at night "never write themselves, neither with their hands nor with their feet", but instead would take his hand and engage him in a "sublime relationship" while he transcribed the sacred texts (tr. Ledderose 1984: 254, 256).

The Perfected who appeared to Yang Xi constituted three groups (Smith 2013: 16). The first were early saints in the Shangqing movement. The three brothers Mao Ying (茅盈), Mao Gu (茅固), and Mao Zhong (茅衷), referred to as the Three Lords Mao, supposedly lived in the [[Western Han dynasty]]. Perfected Lady [[Wei Huacun]] (252-334), a [[Way of the Celestial Masters]] adept proficient in [[Daoist meditation]] techniques was among the Perfected, and she became Yang's ''xuanshi'' (玄師, Teacher in the Invisible World) (Strickmann 1977: 41). Another notable example is the legendary ''[[Xian (Daoism)|xian]]'' transcendent Zhou Yishan (周義山, b. 80 BCE). The second group includes Yang Xi's bride, the Perfected Consort An (安妃), the Ninefold Florescent Perfected Consort in the Upper Palace of Purple Clarity, and her mythological parents [[Yu Shi|Master Redpine]] and Lady Li (李夫人). The third are the [[Queen Mother of the West]]'s daughters, such as the Lady of Purple Tenuity (紫微夫人) who served as matchmaker between Yang Xi and Consort An.

After Xu Mi died in 376, Xu Hui's son Xu Huangmin (許黄民, 361-429) spent several years compiling all the available Yang-Xu transcribed texts. He first distributed copies among the Xu family and their friends. Early readers of these revealed texts were impressed both by the erudite literary style of ecstatic verse and the artistic calligraphy of Yang Xi and Xu Hui (Strickmann 1977: 3, 42).

Manuscripts concerning the Shangqing revelations later were collected by several eminent Daoists. Notably, Gu Huan (顧歡, c. 425-c. 487) edited a compilation of Yang-Xu texts entitled ''Zhenji'' (真跡, Traces of the Perfected), which became the model for Tao Hongjing's 499 ''Zhen'gao''. Tao's postface notes differences between the two collections of Yang-Xu manuscripts. The ''Zhenji'' includes secondary texts such as biographies of the Daoist hermit Xu Mai by his famous calligrapher friends [[Wang Xizhi]] and [[Wang Xianzhi (calligrapher)|Wang Xianzhi]], while the ''Zhen'gao'' is restricted to the revealed texts and their historical context. Gu's work was composed of [[facsimile]] tracings of the manuscripts, while Tao's more accessible work included his calligraphic analysis of who wrote each component text (Strickmann 1977: 32).

The eminent Shangqing scholar and alchemist [[Tao Hongjing]] (456-536) collected, annotated, and redacted all the available autograph fragmentary Yang-Xu manuscripts Kohn 2008b: 119). Based upon his remarkable familiarity with the calligraphy of Yang Xi, Xu Mi, and Xu Hui, Tao was able to judge authenticity and to eliminate forgeries, resulting in an early example of [[Textual criticism|text-critical]] scholarship (Robinet 2008b: 1248). Tao's painstakingly endeavors resulted in two texts. The esoteric c. 493-514 ''Dengzhen yinjue'' (登真隱訣, Concealed Instructions for the Ascent to Perfection), which provides technical guidance for Shangqing adepts, and the 499 ''Zhen'gao'', which was intended for a broader audience of laypeople (Robinet 2008b: 1249).

Tao Hongjing's ''Zhen'gao'' Declarations of the Perfected survives as a complete work, with interpolations and commentarial additions. Standard editions are found in the 1444 ''[[Daozang]]'' Daoist Canon (CT 1016) and the 1782 ''[[Siku Quanshu]]'' literary collection. The [[Textus Receptus|received text]] of ''Zhen'gao'' is dated 499, with a preface by Gao Sisun (高似孫) dated 1223 (Robinet 2008b: 1248, 206).

In English, there are only partial translations of the ''Zhen'gao''. Bokenkamp (1996) translated some prose and seven poems, Kroll (1996) translated nine poems, and Schipper (1999) two (Komjathy 2004: 42-43). Smith (2013) made an annotated translated of Chapter 1.
	
In Japanese, there are ''Zhen'gao'' (''Shinkō'') reference works and a full translation. Ishii (1971–72) and (1987) compiled indexes of the people, places, and titles mentioned in the text, and Mugitani (1991) created a concordance. Yoshikawa and Mugitani (2000) wrote an annotated translation (Fabrizio 2008: 1329).

==Title==
Tao Hongjing titled his book with ''zhēn'' (真 or 眞, "real; true; perfected"; as in Gu Huan's ''Zhenji'' Traces of the Perfected) and ''gào'' (誥 , "proclamation; announcement"), denoting that its contents were divinely inspired. Daoist ''zhenren'' "Perfected" deities ''gao'' "dictated" the Shangqing revelations to highly literate medium and shaman Yang Xi (Schipper 1999: 402).

In the [[History of the Chinese language|historical linguistics of the Chinese language]], "Medieval Chinese" was used in texts during the 4th and 5th centuries when the ''Zhen'gao'' was written and compiled. Owing to the significant differences in word meanings between Medieval and [[Modern Chinese]], the following semantic discussion of ''zhen'' and ''gao'' will summarize English translation equivalents from Paul W. Kroll's dictionary of [[Classical Chinese|Classical]] and Medieval Chinese (2017).

''Zhēn'' (from [[Middle Chinese]] ''tsyin'') (眞 or 真) had complex abstract meanings. 
#real, true &lt; true to its own nature; natural, authentic, genuine. … a. what really is supposed to be … b. pure, perfect, of thoroughgoing genuineness … c. realize(d), perfect(ed), actualize or bring to completion one's inherent qualities … d. ideal, worthy to be imitated.
#true &lt; what is real and not illusory … a. consistent with fact or reality … b. accurate; truthful(ness); verity …
#really, actually, truly, indeed. … (Kroll 2017: 598-599)

The Daoist term ''zhēnrén'' (真人) has many English translations such as "Real Person", "Authentic Person", "True Person", "Perfected Person", and "Perfected" (Miura 2008b: 1265). Kroll clarifies the difference between Daoist and Buddhist usages: "(1.c.) ''zhēnrén'', Realized Persons, the Perfected, term found as early as the 6th chapter of ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'' and used in various movements, but esp[ecially] influential in Shangqing Dao[ism] to designate the highest class of divine beings whose home is in the Shangqing heaven and who are completely spiritualized."; "(2.) … ''zhēnrén'', "one who embodies truth," [transcription] of Sanskrit ''[[arhat]]''…

Chinese ''zhēn'' "real; true; genuine; etc." is written with several [[Variant Chinese character|variant characters]] in [[East Asian languages]], illustrating the [[Unicode compatibility characters|Unicode compatibility]] difficulties with encoding [[CJK characters|CJK [Chinese, Japanese, and Korean] characters]].

The early graph [[wikt:眞|眞]] (U+771E) is now an outdated [[Traditional Chinese characters|traditional Chinese character]], Korean ''[[hanja]]'', Vietnamese [[Chữ Nôm]], and Japanese ''[[kyūjitai]]'' ("old character form") ''[[kanji]]''. There are variations of the calligraphic [[Stroke (CJKV character)|strokes]] below the ''mù'' 目 "eye" component in 眞. This 10-stroke 眞 graph has a single "down and right" pattern (cf. 乚); which the 11-stroke 眞 (U+2F945) replaces with a 2-stroke "down and stop, right" version.

The modern [[wikt:真|真]] is both the traditional and [[simplified Chinese character]], and the Japanese ''[[shinjitai]]'' ("new character form"). Note the change of the original ''bǐ'' 匕 "spoon" at the top of 眞 (compare the [[Small seal script]] in the [[infobox]] above) to ''shí'' 十 "ten". There are Sino-Japanese variations on the horizontal line below the 目 "eye" element; Chinese {{lang|zh|真}} (U+771F) connects it with the horizontal line, while Japanese {{lang|ja|真}} (U+2F947) separates them.

''Gào'' (Middle Chinese ''kawH'') 誥 had comparatively more concrete semantics.
#proclaim, proclamation; announce(ment); from med[ieval] times exclusively superior to inferior. … a. royal proclamation conferring noble title or special recognition; entitlement.
#exhortation; advisory instruction to subordinate, monition.
#oracle, announcement from a divinity. (Kroll 2017: 130)
The traditional Chinese character 誥 or simplified 诰 is classified as a [[Chinese character classification#Phono-semantic compound characters|radical-phonetic character]],  composed from the [[Radical 149|"speech" radical]] ''yán'' 言 and a ''gào'' (MC ''kawh'' or ''kowk'') 告 "announce, proclaim; report; exhort; accuse" phonetic element.

Scholars either [[Transliteration of Chinese|transliterate]] the title (''Zhen'gao'', ''Zhen Gao'', ''Chen-kao'', etc.) or translate it:
*True Reports (Needham and Wang 1956)
*Declarations of Perfected Immortals (Needham and Lu 1974)
*Proclamations of the Perfected (Eskildsen 1998)
*Pronouncements of the Perfected (Schipper 1999)
*Authentic Declarations and Declarations of the Perfected (Robinet 2008a and 2008b)
*The Proclamation of the Perfect (Theobald 2011)
Note that the correct [[pinyin]] romanization of the title 真誥 is ''Zhen'gao'', but some sources give ''Zhengao'', comparable with misspelling the city ''[[Xi'an]]'' as ''Xian''. The uncommon [[Pinyin#Pronunciation of initials|pinyin apostrophe]] (') is only used to remove ambiguity about syllabification in a polysyllabic word. That is, to differentiate the spelling ''zhen'gao'' (''zhen'' 真 "perfect" and ''gao'' 誥 "proclamation") from ''zheng'ao'' (''zheng'' 正 "straight" and ''ao'' 傲 "proud"), as in the name of the Chinese soccer player [[Sun Zheng'ao]].

==Content==
The ''Zhen'gao'' primarily contains Yang Xi's writings that purport to convey the teachings revealed in his spiritual visions (Eskildsen 1998: 72). Tao Hongjing's redacted fragments relate the circumstances of the revelations, the Perfected Ones' explanations and interpretations of their scriptures and methods, private correspondences between Yang and the Xus, and responses to their direct questions addressed to the Shangqing divinities. Tao regularly comments on the authenticity of a text and whether he considered it an original Shangqing fragment (Robinet 2000: 206). Gao Sisun's preface uses the [[Warp and weft|weaving terms]] ''jīng'' (經, warp) and ''wěi'' (緯, weft)—alluding to the literary terms ''jīngshū'' (緯書, classics; scriptures) and ''wěishū'' (緯書, esoteric glosses on the classics) —to describe the ''Zhen'gao'' as the "weft" background of the Shangqing revelations (Robinet 2008b: 1249).

Tao Hongjing's received ''Zhen'gao'' is divided into seven ''piān'' (篇, chapters) and twenty ''juǎn'' (卷, volumes), but this was not the original format. It was initially arranged into ten ''juan'', or ten ''pian'' according to some later references. In the present text, chapters 1, 2, and 4 are each split in two parts, making ten chapters altogether, and the arrangement into twenty volumes results from the further subdivision of each chapter into two parts (Robinet 2008b: 1248).

Each chapter has a three-character title, emulating the [[Old Texts#Controversy among new schools|New Text school]]'s apocryphal ''chènwěi'' (讖緯, "mystical Confucian prophetical works of Eastern Han") (Theobald 2011). In the table below, chapter 1 and 2 translations are by Smith (2013) while the others are tentative.

The division into seven chapters resulted from Tao's "sometimes clumsy" effort to give coherence to the whole (Robinet 2008b: 1249). The first five chapters record the revelations of the Perfected. Chapter 1 contains texts relating Yang Xi's visions of and hymns sung by the Perfected, and fragments of Ziyang zhenren (紫陽真人, Perfected Purple Yang)'s lost ''Jianjing'' (劍經, Scripture of the Sword) with a method for making a magic sword that will provide immortality through ''[[Shijie (Daoism)|shijie]]'' (屍解, liberation by means of a simulated corpse) (Robinet 2008b: 1250). Chapters 2 and 3 are devoted to minor recipes and methods by lesser divinities, with information on the afterlife of the Xus' relatives and acquaintances, and a work revealed to Peijun (裴君, Lord Pei), the Baoshen qiju jing (寶神起居經, Scripture on the Behavior for Treasuring the Spirit) (Robinet 1984, 2: 359-362). The fourth chapter concerns Maoshan, its long history of mystics and hermits, biographies of the Mao brothers, and Guo Sichao (郭四朝), an early inhabitant of the mountain (Robinet 1984, 2: 389-98). The fifth comprises a detailed description of the Chinese [[underworld]], and may have constituted the lost ''Fengdu ji'' (酆都記, Records of [[Diyu#Conceptions|Fengdu]]), referring to the subterranean administrative headquarters of hell. Chapter 6 of the ''Zhen'gao'' consists of personal letters, memoranda, and records of dreams written by Yang and the Xus. Tao gives a detailed commentary on the texts contained in these first six chapters. The seventh chapter is Tao's postface, explaining his editorial methods, the history of the Shangqing textual corpus being scattered and plagiarized, and the Xu family genealogy (Strickmann 1977: 4). Despite this overall ordering, some sections have occasional interpolations, repetitions, and misplaced insertions, often resulting in a "confused and truncated" logical order of presentation (Robinet 2000: 206).

==Syncreticism==
Scholars have long recognized that much of the ''Zhen'gao'' content derives from a [[syncretic]] assortment of older sources from [[Wu (shaman)|''Wu'' shamanism]], [[Way of the Celestial Masters|Celestial Master Daoism]], and [[Chinese Buddhism]], despite the "resplendent homogeneity which originally disparate elements appear to have acquired in his inspired transcriptions" (Strickmann 1977: 5).

===''Wu''-shamanist influences===
The Shangqing school "succeeded in adhering to a perilous ridgeline" situated between ancient shamanism or mediumship and modern institutionalizing a church and codifying its liturgy (Robinet 1993: 228). Chinese shamanic spirit journeys are a key [[literary device]] in both ''Zhen'gao'' poems and earlier ''[[Chuci]]'' (Songs of [[Chu (state)|Chu]]) poems such as ''[[Li Sao]]'' (Encountering Sorrow), ''[[Yuan You]]'' (Far-off Journey), ''[[Jiu Ge]]'' (Nine Songs), and ''[[Jiu Bian]]'' (Nine Changes). Chinese [[Wu (shaman)|''wu'']] shamans were spirit mediums who practiced divination, prayer, sacrifice, and rainmaking. Many of their practices were later adapted by Daoists.

The ''Zhen'gao'' section recording Yang Xi's and Consort An's betrothal and "[[spirit spouse|spirit marriage]]" of illustrates how Yang adapted southern shamanic traditions. It resembles ''Chuci'' poems where male and female shamans describe their meetings, celestial travels, intercourse with nature spirits, and recount their yearnings once the spirit has gone. The passage is also an explicit renunciation of Celestial Masters marriage rites in which the initial sexual act of a bride and groom was performed ritually in the presence of the elders. The Shangqing spirit marriage between Yang and his celestial Consort also involves the merging of corporeal spirits, but all traces of the human sexual act are absent. Yang Xi names this refined type of spiritual union as ''oujing'' (偶景, "mating of the effulgent spirits") rather than the Celestial Master sexual practice of ''heqi'' (合氣, "joining of the pneumas") (Bokenkamp 1996: 168-169).

Ziwei Fujin (紫微夫人), translated as the Perfected Consort of Purple Clarity (Bokenkamp 1996) or Lady of Purple Tenuity (Smith 2013), was the celestial matchmaker between Yang Xi and Consort An. In Chinese astronomy, ''Ziwei'' (紫微, [[Purple Forbidden enclosure|Purple Clarity]]) is the name of a constellation near the [[Pole star]] that was associated with Destiny in Daoist [[Zi wei dou shu|fortune-telling]] (Bokenkamp 1996: 170).

On the night of 26 July 365, the Perfected Consort of Purple Clarity descended to Yang Xi and introduced his stunning bride Consort An. Both Perfected ladies dictated poems to ensure that Yang understood the cosmic significance of their engagement. At their spirit marriage on the next night, Consort An explains their destiny,
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is just that I grasp the crux of things and so seized this rare opportunity, thereby responding to cosmic rhythms and numerological fate. In lowering my effulgent corporeal spirits into the dust and evanescence of your world, I have harnessed them as dragons to plunge below. This was done expressly to summon to me the male who pursues the mysterious and to pursue with him an association wherein I might gain a suitable counterpart. We came together because of predestination. As a result,
&lt;poem&gt;Our records were compared, our names verified;
Our immaculate tallies joined in the jeweled realms—
Our dual felicity has been arranged:
We will travel as wild geese supporting one another.
We will share sips from a single gourd-goblet,
Toasting the nuptial quilt and knotting our lower garments.
When you look to your mate for the food she will prepare—
It is the Perfected drugs she holds inside herself. ... (tr. Bokenkamp 1996: 175-176)&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Zhen'gao'' is a unique source for understanding the ancient shamanistic Daoism of Southern China, and its ecstatic poetry shows a distinct relationship to earlier shaman-inspired literature such as in the ''Chuci'' anthology. The spiritual quest for "a divine lover who is at the same time a redeemer" is a central theme in the ''Zhen Gao'', and the male and female Daoist adepts exchange love poems with their immortal counterparts, in celebration of their ecstatic union (Schipper 1999: 403). Take for instance, the "Song of Consort An" that she dictated to Yang Xi.
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
My chariot has departed from the realm of Western Flowers,
Wandering between the worlds of impermanence and transcendence.
I now look at the summits of the [[Sacred Mountains of China#The Five Great Mountains|Five Marchmounts]],
Then again I bathe myself in the Milky Way.
Leaving my chariot behind, I search for an empty vessel,
In all this I am full of passionate feelings,
Who like a mustard grain can suddenly grow to cover ten thousand acres!
In the center stands [[Mount Meru|Mount Sumeru]]:
There is no difference between large and small.
The same cause stands at the root of what is far and near;
You come from the impermanent world of phenomena.
But I love you as a transcendent being! (tr. Schipper 1999: 403, cf. Smith 2013: 162) &lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Among the Perfected who transmitted poetry to Yang Xi, the most prolific (9 poems from 21 August 365 to 28 May 366) was Lady Youying (右英婦人), the thirteenth daughter of the goddess [[Queen Mother of the West]]. All nine were "seduction songs" for Yang's patron Xu Mi, who the Perfected said was destined to join Lady Youying in spirit marriage and ascend to Shangqing heaven. At that time Xu Mi was in his early sixties, and seen by the Perfected to be entangled in earthly, carnal desires. Lady Youying hoped that her poetry, filled with the colors, sounds, and scenes of the celestial regions, will convince him to join her in a mystical [[sacred marriage]] in the "unseen realm" (Kroll 1996: 181). However, despite Lady Youying's repeated otherworldly pleadings, Xu Mi waited over a decade to join her. He completed his official career in the capital, and moved to Maoshan where he practiced Shangqing worship until his death in 376 (Ledderose 1984: 255).

Yang recorded that Lady Youying dictated the following poem on 6 March 366.
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Reining in the sky-lights, I ascend the empyrean's dawn-source,
Rambling to revelry in the Palace of Watchet Whitecap.
Prismatic clouds wreathe the cinnabar auroras;
Numinous cumuli bestrew the Eight Hollows.
The Perfected Ones on high chant in rose-gem abodes;
Lofty Transcendents carol in blue-gem chambers.
Nine phoenixes sing through the vermilion sounding-pipes;
The rhythms of the void commingle in the plumed bells.
With our necks entwined, within the Golden Court
I'll unite with my mate amidst the unseen realm. 
Together we will tap the ichor of the jade ale—
In a flash and a flicker, are now in the nonage of infancy!
—Well then, why do you crouch athwart the worldly road,
Your lapses and maladies increasing with every day? (tr. Kroll 1996: 186)&lt;/poem&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Songs such as Lady Youying's are "direct heirs" to the ''Chuci'''s ''Yuan you'' Far-off Journey, which poetically describes a shamanic/Daoist flight around the heavens and earth (Kroll 1996: 181).

===Buddhist influences===
The [[Silk Road transmission of Buddhism]] into China began in the 1st or 2nd century CE, and the new foreign religion had become widely popular by the time the ''Zhen'gao'' was written. The Daoist [[Lingbao School]], which began in the early 5th century, borrowed many practices and terms from Buddhism (Zürcher 1980). The Shangqing Daoist ''Zhen'gao'' incorporated some passages from Buddhist texts and adapted religious concepts such as [[Buddhism and sexuality#Celibacy and monasticism|monastic celibacy]].

Some revelations the Perfected bestowed upon Yang were corrections of existing texts in other traditions. One of the clearest examples of Buddhist borrowings in the ''Zhen'gao'' is a portion of the ''Sishi'erzhang jing'' ''[[Sutra of Forty-two Chapters]]'', which is believed to have been the first Buddhist scripture translated into Chinese (Strickmann 1977: 10). The Chinese philosopher and author [[Hu Shih]] (1935) first discovered the ''Sishi'er zhang jing'' borrowings in the ''Zhen'gao'' (volumes 6 and 9, and criticized Tao Hongjing for plagiarism (Eskildsen 1998: 183).

The ''Zhen'gao'' imbeds borrowed passages within discourses attributed to Daoist deities. The following passage uses two fundamental tenets of Buddhism—''[[Dukkha]]'' "suffering; unsatisfactoriness" (Chinese ''kǔ'' 苦 "bitterness"), the first of the [[Four Noble Truths]], and ''[[Saṃsāra]]'' "karmic cycle; reincarnation" (''lúnhuí'' 輪回 "transmigration")— to exhort Shangqing adepts toward single-minded, painstaking training and to reject the futile cravings of mundane life.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Blue Boy of Fangzhu appeared and proclaimed, ''"For a person to practice the Tao is also to suffer, but to not practice the Tao is also to suffer. People from their birth reach old age, and from old age reach [the stage of] illness''. Protecting their bodies ''they reach [the point of] death. Their suffering is limitless. In their minds they worry and they accumulate transgressions. With their births and deaths unending, their suffering is difficult to [accurately and sufficiently] describe'' (emphasis added). Even more so it is because many do not live to their old age ordained by Heaven! [By saying that] to practice the Tao is also to suffer, I mean that to maintain the Perfect purely and immaculately, to guard the mysterious and long for the miraculous, to search for a teacher while struggling, to undergo hundreds of trials, to keep your heart diligent without failure, to exert your determination firmly and clearly; these are also the utmost in suffering." (vol. 6, tr. Eskildsen 1998: 73; italicized portions from ''Sishi'erzhang jing'' 35) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another recurring ''Sutra of Forty-two Chapters'' theme in the ''Zhen'gao'' is the elimination of sexual desire. One borrowed passage states, "As for what is great among longings and desires, nothing is greater than lust. The guilt it brings on has no limit, and it is a matter that cannot be forgiven." (''Zhen'gao'' 6, ''Sishi'erzhang jing'' 22, tr. Eskildsen 1998: 74). Prior to significant Buddhist influence, Daoists traditionally encouraged the practice of "[[Taoist sexual practices#Male control of ejaculation|retention of the semen]]" as a means to increase longevity, with ''jīng'' (精) meaning both physical "sperm" and spiritual "[[Jing (Chinese medicine)|essence]]" in ''[[Neidan]]'' Internal Alchemy and [[Traditional Chinese medicine]]. Thus, "The Oral Lesson of the Female Immortal, the wife of Liu Gang" warns, "Those who seek immortality must not associate with women." (''Zhen'gao'' 10, tr. Eskildsen 1998: 76).

The ''Zhen'gao'' used ''yàolì'' (藥力, "efficacy of a medicine") in an unclear meaning: "If a Taoist adept seeks to become an immortal, he must not copulate with women. Each time you copulate, you nullify a full year's medicinal strength. If you ingest nothing and engage in bedroom activities, you will lose thirty years off your life span." (10, tr. Eskildsen 1998: 75, interpreting that uncelibate adepts could take special medicines to supplement their ''jing'').

One of the primary ''Zhen'gao'' reasons for maintaining celibacy and eliminating lust was to attain direct spiritual encounters with immortals and gods. "Those who are perfect have no feelings of [erotic] passion and desire, nor any thoughts of man and woman. If [thoughts of] red and white exist in one's bosom, the sympathy of Perfected beings will not come about as a response, and Divine Women and Superior Worthies will not descend [before you]." (6, tr. Eskildsen 1998: 78). This "red and white" may refer to blood and sperm (1998: 184). The ''Zhen'gao'' poem "Spiritual Union, Not Sexual Intercourse" begins, "The world prizes sweetly scented intercourse / The way prescribes union in the mystic empyrean" (tr. Smith 2013: 137).

==Literary value==
The ''Zhen'gao'' was influential in medieval [[Chinese literature]] and continues to have extraordinary lyrical value. The works of many of China's greatest poets, including [[Li Bo]], [[Wang Wei (Tang dynasty)|Wang Wei]], [[Bo Juyi]], and [[Li Shangyin]], were influenced by it (Schipper 1999: 403).

The first readers of the ''Zhen'gao'' were Eastern Jin dynasty [[scholar-officials|literari]], well-educated intellectuals who esteemed poetic ability. The text comprises some 70 poems and songs recited to Yang Xi by the Shangqing divinities, and they communicated with verbal artistry specifically "calculated to impress and enchant" the literate aristocracy of the Eastern Jin court. Yang Xi's "virtuoso efforts combining spiritual content with lyric technique" precisely appealed to this 4th-5th century Chinese audience, since most of the Perfected Ones' verses had the then current [[jueju|pentasyllabic]] meter favored by the Eastern Jin literati themselves (Kroll 1996: 180).

For a final example of Yang Xi's literary ability, consider this description of when Lady of Purple Tenuity first appeared to him (described above). "Her garments flashed with light, illumining the room. Looking at her was like trying to discern the shape of a flake of mica as it reflects the sun. Her billowing hair, black and long at the temples, was arranged exquisitely. It was done up in a topknot on the crown of her head, so that the remaining strands fell almost to her waist. There were golden rings on her fingers and jade circlets on her arms. judging by her appearance, she must have been about thirteen or fourteen." (tr. Bokenkamp 1996: 171).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2769">'''Zoroastrian cosmology''' is divided in four periods of 3,000 years. [[Zoroaster]] was born in the beginning of the fourth period, to be succeeded at the end of each next millennium by a new saviour. When [[Saoshyant]], the third and last saviour would come the last judgment and the creation of a new world.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZP_f9icf2roC Merriam-Webster's encyclopedia of world religions].'' Pp. 1166.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation of the universe==
{{main|Zoroastrianism}}
According to the Zoroastrian [[creation myth|story of creation]], [[Ahura Mazda]] existed in light and goodness above, while [[Angra Mainyu]] existed in darkness and ignorance below. They have existed independently of each other for all time, and manifest contrary substances. Ahura Mazda first created seven abstract heavenly beings called ''[[Amesha Spenta]]s'', who support him and represent beneficent aspects, along with numerous ''yazads'', lesser beings worthy of worship. He then created the universe itself in order to ensnare evil. Ahura Mazda created the floating, egg-shaped universe in two parts: first the spiritual (''menog'') and 3,000 years later, the physical (''getig''). Ahura Mazda then created [[Keyumars|Gayomard]], the archetypical perfect man, and the first bull.&lt;ref name=Cavendish&gt;{{Citation|title=Mythology: an Illustrated Encyclopedia |pages=40–45 |first1=Richard |last1=Cavendish |first2=Trevor Oswald |last2=Ling |publisher=Rizzoli |year=1980 |isbn=0-8478-0286-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GdEnAAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Ahura Mazda created the universe and mankind, Angra Mainyu, whose instinct is to destroy, miscreated demons, evil ''yazads'', and noxious creatures (''khrafstar'') such as snakes, ants, and flies. Angra Mainyu created an opposite, evil being for each good being, except for humans, which he found he could not match. Angra Mainyu invaded the universe through the base of the sky, inflicting [[Keyumars|Gayomard]] and the bull with suffering and death. However, the evil forces were trapped in the universe and could not retreat. The dying primordial man and bull emitted seeds. From the bull's seed grew all beneficial plants and animals of the world, and from the man's seed grew a plant whose leaves became the first human couple. Man thus struggles in a two-fold universe trapped with evil. The evils of this physical world are not products of an inherent weakness, but are the fault of Angra Mainyu's assault on creation. This assault turned the perfectly flat, peaceful, and ever day-lit world into a mountainous, violent place that is half night.&lt;ref name=Cavendish/&gt;
