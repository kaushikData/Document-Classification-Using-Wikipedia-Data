==Uses==
Typical applications include marine, aircraft, architecture, general sheet metal work, heat exchangers, fuel lines and tanks, flooring panels, streetlights, appliances, rivets and wire.

The exceptional corrosion resistance of 5052 alloy against seawater and salt spray makes it a primary candidate for the failure-sensitive large marine structures, like tanks of [[liquefied natural gas]] tankers.

==Weldability==
Weldability – Gas: Good

Weldability – Arc: Very Good

Weldability – Resistance: Very Good

Brazability: Acceptable

Solderability: Not recommended

'''Adam Air Flight 574''' ('''KI574''' or '''DHI574''') was a scheduled domestic [[Airline|passenger flight]] operated by [[Adam Air]] between the Indonesian cities of [[Juanda International Airport|Surabaya]] and [[Sam Ratulangi International Airport|Manado]]&lt;ref name=forbes /&gt; that broke up in mid-air and crashed into the [[Makassar Strait]] near [[Polewali]] in [[Sulawesi]] on 1 January 2007.&lt;ref name=Wreckage /&gt; All 102 people on board died, making it the deadliest aviation accident involving a [[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-400]]. A national investigation was launched into the disaster. The final report, released on 25 March 2008, concluded that the pilots lost control of the aircraft after they became preoccupied with troubleshooting the [[inertial navigation system]] and inadvertently disconnected the autopilot.&lt;ref name="flight080325" /&gt; It was the only fatal accident for Adam Air in the company's 5-year history.

The crash is one of several transportation accidents, including the subsequent non-fatal crash of [[Adam Air Flight 172|Flight 172]], which have resulted in the United States downgrading its safety rating of Indonesian aviation, as well as subsequent and large-scale transportation safety reforms in Indonesia. All Indonesian airlines, at one time, had been [[list of air carriers banned in the European Union|banned from flying into the European Union]] several months after the crash. Adam Air was later subsequently banned from flying by the Indonesian government a few years later, and declared bankruptcy.&lt;ref name="EU removes Indonesia's flag carrier Garuda from bloc's airline blacklist" /&gt;

==History==
===Aircraft===
The aircraft involved,  Boeing 737-4Q8 [[serial number]] 24070, registration PK-KKW, was manufactured in 1989.&lt;ref name=registration /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boeing 4Q8" /&gt; Prior to service with Adam Air, owned by [[International Lease Finance Corporation|ILFC]] the aircraft had been leased to seven airlines: [[Dan-Air]], [[British Airways]], [[GB Airways]], [[Transaero]], [[WFBN]], [[Air One]] and [[Jat Airways]].&lt;ref name=history /&gt; Provided with twin [[CFM International CFM56#CFM56-3 series|CFM56-3C1]] powerplants, the plane had around 50,000 hours flying and was last evaluated and declared airworthy by the Indonesian transport ministry on 25 December 2005.&lt;ref name=servicing /&gt; It was due to be checked again in late January 2007.&lt;ref name=servicing /&gt; The Surabaya airport duty manager said that there were no technical problems with the aircraft prior to departure.&lt;ref name=newpaper /&gt;

===Pilots===
The pilot-in-command was 47-year-old Captain Refri Agustian Widodo from [[Sidoarjo]], Indonesia, who joined Adam Air in 2006. The first officer was 36-year-old Yoga Susanto, an employee of Adam Air who also joined the company in 2006. Captain Widodo was a seasoned veteran, having logged more than 13,300 hours of flying time. As pilot-in-command of Boeing 737 aircraft, he had more than 3,800 hours of experience. First Officer Susanto had 4,200 total flying hours and he had almost 1,000 hours logged as a Boeing 737 first officer.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.webcitation.org/5zltnuNI0?url=http://www.dephub.go.id/knkt/ntsc_aviation/baru/Final_Report_PK-KKW_Release.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flight chronology==
[[File:Adam Air Flight 574.png|thumbnail|Flight 574's route]]
On 1 January 2007, at 12:59 local time (05:59 [[UTC]]),&lt;ref&gt;NTSC final report, section 1.1 "History of the flight", page 5&lt;/ref&gt; the plane departed from [[Juanda International Airport|Juanda Airport]], [[Surabaya]], with 96 passengers (85 adults, 7 children and 4 infants) which represented a 56 percent [[load factor (transportation)|load factor]].&lt;ref name="Adam Air website" /&gt; and 6 crew on board.&lt;ref name=forbes /&gt; The passenger list was composed mainly of Indonesian nationals; the only foreigners were an American family of three.&lt;ref name="oregonianpassengers" /&gt; The two-hour flight, scheduled to arrive at [[Sam Ratulangi Airport]], [[Manado]], at 16:00 local time,{{ref label|time_diff|note 1|1}} was as expected until the plane disappeared from [[air traffic control]] radar screens at [[Makassar]], [[South Sulawesi]], with the last contact at 14:58 local time (06:58 UTC).&lt;ref&gt;NTSC final report, section 1.1 "History of the flight", page 8&lt;/ref&gt; The last known beacon position was detected by a Singaporean satellite.&lt;ref name="Adam Air website" /&gt; The altitude of the plane was shown as {{convert|35000|ft|sigfig=4}} on the radar screen.&lt;ref name=focus /&gt;

While cruising at 35,000&amp;nbsp;feet (10,668&amp;nbsp;m), the pilots became preoccupied with troubleshooting the aircraft's two [[Inertial navigation system|inertial reference systems]] (IRS), part of the navigation system. As they were correcting the problem, they accidentally disengaged the autopilot and failed to correct for a slow right roll even after a "[[Banked turn#Banked turn in aeronautics|bank angle]]" alarm sounded. By the time the pilots noticed the situation, the bank angle had reached 100° with almost 60° nose down attitude. Contrary to the correct recovery procedure, the pilots did not level the wings before trying to regain pitch control.&lt;ref name=ntsc_final&gt;NTSC final report&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=52}} The aircraft reached {{convert|490|kn|km/h}} at the end of the recording, in excess of the aircraft's [[never-exceed speed|maximum rated speed]] for a dive ({{convert|400|kn|km/h}}). The descent rate varied during the fatal dive, with a maximum recorded value of 53,760 feet per minute. The tailplane suffered a structural failure twenty seconds prior to the end of the recording,&lt;ref name=ntsc_final /&gt;{{rp|page=52}} at which time the investigators concluded the aircraft was in a "critically unrecoverable state". Both flight recorders ceased to function when the 737 broke up in mid-air at 9,000 feet above sea level.&lt;ref name=flight080325 /&gt;

[[File:IndonesiaSulawesi.PNG|thumb|Map showing location of Sulawesi Island (light green) among the islands of Indonesia]]

Weather in the region was stormy;&lt;ref name=edmontonsun /&gt; the [[Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics|Indonesian Bureau of Meteorology and Geophysics]] noted that the cloud thickness was up to {{convert|30000|ft|sigfig=3}} in height and [[wind speed]] at an average of {{convert|30|kn|km/h|0}} in the area.&lt;ref name="Jatuhnya Pesawat Adam Air di Sulawesi Barat Adalah Akibat Cuaca Buruk" /&gt; Although the Juanda Airport operator, PT Angkasa Pura I, had given warnings to the pilot concerning the weather condition, the plane had departed as scheduled.&lt;ref name="ANTARA01" /&gt; The plane ran into [[crosswind]]s of more than {{convert|70|kn|km/h|0}} over the [[Makassar Strait]], west of Sulawesi, where it changed course eastward toward land before losing contact.&lt;ref name=cnn0601 /&gt;

No [[distress signal]]s were sent by the aircraft.&lt;ref name=thejerusalempost /&gt;&lt;ref name="globeandmail" /&gt;

==Search and rescue efforts==

3,600 army and police personnel were mobilised in the search for the missing aircraft.&lt;ref name=swissinfo /&gt; One [[Boeing 737|Boeing 737-200]] Surveiller (a military surveillance plane), two infrared-equipped [[Fokker-50]] aircraft from the [[Republic of Singapore Air Force]],&lt;ref name="Singapore to help Indonesia locate missing Adam Air jet" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirim 2 Fokker, Singapura Siapkan Infra Red Cari AdamAir" /&gt; a [[GAF Nomad|Navy Nomad]] plane and six [[helicopter]]s were dispatched to aid searching for the missing plane from the air.&lt;ref name=swissinfo /&gt;&lt;ref name="Two mily planes help search for missing Adam Air" /&gt; The Indonesian sonar-equipped ship ''Pulau Rengat'', capable of detecting underwater metallic objects later joined the team, equipped with a mini remote-controlled submarine.&lt;ref name="Search intensifies for missing Adam Air 737" /&gt;&lt;ref name="detik07" /&gt; It searched the sea for five days between 3 and 8 January, without success.&lt;ref name="UAVhuntduration" /&gt;

[[Naval ship]]s combed the Makassar Strait while military personnel went through jungles and mountains of Sulawesi.&lt;ref name="Reuters030307" /&gt; In the face of heavy rain and strong winds in the area, the search efforts, coordinated from Makassar city, were focused in the area between the coastal town of [[Majene]] and the mountainous region of [[Toraja]].&lt;ref name="Reuters030307" /&gt; The search in the two areas was due to twin signals, each carrying different [[Emergency Position-Indicating Radio Beacon|emergency locator transmitter]] frequencies, received by the Singaporean satellite and an [[Military of Indonesia|Indonesian military]] air base.&lt;ref name="Possible in-flight blast caused plane crash on land and sea" /&gt; The two separate locations produced on radar screens were a spot on the sea in Majene and on land in [[Rantepao]], [[Tana Toraja]].&lt;ref name="Bisa Jadi Pesawat AdamAir Meledak di Udara" /&gt;{{ref label|ELT|note 2|2}} Searches were then expanded throughout the Island of Sulawesi; some were triggered by unknown distress signals received by a commercial [[Lion Air]] flight and an airport.&lt;ref name=lionairsignal /&gt; A police officer at the [[Barru]] district police operational centre said that all the districts with stretches of coastline along the Makasser Strait had teams searching for the plane.&lt;ref name=allheadlinenews /&gt;

The head of the National Search and Rescue Agency told the [[Associated Press]] that he believed the aircraft was probably lost at sea.&lt;ref name="beacondamag" /&gt; From 5 January 2007, the main focus of the search was relocated to areas south of Manado, after Manado's [[Sam Ratulangi Airport]] reported detecting a signal from the plane a day before.&lt;ref name=searchshift /&gt; However, the rugged terrain coupled with thick and low hanging clouds continued to hamper the search efforts, and three relatives of missing passengers who overflew part of the area on a military reconnaissance plane admitted that the chances of finding the plane were slim.&lt;ref name=dauntingtask /&gt; Officials said that it was unlikely any bodies had survived in one piece.&lt;ref name="thestar.com" /&gt; On 14 January, at Indonesia's request, Singapore lent four towed [[underwater locator beacon]] detectors, sometimes called Towed Pinger Locators, and six consultants in their use to aid in the search.&lt;ref name=Singaporehelp /&gt;&lt;ref name="AirWiseNews" /&gt; One week later, one of these Towed Pinger Locators, operated from the [[USNS Mary Sears (T-AGS-65)|''USNS Mary Sears'']] successfully located the black boxes.&lt;ref name="news.navy.mil" /&gt; On 24 January, the British ship MN ''Endeavour'' joined the search for wreckage. The ship is operated by local mining firm PT Gema Tera Mustikawati and is usually used by oil and gas drilling companies to map the seabed.&lt;ref name="MN Endeavour" /&gt; By then, the Indonesian government had spent an average of Rp 1 billion (about US$110,000) a day on the search.&lt;ref name=costs /&gt;

On 10 February, search operations were officially halted by the Search and Rescue Agency, according to Transportation Minister Hatta Rajasa, finalising the legal status of both the plane and its passengers and crew. This announcement allowed the families of the victims to start the insurance claims process.&lt;ref name=final /&gt;

===Unidentified submerged objects===
On Monday, 8 January, three large metal objects, suspected to be wreckage, were detected by the Indonesian ship [[KRI Fatahillah (361)|KRI ''Fatahillah'']]'s sonar.&lt;ref name=seabed /&gt; First Admiral [[Gatot Subyanto]] of the Indonesian Navy indicated three locations, between {{convert|3|–|6|km|0|abbr=on}} apart, off [[Mamuju (city)|Mamuju]] city on Sulawesi's western coast. Due to limitations of the navy's sonar equipment, it was not clear what the metal was,&lt;ref name=seabed /&gt; and Indonesia had no other equipment of its own.&lt;ref name="Indonesianaveyequipment" /&gt; A United States Navy oceanographic survey ship, [[USNS Mary Sears (T-AGS-65)|''Mary Sears'']], arrived in the area on 9 January with better equipment to help identify the objects, and on the same date a Canadian jet with five separate air crews, working in shifts, was sent to aid with aerial mapping of the suspected location.&lt;ref name="Canadians" /&gt; The [[Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries (Indonesia)|Indonesian Marine and Fishery Department]] has since suggested that the metal objects could instead have been instruments deployed to study the underwater sea current. A total of twelve Indonesian Navy ships were deployed in the area, including the [[KRI Ajak|KRI ''Ajak'']], [[KRI Leuser|KRI ''Leuser'']] and [[KRI Nala (363)|KRI ''Nala'']].&lt;ref name="Jakartapost" /&gt; Extra underwater equipment, including a metal detector and an undersea camera, was sent from the United States, and arrived aboard the USNS ''Mary Sears'' on 17 January.&lt;ref name="Jakartapost" /&gt;&lt;ref name=playfuls /&gt; The [[#Cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder|flight recorders]] were subsequently located elsewhere, in the waters in an area known as [[Majene]], and a wide, sweeping search of the area revealed high amounts of scattered debris there, too.

===Cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder===
&lt;!-- This section only deals with the location of the CVR and FDR. Nobody except the media calls these black boxes. If you wish to add info about their recovery, please see the 'Salvage' section below. --&gt;
On 21 January 2007, the [[flight data recorder]] (FDR) and [[cockpit voice recorder]] (CVR), popularly known as [[Flight recorder|black boxes]], were located 42 nautical miles off the coast of [[West Sulawesi]] by the US vessel ''[[USNS Mary Sears (T-AGS-65)|Mary Sears]]''.&lt;ref name="news.navy.mil" /&gt; The flight data recorder was located at {{coord|03|41|02|S|118|08|53|E}} at a depth of {{convert|2000|m|abbr=on}}, while the cockpit voice recorder was located at {{coord|03|40|22|S|118|09|16|E}} at a depth of {{convert|1900|m|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name="bernama27 January" /&gt; approximately {{convert|1.4|km|mi|abbr=on}} apart. The Indonesian vessel ''Fatahillah'' travelled to the location.&lt;ref name="news.navy.mil" /&gt; The ''Mary Sears'' used its [[side scan sonar]] (SSS) unit to map an area of approximately 10.3&amp;nbsp;km² (3 [[square nautical mile|sq nmi]]) around the recorders in high resolution, an operation which required 18 passes across the area at approximately {{convert|3|kn|km/h|0}}, taking six hours per pass including lining up for the next pass. It discovered a large amount of wreckage in the area, which was considered to be all that remained of the aircraft.&lt;ref name="news.navy.mil" /&gt; A senior Indonesian marine official said on 24 January that he did not believe that the equipment required to retrieve the boxes from that depth was available in any Asian country.&lt;ref name="bernama.com" /&gt; The black boxes had a battery life of just 30 days, and would subsequently be unable to emit locator signals.&lt;ref name="AirWiseNews" /&gt;

On 3 February, Indonesian naval vessel [[KRI Tanjung Dalpele|KRI ''Tanjung Dalpele'']] took affected families out to the crash site where a memorial service was held, which included throwing flowers into the sea.&lt;ref name="memorial service" /&gt;

On 26 January 2007, a dispute arose between Adam Air and the Indonesian government regarding the retrieval of the black boxes. Due to the depth involved, recovery required an underwater [[remotely operated vehicle]], but Indonesia did not have such equipment. Vice-President of Indonesia [[Jusuf Kalla]] went as far as to question the need to retrieve the black boxes at all, although experts said in response that the accident was of international significance as it could indicate a fault with the aircraft.&lt;ref name=iht /&gt; Adam Air said that in its opinion, the black boxes should be recovered, describing the accident as being relevant on both national and international levels, but refused to pay, saying that was the responsibility of the government.&lt;ref name="AA-government dispute" /&gt; Indonesia did request technical assistance from the United States, Japan and France.&lt;ref name="the United States, Japan and France in talks" /&gt; [[Jim Hall (NTSB Chairman)|Jim Hall]], a former chairman of the US [[National Transportation Safety Board]], said that it was essential the boxes be recovered quickly, as at that point their 30-day battery life was about to expire, which subsequently did happen. He cited problems such as poor visibility and strong currents making it difficult to recover the devices without the signal.&lt;ref name=iht /&gt;

On 31 January it was reported that the US had to withdraw the vessel ''Mary Sears'' from the searches, the US military saying that the vessel had other duties. Further funding and help from the US would have to be approved by the United States Congress. At the same time, external companies were suggested as possible retrievers of the black boxes. Indonesia continued to seek help from other countries, such as France and Japan. Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee head Setio Rahardjo maintained that Adam Air should be charged with the retrieval costs.&lt;ref name="withdrawal of US help" /&gt;

It was originally confirmed that Indonesia would not pay for the salvage operation, and neither could they force Adam Air to do so.&lt;ref name="Flight Global" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Smit Internationale and Phoenix International" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Phoenix" /&gt; Nonetheless, Adam Air signed a contract with Phoenix International for the recovery operation.&lt;ref name="salvage-deal" /&gt; On 23 August, the ''Eas'' arrived in Sulawesi's Makassar port to begin salvage operations, which began with several days survey. The vessel was carrying a mini-submarine that could dive up to {{convert|6000|m|abbr=on}}, and was equipped with sonar and deep sea cameras.&lt;ref name="ShipHereIHT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ShipHereReuters" /&gt;

A Phoenix International underwater robot scouring the sea off Majene for on Sulawesi finally retrieved the flight data recorder on 27 August and cockpit voice recorder on 28 August. The two devices were found at a depth of around {{convert|2000|m|abbr=on}} and were {{convert|1400|m|abbr=on}} apart. They had been moved {{convert|10|–|15|m|abbr=on}} from their original locations by powerful underwater currents.&lt;ref name="Moved" /&gt; The black boxes were sent to [[Washington, D.C.]] for analysis.&lt;ref name="BlackboxRetrieved" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Retrieved /&gt; The final cost of the salvage operation to retrieve the black boxes was US$3 million,&lt;ref name="3 million dollars" /&gt; of which two million was contributed by the Indonesian government, with Adam Air paying the rest.&lt;ref name="cost-splitting" /&gt; Efforts continued with the hope of recovering various large pieces of wreckage from the seabed.&lt;ref name="Wreckage recovery" /&gt;

==Investigation==
President [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]] ordered a full investigation to discover the cause of the aircraft's disappearance, including the cause of any accident it may have had, before the main debris field had even been found. The investigation also looked at the airworthiness of the plane and standard procedure on aircraft operations.&lt;ref name=etravelblackboard /&gt; A team from the United States with representatives from the [[National Transportation Safety Board]], the [[Federal Aviation Administration]], [[Boeing]] and [[General Electric]] were sent to Indonesia to assist the Indonesian National Committee for Transportation in the investigation.&lt;ref name=ft /&gt;&lt;ref name="USarrival" /&gt; A wider investigation into Indonesia's transport system as a whole was planned.{{update inline|reason=What was the outcome of this investigation?|date=August 2018}} Eyewitnesses reported seeing a low-flying, unstable aircraft in the area from which the wreckage has been recovered but lost sight of it after hearing a loud bang. The chief of the [[Indonesian Plane Technicians group]], Wahyu Supriantono, said that the plane was unlikely to have suffered an in-flight break up or explosion, as the debris field would have been larger, and as a result, wreckage would have been discovered earlier.&lt;ref name=nobreakup /&gt; The flight recorders were recovered in August 2007, without which it would not have been possible to discover the cause of the accident.&lt;ref name=NTSC_final /&gt;{{rp|page=54}} The [[National Transportation Safety Committee]] (NTSC, or KNKT as per its Indonesian name) described the near eight-month wait for the recovery of the flight recorders as "unacceptable".&lt;ref name="Flight Global" /&gt;&lt;ref name=NTSC_final /&gt;{{rp|page=54}}

On 25 March 2008, the inquiry ruled that pilot error and a faulty navigation device were to blame.&lt;ref name=flight080325 /&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc080325 /&gt;

The NTSC determined that:
# Flight crew coordination was less than effective, as the PIC did not manage task sharing and crew resource management practices were not followed.
# The crew focused their attention on troubleshooting the Inertial Reference System (IRS) failure and neither pilot was flying the aircraft.
# After the autopilot disengaged and the aircraft exceeded 30 degrees right bank, the pilots appeared to have become spatially disoriented.
# The Adam Air syllabus of pilot training did not cover complete or partial IRS failure.
# The pilots had not received training in [[aircraft upset]] recovery, including spatial disorientation.&lt;ref name=NTSC_final&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atsb.gov.au/publications/investigation_reports/2008/AAIR/pdf/Final_AdamAir_PK_KKW_17032008.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-11-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923180956/http://www.atsb.gov.au/publications/investigation_reports/2008/AAIR/pdf/Final_AdamAir_PK_KKW_17032008.pdf |archivedate=23 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maintenance concerns===
Investigators quickly became concerned about apparent poor maintenance and believed it might have been an important factor in the accident.

====Adam Air as a whole====
{{Main|Adam Air}}
Adam Air's safety record, like that of a number of other Indonesian airlines, has been heavily criticized. Adam Air has reportedly bullied pilots to fly planes they knew were unsafe.&lt;ref name=controversy/&gt; Pilots have reported repeated and deliberate breaches of international safety regulations, and aircraft being flown in non-airworthy states (including one aircraft flying with a damaged door handle and another with a damaged window) for months. Other incidents include pilots being ordered to fly aircraft even after exceeding the take-off limit of five times per pilot per day, using spare parts from other planes to keep planes in the air, and ignoring requests not to take off due to unsafe aircraft. According to the [[Associated Press]], one ex-Adam Air pilot stated that "every time you flew, you had to fight with the ground staff and the management about all the regulations you had to violate." Pilots also claimed that if they confronted their seniors, they were grounded or docked pay.&lt;ref name=controversy/&gt;&lt;ref name="safety concerns"/&gt;

Founder Adam Adhitya Suherman had personally denied the accusations, stating that maintenance had made up "40 percent of our total operational costs".&lt;ref name="Adam'sresponse"/&gt;

====Specific aircraft====
Investigators discovered that the aircraft was the subject of a large number of complaints by pilots (called "write-ups" in the aviation industry). The highest number of complaints concerned the captain's side [[vertical speed indicator]], which informs the air crew of the rate (in feet per minute) at which the aircraft is ascending or descending. In all, 48 complaints were made regarding the instrument in the three months before the crash.&lt;ref name=complaints /&gt; The aircraft's [[inertial navigation system]], which informs pilots what direction the aircraft is turning in, was complained about a total of thirty times.&lt;ref name=complaints /&gt; The ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'' reported that this may be of particular significance.&lt;ref name=complaints /&gt; The third most-complained about instrument was a fuel differential light, which received fifteen write-ups.&lt;ref name=complaints /&gt; Numerous complaints were also received about inoperative cockpit instrument lights, as well as multiple other malfunctions.&lt;ref name=complaints /&gt; Several complaints were made that the [[Flap (aeronautics)|flaps]], which modify drag and lift during take-off and landing, were jamming at twenty-five degrees upon landing, and there were two complaints that the [[weather radar]] was faulty.&lt;ref name=complaints /&gt;

==Legal action==
Adam Air is being sued by Indonesian consumer and labour groups over the accident, for a total of one trillion rupiahs (US$100 million), to be paid to the families of the victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/indonesian-airline-hit-with-lawsuit-over-crash/story-e6frg6so-1111112807421|title=Indonesian airline hit with lawsuit over crash|newspaper=[[The Australian]]|date=10 January 2007|access-date=27 January 2007|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811152533/http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/indonesian-airline-hit-with-lawsuit-over-crash/story-e6frg6so-1111112807421|archivedate=11 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a lawyer for the families, speaking in a press conference along with the secretary for the Adam Air KI-574 Passengers' Families Association (formed in the aftermath of the disaster), 30 of the victims' families intend to sue Boeing instead of Adam Air over the accident. However, this does not necessarily mean that all of the others will sue Adam Air, as they may not necessarily exercise their right to sue at all.&lt;ref name="Boeingsued" /&gt;&lt;ref name="30 families" /&gt; Representatives of the families have explained that they believe the plane was brought down by a [[Boeing 737 rudder issues|faulty rudder control valve]], similar to the accidents involving [[United Airlines Flight 585]] and [[USAir Flight 427]], which went down in the early 1990s, although there is no evidence that proves this. They have explained that, as a result, they are suing Boeing and [[Parker Hannifin]], the valve's manufacturer, although airlines using the [[Boeing 737 Classic|737-300, -400, and -500]] have been warned about problems with the rudder control valves.{{update inline|What became of these legal cases?|date=August 2018}}

==Reaction==

===Government===
Vice-President Jusuf Kalla described the disappearance as an "international issue."&lt;ref name=vpreaction /&gt; A few days after the disappearance, President [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]] set up the [[National Team for Transportation Safety and Security]], partially as a response to the high number of recent transportation accidents in Indonesia, and partially as a direct response to the event.&lt;ref name="NTTSS" /&gt; The team was tasked to evaluate thoroughly the transport safety procedures and review the existing regulations on transportation.&lt;ref name="NTTSS" /&gt; It was not, however, to investigate accidents; the entity deemed responsible for this was the Komisi Nasional Keselamatan Transportasi (KNKT), or in English the National Transportation Safety Commission (NTSC), which is part of Departemen Perhubungan (Ministry of Transportation).&lt;ref name="NTSC" /&gt;

===Adam Air===
Adam Air has been accused by multiple organisations{{which|date=August 2018}} of poor maintenance, and of ordering pilots to fly in all weather and regardless of aircraft conditions. Adam Adhitya Suherman, founder of the family-run airline, has personally denied these accusations, and has said that maintenance consumes "up 40 percent of our total operational costs".&lt;ref name="Adam'sresponse" /&gt; 
Adam Air has compensated the families of deceased passengers Rp 500 million (equivalent to about US$55,000 or €42,000) per passenger. It also compensated families of the flight crew.&lt;ref name=costs /&gt;&lt;ref name="US$55,000 (€42,000)"&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/01/23/asia/AS-GEN-Indonesia-Plane-Crash.php Indonesian airline to give US$55,000 to relatives of crash victims] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080618065256/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/01/23/asia/AS-GEN-Indonesia-Plane-Crash.php |date=18 June 2008 }} ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'' (Asia-Pacific section) – Retrieved 24 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been some calls from relatives of the dead for Adam Air to build a memorial to the victims in [[Makassar]], South Sulawesi. Adam Air said that if an agreement could be reached, then they would fulfill the request.&lt;ref name="memorial request" /&gt;

==Aftermath==
Shortly after the crash, Adam Air changed the number of the regular Surabaya–Manado flight from Flight 574 to Flight 582. This accident also weakened Adam Air's image, which at the time was already negative among the public because of their frequent breakdowns and delays. The crash also exacerbated financial difficulties at the airline, which ceased operations a few years later.

The [[Government of Indonesia|Indonesian government]] announced plans immediately after the accident to ban jets over ten years old for any commercial purpose.&lt;ref name="banned jets" /&gt;{{update inline|reason=Was this plan enacted?|date=August 2018}} Previously the age limit was 35 years or 70,000 landings.&lt;ref name="35 years or 70,000 landings" /&gt; Although this was in response to a large number of aircraft accidents, it was mainly in response to this accident and the [[Adam Air Flight 172|Flight 172]] incident. Indonesia also announced that the Transportation Ministry would be reshuffled in response to this accident, Flight 172 and the loss of the ferries [[MV Senopati Nusantara|MV ''Senopati Nusantara'']] and ''[[Levina 1]]''. Among those replaced were the directors of air and sea transports and the chairman of the National Committee for Transportation Safety.&lt;ref name=reshuffle /&gt; Indonesia also introduced a new system of ranking airlines according to their safety record, with a level one ranking meaning the airline has no serious issues, a level two ranking meaning the airline must fix problems, and a level three ranking which may force the airline to shut down.&lt;ref name="SeattlePi" /&gt;

In March 2007, the Indonesian government announced that Adam Air was one of fifteen airlines that would have their licences revoked within three months unless they could improve their safety standards.&lt;ref name=shutdown /&gt;&lt;ref name="three months" /&gt; The other airlines included [[Batavia Air]], [[Jatayu Airlines]], [[Kartika Airlines]], [[Manunggal Air Services]], [[Transwisata Prima Aviation]] and [[Tri-MG Intra Asia Airlines]].&lt;ref name="three months" /&gt; These airlines were all targeted as a direct result of the crash, as they were in the third level of the ranking system introduced as a result.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} All Indonesian airlines, including state-owned [[Garuda Indonesia]], were told they would need to make some improvements, with none of them receiving a level one ranking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bruneitimes.com.bn/classification/frontpage/2007/03/24/all_54_indonesian_airlines_told_to_raise_safety_standards|title=All 54 Indonesian airlines told to raise safety standards|newspaper=[[The Brunei Times]]|date=24 March 2007|access-date=24 March 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222055449/http://www.bruneitimes.com.bn/classification/frontpage/2007/03/24/all_54_indonesian_airlines_told_to_raise_safety_standards|archivedate=22 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported on 28 June 2007, that Adam Air would escape closure and had been upgraded one rank in safety rating, to the middle tier. The airlines that lost their licences were Jatayu Gelang Sejahtera, Aviasi Upataraksa, Alfa Trans Dirgantara, and Prodexim. Additionally, Germania Trisila Air, Atlas Delta Setia, Survey Udara Penas, Kura-Kura Aviation and Sabang Merauke Raya Air Charter were grounded pending improvements and facing potential licence revocation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/06/26/1962748.htm?section=justin Safety concerns ground 9 Indonesian airlines] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071208214833/http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/06/26/1962748.htm?section=justin |date=8 December 2007 }} – [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] – 26 June 2007 – Retrieved 28 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 April 2007, the American [[Federal Aviation Administration]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa/ FAA IASA Program] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150102055807/http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa/ |date=2 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; responded to the results of the new airline survey by downgrading Indonesia's air safety oversight category from a 1 to a 2 because of "serious concerns" over safety. This means it views Indonesia's civil aviation authority as failing to oversee air carriers in accordance with minimum international standards.&lt;ref name=downgrade /&gt; As a direct result, the US Embassy in [[Jakarta]] issued a warning to all American citizens flying in or out of Indonesia to avoid using Indonesian airlines, and instead use international carriers with better safety reputations.&lt;ref name="NoFlyIndon" /&gt; This was followed on 28 June 2007 by the addition of all Indonesia's airlines, none of which flew to Europe at the time, to the [[List of air carriers banned in the EU]]; the ban was lifted for flag carrier Garuda Indonesia and three smaller airlines in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8150352.stm|title=EU lifts Indonesian airline ban|work=BBC|date=14 July 2009|access-date=15 August 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by 2018 all Indonesian airlines were once again permitted to fly to the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://flightsafety.org/eu-lifts-ban-on-flights-by-indonesian-airlines/|title=EU Lifts Ban on Flights by Indonesian Airlines|work=Flight Safety Foundation|date=14 June 2018|access-date=15 August 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Budhi Mulyawan Suyitno, Director-general of civil aviation at the Indonesian transport ministry, responded by saying that he felt Indonesia had made the improvements required by the EU.&lt;ref name=Blacklisted /&gt;&lt;ref name=Blacklisted2 /&gt; A blanket ban on all Indonesian airlines flying to the United States was imposed in 2007, and lifted in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-08-15/indonesia-airlines-cleared-to-fly-to-us/7736642|title=Indonesia airlines cleared to fly to United States|work=ABC News|date=15 August 2009|access-date=15 August 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 March 2008, just a day after an [[Adam Air#Flight 292|accident in Batam]], the airline's Air Operator's Certificate was suspended by the Indonesian government. Three months later in June of the same year, the certificate was revoked, and the airline filed for bankruptcy.

===Flight 172===
{{main|Adam Air Flight 172}}
On 21 February 2007, just 51 days after the loss of Flight 574, [[Adam Air Flight 172|Flight 172]], an Adam Air [[Boeing 737|Boeing 737-300]] aircraft (registration PK-KKV) flying from [[Jakarta]] to [[Surabaya]] had a hard landing at [[Juanda International Airport]]. The incident caused the fuselage of the plane to crack and bend in the middle, with the tail of the plane drooping towards the ground. There were no reports of serious injuries from the incident. As a result, six Adam Air 737s were grounded awaiting safety checks. Adam Air described this as "harsh punishment" for an accident it blamed on poor weather conditions, but Vice-President Kalla had said that all Boeing 737-300s should be checked.&lt;ref name="Flight 172" /&gt;

===Alleged cockpit voice recording leakage===
In early August 2008, a five-minute-38-second digital recording allegedly retrieved from the plane's [[cockpit voice recorder]] was widely circulated on the Internet and transcribed by the media.&lt;ref name="Okezone: Rekaman Kotak Hitam Pesawat Adam Air" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/08/02/ri-may-be-breach-icao-regulation-over-quotadam-airquot-recording.html|title=RI may be in breach of ICAO regulation over 'Adam Air' recording|work=The Jakarta Post|access-date=28 October 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070104065237/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/08/02/ri-may-be-breach-icao-regulation-over-quotadam-airquot-recording.html|archivedate=4 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The recording, which had been publicly distributed through chain e-mails, begins with what is believed by some to be a conversation between pilot Refi Agustian Widodo and copilot Yoga Susanto before the crash. Approximately two minutes before the end of the recording, the autopilot disconnect horn sounded, followed approximately a minute later by "bank angle" warnings from the GPWS and the altitude alerter. Immediately thereafter, as the aircraft began its final dive, the shotgun-like sounds of engine compressor surges and the overspeed "clacker" could be heard along with two background voices screaming in terror, and shouting out the [[Allahuakbar|name of God]]. Towards the end of the recording, there is a dramatic increase in windshield noise and two loud bangs (the second larger than the first), consistent with structural failure of the aircraft, followed 20 seconds later by an abrupt silence. It is likely that, when the pilots regained visual ground contact, they quickly pulled up, overloading the horizontal stabiliser downwards and a main wing spar upwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.detiknews.com/read/2008/08/04/100801/982445/10/pengamat-rekaman-adamair-dari-cockpit-bukan-dari-atc|author=Nograhany Widhi K|title=Detikcom: Rekaman Adam Air Dari Cockpit Bukan ATC|date=8 April 2008|access-date=4 February 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211133907/http://www.detiknews.com/read/2008/08/04/100801/982445/10/pengamat-rekaman-adamair-dari-cockpit-bukan-dari-atc|archivedate=11 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was dismissed by officials who said that it was not authentic and was not the original recording.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/08/04/adam-air-recording-039not-original039.html|title=Adam Air recording 'not original'|work=The Jakarta Post|date=4 August 2008|access-date=4 February 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140225114224/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/08/04/adam-air-recording-039not-original039.html|archivedate=25 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Adam Johann Ritter&lt;ref&gt;{{German title Ritter}}&lt;/ref&gt;''' (later Freiherr&lt;ref&gt;{{German title Freiherr}}&lt;/ref&gt;) '''von Krusenstern''' ({{lang-ru|Ива́н Фёдорович Крузенште́рн}}, [[Romanization of Russian|tr.]] {{transl|ru|Ivan Fyodorovich Kruzenshtern}}; 10 October 1770{{snd}}12 August 1846) was a  [[Russian Admiral| Russian admiral]] and [[List of Russian explorers|explorer]], who led the [[first Russian circumnavigation]] of the [[Earth|globe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Adam Johann von Krusenstern |title=Voyage Round the World |date=1813 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kGxJAAAAYAAJ }}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Oh4RAQAAIAAJ vol. II], translated from German into English by Richard Belgrave Hoppner&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
[[File:Weitsch Adam Johann von Krusenstern in Avacha Bay.jpg|thumb|''Adam Johann von Krusenstern in [[Avacha Bay]]'' by [[Friedrich Georg Weitsch]], c. 1806, [[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum]] in [[Warsaw]]]]

Krusenstern was born in [[Hagudi]], [[Harju County|Harrien]], [[Governorate of Estonia]], [[Russian Empire]] into a [[Baltic German]] family descended from the [[Swedish Empire|Swedish]] aristocratic family von Krusenstjerna, who remained in the province after the country was ceded to Russia. In 1787, he joined the [[Russian Imperial Navy]], and served in the war against Sweden. Subsequently, he served in the [[Royal Navy]] between 1793 and 1799, visiting America, India and China.&lt;ref name="eb1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Krusenstern, Adam Ivan|volume=15|page=934}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After publishing a paper pointing out the advantages of direct communication by sea between Russia and [[China]] by passing [[Cape Horn]] at the southern tip of [[South America]] and the [[Cape of Good Hope]] at the tip of [[South Africa]], he was appointed by Tsar [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] to make a voyage to the Far East coast of Asia to endeavour to carry out the project.&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt; Under the patronage of Alexander, Count [[Nikolay Petrovich Rumyantsev]] and the [[Russian-American Company]], Krusenstern led [[the first Russian circumnavigation]] of the world. The chief object of this undertaking was the development of the fur trade with [[Russian America]] ([[Alaska]]).&lt;ref name=nie&gt;{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Krusenstern, Adam Johann von|year=1905}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other goals of the two-ship expedition were to establish trade with [[China]] and [[Japan]], facilitate trade in [[South America]], and examine the coast of [[California]] in western [[North America]] for a possible colony.

The two ships, ''[[Nadezhda (1802 Russian ship)|Nadezhda]]'' (Hope, formerly the British merchant ''Leander'') under the command of Krusenstern, and ''[[Russian warship Neva|Neva]]'' (formerly the British merchant ''Thames'') under the command of Captain-Lieutenant [[Yuri F. Lisianski]], set sail from [[Kronstadt, Russia|Kronstadt]] in August 1803, rounded [[Cape Horn]] of [[South America]], reached the northern [[Pacific Ocean]], and returned via the [[Cape of Good Hope]] at [[South Africa]]. Krusenstern arrived back at Kronstadt in August 1806.&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt; Both [[Sea explorer|seafarers]] made maps and detailed recordings of their voyages.

Upon his return, Krusenstern wrote a detailed report, ''"Reise um die Welt in den Jahren 1803, 1804, 1805 und 1806 auf Befehl Seiner Kaiserlichen Majestät Alexanders des Ersten auf den Schiffen Nadeschda und Newa"'' ("Journey around the World in the Years 1803, 1804, 1805, and 1806 at the Command of his Imperial Majesty Alexander I in the Ships Nadezhda and Neva") published in [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1810. It was published in 1811–1812 in [[Berlin]]; this was followed by an English translation, published in [[London]] in 1813 and subsequently by French, Dutch, Danish, Swedish, and Italian translations. His scientific work, which includes an atlas of the Pacific, was published in 1827 in [[Saint Petersburg]].

The geographical discoveries of Krusenstern made his voyage very important for the progress of geographical science.&lt;ref name=nie/&gt; His work won him an honorary membership in the [[Russian Academy of Science]]s. In 1816, he was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].

As director of the Russian naval school Krusenstern did much useful work. He was also a member of the scientific committee of the marine department, and his contrivance for counteracting the influence of the iron in vessels on the compass was adopted in the navy.&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt; Krusenstern became an admiral in 1841&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Appletons'|wstitle=Krusenstern, Adam Johann von|year=1900}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he was awarded the [[Pour le Mérite]] (civil class) in 1842. He died in 1846 in [[Kiltsi Manor|Kiltsi manor]], an Estonian manor he had purchased in 1816, and was buried in the [[Tallinn Cathedral]].

== Legacy ==
{{see also|Krusenstern (disambiguation)}}

The Russian [[training ship|training]] [[tall ship]] ''[[Kruzenshtern (ship)|Kruzenshtern]]'' is named after him. To commemorate the 200th anniversary of Krusenstern's circumnavigation, the ship retraced his route around the globe in 2005–2006.

Another ship named after him is the Russian [[icebreaker]] ''[[Ivan Kruzenshtern (icebreaker)|Ivan Kruzenshtern]]''.&lt;ref name="marinetraffic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marinetraffic.com/ais/shipdetails.aspx?mmsi=273124000&amp;header=true|title=Vessel details for: IVAN KRUZENSHTERN (Icebreaker) - IMO 6501496, MMSI 273124000, Call Sign UAMJ Registered in Russia &amp;#124; AIS Marine Traffic|website=marinetraffic.com|accessdate=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, an Aeroflot Airbus 320 [http://www.planespotters.net/Aviation_Photos/search.php?tag=VP-BKC VP-BKC]  is named after him.

The crater [[Krusenstern (crater)|Krusenstern]] on the [[Moon]] is named after him. There is [[Little Diomede Island|Krusenstern Island]] in the [[Bering Strait]], as well as a small group of islands in the [[Kara Sea]], southwest of the [[Nordenskiöld Archipelago]], called Krusenstern Islands. Cape Krusenstern in Northwest Alaska is the site of [[Cape Krusenstern National Monument]] (1978), one of the most important archaeological sites in the state.

In Russia (as well as in other [[Russophone]] places), a fictional [[steamship]] ''Admiral Ivan Fyodorovich Kruzenshtern'' from the popular ''[[Prostokvashino]]'' animated film series is well-known, often as part of a [[catchphrase]] "Admiral I.F. Kruzenshtern, a man and a steamship", "pirated" from the title of a requiem poem by [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]], ''To Comrade Nette, a Man and a Steamship''. As a third-level linguistic derivation, there is a Russophone [[Israel]] [[klezmer]]-rock band, [[Kruzenshtern &amp; Parohod]] ("Krusenstern and Steamship").

Another legacy is that the Cook Islands in the South Pacific bear that name thanks to von Krusenstern. Previously known as the Hervey (or Harvey) Islands (or Group), he changed their name in 1835 to honour Captain Cook. More accurately, he changed the name of those which comprised the Southern Group and it was subsequently applied to all 15 islands when the [[New Zealand Parliament]] passed "The Cook Islands and other Islands Government Act" in 1901. He recorded the new name in his "Atlas de l'Océan Pacifique" published at St. Petersburg between 1824 and 1835.&lt;ref&gt;Discoverers of the Cook Islands and the Names they Gave by Aphons M.J. Kloosterman – Cook Islands Library and Museum&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1586">In [[ecology]], '''autogenic succession''' is [[ecological succession|succession]] driven by the [[biotic component]]s of an [[ecosystem]].&lt;ref name="ORO" /&gt; In contrast, [[allogenic succession]] is driven by the [[abiotic component]]s of the ecosystem.&lt;ref name="ORO" /&gt;

== How it occurs ==
The plants themselves (biotic components) cause succession to occur.
* Light captured by leaves
*Production of detritus
*Water and nutrient uptake
*Nitrogen fixation
*anthropogenic climate change

These aspects lead to a gradual ecological change in a particular spot of land, known as a progression of inhabiting species. Autogenic succession can be viewed as a secondary succession because of pre-existing plant life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/ecopage/upland/oak/oak94/Proceedings/Platt1.gif|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020120925/https://www.epa.gov/ecopage/upland/oak/oak94/Proceedings/Platt1.gif|title=Archived copy|archivedate=20 October 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''blast shelter''' is a place where people can go to protect themselves from blasts and explosions, like those from [[bomb]]s, or in hazardous worksites, such as on oil and gas refineries or petrochemical facilities. It differs from a [[fallout shelter]], in that its main purpose is to protect from [[shock wave]]s and [[overpressure]] instead of from [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], as a fallout shelter does. It is also possible for a shelter to protect from both blasts and [[nuclear fallout|fallout]].

Blast shelters are a vital form of protection from [[nuclear attack]] and are employed in [[civil defense]]. There are above-ground, below-ground, dedicated, dual-purpose, and potential blast shelters. Dedicated blast shelters are built specifically for the purpose of blast protection (see [[bunker]]). Dual-purpose blast shelters are existing structures with blast-protective properties that have been modified to accommodate people seeking protection from blasts. Potential blast shelters are existing structures or geological features exhibiting blast-protective properties that have potential to be used for protection from blasts.

[[File:NORADBlast-Doors.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The 25-ton blast door in the [[Cheyenne Mountain nuclear bunker]] is the main entrance to another blast door (background) beyond which the side tunnel branches into access tunnels to the main chambers.]]
Blast shelters deflect the blast wave from nearby explosions to prevent ear and internal injuries to people sheltering in the bunker. While frame buildings collapse from as little as 3 [[pound-force per square inch|psi]] (20 [[kilopascal|kPa]]) of [[overpressure]], blast shelters are regularly constructed to survive several hundred psi. This substantially decreases the likelihood that a bomb can harm the structure.

The basic plan is to provide a structure that is very strong in compression. The actual strength specification must be done individually, based on the nature and probability of the threat. A typical specification for heavy civil defence shelter in Europe during the Cold war was an overhead explosion of a 500 kiloton weapon at the height of 500 meters. Such a weapon would be used to attack [[soft target]]s (factories, administrative centres, communications) in the area.

Only the most heavy bedrock-shelters would stand a chance of surviving. However, in the countryside or in a suburb, the likely distance to the explosion is much larger, as it is improbable that anyone would waste an expensive nuclear device on such targets. The most common purpose-built structure is a steel-reinforced concrete [[Vault (architecture)|vault]] or [[arch]] buried or located in the basement of a house.

Most expedient blast shelters are civil engineering structures that contain large buried tubes or pipes such as sewage or rapid transit tunnels. Even these, nonetheless, require several additions to serve properly: blast doors, air-filtration and ventilation equipment, secondary exits, and air-proofing.

Improvised purpose-built blast shelters normally use earthen arches or vaults. To form these, a narrow (1-2 metre-wide) flexible tent of thin wood is placed in a deep trench (usually the apex of the tent is below grade), and then covered with cloth or plastic, and then covered with 1–2 meters of tamped earth. Shelters of this type are approved field expedient blast shelters of both the U.S. and China. Entrances are constructed from thick wooden frames. Blast valves are to be constructed from tire-treads laid on thick wooden grids.

Nuclear bunkers must also cope with the underpressure that lasts for several seconds after the shock wave passes, and prompt radiation. The overburden and structure provide substantial [[radiation shielding]], and the negative pressure is usually only 1/3 of the overpressure.

The doors must be at least as strong as the walls. The usual design is a trap-door, to minimize the size and expense. In dual-purpose shelters, which have a secondary peace time use, the door may be normal. To reduce the weight, the door is normally constructed of steel, with a fitted steel lintel and frame welded to the steel-reinforcement of the concrete. The shelter should be located so that there is no combustible material directly outside it.

If the door is on the surface and will be exposed to the blast wave, the edge of the door is normally counter-sunk in the frame so that the blast wave or a reflection cannot lift the edge. If possible, this should be avoided, and the door built so that it is sheltered from the blast wave by other structures. The most useful construction is to build the door behind a 90°-turn in a corridor that has an exit for the overpressure.

[[File:Väestönsuojan ovi.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Door of a light civil defence shelter in Finland]]

A bunker commonly has two doors, one of which is convenient, and in peace time use, and the other is strong. Naturally, the shelter must always have a secondary exit which can be used if the primary door is blocked by debris. Door shafts may double as ventilation shafts to reduce the digging, although this is inadvisable.

A large ground shock can move the walls of a bunker several centimeters in a few milliseconds. Bunkers designed for large ground shocks must have sprung internal buildings, hammocks, or bean-bag chairs to protect inhabitants from the walls and floors. However, most civilian-built improvised shelters do not need these as their structure cannot stand a shock large enough to seriously damage the occupants.

Earth is an excellent insulator. In bunkers inhabited for prolonged periods, large amounts of ventilation or air-conditioning must be provided to prevent heat prostration. In bunkers designed for war-time use, manually operated ventilators must be provided because supplies of electricity or gas are unreliable. The simplest form of effective fan to cool a shelter is a wide, heavy frame with flaps that swings in the shelter's doorway and can be swung from hinges on the ceiling.

The flaps open in one direction and close in the other, pumping air. (This is a [[Kearny Air Pump]], or KAP, named after the inventor [[Cresson Kearny]].) Kearny asserts, based on field testing, that air filtration is not normally needed in a nuclear shelter.  He asserts that fallout is either large enough to fall to the ground, or so fine that it will not settle and thus has little bulk to emit radiation.  However, if possible, shelters should have air-filtration to stop chemical, biological and nuclear impurities which may abound after an explosion.

Ventilation openings in a bunker must be protected by blast valves. A [[blast valve]] is closed by a shock wave, but otherwise remains open. If the bunker is in a built-up area, it may include water-cooling or an [[immersion tube]] and breathing tubes to protect inhabitants from [[fire storm]]s. In these cases, the secondary exit is also most useful.

Bunkers must also protect the inhabitants from normal weather, including rain, summer heat and winter cold. A normal form of rainproofing is to place plastic film on the bunker's main structure before burying it. Thick (5-mil or 125&amp;nbsp;µm), inexpensive [[polyethylene]] film serves quite well, because the overburden protects it from degradation by wind and sunlight. Naturally, a buried or basement-situated reinforced-concrete shelter usually has the normal appearance of a building.

When a house is purpose-built with a blast shelter, the normal location is a reinforced below-grade bathroom with large cabinets. In apartment houses, the shelter may double as storage space, as long as it can be swiftly emptied for its primary use. A shelter can easily be added in a new basement construction by taking an existing corner and adding two poured walls and a ceiling.

Some vendors provide true blast shelters engineered to provide good protection to individual families at modest cost. One common design approach uses [[fiber-reinforced plastic]] shells. Compressive protection may be provided by inexpensive earth arching. The overburden is designed to shield from radiation. To prevent the shelter from floating to the surface in high groundwater, some designs have a skirt held-down with the overburden. A properly designed, properly installed home shelter does not become a sinkhole in the lawn. In [[Switzerland]], which requires shelters for private apartment blocks and large private houses, the lightest shelters are constructed of stainless steel.

[[File:Bose-Einstein Condensation.ogv|thumb|upright=1.5|Schematic Bose–Einstein condensation versus temperature and the energy diagram]]

A '''Bose–Einstein condensate''' ('''BEC''') is a [[state of matter]] of a dilute [[gas]] of [[boson]]s cooled to [[temperature]]s very close to [[absolute zero]] (-273.15°C). Under such conditions, a large fraction of bosons occupy the lowest [[quantum state]], at which point microscopic quantum phenomena, particularly wavefunction interference, become apparent [[Macroscopic quantum phenomena|macroscopically]]. A BEC is formed by cooling a gas of extremely low density, about one-hundred-thousandth the density of [[Atmosphere of Earth|normal air]], to ultra-low temperatures.

This state was first predicted, generally, in 1924–1925 by [[Satyendra Nath Bose]] and [[Albert Einstein]].

== History ==
[[File:Bose Einstein condensate.png|right|thumb|238px|Velocity-distribution data (3 views) for a gas of [[rubidium]] atoms, confirming the discovery of a new phase of matter, the Bose–Einstein condensate. {{nowrap|Left: just}} before the appearance of a Bose–Einstein condensate. {{nowrap|Center: just}} after the appearance of the condensate. {{nowrap|Right: after}} further evaporation, leaving a sample of nearly pure condensate.]]

[[Satyendra Nath Bose]] first sent a paper to Einstein on the [[quantum statistics]] of light quanta (now called [[photon]]s), in which he derived [[Planck's law|Planck's quantum radiation law]] without any reference to classical physics. Einstein was impressed, translated the paper himself from English to German and submitted it for Bose to the ''[[Zeitschrift für Physik]]'', which published it in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=S. N. Bose |year=1924 |title=Plancks Gesetz und Lichtquantenhypothese |journal=Zeitschrift für Physik |volume=26 |pages=178–181 |bibcode=1924ZPhy...26..178B |doi=10.1007/BF01327326}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (The Einstein manuscript, once believed to be lost, was found in a library at [[Leiden University]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lorentz.leidenuniv.nl/history/Einstein_archive/ |title=Leiden University Einstein archive |publisher=Lorentz.leidenuniv.nl |date=27 October 1920 |accessdate=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Einstein then extended Bose's ideas to matter in two other papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=A. Einstein |year=1925 |title=Quantentheorie des einatomigen idealen Gases |journal=Sitzungsberichte der Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften |volume=1 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ronald W. |last=Clark |title=Einstein: The Life and Times |publisher=Avon Books |year=1971 |pages=408–409 |isbn=0-380-01159-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; The result of their efforts is the concept of a [[Bose gas]], governed by [[Bose–Einstein statistics]], which describes the statistical distribution of [[identical particles]] with [[integer]] [[spin (physics)|spin]], now called [[boson]]s. Bosons, which include the photon as well as atoms such as [[helium-4]] (&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He), are allowed to share a quantum state. Einstein proposed that cooling bosonic atoms to a very low temperature would cause them to fall (or "condense") into the lowest accessible [[quantum state]], resulting in a new form of matter.

In 1938 [[Fritz London]] proposed BEC as a mechanism for [[superfluidity]] in &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He and [[superconductivity]].&lt;ref name=London:1938/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;London, F. ''Superfluids'' Vol.I and II, (reprinted New York: Dover 1964)&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 5, 1995 the first gaseous condensate was produced by [[Eric Allin Cornell|Eric Cornell]] and [[Carl Wieman]] at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]] [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]]–[[JILA]] lab, in a gas of [[rubidium]] atoms cooled to 170 [[kelvin|nanokelvins]] (nK).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2001/10/bose-einstein-condensate-new-form-matter ''Bose-Einstein Condensate: A New Form of Matter'', NIST], 9 October 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, [[Wolfgang Ketterle]] at [[MIT]] demonstrated important BEC properties. For their achievements Cornell, Wieman, and Ketterle received the 2001 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Levi | first = Barbara Goss | title = Cornell, Ketterle, and Wieman Share Nobel Prize for Bose–Einstein Condensates | work = Search &amp; Discovery | publisher = Physics Today online| year = 2001 | url = http://www.physicstoday.org/pt/vol-54/iss-12/p14.html | accessdate = 26 January 2008 |archiveurl =https://archive.is/20071024134547/http://www.physicstoday.org/pt/vol-54/iss-12/p14.html |archivedate = 24 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many isotopes were soon condensed, then molecules, quasi-particles, and photons in 2010.&lt;ref name=Klaers:2010/&gt;

== Critical temperature ==
This transition to BEC occurs below a critical temperature, which for a uniform [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] gas consisting of non-interacting particles with no apparent internal degrees of freedom is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;T_{\rm c}=\left(\frac{n}{\zeta(3/2)}\right)^{2/3}\frac{2\pi\hbar^2}{m k_{\rm B}} \approx 3.3125 \ \frac{\hbar^2 n^{2/3}}{m k_{\rm B}} &lt;/math&gt;

where:

&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;
{|cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\,T_{\rm c}&lt;/math&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;

|}
&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;/dl&gt;Interactions shift the value and the corrections can be calculated by mean-field theory.
This formula is derived from finding the gas degeneracy in the [[Bose gas]] using [[Bose–Einstein statistics]].

== Models ==

=== Bose Einstein's non-interacting gas ===
{{main|Bose gas}}
Consider a collection of ''N'' non-interacting particles, which can each be in one of two [[quantum state]]s, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle|0\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle|1\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. If the two states are equal in energy, each different configuration is equally likely.

If we can tell which particle is which, there are &lt;math&gt;2^N&lt;/math&gt; different configurations, since each particle can be in &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle|0\rangle&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle|1\rangle&lt;/math&gt; independently. In almost all of the configurations, about half the particles are in &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle|0\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and the other half in &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle|1\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. The balance is a statistical effect: the number of configurations is largest when the particles are divided equally.

If the particles are indistinguishable, however, there are only ''N''+1 different configurations. If there are ''K'' particles in state &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle|1\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, there are {{nowrap|''N − K''}} particles in state &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle|0\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. Whether any particular particle is in state &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle|0\rangle&lt;/math&gt; or in state &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle|1\rangle&lt;/math&gt; cannot be determined, so each value of ''K'' determines a unique quantum state for the whole system.

Suppose now that the energy of state &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle|1\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is slightly greater than the energy of state &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle|0\rangle&lt;/math&gt; by an amount ''E''. At temperature ''T'', a particle will have a lesser probability to be in state &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle|1\rangle&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;e^{-E/kT}&lt;/math&gt;. In the distinguishable case, the particle distribution will be biased slightly towards state &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle|0\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. But in the indistinguishable case, since there is no statistical pressure toward equal numbers, the most-likely outcome is that most of the particles will collapse into state &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle|0\rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

In the distinguishable case, for large ''N'', the fraction in state &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle|0\rangle&lt;/math&gt; can be computed. It is the same as flipping a coin with probability proportional to ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;exp(−''E''/''T'') to land tails.

In the indistinguishable case, each value of ''K'' is a single state, which has its own separate Boltzmann probability. So the probability distribution is exponential:

:&lt;math&gt;\,
P(K)= C e^{-KE/T} = C p^K.
&lt;/math&gt;

For large ''N'', the normalization constant ''C'' is {{nowrap|(1 − ''p'')}}. The expected total number of particles not in the lowest energy state, in the limit that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle N\rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt;, is equal to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \sum_{n&gt;0} C n p^n=p/(1-p) &lt;/math&gt;. It does not grow when ''N'' is large; it just approaches a constant. This will be a negligible fraction of the total number of particles. So a collection of enough Bose particles in thermal equilibrium will mostly be in the ground state, with only a few in any excited state, no matter how small the energy difference.

Consider now a gas of particles, which can be in different momentum states labeled &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle|k\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. If the number of particles is less than the number of thermally accessible states, for high temperatures and low densities, the particles will all be in different states. In this limit, the gas is classical. As the density increases or the temperature decreases, the number of accessible states per particle becomes smaller, and at some point, more particles will be forced into a single state than the maximum allowed for that state by statistical weighting. From this point on, any extra particle added will go into the ground state.

To calculate the transition temperature at any density, integrate, over all momentum states, the expression for maximum number of excited particles, {{nowrap|''p''/(1 − ''p'')}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\,
 N = V \int {d^3k \over (2\pi)^3} {p(k)\over 1-p(k)} = V \int {d^3k \over (2\pi)^3} {1 \over e^{k^2\over 2mT}-1} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\,
p(k)= e^{-k^2\over 2mT}.
&lt;/math&gt;

When the integral is evaluated with factors of ''k''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; and ℏ restored by dimensional analysis, it gives the critical temperature formula of the preceding section. Therefore, this integral defines the critical temperature and particle number corresponding to the conditions of negligible [[chemical potential]].  In [[Bose–Einstein statistics]] distribution, ''μ'' is actually still nonzero for BECs; however, ''μ'' is less than the ground state energy. Except when specifically talking about the ground state, μ can be approximated for most energy or momentum states as&amp;nbsp;''μ''&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;0.

=== Bogoliubov theory for weakly interacting gas ===
[[Nikolay Bogolyubov|Nikolay Bogoliubov]] considered perturbations on the limit of dilute gas,&lt;ref name=Bogoliubov:1947/&gt; finding a finite pressure at zero temperature and positive chemical potential. This leads to corrections for the ground state. The Bogoliubov state has pressure (''T''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0): &lt;math&gt;P = g/2 n^2&lt;/math&gt;.

The original interacting system can be converted to a system of non-interacting particles with a dispersion law.

=== Gross–Pitaevskii equation ===
{{Main|Gross–Pitaevskii equation}}

In some simplest cases, the state of condensed particles can be described with a nonlinear Schrödinger equation, also known as Gross–Pitaevskii or Ginzburg–Landau equation. The validity of this approach is actually limited to the case of ultracold temperatures, which fits well for the most alkali atoms experiments.

This approach originates from the assumption that the state of the BEC can be described by the unique wavefunction of the condensate &lt;math&gt;\psi(\vec{r})&lt;/math&gt;. For a [[Schrödinger field|system of this nature]], &lt;math&gt;|\psi(\vec{r})|^2&lt;/math&gt; is interpreted as the particle density, so the total number of atoms is &lt;math&gt;N=\int d\vec{r}|\psi(\vec{r})|^2&lt;/math&gt;

Provided essentially all atoms are in the condensate (that is, have condensed to the ground state), and treating the bosons using [[mean field theory]], the energy (E) associated with the state &lt;math&gt;\psi(\vec{r})&lt;/math&gt; is:

:&lt;math&gt;E=\int
d\vec{r}\left[\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}|\nabla\psi(\vec{r})|^2+V(\vec{r})|\psi(\vec{r})|^2+\frac{1}{2}U_0|\psi(\vec{r})|^4\right]&lt;/math&gt;

Minimizing this energy with respect to infinitesimal variations in &lt;math&gt;\psi(\vec{r})&lt;/math&gt;, and holding the number of atoms constant, yields the Gross–Pitaevski equation (GPE) (also a non-linear [[Schrödinger equation]]):

:&lt;math&gt;i\hbar\frac{\partial \psi(\vec{r})}{\partial t} = \left(-\frac{\hbar^2\nabla^2}{2m}+V(\vec{r})+U_0|\psi(\vec{r})|^2\right)\psi(\vec{r})&lt;/math&gt;

where:

&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;
{|cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\,m&lt;/math&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;is the mass of the bosons,
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\,V(\vec{r})&lt;/math&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;is the external potential,
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\,U_0&lt;/math&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;is representative of the inter-particle interactions.
|}
&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;/dl&gt;

In the case of zero external potential, the dispersion law  of interacting Bose–Einstein-condensed particles is given by so-called Bogoliubov spectrum (for &lt;math&gt;\ T= 0&lt;/math&gt;):

:&lt;math&gt; {\omega _p} = \sqrt {\frac{{{p^2}}}{{2m}}\left( {\frac{{{p^2}}}{{2m}} + 2{U_0}{n_0}} \right)} &lt;/math&gt;

The Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) provides a relatively good description of the behavior of atomic BEC's. However, GPE does not take into account the temperature dependence of dynamical variables, and is therefore valid only for &lt;math&gt;\ T= 0&lt;/math&gt;.
It is not applicable, for example, for the condensates of excitons, magnons and photons, where the critical temperature is comparable to room temperature.

==Numerical Solution==

The Gross-Pitaevskii  equation is a partial differential equation in space and time variables. Usually it  does not have analytic solution and

==== Weaknesses of Gross–Pitaevskii model ====
The Gross–Pitaevskii model of BEC is a physical [[approximation]] valid for certain classes of BECs. By construction, the [[Gross–Pitaevskii equation|GPE]] uses the following simplifications: it assumes that interactions between condensate particles are of the contact two-body type and also neglects anomalous contributions to [[self-energy]].&lt;ref&gt;Beliaev, S. T. Zh. Eksp. Teor. Fiz. 34, 417–432 (1958) [Soviet Phys. JETP 7, 289 (1958)]; ibid. 34, 433–446 [Soviet Phys. JETP 7, 299 (1958)].&lt;/ref&gt; These assumptions are suitable mostly for the dilute three-dimensional condensates. If one relaxes any of these assumptions, the equation for the condensate [[wavefunction]] acquires the terms containing higher-order powers of the wavefunction. Moreover, for some physical systems the amount of such terms turns out to be infinite, therefore, the equation becomes essentially non-polynomial. The examples where this could happen are the Bose–Fermi composite condensates,&lt;ref name=Schick:1971/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kolomeisky:1992/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kolomeisky:2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chui:2004/&gt; effectively lower-dimensional condensates,&lt;ref&gt;

=== Other ===
However, it is clear that in a general case the behaviour of Bose–Einstein condensate can be described by coupled evolution equations for condensate density, superfluid velocity and distribution function of elementary excitations. This problem was in 1977 by Peletminskii et al. in microscopical approach. The Peletminskii equations are valid for any finite temperatures below the critical point. Years after, in 1985, Kirkpatrick and Dorfman obtained similar equations using another microscopical approach. The Peletminskii equations also reproduce Khalatnikov hydrodynamical equations for superfluid as a limiting case.

=== Superfluidity of BEC and Landau criterion ===
The phenomena of superfluidity of a Bose gas and superconductivity of a strongly-correlated Fermi gas (a gas of Cooper pairs) are tightly connected to Bose–Einstein condensation. Under corresponding conditions, below the temperature of phase transition, these phenomena were observed in [[helium-4]] and different classes of superconductors. In this sense, the superconductivity is often called the superfluidity of Fermi gas.  In the simplest form, the origin of superfluidity can be seen from the weakly interacting bosons model.

== Experimental observation ==

=== Superfluid He-4 ===

In 1938, [[Pyotr Leonidovich Kapitsa|Pyotr Kapitsa]], [[John F. Allen|John Allen]] and [[Don Misener]] discovered that [[helium-4]] became a new kind of fluid, now known as a [[superfluid]], at temperatures less than 2.17 K (the [[lambda point]]). Superfluid helium has many unusual properties, including zero [[viscosity]] (the ability to flow without dissipating energy) and the existence of [[quantum vortex|quantized vortices]]. It was quickly believed that the superfluidity was due to partial Bose–Einstein condensation of the liquid. In fact, many properties of superfluid helium also appear in gaseous condensates created by Cornell, Wieman and Ketterle (see below). [[Superfluid helium-4]] is a liquid rather than a gas, which means that the interactions between the atoms are relatively strong; the original theory of Bose–Einstein condensation must be heavily modified in order to describe it. Bose–Einstein condensation remains, however, fundamental to the superfluid properties of helium-4. Note that [[helium-3]], a [[fermion]], also enters a [[superfluid]] phase (at a much lower temperature) which can be explained by the formation of bosonic [[Cooper pairs]] of two atoms (see also [[fermionic condensate]]).

=== Gaseous ===

The first "pure" Bose–Einstein condensate was created by [[Eric Cornell]], [[Carl Wieman]], and co-workers at [[JILA]] on 5 June 1995. They cooled a dilute vapor of approximately two thousand [[rubidium|rubidium-87]] atoms to below 170 nK using a combination of [[laser cooling]] (a technique that won its inventors [[Steven Chu]], [[Claude Cohen-Tannoudji]], and [[William D. Phillips]] the 1997 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]) and [[magnetic evaporative cooling]].  About four months later, an independent effort led by [[Wolfgang Ketterle]] at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] condensed [[sodium|sodium-23]]. Ketterle's condensate had a hundred times more atoms, allowing important results such as the observation of [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] between two different condensates. Cornell, Wieman and Ketterle won the 2001 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for their achievements.&lt;ref name="nobel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2001/cornellwieman-lecture.pdf |title=Eric A. Cornell and Carl E. Wieman&amp;nbsp;— Nobel Lecture |format=PDF |publisher=nobelprize.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A group led by Randall Hulet at Rice University announced a condensate of [[lithium]] atoms only one month following the JILA work.&lt;ref name=Bradley:1995/&gt; Lithium has attractive interactions, causing the condensate to be unstable and collapse for all but a few atoms. Hulet's team subsequently showed the condensate could be stabilized by confinement quantum pressure for up to about 1000 atoms.  Various isotopes have since been condensed.

==== Velocity-distribution data graph ====

In the image accompanying this article, the velocity-distribution data indicates the formation of a Bose–Einstein condensate out of a gas of [[rubidium]] atoms. The false colors indicate the number of atoms at each velocity, with red being the fewest and white being the most. The areas appearing white and light blue are at the lowest velocities. The peak is not infinitely narrow because of the [[uncertainty principle|Heisenberg uncertainty principle]]: spatially confined atoms have a minimum width velocity distribution. This width is given by the curvature of the magnetic potential in the given direction. More tightly confined directions have bigger widths in the ballistic velocity distribution. This [[anisotropy]] of the peak on the right is a purely quantum-mechanical effect and does not exist in the thermal distribution on the left. This graph served as the cover design for the 1999 textbook ''Thermal Physics'' by Ralph Baierlein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=fqUU71spbZYC&amp;printsec=frontcover|title=Thermal Physics|author=Baierlein, Ralph |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999|isbn=0-521-65838-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Quasiparticles ===

{{Main|Bose–Einstein condensation of quasiparticles}}Bose–Einstein condensation also applies to [[quasiparticle]]s in solids. [[Magnon]]s, [[Excitons]], and [[Polaritons]] have integer spin which means they are [[bosons]] that can form condensates.

Magnons, electron spin waves, can be controlled by a magnetic field.  Densities from the limit of a dilute gas to a strongly interacting Bose liquid are possible. Magnetic ordering is the analog of superfluidity. In 1999 condensation was demonstrated in antiferromagnetic [[Thallium|Tl]][[Copper|Cu]][[Chlorine|Cl]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;ref name=Nikuni:1999/&gt; at temperatures as large as 14 K. The high transition temperature (relative to atomic gases) is due to the magnons small mass (near an electron) and greater achievable density. In 2006, condensation in a [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] yttrium-iron-garnet thin film was seen even at room temperature,&lt;ref name=Demokritov:2006/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-muenster.de/Physik.AP/Demokritov/en/Forschen/Forschungsschwerpunkte/mBECfnP.html ''Magnon Bose Einstein Condensation'' made simple]. Website of the "Westfählische Wilhelms Universität Münster" Prof.Demokritov. Retrieved 25 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; with optical pumping.

[[Exciton]]s, electron-hole pairs, were predicted to condense at low temperature and high density by Boer et al. in 1961. Bilayer system experiments first demonstrated condensation in 2003, by Hall voltage disappearance.  Fast optical exciton creation was used to form condensates in sub-kelvin Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O in 2005 on.

[[Bose–Einstein condensation of polaritons|Polariton condensation]] was firstly detected for [[exciton-polaritons]] in a quantum well microcavity kept at 5 K.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Bose–Einstein condensation of exciton polaritons|date = 28 September 2006|journal = Nature|accessdate = |doi = 10.1038/nature05131|pmid = 17006506|volume=443 |issue = 7110|pages=409–414|bibcode = 2006Natur.443..409K |author=Kasprzak J, Richard M, Kundermann S, Baas A, Jeambrun P, Keeling JM, Marchetti FM, Szymańska MH, André R, Staehli JL, Savona V, Littlewood PB, Deveaud B, Dang}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Peculiar properties ==

=== Vortices ===
{{refimprove section|date=September 2011}}
As in many other systems, [[Vortex|vortices]] can exist in BECs. These can be created, for example, by 'stirring' the condensate with lasers, or rotating the confining trap. The vortex created will be a [[quantum vortex]]. These phenomena are allowed for by the non-linear &lt;math&gt;|\psi(\vec{r})|^2&lt;/math&gt; term in the GPE.{{Disputed inline|Talk page section|date=April 2017|reason=I do not believe the non-linear term is necessary; vortices are a simple consequence of the continuity equation the condensate wavefunction satisfies, and this equation is the same without the interaction term because the interaction term is real.}} As the vortices must have quantized [[angular momentum]] the wavefunction may have the form &lt;math&gt;\psi(\vec{r})=\phi(\rho,z)e^{i\ell\theta}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\rho, z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; are as in the [[cylindrical coordinate system]], and &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; is the angular number.  This is particularly likely for an axially symmetric (for instance, harmonic) confining potential, which is commonly used.  The notion is easily generalized.  To determine &lt;math&gt;\phi(\rho,z)&lt;/math&gt;, the energy of &lt;math&gt;\psi(\vec{r})&lt;/math&gt; must be minimized, according to the constraint &lt;math&gt;\psi(\vec{r})=\phi(\rho,z)e^{i\ell\theta}&lt;/math&gt;. This is usually done computationally, however in a uniform medium the analytic form:

:&lt;math&gt;\phi=\frac{nx}{\sqrt{2+x^2}}&lt;/math&gt;, where:
{| cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\,n^2&lt;/math&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;
| density far from the vortex,
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\,x = \frac{\rho}{\ell\xi},&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\,\xi&lt;/math&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;
| healing length of the condensate.
|}demonstrates the correct behavior, and is a good approximation.

A singly charged vortex (&lt;math&gt;\ell=1&lt;/math&gt;) is in the ground state, with its energy &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_v&lt;/math&gt; given by

:&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_v=\pi n
\frac{\hbar^2}{m}\ln\left(1.464\frac{b}{\xi}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\,b&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;the farthest distance from the vortices considered.(To obtain an energy which is well defined it is necessary to include this boundary &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;.)

For multiply charged vortices (&lt;math&gt;\ell &gt;1&lt;/math&gt;) the energy is approximated by

:&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_v\approx \ell^2\pi n
\frac{\hbar^2}{m}\ln\left(\frac{b}{\xi}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

which is greater than that of &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; singly charged vortices, indicating that these multiply charged vortices are unstable to decay. Research has, however, indicated they are metastable states, so may have relatively long lifetimes.

Closely related to the creation of vortices in BECs is the generation of so-called dark [[soliton]]s in one-dimensional BECs. These topological objects feature a phase gradient across their nodal plane, which stabilizes their shape even in propagation and interaction. Although solitons carry no charge and are thus prone to decay, relatively long-lived dark solitons have been produced and studied extensively.&lt;ref name=Becker:2008/&gt;

=== Attractive interactions ===
Experiments led by Randall Hulet at Rice University from 1995 through 2000 showed that lithium condensates with attractive interactions could stably exist up to a critical atom number.  Quench cooling the gas, they observed the condensate to grow, then subsequently collapse as the attraction overwhelmed the zero-point energy of the confining potential, in a burst reminiscent of a supernova, with an explosion preceded by an implosion.

Further work on attractive condensates was performed in 2000 by the [[JILA]] team, of Cornell, Wieman and coworkers. Their instrumentation now had better control so they used naturally ''attracting'' atoms of rubidium-85 (having negative atom–atom [[scattering length]]). Through [[Feshbach resonance]] involving a sweep of the magnetic field causing spin flip collisions, they lowered the characteristic, discrete energies at which rubidium bonds, making their Rb-85 atoms repulsive and creating a stable condensate. The reversible flip from attraction to repulsion stems from quantum [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] among wave-like condensate atoms.

When the JILA team raised the magnetic field strength further, the condensate suddenly reverted to attraction, imploded and shrank beyond detection, then exploded, expelling about two-thirds of its 10,000 atoms. About half of the atoms in the condensate seemed to have disappeared from the experiment altogether, not seen in the cold remnant or expanding gas cloud.&lt;ref name=nobel/&gt; [[Carl Wieman]] explained that under current atomic theory this characteristic of Bose–Einstein condensate could not be explained because the energy state of an atom near absolute zero should not be enough to cause an implosion; however, subsequent mean field theories have been proposed to explain it. Most likely they formed molecules of two rubidium atoms;&lt;ref name=vanPutten:2010/&gt; energy gained by this bond imparts velocity sufficient to leave the trap without being detected.

The process of creation of molecular Bose condensate during the sweep of the magnetic field throughout the Feshbach resonance, as well as the reverse process, are described by the exactly solvable model that can explain many experimental observations.&lt;ref name='sun-16pra2'&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.94.033808|title=Landau-Zener extension of the Tavis-Cummings model: Structure of the solution|author1=C.

Nevertheless, they have proven useful in exploring a wide range of questions in fundamental physics, and the years since the initial discoveries by the JILA and MIT groups have seen an increase in experimental and theoretical activity. Examples include experiments that have demonstrated [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] between condensates due to [[wave–particle duality]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Gorlitz, Axel | url=http://cua.mit.edu/ketterle_group/Projects_1997/Interference/Interference_BEC.htm | title=Interference of Condensates (BEC@MIT) | publisher=Cua.mit.edu | accessdate=13 October 2009 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304092631/http://cua.mit.edu/ketterle_group/Projects_1997/Interference/Interference_BEC.htm | archivedate=4 March 2016 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the study of [[superfluidity]] and quantized [[vortex|vortices]], the creation of bright matter wave [[soliton]]s from Bose condensates confined to one dimension, and the [[slow light|slowing of light]] pulses to very low speeds using [[electromagnetically induced transparency]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Vortices in Bose–Einstein condensates are also currently the subject of [[analogue gravity]] research, studying the possibility of modeling [[black hole]]s and their related phenomena in such environments in the laboratory. Experimenters have also realized "[[optical lattice]]s", where the interference pattern from overlapping lasers provides a [[periodic potential]]. These have been used to explore the transition between a superfluid and a [[Mott insulator]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://qpt.physics.harvard.edu/qptsi.html | title=From Superfluid to Insulator: Bose–Einstein Condensate Undergoes a Quantum Phase Transition | publisher=Qpt.physics.harvard.edu | accessdate=13 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may be useful in studying Bose–Einstein condensation in fewer than three dimensions, for example the [[Tonks–Girardeau gas]].

Bose–Einstein condensates composed of a wide range of [[isotope]]s have been produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/print/2005/jun/01/ten-of-the-best-for-bec| title=Ten of the best for BEC | publisher=Physicsweb.org | date=1 June 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cooling [[fermion]]s to extremely low temperatures has created [[degenerate matter|degenerate]] gases, subject to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]. To exhibit Bose–Einstein condensation, the fermions must "pair up" to form bosonic compound particles (e.g. [[molecule]]s or [[BCS theory|Cooper pairs]]). The first [[molecule|molecular]] condensates were created in November 2003 by the groups of [[Rudolf Grimm]] at the [[University of Innsbruck]], [[Deborah S. Jin]] at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]] and [[Wolfgang Ketterle]] at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]. Jin quickly went on to create the first [[fermionic condensate]] composed of [[Cooper pair]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2004/jan/28/fermionic-condensate-makes-its-debut|title=Fermionic condensate makes its debut| publisher=Physicsweb.org | date=28 January 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Danish physicist [[Lene Hau]] led a team from [[Harvard University]] which [[Slow light|slowed a beam of light]] to about 17 meters per second,{{Clarify|date=January 2010|reason=group velocity and not actual velocity?}} using a superfluid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Cromie | first = William J. | title = Physicists Slow Speed of Light | publisher = The Harvard University Gazette | date = 18 February 1999 | url = http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1999/02.18/light.html | accessdate = 26 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hau and her associates have since made a group of condensate atoms recoil from a light pulse such that they recorded the light's phase and amplitude, recovered by a second nearby condensate, in what they term "slow-light-mediated atomic matter-wave amplification" using Bose–Einstein condensates: details are discussed in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''.&lt;ref name=Ginsberg:2007/&gt;

Another current research interest is the creation of Bose–Einstein condensates in microgravity in order to use its properties for high precision [[Atom interferometer|atom interferometry]].

===Dark matter===

P. Sikivie and Q. Yang showed that [[cold dark matter]] [[axions]] form a Bose-Einstein condensate by [[thermalisation]] because of gravitational self-interactions.&lt;ref&gt;P. Sikivie, Q. Yang; Phys. Rev. Lett.,103:111103; 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Axions have not yet been confirmed to exist. However the important search for them has been greatly enhanced with the completion of upgrades to the [[Axion Dark Matter Experiment]](ADMX) at the University of Washington in early 2018.

=== Isotopes ===
{{refimprove section|date=July 2010}}
The effect has mainly been observed on alkaline atoms which have nuclear properties particularly suitable for working with traps. As of 2012, using ultra-low temperatures of {{nowrap|10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; K}} or below, Bose–Einstein condensates had been obtained for a multitude of isotopes, mainly of [[alkali metal]], [[alkaline earth metal]],
and [[lanthanide]] atoms ([[lithium|&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Li]], [[sodium|&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;Na]], [[potassium|&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt;K]], [[potassium|&lt;sup&gt;41&lt;/sup&gt;K]], [[rubidium|&lt;sup&gt;85&lt;/sup&gt;Rb]], &lt;sup&gt;87&lt;/sup&gt;Rb, [[caesium|&lt;sup&gt;133&lt;/sup&gt;Cs]], [[chromium|&lt;sup&gt;52&lt;/sup&gt;Cr]], [[calcium|&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Ca]], [[strontium|&lt;sup&gt;84&lt;/sup&gt;Sr]], [[strontium|&lt;sup&gt;86&lt;/sup&gt;Sr]], [[strontium|&lt;sup&gt;88&lt;/sup&gt;Sr]],  [[ytterbium|&lt;sup&gt;174&lt;/sup&gt;Yb]], [[dysprosium|&lt;sup&gt;164&lt;/sup&gt;Dy]], and [[erbium|&lt;sup&gt;168&lt;/sup&gt;Er]]). Research was finally successful in hydrogen with the aid of the newly developed method of 'evaporative cooling'.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the superfluid state of [[Helium|&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He]] below {{nowrap|2.17 K}} is not a good example, because the interaction between the atoms is too strong. Only 8% of atoms are in the ground state near absolute zero, rather than the 100% of a true condensate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2001/advanced-physicsprize2001.pdf| title=Bose–Einstein Condensation in Alkali Gases | publisher=The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences | date=2001 | accessdate = 17 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[boson]]ic behavior of some of these alkaline gases appears odd at first sight, because their nuclei have half-integer total spin.  It arises from a subtle interplay of electronic and nuclear spins: at ultra-low temperatures and corresponding excitation energies, the half-integer total spin of the electronic shell and half-integer total spin of the nucleus are coupled by a very weak [[hyperfine coupling|hyperfine interaction]].  The total spin of the atom, arising from this coupling, is an integer lower value.  The chemistry of systems at room temperature is determined by the electronic properties, which is essentially fermionic, since room temperature thermal excitations have typical energies much higher than the hyperfine values.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6185">'''Broken-Backed War Theory''' is a form of conflict that could transpire after a [[Nuclear warfare|massive nuclear exchange]]. 
Assuming that following a nuclear exchange all the participants have not been utterly annihilated, there may arise a scenario unique to military strategy and theory, one in which all or some of the parties involved strive to continue fighting until the other side is decisively defeated.

{{War}} 

== Origin of the phrase ==
Broken-Backed War Theory was first formally elaborated on in the 1952 British ''[[White Paper|Defence White Paper]]'', to describe what would presumably happen after a [[Nuclear warfare|major nuclear exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Redford|first1=Duncan|last2=Grove|first2=Philip|title=The Royal Navy: A History Since 1900 (A History of the Royal Navy)|date=29 May 2014|publisher=I. B. Tauris|isbn=978-1780767826|page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=p6p_O-iTSm4C&amp;pg=PA269&amp;lpg=PA269&amp;ots=P7YE6SXN23&amp;focus=viewport&amp;dq=broken+backed+war&amp;output=html_text|title = Arms, Economics and British Strategy: From Dreadnoughts to Hydrogen Bombs|last = Peden|first = G. C.|date = 2007-02-08|publisher = Cambridge University Press|isbn = 9781139462921|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American "New Look Strategy of 1953/54" utterly rejected the notion of Broken-Backed war.  They dropped the term from the 1955 white paper, and the phrase has since faded from common usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zellen|first1=Barry Scott|title=State of Doom: Bernard Brodie, The Bomb, and the Birth of the Bipolar World|date=December 2011|publisher=Continuum|isbn=9781441161345|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commentary ==
Klaus Knorr purported, that in a broken-backed war scenario, only military weapons and vehicles on hand prior to the sustained hostilities would be of use, as the economic potential of both sides would be, at least in theory, utterly shattered.  
{{cquote|
Do current predictions on the nature of future warfare exhaust not
only all possible, but all likely, contingencies? It can be granted that
a long-drawn-out and massive war conducted with conventional, by
which I mean modernized but nonatomic, weapons, is so unlikely to
occur that it may be safely neglected as a contingency. There definitely
is no future for World War II. It can also be granted that, once unlimited
thermonuclear war has broken out, there is no economic war
potential to be mobilized for its conduct.''' Even a broken-backed war would have to be fought overwhelmingly, if not entirely, with munitions on hand at the start of the fighting.''' ~ '''Klaus Knorr'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2009224?sid=21105415387731&amp;uid=3739704&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;uid=2][https://digitalndulibrary.ndu.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=%2Ficafarchive&amp;CISOPTR=39960&amp;REC=4&amp;CISOBOX=broken+backed Klaus E.

[[Herman Kahn]] in his tome [[On Thermonuclear War]], has posited that a broken-backed war is implausible, because one side would likely absorb vastly more damage than its opposition. As he was writing in the late 1950s, when the nuclear arsenals of the [[Nuclear weapons and the Soviet Union|Soviet Union]] and the [[Nuclear weapons of the United States|United States]] numbered in the tens of thousands, the validity of this statement in the modern war can be called into question.
{{cquote|The "broken-back" war notion is obsolete not only because of the possibility of mutual devastation but even more because it is so very unlikely that the forces of both sides would become attrited in even roughly the same way. One side is likely to get a rather commanding advantage and exploit this lead to force the other side to choose between surrender and the physical destruction of its capability to continue.

The nuclear strategist [[Bernard Brodie (military strategist)|Bernard Brodie]] argued that this form of conflict may be impractical simply because it is almost impossible to plan for. His writings on the subject came before the advent of [[counterforce|Counter-force]] doctrine, and during a time of nuclear plenty, when it was safe to assume that a nuclear exchange would render a nation's industry useless.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rand.org/pubs/commercial_books/CB137-1.html Bernard Brodie, Strategy in the Missile Age]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/606443.pdf IMPLICATIONS OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN TOTAL WAR; Bernard Brodie, 1957]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/605006.pdf Nuclear Weapons and Changing Strategic Outlooks; Bernard Brodie, 1956]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Cold War]], Colonel Virgil Ney hypothesized that a nuclear exchange alone would not be enough to defeat the Soviet Union, and he argued for a modest construction of underground facilities and infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nHFCKmo2PH8C|title = One Nation Underground: The Fallout Shelter in American Culture|last = Rose|first = Kenneth D.|date = 2004-05-01|publisher = NYU Press|isbn = 9780814775233|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
In the novel, ''[[Final Blackout]]'' by [[L. Ron Hubbard]], the conflict between the survivors of London and the United States has been characterized as a Broken-Backed War by some critics.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

The table-top [[Role-playing game]] [[Twilight 2000]] released by [[Game Designers' Workshop]] in 1984 entails a Broken-Backed War; in the aftermath of a nuclear exchange in 1997, by 2000, [[Warsaw Pact]] and [[NATO]] forces are still fighting for a decisive victory in Europe and elsewhere with dwindling conventional arms and munitions.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

'''Chakib Khelil''' (born 8 August 1939) is an [[Algeria]]n political figure who served in the government of Algeria as Minister of Energy and Mines from 1999 to 2010.

==Early life and education==
Khelil was born on 8 August 1939 in Oujda, Morocco.&lt;ref name=op162&gt;{{cite web|title=162th Ordinary Meeting |url=http://www.opec.org/opec_web/static_files_project/media/downloads/press_room/PressBack.pdf |publisher=OPEC |accessdate=17 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702195547/http://www.opec.org/opec_web/static_files_project/media/downloads/press_room/PressBack.pdf |archivedate=July 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a bachelor and master degrees in mining and petroleum engineering  from [[Ohio State University]] in 1964 and 1965, respectively. He also obtained a doctorate in petroleum engineering from [[Texas A&amp;M University]] in 1968.&lt;ref name=op162/&gt;

==Career==
After working in the [[United States]] for a few years with Shell, Phillips Petroleum and D.R. McCord &amp; Associates, Khelil joined [[Sonatrach]] in 1971 as head of its reservoir engineering department while being president of Alcore, a joint venture between Corelaboratories and Sonatrach. Then he became technical adviser in the presidency of Algeria from 1973 to 1975. He was appointed president of the Valhyd Group (with Valhyd standing for valorisation hydrocarbures in French) in 1975-1978. Next he served as coordinator in the hydrocarbon vice presidency of Sonatrach.

In 1980 he joined the [[World Bank]], working on petroleum-related projects in Africa, Latin America and Asia; he retired from it as its petroleum adviser  in 1999, only to join President [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]]'s cabinet on 1 November 1999, becoming Minister for Energy and Mines on 26 December 1999.

In 2001, while a minister, he was also named president of Sonatrach, and he nominated and was succeeded by [[Mohamed Meziane]] in 2003.  He was also president of [[OPEC]] for the years 2001 and 2008, president of the African Energy Commission (AFREC) in 2001, president of the Association of African Oil Producing Countries (APPA) in 2004 and the Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF) in 2010.

The '''Chelyabinsk meteorite''' (Russian: '''Челябинск''' or '''Челябинский метеорит''') is the fragmented remains of the large [[Chelyabinsk meteor]] of 15 February 2013 which reached the ground after the meteor's passage through the [[atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]].  The descent of the meteor, visible as a brilliant [[superbolide]] in the morning sky, caused a series of [[shock wave]]s that shattered windows, damaged approximately 7,200 buildings and left 1,500 people injured.&lt;ref name="Zeit"&gt;{{cite news | title=Russische Wissenschaftler finden Teile des Meteoriten |trans-title=Russian scientists find parts of the meteorite | url=http://www.zeit.de/wissen/umwelt/2013-02/meteorit-wissenschaftler-fund | date=18 February 2013 | newspaper=Zeit | language=German | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420145301/http://www.zeit.de/wissen/umwelt/2013-02/meteorit-wissenschaftler-fund | archivedate=2013-04-20 | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RBTH-23513"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://rbth.ru/news/2013/03/05/meteorite-caused_emergency_situation_regime_over_in_chelyabinsk_region_23513.html | title=Meteorite-caused emergency situation regime over in Chelyabinsk region | work=Russia Beyond The Headlines | publisher=Rossiyskaya Gazeta | date=5 March 2013 | agency=[[Interfax]] | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting fragments were scattered over a wide area.

The largest fragment had a total mass of {{convert|654|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and was raised from the bottom of [[Lake Chebarkul]] on 16 October 2013.&lt;ref name="live_1381954601" /&gt;

== Naming ==

The meteor and meteorite are named after [[Chelyabinsk Oblast]], over which the meteor exploded.  An initial proposal was to name the meteorite after [[Lake Chebarkul]], where one of its major fragments impacted and made a 6-metre-wide hole in the frozen lake surface.&lt;ref name="bbc_24550941"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24550941 | work=BBC News | title=Meteorite pulled from Russian lake | publisher=BBC | date=16 October 2013 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016113749/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24550941 | archivedate=2013-10-16 | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Composition and classification ==

The meteorite has been classified as an LL5 [[ordinary chondrite]]. First estimates of its composition indicate about 10% of [[meteoric iron]], as well as [[olivine]] and [[sulfides]].&lt;ref name="Zeit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Standard1360681801881"&gt;{{cite news |title=Russische Wissenschafter fanden Fragmente des Meteoriten |trans-title=Russian scientists found fragments of the meteorite | url=http://derstandard.at/1360681801881/Russische-Wissenschafter-fanden-Fragmente-des-Meteoriten | date=18 February 2013 | newspaper=Standard | language=German | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623224730/http://derstandard.at/1360681801881/Russische-Wissenschafter-fanden-Fragmente-des-Meteoriten | archivedate=2013-06-23 | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysis of three fragments using [[Optical microscope|optical microscopy]], [[Electron microscope|electron microscopy]], [[Raman spectroscopy]], and [[Radiometric dating|isotopic composition]] techniques used to date Solar System objects, showed the isotopic clocks in the asteroids ([[rubidium]] and [[strontium]] ratios, [[argon]] isotope ratios) appear to have partially or totally reset in past collisions. The isotopic clock resets may result from thermal effects changing isotopic ratios, and changes to cosmic radiation exposure. The asteroid appears to have had eight major collisions, around 4.53, 4.45, 3.73, 2.81, and 1.46 billion years ago, then at 852, 312, and 27 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Chelyabinsk Meteor Played 4.5 Billion Years of Cosmic Pinball|url = http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/life-unbounded/chelyabinsk-meteor-played-4-5-billion-years-of-cosmic-pinball/|accessdate = 2015-10-01|first = Caleb A.|last = Scharf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mineralogy, petrology, chronology, and exposure history of the Chelyabinsk meteorite and parent body|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/maps.12511/abstract|journal = Meteoritics &amp; Planetary Science|date = 2015-09-01|issn = 1945-5100|pages = 1790–1819|doi = 10.1111/maps.12511|first = K.|last = Righter|first2 = P.|last2 = Abell|first3 = D.|last3 = Agresti|first4 = E.

== Meteorite ==

Scientists collected 53 samples nearby a 6-metre-wide hole in the ice of [[Lake Chebarkul]], thought to be the result of a single meteorite fragment [[Impact event|impact]].

In the aftermath of the superbolide air burst, a large number of small meteorite fragments fell on areas west of Chelyabinsk, including Deputatskoye, generally at [[terminal velocity]], about the speed of a piece of gravel dropped from a skyscraper.&lt;ref name="NYT-20130219" /&gt; Local residents and schoolchildren located and picked up some of the meteorites, many located in snowdrifts, by following a visible hole that had been left in the outer surface of the snow.

The '''RS-platform Chrysler minivans''' are a series of passenger [[minivan]]s marketed by [[Chrysler]] from model years 2001 to 2007, the fourth in six generations of [[Chrysler minivans]], which were heavily revised versions of the [[Chrysler minivans (NS)|NS minivans]]. Depending on the market, these vans were known as the '''Dodge Caravan''', '''Chrysler Town &amp; Country''' and the '''Chrysler Voyager'''. With the discontinuation of the [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]] brand, the [[Plymouth Voyager]] didn't return.

==Overview==
In development from February 1996 to December 1999, the Generation IV minivans were based on the [[Chrysler S platform|Chrysler RS platform]] and featured a larger body frame with modified headlights and taillights. Design work by Brandon Faurote was approved in January 1997 and reached production approval in October 1997. Unveiled at the 2000 [[North American International Auto Show]] (NAIAS) on Monday, January 10, 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DdJIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=PoIMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3634,6863785&amp;dq=2001+dodge+caravan&amp;hl=en |title=DaimlerChrysler Debuts minivans |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; the RS minivans were released for sale in August 2000. The release was part of a promotional tie-in with [[Nabisco]], which unveiled their new "[[Oreo|Mini Oreos]]" inside the van during the unveiling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-28159731_ITM |title=Article: New Mini Oreos Debut in New Mini Van |publisher=AccessMyLibrary |date=August 10, 2000 |accessdate=September 26, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530062823/http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-28159731_ITM |archivedate=May 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first vans rolled off the line at the [[Windsor Assembly]] Plant on July 24.

[[File:Chrysler_Voyager_front_20090206.jpg|thumb|left|European market Chrysler Voyager]]
The RS minivans were sold as the Dodge Caravan, Chrysler Voyager and Chrysler Town &amp; Country, in 4 door body styles. The Caravan was available in a long wheelbase model, called the Grand Caravan, while the Chrysler Voyager was a short wheelbase model with base levels of equipment and the Town &amp; Country was only available with a long wheelbase and was the highest end model. The U.S. and Canadian market Chrysler Voyager was originally intended to be a Plymouth, but became a Chrysler with the discontinuation of the Plymouth brand in 2000. This model was also exported, while the Town &amp; Country was exported as a high-level model of the Voyager. Export models had the platform designation RG.

Trim levels for the Caravan and Town &amp; Country were carried over from the previous generation, while the Voyager was only offered in a base model.&lt;ref name="consumerguideauto.com"&gt;[http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/2001-to-2004-chrysler-town-country.htm "2001-2004 Chrysler Town &amp; Country"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101020134650/http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/2001-to-2004-chrysler-town-country.htm |date=October 20, 2010 }}, retrieved on 2011–08–22.&lt;/ref&gt; The Caravan was available in Base, SE, Sport and ES trims, and the Town &amp; Country was available in LX, LXi and Limited. In addition to other detailed changes, remote operated sliding doors and rear hatch, which could be opened and closed at the push of a button, either inside the vehicle, or with the keyless entry fob, became options, as well as a new tri-zone climate control system and side seat mounted airbags. In 2002, the value-packed '''eL''' and '''eX''' models were added to the Town &amp; Country. These models were both value-priced versions of the LX and LXi, respectively, with popular option packages.&lt;ref name="edmunds.com"&gt;[http://www.edmunds.com/chrysler/town-and-country/2002/?sub=minivan "2002 Chrysler Town &amp; Country"], retrieved on 2011–08–22.&lt;/ref&gt; 2004 saw the addition of an unnamed base short-wheelbase model.

In 2003, the Chrysler Voyager was discontinued in the U.S., a short wheelbase Town &amp; Country became available, and the Caravan C/V and Grand Caravan C/V returned after having been discontinued in 1995. The C/V featured the option of deleted side windows (replaced by composite panels), optional rear seats, a cargo floor made of plastic material similar to pickup truck bedliners, rubber flooring in lieu of carpeting and normal hatch at the rear. Minor changes were made to the Grand Caravan ES including many of the features included in Option Group 29S becoming standard, the 17&amp;nbsp;inch Titan Chrome wheels no longer being an option replaced with standard 16&amp;nbsp;inch chrome wheels, and the disappearance of the AutoStick Transmission option. This year also saw the appearance of an optional factory-installed rear seat DVD system with single disc player mounted below the HVAC controls, and the addition of a SXT model. 2004 offered an exclusive one year only "Anniversary Edition" package to mark Caravan's 20th year in production. This package was offered on higher level SXT models, and included chrome wheels, body color moldings, special interior accents and a unique fender badge.

The 2005 minivans received a mid-cycle refresh including revised front fascias and a mildly restyled interior. This model introduced a system of second- and third-row seating that folded completely into under-floor compartments. It was marketed as ''Stow 'N Go'' and was available exclusively on long-wheelbase models. In a development program costing $400 million,&lt;ref name="ameinfo"&gt;{{cite web|title= Chrysler extends leadership in Mideast minivan segment with 'Stow 'n Go' |publisher =Ameinfo.com |url= http://www.ameinfo.com/53687.html |date=February 12, 2005 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130325175844/http://www.ameinfo.com/53687.html |archivedate=March 25, 2013 |accessdate=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; engineers initially used an [[Erector Set]] to visualize the complex interaction of the design&lt;ref name="pressrel1"&gt;{{cite press release|title=Chrysler Group Brings Minivan Segment's Only Stow 'n Go Seating And Storage System to Market in Just 18 Months |publisher=PRnewswire – Chrysler Group |url= http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chrysler-group-brings-minivan-segments-only-stow-n-go-seating-and-storage-system-to-market-in-just-18-months-58686772.html |date=January 5, 2004 |accessdate=March 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and redesigned under-floor components. The system included the spare tire well, fuel tank, exhaust system, parking brake cables, rear climate control lines, and rear suspension&lt;ref name="pressrel1"/&gt; but brought the elimination of [[Four-wheel drive|all-wheel drive]] (AWD). The system, in turn, creates a combined volume of {{convert|12|cuft|L}} of under-floor storage when second-row seats are deployed. With both rows folded, the vans have a flat-load floor and a maximum cargo volume of {{convert|160.7|cuft|L}}.&lt;ref name="ameinfo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="www.media.chrysler.com"&gt;{{cite press release|url= http://www.media.chrysler.com/newsrelease.do?&amp;id=129 |title=Stow 'N Go Seating and Storage System Solidifies Dodge Caravan as the Leader in Minivan Sales and Innovations |publisher=Chrysler Group |accessdate=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Stow 'n Go system received the Popular Science Magazine's "Best of What's New" for 2005 award.&lt;ref name="autointell"&gt;{{cite web|title=Stow 'n Go Minivan Technology Awarded Popular Science Magazine's "Best of What's New" for 2005 |publisher=Autointell.com |url= http://www.autointell.com/News-2004/November-2004/Nov-2004-3/Nov-17-04-p3.htm |date=November 10, 2004 |accessdate=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trim levels were again reshuffled on the Town &amp; Country, being available in a short-wheelbase base model, and long-wheelbase LX, Touring and Limited models.&lt;ref&gt;[http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/2005-chrysler-town-and-country.htm "2005 Chrysler Town &amp; Country"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110730005022/http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/2005-chrysler-town-and-country.htm |date=July 30, 2011 }}, retrieved on 2011–08–22.&lt;/ref&gt; As with the pre-refresh model, only the Touring and Limited were sold to consumers in Canada, the LX being restricted to fleets. A driver's side knee airbag was now standard on all models. The front seat-mounted side airbags of previous years were discontinued in favor of side-curtain airbags for all three rows. These were standard on Limited trim and optional on all other models, however could not be ordered with the moonroof option. Uconnect Bluetooth phone pairing was now available, as well as an overhead rail storage system with three moveable or removable compartments.

Taiwanese-market Town &amp; Country minivans were assembled in [[Yangmei District|Yangmei]], [[Taiwan]] under license by the [[China Motor Corporation]], starting with the 2006 model year. They are more closely related to the RG Grand Voyager than the RS Town &amp; Country sold in North America despite sharing a nameplate. Taiwanese models featured minor variations for the local market including LED taillights and mirror-mounted turn signals. In 2007, production ended and the production line was relocated to China where [[Soueast]] continued to assemble it under the [[Chrysler Grand Voyager]] and [[Dodge Grand Caravan]] nameplates from 2008 until late 2010.

Production of this generation continued in China under the Chrysler Grand Voyager and Dodge Grand Caravan nameplates from 2008, when the Taiwanese Town &amp; Country production line was relocated to [[Soueast]] (a [[joint venture]] between CMC, [[Mitsubishi Motors]] and the [[Fujian Motors Group]], until late 2010 when the facelifted fifth generation Chrysler Grand Voyager was introduced there. The Grand Caravan was replaced in this market by the [[Dodge Journey|JCUV]]. The Chinese Grand Voyager was identical to the Taiwanese Town &amp; Country, while the Grand Caravan was not based on the RS Grand Caravan sold in the United States and Canada. Instead, it was a modified version of the Grand Voyager with a new grille, incandescent taillights instead of the Grand Voyager's LED units, fender-mounted turn signals instead of mirror-mounted units, and wheels from the RS Grand Caravan. Chinese models were equipped with [[Mitsubishi 6G7x engine|Mitsubishi 6G72]] engines.

===Safety===
The 2001 model of this version earned a "Poor" rating in the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]]
's 40&amp;nbsp;mph offset test. It did protect its occupants reasonably well, and the dummy movement was well controlled, however, a fuel leak occurred. Chrysler corrected this problem starting with the 2002 models, moving it up to an "Acceptable" rating.

The 2006 model year brought optional side curtain airbags and a stronger B-pillar, which was tested by the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]]'s side impact crash test. With the side airbags, it got an "Acceptable" rating. For the driver, there is a chance of serious neck injuries, rib fractures and/or internal organ injuries. The rear passengers, however, could leave this accident unharmed, as there is a low risk of significant injury in a crash of this severity for them.

The 4th generation Town &amp; Country (Grand Voyager, as it is known in Europe))right hand drive (RHD) version performed very poorly in the [[Euro NCAP]] car safety tests and achieved the following ratings:&lt;ref name="Euro NCAP"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.euroncap.com/tests/chrysler_voyager_2007/277.aspx |title=For safer cars &amp;#124; Chrysler Voyager |publisher=Euro NCAP |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powertrains==
As with the previous generation, the Caravan came standard with a 2.4&amp;nbsp;L ''[[Chrysler Neon engine#2.4 and 2.4 Turbo|EDZ]]'' [[Straight-4|I4]] and a 3-speed [[TorqueFlite]] automatic transmission, with optional 3.3&amp;nbsp;L ''[[Chrysler 3.3 engine#3.3|EGA]]'' and 3.8&amp;nbsp;L ''[[Chrysler 3.3 engine#3.8|EGH]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]] engines, which came with a 4-speed [[Ultradrive]] automatic transmission. The 3.3L V6 was the standard engine on the Voyager and Town &amp; Country, as well as Canadian Caravans, where the 2.4L wasn't offered. Export models could be equipped with a 2.5 L Turbo Diesel ''[[List of VM Motori engines#R 425 DOHC|R 425]]''&lt;br /&gt; or a 2.8 L Turbo Diesel ''[[List of VM Motori engines#R 428 DOHC|R 428]]'' from [[VM Motori]], and were available with a 5-speed manual transmission. Chinese models got a 3.0 L ''[[Mitsubishi 6G7 engine|6G72]]''.

The '''Civaux [[Nuclear Power]] Plant''' is located in the commune of [[Civaux]] ([[Vienne]]) at the edge of [[Vienne (river)|Vienne River]] between [[Confolens]] (60&amp;nbsp;km upstream) and [[Chauvigny]] (14&amp;nbsp;km downstream), and 44&amp;nbsp;km south-east of [[Poitiers]].

It has two operating units that were the precursors to the [[European Pressurized Reactor]], being the "N4 stage". Designed for a net power output of 1350 [[MWe]] per unit, power was uprated to 1360 MWe in 2010. The Civaux plant uses ambient air and water from the Vienne River for cooling.&lt;ref name=ASN&gt;{{cite web|title=La centrale de Civaux|url=http://www.asn.fr/index.php/L-ASN-en-region/Division-de-Bordeaux/Centrales-nucleaires/Centrale-nucleaire-de-Civaux|author=[[Autorité de sûreté nucléaire|ASN]]|access-date=19 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2014, 582 people work at the plant, with 2.9% women.

The [[cooling tower]]s of Civaux Nuclear Power Plant are 178 metres in height, , which are the highest among those of EDF's nuclear power plants.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.afsset.fr/upload/bibliotheque/561815558868098059295787283143/legionella_cnpe_afsset_oct07.pdf Document [[Agence française de sécurité sanitaire de l'environnement et du travail|Afsset]]], 10 octobre 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
*On May 12, 1998 there was a leak on an elbow in a pipe of the RCS.  Water leaked out at the rate of 30 cubic meters per hour.  It was classified as a [[International Nuclear Event Scale|INES]] level-2 event.
*Civaux was a proposed target in the [[1998 World Cup terror plot]]; it was planned that [[Armed Islamic Group]] terrorists would crash a hijacked aeroplane into the plant on 15 June 1998. The plot was foiled with a mass arrest of conspirators on 26 May.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32498">The interaction of matter with light, i.e., [[electromagnetic fields]], is able to generate a coherent superposition of excited [[quantum states]] in the material.
''[[Coherence (physics)|Coherent]]'' denotes the fact that the material excitations have a well defined [[Phase (waves)|phase relation]] which originates from the phase of the incident [[electromagnetic wave]].
Macroscopically, the [[superposition principle|superposition]] state of the material results in an optical [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]], i.e., a rapidly oscillating dipole density.
The optical polarization is a genuine non-equilibrium quantity that decays to zero when the excited system relaxes to its equilibrium state after the electromagnetic pulse is switched off.
Due to this decay which is called ''dephasing'', coherent effects are observable only for a certain temporal duration after pulsed [[photoexcitation]]. Various materials such as atoms, molecules, metals, insulators, semiconductors  are studied using coherent optical spectroscopy and such experiments and their theoretical analysis has revealed a wealth of insights on the involved matter states and their dynamical evolution.

This article focusses on coherent optical effects in semiconductors and semiconductor nanostructures.

Then, a few prominent examples for coherent effects in semiconductor optics are described all of which can be understood theoretically on the basis of the SBEs.

==Starting point==

Macroscopically, [[Maxwell's equations]] show that in the absence of free charges and currents an electromagnetic field interacts with matter via the optical polarization &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf P}&lt;/math&gt;.
The [[wave equation]] for the [[electric field]] &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf E}&lt;/math&gt; reads &lt;math&gt;(\nabla \cdot \nabla - \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}) {\mathbf E}({\mathbf r},t) = \mu_0 \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} {\mathbf P}({\mathbf r},t)&lt;/math&gt; and shows that the second derivative with respect to time of &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf P}&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}{\mathbf P}&lt;/math&gt;, appears as a source term in the wave equation for the electric field &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf E}&lt;/math&gt;.
Thus, for optically thin samples and measurements performed in the far-field, i.e., at distances significantly exceedng the optical wavelength &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, the emitted electric field resulting from the polarization is proportional to its second time derivative, i.e., &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf E} \propto \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}{\mathbf P}&lt;/math&gt;.
Therefore, measuring the dynamics of the emitted field &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf E}(t)&lt;/math&gt; provides direct information on the temporal evolution of the optical material polarization &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf P}(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

Microscopically, the optical polarization arises from [[quantum mechanical transitions]] between different states of the material system.
For the case of semiconductors, electromagnetic radiation with optical frequencies is able to move electrons from the valence (&lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;) to the conduction (&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;) band.
The macroscopic polarization &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf P}&lt;/math&gt; is computed by summing over all microscopic transition dipoles &lt;math&gt;p_{cv}&lt;/math&gt; via &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf P} = \frac{1}{V}\sum_{c,v} ({\mathbf d}_{cv} p_{cv} + \mathrm{c.c.} )&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name=Haug2009 /&gt; where &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf d}_{cv}&lt;/math&gt; is the dipole matrix element which determines the strength of individual transitions between the states &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{c.c.}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the complex conjugate, and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the appropriately chosen system's volume.
If &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_v&lt;/math&gt; are the energies of the conduction and valence band states, their dynamic quantum mechanical evolution is according to the Schrödinger equation given by phase factors &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i} \epsilon_c \, t/\hbar}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i} \epsilon_v \, t/\hbar}&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.
The superposition state described by &lt;math&gt;p_{cv}&lt;/math&gt; is evolving in time according to &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i} (\epsilon_c - \epsilon_v) t/\hbar}&lt;/math&gt;.
Assuming that we start at &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;p_{cv}(t=0) = p_{cv,0}&lt;/math&gt;, we have for the optical polarization

&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf P} (t) = \sum_{c,v} ( {\mathbf d}_{cv} p_{cv,0} \, \mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i} (\epsilon_c - \epsilon_v) t/\hbar} + \mathrm{c.c.} )&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus, &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf P} (t)&lt;/math&gt; is given by a summation over the microscopic transition dipoles which all oscillate with frequencies corresponding to the energy differences between the involved quantum states.
Clearly, the optical polarization &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf P} (t)&lt;/math&gt; is a coherent quantity which is characterized by an amplitude and a phase.
Depending on the phase relationships of the microscopic transition dipoles, one may obtain constructive or destructive interference, in which the microscopic dipoles are in or out of phase, respectively, and temporal interference phenomena like quantum beats, in which the [[Absolute value|modulus]] of &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf P} (t)&lt;/math&gt; varies as function of time.

Ignoring [[many-body effects]] and the coupling to other quasi particles and to reservoirs, the dynamics of photoexcited two-level systems can be described by a set of two equations, the so-called [[optical Bloch equations]].&lt;ref name="Allen1987"&gt;
Allen, L.; Eberly, J. H. (1987). ''Optical Resonance and Two-Level Atoms''. Dover Publications. {{ISBN|0486655334}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
These equations are named after [[Felix Bloch]] who formulated them in order to analyze the dynamics of spin systems in nuclear magnetic resonance.
The two-level Bloch equations read

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{i} \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} p_{cv} = \Delta \epsilon \, p_{cv} + {\mathbf E} \cdot {\mathbf d} I&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{i} \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} I = 2 {\mathbf E} \cdot {\mathbf d} ( p_{cv} - p_{cv}^\star ).&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;\Delta \epsilon=(\epsilon_c - \epsilon_v)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the energy difference between the two states and &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Population inversion|inversion]], i.e., the difference in the occupations of the upper and the lower states.
The electric field &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf E}&lt;/math&gt; couples the microscopic polarization &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; to the product of the Rabi energy &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf E} \cdot {\mathbf d}&lt;/math&gt; and the inversion &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;.
In the absence of the driving electric field, i.e., for &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf E} = \mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt;, the Bloch equation for &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; describes an oscillation, i.e., &lt;math&gt;p_{cv} (t) \propto \mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i} \Delta \epsilon \, t/\hbar}&lt;/math&gt;.

The optical Bloch equations enable a transparent analysis of several nonlinear optical experiments.
They are, however, only well suited for systems with optical transitions between isolated levels in which many-body interactions are of minor importance as is sometimes the case in atoms or small molecules.
In solid state systems, such as semiconductors and semiconductor nanostructures, an adequate description of the many-body Coulomb interaction and the coupling to additional degrees of freedom is essential and thus the optical Bloch equations are not applicable.

==The semiconductor Bloch equations (SBEs)==

For a realistic description of optical processes in solid materials, it is essential to go beyond the simple picture of the optical Bloch equations and to treat many-body interactions that describe the coupling among the elementary material excitations by, e.g., the see article [[Coulomb interaction]] between the electrons and the coupling to other degrees of freedom, such as lattice vibrations, i.e., the electron-phonon coupling.
Within a semiclassical approach, where the light field is treated as a classical electromagnetic field and the material excitations are described quantum mechanically, all above mentioned effects can be treated microscopically on the basis of a many-body quantum theory.
For semiconductors the resulting system of equations are known as the [[semiconductor Bloch equations]].
For the simplest case of a two-band model of a semiconductor, the SBEs can be written schematically as&lt;ref name="Haug2009" /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{i} \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} p_{\mathbf k} = \Delta \varepsilon_{\mathbf k} \,
p_{\mathbf k} + \Omega_{\mathbf k} \, (n^c_{\mathbf k} - n^v_{\mathbf k})
+ \mathrm{i} \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} p_{\mathbf k}|_{\text{corr}} \, ,
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{i} \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} n^c_{\mathbf k} =
( \Omega_{\mathbf k}^\star \, p_{\mathbf k} - \Omega_{\mathbf k} \, p_{\mathbf k}^\star )
+ \mathrm{i} \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} n^c_{\mathbf k}|_{\text{corr}} \, ,
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{i} \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} n^v_{\mathbf k} =
- ( \Omega_{\mathbf k}^\star \, p_{\mathbf k} - \Omega_{\mathbf k} \, p_{\mathbf k}^\star )
+ \mathrm{i} \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} n^v_{\mathbf k}|_{\text{corr}} \, .
&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;p_{\mathbf k}&lt;/math&gt; is the microscopic polarization and &lt;math&gt;n^c_{\mathbf k}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n^v_{\mathbf k}&lt;/math&gt; are the electron occupations in the conduction and valence bands (&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;), respectively, and &lt;math&gt;\hbar {\mathbf k}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the crystal momentum.
As a result of the many-body Coulomb interaction and possibly further interaction processes, the transition energy &lt;math&gt;\Delta \varepsilon_{\mathbf k}&lt;/math&gt; and the Rabi energy &lt;math&gt;\Omega_{\mathbf k}&lt;/math&gt; both depend on the state of the excited system, i.e., they are functions of the time-dependent polarizations &lt;math&gt;p_{\mathbf k'}&lt;/math&gt; and occupations &lt;math&gt;n^c_{\mathbf k'}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n^v_{\mathbf k'}&lt;/math&gt;, respectively, at all crystal momenta &lt;math&gt;\hbar {\mathbf k'}&lt;/math&gt;.

Due to this coupling among the excitations for all values of the crystal momentum &lt;math&gt;\hbar {\mathbf k}&lt;/math&gt;, the optical excitations in semiconductor cannot be described on the level of isolated optical transitions but have to be treated as an interacting many-body quantum system.

A prominent and important result of the Coulomb interaction among the photoexcitations
is the appearance of strongly absorbing discrete [[exciton]]ic resonances which show up in the absorption spectra of semiconductors spectrally below the fundamental band gap frequency. 
Since an exciton consists of a negatively charged conduction band electron and a positively charged valence band hole (i.e., an electron missing in the valence band) which attract each other via the Coulomb interaction, excitons have a hydrogenic series of discrete absorption lines. 
Due to the optical selection rules of typical III-V semiconductors such as Galliumarsenide (GaAs) only the s-states, i.e., 1''s'', 2''s'', etc., can be optically excited and detected, see article on [[Wannier equation]].

The many-body Coulomb interaction leads to significant complications since it results in an infinite hierarchy of dynamic equations for the microscopic correlation functions that describe the nonlinear optical response.
The terms given explicitly in the SBEs above arise from a treatment of the Coulomb interaction in the time-dependent Hartree–Fock approximation. 
Whereas this level is sufficient to describe excitonic resonances, there are several further effects, e.g., excitation-induced dephasing, contributions from higher-order correlations like excitonic populations and biexcitonic resonances, which require one to treat so-called many-body correlation effects that are by definition beyond the Hartree–Fock level.
These contributions are formally included in the SBEs given above in the terms denoted by &lt;math&gt;|_\text{corr}&lt;/math&gt;.

The systematic truncation of the many-body hierarchy and the development and the analysis of controlled approximations schemes is an important topic in the microscopic theory of the optical processes in condensed matter systems.
Depending on the particular system and the excitation conditions several approximations schemes have been developed and applied.
For highly excited systems, it is often sufficient to describe many-body Coulomb correlations using the second order Born approximation.&lt;ref name="Jahnke1996"&gt;Jahnke, F.; Kira, M.; Koch, S. W.; Tai, K. (1996). "Excitonic Nonlinearities of Semiconductor Microcavities in the Nonperturbative Regime". ''Physical Review Letters'' '''77''' (26): 5257–5260. doi:[https://dx.doi.org/10.1103%2FPhysRevLett.77.5257 10.1103/PhysRevLett.77.5257]&lt;/ref&gt;
Such calculations were, in particular, able to successfully describe the spectra of semiconductor lasers, see article on [[semiconductor laser theory]].

==Selected coherent effects==

By nonlinear optical spectroscopy using ultrafast laser pulses with durations on the order of ten to hundreds of [[femtoseconds]], several coherent effects have been observed and interpreted.
Such studies and their proper theoretical analysis have revealed a wealth of information on the nature of the photoexcited quantum states, the coupling among them, and their dynamical evolution on ultrashort time scales. In the following, a few important effects are briefly described.

===Quantum beats involving excitons and exciton complexes===

Quantum beats are observable in systems in which the total optical polarization is due to a finite number of discrete transition frequencies which are quantum mechanically coupled, e.g., by common ground or excited states.&lt;ref name="KochFeldmann1992"&gt;
Koch, M.; Feldmann, J.; von Plessen, G.; Göbel, E.; Thomas, P.; Köhler, K. (1992). "Quantum beats versus polarization interference: An experimental distinction". ''Physical Review Letters'' '''69''' (25): 3631–3634. doi:[https://dx.doi.org/10.1103%2FPhysRevLett.69.3631 10.1103/PhysRevLett.69.3631]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ErlandBalslev1993"&gt;Erland, J.; Balslev, I. (1993). "Theory of quantum beat and polarization interference in four-wave mixing". ''Physical Review A'' '''48''' (3): R1765–R1768. doi:[https://dx.doi.org/10.1103%2FPhysRevA.48.R1765 10.1103/PhysRevA.48.R1765]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Koch1996"&gt;
Koch, M.; von Plessen, G.; Feldman, J.; Göbel, E. O. (1996). "Excitonic quantum beats in semiconductor quantum-well structures". ''Chemical Physics'' '''210''' (1-2): 367–388. doi:[https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2F0301-0104%2896%2900135-8 10.1016/0301-0104(96)00135-8]&lt;/ref&gt;
Assuming for simplicity that all these transitions have the same dipole matrix element, after excitation with a short laser pulse at &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt; the optical polarization &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf P} (t)&lt;/math&gt; of the system evolves as

&lt;math&gt;\sum_l \mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i} \Delta \omega_{l} t}&lt;/math&gt;,

where the index &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; labels the participating transitions.
A finite number of frequencies results in temporal modulations of the squared modulus of the polarization &lt;math&gt;|{\mathbf P} (t)|^2&lt;/math&gt; and thus of the intensity of the emitted electromagnetic field &lt;math&gt;|{\mathbf E} (t)|^2&lt;/math&gt; with time periods

&lt;math&gt;2 \pi/(\Delta \omega_{l} - \Delta \omega_{j})&lt;/math&gt;.

For the case of just two frequencies the squared modulus of the polarization is proportional to

&lt;math&gt;[1+\cos((\Delta \omega_1 - \Delta \omega_2)t)]&lt;/math&gt;,

i.e., due to the interference of two contributions with the same amplitude but different frequencies, the polarization varies between a maximum and zero.

In semiconductors and semiconductor heterostructures, such as quantum wells, nonlinear optical quantum-beat spectroscopy has been widely used to investigate the temporal dynamics of excitonic resonances.
In particular, the consequences of many-body effects which depending on the excitation conditions may lead to, e.g., a coupling among different excitonic resonances via biexcitons and other Coulomb correlation contributions and to a decay of the coherent dynamics by scattering and dephasing processes, has been explored in many pump-probe and four-wave-mixing measurements.
The theoretical analysis of such experiments in semiconductors requires a treatment on the basis of quantum mechanical many-body theory as is provided by the SBEs with many-body correlations incorporated on an adequate level.&lt;ref name="Schafer2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Haug2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Meier2007" /&gt;

===Photon echoes of excitons===

In nonlinear optics it is possible to reverse the destructive interference of so-called inhomogeneously broadened systems which contain a distribution of uncoupled subsystems with different resonance frequencies.
For example, let us consider a four-wave-mixing experiment in which the first short laser pulse excites all transitions at &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt;.
As a result of the destructive interference between the different frequencies the overall polarization decays to zero.
A second pulse arriving at &lt;math&gt;t=\tau&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; is able to conjugate the phases of the individual microscopic polarizations, i.e., &lt;math&gt;p \rightarrow p^\star&lt;/math&gt;, of the inhomogeneously broadened system.
The subsequent unperturbed dynamical evolution of the polarizations leads to rephasing such that all polarization are in phase at &lt;math&gt;t=2\tau&lt;/math&gt; which results in a measurable macroscopic signal.
Thus, this so-called photon echo occurs since all individual polarizations are in phase and add up constructively at &lt;math&gt;t=2\tau&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Allen1987" /&gt;
Since the rephasing is only possible if the polarizations remain coherent, the loss of coherence can be determined by measuring the decay of the photon echo amplitude with increasing time delay.

When photon echo experiments are performed in semiconductors with exciton resonances,&lt;ref name="Noll1990"&gt;Noll, G.; Siegner, U.; Shevel, S.; Göbel, E. (1990). "Picosecond stimulated photon echo due to intrinsic excitations in semiconductor mixed crystals". ''Physical Review Letters'' '''64''' (7): 792–795. doi:[https://dx.doi.org/10.1103%2FPhysRevLett.64.792 10.1103/PhysRevLett.64.792]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Webb1991"&gt;Webb, M.; Cundiff, S.; Steel, D. (1991). "Observation of time-resolved picosecond stimulated photon echoes and free polarization decay in GaAs/AlGaAs multiple quantum wells". ''Physical Review Letters'' '''66''' (7): 934–937. doi:[https://dx.doi.org/10.1103%2FPhysRevLett.66.934 10.1103/PhysRevLett.66.934]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Koch1993"&gt;Koch, M.; Weber, D.; Feldmann, J.; Göbel, E.; Meier, T.; Schulze, A.; Thomas, P.; Schmitt-Rink, S. et al. (1993). "Subpicosecond photon-echo spectroscopy on GaAs/AlAs short-period superlattices". ''Physical Review B'' '''47''' (3): 1532–1539. doi:[https://dx.doi.org/10.1103%2FPhysRevB.47.1532 10.1103/PhysRevB.47.1532]&lt;/ref&gt; it is essential to include many-body effects in the theoretical analysis since they may qualitatively alter the dynamics. For example, numerical solutions of the SBEs have demonstrated that the dynamical reduction of the band gap which originates from the Coulomb interaction among the photoexcited electrons and holes is able to generate a photon echo even for resonant excitation of a single discrete exciton resonance with a pulse of sufficient intensity.&lt;ref name="Lindberg1992"&gt;Lindberg, M.; Binder, R.; Koch, S. (1992). "Theory of the semiconductor photon echo". ''Physical Review A'' '''45''' (3): 1865–1875. doi:[https://dx.doi.org/10.1103%2FPhysRevA.45.1865 10.1103/PhysRevA.45.1865]&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the rather simple effect of inhomogeneous broadening, spatial fluctuations of the energy, i.e., disorder, which in semiconductor nanostructure may, e.g., arise from imperfection of the interfaces between different materials, can also lead to a decay of the photon echo amplitude with increasing time delay. To consistently treat this phenomenon of disorder induced dephasing the SBEs need to be solved including biexciton correlations.
As shown in Ref.&lt;ref name="WeiserMeier2000"&gt;Weiser, S.; Meier, T.; Möbius, J.; Euteneuer, A.; Mayer, E.; Stolz, W.; Hofmann, M.; Rühle, W.; Thomas, P.; Koch, S. (2000). "Disorder-induced dephasing in semiconductors". ''Physical Review B'' '''61''' (19): 13088–13098. doi:[https://dx.doi.org/10.1103%2FPhysRevB.61.13088 10.1103/PhysRevB.61.13088]
&lt;/ref&gt; such a microscopic theoretical approach is able to describe disorder induced dephasing in good agreement with experimental results.

===The excitonic optical Stark effect===

In a pump-probe experiment one excites the system with a pump pulse (&lt;math&gt;E_p&lt;/math&gt;) and probes its dynamics with a (weak) test pulse (&lt;math&gt;E_t&lt;/math&gt;).
With such experiments one can measure the so-called differential absorption &lt;math&gt;\Delta \alpha (\omega)&lt;/math&gt;  which is defined as the difference between the probe absorption in the presence of the pump &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{\text{pump on}} (\omega)&lt;/math&gt; and the probe absorption without the pump &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{\text{pump off}} (\omega)&lt;/math&gt;.

For resonant pumping of an optical resonance and when the pump precedes the test, the absorption change &lt;math&gt;\Delta \alpha&lt;/math&gt; is usually negative in the vicinity of the resonance frequency.
This effect called bleaching arises from the fact that the excitation of the system with the pump pulse reduces the absorbance of the test pulse.
There may also be positive contributions to &lt;math&gt;\Delta \alpha&lt;/math&gt; spectrally near the original absorption line due to resonance broadening and at other spectral positions due to excited-state absorption, i.e., optical transitions to states such as biexcitons which are only possible if the system is in an excited state.
The bleaching and the positive contributions are generally present in both coherent and incoherent situations where the polarization vanishes but occupations in excited states are present.

For detuned pumping, i.e., when the frequency of the pump field is not identical with the frequency of the material transition, the resonance frequency shifts as a result of the light-matter coupling, an effect known as the optical Stark effect.
The optical Stark effect requires coherence i.e., a non vanishing optical polarization induced be the pump pulse, and thus decreases with increasing time delay between the pump and probe pulses and vanishes if the system has returned to its ground state.

As can be shown by solving the optical Bloch equations for a two-level system due to the optical Stark effect the resonance frequency should shift to higher values, if the pump frequency is smaller than the resonance frequency and vice versa.&lt;ref name="Allen1987" /&gt;
This is also the typical result of experiments performed on excitons in semiconductors.&lt;ref name="Fröhlich1985"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mysyrowicz1986"&gt;Mysyrowicz, A.; Hulin, D.; Antonetti, A.; Migus, A.; Masselink, W.; Morkoç, H. (1986).

''Physical Review Letters'' '''56''' (25): 2748–2751. doi:[https://dx.doi.org/10.1103%2FPhysRevLett.56.2748 10.1103/PhysRevLett.56.2748]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Von Lehmen1986"&gt;Von Lehmen, A.; Chemla, D. S.; Zucker, J. E.; Heritage, J. P. (1986). "Optical Stark effect on excitons in GaAs quantum wells". ''Optics Letters'' '''11''' (10): 609. doi:[https://dx.doi.org/10.1364%2FOL.11.000609 10.1364/OL.11.000609]&lt;/ref&gt;
The fact that in certain situations such predictions which are based on simple models fail to even qualitatively describe experiments in semiconductors and semiconductor [[nanostructures]] has received significant attention.
Such deviations are because in semiconductors typically many-body effects dominate the optical response and therefore it is required to solve the SBEs instead of the optical Bloch equations to obtain an adequate understanding.{{clarify|complicated sentence|date=August 2015}}
An important example was presented in Ref.&lt;ref name="Sieh1999"&gt;Sieh, C.; Meier, T.; Jahnke, F.; Knorr, A.; Koch, S.; Brick, P.; Hübner, M.; Ell, C.; Prineas, J.; Khitrova, G.; Gibbs, H. (1999). "Coulomb Memory Signatures in the Excitonic Optical Stark Effect". ''Physical Review Letters'' '''82''' (15): 3112–3115. doi:[https://dx.doi.org/10.1103%2FPhysRevLett.82.3112 10.1103/PhysRevLett.82.3112]&lt;/ref&gt; where it was shown that many-body correlations arising from biexcitons are able to reverse the sign of the optical Stark effect. In contrast to the optical Bloch equations, the SBEs including coherent biexcitonic correlations were able to properly describe the experiments performed on semiconductor quantum wells.

===Superradiance of excitons===

Let us consider &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; two-level systems at different positions in space.
Maxwell's equations lead to a coupling among all the optical resonances since the field emitted from a specific resonance interferes with the emitted fields of all other resonances.
As a result, the system is characterized by &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; eigenmodes originating from the radiatively coupled optical resonances.

A spectacular situation arises if &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; identical two-level systems are regularly arranged with distances that equals an integer multiple of &lt;math&gt;\lambda/2&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the optical wavelength.
In this case, the emitted fields of all resonances interfere constructively and the system behaves effectively as a single system with a &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;-times stronger optical polarization.
Since the intensity of the emitted electromagnetic field is proportional to the squared modulus of the polarization, it scales initially as &lt;math&gt;N^2&lt;/math&gt;.

Due to the cooperativity that originates from the coherent coupling of the subsystems, the radiative decay rate &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{\mathrm{rad}}&lt;/math&gt; is increased by &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{\mathrm{rad}} = N \gamma_{\mathrm{rad},0}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{\mathrm{rad},0}&lt;/math&gt; is the radiative decay of a single two-level system.
Thus the coherent optical polarization decays &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;-times faster proportional to &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{e}^{- N \gamma_{\mathrm{rad},0} \, t}&lt;/math&gt; than that of an isolated system.
As a result the time integrated emitted field intensity scales as &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, since the initial &lt;math&gt;N^2&lt;/math&gt; factor is multiplied by &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{N}&lt;/math&gt; which arises from the time integral over the enhanced radiative decay.

This effect of superradiance&lt;ref name="Dicke1954"&gt;Dicke, R. (1954). "Coherence in Spontaneous Radiation Processes". ''Physical Review'' '''93''' (1): 99–110. doi:[https://dx.doi.org/10.1103%2FPhysRev.93.99 10.1103/PhysRev.93.99]&lt;/ref&gt; has been demonstrated by monitoring the decay of the exciton polarization in suitably arranged semiconductor multiple quantum wells.
Due to superradiance introduced by the coherent radiative coupling among the quantum wells, the decay rate increases proportional to the number of quantum wells and is thus significantly more rapid than for a single quantum well.&lt;ref name="HübnerKuhl1996"&gt;
Hübner, M.; Kuhl, J.; Stroucken, T.; Knorr, A.; Koch, S.; Hey, R.; Ploog, K. (1996). "Collective Effects of Excitons in Multiple-Quantum-Well Bragg and Anti-Bragg Structures". ''Physical Review Letters'' '''76''' (22): 4199–4202. doi:[https://dx.doi.org/10.1103%2FPhysRevLett.76.4199 10.1103/PhysRevLett.76.4199]&lt;/ref&gt;
The theoretical analysis of this phenomenon requires a consistent solution of Maxwell's equations together with the SBEs.

==Concluding remarks==

The few examples given above represent only a small subset of several further phenomena which demonstrate that the coherent optical response of semiconductors and semiconductor nanostructures is strongly influenced by many-body effects.
Other interesting research directions which similarly require an adequate theoretical analysis including many-body interactions are, e.g., phototransport phenomena where optical fields generate and/or probe electronic currents, the combined spectroscopy with optical and [[Terahertz radiation|Terahertz]] field, see article [[Terahertz spectroscopy and technology]], and the rapidly developing area of semiconductor [[quantum optics]], see article [[Semiconductor quantum optics with dots]].

The project uses [[heliostat]] mirrors that collect and focus the sun's thermal energy to heat [[molten salt]] flowing through a [[solar power tower]]. The molten salt circulates from the tower to a storage tank, where it is then used to produce steam and generate electricity. Excess thermal energy is stored in the molten salt and can be used to generate power for up to fourteen hours, including during the evening hours and when direct sunlight is not available. The project's solar tower component technology is based on the SolarReserve [[Crescent Dunes Solar Energy Project]] in the US.

The project is expected to cost $2 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Cycle oil''' is a light [[lubricating oil]] suited for use on bicycles and similar devices.  It is a liquid [[residue (chemistry)|residue]] produced in the [[petroleum industry]] when [[catalytic cracking]] is employed to convert heavy [[hydrocarbon]] fractions remaining from earlier stages of [[Oil refinery|crude oil refining]] into more valuable lighter products[http://www.aip.com.au/industry/fact_refine.htm]. 

Catalytic cracking produces [[petrol]] (gasoline), [[liquid petroleum gas]] (LPG), unsaturated [[olefin]] compounds, cracked [[gas oil]]s, cycle oil, light gases and a solid [[Petroleum coke|coke]] residue. Cycle oil may be processed further to break it down into more useful products; in particular it may be mixed with heavier products and put through the refining process again (recycled).

Towards the GIC end of the spectrum, there is increasing fluoride release and increasing acid-base content; towards the composite resin end of the spectrum, there is increasing light cure percentage and increased flexural strength.]]
'''Dental compomers''' are materials which are used in dentistry as [[dental restorative materials|restorative material]]. They were introduced in the early 1990s as a hybrid of two other dental materials: [[dental composites]] and [[glass ionomer cement]]. They are also known as polyacid-modified resin composites. They are used for restorations in low stress–bearing areas

==History==
Compomers were introduced in the early 1990s. Previous available restorative materials included [[dental amalgam]], [[glass ionomer cement]], resin modified glass ionomer cement and [[dental composites]].

==Composition==
The composition of compomers is similar to that of a [[dental composite]] however it has been modified, making it a polyacid-modified composite. This results in compomers still requiring a bonding system to bond to tooth tissue. Compomer contains poly acid–modified monomers and fluoride-releasing silicate glasses. An acid-base reaction occurs as the compomer absorbs water after contact with saliva, which facilitates cross-linking structure and fluoride release.

==Features==
===Fluoride release===
Compomers release some fluoride ions, like a glass ionomer cement. The level of this fluoride release however is only around 10% of that of a glass ionomer, which makes it less useful for deciduous restorations. It has been shown to have no advantage over an amalgam restoration with a fluoride releasing bonding agent, which releases mercury and fluoride.&lt;ref&gt;Trachtenberg F. Maserejian NN. Soncini JA. Hayes C. Tavares M. Does fluoride in compomers prevent future caries in children? ''Journal of Dental Research'', 88(3):276-9, 2009 Mar.&lt;/ref&gt; Compomers also do not have the ability to 'recharge' their fluoride ion content with topically applied fluoride from toothpaste etc., like glass ionomer cements; this is another limit on their efficacy. Compomers are recommended for patients at medium risk of developing caries.

===Handling===
Handling and ease of use of composites is generally seen as good by dental professionals.&lt;ref name='van Noort, 2007'&gt;{{cite book | last = van Noort | first = Richard | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Introduction to Dental Materials | publisher = Mosby | year = 2007 | location = Edinburgh |pages = | url = | doi = | id = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Compomers are available in both normal and flowable forms, with the manufacturers of the flowable compomers claiming that they have the ability to shape to the cavity without the need for hand instruments.

===Aesthetics===
Compomers are tooth coloured materials, and so their aesthetics can immediately be seen as better than that of dental amalgams. It has been shown that ratings in various aesthetic areas are better for compomers than resin modified glass ionomer cements.&lt;ref&gt;Folwaczny M, Mehl A, Kunzelmann KH, Hickel R. Clinical performance of a resin-modified glass-ionomer and a compomer in restoring non-carious cervical lesions. 5-year results. ''American Journal of Dentistry'', 14(3):153-6, 2001 Jun.&lt;/ref&gt; Compomers are also available in various non-natural colours from various dental companies for use in deciduous teeth.

{{About|a fictional substance|the real molecule|Dilithium}}

In the ''[[Star Trek]]'' [[fictional universe]], '''dilithium''' is an [[List of fictional elements, materials, isotopes and atomic particles|invented material]] which serves as a controlling agent in the [[faster-than-light]] [[warp drive]]. In [[Star Trek: The Original Series|the original series]], dilithium crystals were rare and could not be [[replicator (Star Trek)|replicated]], making the search for them a recurring plot element. According to a periodic table shown during a ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation|Next Generation]]'' episode, it has the [[chemical symbol]] Dt and the [[atomic number]] 87, which in reality belongs to [[francium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| series=Star Trek: The Next Generation|serieslink=Star Trek: The Next Generation| title=Rascals|episodelink=Rascals (Star Trek: The Next Generation)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the real world, [[dilithium]] (Li{{Sub|2}}) is a [[molecule]] composed of two [[covalent bond|covalently bonded]] lithium atoms.

==Description and usage==
Dilithium is depicted as an extremely hard [[crystal]]line mineral that occurs naturally on some planets. It is believed that this material exists in more than three dimensions at the same time and this is somehow related to its properties. When placed in a high-frequency electromagnetic field, [[eddy current]]s are induced in its structure which keep charged particles away from the crystal lattice. This prevents it from reacting with [[antimatter]] when so energized, because the antimatter particles never actually touch it. Therefore, it is used to contain and regulate the annihilation reaction of matter and antimatter in a starship's warp core, which otherwise would explode from the uncontrolled annihilation reaction. Though low-quality artificial crystals can be grown or replicated, they are limited in the power of the reaction they can regulate without fragmenting, and are therefore largely unsuitable for warp drive applications. Due to the need for natural dilithium crystals for interstellar travel, deposits of this material are, much like real-world equivalents such as oil, a highly contested resource, and as such, dilithium crystals have led to more interstellar conflict than all other reasons combined.

In the original series, dilithium crystals were rare and could not be [[Replicator (Star Trek)|replicated]]. In ''[[Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home]]'' [[Spock]] re-crystallized a [[Klingon Bird of Prey]]'s decaying dilithium through exposure to high-energy [[photon]]s as generated by 20th century [[Nuclear fission|fission]] reactors.

As shown on the series, the streams of [[matter]] (deuterium gas) and [[antimatter]] (anti-deuterium) directed into crystallized dilithium are unbalanced: there is usually much more matter in the stream than antimatter. The energy generated in the annihilation reaction heats up the excess deuterium gas, producing a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] that is used to power the [[warp nacelle]]s thus allowing a [[starship]] to travel [[Faster-than-light|faster than light]]. In addition, most starships use this plasma as a power source for the ship's systems; in the series ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' (2001-2005), this was referred to as an ''electro-plasma system'', (a [[backronym]] of the term "EPS", which was used in all other series except [[Star Trek: The Original Series|the original series]]) to refer to a ship's or station's power system. The specific details of this reaction were officially established in the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' (1987-1994) series and technical manual; in earlier works it is not clearly defined.

Dilithium is a member of the fictional hypersonic series of elements, according to a periodic table graphic seen in episodes of ''Star Trek: The Next Generation''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| series=Star Trek: The Next Generation|serieslink=Star Trek: The Next Generation| title=Rascals|episodelink=Rascals (Star Trek: The Next Generation)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' (1993-1999). The dilithium crystal structure is 2(5)6 dilithium 2(:)l diallosilicate 1:9:1 heptoferranide, according to the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual]]'' (1991).

'''Garuda Indonesia Airways Flight 150''' was a scheduled [[Indonesia]]n domestic passenger flight from [[Kemayoran Airport]], [[Jakarta]] to [[Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin II Airport]], [[Palembang]]. On September 24, 1975, Flight 150 crashed on approach due to poor weather and fog just 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) from the town of Palembang. The accident killed 25 out of 61 passengers and crew on board and an additional person who was killed on the ground.

==Aircraft==
The [[Fokker F-28 Fellowship]] registration PK-GVC was built in 1971 and had done over 1000 hours of flying time before the fatal accident.

==The accident==
Garuda Indonesia Airways Flight 150 took off from Kemayoran Airport on a short-haul flight to Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin II Airport with 61 passengers and crew on board. Less than 1 hour after take off, Flight 150 was cleared by the [[air traffic controller]]s at Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin II Airport to start their approach to land on runway 28. The flaps and landing gear were down as flight 150 was nearing the airport when fog started shadowing the town and the airport. Flight 150 entered the fog two minutes later. The tail end of the aircraft hit trees and crashed breaking it up into 2 parts. There was no fire when flight 150 crashed. The crash killed 25 people on board and 1 person on the ground. 36 passengers survived the crash and were taken to a local hospital.

==Cause==
An investigation into the crash found that the visual flight in weather conditions below minimums. Flight 150 was in a downwind leg as the aircraft was on approach to the airport in fog. It is unknown why the air traffic controller did not tell the pilots of flight 150 to execute a missed approach or why the pilots themselves didn't execute a missed approach.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2511">The '''Great Storm of 1854''' (also known as the '''[[Balaklava]] Storm''') occurred in and around the [[Black Sea]] on 14 November 1854. It caused severe damage and caused major disruption to armed forces (and especially naval forces) in the region engaged in the [[Crimean War]].

At the time of the storm, the British and allied supply fleet was in the Black Sea with all of the supplies for the winter campaign.  A strong gale blew up and began battering the fleet. Eyewitness accounts record the flattening of tents and uprooting of trees, and at least 37 ships were either severely damaged or wrecked.&lt;ref name="Lindgren"&gt;Lindgrén, S., and Neumann, J., "[https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/1520-0477%281980%29061%3C1570%3AGHETWS%3E2.0.CO%3B2 Great historical events that were significantly affected by the weather: 5. Some meteorological events of the Crimean War and their consequences]," ''Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society'', ''61'', 12 (December 1980). pp. 1570-1583.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the winter supplies were lost, including food, fuel, and winter uniforms. As a result, many men died from hypothermia and disease.

The storm caused a series of scandals. Funds raised to help the troops disappeared, much of it into the pockets of officers. It was also discovered that the storm had been tracked across Europe prior to its arrival off [[Crimea]], but no warning was sent. As a result of this latter occurrence, several countries quickly launched independent meteorological services. In France, [[Urbain Le Verrier]], Director of the Observatoire de Paris, was commanded to set up a storm warning system; this later developed into an international meteorological service.&lt;ref&gt;Kutzbach, G., (1979) "[https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=bqXCDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA68&amp;lpg=PA68&amp;dq=Great+Storm+of+1854+landsberg&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xYFHmcBfQQ&amp;sig=USkHVTXa1puAhGTXoRkV_BoH5pM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi0lsCjmKvcAhVBX5QKHZ8bAFUQ6AEIXDAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Great%20Storm%20of%201854%20landsberg&amp;f=false The thermal theory of cyclones]," Boston, MA:''American Meteorological Society''. p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though it is impossible to precisely calculate the strength or speed of the wind, estimates have placed it around force 11 on the [[Beaufort Scale]].&lt;ref name="Lindgren"/&gt;

'''Hexamethylenetetramine''' or '''methenamine''', also known as '''urotropin''', is a [[heterocycle|heterocyclic organic compound]] with the formula (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.  This white [[crystal]]line compound is highly soluble in water and polar organic solvents.  It has a cage-like structure similar to [[adamantane]].  It is useful in the synthesis of other chemical compounds, e.g., plastics, pharmaceuticals, rubber additives.  It [[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublimes]] in vacuum at 280&amp;nbsp;°C.

==Synthesis, structure, reactivity==
Hexamethylenetetramine was discovered by [[Aleksandr Butlerov]] in 1859.&lt;ref name="Butlerow1859"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NYs8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA242#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Ueber einige Derivate des Jodmethylens | author=Butlerow, A. | journal=[[Liebigs Annalen|Ann. Chem. Pharm.]] | year=1859 | volume=111 | issue=2 | pages=242–252 | language=German | doi=10.1002/jlac.18591110219 | trans-title=On some derivatives of methylene iodide}} In this paper, Butlerov  discovered formaldehyde, which he called "Dioxymethylen" (methylene dioxide) [page 247] because his empirical formula for it was incorrect (C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).  On pages 249–250, he describes treating formaldehyde with ammonia gas, creating hexamine.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Butlerow1860"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=14lKAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA322#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Ueber ein neues Methylenderivat | author=Butlerow, A. | journal=Ann.

It is prepared industrially by combining [[formaldehyde]] and [[ammonia]].&lt;ref name="Ullmann"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Amines, Aliphatic | encyclopedia=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry | publisher=Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH | year=2000 | isbn=9783527306732 | doi=10.1002/14356007.a02_001 | last1=Eller | last2=Henkes | last3=Rossbacher | last4=Höke | first1=K. | first2=E. | first3=R. | first4=H.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reaction can be conducted in gas phase and in solution.

[[File:Synthesis Hexamine.svg|350px|center]]

The molecule has a symmetric [[tetrahedron|tetrahedral]] cage-like structure, similar to [[adamantane]], whose four "corners" are [[nitrogen]] atoms and "edges" are [[methylene bridge]]s. Although the molecular shape defines a cage, no void space is available at the interior for binding other atoms or molecules, unlike [[crown ether]]s or larger [[cryptand]] structures.

The molecule behaves like an amine base, undergoing protonation and ''N''-[[alkylation]] (e.g. [[Quaternium-15]]).

==Applications==
The dominant use of hexamethylenetetramine is in the production of powdery or liquid preparations of [[phenolic resin]]s and phenolic [[resin]] moulding compounds, where it is added as a hardening component. These products are used as binders, e.g. in brake and clutch linings, abrasive products, non-woven textiles, formed parts produced by moulding processes, and fireproof materials.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

It has been proposed that hexamethylenetetramine could work as a molecular building block for self-assembled molecular crystals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Markle|first1=R. C.|title=Molecular building blocks and development strategies for molecular nanotechnology|journal=Nanotechnology|date=2000|volume=11|page=89|doi=10.1088/0957-4484/11/2/309}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garcia|first1=J. C.|last2=Justo|first2=J. F.|last3=Machado|first3=W. V. M.|last4=Assali|first4=L. V. C.|title=Functionalized adamantane: building blocks for nanostructure self-assembly|journal=Phys. Rev. B|date=2009|volume=80|page=125421|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.80.125421}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical uses===
As the [[mandelic acid]] salt (generic methenamine mandelate, USP&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.methenaminemandelate.com/ | title = Methenamine mandelate, USP | publisher = Edenbridge Pharmaceuticals}}&lt;/ref&gt;) it is used for the treatment of urinary tract infection.  It decomposes at an acidic pH to form [[formaldehyde]] and [[ammonia]], and the formaldehyde is bactericidal; the mandelic acid adds to this effect. Urinary acidity is typically ensured by co-administering vitamin C ([[ascorbic acid]]) or [[ammonium chloride]]. Its use had temporarily been reduced in the late 1990s, due to adverse effects, particularly chemically-induced [[hemorrhagic cystitis]] in overdose,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1=R. R. | last1=Ross | title=Hemorrhagic cystitis following accidental overdose of methenamine mandelate | last2=Conway | first2=G. F. | journal=Am. J. Dis. Child. | year=1970 | volume=119 | issue=1 | pages=86–87 | doi=10.1001/archpedi.1970.02100050088021 | pmid=5410299}}&lt;/ref&gt; but its use has now been re-approved because of the prevalence of [[antibiotic resistance]] to more commonly used drugs. This drug is particularly suitable for long-term prophylactic treatment of urinary tract infection, because bacteria do not develop resistance to formaldehyde. It should not be used in the presence of renal insufficiency.

Methenamine in the form of cream and spray is successfully used for treatment of excessive sweating and concomitant odor.{{medcn|date=March 2018}}

===Histological stains===
[[Methenamine silver stain]]s are used for [[staining]] in [[histology]], including the following types:
*[[Grocott's methenamine silver stain]], used widely as a screen for [[fungi|fungal]] [[microorganisms|organism]]s.
*[[Jones' stain]], a methenamine silver-[[Periodic acid-Schiff]] that stains for [[basement membrane]], availing to view the "spiked" [[Glomerular basement membrane]] associated with [[membranous glomerulonephritis]].

===Solid fuel===
Together with [[1,3,5-trioxane]], hexamethylenetetramine is a component of [[hexamine fuel tablet]]s used by campers, hobbyists, the military and relief organizations for heating camping food or military rations.  It burns smokelessly, has a high [[Heat of combustion|energy density]] of 30.0 [[joule|megajoules]] per [[kilogram]] (MJ/kg), does not liquify while burning, and leaves no ashes, although its fumes are toxic.

Standardized 0.149&amp;nbsp;[[gram|g]] tablets of methenamine (hexamine) are used by fire-protection laboratories as a clean and reproducible fire source to test the flammability of carpets and rugs.&lt;ref name="schon"/&gt;

===Food additive===
Hexamethylene tetramine or hexamine is also used as a [[food additive]] as a preservative (INS number 239). It is approved for usage for this purpose in the EU,&lt;ref&gt;UK Food Standards Agency: {{cite web |url=http://www.food.gov.uk/safereating/chemsafe/additivesbranch/enumberlist |title=Current EU approved additives and their E Numbers |accessdate=2011-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it is listed under [[E number]] E239, however it is not approved in the USA, Russia, Australia, or New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code{{cite web |url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2011C00827 |title=Standard 1.2.4 - Labelling of ingredients |accessdate=2011-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reagent in organic chemistry===
Hexamethylenetetramine is a versatile [[reagent]] in [[organic synthesis]].&lt;ref name="Blazzevic1979"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Hexamethylenetetramine, A Versatile Reagent in Organic Synthesis | author=Blažzević, N. | journal=[[Synthesis (journal)|Synthesis]] | year=1979 | volume=1979 | issue=3 | pages=161–176 | doi=10.1055/s-1979-28602 | author2=Kolbah, D. | author3=Belin, B. | author4=Šunjić, V. | author5=Kajfež, F.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in the [[Duff reaction]] (formylation of arenes),&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth | author = Allen, C. F. H.; Leubne, G. W. | title = Syringic Aldehyde| volume = 31 | pages = 92 | year = 1951 | prep = CV4P0866 |doi = 10.15227/orgsyn.031.0092}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Sommelet reaction]] (converting benzyl halides to aldehydes),&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth | author = Wiberg, K. B. | title = 2-Thiophenaldehyde| collvol = 3 | collvolpages = 811| year = 1963 | prep = CV3P0811 |doi = 10.15227/orgsyn.000.0000}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[Delepine reaction]] (synthesis of amines from alkyl halides).&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth | author = Bottini, A. T.; Dev, V.; Klinck, J. | title = 2-Bromoallylamine| volume = 43 | pages = 6| year = 1963 | prep = CV5P0121 | doi=10.15227/orgsyn.043.0006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Explosives===
Hexamethylenetetramine is the base component to  produce [[RDX]] and, consequently, [[C-4 (explosive)|C-4]]&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt; as well as [[HMX|Octogen]], hexamine dinitrate and [[Hexamethylene triperoxide diamine|HMTD]].

== Historical uses ==
Hexamethylenetetramine was first introduced into the medical setting in 1899 as a urinary [[antiseptic]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heathcote|first1=Reginald St. A.|title=HEXAMINE AS AN URINARY ANTISEPTIC: I. ITS RATE OF HYDROLYSIS AT DIFFERENT HYDROGEN ION CONCENTRATIONS. II. ITS ANTISEPTIC POWER AGAINST VARIOUS BACTERIA IN URINE|journal=British Journal of Urology|volume=7|issue=1|year=1935|pages=9–32|issn=0007-1331|doi=10.1111/j.1464-410X.1935.tb11265.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was only used in cases of acidic urine, whereas boric acid was used to treat urinary tract infections with [[Alkalinity|alkaline]] urine.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = On Urinary Antiseptics|last = Elliot|first = |date = 1913|journal = British Medical Journal|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |volume = 98|pages = 685–686}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientist De Eds found that there was a direct correlation between the acidity of hexamethylenetetramine's environment and the rate of its decomposition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Therefore, its effectiveness as a drug depended greatly on the acidity of the urine rather than the amount of the drug administered.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In an alkaline environment, hexamethylenetetramine was found to be almost completely inactive.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Hexamethylenetetramine was also used as a method of treatment for soldiers exposed to [[phosgene]] in [[World War I]]. Subsequent studies have shown that large doses of hexamethylenetetramine provide some protection if taken before phosgene exposure but none if taken afterwards.&lt;ref name="Diller1980"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Diller|first1=Werner F.|title=The methenamine misunderstanding in the therapy of phosgene poisoning (review article)|journal=Archives of Toxicology|volume=46|issue=3-4|year=1980|pages=199–206|issn=0340-5761|doi=10.1007/BF00310435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Producers==
Since 1990 the number of European producers has been declining. The French SNPE factory closed in 1990; in 1993, the production of hexamethylenetetramine in [[Leuna]], Germany ceased; in 1996, the Italian facility of Agrolinz closed down; in 2001, the UK producer [[Borden (company)|Borden]] closed;  in 2006, production at Chemko, Slovak Republic, was closed. Remaining producers include INEOS in Germany, Caldic in the Netherlands, and [[Hexion]] in Italy. In the US, [[Eli Lilly and Company]] stopped producing methenamine tablets in 2002.&lt;ref name="schon"&gt;Alan H. Schoen (2004), [http://www.cpsc.gov/BUSINFO/methtabs.pdf ''Re: Equialence of methenamine Tablets Standard for Flammability of Carpets and Rugs''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005165422/https://www.cpsc.gov/businfo/methtabs.pdf |date=2008-10-05 }}. U.S. Consumer product Safety Commission, Washington, DC, July 29, 2004. Many other countries who still produce this include Russia, Saudi Arabia, China and Australia.&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, Hexamine Tablets for fuel are made by Thales Australia Ltd. In México, Hexamine is produced by Abiya.

In [[biogeography]], a [[species]] is '''indigenous''' to a given region or [[ecosystem]] if its presence in that region is the result of only natural processes, with no human intervention.&lt;ref name="CEQ2"&gt;CEQ (1999). [https://web.archive.org/web/20080515154626/http://ceq.eh.doe.gov/nepa/regs/eos/eo13112.html Executive Order 13112] &lt;/ref&gt; The term is equivalent to ''native'' in less scientific usage. Every wild organism (as opposed to a [[domestication|domesticated]] organism) has its own natural range of distribution in which it is regarded as indigenous. Outside this native range, a species may be introduced by human activity, either intentionally or unintentionally; it is then referred to as an ''[[introduced species]]'' within the regions where it was [[Human impact on the environment#anthropogenic |anthropogenically]] introduced.&lt;ref name="IntroducedDS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduced species|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/introduced_species.htm|website=Science Daily|accessdate=26 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of 'indigenous' is of necessity a blurred concept, and is clearly a function of both time and political boundaries. Seen over long periods of time, plants take part in the constant movement of tectonic plates - species appear and may flourish, endure or become extinct, but their distribution is never static or confined to a particular geographic location.

An indigenous species is not necessarily [[endemism|endemic]]. In biology and ecology, endemic means ''exclusively'' native to the [[biota (ecology)|biota]] of a specific place. An indigenous species may occur in areas other than the one under consideration.

The terms ''endemic'' and ''indigenous'' do not imply that an organism necessarily originated or [[evolution|evolved]] from where it is found.

'''Linolenic acid''' is a type of [[fatty acid]]. It can refer to either of two [[octadecatrienoic acid]]s (i.e. with an 18-carbon chain and three double bonds, which are found in the ''[[Cis-trans isomerism|cis]]'' configuration), or a mixture of the two.  [[Linolenate]] (in the form of [[triglyceride]] esters of linolenic acid) is often found in vegetable oils; traditionally, such fatty acylates are reported as the fatty acids:

*[[alpha-Linolenic acid|α-Linolenic acid]], an [[omega-3 fatty acid|omega-3]] (n-3) fatty acid
*[[gamma-Linolenic acid|γ-Linolenic acid]], an [[omega-6 fatty acid|omega-6]] (n-6) fatty acid
*[[beta-Linolenic acid|β-Linolenic acid]]
*[[delta-Linolenic acid|δ-Linolenic acid]]

From 1884 to 2007, there were 46 tornadoes with school fatalities in the United States. These tornadoes killed 286 (not including the 9 from the probable downburst in New York state). [[Tornado warning]]s began being issued in 1950 (and [[tornado watch]]es in late 1952);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Galway |first = Joseph G. |authorlink = Joseph G.

Two high fatality events after 1953 occurred in Mississippi (23 in 1955) and Illinois (13 in 1967); accounting for 82% of 1952-2006 deaths, both from [[Fujita scale#Rating classifications|violent class]] tornadoes.

More tornadoes with deaths in schools have occurred in the [[Southeastern United States]]—23 events or over half the national total—than any other region. Four of the top ten death toll events occurred in the Southeast. Relatively few school fatality tornado events have occurred in the area with the highest frequency of strong tornadoes, the [[Great Plains]] ([[Tornado Alley]]); only a single event occurred after warnings began being issued. This is probably chiefly due to three reasons: the low population density, greater tornado awareness (and better visibility affording more warning), and the time of year and of day that most tornadoes strike the Great Plains.&lt;ref name="fatality patterns"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Ashley |first= Walker S. |title= Spatial and Temporal Analysis of Tornado Fatalities in the United States: 1880–2005 |journal= Weather Forecast. |volume= 22 |issue= 6 |pages= 1214–28 |year= 2007 |doi= 10.1175/2007WAF2007004.1 |bibcode = 2007WtFor..22.1214A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Kenny |first = Tim |title = Tornado Deaths by Census Region, 1680-1999 |journal = Stormtrack |volume = 24 |issue = 1 |pages = 10 |date = 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Artists school tornado.jpg|thumb|left|An artist's conception of the April 21, 1967, school tornado disaster.]]

The state with the most tornado deaths throughout history is Illinois, with 90. The largest school death toll from a tornado was 69 during the [[Tri-State Tornado]], which also struck Illinois and significantly raised that state's death toll. The greatest death toll at a single school also occurred during the Tri-State tornado, when it killed 33 at a school in [[De Soto, Illinois|De Soto]], also in Illinois. This tornado also injured hundreds more at schools, and killed many students returning home from schools. Additionally, three of the top ten events by death toll, and four if separate schools of the same tornado are counted (33 in De Soto and 25 in [[Murphysboro, Illinois|Murphysboro]] again from the Tri-State Tornado), have occurred in Illinois.

The state with the highest number of tornadoes with deaths at schools is Alabama at 8 events. Illinois is second with 6 tornadoes. Missouri and Oklahoma are tied for third with 5 tornadoes. Fifth is Georgia with 3 tornadoes. Sixth are Texas, Tennessee, Indiana, Nebraska, Mississippi, and Arkansas, each with 2 events. One school fatality tornado event has occurred in Ohio, Louisiana, Iowa, Colorado, Kansas, South Carolina, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Minnesota, and Florida (the probable downburst in New York is not included).

[[File:LEMI405.jpg|thumb|Magnetotelluric station]]
'''Magnetotellurics''' ('''MT''') is an [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] [[geophysics|geophysical]] method for inferring the [[earth]]'s subsurface electrical conductivity from measurements of natural geomagnetic and geoelectric field variation at the Earth's surface. Investigation depth ranges from 300&amp;nbsp;m below ground by recording higher frequencies down to 10,000&amp;nbsp;m or deeper with long-period soundings. Proposed in Japan in the 1940s, and France and the USSR during the early 1950s, MT is now an international academic discipline and is used in exploration surveys around the world. Commercial uses include [[hydrocarbon]] (oil and gas) exploration, [[geothermal]] exploration, carbon sequestration, mining exploration, as well as [[hydrocarbon]] and [[groundwater]] monitoring. Research applications include experimentation to further develop the MT technique, long-period deep crustal exploration, deep mantle probing, and earthquake precursor prediction research.

== History ==

The magnetotelluric technique was introduced independently by Japanese scientists in the 1940s (Hirayama, Rikitake),  and [[Russia]]n geophysicist [[Andrey Nikolayevich Tikhonov]] in 1950&lt;ref&gt;Tikhonov, A.N., 1950. in 1953 On determining electrical characteristics of the deep layers of the Earth's crust, Doklady, 73, 295-297.&lt;/ref&gt; and the French geophysicist Louis Cagniard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cagniard | first1 = L | year = 1953 | title = Basic theory of the magneto-telluric method of geophysical prospecting | url = | journal = Geophysics | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 605–635 | doi=10.1190/1.1437915| bibcode = 1953Geop...18..605C}}&lt;/ref&gt; With advances in instrumentation, processing and modelling, MT has become one of the most important tools in deep Earth research.

Since first being created in the 1950s, magnetotelluric sensors, receivers and data processing techniques have followed the general trends in electronics, becoming less expensive and more capable with each generation. Major advances in MT instrumentation and technique include the shift from analog to digital hardware, the advent of remote referencing, GPS time-based synchronization, and 3D data acquisition and processing.

== Commercial applications ==

=== Hydrocarbon exploration ===
For [[hydrocarbon exploration]], MT is mainly used as a complement to the primary technique of [[reflection seismology]] exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hagi.or.id/download/JGeofisika/2004_2/2004_2_3.pdf |accessdate=26 November 2009 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-geo.phys.ualberta.ca/~unsworth/papers/2005-CSEG-recorder-unsworth-apr05_07.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060517135421/http://www-geo.phys.ualberta.ca/~unsworth/papers/2005-CSEG-recorder-unsworth-apr05_07.pdf |archivedate=17 May 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&amp;id=LEEDFF000025000004000438000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;gifs=yes&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kmstechnologies.com/Files/MT_for_Oil__and_Gas_Exploration_2008_FINAL_10.17.08.pdf |title=Geothermal Exploration with Electromagnetic Methods |format=PDF |accessdate=18 October 2011|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; While seismic imaging is able to image subsurface structure, it cannot detect the changes in resistivity associated with hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon-bearing formations. MT does detect [[resistivity]] variations in subsurface structures, which can differentiate between structures bearing hydrocarbons and those that do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phoenix-geophysics.com/applications/oil_and_gas/ |title=Oil and Gas exploration |publisher=Phoenix-geophysics.com |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a basic level of interpretation, [[resistivity]] is correlated with different rock types. High-velocity layers are typically highly resistive, whereas [[sediments]] – porous and permeable – are typically much less resistive. While high-velocity layers are an acoustic barrier and make seismic ineffective, their electrical resistivity means the magnetic signal passes through almost unimpeded. This allows MT to see deep beneath these acoustic barrier layers, complementing the seismic data and assisting interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publish.csiro.au/paper/EG991375.htm |title=CSIRO PUBLISHING – Exploration Geophysics |publisher=Publish.csiro.au |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  3-D MT survey results in Uzbekistan (32 x 32 grid of soundings) have guided further seismic mapping of a large known gas-bearing formation with complex subsurface geology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phoenix-geophysics.com/news/newsletter/?&amp;issue=47&amp;article=427 |title=3-D MT SURVEY IN UZBEKISTAN |publisher=Phoenix-geophysics.com |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publish.csiro.au/paper/ASEG2003ab054.htm |title=CSIRO PUBLISHING – ASEG Extended Abstracts |publisher=Publish.csiro.au |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mining exploration ===

MT is used for various [[base metals]] (nickel and [[precious metals]] exploration, as well as for [[kimberlite]]) mapping.

[[Vale Inco|INCO]]'s 1991 proof-of-concept study in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], Ontario, Canada  sensed a 1750-meter-deep nickel deposit. [[Falconbridge Ltd.|Falconbridge]] followed with a feasibility study in 1996 that accurately located two Ni-Cu mineralized zones at about 800 m and 1350 m depth. Since then, both major and junior mining companies are increasingly using MT and [[#Audio-magnetotellurics|audio-magnetotellurics]] (AMT) for both brownfields and greenfields exploration. Significant MT mapping work has been done on areas of the [[Canadian Shield]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.terrapub.co.jp/journals/EPS/pdf/2002/5405/54050575.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Diamond exploration, by detecting kimberlites, is also a proven application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepages.dias.ie/~ajones/PowerPoint_Presentations/kimberlite/sld001.htm |title=Imaging the geometry and structure of kimberlite pipes using audio-MT |publisher=Homepages.dias.ie |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research applications ==

===Crustal research===

MT has been used to investigate the distribution of [[magma|silicate melts]] in the [[Earth's mantle]] and crust; large investigations have focused on the continental US (National Science Foundation [[EarthScope]] MT Program), the [[East Pacific Rise]] and the [[Tibetan Plateau]]. Other research work aims to better understand the plate-tectonic processes in the highly complex three-dimensional region formed by the collision of the African and European plates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geophysics.dias.ie/projects/PICASSO/data/Schmoldt-Extended_abstract_final+.pdf|title=PICASSO- Phase I: MT Investigation of the Betic-Rif mountain system.

==Theory and practice==

===Energy sources===
[[Solar energy]] and [[lightning]] cause natural variations in the [[earth's magnetic field]], inducing electric currents (known as [[telluric current]]s) under the Earth's surface.'''&lt;ref&gt;Cantwell, T. (1960) ''Detection and Analysis of Low-Frequency Magnetotelluric Signals'', PhD Thesis, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts&lt;/ref&gt; A subsurface [[resistivity]] model is then created using this [[tensor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&amp;id=GPYSA7000018000003000605000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;gifs=yes&amp;ref=no |title=Basic Theory Of The Magneto-Telluric Method Of Geophysical Prospecting |publisher=Scitation.aip.org |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different rocks, sediments and geological structures have a wide range of different [[Electrical conductivity|electrical conductivities]].  Measuring electrical resistivity allows different materials and structures to be distinguished from one another and can improve knowledge of [[tectonic]] processes and [[geology|geologic]] structures.

The Earth's naturally varying electric and [[Earth's magnetic field|magnetic fields]] are measured over a wide range of magnetotelluric frequencies from 10,000&amp;nbsp;Hz to 0.0001&amp;nbsp;Hz (10,000&amp;nbsp;s). These fields are due to electric currents flowing in the Earth and the magnetic fields that induce these currents. The magnetic fields are produced mainly by the interaction between the [[solar wind]] and the [[magnetosphere]]. In addition, worldwide [[thunderstorm]] activity causes magnetic fields at frequencies above 1&amp;nbsp;Hz. Combined, these natural phenomena create strong MT source signals over the entire frequency spectrum.

The ratio of the electric field to magnetic field provides simple information about subsurface conductivity. Because the [[skin effect]] phenomenon affects the [[electromagnetic field]]s, the ratio at higher frequency ranges gives information on the shallow Earth, whereas deeper information is provided by the low-frequency range.  The ratio is usually represented as both apparent resistivity as a function of frequency and phase as a function of frequency.

===Depth and resolution===
MT measurements can investigate depths from about 300&amp;nbsp;m down to hundreds of kilometers, though investigations in the range of 500&amp;nbsp;m to 10,000&amp;nbsp;m are typical. Greater depth requires measuring lower frequencies, which in turn requires longer recording times. Very deep, very long-period measurements (mid-crust through upper mantle depths), may require recordings of several days to weeks or more to obtain satisfactory data quality.

Horizontal resolution of MT mainly depends on the distance between sounding locations- closer sounding locations increase the horizontal resolution. Continuous profiling (known as Emap) has been used, with only meters between the edges of each telluric dipole.

Vertical resolution of MT mainly depends on the frequency being measured, as lower frequencies have greater depths of penetration. Accordingly, vertical resolution decreases as depth of investigation increases.

===Signal strength and recording times===
Magnetic fields in the frequency range of 1&amp;nbsp;Hz to approximately 20&amp;nbsp;kHz are part of the audio-magnetotelluric (AMT) range.  These are parallel to the Earth surface and move towards the Earth's centre.  This large frequency band allows for a range of depth penetration from several metres to several kilometres below the Earth's surface.  Due to the nature of magnetotelluric source, the waves generally fluctuate in amplitude height.  Long recording times are needed to ascertain usable reading due to the fluctuations and the low signal strength.  Generally, the signal is weak between 1 and 5&amp;nbsp;kHz, which is a crucial range in detecting the top 100&amp;nbsp;m of geology. The magnetotelluric method is also used in marine environments for [[hydrocarbon]] exploration and lithospheric studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marineemlab.ucsd.edu/ |title=Marine EM laboratory |publisher=Scripps Institution of Oceanography |date=23 April 2010 |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the screening effect of the electrically conductive sea water, a usable upper limit of the spectrum is around 1&amp;nbsp;Hz.

===2D and 3D Magnetotellurics===
Two-dimensional surveys consist of a longitudinal profile of MT soundings over the area of interest, providing  two-dimensional "slices" of subsurface resistivity.

Three-dimensional surveys consist of a loose grid pattern of MT soundings over the area of interest, providing a more sophisticated three-dimensional model of subsurface resistivity.

== Variants ==

===Audio-magnetotellurics===
Audio-magnetotellurics (AMT) is a higher-frequency magnetotelluric technique for shallower investigations. While AMT has less depth penetration than MT, AMT measurements often take only about one hour to perform (but deep AMT measurements during low-signal strength periods may take up to 24 hours) and use smaller and lighter magnetic sensors. Transient AMT is an AMT variant that records only temporarily during periods of more intense natural signal (transient impulses), improving signal-to-noise-ratio at the expense of strong linear polarization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.empulse.ca/whatis.html |title=EMpulse Geophysics – Saskatoon |publisher=Empulse.ca |accessdate=18 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827003007/http://www.empulse.ca/whatis.html |archivedate=27 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Controlled source electromagnetics ===
CSEM [[Controlled source electro-magnetic]] is a deep-water [[Offshore (hydrocarbons)|offshore]] variant of controlled source audio magnetotellurics; CSEM is the name used in the offshore oil and gas industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marineemlab.ucsd.edu/resources/concepts/CSEM_MT.html |publisher=Scripps Institution of Oceanography |title= Research &amp;#124; Concepts &amp;#124;CSEM and MT Exploration for Petroleum |date=6 May 2009 |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Onshore CSEM / CSAMT may be effective where electromagnetic cultural noise (e.g. power lines, electric fences) present interference problems for natural-source geophysical methods.  An extensive grounded wire (2&amp;nbsp;km or more) has currents at a range of frequencies (0.1&amp;nbsp;Hz to 100&amp;nbsp;kHz) passed through it.  The electric field parallel to the source and the magnetic field which is at right angles are measured.  The resistivity is then calculated, and  the lower the resistivity, the more likely there is a conductive target (graphite, nickel ore or iron ore). CSAMT is also known in the oil and gas industry as Onshore Controlled Source ElectroMagnetics (Onshore CSEM).

An offshore variant of MT, the marine magnetotelluric (MMT) method, uses instruments and sensors in pressure housings deployed by ship into shallow coastal areas where water is less than 300&amp;nbsp;m deep.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://marineemlab.ucsd.edu/resources/Pubs/MarineMTpart1.pdf|title=Marine magnetotellurics for petroleum exploration Part I: A sea-floor equipment system|journal=Geophysics|last=Constable|first=Stephen|displayauthors=etal|doi=10.1190/1.1444393|bibcode=1998Geop...63..816C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marineemlab.ucsd.edu/Projects/Gemini/index.html |title=Gemini Prospect Marine MT and CSEM Surveys |publisher=Marineemlab.ucsd.edu |date=6 May 2009 |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phoenix-geophysics.com/news/newsletter/?&amp;issue=34 |title=Marine Mt In China With Phoenix Equipment |publisher=Phoenix-geophysics.com |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.westerngeco.com/services/electromagnetics/mmt.aspx |title=Integrated Electromagnetic Services, WesternGeco |publisher=Westerngeco.com |accessdate=18 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030161422/http://www.westerngeco.com/services/electromagnetics/mmt.aspx |archivedate=30 October 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A derivative of MMT is offshore single-channel measurement of the vertical [[magnetic field]] only (the Hz, or "tipper"), which eliminates the need for telluric measurements and horizontal magnetic measurements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/pctdb/en/wo.jsp?wo=2007079562 |title=CA2006000042 DETECTION OF RESISTIVITY OF OFFSHORE SEISMIC STRUCTURES MAINLY USING VERTICAL MAGNETIC COMPONENT OF EARTH'S NATURALLY VARYING ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD |publisher=Wipo.int |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the theory is sound and many case histories exist,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Exploration with Deep Transient Elctromagnetics|last=Strack|first=Kurt|publisher=Elsevier|year=1992|isbn=0444895418|location=|pages=|via=copyright released versions at: http://www.kmstechnologies.com/Files/Technology_Library/Publications/Exploration_with_Deep_Transient_Electromagnetics/Introduction_w_cover.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Exploration with controlled-source electromagnetics under basalt cover in India|journal=The Leading Edge|volume=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; no commercial systems are available by KMS Technologies.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kmstechnologies.com/|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=www.kmstechnologies.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, any such system would require a solution providing for the precise orientation and stabilization of the magnetic sensor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phoenix-geophysics.com/news/newsletter/pdf/precision_measurement.pdf|title=PRECISION MEASUREMENT OF Hz IN MARINE MT|author=Leo Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exploration surveys ==
MT exploration surveys are done to acquire resistivity data which can be interpreted to create a model of the subsurface. Data is acquired at each sounding location for a period of time (overnight soundings are common), with physical spacing between soundings dependent on the target size and geometry, local terrain constraints and financial cost. Reconnaissance surveys can have spacings of several kilometres, while more detailed work can have 200&amp;nbsp;m spacings, or even adjacent soundings (dipole-to-dipole). 

The [[Health, Safety and Environment|HSE]] impact of MT exploration is relatively low because of light-weight equipment, natural signal sources, and reduced hazards compared to other types of exploration (e.g. no drills, no explosives, and no high currents).

=== Remote reference soundings ===
Remote Reference is an MT technique used to account for cultural electrical noise by acquiring simultaneous data at more than one MT station. This greatly improves data quality, and may allow acquisition in areas where the natural MT signal is difficult to detect because of man-made [[EM interference]].

=== Survey equipment ===
A typical full suite of MT equipment (for a "five component" sounding) consists of a receiver instrument with five [[sensors]]:  three [[magnetic]] sensors (typically induction coil sensors), and two [[telluric current|telluric]] (electric) sensors. For long-period MT (frequencies below approximately 1–10&amp;nbsp;Hz), the three discrete magnetic field sensors can typically be replaced with a single compact triaxial fluxgate magnetometer. In many situations, only the telluric sensors will be used, and magnetic data borrowed from other nearby soundings to reduce acquisition costs.

A complete five-component set of MT equipment can be backpack-carried by a small field team (2 to 4 persons) or carried by a light [[helicopter]] (such as the [[MD Helicopters MD 500]]), allowing deployment in remote and rugged areas. Most MT equipment is capable of reliable operation over a wide range of environmental conditions, with ratings of typically −25&amp;nbsp;°C to +55&amp;nbsp;°C, from dry desert to high-humidity (condensing) and temporary full immersion.

=== Data processing and interpretation ===
Post-acquisition processing is required to transform raw time-series data into frequency-based inversions. The resulting output of the processing program is used as the input for subsequent interpretation. Processing may include the use of remote reference data or local data only.

Processed MT data is modelled using various techniques to create a subsurface resistivity map, with lower frequencies generally corresponding to greater depth below ground. Anomalies such as [[fault (geology)|faults]], [[hydrocarbons]], and conductive mineralization appear as areas of higher or lower resistivity from surrounding structures. For interpretation(inversion) of magnetotelluric data a number of software are used (WinGlink, Geotools MT, ZondMT2D).

== Instrument and sensor manufacturers ==
MT instrumentation design and construction is a specialized international activity, with only a small number of  companies and scientific organizations having the necessary expertise and technology.  Three companies supply most of the commercial-use world market:  one in the United States,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Zonge International, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zonge.com/FieldAMT.html |title=Surveys &amp;#124; AMT and MT |publisher=Zonge |accessdate=18 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003125930/http://www.zonge.com/FieldAMT.html |archivedate=3 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;), one in Canada; Phoenix Geophysics, Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phoenix-geophysics.com/products/receivers/mtu/ |title=Phoenix products : The MTU Receiver |publisher=Phoenix-geophysics.com |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and one in Germany (Metronix Messgeraete und Elektronik GmbH).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geo-metronix.de/ |title= Metronix Geophysics : Technology for Geophysics and Magnetotellurics |publisher=Metronix}}&lt;/ref&gt;  High power CSEM array systems above 100 KVA for hydrocarbon and geothermal expploration are manufactured by KMS Technologies, USA.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Government agencies and smaller companies producing MT instrumentation for internal use include Vega Geophysics, Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vega-geophysics.com/ |title=Vega Geophysics Official Web Site |accessdate=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Russia and the Russian Academy of Sciences (SPbF [[IZMIRAN]]); and the [[Lviv Centre of Institute for Space Research|National Space Research Institute of Ukraine]].  Geometrics, Inc. of San Jose, California USA produces a high-frequency, hybrid-source AMT system combining both natural fields and a high-frequency (1 to 70&amp;nbsp;kHz) transmitter, as well as a multi-channel distributed network CSAMT instrument.

An '''omphalos''' is a religious stone [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]], or [[baetylus]]. In [[Ancient Greek]], the word {{lang|grc|[[wikt:ὀμφαλός|ὀμφᾰλός]]}} ({{transl|grc|omphalós}}) means "[[navel]]". In [[Greek mythology|Greek lore]], [[Zeus]] sent two eagles across the world to meet at its center, the "navel" of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Voegelin E. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zzvYIK_0GUEC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=omphalos&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2fhlU8ubHYf28QW7jIKAAg&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=omphalos&amp;f=false |title=Order and History, Volume 2|publisher= University of Missouri Press|date= 2000 |page=31 |isbn=9780826263933}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the Ancient Greeks, it was a widespread belief that Delphi was the center of the world. According to the myths regarding the founding of the Delphic Oracle, Zeus, in his attempt to locate the center of the earth, launched two eagles from the two ends of the world, and the eagles, starting simultaneously and flying at equal speed, crossed their paths above the area of Delphi, and so was the place where Zeus placed the stone. Omphalos is also the name of the stone given to [[Cronus]]. In the ancient world of the Mediterranean, it was a powerful religious symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Ciholas P. |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=rkPa3-bo_70C&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=omphalos&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2fhlU8ubHYf28QW7jIKAAg&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=omphalos&amp;f=false |title=The omphalos and the cross|publisher= Mercer University Press|date= 2003 |page=6|isbn= 9780865547834}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''Omphalos Syndrome'' refers to the belief that a place of geopolitical power and currency is the most important place in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Murphy C. |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=jhj47Y_dKJ0C&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=omphalos&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2fhlU8ubHYf28QW7jIKAAg&amp;ved=0CF8Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=omphalos&amp;f=false |title=Are We Rome?: The Fall of an Empire and the Fate of America|publisher= Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|date= 2007 |page=44|isbn=  9780618742226}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Winther, Rasmus Grønfeldt (2014) World Navels. ''Cartouche'' 89: 15-21 http://philpapers.org/archive/WINWN.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symbolism ==
The omphalos was not only an object of [[Hellenistic religion|Hellenic]] religious symbolism and world centrality; it was also considered an object of power. Its symbolic references included the [[uterus]], the [[phallus]], and a cup of red wine representing royal blood lines.

== Delphi ==
{{main article|Omphalos of Delphi}}
[[File:Omphalos museum.jpg|thumb|upright|The omphalos in museum of [[Delphi]].]]
Most accounts locate the Delphi omphalos in the [[adyton]] (sacred part of the temple) near the [[Pythia]] (oracle). The stone sculpture itself (which may be a copy), has a carving of a knotted net covering its surface, and a hollow center, widening towards the base. The omphalos represents the stone which [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]] wrapped in swaddling clothes, pretending it was Zeus, in order to deceive [[Cronus]]. (Cronus was the father who swallowed his children so as to prevent them from usurping him as he had deposed his own father, [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]]).

Omphalos stones were believed to allow direct communication with the gods. Holland (1933) suggested that the stone was hollow to allow intoxicating vapours breathed by the Oracle to channel through it. [[Erwin Rohde]] wrote that the [[Python (mythology)|Python]] at Delphi was an earth spirit, who was conquered by [[Apollo]] and buried under the Omphalos. However, understanding of the use of the omphalos is uncertain due to destruction of the site by [[Theodosius I]] and [[Arcadius]] in the 4th century CE.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

== Jerusalem ==
[[File:Пуп земли.jpg|thumb|upright|Omphalos in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]], [[Jerusalem]].]]
[[File:The rock of the Dome of the Rock Corrected.jpg|thumb|upright| [[Foundation Stone]] of the [[Jewish]] Temple, found in the [[Dome of the Rock]] mosque on the [[Temple Mount]], Jerusalem.]]

The omphalos at the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]], Jerusalem, represents, in Christian mediaeval tradition, the ''navel of the world''  (the spiritual and cosmological centre of the world).&lt;ref&gt;[[Ezekial]] 38,12, a homily on the phrase, ''the nations...that dwell in the middle of the earth''.&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish tradition held that God revealed himself to His people through the [[Ark of the Covenant]] in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], which rested on the [[Foundation stone]] marking the centre of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Tanhuma Buber, Kedoshim paragraph 10.&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition may have stemmed from the similar one at Delphi.  The omphalos has a collection box chained next to it. (See picture)

In literature, the word ''omphalos'' has held various meanings but usually refers to the stone at Delphi. Authors who have used the term include: [[Homer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:abo:tlg,0012,002:1:50&amp;lang=original|title=Homer,  Odyssey, Book 1, line 50|last=|first=|date=|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|access-date=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0136:book=1:card=44|title=Homer,  Odyssey, Book 1, line 50 ("navel")|last=|first=|date=|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|access-date=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [[D.H.

For example, Joyce uses the term in the novel, [[Ulysses (novel)|''Ulysses'']]:

'''Osmotrophy''' is the uptake of dissolved [[organic compound]]s by [[osmosis]] for nutrition. Organisms that use osmotrophy are '''osmotrophs'''. Some [[mixotrophic]] [[microorganism]]s use osmotrophy to derive [[energy]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}
The organisms that used osmotrophy are known to be an osmotrophs which are usually found in [[protist]]s and [[Fungus|fungi]] although exclusively osmotrophic feeding in contemporary ecosystems are restricted to microscopic [[bacteria]] thereby used the process of [[osmosis]] for the movement of food although some macroscopic animals like molluscs, sponges, corals, brachiopods and [[echinoderm]]s used osmotrophic feeding as a supplemental [[food]] source.

Osmotrophy is a means of gathering [[nutrient]]s in [[Microscopic scale|microscopic]] organisms that relies on cellular surface area to ensure that proper [[diffusion]] occurs throughout the [[Cell (biology)|cell]]. When [[organism]]s increase in size, the surface area per volume ratio drops and osmotrophy becomes insufficient to meet [[nutrient]] demands.

In stagnant waters photoautotrophs have a relative advantage over [[heterotroph]]ic osmotrophs since the flux of photons as an [[energy]] source are not hindered at low temperatures, thus it depend on [[diffusion]] for mass acquisition through [[Brownian motion|Brownian]] diffusion.

Fluid motion is important for osmotrophs because asymptotic [[Chemical reaction|reaction]]s occurs in the absence of fluid motion. Movement brings [[Cell (biology)|cell]] that correspond to the highest gradients though diffusional core is safe on average [[concentration]]s.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Many types of basal [[eukaryotes]], particularly [[Fungi]] and [[Protista]], are osmotrophic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Osmotrophy|title=Osmotrophy - Biology-Online Dictionary|website=www.biology-online.org|access-date=2016-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Example of these types of [[organism]]s are [[Cestoda|tapeworms]] and ''Trypanasoma''.

'''PTFE Structured Packing''' refers to a range of specially designed materials for use in [[absorption (chemistry)|absorption]] and [[Fractionating column|distillation columns]] and [[chemical reactor]]s. [http://reprap.org/wiki/PTFE PTFE] [[Structured packing]] typically consist of thin corrugated [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|PTFE Sheets]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PTFE Packing Materials|url= http://www.ptfepacking.net/|publisher=American Seal and Packing |work=ptfepacking.net|date=28 February 2015|accessdate=16 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; arranged in a way that they force [[fluid]]s to take complicated paths through the column, thereby creating a large surface area for contact between different [[Phase (matter)|phases]].

'''Panguite''' is a type of [[titanium]] [[oxide mineral]] first discovered as an [[Inclusion (mineral)|inclusion]] within the [[Allende meteorite]], and first described in [[2012 in science|2012]].&lt;ref name=eureka&gt;{{cite web | title=Caltech scientists find new primitive mineral in meteorite| work=Eurekalert| date= 26 June 2012 | url= http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2012-06/ciot-csf062612.php | accessdate=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/47970457/ns/technology_and_science-science/#.T-pWZnBygtE MSN]&lt;/ref&gt;

The hitherto unknown [[meteorite]] mineral was named for the ancient Chinese god [[Pan Gu]], the creator of the world through the separation of [[Yin and yang|yin]] (earth) from yang (sky).&lt;ref name=eureka /&gt;

==Composition==
The mineral’s [[chemical formula]] is (Ti&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;,Sc,Al,Mg,Zr,Ca)&lt;sub&gt;1.8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The elements found in it are [[titanium]], [[scandium]], [[aluminium]], [[magnesium]], [[zirconium]], [[calcium]], and [[oxygen]]. Samples from the meteorite include some which are zirconium rich. The mineral was found in conjunction with the already identified mineral [[davisite]], within an [[olivine]] [[Aggregate (geology)|aggregate]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/06/new-mineral-panguite/ Wired]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and properties==
Panguite is in a class of [[refractory]] minerals that formed under the high temperatures and extremely varied pressures present in the early [[solar system]], up to 4.5 billion years ago. This makes panguite one of the oldest minerals in the Solar System. Zirconium is a key element in determining conditions prior to and during the Solar System’s formation.

==Discovery==
Chi Ma, director of the Geological and Planetary Sciences division’s Analytical Facility at the [[California Institute of Technology]] was the lead author of its first peer-reviewed article, published in ''[[American Mineralogist]]''.&lt;ref name=AmMin&gt;[http://ammin.geoscienceworld.org/content/97/7/1219.full?ijkey=G2n1UMXmu7r4.&amp;keytype=ref&amp;siteid=gsammin Ma C. et al. 2012.

'''Plutonium(IV) fluoride''' is a chemical compound with the formula (PuF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).  Like all [[plutonium]] compounds, it is subject to control under the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]].

Metallic plutonium is produced by reacting plutonium tetrafluoride with barium, calcium, or lithium at 1200&amp;nbsp;°C:

:PuF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 Ba → 2 BaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + Pu
:PuF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 Ca → 2 CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + Pu
:PuF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 Li → 4 LiF + Pu

'''PowerBuoy''' is a [[power station]] for generating electrical energy from [[wave power]]. It is a point absorber or [[buoy]], currently in-use or in-planning at 9 locations around the world, but primarily within [[Wave power in Australia|Australia]] and the [[Wave power in the United States|United States]].&lt;ref name="NYT20100904"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/04/us/project-aims-to-harness-wave-energy-off-the-oregon-coast.html] New York Times September 4, 2012 &lt;/ref&gt; 

The PowerBuoy generates power using a hydroelectric turbine. PowerBuoys can be connected to the electrical grid by power transmission cables or can operate autonomously in a deep water environment. PowerBuoys are manufactured by [[Ocean Power Technologies]] (OPT) in [[Pennington, New Jersey]].

The rising and falling of the waves offshore causes the buoy to move freely up and down. The resultant mechanical stroking drives an electrical generator. The generated wave power is transmitted ashore via an underwater power cable.

An OPT power station benefits from a deep water emplacement and has a very low "surface profile", meaning it is barely visible from shore. They also have a small horizontal footprint and have been designed to be scalable. As such, they are ideal for [[wave farm]]s.

OPT power stations have been designed for extreme wave conditions. Sensors on the PowerBuoy continuously monitor the performance of the various subsystems and surrounding ocean environment. Data is transmitted to shore in real time. In the event of very large oncoming waves, the system automatically locks up and ceases power production. When the wave heights return to normal, the system unlocks and recommences energy conversion and transmission of the electrical power ashore.

A '''regenerative heat exchanger''', or more commonly a '''regenerator''', is a type of [[heat exchanger]] where heat from the hot fluid is intermittently stored in a thermal storage medium before it is transferred to the cold fluid. To accomplish this the hot fluid is brought into contact with the heat storage medium, then the fluid is displaced with the cold fluid, which absorbs the heat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thermopedia.com/content/1087/ Regenerative heat exchangers]&lt;/ref&gt;

In regenerative heat exchangers, the fluid on either side of the heat exchanger can be the same fluid. The fluid may go through an external processing step, and then it is flowed back through the heat exchanger in the opposite direction for further processing. Usually the application will use this process cyclically or repetitively.

Regenerative heating was one of the most important technologies developed during the [[Industrial Revolution]] when it was used in the [[hot blast]] process on [[blast furnace]]s,&lt;ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Carrie Furnace No. 7, U.S. Steel Homestead Works, Blast Furnace Plant, Along Monongahela River, Homestead (Allegheny County, Pennsylvania).jpg|thumb|right|Blast furnace (left), and three [[Cowper stove]]s (right) used to preheat the air blown into the furnace]]
The first regenerator was invented by Rev. [[Robert Stirling]] in 1816, and is commonly found as a component of his [[Stirling engine]]. The simplest Stirlings, and most models, use a less efficient but simpler to construct, ''displacer'' instead.

Later applications included the [[blast furnace]] process known as [[hot blast]] and the [[Open hearth furnace]] also called Siemens regenerative furnace (which was used for making glass), where the hot exhaust gases from combustion are passed through firebrick regenerative chambers, which are thus heated. The flow is then reversed, so that the heated bricks preheat the fuel.&lt;ref name="Gale 1967"&gt;W. K. V. Gale, ''British iron and steel industry'' (David and Charles, Newton Abbot 1967), 98–100.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Alfred Cowper]] applied the regeneration principle to blast furnaces, in the form of the "Cowper stove", patented in 1857.&lt;ref&gt;Bennet Woodcroft, 'Chronological Index of Patents Applied for and Patents Granted, for the Year 1857', Patent No.1404, 19 May 1857 https://books.google.com/books?id=zXMyAQAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=index+of+patents&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=A6cpU7vGKM3xhQef5ICIAg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=snippet&amp;q=edward%20alfred%20cowper&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; This is almost invariably used with blast furnaces to this day.&lt;ref name="Gale 1967"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. K. Hyde, ''Technological change and the British iron industry 1700–1870'' (Princeton University Press, 1977), 200–1.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of regenerators ==
{{Technical|section|date=April 2008}}

Regenerators exchange heat from one process fluid to an intermediate solid heat storage medium, then that medium exhanges heat with a second process fluid flow.  The two flows are either separated in time, alternately circulating through the storage medium, or are separated in space and the heat storage medium is moved between the two flows.

In '''rotary regenerators''' the heat storage "matrix" in the form of a wheel or drum,that rotates continuously through two counter-flowing streams of fluid. In this way, the two streams are mostly separated. Only one stream flows through each section of the matrix at a time; however, over the course of a rotation, both streams eventually flow through all sections of the matrix in succession. The heat storage medium can be a relatively fine-grained set of metal plates or wire mesh, made of some resistant alloy or coated to resist chemical attack by the process fluids, or made of ceramics in high temperature applications.  A large amount of heat transfer area can be provided in each unit volume of the rotary regenerator, compared to a shell-and-tube heat exchanger - up to 1000 square feet of surface can be contained in each cubic foot of regenerator matrix, compared to about 30 square feet in each cubic foot of a shell-and-tube exchanger.&lt;ref name=JMJ91&gt;John J. McKetta Jr (ed.), ''Heat Transfer Design Methods'',	CRC Press, 1991, {{ISBN|0849306655}}, pages 101-103&lt;/ref&gt;

Each portion of the matrix will be nearly [[isothermal]], since the rotation is perpendicular to both the temperature gradient and flow direction, and not through them. The two fluid streams flow counter-current. The fluid temperatures vary across the flow area; however the local stream temperatures are not a function of time. The seals between the two streams are not perfect, so some cross contamination will occur. The allowable pressure level of a roary regenerator is relatively low, compared to heat exchangers.

[[File:Ljungström Regenerative Heat Transmission Apparatus.jpg|thumb|right| Patent drawings for a rotary regenerator, illustrating the drum-shaped matrix and the seals that prevent mixing of the streams.]]
[[File:Ljungström regenerative heat exchanger.jpg|thumb|right| LjungströmRotary regenerator.]]

In a '''fixed matrix regenerator''', a single fluid stream has cyclical, reversible flow; it is said to flow "counter-current". This regenerator may be part of a [[valve]]less system, such as a [[Stirling engine]]. In another configuration, the fluid is ducted through valves to different matrices in alternate operating periods resulting in outlet temperatures that vary with time.  For example, a blast furnace may have several "stoves" or "checkers" full of refractory fire brick. The hot gas from the furnace is ducted through the brickwork for some interval, say one hour, until the brick reaches a high temperature. Valves then operate and switch the cold intake air through the brick, recovering the heat for use in the furnace. Practical installations will have multiple stoves and arrangements of valves to gradually transfer flow between a "hot" stove and an adjacent "cold" stove, so that the variations in the outlet air temperature are reduced.&lt;ref name=SS13&gt;Ramesh K. Shah, Dusan P. Sekulic ''Fundamentals of Heat Exchanger Design'',John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2003 {{ISBN|0471321710}}, page 55&lt;/ref&gt;

Another type of regenerator is called a '''micro scale regenerative heat exchanger'''. It has a multilayer grating structure in which each layer is offset from the adjacent layer by half a cell which has an opening along both axes perpendicular to the flow axis. Each layer is a composite structure of two sublayers, one of a high thermal conductivity material and another of a low thermal conductivity material. When a hot fluid flows through the cell, heat from the fluid is transferred to the cell wells, and stored there. When the fluid flow reverses direction, heat is transferred from the cell walls back to the fluid.

A third type of regenerator is called a "''Rothemuhle''" regenerator. This type has a fixed matrix in a disk shape, and streams of fluid are ducted through rotating hoods. The ''Rothemuhle'' regenerator is used as an air preheater in some power generating plants. The thermal design of this regenerator is the same as of other types of regenerators. {{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

===Biology===
We use our nose and throat as a regenerative heat exchanger when we breathe. The cooler air coming in is warmed, so that it reaches the lungs as warm air. On the way back out, this warmed air deposits much of its heat back onto the sides of the nasal passages, so that these passages are then ready to warm the next batch of air coming in. Some animals, including humans, have curled sheets of bone inside the nose called [[Nasal concha|nasal turbinates]] to increase the surface area for heat exchange.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===Cryogenics===
Regenerative heat exchangers are made up of materials with high volumetric [[heat capacity]] and low [[thermal conductivity]] in the longitudinal (flow) direction. At [[cryogenic]] (very low) temperatures around 20 [[Kelvin|K]], the specific heat of metals is low, and so a regenerator must be larger for a given heat load.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

== Advantages of regenerators ==
The advantages of a regenerator over a recuperating (counter-flowing) heat exchanger is that it has a much higher surface area for a given volume, which provides a reduced exchanger volume for a given energy density, effectiveness and pressure drop. This makes a regenerator more economical in terms of materials and manufacturing, compared to an equivalent recuperator.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The design of inlet and outlet headers used to distribute hot and cold fluids in the matrix is much simpler in counter flow regenerators than recuperators. The reason behind this is that both streams flow in different sections for a rotary regenerator and one fluid enters and leaves one matrix at a time in a fixed-matrix regenerator. Furthermore, flow sectors for hot and cold fluids in rotary regenerators can be designed to optimize pressure drop in the fluids. The matrix surfaces of regenerators also have self-cleaning characteristics, reducing fluid-side fouling and corrosion. Finally properties such as small surface density and counter-flow arrangement of regenerators make it ideal for gas-gas heat exchange applications requiring effectiveness exceeding 85%. The heat transfer coefficient is much lower for gases than for liquids, thus the enormous surface area in a regenerator greatly increases heat transfer.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

== Disadvantages of regenerators ==
The major disadvantage of rotary and fixed-matrix regenerators is that there is always some mixing of the fluid streams, and they can not be completely separated. There is an unavoidable carryover of a small fraction of one fluid stream into the other. In the rotary regenerator, the carryover fluid is trapped inside the radial seal and in the matrix, and in a fixed-matrix regenerator, the carryover fluid is the fluid that remains in the void volume of the matrix. This small fraction will mix with the other stream in the following half-cycle. Therefore, rotary and fixed-matrix regenerators are only used when it is acceptable for the two fluid streams to be mixed. Mixed flow is common for gas-to-gas heat and/or energy transfer applications, and less common in liquid or phase-changing fluids since fluid contamination is often prohibited with liquid flows.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The constant heating and cooling that takes place in regenerative heat exchangers puts a lot of stress on the components of the heat exchanger, which can cause cracking or breakdown of materials.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The '''Reventazón Dam''' is a [[concrete-face rock-fill dam]] on the [[Reventazón River]] about {{Convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of [[Siquirres]] in [[Limón Province]], [[Costa Rica]]. It was [[Inauguration|inaugurated]] on 16 September 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= View of the hydroelectric dam on the Reventazon River |url= http://www.gettyimages.at/detail/nachrichtenfoto/view-of-the-hydroelectric-dam-on-the-reventazon-river-nachrichtenfoto/606993636?#view-of-the-hydroelectric-dam-on-the-reventazon-river-in-siquirres-in-picture-id606993636 |publisher= Ezequiel Becerra |agency=AFP |accessdate= 17 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its primary purpose is the production of [[hydroelectric]] power.

At a height of {{Convert|130|m|ft}} and with a structural volume of {{Convert|9,000,000|m3|cuyd|abbr=on}}, it is the largest dam in [[Central America]]. To produce electricity, water from the reservoir is diverted about {{cvt|3|km}} to the northeast where it reaches the power station along the Reventazón River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Project of the Month |url= http://www.pedregal.co.cr/pgproyectomes.htm |publisher= Pedregal |accessdate= 20 December 2014 |language= Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rudnaya Pristan''' ({{lang-ru|Ру́дная При́стань}}, lit. ''[[Ore]] [[Wharf]]'') is a [[types of settlements in Russia|village]] (''[[village#Russia|selo]]'') located at the mouth of the [[Rudnaya River]], on the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast of [[Primorsky Krai]]. It is situated 35&amp;nbsp;km east of [[Dalnegorsk]] (also in [[Primorsky Krai]]) and approximately 514&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Vladivostok]]. Its population was 2,107 in 2010, 2,389 in 2002,&lt;ref&gt;([[Russian Census (2002)|2002 Census]])&lt;/ref&gt; and 2,947 in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;([[Soviet Census (1989)|1989 Census]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lead]] [[smelting]] has been the town's primary industry since a plant was built there in 1930. The plant has provided steady employment for most of the area's families since that time, but at enormous cost to both the health of the residents and the local environment. The residents suffer from many health problems, including an inordinately high rate of [[cancer]], and the soil has become heavily contaminated with lead-related by-products. The [[Blacksmith Institute]] consequently declared Rudnaya Pristan, along with [[Dalnegorsk]], one of the ten worst polluted places on earth,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blacksmithinstitute.org/site10j.php Website of Blacksmith Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; although [[Anatoly Lebedev]], leader of the ecological [[non-governmental organization|NGO]] ''BROK'', disputes this inclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Regnum New Agency. ''[http://www.regnum.ru/english/725071.html Ecologists of Primorye Territory (Russia) surprised at listing Rudnaya Pristan among the most polluted places in the world]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its coastal location, Rudnaya Pristan's harbor has remained largely undeveloped, and its [[climate]] is harsh, dominated in winter by the vast Siberian high-pressure system and in summer by remnants of the East Asian [[monsoon]]. This combination results in very cold, dry winters with generally high winds, and muggy summers that provide ideal conditions for the breeding of [[mosquito]]es.

[[File:Sharpeningstone1.jpg|thumb|right|An '''oil stone''']]

'''Sharpening stones''', '''water stones''' or '''whetstones''' are used to [[sharpening|sharpen]] the edges of steel tools and implements through [[grind]]ing and [[Honing (metalworking)|honing]].

Examples of items that can be sharpened with a sharpening stone include [[scissor]]s, [[scythe]]s, [[knife|knives]], [[straight razor|razors]], and tools such as [[chisel]]s, [[hand scraper]]s, and [[Plane (tool)|plane]] blades.

Sharpening stones come in a wide range of shapes, sizes, and material compositions. Stones may be flat, for working flat edges, or shaped for more complex edges, such as those associated with some [[wood carving]] or [[woodturning]] tools. They may be composed of natural quarried material, or from man-made material.

Stones are usually available in various grades, which refer to the [[Mesh (scale)|grit]] size of the abrasive particles in the stone. 
Grit size is given as a number, which indicates the spatial density of the particles. A higher number denotes a higher density and therefore smaller particles, which leads to a finer finish of the surface of the polished object.

==Terminology==
Though "whetstone" is often mistaken as a reference to the water sometimes used to lubricate such stones, the term is based on the word "whet", which means to sharpen a blade,&lt;ref name = "dictionary" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "etymonline" /&gt; not on the word "wet". The verb nowadays usually used to describe the process of using a sharpening stone is ''to sharpen'', but the older term ''to whet'' is still sometimes used. The term ''to stone'' is so rare in this sense that it is no longer mentioned in for example the Oxford Living Dictionaries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/stone#stone Oxford Living Dictionaries]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "dictionary2" /&gt; One of the most common mistaken idioms in English involves the phrase "to whet your appetite", too often mistakenly written as "to wet". But to "whet" quite appropriately means "to sharpen" one's appetite, not to douse it with water.

==Natural stones versus artificial stones==
The Roman historian Pliny described use of several naturally occurring stones for sharpening in his [[Natural History (Pliny)|''Natural History'']]. He describes the use of both oil and water stones and gives the locations of several ancient sources for these stones.&lt;ref name=Griswold&gt;Leon S. Griswold, ''The Novaculites of Arkansas'' in ''Annual Report of the Geological Survey of Arkansas, Volume 3'', 1892, available on Google Books&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of natural stone for sharpening has diminished with the widespread availability of high-quality, consistent particle size artificial stones.

As a result, the legendary Honyama mines in [[Kyoto]], Japan, have been closed since 1967. Belgium currently has only a single mine that is still quarrying Coticules and their Belgian Blue Whetstone (BBW) counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coticule.be/faq-reader/items/how-does-a-belgian-blue-whetstone-compare-to-a-coticule-40a-story-about-garnets41.html coticule.be]&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern [[Chemical synthesis|synthetic]] stones are generally of equal quality to natural stones, and are often considered superior in sharpening performance due to consistency of particle size and control over the properties of the stones. For example, the proportional content of abrasive particles as opposed to base or "binder" materials can be controlled to make the stone cut faster or slower, as desired.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last = English |first = John |title = Woodworker's Guide to Sharpening: All You Need to Know to Keep Your Tools Sharp |page = 22 |publisher = Fox Chapel Publishing |year = 2008 |url = https://sharppebble.com/collections/sharpening-stones |isbn = 978-1-56523-309-6 |postscript =.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural stones are often prized for their natural beauty as stones and their rarity, adding value as collectors' items. Furthermore, each natural stone is different, and there are rare natural stones that contain abrasive particles in grit sizes finer than are currently available in artificial stones. {{citation needed |date=March 2016}}

One of the most well-regarded natural whetstones is the yellow-gray "Belgian Coticule", which has been legendary for the edge it can give to blades since Roman times, and has been quarried for centuries from the [[Ardennes]]. The slightly coarser and more plentiful "Belgian Blue" whetstone is found naturally with the yellow coticule in adjacent strata; hence two-sided whetstones are available, with a naturally occurring seam between the yellow and blue layers. These are highly prized for their natural elegance and beauty, and for providing both a fast-cutting surface for establishing a bevel and a finer surface for refining it. This stone is considered one of the finest for sharpening [[straight razor]]s. {{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The hard stone of [[Charnwood Forest]] in northwest [[Leicestershire, England]], has been quarried for centuries,&lt;ref name="Exploring"&gt;Ambrose, K et al. (2007). ''Exploring the Landscape of Charnwood Forest and Mountsorrel''. Keyworth, Nottingham: British Geological Survey&lt;/ref&gt; and was a source of whetstones and [[quern-stone]]s.

==Whetstones and oilstones==
Whetstones may be natural or artificial stones. Artificial stones usually come in the form of a [[abrasive|bonded abrasive]] composed of a [[ceramic]] such as [[silicon carbide]] (carborundum) or of [[aluminium oxide]] (corundum). Bonded abrasives provide a faster cutting action than natural stones. They are commonly available as a double-sided block with a coarse grit on one side and a fine grit on the other enabling one stone to satisfy the basic requirements of sharpening. Some shapes are designed for specific purposes such as sharpening scythes, drills or serrations.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Bottorff, ''Sharpening Made Easy: A Primer on Sharpening Knives and Other Edged Tools'', Knife World Publications, 2002, {{ISBN|0940362198}}, pp.29-39&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural stones are typically formed of [[quartz]], such as [[novaculite]]. The [[Ouachita Mountains]] in [[Arkansas]] are noted as a source for these. Novaculite is also found in Syria and Lebanon, previously a part of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] (Turkish) empire, hence the use of the older name in America of ''Turkey stone''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.popularwoodworking.com/article/what-is-an-oilstone-2 |title=What is an Oilstone? |last=Adam Cherubini |date=12 October 2011 |publisher=Popular Woodworking magazine |accessdate=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the block is intended for installation on a bench it is called a bench stone. Small, portable stones (commonly made of bonded abrasive) are called pocket stones. Being smaller, they are more portable than bench stones but present difficulty in maintaining a consistent angle and pressure when drawing the stone along larger blades. However, they still can form a good edge. Frequently, fine grained pocket stones are used for honing, especially "in the field". Despite being a [[homophone]] with ''wet'' in most dialects of modern English, whetstones do not need to be lubricated with oil or water, although it is very common to do so. Lubrication aids the cutting action and carries [[swarf]] away.

==Japanese waterstones==
[[File:Waterstones.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Two Japanese waterstones]]
The Japanese traditionally used natural sharpening stones lubricated with water (using oil on a waterstone reduces its effectiveness.) They have been doing this for many hundreds of years. The geology of Japan provided a type of stone which consists of fine silicate particles in a clay matrix, somewhat softer than [[novaculite]].&lt;ref&gt;David A.Warren, ''Getting and Edge the Japanese Way'', ''Popular Mechanics'', January 1984, pp. 104-107&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese stones are also sedimentary. The most famous are typically mined in the [[Narutaki District]] just north of [[Kyoto]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Grades of waterstones===
Historically, there are three broad grades of Japanese sharpening stones: the ''ara-to'', or "rough stone", the ''naka-to'' or "middle/medium stone" and the ''shiage-to'' or "finishing stone". There is a fourth type of stone, the ''nagura'', which is not used directly. Rather, it is used to form a cutting slurry on the ''shiage-to'', which is often too hard to create the necessary slurry. Converting these names to absolute grit size is difficult as the classes are broad and natural stones have no inherent "grit number". As an indication, ''ara-to'' is probably (using a non-Japanese system of grading grit size) 500–1000 grit. The ''naka-to'' is probably 3000–5000 grit and the ''shiage-to'' is likely 7000–10000 grit. Current synthetic grit values range from extremely coarse, such as 120 grit, through extremely fine, such as 30,000 grit (less than half a [[micrometre|micrometer]] abrasive particle size).{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Diamond plate==
[[File:Diamondstone.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A diamond plate]]

A diamond plate is a steel plate, sometimes mounted on a plastic or resin base, coated with [[diamond]] [[Mesh (scale)|grit]], an abrasive that will grind metal. When they are mounted they are sometimes known as diamond stones.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Klenck, ''Tool Test: DMT Diamond Sharpeners'', ''Popular Mechanics'', March 1991 pp.62-63&lt;/ref&gt; The plate may have a series of holes cut in it that capture the [[swarf]] cast off as grinding takes place, and cuts costs by reducing the amount of abrasive surface area on each plate. Diamond plates can serve many purposes including sharpening steel tools, and for maintaining the flatness of man-made waterstones, which can become grooved or hollowed in use. Truing (flattening a stone whose shape has been changed as it wears away) is widely considered essential to the sharpening process but some hand sharpening techniques utilise the high points of a non-true stone. As the only part of a diamond plate to wear away is a very thin coating of grit and adhesive, and in a good diamond plate this wear is minimal due to diamond's hardness, a diamond plate retains its flatness. Rubbing the diamond plate on a whetstone to true (flatten) the whetstone is a modern alternative to more traditional truing methods.&lt;ref name="Miller12"&gt;Miller, Jeff (2012). ''The Foundations of Better Woodworking: How to use your body, tools and materials to do your best work'', Popular Woodworking Books, 2012 {{ISBN|1440321019}}, page 120&lt;/ref&gt;

Diamond plates are available in various plate sizes (from credit card to bench plate size) and grades of grit. A coarser grit is used to remove larger amounts of metal more rapidly, such as when forming an edge or restoring a damaged edge. A finer grit is used to remove the scratches of larger grits and to refine an edge. There are two-sided plates with each side coated with a different grit.&lt;ref name=Trend/&gt;

The highest quality diamond sharpeners use monocrystalline diamonds, single structures which will not break, giving them an excellent lifespan. These diamonds are bonded onto a precision ground surface, set in nickel, and electroplated. This process locks the diamonds in place.&lt;ref name=Trend&gt;[http://www.wonkeedonkeetrend.co.uk/diamond-sharpening/diamond-sharpening-stones/ wonkeedonkeetrend.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:DMT Black 220 Label.jpg|thumb|Hobby microscope view of a 220 grit diamond sharpening stone. Tiny diamonds are electroplated to a perforated metal carrier strip and bonded to a plastic backing. The feature identified with the red line across it measures about 0.08 mm across. The dark area at upper right is a void designed to allow for swarf created during sharpening to be cleared from the diamonds. This relatively coarse stone would be used to reshape a damaged blade edge which would be refined by finer grit stones.]]

'''Silver telluride''' (Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te) is a chemical compound, a [[telluride (chemistry)|telluride]] of [[silver]], also known as disilver telluride or silver(I) telluride. It forms a [[monoclinic]] crystal. In a wider sense, ''silver telluride'' can be used to denote AgTe (silver(II) telluride, a [[metastability in molecules|metastable]] compound) or Ag&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

Silver(I) telluride occurs naturally as the mineral [[hessite]], whereas silver(II) telluride  is known as [[empressite]].

Silver telluride is a [[semiconductor]] which can be doped both n-type and p-type. Stoichiometric Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te has n-type conductivity. On heating silver is lost from the material.

[[Non-stoichiometric]] silver telluride has shown [[Extraordinary Magnetoresistance|extraordinary magnetoresistance]].

This dam, the tallest and slenderest at that time, failed because of an excessive horizontal slip in the gneissic abutment. The tolerable displacement considered in design is not known but, if calculated today, the size effect would reduce it to about one half of the value according to the design procedures in the 1950s.]]
According to the classical theories of [[elasticity (physics)|elastic]] or [[plasticity (physics)|plastic]] [[structure]]s made from a material with non-[[random]] [[strength of materials|strength]] (''f''&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;), the nominal strength (''σ''&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;) of a structure is independent of the structure size (''D'') when geometrically similar structures are considered.&lt;ref&gt;The nominal strength of a structure (''σ''&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;) has units of [[stress (mechanics)|stress]] and is related to the maximum load (''P''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) that the structure can support.  For structures that can be approximated as two-dimensional, ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; = ''P''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;/''bD'' where ''b'' is the thickness of the two-dimensional structure.  For three-dimensional structures, ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; = ''P''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;/''D''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Any structure dimension can be chosen for ''D'' but it must be [[wikt:homologous|homologous]] for every size.&lt;/ref&gt; Any deviation from this property is called the '''size effect'''.  For example, conventional [[strength of materials]] predicts that a large [[beam bending|beam]] and a tiny beam will fail at the same [[stress (physics)|stress]] if they are made of the same material.  In the real world, because of size effects, a larger beam will fail at a lower stress than a smaller beam.

The structural size effect concerns structures made of the same material, with the same [[microstructure]]. It must be distinguished from the size effect of material inhomogeneities, particularly the [[Grain boundary strengthening|Hall-Petch effect]], which describes how the material strength increases with decreasing [[grain size]] in [[polycrystalline]] [[metal]]s.

The size effect can have two causes: 
# statistical, due to material strength randomness, and 
# energetic (and non-statistical), due to energy release when a large crack or a large [[fracture mechanics|fracture process zone]] (FPZ) containing [[damage mechanics|damage]]d material develops before the maximum load is reached.

The limitations of elasticity theory are discussed in good textbooks on the topic. The same holds for plasticity theory. Modern computational models do not have these limitations and they predict structural strength correctly for any size. The scientists that develop new material models make sure that the results agree with the size effect laws. The engineers that design exceptionally large structures make sure that the calculations do not include a size effect mistake.

==Statistical Theory of Size Effect in Brittle Structures==

[[Image:FigY3.png|thumb|upright=2|Fig. 1]]

The statistical size effect occurs for a broad class of brittle structures that follow the weakest-link model. This model means that macro-fracture initiation from one material element, or more precisely one [[representative volume element]] (RVE), causes the whole structure to fail, like the failure of one link in a chain (Fig. 1a). Since the material strength is random, the strength of the weakest material element in the structure (Fig. 1a) is likely to decrease with increasing structure size &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; (as noted already by Mariotte in 1684).

Denoting the failure probabilities of structure as &lt;math&gt;P_f&lt;/math&gt;  and of one RVE under stress &lt;math&gt;\sigma_k &lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;P_1(\sigma_k)&lt;/math&gt;, and noting that the survival probability of a chain is the joint probability of survival of all its &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; links, one readily concludes that
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
1 - P_f = \prod_{k=1}^N [1 - P_1(\sigma_k)]
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

The key is the left tail of the distribution of &lt;math&gt;P_1(\sigma_k)&lt;/math&gt;. It was not successfully identified until Weibull in 1939 recognized that the tail is a power law. Denoting the tail exponent as &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, one can then show that, if the structure is sufficiently larger than one RVE (i.e., if {{math|''N/l&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' ''→'' ''∞''}}), the failure probability of a structure as a function of &lt;math&gt;\sigma_N&lt;/math&gt; is

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
 P_f \; = \; 1\, -\, e^{- (\sigma_N /S_0)^m}\ \text{where}\ S_0 = s_0 (l_0 / D)^{n_d/m} \Psi^{-1/m}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

Eq. 2 is the cumulative Weibull distribution with scale parameter &lt;math&gt;S_0&lt;/math&gt; and shape parameter &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;\Psi = \int_V \left[{\hat\sigma}(\xi) \right]^m \, \mbox{d} V(\xi)&lt;/math&gt; = constant factor depending on the structure geometry, &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; = structure volume; &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; = relative (size-independent) coordinate vectors, &lt;math&gt;\hat\sigma (\xi)&lt;/math&gt; = dimensionless stress field (dependent on geometry), scaled so that the maximum stress be 1; &lt;math&gt;n_d&lt;/math&gt; = number of spatial dimensions (&lt;math&gt;n_d&lt;/math&gt; = 1, 2 or 3); &lt;math&gt;l_0&lt;/math&gt; = material characteristic length representing the effective size of the RVE (typically about 3 inhomogeneity sizes).

The RVE is here defined as the smallest material volume whose failure suffices to make the whole
structure fail. From experience, the structure is sufficiently larger than one RVE if the equivalent number &lt;math&gt;N_{eq}&lt;/math&gt; of RVEs in the structure is larger than about &lt;math&gt;10^4&lt;/math&gt; ; &lt;math&gt;N_{eq} =( D / l_0 )^{n_d}\Psi&lt;/math&gt; = number of RVEs giving the same &lt;math&gt;P_f&lt;/math&gt; if the stress field is homogeneous (always &lt;math&gt;N_{eq} &lt; N&lt;/math&gt;, and usually &lt;math&gt;N_{eq} \ll N&lt;/math&gt;). For most normal-scale applications to metals and fine-grained ceramics, except for micrometer scale devices, the size is large enough for the Weibull theory to apply (but not for coarse-grained materials such as concrete).

From Eq. 2 one can show that the mean strength and the coefficient of variation of strength are obtained as follows:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
 \bar{\sigma}_N \; = \; C_s (l_0 / D)^{n/m}, \; C_s \; = \; [\Gamma(1+m^{-1})\Psi^{-1/m}s_0
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
 w \; = \; [\Gamma(1+2m^{-1})\Gamma^{-2}(1+m^{-1})-1]^{1/2}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4}}}}

(where &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the gamma function) The first equation shows that the size effect on the mean nominal strength is
a power function of size &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;, regardless of structure geometry.

Weibull parameter &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; can be experimentally identified by two methods: 1) The values of &lt;math&gt;\sigma_N&lt;/math&gt; measured on many identical specimens are used to calculate the coefficient of variation of strength, and the value of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; then follows by solving Eq. (4); or 2) the values of &lt;math&gt;\bar{\sigma}_N&lt;/math&gt; are measured on geometrically similar specimens of several different sizes &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; and the slope of their linear regression in the plot of &lt;math&gt;\log \bar{\sigma}_N&lt;/math&gt; versus &lt;math&gt;\log D&lt;/math&gt; gives &lt;math&gt;-1/m&lt;/math&gt;. Method 1 must give the same result for different sizes, and method 2 the same as method 1. If not, the size effect is partly or totally non-Weibullian. Omission of testing for different sizes has often led to incorrect conclusions. Another check is that the histogram of the strengths of many identical specimens must be a straight line when plotted in the Weibull scale. A deviation to the right at high strength range means that &lt;math&gt;N_{eq}&lt;/math&gt; is too small and the material quasibrittle.

==Energetic Size Effect==

The fact that the Weibull size effect is a power law means that it is self-similar, i.e., no characteristic structure size &lt;math&gt;D_0&lt;/math&gt; exists, and &lt;math&gt;l_0&lt;/math&gt; and material inhomogeneities are negligible compared to &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;. This is the case for fatigue-embrittled metals or fine-grained ceramics except on the micrometer scale. The existence of a finite &lt;math&gt;D_0&lt;/math&gt; is a salient feature of the energetic size effect, discovered in 1984. This kind of size effect represents a transition between two power laws and is observed in brittle heterogenous materials, termed quasibrittle. These materials include concrete, fiber composites, rocks, coarse-grained and toughened ceramics, rigid foams, sea ice, dental ceramics, dentine, bone, biological shells, many bio- and bio-inspired materials, masonry, mortar, stiff cohesive soils, grouted soils, consolidated snow, wood, paper, carton, coal, cemented sands, etc. On the micro- or nano scale, all the brittle materials become quasibrittle, and thus must exhibit the energetic size effect.

A pronounced energetic size effect occurs in shear, torsional and punching failures of reinforced concrete, in pullout of anchors from concrete, in compression failure of slender [[reinforced concrete column]]s and prestressed concrete beams, in compression and tensile failures of fiber-polymer composites and sandwich structures, and in the failures of all the aforementioned quasibrittle materials. One may distinguish two basic types of this size effect.

===Type 1: Structures that fail at crack initiation===

[[Image:FigY5.png|thumb|upright=2|Fig. 2]]

When the macro-crack initiates from one RVE whose size is not negligible compared to the structure size, the deterministic size effect dominates over the statistical size effect. What causes the size effect is a stress redistribution in the structure (Fig. 2c) due to damage in the initiating RVE, which is typically located at fracture surface.

A simple intuitive justification of this size effect may be given by considering the ﬂexural failure of an unnotched simply supported beam under a concentrated load &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; at midspan (Fig. 2d). Due to material heterogeneity, what decides the maximum load &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is not the elastically calculated stress &lt;math&gt;\sigma_1 = M c/I = 3 P L / 2 b D^2&lt;/math&gt; at the tensile face, where &lt;math&gt;M = PL/4&lt;/math&gt; = bending moment, &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; = beam depth, &lt;math&gt;c=D/2,\;I = bh^3/12&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; = beam width. Rather, what decides is the stress value &lt;math&gt;\bar{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt; roughly at distance &lt;math&gt;l_0/2&lt;/math&gt; from the tensile face, which is at the middle of FPZ (2c). Noting that &lt;math&gt;\bar{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\sigma_1 - \sigma'_n l_0/2&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\sigma'_n&lt;/math&gt; = stress gradient = &lt;math&gt;2 \sigma_1 / D&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\bar{\sigma} = f'_t&lt;/math&gt; = intrinsic tensile strength of the material, and considering the failure condition &lt;math&gt;\bar{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;f'_t&lt;/math&gt;, one gets &lt;math&gt;P/bD = \sigma_N&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\sigma_0 / (1 -
D_b/D)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\sigma_0 = (2D/3L)f'_t&lt;/math&gt;, which is a constant because for geometrically similar beams &lt;math&gt;L/D&lt;/math&gt; = constant. This expression is valid only for small enough &lt;math&gt;l_0/D&lt;/math&gt;, and so (according to the first two terms of the binomial expansion) one may approximate it as

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\sigma_N = \sigma_0 \left( 1 + \frac{r l_0} D \right)^{1/r}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|5}}}}

which is the law of Type 1 deterministic size effect (Fig. 2a). The purpose of the approximation made is: (a) to prevent &lt;math&gt;\sigma_N&lt;/math&gt; from becoming negative for very small &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;, for which the foregoing argument does not apply; and (b) to satisfy the asymptotic condition that the deterministic size effect must vanish for &lt;math&gt;D/l_0 \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;. Here &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; = positive empirical constant; the values &lt;math&gt;r = 1&lt;/math&gt; = or 2 have been used for concrete, while &lt;math&gt;r \approx 1.45&lt;/math&gt; is optimum according to the existing test data from the literature (Fig. 2d).

A fundamental derivation of Eq. 5 for a general structural geometry has been given by
applying dimensional analysis and asymptotic matching to the limit case of energy release when the initial macro-crack length tends to zero. For general structures, the following effective size may be substituted in Eq. (5):

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
D = 2 \sigma_0 / E \epsilon'_n
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|6}}}}

where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon'_n&lt;/math&gt; = strain gradient at the maximum strain point located at the surface, in the direction
normal to the surface.

Eq. 5 cannot apply for large sizes because it approaches for &lt;math&gt;D \to \infty&lt;/math&gt; a horizontal asymptote.
For large sizes, &lt;math&gt;\sigma_N&lt;/math&gt; must approach the Weibull statistical size effect, Eq. 3. This condition is satisfied by the generalized energetic-statistical size effect law:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\bar \sigma_N = \sigma_0 \left[ \left( \frac{l_0} D \right)^{r n_d/m}
               +\ \frac{r l_0}D\ \right]^{1/r}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|7}}}}

where &lt;math&gt;r, m&lt;/math&gt; are empirical constants (&lt;math&gt;r n_d/m &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;). The deterministic formula (5) is recovered as the limit case for &lt;math&gt;m \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt;. (Fig. 2d) shows a comparison of the last formula with the test results for many different concretes, plotted as dimensionless strength &lt;math&gt;\sigma_N /f'_t&lt;/math&gt; versus dimensionless structure size &lt;math&gt;D/D_0&lt;/math&gt;.

The probabilistic theory of Type 1 size effect can be derived from fracture nano-mechanics. Kramer’s
transition rate theory shows that, on the nano-scale, the far-left tail of the probability distribution of nano-scale strength &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is a power law of the type &lt;math&gt;s^2&lt;/math&gt;. Analysis of the multiscale transition to the material macro-scale then shows that the RVE strength distribution is Gaussian but with a Weibull (or power-law) left tail whose exponent &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is much larger than 2 and is grafted roughly at the probability of about 0.001.

For structures with &lt;math&gt;N_{eq} &lt; 10^4&lt;/math&gt;, which are common for quasibrittle materials, the Weibull theory does not apply. But the underlying weakest-link model, expressed by Eq. (1) for &lt;math&gt;P_f&lt;/math&gt;, does, albeit with a finite &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, which is a crucial point. The finiteness of the weakest-link chain model causes major deviations from the Weibull distribution. As the structure size, measured by &lt;math&gt;N_{eq}&lt;/math&gt;, increases, the grafting point of the Weibullian left part moves to the right until, at about &lt;math&gt;N_{eq} = 10^4&lt;/math&gt;, the entire distribution becomes Weibullian. The mean strength can be computed from this distribution and, as it turns out, its plot is identical with the plot of Eq. 5 seen in Fig. 2g. The point of deviation from the Weibull asymptote is determined by the location of the grafting point on the strength distribution of one RVE (Fig. 2g). Note that the finiteness of the chain in the weakest-link model captures the deterministic part of size effect.

This theory has also been extended to the size effect on the Evans and [[Paris' law]]s of crack growth in quasibrittle materials, and to the size effect on the static and fatigue lifetimes. It appeared that the size effect on the lifetime is much stronger than it is on the short-time strength (tail exponent &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is an order-of-magnitude smaller).

===Type 2: Structures in which a large crack or notch exists===

[[Image:FigY4.png|thumb|upright=2|Fig. 4]]

The strongest possible size effect occurs for specimens with similar deep notches (Fig. 4b), or for structures in which a large crack, similar for different sizes, forms stably before the maximum load is reached. Because the location of fracture initiation is predetermined to occur at the crack tip and thus cannot sample the random strengths of different RVEs, the statistical contribution to the mean size effect is negligible. Such behavior is typical of reinforced concrete, damaged fiber-reinforced polymers and some compressed unreinforced structures.

The energetic size effect may be intuitively explained by considering the panel in Fig. 1c,d,
initially under a uniform stress equal to &lt;math&gt;\sigma_N&lt;/math&gt; . Introduction of a crack of length &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, with a damage zone
of width &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; at the tip, relieves the stress, and thus also the strain energy, from the shaded undamaged triangles of slope &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; on the ﬂanks of the crack. Then, if &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a/D&lt;/math&gt; are approximately the same for different sizes, the energy released from the shaded triangles is proportional to &lt;math&gt;\bar U D^2&lt;/math&gt;, while the energy dissipated by the fracture process is proportional to &lt;math&gt;G_f D&lt;/math&gt;; here &lt;math&gt;G_f&lt;/math&gt; = fracture energy of the material, &lt;math&gt;\bar U = \sigma_N^2/2E&lt;/math&gt; = energy density before fracture,  and &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; = Young’s elastic modulus. The discrepancy between &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D^2&lt;/math&gt; shows that a balance of energy release and dissipation rate can exist for every size &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; only if &lt;math&gt;\sigma_N&lt;/math&gt; decreases with increasing &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;. If the energy dissipated within the damage zone of width &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is added, one obtains the Bažant (1984) size effect law (Type 2):

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\sigma_N = B f'_t \left(1 + \frac D {D_0} \right)^{-1/2}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|8}}}}

(Fig. 4c,d) where &lt;math&gt;B, f'_t, D_0&lt;/math&gt; = constants, where &lt;math&gt;f'_t&lt;/math&gt; = tensile strength of material, and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; accounts for the structure geometry.

For more complex geometries such an intuitive derivation is not possible. However, dimensional
analysis coupled with asymptotic matching showed that Eq. 8 is applicable in general, and that the dependence of its parameters on the structure geometry has approximately the following form:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
B f'_t = \sqrt{\frac{E G_f}{g'(\alpha_0) c_f} }, \;\;\;\;
D_0 = c_f \frac{g'(\alpha_0)}{g(\alpha_0)}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|9}}}}

where &lt;math&gt;c_f \approx&lt;/math&gt; half of the FPZ length, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_0 = a/D&lt;/math&gt; = relative initial crack length (which is constant for geometrically similar scaling); &lt;math&gt;g(\alpha_0) = k^2(\alpha_0)&lt;/math&gt; = dimensionless energy release function of linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM), which brings about the effect of structure geometry; &lt;math&gt;k(\alpha_0)= K(\alpha_0) b \sqrt D /P&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; = stress intensity factor. Fitting Eq. 8 to &lt;math&gt;\sigma_N&lt;/math&gt; data from tests of geometrically similar notched specimens of very different sizes is a good way to identify the &lt;math&gt;G_f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_f&lt;/math&gt; of the material.

==Size Effect in Cohesive Crack, Crack Band and Nonlocal Models==

Numerical simulations of failure by finite element codes can capture the energetic (or deterministic) size effect only if the material law relating the stress to deformation possesses a characteristic length. This was not the case for the classical finite element codes with a material characterized solely by stress-strain relations.

One simple enough computational method is the cohesive (or fictitious) crack model, in which it is assumed that the stress &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; transmitted across a partially opened crack is a decreasing function of the crack opening &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\sigma = f(w)&lt;/math&gt;. The area under this function is &lt;math&gt;G_f&lt;/math&gt;, and

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
l_{ch} = E G_f /{f'_t}^2
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|10}}}}

is the material characteristic length giving rise to the deterministic size effect. An even simpler method is the crack-band model, in which the cohesive crack is replaced in simulations by a crack band of width &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; equal to one finite element size and a stress-strain relation that is softening in the cross-band direction as &lt;math&gt;\sigma = \hat f (\epsilon)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon = w/h&lt;/math&gt; = average strain in that direction.

When &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; needs to be adjusted, the softening stress strain relation is adjusted so as to maintain the correct energy dissipation &lt;math&gt;G_f&lt;/math&gt;. A more versatile method is the nonlocal damage model in which the stress at a continuum point is a function not of the strain at that point but of the average of the strain field within a certain neighborhood of size &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; centered at that point. Still another method is the gradient damage model in which the stress depends not only on the strain at that point but also on the gradient of strain. All these computational methods can ensure objectivity and proper convergence with respect to the refinement of the finite element mesh.

==Fractal Aspects of Size Effect==

The fractal properties of material, including the fractal aspect of crack surface roughness and the lacunar fractal aspect of pore structure, may have a role in the size effect in concrete, and may affect the fracture energy of material. However, the fractal properties have yet not been experimentally documented for a broad enough scale and the problem has not yet been studied in depth comparable to the statistical and energetic size effects. The main obstacle to the practical consideration of a fractal inﬂuence on the size effect is that, if calibrated for one structure geometry, it is not clear how infer the size effect for another geometry. The pros and cons were discussed, e.g., by Carpinteri et al. (1994, 2001) and Bažant and Yavari (2005).

==Practical Importance==
[[Image:SizeEffectFig06.png|thumb|upright=2|Fig. 5 Schematic explanation of failure of Sleipner A Oil Platform, Norway 1991. The tricell of this $500 million, 190m meters tall, structure imploded under water head of 67 m, causing the platform so sink within 18 minutes (no fatalities). A government commission identified two factors causing failure: poor detailing of reinforcement, and poor finite element mesh. A separate investigation documented a third contributing factor: the size effect in the shear failure shown, which reduced the shear capacity by about 40%.]]

Taking the size effect into account is essential for safe prediction of strength of large concrete bridges, nuclear containments, roof shells, tall buildings, tunnel linings, large load-bearing parts of aircraft, spacecraft and ships made of fiber-polymer composites, wind turbines, large geotechnical excavations, earth and rock slopes, ﬂoating sea ice carrying loads, oil platforms under ice forces, etc. Their design depends on the material properties measured on much smaller laboratory specimens. These properties must be extrapolated to sizes greater by one or two orders of magnitude. Even if an expensive full-scale failure test, for example a failure test of the rudder of a very large aircraft, can be carried out, it is financially prohibitive to repeat it thousand times to obtain the statistical distribution of load capacity. Such statistical information, underlying the safety factors, is obtainable only by proper extrapolation of laboratory tests.

The size effect is gaining in importance as larger and larger structures, of more and more slender forms, are being built. The safety factors, of course, give large safety margins—so large that even for the largest civil engineering structures the classical deterministic analysis based on the mean material properties normally yields failure loads smaller than the maximum design loads. For this reasons, the size effect on the strength in brittle failures of concrete structures and structural laminates has long been ignored. Then, however, the failure probability, which is required to be &lt;math&gt;&lt;10^{-6}&lt;/math&gt;, and actually does have such values for normal-size structures, may become for very large structures as low as &lt;math&gt;10^{-3}&lt;/math&gt; per lifetime. Such high failure probability is intolerable as it adds significantly to the risks to which people are inevitably exposed. In fact, the historical experience shows that very large structures have been failing at a frequency several orders of magnitude higher than smaller ones. The reason it has not led to public outcry is that the large structures are few. But for the locals, who must use the structures daily, the risk is not acceptable.

Another application is the testing of the fracture energy and characteristic material length. For quasibrittle materials, measuring the size effect on the peak loads (and on the specimen softening after the peak load) is the simplest approach.

Knowing the size effect is also important in the reverse sense—for micrometer scale devices if they
are designed partly of fully on the basis of material properties measured more conveniently on the scale of 0.01m to 0.1m.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9533">A '''solar simulator''' (also '''[[Artificial sunlight|artificial sun]]''') is a device that provides illumination approximating natural [[sunlight]]. The purpose of the solar simulator is to provide a controllable indoor test facility under laboratory conditions, used for the testing of [[solar cells]], [[sun screen]], [[plastics]], and other materials and devices.

==Classification==
The IEC 60904-9 Edition2 and ASTM E927-10 standards
&lt;ref name=ASTM_SolarSim&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Specification for Solar Simulation for Photovoltaic Testing | doi = 10.1520/E0927-10 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
are a common specification for solar simulators used for [[photovoltaic]] testing. The light from a solar simulator is controlled in three dimensions:
# spectral content
# spatial uniformity
# temporal stability
Each dimension is classified in one of three classes: A, B, or C. The specifications required for each class are defined in Table 1 below. A solar simulator meeting class A specifications in all three dimensions is referred to as a Class A solar simulator, or sometimes a Class AAA (referring to each of the dimensions in the order listed above).&lt;ref name=ASTM_SolarSim /&gt;

The solar simulation spectrum is further specified via the integrated irradiance across several wavelength intervals. The percentage of total irradiance is shown below in Table 2 for the standard terrestrial spectra of [[Air mass coefficient|AM]]1.5G and [[Air mass coefficient|AM]]1.5D, and the extraterrestrial spectrum, [[Air mass coefficient|AM]]0.

These specifications were primarily intended for [[silicon]] [[photovoltaics]], and hence the spectral range over which the intervals were defined was limited mainly to the absorption region of silicon. While this definition is also adequate for several other [[photovoltaic]] technologies, including [[thin film solar cells]] constructed from [[cadmium telluride|CdTe]] or [[copper indium gallium selenide|CIGS]], it is not sufficient for the emerging sub-field of [[concentrated photovoltaics]] using high-efficiency III-V [[semiconductor]] [[multijunction solar cell|multi-junction solar cells]] due to their wider absorption bandwidth of 300–1800&amp;nbsp;nm.

==Types of solar simulators==
Solar simulators can be divided into three broad categories: continuous, flashed, and pulsed. The first type is a familiar form of light source in which illumination is continuous in time. The specifications discussed in the previous section most directly relate to this type of solar simulator. This category is most often used for low intensity testing, from less than 1 sun up to several suns. In this context, 1 sun is typically defined as the nominal full sunlight intensity on a bright clear day on Earth, which measures 1000 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Continuous light solar simulators may have several different lamp types combined (e.g. an arc source and one or more halogen lamps) to extend the spectrum far into the infrared.

[[File:1 Lamp solar simulator.jpg|thumb|working principle of a 1 Lamp Solar Simulator, typically are used a Xenon short arc lamp]]

The second type of solar simulator is the flashed simulator which is qualitatively similar to [[flash photography]] and use [[flashtube|flash tubes]]. With typical durations of several milliseconds, very high intensities of up to several thousand suns are possible. This type of equipment is often used to prevent unnecessary heat build-up in the device under test. However, due to the rapid heating and cooling of the lamp, the intensity and light spectrum are inherently transient, making repeated reliable testing more technically challenging. The temporal stability dimension of the standard does not directly apply to this category of solar simulators, although it can be replaced by an analogous shot-to-shot repeatability specification.

The third type of solar simulator is the pulsed simulator, which uses a shutter to quickly block or unblock the light from a continuous source.  This category is a compromise between the continuous and flash, having the disadvantage of the high power usage and relatively low intensities of the continuous simulators, but advantage of stable output intensity and spectrum. The short illumination duration also provides the benefit of the low thermal loads of flashed simulators. Pulses are typically on the order of 100 milliseconds up to 800 milliseconds for special Xe Long Pulse Systems.

==Types of lamps==
Several types of lamps have been used as the light sources within solar simulators.

[[File:WACOM-Xe-Lamp.jpg|thumb|Spectrum information from a Class AAA  1 Lamp Solar Simulator by using a Xenon Lamp.]]

[[Xenon arc lamp]]: this is the most common type of lamp both for continuous and flashed solar simulators. These lamps offer high intensities and an unfiltered [[spectrum]] which matches reasonably well to sunlight. However, the Xe spectrum is also characterized by many undesirable sharp atomic transitional peaks, making the spectrum less desirable for some spectrally sensitive applications.

[[Metal halide lamp|Metal Halide arc lamp]]: Primarily developed for use in film and television lighting where a high temporal stability and daylight colour match are required, metal halide arc lamps are also used in solar simulation.

QTH: quartz tungsten [[halogen lamps]] offer spectra which very closely match [[Black-body radiation|black body radiation]], although typically with a lower [[color temperature]] than the sun.

LED: [[light-emitting diodes]] have recently been used in research laboratories to construct solar simulators, and may offer promise in the future for energy-efficient production of spectrally tailored artificial sunlight.

{{Sound measurements}}

The '''speed of sound''' is the distance travelled per unit time by a [[sound wave]] as it propagates through an [[elasticity (solid mechanics)|elastic]] medium. At {{convert|20|C|F}}, the speed of sound in air is about 343 meters per second (1,234.8 km/h; 1,125 ft/s; 767 mph; 667 kn), or a kilometre in {{nobreak|2.9 s}} or a mile in {{nobreak|4.7 s}}. It depends strongly on temperature, but also varies by several meters per second due to which gases are present.

The speed of sound in an [[ideal gas]] depends only on its temperature and composition. The speed has a weak dependence on frequency and pressure in ordinary air, deviating slightly from ideal behavior.

In common everyday speech, ''speed of sound'' refers to the speed of sound waves in [[Earth's atmosphere|air]]. However, the speed of sound varies from substance to substance: sound travels most slowly in [[gas]]es; it travels faster in [[liquid]]s; and faster still in [[solids]]. For example, (as noted above), sound travels at {{nobreak|343 m/s}} in air; it travels at {{nobreak|1,480 m/s}} in [[water]] (4.3 times as fast as in air); and at {{nobreak|5,120 m/s}} in iron (about 15 times as fast as in air). In an exceptionally stiff material such as diamond, sound travels at 12,000 metres per second (27,000 mph);&lt;ref&gt;[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/tables/soundv.html Speed of Sound]&lt;/ref&gt; (about 35 times as fast as in air) which is around the maximum speed that sound will travel under normal conditions.

Sound waves in solids are composed of compression waves (just as in gases and liquids), and a different type of sound wave called a [[S-wave|shear wave]], which occurs only in solids. Shear waves in solids usually travel at different speeds, as exhibited in [[seismology]]. The speed of compression waves in solids is determined by the medium's [[compressibility]], [[shear modulus]] and density. The speed of shear waves is determined only by the solid material's shear modulus and density.

In [[fluid dynamics]], the speed of sound in a fluid medium (gas or liquid) is used as a relative measure for the speed of an object moving through the medium. The ratio of the speed of an object to the speed of sound in the fluid is called the object's [[Mach number]]. Objects moving at speeds greater than ''{{gaps|Mach|1}}'' are said to be traveling at [[supersonic]] speeds.

==History==
[[Sir Isaac Newton]] computed the speed of sound in air as {{convert|979|ft/s|m/s|0}}, which is too low by about 15%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Newton's analysis was good save for neglecting the (then unknown) effect of rapidly-fluctuating temperature in a sound wave (in modern terms, sound wave compression and expansion of air is an [[adiabatic process]], not an [[isothermal process]]). This error was later rectified by [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Laplace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

During the 17th century, there were several attempts to measure the speed of sound accurately, including attempts by [[Marin Mersenne]] in 1630 (1,380 Parisian feet per second), [[Pierre Gassendi]] in 1635 (1,473 Parisian feet per second) and [[Robert Boyle]] (1,125 Parisian feet per second).&lt;ref name=meridian/&gt;

In 1709, the Reverend [[William Derham]], [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|Rector]] of Upminster, published a more accurate measure of the speed of sound, at 1,072 [[Paris inch|Parisian feet]] per second.&lt;ref name=meridian&gt;{{cite book

Measurements were made of gunshots from a number of local landmarks, including [[North Ockendon]] church. The distance was known by [[triangulation]], and thus the speed that the sound had travelled was calculated.&lt;ref name="Tony Fox"&gt;{{cite book

== Basic concepts ==
The transmission of sound can be illustrated by using a model consisting of an array of spherical objects interconnected by springs.

In real material terms, the spheres represent the material's molecules and the springs represent the [[Chemical bond|bonds]] between them. Sound passes through the system by compressing and expanding the springs, transmitting the acoustic energy to neighboring spheres. This helps transmit the energy in-turn to the neighboring sphere's springs (bonds), and so on. 

The speed of sound through the model depends on the [[stiffness]]/rigidity of the [[Spring (device)|spring]]s, and the mass of the spheres. As long as the spacing of the spheres remains constant, stiffer springs/bonds transmit energy quicker, while larger spheres transmit the energy slower.  

In a real material, the stiffness of the springs is known as the "[[elastic modulus]]", and the mass corresponds to the material [[density]]. Given that all other things being equal ([[ceteris paribus]]), sound will travel slower in [[Sponge (material)|spongy material]]s, and faster in stiffer ones. Effects like dispersion and reflection can also be understood using this model. {{citation needed|date=August 2017}}  

For instance, sound will travel 1.59 times faster in nickel than in bronze, due to the greater stiffness of nickel at about the same density. Similarly, sound travels about 1.41 times faster in light hydrogen ([[Hydrogen-1|protium]]) gas than in heavy hydrogen ([[deuterium]]) gas, since deuterium has similar properties but twice the density. At the same time, "compression-type" sound will travel faster in solids than in liquids, and faster in liquids than in gases, because the solids are more difficult to compress than liquids, while liquids in turn are more difficult to compress than gases.

Some textbooks mistakenly state that the speed of sound increases with density. This notion is illustrated by presenting data for three materials, such as air, water and steel, which also have vastly different compressibility, more  which making up for the density differences. An illustrative example of the two effects is that sound travels only 4.3 times faster in water than air, despite enormous differences in compressibility of the two media. The reason is that the larger density of water, which works to ''slow'' sound in water relative to air, nearly makes up for the compressibility differences in the two media.

A practical example can be observed in Edinburgh when the "One o' Clock Gun" is fired at the eastern end of Edinburgh Castle. Standing at the base of the western end of the Castle Rock, the sound of the Gun can be heard through the rock, slightly before it arrives by the air route, partly delayed by the slightly longer route. It is particularly effective if a multi-gun salute such as for "The Queen's Birthday" is being fired.

===Compression and shear waves===
[[File:Onde compression impulsion 1d 30 petit.gif|thumb|Pressure-pulse or compression-type wave ([[longitudinal wave]]) confined to a plane. This is the only type of sound wave that travels in fluids (gases and liquids). A pressure-type wave may also travel in solids, along with other types of waves ([[transverse wave]]s, see below)]]
[[File:Onde cisaillement impulsion 1d 30 petit.gif|thumb|[[Transverse wave]] affecting atoms initially confined to a plane. This additional type of sound wave (additional type of elastic wave) travels only in solids, for it requires a sideways shearing motion which is supported by the presence of elasticity in the solid. The sideways shearing motion may take place in '''any''' direction which is at right-angle to the direction of wave-travel (only one shear direction is shown here, at right angles to the plane). Furthermore, the right-angle shear direction may change over time and distance, resulting in different types of ''[[Polarization (waves)|polarization]]'' of shear-waves]]

In a gas or liquid, sound consists of compression waves. In solids, waves propagate as two different types. A [[longitudinal wave]] is associated with compression and decompression in the direction of travel, and is the same process in gases and liquids, with an analogous compression-type wave in solids. Only compression waves are supported in gases and liquids. An additional type of wave, the [[transverse wave]], also called a [[shear wave]], occurs only in solids because only solids support elastic deformations. It is due to elastic deformation of the medium perpendicular to the direction of wave travel; the direction of shear-deformation is called the "[[Polarization (waves)|polarization]]" of this type of wave. In general, transverse waves occur as a pair of [[orthogonal]] polarizations.

These different waves (compression waves and the different polarizations of shear waves) may have different speeds at the same frequency. Therefore, they arrive at an observer at different times, an extreme example being an [[earthquake]], where sharp compression waves arrive first and rocking transverse waves seconds later.

The speed of a compression wave in a fluid is determined by the medium's [[compressibility]] and [[density]]. In solids, the compression waves are analogous to those in fluids, depending on compressibility and density, but with the additional factor of [[shear modulus]] which affects compression waves due to off-axis elastic energies which are able to influence effective tension and relaxation in a compression. The speed of shear waves, which can occur only in solids, is determined simply by the solid material's shear modulus and density.

==Equations==
The speed of sound in mathematical notation is conventionally represented by ''c'', from the Latin ''celeritas'' meaning "velocity".

For fluids in general, the speed of sound ''c'' is given by the Newton–Laplace equation:
: &lt;math&gt;c = \sqrt{\frac{K_s}{\rho}},&lt;/math&gt;
where
* ''K&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a coefficient of stiffness, the isentropic [[bulk modulus]] (or the modulus of bulk elasticity for gases);
* ''ρ'' is the [[density]].

Thus the speed of sound increases with the stiffness (the resistance of an elastic body to deformation by an applied force) of the material and decreases with an increase in density. For ideal gases, the bulk modulus ''K'' is simply the gas pressure multiplied by the dimensionless [[adiabatic index]], which is about 1.4 for air under normal conditions of pressure and temperature.

For general [[equations of state]], if [[classical mechanics]] is used, the speed of sound ''c'' is given by
: &lt;math&gt;c = \sqrt{\left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial\rho}\right)_s},&lt;/math&gt;
where
* ''p'' is the pressure;
* ''ρ'' is the density and the [[derivative]] is taken isentropically, that is, at constant [[entropy]] ''s''.

If [[special relativity|relativistic]] effects are important, the speed of sound is calculated from the [[relativistic Euler equations]].

In a [[Acoustic dispersion|non-dispersive medium]], the speed of sound is independent of [[sound frequency]], so the speeds of energy transport and sound propagation are the same for all frequencies. Air, a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen, constitutes a non-dispersive medium. However, air does contain a small amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; which ''is'' a dispersive medium, and causes dispersion to air at [[ultrasound|ultrasonic]] frequencies ({{nobreak|&gt; 28 [[kHz]]}}).&lt;ref&gt;Dean, E. A. (August 1979). [http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA076060 Atmospheric Effects on the Speed of Sound], Technical report of Defense Technical Information Center&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[Acoustic dispersion|dispersive medium]], the speed of sound is a function of sound frequency, through the [[dispersion relation]]. Each frequency component propagates at its own speed, called the [[phase velocity]], while the energy of the disturbance propagates at the [[group velocity]]. The same phenomenon occurs with light waves; see [[Dispersion (optics)#Group and phase velocity|optical dispersion]] for a description.

==Dependence on the properties of the medium==
The speed of sound is variable and depends on the properties of the substance through which the wave is travelling. In solids, the speed of transverse (or shear) waves depends on the shear deformation under shear stress (called the [[shear modulus]]), and the density of the medium. Longitudinal (or compression) waves in solids depend on the same two factors with the addition of a dependence on [[compressibility]].

In fluids, only the medium's compressibility and density are the important factors, since fluids do not transmit shear stresses. In heterogeneous fluids, such as a liquid filled with gas bubbles, the density of the liquid and the compressibility of the gas affect the speed of sound in an additive manner, as demonstrated in the [[hot chocolate effect]].

In gases, adiabatic compressibility is directly related to pressure through the [[heat capacity ratio]] (adiabatic index), while pressure and density are inversely related to the temperature and molecular weight, thus making only the completely independent properties of ''temperature and molecular structure'' important (heat capacity ratio may be determined by temperature and molecular structure, but simple molecular weight is not sufficient to determine it).

In low [[molecular weight]] gases such as [[helium]], sound propagates faster as compared to heavier gases such as [[xenon]]. For monatomic gases, the speed of sound is about 75% of the mean speed that the atoms move in that gas.

For a given [[ideal gas]] the molecular composition is fixed, and thus the speed of sound depends only on its [[temperature]]. At a constant temperature, the gas [[pressure]] has no effect on the speed of sound, since the density will increase, and since pressure and [[density]] (also proportional to pressure) have equal but opposite effects on the speed of sound, and the two contributions cancel out exactly. In a similar way, compression waves in solids depend both on compressibility and density—just as in liquids—but in gases the density contributes to the compressibility in such a way that some part of each attribute factors out, leaving only a dependence on temperature, molecular weight, and heat capacity ratio which can be independently derived from temperature and molecular composition (see derivations below). Thus, for a single given gas (assuming the molecular weight does not change) and over a small temperature range (for which the heat capacity is relatively constant), the speed of sound becomes dependent on only the temperature of the gas.

In non-ideal gas behavior regimen, for which the [[Van der Waals equation|van der Waals gas]] equation would be used, the proportionality is not exact, and there is a slight dependence of sound velocity on the gas pressure.

Humidity has a small but measurable effect on the speed of sound (causing it to increase by about 0.1%–0.6%), because [[oxygen]] and [[nitrogen]] molecules of the air are replaced by lighter molecules of [[water]]. This is a simple mixing effect.

==Altitude variation and implications for atmospheric acoustics==
[[File: Comparison US standard atmosphere 1962.svg|thumb|Density and pressure decrease smoothly with altitude, but temperature (red) does not. The speed of sound (blue) depends only on the complicated temperature variation at altitude and can be calculated from it since isolated density and pressure effects on the speed of sound cancel each other. The speed of sound increases with height in two regions of the stratosphere and thermosphere, due to heating effects in these regions.]]

In the [[Earth's atmosphere]], the chief factor affecting the speed of sound is the [[temperature]]. For a given ideal gas with constant heat capacity and composition, the speed of sound is dependent ''solely'' upon temperature; see [[Speed of sound#Details|Details]] below. In such an ideal case, the effects of decreased density and decreased pressure of altitude cancel each other out, save for the residual effect of temperature.

Since temperature (and thus the speed of sound) decreases with increasing altitude up to {{nobreak|11 km}}, sound is [[refraction|refracted]] upward, away from listeners on the ground, creating an [[acoustic shadow]] at some distance from the source.&lt;ref name="Everest2001"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decrease of the speed of sound with height is referred to as a negative [[sound speed gradient]].

However, there are variations in this trend above {{nobreak|11 km}}. In particular, in the [[stratosphere]] above about {{nobreak|20 km}}, the speed of sound increases with height, due to an increase in temperature from heating within the [[ozone layer]]. This produces a positive speed of sound gradient in this region. Still another region of positive gradient occurs at very high altitudes, in the aptly-named [[thermosphere]] above {{nobreak|90 km}}.

==Practical formula for dry air==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}
[[File:Speed of sound in dry air.svg|thumb|Approximation of the speed of sound in dry air based on the [[heat capacity ratio]] (in green) against the truncated [[Taylor expansion]] (in red).]]

The approximate speed of sound in dry (0% humidity) air, in meters per second, at temperatures near {{nobreak|0 °C}}, can be calculated from
: &lt;math&gt;c_{\mathrm{air}} = (331.3 + 0.606 \cdot \vartheta)~~~\mathrm{m/s},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''&lt;math&gt;\vartheta&lt;/math&gt;'' is the temperature in degrees [[Celsius]] (°C).

This equation is derived from the first two terms of the [[Taylor expansion]] of the following more accurate equation:
: &lt;math&gt;c_{\mathrm{air}} = 331.3~ \sqrt{1 + \frac{\vartheta}{273.15}}~~~~\mathrm{m/s}.&lt;/math&gt;

Dividing the first part, and multiplying the second part, on the right hand side, by {{radic|273.15}} gives the exactly equivalent form
: &lt;math&gt;c_{\mathrm{air}} = 20.05~ \sqrt{\vartheta + 273.15}~~~~\mathrm{m/s}.&lt;/math&gt;

which can also be written as
: &lt;math&gt;c_{\mathrm{air}} = 20.05~ \sqrt{T/K}~~~~\mathrm{m/s}&lt;/math&gt;

where T denotes the [[thermodynamic temperature]].

The value of {{nobreak|331.3 m/s}}, which represents the speed at {{nobreak|0 °C}} (or {{nobreak|273.15 K}}), is based on theoretical (and some measured) values of the [[heat capacity ratio]], ''γ'', as well as on the fact that at 1 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]] real air is very well described by the ideal gas approximation. Commonly found values for the speed of sound at {{nobreak|0 °C}} may vary from 331.2 to 331.6 due to the assumptions made when it is calculated. If ideal gas ''γ'' is assumed to be {{nobreak|1=7/5 = 1.4}} exactly, the {{nobreak|0 °C}} speed is calculated (see section below) to be {{nobreak|331.3 m/s}}, the coefficient used above.

This equation is correct to a much wider temperature range, but still depends on the approximation of heat capacity ratio being independent of temperature, and for this reason will fail, particularly at higher temperatures. It gives good predictions in relatively dry, cold, low-pressure conditions, such as the Earth's [[stratosphere]]. The equation fails at extremely low pressures and short wavelengths, due to dependence on the assumption that the wavelength of the sound in the gas is much longer than the average [[mean free path]] between gas molecule collisions. A derivation of these equations will be given in the following section.

A graph comparing results of the two equations is at right, using the slightly different value of {{nobreak|331.5 m/s}} for the speed of sound at {{nobreak|0 °C}}.

==Details==
===Speed of sound in ideal gases and air===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Supersonic]] --&gt;
For an ideal gas, ''K'' (the [[bulk modulus]] in equations above, equivalent to C, the coefficient of stiffness in solids) is given by
: &lt;math&gt;K = \gamma \cdot p,&lt;/math&gt;
thus, from the Newton–Laplace equation above, the speed of sound in an ideal gas is given by
: &lt;math&gt;c = \sqrt{\gamma \cdot {p \over \rho}},&lt;/math&gt;
where
* ''γ'' is the [[adiabatic index]] also known as the ''isentropic expansion factor''. It is the ratio of specific heats of a gas at a constant-pressure to a gas at a constant-volume(&lt;math&gt;C_p/C_v&lt;/math&gt;), and arises because a classical sound wave induces an adiabatic compression, in which the heat of the compression does not have enough time to escape the pressure pulse, and thus contributes to the pressure induced by the compression;
* ''p'' is the [[pressure]];
* ''ρ'' is the [[density]].

Using the [[ideal gas]] law to replace ''p'' with ''nRT''/''V'', and replacing ''ρ'' with ''nM''/''V'', the equation for an ideal gas becomes
: &lt;math&gt;c_{\mathrm{ideal}} = \sqrt{\gamma \cdot {p \over \rho}} = \sqrt{\gamma \cdot R \cdot T \over M} = \sqrt{\gamma \cdot k \cdot T \over m},&lt;/math&gt;
where
* ''c''&lt;sub&gt;ideal&lt;/sub&gt; is the speed of sound in an [[ideal gas]];
* ''R'' (approximately {{nobreak|8.314,5 J · mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; · K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}) is the [[molar gas constant]](universal gas constant);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?r
| title = CODATA Value: molar gas constant
| publisher = Physics.nist.gov
| accessdate = 24 October 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''k'' is the [[Boltzmann constant]];
* ''γ'' (gamma) is the [[adiabatic index]]. At room temperature, where thermal energy is fully partitioned into rotation (rotations are fully excited) but quantum effects prevent excitation of vibrational modes, the value is {{nobreak|1=7/5 = 1.400}} for diatomic molecules, according to kinetic theory. Gamma is actually experimentally measured over a range from 1.399,1 to 1.403 at {{nobreak|0 °C}}, for air. Gamma is exactly {{nobreak|1=5/3 = 1.6667}} for monatomic gases such as [[noble gas]]es;
* ''T'' is the absolute temperature;
* ''M'' is the molar mass of the gas. The mean molar mass for dry air is about {{nobreak|0.028,964,5 kg/mol}};{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}
* ''n'' is the number of moles;
* ''m'' is the mass of a single molecule.

This equation applies only when the sound wave is a small perturbation on the ambient condition, and the certain other noted conditions are fulfilled, as noted below. Calculated values for ''c''&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt; have been found to vary slightly from experimentally determined values.&lt;ref name=USSA1976&gt;U.S. Standard Atmosphere, 1976, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C., 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Isaac Newton|Newton]] famously considered the speed of sound before most of the development of [[thermodynamics]] and so incorrectly used [[isothermal]] calculations instead of [[adiabatic]]. His result was missing the factor of ''γ'' but was otherwise correct.

Numerical substitution of the above values gives the ideal gas approximation of sound velocity for gases, which is accurate at relatively low gas pressures and densities (for air, this includes standard Earth sea-level conditions). Also, for diatomic gases the use of {{nobreak|1=''γ'' = 1.4000}} requires that the gas exists in a temperature range high enough that rotational heat capacity is fully excited (i.e., molecular rotation is fully used as a heat energy "partition" or reservoir); but at the same time the temperature must be low enough that molecular vibrational modes contribute no heat capacity (i.e., insignificant heat goes into vibration, as all vibrational quantum modes above the minimum-energy-mode, have energies too high to be populated by a significant number of molecules at this temperature). For air, these conditions are fulfilled at room temperature, and also temperatures considerably below room temperature (see tables below). See the section on gases in [[specific heat capacity]] for a more complete discussion of this phenomenon.

For air, we introduce the shorthand
: &lt;math&gt;R_* = R/M_{\mathrm{air}}.&lt;/math&gt;
In addition, we switch to the Celsius temperature {{nobreak|1=''&lt;math&gt;\vartheta&lt;/math&gt;'' = ''T'' − 273.15}}, which is useful to calculate air speed in the region near 
0°C (about 273 kelvin).  Then, for dry air,
: &lt;math&gt;c_{\mathrm{ideal}} = \sqrt{\gamma \cdot R_* \cdot T} = \sqrt{\gamma \cdot R_* \cdot (\vartheta + 273.15)},&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;c_{\mathrm{ideal}} = \sqrt{\gamma \cdot R_* \cdot 273.15} \cdot \sqrt{1 + \frac{\vartheta}{273.15}},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''&lt;math&gt;\vartheta&lt;/math&gt;'' (theta) is the temperature in degrees [[Celsius]](°C).

Substituting numerical values 
: &lt;math&gt;R = 8.314\,510~\mathrm{J/(mol \cdot K)}&lt;/math&gt;
for the molar [[gas constant]] in J/mole/Kelvin, and
: &lt;math&gt;M_{\mathrm{air}} = 0.028\,964\,5~\mathrm{kg/mol}&lt;/math&gt;
for the mean molar mass of air, in kg; and using the ideal diatomic gas value of {{nobreak|1=''γ'' = 1.4000}}, we have
: &lt;math&gt;c_{\mathrm{air}} = 331.3~~ \sqrt{1 + \frac{\vartheta}{273.15}}~~~\mathrm{m/s}.&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, Taylor expansion of the remaining square root in &lt;math&gt;\vartheta&lt;/math&gt; yields
: &lt;math&gt;c_{\mathrm{air}} = 331.3~(1 + \frac{\vartheta}{2 \cdot 273.15})~~~\mathrm{m/s},&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;c_{\mathrm{air}} = (331.3 + 0.606 \cdot \vartheta)~~~\mathrm{m/s}.&lt;/math&gt;

The above derivation includes the first two equations given in the "Practical formula for dry air" section above.

===Effects due to wind shear===
The speed of sound varies with temperature. Since temperature and sound velocity normally decrease with increasing altitude, sound is [[refraction|refracted]] upward, away from listeners on the ground, creating an [[acoustic shadow]] at some distance from the source.&lt;ref name="Everest2001" /&gt; Wind shear of 4 m/(s · km) can produce refraction equal to a typical temperature [[lapse rate]] of {{nobreak|7.5 °C/km}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In fact, assuming an [[ideal gas]], the speed of sound ''c'' depends on temperature only, '''not on the pressure''' or '''density''' (since these change in lockstep for a given temperature and cancel out). Air is almost an ideal gas. The temperature of the air varies with altitude, giving the following variations in the speed of sound using the standard atmosphere—''actual conditions may vary''.

==Effect of frequency and gas composition==

===General physical considerations===
The medium in which a sound wave is travelling does not always respond adiabatically, and as a result, the speed of sound can vary with frequency.&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Beaumont Wood|A B Wood]], A Textbook of Sound (Bell, London, 1946)&lt;/ref&gt;

The limitations of the concept of speed of sound due to extreme attenuation are also of concern. The attenuation which exists at sea level for high frequencies applies to successively lower frequencies as atmospheric pressure decreases, or as the [[mean free path]] increases. For this reason, the concept of speed of sound (except for frequencies approaching zero) progressively loses its range of applicability at high altitudes.&lt;ref name="USSA1976"/&gt; The standard equations for the speed of sound apply with reasonable accuracy only to situations in which the wavelength of the soundwave is considerably longer than the mean free path of molecules in a gas.

The molecular composition of the gas contributes both as the mass (M) of the molecules, and their heat capacities, and so both have an influence on speed of sound. In general, at the same molecular mass, monatomic gases have slightly higher speed of sound (over 9% higher) because they have a higher ''γ'' ({{nobreak|1=5/3 = 1.66}}…) than diatomics do ({{nobreak|1=7/5 = 1.4}}). Thus, at the same molecular mass, the speed of sound of a monatomic gas goes up by a factor of
: &lt;math&gt;{c_{\mathrm{gas,monatomic}} \over c_{\mathrm{gas,diatomic}}} = \sqrt{{{{5/3} \over {7/5}}}} = \sqrt{25 \over 21} = 1.091\ldots&lt;/math&gt;

This gives the 9% difference, and would be a typical ratio for speeds of sound at room temperature in [[helium]] vs. [[deuterium]], each with a molecular weight of 4. Sound travels faster in helium than deuterium because adiabatic compression heats helium more since the helium molecules can store heat energy from compression only in translation, but not rotation. Thus helium molecules (monatomic molecules) travel faster in a sound wave and transmit sound faster. (Sound travels at about 70% of the mean molecular speed in gases; the figure is 75% in monatomic gases and 68% in diatomic gases).

Note that in this example we have assumed that temperature is low enough that heat capacities are not influenced by molecular vibration (see [[heat capacity]]). However, vibrational modes simply cause gammas which decrease toward 1, since vibration modes in a polyatomic gas give the gas additional ways to store heat which do not affect temperature, and thus do not affect molecular velocity and sound velocity. Thus, the effect of higher temperatures and vibrational heat capacity acts to increase the difference between the speed of sound in monatomic vs. polyatomic molecules, with the speed remaining greater in monatomics.

===Practical application to air===
By far the most important factor influencing the speed of sound in air is temperature. The speed is proportional to the square root of the absolute temperature, giving an increase of about {{nobreak|0.6 m/s}} per degree Celsius. For this reason, the pitch of a musical wind instrument increases as its temperature increases.

The speed of sound is raised by humidity but decreased by carbon dioxide. The difference between 0% and 100% humidity is about {{nobreak|1.5 m/s}} at standard pressure and temperature, but the size of the humidity effect increases dramatically with temperature. The carbon dioxide content of air is not fixed, due to both carbon pollution and human breath (e.g., in the air blown through wind instruments).

The dependence on frequency and pressure are normally insignificant in practical applications. In dry air, the speed of sound increases by about {{nobreak|0.1 m/s}} as the frequency rises from {{nobreak|10 Hz}} to {{nobreak|100 Hz}}. For audible frequencies above {{nobreak|100 Hz}} it is relatively constant. Standard values of the speed of sound are quoted in the limit of low frequencies, where the wavelength is large compared to the mean free path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Mach number==
{{main article|Mach number}}
[[File:FA-18 Hornet breaking sound barrier (7 July 1999) - filtered.jpg|right|thumb|U.S. Navy [[F/A-18 Hornet|F/A-18]] traveling near the speed of sound. The white halo consists of condensed water droplets formed by the sudden drop in air pressure behind the shock cone around the aircraft (see [[Prandtl-Glauert singularity]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite APOD

}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Mach number, a useful quantity in aerodynamics, is the ratio of air [[speed]] to the local speed of sound. At altitude, for reasons explained, Mach number is a function of temperature.
Aircraft [[flight instruments]], however, operate using pressure differential to compute Mach number, not temperature. The assumption is that a particular pressure represents a particular altitude and, therefore, a standard temperature. Aircraft flight instruments need to operate this way because the stagnation pressure sensed by a [[Pitot tube]] is dependent on altitude as well as speed.

==Experimental methods==
A range of different methods exist for the measurement of sound in air.

The earliest reasonably accurate estimate of the speed of sound in air was made by [[William Derham]] and acknowledged by [[Isaac Newton]]. Derham had a telescope at the top of the tower of the [[Church of St Laurence, Upminster|Church of St Laurence]] in [[Upminster]], England. On a calm day, a synchronized pocket watch would be given to an assistant who would fire a shotgun at a pre-determined time from a conspicuous point some miles away, across the countryside. This could be confirmed by telescope. He then measured the interval between seeing gunsmoke and arrival of the sound using a half-second pendulum. The distance from where the gun was fired was found by triangulation, and simple division (distance/time) provided velocity. Lastly, by making many observations, using a range of different distances, the inaccuracy of the half-second pendulum could be averaged out, giving his final estimate of the speed of sound. Modern stopwatches enable this method to be used today over distances as short as 200–400 meters, and not needing something as loud as a shotgun.

===Single-shot timing methods===
The simplest concept is the measurement made using two [[microphone]]s and a fast recording device such as a [[Digital data|digital]] storage scope. This method uses the following idea.

If a sound source and two microphones are arranged in a straight line, with the sound source at one end, then the following can be measured:
# The distance between the microphones (''x''), called microphone basis.
# The time of arrival between the signals (delay) reaching the different microphones (''t'').

Then ''v'' = ''x''/''t''.

===Other methods===
In these methods, the [[time]] measurement has been replaced by a measurement of the inverse of time ([[frequency]]).

[[Kundt's tube]] is an example of an experiment which can be used to measure the speed of sound in a small volume. It has the advantage of being able to measure the speed of sound in any gas. This method uses a powder to make the [[Node (physics)|nodes]] and [[antinode]]s visible to the human eye. This is an example of a compact experimental setup.

A [[tuning fork]] can be held near the mouth of a long [[pipe (material)|pipe]] which is dipping into a barrel of [[water]]. In this system it is the case that the pipe can be brought to resonance if the length of the air column in the pipe is equal to ''(1 + 2''n'')λ/4'' where ''n'' is an integer. As the [[antinode|antinodal]] point for the pipe at the open end is slightly outside the mouth of the pipe it is best to find two or more points of resonance and then measure half a wavelength between these.

Here it is the case that ''v'' = ''fλ''.

===High-precision measurements in air===
The effect of impurities can be significant when making high-precision measurements. Chemical [[desiccant]]s can be used to dry the air, but will, in turn, contaminate the sample. The air can be dried cryogenically, but this has the effect of removing the carbon dioxide as well; therefore many high-precision measurements are performed with air free of carbon dioxide rather than with natural air. A 2002 review&lt;ref&gt;Zuckerwar, Handbook of the speed of sound in real gases, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; found that a 1963 measurement by Smith and Harlow using a cylindrical resonator gave "the most probable value of the standard speed of sound to date." The experiment was done with air from which the carbon dioxide had been removed, but the result was then corrected for this effect so as to be applicable to real air. The experiments were done at {{nobreak|30 °C}} but corrected for temperature in order to report them at {{nobreak|0 °C}}. The result was {{nobreak|331.45 ± 0.01 m/s}} for dry air at STP, for frequencies from {{nobreak|93 Hz}} to {{nobreak|1,500 Hz}}.

==Non-gaseous media==

===Speed of sound in solids===

====Three-dimensional solids====
In a solid, there is a non-zero stiffness both for volumetric deformations and shear deformations. Hence, it is possible to generate sound waves with different velocities dependent
on the deformation mode. Sound waves generating volumetric deformations (compression) and shear deformations (shearing) are called pressure waves (longitudinal waves) and shear waves (transverse waves), respectively. In [[earthquake]]s, the corresponding seismic waves are called [[P-wave]]s (primary waves) and [[S-wave]]s (secondary waves), respectively. The sound velocities of these two types of waves propagating in a homogeneous 3-dimensional solid are respectively given by&lt;ref name="E. Kinsler 2000"&gt;L. E. Kinsler et al. (2000), ''Fundamentals of acoustics'', 4th Ed., John Wiley and sons Inc., New York, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;c_{\mathrm{solid,p}} = \sqrt{\frac{K + \frac{4}{3}G}{\rho}} = \sqrt{\frac{E(1 - \nu)}{\rho (1 + \nu)(1 - 2 \nu)}},&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;c_{\mathrm{solid,s}} = \sqrt{\frac{G}{\rho}},&lt;/math&gt;
where
* ''K'' is the [[bulk modulus]] of the elastic materials;
* ''G'' is the [[shear modulus]] of the elastic materials;
* ''E'' is the [[Young's modulus]];
* ''ρ'' is the density;
* ''ν'' is [[Poisson's ratio]].

The last quantity is not an independent one, as {{nobreak|1=E = 3K(1 − 2ν)}}. Note that the speed of pressure waves depends both on the pressure and shear resistance properties of the material, while the speed of shear waves depends on the shear properties only.

Typically, pressure waves travel faster in materials than do shear waves, and in earthquakes this is the reason that the onset of an earthquake is often preceded by a quick upward-downward shock, before arrival of waves that produce a side-to-side motion. For example, for a typical steel alloy, {{nobreak|1=''K'' = 170 GPa}}, {{nobreak|1=''G'' = 80 GPa}} and {{nobreak|1=''ρ'' = 7,700 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}, yielding a compressional speed ''c''&lt;sub&gt;solid,p&lt;/sub&gt; of {{nobreak|6,000 m/s}}.&lt;ref name="E. Kinsler 2000"/&gt; This is in reasonable agreement with ''c''&lt;sub&gt;solid,p&lt;/sub&gt; measured experimentally at {{nobreak|5,930 m/s}} for a (possibly different) type of steel.&lt;ref&gt;J. Krautkrämer and H. Krautkrämer (1990), ''Ultrasonic testing of materials'', 4th fully revised edition, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany, p. 497&lt;/ref&gt; The shear speed ''c''&lt;sub&gt;solid,s&lt;/sub&gt; is estimated at {{nobreak|3,200 m/s}} using the same numbers.

====One-dimensional solids====
The speed of sound for pressure waves in stiff materials such as metals is sometimes given for "long rods" of the material in question, in which the speed is easier to measure. In rods where their diameter is shorter than a wavelength, the speed of pure pressure waves may be simplified and is given by:
: &lt;math&gt;c_{\mathrm{solid}} = \sqrt{\frac{E}{\rho}},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''E'' is [[Young's modulus]]. This is similar to the expression for shear waves, save that [[Young's modulus]] replaces the [[shear modulus]]. This speed of sound for pressure waves in long rods will always be slightly less than the same speed in homogeneous 3-dimensional solids, and the ratio of the speeds in the two different types of objects depends on [[Poisson's ratio]] for the material.

===Speed of sound in liquids===
[[File: Speed of sound in water.svg|thumb|right|Speed of sound in water vs temperature.]]
In a fluid, the only non-zero [[stiffness]] is to volumetric deformation (a fluid does not sustain shear forces).

Hence the speed of sound in a fluid is given by
: &lt;math&gt;c_{\mathrm{fluid}} = \sqrt{\frac{K}{\rho}},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''K'' is the [[bulk modulus]] of the fluid.

====Water====
In fresh water, sound travels at about {{nobreak|1481 m/s}} at {{nobreak|20 °C}} (see the External Links section below for online calculators).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In salt water that is free of air bubbles or suspended sediment, sound travels at about {{nobreak|1500 m/s}} ({{nobreak|1500.235 m/s}} at {{nobreak|1000 [[kilopascals]]}}, 10{{nbsp}}°C and 3% [[salinity]] by one method).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wong|first1=George S.

Since in most ocean regions temperature decreases with depth, the profile of the speed of sound with depth decreases to a minimum at a depth of several hundred meters.  Below the minimum, sound speed increases again, as the effect of increasing pressure overcomes the effect of decreasing temperature (right).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

where
* ''T'' is the temperature in degrees Celsius;
* ''S'' is the salinity in parts per thousand;

The constants ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; are

This equation has a standard error of {{nobreak|0.070 m/s}} for salinity between 25 and 40 [[Parts per thousand|ppt]]. See [http://www.npl.co.uk/acoustics/techguides/soundseawater/ Technical Guides. Speed of Sound in Sea-Water] for an online calculator.

(Note: The Sound Speed vs. Depth graph does ''not'' correlate directly to the MacKenzie formula.
This is due to the fact that the temperature and salinity varies at different depths.
When T and S are held constant, the formula itself it always increasing.)

===Speed of sound in plasma===
The speed of sound in a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] for the common case that the electrons are hotter than the ions (but not too much hotter) is given by the formula (see [[Plasma parameters#Velocities|here]])
: &lt;math&gt;c_s = (\gamma ZkT_\mathrm{e}/m_\mathrm{i})^{1/2} = 9.79 \times 10^3(\gamma ZT_e/\mu)^{1/2}~\mathrm{m/s},&lt;/math&gt;
where
* ''m''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[ion]] mass;
* ''μ'' is the ratio of ion mass to [[proton]] mass {{nobreak|1=''μ'' = ''m''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;/''m''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;}};
* ''T''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[electron]] temperature;
* ''Z'' is the charge state;
* ''k'' is [[Boltzmann constant]];
* ''γ'' is the [[adiabatic index]].

In contrast to a gas, the pressure and the density are provided by separate species, the pressure by the electrons and the density by the ions. The two are coupled through a fluctuating electric field.

==Gradients==
{{main article|Sound speed gradient}}
When sound spreads out evenly in all directions in three dimensions, the intensity drops in proportion to the inverse square of the distance. However, in the ocean, there is a layer called the 'deep sound channel' or [[SOFAR channel]] which can confine sound waves at a particular depth.

In the SOFAR channel, the speed of sound is lower than that in the layers above and below. Just as light waves will refract towards a region of higher [[refractive index|index]], sound waves will [[refraction|refract]] towards a region where their speed is reduced. The result is that sound gets confined in the layer, much the way light can be confined to a sheet of glass or [[optical fiber]]. Thus, the sound is confined in essentially two dimensions. In two dimensions the intensity drops in proportion to only the inverse of the distance. This allows waves to travel much further before being undetectably faint.

A similar effect occurs in the atmosphere. [[Project Mogul]] successfully used this effect to detect a [[nuclear explosion]] at a considerable distance.

A '''sucker rod''' is a [[steel]] rod, typically between 25 and 30 feet (7 to 9 meters) in length, and [[Screw thread|threaded]] at both ends, used in the [[oil industry]] to join together the surface and [[wikt:downhole|downhole]] components of a reciprocating piston pump installed in an oil well. The [[pumpjack]] is the visible above-ground drive for the well pump, and is connected to the downhole pump at the bottom of the well by a series of interconnected sucker rods. Sucker rods are also commonly available made of fiberglass in 37 1/2 foot lengths and diameters of 3/4, 7/8, 1, and 1 1/4 inch. These are terminated in metallic threaded ends, female at one end and male at the other.

The surface unit transfers energy for pumping the well from the prime-mover to the sucker rod string. In doing this, it must change the rotary motion of the prime-mover to reciprocating motion for the sucker rod. And it must reduce the speed of the prime-mover to a suitable pumping speed. Speed reduction is accomplished by using a gear reducer, and rotary motion of the crank shaft is converted to oscillatory motion by means of a walking beam. The crank arm is connected to the walking beam by means of a pitman arm. The walking beam is supported by a Samson post and saddle bearing. The horse head and bridle are used to ensure that the pull on the sucker rod string is vertical all times so that no bearing movement is applied to that part of sucker rod string above stuffing box. The polished rod and stuffing box combination is used to maintain a good liquid seal at the surface.

'''''The Dragon in the Sea''''' (1956), also known as '''''Under Pressure''''' from its serialization, is a novel by [[Frank Herbert]]. It was first serialized in ''[[Astounding Science Fiction|Astounding]]'' magazine from 1955 to 1956, then reworked&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/fherbert.htm |title=Frank (Patrick) Herbert |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427010107/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/fherbert.htm |archivedate=27 April 2014 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and published as a book in 1956. (A 1961 2nd printing of the Avon paperback, catalog # G-1092, was titled '''''21st Century Sub''''' with the original title in parentheses.) It is usually classified as a [[psychological novel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nndb.com/people/717/000023648/ "Frank Herbert" - nnbd.com] "The book showcased his interest in human psychology, especially as applied to power and leadership, and it also predicted, by two decades, the political ramifications of oil dependency and production."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
In a near-future earth, the West and the East have been at war for more than a decade, and resources are running thin.  The West is stealing oil from the East with specialized [[Nuclear Submarine|nuclear submarines]] ("subtugs") that sneak into the underwater oil fields of the East to secretly pump out the oil and bring it back.  Each manned by a crew of four, these submarines undertake the most hazardous, stressful mission conceivable, and of late, the missions have been failing, with the last twenty submarines simply disappearing.

The East has been very successful in planting sleepers in the West's military and command structures, and the suspicion is that sleepers are sabotaging the subs or revealing their positions once at sea.  John Ramsey, a young psychologist from the Bureau of Psychology (BuPsych), is trained as an electronics operator and sent on the next mission, replacing the previous officer who went insane.  His secret mission is to find the sleeper, or figure out why the crews are going insane.

==Major themes==
Typically for Herbert, psychology and religion (the title comes from  a quote from the ''[[Book of Revelation]]'') play a large role in the narrative, as John Ramsey comes to understand the nature of the subtug crews and how they carry out their missions.

The technology of the submarines towing large bags filled with the surreptitiously pumped oil described in the books may have been an inspiration for the invention called the ''[[Dracone]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Frank Herbert |last=O'Reilly |first=Timothy |authorlink=Tim O'Reilly |year=1981 |publisher=Frederick Ungar Publishing Co., Inc |chapter=Chapter 2: Under Pressure|url=http://tim.oreilly.com/herbert/ch02.html |accessdate=2009-05-09 |quote=[the name was an] overt acknowledgment of the source of [the] idea}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Papers of Sir William Hawthorne | url=http://janus.lib.cam.ac.uk/db/node.xsp?id=EAD%2FGBR%2F0014%2FHATN%204 | work=Janus | accessdate=2009-05-09 |quote=christened ''Dracone'' [because it was] the nearest word in Greek for a mythical monster such as a sea serpent}}&lt;/ref&gt; for which development started in the year following Herbert's serial.

==Reception==
''[[Galaxy Science Fiction|Galaxy]]'' reviewer Floyd C. Gale praised ''Dragon in the Sea'' as "a dramatically fascinating story. . . . [a] tense and well-written novel."&lt;ref&gt;"Galaxy's 5 Star Shelf", ''Galaxy Science Fiction'', July 1955, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; [[Algis Budrys]] described it as "hypnotically fascinating," praising Herbert's "intelligence, sophistication, [and] capacity for research" as well as his "ability to write clean prose as an unobtrusive but effective vehicle for a cleanly told story."&lt;ref name="budrys196604"&gt;{{Cite magazine

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12571">The concept of '''transformity''' was first introduced by [[David M. Scienceman]] in collaboration with [[Howard T. Odum]]. In 1987 Scienceman proposed that the phrases, "[[energy quality]]", "energy quality factor", and "energy transformation ratio", all used by H.T.Odum, be replaced by the word "transformity" (p.&amp;nbsp;261). This approach aims to solve a long standing issue about the relation of qualitative phenomena to quantitative phenomena often analysed in the physical sciences, which in turn is a synthesis of rationalism with [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]. That is to say that it aims to quantify quality.

==Transformity: the rationalization of quality ==
=== Definition of transformity in words ===

Scienceman then defined transformity as,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"a quantitative variable describing the measurable property of a form of energy, its ability to amplify as feedback, relative to the source energy consumed in its formation, '''''under maximum power conditions'''''. As a quantitative variable analogous to thermodynamic temperature, transformity requires specification of units." (1987, p. 261. My emphasis).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In 1996 H.T.Odum defined transformity as,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''"the [[emergy]] of one type required to make a unit of energy of another type. For example, since 3 coal emjoules (cej) of coal and 1 cej of services are required to generate 1 J of electricity, the coal transformity of electricity is 4 cej/J"'''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
G.P.Genoni expanded on this definition and maintained that, "the energy input of one kind required to sustain one unit of energy of another kind, is used to quantify [[Energy quality#Ranking energy quality|hierarchical position]]" (1997, p.&amp;nbsp;97). According to Scienceman, the concept of transformity introduces a new basic dimension into physics (1987, p.&amp;nbsp;261). However there is ambiguity in the dimensional analysis of transformity as Bastianoni et al. (2007) state that transformity is a dimensionless ratio.

=== Definition as a ratio ===

One part of the [[rationalism|rationalist]] viewpoint associated with [[modernity]] and [[science]] is to contrast qualitatively different phenomena under transformation through quantitative ratios, with the aim of uncovering any constancy amidst the transformation change. Like the [[mechanical efficiency|efficiency]] ratio, transformity is quantitatively defined by a simple input-output ratio. However the transformity ratio is the inverse of efficiency and involves both indirect and direct energy flows rather than simply direct input-output energy ratio of energy efficiency. This is to say that it is defined as the ratio of emergy input to [[energy]] output.

'''Original version:''': &lt;math&gt;\mbox{Transformity} = \frac{\mbox{emergy input}}{\mbox{energy output}}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Development ===

However, it was realised that the term "energy output" refers to both the ''useful'' energy output '''and''' the ''non-useful'' energy output. (Note: that as given by P.K.Nag, an alternative name for 'useful energy' is 'availability' or '''[[exergy]]''', and an alternative name for 'non-useful energy' is 'unavailability', or '''anergy''' (Nag 1984, p.&amp;nbsp;156)). But as E.Sciubba and S.Ulgiati observed, the notion of transformity meant to capture the emergy invested per unit product, or useful output. The concept of Transformity was therefore further specified as the ratio of "input emergy dissipated (availability used up)" to the "unit output exergy" (Sciubba and Ulgiati 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;1957). For Jørgensen (2000, p.&amp;nbsp;61) transformity is a strong indicator of the efficiency of the system.

'''Revised version''': &lt;math&gt;\mbox{Transformity} = \frac{\mbox{emergy input}}{\mbox{exergy output}} &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;Tr = \frac{E_m}{E_x}&lt;/math&gt;
(after Giannantoni 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;8).

Substituting in the mathematical definition of emergy given in that article.

:&lt;math&gt;
Tr = \frac {\int_{t=-\infty}^{t_0} P_x \, dt}{E_x}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Contemporary development==
===Two transformities===

Albertina Lourenci  and  João Antonio Zuffo from the Department of Electronic Systems Engineering at [[São Paulo]] have posited that there are two transformity values; &lt;math&gt;Tr_{ex}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Tr_{theta}&lt;/math&gt; (Lourenci and Zuffo 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;411).

* &lt;math&gt;Tr_{ex}&lt;/math&gt;: compensates for the dissipation of exergy, and is defined in words as the Quality Factor which takes into account the emerging Quality associated to other forms of Energy
* &lt;math&gt;Tr_{theta}&lt;/math&gt;: accounts for the increase of Transformity as a consequence of the Emergy generated by the Source Terms of the Universe

{{cquote|We may assert that while the term &lt;math&gt;Tr_{ex}&lt;/math&gt; takes into account the quantitative aspect of information, 
the term &lt;math&gt;Tr_{theta}&lt;/math&gt; accounts for the Quality aspect of such information.}}

Under these definitions "emergy" can always be structured as follows:

&lt;math&gt;Em_U= Tr_{theta}.Tr_{ex}.Ex_U&lt;/math&gt;

'''Tree-free paper''' or tree-free [[newsprint]] describes an alternative to [[wood-pulp paper]] by its [[raw material]] composition. It is claimed to be more [[environmentally friendly|eco-friendly]] considering the product's [[life cycle assessment|entire life cycle]].

Sources of fiber for tree-free paper include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://treefreepaper.com/treefree101.php|title=Treefree 101|accessdate=2008-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* agricultural residues (e.g. [[Bagasse|sugarcane bagasse]], [[husk]]s and [[straw]])
* [[fiber crop]]s and wild plants, such as [[bamboo]], [[kenaf]], [[hemp]], [[jute]], and [[flax]]
* [[textile]]s and [[Rope|cordage]] wastes

Non-fibre sources include:

* [[calcium carbonate]] bound by a non-toxic [[high-density polyethylene]] resin

[[Paper manufacturing]] is highly competitive, with historically tight margins and small operating profits. As a result, the raw materials used to make paper have to be very cost effective, using cheap, scalable renewable resources, coupled with relatively inexpensive ways to deliver large quantities to market. Until recently,{{when|date=January 2013}} commercial tree farming, has been shaped to account for these tight operating margins and supply cost limitations. Virtually all paper, however, requires massive [[logging|cutting]], [[replanting]] and re-cutting of wide swaths of forest. These limitations have made wood pulped farm grown supply stock the paper industry's overwhelming scalable raw material of choice.

The paper industry's answer to "tree free" paper has been focused on "[[paper recycling|recycled]] [[waste paper]]" as a tree free alternative even though the vast majority of "recycled waste paper" originally started its life cycle from tree grown pulp.

Fiber dense agricultural residues, have been known as a pulp substitute for years.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} Commercial low cost production technology coupled with limited resource abundancy plus low cost transportation to commercial business markets had created a barrier, virtually relegating true "tree free" paper from developing into anything more than small niche markets with even smaller niche market players. Furthermore, grasses and annual plants often have high [[silica]] contents. Silica is problematic as it consumes pulping chemicals and produces [[fly ash]] when burned.

The '''Waag''' ("[[weigh house]]") is a 15th-century building on [[Nieuwmarkt]] square in [[Amsterdam]]. It was originally a [[city gate]] and part of the [[walls of Amsterdam]]. The building has also served as a [[guildhall]], [[museum]], [[fire station]] and [[anatomical theatre]], among other things.

The Waag is the oldest remaining non-religious building in Amsterdam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waag.org/genericcontent/gebouw "History of the Waag building", Waag Society]&lt;/ref&gt; The building has held ''[[rijksmonument]]'' status since 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[http://monumentenregister.cultureelerfgoed.nl/php/main.php?cAction=show&amp;cOffset=0&amp;cLimit=25&amp;cOBJnr=3848&amp;oOrder=ASC&amp;cLast=1&amp;oField=OBJ_RIJKSNUMMER&amp;sCompMonNr=3848&amp;sCompMonName=&amp;sStatus=&amp;sProvincie=&amp;sGemeente=&amp;sPlaats=&amp;sStraat=&amp;sHuisnummer=&amp;sPostcode=&amp;sFunctie=&amp;sHoofdcategorie=&amp;sSubcategorie=&amp;sOmschrijving=&amp;ID=0&amp;oField=OBJ_RIJKSNUMMER "Monumentnummer: 3848, Nieuwmarkt 4 1012 CR te Amsterdam", Monumentenregister, Rijksdienst voor het Cultureel Erfgoed] (Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Waag is depicted in [[Rembrandt]]'s 1632 painting ''[[The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp]]''. The [[Barber surgeon|surgeons]]' guild commissioned this painting for their guildhall in the Waag.

=== City gate ===
Originally, the building was one of the gates in the city wall, the '''Sint Antoniespoort''' (Saint Anthony's Gate). The gate was located at the end of the [[Zeedijk]] [[levee|dike]], which continued beyond the gate as the Sint Antoniesdijk. After the [[Lastage]] area was added to the city in the 16th century, the Sint Antoniesdijk became the [[Sint Antoniesbreestraat]] and a new Sint Antoniespoort city gate was built near the [[Hortus Botanicus (Amsterdam)|Hortus Botanicus]].

The city gate was part of the medieval city walls along the  [[moat]] formed by the current [[Singel (Amsterdam)|Singel]] canal and the canals of the [[Kloveniersburgwal]] and the [[Geldersekade]]. These walls were constructed during the period 1481–1494 and consisted of defensive towers and city gates connected by walls of brick with a natural stone pediment. All that remains of the walls is some [[sandstone]] in the Geldersekade canal wall. The only remains of the city gates are the Waag and part of the Regulierspoort gate, which is now the bottom half of the [[Munttoren]] tower. The [[Schreierstoren]] is the only remaining defensive tower.

The oldest [[gable stone]] in Amsterdam adorns the facade of the tower at the corner of Zeedijk and Geldersekade. It carries the inscription ''MCCCCLXXXVIII de XXVIII dach in April wart d'eerste steen van dese poert gheleit.'' ("The first stone of this gate was laid on 28 April 1488"). The year of construction 1488, as given on the gable stone and in many sources, may not actually be correct. There are clues that the gate may be of a much older date. For instance, there are several documents in the city archives of Amsterdam that pre-date 1488 and mention Saint Anthony's Gate. According to building archaeologist Jacqueline de Graauw, the building probably dates back to as early as 1425, because that is when the city was expanded and the Geldersekade and Kloveniersburgwal canals, at which the gate was placed, were dug.&lt;ref&gt;"Het veelbewogen leven van een stokoud gebouw", ''Het Parool'', 22 January 2011 (Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt;

De Graauw also found that Saint Anthony's Gate was originally much smaller, and was heightened at a later date. This is evident from the remains of [[merlon]]s halfway up the towers of the Guild of Saint Eligius and the ''[[schutterij|schuttersgilde]]'' (militia) - the two big towers on either side of the main gate. Also, the front gate, which differs from the main gate in several ways, was probably added to the main gate at a later date. These kinds of additions were commonplace at that time, as a protection against the increasing threat posed by canons. In Haarlem, for example, a front gate was added to the [[Amsterdamse Poort, Haarlem|Amsterdam Gate]] in 1482 which is very similar to the front gate of Saint Anthony's Gate. Presumably the gable stone in Saint Anthony's Gate with the date 1488 refers simply to the addition of the front gate to the already existing main gate.&lt;ref&gt;DE GRAAUW, J.. De middeleeuwse bouwgeschiedenis van de Amsterdamse Sint-Anthonispoort. De Waag op de Nieuwmarkt nader onderzocht. Bulletin KNOB 110, sept. 2011. Available at: &lt; http://bulletin.knob.nl/article/view/109&gt;. Date of use: April 20th, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

From around the beginning of the 16th century, when Amsterdam had completed its surrounding stone city wall, Saint Anthony's Gate appeared as it is depicted in the wood carvings of [[Cornelis Anthonisz]]: a main gate with four towers on the inner (city) side — of which the masons' guild tower  was still small — and a front gate with two towers on the outer (canal) side. Between the front gate and main gate, there was a small square covering a subterraneous [[sluice|sluice gate]]. The walls of the towers are almost 2 metres thick.

When the city expanded beyond its walls the late 16th century, Saint Anthony's Gate lost its function as a city gate. Shortly thereafter, during the years 1603–1613, the walls were demolished. In 1614, the present Nieuwmarkt square was created by covering the canal on either side of the gate. In addition, the square was raised, causing part of the brickwork of the gate to disappear below ground. This makes the building appear shorter than it actually is.

===Weigh house===
In 1617, the former city gate was repurposed as a [[weigh house]], a public building where various goods were weighed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://waag.org/en/de-waag-building |title=Waag Society |accessdate=13 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This new weigh house was needed to relieve the ''Waag op de Dam'', the original weigh house on [[Dam (Amsterdam)|Dam]] square, which had become too small for the needs of the rapidly growing city.

An inner courtyard was added in 1617–1618 by covering the area between the front and main gates. A number of [[guild]]s were housed on the top floors of the building: the [[blacksmith]]s' guild, the [[painter's guild]], the [[Stonemasonry|masons]]' guild and the [[Barber surgeon|surgeons]]' guild. Each guild had its own entrance gate. The guild emblems are still visible over these entrances. The gate of the masons' guild includes sculpture work by [[Hendrick de Keyser]]. Over the entrance for the surgeons' guild is the inscription ''Theatrum Anatomicum''.

In 1690–1691, a large dome-shaped hall was added, topped by a central octagonal tower. The interior also dates to this time period.

The Waag eventually lost its function as a weigh house. In 1819, a chest of indigo was the last item to be weighed there.

===19th and 20th centuries===
After falling into disuse as a weigh house, the Waag served a range of different functions. In the 19th century it was used consecutively as a fencing hall, a furniture workshop, a workshop for oil lamps used for street lighting, a fire station, and as the city archives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indewaag.nl/?Gebouw Restaurant - Café In De Waag] (Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt; In the first half of the 19th century, punishments were carried out in front of the building. There was even a [[guillotine]].

In the 20th century, the building was used primarily as a museum. It was the original location of the Amsterdams Historisch Museum (now [[Amsterdam Museum]]) as well as the [[Joods Historisch Museum]] (Jewish Historical Museum). In the period 1989–1994, the building was not used and stood empty. Eventually the building was handed over to a foundation, Stichting Centrum De Waag, which commissioned [[Philippe Starck]]  to design a glass extension that would have required part of the outer wall to be demolished. However, the foundation went bankrupt before these plans were carried out.

On 20 September 1991, local residents and preservationists opened the disused building to the press and the public. A general sense of dismay, which also resounded in the city council, led to the appointment of a commission of experts, which proposed to have the building restored under the guidance of an architect with expert knowledge of medieval construction and foundation. {{ill|Walter Kramer (architect)|lt=Walter Kramer|nl|Walter Kramer}} was appointed to lead the restoration.

During restoration, the cellars (which had been filled in) were reopened, a wooden [[awning]] was added to the eastern facade. The paving around the building was changed so that de Waag again became the centre point on Nieuwmarkt square.

=== 21st century ===

Following the restoration, the building was rented out. Waag Society, a foundation that aims to foster experimentation with new technologies, art and culture, is housed on the upper floors. The ground floor is now a café and restaurant.

The building is slowly sinking due to the porous soil and the cement that was used for the restoration. In July 2009 it was falsely reported in the media that one of the towers was about to collapse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waag.org/news/57148 Waagtoren op instorten?], Waag Society, 10 July 2009 (Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the foundation will need to be improved or replaced in order to remedy the situation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parool.nl/parool/nl/4/AMSTERDAM/article/detail/1071043/2010/12/10/De-Waag-moet-snel-op-nieuwe-fundering.dhtml De Waag moet snel op nieuwe fundering], www.parool.nl, 10 December 2010 (Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2011, a frame was built around the tower to support it and prevent it from collapsing.&lt;ref name="AT5-2011"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.at5.nl/artikelen/57277/de-waag-scheurt-zichzelf-in-stukken |title = De Waag scheurt zichzelf in stukken |trans-title=De Waag is tearing itself to pieces |language = Dutch |work = [[AT5|AT5 Nieuws]] |location = [[Amsterdam]] |date = February 13, 2011 |accessdate = May 10, 2012 |quote = ''De fundering van De Waag op de Nieuwmarkt is zo slecht dat hij helemaal vervangen moet worden'' (The foundation of De Waag on the Nieuwmarkt is so bad that it must be completely replaced) }}&lt;/ref&gt;
