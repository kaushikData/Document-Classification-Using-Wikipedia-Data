{{main|Dutch literature}}
This article deals with '''[[literature]] written in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] during the 19th century''' in the Dutch-speaking regions ([[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[Dutch East Indies]]).

The last years of the 18th century, which had seen decline in the Republic, including the [[art]]s and [[international politics]], were marked by a general revival of intellectual force. The [[romanticism|romantic movement]] in [[Germany]] made itself deeply felt in all branches of Dutch literature and German [[lyricism]] took the place hitherto held by French [[classicism]], in spite of the country falling to French expansionalism (see also [[History of the Netherlands#Batavian revolution|History of the Netherlands]]).

==The French era and the United Kingdom of the Netherlands (1795–1839)==
[[Image:Bilderdijk.png|thumb|right|Willem Bilderdijk.]]Against this backdrop, the most prominent writer was '''[[Willem Bilderdijk]]''' (1756–1831), an intellectual and intelligent man whose outspoken and eccentric worldview was partly caused by an illness during his [[adolescence]] that kept him indoors for ten years. Once recovered he lived a busy, eventful life, writing great quantities of verse; in 1809 he started writing the work he designed to be his masterpiece, the [[epic poem|epic]] ''De Ondergang der Eerste Wereld'' ("The Destruction of the First World"), which remained unfinished and appeared as a fragment only in 1820.

Bilderdijk had no time for the new romantic style of poetry, but its fervour found its way into the Netherlands nevertheless, and first of all in the person of [[Hiëronymus van Alphen]] (1746–1803). Van Alphen is best remembered for the verses he wrote for children, which are still taught in [[kindergarten]]s all over the country. Van Alphen was an exponent of the more sentimental school along with [[Rhijnvis Feith]] (1753–1824), whose romances are steeped in [[Weltschmerz]].

In [[Hendrik Tollens]] (1780–1856) some the power of [[Willem Bilderdijk|Bilderdijk]] and the sweetness of [[Rhijnvis Feith|Feith]] were combined. He is best known for celebrating the great deeds of [[History of the Netherlands|Dutch history]] in a series of lyrical romances. Today, Tollens is best known for his poem "Wien Neêrlands Bloed" ("To Those in Whom Dutch Blood Flows Through the Veins"), a [[nationalism|nationalistic]] effort that, set to music, was the [[Dutch national anthem]] until 1932, when it was superseded by [[Philips van Marnix, lord of Sint-Aldegonde|Marnix']] "Wilhelmus". A poet of considerable talent, whose powers were awakened by personal intercourse with Tollens and his followers, was [[A.C.W. Staring|Antoni Christiaan Wijnandt Staring]] (1767–1840). Staring first published at the age of fifty-three only, but continued to write till past his seventieth year. His poems are a blend of romanticism and [[rationalism]].

During this period, the [[Low Countries]] had gone through major political upheaval. The [[Spanish Netherlands]] had first become the [[Austrian Netherlands]] before being [[annexation|annexed]] by France in 1794. The Republic, which had become a ''de facto'' [[monarchy]] in 1747 when the office of [[stadtholder]] became hereditary to the [[House of Orange-Nassau]], saw a revolution inspired and backed by France that led to the [[Batavian Republic]] and [[Kingdom of Holland]] [[vassal state]]s before actual French annexation in 1810. This transition period removed many old habits and institutions and provided for [[unitary state|unitary government]], the first [[constitution]] (1798) and uniform [[orthography]] ([[Matthias Siegenbeek]]'s spelling).

After [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]'s [[Battle of Waterloo|downfall]] in the [[Southern Netherlands]] village of [[Waterloo, Belgium|Waterloo]], the northern and southern provinces were briefly united as the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]]; this period lasted until 1830 only, when the southern provinces [[secession|seceded]] to form [[Belgium]]. This period had little influence in literature, and in the new state of Belgium, the status of the Dutch language remained largely unchanged as all governmental and educational affairs were conducted in French.

==Ministers, formalism and romanticism (1830–1880)==
[[Image:Nicolaas Beets.gif|thumb|right|Nicolaas Beets (Hildebrand).]]In scientific and religious literature men of letters showed themselves cognizant of the newest shades of opinion, and freely ventilated their ideas. The language resisted the pressure of German from the outside, and from within broke through its long stagnation and enriched itself, as a medium for literary expression, with a multitude of fresh and colloquial forms. At the same time, no very great genius arose in the [[Netherlands]] in any branch of literature. For the thirty or forty years preceding 1880 the course of literature in Holland was smooth and even sluggish. The Dutch writers had slipped into a conventionality of treatment and a strict limitation of form from which even the most striking talents among them could scarcely escape.

Poetry and a large part of prose was dominated by the so-called school of ministers, as the leading writers all were or had been [[Calvinist]] [[minister of religion|ministers]]. As a result, many of their products emphasized Biblical and [[bourgeois]] domestic values. Prime examples include [[Everhardus Johannes Potgieter]] (1808–1875, [[lyric poetry]]) and [[Nicolaas Beets]] (1814–1903), who wrote large quantities of sermons and poetry under his own name but is chiefly remembered today for the humorous prose sketches of Dutch life in ''Camera Obscura'' (1839), which he wrote during his student days under the [[pseudonym]] of '''[[Nicolaas Beets|Hildebrand]]'''.

A poet of power and promise was lost in the early death of [[Petrus Augustus de Genestet|P.A. de Genestet]] (1829–1861). His narrative poem "De Sint-Nicolaasavond" ("Eve of Saint Nicholas") appeared in 1849 and attained great popularity. Another poet who among others wrote verse for children was [[Jan Pieter Heije]] (1809–1876), whose songs are sung to this day. A poet who left no large contemporary impression but who is considered one of the very few readable 19th-century poets is [[Piet Paaltjens]] ([[pseudonym|ps.]] of François Haverschmidt, 1835–1894). Paaltjens personifies the pure Romantic vein exemplified in [[German literature]] by [[Heinrich Heine|Heine]] and others. Criticism was best represented by [[W. J. A. Jonckbloet]] (1817–1885), who was the first to write a comprehensive history of Dutch literature (1870).

[[Image:Hendrik Conscience.jpg|thumb|left|Hendrik Conscience.]]Under the influence of romantic nationalism, writers in [[Belgium]] began to reconsider their Flemish heritage and move for a recognition of the Dutch language in both official affairs (including education) and literature. [[Charles De Coster]] laid the foundations for a native Belgian literature by recounting the Flemish past in historic romances but wrote his works, including his masterpiece ''Légende de Thyl Ulenspiegel et de Lamme Goedzak'' (1867) in [[French language|French]]. '''[[Hendrik Conscience]]''' (1812–1883), himself the son of a Frenchman, was the first to write about [[Flanders|Flemish]] subjects in the Dutch language and so is considered the father of modern Flemish literature. In Flemish poetry, [[Guido Gezelle]] (1830–1899) is an important figure. Gezelle, an [[ordained]] [[journalist]]-cum-[[ethnology|ethnologist]], celebrated his faith and his Flemish roots using an archaic [[vocabulary]] based on [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] Flemish dialects to the detriment of his intelligibility beyond his native [[West Flanders]].

[[Image:Eduard Douwes Dekker - 001.jpg|thumb|right|E. Douwes Dekker (Multatuli).]]After the restoration in 1815 to the Dutch state of the [[Dutch East Indies]], former corporate [[Dutch East India Company]] possessions occupied by the [[United Kingdom]] during the [[Napoleonic era]], works of literature continued to be produced there, among which the romances of [[Melati van Java]] ([[pseudonym|ps.]] of Nicolina Maria Christina Sloot, 1853–1927), which were widely read in both the Netherlands and Belgium. With the rise of social consciousness regarding the administration of the colonies and the treatment of their inhabitants, however, a far more influential voice rose from the Indies in the form of '''[[Multatuli]]''' (ps. of Eduard Douwes Dekker, 1820–1887), whose ''[[Max Havelaar]]'' (1860) is a scathing indictment of colonial mismanagement and one of the few 19th-century prose works still widely considered readable today. Although the Belgians had obtained colonial possessions in their own right with the [[Congo Free State]]/[[Belgian Congo]], no Dutch-language literature was forthcoming as the territory was entirely Francophone.

The two leading [[Netherlands|Dutch]] men of letters in the mid-19th century besides Beets and Douwes Dekker were critics, [[Conrad Busken-Huet]] (1826–1886) and [[Carel Vosmaer]] (1826–1888). In Busken-Huet the principles of the 1830–1880 period were summed up; he had been during all those years the fearless and trusty watch-dog of Dutch letters as he understood them. He lived just long enough to become aware that a revolution was approaching, not to comprehend its character; but his accomplished fidelity to literary principle and his wide knowledge have been honoured even by the most bitter of the younger school.

==The Movement of 1880==
[[Image:Perk.jpg|thumb|left|Jacques Perk.]]In November 1881 '''[[Jacques Perk]]''' (born 1860) died, a young poet who had done no more than publish a few sonnets in a journal published by Vosmaer. He was no sooner dead, however, than his posthumous poems, and in particular a cycle of sonnets called "Mathilde", were published (1882) and awakened extraordinary emotion. Perk had rejected all the formulas of rhetorical poetry, and had broken up the conventional rhythms. There had been heard no music like his in Holland for two hundred years.

A group of young men collected around his name. They were joined by a poet-novelist-dramatist somewhat older than themselves, [[Marcellus Emants]] (1848–1923). Emants had written a symbolical poem called "Lilith" in 1879 that had been stigmatised as audacious and meaningless; encouraged by the admiration of his juniors, Emants published in 1881 a treatise in the form of a novel in which the first open attack was made on the old school.

The next appearance was that of [[Willem Kloos]] (1857–1938), who had been the editor and intimate friend of Perk, and who now undertook to lead the army of rebellion. His violent attacks on recognized authority in aesthetics began in 1882 and created a considerable scandal. For some time the new poets and critics found a great difficulty in being heard as all the channels of [[periodical literature]] were closed to them, but in 1884 the young school founded a review, ''De Nieuwe Gids'' ("The New Guide"), which was able to offer a direct challenge to ''De Gids'' ("The Guide"), the old guard's periodical. The new movement was called ''Tachtigers'' or "Movement of (Eighteen-)Eighty", after the decade in which it arose. The ''Tachtigers'' insisted that style must match content, and that intimate and visceral emotions can only be expressed using an intimate and visceral writing style.

In the same year 1884 a new element was introduced. Until now, the influences of the young Dutch poetry had chiefly come from the [[United Kingdom]]; they were those of [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]], [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning|Mrs Browning]], the Rossettis ([[Dante Gabriel Rossetti|Dante]] and [[Christina Rossetti|Christina]]). The [[France|French]] [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalists]] now became an additional ingredient and for some time the new Dutch literature became a sort of mixture of Shelley and [[Émile Zola|Zola]], heady and bewildering. This was the great flowering moment of the new school.

[[Image:Couperus.jpg|thumb|right|Louis Couperus.]]
One of the most important Dutch novelists, '''[[Louis Couperus]]''' (1863–1923), had his roots in the ''Tachtigers'' movement. His boyhood years were spent in [[Java (island)|Java]], and he had preserved in all his nature a certain [[tropics|tropical]] magnificence. His first literary efforts were lyrics in the ''Tachtigers'' style, but Couperus proved far more important and durable as a novelist and his earliest story, ''Eline Vere'' (1889) already took him out of the ranks of his contemporaries. In 1891 he published ''Noodlot'', which was translated into [[English language|English]] as "Footsteps of Fate" It was greatly admired by [[Oscar Wilde]], whose ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'' is said to have been influenced by it. Couperus continued to pour out one important novel after another until his death in 1923. He separated himself, as he developed, from the more fanatical members of the ''Tachtigers'' group, and addressed himself to the wider public. Another talent for prose was revealed by [[Frederik van Eeden]] (1860–1932) in ''De kleine Johannes'' ("Little Johnny", 1887) and in ''Van de koele meren des doods'' ("From the Cold Pools of Death", 1901), a melancholy novel.

==19th century==
After 1887 the condition of modern Dutch literature remained comparatively stationary, and within the last decade of the 19th century was definitely declining. In 1889 a new poet, [[Herman Gorter]] (1864–1927) made his appearance with an [[epic poem]] called ''Mei'' ("May"), eccentric both in prosody and in treatment. He held his own without any marked advance towards lucidity or variety. Since the recognition of Gorter, however, no really remarkable talent has made itself prominent in Dutch poetry except [[P.C. Boutens]] (1870–1943), whose ''Verzen'' ("Verses") in 1898 were received with great respect.

Willem Kloos, still the acute and somewhat turbulent leader of the school, collected his poems in 1894 and his critical essays in 1896. The others, with the exception of Couperus, showed symptoms of sinking into silence. The entire school, now that the struggle for recognition was over, and its members were accepted as the mainstream, rested on its triumphs and soon limited itself to a repetition of its old experiments.

The leading [[drama]]tist at the close of the century was [[Herman Heijermans]] (1864–1924), a writer of strong [[realism (art)|realistic]] and [[socialism|socialistic]] tendencies who single-handedly brought Dutch theatre into the modern time.  His ''Ghetto'' (1898) and ''Ora et labora'' (1901) particularly display his peculiar talent, while his [[fisherman|fishermen's]] [[tragedy]] ''Op hoop van zegen'' ("Trusting Our Fate in the Hands of God"), which is still staged and has been [[film]]ed more than once [https://www.imdb.com/find?q=op+hoop+van+zegen;s=tt], remains his most popular play.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4828">[[Image:Abraham Berliner.jpg|thumb|200px|Portrait of '''Abraham Berliner''', from the 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia.]]

'''Abraham (Adolf) Berliner''' (May 2, 1833 – April 21, 1915)  ([[Hebrew]]: אברהם ברלינר) was a German theologian and historian, born in [[Obersitzko]], in the [[Grand Duchy of Posen]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]]. He received his first education under his father, who was teacher in Obersitzko. He continued his education under various rabbis, preparing himself at the same time for the [[University of Leipzig]], where he received the degree of doctor of philosophy.

After serving for some time as preacher and teacher in [[Arnswalde]], Berliner was called (1865) to [[Berlin]] as superintendent of the religious school maintained by the society for [[Talmudic]] studies (Ḥebrat Shas), and in 1873, when [[Israel Hildesheimer]] opened the [[Hildesheimer Rabbinical Seminary|rabbinical seminary in Berlin]], Berliner was elected professor of Jewish history and literature. In this position, as well as in that of author, he has displayed an untiring activity. His edition of [[Rashi]]'s commentary to the [[Pentateuch]] (1866) first made him known as a scholar; he added to his reputation by various historical works, the result of his studies in the archives and libraries of [[Italy]], which country he frequently visited, subventioned by the [[Germany|German]] government.

Berliner edited for two years (1874–75) the scientific periodical ''Magazin für Jüdische Geschichte und Literatur,'' which from 1876 to 1893 he, together with his colleague, [[David Hoffmann]], continued under the title ''Magazin für die Wissenschaft des Judenthums.'' It was due to his zeal that the society [[Meḳiẓe Nirdamim]], for the publication of works of the older Jewish literature, which had been discontinued for several years, was revived in 1885 with Berliner as its director. He further acted as the apologist of Judaism in a pamphlet against [[Paul de Lagarde|Lagarde]] (''Prof. Paul de Lagarde, nach Seiner Natur Gezeichnet,'' 1887), who denounced all Jewish scholars as dilettanti; and when the blood accusation was revived, he republished (1888) the opinion of Cardinal Ganganelli—afterward [[Pope Clement XIV]]—to prove the falsity of this charge.

While orthodox in his religious views, Berliner was never a fanatic. He not only associated in his scientific work with the liberals, but also paid a high tribute to the merits of [[Moritz Steinschneider]] on the occasion of the latter's seventieth birthday (1886), by compiling a bibliography of that eminent scholar's works.

'''Abu al-Ghazi Bahadur''' ({{lang-uz|Abulgʻozi Bahodirxon}}, '''Abulgazi''', '''Ebulgazi''', '''Abu-l-Ghazi''', August 24, 1603 – 1663) was a [[Khan (title)|khan]] of the [[Khanate of Khiva]] from 1643 to 1663. He spent ten years in [[Persia]] before becoming khan, and was very well educated, writing two historical works in the Khiva dialect of the [[Chagatai language]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Vasily Bartold|Bartold, Vasily V]], ''Four Studies on the History of Central Asia'', '''1''' (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1956) p.65.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born in [[Konye-Urgench|Urgench]], [[Khanate of Khiva]], the son of ruler [['Arab Muhammad Khan]]. He fled to the [[Safavid]] court in [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]] after a power struggle arose among him and his brothers. He lived there in exile from 1629 until 1639 studying Persian and Arabic history. In 1644 or 1645 he acceded to the throne, a position he would hold for twenty years. He died in Khiva in 1663.

Abu al-Ghazi is known as the author of two historical works: "Genealogy of the Turkmen" ''[[Shajare-i Tarakime]]'' finished in 1661 and "Genealogy of the Turks" ''[[Shajare-i Türk]]'' finished in 1665. These are important sources for modern knowledge of Central Asian history.&lt;ref&gt;Sinor, Denis, ''Inner Asia: History, Civilization, Languages; A Syllabus'' (Bloomington: Indiana University, 1969) p.59.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Shajare-i Türk'' was Abu al-Ghazi's opus magnum, its title was variously translated as "Genealogy of the Turks" and "Genealogy of the Tatars", "shajare" being Turkic for "genealogy". According to Abu al-Ghazi, in ''Shajare-i Türk'' he used the work of [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani]], [[Sharaf ad-Din Ali Yazdi]], and other writers, totalling 18 historical sources, and corrected them in accordance with Turkic oral traditions which he was taught as a Prince.&lt;ref&gt;Abu al-Ghazi, ''"Genealogical History of Tatars"//Translation from French'', Russian Imperial Academy of Sciences, 1778, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; A manuscript of the ''Shajare-i Türk'' was purchased in Tobolsk from a Bukhara merchant by Swedish officers detained in Russian captivity in Siberia; using the local literate Tatars, the Swedish officers first translated the book into Russian, and then they retranslated it into various other languages. The French translation of the ''Shajare-i Türk'' was first published in Leiden in 1726, the French translation served as an original for a Russian translation published in 1768-1774, in 1780 it was published separately in German and English, and during the 18th century was widely read in Europe.

In the 19th and 20th centuries were published numerous critical translations of the ''Shajare-i Türk'', which serve as historical sources for modern scholars. The first critical translation, performed by professional scholars, was published in [[Kazan]] in 1825. The Turkish translation of the text published in Kazan was done by philologist Vefik Ahmed Pasha and initially published in 1864. The most influential Western publication was ''Historie des Mogols et des Tatares par Aboul-Ghazi Behadour Khan, publiee, traduite et annotee par le baron Desmaisons'', St.-Petersbourg 1871-1874.&lt;ref&gt;Kononov A.N., ''"Abu al-Ghazi. Genealogy of the Turkmen. Editorial Introduction"''//''Oriental Literature'' {{cite web|url=http://www.vostlit.info/Texts/rus6/Abulgazi/vved/frame.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524223216/http://www.vostlit.info/Texts/rus6/Abulgazi/vved/frame.html |archivedate=2011-05-24 |df= }} ''(in Russian)''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nikita Bichurin|N.Ya. Bichurin]] was the first to notice that the biography of the epic ancestor of the Turkic people Oguz-Kagan by Abu al-Ghazi and the Turco-Persian manuscripts ([[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani|Rashid al-Din]], [[Muhammad Khwandamir|Hondemir]], Abulgazi) has a striking similarity with the [[Maodun]] biography in the Chinese sources (feud between father and son and murder of the latter, the direction and sequence of conquests, etc.). That observation, confirmed by other scholars, associated in the scientific literature the name of Maodun with the epic personality of the Oguz-Kagan.&lt;ref&gt;Taskin V.S., Materials on the history of the Sünnu, transl., Moscow, Science, 1968, Vol. 1, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; The similarity is even more remarkable because at the time of the writing, no Chinese annals were translated into either oriental or western languages, and Abu al-Ghazi could not have known about Eastern Huns or Maodun.

The literary significance of ''Shajare-i Türk'' is that Abu al-Ghazi openly spoke against Chaghatay literary language because it carried a strong Persian influence. Abu al-Ghazi language is easy, simple folk language of the Khiva Uzbeks and is quite different from the Chaghatay literary language. The style of Abu al-Ghazi, despite a scientific nature of his compositions, is distinguished by clarity and richness of vocabulary, and is interspersed with the falk Uzbek expressions and proverbs.&lt;ref&gt;"Abu al-Ghazi"//''Literary Encyclopedia'' {{cite web|url=http://feb-web.ru/feb/litenc/encyclop/le1/le1-0152.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215222130/http://feb-web.ru/feb/litenc/encyclop/le1/le1-0152.htm |archivedate=2010-12-15 |df= }} ''(in Russian)''&lt;/ref&gt;

Abu al-Ghazi's son, [[Abu al-Muzaffar Anusha Muhammad Bahadur]], reassigned to complete the work of his father ''Shajare-i Türk'' to a certain Mahmud bin Mulla Muhammad Zaman Urgench. It was finalized in 1665. The work lists a Turkic genealogy starting from the biblical [[Adam]] and the primogenitor of the Turks, Oguz-Khan, and provides legendary details on their descendents including [[Chengiz Khan]] and the [[Shaybanid]] dynasty, providing a good picture of Mongol and Turkic historical understanding of the time.

The '''Aftermath of World War II''' was the beginning of an era defined by the decline of all [[European colonial empires]] and the simultaneous rise of two [[superpower]]s: the [[Soviet Union]] (USSR) and the [[United States]] (USA). [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] during [[World War II]], the USA and the USSR became competitors on the world stage and engaged in the [[Cold War]], so called because it never resulted in overt, declared hot war between the two powers but was instead characterized by [[espionage]], [[political subversion]] and [[proxy war]]s. [[Western Europe]] and [[Japan]] were rebuilt through the American [[Marshall Plan]] whereas [[Central and Eastern Europe]] fell under the [[Soviet sphere of influence]] and eventually behind an "[[Iron Curtain]]". Europe was divided into a US-led [[Western Bloc]] and a Soviet-led [[Eastern Bloc]]. Internationally, alliances with the two blocs gradually shifted, with some nations trying to stay out of the Cold War through the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. The Cold War also saw a [[nuclear arms race]] between the two superpowers; part of the reason that the Cold War never became a "hot" war was that the Soviet Union and the United States had nuclear deterrents against each other, leading to a [[mutually assured destruction]] standoff.

As a consequence of the war, the Allies created the [[United Nations]], an organization for international cooperation and diplomacy, similar to the [[League of Nations]]. Members of the United Nations agreed to outlaw [[War of aggression|wars of aggression]] in an attempt to avoid a [[World War III|third world war]]. The devastated great powers of Western Europe formed the [[European Coal and Steel Community]], which later evolved into the [[European Economic Community]] and ultimately into the current [[European Union]]. This effort primarily began as an attempt to avoid another war between [[Germany]] and [[France]] by economic cooperation and integration, and a common market for important natural resources. 

The end of the war also increased the rate of [[decolonization]] from the great powers with independence being granted to [[India]] (from the [[United Kingdom]]), [[Indonesia]] (from the [[Netherlands]]), [[the Philippines]] (from the [[US]]) and a number of [[Arab nations]], primarily from specific rights which had been granted to great powers from [[League of Nations Mandate]]s in the [[Aftermath of World War I|post World War I-era]] but often having existed ''[[de facto]]'' well before this time.  Independence for the nations of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] came more slowly.

The aftermath of World War II also saw the rise of communist influence in Southeast Asia, with the [[People's Republic of China]], as the [[Chinese Communist Party]] emerged [[Chinese Communist Revolution|victorious]] from the [[Chinese Civil War]] in 1949.

==Immediate effects==
[[File:Destroyed Warsaw, capital of Poland, January 1945.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Warsaw]], [[Poland]]: Aftermath of the war.]]
At the end of the war, millions of people were dead and millions more homeless, the European economy had collapsed, and much of the European industrial infrastructure had been destroyed. The [[Soviet Union]], too, had been heavily affected. In response, in 1947, [[U.S. Secretary of State]] [[George Marshall]] devised the "European Recovery Program", which became known as the [[Marshall Plan]]. Under the plan, during 1948–1952 the [[United States government]] allocated US$13 billion (US${{inflation|US|13|1947|r=0}} billion in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}} dollars) for the reconstruction of [[Western Europe]].

===United Kingdom===
By the end of the war, the economy of the [[United Kingdom]] was one of severe privation. More than a quarter of its national wealth had been consumed. Until the introduction in 1941 of [[Lend-Lease]] aid from the US, the UK had been spending its assets to purchase American equipment including aircraft and ships—over £437 million on aircraft alone. Lend-lease came just before its reserves were exhausted. Britain had placed 55% of its total labour force into war production.

In spring 1945, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] withdrew from the wartime coalition government, in an effort to oust [[Winston Churchill]], forcing a [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|general election]]. Following a landslide victory, Labour held more than 60% of the seats in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and formed a new government on 26 July 1945 under [[Clement Attlee]].

Britain's war debt was described by some in the American administration as a "millstone round the neck of the British economy". Although there were suggestions for an international conference to tackle the issue, in August 1945 the U.S. announced unexpectedly that the Lend-Lease programme was to end immediately.

The abrupt withdrawal of American Lend-Lease support to Britain on 2 September 1945 dealt a severe blow to the plans of the new government. It was only with the completion of the [[Anglo-American loan]] by the United States to Great Britain on 15 July 1946 that some measure of economic stability was restored. However, the loan was made primarily to support British overseas expenditure in the immediate post-war years and not to implement the Labour government's policies for domestic welfare reforms and the [[Nationalization|nationalisation]] of key industries. Although the loan was agreed on reasonable terms, its conditions included what proved to be damaging fiscal conditions for [[Pound sterling|Sterling]]. From 1946-1948, the UK introduced bread rationing which it never did during the war.&lt;ref&gt;''The Dominance of England'', Dorothy Crisp, Holborn Publishing, London 1960, pages 22-26,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The World at War'', Mark Arnold-Foster, BCA London, 1974, pages 286-7,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Times'' Sept 6, 2009 by Max Hastings&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A History of the American People'', Paul Johnson, Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, London, 1997, pages 647-8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviet Union===
[[File:Stalingrad aftermath.jpg|thumb|left|Ruins in Stalingrad, typical of the destruction in many Soviet cities.]]
The Soviet Union suffered enormous losses in the war against Germany. The Soviet population decreased by about 27
million during the war; of these, 8.7 million were combat deaths. The 19 million non-combat deaths had a variety of causes: starvation in the [[siege of Leningrad]]; conditions in German prisons and concentration camps; mass shootings of civilians; harsh labour in German industry; famine and disease; conditions in Soviet camps; and service in German or German-controlled military units fighting the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ellman and S. Maksudov, "Soviet Deaths in the Great Patriotic War: A Note", ''Europe-Asia Studies'', Vol. 46, No. 4, pp. 671-680&lt;/ref&gt; The population would not return to its pre-war level for 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;"20m Soviet war dead may be underestimate”, ''Guardian'', 30 April 1994 quoting Professor John Erickson of Edinburgh University, Defence Studies.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soviet ex-[[POW]]s and civilians repatriated from abroad were suspected of having been Nazi collaborators, and 226,127 of them were sent to forced labour camps after scrutiny by Soviet intelligence, [[NKVD]]. Many ex-POWs and young civilians were also conscripted to serve in the Red Army. Others worked in labour battalions to rebuild infrastructure destroyed during the war.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Bacon, "Glasnost and the Gulag: New Information on Soviet Forced Labour around World War II", ''Soviet Studies'', Vol. 44, No. 6 (1992), pp. 1069-1086.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ellman, "Soviet Repression Statistics: Some Comments”, ''Europe-Asia Studies'', Vol. 54, No. 7 (Nov., 2002), pp. 1151-1172&lt;/ref&gt;

The economy had been devastated. Roughly a quarter of the Soviet Union's capital resources were destroyed, and industrial and agricultural output in 1945 fell far short of pre-war levels. To help rebuild the country, the Soviet government obtained limited credits from Britain and Sweden; it refused assistance offered by the United States under the Marshall Plan. Instead, the Soviet Union coerced Soviet-occupied Central and Eastern Europe to supply machinery and raw materials. Germany and former Nazi satellites made reparations to the Soviet Union. The reconstruction programme emphasised heavy industry to the detriment of agriculture and consumer goods. By 1953, steel production was twice its 1940 level, but the production of many consumer goods and foodstuffs was lower than it had been in the late 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn E. Curtis, ed. [http://countrystudies.us/russia/12.htm Russia: A Country Study], Washington: Library of Congress, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

The immediate post-war period in Europe was dominated by the Soviet Union [[Eastern Bloc#Countries annexed as Soviet Socialist Republics|annexing]], or converting into [[Soviet Socialist Republics]],&lt;ref name="senn"&gt;Senn, Alfred Erich, ''Lithuania 1940 : revolution from above'', Amsterdam, New York, Rodopi, 2007 {{ISBN|978-90-420-2225-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Roberts|2006|p=43}}&lt;ref name="wettig20"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wettig|first=Gerhard|title=Stalin and the Cold War in Europe|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2008|isbn=0-7425-5542-9|pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; all the countries invaded and annexed by the [[Red Army]] driving the Germans out of central and eastern Europe. New [[satellite states]] were set up by the Soviets in [[People's Republic of Poland|Poland]], [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungary]],{{sfn|Granville|2004}}{{page needed|date=February 2018}} [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]],{{sfn|Grenville|2005|pp=370–371}} [[People's Republic of Romania|Romania]],{{sfn|Crampton|1997|pp=216–7}}{{Full citation needed|date=November 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;''Eastern bloc'', ''The American Heritage New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy'', Third Edition.

The Allies established the [[Far Eastern Commission]] and Allied Council for [[Japan]] to administer their occupation of that country while the establishment [[Allied Control Council]], administered occupied Germany. In accordance with the [[Potsdam Conference]] agreements, the Soviet Union occupied and subsequently annexed the strategic island of [[Sakhalin]].

[[East Germany]] was formed by the Soviet Zone, while West Germany was formed by the American, British, and French zones in 1949 and the Saar in 1957.]]

In the west, [[Alsace-Lorraine]] was returned to France. The [[Sudetenland]] reverted to Czechoslovakia following the [[European Advisory Commission]]'s decision to delimit German territory to be the territory it held on 31 December 1937. Close to one-quarter of pre-war (1937) Germany was ''de facto'' annexed by the Allies; roughly 10 million Germans were either expelled from this territory or not permitted to return to it if they had fled during the war. The remainder of Germany was partitioned into four zones of occupation, coordinated by the [[Allied Control Council]]. The [[Saar (protectorate)|Saar]] was detached and put in economic union with France in 1947. In 1949, the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] was created out of the Western zones. The Soviet zone became the [[German Democratic Republic]].

Germany paid [[German reparations for World War II|reparations]] to the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union, mainly in the form of [[Industrial plans for Germany|dismantled factories]], [[Forced labor of Germans after World War II|forced labour]], and coal. German [[standard of living]] was to be reduced to its 1932 level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,852764,00.html Cost of Defeat] Time Magazine Monday, 8 April 1946&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning immediately after the German surrender and continuing for the next two years, the US and Britain pursued an "intellectual reparations" programme to harvest all technological and scientific know-how as well as all patents in Germany. The value of these amounted to around US$10 billion{{sfn|Naimark|1995|p=206}} (US${{inflation|US|10|1946|r=0}} billion in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}} dollars). In accordance with the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947]], reparations were also assessed from the countries of [[Italy]], [[Romania]], [[Hungary]], [[Bulgaria]], and [[Finland]].

US policy in post-war Germany from April 1945 until July 1947 had been that no help should be given to the Germans in rebuilding their nation, save for the minimum required to mitigate starvation. The Allies' immediate post-war "industrial disarmament" plan for Germany had been to destroy Germany's capability to wage war by complete or partial de-industrialization. The first industrial plan for Germany, signed in 1946, required the destruction of 1,500 manufacturing plants to lower German heavy industry output to roughly 50% of its 1938 level. Dismantling of West German industry ended in 1951. By 1950, equipment had been removed from 706 [[manufacturing plants]], and steel production capacity had been reduced by 6.7 million tons.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick H. Gareau "Morgenthau's Plan for Industrial Disarmament in Germany" The Western Political Quarterly, Vol. 14, No. 2 (Jun., 1961), pp. 517-534&lt;/ref&gt; After lobbying by the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] and Generals [[Lucius D. Clay]] and [[George Marshall]], the [[Harry S. Truman|Truman administration]] accepted that economic recovery in Europe could not go forward without the [[Reconstruction of Germany|reconstruction of the German industrial base]] on which it had previously been dependent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usip.org/files/resources/pwks49.pdf Ray Salvatore Jennings "The Road Ahead: Lessons in Nation Building from Japan, Germany, and Afghanistan for Postwar Iraq] May 2003, Peaceworks No. 49  pg.15&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1947, President Truman rescinded on "national security grounds"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usip.org/files/resources/pwks49.pdf Ray Salvatore Jennings “The Road Ahead: Lessons in Nation Building from Japan, Germany, and Afghanistan for Postwar Iraq] May 2003, Peaceworks No. 49 p.15&lt;/ref&gt; the directive that had ordered the US occupation forces to "take no steps looking toward the economic rehabilitation of Germany." A new directive recognised that "[a]n orderly, prosperous Europe requires the economic contributions of a stable and productive Germany."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,887417,00.html Pas de Pagaille!] [[Time Magazine]] 28 July 1947.&lt;/ref&gt; From mid-1946 onwards Germany received US government aid through the [[GARIOA]] programme. From 1948 onwards West Germany also became a minor beneficiary of the Marshall Plan. Volunteer organisations had initially been forbidden to send food, but in early 1946 the [[Council of Relief Agencies Licensed to Operate in Germany]] was founded. The prohibition against sending [[CARE Package]]s to individuals in Germany was rescinded on 5 June 1946.

After the German surrender, the [[International Red Cross]] was prohibited from providing aid such as food or visiting POW camps for Germans inside Germany. However, after making approaches to the Allies in the autumn of 1945 it was allowed to investigate the camps in the UK and French occupation zones of Germany, as well as to provide relief to the prisoners held there. On 4 February 1946, the Red Cross was permitted to visit and assist prisoners also in the U.S. occupation zone of Germany, although only with very small quantities of food. The Red Cross petitioned successfully for improvements to be made in the living conditions of German POWs.&lt;ref&gt;Staff.

===Italy===
The 1947 [[Treaty of Peace with Italy, 1947|Treaty of Peace with Italy]] spelled the end of the [[Italian Empire|Italian colonial empire]], along with other border revisions. The 1947 [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris Peace Treaties]] compelled Italy to pay $360 million (US dollars at 1938 prices) in [[war reparations]]: $125 million to [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], $105 million to [[Greece]], $100 million to the [[Soviet Union]], $25 million to [[Ethiopia]] and $5 million to [[Albania]]. In the 1946 [[Italian constitutional referendum, 1946|Italian constitutional referendum]] the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italian monarchy]] was abolished, having been associated with the deprivations of the war and the [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] rule, especially in the [[Northern Italy|North]].

Unlike in Germany and Japan, no [[war crimes tribunal]]s were held against Italian military and political leaders, though the [[Italian resistance movement|Italian resistance]] [[Summary execution|summarily executed]] some of them (such as [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]]) at the end of the war; the [[Togliatti amnesty]], taking its name from the Communist Party secretary at the time, pardoned all wartime common and political crimes in 1946.

===Austria===
The [[Federal State of Austria]] had been annexed by Germany in 1938 ([[Anschluss]], this union was banned by the [[Treaty of Versailles]]). Austria (called [[Ostmark (Austria)|Ostmark]] by the Germans) was separated from Germany and divided into four zones of occupation. With the [[Austrian State Treaty]], these zones reunited in 1955 to become the [[Austria|Republic of Austria]].

===Japan===

After the war, the Allies rescinded Japanese pre-war annexations such as [[Manchuria]], and [[Korea]] became independent. The Philippines and [[Guam]] were returned to the United States. Burma, Malaya, and Singapore were returned to Britain and French Indo-China back to France. The Dutch East Indies was to be handed back to the Dutch but was resisted leading to the Indonesian war for independence. At the [[Yalta Conference]], [[President of the United States|US President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] had secretly traded the Japanese Kurils and south Sakhalin to the Soviet Union in return for Soviet entry in the war with Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Time Magazine, FOREIGN RELATIONS: Secret of the Kurils, Monday, 11 February 1946 [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,854099,00.html URL]&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union annexed the [[Kuril Islands]], provoking the [[Kuril Islands dispute]], which is ongoing, as Russia continues to occupy the islands.

Hundreds of thousands of Japanese were forced to relocate to the Japanese main islands. Okinawa became a main US staging point. The US covered large areas of it with military bases and continued to occupy it until 1972, years after the end of the occupation of the main islands. The bases still remain. To skirt the [[Geneva Convention]], the Allies classified many Japanese soldiers as [[Japanese Surrendered Personnel]] instead of POWs and used them as forced labour until 1947. The UK, France, and the Netherlands conscripted some Japanese troops to fight colonial resistances elsewhere in Asia. General [[Douglas MacArthur]] established the [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East]]. The Allies collected reparations from Japan.

To further remove Japan as a potential future military threat, the [[Far Eastern Commission]] decided to de-industrialise Japan, with the goal of reducing Japanese standard of living to what prevailed between 1930 and 1934.&lt;ref name="Frederick H 1961 pp. 531"&gt;Frederick H. Gareau "Morgenthau's Plan for Industrial Disarmament in Germany" The Western Political Quarterly, Vol. 14, No. 2 (Jun., 1961), pp. 531&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Note: A footnote in Gareau also states: "For a text of this decision, see Activities of the Far Eastern Commission. Report of the Secretary General, February 1946 to July 10, 1947, Appendix 30, p. 85.")&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, the de-industrialisation programme in Japan was implemented to a lesser degree than the one in Germany.&lt;ref name="Frederick H 1961 pp. 531" /&gt; Japan received emergency aid from [[GARIOA]], as did Germany. In early 1946, the [[Licensed Agencies for Relief in Asia]] were formed and permitted to supply Japanese with food and clothes. In April 1948 the Johnston Committee Report recommended that the economy of Japan should be reconstructed due to the high cost to US taxpayers of continuous emergency aid.

Survivors of the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], known as [[hibakusha]] (被爆者), were ostracized by Japanese society. Japan provided no special assistance to these people until 1952.&lt;ref&gt;“Japan and North America: First contacts to the Pacific War”, Ellis S. Krauss, Benjamin Nyblade, 2004, pg. 351&lt;/ref&gt; By the 65th anniversary of the bombings, total casualties from the initial attack and later deaths reached about 270,000 in Hiroshima&lt;ref name="Yomiuri Shimbun"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/T100806005143.htm|title=Yomiuri Shimbun}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 150,000 in Nagasaki.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/Japan+marks+anniversary+nuclear+attack+Nagasaki/3375055/story.html| title=Montreal Gazette| access-date=2010-11-14| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524171534/http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/Japan+marks+anniversary+nuclear+attack+Nagasaki/3375055/story.html| archive-date=2012-05-24| dead-url=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 230,000 hibakusha were still alive {{as of|2010|lc=y}},&lt;ref name="Yomiuri Shimbun"/&gt; and about 2,200 were suffering from radiation-caused illnesses {{as of|2007|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/ed20070815a2.html |title=Japan Times |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011123702/http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/ed20070815a2.html |archivedate=2007-10-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finland===
In the [[Winter War]] of 1939–1940, the Soviet Union invaded neutral [[Finland]] and annexed some of its territory. [[Continuation War|From 1941 until 1944]], Finland aligned itself with Nazi Germany in a failed effort to regain lost territories from the Soviets. Finland retained its independence following the war but remained subject to [[Finlandization|Soviet-imposed constraints]] in its domestic affairs.

===The Baltic states===
{{Main|Occupation and annexation of the Baltic states by the Soviet Union (1940)}}
In 1940 the Soviet Union invaded and annexed the neutral [[Baltic states]], [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], and [[Lithuania]]. In June 1941, the Soviet governments of the Baltic states carried out [[June deportation|mass deportations]] of "enemies of the people"; as a result, many treated the invading Nazis as liberators when they invaded only a week later.

The [[Atlantic Charter]] promised self-determination to peoples deprived of it during the war. The [[British Prime Minister]], [[Winston Churchill]], argued for a weaker interpretation of the Charter to permit the Soviet Union to continue to control the Baltic states.&lt;ref&gt;Roger S. Whitcomb, "The Cold War in retrospect: the formative years," p. 18 "Churchill suggested that the principles of the Atlantic Charter ought not be construed so as to deny Russia the frontier occupied when Germany attacked in 1941." [https://books.google.com/books?id=LLq4oruub3gC&amp;pg=PA18&amp; Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1944 the U.S. accepted Churchill's view that the Atlantic Charter did not apply to the Baltic states.&lt;ref&gt;Roger S. Whitcomb, "The Cold War in retrospect: the formative years," p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

With the return of Soviet troops at the end of the war, the [[Forest Brothers]] mounted a [[guerrilla war]]. This continued until the mid-1950s.

===The Philippines===
{{Main|Japanese occupation of the Philippines}}

An estimated one million military and civilian Filipinos were killed from all causes; of these 131,028 were listed as killed in seventy-two [[war crime]] events. According to a United States analysis released years after the war, U.S. casualties were 10,380 dead and 36,550 wounded; Japanese dead were 255,795.&lt;ref name="GRottman2002"&gt;{{cite book |title=World War 2 Pacific island guide |last=Rottman |first=Gordon L. |authorlink= |year=2002 |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] |location= |isbn=978-0-313-31395-0 |page=318 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ChyilRml0hcC&amp;lpg=PA318&amp;dq=Killed%20philippines%20world%20war%20II&amp;pg=PA318#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=9 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Population displacement===
{{Main|World War II evacuation and expulsion|Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–50)|Population transfer in the Soviet Union|Internment of Japanese Americans|Japanese Canadian internment}}
[[File:Vertreibung.jpg|thumb|Expulsion of Germans from the [[Sudetenland]]]]
As a result of the new borders drawn by the victorious nations, large populations suddenly found themselves in hostile territory. The Soviet Union took over areas formerly controlled by Germany, Finland, Poland, and Japan. Poland lost the [[Kresy]] region (about half of its pre-War territory) and received [[Historical Eastern Germany|most of Germany east]] of the [[Oder-Neisse line]], including the industrial regions of [[Silesia]]. The German state of the Saar was temporarily a protectorate of France but later returned to German administration. As set forth at Potsdam, approximately 12 million people were expelled from Germany, including seven million from Germany proper, and three million from the [[Sudetenland]].

During the war, the United States government interned approximately 110,000 [[Japanese American]]s and [[Japanese people|Japanese]] who lived along the Pacific coast of the United States in the wake of [[Imperial Japan]]'s [[attack on Pearl Harbor]].&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service. [http://www.nps.gov/manz/ Manzanar National Historic Site]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=howmany&gt;Various primary and secondary sources list counts between persons.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Japanese Canadian internment|Canada interned]] approximately 22,000 Japanese Canadians, 14,000 of whom were born in Canada. After the war, some internees chose to return to Japan, while most remained in North America.

====Poland====
The Soviet Union expelled at least 2 million Poles from east of the new border approximating the [[Curzon Line]]. This estimate is uncertain as both the Polish Communist government and the Soviet government did not keep track of the number of expelled. The number of Polish citizens inhabiting Polish borderlands ([[Kresy]] region) was about 13 million before [[World War II]] broke out according to official Polish statistics. Polish citizens killed in the war that originated from the Polish borderlands territory (killed by both German Nazi regime and the Soviet regime or expelled to distant parts of [[Siberia]]) were accounted as Russian, Ukrainian or Belarusian casualties of war in official Soviet historiography. This fact imposes additional difficulties in making the correct estimation of the number of Polish citizens forcibly transferred after the war.&lt;ref name="Davies"&gt;[[Norman Davies]], ''[[God's Playground]], a History of Poland'', Columbia University Press, 1982, {{ISBN|0231053525}}, [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0231053525&amp;id=DMoPXktGwiUC&amp;pg=RA1-PA558 p.558]&lt;/ref&gt; The border change also reversed the results of the 1919-1920 [[Polish-Soviet War]]. Former Polish cities such as [[Lviv|Lwów]] came under control of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]]. Additionally, the Soviet Union transferred more than two million people within their own borders; these included Germans, Finns, [[Crimean Tatars]], and [[Chechens]].

As Soviet troops marched across the Balkans, they committed rapes and robberies in [[Romania]], [[Hungary]], [[Czechoslovakia]]
and Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Naimark|1995|pp=70-71}} The population of Bulgaria was largely spared this treatment, due possibly to a sense of ethnic kinship or to the leadership of Marshal [[Fyodor Tolbukhin]].{{sfn|Naimark|1995|pp=70-71}} The population of Germany was treated significantly worse.{{sfn|Naimark|1995|p=71}} Rape and murder of German civilians was as bad as, and sometimes worse than, Nazi propaganda had anticipated.&lt;ref name="Robert G.

Rapes also occurred under other occupation forces, though the majority were committed by Soviet troops.&lt;ref name="Robert G. Moeller 1997, p.34"/&gt; [[French Moroccan]] troops matched the behaviour of Soviet troops when it came to rape, especially in the early occupations of [[Baden]] and [[Württemberg]].{{sfn|Naimark|1995|p=106}} In a letter to the editor of ''[[TIME]]'' published in September 1945, an [[American army]] [[sergeant]] wrote, "Our own Army and the British Army along with ours have done their share of looting and raping ...

German soldiers left many [[war children]] behind in nations such as France and Denmark, which were occupied for an extended period. After the war, the children and their mothers often suffered recriminations.

====In Japan====
{{Main|Rape during the occupation of Japan}}

In the first few weeks of the American military occupation of Japan, rape and other violent crime was widespread in naval ports like Yokohama and Yokosuka but declined shortly afterward. There were 1,336 reported rapes during the first 10 days of the occupation of Kanagawa prefecture.&lt;ref&gt;Molasky, Michael S; Rabson, Steve (2000), Southern Exposure: Modern Japanese Literature from Okinawa, University of Hawaii Press, p. 16,22,121 {{ISBN|978-0-8248-2300-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Toshiyuki Tanaka relates that in Yokohama, the capital of the prefecture, there were 119 known rapes in September 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Tanaka, Yuki; Tanaka, Toshiyuki (2003), Japan's Comfort Women: Sexual Slavery and Prostitution During World War II, Routledge, {{ISBN|0-203-30275-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2015}}

Historians Eiji Takemae and Robert Ricketts state that "When US paratroopers landed in Sapporo, an orgy of looting, sexual violence, and drunken brawling ensued. Gang rapes and other sex atrocities were not infrequent" and some of the rape victims committed suicide.&lt;ref name="Takemae p67"&gt;Takemae, Eiji; Robert Ricketts (2003). Inside GHQ: The Allied Occupation of Japan and Its Legacy. trans. Robert Ricketts, Sebastian Swann. Continuum International. p. 67. {{ISBN|978-0-82641-521-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert L. Eichelberger|General Robert L. Eichelberger]], the commander of the U.S. Eighth Army, recorded that in the one instance when the Japanese formed a self-help vigilante guard to protect women from off-duty GIs, the Eighth Army ordered armored vehicles in battle array into the streets and arrested the leaders, and the leaders received long prison terms.&lt;ref name="Takemae p67"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Svoboda, Terese. "U.S. Courts-Martial in Occupation Japan: Rape, Race, and Censorship". The Asia-Pacific Journal: Japan Focus. Retrieved 2013-05-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Takemae and Ricketts, members of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF) were also involved in rapes:

{{quote |A former prostitute recalled that as soon as Australian troops arrived in Kure in early 1946, they "dragged young women into their jeeps, took them to the mountain, and then raped them. I heard them screaming for help nearly every night'. Such behavior was commonplace, but news of criminal activity by Occupation forces was quickly suppressed.&lt;ref name="Takemae p67"/&gt;}}

Rape committed by U.S. soldiers occupying Okinawa was also a notable phenomenon. Okinawan historian Oshiro Masayasu (former director of the Okinawa Prefectural Historical Archives) writes:

{{quote |Soon after the U.S. marines landed, all the women of a village on [[Motobu Peninsula]] fell into the hands of American soldiers. At the time, there were only women, children and old people in the village, as all the young men had been mobilized for the war. Soon after landing, the marines "mopped up" the entire village, but found no signs of Japanese forces. Taking advantage of the situation, they started "hunting for women" in broad daylight and those who were hiding in the village or nearby air raid shelters were dragged out one after another.&lt;ref&gt;Tanaka, Yuki; Tanaka, Toshiyuki (2003), Japan's Comfort Women: Sexual Slavery and Prostitution During World War II, Routledge, p.111  {{ISBN|0-203-30275-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Toshiyuki Tanaka, 76 cases of rape or rape-murder were reported during the first five years of the American occupation of Okinawa. However, he claims this is probably not the true figure, as most cases were unreported.&lt;ref&gt;Tanaka, Yuki; Tanaka, Toshiyuki (2003), Japan's Comfort Women: Sexual Slavery and Prostitution During World War II, Routledge, p.112  {{ISBN|0-203-30275-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Brief Overview of Post-war Latin America ==
One of the largest changes post-war was the global shift in those nations of authority. European influence in the Americas, Africa, and Asia diminished significantly, and only some of them managed to hold onto their colonial outposts, such as; Great Britain, France, and [[Holland]]. While the United States was considered one of two of the largest military and political powers after World War II, they did not show interest in colonizing with the exception of [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[United States Virgin Islands|US Virgin Islands]].

However, they did not hesitate to enforce their military strength; if there were protests from local governments asking for higher wages and better working conditions from US firms that have bases in Latin America, Washington would step in and destabilize the current government in order to establish one that was more compliant to their desires.

The increased industrialization in Latin America led to a need for a more educated workforce who knew how to operate the new machinery. This led to a previously unprecedented number of people attending schools for higher education when previously citizens rarely completed [[Secondary school|secondary school.]] Large numbers of women went on to pursue higher education for the first time, and this gave more opportunity for women in professions and employment in general outside of the home.

Universities also grew, and this led to a more progressive and left-leaning institutional setting; a larger number of people going to higher education led to a larger amount of the population being aware of and willing to challenge inequalities in society and were preoccupied with [[social justice]] and improving the [[infrastructure]] and government bureaucracy so it would serve all instead of a select privileged few.
These progressions managed to bring to light that while the middle class population was increasing, prosperity was absent from poor areas, both urban and rural, and this led to subsistence living or crowding into makeshift settlements on the outskirts of cities and towns. Often, such as in the Rocinho ''[[favela]]'' near Rio de Janeiro’s [[South Zone (Rio de Janeiro)|South Zone]], these poor settlements were placed directly adjacent to more wealthy residences, which emphasizes even more clearly how disproportionate these two class groups were, and still are today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of Modern Latin America: 1800 To The Present, Second Edition|last=Meade|first=Teresa|publisher=Wiley|year=2016|isbn=978-1-118-77248-5|location=|pages=223-224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 March 1946, in his [[:s:Sinews of Peace|"Sinews of Peace" (Iron Curtain)]] speech at [[Westminster College, Missouri|Westminster College]] in [[Fulton, Missouri]], Winston Churchill said "a shadow" had fallen over Europe. He described Stalin as having dropped an "[[Iron Curtain]]" between East and West. Stalin responded by charging that co-existence between communist countries and the West was impossible.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Cave Brown, ''Dropshot: The United States Plan for War with the Soviet Union in 1957,'' New York: Dial Press, 1978, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-1948 the Soviet Union [[Berlin Blockade|imposed a blockade on the Western zone of occupation in Berlin]].

Due to the rising tension in Europe and concerns over further Soviet expansion, American planners came up with a contingency plan code-named ''[[Operation Dropshot]]'' in 1949. It considered possible nuclear and conventional war with the Soviet Union and its allies in order to counter a Soviet takeover of Western Europe, the Near East and parts of Eastern Asia that they anticipated would begin around 1957. In response, the US would saturate the Soviet Union with atomic and high-explosive bombs, and then invade and occupy the country.&lt;ref&gt;Cave Brown, op cit, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; In later years, to reduce military expenditures while countering Soviet conventional strength, President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] would adopt a strategy of [[massive retaliation]], relying on the threat of a US nuclear strike to prevent non-nuclear incursions by the Soviet Union in Europe and elsewhere. The approach entailed a major buildup of US nuclear forces and a corresponding reduction in America's non-nuclear ground and naval strength.&lt;ref&gt;John Lewis Gaddis, ''Strategies of Continment'', New York: Oxford University Press, pp.127-9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walter LaFeber, ''America, Russia and the Cold War 1945-1966'', New York: John Wiley, 1968, pp.123-200&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union viewed these developments as "atomic blackmail".&lt;ref&gt;Chernyak, op cit, p.359&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Greece]], [[Greek Civil War|civil war broke out]] in 1946 between Anglo-American-supported royalist forces and [[Democratic Army of Greece|communist-led forces]], with the royalist forces emerging as the victors.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher M Woodhouse, ''The Struggle for Greece 1941-1949'', London: Hart-Davis 1976, pp.3-34, 76-7&lt;/ref&gt; The US launched a massive programme of military and economic aid to Greece and to neighbouring [[Turkey]], arising from a fear that the Soviet Union stood on the verge of breaking through the NATO defence line to the oil-rich [[Middle East]]. On 12 March 1947, to gain [[United States Congress|Congressional]] support for the aid, President Truman described the aid as promoting [[democracy]] in defence of the "[[free world]]", a principle that became known as the [[Truman Doctrine]].&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence S Wittner, [http://hnn.us/articles/18719.html “How Presidents Use the Term ‘Democracy’ as a Marketing Tool”], Retrieved October 29, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The US sought to promote an economically strong and politically united Western Europe to counter the threat posed by the Soviet Union. This was done openly using tools such as the [[European Recovery Program]], which encouraged European economic integration. The [[International Authority for the Ruhr]], designed to keep German industry down and controlled, evolved into the [[European Coal and Steel Community]], a founding pillar of the [[European Union]]. The United States also worked covertly to promote European integration, for example using the [[American Committee on United Europe]] to funnel funds to European federalist movements. In order to ensure that Western Europe could withstand the Soviet military threat, the [[Western European Union]] was founded in 1948 and [[NATO]] in 1949. The first NATO Secretary General, [[Lord Ismay]], famously stated the organisation's goal was "to keep the Russians out, the Americans in, and the Germans down". However, without the manpower and industrial output of [[West Germany]] no conventional defence of Western Europe had any hope of succeeding. To remedy this, in 1950 the US sought to promote the [[European Defence Community]], which would have included a rearmed West Germany. The attempt was dashed when the [[French Parliament]] rejected it. On 9 May 1955, West Germany was instead admitted to NATO; the immediate result was the creation of the [[Warsaw Pact]] five days later.

The [[Cold War]] also saw the creation of propaganda and espionage organisations such as [[Radio Free Europe]], the [[Information Research Department]], the [[Gehlen Organization]], the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], the [[Special Activities Division]], and the [[Ministry for State Security (Soviet Union)|Ministry for State Security]].

===Asia===

{{Main|Decolonization of Asia|Wars of national liberation}}
In Asia, the surrender of Japanese forces was complicated by the split between East and West as well as by the movement toward national self-determination in European colonial territories.

====China====
{{Main|Chinese Civil War|Cross-Strait relations}}
[[File:Chiang Kai-shek in full uniform.jpeg|thumb|upright|Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]], leader of the Chinese nationalist Kuomintang|alt=A Chinese man in military uniform, smiling and looking towards the left. He holds a sword in his left hand and has a medal in shape of a sun on his chest.]]

As agreed at the [[Yalta Conference]], the Soviet Union went to war against Japan three months after the defeat of Germany. The Soviet forces [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|invaded Manchuria]]. This was the end of the [[Manchukuo]] puppet state and all [[Evacuation of Manchukuo|Japanese settlers were forced to leave China]]. The Soviet Union dismantled the industrial base in Manchuria built up by the Japanese in the preceding years. Manchuria also became a base for the [[Communist Party of China|Communist]] Chinese forces because of the Soviet presence.

After the war, the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) party (led by generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]]) and the Communist Chinese forces resumed their [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]], which had been temporarily suspended when they fought together against Japan. The fight against the Japanese occupiers had strengthened popular support among the Chinese for the Communist [[guerrilla]] forces while it weakened the KMT, who depleted their strength fighting a conventional war. Full-scale war between the opposing forces broke out in June 1946. Despite U.S. support to the Kuomintang, Communist forces were ultimately victorious and established the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) on the mainland. The KMT forces retreated to the island of [[Taiwan]] in 1949. Hostilities had largely ceased in 1950.

With the Communist victory in the civil war, the Soviet Union gave up its claim to military bases in China that it had been promised by the Western Allies during World War II. The defeat of the US-backed KMT led to a debate in the United States about who in the US government was responsible for this, the debate is commonly labeled "Who lost China?"

The outbreak of the [[Korean War]] diverted the attention of the PRC at the same time as it bolstered US support for Chiang Kai-shek, the two main factors that prevented the PRC from invading Taiwan. Intermittent military clashes occurred between the PRC and Taiwan from 1950-1979. Taiwan unilaterally declared the civil war over in 1991, but no formal peace treaty or truce exists and the PRC officially sees Taiwan as a breakaway province that rightfully belongs to it and has expressed its opposition to [[Taiwan independence|Taiwanese independence]]. Even so, tensions between the two states has decreased over time for example with the [[Chen-Chiang summit]]s (2008-2011).

[[Sino-American relations]] (between the PRC and the US) continued to be mostly hostile up until [[1972 Nixon visit to China|US president Nixon visited China]] in 1972. From this point, the relations between them have improved over time although some tension and rivalry remain even with the end of the [[Cold War]] and the PRC's distancing from the Communist ideology.

====Korea====
{{Main|Division of Korea}}
[[File:Korean war 1950-1953.gif|thumb|left|upright|Evolution of the border between the two Koreas, from the [[Conference of Yalta|Yalta]] Soviet-American 38th parallel division to the stalemate of 1953 that persists as of today]]

At the [[Yalta Conference]], the Allies agreed that an undivided post-war Korea would be placed under four-power multinational trusteeship. After Japan's surrender, this agreement was modified to a [[Division of Korea|joint Soviet-American occupation]] of Korea.&lt;ref name="Dennis Wainstock 1999, p.3"&gt;Dennis Wainstock, ''Truman, McArthur and the Korean War'', Greenwood, 1999, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement was that Korea would be divided and occupied by the Soviets from the north and the Americans from the south.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Wainstock, ''Truman, McArthur and the Korean War'', Greenwood, 1999, pp.3, 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Korea, formerly [[Korea under Japanese rule|under Japanese rule]], and which had been partially occupied by the Red Army following the Soviet Union's entry into the war against Japan, was divided at the 38th parallel on the orders of the [[US War Department]].&lt;ref name="Dennis Wainstock 1999, p.3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jon Halliday and Bruce Cumings, ''Korea: The unknown war'', London: Viking, 1988, pp. 10, 16,  {{ISBN|0-670-81903-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; A US military government in southern Korea was established in the capital city of [[Seoul]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward Grant Meade, American military government in Korea,: King's Crown Press 1951, p.78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Wigfall Green, ''The Epic of Korea'', Washington: Public Affairs Press, 1950, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; The American military commander, [[Lieutenant general|Lt. Gen.]] [[John R. Hodge]], enlisted many former Japanese administrative officials to serve in this government.&lt;ref&gt;Walter G Hermes, ''Truce Tent and Fighting Front'', Washington, D.C.: US Army Center of Military History, 1992, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; North of the military line, the Soviets administered the disarming and demobilisation of repatriated Korean nationalist guerrillas who had fought on the side of Chinese nationalists against the Japanese in Manchuria during World War II. Simultaneously, the Soviets enabled a build-up of heavy armaments to pro-communist forces in the north.&lt;ref&gt;James M Minnich, ''The North Korean People's Army: origins and current tactics,'' Naval Institute Press, 2005 pp.4-10&lt;/ref&gt; The military line became a political line in 1948, when separate republics emerged on both sides of the 38th parallel, each republic claiming to be the legitimate government of Korea. It culminated in the north invading the south, start of the [[Korean War]] two years later.

====Malaya====
{{Main|Malayan Emergency}}
Labour and civil unrest broke out in the [[British Malaya|British colony of Malaya]] in 1946. A state of emergency was declared by the colonial authorities in 1948 with the outbreak of acts of terrorism. The situation deteriorated into a full-scale anti-colonial insurgency, or Anti-British National Liberation War as the insurgents referred to it, led by the [[Malayan National Liberation Army]] (MNLA), the military wing of the [[Malayan Communist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Mohamed Amin and Malcolm Caldwell (eds.), ''The Making of a Neo Colony,'' London: Spokesman Books, 1977, footnote, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; The Malayan Emergency would endure for the next 12 years, ending in 1960. In 1967, communist leader [[Chin Peng]] reopened hostilities, culminating in a [[Communist insurgency in Malaysia (1968–89)|second emergency]] that lasted until 1989.

====French Indochina====
{{Main|First Indochina War}}
Events during World War II in the colony of [[French Indochina]] (consisting of the modern-day states of [[Vietnam]], [[Laos]] and [[Cambodia]]) set the stage for the [[First Indochina War]] which in turn led to the [[Vietnam War]].

During World War II, the Vichy French aligned colonial authorities cooperated with the Japanese invaders. The communist-controlled [[common front]] [[Viet Minh]] (supported by the Allies) was formed among the Vietnamese in the colony in 1941 to fight for the independence of Vietnam, against both the Japanese and prewar French powers. After the [[Vietnamese Famine of 1945]] support for the Viet Minh was bolstered as the front launched a rebellion, sacking rice warehouses and urging the Vietnamese to refuse to pay taxes. Because the French colonial authorities started to hold secret talks with the Free French, the Japanese interned them 9 March 1945. When Japan surrendered in August, this created a power vacuum, and the Viet Minh took power in the [[August Revolution]], declaring the independent [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]]. However, the Allies (including the Soviet Union) all agreed that the area belonged to the French. Nationalist Chinese forces moved in from the north and British from the south (as the French were unable to do so immediately themselves) and then handed power to the French, a process completed by March 1946. Attempts to integrate the Democratic Republic of Vietnam with French rule failed and the Viet Minh launched their rebellion against the French rule starting the First Indochina War that same year (the Viet Minh organized common fronts to fight the French in Laos and Cambodia).

The war [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu|ended]] in 1954 with French withdrawal and a partition of Vietnam that was intended to be temporary until elections could be held. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam held the north while [[South Vietnam]] formed into a separate republic in control of [[Ngo Dinh Diem]] who was backed in his refusal to hold elections by the US. The communist party of the south eventually organized the common front [[Viet Cong|NLF]] to fight to unite south and north under the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and thus began the [[Vietnam War]], which ended with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam [[Fall of Saigon|conquering the South]] in 1975.

====Dutch East Indies====
{{Main|Indonesian National Revolution}}
[[File:IWM-SE-5742-tank-Surabaya-194511.jpg|thumb|right|A soldier of an Indian armoured regiment examines a light tank used by Indonesian nationalists and captured by British forces during the fighting in [[Surabaya]].]]
Japan [[Dutch East Indies campaign|invaded]] and [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|occupied]] [[Indonesia]] during the war and replaced much of the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] colonial state. Although the top positions were held by Japanese, the internment of all Dutch citizens meant that Indonesians filled many leadership and administrative positions. Following the Japanese surrender in August 1945, nationalist leaders [[Sukarno]] and [[Mohammad Hatta]] declared Indonesian independence. A four and a half-year struggle followed as the Dutch tried to re-establish their colony, using a significant portion of their Marshall Plan aid to this end.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WDgBBzWQ2DAC&amp;pg=PA403&amp;dq=Netherlands+Marhsall+plan+aid+indonesia&amp;sig=sQ3KNTs6jfaa_ceWBW9B_9DO-6Q |title=Nationalism and revolution in Indonesia&amp;nbsp;— Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-18 | isbn=978-0-87727-734-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Dutch were directly helped by UK forces who sought to re-establish the colonial dominions in Asia. The UK also kept 35,000 [[Japanese Surrendered Personnel]] under arms to fight the Indonesians.

Although Dutch forces re-occupied most of Indonesia's territory, a [[Guerrillas|guerrilla]] struggle ensued, and the majority of Indonesians, and ultimately international opinion, favoured Indonesian independence. In December 1949, the Netherlands formally recognised Indonesian sovereignty.

===Covert operations and espionage===
[[File:Yalta Conference (Churchill, Roosevelt, Stalin) (B&amp;W).jpg|thumb|left|The "[[Allies of World War II|Big Three]]" at the [[Yalta Conference]]: [[Winston Churchill]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and [[Joseph Stalin]]. Diplomatic relations between their three countries changed radically in the aftermath of World War II.]]
British covert operations in the Baltic States, which began in 1944 against the Nazis, escalated after the war. In [[Operation Jungle]], the [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (known as MI6) recruited and trained Estonians, Latvians, and Lithuanians for the clandestine work in the Baltic states between 1948 and 1955. Leaders of the operation included [[Alfons Rebane]], Stasys Žymantas, and Rūdolfs Silarājs. The agents were transported under the cover of the "British Baltic Fishery Protection Service". They launched from British-occupied Germany, using a converted World War II [[E-boat]] captained and crewed by former members of the [[Kriegsmarine|wartime German navy]].&lt;ref&gt;Sigured Hess, "The British Baltic Fishery Protection Service (BBFPS) and the Clandestine Operations of Hans Helmut Klose 1949-1956."

[[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] and the [[Middle East]] would later damage the reputation gained by the US during its successes in Europe.&lt;ref name="A Story Still to Be Told"/&gt;

The KGB believed that the [[Third World]] rather than Europe was the arena in which it could win the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Andrew &amp; Vasili Mitrokhin, ''The World was Going Our Way: The KGB and the Battle for the Third World'', New York: Basic Books, 2005, foreword, p. xxvi&lt;/ref&gt; Moscow would in later years fuel an arms buildup in [[Africa]]. In later years, African countries used as proxies in the Cold War would often become "failed states" of their own.&lt;ref name="A Story Still to Be Told"&gt;Judt, [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2006/mar/23/a-story-still-to-be-told/?page=3 "A Story Still to Be Told"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recruitment of former enemy scientists===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 141-1880, Peenemünde, Start einer V2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|V-2 rocket launching at [[Peenemünde]], on the Baltic German coast (1943).]]
When the divisions of postwar Europe began to emerge, the war crimes programmes and denazification policies of Britain and the United States were relaxed in favour of recruiting German scientists, especially nuclear and long-range rocket scientists.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Bower, The ''Paperclip Conspiracy: Battle for the spoils and secrets of Nazi Germany,'' London: Michael Joseph, 1987, pp.75-8, {{ISBN|0-7181-2744-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these, prior to their capture, had worked on developing the German V-2 long-range rocket at the Baltic coast German Army Research Center [[Peenemünde]]. Western Allied occupation force officers in Germany were ordered to refuse to cooperate with the Soviets in sharing captured wartime secret weapons,&lt;ref&gt;Bower, op cit, pp.95-6&lt;/ref&gt; the recovery for which, specifically in regards to advanced German aviation technology and personnel, the British had sent the [[Fedden Mission]] into Germany to contact its aviation technology centers and key personnel, paralleled by the United States with its own [[Operation Lusty]] aviation technology personnel and knowledge recovery program.

In [[Operation Paperclip]], beginning in 1945, the United States imported 1,600 German scientists and technicians, as part of the intellectual reparations owed to the US and the UK, including about $10 billion (US${{inflation|US|10|1946|r=0}} billion in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}} dollars) in patents and industrial processes.&lt;ref&gt;Naimark, ''Science Technology and Reparations: Exploitation and Plunder in Postwar Germany'' p.60&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1945, three German rocket-scientist groups arrived in the U.S. for duty at [[Fort Bliss, Texas]], and at [[White Sands Proving Grounds]], [[New Mexico]], as “War Department Special Employees”.&lt;ref name=Huzel&gt;{{cite book |last=Huzel|first=Dieter K|title=Peenemünde to Canaveral|year=1960|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs NJ|pages=27,226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviets began [[Operation Osoaviakhim]] in 1946. [[NKVD]] and Soviet army units effectively deported thousands of military-related technical specialists from the [[Soviet occupation zone]] of post-war Germany to the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Naimark|1995|p=220}} The Soviets used 92 trains to transport the specialists and their families, an estimated 10,000-15,000 people.{{sfn|Naimark|1995|p=227}} Much related equipment was also moved, the aim being to virtually transplant research and production centres, such as the relocated [[V-2 rocket]] centre at [[Mittelwerk]] [[Nordhausen]], from Germany to the Soviet Union. Among the people moved were [[Helmut Gröttrup]] and about two hundred scientists and technicians from [[Mittelwerk]].{{sfn|Naimark|1995|p=221}} Personnel were also taken from [[AEG]], [[BMW]]'s Stassfurt jet propulsion group, [[IG Farben]]'s Leuna chemical works, [[Junkers]], [[Schott AG]], [[Siebel]], [[Telefunken]], and [[Carl Zeiss AG]].{{sfn|Naimark|1995|p=222}}

The operation was commanded by NKVD deputy [[Ivan Serov|Colonel General Serov]],{{sfn|Naimark|1995|p=227}} outside the control of the local [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany|Soviet Military Administration]].{{sfn|Naimark|1995|p=223}} The major reason for the operation was the Soviet fear of being condemned for noncompliance with [[Allied Control Council]] agreements on the liquidation of German military installations.{{sfn|Naimark|1995|p=25}} Some Western observers thought Operation Osoaviakhim was a retaliation for the failure of the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party]] in elections, though Osoaviakhim was clearly planned before that.{{sfn|Naimark|1995|p=225}}

==Demise of the League of Nations and the founding of the United Nations==
As a general consequence of the war and in an effort to maintain international peace,&lt;ref&gt;Yoder, Amos. ''The Evolution of the United Nations System'', p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; the Allies formed the [[United Nations]] (UN), which officially came into existence on 24 October 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/aboutun/history.htm History of the UN] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218221016/http://www.un.org/aboutun/history.htm |date=2010-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN replaced the defunct [[League of Nations]] (LN) as an intergovernmental organization. The LN was formally dissolved on 20 April 1946 but had in practice ceased to function in 1939, being unable to stop the outbreak of World War II. The UN inherited some of the bodies of the LN, such as the [[International Labour Organization]].

[[League of Nations mandates]], mostly territories that had changed hands in [[World War I]], became [[United Nations Trust Territories]]. [[South-West Africa]], an exception, was still governed under terms of the original mandate. As the successor body to the League, the UN still assumed a supervisory role over the territory. The [[Free City of Danzig]], a semi-autonomous [[city state]] that was partly overseen by the League, became part of [[Poland]].

The UN adopted The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in 1948, "as a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations." The Soviet Union abstained from voting on adoption of the declaration. The US did not [[ratify]] the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|social and economic rights]] sections.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite web |url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/escr/files/escr_qa.pdf |format=PDF |title=Economic, Social and Cultural Rights: Questions and Answers |accessdate=2008-06-02 |publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |pages=6 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626045117/http://www.amnestyusa.org/escr/files/escr_qa.pdf |archivedate=26 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The five major Allied powers were given permanent membership in the [[United Nations Security Council]]. The permanent members can [[veto]] any [[United Nations Security Council resolution]], the only UN decisions that are binding according to [[international law]]. The five powers at the time of founding were: the United States of America, the United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union and the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]]. The Republic of China lost the [[Chinese Civil War]] and retreated to the island of Taiwan by 1950 but continued to be a permanent member of the Council even though the ''[[de facto]]'' state in control of mainland China was the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC). This was changed in 1971 when the PRC was given the permanent membership previously held by the [[Republic of China]]. Russia inherited the permanent membership of the Soviet Union in 1991 after the dissolution of that state.

==Unresolved conflicts==
[[Japanese holdout]]s persisted on various islands in the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theatre]] until at least 1974. Although all hostilities are now resolved, a peace treaty has never been signed [[Japan–Russia relations|between Japan and Russia]] due to the [[Kuril Islands dispute]].

The Soviet Union also experienced a rapid increase in production in the immediate post-war era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Smith|first=Alan|title=Russia And the World Economy: Problems of Integration|publisher=Routledge|year=1993|isbn=0-415-08924-7|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan experienced [[Japanese post-war economic miracle|rapid]] economic growth, becoming one of the most powerful economies in the world by the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Harrop|first=Martin|title=Power and Policy in Liberal Democracies|page=49|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1992|isbn=0-521-34579-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; China, following the conclusion of its civil war, was essentially bankrupt. By 1953, economic restoration seemed fairly successful as production had resumed pre-war levels.&lt;ref name="lonely planet"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Harper|first=Damian|title=China|publisher=Lonely Planet|year=2007|isbn=1-74059-915-2|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Note that this is a travel guide, not a historical work--&gt; This growth rate mostly persisted, though it was interrupted by economic experiments during the disastrous [[Great Leap Forward]].

At the end of the war, the United States produced roughly half of the world's industrial output. The US, of course, had been spared industrial and civilian devastation. Further, much of its pre-war industry had been converted to wartime usage. As a result, with its industrial and civilian base in much better shape than most of the world, the US embarked on an economic expansion unseen in human history. US [[Gross Domestic Product]] increased from $228 billion in 1945 to just under $1.7 trillion in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kunkel|first=John|title=America's Trade Policy Towards Japan: Demanding Results|publisher=Routledge|year=2003|isbn=0-415-29832-6|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=CountryEconomy.com|first=|title=United States: GDP|url=http://countryeconomy.com/gdp/usa?|accessdate=July 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Albert Muchar.jpg|right|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Albert Anton von Muchar]]
'''Albert Anton von Muchar''' was a historian, born in [[Lienz]], [[county of Tyrol|Tyrol]], 22 November, around 1781; died in [[Graz]], [[Styria]], 6 June 1849. He was descended from the noble and ancient family of the Muchars of Bied and Rangfeld, studied at the lyceum in Graz, entered the [[Benedictine Order]], and made his vows on 16 October 1808, at [[Admont]]. Ordained a priest shortly afterwards, he devoted himself entirely to the study of Middle Eastern languages, became librarian and keeper of the archives in 1813, and later on professor of Greek and Middle Eastern languages at the theological school of his monastery. From 1823 to 1825 he was supplementary professor of Biblical science, becoming afterwards professor of aesthetics and classical [[philology]] at the [[University of Graz]].

He found that pure philological studies did not suit his taste, and in this branch we possess from him only an edition of [[Horace]] with German translation, which appeared in 1835 at Graz. His researches dealt chiefly with the history of Austria, for which purpose he made extensive visits to the libraries of Austria, [[Bavaria]], and Upper Italy; thus, nearly all his historical works are based upon careful examination of the original sources. In 1829 the Academy of Sciences in Vienna elected him a member in recognition of his important contributions to national history, and he was one of the founders of the Historical Society for [[Inner Austria]].

==Published works==
*''Das römische Norikum'' (2 vols., Graz, 1825-6); 
*''Geschichte des Herzogtums Steiermark'' (History of the Duchy of Styria; Graz, 1845–74) in nine volumes, of which the first four were edited by himself, the following two by his colleagues, Prangner and von Gräfenstein, and the last three by the Historical Society of Styria. 
*Numerous essays for historical periodicals, e. g. [[Joseph Hormayr Freiherr zu Hortenburg|Hormayr]]'s "Archiv", the ''Steiermarkische Zeitschrift'', and the ''Archiv für Kunde österreichischer Geschichtsquellen'' (in which he published his ''Urkundenregesten für die Geschichte Innerösterreichs vom Jahre 1312-1500'' (Vienna, 1849)). 
*The library of Admont possesses in manuscripts some still more extensive works.

'''Archaeological ethics''' refers to the [[moral]] issues raised through the study of the material past. It is a branch of the [[Philosophy of archaeology]].

In common with other academic disciplines, archaeologists are bound to conduct their investigations to a high standard and observe intellectual property laws, [[Health and Safety]] regulations and other legal obligations. Professional bodies in the field require that their members work towards the preservation and management of archaeological resources, treat human remains with dignity and also usually encourage [[outreach]] activities. Where these bodies exist, sanctions are in place for those professionals who do not observe these ethical codes. By no means all jurisdictions have such professional bodies however and even where they do exist, membership may not be necessary in order to carry out archaeological investigations. While such considerations are fundamental to a pursuit, they are unfortunately coming rather late to the field. Questions regarding ethics have only arisen since the UNESCO accords in the 1970s began to protect world culture.

A common ethical issue in [[modern archaeology]] has been the treatment of human remains found during [[excavation (archaeology)|excavation]]s, especially those that represent the ancestors of [[indigenous peoples|aboriginal]] groups in the [[New World]] or the remains of other minority races elsewhere. Where previously sites of great significance to native peoples could be excavated and any burials and [[artifact (archaeology)|artefacts]] taken to be stored in museums or sold, there is increasing awareness in the West of taking a more respectful approach. The [[NAGPRA]] legislation in the [[United States of America]] is an example of this. The issue is not limited to ancient remains; nineteenth- and twentieth-century burial sites investigated by archaeologists such as [[First World War]] graves and cemeteries disturbed by developments have seen the remains of people with closely connected living relatives being exhumed and taken away.

The international trade in [[antiquities]], although not formally connected with the modern discipline of archaeology has also raised ethical questions regarding the ownership of archaeological artefacts. The market for imported antiquities has encouraged damage to [[archaeological site]]s and often led to appeals for the recall.

Examples of archaeological material removed from its place of origin and controversy over its return include the [[Elgin Marbles]].

A wider question of control and ownership over the past has also been raised through the political manipulation of the [[archaeological record]] to promote [[nationalism]] and justify military invasion. A famous example is the corps of archaeologists employed by [[Adolf Hitler]] to excavate in central Europe in the hope of finding evidence for a region-wide [[Aryan]] culture. Many archaeologists in the West today are employees of national governments or are privately employed instruments of government-derived archaeology legislation. In all cases this legislation is a compromise to some degree or another between the interests of the archaeological remains and the interests of economic development. Questions regarding the ethical validity of government heritage policies and whether they sufficiently protect important remains are raised during cases such as [[High Speed 1]] in [[London]] where burials at a cemetery at [[St Pancras railway station]] were hurriedly dug using a [[J. C. Bamford|JCB]] and mistreated in order to keep an important infrastructure project on schedule.

Another issue is the question of whether unthreatened archaeological remains should be excavated (and therefore destroyed) or preserved intact for future generations to investigate, perhaps using more advanced techniques that could provide more detailed information. Some archaeological guidance such as [[PPG 16]] has established a strong ethical argument for only excavating sites threatened with destruction.

Problem Areas in Archaeological Ethics
* Human Remains
* Responsibility of the Archaeologist vis-a-vis local traditions and cultures
* Responsibility of the Archaeologist vis-a-vis the architectural remains that have been uncovered during an excavation
* Responsibility of the Archaeologist vis-a-vis dissemination of the material uncovered, not only in academic circles but also to a broader public, both in the area of the excavation and from where the Sponsors come
* Balancing World, National and regional claims to various parts of the archaeological record
* protecting Archaeological sites and objects from illegal trade

[[File:LYablonskyFilipovkaKurganR1.jpg|thumb|260px| An archaeological site with human presence dating from 4th century BC, Fillipovka, South Urals, [[Russian Federation|Russia]]. This site has been interpreted as a [[Sarmatian]] [[Kurgan]].]]
An '''archaeological site''' is a place (or group of physical sites) in which evidence of past activity is preserved (either [[prehistoric]] or [[recorded history|historic]] or contemporary), and which has been, or may be, investigated using the discipline of [[archaeology]] and represents a part of the [[archaeological record]]. Sites may range from those with few or no remains visible above ground, to buildings and other structures still in use.

Beyond this, the definition and geographical extent of a "site" can vary widely, depending on the period studied and the theoretical approach of the archaeologist.

== Geographical extent ==
It is almost invariably difficult to delimit a site. It is sometimes taken to indicate a settlement of some sort although the archaeologist must also define the limits of human activity around the settlement.  Any episode of deposition such as a [[hoard]] or [[burial]] can form a site as well. Development-led archaeology undertaken as [[cultural resources management]] has the disadvantage (or the benefit) of having its sites defined by the limits of the intended development. Even in this case however, in describing and interpreting the site, the archaeologist will have to look outside the boundaries of the building site.

According to Jess Beck in "How Do Archaeologists find sites?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://bonebrokeblog.wordpress.com/2015/02/27/how-do-archaeologists-find-sites/|title = How do archaeologists find sites?|last = JB|website = Bone Broke|access-date = 2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; the areas with a large number of artifacts are good targets for future excavation, while areas with small number of artifacts are thought to reflect a lack of past human activity.” Many areas have been discovered by accident. The most common person to have found artifacts are farmers who are plowing their fields or just cleaning them up often find archaeological artifacts. Many people who are out hiking and even pilots find artifacts they usually end up reporting them to archaeologist to do further investigation. When they find sites, they have to first record the area and if they have the money and time for the site they can start digging. 

== Field survey ==
There are many ways to find sites, one example can be through surveys. Surveys involve walking around analyzing the land looking for artifacts.  It can also involve digging, according to the Archaeological Institute of America,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.archaeological.org/education/askexpertsfaq|title = Ask the Experts: AIA Archaeology FAQ - Archaeological Institute of America|website = www.archaeological.org|access-date = 2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; “archaeologists actively search areas that were likely to support human populations, or in places where old documents and records indicate people once lived.” This helps archaeologists in the future. In case there was no time, or money during the finding of the site, archaeologists can come back and visit the site for further digging to find out the extent of the site. Archaeologist can also sample randomly within a given area of land as another form of conducting surveys. Surveys are very useful, according to Jess Beck, “it can tell you where people were living at different points in the past.” Geophysics is a branch of survey becoming more and more popular in archaeology, because it uses different types of instruments to investigate features below the ground surface. It is not as reliable, because although they can see what is under the surface of the ground it does not produce the best picture. Archaeologists have to still dig up the area in order to uncover the truth. There are also two most common types of geophysical survey, which is, magnetometer and ground penetrating radar. Magnetometry&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.pastperfect.org.uk/archaeology/magneto.html|title = Learning Archaeology: Pre-Ex: Geophysics: Magnetometry|website = www.pastperfect.org.uk|access-date = 2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the technique of measuring and mapping patterns of magnetism in the soil. It uses an instrument called a magnetometer which is required to measure and map traces of soil magnetism. The ground penetrating radar&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.geophysical.com/whatisgpr.htm|title = What is GPR: A Brief Description by GSSI|website = www.geophysical.com|access-date = 2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a method that uses radar pulses to image the subsurface. It uses electro magnetic radiation in the microwave band of the radio spectrum, and detects the reflected signals from subsurface structures. 

There are many other tools that can be used to find artifacts, but along with finding artifacts, archaeologist have to make maps. They do so by taking data from surveys, or archival research and plugging it into a Geographical Information Systems (GIS)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.esri.com/what-is-gis|title = What is GIS|website = www.esri.com|access-date = 2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that will contain both locational information and a combination of various information. This tool is very helpful to archaeologists who want to explore in a different area and want to see if anyone else has done research. They can use this tool to see what has already been discovered. With this information available, archaeologists can expand their research and add more to what has already been found.

Traditionally, sites are distinguished by the presence of both [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s and [[Feature (archaeology)|feature]]s. Common features include the remains of hearths and houses.  [[Ecofact]]s, biological materials (such as bones, scales, and even feces) that are the result of human activity but are not deliberately modified, are also common at many archaeological sites. In the cases of the [[Palaeolithic]] and [[Mesolithic]] eras, a mere scatter of flint [[Lithic flake|flake]]s will also constitute a site worthy of study. Different archaeologists may see an ancient town, and its nearby cemetery as being two different sites, or as being part of the same wider site. The precepts of [[landscape archaeology]] attempt to see each discrete unit of human activity in the context of the wider environment, further distorting the concept of the site as a demarcated area. Furthermore, [[geoarchaeology|geoarchaeologists]] or [[environmental archaeology|environmental archaeologists]] would also consider a sequence of natural geological or organic deposition, in the absence of human activity, to constitute a site worthy of study.

Archaeological sites usually form through human-related processes but can be subject to natural, post-depositional factors. Cultural remnants which have been buried by sediments are in many environments more likely to be preserved than exposed cultural remnants.  Natural actions resulting in sediment being deposited include [[alluvial]] (water-related) or [[Aeolian processes|aeolian]] (wind-related) natural processes.  In [[jungle]]s and other areas of lush plant growth, decomposed vegetative sediment can result in layers of soil deposited over remains. [[Colluviation]], the burial of a site by sediments moved by gravity (called [[hillwash]]) can also happen at sites on slopes. Human activities (both deliberate and incidental) also often bury sites.  It is common in many cultures for newer structures to be built atop the remains of older ones. [[Urban archaeology]] has developed especially to deal with these sorts of site.

Many sites are the subject of ongoing excavation or investigation. Note the difference between archaeological sites and archaeological discoveries.

It is the capital and largest city of [[Catalonia]], as well as the second most populous municipality of Spain. With a population of 1.6 million within city limits,&lt;ref name="ine.es" /&gt; its [[urban area]] extends to numerous neighbouring municipalities within the [[Province of Barcelona]] and is home to around 4.8 million people,&lt;ref name="demographia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boeing2016"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://geoffboeing.com/publications/honolulu-rail-transit-barcelona/|author=Boeing, G.|title=Honolulu Rail Transit: International Lessons in Linking Form, Design, and Transportation|journal=Planext|date=2016|volume=2|pages=28–47|accessdate=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the [[list of urban areas in the European Union|sixth most populous urban area]] in the [[European Union]] after [[Paris]], [[London]], [[Madrid]], the [[Ruhr|Ruhr area]] and [[Milan]].&lt;ref name="demographia"/&gt; It is one of the largest metropolises on the [[Mediterranean Sea]], located on the coast between the mouths of the rivers [[Llobregat]] and [[Besòs (river)|Besòs]], and bounded to the west by the [[Serra de Collserola]] mountain range, the tallest peak of which is {{convert|512|m|ft|lk=out|abbr=off}} high.

Founded as a Roman city, in the Middle Ages Barcelona became the capital of the [[County of Barcelona]]. After merging with the [[Kingdom of Aragon]], Barcelona continued to be an important city in the [[Crown of Aragon]] as an economic and administrative centre of this Crown and the capital of the [[Principality of Catalonia]]. Barcelona has a rich cultural heritage and is today an important cultural centre and a major tourist destination. Particularly renowned are the architectural works of [[Antoni Gaudí]] and [[Lluís Domènech i Montaner]], which have been designated UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]]s. The headquarters of the [[Union for the Mediterranean]] are located in Barcelona. The city is known for hosting the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] as well as world-class [[Barcelona#Trade fair and exhibitions|conferences and expositions]] and also many [[Sport in Barcelona#International tournaments|international sport tournaments]].

Barcelona is one of the world's leading tourist, economic, trade fair and cultural centres, and its influence in commerce, education, entertainment, media, fashion, science, and the arts all contribute to its status as one of the [[global city|world's major global cities]].&lt;ref name="GAWC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2010t.html |title=The World According to GaWC 2010 |publisher=Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network, [[Loughborough University]] |accessdate=13 May 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010004859/http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2010t.html |archivedate=10 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/citylist.html |title=Inventory of World Cities |publisher=Globalization and World Cities (GaWC) Study Group and Network |accessdate=1 December 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014191556/http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/citylist.html |archivedate=14 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a major cultural and economic centre in [[Iberian Peninsula|southwestern Europe]], 24th in the world (before [[Zürich]], after [[Frankfurt]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atkearney.com/documents/10192/dfedfc4c-8a62-4162-90e5-2a3f14f0da3a |title=2012 Global Cities Index |date= |accessdate=30 March 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020223227/http://www.atkearney.com/documents/10192/dfedfc4c-8a62-4162-90e5-2a3f14f0da3a|archivedate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a financial centre.

==Names==

Collier &amp; Son Corporation|title=Collier's Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UpQVAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Barcino%22|year=1957|publisher=Collier|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During [[Middle Ages|the Middle Ages]], the city was variously known as ''Barchinona'', ''Barçalona'', ''Barchelonaa'', and ''Barchenona''.

Internationally, Barcelona's name is wrongly abbreviated to 'Barça'. However, this name refers only to [[FC Barcelona]], the football club. The common abbreviated form used by locals is ''Barna''.

Another common abbreviation is 'BCN', which is also the [[IATA airport code]] of the [[Barcelona-El Prat Airport]].

The city is also referred to as the ''Ciutat Comtal'' in [[Catalan language|Catalan]], and ''Ciudad Condal'' in Spanish, owing to its past as the seat of the [[Count of Barcelona]].

===Pre-history===
The origin of the earliest settlement at the site of present-day Barcelona is unclear. The ruins of an early settlement have been 
found, including different tombs and dwellings dating to earlier than 5000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Servei d'Arqueologia of Institut de Cultura de Barcelona|title=Caserna de Sant Pau del Camp|url=http://cartaarqueologica.bcn.cat/989|website=CartaArqueologica|publisher=Ajuntament de Barcelona|accessdate=2 May 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303224118/http://cartaarqueologica.bcn.cat/989 |archivedate=3 March 2016|page=Description and Historical Notes|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MontañaCamposFarré2008"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=MM Montaña |author2=OV Campos |author3=R Farré |title=Study of the Neolithic Excavation Site of the Sant Pau del Camp Barracks |journal=Quarhis |date=2008 |volume=II |issue=4 |page=3 |url=https://www.bcn.cat/.../04_QUARHIS_01_jaciment. |accessdate=2 May 2016 }}{{dead link|date=September 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founding of Barcelona is the subject of two different legends. The first attributes the founding of the city to the mythological [[Hercules]]. The second legend attributes the foundation of the city directly to the historical [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] general, [[Hamilcar Barca]], father of [[Hannibal]], who supposedly named the city ''Barcino'' after his family in the 3rd century BC,&lt;ref&gt;Oros. vii. 143; Miñano, ''Diccion.'' vol.&amp;nbsp;i. p.&amp;nbsp;391; Auson. ''Epist.'' xxiv. 68, 69, ''Punica Barcino''.&lt;/ref&gt; but there is no historical or linguistic evidence that this is true.&lt;ref name="Corporation1957"/&gt;

===Roman Barcelona===
In about 15&amp;nbsp;BC, the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] redrew the town as a ''[[castra|castrum]]'' (Roman military camp) centred on the "''Mons Taber''", a little hill near the contemporary city hall ([[Plaça de Sant Jaume]]). Under the Romans, it was a colony with the surname of ''Faventia'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder|Plin.]] iii. 3. s.&amp;nbsp;4&lt;/ref&gt; or, in full, ''Colonia Faventia Julia Augusta Pia Barcino''&lt;ref&gt;Inscr. ap. Gruter, p. 426, nos. 5, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Colonia Julia Augusta Faventia Paterna Barcino''. [[Pomponius Mela]]&lt;ref&gt;ii. 6&lt;/ref&gt; mentions it among the small towns of the district, probably as it was eclipsed by its neighbour ''[[Tarragona|Tarraco]]'' (modern [[Tarragona]]), but it may be gathered from later writers that it gradually grew in wealth and consequence, favoured as it was with a beautiful situation and an excellent harbour.&lt;ref&gt;Avien. ''Ora Maritima.'' 520: "Et Barcilonum amoena sedes ditium."&lt;/ref&gt; It enjoyed immunity from imperial burdens.&lt;ref&gt;Paul. Dig. 1. tit. 15, de Cens.&lt;/ref&gt; The city minted its own coins; some from the era of [[Galba]] survive.

Important Roman vestiges are displayed in [[Plaça del Rei]] underground, as a part of the [[Barcelona City History Museum]] (MUHBA); the typically Roman grid plan is still visible today in the layout of the historical centre, the ''[[El Gòtic|Barri Gòtic]]'' (Gothic Quarter). Some remaining fragments of the Roman walls have been incorporated into the cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bluffton.edu/~sullivanm/spain/barcelona/walls/walls.html |title=Roman walls, Barcelona |publisher=Bluffton.edu |accessdate=5 May 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723083724/http://www.bluffton.edu/~sullivanm/spain/barcelona/walls/walls.html |archivedate=23 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cathedral, also known as the Basilica ''La Seu'', is said to have been founded in 343.

===Medieval Barcelona===
The city was conquered by the [[Visigoths]] in the early 5th century, becoming for a few years the capital of all [[Hispania]]. After being conquered by the [[Arabs]] in the early 8th century, it was conquered in 801 by [[Charlemagne]]'s son [[Louis the Pious|Louis]], who made Barcelona the seat of the Carolingian "[[Marca Hispanica|Hispanic March]]" (''Marca Hispanica''), a [[buffer zone]] ruled by the [[Counts of Barcelona|Count of Barcelona]].

The Counts of Barcelona became increasingly independent and expanded their territory to include all of [[Catalonia]], although on 6 July 985, Barcelona was [[Looting|sacked]] by the army of [[Almanzor]].&lt;ref&gt;'''The Usatges of Barcelona: The Fundamental Law of Catalonia''', ed.

Kagay, (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1994), 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The sack was so traumatic that most of Barcelona's population was either killed or enslaved.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Collins, ''Caliphs and Kings, 796–1031'', (Blackwell Publishing, 2012), 191.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1137, [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]] and the [[Counts of Barcelona|County of Barcelona]] merged in [[dynastic union]]&lt;ref name="bisson_31"&gt;{{cite book |title=The medieval Crown of Aragon.

His territories were later to be known as the [[Crown of Aragon]], which conquered many overseas possessions and ruled the western [[Mediterranean Sea]] with outlying territories [[Naples|in Naples]] and Sicily and as far as [[Duchy of Athens|Athens]] in the 13th century. The forging of a dynastic link between the Crowns of Aragon and [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] marked the beginning of Barcelona's decline. The Bank of Barcelona (''[[:es:Taula de canvi|Taula de canvi]]''), probably the oldest public bank in Europe, was established by the city [[magistrate]]s in 1401. It originated from necessities of the state, as did the [[Medici Bank#Rise|Bank of Venice]] (1402) and the [[Bank of Saint George|Bank of Genoa]] (1407).&lt;ref&gt;The Bankers magazine, volume 11, page 595, J. Smith Homans Jr., New York 1857.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wyngaerde Barcelona 1563.jpg|thumb|Barcelona in 1563]]

===Barcelona under the Spanish monarchy===
The marriage of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella I of Castile]] in 1469 united the two royal lines. [[Madrid]] became the centre of political power whilst the colonisation of the Americas reduced the financial importance (at least in relative terms) of Mediterranean trade. Barcelona was a centre of [[Catalan separatism]], including the [[Reapers' War|Catalan Revolt]] (1640–52) against [[Philip IV of Spain]]. The [[plague (disease)|great plague]] of 1650–1654 halved the city's population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libro.uca.edu/payne1/payne15.htm Chapter 15: A History of Spain and Portugal], Stanley G.

[[File:Fortress on Montjuic.jpg|thumb|The [[Castle of Montjuïc|fortress at Montjuïc]], most southerly point from which measurements were made when calculating the [[meridional definition]] of the metre]]
In the 18th century, a fortress was built at [[Montjuïc]] that overlooked the harbour. In 1794, this fortress was used by the French astronomer [[Pierre Méchain|Pierre François André Méchain]] for observations relating to a survey stretching to [[Dunkirk]] that provided the official basis of the measurement of a metre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adler |first1=Ken|title=The Measure of All Things: The Seven-Year Odyssey that Transformed the World|year=2002|publisher=Abacus|isbn=978-0-349-11507-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definitive metre bar, manufactured from platinum, was presented to the French legislative assembly on 22 June 1799. Much of Barcelona was negatively affected by the [[Peninsular War|Napoleonic wars]], but the start of industrialisation saw the fortunes of the province improve. Urban planner [[Ildefons Cerdà]] designed the large [[Eixample]] district in the 1850s when the medieval city walls around Barcelona's old town were torn down.&lt;ref name="Boeing2016"/&gt;

===The Spanish civil war and the Franco period===
[[File:Government of the Republican Spain in Barcelona. 2.jpg|thumb|Barcelona was the capital of the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republic of Spain]] from November 1937 until January 1939, [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/museuhistoria/es/publicaciones/juan-negrin-1892-1956-barcelona-capital-de-la-republica|title=Juan Negrín 1892-1956.

In the image [[Manuel Azaña|Azaña]] and [[Juan Negrín|Negrín]] on the city outskirts.]]
During the [[Spanish Civil War]], the city, and Catalonia in general, were resolutely Republican. Many enterprises and public services were "collectivized" by the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] and UGT unions. As the power of the Republican government and the Generalitat diminished, much of the city was under the effective control of [[anarchist]] groups. The anarchists lost control of the city to their own allies, the Communists and official government troops, after the street fighting of the Barcelona May Days. The fall of the city on 26 January 1939, caused a mass exodus of civilians who fled to the French border. The resistance of Barcelona to [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s [[coup d'état]] was to have lasting effects after the defeat of the Republican government. The autonomous institutions of [[Catalonia]] were abolished,&lt;ref&gt;Decree of 5 April 1938.&lt;/ref&gt; and the use of the [[Catalan language]] in public life was suppressed. Barcelona remained the second largest city in Spain, at the heart of a region which was relatively industrialised and prosperous, despite the devastation of the [[Spanish Civil War|civil war]]. The result was a large-scale [[immigration]] from poorer regions of Spain (particularly [[Andalusia]], [[Murcia]] and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]), which in turn led to rapid urbanisation.

===Late twentieth century===
In 1992, Barcelona hosted the [[1992 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]]. The after-effects of this are credited with driving major changes in what had, up until then, been a largely industrial city. As part of the preparation for the games, industrial buildings along the sea-front were demolished and two miles of beach were created. New construction increased the road capacity of the city by 17%, the sewage handling capacity by 27% and the amount of new green areas and beaches by 78%. Between 1990 and 2004, the number of hotel rooms in the city doubled. Perhaps more importantly, the outside perception of the city was changed making, by 2012, Barcelona the 12th most popular city destination in the world and the 5th amongst European cities.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/53030/Barcelona Barcelona (Spain)]".

=== Recent history ===
{{Main|History of Barcelona|Timeline of Barcelona}}

The death of Franco in 1975 brought on a period of democratisation throughout Spain. Pressure for change was particularly strong in Barcelona, which considered (with some
justification) that it had been punished during nearly forty years of Francoism for its support of the Republican government.&lt;ref name="Mock2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Mock|title=Symbols of Defeat in the Construction of National Identity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xb-9J4KoT6EC&amp;pg=PA274|date=29 December 2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-50352-5|page=274}}&lt;/ref&gt; Massive, but peaceful, demonstrations on 11 September 1977 assembled over a million people in the streets of Barcelona to call for the restoration of Catalan autonomy. It was granted less than a month later.&lt;ref name="Friend2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Julius W.

The development of Barcelona was promoted by two events in 1986: [[History of the European Communities (1973-1993)|Spanish accession to the European Community]], and particularly Barcelona's designation as host city of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref name="ParkinSharma1999"&gt;{{cite book|author1=James Parkin|author2=D.

[[urban regeneration]] has been rapid, and accompanied by a greatly increased international reputation of the city as a tourist destination. The increased cost of housing has led to a slight decline (−16.6%) in the population over the last two decades of the 20th century as many families move out into the suburbs. This decline has been reversed since 2001, as a new wave of immigration (particularly from [[Latin America]] and from [[Morocco]]) has gathered pace.&lt;ref&gt;The proportion of the population born outside of Spain rose from 3.9% in 2001 to 13.9% in 2006. {{cite web|url=http://www.bcn.es/estadistica/catala/dades/inf/guies/bcn.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220062823/http://www.bcn.es/estadistica/catala/dades/inf/guies/bcn.pdf |archivedate=2012-02-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wide image|Barcelona. View from Tibidabo.jpg|800px|A panoramic view of Barcelona}}

===Location===
[[File:Barcelona ISS009-E-9987.jpg|thumb|right|Barcelona from high altitude]]

Barcelona is located on the northeast coast of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], facing the [[Mediterranean Sea]], on a [[plain]] approximately {{convert|5|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} wide limited by the mountain range of [[Serra de Collserola|Collserola]], the [[Llobregat]] river to the southwest and the [[Besòs (river)|Besòs]] river to the north.&lt;ref name="gec_3"&gt;{{cite encyclopaedia |encyclopedia=Gran Enciclopèdia Catalana |title=Barcelona |date=July 1971 |publisher=Edicions 62 |volume=3 |location=Barcelona |pages=193–229}}&lt;/ref&gt; This plain covers an area of {{convert|170|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name="gec_3"/&gt; of which {{convert|101|km²|1|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="guies_estadistiques"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bcn.es/estadistica/catala/dades/inf/guies/bcn.pdf |title=11 Barcelona.indd |format=PDF |accessdate=26 June 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220062823/http://www.bcn.es/estadistica/catala/dades/inf/guies/bcn.pdf |archivedate=20 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are occupied by the city itself. It is {{convert|120|km|0|abbr=off}} south of the [[Pyrenees]] and the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] border with France.

Barcelona is peppered with small hills, most of them urbanised, that gave their name to the neighbourhoods built upon them, such as [[El Carmel|Carmel]] ({{convert|267|m|ft|abbr=off|disp=or}}), [[:es:Putxet|Putget]] ({{convert|181|m|ft|abbr=off|disp=or}}) and Rovira ({{convert|261|m|ft|abbr=off||disp=or}}). The escarpment of [[Montjuïc]] ({{convert|173|m|ft|abbr=off|disp=or}}), situated to the southeast, overlooks the harbour and is topped by [[Montjuïc Castle]], a fortress built in the 17–18th centuries to control the city as a replacement for the Ciutadella. Today, the fortress is a museum and Montjuïc is home to several sporting and cultural venues, as well as Barcelona's biggest park and gardens.

The city borders on the municipalities of [[Santa Coloma de Gramenet]] and [[Sant Adrià de Besòs]] to the north; the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the east; [[El Prat de Llobregat]] and [[L'Hospitalet de Llobregat]] to the south; and [[Sant Feliu de Llobregat]], [[Sant Just Desvern]], [[Esplugues de Llobregat]], [[Sant Cugat del Vallès]], and [[Montcada i Reixac]] to the west. The municipality includes two small sparsely-inhabited [[exclave]]s to the north-west.

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Barcelona}}
According to the [[Köppen climate classification]], Barcelona has a maritime [[Mediterranean climate]] (''Csa''), with mild winters and warm to hot summers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ahrens |first=C. Donald |date=2012 |title=Meteorology Today: An Introduction to Weather, Climate, and the Environment, 10th Edition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9cD6CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA504 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn= 978-0840054999}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the rainiest seasons are autumn and spring. The rainfall pattern is characterized by a short (3 months) [[dry season]] in summer, as well as less winter rainfall than in a typical Mediterranean climate. This subtype, labelled as "Portuguese" by the French geographer George Viers after the climate classification of [[Emmanuel de Martonne]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Viers|first=Georges|date=1987|title=Climatología|trans-title=Climatology|language=Spanish|location=Barcelona|publisher=Oikos-Tau|isbn=9788428102957}}, pp.166-167&lt;/ref&gt; and found in the NW Mediterranean area (e.g. [[Marseille#Climate|Marseille]]), can be seen as transitional to the [[humid subtropical climate#Europe|humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa'') found in inland areas such as the [[Po Valley]] (e.g. [[Milan#Climate|Milan]]), whose rainfall is greater in summer, a feature of [[continental climate]]s.

Its average annual temperature is {{convert|21.2|°C|°F|abbr=on}} during the day and {{convert|15.1|°C|°F|abbr=on}} at night. The average annual temperature of the sea is about {{convert|20|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. In the coldest month, January, the temperature typically ranges from {{convert|12|to|18|C|F}} during the day, {{convert|6|to|12|C|F}} at night and the average sea temperature is {{convert|13|°C|°F|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="weather2travel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weather2travel.com/climate-guides/spain/barcelona.php|title=Weather2Travel.com: Barcelona Climate Guide|accessdate=16 June 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110718005932/http://www.weather2travel.com/climate-guides/spain/barcelona.php| archivedate= 18 July 2011| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the warmest month, August, the typical temperature ranges from {{convert|27|to|31|C|F}} during the day, about {{convert|23|°C|°F|abbr=on}} at night and the average sea temperature is {{convert|26|°C|°F|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=weather2travel/&gt; Generally, the summer or "holiday" season lasts about six months, from May to October. Two months – April and November – are transitional; sometimes the temperature exceeds {{convert|20|°C|0|abbr=on}}, with an average temperature of {{convert|18|-|19|C|F}} during the day and {{convert|11|-|13|C|F}} at night. December, January and February are the coldest months, with average temperatures around {{convert|15|°C|°F|abbr=on}} during the day and {{convert|9|°C|°F|abbr=on}} at night. Large fluctuations in temperature are rare, particularly in the summer months. Because of the proximity to the warm sea, frosts are very rare in the city of Barcelona. In fact, only 1 day in the last 30 years was recorded with a temperature under the freezing mark, {{convert|-1|°C|°F|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;http://w1.bcn.cat/temps/docs/Can_Bruixa%201987-2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Snow is very infrequent.

Barcelona averages 78 rainy days per year (≥ 1&amp;nbsp;mm), and annual average relative humidity is 72%, ranging from 69% in July to 75% in October. Rainfall totals are highest in late summer and autumn (September–November) and lowest in early and mid-summer (June–August), with a secondary winter minimum (February–March). Sunshine duration is 2,524&amp;nbsp;hours per year, from 138 (average 4.5&amp;nbsp;hours of sunshine a day) in December to 310 (average 10&amp;nbsp;hours of sunshine a day) in July.&lt;ref name="Meteorología"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aemet.es/es/serviciosclimaticos/datosclimatologicos/valoresclimatologicos?l=0076&amp;k=cat |title=Valores Climatológicos Normales.

==Demographics==
[[File:Demografía Barcelona (España).PNG|right|upright=1.35|thumb|Demographic evolution, 1900–2007, according to the Spanish Instituto Nacional de Estadística]]

According to Barcelona's City Council, Barcelona's population {{as of|2016|January|1|lc=y}} was 1,608,746&amp;nbsp;people,&lt;ref name="ASTBCN"&gt;[http://www.bcn.cat/estadistica/angles/dades/tpob/index.htm "Ajuntament de Barcelona - Population, household and homes statistics"], retrieved 12 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; on a land area of {{convert|101.4|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}. It is the main component of an [[Àrea Metropolitana de Barcelona|administrative area of Greater Barcelona]], with a population of 3,218,071 in an area of {{convert|636|km²|0|abbr=off}} (density 5,060 hab/km²). The population of the urban area was 4,840,000.&lt;ref name="demographia"/&gt; It is the central nucleus of the [[Barcelona metropolitan area]], which relies on a population of 5,474,482.&lt;ref name="eurostat"&gt;[http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=met_pjanaggr3&amp;lang=en Population on 1 January by broad age group, sex and metropolitan regions] - [[Eurostat]], 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Spanish Language|Spanish]] is the most spoken language in Barcelona (according to the linguistic census held by the Government of Catalonia in 2013) and it is understood almost universally. After Spanish, the [[Catalan language]] is the second most spoken one in the city, and it is understood by 95% of the population, while 72.3% can speak it, 79% can read it, and 53% can write it,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Departament d'Estadística.

In 1900, Barcelona had a population of 533,000 people,&lt;ref name="gec_3"/&gt; which grew steadily but slowly until 1950, when it started absorbing a high number of people from other less-industrialized parts of Spain. Barcelona's population peaked in 1979 with 1,906,998 people, and fell throughout the 1980s and 1990s as more people sought a higher [[quality of life]] in outlying cities in the Barcelona Metropolitan Area. After bottoming out in 2000 with 1,496,266 people, the city's population began to rise again as younger people started to return, causing a great increase in housing prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bcn.es/estadistica/catala/dades/anuari/cap02/C0201010.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221131641/http://www.bcn.es/estadistica/catala/dades/anuari/cap02/C0201010.htm |archivedate=21 December 2007 |title=Ajuntament de Barcelona: Estadística: Evolució de la població. 1900–2005 |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=26 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Population density===
[[File:14-08-06-barcelona-RalfR-314.jpg|thumb|left|View over the [[Passeig de Gràcia]] avenue]]
''Note: This text is entirely based on the municipal statistical database provided by the city council.''

Barcelona is one of the most densely populated cities in Europe. For the year 2008 the city council calculated the population to 1,621,090 living in the 102.2&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; sized municipality, giving the city an average population density of 15,926 inhabitants per square kilometre with [[Eixample]] being the most populated district.

In the case of Barcelona though, the land distribution is extremely uneven. Half of the municipality or 50.2&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, all of it located on the municipal edge is made up of the ten least densely populated neighbourhoods containing less than 10% of the city's population, the uninhabited [[Zona Franca (Barcelona)|Zona Franca]] industrial area and [[Montjuïc]] forest park. Leaving the remaining 90% or slightly below 1.5 million inhabitants living on the remaining {{convert|52|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=off}} at an average density close to 28,500 inhabitants per square kilometre.

Of the 73 neighbourhoods in the city, 45 had a population density above 20,000 inhabitants per square kilometre with a combined population of 1,313,424 inhabitants living on 38.6&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at an average density of 33,987 inhabitants per square km. The 30 most densely populated neighbourhoods accounted for 57.5% of the city population occupying only 22,7% of the municipality, or in other words, 936,406 people living at an average density of 40,322 inhabitants per square kilometre. The city's highest density is found at and around the neighbourhood of [[Sagrada Família, Barcelona|la Sagrada Família]] where four of the city's most densely populated neighbourhoods are located side by side, all with a population density above 50,000 inhabitants per square kilometre.

In 2016 about 59% of the inhabitants of the city were born in [[Catalonia]] and 18.5% coming from the rest of the country. In addition to that, 22.5% of the population was born outside of Spain, a proportion which has more than doubled since 2001 and more than quintupled since 1996 when it was 8.6% respectively 3.9%.&lt;ref name="ASTBCN" /&gt;

The most important region of origin of migrants is Europe, with many coming from [[Italy]] (26,676) or [[France]] (13,506).&lt;ref name="ASTBCN" /&gt; Moreover, many migrants come from [[Latin America]]n nations as [[Bolivia]], [[Ecuador]] or [[Colombia]]. Since the 1990s, and similar to other migrants, many Latin Americans have settled in northern parts of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Sian Preece |title=The Routledge Handbook of Language and Identity |publisher=Routledge |year=2016 |page=513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There exists a relatively large [[Pakistan]]i community in Barcelona with up to twenty thousand nationals. The community consists of significantly more men than women. Many of the Pakistanis are living in [[Ciutat Vella]]. First Pakistani migrants came in the 1970s, with increasing numbers in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barcelona-metropolitan.com/features/report-barcelona-pakistani-community/ "Barcelona's Pakistani community"], retrieved 12 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other significant migrant groups come from Asia as from [[China]] and the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref name="ASTBCN" /&gt; There is a Japanese community clustered in [[Bonanova]], [[Les Tres Torres]], [[Pedralbes]], and other northern neighbourhoods, and a [[Colegio Japonés de Barcelona|Japanese international school]] serves that community.&lt;ref&gt;Conte-Helm, Marie.

Barcelona has a long-standing mercantile tradition. Less well known is that the city industrialised early, taking off in 1833, when Catalonia's already sophisticated textile industry began to use steam power. It became the first and most important industrial city in the Mediterranean basin. Since then, manufacturing has played a large role in its history.

[[Bolsa de Valores de Barcelona|Borsa de Barcelona]] (Barcelona Stock Exchange) is the main stock exchange in the northeastern part of the Iberian Peninsula.

Barcelona was recognised as the Southern European City of the Future for 2014/15, based on its economic potential,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w42.bcn.cat/web/en/noticies-i-premsa/noticies/actives/Barcelona-recognized-as-the-top-Southern-European-city-with-future-economic-potential.jsp|title=Barcelona, recognized as the top Southern European city with future economic potential |date=5 March 2014|accessdate=11 April 2014|website=Barcelona Growth|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413160012/http://w42.bcn.cat/web/en/noticies-i-premsa/noticies/actives/Barcelona-recognized-as-the-top-Southern-European-city-with-future-economic-potential.jsp|archivedate=13 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; by ''[[FDi Magazine]]'' in their bi-annual rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fdiintelligence.com/Locations/Europe/European-Cities-and-Regions-of-the-Future-2014-15|title=European Cities and Regions of the Future 2014/15 |date=17 February 2014|accessdate=11 April 2014|work=fDi Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trade fair and exhibitions===
{{double image|right|World Trade Center Barcelona 2013 2.jpg|180|Palau de Congressos de Barcelona 2013.JPG|180|The [[World Trade Center Barcelona]]|The Palau de Congressos de Barcelona}}

Drawing upon its tradition of creative art and craftsmanship, Barcelona is known for its award-winning [[industrial design]]. It also has several congress halls, notably [[Fira de Barcelona]] – the second largest trade fair and exhibition centre in Europe, that host a quickly growing number of national and international events each year (at present above 50). The total exhibition floor space of Fira de Barcelona venues is {{convert|405,000|m2|ha|0|abbr=on}}, not counting [[Gran Via (Barcelona)|Gran Via centre]] on the [[Plaza de Europa]]. However, the [[Eurozone crisis]] and deep cuts in business travel affected the Council's positioning of the city as a convention centre.

An important business centre, the [[World Trade Center Barcelona]], is located in Barcelona's [[Port Vell]] harbour.

The city is known for hosting well as world-class conferences and expositions, including the 1888 ''[[Exposición Universal de Barcelona]]'', the [[1929 Barcelona International Exposition]] (Expo 1929), the [[2004 Universal Forum of Cultures]] and the 2004 [[World Urban Forum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Urban Forum 2004|url=http://mirror.unhabitat.org/categories.asp?catid=467|accessdate=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its large influx of tourists each year, Barcelona, like many other tourism capitals, has to deal with pickpockets, with wallets and passports being commonly stolen items. For this reason, most travel guides recommend that visitors take precautions in order to ensure their possessions' safety, especially inside the metro premises. Despite its moderate pickpocket rate, Barcelona is considered one of the safest cities in terms of health security and personal safety,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/the-20-safest-cities-in-the-world-2015-1|title=20 Of The Safest Cities In The World|newspaper=Business Insider|access-date=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; mainly because of a sophisticated policing strategy that has dropped crime by 32% in just over three years and has led it to be considered the 15th safest city in the world by [[Business Insider]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/the-15-safest-cities-in-the-world-2016-12/#15-barcelona-7516-three-years-ago-the-barcelona-city-council-decided-to-increase-the-police-presence-on-the-streets-and-in-the-subway-the-strategy-has-yielded-results-with-crime-falling-by-32-1|title=The 15 safest cities in the world|newspaper=Business Insider|access-date=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While tourism produces economic benefits, the city is "overrun" ... by "hordes of tourists" according to one report. In early 2017, over 150,000 protesters warned that tourism is destabilizing the city. Slogans included "Tourists go home", "Barcelona is not for sale" and "We will not be driven out". By then, number of visitors had increased from 1.7 million in 1990 to 32 million in a city with a population of 1.62 million, increasing the cost of rental housing for residents and overcrowding the public places. While tourists spent an estimated €30 billion in 2017, they are viewed by some as a threat to Barcelona's identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Burgen |first=Stephen |date=25 June 2018 |title='Tourists go home, refugees welcome': why Barcelona chose migrants over visitors|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/jun/25/tourists-go-home-refugees-welcome-why-barcelona-chose-migrants-over-visitors |work=The Guardian |location=London |access-date=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A May 2017 article in England's [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] newspaper included Barcelona among the ''Eight Places That Hate Tourists the Most'' and included a comment from Mayor [[Ada Colau]], "We don’t want the city to become a cheap souvenir shop [like Venice]". To moderate the problem, the city has stopped issuing licenses for new hotels and holiday apartments; it also fined AirBnb with a €30,000. The mayor has suggested an additional tourist tax and setting a limit on the number of visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Coffey |first=Helen |date=15 May 2017 |title=Eight Places That Hate Tourists the Most |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/places-hate-tourist-the-most-countries-ban-visitors-venice-thailand-amsterdam-japan-onsen-santorini-a7733136.html |work=The Independent |location=London |access-date=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One industry insider, Justin Francis, founder of the [[responsibletravel.com|Responsible Travel]] agency, stated that steps must be taken to limit the number of visitors that are causing an "overtourism crisis" in several major European cities.

As in other modern cities, the [[Secondary sector of the economy|manufacturing sector]] has long since been overtaken by the services sector, though it remains very important. The region's leading industries are [[textiles]], chemical, [[pharmaceutical]], motor, electronic, printing, [[logistics]], [[publishing]], in [[telecommunications]] industry and culture the notable [[Mobile World Congress]], and [[information technology]] services.

{{main|Fashion in Barcelona}}
The traditional importance of textiles is reflected in Barcelona's drive to become a major fashion centre. There have been many attempts to launch Barcelona as a [[Fashion in Barcelona|fashion capital]], notably ''Gaudi Home''.{{citation needed|reason=who or what is Gaudi Home; need cite for it and more info|date=January 2014}}

Beginning in the summer of 2000, the city hosted the prestigious [[Bread and Butter tradeshow|Bread &amp; Butter urban fashion fair]] until 2009, when its organisers announced that it would be returning to [[Berlin]]. This was a hard blow for the city as the fair brought €100&amp;nbsp;m to the city in just three days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=La feria de moda urbana Bread and Butter deja Barcelona |author=Leticia Blanco |work=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]] |date=20 January 2009 |url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2009/01/19/barcelona/1232400722.html |accessdate=22 July 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113115745/http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2009/01/19/barcelona/1232400722.html |archivedate=13 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[El Periódico de Catalunya|El Periódico]] |title=El presidente del Bread&amp;Butter confirma oficialmente que la feria abandona Barcelona |author=EFE |author-link=EFE |date=23 January 2009 |url=http://www.elperiodico.com/default.asp?idpublicacio_PK=46&amp;idioma=CAS&amp;idtipusrecurs_PK=7&amp;idnoticia_PK=580966 |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160515183129/http://www.elperiodico.com/default.asp?idpublicacio_PK=46&amp;idioma=CAS&amp;idtipusrecurs_PK=7&amp;idnoticia_PK=580966 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=15 May 2016 |quote=[Karl Heinz Muller, the entrepreneur behind B&amp;B in announcing the move in a press conference held on January 23, 2009 said] No llores Barcelona, levántate y haz algo [don't cry Barcelona, get up and do something about it] Barcelona in Europe is a metropolis of fashion. |accessdate=22 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the capital of the autonomous community of [[Catalonia]], Barcelona is the seat of the Catalan government, known as the ''[[Generalitat of Catalonia|Generalitat de Catalunya]]''; of particular note are the [[Government of Catalonia|executive branch]], the [[Parliament of Catalonia|parliament]], and the [[High Court of Justice of Catalonia]]. The city is also the capital of the [[Province of Barcelona]] and the [[Barcelonès]] [[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]] (district).

Barcelona is governed by a city council formed by 41 city councillors, [[Municipal elections in Barcelona|elected]] for a four-year term by [[universal suffrage]]. As one of the two biggest cities in Spain, Barcelona is subject to a special law articulated through the ''Carta Municipal'' (Municipal Law). A first version of this law was passed in 1960 and amended later, but the current version was approved in March 2006.&lt;ref name="ley 1/2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boe.es/g/es/bases_datos/doc.php?coleccion=iberlex&amp;id=2006/04583 |title=BOE – LEY 1/2006, de 13 de marzo, por la que se regula el Régimen Especial del municipio de Barcelona |publisher=Boe.es |date=14 March 2006 |accessdate=26 June 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430052956/http://www.boe.es/g/es/bases_datos/doc.php?coleccion=iberlex&amp;id=2006%2F04583 |archivedate=30 April 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this law, Barcelona's city council is organised in two levels: a political one, with elected city councillors, and one executive, which administrates the programs and executes the decisions taken on the political level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w3.bcn.es/V61/Home/V61HomeLinkPl/0,2687,200713899_200720868_1,00.html |title=Ajuntament de Barcelona&gt; Ajuntament&gt; El Govern de la Ciutat |publisher=W3.bcn.es |accessdate=26 June 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728231233/http://w3.bcn.es/V61/Home/V61HomeLinkPl/0%2C2687%2C200713899_200720868_1%2C00.html |archivedate=28 July 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This law also gives the local government a special relationship with the central government and it also gives the mayor wider prerogatives by the means of municipal executive commissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bcn.cat/catala/laciutat/barcelona/organitzacio.htm |title=Ajuntament de Barcelona: Organització política |publisher=Bcn.cat |accessdate=26 June 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723081931/http://www.bcn.cat/catala/laciutat/barcelona/organitzacio.htm |archivedate=23 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It expands the powers of the city council in areas like telecommunications, city traffic, [[road traffic safety|road safety]] and [[public safety]].

Some of these competencies are not exclusive, but shared with the Generalitat de Catalunya or the central [[Government of Spain|Spanish government]].

The executive branch is led by a Chief Municipal Executive Officer which answers to the Mayor. It is made up of departments which are legally part of the city council and by separate legal entities of two types: autonomous public departments and public enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w3.bcn.es/V61/Home/V61HomeLinkPl/0,4358,200713899_200722250_3,00.html |title=Ajuntament de Barcelona&gt; Council&gt; The municipal administration |publisher=W3.bcn.es |accessdate=26 June 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100622011903/http://w3.bcn.es/V61/Home/V61HomeLinkPl/0%2C4358%2C200713899_200722250_3%2C00.html |archivedate=22 June 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The seat of the city council is on the Plaça de Sant Jaume, opposite the seat of Generalitat de Catalunya. Since the [[Spanish transition to democracy|coming of the Spanish democracy]], Barcelona [[Municipal elections in Barcelona|had been governed]] by the [[Socialists' Party of Catalonia|PSC]], first with an [[absolute majority]] and later in coalition with [[Republican Left of Catalonia|ERC]] and [[Initiative for Catalonia Greens|ICV]]. After the May 2007 election, the ERC did not renew the coalition agreement and the PSC governed in a minority coalition with ICV as the junior partner.

After 32 years, on 22 May 2011, [[Convergence and Union|CiU]] gained a plurality of seats at the municipal election, gaining 15 seats to the PSC's 11. The [[People's Party (Spain)|PP]] hold 8 seats, ICV 5 and ERC 2.

===Districts===
[[File:Districtes de Barcelona.svg|right|thumb|Districts of Barcelona]]
{{main|Districts of Barcelona}}

Since 1987, the city has been divided into 10&amp;nbsp;administrative [[Districts of Barcelona|districts]] (''districtes'' in Catalan, ''distritos'' in Spanish):
* [[Ciutat Vella]]
* [[Eixample]]
* [[Sants-Montjuïc]]
* [[District of Les Corts|Les Corts]]
* [[Sarrià-Sant Gervasi]]
* [[Gràcia]]
* [[Horta-Guinardó]]
* [[Nou Barris]]
* [[Sant Andreu]]
* [[Sant Martí (district)|Sant Martí]]

The districts are based mostly on historical divisions, and several are former towns annexed by the city of Barcelona in the 18th and 19th centuries that still maintain their own distinct character. Each district has its own council led by a city councillor. The composition of each district council depends on the number of votes each political party had in that district, so a district can be led by a councillor from a different party than the executive council.

==Education==
{{Main|Education in Spain}}
[[File:Universidad de Barcelona, Canciller del Ecuador ofrece conferencia (11986731433).jpg|thumb|Main hall of the [[University of Barcelona]]]]

Barcelona has a well-developed higher education system of [[public university|public universities]]. Most prominent among these is the [[University of Barcelona]] (established in 1450), a world-renowned research and teaching institution with campuses around the city. Barcelona is also home to the [[Polytechnic University of Catalonia]], and the newer [[Pompeu Fabra University]], and, in the private sector the [[EADA Business School]] founded in 1957, became the first Barcelona institution to run manager training programmes for the business community. [[IESE|IESE Business School]], as well as the largest private educational institution, the [[Ramon Llull University]], which encompasses internationally prestigious schools and institutes such as the [[ESADE]] Business School. The [[Autonomous University of Barcelona]], another public university, is located in [[Bellaterra]], a town in the [[Àmbit metropolità de Barcelona|Metropolitan Area]]. [[Toulouse Business School]] and the [[Open University of Catalonia]] (a private Internet-centred open university) are also based in Barcelona.
[[File:Barcelona. University of Barcelona, faculty of Law. Lopez Iñigo, Subias Fages and Giráldez Dávila, architects (1958) (14958318511).jpg|thumb|Building of the faculty of Law of the University of Barcelona]]

The city has a network of public schools, from nurseries to high schools, under the responsibility of a consortium led by city council (though the curriculum is the responsibility of the Generalitat de Catalunya). There are also many private schools, some of them Roman Catholic. Most such schools receive a public subsidy on a per-student basis, are subject to inspection by the public authorities, and are required to follow the same curricular guidelines as public schools, though they charge tuition. Known as ''escoles concertades'', they are distinct from schools whose funding is entirely private (''escoles privades'').

The language of instruction at public schools and ''escoles concertades'' is Catalan, as stipulated by the 2009 Catalan Education Act. Spanish may be used as a language of instruction by teachers of Spanish literature or language, and foreign languages by teachers of those languages. An experimental partial immersion programme adopted by some schools allows for the teaching of a foreign language (English, generally) across the curriculum, though this is limited to a maximum of 30% of the school day. No public school or ''escola concertada'' in Barcelona may offer 50% or full immersion programmes in a foreign language, nor does any public school or ''escola concertada'' offer International Baccalaureate programmes.

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Barcelona}}
Barcelona's cultural roots go back 2000 years. Since the [[Spanish transition to democracy|arrival of democracy]], the Catalan language (very much repressed during the [[Spanish State|dictatorship of Franco]]) has been promoted, both by recovering works from the past and by stimulating the creation of new works.

=== Squatter's Movement ===
Barcelona is also home to numerous [[Social center|social centres]] and [[Squatting|illegal squats]] that effectively form a shadow society mainly made up of the unemployed, immigrants, dropouts, [[Anarchism|anarchists]], [[Anti-authoritarianism|anti-authoritarians]] and [[Autonomism|autonomists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=To Get to the Other Side: a journey through Europe and its anarchist movements|last=Gelderloos|first=Peter|publisher=|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Gelderloos]] estimates that there around 200 squatted buildings and 40 social centres across the city with thousands of inhabitants, making it one of the largest squatter movements in the world. He notes that they pirate electricity, internet and water allowing them to live on less than one euro a day. He argues that these squats embrace an [[Anarcho-communism|anarcho-communist]] and [[anti-work]] philosophy, often freely fixing up new houses, cleaning, patching roofs, installing windows, toilets, showers, lights and kitchens. In the wake of austerity, the squats have provided a number of [[social services]] to the surrounding residents, including [[bicycle]] repair workshops, [[carpentry]] workshops, [[self-defense]] classes, free [[libraries]], [[Community gardening|community gardens]], free meals, [[computer]] labs, language classes, theatre groups, free medical care and legal support services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anarchy Works|last=Gelderloos|first=Peter|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The squats help elderly residents avoid eviction and organise various protests throughout Barcelona. Notable squats include [[Can Vies]] and [[Can Masdeu]]s. Police have repeatedly tried to shut down the squatters movement with waves of evictions and raids, but the movement is still going strong.

The Maremagnum, being situated within the confines of the port, is the only commercial mall in the city that can open on Sundays and public holidays.

===Railway===
[[File:Barcelona - Estación de Sants y Hotel Barceló Sants 2.jpg|thumb|The main railway station [[Barcelona Sants railway station|Estación de Sants]]]]

Barcelona is a major hub for [[RENFE]], the Spanish state railway network. The city's main [[Inter-city rail]] [[railway station|station]] is [[Barcelona Sants railway station]], whilst [[Estació de França]] terminus serves a secondary role handling suburban, regional and medium distance services. Freight services operate to local industries and to the Port of Barcelona.

RENFE's [[AVE]] [[high-speed rail]] system, which is designed for speeds of {{convert|310|km/h|0|abbr=on}}, was extended from [[Madrid]] to Barcelona in 2008 in the form of the [[Madrid–Barcelona high-speed rail line]]. A shared RENFE-SNCF high-speed rail connecting Barcelona and France ([[Paris]], [[Marseilles]] and [[Toulouse]], through [[Perpignan–Barcelona high-speed rail line]]) was launched in 2013. Both these lines serve Barcelona Sants terminal station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avui.cat/noticia/article/2-societat/5-societat/252283-barcelona-estrena-tgv.html|title=Barcelona estrena TGV|publisher=[[Avui]]|date=9 February 2008 |accessdate=11 July 2011 |language=catalan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catalannewsagency.com/politics/item/the-last-high-speed-railway-stretch-between-barcelona-and-france-has-finally-been-unveiled-after-years-of-delays|title=The last High Speed railway stretch between Barcelona and France has finally been unveiled after years of delays|publisher=Catalan News Agency|date=8 January 2013|accessdate=27 January 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140410223210/http://www.catalannewsagency.com/politics/item/the-last-high-speed-railway-stretch-between-barcelona-and-france-has-finally-been-unveiled-after-years-of-delays|archivedate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides RENFE's services, other rail services in the Barcelona area are operated by the [[Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya]] (FGC), owned by the Catalan government. The FGC operates largely [[commuter rail]] services, but also carries freight to the Port of Barcelona, as well as a number of [[rack railway]]s and [[funicular]]s and three of the lines of the [[Barcelona Metro]] (see [[#Local public transport|''local public transport'']] below). Other suburban services are operated by [[Rodalies de Catalunya]] over RENFE tracks.

===Roads and highways===
[[File:BCN-rdaDalt-9976sh.jpg|thumb|upright|[[B-20 motorway (Spain)|B-20 motorway]] in Barcelona.]]

Barcelona lies on three international routes, including [[European route E15]] that follows the Mediterranean coast, [[European route E90]] to Madrid and Lisbon, and [[European route E09]] to Paris. It is also served by a comprehensive network of motorways and highways throughout the metropolitan area, including [[Autovía A-2|A-2]], [[Autovía A-7|A-7]]/[[Autopista AP-7|AP-7]], [[C-16 highway (Spain)|C-16]], [[C-17 highway (Spain)|C-17]], [[C-31 highway (Spain)|C-31]], [[C-32 highway (Spain)|C-32]], [[Autopista C-33|C-33]], [[Autovia C-60|C-60]].

The city is circled by three half [[Beltway|ring roads]] or bypasses, [[B20 motorway (Spain)|Ronda de Dalt (B-20)]] (on the mountain side), [[B10 motorway (Spain)|Ronda del Litoral (B-10)]] (along the coast) and [[Ronda del Mig]] (separated into two parts: [[Travessera de Dalt]] in the north and the [[Gran Via de Carles III]]), two partially covered&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bcn.es/turisme/english/turisme/rutes/rondes_fr.htm |title=The covered Rondes (by-pass) |publisher=Bcn.es |accessdate=26 June 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090516235933/http://www.bcn.es/turisme/english/turisme/rutes/rondes_fr.htm |archivedate=16 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; fast highways with several exits that bypass the city.

The city's main arteries include [[Avinguda Diagonal, Barcelona|Diagonal Avenue]], which crosses it diagonally, [[Avinguda Meridiana, Barcelona|Meridiana Avenue]] which leads to [[Plaça de les Glòries Catalanes, Barcelona|Glòries]] and connects with Diagonal Avenue and [[Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes, Barcelona|Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes]], which crosses the city from east to west, passing through its centre. The famous boulevard of [[La Rambla, Barcelona|La Rambla]], whilst no longer an important vehicular route, remains an important pedestrian route.

The [[Estació del Nord Sports Hall|Estació del Nord]] (Northern Station), a former [[railway station]] which was renovated for the 1992 Olympic Games, now serves as the terminus for long-distance and regional bus services.

===Local public transport===
[[File:LlefiàL10.JPG|thumb|right|Barcelona Metro]]

Barcelona is served by a comprehensive local public transport network that includes a [[rapid transit|metro]], a [[bus]] network, two separate modern tram networks, a separate historic tram line, and several funiculars and [[aerial tramway|aerial cable cars]]. Most of these networks and lines form a coordinated fare system, administered by the [[Autoritat del Transport Metropolità]] (ATM), although they are operated by a number of different bodies. This integrated public transport is divided into different zones (1 to 6) and depending on usage various Integrated Travel Cards&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tmb.cat/en/abonaments-integrats|title=Integrated travel cards – Transports Metropolitans de Barcelona|author=|date=|work=tmb.cat}}&lt;/ref&gt; are available.

The largely underground [[Barcelona Metro]] network comprises twelve lines, identified by an "L" followed by the line number as well as by individual colours. Eight of these lines are operated on dedicated track by the [[Transports Metropolitans de Barcelona]] (TMB), whilst four lines are operated by the [[Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya]] (FGC) and some of them share tracks with that company's commuter lines.

Another company, [[TRAMMET]], operates the city's two modern tram networks, known as [[Trambaix]] and [[Trambesòs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w3.bcn.es/V01/Serveis/Noticies/V01NoticiesLlistatNoticiesCtl/0,2138,1653_35144087_1_573780100,00.html?accio=detall&amp;home=HomeBCN&amp;nomtipusMCM=Noticia |title=News related with the council plans for the tram network union |publisher=W3.bcn.es |accessdate=26 June 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003195712/http://w3.bcn.es/V01/Serveis/Noticies/V01NoticiesLlistatNoticiesCtl/0%2C2138%2C1653_35144087_1_573780100%2C00.html?accio=detall&amp;home=HomeBCN&amp;nomtipusMCM=Noticia |archivedate= 3 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The historic tram line, the [[Tramvia Blau]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tmb.net/en_US/barcelona/moute/planols/planotramviablau.jsp |title=Information of Tramvia Blau |publisher=Tmb.net |accessdate=26 June 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091224023817/http://www.tmb.net/en_US/barcelona/moute/planols/planotramviablau.jsp |archivedate=24 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; connects the metro (L7, operated by FGC) to the [[Funicular del Tibidabo]] (operated by TMB). The Funicular de Tibidabo climbs the Tibidabo hill, as does the [[Funicular de Vallvidrera]] (FGC). The [[Funicular de Montjuïc]] (TMB) climbs the [[Montjuïc]] hill. The city has two [[aerial lift|aerial cable cars]]: the [[Montjuïc Cable Car]] (to the Montjuïc castle) and the [[Port Vell Aerial Tramway]] that runs via [[Torre Jaume I]] and [[Torre Sant Sebastia|Torre Sant Sebastià]] over the port.

Buses in Barcelona are a major form of public transport, with extensive local, interurban and night bus networks. Most local services are operated by the TMB, although some other services are operated by a number of private companies, albeit still within the ATM fare structure. A separate private bus line, known as Aerobús, links the airport with the city centre, with its own fare structure.

Barcelona has a [[taxicab|metered taxi]] fleet governed by the Institut Metropolità del Taxi (Metropolitan Taxi Institute), composed of more than 10,000 cars. Most of the licences are in the hands of [[Self-employment|self-employed]] drivers. With their black and yellow livery, Barcelona's taxis are easily spotted, and can be caught from one of many [[taxi rank]]s, hailed on street, called by telephone or via app.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.barcelona.com/barcelona_city_guide/all_about/taxis_in_barcelona | title = Barcelona Taxi Information | work = Barcelona.com | accessdate = 28 January 2014| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140202102147/http://www.barcelona.com/barcelona_city_guide/all_about/taxis_in_barcelona | archivedate = 2 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bcnweb2.bcn.es:8885/taxi/infocorp/informacio.html|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20031208074138/http://bcnweb2.bcn.es:8885/taxi/infocorp/informacio.html|deadurl=yes|title=Invalid Host Specified|date=8 December 2003|archivedate=8 December 2003|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main sights==
[[File:Sagrada Familia 01.jpg|thumb|[[Sagrada Família]] church, designed by [[Antoni Gaudí|Gaudí]]]]

The ''[[El Gòtic|Barri Gòtic]]'' (Catalan for "Gothic Quarter") is the centre of the old city of Barcelona. Many of the buildings date from medieval times, some from as far back as the Roman settlement of Barcelona. Catalan ''[[Modernisme|modernista]]'' architecture (related to the movement known as [[Art Nouveau]] in the rest of Europe) developed between 1885 and 1950 and left an important legacy in Barcelona. Several of these buildings are [[World Heritage Site]]s. Especially remarkable is the work of architect [[Antoni Gaudí]], which can be seen throughout the city. His best-known work is the immense but still unfinished church of the [[Sagrada Família]], which has been under construction since 1882 and is still financed by private donations. {{As of|2015}}, completion is planned for 2026.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/11/sagrada-familia-reaches-its-final-stage-of-construction/413476/ | title = Gaudí's Barcelona Basilica, La Sagrada Família, Reaches Its Final Stage of Construction - The Atlantic | publisher = The Atlantic | accessdate = 1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barcelona was also home to [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe|Mies van der Rohe]]'s [[Barcelona Pavilion]]. Designed in 1929 for the [[1929 Barcelona International Exposition|International Exposition]] for Germany, it was an iconic building that came to symbolise modern architecture as the embodiment of van der Rohe's aphorisms "less is more" and "God is in the details." The Barcelona pavilion was intended as a temporary structure and was torn down in 1930 less than a year after it was constructed. A modern re-creation by Spanish architects now stands in Barcelona, however, constructed in 1986.

Barcelona won the 1999 [[Royal Institute of British Architects|RIBA]] [[Royal Gold Medal]] for its architecture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.architecture.com/Files/RIBATrust/Awards/RoyalGoldMedal/Royal%20Gold%20Medallists%201848%20-%202008.pdf | title = RIBA Royal Gold Medallists | publisher = RIBA | accessdate = 28 January 2014| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140202101307/http://www.architecture.com/Files/RIBATrust/Awards/RoyalGoldMedal/Royal%20Gold%20Medallists%201848%20-%202008.pdf | archivedate = 2 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the first (and {{As of|2015|lc=y}}, only) time that the winner has been a city rather than an individual architect.

===World Heritage Sites===
Barcelona is the home of many points of interest declared [[World Heritage Site]]s by [[UNESCO]]:&lt;ref&gt;The seventh element of Place [[World Heritage]] "Works of [[Antoni Gaudí]]" is the Crypt in [[Colònia Güell]], which is located at [[Santa Coloma de Cervelló]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parks===
[[File:Parc de la Ciutadella Barcelona Mai 2013.jpg|thumb|[[Parc de la Ciutadella]] north of [[La Barceloneta]]]]
Barcelona contains sixty municipal parks, twelve of which are historic, five of which are thematic (botanical), forty-five of which are [[urban park|urban]], and six of which are forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Parcs i Jardins, Institut Municipal |url=http://www.bcn.es/parcsijardins/cat/parcs/pa_mapa.htm |title=Parcs i Jardins&gt; Els Parcs&gt; Els Parcs de Barcelona |publisher=Bcn.es |accessdate=26 June 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105064630/http://www.bcn.es/parcsijardins/cat/parcs/pa_mapa.htm|archivedate=5 January 2010|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; They range from vest-pocket parks to large recreation areas. The urban parks alone cover 10% of the city ({{convert|549.7|ha|acre|1|disp=or|abbr=on}}).&lt;ref name="guies_estadistiques"/&gt; The total park surface grows about {{convert|10|ha|acre|0|abbr=on}} per year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Parcs i Jardins, Institut Municipal|url=http://www.bcn.es/parcsijardins/cat/parcs/pa_his_ciu.htm |title=Parcs i Jardins&gt; Els Parcs&gt; Història&gt; La ciutat i el verd |publisher=Bcn.es |accessdate=26 June 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003183148/http://www.bcn.es/parcsijardins/cat/parcs/pa_his_ciu.htm|archivedate=3 October 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a proportion of {{convert|18.1|m2|sqft|0}} of park area per inhabitant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Parcs i Jardins, Institut Municipal|url=http://www.bcn.es/parcsijardins/cat/parcs/pa_his_demo.htm |title=Parcs i Jardins&gt; Els Parcs&gt; Història&gt; La democràcia |publisher=Bcn.es |accessdate=26 June 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331111427/http://www.bcn.es/parcsijardins/cat/parcs/pa_his_demo.htm|archivedate=31 March 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of Barcelona's parks, [[Montjuïc]] is the largest, with 203&amp;nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]] located on the mountain of the same name.&lt;ref name="guies_estadistiques"/&gt; It is followed by [[Parc de la Ciutadella]] (which occupies the site of the old military [[citadel]] and which houses the [[Parliament of Catalonia|Parliament]] building, the [[Barcelona Zoo]], and several museums); {{convert|31|ha|acre|1|disp=or|abbr=on}} including the zoo), the [[Guinardó Park]] ({{convert|19|ha|acre|1|disp=or|abbr=on}}), [[Park Güell]] (designed by [[Antoni Gaudí]]; {{convert|17.2|ha|acre|1|disp=or|abbr=on}}), [[Oreneta Castle Park]] (also {{convert|17.2|ha|acre|1|disp=or|abbr=on}}), [[Diagonal Mar Park]] ({{convert|13.3|ha|acre|1|disp=or|abbr=on}}, inaugurated in 2002), [[Nou Barris Central Park]] ({{convert|13.2|ha|acre|1|disp=or|abbr=on}}), [[Can Dragó Sports Park]] and [[Poblenou Park]] (both {{convert|11.9|ha|acre|1|disp=or|abbr=on}}), the [[Parc del Laberint d'Horta|Labyrinth Park]] ({{convert|9.10|ha|acre|1|disp=or|abbr=on}}), named after the garden maze it contains.&lt;ref name="guies_estadistiques"/&gt; There are also several smaller parks, for example, the [[Parc de Les Aigües]] ({{convert|2|ha|acre|1|disp=or|abbr=on}}). A part of the Collserola Park is also within the city limits. [[PortAventura World]], one of the largest resort in Europe, with 5,837,509 visitors per year, is located one hour's drive from Barcelona.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investindustrial.com/dam/Investindustrial/Social-responsibility/Portoflio-Companies-CSR-Reports/PortAventura-2017-Corporate-Social-Responsibility-Report/PortAventura%202017%20Corporate%20Social%20Responsibility%20Report.pdf Corporate responsibility report 2017] – [http://www.investindustrial.com/ investindustrial.com], 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teaconnect.org/sites/default/files/misc/files/2009report.pdf The Global Attractions Attendance Report] – [[Themed Entertainment Association]], 2009 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319052819/http://www.teaconnect.org/sites/default/files/misc/files/2009report.pdf |date=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, within the city lies [[Tibidabo Amusement Park]], a smaller amusement park in Plaza del Tibidabo, with the [[Muntanya Russa (Tibidabo Amusement Park)|Muntanya Russa]] amusement ride.

===Beaches===
[[File:Platges de Barcelona.svg|right|thumb|upright= 2.5|Beaches of Barcelona]]
Barcelona beach was listed as number one in a list of the top ten city beaches in the world according to ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]''&lt;ref name="NationalGeographic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/top-10/beach-cities-photos/#/beach-barcelona-spain_21757_600x450.jpg|title=Top 10 Beach Cities|accessdate=30 July 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100721215624/http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/top-10/beach-cities-photos/| archivedate= 21 July 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Discovery Channel]]''.&lt;ref name="DiscoveryChannel"&gt;Movie "Worlds Best Beaches", Discovery Channel 2005 {{YouTube|8bdvj5gubnA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barcelona contains seven beaches, totalling {{convert|4.5|km|mi|abbr=off}} of coastline. [[Sant Sebastià]], [[La Barceloneta, Barcelona|Barceloneta]] and [[Somorrostro]] beaches, both {{convert|1100|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} in length,&lt;ref name="guies_estadistiques"/&gt; are the largest, oldest and the most-frequented beaches in Barcelona.

The [[Olympic Harbour]] separates them from the other city beaches: Nova Icària, Bogatell, Mar Bella, Nova Mar Bella and Llevant. These beaches (ranging from {{convert|400|to|640|m|ft|abbr=on}} were opened as a result of the city restructuring to host the [[1992 Summer Olympics]], when a great number of industrial buildings were demolished. At present, the beach sand is artificially replenished given that storms regularly remove large quantities of material. The [[2004 Universal Forum of Cultures]] left the city a large concrete bathing zone on the eastmost part of the city's coastline. Most recently, Llevant is the first beach to allow dogs access during summer season.

* '''929''' (''Enchō 7, 8th month''): Floods devastated the country and many perished.&lt;ref name="t134"&gt;Titsingh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=18oNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=nipon+o+dai+itsi+ran#PRA1-PA134,M1  p. 134.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''July 24, 930''' (''Enchō 8, 26th day of the 6th month'')&lt;!-- NengoCalc 延長八年六月二十六日  --&gt;: A huge black storm cloud traveled from the slopes of Mt. Atago to Heian-kyo accompanied by frightful thunder. Lightning struck the Imperial Palace. Both Senior Counselor Fuijwara-no Kiyotsura (also known as Miyoshi no Kiyoyuki) and Middle Controller of the Right Taira-no Mareyo and many other subaltern officers were killed and their bodies were consumed in the subsequent fires. The deaths were construed as an act of revenge by the unsettled spirit of the late [[Sugawara no Michizane]].&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=18oNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=nipon+o+dai+itsi+ran#PRA1-PA134,M1  p. 134;] Brown, p. 293; Varley, p. 179–181.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''October 16, 930''' (''Enchō 8, 22nd day of the 9th month'')&lt;!-- NengoCalc 延長八年九月二十二日  --&gt;: In the 34th year of Daigo''-tennō'' 's reign (醍醐天皇34年), the emperor fell ill; and, fearing that he might not survive, Daigo abdicated. At this point, the succession (''senso'') was said to have been received by his son. Shortly thereafter, Emperor Suzaku is said to have acceded to the throne (''sokui'').&lt;ref&gt;Brown, p. 293; Varley, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''October 23, 930''' (''Enchō 8, 29th day of the 9th month'')&lt;!-- NengoCalc  延長八年九月二十九日 --&gt;: Emperor Daigo entered the Buddhist priesthood in the very early morning hours. As a monk, he took the Buddhist name Hō-kongō; and shortly thereafter, this humble monk died at the age of 46.&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=18oNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=nipon+o+dai+itsi+ran#PRA1-PA134,M1  p. 134;] Brown, p. 292.&lt;/ref&gt; This monk was buried in the precincts of [[Daigo-ji]], which is why the former-emperor's posthumous name became Daigo''-tennō''.&lt;ref name="t134"/&gt;

The '''epact''' (Latin ''epactae'', from Greek: ''epaktai hèmerai'' = added days) used to be described by medieval [[Computus|computists]] as the age of the Moon in days on 22 March;&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation | author = Bede the Venerable | author-link = Bede | translator-last = Wallis | translator-first = Faith | title = The Reckoning of Time | chapter = Lunar Epacts | series = Translated Texts for Historians | volume = 29 | publisher = Liverpool University Press | place = Liverpool | date = 1999  | origyear = 725 | page = 131 | isbn = 0-85323-693-3 | quote = The epacts noted in the 19-year cycle specifically stand for the age of the moon on the 11th kalends of April [22 March], the beginning of the Paschal feast.}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the newer [[Gregorian calendar]], however, the epact is  reckoned as the age of the ecclesiastical moon on 1 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation | last = Richards | first = E.

It varies (usually by 11 days) from year to year, because of the difference between the solar year of 365–366 days and the lunar year of 354–355 days.&lt;ref&gt;[http://henk-reints.nl/cal/audette/canon2.html Latin text and French translation of the Second Canon of the Gregorian calendar]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lunar calendar==

Epacts can also be used to relate dates in the lunar calendar to dates in the common solar calendar.

===Solar and lunar years===

A (solar) calendar year has 365 days (366 days in [[leap year]]s).  A lunar year has 12 lunar months which alternate between 30 and 29 days (in leap years, one of the lunar months has a day added).

If a solar and lunar year start on the same day, then after one year, the start of the solar year is 11 days after the start of the lunar year; after two years, it is 22 days after.  These excess days are epacts, and are added to the day of the solar year to determine the day of the lunar year.

Whenever the epact reaches or exceeds 30, an extra (embolismic or [[intercalary month|intercalary]]) month is inserted into the lunar calendar, and the epact is reduced by 30.

Leap days extend both the solar and lunar year, so they do not affect epact calculations for any other dates.

===19-year cycle===
The [[tropical year]] is about 365¼ days, while the [[synodic month]] is slightly longer than 29½ days, on average; both are non-integers.  This gets corrected in the following way.  Nineteen tropical years are as long as 235 synodic months ([[Metonic cycle]]).  A cycle can last 6939 or 6940 full days, depending on whether there are 4 or 5 leap days in this 19-year period.

After 19 years the lunations should fall the same way in the solar years, so the epact should repeat after 19 years.  However, 19 × 11 = 209, and this is not an integer multiple of the full cycle of 30 epact numbers (209 [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] 30 = 29, not 0).  So after 19 years the epact must be corrected by +1 in order for the cycle to repeat over 19 years.  This is the  ''saltus lunae'' (leap of the moon).  The sequence number of the year in the 19-year cycle is called the [[Golden numbers|Golden Number]].  The extra 209 days fill 7 embolismic months, for a total of 19×12 + 7 = 235 lunations.

===Lilian (Gregorian) epacts===
When the [[Gregorian calendar]] reform was [[#refpbull|instituted in 1582]], the lunar cycle previously used with the Julian calendar to complete the calculation of Easter dates was adjusted also, in accordance with a (modification of a) scheme devised by [[Aloysius Lilius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation | editor-last = Coyne | editor-first = George V. | editor-link = George V. Coyne | editor2-last = Hoskin | editor2-first = Michael A. | editor3-last = Pedersen | editor3-first = Olaf | editor3-link = Olaf Pedersen | date = 1983 | title = Gregorian Reform of the Calendar: Proceedings of the Vatican Conference to commemorate its 400th Anniversary, 1582-1982 | publisher = Pontifical Academy of Sciences, Vatican Observatory | place = Vatican City | url = http://www.casinapioiv.va/content/dam/accademia/pdf/es3.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; There were two adjustments of the old lunar cycle:
* a "solar equation", decrementing the epact by 1, whenever the Gregorian calendar drops a leap day (3 times in 400 calendar years), and
* a "lunar equation", incrementing the epact by 1, 8 times in 2500 calendar years (seven times after an interval of 300 years, and the eighth time after an interval of 400 years).

The "solar equation" would adjust for the Gregorian change in the solar calendar, if they were applied at 1 January of the Julian calendar instead of the Gregorian calendar as the reformers implemented it; moreover the corrections to the solar calendar are leap days, whereas there are 30 epact values for a mean lunar month of 29.5 days and a bit: therefore changing the epact by one does not exactly compensate for a dropped leap day. The "lunar equation" adjusts approximately for what had (by 1582) become the experience of many centuries, that the Moon moves a little faster than the expectation of its rate embodied in the old lunar cycle.  By 1582 it was noted (e.g. in the text of the bull [[Inter gravissimas]] itself) that the new and full moons were occurring "four days and something more" sooner than the old lunar cycle had been indicating.

== History ==

The discovery of the epact for computing the date of Easter has been attributed to [[Patriarch of Alexandria|Patriarch]] [[Pope Demetrius I of Alexandria|Demetrius I of Alexandria]], who held office from 189 to 232.  In the year 214 he used the epact to produce an Easter calendar, which has not survived, which used an eight-year [[Lunisolar calendar|luni-solar cycle]].&lt;ref name = Mosshammer&gt;{{ Citation | last = Mosshammer | first = Alden A. | date = 2008 | title = The Easter Computus and the Origins of the Christian Era | chapter = The 8-year Cycle and the Invention of the Epacts | publisher = Oxford University Press  | place = Oxford | series = Oxford Early Christian Studies | pages = 109–125 | isbn = 978-0-19-954312-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   A subsequent application of the epact to an Easter calendar, using a sixteen-year cycle, is found in the Paschal Table of Hipoolytus, a 112-year list of Easter dates beginning in the year 222 which is inscribed on the side of a statue found in Rome.&lt;ref name = Mosshammer/&gt; Augustalis, whose dates have been disputed from the third to the fifth century,&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation | last = Mosshammer | first = Alden A. | date = 2008 | title = The Easter Computus and the Origins of the Christian Era | publisher = Oxford University Press  | place = Oxford | series = Oxford Early Christian Studies | pages = 224–228 | isbn = 978-0-19-954312-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; computed a ''laterculus'' (little tablet) of Easter dates.  As reconstructed, it uses epacts (here the age of the moon on 1 January) and an 84-year luni-solar cycle to compute the dates of Easter using a base date of A.D. 213.  If we accept Augustalis's earlier dates, his ''laterculus'' extends from 213 to 312 and Augustalis originated the use of epacts to compute the date of Easter.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation | last = Pedersen | first = Olaf | author-link = Olaf Pedersen | editor-last = Coyne | editor-first = George V. | editor-link = George V. Coyne | editor2-last = Hoskin | editor2-first = Michael A. | editor3-last = Pedersen | editor3-first = Olaf | editor3-link = Olaf Pedersen | date = 1983 | title = Gregorian Reform of the Calendar: Proceedings of the Vatican Conference to commemorate its 400th Anniversary, 1582-1982 | chapter = The Ecclesiastical Calendar and the Life of the Church | pages = 39–40 | publisher = Pontifical Academy of Sciences, Vatican Observatory | place = Vatican City | url = http://www.casinapioiv.va/content/dam/accademia/pdf/es3.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as the fourth century. we see Easter [[computus]] using the epact and the nineteen-year [[Metonic cycle]] in Alexandria, and subsequent computistical tables were influenced by the structure of the [[Alexandrian calendar]].  The epact was taken as the age of the Moon on 26 Phamenoth (22 March in the Julian calendar) but that value of the epact also corresponded to the age of the Moon on the last [[epagomenal day]] of the preceding year.  Thus the epact can be seen as having been established at the beginning of the current year.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation | last = Mosshammer | first = Alden A. | date = 2008 | title = The Easter Computus and the Origins of the Christian Era | publisher = Oxford University Press  | place = Oxford | series = Oxford Early Christian Studies | pages = 75–80 | isbn = 978-0-19-954312-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequent Easter tables, such as those of Bishop [[Pope Theophilus of Alexandria|Theophilus or Alexandria]], which covered 100 years beginning in A.D. 380, and of his successor Bishop [[Cyril of Alexandria|Cyril]], which covered 95 years beginning in A.D. 437 discussed the computation of the epact in their introductory texts.  Under the influence of [[Dionysius Exiguus]] and later, of [[Bede]], the Alexandrian Easter Tables were adopted throughout Europe where they established the tradition that the epact was the age of the Moon on 22 March.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation | last = Pedersen | first = Olaf | author-link = Olaf Pedersen | editor-last = Coyne | editor-first = George V. | editor-link = George V.

Two factors led to the creation of three new forms of the epact in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.  The first was the increasing error of computistical techniques, which led to the introduction of a new Julian epact around 1478, to be used for practical computations of the phase of the Moon for medical or astrological purposes.  With the [[Gregorian reform of the calendar]] in 1582, two additional epacts came into use.  The first was the Lillian epact, developed by [[Aloisius Lilius]] as an element of the ecclesiastical computations using the Gregorian calendar.  The Lillian epact included corrections for the motions of the Sun and the Moon that broke the fixed relationship between the epact and the golden number.  The second new epact was a simple adjustment of the practical Julian epact to account for the ten-day change produced by the Gregorian Calendar.&lt;ref name = Dekker/&gt;

'''Fur clothing''' is [[clothing]] made of [[fur]]ry animal [[hide (skin)|hides]]. Fur is one of the oldest forms of clothing, and is thought to have been widely used as hominids first expanded outside Africa. Some view fur as luxurious and warm; however, others reject it due to moral concerns for [[animal rights]]. The term 'fur' is often used to refer to a coat, wrap, or shawl made from the fur of animals. Controversy exists regarding the wearing of fur coats, due to animal cruelty concerns. The most popular kinds of fur in the 1960s (known as the luxury fur) were blond mink, silver striped fox and red fox. These were mainly bought by the rich. Those who could not afford this wore pelts of wolf, Persian lamb or muskrat. It was common for ladies to wear a matching hat. However, in the 1950s, a 'must have' type of fur was the mutation fur (naturally nuanced colours) and fur trimmings on a coat that were beaver, lamb fur, Astrakhan and mink. To this day, some people consider fur as a trend and wear it.

Fur is generally thought to have been among the first materials used for clothing and bodily decoration. The exact date when fur was first used in [[clothes|clothing]] is debated. It is known that several species of [[hominoids]] including ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' and ''[[Homo neanderthalensis]]'' used fur clothing.

Fur is still worn in most mild and cool climates around the world due to its superior warmth and durability.  From the days of early European settlement, up until the development of modern clothing alternatives, fur clothing was popular in Canada during the cold winters.  The invention of inexpensive synthetic textiles for insulating clothing led to fur clothing falling out of [[fashion]].

Fur is still used by [[indigenous people]] and developed societies, due to its availability and superior [[Thermal insulation|insulation]] properties. The [[Inuit]] peoples of the Arctic relied on fur for most of their clothing, and it also forms a part of traditional clothing in [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Yugoslavia]], [[Scandinavia]], and [[Japan]].

It is also sometimes associated with glamour and lavish spending. A number of consumers and designers—notably British fashion designer and outspoken animal rights activist [[Stella McCartney]]—reject fur due to moral beliefs and perceived [[cruelty to animals]].&lt;ref name="Humane Society of the United States"&gt;[http://www.hsus.org/furfree/fashion/retailers/furfree_retailers_designers.html "Fur-Free Designers and Retailers"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126045059/http://www.hsus.org/furfree/fashion/retailers/furfree_retailers_designers.html |date=2009-11-26 }} July 31, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Animal furs used in garments and trim may be dyed bright colors or with patterns, often to mimic exotic animal pelts: alternatively they may be left their original pattern and color. Fur may be shorn down to imitate the feel of [[velvet]], creating a fabric called [[shearling]].

Common animal sources for fur clothing and fur trimmed accessories include [[fox]], [[Rabbit#Rabbits as food and clothing|rabbit]], [[mink]], [[raccoon dog]]s, [[muskrat]], [[beaver]], [[stoat]] (ermine), [[otter]], [[sable]], [[Pinniped|seal]]s, [[cat]]s, [[dog]]s, [[coyote]]s, [[wolf|wolves]], [[chinchilla]], and [[opossum]] and [[common brushtail possum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/bizfocus/archives/2008/12/21/2003431724 |title=New Zealand turns a pest into luxury business |publisher=Taipeitimes.com |date=2011-12-28 |accessdate=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these are more highly prized than others, and there are many grades and colors.

In Europe and Asia, cheap and plentiful dog and cat fur is sold under different names to disguise the origin from shoppers in the [[United States]], such as dog fur being labeled "Mongolian Wolf".&lt;ref name="Dawn"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dawn |first=Karen |authorlink=Karen Dawn |title=Thanking the Monkey: Rethinking the Way we Treat Animals |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pt7ZirPwG1sC |accessdate=12 March 2013 |edition=1st |year=2008 |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |location=[[New York City]] |isbn=978-0-06-135185-3 |pages=109–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study by the [[Humane Society of the United States]], all twenty-five fur trim coats from twenty different retailers were found to be mislabeled, usually in the case of fur from an animal that it is illegal to kill for fur being labeled as a legal animal.&lt;ref name="Dawn"/&gt; One example of this was a coat being labeled as having fur from a [[raccoon]], although DNA testing proved that the fur came from a [[raccoon dog]].&lt;ref name="Dawn"/&gt;

==Processing of fur==
[[File:Nutukkaat.JPG|thumb|right|Traditional [[Sami people|Sami]] fur [[footwear]]]]
The manufacturing of fur clothing involves obtaining animal pelts where the hair is left on. Depending on the type of fur and its purpose, some of the chemicals involved in fur processing may include table salts, alum salts, acids, soda ash, sawdust, cornstarch, lanolin, degreasers and, less commonly, bleaches, dyes and toners (for dyed fur).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jos. H. Lowenstein &amp; Sons Inc. |url=http://www.jhlowenstein.com/fur/ |title=Fur Products |publisher=Jhlowenstein.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Workers exposed to fur dust created during fur processing have been shown to have reduced pulmonary function in direct proportion to their length of exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=14777753 |title=Pulmonary function in fur-processing workers: A dose-response relationship |publisher=Cat.inist.fr |date= |accessdate=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, [[leather]] made from any animal hide involves removing the fur from the skin and using only the tanned skin. However, the use of [[wool]] involves shearing the animal's hair from the living animal. [[Fake fur]] (or "faux fur") designates any [[Synthetic fiber|synthetic material]] that attempts to mimic the appearance and feel of real fur.

The chemical treatment of fur to increase its felting quality is known as carroting, as the process tends to turn the tips of the fur a carrot orange color. A furrier is a person who makes fur products such as fur garments, fur blankets etc. and repairs, alters, cleans, or otherwise deals in furs of animals.

==Anti-fur campaigns==
{{main|Fur farming}}

Anti-fur campaigns were popularized the 1980s and 1990s, with the participation of numerous celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.furcommission.com/news/newsF08z.htm |title=FICA sales stats |date=18 March 2006 |publisher= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060318113019/http://www.furcommission.com/news/newsF08z.htm |archivedate=18 March 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fur clothing has become the focus of boycotts on the opinion that it is cruel and unnecessary. [[PETA]] and other animal rights organizations, celebrities, and animal rights ethicists, have called attention to fur farming.

[[Animal rights]] advocates object to the trapping and killing of wildlife, and to the confinement and killing of animals on [[Fur farming|fur farms]] due to concerns about the animals suffering and death. They may also condemn "alternatives" made from synthetic (oil-based) clothing as they promote fur for the sake of fashion. Protests also include objection to the use of leather in clothing, shoes and accessories.

Some animal rights activists have disrupted fur fashion shows with protests, while other anti-fur protesters may use fashion shows featuring faux furs or other alternatives to fur clothing as a platform to highlight animal suffering from the use of real leathers and furs. These groups sponsor "Compassionate Fashion Day" on the third Saturday of August to promote their anti-fur message. Some American groups participate in "Fur Free Friday", an event held annually on the Friday after Thanksgiving ([[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]]) that uses displays, protests, and other methods to highlight their beliefs regarding furs.

In Canada, opposition to the annual [[seal hunt]] is viewed as an anti-fur issue, although the [[Humane Society of the United States]] claims that its opposition is to "the largest slaughter of marine mammals on Earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/seal_hunt/ |title=Seal Hunt : The Humane Society of the United States |date=16 June 2010 |publisher= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616040111/http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/seal_hunt/ |archivedate=16 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IFAW]], an anti-sealing group, claims that Canada has an "abysmal record of enforcement" of anti-cruelty laws surrounding the hunt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifaw.org/united-kingdom/our-work/seals/why-commercial-sealing-cruel|title=Why commercial sealing is cruel|website=IFAW - International Fund for Animal Welfare}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Canadian government survey&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/seal-phoque/reports-rapports/study-etude/study-etude_e.htm |title=Fisheries and Aquaculture Management - Seals and Sealing in Canada |date=12 May 2008 |publisher= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512014542/http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/seal-phoque/reports-rapports/study-etude/study-etude_e.htm |archivedate=12 May 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; indicated that two-thirds of Canadians supported the hunting of seals if the regulations under Canadian law are enforced.

Products from all marine mammals, even from non-threatened populations and regulated hunts, such as the Canadian seal hunt, are banned in the United States, with minor exceptions for [[Alaska Natives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/laws/mmpa/ |title=Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) of 1972 |publisher=Nmfs.noaa.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hieronymus Megiser''' (c.1554 in [[Stuttgart]] – 1618 or 1619 in [[Linz]], [[Austria]]) was a German polymath, linguist and historian.

==Career==
From 1571 he studied at the [[University of Tübingen]], and was a favourite student of the humanist and philologist [[Nicodemus Frischlin]]. In 1577 he graduated there with a master's degree. In 1581 he moved as a private tutor to [[Ljubljana]] (Laibach). From 1582 he studied jurisprudence in [[Padua]] and was then active as a private tutor of young noblemen from Croatia and Styria. In 1588/89 he travelled to Italy and [[Malta]], and in 1591 to North Germany, the Netherlands and England. In 1590/91 he was granted the title of "Ordinarius Historiographus" by Archduke Charles in [[Graz]]. In 1592, still in Graz, he published his [[Dictionarium quatuor linguarum]], the first multilingual dictionary of Slovene. He made the acquaintance of the young [[Johannes Kepler]], and remained in learned correspondence with him. After further travels he settled in [[Frankfurt am Main]] and married the daughter of the printer Johann Spiess.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/11879826X.html#indexcontent Johann Spieß] at Deutsche Biographie.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1593 until 1601 he was the Rector of the evangelical "Collegium sapientiae et pietatis" in [[Klagenfurt]], Carinthia. After returning to Frankfurt am Main he became Professor of History at the University of Leipzig. From 1610 the interest of the Upper Austrian dignitaries in history was so great that they required a historian to head up the provincial library, in a similar way to a court historian. Megiser was selected for this role in 1615, and was commissioned to write a chronicle of the province. In 1612 he published ''Annales Carinthiae'' or ''Chronica des Loeblichen Ertzhertzogthumbs Khaerndten'', which he signed as his own work, although it was mainly written by Carinthian pastor Michael Gothard Christalnick and only edited by Megiser on the request of the Carinthian Estates.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, Karl: Megiser, Christalnick und die Annales Carinthiae, Mitteilungen des Institus fuer Oesterreichische Geschichtsforschung 57, 1949, pg. 359-372.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21081">{{Taoism}}
The history of [[Taoism]] stretches throughout Chinese history. Originating in prehistoric China, it has exerted a powerful influence over Chinese culture throughout the ages. Taoism evolved in response to changing times, with its doctrine and associated practices being revised and refined. The acceptance of Taoism by the ruling class has waxed and waned, alternately enjoying periods of favor and rejection. Most recently, Taoism has emerged from a period of suppression and is undergoing a revival in China.

[[Laozi]] is traditionally regarded as the founder of Taoist religion and is closely associated in this context with "original", or "primordial", Taoism.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet 1997, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Whether he actually existed is disputed,&lt;ref name="Robinet 1997, p. 25"&gt;Robinet 1997, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; however, the work attributed to him - the Daodejing - is dated to the 4th or 3rd century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet 1997, p. xix&lt;/ref&gt; However, Taoism clearly predates Laozi (Lao Tzu) as he refers to "The Tao masters of antiquity" in Chapter 15 of the Daodejing ([[Tao Te Ching]]). Moreover, the '''[[Yellow Emperor]],''' Huangdi (2697–2597 BCE) Is often associated with origin of the Tao.

Sinologist Isabelle Robinet identifies four components in the emergence of Taoism:
#[[Taoism#Categorization|Philosophical Taoism]], i.e. the ''[[Daodejing]]'' and ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]''
#Techniques for achieving ecstasy
#Practices for achieving longevity or immortality
#Exorcism&lt;ref name="Robinet 1997, p. 25"/&gt;

Some elements of Taoism may be traced to [[prehistoric]] folk religions in China that later coalesced into a Taoist tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Demerath (2003), p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hucker (1995), pp. 203–04.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, many Taoist practices drew from the Warring-States-era phenomena of the [[Wu (shaman)]] (connected to the "shamanism" of Southern China) and the [[Fangshi]] (which probably derived from the "archivist-soothsayers of antiquity, one of whom supposedly was Laozi himself"), even though later Taoists insisted that this was not the case.&lt;ref name="Robinet 1997, p. 36"&gt;Robinet 1997, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Both terms were used to designate individuals dedicated to "... magic, medicine, divination,... methods of longevity and to ecstatic wanderings" as well as exorcism; in the case of the ''wu'', "shamans" or "sorcerers" is often used as a translation.&lt;ref name="Robinet 1997, p. 36"/&gt; The ''fangshi'' were philosophically close to the [[School of Naturalists|School of Yin-Yang]], and relied much on astrological and calendrical speculations in their divinatory activities.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet 1997, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

==Han Dynasty (206 BCE&amp;ndash;220 CE)==
The term ''Daojia'' (usually translated as "philosophical Taoism") was coined during the [[Han Dynasty]]. In [[Sima Qian]]'s history (chapter 63) it refers to immortals; in Liu Xiang it refers to Laozi and Zhuangzi (''Daojiao'' came to be applied to the religious movements in later times). The earliest commentary on the ''Dao De Jing'' is that of [[Heshang Gong]] (the "Riverside Master"), a legendary figure depicted as a teacher to the Han emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn (2000), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early Han Dynasty, the Tao came to be associated with or conflated with the [[Emperor Xian of Han|Xian Di Emperor]]. A major text from the [[Huang-Lao]] movement would be the ''[[Huainanzi]]'', which interprets earlier works of the Taoist canon in light of the quest for immortality.

The first organized form of Taoism, the [[Tianshi Dao|Tianshi]] (Celestial Masters') school (later known as [[Zhengyi Dao|Zhengyi]] school), developed from the [[Five Pecks of Rice]] movement at the end of the 2nd century CE; the latter had been founded by [[Zhang Daoling]], who claimed that Laozi appeared to him in the year 142.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet 1997, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; The Tianshi school was officially recognized by ruler [[Cao Cao]] in 215, legitimizing Cao Cao's rise to power in return.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet 1997, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Laozi received imperial recognition as a divinity in the mid-2nd century.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet (1997), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Celestial Masters' activities did hasten the downfall of the Han Dynasty, largely because Zhang's grandson set up a theocratic state into what is now [[Sichuan]] province. The same could be said of their contemporaries, the Taoist-leaning [[Yellow Turban]] sect.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet (1997), p. 54-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Three Kingdoms Period (220&amp;ndash;265)==
During the [[Three Kingdoms Period]], the [[Xuanxue]] (Mysterious Wisdom) school, including [[Wang Bi]], focused on the texts of Laozi and Zhuangzi. Many of the school's members, including Wang Bi himself, were not religious in any sense.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet (1997), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Wang Bi mostly focused on reconciling Confucian thought with Taoist thought. Because the version of the Tao Te Ching that has been passed on to the present is the one that Wang Bi commented upon, his interpretations became very influential as they were passed on alongside the Tao Te Ching. In addition, his commentary was compatible with Confucian ideas and Buddhist ideas that later entered China. This compatibility ensured Taoism would remain an important aspect of Chinese culture, and made the merging of the three religions easier in later periods, such as the Tang dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/w/wangbi.htm Wang Bi [Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy&amp;#93;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Six Dynasties (316&amp;ndash;589)==
Taoist alchemist [[Ge Hong]], also known as [[Baopuzi]] (抱扑子 The "Master Embracing Simplicity") was active in the third and fourth centuries and had great influence on later Taoism.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet (1997), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Major scriptures were produced during this time period, including The [[Shangqing School|Shangqing]] (上清 "Supreme Clarity") (365&amp;ndash;370) and [[Lingbao School|Lingbao]] (靈寶 "Sacred Treasure") scriptures (397&amp;ndash;402) received at Maoshan. The Shangqing revelations were received by Yang Xi, a relative of Ge Hong's; the revelations emphasised meditative visualisation (內觀 ''neiguan''). They spoke of the Shangqing heaven, which stood above what had been previously considered the highest heaven by Celestial Master Taoists. Yang Xi's revelations consisted of visitations from the residents of this heaven (the "[[Zhenren]]") many of whom were ancestors of a circle of aristocrats from southern China. These Zhenren spoke of an apocalypse which was to arrive in 384, and claimed that only certain people from this aristocratic circle had been chosen to be saved. For the first century of its existence, Shangqing Taoism was isolated to this aristocratic circle. However, [[Tao Hongjing]] (456&amp;ndash;536) codified and wrote commentaries on Yang Xi's writings and allowed for the creation of Shangqing Taoism as a popular religion.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet (1997), p. 116-117.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lingbao scriptures added some Buddhist elements such as an emphasis on universal salvation.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet (1997), p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also during the [[Six Dynasties]] period, the Celestial Master movement re-emerged in two distinct forms. [[The Northern Celestial Masters]] were founded in 424 century by [[Kou Qianzhi]], and a Taoist theocracy was established that lasted until 450 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn (2000), p. 284-285.&lt;/ref&gt; After this time, the Northern Celestial Masters were expelled from the Wei court and re-established themselves at Louguan where they survived into the [[Tang Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Kohn (2000), p. 284-289-290.&lt;/ref&gt; The Southern Celestial Masters were centered at Jiankang (modern-day [[Nanjing]], and were likely made of those adherents who fled Sichuan and others who fled from [[Luoyang]] after its fall in 311 CE. These various followers of The Way of the Celestial Master coalesced to form a distinct form of Taoism known as the Southern Celestial Masters, who lasted as a distinct movement into the fifth century.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn (2000), p. 257-258.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tang Dynasty (618&amp;ndash;907)==
Taoism gained official status in China during the Tang Dynasty, whose emperors claimed Laozi as their relative.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet (1997), p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was forced to compete with [[Confucianism]] and [[Buddhism]], its major rivals, for patronage and rank. Emperor [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Xuanzong]] (685&amp;ndash;762), who ruled at the height of the Tang, wrote commentaries on texts from all three of these traditions, which exemplifies the fact that in many people's lives they were not mutually exclusive. This marks the beginning of a long-lived tendency within imperial China, in which the government supported (and simultaneously regulated) all three movements.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet (1997), p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Emperor Gaozong of Tang|Gaozong Emperor]] added the ''Tao Te Ching'' to the list of classics (''jing,'' 經) to be studied for the imperial examinations.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet (1997), p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Song Dynasty (960&amp;ndash;1279)==
Several Song emperors, most notably [[Emperor Huizong (Song Dynasty)|Huizong]], were active in promoting Taoism, collecting Taoist texts and publishing editions of the ''[[Daozang]].''&lt;ref&gt;Robinet (1997), p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Quanzhen]] school of Taoism was founded during this period, and together with the resurgent Celestial Masters called the [[Zhengyi Dao|Zhengyi]] is one of the two schools of Taoism that have survived to the present.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn (2000), p. 567.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Song Dynasty]] saw an increasingly complex interaction between the elite traditions of organised Taoism as practised by ordained Taoist ministers (''daoshi'') and the local traditions of [[folk religion]] as practised by spirit mediums (''wu'') and a new class of non-ordained ritual experts known as ''fashi''.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn (2000), p. 415.&lt;/ref&gt; This interaction manifested itself in the integration of 'converted' local deities into the bureaucratically organised Taoist pantheon and the emergence of new exorcistic rituals, including the [[Celestial Heart Rites]] and the [[Thunder Rites]].&lt;ref&gt;Kohn (2000), p. 416-418, 423&lt;/ref&gt;

Aspects of Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism were consciously synthesised in the [[Neo-Confucian]] school, which eventually became Imperial [[orthodoxy]] for state bureaucratic purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn (2000), p. XVII.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yuan Dynasty (1279&amp;ndash;1367)==
[[File:Baiyun.jpg|thumb|500px|White Cloud Monastery in Beijing]]
Taoism suffered a significant setback in 1281 when many copies of the ''Daozang'' were ordered burned. This destruction gave Taoism a chance to renew itself.&lt;ref&gt;Schipper and Verellen (2004), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Neidan]]'', a form of [[internal alchemy]], became a major emphasis of the Quanzhen sect, whose practitioners followed a monastic model inspired by Buddhism. One of its leaders, Qiu Chuji became a teacher of [[Genghis Khan]] before the establishment of the [[Yuan Dynasty]]. (and used his influence to save millions of lives). Originally from [[Shanxi]] and [[Shandong]], the sect established its main center in [[Beijing]]'s [[White Cloud Temple|Baiyunguan]] ("White Cloud Monastery").&lt;ref&gt;Robinet (1997), p. 223-224.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the end of the dynasty, the Celestial Masters sect (and Buddhism) again gained preeminence.&lt;ref&gt;Schipper (1993), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ming Dynasty (1368&amp;ndash;1644)==
In 1406, [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] emperor [[Zhu Di]] commanded that all Taoist texts be collected and combined into a new version of the ''Daozang.'' The text was finally finished in 1447, and took nearly forty years to complete.&lt;ref&gt;Schipper and Verellen (2004), p. 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Qing Dynasty (1644&amp;ndash;1912)==
The fall of the Ming Dynasty and the subsequent establishment of the [[Qing Dynasty]] by the Manchus was blamed by some literati on religion, specifically Taoism. They sought to regain power by advocating a return to [[Confucianism|Confucian]] orthodoxy in a movement called ''Hanxue'', or "[[Han Learning]]." This movement returned the Confucian classics to favor and nearly completely rejected Taoism. During the eighteenth century, the [[Siku Quanshu|imperial library]] was constituted, but excluded virtually all Taoist books.&lt;ref&gt;Schipper (1993), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; By the beginning of the twentieth century, Taoism had fallen much from favor (only one complete copy of the ''[[Daozang]]'' still remained, at the White Cloud Monastery in Beijing).&lt;ref&gt;Schipper (1993), p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nationalist Period (1912&amp;ndash;1949)==
[[Guomindang]] (Chinese Nationalist Party) leaders embraced science, modernity, and Western culture, including (to some extent) Christianity. Viewing the popular religion as reactionary and parasitic, they confiscated some temples for public buildings, and otherwise attempted to control traditional religious activity.&lt;ref&gt;Schipper (1993), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==People's Republic of China (1949&amp;ndash;present)==
The [[Communist Party of China]], officially atheistic, initially suppressed Taoism along with other religions. During the [[Cultural Revolution]] from 1966 to 1976, many Taoist temples and sites were damaged and Monks and priests were sent to labor camps.&lt;ref name="Dean 1993, p. 41"&gt;Dean (1993), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Persecution of Taoists stopped in 1979, and many Taoists began reviving their traditions.&lt;ref name="Dean 1993, p. 41"&gt;Dean (1993), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, many temples and monasteries have been repaired and reopened.

Taoism is one of five religions recognized by the PRC, which regulates its activities through the China Taoist Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hrwf.net/advocacy/ext/religious_freedom_china.pdf |title= Human Rights Without Frontiers "Religious Freedom in China in 2006" |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090327075017/http://www.hrwf.net/advocacy/ext/religious_freedom_china.pdf |archivedate= 2009-03-27 |df=  }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(30.6&amp;nbsp;KB)}} An address given to the Delegation EU-China of the European Parliament.&lt;/ref&gt; Sensitive areas include the relationship of the [[Zhengyi Dao|Zhengyi]] Taoists with their sect's lineage-holder, who lives in Taiwan, and various traditional temple activities such as astrology and shamanism, which have been criticized as "superstitious".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oslocoalition.org/html/project_china/report_china_visit_2000.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001211132/http://www.oslocoalition.org/html/project_china/report_china_visit_2000.html|archivedate=2007-10-01|title=Report from The Oslo Coalition "Visit to China"|accessdate=2007-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taoism in the West==
From 1927-1944, the chief proponent of Taoism in the West was Professor [[Henri Maspero]] in Paris. [[Michael Saso]] was the first westerner to be initiated as a Taoist priest; he subsequently served also as co-editor of ''Taoist Resources''. Today, many Taoist organizations have been established in the West.

"Popular Western Taoism" is a term coined by Jonathan R. Herman in his 1998 review of [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s ''[[Daodejing]]'' "rendition", referring to the
&lt;blockquote&gt;abundance of new literature on Taoism by nonspecialists, including "translations" of Taoist texts by authors who (sometimes boastfully) lack linguistic competence. Scholars have been quick to reject such documents as ahistorical and inauthentic, and many do indeed combine questionable scholarship with a promiscuous blend of western individualism and new-age universalism. However, this popular western Taoism is not exclusively or even primarily a scholarly phenomenon; rather, it is an ''aesthetic'', ''cultural'', and ''religious'' phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Herman, Jonathan R.. 1998. "Review of Tao Te Ching: A Book About the Way and the Power of the Way". ''Journal of the American Academy of Religion'' 66 (3). [Oxford University Press, American Academy of Religion]: 686–89. https://www.jstor.org/stable/1466152.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This review was largely positive with some criticisms and cautions. While Herman states that the book "is not a useful text for informing students" about philosophical thought during the Chinese [[Warring States period]],
Herman praised the book as a "surprisingly interesting and scholastically responsible" example of western Daoist thought and as "an intelligent example of the emerging western transformation of Taoism, an area too often overlooked by sinologists." On the other hand, he criticized that Le Guin "make[s] some claims—or rather, employs some language—that may carry misleading implications", such as identifying Laozi "as a mystic and his perceptions as mystical, without ever defining the terms or questioning what generalizations can be drawn."

Herman subsequently described popular Western Taoism as the modern proliferation of self-proclaimed Daoist journals, meditation centers, websites, and renderings of Daoist texts by nonspecialists; and said, "not surprisingly, the sinological community (myself included) has generally greeted this overall phenomenon – what I will from here on label "popular Western Daoism" – with varying degrees of indifferences, amusement, and derision."&lt;ref&gt;Herman, Jonathan R. (2001), "Daoist Environmentalism in the West: Ursula K. Le Guin's Reception and Transmission of Daoism," in ''Daoism and Ecology'', ed. by N. J. Girardot et al., Harvard University Press, 391, 392.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1998 article about teaching Daoism, Russell Kirkland urged colleagues not to "Pooh-pooh Taoism" with "popular fluff" like Benjamin Hoff's coffee-table book ''[[The Tao of Pooh]]'', and characterized [[Stephen Mitchell (translator)|Stephen Mitchell]] and others as "self-indulgent dilettantes who deceive the public by publishing pseudo-translations of the ''Tao-te ching'', without having actually read the text in its original language".&lt;ref&gt;Russell Kirkland, "Teaching Taoism in the 1990s", ''Teaching Theology and Religion'', 1998, 1.2, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis Komjathy described modern "Western Daoism" or "American Daoism" in [[religious studies]] terms, where "New Age discourse communities and advocates of Perennial Philosophy identify and interpret Daoist texts as part of a 'universal wisdom tradition'."&lt;ref&gt;Komjathy, Louis (2004), [http://www.daoistcenter.org/novareligio.pdf Tracing the Contours of Daoism in North America] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111226091433/http://www.daoistcenter.org/novareligio.pdf |date=2011-12-26 }}, ''Nova Religio: The Journal of Alternative and Emergent Religions'', 8.2, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Komjathy later elaborated on these spiritual hybrids that "domesticate, sterilize and misrepresent Daoism", and may best be understood as part of a [[new religious movement]] labeled "Popular Western Taoism (PWT), with 'Taoism' pronounced with a hard 't' sound."&lt;ref&gt;Komjathy, Louis (2010), [http://www.daoistcenter.org/pwt.html Popular Western Taoism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151211110432/http://www.daoistcenter.org/pwt.html |date=2015-12-11 }}, Center for Daoist Studies. This refers to the common {{IPA|/ˈtaʊ.ɪzəm/}} mispronunciation of English ''Taoism'' {{IPA|/ˈdaʊ.ɪzəm/}} (see [[Daoism–Taoism romanization issue]]).&lt;/ref&gt; In this construct, "'Daoism' becomes anything for anyone", and Popular Western Taoism "has little to no connection with the Daoist religious tradition."&lt;ref&gt;Komjathy, Louis (2010),  [http://www.daoistcenter.org/daoist3.html Popular Construction of Daoist Religion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125122245/http://www.daoistcenter.org/daoist3.html |date=2015-11-25 }} , Center for Daoist Studies.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3827">The '''history of the Jews in Khaybar''' flourished during the 7th century which is now located some 95 miles to the north of [[Medina]] (ancient Yathrib) in present-day [[Saudi Arabia]].

==Migration to Khaybar==
The first migration of Jews to Khaybar dates back, by some accounts, to the time of king David,&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Khaldūn, Kitāb al-ʻIbar wa-Dīwān al-Mubtadaʼ wa-l-Khabar fī Taʼrīkh al-ʻArab, Dar al-Fekr publishing house, Beirut, 1988, volume 2 page 342&lt;/ref&gt; others date it back to the time of Babylonian exile&lt;ref&gt;Jawad Ali, Al-Mufassal fi Tarikh al-Arab qabala al-Islam, Dar Al-Saqqi publishing house, 2001, volume 12 page 102&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Jewish settlers of Khaybar were the descendants of Shephatiah the son of Mahalalel from the tribe of Judah&lt;ref&gt;Jawad Ali, Al-Mufassal fi Tarikh al-Arab qabala al-Islam, Dar Al-Saqqi publishing house, 2001, volume 12 page 102&lt;/ref&gt; and some settlers were descendants of the Cohanim&lt;ref&gt;Ali bin Ebrahim Al-Halabi, Ensan Al-Uyyoun Fi Sirat Al-Amin Al-Mamoon, Dar Al-Kutub Al-Elmyia publishing house, Beirut, 1427, volume 2 page 288&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic activity==
The Jews of [[Khaybar]] pioneered the cultivation of the oasis and made their living growing date palm trees, as well as through commerce and craftsmanship, accumulating considerable wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Yāqut, ''Šihāb al-Dīn ibn ‘Abd Allah al-Ḥamawī al-Rūmī al-Baġdādī'' (ed. Ferdinand Wüstenfeld), Mu’jam al-Buldān, vol. IV, Leipzig 1866, p. 542 (reprint: Ṭaharān 1965, ''Maktabat al-Asadi''); Hayyim Zeev Hirschberg, ''Israel Ba-‘Arav'', Tel Aviv 1946, p. 343 (Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; Some objects found by the Muslims when they entered Khaybar—a siege-engine, 20 bales of Yemenite cloth, and 500 cloaks—point out to an intense trade carried out by the Jews. In the past some scholars attempted to explain the siege-engine by suggesting that it was used for settling quarrels among the families of the community. Today most academics believe it was stored in a depôt for future sale, in the same way that swords, lances, shields, and other weaponry had been sold by the Jews to Arabs. Equally, the cloth and the cloaks may have been intended for sale, as it was unlikely that such a quantity of luxury goods were kept for the exclusive use of the Jews. However, these commercial activities led to some resentment that is similar to the economic causes that were behind persecutions in many other countries throughout history.&lt;ref name="Vaglieri"&gt;Veccia Vaglieri, L. "Khaybar", Encyclopaedia of Islam&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expulsion of the Jews from Khaybar==
During the reign of Caliph [[Umar]] (634–644), the [[Jewish]] community of Khaybar were transported alongside the [[Christian]] community of [[Najran]] to the newly conquered regions of [[Syria]] and [[Iraq]]. As a settlement, Umar issued orders that these Christians and Jews should be treated well and allotted them land in their new settlements equivalent to they land they initially owned. However, Umar also forbade [[non-Muslim]]s to reside in the [[Hejaz]] for longer than three days.&lt;ref&gt;[[Giorgio Levi Della Vida]] and [[Michael Bonner]], ''Encyclopaedia of Islam'', and Madelung, ''The Succession to Prophet Muhammad'', p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the Jews of Khaybar traveled around many areas throughout the [[Caliphate|Islamic Empire]] as artisans and merchants and maintained a distinctive identity until the 12th century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6494">[[File:Cinecittà - Entrance.jpg|thumb|240px|The Italian studio complex [[Cinecittà]] where the films were made.]]
'''Hollywood on the Tiber''' is a phrase used to describe the period in the 1950s and 1960s when the Italian capital of [[Rome]] emerged as a major location for international [[filmmaking]] attracting a large number of foreign productions to the [[Cinecittà]] studios. By contrast to the native [[Cinema of Italy|Italian film industry]], these movies were made in [[English language|English]] for global release. Although the primary markets for such films were American and British audiences, they enjoyed widespread popularity in other countries, including Italy.

The commercial success of ''[[Quo Vadis (1951 film)|Quo Vadis]]'' (1951) led to a stream of [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbusters]] produced in Italy by [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood studios]], which reached its height with [[20th Century Fox]]'s ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]'' in 1963. The phrase "Hollywood on Tiber", a reference to the [[Tiber|river that runs through Rome]], was coined in 1950 by ''[[Time Magazine]]'' during the making of ''Quo Vadis''.&lt;ref&gt;Wrigley p.52&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Background==
Following [[World War II]], Hollywood studios increasingly shifted production abroad both to take advantage of lower costs and to use frozen funds (profits from American films which foreign governments barred from export). These films, known as [[runaway productions]], could also benefit from local [[subsidies]]. By the early 1950s, some of the largest-budget American films were being shot in European countries, particularly in Britain and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Balio p.228&lt;/ref&gt; In both countries newly arrived American companies worked alongside continuing large-scale domestic film industries.

In Italy, the film-makers used the vast Cinecittà complex which had been built in the 1930s by [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Fascist]] regime which was aiming to rebuild Italian cinema. Following Mussolini's overthrow in 1943, production at Cinecittà was suspended and no new films were made until 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Gundle p.261&lt;/ref&gt;

==Height==
[[File:0 Tibre - Pont Vittorio Emanuele II - San Spirito in Sassia - St-Pierre (Vatican).jpg|thumb|240px|The expression refers to the [[Tiber]] which runs through Rome.]]
Although American companies had shot in Italy before (such as [[Fox Film Corporation|Fox]]'s 1922 silent ''[[Nero (1922 film)|Nero]]'' and [[MGM]]'s 1925 ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1925 film)|Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ]]''), the scale of the post-war investment was unprecedented. Many of the films were [[sword and sandal]] epics, often set in [[Ancient Rome]] which required large [[film set]]s and [[location filming]]. Other films included contemporary-set romances ''[[Roman Holiday]]'' (1953) and ''[[Three Coins in the Fountain (film)|Three Coins in the Fountain]]'' (1954).&lt;ref&gt;Balio p.228&lt;/ref&gt; The companies imported actors from a variety of countries (particularly Britain and the United States), who appeared alongside Italians who generally played smaller, supporting roles or [[film extra|extras]]. [[Sophia Loren]] was a notable Italian star with sufficient international appeal to be cast in a [[leading role]].

In 1962, the lengthy and troubled production of ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]'' brought further media attention to the city. The delays led to a spiraling budget, making it the most expensive film ever made at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Bondanella p.161&lt;/ref&gt;

Far from leading to a decline in Italian cinema, the native industry boomed during the era. In 1960, Italian films outperformed American imports to Italy for the first time since 1946.&lt;ref&gt;McElhaney p.146&lt;/ref&gt; However, there was a growing influence of Hollywood-style productions, as popular Italian genres such as the [[Peplum (film genre)|Sword-and-sandal]] and [[Spaghetti Western]] attempted to imitate successful Hollywood productions. Italian actors and directors often adopted [[English people|English]]-sounding names.&lt;ref&gt;Bondanella p.339&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
Cinecittà was at the peak of its international fame between the production of ''Ben Hur'' and ''Cleopatra'' (1958-1960).&lt;ref&gt;Torriglia p.60&lt;/ref&gt; As the 1960s drew on, the fashion for classical epics began to decline following the commercial failure of ''[[The Fall of the Roman Empire (film)|The Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' (1964), although films in other genres such as [[David Lean]]'s ''[[Doctor Zhivago (film)|Doctor Zhivago]]'' (1965) continued to be profitable. 

In 2009 a documentary film ''[[Hollywood on the Tiber (film)|Hollywood on the Tiber]]'' was released. It portrays Cinecittà  and the various stars who worked there between 1950 and 1970.

{{Islam|history}}
'''Islam and modernity''' is a topic of discussion in contemporary [[sociology of religion]]. The [[history of Islam]] chronicles different interpretations and approaches.  [[Modernity]] is a complex and multidimensional phenomenon rather than a unified and coherent one.  It has historically had different schools of thought moving in many directions.&lt;ref&gt;''The Responsibilities of the Muslim Intellectual in the 21st Century'', [[Abdolkarim Soroush]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Industrial Revolution's impact on Islam ==

In the 18th century [[Europe]] was undergoing major transformations as the new ideas of [[the Enlightenment]], which stressed the importance of science, rationality, and human reason, and the new technologies of the [[Industrial Revolution]] swept across Europe, giving Europeans great power and influence. In the last quarter of the 18th century, the gap widened between the technical skills of some western and northern European countries and those of the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hourani | first1 = Albert | title = A History of the Arab Peoples | year = 1991 | pages = 259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of modern Europe coincided with what many scholars refer to as the decline of the [[Ottoman Empire]], which by the 18th century was facing political, military, and economic breakdown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Esposito | first1 = Jonh L. | title = Islam: The Straight Path | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2005 | pages = 115–116}}&lt;/ref&gt; While prior to the 18th century the Ottomans had regarded themselves to be either of superior or, by the mid-18th century, of equal strength to Europe, by the end of the 18th century the power relationship between the Ottoman Empire and Europe began to shift in Europe's favor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hourani | first1 = Albert | title = A History of the Arab Peoples | year = 1991 | pages = 258–259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===French occupation of the Ottoman Empire===
In 1798 [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s army occupied the Ottoman province of [[Egypt]] and killed roughly 3000 Egyptians. Although the occupation was only three years, followed by lingering hostility to the French, the experience ultimately exposed the Egyptian people to Enlightenment ideas and Europe's new technology.&lt;ref name="The Arabs: A History"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Rogan | first1 = Eugene | title = The Arabs: A History | publisher = Basic Books | year = 2009 | pages = 62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ottoman scholars in Europe===
The exposure to European power and ideas would later inspire the new governor of Egypt, [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]], to draw on this technology to modernize Egypt, setting an example for the rest of the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman government began to open [[embassies]] and send officials to study in Europe. This created conditions for the "gradual formation of a group of reformers with a certain knowledge of the modern world and a conviction that the empire must belong to it or perish".&lt;ref name="AH1983: 43"&gt;[[#AH1983|Albert, ''Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age'', 1983]]: p.43&lt;/ref&gt;
One of the scholars sent by Muhammad Ali to Europe in 1826 was [[Rifa'a el-Tahtawi|Rifa'a Rafi' al-Tahtawi]]. The five years he spent in [[Paris]] left a permanent mark on him. After his return to Egypt he wrote about his impressions of France and translated numerous European works into [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. Tahtawi was impressed with Europe's technological and scientific advancement and political philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Rogan | first1 = Eugene | title = The Arabs: A History | publisher = Basic Books | year = 2009 | pages = 86–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having studied [[Islamic Law]], he argued that "it was necessary to adapt the [[Sharia]] to new circumstances" and that there was not much difference between "the principles of Islamic law and those principles of 'natural law' on which the codes of modern Europe were based".&lt;ref name="AH1983: 75"&gt;[[#AH1983|Albert, ''Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age'', 1983]]: p.75&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Tahtawi, Khayr al-Din was also sent to Paris where he spent four years. After his return from Europe he wrote a book in which he argued that the only way to strengthen the Muslim States was by borrowing ideas and institutions from Europe, and that this did not contradict the spirit of the Sharia.&lt;ref name="AH1983: 88"&gt;[[#AH1983|Albert, ''Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age'', 1983]]: pp.88&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modernization reforms in the Ottoman Empire ===
In the period between 1839 and 1876 the Ottoman government began instituting large-scale reforms as a way to modernize and strengthen the empire.{{clarify||This subsection needs work. Since the Empire was widely called "The Sick Man of Europe" the reforms didn't work. So an analyst needs to tell us why|date=December 2010}} Known as the [[Tanzimat]], many of these reforms involved adopting successful European practices that were considered antithetical to conservative Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Rogan | first1 = Eugene | title = The Arabs: A History | publisher = Basic Books | year = 2009 | pages = 90}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to military and administrative reforms, Ottoman rulers implemented reforms in the sphere of education, law, and the economy. This included new universities and changes in curricula, as well new economic systems and institutions. There were also European-inspired changes to law that restricted Islamic law to family affairs such as marriage and inheritance.&lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Esposito|first1=John L., |chapter="Contemporary Islam" |title=The Oxford History of Islam|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/book/islam-9780195107999/islam-9780195107999-chapter-15 |editor=John L. Esposito|publisher=Oxford Islamic Studies Online|accessdate=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Ottoman Empire]] was the first{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} [[Muslim country]] where modernity surfaced, with major shifts in scientific and legal thought.&lt;ref name="PW2001: 970"&gt;[[#PW2001|Watson, ''The Modern Mind'', 2001]]: p.970&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1834, [[Ishak Efendi]] published ''Mecmua-i Ulum-i Riyaziye'', a four volume text introducing many modern scientific concepts to the Muslim world. [[Kudsi Efendi]] also published ''Asrar al-Malakut'' in 1846 in an attempt to reconcile [[Copernican revolution|Copernican astronomy]] with Islam. The first modern Turkish chemistry text was published in 1848, and the first modern Biology text in 1865.&lt;ref name="PW2001: 971"&gt;[[#PW2001|Watson, ''The Modern Mind'', 2001]]: p.971&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, the Turks adopted the metric system in 1869. These shifts in scientific thought coincided with [[Tanzimat]], a reform policy undertaken by the Sultans of the Ottoman Empire that was inspired by French [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]]. This reform confined [[sharia]] to family law.&lt;ref name="PW2001: 970"/&gt; The key figure in the Turkish modernist movement was [[Namik Kemal]], the editor of a journal called ''Freedom''. His goal was to promote [[freedom of the press]], the [[separation of powers]], [[equality before the law]], scientific freedom, and a reconciliation between [[parliamentary democracy]] and the [[Qur'an]].&lt;ref name="PW2001: 970"/&gt;

===The Greater Muslim world===
The influence of modernism in the Muslim world resulted in a cultural revival.&lt;ref name="PW2001: 973"/&gt; Dramatic plays became more common, as did newspapers. Notable European works were analyzed and translated.

Legal reform was attempted in Egypt, Tunisia, the Ottoman Empire, and Iran, and in some cases these reforms were adopted.&lt;ref name="PW2001: 974"&gt;[[#PW2001|Watson, ''The Modern Mind'', 2001]]: p.974&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts were made to restrict the power of government. Polygamy was ended in India.&lt;ref name="PW2001: 975"&gt;[[#PW2001|Watson, ''The Modern Mind'', 2001]]: p.975&lt;/ref&gt; Azerbaijan granted suffrage to women in 1918 (before several European countries).&lt;ref name="PW2001: 975"/&gt;

At the recommendations of reform-minded Islamic scholars, western sciences were taught in new schools.&lt;ref name="PW2001: 974"/&gt; Much of this had to do with the intellectual appeal of [[social Darwinism]], since it led to the conclusion that an old-fashioned Muslim society could not compete in the modern world.&lt;ref name="PW2001: 974"/&gt;

In 19th century [[Iran]], [[Mirza Malkom Khan]] arrived after being educated in [[Paris]]. He created a newspaper called ''Qanun'', where he advocated the [[separation of powers]], secular law, and a [[bill of rights]].&lt;ref name="PW2001: 971"/&gt; [[Jamal al-Din al-Afghani]], who was politically active in the Islamic world and published the pamphlet "Al-'Urwa al-Wuthqà" during a brief spell in France, proclaiming that Europe had become successful due to its laws and its science. He became critical of other Muslim scholars for stifling scientific thought,&lt;ref name="PW2001: 972"&gt;[[#PW2001|Watson, ''The Modern Mind'', 2001]]: p.972&lt;/ref&gt; and hoped to encourage scientific inquiry in the [[Muslim world]].

== Modernism, religion and ideology==
 {{Aqidah|Five Pillars}}

===Islamic Modernism===
{{main article|Islamic Modernism}}
Modernism impacted interpretations of Islam. One movement was Islamic Modernism, which was both an attempt to provide an Islamic response to the challenges presented by European colonial expansion, and an effort to reinvigorate and reform Islam from within as a way to counter the perceived weakness and decline of Muslim societies in the 19th and early 20th centuries. It called for "a 'reformation' or reinterpretation ([[ijtihad]]) of Islam", and emerged in the Muslim world from Egypt to Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies.com"/&gt;

Islamic modernists argued that Islam and modernity were compatible and "asserted the need to reinterpret and reapply the principles and ideals of Islam to formulate new responses to the political, scientific, and cultural challenges of the West and of modern life".&lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies.com"/&gt; The reforms they proposed challenged the status quo maintained by the conservative Muslims scholars ([[ulama]]), who saw the established law as the ideal order that had to be followed and upheld the doctrine of [[taqlid]] (imitation / blind following). Islamic modernists saw the resistance to change on the part of the conservative ulama as a major cause for the problems the Muslim community was facing as well as its inability to counter western hegemony.

====Modernists====
[[Jamal al-Din al-Afghani]] (1838–1897) is regarded as one of the pioneers of Islamic modernism. He believed that Islam was compatible with science and reason and that in order to counter European power the Muslim world had to embrace progress.&lt;ref name="AH1983: 103–129"&gt;[[#AH1983|Albert, ''Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age'', 1983]]: pp.103–129&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Muhammad Abduh]] (1849–1905) was a disciple and collaborator of al-Afghani. He was even more influential than his master and is often referred to as the founder of Islamic modernism. Abduh was born and raised in Egypt and was a scholar of Islam (alim). He taught at [[al-Azhar]] and other institutions and in 1899 became [[Mufti]] of Egypt. Abduh believed that the Islamic world was suffering from an inner decay and was in need of a revival.&lt;ref name="AH1983: 136"&gt;[[#AH1983|Albert, ''Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age'', 1983]]: p.136&lt;/ref&gt; Asserting that "Islam could be the moral basis of a modern and progressive society",&lt;ref name="AH1983: 140"&gt;[[#AH1983|Albert, ''Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age'', 1983]]: p.140&lt;/ref&gt; he was critical of both [[secularists]] and the conservative ulama. He called for a legal reform and the reinterpretation (ijtihad) of Islamic law according to modern conditions. While critical of the West, he believed that it was necessary to borrow or assimilate what was good from it.&lt;ref name="AH1983: 156"&gt;[[#AH1983|Albert, ''Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age'', 1983]]: p.156&lt;/ref&gt;  Abduh became a leading judge in [[Egypt]] after political activities in Paris as al-Afghani's assistant. He pushed for secular law, religious reform, and education for girls.&lt;ref name="PW2001: 972"/&gt; He hoped that Egypt would ultimately become a free republic, much like how France had transformed from an absolute monarchy.&lt;ref name="PW2001: 973"&gt;[[#PW2001|Watson, ''The Modern Mind'', 2001]]: p.973&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Muhammad Rashid Rida]] (1869–1935) also became active in the Egyptian modernization movement as Abduh's disciple, although he was born and educated in [[Syria]]. ''Al-Manar'' was his journal, through which he initially advocated greater openness to science and foreign influence.&lt;ref name="PW2001: 973"/&gt; He also stated that sharia was relatively silent about agriculture, industry, and trade, and that these areas of knowledge needed renewal.&lt;ref name="PW2001: 973"/&gt; He would eventually evolve to conservative positions close to Wahhabism. [[Qasim Amin]] was another reformer in Egypt and Abduh's disciple who was heavily concerned with the rights of women.

Khayr al-Din al-Tunisi was similarly educated in Paris around the same time. He surveyed the political systems of 21 European countries in an effort to reform [[Tunisia]].&lt;ref name="PW2001: 971"/&gt;

Notable Modernists on the Indian subcontinent include [[Sayyid Ahmad Khan]] (1817–1898) and [[Muhammad Iqbal]] (1877–1938) in the Indian subcontinent (the latter was also the conceiver of the modern state of [[Pakistan]]). Like al-Afghani and Abduh, they rejected the doctrine of taqlid and asserted the need for Islam to be reinterpreted according to modern conditions.&lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies.com"/&gt;

Other Modernists include [[Mahmud Tarzi]] of [[Afghanistan]], [[Chiragh Ali]] of [[India]], [[Ahmad Dahlan]] of [[Java]], and [[Wang Jingzhai]] of [[China]].&lt;ref name="PW2001: 971"/&gt;

Although Islamic modernists were subject to the criticism that the reforms they promoted amounted to westernizing Islam, their legacy was significant and their thought influenced future generations of reformers.&lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies.com"/&gt;

==== Pakistan and Turkey ====

[[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]], the founder of [[Pakistan]], was also a prominent Muslim modernist of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dawn.com/2012/12/25/muslim-modernism-and-jinnah/|title=Muslim modernism and Jinnah|work=Dawn|date=25 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pakistanarmy.gov.pk/awpreview/pDetails.aspx?pType=PressRelease&amp;pID=82|title=Jinnah's vision of Pakistan|work=Pakistan Army|accessdate=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Islamism sidebar|Manifestations}}
In some parts of the world, the project of Islamic modernity continued from the same trajectory before World War I. This was especially the case in the new [[Republic of Turkey]], under [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]]. But in Egypt, [[Hassan al-Banna]] founded the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], the first [[Islamist]] organization, which had no interest in reinterpreting Islam to make it compatible with modernity.

Turkey has continued to be at the forefront of modernising Islam. In 2008 its Department of Religious Affairs launched a review of all the [[hadith]]s, the sayings of [[Mohammed]] upon which most of [[sharia|Islamic law]] is based. The School of Theology at [[Ankara University]] undertook this forensic examination with the intent of removing centuries of often conservative cultural baggage and rediscovering the spirit of reason in the original message of Islam. One expert at London's [[Chatham House]] compared these revisions to the Christian [[Protestant Reformation]]. Turkey has also trained hundreds of women as theologians, and sent them senior [[imam]]s known as ''vaizes'' all over the country, away from the relatively liberal capital and coastal cities, to explain these re-interpretations at town hall meetings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7264903.stm "Turkey in radical revision of Islamic texts"]  Robert Pigott, Religious affairs correspondent, [[BBC News]], 26 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== After World War I ===
The aftermath of [[World War I]] resulted in the [[Partitioning of the Ottoman Empire|fall of the Ottoman Empire]] and the [[History of the middle east#European domination|domination]] of the Middle East by European powers such as Britain and France. Intellectual historians such as [[Peter Watson (intellectual historian)|Peter Watson]] suggest that World War I marks the end of the main Islamic modernist movements, and that this is the point where many Muslims "lost faith with the culture of science and materialism",&lt;ref name="PW2001: 1096"&gt;[[#PW2001|Watson, ''The Modern Mind'', 2001]]: p.1096&lt;/ref&gt; but that several parallel intellectual streams emerged thereafter.

=== Arab socialism ===
{{Main article|Arab socialism}}

[[Arab socialism]] of the [[Baath Party|Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party]] and [[Nasserism|Nasserite]] movement emerged as a stream of thought during decolonialization of Arab countries. It emphasized ethnicity, culture, politics and played down the role of religion.&lt;ref name="PW2001: 1096"/&gt; Its popularity peaked in the 50s and 60s.

As a political ideology based on an amalgamation of [[Pan-Arabism]] and socialism, Arab socialism is distinct from the much broader tradition of socialist thought in the Arab world which predates Arab socialism by as much as 50 years. [[Michel Aflaq]], the principal founder of ba'athism and the Ba'ath Party, coined the term in order to distinguish his version of socialist ideology from the [[Marxism|Marxist socialism]] in Eastern Europe and Eastern Asia, and [[social democracy]] in Western Europe.

The [[Six-Day War]] between [[Israel]] and its neighbours ended in a decisive loss for the Muslim side. Many in the Islamic world saw this as the failure of socialism. It was at this point that "fundamental and militant Islam began to fill the political vacuum created".&lt;ref name="PW2001: 1096"/&gt;

=== Islamic fundamentalism ===
{{Further information|Islamic revival}}

In the late 20th century an Islamic Revival or Islamic Awakening developed in the [[Muslim World]]. (Islamic fundamentalism is the common term in the West used to refer to contemporary Islamic revivalism, according to John Esposito.&lt;ref name=Esposito&gt;{{cite web|last1=Esposito|first1=John L.|title=Islamic Fundamentalism|url=http://www.notredamedesion.org/en/dialogue_docs.php?a=3b&amp;id=16|website=Notre Dame de Sion|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

It was manifested in greater religious piety and in a growing adoption of [[Islamic culture]].&lt;ref name="Lapidus 11"&gt;Lapidus, p.823&lt;/ref&gt; One striking example of it is the increase in attendance at the ''[[Hajj]]'', the annual pilgrimage to [[Mecca]], which grew from 90,000 in 1926 to 2 million in 1979.&lt;ref name=Kepel-75&gt;Kepel, Gilles, ''Jihad: on the Trail of Political Islam'', Harvard University Press, 2002, p.75&lt;/ref&gt; But the said increase in the number of pilgrims may also be attributed to other factors such as increase in populations, modern transportation facilities and to some extent the over all financial prosperity of the Muslims all over the world thus making the Pilgrimage affordable to more and more Muslim populations.

Two of the most important events that fueled or inspired the resurgence were the [[1973 oil crisis|Arab oil embargo]] and subsequent quadrupling of the price of oil in the mid-1970s, and the 1979 [[Iranian Revolution]] that established an [[Islamic republic]] in [[Iran]] under [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Khomeini]]. The first created a flow of many billions of dollars from [[Saudi Arabia]] to fund Islamic books, scholarships, fellowships, and [[mosque]]s around the world; the second undermined the assumption that [[Westernization]] strengthened [[List of Muslim majority countries|Muslim countries]] and was the irreversible trend of the future.&lt;ref name=Kepel-75/&gt;

The revival is a reversal of the Westernisation approach common in Arab and Asian governments earlier in the 20th century. It is often associated with the political Islamic movement, [[Islamism]], and other forms of [[Islamization|re-Islamisation]]. While the revival has also been accompanied by some religious extremism and attacks on civilians and military targets by the extremists, this represents only a small part of the revival.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}&lt;!-- per the IP editor --&gt;

The revival has also seen a proliferation of [[Islamic extremist groups]] in the [[Middle East]] and elsewhere in the Muslim World, who have voiced their anger at perceived exploitation as well as  materialism, Westernization, [[democracy]] and modernity, which are most commonly associated with accepting Western secular beliefs and values. The spread of secularism has caused great concerns among many [[Islamic political groups]]. It has been the reasoning for the Islamization of politics and protest, due to the large Muslim majority in the Middle East as well as the region's imperial past.&lt;ref&gt;Fawcett, L (2005) ''International Relations of the Middle East'', UK: Oxford University Press, p 72&lt;/ref&gt; For Islamic countries in the Middle East, there is not necessarily a problem as such with modernity, however, "the problem is when modernity comes wrapped with westernization, with absolutely and utterly rampant materialism".&lt;ref&gt;BBC News online, ''Islam and the West'', Monday, 12 August 2002, 14:11 GMT 15:11 UK&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book, ''Political Islam: Religion and Politics in the Arab World'' (1994), the author N. Ayubi explained what he believes to be the two main concerns of Islamic political movements and extremist groups in the Middle East; 1) the Western belief in a bureaucratic state and 2) the secular values and beliefs associated with concepts such as modernity.&lt;ref&gt;Ayubi, N. N. M. (1994) ''Political Islam: Religion and Politics in the Arab World'', London: Routledge p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

According to John Esposito:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The tendency to judge the actions of Muslims in splendid isolation, to generalize from the actions of the few to the many, to disregard similar excesses committed in the name of other religions and ideologies ... is not new.&lt;ref&gt;Milton-Edwards, B(1999) ''Islamic Politics in Palestine'', UK: I. B. Tauris &amp; Co Ltd, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The number of militant Islamic movements calling for "an Islamic state and the end of Western influence" is relatively small.&lt;ref&gt;Ayubi, N. N. M. (1994) ''Political Islam: Religion and Politics in the Arab World'', London: Routledge p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; According to polls taken in 2008 and 2010 by Pew and Gallop, pluralities of the population in Muslim-majority countries are undecided as to what extent religion (and certain interpretations of) should influence public life, politics, and the legal system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gallup.com/press/109693/Islam-Democracy.aspx/ "Islam and Democracy"]"Gallup Poll", February 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pewglobal.org/2010/12/02/muslims-around-the-world-divided-on-hamas-and-hezbollah/ "Most Embrace a Role for Islam in Politics, Muslim Publics Divided on Hamas and Hezbollah"].

==Life and career==

After teaching for some years in [[Newquay]], Cornwall, he returned to Oxford to undertake doctoral research on the naval history of the [[Restoration (1660)|Restoration]] period. He was awarded the degree of DPhil in 1986. He subsequently taught history and politics at [[Bedford Modern School]], also serving as a Sub-Lieutenant RNR (CCF). Ultimately, he served as Deputy Head (Academic) at BMS from 2000 to 2004. He then gave up full-time teaching to develop his writing career.

==Published works==

Davies's first book, ''Gentlemen and Tarpaulins: The Officers and Men of the Restoration Navy'' (1991) was a revised version of his doctoral thesis .&lt;ref&gt;The Officers and Men of the Restoration Navy;
J. D. Davies [http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780198202639.do?keyword=gentlemen+and+tarpaulins&amp;sortby=bestMatches]&lt;/ref&gt; His second book, ''Pepys's Navy: Ships, Men and Warfare 1649–89'', was published in 2008, followed in 2010 by his first non-naval book, ''Blood of Kings: the Stuarts, the Ruthvens and the ‘Gowrie Conspiracy’''. 

Davies has contributed many articles and essays to historical journals and other works, including 67 entries in the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' and a chapter in the ''Oxford History of the Royal Navy''. ''Britannia's Dragon: a Naval History of Wales'' was published in 2013 by the History Press, and he is working on a history of the Stepney family, baronets of Llanelli.

His non-fiction book ''Kings of the Sea: Charles II, James II and the Royal Navy'', was published by in 2017.

===Matthew Quinton novels===
Set in the period Davies had been researching for over 25 years, the series of novels centre on the adventures of Captain Matthew Quinton, one of the young "gentlemen captains" promoted by King [[Charles II of England]] despite their almost complete lack of experience of the sea. The first book, ''Gentleman Captain'', published in North America in 2009, was very well received, being described by Booklist as "a splendid book, with terrific characters, a thrilling adventure, and a wonderful sense of time and place" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.booklistonline.com/Gentleman-Captain-J-D-Davies/pid=4246515 |title=Gentleman Captain; Davies, J. D |publisher=Booklistonline.com |accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Kirkus Reviews as "a delightful tale" .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kirkusreviews.com/search/?q=gentleman+captain&amp;x=15&amp;y=12 |work=Kirkus Reviews |accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent books in the series (as of June 2018) include ''The Mountain of Gold'', ''The Blast that Tears the Skies'', ''The Lion of Midnight'', ''The Battle Of All The Ages'', ''Death's Bright Angel'', ''The Rage of Fortune''&lt;ref&gt; https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1309817.J_D_Davies&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Devil Upon the Wave''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Devil-Upon-Matthew-Quinton-Journals-ebook/dp/B07CPM9JQS/ref=sr_1_11?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1529442294&amp;sr=1-11&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Rodger Brandon''' (1927 – 19 September 2015) was an American academic who was a professor of Asian theater specializing in [[Kabuki]] and [[Sanskrit drama|Sanskrit]] theater at the [[University of Hawaii]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |url=http://www.hawaii.edu/news/2015/09/28/in-memoriam-asian-theatre-pioneer-james-brandon/ |title=In Memoriam: Asian Theatre Pioneer James Brandon |work=University of Hawaiʻi System News |date=28 September 2015 |access-date=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the generation of scholars who first brought Asian theater to English-speaking audiences in the post-War period, translating dozens of plays and directing many performances, some of which toured widely throughout the United States.

==Biography==
Brandon was drafted into the military in 1950 and was stationed in Japan and Korea during the Korean War. It was with only two days left before his tour ended and he returned to the United States that he saw his first kabuki performance. It was this performance that awakened his interest in Asian theater. He returned to the University of Wisconsin–Madison to take a Ph.D. in theater on the [[G.I. Bill]].&lt;ref&gt;Jortner and Foley, 2001, p. 343&lt;/ref&gt;

After completing his Ph.D., he entered the foreign service where he was a cultural affairs officer stationed in Jakarta, Indonesia from 1955-1957.

The Japanese government awarded him the [[Order of the Rising Sun#4th Class.2C Gold Rays with Rosette|Order of the Rising Sun, Golden Rays with Rosette, Imperial Decoration]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Jortner and Foley, 2001, p. 350&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarly contributions==
In 1965, along with [[Andrew T. Tsubaki]] and Farley Richmond, he founded the Afro-Asian Theater Project, which after a series of reorganizations has been known since 1987 as the [[Association for Asian Performance]].&lt;ref&gt;Brandon, 2011, pp. 281-282&lt;/ref&gt;

He co-founded the ''[[Asian Theatre Journal]]'' with [[Elizabeth Wichmann-Walczak]] in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Jortner and Foley, 2001, p. 352&lt;/ref&gt;

There Stephens received an education in the Classics at two privately tutored schools. At the age of 13 he enrolled at [[Columbia College of Columbia University|Columbia College]], graduating at the top of his class four years later in 1822.&lt;ref&gt;Harris 2006, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephens read with interest early accounts of ruined cities of [[Mesoamerica]] by such writers and explorers as [[Alexander von Humboldt]] and [[Juan Galindo]].

In 1839, President [[Martin Van Buren]] commissioned Stephens as Special [[Ambassador (diplomacy)|Ambassador]] to Central America. While there, the government of the [[Federal Republic of Central America]] fell apart, in a civil war. He later published an account of the events he witnessed in Central America, ''Incidents of Travel in Central America, Chiapas and Yucatán''.

Stephens and his traveling companion, architect and draftsman [[Frederick Catherwood]] first came across Maya ruins at [[Copán]], having landed in [[British Honduras]] (now [[Belize]]). They were astonished at their findings and spent two weeks mapping the site. They surmised that it must have been built by some long-forgotten people, as they could not imagine it was the native Mayans. Stephens was actually able to buy the city of Copan for a sum of $50 and had dreams of floating it down the river and into museums in the United States.

They went on to [[Palenque]], [[Quiriguá]] and [[Uxmal]]. They reached Palenque on May 11, 1840 and left in early June. While there, they documented the Temple of the Inscriptions, the Temple of the Cross, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Foliated Cross.&lt;ref&gt;McNally (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt;

They continued investigating Maya ruins with a return trip to [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]] in October 1841. According to Stephens's book about the trip, they visited a total of 44 Mayan sites such as Mayapan, Uxmal, Kabah, the gateway at Labná, Sayil, Xtampak, Chichen Itza, Tulum, and Izamal. In Uxmal, they documented the Governor's House, the Nunnery Quadrangle and the Pyramid of the Magician. Catherwood also drew a famous view of the well at Bolonchén.&lt;ref&gt;Fabio Bourbon, The Lost Cities of the Mayas, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Catherwood's drawings and lithographs showed, without question, the Maya to have been the authors of some of the most artistic and intellectual works of pre-Columbian America. Besides large constructions, they produced works of artistic refinement such as stone and plaster sculptures, frescoes, painted pottery and bas-reliefs in wood. As a result of his explorations, Stephens argued convincingly that the Mayans built the ancient Central American cities in contrast to the theory that ethnic groups from European or Asian civilizations had built them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=105|edition=|pages=|year=2012|accessdate=May 17, 2014|publisher=Courier Corporation|author=L. Sprague de Camp|volume=|location=|title=Lost Continents|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HTxGWKsiJ-8C&amp;pg=PA105&amp;dq=mayan+girls+chinese&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hOehVZnBOIeNNty5gfgM&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwBzge#v=onepage&amp;q=mayan%20girls%20chinese&amp;f=false|isbn=0486147924}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephens's books served to inspire [[Edgar Allan Poe]],&lt;ref&gt;Harris 2006, p.2.&lt;/ref&gt; who reviewed three of Stephens's books for the ''New York Review'' and ''[[Graham's Magazine]]''.

==Panama Railroad Company==
At the time England enjoyed a monopoly over the ocean navigation to and from the United States. Stephens obtained a charter from the state of New York, and incorporated the [[White Star Line|Ocean Steam Navigation Company]]. The company acquired two steam ships, the ''Washington'' and the ''Hermann'' which made journeys to Europe.

When the [[Panama Railroad Company]] was founded in 1849, Stephens was chosen to be Vice President. He visited [[Panama]] and [[Republic of the New Granada|New Granada]] to make arrangements for the laying of the railroad. On his way to [[Bogotá]], the capital of New Granada, he fell off his mule and sustained severe injuries from which he never fully recovered. He returned to the United States, and was appointed President of the railroad. However, he suffered from a disease of the liver, and died on October 13, 1852. He was buried at [[New York City Marble Cemetery]].

Stephens is the subject of the following biography: ''Maya Explorer'' by [[Victor Wolfgang von Hagen]], first published in 1947.

The '''Leawood Pump House''' (also known as High Peak Pump House) was built near [[Cromford]], [[Derbyshire]], England in 1849 to supply water to the [[Cromford Canal]], built some 50 years previously.&lt;ref&gt;''Civil Engineering Heritage, eastern and central England'', E. A. Labrum&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[Grade II*]] listed building.&lt;ref name="Listing"&gt;{{NHLE |num=1247889 |desc=High Peak Pump House |access-date=5 March 2017 |mode=cs2 |fewer-links=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Leawood.jpg|thumb|right|Leawood pump house]]

Located a little along the canal towpath from [[High Peak Junction]], it stands to a height of {{convert|45|ft}} on the right bank of the [[River Derwent, Derbyshire|River Derwent]], at the end of the Derwent Aqueduct, and has a {{convert|95|ft|adj=on}} chimney stack with a cast-iron cap.

The [[Watt steam engine|Watt-type beam engine]] was designed and erected by Graham and Company of Milton Works, [[Elsecar]], Sheffield. The beam length is {{convert|33|ft}}, the piston diameter {{convert|50|in|m}}, stroke of {{convert|10|ft}} and the engine works at 7 strokes per minute. The boilers, replaced in 1900, have a pressure of 40 p.s.i. 

Water is drawn from the River Derwent through a {{convert|150|yd|adj=on}} tunnel to a reservoir in the basement. It is then lifted {{convert|30|ft}} and discharged into the canal.

The immense size of the pump (which can transfer almost four tons of water per stroke and seven strokes a minute, a total of over 39,000 tons of water per 24 hours) is explained by the fact that there were restrictions on removing water from the Derwent river, this being allowed only between 8 p.m. on Saturdays and 8 p.m. on Sundays.

The pumphouse worked continuously from 1849 until 1944 when the canal closed. It was restored in 1979 by the Cromford Canal Society and is run periodically.

I. du Pont de Nemours and Company]].&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web |url=http://findingaid.winterthur.org/html/HTML_Finding_Aids/ARC21.htm |title=The Winterthur Archives |date= |accessdate=2012-11-28 |quote=Louise du Pont Crowninshield (1877-1958) was the daughter of Col. Henry Algernon du Pont and Mary Pauline Foster and sister to Henry Francis du Pont.  On June 28, 1900, she married Francis Boardman Crowninshield. ... |publisher=[[Winterthur Museum]] |location= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
She was a daughter of [[Henry A. du Pont]] (1838–1926) and Pauline Foster du Pont (1849–1902); her brother was [[Henry Francis du Pont]] (1880–1969).&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; She was born, raised, and educated at the family estate, [[Winterthur Museum and Country Estate|Winterthur]], north of [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]], [[Delaware]]. A debutante whose coming-out party was held in [[New York City]] in 1896, she socialized with members of the city's most exclusive families.

===Marriage===
In 1900, Louise du Pont married [[Francis Boardman Crowninshield]] (1869–1950), a renowned yacht-racer and expert marksman of the [[First Families of Boston|Boston Brahmin]] [[Crowninshield family]].&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; There were no children by this marriage. The Crowninshields had homes in [[Marblehead, Massachusetts|Marblehead]] and Boston, Massachusetts; Boca Grande, Florida; and the original du Pont family estate, [[Eleutherian Mills]], north of Wilmington, Delaware.

===Activities===
Louise du Pont Crowninshield actively participated in charitable organizations, horticulture, [[historic preservation]], and collected antiques and [[Traditional rug hooking|hooked rugs]]. One of Louise du Pont Crowninshield's earliest historic restoration projects was the original du Pont family estate, Eleutherian Mills, where she resided during the spring and fall months. She was a founding trustee of the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] in 1949 and was vice-chairman of the board in 1953. In recognition of her services to historic preservation, the National Trust instituted an annual award, the Louise Evalina du Pont Crowninshield Award.

In 1955, President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] appointed her to the Boston National Historic Sites Commission. She was also involved with historic restoration in Virginia, particularly the Kenmore Association, of which she was a regent. [[Kenmore (Fredericksburg, Virginia)|Kenmore]] was the [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]], home of [[Fielding Lewis]] and his wife, [[Betty Washington Lewis]], who was [[George Washington]]'s sister. Crowninshield often provided financial assistance and artifacts when needed at historic sites. In addition, she was a member or trustee of numerous historical societies, museums, art, and symphony organizations.

[[File:JohannLudwigTieck.jpg|thumb|Johann Ludwig Tieck]]
'''Johann Ludwig Tieck''' ({{IPAc-en|t|iː|k}}; {{IPA-de|tiːk|lang}}; 31 May 1773 – 28 April 1853) was a German poet, fiction writer, translator, and critic. He was one of the founding fathers of the [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]] in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.

==Early life==
Tieck was born in [[Berlin]], the son of a rope-maker. His siblings were the sculptor [[Christian Friedrich Tieck]] and the poet [[Sophie Tieck]]. He was educated at the {{Interlanguage link multi|Friedrichswerdersches Gymnasium|de}}, where he learned Greek and Latin, as required in most preparatory schools. He also began learning Italian at a very young age, from a grenadier with whom he became acquainted. Through this friendship, Tieck was given a first-hand look at the poor, which could be linked to his work as a Romanticist. He later attended the universities of [[University of Halle|Halle]], [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]], and [[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg|Erlangen]]. At Göttingen, he studied [[Shakespeare]] and [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] drama.

On returning to Berlin in 1794, Tieck attempted to make a living by writing. He contributed a number of short stories (1795–1798) to the series ''Straussfedern'', published by the bookseller [[C. F. Nicolai]] and originally edited by [[J. K. A. Musäus]]. He also wrote ''Abdallah'' (1796) and a novel in letters, ''William Lovell'' (3 vols. 1795–1796).

==Adoption of Romanticism==
Tieck's transition to [[Romanticism]] is seen in the series of plays and stories published under the title ''Volksmärchen von Peter Lebrecht'' (3 vols., 1797), a collection containing the fairy tale ''[[Der blonde Eckbert]]'', which blends exploration of the paranoiac mind with the realm of the supernatural, and a witty dramatic satire on Berlin literary taste, ''[[Der gestiefelte Kater]]''. With his school and college friend [[Wilhelm Heinrich Wackenroder]] (1773–1798), he planned the novel ''[[Franz Sternbalds Wanderungen]]'' (vols. i–ii. 1798), which with Wackenroder's ''Herzensergiessungen'' (1796), was the first expression of the Romantic enthusiasm for old German art.

In 1798 Tieck married and in the following year settled in [[Jena]], where he, the two brothers [[August Wilhelm von Schlegel|August]] and [[Friedrich von Schlegel|Friedrich Schlegel]], and [[Novalis]] were the leaders of the early Romantic school (also known as [[Jena Romanticism]]). His writings between 1798 and 1804 include the satirical drama, ''Prinz Zerbino'' (1799), and ''Romantische Dichtungen'' (2 vols., 1799–1800). The latter contains Tieck's most ambitious dramatic poems, ''Leben und Tod der heiligen Genoveva'', ''Leben und Tod des kleinen Rotkäppchens'', which were followed in 1804 by the "comedy" in two parts, ''Kaiser Oktavianus''. These dramas are typical plays of the first Romantic school. Although formless and destitute of dramatic qualities, they show the influence of both [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca|Calderón]] and Shakespeare. ''Kaiser Oktavianus'' is a poetic glorification of the [[Middle Ages]].

In 1801 Tieck went to [[Dresden]], then lived for a time at [[Cybinka|Ziebingen]] near [[Frankfurt (Oder)|Frankfurt]], and spent many months in Italy. In 1803 he published a translation of ''Minnelieder aus der schwäbischen Vorzeit'', then between 1799 and 1804 an excellent version of ''[[Don Quixote]]'', and in 1811 two volumes of Elizabethan dramas, ''Altenglisches Theater''. From 1812 to 1817 he collected in three volumes a number of his earlier stories and dramas, under the title ''Phantasus''. In this collection appeared the stories "Der Runenberg", "Die Elfen", "Der Pokal", and the dramatic fairy tale "Fortunat".

In 1817 Tieck visited England in order to collect materials for a work on Shakespeare, which was never finished. In 1819 he settled permanently in Dresden, and from 1825 he was literary adviser to the Court Theatre. His semi-public readings from the dramatic poets gave him a reputation which extended far beyond the capital of the [[Kingdom of Saxony]]. The new series of short stories which he began to publish in 1822 also won him a wide popularity. Notable among these are "Die Gemälde", "Die Reisenden", "Die Verlobung", and "Des Lebens Überfluss".

More ambitious and on a wider canvas are the historical or semi-historical novels ''Dichterleben'' (1826), ''Der Aufruhr in den Cevennen'' (1826, unfinished), and ''Der Tod des Dichters'' (1834). ''Der junge Tischlermeister'' (1836; but begun in 1811) is a work written under the influence of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]'s ''Wilhelm Meister''. His story of ''Vittoria Accorombona'' (1840) was written in the style of the French Romanticists and shows a falling-off.

==Later years==
In later years Tieck carried on a varied literary activity as a critic (''Dramaturgische Blätter'', 2 vols., 1825–1826; ''Kritische Schriften'', 2 vols., 1848). He also edited the translation of Shakespeare by [[August Wilhelm Schlegel]], who was assisted by Tieck's daughter [[Dorothea Tieck|Dorothea]] (1790–1841) and by [[Wolf Heinrich, Graf von Baudissin]] (1789–1878); ''Shakespeares Vorschule'' (2 vols., 1823–1829); and the works of [[Heinrich von Kleist]] (1826) and of [[Jakob Michael Reinhold Lenz]] (1828). In 1841 [[Friedrich Wilhelm IV of Prussia]] invited Tieck to Berlin, where he received a pension for his remaining years. He died in Berlin on 28 April 1853.

==Literary significance==
Tieck's importance lay in the readiness with which he adapted himself to the emerging new ideas which arose at the close of the 18th century, as well as his Romantic works, such as ''Der blonde Eckbert''. His importance in [[German poetry]], however, is restricted to his early period. In later years it was as the helpful friend and adviser of others, or as the well-read critic of wide sympathies, that Tieck distinguished himself.

Tieck also influenced [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Tannhäuser (opera)|Tannhäuser]]''. It was from ''Phantasus'' that Wagner based the idea of Tannhäuser going to see the Pope and of Elisabeth dying in the song battle.

==Works==
Tieck's ''Schriften'' appeared in twenty volumes (1828–1846), and his ''Gesammelte Novellen'' in twelve (1852–1854). ''Nachgelassene Schriften'' were published in two volumes in 1855. There are several editions of ''Ausgewählte Werke'' by H. Welti (8 vols., 1886–1888); by J. Minor (in Kirschner's ''Deutsche Nationalliteratur'', 144, 2 vols., 1885); by G. Klee (with an excellent biography, 3 vols., 1892), and G. Witkowski (4 vols., 1903) and Marianne Thalmann (4 vols., 1963–66).

==Translations==
"The Elves" and "The Goblet" were translated by [[Thomas Carlyle]] in ''German Romance'' (1827), "The Pictures" and "The Betrothal" by Bishop Thirlwall (1825). A translation of ''Vittoria Accorombona'' was published in 1845. A translation of "Des Lebens Überfluss" ("Life's Luxuries", by E. N. Bennett) appeared in ''German Short Stories'' in the [[Oxford University Press]] ''World's Classics'' series in 1934, but the wit of the original comes over more strongly in ''The Superfluities of Life. A Tale Abridged from Tieck,'' which appeared anonymously in ''Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine'' in February 1845. ''The Journey into the Blue Distance'' (''Das Alte Buch: oder Reise ins Blaue hinein'', 1834). "The Romance of Little Red Riding Hood" (1801) was translated by Jack Zipes and included in his book "The Trials and Tribulations of Little Red Riding Hood."

==Influences==
Tieck's biggest influence was 16th-century Italian poet [[Torquato Tasso]], who is featured in Tieck's novel, ''Vittoria Accorombona'', as a secondary character.

==Letters==
Tieck's Letters have been published at various locations:
*''Ludwig Tieck und die Brüder Schlegel. Briefe'' ed. by Edgar Lohner (München 1972)
*''Briefe an Tieck'' were published in 4 vols. by K. von Holtei in 1864.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4317">'''''Madala Panji''''' ([[Oriya language|Odia]] ''ମାଦଳା ପାଞ୍ଜି'') is a chronicle of the [[Jagannath Temple, Puri]], Odisha, India. It describes the historical events of Odisha related to [[Jagannath]] and the Jagannatha Temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jagannath.nic.in/architecture.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120171916/http://jagannath.nic.in/architecture.asp |archivedate=2012-11-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Madala Panji'' dates from the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/355633/Madala-panji Britannica.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Madala Panji's role in Odia history==
While writing Odia history, historians like Sir W.W.Hunter &lt;ref&gt;http://www.boloji.com/index.cfm?md=Content&amp;sd=Articles&amp;ArticleID=6375 asp&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Andrew Stirling]] considered the facts related in Madala Panji as a base. The Madala Panji was traditionally written on a year-to-year basis. On Bijaya-Dashami day, the [[Karan (caste)|Karanas]] (official history writers of Puri, a caste of Odisha, involved in keeping the chronicle. This ritual is cited as a proof that the tradition of keeping this chronicle began with Odia king [[Anantavarman Chodaganga]] Dev (1078–1150) himself. There are some, like Dr. [[Harekrushna Mahatab]], Dr.Nilakantha Dash and Dr. [[Krushna Chandra Panigrahi]] who hold that the Panji dates from the reign of [[Ramachandra Deva I]]  who re-established the worship of Lord Jagannatha after [[Kalapahad]] said to have destroyed it. The arguments are complex, but it is likely that much of the early record was indeed lost in the period that followed Kala Pahad and was rewritten in a fashion that mixed legend with history.

==Writers of Panji==
According to the tradition, Chodaganga created 24 families of Karanas to preserve the temple records. Of these, five were entrusted with the writing and preservation of the Madala Panji. They are:
* Panjia Karan—preserves the Madala Panji
* Tadau Karan—writes the Madala Panji
* Deula Karan—enforces the Madala
* Kotha Karan—the main compiler
* Baithi Karan – assistant

==Classification==
In subsequent stage, due to the bulky size of Madala Panji, its content covering different dimensions related to temple management, it was divided into four parts:
# Bhandara Khanja Madala (maintained by Pattajoshi Mohapatra)
# Deula Madala / Karmangi Madala (maintained by Deula Karana)
# Deshapanji Madala (prepared by Deula Karana)
# Rajakhanja Madala (prepared and maintained by Tadhau Karana),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/june_july-2007/engpdf/Pages91-96.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of Panjis==
There are also five different categories of Panjis. No one has seen them all.
* Raja Khanja—important events of the Rajas. Read on Paush Purnima (Pushyabhishek). Kept by Tadau Karan.
* Desh Khanja—Records gifts of land and money and occasions when the Jagannath temple was plundered. Kept by Kotha Karan.
* Karmangi. Daily rituals. Important events related to the rituals recorded. Announced daily at the Beherana.
* Dina Panji—The daily almanac read by the temple astrologer at the time of the Avakash. These were prepared annually and finalized on Vishuva Sankranti.

Besides the Madala, there were other Karans who wrote regional chronicles, known as Chakadas. "All the Kadatas and Chakadas taken together will be about a cartload."

==Madala Panji in recent years==
Madala Panji language is Odia and was recorded in Odia and Telugu script, preserved in the Manuscript Library in Madras, which speaks about the story regarding image of Nila Madhaba or Lord Jagannath of Udra desa, as Odisha was known in Middle Ages. It seems to have re-written during 16th century when the king of Khurda had newly installed the images after destruction made by Kalapahad, Muslim general of Nawab of Bangal.

A thorough study of the Madala Panji using all the different source materials has apparently not yet been done.

{{Hadith|related}}

'''Muhammad Ardabili''' (Persian: محمد ابن علی اردبیلی) was an eminent Shia transmitter of Muslim tradition in seventeenth century.

==Life==
His complete name was Muhammad Son of Ali Ardabili. there is little information about his life and personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cgie.org.ir/fa/publication/entryview/8795|title=دائرة المعارف بزرگ اسلامی:اردبیلی، محمد|work=cgie.org.ir}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was originally from [[Ardabil]] but most of his life, it seems, passed in [[Baghdad]] and [[Najaf]] in [[Iraq]].

==Scientific career==
He had eminent masters such as Jafar Ibn Abdiah Ibn Ibrahim Kamarehei who was dominant in religious fields and disciplines. The others are like Ali Ibn Ahmad Ibn Kamal Addin Hosein Astarabadi. He travelled also to [[Isfahan]] but its history is not clear. His importance is because of writing the book of Jami Al Rowat&lt;ref name="Ahmed2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ahmed|first=Asad Q.|title=The Religious Elite of the Early Islamic Ḥijāz: Five Prosopographical Case Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v1dwdBDDjcUC&amp;pg=PA275|year=2011|publisher=Occasional Publications UPR|isbn=978-1-900934-13-8|page=275}}&lt;/ref&gt; (compilations of narrators)&lt;ref name="AdelElmi2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adel|first1=Gholamali Haddad|last2=Elmi|first2=Mohammad Jafar|last3=Taromi-Rad|first3=Hassan|title=Hawza-yi 'Ilmiyya, Shi'i Teaching Institution: An Entry from Encyclopaedia of the World of Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EItNVheauSgC&amp;pg=PA291|date=31 August 2012|publisher=EWI Press|isbn=978-1-908433-06-0|page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the subject of transmitters of traditions (Ilm-e- Rijal).

==The book of Jami Al Rowat==
Compilations of narrators is one of the first and important shia books in Ilm-e-rijal. He tries to describe the characters of transmitters of traditions in their classes and evaluate them in accordance to authentic and inauthentic of transmitters. In fact this book could considers as a gloss on the Astarabadi's Talkhis and other books like Montajeb Addin's Al fehrest. This book for a while counted as the original resource among  shia jurists. This book has been written during 25 years and Shah Soleiman given command to produce another transcription of it.

'''Nikolaos Platon''' ([[Greek alphabet|Greek]] {{lang|el|Νικόλαος Πλάτων}}, [[Anglicisation|Anglicised]] ''Nicolas Platon''; {{birth date|1909|1|8}} – {{death date|1992|3|28}}) was a renowned Greek archaeologist. He discovered the [[Minoan civilisation|Minoan]] palace of [[Zakros]] on [[Crete]].

He put forward one of the two systems of relative chronology used by archaeologists for Minoan history. It is based on the development of the architectural complexes known as "palaces" at [[Knossos]], [[Phaistos]], [[Malia, Crete|Malia]], and [[Kato Zakros]], and divides the Minoan period into Prepalatial, Protopalatial, Neopalatial, and Post-palatial periods. The other system is based on pottery styles, as suggested by [[Arthur Evans]].

The '''Metropolitanate of Nisibis''' was an [[East Syriac Rite|East Syriac]] metropolitan province of the [[Church of the East]], between the fifth and seventeenth centuries. The ecclesiastical province of [[Nisibis]] (Syriac: Nisibin, {{lang|syr|ܢܨܝܒܝܢ}}, often abbreviated to Soba, {{lang|syr|ܨܘܒܐ}}) had a number of suffragan dioceses at different periods in its history, including [[Arzun]], Beth Rahimaï, Beth Qardu (later renamed Tamanon), Beth Zabdaï, Qube d’Arzun, Balad, Shigar (Sinjar), [[Armenia (East Syrian Diocese)|Armenia]], Beth Tabyathe and the Kartawaye, Harran and [[Callinicus]] ([[Raqqa]]), [[Maiperqat]] (with Amid and Mardin), Resh{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}aïna, Qarta and Adarma, Qaimar and Hesna d'Kifa.  Aoustan d'Arzun and Beth Moksaye were also suffragan dioceses in the fifth century.

== Background ==
In 363 the Roman emperor [[Jovian (Emperor)|Jovian]] was obliged to cede Nisibis and five neighbouring districts to Persia to extricate the defeated army of his predecessor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] from Persian territory.   The Nisibis region, after nearly fifty years of rule by [[Constantine I|Constantine]] and his Christian successors, may well have contained more Christians than the entire [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanian empire]], and this Christian population was absorbed into the Church of the East in a single generation.  The impact of the cession of Nisibis on the demography of the Church of the East was so marked that the province of Nisibis was ranked second among the five metropolitan provinces established at the synod of Isaac in 410, a precedence apparently conceded without dispute by the bishops of the three older Persian provinces relegated to a lower rank.  The metropolitan of Nisibis ranked below the metropolitan of {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Ilam, but above the metropolitans of Maishan, Adiabene and Beth Garmaï.&lt;ref&gt;Chabot, 272–3&lt;/ref&gt;

The bishop of Nisibis was recognised in Canon XXI of the synod of Isaac as 'metropolitan of [[Arzun]], of Qardu, of Beth Zabdaï, of Beth Rahimaï, of Beth Moksaye, and of the bishops to be found there', and the bishops Daniel of Arzun, Samuel 'of Arzun for Baita d'Aoustan', Daniel of Beth Moksaye, and Abraham of Beth Rahimaï were confirmed as his suffragans.&lt;ref&gt;Chabot, 272–3&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecclesiastical history ==
[[Image:Near East ancient map.jpg|thumb|225px|Nisibis was a frontier town between the Roman and Persian empires]]
The bishop of Nisibis was recognised in 410 as the metropolitan of [[Arzun]] ({{lang|syr|ܐܪܙܘܢ}}), Qardu ({{lang|syr|ܩܪܕܘ}}), Beth Zabdaï ({{lang|syr|ܒܝܬ ܙܒܕܝ}}), Beth Rahimaï ({{lang|syr|ܒܝܬ ܪܚܡܝ}}) and Beth Moksaye ({{lang|syr|ܒܝܬ ܡܘܟܣܝܐ}}).  These were the Syriac names for Arzanene, Corduene, Zabdicene, Rehimene and Moxoene, the five districts ceded by Rome to Persia in 363.  The metropolitan diocese of Nisibis ({{lang|syr|ܢܨܝܒܝܢ}}) and the suffragan dioceses of Arzun, Qardu and Beth Zabdaï were to enjoy a long history, but Beth Rahimaï is not mentioned again, while Beth Moksaye is not mentioned after 424, when its bishop Atticus (probably, from his name, a Roman) subscribed to the acts of the synod of Dadisho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}.  Besides the bishop of Arzun, a bishop of 'Aoustan d’Arzun' (plausibly identified with the district of Ingilene) also attended these two synods, and his diocese was also assigned to the province of Nisibis.  The diocese of Aoustan d'Arzun survived into the sixth century, but is not mentioned after 554.  

During the fifth and sixth centuries three new dioceses in the province of Nisibis were founded in Persian territory, in Beth {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Arabaye (the hinterland of Nisibis, between Mosul and the Tigris and Khabur rivers) and in the hill country to the northeast of Arzun.  By 497 a diocese had been established at Balad (the modern Eski Mosul) on the Tigris, which persisted into the fourteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Fiey, ''POCN'', 57–8&lt;/ref&gt;  By 563 there was also a diocese for [[Shigar (East Syrian Diocese)|Shigar]] (Sinjar), deep inside Beth {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Arabaye, and by 585 a diocese for 'Beth Tabyathe and the Kartawaye', the country to the west of Lake Van inhabited by the Kartaw Kurds.&lt;ref&gt;Fiey, ''POCN'', 134&lt;/ref&gt;  

The famous [[School of Nisibis]] was an important seminary and theological academy of the Church of the East during the late Sassanian period, and in the last two centuries of Sassanian rule generated a remarkable outpouring of East Syriac theological scholarship.

Probably during the Umayyad period, the East Syriac diocese of Armenia was attached to the province of Nisibis.  The bishop Artashahr of Armenia was present at the synod of Dadisho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}} in 424, but the diocese was not assigned to a metropolitan province.  In the late thirteenth century Armenia was certainly a suffragan diocese of the province of Nisibis, and its dependency probably went back to the seventh or eighth century.  The bishops of Armenia appear to have sat at the town of Halat (Ahlat) on the northern shore of [[Lake Van]].

The Arab conquest allowed the East Syriacs to move into western Mesopotamia and establish communities in Damascus and other towns that had formerly been in Roman territory, where they lived alongside much larger Syriac Orthodox, Armenian and Melkite communities.  Some of these western communities were placed under the jurisdiction of the East Syriac metropolitans of Damascus, but others were attached to the province of Nisibis.   The latter included a diocese for Harran and Callinicus (Raqqa), first attested in the eighth century and last mentioned towards the end of the eleventh century, and a diocese at Maiperqat, first mentioned at the end of the eleventh century, whose bishops were also responsible for the East Syrian communities in Amid and Mardin.&lt;ref&gt;Fiey, ''POCN'', 49–50 and 88&lt;/ref&gt;  Eleventh- and thirteenth-century lists of dioceses in the province of Nisibis also mention a diocese for the Syrian town of Resh{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}aïna (Ra{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}s al-{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Ain).  Resh{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}aïna is a plausible location for an East Syriac diocese at this period, but none of its bishops are known.&lt;ref&gt;Fiey, ''POCN'', 124&lt;/ref&gt; 

Changes in the formal and informal titles borne by the metropolitans of Nisibis reflect the shifts in the province's centre of gravity over the centuries.  In 497 the metropolitan Hosea of Nisibis was styled 'metropolitan of the country of Beth {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Arabaye'.&lt;ref&gt;Chabot, 315&lt;/ref&gt;  In the eleventh century the metropolitan {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Abdisho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}} Ibn {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Arid of Nisibis, who became patriarch in 1074, was styled 'metropolitan bishop of Soba [Nisibis] and Beth Nahrin [Mesopotamia]'.&lt;ref&gt;Mari, 129 (Arabic)&lt;/ref&gt;  At the end of the thirteenth century the celebrated East Syriac writer {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Abdisho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}} Bar Brikha, himself metropolitan of Nisibis, referred loosely to his province as 'Soba (Nisibis) and Mediterranean Syria'.&lt;ref&gt;Chabot, 619–20&lt;/ref&gt;  Few Mesopotamian or Syrian dioceses still existed at this period, however, and {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Abdisho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}} was normally styled 'metropolitan of Nisibis and Armenia'.  As far as is known, the title 'metropolitan of Nisibis and Armenia' was used by all of {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Abdisho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}'s successors until 1610, when the East Syriac metropolitan province of Nisibis was abolished.    

{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Abdisho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}} Bar Brikha listed thirteen suffragan dioceses in the province of Nisibis at the end of the thirteenth century, in the following order:  Arzun, Qube, Beth Rahimaï, Balad, Shigar, Qardu, Tamanon, Beth Zabdaï, Halat, Harran, Amid, Resh{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}aïna and 'Adormiah' (Qarta and Adarma).&lt;ref&gt;Chabot, 619–20&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been convincingly argued that {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Abdisho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}} was giving a conspectus of dioceses in the province of Nisibis at various periods in its history rather than an authentic list of late-thirteenth century dioceses, and it is unlikely that the dioceses of Qube, Beth Rahimaï, Harran and Resh{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}aïna still existed at this period.

A diocese was founded around the middle of the thirteenth century to the north of the Tur {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Abdin for the town of Hesna d'Kifa, perhaps in response to East Syriac immigration to the towns of the Tigris plain during the Mongol period.  At the same time, a number of older dioceses may have ceased to exist.  The dioceses of Qaimar and Qarta and Adarma are last mentioned towards the end of the twelfth century, and the diocese of Tamanon in 1265, and it is not clear whether they persisted into the fourteenth century.  The only dioceses in the province of Nisibis definitely in existence at the end of the thirteenth century were Armenia (whose bishops sat at Halat on the northern shore of Lake Van), Shigar, Balad, Arzun and Maiperqat.

{{anchor|Arzun}}

==Diocese of Arzun ==
East Syriac bishops of [[Arzun]] (near present-day [[Siirt]]) are attested between the fifth and thirteenth centuries.  A twelfth-century reference to the diocese of 'Arzun and Beth Dlish' indicates that the bishops of Arzun may have sat at [[Bitlis]].&lt;ref&gt;MS Cambridge Add. 1988&lt;/ref&gt; 

The bishop Daniel of Arzun was confirmed as a suffragan bishop of the metropolitan Hosea of Nisibis in Canon XXI of the synod of Isaac in 410, and was among the signatories of its acts.&lt;ref&gt;Chabot, 272–4&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Dadisho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}} in 424.&lt;ref&gt;Chabot, 285&lt;/ref&gt;

The bishop 'Natum', probably Nathan, of 'Arzun d'Beth d'Aoustan' adhered by letter to the acts of the synod of [[Joseph (Nestorian Patriarch)|Joseph]] in 554.&lt;ref&gt;Chabot, 366&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Qardu}}
== Diocese of Qardu ==

The bishop Ya{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}qob "of Harran and Callinicus" ([[Raqqa]]) is mentioned together with the patriarch [[Yohannan III]] (893–9) in the dating formula of an East Syriac manuscript copied in the monastery of Mar Gabriel near Harran by the deacon Babai in 899.&lt;ref&gt;MS BM Syr (Wright) 161&lt;/ref&gt;

The bishop Yohannan, bishop of {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Ukbara when [[Elijah of Nisibis]] completed his ''Chronography'' in 1018/19, was formerly bishop of Harran.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elijah of Nisibis]], ''Chronography'', i. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bishop Eliya 'of Raqah (Raqqa)' was present at the consecration of the patriarch [[Makkikha I]] in 1092.&lt;ref&gt;Mari, 138 (Arabic), 118 (Latin)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diocese of Maiperqat ==
The bishop Eliya, metropolitan of Damascus when [[Elijah of Nisibis]] completed his ''Chronography'' in 1018/19, was formerly bishop of [[Maiperqat]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Elijah of Nisibis]], ''Chronography'', i. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bishop Yohannan of Maiperqat was present at the consecration of the patriarch [[Makkikha II]] in 1257.&lt;ref&gt;Sliba, 120 (Arabic)&lt;/ref&gt;

The bishop Isho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}dnah of Maiperqat was present at the consecration of the patriarch [[Denha I]] in 1265 (as bishop 'of Mardin').&lt;ref&gt;Sliba, 121–2 (Arabic)&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also present at the consecration of [[Yahballaha III]] in 1281 (as 'bishop of Miyafariqin').&lt;ref&gt;Sliba, 124 (Arabic)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diocese of Balad ==
The bishops Hawah and Shubhalisho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}} of Balad were among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Babaï in 497.&lt;ref&gt;Chabot, 316&lt;/ref&gt;

The bishop Yazdgird of Balad was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Joseph in 554.&lt;ref&gt;Chabot, 366&lt;/ref&gt;

The future patriarch [[Ishoyahb II|Isho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}yahb II]] of Gdala (628–45) was appointed bishop of Balad after the death of the bishop Quriaqos of Balad.&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicle of Seert'' (ed. Scher), ii. 234; Thomas of Marga, ''Book of Governors'' (ed. Wallis Budge), ii. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

The bishop Sabrisho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}} of Balad was appointed metropolitan of Nisibis by the patriarch [[Hnanisho I|Hnanisho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}} I]] after the death of the metropolitan Qamisho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}, probably in 697.&lt;ref&gt;Mari, 64 (Arabic), 57 (Latin)&lt;/ref&gt;

An unnamed bishop of Balad was among the bishops who witnessed a retraction of the Messallian heresy made by the priest Nestorius of the monastery of Mar Yozadaq in 790 before his consecration as bishop of Beth Nuhadra.&lt;ref&gt;Chabot, 608&lt;/ref&gt;

The monk Quriaqos of the [[monastery of Beth ʿAbe]], a native of the town of Gbilta in the [[Tirhan (East Syrian Diocese)|Tirhan]] district, became bishop of Balad at an unknown date in the second half of the eighth century or the first half of the ninth century.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas of Marga, ''Book of Governors'' (ed. Wallis Budge), ii. 447&lt;/ref&gt;

The bishop Yohannan of Balad was appointed metropolitan of Merv by the patriarch Sargis (860–72).&lt;ref&gt;Sliba, 73 (Arabic)&lt;/ref&gt;

The bishop Eliya of Balad was appointed metropolitan of Barda{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}a by the patriarch Mari (987–99).&lt;ref&gt;Sliba, 95 (Arabic)&lt;/ref&gt;

The bishop Sabrisho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}} of Balad was present at the consecration of the patriarch {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Abdisho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}} II (1074–90), and was later consecrated metropolitan of {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Ilam by the same patriarch.&lt;ref&gt;Mari, 130 (Arabic), 114–15 (Latin)&lt;/ref&gt;

An unnamed bishop of Balad was present at the consecration of the patriarch Bar Sawma in 1134.&lt;ref&gt;Mari, 154 (Arabic), 131 (Latin)&lt;/ref&gt;

The bishop Shem{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}on 'of Balad and al-Jaslona (Gaslona)' was present at the consecration of the patriarch [[Yahballaha III]] in 1281.&lt;ref&gt;Sliba, 124 (Arabic)&lt;/ref&gt;

The bishop Shem{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}on of Balad was present at the consecration of the patriarch [[Timothy II (Nestorian Patriarch)|Timothy II]] in 1318.&lt;ref&gt;Assemani, ''BO'', iii. i. 567–80&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diocese of Shigar ==
{{Main|Shigar (East Syrian Diocese)}}
The [[Shigar (East Syrian Diocese)|Diocese of Shigar]] was founded in the sixth century, probably to counter the growing influence of the Jacobites in the Sinjar region.  The full name of the diocese was Shigar and Beth {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Arabaye, and it covered the desert region to the north of Sinjar, where there were several Nestorian monasteries.  Six Nestorian bishops of Shigar are attested between the sixth and the fourteenth centuries.  The first of these bishops, Bawai, is mentioned in 563.  The last, Yohannan, was present at the consecration of the patriarch Timothy II in 1318.&lt;ref&gt;Fiey, ''POCN'', 134&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is not clear when the diocese of Shigar came to an end.  The Shigar region seems to have had a small Nestorian community up to the seventeenth century, and may even have had a bishop from time to time.  A metropolitan 'Glanan Imech' (possibly Maran{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}emmeh), of 'Sciugar' is mentioned in the report of 1607, and may have been a bishop of Shigar.  According to a [[Yazidi]] tradition, the last Nestorian 'metropolitan' of Sinjar died around 1660, and the region's few remaining Nestorian Christians become Yazidis.   It is difficult to say whether there is any truth in this tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Guest, ''Yezidis'', 52&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diocese of Beth Tabyathe and the Kartawaye ==
The bishop Klilisho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}} of 'Beth Tabyathe and the Kartawaye' was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Isho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}yahb I in 585.&lt;ref&gt;Chabot, 423&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diocese of Qarta and Adarma ==
The diocese of Qarta and Adarma was listed as a suffragan diocese in the province of Nisibis in the ''Mukhtasar'' of 1007/8, and a bishop Mushe of Qarta and Adarma is attested during the reign of the catholicus Eliya II (1111–32).  A ritual for the consecration of the bishop of Qarta and Adarma has survived in the works of the patriarch Eliya III (1176–90).  Finally, a manuscript was copied in 1186 in the monastery of Mar Awgin near Nisibis for the village of Tel Mahmad 'in the diocese of Qarta'.  Its colophon mentions that the manuscript was copied in the time of the patriarch Eliya III and the metropolitan Yahballaha of Nisibis, providing further confirmation that Qarta was a diocese in the province of Nisibis.&lt;ref&gt;MS Mosul (Scher) 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Qarta has been identified by [[Jean Maurice Fiey|Fiey]] with the monastery of Mar Gabrona and Mar Shmona (Arabic: Dayr al-Qara) near the Lailah Dagh, twenty kilometres to the southeast of Gazarta, and Adarma with the small town of Adarma, seventy kilometres east of Nisibis, near the modern Tel Rmelan al-Kabir.  The seat of the bishops of Qarta and Adarma may have been the monastery of Gabrona and Shmona, mentioned in the colophons of manuscripts of 1213/4 and 1217/8.&lt;ref&gt;Fiey, ''Nisibe'', 251–2; ''POCN'', 120–1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diocese of Armenia==
{{Main|Armenia (East Syrian Diocese)}}
The [[Nestorian diocese of Armenia]], whose bishops sat in the town of Halat ([[Ahlat]]) on the northern shore of Lake Van, is attested between the fifth and fourteenth centuries.  In the fifth century the diocese of Halat was not assigned to a metropolitan province, but was later included in the province of Nisibis, probably shortly after the Arab conquest.  The patriarch Timothy I created a metropolitan province for Armenia, presumably by raising the status of the diocese of [[Ahlat|Halat]].  By the second half of the eleventh century [[Ahlat|Halat]] was once again a suffragan diocese of the province of Nisibis.  By the thirteenth century the jurisdiction of the bishops of [[Ahlat|Halat]] included the towns of Van and Wastan.&lt;ref&gt;Fiey, ''POCN'', 47–8, 53 and 58–9&lt;/ref&gt;

== The diocese of Qaimar ==
An unnamed bishop of Qaimar was present at the consecration of the patriarch Bar Sawma in 1134.&lt;ref&gt;Mari, 154 (Arabic), 131 (Latin)&lt;/ref&gt;

The bishop Sabrisho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}} of Qaimar was transferred to the diocese of [[Kashkar (East Syrian Diocese)|Kashkar]] by the patriarch Eliya III (1176–90).&lt;ref&gt;Sliba, 111 (Arabic)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diocese of Hesna d'Kifa ==
A diocese was founded around the middle of the thirteenth century to the north of the Tur {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Abdin for the town of [[Hesna d'Kifa]].

The bishop Eliya of Hesna d'Kifa was present at the enthronement of [[Makkikha II]] in 1257.&lt;ref&gt;Sliba, 120 (Arabic)&lt;/ref&gt;

The bishop Emmanuel of Hesna d’Kifa was present at the consecration of the patriarch [[Yahballaha III]] in 1281.&lt;ref&gt;Sliba, 124 (Arabic)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Unspecified sees ==
The unperfected bishop Ibn Fadala, 'guardian of the throne of Nisibis' and bishop of an unnamed diocese in the province of Nisibis, was present together with the metropolitan Yohannan of Nisibis at the consecration of the patriarch [[Abdisho III|{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Abdisho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}} III]] in 1139.  He was required to proclaim the patriarch's name in the traditional ceremony in the church of Mar Pethion, 'because all the bishops of the great eparchy [Beth Aramaye] had died, and their thrones were vacant; something which had never happened before'.&lt;ref&gt;Mari, 157 (Arabic), 133 (Latin)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Campaignbox Iran-Iraq War}}
'''Operation Dawn 3''' or '''Operation Valfajr-3''' was Iran's worst defeat out of all the Dawn operations. 180,000 Iranian troops participated in this attack but withering Iraqi firepower in support of deeply entrenched troops slaughtered the advancing Iranians. Although Iranian troops were highly motivated, they were poorly trained and equipped for this battle. For Iran the operation was a disaster.

The Iraqis struck back by emerging from their trenches to counterattack into [[Iran]] and capture [[Mehran, Ilam Province|Mehran]], for the second time. 
==Battle==
The Iranians attempted to further exploit activities in the north after [[Operation Dawn 2]] on 30 July 1983. Iran saw an opportunity to sweep away Iraqi forces controlling the roads between the Iranian controlled mountain border towns of Mehran, Dehloran and Elam. Iraq conducted airstrikes against 50,000 Iranian forces lodged in mountainous terrain, exhausting themselves attempting to dislodge the Iranians. Realising they needed to alter their tactics, Iraq equipped attack helicopters with chemical warheads; while ineffective, it demonstrated both the Iraqi general staff's and Saddam's increasing interest in using chemical weapons. In the end, in total 17,000 soldiers had lost their lives,[clarification needed] with no gain for either country.[73]

The '''Pompeian Era''' was a [[calendar era]] used by [[Hellenistic]] cities in [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], in particular the [[city|cities]] of the [[Decapolis]].  The calendar counted the years from the region's conquest by the Roman general [[Pompey]] in 63 BCE.  Many of these cities had been self-governing ''[[polis|poleis]]'' before the [[Judaism|Jewish]] [[Hasmonean]]s had conquered them in the 2nd century BCE.  The Romans restored their self-governing status, so the conquest amounted to a "new foundation" of the cities, and they made that date the [[Epoch (reference date)|epochal year]] of their calendars.&lt;ref&gt;Kasher, Aryeh (1990).  ''Jews and Hellenistic Cities in Eretz-Israel''.  Mohr Siebeck, 131.  {{ISBN|3-16-145241-0}}.  [[Google Book Search]], https://books.google.com/books?id=SNfZ4OjH_ukC.  Accessed 26 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Some other nearby cities, such as [[Amman|Philadelphia]], adopted the era even though they had never been under Hasmonean rule.&lt;ref&gt;Kasher, 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

When archaeologists find Pompeian dates on a city's coins and inscriptions, they use them as evidence of the city's membership in the Decapolis league.  However, some cities that ancient writers listed in the Decapolis did not use Pompeian dates.  In particular, [[Damascus]] continued to reckon dates using the [[Seleucid era]].&lt;ref&gt;Smallwood, Mary (2001).  ''The Jews Under Roman Rule: From Pompey to Diocletian : A Study in Political Relations.''  BRILL, 29n.  {{ISBN|0-391-04155-X}}.  [[Google Book Search]], https://books.google.com/books?id=jSYbpitEjggC.  Accessed 26 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The region continued to use the Pompeian era during the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] period, long after the term "Decapolis" had fallen out of use.  The calendar was used even after the [[Muslim conquest of Syria]] in the 7th century CE.  A church in [[Khilda]], near Philadelphia ([[Amman]]), is inscribed with the Pompeian year 750, or 687 [[Common Era|CE]], several years after the Muslim conquest.&lt;ref&gt;Najjar, M. and Said, F. (1995).  ''A New Umayyad Church at Khilda – Amman''.  Online: http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/sbf/Books/LA44/44547MN.pdf.  Accessed 26 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6912">'''Prompt-launch''' status and '''delayed launch''' status are generic classifications of [[combat readiness]] applied to describe [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]]-armed missiles.

==Prompt-launch vs delayed launch==
[[File:Minuteman3launch.jpg|thumb|Almost all deployed U.S. nuclear-armed missiles, such as the [[Minuteman III]] (''pictured''), are kept at a prompt-launch status.]]
Prompt-launch, colloquially known as "hair trigger alert", is a state of combat readiness during which nuclear-armed missiles can be launched immediately upon receipt of a firing order, with no or minimal preparations.&lt;ref name="is"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coté|first1=Owen|title=The Trident and the Triad: Collecting the D-5 Dividend|journal=[[international Security (journal)|International Security]]|date=1991|volume=16|issue=2|pages=117–145|jstor=2539062}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keeping weapons systems at a prompt-launch status allows a nation-state to [[launch on warning]], thereby increasing the likelihood it could successfully retaliate against an attack, or initiate a nuclear first strike without alerting an enemy. Even for states that have proscribed launch on warning or first strike, prompt launch may help guarantee that nuclear-armed missiles which themselves have survived a first strike could actually be fired in a timely manner before being destroyed in follow-on, "mop-up" attacks.&lt;ref name="is"/&gt;

During delayed launch status, nuclear-armed missiles require some type of preparation prior to firing, such as fueling, warhead mounting, or the manual removal of static launch barriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=President-elect Trump's Nuclear Agenda: Modernization and More|url=http://www.nti.org/analysis/atomic-pulse/president-elect-trumps-nuclear-agenda-modernization-and-more/|website=nti.org|publisher=[[Nuclear Threat Initiative]]|accessdate=January 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In nuclear warfighting strategy, weapons kept at delayed launch status are at risk of being destroyed in their silos in the event of a nuclear [[first strike]] by an adversary. Even if weapons survive a first strike, a nation's command and control system may collapse by the time they are readied for firing. A 1993 analysis of future improvements in U.S. command and control predicted the United States government might only be able to continue operating for a few hours after an initial attack and would be unable to manage a "protracted" nuclear war, rendering surviving weapons kept in delayed launch status useless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Derber|first1=Charles|title=The Nuclear Seduction: Why the Arms Race Doesn't Matter - And What Does|date=1993|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0520082834|pages=233–234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of keeping some or all of a nation's nuclear deterrent at delayed alert status note several benefits, including decreased risk of accidental launch and minimized cost of crewing.

[[Submarine-launched ballistic missiles]] (SLBMs), when deployed aboard [[ballistic missile submarine]]s, are generally not vulnerable to an enemy's own weapons and may be kept at delayed launch status without risking their future launch potential. However, methods for keeping ICBMs at a delayed launch status, such as warhead-missile separation or placing static launch barriers on silo doors, may not be possible in the case of SLBMs due to the nature of submarine-deployment. Several methods have been proposed by which SLBMs could be kept at a delayed launch status, such as deploying ballistic missile submarines in remote oceanic locations out-of-range of the nation's primary adversary.

'''Scipio Kennedy''' (c. 1694&amp;ndash;1774) was a slave taken as a child from [[Guinea (region)|Guinea]] in West Africa. After being purchased at the age of five or six by [[Douglas of Mains|Captain Andrew Douglas of Mains]], he served as a slave under his daughter, [[Lady Jean Kennedy|Lady Jean]], wife of Sir John, the [[Kennedy baronets#Kennedy baronets.2C of Culzean .281682.29|2nd Baronet Kennedy]] of [[Culzean Castle|Culzean]] in [[Ayrshire]]. He was granted a [[manumission]] (freedom from slavery) in 1725, but continued to work for the Kennedy family and was given land on the estate.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news|title=Dig for freed slave's castle home|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/7063851.stm|date=26 October 2007|accessdate=29 December 2014|work=BBC News Glasgow and West|agency=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; He married in 1728 and had at least eight children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Slavery, the transatlantic slave trade and Scotland|url=http://www.nas.gov.uk/guides/slavetrade.asp#prominentslaves|website=National Archives of Scotland|publisher=National Records of Scotland|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least one living descendant is known from the West of Scotland and has published the story of his ancestor in a Scottish national newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case Study: Searching for Scipio|url=http://www.scottishheritagehub.com/content/case-study-searching-scipio|publisher=Scottish Archeological Research Framework|accessdate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==African slaves in Scotland==
The commercial success of the [[slave labour|slave-worked]] [[Plantation economy#Slavery|plantations]] of the late seventeenth century led to a fashion for Scottish families of the [[gentry]] class to keep black African servants. Merchants importing goods from the Caribbean and Americas made regular contact with [[slave ships]] and some were "redeemed" (purchased) for [[domestic service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Black Servants in Ayrshire|url=http://www.ayrshirearchives.org.uk/exhibition/blackhist/blackhist1.htm|website=Ayrshire Archives|publisher=Ayrshire councils|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Men and boys were more likely than women and girls to be taken into service, often in highly visible roles such as [[page (servant)|page boy]]s or [[footman|footmen]]. They might be given pet names, or names that sarcastically poked fun at their powerlessness, such as "Caesar".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LR2 – Slavery in the Caribbean Topic 7 Slave names and identities|url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/slavery/pdf/Topic7-LR2-SlaveryintheCaribbean.pdf|publisher=[[University of Aberdeen]]|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their lives were often much easier than that of their counterparts in the New World plantations, and they were often given an education so that they could read and write.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Slave Trade|url=http://www.nts.org.uk/Learn/slave_trade_enslaved.php|publisher=[[National Trust for Scotland]]|accessdate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They were also expected to become Christians and therefore after their baptism, they became recognised as having a soul. By the end of the eighteenth century, they were seen as equal human beings under the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Slavery, the transatlantic slave trade and Scotland|url=http://www.nas.gov.uk/guides/slavetrade.asp#court|website=National Archives of Scotland|publisher=National Records of Scotland|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scipio's journey to Ayrshire==
In about the year 1700, when Scipio was aged five or six, he was captured in West Africa and taken onto a slave ship in the area known as the Gulf of Guinea. Given the normal route that these ships took, it is likely that he was transported to an island in the Caribbean before being redeemed by Andrew Douglas of Mains (which is near [[Milngavie]] in [[Dumbartonshire]]) and transported to Scotland in 1702. Douglas would probably have chosen the name Scipio, whose namesake [[Scipio Africanus]] served the [[Roman Empire]], defeating the numerically superior forces of [[Hannibal]] in the [[Punic Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scipio Kennedy and Culzean|url=http://www.nts.org.uk/Learn/adult_hidden_scipioculzean.php|publisher=National Trust for Scotland|accessdate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Douglas had a daughter, Jean, who married John Kennedy in 1705, and Scipio moved to Culzean with them. During this time Scipio learned to read, write and also some textile manufacture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Case Study: Searching for Scipio {{!}} ScARF|url = http://www.scottishheritagehub.com/content/case-study-searching-scipio|website = www.scottishheritagehub.com|accessdate = 2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1711, John Kennedy assumed the title of Baronet Kennedy of Culzean from his father, the first Baronet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cassillis, Earl of (S, 1509)|url=http://www.cracroftspeerage.co.uk/online/content/cassillis1509.htm|publisher=Cracroft's Peerage|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life after freedom==
Scipio's manumission document is held at the National Archives of Scotland. It is dated 1725 and grants Scipio the freedom to take employment elsewhere. The document records the "clothing, maintenance and education with more than ordinary kindness" already given to Scipio by the Kennedy family. It also details the terms of his further employment by them in a nineteen-year breakable contract, to be rewarded with "the sum of twelve pounds Scots money yearly besides my share of the drink money".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Judge and Jurist: Essays in Memory of Lord Rodger of Earlsferry|editor1=Andrew Burrows|editor2=David Johnston, QC|editor3=Reinhard Zimmermann|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2013|pages=372–73|chapter=Freeing from Slavery in Eighteenth Century Scotland|last=Cairns|first=John W}}&lt;/ref&gt; The document is signed by John Kennedy and Scipio.&lt;ref name=Sharp&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sharp|first1=Jonathan|title=How family tree search revealed slavery roots in 18th-century Ayrshire|url=http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/how-family-tree-search-revealed-slavery-roots-in-18th-century-ayrshire-1-2277538|accessdate=30 December 2014|newspaper=The Scotsman|date=6 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NTSAdultLearning&gt;{{cite web|title=Hidden Histories &amp;ndash; Scotland and the Slave Trade|url=http://www.nts.org.uk/learn/downloads/Hidden_Histories.pdf|publisher=National Trust for Scotland|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1728 Scipio was recorded as having fathered a daughter, Elizabeth, by [[fornication]] with Margaret Gray. This would have been considered a scandalous event within the parish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Compendium of the Laws of the Church of Scotland.|date=1837|pages=390–391|edition=2nd|url=https://archive.org/stream/compendiumoflaws00steu#page/390/mode/2up|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scipio married Margaret later that year and the couple had seven &lt;ref&gt;Kirkoswald Parish Register, Minutes of Kirkoswald Sessions&lt;/ref&gt;further children.&lt;ref name=Rice&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rice|first1=Alan|title=Radical Narratives of the Black Atlantic|date=2003|isbn=0826456065|pages=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scipio's house==
An estate map was drawn up in the 1750s by John Foulis of Redburn, a copy of which is kept in Culzean Castle. The map shows a building on a piece of land about 800 metres from the castle, near to the current walled garden, and it is overwritten with the word "Sipios".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jackson|first1=Debbie|title=A History of Culzean Castle Gardens, Ayrshire 1597 &amp;ndash; 1846|publisher=[[University of St Andrews]]|page=21|url=https://www.academia.edu/597479/A_History_of_Culzean_Castle_Gardens_Ayrshire_1597_-_1846|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The house cost £90 to build when new, and was probably an impressive building made of stone. The area of the grounds where the house once stood was excavated in 2007; some artifacts were found during the excavation which may have been Scipio's personal property.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

==Lady Jean's will==
Jean Kennedy's will dated 1751, records the gift from her estate "to Scipio Kennedy my old servant, the sum of ten pounds sterling". As this figure is of a similar order to the amount given to each of her grandchildren (a third each of £40), this seems to show that Scipio was considered to be part of the Kennedy family.&lt;ref name=NTSAdultLearning/&gt;

==Memorial stone==
In Kirkoswald Old Church graveyard, there is a stone commemorating the life of Scipio, erected by one of his sons. The stone does not explicitly say that Scipio is buried in that place, but that his son is "also" buried there. The stone reads:
:''This stone is erected by Douglas Kennedy in Memory of his father Scipio Kennedy who died June 24, 1774 Aged 80 years.''
:''Also here lieth the body of said Douglas Kennedy who died July 21, 1781 aged 49 years.''&lt;ref name=Rice/&gt; 
The text at the bottom reads "1 length and 1 breadth" and is not part of the inscription, but is to define the burial plot.

==Descendants==
Some authors have raised the question of Scipio's descendants.&lt;ref name=Rice/&gt; In May 2012, ''[[The Scotsman]]'' published an article written by Jonathan Sharp, which details his personal research into his family history. He traced his lineage back through to one of Scipio's daughters, Elizabeth Kennedy in Kirkoswald, and thence to Scipio himself.&lt;ref name=Sharp/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5486">'''Sulcard''' (floruit ''c''. 1080) was a Benedictine monk at St. Peter's, [[Westminster Abbey]], and the author of the first history of the abbey.

Little is known of Sulcard, whose unusual name may reflect either Anglo-Saxon or Norman parentage.&lt;ref name=Harvey&gt;Harvey, "Sulcard (''fl. c.'' 1080)."&lt;/ref&gt; His entrance into the monastery may be dated to the 1050s and it is possible that he was previously attached to the [[Rochester Cathedral|cathedral priory at Rochester]], which receives a noticeable degree of attention in his work.&lt;ref name=Harvey/&gt;

==''Prologus de Construccione Westmonasterii''==
[[File:Westminster Abbey cloister.jpg|thumb|325px|right|The present-day cloister of Westminster Abbey]]

The sole work which Sulcard is known to have produced is the so-called ''Prologus de Construccione Westmonasterii'' (“Prologue concerning the Building  of Westminster”), dedicated to Abbot [[Vitalis of Bernay]] (''c''. 1076—?1085) and hence datable to about 1080.&lt;ref&gt;Barlow, ''The Life of King Edward who Rests at Westminster'', p. xxxvi and xxxvi note 100.&lt;/ref&gt; It relates the history of the abbey, beginning in the time of [[Mellitus]], bishop of London (604—17), with the foundation of its first church on what was then [[Thorney Island (London)|Thorney Island]] by a wealthy Londoner and his wife. It concludes with the dedication of a new church erected by King [[Edward the Confessor]] (r. 1042—1066) for the monastery. In the dedication to Vitalis, Sulcard writes that he intended his work to serve as a ‘commemorative book’ (''codex memorialis'') for his house. He was primarily interested in promoting the cult of [[St. Peter]], the abbey’s patron saint, who is said to have miraculously appeared in the early 7th century to dedicate the church in person. Two copies of the history are extant, the earliest being a chartulary from Winchester (''c''. 1300), BL, [[Cotton MS Faustina]] A.iii, fols. 11r—16v. The other copy is in BL, Cotton MS Titus A.viii, fols. 2r–5v. The title is not contemporary, but derives from the heading in the former chartulary, to which it serves as a prologue.&lt;ref&gt;The full title reads: ''Hic incipit Prologus de prima constructione ecclesie Westmonasterii et de dedicatione loci eiusdem per sanctum Petrum apostolorum principem''. [http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/cotton/mss/tit1.htm HRI online].&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from relating local traditions about St. Peter's marvellous involvement, the narrative of Sulcard’s ''Prologus'' is relatively free of embroidery.&lt;ref name=Harvey/&gt; It is valuable for casting some light on the memory of Edward the Confessor within a few decades after the Conquest. He drew upon the anonymous ''[[Vita Ædwardi Regis]]'' ("Life of King Edward"), at least Book I, which survives only in a later revision, and so bears testimony to its existence no later than 1084/1085.&lt;ref name=Harvey/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barlow, ''The Life of King Edward who Rests at Westminster'', p. xxx.&lt;/ref&gt; Sulcard's copy may have been the same text that was used by [[Osbert de Clare]] in ''c''. 1138 and by the English historian [[Richard of Cirencester]] in the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;Barlow, ''The Life of King Edward who Rests at Westminster'', pp. xxxvii, xxxix, lxxx.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Osbert de Clare, who used the ''Prologus''&lt;ref&gt;Barlow, ''The Life of King Edward who Rests at Westminster'', pp. xxxvi-xxxvii.&lt;/ref&gt; and reworked Edward’s ''Vita'' in ''c''. 1138, Sulcard ascribes no miracles to Edward, suggesting that Westminster had not yet seen an active royal cult.&lt;ref name=Harvey/&gt; Edward's role in the ''Prologus'' is small by comparison, even if he is remembered as a magnificent ruler, as in the account of his death "when not only England but also all other neighbouring kingdoms gave way to tears".&lt;ref&gt;Barlow (ed. and tr.), ''The Life of King Edward who Rests at Westminster'', p. 114-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

A critical edition of the text based primarily on MS [[Cotton Faustina]] A.iii was published in 1964 by Bernard W. Scholz. Portions of the text which are relevant to the ''Vita Ædwardi Regis'' have been edited and translated by [[Frank Barlow (historian)|Frank Barlow]].

==Death and legacy==

Sulcard was later said to have been awarded the privilege of burial in the abbey’s cloister.&lt;ref name=Harvey/&gt; At the instigation of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] (r. 1216—1272), his remains were translated to the newly built chapter house of the abbey.&lt;ref name=Harvey/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scholz, "Sulcard of Westminster." p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Prologus'' continued to reach an audience throughout the Middle Ages and was extensively used by the monk [[John Flete]] (d. 1466) for his own ''History of Westminster Abbey''.&lt;ref name=Harvey/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5361">'''Uwe Topper''' (born 1940) is a German amateur researcher and author of books about historic, ethnographic and anthropological subjects.

In 1977 Topper published ''Das Erbe der Giganten'' (''The Legacy of the Giants''), a book about the prehistory of [[Spain]] and the Western Mediterranean basin. The main thesis interpretes the remnant of very early high cultures there as the basis for [[Plato]]'s [[Atlantis]]. Although this idea has not raised a broad echo in the mainstream research, his discoverings of rock paintings and engravings presented in the book have been favourably received and quoted by academic researchers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.almogaren.org/ic-digital/ICDigital_Almogaren_XXVIII-1_(1997).pdf Sexualität und Scham bei den Altkanariern] Hans-Joachim Ulbrich, in: Almogaren XXVIII/1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''La cueva del Tajo de las Figuras'', by Martí Mas Cornellá (UNED Ed. 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the late 1990s he is best known as a proponent of radically rewriting [[chronology]], with his variant of ''New Chronology'' somewhat between [[Heribert Illig]]'s [[phantom time hypothesis]] and [[New Chronology (Fomenko)|Fomenko's]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/2000/02/200002.l-glosse-albrech.xml Schluss mit lustig] by Jörg Albrecht in: Zeit Online. 5 January 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  
Apart from working on New Chronology Topper did extensive anthropologial research. 
His works in this field have been partially published in the yearbook of the German [[Institutum Canarium]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.almogaren.org/findex_d.html?/almo_contents_authors_d.html Almogaren]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in the yearbook of [[University of Cádiz]] (Spain). He has published scientific articles in German official reviews like ''Zeitschrift für Ethnologie'' and ''Jahrbuch des Museums für Anthropologie München''. His book on early metal age civilizations (''horra'') gives a new dimension to prehistoric research.&lt;ref&gt;The Beginning of the Metal Age, in: Migration and Diffusion vol. 4/no. 14 (Odyssee Editorial  2003) {{ISSN|1563-440X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Topper has also written about the [[Book of Revelation]] (''Das letzte Buch'', 1993), about [[Reincarnation]] beliefs from a historical and ethnological perspective (''Wiedergeburt'', 1988), [[Sufism]] in North Africa (''Sufis und Heilige im Maghreb'', 1984/1991) and popular traditions in Morocco.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilya.it/antropologo/Maerchenbuch.html Märchen der Berber] (German, translated into Italian and Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; He lives in [[Berlin]].

In 1995, Topper, who by then had got in contact with a group of German researchers including [[Gunnar Heinsohn]], [[Heribert Illig]], [[Christoph Marx]] and others, who all question the established chronology, decided to take a closer look at the [[Middle Ages]] and published a series of books which try to show that History, as we know it, was created from the 16th century onwards - according to this idea, there are hardly well-dated facts before 1400 AD. Titles include ''Die Große Aktion'' [''The Big Action''](1998) ''Erfundene Geschichte'' [''Invented History''](1999), ''Fälschungen der Geschichte'' [''Faked History''](2001), ''ZeitFälschung'' [''Faking Time''] (2003), several are translated into Russian, Hungarian, Bulgarian and Corean. His focus on falsifications in the Middle Ages and modern times raised interest in German press.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dradio.de/dlf/sendungen/langenacht_alt/020824.html Die Lange Nacht der Fälscher und Fälschungen] Deutschlandradio, 24 August 2002&lt;/ref&gt; His knowledge of [[Arabic]] and  [[Berber languages|Berber]] makes him focus especially on North African subjects.

'''William George Morgan''' (January 23, 1870 – December 27, 1942) was the inventor of [[volleyball]], originally called "Mintonette", a name derived from the game of [[badminton]]
which he later agreed to change to better reflect the nature of the sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.newenglandhistoricalsociety.com/15634-2/|title=In 1895, William Morgan Invents Mintonette|quote=Putting his mind to the challenge, Morgan examined the rules of sports such as baseball, basketball, handball and badminton. Taking pieces from each, he created a game he called Mintonette, deriving the name from badminton|publisher=New England Historical Society|access-date=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was born in [[Lockport (city), New York|Lockport, New York]], US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carl-leonard.com/tag/william-g-morgan/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427130130/http://carl-leonard.com/tag/william-g-morgan/ |archivedate=2014-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He met [[James Naismith]], inventor of basketball, while Morgan was studying at [[Springfield College]] in 1892. Like Naismith, Morgan pursued a career in [[Physical Education]] at the [[YMCA]]. Influenced by Naismith and basketball, in 1895, in [[Holyoke, Massachusetts]], Morgan invented "Mintonette" a less vigorous team sport more suitable for older members of the YMCA but one that still required athletic skill. Later Alfred S. Halstead watched it being played and renamed it "Volleyball", because the point of the game is to volley the ball back and forth over the net.

==Early life==
William George Morgan graduated high school at Northfield Mount Hermon School and moved on to attend the YMCA International Training School (Later renamed Springfield College) in Massachusetts with James Naismith, the inventor of basketball.&lt;ref name="fivb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fivb.org/thegame/Volleyball_Story.htm |title=The Game |website=Fivb.org |date= |accessdate=2017-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Morgan and Naismith pursued careers in Physical Education at the YMCA (Young Men’s Christian Association). Auburn, Maine, at the YMCA, was where Morgan spent one year working prior to graduating from Springfield College.&lt;ref name="www3.spfldcol.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.spfldcol.edu/homepage/dept.nsf/4E93DD891996606345256D1E002E387E/EA1E0D6275670763852571B7004AC029 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104233118/http://www3.spfldcol.edu/homepage/dept.nsf/4E93DD891996606345256D1E002E387E/EA1E0D6275670763852571B7004AC029 |archivedate=2013-11-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the summer of 1895, Morgan moved to Holyoke, Massachusetts, where he continued to work for the YMCA, becoming the Director of Physical Education.&lt;ref name="fivb"/&gt; With Morgan being the Director, it allowed him to devise workout plans and teach sports in depth to the young male adult.

==Creating the sport==
As William Morgan worked as the Director of Physical Education at the YMCA in Holyoke, he started to notice that the game of basketball was not meant for everyone to play. The weaker young men, non-athletic adults, and the older adults were not able to keep up with running up and down the court, along with the amount of contact they would occasionally run into.&lt;ref name="todayifoundout.cm"&gt;{{cite web|author=Daven Hiskey |url=http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2012/02/february-9th-william-g-morgan-invents-a-game-called-mintonette-that-is-better-known-today-as-volleyball/ |title=February 9th: William G. Morgan Invents a Game Called Mintonette that is Better Known Today as Volleyball |publisher=Todayifoundout.com |date=2012-02-09 |accessdate=2017-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan then had to think of a game in where everyone would have an equal amount of participation but also had similar objectives to basketball. He wanted to create a game which everyone could play, no matter their age or physical ability.

Between trying to run classes at the YMCA and creating a new sport suitable for all, Morgan decided it was best that he use ideas from various sports such as handball, tennis, and badminton, and his own knowledge from sports training methods and experience, to create this new sport.&lt;ref name="inventors.about.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bellis |first=Mary |url=http://inventors.about.com/od/uvstartinventions/a/Vollyball.htm |title=Invention and History of Volleyball by William Morgan |publisher=Inventors.about.com |date= |accessdate=2017-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He decided that the game would involve a six-foot, six-inch net in the middle dividing the 2 separate playing areas, and that it would be played on a 30&amp;nbsp;ft. × 60&amp;nbsp;ft. court, so that it could be played in gyms anywhere across the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsknowhow.com/volleyball/history/volleyball-history.shtml |title=VOLLEYBALL HISTORY- Page 1 of 2 &amp;#124; Court &amp; Field Dimension Diagrams in 3D, History, Rules |publisher=Sportsknowhow.com |date=2015-04-11 |accessdate=2017-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sportsknowhow.com/volleyball/dimensions/volleyball-court-dimensions.html |title=Volleyball Court Dimensions &amp;#124; Court &amp; Field Dimension Diagrams in 3D, History, Rules |publisher=Sportsknowhow.com |date=2015-04-11 |accessdate=2017-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After creating some ground rules, William Morgan had to experiment with his game. First, he had to decide which ball to use. A basketball was too heavy while the basketball bladder was too light. After testing all of the balls he had available, he had come to the conclusion that his best option was to ask A.G. Spalding &amp; Bros. to make him a ball. A young A.G. Spalding &amp; Bros. equipment designer and master marine cloth tailor, Dale Callaghan, developed and produced the first prototype volleyball. Morgan was very pleased with Spalding &amp; Bros. work. They created Morgan the perfect ball for his sport, which was covered in leather, with the circumference of 25–27 inches. The ball was also the perfect weight for Morgan's sport. The ball weighed 9–12 ounces. This new ball that had been made for Morgan's sport was the perfect finishing touch to the basics of the sport. The last thing that had to be done by Morgan was to create a name. Morgan came up with "Mintonette" as the new name for his game.&lt;ref name="fivb" /&gt;

==Introducing the sport==
The first time Morgan revealed his sport to the other Directors of Physical was at the YMCA located in Springfield, in 1896. He presented his new, creative idea to Dr. Luther Halsey Gulick (director of the professional physical education training school) and the rest of the YMCA Directors of Physical Education. Dr. Gulick was so pleased that he asked Morgan to present his sport at the school's new stadium.

In preparation for his big debut, Morgan created 2 teams of 5 men, who would help in demonstrating “Mintonette” in front of the conference delegates in the East Gymnasium at Springfield College.

On February 9, 1895, William Morgan presented his new sport to the world. When Morgan was explaining the game before the demonstration, he named a few key guidelines in the game of “Mintonette” such as that the game was created so that it could be played in open air and in gyms as well as the objective of the game was to keep the ball in action as it goes from one side of the high net, to the other.

One of the conference delegates, Professor Alfred T. Halsted, loved the game of Mintonette, but he felt like something was just not right. Professor Halsted suggested that the name of the game should be Volleyball, since the main point of the game was to “volley” the ball to a player or over the net. Morgan agreed with Halsted's idea and since then the original game of “Mintonette” has been referred to as Volleyball.

Morgan continued to tweak the rules of the game until July 1896, where his sport was added into the first official handbook of the North American YMCA Athletic League.

==Aftermath==
On July 7, 1896, the first game of volleyball was played at Springfield College.&lt;ref name="todayifoundout.cm" /&gt;
*In 1900, Spalding started to produce a special ball, which was designed specifically for the sport – A volleyball.&lt;ref name="volleyball.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volleyball.com/volleyball_history.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070924042339/http://www.volleyball.com/volleyball_history.aspx |archivedate=2007-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1920, new rules were instigated which included the three hits per side and the back row attack rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.athleticscholarships.net/history-of-volleyball.htm |title=The History Of Volleyball. Where Volleyball Started |website=Athleticscholarships.net |date= |accessdate=2017-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1964, at the Summer Olympic Games in Tokyo, was where Volleyball was introduced to the Olympics.&lt;ref name="volleyball.com"/&gt;

==Later life==
William Morgan left his job at the YMCA in 1897 to start a new career with General Electric and Westinghouse. He stayed in touch with Springfield College and stated that he was "content in the knowledge that the game brought a richer life to millions of people throughout the world."&lt;ref name="www3.spfldcol.edu"/&gt;

Morgan died on December 27, 1942.

==Credits==
In 1995, The Morgan Trophy Award was created. The Award is presented annually to the most outstanding male and female collegiate volleyball player in the US.&lt;ref name="inventors.about.com"/&gt;
An elementary school in Holyoke, William Morgan School, bears his name.
