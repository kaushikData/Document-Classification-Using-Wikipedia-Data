'''Adrestia''' ([[Ancient Greek]]: Ἀδρήστεια) in [[Greek mythology]] "she who cannot be escaped" is the daughter of [[Ares]] and [[Aphrodite]] and known to accompany her father Ares to war. She was venerated as a goddess of revolt, just retribution and  sublime balance between good and evil. Because of her role in revenge and retribution, she was usually portrayed with [[Nemesis (mythology)|Nemesis]], and sometimes identical to Nemesis herself, who had the epithet of [[Adrasteia|Adrestia or Adrasteia]]. She was also believed to be another war figure, similar to her brothers [[Phobos (mythology)|Phobos]] and [[Deimos (mythology)|Deimos]].

{{quote|"She whom none can escape". Properly an epithet of [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]] [[Cybele]] in her attribute of the Mother who punishes human injustice, which is a transgression of the natural right order of things. The Greeks and Romans identified her with Nemesis.|Micha F. Lindemans}}

The union between Ares and Aphrodite produced many children: [[Eros]] (the god of love), [[Anteros]] (the god of requited love), Phobos (the god of fear), Deimos (the god of terror) and [[Harmonia (mythology)|Harmonia]] (the goddess of harmony and concord), besides Adrestia herself.  Gods would try to get on her side and she would be fought over by the gods and titans.

Also called 'Araijan Kodi'. It is made of gold, silver or thick thread. The primary purpose is to measure the healthy growth of an infant by the increase of the waistline. Aranjanam can also fasten the cloth on the waist, similar to women using it to secure the folds of a sari. It is possible that some parents also believe that it will safeguard against evil spirits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uyirmmai.com/Uyirosai/ContentDetails.aspx?cid=80|title=தமிழின் முதன்மையான முன்னணி கலை- இலக்கிய, சமூகவியல்|website=www.uyirmmai.com|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although in India, most women and many men continue to wear them as adults as well.

Ancient [[Tamil people]] used it, mentioned in [[Tolkappiyam]], [[Sangam literature]] describes the usage of Araijan by the words ''வெண்ஞான்'' (Venjan - made of silver) and ''பொன்ஞான்'' (Ponjan - made of gold).

Pseudo-scientific Reason
Apart from Gold / Silver the rope has a "Thayathu" a small capsule made of gold or silver to hold the umbilical chord dried and stored in sealed format inside it. In modern day science we call these cells as stem cells which can help in curing many disease and tissue replacements as those cells are available only during child birth and preserved for a fee in modern hospitals.

This is pseudo science because modern science has determined that these cells need to be preserved in their “alive” and “able to multiply” state in order to be used in stem cell therapy. Dried and powdered cells are of no medicinal value and are a placebo along the lines of rhinos horns which are believed to have medicinal value elsewhere.

== Aranjanam Kettal ==
[[File:Golden Aranjanam.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Aranjanam Kettal in Kerala]]
In Kerala, This ceremony is performed on the 28th day after birth of the child, as this is the first time the nakshatram (star) of the child repeats according to the Malayalam calendar. During the ceremony, charadu (thread), one in black cotton and the other a chain in gold are intertwined and tied around the waist of the child - this is usually done by the father of the child. This thread is called 'Aranjanam'. The child's eyes are lined with mayye or kanmashi (Kohl). A black spot is placed on one cheek or asymmetrically on the forehead, to ward off the evil eyes. The father whispers the chosen Hindu name in the child's right ear three times while the left ear is covered with a betel leaf. This is then repeated with the left ear. A mixture of ghee (melted and clarified butter) and honey is given to the infant as a base for its various foods in the future.

==History and Studies==
Devaraj schooled at the local [[USPG|S.P.G.]] School in [[Nandyal]] and then went on to graduate from the [[Noble College]] in [[Machilipatnam]] in 1920 where he took a B.A.&lt;ref name="Constance"/&gt; He also studied for an M.A. at the [[Madras University]] in 1929, eventually became principal of a Training School in [[Nandyal]].&lt;ref name="Constance"/&gt;

During 1946-1947, Devaraj attended a special course&lt;ref&gt;The United Theological College, Directory 1910-1997, Bengaluru, 1997.  p.90.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=yCvXPgAACAAJ&amp;dq]&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[United Theological College (Bangalore)|United Theological College]], [[Bengaluru]] and was ordained as an Anglican Priest in 1948.&lt;ref name="Constance"/&gt;

==Reminisce==
Talathoti Punnaiah who studied a 3-year theology course leading to [[Bachelor of Theology]] at the [[Andhra Christian Theological College]], both at [[Rajahmundry]] and at [[Hyderabad]] from 1970-1973 recalls his association with B. E. Devaraj,
{{quote|Devaraj was [[Bursar]] of the College and a senior most among the faculty hailing from an [[Anglican]] background, very active and healthy.  He was very good in Telugu and composed the Hymn 484 appearing in the Christian Hymnal in Telugu.  He was very particular in grammar pronunciation.  As I studied in [[Madras]] and had Tamil slang, I was afraid to read the Telugu book in the class.  Later on, I understood the importance of Telugu language through his Telugu class and I improved my Telugu vocabulary, expression and accent.&lt;ref&gt;Talathoti Punnaiah, ''My Memoir, Ministry and Message: (60 years Life Experiences 1950-2010)'', Kakinada, 2010, pp.18-19.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Lashari won awards in four categories at the [[ARY Film Awards 2014]] for his directorial debut.&lt;ref name="1st ARYFA"&gt;{{cite news|author=Saira Agha|title=‘Waar’ dominates ARY Film Awards with 13 major wins|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/entertainment/30-Apr-2014/waar-dominates-ary-film-awards-with-13-major-wins|accessdate=28 May 2014|newspaper=Daily Times|date=30 April 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141226094047/http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/entertainment/30-Apr-2014/waar-dominates-ary-film-awards-with-13-major-wins|archivedate=26 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life &amp; career ==
Lashari was born into a [[Baloch people|Baloch]] family. His father, Kamran Lashari, is a retired senior Pakistani bureaucrat who served as [[Petroleum Secretary of Pakistan]] and did a lot in cultural preservation, while his paternal grandfather was a landlord, lawyer and poet.&lt;ref&gt;[https://insidelahore.com/kamran-man-who-kept-culture-alive/ Kamran Lashari, The man who kept our Culture Alive]&lt;/ref&gt; His younger brother, Rohail Lashari, has been the lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist for the [[Lahore]]-based band ''Jhol'' (2010-2015), was "in charge" of the seventh season of [[Coke Studio Pakistan]] as well as a [[MBA]] graduate from [[HEC Paris]], while another younger brother, Omar Lashari, is a [[Cornell]]-educated financial analyst.&lt;ref&gt;Rohail Lashari (18 January 2018), [https://blogs.tribune.com.pk/story/62639/i-wanted-to-earn-the-lashari-surname-and-studying-abroad-in-hec-paris-helped-me-achieve-just-that/ "I wanted to earn the ‘Lashari’ surname, and studying abroad in HEC Paris helped me achieve just that!"], ''[[The Express Tribune]]''. Retrieved 05 August 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Lashari grew up in Pakistan, attending local schools. He went to the [[United States of America]] for college, studying at the [[Academy of Art University]] in [[San Francisco, California]], where he earned a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts|Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA)]] in Motion Pictures and Television in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://blogs.academyart.edu/newspaper/2015/12/9.html |title = Bringing Pakistan's Film Style to the World Stage - Academy of Art University |date =9 December 2015 |accessdate = 11 December 2016 |website = academyart.edu |publisher = [[Academy of Art University]]|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his return to Pakistan, Lashari first directed music videos, and won 'Best Music Video Director' twice at the [[Lux Style Awards]] and ‘Best Pop Video’ at the [[MTV Pakistan]] Music Video Awards for “Sajni”.  He has also directed “Chal Bulleya” for Meekal Hassan Band. He has worked with artists and bands such as [[Abrarul Haq]], [[Atif Aslam]], Mekaal Hassan Band, [[Jal (band)|Jal]] and [[Entity Paradigm]]. He also directed the video “Chal Bulleya” for Meekal Hassan Band.

In 2004 Lashari briefly worked as assistant director for [[Shoaib Mansoor]] during pre-production of ''[[Khuda Kay Liye]]'' in 2004.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4466">In the [[biology|biological]] sciences, the term '''''bow tie''''' (so called for its shape) is a recent concept that tries to grasp the essence of some operational and functional structures observed in biological organisms and other kinds of [[Complexity|complex]] and [[self-organizing]] systems. In general, bow tie architectures refer to ordered and recurrent structures that often underlie complex technological or biological systems, and that are capable of conferring them a balance among efficiency, robustness and evolvability. In other words, bow ties are able to take into account a great diversity of inputs (fanning in to the knot), showing a much smaller diversity in the protocols and processes (the ''knot'') able to elaborate these inputs, and finally an extremely heterogeneous diversity of outputs (fanning out of the bowtie). These architectures thus manage a wide range of inputs through a ''core'' (knot) constituted by a limited number of elements. In such structures, inputs are conveyed into a sort of funnel, towards a "[[:wikt:synthesis|synthesis]]" [[wikt:core|core]], where they can be duly organized, processed and managed by means of protocols [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/protocol], and from where, in turn, a variety of outputs, or responses, is propagated.

[[image:general bowtie architecture.png|thumb|scheme of a general bow tie architecture]]
According to Csete and Doyle,&lt;ref name="pmid15331224"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Csete M, Doyle J | title = Bow ties, metabolism and disease | journal = Trends Biotechnol | volume = 22 | issue = 9 | pages = 446–50 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15331224 | doi = 10.1016/j.tibtech.2004.07.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; bow ties are able to optimally organize fluxes of mass, energy, signals in an overall structure that forcedly deals with a highly fluctuating and "sloppy" environment. In a biological perspective, a bow tie manages a large ''fan in'' of stimuli (input), it accounts for a "compressed" ''core'', and it expresses again a large ''fan out'' of possible [[phenotypes]], [[metabolite]] products, or –more generally – reusable [[modules]]. Bow tie architectures have been observed in the structural organization at different scales of living and [[evolving]] organisms (e.g. bacterial [[metabolism]] network&lt;ref name="pmid15331224" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PMID12874056"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ma HW, Zeng AP | title = The connectivity structure, giant strong component and centrality of metabolic networks | journal = Bioinformatics | volume = 19 | issue = 11 | pages = 1423–30 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12874056 | doi = 10.1093/bioinformatics/btg177 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PMID16916470"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhao J, Yu H, Luo JH, Cao ZW, Li YX | title = Hierarchical modularity of nested bow-ties in metabolic networks | journal = BMC Bioinformatics | volume = 7 | pages = 386 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16916470 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2105-7-386 | pmc = 1560398 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) as well as in technological and [[dynamical systems]] (e.g. the Internet&lt;ref name=""&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Broder A, Kumar R, Maghoul F, Raghavan P, Rajagopalan S, Stata R, Tomkins A, Wiener J | author-link = Andrei Broder | author4-link = Prabhakar Raghavan | author6-link = Raymie Stata | title = Graph structure in the Web | journal = Computer Networks | volume = 33 | issue = 1-6 | pages = 309–20 | year = 2000 | doi = 10.1016/S1389-1286(00)00083-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). Bow ties seem to be able to mediate trade-offs among [[Mutational robustness|robustness]] and efficiency, at the same time assuring to the system the capability to evolve.
Conversely, the same efficient architecture may be prone and vulnerable to fragilities due to specific changes, perturbations, and focused attacks directed against the core set of modules and protocols.
The bow tie architecture is one of several different structures and functioning principles that [[living matter]] employs to achieve [[self-organization]] and efficient exploitation of available resources.&lt;ref name="pmid20701759"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tieri P, Grignolio A, Zaikin A, Mishto M, Remondini D, Castellani GC, Franceschi C | title = Network, degeneracy and bow tie integrating paradigms and architectures to grasp the complexity of the immune system | journal = Theor Biol Med Model | volume = 7 | pages = 32 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20701759 | doi = 10.1186/1742-4682-7-32 | pmc = 2927512 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bwa''' or '''Bwaba''' (plural),&lt;ref name="CDR50"&gt;Roy &amp; Wheelock, p.50&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Bobo-Wule''' (Bobo-Oule), are an [[ethnic group]] indigenous to central [[Burkina Faso]] and [[Mali]]. Their population is approximately 300,000. They are known for their use of masks, made from leaves or wood, used in performative ceremonies.

==History==
In the 18th century, Bwa lands were occupied by the [[Bambara people|Bamana]] empire who made the Bwa pay taxes.&lt;ref name="ALA"&gt;{{cite web

 |archivedate=2008-07-22 
 |df= 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The places left unconquered were raided by the Bamana, which led to a weakening of the Bwa social and political systems.&lt;ref name="FAA"&gt;{{cite web

  | url = http://www.forafricanart.com/Bwa_ep_42-1.html
  | accessdate =2008-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, the Bamana declined and the area was dominated by the [[Fula people|Fulani]] who raided and enslaved the Bwa and stole their [[livestock]].&lt;ref name="CDR50" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FAA" /&gt; The end of the 19th century brought French mercenaries who used the Fulani to help control the area.&lt;ref name="ALA" /&gt; The Bwa traditions of storing crops for use in lean years were undermined by the crippling taxation systems of the French and they suffered further from [[famine]] from 1911–1913.&lt;ref name="FAA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ALA2"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French demanded military recruits from the Bwa and in 1915, the Bwa revolted.,&lt;ref name="ALA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FAA" /&gt; starting the [[Volta-Bani War]]. This war lasted about a year&lt;ref name="La guerre coloniale"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Royer|first=Patrick|title=La guerre coloniale du Bani-Volta, 1915-1916|journal=Autrepart|year=2003|volume=26|pages=35–51|url=http://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl-doc/pleins_textes/divers11-01/010032266.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ended with the destruction of many Bwa villages.&lt;ref name="ALA2" /&gt;

==Distribution==
The Bwa live in central Burkina Faso and south-east Mali, between Mali's [[Bani River]] and the Mouhoun River ([[Black Volta]]) in Burkina Faso.&lt;ref name="CDR50" /&gt; Their total population is approximately 300, 000.&lt;ref name="ALA" /&gt; The major towns occupied by the Bwa are [[Houndé]], [[Boni, Mali|Boni]], [[Bagassi]], [[Dossi]] and [[Pa, Burkina Faso|Pa]].&lt;ref name="CDR50" /&gt;

==Society and politics==
Like many of their neighbours, the Bwa are predominantly farmers, their main [[cash crop]] being [[cotton]]. They also farm [[millet]], [[rice]], [[sorghum]], [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]]s, and [[peanut]]s.&lt;ref name="ALA" /&gt; Bwa villages are autonomous and they do not recognise any outside political authority. They are led by a council of male [[Elder (administrative title)|elders]] who make all the major decisions.&lt;ref name="ALA" /&gt; Villages are structured with a cluster of mud walled buildings around a central space where livestock are guarded at night.&lt;ref name="FAA" /&gt;

==Culture==

===Language===
The Bwa speak [[Bwa languages]], a closely related group of [[Gur languages]] of the [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger–Congo family]].&lt;ref name="RGG"&gt;{{cite web
  | last = Gordon
  | first = Raymond G., Jr.

  | accessdate =2008-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some speak Jula ([[Dioula language|Dioula]]) for trading and communication with outsiders, and [[French language|French]] is also used.&lt;ref name="RGG" /&gt;

===Religion and mythology===
Most Bwa still retain traditional [[animism|animist]] beliefs. Approximately 5% are [[Islam|Muslim]], approximately 10% are [[Christianity|Christian]] and approximately 85% are animists.&lt;ref name="ALA2" /&gt;

====Creation myth====
The [[creator god]] of the Bwa is known as Wuro, Difini or Dobweni.&lt;ref name="ALA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CDR50" /&gt; He created the world by setting his creations up in balanced opposing pairs (for example male and female, domesticated and wild).&lt;ref name="ALA2" /&gt; 
====Worship====
The Bwa have to work to maintain the balance.&lt;ref name="ALA2" /&gt; Wuro left the earth after being wounded by a woman pounding millet.&lt;ref name="ALA" /&gt; He had three sons: Dwo (or Do), god of new life and rebirth; Soxo, god of the wilderness and Kwere, the god of lightning.&lt;ref name="ALA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CDR50" /&gt; Wuro sent Dwo, with his brothers, to earth as his messenger and manifestation.&lt;ref name="ALA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ALA2" /&gt;

The Bwa, (the northern Bwa in particular) worship Dwo as an intermediary between man and nature.&lt;ref name="FAA" /&gt; The religious leader of each village is an earth priest called the ''labie'', the oldest man of the village.&lt;ref name="ALA2" /&gt; The congregation of Dwo is a strong cohesive force in Bwa villages.&lt;ref name="ALA" /&gt; The Bwa share their Dwo religion with the neighbouring [[Bobo people]], and probably acquired it from the Bobo centuries ago.&lt;ref name="ALA2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CDR53"&gt;Roy &amp; Wheelock, p.53&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 19th century, following decades of oppression and misfortune, many southern Bwa villages abandoned the cult of Dwo and adopted the religion of their [[Nuna people|Nuna]] neighbours.&lt;ref name="CDR50" /&gt;

The Bwa are well known for their use of traditional [[African tribal masks|tribal masks]].&lt;ref name="CDR50" /&gt; The masks, made from wood and leaves, are used in traditional rituals. In particular the Southern Bwa are known for their tall plank masks, known as ''nwantantay'', and tend to use wood to make their masks.&lt;ref name="CDR50" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FAA" /&gt; [http://www.uiowa.edu/%7Eafricart/Dossi%20mask%20gallery/index.htm] This is a result of their adoption of Nuna religion and their traditions of using wooden masks.&lt;ref name="CDR50" /&gt; About 1897, after a series of disasters, including the arrival of the French and their Senegalese mercenaries, the Bwa decided God had abandoned them, so they turned to their Nuna neighbors and purchased the rights to use, wear, and carve wooden masks, their costumes, and the songs and dances that go with them.  The religion associated with wooden masks is focused on the spirit Lanle, whose power is manifested through the wooden masks.  The northern Bwa use leaf masks more than wooden ones.&lt;ref name="FAA" /&gt; [http://www.uiowa.edu/%7Eafricart/Leaf%20masks%20web/index.htm] These leaf masks frequently represent Dwo in religious ceremonies.&lt;ref name="CDR53" /&gt; The masks also represent the bush spirits including [[snake|serpents]], [[monkey]]s, [[Water Buffalo|buffalo]] and [[hawk]]s.&lt;ref name="FAA" /&gt; Mask performances generally take place in the dry season between February and May.&lt;ref name="CDR50" /&gt;

==Classification==
Early [[Europe]]an explorers to the area called the Bwa "Bobo", confusing them with their neighbours the [[Bobo people]].&lt;ref name="CDR50" /&gt; Although the two groups share religion and culture, they are ethnically distinct.&lt;ref name="ALA2" /&gt; The confusion led to alternative names for the Bwa including Bobo Oule, or Eastern Bobo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | url = http://www.ethnologue.com/country/BF
  | accessdate =2015-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Jula, Bobo Oule means "Red Bobo". This distinguishes the Bwa from the Bobo who are called the "Black Bobo".&lt;ref name="ALA2" /&gt; 

The White Bobo, ''Bobo Gbe'', are also Bwa.&lt;ref&gt;{{e18|bmq|Bomu language}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The southern Bwa became known by their neighbours as ''Nieniegue'' meaning "scarred Bwa" as a result of the tradition of [[scarification]] of their faces and bodies.&lt;ref name="CDR50" /&gt; This practice is no longer commonplace and so the term is also in decline.&lt;ref name="CDR50" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2933">'''Carbon Trade Watch''' is an independent research collective working on [[climate change]] and climate policy from a justice-based perspective. It was formerly part of the Amsterdam-based [[Transnational Institute]]. Since January 2010, Carbon Trade Watch is an autonomous legal association based in Barcelona, Spain. The ‘new’ organisation, [[Environmental Justice Research Collective]] - EJRC, houses the same team and the ongoing work of Carbon Trade Watch as well as expand into new research areas.

By centring its work on bottom-up community-led projects and campaigns, Carbon Trade Watch aims to provide a durable body of research which ensures that a holistic and justice-based analysis of climate change and environmental policies is not forgotten or compromised. As part of their solidarity work, CTW aims to accompany and support movements and communities in their local initiatives and struggles for environmental and social justice. Importantly, the collective gathers and translates work with others in this field to help facilitate broader co-operation and understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Carbon Trade Watch: about us|url=http://www.carbontradewatch.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=12&amp;Itemid=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their work includes the film [[The Carbon Connection]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Carbon Connection|url=http://www.carbontradewatch.org/carbon-connection/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the book [[Carbon Trading: How it works and why it fails]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Carbon Trading: How it works and why it fails|url=http://www.carbontradewatch.org/publications/carbon-trading-how-it-works-and-why-it-fails.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cases==
Carbon Trade Watch has worked on a number of significant cases that helped render public issues of [[emissions trading]]. These cases have also led to a number of academic studies, engaging with these cases in more detail.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Marketing and Making Carbon

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1192">The '''Community Front in Defense of Land''' (in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Frente del Pueblo en Defensa de La Tierra'', FPDT) was formed in 2002, by residents of [[San Salvador Atenco]], to resist their forced displacement by the [[government]] of [[Mexico]].  The government planned to displace them to make way for a [[new Mexico City international airport]].  The people of San Salvador Atenco have risen up against the government from time to time for various reasons, the most common being disputes for land.

'''Comorian''' (''Shikomori'' or ''Shimasiwa'', the "language of islands") is an official language in the [[Comoros]] (an independent country of islands in the [[Indian Ocean]], off [[Mozambique]] and [[Madagascar]]) and widely spoken on the disputed territory of [[Mayotte]], a [[regions of France|region]] of [[France]] claimed by [[Comoros]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Comoros]]&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of the [[Sabaki languages]]. Each island has a different dialect and the four are conventionally divided into two groups: the eastern group is composed of ''Shindzuani'' (spoken on [[Anjouan]]) and ''[[Shimaore dialect|Shimaore]]'' (Mayotte), while the western group is composed of ''Shimwali'' ([[Mohéli]]) and ''Shingazija'' ([[Grande Comore]]). Although the two groups share about 80% of their lexicon, they are not usually [[mutually intelligible]], thus suggesting that they should be considered two language groups rather than four dialects.&lt;ref&gt;Breslar, 1981; Ahmed-Chamanga, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the language was written in the [[Arabic script]]. The [[French Comoros|French colonial administration]] introduced the [[Latin script]], of which a modified version was officially decreed in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed-Chamanga, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The Arabic script remains widely used.

It is the language of ''[[Udzima wa ya Masiwa]],'' the national anthem.

'''Cuitláhuac''' ({{IPA-es|kwiˈtɬawak|-|Cuitlahuac1.ogg}}, {{audio|Kuitlawatsin.ogg|modern Nahuatl pronunciation}}) (c. 1476 &amp;ndash; 1520)&lt;ref&gt;For year of birth, see entry for [http://sites.estvideo.net/malinal/1.hist/CU.html#CUITLAHUAC "CUITLAHUAC"], ''Dictionnaire de la langue nahuatl classique'' (Wimmer 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;  or '''Cuitláhuac''' (in Spanish orthography; {{lang-nah|Cuitlāhuac}},&lt;ref&gt;Wimmer (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-nah|kʷiˈt͡ɬaːwak}}, honorific form: '''Cuitlahuatzin''') was the 10th ''[[tlatoani]]'' (ruler) of the [[Aztec]] city of [[Tenochtitlan]] for 80 days during the year [[Aztec calendar|Two Flint]] (1520).&lt;ref name="cha"&gt;Chimalpahin (1997): pp. 56–57, 164–165, 216–217.&lt;/ref&gt; He is credited with leading the [[Mexica]] resistance to the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire|Spanish invasion]], following the death of his kinsman [[Moctezuma II]].

==Biography==
Cuitláhuac was the eleventh son of the ruler [[Axayacatl]] and a younger brother of [[Moctezuma II]], the late ruler of [[Tenochtitlan]], who died during the Spanish occupation of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Chimalpahin (1997): pp. 148–151.&lt;/ref&gt; His mother's father, also called [[Cuitlahuatzin I|Cuitlahuac]], had been ruler of [[Iztapalapa]],&lt;ref&gt;Chimalpahin (1997): pp. 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt; and the younger Cuitláhuac also ruled there initially.&lt;ref&gt;Chimalpahin (1997): pp. 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cuitláhuac was an experienced warrior and an adviser to Moctezuma, warning him not to allow the Spaniards to enter Tenochtitlan. [[Hernán Cortés]] imprisoned both Moctezuma and Cuitláhuac. Following the massacre of Aztec elites when Cortés was away from Tenochtitlan, the [[Mexica]] besieged the Spanish and their indigenous allies. Cuitláhuac was released on the pretense to reopen the market to get food to the invaders. Moctezuma was killed under disputed circumstances, and Cuitláhuac was elected ''tlatoani'' following the flight of the Spaniards and their allies form Tenochtitlan on June 30, 1520.  Some sources claim he was serving in that role even before Moctezuma's death.&lt;ref&gt;Burkhart, Louise. "Cuitlahuac" in ''Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture'' vol. 2, pp. 339-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuitláhuac was ritually married to Moctezuma's eldest daughter, a ten- or eleven-year-old girl, who later was called [[Isabel Moctezuma]].&lt;ref&gt;Chipman, Donald E. (2005). Moctezuma's Children: Aztec Royalty Under Spanish Rule, 1520–1700. Austin: University of Texas Press, pp. 40-41 {{ISBN|0-292-70628-6}}. {{OCLC|5713428}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cuauhtláhuac.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Cuitláhuac]]
Cuitláhuac ruled just 80 days, perhaps dying from [[smallpox]]&lt;ref name="cha"/&gt; that had been introduced to the [[New World]] by the [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]]. The early sources do not explicitly say from what he succumbed.&lt;ref&gt;Burkhart, "Cuitlahuac", p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after Cuitláhuac's death, [[Cuauhtémoc]] was made the next ''tlatoani''.&lt;ref name="cha"/&gt;

==Legacy==
The modern [[municipio (Mexico)|Mexican municipality]] of [[Cuitláhuac, Veracruz]] and the [[Mexico City Metro]] station [[Metro Cuitláhuac]] are named in honor of Cuitláhuac. The [[asteroid]] 2275 Cuitláhuac is also named after this ruler.

There is an Avenue in Mexico City Called Cuitláhuac (Eje 3 Norte) that runs from Avenue Insurgentes to Avenue Mexico-Tacuba and that is part of an inner ring; also many streets in other towns and villages in Mexico are so called.

==East Africa==
===Time===
For multi-lingual speakers in East Africa, the convention is to use the time system applicable to the language one happens to be speaking at the time.  A person speaking of an early morning event in English would report that it happened at eight o'clock. However, in repeating the same facts in [[Swahili language|Swahili]], one would state that the events occurred at ''saa mbili'' ('two hours').&lt;ref&gt;Erickson, Helen L. and Marianne Gustafsson, [http://research.yale.edu/cgi-bin/swahili/main.cgi?right_frame_src=http%3A//research.yale.edu/swahili/serve_pages/grammar/time.php "TIME - KISWAHILI GRAMMAR NOTES - Time: Saa Ngapi?"], ''[http://www.yale.edu/swahili/home.html The Kamusi Project - The Internet Living Swahili Dictionary]'', Yale Program in African Languages&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--"There is a difference of 6 hours between the Swahili and European methods of counting time."--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ali, Hassan O., [http://www.glcom.com/hassan/lessons/useful_swahili_words.html "Useful Swahili Words: Time"], ''Swahili Language &amp; Culture''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--"It is interesting to note that in the Swahili culture the day starts at sunrise (unlike in the Arab world where the day starts at sunset, and in the Western world where the day starts at midnight)."--&gt;

The [[Luganda|Ganda]] form, ''ssawa bbiri'', is equivalent to the Swahili in that it means literally 'two hours'.&lt;ref&gt;Chesswas, J. D. (1963) Essentials of Luganda. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3556">The '''Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office''' (DPMO), as part of the [[United States Department of Defense]], was an organization that reported to the [[United States Undersecretary of Defense for Policy|Undersecretary of Defense for Policy]] through the [[United States Assistant Secretary of Defense|Assistant Secretary of Defense (International Security Affairs)]].  DPMO provided centralized management of [[prisoner of war]]/[[Missing In Action|missing personnel]] (POW/MP) affairs within the Department of Defense.  

On January 30, 2015, DPMO, along with the [[Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command]], were merged into the new [[Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency]].  DPMO thus ceased to be as a separate entity.

During its existence, activities of the Director of the DPMO included the following:
*Organize, direct, and manage the DPMO and all assigned resources.
*Serve as the DoD focal point for POW/MP matters. 
*Provide DoD participation in the conduct of negotiations with officials of foreign governments in efforts to achieve the fullest possible accounting of Americans missing as a result of military operations.
*Develop uniform DoD procedures for determination of the status of missing personnel and for the systematic, comprehensive, and timely collection, analysis, review, dissemination, and periodic update of information relating to missing personnel.
*Collect and analyze information concerning U.S. military and civilian personnel that are missing, imprisoned, or unaccounted for.
*Maintain case files, comprehensive records, and databases on U.S. military and civilian personnel who are or were prisoners of war, missing, or unaccounted-for as a result of hostile action in compliance with regulatory guidance mandated in the 1996 [[Missing Persons Act]].
*Sanitize or declassify DoD POW/MP documents and related materials for disclosure and release in accordance with 50 U.S. Code, Section 435 Note and Executive Order 12958.
*Maintain open channels of communication with the U.S. Congress, POW/MP families, and veterans' organizations through consultations and other appropriate methods.
*Represent the Department of Defense in established POW/MP related interagency groups.
*Provide intelligence collection requirements to the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]].
*Serve as "executive secretariat" for support to the US-Russia Commission on POW/MP Affairs exercising managerial, administrative, and logistical assistance, as required.

The demographic characteristics of [[Cuba]] are known through census which have been conducted and analyzed by different bureaus since 1774. The [[National Office of Statistics of Cuba]] (ONE) since [[1953 Cuba census|1953]]. The most recent census was conducted in September 2012. The population of Cuba at the 2012 census was 11.1 million. The [[population density]] is 100.7 inhabitants per square kilometer, and the overall [[life expectancy]] in Cuba is 78.0 years. The population has always increased from one census to the next, with the exception of the 2011 census, when the count decreased by 10,000. Since 1950, Cuba's [[birth rate]] has surpassed its [[death rate]]; the natural growth rate of the country is positive. Cuba is in the fourth stage of [[demographic transition]]. In terms of age structure, the population is dominated (71.1%) by the 15- to 64-year-old segment. The median age of the population is 39.5, and the gender ratio of the total population is 0.99 males per female.

According to the 2002 census, Cuba's population was 11,177,743, whereas the 2012 census numbered the population at 11,167,325.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.one.cu/resumenadelantadocenso2012.htm|title=Oficina Nacional de Estadísticas. Cuba|website=One.cu|accessdate=2 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drop between the 2002 and 2012 censuses was the first drop in Cuba's population since Cuba's war of independence. This drop was due to low fertility and emigration, as during this time (fiscal years 2003-2012), 332,028 Cubans received legal permanent residence in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/immigration-statistics/yearbook/2012/LPR/table3d.xls|format=XLS|title=PERSONS OBTAINING LEGAL PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS BY REGION AND COUNTRY OF BIRTH: FISCAL YEARS 2003 TO 2012|website=Dhs.gov|accessdate=2 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the last few years before the end of the [[wet feet, dry feet policy]] in January 12, 2017, the number of Cubans moving to the United States significantly outnumbered the natural increase during those years.

The ancestry of Cubans comes from many sources:

*{{Flagicon|Spain}} [[Spanish people|Spanish]]

During the 18th, 19th and early part of the 20th century, large waves of Spanish immigrants from [[Canary Islands]], [[Catalonia]], [[Andalusia]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], and [[Asturias]] emigrated to Cuba. Between 1820 and 1898, a total of 508,455 people left Spain, and more than 750,000 Spanish immigrants left for Cuba between 1899 and 1930, with many returning to Spain.&lt;ref name="La inmigración entre 1902 y 1920"&gt;[http://www.tau.ac.il/eial/IV_2/bejarano.htm La inmigración entre 1902 y 1930] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606000000/http://www.tau.ac.il/eial/IV_2/bejarano.htm |date=June 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. There are 139,851 Spanish citizens living in Cuba on January, 1, 2018.

The Slave trade brought Africans to Cuba during its early history:
Between 1842 and 1873, 221,000 African slaves entered Cuba.&lt;ref name="La inmigración entre 1902 y 1920"/&gt;

==Genetics==

An autosomal study from 2014 has found out the genetic average ancestry in Cuba to be 72% European, 20% African and 8% Native American with different proportions depending on the self-reported ancestry (White, Mulatto or Mestizo, and Black):&lt;ref&gt;Marcheco-Teruel et al. 2014, [http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1004488#pgen-1004488-g001 Cuba: Exploring the History of Admixture and the Genetic Basis of Pigmentation Using Autosomal and Uniparental Markers]&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1995 study done on the population of Pinar del Rio, found that 50% of the [[Human mitochondrial DNA haplogroup|Mt-DNA lineages]]  (female lineages) could be traced back to Europeans, 46% to Africans and 4% to Native Americans. This figure is consistent with both the historical background of the region, and the current demographics of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=310–7 |doi=10.1002/humu.1380050407 |title=African, Native American, and European mitochondrial DNAs in Cubans from Pinar del Rio Province and implications for the recent epidemic neuropathy in Cuba |year=1995 |last1=Torroni |first1=Antonio |last2=Brown |first2=Michael D. |last3=Lott |first3=Marie T. |last4=Newman |first4=Nancy J. |last5=Wallace |first5=Douglas C. |journal=Human Mutation |volume=5 |issue=4 |pmid=7627185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to another study in 2008, the Native American contribution to present-day Cubans accounted for 33% of the maternal lineages, whereas Africa and Eurasia contributed 45% and 22% of the lineages, respectively. Haplogroup A2 is the main Native American haplogroup in Cuba (21.9% of the total sample), accounting for 67% of the Native American mtDNA gene pool. Regarding [[Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup|Y-chromosome haplogroups]] (male lineages), 78.8% of the sequences found in Cubans are of West Eurasian origin, 19.7% of African origin and 1.5% of East Asian origin. Among the West Eurasian fraction, the vast majority of individuals belong to West European haplogroup [[Haplogroup R1b (Y-DNA)|R1b]]. The African lineages found in Cubans have a Western (haplogroups [[Haplogroup E1 (Y-DNA)|E1]], [[Haplogroup E2 (Y-DNA)|E2]], [[Haplogroup E1b1a (Y-DNA)|E1b1a]] ) and Northern ([[Haplogroup E1b1b (Y-DNA)#E1b1b1b .28E-L19.2FV257.29|E1b1b-M81]] ) African origin. The "[[Berber people|Berber]]" haplogroup E1b1b1b (E-M81), is found at a frequency of 6.1%.&lt;ref&gt;Y-chromosome haplogroup frequencies found in Cuba (132 individuals) grouped according to their phylogeographic origin {{cite journal | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2492877/table/T2/ | pmc=2492877 | pmid=18644108 | doi=10.1186/1471-2148-8-213 | volume=8 | title=Genetic origin, admixture, and asymmetry in maternal and paternal human lineages in Cuba | year=2008 | journal=BMC Evol.

According to Fregel et al. (2009), the fact that autochthonous male North African E-M81 and female U6 lineages from the Canaries have been detected in Cuba and Iberoamerica, demonstrates that Canary Islanders with indigenous ancestors actively participated in the American colonization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fregel | first1 = Rosa | last2 = Gomes | first2 = Verónica | last3 = Gusmão | first3 = Leonor | last4 = González | first4 = Ana M | last5 = Cabrera | first5 = Vicente M | last6 = Amorim | first6 = António | last7 = Larruga | first7 = Jose M  | year = 2009 | title = Demographic history of Canary Islands male gene-pool: replacement of native lineages by European | url = http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/181 | journal = BMC Evolutionary Biology | volume = 9 | issue = | page = 181 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2148-9-181 | pmid = 19650893 | pmc=2728732|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language ==
{{See also|Cuban Spanish}}
[[Spanish language|Spanish]] is the official language of Cuba. Of all the regional variations of Spanish, Cuban Spanish is most similar to, and originates largely from, the dialect spoken in the [[Canary Islands]]. This is a consequence of [[Canarian people|Canarian]] migration, which in the 19th and early 20th century was heavy and continuous. There were also migrations of [[Galicians]] and [[Asturians]] as well, but they did not impact Cuban Spanish to the same degree.

Much of the typical [[Cuban Spanish|Cuban]] replacements for standard Spanish vocabulary stems from Canarian [[lexicon]]. For example, ''{{wiktspa|guagua}}'' (bus) differs from standard Spanish ''{{wiktspa|autobús}}'' the former originated in the Canaries and is an [[onomatopoeia]] stemming from the sound of a [[Klaxon]] horn (wah-wah!). An example of Canarian usage for a Spanish word is the verb {{wiktspa|fajarse}}&lt;ref&gt;''[http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltGUIBusUsual?LEMA=fajar&amp;TIPO_HTML=2&amp;FORMATO=ampliado fajar] at ''Diccionario de la [[Real Academia Española]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; ("to fight"). In standard Spanish the [[verb]] would be ''{{wiktspa|pelearse}}'', while ''fajar'' exists as a non-reflexive verb related to the hemming of a [[skirt]].

The second most spoken language of Cuba is [[Haitian Creole]], used mainly by Haitian immigrants and its descendants going back since the late 18th century, of whom fled the [[Haitian Revolution]].

Other languages of Cuba are [[Cuban Sign Language]],  and [[English language|English]] is commonly studied as a foreign language.

There are also reports of [[Lucumi language|Lucumi]], "[[Habla Congo|Lengua Conga]]" ([[Kongo language|Kongo]]-based [[liturgical language]] of the [[Palo religion]]) and [[Bozal Spanish]] (an "African" socio-dialect of Spanish; now used only in folk religion).&lt;ref&gt;Wirtz, Kristina. 2014. ''Performing Afro-Cuba: Image, Voice, Spectacle in the Making of Race and History''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|978-0-226-11905-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the Ciboney and Classic dialects of [[Taino language|Taino]] and the unattested [[Guanahatabey language|Guanahatabey]] were spoken.

==Religion==
{{Main article|Religion in Cuba}}
Cuba has a multitude of faiths reflecting the island's diverse cultural elements. Catholicism, which was brought to the island by Spanish colonialists at the beginning of the 16th century, is the most prevalent professed faith. After the revolution, Cuba became an officially [[Atheism|atheistic]] state and restricted religious practice. Since the Fourth Cuban Communist Party Congress in 1991, restrictions have been eased and, according to the National Catholic Observer, direct challenges by state institutions to the right to religion have all but disappeared,&lt;ref name="catholic"&gt;[http://ncronline.org/NCR_Online/archives2/2006a/033106/033106o.php Catholic church in Cuba strives to reestablish the faith] National Catholic Observer&lt;/ref&gt; though the church still faces restrictions of written and electronic communication, and can only accept donations from state-approved funding sources.&lt;ref name="catholic"/&gt; The Roman Catholic Church is made up of the Cuban Catholic Bishops' Conference (COCC), led by [[Jaime Lucas Ortega y Alamino]], Cardinal Archbishop of Havana.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} It has eleven dioceses, 56 orders of nuns and 24 orders of priests. In January 1998, [[Pope John Paul II]] paid a historic visit to the island, invited by the Cuban government and Catholic Church.

Afro-Cuban religions, a blend of native African religions and Roman Catholicism, are widely practiced in Cuba. This diversity derives from West and Central Africans who were transported to Cuba, and in effect reinvented their African religions. They did so by combining them with elements of the Catholic belief system, with a result very similar to [[Brazil]]. One of these Afro-Cuban religions is [[Santeria]].

[[Protestantism]], introduced from the United States in the 18th century, has seen a steady increase in popularity. 300,000 Cubans belong to the island's 54 Protestant denominations. [[Pentecostalism]] has grown rapidly in recent years, and the [[Assemblies of God]] alone claims a membership of over 100,000 people. The [[Episcopal Church of Cuba]] claims 10,000 adherents. Cuba has small communities of [[Jews]], [[Muslim]]s, [[Buddhist]]s and members of the [[Bahá'í Faith]].

Illicit migration is a continuing problem. Cubans attempt to depart the island and enter the US using homemade rafts, alien smugglers, [[direct flight]]s, or falsified visas; Cubans also use non-maritime routes to enter the US including direct flights to Miami and overland via the southwest US/Mexican border, and islands adjacent to Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.

[[File:Shish-kebab-skewer-60458 640.jpg|thumb|“The truly creative changes and the big shifts occur right at the edge of chaos,” said Dr. Robert Bilder, a psychiatry and psychology professor at UCLA’s Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schwartz|first1=K.|title=On the Edge of Chaos: Where Creativity Flourishes|url=https://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/2014/05/06/on-the-edge-of-chaos-where-creativity-flourishes/|publisher=KOED|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''edge of chaos''' is used to denote a transition space between [[Orderliness|order]] and [[Randomness|disorder]] that is hypothesized to exist within a wide variety of systems. This transition zone between the two regimes is known as the edge of [[chaos theory|chaos]], a region of bounded instability that engenders a constant dynamic interplay between order and disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Complexity Labs|title="Edge of Chaos"|url=http://complexitylabs.io/edge-of-chaos/.|website=Complexity Labs|accessdate=August 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though the idea of the edge of chaos is abstract and unintuitive, it has many applications in such fields as [[ecology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ranjit Kumar Upadhyay|title=Dynamics of an ecological model living on the edge of chaos|journal=Applied Mathematics and Computation|date=2009|volume= 210| issue = 2|pages=455–464|doi=10.1016/j.amc.2009.01.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[business management]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Deragon|first1=Jay|title=Managing On The Edge Of Chaos|url=http://www.relationship-economy.com/2012/08/managing-on-the-edge-of-chaos/|website=Relationship Economy}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[psychology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lawler|first1=E.|last2=Thye|first2=S.|last3=Yoon|first3=J.|title=Order on the Edge of Chaos Social Psychology and the Problem of Social Order|date=2015|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=9781107433977}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[political science]], and other domains of the [[social science]]. [[Physicists]] have shown that adaptation to the edge of chaos occurs in almost all systems with feedback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wotherspoon|first1=T.|last2=et.|first2=al.|title=Adaptation to the edge of chaos with random-wavelet feedback|journal=J. Phys. Chem. A|date=2009|doi=10.1021/jp804420g|bibcode=2009JPCA..113...19W|volume=113|pages=19–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}
The phrase ''edge of chaos'' was coined by [[mathematician]] [[Doyne Farmer]] to describe the transition phenomenon discovered by [[computer scientist]] [[Christopher Langton]]. The phrase originally refers to an area in the range of a [[Variable (programming)|variable]], λ (lambda), which was varied while examining the behavior of a [[cellular automaton]] (CA). As λ varied, the behavior of the CA went through a [[phase transition]] of behaviors. Langton found a small area conducive to produce CAs capable of [[universal computation]].  At around the same time [[physicist]] [[James P. Crutchfield]] and others used the phrase ''onset of chaos'' to describe more or less the same concept.

In the sciences in general, the phrase has come to refer to a metaphor that some [[physics|physical]], [[biology|biological]], [[economics|economic]] and [[sociology|social]]  [[system]]s operate in a region between order and either complete [[randomness]] or [[chaos theory|chaos]], where the [[complexity]] is maximal. The generality and significance of the idea, however, has since been called into question by [[Melanie Mitchell]] and others.  The phrase has also been borrowed by the business community and is sometimes used inappropriately and in contexts that are far from the original scope of the meaning of the term.

[[Stuart Kauffman]] has studied [[mathematical model]]s of [[evolution|evolving]] systems in which the rate of evolution is maximized near the edge of chaos.

==Adaptation==
[[File:Adaptation_to_the_edge_of_chaos.jpg|thumb|right|"Seeking the edge of chaos, therefore, is not seeking disorder or randomness but the right balance between order and flexibility", Joost Pauwelyn&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pauwelyn|first1=Joost|title=At the Edge of Chaos?Foreign Investment Law as a Complex Adaptive System, How It Emerged and How It Can Be Reformed|journal=ICSIDReview|volume=29|issue=2|pages=372|date=2014|doi=10.1093/icsidreview/siu001}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Adaptation]] plays a vital role for all living organisms and systems. All of them are constantly changing their inner properties to better fit in the current environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Strogatz|first1=Steven|title=Nonlinear dynamics and Chaos|date=1994|publisher=[[Westview Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important instruments for the [[adaptation]] are the [[adaptive systems|self-adjusting parameters]] inherent for many natural systems. The prominent feature of systems with self-adjusting parameters is an ability to avoid [[chaos theory|chaos]].The name for this phenomenon is ''"Adaptation to the edge of chaos"''.

Adaptation to the edge of chaos refers to the idea that many [[complex adaptive systems]] seem to intuitively evolve toward a regime near the boundary between chaos and order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kauffman|first1=S.A.|title=The Origins of Order Self-Organization and Selection in Evolution|date=1993|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=New York|isbn=9780195079517}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physics have shown that edge of chaos is the optimal settings for control of a system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pierre|first1=D.|last2=et.|first2=al.|title=A theory for adaptation and competition applied to logistic map dynamics|journal=Physica D|date=1994|volume=75|pages=343–360|bibcode=1994PhyD...75..343P|doi=10.1016/0167-2789(94)90292-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also an optional setting that can influence the ability of a physical system to perform primitive functions for computation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Langton|first1=C.A.|title=Computation at the edge of chaos|journal=Physica D|date=1990|volume=42|doi=10.1016/0167-2789(90)90064-v|bibcode=1990PhyD...42...12L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the importance of [[adaptation]] in many natural systems, adaptation to the edge of the chaos takes a prominent position in many scientific researches. Physicists demonstrated that adaptation to state at the boundary of chaos and order occurs in population of [[cellular automata]] rules which optimize the performance evolving with a genetic algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Packard|first1=N.H.|title=Adaptation toward the edge of chaos|journal=Dynamic patterns in complex systems|date=1988|pages=293–301}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mitchell|first1=M.|last2=Hraber|first2=P.|last3=Crutchfield|first3=J.|title=Revisiting the edge of chaos: Evolving cellular automata to perform computations|journal=Complex Systems|date=1993|volume=7|issue=2|pages=89–130|arxiv=adap-org/9303003|bibcode=1993adap.org..3003M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of this phenomenon is the [[self-organized criticality]] in [[avalanche]] and earthquake models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bak|first1=P.|last2=Tang|first2=C.|last3=Wiesenfeld|first3=K.|title=Self-organized criticality|journal=Phys Rev A|date=1988|volume=38|pages=364–374|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.38.364|bibcode=1988PhRvA..38..364B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The simplest model for chaotic dynamics is the logistic map. Self-adjusting logistic map dynamics exhibit adaptation to the edge of chaos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Melby|first1=P.|last2=et.|first2=al.|title=Adaptation to the edge of chaos in the self-adjusting logistic map.|journal=Phys.

He helped to investigate the [[Syrian Civil War]], [[2014–15 Russian military intervention in Ukraine]], the downing of [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17]] and the [[Poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal]]. He first gained mainstream media attention by identifying weapons in uploaded videos from the Syrian conflict.&lt;ref name="Weaver"&gt;{{cite news |last=Weaver |first=Matthew |date=21 March 2013 |title=How Brown Moses exposed Syrian arms trafficking from his front room |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/21/frontroom-blogger-analyses-weapons-syria-frontline |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Radden Keefe"&gt;{{cite news |last=Keefe |first=Patrick Radden |date=25 November 2013 |title=Rocket Man |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/11/25/rocket-man-2 |newspaper=[[The New Yorker]] |accessdate=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the founder of [[Bellingcat]], a website for citizen journalists to investigate current events using open-source information such as videos, maps and pictures.

==Life and work==
Higgins was born in [[Shrewsbury]] in January 1979.&lt;ref name="Weaver" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=I8I9vmlYyuiWSrzCRT26Hw&amp;scan=1|title=Index entry|accessdate=2 February 2018|work=FreeBMD|publisher=ONS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/officers/CXZW53jimPQ9-c8pqoXHtbFOOEE/appointments |title=Eliot Ward HIGGINS |website=Personal Appointments |publisher=[[Companies House]] |access-date=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Haberdashers' Adams|Adams' Grammar School]] in [[Shropshire]] from 1990-95.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.adamsgs.uk/our-community/alumni |title=Adams' Grammar School Alumni |publisher=Adams' Grammar School |author= |date= |accessdate=November 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His previous work history includes work in finance and admin.&lt;ref name="Bosker"/&gt; In 2012, when Higgins began blogging the Syrian civil war, he was unemployed and spent his days taking care of his child at home;&lt;ref name="Weaver" /&gt; he is married to a Turkish woman.&lt;ref name="Bosker"&gt;{{cite news |last=Bosker |first=Bianca |date=18 November 2013 |title=Inside The One-Man Intelligence Unit That Exposed The Secrets And Atrocities Of Syria's War |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/18/eliot-higgins-syria_n_4269417.html |newspaper=[[The Huffington Post]] |accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shubert"&gt;{{cite news |last=Shubert |first=Atika |author-link=Atika Shubert |date=1 April 2013 |title=In his living room, blogger traces arms trafficking to Syria |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/03/29/world/europe/syria-weapons-blogger |publisher=[[CNN International]] |accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Higgins took the pseudonym Brown Moses from the [[Frank Zappa]] song "Brown Moses" on the album ''[[Thing-Fish]]''.&lt;ref name="Weaver" /&gt;

Higgins' analyses of Syrian weapons, which began as a hobby out of his home in his spare time, are frequently cited by the press and human rights groups and have led to parliamentary discussion.&lt;ref name="Weaver" /&gt; His Brown Moses Blog began in March 2012 by covering the Syrian conflict. Higgins operates by monitoring over 450 YouTube channels daily looking for images of weapons and tracking when new types appear in the war, where, and with whom.&lt;ref name="Weaver" /&gt; According to ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' reporter Matthew Weaver, Higgins has been "hailed as something of a pioneer" for his work. Higgins has no background or training in weapons and is entirely self-taught, saying that "Before the Arab spring I knew no more about weapons than the average Xbox owner. I had no knowledge beyond what I'd learned from Arnold Schwarzenegger and Rambo."&lt;ref name="Weaver" /&gt; Higgins does not speak or read Arabic.&lt;ref name="Shubert"/&gt;

Higgins is credited with being among the first to report on the widespread use of improvised [[barrel bomb]]s by the Syrian government, a phenomenon which has spread to other troubled nations such as Iraq to combat insurgencies and opposition forces.&lt;ref name=higgins&gt;{{cite web |url=http://brown-moses.blogspot.com/2012/08/the-mystery-of-syrian-barrel-bombs.html |title=The Mystery of the Syrian Barrel Bombs |work=[[Brown Moses Blog]] |first=Eliot |last=Higgins |date=30 August 2012 |accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Marcus |first=Jonathan |date=20 December 2013 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-25466541 |title=Syria conflict: Barrel bombs show brutality of war |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other aspects of the Syrian conflict uncovered and documented by Higgins include the use of [[cluster bomb]]s in 2012, which the Syrian government previously denied using; the proliferation of shoulder-launched heat-seeking missiles known as [[MANPADS]]; and the proliferation of [[Croatia]]n-made weapons which was reportedly connected to the United States, a story later picked up by ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name="Weaver" /&gt; He has also investigated the Syrian regime's alleged use of chemical weapons, including the [[Ghouta chemical attack]] in detail.&lt;ref name="Burrell"&gt;{{cite news |last=Burrell |first=Ian |date=18 January 2015 |title=With Isis, Assad and Putin exposed, who's next on citizen journalist Eliot Higgins' list? |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/with-isis-assad-and-putin-exposed-whos-next-on-citizen-journalist-eliot-higgins-list-9983831.html |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/10730163/The-blogger-who-tracks-Syrian-rockets-from-his-sofa.html |title= The blogger who tracks Syrian rockets from his sofa| first=Patrick Radden |last= Keefe |date= 29 March 2014 |accessdate= 11 April 2015 |work= [[The Daily Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Higgins has also performed consulting work for groups such as [[Human Rights Watch]].&lt;ref name="Bosker" / [[Theodore Postol]], a professor at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], and Richard Lloyd, a former UN weapons inspector, criticised some aspects of Higgins's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/mh-abschuss-ueber-ukraine-blogger-strafen-moskau-luegen-1.2502698-2|title=Ein-Mann-Nachrichtenagentur|trans-title=One man news agency|language=German|date=1 June 2015|work= [[Suddeutsche Zeitung]]|archiveurl=https://archive.is/S69ob|archivedate=23 September 2015|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Higgins used [[geolocation]] to publish an estimate of where the [[James Foley (journalist)|James Foley]] execution video was made outside [[Raqqa]], an [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]] stronghold in north-central Syria. Higgins used visual markers in stills from the video and his interpretation of satellite images of the terrain around Raqqa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/11053544/Is-this-where-James-Foley-was-beheaded.html|title=Is this where James Foley was beheaded?|publisher=The Telegraph|author=Josie Ensor|date=August 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 Higgins was a visiting research associate at the ''Centre for Science and Security Studies'' (CSSS) at the Department of War Studies at [[King’s College London]] and visiting research fellow at [[University of California Berkeley]]'s Human Rights Center.&lt;ref name="arselec" /&gt; In October of that year, Higgins was the subject of [[BBC Radio Four]]'s programme ''Profile''.&lt;ref name="BBC Profile"&gt;{{cite episode| title= Profile: Eliot Higgins| series= Profile| credits= Presenter: Mark Coles; Producer: Smita Patel; Researcher: Oliver Jones; Editor: Emma Rippon| network= BBC| station= [[BBC Radio Four]]| url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m0000qf4 | airdate= 14 October 2018| accessdate= 17 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bellingcat==
{{main|Bellingcat}}
On 15 July 2014, Higgins began a new website called [[Bellingcat]] for [[citizen journalism|citizen journalists]] to investigate current events using open-source information such as videos, maps and pictures.

Among its major projects, Bellingcat has investigated the downing of [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17]] in Ukraine. Its work is being considered by the [[Korps landelijke politiediensten|Dutch police]] investigating the crash,&lt;ref name="Burrell" /&gt; and Higgins has been interviewed twice by the investigators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/entry/eliot-higgins-putin-syria_us_561fc877e4b028dd7ea6e15c?section=australia|title=The Citizen Journalists Challenging Assad And Putin's Story Of War|date=16 October 2015|last=Alfred|first=Charlotte|publisher=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bellingcat has suggested that the anti-aircraft missile that hit the plane was fired by a Russian unit, the 53rd Buk brigade, based in the city of [[Kursk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work= The Guardian |date=8 September 2014 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/08/malaysia-airlines-mh-17-dutch-safety-board-preliminary-report |first=Julian |last=Borger |accessdate=5 July 2015 |title=MH17: Dutch Safety Board to publish preliminary report on disaster}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 May 2015, Bellingcat released a report alleging among other things photo manipulation of satellite images released by the [[Russian Ministry of Defense]].&lt;ref name=mayMH17report&gt;{{cite web |title=Forensic Analysis of Satellite Images Released by the Russian Ministry of Defense: A bell¿ngcat Investigation |url=https://www.bellingcat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Forensic_analysis_of_satellite_images_EN.pdf |date=30 May 2015 |publisher=Bellingcat |accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The photos concerned the location of Ukrainian [[Buk missile system|Buk missile launchers]] around the time MH17 was shot down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=MH17 – Forensic Analysis of Satellite Images Released by the Russian Ministry of Defence |url=https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2015/05/31/mh17-forensic-analysis-of-satellite-images-released-by-the-russian-ministry-of-defence/ |date=31 May 2015 |accessdate=22 June 2015 |publisher=Bellingcat}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bellingcat's use of [[error level analysis]] in its report was criticized by Jens Kriese, a professional image analyst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= 'Bellingcat Report Doesn't Prove Anything': Expert Criticizes Allegations of Russian MH17 Manipulation |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/expert-criticizes-allegations-of-russian-mh17-manipulation-a-1037125.html |date=June 4, 2015 |accessdate=June 22, 2015 |first=Benjamin |last=Bidder |work= [[Spiegel Online International]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Bellingcat's findings about which field the missile was fired from were vindicated in September 2016 by the Dutch-led MH17 [[MH17#Criminal_investigation|Joint Investigation Team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Harding |first1=Luke |author-link1=Luke Harding |last2=Luhn |first2=Alec |date=28 September 2016 |title=MH17: Buk missile finding sets Russia and west at loggerheads |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/28/flight-mh17-shot-down-by-missile-brought-in-from-russia-ukraine-malaysia-airlines |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Atlantic Council==
Higgins is a senior fellow in the [[Digital Forensic Research Lab]] (since 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/about/experts/list/eliot-higgins|title=Eliot Higgins - Nonresident Senior Fellow, Digital Forensic Research Lab, Future Europe Initiative|website=Atlantic Council|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160222070801/http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/about/experts/list/eliot-higgins|archivedate=22 February 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and ''Future Europe Initiative'', projects run by the [[Atlantic Council]], a leading US [[geopolitic]]al strategy think-tank based in Washington, D.C. 

In 2015, Higgins partnered with the [[Atlantic Council]] to co-author the report [http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/publications/reports/hiding-in-plain-sight-putin-s-war-in-ukraine-and-boris-nemtsov-s-putin-war Hiding in Plain Sight: Putin's War in Ukraine] which examined direct Russian military involvement in Ukraine. The report was the inspiration for the documentary [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zssIFN2mso Selfie Soldiers] in which [[Vice News]] correspondent [[Simon Ostrovsky]] followed digital traces left by a Russian soldier named Bato Dambaev who was sent to fight in Eastern Ukraine. In June 2015 on the invitation of former Belgium Prime Minister [[Guy Verhofstadt]], Higgins together with his report co-author [[Atlantic Council]]'s Maks Czuperski presented Hiding in Plain Sight at the [[European Parliament]] alongside Russian opposition figure [[Ilya Yashin]] and former Russian Prime Minister [[Mikhail Kasyanov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boris Nemtsov's "Putin.War" &amp; Atlantic Council's "Hiding in Plain Sight: Putin's War in Ukraine"|url=https://alde.livecasts.eu/eu-launch-boris-nemtsov-atlantic-council|website=Putin. War|publisher=ALDE Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Higgins was one of five authors of an Atlantic Council report released in 2016, “Distract, Deceive, Destroy,” on Russia’s role in Syria.&lt;ref name=dddreport&gt;{{cite web |title=DISTRACT, DECEIVE, DESTROY: Putin at War in Syria |url=http://publications.atlanticcouncil.org/distract-deceive-destroy/assets/download/ddd-report.pdf |date=April 2016 |publisher=Atlantic Council |accessdate=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Higgins has received significant praise and support from human rights groups, journalists, and non-profit organisations. "Brown Moses is among the best out there when it comes to weapons monitoring in Syria," said Peter Bouckaert, emergencies director at [[Human Rights Watch]].&lt;ref name="Weaver" /&gt; ''The New York Times'' war reporter [[C.J. Chivers]] said that fellow journalists owe a debt to Higgins' investigative reporting in Syria. "Many people, whether they admit or not, have been relying on that blog's daily labour to cull the uncountable videos that circulate from the conflict," he said.&lt;ref name="Weaver" /&gt; [[Amnesty International]] said that the Brown Moses Blog was vital in proving the Syrian government was using ballistic missiles, information then used to send a research mission to Syria.&lt;ref name="O'Brien" /&gt;

Eliot Higgins has been a subject of interest for the British and U.S. media and is described described as "one of the world's foremost citizen journalists" by [[News Limited]] reporter Victoria Craw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/technology/online/security/bellingcat-citizen-journalist-eliot-higgins-is-holding-global-governments-to-account/news-story/196436ab0cba6b6eea0a76c5f16af0a1|title=Bellingcat citizen journalist Eliot Higgins is holding global governments to account|author=Victoria Craw|publisher=news.com.au|date=29 January 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117140039/https://www.news.com.au/technology/online/security/bellingcat-citizen-journalist-eliot-higgins-is-holding-global-governments-to-account/news-story/196436ab0cba6b6eea0a76c5f16af0a1|archivedate=2015-11-17|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been profiled in print by ''[[The Guardian]]'',&lt;ref name="Weaver" /&gt; ''[[The Independent]]'',&lt;ref name="Burrell" /&gt; ''[[The Huffington Post]]'',&lt;ref name="Bosker" /&gt; and ''[[The New Yorker]]''.&lt;ref name="Radden Keefe" /&gt; Television features have been run by [[Channel 4 News]]&lt;ref name="O'Brien"&gt;{{cite news |last=O'Brien |first=Paraic |date=30 March 2013 |title=Brown Moses: the British blogger tracking Syrian arms |url=http://www.channel4.com/news/brown-moses-blog-syria-arms-weapons-croatia |publisher=[[Channel 4 News]] |accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[CNN International]].&lt;ref name="Shubert" /&gt; He has also been covered by non-English sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://brown-moses.blogspot.com/2013/04/the-brown-moses-blog-fundraiser-launches.html |title=The Brown Moses Blog Fundraiser Launches! |work=Brown Moses Blog |first=Eliot |last=Higgins |date=16 April 2013 |accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Finisterre languages''' are a [[language family|family]] within the original [[Trans–New Guinea languages|Trans&amp;ndash;New Guinea]] (TNG) proposal, and [[William A. Foley]] considers their TNG identity to be established. They share with the [[Huon languages]] verbs that are [[suppletion|suppletive]] depending on the person and number of the object, strong morphological evidence that they are related.

==Internal structure==
Huon and Finisterre, and then the connection between them, were identified by [[Kenneth McElhanon]] (1967, 1970). They are clearly valid language families. Finisterre contains six clear branches. Beyond that, classification is based on lexicostatistics, which is generally unreliable.  The outline below follows McElhanon and Carter et al. (2012).

* '''Finisterre''' family
** Erap branch
***Boana: [[Nuk language|Nuk]]–[[Nek language|Nek]], [[Nakama language|Nakama]], [[Numanggang language|Numanggang]], [[Munkip language|Munkip]]
***[[Finongan language|Finongan]], [[Gusan language|Gusan]], [[Mamaa language|Mamaa]]
***[[Nimi language|Nimi]], [[Ma Manda language|Sauk]] (Ma Manda), [[Uri language|Uri]]
** Gusap–Mot branch
***[[Madi language (Papuan)|Madi]] (Gira), [[Neko language|Neko]], [[Nekgini language|Nekgini]]
***[[Ngaing language|Ngaing]], [[Rawa language|Rawa]], [[Ufim language|Ufim]], [[Iyo language|Iyo]] (Nahu)
** Uruwa branch: [[Sakam language|Sakam]] (Kutong) – [[Som language|Som]], [[Nukna language|Nukna]] (Komutu), [[Yau language|Yau]], ?[[Weliki language|Weliki]]
** Wantoat branch: [[Awara language|Awara]]–[[Wantoat language|Wantoat]] (Yagawak, Bam), [[Tuma-Irumu language|Tuma-Irumu]]
** Warup branch: [[Asaro'o language|Asaro'o]] (Morafa) – Molet, [[Bulgebi language|Bulgebi]], [[Degenan language|Degenan]], [[Forak language|Forak]], [[Guya language|Guya]] (Guiarak), [[Gwahatike language|Gwahatike]] (Dahating), [[Muratayak language|Muratayak]] (Asat, Yagomi)
** Yupna branch: [[Domung language|Domung]]–[[Ma language (Papuan)|Ma]] (Mebu), [[Nankina language|Nankina]], [[Bonkiman language|Bonkiman]]–[[Yopno language|Yopno]] (Kewieng, Wandabong, Nokopo, Isan), ?[[Yout Wam language|Yout Wam]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4294">'''Firearms in Thailand''' refers to the number and types of firearms in the country in civilian (unofficial) hands and the laws and societal norms that govern their possession and use. 

About one in ten people in Thailand legally own a gun. There are more than six million registered guns in a country with a population of 66.7 million.&lt;ref name="DW-20160219"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Domínguez |first1=Gabriel |title=A look at Thailand's fervent gun culture |url=https://www.dw.com/en/a-look-at-thailands-fervent-gun-culture/a-19060721 |accessdate=31 October 2018 |work=Deutsche Welle |date=2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Small Arms Survey]] estimates that the total number of guns, both licit and illicit, held by Thai civilians in 2017 is 10,300,000,&lt;ref name="SAS-2018"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Karp |first1=Aaron |title=Briefing Paper; Estimating  Global Civilian-Held Firearms Numbers |publisher=Small Arms Survey; Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies |location=Geneva |page=4 |edition=June 2018 |url=http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/T-Briefing-Papers/SAS-BP-Civilian-Firearms-Numbers.pdf |accessdate=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; equating to 15.1 firearms per 100 inhabitants. Comparable figures for the other [[ASEAN]] nations are: Cambodia, 4.5 per 100 inhabitants; Philippines, 3.6; Laos, 3.0; Myanmar, 1.6; Vietnam, 1.6; Brunei, 1.4; Malaysia, 0.7; Singapore, 0.3; and Indonesia, zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Civilian Firearms Holdings 2017 |url=http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/Weapons_and_Markets/Tools/Firearms_holdings/SAS-BP-Civilian-held-firearms-annexe.pdf |website=Small Arms Survey (SAS) |accessdate=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ownership of firearms is particularly high in the south Thailand provinces of [[Pattani]], [[Yala Province|Yala]], and [[Narathiwat]] that have witnessed significant [[South Thailand Insurgency|insurgency and rebellion since 2004]].&lt;ref name="DW-20160219" /&gt;

==Gun laws==
The Thai laws applicable to firearms regulation are the ''Act Controlling Firearms, Ammunition, Explosives, Fireworks and Imitation of Firearms, B.E. 2490'' (1947)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vertic.org/media/National%20Legislation/Thailand/TH_Firearms_Ammunition_Act.pdf  |title=''Firearms, Ammunition, Explosives, Fireworks, and the Equivalent of Firearms Act B.E. 2490'' (1947)|website=Vertic|format=English translation|accessdate=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TLF-2011"&gt;{{cite web |title=Gun Law of Thailand |author=Chaninat &amp; Leeds|url=http://thailawforum.com/database1/thailand-gun-law.html |website=Thailand Law Forum |accessdate=1 November 2018 |date=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Amendments to the Act Controlling Firearms, Ammunition, Explosives, Fireworks and Imitation of Firearms, B.E. 2490'' (2017).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Zeldin |first1=Wendy |title=Thailand: Amendments to Firearms Law |url=https://www.loc.gov/law/foreign-news/article/thailand-amendments-to-firearms-law/ |website=Library of Congress |accessdate=1 November 2018 |date=23 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Violent gun deaths ==
In 2016 Thailand's rate of violent gun-related deaths stood at 4.45 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants. In comparison, that of the Philippines was 7.42; the US, 3.85; Cambodia, 0.96; Myanmar, 0.56; Malaysia, 0.46; Indonesia, 0.10; and Singapore, 0.03.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Aizenman |first1=Nurith |title=Gun Violence: How The U.S. Compares With Other Countries |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2017/10/06/555861898/gun-violence-how-the-u-s-compares-to-other-countries |accessdate=1 November 2018 |work=National Public Radio (NPR) |date=October 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enablers just allow or cover for the narcissist's (abuser's) own bad behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Ziehl N [https://qz.com/852187/coping-with-chaos-in-the-white-house Coping with narcissistic personality disorder in the White House] ''[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]]'' 06 Dec 2016&lt;/ref&gt;    The phrase, originally [[winged monkeys]], is derived from [[L. Frank Baum]]'s classic children's novel ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]''. The [[wicked witch]] sent them to carry out her attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.monkeyswithwings.com |title=The Flying Monkeys of Burlington, Vermont |last1=Carlson |first1=Rik  |work=monkeyswithwings.com |accessdate=January 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identity==
Flying monkeys can be anyone who believes the narcissist's [[false self|fake persona]] including the narcissist's spouse, child, friend, sibling or cousin.&lt;ref name=Bailey&gt;Bailey-Rug C (2016) It's Not You, It's Them: When People Are More Than Selfish&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Atkinson, flying monkeys are usually unwittingly [[Psychological manipulation|manipulated]] people who believe the [[Smear campaign|smears]] about the victim although they may be another narcissist working in tandem.&lt;ref name=Atkinson/&gt;

According to [[Sam Vaknin|Vaknin]], proxy abusers can be:&lt;ref name=Vaknin&gt;Vaknin S (2010) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0aOH6kw9ug Abuse By Proxy: From Smear Campaigns to 3rd-party Stalking and Abuse]&lt;/ref&gt;  
* the abuser's associates
* the victim's associates – manipulated to side with the abuser.
* authority and institutional figures – manipulated to side with the abuser.

==Tactics==
The flying monkey does the narcissist’s bidding to inflict additional torment to the target. It may consist of spying, spreading [[gossip]], threatening, painting the narcissist as the victim ([[victim playing]]) and the target as the perpetrator ([[victim blaming]]). Despite this, the narcissist does not hesitate to make flying monkeys his or her [[scapegoating|scapegoats]] when and if needed.&lt;ref name=Bailey/&gt;&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;Moore, J., [http://facesofnarcissism.com/2015/03/23/472/ Are you being used as a flying monkey for a narcissist?] 23 Mar 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The flying monkeys may make it seem like the narcissist is not really involved. They are likely to have no idea that they are being used.&lt;ref name=Moore/&gt;

Multiple flying monkeys are likely to act as a [[mobbing]] force against a victim.&lt;ref&gt;[http://flyingmonkeysdenied.com Flying Monkeys Denied] [[C-PTSD]] and Narcissistic Abuse Recovery Website&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[divorce]] conflicts, the children can be used by one party as a weapon against the other party.&lt;ref name=Vaknin/&gt;

==Motivation==
The motives behind the narcissist's support group can be multiple. Service providers may be seduced by the [[Narcissistic charm|narcissist's charm]] into taking a one-sided perspective.&lt;ref&gt;S. Nightshade, ''A Pre-Book and a Victim's Guide to Surviving the Narcissist'' (2016)&lt;/ref&gt; Family members may in good faith attempt to sort out the "[[Identified patient|problematic one]]".&lt;ref&gt;M. McGoldrick, ''You Can Go Home Again'' (London 1995) p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; The [[codependent]] may seek to participate in the narcissist's [[omnipotence]], or use them as sanction for their own aggressive instincts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Otto Fenichel]], ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 510 and p. 498-500&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, others may simply be swept up by force of personality to [[Definition of the situation|define the situation]] along the narcissist's own lines.&lt;ref&gt;F. Wittels, ''Sigmund Freud'' (London 1924) p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2667">'''Houara''' ([[Berber languages|Berber]]: ''Ihuwwaren'', {{Lang-ar|هوارة}}), also spelled Hawwara, is a large [[Berbers|Berber]] tribe spread widely in the [[Maghreb]] ([[Tamazgha]]) and has descendants in [[Upper Egypt]].

Houara are amongst the most prominent tribes in Upper Egypt, with branches found mainly in [[Sohag Governorate|Sohag]], [[Qena Governorate|Qena]], and [[Asyut Governorate|Asyut]]. They are considered to be the [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]] of Sohag to this day. Hawwara tribes were deemed to be the real rulers of the region, up until the campaigns of [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] in 1813, which finally crushed their influence.&lt;ref&gt;Baer, Gabriel. "Studies in the Social History of Modern Egypt." (1969).&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]] rule in Egypt, the Hawwara were the most dominant tribe in Upper Egypt under the leadership of Sheikh Hammam.&lt;ref&gt;Petry, Carl F., ed. ''The Cambridge History of Egypt''. Vol. 1. Cambridge University Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Sultan [[Barquq]] made relationships with the Hawwara in order to keep the Arab tribes from becoming powerful.&lt;ref&gt;Petry, Carl F. "A Geniza for Mamluk Studies? Charitable Trust (Waqf) Documents as a Source for Economic and Social History." Mamluk Studies Review 2 (1998): 51-60.&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of the Mamluk dynasty, the Hawwara and Arabs began cooperating to kill Mamluks. Due to their cooperation, the Mamluks labelled the Hawwara as being [[Arabs|Arab]]. Although they are originally Berber, the term "[[Sheikh]] of the Arabs" is usually bestowed upon their leaders. The Hawwara are purely Berber in genetics, they usually only married within their family or from other Hawwara factions across North Africa to form external alliances.&lt;ref&gt;Abul-Magd, Zeinab. ''Imagined empires: A history of revolt in Egypt''. Univ of California Press, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 21st century, Hawwaras began marrying outside their tribe since the family lineage was becoming extinct, this led to the Hawwara becoming increasingly [[Arabized Berber|arabized]].

Many smaller tribes, villages, and regions still bear this name in Berber countries today such as Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, and Libya.

A '''house-warming party''' is a [[party]] traditionally held soon after moving into a new [[House|residence]]. It is an occasion for the hosts to present their new home to their friends, post-moving, and for friends to give gifts to furnish the new home. House-warming parties are generally informal. Usually there are no planned activities besides a possible tour.

==Etiquette==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2017}}
It is considered proper [[etiquette]] to invite guests at least a few days, or up to three weeks, in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emilypost.com/everyday/rude_situations.htm#12 |title=Emily Post Institute—Invitation Etiquette |publisher= [[Emily Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gifts are customarily necessary. They usually consist of something for the new house (such as a potted [[plant]], a [[vase]], or a [[picture frame]]) or something to be enjoyed during the party (such as a bottle of [[whiskey]], a [[flower bouquet|bouquet]] of [[flower]]s, or a [[gift basket]] of [[food]]stuffs). Bluebirds are often given in some countries as they are believed to bless the new house with happiness and good luck. Today it is also customary to provide bluebird-themed paraphernalia such as china. Pineapples and coconuts are also common housewarming gifts and the pineapple and coconuts have served as a symbol of hospitality and warm welcome through the history of the Americas.

In East Lancashire as in parts of Scotland (particularly [[Ayrshire]] and [[Banffshire]]) a [[frog]] is seen as a giver of good luck. A gift of a frog is often made{{Dubious|Do we mean "an object depicting a frog"?|date=November 2017}} as a wedding or housewarming gift for good luck and fertility.

In Germany, common gifts include gift certificates, for example from a furniture shop. Guests also usually bring something to drink or a homemade dish, such as a salad or a pie.

==Origins==
The term "housewarming" is descended literally from the act of warming a new house, in the days before central heating. Each guest would bring firewood, and build fires in all the available fireplaces, offering firewood as a gift. Aside from warming the house, this was  also believed to repel evil spirits by creating a protective atmosphere of warmth. Uninhabited houses were considered targets for vagrant spirits, and therefore used to require a certain level of cleansing before a house was safe to be occupied by young children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TNxiHDi51n8C&amp;pg=RA1-PA730&amp;lpg=RA1-PA730&amp;dq=housewarming+etymological&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OO3wNQYwRz&amp;sig=28Sf35XqLomeayWVPq7gQWfBMOQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=nMnOTIvrNMyD5AanrdDcDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=An Etymological Dictionary of Modern English: In Two Volumes – Ernest Weekley – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The origin is from the medieval times.

==In French-speaking countries==
[[File:Goemaer detail cremaillere.gif|thumb|{{Interlanguage link multi|Joos Goemare|fr}} detail crémaillière (from ''Le Christ chez Marthe et Marie, circa 1600'']]

A housewarming party is called a ''pendaison de crémaillère'', literally "hanging of the chimney hook". The expression comes from medieval times. When the construction of the house was finished, it was customary to invite all those who participated in its building to eat dinner as a vote of thanks. The food was prepared in a large pot, the temperature of which was controlled by a chimney hook, which could adjust the pot so it sat higher or lower over the fireplace. This hook was the last thing to be installed in the new house, marking the beginning of the thank you meal.

==Variations==
===Regional===
* In [[India]], this ceremony is known as "Gruha Pravesh" (गृह प्रवेश in [[Devanagari]]) or புதுமனை புகு விழா/Pudumanai Pugu vizha (Tamil) or "Gruha Pravesam" "గృహప్రవేశం" (Telugu) or "ಗೃಹ ಪ್ರವೇಶ" (Kannada)  literally meaning "Entering New House" (for the first time). In some places, they allow a cow (sacred animal among the Hindus) to be the first to enter the house, as the first part of the ceremony. The ceremony usually involves ''VastuShant'' (वास्तुशांत in [[Devanagari]]).
* In [[New Zealand]], the [[United Kingdom]], and other [[Commonwealth countries]], a housewarming party may also be known as a [[Apartment|flat]]warming party, usually in a shared living situation involving [[Roommate|flatmates]].
* The traditional [[Thailand|Thai]] housewarming is a Buddhist ritual in which monks, family, friends, and food all play important roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.templeofthai.com/asian-food-life/blog/tradtion-and-culture/housewarming-ceremony-blessing/ |title=Thai Housewarming Ceremony – Monks, Family, Friends &amp; Food » Temple of Thai Food |publisher=Templeofthai.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the [[American South|Southern United States]], an old-fashioned type of party, known as a "Food Pounder", is popular. Traditionally, each guest would bring the new homeowners a pound of food such as cheese, cornmeal, flour, sugar, or any other staple food needed to stock the new home's pantry. In modern times the tradition has been extended to canned goods and even fresh foods, but the hosts are still most likely to receive the basic foodstuffs needed to set up a kitchen.{{cn|date=August 2015}}
* In [[Russia]] and former [[USSR]] countries, it is believed that it is a cat who should be let to enter the new house first, which will bring home and family luck.

===Other===
* A housewarming party may be thrown upon completion of [[renovation]] or [[Home improvement|remodel]].
* A housewarming party may be presented as an "open house" where people are free to come and go during a fixed window of time on a given day.
* A housewarming may involve a [[potluck]] meal.
* Some people invite all of their new neighbors to their housewarming.  This allows the hosts to meet their new community.
* In some communities, neighbors may bring the housewarming party to the new residents to welcome them.

'''Indigenous peoples in Brazil''' ({{lang-pt|povos indígenas no Brasil}}) or '''Indigenous Brazilians''' ({{lang-pt|indígenas brasileiros}}), comprise a large number of distinct [[ethnic groups]] who have inhabited what is now the country of [[Brazil]] since prior to the [[Europe]]an contact around 1500. Unlike [[Christopher Columbus]], who thought he had reached the [[East Indies]], the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], most notably [[Vasco da Gama]], had already reached India via the [[Indian Ocean|Indian Ocean route]] when they reached [[Brazil]].

Nevertheless, the word {{lang|pt|índios}} ("Indians") was by then established to designate the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|people of the New World]] and continues to be used today in the Portuguese language to designate these people, while a person from [[India]] is called {{lang|pt|indiano}} in order to distinguish the two.

At the time of European contact, some of the [[indigenous peoples|indigenous people]] were traditionally mostly semi-[[nomadic]] tribes who subsisted on [[hunting]], [[fishing]], [[hunter-gatherer|gathering]] and migrant [[agriculture]]. Many of the estimated 2,000 nations and tribes which existed in the 16th century suffered extinction as a consequence of the European settlement, and many were assimilated into the Brazilian [[population]].

The indigenous population was largely killed by European diseases, declining from a pre-Columbian high of millions to some 300,000 (1997), grouped into 200 tribes. However, the number could be much higher if the urban indigenous populations are counted in all the Brazilian cities today. A somewhat dated linguistic survey&lt;ref&gt;Rodrigues 1985&lt;/ref&gt; found 188 living [[Languages of Brazil|indigenous languages]] with 155,000 total speakers.

On January 18, 2007, [[Fundação Nacional do Índio|FUNAI]] reported that it had confirmed the presence of 67 different [[uncontacted peoples|uncontacted tribes]] in [[Brazil]], up from 40 in 2005. With this addition, Brazil has now surpassed [[New Guinea]] as the country having the largest number of uncontacted peoples in the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Brazilian indigenous people have made substantial and pervasive contributions to the world's medicine with knowledge used today by pharmaceutical corporations, material, and cultural development—such as the domestication of [[tobacco]] and [[cassava]].

In the last [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]] census (2010), 817,000 Brazilians classified themselves as [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]].

==Origins==
[[File:Parque Indígena do Xingu.jpg|thumb|right|[[Xingu (people)|Xingu]], an [[Indigenous territory (Brazil)|indigenous territory of Brazil]]]]
Questions about the original [[Prehistoric migration and settlement of the Americas from Asia|settlement of the Americas]] has produced a number of hypothetical models. The origins of these indigenous people are still a matter of dispute among [[Archaeology|archaeologists]].&lt;ref name="AshRobinson2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Patricia J. Ash|author2=David J. Robinson|title=The Emergence of Humans: An Exploration of the Evolutionary Timeline|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JUlSYsyC-NQC&amp;pg=PT289|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-119-96424-7|page=289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Migration into the continents===
[[Anthropology|Anthropological]] and [[Genetics|genetic]] evidence indicates that most Amerindian people descended from migrant people from [[North Asia]] ([[Siberia]]) who entered the Americas across the [[Bering Strait]] or along the western coast of North America in at least three separate waves. In Brazil, particularly, most native tribes who were living in the land by 1500 are thought to be descended from the first Siberian wave of migrants, who are believed to have crossed the [[Bering Land Bridge]] at the end of the last Ice Age, between 13,000 and 17,000 years before the present. A migrant wave would have taken some time after initial entry to reach present-day Brazil, probably entering the [[Amazon River]] basin from the Northwest. (The second and third migratory waves from Siberia, which are thought to have generated the [[Athabaskan]], [[Aleut peoples|Aleut]], [[Inuit]], and [[Yupik peoples|Yupik people]], apparently did not reach farther than the southern [[United States]] and [[Canada]], respectively).&lt;ref name="CordellLightfoot2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Linda S. Cordell|author2=Kent Lightfoot|author3=Francis McManamon|author4=George Milner|title=Archaeology in America: An Encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=arfWRW5OFVgC&amp;pg=RA3-PA249|volume=4|year=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-02189-3|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An analysis of [[Genetic history of indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindian Y-chromosome DNA]] indicates specific clustering of much of the South American population. The [[Microsatellite (genetics)|micro-satellite]] diversity and distributions of the Y lineage specific to South America indicates that certain Amerindian populations have been isolated since the initial colonization of the region.&lt;ref name=subclades&gt;{{cite web

===Genetic studies===
{{further information| Genetic history of indigenous peoples of the Americas}}
[[File:Indios apiaka no rio Arinos.jpg|thumb|[[Apiacá people]], painted by [[Hércules Florence]], 1827]]
According to an autosomal genetic study from 2012,&lt;ref name="nature.com"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v488/n7411/abs/nature11258.html|title=Reconstructing Native American population history|accessdate=10 November 2015 | volume=488|doi=10.1038/nature11258|journal=Nature|pages=370–374|pmc=3615710|bibcode=2012Natur.488..370R|pmid=22801491|year=2012 | last1 = Reich | first1 = D | last2 = Patterson | first2 = N | last3 = Campbell | first3 = D | last4 = Tandon | first4 = A | last5 = Mazieres | first5 = S | last6 = Ray | first6 = N | last7 = Parra | first7 = MV | last8 = Rojas | first8 = W | last9 = Duque | first9 = C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Native Americans descend from at least three main migrant waves from East Asia. Most of it is traced back to a single ancestral population, called 'First Americans'. However, those who speak [[Inuit languages]] from the [[Arctic]] inherited almost half of their ancestry from a second East Asian migrant wave. And those who speak [[Na-dene]], on the other hand, inherited a tenth of their ancestry from a third migrant wave. The initial settling of the Americas was followed by a rapid expansion southwards, by the coast, with little gene flow later, especially in [[South America]]. One exception to this are the [[Chibcha]] speakers, whose ancestry comes from both North and South America.
&lt;ref name="nature.com"/&gt;

Another study, focused on the mtDNA (that which is inherited only through the maternal line),&lt;ref name="plosone.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000829?imageURI=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000829.g002|title=PLOS ONE|work=plosone.org|accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; revealed that the indigenous people of the Americas have their maternal ancestry traced back to a few founding lineages from East Asia, which would have arrived via the [[Bering strait]]. According to this study, it is probable that the ancestors of the Native Americans would have remained for a time in the region of the [[Bering Strait]], after which there would have been a rapid movement of settling of the Americas, taking the founding lineages to [[South America]].

Linguistic studies have backed up genetic studies, with ancient patterns having been found between the languages spoken in [[Siberia]] and those spoken in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0045198 Abstract Profiles of Structural Stability Point to Universal Tendencies, Family-Specific Factors, and Ancient Connections between Languages, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two 2015 autosomal DNA genetic studies confirmed the Siberian origins of the Natives of the Americas. However an ancient signal of shared ancestry with the Natives of Australia and Melanesia was detected among the Natives of the [[Amazon region]]. The migration coming out of [[Siberia]] would have happened 23,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencemag.org/content/349/6250/aab3884.abstract|title=Genomic evidence for the Pleistocene and recent population history of Native Americans| author=Raghavan |format=pdf |work= |date=21 August 2015|access-date=6 October 2015 |quote= |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v525/n7567/full/nature14895.html |title=Genetic evidence for two founding populations of the Americas|format=pdf |date=21 July 2015|access-date=7 October 2015 |doi=10.1038/nature14895 |volume=525 |journal=Nature|pmc=4982469 |pmid=26196601 |pages=104–8 | last1 = Skoglund | first1 = P | last2 = Mallick | first2 = S | last3 = Bortolini | first3 = MC | last4 = Chennagiri | first4 = N | last5 = Hünemeier | first5 = T | last6 = Petzl-Erler | first6 = ML | last7 = Salzano | first7 = FM | last8 = Patterson | first8 = N | last9 = Reich | first9 = D|bibcode=2015Natur.525..104S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Skoglund2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Skoglund|first1= P.|last2= Reich|first2= D.|title=A genomic view of the peopling of the Americas|journal= Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development|volume= 41|year= 2016|pages= 27–35|doi= 10.1016/j.gde.2016.06.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2016 study, focused on mtDNA lineages, "a small population entered the Americas via a coastal route around 16.0 ka, following previous isolation in eastern Beringia for ~2.4 to 9 thousand years after separation from eastern Siberian populations. Following a rapid movement throughout the Americas, limited gene flow in South America resulted in a marked phylogeographic structure of populations, which persisted through time. All of the ancient mitochondrial lineages detected in this study were absent from modern data sets, suggesting a high extinction rate. To investigate this further, we applied a novel principal components multiple logistic regression
test to Bayesian serial coalescent simulations. The analysis supported a scenario in which European colonization caused a substantial loss of pre-Columbian lineages".&lt;ref&gt;[http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/advances/2/4/e1501385.full.pdf Ancient mitochondrial DNA provides high-resolution time scale of the peopling of the Americas, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaeological remains===
[[File:Índios da etnia Terena2.jpg|thumb|right|Terena people]]
Brazilian native people, unlike those in [[Mesoamerica]] and the western [[Andes]], did not keep written records or erect stone monuments, and the humid climate and acidic soil have destroyed almost all traces of their material culture, including [[wood]] and [[bone]]s. Therefore, what is known about the region's history before 1500 has been inferred and reconstructed from small-scale archaeological evidence, such as [[Indigenous ceramics of the Americas|ceramics]] and stone [[arrowhead]]s.

The most conspicuous remains of these societies are very large mounds of discarded [[shellfish]] (''sambaquis'') found in some coastal sites which were continuously inhabited for over 5,000 years; and the substantial "black earth" (''[[terra preta]]'') deposits in several places along the Amazon, which are believed to be ancient garbage dumps ([[midden]]s). Recent excavations of such deposits in the middle and upper course of the Amazon have uncovered remains of some very large settlements, containing tens of thousands of homes, indicating a complex social and economic structure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amazonia.org.br/noticias/print.cfm?id=2691 Deposits in several places along the Amazon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928200701/http://www.amazonia.org.br/noticias/print.cfm?id=2691 |date=28 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marajoara culture]] flourished on [[Marajó|Marajó island]] at the mouth of the [[Amazon River]].&lt;ref name=Mann&gt;{{cite book |last=Mann |first=Charles C. |authorlink=Charles C. Mann |title=1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus |origyear=2005 |year=2006 |publisher=Vintage Books |pages=326–333 |isbn=1-4000-3205-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archeologists have found sophisticated [[pottery]] in their excavations on the island. These pieces are large, and elaborately painted and incised with representations of plants and animals. These provided the first evidence that a complex society had existed on Marajó. Evidence of [[mound building]] further suggests that well-populated, complex and sophisticated settlements developed on this island, as only such settlements were believed capable of such extended projects as major earthworks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grann|first=David|title=The Lost City of Z: A Tale of Deadly Obsession in the Amazon|page=315|year=2009|isbn=978-0-385-51353-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extent, level of complexity, and resource interactions of the Marajoara culture have been disputed. Working in the 1950s in some of her earliest research, American [[Betty Meggers]] suggested that the society migrated from the Andes and settled on the island. Many researchers believed that the Andes were populated by Paleoindian migrants from North America who gradually moved south after being hunters on the plains.

In the 1980s, another American archeologist, [[Anna Curtenius Roosevelt]], led excavations and geophysical surveys of the mound Teso dos Bichos. She concluded that the society that constructed the mounds originated on the island itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roosevelt|first=Anna C.|title=Moundbuilders of the Amazon: Geophysical Archaeology on Marajó Island, Brazil|publisher= Academic Press |year= 1991 |isbn=978-0-125-95348-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pre-Columbian culture of Marajó may have developed [[social stratification]] and supported a population as large as 100,000 people.&lt;ref name="Mann" /&gt; The Native Americans of the Amazon rain forest may have used their method of developing and working in [[Terra preta]] to make the land suitable for the large-scale agriculture needed to support large populations and complex social formations such as [[chiefdoms]].&lt;ref name="Mann" /&gt;

==Native people after the European colonization==

=== Distribution ===
[[File:Map of indigenous peoples of Brazil (16th C.).jpg|thumb|right|Distribution of Tupi and Tapuia people on the coast of Brazil, on the eve of colonialism in the 16th century]]
On the eve of the [[2nd Portuguese India Armada (Cabral, 1500)|Portuguese arrival]] in 1500, the coastal areas of Brazil had two major mega-groups - the ''[[Tupí people|Tupi]]'' (speakers of [[Tupi–Guarani languages]]), who dominated practically the entire length of the Brazilian coast, and the ''Tapuia'' (a catch-all term for non-Tupis, usually [[Jê language]] people), who resided primarily in the interior. The Portuguese arrived in the final days of a long pre-colonial struggle between Tupis and Tapuias, which had resulted in the defeat and expulsion of the Tapuias from most coastal areas.

Although the coastal Tupi were broken down into sub-tribes, frequently hostile to each other, they were culturally and linguistically homogeneous. The fact that the early Europeans encountered practically the same people and language all along the Brazilian coast greatly simplified early communication and interaction.

Coastal Sequence c. 1500 (north to south):&lt;ref&gt;Boundary details are partly derived from [http://www.arara.fr/BBTRIBOS.html Tribos Indígenas Brasileiras]&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''[[Tupinambá people|Tupinambá]]''' (Tupi, from the [[Amazon River|Amazon]] delta to [[Maranhão]])
# '''[[Tremembé people|Tremembé]]''' (Tapuia, coastal tribe, ranged from [[São Luis Island]] (south Maranhão) to the mouth of the [[Acaraú River]] in north [[Ceará]]; French traders cultivated an alliance with them)
# '''[[Potiguara people|Potiguara]]''' (Tupi, literally "shrimp-eaters"; they had a reputation as great canoeists and aggressively expansionist, inhabited a great coastal stretch from [[Acaraú River]] to [[Itamaracá]] island, covering the modern states of southern Ceará, Rio Grande do Norte and Paraíba.)
# '''[[Tabajara]]''' (tiny Tupi tribe between Itamaracá island and [[Paraíba do Norte River|Paraíba River]]; neighbors and frequent victims of the Potiguara)
# '''[[Caeté people|Caeté]]''' (Tupi group in [[Pernambuco]] and [[Alagoas]], ranged from [[Paraíba do Meio River|Paraíba River]] to the [[São Francisco River]]; after killing and eating a Portuguese bishop, they were subjected to Portuguese extermination raids and the remnant pushed into the Pará interior)
# '''[[Tupinambá people|Tupinambá]]''' again (Tupi par excellence, ranged from the São Francisco River to the [[Bay of All Saints]], population estimated as high as 100,000; hosted Portuguese castaway [[Caramuru]])
# '''[[Tupiniquim]]''' (Tupi, covered [[Bahia]]n [[Bahia#The Discovery Coast|discovery coast]], from around [[Camamu]] to [[São Mateus River]]; these were the first indigenous people encountered by the Portuguese, having met the landing of captain [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] in April 1500)
# '''[[Botocudo people|Aimoré]]''' (Tapuia (Jê) tribe; concentrated on a sliver of coast in modern [[Espírito Santo]] state)
# '''[[Goitacá people|Goitacá]]''' (Tapuia tribe; once dominated the coast from [[São Mateus River]] (in Espírito Santo state) down to the [[Paraíba do Sul]] river (in [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] state); hunter-gatherers and fishermen, they were a shy people that avoided all contact with foreigners; estimated at 12,000; they had a fearsome reputation and were eventually annihilated by European colonists)
# '''[[Temiminó]]''' (small Tupi tribe, centered on [[Governador Island]] in [[Guanabara Bay]]; frequently at war with the Tamoio around them)
# '''[[Tamoio]]''' (Tupi, old branch of the Tupinambá, ranged from the western edge of Guanabara bay to [[Ilha Grande]])
# '''[[Tupinambá people|Tupinambá]]''' again (Tupi, indistinct from the Tamoio. Inhabited the Paulist coast, from Ilha Grande to [[Santos, São Paulo|Santos]]; main enemies of the Tupiniquim to their west. Numbered between six and ten thousand).
# '''[[Tupiniquim]]''' again (Tupi, on the [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] coast from Santos/Bertioga down to [[Cananéia]]; aggressively expansionist, they were recent arrivals imposing themselves on the Paulist coast and the [[Piratininga]] plateau at the expense of older Tupinambá and Carijó neighbors; hosted Portuguese castaways [[João Ramalho]] ('Tamarutaca') and António Rodrigues in the early 1500s; the Tupiniquim were the first formal allies of the Portuguese colonists, helped establish the Portuguese [[Captaincy of São Vicente]] in the 1530s; sometimes called "Guaianá" in old Portuguese chronicles, a Tupi term meaning "friendly" or "allied")
# '''[[Carijó]]''' (Guarani (Tupi) tribe, ranged from Cananeia all the way down to [[Lagoa dos Patos]] (in [[Rio Grande do Sul]] state); victims of the Tupiniquim and early European slavers; they hosted the mysterious ''[[degredado]]'' known as the '[[Bachelor of Cananeia]]')
# '''[[Charrúa]]''' (Tapuia (Jê) tribe in modern [[Uruguay]] coast, with an aggressive reputation against intruders; killed [[Juan Díaz de Solís]] in 1516)

With the exception of the [[hunter-gatherer]] [[Goitacases]], the coastal Tupi and Tapuia tribes were primarily agriculturalists. The subtropical Guarani cultivated [[maize]], tropical Tupi cultivated manioc ([[cassava]]), highland Jês cultivated [[peanut]], as the staple of their diet. Supplementary crops included [[bean]]s, [[sweet potato]]es, cará ([[Yam (vegetable)|yam]]), ''jerimum'' ([[pumpkin]]), and ''cumari'' ([[capsicum]] pepper).

Behind these coasts, the interior of Brazil was dominated primarily by Tapuia (Jê) people, although significant sections of the interior (notably the upper reaches of the [[Xingu River|Xingu]], [[Teles Pires]] and [[Juruena River]]s - the area now covered roughly by modern [[Mato Grosso]] state) were the original pre-migration Tupi-Guarani homelands.  Besides the Tupi and Tapuia, it is common to identify two other indigenous mega-groups in the interior: the [[Kalina people|Caribs]], who inhabited much of what is now northwestern Brazil, including both shores of the [[Amazon River]] up to the delta and the [[Nuaraque]] group, whose constituent tribes inhabited several areas, including most of the upper Amazon (west of what is now [[Manaus]]) and also significant pockets in modern [[Amapá]] and [[Roraima]] states.

The names by which the different Tupi tribes were recorded by Portuguese and French authors of the 16th century are poorly understood. Most do not seem to be proper names, but descriptions of relationship, usually familial - e.g. ''tupi'' means "first father", ''tupinambá'' means "relatives of the ancestors", ''tupiniquim'' means "side-neighbors", ''tamoio'' means "grandfather", ''temiminó'' means "grandson", ''tabajara'' means "in-laws" and so on.&lt;ref&gt;M. Pereira Gomes, ''The Indians and Brazil'', p.32&lt;/ref&gt;  Some etymologists believe these names reflect the ordering of the migration waves of Tupi people from the interior to the coasts, e.g. first Tupi wave to reach the coast being the "grandfathers" (Tamoio), soon joined by the "relatives of the ancients" (Tupinamba), by which it could mean relatives of the Tamoio, or a Tamoio term to refer to relatives of the old Tupi back in the upper Amazon basin. The "grandsons" (Temiminó) might be a splinter. The "side-neighbors" (Tupiniquim) meant perhaps recent arrivals, still trying to jostle their way in. However, by 1870 the Tupi tribes population had declined to 250,000 indígenas and by 1890 had diminished to an approximate 100,000 tribes.

===First contacts===
[[File:Os Filhos de Pindorama. Cannibalism in Brazil in 1557.jpg|thumb|Depiction of [[cannibalism]] in the Brazilian Tupinambá tribe, as described by [[Hans Staden]].]]
[[File:Dança dos Tapuias.jpg|thumb|[[Albert Eckhout]] (Dutch), [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil#Native people after the European colonization|Tapuias]] (Brazil) dancing, 17th c.]]

When the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] explorers first arrived in Brazil in April 1500, they found, to their astonishment, a wide coastline rich in resources, teeming with hundreds of thousands of Indigenous people living in a "paradise" of natural riches. [[Pêro Vaz de Caminha]], the official scribe of [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]], the commander of the discovery fleet which landed in the present state of [[Bahia]], wrote a letter to the King of Portugal describing in glowing terms the beauty of the land.

At the time of European arrival, the territory of current day Brazil had as many as 2,000 nations and tribes. The indigenous people were traditionally mostly semi-nomadic tribes who subsisted on hunting, fishing, gathering, and migrant agriculture. For hundreds of years, the indigenous people of Brazil lived a semi-nomadic life, managing the forests to meet their needs. When the Portuguese arrived in 1500, the natives were living mainly on the coast and along the banks of major rivers. Initially, the Europeans saw native people as [[noble savage]]s, and [[miscegenation]] of the population began right away. Portuguese claims of tribal warfare, [[cannibalism]], and the pursuit of Amazonian [[brazilwood]] for its treasured red dye convinced the Portuguese that they should "civilize" the natives (originally, colonists called Brazil [[Terra de Santa Cruz]], until later it acquired its name (see [[List of meanings of countries' names]]) from [[brazilwood]]). But the Portuguese, like the Spanish in their North American territories, had brought diseases with them against which many Indians were helpless due to lack of immunity. [[Measles]], [[smallpox]], [[tuberculosis]], and [[influenza]] killed tens of thousands. The diseases spread quickly along the indigenous trade routes, and it is likely that whole tribes were annihilated without ever coming in direct contact with Europeans.

===Slavery and the bandeiras===
[[File:Famille d’un Chef Camacan se préparant pour une Fête.jpg|thumb|right|Brazilian Indians during a ritual, [[Debret]]]]
The mutual feeling of wonderment and good relationship was to end in the succeeding years.
The Portuguese [[colonist]]s, all males, started to have children with female Amerindians, creating a new generation of mixed-race people who spoke Indian languages (a [[Tupi language]] called [[Nheengatu language|Nheengatu]]). The children of these Portuguese men and Indian women formed the majority of the population. Groups of fierce pathfinders organized expeditions called "[[Bandeirantes|bandeiras]]" (flags) into the backlands to claim them for the Portuguese crown and to look for [[gold]] and [[precious stone]]s.

Intending to profit from the [[sugar trade]], the Portuguese decided to plant [[sugar cane]] in Brazil, and to use indigenous slaves as the workforce, as the Spanish colonies were successfully doing. But the indigenous people were hard to capture. They were soon  infected by diseases brought by the Europeans against which they had no natural [[immune system|immunity]], and began dying in great numbers.

===The Jesuits: Protectors of the Indians===
{{Main article|Jesuit Reductions}}
[[File:Indigenous brazil.jpg|thumb|right|Map of [[Indigenous territory (Brazil)|indigenous territories]] in Brazil.]]
The [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priests, who had come with the first [[Governor General]] to provide religious assistance to the colonists, but mainly to convert the [[Paganism|Pagan]] people to [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], took the side of the Indians and extracted a Papal [[papal bull|bull]] stating that they were human and should be protected.

Jesuit priests such as fathers [[José de Anchieta]] and [[Manuel da Nóbrega]] studied and recorded their language and founded mixed settlements, such as [[São Paulo dos Campos de Piratininga]], where colonists and Indians lived side by side, speaking the same ''[[Língua Geral]]'' (common language) and freely intermarried. They began also to establish more remote villages peopled only by "civilized" Indians, called ''Missions'', or [[Indian Reductions|reductions]] (see the article on the [[Guarani people]] for more details).

By the middle of the 16th century, Catholic [[Jesuit]] priests, at the behest of Portugal's monarchy, had established missions throughout the country's colonies. They became protectors of the Indians and worked to both Europeanize them and convert them to [[Catholicism]]. The Jesuits provided a period of relative stability for the Indians.

In the mid-1770s, the Indians' fragile co-existence with the colonists was again threatened. Because of a complex diplomatic web between [[Portugal]], [[Spain]] and the [[Vatican City|Vatican]], the Jesuits were expelled from Brazil and the missions confiscated and sold.

By 1800, the population of Brazil had reached approximately 3.25 million, of which only 250,000 were [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]]. And for the next four decades, the Indians were largely left alone.

===Wars===
[[File:Debret2.jpg|thumb|right|A Tamoio Warrior depicted by [[Jean-Baptiste Debret]] in the early 19th century.]]
A number of wars between several tribes, such as the [[Tamoio Confederation]], and the Portuguese ensued, sometimes with the Indians siding with enemies of Portugal, such as the French, in the famous episode of [[France Antarctique]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], sometimes allying themselves to Portugal in their fight against other tribes. At approximately the same period, a German soldier, [[Hans Staden]], was captured by the [[Tupinambá people|Tupinambá]] and released after a while. He described it in a famous book, ''Warhaftige Historia und beschreibung eyner Landtschafft der Wilden Nacketen, Grimmigen Menschfresser-Leuthen in der Newenwelt America gelegen'' (True Story and Description of a Country of Wild, Naked, Grim, Man-eating People in the New World, America) (1557)

There are various documented accounts of [[smallpox]] being knowingly used as a biological weapon by New Brazilian villagers that wanted to get rid of nearby Indian tribes (not always aggressive ones). The most "classical", according to Anthropologist, Mércio Pereira Gomes, happened in Caxias, in south Maranhão, where local farmers, wanting more land to extend their cattle farms, gave clothing owned by ill villagers (that normally would be burned to prevent further infection) to the Timbira. The clothing infected the entire tribe, and they had neither immunity nor cure. Similar things happened in other villages throughout South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socioambiental.org/noticias/nsa/nsa/detalhe?id=64|title=Notícias socioambientais :: Socioambiental|work=socioambiental.org|accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The rubber trade===
The 1840s brought trade and wealth to the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]]. The process for [[vulcanization|vulcanizing]] [[rubber]] was developed, and worldwide demand for the product skyrocketed. The best [[rubber tree]]s in the world grew in the Amazon, and thousands of rubber tappers began to work the plantations. When the Indians proved to be a difficult labor force, peasants from surrounding areas were brought into the region. In a dynamic that continues to this day, the indigenous population was at constant odds with the peasants, who the Indians felt had invaded their lands in search of treasure.

===The legacy of Cândido Rondon===
[[File:Cândido Rondon.jpg|thumb|Marshal [[Cândido Rondon]].]]
In the 20th century, the Brazilian Government adopted a more humanitarian attitude and offered official protection to the indigenous people, including the establishment of the first indigenous reserves. Fortune brightened for the Indians around the turn of the 20th century when [[Cândido Rondon]], a man of both [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] and [[Bororo (Brazil)|Bororo]] ancestry, and an explorer and progressive officer in the Brazilian army, began working to gain the Indians' trust and establish peace. Rondon, who had been assigned to help bring telegraph communications into the Amazon, was a curious and natural explorer. In 1910, he helped found the ''Serviço de Proteção aos Índios - SPI'' (Service for the Protection of Indians, today the FUNAI, or ''[[Fundação Nacional do Índio]]'', National Foundation for Indians). SPI was the first federal agency charged with protecting Indians and preserving their culture. In 1914, Rondon accompanied [[Theodore Roosevelt]] on Roosevelt's famous expedition to map the Amazon and discover new species. During these travels, Rondon was appalled to see how settlers and developers treated the indigenes, and he became their lifelong friend and protector.

Rondon, who died in 1958, is a national hero in Brazil. The Brazilian state of [[Rondônia]] is named after him.

===SPI failure and FUNAI===
[[File:Indígena da etnia Tapirapé.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tapirapé people|Tapirapé]] woman painting the body.]]
After Rondon's pioneering work, the SPI was turned over to bureaucrats and military officers and its work declined after 1957. The new officials did not share Rondon's deep commitment to the Indians. SPI sought to address tribal issues by transforming the tribes into mainstream Brazilian society. The lure of reservation riches enticed cattle ranchers and settlers to continue their assault on Indians lands – and the SPI eased the way. Between 1900 and 1967, an estimated 98 [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] tribes were wiped out.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Mostly due to the efforts of the [[Villas-Bôas brothers]], Brazil's first Indian reserve, the [[Xingu National Park]], was established by the Federal Government in 1961.

During the social and political upheaval in the 1960s, reports of mistreatment of Indians increasingly reached [[Brazil]]'s [[urban center]]s and began to affect Brazilian thinking. In 1967, following the publication of the ''[[Figueiredo Report]]'', commissioned by the Ministry of the Interior, the military government launched an investigation into SPI. It soon came to light that the SPI was corrupt and failing to protect natives, their lands, and, culture. The 5,000-page report catalogued atrocities including slavery, sexual abuse, torture, and mass murder.&lt;ref name="urlFUNAI - National Indian Foundation (Brazil)"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.survivalinternational.org/about/funai
|title=FUNAI - National Indian Foundation (Brazil)
|format=|work=
|accessdate=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It has been charged that agency officials, in collaboration with land speculators, were systematically slaughtering the Indians by intentionally circulating disease-laced clothes.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}  Criminal prosecutions followed, and the SPI was disbanded. The same year the government established '''Fundação Nacional do Índio''' (''National Indian Foundation''), known as FUNAI which is responsible for protecting the interests, cultures, and rights of the Brazilian indigenous populations.
Some tribes have become significantly integrated into Brazilian society. The unacculturated tribes which have been contacted by FUNAI, are supposed to be protected and accommodated within Brazilian society in varying degrees. By 1987 it was recognized that unessential contact with the tribes was causing illness and social disintegration. The uncontacted tribes are now supposed to be protected from intrusion and interference in their life style and territory.&lt;ref name="urlFUNAI - National Indian Foundation (Brazil)" /&gt;
However, the exploitation of [[rubber]] and other Amazonic natural resources has led to a new cycle of invasion, expulsion, massacres and death, which continues to this day.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

===The military government===
Also in 1964, in a seismic political shift, the Brazilian military [[1964 Brazilian coup d'état|took control of the government]] and abolished all existing political parties, creating a two-party system. For the next two decades, Brazil was ruled by a series of generals. The country's mantra was "Brazil, the Country of the Future," which the military government used as justification for a giant push into the Amazon to exploit its resources, thereby beginning to transform Brazil into one of the leading economies of the world. Construction began on a [[Trans-Amazonian Highway|transcontinental highway]] across the Amazon basin, aimed to encourage migration to the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]] and to open up the region to more trade. With funding from World Bank, thousands of square miles of forest were cleared without regard for reservation status. After the highway projects came giant hydroelectric projects, then swaths of forest were cleared for cattle ranches. As a result, reservation lands suffered massive deforestation and flooding. The public works projects attracted very few migrants, but those few – and largely poor - settlers brought new diseases that further devastated the Indians population.

===Contemporary situation===
[[File:Índios isolados no Acre 12.jpg|thumb|250px|Members of an [[Uncontacted peoples|uncontacted tribe]] encountered in the Brazilian state of [[Acre (state)|Acre]] in 2009]]
The [[Constitution of Brazil|1988 Brazilian Constitution]] recognises indigenous people' right to pursue their traditional ways of life and to the permanent and exclusive possession of their "traditional lands", which are demarcated as [[Indigenous territory (Brazil)|Indigenous Territories]].&lt;ref name="constitution"&gt;Federal Constitution of Brazil.

Much of the language has been incorporated into the official Brazilian Portuguese language. For example, 'Carioca' the word used to describe people born in the city of Rio de Janeiro, is from the indigenous word for 'house of the white (people)'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dicionariotupiguarani.com.br/dicionario/carioca/ |title=Dicionário Ilustrado Tupi-Guarani |accessdate=14 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Indigenous Rights Movements ==

=== Urban Rights Movement ===
The urban rights movement is a recent development in the rights of indigenous peoples. Brazil has one of the highest income inequalities in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTPOVERTY/EXTPA/0,,contentMDK:20689430~menuPK:443285~pagePK:148956~piPK:216618~theSitePK:430367,00.html|title=Poverty Analysis - Brazil: Inequality and Economic Development in Brazil|website=web.worldbank.org|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and much of that population includes indigenous tribes migrating toward urban areas both by choice and by displacement. Beyond the urban rights movement, studies have shown that the suicide risk among the indigenous population is 8.1 times higher than the non-indigenous population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=1&amp;sid=43712ee8-c110-4d48-be3c-7674a6e53374@sessionmgr4010&amp;hid=4208&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmU=#AN=117900625&amp;db=a9h|title=Spatial-temporal trends and risk of suicide in Central Brazil: an ecologica...: Start Your Search!|website=eds.a.ebscohost.com|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many indigenous rights movements have been created through the meeting of many indigenous tribes in urban areas. For example, in Barcelos, an indigenous rights movement arose because of "local migratory circulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sobreiro|first=Thaissa|title=Can urban migration contribute to rural resistance? Indigenous mobilization in the Middle Rio Negro, Amazonas, Brazil|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/03066150.2014.993624|journal=The Journal of Peasant Studies|volume=42|issue=6|pages=1241–1261|doi=10.1080/03066150.2014.993624|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;" This is how many alliances form to create a stronger network for mobilization. Indigenous populations also living in urban areas have struggles regarding work. They are pressured into doing cheap labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Integration of the Indigenous Peoples of the Territory of Roraima, Brazil|last=Migliazza|first=Ernest|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Programs like Oxfam have been used to help indigenous people gain partnerships to begin grassroots movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Brazil|last=Rocha|first=Jan|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of their projects overlap with environmental activism as well.

Many Brazilian youths are mobilizing through the increased social contact, since some indigenous tribes stay isolated while others adapt to the change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indigenous Youth in Brazilian Amazonia: Changing Lived Worlds|last=Virtanen|first=Pirjo|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Access to education also affects these youths, and therefore, more groups are mobilizing to fight for indigenous rights.

=== Environmental and Territorial Rights Movement ===
Much of Indigenous tribes' rights parallel the environmental and territorial rights movement. Although indigenous people have gained 21% of the Brazilian Amazon as part of indigenous land, there are many issues still today that affect the sustainability of Indigenous territories today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=1&amp;sid=fc17c590-2d84-41cd-b013-5a22140e3d03@sessionmgr4008&amp;hid=4208&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmU=#AN=S1877343515000810&amp;db=edselp|title=The sustainability challenges of indigenous territories in Brazil's Amazoni...: Start Your Search!|website=eds.a.ebscohost.com|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmentalists and indigenous peoples have been viewed as opponents to economic growth and barriers to development&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhouri|first=Andréa|date=2010-09-01|title="Adverse Forces" in the Brazilian Amazon: Developmentalism Versus Environmentalism and Indigenous Rights|url=http://jed.sagepub.com/content/19/3/252|journal=The Journal of Environment &amp; Development|language=en|volume=19|issue=3|pages=252–273|doi=10.1177/1070496510378097|issn=1070-4965}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the fact that much of the land that indigenous tribes live on could be used for development projects and more industrialization. Currently, 15% of global greenhouse gas emissions can be attributed to forest clearing and degradation. Deforestation for mining also affects the daily lives of indigenous tribes in Brazil.&lt;ref name="Paixao 587–597"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paixao|first=Silvane|last2=Hespanha|first2=João P.|last3=Ghawana|first3=Tarun|last4=Carneiro|first4=Andrea F.T.|last5=Zevenbergen|first5=Jaap|last6=Frederico|first6=Lilian N.|date=2015-12-01|title=Modeling indigenous tribes’ land rights with ISO 19152 LADM: A case from Brazil|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285782840_Modeling_indigenous_tribes'_land_rights_with_ISO_19152_LADM_A_case_from_Brazil|journal=Land Use Policy|volume=49|pages=587–597|doi=10.1016/j.landusepol.2014.12.001|issn=0264-8377}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Munduruku Indians have higher levels of mercury poisoning due to gold production in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Oliveira Santos|first=Elisabeth C.|last2=Jesus|first2=Iracina Maura de|last3=Camara|first3=Volney de M.|last4=Brabo|first4=Edilson|last5=Loureiro|first5=Edvaldo C.

There are a lot of alliances between indigenous peoples and conservation organizations in the Brazilian Amazon.The A'ukre Kayapo village and the Instituto SocioAmbiental (ISA) environmental organization is a good example of one of these alliances. They focus on environmental, education and developmental rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schwartzman|first=Stephan|last2=Zimmerman|first2=Barbara|date=2005-06-01|title=Conservation Alliances with Indigenous Peoples of the Amazon|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2005.00695.x/abstract|journal=Conservation Biology|language=en|volume=19|issue=3|pages=721–727|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2005.00695.x|issn=1523-1739}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Amazon Watch collaborates with various indigenous organizations in Brazil to fight for both territorial and environmental rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Moving Environments: Affect, Emotion, Ecology, and Film|last=Weik von Mossner|first=Alexa|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Access to natural resources by indigenous and peasant communities in Brazil has been considerably less and much more insecure,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Compensation for Environmental Services and Rural Communities|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;" so activists focus on more traditional conservation efforts, and expanding territorial rights for indigenous people.

Territorial rights for the indigenous populations of Brazil largely fall under socio-economic issues. There have been violent conflicts regarding rights to land between the government and the indigenous population,&lt;ref name="Paixao 587–597"/&gt; and political rights have done little to stop them. There have been movements of the landless (MST) that helps keep land away from the elite living in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://estudogeral.sib.uc.pt/bitstream/10316/12123/1/law_and_globalization_from_below.pdf|title=Law and Globalization from Below|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ingush''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɪ|ŋ|g|ʊ|ʃ}}, {{lang-inh|ГIалгIай}}, {{transl|inh|''Ġalġay''}}, pronounced {{IPA-cau|ˈʁəlʁɑj|}}) are a [[Northeast Caucasian languages|Northeast Caucasian]] native [[ethnic group]] of the [[North Caucasus]], mostly inhabiting their native [[Ingushetia]], a federal republic of [[Russian Federation]]. The Ingush are predominantly [[Sunni]] [[Muslim]]s and speak the [[Ingush language]], a [[Northeast Caucasian language]] that is closely related to [[Chechen language|Chechen]]; the two form a [[dialect continuum]].&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, J. and Vagapov, A. D. (2004). ''Chechen-English and English-Chechen Dictionary'', p. 4. RoutledgeCurzon. {{ISBN|0-415-31594-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ingush and Chechen peoples are collectively known as the [[Nakh peoples]], although the genetics of Ingush and the Chechen indicate a split about 13,000-17,000 Ybp.&lt;ref&gt;Arutiunov, Sergei.

== History ==
{{Main|Ingushetia}}
[[Caucas]] is the legendary ancestor of the [[Vainakh]] (Chechen-Ingush).
Their name in [[Georgian language|Georgian]] is ''Ghlivi/Ghlighvi''. The ancient Greek author [[Strabo]] spoke about the ''Gargars'', while American cartographer [[Joseph Hutchins Colton]] labeled the people as ''Gelians''.

The Ingush came under Russian rule in 1810, but under Soviet rule during [[World War II]] they were suspected of collaborating with the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] and thus, the entire population was deported to the [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakh]] and [[Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic|Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republics]]. The Ingush were [[rehabilitate (Soviet)|rehabilitate]]d in the 1950s, after the death of [[Joseph Stalin]], and allowed to return home in 1957, though by that time western Ingush lands had been ceded to [[North Ossetia]].

==Culture==
The Ingush possess a varied culture of traditions, legends, epics, tales, songs, proverbs, and sayings. Music, songs and dance are particularly highly regarded. Popular musical instruments include the ''dachick-panderr'' (a kind of [[balalaika]]), ''kekhat ponder'' ([[accordion]], generally played by girls), mirz ponder (a three-stringed violin), [[zurna]] (a type of [[oboe]]), [[tambourine]], and drums.

==Religion==
The Ingush are predominantly [[Sunni]] [[Muslim]]s of the [[Shāfi‘ī]] [[Madh'hab]], although a [[Sufi]] minority exists.&lt;ref name="Allievi"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Stefano Allievi |author2=Jørgen S. Nielsen |title=Muslim networks and transnational communities in and across Europe |volume=1 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ingush genetics==
{{see|Vainakh#Genetics|Genetic history of the Caucasus}}
{{Pull quote|text=The Caucasus populations exhibit, on average, less variability than other populations for the eight Alu insertion poly-morphisms analysed here. The average heterozygosity is less than that for any other region of the world, with the exception of Sahul. Within the Caucasus, Ingushians have much lower levels of variability than any of the other populations. The Ingushians also showed unusual patterns of [[mtDNA]] variation when compared with other Caucasus populations (Nasidze and Stoneking, submitted), which indicates that some feature of the Ingushian population history, or of this particular sample of Ingushians, must be responsible for their different patterns of [[genetic variation]] at both mtDNA and the [[Alu sequence|Alu]] insertion loci.&lt;ref name="European Journal of Human Genetics"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ivane Nasidze|year=2001 |title=Alu insertion polymorphisms and the genetic structure of human populations from the Caucasus |journal=[[European Journal of Human Genetics]] |volume=9 |pages=267–272 |doi=10.1038/sj.ejhg.5200615 |pmid=11313770 |issue=4|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nature"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/ejhg/journal/v9/n4/pdf/5200615a.pdf|title=Alu insertion polymorphisms and the genetic structure of human populations from the Caucasus|format=PDF | volume=9|doi=10.1038/sj.ejhg.5200615|pmid=11313770|date=April 2001|journal=Eur.

According to one test by Nasidze in 2003 (analyzed further in 2004), the Y-chromosome structure of the Ingush greatly resembled that of neighboring Caucasian populations (especially Chechens, their linguistic and cultural brethren).&lt;ref name="Nasidze2003"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nasidze I, Sarkisian T, Kerimov A, Stoneking M |title=Testing hypotheses of language replacement in the Caucasus: evidence from the Y-chromosome |journal=Human Genetics |volume=112 |issue=3 |pages=255–61 |date=March 2003 |pmid=12596050 |doi=10.1007/s00439-002-0874-4 |url=http://www.familytreedna.com/pdf/Nasidze_2003.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nasidze2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nasidze |first1=I. |last2=Ling |first2=E.

S. |last3=Quinque |first3=D. |display-authors=3 |last4=et al |year=2004 |title=Mitochondrial DNA and Y-Chromosome Variation in the Caucasus |url=http://www.eva.mpg.de/genetics/pdf/Caucasus_big_paper.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Annals of Human Genetics |volume=68 |issue= |pages=205–221 |doi=10.1046/j.1529-8817.2004.00092.x |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608081424/http://www.eva.mpg.de/genetics/pdf/Caucasus_big_paper.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been only one notable study on the Ingush Y chromosome. These following statistics should not be regarded as final, as Nasidze's test had a notably low sample data for the Ingush. However, they do give an idea of the main haplogroups of the Ingush.

* [[Haplogroup J2 (Y-DNA)|J2]] – '''89%''' of Ingush have the highest reported frequency of J2 which is associated with the [[Fertile Crescent]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
* [[Haplogroup F*(Y-DNA)|F*]] – ('''11%''' of Ingush)&lt;ref name="Nasidze2004"/&gt; This haplogroup was called "F*" by Nasidze. It may have actually been any haplogroup under F that was not under G, I, J2, or K; however, it is probably consists of haplotypes that are either under J1 (typical of the region, with very high frequencies in parts of Dagestan, as well as Arabia, albeit in a different subclade) or F3.
* [[Haplogroup G (Y-DNA)|G]] – ('''27%''' of Ingush)&lt;ref name="Nasidze2004"/&gt; Typical of the Middle East, the Mediterranean and the Caucasus. The highest values were found among Georgians, Circassians and Ossetes. There was a noticeable difference in G between Ingush and Chechens (in J2 and F*, Ingush and Chechens have similar levels), possibly attributable to low samples that were all from the same town.

In the mtDNA, the Ingush formed a more clearly distinct population, with distance from other populations. The closest in an analysis by Nasidze were Chechens, [[Kabarday|Kabardins]] and [[Adyghe people|Adyghe]] (Circassians), but these were all much closer to other populations than they were to the Ingush.&lt;ref name="Nasidze2004"/&gt;

(2012) {{ISBN|978-1937856380}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was the [[Defense attorney|lead attorney]] for [[Death of Caylee Anthony|Casey Anthony]], who was acquitted of murder in July 2011 after a trial that attracted national and international attention.  Baez authored a book with [[Peter Golenbock]] about the case, ''Presumed Guilty'', which became a [[New York Times Best Seller]].

==Early life and education==
Baez was born to [[Puerto Ricans|Puerto Rican]] parents in Manhattan, N.Y.,&lt;ref name="ABC News"/&gt; and raised in [[the Bronx]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[South Florida]] with his three sisters by his single mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author = Carolyn Salazar| title =José Baez, Casey Anthony's Lawyer: From Troubled Son to Star Defense Attorney| quote = Baez was born in Puerto Rico and grew up in Bronx, N.Y., and South Florida with his single mother.

By Nikki Battiste and Kimberly Brown, July 6, 2011. During the 2nd segment at video index 03:09, Baez says he was born in Manhattan. Other sources reported his place of birth as Puerto Rico, such as:

He married and became a father at age 17.&lt;ref name=ABCJuly52011/&gt; After earning his [[General Equivalency Diploma]] (GED), he joined the [[U.S. Navy]] in 1986. According to his resume, he spent three years assigned in connection with [[NATO]] at [[Norfolk, Virginia]], trained as an intelligence analyst, and held a Top Secret [[security clearance]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.terra.com/latin-in-america/news/exclusive_interview_with_casey_anthonys_lawyer_jose_baez/hof15569 "Exclusive Casey Anthony Lawyer Jose Baez Interview"], ''Terra'', June 22, 2020
.&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving the Navy in 1989, Baez attended [[Miami-Dade Community College]], then transferred to [[Florida State University]] where he earned a BA. He earned his [[Juris Doctor]] degree from [[St. Thomas University School of Law]] in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author = Carolyn Salazar| title =José Baez, Casey Anthony's Lawyer: From Troubled Son to Star Defense Attorney| quote =| newspaper =[[Fox News]] Latino| date =July 5, 2011| url =http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2011/07/05/jose-baez-casey-anthonys-lawyer-from-troubled-son-to-star-defense-attorney/| accessdate =May 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After graduating from law school in 1997, Baez was denied admission to the Florida Bar due to financial irresponsibility.&lt;ref name=ABC-Trials&gt;{{cite news|last=Hopper|first=Jessica|title=Casey Anthony's Lawyer Jose Baez Has Trials of His Own|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/casey-anthony-trial-defense-attorney-jose-baez/story?id=13784113#.UEZWlI1mR4c|date=8 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Curtis-OS&gt;{{cite web|last=Curtis|first=Henry P.|title=Casey Anthony's lawyer, Jose Baez, rejected by Florida Bar on first try|url=http://www.tcpalm.com/news/2009/may/03/casey-anthonys-lawyer-jose-baez-rejected-florida-b/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205012212/http://www.tcpalm.com/news/2009/may/03/casey-anthonys-lawyer-jose-baez-rejected-florida-b/|archivedate=5 December 2013|publisher=Orlando Sentinel|accessdate=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unable to practice as an attorney, he worked instead as an intern at the Miami Dade Public Defender's office and owned several companies. In 2005, the Florida Board of Bar Examiners admitted Baez after he had demonstrated that he had rehabilitated himself.&lt;ref name=Curtis-OS/&gt;

===Criminal cases===
After being granted his license, he focused primarily on criminal defense cases, including the case of Elvira Garcia, an undocumented Mexican immigrant accused of kidnapping a child that she had adopted as her own. Garcia's charges were dropped, as it turned out to be more of a civil custody matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wftv.com/news/news/roommate-charged-with-kidnapping-6-week-old-boy/nJsdr/ |title=Roommate Charged With Kidnapping 6-Week-Old Boy |publisher=www.wftv.com |date=2006-09-27 |accessdate=2013-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wesh.com/news/casey-anthony-extended-coverage/Who-Is-Jose-Baez/-/13479888/13176420/-/item/0/-/fj5899/-/index.html |title=Who Is Jose Baez? &amp;#124; Casey Anthony – WESH Home |publisher=Wesh.com |date=2008-08-04 |accessdate=2013-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also tried the first-degree murder case of Nilton Diaz, heavily covered by the media in Orlando and Puerto Rico because the victim was the 2-year-old granddaughter of World Boxing Champion [[Wilfredo Vazquez]].&lt;ref name=Hudak20080429&gt;{{cite web|last=Hudak|first=Stephen|title=Nilton Diaz denies killing girl, 2, in Lake County murder trial|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2008-04-29/news/ldiaz29_1_diaz-tavares-child|publisher=Orlando Sentinel|accessdate=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Diaz was acquitted of first and second degree murder but convicted of manslaughter and child abuse.

Baez came to significant national attention when he took on the [[Death of Caylee Anthony|case of Casey Anthony]]. Time Magazine dubbed it "the Social Media Trial of the Century".&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2077969,00.html|title=Casey Anthony Murder Case: Social-Media Trial of Century – TIME|publisher=content.time.com|accessdate=2014-03-22|date=2011-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthony was acquitted of the murder of her daughter, Caylee, after a trial that lasted six weeks. In a press conference on the day of the verdict, Baez said, "While we're happy for Casey, there are no winners in this case. Caylee has passed on far, far too soon, and what my driving force has been for the last three years has been always to make sure that there has been justice for Caylee and Casey because Casey did not murder Caylee. It's that simple." He added, "And today our system of justice has not dishonored her memory by a false conviction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Kyle|last=Hightower|title=Jurors see scant evidence in Casey Anthony trial|publisher=MSNBC/''Associated Press''|date=July 2, 2011|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/43617797/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/t/jurors-see-scant-evidence-casey-anthony-trial/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baez was featured on every major news network and show across the country. Baez authored a book with [[Peter Golenbock]] about the Anthony Case, ''Presumed Guilty'', which was published on July 3, 2012 and became a [[New York Times Best Seller]]. [[Fox News Channel]] commentator [[Geraldo Rivera]] referred to Baez as "Juanie Cochran."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2011/06/02/geraldo-rivera-juanie-cochran-casey-anthony/ |title=Geraldo Rivera: Juanie Cochran &amp;#124; Fox News Latino |publisher=Latino.foxnews.com |date=2011-06-02 |accessdate=2013-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Missing in Aruba===

"'''Killing an Arab'''" is the first single by [[The Cure]]. It was recorded at the same time as their first [[LP record|LP]] in the UK, ''[[Three Imaginary Boys]]'' (1979), but not included on the album. However, it was included on the band's first US album, ''[[Boys Don't Cry (The Cure album)|Boys Don't Cry]]'' (1980).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=De Muir|first=Harold|title=An Interview With Robert Smith of The Cure|url=http://www.musicfanclubs.org/cure/press/I94.html|work=Eastcoast Rocket|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This song lends two of its lines to the titles of one of The Cure's compilation albums, ''[[Standing on a Beach]]'', and to its CD/video counterpart ''[[Staring at the Sea]]''.

==Lyrics and music==
Composer [[Robert Smith (musician)|Robert Smith]] has said that the song "was a short poetic attempt at condensing my impression of the key moments in ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|L'Étranger]]'' (''The Stranger'') by [[Albert Camus]]".&lt;ref&gt;''Cure News'' number 11, October 1991&lt;/ref&gt; The lyrics describe a shooting on a beach, in which the [[Arab]] of the title is killed by the song's narrator; in Camus' story the protagonist, Meursault, shoots an Arab on a beach, overwhelmed by his surroundings. Meursault is condemned for his honesty about his feelings. He is considered an outsider (or "stranger") because "he refuses to lie" and "doesn't play the game".&lt;ref&gt;Camus, Albert, ''The Outsider'', Penguin Classics, 1989, p. 118 (afterword by Albert Camus, 8 January 1955)&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon release, ''[[Melody Maker]]'' compared the song to "[[Hong Kong Garden (song)|Hong Kong Garden]]" by [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]]. Music critic Ian Birch wrote: "As 'Hong Kong Garden' used a simple Oriental-styled riff to striking effect, so '[Killing An] Arab' conjures up edginess through a Moorish-flavour guitar pattern".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first= Ian |last= Birch |magazine= [[Melody Maker]] |title= Practical Poprock |date= 24 March 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversial content==
The track has a controversial history, since it has often been viewed as promoting violence against Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Popular Arts in America: A History of Punk Rock |isbn=9780757571176|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, The Cure's first compilation of singles, ''[[Standing on a Beach]]'' (1986), was packaged with a sticker advising against racist usage of the song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/21/arts/rock-group-accedes-to-arab-protest.html | first=Jon | last=Pareles | date=21 January 1987 | accessdate=5 February 2013 | title=Rock Group Accedes to Arab Protest}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith and Elektra requested that radio stations discontinue airing the song and saw the sticker as a compromise to prevent having to pull the album from sale entirely. It saw controversy again during the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]] and following the [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.chartattack.com/news/2001/10/29/oh-god-not-again-robert-smith-on-killing-an-arab/ | first=Sean K. | last=Robb | publisher=''[[Chart (magazine)|Chart]]'' | date=29 October 2001 | accessdate=8 October 2009 | title='Oh God, not again': Robert Smith on Killing An Arab}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Killing an Arab" was the only single from the ''Three Imaginary Boys'' era not to be included on that album's [[Three Imaginary Boys#2004 Deluxe Edition|2004 remaster]] although it remains available on the albums ''[[Boys Don't Cry (The Cure album)|Boys Don't Cry]]'' and ''[[Standing on a Beach]]''.

The song was revived in 2005, when the band performed the song at several [[Europe]]an festivals. The lyrics, however, were changed from "Killing an Arab" to "Kissing an Arab". Smith added a whole new opening verse when the band performed it at the [[Royal Albert Hall]], [[London]] on 1 April 2006 as "Killing Another".  The "killing another" lyric was also used during the 2007-2008 [[4Tour]]. The band performed the song as "Killing an Ahab" with lyrics inspired by [[Herman Melville]] on 2011's "Reflections" tour.{{Citation needed|date= December 2012}}

==Live performance==
During live performances, the song is notably played with more energy making the song sound somewhat more anarchic and aggressive than originally recorded.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Covers==
"Killing an Arab" has been covered by [[Frodus]] on the 1995 Radiopaque compilation ''Give Me The Cure'',  and again in 2004 by DJ [[Riton (musician)|Riton]]. Also, the [[Electric Hellfire Club]] copied it on their 2000 [[Cleopatra Records]] compilation ''Empathy for the Devil''. [[Santigold]] covered the song at [[Lollapalooza]]. NYC band the Reign Released a cover of it as a single in 2014 on (F.R.O.G Records) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/killing-an-arab-single/id897386859 |title=Killing an Arab - Single by The Reign on Apple Music |website=Itunes.apple.com |date=2014-06-01 |accessdate=2016-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian band Turpentine also covered the song as a B-Side to their single "Filthy Little Pervert" in protest of the invasion of Iraq in 2003.

'''Ntomba''' and '''Lia''' ([[Guthrie classification of Bantu languages|Bolia]]) are closely related [[Bantu languages]] of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], close enough to be considered dialects of a single Lia-Ntomba language.

The related [[Mongo language]] also has varieties called ''Ntomba'' or ''Ntumba''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37963">This article provides incomplete lists of various Jewish populations worldwide. Some cities with large Jewish populations may be missing from the list due to a lack of census data or other reliable sources of information.

==Major Jewish population centers worldwide==
{{see also|Jewish population by country}}

===Jewish population by city===

Censuses in many countries do not record religious or ethnic background, leading to a lack of diversity on the exact numbers of Jewish population.{{Expand list|date=September 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2879">'''Lucille Gorham''' (January 18, 1931 - November 3, 2012) was a civil rights activist in [[Baltimore]] communities during the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. Born Lucille Alexander in [[Halifax, North Carolina]], Gorham moved to Baltimore in 1934 and resided a community in [[East Baltimore Midway, Baltimore|East Baltimore]]. She attended city public schools and later earned a [[General Educational Development|GED]], as well as studying at [[Sojourner–Douglass College|Sojourner Douglass College]]. Gorham lived a quiet life as a homemaker until 1967, when she became the president of Citizens for Fair Housing, a neighborhood association founded in response to the city's urban renewal plan. She soon led a successful community-owned and operated housing complex built on Madison Park Square between Caroline and Eden streets. She went on to become the director of the Madison Square Housing Association, director of the Middle East Community, and the leader of a neighborhood 4-H Club.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=She gave the Middle East neighborhood a name and a dream|last=Strausbaugh|first=John|date=August 15, 1982|work=The Baltimore Sun|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Baltimore riot of 1968]] resulting from the [[assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.]] propelled Gorham's role in neighborhood activism. In August 1968, Gorham began to operate "Our House," clubhouse that offered services to the community including home-cooked meals, a place for local children to spend their Saturday evenings, and a spot for senior citizens to meet with friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title="'Our house' is A home for many."|last=Keidel|first=Janelee|date=June 13, 1969|work=The Sun|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in life, Gorham fought against the expansion of the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] medical complex in 2002. As a result of the expansion, Gorham was forced out of her home in the [[Middle East, Baltimore|Middle East]] neighborhood of East Baltimore and moved to a home in the [[Belair-Edison, Baltimore|Belair-Edison]] neighborhood of Northeast Baltimore. Gorham died at 81 years old from a battle with [[cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/obituaries/bs-md-ob-lucille-gorham-20121107-story.html|title=Lucille Gorham, neighborhood activist|last=Sun|first=Jacques Kelly, The Baltimore|work=baltimoresun.com|access-date=2017-03-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Lum v. Rice''''', 275 U.S. 78 (1927), is a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court held that the [[Racial segregation in the United States|exclusion on account of race]] of a child of [[Chinese ancestry]] from a [[state high school]] did not violate the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. The decision effectively approved the exclusion of [[Minority group|minority]] children from schools reserved for whites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tolerance.org/magazine/number-25-spring-2004/feature/brown-v-board-timeline-school-integration-us&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In 1924, a nine-year-old [[Chinese-American]] named Martha Lum, daughter of Gong Lum, was prohibited from attending the [[Rosedale Consolidated High School]] of the [[Rosedale Consolidated School District]] in [[Bolivar County, Mississippi]] solely because she was of Chinese descent.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 10: ''Gong Lum et al. v. Rice et al.'' (1927). In: Tong, Benson (editor). ''Asian American Children: A Historical Handbook and Guide''. [[Greenwood Publishing Group]], 2004. {{ISBN|0313330425}}, 9780313330421. p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=uK6xhcu-4hAC&amp;pg=PA182 182].&lt;/ref&gt; There was no school in the district maintained for Chinese students, and she was forced by compulsory attendance laws to attend school.

A lower court granted the plaintiff's request of a [[writ of mandamus]] to force the members of the Board of Trustees to admit Martha Lum. Gong Lum's case was not that racial discrimination as such was illegal but that his daughter, being Chinese, had incorrectly been classified as ''[[colored]]'' by the authorities.

Since the ruling went against them, the Board of Trustees became the plaintiff, and Lum was named the defendant in the case ''Rice v. Gong Lum'', which was heard in the Supreme Court of Mississippi. The [[Mississippi Supreme Court]] reversed the lower court's decision and allowed the Board of Trustees to exclude Martha Lum from the school for white children. Gong Lum appealed the state Supreme Court's ruling to the US Supreme Court.

==The Supreme Court's decision==
In an opinion written by [[Chief Justice]] [[William Howard Taft]], the US Supreme Court affirmed the Mississippi supreme court's ruling and thus the position of the Board of Trustees. In the unanimous opinion, Taft held that the petitioner had not shown that there were no segregated schools accessible for the education of Martha Lum in Mississippi:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We must assume, then, that there are school districts for colored children in Bolivar county, but that no colored school is within the limits of the Rosedale consolidated high school district. This is not inconsistent with there being at a place outside of that district and in a different district, a colored school which the plaintiff Martha Lum may conveniently attend.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Taft further stated that given the accessibility of segregated schools, the question then was whether a person of Chinese ancestry, born in and a citizen of the United States, was denied equal protection of the law by being given the opportunity to attend a school that received "only children of the brown, yellow or black races." In reference to ''[[Cumming v. Richmond County Board of Education]]'', Taft concluded that the "right and power of the state to regulate the method of providing for the education of its youth at public expense is clear." Additionally, Taft pointed to a number of federal and state court decisions, most prominently ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'', all of which had upheld segregation in the public sphere and particularly in the realm of public education. Accordingly, Taft concluded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Most of the cases cited arose, it is true, over the establishment of separate schools as between white pupils and black pupils; but we cannot think that the question is any different, or that any different result can be reached, assuming the cases above cited to be rightly decided, where the issue is as between white pupils and the pupils of the yellow races. The decision is within the discretion of the state in regulating its public schools, and does not conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The judgement of the Mississippi Supreme Court was affirmed. Martha Lum was not allowed to go to the school for white children.

==Subsequent developments==
''Lum'' was effectively overruled by the Court's decision in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' (1954), which outlawed segregation in public schools. However, an important part of the decision still stands. The power of the state to make racial distinctions in its school system, and to determine the race of its students, has not been overturned because it was not an issue in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]''.&lt;ref&gt;347 U.S. 483&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rawles, Lee. (Host). (2017, May 17).''How a Chinese American Family Challenged School Segregation in 1920's Mississippi.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8603">'''Mapuche medicine''' is the system of medical treatment historically used by the [[Mapuche people]] of southern Chile. It is essentially magical-religious in nature, believing disease to be caused by supernatural factors such as spells and curable by treatments based on rituals, thermal waters and herbs. Knowledge of medicinal herbs is one of the best-known elements of Mapuche medicine and is still used today.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livingatlaschile.com/ Mapuche herbal medicine] {English} subtitles, Living Atlas Chile, retrieved December 07, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Algunos&gt;{Spanish} Zúñiga S. Algunos aspectos de las costumbres y reseña del cuidado del niño entre los antiguos araucanos. Ars Médica. Revista de Estudios Médicos Humanísticos 2001; 141-150, retrieved December 5, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
One of the most striking aspects of historical Mapuche medicine was the use of [[surgery]] as a treatment, which was developed to treat wounds and traumas suffered in the frequent battles between tribes. Fractures and dislocations of bones were treated by immobilising and covering the limbs with pastes and ointments made of medicinal herbs.&lt;ref name="Cruz-Coke"&gt;Cruz-Coke, Ricardo. Historia de la medicina chilena.  Primera edición. Santiago de Chile: Andrés Bello, 1995, retrieved December 05, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
As in Europe, the practice of the [[bloodletting]] was also commonplace and used as a treatment for many conditions. In Mapuche culture, it was done by making small cuts with a very sharp stone called a "guincubue" to draw blood, then covering the cut with an astringent or herbal mix. Bloodletting was also used by parents on children to make them lighter, more agile and more capable of working and fighting, as it was thought that their blood was salty and heavy.&lt;ref name="Cruz-Coke"/&gt;
Hygiene was very important in Mapuche life. They were very clean and tidy, bathing every day in nearby streams or rivers, regardless of weather conditions. The bark of the [[Quillaja saponaria|Quillaja tree]], which is very common in the local area, was used as soap (and is still used today in some commercial beauty products).&lt;ref name=Algunos/&gt;

==Historical context==
The Mapuche people came about as the result of the mingling of two cultures: the [[Moluche people]], from what today is [[Pampas|Argentina’s Pampa]], with the indigenous inhabitants of the region between the [[Toltén River|Toltén]] and [[Bío Bío River|Bío Bío]] rivers in [[Chile]].
The Mapuche had no written language and their knowledge was transmitted orally. Most of their traditions and culture, including their medical knowledge, were documented for the first time by the European [[conquistador]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Latcham, E. Ricardo. La organización social y creencias religiosas de los antiguos araucanos. Publicaciones del Museo de Etnología y Antropología de Chile. Tomo III. Imprenta Cervantes, Santiago, 1924&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[File:Mapuche Machis.jpg|thumb|Mapuche Machis (1903)]]

==Different kind of healers==
There were three main categories of doctors or healers in Mapuche medicine: the vileus, the ampiver and the machis.&lt;ref name="Cruz-Coke"/&gt;
 
* Vileus:
:These were methodical doctors who believed that disease was caused by insects and worms. They worked to cure epidemic disease among the Mapuche which mainly arose after the arrival of the Spanish.
* Ampiver: 
:These were empirical doctors with procedures based on observation, who used simple remedies and techniques. They knew how to take the blood pressure and make basic diagnoses. Their treatments were based mainly on the use of medicinal herbs.
* Lawentuchefe: 
:They have great kwnoledge of healing through herbs and plants. They use this knowledge to help restore health when people suffer from different illnesses. The Lawentuchefe are not shamans and sometimes are confused with the Machi, but the Lawentuchefe do not have mystical knowledge. Their function is limited to herbalism and its applications to heal sickness. The state of the native forests have put the Lawentuchefes in a hard place because of the loss of the medical flora (lawen). This is also producing the loss of the Lawentuchefes in the communities.
* [[Machi (shaman)|Machi]]:
:The machi (Mapuche shaman) was a combination of a priest and a healer. Mapuche people visited the machi only after other healers had been unable to cure their condition. They had rudimentary knowledge of human anatomy and, though unable to form a diagnosis based on disparate symptoms such as vomiting, fever or cramps, they were able to treat some monosymptomatic diseases like scabies, sciatica or gout with good results. They had a deep understanding of the benefits of [[hot spring]]s and advised patients on which water source to help their illness. They successfully carried out minor surgery on fractures and small tumours and also had knowledge of medicinal plants, knowing specifically which plant, and which specific part of that plant, should be used to take best advantage of their medicinal qualities.

If a patient did not recover from any of these methods, the last resort was the performance of a magic ritual called "Machitún".  Machis also served as advisors and oracles for their community.

[[File:Machitún Mapuche.jpg|thumb|Machitún Mapuche by [[Claude Gay]]]]

; Machitún
If a machi had tried all conventional treatments without success a machitún ceremony would be tried, where the machi communicates with the spiritual world in order to find a diagnosis and a cure.
For the machitún, the machi places a bunch of [[Lauraceae|laurel]] leaves with some [[Drimys winteri|canelo tree]] leaves in the centre in the corner of a small hut called a ruka [es:ruca |(ruca)], and prepares a goat for sacrifice there. Women sang mournful songs while the machi spread tobacco smoke through the room and got ready to sacrifice the animal.
The goat’s heart was cut out and placed it in the canelo leaves, and then the machi simulated penetrating the patient’s abdomen in a search of the "magic poison".  Finally, the machi played the [[cultrún]] and fell in a trance where the spirits would tell him how to treat the patient.&lt;ref name="Cruz-Coke"/&gt;
On occasion, the three kinds of doctors would meet to solve a problem in a meeting called a "Thauman".&lt;ref name="Cruz-Coke"/&gt;
Apart from the three kinds of doctors previously mentioned, there were two further kinds of surgeons. The cupove was a pathologist who would examine corpses to determine the disease and cause of death and the gutave was a surgeon expert at treating wounds, ulcers and many kinds of wounds.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

==Mapuche medicine today==
There are several government programs today which aim to integrate traditional mapuche medicine with Western medicine. They look to incorporate the cultural aspects of Mapuche medicine into modern Western techniques and in this way facilitate bringing modern techniques into Mapuche communities. Examples include the "Programa de Salud Mapuche" (Mapuche Health Program) and the "Mesa Local (PROMAP)" (PROMAP Local Board). The latter aims specifically to incorporate Mapuche views on health and environmental issues into its work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webhosting.redsalud.gov.cl/transparencia/public/AO057/ciudadana.html Ministerio de salud de Chile] redsalud.gov.cl , retrieved December 07, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Mauritian of French origin''', as the name implies, is a [[Mauritians|Mauritian]] person whose ancestors are from [[France]]. A member of such group is usually identified as a '''Franco-Mauritian'''.

==Origins==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}
The first French settlers arrived in Mauritius (then [[Isle de France (Mauritius)|Isle de France]]) in 1722, after the previous attempts of settlement by the Dutch had failed, and the island had once again become abandoned. They lived and prospered on the island, ruling it until the British invasion of 1810. The French by now strongly identified with the island, and the terms of capitulation allowed the settlers to live on as a distinct francophone ethnic group for the next 158 years under British rule before Mauritius attained independence.  By 1920 the French Mauritian population on the island was between 70,000 to 80,000 out of 375,000 inhabitants representing around 20% of the total population.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1920/01/11/102736835.pdf |title=Sentimental Domain: Island of Mauritius, Scene of "Paul et Virginie," Seeks Return to French Control |date=11 January 1920 |website=New York Times |access-date=2018-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all Franco-Mauritians have pure French lineage, many also have British or other European ancestors that came to Mauritius and were absorbed in the Franco-Mauritian community or the ''gens de couleur'' (Coloureds). There are an estimated 15,000&amp;ndash;20,000 Franco-Mauritians; French lineage is also found within the gens de couleur community with many having predominantly French ancestors&amp;mdash;a further 30,000 people with considerable French bloodline. Within the Afro-Creole community, a large amount of people have some French ancestors from slavery.

==Demographic factors==
Franco-Mauritians comprise 2% of the population of Mauritius and own many of the largest businesses in the country.&lt;ref name="eco" &gt;{{cite news|title=The legacy of Indian migration to European colonies|url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21727896-century-after-india-ended-system-indentured-labour-its-diaspora-building|accessdate=2 September 2017|work=[[The Economist]]|date=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Franco-Mauritians are Roman Catholic.

'''Molbog''' is an [[Austronesian language]] spoken in the [[Philippines]] and [[Sabah]], [[Malaysia]]. Majority of speakers are concentrated at the southernmost tip of the Philippine province of [[Palawan]], specifically the municipalities of [[Bataraza]] and [[Balabac, Palawan|Balabac]]. Both municipalities are considered as bastions for environmental conservation in the province. The majority of Molbog speakers are Muslims.

The classification of Molbog is controversial.&lt;ref name="Blust2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Blust |first=Robert |date=2010 |title=The Greater North Borneo Hypothesis |journal=Oceanic Linguistics |volume=49 |issue=1 |pages=44-118 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/40783586}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thiessen (1981) groups Molbog with the [[Palawan languages]], based on shared phonological and lexical innovations.&lt;ref&gt;Thiessen, Henry Arnold  (1981).  ''Phonological reconstruction of Proto Palawan.'' Anthropological Papers, no. 10. Manila: National Museum of the Philippines.&lt;/ref&gt; This classification is supported by Smith (2017).&lt;ref&gt; Smith, Alexander (2017). ''The Languages of Borneo: A Comprehensive Classification''. PhD Dissertation: University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa.&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative view is taken by Lobel (2013), who puts Molbog together with [[Bonggi language|Bonggi]] in a [[Molbog-Bonggi languages|Molbog-Bonggi]] subgroup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lobel |first=Jason William |date=2013 |title=Southwest Sabah Revisited |journal=Oceanic Linguistics |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=36-68 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/43286760}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Phone-paid Services Authority''' ('''PSA'''), known as '''PhonepayPlus''' until 1 November 2016,&lt;ref name="ppp_rename"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phonepayplus.org.uk/news-and-events/news/2016/july/uk-regulator-phonepayplus-to-rename-as-phone-paid-services-authority |title=UK regulator PhonepayPlus to rename as Phone-paid Services Authority |author= |work=PhonepayPlus |date=12 July 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025141559/http://www.phonepayplus.org.uk/news-and-events/news/2016/july/uk-regulator-phonepayplus-to-rename-as-phone-paid-services-authority |archivedate=2016-10-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[regulatory body]] for all [[Premium-rate telephone number|premium rate phone-paid services]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. These are the content, goods and services that consumers can buy by charging the cost to their phone bills and pre-pay phone accounts.&lt;ref name="dg_067032"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Dl1/Directories/DG_067032 |title=PhonepayPlus (formerly ICSTIS) |work= |publisher=Directgov |date=2 January 2012 |deadurl=no |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121015000000/http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Dl1/Directories/DG_067032 |archive-date=2012-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was founded as the '''Independent Committee for the supervision of Standards of Telephone Information Services'''&lt;ref name="icstis_about"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icstis.org.uk/about/default.asp |title=ICSTIS - About |author= |work=ICSTIS |publisher= |date=12 August 2007 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812142726/http://www.icstis.org.uk/about/default.asp |archivedate=2007-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ('''ICSTIS''') at the request of three network operators ([[British Telecom]], [[Mercury Communications]], and [[Vodafone]]) as a response to public criticism of their profiting from adult premium rate content. It re-branded itself as '''PhonepayPlus''' in June 2007.&lt;ref name="TheRegister_20070619"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/06/19/icstis_rebrand_phonepayplus/ |title=Goodbye ICSTIS, hello PhonePayPlus |date=19 June 2007 |first=Christopher |last=Williams |access-date=2017-01-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It regulates services using a Code of Practice,&lt;ref name="psa_cop"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://psauthority.org.uk/for-business/code-of-practice |title=Code of Practice |author= |work=Phone-paid Services Authority |publisher= |date= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161211161014/http://psauthority.org.uk/for-business/code-of-practice |archivedate=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; approved by [[Ofcom]]. This sets out the rules with which all providers of phone-paid services must comply. Among other things, it requires clear and accurate pricing information, honest advertising and service content, and appropriate and targeted promotions. The code is updated approximately annually.

The Phone-paid Services Authority investigates complaints about phone-paid services. Where it decides that its rules have been broken, it can fine the company responsible, bar access to its services, and even bar the individual behind the company from running other services under a different company name. Investigations and adjudications are free to consumers and are supposed to be fully independent.  
The Phone-paid Services Authority regulates services using the following number ranges: 070, 087, 090, 091, 098 and 118, plus five-digit mobile shortcodes.&lt;ref name="psa_ranges"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://psauthority.org.uk/-/media/Files/PSA/For-Businesses/Your-phone-paid-service/Code-of-Practice/Number-Ranges-Regulated-fact-sheet.ashx?la=en |title=Number ranges regulated by the Phone-paid Services Authority |author= |work=Phone-paid Services Authority |publisher= |date= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161125160334/http://psauthority.org.uk/-/media/Files/PSA/For-Businesses/Your-phone-paid-service/Code-of-Practice/Number-Ranges-Regulated-fact-sheet.ashx?la=en |archivedate=2016-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phone-paid Services Authority powers==
When the Phone-paid Services Authority upholds a breach of its Code, the company responsible must immediately amend the service and/or its promotional material so that it complies with the Code. In most cases, companies found in breach of the Code will be charged to cover the cost of the investigation.

The Phone-paid Services Authority also has the power to impose the following sanctions: 
# formal reprimands
# making companies come to the regulator for prior approval
# ordering companies to pay full refunds to complainants
# imposing fines
# barring access to services
# banning named persons from operating services

==Phone-paid Services Authority board==
Chairs of the board have included:
*Sir [[Louis Blom-Cooper]] QC, Lawyer
*[[Brenda Dean, Baroness Dean of Thornton-le-Fylde]], Trade Unionist
*Sir [[Peter North (academic)]]
*Sir [[Alistair Graham]], Fmr Chair of the Committee on standards in public life

The '''''Pipiltzin''''' (sg. pilli) were the [[nobility|noble]] [[social class]] in the [[Mexica Empire]]. They are below the ruling nobles in the civilization's social structure and above the commoners who achieved noble status due to an outstanding deed in war. These people were members of the hereditary nobility and occupied positions in the [[government]] as ambassadors and ministers, the army and the [[priesthood]]. The subclasses within the ''Pipiltzin'' were: tlahtohcapilli (a tlahtoani's son), tecpilli or teucpilli (a teucli's son), tlazohpilli (son of legitimate wife), and calpanpilli (son of a concubine).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Aztec Warfare: Imperial Expansion and Political Control|last=Hassig|first=Ross|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|year=1995|isbn=0806121211|location=Norman|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children of the ''Pipiltzin'' were given extensive education in preparation for the role they will play in their adult life. They were sent to the ''calmecac'', which was the center for higher learning, to study the ancient wisdom as well as "elegant forms of speech, ancient hymns, poems and historical accounts, religious doctrines, the calendar, astronomy, astrology, legal precepts and the art of the government."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge History of Latin America|last=Bethell|first=Leslie|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1984|isbn=0521232236|location=Cambridge|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The  ''Pipiltzin,'' however, helped increase social stresses which attributed to internal weaknesses that led to the [[Aztec]] Empire's downfall.

== Origin ==
As the [[Aztecs]] began settling what would later become their homelands, an elite emerged (the ''Pipiltzin'') that claimed descent from the [[Toltecs]], the former empire of Central [[Mexico]]. The new hereditary elite unified the clans that had been the center of [[Aztec]] life and paved the way for a conquest empire. Some sources describe the ''Pipiltzin'' as the offspring of ''tlahtohqueh'' and ''teteuctin'', which were different social classes within the ruling nobility.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

The name was also where the [[Pipil people]] of western El Salvador get their name, as they are descendants of Toltec people who migrated and settle in El Salvador.

The authority and prestige of the ''Pipiltzin'' were based on the belief that they descended from the original migrant founders of the Aztecs and came from a mythical place.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mexico: A Brief History|last=Chavez|first=Alicia|publisher=University of California Press|year=2006|isbn=0520233212|location=Berkeley|pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this heritage, they enjoyed privileges such as special family dispensation, the use of privilege goods and dwellings that were appropriate to their station.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Russians in Korea''' do not form a very large population, but they have a history going back to the [[Korean Empire]]. The community of Russian subjects/citizens in [[Korea]] has historically included not just [[Russians|ethnic Russians]], but members of [[ethnic groups of Russia|minority groups of Russia]] as well, such as [[Tatars]], [[Polish minority in Russia|Poles]], and, more recently, return migrants from among the ''[[Koryo-saram]]'' ([[Korean diaspora|ethnic Koreans]] whose ancestors migrated to the [[Russian Far East]] in the late 19th century) and [[Sakhalin Koreans]].&lt;ref name="Joongang"&gt;{{citation|date=2004-11-08|accessdate=2007-05-28|title=A taste of Russia in heart of Seoul|periodical=JoongAng Daily|url=http://english.seoul.go.kr/today/news/newsclip/1213490_3675.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612170444/http://english.seoul.go.kr/today/news/newsclip/1213490_3675.html|archivedate=2008-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Migration history==

===Early history===
[[File:Former Russia legation of Korea 02.JPG|thumb|left|The old Russian legation building in Seoul]]
The earliest Russian subject in Korea is believed to have been [[Afanasy Ivanovich Seredin-Sabatin]] (Афанасий Иванович Середин-Сабатин), an architect from a family [[Swiss emigration to Russia|of Swiss origin]]; he was invited to Korea from [[Tianjin]], [[China]] in 1884 by [[Gojong of the Korean Empire|King Gojong]]. [[Karl Ivanovich Weber]] became the Russian Empire's official representative in Seoul in April 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Volkov|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the establishment of formal relations, more Russians began migrating into Korea throughout the 1890s, largely via [[Manchuria]]. At that time, the community was centred on the Russian legation, opened in 1890, and the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] of [[Saint Nicholas]], opened in 1903, both located in Seoul's Jeongdong (located in present-day [[Jung-gu, Seoul|Jung-gu]]). The Russian community in these days was composed largely of missionaries, diplomats, and businessmen; Russia played an important role in the Korean politics of the era, and at one point, Gojong actually [[Korea royal refuge at the Russian legation|lived in the Russian compound]], in fear of his life after the 1895 assassination of his wife [[Empress Myeongseong|Queen Min]]. However, with Russia's defeat in the 1905 [[Russo-Japanese War]], Russian influence in Korea began to wane.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Clark|1994|pp=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1922 influx of Russian refugees from the [[History of Vladivostok#After the Revolution|fall of Vladivostok]] to the [[Red Army]] would completely change the face of the community.&lt;ref name="Lankov"&gt;{{citation|url=http://news.empas.com/show.tsp/cp_kt/20031008n02977/?kw=advert%20%3Cb%3E%26%3C%2Fb%3E|title=The Dawn of Modern Korea: Russian Immigrants|last=Lankov|first=Andrei|date=2003-10-08|accessdate=2007-05-25|periodical=Empas News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October of that year, more than 15,000 refugees landed at [[Wonsan]], [[Kangwon-do (North Korea)|Kangwon-do]]. Roughly half were quickly able to obtain onward passage to [[Shanghai]], but the refugees who had not taken valuables with them when fleeing Vladivostok were stuck in Wonsan for the winter; they relied on charitable donations and day labour for their survival. According to [[William Arthur Noble]], an [[United States|American]] [[missionary]] in Korea, no more than 20% were literate; they lived either on overcrowded ships, or in barely heated customs warehouses at the docks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Clark|1994|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring of 1923, the refugees began to disperse, moving on to [[Harbin]], where there was a [[Harbin Russians|significant community of Russians]], or even to overseas destinations in [[Latin America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Clark|1994|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1925, [[Japanese–Soviet relations|Japan finally recognised the Soviet Union]], and handed over the old Russian Legation building to the new Soviet ambassador. By the late 1920s, there were only around a hundred Russians living in Seoul; former nobles and officials lived in Jeongdong, while a community of Tatars lived and worked in the markets near [[Namdaemun]] and Honmachi (modern-day [[Myeongdong]]). However, due to [[Classism|class divisions]] within the community, the two groups had little interaction with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Clark|1994|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Yankovsky]], the grandson of a Polish noble exiled to [[Siberia]], also maintained a resort in [[Chongjin]] which was popular among the Russian communities of East Asia, but virtually unknown to other westerners; when the [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|Soviets invaded North Korea]], most of the Russians still living there were arrested and forcibly repatriated to the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Clark|1994|pp=48–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After independence from the Japanese Empire===
New Russian communities have formed in various cities in [[South Korea]]. In [[Seoul]], a "Little Russia" began to form in [[Jung-gu, Seoul|Jung-gu]]'s Gwanghui-dong, near [[Dongdaemun]], in the late 1980s. Roughly 50,000 people from [[post-Soviet states]] were estimated to live in the area in 2004, down from 70,000 several years previously due to deportations of [[illegal immigration|illegal immigrants]].&lt;ref name="Joongang"/&gt; In [[Busan]], Russians are concentrated in the former "Texas Town" in [[Jung-gu, Busan|Jung-gu]]'s Jungang-dong; roughly 200 are estimated to live in the city permanently, with several hundred more on short-term visas, along with a large transient population of Russian sailors.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/1999/12/01/pusan.2.t.php#|title=In Korea, 'Texas Town' Goes  Russian|last=Kirk|first=Don|date=1999-12-01|accessdate=2007-05-28|periodical=International Herald Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
[[File:Seoul St.Nicholas Cathedral.jpg|thumb|[[St. Nicholas Cathedral (Seoul)|St. Nicholas Cathedral]] in [[Seoul]], Korea]]

After the [[Korean War]] (1950-1953), South Koreans were unfavorably disposed towards Russia because of its alliance with North Korea. Korean Orthodox believers did not want to have any relations with the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. As a result, the Orthodox Community of South Korea found itself cut off from the rest of the Orthodox Church; that is the community did not belonging to any ecclesiastical jurisdiction.

This very serious ecclesiological problem was resolved as follows; On 25 December 1955, after the Christmas Divine Liturgy, the General Assembly of the Orthodox Community of South Korea unanimously decided to request to come under the jurisdiction of the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]]. The Ecumenical Patriarchate accepted the request and, since then, the [[Korean Orthodox Church]] has remained a metropolis of the See of Constantinople.

After the collapse of the communist regime in Russia and the Balkans in the 1990s, the first economic immigrants from Orthodox countries began to arrive in South Korea. Many of them, being strangers among strangers, were interested in finding an Orthodox church. From the beginning, they found refuge and support in the arms of the Korean Orthodox Church. The then Metropolitan [[Sotirios Trambas]] of Korea embraced them all with his love and paternal affection and slowly created the first nucleus of Slavic-speaking Orthodox faithful. He himself learned how to celebrate the Divine Liturgy in Slavonic and since 1992 in [[Seoul]] (in the chapel of the Dormition) or at the Monastery of the Transfiguration in Kapeong, where the pilgrims spent many weekend, he celebrated the Divine Liturgy for them. He also held special services for Slavic-speakers on Christmas Day and other Feast days with the old Calendar in order to give them a sense of familiarity and belonging. In 1995, during his historic first official visit to Korea, the [[Ecumenical Patriarch]] [[Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople|Bartholomew]] laid the foundation stone of the chapel of Saint Maximus the Greek.

Since then the Orthodox Metropolis of Korea has undertaken the responsibility and pastoral care of all the Orthodox residing in the country as well as those who are temporary visitors and workers, such as sailors and entrepreneurs. In other words, all Orthodox believers of various nationalities (Koreans, Russians, Greeks, etc.) are “under the omophoron,” or spiritual jurisdiction and care, of the Ecumenical Patriarch. In order to provide proper pastoral care to all Orthodox in Korea, apart from the Cathedral of St. Nicholas in Seoul, there is also the Chapel of St. Maximus the Greek, in which the Services and the Divine Liturgy are celebrated in Slavonic for Slavic-speakers, and occasionally in English for English speakers. Also, in the church of the Annunciation in the [[Busan]], the chapel of Saint George is used for the celebration of the Divine Liturgy in Slavonic for Slavic-speakers who reside in and near Busan.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.orthodoxkorea.org/history/|last=Zographos|first=Metropolitan Ambrosios-Aristotle|publisher=Korean Orthodox Church|date=2005-05-01|accessdate=2007-05-28|title=CHRONICLE OF THE CREATION OF ORTHODOX DIASPORA IN KOREA AND THE PASTORAL CARE OFFERED BY THE HOLY METROPOLIS OF KOREA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russians in [[Pyongyang]] have sometimes been served by Orthodox clergy sent from [[Vladivostok]] since 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Russian Orthodox Christians celebrate Pentecost in Pyongyang|date=2007-05-26|accessdate=2007-05-28|url=http://www.asianews.it/index.php?l=en&amp;art=9377&amp;size=A|periodical=AsiaNews.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Church of the Life-Giving Trinity (Pyongyang)|Church of the Life-Giving Trinity]] in Pyongyang was dedicated in 2006. It was built at the order of [[Kim Jong-il]] after his visit to the church of [[Innocent of Irkutsk]] in [[Khabarovsk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|periodical=NewsRu.com|title=Русский священник в Пхеньяне радуется за северокорейцев - жить сложно, но они истинные патриоты|date=2010-08-24|accessdate=2010-09-06|url=http://www.newsru.com/religy/24aug2010/kndr.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Shalmani''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0RQwcO0wM6IC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=shalmani |title=Pakistan |author=Pete Heiden |page=75 |year=2012 |publisher=[[ABDO Publishing Company]]|isbn=9781617876318 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Shilmani'' ({{lang-ps|شلمانى}}) is a [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] tribe who is primarily concentrated in the [[Shalman Valley]] in [[Khyber Agency]] near [[Peshawar]], [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]], [[Pakistan]]. ''Shalmani'' is also known as ''Sulemani'' ({{lang-ps|سليمانى}}) in [[Abbottabad]], [[Mansehra]] and [[Haripur, Pakistan|Haripur]]. The tribe is present in different parts of Pakistan. In Pakistan, the tribe lives in [[Swat (Pakistan)|Swat]], [[Upper Dir]], [[Lower Dir]], [[Bajour]], [[Buner District|Buner]], [[Shangla District|Shangla]], [[Malakand District]], [[Dargai]], Sakha Koat,Shodag, [[Charsadda District, Pakistan|Charsadda]]  ([[Hashtnagar]]).

According to Khan Roshan Khan, in his book about Pashtun's history "Tazkira" at page-379/380 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Tazkira: Pathano Ki Asliyat Aur Inki Tarikh |url=https://archive.org/stream/TazkirapathanoKiAsliyatAurInKiTarikh/1491_tazkiraAHistoryOfPathans#page/n0/mode/2up/details|author=Khan Roshan Khan |publisher= Al Makhzan Printers |year=1992|}} &lt;/ref&gt; ,"Shalmanis(Shilmanis) are "Banu Bakhtar"(بنو بختر) who were living in an area "Shalman" in Syria.These Banu Bakhtar were the land lords of areas like Shalman(شلمان), Ainab(عيناب) and Baiswad(بيسود) in Syria. 

Similar to Shalman of Khyber, a city by name [[Shalman]] is also present in [[Gilan Province]] of [[Iran]], and the fourth largest river in Iran is also named as Shalman. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Trip to Persia: Iran Seas, Lakes and Lagoons |url=https://triptopersia.com/about-iran/iran-seas-lakes-and-lagoons}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These landmarks with synonym Shalman suggest that this tribe could have moved from Syria through Iran (Gilan Shalman) to current [[Shalman Valley]] in [[Khyber Agency]] near [[Peshawar]], [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]], [[Pakistan]].

==History==

[[Khan Roshan Khan]] a Pakhtun historian says that Shalmani were originally brought to [[Swat District]] by one of the famous conquerors and kings, [[Muhammad of Ghor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Yūsufzaʻī Qaum kī Sarguzasht:K̲h̲ashshī Qabāʻil aur G̲h̲auriyāk̲h̲īl...kī ḥairat angaez, mufassil aur tahqīqī sarguzasht |author=[[Khan Roshan Khan]] |language=Urdu |oclc=81889189}}"&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Shalman Valley]] of khyber Agency in present [[Pakistan]] and Karman of today's [[Afghanistan]]. 

M.Saida Khan Shinwari states in his book that, Shilmani are [[Ghoryakhel]] tribe divided as Shamsher Khel, Halimzai and Kam Shilmanis and considers them to be [[Mohmand]]. He states that Shamsher Khels are related to Morcha Khel Mohmands, Halimzai to Halimzai Mohmands and Kam Shilmanis to Tarakzai Mohmands. Officially the Shilmanis are treated as a separate tribe since the Khyber Agreement of 1881. The Shilmanis are closer to Mohmands in characteristics and based on historical evidence they appear to be close kinsmen of the Mohmand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Khyber: A Historical Sketch |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9FtHAAAAIAAJ |author=M. Saida Khan |publisher=A.R. Yusuñ |year=1926 |oclc=5705079}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shalmani are called as "Shalmani Momands" by Harold Carmichael Wylly, at page-317 in his book "From the Black Mountain to Waziristan". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=From the Black Mountain to Waziristan |url=https://books.google.com.sa/books?id=69y1AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=shilmani&amp;dq=shilmani&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiXntCa1a3YAhXDzRQKHbJVBd8Q6AEISTAH |author=Harold Carmichael Wylly |}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hashtnagar State of Shalmanis==
Suleman Shahid suggests In his book, that Shilmani were the strongest tribe among other Pashtun  tribes. Primarily they were under [[Swat District]] state and Swati King by name Sultan Pakal, but later on Mir Hinda, who was a combatant leader, occupied [[Hashtnagar]] and announced it as "Hashtnagar State of Shalmanis".&lt;ref name=sulemanshahid&gt;{{cite book |title=Gumnām riyāsat : Dīr ke lākhon̲ maz̤lūmon̲ ke nām |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZjSQPgAACAAJ |page=73 |author=Sulaimān Shāhid |publisher=Muḥammad Raḥmán Buk Ḍipo |year=2005 |oclc=62110093}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is assumed by some local historians that, after centuries when [[Yusufzai]] exiled by [[Mughal Empire]] from Afghanistan, So Yusufzai tribe attacked on Shilmani tribe and took Charsada [[Hashtnagar]] from them with support of [[Dilazak]] and other allied tribes of [[Yusufzai]] and later gave to [[Muhammadzai (Charsadda)]] son of [[Zamand tribe]]. Muhammadzai  were Yusufzai allies in the battle of Bajawar against the [[Ghoryakhel]] tribe and Shalmanis are sub-tribe of [[Momand]] Ghoryakhel, therefore Muhammadzai were awarded with Hashtnagar by Yusufzai after the conquest of Bajawar .  Shalmani were very strong and it was unable to defeat them, in the [[Hashtnagar]] battle and it was ended after two years.

However this local story seems to be invalid as the ancient Skha Koat landlords are still living since centuries there and this is the evidence of no foreign invasion over Shalmani tribe in Hashtnagar. If so, then in addition to Skha Koat the Shilmani of Mandani (Charsaddah), Naguman (charsaddah) and Turlandai (Nowshera) would not exist today in there villages and lands. 

When Pakistan had not yet come into being, Bacha Khan Shalmani of Sakha Kot Malakand Agency, was the prominent figure of the Shalmani tribe and was a politician. Mr. Naek Amal Khan Shalmani and Rahat Khan Shalmani belong to the family of Bacha Khan.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6313">In 1730 [[Thomas Coram]] approached aristocratic women to support the establishment of a [[Foundling Hospital]], which he would present to [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/53361054|title=Thomas Coram, Gent., 1668-1751|last=Gillian.|first=Wagner,|date=2004|publisher=The Boydell Press|isbn=1843830574|location=Woodbridge, Suffolk|oclc=53361054}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/6707267|title=Coram's children : the London Foundling Hospital in the eighteenth century|last=1916-|first=McClure, Ruth K.,|date=1981|publisher=Yale University Press|year=|isbn=0300024657|location=New Haven|pages=276n30|oclc=6707267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The women who signed were of aristocratic backgrounds, and Coram kept a list in his pocket memorandum book, captioned 'An Exact Account when each Lady of Charity Signed their Declaration'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In several cases, he had already approached the women's husbands several years earlier, and been turned away. Their involvement is widely regarded as the gateway to wider support of his philanthropic cause. In an essay in the catalogue of an exhibition celebrating women's roles in the Foundling Hospital, Elizabeth Einberg states that &lt;blockquote&gt;Coram could see that securing the approval of a group of right-thinking women, of wives and dowagers at the pinnacle of society would highlight the Christian, virtuous and humanitarian aspects of such an endeavour and make it socially acceptable. In the events, it became not only that, but one of the most fashionable charities of the day.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Einberg, 'Elegant Revolutionaries', article in Ladies of Quality and Distinction Catalogue, Foundling Hospital, London 2018, pp. 14-15, p.15. https://foundlingmuseum.org.uk/events/ladies-of-quality-distinction/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;These female signatories are listed here in chronological order of date of their signature:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2678">In the [[United States]], a '''split estate''' is an estate where the property rights to the surface and the underground are split between two parties.  It is the result of [[Homestead Act]]s such as the [[Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act]] (1971) or the [[Stock-Raising Homestead Act]] (1916).&lt;ref&gt;Idaho Department of Land website's [http://www.idl.idaho.gov/bureau/minerals/min_leasing/leasing.htm#whatis FAQs]&lt;/ref&gt; A split estate is similar to the [[Broad form deed|Broad Form Deed]], a type of legal document created in the United States in the early 1900s. These documents were used to sever property into mineral and surface rights, just like a split estate today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Night Comes to the Cumberlands: a biography of a depressed area|last=Caudill|first=Harry M.|publisher=Jesse Stuart Foundation|year=2001|isbn=1931672008 |OCLC=47797627|location=Ashland, KY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In the 49 United States practicing British [[common law]] (the 50th, [[Louisiana]], derived its law from French and [[Napoleonic Code]]), a split estate is created when the original [[fee simple]] owner sells or otherwise loses ownership of the subsurface, often called the [[mineral estate]].  Executor rights transfer in whole, unless otherwise reserved, and administration of the estate carries the same rights, liabilities, and privileges the surface estate does.{{which|date=August 2016}}

In the Louisiana, severability of estate is legal and common, however a particular law practice similar to [[easements in English law]] allows the reversion of the mineral estate to the current surface owner if the mineral estate is not actively engaged in productive activity. This is similar to [[squatter's rights]] in other states; however other states do not allow this for the mineral property.

Who owns the right to exploit the underground is important in case it contains [[mineral]]s, [[Petroleum|oil]], or [[natural gas]].&lt;ref&gt;Federal government's [http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en/prog/energy/oil_and_gas/best_management_practices/split_estate.html FAQs]&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently the object of controversies&lt;ref&gt;Forbes' [https://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2011/03/08/business-wy-wind-power_8344287.html Wyoming lawmakers fail to settle eminent domain issue]&lt;/ref&gt; because some landowners are concerned about the nuisance and environmental impact.&lt;ref&gt;NPR's [http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2011/03/07/pm-homeowners-try-to-protect-properties-from-oil-boom/ Homeowners try to protect their properties from oil boom]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Stanford v. Kentucky''''', 492 U.S. 361 (1989),&lt;ref name=Opinion&gt;{{ussc|name=Stanford v. Kentucky|492|361|1989}}. {{usgovpd}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[United States]] [[SCOTUS|Supreme Court]] case that sanctioned the imposition of the death penalty on offenders who were at least 16 years of age at the time of the crime.  This decision came one year after ''[[Thompson v. Oklahoma]]'', in which the Court had held that a 15-year-old offender could not be executed because to do so would constitute cruel and unusual punishment.  In 2003, the [[Governor of Kentucky]] [[Paul E. Patton]] commuted the death sentence of Kevin Stanford, an action followed by the Supreme Court two years later in ''[[Roper v. Simmons]]'' overruling ''Stanford'' and holding that all juvenile offenders are exempt from the death penalty.

==Background==
The case involved the shooting death of 20-year-old Barbel Poore in [[Jefferson County, Kentucky]]. Kevin Stanford committed the murder on January 7, 1981, when he was approximately 17 years and 4 months of age. Stanford and his accomplice repeatedly raped and sodomized Poore during and after their commission of a robbery at a gas station where she worked as an attendant. They then drove her to a secluded area near the station, where Stanford shot her pointblank in the face and then in the back of her head. The proceeds from the robbery were roughly 300 cartons of cigarettes, two gallons of fuel, and a small amount of cash.

After Stanford's arrest, a Kentucky juvenile court conducted hearings to determine whether he should be transferred for [[trial as an adult]], and, stressing the seriousness of his offenses and his long history of past delinquency, found that certification for trial as an adult to be in the best interest of Stanford and the community.

Stanford was convicted of murder, first-degree sodomy, first-degree robbery, and receiving stolen property, and was sentenced to death and 45 years in prison. The Kentucky Supreme Court affirmed the death sentence, rejecting Stanford's "deman[d] that he has a constitutional right to treatment." Finding that the record clearly demonstrated that "there was no program or treatment appropriate for the appellant in the juvenile justice system," the court held that the juvenile court did not err in certifying Stanford for trial as an adult. The court also stated that Stanford's "age and the possibility that he might be rehabilitated were mitigating factors appropriately left to the consideration of the jury that tried him."

==Oral arguments==
Oral arguments were heard 27 March 1989. Prior to the hearing, briefs of [[amici curiae]] pushing for reversal were filed by the [[American Baptist Churches]], the [[Child Welfare League of America]], and the West Virginia Council of Churches. Briefs supporting the affirmation of the capital sentence were filed by the Attorney General of Kentucky and a number of attorneys general from other states.

In both cases, briefs of amici curiae were put forth by the [[American Bar Association]], the [[American Society for Adolescent Psychiatry]], the [[International Human Rights Group]], and [[Amnesty International]].

Arguments in the defense of petitioners Stanford and Wilkins (see below) were that the application of capital punishment upon defendants who were minors at the time of the offense was unconstitutional because it violated the prohibition of "cruel and unusual punishment" under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution.&lt;ref name=Opinion/&gt;

==Opinion==
In both ''Stanford v. Kentucky'', and the parallel case ''Wilkins v. Missouri'', the Supreme Court affirmed the capital punishments handed down in lower courts. Writing for the majority, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote that neither Stanford or Wilkins asserted that the punishment was cruel or unusual at the time the Bill of Rights was adopted (common law at the time set the incapacity to commit a felony at age 14), and so both petitioners were left to argue that capital punishment for minors older than 14, was contrary to "the evolving standards of decency". This expanse in the review of the Eighth Amendment was not granted in this decision, and Scalia went on to cite precedent limits set in ''[[Gregg v. Georgia]]'' (1976).&lt;ref&gt;Champion, D. J. (2004). The Juvenile Justice System- Delinquency, Processing, and the Law. (4th ed). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;We discern neither a historical nor a modern societal consensus forbidding the imposition of capital punishment on any person who murders at 16 or 17 years of age. Accordingly, we conclude that such punishment does not offend the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. [...] and to mean that as the dissent means it, i.e., that it is for ''us'' to judge, not on the basis of what we perceive the Eighth Amendment originally prohibited, or on the basis of what we perceive the society through its democratic processes now overwhelmingly disapproves, but on the basis of what we think "proportionate" and "measurably contributory to acceptable goals of punishment" -- to say and mean that, is to replace judges of the law with a committee of philosopher-kings.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, although agreeing that no national consensus forbade the imposition of capital punishment on 16- or 17-year-old murderers, concluded that the court has a constitutional obligation to conduct proportionality analysis, (citing ''Penry v. Lynaugh'') and should consider age-based statutory classifications that are relevant to that analysis.&lt;ref name=Opinion/&gt;

Justice Brennan filed a dissenting opinion, in which he was joined by Justices Marshall, Blackmun, and Stevens.

'''Supermarket shortages''' have been identified in many American urban neighborhoods, and such gaps in food access have been closely correlated with diet-related diseases such as [[cancer]], [[obesity]], and [[diabetes]].
The shortage began when many supermarkets left mixed-income central city neighborhoods after civil disturbances in the late 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref name="Ferguson"&gt;Ferguson, Bruce and Barbara Abell. "Attracting Supermarkets to Inner-City Neighborhoods: Economic Development Outside the Box." Economic Development Commentary. Winter 1998, pp. 6-14.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1984, store openings exceeded closings nationally but the opposite held in cities and the trend continues.&lt;ref name = "Eisenhauer"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1023/A:1015772503007 |title=In poor health: Supermarket redlining and urban nutrition |year=2001 |last1=Eisenhauer |first1=Elizabeth |journal=GeoJournal |volume=53 |issue=2 |pages=125–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The reluctance of large chains to open in urban areas is termed by some activists, "supermarket redlining."&lt;ref name = "Eisenhauer"/&gt;  A second study that controlled for population and percent African American found that supermarkets in 1970 were preferred to locate in urban areas with high poverty and low income.&lt;ref name="Thibodeaux"&gt;Thibodeaux, Jarrett, 2016. A Historical Era of Food Deserts Changes in the Correlates of Urban Supermarket Location, 1970–1990. Social Currents, 3(2), pp.186-203.&lt;/ref&gt; Afterward, this trend gradually reversed direction until 1990.&lt;ref name="Thibodeaux"/&gt;

Studies suggest that 21 of America's largest cities experience a grocery gap characterized by fewer stores and less square footage per store.&lt;ref&gt;Cotterill, R.W. and A.W. Franklin. 1995. ''The Urban Grocery Store Gap''. Food Marketing Policy Center Dept. of Agricultural and Resource Economics, University of Conn.&lt;/ref&gt; The poorest neighborhoods typically have about 55% of the grocery square footage of the best-off neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="Ferguson"/&gt; The migration of supermarkets to the suburbs contribute to the creation of so-called [[food desert]]s.  Simultaneously, there is a lower prevalence of independently owned grocery stores in low-wealth and predominantly black neighborhoods and a greater proportion of households without access to private transportation in these neighborhoods.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9&gt;Morland et al. "The Contextual Effect of the Local Food Environment on Residents’ Diets," ''American Journal of Public Health''. November 2002, Vol. 92, No. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Supermarkets generally provide food at cheaper prices than the [[Convenience store|bodegas]] and pharmacies that service inner-city areas. A study that compared supermarkets, neighborhood groceries, convenience stores, and health food stores in San Diego, California found that supermarkets had twice the average number of 'heart-healthy' foods compared to neighborhood grocery stores and four times the average number of such foods compared to [[convenience stores]].&lt;ref name="Morland"&gt;Morland et al. "Neighborhood Characteristics Associated with Location of Food Stores and Food Service Places." American Journal of Preventive Medicine. 2002. Vol. 22, No. 1. pp. 23-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, less supermarkets can mean less easy access to healthy foods, high prices for healthy foods that are available at smaller stores and health problems that result from a consequent unhealthy diet.

==Causes==
Grocery stores typically have only 1-2% [[profit margins]],&lt;ref name="Goldstein"&gt;Goldstein, Amy. "In Cities, Healthful Living Through Fresher Shopping." ''The Washington Post.'' (Maryland Edition) Oct. 15. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; so the difficulties involved in running an urban supermarket are often seen as too costly in an already-risky business. A combination of other factors make urban neighborhoods seem less-than-ideal for grocery store executives.

===Market===
Urban stores in low-income neighborhoods generally have less demand for the profitable luxury goods that are more popular in suburban stores.&lt;ref name="Goldstein"/&gt; Also, people who shop with food stamps usually buy fewer [[nonperishable]] items like [[toiletries]] and impulse items, the things that bring stores their highest profits.&lt;ref name="Purvis"/&gt;

Instead, urban stores must stock a variety of lower-volume items geared to multiethnic tastes.&lt;ref name="Eckholm"&gt;Eckholm, Eric. "In Market, Hopes for Health and Urban Renewal." ''The New York Times''. May 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Compounding the problem, chain stores are generally unfamiliar with ethnic preferences. Chains tend to develop a formula that works for their core market, which consists of middle-class, white suburbanites.&lt;ref name="Ferguson"/&gt;

One obstacle to supermarket growth is that developers tend to overlook the market potential of urban communities. Underserved, urban neighborhoods tend to be composed of populations with lower incomes on average, but the density of an urban environment also means that city neighborhoods tend to have more income per acre than suburban areas. Studies by the Initiative for a Competitive Inner City in Boston found that "nearly 8 million people who live in the nation's poorest urban communities have a combined $85 billion in retail spending power, which is far greater than all of Mexico."&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, Michael A. "More Retailers Are Sold on Cities." ''The Washington Post.'' March 5, 1999. pp. E01&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stereotypes===
[[Prejudices]] have biased [[marketing research]] and prevented supermarkets from seeing the potential of urban locations. National marketing firms have provided grocery store executives with statistics derived from flawed modeling techniques. These statistics include erroneous information about population decline, the perpetuation of stereotypes about the people who live in urban communities, and miscalculated income information.&lt;ref&gt;Pawasarat, John and Lois M. Quinn. "Exposing Urban Legends: The Real Purchasing Power of Central City Neighborhoods." The Brookings Institution, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, media portray urban areas as poor and dependent, contributing to supermarket executives' skepticism. In fact, urban areas usually consist overwhelmingly of working households with a substantial share of middle-income people.&lt;ref name="Ferguson"/&gt;

===Security===
A problem in urban and suburban stores alike, shoplifting is 6% to 8% of supermarket revenues.&lt;ref name="Ferguson"/&gt; Fear of crime also acts as a big deterrent for investors, but some cities interested in developing new grocery stores have placed police stations near development sites in order to allay developers' fears.

===Land===
The expense and scarcity of land in urban environments pose some of the greatest problems for supermarket developers.&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;Jones, Charisse. "Cities bring markets to the needy." ''USA Today.'' Nov. 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Finding sites for urban development also involves fees, complexity, length, and unpredictability.&lt;ref name="Ferguson"/&gt;

Today's suburban supermarket model requires more space than older, urban facilities can accommodate,&lt;ref name="Eckholm"/&gt; meaning that urban supermarket development often requires the construction of new facilities. And, while suburban supermarkets are typically {{convert|45000|sqft|m2}}, urban supermarkets are only {{convert|25000|sqft|m2}} on average. This means that urban supermarkets can sell significantly fewer products than suburban stores, which contributes to fewer profits.&lt;ref name="Jones"/&gt;

==Community issues==
A grocery store's 24-hour lighting "does a lot for the sense of safety and community in the neighborhood," because supermarkets can be a safe haven.&lt;ref name="Eckholm"/&gt; Citizens feel a "dramatic change in atmosphere," after new supermarkets are built.&lt;ref name="Jones"/&gt;

In addition, new supermarkets can be used as location of community programs—health exams, nutritional education, eye exams, voter registration, birthdays for children,&lt;ref name="Ferguson"/&gt; Western Union wire transfers so immigrants can wire remittances,&lt;ref name="Goldstein"/&gt; selling event tickets, having Driver’s License renewal facilities, and providing phones for discount international calls.&lt;ref name="Ferguson"/&gt; Besides contributing to a community’s overall well-being, such services make a grocery store more appealing to urban consumers: developing the services that urban citizens desire is a crucial way to make new supermarket development work.

By engaging with local organizations, supermarkets can create a link with a community that will contribute to security, reduction in shrinkage, and provide for better selection and effectiveness of employees. Organizations (such as churches) can help in hiring decisions, and security guards can come from the community.&lt;ref name="Ferguson"/&gt; These make security more effective, bring jobs to communities, and make customers brand-loyal. Grocery should also confer with local religious officials about religious diets.&lt;ref name="Ferguson"/&gt;

Stores should also keep in mind the shopping habits of urban consumers, who often rely on monies distributed to them at the beginning of each month. Stores may want to "staff to accommodate strong demand in the first two weeks of the month, slack purchases in the last week, and heavier traffic that purchases less per customer in general,"&lt;ref name="Ferguson"/&gt; according to the shopping habits of urban consumers.

Grocery stores should consider developing diversity departments within supermarket administration to identify minority-owned suppliers and potential employees.&lt;ref name="Purvis"&gt;Purvis, Kathleen. "Lack of transportation compromises health." ''Charlotte Sun.'' Feb. 09, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Racial issues==
Racial and wealth segregation remain prominent characteristics of US neighborhoods.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}.  Studies suggest that predominantly black neighborhoods suffer from a greater lack of access to healthy food,{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} although this was not always the case.&lt;ref name="Thibodeaux"/&gt;

Of 216 US census tracts studied, the ratio of supermarkets to residents for predominantly white areas is 1:3816 versus 1:23,582 for predominantly black neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="Purvis"/&gt; Only 8% of black Americans lived in a census tract with at least one supermarket; 31% of Whites live in a census tract with at least one supermarket.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9 /&gt;  In fact, aside from region and economic health, studies find that proportion of blacks in the population can affect an area's likelihood of having a supermarket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Small | first1 = Mario L. | last2 = McDermott | first2 = Monica | year = 2006 | title = The presence of organizational resources in poor urban neighborhoods: An analysis of average and contextual effects | url = | journal = Social Forces | volume = 84 | issue = 3| pages = 1697–1724 | doi=10.1353/sof.2006.0067}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thibodeaux | first1 = Jarrett | year = 2016 | title = City racial composition as a predictor of African American food deserts | url = | journal = Urban Studies | volume = 53 | issue = 11| pages = 2238–2252 | doi=10.1177/0042098015587848}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case studies==
Many cities and states across the US have recognized the urban supermarket gap problem and have developed plans to address the issue of food access.  Additionally, the U.S. federal government established the [[Healthy Food Financing Initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2010pres/02/20100219a.html |title=Obama Administration Details Healthy Food Financing Initiative (Archived copy) |publisher=U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services |accessdate=2013-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801224105/http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2010pres/02/20100219a.html |date=2010|archivedate=2013-08-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative provided more than $400 million in funding from the Treasury Department, USDA and Department of Health and Human Services to promote expanding access to nutritious foods, including developing and equipping grocery stores and other small retailers to sell healthful food in low-income rural and urban communities that currently lack this option.

===Pennsylvania===
In April 2003, Pennsylvania passed the nation's first statewide economic development initiative aimed at improving access to markets that sell healthy food in underserved rural and urban communities. The legislation devoted $100 million to agriculture projects, including the development of grocery stores and farmers' markets, and $40 million to support the development of 10 new stores in underserved communities across Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Flournoy, Rebecca and Sarah Treuhaft. "Healthy Food, Healthy Communities: Improving Access and Opportunities Through Food Retailing." PolicyLink and the California Endowment, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting Fresh Food Financing Initiative was a public-private partnership in association with [[The Food Trust]] started in 2004 with state seed funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.2009.0740 |pmid=20194989|title=Policy solutions to the 'grocery gap' |journal=Health Aff (Millwood) |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=473–480 |year=2010 |last1=Story |first1=A|last2=Manon |first2=M |last3=Treuhaft |first3=S|last4=Giang |first4=T|last5=Harries |first5=C|last6=McCoubrey |first6=K}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harries"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.2009.0740 |pmid=24594793 |pmc=4204010|title=Moving From Policy to Implementation: A Methodology and Lessons Learned to Determine Eligibility for Healthy Food Financing Projects|journal=J Public Health Manag Pract |volume=20 |issue=5|pages=498–505 |year=2014 |last1=Story |first1=Caroline |last2=Harries|first2=Julia |last3=Koprak |first3=Candace |last4=Weiss|first4=Stephanie |last5=Parker|first5=Kathryn M|last6=Karpyn|first6=Allison }}&lt;/ref&gt; The program encouraged the development of new supermarkets by providing grants of up to $250,000 or loans of up to $2.5 million per store to defray the infrastructure costs of developing a new store.&lt;ref name=VerPloeg2009&gt;{{cite book |last=Ver Ploeg |first= Michele |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ChwzY1-x_6QC|title=Access to Affordable and Nutritious Food: Measuring and Understanding Food Deserts and Their Consequences: Report to Congress|publisher=DIANE Publishing |year=2009 |isbn=978-1-4379-2134-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Dutko, P. |url=http://www.choicesmagazine.org/choices-magazine/theme-articles/an-evaluation-of-food-deserts-in-america/food-deserts-suffer-persistent-socioeconomic-disadvantage | title = Food Deserts Suffer Persistent Socioeconomic Disadvantage | journal = Choices | volume = 27 | issue = 3 | pages = 1–4 | date = Fall 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Up to 2009, $41.8 million in grants and loans have funded 58 stores.&lt;ref name="VerPloeg2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Success of the initiative led to the creation of similar programs in at least seven states and cities, like the New York City Food Retail Expansion to Support Health (FRESH) program.&lt;ref name="Harries"/&gt;

===New York City===
{{Main|Food and Water in New York City}}

Like many other cities in the US, [[New York City]] faces a supermarket shortage that is closely linked to health epidemics. At the request of the Mayor’s office, the Department of City Planning studied supermarket need in the city and, in April 2008, found a widespread shortage of supermarkets. This shortage causes a lack of healthy, fair-priced food options for many New Yorkers who live in a [[food desert]]. Food access issues are partly responsible for the facts that diabetes now affects over 700,000 people in New York City, over 1.1 million New Yorkers are obese, and another 2 million are overweight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/supermarket/index.shtml "Going to Market: New York City's Neighborhood Grocery Store and Supermarket Shortage] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016051109/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/supermarket/index.shtml |date=2012-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Health problems are especially prevalent in minority communities, and statistics indicate a racial dimension to the crisis: Supermarkets in [[Harlem]] are 30% less common than on the [[Upper East Side]], and while 20% of Upper East Side bodegas carried leafy green vegetables, only 3% of those in Harlem could say the same.&lt;ref&gt;[http://council.nyc.gov/html/releases/011_022708_prestated_greencarts.shtml New York City Council - The Council of the City of New York&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Three million New Yorkers live in neighborhoods with high need for grocery stores and supermarkets. Neighborhoods such as Central and [[Spanish Harlem]] and [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]] in [[Manhattan]]; [[Bushwick]], [[Bedford Stuyvesant]], [[East New York]] and [[Sunset Park, Brooklyn|Sunset Park]] in [[Brooklyn]]; [[Corona, Queens|Corona]], [[Jamaica, Queens|Jamaica]] and [[Far Rockaway, Queens|Far Rockaway]] in [[Queens]]; areas of the [[South Bronx]], [[Williamsbridge, Bronx|Williamsbridge/Wakefield]] and portions of [[Pelham Parkway (neighborhood), Bronx|Pelham Parkway]] in [[the Bronx]]; and [[St. George, Staten Island|St. George]] and [[Stapleton, Staten Island|Stapleton]] in [[Staten Island]] show the greatest need for full-line supermarkets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/supermarket/index.shtml Socioeconomic &amp; Housing - Going to Market: New York City’sNeighborhood Grocery Store andSupermarket Shortage&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016051109/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/supermarket/index.shtml |date=2012-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February, 2008, Speaker [[Christine C. Quinn|Christine Quinn]] of the City Council announced the creation of a Statewide Supermarket Commission to identify state and local policy solutions to encourage new supermarket development and prevent supermarkets from closing. The Commission was led by the Food Trust and the Food Bank for New York City, in partnership with the City’s Food Policy Coordinator and the Food Industry Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://council.nyc.gov/html/releases/011_022708_prestated_greencarts.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, the [[United Food and Commercial Workers]] Local 1500, which represents grocery store workers, is working to create healthy food options for all New Yorkers through supermarkets, [[Community-supported agriculture]], [[urban agriculture]], and farmers' markets.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The FRESH program attempts to increase access to full-service grocery stores in designated "underserved" areas with help in zoning incentives, abatements of land and building taxes for 25 years and other tax subsidies such as sales tax exemptions on building materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/misc/pdf/fresh_fact_sheet_eng.pdf |title=The Food Retail Expansion to Support Health (FRESH) program |publisher=New York City Economic Development Corporation |location=New York, NY|access-date=July 21, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===California===

In Oakland's flatlands, the development of low-income communities, lowered real estate values, zoning restrictions, land parcel sizes and property taxes discouraged supermarkets and other full-service food retailers.&lt;ref name="McClintock"&gt;{{cite book |last=McClintock |first=Nathan |date=2008 |title=From Industrial garden to food desert: Unearthing the root structure of urban agriculture in Oakland, California |publisher=Department of Geography, University of California | series =Institute for the Study of Social Change Fellows Working Papers| url =http://escholarship.org/uc/item/1wh3v1sj }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Corner stores, convenience stores and liquor stores took root where commercial parcels were too small to accommodate a grocery store.&lt;ref name="McClintock"/&gt;  Overall, supermarket penetration largely drove down the number of grocery stores in West Oakland from 137 in 1960 to 22 in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fuller |first=Andrea |date=2004 |title=A History of Food Insecurity in West Oakland, CA : Supermarket Location |location=Oakland, CA |publisher=People's Grocery}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 1990s, many supermarkets in the flatlands also closed their doors to invest in more profitable areas.&lt;ref name="McClintock"/&gt;

By 2005, [[The California Endowment]] and its then-$26 million initiative California FreshWorks set out to increase availability of healthy food options by investing in grocery stores in low-income and minority communities.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Harries"/&gt; As of 2014, about $264 million had been raised from a variety of investors.&lt;ref name="Harries"/&gt;

===Illinois===
The [http://www.healthyfoodaccess.org/funding/available-funding/illinois-fresh-food-fund Illinois Fresh Food] begun with a $10 million state grant was set up to finance full-service grocery stores in neighborhoods with little access to fresh foods.&lt;ref name="Harries"/&gt;

Chicago's Retail Chicago Program is outreach program for retailers, brokers, and developers to introduce them to the many community retail development opportunities in Chicago and expedite their entry into these new markets by serving as a "One Stop Shop" to assist them during their site selection process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://egov.cityofchicago.org/city/webportal/portalContentItemAction.do?contentOID=536897571&amp;contenTypeName=COC_EDITORIAL&amp;topChannelName=HomePage Retail Chicago Program]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other states===
Similar programs created after Pennsylvania's initiative include the New Jersey Food Access Initiative and Colorado Fresh Food Financing Fund ad at the city level with New Orleans Fresh Food Retailer Initiative and Cincinnati Fresh Food Financing Fund.&lt;ref name="Harries"/&gt;

==Economic effects==
Besides causing a lack of access to healthy foods, the urban supermarket gap also means that inner city neighborhoods lack the jobs and tax revenues that grocery stores provide.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Strategies==
Where supermarket developers have neglected some urban neighborhoods, city governments and non-profits can work together to market the potential of inner city areas to grocery store executives.  Chicago’s planning department provided an information guide with a database of suitable land parcels to executives at a grocers’ expo in 2005.&lt;ref name="Ferguson"/&gt;

Many of Oakland’s existing food retail businesses are located within Redevelopment Areas, allowing them to qualify for redevelopment fund assistance.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10&gt;Unger, Serena. Wooten, Heather. A Food Systems Assessment for Oakland, CA: Toward a Sustainable Food Plan. Oakland Mayor’s Office of Sustainability, University of California, Berkeley, Department of City and Regional Planning. June 21, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  The Food Systems Assessment Report for Oakland suggested the creation of Food Retail Enterprise Zones, whereby food retailers that provide nutritious foods in poor neighborhoods are exempt from Oakland business taxes. It also suggested programs, like the Green Business certification program could award “Green and Healthy Oakland” certification to retail establishments that stock food or offer menu items conforming to specific criteria (fresh, nutritious, local, etc.) &lt;ref name="autogenerated10"/&gt;

Market leaders close urban stores, even if they are showing a profit, to focus on the most productive stores in the suburbs. But "operators in second and third place in a metro area may seek to expand their core clientele outside the highly contested, white suburbs to other areas and groups, such as the mixed-income neighborhoods and ethnic clients in the central city."&lt;ref name="Ferguson"/&gt; Baltimore initially attracted "low-level" chains and "now, upscale, full-service stores wants to locate in areas they had previous ignored."&lt;ref name="Jones"/&gt;

Executives’ fears of security costs may be easily abated: Rochester clinched the deal with a Tops supermarket by offering to locate a police station at the development site.&lt;ref name="Ferguson"/&gt; Hiring locals as security guards helps decrease security issues and losses to shrinkage.&lt;ref name="Ferguson"/&gt;

==Criticisms==
Despite the widespread efforts to address supermarket shortages and food deserts, not all researchers are convinced that such areas are common. At least one [http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/extract/325/7361/436 medical review] and a later [http://www.ers.usda.gov/Publications/AP/AP036/ government report] have suggested that food deserts are relatively rare. Nevertheless, their purported existence continues to drive significant public health expenditures.

'''Sursilvan''' ({{Audio|Roh-Sursilvan-Sursilvan.ogg|[suʁsilˈvan]}} or ''romontsch sursilvan'' [ʁoˈmɔntʃ suʁsilˈvan]) is a group of dialects of the [[Romansh language]] spoken in the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] district of [[Surselva District|Surselva]]. It is the most widely spoken variety of Romansh with 17,897 people within the [[Surselva District]] (54.8%) naming Romansh as a habitually spoken language in the Swiss census of 2000.&lt;ref name="Gross31"&gt;Gross (2004). p. 31 {{dead link|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most closely related variety is [[Sutsilvan]], which is spoken in the area located to the east of the district.

The name of the dialect and the Surselva District is derived from ''sur'' 'above' and ''selva'' 'forest', with the forest in question being the ''Uaul Grond'' in the area affected by the [[Flims Rockslide]]. The word ''selva'' itself has fallen out of use in modern Sursilvan, with the most common word for forest being {{Audio|Roh-sursilvan-uaul.ogg|''uaul''}}, an [[Old High German]] loanword. ''Selva'' is only used for in a few more recent terms such as ''selvicultura'' 'forestry', ''selvicultur'' 'forest officer', or ''cavrer selvadi'' '[[Long-eared owl]]'.

== Distribution ==
[[File:Lubiu traffic.jpg|thumb|a Sursilvan traffic sign]]
Sursilvan is used across most of the [[Surselva District]], with the exception of the [[Walser]] villages of [[Obersaxen]], [[Vals GR|Vals]], [[St. Martin GR|St. Martin]] and [[Safiental]]. Outside of the Surselva District, [[Flims]] is also part of the Sursilvan dialect area. In addition, Sursilvan was previously used as the written Romansh language of parts of the [[Sutsilvan]] dialect area. When a separate Sutsilvan written language was introduced in 1944, the villages of [[Bonaduz]], [[Rhäzüns|Rhäzün s]], [[Domat/Ems]] and [[Trin]] retained Sursilvan as their written language. In addition, Sursilvan was previously used in the [[Surmiran]] dialect area as the language of church, but has now been replaced by Standard Surmiran and [[Rumantsch Grischun]].

Most municipalities in which Sursilvan is the traditional language still have a Romansh-speaking majority today. The exceptions are 
[[Flims]], [[Laax]], [[Schnaus]], [[Ilanz]], [[Castrisch]], [[Surcuolm]], and [[Duvin]]. In all of these, except for Flims, however, a majority of people reported in the 2000 Swiss census to use Romansh daily, even if only a minority named it as their language of best command. In about half of the Sursilvan villages, Romansh is the language of best command of over 70% or 80%. The highest percentage is found in [[Vrin]] with over 95%. As a daily language, it is used in nearly all municipalities by at least 70%, in about half by more than 80%, and in a third by over 90%. Overall across the Sursilvan dialect area, in the census of 2000, 70.1% named Romansh as a habitually used language, while 58.3% named it as their language of best command.&lt;ref&gt;Cathomas (2008). pp. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

== Morphology ==

=== Nouns ===

Sursilvan nouns distinguish two genders (masculine and feminine) and two numbers (singular and plural).

Nouns in -a are overwhelmingly feminine (with few exceptions such as duca 'duke'). Nouns in consonants or other vowels can be either masculine or feminine.

Plurals are formed with the suffix -s. Nouns already ending in -s do not add this plural ending, but nouns in -z and -sch follow the general rule. Nominalised past participles in -au have a plural in -ai. In addition, nouns may show vowel alternations or other irregularities:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Type !! Sg !! Pl !! Meaning (gender)
|-
| Regular + -s || frar || frars || brother (m.)
|-
|         || sora || soras || sister (f.)
|-
|         || esch || eschs || door (m.)
|-

|-
|                || ies || oss || bone (m.)
|-
|                || tgaubriechel || tgaubrochels || somersault (m.)
|-
| -ie- &gt; -o- + -s (with irreg.) || piertg || pors || pig (m.)
|-

|-
| -ie- &gt; -ia- + -s || vierm || viarms || worm (m.)
|-
| -ie- &gt; -ia- (no -s) || viers || viars || animal noise (m.)

|-
|  || dunna || dunnauns (also: dunnas) || woman (f.)
|-
|  || matta || mattauns (also: mattas) || girl (f.)
|-
|  || liug || loghens (also: logs) || place (m.) 
|}

==== Collective plurals ====

In addition to the normal plural in -s many nouns also show a collective plural in -a. These forms typically occur with natural substances (rocks, wood, plants etc.) and human body parts. Syntactically these collective plurals behave like feminine singular nouns: ''La crappa ei dira.'' 'The rocks are hard. / The rock (= material) is hard.' (with f.sg. dira 'hard' agreeing with the subject la crappa 'the rock(s)') and may best be considered as an intermediate formation between inflection and derivation (Liver 1999:132).

=== Articles ===

Sursilvan has both a definite and an indefinite article. These are preposed and agree with their noun in gender and number. (The indefinite article only has singular forms.) Forms may differ depending on whether the following word starts with a vowel or a consonant:

==== Indefinite Article ====

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| masc. || '''in''' fegl || 'son'
|-
|  || '''in''' amitg || 'male friend'
|-
| fem. before cons. || '''ina''' feglia || 'daughter'
|-
| fem. before vowel || '''in''''amitga || 'female friend'
|}

==== Definite Article ====

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! !! !! Sg !! Pl !! 
|-
|rowspan=2| '''masc.''' || '''before cons.''' || '''il''' bab || '''ils''' babs || 'father'
|-
| '''before vowel'''  || '''igl''' aug || '''ils''' augs || 'uncle'
|-
|rowspan=2| '''fem.''' || '''before cons.''' || '''la''' mumma || '''las''' mummas || 'mother'
|-
| '''before vowel''' || '''l''''onda || '''las''' ondas || 'aunt'
|}

The definite article contracts with a number of prepositions:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! !! il !! igl !! la !! l' !! ils !! las
|-
| '''a''' 'to' || al || agl || alla || all' || als || allas
|-
| '''cun''' 'with' || cul || cugl || culla || cull' || culs || cullas
|-
| '''da''' 'of, by' || dil || digl || dalla || dall' || dils || dallas
|-
| '''en''' 'in(to)' || el || egl || ella || ell' || els || ellas
|-
| '''per''' 'for' || pil || pigl || pella || pell' || pils || pellas
|-
| '''sin''' 'on (to)' || sil || sigl || silla || sill' || sils || sillas
|-
| '''sper''' 'beside' || spel || spegl || spella || spell' || spels || spellas
|-
| '''tier''' 'to, at' || tiel || tiegl || tiella || tiell' || tiels || tiellas
|}

=== Adjectives ===

The adjective agrees with its noun in gender and number and (as in other Romance languages) usually follows it. 

A peculiarity of Sursilvan is that the adjective distinguishes an attributive and a predicative form in the masculine singular:

''in um vegl'' 'an old man'&lt;br&gt;
''igl um ei vegls'' 'the man is old'

The predicative masculine singular form is morphologically identical with the masculine plural. 

The ending of the masculine plural is -s. Feminine adjectives suffix -a in the singular and -as in the plural. 
The attributive masculine singular often differs from the other forms in its vocalism.

* Modern Sursilvan has no unstressed proclitic personal pronouns appearing in preverbal position (as in French ''je l'ai vu'' 'I have seen him') and only uses the (historically) stressed forms, which appear in the same position as nouns: ''jeu hai viu el'' 'I have seen him'.
* In the 1Sg and 2Sg the special dative forms ''mi'' and ''ti'' exist, which are used after the preposition ''a(d)'' 'to'. In the 3Sg ''agli'' is occasionally used instead of ''ad el''.
* In the 3rd person Sursilvan has a neuter pronoun ''ei'' (''igl'' before ''ei'' 'is'): ''ei plova'' 'it rains', ''igl ei tard'' 'it is late'. This pronoun is also used as an expletive pronoun in sentences like ''ei vegn ora in drag cun siat tgaus'' 'there emerges [lit: it comes out] a dragon with seven heads'. The same form can be used with 3Pl verb forms as a gender-neutral 'they/people' (French ''on'', German ''man''): ''ei dian'' 'they/people say'.

* The proximal pronoun ''quel'' 'this' and the distal pronoun ''tschel'' 'that' have different forms in the masc. sg. depending on whether they are used adjectivally with a noun or pronominally on their own (referring to a masculine noun): ''El va vitier &lt;u&gt;quei um vegl&lt;/u&gt;, e &lt;u&gt;quel&lt;/u&gt; gi,...'' 'he goes to &lt;u&gt;this old man&lt;/u&gt;, and &lt;u&gt;this one&lt;/u&gt; says...'.
* ''Quel'' and ''tschel'' have pronominal neuter forms ''quei'' and ''tschei'' (formally identical with the &lt;u&gt;adjectival&lt;/u&gt; masculine forms).
* ''Quest'', which in other Rhetoromance dialects serves as proximal demonstrative, is in modern Sursilvan limited to fixed expression such ''quest onn'' 'this year', ''questa sera'' 'this evening'.

'''Wymysorys''' (''Wymysiöeryś''), also known as '''Vilamovian''' or '''Wilamowicean''', is a variety of [[High German]], spoken in the small town of [[Wilamowice]], [[Poland]] (''Wymysoü'' in Wymysorys), on the border between [[Silesia]] and [[Lesser Poland]], near [[Bielsko-Biała]].&lt;ref name="ELOW"&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/language/wym/ Ethnologue: Languages of the World - Wymysorys]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ISO639"&gt;[http://www-01.sil.org/ISO639-3/documentation.asp?id=wym Documentation for ISO 639 identifier: wym]&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered an [[endangered language]].&lt;ref name="ELOW" /&gt; There are probably between 70 and 100&lt;ref name="ELOW" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wicherkiewicz"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Tomasz Wicherkiewicz |coauthors= |editor1= |others= |title=The Making of a Language: The Case of the Idiom of Wilamowice |trans-title=|url= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=2003 |publisher=[[Mouton de Gruyter]] |location= |ISBN=3-11-017099-X |oclc= |page=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; native users of Wymysorys, virtually all bilingual; the majority are elderly.&lt;ref name="ELOW" /&gt;

==History==
In origin, Wymysorys appears to derive from 12th-century [[Middle High German]], with a strong influence from [[Low German]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Polish language|Polish]],  [[Old English]] and perhaps [[Frisian languages|Frisian]].&lt;ref name="ELOW" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/8290384/Some_Considerations_on_the_Origins_of_Wymysorys&lt;/ref&gt; The inhabitants of Wilamowice are thought to be descendants of [[Kingdom of Germany|German]], [[Flanders|Flemish]] and [[Scotland|Scottish]] settlers who arrived in Poland during the 13th century. However, the inhabitants of Wilamowice always denied any connections with Germany and proclaimed their Flemish origins.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fil.wilamowice.pl/upload/file/PDF/knack2002.pdf Knack, issue 31, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Although related to German, Wymysorys is not [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] with Standard German (that is the case for most other [[German dialects]] as well).&lt;ref name="Wicherkiewicz-15"&gt;Wicherkiewicz, op.cit., p.15&lt;/ref&gt;

Wymysorys was the [[vernacular]] language of Wilamowice until 1939–1945. However, it seems it has been in decline since the late 19th century. In 1880 as many as 92% of the town's inhabitants spoke Wymysorys (1525 out of 1662), in 1890 - only 72%, in 1900 - 67%, in 1910 - 73% again.&lt;ref name="Wicherkiewicz-10"&gt;Wicherkiewicz, op.cit., p.10&lt;/ref&gt; Although Wymysorys was taught in local schools (under the name of "local variety of German"), since 1875 the basic language of instruction in most schools in Austro-Hungarian [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] was Polish.&lt;ref name="Wicherkiewicz-10"/&gt; During [[World War II]] and the [[History of Poland (1939–45)|German occupation of Poland]] Wymysorys was openly promoted by the Nazi administration, but after the war the tables turned: local [[communism|communist]] authorities forbade the use of Wymysorys in any form.&lt;ref name="Wicherkiewicz-10"/&gt; The widespread bilingualism of the people saved most local residents from being [[flight and expulsion of Germans from Poland during and after World War II|forcibly resettled]] to Germany, many of them stopped teaching their children their language or even using it in daily life.&lt;ref name="Wicherkiewicz-12"&gt;Wicherkiewicz, op.cit., p.12&lt;/ref&gt; Although the ban was lifted after 1956, Wymysorys has been gradually replaced by Polish, especially amongst the younger generation. 

Acting on a proposal by Tymoteusz Król, the [[Library of Congress]] added the Wymysorys language to the register of languages on July 18, 2007.&lt;ref name="Jeszcze"&gt;{{cite video | people =Darek Golik | year =2010 | title =Wymysiöeryś – jeszcze mowa nie zginęła | url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfg3jHV1TzE | format = | medium = |trans-title=Wymysiöeryś - the language has not yet perished | publisher =Agencja Fotograficzna Fotorzepa, [[Rzeczpospolita (newspaper)|Rzeczpospolita]] | location =Warsaw | time =7:25|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also registered in the [[International Organization for Standardization]], where it received the ''wym'' [[ISO 639-3]] code.&lt;ref name="ISO639" /&gt; In a 2009 [[UNESCO]] report Wymysorys has been reported as "severely endangered" and nearly extinct.&lt;ref name="Jeszcze"/&gt; 

Wymysorys was the language of the [[poetry]] of [[Florian Biesik]], during the 19th century.{{Fact|date=December 2017}}

==Revitalization==
Some new revitalization efforts have been started within the first decade of the 21st century, led by speaker Tymoteusz Król, whose efforts include private lessons with a group of pupils as well as compiling language records, standardizing written orthography and compiling the first ever dictionary of Wymysorys. Additionally, a new project called The Wymysiöeryśy Akademyj – Accademia Wilamowicziana or WA-AW was established under the "Artes Liberales" program at the University of Warsaw with the intention of creating a unified scholastic body for the study of the Wymysorys language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Revitalizing Endangered Languages - Wymysorys Language |last=Ritchie|first=Carlos|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alphabet==
Wymysorys has been for centuries mostly a spoken language. It was not until the times of [[Florian Biesik]], the first author of major literary works in the language, that a need for a separate version of a Latin alphabet arose. Biesik wrote most of his works in plain [[Polish alphabet]], which he considered better-suited for the phonetics of his language.&lt;ref name="Wicherkiewicz-24"&gt;Wicherkiewicz, op.cit., p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; In recent times [[Józef Gara]] (1929–2013), another author of works in the local language, devised a distinct Wymysorys alphabet, consisting of 34 letters derived from the [[Latin script]] and mostly based on Polish as well:

Wilamowicean orthography includes the [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]] "AO", which is treated as a separate letter.
