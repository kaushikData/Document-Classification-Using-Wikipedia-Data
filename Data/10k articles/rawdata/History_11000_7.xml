The '''5th century BC''' started the first day of [[500 BC]] and ended the last day of [[401 BC]].

[[File:ac.parthenon5.jpg|thumb|300px|The Parthenon of [[Athens]] seen from the hill of the Pnyx to the west. Location 23°43'35.69"E 37°58'17.39"N]]

This century saw the establishment of [[Pataliputra]] as a capital of the [[Magadha]] Empire. This city would later become the ruling capital of different Indian kingdoms for about a thousand years. This period saw the rise of two great philosophical schools of the east, [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]]. 
This period saw [[Mahavira]] and [[Buddha]] spreading their respective teachings in the northern plains of India. This essentially changed the socio-cultural and political dynamics of the region of South Asia. [[Buddhism]] would later go on to become one of the major world religions.

This period also saw the work of [[Yaska]], who created [[Nirukta]], that would lay the foundation stone for [[Sanskrit]] grammar and is one of the oldest works on grammar known to mankind.  
 
This century is also traditionally recognized as the classical period of the [[Greeks]], which would continue all the way through the [[4th century BC|4th century]] until the time of [[Alexander the Great]]. The life of [[Socrates]] represented a major milestone in [[Greek philosophy]] though his teachings only survive through the work of his students, most notably [[Plato]] and [[Xenophon]]. The tragedians [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]], and [[Euripides]], as well as the comedian [[Aristophanes]] all date from this era and many of their works are still considered classics of the western theatrical canon.

The [[Persian Wars]], fought between a coalition of Greek cities and the vast [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] [[Persian Empire]] was a pivotal moment in Greek politics. After having successfully prevented the annexation of Greece by the Persians, Sparta, the dominant power in the coalition, had no intention of further offensive action and considered the war over. Meanwhile, Athens counter-attacked, liberating Greek subjects of the Persian Empire up and down the Ionian coast and mobilizing a new coalition, the [[Delian League]]. Tensions between Athens, and its growing imperialistic ambitions as leader of the Delian League, and the traditionally dominant Sparta led to a protracted stalemate in the [[Peloponnesian war]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9542">The '''Advisory Council on Underwater Archaeology''' (ACUA) serves as an international advisory body on issues relating to underwater archaeology, conservation, and submerged cultural resources management. It works to educate scholars, governments, sport divers, and the public about underwater archaeology and the preservation of underwater cultural heritage. The ACUA&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://acuaonline.org/about-the-acua/|title=» About the ACUA|website=acuaonline.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an independent, [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit organization]] closely affiliated with the [[Society for Historical Archaeology]] (SHA). The ACUA helps the SHA Conference Committee to organize the annual [https://sha.org/conferences/ SHA Conference on Historical and Underwater Archaeology] and provides continuing education through workshops and panel discussions.

The ACUA [https://acuaonline.org/ website], [https://acuaonline.org/category/deep-thoughts/ blog], and social media platforms provide a forum for discussion and information sharing related to underwater and maritime archaeology to encourage the responsible stewardship, preservation, and protection of underwater and maritime cultural heritage. In 2013 the ACUA was recognized as an NGO by [[UNESCO]]. It actively participates in the meetings of the UNESCO Scientific and Technical Advisory Body  (STAB) on the promotion of the [http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13520&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html Convention on the Protection of Underwater Cultural Heritage].

== Mission ==
The Advisory Council on Underwater Archaeology advocates, promotes, and provides advice on responsible public education and stewardship of underwater cultural heritage for present and future generations.

The ACUA supports the ethical principals&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://acuaonline.org/about-the-acua/ethics-statement/|title=» Ethics Statement|website=acuaonline.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Society for Historical Archaeology. The ACUA encourages all archaeologists to perform to the highest standards of integrity and professionalism. The organization's Core Principles&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://acuaonline.org/about-the-acua/core-principles/|title=» Core Principles|website=acuaonline.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; promote an ethical culture in all activities, in the work place, in the field, and in the classroom to create a climate of trust, respect, and equality. The ACUA provides further guidance on ethical obligations and standards of behavior through its statements on [https://acuaonline.org/wp-content/uploads/Statement-on-Harassment.pdf anti-harassment] and [https://acuaonline.org/wp-content/uploads/Non-Discrimination-Polocy.pdf anti-discrimination].

== Formation ==
The ACUA has been at the forefront of underwater archaeology for nearly 60 years and it the oldest organization of its type.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://acuaonline.org/wp-content/uploads/History-of-the-ACUA-1.pdf|title=History of the Advisory Council on Underwater Archaeology|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its genesis as the Council on Underwater Archaeology was in 1959 and its purpose was fully realized at a meeting in 1963 when a group of archaeologists, historians, and sport divers met in St. Paul, Minnesota for the first international Conference on Underwater Archaeology (CUA).

The first joint conference with the then fledgling Society for Historical Archaeology was held in 1970. By 1973, the present structure and name of the ACUA were established and shortly thereafter the SHA and CUA conferences merged. In 2003, the ACUA and SHA signed a Memorandum of Agreement, formalizing their relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://acuaonline.org/about-the-acua/organizational-documents/|title=Organizational Documents of the ACUA|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications ==
The ACUA maintains several publications including: 
* ''[https://www.acuaonline.org/publications/ ACUA Underwater Archaeology Proceedings]'' comprising papers given at the annual SHA Conference. 
* [https://acuaonline.org/category/deep-thoughts/ Archaeological Photo Festival Competition] open to all SHA members to promote public outreach and education between underwater and terrestrial archaeology. Photos from the annual competition are used for an annual calendar provided to all SHA Conference attendees.
* The quarterly [https://acuaonline.org/education-careers/student-rep/ ACUA Student Newsletter], , published by the ACUA Graduate Student Members, which focuses on student research and field projects related to underwater archaeology.
* An introductory brochure on underwater archaeology available for download online in English, Spanish, and Portuguese.

== Training ==
The ACUA offers a full-day ''Submerged Cultural Resources Awareness Workshop'' annually during the SHA Conference on Historical and Underwater Archaeology. This workshop introduces non-specialists to issues specific to underwater archaeology. Participants learn about different types of underwater cultural heritage (UCH) sites, and the techniques used in Phase I and II equivalent surveys. This workshop does not teach participants to be underwater archaeologists, but introduces different investigative techniques, international Best Practices, and existing legislation. The purpose of this workshop is to assist non-specialists in:
* recognizing the potential for UCH resources in their areas of impact,
* budgeting for UCH resource investigations,
* reviewing UCH resource assessments, 
* developing interpretive strategies,
* providing sufficient background information to assist in making informed decisions regarding UCH resources. 
The workshop is certified by the [http://rpanet.org/? Register of Professional Archaeologists] and RPA members receive continuing professional education credit.

== Awards ==
The ACUA awards the competitive [[George R. Fischer|George Fischer]] [https://acuaonline.org/about-the-acua/awards/ Student Travel Award] annually to provide $1,000.00 (USD) in travel support for an international maritime archaeology student to attend and present at the annual Society for Historical and Underwater Archaeology conference.The aware is named after [[George R. Fischer|George Fischer]], a founding and emeritus member of the ACUA. The award helps to advance board's goal to support the professional development of students embarking on their nascent careers; which furthers the overall mission of the ACUA to foster the growth and development of underwater and maritime archaeology around the globe. Since the inaugural award in 2012, students hailing from the West Indies, Argentina, United Kingdom, and Australia have benefited from the support to participate in the exchange of ideas at the annual conference.

== Meetings ==
The ACUA meets regularly as part of the annual SHA Conference on Historical and Underwater Archaeology.

== Leadership ==
The ACUA is composed of twelve individuals&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://acuaonline.org/about-the-acua/who-we-are/|title=» Who We Are|website=acuaonline.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; elected on a rotating basis for four-year terms by the membership of the Society for Historical Archaeology. The members include professionals from state and federal archaeology programs, museums, non-profit institutes, cultural resource management firms, universities, conservation laboratories, and avocational societies involved in underwater archaeology. Members hail from Europe, Canada, Australia, Mexico, South America, the Caribbean, and the United States. The board elects officers for three year terms. All board terms expire at the ACUA business meeting in January.

In addition to regularly elected members, the ACUA has Associate Members who provide their insights and expertise on technical issues, education, sport diver training, shipwreck preserves and management, and international issues. The associate members may be individuals who are invited because of their particular expertise, or institutions who are invited because of their long and outstanding contributions to the field of underwater archaeology.

Graduate Student Associates extend the council’s outreach to and input from the small but active community of students, who are the future of the field. All associate terms are two years.

[[File:AGOW.jpg|thumb|153x153px|Dr. Andrew Gow, scholar of Medieval and Early Modern Europe, apocalypticism, and witchcraft.]]
'''Andrew Colin Gow''' is a Canadian historian of medieval and early modern Europe and a noted scholar of early modern witchcraft. He completed his Ph.D with the Reformation scholar [[Heiko Oberman]]. Gow is Professor of History at the [[University of Alberta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Gow, Andrew - University of Alberta|url = https://www.ualberta.ca/arts/about/people-collection/andrew-gow}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also serves as Editor-in-Chief of [[Brill Publishers]]' series ''Studies in Medieval and Reformation Traditions.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brill.com/publications/studies-medieval-and-reformation-traditions|title=Studies in Medieval and Reformation Traditions|work=brill.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gow has supervised over two dozen M.A. and Ph.D students.

==Early work==

Gow's early work focused on the [[Red Jews]] and the German tales of the apocalyptic threat they supposedly presented. His first book ''The Red Jews: Antisemitism in an Apocalyptic Age, 1200-1600'' was published in 1995 by Brill.

==Witches in early modern Europe==

His later published work focused on early modern witchcraft. Gow co-wrote ''Male witches in early modern Europe'' with Lara Apps. This book critiques historians' assumptions about gender in early modern witch hunts.

==Johannes Tinctor ==

Most recently Gow and his research team have been studying and translating an early modern treatise on witch hunting by Johannes Tinctor, ''Invectives Against the Sect of Waldensians''. This book discusses the origin of many of our contemporary ideas about witchcraft, including flying on brooms and casting spells. This project was featured in an episode of CBC Radio's [[Ideas (radio show)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/radio/ideas/tinctor-s-foul-manual-1.2913889|title=Tinctor's Foul Manual|date=24 April 2014|work=cbc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newspaper articles were written on this project including in the [[Toronto Star]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2012/11/22/university_of_alberta_proud_owner_of_rare_book_on_fighting_witchcraft.html|title=University of Alberta proud owner of rare book on fighting witchcraft|date=22 November 2012|work=thestar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Edmonton Journal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/the-witch-burners-mein-kampf-excerpts-of-evil|title=The Witch-Burner's Mein Kampf: Excerpts of evil - Edmonton Journal|authors =Paula Simons, Edmonton Journal More Paula Simons, Edmonton Journal|work=Edmonton Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gow and his co-researchers have translated and edited a volume titled ''The Arras Witch Treatises: Johann Tinctor's Invectives contre la secte de vauderie and the Recollectio casus, status et condicionis Valdensium'' ''ydolatrarum'' ''by the Anonymous of Arras (1460),'' co-introduced, co-edited and co-translated with Robert Desjardins and François Pageau, which was published in 2016 by Penn State University Press in the series 'Magic in History'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Magic in History|url = http://www.psupress.org/books/series/book_SeriesMagic.html|website = www.psupress.org|accessdate = 2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Work==

Gow has published in many historical fields. He has written on the history of cartography, German vernacular bibles and the Apocalypse.&lt;ref name="Gow Publications"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cloudfront.ualberta.ca/-/media/arts/people/agow/acgcv17-1.doc|title=Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also co-edited a collection of writing about the Rocky Mountains: ''Mountain Masculinity: The Life and Writing of Nello "Tex" Vernon-Wood in the Canadian Rockies, 1906-1938.''

{{Marxism–Leninism sidebar|expanded=concepts}}
'''Anti-revisionism''' is a position within [[Marxism–Leninism]] which emerged in the 1950s in opposition to the reforms of [[Soviet leader]] [[Nikita Khrushchev]]. Where Khrushchev pursued an interpretation of [[Leninism]] that differed from his predecessor [[Joseph Stalin]], the anti-revisionists within the international communist movement remained dedicated to Stalin's ideological legacy and criticized the [[Soviet Union]] under Khrushchev and his successors as [[state capitalism|state capitalist]] and [[social imperialism|social imperialist]] due largely to its hopes of achieving peace with the [[United States]]. The term "[[Stalinism]]" is also used to describe these positions, but it is often not used by its supporters.

==Overview==
Marxism–Leninism is a political ideology based on the theories of [[Karl Marx]], [[Friedrich Engels]] and [[Vladimir Lenin]]. It holds that [[capitalism]] divides humans into two classes – the [[bourgeoisie]] or property-owning class, and the [[proletariat]] or labouring class. On top of this, it claims the proletariat is divided into a [[labour aristocracy]] of powerful [[imperialism|imperialist]] nations which is granted some economic and political power, and the superexploited [[colonialism|colonial]] or [[neo-colonialism|neo-colonial]] proletariat. Marxist–Leninists advocate the most [[class consciousness|class conscious]] members of the proletariat form [[vanguard party|vanguard parties]] based around the principle of [[democratic centralism]] which will lead revolutionary movements towards the creation of single-party states which will gradually progress to [[socialism]] and finally global [[communism]].

Anti-revisionism is a position within Marxism–Leninism based on its interpretation by Joseph Stalin, also called Stalinism. Stalin advocated strict totalitarian rule by vanguard parties, drastic and fast-paced economic transformation in the short-term, and violent confrontation with capitalist powers. The emergence of the [[Khrushchevism|Khrushchevist]] interpretation lead to a reaction from pro-Stalin Marxist–Leninists, who formed the anti-revisionist movement. Anti-revisionists rejected the Soviet Union's leadership of the Marxist–Leninist movement, believing it had become state capitalist and social imperialist. Despite this, the lines between the two camps in Marxism–Leninism were often blurry. The [[Workers' Party of Korea|Korean Workers' Party]], for instance, was pro-Soviet, but also defended Stalin's legacy and was engaged in violent struggle against the capitalist [[South Korea]] and its American backers. Due to this, the global anti-revisionist movement tended to support it and continues to do so to this day despite its ideological departure from Marxism–Leninism. The [[Communist Party of Cuba|Cuban Communist Party]] and [[Communist Party of Vietnam|Vietnamese Communist Party]] also received critical support from many anti-revisionists despite being pro-Soviet, due to their violent struggles against the US. The Cuban Communists also provided material support to the American anti-revisionist [[Black Panther Party]].

The [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] is officially anti-revisionist; however, most anti-revisionists followed the example of the [[Party of Labour of Albania|Albanian Labour Party]] in denouncing it as revisionist following the beginning of market-based and pro-American reforms in the 1970s. The term "[[Dengism]]" is often used to describe this perceived revisionist tendency in Marxism–Leninism, despite official claims that it is an adaptation of Marxism–Leninism to contemporary Chinese material conditions, rather than a revision.

Despite agreeing that he had a revisionist turn later in his life, most contemporary anti-revisionists hold particular interest in the theories of Chinese leader [[Mao Zedong]]. Mao, amongst other things, claimed that socialist movements in the neo-colonial world could temporarily ally with the [[nationalism|nationalist]] movements of the local [[petite bourgeoisie]], and that the implementation of a "[[mass line]]" policy will prevent a vanguard from becoming revisionist. Departing from anti-revisionist Marxism–Leninism, many today instead believe in a separate ideology known as [[Marxism–Leninism–Maoism]], which views the early theories of Mao as a higher stage of Leninist ideology, just as Leninism is a higher stage of Marxism. Among both Marxist–Leninist–Maoists and anti-revisionist Marxist–Leninists with a tendency towards Mao's theories exists the [[Maoism (Third Worldism)|Maoist (Third Worldist)]] tendency which claims the labour aristocracy has no immediate revolutionary potential, and may also claim it experiences no exploitation at all.

==History==
[[Image:Antirevisionist cartoon.jpg|thumb|200px|Αnti-revisionist caricature of 1976 by Albanian cartoonist Zef Bumçi depicting Nikita Khrushchev as a servant of the bourgeoisie]]
Self-proclaimed anti-revisionists firmly oppose the reforms initiated in [[communist state|Communist countries]] by leaders like [[Nikita Khrushchev]] in the Soviet Union and [[Deng Xiaoping]] in China. They generally refer to such reforms and states as [[State capitalism#Use by Maoists and anti-revisionists|state capitalist]] and [[Social imperialism|social imperialist]]. They also reject [[Trotskyism]] and its "[[Permanent revolution|Permanent Revolution]]" as "[[hypocritical]]" by arguing that [[Leon Trotsky]] had at one time thought it acceptable that socialism could work in a single country as long as that country was [[industrialized]], but that Trotsky had considered Russia too backward to achieve such industrialization&amp;nbsp;– what it later in fact did achieve, mostly through his archenemy [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Five Year Plan (USSR)|Five Year Plans]].

In their own right, anti-revisionists also acknowledge that the [[Soviet Union]] contained a "[[new class]]" or "'red' bourgeoisie", but they generally place the blame for the formation of that class on Khrushchev and his successors, and not on Stalin. Therefore, in anti-revisionist circles, there is very little talk of [[class conflict]] in the Soviet Union before 1956, except when talking about specific contexts such as the [[Russian Civil War]] (when some agents of the former feudal ruling class tried to retake [[Power (social and political)|state power]] from the [[Bolshevik]]s) and [[World War II]] (fought principally between communists and fascists, representing the interests of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie respectively).

During the [[Sino-Soviet split]], the governments of the [[People's Republic of China]] under [[Mao Zedong]] and the [[People's Republic of Albania]] under [[Enver Hoxha]] proclaimed themselves to be taking an anti-revisionist line and denounced Khrushchev's policies in the Soviet Union. In the [[United States]], those who supported China or Albania at the time were expelled from the [[Communist Party USA|United States Communist Party]] under orders from Moscow, and in 1961 they formed the [[Progressive Labor Movement]] and other "[[new communist movement]]" communist parties. A short time later, anti-revisionist groups were further divided by the [[Sino-Albanian split]], with those following Albania being loosely described as [[Hoxhaism|Hoxhaist]].

On the whole, the original 1960s-era anti-revisionists tended to take a careful, selective approach to the [[Cuban Revolution]] and the way it soon aligned itself with Soviet ideas and practice, criticizing the latter action, while simultaneously acknowledging some aspects of Cuban self-described socialism as genuinely revolutionary—in particular the writing and thinking of [[Che Guevara]]. Anti-revisionists also took a hopeful approach towards [[Viet Cong|the Vietnamese communists]], expressing confidence that they too were genuinely revolutionary-communist in their aspirations, and supported their struggle against the United States in the [[Vietnam War]]—a side which got a lot of support from the Soviet Union, anti-revisionists' "[[state capitalist]]" enemy.

Several present-day [[communist party|communist parties]] worldwide still see themselves as explicitly anti-revisionist, but not every such party adhering to elements of anti-revisionism necessarily adopts the label "anti-revisionist". Many such organizations may call themselves [[Maoist]], [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] or even just simply "revolutionary communist".

The [[Workers Party of Korea]] still claims an anti-revisionist political line, but the communist movement as a whole and anti-revisionists from the Maoist and Hoxhaist camps in particular tend to insist [[North Korea]] is a revisionist state. However, many if not most Hoxhaists and Maoists are critically supportive of North Korea on grounds of Anti-imperialism.

Anti-revisionists aligned with Enver Hoxha and the line of the Albanian party of labor argue that "[[Mao Zedong thought]]" is itself a form of revisionism. Hoxhaists insist that Mao's [[Three Worlds Theory]] contradicted [[Marxism–Leninism]] and existed only to justify Mao's alliance with the United States that began in the early 1970s and his meeting with Nixon during the [[Sino-Soviet split]] that Enver Hoxha and the Hoxhaists opposed. Hoxhaists also argue that the theory of [[New Democracy]] and [[People's War]] were revisionist and anti-scientific. The Hoxhaist camp came into existence during the Sino-Albanian split.

An '''archive''' is an accumulation of [[Historical document|historical records]] or the physical place they are located.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usd.edu/library/instruction/glossary.shtml#a |title=Glossary of Library and Internet Terms |accessdate=30 April 2007 |publisher=University of South Dakota Library|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310132820/http://www.usd.edu/library/instruction/glossary.shtml#a|archivedate=2009-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archives contain [[primary source]] documents that have accumulated over the course of an individual or organization's lifetime, and are kept to show the function of that person or organization. Professional [[archivist]]s and historians generally understand archives to be records that have been naturally and necessarily generated as a product of regular legal, commercial, administrative, or social activities. They have been metaphorically defined as "the secretions of an organism",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=V.H. |last=Galbraith |authorlink=Vivian Hunter Galbraith |title=Studies in the Public Records |place=London |year=1948 |page=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and are distinguished from documents that have been consciously written or created to communicate a particular message to posterity. &lt;!--removed from another section where it was irrelevant; may wish to be incorporated: The word ''archive'' can refer to any organised body of records fixed on media. The management of archives is essential for effective day-to-day organisational decision making, and even for the survival of organisations.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}--&gt;

In general, archives consist of records that have been selected for permanent or long-term preservation on grounds of their enduring cultural, historical, or evidentiary value. Archival records are normally unpublished and almost always unique, unlike books or magazines for which many identical copies exist. This means that archives are quite distinct from libraries with regard to their functions and organization, although archival collections can often be found within library buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/a/archives|title=A Glossary of Archival and Records Terminology|accessdate=7 December 2012|publisher=Society of American Archivists|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615035638/http://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/a/archives|archivedate=15 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A person who works in archives is called an [[archivist]]. The study and practice of organizing, preserving, and providing access to information and materials in archives is called [[archival science]]. The physical place of storage can be referred to as an archive (more usual in the [[United Kingdom]]), an archives (more usual in the [[United States]]), or a repository.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glossary of Archival and Records Terminology|url=http://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/a/archives|publisher=Society of American Archivists|accessdate=2013-10-21|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022034302/http://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/a/archives|archivedate=22 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When referring to historical records or the places they are kept, the plural form ''archives'' is chiefly used.&lt;ref&gt;"archive" ''The Oxford English Dictionary''. 2nd ed. 1989. [[OED Online]]. [[Oxford University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; The computing use of the term 'archive' should not be confused with the record-keeping meaning of the term.

==Etymology==
First attested in English in early 17th century, the word ''archive'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑr|k|aɪ|v}} is derived from the French ''archives'' (plural), in turn from [[Latin]] ''archīum'' or ''archīvum'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Darchium archīum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924185602/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Darchium |date=24 September 2015 }}, Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, ''A Latin Dictionary'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; which is the [[romanization|romanized]] form of the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''ἀρχεῖον'' (''archeion''), "[[public records]], [[town-hall]], residence, or office of chief [[magistrate]]s",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29rxei%3Don ἀρχεῖον] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009174332/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=a)rxei=on |date=9 October 2012 }}, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; itself from ''ἀρχή'' (''arkhē''), amongst others "magistracy, office, government"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29rxh%2F ἀρχή] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606125340/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=a)rxh%2F |date=6 June 2011 }}, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; (compare an-archy, mon-archy), which comes from the verb ''ἄρχω'' (''arkhō''), "to begin, rule, govern".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29%2Frxw ἄρχω] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618065951/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29%2Frxw |date=18 June 2013 }}, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;

The word originally developed from the Greek ''{{lang|grc|ἀρχεῖον}}'' (arkheion), which refers to the home or dwelling of the [[Archon]], in which important official state documents were filed and interpreted under the authority of the Archon. The adjective formed from ''archive'' is ''archival''.

==History==
The practice of keeping official documents is very old. Archaeologists have discovered archives of hundreds (and sometime thousands) of clay tablets going back to the third and second millennia BC in sites like [[Ebla]], [[Mari, Syria|Mari]], [[Amarna]], [[Hattusas]], [[Ugarit]], and [[Pylos]]. These discoveries have been fundamental to know ancient alphabets, languages, literature, and politics.

Archives were well developed by the ancient Chinese, the ancient Greeks, and ancient Romans (who called them ''[[Tabularium|Tabularia]]''). However, they have been lost, since documents written on materials like [[papyrus]] and paper deteriorated at a faster pace, unlike their stone tablet counterparts. Archives of churches, kingdoms, and cities from the Middle Ages survive and have often kept their official status uninterruptedly until now. They are the basic tool for historical research on these ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Stuart|title=The Library: An Illustrated History|date=2009|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing|location=New York|isbn=978-1-61608-453-0|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern archival thinking has many roots from the French Revolution. The [[French National Archives]], who possess perhaps the largest archival collection in the world, with records going as far back as 625 A.D., were created in 1790 during the [[French Revolution]] from various government, religious, and private archives seized by the revolutionaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/archive |title=archive: Definition, Synonyms from |publisher=Answers.com |accessdate=1 June 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100523111412/http://www.answers.com/topic/archive |archivedate=23 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Users and institutions==
[[File:Staatsarchiv Erdberg Sep 2006 002.jpg|thumb|right|Reading room of the [[:de:Österreichisches Staatsarchiv|Österreichisches Staatsarchiv]] (Austrian State Archive), in the Erdberg district of Vienna (2006)]]
Historians, [[genealogist]]s, lawyers, [[demographer]]s, filmmakers, and others conduct research at archives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/archives/about/what-are-archives |title=What Are Archives? |accessdate=2 September 2014 |publisher=[[National Museum of American History]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140905072959/http://americanhistory.si.edu/archives/about/what-are-archives |archivedate=5 September 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The research process at each archive is unique, and depends upon the institution that houses the archive.  While there are many kinds of archives, the most recent census of archivists in the United States identifies five major types: academic, business (for profit), government, non-profit, and other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Walch |first=Victoria Irons |year=2006 |title=Archival Census and Education Needs Survey in the United States: Part 1: Introduction |journal=The American Archivist |volume=69 |issue=2 |pages=294–309 |url=http://www.archivists.org/a-census/reports/Walch-ACENSUS.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=30 April 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314203430/http://www.archivists.org/a-census/reports/Walch-ACENSUS.pdf |archivedate=14 March 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also four main areas of inquiry involved with archives: material technologies, organizing principles, geographic locations, and tangled embodiments of humans and non-humans.  These areas help to further categorize what kind of archive is being created.

===Academic===
{{see also|Institutional repository}}
[[File:Charles Sturt University Regional Archives 1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Charles Sturt University]] Regional Archives.]]
Archives in colleges, universities, and other educational facilities are typically housed within a library, and duties may be carried out by an [[archivist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=William J. |last=Maher |year=1992 |title=The Management of College and University Archives |oclc=25630256 |location=Metuchen, New Jersey |publisher=[[Society of American Archivists]] and [[The Scarecrow Press]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2014}}  Academic archives exist to preserve institutional history and serve the academic community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.kennesaw.edu/archives/| title= Welcome to University Archives and Records Management| accessdate= 8 May 2007| publisher= Kennesaw State University Archives| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070414165623/http://www.kennesaw.edu/archives/| archivedate= 14 April 2007| deadurl= yes| df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; An academic archive may contain materials such as the institution's administrative records, personal and professional papers of former professors and presidents, memorabilia related to school organizations and activities, and items the academic library wishes to remain in a closed-stack setting, such as rare books or [[thesis]] copies. Access to the collections in these archives is usually by prior appointment only; some have posted hours for making inquiries.  Users of academic archives can be undergraduates, graduate students, faculty and staff, scholarly researchers, and the general public.  Many academic archives work closely with [[alumni]] relations departments or other campus institutions to help raise funds for their library or school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.archivists.org/groups/college-and-university-archives-section/guidelines-for-college-and-university-archives |title=Guidelines for College and University Archives |accessdate=2 September 2014 |publisher=[[Society of American Archivists]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140905030415/http://www2.archivists.org/groups/college-and-university-archives-section/guidelines-for-college-and-university-archives |archivedate=5 September 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Qualifications for employment may vary.  Entry-level positions usually require an undergraduate diploma, but typically archivists hold graduate degrees in history or library science (preferably certified by a body such as the [[American Library Association]]).&lt;ref name=Riggs&gt;Michelle Riggs, "The Correlation of Archival Education and Job Requirements Since the Advent of Encoded Archival Description," Journal of Archival Organization 3, no. 1 (January 2005): 61-79. (accessed 23 July 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Subject-area specialization becomes more common in higher ranking positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=So You Want to Be an Archivist: An Overview of the Archives Profession |url=http://www2.archivists.org/profession |website=Society of American Archivists |accessdate=23 July 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140711152538/http://www2.archivists.org/profession |archivedate=11 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business (for profit)===
Archives located in for-profit institutions are usually those owned by a private business.  Examples of prominent business archives in the United States include [[Coca-Cola]] (which also owns the separate museum [[World of Coca-Cola]]), [[Procter and Gamble]], [[Motorola]] Heritage Services and Archives, and [[Levi Strauss &amp; Co.]]  These corporate archives maintain historic documents and items related to the history and administration of their companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessarchivescouncil.org.uk/|title=Business Archives Council |accessdate=8 May 2007 |publisher=businessarchivescouncil.org.uk| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070606151253/http://www.businessarchivescouncil.org.uk/| archivedate= 6 June 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Business archives serve the purpose of helping their corporations maintain control over their brand by retaining memories of the company's past.  Especially in business archives, [[records management]] is separate from the historic aspect of archives.  Workers in these types of archives may have any combination of training and degrees, from either a history or library background.  These archives are typically not open to the public and only used by workers of the owner company, though some allow approved visitors by appointment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hunterinformation.com/corporat.htm|title=Directory of Corporate Archives |accessdate=8 May 2007 |publisher=hunterinformation.com| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070405071910/http://www.hunterinformation.com/corporat.htm| archivedate= 5 April 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Business archives are concerned with maintaining the [[integrity]] of their company, and are therefore selective of how their materials may be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.archivists.org/saagroups/bas/Intro_bus_arch.asp |title= Business Archives in North America – Invest in your future: Understand your past |accessdate=8 May 2007 |publisher=Society of American Archivists|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061001211352/http://www.archivists.org/saagroups/bas/Intro_bus_arch.asp |archivedate = 1 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government===
{{main|National archives}}
[[File:WikiXDC National Archives Tour Hall - Stierch.jpg|thumb|right|Storage facility at the [[National Archives and Records Administration]], Washington, D.C.]]
Government archives include those maintained by local and state government as well as those maintained by the national (or federal) government. Anyone may use a government archive, and frequent users include [[reporters]], [[genealogists]], writers, [[historians]], students, and people seeking information on the history of their home or region. Many government archives are open to the public and no appointment is required to visit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.ca/about-us/016/index-e.html |title=Directions for Change |deadurl=yes |accessdate=27 October 2016 |publisher=collectionscanada.ca |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070227022316/http://www.collectionscanada.ca/about-us/016/index-e.html |archivedate=27 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, [[National Archives and Records Administration]] (NARA) maintains central archival facilities in the [[District of Columbia]] and [[College Park, Maryland]], with regional facilities distributed throughout the United States. Some city or local governments may have repositories, but their organization and accessibility varies widely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cyndislist.com/us/state-level-records-repositories |title=Cyndi's List - United States - U.S. State Level Records Repositories |accessdate=2 September 2014 |publisher=[[Cyndi's List of Genealogy Sites on the Internet]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar to the library profession, certification requirements and education also varies widely, from state to state.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, Christine.

In the UK, the [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|National Archives]] (formerly known as the Public Record Office) is the government archive for England and [[Wales]]. The [[English Heritage Archive]] is the public archive of [[English Heritage]]. The [[National Archives of Scotland]], located in [[Edinburgh]], serve that country while the [[Public Record Office of Northern Ireland]] in [[Belfast]] is the government archive for Northern Ireland.

A network of [[county record office]]s and other local authority-run archives exists throughout England, Wales, and Scotland and holds many important collections, including local government, landed estates, church, and business records. Many archives have contributed catalogues to the national "[[Access to Archives]]" programme and online searching across collections is possible.

In France, the French Archives Administration (''Service interministériel des Archives de France'') in the [[Minister of Culture (France)|Ministry of Culture]] manages the [[Archives nationales (France)|National Archives]] (''Archives nationales''), which possess 406&amp;nbsp;km. (252 miles) of archives {{as of|2010|lc=y}} (the total length of occupied shelves put next to each other), with original records going as far back as A.D. 625, as well as the departmental archives (''archives départementales''), located in the ''[[Prefectures in France|préfectures]]'' of each of the 100 ''[[departments of France|départements]]'' of France, which possess 2,297&amp;nbsp;km. (1,427 miles) of archives ({{as of|2010|lc=y}}), and also the local city archives, about 600 in total, which possess 456&amp;nbsp;km. (283,4 miles) of archives ({{as of|2010|lc=y}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{fr_icon}} ''Chiffres clés 2011. Statistiques de la Culture'', Paris, La Documentation française, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Put together, the total volume of archives under the supervision of the French Archives Administration is the largest in the world.

In [[India]], the [[National Archives of India|National Archives]] (NAI) are located in New Delhi.

In [[Taiwan]], the National Archives Administration are located in [[Taipei]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov.tw/English |title=National Archives Administration |website=National Development Council of Taiwan |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917052616/http://www.archives.gov.tw/english/ |archivedate=17 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most intergovernmental organisations keep their own historical archives. However, a number of European organisations, including the European Commission, choose to deposit their archives with the European University Institute in Florence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Archives|url=http://www.eui.eu/Research/HistoricalArchivesOfEU/AbouttheHistoricalArchives/Index.aspx|website=European University Institute|accessdate=23 July 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706220937/http://www.eui.eu/Research/HistoricalArchivesOfEU/AbouttheHistoricalArchives/Index.aspx|archivedate=6 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Archdiocese]]s, [[diocese]]s, and parishes also have archives in the Roman Catholic and [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] Churches. Very important are [[monastery]] archives, because of their antiquity, like the ones of [[Monte Cassino]], [[Abbey of Saint Gall|Saint Gall]], and [[Fulda monastery|Fulda]]. The records in these archives include manuscripts, papal records, local Church records, photographs, oral histories, audiovisual materials, and architectural drawings.

Most Protestant denominations have archives as well, including the Presbyterian U.S.A Historical Society,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Presbyterian Historical Society|url=http://history.pcusa.org/|accessdate=31 March 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110426023226/http://history.pcusa.org/| archivedate= 26 April 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Moravian Church Archives,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moravianchurcharchives.org/|title=Moravian Archives|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329122545/http://www.moravianchurcharchives.org/|archivedate=29 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Southern Baptist Historical Library and Archives,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Southern Baptist Historical Library and Archives|url=http://www.sbhla.org/|accessdate=31 March 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110330061539/http://www.sbhla.org/| archivedate= 30 March 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; the United Methodist Archives and History Center of the United Methodist Church,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Methodist Archives Center|url=http://www.gcah.org|accessdate=31 March 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080828054648/http://gcah.org/| archivedate=28 August 2008&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Disciples of Christ Historical Society|url=http://discipleshistory.org/|accessdate=2 August 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110725235550/http://www.discipleshistory.org/| archivedate= 25 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-profit===
Non-profit archives include those in [[List of Historical Societies|historical societies]], not-for-profit businesses such as hospitals, and the repositories within [[Foundation (charity)|foundations]].  Non-profit archives are typically set up with private funds from donors to preserve the papers and history of specific persons or places.  Often these institutions rely on [[Grant (money)|grant]] funding from the government as well as the private funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Dorothy Weyer |last=Creigh |first2=Laurence R. |last2=Pizer | year=1991 | title=A Primer for Local Historical Societies |edition=2nd |page=122 |publisher=[[American Association for State and Local History]] |isbn=9780942063127 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Depending on the funds available, non-profit archives may be as small as the historical society in a rural town to as big as a state historical society that rivals a government archives. Users of this type of archive may vary as much as the institutions that hold them.  Employees of non-profit archives may be professional archivists, para-professionals, or volunteers, as the education required for a position at a non-profit archive varies with the demands of the collection's user base.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first=Walter Muir | last=Whitehill | year=1962 | title=Independent Historical Societies: An Enquiry into Their Research and Publication Functions and Their Financial Future  | chapter=Introduction | editor= | others= | page=311 | location=Boston, Massachusetts | publisher=The Boston Athenaeum | id= | url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Web archiving===
{{main|Web archive}}
Web archiving is the process of collecting portions of the [[World Wide Web]] and ensuring the collection is [[digital preservation|preserved]] in an archive, such as an [[archive site]], for future researchers, historians, and the public.  Due to the massive size of the Web, web archivists typically employ [[web crawler]]s for automated collection.

Similarly, software code and documentation can be archived on the web, as with the example of [[CPAN]].

===Other===
Some archives defy categorization.  There are tribal archives within the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] nations in North America, and there are archives that exist within the papers of private individuals.  Many museums keep archives in order to prove the [[provenance]] of their pieces.  Any institution or persons wishing to keep their significant papers in an organized fashion that employs the most basic principles of [[archival science]] may have an archive.  In the 2004 census of archivists taken in the United States, 2.7% of archivists were employed in institutions that defied categorization.  This was a separate figure from the 1.3% that identified themselves as self-employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walch |first=Victoria Irons |year=2006 |title=A*Census: A Closer Look|journal=The American Archivist |volume=69 |issue= 2|pages=327–348|url=http://www.archivists.org/a-census| accessdate=8 May 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070405071939/http://www.archivists.org/a-census| archivedate= 5 April 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another type of archive is the Public Secrets project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publicsecret.net/|title=Public Secrets|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is an interactive testimonial, in which women incarcerated in the California State Prison System describe what happened to them. The archive's mission is to gather stories from women who want to express themselves, and want their stories heard. This collection includes transcripts and an audio recording of the women telling their stories.

The archives of an individual may include letters, papers, photographs, computer files, scrapbooks, financial records, or diaries created or collected by the individual – regardless of media or format. The archives of an organization (such as a corporation or government) tend to contain other types of records, such as administrative files, business records, memos, official correspondence, and meeting minutes.

==Standardization==
The [[International Council on Archives]] (ICA) has developed a number of standards on archival description including the General International Standard Archival Description ISAD(G).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ica.org/10206/standards/standards-list.html|title=ICA Standards Page|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140824102817/http://www.ica.org/10206/standards/standards-list.html|archivedate=24 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ISAD(G) is meant to be used in conjunction with national standards or as a basis for nations to build their own standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ica.org/en/node/30000 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818015843/http://www.ica.org/en/node/30000 |date=18 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, ISAD(G) is implemented through [[Describing Archives: A Content Standard]], popularly known as "DACS".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Describing Archives: A Content Standard|url=http://www.archivists.org/governance/standards/dacs.asp|publisher=Society of American Archivists|accessdate=20 August 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100714055311/http://www.archivists.org/governance/standards/dacs.asp|archivedate=14 July 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, ISAD(G) is implemented through the Council of Archives&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cdncouncilarchives.ca/Canadian{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; as the [[Rules for Archival Description]], also known as "RAD".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rules for Archival Description|year=1990|publisher=Bureau of Canadian Archivists|isbn=978-0-9690797-3-6|url=http://www.cdncouncilarchives.ca/archdesrules.html|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170516200843/http://www.cdncouncilarchives.ca/archdesrules.html|archivedate=16 May 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Marxism|economics}}

The theory of the '''Asiatic mode of production''' ('''AMP''') was devised by [[Karl Marx]]  around the early 1850s. The essence of the theory has been described as "[the] suggestion ... that Asiatic societies were held in thrall by a despotic ruling clique, residing in central cities and directly expropriating surplus from largely [[autarky|autarkic]] and generally undifferentiated village communities".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

| location = Berkeley | publisher = University of California Press | year = 1997
| isbn = 978-0-520-20743-1 | page = 94 | postscript = .
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory continues to arouse heated discussion among contemporary Marxists and non-Marxists alike.  Some have rejected the whole concept on the grounds that the socio-economic formations of pre-capitalist Asia did not differ enough from those of feudal Europe to warrant special designation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Aside from Marx, [[Friedrich Engels]] was also an enthusiastic commentator on the AMP.  They both focused on the socio-economic base of AMP society.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Principles==
Marx's theory focuses on the organization of labour and depends on his distinction between the following:

*The means or forces of production; items such as land, natural resources, tools, human skills and knowledge, that are required for the production of socially useful goods; and
*The relations of production, which are the social relationships formed as human beings are united ("verbindung") in the processes of the production of socially useful goods.

Together these compose [[modes of production]] and Marx distinguished historical eras in terms of distinct predominant modes of production (Asiatic).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

| title = Marx &amp; Engels Selected Works | volume = 3
| publisher = Progress Publishers | location = Moscow | pages = 13–30
| postscript = .
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Marx and Engels highlighted and emphasised that the role the state played in Asiatic societies was dominant, which was accounted for by either the state's monopoly of land ownership, its sheer political and military power, or its control over irrigation systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Marx and Engels attributed this state domination to the communal nature of landholding and the isolation of the inhabitants of different villages from one another.

==Criticism==
The Asiatic mode of production is a notion that has been the subject of much discussion by both Marxist and non-Marxist commentators.   The AMP is the most disputed mode of production outlined in the works of Marx and Engels.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

| isbn = 978-0-7100-8168-1
| postscript = .
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Questions regarding the validity of the concept of the AMP were raised in terms of whether or not it corresponds to the reality of certain given societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

| doi = 10.2307/279985
| pages = 43–61 | postscript = . | jstor = 279985
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Historians have questioned the value of the notion of the AMP as an interpretation of the "facts" of Indian or Chinese history.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

| doi = 10.1525/aa.1977.79.1.02a00030
}}, p.38.&lt;/ref&gt;

The acceptance of the AMP concept has varied with changes in the political environment.  The theory was rejected in the Soviet Union in the Stalinist period. [[Karl August Wittfogel]] suggested in his 1957 book,  ''[[Oriental Despotism (book)|Oriental Despotism]]'', that his concept of [[Oriental despotism]] showed that this was because of the similarity between the AMP and the reality of Stalin's Russia, he saw the authoritarian nature of communism as an extension of the need of totalitarian rule to control water in "the Orient".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Wittfogel|first=Karl|title=Oriental Despotism; A Comparative Study of Total Power|volume=|pages=|year=1957|postscript=.|location=New Haven|publisher=Yale University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12415">'''Chinese crime fiction''' (Chinese: 犯罪小说, [[pinyin]]: ''fànzuì xiǎoshuō'') is an umbrella term which generally refers to [[Sinophone]] literature concerned with the investigation and punishment of criminal acts. In mainland China the most popular subgenre is "detective fiction" (Chinese: 侦探推理小说， pinyin: ''zhēntàn tuīlǐ xiǎoshuō'', literally ''detective deduction stories'', often abbreviated to 推理小说 tuīlǐ xiǎoshuō or 侦探小说 zhēntàn xiǎoshuō).

== Origins and Brief Timeline ==
In the 1950s, crime fiction was dominated by "legal system literature", which included legal system poetry, crime reportage, and works about civil conflicts. The 1980s saw the rise of the less progressive-sounding public security literature, which marked a shift from the ancient and respected "court case literature."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Kinkley, Jeffrey C. ''Chinese justice, the fiction: Law and literature in modern China''. Stanford University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1896, Sherlock Holmes was translated into Chinese.  During the 1890s-1920s, European-style detective fiction was popular in China.

Between 1949 and 1977, no work of fiction told of crimes committed by the gentry.  Crimes were also not reported by the press as the socialist system was not supposed to foster crime. Sherlockian novels were then characterized as capitalist and low grade, arguing they aroused base passions for sex and violence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Mainland China==

===Crime Fiction in the Song and Ming Dynasties===
{{main|Gong'an fiction}}
During the [[Song dynasty|Song]] and [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] dynasties, crime fictions varied in themes. Gong'an (crime-case) fiction and swindler stories were considered the most popular subgenres. Written in colloquial rather than literary Chinese, they nearly always featured district magistrates or judges in the higher courts.

The gong'an genre was among the new types of vernacular fiction that developed from the Song to the Ming Dynasties. The plots usually begin with a description of the crime (often including realistic detail of contemporary life) and culminated in the exposure of the deed and the punishment of the guilty. Sometimes two solutions to a mystery were posited, but the correct solution is reached through a brilliant judge.

==== Song Dynasty (960–1279) ====
In the Song Dynasty the growth of commerce and urban society created a demand for a new kind of crime fiction–namely gong'an fiction that focused on entertaining the upper and merchant class. One of the most celebrated heroes of such tales was Judge [[Bao Zheng]], or "Dragon Plan Bao," who was originally based on a historical government official. Featured in hundreds of stories, Bao became the archetype of the incorruptible official in a society in which miscarriages of justice in favour of the rich and powerful were all too common. Not all crime stories have happy endings, and some were evidently written with the aim of exposing the brutal methods of corrupt judges who–after accepting bribes–would extract false confessions by torture and condemned innocent people to death. In some tales, the crimes are also exposed with the aid of supernatural forces.

==== Ming Dynasty (1368–1644) ====
In the Ming dynasty, the social influence of the merchant class steadily increased as a result of the development of capitalism. As a result of their change of social status, the merchant class demanded more literary entertainment, thus crime fiction featuring merchants as main characters thrived. These stories particularly focused on the way merchants handled money.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wenku.baidu.com/view/1b6a7ed55022aaea998f0fe6.html?from=search|title=The Change of Social Status Among Merchants in Ming Dynasty (明朝商人社会地位的变化)|last=|first=|date=11 January 2013|website=Baidu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the subgenres that developed during the time was swindler stories. Swindler stories focused on elaborate deception for monetary gain. The most famous swindler stories collection is ''The Book of Swindles'' by Zhang Yingyu finished in Late Ming. The book is composited with 24 sub-categories of swindles, which covered merely all kinds of deception in Ming society. Zhang wrote the book for a manual of self-protection as well as an expert guide to the art of deception.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang Yingyu (trans. Christopher Rea and Bruce Rusk): The Book of Swindles: Selections from a Late Ming Collection.(Translations from the Asian Classics.) xxxvi, 226 pp. New York: Columbia University Press, 2017. {{ISBN|978 0 231 17863 1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Translations and Original Crime Fiction During the Republican Era===
This was the Golden Age of the Chinese detective story. This era was flooded with translations of Western works as well as native Chinese series detectives.&lt;ref&gt;Kinkley, Jeffrey C. ''Chinese justice, the fiction: Law and literature in modern China''. Stanford University Press, 2000. {{ISBN|978-0804734431}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Short story writer Cheng Xiaoqing (程小青 ) was the most successful and prolific author of original Chinese crime fiction during the Republican Era in mainland China.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://u.osu.edu/mclc/book-reviews/sherlock-in-shanghai/|title=Sherlock in Shanghai: Stories of Crime and Detection by Cheng Xiaoqing Review|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His stories are noted for their similarity to the [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories by Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], with an selected stories being having been published by the [[University of Hawai'i Press]] under the title ''[[Sherlock in Shanghai]]'' in 2007, translated by [[Timothy C. Wong]].

Cheng Xiaoqing's contemporary, Sun Liaohong also created a series of Chinese detective novels which are said to have been modeled on the [[Arsène Lupin]] stories.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===In the People's Republic of China===
In the Mao era (1949–1977) of the People's Republic of China, literature involving detective or paranormal elements was banned, but many crime fiction novels written after this time were based within this time period. Stories of crime and detection were characterized as foreign to China.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The novel, ''[[Beijing Coma]]'' by [[Ma Jian (writer)|Ma Jian]], is banned due to mentions of the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square Protests of 1989]] and time travelling.

He Jiahong (何家弘) was born in 1953 and is a professor of criminal law at [[Renmin University of China|Renmin University]] and was the part-time Deputy Director of the Department of Dereliction of Duty and Infringement of Human Rights in the [[Supreme People's Procuratorate]] from 2006 to 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thechinastory.org/2012/09/he-jiahong-%E4%BD%95%E5%AE%B6%E5%BC%98-working-between-law-and-literature/|title=He Jiahong Working Between Law and Fiction|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[true crime]] novel ''Hanging Devils'' was published in English translation in 2012.

阿乙 , born in 1976, is a former police officer who writes darkly realistic crime fiction about migrant workers and the lower strata of mainland Chinese society.  His published works include ''Gray Stories'' (灰故事), ''Bird Saw Me'' (鸟看见我了), and ''Cat and Mouse'' (猫和老鼠).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://beijingbookworm.com/blf/meet-an-author-a-yi/|title=Meet an Author: A Yi|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in 1986, Sun Yisheng, who writes post-modern crime fiction under the pen name William Edward, is one of youngest crime writers to have been published in mainland China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wordswithoutborders.org/contributor/sun-yisheng|title=Sun Yisheng|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has had at least two short stories translated into English, the first in ''Chutzpah!'' magazine and the second, entitled ''The Shades who Periscope Through Flowers to the Sky'', in the online literary journal [[Words Without Borders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wordswithoutborders.org/article/the-shades-who-periscope-through-flowers-to-the-sky|title=The Shades who Periscope Through Flowers to the Sky|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crime  Fiction Featuring Chinese Language and Culture Published Outside Mainland China==

=== Hong Kong ===
In Hong Kong, literature writing has long been influenced by both the culture and social backgrounds from China and the Western world. Hence, its crime fiction has incorporated many distinguishing characteristics of all kinds of different crime literatures, depending on the political stance of the majority in Hong Kong and the specific era.

In the 1950s, many non-leftist writers decided to reside in Hong Kong to avoid the political stance of the newly established [[People's Republic of China|People’s Republic of China]]. The literature created at that time mainly focuses on anti-PRC, nostalgic and romantic topics. Crime fictions such as Immature, Obscene Society (半下流社会) written by Zhao Zifan (赵滋蕃) were created.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wenku.baidu.com/view/71fc384de518964bcf847c1b.html?from=search|title=香港文学（一）|last=|first=|date=22 August 2010|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Taiwan ===
The first Chinese fiction in Taiwan came out during the period of Japanese occupation, the Showa era in Japan. Before then, most of Chinese fiction was reprinted from Mainland China and it was difficult to find an author from Taiwan. However, this kind of situation has gradually improved since the Taiwan People News (臺灣民報) was first published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.6342/NTU.2010.02165|title=The Research on Taiwan’s Han-language Crime Fiction Under the Global Context (1895-1945)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Guitar Hero]]'' is a series of [[rhythm video game]]s published by [[Activision]] in which players use guitar-shaped [[game controller|controllers]] to mimic the playing of numerous popular [[rock music]] songs in a [[score attack]] gameplay; later games in the series have included support for both [[drums]] and vocals and playing as a full band. With over $2 billion in total sales worldwide, the game series has made a significant cultural impact, becoming a "cultural phenomenon" and recognizable in the popular culture.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/15/fashion/15guitar.html|title=Virtual Frets, Actual Sweat: The New Karaoke|work=[[The New York Times]]|last=Zezima|first=K.|date=2007-07-14|accessdate=2008-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2007/01/28/the-low-cost-of-guitar-heroism.html | title = The Low Cost of (Guitar) Heroism | first = Steven | last = Levy | publisher = ''[[Newsweek]]'' | date = 2007-01-29 | accessdate = 2007-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series has been found to influence younger players into learning real instruments, and has found application within the health care industry to help recovering patients.

Both ''Guitar Hero'' and ''[[Rock Band]]'' (a similar series of games developed by [[Harmonix]], who originally developed ''Guitar Hero''), have altered the video game and music industries. For video games, the introduction of ''Guitar Hero'' has led rhythm games to become one of the industries' largest growing markets. The series has also sparked the creation of both commercial and independently developed games with similar gameplay mechanics as well as learning tools using a real guitar in place of the controller. Older artists featured in ''Guitar Hero'' and ''Rock Band'' have experienced a surge in the popularity of their music, and the games have been seen as a way for younger audiences to experience the classic rock songs featured in the games. Newer bands and unsigned artists have also found success by being included in the game. This has led several bands to actively seek placement of their songs within the games. The impact of ''Guitar Hero'' on the music industry has caused music publishers to re-evaluate their approach to music licensing and their relationship with the video game industry.

==In entertainment==
The series' titles became very popular [[Party video game|party games]], which led them to be played in a variety of locales. In the wake of the series popularity several bars in the United States &amp; Canada began offering "''Guitar Hero'' nights" as an alternative to [[karaoke]];&lt;ref name="independent gh influence"/&gt; one [[New York City]] bar experienced triple the business on such nights.&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt; Many concert tours, including the [[Family Values Tour]] feature ''Guitar Hero'' booths and contests between sets.&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;  ''Guitar Hero'' is responsible for introducing people to rock music and inspiring them to learn how to play guitar.&lt;ref name="salon guitar hero"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ew gh vs rb"/&gt;  A study by [[Youth Music]] found that 2.5 million out of 12 million children in the United Kingdom have begun learning how to play real instruments after playing music video games such as ''Guitar Hero''; the group believes that these video games can be incorporated into music educational programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/features/can-gaming-save-the-record-industry-1192251.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090220142635/http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/features/can-gaming-save-the-record-industry-1192251.html | archivedate=2009-02-20| title = Can gaming save the record industry? | publisher = [[The Independent]] | date = 2008-12-17 | accessdate = 2008-12-17 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Activision has teamed with the [[United Service Organizations]] to provide monetary support and copies of ''Guitar Hero III'' to the [[United States armed forces]] around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://investor.activision.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=346328 | title = Activision Publishing Partners With USO to Bring Entertainment to Troops This Holiday Season | publisher = [[MarketWatch]] | date = 2008-11-06 | accessdate = 2008-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Guitar Hero'' has proven to be a useful tool in the development of children and as recovery for various injuries.

==On the video game industry==

Over 20 million songs have been sold as downloadable content as of July 2008, and 34 million by May 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://uk.reuters.com/article/2008/07/13/uk-guitarhero-idUKN1245149420080713 | title = RedOctane execs on a roll with "Guitar Hero" | publisher = Reuters | first = Antony | last = Bruno | date = 2008-07-13 | accessdate = 2008-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of October 9, 2008, the series has sold 23 million units with sales of US$1.6 billion, and as of May 2009 has earned US$2 billion at retail.

''Guitar Hero'' and other rock music-based games work with [[record company|record companies]] to license each song for its use, costing a per-song average of [[USD|$]]25,000 for the rights to use a master recording and [[USD|$]]10,000 for the rights to make a cover.&lt;ref name="lat music licensing"/&gt;  The impact of ''Guitar Hero'' and ''Rock Band'' has caused record companies to create dedicated video game liaisons to handle the inclusions of songs in these games.&lt;ref name="independent gh influence"/&gt; The record and game companies work together to tie in releases of downloadable content with album releases and concert appearances, such as by the simultaneous release of [[Metallica]]'s ''Death Magnetic'' album and as playable ''Guitar Hero'' tracks.&lt;ref name="independent gh influence"/&gt;  However, some in the music industry have raised concerns that the music labels are not receiving fair compensation considering the success of the games.  Edgar Bronfman Jr., chairman and chief executive for [[Warner Music Group]], stated that "The amount being paid to the industry, even though their games are entirely dependent on the content that we own and control, is far too small."&lt;ref name="lat music licensing"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://articles.latimes.com/2008/aug/18/business/fi-music18 | title = Record labels seek more action on Rock Band and Guitar Hero | publisher = ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' | date = 2008-08-18 | accessdate = 2008-08-18 | first = Michelle | last = Quinn |author2=Pham, Alex}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tim Riley, vice president of music affairs at Activision, believes that the increase in popularity of the game series has led more people, including musicians and music labels, to want to be part of the success: "The number of people interested in being associated with the game is probably a thousand times more than we can get into the game."&lt;ref name="lat music licensing"/&gt;  Activision CEO Robert Kotick has stated, in response to the record company's claims, that the impact that the ''Guitar Hero'' games have caused game developers and publishers to question if they "should be paying any money at all and whether it should be the reverse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.next-gen.biz/news/activision-maybe-music-labels-should-pay-us | title = Activision: Maybe Music Labels Should Pay Us | first = Kris | last = Graft | date = 2008-09-26 | accessdate = 2008-09-26 | publisher = ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091114155224/http://www.next-gen.biz/news/activision-maybe-music-labels-should-pay-us | archivedate = 2009-11-14 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Mötley Crüe]] manager Allen Kovac noted that artists make a larger share of the sale of each downloaded game song compared to [[iTunes]], and that bands that own their own master recordings earn even a larger percentage from music licensing rights.&lt;ref name="ew gh vs rb"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20222986,00.html | title = 'Rock Band' vs. 'Guitar Hero': Fall's Biggest Music Battle  | publisher = ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' | first = Shirley | last = Halperin | date = 2008-09-02 | accessdate = 2008-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Michael Pachter]], an industry analyst for Wedbush Morgan, noted that ''Guitar Hero'' is not dependent on a single record label, as there is nearly a 2000-year supply of songs available at the current rate of content releases, and a full music industry denial to the game series could lead to [[anti-trust]] measures.  Patcher also contrasted Bronfman's view, stating that users are not buying the games for the songs, but for the game, with each song providing its own challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=20002 | title = Analyst: Activision Doesn't Need Warner Music | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] | date = 2008-08-27 | accessdate = 2008-09-26 | first = Leigh | last = Alexander }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, analysis believe that Activision's attitude on music licensing may have influenced the decision of Apple Corps, Ltd. to give the lucrative licensing agreement for The Beatles' music to MTV Games, who were more flexible in their negotiations.&lt;ref name="reuters rock band"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2008/11/01/us-games-idUSTRE4A004520081101 | title = MTV and Activision face off in battle of the brands | first = Antony | last = Bruno | date = 2008-10-31 | accessdate = 2008-11-03 | publisher = Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some musicians have been critical of ''Guitar Hero'''s impact on the industry. [[Jack White (musician)|Jack White]] of [[The White Stripes]] stated that he was disappointed to learn that video games are the most likely venue where younger audiences will be exposed to new works, while Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin does not believe that people can learn how to play real instruments from their video game counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nme.com/news/the-white-stripes/45521 | title = Jack White and Jimmy Page diss 'Guitar Hero' video game | publisher = [[NME]] | date = 2009-06-22 | accessdate = 2009-06-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Prince has turned down opportunities to have his music in the series, stating that he felt that it was "more important that kids learn how to actually play the guitar".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/kcet/tavissmiley/archive/200904/20090428_prince.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5hO40dHzy?url=http://www.pbs.org/kcet/tavissmiley/archive/200904/20090428_prince.html |archivedate=2009-06-08 |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] |date=2009-04-28 |accessdate=2009-04-30 |title=Prince |first=Tavis |last=Smiley |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Guitar Hero II'' is the centerpiece of an episode of ''[[South Park]]'' titled "[[Guitar Queer-O]]", in which Stan and Kyle overindulge in ''Guitar Hero II'' and become treated as though they were real-life rock stars.

'''David Stahel''' (born 1975 in [[Wellington]], New Zealand) is a historian, author and professor of history at the [[University of New South Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unsw.adfa.edu.au/school-of-humanities-and-social-sciences/dr-david-stahel |title=Dr David Stahel |publisher=University of New South Wales |accessdate=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He specialises in German military history of [[World War II]]. Stahel authored several books on the military operations of the first six months of the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], including on the launching of [[Operation Barbarossa]], the [[Battle of Kiev (1941)]] and the [[Battle for Moscow]].

==Education and career==
Stahel completed an honours degree at [[Monash University]] and [[Boston College]]. He has an MA in War Studies from [[King's College London]] and a PhD in 2007 from the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]]. He joined the [[University of New South Wales]] Canberra in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hass.unsw.adfa.edu.au/staff/profiles/stahel.html|title=School of Humanities and Social Sciences|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military historian of Nazi Germany==
Stahel authored several books on the military operations on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], including [[Operation Barbarossa]], the [[Battle of Kiev (1941)]] and the [[Battle of Moscow]]; all books were published by [[Cambridge University Press]]. Reviewing Stahel's ''Kiev 1941: Hitler's Battle for Supremacy in the East'' for the ''[[The New Republic|New Republic]]'', the historian [[Richard J. Evans|Richard Evans]] notes that "the story of the Battle of Kiev has been told many times, but seldom in such detail as it is in David Stahel’s book", at the same time "convey[ing] extremely complex military action with exemplary clarity". The reviewer writes:{{sfn|Evans|2012}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;Unlike more traditional military historians, Stahel is acutely aware of the wider context of the action, from Hitler’s overall aims for the war to the importance of logistics for the outcome; from the murderous racism and ruthless pragmatism with which the German leaders, military as well as political, condemned so many Soviet civilians to starve and so many Jewish inhabitants to terrible death, to the postwar disputes among historians and retired generals over Hitler’s strategy.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Evans commends Stahel for his "refreshing realism" in not "following traditional military historians’ often overly positive and simplistic descriptions of 'great' generals and 'decisive' battles" and exploring "convincingly if not entirely originally" how the foundations of the German war efforts were already beginning to crumble by the time of the [[Battle of Kiev (1941)|victory at Kiev]] heralded in [[Nazi propaganda]] as decisive.{{sfn|Evans|2012}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22444">'''Dioceses of the Church of the East, 1318–1552''' were [[metropolitan province]]s and [[diocese]]s of the [[Church of the East]], during the period from 1318 to 1552. They were far fewer in number than during the period of the Church's greatest expansion in the tenth century. Between 1318 and 1552, the geographical horizons of the Church of the East, which had once stretched from Egypt to China, narrowed drastically. By 1552, with the exception of a number of [[East Syriac Rite|East Syriac]] communities in India, the eccesiastical jurisdiction of the Church of the East was confined to its original heartland in northern [[Mesopotamia]].

== Background ==

=== Consolidation of East Syriac Christianity in northern Mesopotamia ===
By the end of the thirteenth century, although isolated East Syriac outposts persisted to the southeast of the [[Great Zab]], the districts of northern Mesopotamia included in the metropolitan provinces of [[Mosul]] and [[Nisibis]] were clearly regarded as the heartland of the Church of the East. When the monks Bar Sawma and Marcos (the future patriarch [[Yahballaha III]]) arrived in Mesopotamia from China in the late 1270s, they visited several East Syriac monasteries and churches:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
They arrived in Baghdad, and from there they went to the great church of Kokhe, and to the monastery of Mar Mari the apostle, and received a blessing from the relics of that country.  And from there they turned back and came to the country of Beth Garmaï, and they received blessings from the shrine of Mar Ezekiel, which was full of helps and healings.  And from there they went to Erbil, and from there to Mosul.  And they went to Shigar, and Nisibis and Mardin, and were blessed by the shrine containing the bones of Mar Awgin, the second Christ.  And from there they went to [[Gazarta]] d'Beth Zabdaï, and they were blessed by all the shrines and monasteries, and the religious houses, and the monks, and the fathers in their dioceses.&lt;ref&gt;Wallis Budge, ''The Monks of Kublai Khan'', 142–3&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With the exception of the patriarchal church of Kokhe in [[Baghdad]] and the nearby monastery of Mar Mari, all these sites were well to the north of Baghdad, in the districts of northern Mesopotamia where historic East Syriac Christianity survived into the twentieth century.

A similar pattern is evident several years later. Eleven bishops were present at the consecration of the Patriarch [[Timothy II (Nestorian Patriarch)|Timothy II]] in 1318:  the metropolitans Joseph of {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Ilam, {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Abdisho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}} of Nisibis and Shem{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}on of Mosul, and the bishops Shem{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}on of [[Beth Garmaï (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)|Beth Garmaï]], Shem{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}on of Tirhan, Shem{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}on of Balad, Yohannan of Beth Waziq, Yohannan of Shigar, {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Abdisho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}} of Hnitha, Isaac of Beth Daron and Isho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}yahb of Tella and Barbelli (Marga). Timothy himself had been metropolitan of [[Arbil|Erbil]] before his election as patriarch. Again, with the exception of {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Ilam (whose metropolitan, Joseph, was present in his capacity of 'designated successor' (''natar kursya'') all the dioceses represented were in northern Mesopotamia.

=== Collapse of the exterior provinces ===
The exterior provinces of the Church of the East, with the important exception of India, collapsed during the second half of the fourteenth century. Although little is known of the circumstances of the demise of the East Syriac dioceses in Central Asia (which may never have fully recovered from the destruction caused by the [[Mongol]]s a century earlier), it may have been due to a combination of persecution, disease, and isolation.

The blame for the destruction of the East Syriac communities east of Iraq has often been thrown upon the Turco-Mongol leader [[Timur]], whose campaigns during the 1390s spread havoc throughout Persia and Central Asia. There is no reason to doubt that the destruction wrought by Timur fell indiscriminately upon Christians and Muslims alike, but in many parts of Central Asia, Christianity had died out decades before Timur's campaigns. The surviving evidence from Central Asia, including a large number of dated graves, indicates that the crisis for the East Syriac church occurred in the 1340s rather than the 1390s.

Several contemporaries, including the papal envoy [[John of Marignolli]], mention the murder of the Latin bishop Richard and six of his companions in 1339 or 1340 by a Muslim mob in Almaliq, the chief city of Tangut, and the forcible conversion of the city’s Christians to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Yule and Cordier, ''Cathay and the Way Thither'', iii. 31–3 and 212&lt;/ref&gt; The last tombstones in two East Syriac cemeteries discovered in Mongolia around the end of the nineteenth century date from 1342, and several commemorate deaths during a plague in 1338.&lt;ref&gt;Nau, ‘Les pierres tombales nestoriennes du musée Guimet’, ''ROC'', 18 (1913), 3–35&lt;/ref&gt; In China, the last references to East Syriac and Latin Christians date from the 1350s, and it is likely that all foreign Christians were expelled from China soon after the revolution of 1368, which replaced the [[Mongol]] [[Yuan Dynasty|Yuan dynasty]] with the xenophobic [[Ming Dynasty|Ming dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Moule, ''Christians in China before the Year 1550'', 216–40&lt;/ref&gt;

The collapse of East Syriac Christianity in Asia was probably so complete because it had always been the custom of the Church of the East to send out bishops from Mesopotamia to the dioceses of the ‘exterior provinces’. In the chaos which followed the death of the Ilkhan [[Abu Sa'id (Ilkhanid dynasty)|Abu Sa{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}id]] in 1335, it may have been unable to send out fresh bishops to Central Asia, and without leaders of their own, the absorption of these communities by Islam was inevitable.

===Campaigns of Timur, 1380–1405===
[[File:Mongol dominions1.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Timur Leng's empire, ''c.''1405]]
It is possible that several East Syriac dioceses in Iraq were destroyed during the savage campaigns of Timur in western Asia between 1380 and 1405. The [[West Syriac Rite|West Syriac]] centre of [[Tagrit]] in the {{transl|sem |Ṭ}}irhan district was sacked by Timur, ending its importance as the residence of the local [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac Orthodox]] primates, titled as [[maphrian]]s, and the neighbouring East Syriac communities in Beth Garmaï and [[Adiabene]] may have been treated in a similar fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Fiey, ''Communautés syriaques'', 289–342&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of a better context, the disappearance of the traditional East Syriac dioceses of Beth Waziq, Beth Daron, [[Tirhan (East Syrian Diocese)|Tirhan]] and [[Daquq]]a, all of which had bishops earlier in the fourteenth century, may have been a result of Timur’s campaigns. In {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Ilam, the metropolitan diocese of [[Jundishapur]] (last mentioned in 1318) and the dioceses of [[Susa]] and [[Shushter]] (last mentioned towards the end of the thirteenth century) may also have come to an end at this period.

By contrast, East Syriac Christianity continued to flourish in northern Mesopotamia. Although East Syriac communities disappeared from several villages in the Nisibis and Mosul districts in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, patterns of settlement seem generally to have persisted without radical disturbance. Although insufficient information has survived to be certain, there may well have been a continuous succession of bishops in the dioceses of Nisibis, Mosul and Erbil, and perhaps also in the dioceses of Hesna d’Kifa, [[Gazarta]], [[Salmas]] and [[Urmia|Urmi]]. Timur’s campaigns may have stimulated a migration of East Syriac Christians from the plains into the hills of the [[Bohtan]] and [[Hakkari]] districts, as a new diocese was created in the fifteenth century for Atel and Bohtan, and perhaps around the same time for Berwari.

During the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, there was also a metropolitan diocese for an East Syriac merchant community in [[Cyprus]]. This community came under strong pressure from the [[Catholic Church|Latin Church]], and the diocese lapsed after the metropolitan Timothy converted to Catholicism in 1445.&lt;ref&gt;Fiey, ''POCN'', 71&lt;/ref&gt;

By the middle of the sixteenth century, the East Syriac communities in India were all that survived of the Church of the East’s exterior provinces (though the names of the old provinces of [[Armenia]], Arzun, [[Jerusalem]] and China persisted or were later revived in the titles of the metropolitans of Nisibis, Hesna d’Kifa, [[Amid]] and India respectively).  In the west there were small East Syriac communities in Jerusalem, [[Aleppo]], and Cyprus, but without bishops. Small communities could still be found in the [[Erbil Governorate|Erbil]], [[Kirkuk]] and [[Tabriz]] districts, but the main strength of the church was confined to northern Mesopotamia, in the districts which had earlier comprised the metropolitan provinces of Nisibis and Mosul.  Although there was continuous East Syriac settlement in these districts between the thirteenth and sixteenth centuries the traditional dioceses of Beth Nuhadra, Beth Bgash, Marga (Tella and Barbelli), Hnitha and Salakh in the province of Mosul, and Balad and Tamanon in the province of Nisibis, ceased to exist at an unknown date during this period.

=== East Syriac mission to India, 1490–1503 ===
Between 1490 and 1503, the Church of the East responded to the request of a mission to Mesopotamia from the East Syriac Christians of the [[Malabar Coast]] of India for bishops to be sent out to them. In 1490, two Christians from Malabar arrived in [[Gazarta]] to petition the Patriarch Shem{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}on IV to consecrate a bishop for their church. Two monks of the monastery of Mar Awgin were consecrated bishops and were sent to India. Shem{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}on IV died in 1497, to be followed by the short-reigned Shem{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}on V, who died in 1502. His successor, Eliya V, consecrated three more bishops for India in April 1503. These bishops sent a report to the Patriarch from India in 1504, describing the condition of the East Syriac Church in India and reporting the recent arrival of the [[Portugal|Portuguese]]. Eliya had already died by the time this letter arrived in Mesopotamia, and it was received by his successor, Shem{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}on VI (1504–38).&lt;ref&gt;MSS Vat Syr 204a and Paris BN Syr 25&lt;/ref&gt;

== East Syriac bishops, 1318–1552 ==
[[File:Rabban Hurmizd.jpg|thumb|right|250ppx|The monastery of [[Rabban Hormizd Monastery|Rabban Hormizd]], [[Alqosh]]]]
The disappearance of so many old dioceses was probably a consequence of the introduction of hereditary succession in the middle of the fifteenth century by the Patriarch Shem{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}on IV, which eventually resulted in a shortage of bishops in the Church of the East. The Patriarch [[Shemon VII Ishoyahb|Shem{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}on VII Isho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}yahb]] is said to have entrusted the administration of some vacant dioceses to laymen, and to have consecrated two nephews as metropolitans, aged twelve and fifteen respectively, presumably because no older relatives were available. In 1552, the Church of the East had only three bishops; the bishops of Salmas, Erbil and Adarbaigan, who all supported [[Shimun VIII Yohannan Sulaqa|Sulaqa]]’s election.

=== The Diocese of Nisibis ===
The diocese of [[Nisibis]], the seat of an East Syriac metropolitan bishop since 410, survived into the second decade of the seventeenth century. By then, Nisibis was little more than a village and the future of East Syriac Christianity in the region lay with the Chaldean communities recently established in the towns of [[Amid]] and [[Mardin]]. Both these towns had energetic Chaldean bishops at this period, and the historic diocese of Nisibis was in consequence formally abolished at the Chaldean Synod of Amid in 1616. The title of Nisibis was thereafter included in the title of the metropolitans of Mardin.

Several metropolitans of Nisibis are attested between 1318 and 1616. The celebrated East Syriac author {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Abdisho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}} Bar Brikha, who flourished during the reign of the patriarch [[Yaballaha III|Yahballaha III]] (1281–1317), was metropolitan of Nisibis during the early years of the fourteenth century and was present at the consecration of the Patriarch Timothy II in 1318. The date of his death is not known, but according to a list of metropolitans of Nisibis compiled in the second half of the fourteenth century, his immediate successors were Mikha'il, {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Abdisho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}, Yahballaha and Isho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}yahb.&lt;ref&gt;Fiey, ''Nisibe'', 109–10&lt;/ref&gt;

Three metropolitans of Nisibis are known from the fifteenth century. A metropolitan named Timothy is mentioned in the colophon of a manuscript copied in 1429/30.&lt;ref&gt;MS Paris BN Syr 184&lt;/ref&gt;  A metropolitan named {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Abdisho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}} donated a manuscript to the church of Mar Pethion in Amid in May 1458.&lt;ref&gt;MS Jerusalem Syr 12&lt;/ref&gt; The metropolitan Eliya of 'Nisibis, Armenia, Mardin, Amid, [[Siirt]] and Hesna d'Kifa' is mentioned in the colophons of three manuscripts copied between 1477 and 1483.&lt;ref&gt;MSS Kirkuk (Vosté) 39, Diyarbakr (Scher) 73 and Mardin (Scher) 43&lt;/ref&gt;

No metropolitans of Nisibis are attested during the first half of the sixteenth century, and the office may well have remained vacant for much of this period. If so, the vacancy was filled shortly after the schism of 1552. A metropolitan of Nisibis named Isho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}yahb, son of the priest Samuel of Mosul, is mentioned in the colophons of a series of manuscripts copied between 1554 and 1575, associated with the traditionalist Patriarch Shem{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}on VII Isho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}yahb and his successor [[Eliya VII]]. Unusually for a metropolitan of Nisibis, his title also included Amid and Mardin, both of which had Catholic bishops consecrated by Sulaqa, and he was probably consecrated by Shem{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}on VII Isho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}yahb in response to the strong Catholic challenge mounted by Sulaqa in the western districts.&lt;ref&gt;MSS Vat Syr 184 and 567, Diyarbakr (Scher) 44 and 84, Jerusalem Syr 8 and Cambridge Add. 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Diocese of Erbil ===
The metropolitan Joseph of Erbil became patriarch in 1318, taking the name Timothy II.  The diocese of Erbil seems to have persisted into the seventeenth century, but only four subsequent metropolitans of Erbil are known. The metropolitan Yohannan Bar Yak, who flourished at an unknown date in the fourteenth century, was the author of several verses preserved in a manuscript in the Mardin collection. In the fifteenth century, the writer Isho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}yahb Bar Mqaddam, one of the few known East Syriac authors at this period, is mentioned as metropolitan of Erbil in 1443 and 1452, and may have taken the name Thomas. The three remaining bishops in the East Syriac hierarchy who supported Sulaqa's election in 1552 included an unnamed metropolitan of Erbil.

=== The Diocese of Atel and Bohtan ===
An East Syriac diocese for Atel and the [[Bohtan]] district, which persisted into the seventeenth century, appears to have been founded in the fifteenth century. The earliest-known bishop of Atel, Quriaqos, is mentioned in the colophon of a manuscript copied in 1437.&lt;ref&gt;MS Seert (Scher) 119&lt;/ref&gt;

A metropolitan of Atel named Yohannan is mentioned in a colophon of 1497, and was probably the metropolitan Mar Yohannan present five years later at the consecration of the patriarch Eliya V in September 1502.&lt;ref&gt;MSS Mosul (Scher) 15 and Paris BN Syr 25&lt;/ref&gt; An elderly bishop named Yohannan, perhaps the same man, was killed at Atel on 6 June 1512 with 40 other persons, including Christian priests and deacons, by the soldiers of Muhammad Bek.&lt;ref&gt;Scher, ''Épisodes'', 124; and MS Seert (Scher) 55&lt;/ref&gt;

A few years later, three colophons mention another bishop of Atel named Yohannan: as bishop of the 'Bokhtaye' in 1521, as bishop of 'Atel and the Bokhtaye' in 1526, and as bishop of 'Atel and Dilan' in 1534.&lt;ref&gt;MSS Mosul (Scher) 74, Paris BN Syr 345 and a manuscript of 1534 copied in Zakho (Fiey, ''Nisibe'', 230)&lt;/ref&gt; He is perhaps to be identified with the bishop Yohannan 'of the fortress of Atel' who was burned at the stake at Amid in 1572.&lt;ref&gt;MS Seert (Scher) 55; Scher, ''Épisodes'', 124; and Giamil, ''Genuinae Relationes'', 111–12&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Diocese of Cyprus ===
[[File:Nestorianische Kirche C.jpg|thumb|right|250ppx|A Nestorian church (1350) in Famagusta, Cyprus.]]
An East Syriac merchant community was established in Cyprus after the fall of Acre in 1292. After the destruction of the Frankish kingdoms in Syria and Palestine, Cyprus became the forward base for crusading activity during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, and Famagusta replaced Acre as a centre for trade with the cities of northern Syria and Cilicia. By the end of the fourteenth century, the island was the seat of a Nestorian metropolitan, who seems to have inherited the title of Tarsus. The Latin Church exerted considerable pressure on this heretical community. In 1340, the Nestorian metropolitan Eliya made a Catholic profession of faith, and in 1445, the metropolitan Timothy also converted to Catholicism.  Most of the Nestorians of Cyprus followed the example of their bishops. To distinguish these converts from their recalcitrant Nestorian brethren, [[Pope Eugene IV]] christened them 'Chaldeans', because they used the Chaldean language (as Syriac was then called in western Europe). By the middle of the sixteenth century, the island's remaining Nestorians were confined to the town of [[Famagusta]]. This community was dispersed within a few decades of the town’s capture by the Turks in 1571, but a fine fourteenth-century Nestorian church, built in Provençal style by the wealthy merchant prince Francis Lakhas, can still be seen in Famagusta.&lt;ref&gt;Fiey, ''POCN'', 71; Wilmshurst, ''EOCE'', 66&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Forgotten Voices of the Holocaust''''' is a collection of interviews with victims of the [[Holocaust]] as well as people who collaborated with or worked directly for the [[Nazi]] regime.  The [[Imperial War Museum]] commissioned [[Lyn Smith]] to work with them on their sound archive.  The interviews she brought together are now part of their permanent Holocaust exhibit as well as being set down in this book from [[Ebury Press]].

The book is written by Smith, who puts the interviews into chronological order and gives context to the events surrounding them.  It also features a foreword by [[Laurence Rees]].

'''Frederick Charles Copleston''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|CBE}} &lt;small&gt;[[Jesuit|SJ]]&lt;/small&gt; (10 April 1907 – 3 February 1994) was a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priest, philosopher, and [[History of philosophy|historian of philosophy]], best known for his influential multi-volume ''[[A History of Philosophy (Copleston)|A History of Philosophy]]'' (1946–74).

Copleston achieved a degree of popularity in the media for debating the [[existence of God]] with [[Bertrand Russell]] in a celebrated 1948 [[BBC]] broadcast; the following year he debated [[logical positivism]] and the meaningfulness of [[Sacred language|religious language]] with his friend the [[analytic philosophy|analytic philosopher]] [[A. J. Ayer]].

==Biography==
{{Jesuit}}
Frederick Charles Copleston was born 10 April 1907 near [[Taunton]], Somerset, England. He was raised in the [[Anglican]] faith—his uncle, [[Reginald Stephen Copleston]], was an [[Anglican Diocese of Calcutta|Anglican bishop of Calcutta]]; another uncle, [[Ernest Copleston]], was the [[Bishop of Colombo]]. Copleston was educated at [[Marlborough College]] from 1920 to 1925.&lt;ref name="gifford"/&gt; At the age of eighteen, he converted to the Roman Catholic faith, which caused great stress in his family.&lt;ref name="gifford"/&gt; Despite his initial objections, his father helped him complete his education at [[St John's College, Oxford]], where he studied from 1925 to 1929. He graduated from [[Oxford University]] in 1929 having managed a third in classical moderations and a good second at [[Literae Humaniores|Greats]].&lt;ref name="gifford"/&gt;

In 1930, Copleston became a [[Jesuit]].&lt;ref name="gifford"/&gt; After studying at the Jesuit novitiate in Roehampton for two years, he resettled at Heythrop, where in 1937 he was ordained a Jesuit priest at [[Heythrop College, University of London|Heythrop College]].&lt;ref name="gifford"/&gt; In 1938 he traveled to Germany to complete his training, returning to Britain just before the outbreak of war in 1939.&lt;ref name="gifford"/&gt; Copleston originally intended to study for his doctorate at the Gregorian University in Rome, but the war now made that impossible. Instead, he accepted an offer to return to Heythrop College to teach the history of philosophy to the few remaining Jesuits there.&lt;ref name="gifford"/&gt;

While teaching at Heythrop College, Copleston began writing his influential multi-volume ''[[A History of Philosophy (Copleston)|A History of Philosophy]]'' (1946–75), a textbook that presents clear accounts of [[ancient philosophy|ancient]], medieval, and modern philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;The original edition and Double Day edition were published in 9 volumes, whereas the Continuum edition was published in 11 volumes.&lt;/ref&gt; Still highly respected, Copleston's history has been described as "a monumental achievement" that "stays true to the authors it discusses, being very much a work in exposition".&lt;ref name="gifford"/&gt;

Copleston achieved a degree of popularity in the media for [[Copleston–Russell debate|debating]] the [[existence of God]] with [[Bertrand Russell]] in a celebrated 1948 [[BBC]] broadcast;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Debate on the Existence of God |publisher=YouTube | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPdpEJk78E |accessdate=8 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the following year he debated [[logical positivism]] and the meaningfulness of [[Sacred language|religious language]] with his friend the [[analytic philosophy|analytic philosopher]] [[A. J. Ayer]].&lt;ref name="telegraph-beeson"/&gt;

Throughout the rest of his academic career, Copleston accepted a number of honorary roles, including Visiting Professor at [[Pontifical Gregorian University]] in Rome, where he spent six months each year lecturing from 1952 to 1968.&lt;ref name="gifford"/&gt; In 1970, he was made Fellow of the [[British Academy]] (FBA), and in 1972 he was given a personal professorship from Heythrop College, since re-established by the [[University of London]]. In 1975, he was made an Honorary Fellow of St. John's College, Oxford.&lt;ref name="gifford"/&gt;

After officially retiring in 1974, he continued to lecture. From 1974 to 1982, Copleston was Visiting Professor at the [[Santa Clara University|University of Santa Clara]], and from 1979 to 1981, he delivered the [[Gifford Lectures]] at the [[University of Aberdeen]], which were published as ''Religion and the One''. These lectures were attempted to "express themes perennial in his thinking and more personal than in his history".&lt;ref name="gifford"/&gt; Toward the end of his life, Copleston received honorary doctorates from several institutions, including Santa Clara University, California, [[Uppsala University]], and the [[University of St Andrews]].&lt;ref name="gifford"/&gt;

Copleston was offered memberships in the [[Royal Institute of Philosophy]] and in the [[Aristotelian Society]].&lt;ref name="gifford-fcc"/&gt; In 1993 he was made [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]].&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt; Copleston died on 3 February 1994 at [[St Thomas' Hospital]] in London, at the age of 86.&lt;ref name="gifford"/&gt;

==Legacy==
{{Further|A History of Philosophy (Copleston)}}
In addition to his influential multi-volume ''[[A History of Philosophy (Copleston)|History of Philosophy]]'' (1946–75), one of Copleston's most significant contributions to modern philosophy was his work on the theories of Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]]. He attempted to clarify Aquinas's [[Quinquae viae|Five Ways]] (in the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'') by making a distinction between ''[[in fieri]]'' causes and ''[[in esse]]'' causes. By doing so, Copleston makes clear that Aquinas wanted to put forth the concept of an omnipresent God rather than a being that could have disappeared after setting the chain of cause and effect into motion.&lt;ref name="ashgate-hensel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="abingdon"/&gt;

{{Portal|Christianity in China}}
'''Giulio Aleni''' ({{lang-la|Julius Alenius}}; 1582{{nbsp}}– June 10, 1649), in Chinese {{nowrap|'''Ai Rulüe'''}}, was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Jesuit]] [[missionary]] and [[scholar]]. He was born in Leno near  [[Brescia]] in Italy, at the time part of the Republic of Venice, and died at [[Nanping|Yanping]] in [[Ming Dynasty|China]]. He became a member of the [[Society of Jesus]] in 1600 and distinguished himself in his knowledge of mathematics and theology.&lt;ref name="Witek "&gt;John Witek, S.J. "Aleni, Giulio, in Gerald Anderson, ed., ''Biographical Dictionary of Christian Missions'' (Erdmans, ) pp. 9-10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
In  1610, he was sent as a missionary to [[China]]. While waiting at [[Macau]] for a favorable opportunity to enter the country he taught mathematics to local scholars and published his "Observation sur l'éclipse de lune du 8 Novembre 1612, faite a Macao" (''Mémoires de l'Acad. des Sciences'', VII, 706.)

He adopted the dress and manners of the country, was the first Christian missionary in [[Jiangxi]], and built several churches in [[Fujian]]. One of his converts, a scholar name Li Jiubiao, recorded Aleni's and [[Andrius Rudamina]]'s, one of his fellow Jesuits, responses to the questions and speculations of his parishioners and compiled them into a journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Zürcher, Erik Li Jiubiao Institut Monumenta Serica  |first =  |date = 2007 |title = Kouduo Richao: Li Jiubiao's Diary of Oral Admonitions: A Late Ming Christian Journal|publisher = Steyler Verl.| location = Nettetal |isbn = 9783805005432|ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
He published works in Chinese on a variety of topics. His cosmography, ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20140224173441/http://ricci.rt.usfca.edu/bibliography/view.aspx?bibliographyID=1242 Wanwu Zhenyuan]'' (The True Origin of the Ten-thousand Things), was translated into [[Manchu language|Manchu]] during the reign of [[Kangxi Emperor|Kang-he]] as {{ManchuSibeUnicode|ᡨᡠᠮᡝᠨ&lt;br&gt;ᠵᠠᡴᠠᡳ&lt;br&gt;ᡠᠨᡝᠩᡴᡳ&lt;br&gt;ᠰᡝᡴᡳᠶᡝᠨ}} Wylie: Tumen chakai unengki sekiyen, [[Transliterations of Manchu|Möllendorff]]: Tumen jakai unengki sekiyen. A copy was sent from [[Beijing]] to Paris in 1789. He completed the work of earlier Jesuit scholars to produce the ''[[Zhifang waiji]]'', China's first global geography.&lt;ref name=wdl&gt;{{cite web|url={{wdl|227}} |author=Li, Zhizao |title=職方外紀 六卷卷首一卷 (Zhifang waiji) |trans-title=Chronicle of Foreign Lands |language=Chinese |location=Hangzhou, China |date=1623 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among his most important religious works are a controversial treatise on the Catholic Faith, in which are refuted what he saw as the principal errors of the Chinese; and ''The Life of God, the Saviour, from the Four Gospels'' (Peking, 1635–1637, 8 vols.; often reprinted, e.g. in 1887 in 3 vols) and used even by Protestant missionaries.

==Legacy==
The life and works of Giulio Aleni are the subject of several conferences in 1994 and 2010. Two of his books, ''Life of [[Matteo Ricci]], Xitai of the West'' and ''Holy images of the Heavenly Lord'' have been presented to the public by ''Fondazione Civiltà Bresciana'' in two separate occasions, on 13 and 25 October 2010.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5182">'''''Halbstarke''''' ("beatnik", literally "half-strongs") is a German term describing a [[postwar]]-period [[subculture]] of [[adolescent]]s – mostly [[male]] and of [[working class]] parents – that appeared in public in an [[aggressive]] and [[Agent provocateur|provocative]] way during the 1950s in [[Germany]], [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]].  Later, the term sometimes described youths in general.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} While in German, it is still in use today for young, aggressive, mostly male adolescents,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duden.de/duden-suche/werke/fx/000/067/Halbstarke.67129.html Duden: Halbstarke] (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; it has mostly fallen out of active usage in English{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}.

==Literal meaning==
The word itself literally means “the half-strong”.  Its origins can be traced back to a manufacturing technology named ''{{lang|de|Walken}}'' (= to tumble/ mill/ full), via the word’s synonym ''{{lang|de|Halbgewalkte}}''– “half tumbleds”.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}  Seen that way, the word is a defamation, because it can be [[Association (psychology)|associated]] with “unformed” and “premature” (in German, there also are a few other slight verbal slanders containing “halb”: e.g. ''{{lang|de|halbgebildet}}'' (literally: half-educated) and ''{{lang|de|halbe Portion}}'' (literally: half dish / half portion, used for children or adolescents that appear weak{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}).  But it is likely that the defamation was not as defamatory to the subculture itself, because its members began calling themselves “Halbstarke”, too. 
In German, both terms also have an [[adjective]]-form (''{{lang|de|halbstark}}'' / ''{{lang|de|halbgewalkt}}'').

==“Halbstarke“ during the 50s==
These ''{{lang|de|Halbstarken}}'' had found prototypes for their fashion and style in American movies, e.g. [[James Dean]] in ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'' (German title: ''{{lang|de|…denn sie wissen nicht, was sie tun}}'') and [[Marlon Brando]], as well as the stars of [[rock 'n' roll]], that was gaining popularity then. In 1956 [[Karin Baal]] and [[Horst Buchholz]] became idols thanks to the movie ''[[Die Halbstarken]]''. That same year Bill Haley &amp; His Comets' song Rock Around The Clock reached #1 in the German Pop charts.
Often, the ''{{lang|de|Halbstarken}}'' wore a quiff, [[jeans]], checked shirts and leather jackets. Their look separated them from the other, more widespread, German youth culture. [[Moped]]s and [[motorbike]]s were very popular and used for riding in 'gangs' (as seen in American movies).
Because there weren't a lot of alternatives, the Halbstarken often spent their leisure time outdoors. Their cliques met at corners of the road, in parks or at other public places. This behaviour wasn’t appreciated by elder citizens and so they described it as “bumming around” (''{{lang|de|gammeln}}'').
Rock 'n' roll offered tunes and rhythms that were revolutionary and a catalyzer for the youths' emotions and fears, unlike the then-popular but shallow genre [[Schlager]]. The effect of this was probably maximized by the new music being rejected by wide parts of the population.
During the 1950s, more or less 5% of youth could be referred to as ''{{lang|de|Halbstarke}}''.

==Riots by the Halbstarken==
The first Halbstarken riots happened after concerts or cinema screenings, which usually were preceded later uprisings as well. 
On December 30, 1956 about 4000 juveniles walked through Dortmund’s city, affronting passers-by, rampaging and having battles with the police, after a cinema show of ''[[Außer Rand und Band]]'' (''[[Rock Around the Clock (film)|Rock Around the Clock]]'' with [[Bill Haley]])
Big riots occurred especially from 1956 to 1958. Often, the furniture of cinemas and concert halls was totally destroyed. These riots started severe discussions in media and politics. 
The seeming sense- and directionlessness of the riots wasn’t comprehensible. Often, the American [[popular culture]] was considered guilty.
Nowadays, the riots and all of the Halbstarken-phenomenon is seen as a protest against society and its authorities which seemed draconic and bleak. But the protest was neither organized nor politically motivated.

His writings are frequently quoted by [[Diogenes Laërtius]].&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, i. 19, 42; ii. 88; v. 90; vi. 85, 102; vii. 25, 38; viii. 43, 51, 72; ix. 5, 40, 115&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote ''On the Sects'' ({{lang-el|Περὶ Αἱρέσεων}})&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, i. 19, ii. 88&lt;/ref&gt; and a ''Register of Philosophers'' ({{lang-el|Τῶν Φιλοσόφων Ἀναγραφή}}).&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, i. 42&lt;/ref&gt; He treated philosophers as early as the [[Seven Sages of Greece|Seven Sages]] and [[Pythagoras]], and as late as [[Crates of Thebes|Crates]], [[Menedemus the Cynic|Menedemus]], and [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]], hence it is inferred that he wrote in the 3rd or 2nd century BC. His work included lists of pupils of Zeno&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vii. 38&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Timon of Phlius|Timon]].&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, ix. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Diogenes Laërtius relates that Hippobotus refused to put the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]], [[Eleatic]] and Dialectical schools into his ''On Sects''.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, i. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hopewell pottery''' is the ceramic tradition of the various local cultures involved in the [[Hopewell tradition]] (ca. 200 BCE to 400 CE)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp "Hopewell (Archaeology)."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120820033016/http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp |date=2012-08-20 }} ''Wisconsin Historical Society.'' (retrieved 19 July 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; and are found as [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] in [[archeological site]]s in the American Midwest and Southeast. The Hopewell were located around the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] and [[Illinois River]]s during the [[Woodland period|Middle Woodland Period]], and the Hopewell Interaction Sphere spanned from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to [[Ontario]], Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Berlo and Phillips, 77&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
This pottery was used in a variety of ways: from storage and cooking to holding offerings during burial ceremonies. Ceremonial pottery was noticeably more delicate and elaborate than pottery for domestic use.&lt;ref name=s65&gt;Seeman, 65&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==
Although there are many techniques and methods of pottery production, the method most likely used in the Hopewell culture was the coiled method. After making the initial form of the vessel a paddle and anvil would then be used to further shape and smooth the pot. The final two steps are decoration and firing.

Before firing, Hopewell pottery was often incised, stamped, or zone-stamped, in which different "zones" of the pot were delineating by incised, then stamped, leaving the surrounding areas smooth for contrast.&lt;ref&gt;Seeman, 64&lt;/ref&gt; "Hopewell ware" is characterized by [[crosshatching]], bands with cambered rims, and highly stylized bird motifs.&lt;ref name=s65/&gt;

'''Ian MacPherson''' (1939 – November 16, 2013)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Balkan|first1=Donna|title=Canadian co-operators mourn death of Ian MacPherson|url=https://www.thenews.coop/40261/topic/history/canadian-co-operators-mourn-death-ian-macpherson-0/|accessdate=September 7, 2017|work=Co-operative News|date=November 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[historian]], and a supporter of the [[co-operative movement]]. MacPherson was born in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]].

==Education==
MacPherson received his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] from the [[University of Windsor]] in 1960. After working as a high school teacher for four years, he returned to school, earning his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] and [[Ph.D.]] degrees in History from the [[University of Western Ontario]].&lt;ref name="bcics-bio"&gt;[http://www.bcics.org/node/141 Dr. Ian MacPherson] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107053044/http://www.bcics.org/node/141 |date=2009-01-07 }}, BCICS Website&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic life==

MacPherson taught at the [[University of Winnipeg]] for 8 years, and founded the [[Canadian Studies]] program there.&lt;ref name = "bcics-bio"/&gt; In 1976, he moved to the History Department at the [[University of Victoria]], serving as Chair from 1981 to 1989. He became Dean of the Faculty of [[Humanities]] in 1992, but stepped down in 1999 to establish the B.C. Institute for Co-operative Studies (BCICS), later renamed the Centre for Co-operative and Community-Based Economy (CCCBE). He retired from BCICS in 2008. From 2005 to 2013 he served as co-director and Principal Investigator of the National Hub of the Canadian Social Economy Research Partnerships.

===Focus of scholarship===
Most of MacPherson's work focused on the Canadian and international co-operative movement, but he also wrote on a nineteenth-century [[Ontario]] family (the Buells of Brockville), [[Canadian Prairie]] rural history, [[urban history]], the history of the [[Northern Canada|Canadian north]], and the history of the University of Victoria. Over the course of his career he wrote, edited or co-edited over twenty books and 190 articles. He also participated in over 300 conference sessions and workshops in more than 70 countries.The main goal of his work was to establish Co-operative Studies as a legitimate and important field of study.

==Involvement with the Co-operative movement==

MacPherson served as an elected leader in numerous [[co-operative]]s, including [[consumers' cooperative]]s in [[Winnipeg]] and Victoria, health co-operatives in Winnipeg and Victoria, a child care co-operative in Victoria, and several [[credit union]]s in Victoria, including [[Coast Capital Savings|Pacific Coast Savings]].&lt;ref name = "bcics-bio"/&gt; He was a member of the [[BC Central Credit Union]] board, the [[Canadian Co-operative Credit Society]], the [[Co-operative Union of Canada]], and the [[International Co-operative Alliance]] (ICA). He was the founding President of the [[Canadian Co-operative Association]] in 1989. As part of his work with the ICA, he led the process and wrote the basic documents for the Co-operative Identity Statement adopted by the ICA at its Manchester Congress in 1995. It included the first internationally accepted definition of a co-operative, a statement of the basic values of the movement, and a revised set of principles for co-operative organisations.&lt;ref name = "bcics-bio"/&gt;

===Awards===
* Rochdale Pioneers Award,  International Co-operative Alliance, 2005 
* Canadian Association for Studies in Co-operation (CASC) – CASC Merit Award 2002

'''Jacopo Bonfadio''' (c. 1508 – July 1550) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Renaissance Humanism|humanist]] and [[historian]]. 

Born in [[Garda (VR)|Garda]], he was educated at [[Verona]] and [[Padua]]. Beginning in 1532, he worked as secretary for various members of the clergy in [[Rome]] and [[Naples]]. In 1540, he gained employment in Padua with the son of [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]]-humanist [[Pietro Bembo]]. While working for Bembo's son, he met and became friends with notable humanists of the time and was a contemporary of [[Annibal Caro]]. He also gained fame from his [[poetry]], which earned him an invitation to teach [[philosophy]] at the [[University of Genoa]] in 1544. While there, he was commissioned to write a history of the [[Republic of Genoa]] since 1528. 

In 1541, Bonfadio, among others, coined the term ''una terza natura'', meaning 'nature improved by art', and subsequently, many designers utilized the concept. Large-scale views of the [[Medici]] villas, the grand vistas of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], and the planning of 16th-century and later [[English country house]]s show how this idea was incorporated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3575/is_1283_215/ai_n6120340 Nature talking with nature]; [[Charles Jencks]]; [[Architectural Review]]; January, 2004; accessed 2008-07-18&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bonfadio's humanist views earned him some powerful enemies in Genoa. In 1550, after he had completed ''Annales Genuendis, ab anno 1528 recuperatae libertatis usque ad annum 1550'' (his history of the Republic of Genoa from 1528 to 1550), his writings angered the powerful Genoese families the Dorias, the Adornos, the Spinolas, and the Fieschi, who sought revenge against him for daring to record and judge their actions. They proceeded to accuse him of [[sodomy]], for which he was arrested, tried, and condemned to death. He was [[Decapitation|beheaded]], and his body was burnt. The minutes of his trial have been lost.

The ''Annales Genuendis'' have been translated into Italian by Paschetti, and a new Latin edition was published at Brescia in 1747.&lt;ref&gt;[http://infomotions.com/etexts/gutenberg/dirs/etext05/7bkft10.htm Books Fatal to Their Authors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210085302/http://infomotions.com/etexts/gutenberg/dirs/etext05/7bkft10.htm |date=2012-02-10 }}; Peter Hampson Ditchfield; accessed 2008-07-18&lt;/ref&gt;
Scholars have had difficulty determining the exact date of his execution. Most official sources report it as having taken place in 1550,&lt;ref name="bon. it" /&gt; while others give the date as 1560, or even as late as 1580, though the latter date has been widely discredited by later scholars.

'''Julio César Chaves''' (November 27, 1907 &amp;ndash; February 20, 1989) was a [[Paraguay]]an historian.&lt;ref&gt;This "Chaves" is spelled with an S, according to the work of [[Augusto Roa Bastos]], "[[I, the Supreme|Yo el supremo]]".&lt;/ref&gt;

He had an important role in the [[Chaco War]], as a disseminator of information and propaganda, and he also worked with the government to carry out important tasks.

==Life==
Born in the city of [[Asunción]], Chaves was one of the core historians of [[Paraguay]] and a transcendental figure of the culture of that country. The work he did gave a major boost to the national historiography.

He belonged to the so-called "Generation 1925", along with other eminent personalities like Efraím Cardozo, Hipolito Sanchez Quell and R. Antonio Ramos. His studies on Doctor [[José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia]] eventually became the book ''The Supreme Dictator'', today regarded as the most comprehensive, objective and serious work on the subject. He was also a professor, diplomat and politician. During the [[Chaco War]] he played a major role in promoting information and media.

He pursued primary and secondary education in San José and at the National College and earned his doctorate in 1929, after defending his thesis on the [[Monroe Doctrine]].

==Family==
Chaves' uncle was Mr. [[Federico Chaves]], who was president between the years 1949 and 1954. His brothers were prominent personalities of national policy, Hugo, Herman and [[Juan Ramon Chaves]]. The latter was president of the [[Colorado Party (Paraguay)|Colorado Party]] for many years. Julio César had membership in the Colorado Party until 1973, when he joined the [[Authentic Radical Liberal Party|Liberal Party]].

==National service==
During the [[Chaco War]], Chaves worked at the "Department II", first under the command of [[Tomás Romero Pereira]] and then as chief until the end of the war.

In 1934, in mid-July, at the express request of President [[Eusebio Ayala]] and General [[José Félix Estigarribia]], Chaves organized (as head of Department II) the Directorate Press and Propaganda (popularly known as Radio Press), which was presented in the form of daily bulletins. This work had a great impact nationally and internationally and served to raise troop morale.

It was also after the war, the civil fiscal year 1936, and deputy national, 1938. At that time he was an active military in the Liberal Youth Club, along with young people such as [[Efraím Cardozo]], Carlos Pastore, Horacio Fernandez, Juan G. Peroni, Villagra Maffiodo Salvador, Francisco Sapena, Emilio Saguier Aceval, Pedro R. Espínola, Paul Max Ynsfrán, Alejandro Marin Churches, Artemio Mereles, Juan B. Wasmosy, among others. This was the group that launched and supported the presidential candidacy of General [[José Félix Estigarribia]] in 1939, imposed on the criterion of liberal old guard who wanted a civilian president.

In 1939, Chaves was sent as minister to [[Bolivia]] and then to [[Peru]] as an ambassador in 1940. With the assumption of General [[Higinio Morínigo]] as president of the republic after the death of Estigarribia, who took exile in [[Buenos Aires]] from the year 1941.

He was perhaps among the more profitable exiles of the country because Chaves began to develop part of his historiography work there.

Chaves was also president of the Academy of Paraguayan History from 1956 to 1973 and again from 1984 to 1986, and the Academia de la Lengua Española from 1975 until his death. He was also president of the PEN Club and the Paraguayan Institute of Hispanic Culture, as well as a member of academies and institutes from various countries, the American Institute of History of Madrid and the Royal Academy of Arts of the Spanish capital. He was a lecturer in various Latin American capitals and major cultural centers of Europe.

==Works==
In 1936 Chaves wrote ''El Chaco in adjustments for peace'' (unpublished), and in 1937 edited ''History of relations between Buenos Aires and Paraguay''.

His other works include:
*''El supremo dictador, Castelli'' (Castelli, the supreme dictator).
*''El adalid de mayo'' (The May Champion).
*''San Martín y Bolívar en Guayaquil'' (San Martín and Bolívar in Guayaquil).
*''El presidente López'' (President López).
*''Vida y obra de Don Carlos'' (Life and work of Don Carlos).
*''El General Díaz'' (General Diaz).
*''Biografía del vencedor de Curupayty'' (Biography of the Curupayty conqueror).
*''Compendio de historia paraguaya'' (Compendium of Paraguayan history).
*''Compendio de historia americana'' (Compendium of American history).
*''Unamuno y América'' (Unamuno and America).
*''Historia del descubrimiento y conquista del Río de la Plata y el Paraguay'' (History of the discovery and conquest of the Rio de la Plata and Paraguay).
*''Itinerario de Antonio Machado'' (Antonio Machado Journey).
*''Túpac Amaru''.
*''La causa de la independencia americana'' (The cause of Latin American independence).

==Publishing==
Dr. Julio Cesar Chaves is the creator of an unpublished monograph, which deals with the important actions that he took in the Chaco War. This is a valuable document on the work that he accomplished in the Department II, his management of ''Prensa y Propaganda'' that depended directly on the Commander in Chief of Army Operations.

Department II was organized by the then mayor [[Tomás Romero Pereira]], supported by Chaves, and its task included military intelligence. ''Prensa y Propaganda'' depended directly on Chaves by express order of president [[Eusebio Ayala]], who mandated him to carry out daily bulletins to counter Bolivian propaganda. According to Chaves himself, these bulletins were captured by the main radiotelegraph stations in the country and the following American countries: [[Bolivia]] [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]] and [[Peru]].

President Ayala wrote the first three materials as a model. The first alluded to the Chilean mercenaries in the Bolivian army, the second to the superiority of the Paraguayan soldiers' morale over the Bolivian, and the third to the resources expended by Bolivia during the Chaco struggles. Bolivian prisoners were very valuable as sources of information for these bulletins, which led to a deterioration in the minds of the enemy combatants’ side, as acknowledged after the war by Colonel [[David Toro]], a prominent Bolivian leader.

==Death==
Chaves died in Asunción on February 20, 1989, a few months after his 81st birthday.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3625">'''Michael Critobulus''' ({{Lang-el|Μιχαήλ Κριτόβουλος}}, c. 1410 &amp;ndash; c. 1470) was a Greek politician, scholar and historian. He is known as the author of a history of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquest of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] under Sultan [[Mehmet II]]. [[Steven Runciman]] included Critobulus' work, along with the writings of [[Doukas (historian)|Doukas]], [[Laonicus Chalcondyles]] and [[George Sphrantzes]], as one of the principal Greek sources for the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453.&lt;ref&gt;Runciman, ''The Conquest of Constantinople: 1453'' (Cambridge: University Press, 1969), pp.192-195&lt;/ref&gt;

Critobulus is a [[Romanization]] of the name, which is alternatively [[Romanization of Greek|transliterated]] as Kritoboulos, Kritovoulos, Critoboulos; sometimes with Critobulus' provenance affixed (e.g. ''Critobulus of Imbros'').

==Biography==
Critobulus' birth name was ''Michael Critopoulos''. He changed this modern Greek family name to the more classical-sounding ''"Kritoboulos"'' in reference to a figure of that name in the dialogues of [[Plato]].

He belonged to a family of landowners on the island of [[Imbros]]. In the 1450s he was a local political leader of the island and played an active role in the peaceful handover of [[Imbros]], [[Limnos]] and [[Thasos]] to the Ottomans after the final breakdown of the Byzantine Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Babinger, Franz. ''Mehmed the Conqueror and His Time'', edited by William C. Hickman and translated by Ralph Manheim (Princeton: University Press, 1978), pp. 97f&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
He later wrote the work ''History'' in five books.&lt;ref name=Antonakos&gt;John Antonakos, ''Noted Greeks Of The Middle Ages'', p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; It is a historical account of the rise of the Ottomans and the final conquest of the remainder of the Eastern Roman Empire. Its main part is a biography of the Ottoman sultan Mehmet II, the Conqueror, to whom the work was also dedicated. Writing under Ottoman rule, Critobulus expressed admiration for Mehmet in his work, and combined  mourning for the Greek loss with an acceptance of the shift of power to the [[Ottoman Turks]], which he interpreted as a divinely ordained world historic event.

In doing so, Critobulus took as a literary model the works of [[Josephus|Flavius Josephus]], the Jewish-Roman historian of the Roman destruction of [[Jerusalem]]. His text is the most detailed historical account of the first decade of Turkish rule in [[Constantinople]], including the Ottoman efforts of rebuilding and repopulating the city. The autograph of his text has been preserved in the Library of the Serail in Istanbul.
He used [[Thucydides]] as a model for his ''History''.&lt;ref name=Antonakos/&gt;

'''Olinda''' ({{IPA-pt|oˈlĩdɐ}}), is a historic city in the [[Brazil]]ian [[States of Brazil|state]] of [[Pernambuco]], located on the country's northeastern [[Atlantic Ocean]] coast, in Greater [[Recife]] (capital of Pernambuco State).&lt;ref name="b"/&gt; It has a population of 389,494 people, covers {{convert|41.681|km2|mi2}}, and has a population of 9 inhabitants per square kilometer. It is noted as one of the best-preserved colonial cities in Brazil.&lt;ref name="ibge2016"/&gt;

Olinda features a number of major tourist attractions, such as a historic downtown area ([[World Heritage Site]]), churches, and the [[Carnival]] of Olinda, a popular street party, very similar to traditional Portuguese carnivals, with the addition of African influenced dances. Unlike in [[Rio de Janeiro]] and [[Salvador, Brazil|Salvador]], in Olinda, admission to Carnival is free. All the festivities are celebrated on the streets, and there are no bleachers or roping. There are hundreds of small musical groups (sometimes featuring a single performer) in many genres.

Several indigenous tribes occupied the coast of Northeastern Brazil for several thousand years, and the hills of the present day municipality of Olinda had settlements of [[Caeté people|Caetés]] and [[Tupinambá people|Tupinambá]] tribes, which were frequently at war. French mercenaries are thought to be the first Europeans to get to the region, but the Portuguese exploited intertribal rivalries and managed to build a stronghold on the former Caeté village in the higher hill. Recent studies by the [[Universidade Federal de Pernambuco]] [Federal University of Pernambuco] have uncovered new evidence of the pre-colonial population of the area. The settlement of Olinda was founded in 1535 by [[Duarte Coelho Pereira]]; it was elevated to a town on March 12, 1537.&lt;ref name="b"/&gt; It was made the seat of the [[Territorial Prelature of Pernambuco]] in 1614, becoming the Diocese of Olinda in 1676. The economy of the region was dominated by the production of [[sugarcane]]. The importation of slaves from Africa to support the economy made Olinda a colonial stronghold. By 1600 its economy was based on sugar, and imported African [[Slavery in Brazil|slave labor]] had made it a colonial stronghold. Slavery existed in Olinda until the [[Lei Áurea]], or Golden Law, abolished slavery in Brazil in 1888.

Olinda was the capital of the hereditary [[captaincy]] of [[Pernambuco]], but was burned by [[Dutch people|Dutch]] invaders. The Portuguese built their town on the hill, for practical purposes (sewers) and to make it easier to defend. In the 17th century the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] was united with Spain (the 1580-1640 [[Iberian Union]] period). Taking advantage of this period of Portuguese weakness, the area around Olinda and [[Recife]] was occupied by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] who gained access to the Portuguese [[sugarcane]] [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|plantation]]s.&lt;ref name="ibge2016"/&gt; [[John Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen]] was appointed as the governor of the Dutch possessions in Brazil in 1637 by the Dutch West India Company on recommendation of Frederick Henry. He landed at [[Recife]], the [[Recife port|port]] of Pernambuco and the chief stronghold of the Dutch, in January 1637. By a series of successful expeditions, he gradually extended the Dutch possessions from Sergipe on the south to São Luís de Maranhão in the north. He likewise conquered the Portuguese possessions of Saint George del Mina, Saint Thomas, and [[Luanda]], Angola, on the west coast of Africa. After the dissolution of the [[Iberian Union]] in 1640, Portugal would reestablish its authority over the lost territories of the [[Portuguese Empire]].

Olinda declined in importance after the Dutch invasion. Recife became the capital of Pernambuco in 1827. The city now serves as a suburb to the greater Recife metropolitan area. Due to the historic position of the city, its Cathedral, a [[World Heritage Site]], São Salvador do Mundo, remains the primary seat of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Olinda e Recife]],&lt;ref name="b"/&gt; with a [[co-cathedral]] in Recife, while Olinda also has a [[Minor Basilica]], again World Heritage Site (Minor): Basílica Abacial do Mosteiro de São Bento de Olinda.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/diocese/olin0.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides its natural beauty, Olinda is also one of Brazil's main cultural centers. Declared in 1982 a Historical and Cultural Patrimony of Humanity by the [[UNESCO]], Olinda relives the magnificence of the past every year during the Rio-style [[Carnival]], on the rhythms of ''[[frevo]]'', ''[[maracatu]]'' and others rhythms.

The main economic activities in Olinda are based in tourism, commerce, transportation industry and artcraft. The tourist sector has a boom every Carnival when thousands of people are in the old historic town center.

'''Pavlos Karolidis''' or '''Karolides''' ({{lang-el|Παύλος Καρολίδης}}, 1849 – 26 July 1930) was one of the most eminent [[Greeks|Greek]] historians of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

== Life ==
[[File:Pavlos Karolidis Greek Professor.JPG|225x|thumb|right|Pavlos Karolidis in his later years]]
Karolidis was born in 1849 in the village of Androniki ({{lang-tr|Endürlük}}, now a suburb of [[Kayseri]]) in [[Cappadocia]]. His father Konstantinos Karolidis or Karloglou was a wealthy landowner and wheat merchant.&lt;ref&gt;Touloumakos (2006), [http://www.ehw.gr/asiaminor/forms/fLemmaBodyExtended.aspx?lemmaid=8721&amp;boithimata_State=&amp;kefalaia_State=#chapter_1 Chapter 1]&lt;/ref&gt; Like most Cappadocian Greeks (see [[Karamanlides]]), Karolidis' mother tongue was [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]], but he was educated at Greek schools, including two of the premier Greek-language institutions of the [[Ottoman Empire]], the [[Great School of the Nation]] in [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] and the [[Evangelical School of Smyrna]]. In 1867 he enrolled  in the School of Philosophy of the [[University of Athens]], and in 1870 he went to Germany on a scholarship. He studied at the universities of [[Munich]], [[Strasbourg]] and [[Tübingen]] and was awarded his doctorate in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;Touloumakos (2006), [http://www.ehw.gr/asiaminor/forms/fLemmaBodyExtended.aspx?lemmaid=8721&amp;boithimata_State=&amp;kefalaia_State=#chapter_2 Chapter 2]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On his return from Germany, he initially taught in the Greek high schools of [[Beyoğlu|Pera]] and [[Chalcedon]]. In 1876 he went to Smyrna to teach at the Evangelical School. There he remained until 1886, when he moved permanently to Athens in the independent [[Kingdom of Greece|Greek kingdom]]. After teaching in a high school for a few months, he was elected assistant professor of General History at the University of Athens. In 1893, he succeeded the dean of modern Greek historians, [[Constantine Paparrigopoulos]], at the chair of Greek History.&lt;ref&gt;Touloumakos (2006), [http://www.ehw.gr/asiaminor/forms/fLemmaBodyExtended.aspx?lemmaid=8721&amp;boithimata_State=&amp;kefalaia_State=#chapter_3 Chapter 3]&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, Karolidis pursued the idea of occupying a new seat for Oriental Studies, where he was more qualified, but his rivalry with [[Spyridon Lambros]] negated this prospect.&lt;ref name="EHW3.2"&gt;Touloumakos (2006), [http://www.ehw.gr/asiaminor/forms/fLemmaBodyExtended.aspx?lemmaid=8721&amp;boithimata_State=&amp;kefalaia_State=#chapter_5 Chapter 3.2]&lt;/ref&gt;

As he was still an Ottoman citizen, in 1908 Karolidis was [[Ottoman legislative election, 1908|elected]] to the [[Ottoman Parliament]]. His independent-mindedness during his tenure, especially with regards to his ardent anti-Slavic feelings and his hopes for a Greco-Turkish rapprochement, alienated him from the Greek authorities and those Ottoman Greeks who aligned themselves with the policies of the Greek kingdom.&lt;ref name="Politics"&gt;Touloumakos (2006), [http://www.ehw.gr/asiaminor/forms/fLemmaBodyExtended.aspx?lemmaid=8721&amp;boithimata_State=&amp;kefalaia_State=#chapter_6 Chapter 3.3]&lt;/ref&gt; Disappointed, Karolidis initially thought to return to Athens and resume his university post, but in the event he was convinced to run as a candidate for the [[Committee of Union and Progress]], the party of the [[Young Turks]]. This was seen as tantamount to treason by the nationalist Greek press, with rumours even spreading that he had converted to Islam. Karolidis was elected to the Parliament and remained in Constantinople until September 1912. As war between the Ottoman Empire and the [[Balkan League]], to which Greece had acceded in May, became inevitable, he left for Germany. He returned to Greece only towards the end of the [[First Balkan War]] in May 1913.&lt;ref name="Politics"/&gt;

Karolidis resumed his teaching at the University of Athens only in September 1915. A convinced royalist, he supported King [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine I]] during the [[National Schism]], a fact which cost him his post following the victory of [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] and the king's abdication in June 1917. He was reinstated in early 1921, after Venizelos' [[Greek legislative election, 1920|electoral defeat]], and kept his post until he was pensioned off in 1923. His political leanings changed abruptly in this period, following the [[Asia Minor Disaster]], and he became fiercely critical towards the [[Greek monarchy]]. He died in Athens on 26 July 1930.&lt;ref name="EHW3.4"&gt;Touloumakos (2006), [http://www.ehw.gr/asiaminor/forms/fLemmaBodyExtended.aspx?lemmaid=8721&amp;boithimata_State=&amp;kefalaia_State=#chapter_7 Chapter 3.4]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Works ==
[[File:Pavlos Karolidis signature.jpg|thumb|right|His signature]]
Karolidis's initial research, during the 1870s and 1880s, was focused on his home region of Cappadocia, with the publication of ''Kappadokika, a historical and archaeological dissertation on Cappadocia'' in 1874 and his studies on the city of [[Comana (Cappadocia)|Comana]] and the [[Cappadocian Greek]] dialect published in 1882 and 1885 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Touloumakos (2006), [http://www.ehw.gr/asiaminor/forms/fLemmaBodyExtended.aspx?lemmaid=8721&amp;boithimata_State=&amp;kefalaia_State=#chapter_4 Chapter 3.1]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although an eminent Orientalist, after his appointment to the University of Athens Karolidis largely neglected the field and instead turned to Greek and general history, in conformity with the chairs he held. He published 18 books and 38 articles in the period 1893–1908, including his three volume ''History of the 19th Century'', a three volume-work (plus the introductory ''Introduction'') which focuses on Greece, and his unfinished ''Universal or World History'', only four of whose projected ten volumes were completed. The latter work is of particular importance as it was one of the rare studies on the [[historical method]] written in Greek until then. He is also notable as the editor of the revised edition of Paparrigopoulos' ''History of the Greek Nation'', published in 1902–1903.&lt;ref name="EHW3.2"/&gt;

The period after the [[Balkan Wars]] was not very productive for Karolidis, but after 1922 he produced some of his most famous works, dealing with the post-[[Byzantine]] period of Greek history ([[Ottoman Greece]] and [[Modern Greece]]): the seven-volume ''Contemporary History'' (1922–1929) and the ''History of Greece'' (1925). The eighth volume of the ''Contemporary History'' was eventually published in 1932, incorporated in the sixth edition of Paparrigopoulos' ''History of the Greek Nation''.&lt;ref name="EHW3.4"/&gt;

The '''Pax Romana''' ([[Latin]] for "Roman Peace") was a long period of [[golden age|relative peace and stability]] experienced by the [[Roman Empire]] between the accession of [[Caesar Augustus]], founder of the [[Roman principate]], and the death of [[Marcus Aurelius]], last of the [[five good emperors|"good emperors"]].&lt;ref
 name=EncBrit&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/447447/Pax-Romana |title=Pax Romana |publisher=Britannica Online Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since it was inaugurated by Augustus with the end of the [[Final War of the Roman Republic]], it is sometimes called the '''Pax Augusta'''. During this period of approximately 206 years (27 BC to AD 180), the Roman empire achieved its greatest territorial extent and its population reached a maximum of up to 70 million people – a third of the world’s population.&lt;ref name=ushistory/&gt; According to [[Cassius Dio]], the dictatorial reign of [[Commodus]], later followed by the [[Year of the Five Emperors]] and the [[crisis of the third century]], marked the descent "from a kingdom of gold to one of iron and rust". &lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius  [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/72*.html#36 72.36.4], Loeb edition translated E.

The Pax Romana is said to have been a "[[miracle]]" because prior to it there had never been peace for so many centuries in a given period of history. However, [[Walter Goffart]] wrote: "The volume of the [[The Cambridge Ancient History|''Cambridge Ancient History'']] for the years A.D. 70–192 is called 'The Imperial Peace', but peace is not what one finds in its pages".&lt;ref name="Goffart1989"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=55pDIwvWnpoC&amp;pg=PA111|title=Rome's Fall and After|publisher=Hambledon Press|year=1989|isbn=978-1-85285-001-2|pages=111|author=Walter Goffart}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur M. Eckstein writes that the period must be seen in contrast to the much more frequent warfare in the [[Roman Republic]] in the 4th and 3rd centuries BC. Eckstein also notes that the incipient Pax Romana appeared during the Republic, and that its temporal span varied with geographical region as well: "Although the standard textbook dates for the Pax Romana, the famous “Roman Peace” in the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]], are 31 BC to AD 250, the fact is that the Roman Peace was emerging in large regions of the Mediterranean at a much earlier date: [[Sicily]] after 210 [BC], the [[Italian Peninsula]] after 200 [BC]; the [[Po Valley]] after 190 [BC]; most of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] after 133 [BC]; [[North Africa]] after 100 [BC]; and for ever longer stretches of time in the [[Greek East and Latin West|Greek East]]."&lt;ref name="RosensteinMorstein-Marx2011"&gt;{{cite book|editors=Nathan Rosenstein and Robert Morstein-Marx|title=A Companion to the Roman Republic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C4rmmvFAKjoC&amp;pg=PA574|origyear=2006|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-5720-2|page=574|chapter=Conceptualizing Roman Imperial Expansion under the Republic: An Introduction|author=
Arthur M. Eckstein}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known record of the term ''Pax Romana'' appears in a writing by [[Seneca the Younger]] in 55 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ali Parchami|title=Hegemonic Peace and Empire: The Pax Romana, Britannica and Americana|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pwt6AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA25|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-00704-2|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was highly influential, and the subject of theories and attempts to copy it in subsequent ages. [[Arnaldo Momigliano]] noted that "''Pax Romana'' is a simple formula for [[propaganda]], but a difficult subject for research."&lt;ref name="Momi"/&gt; In fact, the "Pax Romana" was broken by the [[First Jewish–Roman War]], the [[Kitos War]] (also in Judea, 115–117), the [[Bar Kokhba revolt|Bar Kokhba Revolt]] (also known as the Third Jewish–Roman War), the [[Roman–Parthian War of 58–63]], Trajan's [[Trajan|Roman–Parthian War]] of 113, the [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|Dacian Wars]], various battles with Germanic tribes, including the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest|Teutoburg Forest]], and [[Boudica]]'s war in Britain in AD 60 or 61.

The Pax Romana began when Octavian (Augustus) defeated [[Mark Antony]] and [[Cleopatra]] in the [[Battle of Actium]] on 2 September 31 BC and became Roman emperor.&lt;ref name=EncBrit/&gt;&lt;ref name=Battles&gt;{{cite book |first=Paul K. |last=Davis |authorlink=Paul K.

Lacking a good precedent of successful one-man rule, Augustus created a [[Military junta|junta]] of the greatest military magnates and stood as the front man. By binding together these leading magnates in a coalition, he eliminated the prospect of [[civil war]]. The Pax Romana was not immediate, despite the end of the civil wars, because fighting continued in [[Hispania]] and in the [[Alps]]. Nevertheless, Augustus closed the [[Gates of Janus]] (a ceremony indicating that Rome was at peace) three times,&lt;ref&gt;Augustus states in ''Res Gestae'' 13 that he closed the Gates three times, a fact documented by many other historians (See [[Gates of Janus]]).&lt;/ref&gt; first in 29 BC and again in 25 BC. The third closure is undocumented, but [[Inez Scott Ryberg]] (1949) and Gaius Stern (2006) have persuasively dated the third closure to 13 BC with the commissioning of the [[Ara Pacis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.jstor.org/pss/4238621 |url-access=subscription |title=The Procession of the Ara Pacis |first=Inez |last=Scott Ryberg |authorlink=Inez Scott Ryberg |journal=Memoirs of the American Academy in Rome |volume=19 |year=1949 |pages=77,79–101 |doi=10.2307/4238621}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stern&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Women_children_and_senators_on_the_Ara_P.html?id=agPYfLmueWEC&amp;redir_esc=y |title=Women, children, and senators on the Ara Pacis Augustae: A study of Augustus' vision of a new world order in 13 BCE. |first=Gaius |last=Stern |publisher=ProQuest |year=2010 |origyear=2006 |isbn=978-0-549-83411-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sir [[Ronald Syme]] had suggested a later date (but Rome was then at war).&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time of the [[Ludi Saeculares]] in 17 BC the Concept of Peace was publicised, and in 13 BC was proclaimed when Augustus and [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]] jointly returned from pacifying the provinces. The order to construct the Ara Pacis was no doubt part of this announcement.

Augustus faced a problem making peace an acceptable mode of life for the [[Demography of the Roman Empire|Romans]], who had been at war with one power or another continuously for 200 years.&lt;ref name=Stern/&gt; Romans regarded peace not as an absence of war, but the rare situation which existed when all opponents had been beaten down and lost the ability to resist.&lt;ref name="Momi"&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=750454 |title=The Peace of the Ara Pacis |first=Arnaldo |last=Momigliano | journal=Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes |volume=5 |year=1942 |pages=228–231 |doi=10.2307/750454 |url=https://people.exeter.ac.uk/jda208/The%20Peace%20of%20the%20Ara%20Pacis.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Augustus' challenge was to persuade Romans that the prosperity they could achieve in the absence of warfare was better for the Empire than the potential wealth and honor acquired when fighting a risky war. Augustus succeeded by means of skillful propaganda. [[List of Roman emperors|Subsequent emperors]] followed his lead, sometimes producing lavish ceremonies to close the Gates of Janus, issuing coins with Pax on the reverse, and patronizing literature extolling the benefits of the Pax Romana.&lt;ref name=Stern/&gt;

After Augustus' death in 14 AD, most of his successors as Roman emperors continued his politics.  The last five emperors of the Pax Romana were considered the "[[Five Good Emperors]]".&lt;ref name=ushistory/&gt;

==Influence on trade==
Roman trade in the Mediterranean increased during the Pax Romana.  Romans sailed East to acquire silks, gems, onyx and spices.  Romans benefited from large profits and incomes in the Roman empire were raised due to trade in the Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/784708336|title=The Roman market economy|last=Temin|first=Peter|date=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=|isbn=9780691147680|location=Princeton|pages=13|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/941874968|title=Pax Romana : war, peace, and conquest in the Roman world|last=Goldsworthy|first=Adrian Keith|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2016|isbn=9780300178821|location=New Haven|pages=392|oclc=941874968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example, the [[German Empire]]'s imperial peace of 1871 (over its internal components like [[Saxony]]) slowly evolved into the later German state. As a counter-example, the imperial peace of [[Alexander the Great]]'s empire dissolved because the Greek [[city states]] maintained their political identity and more importantly, embryos of their own armed forces. [[Raymond Aron|Aron]] notes that during the Pax Romana, the [[First Jewish–Roman War|Jewish war]] was a reminder that the overlapping of the imperial institutions over the local ones did not erase them and the overlap was a source of tension and flare-ups. Aron summarizes that, "In other words, ''imperial peace'' becomes civil peace insofar as the memory of the previously independent political units are effaced, insofar as individuals within a pacified zone feel themselves less united to the traditional or local community and more to the conquering state."&lt;ref name="Aron2003"/&gt;

The concept of Pax Romana was highly influential, and attempts to  imitate it occurred in the [[Byzantine Empire]], and in the [[Christian West]], where it morphed into the [[Peace and Truce of God]] (''pax Dei'' and ''treuga Dei'').&lt;ref name="Gress"/&gt; A theoretician of the imperial peace during the Middle Ages was [[Dante Aligheri]]. Dante's works on the topic were analyzed at the beginning of the 20th century by [[William Mitchell Ramsay]] in the book ''The Imperial Peace; An Ideal in European History'' (1913).&lt;ref name="Scott2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[James Brown Scott]]|title=Law, the State, and the International Community|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o2ItplkkogIC&amp;pg=PA223|year=2002|publisher=The Lawbook Exchange, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-58477-178-4|pages=223–224|origyear=1939}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/imperialpeaceide00ramsrich|title=The imperial peace; an ideal in European history|work=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Plekhanov House''' forms part of the [[Russian National Library]] in [[St Petersburg|St. Petersburg]]. It includes 72 archives of materials dating back to 1799. The materials include the archives and library of [[Georgi Plekhanov]], a prominent figure in the Russian political history as a propagandist of [[Marxism]] and the founder of Russian social democratic movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Trotsky|last=Renton|first=Dave|publisher=Haus Publishing|year=2004|isbn=978-1904341628|location=London|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also included the manuscripts of- and about numerous other figures in Russian history, politics and intellectual life.

Plekhanov House contains a large collection of materials on Russian and foreign history, on the Russian and international revolutionary movements and social history, on education, culture, secular and religious education, and so on. It includes collections of a number of authors from Russian history and from theological sources. The heart of the collection, however, is the over 5,000 items of storage that include original materials from Plekhanov's own collection.

Over the years, Plekhanov House has published a number of works including the 24 volumes of Plekhanov's ''Collected Works'', a 5 volume set of ''Selected Philosophical Works'', and other works.

==History==
After Georgi Plekhanov's death in 1918, the Soviet government, at the initiative of [[Vladimir Lenin]], went to Rosalie Plekhanova with a proposal to start publishing the works of her late husband and set up an Archive. It was only in 1925 that Rosalie Plekhanova agreed to this proposal and presented the thinker's library of works and archive to the Soviet Union after refusing various individuals and research institutions, like [[Musée Social]] and Institut des Études Slaves, that offered to acquire or temporary house his collections in Prague or in some West European archive institution.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nlr.ru/eng/coll/manuscripts/plekhanov/|title=The National Library of Russia: The Plekhanov House|last=Russia|first=The National Library of|website=nlr.ru|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plekhanov has resided in [[Switzerland]] and [[Italy]] from 1880 until 1917 and [[Finland]], where he died in 1918, and parts of his collection, which included authentic manuscripts, extensive correspondence, and voluminous library, were temporarily accommodated by institutions in [[Geneva]] and [[Sanremo|San Remo]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is not clear if his wife's reticence was due to Plekhanov's differences with Lenin&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Russia: A Reference Guide from the Renaissance to the Present|last=Borrero|first=Mauricio|publisher=Facts on File, Inc.|year=2004|isbn=978-0816044542|location=New York|pages=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Bolsheviks. Rosalie Plekhanova maintained that she regarded the archives and library as relics of her husband's work but finally entrusted all his possessions to the state for purposes of the promotion and dissemination of his works. According to Plekhanov House:&lt;blockquote&gt;
Plekhanov had always considered the Petersburg Public Library as his "Alma Mater", a spiritual source of theoretical and practical knowledge he resorted to during the early stages of his scholarly and revolutionary activities. Plekhanov's heirs presented his archives and private library together with the furniture of his study in Geneva to the Soviet Union on the condition of integral hold in the Public Library in Leningrad as an organizational unit in a separate area with specialized research staff.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The opening ceremony of Plekhanov House took place on 11 June 1929, following the donation of the archives and library of [[Georgi Plekhanov]] by his widow, Rosalie Plekhanova, to the [[Soviet Union]] in 1925. As noted in the ''Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science, "''It was organized and headed by Rosalia Plekhanov-Bograd, the widow of the founder of Russian Marxism, and immediately became the most important centre of the scholarly analysis of the theoretical legacy left by that prominent thinker.

The '''Scottish Redundant Churches Trust''' is a [[Charitable trust|registered charity]] founded in 1996 which looks after Scottish [[church (building)|church]]es which are of outstanding historic or architectural significance but are [[Redundant church|no longer used for regular worship]]. The Trust receives funding from [[Historic Scotland]] and public donations. Funding for restoration of churches in Trust ownership is received from the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]], [[Historic Scotland]], the Listed Places of Worship Grant Scheme, the Scottish Churches Architectural Heritage Trust, and other trusts and public donations.&lt;ref name=eastchurch&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.eastchurchcromarty.co.uk/ | title = East Church Cromarty | accessdate = 18 February 2011| publisher = eastchurchcromarty.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Trust conserves and repairs all of the churches in its care and runs a range of projects to encourage greater public enjoyment and understanding of historic churches.  Many of its buildings are used for community, arts and educational activities.  All remain as places of worship and occasional services are held.

The Trust presently maintains seven properties throughout Scotland: St Peter's Church, [[Sandwick, Orkney|Sandwick]] in [[Orkney]] (acquired 1998),&lt;ref name=sandwick&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.scotlandschurchestrust.org.uk/church/st-peters-sandwick-orkney | title = St Peter, Orkney | accessdate = 26 February 2013| publisher = Scotland's Churches Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cromarty East Church in [[Ross-shire]] (acquired 1998), [[Pettinain]] Church in [[Lanarkshire]] (acquired 2000), [[Tibbermore]] Church in [[Perthshire]] (acquired 2001), [[Benholm]] Kirk, [[Kincardineshire]] (acquired 2006), [[Kildrummy]] Kirk (acquired 2009), and St Margaret's Church, [[Braemar]] (acquired 2013).&lt;ref name=conservation&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.buildingconservation.com/articles/churchtrusts/churchtrusts.htm| title = Church Trusts| accessdate = 18 February 2011| publisher = Building Conservation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=margaret&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.srct.org.uk/index.php/projects/current-projects/st-margaret-s-church-braemar |title=Projects: St Margaret’s Church, Braemar |publisher=Scottish Redundant Churches Trust |accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|Formerly [[Church of Scotland]], the kirk was founded in the late 16th century but the building dates largely from the 18th century. The north aisle was added 1739 to create a T-plan church with further alterations in 1756 and 1798. The interior dates from the 18th century with several galleries added in the decades afterwards, most notably in 1756. The church was acquired by the SRCT in 1996, and was restored after being a finalist in the BBC ''[[Restoration Village]]'' series. Following this exposure, it was awarded a major grant in 2007 when the Heritage Lottery Fund, Historic Scotland and The Highland Council paid for a £1.3 million restoration.&lt;ref name=eastchurch/&gt;

|Former Church of Scotland parish church of 1805 set in open countryside and a prominent landmark on the Huntly to Banchory road. Adjoining it, on a raised mound, are the remains of the former medieval parish church of St Bride. The kirk is almost square in plan with a semicircular bay containing the gallery stair and entrance. Construction is of dressed rubble with pinnings and cherry cocking under a piend slate roof. The roof is a particularly fine feature of the building, combined with the ball finialed square domed bellcote. The two large Gothic tracery windows on the east wall flood the interior with light. The pulpit is placed between them and surrounded by plain wooden pews and a horseshoe gallery on square columns. The furnishings probably date from 1845-50.

{{No footnotes|article|date=February 2015}}
'''Supposition theory''' was a branch of [[medieval]] logic that was probably aimed at giving accounts of issues similar to modern accounts of [[reference]], [[plural]]ity, [[Grammatical tense|tense]], and [[Linguistic modality|modality]], within an [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] context.  Philosophers such as [[John Buridan]], [[William of Ockham]], [[William of Sherwood]], [[Walter Burley]], [[Albert of Saxony (philosopher)|Albert of Saxony]], and [[Peter of Spain (author)|Peter of Spain]] were its principal developers.  By the 14th century it seems to have drifted into at least two fairly distinct theories, the theory of "supposition proper" which included an "[[ampliation]]" and is much like a theory of reference, and the theory of "modes of supposition" whose intended function is not clear.

==Supposition proper==
Supposition was a semantic relation between a term and what it is being used to talk about.
So, for example, in the suggestion ''Drink another cup'' the term ''cup'' is suppositing for the wine contained in the cup.

The logical ''suppositum'' of a term was the object the term referred to.  (In grammar, ''suppositum'' was used in a different way).  However, supposition was a different semantic relationship than signification.  Signification was a conventional relationship between utterances and objects mediated by the particularities of a language. ''Poculum'' signifies in [[Latin]], what ''cup'' signifies in [[English language|English]]. Signification is the imposition of a meaning on an utterance, but supposition is taking a meaningful term as standing in for something.  According to Peter of Spain "Hence signification is prior to supposition.  Neither do they belong to the same thing.  For to signify belongs to an utterance, but to supposit belongs to a term already, as it were, put together out of an utterance and a signification."  An easy way to see the difference is in our ''drink another cup'' example.  Here ''cup'' as an utterance signifies a cup as an object, but ''cup'' as a term of the language English is being used to supposit for the wine contained in the cup.

Medieval logicians divided supposition into many different kinds, and the jargons for the different kinds, and their relations and what they all mean get complex, and differ greatly from logician to logician.&lt;ref&gt;Marcia L. Colish (1976) ''Medieval Foundations of the Western intellectual Tradition'', pages 275,6, [[Yale University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Paul Spade's webpage has a series of helpful diagrams here.  The most important division is probably between material, simple, personal, and improper supposition.  A term supposits materially, when it is used to stand in for an utterance or inscription, rather than for what it signifies.  When I say ''Cup is a monosyllabic word,'' I am using the word ''cup'' to supposit materially for the utterance ''cup'' rather than for a piece of pottery.  Material supposition is a medieval way of doing the work we would do today by using quotation marks.  According to Ockham (''Summa of Logic'' I64, 8) "Simple supposition occurs when a term supposits for an intention of the soul, but is not take significatively."  The idea is that simple supposition happens when the term is standing in for a human concept rather than for the object itself.  If I say ''Cups are an important type of pottery'' the term ''cups'' is not standing in for any particular cup, but for the idea of a cup in the human mind (according to Ockham, and many medieval logicians, but not according to John Buridan).  Personal supposition in contrast is when the term supposits for what it signifies.  If I say ''Pass me the cup'' the term ''cup'' is standing in for the object that is called a ''cup'' in English, so it is in personal supposition.  A term is in improper supposition, if it is suppositing for an object, but a different object than it signifies, as in my example ''Drink another cup.''

==Modes of supposition==
Personal supposition was further divided in types such as discrete, determinate, merely confused, and confused and distributive.  In 1966 T.K. Scott proposed giving a separate name for Medieval discussions of the subvarieties of personal supposition, because he thought it was a fairly distinct issue from the other varieties of supposition.  He proposed calling the subvarieties of personal supposition a theory of "modes of supposition."&lt;ref&gt;Scott, T.K (1966). ''Introduction to Buridan: Sophisms on Meaning and Truth'',  [[Appleton-Century-Crofts]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Medieval logicians give elaborate sets of syntactical rules for determining when a term supposits discretely, determinately, confusedly, or confusedly and distributively.  So for example the subject of a negative claim, or indefinite one supposits determinately, but the subject of a singular claim supposits discretely, while the subject of an affirmative claim supposits confusedly and determinately.  [[Albert of Saxony (philosopher)|Albert of Saxony]] gives 15 rules for determining which type of personal supposition a term is using.  Further the medieval logicians did not seem to dispute about the details of the syntactic rules for determining type of personal supposition.  These rules seem to be important because they were linked to theories of descent to particulars and ascent from particulars.

When I say ''I want to buy a cup'' I've made an indefinite affirmative claim, with ''cup'' as the predicate term.  Further cup is a common term, including many particular cups within it.  So if I "descend to particulars" I can re-phrase my claim as ''I want to buy this cup or I want to buy that cup, or I want to buy that other cup - and so on for all cups.''  If I had an infinite disjunction of all particular cups, it could stand in for the term cup, in its simple supposition in ''I want to buy a cup.''  This is called determinate supposition.  That is when I say ''I want to buy a cup'' I mean some determinate cup, but I don't necessarily know which one yet.  Likewise if I say ''Some cup isn't a table,'' I could substitute ''This cup isn't a table, or that cup isn't a table or ...''

On the other hand, if I say ''No cup is a table'', I don't mean ''This cup isn't a table or that one isn't a table or ...'' I mean ''This cup isn't a table, AND that cup isn't a table, AND that other cup isn't a table, AND ...''.  Here I am referring not to a determinate particular cup, but to all cups "fused" together, that is all cups "confusedly."  This is called confused and distributive supposition.

If I say ''This cup is made of gold'' I cannot descend to a disjunction of particulars, or to a conjunction of particulars, but only because ''this cup'' is already a particular.  This kind of personal supposition is called discrete supposition.

However, the predicate of a universal affirmative claim won't really fit any of these models.  ''All coffee cups are cups'' does not imply ''All coffee cups are this cup, or all coffee cups are that cup, or ...'', but still less does it imply ''All coffee cups are this cup, and all coffee cups are that cup, and ...''.  On the other hand, if it happened to be the case that there was only one coffee cup left in the world, it would be true that ''All coffee cups are that cup'', so I can validly infer from ''All coffee cups are that cup'', to ''All coffee cups are cups''.  Here descent to disjunction fails, and descent to conjunction fails, but "ascent from particulars" is valid.  This is called "merely confused supposition."

That is basically how the theory works, a much thornier problem is exactly what the theory is for.  Some commentators, like Michael Loux,&lt;ref&gt;Loux, Michael (1974). ''Ockham on Generality'' in ''Ockham's Theory of Terms'', [[University of Notre Dame Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that the theory of ascent and descent to particulars is intended to provide truth conditions for the quantifiers. T. K. Scott has suggested that the theory of supposition proper was designed to answer the question ''What kind of thing are you talking about?'' but the theory of personal supposition was aimed at answering the question ''How many of them are you talking about?''  Paul Spade has suggested that by the 14th century the theory of modes of personal supposition wasn't aimed at anything at all anymore.

==Ampliation==
When I say ''No cups are made of lead'', ''cups'' supposits for all the cups that exist.  But if I say ''Some cups were made of lead in Roman times'', ''cups'' cannot just be suppositing for all the cups that exist, but for cups in the past as well.  Here I am expanding the normal supposition of the terms I use.  [[Peter of Spain]] says "Ampliation is the extension of a common term from a lesser supposition to a greater one."&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Copenhaver]], [[Calvin Normore]] &amp; [[Terence Parsons]] (2014) ''Peter of Spain Summaries of Logic'', Text, Translation, Introduction, and Notes, [[Oxford University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, if I speak of the past, or the future, or make a modal claim, the terms I use get ampliated to supposit for past things, future things, or possible things, rather than their usual supposition for present actual things.  Thus, ampliation becomes the medieval theory for explaining modal and tense logics within the theory of supposition.

'''Thebes''' ({{lang-grc|Θῆβαι}}, ''Thēbai''), known to the [[ancient Egypt]]ians as '''Waset''', was an [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[list of ancient Egyptian sites|city]] located east of the [[Nile]] about {{convert|800|km|sp=us}} south of the [[Mediterranean]]. Its ruins lie within the modern [[Egypt]]ian [[list of Egyptian cities|city]] of [[Luxor]]. Thebes was the main city of the fourth Upper Egyptian [[Nome (Egypt)|nome]] (Sceptre nome) and was the capital of Egypt mainly during the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] and the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]]. It was close to [[Nubia]] and the [[Eastern Desert]], with its valuable mineral resources and trade routes. It was a [[Theban Triad|cult center]] and the most venerated city of ancient Egypt during its heyday. The site of Thebes includes areas on both the eastern bank of the Nile, where the temples of [[Karnak]] and [[Luxor Temple|Luxor]] stand and the city proper was situated; and the western bank, where a [[Theban Necropolis|necropolis]] of large private and royal cemeteries and funerary complexes can be found.

The [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] name for Thebes was ''wꜣs.t'', "City of the [[was-sceptre|''wꜣs'']]", the [[sceptre]] of the [[pharaoh]]s, a long staff with an animal's head and a forked base. From the end of the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]], Thebes was known in Egyptian as {{nowrap|''niwt-'imn''}}, the "City of [[Amun]]", the chief of the [[Theban Triad]] of deities whose other members were [[Mut]] and [[Khonsu]]. This name of Thebes appears in the [[Bible]] as the {{nowrap|"Nōʼ ʼĀmôn"}} ({{lang|he|נא אמון}}) in the [[Book of Nahum]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Nahum 3:8]].&lt;/ref&gt; and also as "No" ({{lang|he|נא}}) mentioned in the [[Book of Ezekiel]]&lt;ref&gt;Ezekiel 30:14–16.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah 46:25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huddlestun, John R. “Nahum, Nineveh, and the Nile: The Description of Thebes in Nahum 3:8–9.” Journal of Near Eastern Studies, vol. 62, no. 2, 2003, pp. 97–98.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thebes is the [[latinisation of names|latinised]] form of {{lang-grc-koi|Θῆβαι}}, the [[Hellenization|hellenized]] form of the [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic Egyptian]] ''ta Pe'', from earlier ''ta Opet''. This was the local name not for the city itself but for the [[Karnak]] temple complex on the northeast bank of the city. As early as [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Iliad'', IV.406 and IX.383.&lt;/ref&gt; the Greeks distinguished the Egyptian Thebes as {{nowrap|"Thebes of the Hundred Gates"}} ({{lang|grc|Θῆβαι ἑκατόμπυλοι}}, ''Thēbai hekatómpyloi'') or "Hundred-Gated Thebes", as opposed to the "[[Thebes, Greece|Thebes of the Seven Gates]]" ({{lang|grc|Θῆβαι ἑπτάπυλοι}}, ''Thēbai heptapyloi'') in [[Boeotia]], Greece.{{refn|group=n|[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] records that owing to its "connection" with the Egyptian city, the Boeotian Thebes also had an idol and temple of Amun from the 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;''Description of Greece'', IX.16 §1.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the ''[[interpretatio graeca]]'', Amun was rendered as [[Zeus Ammon]]. The name was therefore translated into Greek as Diospolis, "City of Zeus". To distinguish it from the numerous other cities by this name, it was known as the {{nowrap|"Great Diospolis"}} ({{lang|grc|Διόσπολις Μεγάλη}}, ''Dióspolis Megálē''; {{lang-la|Diospolis Magna}}). The Greek names came into wider use after the conquest of Egypt by [[Alexander the Great]], when the country came to be ruled by the [[Ancient Macedonia|Macedonian]] [[Ptolemaic dynasty]].

==Characteristics==
===Geography===
Thebes was located along the banks of the [[Nile River|Nile]] River in the middle part of [[Upper Egypt]] about 800&amp;nbsp;km from the [[Nile Delta|Delta]]. It was built largely on the [[alluvial plains]] of the [[Nile Valley]] which follows a great bend of the Nile. As a natural consequence, the city was laid in a northeast-southwest axis parallel to the contemporary river channel. Thebes had an area of 93&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (36 sq mi) which included parts of the Theban Hills in the west that culminates at the sacred 420-meter (1,378-foot) [[al-Qurn]]. In the east lies the mountainous [[Eastern Desert]] with its [[wadi]]s draining into the valley. Significant among these wadis is [[Wadi Hammamat]] near Thebes. It was used as an overland trade route going to the [[Red Sea]] coast.

In the fourth Upper Egyptian [[Nome (Egypt)|nome]], Thebes was found to have neighboring towns such as [[Gebelein|Per-Hathor]], [[Medamud|Madu]], [[El-Tod|Djerty]], [[Hermonthis|Iuny]], [[Sumenu|Sumenu and Imiotru]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, T. (2013). "The Rise and Fall of Ancient Egypt". Erenow. Retrieved 2016-02-25, from http://www.erenow.com/ancient/theriseandfallofancientegypt/8.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demographics===
[[File:Thebes historical population.png|thumb|left|Population of Thebes from 2000-900 BC]]
According to [[George Modelski]], Thebes had about 40,000 inhabitants in 2000 BC (compared to 60,000 in [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], the largest city of the world at the time). By 1800 BC, the population of Memphis was down to about 30,000, making Thebes the largest city in Egypt at the time.&lt;ref&gt;George Modelski, "[https://faculty.washington.edu/modelski/WCITI2.html Cities of the Ancient World: An Inventory (−3500 to −1200)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519232105/https://faculty.washington.edu/modelski/WCITI2.html |date=2014-05-19 }}"; see also [[list of largest cities throughout history]].&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Ian Morris (historian)|Ian Morris]] estimated that by 1500 BC, Thebes may have grown to be the largest city in the world, with a population of about 75,000, a position which it held until about 900 BC, when it was surpassed by [[Nimrud]] (among others).&lt;ref&gt;Ian Morris, "[http://www.ianmorris.org/docs/social-development.pdf Social Development] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726164950/http://www.ianmorris.org/docs/social-development.pdf |date=2011-07-26 }}"; see also [[list of largest cities throughout history]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economy===
The archaeological remains of Thebes offer a striking testimony to Egyptian civilization at its height.  The Greek poet [[Homer]] extolled the wealth of Thebes in the ''[[Iliad]]'', Book 9 (c. 8th Century BC): "... in Egyptian Thebes the heaps of precious ingots gleam, the hundred-gated Thebes."{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Culture===
More than sixty annual festivals were celebrated in Thebes. The major festivals among these according to the Edfu Geographical Text were: the [[Opet Festival|Beautiful Feast of Opet]], the Khoiak (Festival), Festival of I [[Shemu]], and Festival of II Shemu. Another popular festivity was the halloween-like [[Beautiful Festival of the Valley]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==History==
===Old Kingdom===
[[File:SFEC AEH -ThebesNecropolis-2010-FULL-Overview-039.jpg|thumb|The Theban Necropolis]]
Thebes was inhabited from around 3200 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancient-wisdom.co.uk/egyptkarnak.htm Karnak (Thebes), Egypt]. Ancient-wisdom.co.uk. Retrieved on 2013-07-29.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the eponymous capital of Waset, the fourth [[Upper Egypt]]ian [[Nome (Egypt)|nome]]. At this time it was still a small trading post while [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] served as the royal residence of [[Old Kingdom]] pharaohs. Although no buildings survive in Thebes older than the portions of the Karnak temple complex, which may date from the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]], the lower part of a statue of Pharaoh [[Nyuserre Ini|Nyuserre]] of the [[5th Dynasty]] has been found in Karnak. Another statue which was dedicated by the [[12th Dynasty]] king Senusret may have been usurped and re-used, since the statue bears a cartouche of Nyuserre on its belt. Since seven rulers of the [[Fourth Dynasty of Egypt|4th]] to [[Sixth Dynasty of Egypt|6th]] Dynasties appear on the Karnak king list, perhaps at the least there was a temple in the Theban area which dated to the Old Kingdom.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/thebes.htm Egypt: Thebes, A Feature Tour Egypt Story]. http://www.touregypt.net/. Retrieved on 2016-02-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First Intermediate Period===
By 2160 BC, a new line of pharaohs (the [[Ninth Dynasty of Egypt|Ninth]] and [[Tenth Dynasty of Egypt|Tenth]] Dynasties) consolidated [[Lower Egypt]] and northern parts of [[Upper Egypt]] from their capital in [[Herakleopolis Magna]]. A rival line (the [[Eleventh Dynasty of Egypt|Eleventh Dynasty]]) based at Thebes ruled the remaining part of Upper Egypt. The Theban rulers were apparently descendants of the [[iry-pat|prince]] of Thebes, [[Intef the Elder]]. His probable grandson [[Intef I]] was the first of the family to claim in life a partial [[Ancient Egyptian royal titulary|pharaonic titulary]], though his power did not extend much further than the general Theban region.

===Middle Kingdom===
[[File:Intef I.jpg|thumbnail|thumbnail|140px|left|[[Serekh]] of Intef I inscribed posthumously for him by Mentuhotep II]]
Finally by c. 2050 BC, [[Intef III]]'s son [[Mentuhotep II]] (meaning "Montu is satisfied"), took the Herakleopolitans by force and reunited Egypt once again under one ruler, thereby starting the period now known as the ''[[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]]''. Mentuhotep II ruled for 51 years and built the first mortuary temple at [[Deir el-Bahri]], which most likely served as the inspiration for the later and larger temple built next to it by Hatshepsut in the 18th Dynasty. After these events, the 11th Dynasty was short-lived, as less than 20 years had elapsed between the death of Mentuhotep II and that of [[Mentuhotep IV]], in mysterious circumstances.

During the [[12th Dynasty]], [[Amenemhat I]] moved the seat of power North to [[Itjtawy]]. Thebes continued to thrive as a religious center as the local god [[Amun]] was increasingly becoming prominent throughout Egypt. The oldest remains of a temple dedicated to Amun date to the reign of [[Senusret I]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Thebes was already, in the Middle Kingdom a town of considerable size. Excavations around the Karnak temple show that the Middle Kingdom town had the layout with a grid pattern. The city was at least one kilometer long and 50 hectares in area. Remains of two palatial buildings were also detected.&lt;ref&gt;[[Barry J. Kemp]]: ''Ancient Egypt, Anatomy of a Civilization'', Second Edition, New York 2006, {{ISBN|9780415235501}}, pp. 225-229&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the later part of the 12th Dynasty, a group of [[Canaan]]ite people began settling in the eastern Nile Delta. They eventually founded the [[Fourteenth Dynasty of Egypt|14th Dynasty]] at [[Avaris]] in c. 1805 BC or c. 1710 BC. By doing so, the Asiatics established hegemony over the majority of the Delta region, subtracting these territories from the influence of the [[13th Dynasty]] that had meanwhile succeeded the 12th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Wilkinson |first= Toby |authorlink= Toby Wilkinson |date=2011 |title= The Rise and Fall of Ancient Egypt |url=https://books.google.it/books?hl=it&amp;id=P07rgiJjsk4C&amp;q=nehesy#v=snippet&amp;q=nehesy&amp;f=false |location=New York |publisher= Random House |page=560 |isbn=9780747599494 }}, pp. 183-187&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second Intermediate Period===
[[File:Beni Hassan (Lepsius, BH 3) 03.jpg|thumbnail|right|Depiction of Asiatic (left) and Egyptian people (right). The Asiatic leader is labeled as "Ruler of foreign lands", Ibsha.]]
A second wave of [[Asian people|Asiatics]] called [[Hyksos]] (from ''Heqa-khasut'', "rulers of foreign lands" as Egyptians called their leaders) immigrated into Egypt and overran the Canaanite center of power at Avaris, starting the [[Fifteenth Dynasty of Egypt|15th Dynasty]] there. The Hyksos kings gained the upper hand over Lower Egypt early into the [[Second Intermediate Period]] (1657-1549 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson (2011), pp. 188 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; When the Hyksos took Memphis during or shortly after [[Merneferre Ay]]'s reign (c. 1700 BC), the rulers of the 13th Dynasty fled south to Thebes, which was restored as capital.&lt;ref name="bentor"&gt;Daphna Ben Tor: ''Sequences and chronology of Second Intermediate Period royal-name scarabs, based on excavated series from Egypt and the Levant'', in: ''The Second Intermediate Period (Thirteenth-Seventeenth Dynasties), Current Research, Future Prospects'' edited by Marcel Maree, Orientalia Lovaniensia Analecta, 192, 2010, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

Theban princes (now known as the [[Sixteenth Dynasty of Egypt|16th Dynasty]]) firmly stood over their immediate region as the Hyksos advanced from the [[Nile Delta|Delta]] southwards to Middle Egypt. The Thebans resisted the Hyksos' further advance by forming an agreement for a peaceful concurrent rule between them. The Hyksos were able to sail upstream past Thebes and some [[Cataracts of the Nile|Nile cataracts]] to trade with the [[Nubians]] and the Thebans brought their herds to the Delta without adversaries. The status quo continued until Hyksos ruler [[Apepi (pharaoh)|Apophis]] ([[Fifteenth Dynasty of Egypt|15th Dynasty]]) insulted [[Seqenenre Tao]] ([[Seventeenth Dynasty of Egypt|17th Dynasty]]) of Thebes. Soon the armies of Thebes marched on the Hyksos-ruled lands. Tao died in battle and his son [[Kamose]] took charge of the campaign. After Kamose's death, his brother [[Ahmose I]] continued till he captured [[Avaris]], the Hyksos capital. Ahmose I drove the Hyksos out of Egypt and the Levant and reclaimed the lands formerly ruled by them.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Bunson, "[http://www.e-reading.club/bookreader.php/142072/Bunson_-_Encyclopedia_of_ancient_Egypt.pdf Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt]"&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Kingdom and height of Thebes===
[[File:Statues of Memnon at Thebes during the flood-David Roberts.jpg|thumbnail|right|''[[Colossi of Memnon|Statues of Memnon]] at Thebes during the flood'' by David Roberts]]
[[Ahmose I]] founded a new age for a unified Egypt with Thebes as its capital. The city remained as capital during most of the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th Dynasty]] ([[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]]). It also became the center for a newly established professional [[civil service]], where there was a greater demand for scribes and the literate as the royal archives began to fill with accounts and reports.&lt;ref&gt;Tyldesley, Joyce. ''Egypt's Golden Empire: The Age of the New Kingdom'', pp. 18–19. Headline Book Publishing Ltd., 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; At the city the favored few of

[[File:Temple of amun karnak.jpg|thumbnail|right|Overhead illustration of the [[Karnak]] temple]]
With Egypt stabilized again, religion and religious centers flourished and none more so than Thebes. For instance, [[Amenhotep III]], poured much of his vast wealth from foreign tribute into the temples of [[Amun]].&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Dorman, P. (2015). "Thebes|Ancient city, Egypt". Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved 2016-02-07, from http://www.britannica.com/place/Thebes-ancient-Egypt&lt;/ref&gt; The Theban god Amun became a principal state deity and every building project sought to outdo the last in proclaiming the glory of Amun and the pharaohs themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Mark, J. (2009). "Thebes". Ancient History Encyclopedia. Retrieved 2016-02-06, from http://www.ancient.eu/Thebes_(Egypt)/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thutmose I]] (reigned 1506-1493 BC) began the first great expansion of the [[Karnak]] temple. After this, colossal enlargements of the temple became the norm throughout the New Kingdom.

Queen [[Hatshepsut]] (reigned 1479-1458 BC) made the Theban economy flourish by renewing trade networks, primarily the Red Sea trade between Thebes' Red Sea port of [[Al-Qusayr, Egypt|Al-Qusayr]], [[Eilat|Elat]] and the land of [[Land of Punt|Punt]]. Her successor [[Thutmose III]] brought to Thebes a great deal of his war booty that originated from as far as [[Mittani]]. The 18th Dynasty reached its peak during his great-grandson [[Amenhotep III]]'s reign (1388–1350 BC). Aside from embellishing the temples of Amun, Amenhotep increased construction in Thebes to unprecedented levels. On the west bank, he built the enormous [[Mortuary Temple of Amenhotep III|mortuary temple]] and the equally massive [[Malkata]] palace-city which fronted a 364-hectare artificial lake. In the city proper he built the [[Luxor Temple|Luxor]] temple and the Avenue of the Sphinxes leading to Karnak.

For a brief period in the reign of Amenhotep III's son [[Akhenaten]] (1351–1334 BC), Thebes fell on evil times; the city was abandoned by the court, and the worship of Amun was proscribed. The capital was moved to the new city of [[Amarna]] (Akhetaten), midway between Thebes and Memphis. After his death, his son [[Tutankhamun]] made a return to Memphis,&lt;ref&gt;J. van Dijk: ''''The Amarna Period and the later New Kingdom'', in: I. Shaw: ''The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt'', Oxford 2000, {{ISBN|0-19-815034-2}}, p. 290&lt;/ref&gt; but renewed interest in building projects at Thebes which produced even more glorious temples and shrines.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;
[[File:John Frederick Lewis - The Ramesseum at Thebes - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail|right|''The Ramesseum at Thebes'' by John Frederick Lewis]]
With the [[19th Dynasty]] the seat of government moved to the [[Nile Delta|Delta]]. Thebes maintained its revenues and prestige through the reigns of [[Seti I]] (1290–1279 BC) and [[Ramesses II]] (1279–1213 BC), who still resided for part of every year in Thebes.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Ramesses II carried out extensive building projects in the city such as statues and obelisks, the third enclosure wall of [[Karnak]] temple, additions to the [[Luxor Temple|Luxor]] temple, and the [[Ramesseum]], his grand [[mortuary temple]]. The constructions were bankrolled by the large [[Granary|granaries]] (built around the Ramesseum) which concentrated the taxes collected from Upper Egypt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, T. (2013).

Under Ramesses' long 66-year reign, Egypt and Thebes reached an overwhelming state of prosperity which equaled or even surpassed the earlier peak under Amenhotep III.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/treaty.htm Egypt: Ramses the Great, The Pharaoh Who Made Peace with his Enemies And the First Peace Treaty in History]. http://www.touregypt.net/.

The city continued to be well kept in the early [[20th Dynasty]]. The [[Papyrus Harris I|Great Harris Papyrus]] states that [[Ramesses III]] (reigned 1187–56) donated 86,486 slaves and vast estates to the temples of Amun. Ramesses III received tributes from all subject peoples including the [[Sea Peoples]] and [[Meshwesh]] Libyans. However, the whole of Egypt was experiencing financial problems, exemplified in the events at Thebes' village of [[Deir el-Medina]]. In the 25th year of his reign, workers in Deir el-Medina began striking for pay and there arose a general unrest of all social classes. Consequently, an unsuccessful harem revolt led to the deaths of many, including Theban officials and women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greatdreams.com/thebes/ramiii.htm RAMESSES III: THE LAST GREAT PHARAOH]. http://www.greatdreams.com/. Retrieved on 2016-02-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the later Ramessids, Thebes began to decline; the government fell into grave economic difficulties. During the reign of [[Ramesses IX]] (1129–1111 BC), about 1114 BC, a series of investigations into the plundering of royal tombs in the necropolis of western Thebes uncovered proof of corruption in high places, following an accusation made by the mayor of the east bank against his colleague on the west. The plundered royal mummies were moved from place to place and at last deposited by the priests of Amun in a tomb-shaft in [[Deir el-Bahri]] and in the tomb of [[Amenhotep II]]. (The finding of these two hiding places in 1881 and 1898, respectively, was one of the great events of modern archaeological discovery.) Such maladministration in Thebes led to unrest.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

===Third Intermediate Period===
Control of local affairs tended to come more and more into the hands of the [[Theban High Priests of Amun|High Priests of Amun]], so that during the [[Third Intermediate Period]], the High Priest of Amun exerted absolute power over the South, a counterbalance to the [[21st Dynasty|21st]] and [[22nd Dynasty]] kings who ruled from the Delta. Intermarriage and adoption strengthened the ties between them, daughters of the Tanite kings being installed as God’s Wife of Amun at Thebes, where they wielded greater power. Theban political influence receded only in the Late Period.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
[[File:Karnak Taharkasäule 01.JPG|thumb|150px|right|A column of [[Taharqa]] at the precinct of Amun-Re at Karnak Temple restored to full height]]
By around 750 BC, the [[Kushites]] (Nubians) were growing their influence over Thebes and Upper Egypt. [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]], the former colony of Egypt became an empire in itself. In 721 BC, King [[Shabaka]] of the Kushites defeated the combined forces of [[Osorkon IV]] ([[22nd Dynasty]]), [[Peftjauawybast]] ([[23rd Dynasty]]) [[Bakenranef]] ([[Twenty-fourth Dynasty of Egypt|24th Dynasty]]) and reunified Egypt yet again. His reign saw a significant amount of building work undertaken throughout Egypt, especially at the city of Thebes, which he made the capital of his kingdom. In [[Karnak]] he erected a pink granite statue of himself wearing the [[Pschent]] (the double crown of Egypt). [[Taharqa]] accomplished many notable projects at Thebes (i.e. the Kiosk in Karnak) and Nubia before the Assyrians started to wage war against Egypt.

===Late Period===
In 667 BC, attacked by the [[Assyria]]n king [[Ashurbanipal]]'s army, Taharqa abandoned Lower Egypt and fled to Thebes. After his death three years later his nephew (or cousin) [[Tantamani]] seized Thebes, invaded Lower Egypt and laid siege to Memphis, but abandoned his attempts to conquer the country in 663 BC and retreated southwards.{{citation needed|reason=citation needed for these dates and statements|date=July 2016}} The Assyrians pursued him and [[Sack of Thebes|took Thebes]], whose name was added to a long list of cities plundered and destroyed by the Assyrians, as Ashurbanipal wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"This city, the whole of it, I conquered it with the help of Ashur and Ishtar. Silver, gold, precious stones, all the wealth of the palace, rich cloth, precious linen, great horses, supervising men and women, two obelisks of splendid electrum, weighing 2,500 talents, the doors of temples I tore from their bases and carried them off to Assyria. With this weighty booty I left Thebes. Against Egypt and Kush I have lifted my spear and shown my power. With full hands I have returned to Nineveh, in good health."{{citation needed|reason=where is this quote from?  It needs a citation.|date=July 2016}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thebes never regained its former political significance, but it remained an important religious centre. Assyrians installed [[Psamtik I]] (664-610 BC), who ascended to Thebes in 656 BC and brought about the adoption of his own daughter, [[Nitocris I]], as heiress to God's Wife of Amun there. In 525 BC, Persian [[Cambyses II]] invaded Egypt and became pharaoh, subordinating the kingdom as a [[satrapy]] to the greater [[Achaemenid Empire]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

===Graeco-Roman Period===
[[File:Temple of Deir el-Medina 18.JPG|thumb|150px|right|Relief in [[Hathor]] temple, Deir el-Medina (built during the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic Dynasty]])]]
The good relationship of the Thebans with the central power in the North ended when the native Egyptian pharaohs were finally replaced by Greeks, led by [[Alexander the Great]]. He visited Thebes during a celebration of the [[Opet Festival]]. In spite of his welcoming visit, Thebes became a center for dissent. Towards the end of the third century BC, [[Hugronaphor]] (Horwennefer), possibly of Nubian origin, led a revolt against the Ptolemies in Upper Egypt. His successor, [[Ankhmakis]], held large parts of Upper Egypt until 185 BC. This revolt was supported by the Theban priesthood. After the suppression of the revolt in 185 BC, [[Ptolemy V]], in need of the support of the priesthood, forgave them.

Half a century later the Thebans rose again, elevating a certain [[Harsiesi]] to the throne in 132 BC. Harsiesi, having helped himself to the funds of the royal bank at Thebes, fled the following year. In 91 BC, another revolt broke out. In the following years, Thebes was subdued, and the city turned into rubble.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/the_destruction_of_thebes.htm The fall of Thebes to the Assyrians and its decline thereafter]. http://www.reshafim.org.il/.

During the Roman occupation (30 BC-349 AD), the remaining communities clustered around the pylon of the Luxor temple. Thebes became part of the Roman province of ''[[Thebais]]'', which later split into ''Thebais Superior'', centered at the city, and ''Thebais Inferior'', centered at [[Ptolemais Hermiou]]. A [[Roman legion]] was headquartered in Luxor temple at the time of Roman campaigns in Nubia.&lt;ref&gt;Dorman, P. (2015). "Luxor". Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved 2016-02-27, from http://www.britannica.com/place/Luxor&lt;/ref&gt; Building did not come to an abrupt stop, but the city continued to decline. In the first century AD, [[Strabo]] described Thebes as having been relegated to a mere village.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Still the second largest religious building ever built, it is the main house of worship for [[Amun]], Thebes' patron deity, and the residence of the powerful [[High Priest of Amun|Amun priesthood]]. What differentiated it from the many temples of Egypt is the length of time it was built over (more than 2,000 years, starting in the Middle Kingdom). The main features of this temple are its ten large [[Pylon (architecture)|pylon]]s, the [[Great Hypostyle Hall]], a sacred lake, sub-temples, numerous shrines and multiple [[obelisk]]s. It was the most important temple for a majority of Ancient Egyptian [[History of Ancient Egypt|history]].
* '''[[Luxor Temple]]''' (''Ipet resyt''). Unlike the other temples in Thebes, it is not dedicated to a cult god or a deified version of the king in death. Instead, it is dedicated to the rejuvenation of kingship; it may have been where many of the [[pharaoh]]s of Egypt were crowned. It is a centerpiece of the "Opet Festival", where the sacred [[barque]] of the [[Theban Triad]] travels from Karnak to Luxor temple highlighting the godly significance of the pharaoh's re-coronation .

'''Walter Biggar Blaikie''' [[FRSE]] [[Deputy Lieutenant|DL]] [[Legum Doctor|LLD]] (23 November 1847 in [[Pilrig]], Edinburgh – 3 May 1928) was a Scottish civil engineer, printer, historian and astronomer.&lt;ref name=RSEHistList/&gt;

==Life==
Second of the seven recorded sons of [[William Garden Blaikie]], minister of [[Pilrig]] Free Church, and Margaret Catherine Biggar, Walter Biggar Blaikie was educated at [[Edinburgh Academy]] and [[Edinburgh University]].

He worked as a civil engineer with the Department for Public Works in India from 1870 until 1873, but after the birth of their first child he and his wife returned to Scotland to work for the large engineering firm of [[Benjamin Blyth II|Blyth &amp; Blyth]] where he worked until 1880. In 1879, he became involved in the printing business which became [[Archibald Constable|T and A Constable]] of [[Edinburgh]].&lt;ref name=KitWBB&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kittybrewster.com/ancestry/blaikie.htm|title=The Genealogy of the Blaikie Family |author=W. R. Arbuthnot |display-authors=etal|publisher=Kittybrewster generalogy website of W.R.Arbuthnot|date=1 October 2008|accessdate=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would work with the firm for almost fifty years, and for many years he ran it.&lt;ref name=AmyYouWBB&gt;{{cite book |title=Blaikie of Aberdeen|author=A.H.Young|publisher=A.H Young (printed by Kendall and Strachan, Pietermaritzburg)|date=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He became one of the leading scholars of the [[Jacobite risings|Jacobite]] period, especially of the life of [[Bonnie Prince Charlie]].

In 1897 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]], his proposers being [[John George Bartholomew]], [[John Murray (oceanographer)|Sir John Murray]], Frederick Bailey and [[Hugh Robert Mill]]. He served as Vice President of the Society 1924 to 1927.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

He is buried in the grave of his maternal grandfather, Henry Balfour Biggar, in the north-east corner of the north extension to [[St Cuthbert's Church, Edinburgh|St Cuthberts Churchyard]] in Edinburgh. He is the last named on a badly eroded stone.

==Walter Blaikie Collection==

In 1928 his daughters donated a large collection of his historical papers concerning the Jacobite Uprising and the Stuarts to the [[National Library of Scotland]]. This ran to 1076 printed items in 756 volumes, 42 manuscripts, 3 charters and around 400 engravings.&lt;ref name="nls"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nls.uk/catalogues/online/snpc/list.cfm?letter=W|website=nls.uk|title=Special and Named Printed Collections in the National Library of Scotland|accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1938">'''''Words of Peace and Truth''''' ({{lang-he|'''Divrei Shalom ve-Emet'''}}) was a Hebrew work produced by the [[Jew]]ish [[scholar]] [[Naphtali Herz Wessely]], a disciple of [[Moses Mendelssohn]] and a prominent figure of the [[Haskalah]].  

Published in 1782, the tract aimed to encourage [[Central Europe]]an Jewry to accept the [[Edict of Toleration]] issued by [[Emperor Joseph II]] of [[Austria]], which sought to promote a greater degree of acculturation and [[secularization]] among the Jewish community.   The text was geared particularly toward [[Rabbi]]nic leadership.  

Wessely wished to convince the Rabbinic authorities that the spread of secular [[education]] would be to the benefit of the Jewish community, and was not something that they should fear.   He essentially differentiated between two different kinds of [[knowledge]]: ''Torat Ha-Elohim'' ([[divinity|divine]], or religious knowledge) and ''Torat Ha-Adam'' ([[human]], or secular knowledge).  While both components are necessary, Wessely argued that the acquisition of secular education must precede the acquisition of divine knowledge; ultimately, secular learning is a universal body of knowledge which is to be supplemented by the religious instruction of the [[Torah]].

In many ways, Wessely’s reprioritization of education was contrary to traditional Jewish practice.  The study of secular subjects first and the Torah second seemed repugnant to many rabbis, who denounced the work in harsh terms.  In [[Vilna]], the book was burned publicly; however in [[Italy]] and other places, it was applauded as an enlightened and legitimate work.

A '''World Series ring''' is an award given to [[Major League Baseball]] players who win the [[World Series]]. Since only one [[Commissioner's Trophy (MLB)|Commissioner's Trophy]] is awarded to the team, a World Series [[championship ring|ring]] is an individual award that players and staff of each World Series champion team get to keep for themselves to symbolize the victory. World Series rings are uniquely commissioned by the winning team each year and presented to deserving players and staff early in the next season.&lt;ref name="2006ring"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/16/AR2007111601727.html |title=World Series ring |date=November 17, 2007 |publisher=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rings have been made by companies that include [[Jostens]], [[Tiffany &amp; Co.]], [[Dieges &amp; Clust]],  and [[L.G. Balfour Company]].


The first World Series ring was given to members of the [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] after winning the [[1922 World Series]].&lt;ref name="1922ring"/&gt; By the 1930s, each winning team gave their players a ring. Though the ring started off simple, usually containing only one [[diamond]], rings over time have become more elaborate and ornate, with the [[2003 World Series]] ring containing over 200 diamonds.

In addition to their inherent value, World Series rings also carry additional value as [[sports memorabilia]]. A World Series ring belonging to [[Casey Stengel]] sold for $180,000. [[Lenny Dykstra]]'s [[1986 World Series]] ring sold for over $56,000 during his [[bankruptcy]] proceedings. Other rings sold in auctions have sold for over $10,000 apiece. Replica rings given to fans have sold for as much as $300.

[[Frankie Crosetti]] and [[Tommy Henrich]] requested [[shotgun]]s from the Yankees following World Series championships.&lt;ref name=nydn/&gt; [[Grover Cleveland Alexander]] reportedly [[pawnshop|pawn]]ed his [[1926 World Series]] ring.&lt;ref name=sportsillustrated/&gt;

Members of the [[1973 World Series]] champion [[Oakland Athletics]] were upset when team owner [[Charlie O. Finley]], following salary disputes with his players, presented his team with rings that were identical to the ones received after winning the [[1972 World Series]], except without the one-[[carat (mass)|carat]] [[diamond]].

Teams have also increasingly added distinctive touches to make their rings unique from previous versions.

|quote=I've seen it called "tacky" and it is, but here's the thing about these rings: They're not supposed to be understated. They're always over the top. When they're worn, they're done so obnoxiously. There's nothing humble or particularly beautiful about them. In fact, they're always kind of ugly, no matter the team. They're full of jewels and they're shiny, but it's always too much.

'''Zionist political violence''' or  refers to acts of violence or terror{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} committed by [[Zionism|Zionists]].

Actions have been carried out by individuals and Jewish paramilitary groups such as the [[Irgun]], the [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]], the [[Haganah]] and the [[Palmach]] as part of a conflict between Jews, [[Mandatory Palestine|British]] authorities, and [[Palestinian people|Palestinian Arabs]], regarding land, immigration, and control over Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jcpa.org/jl/vp490.htm |title=The Beleaguered Christians of the Palestinian-Controlled Areas, by David Raab |publisher=Jcpa.org |accessdate=2010-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British soldiers and officials, [[United Nations]] personnel, Palestinian Arab fighters and civilians, and Jewish fighters and civilians have been targets or victims of these actions. Domestic, commercial, and government property, infrastructure, and material have also been attacked.

==Main occurrences==

During [[World War I]], Zionist volunteers fought in the [[Jewish Legion]] of the [[British Army]] against the [[Ottoman Turks]]

During the [[1920 Nebi Musa riots]], the 1921 [[Jaffa riots]] and the [[1929 Palestine riots]], Palestinian Arabs manifested hostility against zionist immigration, which provoked the reaction of Jewish militias.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ameu.org/getattachment/65e15600-d2b0-472e-923e-be4ed7ed1514/Zionist-Violence-Against-Palestinians.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935, the [[Irgun]], a Zionist underground military organization, split off from the [[Haganah]].&lt;ref name=Welty&gt;{{Cite book|title=Palestinian Nationalism and the Struggle for National Self-Determination |last=Welty |first=Gordon |authorlink=Gordon Welty |year=1995 |publisher=Temple University |location=Philadelphia |isbn=1-56639-342-6 |page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Irgun were the armed expression of the nascent ideology of [[Revisionist Zionism]] founded by [[Ze'ev Jabotinsky]]. He expressed this [[ideology]] as ''"every Jew had the right to enter Palestine; only active retaliation would deter the Arab and the British; only Jewish armed force would ensure the Jewish state"''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Howard Sachar]]: '[['A History of the State of Israel]]'', pps 265–266&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine]], Palestinian Arabs fought for the end of the Mandate and the creation of an Arab state based on the whole of Palestine. They attacked both British and Jews as well as some Palestinian Arabs who supported a [[Pan-Arabism]]. Mainstream Zionists, represented by the [[Vaad Leumi]] and the Haganah, practiced the policy of [[Havlagah]] (restraint), while Irgun militants did not follow this policy and called themselves "Havlagah breakers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tucker |first1=Spencer C. |last2=Roberts |first2=Priscilla |title=The Encyclopedia of the Arab-Israeli Conflict |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2008 |page=433 |isbn=9781851098415}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Irgun began bombing Palestinian Arab civilian targets in 1938.&lt;ref name=Welty/&gt; While the Palestinian Arabs were "carefully disarmed" by the British Mandatory authorities by 1939, the Zionists were not.&lt;ref name=Welty/&gt;

After the beginning of [[World War II]], the Haganah and Irgun suspended their activity against the British in support of their war against [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/stern.html |title=Avraham Stern |accessdate=2007-11-19 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The smaller [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] continued anti-British attacks and [[direct action (military)|direct action]] throughout the war. At that time, the British also supported the creation and the training of [[Palmach]], as a unit that could withstand a German offensive in the area, with the consent of [[Yishuv]] which saw an opportunity to get trained units and soldiers for the planned Jewish state&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gal|first=Reuven |title=A Portrait of the Israeli Soldier |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=1986 |page=6 |isbn=0313243158}}&lt;/ref&gt; and during 1944–1945, the most mainstream Jewish paramilitary organization, Haganah, cooperated with the British authorities against the Lehi and Etzel.&lt;ref name="galor"&gt;Gal-or, Noemi. Tolerating Terrorism in the West: An International Survey. Routledge, 2004. p.74&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II, between 1945 and the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|29 November 1947 Partition vote]], British soldiers and [[Palestine Police Force|policemen]] were [[Jewish insurgency in Palestine|targeted by Irgun and Lehi]]. Haganah and [[Palmah]] first collaborated with the British against them, particularly during [[the Hunting Season]], before actively joining them in the [[Jewish Resistance Movement]], then finally choosing an official neutral position after 1946 while the Irgun and the Lehi went on their attacks against the British.&lt;ref&gt;Horne, Edward (1982).

But remained permanently uncooperative.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Haganah carried out violent attacks in Palestine, such as the liberation of interned immigrants from the [[Atlit]] camp, the bombing of the country's railroad network, sabotage raids on radar installations and bases of the British Palestine police. It also continued to organize illegal immigration.&lt;ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Immigration/atlit.html |title=Atlit Immigration Camp &amp;#124; Jewish Virtual Library |publisher=jewishvirtuallibrary.org|accessdate=2015-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1947, the British announced that they would end the mandate and withdraw from Palestine and they asked the arbitration of the [[United Nations]]. After the vote of the Partition Plan for Palestine on 30 November 1947, [[1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine|civil war broke out in Palestine]]. Jewish and Arab communities fought each other violently in campaigns of attacks, retaliations and counter-retaliations which provoked around 800 deaths after two months. Arab volunteers entered Palestine to fight alongside the Palestinian Arabs. In April, 6 weeks before the termination of the Mandate, the Jewish militias launched wide operations to control the territory dedicated to them by the Partition Plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Morris |first=Benny |title=Histoire revisitée du conflit arabo-sioniste |publisher=Editions complexe |year=2003 |pages=16–17 |isbn=978-2-87027-938-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Killings and massacres during the 1948 Palestine War|Many atrocities occurred]] during this time. The Arab population in the mixed cities of [[Tiberias]], [[Safed]], [[Haifa]], [[Jaffa]], [[Beisan]] and [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] and in the neighbouring villages fled or were expelled during this period. During the [[Battle for Jerusalem (1948)]] where the Jewish community of 100,000 people was besieged, most Arab villages of the [[Tel Aviv]] – Jerusalem corridor were captured by Jewish militias and leveled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lapierre |first1=Dominique |last2=Collins |first2=Larry |title=O Jérusalem |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |year=1971 |pages=131–153 |isbn=978-2-266-10698-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the civil war, the Jewish militias organized several bombing attacks against civilians and military Arab targets. On 12 December, Irgun placed a car bomb opposite the Damascus Gate, killing 20 people.&lt;ref name="Karsh 2002, p.32"&gt;Karsh (2002), p.32&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 January 1948, the Lehi detonated a lorry bomb against the headquarters of the paramilitary [[Najjada]] located in [[Jaffa]]'s Town Hall, killing 15 Arabs and injuring 80.&lt;ref name="Karsh 2002, p.32"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Yoav Gelber]], 'Palestine 1948', p.20; The Scotsman newspaper, 6th January 1948; Walid Khalidi states that 25 civilians were killed, in addition to the military targets.

==Condemnation as terrorism==

Khalidi, 1971, 'From Haven to Conquest', p. 598&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946, The World Zionist Congress strongly condemned terrorist activities in Palestine and "the shedding of innocent blood as a means of political warfare". Irgun was specifically condemned.&lt;ref name = NYTirgun&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1946/12/24/archives/zionists-condemn-palestine-terror-basle-congress-bars-joining-in.html?sq=Irgun+terrorist+president&amp;scp=13&amp;st=p Zionists Condemn Palestine Terror] New York Times. December 24, 1946.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Menachem Begin]] was called a [[Terrorism|terrorist]] and a [[Fascism|fascist]] by [[Albert Einstein]] and 27 other prominent Jewish intellectuals in a letter to the New York Times which was published on December 4, 1948. Specifically condemned was the participation of the Irgun in the Deir Yassin massacre:&lt;ref name="New Palestine Party"&gt;{{cite letter |author1=Isidore Abramowitz|author2=[[Hannah Arendt]]|author3=Abraham Brick|author4=[[Jessurun Cardozo]]|author5=[[Albert Einstein]]|author6=Herman Eisen|author7=Hayim Fineman|author8=M.

*"terrorist bands attacked this peaceful village, which was not a military objective in the fighting, killed most of its inhabitants – 240 men, women and children – and kept a few of them alive to parade as captives through the streets of Jerusalem."

The letter warns [[American Jews]] against supporting Begin's request for funding of his political party [[Herut]], and ends with the warning:
*"The discrepancies between the bold claims now being made by Begin and his party and their record of past performance in Palestine bear the imprint of no ordinary political party. This is the unmistakable stamp of a Fascist party for whom terrorism (against Jews, Arabs, and British alike), and misrepresentation are means, and a "Leader State" is the goal."&lt;ref name="New Palestine Party"/&gt;

Lehi was described as a [[terrorist]] organization&lt;ref&gt;"Stern Gang"  ''A Dictionary of World History''. Oxford University Press, 2000. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O48-SternGang.html].&lt;/ref&gt; by the British authorities and United Nations mediator [[Ralph Bunche]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/9a798adbf322aff38525617b006d88d7/45fc0c6e511ec0c5802564d400560ca0!OpenDocument&amp;Highlight=0,terrorists,bernadotte Ralph Bunche report on assassination of UN mediator] 27th Sept 1948, "notorious terrorists long known as the Stern group"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewish public opinion==
During the conflict between Arabs and Jews in Palestine before the war, the criterion of "[[Purity of arms]]" was used to distinguish between the respective attitudes of the Irgun and Haganah towards Arabs, with the latter priding itself on its adherence to principle.&lt;ref name="shapira1"/&gt; The Jewish society in the British Mandate Palestine generally disapproved and denounced violent attacks both on grounds moral rejection and political disagreement, stressing that terrorism is counter-productive in the Zionist quest for Jewish self-determination.&lt;ref name="galor"/&gt; Generally speaking, this precept requires that "weapons remain pure [and that] they are employed only in self-defence and [never] against innocent civilians and defenceless people".&lt;ref name="shlaimdebate"&gt;[[Avi Shlaim]], ''[http://www.press.umich.edu/pdf/9780472115419-ch5.pdf The Debate About 1948]'', International Journal of Middle East Studies, 27:3, 1995, pp. 287–304&lt;/ref&gt; But if it "remained a central value in education" it was "rather vague and intentionally blurred" at the practical level.&lt;ref name="shapira1"&gt;[[Anita Shapira]] (1992), p. 252&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, at a meeting held between the heads of the Haganah, [[David Ben-Gurion]] predicted a confrontation between the Arabs of Palestine and the Arab states. Concerning the "principle of purity of arms", he stressed that: "The end does not justify all means. Our war is based on moral grounds"&lt;ref name="shapira2"&gt;[[Anita Shapira]] (1992), p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; and during the 1948 War, the [[Mapam]], the political party affiliated to Palmach, asked "a strict observance of the Jewish [[Purity of arms]] to secure the moral character of [the] war".&lt;ref name="gelber1948"&gt;[[Yoav Gelber]] (2006), p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; When he was later criticized by Mapam members for his attitude concerning the [[1948 Palestinian exodus|Arab refugee problem]], Ben-Gurion reminded them of the [[1948 Palestinian exodus from Lydda and Ramle|Palestinian exodus from Lydda and Ramle]] and the fact Palmah officers had been responsible for the "outrage that had encouraged the Arabs' flight made the party uncomfortable."&lt;ref name="gelber1948"/&gt;

According to [[Avi Shlaim]], this condemnation of the use of violence is one of the key features of 'the conventional Zionist account or old history' whose 'popular-heroic-moralistic version' is 'taught in Israeli schools and used extensively in the quest for legitimacy abroad'.&lt;ref name="shlaimdebate"/&gt; [[Benny Morris]] adds that '[t]he Israelis' collective memory of fighters characterized by "purity of arms" is also undermined by the evidence of [the dozen case] of rapes committed in conquered towns and villages.' According to him, 'after the 1948 war, the Israelis tended to hail the "purity of arms" of its militiamen and soldiers to contrast this with Arab barbarism, which on occasion expressed itself in the mutilation of captured Jewish corpses.' According to him, 'this reinforced the Israelis' positive self-image and helped them "sell" the new state abroad and (...) demonized the enemy'.&lt;ref name=Morris2008p404&gt;Morris 2008, pp. 404-406.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Israelis justify acts of political violence. Sixty years after participating in the assassination of Count Bernadotte, Geula Cohen had no regrets. As a broadcaster on Lehi's radio, she recalled the threats against Bernadotte in advance of the assassination. "I told him if you are not going to leave Jerusalem and go to your Stockholm, you won't be any more." Asked if it was right to assassinate Bernadotte, she replied, "There is no question about it. We would not have Jerusalem any more."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/israels-forgotten-hero-the-assassination-of-count-bernadotte--and-the-death-of-peace-934094.html Israel's forgotten hero: The assassination of Count Bernadotte - and the death of peace] The Independent, 18 Jan 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2006, the [[Menachem Begin Heritage Center]] organized a conference to mark the 60th anniversary of the [[King David Hotel bombing]]. The conference was attended by past and future Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] and former members of Irgun.&lt;ref name="spirit"&gt;Tom Segev, [http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/opinion/the-spirit-of-the-king-david-hotel-1.193571 "The spirit of the King David Hotel"], ''[[Haaretz]]'', July 23, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The British Ambassador in Tel Aviv and the Consul-General in Jerusalem protested that a plaque commemorating the bombing stated "For reasons known only to the British, the hotel was not evacuated."&lt;ref name="spirit"/&gt; Netanyahu, then chairman of [[Likud]] and [[Leader of the Opposition (Israel)|Leader of the Opposition]] in the [[Knesset]], opined that the bombing was a legitimate act with a military target, distinguishing it from an act of terror intended to harm civilians, since Irgun sent warnings to evacuate the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Nicholas|last=Bethell|title=The Palestine Triangle|publisher=Andre Deutsch|year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said "Imagine that Hamas or Hizbullah would call the military headquarters in Tel Aviv and say, 'We have placed a bomb and we are asking you to evacuate the area.' They don't do that. That is the difference."&lt;ref name=truth&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/Features/Article.aspx?id=29576|title=Reflective truth|publisher=''Jerusalem Post''|date=July 27, 2006|first=Eetta|last=Prince-Gibson|accessdate=2009-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British Ambassador in Tel Aviv and the Consul-General in Jerusalem protested, saying "We do not think that it is right for an act of terrorism, which led to the loss of many lives, to be commemorated", and wrote to the Mayor of [[Jerusalem]] that such an "act of terror" could not be honored. The British government also demanded the removal of the plaque, pointing out that the statement on it accusing the British of failing to evacuate the hotel was untrue and "did not absolve those who planted the bomb."&lt;ref&gt;Ned Parker and [[Stephen Farrell (journalist)|Stephen Farrell]], [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-2277717,00.html "British anger at terror celebration"], ''[[The Times]]'', July 20, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent a diplomatic incident, changes were made in the plaque's text. The final English version says "Warning phone calls have been made to the hotel, The Palestine Post and the French Consulate, urging the hotel's occupants to leave immediately. The hotel was not evacuated and after 25 minutes the bombs exploded. To the Irgun's regret, 92 persons were killed."&lt;ref name=truth/&gt;
