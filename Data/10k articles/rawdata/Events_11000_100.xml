The '''10th G7 Summit''' was held in [[London]], [[England]], [[United Kingdom]] from June 7 to June 9, 1984. The venue for the summit meetings was [[Lancaster House]] in London.&lt;ref name="j-mofa1"&gt;Japan, [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] ([[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan)|MOFA]]): [http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/economy/summit/2000/past_summit/table_e/index.html  Summit Meetings in the Past.]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The [[G8#History|Group of Seven]] ([[G8#History|G7]]) was an unofficial forum which brought together the heads of the richest industrialized countries: [[France]], [[West Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]] (since 1976)&lt;ref name="saunders1"&gt;Saunders, Doug.

[[File:Smallpox PHIL 3278.tif|thumb|Field physicians checking an immunization reaction in a man during a smallpox epidemic, Kosovo, 1972]]
The '''1972 Yugoslav smallpox outbreak''' was the last major outbreak of [[smallpox]] in [[Europe]]. It was centred in [[Kosovo]] and [[Belgrade]] (both then part of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]). A [[Muslim]] pilgrim had contracted the [[smallpox virus]] in the [[Middle East]]. Upon returning to his home in Kosovo, he started the epidemic in which 175 people were infected, 35 of whom died. The epidemic was efficiently contained by enforced [[quarantine]] and mass [[vaccination]]. The 1982 film ''[[Variola Vera]]'' is based on the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Markovic|first=Goran|title=Variola Vera|date=1982-07-09|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083275/|others=Rade Serbedzija, Erland Josephson, Dusica Zegarac|accessdate=2017-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
By 1972, vaccination for smallpox had long been widely available and the disease was considered to be eradicated in Europe. The population of Yugoslavia had been regularly vaccinated against smallpox for 50 years, and the last case was reported in 1930. This was the major cause for the initial slow reaction by doctors, who did not promptly recognize the symptoms of the disease.

In October 1970, an Afghan family went on pilgrimage from Afghanistan, where smallpox was endemic, to [[Mashhad]] in Iran, triggering a massive epidemic of smallpox in Iran that would last until September 1972. By late 1971, smallpox-infected devotees on pilgrimage had carried the smallpox from Iran into Syria and Iraq.

== The outbreak ==
[[Image:Smallpox PHIL 2003 lores.jpg|thumb|Patient with smallpox, Kosovo, Yugoslavia epidemic, March and April 1972.]]
In early 1972, a 38-year-old [[Kosovo Albanian]] [[Muslim]] clergyman named Ibrahim Hoti, from [[Damnjane]] near [[Đakovica]], Kosovo, Serbia, undertook the [[hajj|pilgrimage to Mecca]]. He also visited holy sites in [[Iraq]], where there were known cases of smallpox. He returned home on February 15. The following morning he felt achy and tired, but attributed this to the long bus journey. Hoti soon realised that he had some kind of infection, but, after feeling feverish for a couple of days and developing a rash, he recovered - probably because he had been vaccinated two months earlier.

On March 3, Latif Mumdžić, a thirty-year-old schoolteacher, who had just arrived in Đakovica to enroll at the local higher institute of education, fell ill. He had no known direct contacts with the clergyman, so he might have been infected by one of the clergyman's friends or relatives who visited him during his illness, or by passing the clergyman in the street.

When Mumdžić visited the local medical center two days later, the doctors tried to treat his fever with [[penicillin]] (smallpox is a virus, so this was ineffective). His condition did not improve, and after a couple of days his brother took him to the hospital in [[Čačak]], 150&amp;nbsp;km to the north in Serbia. The doctors there could not help him, so he was transferred by ambulance to the central hospital in [[Belgrade]].

On March 9, Mumdžić was shown to medical students and staff as a case of an atypical reaction to penicillin, which was a plausible explanation for his condition. On the following day, Mumdžić suffered massive internal bleeding and, despite efforts to save his life, died in the evening.

The cause of death was listed as "reaction to penicillin". In fact he had contracted ''[[black pox]]'', a highly contagious form of smallpox. Before his death, Mumdžić directly infected 38 people (including nine doctors and nurses), eight of whom would consequently die.

A few days after Mumdžić's death, a wave of 140 smallpox cases erupted across Kosovo province.

== Reaction ==
The government's reaction was swift. [[Martial law]] was declared on March 16. Measures included ''[[cordon sanitaire|cordons sanitaires]]'' of villages and neighbourhoods, roadblocks, prohibition of public meetings, closure of borders and prohibition of all non-essential travel. Hotels were requisitioned for quarantines in which 10,000 people who may have been in contact with the virus were held under guard by the army. 

Mumdžić's brother developed a smallpox rash on March 20, resulting in medical authorities realising that Mumdžić had died of smallpox. The authorities undertook a massive revaccination of the population, helped by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), "...almost the entire Yugoslavian population of 18 million people was vaccinated." Leading experts on smallpox were flown in to help, including [[Donald Henderson]] and [[Don Francis]].

Within two weeks, almost the entire population had been re-vaccinated. By mid-May the spread of the disease was stopped and the country returned to normal life. During the epidemic, 175 people contracted smallpox and 35 of them died.

== Legacy ==
The Yugoslav government received international praise for the successful containment of the epidemic, which was also one of the finest hours for [[Donald Henderson]] and the WHO, as well as one of the crucial steps in the eradication of smallpox.

In 1982, Serbian director [[Goran Marković (film director)|Goran Marković]] made the film ''[[Variola Vera (film)|Variola Vera]]'' about a hospital under quarantine during the epidemic. In 2002, the [[BBC]] screened a television drama called ''[[Smallpox 2002]]'', which was partly inspired by the events.

The '''1982 Liberation Memorial''' is a [[war memorial]] in [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]], [[Falkland Islands]]. It commemorates all British Forces and supporting units that served in the [[Falklands War]] and helped liberate the [[Falkland Islanders]] from [[Occupation of the Falkland Islands|Argentine military occupation]] in 1982. The Memorial is situated in front of the Secretariat Building, overlooking [[Stanley Harbour]]. The funds for the Memorial were raised entirely by Falkland Islanders and it was unveiled by the [[Governor of the Falkland Islands]], [[Rex Hunt (governor)|Sir Rex Hunt]], on [[Liberation Day (Falkland Islands)|Liberation Day]] (14 June) 1984, the second anniversary of the end of the war.&lt;ref name="FITB"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.falklandislands.com/things-to-do/1982-liberation-memorial-p673571|title=1982 Liberation Memorial - Things to Do in the Falkland Islands|website=www.falklandislands.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The Memorial consists of an [[obelisk]] on the front of which is the [[coat of arms of the Falkland Islands]] surrounded by a [[laurel wreath]] above the words "In Memory of Those Who Liberated Us" and the date the war ended; "14 June 1982". On top of the obelisk is a bronze figure of [[Britannia]], the female personification of the island of [[Great Britain]]. On the back and sides of the Memorial are the lists of the [[List of British Army regiments|British Army regiments]], [[List of Royal Air Force aircraft squadrons|RAF squadrons]], [[List of Royal Navy ships|Royal Navy vessels]] and the [[List of Royal Marine formations and units|Royal Marine formations and units]] that took part in the conflict. The names of the 255 British military personnel who died during the war are listed on ten plaques behind the Memorial, divided into the [[service branch]]es. Directly behind the Memorial is a [[relief]] depicting famous moments during the war.

The Memorial was designed by Falklands-born architect Gerald Dixon and the bronze figure of Britannia was sculptured by David Norris.&lt;ref name="FITB"/&gt;

In 2015 a [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] of [[Margaret Thatcher]] (who was [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] at the time of the 1982 war) was erected next to the Liberation Memorial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/margaret-thatcher/11338281/Margaret-Thatcher-statue-unveiled-in-the-Falklands.html|title=Margaret Thatcher statue unveiled in the Falklands|last=Agency|date=2015|access-date=2018-02-14|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
Services are held at the Memorial each year on 14 June ([[Liberation Day (Falkland Islands)|Liberation Day]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://en.mercopress.com/2017/06/14/commemorations-for-35th-anniversary-of-liberation-day-held-in-falklands|title=Commemorations for 35th anniversary of Liberation Day held in Falklands|work=MercoPress|access-date=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on [[Remembrance Sunday]], the closest Sunday to 11 November ([[Armistice Day]]), with [[Remembrance poppy#United Kingdom|wreaths]] being laid at the foot of the Memorial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://en.mercopress.com/2017/11/10/falklands-observance-of-remembrance-day-on-sunday-12-november|title=Falklands Observance of Remembrance Day on Sunday 12 November|work=MercoPress|access-date=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''63rd World Science Fiction Convention''' ([[Worldcon]]) was called ''Interaction'', and was held in [[Glasgow]], Scotland 4–8 August 2005. The event was also the [[Eurocon]]. The Venue for the 63rd Worldcon was the [[Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre]] (SECC) with the attached [[Clyde Auditorium]] (often called "The Armadillo") and Moat House Hotel. Parties took place at the Hilton Hotel.

The total registered membership of the convention was 5202, of which 4115 physically attended. The members represented 35 different nationalities. By far the largest contingents were from the USA and the UK. The organising committee was co-chaired by Colin Harris and Vincent Docherty.

The site for the [[65th World Science Fiction Convention|2007 Worldcon]] was decided at the [[62nd World Science Fiction Convention|2004 Worldcon in Boston]] under the old three year lead-time rule.  The site selection for the [[66th World Science Fiction Convention|2008 Worldcon]], the first under the new two year lead-time rule,  took place at the [[64th World Science Fiction Convention|2006 Worldcon in Los Angeles]].

The '''Agartala Conspiracy Case''' was a [[sedition]] case in [[Pakistan]] during the Ayub Regime against Awami League, brought by the government of Pakistan in 1968 against [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]], the then leader of the [[Awami League]] and [[East Pakistan]], and 34 other persons.&lt;ref name=true /&gt;

==Case==
The case was filed in early 1968 and implicated Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and others in conspiring with [[India]] against the stability of Pakistan. The case is officially called ''State vs. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and others'', but is popularly known as ''Agartala Shoŗojontro Mamla'' (Agartala conspiracy case) as the main conspiracy was purported to have taken place in the Indian city of [[Agartala]] in Tripura state, where Sheikh Mujib's associates met Indian military officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZBs0HdpKuaQC|title=Pakistan: A Modern History|author=Ian Talbot|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0-312-21606-1|page=190|quote=The case against them became known as the Agartala Conspiracy Case since it was at Agartala that the accused were alleged to have met Indian army officers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accused==
The government of Pakistan brought charges against 35 political personalities including three eminent civil servants officials under civil law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZBs0HdpKuaQC|title=Pakistan: A Modern History|author=Ian Talbot|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0-312-21606-1|page=190|quote=The list of thirty-five conspirators included three high-ranking East Pakistan civil servants.}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]], Ahmed Fazlur Rahman CSP, Steward Mujibur Rahman, Commander [[Moazzem Hossain]], former LS Sultanuddin Ahmad, LSCDI Nur Mohammad, Flight Sergeant Mahfiz Ullah, Corporal Abdus Samad, former Havildar Dalil Uddin, Ruhul Quddus CSP, Flight Sergeant Md. Fazlul Haq, [[Bibhuti Bhushan Chowdhury]] alias Manik Chowdhury, Bidhan Krishna Sen, Subedar Abdur Razzaque, former clerk Mujibur Rahman, former Flight Sergeant Md. Abdur Razzaque, Sergeant [[Zahurul Haq]], [[Benedict Dias]], A.B. Khurshid, Khan Mohammad Shamsur Rahman CSP, [[AKM Shamsul Haque]], Havildar Azizul Haq, Mahfuzul Bari, Sergeant Shamsul Haq, Shamsul Alam, Captain Mohammad Abdul Muttalib, 21 Baluch Regiment, [[Col. Shawkat Ali|Captain Shawkat Ali]], Captain [[Khondkar Nazmul Huda]], Captain [[A. N. M. Nuruzzaman|A.N.M Nuruzzaman]], Sergeant Abdul Jalil, [[Mahbub Uddin Chowdhury]], Lt. M Rahman, former Subedar Tajul Islam, Ali Reza, Captain Khurshid Uddeen Ahmed, Master Warrant Officer Abdul Latif Majumdar, and Lt. Abdur Rauf.&lt;ref name=banglapedia /&gt;

==Plot and detection==
The plot was conceived by Sheikh Mujib in an attempt to ignite an armed revolution against [[West Pakistan]] that would result in the secession. Two of the accused, navy steward Mujibur Rahman and the educationist Mohammad Ali Reza went to Agartala, Tripura, a city in Eastern India to seek Indian support for an independent Bangladesh.&lt;ref name=truthshawkat&gt;{{cite news |date=12 June 2010|title=Textbook 'incorrectly' describes Agartala Case: Shawkat |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=142345 |newspaper=The Daily Star |agency=BSS |accessdate=2 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The alleged conspiracy was uncovered by the Lieutenant Colonel Shamsul Alam, who commanded the East Pakistan Detachment of the [[Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence]] (ISI). It was during this time that an officer of the [[East Bengal Regiment]], Rauf ur Rahman, who was in league with the conspirators made an attempt on Alam's life. Alam displayed great bravery and chased the would-be assassins; for this Alam was awarded the [[Sitara-e-Basalat]], the highest award for bravery in action during peacetime.

In all, 1,500 Bengalis were arrested in connection with the plot in 1967.&lt;ref name=banglapedia&gt;{{cite book |last=Begum |first=Shahida |year=2012 |chapter=Agartala Conspiracy Case |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Agartala_Conspiracy_Case |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1968 the Home Department of Pakistan declared that it had detected a scheme to destabilise Pakistan and break the Eastern wing through an armed revolt, and had arrested 8 people. Later on 18 January, the Department implicated Sheikh Mujib as well. He and others were arrested on 9 May 1968, and were subsequently released, only to be arrested later.&lt;ref name=banglapedia /&gt;

The existence of a conspiracy between Mujib and India for the secession of East Pakistan has not been proven&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZBs0HdpKuaQC|title=Pakistan: A Modern History|author=Ian Talbot|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0-312-21606-1|page=190|quote=The Agartala contacts however did not provide solid evidence of a Mujib-India secessionist conspiracy in East Pakistan, and in its absence the accusations were to prove extremely counterproductive given the prevailing political atmosphere.}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is now known that Mujib did secretly meet Indian officials in Agartala in July 1962 and there were secret meetings between the Awami League and Indian Government representatives after the 1965 war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZBs0HdpKuaQC|title=Pakistan: A Modern History|author=Ian Talbot|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0-312-21606-1|page=190|quote=It is now clear that Mujib did hold secret discussions with local Indian leaders there in July 1962. Moreover, following the 1965 war there were meetings between Awami League leaders and representatives of the Indian Government at a number of secret locations.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trials==
Pakistan decided to try the accused by [[court-martial]] since a lot of the accused involved military personnel. However, this was overturned in favour of a [[civil trial]] to implicate the politicians ahead of the [[Pakistani general election, 1970|1970 elections]] as well as to provide transparency of the trials. Hence, only 35 were finally accused. The accused were then moved from [[Dhaka Central Jail]] to the secured borders of the [[Dhaka Cantonment]].&lt;ref name=banglapedia /&gt;

The penal codes were amended to benefit the prosecution of the accused, and the trial began on 19 June 1968 under a special tribunal. The hearings took place inside a secured chamber within the Dhaka Cantonment. The hearing became for Mujib an opportunity to publicise the Awami League demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZBs0HdpKuaQC|title=Pakistan: A Modern History|author=Ian Talbot|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0-312-21606-1|page=190|quote=Moreover, the hearing in open court presented Sheikh Mujib with the perfect platform to argue the Awami League cause.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charge sheet of 100 paragraphs were presented before the tribunal, with 227 witnesses and 7 approvers.&lt;ref name=banglapedia /&gt;

The tribunal was headed by 3 judges – the chair, Justice SA Rahman was a non-Bengali; the other members MR Khan and [[Maksum-ul-Hakim]] were Bengalis. The government was represented by the [[Attorney General]] TH Khan and former Foreign Minister Manzur Quader. Thomas Williams, a British lawyer, along with local attorneys challenged the formation of the tribunal by filing a petition in favour of Sheikh Mujib.&lt;ref name=banglapedia /&gt; The approvers appeared in the witness box and testified that they provided false evidence under the coercion of the State.&lt;ref name=banglapedia /&gt;

Members of public looked at the case as a conspiracy of the Pakistan government against the political [[Pakistan movement|autonomy movement of East Pakistan]], especially since the government was keen to prove that Sheikh Mujib was an Indian agent and a separatist. They organised mass movement and demanded immediate withdrawal of the case and release of all prisoners.&lt;ref name=banglapedia /&gt; According to the government decision, the final date for the case was 6 February 1969. However, because of the mass upsurge of 1969, the government had to defer the date.&lt;ref name=banglapedia /&gt;

In the morning of 15 February 1969, a Pakistani habildar shot point blank at Sergeant Zahurul Haq at the door of his jail cell, and killed him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZBs0HdpKuaQC|title=Pakistan: A Modern History|author=Ian Talbot|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0-312-21606-1|page=190|quote=The popular hostility evoked by the case peaked when one of the defendants, Seargeant Zahurul Haq, was murdered while in custody.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The news of the killing led a furious mob to set fire to the State Guest House and other government buildings,&lt;ref name=banglapedia /&gt; where the chief lawyer for the government and the Chair of the tribunal resided. They vacated secretly. Some of the case files and evidence got burnt as a result of the arson.&lt;ref name=banglapedia /&gt;

In the face of mass movement, the government withdrew the Agartala Conspiracy Case on 22 February 1969.&lt;ref name=banglapedia /&gt; The accused were released on the following day and the [[Paltan#Paltan Maidan|Race course Maidan]] saw a grand reception of the accused, where Sheikh Mujib was given his famous title ''[[Bangabandhu]]''.&lt;ref name=banglapedia /&gt;

==Aftermath==
Angry protesters formed an action committee. This popular hostility forced Aub Khan to withdraw the case and convene a Round Table Conference which Sheikh Mujib triumphantly attended but walked out of when his Six-Point demands were ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZBs0HdpKuaQC|title=Pakistan: A Modern History|author=Ian Talbot|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0-312-21606-1|page=190|quote=In a by now familiar pattern, students led the protests forming an Action Committee with its own 11-Point Programme. Ayub attempted to placate the rising tide of anger by dropping the case and convening a Round Table Conference. Sheikh Mujib triumphantly emerged from prison to represent the Awami League at the Conference, but he walked out when its demands for full provincial autonomy were ignored.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case and the resulting uprising was a major factor in the fall of Ayub Khan's government&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZBs0HdpKuaQC|title=Pakistan: A Modern History|author=Ian Talbot|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0-312-21606-1|page=190|quote=The continuing disturbances in the eastern wing played an important role in the toppling of the Ayub regime.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is also seen as one of the major events leading to ''Bengali nationalism'' and the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Badrul Ahsan |first=Syed |date=February 2007 |title=February 1969: Revisiting the Agartala Conspiracy Case |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/forum/2007/february/feb69.htm |work=Forum |publisher=The Daily Star |accessdate=2 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sergeant [[Zahurul Haq]] were honoured by the naming of a students' residential hall of the [[University of Dhaka]] after him.&lt;ref name=duhall&gt;{{cite news |date=16 February 2011 |title=35 'accused' honoured |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=174435 |newspaper=The Daily Star |accessdate=2 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, and on the anniversary of the withdrawal on 22 February 2011, surviving conspirator and Deputy Speaker of the [[Jatiyo Sangshad|Parliament]] [[Col. Shawkat Ali|Shawkat Ali]] confessed to the parliament at a point of order that the charges read out to them were accurate, stating that they formed a ''Shangram Parishad'' (Action Committee) under [[Sheikh Mujib]] for the secession of [[East Pakistan]].&lt;ref name=true&gt;{{cite news |date=23 February 2011 |title='Agartala conspiracy case was not false' |url=http://www.bdnews24.com/details.php?id=188118&amp;cid=2 |newspaper=BDNews24.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319055449/http://www.bdnews24.com/details.php?id=188118&amp;cid=2 |archive-date=19 March 2012 |accessdate=2 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=truthshawkat /&gt;

Parliamentarian [[Tofael Ahmed]] added that had the case not been filed, the plot would have culminated in the secession of East Pakistan without bloodshed, and credit the Deputy Speaker for planning the liberation of the nation.&lt;ref name=true /&gt;

The '''Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986''', sometimes referred to as '''ASPA''', is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] (1986 c. 14) passed in 1986, which regulates the use of animals used for research in the UK. The Act permits [[Animal testing|studies]] to be conducted using animals for procedures such as breeding genetically modified animals, medical and veterinary advances, education, environmental toxicology and includes procedures requiring [[vivisection]], if certain criteria are met.&lt;ref name="ASPA 2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/116843/aspa-draft-guidance.pdf|title=Draft Guidance on the Operation of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 (as amended)|publisher=Home Office (UK)|year=2013|accessdate=July 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Revised legislation came into force on January 1, 2013.  The original act related to the 1986 EU Directive 86/609/EEC &lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31986L0609:EN:NOT Directive 86/609/EEC of 24 November 1986 on the approximation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States regarding the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes]&lt;/ref&gt; which was updated and replaced by [[EU Directive 2010/63/EU]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2010:276:0033:0079:EN:PDF Directive 2010/63/EU of 22 September 2010 on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, a Government [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|select committee]] inquiry described the Act as the "...tightest system of regulation in the world" in relation to the regulation of using animals for research.&lt;ref name=HoL&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldselect/ldanimal/150/15004.htm#a4|title=Select Committee on Animals In Scientific Procedures Report|publisher=Home Office (UK), The Stationery Office|year=2002|accessdate=July 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Prior to ASPA, the use of animals in the UK was regulated by the [[Cruelty to Animals Act 1876]], which enforced a licensing and inspection system for [[vivisection]]. Animal cruelty was previously regulated by the [[Protection of Animals Act 1911]] (now largely repealed) and more recently by the [[Animal Welfare Act 2006]], both of which outlaw the causing of "unnecessary suffering". Specific exemptions apply to experiments licensed under the 1986 Act.&lt;ref name=HoL/&gt;

== History and scope ==
The 1986 Act defined ''regulated procedures'' as animal experiments that could potentially cause "pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm", to ''protected animals'', which encompassed all living [[vertebrate]]s other than humans, under the responsibility of humans. A 1993 [[law|amendment]] added a single invertebrate species, the [[common octopus]] (''Octopus vulgaris''), as a protected animal.&lt;ref name="Octopus_ Amendment"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1993/2103/made | title=The Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act (Amendment) Order 1993 | date=August 23, 1993 | accessdate=February 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act applied only to protected animals from halfway through their [[gestation]] or incubation periods (for mammals, birds and reptiles) or from when they became capable of independent feeding (for fish, amphibians and, the common octopuses). [[Primate]]s, [[cat]]s, [[dog]]s and [[horse]]s had additional protection over other vertebrates under the Act.

Revised legislation came into force on January 1, 2013. The Act has been expanded to protect -
''{{centered pull quote|...all living vertebrates, other than man, and any living [[cephalopod]]. Fish and amphibia are protected once they can feed independently and cephalopods at the point when they hatch. Embryonic and foetal forms of mammals, birds and reptiles are protected during the last third of their gestation or incubation period.''}}

The definition of regulated procedures was expanded to -
{{centered pull quote|''A procedure is regulated if it is carried out on a protected animal and may cause that animal a level of pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm equivalent to, or higher than, that caused by inserting a hypodermic needle according to good veterinary practice.''}}

ASPA also regulates the modification of genes in protected animals if this causes the animal pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm.  Other considerations in the Act include [[Laboratory animal sources|animal sources]], housing conditions, identification methods and the humane killing of animals.&lt;ref name="ASPA 2013" /&gt; This legislation is widely regarded as the strictest in the world protecting animals used in research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.understandinganimalresearch.org.uk/how/regulation/|title=How Do We Do Research With Animals?:Regulations|publisher=Understanding Animal Research|accessdate=July 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those applying for a license must explain why such research cannot be done through non-animal or [[in-vitro]] methods. The project must also pass an ethical review panel which aims to decide if the potential benefits outweigh any suffering for the animals involved.

==Licences and certificates==
ASPA involves three levels of regulation &amp;mdash; person, project, and place.

The 'person' level is achieved by the granting of a "personal licence" (PIL, procedure personal licence) to a researcher wishing to carry out regulated procedures on a protected animal. Having undergone a defined sequence of training, a researcher can apply for a PIL permitting specified techniques to be carried out on named species of animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/guidance/research-and-testing-using-animals|title=Research and testing using animals - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'project' level of regulation is governed by the granting of a "project licence" (PPL) to a suitably qualified senior researcher. The PPL details the scope of the work to be carried out, the likely benefits that may be realised by the work, and the costs involved in terms of the numbers and types of animals to be used, and the harm that might be caused to the animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://speakingofresearch.com/2013/03/25/uk-regulations-how-do-you-get-a-licence-to-carry-out-animal-research/|title=UK Regulations: How do you get a licence to carry out animal research?|last=Editor|date=2013-03-25|website=Speaking of Research|access-date=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically a large and detailed document, the PPL precisely defines which techniques may be applied to particular animals and for what purpose.

Finally, the 'place' where regulated procedures are carried out is controlled by the granting of a "certificate of designation" (PCD) to a senior authority figure at the establishment, such as the [[Registrar (education)|Registrar]] or [[Vice-chancellor (education)|Vice-chancellor]] of a University, or the [[Chief executive officer]] of a commercial company. The PCD details which rooms in the establishment are permitted to be used for certain techniques and species, but may also apply to outdoors areas and even mobile areas (e.g. boats) if this is where the research is to be conducted.

It is an offence under ASPA to carry out regulated procedures on a protected animal unless authorised by a personal licence, a project licence, and a certificate of designation.

==Opinion==
A report by [[Animal Aid]] called the Act a "vivisectors' charter", alleging that it allows researchers to do as they please and makes them practically immune from prosecution. The report said that licences to perform experiments are obtained on the basis of a "nod of approval" from the Home Office Inspectorate, and that the Home Office relies on the researchers' own cost-benefit analysis of the value of the experiment versus the suffering caused.&lt;ref name=AAreport&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animalaid.org.uk/images/pdf/unhappy.pdf|title=Unhappy Anniversary: Twenty years of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986|publisher=Animal Aid|year=2006|accessdate=July 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Note: This document is now dated - several of the bans called for have been enacted)

A 2002 [[House of Lords]] select committee inquiry compared the Act to legislation from France, the U.S., and Japan. The report concluded that "virtually all witnesses agreed that the UK has the tightest system of regulation in the world" and that it is "the only country to require an explicit [[cost/benefit]] assessment of every application to conduct animal research."&lt;ref name=HoL/&gt;  Note that costs are explicitly in terms of adverse effects on animals, not the financial cost to the experimenters.

In 2005, [[Patricia Hewitt]], then British [[Secretary of State for Trade and Industry]], called the Act "[among] the strongest laws in the world to protect animals which are being used for medical research."&lt;ref name=BBC1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4222057.stm|title=Head to head: Laws on activists|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=July 30, 2013|date=31 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Campaignbox Crusades Battles}}
In the '''Battle of ''Ager Sanguinis''''', also known as the '''Battle of the Field of Blood''', the '''Battle of Sarmada''', or the '''Battle of Balat''', [[Roger of Salerno]]'s Crusader army of the [[Principality of Antioch]] was annihilated by the army of [[Ilghazi|Ilghazi of Mardin]], the [[Artuqid]] ruler of [[Aleppo]] on June 28, 1119.

==Background==
[[Antioch]] and the other [[Crusader States]] were constantly at war with the Muslim states of Northern [[Syria]] and [[Al Jazira, Mesopotamia|the Jazeerah]], principally Aleppo and [[Mosul]]. When [[Ridwan of Aleppo]] died in 1113, there was a period of peace, at least for a few years. However, [[Roger of Salerno]], who was ruling Antioch as regent for [[Bohemond II of Antioch|Bohemond II]], did not take advantage of Ridwan's death; likewise, [[Baldwin II of Edessa|Baldwin II]], [[county of Edessa|count of Edessa]], and [[Pons of Tripoli|Pons]], [[county of Tripoli|count of Tripoli]], looked after their own interests and did not ally with Roger against Aleppo. In 1115, Roger defeated a [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]] Turkish invasion force led by [[Bursuq ibn Bursuq]] at the [[Battle of Sarmin]].

In 1117 Aleppo came under the rule of the Artuqid [[atabeg]] [[Ilghazi]].{{sfn|Stevenson|1907|p=102}} In 1118 Roger captured [[Azaz]], which left Aleppo open to attack from the Crusaders; in response, Ilghazi invaded the Principality in 1119.{{sfn|Stevenson|1907|p=103}} Roger marched out from [[Artah]] with [[Bernard of Valence]], the [[Latin Patriarch of Antioch]].{{sfn|Stevenson|1907|p=103}} Bernard suggested they remain there, as Artah was a well-defended fortress only a short distance away from Antioch, and Ilghazi would not be able to pass if they were stationed there. The [[Patriarch]] also advised Roger to call for help from Baldwin, now [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|king of Jerusalem]], and Pons, but Roger felt he could not wait for them to arrive.

Roger camped in the pass of [[Sarmada]], while Ilghazi besieged the fort of [[Atarib|al-Atharib]].{{sfn|Stevenson|1907|p=104}} A force under Robert of Vieux-Pont set out to break the siege, and Ilghazi feigned a retreat, Robert's men were drawn out from the fort and ambushed.{{sfn|Stevenson|1907|p=104}}

==The battle==
Ilghazi was also waiting for reinforcements from [[Toghtekin]], the [[Burid]] emir of [[Damascus]], but he too was tired of waiting.{{sfn|Stevenson|1907|p=104}} Using little-used paths, his army quickly surrounded Roger's camp during the night of June 27.{{sfn|Stevenson|1907|p=104}} The prince had recklessly chosen a campsite in a wooded valley with steep sides and few avenues of escape.{{sfn|Stevenson|1907|p=104}} Roger's army of 700 knights, 500 Armenian cavalry and 3,000 foot soldiers, including [[turcopoles]], hastily formed into five divisions.{{sfn|Stevenson|1907|p=103–104}} These drew up in a V-shaped line with the tip farthest from the Muslim battle array. From left to right, the divisions were commanded by Robert of St. Lo, Prince Roger, Guy de Frenelle, Geoffrey the Monk and Peter. Meanwhile, Roger told off a sixth division under Renaud Mansoer to protect the Antiochene rear.&lt;ref&gt;Smail, p 179&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Muslim army waited, the ''qadi'' [[ibn al-Khashshab|Abu al-Fadl ibn al-Khashshab]], wearing his lawyer's turban but brandishing a lance, rode out in front of the troopers. At first they were incredulous at being harangued by a scholar but at the end of his passionate evocation of the duties and merits of the [[jihad]] warrior, according to Kamal ad-Din, the contemporary historian of Aleppo, these hardened professionals wept with emotion and rode into battle.

That morning, June 28, the battle was begun by an archery duel between the Antiochene infantry, posted in front of the knights, and the Turkish bowmen. The crusader army was at first successful when the right-hand divisions of Peter and Geoffrey the Monk attacked and defeated the Artuqids opposed to them. Guy de Frenelle's center division had some success also, but the battle was soon decided on the left flank.&lt;ref&gt;Smail, p 180&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Robert of St. Lo]] and the [[Turcopoles]] were driven back into Roger's division, disrupting it. A north wind blew dust in the faces of the Antioch knights and footmen, confusing them further.{{sfn|Stevenson|1907|p=104}} Soon, Artuqid flanking forces enveloped the crusaders.{{sfn|Stevenson|1907|p=104}}

During the fighting, Roger was killed by a sword in the face at the foot of the great [[Crux gemmata|jewelled cross]] which had served as his standard.{{sfn|Stevenson|1907|p=104}} The rest of the army was killed or captured; only two knights survived. Renaud Mansoer, took refuge in the fort of Sarmada to wait for King Baldwin, but was later taken captive by Ilghazi. Among the other prisoners was likely [[Walter the Chancellor]], who later wrote an account of the battle. The massacre led to the name of the battle, ''ager sanguinis'', [[Latin]] for "the field of blood."

==Aftermath==
The battle proved that the Muslims could defeat a Crusader army without the help of the [[Seljuk Turks|Seljuks]]. However, Ilghazi soon went on an alcoholic binge&lt;ref name="Smail, p 30"&gt;Smail, p 30&lt;/ref&gt; and did not advance to Antioch, where Patriarch Bernard was organizing whatever defense he could. Even so, because of the loss of the Antiochene field army, Atharib, [[Zardana|Zerdana]], [[Sarmin]], [[Ma'arrat al-Numan]] and [[Kafartab|Kafr Tab]] rapidly fell into Muslim hands.&lt;ref name="Smail, p 30"/&gt;

Ilghazi was defeated by [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem]] and Count Pons at the [[Battle of Hab]] on August 14, and Baldwin took over the regency of Antioch.{{sfn|Stevenson|1907|p=105}} Subsequently, Baldwin recovered some of the lost towns.{{sfn|Stevenson|1907|p=106}} Even so, the defeat at the Field of Blood left Antioch severely weakened, and subject to repeated attacks by the Muslims in the following decade.  Eventually, the Principality came under the influence of a resurgent [[Byzantine Empire]].

The Crusaders regained some of their influence in Syria at the [[Battle of Azaz (1125)|Battle of Azaz]] six years later in 1125.

The description ''ager sanguinis'' is possibly a [[Bible|Biblical]] reference to the field purchased by [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] with the money he had been given to betray [[Christ]]. The [[Acts of the Apostles]] records that Judas killed himself in the field, and it was thus known as ''acheldemach'' in [[Aramaic]], and ''ager sanguinis'' in the [[Vulgate]].
===Casualties===
The Turks captured 70 knights and 500 soldiers of inferior rank. The high-ranking prisoners were [[ransom]]ed and 30 men who could not pay their way out were executed.{{sfn|Stevenson|1907|p=104}}

{{Campaignbox Campaigns of Cyrus the Great}}
The '''Battle of the Persian Border''' was the second encounter between the forces of [[Medes|Media]] and [[Persia]]. Though not a [[decisive victory]] for Persia, it signaled the diminishing power of Media in [[Southwest Asia]]. It was the first battle [[Cambyses I]] had fought in, and the first which he had fought with his son, [[Cyrus the Great]].  The first major battle, which lasted two days, was an attempt to bring freedom to Persia. It also prompted the Persians to retire south, and fight a third battle.&lt;br /&gt; It was narrated by [[Nicolaus of Damascus]], and among others who also mentioned the [[Battle of Hyrba]], but [[Herodotus]] does not mention this battle.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ctesias]] (Persica)&lt;/ref&gt; Most [[historian]]s on the battle consider Herodotus to be mentioning only the first and last battles in the war, which is partly based on the description of his two battles.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ms30qA6nyMsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=political+history+of+the+achaemenid+empire&amp;sig=ACfU3U2A01Dn5NNQWAQOht1I6iIi4KiHCg#PPA17,M1 M. A. Dandamaev, ''A Political History of the Achaemenid Empire'', tr. W. J. Vogelsang, (1989)] p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; At the border this became the first major battle between the two powers.&lt;ref&gt;Fragments of [[Nicolaus of Damascus]]&lt;/ref&gt; Cyrus managed to escape the enemy without retreating, thus ending the battle and prolonging the struggle without a complete victory for [[Astyages]], the king of the Medes.  The next battle became the last stand for the Persians; as their very existence relied on the outcome of the war, which had to be won.

==Background==
Cyrus had retired to the border of the Median [[province]] to protect the Persian border against Astyages.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, W.B., Ilya Gershevitch, and Ehsan Yarshster, ''The Cambridge History of Iran'', Cambridge University Press (1993) p. 147. In 1 volume&lt;/ref&gt; After the Battle of Hyrba Astyages invaded Persia.&lt;ref&gt;Chisholm, Hugh, ''The Encyclopædia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information'', Cambridge, England; New York: At the University Press, (1910) p.208&lt;/ref&gt; The battle that was to come was composed of [[cavalry]] from both sides, and [[chariot]]s that in most part were used for the battle, for they were never used again.&lt;ref&gt;Laymon, Charles M., ''The Interpreter's One Volume Commentary on the Bible: Introduction and Commentary'', Abingdon Press, (1971) p.440. In 1 volume&lt;/ref&gt; A small part of the invasion force from the Medes participated in the battle, while the Persians spent all their cavalry from their reserves.&lt;ref&gt;Laymon, Charles M., ''The Interpreter's One Volume Commentary on the Bible: Introduction and Commentary'', Abingdon Press, (1971) p.441. In 1 volume&lt;/ref&gt; Astyages had tried to persuade Cyrus to surrender but he now preferred to show no mercy even though he had better relations with Atradates (the variant name of Herodotus' [[Cyrus the Great#Mitradates|Mitradates]], which Nicolaus mistakenly uses for [[Cambyses I|Cambyses]], the father of Cyrus).{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}  The name of the city Cyrus and his father were protecting was not given.&lt;ref&gt;Laymon, Charles M., ''The Interpreter's One Volume Commentary on the Bible: Introduction and Commentary'', Abingdon Press, (1971) p.442. In 1 volume&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, the city was an important [[frontier]] town worth the protection.&lt;ref&gt;Clare, Israel Smith. ''The unrivaled history of the world, containing a full and complete record of the human race from the earliest historical period to the present time, embracing a general survey of the progress of mankind in national and social life, civil government, religion, literature, science and art''... Chicago, The Werner Co., (1893) p.244. In 4 editions&lt;/ref&gt; When Astyages came within reach of the city, Persian civilians were ready to evacuate if necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Duncker, Max, ''The History of Antiquity'', tr. Evelyn Abbott, p. 350. London, Richard Bentley * Son (1881) p. 350&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, Cyrus and Cambyses assembled the army, but it is not exactly known whether [[Oebares]] (who helped Cyrus to the [[throne]]) or Harpagus participated on the side of Cyrus in the battle, it is known that the original Oebares was an advisor to Cyrus.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, W.B., Ilya Gershevitch, and Ehsan Yarshster, ''The Cambridge History of Iran'', Cambridge University Press (1993) p. 149. In 1 volume&lt;/ref&gt; So Nicolaus, as he is known to change names around, may most likely be saying [[Harpagus]] was in the battle, as he was historically Cyrus's second in command and the only other choice available, but in this battle it seems Oebares was on Cyrus' side.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} Then it could also be said as Herodotus mentions, Harpagus was the most likely candidate that was in this battle that occurred about a year after the first battle.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}  Therefore, as battle began, Astyages had his special [[troop]]s positioned to attack at the [[Rear (military)|rear]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

==Motives==
{{cquote|Cyrus encouraged the Persians, and Oebares seized the [[Mountain pass|pass]]es of the mountain and the [[height]]s, built lines, and brought the people from the open cities into such as were well [[fortified]]. Astyages burned down the abandoned cities, summoned Atradates and Cyrus to [[submission]], and taunted them with their former beggary. Cyrus replied that Astyages did not recognize the power of the gods, which forced them, goat-herds as they were, to accomplish what was destined to be done. As he had done them kindness, they bade him lead back the Medes, and give their freedom to the Persians who were better than the Medes.|||Nicolaus' Fragments&lt;ref&gt;Duncker, Max, ''The History of Antiquity'', tr. Evelyn Abbott, p. 350.  London, Richard Bentley * Son (1881) p. 350.1-350.4&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

==Battle==
{{cquote|Thus it came to a battle. Astyages, surrounded by 20,000 of his [[bodyguard]], looked on: among the Persians Atradates had the right, and Oebares the left [[wing]], Cyrus, surrounded by the bravest [[warrior]]s, was in the center. The Persians defended themselves bravely, and slew many of the Medes, so that Astyages cried out on his throne: 'How bravely these "terebinth-eaters" fight!' But at length the Persians were overpowered by numbers, and driven into the city before which they fought. Cyrus and Oebares advised to send the women and children to [[Pasargadae]], which is the loftiest mountain, and re-new the battle on the next day: 'If we are defeated we must all die, and if that must be so it is better to fall in [[victory]] and for the [[Political freedom|freedom]] of our [[country]].' Then all were filled with hatred and anger against the Medes, and when the morning came and the gates were opened, all marched out; Atradates alone remained with the old men in the city to defend the walls. But while Cyrus and Oebares were fighting in the field, Astyages caused 100,000 men to go round and attack the Persian army in the rear. The attack succeeded. Atradates fell covered with [[wound]]s into the hands of the Medes. Astyages said to him: 'An excellent satrap are you; is it thus that you thank me, you and your son, for what I have done for you?' Atradates, almost at the last gasp, replied: 'I know not, O king, what deity has roused this frenzy in my son; put me not to the [[torture]], I shall soon die.' Astyages had compassion on him and said: 'I will not put you to the torture; I know that if your son had followed your advice, he would not have done such things.' Atradates died, and Astyages gave him an honorable burial.|||Nicolaus' Fragments&lt;ref&gt;Duncker, Max, ''The History of Antiquity'', tr. Evelyn Abbott, p. 350.  London, Richard Bentley * Son (1881) p. 350.5-351.7&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

==Aftermath==
After the first days battle the Persians had either inflicted massive casualties on Astyages' personal guard that was made up of cavalry, or the rest of his army that was also cavalry. Nevertheless, the Persians still claimed victory the first day. The second day of the battle Cyrus, assuming the battle had ended, secretly retired south with the rest of the armed forces, while only Cambyses and a few old men remained in the city. When Cyrus was forced to fight again, Astyages' ingenious move of cavalry occurred, which was aimed at capturing the poorly guarded city. As he was assuming the battle had not ended, he easily captured the city, while only Cambyses is reported to have been wounded and later died. It is debated among today's historians if the second day is to be counted as part of the original battle, or that it should be counted as a separate battle.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ms30qA6nyMsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=political+history+of+the+achaemenid+empire&amp;sig=ACfU3U2A01Dn5NNQWAQOht1I6iIi4KiHCg#PPA17,M1+ M. A. Dandamaev, ''A Political History of the Achaemenid Empire'', tr. W. J. Vogelsang, (1989)] p. 17-18&lt;/ref&gt; As the Persians retired south, Astyages readily abandoned the city, which is based partly on the scant sources from Nicolaus, therefore not becoming a complete victory for Astyages, as he is not known to put a garrison there after he and his forces went south after the Persians. It was however a psychological blow to the Medes as they thought the Persians were lucky in the first battle, but again the Persians won, this time [[military tactics|tactical]]ly. Both armies later went back to their camps and organized their armies while deciding where to meet for the next fight. Then as the year passed, both forces agreed to meet at the Persian capital which Astyages wished to capture.

{{nihongo|'''Obon'''|[[wiktionary:お盆|お盆]]}} or just {{nihongo|'''Bon'''|盆}} is a Japanese [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] custom to honor the spirits of one's ancestors. This Buddhist-Confucian custom has evolved into a family reunion holiday during which people return to ancestral family places and visit and clean their ancestors' graves, and when the spirits of ancestors are supposed to revisit the household altars. It has been celebrated in Japan for more than 500 years and traditionally includes a dance, known as Bon-Odori.

The festival of Obon lasts for three days; however its starting date varies within different regions of Japan. When the [[lunar calendar]] was changed to the [[Gregorian calendar]] at the beginning of the [[Meiji era]], the localities in Japan reacted differently and this resulted in three different times of Obon. "Shichigatsu Bon" ("Bon in July") is based on the solar calendar and is celebrated around 15 July in eastern Japan ([[Kantō region]] such as [[Tokyo]], [[Yokohama]] and the [[Tōhoku region]]), coinciding with [[Chūgen]]. "Hachigatsu Bon" (Bon in August) is based on the lunar calendar, is celebrated around the 15th of August and is the most commonly celebrated time. "Kyū Bon" (Old Bon) is celebrated on the 15th day of the seventh month of the lunar calendar, and so differs each year. "Kyū Bon" is celebrated in areas like the northern part of the Kantō region, [[Chūgoku region]], [[Shikoku]], and the [[Okinawa Prefecture]]. These three days are not listed as public holidays but it is customary that people are given leave.&lt;ref&gt;Bon A-B-C, 2002, Bonodori.net, Japan,  http://www.bonodori.net/E/sekai/bonabc3.HTML {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/66B5Rxchr?url=http://www.bonodori.net/E/sekai/bonabc3.HTML# |date=2012-03-15 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
''Obon'' is a shortened form of [[Ghost Festival|''Ullambana'']] ({{lang-ja|于蘭盆會}} or {{lang|ja|盂蘭盆會}}, ''urabon'e''). It is [[Sanskrit]] for "hanging upside down" and implies great suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, K 1968, ‘Filial Piety in Chinese Buddhism’, Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies, p88.&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese believe they should ameliorate the suffering of the "Urabanna".{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

''Bon Odori'' originates from the story of [[Maudgalyayana|Maha Maudgalyayana (Mokuren)]], a disciple of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], who used his supernatural powers to look upon his deceased mother.  He discovered she had fallen into the Realm of [[Preta|Hungry Ghosts]] and was suffering.&lt;ref&gt;What is Obon, 1998, Shingon Buddhist International Institute, California, http://www.shingon.org/library/archive/Obon.html.&lt;/ref&gt; Greatly disturbed, he went to the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] and asked how he could release his mother from this realm. Buddha instructed him to make offerings to the many Buddhist monks who had just completed their summer retreat, on the fifteenth day of the seventh month. The disciple did this and, thus, saw his mother's release. He also began to see the true nature of her past selflessness and the many sacrifices that she had made for him. The disciple, happy because of his mother's release and grateful for his mother's kindness, danced with joy. From this dance of joy comes '''Bon Odori''' or "Bon Dance", a time in which ancestors and their sacrifices are remembered and appreciated. See also: [[Ullambana Sutra]].

As Obon occurs in the heat of the summer, participants traditionally wear [[yukata]], or light cotton [[kimono]]s. Many Obon celebrations include a huge carnival with rides, games, and summer festival food like watermelon.&lt;ref&gt;Obon: Japanese festival of the dead, 2000, Asia Society, http://www.asiasource.org/news/at_mp_02.cfm?newsid=27391 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302022535/http://www.asiasource.org/news/at_mp_02.cfm?newsid=27391# |date=2008-03-02 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Families sent their ancestors' spirits back to their permanent dwelling place under the guidance of fire: this rite was known as sending fire ([[Gozan no Okuribi|Okuribi]]). Fire also marks the commencement (Mukaebi) as well as the closing of the festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Death and Social Order in Tokugawa Japan: Buddhism, Anti-Christianity, and the Danka System|last = HUR|first = Nam-Lin|publisher = Harvard University Asia Center, 2007|year = |isbn = 9780674025035|location = |pages = 192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bon Odori==
[[File:Bon Odori Dancer.jpg|thumb|right|Bon Odori Dancers (August 2004 at Imazu Primary School in Osaka)]]

''Bon Odori'' ([[Japanese language|Japanese]]: [[:ja:盆踊り|盆踊り]]), meaning simply ''Bon dance'', is a style of dancing performed during Obon. Originally a [[Nenbutsu]] folk dance to welcome the [[spirit]]s of the dead, the style of celebration varies in many aspects from region to region. Each region has a local dance, as well as different music. The music can be songs specifically pertinent to the spiritual message of Obon, or local [[min'yō]] folk songs. Consequently, the Bon dance will look and sound different from region to region. [[Hokkaidō]] is known for a folk-song known as "[[Sōran Bushi]]". The song "[[Tokyo]] Ondo" takes its namesake from the capital of Japan. "Gujo Odori" in [[Gujō, Gifu|Gujō]] in [[Gifu Prefecture]] is famous for all night dancing. "[[Goshu Ondo|Gōshū Ondo]]" is a folk song from [[Shiga Prefecture]]. Residents of the Kansai area will recognize the famous "[[Kawachi ondo]]". [[Tokushima]] in [[Shikoku]] is very famous for its "[[Awa Odori]]", and in the far south, one can hear the "Ohara Bushi" of [[Kagoshima]].

The way in which the dance is performed is also different in each region, though the typical Bon dance involves people lining up in a circle around a high wooden scaffold made especially for the festival called a ''[[Yagura (tower)|yagura]]''. The yagura is usually also the bandstand for the musicians and singers of the Obon music. Some dances proceed clockwise, and some dances proceed counter-clockwise around the yagura. Some dances reverse during the dance, though most do not. At times, people face the yagura and move towards and away from it. Still some dances, such as the Kagoshima Ohara dance, and the Tokushima Awa Odori, simply proceed in a straight line through the streets of the town.

The dance of a region can depict the area's history and specialization. For example, the movements of the dance of the [[Tankō Bushi]] (the "coal mining song") of old [[Miike Mine]] in Kyushu show the movements of miners, i.e. digging, cart pushing, lantern hanging, etc.; the above-mentioned Soran Bushi mimics the work of fishermen such as hauling in the nets. All dancers perform the same dance sequence in unison.

There are other ways in which a regional Bon dance can vary. Some dances involve the use of different kinds of fans, others involve the use of small towels called ''tenugui'' which may have colorful designs. Some require the use of small wooden clappers, or "kachi-kachi" during the dance. The "Hanagasa Odori" of Yamagata is performed with a straw hat that has been decorated with flowers.

The music that is played during the Bon dance is not limited to Obon music and [[min'yō]]; some modern [[enka]] hits and kids' tunes written to the beat of the "[[Ondo (music)|ondo]]" are also used to dance to during Obon season.

The Bon dance tradition is said to have started in the later years of the [[Muromachi period]] as a public entertainment. In the course of time, the original religious meaning has faded, and the dance has become associated with summer.

The Bon dance performed in the [[Okinawa Islands]] is known as ''[[Eisa (dance)|eisā]]''. Similarly, the [[Yaeyama Islands]] have ''[[Angama (Yaeyama)|Angama]]''.

== Celebrations outside Japan ==

=== Argentina ===
In [[Argentina]], the Bon Festival is celebrated by Japanese communities during the summer of the southern hemisphere. The biggest festival is held in Colonia Urquiza, in [[La Plata Partido|La Plata]]. It takes place on the sports ground of the La Plata Japanese School. The festival also includes ''[[taiko]]'' shows and typical dances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eldia.com.ar/edis/20110109/tapa6.htm "Una tradición que se afirma en la Ciudad"], El Día, Sunday, January 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brazil ===

Bon Odori Festival is celebrated every year in many Japanese communities all over [[Brazil]], as Brazil is home to the largest Japanese population outside Japan. [[São Paulo]] is the main  city of the Japanese community in Brazil, and also features the major festival in Brazil, with street [[Japanese traditional dance|odori]] dancing and [[matsuri]] dance. It also features [[Taiko]] and [[Shamisen]] contests. And of course, this festival is also a unique experience of a variety of Japanese food &amp; drinks, art and dance.

=== China ===
{{main|Ghost Festival}}

=== Korea ===
The Korean version of the Bon celebration is known as [[Baekjung]]. Participants present offerings at Buddhist shrines and temples, and masked dances are performed. It is as much an agricultural festival as a religious one.&lt;ref name="MobileReference2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=MobileReference|title=Encyclopedia of Observances, Holidays and Celebrations from MobileReference|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5VhTa1Eiq7oC&amp;pg=PT490|accessdate=2 April 2013|year=2007|publisher=MobileReference|isbn=978-1-60501-177-6|page=490}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cho2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dong-Il Cho|title=Korean Mask Dance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dxHQqLz5HBUC&amp;pg=PT49|accessdate=2 April 2013|year=2005|publisher=Ewha Womans University Press|isbn=978-89-7300-641-0|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Malaysia ===
In [[Malaysia]], Bon Odori Festivals are also celebrated every year in Esplanade (Padang Kota Lama) [[Penang]], Matsushita Corp Stadium in [[Shah Alam]], [[Selangor]], and also [[Universiti Malaysia Sabah]] at [[Kota Kinabalu]], [[Sabah]]. This celebration, which is a major attraction for the state of Selangor, is the brain child of the Japanese Expatriate &amp; Immigrant's Society in Malaysia. In comparison to the celebrations in Japan, the festival is celebrated on a much smaller scale in Penang, Selangor and Sabah, and is less associated with Buddhism and more with Japanese culture. Held mainly to expose locals to a part of Japanese culture, the festival provides the experience of a variety of Japanese food and drinks, art and dance, with the vast number of Japanese companies in Malaysia taking part to promote their products.

=== United States and Canada ===
Bon Odori festivals are also celebrated in [[North America]], particularly by Japanese-Americans or Japanese-Canadians affiliated with Buddhist temples and organizations. [[Buddhist Churches of America]] (BCA) temples in the U.S. typically celebrate Bon Odori with both religious Obon observances and traditional Bon Odori dancing around a [[Yagura (tower)|yagura]]. Many temples also concurrently hold a cultural and food bazaar providing a variety of cuisine and art, also to display features of Japanese culture and Japanese-American history.&lt;ref&gt;Nakao, Annie, [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/07/08/PNGNHDCEJA1.DTL "Japanese Americans keeping Obon tradition alive"], San Francisco Chronicle, Friday, July 8, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Performances of [[taiko]] by both amateur and professional groups have recently become a popular feature of Bon Odori festivals.&lt;ref&gt;Schulze, Margaret, [http://www.taiko.org/obon/obon_basics_nikkei.html "Obon Story: Honoring ancestors, connecting to our community"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807063049/http://www.taiko.org/obon/obon_basics_nikkei.html |date=2007-08-07 }}, in the ''Nikkei West'' newspaper, San Jose, California, Vol. 10, No. 14, July 25th, 2002 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taiko.org/obon/obon_basics.html "Obon Basics"] - San Jose [[Taiko]], California {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808033436/http://www.taiko.org/obon/obon_basics.html |date=August 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bon Odori festivals are usually scheduled anytime between July and September.
Bon Odori melodies are also similar to those in Japan; for example, the dance [[Tankō Bushi]] from [[Kyushu]] is also performed in the U.S. In California, due to the diffusion of Japanese immigration, Bon Odori dances also differ from Northern to Southern California, and some are influenced by American culture, such as "Baseball Ondo".

[[File:Bon Dance in Keei, Hawaii.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Even Ke'ei, a remote place, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hawaii.com/big-island/beaches/keei/|title=Keei Beach: Kona's Best-Kept Secret - Hawaii.com|author=|date=|website=hawaii.com|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the western side of [[Hawaii (island)|Hawaii]], comes alive when bon dance is held under the [[Albizia saman|monkey pod tree]] of the Buddhist mission &amp; cemetery every August. ]]
The "Bon season" is an important part of the present-day culture and life of [[Hawaii]]. It was brought there by the plantation workers from Japan, and now the bon dance events are held among the five major islands ([[Kauai]], [[Oahu]], [[Molokai]], [[Maui]] and [[Hawaii (island)|Hawaii]]) on weekend evenings from June to August. They are held usually at [[Buddhist]] missions, but sometimes at [[Shintoist]] missions or at shopping centers.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.honolulumagazine.com/Honolulu-Magazine/June-2016/Hawaii-Summer-2016-Bon-Dance-Schedule/|title=Hawai‘i Summer 2016 Bon Dance Schedule|author=|date=|website=honolulumagazine.com|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.staradvertiser.com/features/obon-season/|title=2016 Obon season calendar|author=|date=29 May 2016|website=staradvertiser.com|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At some Buddhist missions, the dance is preceded by a simple ritual where the families of the deceased in the past year burn incense for remembrance, but otherwise the event is non-religious. The songs played differ among the regions --- one or two hour bon dance in the western part of the Big Island (in and around [[Kailua Kona]]), for example, typically starts with ''[[Tankō Bushi]]'', continues with songs such as ''[[Kawachi, Osaka|Kawachi]] Otoko [[Bushi_(music)|Bushi]]'' (using wooden clappers), ''[[Yukata]] Odori'' (using the towels given at the donation desk), ''Asatoya Yunta'' and ''Ashibina'' from [[Okinawa Prefecture]] (reflecting the fact that many Okinawan descendants live in Hawaii), ''[[Pokémon]] [[Ondo (music)|Ondo]]'' for children, [[zumba]] songs for the young, ''[[Beautiful Sunday (song)|Beautiful Sunday]]'', etc., and ends with ''[[Fukushima Prefecture|Fukushima]] Ondo'' celebrating abundant harvest.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4BhRpA4584|title=Fukushima Ondo (福島音頭)|first=|last=warubozu047|date=23 December 2010|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2018|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; The participants, Japanese descendants and the people of all races, dance in a big circle around the [[Yagura (tower)|yagura]], the central tower set up for the dance, from which recorded songs are broadcast and, most of the time, the [[taiko]] group accompany the songs playing drums. In larger cities, bon dance lessons are given by volunteers before the actual events. &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.bonodori.net/kaigai/hawaii/102.htm Bon Dance Overseas --- Hawaii (in ten web pages)] (in Japanese) &lt;/ref&gt;

Some Japanese museums may also hold Obon festivals, such as the [[Morikami Museum and Japanese Gardens|Morikami Japanese Museum]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://morikami.org/cultural-programs/lantern-festival/|title=Lantern Festival: In The Spirit Of Obon – Morikami Museum and Japanese Gardens|author=|date=|website=morikami.org|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Florida.

In St. Louis Missouri the Botanical Garden has hosted a Bon festival over Labor Day weekend every year since 1977. Known as the Japanese festival it is a collaboration with several Japanese-American organizations. Hosting thousands of people over 3 days it provides authentic Japanese music, art, dance, food, and entertainment including dancing around a yagura, sumo wrestling, Taiko drums, Bonsai demonstrations, music played on traditional instruments, several bazaars, food courts with authentic Japanese foods, tea ceremonies, candlelit lanterns released on the lake in the gardens Japanese garden and much more.

=== Taiwan ===
It is also celebrated in the country of Taiwan, because of their Chinese influence and roots.

'''Busan International Motor Show''' ('''BIMOS'''), which first convened as the inaugural exhibition for [[BEXCO]] in 2001, is held biennially as part of efforts to promote the regional automotive industry and galvanize the local economy. The show has become an ultra-large scale event that routinely attracts more than one million visitors. The exhibition halls at BEXCO (measuring 26,508 square-meters) will house more than 170 cars and trucks on display. This number far exceeds the 109 cars and trucks that were displayed at the 2010 event, making this year’s Busan International Motor Show the largest ever in scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Korea’s 2012 Busan International Motor Show To Be Largest Ever|url=http://www.hybridcars.com/koreas-2012-busan-international-motor-show-be-largest-ever-45724/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2012==

The 6th Busan International Motor Show opened at BEXCO in the southern coastal city on Thursday featuring 22 domestic and foreign brands. More foreign brands showcase their models in this year's show than ever before, while domestic automakers try to draw visitors with modified versions of existing models as well as hybrid vehicles. Organizers expect around one million people to visit the show by the time it wraps up on June 3. Reflecting the theme of “The Voyage of the Green Car across the Ocean” adopted by the 2012 Busan International Motor Show, most automotive brands from Korea and elsewhere will spotlight their eco-friendly vehicles.

{{Garrison JFK investigation}}
==Contacts==
[[New Orleans]] attorney [[Dean Andrews Jr.]] testified to the [[Warren Commission]] on July 21, 1964 that he received a call from "Clay Bertrand," the day after the assassination of Kennedy, asking him to fly to [[Dallas]] to represent the suspected assassin, [[Lee Harvey Oswald]].&lt;ref name="WCH-XI"&gt;{{cite book |title=Hearings Before the President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy |url=http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?absPageId=20001 |accessdate=May 9, 2012 |volume=XI |date= |year=1964 |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=325–339 |chapter=Testimony of Dean Adams Andrews, Jr. |chapterurl=http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?absPageId=20335}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI had reported two weeks after the assassination that Andrews, who had been hospitalized with pneumonia, said he was under heavy sedation and had concluded that the call had been a "figment of his imagination".&lt;ref name="Mary Ferrell-FBI Files"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?docId=139369 |title=FBI Files - Shaw/Allen FOIA Cases: Dean Adams Andrews, Part 1 |date= |month= |year= |work=Mary Ferrell Foundation |publisher= |location= |pages=16–19, 87–89 |accessdate=May 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly three years later on March 2, 1967, the New Orleans district attorney [[Jim Garrison]] asserted that "Clay Bertrand" was actually New Orleans businessman [[Clay Shaw]] who had conspired with [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] and [[David Ferrie]] to kill Kennedy.&lt;ref name="Ellensburg Daily Record-March 3, 1967"&gt;{{cite news |title='Mystery Man' Revealed In Probe |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5NpOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=tUsDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1294%2C2812471 |agency=AP |newspaper=Ellensburg Daily Record |location=Ellensburg, Washington |date=March 3, 1967 |page=1 |accessdate=May 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shaw, who had been arrested and booked&lt;!-- not a formal charge under Louisiana law --&gt; with conspiracy to commit murder, denied that he had ever used the name.&lt;ref name="Ellensburg Daily Record-March 3, 1967"/&gt; An FBI document to President [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Lyndon Johnson]]'s advisor [[W. Marvin Watson]] at the time of this development indicated that they had been unable to locate an individual by the name "Clay Bertrand."&lt;ref name="Mary Ferrell-FBI Files"/&gt;

Shortly after appearing before the [[Orleans Parish]] [[grand jury]], Andrews stated in an interview on June 28, 1967 that "Bertrand" was not Shaw but was Eugene Davis, his friend and client.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Attorney Claims Shaw 'Never Was' Bertrand |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fWJSAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=w3sDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7201%2C4035060 |agency=AP |newspaper=St. Petersburg Times |location=St. Petersburg, Florida |date=June 29, 1967 |page=12-A |accessdate=May 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis denied in an affidavit that he was "Bertrand" or the person who suggested that Andrews go to Dallas to help Oswald.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Garrison Turns Guns On Critics |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xEVjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=VXQNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2875%2C1324400 |agency=UPI |newspaper=Star-News |location=Wilmington, North Carolina |date=July 9, 1967 |page=4A |accessdate=May 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrews was subsequently convicted on three counts of perjury for lying to the grand jury on August 14, 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Three Perjury Counts: Jury Convicts Dean Andrews |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KoNPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wVADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6741%2C1160219 |agency=AP |newspaper=Prescott Courier |location=Prescott, Arizona |date=August 14, 1967 |page=3 |accessdate=May 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 25, 1969, Andrews testified during the [[trial of Clay Shaw]] that the name "'Clay Bertrand' was a figment of [his] imagination" and that he had been "carrying on a farce" in order to prevent "bring[ing] a lot of heat and trouble to someone who didn't deserve it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Witness For Shaw Says He Made Up 'Clay Bertrand' |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fWJSAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=w3sDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7201%2C4035060 |agency=UPI |newspaper=St. Petersburg Times |location=St. Petersburg, Florida |date=February 26, 1969 |page=8-A |accessdate=May 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 1, 1969, the 34-day trial concluded when the jury acquitted Shaw after deliberating less than an hour.&lt;ref name="Evening Independent; March 1, 1969"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Unanimous Jury Clears Clay Shaw |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=950&amp;dat=19690301&amp;id=od0LAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=VlcDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5834,7182&amp;hl=en |newspaper=Evening Independent |volume=62 |issue=102 |location=St. Petersburg, Florida |agency=AP |page=1-A |date=March 1, 1969 |access-date=July 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Francisco das Chagas Rodrigues de Brito''' (born 1965 in [[Maranhão]]) is a [[Brazil]]ian [[serial killer]] and former mechanic, responsible for the deaths of at least 30 children in Maranhão and [[Pará]], notably [[emasculating]] his victims - his case garnered international repercussions as "a case of emasculated children of Maranhão."&lt;ref name=Rodrigues&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/cotidiano/ult95u92054.shtml|title=Mechaic confesses to the 17 murders of children in Maranhão|author=Kátia Brasil|publisher=Folha de S. Paulo|accessdate=February 2012|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Murders ==
The case of poor children being killed in the capital city of [[São Luís, Maranhão|São Luís]] was elucidated in 2004 with the murder of minor Jonahtan dos Santos, who, before disappearing, had said that he would meet with the mechanic.&lt;ref name=Rodrigues/&gt;

The suspect was arrested on suspicion of killing Jonahtan and 16 other boys, leading investigators to murders dating back from 1997, also in the municipalities of [[Paço do Lumiar]] and [[São José de Ribamar]]. Two bones were also found on the grounds of the house in which he lived.&lt;ref name=Rodrigues/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brito&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/cotidiano/ult95u624209.shtml|title=Mechanic is sentenced to 59 years imprisonment for killing and maiming boys in Maranhão|publisher=Folha de S. Paulo|date=15 September 2009|accessdate=February 2012|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lack of clarification on these homicides, carelessly treated for over the years, led Brazil to be denounced by organizations at the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]], of the [[Organization of American States|OAS]].&lt;ref name=Rodrigues/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brito/&gt;

De Brito's crimes also extended to the state of Pará, with a suspected total of 42 children being killed and emasculated.&lt;ref name=Brito/&gt;

In his crimes, the murderer, who exhibited psychopathic characteristics (sought to justify himself, lacked pity and lied), sexually abused his victims and, after killing them, mutilated them by cutting off their ears, fingers and then emasculating them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://veja.abril.com.br/100107/p_086.html|title="He killed, abused, mutilated"|author=Jerônimo Teixeira|publisher=Revista Veja|accessdate=February 2012|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''GlobalFest''' is an annual cultural celebration in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], [[Canada]].

The festival has been held every August since 2003,&lt;ref name="about"&gt;[http://www.globalfest.ca/About_GlobalFest.htm GlobalFest] - About GlobalFest&lt;/ref&gt; and is organized by ''The Calgary Fireworks Festival Society''.

GlobalFest consists of different components: the OneWorld Festival (with up to 24 Cultural Pavilions, 14 ethnic food kiosks, and a 12 vendor Night Market) and the International Fireworks Festival (with up to 6 fireworks presentations from up to 5 international teams).

==Human Rights Forum==
The GlobalFest Human Rights Forum presented by TD Bank Financial Group is a Calgary-based, week-long event that invites various speakers, guests, and experts to discuss pertinent issues relating to human rights and diversity. The Human Rights Forum seeks to build community dialogue by addressing various topics of racism and discrimination.

Informed by the aims of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and its International Coalition of Cities Against Racism Initiative, the Human Rights Forum aims to highlight the Canadian Coalition of Municipalities Against Racism and Discrimination’s (CCMARD) ten common commitments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.ca/en/commission/resources/documents/callcoalitioneng.pdf More information can be found in the CCMARD handbook] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706211124/http://www.unesco.ca/en/commission/resources/documents/callcoalitioneng.pdf |date=2011-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2010 Human Rights Forum took place from May 3 to 7 at the John Dutton Theatre within the Calgary Central Public Library.

The theme topic for the 2010 Human Rights Forum focused on Youth addressing the following commitments: 
*Increase vigilance against systemic and individual racism and discrimination.
*Support policing services in their efforts to be exemplary institutions in combating racism and discrimination.
*Inform and support individuals who experience racism and discrimination.
*Support measures to challenge racism and discrimination and promote diversity and equal opportunity in the education sector and in other forms of learning.
*Promote respect, understanding and appreciation of cultural diversity and the inclusion of Aboriginal and racialized communities into the cultural fabric of the municipality.

==Youth Forum==
The Human Rights Forum extended its programming in 2010 to include the '''GlobalFest Youth Forum''', an additional program that includes youth directly.  The 2010 GlobalFest Youth Forum featured UNITY Charity Presenting their "Hip Hop Away From Violence" program to five high schools in Calgary from April 26 to 30.

UNITY Charity is a youth led and artist driven anti-violence group from Toronto that specializes in urban performance assemblies and artistic workshops. UNITY seeks to provide positive artistic outlets for youth to express themselves instead of expressing themselves through violence, drug use, stereotyping, bullying and other negative forms of self-expression.

==Fireworks Festival==
The International [[Fireworks]] Festival is held at Elliston Park in Southeast Calgary and is presented by [[Trico Homes]]. Each night of the festival showcases a different nation. Participants attend by invitation of the organizers. Pyrotechnic displays take place over Elliston Park and are synchronized to music. Thus, these choreographed pyrotechnical arrangements are referred to as   'pyro-musicals'.

In 2009 the organizers introduced a variety of artistic requirements that all fireworks designers must incorporate into their designs. In past years the fireworks were presented in the style of a competition with a competitor being limited to winning two years in a row before a mandatory year-long break would be implemented. As of 2009, the pyro-musical presentations have been presented in a festival process rather than as a competition. This new process has been introduced to better meet artistic and funding criteria set forward by various backing partners as well as to help better fulfill GlobalFest's mandate of promoting cultural diversity.

Over the years several countries have participated in the pyro-musical aspect of GlobalFest: Canada, [[United States|USA]], [[Mexico]], [[India]], [[South Africa]], [[Germany]], [[Portugal]], Hong Kong, China, Spain, Italy and [[Japan]].

New artistic requirements included a compulsory piece of music that must be incorporated by each competitor and a 25% minimum of each competitor's music that must be native to the representing country. This was done to challenge the designers, provide a better pyro-musical experience to the audience, and better meet the mandate of GlobalFest as a Multi-Cultural Festival.  From 2012-2017, the compulsory piece was composed by local, Calgarian composer Donovan Seidle.

==OneWorld Festival==
In the early years, GlobalFest featured cultural pavilions scattered throughout Calgary, usually in various community halls. The pavilions would often include ethnic food, displays and entertainment. Cultural Pavilions included themes from [[Africa]], [[Latin America|Hispanic America]], [[Middle East]], [[Caribbean]], [[Francophone]], [[India]], [[Italy]], [[Mexico]], [[Scotland]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Vietnam]].  The OneWorld festival was originally co-organized with the International Avenue Arts and Culture Centre.

In 2007, the pavilions were grouped together for the first time at Penbrooke Meadows Community Association and was visited by over 10,000 GlobalFest patrons.

In 2008, a previously protected area of Elliston Park was opened up to the organizers and the move was made to transfer the cultural pavilions to Elliston Park and re-launch the OneWorld Village. The cultural organizations are also provided the opportunity to present their nations' foods in separate food kiosks, located adjacent to the OneWorld Village.

GlobalFest patrons can now enjoy the OneWorld Festival in conjunction with the International Fireworks Festival each evening at the same location in Elliston Park. Cultural stages will feature music, dance and other artists presented by the cultural pavilion organizers within the OneWorld Village. The Calgary Foundation Centennial stage will also be presenting various artists to those patrons on the south side of Elliston Park.  A third stage has been added to the site located in the OneWorld Cafe and International Bar.  The Cafe stage will provide entertainment nightly prior to the fireworks as well as for an hour following the fireworks presentation.

==History==
The idea for the festival started in 1994, when the newly established Calgary Fireworks Festival Society started looking for a safe firework launch site.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt; It took until 2001 to discover Elliston Park and its lake. At the same time, the International Avenue Arts and Culture Centre was making plans for a [[multicultural]] festival in Forest Lawn. The two non-profit societies presented plans for a joint festival at Calgary's International Avenue Business Revitalisation Zone (a city department), and the festival began in 2003, with an audience of almost 100,000, including city residents and tourists.

The site chosen for the fireworks display, Elliston Lake, is the second largest lake in Calgary (after [[Glenmore Reservoir]]), and was created close to a landfill site in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ffwdweekly.com/issues/2003/0807/city.htm FFWD article] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041128142745/http://www.ffwdweekly.com/Issues/2003/0807/city.htm |date=2004-11-28 }} - GlobalFest may prove to be a boon for east Calgary’s Elliston Park&lt;/ref&gt; The land has been owned by the city of Calgary since 1960 The area was used for agriculture for ten years, and Elliston Park opened in 1994. Over the years the park has been expanded by reclaiming land from the nearby landfill, bringing the total area to over 410 hectares, making it the city's second largest park (after Nose Hill).

The Great Slump occurred in England between approximately 1440 and 1480.&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, p.40.&lt;/ref&gt; The economic slowdown began in the 1430s in the north of the country, spreading south in the 1440s, with the economy not recovering until the 1480s.&lt;ref name=HicksP50&gt;Hicks, p.50.&lt;/ref&gt; The Great Slump took place against a wider trading crisis in Northern Europe, driven by shortages of silver, essential for the money supply, and a breakdown in trade.&lt;ref name=HicksP50/&gt; It was also driven by multiple harvest failures in the 1430s and disease amongst livestock, that drove up the price of food and damaged the wider economy.&lt;ref&gt;Hatcher, p.246.&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact of the Great Slump was far reaching across England. Certain groups were particularly badly affected: cloth exports fell by 35 percent in just four years at the end of the 1440s, for example, collapsing by up to 90 percent in some parts of the South-West.&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, p.51.&lt;/ref&gt; Prices of remaining trade goods fell dramatically as well.&lt;ref&gt;Hatcher, p.243.&lt;/ref&gt; Popular rebellions ensued in 1450 under [[Jack Cade]], and the events contributed to the outbreak of the [[Wars of the Roses]] in the 1460s.&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, pp.52–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2409">In the assembly of [[integrated circuit]] packages to [[printed circuit board]]s, a '''head-in-pillow defect''' ('''HIP''' or '''HNP''') is a failure of the [[soldering]] process. For example, in the case of a [[ball grid array]] (BGA) package, the pre-deposited [[solder ball]] on the package and the solder paste applied to the circuit board may both melt, but the melted solder does not join.  A cross-section through the failed joint shows a distinct boundary between the solder ball on the part and the solder paste on the circuit board, rather like a section through a head resting on a pillow.&lt;ref name="evertiq"/&gt;

The defect can be caused by surface oxidation or poor wetting of the solder, or by distortion of the integrated circuit package or circuit board by the heat of the soldering process.  This is particularly a concern when using [[lead-free solder]], which requires higher processing temperature.

Since the warping of the circuit board or integrated circuit may disappear when the board cools, an [[intermittent fault]] may be created.  Diagnosis of head-in-pillow defects may require use of X-rays or EOTPR ([[Electro-optical terahertz pulse reflectometry]]), since the solder joints are hidden between the integrated circuit package and the printed circuit board.

The '''history of [[structural engineering]]''' dates back to at least 2700 BC when the [[step pyramid]] for [[Pharaoh]] [[Djoser]] was built by [[Imhotep]], the first engineer in history known by name. [[Pyramid]]s were the most common major structures built by ancient civilizations because it is a structural form which is inherently stable and can be almost infinitely scaled (as opposed to most other structural forms, which cannot be linearly increased in size in proportion to increased loads).&lt;ref name=Saouma&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ceae.colorado.edu/~saouma/Lecture-Notes/se.pdf|format=PDF|title=Lecture Notes in Structural Engineering|author=Victor E.

Another notable engineering feat from antiquity still in use today is the qanat water management system. 
[[Qanat]] technology developed in the time of the [[Medes]], the predecessors of the [[Persian Empire]] (modern-day [[Iran]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Ahmad Y Hassan]], [http://www.history-science-technology.com/Articles/articles%2071.htm Transfer Of Islamic Technology To The West, Part Ii: Transmission Of Islamic Engineering] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218171021/http://www.history-science-technology.com/Articles/articles%2071.htm |date=2008-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Qanat, Kariz and Khattara: Traditional Water Systems in the Middle East -

}}&lt;/ref&gt; that also spread to other cultures having had contact with the Persian.

Throughout ancient and medieval history most architectural design and construction was carried out by [[artisan]]s, such as stone [[masonry|mason]]s and [[carpenter]]s, rising to the role of [[Master Builder (occupation)|master builder]]. No theory of structures existed and understanding of how structures stood up was extremely limited, and based almost entirely on empirical evidence of 'what had worked before'. Knowledge was retained by [[guilds]] and seldom supplanted by advances. Structures were repetitive, and increases in scale were incremental.&lt;ref name="Saouma"/&gt;

No record exists of the first calculations of the strength of structural members or the behaviour of structural material, but the profession of structural engineer only really took shape with the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the re-invention of [[concrete]] (see [[Concrete#History|History of concrete]]). The [[physical sciences]] underlying structural engineering began to be understood in the [[Renaissance]] and have been developing ever since.

==Early structural engineering developments==
[[File:Archimedes lever (Small).jpg|thumb|250px|Archimedes is said to have remarked about the lever: "Give me a place to stand on, and I will move the Earth."]]

The recorded history of structural engineering starts with the [[ancient Egypt]]ians. In the 27th century BC, [[Imhotep]] was the first structural engineer known by name and constructed the first known [[step pyramid]] in Egypt. In the 26th century BC, the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] was constructed in [[Egypt]]. It remained the largest man-made structure for millennia and was considered an unsurpassed feat in [[architecture]] until the 19th century AD.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The understanding of the physical laws that underpin structural engineering in the [[Western world]] dates back to the 3rd century BC, when [[Archimedes]] published his work ''On the Equilibrium of Planes'' in two volumes, in which he sets out the ''Law of the Lever'', stating:

{{quote|Equal weights at equal distances are in equilibrium, and equal weights at unequal distances are not in equilibrium but incline towards the weight which is at the greater distance.}}

Archimedes used the principles derived to calculate the areas and [[center of mass|centers of gravity]] of various geometric figures including [[triangles]], [[paraboloid]]s, and [[sphere|hemispheres]].&lt;ref name="works"&gt;{{cite web |last=Heath,T.L. | url = https://archive.org/details/worksofarchimede029517mbp | title = ''The Works of Archimedes'' (1897).  The unabridged work in PDF form (19&amp;nbsp;MB)| publisher = [[Archive.org]] | accessdate = 2007-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Archimedes's work on this and his work on calculus and geometry, together with [[Euclidean geometry]], underpin much of the mathematics and understanding of structures in modern structural engineering.

[[File:Pont du Gard BLS.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Pont du Gard]], France, a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] era aqueduct circa 19 BC.]]

The [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] made great bounds in structural engineering, pioneering large structures in [[masonry]] and [[concrete]], many of which are still standing today. They include [[Roman aqueduct|aqueduct]]s, [[thermae]], [[columns]], [[lighthouses]], defensive walls and [[harbours]]. Their methods are recorded by [[Vitruvius]] in his [[De Architectura]] written in 25 BC, a manual of civil and structural engineering with extensive sections on materials and [[machines]] used in construction. One reason for their success is their accurate [[surveying]] techniques based on the [[dioptra]], [[groma surveying|groma]] and [[chorobates]].

Centuries later, in the 15th and 16th centuries and despite lacking beam theory and [[calculus]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]] produced many engineering designs based on scientific observations and rigour, including a design for a bridge to span the [[Golden Horn]]. Though dismissed at the time, the design has since been judged to be both feasible and structurally valid&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mos.org/leonardo/inventor.html|title=Renaissance Man|accessdate=2007-12-05|publisher=Museum of Science, Boston|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970606074441/http://www.mos.org/leonardo/inventor.html|archivedate=1997-06-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Galileo Galilei by Ottavio Leoni Marucelliana (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Galileo Galilei. Portrait in crayon by Leoni]]

The foundations of modern structural engineering were laid in the 17th century by [[Galileo Galilei]], [[Robert Hooke]] and [[Isaac Newton]] with the publication of three great scientific works. In 1638 [[Galileo]] published ''[[Two New Sciences|Dialogues Relating to Two New Sciences]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Galileo, G. (Crew, H &amp; de Salvio, A. (1954))&lt;/ref&gt; outlining the sciences of the strength of materials and the motion of objects (essentially defining [[gravity]] as a [[force]] giving rise to a constant [[acceleration]]). It was the first establishment of a scientific approach to structural engineering, including the first attempts to develop a theory for beams. This is also regarded as the beginning of structural analysis, the mathematical representation and design of building structures.

This was followed in 1676 by [[Robert Hooke|Robert Hooke's]] first statement of [[Hooke's Law]], providing a scientific understanding of elasticity of materials and their behaviour under load.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, Allan. (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Eleven years later, in 1687, [[Sir Isaac Newton]] published ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', setting out his [[Newton's laws of motion|Laws of Motion]], providing for the first time an understanding of the fundamental laws governing structures.&lt;ref&gt;Newton, Isaac;Leseur, Thomas; Jacquier, François. (1822)&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in the 17th century, [[Sir Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz]] both independently developed the [[Fundamental theorem of calculus]], providing one of the most important mathematical tools in engineering.&lt;ref&gt;Stillwel, J. (2002). p.159&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Leonhard Euler 2.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Leonhard Euler]] portrait by Johann Georg Brucker]]

Further advances in the mathematics needed to allow structural engineers to apply the understanding of structures gained through the work of Galileo, Hooke and Newton during the 17th century came in the 18th century when [[Leonhard Euler]] pioneered much of the mathematics and many of the methods which allow structural engineers to model and analyse structures. Specifically, he developed the [[Euler-Bernoulli beam equation]] with [[Daniel Bernoulli]] (1700–1782) circa 1750 - the fundamental theory underlying most structural engineering design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Science of Structural Engineering|author=Heyman, Jacques|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Au34lwRovHIC&amp;dq=Leonhard+Euler+Daniel+Bernoulli+Beam+equation|year=1999|page=69|publisher=Imperial College Press|isbn=1-86094-189-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Euler&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=75vJL_Y-PvsC&amp;dq=leonhard+euler+buckling+formula|title=Leonhard Euler: Life, Work and Legacy|author1=Bradley, Robert E. |author2=Sandifer, Charles Edward |year=2007|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=0-444-52728-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daniel Bernoulli]], with [[Jean Bernoulli|Johann (Jean) Bernoulli]] (1667–1748), is also credited with formulating the theory of [[virtual work]], providing a tool using equilibrium of forces and compatibility of geometry to solve structural problems. In 1717 Jean Bernoulli wrote to [[Pierre Varignon]] explaining the principle of virtual work, while in 1726 Daniel Bernoulli wrote of the "composition of forces".&lt;ref&gt;Dugas, René (1988). p.231&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1757 [[Leonhard Euler]] went on to derive the [[buckling|Euler buckling]] formula, greatly advancing the ability of engineers to design compression elements.&lt;ref name="Euler"/&gt;

Throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries, materials science and structural analysis underwent development at a tremendous pace.

Though elasticity was understood in theory well before the 19th century, it was not until 1821 that [[Claude-Louis Navier]] formulated the general theory of elasticity in a mathematically usable form. In his ''leçons'' of 1826 he explored a great range of different structural theory, and was the first to highlight that the role of a structural engineer is not to understand the final, failed state of a structure, but to prevent that failure in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Science of Structural Engineering|author=Heyman, Jacques|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Au34lwRovHIC&amp;dq=Leonhard+Euler+Daniel+Bernoulli+Beam+equation|year=1999|page=62|publisher=Imperial College Press|isbn=1-86094-189-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1826 he also established the [[elastic modulus]] as a property of materials independent of the [[second moment of area]], allowing engineers for the first time to both understand structural behaviour and structural materials.&lt;ref&gt;Hosford, W.F. (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of the 19th century, in 1873, [[Carlo Alberto Castigliano]] presented his dissertation "Intorno ai sistemi elastici", which contains his theorem for computing displacement as partial derivative of the strain energy.&lt;ref&gt;Castigliano, C.A. (Andrews, E.S.) (1966)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1824, [[Portland cement]] was patented by the engineer [[Joseph Aspdin]] as ''"a superior cement resembling Portland Stone"'', British Patent no. 5022. Although different forms of cement already existed (Pozzolanic cement was used by the Romans as early as 100 B.C. and even earlier by the ancient Greek and Chinese civilizations) and were in common usage in Europe from the 1750s, the discovery made by Aspdin used commonly available, cheap materials, making concrete construction an economical possibility.&lt;ref&gt;Prentice, J.E. (1990) p.171&lt;/ref&gt;

Developments in concrete continued with the construction in 1848 of a rowing boat built of [[ferrocement]] - the forerunner of modern [[reinforced concrete]] - by [[Joseph-Louis Lambot]]. He patented his system of mesh reinforcement and concrete in 1855, one year after W.B. Wilkinson also patented a similar system.&lt;ref&gt;Nedwell,P.J.; Swamy,R.N.(ed). (1994) p.27&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed in 1867 when a reinforced concrete planting tub was patented by [[Joseph Monier]] in Paris, using steel mesh reinforcement similar to that used by Lambot and Wilkinson. Monier took the idea forward, filing several patents for tubs, slabs and beams, leading eventually to the Monier system of reinforced structures, the first use of steel reinforcement bars located in areas of tension in the structure.&lt;ref&gt;Kirby, R.S. (1990) p.476&lt;/ref&gt;

Steel construction was first made possible in the 1850s when [[Henry Bessemer]] developed the [[Bessemer process]] to produce [[steel]]. He gained patents for the process in 1855 and 1856 and successfully completed the conversion of cast iron into cast steel in 1858.&lt;ref&gt;Swank, J.M. (1965) p.395&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually [[mild steel]] would replace both [[wrought iron]] and [[cast iron]] as the preferred metal for construction.

During the late 19th century, great advancements were made in the use of cast iron, gradually replacing wrought iron as a material of choice. [[Ditherington Flax Mill]] in [[Shrewsbury]], designed by [[Charles Bage]], was the first building in the world with an interior iron frame. It was built in 1797. In 1792 [[William Strutt (inventor)|William Strutt]] had attempted to build a fireproof mill at Belper in [[Derby]] (Belper West Mill), using cast iron columns and timber beams within the depths of brick arches that formed the floors. The exposed beam soffits were protected against fire by plaster. This mill at Belper was the world's first attempt to construct fireproof buildings, and is the first example of [[fire engineering]]. This was later improved upon with the construction of [[Belper North Mill]], a collaboration between Strutt and Bage, which by using a full cast iron frame represented the world's first "fire proofed" building.&lt;ref&gt;Blank, A.; McEvoy, M.; Plank, R. (1993) p.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Labrum, E.A. (1994) p.23&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Forth Railway Bridge|Forth Bridge]] was built by [[Benjamin Baker (engineer)|Benjamin Baker]], [[Sir John Fowler, 1st Baronet|Sir John Fowler]] and [[William Arrol]] in 1889, using [[steel]], after the original design for the bridge by [[Thomas Bouch]] was rejected following the collapse of his [[Tay Rail Bridge]]. The Forth Bridge was one of the first major uses of steel, and a landmark in bridge design. Also in 1889, the wrought-iron [[Eiffel Tower]] was built by Gustave Eiffel and Maurice Koechlin, demonstrating the potential of construction using iron, despite the fact that steel construction was already being used elsewhere.

During the late 19th century, Russian structural engineer [[Vladimir Shukhov]] developed analysis methods for [[tensile structure]]s, [[thin-shell structure]]s, [[gridshell|lattice shell structure]]s and new structural geometries such as [[hyperboloid structure]]s. [[Pipeline transport]] was pioneered by [[Vladimir Shukhov]] and the [[Branobel]] company in the late 19th century.

Again taking reinforced concrete design forwards, from 1892 onwards [[François Hennebique]]'s firm used his patented reinforced concrete system to build thousands of structures throughout Europe. [[Thaddeus Hyatt]] in the US and Wayss &amp; Freitag in Germany also patented systems. The firm ''AG für Monierbauten'' constructed 200 reinforced concrete bridges in Germany between 1890 and 1897 &lt;ref&gt;Leonhardt. p.41&lt;/ref&gt; The great pioneering uses of reinforced concrete however came during the first third of the 20th century, with [[Robert Maillart]] and others furthering of the understanding of its behaviour. Maillart noticed that many concrete bridge structures were significantly cracked, and as a result left the cracked areas out of his next bridge design - correctly believing that if the concrete was cracked, it was not contributing to the strength. This resulted in the revolutionary [[Salginatobel Bridge]] design. Wilhelm Ritter formulated the truss theory for the shear design of reinforced concrete beams in 1899, and Emil Mörsch improved this in 1902. He went on to demonstrate that treating concrete in compression as a linear-elastic material was a conservative approximation of its behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Mörsch, E. p.83&lt;/ref&gt; Concrete design and analysis has been progressing ever since, with the development of analysis methods such as yield line theory, based on plastic analysis of concrete (as opposed to linear-elastic), and many different variations on the model for stress distributions in concrete in compression&lt;ref&gt;Hognestad, E.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoogenboom P.C.J., "Discrete Elements and Nonlinearity in Design of Structural Concrete Walls", Section 1.3 Historical Overview of Structural Concrete Modelling, August 1998, {{ISBN|90-901184-3-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prestressed concrete]], pioneered by [[Eugène Freyssinet]] with a patent in 1928, gave a novel approach in overcoming the weakness of concrete structures in tension. Freyssinet constructed an experimental prestressed arch in 1908 and later used the technology in a limited form in the [[Plougastel Bridge]] in France in 1930. He went on to build six prestressed concrete bridges across the [[Marne River]], firmly establishing the technology.&lt;ref&gt;Hewson, N.R. (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

Structural engineering theory was again advanced in 1930 when Professor [[Hardy Cross]] developed his [[Moment distribution method]], allowing the real stresses of many complex structures to be approximated quickly and accurately.&lt;ref name=Heyman1&gt;Heyman, J. (1998) p.101&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid 20th century [[John Fleetwood Baker]] went on to develop the plasticity theory of structures, providing a powerful tool for the safe design of steel structures. The possibility of creating structures with complex geometries, beyond analysis by hand calculation methods, first arose in 1941 when [[Alexander Hrennikoff]] submitted his D.Sc thesis at [[MIT]] on the topic of discretization of plane elasticity problems using a lattice framework. This was the forerunner to the development of [[finite element analysis]]. In 1942, [[Richard Courant]] developed a mathematical basis for finite element analysis. This led in 1956 to the publication by J. Turner, R. W. Clough, H. C. Martin, and L. J. Topp's of a paper on the "Stiffness and Deflection of Complex Structures". This paper introduced the name "finite-element method" and is widely recognised as the first comprehensive treatment of the method as it is known today.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, J.; Clough, R.W.; Martin, H.C.; Topp, L.J. (1956) p.803-23, 854&lt;/ref&gt;

High-rise construction, though possible from the late 19th century onwards, was greatly advanced during the second half of the 20th century. [[Fazlur Khan]] designed structural systems that remain fundamental to many modern [[skyscraper|high rise construction]]s and which he employed in his structural designs for the [[John Hancock Center]] in 1969 and [[Sears Tower]] in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Mir, A. (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Khan's central innovation in [[skyscraper design and construction]] was the idea of the [[Tube (structure)|"tube" and "bundled tube"]] structural systems for tall buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chris H. Luebkeman|url=http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~struct/resources/pencil/systems/sys13.htm|title=Tube-in-Tube|year=1996 |accessdate=2008-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chris H.

Horizontal loads, for example wind, are supported by the structure as a whole. About half the exterior surface is available for windows. Framed tubes allow fewer interior columns, and so create more usable floor space. Where larger openings like garage doors are required, the tube frame must be interrupted, with transfer girders used to maintain structural integrity. The first building to apply the tube-frame construction was in the [[DeWitt-Chestnut Apartment Building]] which Khan designed in [[Chicago]]. This laid the foundations for the tube structures used in most later skyscraper constructions, including the [[construction of the World Trade Center]].

Another innovation that Fazlur Khan developed was the concept of X-bracing, which reduced the lateral load on the building by transferring the load into the exterior columns. This allowed for a reduced need for interior columns thus creating more floor space, and can be seen in the John Hancock Center. The first [[sky lobby]] was also designed by Khan for the John Hancock Center in 1969. Later buildings with sky lobbies include the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]], [[Petronas Twin Towers]] and [[Taipei 101]].

In 1987 [[Jörg Schlaich]] and Kurt Schafer published the culmination of almost ten years of work on the strut and tie method for concrete analysis - a tool to design structures with discontinuities such as corners and joints, providing another powerful tool for the analysis of complex concrete geometries.&lt;ref&gt;Schlaich, J., K. Schäfer, M. Jennewein&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 20th and early 21st centuries the development of powerful [[computers]] has allowed [[finite element analysis]] to become a significant tool for structural analysis and design. The development of finite element programs has led to the ability to accurately predict the stresses in complex structures, and allowed great advances in structural engineering design and architecture. In the 1960s and 70s computational analysis was used in a significant way for the first time on the design of the [[Sydney Opera House]] roof. Many modern structures could not be understood and designed without the use of computational analysis.&lt;ref&gt;MacNeal, R.H. (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

Developments in the understanding of materials and structural behaviour in the latter part of the 20th century have been significant, with detailed understanding being developed of topics such as [[fracture mechanics]], [[earthquake engineering]], [[composite materials]], temperature effects on materials, dynamics and [[vibration control]], [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]], [[Creep (deformation)|creep]] and others. The depth and breadth of knowledge now available in [[structural engineering]], and the increasing range of different structures and the increasing complexity of those structures has led to increasing specialisation of structural engineers.

'''India Film Project''' is an annual content creation festival held in Mumbai, India. The festival features a flagship 50 Hour filmmaking challenge, where participants are given 50 hours to make a film after which a panel of judges select award winners. The competition has run each September since 2011 and is deemed as largest creative collaborative activity. Competitors form teams and are given a common theme to which they then write a script and shoot the films. They have a free choice of locations, equipment and actors. The teams are also responsible for post-production including editing and audio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news-interviews/Shoot-a-film-within-48-hours-project-goes-global/articleshow/21450585.cms|title=Shoot a film within 48 hours project goes global|last=Sahu|first=Deepika|date=29 July 2013|work=[[The Times of India]]|publisher=Bennett, Coleman &amp; Co.

== History ==
India Film Project (IFP) was started by Ritam Bhatnagar in 2011 as the Ahmedabad Film Project, a competition for local filmmakers. In 2013 it was renamed the India Film Project, admitting entrants from other countries from 2014. The sixth edition held in September 2016 received entries from over 260 cities and 20 countries.

===Season 1===
The first Ahmedabad Film Project in 2011 received 86 entries from 18 cities. Filmmaker [[Sanjay Gadhvi]] was the jury member.

'''''Jeffrey Bernard Is Unwell''''' is a play by [[Keith Waterhouse]] about real-life journalist [[Jeffrey Bernard]]. Bernard was still alive at the time the play was first performed in the [[West End theatre|West End]] in 1989.

Bernard wrote the "Low Life" column in ''[[The Spectator]]''. The play's title refers to the magazine's habit of printing a one-line apology on a blank page when he was too drunk or hung-over to produce the required copy and a substitute article could not be found before the deadline for publication. Its premise is that Bernard has found himself locked in overnight at his favourite public house, the [[Coach and Horses, Soho]], and uses the occasion to share anecdotes from his life with the audience.  A highlight of the play is a trick involving a glass of water, a matchbox, and an egg which must remain unbroken at the end of the trick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=London Theatre |url=http://www.londontheatre.co.uk/peterbrown/reviews/jeffreybernardisunwell06.htm |accessdate=2010-04-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126162034/http://londontheatre.co.uk/peterbrown/reviews/jeffreybernardisunwell06.htm |archivedate=2010-11-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This trick is more fully described in an obituary of [[Keith Waterhouse]] in ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Keith Waterhouse obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/sep/04/keith-waterhouse-obituary|accessdate=2012-11-07 | location=London|work=The Guardian|first=Mike|last=Molloy|date=2009-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often remembered as a one-man show, but in fact packed with characters performed by a versatile supporting cast of four, ''Jeffrey Bernard Is Unwell'' was a highly successful vehicle for its original star [[Peter O'Toole]]. The show opened in Brighton in September 1989, moved to Bath and made its triumphant London debut at the [[Apollo Theatre]] in Shaftesbury Avenue in October. O'Toole also appeared in a later revival at the [[Old Vic]]. The Old Vic run was totally sold out, and on 23 August 1999 the London ''[[Evening Standard]]'' published a 'Bluffer's Guide' to enable readers to pretend they had seen it: "thereby allowing dinner party conversations and watercooler debates to run their course unhindered by ignorance."

A filmed version of the stage play was shot at the Apollo Theatre with a live audience and was released in both  full and abridged versions.

O'Toole was followed in the part by [[Tom Conti]] who starred in a revival of the play until September 2006 at the [[Garrick Theatre]] in London. The part has also been played by [[James Bolam]], [[Dennis Waterman]], [[Robert Powell]], and most recently [[Simon Hill]] in the Frayed Knot Production of the play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Stage Review|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/review.php/31700/jeffrey-bernard-is-unwell.|accessdate=2011-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kadayawan Festival''' is an annual [[festival]] in the city of [[Davao City|Davao]] in the [[Philippines]]. Its name derives from the friendly greeting "Madayaw", from the [[Davawenyo language|Dabawenyo word]] "dayaw", meaning good, valuable, superior or beautiful. The festival is a celebration of life, a thanksgiving for the gifts of nature, the wealth of culture, the bounties of harvest and serenity of living. It is held every third week of August&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philippinecountry.com/philippine_festivals/kadayawan_sa_dabaw.html|title=Kadayawan sa Dabaw festival}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==
This ritual serves as their thanksgiving to the gods particularly to the "Manama" (the Supreme Being) and Bulan (a moon deity) that the first gathering was on a night of a full moon,
It was said that, long time ago, Ancient Visayans and Davao's ethnic tribes residing at the foot of Mount Apo would converge during a bountiful harvest and had to celebrate the full moon because they believed "the diwata came to earth at that time" so did the other islanders and tribesmen. The full moon was greeted with a variety of names- 'paghipono', 'takdul', 'ugsar'- but most significantly as "dayaw" [at present it is kadayaw in some Bisayan Islands], perfect or praiseworthy, fit recognition of its spectacular shape and sunset-to-sunrise brilliance. It was so beautiful that the pre-colonial people praised and believed it was the reason for their bountiful harvest

Various farming implements, fruits, flowers, vegetables, rice and corn grains were displayed on mats as villagers give their respect and thanks for the year's abundance. Singing, dancing and offerings to their divine protectors are the highlights of this ritual.

Although times have changed, this practice of thanksgiving or "pahinungod" is still very much practiced by modern-day Davaoeños. This tradition flourished and evolved into an annual festival of thanksgiving.

In the 1970s, Mayor Elias B. Lopez, a Bagobo, initiated tribal festivals featuring the [[Lumad]] and the Muslim tribes of Davao City where they showcase their dances and rituals of thanksgiving.

Later in 1986, a program called "Unlad Proyekto Davao" was initiated by the government which was aimed to unite the Dabawenyos after the turbulent Martial Law era. At that time, the festival was called "Apo Duwaling," a name created from the famous icons of Davao:  Mt. Apo, the country's highest peak; Durian, the king of fruits; and Waling-waling, the queen of orchids.

"Apo Duwaling" was meant to showcase the city as a peaceful destination to visit and to do business after 1986 EDSA Revolution.

Finally in 1988, City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte renamed the festival as "Kadayawan sa Dabaw" to celebrate the bountiful harvest of Davao's flowers, fruits and other produce as well as the wealth of the city's cultures. To this day, the festival continues to honor the city's richness and diverse artistic, cultural and historical heritage in a grand celebration of thanksgiving for all of Davao City's blessings.

==Today==
Cultural and historical heritage, its past personified by the ancestral [[Lumad]] people, its people as they celebrate on the streets, and its floral industry as its representatives parade in full regalia in thanksgiving for the blessings granted on the city. A celebration that interfaces the three aspects: tribal; industrial and; arts and entertainment. The festivities are highlighted with floral floats, street-dancing competitions and exhibits that showcases the island's tourism products and services.

Today, the recognized original tribes of Davao are here for political reasons. They are recognized because of their present-day influence since they have organized themselves well. They are given deputy mayors to be their representatives to the political powers of Davao City. The present tribes of Davao is not based on historical accounts of the original inhabitants at all. They have removed the Mansakas and Mandayas from the list and replaced them with the Muslim tribes like Maranao, Tausug, and Maguindanao. Their reason is Mansaka is from Davao del norte and Mandaya is from Davao Oriental. What they didn't notice is the places they said have "''Davao''" in their names while the Maguindanaos, Tausugs and Maranaos are obviously not from a place called Davao. What is more ironic is that Mandaya and Mansaka have the word "''madayaw''" in their dialects from which the "Kadayawan Festival" is derived.

If the tribes are recognized because of their present numbers in a city then the Muslim tribes (especially the Maranaos) must have been also recognized as original tribes by other cities and municipalities since they are found in numbers in every city and municipality in the Philippines.

===Davao River Festival===
This year bears witness to the revival of the Davao River Festival. The tribes will have their own floats and will be introduced in
the fluvial parade along DaWOW AMAZING (Davao) River on August 16. The parade of these colorful floats is not to be missed because the last time there was such an event was
in 2008.

===Sayaw Mindanaw===
Davao City takes pride of its tribal and ethnic roots. Each of the 11 tribes has its own set of dances, rituals, and customs. These are showcased in the dance competition, although the participants are not necessarily a representative of a tribe.

===Lumadnong Bantawan===
The indigenous people of Davao City offer performances that depict the life, history, culture, and numerous talents. Each of the
tribes is given the chance to offer the performance of a lifetime in different timeslots and location in a series of shows.

===Tunog Mindanaw===
This is a songwriting competition open to the public but focuses on the unique sounds and instrumentations of the region.
Songwriters create Mindanaoan-inspired music that gives you a glimpse of the rich culture of Davao City and its neighbors.

===Hiyas sa Kadayawan===
The tribes pick their most talented and beautiful women to represent them, a regnant search for that distinctive indigenous young lady who is knowledgeable of her native culture and wisdom through a pageantry of Mindanaoan myths and legends. These gorgeous women will also join the parade and shower smiles.

===Indak-Indak sa Kadalanan===
This street parade is a must-see in the festival, with the city’s major thoroughfares closed off to traffic for the entire event. This colorful parade features graceful dancers
decked in splendid, colorful costumes and dancing to the beat of ethnic-inspired music. This happens on August 17.
The streets come alive with millions of stunning colors from the dancers and their glorious costumes and props. The
competition showcases local talents whose dancing prowess can make you dance to the beat of their music. It is a day of cheers
and smiles – prepare to be amazed.

===Pamulak sa Kadalanan===
On August 18, Pamulak sa Kadalanan brings parades to a whole new level, introducing a
colorful parade of majestic floral floats that offer a wide range of stunning designs and intricate craftsmanship. The event was
designed to showcase the beautiful flowers and abundant vegetation grown across the
city.

T he festival is celebrated in the month of August with floats of fresh flowers and fruits, and indak-indak sa kadalanan or street dancing in colorful costumes. A variety of tribes parade the streets with their tribal costumes and jewelry. The city of Davao comes alive every year in August when it holds it yearly harvest festival. The streets are adorned with local fruit &amp; vegetables while people hold street dances with abandon for four days. The harbour is the venue for native &amp; power boat races. Everybody fights for seats to watch the Horse Fighting wherein stallions fight each other over the rights to mate with a mare. The crowd is sometimes tracked by the horses if they get too close. The last day the street is full of costumed dancers dancing to the local beat &amp; decorated floats with glamorous Mindanao girls as eye candy. It's a time of fun &amp; abandon. The festivity is not complete without the Bya'Neng ng Kadayawan or the Miss Kadayawan beauty contest. There is also the horsefight, a tribal animal show similar to the bullfight in Spain.

[[Image:Lion-baiting3.jpg|thumb|300px|Lion-bait at [[Warwick]] between Wallace and dogs, Tinker and Ball, circa 1827.]]
'''Lion-baiting''' is a [[blood sport]] involving the [[dog-baiting]] of [[lion]]s.

==Antiquity==
[[Image:Lion-baiting1.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Alexander the Great]]]]
[[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]] has examples where groups of dogs defeats even the 'King of Beasts', the lion.  [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] legend reflects [[Achilles]] [[shield]] with the depiction of a fight of his dog against two lions. A second is a [[Persian Empire|Persian]] King [[Kambyses]] possessed a dog that started a fight with two full-grown lions. A third, is reported by a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] historian, [[Claudius Aelianus]], in which he states [[India]]ns showed [[Alexander the Great]] powerful dogs bred for lion-baiting. Certainly, [[Ancient history|ancient historians]] would embellish and exaggerate their stories, but they do capture the spirit of dog versus lion.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The [[Roman Empire]] used to import [[Barbary lion]]s from [[North Africa]] for [[gladiatorial]] [[Ludi|games]].&lt;ref name="NowellJackson1996"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Nowell |first=K. |last2=Jackson |first2=P. |title=Wild Cats: Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan |url=http://carnivoractionplans1.free.fr/wildcats.pdf |year=1996 |publisher=IUCN/SSC Cat Specialist Group |location=Gland, Switzerland |isbn=2-8317-0045-0 |pages=17–21, 37–41 |chapter=''Panthera leo''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Europe==

===1610===
In 1610, during the reign of [[James I of England]] the practice of lion-baiting was first recorded.  The spectacle was staged for the amusement of the court.  The King requested [[Edward Alleyn]], Master of the [[Beargarden]], to acquire the three largest and most courageous dogs.  The event was as follows:

:"One of the dogs, which was the first to be sent in the cage, was soon put out of action by the lion, which seized it by the head and neck and dragged it through the cage.  A second dog was sent in and met with the same fate.  The third, however, which came to its aid, immediately seized the lion by the lower jaw and gripped it securely for a considerable time until, severely injured by the lion's claws, it was forced to loosen its grip.  The lion itself was injured in the fight and did not wish to continue fighting.  With a sudden mighty leap over the dogs, it fled inside its den.  Two of the dogs died shortly after the fight from the injuries they had suffered.  The last, however, survived this splendid fight and was nursed back to health with great care by the King's son, [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales]].  Prince Henry declared: 'He had fought the king of the wild animals and should never again have to fight baser creatures!'  In this way, the dog had gained for itself a safe life at the English Royal court."{{fact|date=July 2018}}

===1790===
In 1790, [[The Times]] reported a lion-baiting in [[Vienna]] as follows:

:"There was a lion fight at the amphitheatre of Vienna, in the summer of 1790, which was almost the last permitted in that capital. The amphitheatre at Vienna embraced an area of from eighty to a hundred feet in diameter. The lower part of the structure comprised the dens of the different animals. Above those dens, and about ten feet from the ground, were the first and principal seats, over which were galleries. In the course of the entertainment, a den was opened, out of which stalked, in free and ample range, a most majestic lion; and, soon after, a fallow deer was let into the circus from another den. The deer instantly fled, and bounded round the circular space, pursued by the lion; but the quick and sudden turnings of the former continually baulked the effort of its pursuer. After this ineffectual chase had continued for several minutes, a door was opened, through which the deer escaped; and presently five or 
[[Image:Lion-baiting2.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Cane Corso]]s]] six of the large and fierce [[Hungarian Mastiff]]s were sent in. The lion, at the moment of their entrance, was leisurely returning to his den, the door of which stood open. The dogs, which entered behind him, flew towards him in a body, with the utmost fury, making the amphitheatre ring with their barking. When they reached the lion, the noble animal stopped, and deliberately turned towards them. The dogs instantly retreated a few steps, increasing their vociferations, and the lion slowly resumed his progress towards his den. The dogs again approached; the lion turned his head; his adversaries halted; and this continued until, on his nearing his den, the dogs separated, and approached him on different sides. The lion then turned quickly round, like one whose dignified patience could brook the harassment of insolence no longer. The dogs fled far, as if instinctively sensible of the power of wrath they had at length provoked. One unfortunate dog, however, which had approached too near to effect his escape, was suddenly seized by the paw of the lion; and the piercing yells which he sent forth quickly caused his comrades to recede to the door of entrance at the opposite site of the area, where they stood in a row, barking and yelling in concert with their miserable associate. After arresting the struggling and yelling prisoner for a short time, the lion couched upon him with his forepaws and mouth. The struggles of the sufferer grew feebler and feebler, until at length he became perfectly motionless. We all concluded him to be dead. In this composed posture of executive justice, the lion remained for at least ten minutes, when he majestically rose, and with a slow step entered his den, and disappeared. The apparent corpse continued to lie motionless for a few minutes; presently the dog, to his amazement, and that of the whole amphitheatre, found himself alive, and rose with his nose pointed to the ground, his tail between his hind legs pressing his belly, and, as soon as he was certified of his existence, he made off for the door in a long trot, through which he escaped with his more fortunate companions."{{fact|date=July 2018}}

===1791===
J. March's, Zoological Anecdotes, circa 1845, has the story of a second lion-bait, which occurred in Vienna in the year 1791 as follows:

:"Of late years the truth of the accounts which have been so long current, respecting the generous disposition of the lion, have been called in question. Several travellers, in their accounts of Asia and Africa, describe him as of a more rapacious and sanguinary disposition than had formerly been supposed, although few of them have had the opportunity to make him a particular object of their attention. A circumstance that occurred not long since in Vienna seems, however, to confirm the more ancient accounts. In the year 1791, at which period the custom of baiting wild beasts still existed in that city, a combat was to be exhibited between a lion and a number of large dogs. As soon as the noble animal made his appearance, four large bull-dogs were turned loose upon him, three of which, however, as soon as they came near him, took fright, and ran away. One only had courage to remain, and make the attack. The lion, however, without rising from the ground upon which he was lying, showed him, by a single stroke with his paw, how greatly his superior he was in strength; for the dog was instantly stretched motionless on the ground. The lion drew him towards him, and laid his fore-paws upon him in such a manner that only a small part of his body could be seen. Every one imagined that the dog was dead, and that the lion would soon rise and devour him. But they were mistaken. The dog began to move, and struggled to get loose, which the lion permitted him to do. He seemed merely to have warned him not to meddle with him any more; but when the dog attempted to run away, and had already got half over the enclosure, the lion's indignation seemed to be excited. He sprang from the ground, and in two leaps reached the fugitive, who had just got as far as the paling, and was whining to have it opened for him to escape. The flying animal had called the instinctive propensity of the monarch of the forest into action: the defenceless enemy now excited his pity; for the generous lion stepped a few paces backward, and looked quietly on, while a small door was opened to let the dog out of the enclosure.  This unequivocal trait of generosity moved every spectator. A shout of applause resounded throughout the assembly, who had enjoyed a satisfaction of a description far superior to what they had expected.  It is possible that the African lion, when, under the impulse of hunger, he goes out to seek his prey, may not so often exhibit this [[magnanimity|magnanimous]] disposition; for in that case he is compelled by imperious necessity to satisfy the cravings of nature; but when his appetite is satiated, he never seeks for prey, nor does he ever destroy to gratify a blood-thirsty disposition."

===1825===
[[Image:Lion-baiting ticket.jpg|thumb|175px|right|Ticket to '''NERO''' "Great Lion Fight"]]
In 1825, two more lion fights took place, staged by a promoter named [[George Wombwell]], who travelled around England with his collection of caged wild animals. The fights were arranged in collaboration with dog dealers Ben White and [[Bill George (dog dealer)|Bill George]].{{fact|date=July 2018}}

The cage measured fifteen feet square, ten feet high, with an elevated floor six feet from the ground.  The old iron bars were wide enough apart for a dog to enter or escape.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

The first bait involved the lion named "Nero" and the second bait a lion named "Wallace".{{fact|date=July 2018}}

====Nero====
[[Image:Lion-baiting6.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Nero]]
[[The Morning Herald]] of 26 July 1825, provided the following account:

:"The lion's travelling caravan was drawn close to the fighting cage, so that the door could be opened from one into the other; and the keeper, Wombwell, then going into the travelling caravan, in which another man had already been staying with the lion for some time, the animal followed him into the cage as tamely as a [[Newfoundland (dog)|Newfoundland]] dog.  The whole demeanour of the beast, indeed, was so quiet and generous, that at his first appearance, it became very much doubted whether he would attempt to fight at all.  While the multitude shouted and the dogs were yelling in the ground below, he walked up and down his cage with the most perfect composure, not at all angered, or even excited.

:In the meantime, Wombwell had quit the cage and the dogs were 'made ready'.  These were the fallow-coloured [[Old English Bulldog]], a brown with white legs and a third brown altogether averaging about forty pounds in weight a piece and described in the printed papers, which were distributed by the names Captain, Tiger and Turk.  As the dogs were held for a minute in slips, upon which they ran from the ground to the stage, the lion crouched on his belly to receive them; but, with so perfect an absence of anything like ferocity, showed clearly that the idea of fighting, or doing mischief to any living creature, never had occurred to him.
[[Image:Nettle-dog.jpg|thumb|left|Nettel was in the second group of dogs set on Nero]]
:At the first rush of the dogs, which the lion evidently had not expected and did not at all know how to meet, they all fixed themselves upon him, but caught only by the dewlap and the mane.  With a single effort he shook them off, without attempting to return the attack.  He then flew from side to side of the cage, endeavouring to get away; but in the next moment the assailants were upon him again, and the brown dog, Turk, seized him by the nose, while the two others fastened at the same time on the fleshy part of his lips and under-jaw.  The lion then roared dreadfully, but evidently only from the pain he suffered, not at all from anger.  As the dogs hung to his throat and head, he pawed them off by sheer strength; and in doing this and in rolling upon them, did them considerably mischief; but it amounted to the most curious fact that he never once bit, or attempted to bite, during the whole contest, or seemed to have any desire to retaliate any of the punishment which was inflicted upon him.

:When he was first 'pinned', for instance, the dogs hung to him for more than a minute and were drawn, holding to his nose and lips, several times round the ring.  After a short time, roaring tremendously, he tore them off with his claws, mauling two a good deal in the operation, but still not attempting afterward to act on the offensive.  After about five minutes fighting, the fallow-coloured dog was taken away, lame and apparently much distressed and the remaining two continued the combat alone, the lion still working only with his paws, as though seeking to rid himself of a torture, the nature of which he did not well understand.  In two or three minutes more, the second dog, Tiger, being dreadfully maimed, crawled out of the business; not the brown dog, Turk, which was the lightest of the three, but was of admirable courage and went on fighting by himself.

:A most extraordinary scene ensued; dog, left entirely alone with an animal twenty time its weight, continued the battle with unabated fury and thought bleeding all over from the effect of the lion's claws, seized and pinned him by the nose at least half a dozen times; when, at length, releasing himself with a desperate effort, the lion flung his whole weight upon the dog and held him lying between his fore paws for more than a minute, during which time he could have bitten his head off a hundred times over, but did not make the slightest effort to hurt him.  Poor Turk was then taken away by the dog-keepers, grievously mangled but still alive and seized the lion, for at least the twentieth time, the very same moment that he was released from under him.

:The second round of the contest presented only a repetition of the first.  However, the second set of dogs being heavier than the first and the lion more exhausted, it became a one-way contest.  Nero, bleeding freely from the nose and head, was unable to keep his footing and slipped on the wet boards.  The dogs, all three, seized him; the lion endeavoured to get rid of them in the same way as before, using his pawn and not thinking of fighting, but not with the same success.  He fell and showed symptoms of weakness, upon which the dogs were taken away.  This termination, however, did not please the crowd, who cried out loudly that the dogs were not beaten.

:Some confusion then followed; after which the doges were again put in and again seized the lion, which by this time, as well as bleeding freely from the head appeared to have hurt one of this fore feet.  Nero weakened rapidly, Mr. Wombwell announced that he gave on the part of the lion; and the exhibition was declared to at an end.  The first round lasting eleven minutes with the seconds less than five.  From the beginning of the contest to the end, the lion was merely a sufferer; he never struck a blow in anger."

====Wallace====
[[Image:Lion-baiting7.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Wallace makes short work of the dogs]]
Wombwell, in the same week, submitted another of his lions to be baited and this match proved to be a very different proposition for the dogs.  [[The Times]] gave an account of the contest as follows:

:"Wombwell has, notwithstanding the public indignation which accompanied the exposure of the lion Nero to the six dogs, kept his word with the lovers of cruel sports by a second exhibition. He matched his 'Wallace,' a fine lion, cubbed in Scotland, against six of the best dogs that could be found. Wallace's temper is the very opposite of that of the gentle Nero. It is but seldom that he lets even his feeders approach him, and he soon shows that he cannot reconcile himself to familiarity from any creature not of his own species. Towards eight o'clock the factory-yard was well attended, at 5s. each person, and soon after the battle commenced. The lion was turned from his den to the same stage on which Nero fought. The match was—1st. Three couples of dogs to be slipped at him, two at a time—2d. Twenty minutes or more, as the umpires should think fit, to be allowed between each attack—3d. The dogs to be handed to the cage once only. Tinker, Ball, Billy, Sweep, Turpin, Tiger.

:In the first round, Tinker and Ball were let loose, and both made a gallant attack; the lion having waited for them as if aware of the approach of his foes. He showed himself a forest lion, and fought like one. He clapped his paw upon poor Ball, took Tinker in his teeth, and deliberately walked round the stage with him as a cat would with a mouse. Ball, released from the paw, worked all he could, but Wallace treated his slight punishment by a kick now and then. He at length dropped Tinker, and that poor animal crawled off the stage as well as he could. The lion then seized Ball by the mouth, and played precisely the same game with him as if he had actually been trained to it. Ball would have been almost devoured, but his second got hold of him through the bars, and hauled him away. Turpin, a London, and Sweep, a Liverpool dog, made an excellent attack, but it was three or four minutes before the ingenuity of their seconds could get them on. Wallace [[Squatting position|squatted on his haunches]], and placed himself erect at the slope where the dogs mounted the stage, as if he thought they dared not approach. The dogs, when on, fought gallantly; but both were vanquished in less than a minute after their attack. The London dog bolted as soon as he could extricate himself from the lion's grasp, but Sweep would have been killed on the spot, but he was released. Wedgbury untied Billy and Tiger, casting a most piteous look upon the wounded dogs around him. Both went to work. Wallace seized Billy by the loins, and when shaking him, Tiger having run away, Wedgbury cried out, 'There, you see how you've gammoned me to have the best dog in England killed.' Billy, however, escaped with his life; he was dragged through the railing, after having received a mark in the loins, which (if he recovers at all) will probably render him unfit for any future contest. The victory of course was declared in favour of the lion.  Several well-dressed women viewed the contest from the upper apartment of the factory."

Wallace was the first African lion to be bred in the UK, having been born in Edinburgh in 1812. He was probably named after Scottish fighter [[William Wallace]]. He died in 1838, and his stuffed body placed in the museum in [[Saffron Walden]], Essex. When in 1930 [[Marriott Edgar]] wrote his humorous monologue ''The Lion and Albert'', he called the lion "Wallace".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ravishingbeasts.com/lions/2006/11/3/wallace-the-lion.html|title=taxidermy - Lions &amp; Other Predators - Wallace the Lion|publisher=|accessdate=20 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221000524/http://www.ravishingbeasts.com/lions/2006/11/3/wallace-the-lion.html|archivedate=21 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Marx in Soho''''' is a 1999 [[one-man play]] written by American historian [[Howard Zinn]], about the life of 19th-century philosopher [[Karl Marx]]. Zinn wrote the play to "show Marx as few people knew him, as a family man, struggling to support his wife and children."&lt;ref&gt;http://bad.eserver.org/reviews/2000/2000-4-25-12.26PM.html&lt;/ref&gt; The play is set in the [[New York City]] neighborhood of [[Soho, Manhattan|Soho]], a humorous nod to the [[London]] [[Soho|neighborhood of the same name]] in which Marx spent much of his life.&lt;ref name="foley"&gt;F. Kathleen Foley. "[http://articles.latimes.com/2001/may/31/entertainment/ca-4527 Communism Alive and, Well, Pithy With 'Marx']". ''Los Angeles Times''. May 31, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Marx in Soho'' has often been produced. The play depicts Marx resurrected to defend the ideals of [[communism]] from the dehumanized version of it practiced in the former [[Soviet Union]] and to defend humanity from [[capitalism]].&lt;ref name="foley"&gt;F. Kathleen Foley. "[http://articles.latimes.com/2001/may/31/entertainment/ca-4527 Communism Alive and, Well, Pithy With 'Marx']". ''Los Angeles Times''. May 31, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Karl Marx.jpg|thumb|upright|Karl Marx, the protagonist of ''Marx in Soho'', in 1875]]

Zinn writes in his foreword that as early as 17, he had seen dramatic evidence "that the machinery of government was not neutral, that, despite its pretensions, it served the capitalist class.... My Communist friends brought me along with them to a demonstration in [[Times Square]]. Hundreds of people unfurled banners proclaiming opposition to war, opposition to [[Fascism]], and marched along the street. I heard sirens. Mounted police charged the crowd. I was knocked unconscious by a plainclothes policeman. When I came to, as my head was clearing, I could only think one troubling thought: the police, the state, did the bidding of the holders of great wealth. How much freedom of speech and freedom of assembly you had depended on what class you were in."&lt;ref name="sohof"&gt;Howard Zinn, [https://books.google.com/books?id=WPKXDJX4Zc4C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PR9 ''Marx in Soho: a play on history''], "Foreword", South End Press, 1999. 88 pages. pp. ix-x, xiv. {{ISBN|0-89608-593-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zinn continued: "[[Karl Marx|Karl]] and [[Jenny von Westphalen|Jenny Marx]] had moved to London after he was expelled from country after country on the European continent. They lived in the grubby [[Soho]] district, and revolutionaries from all over Europe, arriving in London, trooped in and out of their home. That imagined scene — Marx at home, Marx with his wife, Jenny, with his daughter Eleanor — fascinated me."&lt;ref name="sohof" /&gt;

==Reviews==
[[File:Howard Zinn at lectern cropped.jpg|thumb|Historian and playwright Howard Zinn in 2009]]

A ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reviewer, who saw a 2001 performance at the [[Hollywood and Highland|Hollywood and Highland Center]] starring the actor and activist [[Brian Jones (actor)|Brian Jones]], said that the play "mounts a clarion defense of the principles of [[Marxism]], while taking a timely jab at a consumerist culture run amok.... Zinn's indignation oozes through the levity, and Marx's own words remind us that capitalism without conscience is a recipe for revolution."&lt;ref name="foley" /&gt;

''Publishers Weekly'' reviewed the play favourably: "Laid out on the page as seamless monologue, it envisions Marx in the [[SoHo|SoHo district of New York]] in the present, where his mind reels at the same capitalist injustices that boggled him 150 years ago. The wizened and ailing Marx discourses on the economic state of the modern-day U.S., heatedly decrying the vast disparity between rich and poor and the corrupt, systematic funneling of the wealth that workers earn into the hands of capitalists. Through cascading recollections, we learn of Marx's devoted marriage, his love for his children and his stormy debates with [[Mikhail Bakunin]], a fellow radical whose concept of a revolution of the spleen rather than the intellect makes Marx seem cold by comparison.... Most often it is Marx's critical wife, Jenny, and brilliant daughter [[Eleanor Marx|Eleanor]] who take him to task when he fumbles. With Zinn's hefty prologue and scholarly but pointed reading list, the text is a cleverly imagined call to reconsider socialist theory as a valid philosophy in these times. Zinn's point is well made; his passion for history melds with his political vigor to make this a memorable effort and a lucid primer for readers desiring a succinct, dramatized review of Marxism."&lt;ref name="pw"&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Marx-Soho-History-Howard-Zinn/dp/0896085937 ''Publishers Weekly'' Review]. Retrieved January 29, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, the play was performed at the [http://www.spotlighters.org Audrey Herman Spotlighter's Theatre], directed by Sherrionne Brown and featuring [[Phil Gallagher (game designer)|Phil Gallagher]] as Karl Marx. The play was reviewed by [http://www.dcmetrotheaterarts.com DCMetroTheaterArts.com], who said: "... is compelling and passionate and provides uncommon insight into Marx, the man, while also examining Marx, the icon" and "The show puts into stark relief how many of the issues of Marx’s time – income inequality, poverty, and unchecked nationalism – remain with us today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dcmetrotheaterarts.com/2016/09/05/marx-in-soho-at-spotlighters1/|title=Marx in Soho at Spotlighters|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4579">The '''Microsoft acquisition hoax''' is a bogus 1994 press release suggesting that the information technology company [[Microsoft]] had acquired the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. It is considered to be the first Internet hoax to reach a mass audience.&lt;ref name=museum&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/msft.html|first= Alex|last=Boese |title=Microsoft Buys the Catholic Church |work=Museum of Hoaxes|accessdate=2010-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Email Hoaxes: Form, Function, Genre Ecology |last=Heyd |first=Theresa |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2008 |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company |location=Amsterdam |isbn=90-272-5418-4 |page=4 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jUTkPqhvd-wC |accessdate=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hoax comprises part of a [[Joke#Cycles|joke cycle]] in which [[Microsoft Corporation]] is portrayed as a wealthy but evil [[monopoly]] built on bloated or unreliable desktop software, [[planned obsolescence]] of products, [[corporate takeover]]s of once-innovative rivals and litigiousness. While multiple books have been devoted to the subject,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Totally Unauthorized Microsoft Joke Book |author=Tim Barry|publisher=IT Press|year=2002|isbn=9780966741711}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Microsloth Joke Book: A Satire|author=David Pogue|publisher=Berkley Books|year=1997|isbn=9780425160541}}&lt;/ref&gt; the jokes most commonly circulated online as [[Internet meme]]s.

== Press release ==
The hoax consisted of a press release, purportedly from the [[Associated Press]], that circulated around the Internet in 1994. The press release claimed that [[Microsoft]] "will acquire the Roman Catholic Church in exchange for an unspecified number of shares of Microsoft common stock," and that the company expects "a lot of growth in the religious market in the next five to ten years... the combined resources of Microsoft and the Catholic Church will allow us to make religion easier and more fun for a broader range of people."&lt;ref name=release&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ifaq.wap.org/computers/microsoftcatholic.html |title=Microsoft acquires the Catholic Church |work=Washington Apple Pi |accessdate=2010-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the press release's claims were unrealistic, from suggesting that Catholics would soon be able to take [[Holy Communion]] through their computer to claiming that [[religious conversion|conversion]] to Catholicism was an "upgrade". Despite these warning signs, several readers of the false press release contacted Microsoft to confirm the claims of the hoax, and on December 16, 1994, Microsoft formally debunked the claims.&lt;ref name=museum/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7457191.stm |work=BBC NEWS |title= Timeline: Bill Gates and Microsoft |publisher=BBC|accessdate=2010-11-05 |date=2008-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath===
Follow-up press releases made similarly outrageous claims—for example, one false press release claimed that [[IBM]] had acquired the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]], and another suggested that the Italian television network [[RAI]] had invested in what the release claimed to be "Microsoft Corp.'s planned on-line computer service, the Microsoft Divine Network."&lt;ref name=museum/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.2meta.com/april-fools/1994/Microsoft-buys-Vatican.html |title=1994 Fools: Microsoft to Buy Catholic Church|work= April Fools on the Net |publisher=www.2meta.com |accessdate=2010-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[Internet meme]] "Microsoft Acquires" spawned a series of similarly-formatted mock press releases with an assortment of varying acquisition targets, including the government of the [[United States of America]]. According to the release, "United States citizens will be able to expect lower taxes, increases in government services, discounts on all Microsoft products and the immediate arrest of all executive officials of [[Sun Microsystems]] Inc. and [[Netscape]] Corp."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Biggest Joke Book Ever|author= Jack Jacoby|page=283|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qTIwzmQ4oGsC&amp;pg=PA283}}&lt;/ref&gt; One meta-joke claimed that Microsoft ultimately put an end to the jokes by acquiring "Microsoft Acquires".

Despite the proliferation of [[chain letter#Email|chain email]]s circulating the Internet both in 1994 and in the present, the Microsoft hoax was considered the first such hoax to reach a mass audience through the Internet.&lt;ref name=museum/&gt;

The '''microwave auditory effect''', also known as the '''microwave hearing effect''' or the '''Frey effect''', consists of the human perception of audible clicks, or even speech, induced by pulsed or modulated radio frequencies. The communications are generated directly inside the human head without the need of any receiving electronic device. The effect was first reported by persons working in the vicinity of [[radar]] [[transponder]]s during [[World War II]]. In 1961, the [[United States|American]] [[neuroscientist]] Allan H. Frey studied this phenomenon and was the first to publish information on the nature of the microwave auditory effect.&lt;ref name=Frey&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://jap.physiology.org/content/17/4/689.abstract?sid=7c073ad2-6324-4b47-94e1-124dc0a5f154 | journal=Journal of Applied Physiology| volume=17 |pages=689–692 |year=1962| title=Human auditory system response to modulated electromagnetic energy |author=Allan H.

==Research in the U.S.==
Allan H. Frey was the first American to publish on the microwave auditory effect (MAE). Frey's ''Human auditory system response to modulated electromagnetic energy'' appeared in the [[Journal of Applied Physiology]] in 1961. In his experiments, the subjects were discovered to be able to hear appropriately pulsed microwave radiation, from a distance of a few inches to hundreds of feet from the transmitter. In Frey's tests, a repetition rate of 50&amp;nbsp;Hz was used, with pulse width between 10–70 microseconds. The perceived loudness was found to be linked to the peak power density, instead of average power density. At 1.245&amp;nbsp;GHz, the peak power density for perception was below 80&amp;nbsp;mW/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. According to Frey, the induced sounds were described as "a buzz, clicking, hiss, or knocking, depending on several transmitter parameters, i.e., pulse width and pulse-repetition rate". By changing transmitter parameters, Frey was able to induce the "perception of severe buffeting of the head, without such apparent [[vestibular system|vestibular]] symptoms as dizziness or nausea". Other transmitter parameters induced a [[parathesia|pins and needles]] sensation. Frey experimented with nerve-deaf subjects, and speculated that the human detecting mechanism was in the [[cochlea]], but at the time of the experiment the results were inconclusive due to factors such as [[tinnitus]].&lt;ref name=Frey /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kitchen2001" /&gt;

Auditory sensations of clicking or buzzing have been reported by some workers at modern day microwave transmitting sites that emit pulsed microwave radiation. Auditory response to transmitted frequencies from approximately 200&amp;nbsp;MHz to at least 3&amp;nbsp;GHz has been reported. The cause is thought to be thermoelastic expansion of portions of auditory apparatus, and the generally accepted mechanism is rapid (but minuscule, in the range of 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; °C) heating of brain by each pulse, and the resulting pressure wave traveling through the skull to the [[cochlea]].&lt;ref name="Kitchen2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ronald Kitchen|title=RF and Microwave Radiation Safety Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u3XBfkaTQcwC|year=2001|publisher=Newnes|isbn=978-0-7506-4355-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, an article by neuropsychologist Don Justesen discussing radiation effects on human perceptions referred to an experiment by Joseph Sharp and Mark Grove at the [[Walter Reed Army Institute of Research]] during which Sharp and Grove reportedly were able to recognize nine out of ten words transmitted by "voice modulated microwaves". Since the radiation levels approached the (then current) 10mW/cm² limit of safe exposure, critics have observed that under such conditions brain damage from thermal effects of high power microwave radiation would occur, and there was "no conclusive evidence for MAE at lower energy densities".&lt;ref&gt;D. R. Justesen. "Microwaves and Behavior", Am Psychologist, 392 (Mar): 391–401, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Krishnan2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Armin Krishnan|title=Military Neuroscience and the Coming Age of Neurowarfare|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8iIlDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA125|date=4 October 2016|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-09607-8|pages=125–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electronic warfare==

In 2003–04, WaveBand Corp. had a contract from the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] for the design of an MAE system they called [[MEDUSA (weapon)|MEDUSA]] (Mob Excess Deterrent Using Silent Audio) that was intended to temporarily incapacitate personnel through remote application.&lt;ref name=sbir2003&gt;{{cite web | title=Navy search database – summary report: Remote Personnel Incapacitation System | work=SBIR/STTR Search Database (Small Business Innovation Research/Small Business Technology Transfer) | publisher=[[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] | url= http://www.navysbirprogram.com/NavySearch/Summary/summary.aspx?pk=F5B07D68-1B19-4235-B140-950CE2E19D08 | accessdate=12 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, Sierra Nevada Corp. took over the contract from Waveband.&lt;ref name=NewSci20080703&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14250-microwave-ray-gun-controls-crowds-with-noise.html | title=Microwave ray gun controls crowds with noise | last=Hambling | first=David | date=3 July 2008 | work=[[New Scientist]] | accessdate=12 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts, such as Kenneth Foster, a [[University of Pennsylvania]] bioengineering professor who published research on the microwave auditory effect in 1974, have discounted the effectiveness of the proposed device. Foster said that because of human [[biophysics]], the device "would kill you well before you were bothered by the noise". According to former professor at the [[University of Washington]] Bill Guy, ”There’s a misunderstanding by the public and even some scientists about this auditory effect," and "there couldn’t possibly be a hazard from the sound, because the heat would get you first".&lt;ref name="IEEE2008"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Heger|first1=Monica|title=Why Microwave Auditory Effect Crowd-Control Gun Won't Work - Experts say you'd fry before you heard anything|url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/biomedical/devices/why-microwave-auditory-effect-crowdcontrol-gun-wont-work|website=[[IEEE Spectrum]], July 208|publisher=IEEE|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microwave effects have been discussed as a possible source of the otherwise [[Embassy attack accusations in Cuba|unexplained illnesses]] of U.S. diplomats in Cuba and China occurring in 2017 and 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/01/science/sonic-attack-cuba-microwave.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage|title=Microwave Weapons Are Prime Suspect in Ills of U.S. Embassy Workers|first=William| last=Broad|newspaper= New York Times|date=September 1, 2018| access-date=2018-09-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conspiracy theories==
Numerous individuals suffering from [[auditory hallucination]]s, [[delusional disorder]]s,&lt;ref name=kmir20150212&gt;{{citation |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150829083519/http://www.scrippsmedia.com/kmir6/news/179055911.html |url=http://www.scrippsmedia.com/kmir6/news/179055911.html |title=Electronic Harassment: Voices in My Mind |last=Monroe|first=Angela |date=13 November 2012 |archive-date=2015-08-29|access-date=2016-03-10|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; or other [[mental illnesses]] have claimed that government agents use forms of [[mind control]] technologies based on microwave signals to transmit sounds and thoughts into their heads as a form of [[electronic harassment]], referring to the alleged technology as "voice to skull" or "V2K".&lt;ref name=WaPo20070114&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/10/AR2007011001399.html |title=Mind Games |last=Weinberger|first=Sharon |date=January 14, 2007 | work=[[Washington Post]] |accessdate=12 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are extensive online support networks and numerous websites &lt;ref name=kmir20150212 /&gt; maintained by people fearing mind control. California psychiatrist Alan Drucker has identified evidence of [[delusional disorder]]s on many of these websites and other psychologists are divided over whether such sites reinforce mental troubles, or act as a form of group social support.&lt;ref name=nyt20081112&gt;{{cite news | title=Sharing Their Demons on the Web | last = Kershaw | first=Sarah | newspaper=[[New York Times]] | date = November 12, 2008 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/13/fashion/13psych.html?pagewanted=all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologists have identified many examples of people reporting 'mind control experiences' (MCEs) on self-published web pages that are "highly likely to be influenced by delusional beliefs". Common themes include "Bad Guys" using "[[psychotronics]]" and "microwaves", frequent mention of the CIA's [[MKULTRA]] project, and frequent citing of a scientific paper entitled "Human auditory system response to modulated electromagnetic energy".&lt;ref name="Psychopathology"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bell|first1=Vaughan|last2=Maiden|first2=Carla|last3=Muñoz-Solomando|first3=Antonio|last4=Reddy|first4=Venu|title='Mind control' experiences on the  internet: implications for the psychiatric diagnosis of delusions.|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.99.9838&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|website=Psychopathology|publisher=School of Psychology, Cardiff University|accessdate=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Intellectual property}}
In [[law]], '''misappropriation''' is the unauthorized use of another's name, likeness, or identity without that person's permission, resulting in harm to that person.

Another use of the word refers to intentional and illegal use of property or funds; it can particularly refer to when done by a [[public official]].

==Criminal law==
In criminal law, misappropriation is the intentional, illegal use of the [[property]] or funds of another person for one's own use or other unauthorized purpose, particularly by a public official, a [[trustee]] of a [[Trust law|trust]], an executor or administrator of a deceased person's [[estate (law)|estate]] or by any person with a responsibility to care for and protect another's assets (a [[fiduciary]] duty). Depending upon the [[jurisdiction]] and value of the property, misappropriation may be a [[felony]], a crime punishable by a prison sentence.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==Scientific research==
In [[scientific method|scientific]] [[research]], misappropriation is a type of research misconduct. An investigator, scholar or reviewer can obtain novel ideas during the process of the exchange of ideas amongst colleagues and peers. However, improper use of such information could constitute fraud. This can include [[plagiarism]] of work or to make use of any information in breach of any duty of [[confidentiality]] associated with the review of manuscripts or grant applications.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==Consequences of misappropriation==
Misappropriation can have very serious consequences, including imprisonment, fines, [[probation]], and a permanent criminal record.

The punishment for misappropriation may be determined by the value of the property affected and previous criminal record.

==Defenses==
Since misappropriation is considered a form of theft, arguments countering charges of theft can be modified and utilized against misappropriation, including:

*Property did not belong to the plaintiff. Information which is available to everyone, such as facts in a news story, is considered public and thus cannot be owned by the plaintiff.
*Independent development of property. The defendant did not “take” the plaintiff’s trade secrets if the defendant created the trade secrets independent of the plaintiff’s knowledge, resources and involvement.
*Consent by the plaintiff. If the plaintiff had given the defendant permission to use the property for a purpose, then the defendant cannot be guilty of misuse if the defendant used the property for that purpose.

==Differences between misappropriation and embezzlement==
[[Embezzlement]] is misappropriation when the property or funds involved have been lawfully entrusted to the embezzler. In circumstances where the funds are accessible to, but not entrusted to, the perpetrator, it is not embezzlement but can still be considered [[larceny]], misappropriation, misapplication, or some other similar term.

==Examples of misappropriation==
For an example, see [https://web.archive.org/web/20131112193722/http://www.courts.ca.gov/partners/documents/caci_2013_edition.pdf §1803] of the Judicial Council of California's Civil Jury Instructions from 2013.

== About Northern Voice ==
The idea for a Canadian blogging conference was first mentioned on Darren Barefoot's blog in March 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darrenbarefoot.com/archives/2004/03/survey-a-weblogging-conference-in-vancouver.html Darren Barefoot's blog]&lt;/ref&gt;{{FV|date=December 2014}} 

Conference organizers included Darren Barefoot, [[Kris Krug]], Brian Lamb, Cyprien Lomas, Boris Mann, James Sherret, Travis Smith, Julie Szabo, Roland Tanglao, Lauren Wood, Dale McGladdery, Shane Birley, Allyson McGrane, and Jonathon Narvey.

Northern Voice started as a one-day event, held on Saturdays. In 2007, a second day was added, for an [[unconference]] known as Moose Camp.&lt;ref name="nv 2007"&gt;[http://2007.northernvoice.ca/about Northern Voice 2007 website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussion topics included "how blogging interacts with family life, education, travel, photography, community building and establishing professional profiles."&lt;ref name="nv 2007" /&gt;

'''Poly Implant Prothèse''' ('''PIP''') was a French company founded in 1991 that produced [[silicone gel]] [[breast implant]]s. The company was preemptively [[liquidation|liquidated]] in 2010 following the revelation that they had been illegally manufacturing and selling breast implants made from cheaper industrial-grade silicone since 2001 (instead of the mandated medical-grade silicone they had previously used). The hundreds of thousands of unapproved implants sold globally by PIP from 2001 to 2010 were found to have a 500% higher risk of [[Breast implant#Complications|rupturing or leaking]] than approved models, as well as being implicated in at several deaths due to systemic toxicity and several cases of induced [[breast cancer]]. The scandal, which produced fears of a massive health disaster, prompted a full recall of the company's implants by the French health ministry in 2010, by which time the company was already defunct.&lt;ref name=stbr&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-breast-implants-idUSTRE7BM14420111224 |title=France, UK issue clashing advice on breast implants |author1=Love, B. |author2=Flynn, D. |work=Reuters |publisher=Thomson Reuters |date=23 December 2011 |accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Breast implants in hand 01.jpg|thumb|280px|Breast implant]]
PIP was founded in 1991&lt;ref name=stbr/&gt; by the Frenchman&lt;ref name=ia/&gt; Jean-Claude Mas, born in 1939, a former [[butcher]] and later [[Pharmaceutical sales representative|medical sales representative]] for the [[Bristol-Myers Squibb|Bristol Myers]] company&lt;ref name=tlback/&gt; for 15 years.&lt;ref name=gmmi/&gt; Mas had previously teamed up with plastic surgeon Henri Arion, who had introduced breast implants to France in 1965.&lt;ref name=tlback/&gt; After Arion died in a plane crash, Mas went on alone and launched PIP in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The terrifying story of how a former French butcher earned millions from selling faulty breast implants made from mattress filling |author=Steve Bird |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2080547/PIP-breast-implant-butcher-Jean-Claude-Mas-denies-manslaughter-charges.html?ito=feeds-newsxml |newspaper=[[Daily Mail]] |date=December 31, 2011 |accessdate=December 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scandal==
Starting in 1991, the company produced approximately 2 million sets of silicone breast implants over a 20-year period. The implants were exported to Latin American countries such as [[Brazil]],&lt;ref name=stbr/&gt; [[Venezuela]]&lt;ref name=nc/&gt; and [[Argentina]], Western European markets including [[United Kingdom|Britain]] (25,000), [[Germany]], [[Spain]] and [[Italy]], as well as [[Australia]] (8900).&lt;ref name=stbr/&gt;

Following the FDA ruling in 2000 which banned silicone breast implants in the US market (leading to a slump in sales worldwide), Mas sought to "tighten PIP's belt" and recoup some of its lost [[market share]] by severely cutting costs. In particular, Mas was credited with the idea that by switching PIP's silicone from externally purchased medical-grade to in-house produced industrial-grade, huge savings (on the order of 90%) could be generated that would ensure profits remained high no matter the market. As one PIP engineer later noted, 
this decision involved a relatively small change in the formula for the silicone, enough so that only superficial differences in the end product were noted. However, none of the relevant regulations were followed for manufacturing medical implants, and no pre-launch tests were conducted.

== Timeline ==
2000: Implant sales in [[United States|USA]] halted by an [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] launched moratorium on silicone implants.&lt;ref name=uslaw/&gt;

2001: PIP began to use unapproved in-house manufactured industrial-grade instead of [[Medical grade silicone|medical-grade]] [[silicone]] in the majority of its implants.&lt;ref name=stbr/&gt;

2003: the first signs of legal problems and financial losses can be traced by regulatory filings.&lt;ref name=stbr/&gt;

2009: Concerns surfaced in France first in 2009 when surgeons started reporting an abnormally high rupture rates. Which resulted in a flood of legal complaints and the company's bankruptcy.&lt;ref name=stbr/&gt;

2010: [[TÜV Rheinland]], headquartered in [[Germany]], gave a quality certificate to the production process used by the company until March 2010. However, this didn't apply to the type of silicone used. A former PIP worker and union chief, Eric Mariaccia said, "You had to have been a chemist to have noticed anything".&lt;ref name=chiboss/&gt; He also said that "The responsible ones aren't the workers but the heads of the company, notably the four who were linked to production and thus responsible for their quality".&lt;ref name=chiboss/&gt;

2010: In March 2010 PIP was placed into liquidation with losses of {{nowrap|9 million [[Euro|EUR]]}} after the French medical safety agency recalled its implants. In a subsequent inspection of the manufacturing site, the company was found to use unapproved industrial-grade, [[silicone]], with a cost of only 10% of an approved gel.&lt;ref name=stbr/&gt;

2011: On December 20 French officials say that an action plan is underway&lt;ref name=gr/&gt; following the death of a woman from [[Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma|ALCL]].&lt;ref name=mhra-upd/&gt; The French government recommended on December 23, 2011&lt;ref name=rt/&gt; that 30,000 women&lt;ref name=stbr/&gt; in France seek removal of breast implants made of a suspect silicone gel by the worldwide exporting PIP firm.&lt;ref name=rt/&gt;

== Issues ==
Medical problems arise when breast implants rupture and cause [[inflammation]] and [[irritation]]. Further, impure gel may also release toxic substances.&lt;ref name=swbo/&gt; Removing implants "carries risks in itself", says the French government.&lt;ref name=stbr/&gt; By the end of 2011, eight cases of [[Breast cancer|breast tumours]] had been uncovered in women after removing the implants, yet, while of concern,&lt;ref name=swbo/&gt; according to the French government, there is no evidence of any increased [[cancer]] risk.&lt;ref name=stbr/&gt;

The [[United Kingdom|UK]] medical watchdog, the [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency|Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority]] (MHRA), says France has reported rupture rates of around 5% for PIP implants, compared with 1% in the UK.&lt;ref name=bbc-dd/&gt; But a "leading cosmetic surgery firm" has privately warned ministers that the proportion of women at risk is as high as 8%.&lt;ref name=in8/&gt; Symptoms can include lumps around the implant or in the under-arm, inflammation in the breast tissue and a hardening of the breast.&lt;ref name=in8&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/exclusive-silicone-implant-risk-eight-times-greater-6283809.html independent.co.uk - Exclusive: Silicone implant risk 'eight times greater], 2012-01-01&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patient UK]] says French regulatory authority has reported a rupture rate of up to 10%, with a gel leak in 11% of cases.&lt;ref name=ptsc/&gt;

Nigel Mercer of the [[British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons|British Association of Aesthetic and Plastic Surgeons]] (BAAPS) says the French move was "certainly not unreasonable" but the British cosmetic surgeon Kevin Hancock said the divergent government responses would cause distress for British women. [[Plastic surgery|Plastic surgeon]] Hancock, of the [[Liverpool Women's Hospital]], says there were concerns in the profession over a high rupture rate and that "We are worried about the rupture risk because it is the rupture that brings the contents into direct contact with the body's tissues... We know that the contents were not what they were supposed to be. So in general we agree with the (French) decision to remove them".&lt;ref name=stbr/&gt;

Patients are used as "guinea pigs", said Nigel Mercer, a former president of the British Association of Aesthetic and Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS), because medical implants lack the requirement of an independent [[clinical trial]].&lt;ref name=bbc-al/&gt;

The company sold a high-end product that used approved silicone for wealthier clients and which cost five times more than products with silicon gel manufactured in-house. Most PIP implants were manufactured with the in-house silicon. The lawyer, Haddad, representing the founder, said "There is a product made by PIP which did not formally receive the [regulators'] approval and in this regard there was a violation of regulations,". The company did not ask France's medical device safety regulators for approval of their in-house manufactured product, but expected it would have gotten approval if the company asked for it.&lt;ref name=rerg/&gt;

Cancer has been found in 20 women with the allegedly faulty PIP breast implants but French health authorities ([[Agence française de sécurité sanitaire des produits de santé]] (AFSSAPS)) insisted there was still no proven link with the disease.&lt;ref name=mx&gt;[http://medicalxpress.com/news/2011-12-cancer-cases-french-women-pip.html medicalxpress.com - 20 cancer cases in French women with PIP implants: agency], 2011-12-30&lt;/ref&gt;

AFSSAPS has as of 28 December,{{When|date=June 2012}} registered 15 cases of breast [[adenocarcinoma]], the most frequent form of breast cancer, one case of breast [[lymphoma]], two cases of other lymphoma, one case of [[lung cancer]] and one case of acute [[myelogenous leukemia]] in women with the implants.&lt;ref name=mx/&gt;

A French woman with a PIP breast implant where [[Capsular contracture|capsular]] [[Granulation tissue|scar tissue]] formed in the breast, which is a common occurrence with implants.&lt;ref name=ptsc/&gt; This tissue developed [[anaplastic large-cell lymphoma]] (ALCL), a rare form of cancer that affects the immune system cells.&lt;ref name=mhra-upd/&gt; The cancer caused death in this case and caused the French authorities to act.&lt;ref name=mhra-upd/&gt;&lt;!-- grammar check? --&gt;

During the 672 registered preventive extractions, in 43 cases (6.4%) the implants had ruptured and in 14 cases (2.1%) they were "oozing", AFSSAPS said.&lt;ref name=mx/&gt;
 
The PIP implants have been resold as "Rofil M-implants".&lt;ref name=tet/&gt;
British Association of Aesthetic and Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) believes many British women may have had the bad Rofil M-implants used when they bought cut-price breast enlargement surgery from clinics in [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]]  and [[Central Europe]].&lt;ref name=tet/&gt;

The PIP factory was shut down and their products banned after it was found they had used the chemicals Baysilone, Silopren and Rhodorsil in their implants.&lt;ref name=tet/&gt; These chemicals are normally used as [[List of gasoline additives|fuel additive]]s or in the manufacture of industrial [[Synthetic rubber|rubber]]&lt;!--assumed synthetic, not natural--&gt; tubing.&lt;ref name=tet/&gt;

In 1993, there was an availability crisis of silicone materials for use in medical long-term implant applications.&lt;ref name=nush&gt;[http://www.nusil.com/products/healthcare/index.aspx nusil.com - Healthcare products] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204224215/http://www.nusil.com/products/healthcare/index.aspx |date=4 February 2012 }}, 2012, read 2012-01-26&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, Mas ordered the staff to "hide the truth" and "We did it for 13 years without a problem".&lt;ref name=gucont/&gt; The PIP gel cost {{nowrap|5 [[Euro|EUR]]}} per litre while the authorized American gel Nusil cost {{nowrap|35 EUR}} per litre. The PIP implants were made with 75% non-authorised gel and 25% Nusil.&lt;ref name=gucont/&gt; "The material was better than that used to make the officially authorised gel," Mas said. "Usually, from 1997 onwards we hid the products used to make the PIP gel. I wasn't allowed to buy these products because they were not authorised. We organised everything to escape being monitored."&lt;ref name=gucont/&gt; Investigators interviewed Mas on 18 and 19 November 2010 after the French health authority [[Agence française de sécurité sanitaire des produits de santé|AFSSAPS]] discovered the PIP breast implants did not conform to regulations. They passed the case to a judge who ordered a police inquiry for "aggravated deception".&lt;ref name=gucont&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/06/french-breast-implant-firm-boss-unrepentant?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487 guardian.co.uk - French breast implant firm boss unrepentant over unauthorised silicone], 2012-01-06&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chest, testicle and buttock implants ==
The bad silicone has been used to make male [[chest]], [[testicle]]&lt;ref name=tet/&gt;&lt;ref name=ndt/&gt;&lt;ref name=nzt/&gt; and [[buttock]] implants as well.&lt;ref name=nzt/&gt; "Three people were specially trained to work with a machine that made silicon testicles'" said a former PIP worker.&lt;ref name=nzt/&gt;&lt;!--France's Le Parisien--&gt;

Most of the male chest, buttock and testicle implants were exported to [[Latin America]].&lt;ref name=nzt/&gt;

== Impact per country ==

=== France ===
The French government recommended per December 23, 2011&lt;ref name=rt/&gt; that 30,000 women&lt;ref name=stbr/&gt; in France seek removal of breast implants made by PIP.&lt;ref name=rt&gt;REUTERS/Interpol/Handout&lt;/ref&gt; For women that want to keep their implants, the state will pay for a six-month ultrasound scan.&lt;ref name=bbc-dd/&gt;

French public health care funds will be used to finance the recommended implant removals, at a cost estimated at {{nowrap|60 million [[Euro|EUR]]}}. New implants will be paid for in cases where they were used initially for medical reasons, others will need to finance a new implant by themselves. Associations representing women with PIP implants demand that public funds cover all cases. "This announcement is just a smokescreen and the victims of PIP are angry," said Alexandra Blachere, head of the association of PIP implant users in France.&lt;ref name=stbr/&gt;

A government [[Helpline|hotline]] has been set up by December 2011.&lt;ref name=rerg/&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
In Britain, there are an estimated 30,000{{ndash}}40,000 affected women. The chief Medical Officer Dame Sally Davies said, "Women with PIP implants should not be unduly worried. We have no evidence of a link to cancer or an increased risk of rupture. If women are concerned they should speak to their surgeon". Removing the implant "carries risks in itself," she said.&lt;ref name=stbr/&gt;

Concerns were filed with the [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency|MHRA]] in 2009 when a lump was found during a [[Mammography|mammogram]] and [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound scan]] in a female patients breast but no action was taken by MHRA at the time.&lt;ref name=bbc-al/&gt;

Shadow Health Secretary [[Andy Burnham]] said private clinics in Britain that fitted PIP implants must be forced to pick up the cost of removing them.&lt;ref name=tet/&gt;

On 6 January 2012, [[National Health Service|NHS]] officials began to offer examinations and possible removal - in instances where a doctor ruled that necessary. They also called on private medical centers to offer the same deal to patients who had paid for private sector cosmetic surgery.&lt;ref name=bhre&gt;[http://www.bellinghamherald.com/2012/01/06/2338588/czech-republic-recommends-faulty.html bellinghamherald.com - Mixed advice in Europe over faulty breast implants], 2012-01-06&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 January 2012, ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' reported that leading cosmetic surgeon [[Jan Stanek]] had conducted a study with colleague Mike Berry into PIP implants. Their report to the Journal of Plastic and Aesthetic Surgery revealed that, in an audit of 453 patients, between 16% and 34% of the PIP implants ruptured. This compared to a failure rate of less than 1% in other implants.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah-Kate Templeton, John Follain, 'Leak Rate Of Faulty Implants Is 1 in 3 In The UK' {{cite web |url=http://www.janstanek.com/file/comment_pdf_1326041882781050132.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524045639/http://www.janstanek.com/file/comment_pdf_1326041882781050132.pdf |archivedate=24 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}, The Sunday Times, 8 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany and Brazil ===
Germany's medical safety board and Brazil's health watchdog called for users of PIP implants to visit their doctor for checks.&lt;ref name=stbr/&gt;

On 6 January 2012 Germany's [[Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices]] recommended the removal of PIP breast implants as a precaution.&lt;ref name=bhre/&gt;

=== Netherlands ===
The bad breast implants were sold to about 1000 [[Dutch people|Dutch]] women under the name "M-implants" by the Dutch importer Rofil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Advocaat: artsen kozen voor die implantaten' (transl.: Lawyer: doctors opted for those implants|url= http://nos.nl/artikel/2047963-advocaat-artsen-kozen-voor-die-implantaten.html|publisher= [[NOS Nieuws]]|date= 20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Healthcare in the Netherlands|Dutch healthcare]] spokeswoman Diana Bouhys said, "We have advised them to consult their physician", but also declined to disclose the name of the company. PIP was the third largest maker of breast implants in the world.&lt;ref name=gmmi&gt;[http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/242781/news/world/sub-standard-breast-implants-sold-to-dutch-firm-under-new-name gmanetwork.com - Sub-standard breast implants sold to Dutch firm under new name], 2011-12-27&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sweden ===
Approximately 5000 implants have already been sold, corresponding to an estimated 2500 Swedish women with the controversial implants. Nine clinics in Sweden has sold them says Gert Bruse of the [[Medical Products Agency (Sweden)|Swedish Medical Products Agency]] (Läkemedelsverket) told the [[Dagens Nyheter]] (DN) newspaper this week. The agency also recommends that the implants to be removed.

Sweden banned the company's implants in March 2010, along with many other European countries, when it was discovered that substandard silicone gel was causing unusually many implants to burst. "We've had cases where the implants have burst in Sweden, but it's fewer than in France in relation to how many women have these implants in both countries... Implants shouldn't burst and they shouldn't have an irritating effect that spreads throughout the body. What this company has done is criminal, simply put." said Bruse. PIP's implants have only been used in cosmetic breast augmentation surgery, not in reconstructive surgery.&lt;ref name=swbo&gt;[http://www.thelocal.se/38116/20111223/ thelocal.se - Swedish women warned over French fake boobs], 2011-12-23&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Finland and Estonia ===
Patients from Finland often visit [[Tallinn]] to get cosmetic surgery. In October 2011 (two months before 22 December 2011), a Finnish woman in her 30s had received a different implant than what was agreed to in advance. An M-implant with the same type code as the implant from PIP was inserted instead of a promised [[Allergan]] implant. At least two Estonian clinics operating in Tallinn have offered M-implants as recently as December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Finnish+woman+got+dangerous+breast+implant+in+Estonia/1135270081610|title=Finnish woman got dangerous breast implant in Estonia|date=2011-12-22|publisher=www.hs.fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
Documents filed with the US government show that implants were sold until May 2000 through Heritage Worldwide, when the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] launched a moratorium on silicone implants. At the time, the US market accounted for 40% of Heritage Worldwide's revenues, or {{nowrap|3 million [[Euro|EUR]]}}, according to corporate documents filed in 2009 with the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC).  In 2007 significant losses started as both users and distributors filed complaints. Between 1996 and 2009, PIP was targeted by several dozen lawsuits in the United States, filed by users and business partners, claiming breach of contract or unmet payments. Starting in 2003, dozens of women began filing lawsuits mainly for product liability against PIP. However, as of 2009, no trial date had yet been set. Many of the lawsuits were later dismissed.&lt;ref name=uslaw&gt;[http://www.thelocal.fr/2128/20111227/ thelocal.fr - French breast implant maker faced US lawsuits], 2011-12-27&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Italy ===
On 29 December Health Minister [[Renato Balduzzi]] said that hospitals and clinics are required to compile a list of women who has received breast implants from PIP. Even clinics that didn't use any PIP implants will be required to send a declaration stating that.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/Italy-orders-list-of-women-with-French-firms-implants jpost.com - Italy orders list of women with French firm's implants], 2011-12-29&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Czech Republic ===
Czech Republic health ministry said about 2000 women with potentially faulty implants should have them removed.&lt;ref name=bhre/&gt;

=== Iceland ===
According to the Icelandic Directorate of Health, 440 women underwent breast surgery where PIP breast implants were used. The Ministry of Welfare have stated that health insured women will be offered counsel and ultrasound examination, free of charge. The Ministry of Welfare also stated that in the event that the implant is leaking, the government will pay a portion of the cost to have it removed.&lt;ref name=gvre&gt;[http://grapevine.is/Home/ReadArticle/Government-Will-Assist-With-Breast-Implant-Removal grapevine.is - Government Will Assist With Breast Implant Removal], 2012-01-10&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ministry of Health and Medical Education (Iran)|Ministry of Health and Medical Education]] banned the breast implants and took them off the market in 2012. They advised women that used the products to consult with a doctor and if deemed a health threat, to have them removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/iran/2012/01/120129_l21_cancer_pip_implantes.shtml|title=جمع آوری سیلیکون های غیراستاندارد پستان از بازار ایران|date= 2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European Union ===
The adequacy of regulations on silicone-filled breast implants, investigation by the regulatory authorities and advice given to women implanted with PIP silicone pre-filled breast implants was criticized in December 2012 in a report examining information publicly available from the regulatory authorities.&lt;ref name=qfi_pr25&gt;{{cite web|title=Quality First International Limited Medical Devices Consultancy|url=http://www.qualityfirstint.com/info_center/pressreleases/pr25.htm|date=2013-01-07|accessdate=2013-01-17|publisher=qualityfirstint.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== New company ==
A new firm has been registered under the name France Implant Technologie (FIT), with Mas' son Nicolas Lucciardi, 27, and daughter, Peggy Lucciardi, 24, at the address of their mother, Dominique Lucciardi, who was Mas' former civil partner.&lt;ref name=nc/&gt;

The local paper Nice-Matin obtained the business plan in which Mas is named as a "technical-commercial consultant" to the company and described as "a creative genius". Two former PIP managers were listed in senior positions in the company. With the objective to export implants to the "European, South American and Chinese markets". An investment of {{nowrap|2 million [[Euro|EUR]]}} was planned to put the former PIP plant back into operation, aiming to manufacture 400 implants a day with about 20 workers. However, Nicolas Lucciardi said that the project had collapsed due to media coverage of the scandal, adding, "That's obvious".&lt;ref name=nc&gt;[http://www.english.rfi.fr/americas/20111230-french-breast-implant-fraud-boss-tries-start-new-company rfi.fr - French breast implant fraud boss tries to start new company], 2011-12-30&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal process ==
The lawyer Yves Haddad is representing Mas.&lt;ref name=stbr/&gt; Legal complaints have been filed by 2500 women&lt;ref name=nc/&gt; in France and 250 women in Britain. Mas is wanted in &lt;!--[[France]] and--&gt; [[Costa Rica]] for "life and health" offenses, a warrant issued by [[Interpol]].&lt;ref name=stbr/&gt;

By February 2011, [[TÜV Rheinland]] sued PIP, claiming it had been "thoroughly and continuously misled" regarding the silicone used.&lt;ref name=stbr/&gt; Many [[Senior management|executive]]s are expected to face charges of [[aggravated fraud]] in an ongoing court case in France, expected to be scheduled for October 2012, which carries the possibility of [[prison]] terms of up to five years.&lt;ref name=stbr/&gt;
The death of a cancer victim who had such implants may result in more serious charges of [[Manslaughter#Involuntary manslaughter|involuntary manslaughter]].&lt;ref name=stbr/&gt;

Frédéric Van Roekeghem, general director for La Caisse Nationale d'Assurance Maladie (French state social insurance agency, CNAM), will go to court regarding the complaints of bad implants. A criminal charge will be made within a few days he said to [[TF1]] on 25 December 2011.

== Aftermath ==
British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) says that poor [[postmarketing surveillance]] is the root of the crisis, and proposes significantly more stringent monitoring of all medical devices including breast implants and all cosmetic injectables, via compulsory, regular reporting of adverse effects and [[mystery shopping]]. Professor Sir [[Bruce Keogh]], the [[National Health Service (England)|NHS]] Medical Director, will look into whether the cosmetic surgery industry needs to be more effectively regulated.&lt;ref name="bbc_lessons"&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC News - PIP breast implants: &amp;#039;serious lessons must be learned&amp;#039;|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-18057761|date=2012-05-14|accessdate=2013-04-17|publisher=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23499">{{Good article}}The '''Pusztai affair''' is a controversy that began in 1998. [[Protein]] scientist [[Árpád Pusztai]] went public with the initial results of unpublished research he was conducting at the [[Rowett Institute]] in Aberdeen, Scotland, investigating the possible effects of [[genetically modified potato]]es upon rats. Pusztai claimed that the genetically modified potatoes had stunted growth and repressed the rats' immune systems while thickening their gut mucosa. Initially supported by the Rowett Institute, his  comments on a British television programme caused a storm of controversy and the Rowett Institute withdrew its support. Pusztai was suspended and misconduct procedures were used to seize his data and ban him from speaking publicly. The Institute did not renew his annual contract and Pusztai was criticized by the British Royal Society and some other scientists for making an announcement before his experiment was complete or peer-reviewed, and for the experiment's design, methodology and analysis. Some of the data from the study was eventually published in The Lancet in 1999 after five out of six peer reviewers approved of the study&lt;ref name="Academic Experts, Higher Education Profile"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Randerson|first1=James|title=Arpad Pusztai: Biological divide|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/jan/15/academicexperts.highereducationprofile|accessdate=5 December 2017|agency=The Guardian|publisher=The Guardian|date=15 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; – triggering further controversy.

==Background==
Before 1995, no peer-reviewed studies had been published investigating the safety of [[genetically modified food]] using human or animal feeding trials.&lt;ref name = "Domingo"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Domingo JL| title = Toxicity Studies of Genetically Modified Plants: A Review of the Published Literature | doi = 10.1080/10408390601177670 | journal = Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition | volume = 47 | issue = 8 | pages = 721–733 | year = 2007 | pmid =  17987446| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 the Scottish [[Scottish Government Environment Directorates|Agriculture Environment and Fisheries Department]] commissioned a £1.6 million three-year research study to assess the safety of [[genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] [[desiree potato|Desiree Red potatoes]].&lt;ref name="Arpad article"/&gt; The potatoes had been developed by biochemist&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dur.ac.uk/biosciences/research/staffprofiles/?id=13 Professor J.A. Gatehouse – Durham University&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201040806/https://www.dur.ac.uk/biosciences/research/staffprofiles/?id=13 |date=2016-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; John Gatehouse at Cambridge Agricultural Genetics (later renamed Axis Genetics) and had recently completed two years of field trials at [[Rothamsted Experimental Station]].&lt;ref name="Arpad article"/&gt; The GNA gene from the [[Galanthus]] (snowdrop) plant was inserted into the potato, allowing the GNA [[Lectin|lectin protein]] to be [[Protein biosynthesis|synthesised]].&lt;ref name="Lancet"/&gt; This lectin has been shown to be toxic to some insects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Murdock | first1 = L. L. | last2 = Shade | first2 = R. E. | doi = 10.1021/jf020192c | title = Lectins and Protease Inhibitors as Plant Defenses against Insects | journal = Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry | volume = 50 | issue = 22 | pages = 6605–6611 | year = 2002 | pmid =  12381159| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty-eight studies were proposed, of which eight were  selected for peer review by the [[Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council]]. From these eight the [[Rowett Research Institute]]'s proposal was chosen and a combined team of academics from the [[Scottish Crop Research Institute]], the [[Durham University|Durham University Department of Biology]] and the Rowett Institute was assembled, and coordinated by Pusztai.&lt;ref name="Arpad article"/&gt;

Although the tested potatoes were not a commercial variety and not intended for human consumption&lt;ref name="Randerson2"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/jan/15/academicexperts.highereducationprofile Arpad Pusztai: Biological divide] James Randerson [[The Guardian]] January 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; a contract was signed with Cambridge Agricultural Genetics, which included a profit-sharing agreement, if potatoes developed using this technology were approved and released commercially.&lt;ref name="Arpad article"&gt;Arpad Pusztai ''GM Food Safety: Scientific and Institutional Issues'' Science as Culture, Volume 11 Number 1 March 2002&lt;/ref&gt; In earlier ten-day feeding trials on GNA-fed rats, Pusztai concluded that they did not significantly affect growth, despite some [[hypertrophy]] of the small intestine and a slight decrease of gut [[enzyme]] activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Pusztai | first1 = A. | last2 = Koninkx | first2 = J. | last3 = Hendriks | first3 = H. | last4 = Kok | first4 = W. | last5 = Hulscher | first5 = S. | last6 = Van Damme | first6 = E.

==Experiment==
The experimental potatoes had been [[transformation (genetics)|transformed]] with the ''[[Galanthus nivalis]] [[agglutinin]]'' (GNA) [[gene]] from the ''[[Galanthus]]'' (snowdrop) plant, allowing the GNA [[lectin|lectin protein]] to be [[Protein biosynthesis|synthesised]]. This lectin is toxic to some insects. Rats were fed raw and cooked genetically modified potatoes, using unmodified [[Désirée (potato)|Desiree Red potatoes]] as [[scientific control|controls]]. One control group ate an unmodified Desiree Red potato spiked with the GNA snowdrop lectin.&lt;ref name="Lancet" /&gt; Twelve feeding experiments were conducted, ten short-term (10 days) and two long-term (110 days).&lt;ref name="audit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rowett.ac.uk/gmoarchive/gmaudit.pdf |title=Audit of data produced at the Rowett Research Institute|date=21 August 1998|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927104039/http://www.rowett.ac.uk/gmoarchive/gmaudit.pdf |archivedate=27 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the experiment Pusztai and his team said they expected no differences between the rats fed modified potatoes and rats fed the non-modified ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=James Meikle|newspaper=The Guardian|date=5 October 1999|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/1999/oct/05/gm.food|title=Journal to publish GM food hazards research|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arpad Interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthcoalition.ca/pusztai.html|title=Interview with Arpad Pusztai|publisher=Canadian Health Coalition|4=|date=10 November 2000|access-date=2010-11-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722080050/http://www.healthcoalition.ca/pusztai.html#|archive-date=2010-07-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The potatoes were chosen because they were deemed [[Substantial equivalence|substantially equivalent]] to non-genetically modified Desiree Red potatoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Millstone | first1 = E. | last2 = Brunner | first2 = E. | last3 = Mayer | first3 = S. | title = Beyond 'substantial equivalence' | journal = Nature | volume = 401 | issue = 6753 | pages = 525–526 | year = 1999 | doi = 10.1038/44006 | pmid =  10524614| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study used two [[Transgenesis|transgenic]] lines of potato, both with the GNA gene inserted. They were grown in the same conditions as the non-genetically modified parent plant.&lt;ref name="audit" /&gt; According to Pusztai, the potatoes were not substantially equivalent, as one of the transgenic lines contained 20 percent less [[Protein (nutrient)|protein]] than the other, and the [[starch]] and sugar contents varied by up to 20 percent among the three lines.&lt;ref name="Tokar"&gt;Brian Tokar ''Redesigning life?: the worldwide challenge to genetic engineering''  [[Zed Books]] Pg 58 {{ISBN|1-85649-835-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pusztai claimed that these differences were reason enough to discontinue further experimentation.&lt;ref name="Tokar" /&gt;

Their experiment showed a [[statistically significant]] difference in the thickness of the stomach [[mucosa]]. The mucosa of rats fed raw or cooked potato modified with the GNA gene was thicker than that of rats fed the unmodified potato.&lt;ref name="Lancet" /&gt; The [[Crypt (anatomy)|crypt]] length in the [[jejunum]] was greater on rats fed the raw modified potato, although there was no statistical difference observed in the rats fed the cooked potato.&lt;ref name="Lancet" /&gt; As these effects were not observed in rats fed the control potatoes spiked with GNA, Pusztai concluded that the differences were a result of the transformation procedure, rather than the presence of GNA.&lt;ref name="Lancet" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Arpad Interview" /&gt; Pusztai's collaborator Stanley Ewen said that the [[cauliflower mosaic virus]] used as a [[Promoter (biology)|promoter]] could likely be the cause of the observed changes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nature.berkeley.edu/~steggall/15Jan99-22Apr99.html Evidence of changes in the organs of rats fed genetically modified potatoes suggests minister's safety assurances may be premature]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} The Guardian February 13, 1999 archived Berkeley University&lt;/ref&gt;

==Announcement==
On June 22, 1998 Pusztai revealed his research findings during an interview on [[Granada Television]]'s current affairs programme ''[[World in Action]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/171778|publisher=The Economist|title=Potato-heads|date=Aug 13, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; titled "Eat up your genes".&lt;ref&gt;[http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/596535?view=transmission  Eat Up Your Genes (1998)]&lt;/ref&gt; He was given permission to do the interview by Rowett Institute Director Philip James. Rowett's press officer was present at the start of filming. During the interview Pusztai said he had "concerns that some of the testing techniques are not up to what we thought it was necessary to do, and therefore we should have more testing."&lt;ref name = "Memorandum"/&gt; When asked why he felt concerned, he said "it was because we had done some experiments which made us feel concerned" and discussed his results in general terms.&lt;ref name = "Memorandum"/&gt;

Pusztai later said that at the time of the interview he was not sure if he should reveal results from experiments that had not been completed and did not think the programme would be hostile toward genetically modified food. He estimated that the experiments were 99 percent complete when the interview was conducted.&lt;ref name="Memorandum"&gt;{{cite web|title=Minutes Of Evidence Taken Before The Science And Technology Committee|date=8 March 1999|url=http://ucbiotech.org/issues_pgl/ARTICLES/Pusztai/Pusztai%20-%20Memorandum%20submitted%20by%20Dr%20Arpad%20Pusztai%20before%20the%20%20Science%20and%20Technology%20Comittee%20of%20the%20UK%20Parliament%20%288.3.1999%29.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that the rats in his experiments suffered stunted growth and had suppressed immune systems and that more safety research was required.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Enserink | first1 = M. | title = Science in Society: Institute Copes with Genetic Hot Potato | doi = 10.1126/science.281.5380.1124b | journal = Science | volume = 281 | issue = 5380 | pages = 1124b | year = 1998 | pmid =  9735026| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said, "If you gave me the choice now, I wouldn't eat it"&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; and it was "very, very unfair to use our fellow citizens as guinea pigs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=February 12, 1999|title=Sci/TechFears erupt over genetic food|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/278354.stm|newspaper=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reaction ==
''World in Action'' issued a press release the day before the broadcast,&lt;ref name="Rowell"&gt;{{Cite book |last= Rowell |first= Andrew |title= Don't worry, it's safe to eat: the true story of GM food, BSE, &amp; Foot and Mouth |publisher= Earthscan |year=2003 |isbn= 1-85383-932-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; stimulating numerous phone calls to Pusztai and the Institute from government, industrial, non-governmental and media organisations. James says he was dismayed that unpublished data had been released and withdrew Pusztai from any further media commitments that morning.&lt;ref name="Memorandum" /&gt; He eventually suspended Pusztai, used misconduct procedures to seize his data, banned him from speaking publicly and did not renew his annual contract.&lt;ref name="Randerson2" /&gt;

Confusion reigned over just what experiments had been conducted. Pusztai had mentioned two lines of genetically modified potatoes, meaning the two GNA lines, and this was reported by the media. The Rowett institute mistakenly assumed the media was talking about a second line transformed with [[concanavalin A]] (ConA), a [[Canavalia|Jack Bean]] lectin that is toxic to mammals. Transgenic ConA Potatoes had been developed, but had never been tested.&lt;ref name="Memorandum" /&gt; Two press releases issued by the Rowett Institute on the 10th and 11th praised Pusztai's research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Food scandal: chronology|newspaper=The Guardian|date=12 February 1999|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/feb/12/food.science1|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and supported increased safety tests on [[genetically modified food]].&lt;ref name="Memorandum" /&gt; The press releases also said that the potatoes were modified with ConA, adding to the confusion. Pusztai claimed that he had not seen the press releases before they went out and had no opportunity to correct the mistake. James says that he drafted it and Pusztai rewrote one section, but did not see the final copy.&lt;ref name="Memorandum" /&gt; The mistaken belief that the ConA gene was inserted into the potato led scientist [[Robert May, Baron May of Oxford|Sir Robert May]] and Agricultural Minister [[Jack Cunningham]] to release statements to the media saying that the findings were not surprising, as a known poison had been added to the potato.&lt;ref name="Rowell" /&gt; Some scientists still dismiss Pusztai's work over this error.&lt;ref name="Randerson2" /&gt;

=== Audit ===
The Rowett Institute audited Pusztai's work on  22 October 1998. It concluded that his data did not support his conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rowett.ac.uk/gmo/ajp.htm |title=Report of Project Coordinator on data produced at the Rowett Research Institute (RRI) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907051021/http://www.rowett.ac.uk/gmo/ajp.htm |archivedate=September 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mendel in the kitchen: a scientist's view of genetically modified foods|author1=Nina Vsevolod Fedoroff  |author2=Nancy Marie Brown |lastauthoramp=yes |page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1999, 22 scientists from 13 countries, organised by [[Friends of the Earth]],&lt;ref&gt;Gaskell, George and Bauer, Martin W., editors, "Biotechnology, 1996–2000, the years of controversy", p. 295. The GM food debate, National Museum of Science and Industry, {{ISBN|978-1-900747-43-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; published a memo responding to the audit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/1999/feb/12/food.gm Top researchers back suspended lab whistleblower] The Guardian, 12 February 1999, Retrieved 12 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It stated that their independent examination supported Pusztai's conclusions and that he should have been concerned by his findings.

=== Royal Society peer review ===
On 19 February the [[Royal Society]] publicly announced that a committee would review his work. [[World in Action]] reporters Laurie Flynn  and  Michael Sean Gillard claimed that this was an unusual step, as the Royal Society did not normally conduct peer reviews.&lt;ref name="Lachman" /&gt; The data were sent to six anonymous reviewers&lt;ref name="Randerson2" /&gt; and the resulting review was published in June 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Noreen et al., (1999) [http://www.pages.drexel.edu/~ls39/peer_review/ewen.pdf Review of data on possible toxicity of GM potatoes] The Royal Society, 1 June 1999, Retrieved 28 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It stated that Pusztai's experiments were poorly designed, contained uncertainties in the composition of diets, tested too few rats, used incorrect statistical methods and lacked consistency within experiments. Pusztai responded by saying the reviewers had reviewed only internal Rowett reports, which did not include the design or methodology of the experiments.&lt;ref name="Arpad article" /&gt;

=== Lancet response ===
The editors of ''[[The Lancet]]'' published an editorial in May 1999 in which they denounced all parties involved, criticizing Pusztai for "unwisely" announcing his results on television and stating that scientists should publish "results in the scientific press, not through the popular media"; the editorial also denounced the Royal Society's review as "breathtaking impertinence".&lt;ref&gt;Editors of the Lancet. [http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(99)00093-8/fulltext Health risks of genetically modified foods] The Lancet 353(9167):1811, May 29, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
The data were published as a letter in ''The Lancet'' in October 1999, co-authored by Ewen.&lt;ref name="Lancet"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ewen SW, Pusztai A |title=Effect of diets containing genetically modified potatoes expressing Galanthus nivalis lectin on rat small intestine |journal=Lancet |volume=354 |issue=9187 |pages=1353–4 |date=October 1999 |pmid=10533866 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(98)05860-7 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It reported significant differences in the thickness of the gut [[epithelium]] of rats fed genetically modified potatoes (compared to those fed the control diet), but no differences in growth or immune system function were suggested.

The letter was reviewed by six reviewers – three times the Lancet's usual number. Four reviewers found it acceptable after revisions. A fifth thought it was flawed, but wanted it published "to avoid suspicions of a conspiracy against Pusztai and to give colleagues a chance to see the data for themselves". The sixth, John Pickett of the [[Institute of Arable Crops Research]], also said it was flawed.&lt;ref name="Enserink1999B"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Enserink | first1 = Martin | year = 1999 | title = The Lancet Scolded Over Pusztai Paper | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/286/5440/656a | journal = Science | volume = 286 | issue = 5440| pages = 656a–656 | doi = 10.1126/science.286.5440.656a | pmid=10577214}}&lt;/ref&gt; After consulting with the Royal Society, Pickett publicly criticised ''The Lancet'' for agreeing to publish the study. The study, which used data held by Ewen,&lt;ref name="Enserink1999A"&gt;{{cite journal  | author = Enserink, M. | title = Bioengineering: Preliminary Data Touch Off Genetic Food Fight | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/283/5405/1094  | year = 1999 | journal = Science | pages = 1094–5 | volume = 283 | issue = 5405 | accessdate = 2009-06-26  | pmid = 10075564  | doi = 10.1126/science.283.5405.1094}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was not subject to the veto of Pusztai's work,&lt;ref name="Randerson2" /&gt; reported [[Statistical significance|significant]] differences in thickness of the gut [[epithelium]] between control and test subjects, but did not mention growth or immunity problems.&lt;ref name="Lancet" /&gt;

The published work was criticised on the grounds that the unmodified potatoes were not a fair control diet and that any rats fed only potatoes would suffer from protein deficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Kuiper | first1 = H. A.| last2 = Noteborn | first2 = H. P. M.| last3 = Peijnenburg | first3 = A. A. M.| title = Adequacy of methods for testing the safety of genetically modified foods| journal = Lancet| volume = 354| issue = 9187| pages = 1315–1316| date=October 1999 | pmid = 10533854| doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(99)00341-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pusztai responded to these criticisms by saying that all the experimental diets had the same protein and energy content, and that the food intake of all rats was the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ewen, SWB |author2=A Pusztai |year=1999 |title=GM food debate |journal=The Lancet |volume=354 |issue=9191 |pages=1726–1727 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)76708-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview, Pickett later said that ''Lancet'' editor [[Richard Horton (editor)|Richard Horton]] must have had a political motive for publishing the paper because the referees had rejected it. According to Pusztai this claim was repeated by academic critics who assumed that Pickett's use of the plural suggested that the study had failed peer review.&lt;ref name="Arpad article"/&gt;

Horton claimed that he had received a "very aggressive" phone call calling him "immoral" and threatening that if he published the paper it would "have implications for his personal position" as editor.&lt;ref name="Lachman"/&gt; [[Peter Lachmann]], the former vice-president and biological secretary of the Royal Society and president of the Academy of Medical Sciences, acknowledged making the call but denies that he threatened Horton and says the call was to "discuss his error of judgment" in publishing the letter and to discuss the "moral difficulties about publishing bad science".&lt;ref name="Lachman"&gt;Laurie Flynn and Michael Sean Gillard for The Guardian, October 31, 1999 [https://www.theguardian.com/science/1999/nov/01/gm.food Pro-GM scientist "threatened editor"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
Ewen retired following publication, claiming that his career options had been "blocked at a very high level".&lt;ref name="Rowell" /&gt;

A survey by the [[European Food Safety Authority]] GMO Panel Working Group on Animal Feeding Trials concluded: "Results obtained from testing GM food and feed in rodents indicate that large (at least 100-fold) 'safety' margins exist between animal exposure levels without observed adverse effects and estimated human daily intake. The studies did not show any biologically relevant differences in the parameters tested between control and test animals."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.fct.2008.02.008 | title = Safety and nutritional assessment of GM plants and derived food and feed: The role of animal feeding trials | journal = Food and Chemical Toxicology | volume = 46 | pages = S2–x2 | year = 2008 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 Pusztai was given a [[whistleblower]] award from the [[Federation of German Scientists (VDW)|Federation of German Scientists]].&lt;ref name="Randerson2"/&gt;

The '''2017 Rey de Reyes''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "King of Kings") was a [[professional wrestling]] event produced by the [[Lucha Libre AAA World Wide]], or simply AAA, [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotion]]. The 2017 version was the 21st year in a row that AAA has held a Rey de Reyes show and tournament. Previous Rey de Reyes tournaments consisted of several rounds, but for 2017 AAA held a nine-man [[Royal Rumble]]-style elimination match, which was won by [[Argenis (wrestler)|Argenis]].

The show saw several changes compared to the originally announced matches, including [[Johnny Mundo]], the [[AAA Latin American Champion]] defeating [[AAA Mega Champion]] [[El Texano Jr.]] and [[AAA World Cruiserweight Champion]] [[El Hijo del Fantasma]] to win both championships, making him the first man to hold all three championships. In the main event of the reshuffled card [[Aero Star]] defeated [[Super Fly (wrestler)|Súper Fly]] in a ''[[Lucha de Apuestas]]'', or bet match, forcing Súper Fly to have all his hair shaved off after the match.

==Production==
===Background===
Starting in 1997 and every year since then the Mexican ''[[Lucha Libre]]'', or [[professional wrestling]], [[wrestling promotion|company]] [[Lucha Libre AAA World Wide|AAA]] has held a [[Rey de Reyes]] (Spanish for "King of Kings') show in the spring. The 1997 version was held in February,&lt;ref name="Rey1997"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/rey.html#1997 | title = Asistencia Asesoria y Administracion Rey de Reyes | accessdate = February 19, 2009 | date = February 21, 1997 | publisher = ProWrestlingHistory.com | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090301173345/http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/rey.html#1997 | archive-date = 2009-03-01 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  while all subsequent Rey de Reyes shows were held in March. As part of their annual Rey de Reyes event AAA holds the [[eponym]]ious Rey de Reyes tournament to determine that specific year's ''Rey''.&lt;ref name=YIR1997&gt;{{cite news|title=1997 Especial!|work=Box y Lucha Magazine|pages=2–28|id=issue 2332|date=January 7, 1998|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most years the show hosts both the qualifying round and the final match, but on occasion the qualifying matches have been held prior to the event as part of AAA's weekly television shows.&lt;ref name=Lucha2004&gt;{{cite news|title=Número Especial – Lo mejor de la lucha libre mexicana durante el 2004|work=SuperLuchas|id=Issue 91|date=January 24, 2005|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The traditional format consists of four preliminary rounds, each a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic elimination matches|Four-man elimination match]] with each of the four winners face off in the tournament finals, again under elimination rules.&lt;ref name="Rey1997"/&gt; There have been years where AAA has employed a different format to determine a winner.&lt;ref name=Lucha2004/&gt; The winner of the Rey de Reyes tournament is given a large ornamental sword to symbolize their victory, but is normally not guaranteed any other rewards for winning the tournament, although some years becoming the Rey de Reyes has earned the winner a match for the [[AAA Mega Championship]]. From 1999 through 2009 AAA also held an annual ''[[AAA Reina de Reinas Championship|Reina de Reinas]]'' ("Queen of Queens") tournament, but later turned that into an actual championship that could be defended at any point during the year, abandoning the annual tournament concept.&lt;ref name=Reinas1999&gt;{{Cite book | author=Royal Duncan and Gary Will | title=Wrestling Title Histories | publisher=Archeus Communications |chapter= Mexico: AAA Reina de Reinas | page= 400 | year= 2000 | isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reinas12&gt;{{cite news | author = SuperLuchas staff | title = Lo Mejor de la Lucha Libre Mexicana 2008 | work =SuperLuchas | id = issue 296 | date =  January 6, 2008 | url=http://superluchas.net/?p=11145 | accessdate =  July 11, 2009| language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reinas13&gt;{{cite web | url= http://superluchas.net/2009/09/26/aaa-heroes-inmortales-homenaje-a-antonio-pena-resultados-en-vivo-26-septiembre-2009-%C2%BFque-pasara-con-la-lucha-entre-charly-manson-y-chessman-%C2%BFquien-sera-el-luchador-sorpresa/ | title= AAA- Héroes Inmortales III- (Resultados en vivo 26 septiembre 2009) – Cibernético gana el Trofeo Antonio Peña – Electroshock sustituye a Charly Manson contra Chessman – El luchador sorpresa fue Konan Big | author= Marquina, Alva | date= September 26, 2009 | accessdate= September 27, 2009 | publisher= ''SuperLuchas'' Magazine| language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2017 Rey de Reyes took place at ''Arena José Sulaimán'' in [[Monterrey, Nuevo León]], the fourth time Rey de Reyes was held in Monterrey and the first time it was held at ''Arena José Sulaimán''. The show was the 19th Rey de Reyes show in the series. AAA had originally announced that the 2017 Rey de Reyes tournament would consist of one match, a three-way match between the three reigning AAA singles champions as [[El Texano Jr.]] ([[AAA Mega Championship]]) would face [[El Hijo del Fantasma]] ([[AAA World Cruiserweight Championship]]) and [[Johnny Mundo]] ([[AAA Latin American Championship]]).&lt;ref name=Card&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.luchalibreaaa.com/carteles/cartel-completo-rey-reyes-2017/ | title=     Cartel Completo: Rey de Reyes 2017 | accessdate=March 25, 2017 | publisher=AAA | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Event===
[[File:John Morrison.jpg|thumb|right|[[Johnny Mundo]], who became a triple champion at the Rey de Reyes show.]]
The Rey de Reyes show featured seven [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]] with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing, scripted feuds, plots, and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]] (referred to as ''rudos'' in Mexico, those that portray the "bad guys") or [[Face (professional wrestling)|faces]] (''técnicos'' in Mexico, the "good guy" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

The opening match, a [[steel cage match]] between the team of [[Pagano (wrestler)|Pagano]] / [[El Mesias]] and [[Dark Cuervo]] / [[Dark Scoria]] was originally announced as the fourth match of the night,&lt;ref name=Card/&gt; but was moved to the first instead. Under AAA rules the match could be won by escaping the cage to the floor, usually by climbing over to side to the floor. During the match Curvo climbed over the top to the floor, waiting for his partner to also exit. In the closing moments of the match El Mesias tackled Dark Scoria through the cage, driving both of them to the ground outside the ring, which was ruled as an escape for Dark Scoria. As a result of their victory Dark Cuervo and Dark Scoria earned a match for the [[AAA World Tag Team Championship]] at a future date.&lt;ref name=SLRdR2017/&gt;

[[Mari Apache]] was originally scheduled to be part of the #1 contender for the [[AAA Reina de Reinas Championship]] but was unable to compete due to a skull injury. AAA had announced a ''luchadora sorpresa'' (a "surprise wrestler") that turned out to be Mexican-Japanese [[Ayako Hamada]] who had last worked for AAA in 2008.&lt;ref name=SLRdR2017/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&amp;nr=25&amp;view=&amp;page=4&amp;gimmick=&amp;year=&amp;promotion=122&amp;region=&amp;location=&amp;arena=&amp;showtype=&amp;constellationType=&amp;worker= | title=Ayako Hamada &gt; Matches &gt; Asistencia Asesoría y Administración | work=CageMatch | accessdate= March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Faby Apache]] was the first wrestler eliminated, followed by [[Goya Kong]], La Hiedra and Big Mami. The match came down to Ayako and Lady Shani, with Hamada gaining the final pinfall and thus the right to challenge for the AAA Reina de Reinas Championship later on in the show.&lt;ref name=SLRdR2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Reina&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mediotiempo.com/lucha-libre/2017/03/19/ayako-hamada-la-nueva-reina-de-reinas-de-aaa | title= Ayako Hamada, la nueva Reina de Reinas de AAA| date=March 19, 2017 | accessdate=March 25, 2017 | work=MedioTiempo | publisher=[[MSN]] | language=Spanish | first=Jorge | last=Rosales}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the third match of the show, [[Impact Wrestling]] representative [[Jeff Jarrett]] came to ringside with AAA official Dorian Roldan to announced that the two promotions had reached a working agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mediotiempo.com/lucha-libre/2017/03/23/impact-wrestling-hablo-de-su-acuerdo-con-aaa | title=Impact Wrestling habló de su acuerdo con AAA | date=March 23, 2017 | accessdate=March 26, 2017 | work=MedioTiempo | language=Spanish | publisher=[[MSN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next match, originally scheduled to be the main event of the show, was not only moved down the card, but was no longer for the 2017 Rey de Reyes title. Instead AAA official [[Vampiro]] announced that all three championships would be on the line in the match as [[AAA Mega Champion]] [[El Texano Jr.]] faced off against [[AAA World Cruiserweight Champion]] [[El Hijo del Fantasma]] and [[AAA Latin American Champion]] [[Johnny Mundo]].&lt;ref name=SLRdR2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Triple&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mediotiempo.com/lucha-libre/2017/03/19/johnny-mundo-se-convirtio-en-tricampeon-de-aaa | title=Johnny Mundo se convirtió en tricampeón de AAA | date=March 19, 2017 | accessdate=March 26, 2017 | work=MedioTiempo | publisher=[[MSN]] | language=Spanish | first=Jorge | last=Rosales}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the match El Hijo del Fantasma was able to perform "The Thrill of the Hunt" (one of his signature moves, a [[Professional wrestling throws#Samoan driver|Samoan driver]] onto a steel chair) on Texano Jr. After taking the move El Texano Jr. was attended to by paramedics, to give the impression that the move hurt Texano Jr. so badly that he had to be taken from the ring on a stretcher. Moments later Johnny Mundo was aided by an unidentified man who attacked El Hijo del Fantasma. The attack led to Mundo pinning El Hijo del Fantasma to win the match and become a triple champion.&lt;ref name=SLRdR2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Triple/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://411mania.com/wrestling/aaa-rey-de-reyes-2017-results-mundo-becomes-triple-champion/ | work=411Mania | accessdate=March 28, 2017 | title=AAA Rey De Reyes 2017 Results: Mundo Becomes Triple Champion | first=Larry | last=Csonka | date=March 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next match originally announced as a [[Falls count anywhere match]],&lt;ref name=Card/&gt; but was instead contested under normal [[tag team]] rules. For the match long-time rivals [[Psycho Clown]] and [[Dr. Wagner Jr.]] fought [[Murder Clown]] and [[Monster Clown]], who had turned on both Psycho Clown and Wagner in the months leading up to the match. Psycho Clown and Dr. Wagner Jr. managed to get along well enough to defeat the two traitorous clowns. Moments after the match was over all four wrestlers were attacked by a group consisting of [[Carta Brava Jr.]], [[Mocho Cota Jr.]] and [[Soul Rocker]] who beat up all four competitors and then stole Dr. Wagner Jr.'s [[wrestling mask|mask]].&lt;ref name=SLRdR2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Triple/&gt; The semi-main even match was [[Taya Valkyrie|Taya]]'s third Reina de Reinas championship defense since winning the title in 2014 as she fought Ayako Hamada. Hamada pinned Taya cleaning, becoming the 20th ''Reina de Reinas'' in AAA history.&lt;ref name=SLRdR2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Reina/&gt;

The semi-final match was the previously unannounced Rey de Reyes tournament, a nine-man elimination match, fought under [[Royal Rumble]] rules where a new competitor joined the match at a timed interval and wrestlers were eliminated by being thrown out of the ring. The order of elimination was [[Pimpinela Escarlata]], Niño Hamburguesa, [[El Elegido]], [[Joe Lider]], [[La Parka II|La Parka]], [[Chessman (wrestler)|Chessman]] and [[Súper Nova|Bengala]] leaving [[Argenis (wrestler)|Argenis]] and [[Averno (wrestler)|Averno]] as the last two men. The final elimination happened by pinfall as Argenis pinned Averno to win the Rey de Reyes tournament and the Rey de Reyes sword that symbolizes the victory.&lt;ref name=SLRdR2017/&gt;

In the last match of the night [[Aero Star]] put his mask on the line against long time rival [[Super Fly (wrestler)|Súper Fly]] who would risk his hair in a ''[[Lucha de Apuestas]]'', or "bet match". During the match both wrestlers bled profusely and Aero Star's mask was torn up by Súper Fly. At one point the two wrestlers fought outside the ring, with Aero Star climbing to the second level of the arena, only to leap off the edge onto Súper Fly who was positioned below. At one point Súper Fly used a pair of [[brass knuckles]] to hit Aero Star to get the pinfall and looked like he had won the match. Vampiro made his way to ringside and informed the referee of what had happened and restarted the match. The restart allowed Aero Star to pin his opponent, forcing Súper Fly to kneel in the middle of the ring and have all his hair shaved off as per the ''Lucha de Apuestas'' stipulation.&lt;ref name=SLRdR2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Apuesta&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mediotiempo.com/lucha-libre/2017/03/19/aerostar-le-corto-la-cabellera-a-super-fly | title= Aerostar le cortó la cabellera a Súper Fly | last=Rosales | first=Jorge | date= March 19, 2017 | accessdate= March 20, 2017 | work=MedioTiempo | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3559">A '''Round Table''' was a festive event during the Middle Ages that involved [[jousting]], feasting, and dancing in imitation of [[King Arthur]]'s legendary court. Named for Arthur's famed [[Round Table]], the festivals generally involved jousts with blunted weapons, and often celebrated weddings or victories. In some cases participants dressed in the costume of such well-known knights as [[Lancelot]], [[Tristan]], and [[Palamedes (Arthurian legend)|Palamedes]]. The first recorded instance of this activity was in 1223, when the Crusader lord of [[Beirut]] held one in [[Cyprus]] to celebrate the knighting of his eldest sons.

==Round Tables in England==
[[Image:Winchester - Table ronde du roi Arthur.JPG|thumb|200px|The "Winchester Round Table", 13th century]]
[[Edward I of England|Edward I]] held one on the occasion of his marriage, and one in 1284 to celebrate his conquest of [[Wales]]; and is recorded as sponsoring several as late as 1304. One artefact that has survived from this fashion in England is the "[[Winchester Round Table]]" in the Great Hall at [[Winchester Castle]]. The timber of this table has been dated by [[dendrochronology]] to 1275, during Edward's reign,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/history/timeteam/archive/2000arthur.html Channel 4 – Time Team&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; though a royal provenance is not proven so far. The present "Winchester Round Table" was painted in 1522 by order of King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. The places at the table are divided up with alternating green and white panels with the name of Arthurian knights written in gold. However it is King Henry VIII's portrait that is painted at King Arthur's place, and the [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] red rose that adorns the table's centre. 

[[Edward III of England|Edward III]] held a tournament and feast at [[Windsor Castle|Windsor]] in 1344 and built a huge round structure to house it. The details of its use are obscure.  However, it is believed that he intended to found an order of knighthood named after the Round Table and modelled on the fellowship of King Arthur; in the event, in 1348, the order he established was named after the [[Order of the Garter|Garter]].&lt;ref&gt;Julian Munby, Richard Barber and Richard Brown (2006).

Note also the review of this book in the ''Times Literary Supplement'' by Michael Prestwich in an article entitled ''A different circle'' 29 June 2007 page 29&lt;/ref&gt;

==Round Tables elsewhere in Europe==
Round Tables were an aristocratic activity throughout Europe from the 13th until the 15th centuries. They are recorded in [[France]] from 1235 to 1332. In [[Aragon]] they were held as early as 1269 in [[Valencia (province)|Valencia]] and as late as 1291 in [[Catalonia]]. According to [[Roger Sherman Loomis]], "Popes and prelates thundered against these costly, dangerous, and sometimes licentious frivolities, and denied Christian burial to those who took part." Even the middle classes were caught up in this spectacle. In 1281, a burgher of [[Magdeburg]] announced a Round Table in that town. Another was set up by the burghers of [[Tournai]] in 1330. [[Rene d'Anjou]] went so far as to construct a castle for his 1446 Round Table.&lt;ref&gt;[[Norris J. Lacy|Lacy, Norris J.]] (1991). "Round Tables". In [[Norris J. Lacy|Lacy, Norris J.]] (Ed.), ''The New Arthurian Encyclopedia'', p. 391. New York: Garland. {{ISBN|0-8240-4377-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
=== 1989–2000: Creation and first generation artists ===
After graduating from [[California State University, Northridge]] in the United States, [[Lee Soo-man]] returned to Korea and in 1989 established what was then known as "SM Studio" in the [[Apgujeong-dong|Apgujeong]] neighborhood of [[Gangnam District|Gangnam]], [[Seoul]]. In February 1995, the company changed its name to SM Entertainment and set up its capital fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Social Media Management: Value Chain and Business Models in Changing Media Markets|last1=Friedrichsen|last2=Mühl-Benninghaus|first1=Mike|first2=Wolfgang|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year=2013|isbn=978-3-642-28896-8|location=Berlin|page=553}}&lt;/ref&gt; SM then developed an in-house production system and created a string of successful artists, including boy band [[H.O.T.]] in 1996, girl group [[S.E.S. (group)|S.E.S.]] in 1997, boy band [[Shinhwa]] in 1998, R&amp;B duo [[Fly to the Sky]] in 1999, and soloist [[BoA]] in 2000.

Jung Hae-ik was appointed [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] at the time of SM Entertainment's official reestablishment in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.daum.net/entertain/newsview?newsid=20130620093605651|title=소년공화국 "이름 때문에 북한 아이돌 아니냐더라"|website=Daum 연예|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and was succeeded by Kim Kyung-wook in 1998.

=== 2000–2005: Affiliations and second generation artists ===
The early 2000s saw the disbandment of both H.O.T (in 2001) and S.E.S (in 2002).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.donga.com/3/all/20151111/74708087/1|title=SM Black History|last=|first=|date=2015-11-11|work=news.donga.com|access-date=2018-05-11|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shinhwa departed to a new agency, and new acts like the duo [[Isak N Jiyeon]] and the boy band [[Black Beat]] failed to attain the popularity of previous SM artists.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In December 2000, SM established an affiliate company called Fandango Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nocutnews.co.kr/news/157345|title=SM Entertainment merged with Fandango Korea|last=|first=|date=|work=No-Cut News|access-date=2018-05-11|language=ko-KR}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2001, the company founded an overseas division, SM Entertainment Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.etoday.co.kr/news/section/newsview.php?idxno=717254|title=Searching for entertainment industry power ②. SM entertainment|last=|first=|date=2013-04-12|work=이투데이|access-date=2018-05-11|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, the company was approved for listing on [[KOSDAQ]], and SM established an affiliation with the Japanese major label [[Avex Trax]]. SM also formed the subsidiaries BM Entertainment and Cid. K Entertainment (under which the girl groups [[M.I.L.K.]] and [[Shinvi]] were signed, respectively), but they later dissolved when their groups disbanded.

In late 2002, SM was awarded the Grand Prix of Ministry of Culture and Tourism for the Culture Contents for Export Award in music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://people.incruit.com/column/columnview.asp?bdno=100&amp;colno=386929|title=Lee Soo-man SM Group Leader - Leader of popular culture industry moving entertainment industry|last=|first=|date=|website=people.incruit.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, SM became affiliated with Starlight Corporation Ltd. and C-Cube Entertainment Corporation. That same year, the company debuted five-member boy group [[TVXQ]]. The following years saw the debuts of artists such as [[TRAX (band)|TRAX]] (2004), [[The Grace (band)|The Grace]] (2005), and [[Super Junior]] (2005).

=== 2005–2010: Expansion and international artists ===
In 2005, Kim Young-min became the company's third CEO,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/culture/2016/03/386_192565.html|title=After 20 years, SM Entertainment to expand overseas base|date=2015-12-07|website=koreatimes|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; under whom several artists debuted with a view to promoting outside of South Korea. Artists produced by SM during this period included Chinese-born soloist [[Zhang Liyin]] (2006), Japanese-language soloist [[J-Min]] (2007), [[Girls' Generation]] (2007), [[Shinee]] (2008), and [[F(x) (band)|f(x)]] (2009). In April 2008, SM debuted a Mandarin-language sub-unit of Super Junior, named [[Super Junior-M]]. In October 2008, SM announced plans for BoA’s debut in the American market, under a newly formed subsidiary label named SM Entertainment USA.

In May 2008, the SM Art Company opened under co-CEO Pyo In-bong, with a focus on producing theatrical works. The company’s first venture was a production of the American musical comedy [[Xanadu (musical)|''Xanadu'']], starring Super Junior members [[Heechul]] and [[Kangin]].&lt;ref&gt;Koh Young-aah [http://www.koreaherald.com/national/Detail.jsp?newsMLId=20080530000048 "Super Junior members set to make move into musicals"] ''Korea Herald''. 30 May 2008.

In February 2010, after two decades on SM Entertainment’s board of directors, founder Lee Soo-man resigned from his position in order to "focus more energy on SM's overseas business, new business management, and artist development.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.asiae.co.kr/news/view.htm?idxno=2010022514424957673|title=Lee Soo-man steps down from SM board of directors|last=Kun-ouc|first=Park|date=25 February 2010|newspaper=10 Asia|accessdate=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March of the same year, [[KMP Holdings]] was established as a joint venture between SM Entertainment, [[YG Entertainment]], [[JYP Entertainment]], [[Star Empire Entertainment|Star Empire]], Medialine, CAN Entertainment, and Music Factory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.mk.co.kr/newsRead.php?sc=30000019&amp;cm=%EC%A6%9D%EA%B6%8C%20%EC%A3%BC%EC%9A%94%EA%B8%B0%EC%82%AC&amp;year=2010&amp;no=138710&amp;selFlag=&amp;relatedcode=&amp;wonNo=&amp;sID=502 "Korean Music Power: KMP Holdings Co.

In April 2011, SM Entertainment, YG Entertainment, JYP Entertainment, KeyEast, AMENT, and Star J Entertainment came together to form United Asia Management, a joint investment agency geared towards advancing Asian music worldwide.

*{{note label|Shinhwa|2||In 2003, SM Entertainment's five-year contract with Shinhwa ended, allowing the band to either sign another contract or switch labels. Lee Soo-man, the head of SM Entertainment, only wanted to re-sign five of the group’s six members. [[Eric Mun]], as the group’s leader, made the decision that they wanted to stick together with all six members. Thus, the band rejected the offer and switched over to [[Good Entertainment]], which had been founded that same year.

In late July 2009, three of the five original members of SM Entertainment boy group [[TVXQ]] – [[Kim Jaejoong]], [[Park Yoochun]], and [[Kim Junsu]] – applied to the Seoul Central District Court to investigate the validity of their contract with SM,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/special/2009/08/178_49459.html|title=TVXQ Feuds With SM Entertainment|date=2009-08-02|work=The Korea Times|accessdate=3 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://world.kbs.co.kr/english/entertainment/enter_chart_detail.htm?No=10167 |title=Is TVXQ Headed for Breakup? |date=2009-08-03 |work=KBS World |accessdate=3 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105210213/http://world.kbs.co.kr/english/entertainment/enter_chart_detail.htm?No=10167 |archivedate=5 January 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as they felt the thirteen-year contract was excessively long and that earnings were not fairly distributed to the members,&lt;ref name="lawsuit2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/special/2009/08/178_49540.html|title=TVXQ to Stick Together Despite Legal Dispute|date=2009-08-03|work=The Korea Times|accessdate=3 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but contract destruction, they shall be compensated to the Employer by three times the total investment amount and two times the ordinary profit during the remaining contract period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2009/08/04/2009080401107.html|title=TVXQ is a 'slave contract' ...

Retrieved 3 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, 120,000 fans of TVXQ filed a petition against SM's long-term contracts to the Seoul Central District Court, and also filed for compensation for an SMTown Live Concert that was canceled a week before its scheduled date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://world.kbs.co.kr/english/entertainment/enter_chart_detail.htm?No=10351 |title=TVXQ Fan Club Files for Compensation for Cancelled Concert |date=2009-09-03 |work=KBS World |accessdate=3 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101030203834/http://world.kbs.co.kr/english/entertainment/enter_chart_detail.htm?No=10351 |archivedate=30 October 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their statement read, "(They) have had health problems and finally reached their physical limits, but SM Entertainment continued to send them abroad and plan excessive activities. Thus, the three members have started to hope they will be able to continue their careers as they wish, instead of being used as tools for the agency's profits."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sang-hee|first1=Han|title=TVXQ to Stick Together Despite Legal Dispute|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/special/2009/08/178_49540.html|website=The Korea Times|publisher=The Korea Times Co.|accessdate=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The court ruled in the favour of the three ex-members. In response, SM held a press conference claiming that the lawsuit was fraudulent, and filed an injunction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://world.kbs.co.kr/english/entertainment/enter_chart_detail.htm?No=10760|title=SM Entertainment Calls the TVXQ Suit a Big Fraud|date=2009-11-02|work=KBS World|accessdate=2 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2011/02/18/2011021801086.html|title=JYJ Win Legal Battle with Former Management|date=18 February 2011|work=Chosun Ilbo|accessdate=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early May 2010, it was announced that Jaejoong, Yoochun, and Junsu would return to the stage as [[JYJ]] under a new management agency, [[C-JeS Entertainment]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://kr.news.yahoo.com/service/news/shellview.htm?articleid=2010052010224117308&amp;linkid=4&amp;newssetid=1352 "시아준수 등 동방신기 3인, 새 그룹 이름은 J.Y.J?"] ''Yahoo News''. 20 May 2010.

On November 28, 2012, during a voluntary arbitration at the Seoul Central District Court, SM Entertainment and JYJ reached a mutual agreement to terminate all contracts between the two parties and not to interfere with each other's activities in the future, concluding the lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2963083|title=JYJ and SM finally reach agreement|last=Sunwoo|first=Carla|date=29 November 2012|newspaper=Joongang Daily|accessdate=5 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130111053417/http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2963083|archivedate=11 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; SM reportedly stated that they had decided to end the litigation "to avoid bringing additional harm to U-Know Yunho and Max Changmin, who are active as TVXQ, and to avoid making any more unneeded issues."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://enewsworld.mnet.com/enews/contents.asp?idx=22343|title=SM and JYJ Put an End to Their Long, Winding Legal Suit|date=28 November 2012|newspaper=enewsWorld|agency=CJ E&amp;M|accessdate=5 December 2012|author=Park, HyunMin|author2=Erika Kim}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.asiae.co.kr/news/view.htm?idxno=2012112813495846832|title=JYJ, SM Come to Agreement Regarding Exclusive Contract Issue|last=Lee|first=Tae Ho|date=28 November 2012|newspaper=10 Asia|accessdate=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Han Geng ====
On December 21, 2009, five months after the three former TVXQ members filed their lawsuit and while the dispute was still active, [[Han Geng]], the only Chinese member of [[Super Junior]], also filed a lawsuit against SM. Han Geng filed for similar reasons: unfair profit distribution, and an unfair thirteen-year contract that contained provisions in SM's favor that he was not allowed to revise or end.&lt;ref&gt;[http://star.mt.co.kr/view/stview.php?no=2009122215270135930&amp;type=1&amp;outlink=1 "한경 "SM, 非정상적 활동강요"] ''Star News''. 22 December 2009. Retrieved 2012-05-01 {{ko icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artist's friend and later manager Sun Le also submitted a statement to the Korean courts citing SM Entertainment's violation of Han Geng's rights, which was later leaked via the internet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://community.livejournal.com/geng_bao/76937.html#cutid1 "Exclusive Interview with Han Geng’s Team"] (In Chinese with English Translation) ''Beijing Youth Weekly Magazine'' 25 August 2010. Retrieved 1 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The statement argued that SM had discriminated against Han Geng financially as well as in terms of management.

On September 27, 2011, Han Geng's departure from Super Junior was made official when legal representatives of both Han Geng and SM released a joint statement saying that "Han Geng and SM Entertainment have amicably settled on a mutual agreement, and the lawsuit was able to come to a close after Han Geng submitted his 'Notice of Withdrawal of Appeal.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=106&amp;oid=382&amp;aid=0000011661|title=SM Entertainment's official position: Han Geng has "come to a mutual agreement, and will terminate proceedings"|date=September 2011|publisher=news.naver.com|accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://10.asiae.co.kr/Articles/new_view.htm?a_id=2011092711070333667 |title=Han Geng's official position: "SM Entertainment has amicably agreed" |date=September 2011 |publisher=10asia.co.kr |accessdate=10 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017220337/http://10.asiae.co.kr/Articles/new_view.htm?a_id=2011092711070333667 |archivedate=17 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Kris Wu ====
On May 15, 2014, [[Kris Wu]], a Chinese-Canadian member of [[Exo (band)|EXO]], filed a lawsuit to terminate his contract with SM, as first reported by Chinese news portal Sina.&lt;ref name="ent.sina.com.cn2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ent.sina.com.cn/y/k/2014-05-15/09314141917.shtml|title=EXO-M队长吴亦凡提出解约 SM再陷解约门|work=sina.com.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20140515000936|title=EXO-M’s Kris sues SM to end exclusive contract|author=The Korea Herald|work=koreaherald.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was represented by Cho Bum-suk, the same lawyer that handled [[Han Geng]]'s case. Kris, whose real name is Wu Yifan, was quoted as saying, "The company has treated me like a machine part or as an object of control rather than presenting a vision as an entertainer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Phillip |title=SM Entertainment’s lawsuit history over ‘unfair contracts’ |url=http://www.hellokpop.com/news/sm-entertainments-lawsuit-history-over-unfair-contracts/ |website=HelloKpop |publisher=hellokpop.com |accessdate=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left the group in the same month that the lawsuit was made public, while the rest of the group continued to promote their single "Overdose." On July 21, 2016, Kris officially parted ways with EXO, although his contract with SM remains valid until 2022.&lt;ref name="LuKrisConclu"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alexander|first1=Kevin|title=Kris And Luhan's Contract Lawsuit Against SM Entertainment Ends|url=http://www.kpopstarz.com/articles/273224/20160722/sm-entertainment-lawsuit-kris-luhan-sue-end-conclusion-negotiation-contract.htm|website=KPOPStarz|accessdate=23 July 2016|date=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Jessica Jung ====
On September 29, 2014, [[Girls' Generation]] member [[Jessica Jung|Jessica]] claimed in a [[Sina Weibo|Weibo]] post that she had been forced out of the group, writing:&lt;blockquote&gt;''I was excited about our upcoming fan events only to shockingly be informed by my company and 8 others that as of today, I'm no longer a member. I'm devastated - my priority and love is to serve as a member of GG, but for no justifiable reason, I am being forced out''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weibo.com/3547642417/Bpknsn8y8 Jessica's Weibo update on September 30, 2014] weibo.com (September 30, 2014). Retrieved 30 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The following day, Jessica released a statement claiming that in August 2014 her fellow group members and SM had been positive about the launch of her fashion business, Blanc and Eclare. As of early September, she claimed, they had all changed their stance, and she was directed to either close the business or cease promotions as a member of Girls' Generation. She claimed to have received the day before a "one-sided notice" asking her to leave the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hankookilbo.com/v/1e23e60b787c4ff4b3f63162baa02eff|title=Jessica's exits Girl's Generation|last=|first=|date=2014-09-30|work=한국일보|access-date=2018-05-11|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, according to SM, Jessica had unilaterally informed them in early spring that she would leave the group after one more album. But before agreements could be made, she had set up her independent business, which caused problems for the group's professional schedules. This prompted management to begin promoting Girls' Generation as eight members rather than nine, with the intention of announcing the news; however, Jessica had already "posted her own perspective”. The company then stated that the group would henceforth continue as eight, while they would still manage Jessica's individual schedule.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mwave.interest.me/enewsworld/en/article/77155/sm-makes-official-statement-on-jessica SM States that SNSD will Promote as Eight Without Jessica] CJ E&amp;M enewsWorld (September 30, 2014).

On August 6, 2015, Jessica and SM Entertainment reached an agreement to terminate her contract, with Jessica stating, "This release is to confirm that SM Entertainment ('SM') and I have officially parted ways. I will cherish the many years we spent and I wish SM the best of luck in all of its endeavors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=kiddy_days|title=Former Girls’ Generation Member Jessica Officially Leaves SM Entertainment|url=https://www.soompi.com/2015/08/05/former-girls-generation-member-jessica-officially-leaves-sm-entertainment/|website=Soompi|publisher=Viki Inc.|accessdate=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Lu Han ====
On October 10, 2014, [[Luhan (singer)|Lu Han]] became the second Chinese member of [[Exo (band)|EXO]] to file to nullify his contract with SM Entertainment and leave the group, just over four months after Kris had done the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvreport.co.kr/?c=news&amp;m=newsview&amp;idx=581895|title=엑소 루한, SM엔터테인먼트에 소송…크리스 뒤 잇나|website=TV리포트|language=ko-KR|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mydaily.co.kr/new_yk/html/read.php?newsid=201410101029561131&amp;ext=na|title=엑소 루한, SM에 전속계약 해지소송…크리스와 같은 행보|website=www.mydaily.co.kr|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsen.com/news_view.php?uid=201410101325541210|title=SM "루한 갑작스런 소송 당혹, 배후세력 의심된다" 공식입장|website=www.newsen.com|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; His lawsuit included the claim that SM had favored the Korean sub-unit EXO-K over the Chinese sub-unit EXO-M.

==== Huang Zitao ====
On August 24, 2015, [[Tao (entertainer)|Tao]] became the third Chinese member of [[Exo (band)|EXO]] to file against SM and leave the group, being represented by the same legal team that represented former members Kris and Lu Han. On January 5, 2016, SM won one of its counter-lawsuits against Tao per the ruling of the Intermediate People's Court in Qingdao, China. The agency sued Tao over his failure to repay the company after his departure. They released an official statement saying, "SM has ongoing lawsuits against EXO members Wu Yifan (Kris), Luhan, and Tao for violating their exclusive contracts and partaking in illegal promotions in China. Among these lawsuits, SM filed a lawsuit against Tao for failing to repay SM on October 13, 2015. An intermediate court in Qingdao, China made the verdict that Tao is to repay SM Entertainment as well as interest for the delayed payment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.in/sm-entertainment-wins-lawsuit-against-tao-former-exo-member-responds-662117|title=SM Entertainment Wins Lawsuit Against Tao|publisher=International Business Times|accessdate=2016-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=416&amp;aid=0000174747|title=SM, 엑소 전 멤버 타오 상대 부당행위 소송 승소|publisher=Naver|accessdate=2016-06-19|language=ko=KR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2009 MAMA Awards boycott ===
On November 21, 2009, SM Entertainment boycotted the [[Mnet Asian Music Awards]] event, claiming reservations regarding the standard of fairness and the criteria used in [[Mnet (TV channel)|Mnet]]'s selections for award recipients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/art/2009/11/201_55925.html |title=Music Awards Has Fresh Yet Disappointing Start |last=Han Sang |first=Hee |date=November 22, 2009 |publisher=''Korea Times'' |accessdate=13 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091125163015/http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/art/2009/11/201_55925.html |archivedate=25 November 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company specifically mentioned [[Girls' Generation]], who had topped Korean music charts for nine consecutive weeks and had won numerous awards for their single "[[Tell Me Your Wish (Genie) (song)|Genie]]", but had never won on Mnet's weekly [[M! Countdown]] show, and had only appeared on their charts a month after the album release. SM also cited the fact that voters had to pay a fee, saying that they "did not want to see fans suffer any damage from the poll, which has commercial intentions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.asiae.co.kr/news/view.htm?idxno=2009110321401713544|title=SM singers boycott Mnet music award|last=Kim|first=Jessica|date=3 November 2009|newspaper=Asiae|accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fair Trade Commission scrutiny ===
In 2010, the [[Fair Trade Commission (South Korea)|Korea Fair Trade Commission]] (KFTC) undertook an investigation into SM Entertainment's policies, especially regarding artists' contract terms, and concluded that they were unfair. Artist contracts were subsequently reduced by a length of three years, and there was a reduction in the penalties for breach-of-contract violations. All the artists signed under SM at the time re-contracted with the agency under the new terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.mk.co.kr/newsRead.php?no=713677&amp;year=2010|title=FTC, SM modified the contract of exclusive contract `recognition`|last=|first=|date=|work=mk.co.kr|access-date=2018-05-11|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SM was also one of fifteen companies sued and fined by the KFTC for [[Fair Trade Commission (South Korea)#2011 music price fixing scandal.5B1.5D|price rigging in 2011]].

In 2012, SM was accused of colluding with music distributors, but was cleared of the charge. On August 16, the Seoul High Court revealed their verdict on the issue: "The KFTC has canceled all corrective orders against SM Entertainment, and the lawsuit costs will be paid by the defendant."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.hankooki.com/lpage/music/201208/sp2012081614244995510.htm|title=SM엔터'음원유통 담합' 오명 벗어|date=16 August 2012|newspaper=Sports Hankooki|language=Korean|trans-title=SM Entertainment cleared of accusations of colluding with music distributors|accessdate=6 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Red Velvet music video controversy ===
In August 2014, after the release of [[Red Velvet (band)|Red Velvet]]'s music video for "[[Happiness (Red Velvet song)|Happiness]]", Japanese media reported that images referencing the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as well as the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attacks]], were seen in the background of the video. SM Entertainment responded to the reports, stating that "after questioning the director, we found that he simply used a collage source for the images, and there was no intention behind it." The representative added, "As SM wasn't able to catch it before, we will remove the material that caused the misunderstanding as soon as possible. We will make sure not to let this kind of thing happen in the future." SM later uploaded a new version of the music video without the controversial images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mnetamerica.com/news/article/72424/redvelvet-releases-mv-again|title=[Video] Red Velvet Re-Releases ‘Happiness’ MV with Edited Scenes|website=www.mnetamerica.com|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shakespeare in the Arb''' is an annual event, presented in the open, in [[Nichols Arboretum]]. Nichols Arboretum is a 123-acre (49.7 hectares) heavily wooded park, with large landscape lawns surrounded by the woods, a river, and steep hills. The plays are moving events, with both performers and audience moving from location to location within the park as the play progresses. At each location a segment of the play is performed. The plays begin in the early evening, and are put on near the [[summer solstice]] as no artificial lighting is used.

The park is near to the [[University of Michigan]], and downtown [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]] [[Michigan]].

== History ==
Shakespeare in the Arb was founded in 2001 by Inger Schultz, and Kate Mendeloff. Mendeloff has been the artistic director since its inception.&lt;ref name=blog&gt;http://mbgna.blogspot.com/2015/04/shakespeare-in-arb-fifteen-years-of.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performances==
[[File:MI AnnArbor ShakespeareintheArb.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[The Tempest]]'' being performed in 2007|alt=Performance of The Tempest]]
Each year one play is presented. Most years, three weeks (Thurs-Sun) of performances are given.&lt;ref name=lsa&gt;https://www.lsa.umich.edu/mbg/happening/shakespeare_spring.asp&lt;/ref&gt; They all begin fours hours before sunset,&lt;ref&gt;http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/RS_OneYear.php&lt;/ref&gt; at 6:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;ref name=lsa/&gt; local time ([[Time in the United States|EDT]]). Each performance takes about 2.5 hours.&lt;ref name=lsa/&gt; The production travels from spot to spot within the arboretum to create the different scenes.&lt;ref name=mlive/&gt; "As one critic commented, 'The actors used the vastness of its Arb[oretum] stage to full advantage, making entrances from behind trees, appearing over rises and vanishing into the woods.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lsa.umich.edu/rc/currentstudents/shakespeareinthearb |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160229163910/http://www.lsa.umich.edu/rc/currentstudents/shakespeareinthearb |archivedate=2016-02-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arboretum is a public park, situated in the center of an urban area, next to a railroad track, and a large medical center. Thus performances can be interrupted by trains, [[Medical evacuation|medevac]] helicopters, and other park visitors.&lt;ref name=blog/&gt; The weather is a factor, with large rainstorms always possible.&lt;ref name=blog/&gt;

==Reception==
Since the beginning of its second season, Shakespeare in the Arb, has sold out nearly every performance.&lt;ref name=blog/&gt; Tickets are sold on the day of the performances, and are first-come, first-served.&lt;ref name=mlive&gt;http://www.mlive.com/entertainment/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2015/06/5_things_to_do_around_ann_arbo_124.html&lt;/ref&gt; The line for tickets begins forming two hours before the box office opens, as "Shakespeare in the Arb is a hugely popular local summer tradition." &lt;ref name=mlive/&gt;

==A Midsummer Night's Dream==
A particular favorite is A Midsummer Night's Dream.&lt;ref name=blog/&gt; The play—with its natural setting, structure, and language—is perfect for presenting in the arboretum,&lt;ref name=blog/&gt; which features dense heavy woods with mature trees, large lawns, steep hills, and a river. In 2015, [[A Midsummer Night's Dream]] was presented for the third time since the festival began.&lt;ref name=blog/&gt;

[[File:Napoli - Teatro Bellini.jpg|thumb|300px|View of the exterior]]
The '''Teatro Bellini''' (Bellini Theatre) is a private theatre and opera stage located in the centre of [[Naples]] on the Via Vincenzo Bellini at the corner of Via Conte di Ruo. It is across the street from the Academy of Fine Arts of Naples.

The house is named after the Sicilian-born composer, [[Vincenzo Bellini]], who is best known for his [[opera]]s and who spent his some time in the 1820s studying music in the city. In addition, there in an opera house name after him—the [[Teatro Massimo Bellini]]—in [[Catania]], [[Sicily]], his birthplace.

==History==
In 1864, Baron [[Nicola Lacapra Sabelli]] commissioned the theatre's creation from the architect [[Carlo Sorgente]] for the Via Vincenzo Bellini. This theatre, located near Piazza Dante Alighieri, burned down in 1869, and a new one was inaugurated a few hundred feet from the original locale. 
[[File:Regale, Teatro Bellini Napoli.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Interior of theater as it looks today]]
On 6 February 1877 it presented Bellini's opera, ''[[I puritani]]''. The theatre has 6 tiers of box seats surrounding an oval floor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9N3TAAAAMAAJ ''Napoli nobilissima'', Volumes 13-15, page 106.]&lt;/ref&gt; The interior decorations were created by [[Giovanni Ponticelli]], [[Pasquale Di Criscito]], and Vincenzo Paliotti, and the oil portrait of the opera composer was by [[Vincenzo Migliaro]].

For nearly a century, the theatre presented operas and operettas, but by the 1960s it had become dilapidated, used only as a cheap movie theatre, and it was considered for demolition. In 1962 the Bellini hosted its final operatic spectacle with ''[[Masaniello]]'' before being acquired in 1986 by a group led by local artist and producer, [[Tato Russo]]. They restored the house for operatic and theatrical productions which are now frequently presented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teatrobellini.it/la-storia  Teatro Bellini's history] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140320071807/http://www.teatrobellini.it/la-storia |date=20 March 2014 }} on teatrobellini.it&lt;/ref&gt;

It was opened on July 30, 1793 by [[Maria I of Portugal|Queen Maria I]] &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cm-lisboa.pt/equipamentos/equipamento/info/teatro-nacional-de-sao-carlos|title=Sítio da Câmara Municipal de Lisboa: Teatro Nacional de São Carlos|last=|first=|date=|website=www.cm-lisboa.pt|language=pt|archive-url=http://www.cm-lisboa.pt/equipamentos/equipamento/info/teatro-nacional-de-sao-carlos|archive-date=2018-08-02|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;as a replacement for the [[Tejo Opera House]], which was destroyed in the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]]. The theatre is located in the historical center of Lisbon, in the [[Chiado|Chiado district]].

== History ==
In 1792, a group of Lisbon businessmen decided to finance the construction of a new Opera House in the city. The theatre was built in only six months following a design by Portuguese architect [[José da Costa e Silva]], with [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] and [[rococo]] elements. The general project is clearly inspired by great Italian theatres like the [[Teatro di San Carlo|San Carlo]] of [[Naples]] (interior) and [[La Scala]] in [[Milan]] (interior and façade).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.patrimoniocultural.gov.pt/pt/patrimonio/patrimonio-imovel/pesquisa-do-patrimonio/classificado-ou-em-vias-de-classificacao/geral/view/71093|title=National Theater of São Carlos|last=|first=|date=|website=www.patrimoniocultural.gov.pt|language=pt|archive-url=http://www.patrimoniocultural.gov.pt/pt/patrimonio/patrimonio-imovel/pesquisa-do-patrimonio/classificado-ou-em-vias-de-classificacao/geral/view/71093|archive-date=2018-08-02|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In the early 19th century, when the Portuguese Royal Court had to [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|flee]] to the Portuguese [[Colonial Brazil|colony of Brazil]] to escape the invading [[Invasion of Portugal (1807)|Napoleonic troops]], a theatre modelled on the São Carlos was built in [[Rio de Janeiro]].{{Cn|date=April 2014}}

The theatre was erected  honor of the [[Charlotte of Spain|Princess Charlotte of Spain]], who had come to Portugal in 1790 to marry the future King, [[John VI of Portugal|Prince John]]: Carlos (Portuguese form of Charles) is the masculine form of Charlotte. A [[Latin]] commemorative inscription dedicates the theatre to the princess.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The first opera presented here, in 1793, was ''La Ballerina Amante'', by [[Domenico Cimarosa]]. The most famous Portuguese composer of the time, [[Marcos Portugal]], became musical director of the São Carlos in 1800 after returning from Italy, and many of his operas were staged here.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cvc.instituto-camoes.pt/teatro-em-portugal-espacos/teatro-nacional-de-sao-carlos-63547.html#.W2LeKdIzaUk|title=Teatro Nacional de São Carlos - Teatro em Portugal - Espaços - Centro Virtual Camões - Camões IP|last=Azevedo|first=Eunice|date=|website=cvc.instituto-camoes.pt|language=pt-pt|archive-url=http://cvc.instituto-camoes.pt/teatro-em-portugal-espacos/teatro-nacional-de-sao-carlos-63547.html#.W2LeKdIzaUk|archive-date=2018-08-02|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1828 and 1834, the São Carlos was closed during the [[Portuguese Civil War]], fought between kings [[Miguel I of Portugal|Miguel I]] and [[Pedro IV of Portugal|Pedro IV]]. In 1850, the lighting of the interior was changed to [[Gas lighting|gas illumination]], the latest technology available.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Shortly afterwards, the Portuguese state bought the theatre from [[Investment|private investors]]. After a few failed attempts, [[Stage lighting|electrical illumination]] was installed in 1887. From 1935 to 1940, the theatre was closed for repairs.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.monumentos.gov.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=3103|title=National Theater of São Carlos|last=|first=|date=|website=www.monumentos.gov.pt|language=pt|archive-url=http://www.monumentos.gov.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=3103|archive-date=2018-08-02|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, a resident opera company was established. In 1993, the [[Orquestra Sinfónica Portuguesa]] was created as the Teatro's affiliate orchestra, with [[Álvaro Cassuto]] as the orchestra's first principal conductor. Subsequent principal conductors of the Orquestra Sinfónica Portuguesa have included José Ramón Encinar (1999-2001), [[Zoltán Peskó]] (2001-2004) and [[Julia Jones (conductor)|Julia Jones]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.publico.pt/Cultura/a-orquestra-sinfonica-portuguesa-tem-uma-enorme-vontade-de-progredir_1383235|title=A Orquestra Sinfónica Portuguesa tem uma enorme vontade de progredir|author=Cristina Fernandes|date=2009-05-27|work=Publico|accessdate=2010-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2008-2011). Since January 2014, the orchestra's principal conductor is [[Joana Carneiro]].

The theatre building was classified as Property of Public Interest in 1928 and has been reclassified as a National Monument since 1996.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Architecture ==
[[Image:The royal box (12490000563).jpg|left|thumb|250px|Interior of the Teatro.]]
Longitudinal and composite building with articulated parts has a sober facade. The frontispiece is divided into 3 parts: 2 floors on [[mezzanine]] and a third floor on the central body. This central body is torn by a [[portico]] (entrance hall), and has a loggia at the ground level composed of 3 frontal arches and a lateral, in perfect round. The loggia is crowned by a perfect terrace of balustrade in stonework. Here, the windows are framed by parastase, that supports a highlighted cornice. They also have a crown composed of panels with inscription and two high reliefs. At the level of the third floor, this same central body presents a clock surrounded by garlands and two windows, all of which is surmounted by two pinnacles and the Portuguese [[coats-of-arms]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;[[Image:TeatroSCarlos-IPPAR.jpg|right|thumb|273x273px|Main façade of the Teatro.]]At the level of the first floor, the two side bodies have two straight-polished doors crowned by low windows. Although with the same two windows, at the second floor level they feature balustrade in stonework, protruding cornice and a small window in the mezzanine area.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

The main room (performance hall) is elliptic, has five tiers of boxes&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and seats 1148 people.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} The luxurious royal box was lavishly decorated by the Italian Giovanni Appianni. The ceiling was painted by Manuel da Costa and the stage by Cirilo Wolkmar Machado.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

{{chinese|pic=Five Dynasties Ten Kingdoms 923 CE.png|title=Ten Kingdoms|t={{linktext|十|國}}|s={{linktext|十|国}}|p=Shí Guó}}
The '''Ten Kingdoms''' was a period in the history of Southern China that followed the fall of the [[Tang dynasty]] in 907. It lasted until the rise of the [[Song dynasty]], which was founded in 960. Nine of the kingdoms were in the South and one small kingdom was in the far North. Many states were ''de facto'' independent long before the Tang Empire dissolved. The last of the Ten Kingdoms, the [[Northern Han]], survived until 979.

Unlike the [[Five Dynasties]] of northern China, which succeeded one other in rapid succession, the regimes of [[South China]] were generally concurrent, each controlling a specific geographical area. Each court was a center of artistic excellence. The period is noted for the vitality of its poetry and for its economic prosperity. Commerce grew so quickly that there was a shortage of metallic currency. This was partly addressed by the creation of bank drafts, or "flying money" (''feiqian''), as well as by certificates of deposit. Wood block printing became common during this period, 500 years before [[Johannes Gutenberg]]'s press.

==Number of kingdoms==
The Ten Kingdoms were:
* [[Wu (Ten Kingdoms)|Wu]] (907–37)
* [[Wuyue]] (907–78)
* [[Min (Ten Kingdoms)|Min]] (909–45)
* [[Chu (Ten Kingdoms)|Chu]] (907–51)
* [[Southern Han]] (917–71)
* [[Former Shu]] (907–25)
* [[Later Shu]] (934–65)
* [[Jingnan]] (924–63)
* [[Southern Tang]] (937–75)
* [[Northern Han]] (951–79).

Only ten are traditionally listed, hence the era's name. Some historians, such as [[Bo Yang]], count eleven, including [[Yan (Five Dynasties)|Yan]] and [[Qi (Five Dynasties)|Qi]] but not the [[Northern Han]], viewing it as simply a continuation of Later Han. This era also led to the founding of the [[Liao dynasty]] in the north.

Other regimes during this period were [[Yan (Five Dynasties)|Yan]], [[Qi (Five Dynasties)|Qi]], [[Zhao (Five Dynasties)|Zhao]], [[Yiwu Jiedushi]], [[Dingnan Jiedushi]], [[Wuping Jiedushi]], [[Qingyuan Jiedushi]], [[Yin (Ten Kingdoms)|Yin]], [[Zhangye|Ganzhou]], [[Dunhuang|Shazhou]], and [[Wuwei, Gansu|Liangzhou]].

===Wu===
{{History of China}}
The Kingdom of [[Wu (Ten Kingdoms)|Wu]] (902–937) was established in modern-day [[Jiangsu]], [[Anhui]], and [[Jiangxi]].  It was founded by [[Yang Xingmi]], who became a [[Tang Dynasty]] military governor in 892. The capital was initially at Guangling (present-day [[Yangzhou]]) and later moved to Jinling (present-day [[Nanjing]]). The kingdom fell in 937 when it was taken from within by the founder of the [[Southern Tang]].

===Wuyue===
The Kingdom of [[Wuyue]] was the longest-lived (907–978) and among the most powerful of the southern states. [[Wuyue]] was known for its learning and culture. It was founded by [[Qian Liu]], who set up his capital at Xifu (modern-day [[Hangzhou]]).  It was based mostly in modern Zhejiang province but also held parts of southern [[Jiangsu]]. [[Qian Liu]] was named the Prince of Yue by the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] emperor in 902; the Prince of Wu was added in 904.  After the fall of the [[Tang Dynasty]] in 907, he declared himself king of [[Wuyue]]. Wuyue survived until the eighteenth year of the [[Song dynasty]], when Qian Shu surrendered to the expanding dynasty.

===Min===
The Kingdom of [[Min (Ten Kingdoms)|Min]] (909–945) was founded by Wang Shenzhi, who named himself the Prince of Min  with its capital at Changle (present-day [[Fuzhou]]).  One of Shenzhi's sons proclaimed the independent state of Yin in the northeast of Min territory.  The [[Southern Tang]] took that territory after the Min asked for help.  Despite declaring loyalty to the neighboring [[Wuyue]], the [[Southern Tang]] finished its conquest of Min in 945.

===Southern Han===
The [[Southern Han]] (917–971) was founded in [[Guangzhou]] (also known as Canton) by [[Liu Yan (Southern Han)|Liu Yan]].  His brother, [[Liu Yin (Southern Han)|Liu Yin]], was named regional governor by the Tang court.  The kingdom included [[Guangdong]], [[Guangxi]], [[Hanoi]], and [[Hainan]].

===Chu===
The [[Chu (Ten Kingdoms)|Chu]] (927–951) was founded by [[Ma Yin]] with the capital at [[Changsha]].  The kingdom held Hunan and northeastern [[Guangxi]].  Ma was named regional military governor by the Tang court in 896, and named himself the Prince of Chu with the fall of the Tang in 907.  This status as the Prince of Chu was confirmed by the [[Later Tang]] in 927.  The [[Southern Tang]] absorbed the state in 951 and moved the royal family to its capital in [[Nanjing]], although Southern Tang rule of the region was temporary, as the next year former Chu military officers under the leadership of [[Liu Yan (Ten Kingdoms)|Liu Yan]] seized the territory.  In the waning years of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, the region was ruled by [[Zhou Xingfeng]].

===Northern Han===
The [[Northern Han]] was founded by Liu Min (劉旻), formerly known as Liu Chong (劉崇), and lasted from 951 to 979.
It has the capital at [[Taiyuan]].

===Jingnan (also known as Nanping)===
The smallest of the southern states, [[Jingnan]] (924–963), was founded by [[Gao Jichang]].  It was based in Jiangling and held two other districts southwest of present-day [[Wuhan]] in [[Hubei]].  Gao was in the service of the [[Later Liang (Five Dynasties)|Later Liang]] (the successor of the Tang in North China). Gao's successors claimed the title of King of Nanping after the fall of the Later Liang in 924.  It was a small and weak kingdom, and thus tried to maintain good relations with each of the Five Dynasties.  The kingdom fell to advancing armies of the Song in 963.

===Former Shu===
[[Former Shu]] (907–25) was founded after the fall of the Tang Dynasty by Wang Jian, who held his court in [[Chengdu]].  The kingdom held most of present-day [[Sichuan]], western [[Hubei]], and parts of southern [[Gansu]] and [[Shaanxi]].  Wang was named military governor of western Sichuan by the Tang court in 891.  The kingdom fell when his son surrendered in the face of an advance by the [[Later Tang]] in 925.

===Later Shu===
The [[Later Shu]] (935–965) is essentially a resurrection of the previous Shu state that had fallen a decade earlier to the [[Later Tang]].  Because the Later Tang was in decline, Meng Zhixiang found the opportunity to reassert Shu's independence.  Like the Former Shu, the capital was at Chengdu and it basically controlled the same territory as its predecessor.  The kingdom was ruled well until forced to succumb to Song armies in 965.

===Southern Tang===
{{main|Southern Tang}}
[[Image:Zhou Wenju's A Literary Garden.jpg|thumb|''A Literary Garden'', by [[Zhou Wenju]], [[Southern Tang]].]]

The [[Southern Tang]] (937–975) was the successor state of [[Wu (Ten Kingdoms)|Wu]] as [[Emperor Liezu of Southern Tang|Li Bian]] (Emperor Liezu) took the state over from within in 937.  Expanding from the original domains of [[Wu (Ten Kingdoms)|Wu]], it eventually took over Yin, Min, and Chu, holding present-day southern Anhui, southern Jiangsu, much of Jiangxi, Hunan, and eastern Hubei at its height.  The kingdom became nominally subordinate to the expanding Song in 961 and was invaded outright in 975, when it was formally absorbed into Song China.

===Transitions between kingdoms===
Although more stable than northern China as a whole, southern China was also torn apart by warfare. [[Wu (Ten Kingdoms)|Wu]] quarrelled with its neighbours, a trend that continued as Wu was replaced with [[Southern Tang]]. In the 940s [[Min (Ten Kingdoms)|Min]] and [[Chu (Ten Kingdoms)|Chu]] underwent internal crises which Southern Tang handily took advantage of, destroying Min in 945 and Chu in 951. Remnants of Min and Chu, however, survived in the form of [[Qingyuan Jiedushi]] and [[Wuping Jiedushi]] for many years after. With this, Southern Tang became the undisputedly most powerful regime in southern China. However, it was unable to defeat incursions by the [[Later Zhou]] between 956 and 958, and ceded all of its land north of the [[Yangtze River]].

The Song dynasty, established in 960, was determined to reunify China. [[Jingnan]] and [[Wuping Jiedushi]] were swept away in 963, [[Later Shu]] in 965, [[Southern Han]] in 971, and [[Southern Tang]] in 975. Finally, Wuyue and [[Qingyuan Jiedushi]] gave up their land to Northern Song in 978, bringing all of southern China under the control of the central government.

In common with other periods of fragmentation, the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period resulted in a division between [[northern and southern China]]. The greater stability of the Ten Kingdoms, especially the longevity of Wu Yue and Southern Han, would contribute to the development of distinct regional identities within China.

'''''The Fall of Robespierre''''' is a three-act play written by [[Robert Southey]] and [[Samuel Coleridge]] in 1794. It follows the events in France after the downfall of [[Maximilien Robespierre]]. Robespierre is portrayed as a [[tyrant]], but Southey's contributions praise him as a destroyer of [[despotism]]. The play does not operate as an effective drama for the stage, but rather as a sort of dramatic poem with each act being a different scene. According to Coleridge, "my sole aim to imitate the impassioned and highly figurative language of the French Orators and develop the characters of the chief actors on a vast stage of horrors."&lt;ref name = "hen"/&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Execution robespierre, saint just....jpg|right|thumb|The execution of Robespierre. Note: the beheaded man is not Robespierre, but Couthon: Robespierre is shown sitting on the cart closest to the scaffold, holding a handkerchief to his mouth.]]
To raise money, Southey and Coleridge began to work together in August 1794. According to Southey the project began in "sportive conversation" at the house of their friend [[Robert Lovell]]. The three intended to collaborate on a play that would deal with the beheading of Robespierre in July 1794. Their source was news articles that described the final moments of a dispute within the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]]. During composition, they were able to write 800 lines in just two days. The play was divided between the three collaborators, with Coleridge composing the first act, Southey composing the second act and Lovell the third. Southey and Lovell completed their acts but Coleridge had only finished part of his the following evening. Southey felt that Lowell's contribution was not "in keeping" and so rewrote the third act himself. Coleridge completed his act. When they turned to [[Joseph Cottle]] to publish the work, he refused and Coleridge had to search for another publisher. He took the manuscript to Cambridge, revising and improving his own contribution.&lt;ref name = "hen"&gt;Henry Nelson Coleridge, ''The Literary Remains of Samuel Taylor Coleridge'', London, Pickering, 1836, pp. 2–3&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the work was published in October 1794 by [[Benjamin Flower]]. Five hundred copies were printed and circulated in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], [[Cambridge]], and London, which brought the writers fame while their personal relationship grew tense.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 1989 pp. 73–78&lt;/ref&gt;

The events that inspired the work involve Robespierre's taking over of the National Assembly and removing the moderate members. During this time, he also allowed the executions of many individuals and became the center of power during the summer of 1793. The next summer, 28 July 1794, he was executed by guillotine along with 21 others.&lt;ref name="Ashton p. 51"&gt;Ashton 1997 p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

==Play==
[[File:Robespierre.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of Robespierre]]
The play is filled with various speeches on the topic of liberty. The first scene is set in the [[Tuileries]], in which [[Bertrand Barère]], [[Jean-Lambert Tallien]] and [[Louis Legendre]], opponents of Robespierre discuss their plans to challenge the "tyrant". Their conversation comprises highly rhetorical speeches as if they were part of a public meeting.&lt;ref&gt;Ashton 1997 pp. 51–52&lt;/ref&gt;
:The peaceful virtues
:And every blandishment of private life,
:The father's cares, the mother's fond endearment,
:All sacrificed to liberty's wild riot.

The third act, originally written by Lovell, was rewritten by Southey. Within the act, the opponents of Robespierre compare themselves to the assassins of [[Julius Caesar]] who are restoring the republic. In the final speech, Bertrand Barère discusses the history French Revolution and lists the various would-be despots who have attempted to usurp liberty for [[Louis XVI]] to Robespierre himself, concluding that France will be a beacon of liberation to the world.&lt;ref&gt;Speck 2006 pp. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt;
:Never, never,
:Shall this regenerated country wear
:The despot yoke. Though myriads round assail
:And with worse fury urge this new crusade
:Than savages have known; though all the leagued despots
:Depopulate all Europe, so to pour
:The accumulated mass upon our coasts,
:Sublime amidst the storm shall France arise
:And like the rock amid surrounding waves
:Repel the rushing ocean. —  She shall wield
:The thunder-bolt of vengeance – She shall blast
:The despot's pride, and liberate the world.

==Themes==
Act one reflects Coleridge's feelings about those Robespierre executed, including Madame Roland and Brissot. The tone of the piece is not revolutionary, but it does include themes connected to his other works and reveals Coleridge's thoughts on marriage, politics, and childhood. It also incorporates Coleridge's view that individuals are naturally innocent in a manner similar to Rousseau's belief. This idea, combined with a belief in achieving some sort of paradise, was developed in the works following the play.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 1989 p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

The play as a whole deals with many [[Shakespearean]] themes and emphasises the precedents of both [[Brutus]] and [[Mark Antony]] throughout.&lt;ref name="Ashton p. 51"/&gt; Southey's third act captures his feelings on the French Revolution and incorporates his radical views. The act also contains his feelings on despotism and liberty.&lt;ref&gt;Speck 2006 p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical response==
An anonymous review in the November 1794 ''[[The Critical Review|Critical Review]]'' argued that the subject matter would have been appropriate for a tragedy but the events happened too soon to allow for it to be dealt with in an appropriate manner. The reviewer also commented on the haste of the work and that it "must, therefore, not be supposed to smell very strongly of the lamp.&lt;ref name="Madden p. 37"&gt;Madden 1972 qtd. p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; However, the review does praise aspects of the poem, as the author writes, "By these free remarks, we mean not to under-rate Mr. Coleridge's historical drama. It affords ample testimony, that the writer is a genuine votary of the Muse, and several parts of it will afford much pleasure to those who can relish the beauties of poetry. Indeed a writer who could produce so much beauty in so little time, must possess powers that are capable of raising him to a distinguished place among the English poets."&lt;ref name="Madden p. 37"/&gt; In the ''British Critic'', an anonymous reviewer argued in 1795 that "The sentiments&amp;nbsp;... in many instances are naturally, though boldly conceived, and expressed in language, which gives us reason to think the Author might, after some probation, become no unsuccessful wooer of the tragic muse."&lt;ref&gt;Madden 1972 qtd. p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

300px|Bible verse appearing on Trijicon ACOG TA01-NSN]] [[File:Trijicon rifle scope with Bible verse.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Trijicon]] [[telescopic sight]] with reference to 1 John 1:7, "But if we walk in the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, His Son, purifies us from all sin."]]The '''Trijicon biblical verses controversy''', known by the [[sobriquet]]  '''Jesus rifles''', refers to the stamping of [[Chapters and verses of the Bible|Bible verse]] references (e.g. ''Rev21:23'') onto [[telescopic sight]]s for rifles manufactured by [[Trijicon]], which bear religious inscriptions. Users and purchasers of the equipment– which included the [[United States Army]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] and military units around the world– were unaware of the inscriptions. Upon discovery of the practice in 2010, controversy erupted across religious and political spectra regarding inappropriate and sacrilegious aspects.

== ABC News report ==

On 18 January 2010, [[ABC News]] reported Trijicon was placing references to verses in the [[Bible]] in the serial numbers of sights sold to the [[United States Armed Forces]].&lt;ref name=abcnews&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/us-military-weapons-inscribed-secret-jesus-bible-codes/story?id=9575794 |title=U.S. Military Weapons Inscribed With Secret 'Jesus' Bible Codes | publisher = ABC News |accessdate=2010-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The book chapter:verse cites were appended to the model designation, see photo.) The ABC News story was initiated by [[Michael L. Weinstein]] and the [[Military Religious Freedom Foundation]], after being alerted to the practice by multiple sources including [[active duty]] servicemembers.&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/22/us/22guns.html |title=Firm to Remove Bible References From Gun Sights | publisher = New York Times | date = 2010-01-22|accessdate=2010-03-11 | first=Erik | last=Eckholm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tom Munson, director of sales and marketing for Trijicon, said the practice of including the references was started in 1981 by the company's founder, devout Christian Glyn Bindon, who died in a 2003 plane crash.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8468981.stm |title=Gunsights' biblical references concern US and UK forces |publisher=BBC News |date=2010-01-20 |accessdate=2010-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responses ==

Some Christian organizations spoke out against the practice.&lt;ref name="bapt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bjconline.org/truly-disturbing-updatedx2/|title=Truly Disturbing|last=Byrd|first=Don|date=2010-01-18|work=Church and State| publisher=[[Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty]] |accessdate=2010-01-18|location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interfaithalliance.org/news/345-interfaith-alliance-statement-on-the-placement-of-bible-versus-on-us-military-weapons|title=Statement on The Placement of Bible Verses on U.S. Military Weapons|last=Gaddy|first=Rev.

A spokesman for [[United States Central Command]], which manages military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, opined the inscribed sights do not violate the military's self-imposed ban on [[proselytism|proselytizing]] because there is no effort to distribute the equipment beyond the US troops who use them.
{{quote|"This situation is not unlike the situation with U.S. currency", said the spokesman, Air Force Maj. John Redfield. "Are we going to stop using money because the bills have 'In God We Trust' on them? As long as the sights meet the combat needs of troops, they'll continue to be used".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cbs13.com/national/bible.verses.weapons.2.1435066.html |title=Bible References On Military Scopes Made By Michigan Company Ruffle Feathers |publisher=cbs13.com |date=2010-01-19 |accessdate=2010-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On 20 January 2010 the [[BBC]] reported that the British [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]], which had—when unaware of the issue—recently purchased 480 Trijicon sights for use in Afghanistan, appreciated that the markings could cause offense, and had taken the matter up with the company.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

As news of the inscriptions surfaced, further armed forces became aware of controversial practice. The [[New Zealand Special Air Service]] had purchased 260 of the scopes in 2004 and at the time was also unaware of the practice. The New Zealand SAS confirmed they will not stop using the sights as they are considered the best in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10621500&amp;pnum=2 |title=NZ soldiers in Afghanistan to keep using 'Jesus scopes' | page = 2 | work = National |publisher = NZ Herald News |accessdate=2010-03-02 |date=2010-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; A New Zealand defence force spokesman was quoted as saying "We deem them to be inappropriate", and the NZ Prime Minister, [[John Key]] said the government was not aware of the inscriptions when the equipment was purchased, and "We are in discussions with the company in the United States who will ensure the inscriptions are removed, and we wouldn't want them on future sights".&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, Wellington reported in South China Morning Post 22-10-09&lt;/ref&gt;

== End of practice for government contracts ==

On 22 January 2010, Trijicon announced it would stop the practice of engraving Biblical references on products sold to the government. It also offered to provide modification kits for the purpose of removing such engravings on sights already produced and sold to the military. In a statement, the company said it was both "prudent and appropriate" to remove the engravings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8474268.stm|title=US firm to remove Biblical references on guns|date=22 January 2010|accessdate=22 January 2010 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trijicon's consumer products are still engraved with Biblical references in accordance with company tradition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trijicon.com/faq.cfm#f54 Trijicon, Inc.

'''Uli Jon Roth''' (born '''Ulrich Roth''', 18 December 1954) is a [[Germany|German]]
[[guitarist]], who became famous as [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]]' lead guitarist, and is one of the earliest contributors to the [[neoclassical metal]] genre. He is also the founder of [[Sky Academy]] and inventor of the Sky Guitar. He is the older brother of fellow guitarist and artist [[Zeno Roth]] (1956–2018).

==Career==

===Dawn Road and Scorpions===
In the early 1970s, Roth formed a band called Dawn Road. In 1973, guitarist [[Michael Schenker]] left the [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]] to join [[UFO (band)|UFO]]. The two remaining Scorpions members, [[Rudolf Schenker]] and [[Klaus Meine]] merged with the four members of Dawn Road, (Uli Jon Roth, Achim Kirschning, Francis Buchholz, Jürgen Rosenthal) using the name Scorpions as they were more well known than Dawn Road.&lt;ref&gt;Klüsener, Edgar (circa 1990). [http://yehao.com/UliJonRoth/Images/Scorps/metalattack3.jpg Scorpions - Sting of Change]. Metal Attack Magazine. Scanned page 3/7. Archived at Uli Jon Roth fansite.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- see Talk--&gt;

During his tenure as lead guitarist, main songwriter and occasional lead singer for the Scorpions, the band released four studio albums between 1974 and 1977. In 1978, the Scorpions released the live album ''[[Tokyo Tapes (album)|Tokyo Tapes]]'', which was recorded in Japan and sold nearly one million copies and went gold in several countries. However, Roth had left the band in 1978 following the end of the ''[[Taken by Force]]'' tour and before the ''Tokyo Tapes'' release.

===Electric Sun===
Roth formed his own band named [[Electric Sun]], which released three albums. The first, ''[[Earthquake (album)|Earthquake]]'' (1979), was dedicated to the spirit of Jimi Hendrix. A second album released two years later, ''[[Fire Wind]]'' (1981), was dedicated to [[Anwar Sadat]] (the assassinated President of Egypt who had tried to make peace in the Middle East), and featured a song called "Enola Gay (Hiroshima Today?)" about the atomic bombing of Japan by [[Enola Gay| an airplane of that name]].

In 1985, Roth released his third and final Electric Sun album, ''[[Beyond the Astral Skies]]'', dedicated to [[Martin Luther King]] and to Roth's fans.

=== Solo career ===
After Electric Sun, Roth entered a new phase of creative work, composing four symphonies and two concertos, and sometimes performing with symphony orchestras throughout Europe. Roth used the name "Uli Jon Roth" for all subsequent album releases and concert appearances.

The [[G3 (tour)|G3]] European tour of 1998 featured Roth playing with [[Joe Satriani]] and [[Michael Schenker]]. The tour show at London Wembley Arena also featured a jam with [[Brian May]].

Roth played at the outdoor rock festival at [[Castle Donington]] in 2001 (also featuring original Scorpions lead guitarist [[Michael Schenker]] on the bill), and this was filmed and subsequently released on DVD.

Roth appeared in concert with the Scorpions onstage at the [[Wacken Open Air]] Festival in 2006 along with two other former members of the band. Billed as "A Night To Remember, A Journey Through Time", the Scorpions played four songs from the Roth era, most of which they hadn’t played live since Roth had left in 1978. The concert was filmed and released on DVD.&lt;ref&gt;Angulo, Steve (April 9, 2009). [http://hardrockheavymetal.wordpress.com/2009/04/09/scorpions-live-at-wacken-open-air-2006-dvd-2007/ Scorpions – Live At Wacken Open Air 2006 DVD (2007)] (Review). Hard Rock Heavy Metal blog.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- this blog entry may be harmless. Discuss.--&gt;

Although this was meant to be a "one night only" special event, its success meant that the format was repeated on several tours afterwards.

On 2 June 2007 at the [[Rock am Ring|Rock am Ring festival]] in Germany, Roth joined [[The Smashing Pumpkins]] on stage for their epic closing song "Gossamer". He made another appearance with the Pumpkins upon their return to Germany on 26 February 2008.

In 2007, Roth had begun working on a new full-length studio album, which was to be released the following year. The title of the album would be "Under A Dark Sky" and was going to be the first official release in the long-awaited series of Symphonic Legends – a cycle of music written by Uli for his all-encompassing Sky of Avalon project.

Roth debuted songs from "Under A Dark Sky" on 18 July 2008 in his headline set at the [[G-TARanaki Guitar Festival]] in New Zealand, Roth's debut concert in the country. In the week previous Roth had taken his "Sky Academy" tuition classes to regional [[Taranaki Region|Taranaki]] towns in [[Waitara, New Zealand|Waitara]], [[Inglewood, New Zealand|Inglewood]] and [[Opunake]] with guests [[Vernon Reid]] and [[Gilby Clarke]].

"Under A Dark Sky" was released in Japan on 20 August 2008 via Marquee records. The European and USA releases followed a month later on 20 September 2008 on the SPV record label.

In early 2015, Uli Jon Roth released a 2-CD studio album entitled ''[[Scorpions Revisited]]'' recorded in 2014 in [[Hannover]], Germany, in which Roth revisited his personal favourites from the early [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]] period. This CD was highly successful and led to a world tour by Uli with a full electric rock band. Following the success of this tour, Uli then led a tour called The Ultimate Guitar Experience with fellow guitarists Jennifer Batten and Andy Timmons. This tour was met by critical acclaim. Seemingly without much rest, Uli soon thereafter embarked on another world tour, this time playing ''The Tokyo Tapes'', songs from the Scorpions 1978 tour of Japan and ensuing live album. In December 2016, a double CD and Blu-ray/DVD were released of a concert Uli and his band played in Japan in 2015 commemorating the anniversary of ''The Tokyo Tapes''. In March, 2017, Roth concluded a short, but very successful North American tour, highlighting songs from both ''Scorpions Revisted'' and ''Tokyo Tapes''.

==Sky guitars==
In the 1980s, Roth commissioned construction of custom guitars with additional frets from [[luthier]] Andreas Demetriou. Roth has had five of these "Sky" guitars made. To be able to emulate the high notes of a violin, all of the Sky Guitars contain extra frets. The first Sky Guitar (used on the album ''Beyond the Astral Skies'') has 30 frets. Later versions of the Sky Guitar overcame the problem of the higher register frets becoming too narrow by widening the frets by whole steps for the highest notes. In an April 2001 ''[[Guitar Player]]'' magazine interview, Roth reports that the guitars are either fretless above the 30th fret or have whole step fret spacing above the 27th fret, with 35 effective (half step) frets. All of the Sky guitars with frets have scalloped fretboards. The Sky guitar's pickups are custom 4-coil [[humbucker]]s made by John Oram, with one guitar having an Oram pickup hidden under the 24th fret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edenwaith.com/uliroth/music/skyguitar.php |title=Sky Guitar |accessdate=9 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;September 2000 issue of Young Guitar magazine&lt;/ref&gt; For a time, Roth used a Framus Dragon amplifier, although currently he promotes Blackstar Artisan 100 &amp; Series One 200 Watt heads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blackstaramps.com/artists/quotes.php?page=1&amp;id=211|title=Blackstar Amps Uli Jon Roth Quote |accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also used a stalk mounted Vibesware guitar resonator (sustainer) to introduce infinite sustain as on the instrumental Benediction on his ''Under A Dark Sky'' album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vibesware.com/vibesware_english.htm |title=Vibesware Guitar Feedback Playing |accessdate=9 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, [[Dean Guitars]] produced 25 Custom Sky Guitars based on Roth's custom models, with six and seven strings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deanguitars.com/ulijonroth.php |title=ULI JON ROTH SERIES|accessdate=9 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Playing style==
{{unreferenced section| date= August 2017}}

In Roth's early days with Scorpions, his soloing style was based primarily on the blues scale, occasionally incorporating notes from other modes. However, by the time the band recorded the ''[[Virgin Killer]]'' album, he began incorporating more advanced compositional elements from European classical music, such as pedal tone sequences and intricate arpeggios. Beginning with Electric Sun, the classical influence began to dominate his playing style, notable in songs like "Cast Away Your Chains" and "Still So Many Lives Away". His style eventually became a fusion of blues-based rock with European classical sensibilities. Roth employs major and minor pentatonic, the blues scale, phrygian, harmonic minor, diminished, and the whole tone scale, notably in his famous "Sails Of Charon" solo.

==Personal life==
Roth was romantically involved with artist [[Monika Dannemann]] who was with Jimi Hendrix when he died. Roth and Danneman collaborated on various songs including "We'll Burn the Sky" from the Scorpions' ''[[Taken by Force]]'' album in 1977.

Danneman also painted the album sleeves for all three of the releases by Electric Sun.

In 1996 Monika Dannemann was convicted of breaking a British High Court order not to repeat allegations that [[Kathy Etchingham]] was an "inveterate liar" for accusing her of playing a role in Jimi Hendrix's death. Etchingham asked the judge to jail Dannemann but she was released. Two days later Monika Dannemann was found dead in a fume-filled [[Mercedes-Benz]] near her cottage in [[Seaford, East Sussex|Seaford]], [[East Sussex]], aged 50. Her death was ruled a [[suicide]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/a-rock-legend-unto-herself-1345098.html |title=A rock legend unto herself |last=Braid |first=Mary |publisher=The Independent |date=May 1, 1996 |accessdate=July 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Roth publicly stated his opinion that her death had been the result of foul play. Roth dedicated later works to the memory of Dannemann.

Roth has been living in the UK for several years, his [[Llansilin#Notable_residents|current home]] (2015) being in [[Powys]], Wales, near the border of [[Shropshire]], England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Uli gives pupils a rock masterclass|work=Shropshire Star|date=14 July 2015|page=14}}Report by Harry Leather. Describes visit to hold a musical masterclass to eight pupils at St Martins School, Shropshire.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''VentureBeat''' is an American technology website headquartered in [[San Francisco]], California, United States. It publishes news, analysis, long-form features, interviews, and videos.

==History==

The VentureBeat company was founded in 2006 by Matt Marshall, an ex-correspondent for ''[[The Mercury News]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Company Overview of VentureBeat, Inc.|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=45090315&amp;privcapId=42726499&amp;previousCapId=42726499&amp;previousTitle=VentureBeat,%20Inc.|website=Bloomberg L.P.|accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009, VentureBeat signed a partnership agreement with IDG to produce [[DEMO Conference]], a conference for startups to announce their launches and raise funding from [[venture capitalists]] and [[angel investors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2009/02/18/demo-gets-desperate-shipley-out-marshall-in/|title=VDEMO Gets Desperate: Shipley Out, Marshall In|accessdate=2010-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the partnership with IDG ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Farewell, DEMO.

'''Woodhouse Copse''' is an [[Arts and Crafts style]] house in the village of [[Holmbury St Mary]], [[Surrey]], England. It is a Grade II [[listed building]],&lt;ref name=EHW&gt;{{NHLE |num=1245123 |desc=Woodhouse Copse |accessdate=1 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; known for its gardens, originally planted by garden designer [[Gertrude Jekyll]], and for the [[country house opera]] performed by '''Woodhouse Opera''' at the annual '''Woodhouse Summer Opera Festival'''.

==House==
Built in 1926, the house was designed by architect [[Oliver Hill (architect)|Oliver Hill]] for the stage and film actor [[Amy Brandon Thomas]] and her husband William Deane Barnes-Brand.&lt;ref name=EHW/&gt; In 1939 Hill built another house for the couple, Burrows Wood in [[Gomshall]], Surrey, which is also Grade II listed.&lt;ref name=EHB&gt;{{NHLE |num=1391775 |desc=Burrows Wood |accessdate=1 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Woodhouse Copse is a large [[cottage orné]], originally with a [[thatched roof]],&lt;ref name=EHW/&gt; built in brick with [[weatherboarding]] and a large, central stone chimney. Hill was influenced by [[Edwin Lutyens]] and Gertrude Jekyll in his use of local materials and [[vernacular architecture]].&lt;ref name=VB&gt;{{cite book |title=Regionalism and Modernity: Architecture in Western Europe 1914–1940 |editor1-last=Meganck |editor1-first=Leen |editor2-last=Van Santvoort |editor2-first=Linda |editor3-last=De Maeyer |editor3-first=Jan |chapter=Oliver Hill: A Window on Regionalism in Britain during the Interwar Period |last=Vanden Berghe |first=Vanessa |year=2013 |publisher=Leuven University Press |location=Leuven |isbn=978-90-5867-918-5 |pages=185–187 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his almost sculptural shaping of the thatch was distinctive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Architects of the Arts and Crafts Movement |last=Richardson |first=Margaret |year=1983 |publisher=Trefoil Books |location=London |isbn=0-86294-031-1 |page=139 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He built similar houses elsewhere in the 1920s, including at [[Croyde]], Devon and [[Knowle, West Midlands|Knowle]] in the Midlands. Woodhouse Copse also featured timbers retrieved from an old mill at [[Coulsdon]], as commemorated in a verse engraved in 1925 on a window.&lt;ref name=VB/&gt; The central shaft from the mill was incorporated into a spiral staircase. The house's thatch was later removed.&lt;ref name=EHW/&gt;

==Garden==
Hill laid out the garden with its [[terrace garden|terrace]]s, [[drystone wall]]s and circular steps. Over 1926–28, Jekyll drew up planting plans for the flowerbeds, and supplied the plants from her [[plant nursery|nursery]] at [[Munstead Wood]], Surrey,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Gertrude Jekyll and the Country House Garden |last=Tankard |first=Judith B. |year=2011 |publisher=Aurum Press |location=London |isbn=978-1-84513-624-6 |page=170 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where Amy Brandon Thomas was a frequent visitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Miss Jekyll: Portrait of a Great Gardener |last=Massingham |first=Betty |year=1966 |publisher=[[Country Life (books)|Country Life]] |location=London |page=98 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Woza Albert!''''' is a political satire play that imagines the second coming of [[Christ]] during the [[apartheid]]-era in [[South Africa]].

==Play==
The play opened at [[Johannesburg]]'s [[Market Theatre (Johannesburg)|Market Theater]] and toured in Europe and America as the most successful play to come out of South Africa, winning more than 20 prestigious awards worldwide. In 2003 it was produced by [[Terence Frisby]] at the [[Criterion Theatre]] in [[London]].

''Woza Albert!'' (which means "Come Albert") was written by [[Percy Mtwa]], [[Mbongeni Ngema]], and [[Barney Simon]] in 1981. In 2002, it was performed in London by [[Siyabonga Twala]] and [[Errol Ndotho]].

The two actors play roles of various black South Africans - a vendor, barber, servant, manual labourer, soldier - receiving the news that Christ (Morena) has arrived in South Africa, where a Calvinist white elite imposes apartheid. Christ's arrival precipitates a crisis, and the government launches a nuclear bomb against the peacemaker. In the ruins, great South African leaders in resistance to apartheid such as [[Albert Luthuli]], former president of the [[African National Congress]], are resurrected. They play dozens of parts that involve them using many skills such as acting, mime, singing and dance. They also create images using a few words and actions.

==Film==
A film was made under the same title, following the success of the play. A BBC-TV team, led by [[David M. Thompson]], undertook the filming of the movie while in South Africa to film elections in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/1736826|title=Woza Albert! [videorecording] in SearchWorks catalog|author=|date=|website=searchworks.stanford.edu|accessdate=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equipment was scant, as was time, but nonetheless the film captured the performances that are the core of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.american.edu/subject/media/aufderheide/woza.html|title=Cross cultural film guide|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
