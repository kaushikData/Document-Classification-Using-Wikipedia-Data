'''12AT7''' (also known in Europe by the [[Mullard–Philips tube designation]] of ECC81) is a miniature 9-pin medium-gain (60) dual-[[triode]] [[vacuum tube]] popular in [[guitar amplifier]]s.  It belongs to a large family of dual [[triode]] [[vacuum tubes]] which share the same pinout (EIA 9A), including in particular the very commonly used low-[[Transconductance#Vacuum_tubes|mu]] [[12AU7]] and high-mu [[12AX7]].

The 12AT7 has somewhat lower voltage gain than the 12AX7, but higher [[transconductance]] and plate current, which makes it suitable for high frequency applications.

Originally the tube was intended for operation in [[VHF]] circuits, such as [[TV set]]s and [[FM broadcasting|FM]] tuners, as an [[oscillator]]/frequency converter, but it also found wide use in audio as a driver and phase-inverter in vacuum tube [[push–pull amplifier]] circuits.

This tube is essentially two 6AB4s or two EC92s in a single envelope.

The tube has a center-tapped filament so it can be used in either 6.3V 300mA or 12.6V 150mA heater circuits.

[[Image:EIA-9A.png]]

{{As of|2012}} the 12AT7 was manufactured in Russia ([[Electro-Harmonix]] brand), [[Slovakia]] ([[JJ Electronic]]), and China.

{{Antimatter}}

'''Antihydrogen''' ('''{{Element2|anti=yes|Hydrogen}}''') is the [[antimatter]] counterpart of [[hydrogen]]. Whereas the common [[hydrogen atom]] is composed of an [[electron]] and [[proton]], the antihydrogen atom is made up of a [[positron]] and [[antiproton]].   Scientists hope studying antihydrogen may shed light on the question of why there is more [[matter]] than [[antimatter]] in the observable universe, known as the [[baryon asymmetry]] problem.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-13666892 BBC News – Antimatter atoms are corralled even longer]. Bbc.co.uk. Retrieved on 2011-06-08.&lt;/ref&gt; Antihydrogen is produced artificially in [[particle accelerator]]s. In 1999, [[NASA]] gave a cost estimate of $62.5 trillion per gram of antihydrogen (equivalent to ${{Inflation|USD|62.5|1999}} trillion today), making it the most expensive material to produce.&lt;ref name="NASA1999"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to the extremely low yield per experiment, and high [[opportunity cost]] of using a [[particle accelerator]].

==Experimental history==
Accelerators first detected hot antihydrogen in the 1990s. [[ATHENA]] studied cold {{Element2|Hydrogen|anti = yes}} in 2002.  It was first trapped by the Antihydrogen Laser Physics Apparatus ([[ALPHA Collaboration|ALPHA]]) team at [[CERN]]&lt;ref name=natrev&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/468355a |pmid=21085144 |author=Reich, Eugenie Samuel |title=Antimatter held for questioning |journal=Nature |volume=468 |issue=7322 |pages=355 |year=2010 |bibcode=2010Natur.468..355R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eiroforum.org/activities/scientific_highlights/201112_CERN/index.html eiroforum.org – CERN: Antimatter in the trap] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203230601/http://www.eiroforum.org/activities/scientific_highlights/201112_CERN/index.html |date=February 3, 2014 }}, December 2011, accessed 2012-06-08&lt;/ref&gt; in 2010, who then measured the structure and other important properties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2012/mar/07/internal-structure-of-antihydrogen-probed-for-the-first-time Internal Structure of Antihydrogen probed for the first time]. March 7, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; ALPHA, AEGIS, and GBAR plan to further cool and study {{Element2|Hydrogen|anti = yes}} atoms.

===1S–2S transition measurement===
In 2016, the [[Antiproton Decelerator#ALPHA|ALPHA]] experiment measured the [[atomic electron transition]] between the two lowest [[energy level]]s of antihydrogen, 1S–2S. The results, which are identical to that of hydrogen within the experimental resolution, support the idea of matter–antimatter symmetry and [[CPT symmetry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.nature.com/news/ephemeral-antimatter-atoms-pinned-down-in-milestone-laser-test-1.21193|title=Ephemeral antimatter atoms pinned down in milestone laser test|publisher=Nature|date=19 December 2016|accessdate=20 December 2016|author=Castelvecchi,  Davide }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the presence of a magnetic field the 1S–2S transition splits into two [[Hyperfine structure|hyperfine]] transitions with slightly different frequencies. The team calculated the transition frequencies for normal hydrogen under the magnetic field in the confinement volume as:

:f&lt;sub&gt;dd&lt;/sub&gt; =2 466 061 103 064 (2) kHz 
:f&lt;sub&gt;cc&lt;/sub&gt; =2 466 061 707 104 (2) kHz

A single-photon transition between S states is prohibited by quantum [[selection rule]]s, so to elevate ground state positrons to the 2S level, the confinement space was illuminated by a laser tuned to half the calculated transition frequencies, stimulating allowed [[two photon absorption]].

Antihydrogen atoms excited to the 2S state can then evolve in one of several ways:

*They can emit two photons and return directly to the ground state as they were
*They can absorb another photon, which ionizes the atom
*They can emit a single photon and return to the ground state via the 2P state—in this case the positron spin can flip or remain the same.

Both the ionization and spin-flip outcomes cause the atom to escape confinement. The team calculated that, assuming antihydrogen behaves like normal hydrogen, roughly half the antihydrogen atoms would be lost during the resonant frequency exposure, as compared to the no-laser case. With the laser source tuned 200&amp;nbsp;kHz below half the transition frequencies, the calculated loss was essentially the same as for the no-laser case.

The ALPHA team made batches of antihydrogen, held them for 600 seconds and then tapered down the confinement field over 1.5 seconds while counting how many antihydrogen atoms were annihilated. They did this under three different experimental conditions:

*Resonance: – exposing the confined antihydrogen atoms to a laser source tuned to exactly half the transition frequency for 300 seconds for each of the two transitions,
*Off-resonance: – exposing the confined antihydrogen atoms to a laser source tuned 200 kilohertz below the two resonance frequencies for 300 seconds each,
*No-laser: – confining the antihydrogen atoms without any laser illumination.

The two controls, off-resonance and no-laser, were needed to insure that the laser illumination itself was not causing annihilations, perhaps by liberating normal atoms from the confinement vessel surface that could then combine with the antihydrogen.

The team conducted 11 runs of the three cases and found no significant difference between the off-resonance and no laser runs, but a 58% drop in the number of events detected after the resonance runs. They were also able to count annihilation events during the runs and found a higher level during the resonance runs, again with no significant difference between the off-resonance and no laser runs. The results were in good agreement with predictions based on normal hydrogen and can be "interpreted as a test of CPT symmetry at a precision of 200 ppt."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ahmadi|first=M et al|date=19 December 2016|title=Observation of the 1S–2S transition in trapped antihydrogen|journal=Nature|volume=541|issue=7638|pages=506–510|doi=10.1038/nature21040|pmid=28005057|bibcode = 2017Natur.541..506A |url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1537231/1/Guiterrez_nature21040.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
The [[CPT theorem]] of particle physics predicts antihydrogen atoms have many of the characteristics regular hydrogen has; i.e. the same [[mass]], [[magnetic moment]], and atomic state transition frequencies (see ''[[atomic spectroscopy]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://focus.aps.org/story/v26/st1 |title=The Coolest Antiprotons |journal=Physical Review Focus |author=Grossman, Lisa |date=July 2, 2010|volume=26|issue= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, excited antihydrogen atoms are expected to glow the same color as regular hydrogen. Antihydrogen atoms should be [[gravitational interaction of antimatter|attracted to other matter or antimatter gravitationally]] with a force of the same magnitude that ordinary hydrogen atoms experience.&lt;ref name=natrev/&gt; This would not be true if antimatter has negative [[gravitational mass]], which is considered highly unlikely, though not yet empirically disproven (see ''[[gravitational interaction of antimatter]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/view/423901/antihydrogen-trapped-for-1000-seconds|date=May 2, 2011|title=Antihydrogen trapped for a thousand seconds|publisher=Technology Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When antihydrogen comes into contact with ordinary matter, its constituents quickly [[annihilate]]. The positron annihilates with an electron to produce [[gamma ray]]s. The antiproton, on the other hand, is made up of antiquarks that combine with quarks in either neutrons or protons, resulting in high-energy [[pion]]s, that quickly decay into [[muon]]s, [[neutrino]]s, [[positron]]s, and [[electron]]s. If antihydrogen atoms were suspended in a [[Free space|perfect vacuum]], they should survive indefinitely.

As an antielement, it is expected to have exactly the same properties as hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-17284822|title=Antihydrogen undergoes its first-ever measurement|first=Jason|last=Palmer|date=14 March 2012|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, antihydrogen would be a gas under standard conditions and combine with antioxygen to form antiwater, {{Element2|anti=yes|Hydrogen}}{{sub|2}}{{Element2|anti=yes|Oxygen}}.

==Production==
In 1995, the first antihydrogen was produced by a team led by [[Walter Oelert]] at CERN.&lt;ref&gt;

Subsequently, CERN built the [[Antiproton Decelerator]] (AD) to support efforts towards low-energy antihydrogen, for tests of fundamental symmetries.  The AD will supply several CERN groups.  CERN expects their facilities will be capable of producing 10 million antiprotons per minute.&lt;ref name=madsen&gt;{{cite journal

===Low-energy antihydrogen===
Experiments by the [[ATRAP]] and ATHENA collaborations at CERN, brought together positrons and antiprotons in [[Penning trap]]s, resulting in synthesis at a typical rate of 100 antihydrogen atoms per second. Antihydrogen was first produced by ATHENA in 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Production and detection of cold antihydrogen atoms |author=Amoretti, M. |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=419|issue=6906 |year=2002 |pmid=12368849|doi=10.1038/nature01096|bibcode = 2002Natur.419..456A|pages=456–9 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then by ATRAP&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gabrielse, G.|year=2002|title=Driven Production of Cold Antihydrogen and the First Measured Distribution of Antihydrogen States|page=233401|journal=Phys.

The atoms synthesized had a relatively high temperature (a few thousand [[kelvins]]), and would hit the walls of the experimental apparatus as a consequence and annihilate.  Most precision tests require long observation times.

ALPHA, a successor of the ATHENA collaboration, was formed to stably trap antihydrogen.&lt;ref name=madsen/&gt; While electrically neutral, its spin [[magnetic moment]]s interact with an inhomogeneous magnetic field; some atoms will be attracted to a magnetic minimum, created by a combination of mirror and multipole fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1386">'''Atomic energy''' is energy carried by [[atoms]].  The term originated in [[1903 in science|1903]] when [[Ernest Rutherford]] began to speak of the possibility of ''atomic energy''.&lt;ref name="Asimov, Isaac Page 125"&gt;[[Isaac Asimov]],  ''Atom: Journey Across the Sub-Atomic Cosmos'', New York:1992 Plume, {{ISBN|0452268346}}, Page 125&lt;/ref&gt;  The term was popularized by [[H. G. Wells]] in the phrase, "splitting the atom", devised at a time prior to the discovery of the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]].  Atomic energy may include:

*[[Nuclear binding energy]], the energy required to split a nucleus of an atom.
*[[Nuclear potential energy]], the potential energy of the particles inside an atomic nucleus.
*[[Nuclear reaction]], a process in which nuclei or nuclear particles interact, resulting in products different from the initial ones; see also [[nuclear fission]] and [[nuclear fusion]].
*[[Radioactive decay]], the set of various processes by which unstable atomic nuclei (nuclides) emit subatomic particles.
* The energy of inter-atomic or [[chemical bond]]s, which holds atoms together in compounds.

Atomic energy is the source of [[nuclear power]], which uses sustained nuclear fission to generate heat and electricity.

The '''Circum-Superior Belt''' is a widespread [[Paleoproterozoic]] [[large igneous province]] in the [[Canadian Shield]] of [[Northern Canada|Northern]], [[Western Canada|Western]] and [[Eastern Canada]]. It extends more than {{Convert|3400|km|mi|abbr=on}} from northeastern [[Manitoba]] through northwestern [[Ontario]], southern [[Nunavut]] to northern [[Quebec]]. Igneous rocks of the Circum-Superior Belt are [[mafic]]-[[ultramafic rock|ultramafic]] in composition, deposited in the [[Labrador Trough]] near [[Ungava Bay]], the [[Cape Smith Belt]] near the southern shore of [[Hudson Strait]] and along the eastern shore of [[Hudson Bay]] in its northern portion; the [[Thompson Belt|Thompson]] and [[Fox River Belt|Fox River]] belts in the northwest and the [[Marquette Range Supergroup]] in its southern portion.

A number of magmatic features are present in the Circum-Superior Belt, including [[dike (geology)|dikes]], [[sill (geology)|sills]] and volcanics that comprise geologic [[formation (stratigraphy)|formations]]. This geologic belt is considered to be a large igneous province because its magmatic rocks were emplaced over an extremely short [[geological time scale|geological time]] span. Even though the Circum-Superior Belt was emplaced during an extremely short geological time span, the associated magmas were probably derived from a number of separate sources.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt;

Most of the Circum-Superior Belt lies along the margin of the [[Superior Craton]], which is the most extensive fragment of [[Archean]] [[crust (geology)|crust]] on Earth.&lt;ref name="SI"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ca. 1880 Ma Circum-Superior LIP|publisher=Ernst, Richard E.|url=http://www.largeigneousprovinces.org/May.html|accessdate=2010-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, a number of igneous rocks within the Superior craton remain undated, indicating the existence of magmatic rocks with the same age as those of the Circum-Superior Belt is probable.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; It contains two large [[copper]]-[[nickel]] mining districts; the nickel-bearing Thompson Belt at the northwestern portion of the Superior craton and the Cape Smith Belt at the northern portion of the Circum-Superior Belt.

==Geology==

===Formation===
The Circum-Superior Belt was formed 1,884&amp;nbsp;to 1,864&amp;nbsp;million years ago when the Superior craton was surrounded by mountain building processes, including the [[Trans-Hudson orogeny|Trans-Hudson]], New Quebec and [[Penokean orogeny|Penokean]] orogenies.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; The major Trans-Hudson orogeny had its appearance when the Superior craton collided with the [[Rae craton|Rae]]-[[Hearne craton|Hearne]] [[craton (geology)|craton]] 1,900&amp;nbsp;to 1,800&amp;nbsp;million years ago.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; Massive orogenic belts with a change in horizontal direction are represented by the double promontory structure of the Superior craton that seem to have come from the beginning of a [[rift]]ing event.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; The New Quebec orogen, also known as the Labrador Trough, lies at the northeastern portion of the Superior craton and is related to ocean closure and collision with the southeastern portion of the Rae craton.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; At 1,900&amp;nbsp;and 1,800&amp;nbsp;million years ago, an ocean closure and collision with the Wisconian arc terrane resulted in the creation of the Penokean orogeny at the southern Superior craton margin.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; The last collision occurred on the southeastern portion of the Superior craton to produce the [[Grenville orogeny]] 1,100&amp;nbsp;million years ago.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt;

Because most of the Circum-Superior Belt was formed by widespread mafic-ultramafic magmatism 1,884&amp;nbsp;to 1,864&amp;nbsp;million years ago along the Superior craton margin during these orogenies, a number of different suggestions have been made to explain the questionable origins of this large igneous province.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; It is also not clear if the Circum-Superior Belt has a single origin or it has several origins.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; Suggestions include back-arc rifting, foredeep flexure, [[mantle plume]]s and the breakup of a [[microcontinent]].&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; The geochemical indication of the Circum-Superior Belt is also poorly known; either it contains major regional differences or it is the same throughout the magmatic zone.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; With the discovery of the Pickle Crow dike swarm throughout the western Superior craton, the likelihood of other 1,880&amp;nbsp;million year old dike groups throughout the Superior craton remains.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; This is partly because several dike zones in the Superior craton remain undated.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; The relationship of the Circum-Superior Belt with similar age magmatism throughout the nearby Trans-Hudson belt and elsewhere on Earth is also unknown.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; This includes the 1,860&amp;nbsp;million year old magmatism of the East Kimberly event in [[Australia]] and 1,860&amp;nbsp;million year old magmatism of the Mashonaland event in [[Africa]].&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; The other questionable suggestion related to the Circum-Superior Belt is the existence of a suggested 1,900&amp;nbsp;million year old global superplume event.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt;

===Geologic features===

The {{convert|1600|km|mi|abbr=on}} long Labrador Trough, extending from [[Ungava Bay]] through Quebec and Labrador, includes two volcano-sedimentary series, the first ranging from 2,170&amp;nbsp;to 2,140&amp;nbsp;million years old and second ranging from 1,883&amp;nbsp;to 1,870&amp;nbsp;million years old.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; This magmatism is considered to have formed as a result of back-arc volcanism.&lt;ref name="CL"&gt;{{cite web|title=Large Igneous Province in Canada Through Time and Their Metallogenic Potential Appendix 1|work=Mineral Deposits of Canada|publisher=[[Geological Survey of Canada]]|date=2008-09-24|url=http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/mindep/synth_prov/lip/tables/appendix1_e.php|accessdate=2010-01-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604195124/http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/mindep/synth_prov/lip/tables/appendix1_e.php|archivedate=2011-06-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The youngest magmatic series (1883-1870 Ma) contains 1,880&amp;nbsp;million-year-old [[carbonatite]]s and [[lamprophyre]]s.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; 1,883&amp;nbsp;to 1,874&amp;nbsp;million-year-old mafic and a few ultramafic magmas comprise the [[Willbob Formation|Willbob]] and [[Hellancount Formation|Hellancourt]] formations and [[Montagnais sills]].&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; The youngest magmatism of the youngest magmatic series is 1,870&amp;nbsp;million-year-old [[felsic]] and [[carbonatite|carbonatitic]] volcanics.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; These igneous rocks of the Labrador Trough cover an area of {{Convert|30000|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="CL"/&gt;

To the northwest at the northern tip of Quebec near [[Hudson Strait]], the Cape Smith Belt includes the 2,040&amp;nbsp;to 1,970&amp;nbsp;million-year-old Povungnituk volcano-sedimentary group and the 1,880&amp;nbsp;million-year-old [[Chukotat Group]].&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; The {{Convert|5.6|km|mi|abbr=on}} thick Chukotat Group is made of picritic and tholeiitic basalts. These basaltic lavas are intruded by narrow mafic and ultramafic sills.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; At least three different types of lava compositions exist in the Chukotat Group, including olivine phyric, pyroxene-phyric and plagioclase phyric.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; The upper unit of the Chukotat Group is 1,870&amp;nbsp;million years old whereas the lower unit is associated with the Katiniq Suite sills, which cut through the underlying Povungnituk Group.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; In 1989, the Katiniq Suite sills were thought to be 1,918&amp;nbsp;million years old, but more recent dating and a reinterpretation of the original age in 2004 suggests that the Katiniq Suite sills are closer to 1,880&amp;nbsp;million years old.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; Therefore, the age range for the Chutotat Group is 1,880&amp;nbsp;to 1,870&amp;nbsp;million years.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; Volcanism of the Chukotat Group might have originated from rifting of a microcontinent that now forms the southwestern portion of [[Baffin Island]].&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt;

[[File:Circum-Superior Belt age map.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Map showing the age of geologic features related to the Circum-Superior Belt. Geologic features include: 1 = Carbonatite feeder, 2 = Montagnais gabbro sills, 3 = rhyodacite, 4 = Chukotat volcanics, 5 = Belcher and Sleeper Island sills, 6 = Fox River sill, 7 = Molsen dikes, 8 = Thompson belt mafic-untramafic magmatism, 9 = Winnipegosis komatiite, 10 = Hemlock formation, 11 = Gunflint formation, 12 = Pickle Crow dike.]]
On the [[Belcher Islands]] of southern Nunavut, two volcanic groups are known as the Flaherty and Eskimo volcanics.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; The underlying Eskimo volcanics are related with the Richmond Gulf, Persillon, Pachi and Nastapoka Group volcanics.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; The 1,998&amp;nbsp;million-year-old Minto dikes are also interpreted to be related with the Eskimo volcanics.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; The overlying Flaherty volcanics remain undated apart from a lead-lead dating of {{nowrap|1,960 +/- 80 million years}}.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; However, the Flaherty volcanics are suggested to have relationships with the [[Sutton Inlier sills|Sutton Inlier]] and [[Haig sills]].&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; Geochemical indications suggest that the overlying Flaherty volcanics might also have relationships with the Povungnituk volcano-sedimentary group in the Cape Smith Belt, indicating the Flaherty volcanics might be 2,040&amp;nbsp;to 1,960&amp;nbsp;million years old.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; Sills on the Belcher and Snowy islands in Hudson Bay are dated to 1,870&amp;nbsp;million years old, indicating the 1,880&amp;nbsp;million-year-old magmatism also exists in this section of the Circum–Superior large igneous province.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt;

The Fox River Belt in northern Manitoba is composed of sediments, volcanics and sills.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; Fox River Belt sills and [[Molsen dikes]] are 1,883&amp;nbsp;million years old, but the Molsen dikes at the northwestern Superior craton margin intrude an older, 2,090&amp;nbsp;to 2,070&amp;nbsp;million-year-old dike swarm.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; The [[Ospwagan Group]] is younger than {{nowrap| 1974 +/- 50 million years old}} and the 1,864&amp;nbsp;million-year-old [[Winnipegosis komatiite belt]] lies to the southwest.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; Numerous tectonic settings have been suggested for triggering magmatism in the Fox River Belt, including a marginal basin rifting event.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt;

At the southern portion of the Circum-Superior Belt, a group of fragmental sediments composed of iron formation was formed during a period of magmatic activity in the Marquette Range Supergroup.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; Included in the Marquette Range Supergroup is the [[Hemlock Formation]], a [[bimodal volcanism|bimodal volcanic group]] that is estimated to have an age of {{nowrap|1874 +/- 9 million years}}.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; Another volcanic series in the Marquette Range Supergroup, known as the [[Gunflint Formation]], has an age of {{nowrap|1878.3 +/- 1.3 million years}}.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; Further geologic units that are related to the Gunflint Formation include the [[Badwater volcanics]] and the [[Kiernan sills]].&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; A number of origins have suggested for the Marquette Range Supergroup magmatism.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; This includes subsidence being driven ahead related to thrusting of the Penokean orogeny or a possible [[back-arc basin]], and lateral flow through the Pickle Crow dikes transported magma from the Fox River Belt area through the Superior craton for placement in the Marquette Range Supergroup.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; This suggested long-range origin has been suggested for magmatism of the 2,215&amp;nbsp;million-year-old [[Nipissing sills]] as well, which the [[Ungava dike swarm]] could have transported magma to the Nipissing sills area.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt;

Before 2003, all magmatism of the Circum-Superior Belt was thought to only occur along the outer margin of the Superior craton.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; However, the Pickle Crow dike was discovered in 2003 in the interior of the Superior craton and it has since been recognized as a magmatic event related to the Circum-Superior Belt.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; The dike is dated to 1,880&amp;nbsp;million years old and associated dikes are traced for at least {{Convert|400|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; These dikes likely extend over {{Convert|700|km|mi|abbr=on}} across the western portion of the Superior craton from near the Fox River Belt in the north to near [[Lake Superior]] in the south.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; This magmatic crossing creates a relationship with the 1,880&amp;nbsp;million-year-old magmatism in the northwestern portion of the Circum-Superior Belt and magmatism in the Marguette Range Supergroup on the southern portion of the Circum-Superior Belt.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; In addition, the north-northwest trend of the Pickle Crow dikes and the absolute north-northeastern trend of the Molson dike swarm combine to an area north of the northwestern portion of the Circum-Superior Belt.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; This might determine the zone of a mantle plume that was the source for the 1,880&amp;nbsp;million-year-old magmatism in the Circum-Superior Belt.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt;

===Mineralization===
The Circum-Superior Belt is the host for widespread mineral deposits, including copper, nickel and platinum group elements.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; However, the origins of this widespread mineralization is unknown.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; The Thompson Belt in Manitoba is one of the most comprehensive nickel producing zones on Earth.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; It has the potential to contain platinum group elements, but the age of the mafic-ultramafic volcanic rocks comprising the nickel deposits are not well known.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; Since its foundation during the 1950s, numerous mining operations throughout the Thompson Belt have produced over four billion pounds of nickel.&lt;ref name="AS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Thompson Nickel Belt|publisher=[[Crowflight Minerals]]|url=http://www.crowflight.com/s/ThompsonNickel.asp?ReportID=125098%3E|accessdate=2010-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least two nickel deposits are in progress by [[Vale Inco]] at the Thompson and [[Birchtree Mine|Birchtree]] mines.&lt;ref name="AS"/&gt; At least 70&amp;nbsp;million pounds of nickel has been mined since 2005.&lt;ref name="AS"/&gt; At the city of [[Thompson, Manitoba|Thompson]], nickel of the Thompson Belt is smelted and refined in facilities.&lt;ref name="AS"/&gt; This smelting and refining process contributes to about one-third of the total nickel output in Canada.&lt;ref name="AS"/&gt;

In the Cape Smith Belt of northern Quebec, the [[Raglan Mine]] lies in copper-nickel deposits of the ultramafic Katiniq Suite sills.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; The Katiniq Suite sills are also within an area that is presently explored for nickel, copper and platinum group element deposits.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; Copper, nickel and platinum group elements are associated with mafic-ultramafic rocks in the Labrador Trough that were formed during a period of magmatism 1,883&amp;nbsp;to 1,870&amp;nbsp;million years ago.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt;

With a [[topographic prominence]] of {{convert|20156|ft|m|abbr=out}} and a [[topographic isolation]] of {{convert|4629|mi|abbr=out}}, Denali is the [[List of peaks by prominence|third most prominent]] and [[List of peaks by isolation|third most isolated]] peak on Earth, after [[Mount Everest]] and [[Aconcagua]].  Located in the [[Alaska Range]] in the interior of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Alaska]], Denali is the centerpiece of [[Denali National Park and Preserve]].

The [[Koyukon people]] who inhabit the area around the mountain have referred to the peak as "Denali" for centuries. In 1896, a gold prospector named it "Mount McKinley" in support of then-presidential candidate [[William McKinley]]; that name was the official name recognized by the [[Federal government of the United States]] from 1917 until 2015. In August 2015, following the 1975 lead of the State of Alaska, the [[United States Department of the Interior]] announced the change of the [[Denali–Mount McKinley naming dispute|official name of the mountain]] to Denali.&lt;ref name="DenaliNameChangeDOI"&gt;{{cite press release|title=Denali Name Change|url=https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.opengov.ibmcloud.com/files/press-release/Denali%20Name%20Change.pdf|publisher=[[United States Department of the Interior|U.S. Department of the Interior]]|date=August 28, 2015|accessdate=August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OldNameReturns"&gt;{{cite web|last=Campbell|first=Jon|title=Old Name Officially Returns to Nation’s Highest Peak|url=https://www.usgs.gov/news/old-name-officially-returns-nations-highest-peak|publisher=U.S. Board of 6Geographic Names ([[United States Geological Survey|U.S. Geological Survey]])|date=August 30, 2015|accessdate=May 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1903, [[James Wickersham]] recorded the first attempt at climbing Denali, which was unsuccessful. In 1906, [[Frederick Cook]] claimed the [[first ascent]], which was later proven to be false. The first verifiable ascent to Denali's summit was achieved on June 7, 1913, by climbers [[Hudson Stuck]], [[Harry Karstens]], [[Walter Harper]], and [[Robert Tatum]], who went by the South Summit. In 1951, [[Bradford Washburn]] pioneered the West Buttress route, considered to be the safest and easiest route, and therefore the most popular currently in use.&lt;ref name="roberts" /&gt;

On September 2, 2015, the [[U.S. Geological Survey]] announced that the mountain is {{convert|20310|ft|m|0|abbr=out}} high,&lt;ref name=ADN/&gt; not {{convert|20320|ft|m|0|abbr=out}}, as measured in 1952 using [[photogrammetry]].

==Geology and features==
Denali is a [[granitic]] [[pluton]] lifted by [[tectonic]] pressure from the [[subduction]] of the [[Pacific Plate]] beneath the [[North American Plate]]; at the same time, the [[sedimentary]] material above and around the mountain was stripped away by [[erosion]].&lt;ref name="brease"&gt;{{cite web|last=Brease|first=P.|title=GEO-FAQS #1 – General Geologic Features|url=http://www.nps.gov/dena/upload/Brief%20Geology%20of%20Mt.pdf|publisher=National Park Service|date=May 2003|accessdate=2013-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The forces that lifted Denali also cause many deep [[earthquake]]s in Alaska and the [[Aleutian Islands]]. The Pacific Plate is seismically active beneath Denali, a tectonic region that is known as the "McKinley cluster".&lt;ref name="hanson"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hanson|first=Roger A.|title=Earthquake and Seismic Monitoring in Denali National Park|url=http://www.nps.gov/akso/nature/science/ak_park_science/PDF/2006Vol5-1/Earthquake-Monitoring.pdf|publisher=National Park Service|pages=23–25|accessdate=2013-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Denali has a summit [[elevation]] of {{convert|20310|ft|m|0|abbr=out}} above [[sea level]], making it the highest peak in North America and the northernmost mountain above 6,000&amp;nbsp;meters elevation in the world.&lt;ref name="ADN" /&gt;  Measured from base to peak at some {{convert|18000|ft|-2|abbr=on}}, it is among the largest mountains situated entirely above sea level (although some Asian mountains i.e. [[Rakaposhi]], [[Dhaulagiri]] and [[Nanga Parbat]] are even larger in this regard &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Meltzer|first=Anne|url=http://ees.lehigh.edu/groups/corners/np-papers/meltzer_etal_2001.pdf|title=Seismic characterization of an active metamorphic massif, Nanga Parbat, Pakistan Himalaya|page=1|year=2001|accessdate=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.summitpost.org/rakaposhi/173510|title=Rakaposhi on SummitPost|year=2008|accessdate=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en-gb.topographic-map.com/places/Dhaulagiri-Himal-7866735/|title=Topographic map of Dhaulagiri region|accessdate=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Denali rises from a sloping plain with elevations from {{convert|1000|to|3000|ft|abbr=on}}, for a base-to-peak height of {{convert|17000|to|19000|ft|m|-3|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clark|first=Liesl|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/denali/expedition/mission.html|title=NOVA Online: Surviving Denali, The Mission|publisher=Public Broadcasting Corporation|work=NOVA|year=2000|accessdate=2007-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, [[Mount Everest]] rises from the [[Tibetan Plateau]] at a much higher base elevation. Base elevations for Everest range from {{convert|13800|ft|m|-2|abbr=on}} on the south side to {{convert|17100|ft|m|-2|abbr=on}} on the Tibetan Plateau, for a base-to-peak height in the range of {{convert|12000|to|15300|ft|m|-2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="washburn_map"&gt;{{cite map |publisher= |title=Mount Everest |trans-title=|date= |year=1991 |url= |scale=1:50,000 |series= |version= |cartography=[[Bradford Washburn]] |section= |inset= |edition= |location= |language= |format= |isbn=3-85515-105-9}} Prepared for the [[Boston Museum of Science]], the Swiss Foundation for Alpine Research, and the [[National Geographic Society]]&lt;/ref&gt; Denali's base-to-peak height is little more than half the {{convert|33500|ft|m|-2|abbr=on}} of the volcano [[Mauna Kea]], which lies mostly under water.&lt;ref name="natgeo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mountains: Highest Points on Earth|url=http://science.nationalgeographic.com/science/earth/surface-of-the-earth/mountains-article/|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=2013-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Layout of the mountain===
Denali has two significant summits: the South Summit is the higher one, while the North Summit has an elevation of {{convert|19470|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="brease" /&gt; and a [[prominence]] of approximately {{convert|1270|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="pbnorth"&gt;{{cite peakbagger |pid=270 |name=Mount McKinley-North Peak, Alaska |accessdate=2013-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The North Summit is sometimes counted as a separate peak (see e.g., [[fourteener]]) and sometimes not; it is rarely climbed, except by those doing routes on the north side of the [[massif]].

Five large glaciers flow off the slopes of the mountain. The [[Peters Glacier (Alaska Range)|Peters Glacier]] lies on the northwest side of the massif, while the [[Muldrow Glacier]] falls from its northeast slopes. Just to the east of the Muldrow, and abutting the eastern side of the massif, is the [[Traleika Glacier]]. The [[Ruth Glacier]] lies to the southeast of the mountain, and the [[Kahiltna Glacier]] leads up to the southwest side of the mountain.&lt;ref name="areaparks"&gt;{{cite web|title=Denali National Park and Preserve|url=http://denali.areaparks.com/parkinfo.html?pid=7821|publisher=AreaParks.com|accessdate=2013-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="planetware"&gt;{{cite web|title=Denali National Park|url=http://www.planetware.com/tourist-attractions-/denali-national-park-us-ak-dp.htm#US-AK-MM|publisher=PlanetWare|accessdate=2013-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a length of {{convert|44|mi|abbr=on}}, the Kahiltna Glacier is the longest glacier in the Alaska Range.

==Naming==
{{main|Denali–Mount McKinley naming dispute}}
The [[Koyukon people|Koyukon]] [[Alaskan Athabaskans|Athabaskans]] who inhabit the area around the mountain have for centuries referred to the peak as ''Dinale'' or ''Denali''. The name is based on a Koyukon word for "high" or "tall".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adn.com/article/20150830/it-s-official-it-s-denali |title=McKinley no more: America's tallest peak to be renamed Denali |last=Martinson |first=Erica |date=August 30, 2015 |publisher=''Alaska Dispatch News'' |access-date=August 31, 2015 |quote=The name "Denali" is derived from the Koyukon name and is based on a verb theme meaning "high" or "tall," according to linguist James Kari of the Alaska Native Language Center at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, in the book "Shem Pete’s Alaska."

In 1896, a gold prospector named it ''McKinley'' as political support for then-presidential candidate [[William McKinley]], who became president the following year. The United States formally recognized the name Mount McKinley after President Wilson signed the Mount McKinley National Park Act of February 26, 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iXk1AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA558&amp;lpg=PA558&amp;dq=1917+mckinley+national+park+act&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RKllG6f-x3&amp;sig=gtP360oa0zTouyCFNCb4AWb_z3E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=a25hU_yFCqmrsQTs34HwBw&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=1917+mckinley+national+park+act&amp;f=false|title=Proposed Mt.

==History==
[[File:Stuck.Karstens.jpg|thumb|[[Hudson Stuck]] and [[Harry Karstens]], co-leaders of the first successful summit of Denali in 1913|alt=In a grayscale photograph, two men stand in front of a tent and snowy evergreen trees]]

The [[Koyukon language|Koyukon]] [[Athabaskan languages|Athabaskans]], living in the [[Yukon River|Yukon]], [[Tanana River|Tanana]] and [[Kuskokwim]] basins, were the first Native Americans with access to the flanks of the mountain.&lt;ref name="gnis"&gt;{{cite gnis | id = 1414314 | name = Denali| accessdate =2010-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; A British naval captain and explorer, [[George Vancouver]], is the first European on record to have sighted Denali, when he noted "distant stupendous mountains" while surveying the Knik Arm of the [[Cook Inlet]] on May 6, 1794.{{sfn|Beckey|1993|p=42}}  The Russian explorer [[Lavrenty Zagoskin]] explored the Tanana and Kuskokwim rivers in 1843 and 1844, and was likely the first European to sight the mountain from the other side.{{sfn|Beckey|1993|p=44}}

William Dickey, a New Hampshire-born resident of [[Seattle]], Washington who had been digging for gold in the sands of the [[Susitna River]], wrote, after his returning from Alaska, an account in the ''[[New York Sun]]'' that appeared on January 24, 1897.{{sfn|Beckey|1993|p=47}}  His report drew attention with the sentence "We have no doubt that this peak is the highest in North America, and estimate that it is over {{convert|20000|ft|m}} high." Until then, [[Mount Logan]] in Canada's [[Yukon Territory]] was believed to be the continent’s highest point. Though later praised for his estimate, Dickey admitted that other prospector parties had also guessed the mountain to be over {{convert|20000|ft|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Bill | last = Sherwonit | title = Denali: A Literary Anthology | publisher = [[The Mountaineers Books]] | location = [[Seattle]] | isbn = 0-89886-710-X | page = 9 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VG6m-HGVJa4C | date = October 1, 2000}}  See, particularly, chapter 4 (pp. 52–61): [https://books.google.com/books?id=mr5CfxqLRdgC&amp;pg=PA128&amp;lpg=PA128&amp;dq=%22The+Ascent+of+Denali%22 "Discoveries in Alaska"], 1897, by William A.

On November 5, 2012, the [[United States Mint]] released a [[Quarter (United States coin)|twenty-five cent piece]] depicting Denali National Park. It is the fifteenth of the [[America the Beautiful Quarters]] series. The [[obverse and reverse|reverse]] features a [[Dall sheep]] with the peak of Denali in the background.&lt;ref name="parkquarters"&gt;{{cite web|title=Denali National Park Quarter|url=http://www.parkquarters.com/denali-national-park-quarter|publisher=National Park Quarters|accessdate=2013-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climbing history===
The first recorded attempt to climb Denali was by [[Judge#United States|Judge]] [[James Wickersham]] in 1903, via the [[Peters Glacier (Alaska Range)|Peters Glacier]] and the North Face, now known as the [[Wickersham Wall]]. Because of the route's history of avalanche danger, it was not successfully climbed until 1963.{{sfn|Beckey|1993|p=139}}

Famed explorer Dr. [[Frederick Cook]] claimed the [[first ascent]] of the mountain in 1906. His claim was regarded with some suspicion from the start, but was also widely believed. It was later proved false, with some crucial evidence provided by [[Bradford Washburn]] when he was sketched on a lower peak.

[[File:Denali high camp.jpg|thumb|left|High camp ({{convert|17200|ft|m|disp=or|abbr=on}}) of the West Buttress Route pioneered by [[Bradford Washburn]], photographed in 2001|alt=Several tents are pitched near the edge of a snow-covered cliff]]

In 1910, four area locals – Tom Lloyd, Peter Anderson, Billy Taylor, and Charles McGonagall – known as the Sourdough Expedition, attempted to climb Denali despite a lack of climbing experience. The group spent approximately three months on the mountain.  Their purported summit ascent day included carrying a bag of doughnuts each, a thermos of hot chocolate, and a 14-foot (4.2 m) spruce pole.  Two of them reached the North Summit, the lower of the two, and erected the pole near the top. According to the group, the time they took to reach the summit was a total of 18 hours.  Until the first ascent in 1913, their claims were disbelieved, in part due to false claims they had climbed both summits.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

In 1912, the [[Herschel Clifford Parker|Parker]]-Browne expedition nearly reached the summit, turning back within just a few hundred yards of it due to harsh weather. The day after their descent, the [[Great Earthquake of 1912]] shattered the glacier they had ascended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=North peak of Mount McKinley: A Timely Escape |url=http://explore.americanalpineclub.org/index.php/Detail/Object/Show/object_id/5369 |publisher=The American Alpine Club |accessdate=October 5, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906153300/http://explore.americanalpineclub.org/index.php/Detail/Object/Show/object_id/5369 |archivedate=September 6, 2015 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heacox|first1=Kim|title=Rhythm of the Wild: A Life Inspired by Alaska's Denali National Park|date=2015|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=Connecticut|isbn=9781493003891|pages=55–56|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rmQlCQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;dq=Parker-Browne%201912%20earthquake%20mckinley&amp;pg=PR4#v=onepage&amp;q=Parker-Browne%201912%20earthquake%20mckinley&amp;f=false|accessdate=October 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first ascent of the main summit of Denali came on June 7, 1913, by a party led by [[Hudson Stuck]] and [[Harry Karstens]]. The first man to reach the summit was [[Walter Harper]], an [[Alaska Native]]. [[Robert Tatum]] also made the summit. Using the mountain's contemporary name, Tatum later commented, "The view from the top of Mount McKinley is like looking out the windows of Heaven!"{{sfn|Coombs|Washburn|1997|p=26}} They ascended the Muldrow Glacier route pioneered by the earlier expeditions, which is still often climbed today. Stuck confirmed, via binoculars, the presence of a large pole near the North Summit; this report confirmed the Sourdough ascent, and today it is widely believed that the Sourdoughs did succeed on the North Summit. However, the pole was never seen before or since, so there is still some doubt. Stuck also discovered that the Parker-Browne party were only about 200 feet (61 m) of elevation short of the true summit when they turned back.

The mountain is regularly climbed today.  In 2003, around 58% of climbers reached the top. But by 2003, the mountain had claimed the lives of nearly 100 mountaineers over time.&lt;ref name="glickman"&gt;{{cite news | last = Glickman | first = Joe | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/24/travel/man-against-the-great-one.html?pagewanted=all | title = Man Against the Great One | work =[[The New York Times]] | date = August 24, 2003 | accessdate = 2010-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of climbers use the West Buttress Route, pioneered in 1951 by [[Bradford Washburn]],&lt;ref name="roberts"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roberts |first=David |title=The Geography of Brad Washburn (1910–2007) |journal=[[National Geographic Adventure (magazine)|National Geographic Adventure]] |date=April 2007 |url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/mountaineering/bradford-washburn.html |accessdate=2013-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103231812/http://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/mountaineering/bradford-washburn.html |archivedate=November 3, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; after an extensive aerial photographic analysis of the mountain. Climbers typically take two to four weeks to ascend Denali. It is one of the [[Seven Summits]]; summiting all of them is a challenge for mountaineers.

On August 4, 2018, 5 people died in the [[K2 Aviation de Havilland Beaver (DHC-2) crash]] near Denali.

'''Desert dry wash''' is a North American desert [[vegetation type]] (or [[biome]]) occurring in the flat bottoms of canyons and drainages that lack water at or near the surface most of the year, and are subject to periodic severe flooding events.&lt;ref name=MDW&gt;Pam MacKay, Mojave Desert Wildflowers, 2nd Ed., p. 20-23&lt;/ref&gt; Desert dry wash is contrasted with [[desert riparian]] vegetation, which occurs in desert canyons and drainages where there is year-round water at or near the surface.&lt;ref name=MDW/&gt; Plants must either be able to survive the severe flooding conditions or be able to reestablish themselves before the next flooding event.&lt;ref name=MDW/&gt; Some of these plants have evolved so that in order for their seeds to germinate, the seeds must be scarified or abraded by tumbling sand, gravel, and rocks during the flooding event.&lt;ref name=MDW/&gt; They must then quickly send down roots deep enough to be able to tap into deep underground water reserves, in order to survive the dry period after the flooding.&lt;ref name=MDW/&gt; Common dominant species of the desert dry wash include smoke tree (''[[Psorothamnus spinosus]]''), desert willow (''[[Chilopsis linearis]]''), catclaw (''[[Senegalia greggii]]''), cheesebush (''[[Ambrosia salsola]]''), and waterweed (''[[Baccharis sergiloides]]'').&lt;ref name=MDW/&gt;

In [[meteorology]], '''Dines' compensation''' states that net mass convergence into a given column of air must be balanced by a net mass divergence from the same column of air.  The implication is that rising air in the atmosphere must be balanced by equal sinking or subsiding air.

Dines' compensation applies especially in mesoscale circulations (i.e. [[supercell]]s) and in macroscale and mesoscale [[tropical]] circulations.  For instance, it is not uncommon to see [[anti-cyclonic]] [[cirrus cloud|cirrus]] outflow from a [[hurricane]] in visible satellite imagery.

Dines' compensation applies differently in the mid-latitudes, as upper-level highs are not necessarily associated with surface lows.  Jet streaks and other upper level features, however, can contribute or support lower level convergence/divergence.

The '''EL34''' is a thermionic valve or [[vacuum tube]] of the power [[pentode]] type. It has an international [[Tube socket|octal]] base (indicated by the '3' in the part number) and is found mainly in the final output stages of [[sound|audio]] amplification circuits and was designed to be suitable as a series regulator by virtue of its high permissible voltage between heater and cathode and other parameters.  The American [[RETMA tube designation]] number for this tube is '''6CA7'''.  The USSR analog was 6P27S (Cyrillic: 6П27C).

==Specifications==
In common with all 'E' prefix tubes, using the [[Mullard–Philips tube designation]], the EL34 has a heater voltage of 6.3 V. According to the data sheets found in old vacuum tube reference manuals, a pair of EL34s with 800 V plate voltage can produce 90 watts output in [[class-AB1 amplifier|class AB1]] in push–pull configuration. However, this configuration is rarely found. One application of this type was in "Australian Sound" public address amplifiers commonly used in government schools in Australia in the 1950s, using four EL34s for ≈200 watts. More commonly found is a pair of EL34s running class AB1 in [[push–pull amplifier|push–pull]] around 375–450 V plate voltage and producing 50 watts output (if fixed bias is used), while a quad of EL34s running class AB1 in push–pull typically run anywhere from 425 to 500 V plate voltage and produces 100 watts output. This configuration is typically found in [[guitar amplifier]]s.

[[File:Jj e34l blue glass vacuum tube.jpg|thumb|left|Current production JJ E34L, blue glass edition]]

The EL34 is a pentode, while the 6L6, which delivers a similar range of power output, is a [[beam tetrode]] which [[RCA]] referred to as a ''beam power tube''. Although power pentodes and beam tetrodes have some differences in their principles of operation (the beam forming plates of the beam tetrode or fifth electrode (3rd grid) of the pentode, both serving to hinder the return of unabsorbed electrons from the anode (or plate) to the 4th electrode (2nd grid)) and have some internal construction differences, they are functionally closely equivalent. Unlike the [[6L6]], (EIA base 7AC) the EL34 has its grid 3 connection brought out to a separate Pin (Pin 1) (EIA base 8ET) and its heater draws 1.5 Amps compared to the 0.9 Amp heater in the 6L6. However, Sylvania (and possibly GE) marketed a tube as 6CA7 which was not only in a markedly different 'fat boy' envelope, but used a beam forming plate much like a 6L6. Examining the mica spacer on the top of the tube will confirm the lack of a suppressor grid. Although these tubes have similar (but not identical) characteristics, they are made very differently.

[[File:Svetlana EL34 tubes.jpg|thumb|left|Matched EL34 vacuum tubes by Russian manufacturer Svetlana]]

The EL34 was introduced in 1949 by [[Philips]] the parent company of [[Mullard]] and, although no longer made by them, is manufactured by [[JJ Electronic]], Shuguang, [[Svetlana (company)|Svetlana]] and [[Reflector (company)|Reflector]] ([[Sovtek]], [[Electro-Harmonix]], [[Tung-Sol]] and some brands), amongst others. Some firms make a related tube called an E34L which is rated to require a higher [[grid bias]] voltage, but which may be interchangeable in some equipment.

==Application==
The EL34 was widely used in higher-powered audio amplifiers of the 1960s and 1970s, such as the very popular [[Dynaco]] [[Dynaco Stereo 70|Stereo 70]]  and the [[LEAK|Leak]] TL25(mono) and Stereo 60, and is also widely used in high-end guitar amplifiers because it is characterized by greater [[distortion]] (considered desirable in this application) at lower power than other octal tubes{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} such as [[6L6]], [[KT88]] or [[6550]].  The EL34 is found in many British guitar amps and is associated with the "British Tone" ([[Vox (musical equipment)]], [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall]], [[Hiwatt]], [[Orange Amplification|Orange]]) as compared to the 6L6 which is generally associated with the "American Tone" ([[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]]/[[Mesa Boogie]], and the earlier classic Marshall "Plexi" amps used the [[KT66|KT 66]], a beam tetrode similar to the 6L6, as well).

Energy resources bring with them great social and economic promise, providing financial growth for communities and energy services for local economies. However, the infrastructure which delivers energy services can break down in an '''energy accident''', sometimes causing much damage, and '''energy fatalities''' can occur, and with many systems often deaths will happen even when the systems are working as intended.

Historically, [[coal mining]] has been the most dangerous energy activity and the list of historical [[coal]] [[Mining accident|mining disasters]] is a long one. [[Underground mining]] hazards include suffocation, gas poisoning, roof collapse and [[gas]] explosions. [[Open cut mining]] hazards are principally mine wall failures and vehicle collisions. In the US alone, more than 100,000 coal miners have been killed in accidents over the past century,&lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=125676950 "Former Miner Explains Culture Of Mining.]" NPR: National Public Radio. April 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; with more than 3,200 dying in 1907 alone.&lt;ref name="Coal Mining Steeped in History"&gt;"[http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/Mine/story?id=1475697 Coal Mining Steeped in History]". ABC News. January 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Benjamin K. Sovacool]], 279 ''major'' energy accidents occurred from 1907 to 2007 and they caused 182,156 deaths with $41 billion in property damages, with these figures not including deaths from smaller accidents.&lt;ref name=bksenpol&gt;[[Benjamin K. Sovacool]]. A preliminary assessment of major energy accidents, 1907–2007, ''[[Energy Policy (journal)|Energy Policy]]'' 36 (2008), pp. 1802–1820.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, by far the greatest energy fatalities that result from energy generation by humanity, is the creation of [[air pollution]]. The most lethal of which, [[particulate matter]], which is primarily generated from the burning of [[fossil fuel]]s and [[biomass]] is (counting outdoor air pollution effects only) estimated to cause 2.1 million deaths annually.&lt;ref name="spaceref.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spaceref.com/earth/fine-particulate-matter-map-shows-premature-mortality-due-to-air-polution.html |title=

According to [[Benjamin K. Sovacool]], while responsible for less than 1 percent of the total number of energy accidents, [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] facilities claimed 94 percent of reported immediate fatalities. Results on immediate fatalities are dominated by one disaster in which  Typhoon Nina in 1975 washed out the [[Shimantan Dam]] (Henan Province, China) and 171,000 people perished.&lt;ref name=bksenpol/&gt; While the other major accident that involved greater than 1000 immediate deaths followed the rupture of the [[1998 Jesse pipeline explosion|NNPC petroleum pipeline]] in 1998 and the resulting explosion.&lt;ref name=bksenpol/&gt; The other singular accident described by Sovacool is the ''predicted'' latent death toll of greater than 1000, as a result of the 1986 [[steam explosion]] at the [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl nuclear reactor]] in the Ukraine. With approximately 4000 deaths in total, to eventually result in the decades ahead due to the [[radio-isotope]] pollution released.

In the oil and gas industry, the need for improved [[safety culture]] and training within companies is evidenced by the finding that workers new to a company are more likely to be involved in fatalities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Coal mining accidents resulted in 5,938 immediate deaths in 2005, and 4746 immediate deaths in 2006 in China alone according to the [[World Wildlife Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pozon|first=Ina|author2=Puanani Mench|title=Coming Clean: The future of coal in the Asia-Pacific region|journal=WWF|year=2006|url=http://wwf.panda.org/index.cfm?uNewsID=112520|accessdate=22 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coal mining is the most dangerous occupation in China, the death rate for every 100 tons of coal mined is 100 times that of the death rate in the US and 30 times that achieved in South Africa. Moreover, 600,000 Chinese coal miners, as of 2004, were suffering from [[Coalworker's pneumoconiosis]] (known as "black lung") a disease of the lungs caused by long-continued inhalation of coal dust. And the figure increases by 70,000 miners every year in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-11/13/content_391242.htm|title= Coal mining: Most deadly job in China}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, coal mining has been a very dangerous activity and the list of historical [[coal]] [[mining disasters]] is a long one. In the US alone, more than 100,000 coal miners were killed in accidents over the past century,&lt;ref name="npr.org"/&gt; with more than 3,200 dying in 1907 alone.&lt;ref name="Coal Mining Steeped in History"/&gt; In the decades following this peak, an annual death toll of 1,500 miner fatalities occurred every year in the US until approximately the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.msha.gov/MSHAINFO/FactSheets/MSHAFCT2.HTM|title= Injury Trends in Mining }}&lt;/ref&gt; Coal mining fatalities in the US between 1990 and 2012 have continued to decline, with fewer than 100 each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.msha.gov/MSHAINFO/FactSheets/MSHAFCT10.HTM|title= Mine Safety and Health at a Glance}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See more [[Coal mining disasters in the United States]])

In the United States, in the 2000s, after three decades of regulation on the [[Environmental impact of the coal industry]], including regulations in the 1970s and 1990s from the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]], an act created to cut down on pollution related deaths from fossil fuel usage, US [[coal]] fired power plants were estimated, in the 2000s, to continue to cause between 10,000 and 30,000 latent, or air pollution related deaths per year, due to the emissions of [[sulfur dioxide]], [[nitrogen oxides]] and directly emitted [[particulate matter]] that result when coal is burnt.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hks.harvard.edu/m-rcbg/rpp/RFF-DP-12-25.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[World Health Organization]] in 2012, urban outdoor air pollution, from the burning of [[fossil fuel]]s and [[biomass]] is estimated to cause 3 million deaths worldwide per year and indoor air pollution from biomass and fossil fuel burning is estimated to cause approximately 4.3 million premature deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs313/en/|title= Air quality and health}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 a team of researchers estimated the number of premature deaths caused by particulate matter in outdoor air pollution as 2.1 million, occurring annually.&lt;ref name="spaceref.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iopscience.iop.org"/&gt;

==Economic costs==
Benjamin Sovacool says that while hydroelectric plants were responsible for the most fatalities,{{Contradict-inline|reason=The table in the Fatalities section above attributes a far higher number of fatalities to fossil fuels|date=June 2017}} [[nuclear power]] plants rank first in terms of their economic cost, accounting for 41 percent of all property damage. Oil and hydroelectric follow at around 25 percent each, followed by natural gas at 9 percent and coal at 2 percent.&lt;ref name=bksenpol/&gt; Excluding Chernobyl and the Shimantan Dam, the three other most expensive accidents involved the [[Exxon Valdez oil spill]] (Alaska), The [[Prestige oil spill]] (Spain), and the [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island nuclear accident]] (Pennsylvania).&lt;ref name=bksenpol/&gt; However analysis presented in the international Journal, ''Human and Ecological Risk Assessment'' found that coal, oil, [[Liquid petroleum gas]] and hydro accidents have cost more than nuclear power accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/10807030802387556|title=A Comparative Analysis of Accident Risks in Fossil, Hydro, and Nuclear Energy Chains|journal=Human and Ecological Risk Assessment: an International Journal|volume=14|issue=5|pages=947|year=2008|last1=Burgherr|first1=Peter|last2=Hirschberg|first2=Stefan}} See also [http://gabe.web.psi.ch/pdfs/_2012_LEA_Audit/TA01.pdf], p. 968 onwards.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern-day U.S. regulatory agencies frequently implement regulations on conventional pollution if one life or more is predicted saved per $6 million to $8 million of economic costs incurred.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times.

*'''April 26, 1942:''' A coal-[[dust explosion]] at [[Benxihu Colliery]] in [[Japanese empire|Japanese occupied China]] killed 1,549 making it the worst disaster in the [[history of coal mining]] superseding the 1,099 death toll of the [[Courrières mine disaster]] in 1906 and the second worst recorded energy accident, in terms of lives lost on a single day, after [[Banqiao dam]] in 1975. Despite the 1943 disaster on the hydroelectric [[Möhne Reservoir]] in the infamous [[No. 617 Squadron RAF|dambusters]] raid killing 1,579 and thus would technically put it in second place, however as that was a deliberate act of war, it may not be included as an "[[accident]]" under the strictest use of the term.

* '''March 1967:''' The {{SS|Torrey Canyon||2}} [[Oil tanker|supertanker]] was shipwrecked off the west coast of Cornwall, England, causing an environmental disaster. This was the first major [[oil spill]] at sea.
* '''August 1975:''' The [[Banqiao Dam]] flooded in the Henan Province of China due to heavy rains and poor construction quality of the dam, which was built during [[Great Leap Forward]]. The flood immediately killed over 100,000 people, and another 150,000 died of subsequent epidemic diseases and famine, bringing the total death toll to around 250,000—making it the worst technical disaster ever. In addition, about 5,960,000 buildings collapsed, and 11 million residents were made homeless.
* '''March 16, 1978:''' The ''[[Amoco Cadiz]]'', a [[Oil tanker|VLCC]] owned by the company Amoco (now merged with BP) sank near the Northwest coasts of France, resulting in the spilling of 68,684,000 US Gallons of crude oil (1,635,000 barrels). This is the largest oil spill of its kind (spill from an oil tanker) in history.
* '''January 8, 1979''': [[Betelgeuse incident]], a French constructed oil tanker which entered [[Cork Harbour]], [[Ireland]], exploded and killed 50 people, the disaster also caused extensive harbor damage.
* '''March 28, 1979:''' [[Three Mile Island accident]]. Partial nuclear meltdown. Mechanical failures in the non-nuclear secondary system, followed by a stuck-open [[pilot-operated relief valve]] (PORV) in the primary system, allowed large amounts of reactor coolant to escape. Plant operators initially failed to recognize the loss of coolant, resulting in a partial meltdown. The reactor was brought under control but not before radioactive [[gas]]es were released into the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=Walker231&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Three Mile Island: A Nuclear Crisis in Historical Perspective]] |first=J.

* '''June 3, 1979:''' [[Ixtoc I oil spill]]. The Ixtoc I exploratory oil well suffered a blowout resulting in the third largest oil spill and the second largest accidental spill in history.
* '''November 20, 1980:''' A Texaco oil rig drilled into a salt mine transforming the [[Lake Peigneur]], a freshwater lake before the accident, into a salt water lake.
* '''February 15, 1982:''' The mobile offshore oil rig [[Ocean Ranger]] is struck by a rogue wave off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada and sinks with the loss of all 84 crew.
* '''July 23, 1984:''' [[Romeoville, Illinois]], Union Oil refinery explosion killed 19 people.

'''Energy in Malta''' describes [[Energy industry|energy]] production, consumption and import in [[Malta]].

Malta has no domestic resource of fossil fuels and no gas distribution network. Gross consumption has increased by 53% in 1990-2004. In 2008 the [[renewable energy]] market was at an early stage  in Malta. Only solar energy and biofuels were used. The potential for [[Solar energy|solar]] and [[Wind power|wind]] is substantial according to the EU.&lt;ref name=fact2008&gt;[http://www.energy.eu/renewables/display.php?chart=factsheets/2008_res_sheet_malta_en.pdf Malta. Renewable Energy Fact Sheet] 23 Jan 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Energy import dependency was 100% in 2004.&lt;ref name=fact2007&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/energy/energy_policy/doc/factsheets/mix/mix_mt_en.pdf MALTA – Energy Mix Fact Sheet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002203232/http://ec.europa.eu/energy/energy_policy/doc/factsheets/mix/mix_mt_en.pdf |date=2 October 2008 }} January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electricity==
In 2005 100% of electricity was from oil and in 2017 it was natural gas with oil as backup. Malta has four electricity plants operational and the total combined nominal installed capacity is 537.8 MW.&lt;ref name=Enemalta&gt;[https://www.enemalta.com.mt/about-us/delimara-power-station/]&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Malta–Sicily interconnector]], which has been in operation since April 2015, allows for an electricity link between the Maltese Islands and the Italian electricity market has bidirectional flow capacity of 200 MW.&lt;ref name=interconnector&gt;[https://www.enemalta.com.mt/about-us/malta-italy-interconnector/ Malta – Italy Interconnector], Enemalta. Retrieved 2018-11-14&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transport fuel==
All transport fuel is petroleum, or derived from the same (diesel, etc.)

==Renewable energy==
The European Union [[Directive 2009/28/EC]] set Malta's target share of renewable energy at 10% by the year 2020.&lt;ref&gt;measured as share of the gross final consumption of energy&lt;/ref&gt; The mandatory 10% target for transport concern also Malta.

The [[National Renewable Energy Action Plan]] for Malta is given in July 2010. According to the NREAP Malta's fuel mis in 2020 will be:

* Renewable transport will be 37 ktoe
* [[Wind power|Wind]], 0.3 TWh or 22 ktoe
* [[Biomass|Bio]] electricity 0.1 TWh or 12 ktoe
* [[Wind power]] 15 MW and 38 GWh onshore wind and 95 MW and 216 GWh offshore wind.
* [[Solar photovoltaic]] 28 MW (43 GWh) and [[solar thermal]] 3 ktoe.
* The renewable electricity from solid biomass 86 GWh (7 ktoe) and [[biogas]] 50 GWh (4 ktoe).
* Renewable heat 0 ktoe for solid biomass and 2 ktoe for biogas.

An '''equivalent dumping coefficient''' is a [[mathematics|mathematical]] [[coefficient]] used in the calculation of the energy dispersed when a structure moves. As a civil engineering term, it defines the ''percent of a cycle of oscillation that is absorbed (converted to heat by friction)'' for the structure or sub-structure under analysis. Usually it is assumed that the equivalent dumping coefficient is [[linear]], which is to say invariant compare to oscillatory amplitude. Modern seismic studies have shown this not to be a satisfactory assumption for larger civic structures, and have developed sophisticated amplitude and frequency based functions for ''equivalent dumping coefficient''.

When a [[building]] moves, the materials it is made from absorb a fraction of the [[kinetic energy]] (this is especially true of [[concrete]]) due primarily to [[friction]] and to viscous or elastomeric resistance which convert [[Motion (physics)|motion]] or kinetic energy to [[heat]].

[[Image:Extinction cross.jpg|thumb|right|An extinction cross photographed with a CCD camera using a green laser beam and a polarizer]]
The '''extinction cross''' is an [[optical phenomenon]] that is seen when trying to extinguish a [[laser beam]] or non-planar white light using crossed [[polarizer]]s. Ideally, crossed (90° rotated) polarizers block all light, since light which is polarized along the polarization axis of the first polarizer is perpendicular to the polarization axis of the second. When the beam is not perfectly [[collimated light|collimated]], however, a characteristic fringing pattern is produced.

'''Falih Rıfkı Atay Nature Park''' ({{lang-tr|Falih Rıfkı Atay Tabiat Parkı}}) is a [[nature park]] located in [[Sarıyer]] district of [[Istanbul Province]], Turkey.&lt;ref name="itp"/&gt; 

Situated {{convert|7|km|mi|abbr=on}} northwest of [[Bahçeköy, Sarıyer|Bahçeköy]] neighborhood of Sarıyer and next to the [[Neşet Suyu Nature Park]], it covers an area of {{convert|16.33|ha|abbr=on}}. It was established in 2011, and is one of the nine nature parks inside the [[Belgrad Forest]]. The protected area is named in honor of journalist, writer and politician [[Falih Rıfkı Atay]] (1894–1971).&lt;ref name="itp"/&gt;

[[Serbs]] who were taken prisoners of war at the [[Siege of Belgrade (1521)]] by [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[sultan]] [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] (reigned 1520–1566), were brought to Istanbul and settled in a village, which used to lie within the park boundaries.&lt;ref name="snf"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CreightonWinsor1920"/&gt; The nature park contains the ruins of a church, which is a protected [[material culture|historic building]] and was registered as [[cultural heritage]] in November 1999.&lt;ref name="itp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kk"/&gt;

The nature park offers outdoor recreational activities such as [[hiking]], [[cycling]] and [[picnic]]ing for visitors on daily basis.&lt;ref name="ios"/&gt; There are playgrounds for children. Admission is charged for visitors and vehicles and an open-air restaurant serves the visitors.&lt;ref name="itp"/&gt;

==Ecosystem==
The nature park has rich flora and fauna.&lt;ref name="itp"/&gt;

'''Flora'''

The park is the habitat for diverse species of plant. The main trees present are oak (''[[Quercus robur]]'') and  hornbeam (''[[Carpinus betulus]]''). Other [[deciduous]] trees include sessile oak (''[[Quercus petraea]]''), kasnak oak (''[[Quercus vulcanica]]'') and shrubs are blackberry (''[[Rubus plicatus]]''), butcher's-broom (''[[Ruscus aculeatus]]''), tree heath (''[[Erica arborea]]'') and bay laurel (''[[Laurus nobilis]]''). Some uncommon  trees include silver linden (''[[Tilia argentea]]'') and oriental beech (''[[Fagus orientalis]]''). Anatolian [[catbrier]] (''Smilax excelsa''), [[aubretia]] (''Aubrieata cultorum''), wild strawberry (''Fragaria'') and cathip (''[[Nepeta cataria]]'') are some of the flowering plants found in the nature park.&lt;ref name="itp"/&gt;

'''Fauna'''
[[File:BelgradForest (25).jpg|thumb|Bahçeköy Deer farm in the Belgrad Forest.]]
Mainly observed fauna of the nature park are  [[porcupine]]s, [[squirrel]]s, [[turtle]]s, [[magpie]]s, [[crow]]s, [[woodpecker]]s, [[sparrow]]s and [[finch]]es.&lt;ref name="itp"/&gt;  Across the nature park, there is a [[deer farm]] ({{lang-tr|Geyik Üretme İstasyonu}}).&lt;ref name="itp"/&gt;

'''Earth Science Information Partners''' ('''ESIP''') is a community of data and [[information technology]] practitioners that  come together to coordinate Earth science [[interoperability]] efforts. Participation in ESIP allows members to enhance their  [[data management]] capabilities.

ESIP arranges collaboration through in-person meetings and virtually through [[collaboration]] space on the Web. Partners use these forums for [[knowledge exchange]] and collaboration.

Created by [[NASA]] in 1998, the ESIP Federation was formed in response to a [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] recommendation calling for the involvement of community stakeholders in the development of NASA’s [[EOSDIS]] as a critical element of the [[U.S. Global Change Research Program]] (http://www.gcrio.org/USGCRP/LaJolla/cover.html). ESIP includes more than 120 member organizations. ESIP membership includes federal data centers, government research laboratories, research universities, education resource providers, technology developers, and nonprofit and commercial enterprises.

== History ==
ESIP is a community drawn from agencies and individuals who provide handling for Earth and [[environmental science]] data and information. ESIP was founded in 1998 by NASA in response to a National Research Council (NRC) review of the Earth Observation System Data and Information System (EOSDIS). The NRC called on NASA to develop a new, distributed structure that would be operated and managed by the Earth science community that would include those responsible for all elements of [[Earth observation]], including observation, research, and ultimately, application and education.

Beginning with 24 NASA-funded partners, ESIP's purpose was to evolve methods to make Earth science data easy to preserve, locate, access and use by [[research]], [[education]], and commercial interests. NASA developed the ESIP Federation by starting with a set of working [[prototype]] projects called ESIPs, representing both the research and applications development communities. These prototype projects were joined by nine NASA data archive centers to form the core of the early ESIP Federation and were responsible for creating its governing structures and the collaborative community it is today.

By 2001, the ESIP Federation created a [[non-profit corporation]] called the Foundation for Earth Science (Foundation). Through a [[Memorandum of understanding|Memorandum of Understanding]] with the ESIP Federation, the foundation provided management support to the ESIP Federation as it moved from an operational prototype to an independent organization.

In 2002, Foundation staff were hired to support the work of the ESIP Federation. The foundation helped create operating policies for the ESIP Federation and facilitated the development of its first strategic plan, adopted by the ESIP Federation’s Assembly in 2004. NOAA’s [[data center]]s joined the ESIP Federation.

Beginning in July 2007 in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], a Strategic Planning Working Group was formed to develop a new vision of the ESIP Federation in its second decade.

The ESIP Federation’s partner organizations include all [[NOAA]], NASA and [[USGS]] Earth observing data centers, government research laboratories, research universities, modelers, education resource providers, technology developers, nonprofits and commercial enterprises.

In 2009 and 2010 new ESIP Federation communities formed around data preservation and [[Data steward|stewardship]], [[information quality]], and [[data visualization]].

== Partners ==
ESIP is made up of more than 110 member organizations that span NASA, NOAA, [[Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]], USGS and DOE research-funded groups. ESIP's partners represent earth science data and technology interests. There are four types of partners; Type I includes Data Centers, Type II are data and information product providers, Type III are commercial and non-commercial organizations that develop tools for Earth Science and Type IV are the funding providers, NASA, NOAA and USGS.  A full listing of ESIP Federation Partners is at the organization's [http://www.esipfed.org/esip-member-list  website].

'''Geothermal power in Indonesia''' is an increasingly significant source of [[Renewable Energy|renewable energy]]. As a result of its [[Volcanism of Indonesia|volcanic]] geology, it is often reported that [[Indonesia]] has 40% of the world's potential [[geothermal energy|geothermal resources]], estimated at 28,000 [[watt|megawatts]] (MW).&lt;ref name="SMH"&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/environment/indonesias-hot-terrain-set-to-power-its-future-20100430-tzd2.html Tom Allard: "Indonesia's hot terrain set to power its future"], ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 1 May 2010, retrieved 25 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently Indonesia is the world's third largest [[geothermal electricity]] producer after the [[Geothermal energy in the United States|United States]] and the [[Geothermal power in the Philippines|Philippines]]. Installed production capacity (2011) is almost 1,200&amp;nbsp;MW from six geothermal fields in [[Java]], North [[Sumatra]] and North [[Sulawesi]].&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/27/business/global/27iht-renindo.html?_r=1&amp;ref=geothermal-power Hillary Brenhouse:''Indonesia Seeks to Tap Its Huge Geothermal Reserves'', in the New York Times, July 26, 2010], retrieved 25 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, geothermal energy represented 1.9% of the country's total energy supply and 3.7% of its electric power.&lt;ref name="IEA 2008"&gt;[http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2008/Indonesia2008.pdf International Energy Agency: ''Energy Policy Review of Indonesia'', Paris, 2008] {{ISBN|978-92-64-04828-7}}, retrieved 26 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[2010 World Geothermal Congress]] in [[Bali]], President [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]] announced a plan to build 44 new geothermal plants by 2014, more than tripling capacity to 4,000&amp;nbsp;MW. By 2025, Indonesia aims to produce more than 9,000&amp;nbsp;MW of geothermal power, becoming the world's leading geothermal energy producer.&lt;ref name="SMH"/&gt; This would account for 5% of Indonesia's total energy needs.&lt;ref name="IEA 2008"/&gt;

A detailed report on the geothermal sector in Indonesia issued in 2015 by the Asian Development Bank and World Bank, ''[http://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/157824/unlocking-indonesias-geothermal-potential.pdf Unlocking Indonesia's Geothermal Potential]'', indicated that reforms in key areas of policy were likely to be needed to stimulate sustained expansion in the sector.

The first proposal on energy from volcanoes came in 1918 during the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonial era]]. In 1926, five test borings were drilled in Java's [[Kamojang|Kawah Kamojang]] field, the third being the first that was successful.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/y48n253548246532/ M. Neumann Van Padang:''The steam borings in Kawah Kamodjang'', in Bulletin of Volcanology, Volume 23, Number 1, 251-255, ] {{doi|10.1007/BF02596652}}, retrieved 25 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1980s, it was still discharging superheated steam from a depth of 66 metres at a temperature of 140&amp;nbsp;°C and a pressure of 3.5 to 4 [[Bar (unit)|bars]]. A prefeasibility study for electricity generation was initiated in 1972 by Geothermal Energy New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onepetro.org/mslib/servlet/onepetropreview?id=00010445&amp;soc=SPE Wilson, Raymond: ''Stage 1 Development of the Kamojang Geothermal Power Station and Steamfield - West Java, Indonesia'', Offshore South East Asia Show, Singapore, 1982], retrieved 26 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The first generator was inaugurated in 1983 by President [[Suharto]] and subsequently expanded in 1987. Current capacity is 140&amp;nbsp;MW.&lt;ref name="Indonesia Power"&gt;[http://www.indonesiapower.co.id/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=151:unit-bisnis-pembangkitan-kamojang&amp;catid=64:business-unit&amp;Itemid=92 Indonesia Power: Kamojang Generation Business Unit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101102054135/http://indonesiapower.co.id/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=151%3Aunit-bisnis-pembangkitan-kamojang&amp;catid=64%3Abusiness-unit&amp;Itemid=92 |date=2010-11-02 }}, retrieved 26 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the mid-1980s, [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]], the world's largest geothermal power producer, has operated two geothermal fields in West Java at [[Mount Salak|Salak]] and Darajat&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; with a combined capacity of around 365&amp;nbsp;MW.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSJAK17573620071101 Reuters:''Chevron Indonesia plans to expand geothermal power'', Nov 1, 2007], retrieved 25 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1989 and 1997 explorations were conducted at the [[Sibayak]] geothermal field in northern Sumatra,&lt;ref&gt;[http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200103/000020010300A1057920.php Atmojo,J.O. et al: ''Evaluation of Reservoir Characteristics Using Well Data of Sibayak Geothermal Field, North Sumatra, Indonesia'' in Mem Fac Eng Kyushu Univ, Vol.60, No.3, 2000], retrieved 30 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently a 12&amp;nbsp;MW plant has been placed in operation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pgeindonesia.com/index.php?lang=en&amp;option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=27&amp;Itemid= PT Pertamina: Working Area Maps] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715072007/http://pgeindonesia.com/index.php?lang=en&amp;option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=27&amp;Itemid= |date=2011-07-15 }} {{id}}, retrieved 30 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, the Indonesia Geothermal Association (''Asosiasi Panasbumi Indonesia'' - API), a non-governmental organisation, was established to promote and advertise geothermal energy. It has approximately 500 members including geothermal experts, companies, and stakeholders.&lt;ref name="IEA 2008"/&gt;  The [[Wayang Windu Geothermal Power Station]] in [[West Java]], owned by British [[Star Energy]], has been in operation since 2000. It currently comprises two units with a total capacity of 227&amp;nbsp;MW. There are plans for a third unit of 127&amp;nbsp;MW which is expected to be on-stream by mid-2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.power-technology.com/projects/wayang-windu/ www.power-technology.com: Wayang Windu Geothermal Power Station], retrieved 25 August 2010{{Unreliable source?|reason=domain on WP:BLACKLIST|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exploration and development==
Exploration of the [[Bedugul]] Geothermal Field in [[Bali]] started in 1974&lt;ref name="IGA"&gt;[http://www.geothermal.org/IGANews/IGANews0305.pdf Hochstein, M. P. et al.:''The Bedugul Geothermal Field, Bali'', in International Geothermal Association (IGA) News, No.59, 2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807134121/http://www.geothermal.org/IGANews/IGANews0305.pdf |date=2008-08-07 }}, retrieved 11 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and though production capacity was estimated at 175&amp;nbsp;MW in 2008, the project is on hold after being opposed by local residents.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSJAK14417520080630 Davies, Ed and Lema, Karen:''Geothermal-rich SE Asia struggles to tap earth's power'', in Reuters Jun 28, 2008], retrieved 11 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[2010 World Geothermal Congress]] in Bali, several companies were awarded the rights to develop geothermal fields and power plants: Golden Spike Indonesia won the tender to develop a power plant at [[Mount Ungaran]] in Central Java, Sokoria Geothermal Indonesia gained rights to develop a plant at [[Ende, Indonesia|Ende]], on [[Flores]] island, while Supreme Energy was chosen to develop plants at [[Rajabasa|Mount Rajabasa]] in Lampung and [[Solok]] in West Sumatra. These projects were estimated to require a total investment of US$1.68 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://embassyofindonesia.it/5-billion-of-deals-signed-at-world-geothermal-congress/ Indonesian Embassy, Rome], retrieved 30 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2010, a total of 265 potential sites for plants have been identified across the country.&lt;ref name="SMH"/&gt;  Development of the industry, however, involves a range of complex policy issues, some of which are proving to be a continuing source of controversy.&lt;ref&gt;Surya Darma, Sugiharto Harsoprayitno, Herman Darnel Ibrahim, Agusman Effendi, Agus Triboesono (2010), '[http://b-dig.iie.org.mx/BibDig/P10-0464/pdf/0308.pdf Geothermal in Indonesia: Government Reguatlions and Power Utilities, Opportunities and Challenges of its Development'], in ''Proceedings World Geothermal Congress 2010'', Bali Indonesia, 25–30 April.&lt;/ref&gt;  In mid-2011, for example, the Indonesian Government issued an expected regulation providing certain guarantees for investors with the aim of encouraging increased investment in the geothermal sector.  However, investor response was guarded, suggesting that key aspects had not been addressed in the regulation.&lt;ref&gt;Rangga D. Fadillah, [http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/09/13/govt-guarantee-ipp-projects-%E2%80%98unclear%E2%80%99.html Govt guarantee for IPP projects is 'unclear'], ''[[The Jakarta Post]]'', 13 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2013, PT Pertamina Geothermal Energy (PGE) -- a geothermal business branch of state oil and gas company [[Pertamina|PT Pertamina]]—said that it planned to develop eight new geothermal plants with a total capacity of 655&amp;nbsp;MW (expected to require $2.0 bn of new investments). These included:

|col2=
*  30 MW at Karaha
*  35 MW at [[Kamojang]]

Of these, several were to be financed with loans from [[World Bank]] and [[Japan International Cooperation Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/business/pertamina-geothermal-receives-1b-in-loans-to-develop-3-power-plants/347441 Yessar Rosendar:''Pertamina Geothermal Receives $1b In Loans to Develop 3 Power Plants'', in Jakarta Globe, December 14, 2009], retrieved 30 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, work is starting on the Sarulla geothermal plant in North Sumatra with a total planned capacity of 320 MW.  The plant has been on the books since the early 1990s but development was stalled over various issues.  The plant, expected to cost around $1.65 billion, will be built with financial support from the [[Asian Development Bank]] along with the [[Japan Bank for International Cooperation]] and other lenders.&lt;ref&gt;Raras Chahyafitri, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/11/27/sarulla-plant-construction-set-march.html Sarulla plant construction set for March'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 27 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The first 110 MW started in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.power-technology.com/projects/sarullgeothermalpowe/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Installed capacity ==
According to the Renewable Energy Policy Network's ''Renewables 2013 Global Status Report'', Indonesia has the third largest installed generating capacity in the world in the geothermal sector. With 1.3 GW installed capacity, Indonesia trails only the United States (3.4 GW) and the Philippines (1.9 GW). However it leads Mexico (1.0 GW), Italy (0.9 GW), New Zealand (0.8 GW), Iceland (0.7 GW), and Japan (0.5 GW).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ren21.org/Portals/0/documents/Resources/GSR/2013/GSR2013_lowres.pdf Renewables 2013 Global Status Report]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent developments==
In recent years, the Indonesian Government has announced plans for two 'fast-track' increases in the total capacity of Indonesia's electricity generation network of 10,000&amp;nbsp;MW each.  Under the '''second 10,000&amp;nbsp;MW fast-track plan''' it was forecast that a relatively large share of 3,970&amp;nbsp;MW would be installed in geothermal plants. But under the '''first 10,000&amp;nbsp;MW fast-track plan''', investment in the geothermal sector appears to be lagging.

* '''September 2011:''' The Indonesian state-owned electricity utility [[Perusahaan Listrik Negara]] (PLN) announced that the outlook was that by 2014 only 1,200&amp;nbsp;MW of power was likely to be produced from geothermal plants. The then-president director of the PLN, [[Dahlan Iskan]], said that plans to develop a number of geothermal plants were behind schedule because private sector investors were reluctant to invest as a result of the perceived risks in the sector.&lt;ref&gt;Rangga D. Fadillah, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/10/01/delays-may-hit-several-geothermal-projects.html Electricity: Delays may hit several geothermal projects'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 1 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''July 2012:''' A senior official from the PLN reported that there were 13 geothermal power plants that were still stuck in the exploration stages and were likely to miss development deadlines.  Problems mentioned included disappointing results at drilling sites, lack of adequate supporting infrastructure (mainly roads), and difficulties that firms faced in obtaining required permits for their activities from the forestry department and local governments.&lt;ref&gt;Rabby Pramudatama, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/07/26/pln-s-geothermal-plants-likely-miss-deadline.html PLN's geothermal plants likely to miss deadline'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 26 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''June 2013:''' The first International Geothermal Conference and Exhibition was held in Indonesia.  The relatively slow development of the sector attracted comment.  The Minister for Energy and Mineral Resources announced that the prices to be paid for energy supplied by geothermal suppliers would be increased to encourage activity in the sector.  Speaking at the conference, the Indonesian Vice President [[Boediono]] called for changes in policy to speed up development.&lt;ref&gt;Slamet Susanto, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/06/13/ri-s-geothermal-energy-still-untouched.html RI's geothermal energy still "untouched"'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 13 June 2013, and {http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/06/13/govt-set-raise-prices-geothermal-power.html Govt set to raise prices of geothermal power'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 13 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''June 2013:'''  Work on a significant geothermal project in [[Lampung]] in South Sumatra (planned size, 220&amp;nbsp;MW) was suspended following local protests.  Local villagers in the [[Rajabasa|Mount Rajabasa]] area claimed that development of the project would damage the social structure of the community.  The Forestry Minister, [[Zulkifli Hasan]], sided with the local community saying that the company developing the site, PT Supreme Energy, would need to convince the local villagers of the safety of the project.  In response, the chair of the Indonesian Geothermal Association said that the government should shut all geothermal projects if top officials were "half-hearted" in their commitment to investors.&lt;ref&gt;Amal S. Azwar, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/06/20/protests-freeze-out-lampung-geothermal-power-plant.html Protests freeze out Lampung geothermal power plant'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 20 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''August 2014:''' The Indonesian Parliament approved a new Geothermal Law aimed at facilitating development in the sector.  Key points of the new law included the following: (a) Geothermal activities would no longer be considered mining activities; development of geothermal resources can be carried out in forest conservation areas. Under the existing Forestry Law, mining operations are prohibited in protected forests. (b) Tenders for geothermal projects will be called by the central government instead of by local administrations.  (c) New geothermal projects will be developed under new, more favorable, pricing arrangements. (d) Local administrations will receive a portion of the revenues derived from geothermal resources. (e) Quite detailed provisions were set out regarding such things as surveys of geothermal sites, exploration, tendering procedures, the size of working areas, arrangements for determining prices and administrative sanctions, obligations of the holders of geothermal licenses, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;Raras Cahyafitri, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/08/27/legal-barrier-geothermal-development-removed.html Legal barrier to geothermal development removed'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 27 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policy issues==
Expansion in the sector appears to be being held back by a range of factors including an uncertain regulatory environment (including, especially, uncertainty over land laws) and the perceived risks of development.&lt;ref&gt;Hanan Nugroho, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/10/23/geothermal-challenges-keep-development-track.html Geothermal: Challenges to keep the development on track'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 23 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The Indonesian Government's plans for development of the geothermal sector rely largely on private sector investment.&lt;ref&gt;A comment on the issues holding geothermal issues back from the private sector point of view is in an interview with a senior Chevron executive at '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/05/05/executive-column-better-pricing-structure-needed-geothermal-development-chevron.html Executive Column: Better pricing structure needed for geothermal development:  Cheveron'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 5 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  But numerous reports indicate that private sector investors are concerned about a range of risks including technical (geological) risks, regulatory risks stemming from uncertain government policy, and financial risks arising from the pricing policies determined by the Indonesian Government.&lt;ref&gt;Rangga D. Fadillah, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/08/19/geothermal-firm-awaiting-govt-contract-assurance.html Geothermal firm awaiting govt contract assurance'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 18 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; For example, coal has been indirectly subsidised through the Domestic Market Obligation policy, which requires coal companies to sell at a government-specified, subsidised rate to the national utility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chattopadhyay D, Jha S|first=|date=2014|title=The impact of energy subsidies on the power sector in Southeast Asia|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040619014000839?via%3Dihub|journal=The Electricity Journal|volume=27 |issue=4|pages=70–83|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, geothermal power has enjoyed relatively unfavourable tender processes and is sold at higher prices. This makes it difficult for geothermal plants to compete with conventional fuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Colenbrander S, Gouldson A, Sudmant AH, Papargyropoulou E|first=|date=2015|title=The economic case for low-carbon development in rapidly growing developing world cities: A case study of Palembang, Indonesia|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030142151500021X#bib14|journal=Energy Policy|volume=80|pages=24–35|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is disagreement within the Indonesian Government as to how to mitigate risks or, where that is not possible, who should bear these risks. Policy makers in the power sector, with an eye to meeting the government's official investment targets, are often inclined to the view that at least some of the risks should be borne by the Indonesian Government through the national budget managed by the Ministry of Finance.&lt;ref&gt;See the suggestions for reducing risk for private investors from the president director of the Indonesian electricity company in Rangga D. Fadillah, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/10/01/delays-may-hit-several-geothermal-projects.html Electricity: Delays may hit several geothermal projects'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 1 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Official policy from the Ministry of Finance has traditionally been cautious, resisting the suggestion that unspecified risks should be borne by the Indonesian budget.

In response to reports about certain of the risks that private sector investors were concerned about, in mid-2011 the government issued a regulation intended to provide guarantees that the state electricity utility PLN would meet financial obligations to independent power producers (IPPs) who invested in the geothermal sector. But the regulation was quickly criticised by representatives of private investors as being too limited and for failing to clarify important concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Rangga D. Fadillah, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/09/13/govt-guarantee-ipp-projects-%E2%80%98unclear%E2%80%99.html Govt guarantee for IPP projects is 'unclear' '], ''The Jakarta Post'', 13 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pricing policy'''

Prices have been another important policy issue in the sector.  In an effort to encourage private sector investment, the Indonesian government has been establishing a [[feed-in tariff]] scheme by instructing state electricity utility PLN to purchase power from geothermal projects at various rates ranging from around 6.5 US cents to over 12 US cents per kWh.&lt;ref&gt;'[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/11/04/power-deals-signed-electrification-rate.html Power deals signed to up electrification rate'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 4 November 2011.  See also Kemal Azis Stamboel, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/01/02/fuel-mix-policy-and-energy-security.html Fuel mix policy and energy security'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 2 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The government is also preparing a regulation that is expected to specify the price that the PLN must purchase power from geothermal plans in the second 10,000&amp;nbsp;MW fast-track electricity sector program which the government has announced; this regulation is expected to be finalised by early 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Rangga D. Fadillah, 'More regulations planned to boost geothermal use', ''The Jakarta Post'', 8 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental issues==
According to the Ministry of Forestry, around 80% of geothermal reserves are located in designated conserved forest areas. The 2009 mineral and coal mining law lists geothermal exploration as a mining activity so a presidential decree would be required to allow geothermal activities conserved forest areas. According to the ministry, geothermal mining is unlikely to cause environmental harm.&lt;ref&gt;Rangga D Fadillah, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/01/13/govt-allow-geothermal-mining-activities-conserved-forests.htm Govt to allow geothermal mining activities in conserved forests'] in ''The Jakarta Post'', 13 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2011 the Indonesian government imposed a two-year moratorium on logging. However this excepts the energy sector, including geothermal activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/05/20/indonesia-environment-moratorium-idUKL4E7GK0I220110520 Reuters, 20 May 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hadean.png|thumb|Artist's impression of a Hadean landscape]]
The '''Hadean''' ({{IPAc-en|pron|ˈ|h|eɪ|d|i|ə|n}}) is a [[Eon (geology)|geologic eon]] of the Earth predating the [[Archean]]. It began with the formation of the [[Earth]] about 4.6&amp;nbsp;billion years ago and ended, as defined by the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy|ICS]], 4&amp;nbsp;billion years ago.&lt;ref name="International Chronostratigraphic Chart"&gt;{{cite web |title=International Chronostratigraphic Chart 2015 |url=http://www.stratigraphy.org/ICSchart/ChronostratChart2015-01.pdf |publisher=International Commission on Stratigraphy |access-date=23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2016}}, the ICS describes its status as "''informal''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Concise Geologic Time Scale: 2016 | publisher=Elsevier |first=J.

Toward a "natural" Precambrian time scale}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[W. Brian Harland]] later coined an almost synonymous term, the "'''Priscoan period'''", from ''priscus'', the Latin word for "ancient".&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/priscoan Oxford Dictionary, "Priscoan"]&lt;/ref&gt; Other, older texts simply refer to the eon as the '''Pre-Archean'''.

==Etymology==
{{Life timeline}}
"Hadean" (from [[Hades]], the Greek god of the underworld, and the underworld itself) describes the hellish conditions then prevailing on Earth: the planet had just formed and was still very hot owing to its recent accretion, the abundance of short-lived radioactive elements, and frequent collisions with other Solar System bodies.

==Subdivisions&lt;!--'Paleohadean', 'Mesohadean' and 'Neohadean' redirect here--&gt;==
Since few geological traces of this eon remain on Earth, there is no official subdivision. However, the [[Lunar geologic timescale]] embraces several major divisions relating to the Hadean, so these are sometimes used in an informal sense to refer to the same periods of time on Earth.

The [[Lunar geologic timescale|Lunar divisions]] are:
* [[Pre-Nectarian]], from the formation of the [[Moon]]'s crust ({{Ma|4533}}) up to about {{Ma|3920}}
* [[Nectarian]] ranging from {{Ma|3920}} up to about {{Ma|3850}}, in a time when the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]], according to that theory, was in a stage of decline.

In 2010, an alternative scale was proposed that includes the addition of the [[Chaotian (geology)|Chaotian]] and Prenephelean Eons preceding the Hadean, and divides the Hadean into three eras with two periods each. The Paleohadean era consists of the Hephaestean ({{Gigaannum|4.5|4.4}}) and the Jacobian periods ({{Gigaannum|4.4|4.3}}).  The Mesohadean is divided into the Canadian ({{Gigaannum|4.3|4.2}}) and the Procrustean periods ({{Gigaannum|4.2|4.1}}). The Neohadean is divided into the Acastan ({{Gigaannum|4.1|4.0}}) and the Promethean periods ({{Gigaannum|4.0|3.9}}).&lt;ref name="Goldblatt10"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100036717_2010036774.pdf |work=Solid Earth |title=The eons of Chaos and Hades |date=26 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2017|02}}, this has not been adopted by the [[IUGS]].

==Hadean rocks==

==Atmosphere and oceans==
A sizeable quantity of [[water]] would have been in the material that formed the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Michael J. |last=Drake |year=2005 |title=Origin of water in the terrestrial planets |journal=Meteoritics &amp; Planetary Science |volume=40 |issue=4 |pages=515–656 |url=http://cfcc.edu/martech/courses/msc160/Readings/Drake2005.pdf |bibcode=2005M&amp;PS...40..515J |doi=10.1111/j.1945-5100.2005.tb00958.x |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009044640/http://cfcc.edu/martech/courses/msc160/Readings/Drake2005.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-09 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Water molecules would have escaped Earth's gravity more easily when it was less massive during its formation. Hydrogen and helium are expected to continually escape (even to the present day) due to [[atmospheric escape]].

Part of the ancient planet is theorized to have been disrupted by the [[giant impact hypothesis|impact that created the Moon]], which should have caused melting of one or two large regions of the Earth. Earth's present composition suggests that there was not complete remelting as it is difficult to completely melt and mix huge rock masses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/scitech/display.cfm?ST_ID=446 Solar System Exploration: Science &amp; Technology: Science Features: View Feature]&lt;/ref&gt; However, a fair fraction of material should have been vaporized by this impact, creating a ''rock vapor atmosphere'' around the young planet. The rock vapor would have condensed within two thousand years, leaving behind hot volatiles which probably resulted in a heavy {{chem|link=carbon dioxide|CO|2}} atmosphere with [[hydrogen]] and [[water vapor]]. Liquid water oceans existed despite the surface temperature of {{convert|230|C|F|abbr=on}} because at an atmospheric pressure of above 27 atmospheres, caused by the heavy {{chem|CO|2}} atmosphere, water is still liquid. As cooling continued, subduction and dissolving in ocean water removed most {{chem|CO|2}} from the atmosphere but levels oscillated wildly as new surface and mantle cycles appeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=N.

If this is true, the time when Earth finished its transition from having a hot, molten surface and atmosphere full of carbon dioxide, to being very much like it is today, can be roughly dated to about 4.0 billion years ago. The actions of plate tectonics and the oceans trapped vast amounts of carbon dioxide, thereby reducing the greenhouse effect and leading to a much cooler surface temperature and the formation of solid rock, and possibly even life.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;&lt;ref name="AramovMojzsis08"/&gt;

A '''hypergiant''' ([[stellar classification#Yerkes spectral classification|luminosity class]] '''0''' or '''Ia&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;''')&lt;!-- note: luminosity class 0 (zero), not O (oh) --&gt; is among the very rare kinds of [[star|stars]] that typically show tremendous [[luminosity|luminosities]] and very high rates of mass loss by [[stellar wind|stellar winds]]. The term ''hypergiant'' is defined as [[stellar classification|luminosity class]] 0 (zero) in the MKK system. However, this is rarely seen in the literature or in published spectral classifications, except for specific well-defined groups such as the [[yellow hypergiant]]s, RSG (red supergiants), or blue B(e) supergiants with emission spectra. More commonly, hypergiants may be classed as Ia-0 or Ia&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, but red supergiants are rarely assigned these spectral classifications. Astronomers are mostly interested in these stars because they relate to understanding stellar evolution, especially with star formation, stability, and their expected demise as [[supernova|supernovae]].

==Origin and definition==
In 1956, the astronomers [[Michael William Feast|Feast]] and [[A. David Thackeray|Thackeray]] used the term ''super-supergiant'' (later changed into hypergiant) for stars with an [[absolute magnitude]] brighter than ''M''&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; = −7 (''M''&lt;sub&gt;Bol&lt;/sub&gt; will be larger for very cool and very hot stars, for example at least −9.7 for a B0 hypergiant). In 1971, [[Philip Childs Keenan|Keenan]] suggested that the term would be used only for [[supergiant]]s showing at least one broad emission component in [[H-alpha|Hα]], indicating an extended stellar atmosphere or a relatively large mass loss rate. The Keenan criterion is the one most commonly used by scientists today.&lt;ref&gt;

Observation of a highly luminous star is insufficient for it to be defined as a hypergiant. That requires the detection of the spectral signatures of atmospheric instability and high mass loss. So it is quite possible for non-hypergiant supergiant stars to have the same or higher luminosity as a hypergiant of the same spectral class. Additionally, hypergiants are expected to have characteristic broadening and red-shifting of their spectral lines producing a distinctive shape known as a [[P_Cygni#P Cygni Profile|P Cygni profile]]. The use of hydrogen emission is not helpful for defining the coolest hypergiants, and these are largely classified on luminosity since mass loss is almost inevitable for the class.

==Formation==
Stars with an initial mass above about {{Solar mass|25}} quickly move away from the main sequence and increase somewhat in luminosity to become blue supergiants. They cool and enlarge at approximately constant luminosity to become a red supergiant, then contract and increase in temperature as the outer layers are blown away. They may "bounce" backwards and forwards executing one or more "blue loops", still at a fairly steady luminosity, until they explode as a [[supernova]] or completely shed their outer layers to become a [[Wolf–Rayet star]]. Stars with an initial mass above about {{Solar mass|40}} are simply too luminous to develop a stable extended atmosphere and so they never cool sufficiently to become red supergiants. The most massive stars, especially rapidly rotating stars with enhanced convection and mixing, may skip these steps and move directly to the Wolf–Rayet stage.

This means that stars at the top of the [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram]] where hypergiants are found may be newly evolved from the main sequence and still with high mass, or much more evolved post-red supergiant stars that have lost a significant fraction of their initial mass, and these objects cannot be distinguished simply on the basis of their luminosity and temperature. High-mass stars with a high proportion of remaining hydrogen are more stable, while older stars with lower masses and a higher proportion of heavy elements have less stable atmospheres due to increased radiation pressure and decreased gravitational attraction. These are thought to be the hypergiants, near the [[Eddington luminosity|Eddington limit]] and rapidly losing mass.

The yellow hypergiants are thought to be generally post-red supergiant stars that have already lost most of their atmospheres and hydrogen. A few more stable high mass yellow supergiants with approximately the same luminosity are known and thought to be evolving towards the red supergiant phase, but these are rare as this is expected to be a rapid transition. Because yellow hypergiants are post-red supergiant stars, there is a fairly hard upper limit to their luminosity at around {{Solar luminosity|link=y|500,000–750,000}}, but blue hypergiants can be much more luminous, sometimes several million {{Solar luminosity}}.

Almost all hypergiants exhibit variations in luminosity over time due to instabilities within their interiors, but these are small except for two distinct instability regions where [[luminous blue variable]]s (LBVs) and [[yellow hypergiant]]s are found. Because of their high masses, the lifetime of a hypergiant is very short in astronomical timescales: only a few million years compared to around 10&amp;nbsp;billion years for stars like the [[Sun]]. Hypergiants are only created in the largest and densest areas of star formation and because of their short lives, only a small number are known despite their extreme luminosity that allows them to be identified even in neighbouring galaxies. The time spent in some phases such as LBVs can be as short as a few thousand years.&lt;ref name=wrgrid&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=2012A&amp;A...542A..29G |author1=Cyril Georgy |author2=Sylvia Ekström |author3=Georges Meynet |author4=Philip Massey |author5=Levesque |author6=Raphael Hirschi |author7=Patrick Eggenberger |author8=André Maeder |title=Grids of stellar models with rotation II.

As the luminosity of stars increases greatly with mass, the luminosity of hypergiants often lies very close to the [[Eddington limit]], which is the luminosity at which the radiation pressure expanding the star outward equals the force of the star's gravity collapsing the star inward. This means that the [[radiative flux]] passing through the [[photosphere]] of a hypergiant may be nearly strong enough to lift off the photosphere. Above the Eddington limit, the star would generate so much radiation that parts of its outer layers would be thrown off in massive outbursts; this would effectively restrict the star from shining at higher luminosities for longer periods.

A good candidate for hosting a continuum-driven wind is [[Eta Carinae]], one of the most massive stars ever observed. With an estimated mass of around 130 [[solar masses]] and a luminosity four million times that of the [[Sun]], astrophysicists speculate that [[Eta Carinae]] may occasionally exceed the [[Eddington limit]].&lt;ref&gt;

As opposed to line-driven [[stellar wind]]s (that is, ones driven by absorbing light from the star in huge numbers of narrow [[spectral lines]]), continuum driving does not require the presence of [[metallicity|"metallic"]] [[atoms]]&amp;nbsp;— atoms other than [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]], which have few such lines&amp;nbsp;— in the [[photosphere]]. This is important, since most massive stars also are very metal-poor, which means that the effect must work independently of the [[metallicity]]. In the same line of reasoning, the continuum driving may also contribute to an upper mass limit even for the [[Population III|first generation of stars]] right after the [[Big Bang]], which did not contain any metals at all.

Another theory to explain the massive outbursts of, for example, [[Eta Carinae]] is the idea of a deeply situated hydrodynamic explosion, blasting off parts of the star's outer layers. The idea is that the star, even at luminosities below the [[Eddington limit]], would have insufficient [[heat convection]] in the inner layers, resulting in a density inversion potentially leading to a massive explosion. The theory has, however, not been explored very much, and it is uncertain whether this really can happen.&lt;ref&gt;

Another theory associated with hypergiant stars is the potential to form a pseudo-photosphere, that is a spherical optically dense surface that is actually formed by the stellar wind rather than being the true surface of the star.  Such a pseudo-photosphere would be significantly cooler than the deeper surface below the outward-moving dense wind.  This has been hypothesized to account for the "missing" intermediate-luminosity LBVs and the presence of yellow hypergiants at approximately the same luminosity and cooler temperatures.  The yellow hypergiants are actually the LBVs having formed a pseudo-photosphere and so apparently having a lower temperature.&lt;ref name=lbv&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Vink | first1 = J.

Hypergiants are evolved, high luminosity, high-mass stars that occur in the same or similar regions of the [[HR diagram]] to stars with different classifications.  It is not  always clear whether the different classifications represent stars with different initial conditions, stars at different stages of an evolutionary track, or is just an artifact of our observations.

Some of these distinctions are not necessarily helpful in establishing relationships between different types of stars or the differences between them since they have been developed based on differing criteria and for different purposes.

Although most [[supergiant]] stars are less luminous than hypergiants of the same temperature, a few fall in the same luminosity range.  Ordinary supergiants lack the strong H emission and broadened spectral lines that indicate rapid mass loss in the hypergiants.  Lower mass supergiants do not return from the red supergiant phase, either exploding as supernovae or leaving behind a white dwarf.

[[Luminous blue variable]]s are a class of highly luminous hot stars that display characteristic spectral variation.  They often lie in a "quiescent" zone with hotter stars generally being more luminous, but periodically undergo large surface eruptions and move to a narrow zone where stars of all luminosities have approximately the same temperature, around 8,000K.  This "active" zone is near the hot edge of the unstable "void" where [[yellow hypergiant]]s are found, with some overlap.  It is not clear whether yellow hypergiants ever manage to get past the instability void to become LBVs or explode as a supernova.

Blue hypergiants are found in the same parts of the HR diagram as LBVs but do not necessarily show the LBV variations.  Some but not all LBVs show the characteristics of hypergiant spectra at least some of the time, but many authors would exclude all LBVs from the hypergiant class and treat them separately.  Blue hypergiants that do not show LBV characteristics may be progenitors of LBVs, or vice versa, or both.  Lower mass LBVs may be a transitional stage to or from cool hypergiants or are different type of object.

[[Wolf–Rayet star]]s are extremely hot stars that have lost much or all of their outer layers.  WNL is a term used for late stage (i.e. cooler) Wolf–Rayet stars with spectra dominated by nitrogen.  Although these are generally thought to be the stage reached by hypergiant stars after sufficient mass loss, it is possible that a small group of hydrogen-rich WNL stars are actually progenitors of blue hypergiants or LBVs.  These are the closely related Ofpe (O-type spectra plus H, He, and N emission lines, and other peculiarities) and WN9 (the coolest nitrogen Wolf–Rayet stars) which may be a brief intermediate stage between high mass main-sequence stars and hypergiants or LBVs.  Quiescent LBVs have been observed with WNL spectra and apparent Ofpe/WNL stars have changed to show blue hypergiant spectra.  High rotation rates cause massive stars to shed their atmospheres quickly and prevent the passage from main sequence to supergiant, so these directly become Wolf–Rayet stars.  Wolf Rayet stars, slash stars, cool slash stars (aka WN10/11), Ofpe, Of&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Of&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; stars are not considered hypergiants.  Although they are luminous and often have strong emission lines, they have characteristic spectra of their own.

== Known hypergiants ==
Hypergiants are difficult to study due to their rarity. Many hypergiants have highly variable spectra, but they are grouped here into broad spectral classes.

=== Luminous blue variables ===
Some [[luminous blue variable]]s are classified as hypergiants, during at least part of their cycle of variation:
* [[Eta Carinae]], inside the Keyhole Nebula ([[NGC 3372]]) in the southern constellation of [[Carina (constellation)|Carina]].  Eta Carinae is extremely massive, possibly as much as 120 to 150 times the mass of the Sun, and is four to five million times as luminous.  Possibly a different type of object from the LBVs, or extreme for a LBV.
* [[P Cygni]], in the northern constellation of [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]].  Prototype for the characteristic LBV spectral lines.
* [[S Doradus]], in a nearby [[galaxy]] called the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]], in the southern constellation of [[Dorado (constellation)|Dorado]]. Prototype variable, LBVs are still often called S Doradus variables.
* The [[Pistol Star]] (V4627 Sgr), near the center of the Milky Way, in the constellation of [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]].  The Pistol Star is possibly as much as 150 times more massive than the Sun, and is about 1.7 million times more luminous.  Considered a candidate LBV, but variability has not been confirmed.

The '''International Geoscience and Geoparks Programme''' ('''IGCP''') is a cooperative enterprise of [[UNESCO]] (the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) and the [[International Union of Geological Sciences]] (IUGS).

It was launched in 1972 and originally termed the ''International Geological Correlation Programme'', the source of the acronym IGCP which it retains. For decades the programme was known as the ''International Geoscience Programme''. In November 2015 the name was changed to ''International Geoscience and Geoparks Programme'' as the global geoparks were made part of the programme.

The aim of the IGCP is to facilitate research cooperation among geoscientists across frontiers and national boundaries, through joint research work, meetings and workshops. At the present time IGCP has about 400 active projects involving thousands of scientists from about 150 countries.

The '''Kalamos Island biological field station''' is a [[research station]] located in the island [[Kalamos (island)|Kalamos]], in the [[Ionian Sea]], in [[Western Greece]]. It is situated in the core of the inner Ionian marine protected area, site GR22220003 of the [[Natura 2000]] network.&lt;ref&gt;[http://natura2000.eea.europa.eu/# Natura 2000 network viewer]&lt;/ref&gt; The marine area is additionally protected under the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans of the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and contiguous Atlantic area (ACCOBAMS).&lt;ref&gt;Urgent Call by the Cetacean Alliance for the conservation of one of the last strongholds of the endangered Mediterranean common dolphin, for the conservation of Tuna and other marine megafauna, to preserve viable fish stocks and protect spawning grounds, to preserver marine biodiversity and the ecosystem services it provides and for the sustainability of fisheries in a Natura 2000 site.
[http://www.cetaceanalliance.org/call/Call_Apr2009.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
The station is a base for year-round research activities in ecology, ecosystem management and sustainability issues such as permaculture. It was created as part of the [[Kalamos and Kastos sustainable development program]] of [[Terra Sylvestris]], a [[non-governmental]] [[non profit organization]] that established the program in order to bring about sustainable development through [[rewilding (conservation biology)|rewilding]] in the area of the Island of [[Kalamos]], [[Kastos]] and adjacent smaller islands and their [[ocean|marine environment]].&lt;ref&gt;

'''Kathleen McArthur''' (1915–2000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=McArthur, Kathleen (1915 - 2000)|url=https://www.anbg.gov.au/biography/mcarthur-kathleen.html|website=Australian National Herbarium|accessdate=21 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;), was an [[Australia]]n [[natural history|naturalist]], [[writer]], [[botanical illustrator]] and [[Conservation movement|conservationist]].  She was born in [[Brisbane, Queensland]] to Catherine and Daniel Evans.  Her mother was a daughter of the Durack pastoral family, her father a co-founder of an engineering firm.  She married Malcolm McArthur in 1938 and had three children before divorcing in 1947.  From 1942 she lived at [[Caloundra]] on the [[Sunshine Coast, Queensland|Sunshine Coast]] of Queensland.&lt;ref&gt;McKay, Judith. (1997). ''Brilliant Careers: Women collectors and illustrators in Queensland'', p. 60. Queensland Museum. {{ISBN|0-7242-7693-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The environmental activist==
McArthur was a strong environmentalist and a co-founder, with [[Judith Wright]], [[David Fleay]] and Brian Clouston, of the [[Wildlife Preservation Society of Queensland]] in 1962, and served as vice-president from then until 1965.  In 1963 she founded the [[Caloundra]] branch of the society.

She was involved in several campaigns during the 1960s and 1970s to preserve landscapes threatened by economic development, including the [[Pumicestone Passage]], the [[Great Barrier Reef]] and [[Great Sandy National Park|Cooloola]].  Much campaign work was funded through her growing and selling native plants as well as through exhibitions of her wildflower paintings.  She was especially concerned for the [[Wallum]] country of south-eastern Queensland, a habitat characterised by floristically-rich coastal heath and swamps on deep sandy soils.

The spider, ''Ozicrypta mcarthurae'', was named after her for her outstanding contribution to conservation. In 1996 she was awarded an [[honorary degree|honorary]] [[doctorate]] by [[James Cook University]] of North Queensland.&lt;ref&gt;McKay, Judith. (1997). ''Brilliant Careers: Women collectors and illustrators in Queensland'', p. 61. Queensland Museum. {{ISBN|0-7242-7693-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing==
McArthur wrote a weekly column, ''Wildlife and Landscape'', for her local paper.  She also started the Lunch Hour Theatre in Caloundra, a monthly event for which she wrote scripts based on environmental, biographical and historical subjects.  Books authored (and illustrated) by McArthur include:
* 1959 – ''Queensland Wildflowers – A Selection''. Jacaranda Press: Brisbane.
* 1978 – ''Pumicestone Passage: A Living Waterway''. Bacchus Printing: Brisbane.
* 1981 – ''Bread and Dripping Days: An Australian Growing Up in the 20s''. Kangaroo Press: Kenthurst.

'''Birketts''' are the 541 English peaks described in [[Bill Birkett]]'s 1994 guidebook, ''Complete Lakeland Fells''. The author defined them as all hills within the boundary of the [[Lake District National Park]] in [[Cumbria]] which are over {{convert|1000|ft|1}} in height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hill-bagging.co.uk/Birketts.php?ct=EWM|title=The Birketts|date=2018|publisher=HillBaggingUK|quote=The Birketts are all the Lake District hills over 1,000ft as listed in Bill Birkett's Complete Lakeland Fells.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bill Birkett|title= Complete Lakeland Fells | isbn =978-0583333672 |year= 1994| publisher=Carnival}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bill Birkett's book became a popular list for [[peak bagging]] in the Lake District, along with the equally popular '''[[List of Wainwrights in the Lake District|Wainwrights]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hills-database.co.uk/database_notes.html|title=Database Notes|publisher=[[Database of British and Irish Hills]]|date=2018|quote=Such is the popularity of the English Lake District that a number of lists have emerged specifically for that region. The best known is the Wainwrights, which was almost certainly not conceived as a list. The Birketts is a more recent listing of Lake District Hills. The Wainwright Outlying Fells and the Birketts were each published as a set of walks rather than a list, but as with the Wainwrights, a tradition of climbing them has developed.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because both lists are based on historical books, unlike for example the [[Lists of mountains and hills in the British Isles#Murdos|Murdos]], their constituents remain fixed, regardless of revisions to height or other metrics.  In this regard, they are similar to the [[Scottish lowlands]], [[Lists of mountains and hills in the British Isles#Donalds|Donalds]].  The [[Long Distance Walkers Association]] maintains a register of people who have completed the Birketts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ldwa.org.uk/hillwalkers/hillwalkers.php|title=Hillwalkers' Register|publisher=[[Long Distance Walkers Association]]|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of Birkett's peaks, [[Pillar (Lake District)#Pillar Rock|Pillar Rock]], which is also classed as a [[Lists of mountains and hills in the British Isles#Nuttalls|Nuttall]], but not a Wainwright, requires climbing ropes and climbing equipment to summit.&lt;ref name="pillar"/&gt;

There are 541 Birketts, which include 209 of the 214 Wainwrights, and 59 of the 116 Wainwright Outlying Fells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hill-bagging.co.uk/Wainwrights.php|title=Wainwrights and Wainwright Outer Fells|publisher=HillBaggingUK|date=2018|quote=The Wainwrights: The Wainwrights are a list of hills appearing in the seven volumes of Alfred Wainwright's Pictorial Guides to the Lakeland Fells; the list is subjective - some of the hills are not summits at all - just prominent points at the end of a ridge or spur from a higher mountain.&lt;br&gt;The [Wainwright] Outlying Fells: Wainwright produced an additional volume entitled The Outlying Fells of Lakelands.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="boh"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hills-database.co.uk/|title=Birketts|publisher=[[Database of British and Irish Hills]]|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Birketts range from hills, such as the smallest Birkett, [[Great Stickle]], at {{convert|1001|ft|1}}, to major mountains in the British Isles, such as [[Scafell Pike]], at just over {{convert|3209|ft|1}}.&lt;ref name="boh"/&gt; While 65 of the Birketts have a prominence above {{convert|150|m|1}}, and are [[Lists of mountains and hills in the British Isles#Marilyns|Marilyns]], 159 have a prominence below {{convert|15|m|1}}, and 42 of these are below {{convert|5|m|1}}.&lt;ref name="boh"/&gt; 54 of the 514 peaks are solely Birketts, and meet no other mountain or hill classification in the British Isles.&lt;ref name="boh"/&gt;

The carbon dioxide emissions of a country are only an indicator of one [[greenhouse gas]]. For a more complete idea of how a country influences [[climate change]], gases such as [[methane]] and [[nitrous oxide]] should be taken into account. This is particularly so in [[agricultural]] economies.

Carbon dioxide emissions are also known for earlier periods. A study of a global sample of twelve countries provide estimates for {{chem|CO|2}} emissions since 1800 and explores the long-run drivers of carbon dioxide emissions by decomposing changes in carbon emissions into population, income, technological and energy mix changes.&lt;ref name="The Drivers of Long-run CO2 Emissions"&gt;Sofia Teives Henriques and Karol J.

== Dragons in Tabletop games ==
* various Great Feathered Serpent dragons, Great Eastern dragons, Great Western dragons, Great Sirrush dragons, and others in ''[[Shadowrun]]''
* various types of dragons found in the ''[[Rifts (role-playing game)|Rifts]]'' role-playing game.
* various Great Western dragons and others in ''[[Earthdawn]]''
* [[Dragon (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Dragons]] are common (especially as [[non-player characters]]) in ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' and in some [[fantasy]] [[role-playing video game]]s. They, like many other dragons in modern culture, run the full range of good, evil, and everything in between. In Dungeons and Dragons the color of the dragon shows if it is evil or good. Metallic dragons are forces of good and they are led by the mighty dragon-god Bahamut. Chromatic dragons are evil creatures ranging from white (the weakest) to the mighty red (the strongest). The chromatic dragons revere Tiamat, a five-headed dragon-god with heads of each color of evil dragon (red, blue, green, white, black).

=== Dragons in card games ===
Fantasy card games often feature dragons, often many of them, and thus this sub-section only mentions the more popular or important ones.

====[[Magic: The Gathering]]====
Dragon is a creature subtype in [[Magic: The Gathering]].
* The Primeval Dragons in the ''[[Invasion (Magic: The Gathering)|Invasion]]'' block, namely Crosis, the Purger; Darigaaz, the Igniter; Dromar, the Banisher; Rith, the Awakener and Treva, the Renewer
* The Elder Dragon Legends from the ''[[Legends (Magic: The Gathering)|Legends]]'' block, namely Arcades Sabboth, Chromium, Nicol Bolas, Palladia-Mors and Vaevictis Asmadi
* Draco, an extremely powerful artifact dragon, that has the highest mana cost in the game (16 colorless mana).
* Rorix Bladewing, a Shivan dragon who fights in the Otarian Grand Coliseum to reclaim his nation's honor: upon his death, Rorix is reincarnated as a "[[dracolich]]", under the name Bladewing the Risen.
* The Guardian Ryuu of Kamigawa, including Jugan, the Rising Star; Keiga, the Tide Star; Kokusho, the Evening Star; Ryusei, the Falling Star; and Yosei, the Morning Star.
* Niv-Mizzet, the insightful but short-tempered dragon wizard and leader of the Izzet guild in [[Ravnica]].
* The ''[[Planar Chaos]]'' set introduces a new cycle of legendary Dragons bearing many similarities to the Invasion cycle - Oros, the Avenger; Intet, the Dreamer; Teneb, the Harvester; Numot, the Devastator; and Vorosh, the Hunter.
* The ''[[Future Sight]]'' set contains a legendary dragon called Tarox Bladewing in its "futureshifted" sheet. Tarox is apparently the son of the above-mentioned Rorix Bladewing, and according to his flavour text, "despises his siblings as insults to his line, finding and devouring each in turn". According to the magicthegathering.com article that previewed Tarox, he wants to be just like his father Rorix - although smaller than his father, Tarox's controller can discard another Tarox from their hand to double his size, making him a far heavier hitter than Rorix.
* There are also numerous other dragons, which have appeared in almost every set and every block. The most notable such dragon is Shivan Dragon, which has appeared in all but one of the Magic Core Sets.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6579">This is a list of [[mountain]]s on [[Mars]] by height above mean [[surface level]]. The listed elevations are relative to the [[Areography|Martian datum]] (the elevation defined as zero by average martian atmospheric pressure and planet radius).  Elevation is ''not'' the height above the surrounding terrain.

*A '''mons''' (plural ''montes'') is a term used in [[astrogeology]] to name extraterrestrial mountains and may or may not be of [[volcanic]] origin.
*A '''patera''' refers to the dish-shaped depression atop a volcano that is not very high compared to its diameter.
*A '''tholus''' (pl. tholi) is the term used in astrogeology to describe a small domical mountain or hill.
*Listed mons elevation is the highest point (at 16 pixels/degree) within the feature.
*Listed patera elevation is the average elevation of the shallow dish-shaped depression (the actual 'patera') at the summit.

Notable extreme elevations on Earth and Venus are included (in '''bold''' '''''and''''' ''Italics'') for comparison, where the given elevations are relative to [[Sea level|mean sea level]].

== Incidents ==

This is not a complete list of all pipeline accidents. '''For natural gas alone''', the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), a United States Department of Transportation agency, has collected data on more than 3,200 accidents deemed serious or significant since 1987.

A "significant incident" results in any of the following consequences:
* fatality or injury requiring in-patient hospitalization
* $50,000 or more in total costs, measured in 1984 dollars
* liquid releases of five or more barrels (42 US gal/barrel)
* releases resulting in an unintentional fire or explosion

PHMSA and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) post incident data and results of investigations into accidents involving pipelines that carry a variety of products, including natural gas, oil, diesel fuel, gasoline, kerosene, jet fuel, carbon dioxide, and other substances. Occasionally pipelines are repurposed to carry different products.&lt;ref&gt;Data sets of PHMSA Pipeline Safety-Flagged Incidents for 1986-2001, 2002-2009, and 2010-2017 can be downloaded from the tab by that name on the PHMSA's Pipeline Incident Flagged Files page at https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and-statistics/pipeline/pipeline-incident-flagged-files, accessed 2018.01.10. PHMSA Corrective Action Orders are at https://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/CAO_opid_0.html. PHMSA Pipeline Failure Investigation Reports are at https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/safety-reports/pipeline-failure-investigation-reports. NTSB Pipeline Accident Reports are at https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/pipeline.aspx.&lt;/ref&gt;

* On January 2, 3 people were injured, one seriously, one home destroyed, and 50 homes were damaged in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]], when a leak gas from a gas main entered a home. Preliminary results indicate that a leak occurred at a weld seam on the gas main. Later, Oklahoma regulators filed a complaint over the failure with Oklahoma Natural Gas. The complaint alleged the utility failed to properly inspect its system following eight previous leak failures in the neighborhood going back to 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kfor.com/2016/01/06/ong-releases-cause-behind-oklahoma-city-house-explosion/#|title=Preliminary investigation: ONG releases cause behind Oklahoma City house explosion|author=|date=|work=KFOR.com|accessdate=May 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsok.com/article/5522156|title=ONG agrees to pay $1 million in fines related to Oklahoma City home explosion|date=October 12, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* On August 1, 2016, a lightning strike in rural [[Powell County, Kentucky]], impacted [[Kinder Morgan]]’s compressor station on its [[Tennessee Gas Pipeline]] system in [[Clay City, Kentucky|Clay City]]. The company's emergency shutdown system was activated and natural gas was safely vented into the air, but a fine mist of oil was spewed onto the nearby highway and land. As a precaution, the road was closed to lay down sand to absorb the lubricant. A nearby homeowner's yard, vehicles and pool were covered in the substance.&lt;ref&gt;WKYT News Staff, "Lightning strike causes mystery substance to spew in Powell Co.," August 1, 2016, at http://www.wkyt.com/content/news/EMA-Lightning-strike-causes-mystery-substance-to-spew-in-Powell-Co-388866042.html, accessed 2018.01.07.&lt;/ref&gt; The PHMSA incident listing shows property damage was $138,750.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1144">The '''National Bamboo Project of Costa Rica''' was established in 1986 with the dual aims of reducing [[deforestation]] by means of replacing [[timber]] with [[bamboo]] as a primary building material and providing low cost housing for [[Costa Rica]]'s rural poor.  By cultivating and building with an indigenous form of giant bamboo called [[Guadua]], the National Bamboo Project was able to raise thousands of new homes for the poor, benefit the environment, and advance bamboo-based building technology. 

In 1995, the National Bamboo Project was handed over to the [[FUNBAMBU Foundation]] to maintain and continue the project's mission of creating low-cost bamboo housing.

'''Pola''' is a [[bull]]-respecting festival celebrated by farmers mainly in the Indian state of [[Chhattisgarh]]  and [[Maharashtra]],Northern parts of [[Telangana]] as Polala Amavasya (పొలాల అమావాస్య). On the day of Pola, the farmers decorate and respect their bulls. Pola falls on the day of the ''Pithori [[Amavasya]]'' (the new moon day) in the month of [[Shravana]] (usually in August).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Celebrations ==
Pola is mainly a farmer's festival, wherein farmers respect their bulls and oxe, to thank them for their support in farming. It occurs after the monsoon sowing and field work, typically in late August or early September. On the day of Pola, the bulls are first given a bath, and then decorated with ornaments and shawls. Their horns are painted, and their necks are adorned with garlands of flowers. The bulls do not work that day, and they are part of procession where farmers celebrate the crop season.

The work of decorated bulls, accompanied by the music and dancing, are carried out in the evenings. The first bullock to go out is an old bullock with a wooden frame (called ''makhar'') tied on its horns. This bullock is made to break a rope of mango leaves stretched between two posts, and is followed by all the other cattle in the village.

The festival is found among Marathas in central and eastern Maharashtra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Balfour|title=The Cyclopædia of India and of Eastern and Southern Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iU0OAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA241|year=1885|publisher=B. Quaritch|page=241}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar festival is observed by Hindus in other parts of India, and is called ''Mattu Pongal'' in south and ''Godhan'' in north and west India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Usha Sharma|title=Festivals In Indian Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z6OYRUEAF7oC&amp;pg=PA77|year=2008|publisher=Mittal Publications|isbn=978-81-8324-113-7|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Rydberg polaron''' is an exotic state of matter, created at low temperatures, in which a very large atom contains other ordinary atoms in the space between the nucleus and the electrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://phys.org/news/2018-02-creation-rydberg-polarons-bose-gas.html |title=Researchers report the creation of Rydberg polarons in a Bose gas|author= |date= |website=Phys.org |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the formation of this atom, scientists had to combine two fields of atomic physics: [[Bose-Einstein condensate]]s and [[Rydberg atom]]s. Rydberg atoms are formed by exciting a single atom into a high-energy state, in which the electron is very far from the nucleus. Bose-Einstein condensates are a state of matter that is produced at temperatures close to absolute zero. 

Polarons are induced by using a laser to excite Rydberg atoms contained as impurities in a Bose-Einstein condensate. In those Rydberg atoms, the average distance between the electron and its nucleus can be as large as several hundred nanometres, which is more than a thousand times the radius of a hydrogen atom.&lt;ref name="sciencealert"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencealert.com/exotic-new-matter-rydberg-polaron-molecule-bose-einstein-condensate |title=Physicists Just Stuffed an Atom Full of Atoms And Created a Brand New State of Matter  |author= |date=27 February 2018 |website=Science Alert |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under that circumstances, the distance between the nucleus and the electron of the excited Rydberg atoms is higher than the average distance of the atoms of the condensate. As a result, some atoms lie inside the orbit of the Rydberg atom's electron. 

As the atoms don't have an electric charge, they only produce a minimal force on the electron. However, the electron is slightly scattered at the neutral atoms, without even leaving its orbit, and the weak bond that is generated between the Rydberg atom and the atoms inside of it, tying them together, is known as the Rydberg Polaron.

The '''Sahara Desert [[ecoregion]]''', as defined by the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF), includes the hyper-arid center of the [[Sahara]], between 18° and 30° N.&lt;ref name=WWF/&gt; It is one of several [[deserts and xeric shrublands|desert and xeric shrubland]] ecoregions that cover the northern portion of the [[Africa]]n continent.

==Setting==
The [[Sahara Desert]] is the world's largest hot desert, located in [[North Africa]]. It stretches from the [[Red Sea]] to the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The vast desert encompasses several ecologically distinct regions. The Sahara Desert ecoregion covers an area of {{convert|4,619,260|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} in the hot, hyper-arid center of the Sahara, surrounded on the north, south, east, and west by desert ecoregions with higher rainfall and more vegetation.&lt;ref name=WWF/&gt;

The [[North Saharan steppe and woodlands]] ecoregion lies to the north and west, bordering the [[Mediterranean climate]] regions of Africa's [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and [[North Atlantic]] coasts. The North Saharan steppe and woodlands receives more regular winter rainfall than the Sahara Desert ecoregion. The [[South Saharan steppe and woodlands]] ecoregion lies to the south, between the Sahara Desert ecoregion and the [[Sahel]] grasslands. The South Saharan steppe and woodlands receives most of its annual rainfall during the summer. The Red Sea coastal desert lies in the coastal strip between the Sahara Desert ecoregion and the [[Red Sea]].

Some mountain ranges rise up from the desert and receive more rainfall and cooler temperatures. These Saharan mountains are home to two distinct ecoregions; the [[West Saharan montane xeric woodlands]] in the [[Ahaggar]], [[Tassili n'Ajjer]], [[Aïr]], and other ranges in the western and central Sahara Desert, and the [[Tibesti-Jebel Uweinat montane xeric woodlands]] in the [[Tibesti]] and [[Jebel Uweinat]] of the eastern Sahara.
[[File:Oasis in Lybia.JPG|thumb|left|Ubari Oasis in Libya]]
The surface of the desert ranges from large areas of sand dunes ([[Erg (landform)|erg]]), to stone plateaus ([[hamada]]s), gravel plains ([[Desert pavement|reg]]), dry valleys ([[wadi]]s), and salt flats. The only permanent river that crosses the ecoregion is the [[Nile River]], which originates in central Africa and empties northwards into the Mediterranean Sea. Some areas encompass vast underground aquifers resulting in [[oasis|oases]], while other regions severely lack water reserves.
{{clear left}}

===Climate===
The Sahara Desert features a [[hot desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BWh''). The Sahara Desert is one of the driest and hottest regions of the world, with a mean temperature sometimes over {{convert|30|C|F}} and the average high temperatures in summer are over {{convert|40|C|F}} for months at a time, and can even soar to {{convert|47|C|F}}. In desert rocky mountains such as the [[Tibesti]] in Libya or the [[Hoggar]] in Algeria, average highs in summer are slightly moderated by the high elevation and are between {{convert|35|and|42|C|F}} at {{convert|1,000|to|1,500|m|ft}} elevation. Daily variations may also be extreme: a swing from {{convert|37.5|to|-0.5|C|F|0}} has been observed.&lt;ref name=WWF&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=pa1327|name=Sahara Desert|accessdate=2011-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical temperature swings are between {{convert|15|and|20|C-change|F-change}}.

Precipitation in the Sahara Desert is scarce, as the whole desert generally receives less than {{convert|100|mm|in}} of rain per year except on the northernmost and southernmost edge as well as in the highest desert mountains. More than half of the desert area is hyper-arid and virtually rainless, with an average annual precipitation below {{convert|50|mm|in}} and many consecutive years may pass without any rainfall. The south of the Sahara Desert, along the boundary with the [[hot semi-arid climate]] (''BSh'') of the [[Sahel]], receives most of its annual rainfall during the highest-sun months (summer) when the [[Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone]] moves up from the south.&lt;ref name=WWF/&gt; [[Windstorm|Wind-]] and [[sandstorm]]s occur in early spring. Local inhabitants protect themselves from the heat, the sunshine, the dry air, the high diurnal temperature ranges and the sometimes dusty or sandy winds by covering their heads, such as the [[Tagelmust|cheche]] garment worn by [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]].

==History and conservation==
[[File:Addaxes in an area subjected to desertification.jpg|thumb|Addaxes grazing in a deserted region]]
The Sahara was one of the first regions of Africa to be farmed. Some 5,000 years ago, the area was not so arid and the vegetation might have been closer to a [[savanna]]. Previous fauna may be recognised in stone carvings. However, [[desertification]] set in around 3000 BCE, and the area became much like it is today.

The Sahara is largely undisturbed.&lt;ref name=WWF/&gt; The most degradation is found in areas where there is water, such as [[oasis|aquifer oases]] or along the desert margins where some rain usually falls most years. In these areas, animals such as [[addax]]es, [[scimitar-horned oryx]]es, and [[bustard]]s are [[over-hunting|over-hunted]] for their meat. Only one area of [[conservation ethic|conservation]] is recorded in the Sahara: the Zellaf Nature Reserve in Libya.&lt;ref name=WWF/&gt;

{{for|various man-made structures to protect from avalanches|Snow barrier (disambiguation)}}
A '''snow bridge''' is an arc across a [[crevasse]], a crack in rock, a [[Stream|creek]], or some other opening in terrain.&lt;ref&gt;Elaine Freedgood (2000) ''Victorian Writing about Risk: Imagining a Safe England in a Dangerous World'', {{ISBN|0-521-78108-6}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=VnUZ3QKII-kC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;dq=%22snow+bridge+is%22&amp;sig=kuzTUtd0Q0fB6dVlvdTzKQz-9Hg#PPA193,M1 p.193]&lt;/ref&gt; It is typically formed by snow drift, which first creates a [[cornice (climbing)|cornice]], which may gradually grow to reach the other side of the opening.

==Dangers==

A snow bridge may completely cover the opening and thus presents danger: it creates an illusion of unbroken surface while hiding the opening under a layer of snow of unknown thickness, possibly only several centimetres thick.

Snow bridges may also be formed inside a crevasse making it appear shallow.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chauvinguides.com/BernerJournal/bernerjournal1.htm Berner Oberland Haute Route Journal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813193230/http://www.chauvinguides.com/BernerJournal/bernerjournal1.htm |date=2007-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since a snow bridge is thicker and stronger at the edge of a crevasse, a fall through a bridge usually happens at some distance from the crevasse edge.&lt;ref&gt;"Mountain Operations" (1947) by United States War Department [https://books.google.com/books?id=odEsAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22snow+bridge+is%22&amp;dq=%22snow+bridge+is%22&amp;pgis=1 p. 204]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Soil salinity''' is the [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] content in the [[soil]]; the process of increasing the salt content is known as '''salinization'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://europeandcis.undp.org/WaterWiki/index.php/Soil_salinity  from "Soil salinity" in WaterWiki, the on-line Knowledge and Collaboration Tool of the Community of Practice (CoP) on Water- and UNDP-related activities in Central and South-Eastern Europe, Caucasus and Central Asia.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812161635/http://europeandcis.undp.org/WaterWiki/index.php/Soil_salinity |date=2007-08-12 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Salts occur naturally within soils and water. Salination can be caused by natural processes such as [[mineral weathering]] or by the gradual withdrawal of an ocean. It can also come about through artificial processes such as [[irrigation]] and [[Sodium_chloride#Road_salt|road salt]].

==Natural occurrence==
[[Salt]]s are a natural component in soils and water.
The [[ion]]s responsible for salination are: Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;
As the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (sodium) predominates, soils can become '''sodic'''.  [[Sodic soil]]s present particular challenges because they tend to have very poor structure which limits or prevents [[water infiltration]] and drainage.

Over long periods of time, as soil minerals [[weathering|weather]] and release salts, these salts are flushed or leached out of the soil by drainage water in areas with sufficient precipitation.  In addition to mineral weathering, salts are also deposited via dust and precipitation.  In dry regions salts may accumulate, leading to naturally saline soils.  This is the case, for example, in [[Salinity in Australia|large parts of Australia]]. Human practices can increase the salinity of soils by the addition of salts in irrigation water.  Proper irrigation management can prevent salt accumulation by providing adequate drainage water to leach added salts from the soil.  Disrupting drainage patterns that provide leaching can also result in salt accumulations.  An example of this occurred in [[Egypt]] in 1970 when the [[Aswan dam|Aswan High Dam]] was built. The change in the level of [[ground water]] before the construction had enabled [[soil erosion]], which led to high concentration of salts in the water table. After the construction, the continuous high level of the water table led to the salination of the [[arable land]].

==Dry land salinity==
[[dryland salinity|Salinity in drylands]] can occur when the water table is between two and three metres from the surface of the soil.  The salts from the groundwater are raised by capillary action to the surface of the soil. This occurs when groundwater is saline (which is true in many areas), and is favored by land use practices allowing more rainwater to enter the aquifer than it could accommodate. For example, the clearing of trees for agriculture is a major reason for dryland salinity in some areas, since deep rooting of trees has been replaced by shallow rooting of annual crops.

==Salinity due to irrigation==
[[Image:Salinity from irrigation.png|thumb|400px|Rain or irrigation, in the absence of leaching, can bring salts to the surface by capillary action]]
{{Main article|Environmental impacts of irrigation}}
Salinity from [[irrigation]] can occur over time wherever irrigation occurs, since almost all water (even natural rainfall) contains some dissolved salts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = ILRI | title = Effectiveness and Social/Environmental Impacts of Irrigation Projects: a Review  | series = In: Annual Report 1988 of the International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI) | year = 1989 | pages = 18–34 | location = Wageningen, The Netherlands | url = http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/irreff.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the plants use the water, the salts are left behind in the soil and eventually begin to accumulate.  Since soil salinity makes it more difficult for plants to absorb soil moisture, these salts must be leached out of the plant root zone by applying additional water.  This water in excess of plant needs is called the [[Leaching model|leaching fraction]].  Salination from irrigation water is also greatly increased by poor [[drainage]] and [[Biosalinity|use of saline water]] for irrigating agricultural crops.

Salinity in urban areas often results from the combination of irrigation and groundwater processes. Irrigation is also now common in cities (gardens and recreation areas).

==Consequences of salinity==
The consequences of salinity are
* Detrimental effects on plant growth and yield
* Damage to infrastructure (roads, bricks, corrosion of pipes and cables)
* Reduction of water quality for users, sedimentation problems, increased leaching of metals,&lt;ref&gt;[https://phys.org/news/2018-12-saltier-waterways-dangerous-chemical-cocktails.html]&lt;/ref&gt; especially copper, cadmium, manganese and zinc.  
* [[soil erosion]] ultimately, when crops are too strongly affected by the amounts of salts.
* More energy required to desalinate

Salinity is an important [[land degradation]] problem. Soil salinity can be reduced by [[leaching (agriculture)|leaching]] soluble salts out of soil with excess irrigation water.  [[Soil salinity control]] involves [[watertable control]] and [[leaching model|flushing]] in combination with [[tile drainage]] or another form of [[Drainage system (agriculture)|subsurface drainage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Drainage Manual: A Guide to Integrating Plant, Soil, and Water Relationships for Drainage of Irrigated Lands  | year = 1993 | publisher =  Interior Dept., Bureau of Reclamation | isbn = 978-0-16-061623-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Waterlog"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.waterlog.info |title=Free articles and software on drainage of waterlogged land and soil salinity control |accessdate=2010-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A comprehensive treatment of soil salinity is available from the [[United Nations]] [[Food and Agriculture Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;Salt-Affected Soils and their Management, FAO Soils Bulletin 39 (http://www.fao.org/docrep/x5871e/x5871e00.htm)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Salt tolerance of crops==
{{see|Maas–Hoffman model|Van Genuchten–Gupta model}}
High levels of soil salinity can be tolerated if salt-tolerant plants are grown.

'''''Starsiege''''' is a [[mecha]]-style [[vehicle simulation game]] developed by [[Dynamix]] and released in 1999. ''Starsiege'' is set in the [[Metaltech: Battledrome|Metaltech]]/[[Metaltech: Earthsiege|Earthsiege]] universe, which contains its predecessors ''Earthsiege'' (1994), ''[[Battledrome]]'' (1995), and ''[[Earthsiege 2]]'' (1996). This universe also includes action game ''[[Hunter Hunted (game)|Hunter Hunted]]'' (1996),{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} strategy games ''[[Mission Force: Cyberstorm]]'' (1997) and ''[[Cyberstorm 2: Corporate Wars]]'' (1998). It also includes the [[#Sequels|sequels]] ''[[Starsiege: Tribes]]'' (actually released before ''Starsiege'') and all subsequent ''[[Tribes (series)|Tribes]]'' titles. In 2015, this game and the rest of the ''Metaltech/Tribes'' series were released as [[freeware]] by [[Hi-Rez Studios]], but Battledrome and the Cyberstorm series were not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/hi-rez-makes-previous-tribes-games-free/ |title=Hi-Rez makes previous Tribes games free |last=Sykes |first=Tom |date=October 30, 2015 |work=[[PC Gamer]] |publisher=[[Future plc]] |accessdate=October 30, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151030184042/http://www.pcgamer.com/hi-rez-makes-previous-tribes-games-free/ |archivedate=October 30, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
{{see also|Metaltech: Earthsiege#Story|Earthsiege_2#Story}}
''Starsiege'' takes place in the 29th century, portraying the conflict between humanity and the [[artificial intelligence|artificially intelligent]] Cybrid war machines. Played out in various locations throughout the solar system, the story examines both civil unrest in the colonies and an all-or-nothing genocidal invasion by the machines. Bipedal [[mecha]] known as HERCs are the mainstay of ground-based combat, and the focus of gameplay.

Humanity is nominally united in an interplanetary Empire, led from Earth by the Immortal Emperor Solomon Petresun. Petresun's policy is the defence of Earth at all costs. While Earth is prosperous and well protected, the colonies on Luna, Mars, and Venus suffer from increasingly harsh regulations and production quotas. The combat units of the Empire are represented by the Imperial Police, Terran Defense Force and the Imperial Knights. The former paramilitary group is responsible for maintaining order in the colonies. The Terran Defense Force are the standard military with bases from [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] to [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]. The Knights, led by Grand Master Caanon Weathers, are the military's elite and are provided with the best pilots and equipment.

The inequality between the colonies and Earth foments rebellion. In 2802 there are two guerilla movements on Mars, one that concentrates on destroying and capturing Imperial infrastructure and supplies and another bent on killing Imperial personnel and sympathizers. Both groups operate from underground bases and make do with modified mining HERCs and tanks. The rebels partially offset their disadvantages with superior weapons taken from the alien "Tharsis Cache"; an underground stockpile of alien technology discovered by rebels while digging new tunnels. Eventually the rebellion becomes too great for the police to contain and the Knights are deployed to Mars to crush the insurrection.

The Cybrids are a race of sentient robots responsible for the first Earthsiege. They are led by the first Cybrid, Prometheus, who is revered with god-like status. The Cybrids established themselves in the outer solar system after being defeated two centuries before during the first Earthsiege. Since then they have built up their strength for another bid to destroy humanity and claim Earth for their own. Like the Martian rebels, the Cybrids discover their own cache of alien weapons and adapt it to use, but their cache is inferior to the Tharsis Cache.

The game offers two story campaigns, with different endings. The Human campaign puts the player in control of a Martian rebel, initially fighting the Empire before humanity unites against the Cybrid invasion midway through the campaign. The human campaign culminates in an attack on Prometheus on Pluto. The Cybrid campaign starts with their invasion across the outer colonies and proceeds to Earth, ending in an assault on the Imperial palace to kill Petresun.

==Gameplay==
As a simulation, ''Starsiege'' offers players the ability to pilot a wide variety of massive bipedal war machines known as ''[[HERCULAN]]''s (Humaniform-Emulation Roboticized Combat Unit with Leg-Articulated Navigation) (or 'HERCs' for short), as well as several [[tanks]]. Set in 2829, ''Starsiege'' contains an array of advanced technology, and numerous upgrades are available for each vehicle. ''Starsiege'' takes place across a number of planets and moons in the solar system, offering a range of different locations throughout the game and in multiplayer battles, including Earth, Titan, Luna, Mars, Venus, and Mercury. There are two campaigns, Human and Cybrid.

Gameplay in ''Starsiege'' revolves around mechanized combat - piloting HERCs and tanks in combat against opposing vehicles. Both types of vehicles can be controlled via any combination of keyboard, joystick, or mouse input. Starsiege abandoned the "torso-twist" gameplay mechanic common in many mecha simulations (including preceding games in the series), a feature that would normally allow the user to swivel the HERC's upper body independently of its legs. In Starsiege, torso orientation is fixed forward, but the player can move the aiming recticle across the screen with a mouse, a feature [[GameSpot]] compared to playing a first-person shooter.&lt;ref name="gamespot.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/starsiege-review/1900-2535855/ |title=Starsiege Review |last=Kasavin |first=Greg |date=March 24, 1999 |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=July 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both campaigns, the player is eventually assigned squadmates and is able to issue basic commands to them.&lt;ref name="ign.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/04/07/starsiege |title=Starsiege |last=Blevins |first=Tal |date=April 6, 1999 |publisher=[[IGN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every vehicle has unique performance, though this can be modified somewhat through customization of parts. Tanks and HERCs both utilize armor for defense, but HERCs also can equip rechargeable shields for additional protection. Other part choices include weapons, engine, and engine boosters.&lt;ref name="ign.com"/&gt; Customizing the player's vehicle is an important element of gameplay, particularly in multiplayer - a proper balance between all of the components is necessary to assure the player a reasonable chance of success.

Multiplayer gameplay includes classic modes [[Deathmatch (gaming)|deathmatch]], team deathmatch, and [[capture the flag]].&lt;ref name="gamespot.com"/&gt;

In February 1999, Dynamix announced that it would launch ''Starsiege'' with a shipment of 250,000 units to retailers.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20010520134922/http://www.gamedaily.com/news/february_99/2_24/index.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

''Starsiege'' received "generally favorable reviews" according to the [[Review aggregator|review aggregation]] website [[GameRankings]].&lt;ref name="gr"/&gt; [[IGN]] highlighted the well presented package and cutscenes, graphically impressive (whilst sparse) landscapes, intuitive controls and the longevity of the multiplayer mode. The minimal sound effects were criticised, with muddled voice-overs, and some of human HERC models were felt to be a bit bland and generic.&lt;ref name="ign.com"/&gt; GameSpot said, "Starsiege brings new life to a genre otherwise devoid of it, even if it doesn't really succeed in elevating robot sims out of their long-term rut".&lt;ref name="gamespot.com"/&gt;

[[CNET|CNET Gamecenter]] nominated ''Starsiege'' for its 1999 "Best Sci-Fi Simulation" award, but gave the prize to ''[[MechWarrior 3]]''.&lt;ref name=gamecenter1999&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000606180348/http://gamecenter.com/Features/Exclusives/Awards99/ | url=http://gamecenter.com:80/Features/Exclusives/Awards99/ | title=The Gamecenter Awards for 1999! | author=The Gamecenter Staff | date=January 21, 2000 | archivedate=June 6, 2000 | work=[[CNET|CNET Gamecenter]] | deadurl=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequels==
The [[first-person shooters]] ''[[Starsiege: Tribes]]'' (1999; released before ''Starsiege''), ''[[Tribes 2]]'' (2001), ''[[Tribes Aerial Assault]]'' (2002), ''[[Tribes: Vengeance]]'' (2004) and ''[[Tribes: Ascend]] (2012)'' followed this game.

'''Starsiege 2845''' was a game in development from 2003&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20031106161624/http://www.starsiege2845.com/ 6 Nov 2003 archive of Starsiege2845.com]&lt;/ref&gt; to 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070311235233/http://www.starsiege2845.com/ 11 March 2007 archive of Starsiege2845.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Like the later [[Tribes Universe]] game developed in 2010-2011, it stagnated into hiatus and was not completed.

''Starsiege'' can be perceived as the bridge between the ''Earthsiege'' series and ''Tribes'' series.

In [[condensed matter physics]], a '''string-net''' is an extended object whose collective behavior has been proposed as a physical mechanism for [[topological order]] by [[Michael A. Levin]] and [[Xiao-Gang Wen]]. A particular string-net model may involve only closed loops; or networks of oriented, labeled strings obeying branching rules given by some [[gauge group]]; or still more general networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Levin, Michael A. |author2=Xiao-Gang Wen |last-author-amp=yes |title=String-net condensation: A physical mechanism for topological phases |journal=Physical Review B |volume=71 |issue=45110 |pages=21 |date=12 January 2005|arxiv=cond-mat/0404617 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.71.045110 |bibcode=2005PhRvB..71d5110L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The string-net model is claimed to show the derivation of photons, electrons, and U(1) gauge charge, small (relative to the [[Planck mass]]) but nonzero masses, and suggestions that the [[leptons]], [[quarks]], and [[gluons]]  can be modeled in the same way. In other words, string-net condensation provides a unified origin for [[photons]] and [[electrons]] (or [[gauge bosons]] and [[fermions]]). It can be viewed as an origin of [[light]] and [[electron]] (or [[gauge bosons|gauge interactions]] and [[Fermi statistics]]).
However, their model does not account for the [[chiral]] coupling between the [[fermions]] and the SU(2) [[gauge bosons]] in the [[standard model]].

For strings labeled by the positive integers, string-nets are the [[spin network]]s studied in [[loop quantum gravity]]. This has led to the proposal by Levin and Wen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Journal |title=Photons and electrons as emergent phenomena |first1=Michael |last1=Levin |first2=Xiao-Gang |last2=Wen |url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0407140.pdf |journal=Rev. Mod. Phys. |volume=77 |pages=871-879 [878] |date=2005 |quote=loop quantum gravity appears to be a string net condensation … |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.77.871 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Smolin, Markopoulou and Konopka&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |eprint=hep-th/0611197 |quote=We argue (but do not prove) that under certain conditions the spins in the system can arrange themselves in regular, lattice-like patterns at low temperatures. |first1=Tomasz |last1=Konopka |first2=Fotini |last2=Markopoulou |first3=Lee |last3=Smolin |title=Quantum Graphity |url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/0611197.pdf |date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; that loop quantum gravity's spin networks can give rise to the [[standard model]] of [[particle physics]] through this mechanism, along with [[fermi statistics]] and [[gauge bosons|gauge interactions]]. To date, a rigorous derivation from LQG's spin networks to Levin and Wen's spin lattice has yet to be done, but the project to do so is called [[Event symmetry#Quantum_graphity_and_other_random_graph_models|quantum graphity]], and in a more recent paper, Tomasz Konopka, [[Fotini Markopoulou]], [[Simone Severini]] argued that there are some similarities to spin networks (but not necessarily an exact equivalence) that gives rise to U(1) gauge charge and electrons in the string net mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Quantum graphity: A model of emergent locality |first1=Tomasz |last1=Konopka |first2=Fotini |last2=Markopoulou |first3=Simone |last3=Severini |journal=Phys.

[[Herbertsmithite]] may be an example of string-net matter.&lt;ref name=eureka&gt;{{cite web|last=Bowles|first=Claire|title=Have researchers found a new state of matter?|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2007-03/ns-hrf031407.php|publisher=Eureka Alert|accessdate=29 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=newscientist&gt;{{cite journal|last=Merali|first=Zeeya|title=The universe is a string-net liquid|journal=New Scientist|date=2007-03-17|volume=193|issue=2595|pages=8–9|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19325954.200|accessdate=29 January 2012|doi=10.1016/s0262-4079(07)60640-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Z2 spin liquid===
[[Z2 spin liquid]] obtained using [[slave-particle approach]] may be the first theoretical example of string-net liquid.&lt;ref&gt;N. Read and Subir Sachdev, Large-N expansion for frustrated quantum antiferromagnets, Phys. Rev. Lett. 66 1773 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Xiao-Gang Wen]], Mean Field Theory of Spin Liquid States with Finite Energy Gaps and Topological Orders, [http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevB.44.2664 Phys. Rev. B44, 2664 (1991)].&lt;/ref&gt;

===The toric code===
The [[toric code]] is a two dimensional spin lattice that acts as a quantum error-correcting code. It is defined on a two dimensional lattice with [[torus|toric]] [[boundary conditions]] with a spin-1/2 on each link. It can be shown that the ground state of the standard toric code Hamiltonian is an ''equal weight superposition'' of closed string states.&lt;ref name=kitaevlaumann&gt;{{Cite arXiv|last=Kitaev|first=Alexei, Y.|author2=Chris Laumann |title=Topological phases and quantum computation|date=2009|eprint=0904.2771|class=cond-mat.mes-hall}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a ground state is an example of a string-net condensate&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=Physical Review A|volume=85|issue=6|page=062328|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.85.062328|last=Morimae|first=Tomoyuki|title=Quantum computational tensor network on string-net condensate|date=2012|arxiv=1012.1000|bibcode = 2012PhRvA..85f2328M }}&lt;/ref&gt; which has the same [[topological order]]
as the [[Z2 spin liquid]] above.

'''Tropical ecology''' is the study of the relationships between the biotic and abiotic components of the tropics, or the area of the Earth that lies between the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] (23.4378° N and 23.4378° S, respectively). The tropical climate experiences hot, humid weather and rainfall year-round. While many might associate the region solely with the rainforests, the tropics are home to a wide variety of ecosystems that boast a great wealth of biodiversity, from exotic animal species to seldom-found flora. Tropical ecology began with the work of early English naturalists and eventually saw the establishment of research stations throughout the tropics devoted to exploring and documenting these exotic landscapes. The burgeoning ecological study of the tropics has led to increased conservation education and programs devoted to the climate. This climatic zone offers numerous advantages to ecologists conducting a wide array of studies, from rich biodiversity to vast lands untainted by man.

== Origins ==

The roots of tropical ecology can be traced to the voyages of European naturalists in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Men who might be considered early ecologists such as [[Alexander Von Humboldt]], [[Thomas Belt]], [[Henry Walter Bates]], and even [[Charles Darwin]] sailed to tropical locations and wrote extensively about the exotic flora and fauna they encountered. While many naturalists were simply drawn to the exotic nature of the tropics, some historians argue that the naturalists conducted their studies on tropical islands in order to increase the likelihood that their work might bring about social and political change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grove|first=Richard|title=Green Imperialism: Colonial Expansion, Tropical Island Edens and the Origins of Environmentalism, 1600-1860|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|isbn=978-0521565134|pages=309–310}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, these early explorations and the subsequent writings that came from them comprise much of the early work of tropical ecology and served to spark further interest in the tropics among other naturalists. [[Henry Walter Bates]], for example, wrote extensively about a species of toucan he encountered while traveling along the Amazon River. Bates discovered that if one toucan called out, the other surrounding toucans would mimic his or her call, and the forest would quickly fill with the sounds of toucans; this was one of the first documented studies of animal mimicry.&lt;ref name="Tropical Ecology"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kricher|first=John|title=Tropical Ecology|year=2011|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-691-11513-9|pages=7–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Von Humboldt]] voyaged throughout South America, from Venezuela through the Andes Mountains. There, Humboldt and his associate, [[Aimé Bonpland]], stumbled upon an interesting ecological concept. As the pair traveled from the base of the mountains to the peak, they noticed that the species of plants and animals would change according to which climatic zone they were in relative to their elevation. This simple discovery aided the theorization of the ''life zone concept,'' which would eventually give way to the popularization of the concept of ecosystems.&lt;ref name="Tropical Ecology"/&gt; Another voyager, [[William Beebe]], researched many species of birds in tropical locations and published a large gamut of academic works on his findings that greatly shaped the field of ornithology. According to his biographer Carol Grant Gould, "The effects William Beebe had on science... are enormous and lasting. He made an effective transition between the Victorian natural historian, content to collect and classify the natural world, and the modern experimental biologist."&lt;ref name="William Beebe"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davis Jr.|first=William|title=The Remarkable Life of William Beebe: Explorer and Naturalist|journal=The Wilson Bulletin|date=December 2005|volume=117|issue=4|pages=421–422|doi=10.1676/0043-5643(2005)117[0421:ol]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work of these early pioneers not only lead to an increased interest in the burgeoning field of tropical ecology, but also had far reaching implications for scientific study on the whole.

== Conservation and management ==
[[File:B02 Ecuador 010 - Plants of the rainforest, February 1985.jpg|thumb|upright|Tropical blossom in the Ecuadorian rainforest]]
The tropics receive a lot of attention when it comes to conservation and management due to increased public awareness of the significance of tropical ecosystems and the delicacy with which they must be treated. The rainforests are subjects of heightened attention due to the excessive deforestation and logging that occurs in those ecosystems. In the 1980s, the [[United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization]] conducted a study that concluded that 15.4 million hectares (100 acres) of tropical forest was lost per year. In addition, 5.6 million hectares were logged each year.&lt;ref name="Del Lungo 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Del Lungo|first=Alberto|title=Forest Plantation Resources, FAO Data-Sets 1980, 1990, 1995 and 2000|journal=Forest Plantations Thematic Papers|date=December 2001|volume=14|pages=36–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; This landmark study sparked widespread interest in the tropical ecosystem, and a great number of non-profits and outspoken ecologists engaged in an extended fight to "save the rainforest" that continues today. This battle has manifested itself in a number of ways, one of which is the outcropping of biodiversity institutes in tropical locations dedicated to stopping the excessive deforestation of the landscape, one of the most notable of which was established in [[Costa Rica]]. The work of the Costa Rican National Biodiversity Institute ([[INBio]]) has served as a model for other biodiversity institutes. First, it must be noted that rainforests harbor the most alkaloid-producing plants of any biome; alkaloids are compounds that are crucial to the production of Western drugs.&lt;ref name="Myers 1992"&gt;{{cite book|last=Myers|first=Norman|title=The Primary Source: Tropical Forests and Our Future|year=1992|publisher=W.W. Norton|location=New York|isbn=978-0393308280}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the abundance of these compounds, pharmaceutical companies all over the world look to the rainforests for new medicinal treatments. In the early 1990s, the heads of [[INBio]] signed a deal with the pharmaceutical behemoth Merck that called for cooperation between the two entities in discovering and exploring new natural treatments in the Costa Rican rainforests.&lt;ref name="Zebich-Knos 1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zebich-Knos|first=Michele|title=Preserving Biodiversity in Costa Rica: The Case of the Merck-INBio Agreement|journal=The Journal of Environment and Development|date=June 1997|volume=6|issue=2|pages=180–186|doi=10.1177/107049659700600206}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecologists, government officials, and corporations alike praised this decision as decisive progress in an ongoing struggle to work cooperatively in utilizing tropical biodiversity while ensuring the stability of tropical ecosystems.

== Significance of ecology in the tropics ==

It is advantageous for ecologists and naturalists to study plants, animals, and ecosystems in the tropical climate for a number of reasons. For one, the tropics are home to a wide array of ecosystems, from rainforests to deserts. In that sense, the tropics are a great place for ecologists to conduct diverse studies without traveling too far from a research center. Secondly, the temperature in the tropics rarely hinders plant growth and activity; flora can be studied nearly year round, as cold weather never stunts plant activity. In addition to climatic reasons, the traditionally sparse population of the tropics has greatly aided research in the area, as the landscape is largely untainted by mankind and machinery. While this may not be the case so much as of late, the vast amounts of untapped land in the tropics still make for prime research territory. Finally, the tropics are valuable to ecologists because they are home to some of the oldest lands on Earth, including [[Chile|Chile's]] [[Atacama Desert]] and [[Australia|Australia's]] [[Peneplain]]. Thus, plant communities have been growing and evolving for millions of uninterrupted years, which makes for interesting study.&lt;ref name="What the Tropics Can Contribute to Ecology"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Richards|first=P.W.|title=What the Tropics Can Contribute to Ecology|journal=Journal of Ecology|date=July 1963|volume=51|issue=2|pages=231–241|doi=10.2307/2257682|jstor=2257682}}&lt;/ref&gt; That being said, while it may be advantageous to study ecology in the tropics, this is not to say that it is without difficulty. The ecosystems native to the tropics and the biodiversity they boast are dwindling. Half of the species located in biodiversity hotspots are in danger of extinction, and many of the plants with potential medicinal uses are dying off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bawa|first=Kamaljit|author2=W. John Kress|author3=Nalini M. Nadkarni|last-author-amp=yes|title=Beyond Paradise: Meeting the Challenges in Tropical Biology in the 21st Century|journal=Biotropica|date=September 2004|volume=36|issue=3|page=310|doi=10.1111/j.1744-7429.2004.tb00320.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, ecological study in the tropics is not as easily conducted as it once was; this is the reason why much of the modern ecological work in the field is aimed towards conservation and management as opposed to general research.
