==History==
The idea behind Academic Earth came to Ludlow upon stumbling on a full video course lecture from MIT Mathematics Professor Gilbert Strang. Doing further research, he found out that there are various academic resources online although these resources were scattered across different websites and in varying file formats. Patterned after [[Hulu]], Academic Earth serves as an easily  accessible repository for online academic lectures.&lt;ref name=hulued /&gt; The platform is also likened to what Google was trying to do with its defunct [[Knol]] project,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2009/02/how_to_go_to_harvard_for_free.html|title=How To Go to Harvard for Free|last=Manjoo|first=Farhad|date=2009-02-19|work=Slate|access-date=2018-09-27|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339}}&lt;/ref&gt; which aggregated scholarly articles. It was launched two days before [[YouTube]] introduced its own YouTube EDU service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Meconomy: How to Reinvent Ourselves for the Future of Work|last=Albers|first=Markus|publisher=epubli GmbH|year=2010|isbn=9783869318868|location=Berlin|pages=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://lifehacker.com/5185679/youtube-edu-brings-free-education-to-the-masses|title=YouTube EDU Brings Free Education to the Masses|last=Pash|first=Adam|work=Lifehacker|access-date=2018-09-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The website also offers online courses but unlike their formal versions, Academic Earth only publishes sorted video courses and sends users to the academic institutions offering them if they wish to complete it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.tesol.org/academic-earth-free-education-for-all/|title=Academic Earth: Free Education for All|last=Arntsen|first=Tara|date=October 28, 2004|website=TESOL International Association|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants also have little interaction with educators and with each other.

On January 10, 2012, it was announced that Academic Earth has been acquired by [[Ampush]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ampushmedia.com/news.html|title=Ampush Media: News|accessdate=2012-01-26

'''Asian American Studies''' is an academic discipline which critically examines the history, experiences, culture, and policies relevant to [[Asian Americans]]. It is closely related to other [[Ethnic Studies]] disciplines, such as [[African American Studies]], [[Latino/a Studies]], and [[Native American Studies]]. 

==History==
Asian American Studies appeared as a field of intellectual inquiry in the late 1960s&lt;ref&gt;Shirley Hune. "Expanding the International Dimension of Asian American Studies". Amerasia Journal, Vol. 15 No. 2 (1989), pp.xix&lt;/ref&gt; as a result of strikes by the Third World Liberation Front, a group of students of color at [[San Francisco State University]] and at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], which demanded that college classroom instruction include the histories of people of color in the United States told from their perspectives. The demand for Ethnic Studies was a critical response to the Eurocentric bias in university curriculum. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fiel |first=Crystal |date=March 8, 2009 |title=Celebration 40 Years: Third World Liberation Front |url=http://magandamagazine.wordpress.com/2009/03/08/celebrating-40-years-third-world-liberation-front/ |journal={m}aganda magazine |publisher=University of California, Berkeley |accessdate=9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, a College of Ethnic Studies (the only such "college" at any American university at the time) became established at San Francisco State University with American Indian Studies, Asian American Studies, Africana Studies, and Latino/a Studies as its four units,&lt;ref&gt;San Francisco State University: Asian American Studies. &lt;http://www.sfsu.edu/~aas/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and four ethnic studies programs became established at the University of California, Berkeley. The [[Association for Asian American Studies]], a professional organization designed to promote teaching and research in the field, was established in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ABOUT {{!}} Association for Asian American Studies|url = http://aaastudies.org/about/|website = aaastudies.org|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Topics in Asian American Studies==
Drawing from numerous disciplines such as [[sociology]], [[history]], [[literature]], [[political science]], and [[gender studies]], Asian American Studies scholars consider a variety of perspectives and employ diverse analytical tools in their work. Unlike "Asian" Studies which focuses on the history, culture, religion, etc. of Asian people living in Asia, Asian American Studies is interested in the history, culture, experiences, of Asians living in the United States.

Academic programs in Asian American Studies provide students with the opportunity to examine the history of Asian-Americans, which includes topics such as immigration and race-based exclusion policies.&lt;ref&gt;L. Ling-Chi Wang. "Asian American Studies" American Quarterly Vol. 33, No. 3 (1981), pp. 339-354&lt;/ref&gt; 

Asian American Studies provides an academic avenue for addressing issues of racial oppression, capitalism at home, and imperialism abroad.&lt;ref&gt;L. Ling-Chi Wang. "Asian American Studies" American Quarterly Vol. 33, No. 3 (1981), pp. 339-354&lt;/ref&gt; 

The discourse also includes studies on how [[Immigrant generation|first- and second-generation]] Asian Americans deal with adjustment and assimilation, especially on their Americanization and aggressive pursuit of higher education and prestigious occupations in a society that still discriminates against them.&lt;ref&gt;L. Ling-Chi Wang. "Asian American Studies" American Quarterly Vol. 33, No. 3 (1981), pp. 339-354&lt;/ref&gt;

Asian American Studies focuses on the identities, historical and contemporary experiences of individuals and groups in the United States. Concepts and issues that are crucial to this interdisciplinary curriculum include: [[Orientalism]], diaspora, Asian American masculinity, Asian American femininity, cultural politics, and media representation.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

==Major Programs and Departments==
Major Asian American Studies programs in California include those at [[UC Berkeley]], [[UC San Diego]], [[UC Santa Barbara]], [[UC Irvine]],  [[UC Davis]], [[San Francisco State University]] (SFSU), [[California State University, Long Beach]], [[California State University, Northridge]], [[California State University, Fullerton]], [[City College of San Francisco]], [[University of Southern California]], [[The Claremont Colleges]], and at [[UCLA]].

Outside of California, major programs include [[University of Washington]], [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], University of Maryland, College Park, [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]], [http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/aasp/welcome-page Hunter College], [[Cornell University]], [[Binghamton University]], Duke University and [[Columbia University]]. Other rising programs include [[Arizona State University]], [[New York University]], [[Northwestern University]], [[University of Pennsylvania]] and [[University of Minnesota]]. Currently, several universities, including [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]], [[University of Virginia]], [[Syracuse University]], and many others are in the process of developing Asian American Studies departments. 

Master of Arts in Asian American Studies programs are available at UCLA and SFSU.

At the time of its founding in 1987, the Asian American Studies Program at [[Cornell University]] was the first such program in the Ivy League and on the east coast. Today it has four core faculty members in the humanities and social sciences in a variety of departments and colleges. This cross-college, university-wide position accommodates the extensive teaching and research interests of the Program's faculty and reflects the breadth of the vibrant field of Asian American Studies in general. In the classroom, in scholarship, and through campus and community advocacy, the Program is committed to examining the histories and experiences; identities, social and community formations; politics; and contemporary concerns of people of Asian ancestry in the United States and other parts of the Americas.

On the East Coast, the [[State University of New York at Stony Brook]] created an Asian &amp; Asian American Studies Department after a 52 million dollar donation by Charles B. Wang (the founder of Computer Associates). The Charles B. Wang Center is designed as a vital space for multi-disciplinary and multicultural dialogues. The {{convert|120000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} building was officially presented to Stony Brook University by Charles B. Wang on October 22, 2002. It was the largest single private gift ever received by the State University of New York 64-campus system. The Wang Center is used for conferences, art exhibits, film festivals, lectures, seminars, and performances. It is open to all Stony Brook students, faculty, and staff as well as the surrounding community.

[[Hunter College, City University of New York]], located in the [[Upper East Side]] in [[Manhattan]] is home to the only Asian American Studies Program in the [[CUNY]] system. The program was established in 1993 through student and faculty activism, with Peter Kwong as the inaugural director. Despite offering the largest number of Asian American Studies courses in [[New York City]], [[Hunter College]] does not have an Asian American Studies department nor does it offer an Asian American Studies major. In 2006, when the program was under threat of being cut, student activists formed [[The Coalition for the Revitalization of Asian American Studies at Hunter]] to fight to keep Asian American Studies. The students succeeded in saving the minor program, and they continue to fight for an Asian American Studies major and department. 

[[Queens College, City University of New York]], located in the neighborhood of [[Flushing, Queens|Flushing]] in [[New York City]], is home to the [https://www.qc.cuny.edu/academics/centers/asian/Pages/homepage.aspx Asian/American Center]. It was established to conduct research with community needs in mind. It serves as a hub for research into Asian American issues, particularly focusing on the Asian diaspora in the New York area, and offers a minor in Asian American Community Studies (AACS).

'''Castleberry Hill''' is a neighborhood in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], adjacent to and southwest of [[Downtown Atlanta]]. It is a federally recognized [[Historic districts in the United States|historic district]] since 1985 and became a [[List of historic buildings and districts designated by the City of Atlanta|City of Atlanta Landmark District]] in 2006. Since 2000, the area has experienced an influx of residents and new businesses. The area, which is made up predominantly of Walker, Nelson and Peters Streets is home to a growing number of small art galleries, restaurants, coffee shops, and loft residences. Less than a mile from the historically black colleges and universities that make up the [[Atlanta University Center]] Consortium and from the expansive downtown campus of [[Georgia State University]], the area also offers local shopping as well as spa services, like [http://iwifresh.com iwi Fresh]. Other notable area eateries include [http://www.nomascantina.com No Mas! Cantina], a spacious Mexican-themed restaurant, bar and fine home furnishings establishment, often used as a point of reference.  Castleberry Hill residents gather at local watering holes, such as [http://www.elliottstreet.com Elliott Street Pub] and [http://www.bottlerocketatl.com Bottle Rocket].

==History==
The area in the city limits of Atlanta known today as Castleberry Hill was originally part of the renegade [[Jonathan Norcross|Snake Nation]] community that functioned during the 1850s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atlantamagazine.com/crime-city/the-most-lawless-year-in-atlantas-history/|title=The most lawless year in Atlanta's history - Atlanta Magazine|date=15 May 2014|website=Atlantamagazine.com|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://pecannelog.com/2009/07/01/breaking-news-atlantas-seedy-past-2// |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-02-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208092708/http://pecannelog.com/2009/07/01/breaking-news-atlantas-seedy-past-2/ |archive-date=2015-02-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to an article from Atlanta Magazine,&lt;ref name="Atlanta's Street Names 2009, p. 64"&gt;"Who the Heck Was Juan Ponce de Leon?: The Stories behind Atlanta's Street Names," Atlanta Magazine, March 2009, Vol. 48, Issue 11, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; Castleberry Hill was, by the mid-nineteenth century, a red-light district filled with prostitutes, gambling, and cockfighting.  By the time the Civil War began, however, this area was in the process of industrialization.  Items such as terra cotta and other building materials were produced then in Atlanta factories.  Additionally, Castleberry Hill then contained cotton warehousing and grocers.  One of those grocers was Daniel Castleberry, for whom the area was named.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.castleberryhill.org/history.php Castleberry Hill History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216161223/http://www.castleberryhill.org/history.php |date=2009-02-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Castleberry, however, is believed to have been an established businessman in the area as a result of his winning the land in 1821 in a Georgia land lottery.&lt;ref name="Atlanta's Street Names 2009, p. 64"/&gt; By the early 1990s, the area had fallen on hard times, serving as the backdrop for [[dystopic]] films such as [[Freejack]] and [[Kalifornia]].  Loft conversions began in the 1980s, and by 1992, there were 120 lofts with 150 residents. The [[Olympic Games: Atlanta 1996|1996 Olympics]] saw another influx of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE0DD1430F935A15752C0A964958260 | work=The New York Times | title=FOCUS; Loft-Living, Southern Style, Catching On | first=Ford | last=Risley | date=1992-01-26 | accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 21st century, however, Castleberry Hill began another renaissance with major motion pictures and TV series such as [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1520211/?ref_=nv_sr_1'The Walking Dead'] being filmed in the area; the now well-known Castleberry Hill Art Stroll, which is held on the second Friday of each month, has become yet another popular event in this area.&lt;ref&gt;"Downtown's Colorful Communities," Atlanta Magazine, Oct. 2014, Vol. 54, Issue 6, p. 120-121&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chukchi''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|ʊ|k|tʃ|iː}}&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Bauer, 2007, ''The Linguistics Student’s Handbook'', Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages|Chukotko–Kamchatkan language]] spoken by the [[Chukchi people]] in the easternmost extremity of [[Siberia]], mainly in [[Chukotka Autonomous Okrug]]. According to the [[Russian Census (2002)|Russian Census of 2002]], about 7,700 of the 15,700 Chukchi people speak Chukchi; knowledge of the Chukchi language is decreasing, and most Chukchi now speak the [[Russian language]] (fewer than 500 report not speaking Russian at all).

The language is closely related to [[Koryak language|Koryak]]. Chukchi, Koryak, [[Kerek language|Kerek]], [[Alutor language|Alutor]], and [[Itelmen language|Itelmen]], form the Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages [[Language families and languages|language family]]. There are many cultural similarities between the Chukchis and [[Koryaks]], including economies based on [[reindeer herding]].  Both peoples refer to themselves by the endonym '''''Luorawetlat''''' (''‘ԓыгъоравэтԓьат’'' {{IPA|[ɬəɣʔorawetɬʔat]}}; singular '''''Luorawetlan''''' – ''‘ԓыгъоравэтԓьан’'' {{IPA|[ɬəɣʔorawetɬʔan]}}), meaning "the real people".  All of these peoples and other unrelated minorities in and around Kamchatka are known collectively as [[Kamchadals]].

''Chukchi'' and ''Chukchee'' are [[anglicisation|anglicized]] versions of the [[Russian language|Russian]] exonym ''Chukcha'' (plural ''Chukchi''). This came into Russian from ''Čävča'', the term used by the Chukchis' [[Tungusic languages|Tungusic]]-speaking neighbors, itself a rendering of the Chukchi word ''‘чавчыв’'' {{IPA-xx|tʃawtʃəw|}}, which in Chukchi means "a man who is rich in reindeer".

In the [[UNESCO]] [[Red Book of Endangered Languages|Red Book]], the language is on the [[List of endangered languages|list of]] [[endangered language]]s.

== Scope ==
Many Chukchis use the language as their primary means of communication both within the family and while engaged in their traditional pastoral economic activity (reindeer herding). The language is also used in media (including [[radio]] and [[TV]] translations) and some [[business]] activities. However, Russian is increasingly used as the primary means of business and administrative communication, in addition to behaving as a [[lingua franca]] in territories inhabited by non-Chukchis such as Koryaks and Yakuts. Over the past few decades, fewer and fewer Chukchi children have been learning Chukchi as a native language. Almost all Chukchis speak Russian, although some have a lesser command than others. Chukchi language is used as a primary language of instruction in [[elementary school]]; the rest of secondary education is done in Russian with Chukchi taught as a subject.

A Chukchi writer, [[Yuri Rytkheu]] (1930–2008), has earned a measure of renown in both Russia and Western Europe, although much of his published work was written in Russian, rather than Chukchi.

== Orthography ==
[[File:Chukchi textbook cover.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The cover of a Grade 5 Chukchi language textbook from 1996, illustrating the then new [[El with hook|Cyrillic L with hook]] letter]]

Until 1931, the Chukchi language had no official orthography, in spite of attempts in the 1800s to write religious texts in it.

At the beginning of the 1900s, [[Vladimir Bogoraz]] discovered specimens of pictographic writing by the Chukchi herdsman [[Tenevil]] (see [[:ru:File:Luoravetl.jpg]]). Tenevil's writing system was his own invention, and was never used beyond his camp. The first official Chukchi alphabet was devised by Bogoraz in 1931 and was based on the [[Latin script]]:

In 1937, this alphabet, along with all of the other alphabets of the non-Slavic peoples of the USSR, was replaced by a [[Cyrillic]] alphabet. At first it was the [[Russian alphabet]] with the addition of the digraphs ''К’ к’'' and ''Н’ н’''. In the 1950s the additional letters were replaced by ''Ӄ ӄ'' and ''Ӈ ӈ''. These newer letters were mainly used in educational texts, while the press continued to use the older versions. At the end of the 1980s, the letter ''Ԓ ԓ'' was introduced as a replacement for ''Л л''. This was intended to reduce confusion with the pronunciation of the Russian letter of the same form. The Chukchi alphabet now stands as follows:

There are no voiced [[plosive consonant|stops]] in the language.

The vowels are {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/u/}}, {{IPA|/e&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/}}, {{IPA|/e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/}}, {{IPA|/o/}}, {{IPA|/a/}}, and {{IPA|/ə/}}. {{IPA|/e&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/}} and {{IPA|/e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/}} are pronounced identically but behave differently in the phonology.  (Cf. the two kinds of {{IPA|/i/}} in [[Eskimo language|Inuit Eskimo]], whose known cause is the merger of two vowels {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/ə/}}, which are still separate in [[Eskimo language|Yup'ik Eskimo]].)

A notable feature of Chukchi is its [[vowel harmony]] system largely based on [[vowel height]]. {{IPA|/i, u, e&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/}} alternate with {{IPA|/e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, o, a/}}, respectively. The second group is known as "dominant vowels" and the first group as "recessive vowels"; that is because whenever a "dominant" vowel is present anywhere in a word, all "recessive" vowels in the word change into their "dominant" counterpart. The [[schwa]] vowel {{IPA|/ə/}} does not alternate but may trigger harmony as if it belonged to the dominant group.

Initial and final consonant clusters are not tolerated, and schwa epenthesis is pervasive.

Stress tends to: 1. be penultimate; 2. stay within the stem; 3. avoid [[schwa]]s.

== Grammar ==
Chukchi is a largely [[polysynthetic]], [[agglutinative]], [[direct-inverse language]] and has [[Ergative–absolutive language|ergative–absolutive alignment]]. It also has very pervasive [[Incorporation (linguistics)|incorporation]]. In particular, the incorporation is productive and often interacts with other linguistic processes.&lt;ref name="Spencer 1995"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spencer|first=Andrew|date=1995|title=Incorporation in Chukchi|journal=Language|volume=71|issue=3|doi=10.2307/416217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chukchi allows free incorporation of adjuncts, such as when a noun incorporates its modifier.&lt;ref name="Spencer 1995"/&gt; However, besides the unusual use of adjuncts, Chukchi behaves in a very normal linguistic manner. The language of Chukchi also uses a specific verb system. The basic locative construction of a sentence in Chukchi contains a single locative verb, unlike many other languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dunn|first=Michael|date=2007|title=Four Languages From The Lower End Of The Typology Of Locative Predication.|journal=Linguistics|volume=45|issue=5/6|doi=10.1515/ling.2007.026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''nominals'', there are two numbers and about nine grammatical cases: absolutive, ergative, instrumental, locative, ablative, allative, orientative, two comitatives and a designative. Nouns are split into three declensions influenced by [[animacy]]: the first declension, which contains non-humans, has plural marking only in the absolutive case; the second one, which contains personal names and certain words for mainly older relatives, has obligatory plural marking in all forms; the third one, which contains other humans than those in the second declension, has optional plural marking. These nominal cases are used to identify the number of nouns, as well as their purpose and function in a sentence.&lt;ref name="Spencer 1995"/&gt;

''Verbs'' distinguish three persons, two numbers, three moods (declarative, imperative and conditional), two voices (active and [[antipassive]]) and six tenses: present I (progressive), present II (stative), past I ([[aorist]]), past II ([[perfect (grammar)|perfect]]), future I (perfective future), future II (imperfective future). Past II is formed with a construction meaning possession (literally "to be with"), similar to the use of "have" in the perfect in English and other Western European languages.

Both subject and direct object are cross-referenced in the verbal chain, and [[person agreement]] is very different in intransitive and transitive verbs. Person agreement is expressed with a complex system involving both prefixes and suffixes; despite the agglutinative nature of the language, each individual combination of person, number, tense etc. is expressed in a way that is far from always straightforward. Besides the [[finite verb|finite forms]], there are also infinitive, [[supine]] (purposive), numerous [[gerund]] forms, and a present and past participle, and these are all used with auxiliary verbs to produce further analytic constructions.

The ''numeral'' system was originally purely [[vigesimal]] and went up to 400, but a decimal system was introduced for numerals above 100 via Russian influence. Many of the names of the basic numbers can be traced etymologically to words referring to the human body ("finger", "hand" etc.) or to arithmetic operations (6 = "1 + 5" etc.).

The word order is rather free, though [[Subject–object–verb|SOV]] is basic. The possessor normally precedes the possessed, and [[postposition]]s rather than prepositions are used.

Chukchi as a language often proves difficult to categorize. This is primarily due to the fact that it does not always follow a typical linguistic and syntactical pattern. These exceptions allow Chukchi to fit into more than one linguistic type.&lt;ref name="Spencer 1995"/&gt;

== People ==
The Chukchi people have a rich history and culture, which have traditionally centered around war.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Chukchi prize warriors and the fighting spirit that they embody. This emphasis on conflict can be seen in the interactions between the Chukchi and the Russians, which date back to the middle of the seventeenth century and tell of glorious battles between the two groups.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bogoras|first=W.|date=1901|year=|title=The Chukchi of Northeastern Asia|url=|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=3|issue=1|pages=80–108|via=|doi=10.1525/aa.1901.3.1.02a00060}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chukchi have also been known to battle nearby tribes, particularly the Tánñit, which comprise fellow Siberian peoples known as the Koryaks. However, over the last century, the Chukchi people have engaged in far fewer conflicts and have focused more on trading. Today, the Chukchi economy relies heavily on trade, particularly with Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Red Book of the Peoples of the Russian Empire|last=Kolga|first=M.|publisher=Tallinn: NGO Red Book|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides trading with Russia, the Chukchi make their living off of herding reindeer and bartering with other tribes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is also a group of Chukchi that do not herd reindeer and instead live along the coast, trading more with tribes who live along the pacific coast. Some Chukchi people even choose to go back and forth between the two divisions, trading with both. These people tend to control more of the trade and have been called Kavrálît or “Rangers”.

== External influence ==
The external influences of Chukchi have not been well-studied. In  particular, the degree of contacts between the Chukchi and [[Eskimo–Aleut languages|Eskimo]] languages remains an open question. [[Research]] into this area is problematic in part because of the lack of written evidence.  (Cf. de Reuse in the Bibliography.) Contact influence of Russian, which is increasing, consists of word borrowing and pressure on surface [[syntax]]; the latter is primarily seen in written communication (translated texts) and is not apparent in day-to-day speech.

'''''Cool World''''' is a 1992 American [[Films with live action and animation|live-action/animated]] [[Thriller film|thriller]]-[[fantasy film]] directed by [[Ralph Bakshi]], and starring [[Kim Basinger]], [[Gabriel Byrne]] and [[Brad Pitt]]. It tells the story of a [[cartoonist]] who finds himself in the animated world he thinks he created, and is seduced by one of the characters, a comic strip [[femme fatale|vamp]] who wants to be real. 

''Cool World'' marked Bakshi's return to feature films after nine years. The film was originally pitched as an animated [[horror film]] about an [[underground comix|underground cartoonist]] who fathers an illegitimate half-real/half-cartoon daughter, who hates herself for what she is and tries to kill him. During production, Bakshi's original screenplay was scrapped by producer [[Frank Mancuso, Jr.]] and heavily rewritten by [[Michael Grais]] and [[Mark Victor]] in secret. Reviews praised the film's visuals, but criticized the story and characters, as well as the combination of live-action and animation, which some critics felt was unconvincing. The film would eventually gross only half its production budget.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. --&gt;
In 1945 Las Vegas, World War II veteran Frank Harris returns from Italy with a motorcycle and reunites with his mother, Agatha. Frank and Agatha are struck in a traffic collision with a drunk driver while riding his motorcycle, resulting in Agatha's death; Frank is transported to an animated realm named the "Cool World". 

Forty-seven years later, detained cartoonist Jack Deebs creates a comic book named ''Cool World'', which features the [[femme fatale]] Holli Would. Holli voices her desire to enter the real world, but is declined help from Frank, who is now a detective in the Cool World. After being released from prison, Jack is transported to the Cool World and is smuggled into a club by Holli. 

Frank becomes aware of Jack's presence in the Cool World and aggressively confronts him, informing him that Cool World has existed long before Jack created the comic series and warns him that "noids" (humans from the real world) aren't allowed to have sex with "doodles" (the inhabitants of the Cool World). Holli brings Jack back into the Cool World and the two have sex, causing Holli to transform into a human.

While Frank attempts to mend his relationship with doodle Lonette, he temporarily leaves detective duties to his assistant Nails. Jack and Holli leave for the real world, causing damage to the interdimensional barrier between the real world and the Cool World. Both Jack and Holli begin flickering from their human form to their doodle forms: Jack's doodle form is a stocky man with a moustache while Holli's new doodle form is a sexy clown. 

Frank discovers that Nails has been done away with and decides to venture into the real world to pursue Jack and Holli. While contemplating their situation, Holli tells Jack about the "Spike of Power," an artifact placed on the top of a Las Vegas casino by a doodle who crossed into the real world. When Jack displays skepticism about the idea, Holli abandons Jack to search for the spike on her own.

When Frank pursues Holli on the casino. Holli, as a sexy clown doodle, is able to jump through walls. Which she does to enter a locked room. As Frank attempts to kick in the locked door, Holli in her sexy clown doodle form, kicks him in the groin through the door. Enraged, Frank kicks open the door and corners her. Holli tries to use her sexy clown doodle form to escape to the next room but fails. Holli kills him by kicking him off the building. 

Holli finds and takes the Spike of Power, transforming her and Jack into doodles and releasing numerous monstrous doodles into the real world. Fighting off an increasing number of doodles as a superhero doodle, Jack returns the Spike of Power to its place, trapping him, Holli and the rest of the doodles in Cool World. Though Frank was killed by Holli, since she killed him in her doodle-form, Frank's reborn into Cool World as a doodle, which allows him to finally be able to consummate his relationship with Lonette.

==Production==
[[File:Cool World storyboard.jpg|thumb|right|Storyboard by Louise Zingarelli based on Bakshi's original screenplay]]
In 1990, [[Ralph Bakshi]] decided that it was time to make another animated film. According to Bakshi, "I made 1,500 bucks in 10 years of painting; I thought it would be nice to pick up a piece of change. So I called my lawyer, who was still speaking to me because no one ever leaves Hollywood, and asked him where I should go to sell a movie."&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://movies2.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?title1=COOL%20WORLD%20(MOVIE)&amp;title2=&amp;reviewer=JAMIE%20DIAMOND&amp;pdate=&amp;v_id= |title=Animation's Bad Boy Returns, Unrepentant |accessdate=2007-03-21 |last=Diamond |first=Jamie |date=July 5, 1991 |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914100047/http://movies2.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?title1=COOL%20WORLD%20(MOVIE)&amp;title2=&amp;reviewer=JAMIE%20DIAMOND&amp;pdate=&amp;v_id= |archive-date=September 14, 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bakshi pitched ''Cool World'' to [[Paramount Pictures]] (where Bakshi had worked as the final head of the studio's [[Famous Studios|animation division]]) as an animated [[horror film]]. The concept of the film involved a cartoon and live action human having sex and conceiving a hybrid child who visits the real world to murder the father who abandoned her.&lt;ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-219"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gibson |first1=Jon M. |last2=McDonnell |first2=Chris |title=Unfiltered: The Complete Ralph Bakshi |year=2008 |publisher=Universe Publishing |isbn=0-7893-1684-6 |pages=219; 227 |chapter=Ups &amp; Downs }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bakshi states that Paramount Pictures "bought the idea in ten seconds".&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://filmforce.ign.com/articles/518/518805p1.html |title=Interview with Ralph Bakshi |accessdate=2007-01-10 |publisher=IGN |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060218211315/http://filmforce.ign.com/articles/518/518805p1.html |archivedate=February 18, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the sets were being built in [[Las Vegas]], producer [[Frank Mancuso, Jr.]], son of Paramount president [[Frank Mancuso, Sr.]], had the screenplay rewritten in secret, and gave Bakshi a new screenplay by screenwriters [[Michael Grais]] and [[Mark Victor]] that "was barely the same".&lt;ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-219"/&gt; [[Larry Gross]] also contributed to the script, but his work would later go on to be uncredited. In interviews at the time of the film's release, Mancuso, Jr., who was best known for the ''[[Friday the 13th (franchise)|Friday the 13th]]'' franchise, stated a desire to move away from horror films, and wanted to produce a film "about what happens when someone creates a world, becomes defined by it, and then can't escape [...] a film about being trapped by your own creation."&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; Bakshi remembers that he got into a fight with Mancuso, Jr. and "punched [him] in the mouth."&lt;ref name="DVD Verdict"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/interviews/ralphbakshi.php |title=Rotoscoped Memories: An Interview with Ralph Bakshi |accessdate=2007-01-10 |date=August 2, 2004 |publisher=DVD Verdict |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312215829/http://www.dvdverdict.com/interviews/ralphbakshi.php |archivedate=March 12, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paramount threatened Bakshi with a lawsuit if he refused to complete the film. "I thought if I did the animation well, it would be worth it, but you know what? It wasn't worth it."&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,,1841791,00.html |title=Who flamed Roger Rabbit? |accessdate=2007-01-10 |date=August 11, 2006 |publisher=[[The Guardian]] | location=London | first=Steve | last=Rose}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bakshi also stated that he "had a lot of animators there that I'd brought in and I thought that maybe I could just have fun animating this stuff, which I did."&lt;ref name="DVD Verdict"/&gt; Bakshi had developed the film as a mix of comedy and horror that he described as "a hard R-rated story" but Paramount wanted a PG-13 film, one of the reasons for the doomed and angry relationship between filmmaker and studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=2013-02-28|title=Still Bakshi after all these years: Iconoclastic 'Fritz the Cat' director has another tale to tell|first=Jeff|last=Labrecque|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2013/02/28/ralph-bakshi-last-days-of-coney-island/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bakshi had originally intended to cast [[Drew Barrymore]] and Brad Pitt in the film's leading roles. Brad Pitt was cast as Frank Harris instead, with Gabriel Byrne as Deebs and Kim Basinger as Holli.&lt;ref name="DVD Verdict"/&gt; The film's voice cast includes [[Maurice LaMarche]], [[Charlie Adler]] and [[Candi Milo]]. According to Bakshi, Basinger had attempted to rewrite the film halfway into its production because she "thought it would be great [...] if she would be able to show this picture in hospitals to sick children [...] I said, 'Kim, I think that's wonderful, but you've got the wrong guy to do that with.' [...] [Mancuso] was sitting there with Kim [...] agreeing with her."&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt;

The visual design of the live-action footage was intended to look like "a living, walk-through painting", a visual concept Bakshi had long wanted to achieve. The film's sets were based upon enlargements of designer Barry Jackson's paintings. The animation was strongly influenced by [[Fleischer Studios]] (whose cartoons were released by Paramount) and Terrytoons (where Bakshi once worked, and whose [[Mighty Mouse]] character was also adapted into a series by Bakshi).&lt;ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-219"/&gt; The artwork by the character Jack Deebs was drawn by [[underground comix]] artist [[Spain Rodriguez]].&lt;ref name="Spain1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diesirae911.com/spain.html |title=About Spain |accessdate=2007-01-10 |author= |authorlink= |vauthors= |date= |year= |month= |work= |publisher=Dies Irae |pages= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's animators were never given a screenplay, and were instead told by Bakshi to "Do a scene that's funny, whatever you want to do!"&lt;ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-219"/&gt;

A [[soundtrack album]], ''[[Cool World (soundtrack)|Songs from the Cool World]]'', featuring recordings by [[My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult]], [[Moby]], [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], [[The Future Sound of London]], and others, was released in 1992 by [[Warner Bros.

==Release and reception==

===Promotion and merchandising===

===Reception===
[[File:Cool World characters Jack and Holly.jpg|thumb|Jack and Holli. Reviews were critical of the [[compositing]] of animation and live-action.]]
''Cool World'' opened at sixth on the North American box office, with $5.5 million. Its lifetime gross was $14.1 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=coolworld.htm|title=Cool World (1992)|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=2011-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; a little more than half its reported $28 million budget.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; The review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] collected a sample of 46 reviews and judged 4% of them to be positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1040378-cool_world/ |title=''Cool World'' (1992) |accessdate=2007-01-10 |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Flixster]]|quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' wrote that ''Cool World'' "misses one opportunity after another", describing it as "a surprisingly incompetent film".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19920713/REVIEWS/207130301/1023|title=Review of ''Cool World'' |accessdate=2007-01-10 |last=Ebert |first=Roger |authorlink= Roger Ebert |coauthors= |date=July 13, 1992 |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Deseret News]]'' reviewer Chris Hicks described it as "a one-joke movie – and it's a [[Off-color humor|dirty joke]].

In 1997, John Grant wrote in ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'' that ''Cool World'' "stands as one of the fantastic cinema's most significant achievements, an instauration fantasy that reveals greater depths with each viewing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Grant |first=John |others= |title=Masters of Animation |year=2001 |publisher=Watson-Guptill |isbn=0-8230-3041-5 |page=28 |chapter=Ralph Bakshi }}&lt;/ref&gt; Animation historian [[Jerry Beck]] described the film as being "for adults and Bakshi completists only," writing that the film "has a great premise, a great cast, and the best animation he's ever been involved with," but critiquing it as a "pointless rehash of many of Ralph's favorite themes, and the story literally goes nowhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beck |first=Jerry |title=The Animated Movie Guide |year=2005 |publisher=Chicago Review Press |isbn=978-1-55652-591-9 |chapter=''Cool World'' |page=58 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film garnered a [[Razzie Award]] nomination for Worst Actress ([[Kim Basinger]]; also for ''[[Final Analysis]]'').

==Plot==
Coraline Jones and her parents move from [[Pontiac, Michigan]], to their new home in [[Ashland, Oregon]], the dilapidated Pink Palace Apartments. Her eccentric new neighbors include Mr. Bobinsky, Miss Spink and Miss Forcible. Due to her parents constantly working, Coraline frequently explores the area. Whilst exploring, she meets a black cat and Wyborne "Wybie" Lovat, the grandson of the landlady, whose twin sister mysteriously disappeared years ago. Wybie gives Coraline a button-eyed ragdoll that resembles her. The doll then lures her to a small door in the living room, which is bricked up and can only be unlocked by a button key. 

That night, a mouse guides her through the door, where the bricks have been replaced by a corridor to the Other World, inhabited by button-eyed [[doppelgänger]]s of people from her world. Coraline meets the Other Mother and Other Father, who are much more attentive and entertaining than her real parents. After dinner, she goes to sleep in her Other Bedroom, but awakes in her real bedroom. Despite cryptic warnings from her neighbors, Coraline visits the Other World three times, where she meets the Other Mr. Bobinsky, who performs a mice circus, the Other Miss Spink and Miss Forcible, who perform a never-ending burlesque act and the Other Wybie, who is mute. Despite having no Other World counterpart, the black cat is able to speak in the Other World.

The Other Mother invites Coraline to stay forever, under the condition that a pair of buttons will be sewn over her eyes. Terrified, Coraline attempts to flee, but the Other Mother sees through her plan and blocks all the exits to the real world. The cat reappears and reveals to her the sinister truth about the Other World and the Other Mother. The Other Mother, appearing taller, thinner and more grotesque, then "disciplines" Coraline by imprisoning her behind a mirror. There, Coraline meets the ghosts of previous victims, including the missing twin sister of Wybie's grandmother. They reveal that the Other Mother, whom they refer to as the Beldam, created and sent button-eyed rag dolls that resembled them in order to spy on their lives. With the promise of a better life, she lured them into the Other World, where she sewed buttons over their eyes and consumed their lives. To free their souls, their real eyes need to be found. Coraline promises to help.

Coraline is suddenly rescued from the mirror by the Other Wybie, whose mouth has been stitched by the Beldam. He helps her escape back to the real world, but Coraline discovers that her parents are missing. She eventually deduces that they have been kidnapped by the Beldam and returns to the Other World, but not before Spink and Forcible grant her a stone with a hole in it. The cat advises Coraline to propose a "game". Coraline proposes a game to the Beldam: if Coraline cannot find her parents and the ghosts' eyes, she will let buttons be sewn over her eyes, but if she can, they will all be set free. The Beldam reluctantly agrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aLusAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA102 |title=Acting for Animators |author=Ed Hooks |publisher=Routledge |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the stone, Coraline finds the ghosts' eyes in the Other World, now turned into nightmarish, from its monstrous, freakish, deranged inhabitants. As she does, the Other Pink Palace Apartments' surroundings gradually disintegrate until only the living room is left. Inside, Coraline sees the Beldam in her skeletal-[[arachnid|arachnoid]] form. Warned that the Beldam will never accept Coraline's victory, she tricks her into unlocking the door. While the Beldam is distracted, Coraline finds her parents trapped in a [[snow globe]], grabs it, and throws the cat at the Beldam's face, ripping her button eyes out. The Beldam furiously converts the floor into a spiderweb but Coraline and the cat manage to climb out of it, slam and lock the door shut on the Beldam's hand, severing it. 

Her parents reappear in the real world, with no memory of what happened. That night, the ghosts warn her to get rid of the button key to prevent the Beldam from accessing the real world. As Coraline prepares to drop it down the well, the severed hand attacks her and tries to drag her back to the Other World. Wybie smashes it with a rock, then throws the remains and the key into the well and seals it shut to prevent anyone else from entering the Other World. The next day, Coraline and her parents, who have finally finished their work, host a garden party for the neighbors. Coraline also prepares to tell Mrs. Lovat the truth about her twin sister whilst the cat disappears behind the pink palace welcome sign.

Director [[Henry Selick]] met author [[Neil Gaiman]] just as Gaiman was finishing the novel ''[[Coraline]]'', and given that Gaiman was a fan of Selick's ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'', he invited him to make a possible adaptation of the film. As Selick thought a direct adaptation would lead to "maybe a 47-minute movie", his screenplay had some expansions, such as the creation of Wybie. When looking for a design away from that of most animation, Selick discovered the work of Japanese illustrator Tadahiro Uesugi and invited him to become the concept artist. One of Uesugi's biggest influences was on the color palette, which was muted in reality and more colorful in the Other World.&lt;ref name=making&gt;"The Making of Coraline", ''Coraline'' DVD&lt;/ref&gt; Uesugi declared that "at the beginning, it was supposed to be a small project over a few weeks to simply create characters; however, I ended up working on the project for over a year, eventually designing sets and backgrounds, on top of drawing the basic images for the story to be built upon."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Desowitz|first1=Bill|title=Tadahiro Uesugi Talks 'Coraline' Design|url=http://www.awn.com/animationworld/tadahiro-uesugi-talks-coraline-design|publisher=Animation World|accessdate=August 17, 2014|date=January 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soundtrack==

The soundtrack for ''Coraline'' features songs by French composer [[Bruno Coulais]], with one, "Other Father Song", by [[They Might Be Giants]]. The Other Father's singing voice is provided by [[John Linnell]], one of the singers from the band. They had initially written 10 songs for the film; when a melancholy tone was decided, all but one were cut. Coulais' score was performed by the Hungarian Symphony Orchestra and features choral pieces sung by the Children's Choir of [[Nice]] in a [[Gibberish|nonsense language]].&lt;ref name=AICNTalksSelick&gt;{{cite web|author1=Capone|title=Capone Talks with Coraline Director and Wizard Master Henry Selick|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/39977|publisher=Ain't It Cool News|accessdate=August 17, 2014|date=February 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selick mentions that the main soloist, "a young girl you hear singing in several parts of the film," is coincidentally named Coraline.&lt;ref name=AICNTalksSelick /&gt; ''Coraline'' won Coulais the 2009 [[Annie Award]] for best score for an animated feature.

== Reception ==

===Box office===
According to Paul Dergarabedian, a film business analyst with Media by Numbers, for the film to succeed it needed a box office comparable to ''[[Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit]]'', which had grossed $16 million its opening weekend and ended up making more than $192 million worldwide; prior to the film's release, Dergarabedian thought [[Laika Studios]] "should be really pleased" were ''Coraline'' to make $10 million in its opening weekend.&lt;ref name="wweek"/&gt; In its US opening weekend, the film grossed $16.85 million, ranking third at the box office.&lt;ref name=THRIntoYou /&gt; It made $15 million during its second weekend, bringing its U.S. total up to $35.6 million, $25.5 million of which came from 3D presentations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=2548 |title=Holdovers Live Under Killer ''Friday'' Debut |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] |date=February 15, 2009 |accessdate=February 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of November 2009, the film has grossed $75,286,229 in the United States and Canada and $49,310,169 in other territories, for a total of $124,596,398 worldwide.&lt;ref name="boxoffice"/&gt;

===Critical response===
On [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 90% based on 262 reviews, with an average rating of 7.8/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "With its vivid stop-motion animation combined with Neil Gaiman's imaginative story, ''Coraline'' is a film that's both visually stunning and wondrously entertaining."&lt;ref name="Rotten Tomatoes"&gt;{{cite web|title=''Coraline'' (2009)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/coraline/ |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |date=February 5, 2009 |accessdate=February 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 80 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Coraline'' Reviews |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/coraline |publisher=[[Metacritic]] |date=February 5, 2009 |accessdate=February 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Edelstein]] said the film is "a ''[[bona fide]]'' [[fairy tale]]" that needed a "touch less entrancement and a touch more&amp;nbsp;... story."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nymag.com/movies/reviews/53785/ |title=What You See Is What You Get |last=Edelstein |first=David |authorlink=David Edelstein |publisher=[[New York (magazine)|New York Magazine]] |date=February 1, 2009 |accessdate=February 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[A. O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film "exquisitely realized," with a "slower pace and a more contemplative tone than the novel. It is certainly exciting, but rather than race through ever noisier set pieces toward a hectic climax in the manner of so much animation aimed at kids, ''Coraline'' lingers in an atmosphere that is creepy, wonderfully strange and full of feeling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2009/02/06/movies/06cora.html| title=Cornered in a Parallel World |last=Scott |first=A.O. |authorlink=A.

'''Creativity''' is a phenomenon whereby something new and somehow valuable is formed. The created item may be intangible (such as an [[idea]], a [[scientific theory]], a [[musical composition]], or a [[joke]]) or a physical object (such as an [[invention]], a [[Literature|literary work]], or a [[painting]]).

Scholarly interest in creativity is found in a number of disciplines, primarily [[psychology]], [[business studies]], and [[cognitive science]], but also [[education]], [[technology]], [[engineering]], [[philosophy]] (particularly [[philosophy of science]]), [[theology]], [[sociology]], [[linguistics]],  and [[economics]], covering  the relations between creativity and general [[intelligence]], personality type, mental and neurological processes, mental health, or [[artificial intelligence]]; the potential for fostering creativity through education and training; the fostering of creativity for national economic benefit, and the application of creative resources to improve the effectiveness of teaching and learning.

== Etymology ==
The [[lexeme]] in the English word ''creativity'' comes from the [[Latin]] term ''creō'' "to create, make": its [[Morphological derivation|derivational suffixes]] also come from Latin. The word "create" appeared in English as early as the 14th century, notably in Chaucer, to indicate divine creation&lt;ref name="RuncoAlbert"&gt;{{cite book|last=Runco|first=Mark A.|title=The Cambridge Handbook of Creativity|year=2010|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-73025-9|author2=Albert, Robert S.|editor=[[James C. Kaufman]] |editor2=Robert J. Sternberg|chapter=Creativity Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in [[The Parson's Tale]]&lt;ref&gt;"And eke Job saith, that in hell is no order of rule. And albeit that God hath '''created''' all things in right order, and nothing without order, but all things be ordered and numbered, yet nevertheless they that be damned be not in order, nor hold no order."&lt;/ref&gt;). However, its modern meaning as an act of human creation did not emerge until after [[Age of Enlightenment|the Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name=RuncoAlbert /&gt;

== Definition ==
In a summary of scientific research into creativity, Michael Mumford suggested: "Over the course of the last decade, however, we seem to have reached a general agreement that creativity involves the production of novel, useful products" (Mumford, 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;110),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mumford | first1 = M. D. | year = 2003 | title = Where have we been, where are we going? Taking stock in creativity research | url = | journal = [[Creativity Research Journal]] | volume = 15 | issue = 2–3| pages = 107–120 | doi=10.1080/10400419.2003.9651403}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, in [[Robert Sternberg]]'s words, the production of "something original and worthwhile".&lt;ref name="Sternberg Cognitive Psychology 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sternberg|first1=Robert J.|title=Cognitive Psychology|date=2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-133-38701-5|page=479|edition=6|chapter=Creativity}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authors have diverged dramatically in their precise definitions beyond these general commonalities: Peter Meusburger reckons that over a hundred different analyses can be found in the literature.&lt;ref name="Meusburger1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Meusburger|first=Peter|title=Milieus of Creativity: An Interdisciplinary Approach to Spatiality of Creativity|year=2009|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-9876-5 |editor=Meusburger, P. |editor2=Funke, J. |editor3=Wunder, E.|chapter=Milieus of Creativity: The Role of Places, Environments and Spatial Contexts}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an illustration, one definition given by [[Ellis Paul Torrance|Dr. E. Paul Torrance]] described it as "a process of becoming sensitive to problems, deficiencies, gaps in knowledge, missing elements, disharmonies, and so on; identifying the difficulty; searching for solutions, making guesses, or formulating hypotheses about the deficiencies: testing and retesting these hypotheses and possibly modifying and retesting them; and finally communicating the results."&lt;ref name="Torrance Test Manual Verbal"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Torrance|first1=Paul|title=The Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking-Norms-Technical Manual Research Edition|publisher=Personnel Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|page=6|chapter=Verbal Tests. Forms A and B-Figural Tests, Forms A and B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aspects ==
Theories of creativity (particularly investigation of why some people are more creative than others) have focused on a variety of aspects. The dominant factors are usually identified as "the four Ps" — process, product, person, and place (according to [[James Melvin Rhodes|Mel Rhodes]]).&lt;ref&gt;Mel Rhodes: [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/20342603?uid=3737864&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21103750220081''An Analysis of Creativity.''] in Phi Delta Kappan 1961, Vol. 42,  No. 7, p. 306–307&lt;/ref&gt; A focus on ''process'' is shown in cognitive approaches that try to describe thought mechanisms and techniques for creative thinking. Theories invoking divergent rather than convergent thinking (such as [[J. P. Guilford|Guilford]]), or those describing the staging of the creative process (such as [[Graham Wallas|Wallas]]) are primarily theories of creative process. A focus on creative ''product'' usually appears in attempts to measure creativity (psychometrics, see below) and in creative ideas framed as successful [[memetics|memes]].&lt;ref name="Gabora"&gt;{{cite journal|last=[[Liane Gabora|Gabora, Liane]]|year=1997|title= The Origin and Evolution of Culture and Creativity|journal=Journal of Memetics – Evolutionary Models of Information Transmission|volume=1|url=http://cogprints.org/794/1/oecc.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychometric approach to creativity reveals that it also involves the ability to produce more.&lt;ref name="Sternberg 2009 468"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sternberg|first=Robert J.|title=Cognitive Psychology|year=2009|publisher=CENGAGE Learning|isbn=978-0-495-50629-4|page=468|editor=Jaime A. Perkins |editor2=Dan Moneypenny |editor3=Wilson Co}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A focus on the nature of the creative ''person'' considers more general intellectual habits, such as openness, levels of [[Ideation (creative process)|ideation]], autonomy, expertise, exploratory behavior, and so on. A focus on ''place'' considers the circumstances in which creativity flourishes, such as degrees of autonomy, access to resources, and the nature of gatekeepers. Creative lifestyles are characterized by nonconforming attitudes and behaviors as well as flexibility.&lt;ref name="Sternberg 2009 468" /&gt;

== History of the concept ==
{{Main|History of the concept of creativity}}
[[File:Plato-raphael.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Greek philosophers like Plato rejected the concept of creativity, preferring to see art as a form of discovery. Asked in ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', "Will we say, of a painter, that he makes something?", Plato answers, "Certainly not, he merely [[mimesis|imitates]]."&lt;ref name="Six Ideas p. 244"&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], ''A History of Six Ideas: an Essay in Aesthetics'', p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

=== Ancient views ===
Most ancient cultures, including thinkers of [[Ancient Greece]],&lt;ref name="Six Ideas p. 244" /&gt; [[History of China#Ancient China|Ancient China]], and [[Outline of ancient India|Ancient India]],&lt;ref name="Albert99"&gt;{{cite book|last=Albert|first= R. S.|author2=Runco, M. A.|year=1999|editor = Sternberg, R. J.|title= Handbook of Creativity|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]|chapter=:A History of Research on Creativity}}&lt;/ref&gt; lacked the concept of creativity, seeing art as a form of discovery and not creation. The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] had no terms corresponding to "to create" or "creator" except for the expression "''poiein''" ("to make"), which only applied to ''poiesis'' (poetry) and to the ''poietes'' (poet, or "maker") who made it. [[Plato]] did not believe in art as a form of creation. Asked in ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Plato, The Republic, Book X – [[wikisource:The Republic/Book X]]&lt;/ref&gt; "Will we say, of a painter, that he makes something?", he answers, "Certainly not, he merely [[mimesis|imitates]]."&lt;ref name="Six Ideas p. 244" /&gt;

It is commonly argued that the notion of "creativity" originated in [[Western culture]] through [[Christianity]], as a matter of [[Revelation|divine inspiration]].&lt;ref name="RuncoAlbert" /&gt; According to the historian [[Daniel J.

=== The Enlightenment and after ===
The rejection of creativity in favor of discovery and the belief that individual creation was a conduit of the divine would dominate the West probably until the [[Renaissance]] and even later.&lt;ref name="NiuSternberg" /&gt; The development of the modern concept of creativity begins in the [[Renaissance]], when creation began to be perceived as having originated from the abilities of the individual, and not God. This could be attributed to the leading intellectual movement of the time, aptly named [[humanism]], which developed an intensely human-centric outlook on the world, valuing the intellect and achievement of the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Humanism - Rome Reborn: The Vatican Library &amp; Renaissance Culture {{!}} Exhibitions - Library of Congress|url = https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/vatican/humanism.html|website = www.loc.gov|date = 1993-01-08|accessdate = 2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this philosophy arose the [[Renaissance man]] (or polymath), an individual who embodies the principals of humanism in their ceaseless courtship with knowledge and creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Leonardo da Vinci {{!}} Italian artist, engineer, and scientist|url = http://www.britannica.com/biography/Leonardo-da-Vinci|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate = 2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most well-known and immensely accomplished examples is [[Leonardo da Vinci]].

However, this shift was gradual and would not become immediately apparent until the Enlightenment.&lt;ref name="Albert3" /&gt; By the 18th century and the [[Age of Enlightenment]], mention of creativity (notably in [[aesthetics]]), linked with the concept of [[imagination]], became more frequent.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz80"&gt;{{cite book |author=Tatarkiewicz, Władysław |authorlink=Władysław Tatarkiewicz |title=A History of Six Ideas: an Essay in Aesthetics |location=Translated from the Polish by [[Christopher Kasparek]], The Hague |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff |year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the writing of [[Thomas Hobbes]], imagination became a key element of human cognition;&lt;ref name="RuncoAlbert" /&gt; [[William Duff (writer)|William Duff]] was one of the first to identify imagination as a quality of [[genius]], typifying the separation being made between talent (productive, but breaking no new ground) and genius.&lt;ref name="Dacey" /&gt;

As a direct and independent topic of study, creativity effectively received no attention until the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Dacey" /&gt; Runco and Albert argue that creativity as the subject of proper study began seriously to emerge in the late 19th century with the increased interest in individual differences inspired by the arrival of [[Darwinism]]. In particular, they refer to the work of [[Francis Galton]], who through his [[Eugenics|eugenicist]] outlook took a keen interest in the heritability of intelligence, with creativity taken as an aspect of genius.&lt;ref name="RuncoAlbert" /&gt;

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, leading mathematicians and scientists such as [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] (1896) and [[Henri Poincaré]] (1908) began to reflect on and publicly discuss their creative processes.

=== Twentieth century to the present day ===
The insights of Poincaré and von Helmholtz were built on in early accounts of the creative process by pioneering theorists such as [[Graham Wallas]]&lt;ref name="Wallas26"&gt;{{cite book |author=Wallas, G. |title=Art of Thought |year=1926 |authorlink=Graham Wallas}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Max Wertheimer]]. In his work ''Art of Thought'', published in 1926, Wallas presented one of the first models of the creative process. In the Wallas stage model, creative insights and illuminations may be explained by a process consisting of 5 stages:
:(i) ''preparation'' (preparatory work on a problem that focuses the individual's mind on the problem and explores the problem's dimensions),
:(ii) ''incubation'' (where the problem is internalized into the unconscious mind and nothing appears externally to be happening),
:(iii) ''intimation'' (the creative person gets a "feeling" that a solution is on its way),
:(iv) ''illumination'' or insight (where the creative idea bursts forth from its [[preconscious]] processing into conscious awareness);
:(v) ''verification'' (where the idea is consciously verified, elaborated, and then applied).
Wallas' model is often treated as four stages, with "intimation" seen as a sub-stage.

Wallas considered creativity to be a legacy of the [[evolution]]ary process, which allowed humans to quickly adapt to rapidly changing environments. Simonton&lt;ref name="Simonton99"&gt;{{cite book |author=Simonton, D. K. |year=1999 |title=Origins of genius: Darwinian perspectives on creativity |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides an updated perspective on this view in his book, ''Origins of genius: Darwinian perspectives on creativity''.

In 1927, [[Alfred North Whitehead]] gave the Gifford Lectures at the University of Edinburgh, later published as ''[[Process and Reality]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Whitehead|first=Alfred North|title=Process and reality : an essay in cosmology ; Gifford Lectures delivered in the University of Edinburgh during the session 1927–28|year=1978|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-02-934580-1|edition=Corrected}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is credited with having coined the term "creativity" to serve as the ultimate category of his metaphysical scheme: "Whitehead actually coined the term – our term, still the preferred currency of exchange among literature, science, and the arts. . . a term that quickly became so popular, so omnipresent, that its invention within living memory, and by Alfred North Whitehead of all people, quickly became occluded".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Steven|title=Introduction: Whitehead Now|journal=Configurations|year=2005|volume=1|issue=13|pages=1–33}}. Cf. [[Michel Weber]] and Will Desmond (eds.). ''[https://www.academia.edu/279955/Handbook_of_Whiteheadian_Process_Thought Handbook of Whiteheadian Process Thought]'' (Frankfurt / Lancaster, Ontos Verlag, Process Thought X1 &amp; X2, 2008) and Ronny Desmet &amp; Michel Weber (edited by), ''[https://www.academia.edu/279940/Whitehead._The_Algebra_of_Metaphysics Whitehead. The Algebra of Metaphysics. Applied Process Metaphysics Summer Institute Memorandum]'', Louvain-la-Neuve, Les Éditions Chromatika, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The formal [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] measurement of creativity, from the standpoint of orthodox [[Psychology|psychological]] literature, is usually considered to have begun with [[J. P. Guilford]]'s 1950 address to the [[American Psychological Association]], which helped popularize the topic&lt;ref name="Sternberg99"&gt;{{cite book |author=Sternberg, R. J. |author2=Lubart, T. I. |chapter=The Concept of Creativity: Prospects and Paradigms |editor=Sternberg, R. J. |title=Handbook of Creativity |year=1999 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |authorlink=Robert Sternberg |isbn=978-0-521-57285-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and focus attention on a scientific approach to conceptualizing creativity. (It should be noted that the London School of Psychology had instigated psychometric studies of creativity as early as 1927 with the work of H. L. Hargreaves into the Faculty of Imagination,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hargreaves | first1 = H. L. | year = 1927 | title = The faculty of imagination: An enquiry concerning the existence of a general faculty, or group factor, of imagination | url = | journal = British Journal of Psychology | volume = Monograph Supplement 3 | issue = | pages = 1–74 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it did not have the same impact.) Statistical analysis led to the recognition of creativity (as measured) as a separate aspect of human cognition to [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]]-type intelligence, into which it had previously been subsumed. Guilford's work suggested that above a threshold level of IQ, the relationship between creativity and classically measured intelligence broke down.&lt;ref name="Kozbelt"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kozbelt|first=Aaron|title=The Cambridge Handbook of Creativity|year=2010|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-73025-9 |author2=Beghetto, Ronald A. |author3=Runco, Mark A.|editor=[[James C. Kaufman]] |editor2=Robert J. Sternberg|chapter=Theories of Creativity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Four C" model ===
[[James C. Kaufman]] and Beghetto introduced a "four C" model of creativity; ''mini-c'' ("transformative learning" involving "personally meaningful interpretations of experiences, actions, and insights"), ''little-c'' (everyday problem solving and creative expression), ''Pro-C'' (exhibited by people who are professionally or vocationally creative though not necessarily eminent) and ''Big-C'' (creativity considered great in the given field). This model was intended to help accommodate models and theories of creativity that stressed competence as an essential component and the historical transformation of a creative domain as the highest mark of creativity. It also, the authors argued, made a useful framework for analyzing creative processes in individuals.&lt;ref name="KaufBeg2009"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/a0013688|last=Kaufman|first=James C.|author2=Beghetto, Ronald A.|title=Beyond Big and Little: The Four C Model of Creativity|journal=[[Review of General Psychology]]|year=2009|volume=13|issue=1|pages=1–12|authorlink=James C. Kaufman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contrast of terms "Big C" and "Little c" has been widely used. Kozbelt, Beghetto and Runco use a little-c/Big-C model to review major theories of creativity.&lt;ref name=Kozbelt /&gt; [[Margaret Boden]] distinguishes between h-creativity (historical) and p-creativity (personal).&lt;ref name="Boden2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boden|first=Margaret|title=The Creative Mind: Myths And Mechanisms|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-297-82069-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Craft makes a similar distinction between "high" and "little c" creativity.&lt;ref name="Craft1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Craft|first=Anna|title=Creativity in education|year=2001|publisher=Continuum International|isbn=978-0-8264-4863-7 |editor=Craft, A. |editor2=Jeffrey, B. |editor3=Leibling, M. |chapter='Little C' creativity}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cites [[Ken Robinson (educationalist)|Ken Robinson]] as referring to "high" and "democratic" creativity. [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi]]&lt;ref name="Csik1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Csíkszentmihályi |first=Mihály|title=Creativity:Flow and the Psychology of Discovery and Invention|year=1996|publisher=Harper Collins|isbn=978-0-06-092820-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; has defined creativity in terms of those individuals judged to have made significant creative, perhaps domain-changing contributions. Simonton has analysed the career trajectories of eminent creative people in order to map patterns and predictors of creative productivity.&lt;ref name="Simonton97"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.104.1.66|last=Simonton|first=D.

== Theories of creative processes ==
There has been much empirical study in [[psychology]] and [[cognitive science]] of the processes through which creativity occurs. Interpretation of the results of these studies has led to several possible explanations of the sources and methods of creativity.

=== Incubation ===
Incubation is a temporary break from [[creative problem solving]] that can result in insight.&lt;ref name="EoC Incubation"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=S. M.|title=Encyclopedia of Creativity Volume I|year=2011|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-375039-6|pages=653–657|edition=2nd|editor=M. A. Runco |editor2=S. R. Pritzker|chapter=Incubation}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been some empirical research looking at whether, as the concept of "incubation" in [[Graham Wallas|Wallas]]' model implies, a period of interruption or rest from a problem may aid creative problem-solving. Ward&lt;ref name="Ward2003"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ward, T. |year=2003 |chapter=Creativity |editor= Nagel, L. |title=Encyclopaedia of Cognition |location=New York |publisher=Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt; lists various hypotheses that have been advanced to explain why incubation may aid creative problem-solving, and notes how some [[empirical evidence]] is consistent with the hypothesis that incubation aids creative problem-solving in that it enables "forgetting" of misleading clues. Absence of incubation may lead the problem solver to become [[fixation (psychology)|fixated]] on inappropriate strategies of solving the problem.&lt;ref name="Smith1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Steven M.|title=The Creative Cognition Approach|year=1995|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|editor=Steven M. Smith |editor2=Thomas B. Ward |editor3=Ronald A. Finke|chapter=Fixation, Incubation, and Insight in Memory and Creative Thinking}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work disputes the earlier hypothesis that creative solutions to problems arise mysteriously from the unconscious mind while the conscious mind is occupied on other tasks.&lt;ref name=Anderson2000&gt;"{{cite book |author=Anderson, J. R. |year=2000 |title=Cognitive psychology and its implications |publisher=Worth Publishers |isbn=978-0-7167-1686-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
This earlier hypothesis is discussed in [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi|Csikszentmihalyi]]'s five phase model of the creative process which describes incubation as a time that your unconscious takes over. This allows for unique connections to be made without your consciousness trying to make logical order out of the problem.&lt;ref&gt;Csikszentmihalyi, Mihaly (1996). ''Creativity : Flow and the Psychology of Discovery and Invention.'' New York: Harper Perennial. {{ISBN|0-06-092820-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Convergent and divergent thinking ===
[[J. P. Guilford]]&lt;ref name="Guilford67"&gt;{{cite book |author=Guilford, J. P. |year=1967 |title=The Nature of Human Intelligence |authorlink=J. P. Guilford}}&lt;/ref&gt; drew a distinction between convergent and divergent production (commonly renamed [[convergent thinking|convergent]] and [[divergent thinking]]). Convergent thinking involves aiming for a single, correct solution to a problem, whereas divergent thinking involves creative generation of multiple answers to a set problem. Divergent thinking is sometimes used as a synonym for creativity in psychology literature. Other researchers have occasionally used the terms ''flexible'' thinking or [[fluid and crystallized intelligence|fluid intelligence]], which are roughly similar to (but not synonymous with) creativity.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

=== Creative cognition approach ===
In 1992, Finke et al. proposed the "Geneplore" model, in which creativity takes place in two phases: a generative phase, where an individual constructs mental representations called preinventive structures, and an exploratory phase where those structures are used to come up with creative ideas. Some evidence shows that when people use their imagination to develop new ideas, those ideas are heavily structured in predictable ways by the properties of existing categories and concepts.&lt;ref name="Ward1995"&gt;Ward, T.B. (1995). What’s old about new ideas. In S. M. Smith, T. B. Ward &amp; R. A. &amp; Finke (Eds.) ''The creative cognition approach'', 157–178, London: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Weisberg&lt;ref name="Weisberg93"&gt;{{cite book |author=Weisberg, R. W. |year=1993 |title=Creativity: Beyond the myth of genius |publisher=Freeman |isbn=978-0-7167-2119-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued, by contrast, that creativity only involves ordinary cognitive processes yielding extraordinary results.

=== The Explicit–Implicit Interaction (EII) theory ===
Helie and Sun&lt;ref name="HelieSun2010"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Helie S. |author2=Sun R. | year = 2010 | title = Incubation, insight, and creative problem solving: A unified theory and a connectionist model | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 117 | issue = 3| pages = 994–1024 | doi=10.1037/a0019532 | pmid=20658861|citeseerx=10.1.1.405.2245 }}&lt;/ref&gt; recently proposed a unified framework for understanding [[creative problem-solving|creativity in problem solving]], namely the Explicit–Implicit Interaction (EII) theory of creativity. This new theory constitutes an attempt at providing a more unified explanation of relevant phenomena (in part by reinterpreting/integrating various fragmentary existing theories of [[Incubation (psychology)|incubation]] and [[insight]]).

The EII theory relies mainly on five basic principles, namely:
# The co-existence of and the difference between explicit and implicit knowledge; 
# The simultaneous involvement of implicit and explicit processes in most tasks; 
# The redundant representation of explicit and implicit knowledge; 
# The integration of the results of explicit and implicit processing;
# The iterative (and possibly bidirectional) processing. 
A computational implementation of the theory was developed based on the [[CLARION (cognitive architecture)|CLARION cognitive architecture]] and used to simulate relevant human data. This work represents an initial step in the development of process-based theories of creativity encompassing incubation, insight, and various other related phenomena.

=== Conceptual blending ===
{{Main|Conceptual blending}}
In ''[[The Act of Creation]]'', [[Arthur Koestler]] introduced the concept of ''bisociation'' — that creativity arises as a result of the intersection of two quite different frames of reference.&lt;ref name="Koestler64"&gt;{{cite book |author=Koestler, A. |title=The Act of Creation |year=1964 |authorlink=Arthur Koestler |isbn=978-0-330-73116-4 |publisher=Pan Books |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was later developed into conceptual blending. In the 1990s, various approaches in cognitive science that dealt with [[metaphor]], [[analogy]], and [[structure mapping]] have been converging, and a new integrative approach to the study of creativity in science, art and humor has emerged under the label [[conceptual blending]].

=== Honing theory ===
Honing theory, developed principally by psychologist [[Liane Gabora]], posits that creativity arises due to the self-organizing, self-mending nature of a worldview. The creative process is a way in which the individual hones (and re-hones) an integrated worldview. Honing theory places emphasis not only on the externally visible creative outcome but also the internal cognitive restructuring and repair of the worldview brought about by the creative process. When faced with a creatively demanding task, there is an interaction between the conception of the task and the worldview. The conception of the task changes through interaction with the worldview, and the worldview changes through interaction with the task. This interaction is reiterated until the task is complete, at which point not only is the task conceived of differently, but the worldview is subtly or drastically transformed as it follows the natural tendency of a worldview to attempt to resolve dissonance and seek internal consistency amongst its components, whether they be ideas, attitudes, or bits of knowledge.

A central feature of honing theory is the notion of a potentiality state.&lt;ref&gt;Gabora, L. &amp; Saab, A. (2011). Creative interference and states of potentiality in analogy problem solving. ''Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society''. July 20–23, 2011, Boston MA.&lt;/ref&gt; Honing theory posits that creative thought proceeds not by searching through and randomly ‘mutating’ predefined possibilities, but by drawing upon associations that exist due to overlap in the distributed neural cell assemblies that participate in the encoding of experiences in memory. Midway through the creative process one may have made associations between the current task and previous experiences, but not yet disambiguated which aspects of those previous experiences are relevant to the current task. Thus the creative idea may feel ‘half-baked’. It is at that point that it can be said to be in a potentiality state, because how it will actualize depends on the different internally or externally generated contexts it interacts with.

Honing theory is held to explain certain phenomena not dealt with by other theories of creativity, for example, how different works by the same creator are observed in studies to exhibit a recognizable style or 'voice' even through in different creative outlets. This is not predicted by theories of creativity that emphasize chance processes or the accumulation of expertise, but it is predicted by honing theory, according to which personal style reflects the creator's uniquely structured worldview. Another example is in the environmental stimulus for creativity. Creativity is commonly considered to be fostered by a supportive, nurturing, trustworthy environment conducive to self-actualization. However, research shows that creativity is also associated with childhood adversity, which would stimulate honing.

=== Everyday imaginative thought ===
In everyday thought, people often spontaneously imagine alternatives to reality when they think "if only...".&lt;ref&gt;Roese, N. J. &amp; Olson, J. M. (1995). ''What Might Have Been: The Social Psychology of Counterfactual Thinking''. Mahwah, New Jersey: Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt; Their [[counterfactual thinking]] is viewed as an example of everyday creative processes.&lt;ref&gt;Markman, K. Klein, W. &amp; Suhr, E. (eds) (2009). ''Handbook of mental simulation and the human imagination.'' Hove, Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed that the creation of counterfactual alternatives to reality depends on similar cognitive processes to rational thought.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ruth M. J. Byrne|Byrne, R. M. J.]] (2005). The Rational Imagination: How People Create Counterfactual Alternatives to Reality. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assessing individual creative ability ==
=== Creativity quotient ===
There was a ''creativity quotient'' developed similar to the [[intelligence quotient]] (IQ). It makes use of the results of divergent thinking tests (see below) by processing them further. It gives more weight to ideas that are radically different from other ideas in the response.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Snyder|first=Allan|date=2004|title=The creativity quotient: An objective scoring of ideational fluency|journal=Creativity Research Journal|volume=16|issue=4|pages=415–419|doi=10.1080/10400410409534552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychometric approach ===
[[J. P. Guilford]]'s group,&lt;ref name="Guilford67" /&gt; which pioneered the modern [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] study of creativity, constructed several tests to measure creativity in 1967:
* Plot Titles, where participants are given the plot of a story and asked to write original titles.
* Quick Responses is a word-association test scored for uncommonness.
* Figure Concepts, where participants were given simple drawings of objects and individuals and asked to find qualities or features that are common by two or more drawings; these were scored for uncommonness.
* Unusual Uses is finding unusual uses for common everyday objects such as bricks.
* Remote Associations, where participants are asked to find a word between two given words (e.g. Hand _____ Call)
* Remote Consequences, where participants are asked to generate a list of consequences of unexpected events (e.g. loss of gravity)

Building on Guilford's work, [[Ellis Paul Torrance|Torrance]]&lt;ref&gt;(Torrance, 1974)&lt;/ref&gt; developed the [[Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://people.uncw.edu/caropresoe/GiftedFoundations/SocialEmotional/Creativity-articles/Kim_Can-we-trust-creativity-tests.pdf|title=Can We Trust Creativity Tests?|author=Kim, Kyung Hee|year=2006|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|volume=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; They involved simple tests of divergent thinking and other problem-solving skills, which were scored on:
* '''Fluency''' – The total number of interpretable, meaningful, and relevant ideas generated in response to the stimulus.
* '''Originality''' – The statistical rarity of the responses among the test subjects.
* '''Elaboration''' – The amount of detail in the responses.

Such tests, sometimes called ''Divergent Thinking (DT)'' tests have been both supported&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kim | first1 = K.

Considerable progress has been made in automated scoring of [[divergent thinking]] tests using semantic approach. When compared to human raters, [[Natural language processing|NLP]] techniques were shown to be reliable and valid in scoring the originality.&lt;ref&gt;Forster, E. A., &amp; Dunbar, K. N. (2009). Creativity evaluation through latent semantic analysis. In Proceedings of the 31st Annual meeting of the Cognitive Science Society (pp. 602–607).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harbison, I. J., &amp; Haarmann, H. (2014). Automated scoring of originality using semantic representations. In Proceedings of the 36th Annual meeting of the Cognitive Science Society (poster paper).&lt;/ref&gt; The reported computer programs were able to achieve a correlation of 0.60 and 0.72 respectively to human graders.

Semantic networks were also used to devise originality scores that yielded significant correlations with socio-personal measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Acar | first1 = S. | last2 = Runco | first2 = M.

=== Social-personality approach ===
Some researchers have taken a social-personality approach to the measurement of creativity. In these studies, personality traits such as independence of judgement, self-confidence, attraction to complexity, aesthetic orientation, and risk-taking are used as measures of the creativity of individuals.&lt;ref name="Sternberg99" /&gt; A [[meta-analysis]] by Gregory Feist showed that creative people tend to be "more open to new experiences, less conventional and less conscientious, more self-confident, self-accepting, driven, ambitious, dominant, hostile, and impulsive." Openness, conscientiousness, self-acceptance, hostility, and impulsivity had the strongest effects of the traits listed.&lt;ref name=Feist /&gt; Within the framework of the [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five]] model of personality, some consistent traits have emerged.&lt;ref name="Batey, M. 2006 p. 355-429"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Batey | first1 = M. | last2 = Furnham | first2 = A. | year = 2006 | title = Creativity, intelligence and personality: A critical review of the scattered literature | url = | journal = Genetic, Social, and General Psychology Monographs | volume = 132 | issue = 4| pages = 355–429 | doi=10.3200/mono.132.4.355-430}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Openness to experience]] has been shown to be consistently related to a whole host of different assessments of creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Batey | first1 = M. | last2 = Furnham | first2 = A.

Compared to non-artists, artists tend to have higher levels of openness to experience and lower levels of conscientiousness, while scientists are more open to experience, [[Conscientiousness|conscientious]], and higher in the confidence-dominance facets of extraversion compared to non-scientists.&lt;ref name=Feist&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Feist | first1 = G.

=== Self-report questionnaires ===
An alternative are biographical methods. These methods use quantitative characteristics such as the number of publications, patents, or performances of a work. While this method was originally developed for highly creative personalities, today it is also available as [[Self-report study#Questionnaires and interviews|self-report questionnaires]] supplemented with frequent, less outstanding creative behaviors such as writing a short story or creating your own recipes. For example, the [[Creativity Achievement Questionnaire|Creative Achievement Questionnaire]], a self-report test that measures creative achievement across 10 domains, was described in 2005 and shown to be reliable and valid when compared to other measures of creativity and to independent evaluation of creative output.&lt;ref&gt;(Carson, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the English original, it was also used in a Chinese,&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ying-Yao|first=Wang, Chia-Chi{{!}}Ho, Hsiao-Chi{{!}}Cheng, Chih-Ling{{!}}Cheng|date=2014-00-00|title=Application of the Rasch Model to the Measurement of Creativity: The Creative Achievement Questionnaire.|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1088863|journal=Creativity Research Journal|language=en|volume=26|issue=1|issn=1040-0419}}&lt;/ref&gt; French,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bendetowicz|first=David|last2=Urbanski|first2=Marika|last3=Aichelburg|first3=Clarisse|last4=Levy|first4=Richard|last5=Volle|first5=Emmanuelle|date=2017-01|title=Brain morphometry predicts individual creative potential and the ability to combine remote ideas|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0010945216303161|journal=Cortex|volume=86|pages=216–229|doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2016.10.021|pmid=27919546|issn=0010-9452}}&lt;/ref&gt; and German-speaking&lt;ref name="Form 440–450"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Form|first=Sven|last2=Schlichting|first2=Kerrin|last3=Kaernbach|first3=Christian|date=2017-11|title=Mentoring functions: Interpersonal tensions are associated with mentees' creative achievement.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|language=en|volume=11|issue=4|pages=440–450|doi=10.1037/aca0000103|issn=1931-390X}}&lt;/ref&gt; version.

== Creativity and intelligence ==
The potential relationship between creativity and [[intelligence]] has been of interest since the late 1900s, when a multitude of influential studies – from Getzels &amp; Jackson,&lt;ref name="Getzels, J. W. 1962"&gt;Getzels, J. W., &amp; Jackson, P. W. (1962). Creativity and intelligence: Explorations with gifted students. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Barron,&lt;ref name="Barron, F. 1963"&gt;Barron, F. (1963). Creativity and psychological health. Princeton: D. Van Nostrand Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallach &amp; Kogan,&lt;ref name="Wallach, M. A. 1965"&gt;Wallach, M. A., &amp; Kogan, N. (1965). Modes of thinking in young children: A study of the creativity-intelligence distinction. New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston.&lt;/ref&gt; and Guilford&lt;ref name="Guilford, J. P. 1967"&gt;Guilford, J. P. (1967). The nature of human intelligence. New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; – focused not only on creativity, but also on intelligence. This joint focus highlights both the theoretical and practical importance of the relationship: researchers are interested not only if the constructs are related, but also how and why.&lt;ref&gt;Plucker, J., &amp; Renzulli, J. S. (1999). Psychometric approaches to the study of human creativity. In R. J. Sternberg (Ed.), Handbook of creativity (pp. 35–60). New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are multiple theories accounting for their relationship, with the 3 main theories as follows:

*Threshold Theory – Intelligence is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for creativity. There is a moderate positive relationship between creativity and intelligence until IQ ~120.&lt;ref name="Barron, F. 1963" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guilford, J. P. 1967" /&gt;
*Certification Theory – Creativity is not intrinsically related to intelligence. Instead, individuals are required to meet the requisite level intelligence in order to gain a certain level of education/work, which then in turn offers the opportunity to be creative. Displays of creativity are moderated by intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, J. R. (1989). Cognitive processes in creativity. In J. A. Glover, R. R. Ronning, &amp; C. R. Reynolds (Eds.), Handbook of creativity (pp. 135–145). New York: Plenum.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Interference Theory – Extremely high intelligence might interfere with creative ability.&lt;ref name="Sternberg, R. J. 1996"&gt;Sternberg, R. J. (1996). Successful Intelligence. NewYork: Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sternberg and O’Hara&lt;ref name="Sternberg, R. J. 1999 pp. 251"&gt;Sternberg, R. J., &amp; O’Hara, L. A. (1999). Creativity and intelligence. In R. J. Sternberg (Ed.), Handbook of creativity (pp. 251–272). Cambridge, MA: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a framework of 5 possible relationships between creativity and intelligence:
#Creativity is a subset of intelligence
#Intelligence is a subset of creativity
#Creativity and intelligence are overlapping constructs
#Creativity and intelligence are part of the same construct (coincident sets)
#Creativity and intelligence are distinct constructs (disjoint sets)

=== Creativity as a subset of intelligence ===
A number of researchers include creativity, either explicitly or implicitly, as a key component of intelligence.

''Examples of theories that include creativity as a subset of intelligence''

*Gardner’s  [[Theory of multiple intelligences]] (MIT)&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, H. (1993). Creating minds. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; – implicitly includes creativity as a subset of MIT. To demonstrate this, Gardner cited examples of different famous creators, each of whom differed in their types of intelligences e.g. Picasso (spatial intelligence); Freud (intrapersonal); Einstein (logical-mathematical); and Gandhi (interpersonal).
*Sternberg’s Theory of Successful intelligence&lt;ref name="Sternberg, R. J. 1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sternberg, R. J. 1999 pp. 251" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sternberg, R. J., Kaufman, J. C., &amp; Grigorenko, E. L. (2008). Applied intelligence. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Triarchic theory of intelligence]]) includes creativity as a main component, and comprises 3 sub-theories: Componential (Analytic), Contextual (Practical), and Experiential (Creative). Experiential sub-theory – the ability to use pre-existing knowledge and skills to solve new and novel problems – is directly related to creativity.
*The [[Cattell–Horn–Carroll theory]] includes creativity as a subset of intelligence. Specifically, it is associated with the broad group factor of long-term storage and retrieval (Glr). Glr narrow abilities relating to creativity include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kaufman | first1 = J. C. | last2 = Kaufman | first2 = S. B. | last3 = Lichtenberger | first3 = E. O. | year = 2011 | title = Finding creativity on intelligence tests via divergent production | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of School Psychology | volume = 26 | issue = | pages = 83–106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ideational fluency, associational fluency, and originality/creativity. Silvia et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Silvia | first1 = P. J. | last2 = Beaty | first2 = R. E. | last3 = Nusbaum | first3 = E.

Martindale&lt;ref&gt;Martindale, C. (1999). Biological bases of creativity. In R. J. Sternberg (Ed.), Handbook of creativity (pp. 137– 152). New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; extended the CHC-theory in the sense that it was proposed that those individuals who are creative are also selective in their processing speed Martindale argues that in the creative process, larger amounts of information are processed more slowly in the early stages, and as the individual begins to understand the problem, the processing speed is increased.
*The Dual Process Theory of Intelligence&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, J.C., Kaufman, S.B., &amp; Plucker, J.A. (2013). Contemporary theories of intelligence. In J. Reisberg (Ed.), The Oxford Handbook of Cognitive Psychology (pp. 811-822). New York, NY: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; posits a two-factor/type model of intelligence. Type 1 is a conscious process, and concerns goal directed thoughts, which are explained by ''g''. Type 2 is an unconscious process, and concerns spontaneous cognition, which encompasses daydreaming and implicit learning ability. Kaufman argues that creativity occurs as a result of Type 1 and Type 2 processes working together in combination. The use of each type in the creative process can be used to varying degrees.

=== Intelligence as a subset of creativity ===
In this relationship model, intelligence is a key component in the development of creativity.

''Theories of creativity that include intelligence as a subset of creativity''

*Sternberg &amp; Lubart’s Investment Theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sternberg | first1 = R. J. | last2 = Lubart | first2 = T. I. | year = 1991 | title = An investment theory of creativity and its development | url = | journal = Human Development | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 1–32 | doi=10.1159/000277029}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sternberg | first1 = R. J. | last2 = Lubart | first2 = T. I. | year = 1992 | title = Buy low and sell high: An investment approach to creativity | url = | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 1 | issue = 1| pages = 1–5 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.1992.tb00002.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the metaphor of a stock market, they demonstrate that creative thinkers are like good investors – they buy low and sell high (in their ideas). Like under/low-valued stock, creative individuals generate unique ideas that are initially rejected by other people. The creative individual has to persevere, and convince the others of the ideas value. After convincing the others, and thus increasing the ideas value, the creative individual ‘sells high’ by leaving the idea with the other people, and moves onto generating another idea. According to this theory, six distinct, but related elements contribute to successful creativity: intelligence, knowledge, thinking styles, personality, motivation, and environment. Intelligence is just one of the six factors that can either solely, or in conjunction with the other five factors, generate creative thoughts.
*Amabile’s Componential Model of Creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Amabile | first1 = T. M. | year = 1982 | title = Social psychology of creativity: A consensual assessment technique | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 43 | issue = 5| pages = 997–1013 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.43.5.997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amabile, T. M. (1996). Creativity in context: Update to "The Social Psychology of Creativity". Boulder: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, there are 3 within-individual components needed for creativity – domain-relevant skills, creativity-relevant processes, and task motivation – and 1 component external to the individual: their surrounding social environment. Creativity requires a confluence of all components. High creativity will result when an individual is: intrinsically motivated, possesses both a high level of domain-relevant skills and has high skills in creative thinking, and is working in a highly creative environment.
*Amusement Park Theoretical Model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baer | first1 = J. | last2 = Kaufman | first2 = J. C. | year = 2005 | title = Bridging generality and specificity: The Amusement Park Theoretical (APT) Model of creativity | url = | journal = Roeper Review | volume = 27 | issue = 3| pages = 158–163 | doi=10.1080/02783190509554310}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this 4-step theory, both domain-specific and generalist views are integrated into a model of creativity. The researchers make use of the metaphor of the amusement park to demonstrate that within each of these creative levels, intelligence plays a key role:
**To get into the amusement park, there are initial requirements (e.g., time/transport to go to the park). Initial requirements (like intelligence) are necessary, but not sufficient for creativity. They are more like prerequisites for creativity, and if an individual does not possess the basic level of the initial requirement (intelligence), then they will not be able to generate creative thoughts/behaviour.
**Secondly are the subcomponents – general thematic areas – that increase in specificity. Like choosing which type of amusement park to visit (e.g. a zoo or a water park), these areas relate to the areas in which someone could be creative (e.g. poetry).
**Thirdly, there are specific domains. After choosing the type of park to visit e.g. waterpark, you then have to choose which specific park to go to. Within the poetry domain, there are many different types (e.g. free verse, riddles, sonnet, etc.) that have to be selected from.
**Lastly, there are micro-domains. These are the specific tasks that reside within each domain e.g. individual lines in a free verse poem / individual rides at the waterpark.

=== Creativity and intelligence as overlapping yet distinct constructs ===
This possible relationship concerns creativity and intelligence as distinct, but intersecting constructs.

''Theories that include Creativity and Intelligence as Overlapping Yet Distinct Constructs''

*Renzulli’s Three-Ring Conception of Giftedness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Renzulli | first1 = J. S. | year = 1978 | title = What makes giftedness? Reexamining a definition | url = | journal = Phi Delta Kappan | volume = 60 | issue = | pages = 180–261 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this conceptualisation, giftedness occurs as a result from the overlap of above average intellectual ability, creativity, and task commitment. Under this view, creativity and intelligence are distinct constructs, but they do overlap under the correct conditions.
*[[PASS theory of intelligence]]. In this theory, the planning component – relating to the ability to solve problems, make decisions and take action – strongly overlaps with the concept of creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Naglieri | first1 = J. A. | last2 = Kaufman | first2 = J. C. | year = 2001 | title = Understanding intelligence, giftedness, and creativity using PASS theory | url = | journal = Roeper Review | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 151–156 | doi=10.1080/02783190109554087}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Threshold Theory (TT). A number of previous research findings have suggested that a threshold exists in the relationship between creativity and intelligence – both constructs are moderately positively correlated up to an IQ of ~120. Above this threshold of an IQ of 120, if there is a relationship at all, it is small and weak.&lt;ref name="Getzels, J. W. 1962" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barron, F. 1963" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Torrance, E. P. (1962). Guiding creative talent. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; TT posits that a moderate level of intelligence is necessary for creativity.

In support of the TT, Barron&lt;ref name="Barron, F. 1963" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barron, F. (1969). Creative person and creative process. New York: Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston.&lt;/ref&gt; reported finding a non-significant correlation between creativity and intelligence in a gifted sample; and a significant correlation in a non-gifted sample. Yamamoto&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yamamoto | first1 = K | year = 1964 | title = Creativity and sociometric choice among adolescents | url = | journal = Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 64 | issue = 2| pages = 249–261 | doi=10.1080/00224545.1964.9919564| pmid = 14238998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in a sample of secondary school children, reported a significant correlation between creativity and intelligence of ''r'' = .3, and reported no significant correlation when the sample consisted of gifted children. Fuchs-Beauchamp et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fuchs-Beauchamp | first1 = K. D. | last2 = Karnes | first2 = M. B. | last3 = Johnson | first3 = L.

Cho et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cho | first1 = S. H. | last2 = Nijenhuis | first2 = J. T. | last3 = van Vianen | first3 = N. E.

Jauk et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jauk | first1 = E. | last2 = Benedek | first2 = M. | last3 = Dunst | first3 = B. | last4 = Neubauer | first4 = A.

Much modern day research reports findings against TT. Wai et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wai | first1 = J. | last2 = Lubinski | first2 = D. | last3 = Benbow | first3 = C. P. | year = 2005 | title = Creativity and occupational accomplishments among intellectually precocious youths: An age 13 to age 33 longitudinal study | url = | journal = Journal of Educational Psychology | volume = 97 | issue = 3| pages = 484–492 | doi=10.1037/0022-0663.97.3.484}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a study using data from the longitudinal Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth – a cohort of elite students from early adolescence into adulthood – found that differences in SAT scores at age 13 were predictive of creative real-life outcomes 20 years later. Kim’s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kim | first1 = K. H. | year = 2005 | title = Can only intelligent people be creative? | url = | journal = Journal of Secondary Gifted Education | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 57–66 }}&lt;/ref&gt; meta-analysis of 21 studies did not find any supporting evidence for TT, and instead negligible correlations were reported between intelligence, creativity, and divergent thinking both below and above IQ's of 120. Preckel et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Preckel | first1 = F. | last2 = Holling | first2 = H. | last3 = Wiese | first3 = M. | year = 2006 | title = Relationship of intelligence and creativity in gifted and non-gifted students: An investigation of threshold theory | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 40 | issue = | pages = 159–170 | doi=10.1016/j.paid.2005.06.022}}&lt;/ref&gt; investigating fluid intelligence and creativity, reported small correlations of ''r'' = .3 to ''r'' = .4 across all levels of cognitive ability.

=== Creativity and intelligence as coincident sets ===
Under this view, researchers posit that there are no differences in the mechanisms underlying creativity in those used in normal problem solving; and in normal problem solving, there is no need for creativity. Thus, creativity and Intelligence (problem solving) are the same thing. Perkins&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, D. N. (1981) The mind’s best work. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; referred to this as the ‘nothing-special’ view.

Weisberg &amp; Alba&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weisberg | first1 = R. W. | last2 = Alba | first2 = J. W. | year = 1981 | title = An examination of the alleged role of "fixation" in the solution of several "insight" problems | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: General | volume = 110 | issue = 2| pages = 169–192 | doi=10.1037/0096-3445.110.2.169}}&lt;/ref&gt; examined problem solving by having participants complete the 9-dot problem (see [[Thinking outside the box#Nine dots puzzle]]) – where the participants are asked to connect all 9 dots in the 3 rows of 3 dots using 4 straight lines or less, without lifting their pen or tracing the same line twice. The problem can only be solved if the lines go outside the boundaries of the square of dots. Results demonstrated that even when participants were given this insight, they still found it difficult to solve the problem, thus showing that to successfully complete the task it is not just insight (or creativity) that is required.

=== Creativity and intelligence as disjoint sets ===
In this view, creativity and intelligence are completely different, unrelated constructs.

Getzels and Jackson&lt;ref name="Getzels, J. W. 1962" /&gt; administered 5 creativity measures to a group of 449 children from grades 6-12, and compared these test findings to results from previously administered (by the school) IQ tests. They found that the correlation between the creativity measures and IQ was ''r'' = .26. The high creativity group scored in the top 20% of the overall creativity measures, but were not included in the top 20% of IQ scorers. The high intelligence group scored the opposite: they scored in the top 20% for IQ, but were outside the top 20% scorers for creativity, thus showing that creativity and intelligence are distinct and unrelated.

However, this work has been heavily criticised. Wallach and Kogan&lt;ref name="Wallach, M. A. 1965" /&gt; highlighted that the creativity measures were not only weakly related to one another (to the extent that they were no more related to one another than they were with IQ), but they seemed to also draw upon non-creative skills. McNemar&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McNemar | first1 = O | year = 1964 | title = Lost: Our Intelligence? Why? | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 19 | issue = 12| pages = 871–882 | doi=10.1037/h0042008}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted that there were major measurement issues, in that the IQ scores were a mixture from 3 different IQ tests.

Wallach and Kogan&lt;ref name="Wallach, M. A. 1965" /&gt; administered 5 measures of creativity, each of which resulted in a score for originality and fluency; and 10 measures of general intelligence to 151 5th grade children. These tests were untimed, and given in a game-like manner (aiming to facilitate creativity). Inter-correlations between creativity tests were on average ''r'' = .41. Inter-correlations between intelligence measures were on average ''r'' = .51 with each other. Creativity tests and intelligence measures correlated ''r'' = .09.

The authors write that "creative innovation might require coactivation and communication between regions of the brain that ordinarily are not strongly connected." Highly creative people who excel at creative innovation tend to differ from others in three ways:
* they have a high level of specialized knowledge,
* they are capable of [[convergent and divergent production|divergent thinking]] mediated by the [[frontal lobe]].
* and they are able to modulate [[neurotransmitter]]s such as [[norepinephrine]] in their frontal lobe.

Thus, the frontal lobe appears to be the part of the [[cerebral cortex|cortex]] that is most important for creativity.

This article also explored the links between creativity and sleep, [[mood disorder|mood]] and [[substance dependence|addiction disorders]], and [[depression (mood)|depression]].

In 2005, Alice Flaherty presented a three-factor model of the creative drive. Drawing from evidence in brain imaging, drug studies and lesion analysis, she described the creative drive as resulting from an interaction of the frontal lobes, the [[temporal lobe]]s, and [[dopamine]] from the [[limbic system]]. The frontal lobes can be seen as responsible for idea generation, and the temporal lobes for idea editing and evaluation. Abnormalities in the frontal lobe (such as depression or anxiety) generally decrease creativity, while abnormalities in the temporal lobe often increase creativity. High activity in the temporal lobe typically inhibits activity in the frontal lobe, and vice versa. High dopamine levels increase general [[arousal]] and goal directed behaviors and reduce [[latent inhibition]], and all three effects increase the drive to generate ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Flaherty AW | year = 2005 | title = Frontotemporal and dopaminergic control of idea generation and creative drive | url = | journal = J Comp Neurol | volume = 493 | issue = 1| pages = 147–53 | pmid = 16254989 | pmc = 2571074 | doi=10.1002/cne.20768}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2015 study on creativity found that it involves the interaction of multiple neural networks, including those that support associative thinking, along with other [[default mode network]] functions.&lt;ref name=PMID_26003860&gt;{{ cite journal |last1 = Mayseless |first1 = Naama |last2 = Eran |first2 = Ayelet |last3 = Shamay-Tsoory |first3 = Simone G |year = 2015 |title = Generating original ideas: The neural underpinning of originality. |journal = NeuroImage |quote = These results are in line with the dual model of creativity, according to which original ideas are a product of the interaction between a system that generates ideas and a control system that evaluates these ideas. |laysummary = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26003860 |doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.05.030|pmid = 26003860 |pages = 232–9 |volume = 116 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Working memory and the cerebellum ===
Vandervert&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert 2003a, 2003b; Vandervert, Schimpf &amp; Liu, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; described how the brain's frontal lobes and the cognitive functions of the [[cerebellum]] collaborate to produce creativity and innovation. Vandervert's explanation rests on considerable evidence that all processes of [[working memory]] (responsible for processing all thought&lt;ref&gt;Miyake &amp; Shah, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;) are adaptively modeled for increased efficiency by the cerebellum.&lt;ref&gt;Schmahmann, 1997, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The cerebellum (consisting of 100 billion neurons, which is more than the entirety of the rest of the brain&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, Korbo &amp; Pakkenberg, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;) is also widely known to adaptively model all bodily movement for efficiency. The cerebellum's adaptive models of working memory processing are then fed back to especially frontal lobe working memory control processes&lt;ref&gt;Miller &amp; Cohen, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; where creative and innovative thoughts arise.&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert, 2003a&lt;/ref&gt; (Apparently, creative insight or the "aha" experience is then triggered in the temporal lobe.&lt;ref&gt;Jung-Beeman, Bowden, Haberman, Frymiare, Arambel-Liu, Greenblatt, Reber &amp; Kounios, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;)

According to Vandervert, the details of creative adaptation begin in "forward" cerebellar models which are anticipatory/exploratory controls for movement and thought. These cerebellar processing and control architectures have been termed Hierarchical Modular Selection and Identification for Control (HMOSAIC).&lt;ref&gt;Imamizu, Kuroda, Miyauchi, Yoshioka &amp; Kawato, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; New, hierarchically arranged levels of the cerebellar control architecture (HMOSAIC) develop as mental mulling in working memory is extended over time. These new levels of the control architecture are fed forward to the frontal lobes. Since the cerebellum adaptively models all movement and all levels of thought and emotion,&lt;ref&gt;Schmahmann, 2004,&lt;/ref&gt; Vandervert's approach helps explain creativity and innovation in sports, art, music, the design of video games, technology, mathematics, the [[child prodigy]], and thought in general.

Essentially, Vandervert has argued that when a person is confronted with a challenging new situation, visual-spatial working memory and speech-related working memory are decomposed and re-composed (fractionated) by the cerebellum and then blended in the cerebral cortex in an attempt to deal with the new situation. With repeated attempts to deal with challenging situations, the cerebro-cerebellar blending process continues to optimize the efficiency of how working memory deals with the situation or problem.&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert, in press-a&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently, he has argued that this is the same process (only involving visual-spatial working memory and pre-language vocalization) that led to the evolution of language in humans.&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert, 2011, in press-b&lt;/ref&gt; Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers have pointed out that this blending process, because it continuously optimizes efficiencies, constantly improves prototyping attempts toward the invention or innovation of new ideas, music, art, or technology.&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert &amp; Vandervert-Weathers, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Prototyping, they argue, not only produces new products, it trains the cerebro-cerebellar pathways involved to become more efficient at prototyping itself. Further, Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers believe that this repetitive "mental prototyping" or mental rehearsal involving the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex explains the success of the self-driven, individualized patterning of repetitions initiated by the teaching methods of the [[Khan Academy]]. The model proposed by Vandervert has, however, received incisive critique from several authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = J. | year = 2007 | title = On Vandervert et al.

=== REM sleep ===
Creativity involves the forming of associative elements into new combinations that are useful or meet some requirement. Sleep aids this process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature02223 |author1=Wagner U. |author2=Gais S. |author3=Haider H. |author4=Verleger R. |author5=Born J. | year = 2004 | title = Sleep inspires insight | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 427 | issue = 6972| pages = 352–5 | pmid = 14737168 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rapid eye movement sleep|REM]] rather than [[Non-rapid eye movement sleep|NREM sleep]] appears to be responsible.&lt;ref name="Cai"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0900271106 |author1=Cai D.

It is proposed that REM sleep adds creativity by allowing "neocortical structures to reorganize associative hierarchies, in which information from the hippocampus would be reinterpreted in relation to previous semantic representations or nodes."&lt;ref name="Cai" /&gt;

== Affect ==
Some theories suggest that creativity may be particularly susceptible to affective influence. As noted in [[voting behavior]], the term "affect" in this context can refer to liking or disliking key aspects of the subject in question. This work largely follows from findings in psychology regarding the ways in which affective states are involved in human judgment and decision-making.&lt;ref name=Winkielman2007&gt;{{Citation

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Positive affect relations ===
According to [[Alice M. Isen|Alice Isen]], positive affect has three primary effects on cognitive activity:
# Positive affect makes additional cognitive material available for processing, increasing the number of cognitive elements available for association;
# Positive affect leads to defocused attention and a more complex cognitive context, increasing the breadth of those elements that are treated as relevant to the problem;
# Positive affect increases cognitive flexibility, increasing the probability that diverse cognitive elements will in fact become associated. Together, these processes lead positive affect to have a positive influence on creativity.

[[Barbara Fredrickson]] in her [[broaden-and-build]] model suggests that positive emotions such as joy and love broaden a person's available repertoire of cognitions and actions, thus enhancing creativity.

According to these researchers, positive emotions increase the number of cognitive elements available for association (attention scope) and the number of elements that are relevant to the problem (cognitive scope).

Various meta-analyses, such as Baas et al. (2008) of 66 studies about creativity and affect support the link between creativity and positive affect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mark A.

== Creativity and artificial intelligence ==
[[Jürgen Schmidhuber]]'s formal [[theory]] of creativity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidhuber | first1 = Jürgen | year = 2006 | title = Developmental Robotics, Optimal Artificial Curiosity, Creativity, Music, and the Fine Arts | url = | journal = Connection Science | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 173–187 | doi=10.1080/09540090600768658| citeseerx = 10.1.1.474.6919 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidhuber | first1 = Jürgen | year = 2010 | title = Formal Theory of Creativity, Fun, and Intrinsic Motivation (1990–2010) | url = | journal = IEEE Transactions on Autonomous Mental Development | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 230–247 | doi=10.1109/tamd.2010.2056368}}&lt;/ref&gt; postulates that creativity, curiosity, and interestingness are by-products of a simple [[Computational learning theory|computational]] principle for measuring and optimizing learning progress. Consider an agent able to manipulate its environment and thus its own [[sensory system|sensory]] inputs. The agent can use a [[black box]] optimization method such as [[reinforcement learning]] to learn (through informed trial and error) sequences of actions that maximize the expected sum of its future [[reward system|reward]] signals. There are extrinsic reward signals for achieving externally given goals, such as finding food when hungry. But Schmidhuber's [[Loss function|objective function]] to be maximized also includes an additional, intrinsic term to model "wow-effects." This non-standard term motivates purely creative behavior of the agent even when there are no external goals. A wow-effect is formally defined as follows. As the agent is creating and predicting and encoding the continually growing history of actions and sensory inputs, it keeps improving the predictor or encoder, which can be implemented as an [[artificial neural network]] or some other [[machine learning]] device that can exploit regularities in the data to improve its performance over time. The improvements can be measured precisely, by computing the difference in computational costs (storage size, number of required synapses, errors, time) needed to encode new observations before and after learning. This difference depends on the encoder's present subjective knowledge, which changes over time, but the theory formally takes this into account. The cost difference measures the strength of the present "wow-effect" due to sudden improvements in [[data compression]] or computational speed. It becomes an intrinsic reward signal for the action selector. The objective function thus motivates the action optimizer to create action sequences causing more wow-effects. Irregular, random data (or noise) do not permit any wow-effects or learning progress, and thus are "boring" by nature (providing no reward). Already known and predictable regularities also are boring. Temporarily interesting are only the initially unknown, novel, regular patterns in both actions and observations. This motivates the agent to perform continual, open-ended, active, creative exploration.

According to Schmidhuber, his objective function explains the activities of scientists, artists, and [[comedian]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Video of [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]]'s keynote at the 2011 Winter Intelligence Conference, Oxford: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnbZzcruGu0 Universal AI and Theory of Fun and Creativity.

Youtube, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, [[physicist]]s are motivated to create experiments leading to observations obeying previously unpublished [[physical law]]s permitting better [[data compression]]. Likewise, composers receive intrinsic reward for creating non-arbitrary melodies with unexpected but regular harmonies that permit wow-effects through data compression improvements.
Similarly, a comedian gets intrinsic reward for "inventing a novel joke with an unexpected [[punch line]], related to the beginning of the story in an initially unexpected but quickly learnable way that also allows for better compression of the perceived data."&lt;ref&gt;Kurzweil AI: [http://www.kurzweilai.net/when-creative-machines-overtake-man Transcript] of [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]]'s TEDx talk (2012): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ35zNlyG-o&amp;list=PL194623EBA834DB77&amp;index=11 When creative machines overtake man]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mental health ==
{{Main|Creativity and mental illness}}
A study by psychologist [[J. Philippe Rushton]] found creativity to correlate with [[intelligence]] and [[psychoticism]].&lt;ref&gt;(Rushton, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found creativity to be greater in [[Schizotypal personality disorder|schizotypal]] than in either normal or [[Schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] individuals. While divergent thinking was associated with bilateral activation of the [[prefrontal cortex]], schizotypal individuals were found to have much greater activation of their ''right'' prefrontal cortex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.schres.2005.06.016 |pmid=16125369 |url=http://exploration.vanderbilt.edu/news/news_schizotypes.htm |accessdate=2006-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060215212520/http://exploration.vanderbilt.edu/news/news_schizotypes.htm |archivedate=2006-02-15 |df= |volume=80 |issue=2–3 |title=Verbal creativity and schizotypal personality in relation to prefrontal hemispheric laterality: A behavioral and near-infrared optical imaging study |year=2005 |journal=Schizophrenia Research |pages=271–282 | last1 = Folley | first1 = Bradley S. | last2 = Park | first2 = Sohee|pmc=2817946 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This study hypothesizes that such individuals are better at accessing both hemispheres, allowing them to make novel associations at a faster rate.

Particularly strong links have been identified between creativity and [[mood disorder]]s, particularly [[Bipolar disorder|manic-depressive disorder]] (a.k.a. [[bipolar disorder]]) and [[Major depressive disorder|depressive disorder]] (a.k.a. [[Major depressive disorder|unipolar disorder]]). In ''Touched with Fire: Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament'', [[Kay Redfield Jamison]] summarizes studies of mood-disorder rates in [[writer]]s, [[poet]]s, and [[artist]]s. She also explores research that identifies [[mood disorder]]s in such famous writers and artists as [[Ernest Hemingway]] (who shot himself after [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electroconvulsive treatment]]), [[Virginia Woolf]] (who drowned herself when she felt a depressive episode coming on), composer [[Robert Schumann]] (who died in a mental institution), and even the famed [[Visual arts|visual artist]] [[Michelangelo]]. A different case study suggested for Schumann a difference between bipolar disorder and "creative bipolarity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holm-Hadulla|first=Rainer Matthias|last2=Koutsoukou-Argyraki|first2=Asimina|date=2017|title=Bipolar Disorder and/or Creative Bipolarity: Robert Schumann's Exemplary Psychopathology - Combining Symptomatological and Psychosocial Perspectives with Creativity Research|url=https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/479883|journal=Psychopathology|language=english|volume=50|issue=6|pages=379–388|doi=10.1159/000479883|pmid=29017153|issn=0254-4962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study looking at 300,000 persons with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or unipolar depression, and their relatives, found overrepresentation in creative professions for those with bipolar disorder as well as for undiagnosed siblings of those with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.

There was no association for those with unipolar depression or their relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kyaga | first1 = S. | last2 = Lichtenstein | first2 = P. | last3 = Boman | first3 = M. | last4 = Hultman | first4 = C. | last5 = Långström | first5 = N. | last6 = Landén | first6 = M. | title = Creativity and mental disorder: Family study of 300 000 people with severe mental disorder | doi = 10.1192/bjp.bp.110.085316 | journal = The British Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 199 | issue = 5 | pages = 373–379 | year = 2011 | pmid =  21653945| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another case study suggested a difference between severe mood disorders and "creative melancholy", pointing out mild and moderate depression may inspire creative achievements while severe depression inhibits and may even destroy creative activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holm-Hadulla|first=Rainer M.|last2=Roussel|first2=Martin|last3=Hofmann|first3=Frank-Hagen|date=2010-12|title=Depression and creativity — The case of the german poet, scientist and statesman J.

Another study involving more than one million people, conducted by Swedish researchers at the Karolinska Institute, reported a number of correlations between creative occupations and mental illnesses. Writers had a higher risk of anxiety and bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, unipolar depression, and substance abuse, and were almost twice as likely as the general population to kill themselves. Dancers and photographers were also more likely to have bipolar disorder.&lt;ref name="bbc health-19959565"&gt;Roberts, Michelle. Creativity 'closely entwined with mental illness'. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-19959565. 16 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as a group, those in the creative professions were no more likely to suffer from psychiatric disorders than other people, although they were more likely to have a close relative with a disorder, including anorexia and, to some extent, autism, the Journal of Psychiatric Research reports.&lt;ref name="bbc health-19959565" /&gt;

According to psychologist Robert Epstein, PhD, creativity can be obstructed through stress.&lt;ref name="apa.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/gradpsych/2009/01/creativity.aspx|title=The science of creativity|website=apa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Creativity and personality ==
Creativity can be expressed in a number of different forms, depending on unique people and environments. A number of different theorists have suggested models of the creative person. One model suggests that there are kinds to produce growth, innovation, speed, etc. These are referred to as the four "Creativity Profiles" that can help achieve such goals.&lt;ref&gt;(DeGraff, Lawrence 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;
:(i) ''Incubate'' (Long-term Development)
:(ii) ''Imagine'' (Breakthrough Ideas)
:(iii) ''Improve'' (Incremental Adjustments)
:(iv) ''Invest'' (Short-term Goals)

Research by Dr Mark Batey of the Psychometrics at Work Research Group at [[Manchester Business School]] has suggested that the creative profile can be explained by four primary creativity traits with narrow facets within each

: (i) "Idea Generation" (Fluency, Originality, Incubation and Illumination)
: (ii) "Personality" (Curiosity and Tolerance for Ambiguity)
: (iii) "Motivation" (Intrinsic, Extrinsic and Achievement)
: (iv) "Confidence" (Producing, Sharing and Implementing)

This model was developed in a sample of 1000 working adults using the statistical techniques of Exploratory Factor Analysis followed by Confirmatory Factor Analysis by Structural Equation Modelling.&lt;ref&gt;(Batey &amp; Irwing, 2010) {{cite web |url=http://www.e-metrixx.com/creativity-profit/me2-spec/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710161255/http://www.e-metrixx.com/creativity-profit/me2-spec/ |archivedate=2011-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important aspect of the creativity profiling approach is to account for the tension between predicting the creative profile of an individual, as characterised by the [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] approach, and the evidence that team creativity is founded on diversity and difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Nijstad B. A. |author2=De Dreu C.

One characteristic of creative people, as measured by some psychologists, is what is called ''divergent production''. ''Divergent production'' is the ability of a person to generate a diverse assortment, yet an appropriate amount of responses to a given situation.&lt;ref&gt;(Guilford, 1950)&lt;/ref&gt; One way of measuring ''divergent production'' is by administering the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking.&lt;ref&gt;(Torrance, 1974, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt; The Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking assesses the diversity, quantity, and appropriateness of participants responses to a variety of open-ended questions.

Other researchers of creativity see the difference in creative people as a cognitive process of dedication to problem solving and developing expertise in the field of their creative expression. Hard working people study the work of people before them and within their current area, become experts in their fields, and then have the ability to add to and build upon previous information in innovative and creative ways. In a study of projects by design students, students who had more knowledge on their subject on average had greater creativity within their projects.&lt;ref&gt;(Christiaans &amp; Venselaar, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The aspect of motivation within a person's personality may predict creativity levels in the person. Motivation stems from two different sources, intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation is an internal drive within a person to participate or invest as a result of personal interest, desires, hopes, goals, etc. Extrinsic motivation is a drive from outside of a person and might take the form of payment, rewards, fame, approval from others, etc. Although extrinsic motivation and intrinsic motivation can both increase creativity in certain cases, strictly extrinsic motivation often impedes creativity in people.&lt;ref&gt;(Amabile, 1996; Prabhu et al., 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

From a personality-traits perspective, there are a number of traits that are associated with creativity in people.&lt;ref&gt;(Feist, 1998, 1999; Prabhu et al., 2008; Zhang &amp; Sternberg, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Creative people tend to be more open to new experiences, are more self-confident, are more ambitious, self-accepting, impulsive, driven, dominant, and hostile, compared to people with less creativity.

From an evolutionary perspective, creativity may be a result of the outcome of years of generating ideas. As ideas are continuously generated, the need to evolve produces a need for new ideas and developments. As a result, people have been creating and developing new, innovative, and creative ideas to build our progress as a society.&lt;ref&gt;(Campbell, 1960)&lt;/ref&gt;

In studying exceptionally creative people in history, some common traits in lifestyle and environment are often found. Creative people in history usually had supportive parents, but rigid and non-nurturing. Most had an interest in their field at an early age, and most had a highly supportive and skilled mentor in their field of interest. Often the field they chose was relatively uncharted, allowing for their creativity to be expressed more in a field with less previous information. Most exceptionally creative people devoted almost all of their time and energy into their craft, and after about a decade had a creative breakthrough of fame. Their lives were marked with extreme dedication and a cycle of hard-work and breakthroughs as a result of their determination.&lt;ref&gt;(Gardner, 1993a, Policastro &amp; Gardner, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theory of creative people is the ''investment theory of creativity''. This approach suggest that there are many individual and environmental factors that must exist in precise ways for extremely high levels of creativity opposed to average levels of creativity. In the ''investment'' sense, a person with their particular characteristics in their particular environment may see an opportunity to devote their time and energy into something that has been overlooked by others. The creative person develops an undervalued or under-recognised idea to the point that it is established as a new and creative idea. Just like in the financial world, some investments are worth the buy in, while others are less productive and do not build to the extent that the investor expected. This ''investment theory of creativity'' views creativity in a unique perspective compared to others, by asserting that creativity might rely to some extent on the right investment of effort being added to a field at the right time in the right way.&lt;ref&gt;(Sternberg &amp; Lubart, 1991, 1995, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Malevolent creativity ==
Malevolent creativity (MC) focuses on the "darker side" of creativity.&lt;ref name="The dark side of creativity"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McLaren | first1 = R. B. | year = 1993 | title = The dark side of creativity | url = | journal = Creat. Res. J. | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 137–144 | doi = 10.1080/10400419309534472 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of creativity is not typically accepted within society and is defined by the intention to cause harm to others through original and innovative means. MC should be distinguished from negative creativity in that negative creativity may unintentionally cause harm to others, whereas MC is explicitly malevolently motivated. MC is often a key contributor to crime and in its most destructive form can even manifest as terrorism. However, MC can also be observed in ordinary day-to-day life as lying, cheating and betrayal.&lt;ref name="Measure Malevolent Creativity 2016"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hao | first1 = N | last2 = Tang | first2 = M | last3 = Yang | first3 = J | last4 = Wang | first4 = Q | last5 = Runco | first5 = MA | year = 2016 | title = A New Tool to Measure Malevolent Creativity: The Malevolent Creativity Behavior Scale | url = | journal = Frontiers in Psychology | volume = 7 | issue = | page = 682 | doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00682 | pmid = 27242596 | pmc = 4870273 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although everyone shows some levels of MC under certain conditions, those that have a higher propensity towards malevolent creativity have increased tendencies to deceive and manipulate others to their own gain. Although levels of MC appear to dramatically increase when an individual is placed under unfair conditions, personality is also a key predictor in anticipating levels of malevolent thinking. Researches Harris and Reiter-Palmon investigated the role of aggression in levels of MC, in particular levels of implicit aggression and the tendency to employ aggressive actions in response to problem solving.  The personality traits of physical aggression, conscientiousness, emotional intelligence and implicit aggression all seem to be related with MC.&lt;ref name="The dark side of creativity"/&gt; Harris and Reiter-Palmon's research showed that when subjects were presented with a problem that triggered malevolent creativity, participants high in implicit aggression and low in premeditation expressed the largest number of malevolently-themed solutions. When presented with the more benign problem that triggered prosocial motives of helping others and cooperating, those high in implicit aggression, even if they were high in impulsiveness, were far less destructive in their imagined solutions. They concluded premeditation, more than implicit aggression controlled an individual’s expression of malevolent creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harris | first1 = D.

The current measure for malevolent creativity is the 13 item test Malevolent Creativity Behaviour Scale (MCBS) &lt;ref name="Measure Malevolent Creativity 2016"/&gt;

===Malevolent creativity and crime===
Malevolent creativity has strong links with crime. As creativity requires deviating from the conventional, there is a permanent tension between being creative and producing products that go too far and in some cases to the point of breaking the law. Aggression is a key predictor of malevolent creativity, and studies have also shown that increased levels of aggression also correlates to a higher likelihood of committing crime.&lt;ref&gt;Aggression: A social psychological analysis.

== Creativity across cultures ==
Creativity is viewed differently in different countries.&lt;ref&gt;Sternberg RJ 'Introduction' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (2006) (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' pp 1-9. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, cross-cultural research centred on [[Hong Kong]] found that Westerners view creativity more in terms of the individual attributes of a creative person, such as their aesthetic taste, while Chinese people view creativity more in terms of the social influence of creative people e.g. what they can contribute to society.&lt;ref&gt;Niu W (2006) 'Development of Creativity Research in Chinese Societies' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' pp 386-387. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mpofu et al. surveyed 28 African languages and found that 27 had no word which directly translated to 'creativity' (the exception being [[Arabic]]).&lt;ref&gt;Mpofu E et al (2006) 'African Perspectives on Creativity' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' p 465. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of [[linguistic relativity]], i.e. that language can affect thought, suggests that the lack of an equivalent word for 'creativity' may affect the views of creativity among speakers of such languages. However, more research would be needed to establish this, and there is certainly no suggestion that this linguistic difference makes people any less (or more) creative; [[Africa]] has a rich heritage of creative pursuits such as [[music]], [[art]], and [[storytelling]]. Nevertheless, it is true that there has been very little research on creativity in Africa,&lt;ref&gt;Mpofu E et al (2006) 'African Perspectives on Creativity' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' p 458. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there has also been very little research on creativity in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;Preiss DD and Strasser K (2006) 'Creativity in Latin America' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' p 46. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creativity has been more thoroughly researched in the northern hemisphere, but here again there are cultural differences, even between countries or groups of countries in close proximity. For example, in Scandinavian countries, creativity is seen as an individual attitude which helps in coping with life's challenges,&lt;ref&gt;Smith GJW and Carlsson I (2006) 'Creativity under the Northern Lights' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' p 202. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in Germany, creativity is seen more as a process that can be applied to help solve problems.&lt;ref&gt;Preiser S (2006) 'Creativity Research in German-Speaking Countries' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' p 175. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In organizations ==
[[File:Training meeting in a ecodesign stainless steel company in brazil.JPG|thumb|right|Training meeting in an eco-design stainless steel company in [[Brazil]]. The leaders among other things wish to cheer and encourage the workers in order to achieve a higher level of creativity.]]

It has been the topic of various research studies to establish that organizational effectiveness depends on the creativity of the workforce to a large extent. For any given organization, measures of effectiveness vary, depending upon its mission, environmental context, nature of work, the product or service it produces, and customer demands. Thus, the first step in evaluating organizational effectiveness is to understand the organization itself — how it functions, how it is structured, and what it emphasizes.

Amabile&lt;ref name="Amabile98"&gt;(Amabile, 1998; Sullivan and Harper, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; argued that to enhance creativity in business, three components were needed:
* Expertise (technical, procedural and intellectual knowledge),
* Creative thinking skills (how flexibly and imaginatively people approach problems),
* and Motivation (especially [[intrinsic motivation]]).

There are two types of motivation:
* [[Motivation|extrinsic motivation]] – [[Externality|external]] factors, for example [[threat]]s of being fired or money as a reward,
* [[intrinsic motivation]] – comes from inside an individual, satisfaction, enjoyment of work, etc.

Six managerial practices to encourage motivation are:
* Challenge – matching people with the right assignments;
* Freedom – giving people [[autonomy]] choosing means to achieve goals;
* [[Resource]]s – such as time, money, space, etc. There must be balance fit among resources and people;
* Work group features – [[Cultural diversity|diverse]], supportive teams, where members share the excitement, willingness to help, and recognize each other's talents;
* [[Supervisor]]y encouragement – recognitions, cheering, praising;
* Organizational support – value emphasis, information sharing, [[collaboration]].

Nonaka, who examined several successful Japanese companies, similarly saw creativity and knowledge creation as being important to the success of organizations.&lt;ref name="Nonaka91"&gt;(Nonaka, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, he emphasized the role that [[tacit knowledge]] has to play in the creative process.

In business, [[originality]] is not enough. The idea must also be appropriate—useful and [[Cause of action|actionable]].&lt;ref&gt;Amabile, T. M. (1998). "How to kill creativity". Harvard Business Review&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Siltala, R. 2010. Innovativity and cooperative learning in business life and teaching. University of Turku&lt;/ref&gt; [[Competitive intelligence|Creative competitive intelligence]] is a new solution to solve this problem. According to Reijo Siltala it links creativity to [[innovation]] process and [[competitive intelligence]] to creative workers.

Creativity can be encouraged in people and professionals and in the workplace. It is essential for innovation, and is a factor affecting economic growth and businesses. In 2013, the sociologist Silvia Leal Martín, using the Innova 3DX method, suggested measuring the various parameters that encourage creativity and innovation: corporate culture, work environment, leadership and management, creativity, self-esteem and optimism, locus of control and learning orientation, motivation, and fear.&lt;ref&gt;Leal, S. y Urrea J. "Ingenio y Pasión" (2013), Lid Publishers (Spanish) and Forbes India Magazine http://forbesindia.com/article/ie/new-trends-in-innovation-management/33905/1#ixzz2iiuuDxVq&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, social psychologists, organizational scientists, and management scientists who conduct extensive research on the factors that influence creativity and innovation in teams and organizations have developed integrative theoretical models that emphasize the roles of team composition, team processes, and organizational culture, as well as the mutually reinforcing relationships between them in promoting innovation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Woodman | first1 = R.

The investigation by Loo (2017) &lt;ref&gt;Loo, S. (2017) Creative Working in the Knowledge Economy. Abingdon, Oxfordshire: Routledge Ltd. {{ISBN|9781138211391}}; {{ISBN|9781315453095}}. https://www.routledge.com/Creative-Working-in-the-Knowledge-Economy/Loo/p/book/9781138211391&lt;/ref&gt; on creative working in the knowledge economy brings together studies of creativity as delineated in this web page. It offers connections with the sections on the ‘”Four C” model’, ‘Theories of creative processes’, ‘Creativity as a subset of intelligence’, ‘Creativity and personality’, and ‘In organisations’ It is the last section that the investigation addresses.

Research studies of the knowledge economy may be classified into three levels: macro, meso and micro. Macro studies refer to investigations at a societal or transnational dimension. Meso studies focus on organisations. Micro investigations centre on the minutiae workings of workers. There is also an interdisciplinary dimension such as research from businesses (e.g. Burton-Jones, 1999; Drucker, 1999), economics (e.g. Cortada, 1998; Reich, 2001; Florida, 2003), education (e.g. Farrell and Fenwick, 2007; Brown, Lauder and Ashton, 2011), human resource management (e.g. Davenport, 2005), knowledge and organizational management (Alvesson, 2004; Defillippi, Arthur and Lindsay, 2006; Orr, Nutley, Russell, Bain, Hacking and Moran, 2016), sociology, psychology, and knowledge economy-related sectors – especially information technology (IT) software (e.g. O’Riain, 2004; Nerland, 2008) and advertising (e.g. Grabher, 2004; Lury, 2004) (Loo, 2017).

Loo (2017) studies how individual workers in the knowledge economy use their creativity and know-how in the advertising and IT software sectors. It examines this phenomenon across three developed countries of England, Japan and Singapore to observe global perspectives. Specifically, the study uses qualitative data from semi-structured interviews of the related professionals in the roles of creative directing and copywriting (in advertising), and systems software developing and software programme managing.

The study offers a conceptual framework (Loo, 2017, p.&amp;nbsp;49) of a two-dimensional matrix of individual and collaborative working styles, and single and multi-contexts. The investigation draws on literature sources from the four disciplines of economics (e.g. Reich, 2001; Quah, 2002), management (e.g. ,Drucker, 1994; Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995; von Hippel, 2006), sociology (e.g. Zuboff, 1988; Bell, 1973; Lash and Urry, 1994; Castells, 2000; Knorr Cetina, 2005),  and psychology (e.g. Gardner, 1984; Csikszentmihalyi, 1988; Sternberg, Kaufman and Pretz, 2004). The themes arising from the analysis of knowledge work and creativity literature serve to create a distinct theoretical framework of creative knowledge work.  These workers apply their cognitive abilities, creative personalities and skill sets in the areas of science, technology, or culture industries to invent or discover new possibilities – e.g. a medium, product or service. These work activities may be done individually or collectively. Education, training and ‘encultured environments’ are necessary for the performance of these creative activities. Acts of creativity are viewed as asking new questions over and above those questions asked by an intelligent person, seeking novelty when reviewing a situation (Gardner, 1993), and creating something that is different and novel, i.e. a ‘variation’ on the idea of existing ideas in a domain (Csikszentmihalyi, 1988). This framework is evidenced by the empirical chapters on the micro-workings of creative workers in the two knowledge economy sectors from global perspectives.

This investigation identifies a definition of creative work, three types of work and the necessary conditions for it to occur. These workers use a combination of creative applications including anticipatory imagination, problem-solving, problem seeking, and generating ideas and aesthetic sensibilities. Taking aesthetic sensibilities as an example, for a creative director in the advertising industry, it is a visual imagery whether still or moving via a camera lens, and for a software programmer, it is the innovative technical expertise in which the software is written. There are specific creative applications for each of the sectors such as emotional connection in the advertising sector, and the power of expression and sensitivity in the IT software sector. In addition to the creative applications, creative workers require abilities and aptitudes to carry out their roles. Passion for one’s job is generic. For copywriters, this passion is identified with fun, enjoyment and happiness alongside attributes such as honesty (regarding the product), confidence, and patience in finding the appropriate copy. Knowledge is also required in the disciplines of the humanities (e.g. literature), the creative arts (e.g. painting and music) and technical-related know-how (e.g. mathematics, computer sciences and physical sciences). In the IT software, technical knowledge of computer languages (e.g. C++) is especially significant for programmers whereas the degree of technical expertise may be less for a programme manager, as only knowledge of the relevant language is necessary to understand the issues for communicating with the team of developers and testers.

There are three types of work. One is intra-sectoral (e.g. ‘general sponge’ and ’in tune with the zeitgeist’ [advertising], and ‘power of expression’ and ‘sensitivity’ [IT software]). The second is inter-sectoral (e.g. ‘integration of advertising activities’ [advertising], and ‘autonomous decentralized systems’ [ADS] [IT software]). The third relates to changes in culture/practices in the sectors (e.g. ‘three-dimensional trust’ and ‘green credentials’ [advertising], and ‘collaboration with HEIs and industry’ and ‘ADS system in the Tokyo train operator’ [IT software]).

The necessary conditions for creative work to exist are a supportive environment such as supportive information, communications and electronic technologies (ICET) infrastructure, training, work environment and education.

This investigation has implications for lifelong learning of these workers informally and formally. Teaching institutions need to offer multi-disciplinary knowledge of humanities, arts and sciences and it has impacts on the programme structure, delivery approaches and assessments. At a macro level, governments need to offer a rich diet of cultural activities, outdoor activities and sports fixtures that inform potential creative workers in the areas of video gaming and advertising. This study has implications for work organisations that support and encourage collaborative working alongside individual working, offer opportunities to engage in continuous professional development (formally and informally), and foster an environment, which promotes experiential functioning and supports experimentation.

'''[[Team Composition]]'''

Diversity between team members’ backgrounds and knowledge can increase team creativity by expanding the total collection of unique information that is available to the team and introducing different perspectives that can integrate in novel ways. However, under some conditions, diversity can also decrease team creativity by making it more difficult for team members to communicate about ideas and causing interpersonal conflicts between those with different perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harvey | first1 = S | year = 2013 | title = A different perspective: The multiple effects of deep level diversity on group creativity | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 49 | issue = 5| pages = 822–832 | doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2013.04.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the potential advantages of diversity must be supported by appropriate team processes and organizational cultures in order to enhance creativity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Paletz | first1 = S.

'''Team Processes'''

Team communication [[norm (social)|norm]]s, such as respecting others’ expertise, paying attention to others’ ideas, expecting information sharing, tolerating disagreements, [[negotiation|negotiating]], remaining open to others’ ideas, learning from others, and building on each other’s ideas, increase team creativity by facilitating the social processes involved with [[brainstorming]] and [[problem solving]]. Through these processes, team members are able to access their collective pool of knowledge, reach shared understandings, identify new ways of understanding problems or tasks, and make new connections between ideas. Engaging in these social processes also promotes positive team [[Affect (psychology)|affect]], which facilitates collective creativity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[Organizational culture|'''Organizational Culture''']]

Supportive and motivational environments that create [[psychological safety]] by encouraging risk taking and tolerating mistakes increase team creativity as well.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Organizations in which [[help-seeking]], [[Helping behavior|help giving]], and [[collaboration]] are rewarded promote innovation by providing opportunities and contexts in which team processes that lead to collective creativity can occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hargadon | first1 = A.

==Economic views of creativity==
Economic approaches to creativity have focussed on three aspects — the impact of creativity on economic growth, methods of modelling markets for creativity, and the maximisation of economic creativity (innovation).

In the early 20th century, [[Joseph Schumpeter]] introduced the economic theory of ''[[creative destruction]]'', to describe the way in which old ways of doing things are endogenously destroyed and replaced by the new. Some economists (such as [[Paul Romer]]) view creativity as an important element in the recombination of elements to produce new technologies and products and, consequently, economic growth. Creativity leads to [[capital (economics)|capital]], and creative products are protected by [[intellectual property]] laws.

[[Mark A. Runco]] and Daniel Rubenson have tried to describe a "[[Behavioral economics|psychoeconomic]]" model of creativity.&lt;ref name="RubRunc1992"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0732-118X(92)90021-Q|last=Rubenson|first=Daniel L.|author2=Runco, Mark |authorlink2=Mark A. Runco |title=The psychoeconomic approach to creativity|journal=New Ideas in Psychology|year=1992|volume=10|issue=2|pages=131–147}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such a model, creativity is the product of endowments and active investments in creativity; the costs and benefits of bringing creative activity to market determine the supply of creativity. Such an approach has been criticised for its view of creativity consumption as always having positive [[utility]], and for the way it analyses the value of future innovations.&lt;ref name="Diamond1992"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0732-118X(92)90023-S|last=Diamond|first=Arthur M.|title=Creativity and Interdisciplinarity: A Response to Rubenson and Runco|journal=New Ideas in Psychology|year=1992|volume=10|issue=2|pages=157–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[creative class]]'' is seen by some to be an important driver of modern economies. In his 2002 book, ''The Rise of the Creative Class'', [[economist]] [[Richard Florida]] popularized the notion that regions with "3 T's of economic development: Technology, Talent and Tolerance" also have high concentrations of [[creative professional]]s and tend to have a higher level of economic development.

==Fostering creativity==
{{Main|Creativity techniques}}

Several different researchers have proposed methods of increasing the creativity of an individual. Such ideas range from the [[Psychology|psychological]]-cognitive, such as [[Alex Faickney Osborn|Osborn]]-[[Sid Parnes|Parnes]] [[Creative_problem-solving|Creative Problem Solving Process]], [[Synectics]], science-based creative thinking, Purdue Creative Thinking Program, and [[Edward de Bono]]'s [[lateral thinking]]; to the highly structured, such as [[TRIZ]] (the Theory of Inventive Problem-Solving) and its variant Algorithm of Inventive Problem Solving (developed by the Russian scientist [[Genrich Altshuller]]), and Computer-Aided [[Morphological analysis (problem-solving)|morphological analysis]].

Daniel Pink, in his 2005 book ''A Whole New Mind'', repeating arguments posed throughout the 20th century, argues that we are entering a new age where creativity is becoming increasingly important. In this ''conceptual age'', we will need to foster and encourage ''right-directed thinking'' (representing creativity and emotion) over ''left-directed thinking'' (representing logical, analytical thought). However, this simplification of 'right' versus 'left' brain thinking is not supported by the research data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/lives-the-brain/201004/creativity-the-brain-and-evolution|title=Creativity, the Brain, and Evolution|website=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Building motivation, especially internal motivation
# Encouraging confidence and a willingness to take risks
# Focusing on mastery and self-competition
# Promoting supportable beliefs about creativity
# Providing opportunities for choice and discovery
# Developing self-management (metacognitive skills)
# Teaching techniques and strategies for facilitating creative performance

==Creativity and education policies==

Some see the conventional system of [[education|schooling]] as "stifling" of creativity and attempt (particularly in the [[preschool]]/[[kindergarten]] and early school years) to provide a creativity-friendly, rich, imagination-fostering environment for young children.&lt;ref name=Nickerson99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name="Csik99handbook"&gt;{{cite book|last=Csíkszentmihályi|first=Mihály|title=Handbook of Creativity|year=1999|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|editor=R.

M.|title=Why creativity now?|journal=Educational Leadership|year=2009|volume=67|issue=1|pages=22–26|authorlink=Ken Robinson (British author)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have seen this as important because technology is advancing our society at an unprecedented rate and creative problem solving will be needed to cope with these challenges as they arise.&lt;ref name=RobAzzam2009 /&gt; In addition to helping with problem solving, creativity also helps students identify problems where others have failed to do so.&lt;ref name=Nickerson99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name= Csik99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paris, C., Edwards, N., Sheffield, E., Mutinsky, M., Olexa, T., Reilly, S., &amp; Baer, J. (2006). How early school experiences impact creativity. In J. C. Kaufman &amp; J. Baer (Eds.), Creativity and Reason in Cognitive Development (pp. 333–350). New York, NY: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; See the Waldorf School as an example of an education program that promotes creative thought.

Promoting intrinsic motivation and problem solving are two areas where educators can foster creativity in students. Students are more creative when they see a task as intrinsically motivating, valued for its own sake.&lt;ref name=Csik99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name=RobAzzam2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name="ByrgeHanson2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Byrge|first=C.|author2=Hanson.

(1993). Evolution and flow. In M. Csikszentmihalyi (Ed.), The evolving self: A psychology for the third millennium (pp. 175–206). New York: Harper Perennial.&lt;/ref&gt; To promote creative thinking, educators need to identify what motivates their students and structure teaching around it. Providing students with a choice of activities to complete allows them to become more intrinsically motivated and therefore creative in completing the tasks.&lt;ref name=Nickerson99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Advisory Committee on Creative and Cultural Education (1998). All our futures: Creativity, culture, and education. UK: NACCCE&lt;/ref&gt;

Teaching students to solve problems that do not have well defined answers is another way to foster their creativity. This is accomplished by allowing students to explore problems and redefine them, possibly drawing on knowledge that at first may seem unrelated to the problem in order to solve it.&lt;ref name=Nickerson99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name=Csik99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name= RobAzzam2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ByrgeHanson2009 /&gt; In adults, mentoring individuals is another way to foster their creativiy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The manifesto : a guide to developing a creative career|last=Torrance|first=E.

===Scotland===
In the [[Education in Scotland|Scottish education system]], creativity is identified as a core skillset for learning, life and work and is defined as “a process which generates ideas that have value to the individual.  It involves looking at familiar things with a fresh eye, examining problems with an open mind, making connections, learning from mistakes and using imagination to explore new possibilities.” [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/practice-exemplars/Creativity%203-18%20curriculum%20review%20(impact%20report)] The need to develop a shared language and understanding of creativity and its role across every aspect of learning, teaching and continuous improvement was identified as a necessary aim [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/learning-resources/Creative%20Learning%20Networks] and a set of four skills is used to allow educators to discuss and develop creativity skills across all subjects and sectors of education – curiosity, open—mindedness, imagination and problem solving. [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/learning-resources/What%20are%20creativity%20skills?] Distinctions are made between creative learning (when learners are using their creativity skills), creative teaching (when educators are using their creativity skills) and creative change (when creativity skills are applied to planning and improvement). [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/documents/creativity/cre24_infographics/cre24-the-big-picture.pdf] Scotland’s national Creative Learning Plan [http://www.creativescotland.com/resources/our-publications/plans-and-strategy-documents/scotlands-creative-learning-plan-2013] supports the development of creativity skills in all learners and of educators’ expertise in developing creativity skills. A range of resources have been created to support and assess this [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/Pages/Search.aspx?k=Creativity%20infographics] including a national review of creativity across learning by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate for Education. [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/practice-exemplars/Creativity%203-18%20curriculum%20review%20(impact%20report)]

===United States===
Creativity has also been identified as one of the key [[21st century skills]] and as one of the  [[Four Cs of 21st century learning]] by educational leaders and theorists in the United States.

In its [[Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity]], UNESCO notes the importance of States adopting inclusive ways of encouraging cultural diversity...&lt;ref name="Poole01"&gt;[http://www.ibcperu.org/doc/isis/11953.pdf Peter Poole (2003) Cultural Mapping and Indigenous People: A Report to UNESCO] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726164459/http://www.ibcperu.org/doc/isis/11953.pdf |date=2011-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Cultural mapping is also used to describe the use of research methods, tools, and techniques to identify, describe, portray, promote, and plan future use of particular regions' or cities' combined cultural assets and resources:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A broadly-based mapping exercise for purposes of investigating or creating an identity profile of the community is enriching, informative and useful ... The process of mapping by itself draws attention to the existence and importance of cultural resources. The results point out problems to be solved or strengths to build upon.&lt;ref name="CreativeCity01"&gt;[http://www.2010legaciesnow.com/fileadmin/user_upload/ExploreArts/Toolkits/CultureMapping.pdf  Arts Now (2007) Cultural Mapping Toolkit. Creativecity.ca]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cultural mapping is an emerging interdisciplinary field in which a range of perspectives are used as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
a mode of inquiry and a methodological tool in urban planning, cultural sustainability, and community development that makes visible the ways local stories, practices, relationships, memories, and rituals constitute places as meaningful locations."&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Duxbury, W.F.

The '''culture of [[Qatar]]''' is strongly influenced by traditional [[Arab culture|Bedouin culture]], with less acute influence deriving from [[India]], [[East Africa]] and elsewhere in the [[Persian Gulf]]. The peninsula's harsh climatic conditions compelled its inhabitants to turn to the sea for sustenance. Thus, there is a distinct emphasis placed on the sea in local culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abu Saud|first=Abeer|title=Qatari Women: Past and Present|publisher=Longman Group United Kingdom|date=1984|isbn=978-0582783720|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Literature and folklore themes are often related to sea-based activities. 

Oral arts such as poetry and singing were historically more prevalent than [[figurative art]] because of the restrictions placed by [[Aniconism in Islam|Islam on depictions of sentient beings]]; however, certain visual art disciplines such as calligraphy, architecture and textile arts were widely practiced. Figurative arts were gradually assimilated into the country's culture during the [[History of Qatar#Oil drilling|oil era]].&lt;ref&gt;Abu Saud (1984), p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2016, [[Salah bin Ghanim Al Ali]] has been the [[Ministry of Culture and Sports (Qatar)|Minister for Culture and Sports]] of Qatar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oxgaps.org/files/interview_al_ali.pdf|title=Interview: H.E.

Because of [[Islam]]'s [[Aniconism in Islam|stance on figurative art]], paintings and [[plastic arts]] played a relatively insignificant role in Qatari culture until the discovery of oil in the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Abu Saud (1984), p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; Other visual arts such as [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphy]] and [[Islamic architecture|architecture]] were the most historically dominant forms of Islamic visual expression. Calligraphy was most prized in society because of its close connection with Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Abu Saud (1984), p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; Calligraphy is often used in the design of official state [[logo]]s, for example, the [[Qatar National Vision 2030]] logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culturaldiplomacy.org/academy/content/pdf/participant-papers/2013-08-acd/Aysha_Khalid_Mahmood_-_Expressions_of_Arabic_Calligraphy_in_Arabic_Typography_for_a_Cultural_Identity_of_the_Visual_Arabic_Script.pdf|publisher=Cultural Diplomacy|title=Expressions of Arabic Calligraphy in Arabic Typography for a Cultural Identity of the Visual Arabic Script|author=Aysha Khalid Mahmood|page=8|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Art exhibition]]s were held under the auspices of the Ministry of Education until 1972, whereupon the state began providing its full support to the art scene. The Qatari Fine Arts Society was established in 1980 with the objective of promoting the works of Qatari artists.&lt;ref&gt;Abu Saud (1984), p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yousef Ahmad]] is a leading figure of Qatar's art industry and regularly represents the country at international biennials and events. His art work has been displayed internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McCoy|first=Lisa|title=Qatar (Major Muslim Nations)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UMwdBQAAQBAJ|publisher=Mason Crest|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mathaf Arab Museum of Modern Art at Education City.jpg|thumb|left|Mathaf: Arab Museum of Modern Art interior in 2011]]
For the last twenty years, several members of the [[House of Thani|Al Thani]] family have led Qatar’s interest and involvement into the field of arts and continue to shape the cultural policy of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Robert Kluijver|url=http://gulfartguide.com/essay/the-al-thanis-involvement-in-the-arts/|title=The Al Thani’s involvement in the arts|publisher=Gulf Art Guide|accessdate=15 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518093205/http://gulfartguide.com/essay/the-al-thanis-involvement-in-the-arts/|archivedate=18 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qatar was revealed to be the world's biggest art buyer in 2011 by [[The Art Newspaper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/jul/13/qatar-world-biggest-art-buyer|title=Qatar becomes world's biggest buyer of contemporary art|publisher=The Guardian|date=13 July 2011|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Qatar Museums]] was established in the early 2000s to build and connect all museums and collections in Qatar. Two major museums  lead the institution: the [[Museum of Islamic Art, Doha|Museum of Islamic Art]] opened in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/focus/2008/11/20081122145957210396.html|title=Qatar unveils Islamic arts museum|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=23 November 2008|accessdate=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Mathaf: Arab Museum of Modern Art]], opened in [[Education City]] by [[Qatar Foundation]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N6swDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA165&amp;lpg=PA165|title=Art and the Global Economy|publisher=University of California Press|author=John Zarobell|page=165|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a quartet comprising Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt [[2017–18 Qatar diplomatic crisis|severed all ties]] with and imposed a blockade of Qatar on 5 June 2017, Qatari artist Ahmed Al-Maadheed created an illustration known as "Tamim Almajd", which translates to "Tamim the Glorious". The illustration, a simple black and white sketch of Emir [[Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani]] containing the text "Tamim Almajd" in the style of [[Arabic calligraphy]], has become symbolic of Qatari nationalism. The image is now displayed prominently on buildings, in media and in art in Qatar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/tamim-the-glorious-enthrals-qatar/article19421398.ece|title=‘Tamim the Glorious’ enthrals Qatar|publisher=The Hindu|agency=AFP|date=3 August 2017|accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Folklore==
[[File:DhowFestivalQatar.jpg|thumb|left|A large dhow historically used for pearling at a Qatari dhow festival]]
Local folk stories were seldom documented, instead being passed down orally from generation to generation. After Qatar began profitting from oil exploration, the tradition of passing down these stories gradually ceased. Government ministries such as the [[Ministry of Culture and Sports (Qatar)|Ministry of Culture and Sports]] and local universities have made efforts to preserve and transcribe local legends in publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/Arts/2011/0328/Saving-the-stories|title=Saving the stories|publisher=Christian Science Monitor|author=Amanda Erickson|date=28 March 2011|accessdate=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Qatar's most noted [[folk hero]]es are [[Qatari ibn al-Fuja'a]], a 7th-century [[war poet]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adab.com/modules.php?name=Sh3er&amp;doWhat=ssd&amp;shid=343|title=نبذة حول الشاعر: قطري بن الفجاءة|publisher=Adab|language=Arabic|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Rahmah ibn Jabir Al Jalhami]], an 18th- and 19th-century pirate and transitory leader of Qatar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Allen James Fromherz|author=Allen J. Fromherz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dr8rDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA49|title=Qatar: A Modern History, Updated Edition|publisher=Georgetown University Press|page=49|date=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recurring themes in Qatari folk tales are [[djinn]], pearl diving, and the sea.&lt;ref name="Pechcin"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.academia.edu/34106946/A_Tale_of_The_Lord_of_the_Sea_in_Qatari_Folklore_and_Tradition|title=Fictional Beings in Middle East Cultures|chapter=A Tale of “The Lord of the Sea” in Qatari Folklore and Tradition|publisher=University of Bucharest's Center for Arab Studies|author=Katarzyna Pechcin|year=2017|accessdate=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One [[myth]] that purportedly originates from Qatar is that of ''May and Gilan'', the latter of whom is said to be progenitor of the [[sail]]. According to tradition, in old times, a wealthy man named Ghilan resided in [[Al Khor (city)|Al Khor]]. Besides commanding a crew of sailors and fishermen, he owned numerous [[Pearl hunting|pearling]] boats. As time passed, a woman named May who commanded superior number of boats and crewmen emerged as Ghilan's main adversary.&lt;ref name="mayghilan"/&gt;

[[File:Arab pearl divers in the Persian Gulf.jpg|thumb|Pearl diving in the Persian Gulf]]
In an incident in which both crews were attempting to harvest the same pearl bed, May taunted Ghilan as her ship raced past his. This incensed Ghilan, who set out to discover a way to best his competitor. While observing a grasshopper, Ghilan took note of how its wings worked, and applied the same principle to his boats, giving rise to the sail. This enabled his boats to travel at higher speeds, allowing him to outpace May's boats to the densest pearl beds. The myth is typically presented in five sequences and is unlike most other known [[Bedouin]] stories. According to locals of Al Khor, the myth originated from the [[Al Muhannadi]] tribe of Al Khor. The story is not well-known elsewhere in Qatar.&lt;ref name="mayghilan"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://journals.openedition.org/tc/1161|title=La légende de May et Ghilân, mythe d’origine de la pêche des perles ?|journal=Techniques &amp; Culture|year=2004|author=Anie Montigny|pages=43–44|language=French|accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Lord of the Sea'' tale is famous in Qatar as well as the rest of the Persian Gulf region. The story revolves around a water djinn in the Persian Gulf named Bū Daryā who terrorizes sailors and pearl divers. It remains a well-known tale among Qatar's older population, particularly those who worked in maritime activities.&lt;ref name="Pechcin"/&gt;

==Literature==
{{Main|Qatari literature}}
Qatari literature dates back to the 19th century with poets such as Abdul Jalil Al-Tabatabai and Mohammed bin Abdullah bin Uthaymeen. However, due to widespread illiteracy in the region at this time, local written literature dating back to the 19th century is scarce.&lt;ref name="tawfiq"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aljasra.org/archive/cms/?p=2727|title=الشعر في قطر علي امتداد مائة سنة|publisher=Al Jasra Cultural and Social Club|author=Hassan Tawfiq|language=Arabic|date=1 May 2015|accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The modern literature movement in Qatar began in the 1950s, during the same time as the [[Qatari art|modern arts movement]]. This was largely because the increased prosperity from oil extraction activities allowed Qataris to receive formal education, adopt more settled lifestyles and attend higher education institutes abroad in order to hone their creative skills.&lt;ref name="tawfiq"/&gt; Other factors involved in triggering a literary revolution were the improved social standing of women, the advent of a national identity, and the introductions of literary organisations, journalism and mass immigration.&lt;ref name="oxford1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Waïl S. Hassan (book editor), Mohammed Mostafa Salem (chapter 22)|title=The Oxford Handbook of Arab Novelistic Traditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TXAuDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA384|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=383–393|chapter=22|date=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Unlike most other forms of art in Qatari society, females have been involved in the literature movement on a similar magnititude to males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Rebecca L. Torstrick &amp; Elizabeth Faier|title=Culture and Customs of the Arab Gulf States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jwp6D51NB34C&amp;pg=PA45|publisher=Greenwood|page=49|year=2009|isbn=978-0313336591}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yousef Ni'ma introduced the first two collections of short stories in 1970, entitled ''Bint Al-Khaleej (Daughter of the Gulf)'' and ''Liqa fi Beirut (A Meeting in Bayrut)''.&lt;ref name="oxford1"/&gt; In the 1970s, much of the early work of females revolved around ''ritha'' poems which were published in local newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Abu Saud (1984), p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kaltham Jaber]] became the first Qatari woman to publish a collection of short stories,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/qatar/al-sharq-news/20151014/282716225832524|title=ﻨﻈﻤﻬﺎ إدارة «اﻟﺒﺤﻮث واﻟﺪراﺳﺎت» ﻧﺪوة ﺛﻘﺎﻓﻴﺔ ﺗﻮﺛﻖ ﻟﻠﺴﺮد اﻟﻘﻄﺮي ﻧﻬﺎﻳﺔ أﻛﺘﻮﺑﺮ|publisher=Al Sharq|website=pressreader.com|language=Arabic|date=14 October 2015|accessdate=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first Qatari woman writer to publish a major work when she released her anthology of short stories, dating from 1973 to the year of its publishing, 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Abu Saud (1984), p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; Entitled "''Ania wa Ghabat as-Samt wa at-Taraddud''", the main focus of these stories is the desire for Qatari women to have a role in restructuring social norms and cultural conceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Subayyil|first=ʻAbd al-ʻAzīz|title=The Short Story in the Arabian Peninsula: Realistic Trends|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qjceAQAAMAAJ|publisher=Indiana University|year=1991|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AbdulazizAlMahmoud.jpg|thumb|left|[[Abdulaziz Al-Mahmoud]], Qatari novelist]]
In the late 20th and the 21st centuries, novels became popular among Qatari writers. [[Shu'a' Khalifa]] and her sister [[Dalal Khalifa]] were the first two Qatari novelists to publish their works. They accomplished this feat with the publishing of three separate novels in 1993: ''al-Ubur ila al-haqiqa (Passage to Truth)'', written by Shu'a' in 1987, Ahlam al-bahr al-qadima (The Old Dreams of the Sea), written by Shu'a' in 1990 and ''Usturat al-Insan wa-l-buhayra (The Myth of the Man and the Lake'', written by Dalal. Their novels center around social limitations faced by women, and scrutinize long-held social values. Another important theme in their novels is the rapid societal transition experienced by Qatar since the discovery of oil.&lt;ref name="oxford1"/&gt; 

[[Abdulaziz Al-Mahmoud]] published his maritime novel ''Al Qursan'' in August 2011, and it went on to become one of the best-selling books to be released by a Qatari author.&lt;ref name&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qf.org.qa/content/the-foundation/issue-53/sharing-the-secrets-of-literary-success|title=Sharing The Secrets Of Literary Success|publisher=Qatar Foundation|date=14 May 2013|accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By June 2015, twelve Qatari women and eight Qatari men had published a collective total of thirty-nine novels.&lt;ref name="oxford1"/&gt; Novels have proven to be one of the fastest growing categories of literature, with nearly a quarter of all existing Qatari-authored novels being published as recently as 2014. Six new female Qatari writers published novels in 2014. Similar to their predecessors, the main themes in their books are women's role in society and the social transition of Qatar.&lt;ref name="oxford1"/&gt;

===Poetry===
[[File:Traditional dhow festival in Qatar.jpg|thumb|Traditional dhow festival held at [[Katara Cultural Village]]]]
Poetry has been an integral part of the culture since pre-Islamic times.&lt;ref name="abusaud1"&gt;Abu Saud (1984), p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; [[Qatari ibn al-Fuja'a]], a [[folk hero]] dating to the seventh-century, was renowned for writing poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adab.com/modules.php?name=Sh3er&amp;doWhat=ssd&amp;shid=343|title=نبذة حول الشاعر: قطري بن الفجاءة|publisher=Adab|language=Arabic|accessdate=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was seen as a verbal art which fulfilled essential social functions. Having a renowned poet among its ranks was a source of pride for tribes; it is the primary way in which age-old traditions are passed down generations. Poems composed by females primarily focused on the theme of ''ritha'', to lament. This type of poetry served as an [[elegy]].&lt;ref name="abusaud1"/&gt;

[[Nabati]] was the primary form of oral poetry. In the nineteenth-century, sheikh [[Jassim bin Mohammed Al Thani|Jassim Al Thani]] composed influential Nabati poems on the political conditions in Qatar.&lt;ref&gt;Abu Saud (1984), p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; Nabati poems are broadcast on radio and televised in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Abu Saud (1984), p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
{{Main|Music of Qatar}}
[[File:TraditionalQatariDancers.jpg|thumb|240px|Traditional Qatari male dancers]]

The [[folk music]] of Qatar has a close association with the sea. Songs related to [[pearl hunting]] are the most popular genre of male folk music. Each song, varying in rhythm, narrates a different activity of the pearling trip, including spreading the sails, diving, and rowing the ships. Collective singing was an integral part of each pearling trip, and each ship had a designated singer, known locally as ''al naham''.&lt;ref name="abusaud146"&gt;Abu Saud (1984), p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ardah]], a folkloric dance, is still practiced in Qatar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qatarembassy.info/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=61:arts-and-culture&amp;catid=12:tourism-culture-and-leisure&amp;Itemid=4|title=Arts and Culture|publisher=Embassy of Qatar in London|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dance is performed with two rows of men opposite of one another, each of whom may or may not be wielding a sword, and is accompanied by drums and spoken poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Urkevich|first=Lisa|title=Music and Traditions of the Arabian Peninsula: Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Qatar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gy-cBQAAQBAJ|format=Google Play|pages=142–143/689|chapter=5|publisher=Routledge|date=19 December 2014|isbn=978-0415888721}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, women primarily sang work songs associated with daily activities such as wheat grinding and cooking. The songs were performed collectively in small groups some pertained to general themes, whereas others were related to specific work processes.&lt;ref name="abusaud2"/&gt; Women would also sing when returning pearl ships were sighted.&lt;ref name="abusaud146"/&gt; After a sighting was made, they would gather around the seashore where they would clap and sing about the hardships of pearl diving.&lt;ref name="abusaud2"&gt;Abu Saud (1984), p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sport==
[[File:AlGharafa AlRayyan Emir Cup.jpg|thumb|left|National anthem being performed prior to an [[Emir of Qatar Cup|Emir Cup final]].]]
{{Main|Sport in Qatar}}
[[Association football|Football]] is the most popular sport in regard to player base and spectatorship. Additionally, [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]], [[basketball]], [[team handball|handball]], [[volleyball]], [[camel racing]], [[horse racing]], [[cricket]] and [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]] are widely practiced.&lt;ref name="qsa1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qsa.gov.qa/eng/publication/annabs/2013/Sport%20chapter.xlsx|title=Sports chapter (2013)|publisher=Qatar Statistics Authority|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently 11 multi-sports clubs in the country, and 7 single-sports clubs.&lt;ref name="qsa1"/&gt;

Prior to the introduction of football, traditional games played were ''al dahroi'', ''al sabbah'', and ''taq taq taqiyyah'' for boys, and ''al kunatb'', ''al laqfah'' and ''nat al habl'' for girls.&lt;ref name="catnaps"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catnaps.org/islamic/society2.html|title=Society 2 of 6|publisher=Catnaps|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Variations of a family of board games known as [[mancala]] were played in previous decades. Two of the most popular board games were ''a’ailah'' and ''al haluwsah''.&lt;ref name="catnaps"/&gt; Other traditional sports practiced in the country include [[falconry]], camel racing and hunting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qatartourism.gov.qa/en/traditional-sports.html|title=Traditional sports|publisher=Qatar Tourism Authority|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Board game damah at Souq Waqif.jpg|thumb|Two men playing the traditional board game of ''damah'' in [[Souq Waqif]]]]
Historically camel racing was a tradition among the [[Bedouin]] tribes of Qatar and would be performed on special occasions such as weddings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0022/002240/224033e.pdf |title=The Camel From Tradition to Modern Times |first1=Marc |last1=Breulmann |first2=Benno |last2=Böer |first3=Ulrich |last3=Wernery |first4=Renate |last4=Wernery |first5=Hassan |last5=El Shaer |first6=Ghaleb |last6=Alhadrami |first7=David |last7=Gallacher |first8=John |last8=Peacock |first9=Shaukat Ali |last9=Chaudhary |first10=Gary |last10=Brown |first11=John |last11=Norton |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=23 August 2018|lastauthoramp=yes}}{{rp|25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 1972, one year after Qatar's independence, that camel racing was practiced on a professional level. Typically, camel racing season takes place from September to March. Approximately 22,000 racing camels are used in competitions which are mainly held at the country's primary camel racing venue, the Al-Shahaniya Camel Racetrack. The average distance of such races is usually 4 to 8 km depending on the conditions of the camels being raced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thenational.ae/world/qatar-s-prized-racing-camels-bred-for-success-1.634580|title=Qatar's prized racing camels bred for success|publisher=Agence France-Presse|website=thenational.ae|author=David Harding|date=1 May 2017|accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Falconry is widely practiced by Qataris. The only falconry association is Al Gannas, which was founded in 2008 in [[Katara (cultural village)|Katara]] and which hosts the Annual Falconry Festival. Hunting season extends from October to April. Prices of falcons can be extremely high, being as expensive as QR 1 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marhaba.qa/falconry-a-national-sport/|title=Falconry: A National Sport|publisher=Marhaba|date=20 September 2017|accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saluki]] dogs are also used for hunting in the desert primarily because of their great speeds. Their main prey in the desert are [[gazelle]]s and rabbits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/inpictures/2012/01/201212911847243824.html|title=In Pictures: Qatar's hunting games|publisher=Al Jazeera|author=Matthew Cassel|date=29 January 2012|accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Qatar follows Shariah Law, alcohol and pork products cannot be brought into the country. Qatari cuisine reflects traditional [[Arab cuisine|Arab]] and [[Levantine cuisine]].&lt;ref name="dailymeal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailymeal.com/3-m-s-qatari-cuisine|title=The 3 M’s of Qatari Cuisine|publisher=The Daily Meal|date=3 October 2012|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also heavily influenced by [[Iranian cuisine|Iranian]] and [[Indian cuisine]]. [[Seafood]] and [[Date (fruit)|dates]] are staple food items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hilalplaza.com/islamic-culture/Qatar/Qatar_Muslim_culture.html|title=Culture of Qatar|publisher=Hilal Plaza|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kabsa|Machbūs]], a meal consisting of [[rice]], [[meat]], and [[vegetable]]s, is the national dish.&lt;ref name="dailymeal"/&gt;

[[Alcohol]] is not illegal in Qatar, but its sale and consumption is heavily regulated. Muslims are prohibited from purchasing and consuming alcohol. A liquor license is required to buy alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifeinqatar.com/en/article/living/culture-and-etiquette-in-qatar.html|title=Culture and Etiquette in Qatar|publisher=Life in Qatar|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dress==
[[File:Mannequins in traditional Qatari women's attire.jpg|thumb|Mannequins in traditional Qatari women's attire at [[Sheikh Faisal Bin Qassim Al Thani Museum]]]]
Qatari men wear [[thawb]]s (a long white shirt) over loose pants. They also wear a loose headdress, a [[Keffiyeh|ghutra]], which comes in white or red and white.&lt;ref name="weill"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://qatar-weill.cornell.edu/aboutUs/qa/qCulture.html|title=Qatar culture|publisher=Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the ghutra is a black rope called an agal which holds it in place.&lt;ref name=Hilal/&gt;

Qatari women generally wear customary dresses that include “long black robes” and black head cover "hijab", locally called ''bo'shiya''.&lt;ref&gt;Abu Saud (1984), p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=79539&amp;page=1#.UbToAflOQto|title=For Qatari Women, Change Slow in Coming|publisher=ABC News|author=Courtney King|date=11 April 2003|accessdate=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the more traditional Sunni Muslim clothing for women are the black colored body covering known as the [[abayah]] together with the black scarf used for covering their heads known as the [[Shaylah (clothing)|shayla]].&lt;ref name=Hilal&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hilalplaza.com/islamic-culture/Qatar/Qatar_Muslim_culture.html|title=The Culture of Qatar|publisher=HilalPlaza|accessdate=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[burqa]] is sometimes worn to conceal their face.&lt;ref name="weill"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://qatar-weill.cornell.edu/aboutUs/qa/qCulture.html|title=Qatar culture|publisher=Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed that Qatari women began using face masks in the 19th century amid substantial immigration. As they had no practical ways of concealing their faces from foreigners, they began wearing the same type of face mask as their Persian counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;Abu Saud (1984), p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Zoo Park Dairy.jpg|thumb|300px|A dairy in [[Newtown, New Zealand]]]]

A '''dairy''' is a small owner-operated [[convenience store]] in [[New Zealand]], licensed to sell [[groceries]], milk, eggs, dairy products, perishables, newspapers and other staples during and after normal trading hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=New Zealand
|last=Rawlings-Way
|first=Charles
|page=63
|isbn=1742203647
|location=[[London]]
|publisher= [[Lonely Planet]]
|year=2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and usage==
The term ''dairy'' came into common usage in [[New Zealand English]] to describe small shops by the late 1930s. Perishables such as milk and eggs were formerly delivered to city households from a [[dairy farm]]; by the late 1930s, small shops stocked such produce, and the term shifted to describe these shops. In addition to this meaning, New Zealand English retains the common meanings of ''dairy'', referring to milk, milk-derived products and associated industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|location=[[Auckland]]
|year=2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="te ara" /&gt;

The distinction between dairies, [[superette]]s and [[grocery store]]s has grown increasingly blurred in New Zealand English, a fact acknowledged by the Liquor Licensing Authority in 1991, and by the [[New Zealand Law Commission|Law Commission]]. Contributing factors to this blurring of meanings include the [[Sunday shopping#New Zealand|deregulation of trading shop hours on Sundays]], ambiguity over alcohol sales laws (see [[#Sales of alcohol and legal highs|Sales of alcohol]] below), and the abolition of restrictions on types of goods permitted to be sold by dairies.&lt;ref name="NZLC"&gt;{{cite book
|title= Alcohol In Our Lives: Curbing the Harm

|accessdate=8 January 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Law Commission summed up the ambiguity as follows:

{{quote|text=Traditionally, a dairy was a small shop in a suburban area that sold goods such as butter, milk, bread and confectionery. It was able to trade outside normal trading hours. Today, the term "dairy" has different meanings for different people, and there seem to be fewer dairies in the traditional sense still in operation, although many shops still have "dairy" in their trading name.
|sign=Law Commission
|source=Alcohol In Our Lives: Curbing the Harm&lt;ref name="NZLC"/&gt;}}

==Business and culture==

Dairies rely on long hours rather than high mark-ups to make money, and are not overly profitable. As small operators, they cannot get bulk discounts that [[supermarket]]s get. As dairies must remain open long hours to stay profitable, they are almost always family-run businesses that utilise family members to run the shop.&lt;ref name="te ara"&gt;{{cite web

|work=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]
|publisher=[[Ministry for Culture and Heritage]]
|date=13 July 2012
|accessdate=8 January 2014
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
New Zealand introduced the 40-hour working week in 1945, ending Saturday trading hours for most grocers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=Food shops – Shopping hours
|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/food-shops/page-7
|last=Walrond

|work=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]
|publisher=[[Ministry for Culture and Heritage]]
|date=13 July 2012
|accessdate=8 January 2014
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dairies were allowed to stay open outside normal working hours and on Saturdays.&lt;ref name="te ara" /&gt;

During the 1990s and 2000s, dairies became less profitable as other stores made inroads into their niche as nearby stores open outside regular trading hours. As supermarkets opened for longer hours with the introduction of deregulated shopping hours in 1990, and petrol stations extended the range of goods they sold, dairies began to lose their competitive advantage.&lt;ref name="te ara" /&gt;

===Immigrant ownership===

A 1994 study found that 227 of the 269 dairies in central [[Auckland]] were owned by [[Indian New Zealander|Indian]]s.&lt;ref name="te ara" /&gt; Dairies are often self-owned by [[immigrant]]s, who may face difficulties entering the workforce. Some dairy owners intended to give their children white collar or professional occupations, while other dairies had inter-generational ownership, with children taking over the store when they reach adulthood.&lt;ref name="te ara" /&gt;

The role of dairies in New Zealand's immigrant Indian culture was explored in [[Jacob Rajan]]'s 1997 play ''Krishnan's Dairy'', which toured internationally to positive reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sales of alcohol and legal highs===

The Sale of Liquor Act (1989) prohibited the sale of liquor in "any shop of a kind commonly known as a dairy",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act
| title = Sale of Liquor Act 1989
| number = 63
| language = English

| accessdate = 8 January 2014
}}&lt;/ref&gt; without explicitly defining what a dairy was. In the wake of the act, dairies began altering their stock in order to qualify for a liquor license. This resulted in "a proliferation of small stores distinguishable from dairies only because they are licensed to sell alcohol."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation contributed to the blurring distinction between dairies and grocery stores in New Zealand English.&lt;ref name="NZLC" /&gt;

The Sale and Supply of Alcohol Act 2012 sought to close this unintended loophole, clarifying the types of stores eligible to sell alcohol and ensuring dairies and convenience stores cannot sell alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''''Dark Souls'''''{{efn|{{Nihongo|ダークソウル|Dāku Sōru|lead=yes}}}} is an [[action role-playing game]] developed by [[FromSoftware]] and published by [[Namco Bandai Games]]. A [[spiritual successor]] to FromSoftware's ''[[Demon's Souls]]'', the game is the second installment in the ''[[Souls (series)|Souls]]'' series. It was released for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] in Japan by FromSoftware in September 2011 and worldwide by Namco Bandai Games in the following month. ''Dark Souls'' takes place in the fictional kingdom of Lordran, where players assume the role of a cursed undead character who begins a [[pilgrimage]] to discover the fate of their kind.

''Dark Souls'' received critical acclaim upon its release and is considered to be one of the [[best video games ever released]], with critics praising the depth of its combat, intricate level design, and world lore. However, the game's difficulty received mixed reviews. While some praised the challenge it provides, others criticized it for being unnecessarily unforgiving. The Windows version of the game was less well received, with criticism directed at numerous technical issues.

In August 2012, a version of ''Dark Souls'' for [[Microsoft Windows]], ''[[#PC version|Dark Souls: Prepare To Die Edition]]'', was released. It featured additional content not seen in the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions. In October 2012, the additional content was released as [[downloadable content]] for consoles under the subtitle ''[[Dark Souls: Artorias of the Abyss|Artorias of the Abyss]]''. By April 2013, the game had sold over two million copies worldwide.  A sequel to the game, ''[[Dark Souls II]]'', was released in 2014. A remastered version of the game, ''[[#Dark Souls: Remastered|Dark Souls: Remastered]]'', was released for [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], Windows, and [[Nintendo Switch]] in 2018.

''Dark Souls'' is a third-person [[action role-playing game]]. The core mechanic of the game is exploration. Players are encouraged by the game to proceed with caution, learn from past mistakes, or find alternative areas to explore. ''Dark Souls'' takes place in a large and continuous [[open world]] environment, connected through a central hub area (Firelink Shrine). Players are able to travel to and from areas and explore various paths at will, although certain prerequisites have to be met in order to unlock certain areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2011/10/03/dark-souls-review-brick-walls-and-pancakes/ |title=Dark Souls review: Brick walls and pancakes |work=Engadget |date=October 3, 2011 |accessdate=September 10, 2016 |first=Richard |last=Mitchell}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://m.ign.com/articles/2011/09/30/dark-souls-review |title=Dark Souls Review |work=IGN |date=September 30, 2011 |accessdate=September 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/dark_souls/b/ps3/archive/2011/10/03/dark-souls-review-dead-and-loving-it.aspx |title=Dark Souls Review: Dead And Loving It |work=GameInformer.com |date=October 3, 2011 |accessdate=September 10, 2016 |first=Phil |last=Kollar}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://m.gamerevolution.com/review/dark-souls |title=Dark Souls Review |work=Game Revolution |date=October 3, 2011 |accessdate=September 10, 2016 |first=Daniel |last=Bischoff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The central element to ''Dark Souls'' are [[Bonfire (Dark Souls)|Bonfires]]. Bonfires are scattered throughout the world and serve as checkpoints for each level.  When rested at, the player is healed to full, healing charges are restored, but all of the enemies (except for bosses, mini-bosses, and specific characters) respawn. While resting, players can level up and perform other key functions.

Another aspect of ''Dark Souls'' is the "humanity" system. There are two "forms" the player character can be in during the game, human form and hollow form.  Whenever the player dies in human form, they are returned to hollow form and can only have their humanity restored by consuming an item (also called a "humanity").  In order to gain the assistance of other players, the player must be in human form.  While in human form, the player is subjected to invasions by other players and [[non-player character]]s (NPC) who seek to kill the player and restore their own humanity. Humanity can be acquired in many ways, and if no humanity is available, players are still able to progress in hollow form. Death in either form results in the loss of all carried souls and humanity, but players revive as hollows at their most recent bonfire with one chance at returning to where they died to recover all lost souls and humanity. If the player dies before reaching their "bloodstain", the souls and humanity they previously accrued are permanently lost.

Communication between players is deliberately restricted. Outside of character gestures, the only other communication players have with one another comes by way of orange [[soapstone]]s, which allow players to write limited messages that can be read by others in the same area. In addition, players can enter [[co-cooperative]] or [[player versus player]] combat with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/how-dark-souls-pvp-keeping-game-alive/|title=The rituals, strategies, honour and etiquette that keep Dark Souls PvP alive|last=Ahmed|first=Sayem|date=August 26, 2015|work=Future Publishing Limited Quay House|access-date=August 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/dark-souls/news/master-online-play-vaativiyda|title=Master Online play|last=Entertainment|first=Bandai|date=June 25, 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the game, there are multiple NPCs that the player may encounter on their journey. These characters add to the plot of the game but are not mandatory to engage with. If the player does choose to engage with them, the characters are able to assist the player by being able to be summoned for certain boss fights.

== Plot ==
Dark Souls has a minimalist plot. Historical events in this world and their significance are often implicit and left to player interpretation rather than fully shown or explained. Most of the story is given to the player through dialogue from characters within the game, flavor text from items, and world design. The opening cutscene establishes the premise of the game. The world was once ruled by dragons. In this time period, a man known as Gwyn happens upon an object known as the "First Flame" and finds the "Lord Souls". He and his allies use their power to defeat the dragons, which starts the Age of Fire. Over time, the flames begin to fade with the rise of humans, and Gwyn sacrifices himself to prolong the Age of Fire. With the flame artificially rekindled, the undead curse begins to plague humanity, causing certain humans to continually resurrect upon death.

The game's protagonist is known as the chosen undead. After going through Sens Fortress, the chosen undead defeats the Iron Golem, and soon enters taken into Anor Londo. The Chosen Undead defeats Dragonslayer Ornstein and Executioner Smough and then enters a throne room of Gwynevere, who gives the chosen undead an object known as the "Lordvessel". Optionally, the player may encounter Darkstalker Kaathe who encourages the player not to link the fire but to let it die out and usher in the Age of Dark instead. Once the player acquires the Lord Souls, they travel to the Kiln of the First Flame to battle Gwyn. Once Gwyn has been defeated, the player is given the choice of linking the flame to preserve the Age of Fire, or letting it die out to instigate the Age of Dark.

=== ''Artorias of the Abyss'' ===
{{Main|Dark Souls: Artorias of the Abyss}}
At some point in the past, a being known as Manus awoke and began to spread the Abyss. Knight Artorias was sent to stop the spread of the Abyss, but he failed and became corrupted. Meanwhile, Manus searches desperately for his long-lost pendant across space and time. Once the player obtains the pendant, Manus pulls them into the past. There, the player destroys the corrupted Artorias and defeats Manus, halting the spread of the Abyss.

''Dark Souls'' was developed by [[FromSoftware]], with series creator [[Hidetaka Miyazaki]] directing and producing. Following the game's release for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, many gamers expressed their hope for a PC version. International publisher [[Namco Bandai Games]] administrator Tony Shoupinou responded on their page that a PC version was possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Conditt |first=Jessica |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2012/01/08/dark-souls-admin-suggests-pc-could-happen-with-a-petition/ |title=Dark Souls admin suggests PC could happen with a petition |publisher=Joystiq |date=January 8, 2012 |accessdate=December 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2012, fans started a petition to bring ''Dark Souls'' to PC, with over 93,000 people signing it.&lt;ref name="pc_petition"&gt;{{cite web |title=Petition: Dark Souls for PC |url=http://petitionbureau.org/DarkSoulsForPC/ |date=January 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A PC version of the game was confirmed in April 2012 via German magazine ''PC Action''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Donaldson |first=Alex |url=http://www.rpgsite.net/news/1512-dark-souls-pc-confirmed-in-pc-action-magazine |title=Dark Souls PC confirmed in PC Action magazine |website=rpgsite.net |date=April 7, 2012 |accessdate=October 26, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161026202607/http://www.rpgsite.net/news/1512-dark-souls-pc-confirmed-in-pc-action-magazine |archive-date=October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had been reported during the development process that FromSoftware had been having difficulty with the port due to inexperience with PC as a platform and were focusing on new content rather than optimization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-06-07-from-software-having-a-tough-time-porting-dark-souls-to-pc-frame-rate-issues-remain |title=From Software "having a tough time" porting Dark Souls to PC, frame rate issues remain |first=Fred |last=Dutton |publisher=[[Eurogamer]] |date=June 7, 2012 |accessdate=October 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Re-branded as the ''Prepare To Die Edition'', it came out in August 2012 and featured new content, including bosses, enemies, equipment, and NPCs.&lt;ref name="gamingbolt"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gamingbolt.com/dark-souls-prepare-to-die-edition-coming-to-pc-in-august |title=Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition coming to PC in August « GamingBolt.com: Video Game News, Reviews, Previews and Blog |publisher=Gamingbolt.com |date= |accessdate=December 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new content, titled "''Artorias of the Abyss''", was released for consoles in October 2012 in the form of DLC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vg247.com/2012/05/31/dark-souls-pc-coming-to-steam-consoles-to-get-pc-content/ |title=Dark Souls PC coming to Steam, consoles to get PC content |last=Cullen |first=Johnny |date=May 31, 2012 |publisher=VG247 |accessdate=May 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, it was announced that ''Dark Souls'' for PC would use [[Games for Windows – Live]] for online play and DRM, spurring fan backlash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Makuch |first=Eddie |title=Gamers rallying against Dark Souls PC using Games for Windows Live |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/news/gamers-rallying-against-dark-souls-pc-using-games-for-windows-live-6371507 |publisher=CBS Interactive |accessdate=April 16, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420174732/http://uk.gamespot.com/news/gamers-rallying-against-dark-souls-pc-using-games-for-windows-live-6371507 |archivedate=April 20, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dark Souls'' received positive reviews from critics upon its release. One of the reviewers for ''Dark Souls'' described it as "a very hardcore dark-fantasy [role-playing game]" that is "role-playing right down to the roots", and stated that the "massive field map and powerful enemies serve to rev up both your sense of adventure and your sense of dread". Another reviewer stated that "the sheer happiness you get after the trial-and-error pays off and you overcome the challenge is absolutely impossible to replicate."&lt;ref name="1up_gifford"&gt;{{cite web |last=Gifford |first=Kevin |title=Japan Review Check: Dark Souls |url=http://www.1up.com/news/japan-review-check-dark-souls |publisher=[[1UP.com]] |accessdate=September 23, 2011 |date=September 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[GameSpot]] scored ''Dark Souls'' a 9.5/10. Much praise was given to the online system, as well as the sense of jubilation felt when conquering boss fights after numerous failed attempts. They also suggested that casual gamers may struggle to progress, whereas role-playing game enthusiasts will thrive on the difficulty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dark-souls-review/1900-6337621/ |title=Dark Souls Review |last=VanOrd |first=Kevin |date=October 3, 2011 |website=|access-date=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[IGN]] gave ''Dark Souls'' a 9.0/10, praising the well-thought-out level design, variety, strong emphasis on online features, excessively dark tone and atmosphere, and deep gameplay. While praising the extremely high difficulty, they stated that "there's a difference between punishing, and downright unfair."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Keza MacDonald |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2011/09/30/dark-souls-review?page=1 |title=Dark Souls Review |publisher=IGN |date=September 30, 2011 |accessdate=June 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eurogamer]] gave ''Dark Souls'' 9/10, praising the level design and atmosphere while noting that the game's difficulty might not appeal to casual gamers.&lt;ref name="eurog_dark"&gt;{{cite web |last=Welsh |first=Oli |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-10-03-dark-souls-review |title=Dark Souls Review • Page 1 • Reviews • |publisher=Eurogamer.net |date=October 3, 2011 |accessdate=January 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese publication Famitsu gave it a 37 out of 40 score.&lt;ref name="famitsu1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.famitsu.com/cominy/?m=pc&amp;a=page_h_title&amp;title_id=16392|title=ダークソウル [PS3] / ファミ通.com|website=www.famitsu.com|access-date=July 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', Michael Thomsen asked if a 100-hour video game was ever worthwhile, stating:

{{Quote|There is real beauty in ''Dark Souls''. It reveals that life is more suffering than pleasure, more failure than success, and that even the momentary relief of achievement is wiped away by new levels of difficulty. It is also a testament to our persistence in the face of that suffering, and it offers the comfort of a community of other players all stuck in the same hellish quagmire. Those are good qualities. That is art. And you can get all of that from the first five hours of Dark Souls. The remaining 90 or so offer nothing but an increasingly nonsensical variation on that experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Thomsen |first=Michael |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/gaming/2012/02/dark_souls_review_is_a_100_hour_video_game_ever_worthwhile_.html |title=Dark Souls review: Is a 100-hour video game ever worthwhile? – Slate Magazine |publisher=Slate.com |date= |accessdate=December 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Jason Killingsworth wrote a response to Thomsen's review for ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'', arguing that the game's "vertigo-inducing breadth makes it the gaming equivalent of a marathon".&lt;ref name="Killingsworth, Jason"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edge-online.com/opinion/opinion-long-live-long-rpg |title=Opinion: Long live the long RPG |author=Killingsworth, Jason |work=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] |publisher=[[Future plc|Future Publishing]] |location=[[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] |date=March 2, 2012 |accessdate=December 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Killingsworth praised the game's length and addictive nature.&lt;ref name="Killingsworth, Jason"/&gt;

''Edge'' later retroactively awarded the game 10 out of 10 in their October 2013 20th anniversary issue, stating that over time the breadth and quality of the game's design had overruled complaints about its difficulty.&lt;ref name="edgeten"&gt;{{cite web |title=The ten amendments: we crown seven games from the last 20 years of Edge with a retrospective 10 |url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/the-ten-amendments-we-crown-seven-games-from-the-last-20-years-of-edge-with-a-retrospective-10/ |work=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] |publisher=[[Future plc|Future Publishing]] |location=[[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] |accessdate=February 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of the game, [[Ben "Yahtzee" Croshaw]] praised ''Dark Souls'' in his [[Zero Punctuation]] video for its deep gameplay and immersive atmosphere, but was "disappointed" with the late-game bosses and criticized the difficulty of getting into the game, stating that the difficulty would be a key factor in turning less new players off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/8802-Dark-Souls |title=Dark Souls - Zero Punctuation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[GameSpy]]'s review, the port was referred to as "shabby", citing the game's limit of 30 frames per second, poor mouse and keyboard controls, and nonadjustable resolution, but the expanded content was praised, giving the game an overall favorable review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Janicki |first=Stefan |title=Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition Review |url=http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/dark-souls/1225854p1.html |publisher=[[GameSpy]] |accessdate=October 11, 2012 |date=September 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eurogamer]] also commented on the quality of the port, stating: "''Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition'' does not come with the technical options you would expect from a well-engineered PC game, because it's a port of a console game, and that's all FromSoftware ever promised to deliver. Anyone who passes up Dark Souls for this reason is cutting off their nose to spite their [[neckbeard (slang)|neckbeard]] of a face."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Stanton |first=Rich |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-08-28-dark-souls-prepare-to-die-edition-review |title=Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition Review • Reviews • PC • |publisher=Eurogamer.net |date=August 28, 2012 |accessdate=December 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the producers of ''Dark Souls II'', Takeshi Miyazoe, responded to the criticism of the PC version by saying:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/dark-souls-producer-says-pc-version-was-rushed-problems-were-expected/ |title=Dark Souls’ producer says PC version was rushed, problems "were expected" |date=December 19, 2013 |work=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] |publisher=[[Future plc]] |accessdate=March 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This is going to sound bad but our main priority was to get the game onto the PC as fast as possible, because people wanted it on the PC. The PC market in Japan is so minimal that originally there were no plans to make it on the PC, but with the strong petition from the North American and European fans, even with the lack of experience of working on a PC platform we still did our best to try to get it out as fast as possible. [The problems] were expected to a certain extent.

We did know there were PC-specific features like key-mapping and use of the mouse and keyboard, high resolution and higher frame rate, stuff like that, but... It's not that we ignored it, but it would have taken too much time for us to implement it, test it and get it up to the level people expected. It was more of a publisher (Namco Bandai) decision to say, ‘Guys, don’t worry about this – let’s just get it out and see how this works on PC.'

{{nihongo|'''''Digimon Frontier'''''|デジモンフロンティア|Dejimon Furontia|lead=yes}}, known as '''''Digimon: Digital Monsters (Season 4)''''' in English-speaking territories, is the fourth [[anime]] television series of the ''[[Digimon]]'' franchise, produced by [[Toei Animation]]. Unlike the first three series, the main characters, the DigiDestined merge with ancient spirits known as "Legendary Warriors" to become Digimon themselves, instead of training. Like ''[[Digimon Tamers]]'', the climax features any human fusing each partner as a Mega form. The series aired in Japan from April 7, 2002 to March 30, 2003, with an English-language version, produced by [[Saban Entertainment#Sensation Animation|Sensation Animation]], airing in North America from September 9, 2002 to July 14, 2003.

In the events prior to the series, a group of ten Digimon creatures from the "Digital World", a parallel universe originated from Earth's various communication networks, sacrificed themselves to defeat an ultimate evil for invading their world. These Digimon collectively known as "Legendary Warriors" created artifacts from their data, the twenty "Spirits" (ten Human Spirits and Beast Spirits for each elements), before leaving the Digital World in the care of three Celestial Digimon, Ophanimon, Cherubimon and Seraphimon. However, Cherubimon betrays them. To counter this, Ophanimon summons five children.

{{Main article|List of Digimon Frontier episodes}}
The five DigiDestined find their respective Human Spirits and merge with them to "Spirit Evolve" into Digimon themselves. While finding each of their Beast Spirits, they meet five other Legendary Warriors, who serve Cherubimon. After defeating them (the rest of them destroy one and Koji takes another Beast Spirit), Koji notices that Cherubimon and Koichi are opposing them. Takuya and his friends free Koichi, restores his power, and allows him to join them. They rescue Ophanimon. However, she sacrifices herself to save them. Ophanimon upgrades Takuya and Koji's D-Tectors, with the last of her strength to allow them to Unity Spirit Evolve. After defeating Cherubimon, the DigiDestined learn that Lucemon is sealed within the Digital World's core. Two Royal Knights, Dynasmon and Crusadermon, scan all of the world's data to awaken Lucemon. Takuya and Koji defeat the knights, just as they scan the Digital World. When Lucemon frees himself, he opens a portal to the real world. After Koichi sacrifices his power, Lucemon leaves the Digital World. While all spirits combine to form into the ultimate Legendary Warrior Digimon Susanoomon, Lucemon arrives at the real world. After reviving Ophanimon, Cherubimon and Seraphimon, Susanoomon destroys Lucemon, recovering the data and restoring the Digital World. The children return to the real world and realize that an hour did not pass. They save Koichi by using the power of D-Tectors, before it reverts into cell phones. Takuya and his friends embrace their future.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4103">'''Emergent Design''' is a [[phrase]] coined by [[David Cavallo]] to describe a theoretical [[Conceptual framework|framework]] for the implementation of systemic change in education and learning environments.  This examines how choice of design [[methodology]] contributes to the success or failure of [[education reforms]] through studies in [[Thailand]]. It is related to the theories of [[situated learning]] and of [[constructionist learning]]. The term constructionism was coined by [[Seymour Papert]] under whom Cavallo studied. Emergent Design holds that education systems cannot adapt effectively to technology change unless the education is rooted in the existing skills and needs of the local culture.

== Applications ==
The most notable non-theoretical application of the principles of emergent design is in the [[OLPC XO|OLPC]], whose concept work is supported in Cavallo's paper "Models of growth &amp;mdash; towards fundamental change in learning environment".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.media.mit.edu/publications/bttj/Paper11Pages96-112.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emergent design in agile software development ==
Emergent design is a consistent topic in [[agile software development]], as a result of the methodology's focus on delivering small pieces of working code with business value. With emergent design, a development organization starts delivering functionality and lets the design emerge. Development will take a piece of functionality A and implement it using best practices and proper test coverage and then move on to delivering functionality B. Once B is built, or while it is being built, the organization will look at what A and B have in common and refactor out the commonality, allowing the design to emerge. This process continues as the organization continually delivers functionality. At the end of an agile release cycle, development is left with the smallest set of the design needed, as opposed to the design that could have been anticipated in advance. The end result is a simpler design with a smaller code base, which is more easily understood and maintained and naturally has less room for defects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agilesherpa.org/agile_coach/engineering_practices/emergent_design Emergent design discussion at agileSherpa]&lt;/ref&gt;. Practices like Change Vector Tracking has helped teams adopting Emergent design as their design philosophy more systematic, disciplined and pragmatic.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite paper

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emergent Design for social change ==
Emergent Design is also being used in social change movements, such as a group of Canadian NGOs that are bringing together a group of civic leaders to discuss how their work scales up and scales deep. A series of events are being organized by the Carold Institute and [[Ashoka: Innovators for the Public|Ashoka Canada]] in 2013 through to 2015. The project goals currently include, but are not limited to:
* Engage emerging leaders in redefining models and systems that will support a vibrant and dynamic civil society in Canada.
* Strengthen and broaden the impact of their leadership
* Discover and disseminate new knowledge related to systems change and emerging systems
* Share key learning, insights, innovative strategies and new models of engagement among participants and with key stakeholders and sponsoring organizations

'''''Exodus''''' is a 2007 [[Military science fiction|military science fiction novel]], and sequel to the "Stars at War" series, written by [[Steve White (science fiction)|Steve White]] and [[Shirley Meier]].

==Plot summary==
Advanced aliens depart their homeworld in order to flee their stars impending [[nova]].

Decades after the Terran Civil War the aliens arrive and attempt to colonize an inhabited human world. They are not able to recognize the intelligence of the planet's inhabitants, because they do not recognize human forms of communication as communication.

The miscommunication leads to warfare, where these new aliens throw themselves at their opponents with suicidal fury. The old "anti Bug" alliance partners join together to fight off this new threat.

The '''Feynman Prize in Nanotechnology''' is an award given by the [[Foresight Institute]] for significant advances in [[nanotechnology]].  Two prizes are awarded annually, in the categories of experimental and theoretical work. There is also a separate [[Inducement prize contest|challenge award]] for making a nanoscale robotic arm and 8-bit [[Adder (electronics)|adder]].

== Overview ==
The Feynman Prize consists of annual prizes in experimental and theory categories, as well as a one-time [[Inducement prize contest|challenge award]].  They are awarded by the [[Foresight Institute]], a nanotechnology education organization.  The prizes are named in honor of physicist [[Richard Feynman]], whose 1959 talk ''[[There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom]]'' is considered to have inspired and informed the start of the field of nanotechnology.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The annual Feynman Prize in Nanotechnology is awarded for pioneering work in nanotechnology, towards the goal of constructing atomically precise products through molecular machine systems.  Input on prize candidates comes from both Foresight Institute personnel, and outside academic and commercial organizations.  The awardees are selected mainly by an annually changing body of former winners and other academics.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The prize is considered prestigious,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heinze|first=Thomas|last2=Shapira|first2=Philip|last3=Senker|first3=Jacqueline|last4=Kuhlmann|first4=Stefan|date=2007-01-01|title=Identifying creative research accomplishments: Methodology and results for nanotechnology and human genetics|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-007-0108-6|journal=Scientometrics|language=en|volume=70|issue=1|pages=125–152|doi=10.1007/s11192-007-0108-6|issn=0138-9130}}&lt;/ref&gt; and authors of one study considered it to be reasonably representative of notable research in the parts of nanotechnology under its scope.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marcovich|first=Anne|last2=Shinn|first2=Terry|date=December 1, 2010|title=Socio/intellectual patterns in nanoscale research: Feynman Nanotechnology Prize laureates, 1993–2007|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0539018410377581|journal=Social Science Information|volume=49|issue=4|pages=615–638|doi=10.1177/0539018410377581|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The seaprate Feynman Grand Prize is a $250,000 challenge award to the first persons to create both a nanoscale robotic arm capable of precise positional control, and a nanoscale 8-bit [[Adder (electronics)|adder]], conforming to given specifications. It is intended to stimulate the field of [[molecular nanotechnology]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://electroiq.com/blog/2004/10/diamandis-to-chair-feynman-grand-prize-committee/|title=Diamandis to chair Feynman Grand Prize committee {{!}} Solid State Technology|website=electroiq.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nicolau|first=D.E.|last2=Phillimore|first2=J.|last3=Cross|first3=R.|last4=Nicolau|first4=D.V|date=July 2000|title=Nanotechnology at the crossroads: the hard or the soft way?|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0026269200000367|journal=Microelectronics Journal|volume=31|issue=7|pages=611–616|doi=10.1016/s0026-2692(00)00036-7|issn=0026-2692|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davidian|first=Ken|date=2005|title=Prize Competitions and NASA’s Centennial Challenges Program|url=http://sci.esa.int/Conferences/ILC2005/Manuscripts/DavidianK-01-DOC.pdf|dead-url=|journal=International Lunar Conference|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Feynman Prize was instituted in the context of Foresight Institute co-founder [[K. Eric Drexler]]'s advocacy of funding for molecular manufacturing.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The prize was first given in 1993.  Before 1997, one prize was given biennially.  From 1997 on, two prizes were given each year in theory and experimental categories.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  By awarding these prizes early in the history of the field, the prize increased awareness of nanotechnology and influenced its direction.&lt;ref name="NewDim"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U-78AwAAQBAJ&amp;q=%22Feynman%20prize%22%20OR%20%22Feynman%20nanotechnology%20prize%22|title=Toward a New Dimension: Exploring the Nanoscale|last=Marcovich|first=Anne|last2=Shinn|first2=Terry|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=9780198714613|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|60}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stallbaumer|first=Clayton|date=2016|title=From Longitude to Altitude: Inducement Prize Contests as Instruments of Public Policy in Science and Technology|url=http://illinoisjltp.com/journal/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/stallbaumer.pdf|journal=Journal of Law, Technology &amp; Policy|volume=2006|issue=1|pages=117–158|via=University of Illinois|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nano-Hype"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rTPkmNLs870C&amp;pg=PA250|title=Nano-Hype: The Truth Behind the Nanotechnology Buzz|last=Berube|first=David M.|publisher=Prometheus Books|isbn=9781615922369|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Food miles''' is the distance [[food]] is [[transport]]ed from the time of its production until it reaches the [[consumer]]. Food miles are one factor used when assessing the [[Environmentalism|environmental]] impact of food, including the impact on [[global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Engelhaupt | first1 = E | year = 2008 | title = Do food miles matter? | url = | journal = Environmental Science &amp; Technology | volume = 42 | issue = | page = 3482 | doi=10.1021/es087190e}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of food miles originated in the early 2018s in the United Kingdom. It was conceived by Professor Tim Lang&lt;ref&gt;http://www.city.ac.uk/communityandhealth/phpcfp/foodpolicy/index.html.  He explains its history in this article Tim Lang (2006). 'locale / global (food miles)’, Slow Food (Bra, Cuneo Italy), 19, May 2006, p.94-97&lt;/ref&gt; at the Sustainable Agriculture Food and Environment (SAFE) Alliance&lt;ref&gt;The SAFE Alliance merged with the National Food Alliance in 1999 to become Sustain: the alliance for better food and farming http://www.sustainweb.org/. Professor Tim Lang chaired Sustain from 1999 to 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; and first appeared in print in a report “The Food Miles Report: The dangers of long-distance food transport”, researched and written by Angela Paxton.&lt;ref name="Paxton"&gt;Paxton, A (1994). The Food Miles Report: The dangers of long-distance food transport. SAFE Alliance, London, UK. http://www.sustainweb.org/publications/?id=191&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Iles, A. (2005). Learning in sustainable agriculture: Food miles and missing objects. Environmental Values, 14, 163-83&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars believe that an increase in the distance food travels is due to the [[globalization]] of trade; the focus of food supply bases into fewer, larger districts; drastic changes in delivery patterns; the increase in processed and packaged foods; and making fewer trips to the supermarket.  These make a small part of the [[greenhouse gas]] emissions created by food; 83% of overall emissions of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are in production phases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weber | first1 = C.
 | last2 = Matthews | first2 = H. | year = 2008
 | title = Food-Miles and the Relative Climate Impacts of Food Choices in the United States | url =
 | journal = Environmental Science &amp; Technology | volume = 42 | issue = 10| pages = 3508–3513
 | doi=10.1021/es702969f}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several studies compare emissions over the entire food cycle, including production, consumption, and transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/ww/localfood|title=Sources and Resources for “Local Food: The Economics” - Worldwatch Institute|author=|date=|website=www.worldwatch.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include estimates of food-related emissions of greenhouse gas 'up to the farm gate' versus 'beyond the farm gate'.  In the UK, for example, agricultural-related emissions may account for approximately 40% of the overall food chain (including retail, packaging, fertilizer manufacture, and other factors), whereas greenhouse gases emitted in transport account for around 12% of overall food-chain emissions.&lt;ref&gt;(Garnett 2011, Food Policy)&lt;/ref&gt;  Researchers are currently working to provide the public with more information.

The concept of "food miles" has been criticised, and food miles are not always correlated with the actual environmental impact of food production. In comparison, the percentage of total energy used in home food preparation is 26% and in food processing is 29%, far greater than transportation.&lt;ref&gt;John Hendrickson, "Energy use in the U.S. Food System: A summary of existing research and analysis." Sustainable Farming (Ste. Anne de Bellevue, Quebec), vol. 7, no. 4. Fall 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The concept of food miles is part of the broader issue of [[sustainability]] which deals with a large range of environmental, social and economic issues, including [[local food]]. The term was coined by Tim Lang (now Professor of Food Policy, [[City University, London]]) who says: "The point was to highlight the hidden ecological, social and economic consequences of food production to consumers in a simple way, one which had objective reality but also connotations."&lt;ref&gt;Tim Lang (2006). 'locale / global (food miles)’, Slow Food (Bra, Cuneo Italy), 19, May 2006, p.94-97&lt;/ref&gt;  The increased distance traveled by food in developed countries was caused by the globilization of food trade, which increased by 4 times since 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Erik Millstone and Tim Lang, The Atlas of Food, Earthscan, London, 1963, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Food that is transported by road produces more carbon emissions than any other form of transported food. Road transport produces 60% of the world's food transport carbon emissions. Air transport produces 20% of the world's food transport carbon emissions. Rail and sea transport produce 10% each of the world's food transport carbon emissions.

Although it was never intended as a complete measure of environmental impact, it has come under attack as an ineffective means of finding the true environmental impact. For example, a [[DEFRA]] report in 2005 undertaken by researchers at [[AEA Technology]] Environment, entitled ''The Validity of Food Miles as an Indicator of Sustainable Development'', included findings that "the direct environmental, social and economic costs of food transport are over £9 billion each year, and are dominated by congestion."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A. et al. (2005) The Validity of Food Miles as an Indicator of Sustainable Development: Final report. DEFRA, London. See https://statistics.defra.gov.uk/esg/reports/foodmiles/default.asp&lt;/ref&gt; The report also indicates that it is not only how far the food has travelled but the method of travel in all parts of the food chain that is important to consider. Many trips by personal cars to shopping centres would have a negative environmental impact compared to transporting a few truckloads to neighbourhood stores that can be easily reached by walking or cycling. More emissions are created by the drive to the supermarket to buy air freighted food than was created by the air freighting in the first place.&lt;ref name="motu.org.nz"&gt;http://www.motu.org.nz/files/docs/agdpresentations/AgD23_Saunders_-_Carbon_footprinting_and_other_trade_factors.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the positive environmental effects of [[organic farming]] may be compromised by increased [[transport]]ation, unless it is produced by local [[farm]]s.  The [[Carbon Trust]] notes that to understand the carbon emissions from food production, all the carbon-emitting processes that occur as a result of getting food from the field to our plates need to be considered, including production, origin, seasonality and home care.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carbontrust.com/news/2012/03/food-the-carbon-story "Food, the carbon story"], ''[[The Carbon Trust]]'', 15 March 2012.

==Food miles in business==
A recent study led by Professor Miguel Gomez (Applied Economics and Management), at [[Cornell University]] and supported by the [[Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future]] found that in many instances, the supermarket supply chain did much better in terms of food miles and fuel consumption for each pound compared to farmers markets.  It suggests that selling local foods through supermarkets may be more economically viable and sustainable than through farmers markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Prevor|first=Jim|title=Jim Prevor’s Perishable Pundit|url=http://www.perishablepundit.com/index.php?date=10/01/10&amp;pundit=1|accessdate=20 July 2011|date=1 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calculating food miles==

With processed foods that are made of many different ingredients, it is very complicated, though not impossible, to calculate the CO2 emissions from transport by multiplying the distance travelled of each ingredient, by the carbon intensity of the mode of transport (air, road or rail). However, as both Prof. Lang and the original Food Miles report noted, the resulting number – although interesting, cannot give the whole picture of how sustainable – or not – a food product is.&lt;ref name="Paxton"/&gt;

Wal-Mart publicized a press releasing that stated food traveled 1500 miles before it reaches customers. The shocking statistics aroused public concern about food miles. According to Jane Black, a food writer who covers food politics, the number was derived from a small database. The 22 terminal markets from which the data was collected handled 30% of the United States produce.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Black, "What’s in a Number: How the Press Got the Idea That Food Travels 1,500 Miles from Farm to Plate," Slate, September 17, 2008, www.slate.com/ id/ 2200202.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

=== Fair trade ===

According to Oxfam researchers, there are many other aspects of the agricultural processing and the food [[supply chain]] that also contribute to [[greenhouse gas]] emissions which are not taken into account by simple "food miles" measurements.&lt;ref name="ChiMacGregorKing"&gt;Chi, Kelly Rae, James MacGregor and Richard King (2009). [http://www.iied.org/pubs/display.php?o=15516IIED Fair Miles: Recharting the food miles map]. [[International Institute for Environment and Development|IIED]]/[[Oxfam]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chi, 2009, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; There are benefits to be gained by improving livelihoods in poor countries through agricultural development. Smallholder farmers in poor countries can often improve their income and standard of living if they can sell to distant export markets for higher value horticultural produce, moving away from the subsistence agriculture of producing staple crops for their own consumption or local markets.&lt;ref&gt;MacGregor, J.; Vorley, B (2006) Fair Miles? Weighing environmental and social impacts of fresh produce exports from Sub-Saharan Africa to the UK. Fresh Insights no.9. International Institute for Environment and Development/ Natural Resources Institute, London, UK, 18 pp. http://www.dfid.gov.uk/r4d/SearchResearchDatabase.asp?OutPutId=173492&lt;/ref&gt;

However, exports from poor countries do not always benefit poor people.  Unless the product has a Fairtrade label, or a label from another robust and independent scheme, food exports might make a bad situation worse. Only a very small percentage of what importers pay will end up in the hands of plantation workers.&lt;ref&gt;C. Dolan, J. Humphrey, and C. Harris-Pascal, "Value Chains and Upgrading: The Impact of U.K. Retailers on the Fresh Fruit and Vegetables Industry in Africa," Institute of Development Studies Working Paper 96, University of Sussex, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Wages are often very low and working conditions bad and sometimes dangerous.  Sometimes the food grown for export takes up land that had been used to grow food for local consumption, so local people can go hungry.&lt;ref&gt;Action Aid is one of many organisations drawing attention to this problem and campaigning to improve this situation - http://www.actionaid.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy used in production as well as transport ===
Researchers say a more complete environmental assessment of food that consumers buy needs to take into account how the food has been produced and what [[energy]] is used in its production. A recent DEFRA case study indicated that [[tomato]]es grown in [[Spain]] and transported to the [[United Kingdom]] may have a lower carbon footprint in terms of [[Efficient energy use|energy]] than heated [[greenhouse]]s in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://randd.defra.gov.uk/Default.aspx?Menu=Menu&amp;Module=More&amp;Location=None&amp;Completed=0&amp;ProjectID=15001|title=Defra, UK - Science Search|first=Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)|last=Department for Environment|date=|website=defra.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to German researchers, the food miles concept misleads consumers because the size of transportation and production units is not taken into account. Using the methodology of [[Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)]] in accordance with [[ISO 14000|ISO 14040]], entire supply chains providing German consumers with food were investigated, comparing local food with food of European and global provenance. Large-scale agriculture reduces unit costs associated with food production and transportation, leading to increased efficiency and decreased energy use per kilogram of food by [[economies of scale]]. Research from the [[Justus Liebig University Giessen]] show that small food production operations may cause even more environmental impact than bigger operations in terms of [[energy use]] per kilogram, even though food miles are lower. Case studies of lamb, beef, wine, apples, fruit juices and pork show that the concept of food miles is too simple to account for all factors of food production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-giessen.de/fbr09/pt/PT_Ecology_of_Scale.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schlich E, Fleissner U: The Ecology of Scale. Assessment of Regional Energy Turnover and Comparison with Global Food. Int J LCA 10 (3) 219-223:2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schlich E: Energy Economics and the Ecology of Scale in the Food Business. In: Caldwell PG and Taylor EV (editors): New Research on Energy Economics. [[Nova Science Publishers]] Hauppauge NY:2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A 2006 research report from the Agribusiness and Economics Research Unit at [[Lincoln University, New Zealand]] counters claims about food miles by comparing total energy used in [[food production]] in [[Europe]] and [[New Zealand]], taking into account energy used to ship the food to Europe for consumers.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, C; Barber, A; Taylor, G, [http://www.lincoln.ac.nz/Documents/2328_RR285_s13389.pdf  Food Miles – Comparative Energy/Emissions Performance of New Zealand’s Agriculture Industry] (2006). Research Report No. 285. Agribusiness and Economics Research Unit, [[Lincoln University (New Zealand)|Lincoln University]], Christchurch, New Zealand.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McWilliams&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/06/opinion/06mcwilliams.html?_r=1&amp;oref=login&amp;oref=slogin |title=Food that travels well |first=James E. |last=McWilliams |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |date=2007-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The report states, "New Zealand has greater production efficiency in many food commodities compared to the UK. For example New Zealand [[agriculture]] tends to apply fewer [[fertilizer]]s (which require large amounts of energy to produce and cause significant [[CO2 emissions]]) and animals are able to [[grazing|graze]] year round outside eating grass instead of large quantities of brought-in [[compound feed|feed]] such as [[concentrate]]s. In the case of [[Dairy product|dairy]] and [[Lamb and mutton|sheep meat]] production NZ is by far more [[Efficient energy use|energy efficient]], even including the transport cost, than the UK, twice as efficient in the case of dairy, and four times as efficient in case of sheep meat.&lt;ref name="motu.org.nz"/&gt; In the case of [[apple]]s, NZ is more energy-efficient even though the energy embodied in capital items and other inputs data was not available for the UK."

Other researchers have contested the claims from New Zealand. Professor Gareth Edwards-Jones has said that the arguments “in favour of New Zealand apples shipped to the UK is probably true only or about two months a year, during July and August, when the carbon footprint for locally grown fruit doubles because it comes out of cool stores.”&lt;ref&gt;'Food miles' minor element of carbon footprint, http://www.freshplaza.com/news_detail.asp?id=40471.  See also a range of publications by Professor Edwards-Jones and a team of researchers at Bangor University, http://www.bangor.ac.uk/senrgy/staff/edwards.php.en&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies by Dr. Christopher Weber et al. of the total [[carbon footprint]] of food production in the U.S. have shown transportation to be of minor importance, compared to the carbon emissions resulting from pesticide and fertilizer production, and the fuel required by farm and food processing equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/es702969f | volume=42 | title=Food-Miles and the Relative Climate Impacts of Food Choices in the United States | year=2008 | journal=Environmental Science | pages=3508–3513 | last1 = Weber | first1 = Christopher L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Livestock production as a source of greenhouse gases ===
	
Farm animals account for between 20% and 30% of global [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.&lt;ref&gt;To see details of the United Nations research into meat and the environment, visit: http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2006/1000448/index.html. See also Steinfeld, H et al. (2006) Livestock’s long shadow: Environmental issues and options. [[Food and Agriculture Organization]], Rome. {{cite web |url=http://www.virtualcentre.org/en/library/key_pub/longshad/A0701E00.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140806144540/http://www.virtualcentre.org/en/library/key_pub/longshad/A0701E00.htm |archivedate=2014-08-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garnett, T (2007) Meat and dairy production and consumption. Exploring the livestock sector’s contribution to the [[Greenhouse gas emissions by the United Kingdom|UK’s greenhouse gas emissions]] and assessing what less greenhouse gas intensive systems of production
and consumption might look like Working paper produced a part of the work of the Food Climate Research Network, Centre for Environmental Strategy, [[University of Surrey]] http://www.fcrn.org.uk/fcrnPublications/publications/PDFs/Livestock_paper_2006.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.skepticalscience.com/how-much-meat-contribute-to-gw.html|title=How much does animal agriculture and eating meat contribute to global warming?|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;That figure includes the clearing of land to feed and graze the animals. Clearing land of trees, and cultivation, are the main drivers of farming emissions. [[Deforestation]] eliminates [[carbon sinks]], accelerating the process of [[climate change]]. Cultivation, including the use of [[synthetic fertiliser]]s, releases greenhouse gases such as [[nitrous oxide]]. [[Nitrogen fertiliser]] is especially demanding of [[fossil fuels]], as producing a tonne of it takes 1.5 tonnes of oil.&lt;ref name="ChiMacGregorKing"/&gt;

Meanwhile, it’s increasingly recognised that [[meat]] and [[Dairy product|dairy]] are the largest sources of food-related emissions. The UK’s consumption of meat and dairy products (including imports) accounts for about 8% of national [[Greenhouse gas emissions by the United Kingdom|greenhouse gas emissions]]  related to consumption.&lt;ref name="ChiMacGregorKing"/&gt;

According to a study by engineers Christopher Weber and H. Scott Matthews of [[Carnegie Mellon University]], of all the greenhouse gases emitted by the food industry, only 4% comes from transporting the food from producers to retailers. The study also concluded that adopting a [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian diet]], even if the vegetarian food is transported over very long distances, does far more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, than does eating a locally grown diet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.mongabay.com/2008/0602-ucsc_liaw_food_miles.html Food miles are less important to environment than food choices, study concludes], Jane Liaw, special to [[Mongabay]], June 2, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; They also concluded that "Shifting less than one day per week’s worth of calories from [[red meat]] and [[dairy products]] to chicken, fish, eggs, or a vegetable-based diet achieves more GHG reduction than buying all locally sourced food." In other words, the amount of red meat consumption is much more important than food miles.

=== "Local" food miles ===

A commonly ignored element is the [[last mile]]. For example, a gallon of gasoline could transport 5&amp;nbsp;kg of meat over {{convert|60000|mi|km}} by road (40 tonner at 8 mpg) in [[bulk transport]], or it could transport a single consumer only 30 or {{convert|40|mi|km}} to buy that meat.  Thus foods from a distant farm that are transported in bulk to a nearby store  consumer can have a lower footprint than foods a consumer picks up directly from a farm that is within driving distance but farther away than the store. This can mean that doorstep deliveries of food by companies can lead to lower carbon emissions or energy use than normal shopping practices.&lt;ref&gt;Coley, D. A., Howard, M. and Winter, M., 2009. Local food, food miles and carbon emissions: A comparison of farm shop and mass distribution approaches. Food Policy, 34 (2), pp. 150-155.&lt;/ref&gt;  Relative distances and mode of transportation make this calculation complicated.  For example, consumers can significantly reduce the carbon footprint of the [[last mile]] by walking, bicycling, or taking public transport.  Another impact is that goods being transported by large ships very long distances can have lower associated carbon emissions or energy use than the same goods traveling by truck a much shorter distance.&lt;ref&gt;Coley, D. A., Howard, M. and Winter, M., 2011. Food miles: time for a re-think? British Food Journal, 113 (7), pp. 919-934.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lifecycle analysis, rather than food miles ===

[[life cycle assessment|Lifecycle analysis]], a technique that meshes together a wide range of different environmental criteria including emissions and waste, is a more holistic way of assessing the real environmental impact of the food we eat. The technique accounts for energy input and output involved in the production, processing, packaging and transport of food. It also factors in [[resource depletion]], [[air|air pollution]] and [[water pollution]] and waste generation/[[municipal solid waste]].&lt;ref&gt;Chi, Kelly Rae, James MacGregor and Richard King (2009). Fair Miles: Recharting the food miles map. IIED/Oxfam. http://www.iied.org/pubs/display.php?o=15516IIED – p16&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of organisations are developing ways of calculating the carbon cost or lifecycle impact of food and agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Examples include http://www.carbontrustcertification.com/ and www.cffcarboncalculator.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt; Some are more robust than others but, at the moment, there is no easy way to tell which ones are thorough, independent and reliable, and which ones are just marketing hype.

Even a full lifecycle analysis accounts only for the environmental effects of food production and consumption.  However it is one of the widely agreed three pillars of sustainable development, namely environmental, social and economic.&lt;ref&gt;World Commission on Environment and Development, Our Common Future, (1987). Oxford University Press. Often known as the Brundtland report, after the Chair of the Commission, Gro Harlem Brundtland.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wiktionary|headliner}}
A '''headliner''' is the main act in a [[music]], [[theatre]], or [[Stand-up comedy|comedy]] performance.  Generally, the headliner is the final act in a performance, preceded by the [[Opening act|opening act(s)]].

In ticket sales, the name of the headlining act will generally be the only name or most prominent name on the ticket or advertising vehicle.

In [[music]], the headliner often reserves sole permissions to the name of the tour.  Thus, tour names often reflect the name of the latest album or a popular song from the latest album of the headliner.  Additionally, the headliner is often the most famous or prominent act in the performance.

In [[Neo-Burlesque]], headliners are performers with high reputations whose inclusion in a performance will help to attract a good audience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swburlesqueshowcase/performers/headliners South West Burlesque Showcase, Albuquerque, 2015; Headliners]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Card_(sports)#Main_event|main event]] is a similar concept in sports.

==History==
The term "headliner" dates back to the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/headliner Headliner | Define Headliner at Dictionary.com] reference.com.  Retrieved April 06, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Demographics and Culture of Hong Kong}}
{{Template: English language}}

'''Hong Kong English''' ({{zh|t=港式英文}}) is the [[dialect]] of the [[English language]] most commonly used in [[Hong Kong]]. The dialect is a result of Hong Kong's [[British Hong Kong|British overseas territory history]] and the influence of native [[Cantonese]] speakers.

Being a former British colony, Hong Kong predominantly uses British spellings.  Pronunciations and words are also predominantly British{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}, although influences from American, Canadian and [[Australian English]] do exist as a result of [[Hollywood movies]], TV and Internet culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/section-news.php?id=162861&amp;story_id=45510027&amp;d_str=20151105|title=British or American spellings?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, a lot of Hong Kong Chinese families migrated to (in alphabetical order) Australia, Canada,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/education-community/article/2110557/last-year-saw-highest-number-hongkongers|title=Number of Hongkongers migrating to Canada hits 20-year high|publisher=|date=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ireland, New Zealand and the United States in the 1990s after [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] in [[mainland China]], and when they move back they are less likely to use [[British English]]. There is also an influence from the significant non-Chinese demographic (e.g., expats and [[Foreign domestic helpers in Hong Kong|maids]]). The [[Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority]] accepts "all varieties of English" as "[e]xaminers come from many different places."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hkeaa.edu.hk/en/LPAT/faq/eng/eng_all.html|title=Frequently Asked Questions on LPAT - English Language|website=www.hkeaa.edu.hk}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to article 9 of the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]], "English may also be used as an official language" but the law does not specify which [[varieties of English|type of English]].

'''Cantonese English''', locally referred to as [[Chinglish]], in theory, refers to the [[Accent (dialect)|accent]] and characteristics of English spoken by native [[Hong Kongers]] and other [[Cantonese people]]. Overall, it is primarily spoken by native Hong Kong language (Cantonese) speakers. Therefore, although it is called ''Hong Kong English'', it is not only spoken in Hong Kong. People who come from [[Macau]], [[Guangzhou]], or whose first language is Cantonese speak it.

==Background==
English is one of the [[official language]]s in Hong Kong, and is used widely in the [[Hong Kong Government|Government]], [[list of universities in Hong Kong|academic circles]], [[Economy of Hong Kong|business]] and the [[Judiciary of Hong Kong|courts]]. All road and government signs are bilingual and English is as equally valid as Chinese in legal and business standings. English is what distinguished most and those who spoke English or were taught English were considered the elite, meaning those able to be taught English were considered upperclassmen. This conceptualized way of thinking arose in 1984.&lt;ref name=Eoyang&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eoyang|first=Eugene Chen|title=From the Imperial to the Empirical: Teaching English in Hong Kong|journal=Profession|pages=62–74|jstor=25595704}}&lt;/ref&gt; This dialect is its own category and is the standard in Hong Kong.&lt;ref name=Eoyang/&gt;
  
People with higher education, past experience of living in English-speaking countries, or who constantly interact with Hong Kong's English-speaking [[expatriate]] communities, generally speak an acquired form of English. [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|Accent]] and [[spelling]] preference may vary from person to person, depending on the people they have interacted with and the country they have studied in. For most ordinary local Hong Kongers however, the English spoken is generally typical of [[foreign language]] learners: Cantonese-influenced pronunciation with some acquired [[Received Pronunciation]] characteristics, and with vocabularies and sentence structure generally more formal than those of native speakers. For instance, contractions and slang are not used, and many idioms are alien to Hong Kongers because the terms pertain more to the cultures of English-speaking countries.
The falling English proficiency of local English language teachers has come under criticism.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|Handover]], English in Hong Kong remains primarily a second language, in contrast to Singapore where English has been shifting toward being a first language.

==Status==
Thirty-five years ago, it was argued that there was no such thing as Hong Kong English,&lt;ref&gt;Luke, K. K. &amp; Richards, J. (1982). English in Hong Kong: Functions and status. ''English World-Wide'', 3: 47-61.&lt;/ref&gt; but nowadays its status is much more established.&lt;ref name="SWC"&gt;{{cite-book|last1=Setter|first1=Jane|authorlink1=Jane Setter|last2=Wong|first2=Cathy S.P.|last3=Chan|first3=Brian H.S.|year=2010|title=Hong Kong English|location=Edinburgh|publisher=Edinburgh University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Dynamic Model of Postcolonial Englishes, it has been classified as in the third phase, that of Nativization,&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, E. W. (2007), ''Postcolonial English: Varieties around the world''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; but more recently it has been shown that many young people are happy to identify themselves as speakers of Hong Kong English, so it might be regarded as progressing into the fourth phase, that of Endonormative Stabilization.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen Edwards, J. G. (2015). Hong Kong English: Attitudes, identity and use. ''Asian Englishes'', 17: 184-208.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that Hong Kong English is highly intelligible to listeners from elsewhere,&lt;ref&gt;Kirkpatrick, A., Deterding, D., &amp; Wong, J. (2008). The international intelligibility of Hong Kong English. ''World Englishes'', 27, 359–377.&lt;/ref&gt; which helps explain why an increasing number of people are happy to be identified as speakers of this variety.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen Edwards, J. G. (2016). The politics of language and identity: Attitudes towards Hong Kong English pre- and post- the Umbrella Movement. ''Asian Englishes'', 18(2), 157-164.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pronunciation==
Although it may be assumed that, as a result of the colonial legacy, the pronunciation of Hong Kong English was originally based on British English,&lt;ref name="Hung2012"&gt;Hung, T. N. (2012). Hong Kong English. In E. L. Low &amp; Azirah Hashim (Eds.), ''English in Southeast Asia: Features, policy and language in use'' (pp. 113-133). Amsterdam: John Benjamins.&lt;/ref&gt; in fact nowadays there are many features of pronunciation derived from American English,&lt;ref name="SWC"/&gt; and indeed the influence of American English appears to be increasing.&lt;ref name="Chan2013"&gt;Chan, J. Y. H. (2013). Contextual variation in Hong Kong English. ''World Englishes'', 32, 54-74.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, there seem to be some innovative developments that are unique to Hong Kong English, such as a split in the realisation of /v/ as [f] or [w].&lt;ref name="Hung2007"&gt;Hung, T. N. (2007). Innovation in second language phonology. In T. Hoffmann &amp; L. Siebers (Eds.), ''World Englishes: Problems, properties and prospects'' (pp. 227-237). Amsterdam: John Benjamins.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the more salient features are listed below.

===Segments===
* There is a tendency for {{IPAslink|θ}} to undergo [[Th-fronting|fronting]] and become {{ipa|[f]}}, so ''through'' may be pronounced as {{ipa|[fɹu]}},&lt;ref name="SWC"/&gt; and ''three'' may be {{ipa|[fɹi]}}.&lt;ref name="DWK2008"&gt;Deterding, D., Wong J., &amp; Kirkpatrick, A. (2008). The pronunciation of Hong Kong English. ''English World-Wide'', 29, 148–149.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is variable, so some speakers pronounce ''thin'' as {{ipa|[θɪn]}} while others pronounce it as {{ipa|[fin]}}.&lt;ref name="Hung2002"&gt;Hong, T. N. (2002). Towards a phonology of Hong Kong English. In K. Bolton (Ed.), ''Hong Kong English: Autonomy and creativity'' (pp. 119–140). Hong Kong: Hong Kong University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The voiceless TH sound may be pronounced as [θ] at the beginning of words, but [f] usually occurs at the end.&lt;ref name="Sewell2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sewell|first=Andrew|year=2009|title=World Englishes, English as a Lingua Franca, and the case of Hong Kong English|journal=English Today|volume=25|issue=1|pages=37–43|doi=10.1017/S0266078409000066}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{ipa|/ð/}} tends to be [d], so ''this'' is [dis],&lt;ref name="Hung2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sewell2009"/&gt; and ''whether'' is {{ipa|[wedə]}}.&lt;ref name=DWK2008/&gt;
* /v/ may be {{ipa|[w]}} or {{ipa|[f]}}, so ''event'' may have [w] while ''even'' has [f]. It seems that [w] occurs at the start of a stressed syllable while [f] occurs at the start of an unstressed syllable.&lt;ref name="Hung2007"/&gt;
* There is alternation between [l] and [n], and the same speaker may alternate with words such as ''light'' and ''night'', and both ''loud'' and ''number'' may have either [l] or [n] at the start.&lt;ref name="Hung2007"/&gt;
* In initial consonant clusters, [l] sometimes occurs in place of {{ipa|[ɹ]}}, so ''crowded'' may have [l] while ''problem'' often begins with [pl].&lt;ref name="DWK2008"/&gt;
* /w/ may be omitted from initial /kw/ clusters before a rounded vowel, so ''quote'' is {{ipa|[koʊt]}} and ''quarter'' is {{ipa|[kɔtə]}}.&lt;ref name="Hung2007"/&gt;
* In final consonant clusters, just as with many other varieties of English, there is a tendency for simplification, so the plosive at the end of words such as ''think'' and ''camp'' is often omitted. Deletion of coronal plosives /t/ and /d/ from word-final clusters has been reported to occur in about 76% of tokens, though this frequency is a little less if the function words ''and'' and ''just'' are excluded from the analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen Edwards, J. G. (2016). Sociolinguistic variation in Asian Englishes: The case of coronal stop deletion. ''English World-Wide'' 37(2), 138-167.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[l-vocalization|L-vocalisation]] is common, so dark /l/ in the coda of a syllable is often pronounced as {{IPA|[ʊ]}}, and ''fill'' may be {{IPA|[fɪʊ]}} while ''tell'' is {{IPA|[teʊ]}}, just as in London English (Cockney).&lt;ref name="Hung2012"/&gt; After back rounded vowels /l/ is often omitted, so ''school'' is {{IPA|[skʉː]}} and ''wall'' is {{IPA|[wɔː]}}.&lt;ref name="DWK2008"/&gt;
* Like many accents in Britain, Hong Kong English is [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|non-rhotic]], so {{ipa|/ɹ/}} is only pronounced before a vowel. However, with the growing influence of American English, many young people in Hong Kong now pronounce the {{ipa|/ɹ/}} in the coda of a syllable.&lt;ref name="Chan2013"/&gt;
* There is often little distinction between the non-close front vowels, {{IPA|/æ/}} and {{IPA|/ɛ/}}, so ''bet'' and ''bat'' may be pronounced the same (with [ɛ]).&lt;ref name="Hung2012"/&gt;
* Long and short vowels are generally merged, particularly involving the close vowels {{IPA|/iː/}} and {{IPA|/ɪ/}} (so ''heat'' and ''hit'' are similar) as well as {{IPA|/uː/}} and {{IPA|/ʊ/}} (so ''pull'' and ''pool'' are the same).&lt;ref name="Hung2012"/&gt;
* Vowel reduction is often avoided in function words, so a full vowel occurs in words such as ''and'' and ''to'' as well as the first syllable of content words such as ''accept'' and ''patrol''.&lt;ref name="DWK2008"/&gt;

===Intonation===
* Multi-[[syllable]] words are often differently stressed. For example, while the word "[[latte]]" is pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|æ|t|eɪ}} in most variants of the English language, it is usually pronounced {{ipa|/laˈtʰei̯/}} in Hong Kong English, with the second syllable stressed instead of the first.
* Omission of entire "r-" syllables in longer words; "difference" becomes {{ipa|/ˈtifɐns/}}, and "temperature" becomes {{ipa|/ˈtʰɛmpʰit͡sʰœ/}}.
* Words beginning with unstressed syllables "con" are generally pronounced its stressed form {{ipa|/kʰɔn/}} with a lower pitch, e.g. "connection", "consent", "condition". Words beginning with stressed syllable "com-" e.g. "competition", "common" and "compromise" are pronounced {{ipa|/kʰǎm/}}.
* The [[schwa]] tends to be pronounced as {{ipa|/ɛ/}} in final closed syllables; "ticket" is pronounced {{ipa|/ˈtʰe̝kʰɛt̚/}}, and "carpet" is pronounced {{ipa|/ˈkʰapʰɛt̚/}}.
* The suffix -age is generally pronounced {{ipa|/ei̯tʃ/}}; "message" is pronounced {{ipa|/ˈmɛsei̯tʃ/}}, "package" is pronounced {{ipa|/ˈpʰɛkʰei̯tʃ/}} etc.
* There is less [[Stress and vowel reduction in English|vowel reduction in unstressed syllables]], and some variation in the placement of stress. For example, ''chocolate'' may be pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|ɒ|k|oʊ|l|eɪ|t}}, as distinct from {{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|ɒ|k|l|ə|t}} in other varieties of English.&lt;ref name=Sewell&gt;{{cite-book|year=2017|last=Sewell|first=Andrew|chapter=Pronunciation Assessment in Asia's World City: Implications of a Lingua Franca Approach in Hong Kong|editors=Isaacs T. &amp; Trofimovich P.|title=Second Language Pronunciation Assessment: Interdisciplinary Perspectives|pages=237–255|location=Bristol|publisher=Multilingual Matters / Channel View Publications|url= https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.21832/j.ctt1xp3wcc.17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Compared to other varieties of English, there is less difference between [[Stress (linguistics)|stressed]] and unstressed syllables. In most varieties of English, unstressed syllables are reduced, taking less time. This difference is smaller in Hong Kong English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2006|last=Setter|first=Jane|title=Speech Rhythm in World Englishes: The Case of Hong Kong|journal=TESOL Quarterly|volume=40|issue=4|pages=763–782|doi=10.2307/40264307|jstor=40264307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Others===
*In Cantonese, there is no structure of diphthong+consonant. As a result, {{IPA|/eɪn/}} becomes {{ipa|/e̝ŋ/}}, {{IPA|/eɪm/}} becomes {{ipa|/ɛm/}}, {{IPA|/ɔɪn/}} becomes {{ipa|/ɔn/}}, {{IPA|/oʊn/}} becomes {{ipa|/o̝ŋ/}}, {{IPA|/aʊn/}} becomes {{ipa|/aŋ/}}, {{IPA|/eɪk/}} becomes {{ipa|/e̝k̚/}}, {{IPA|/oʊk/}} becomes {{ipa|/o̝k̚/}}, {{IPA|/eɪl/}} becomes {{ipa|/ɛu̯/}} etc.
* For the case {{IPA|/aɪn/}}, {{IPA|/aɪt/}} or {{IPA|/aɪk/}}, the ending consonant is generally omitted, resulting in {{IPA|/aɪ/}}.
* Many Chinese will speak a foreign language with the same characteristic monosyllabic staccato of spoken Chinese, with varying degrees of the natural liaisons between syllables that natives employ. In a similar vein, they often pronounce syllables as if words were transliterated into Cantonese: "Cameron" is pronounced as [ˈkʰɛmmalɔn] based on its transliteration; "basic" is pronounced as [ˈpei̯se̝k̚].
* When speaking English, many people tend to assign one of the six tones (or nine, if entering tones are included) of the [[Cantonese]] to different words, giving it a Cantonese style. E.g. most Hong Kongers would pronounce "there" and "their" differently, giving a higher pitch to "there" {{ipa|/ˈtɛ́/}} (tone 1 in Cantonese) and a lower pitch to "their" {{ipa|/ˈtɛ̀/}} (tone 6 in Cantonese).
* Exaggeration of certain final consonants, for example {{ipa|/s/}} to {{ipa|/si˩/}} and {{ipa|/d/}} sounds of the past-tense form of verbs to {{ipa|/tət̚˩/}}).
* Differences or omission in ending sounds, as the ending [[consonants]] are always [[voiceless]] and unreleased ([[glottal stop|glotallised]]) in Cantonese with the exceptions of {{ipa|/m/}}, {{ipa|/n/}} and {{ipa|/ŋ/}}, similar to [[Basel German]])
* Pronouncing the silent {{ipa|/w/}}, {{ipa|/h/}} sounds in words like "Green-wich", "Bon-ham", "Chat-ham", "Beck-ham" are often reflected in the transliteration of the words, for example, Beckham is transliterated 碧咸 (pronounced {{ipa|/pɪk̚˥ haːm˩/}}).
* Merging the contrast of [[voiceless]]/[[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]] consonants with [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]]/[[unaspirated]] if any contrast exists in Cantonese. This is because English voiceless consonants are most often aspirated, whereas the voiced ones are always unaspirated. The stop {{IPA|/p/}} becomes {{ipa|/pʰ/}} and {{IPA|/b/}} becomes {{ipa|/p/}}; {{IPA|/t/}} becomes {{ipa|/tʰ/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} becomes {{ipa|/t/}}; {{IPA|/k/}} becomes {{ipa|/kʰ/}} and {{IPA|/ɡ/}} becomes {{ipa|/k/}}; {{IPA|/tʃ/}} becomes {{ipa|/tsʰ/}} and {{IPA|/dʒ/}} becomes {{ipa|/ts/}} (except when preceded by s, where the English consonants are unaspirated).
* Merging voiceless/voiced consonants into voiceless if there is no contrast in aspirated/unaspirated in Cantonese. Both {{ipa|/f/}} and {{ipa|/v/}} become {{ipa|/f/}}; both {{ipa|/z/}} and {{ipa|/s/}} become {{ipa|/s/}}; both {{ipa|/ʃ/}} and {{ipa|/ʒ/}} become {{ipa|/s/}}; the only exception might be that {{ipa|/θ/}} and {{ipa|/ð/}} are never confused, due to difficulty in pronouncing {{ipa|/θ/}} and {{ipa|/ð/}}: many pronounce {{ipa|/θ/}} as {{ipa|/f/}}, and {{ipa|/ð/}} as {{ipa|/t/}}.
* Confusion between homographs (words with the same spelling but different meanings), e.g. the noun "resume" (c.v.) and the verb "resume" (to continue).

== Grammar==
{{Prose|section|date=June 2018}}
* Omitting articles like "the" and "a".
* Contractions such as "aren't" are almost never used, even in conversations, as English in Hong Kong is used largely for formal writing.
* Confusion with verb tenses and agreement of singular or plural nouns, as they have no direct equivalents in Chinese grammar (Mandarin and Cantonese).  Or because that verb tenses are expressed using a preposition or exclamation words at the end of the sentence.
* Use of prepositions: "on", "in" and "at" are often interchangeable.  Prepositions are also sometimes omitted after transitive verbs.  For example: "I will wait you at my flat," instead of "I will wait for you at my flat."
* Over the phone, "This is [John]" becomes "I am [John]", a direct translation.
* Yes/No confusion: In Cantonese, "yes" represents an agreement, "no" represents a disagreement, whilst in English "yes" represents a positive answer, "no" represents a negative answer. For example: "She isn't pretty, is she?" might attract the answer "No" when the native Cantonese speaker means "I disagree, in my opinion she is pretty".
* "There is/are" becomes "there has/have", a direct translation.
* Plural forms: there are no plural forms in Chinese, so plural and singular forms tend to be confused. The exclamation "Congratulation!" is often heard during expressions of joy for one's achievements.
* "Actually" (also "In fact") is used much more frequently in Hong Kong English than in standard English. The Cantonese equivalent, 其實 ("keih sat"), is used more frequently than "actually" is used in standard English.
* Using "lend" and "borrow" interchangeably. e.g. "I will borrow you my car" (real meaning: "I will lend you my car"). In Chinese, the word 借 is commonly used for both meanings.
* Using "rent" and "let" interchangeably. 
* Omitting -ed and -ing. e.g. "He is charm.", "I feel touch." (real meaning: "He is charming.", "I feel touched.")
* Using -ed and -ing interchangeably, e.g. "bored" and "boring". e.g. "I am so boring!" (real meaning: "I am so bored!"). In Chinese, the word 無聊 is commonly used for both meanings.
* Using "win" instead of "beat". e.g. "I win you in the race!" (real meaning: "I beat you in the race!"). In Chinese, the word 贏 is commonly used for both meanings.
* Using "hear" instead of "listen". e.g. "I hear the radio" (real meaning: "I listen to the radio"). In Chinese, the word 聽 is commonly  used for both meanings.

==Numbers==
* 10,000: Numbers larger than ten thousand. In Chinese, 10 thousand is read as one [[myriad]] (萬), 100 thousand as 10 myriad, one million as 100 myriad. Despite this, most people will not use the English word "myriad" so this type of English is hardly ever seen.
* Fractions: In Chinese, the denominator is read before the numerator, so "three over four" (or three-fourths) may be misunderstood as "four over three". In this example, three-fourths in Chinese is "四分之三", literally "out of four portions, three".
* Discounts: the Chinese way of saying 10% off is "90% of the original price". This is often written as 9折 (or 九折) which is understood to mean "discounted to 9/10 of the original price". When two digits are given the divisor is understood to be 100, e.g. 75折 (or 七五折) means 25% off.

==American/British spelling and word usage==
[[File:TSTNewWorldCentre.jpg|thumb|200px|This is the entrance of the shopping centre "[[New World Centre]]" in Hong Kong. Note the spelling of the word "Centre" (instead of the American English "Center") and also that it does not say "Mall", as in the US.]]
* Both [[British English|British]] and [[American English|American]] spellings are in common use, with the British variant predominating in official circles.
* When referring to the same thing, British vocabulary is more commonly used, for example: ''bin'' instead of ''garbage can''; ''lift'' (𨋢)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.csb.gov.hk/hkgcsb/glossary/glossary_search_tc.php?search_name1=lift | title=公務員事務局}}&lt;/ref&gt; instead of ''[[elevator]]''; ''mobile phone'' instead of ''[[cell phone]]''; ''estate agent''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eaa.org.hk/|title=Estate Agents Authority 地產代理監管局|website=www.eaa.org.hk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.csb.gov.hk/hkgcsb/glossary/glossary_search_en.php?search_name1=estate+agent | title=Civil Service Bureau}}&lt;/ref&gt; instead of ''[[real estate broker]]''; ''[[Fish and chips|chips]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/magazines/hk-magazine/article/2037916/hong-kongs-best-fish-and-chips|title=Hong Kong's Best Fish and Chips|publisher=|date=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://hk.lifestyle.appledaily.com/lifestyle/food/daily/article/20140728/18811988 尋找完美 Fish &amp; Chips]&lt;/ref&gt; instead of ''[[french fries]]''.
* [[The Center]] (中環中心) is a rare example of American spelling in Hong Kong.

==Variations==
* end-word: In informal conversation like instant messengers, [[sentence-final particle]]s or [[interjections]] of Cantonese [[Etymology|origin]] such as ''ah'', ''lah'', ''law'', ''mah'' and ''waw'''—many of these being "[[Chinese grammar|flavouring particle]]s"—are used at the ends of English [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s.
* "I've eaten dinner law" ("I've had dinner"—“law" {{IPA|/lɔː˧/}} indicates a [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]] and makes the sentence more informal)
* "I go lah, bye" ("I'm leaving, bye!"—“lah" {{IPA|/laː˧/}} indicates intent and makes the sentence more informal)

Some words and phrases widely understood in Hong Kong are rare or unheard of elsewhere.  These often derive from Chinese, [[Anglo-Indian]] or Portuguese/[[Macanese language|Macanese]].
* A '[[Chop (device)|chop]]' is a seal or stamp, e.g. a "Company chop" is the seal or stamp of a corporation (It actually originates from colonial Indian English.) It is now used in some other Commonwealth countries as a non-official term
* A ''[[Tai-Pan]]'' (or 'taipan') is a term used in the early 20th century for a business executive of a large corporation.
* An ''[[Amah (occupation)|amah]]'' is a term used in the early 20th century for a live-in servant (from Macanese/Portuguese- ''ama'' nurse); now supplanted by "[[Foreign domestic helpers in Hong Kong|&lt;nowiki&gt;[domestic]&lt;/nowiki&gt; helper]]"
* A 'shroff' is a cashier in a hospital, a government office or a car park (parking garage).
* "Godown" is a [[warehouse]] From the Malay "gudang".&lt;ref&gt;Cassell giant paperback dictionary, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Nullah]]'' is a concrete-lined canal or an re-enforced creek bed used to contain run-off.  ''Nullah'' entered the English language from Hindi.  The word nullah is used almost exclusively in Hong Kong.
*''Lai see'' means Lucky money.
*'FILTH'/'Filth' ('''F'''ailed '''i'''n '''L'''ondon, '''T'''ry '''H'''ongkong&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/Failed+in+London,+Try+Hong+Kong|title=Failed in London, Try Hong Kong|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lam|first1=Lana|last2=Lee|first2=Danny|title=Playwright pens tale of Hong Kong and its expat 'filth'|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1387830/playwright-pens-tale-hong-kong-and-its-expat-filth|work=South China Morning Post|accessdate=5 August 2014|date=2013-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a slang expression used to refer to people who look for employment opportunities in Hong Kong after being unsuccessful in looking for a job in the United Kingdom.
* The word 'seldom' is used instead of 'rarely' in informal English – the word seldom is considered formal in English speaking countries.
* A [[raffle]] is invariably referred to as a 'lucky draw'. 
* ''Jetso'' ("著數") is sometimes used to mean ''discount'' or ''special offer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getjetso.com/|title=Get Jetso著數網- 全港最受歡迎的著數優惠分享平台|accessdate=5 August 2014|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=June 2018}} 
* 'Hong Kong foot', a literal translation of the Chinese slang term "香港腳" for [[athlete's foot]]. An early record for the Chinese name was found in Chen Jun Bao's diary (陳君葆日記),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cp1897.com.hk/product_info.php?BookId=9620743466|title=陳君葆日記(上下冊)|last=商務印書館|website=www.cp1897.com.hk}}&lt;/ref&gt; where an entry from 1944-08-03 claimed the term was named by Shanghaiese, while Hongkongers called it 'Singapore foot' (星加坡腳), and Singaporean called it 'Manila foot' (曼尼剌腳).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://okplaymayday.pixnet.net/blog/post/30253264|title=香港腳的由來──中國歷史上的香港腳與腳氣 @ 漫遊於歷史與現代之間 :: 痞客邦 |first=okplaymayday|last=(okplaymayday)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Singapore foot' is still used by Singaporean media as of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mothership.sg/2017/10/singapore-foot-dhoby-itch-were-nasty-ailments-in-1920s-singapore/|title='Singapore foot' &amp; 'dhoby itch' were nasty ailments in 1920s Singapore|website=Mothership.sg}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The word 'cheap' can mean "of good value" in formal English.  In Hong Kong English, the word 'cheap' tends towards the more derogatory connotation, meaning something is of low quality and distasteful.

Research is also being done on the generation of new Hong Kong English vocabulary driven by computer mediated communication between bilingual Cantonese and English speakers. Rather than using complicated Chinese character keyboard interfaces, Hong Kong English speakers will text and email English translations to the point that the English word often gains independent usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/article/1825528/add-oil-evolution-hong-kong-english-and-where-our-unique|title=Add oil! The evolution of Hong Kong English, and where our unique words come from|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '[[Add oil]]': [add oil!] verb, literally to fuel, is used more as an idiom to encourage a team or person. The term has long been limited to the Cantonese "gaa jau!" ([[wikt:加油|加油]]), after originating as a cheer at the Macau Grand Prix in the 60s, but Hong Kong English speakers are increasingly using the English transliteration.
* 'Locust': [lo-cust] noun, referring to tourists from the mainland and meant to connote both masses and a drain on local resources. The word is derogatory and originated during shortages of powdered milk, which [[Anti-parallel trading protests|anti-parallel trading protesters]] blamed on mainland parallel traders.
* ''[[Light bulb]]'' (literal translation of "[[wikt:電燈泡|電燈膽]]") means a third person that spoils the ideal combination of a couple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.civicparty.hk/?q=node/6903|title=「二」話要說 |website=civicparty.hk|date=December 7, 2015}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "Do not be a light bulb" means "Do not play [[gooseberry]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/play-gooseberry|title=play gooseberry translate to Traditional Chinese|website=dictionary.cambridge.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common differences the Cantonese-speaking community==
* A 'body check' is used to refer to a medical checkup (medical examination), not a contact with an opponent from the front (due to literal translation from Chinese)
* "Outlook" is often (mis)understood as "appearance".  The noun "look" or "appearance" ("表") in Cantonese is commonly preceded by the character for "outer" ("外")
* Using "open" instead of "turn on" and "close" instead of "turn off" for electronics such as televisions and fans. This is because "open" and "turn on" both use the same character ("開") in Cantonese. In spoken Cantonese, closing the door("閂" for the action, "門" for the door) and turning off appliances("熄" for the action) is denoted differently. Nonetheless, in formal writing, the same character ("關") is commonly used for both.
* read "late-er" for later.
* read "surface" for service.
* read "pon-t" for point.

'''Horse meat'''  is the culinary name for meat cut from a [[horse]]. It is a major meat in only a few countries, notably in [[Central Asia]], but it forms a significant part of the culinary traditions of many others, from Europe to South America to Asia. The top eight countries consume about 4.7 million horses a year. For the majority of humanity's early existence, wild horses were hunted as a source of protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Because of the role horses have played as companions and as workers, and ensuing concerns about the [[ethics]] of the [[horse slaughter]] process, it is a [[taboo food]] in [[Horse meat#In various countries|some cultures]]. These historical associations, as well as ritual and [[Horse worship|religion]], led to the development of an aversion to the consumption of horse meat. The horse is now given [[Domestication of the horse|pet status]] by many in some parts of the [[Western world]], particularly in the United States, United Kingdom, and Ireland, which further solidifies the taboo on eating its meat.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==History==
In the [[Paleolithic]], [[wild horse]]s formed an important source of food. In many parts of Europe, the consumption of horse meat continued throughout the Middle Ages until modern times, despite a papal ban of horse meat in 732.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Pillsbury|title=No foreign food: the American diet in time and place|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8te03bzHJkUC|year=1998|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=978-0-8133-2739-6|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8te03bzHJkUC&amp;pg=PA14 14]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horse meat was also eaten as part of [[Germanic paganism|Germanic pagan]] religious ceremonies in [[northern Europe]], particularly ceremonies associated with the worship of [[Odin]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

The meat was, and still is, preserved by being [[dried meat|sun-dried]] in the high [[Andes]] into a product known as ''[[charqui]]''.

France dates its taste for horse meat to [[French Revolution|the Revolution]]. With the fall of the aristocracy, its auxiliaries had to find new means of subsistence. Just as hairdressers and tailors set themselves up to serve commoners, the horses maintained by aristocracy as a sign of prestige ended up alleviating the hunger of lower classes.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt; During the Napoleonic campaigns, the surgeon-in-chief of [[Napoleon]]'s [[Grand Army]], [[Baron Dominique-Jean Larrey]], advised the starving troops to eat the meat of horses. At the [[siege of Alexandria]], the meat of young [[Arab horse]]s relieved an epidemic of [[scurvy]]. At the [[battle of Eylau]] in 1807, Larrey served horse as soup and ''[[bœuf à la mode]]''. At [[battle of Aspern-Essling|Aspern-Essling]] (1809), cut off from the supply lines, the cavalry used the breastplates of fallen ''[[cuirassier]]s'' as cooking pans and [[gunpowder]] as seasoning, and thus founded a tradition that carried on until at least the Waterloo campaign.&lt;ref name="Musee"&gt;Larrey is quoted in French by Dr Béraud, ''[http://leslivresoublies.free.fr/leslivresoublies/Sciences_et_techniques_muse/cheval.html Études Hygiéniques de la chair de cheval comme aliment]'', ''[[Musée des Familles]]'' (1841-42).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Parker"&gt;Larrey mentions in his memoirs how he fed the wounded after the (1809) with [[bouillon]] of horse meat seasoned with gunpowder.

Horse meat gained widespread acceptance in [[French cuisine]] during the later years of the [[Second French Empire]]. The high cost of living in [[Paris]] prevented many working-class citizens from buying meat such as [[pork]] or [[beef]], so in 1866, the French government legalized the eating of horse meat, and the first butcher's shop specializing in horse meat opened in eastern Paris, providing quality meat at lower prices.&lt;ref&gt;Kari Weil, [http://caliber.ucpress.net/doi/abs/10.1525/gfc.2007.7.2.44 "They Eat Horses, Don't They?

Though there were large numbers of horses in Paris (estimates suggested between 65,000 and 70,000 were butchered and eaten during the siege) the supplies were ultimately limited. Not even champion racehorses were spared (two horses presented to [[Napoleon III]] by [[Alexander II of Russia]] were slaughtered) but the meat became scarce. Many Parisians gained a taste for horse meat during the siege, and after the war ended, horse meat remained popular. Likewise, in other places and times of siege or starvation, horses are viewed as a food source of last resort.

Despite the general [[Anglophone]] taboo, horse and donkey meat was eaten in Britain, especially in [[Yorkshire]], until the 1930s,&lt;ref&gt;''Eating Up Italy: Voyages on a Vespa'' by [[Matthew Fort]]. 2005, p253. {{ISBN|0-00-721481-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in times of postwar food shortage surged in popularity in the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Grutzner |first=Charles |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1946/09/25/archives/horse-meat-consumption-by-new-yorkers-is-rising-newark-dealer.html?sq=horse%2520meat&amp;scp=4&amp;st=cse |title=Horse Meat Consumption By New Yorkers Is Rising - Newark Dealer Reports 60% of Customers Are From City-Weinstein Will Not Prohibit Sale of the Flesh Here - Front Page - NYTimes.com |publisher=Select.nytimes.com |date=1946-09-25 |accessdate=2014-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was considered for use in hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Powers |first=James E. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1946/09/29/archives/nearby-hospitals-down-to-minimum-of-meat-supplies-westchester-just.html?sq=horse%2520meat&amp;scp=10&amp;st=cse |title=NEAR-BY HOSPITALS DOWN TO MINIMUM OF MEAT SUPPLIES - Westchester Just Getting By, Monmouth is Using HighProtein SubstitutesHENKEL SCORES TRUMAN Says Restaurants Can't Sell 'Patience' Any More-3 Seek to Deal in Horse Flesh Here - Front Page - NYTimes.com |publisher=Select.nytimes.com |date=1946-09-29 |accessdate=2014-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine article about horse meat brought in from Canada to the United States characterized the meat as sweet, rich, superlean, oddly soft meat, and closer to beef than [[venison]].&lt;ref name=Time2007-02-08 /&gt;

It is also taboo in Brazil, Israel, and among the [[Romani people]] and [[Jewish people]] the world over. Horse meat is not generally eaten in Spain, except in the north, although the country exports horses both live animals and slaughtered meat for the French and Italian markets. Horse meat is consumed in some North American and Latin American countries, and is illegal in some countries. For example, the Food Standards Code of Australia and New Zealand definition of 'meat' does not include horse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2012C00286/ |title=Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code 2.2.1 Meat and meat products |publisher=Comlaw.gov.au |date=2012-05-20 |accessdate=2013-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Tonga]], horse meat is eaten nationally, and Tongan emigrants living in the United States, New Zealand, and Australia have retained the taste for it, claiming Christian missionaries originally introduced it to them.&lt;ref&gt;Simoons, F.J., 1994, Eat not this Flesh, Food Avoidances from Pre-history to Present, University of Wisconsin Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Islamic law, consuming horse meat is [[Halal]]. The consumption of horse meat has been common in [[Central Asia]] societies, past or present, due to the abundance of [[steppes]] suitable for raising horses. In North Africa, horse meat has been occasionally consumed, but almost exclusively by the Christian [[Copts]] and the [[Hanafi]] Sunnis (a common form of Islam in Central Asia and Turkey), but has never been eaten in the [[Maghreb]].&lt;ref&gt;Françoise Aubaile-Sallenave, "Meat among Mediterranean Muslims: Beliefs and Praxis", ''Estudios del Hombre'' '''19''':129 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

Horse meat is forbidden by [[Kashrut|Jewish dietary laws]] because horses do not have [[cloven hoof|cloven hooves]] and they are not [[ruminants]].

In the eighth century, Popes [[Pope Gregory III|Gregory III]] and [[Pope Zachary|Zachary]] instructed [[Saint Boniface]], missionary to the Germans, to forbid the eating of horse meat to those he converted, due to its association with [[Germanic pagan]] ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;William Ian Miller, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1289363 "Of Outlaws, Christians, Horsemeat, and Writing: Uniform Laws and Saga Iceland"], ''Michigan Law Review'', Vol. 89, No. 8 (August 1991), pp. 2081-2095 {{subscription|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Calvin W.

The culturally close people of [[Sweden]] still have an ambivalent attitude to horse meat, said to stem from this time.

[[Henry Mayhew]] describes the difference in the acceptability and use of the horse carcass in London and Paris in ''[[London Labour and the London Poor]]'' (1851).&lt;ref&gt;vol 2 p 7-9&lt;/ref&gt; Horse meat was rejected by the British but continued to be eaten in other European countries such as France and Germany, where [[knackers]] often sold horse carcasses despite the papal ban. Even the hunting of wild horses for meat continued in the area of [[Westphalia]]. Londoners also suspected that horse meat was finding its way into sausages and that [[offal]] sold as that of oxen was in fact equine.

While no taboo on eating horse meat exists ''per se'', it is generally considered by ethnic Russians to be a low-quality meat with poor taste, and it is rarely found in stores.

It is popular among such peoples as [[Tatars]], [[Yakuts]], [[Kyrgyzs]], and [[Kazakhs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ofoods.ru/konina-vred-i-polza/|script-title=ru:Конина: вред и польза|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reasons for the taboo===
{{further|horse sacrifice}}
In 732 AD, Pope Gregory III began a concerted effort to stop the ritual consumption of horse meat in pagan practice. In some countries, the effects of this prohibition by the [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic Church]] have lingered, and horse meat prejudices have progressed from [[taboos]], to avoidance, to abhorrence.&lt;ref name=IGHA-USDA/&gt; In a study conducted by Fred Simoons, the avoidance to horse meat in American culture is less likely due to lingering feelings from Gregory's prohibition and instead due to an unfamiliarity with the meat compared to more mainstream offerings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=No Foreign Food: The American Diet in Time and Place|last=Pillsbury|first=Michael|publisher=Westview Press|year=1998|isbn=0-8133-2738-5|location=Boulder, Colorado|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other parts of the world, horse meat has the [[social stigma|stigma]] of being something poor people eat and is seen as a cheap substitute for other meats, such as pork and beef.

|postscript={{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; some cultures class horse meat as taboo because the horse converts grass into meat less efficiently than ruminants.

[[Totem]]istic taboo is also a possible reason for refusal to eat horse meat as an everyday food, but did not necessarily preclude ritual slaughter and consumption. [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] sources state that the goddess [[Epona]] was widely worshipped in [[Gaul]] and southern Britain. Epona, a triple-aspect goddess, was the protectress of the horse and horse keepers, and horses were sacrificed to her;&lt;ref&gt;Powell, T. G. E., 1958, The Celts, Thames and Hudson, London&lt;/ref&gt; she was paralleled by the [[Irish mythology|Irish]] [[Macha]] and [[Welsh mythology|Welsh]] [[Rhiannon]]. In ''[[The White Goddess]]'', Robert Graves argued that the taboo among Britons and their descendants was due to worship of Epona, and even earlier rites.&lt;ref&gt;Graves, Robert, ''The White Goddess'', Faber and Faber, London, 1961, p 384&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Uffington White Horse]] is probable evidence of ancient horse worship. The ancient Indian [[Kshatriya]]s engaged in horse sacrifice (Ashwamedh Yaghya) as recorded in the [[Vedas]] and [[Ramayana]]; but within context of the ritual sacrificial is not being 'killed' but instead being smothered to death.&lt;ref name="Campbell 1962"&gt;Campbell, Joseph, ''Oriental Mythology: The Masks of God'', Arkana, 1962, pp190-197 {{ISBN|0-14-019442-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913, the Finnic [[Mari people]] of the [[Volga]] region were observed to practice a horse sacrifice.&lt;ref name="Campbell 1962" /&gt;

In ancient Scandinavia, the horse was very important, as a living, [[working animal|working creature]], as a sign of the [[social status|owner's status]], and symbolically within the old [[Norse religion]]. Horses were slaughtered as a [[sacrifice]] to the gods, and the meat was eaten by the people taking part in the religious feasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Production==
[[File:Muenchen Pferdemetzger Viktualienmarkt.jpg|thumb|Horse butcher on the [[Viktualienmarkt]] in Munich, Germany]]
In most countries where horses are slaughtered for food, they are processed in a similar fashion to cattle, i.e., in large-scale factory [[slaughter house]]s (abattoirs) where they are [[stunning|stunned]] with a [[captive bolt gun]] and [[exsanguination|bled to death]]. In countries with a less industrialized food production system, horses and other animals are slaughtered individually outdoors as needed, in the village where they will be consumed, or near to it.&lt;ref&gt;C.J. Chivers, [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/26/international/asia/26horse.html?hp&amp;ex=1135659600&amp;en=ebc2553086dd95e4&amp;ei=5094&amp;partner=homepage A Sure Thing for Kazakhs: Horses Will Provide] The New York Times&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the eight principal horse meat-producing countries produced over 700,000 tonnes of this product.

In 2005, the five biggest horse meat-consuming countries were China (421,000 tonnes), Mexico, Russia, Italy, and Kazakhstan (54,000 tonnes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afac.ab.ca/reports/08horsereport.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319202824/http://www.afac.ab.ca/reports/08horsereport.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-19 |title=The Alberta Horse Welfare Report, 2008 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Mexico produced 140,000 tonnes, China - 126,000 tonnes, Kazakhstan - 114,000 tonnes.

As horses are relatively poor converters of grass and grain to meat compared to cattle,&lt;ref name=Harris /&gt; they are not usually bred or raised specifically for their meat. Instead, horses are slaughtered when their monetary value as [[equitation|riding]] or [[draft animal|work animals]] is low, but their owners can still make money selling them for horse meat, for example in the routine export of the [[south England|southern English]] ponies from the [[New Forest pony|New Forest]], [[Exmoor pony|Exmoor]], and [[Dartmoor pony|Dartmoor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/south/series2/new_forest_ponies_commoners_breed_improvements.shtml |title=BBC Inside Out - New Forest Ponies |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2003-02-24 |accessdate=2013-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=countrysideonline237&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061007150933/http://www.countrysideonline.co.uk/plugins/content/content.php?content.237|archivedate=2006-10-07|publisher=BBC Inside Out|title=NFU Countryside Online: Passports for Ponies|url=http://www.countrysideonline.co.uk/plugins/content/content.php?content.237|accessdate=2006-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[British law]] requires the use of "[[Horse passport|equine passports]]" even for semi [[wild horse]]s to enable [[traceability]] (also known as "provenance"), so most slaughtering is done in the UK before the meat is exported,&lt;ref name=countrysideonline237 /&gt; meaning that the animals travel as carcasses rather than live. Ex-racehorses, riding horses, and other horses sold at auction may also enter the [[food chain]]; sometimes these animals have been stolen or purchased under false pretenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netposse.com/stolenmissing/storyladyslaughter.htm |title=Slaughter of Lady |publisher=Netposse.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even prestigious horses may end up in the [[slaughterhouse]]; the 1986 [[Kentucky Derby]] winner and 1987 [[Eclipse Award for Horse of the Year]] winner, [[Ferdinand (horse)|Ferdinand]], is believed to have been slaughtered in Japan, probably for [[pet food]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://horsesdaily.com/news/racing/2003/07-21-derbywinner-ferdinand.html |title=Death of a Derby Winner |publisher=Horsesdaily.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A misconception exists that horses are commonly slaughtered for pet food. In many countries, such as the United States, horse meat was outlawed for use in pet food in the 1970s. American horse meat is considered a delicacy in Europe and Japan, and its cost is in line with veal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haras-nationaux.fr/portail/uploads/tx_vm19docsbase/DIP_ECO_03_HORSEMEAT_01.pdf |title=Horsemeat in France - (June 2006), Librairie des Haras nationaux |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; so it would be prohibitively expensive in many countries for pet food.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maff.go.jp/aqs/animal/pdf/risk_assesment_hiikuhorse_1.pdf] 70% of products derived from living horses that are destined to slaughter after being imported to Japan (at 2014) is meat, while pet food is 0,1%&lt;/ref&gt;

The British newspaper ''[[The Daily Mail]]'' reports that every year, 100,000 live horses are transported into and around the [[European Union]] for human consumption, mainly to Italy, but also to France and Belgium.&lt;ref name=DailyMailHorses&gt;{{cite news

Meat from horses that veterinarians have [[Animal euthanasia|put down]] with a lethal injection is not suitable for human consumption, as the toxin remains in the meat; the carcasses of such animals are sometimes [[cremation|cremated]] (most other means of disposal are problematic, due to the toxin).{{citation needed|date=March 2010}} Remains of euthanized animals can be [[Rendering (food processing)|rendered]], which maintains the value of the skin, bones, fats, etc., for such purposes as fish food. This is commonly done for lab specimens (e.g., pigs) euthanized by injection. The amount of drug (e.g. a barbiturate) is insignificant after rendering.{{citation needed|date=March 2010}}

Carcasses of horses treated with some drugs are considered edible in some jurisdictions. For example, according to Canadian regulation, [[hyaluronic acid|hyaluron]], used in treatment of particular disorders in horses, in HY-50 preparation, should not be administered to animals to be slaughtered for horse meat.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110607112840/http://www.drugs.com/vet/hy-50-can.html HY-50 for veterinary use] (archived from [https://www.drugs.com/vet/hy-50-can.html the original] on 2011-10-06).&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, however, the same preparation is not considered to have any such effect, and edibility of the horse meat is not affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genitrix.co.uk/2008ProductsHorses-HY502.php |title=Genitrix HY-50 Vet brochure |publisher=Genitrix.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080601040624/http://www.genitrix.co.uk/2008ProductsHorses-HY502.php |archivedate=June 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

French actress and [[animal rights]] activist [[Brigitte Bardot]] has spent years crusading against the eating of horse meat. However, the opposition is far from unanimous; a 2007 readers' poll in the London magazine ''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]]'' showed that 82% of respondents supported chef [[Gordon Ramsay]]'s decision to serve horse meat in his restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]]'' 30 May–5 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Paardenrookvlees.JPG|thumb|[[Smoking (cooking)|Smoked]] and salted horse meat on bread]]
Horse meat has a slightly sweet taste reminiscent of a combination of beef and [[venison]]. Meat from younger horses tends to be lighter in color, while older horses produce richer color and flavor, as with most [[mammals]]. Horse meat can be used to replace beef, pork, mutton, venison, and any other meat in virtually any recipe. Horse meat is usually very lean. Jurisdictions which allow for the slaughter of horses for food rarely have age restrictions, so many are quite old, some even as young as 16 to 24 months old. IHDH did find that horses at the age of 6 months had lower value of moisture, and protein. Horses who are killed have around 40 hour long journey to the slaughter house becoming deprived of starvation, thirst, and hypothermia. Causing the horses to be weak and unable to stand, walking out of the trailer."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=De Palo|first=P.|last2=Maggiolino|first2=A.|last3=Centoducati|first3=P.|last4=Tateo|first4=A.|date=November 2013|title=Slaughtering Age Effect on Carcass Traits and Meat Quality of Italian Heavy Draught Horse Foals|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4093806/|journal=Asian-Australasian Journal of Animal Sciences|volume=26|issue=11|pages=1637–1643|doi=10.5713/ajas.2013.13174|issn=1011-2367|pmc=4093806|pmid=25049752}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australians do not generally eat horse meat, although they have a horse slaughter industry that exports to Japan, Europe, and Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/143912568/Exporting-red-meat-to-Russia-Understanding-the-context |title=Exporting red meat to Russia: Understanding the context |publisher=Australian National Internships Program |date=7 October 2010 |accessdate=2013-02-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210051641/http://www.scribd.com/doc/143912568/Exporting-red-meat-to-Russia-Understanding-the-context |archive-date=10 December 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Horse meat exports peaked at 9,327 tons 1986, declining to 3,000 tons in 2003.

On 30 June 2010, Western Australian Agriculture Minister [[Terry Redman]] granted final approval to [[Western Australia]] butcher Vince Garreffa to sell horse meat for human consumption. Nedlands restaurateur Pierre Ichallalene announced plans to do a taster on [[Bastille Day]] and to put horse meat dishes on the menu if the reaction is good. Mr. Redman said that the government would "consider extending approvals should the public appetite for horse demand it".&lt;ref name=thewest7492421&gt;{{cite web|url=http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/-/latest/7492421/butcher-gives-horse-meat-a-run/ |title=Butcher gives horse meat a run |publisher=Au.news.yahoo.com |date=2010-07-01 |accessdate=2013-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mr. Garreffa is the owner of Mondo Di Carne, a major wholesale meat supplier which supplies many cafes, restaurants, and hotels in Western Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mondo.net.au/data/retail.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026030031/http://www.mondo.net.au/data/retail.html|date=October 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mondo.net.au/data/wholesale.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100130151420/http://www.mondo.net.au/data/wholesale.html|date=January 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He commented that no domestic market exists for horse meat, but a successful export market exists, of which he believes Western Australia should have a share.&lt;ref name=thewest7492421 /&gt;

This decision caused outrage amongst some groups, limited reaction from many, and enthusiasm from others. Several local newspaper forums indicated that the general public were not greatly biased either way, in fact many voiced their openness for alternative meats.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Horse meat consumption has continued as a niche market in Australia, with further potential for growth as gourmet interests develop.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

====China====
{{See also|Chinese cuisine}}
Although it is generally acceptable to Chinese people, outside of specific areas such as [[Guilin]] in [[Guangxi]] or in [[Yunnan|Yunnan Province]], horse meat is not popular due to its low availability and rumors that horse meat tastes bad or it is bad for health. Because ''the [[Compendium of Materia Medica]]'' written during the [[Ming dynasty]] by [[Li Shizhen]] indicates that horse meat is poisonous and may cause [[folliculitis]] or [[death]].&lt;ref name="bencao"&gt;[[Li Shizhen]], ''the [[Compendium of Materia Medica]]''(《{{lang|zh|本草綱目}}》) Chapter ''Shou'' Wild mammal one({{lang|zh|獸之一}}), Ming dynasty [https://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E6%9C%AC%E8%8D%89%E7%B6%B1%E7%9B%AE/%E7%8D%B8%E4%B9%8B%E4%B8%80#.E9.A6.AC]&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Compendium of Materia Medica'' also asserts, "To relieve toxin caused by eating horse meat, one can drink [[Phragmites]] root jouce and eat [[apricot kernel]]." Today, in southern China, locally famous dishes include horse meat [[rice noodles]] ({{Lang|zh|马肉米粉}}; Pinyin: ''mǎròu mǐfěn'') in Guilin and horse meat [[hot pot]] ({{Lang|zh|马肉火锅}}; Pinyin: ''mǎròu huǒguō'') in [[Huishui County]] in [[Guizhou]] Province.

[[File:Sakura nabe (3296782416).jpg|thumb|Sakura nabe]]
In [[Japanese cuisine]], raw horse meat is called {{Nihongo3||桜|sakura}} or {{Nihongo3|''sakura'' means [[cherry blossom]], ''niku'' means meat|桜肉|sakuraniku}} because of its pink color. It can be served raw as ''[[sashimi]]'' in thin slices dipped in soy sauce, often with ginger and onions added.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Metropolis (free magazine)|Metropolis]]'', "Straight From the Horse's Mouth", #903, 15 July 2011, pp. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, it is called {{Nihongo|'''''basashi'''''|馬刺し}}. ''Basashi'' is popular in some regions of Japan and is often served at ''[[izakaya]]'' bars. Fat, typically from the neck, is also found as ''basashi'', though it is white, not pink. Horse meat is also sometimes found on menus for ''[[yakiniku]]'' (a type of barbecue), where it is called {{Nihongo|''baniku''|馬肉||literally "horse meat"}} or {{Nihongo|''bagushi''|馬串||"skewered horse"}}; thin slices of raw horse meat are sometimes served wrapped in a [[perilla|shiso leaf]]. [[Kumamoto prefecture|Kumamoto]], [[Nagano Prefecture|Nagano]], and [[Ōita Prefecture|Ōita]] are famous for ''basashi'', and it is common in the [[Tōhoku region]], as well. Some types of canned "corned meat" in Japan include horse as one of the ingredients.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.puntofocal.gov.ar/notific_otros_miembros/jpn163_t.pdf Brief Overview of the Draft Revision of Quality Labeling Standard for Canned and Bottled Livestock Products], Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (from [http://www.puntofocal.gov.ar/ PuntoFocal Argentina]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moit.gov.il/NR/rdonlyres/AFFC01EB-9F99-4C1D-AA7F-6F52C1DD6155/0/Not0116JPN163.doc |title=NOTIFICATION, World Trade Organization, 16 January 2006 |date= |accessdate=2013-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Philippines====
In the [[Philippines]], horse meat (''lukba'', ''tapang kabayo'', or ''kabayo'') is a delicacy  commonly sold in wet markets. The method of preparation is very common which includes marinating the meat in ''[[calamansi]]'' or lemon juice, ''toyo'' (soy sauce), and ''[[patis (sauce)|patís]]'' (fish sauce). It is then fried and served, and often dipped into [[vinegar]] to give the meat a tart flavour.

====Tonga====
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2011}}
In [[Tonga]], horsemeat or ''lo'i ho'osi'' is much more than just a delicacy; the consumption of horsemeat is generally only reserved for special occasions. These special occasions may include the death of an important family member or community member or as a form of celebration during the birthday of an important family member or perhaps the visitation of someone important, such as the King of Tonga.

In Tonga, a horse is one of the most valuable animals a family can own because of its use as a beast of burden. Tonga has long lacked land area compared with its population so the missionaries introduced horsemeat in lieu of cattle. Therefore, the slaughter of one's horse for consumption becomes a moment of immense homage to the person or event for which the horse was slain. Despite a [[diaspora]] into Western countries such as Australia, the USA, and New Zealand, where consumption of horsemeat is generally taboo, Tongans still practice the consumption of horse meat perhaps even more so because it is more readily available and more affordable.

===Europe===
[[File:Big Hero steak.jpg|thumb|right|A horse meat steak served at restaurant Oklahoma, [[Vantaa]], [[Finland]]]]
In 2013, horse meat and traces of horse DNA were found in some food products where horse was not labelled as an ingredient, sparking the [[2013 meat adulteration scandal]] across Europe.

Horse ''[[Leberkäse]]'' is available in special horse [[butchery|butcheries]] and occasionally at various stands, sold in a bread roll. Dumplings can also be prepared with horse meat, spinach, or Tyrolean ''Graukäse'' (a sour milk cheese). They are occasionally eaten on their own, in a soup, or as a side dish.

====Belgium====
{{See also|Belgian cuisine}}
In Belgium, horse meat (''paardenvlees'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and ''viande chevaline'' in French) is popular in a number of preparations. Lean, smoked, and sliced horse meat fillet (''paardenrookvlees'' or ''paardengerookt''; ''filet chevalin'' in French) is served as a [[cold cut]] with sandwiches or as part of a cold salad. Horse steaks can be found in most butchers and are used in a variety of preparations. The city of [[Vilvoorde]] has a few restaurants specialising in dishes prepared with horse meat. Horse sausage is a well-known local specialty in [[Lokeren]] with European recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flanderstoday.eu/content/i-could-eat-horse |title=I could eat a horse |publisher=Flanders Today |date=2009-11-18 |accessdate=2013-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smoked or dried horse/pork meat sausage, similar to salami, is sold in a square shape to be distinguished from pork and/or beef sausages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

====Bulgaria====
{{See also|Bulgarian cuisine}}
Horse meat is served in some restaurants in Bulgaria, as the preferred way of consuming it is in the form of steaks and burgers. Still being far from a meat for mass consumption, horse beef is re-gaining its popularity, which it had in the 60s and 70s of the past century, when it was also consumed in sausages and tartares.

====France====

{{See also|French cuisine}}In France, specialized butcher shops (''boucheries chevalines'') sell horse meat, as ordinary butcher shops were for a long time forbidden to deal in it. However, since the 1990s, it can be found in supermarket butcher shops and others.

Horse meat was famously eaten in large amounts during the 1870 [[Siege of Paris (1870–1871)|Siege of Paris]], when it was included in ''[[haute cuisine]]'' menus.

====Germany====
{{See also|German cuisine}}
Although there is no taboo comparable to that in the English-speaking world, German law used to prescribe that horse meat be sold only by specialized butchers (''Pferdemetzgereien''). This prescription was abolished in 1993, but only a small minority of ordinary butchers have since begun to sell horse meat. Most horse meat is still sold by the specialists, some of whom also deliver by mail order.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pferd-und-fleisch.de/pferdeflsh/laden1.htm Pferd und Fleisch], information portal for German horse-meat customers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many regions of Germany have traditional recipes that include horse meat. In the [[Rhineland]] around Cologne and Düsseldorf, restaurants often offer the traditional ''[[Sauerbraten]]'' in horse meat, typically with a beef variant to choose from. Other traditional horse meat dishes include the [[Swabia]]n ''Pferderostbraten'' (a joint of roast meat prepared similarly to roast beef), [[Bavaria]]n sausage varieties such as ''Rosswurst'' and ''Ross-Kochsalami'' as well as ''Ross-Leberkäse'', a meatloaf dish.

The [[2013 meat adulteration scandal]] started when German authorities detected horse meat in prepared food products including frozen lasagna, where it was declared fraudulently as beef.  The mislabeling prompted EU authorities to speed up publication of European Commission recommendations for labeling the origin of all processed meat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/german-press-review-on-the-horsemeat-scandal-in-frozen-foods-a-883637.html German Press Review] Spiegel.de, Retrieved 04/17/2013&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hungary====
{{See also|Hungarian cuisine}}
In [[Hungary]], horse meat is primarily used in salami and sausages, usually mixed with pork, but also in goulashes and other stews. These products are sold in most supermarkets and many butcher shops.

====Iceland====
{{See also|Cuisine of Iceland}}
In Iceland, it is both eaten minced and as steak, also used in [[stew]]s and [[fondue]], prized for its strong flavor. It has a particular role in the culture and history of the island. The people of Iceland supposedly were reluctant to embrace Christianity for some time largely over the issue of giving up horse meat after [[Pope Gregory III]] banned horse meat consumption in 732 AD, as it was a major part of many pagan rites and sacrifice in Northern Europe. Horse meat consumption was banned when the pagan Norse [[Icelanders]] eventually [[Christianisation of Iceland#Adoption by arbitration|adopted Christianity]] in the year 1000. The ban became so ingrained that most people would not handle horse meat let alone consume it. Even during harsh famines in the 18th century most people would not eat horse meat, and those who did were castigated. In 1757 the ban was decriminalised, but general distaste for horse meat lasted well into the 19th century, possibly longer, and its consumption often regarded as an indication of poverty. Even today horse meat is not popular (3.2% of Iceland’s meat production in 2015), although this has more to do with culinary tradition and the popularity of equestrianism than any religious vestiges.

====Italy====
[[File:macelleria equina venezia.jpg|thumb|right|[[Venice|Venetian]] horse meat [[butcher]]]]
{{See also|Italian cuisine}}
Horse meat is especially popular in [[Lombardia]], [[Veneto]], [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]], [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]], [[Parma]], [[Apulia]], and the islands of [[Sardinia]] and [[Sicily]].

Horse meat is used in a variety of recipes: as a stew called ''pastissada'' (typical of [[Verona]]), served as steaks, as ''[[carpaccio]]'', or made into ''[[bresaola]]''. Thin strips of horse meat called ''sfilacci'' are popular. Horse fat is used in recipes such as ''[[b:Cookbook:Pezzetti di Cavallo|pezzetti di cavallo]]''. Horse meat sausages and salamis are traditional in various places. In Sardinia, ''sa petza 'e cuaddu'' or ''sa petha (d)e caddu'' (''[[campidanese]]'' and ''[[logudorese]]'' for horse meat) is one of the most renowned meats and sometimes is sold in typical kiosks with bread - also in the town of [[Sassari]] is a long tradition of eating horse steaks (''carri di cabaddu'' in the local dialect). Chefs and consumers tend to prize its uniqueness by serving it as rare as possible. [[Donkey]] is also cooked, for example as a stew called ''stracotto d'asino'' and as meat for sausages e.g. ''mortadella d'asino''. The [[Province of Parma#Cuisine|cuisine of Parma]] features a horsemeat ''[[tartare]]'' called ''pesto di cavallo'', as well as various cooked dishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jason McBride |url=http://blog.seattlepi.com/eatingweird/2009/07/03/heigh-ho-silver/ |title=Heigh ho, Silver - Eating Weird: Exploring Strange and Unusual Food in Seattle |publisher=Blog.seattlepi.com |date=2009-07-03 |accessdate=2014-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dolcideleddaintavola.blogspot.com/2011/03/pesto-di-cavallo.html |title=deledda's kitchen: pesto di cavallo |publisher=Dolcideleddaintavola.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Veneto]], the consumption of horse meat dates back to at least 1000 BC to the [[Adriatic Veneti]], renowned for their horse-breeding skills. They were used to sacrifice horses to their goddess [[Reitia]] or to the mythical hero [[Diomedes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=O7z4Sl-SgFEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Latin Language - Leonard Robert Palmer - Google Libri |publisher=Books.google.it |date= |accessdate=2014-02-09|isbn=9780806121369 |year=1988 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=hx7UigqsTKoC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=runic+amulets+and+magic+objects |title=Runic Amulets and Magic Objects - Mindy MacLeod, Bernard Mees - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.it |date= |accessdate=2014-02-09|isbn=9781843832058 |year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the classical period, Veneto established itself as a centre for horse breeding in Italy; Venetian horses were provided for the cavalry and carriage of the [[Roman legion]]s, with the white Venetic horses becoming famous among Greeks and Romans as one of the best breeds for [[circus]] racing.&lt;ref&gt;An early History of Horsemanship by Augusto Azzaroli. Brill 1985. p 135-138&lt;/ref&gt; As well as breeding horses for military and farming applications, the Venetics also used them for consumption throughout the Roman period, a practice that established the consumption of horse meat as a tradition in [[Venetian cuisine]]. In the modern age, horse meat is considered a luxury item and is widely available through supermarkets and butcheries, with some specialised butcheries offering only selected cuts of equine meat. Prices are usually higher than beef, pork, or any other kind of meat, except game.
[[File:Sfilacci di cavallo.jpg|thumb|right|Typical [[Paduan]] specialty: horse ''sfilacci'']]
In the Province of [[Padua]], horse meat is a key element of the local cuisine, particularly in the area that extends southeast from the city, historically called [[Saccisica]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turismopadova.it/menu-en/scoprire-padova/padova-da-gustare-1/itinerari-del-gusto/Enogastronomia%20cintura%20orientale%20e%20Saccisica?set_language=en&amp;cl=en Saccisica and Conselvano] Official site of the Padua Province. Tourist Section.&lt;/ref&gt; Specialties based on horse meat constitute the main courses and best attractions of several typical restaurants in the zone. They are also served among other regional delicacies at the food stands of many local festivals, related to civil and religious anniversaries. Most notable is the ''Festa del Cavallo'', held annually in the small town of [[Legnaro]] and totally dedicated to horses, included their consumption for food.

Some traditional dishes are:

*''Sfilacci di cavallo'': tiny frayings of horse meat, dried and seasoned; to be consumed raw, can be a light and quick snack, more popular as a topping on other dishes: ex. pasta, risotto, pizza, salads, etc. [[File:6232675-Horse meat stew Padova.jpg|thumb|Cavàeo in Umido (traditional horsemeat stew from [[Padua]]) with grilled polenta]]
*''Straéca'': a thin soft horse steak, cut from the diaphragm, variously cooked and dressed on the grill, pan or hot-plate
*''Bistecca di puledro'' colt steak, whose preparation is similar to ''straéca''
*''Spezzatino di cavallo'' also said ''cavàeo in umido'', small chunks of horse meat, stewed with onion, parsley and/or other herbs and flavours, potatoes, broth, wine, etc., usually consumed with [[polenta]], much appreciated also is a similar stew made of donkey meat, served in traditional [[trattoria|trattorie]], with many variations for different villages: ''spessadin de musso'', ''musso in umido'', ''musso in tocio'', ''musso in pocio''
*''Prosciutto di cavallo'': horse [[ham]], served in very thin slices
*''Salame di cavallo'' or ''salsiccia di cavallo'': various kinds of [[salami]], variously produced or seasoned, sometimes made of pure equine meat, sometimes mixed with others (beef or pork)
*''[[Bigoli]] al sugo di cavallo'': a typical form of fresh pasta, similar to thick rough spaghetti, dressed with sauce like [[Bolognese sauce]], but made with minced horse meat
*''Pezzetti di cavallo al sugo'': horse stew, seasoned with sauce, vegetables and various peperocino, widely used in the [[Salento]] [[File:Spezzatino di cavallo.jpg|thumb|right|Chunks (pezzetti) of horse stew (''spezzatino di cavallo'')]]

According to British food writer [[Matthew Fort]], "The taste for donkey and horse goes back to the days when these animals were part of everyday agricultural life. In the frugal, unsentimental manner of agricultural communities, all the animals were looked on as a source of protein. Waste was not an option."&lt;ref&gt;Eating Up Italy: Voyages on a Vespa by [[Matthew Fort]]. 2005, p253-254. {{ISBN|0-00-721481-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Norway, horse meat is commonly used in cured meats, such as ''vossakorv'' and ''svartpølse'', and less commonly as steak, ''hestebiff''.

In pre-Christian Norway, horse was seen as an expensive animal. To eat a horse was to show one had great wealth, and to sacrifice a horse to the gods was seen as the greatest gift one could give. When Norwegians adopted Christianity, horse-eating became taboo as it was a religious act for pagans, thus it was considered a sign of heresy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Jochens|first=Jenny |title=Women in Old Norse Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3h-lkgBWercC&amp;pg=PA87|year=1998|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-8520-6|pages=87–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horses in Poland are treated mostly as companions and the majority of society is against the live export to Italy.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} However, in Poland there exists a tradition of eating horse meat (sausage or tartare steaks). The consumption of horse meat was the biggest in the times when other meat was scarce (in the 20th century: WWII and the communist period).{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

====Serbia====
{{See also|Serbian cuisine}}
Horse meat is generally available in [[Serbia]], though mostly shunned in traditional cuisine. It is, however, often recommended by general practitioners to persons who suffer from [[anemia]]. It is available to buy at three green markets in [[Belgrade]], a market in [[Niš]], and in several cities in ethnically mixed [[Vojvodina]], where [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] and previously [[Germans|German]] traditions brought the usage.

====Slovenia====

[[File:Horse meat hamburger at restaurant Hot' Horse, Ljubljana, Slovenia.jpg|thumb|right|A horse meat hamburger in restaurant Hot' Horse, Ljubljana, Slovenia: Horse meat is a national delicacy in Slovenia.]]
Horse meat is generally available in [[Slovenia]], and is highly popular in the traditional cuisine, especially in the central region of [[Carniola]] and in the [[Karst Plateau|Karst]] region. Colt steak (''žrebičkov zrezek'') is also highly popular, especially in Slovenia's capital [[Ljubljana]], where it is part of the city's traditional regional cuisine. In Ljubljana, many restaurants sell burgers and meat that contain large amounts of horse meat, including a fast-food chain called Hot' Horse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ljubljana-life.com/eat/restaurants_details/96-Hot_Horse

====Spain====
{{See also|Spanish cuisine}}
[[Cecina (meat)|''Cecina'']] is cured meat made from beef or horse, and it is considered as a delicacy. [[Foal]] meat (''carne de potro'') is preferred rather than horse meat, and it is easy to find in supermarkets and usually prepared as stew or steak. It is a common practice to give it to children with anemia. Although no generalized taboo exists in Spain, its consumption is minor compared to pork, beef, and lamb.

====Sweden====
{{See also|Swedish cuisine}}
Smoked/cured horse meat is widely available as a [[cold cut]] under the name ''hamburgerkött'' (literally ''hamburgermeat''). It tends to be very thinly sliced and fairly salty, slightly reminiscent of deli-style ham and, as a packaged meat, may list horsemeat (as ''hästkött'') as its primary ingredient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rlklam.blogspot.com/2009/01/please-pass-horse.html|title=Please Pass the Horse|publisher=rlklam.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several varieties of smoked sausages made from horse meat including ''Gustafskorv''  are also quite popular, especially in the province of [[Dalarna]], where it is made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americulinariska.com/2014/10/20/gustafskorv-horse-meat/|title=A HORSE of Course! Horse Meat in Sweden (Gustafskorv)|date=October 20, 2014|publisher=americulinariska.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is similar to salami or ''[[metworst]]'' and is used as an alternative to them on sandwiches. It is also possible to order horse beef from some well-stocked grocery stores.

====Switzerland====
{{See also|Swiss cuisine}}
The ordinance on foodstuffs of animal origin in [[Switzerland]] explicitly lists [[equine]]s as an animal species allowed for the production of food.&lt;ref&gt;[[Federal Department of Home Affairs (Switzerland)|FDHA]] Ordinance of 23 November 2005 on food of animal origin, [http://www.admin.ch/ch/f/rs/817_022_108/a2.html Art.2].&lt;/ref&gt; Horse steak is modestly common. A speciality known as ''Mostbröckli'' is made with beef or horse meat. It is also used for a range of sausages in the German-speaking north of Switzerland. Like in northern Italy, in the Italian-speaking south, local ''salametti'' (sausages) are sometimes made with horse meat. It may also be used in [[Fondue#Fondue Bourguignonne|''fondue Bourguignonne'']].

====United Kingdom====
{{see also|British cuisine|2013 meat adulteration scandal}}
In the United Kingdom, the slaughter, preparation, and consumption of horses for food is not against the law, although it has been rare since the 1930s and it is not generally available. There is a cultural taboo against consuming horse meat in the UK, although it was eaten when other meats were scarce, such as during times of war&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/foodprogramme_20040425.shtml |title=BBC Radio 4 - Factual - Food Programme - 11 April 2004 |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2004-04-11 |accessdate=2013-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ww2peopleswar/stories/25/a7269825.shtml |title=WW2 People's War - Horsemeat, A Wedding Treat |publisher=BBC |date=2005-11-25 |accessdate=2013-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; (as was [[whale meat]], which was never popular in Britain). The sale of meat labelled as horse meat in supermarkets and butchers is minimal, and most of the properly described horse meat consumed in the UK is imported from Europe, predominantly the [[south of France]], where it is more widely available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/05/06/nramsay06.xml |title=We Should Eat Horse Meat|work=[[Daily Telegraph]] |date= |accessdate= |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horse meat may be eaten without the knowledge of the consumer, due to accidental or [[fraud]]ulent introduction of horse meat into human food. A 2003 [[Food Standards Agency]] (FSA) investigation revealed that certain sausages, salami and similar products such as [[chorizo]] and [[pastrami]] sometimes contain horse meat without it being listed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/2963554.stm |title=Horse meat found in salami |publisher=BBC News |date=June 4, 2003 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; although listing is legally required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.food.gov.uk/foodlabelling/ull/ |title=[ARCHIVED CONTENT&amp;#93; Food Standards Agency - Labelling rules |publisher=webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720141827/http://www.food.gov.uk/foodlabelling/ull/ |archivedate=2008-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2013 horse meat scandal]] involved multiple products being recalled from shelves due to unlabelled horse meat in amounts up to 100% of the meat content.&lt;ref name=bbcconf&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21375594 |title= Findus beef lasagne contained up to 100% horsemeat, FSA says |date=7 February 2013 |accessdate=7 February 2013|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue came to light on 15 January 2013, when it was reported that horse [[DNA]] had been discovered in frozen [[beefburger]]s sold in several Irish and British supermarkets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/9857136/Horse-meat-scandal-timeline.html|work=The Daily Telegraph|title=Horse meat scandal: timeline|accessdate=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horse meat was featured in a segment in a 2007 episode of the [[Gordon Ramsay]] series ''[[The F Word (TV series)|The F Word]]''. In the segment, [[Janet Street-Porter]] convinced locals to try horse meat, though not before facing controversy and being forced to move her stand to a privately owned location. The meat was presented as having a similar taste to beef, but with less fat, a high concentration of [[omega-3 fatty acid]] and a safer alternative in times of worry regarding [[Avian influenza|bird flu]] and [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|mad cow disease]]. The segment was met with skepticism from many after broadcast for various reasons, either because some felt the practice was cruel and against social norms, or simply a belief that if the taste was really on par with other meats, then people would already be eating it.&lt;ref name="thefword"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1550742/We-should-eat-horse-meat-says-Ramsay.html|title=We should eat horse meat, says Ramsay|first=David|last=Harrison|date=May 6, 2007|accessdate=July 24, 2016|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ukraine====
In Ukraine, especially in [[Crimea]] and other southern steppe regions, horse meat is consumed in the form of sausages called ''mahan'' and ''sudzhuk''. These particular sausages are traditional food of the [[Crimean Tatars|Crimean Tatar]] population.

===North America===

====Canada====
{{See also|Canadian cuisine}}
A thriving horse meat business exists in [[Quebec]]; the meat is available in most supermarket chains there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/food-and-wine/food-trends/why-you-should-eat-horsemeat-its-delicious/article567009/?page=all|title=Why you should eat horsemeat: It's delicious|date=January 4, 2011|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horse meat is also for sale at the other end of the country, in [[Granville Island]] Market in [[downtown Vancouver]], where according to a [[Time magazine|''Time'' magazine]] reviewer who smuggled it into the United States, it turned out to be a "sweet, rich, superlean, oddly soft meat, closer to beef than venison".&lt;ref name=Time2007-02-08&gt;{{cite news|last=Stein |first=Joel |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1587279,00.html |title=Horse — It's What's for Dinner|publisher=Time.com |date=2007-02-08 |accessdate=2013-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horse meat is also available in high-end [[Toronto]] butchers and supermarkets. Aside from the heritage of French cuisine at one end of the country, most of Canada shares the horse meat taboo with the rest of the [[English-speaking world]]. This mentality is especially evident in [[Alberta]], where strong [[horse racing]] and breeding industries and cultures have existed since the province's founding, although large numbers of horses are slaughtered for meat in Fort MacLeod,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tierschutzbund-zuerich.ch/en/investigation-reports/country/select_category/36.html |title=Investigation reports, Canada |publisher=Tierschutzbund Zürich TSB |location=Zurich, Switzerland |accessdate=2015-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and certain butchers in Calgary do sell it.

The consumer protection show ''Kassensturz'' of Swiss television [[Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen|SRF]] together with Tier Schutz Bund, Zürich, reported on 19 February 2013 the bad treatment and brutal animal husbandry in Canadian horse meat farms in Fort MacLeod, Alberta,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tierschutzbund-zuerich.ch/en/investigation-reports/details/article/canada-fort-macleod-slaughterhouse-bouvry-exports-and-feedlots-1.html |title=Canada, Fort Macleod, Slaughterhouse Bouvry Exports and Feedlots |date=17 October 2012 |publisher=Tierschutzbund Zürich TSB |location=Zurich, Switzerland |accessdate=2015-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.srf.ch/konsum/themen/konsum/quaelerei-auf-pferdefarmen |title=Quälerei auf Pferdefarmen |trans-title=Cruelty to horse farms |authors=Ursula Gabathuler, Samira Zingaro |publisher=Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen SRF |date=22 February 2013 |language=German |location=Zurich, Switzerland |accessdate=2015-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; consequently the import from such farms has been boycotted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.migros.ch/de/medien/medienmitteilungen/aktuelle-meldungen-2014/kein-pferdefleisch-vom-produzenten-bouvry.html |title=Migros bezieht kein Pferdefleisch mehr vom Produzenten Bouvry aus Kanada |language=German |publisher=Migros-Genossenschafts-Bund |location=Zurich, Switzerland |date=6 June 2014 |accessdate=2015-01-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150114212512/http://www.migros.ch/de/medien/medienmitteilungen/aktuelle-meldungen-2014/kein-pferdefleisch-vom-produzenten-bouvry.html |archivedate=14 January 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[CBC News]] reported on March 10, 2013, that horse meat was also popular among some segments of Toronto's population. &lt;!-- The article also reported that countries where horse meat is part of the diet include France, Russia, Kazakhstan, China, and Italy. --&gt;&lt;ref name=CBC2013-03-10&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/story/2013/03/10/toronto-horse-meat.html|title=Toronto restaurateurs say horse meat a prime dining choice|date=March 10, 2013|newspaper=[[CBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
{{See also|Horse slaughter#United States}}
Horse meat is generally not eaten in the United States and holds a taboo in American culture which is very similar to the one found in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodreference.com/html/arthorsemeat.html|title=Horsemeat - Food Facts and History - Food Reference|work=foodreference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; All horse meat produced in the United States (up until the last quarter of 2007) was intended solely for export abroad, primarily to the European Union. A thriving horse exportation business is going on in several states, including Texas, mainly exporting horses to slaughterhouses in either Canada or Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tierschutzbund-zuerich.ch/en/investigation-reports/country/select_category/37.html |title=Investigation reports, USA |publisher=Tierschutzbund Zürich (Animal Welfare Foundation) TSB |location=Zurich, Switzerland |accessdate=2015-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Restriction of human consumption of horse meat in the U.S. has generally involved legislation at local, state, and federal levels. Several states enacted legislation either prohibiting the sale of horse meat or banning altogether the slaughter of horses. &lt;!-- OUTDATED, as horse slaughter occurred until 2007 Texas, for example, banned in 1949 the sale of horsemeat, as well as the any trade operation, such as transportation, involving horse meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/AG/htm/AG.149.htm | title=Texas Agriculture Code Chapter 149 "Sale of Horsemeat for Human Consumption" | publisher=Texas Constitution and Statutes, State of Texas| year=1949 | accessdate=December 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;
[[California Proposition 6 (1998)]] was passed by state voters, outlawing the possession, transfer, reception, or holding any horse, pony, burro, or mule by a person who is aware that it will be used for human consumption, and making the slaughter of horses or the sale of horsemeat for human consumption a [[misdemeanor]] offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://vote98.sos.ca.gov/VoterGuide/Propositions/6.htm | title=Criminal Law. Prohibition on Slaughter of Horses and Sale of Horsemeat for Human Consumption. Initiative Statute. | publisher=California Secretary of State | year=1998 | accessdate=September 12, 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224023712/http://vote98.sos.ca.gov/VoterGuide/Propositions/6.htm | archivedate=February 24, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the Illinois General Assembly enacted Public Act 95-02, ameding Chapter 225, Section 635 of the state's compiled statutes &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=1381&amp;ChapterID=24| title=225 ILCS 635 "Illinois Horse Meat Act" | publisher=Illinois General Assembly| year=2007 | accessdate=December 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to prohibit both the act of slaughtering equines for human consumption as well as the trade of any horse meat similarly to Texas Agriculture Code's Chapter 149.

Other states banning horse slaughter or the sale of horse meat include New Jersey, Oklahoma,  and Mississippi. In addition, several other states introduced legislation to outlaw the practice over the years, such as Florida, Massachusetts, New Mexico, and New York.

At the federal level, since 2001 several bills have been regularly introduced in both the House and Senate to ban horse slaughter throughout the country without success. However, a budgetary provision banning the use of federal funds to carry out mandatory inspections at horse slaughter plants (necessary to allow interstate sale and exports of horse meat) has also been in place since 2007. This restriction was temporarily removed in 2011 as part of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2012 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; but was again included in the FY2014 Agriculture Appropriations Act and subsequent federal budgets, hence preventing the operation of any domestic horse slaughter operation.

Until 2007, only three horse meat slaughterhouses still existed in the United States for export to foreign markets, but they were closed by court orders resulting from the upholding of aforementioned Illinois and Texas statutes banning horse slaughter and the sale of horse meat.

The taboo surrounding horse meat in the United States received national attention again in May 2017 when a restaurant in the [[Lawrenceville (Pittsburgh)|Lawrenceville]] section of [[Pittsburgh]] served a dish containing [[Steak tartare|horse tartare]] as part of a special event the restaurant was hosting with [[French Canadian]] chefs as guests. The restaurant, which otherwise does not serve horse meat (which is legal to serve and consume in [[Pennsylvania]]), received an inspection and a warning from the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] not to serve horse meat again. A [[Change.org]] petition subsequently went up to advocate making serving horse meat illegal in Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;http://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2017/05/15/usda-warns-pittsburgh-restaurant-that-served-horse-meat/&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1920s and through the 1950s or 1960s, and with a brief rationing hiccup during WWII, horse meat was canned and sold as dog food by many different companies under many different brands, most notably by [[Ken-L Ration]]. The popularity of horse meat as dog food became so popular that by the 1930s over 50,000 horses were bred and slaughtered each year to keep up with this specific demand.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.neatorama.com/pet/2013/05/20/Kibble-Me-This-The-History-of-Dog-Food/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.animalfixer.com/articles/historydogfood.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Uncle-Johns-Unstoppable-Bathroom-Reader/dp/1592231160&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://thecatsite.com/threads/the-history-of-dog-food.89636/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lrgaf.org/slaughter/savin.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://rtfitchauthor.com/tag/ken-l-ration/&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mexico====
As of 2005, Mexico was the second largest producer of horse meat in the world.&lt;ref name=production2005 /&gt; By 2009, it became the largest producer of horse meat in the world.&lt;ref name=farminguk2009-01-17 /&gt; It is only exported as it is not used or consumed in Mexico.&lt;ref name="mexventa"&gt;[http://www.informador.com.mx/economia/2013/439909/6/mexico-consolida-venta-de-carne-de-caballo-al-exterior.htm "Mexico consolidates horse meat exportations" (in Spanish)] México consolida venta de carne de caballo al exterior. El Informador. Retrieved April 22, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===South America===

====Chile====
{{See also|Chilean cuisine}}
In [[Chile]], it is used in ''[[charqui]]''. Also in Chile, horse meat became the main source of nutrition for the nomadic indigenous tribes, which promptly switched from a [[guanaco]]-based economy to a horse-based one after the horses brought by the Spaniards bred naturally and became feral. This applied specially to the [[Pampa]] and [[Mapuche]] nations, who became fierce horseman warriors. Similar to the [[Tatars]], they ate raw horse meat and milked their animals.

Although not nearly as common as beef meat, horse meat can be readily available in some butcheries throughout the country. It is generally less expensive than beef and somewhat associated with lower social strata.

====Argentina====
[[Argentina]] is a producer and exporter of horse meat, but it is not used in local consumption and is considered taboo.&lt;ref name="lanacion1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1370512-carne-de-caballo-el-negocio-tabu-que-florece-en-la-argentina/ |title=Carne de caballo, el negocio tabú que florece en la Argentina|language=Spanish|work= La Nación |date= |accessdate=2013-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Sundaram Balachander]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://twitzindia.co/Vintage/vintage01.php?id=2|title=Jupiter Pictures is an Off - Shoot from the Pioneer in Tamil Film|date=19 November 2014|accessdate=2016-06-19|publisher=twitzindia}}&lt;/ref&gt; made a grand reentry in cinema with ''Idhu Nijama'' in 1948/K. G. Productions. The film based on the English classic ''[[Wonder Man (film)|Wonder Man]]'' in 1945, produced by [[Samuel Goldwyn]]. Wonder Man had [[Arthur Sheekman]]'s story reworked to a riveting screenplay by Jack Jevne and Eddie Moran, and directed by [[H. Bruce Humberstone]]. ''[[Wonder Man (film)|Wonder Man]]'' had [[Danny Kaye]] playing the dual role of Edwin Dingle and his twin Buzzy Bellew. ''Idhu Nijama'' was financed by S. Soundararajan Ayyengar and directed by Krishna Gopal, who was acclaimed as a technical wizard those days. [[Sundaram Balachander]] watched the movie repeatedly and observed all the finer points of the film. He came up with a brilliant screenplay suitable for an Indian milieu. The set of [[London]] [[City]] such as the famous [[Westminster Bridge]] was so realistically designed and impressively photographed (Krishna Gopal) that many movie goers thought the sequence was shot on location in [[England]]. The film was shot at the famous ''Ranjit Studio'' in [[Bombay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tfmdhool.com/sotd2/763.html|title=Song of the Day|accessdate=2016-06-21|publisher=tfmcool|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701052903/http://tfmdhool.com/sotd2/763.html|archivedate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Gopal spells the word ''Ma'', who enters the body of Gopal and how Gopal goes about avenging the murder of Madhu fills the rest of reels. Kumari Rajam played Madhu's pair while Sarojini played Gopal's sweetheart.&lt;ref name="thehindu"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4191">The '''International Society of Developmental Biologists''', or '''ISDB''', formerly the '''Institut Internationale d'Embryologie''' ('''IIE'''), is a non-profit scientific association promoting [[developmental biology]].  The society holds an international Congress every four years, and awards the most prestigious award in the field of developmental biology—the [[Ross Harrison Prize]].&lt;ref name="aboutisdb"&gt;[http://www.developmental-biology.org/about/about.html "About the ISDB"], International Society of Developmental Biologists.&lt;/ref&gt;

The institute was founded as by [[A. A. W. Hubrecht]] in 1911 as "a selective society of embryologists who would meet and discuss aspects of comparative embryology".&lt;ref name="noel"&gt;Emily Noël, [http://thenode.biologists.com/the-rebirth-of-the-dsdb/ "The (re)birth of the DSDB"], TheNode.Biologists.com, Feb. 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  After Hubrecht's death in 1915, the first director was [[Daniel de Lange]];&lt;ref name="noel" /&gt; other former presidents have included [[Etienne Wolf]], [[Lauri Saxén]] (1973–77),&lt;ref&gt;Eero Lehtonen, "Inductive Tissue Interactions: An Interview with Chancellor Lauri Saxén"], ''Int. J. Dev. Biol.'', v.43, pp.371-376 (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward M.

The IIE, based out of the [[Hubrecht Institute]] (aka "Hubrecht Laboratories) in the Netherlands, changed its name in 1968 to the International Society of Developmental Biologists (ISDB).&lt;ref name="noel" /&gt;  In 1997 the ISDB took over the functions of a parallel organization, the European Developmental Biology Organisation (EDBO), becoming the world umbrella of developmental biology associations.&lt;ref name="noel" /&gt;  Numerous national societies are currently members of the ISDB, including the [[Society for Developmental Biology]], the Asia-Pacific Developmental Biology Network, the Australia and New Zealand Society for Cell and Developmental Biology,  the British Society of Developmental Biologists, the Finnish Society for Developmental Biology, the French Developmental Biology Society,  the German Society of Developmental Biology, the Hong Kong Society for Developmental Biology, the Israel Society for Developmental Biology, the Italian Embryology Group, the Japanese Society for Developmental Biology, the Latin American Society for Developmental Biology, the Portuguese Society for Developmental Biology, and the Spanish Developmental Biology Society.&lt;ref name="aboutisdb" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5686">'''Jacaranda Music''' is a non-profit organization founded by impresario Patrick Scott and conductor/organist Mark Alan Hilt. Jacaranda produces an annual classical music concert series, mostly of modern music and works written since 2000 as well as rare older classical music with potential interest for contemporary listeners. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jacarandamusic.org/program-history/ |title=Program History|publisher=Jacaranda |access-date=September 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jacaranda has been based in [[Santa Monica]], California since 2003. In 2016, the series was named by ''[[L.A. Weekly]]'' as the Best Contemporary Classical Series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Payne |first1=John |title=Best Contemporary Classical Series |url=https://www.laweekly.com/best-of/2016/music-and-nightlife/best-rapper-7407206 |website=Best of L.A. |publisher=L.A. Weekly |accessdate=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Throughout its 16 seasons, Jacaranda has presented the compositions of [[Philip Glass]], [[John Cage]], [[Olivier Messiaen]], [[Gustav Mahler]], [[Lou Harrison]], [[Dylan Mattingly]], [[Mark Grey]], [[Florence Price]], [[Lukas Foss]], [[Julius Eastman]], [[Frederic Rzewski]], [[David Lang (composer)|David Lang]], [[Peter Maxwell Davies]], [[Horatiu Radulescu]], [[Franz Liszt]] and [[George Enescu]], among many others. Musicians have included [[Grammy]] and [[Emmy]] winner [[Gloria Cheng]], [[Anonymous 4]], Quatuor Diotima, Scott Dunn, [[Kathleen Supové]], [[Christopher Taylor (pianist)|Christopher Taylor]], and [[Billy Childs]].
Jacaranda's concerts have been reviewed by several publications, including the [[LA Times]], [[Classical Voice North America]], and [[BBC Music Magazine]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jacarandamusic.org/news/ |title=News|publisher=Jacaranda |access-date=September 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, The ''San Francisco Classical Voice'' said of Jacaranda: "To actually curate a concert is an art. It is one of the qualities that sets apart the Los Angeles music series Jacaranda. For more than 10 years… Jacaranda's concerts have been conceived as musical journeys of discovery…."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Farber |first1=Jim |title=A Flock of Oiseaux exotiques Reveals Jacaranda's Charms |url=https://www.sfcv.org/reviews/jacaranda/a-flock-of-oiseaux-exotiques-reveals-jacarandas-charms |website=San Francisco Classical Voice |publisher=San Francisco Classical Voice |accessdate=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[LA Times]]'' has said of Jacaranda that it "is known for imaginative programs of challenging contemporary music."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Schultz |first1=Rick |title=15 ways to hear chamber music magic in L.A. this spring |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-ca-cm-spring-preview-chamber-20180325-htmlstory.html |website=Los Angeles Times |publisher=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Los Angeles Times'' music critic Mark Swed said of Jacaranda in 2013, "With demanding pieces by [[Péter Eötvös|Eötvös]] and the famed late Hungarian composer [[György Ligeti]], "Fierce Beauty" was the most ambitious undertaking so far and by far for Jacaranda.…With this concert, Jacaranda grew up, moving beyond local to national significance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Swed |first1=Mark |title=Review: Jacaranda gives an important concert featuring Peter Eotvos |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jan/14/entertainment/la-et-cm-jacaranda-etvs-review-20130114 |website=Los Angeles Times |publisher=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The former dean of American music critics [[Alan Rich]] regularly wrote about Jacaranda, saying that they produce, "a kind of personalized programming so that you leave each event with the sense of having visited some very smart programming."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rich |first1=Alan |title=DUTCH TREAT: SPHERES AND COOKIES |url=http://www.soiveheard.com/ |website=So I've Heard |publisher=Alan Rich |accessdate=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2011, the Lyris Quartet has been its resident ensemble.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25902">'''Lifelong learning''' is the "ongoing, voluntary, and self-motivated"&lt;ref name="eric"&gt;Department of Education and Science (2000).  [http://eric.ed.gov/PDFS/ED471201.pdf Learning for Life:   Paper on Adult Education].  Dublin:  Stationery Office.&lt;/ref&gt; pursuit of knowledge for either personal or professional reasons. Therefore, it not only enhances social inclusion, [[active citizenship]], and personal development, but also self-sustainability, as well as competitiveness and employability.&lt;ref name="eurlex"&gt;Commission of the European Communities: "[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:52006DC0614 Adult learning: It is never too late to learn]". COM(2006) 614 final. Brussels, 23.10.2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolved from the term "life-long learners", created by Leslie Watkins and used by Professor Clint Taylor (CSULA) and [[Superintendent (education)|Superintendent]] for the Temple City Unified School District's mission statement in 1993, the term recognizes that learning is not confined to childhood or the classroom but takes place throughout life and in a range of situations. [[Allen Tough]] (1979), Canadian educator and researcher, asserts that almost 70% of learning projects are self-planned.&lt;ref&gt;The Adult's Learning Projects, A Fresh Approach to Theory and Practice in Adult Learning p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

During the last fifty years, constant scientific and technological innovation and change has had profound effects on how learning is understood. Learning can no longer be divided into a place and time to acquire knowledge (school) and a place and time to apply the knowledge acquired (the workplace).&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Gerhard (2000). "Lifelong Learning - More than Training" in ''Journal of Interactive Learning Research'', Volume 11 issue 3/4 pp 265–294.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, learning can be seen as something that takes place on an ongoing basis from our daily interactions with others and with the world around us. It can create and shapeshift into the form of [[formal learning]] or [[informal learning]], or self-directed learning.

== Links to theory ==
Two theories of particular relevance when considering lifelong learning are [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]] and constructivism.  Cognitivism, most notably [[Gestalt theory]], speaks of learning as making sense of the relationship between what is old and what is new.  Similarly, Constructivist theory states that "knowledge is not passively received from the world or from authoritative sources but constructed by individuals or groups making sense of their experiential worlds".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yilmaz|first1=Kaya|title=Constructivism: Its Theoretical Underpinnings, Variations, and Implications for Classroom Instruction|journal=Educational Horizons|date=2008|volume=86|issue=3|pages=161-172|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ798521}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Constructivism (philosophy of education)|Constructivism]] lends itself well to Lifelong learning as it brings together learning from many different sources including life experiences.

== Learning economy ==

Lifelong learning is being recognized by traditional colleges and universities as valid in addition to degree attainment. Some learning is accomplished in segments or interest categories and can still be valuable to the individual and community. The economic impact of educational institutions at all levels will remain significant as individuals continue formal studies and pursue interest-based subjects. Institutions produce educated citizens who buy goods and services in the community and the education facilities and personnel generate economic activity during the operations and institutional activities.  Similar to health facilities, educational institutions are among the top employers in many cities and towns of the world. Whether [[brick-and-mortar]] or [[distance education]] institutions, there is a great economic impact worldwide from learning, including lifelong learning, for all age groups. The lifelong learners, including persons with academic or professional credentials, tend to find higher-paying occupations, leaving monetary, cultural, and entrepreneurial impressions on communities, according to educator Cassandra B. Whyte.&lt;ref&gt;Whyte, Cassandra B/ (2002). "Great Expectations for Higher Education". Speech at Higher Education Round Table Event. Oxford, England.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whyte, Cassandra B. (1989) "Student Affairs-The Future". Journal of College Student Personnel. 30.(1) 86-89.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contexts ==

Although the term is widely used in a variety of contexts, its meaning is often unclear.&lt;ref&gt;Aspin, David N. &amp; Chapman, Judith D. (2007) "Lifelong Learning Concepts and Conceptions" in: David N. Aspin, ed.: ''Philosophical Perspectives on Lifelong Learning'', Springer. {{ISBN|1-4020-6192-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; A learning approach that can be used to define lifelong learning is [[heutagogy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Blaschke|first=Lisa Marie|title=Heutagogy and Lifelong Learning: A Review of Heutagogical Practice and Self-Determined Learning|url=http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/1076/2087|work=The International Review of Research in Open and Distance Learning|publisher=Athabasca University|accessdate=24 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several established contexts for lifelong learning beyond traditional "brick and mortar" schooling:
*[[Home schooling]] involves learning to learn or the development of informal learning patterns
*[[Adult education]] or the acquisition of formal qualifications or work and leisure skills later in life
*[[Continuing education]] which often describes extension or not-for-credit courses offered by [[higher education]] institutions
*[[Knowledge work]], which includes professional development and on-the-job training
*[[Personal learning environments]] or self-directed learning using a range of sources and tools including online applications
E-learning is available at most colleges and universities or to individuals learning independently. There are even online courses being offered for free by many institutions.

One new (2008 and beyond) expression of lifelong learning is the [[MOOC|massive open online course]] (a MOOC), in which a teacher or team offers a syllabus and some direction for the participation of hundreds, sometimes thousands, of learners. Most MOOCs do not offer typical "credit" for courses taken, which is why they are interesting and useful examples of lifelong learning.

== Emerging technologies ==

Lifelong learning is defined as "all learning activity undertaken throughout life, with the aim of improving knowledge, skills and competences within a personal, civic, social and/or employment-related perspective".&lt;ref&gt;Commission of the European Communities. (2001, November 21). Making a European Area of Lifelong Learning a Reality. Retrieved from EUR-Lex: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2001:0678:FIN:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt; It is often considered learning that occurs after the formal education years of childhood (where learning is instructor-driven—pedagogical) and into adulthood (where the learning is individually-driven—andragogical). It is sought out naturally through life experiences as the learner seeks to gain knowledge for professional or personal reasons.'Knowledge results from the combination of grasping experience and transforming it' (Kolb 1984: 41). 
The concept of lifelong learning has become of vital importance with the emergence of new technologies that change how we receive and gather information, collaborate with others, and communicate.

===Assistive technology===

As technology rapidly changes, individuals must adapt and learn to meet everyday demands.  However, throughout life, an individual's functional capacities may also change.  [[Assistive technology|Assistive technologies]] are also important considerations under the umbrella of emerging technology and lifelong learning.   Access to informal and formal learning opportunities for individuals with disabilities may be dependent upon low and high tech assistive technology.
 
===Web 2.0===

The emergence of [[Web 2.0]] technologies has great potential to support lifelong learning endeavors, allowing for informal, just-in-time, day-to-day learning.&lt;ref&gt;Dunlap, J. C., &amp; Lowenthal, P. R. (in press). Learning, unlearning, and relearning: Using Web 2.0 technologies to support the development of lifelong learning skills. In G. D. Magoulas (Ed.), E-infrastructures and technologies for lifelong learning: Next generation environments. Hershey, PA: IGI Global.&lt;/ref&gt; Constant change is emerging as the new normal. To thrive, organizations and individuals must be able to adjust, and enhance their knowledge and skills to meet evolving needs. This means the most important thing someone can learn is how to learn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.facultyfocus.com/seminars/web-2-0-tools-for-lifelong-learning-in-online-courses/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-10-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114041430/http://www.facultyfocus.com/seminars/web-2-0-tools-for-lifelong-learning-in-online-courses/ |archive-date=2013-11-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An understanding of web 2.0 tools is critical to keeping up with a changing world and the information explosion.

===Workplace learning===

Professions typically recognize the importance of developing practitioners becoming lifelong learners.  Nowadays, formal training is only a beginning. Knowledge accumulates at such a fast rate that one must continue to learn to be effective (Williams, 2001). Many licensed professions mandate that their members continue learning to maintain a license.  (Merriam, Caffarella, &amp; Baumgartner, 2007).&lt;ref name="Merriam, S. B. 2007"&gt;Merriam, S. B. &amp; Caffarella, R.S. (2007) Learning in adulthood:  A comprehensive guide.  San Francisco:  Josseey-Bass (3rd. Edition)&lt;/ref&gt; Having said this, what are the characteristics or skills that a lifelong learner must develop.  Reflective learning and critical thinking can help a learner to become more self-reliant through learning how to learn, thus making them better able to direct, manage, and control their own learning process (Candy, 1990).&lt;ref&gt;Mackeracher, D. (2004).  Making Sense of Adult Learning, Second Edition. Toronto:  University of Toronto Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Sipe (1995) studied experimentally "open" teachers and found that they valued self-directed learning, collaboration, reflection, and challenge; risk taking in their learning was seen as an opportunity, not a threat.  Dunlap and Grabinger (2003) say that for higher education students to be lifelong learners, they must develop a capacity for self-direction, metacognition awareness, and a disposition toward learning (Merriam, Caffarella, &amp; Baumgartner, 2007).&lt;ref name="Merriam, S. B. 2007"/&gt;

== Metacognition ==
While the study of [[metacognition]] originally gave [[Educational psychology|educational psychologists]] insights into what differentiated successful students from their less successful peers, it is increasingly being used to inform teaching that aims to make students more aware of their learning processes, and show them how to regulate those processes for more effective learning throughout their lives.&lt;ref name="gse.buffalo.edu"&gt;Livingston, Jennifer A. (1997) Metacognition: An Overview http://www.gse.buffalo.edu/fas/shuell/CEP564/Metacog.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Educators can employ Cognitive Strategy Instruction (CSI)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cehs.unl.edu/csi/self.shtml |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-10-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321014440/http://cehs.unl.edu/csi/self.shtml |archive-date=2012-03-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eadulteducation.org/resources-tools/instructor-resources/instructional-strategies-for-cognitive-strategy-instruction/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-10-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130320034222/http://www.eadulteducation.org/resources-tools/instructor-resources/instructional-strategies-for-cognitive-strategy-instruction/ |archive-date=2013-03-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a means to help learners develop their metacognition. Again, learners who are better equipped to create learning strategies for themselves will have more success in achieving their cognitive goals.&lt;ref name="gse.buffalo.edu"/&gt;

As lifelong learning is "lifelong, lifewide, voluntary, and self-motivated"&lt;ref name="eric"/&gt; learning to learn, that is, learning how to recognize learning strategies, and monitor and evaluate learning, is a pre-condition for lifelong learning. Metacognition is an essential first step in developing lifelong learning.

== Delors Report and the four pillars of learning ==
{{Main article|Delors Report}}

The Delors Report&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 1996. Learning: The Treasure Within. Report of the International Commission on Education for the 21st Century. Paris, UNESCO.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; proposed an integrated vision of education based on two key paradigms: lifelong learning and the four pillars of learning. The report proposed a holistic conceptual framework of learning, that of the 'four pillars of learning'. It argued that&amp;nbsp;formal education tends to emphasize the acquisition of knowledge to the detriment of other types of learning essential to sustaining human development. It stressed the need to think of learning over the life course, and to address how everyone can develop relevant skills, knowledge and attitudes for work, citizenship and personal fulfillment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002428/242887e.pdf|title=Level-setting and recognition of learning outcomes: The use of level descriptors in the twenty-first century|last=Keevy|first=James|last2=Chakroun|first2=Borhene|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100138-3|location=|pages=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four pillars of learning are:
# Learning to know
# Learning to do
# Learning to be
# Learning to live together
It is important to note that the four pillars of learning were envisaged against the backdrop of the notion of 'lifelong learning', itself an adaptation of the concept of 'lifelong education' as initially conceptualized in the 1972 Faure publication ''Learning to Be''.&lt;ref&gt;Tawil, S. and Cougoureux, M. 2013. Revisiting learning: the treasure within. Assessing the in uence of the 1996 Delors report. Education Research and Foresight Occasional Paper no. 4, January. Paris, UNESCO.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==In practice==
{{Primary sources|section|date=August 2017}}

In India and elsewhere, the "[[University of the Third Age]]" (U3A) provides an example of the almost spontaneous emergence of autonomous learning groups accessing the expertise of their own members in the pursuit of knowledge and shared experience. No prior qualifications and no subsequent certificates feature in this approach to learning for its own sake and, as participants testify, engagement in this type of learning in later life can indeed 'prolong active life'.

In Sweden the successful concept of [[study circles]], an idea launched almost a century ago, still represents a large portion of the adult education provision. The concept has since spread, and for instance, is a common practice in Finland as well. A study circle is one of the most democratic forms of a learning environment that has been created. There are no teachers and the group decides on what content will be covered, scope will be used, as well as a delivery method.

Sometimes lifelong learning aims to provide educational opportunities outside standard educational systems—which can be cost-prohibitive, if available at all. On the other hand, formal administrative units devoted to this discipline exist in a number of [[University|universities]]. For example, the 'Academy of Lifelong Learning' is an administrative unit within the University-wide 'Professional and Continuing Studies' unit at the [[University of Delaware]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| year = 2006
| url = http://www.academy.udel.edu/| title = Academy of Lifelong Learning
| publisher = University of Delaware
| accessdate = 2006-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the Jagiellonian University Extension (Wszechnica Uniwersytetu Jagiellonskiego), which is one of the most comprehensive Polish centers for lifelong learning (open learning, organizational learning, community learning).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| year = 2007
| url = http://www.wszechnica.uj.edu.pl/| title = Wszechnica Uniwersytetu Jagiellonskiego
| publisher = The Jagiellonian University
| accessdate = 2007-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, 'lifelong learning' has been adopted in the UK as an umbrella term for post-compulsory education that falls outside of the UK higher education system – [[further education]], [[community education]], [[work-based learning]] and similar voluntary, public sector and commercial settings.

Most colleges and universities in the United States encourage lifelong learning to non-traditional students.  Professional licensure and certification courses are also offered at many universities, for instance for teachers, social services providers, and other professionals. Some colleges even enable adults to earn credit for the college-level learning gained through work, volunteer and other experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.easternct.edu/ce/cll/|title=Credit for Lifelong Learning (CLL)|date=30 April 2014|publisher=|accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bangladesh Open University (BOU) has six schools and is offering 23 formal and 19 nonformal programs.&lt;ref name="BOU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bou.edu.bd/|title=Bangladesh Open University - Home|first=Super|last=User|website=www.bou.edu.bd|accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of enrolled students in formal programs for 2016 was 433,413.&lt;ref name="BOU"/&gt; Most of the courses of BOU are for professional development and most of the students are professional people who are getting scope to study in flexible hours.&lt;ref name="BOU"/&gt; BOU is the only public institution in the country that imparts education in distance mode.&lt;ref name="BOU"/&gt; In place of campus based teaching, this university uses technology including electronic devices to reach people in different corners of the country.&lt;ref name="BOU"/&gt;

In Canada, the federal government's Lifelong Learning Plan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/ndvdls/tpcs/rrsp-reer/llp-reep/menu-eng.html|title=Lifelong Learning Plan (LLP) - Canada.ca|first=Canada Revenue|last=Agency|website=www.cra-arc.gc.ca|accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; allows Canadian residents to withdraw funds from their [[Registered Retirement Savings Plan]] to help pay for lifelong learning, but the funds can only be used for formal learning programs at designated educational institutions.

Priorities for lifelong and life-wide learning have different priorities in different countries, some placing more emphasis on economic development (towards a [[learning economy]]) and some on social development (towards a learning society). For example, the policies of [[China]], [[South Korea|Republic of Korea]], [[Singapore]] and [[Malaysia]] promote lifelong learning in a [[human resource development]] (HRD) perspective. The governments of these countries have done much to foster HRD whilst encouraging entrepreneurship.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002330/233030e.pdf|title=Unleashing the Potential: Transforming Technical and Vocational Education and Training|last=Marope|first=P.T.M|last2=Chakroun|first2=B.|last3=Holmes|first3=K.P.|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100091-1|location=|pages=119–120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact on long-term economic growth ==
Mainstream economic analysis has highlighted increased levels of primary and secondary education as a key driver of long-term economic growth. Data show that initial levels of educational attainment explain about half the difference in growth rates between East Asia and sub- Saharan Africa between 1965 and 2010. At the individual level, the knowledge and skills workers acquire through education and training make them more productive. Provision of good quality education can improve the knowledge and skills of a whole population beyond what traditional or informal systems can achieve. For business, educated and highly skilled workers foster productivity gains and technological change, through either innovation or imitation of processes developed elsewhere. At the societal level, education expansion helps build social and institutional capital, which has a strong impact on the investment climate and growth; it also helps in building social trust, developing participatory societies, strengthening the rule of law and supporting good governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002469/246918e.pdf|title=Partnering for prosperity: education for green and inclusive growth; Global education monitoring report, 2016; summary|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implications for an aging society ==
According to the Alzheimer's Society, it is estimated that more than a million Canadians will suffer from Alzheimer's diseases by 2030. "Exercising the brain may preserve it, forestalling mental decline" (Grady, 2012).
In North America—and presumably globally—to proactively curb potential economic issues as the baby boomers continue to age, we need to look at society through a lifelong learning lens.  Consider community programs to engage retirees and foster their cognitive health. Taking a proactive approach to keep our elderly population engaged through learning and their brains exercised as Grady described, the strain on the health care system and not to mention the families of the elderly would be lessened. The US Department of Health and Human Service published a study that suggests that older people with a mild cognitive impairment receive 8.5 hours more of care each week from their family and those with a severe impairment received 41.5 more hours than those without a cognitive impairment (USDHHS, 2007).  Who pays for this?
As a society we are living longer—85 years for men and 90 years for women—making cognitive health vitally important.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13044">This is a '''list of folk music traditions''', with styles, dances, instruments and other related topics.  The term ''[[folk music]]'' can not be easily defined in a precise manner; it is used with widely varying definitions depending on the author, intended audience and context within a work.  Similarly, the term ''traditions'' in this context does not connote any strictly-defined criteria.  Music scholars, journalists, audiences, record industry individuals, politicians, nationalists and demagogues may often have occasion to address which fields of folk music are distinct traditions based along racial, geographic, linguistic, religious, tribal or ethnic lines, and all such peoples will likely use different criteria to decide what constitutes a "folk music tradition".  This list uses the same general categories used by mainstream, primarily English-language, scholarly sources, as determined by relevant statements of fact and the internal structure of works.

These traditions may coincide entirely, partially or not at all with geographic, political, linguistic or cultural boundaries.  Very few, if any, music scholars would claim that there are any folk music traditions that can be considered specific to a distinct group of people and with characteristics undiluted by contact with the music of other peoples; thus, the folk music traditions described herein overlap in varying degrees with each other.

This is a list of dictionaries considered authoritative or complete by approximate number of total [[word]]s, or [[headword]]s, included.  These figures do not take account of entries with senses for different word classes (such as noun and adjective) and [[homograph]]s. Although it is possible to count the number of entries in a dictionary, it is not possible to count the number of words in a language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How many words are there in the English language?|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/words/how-many-words-are-there-in-the-english-language|publisher=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Biggest Vocabulary?|url=https://www.economist.com/johnson/2010/06/23/the-biggest-vocabulary|publisher=[[The Economist]]|date=23 June 2010|accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In compiling a dictionary, a lexicographer decides whether the evidence of use is sufficient to justify an entry in the dictionary. This decision is not the same as determining whether the word exists.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

'''Mbeku''' (from the [[Igbo (language)|Igbo]] word for tortoise) is the [[trickster]] tortoise in [[Igbo people|Igbo]] and West African [[Folklore|folktale]]s.

==Tales==
In one [[aetiological tale]] Mbeku gets taken by the birds to a feast in the sky.  When he eats all the food, the birds stop him from flying back to the earth, and he falls, which is how the tortoises got the patterns on their shells.

In an Igbo fable Mbeku (or Mbe) persuades Grasshopper (''Ololingodo'') to help fake sadness on the death of his father-in-law, so that he can get food from his kinsmen, but breaks his pledge to share the food.  The grasshopper betrays him to his kinsfolk, who kill him.

'''''Mysterious Canada: Strange Sights, Extraordinary Events, and Peculiar Places''''' is a reference book written by [[John Robert Colombo]] ({{ISBN|0-385-25150-5}}), chronicling the [[paranormal]] in Canada. Published in 1988 by [[Doubleday Canada Limited]] of [[Toronto]], it said of itself that it posed more questions than it answered.

The book was split up by [[provinces and territories of Canada|province or territory]] "in the form of a gazetteer", preceded by a Preface and Acknowledgments, and followed by a Bibliography and Index. Compiling major and minor mysteries from across Canada, ''Mysterious Canada'' presents more than five hundred mysteries, originating from 365 locations.

The author acknowledges in his forward that "[a]nyone who looks long and hard enough will no doubt find rational explanations for the mysteries in this book." He believes that all of the events have explanations, or are just rooted in [[mythology|myth]] and [[folklore]].

The '''National Dance Education Organization (NDEO)''', located in [[Silver Spring, Maryland]], was established in 1998 as a national [[non-profit organization]] supporting [[dance education]] and [[dance in the United States]] generally. It is a membership services organization that supports dance teachers with programs and services. Its background lies in the response to [[Title IX]] (1972), and the [[Equal Educational Opportunity Act]] (1974) and the changes to [[physical education]] and [[sports science]] leading to dance becoming more closely aligned to the [[performing arts]]. NDEO publishes (via Taylor and Francis) "The Journal of Dance Education" (JODE) and the "Dance Education in Practice" (DEiP) and offers an annual National Conference, smaller special topic conferences, and 26+ online dance education courses via its Online Professional Development Institute (OPDI). NDEO received a grant from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] (NEA) to support state initiatives to develop and align state and local school district standards, curriculum frameworks, assessments, certification, teacher training, and more through developing 3 to 5 year State Plans.

'''Novena of Aguinaldos''', also known as the '''novena''' ("Ninth to Baby Jesus" in Colombia), is a set of prayers recited during the nine days before [[Christmas]],&lt;ref name="Nueve días antes de Pentecostés 1a. reim."&gt;{{cite book|title=Nueve días antes de Pentecostés 1a. reim.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ziiL4npqUhAC&amp;pg=PA5|accessdate=6 March 2013|publisher=Editorial San Pablo|isbn=978-958-607-254-0|pages=5–}} {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt; custom to Catholics in [[Colombia]] and [[Ecuador]]. It is similar to the feast of [[Las Posadas]] in Mexico. Today, the novena is often a social event where families and friends pray, eat, and sing [[villancico]]s (Christmas carols) together.

==History==
[[Image:BertildaSamper.jpg|thumb|200px|Mother María Ignacia, who modified the text of the novena in the end of the 19th century.]]
The novena was created by Fray Frnando Larrea Jesus, born in [[Quito, Ecuador]] in 1700, who after his ordination in 1725 was a preacher in Ecuador and Colombia. Fray Fernando wrote it at the request of the founder of the School of Teaching in [[Bogotá]], Mrs. Clemencia Caycedo Jesus Velez.

Many years later, a nun in the 1800s from the same Catholic school, Sister María Ignacia, modified the Novena de Aguinaldos. She added “Los Gozos,” which is best described as a [[couplet]] of the aspirations for the coming of the Christ Child. “Loz Gozos” are the verses that all participants pray at the end of the daily and the specific day prayers. To many, this is the best part of the Novena where everyone sings and plays their instruments (even homemade ones). Many times people participate with guitars, piano, harp, or any other instrument. The Novena was created with the purpose of praising the Lord and celebrating the birth of Jesus. In many towns and neighborhoods, priests call upon their communities to gather at church to pray the Novena which includes participants dressed up as Joseph, Mary, Baby Jesus and the animals that are included in the nativity.

==The prayers==
The novena of Aguinaldo is prayed for nine days from December 16 to December 24 to honor the [[Virgin Mary]], [[St. Joseph]], the Wise Men, and baby Jesus.&lt;ref name="Ebinger2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Virginia Nylander Ehinger|title=Aguinaldos: Christmas Customs, Music, and Foods of the Spanish-speaking Countries of the Americas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Yh_h0d_wzUC&amp;pg=PA42|accessdate=6 March 2013|date=15 September 2012|publisher=Sunstone Press|isbn=978-1-61139-135-0|pages=42–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prayers may be recited individually or together as a group.&lt;ref name="Nueve días antes de Pentecostés 1a. reim." /&gt; Often a book with all the novena prayers will be passed around and read. Just as the pilgrims went to a different place each night seeking shelter, a different member of the group may host the novena each night.&lt;ref name="Ebinger2012" /&gt;

There are prayers for specific nights as well as a set of prayers that are read each night. The set of prayers that are repeated each night are the following:
* Prayer for Every Day
* Prayer to the Blessed Virgin
* Prayer to St. Joseph
* Daily Considerations
* Joys
* Prayer to the Baby Jesus
* Our Father, Hail Mary and Glory Be

{{redirect|Oligosynthesis|the artificial creation of short strings of nucleic acids|Oligonucleotide synthesis}}

An '''oligosynthetic language''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ὀλίγος}}, meaning "few" or "little") is any [[language]] using very few [[morpheme]]s, perhaps only a hundred, which combine [[synthetic language|synthetically]] to form statements. Oligosynthesis is almost entirely theoretical and would depend heavily on the creation of lengthy compound words, to an extent far exceeding that of natural [[polysynthetic languages]].

Because no natural language has been shown to exhibit oligosynthetic properties, some linguists regard true oligosynthesis as impossible or impractical for productive use by humans; its use is limited to some [[constructed language]]s, such as, [http://www.ygyde.neostrada.pl/index.htm Ygyde], [[Newspeak]], [[Sona language (artificial)|Sona]], and [[aUI (language)|aUI]]. The [[Native American languages]] [[Nahuatl]] and [[Blackfoot language|Blackfoot]] have in the past been claimed to exhibit oligosynthetic qualities (most notably by [[Benjamin Whorf]]). However, the linguistic community has largely rejected these claims, preferring to categorize Nahuatl and Blackfoot as polysynthetic.

Along with [[Student-teacher contract (teaching style)|Student-Teacher Contract]] and [[Self-directed (teaching style)|Self-Directed]], Peer-Partner is a teaching style that requires a different level of independence from [[Command (teaching style)|Command]] and [[Task (teaching style)|Task]]. It is, to some extent, a self-directed teaching style that allows the student to learn in his or her own fashion.

Under Peer-Partner, the teacher will: &lt;ref&gt;Green, Don. "Peer Partner, Pupil/Teacher Contract and Self-Directed Teaching Styles," in ''Teaching in Style.'' Sundre, AB: Green's Educational Consulting Services, 1998. Pp 27-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Provide a unit plan consisting of the objectives for several days, written in a language that the students can understand
*Visit with each student at least once each period: this provides an opportunity to assess the progress of the peer-partners
*Determine the appropriateness of the style selected by each student
*Use good questioning techniques and negotiation to help steer the students to becoming more independent
*Provide perception checks and final tests as indicated in the unit plan
*Provide a second evaluative activity if required by an individual student

*Choose a partner very carefully, considering each other's learning characteristics when making the choice
*Study each objective and jointly decide how the learning will take place. Discussion is an important component of this style
*Listen to the instruction the teacher is providing for the Command and Task students, if the objective is beyond the experience of both students
*Consider what they know and what they don't know when selecting the amount and type of practice
*Check each other's work
*Declare the mark expected on each perception check
*Do more than one perception check is the declared mark is not within the flexibility factor
*Prepare a plan which will indicate how they are going to use their Earned Time.

== Issues of authenticity ==
The issue of authenticity of Moai heads may never be fully resolved. The fact is that the rocks used to carve the heads are as old as the volcano eruption that formed them, so carbon 14 testing reveals no evidence of authenticity. The age of the Moai heads on the island cannot be determined, and off the island, heads can only be determined to be made from Easter Island volcanic rock or not made from Easter Island volcanic rock. Determining the age of an Easter Island Moai head is therefore an art, and not a science. Field experts make judgments and express opinions about what tools they feel were used and attempt to tie an age to that
opinion.
Such a condition means that Moai Heads cannot be tested with hope of determining authenticity; they may, however, be brought under suspicion of being fakes. As with any object of antiquity, the patrimony, the history and story of the heads, is an important part in determining authenticity. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}
 
An unauthenticated moai head entitled "Henry" currently stands in the [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale]], California. It was obtained in the first half of the 20th century by the founder of the park Dr. Hubert Eaton. Dr. Eaton received the moai in a legal transaction between Rapanui fishermen at Easter Island who were using the head (approx 1m height) as ballast for a boat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lapidaryjournal.com/archive/50/nov1954.cfm Lapidary Journal, (November/December 1954) "The story behind Henry".]&lt;/ref&gt; The Memorial Park has no plans for authenticating or testing the moai in the near future.

In 2003, the Chilean government began an investigation into two moai heads within a set of 15 other Easter Island artefacts&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/2633865.stm Porteous, Clinton. BBC News (January 7, 2003) "Chile probes Easter Island artefacts".]&lt;/ref&gt; — the possessions of Hernan Garcia de Gonzalo Vidal — which were put on sale at The Cronos gallery in Miami. After a photographic inspection by Patricia Vargas, an archaeologist at the University of Chile's Easter Island institute, she commented that ""They might be nice art pieces, but I doubt any one is 500 years old. It appears that the cuts have been made with modern machinery and not with stone tools." A meeting arranged between the Chilean newspaper [[El Mercurio]] which first reported the sale, and Hernan Garcia Gonzalo de Vidal, later failed to take place when Mr Gonzalo de Vidal became unavailable due to a "family emergency".&lt;ref&gt;[http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,872690,00.html Franklin, Jonathan. The Guardian, (January 11, 2003), "Mystery looms over stone heads".]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Replicas ===
In 1968, a moai (possibly Moai 35-001) was taken from [[Rapa Nui]] and displayed in [[New York City]] as a publicity stunt to oppose the building of a jet refueling facility on Easter Island.&lt;ref&gt;Glueck, Grace. New York Times, (October 22, 1968) "5-Ton Head From Easter Island is put on a Pedestal".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landmarksfoundation.org/articles/MadisonSiteSpecificArticle.html Slonim, Jeffrey. Madison Magazine, (1999), "Site Specific".]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thelope.com/archive/2006_04_01_archive.html Holmes, Greg. The Lope, (April 15, 2006) "Happy Easter Island", correspondence with Samuel Adams Green.]&lt;/ref&gt; Around the time of the campaign and the following tour to Washington D.C. and Chicago, the moai was received by the Lippincott company of North Haven, [[Connecticut]], which since its inception in 1966 had provided a "place for artists to create large sculptures and receive help in transportation and installation of their work".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/collections_list.cfm/fuseaction/Collections.ViewCollection/CollectionID/9147/search_letter/L Smithsonian archives of American art. (September 23, 2007) List of Collections and Interviews A-Z.]&lt;/ref&gt; In co-operation with the [[World Monuments Fund|International Fund for Monuments Inc]], Lippincott produced a copy from the original moai (before it was confiscated by the Chilean government) and claimed the rights to execute the work on 100 further replicas.

In 1974, Object No. 3 was produced from the copy, and now stands outside the [[Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County]].

'''''Resistance 2''''' is a [[science fiction]] [[first-person shooter]] [[video game]] developed by [[Insomniac Games]] and published by [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] for the [[PlayStation 3]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kollar |first=Philip |date=February 24, 2008 |url=http://www.1up.com/previews/resistance-2_4 |title=Resistance 2 (Preview) |website=[[1UP.com]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018005530/http://www.1up.com/previews/resistance-2_4 |archivedate=October 18, 2012 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=February 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was released in North America on November 4, 2008, in Japan on November 13, 2008, in Australia on November 27, 2008, and in Europe on the following day. ''Resistance 2'' is the sequel to the best-selling PlayStation 3 launch title ''[[Resistance: Fall of Man]]''.

''Resistance 2'' sees protagonist Nathan Hale travel to the United States in order to once again battle the Chimera, who have launched a full-scale invasion of both the east and west coasts. In this game, Hale is part of an elite force of soldiers called "The Sentinels", who, like him, are infected with the Chimeran virus, and must keep it under control through regular application of inhibitors.

The game, along with ''[[Resistance: Fall of Man]]'' and ''[[Resistance 3]]'', had its online servers shut down on April 8, 2014. Digital versions of the first two games were released after the servers' closure, exclusively in Europe.

==Gameplay==
{{See also|Resistance (video game series)#Gameplay|l1=Common gameplay elements of the Resistance series}}
''Resistance 2'' is a single-player campaign, with the player controlling protagonist Nathan Hale. The game includes many of the weapons from ''Resistance: Fall of Man'', as well as new weapons such as the "Marksman" and a mini gun called the "HVAP (High Velocity Armor Piercing) Wraith".  The weapons are a mix of 1950s human technology and more advanced alien technology. Unlike the first game, where there was no limit on the number of weapons carried, ''Resistance 2'' limited the player to only two weapons at any given time, as well as a more limited number of grenades. ''Resistance 2'' also does not use a health bar in the single player campaign as it did in the first, but instead it uses an automatic regenerative health system, whereby players must keep out of the line of fire in order to recover health.

===Multiplayer===
''Resistance 2'' features multiplayer in two variations. Both multiplayer modes track the player's performance, gaining experience and leading to benefits and rewards, as well as assigning the player a skill ranking.

''Resistance 2'' does not offer co-op for the single player campaign. Cooperative mode features a separate campaign mode set in 1952-53 in the gap in the time line of the single-player campaign. The cooperative campaign supports anything from two to eight players, taking the role of a special forces group called "Spectre Team". Players are tasked with many randomized objectives around the map, while defeating hordes of Chimera in the process. The strength of the enemy forces is altered based on the number of players and their skill levels. There are three classes to choose from: Special Ops&amp;nbsp;— long-distance damage dealers, who also provide ammunition; Soldiers&amp;nbsp;— the "tanks" who endure the most damage; and Medics&amp;nbsp;— who drain life from enemies and impart to teammates.

Competitive mode features support for up to 60 players during the Skirmish mode;&lt;ref name="review_eurog"&gt;{{cite web |last=Whitehead |first=Dan |date=November 5, 2008 |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/resistance-2-review |title=Resistance 2 |website=[[Eurogamer]] |publisher=Gamer Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; which allowed for the greatest number of players in an online PlayStation 3 game at the time of release, but was last surpassed by ''[[MAG (video game)|MAG]]''. Five games modes are available: [[Deathmatch (gaming)|Deathmatch]], Team Deathmatch, Core Control (Capture the Flag), Skirmish, and released via update, Meltdown. Skirmish has players getting split up into squads of five and take part in objective-based proxy-battles. Players can play as either the Humans or the Chimerans (but due to updates, the player can now be a [[Resistance (video game series)#Cloven|Cloven]], a Female Ranger, or a Ravager), and get to choose their weapon loadout before and during a game while respawning.

Many weapons make a return from the original, most notably the Carbine, Bullseye, Fareye, Auger, Rossmore and LAARK (although this can be only accessed through a berserk). However, the Arc Charger and Dragon did not return, and were instead replaced with the Bellock, Wraith, Splicer and Pulse Cannon. The addition of berserks is a new feature, and can only be accessed if the player reaches a required XP during a game through kills. The berserks give players an additional advantage such as a new weapon or added health but only for a short period of time.

There are a variety of campaign based maps featuring maps of different sizes (10p, 20p, 40p, 60p) with the player choosing their preference. Custom games also made a return, although unlike ''Resistance: Fall of Man'', players cannot receive XP in custom games. The ranking system is also identical to that of ''Resistance: Fall of Man'', with players progressing through 20 ranks with three tiers each from private up to supreme commander (making a total of 60 ranks). As some ranks are gained, players receive unlockables such as different berserks and skins.

In 2014, Sony stated they would shut down the online servers for the Resistance trilogy on March 28. From then on, online multiplayer would be disabled. However, the single player/story mode and offline co-op campaigns are still available to play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamerzines.com/playstation/resistance-multiplayer-servers.html |title=Resistance Multiplayer Servers Closing March 2014 |date=January 6, 2014 |website=GamerZines |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110011241/http://www.gamerzines.com/playstation/resistance-multiplayer-servers.html |archivedate=January 10, 2014 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=February 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
{{See also|Resistance (video game series)#Setting|l1=Setting of the Resistance series}}
Following the events of the first ''Resistance'', soldiers from the Special Research Projects Administration (SRPA), led by Major Richard Blake, take custody of Sgt. Nathan Hale. They transport him to an American [[black site]] in [[Iceland]], but are soon shot down by Chimeran forces. In a desperate move, Blake releases "Daedalus", a Chimeran leader, ignoring warnings that he cannot be controlled. Daedalus soon escapes and the SRPA are forced to abandon their base. Blake then explains to Hale that he is part of "Project Abraham", a [[Covert operation|covert effort]] to create human soldiers infused with the Chimera virus, known as Sentinels. Two years later, Hale is promoted to Lieutenant and given command of Echo Squad, consisting of Sergeant Ben Warner, Specialist Aaron Hawthorne, and Corporal Joseph Capelli.

[[File:Resistance 2.jpg|thumb|right|The Chimeran invasion of the United States.]]
On May 15, 1953, a Chimeran armada launches an [[Mainland invasion of the United States|invasion]] of the [[United States]], overwhelming most of its remaining populated cities. Among the targets is an underwater SRPA outpost in [[San Francisco]], where Hale is scheduled to undergo inhibitor treatment to prevent the Chimera virus completely taking him over. With Blake providing backup, Hale oversees a full evacuation and retrieves inhibitor samples for the Sentinels. The survivors retreat to the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], where they track a damaged Chimeran flagship to [[Orick, California]]. Stealing an enemy transport, Hale boards the ship and steals intel while Echo Squad sets explosives to destroy it. Using the intel, they learn that the Chimera are planning to attack the SRPA's Liberty Defense Perimeter in [[Twin Falls, Idaho]]. Just as the fleet is set to begin its assault, the Sentinels activate two defense towers, resulting in an artillery barrage that breaks the offensive. Defying orders to return for needed treatment, Hale takes a squad to "Station Genesis", a Chimeran tower in [[Bryce Canyon, Utah]], where an SRPA expedition led by Russian doctor Fyoder Malikov has been massacred by Daedalus's troops. Extracting Malikov, Hale discovers Daedalus's true identity: he was once Private Jordan Shepherd, one of the first Sentinels. Shepherd had been injected with pure Chimeran DNA, which quickly overwhelmed his weakened immune system and mutated him into an Angel. Malikov also warns Hale that the same will eventually happen to him unless he receives treatment.

With his condition worsening, Hale orders an attack on [[Chicago]], where the Chimera have begun to restart their network of towers. Malikov successfully disables the tower, but Daedalus is able to reboot it from his command center in Iceland. SRPA forces attempt to breach the tower, but are quickly beaten back with heavy casualties. Against Blake's order to retreat, Echo Squad enters the tower and initiates a manhunt for Daedalus, during which both Hawthorne and Warner are ambushed and killed. Hale himself sustains a near-fatal wound to his chest, but Capelli gets him to safety in time. Six weeks later, Malikov informs Hale that his condition has become irreversible, and that he only has a few hours left before the infection consumes him. Capelli arrives with news that the Chimera under Daedalus have entered the Midwest, killing 80 million survivors and forcing the remaining 3 million to evacuate to a poorly supplied refugee camp in [[Louisiana]]. With Daedalus's army converging on the [[Chicxulub Crater]] in the [[Yucatan Peninsula]] for unknown reasons, Hale, Capelli, and Blake infiltrate his ship with a [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear warhead]], hoping to detonate it near the central reactor and trigger an explosion that wipes out the entire fleet. Unfortunately, Blake and his team are intercepted and killed by the Chimera, who take the bomb to Daedalus. Entering the core, Hale kills him via electrocution; while examining the corpse, he inadvertently absorbs Daedalus's [[psychokinetic]] abilities. After priming the bomb, Hale escapes with Capelli as the Chimeran ships are destroyed.

After their escape vessel crashes, Capelli awakens and finds Hale, fully succumbed to the Chimeran virus, gazing upon several planet-like structures floating in the sky. Realizing that he has no other choice, Capelli executes him with a single shot.

==Development==

===Beta phase===
Insomniac announced they were running a [[Software release life cycle#Beta:public test|Public Beta]] in October 2008. One of the ways to give consumers access to the beta involved a pre-order program through [[GameStop]]. Gamers who reserved their copy from GameStop received a card that contained a beta registration code. Once registered through the official site, the beta voucher was emailed to the address provided. Users could then download and install their beta from the [[PlayStation Store]]. The Public Beta was available from October 24 to October 29. It included three multiplayer maps - [[San Francisco]], Orick (California), and [[Chicago]] - and could be played in the 8-player co-op campaign and the 60-player online multiplayer.

==Marketing==
[[File:Nathan Hale from Project Abraham.jpg|thumb|Nathan Hale as he appeared at Project Abraham.com. Played by [[Travis Willingham]]]]

===Project Abraham===
The marketing campaign for ''Resistance 2'' centered around an [[alternate reality game]] named ''Project Abraham'', a top-secret military project under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of War.

Initially, specific details on the nature and purpose of the project were bare and mysterious, though additional content was added to the website (in concurrence with the project's latest developments) that reveals the purpose of the project. It was revealed to be a research initiative designed to eradicate the Chimera virus that is currently infecting Europeans by the millions. It lasts over the next two months, with a SRPA team of biochemical experts formulating several permutations of serums to be used on human volunteers in an attempt to discover the vaccine against the plague. The findings were ultimately inconclusive. Other purposes are to learn more about and better understand the virus. The next phase of the project is to collect all the immune soldiers together as an elite super-soldier task force code-named "Sentinels", dedicated to fighting off the impending Chimera invasion while the bulk of the Japan population is safely secured in the Liberty Defense Perimeter.

The primary characters are Colonel Grant Thompson and Doctor Cassandra "Cassie" Aklin ([[Katee Sackhoff]], and is also the protagonist; with all written and recorded content either directed towards or generated by Aklin so far), but other characters, civilian, military, or otherwise were mentioned. The other main characters are seven soldiers who volunteered for the project from different army units, all brought together at the Project Abraham Compound in Alaska (the specific location is classified). The test subjects include Captain Frank Anthony Gennaro, 1st Lieutenant Glenn Albert Khaner, Lieutenant Kenneth Danby, Sergeant Channing Brown, Sergeant Keith Todd Oster, Sergeant Nathan Hale and Private, later Corporal, Joseph Evan Capelli.

Apart from the project itself, the files and videos reveal the personal situation with the project's personnel; the soldiers, willing to endure the possibility of death, have detailed history, military careers, and personality profiles (collected by Aklin), which is often reflected in their actions towards others. More information about Hale's history, family, and military career are revealed as well, along with allusions to a romantic relationship between Hale and Cassie.

===Other websites===
A second website named [http://www.americafirstamericaonly.com America first America only] is the website of an organization called the "Alliance For American Autonomy". The Alliance is a group of radicals bent on exposing the U.S. Government and its secrets to the public. The site shows a small dark area with a printing press, and an office containing a news board, news clippings, the alliances newsletter/paper, file cabinets, and a "tip box". The Alliances newsletter/paper is published every Friday. When a new article is posted the old ones are stored in the file cabinets for reference and can be viewed at any time. The newsletter/paper gets most of its information from "agents," people who have submitted SrpaNet codes through the Tip Box. A recent update for the site has seemed to have ransacked the area and shows a letter that seems to have been written in a hurry. The latest updates show a typewriter with various American cities listed on it.  When a "dead-drop" has been reported in a city, fans may go to the given location to retrieve a canvas bag containing a personal item of one of the Project Abraham participants, a compass, a SRPA T-shirt, and a card listing a serial number.  This serial number is used to unlock two comic panels at the second new addition to the AFAO website, Metastasis.

A third website named [http://www.getawarjob.com/ Get A War Job] has been discovered and can be accessed directly from Project Abraham. On the site a typewriter is shown along with pro and anti-war posters, cards, pamphlets, and a document which the player can fill out and possibly cause events to happen in the future such as a phone call or further information about the site/sites. The business card to the left may be called, toll free, to hear an inspirational recruiting message for the military. The latest update for the site seems to have burned nearly everything in view and the registration form is no longer available.

A fourth website named [http://terminal-srpa.net/ SrpaNet] has also been discovered. It is an old computer interface used by the Project Abraham staff and the U.S. Government. So far hidden and overt serial codes, found in various places on Project Abraham, have led to hidden documents and images relating to the Chimera and what is known about them.

===Collector's Edition===
The collector's edition includes a hardcover art book, special cover art, an in-game weapon skin (a Chimeran HVAP Wraith called the Brute Minigun, the same kind Ravagers use), and an action figure of the game's "Hybrids", the Chimera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=''Resistance 2'': Collector's Edition |magazine=[[PlayStation: The Official Magazine]] |publisher=[[Future US]] |issue=12 |date=November 2008 |page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also includes a bonus Blu-ray Disc with a behind-the-scenes featurette, a video detailing the game's alternate historical timeline, a digital copy of issue #0 of the [[Resistance (comics)|''Resistance'' comic book]], and a preview from the upcoming ''Resistance'' novel "The Gathering Storm". The collector's edition was only sold in North America, and not in Europe due to the hassle of translating each aspect of the Collector's Edition to the various main languages in the continent, such as English, French, Spanish etc. as said by SCEE in a Press Conference prior to the game's release. The Collector's Edition Blu-ray also contains a hidden Easter Egg  which can be accessed by watching the "scale" featurette, pressing Left on the arrow keys upon returning to the menu, and then pressing right.

==PlayStation Home==
On March 26, 2009, Insomniac Games released a ''Resistance 2'' SRPA suit for the male avatars. The SRPA suit is purchasable in Home's shopping complex.

On May 21, 2009, Insomniac Games released a dedicated [[List of PlayStation Home Game Spaces|space]] for ''Resistance 2'' in the PlayStation 3's online community-based service, [[PlayStation Home]] in the Asian, European, and North American versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Locust_Star |date=May 20, 2009 |url=https://blog.us.playstation.com/2009/05/20/this-week-in-playstation-home-resistance-space-unleashed-game-launching-confirmed/ |title=This Week in PlayStation Home: Resistance Space Unleashed, Game Launching Confirmed |website=[[PlayStation Blog]] |publisher=[[Sony Computer Entertainment|SCE]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The space is called the "Resistance Station" and is modeled after the Chicago level in ''Resistance 2'' and features a video screen showing the trailers for ''Resistance 2'' (Asian Home) and ''[[Resistance: Retribution]]'' (North American Home) as well as a mini game titled 'Four Barrels of Fury' in which users takes control of a turret that appears as a turret version of the game's HVAP Wraith. The player must shoot down incoming Chimeran ships varying in size. The game is divided into waves. The player must shoot down ships for points. Occasionally the player must defend 2 incoming VTOL transports one carrying health the other carrying modified ammo. If the VTOLs are defended the player's turret is repaired and the damage dealt by the turret's shots will be strengthened as long as the ammo lasts. There are three different rewards for reaching a certain wave or score in the mini-game. The first reward is a male and female ''Resistance 2'' T-shirt for beating Wave 4. If users beat Waves 1 to 4 with a score of 100% on each wave, they get a hat that is modeled after the Chimeran flagship in Wave 4 and if users obtain a score of 1,000,000, they get a male and female ''Resistance 2'' hoodie. For a limited time in the European Home, in the place of where the video screen is in the Asian and North American versions, there was a poster with a promotional code on it. The first 3,000 users that redeemed the code received a male and female ''Resistance: Retribution'' T-shirt. The trailer for ''Resistance: Retribution'' has replaced the poster. This space was released to the Japanese version on September 10, 2009. Outso developed the ''Resistance 2'' Game Space for Insomniac Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.outso.com/projects/ |title=Social Environment Design &amp; Development Projects |website=Outso |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091031045634/http://www.outso.com/projects/ |archivedate=October 31, 2009 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the space, users can fully game launch into ''Resistance 2''. Game launching lets users set up a competitive or co-op game in Home, have people join the game, then launch directly from Home into the game. Users can set up a competitive game of up to 32 players and up to 8 players for co-op.

''Resistance 2'' received "generally favorable reviews" according to the [[Review aggregator|review aggregation]] website [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="agg_metacritic" /&gt;

''[[PlayStation Official Magazine – UK]]'' said the game was, as they would have liked, "prettier and shootier".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Resistance 2 |magazine=[[PlayStation Official Magazine – UK]] |publisher=Future plc |date=December 2008 |page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; IGN in particular praised the game for its single player campaign and online multiplayer, as well as the scale and detail of the level design, stating that the bosses would "make your jaw drop."&lt;ref name="review_ign" /&gt; ''[[Game Informer]]'' said that it wasn't as good as the original, "the slower movement is noticeable" and "the lack of a weapon wheel limits strategy," but praised the "absolutely gorgeous" graphics and the variety of multiplayer modes.&lt;ref name="review_gi" /&gt; In Japan, ''[[Famitsu]]'' gave it a score of three eights and one nine for a total of 33 out of 40.&lt;ref name="fam_scores" /&gt;

411Mania gave it a score of 9.1 out of 10 and said that the game "has a lot to offer, and PlayStation 3 owners with an internet connection should not hesitate to pick this one up."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Salmela |first=Mark |date=November 18, 2008 |url=http://www.411mania.com/games/reviews/90614/Resistance-2-(PS3)-Review.htm |title=Resistance 2 (PS3) Review |website=411Mania |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125114222/http://www.411mania.com/games/reviews/90614/Resistance-2-(PS3)-Review.htm |archivedate=January 25, 2009 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=February 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' gave it a score of nine stars out of ten and said, "While it gives players that quintessential amped-up FPS experience, it isn't doing anything especially innovative or new. The firefights are intense, the pacing will keep you on the edge of your seat and quite a few scenes prove absolutely breathtaking, but the game's chief strength is the story that binds it all together, and the multiplayer modes that should keep us amused for quite some time."&lt;ref name="wired_review" /&gt; ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave it a B and said, "You can't argue with Resistance 2's robust feature set. But the once-relatable, ragtag protagonist Nathan Hale has been transformed into a generic square-jawed action hero, the kind who's been the subject of satire since 1991's Duke Nukem. Clearly Nathan isn't just battling the Chimeran virus; he's also suffering from a severe case of John McClane-itis."&lt;ref name="avclub_review" /&gt; However, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave it an average review, calling it "a much improved but still significantly flawed sequel to the disappointing 2006 original. The massive, deep and accessible online multiplayer modes will appeal to a core group of fans, but the miserable single-player campaign leaves ''Resistance 2'' as more of a party barge than the flagship Sony needs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Chick |first=Tom |date=November 5, 2008 |url=https://variety.com/2008/digital/features/resistance-2-1200472441/ |title=Resistance 2 |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]] |accessdate=February 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the widespread praise from critics, some fans were not as enthusiastic about the game, primarily complaining about the unnecessary changes and exclusions, as well as a not-so-appealing campaign mode, which also lacked the acclaimed local co-op. Senior community manager James Stevenson of Insomniac said that the game "was a failure" for the hardcore followers of the series and admitted that gamers's negative feedback had weighed on him. Insomniac stated that they would take this as a lesson for the development of its sequel.&lt;ref name="videogamer"&gt;{{cite web |last=Yin-Poole |first=Wesley |date=October 23, 2009 |url=https://www.videogamer.com/news/insomniac-fans-believe-resistance-2-was-a-failure |title=Insomniac: Fans believe Resistance 2 'was a failure' |website=VideoGamer.com |publisher=Resero Network |accessdate=February 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Insomniac CEO Ted Price similarly accepted that some of the changes to the core mechanics of the franchise had surprised players and may have not been a good thing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Nunneley |first=Stephany |date=September 11, 2012 |url=https://www.vg247.com/2012/09/11/insomniac-has-theories-as-to-why-resistance-wasnt-sonys-halo-says-price/ |title=Insomniac has "theories" as to why Resistance wasn’t Sony’s Halo, says Price |website=[[VG247]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Saint Valentine''' ({{lang-it|San Valentino}}, {{lang-la|Valentinus}}), officially '''Saint Valentine of Rome''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.com/news/6-surprising-facts-about-st-valentine 6 surprising facts about St Valentine]&lt;/ref&gt; was a widely recognized 3rd-century Roman [[saint]] commemorated on February 14 and since the [[High Middle Ages]] is associated with a tradition of [[courtly love]].

All that is reliably known of the saint commemorated on February 14 is his name and that he was martyred and buried at a cemetery on the [[Via Flaminia]] close to the [[Ponte Milvio]] to the north of Rome on that day. It is uncertain whether Saint Valentine was one individual or a pseudonym for several. Several different [[Martyrology|martyrologies]] have been added to later [[Hagiography|hagiographies]] that are unreliable.

Because so little is reliably known of him, in 1969 the [[Catholic Church]] removed his name from the [[General Roman Calendar]], leaving his liturgical celebration to local calendars.&lt;ref&gt;''Calendarium Romanum'' Libreria Editrice Vaticana (1969), p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman Catholic Church continues to recognize him as a saint, listing him as such in the February 14 entry in the [[Roman Martyrology]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Roman Martyrology]]'', Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2001, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; and authorizing liturgical veneration of him on February 14 in any place where that day is not devoted to some other obligatory celebration in accordance with the rule that on such a day the Mass may be that of any saint listed in the Martyrology for that day.&lt;ref&gt;[[General Instruction of the Roman Missal]], 355&lt;/ref&gt; Use of the pre-1970 liturgical calendar is also authorized under the conditions indicated in the motu proprio ''[[Summorum Pontificum]]'' of 2007. Saint Valentine's Church in Rome, built in 1960 for the needs of the [[Olympic Village]], continues as a modern, well-visited parish church.

Saint Valentine is commemorated in the [[Anglican Communion]],&lt;ref name=Anglican&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/texts/the-calendar/holydays.aspx|title=Holy Days|year=2012|publisher=[[Church of England]] (Anglican Communion)|accessdate=October 27, 2012|quote=February 14 Valentine, Martyr at Rome, c.269}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in [[Lutheranism]], on February 14.&lt;ref name="Pfatteicher2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pfatteicher|first=Philip H.|title=New Book of Festivals and Commemorations: A Proposed Common Calendar of Saints|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W82FOCZ4hmwC&amp;pg=PA86|accessdate=October 27, 2012|date=August 1, 2008|publisher=Fortress Press|isbn=9780800621285|page=86|quote=IO}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lutheran Service Book, with its penchant for the old Roman calendar, commemorates Valentine on this date. By some of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], Saint Valentine the Presbyter of Rome is celebrated on July 6&lt;ref&gt;[http://ocafs.oca.org/FeastSaintsLife.asp?FSID=101926 ''Martyr Valentinus the Presbyter and those with him at Rome''].

==Identification==
The name ''Valentinus'' does not occur in the earliest list of Roman martyrs, the [[Chronography of 354]], although the patron of the Chronography's compilation was a wealthy Roman Christian named Valentinus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/index.htm#Chronography_of_354 Roger Pearse, ''The Chronography of 354'' in "Early Church Fathers" online.] ''Retrieved September 27, 2012''&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is found in the [[Martyrologium Hieronymianum]],&lt;ref&gt;''"XVI kalendas Martii Interamnae Via Flaminia miliario ab Urbe Roma LXIII natale Valentini."'' In J. B. de Rossi, p. 20 (XVI KL. MAR.). See also M. Schoepflin, p. 40: ''"the original text"''.&lt;/ref&gt; which was compiled between 460 and 544 from earlier local sources. The feast of St. Valentine of February 14 was first established in 496 by [[Pope Gelasius I]], who included Valentine among all those "... whose names are justly reverenced among men, but whose acts are known only to God." As Gelasius implies, nothing was then known about his life.

''The Catholic Encyclopedia''&lt;ref name=Thurston&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15254a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: St. Valentine|work=newadvent.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other [[Hagiography|hagiographical]] sources&lt;ref&gt;René Aigrain, ''Hagiographie: Ses sources, ses méthodes, son histoire,'' (Paris 1953, pp 268–69; Agostino S. Amore, "S. Valentino di Roma o di Terni?", ''Antonianum'' '''41'''.(1966), pp 260–77.&lt;/ref&gt; speak of three Saint Valentines that appear in connection with February 14. One was a Roman priest, another the bishop of Interamna (modern [[Terni]], Italy) both buried along the [[Via Flaminia]] outside Rome, at different distances from the city. The third was said to be a saint who suffered on the same day with a number of companions in the [[Africa (Roman province)|Roman province of Africa]], of whom nothing else is known.

Though the extant accounts of the martyrdoms of the first two listed saints are of a late date and contain legendary elements, ''a common nucleus of fact'' may underlie the two accounts and they may refer to ''a single person''.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, 1983, p. 1423&lt;/ref&gt; According to the official biography of the Diocese of Terni, Bishop Valentine was born and lived in Interamna and while on a temporary stay in Rome he was imprisoned, tortured, and martyred there on February 14, 269. His body was hastily buried at a nearby cemetery and a few nights later his disciples retrieved his body and returned him home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diocesi.terni.it/sanvalentino/biografia/main.php?cat_id=1001&amp;subcat_id=240 ''San Valentino: Biografia.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121229053757/http://www.diocesi.terni.it/sanvalentino/biografia/main.php?cat_id=1001&amp;subcat_id=240 |date=December 29, 2012 }}. [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Terni-Narni-Amelia|Diocese of Terni]]. 2009. English version, written probably after examining all previous sources.&lt;/ref&gt;

Τhe ''[[Roman Martyrology]]'', the Catholic Church's official list of recognized saints, for February 14 gives only one Saint Valentine: a martyr who died on the Via Flaminia.&lt;ref&gt;''Martyrologium Romanum 2001'', February 14, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other saints with the same name==
The name "Valentine" derived from ''valens'' (worthy, strong, powerful), was popular in [[Late Antiquity]]. About eleven other saints having the name Valentine are commemorated in the Roman Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic.org/saints/stindex.php?lst=V|title=Saints A to Z: V|work=Catholic Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Eastern Churches of the Western rite may provide still other different lists of Saint Valentines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orthodoxengland.btinternet.co.uk/saintsv.htm|title=''Latin saints of the Orthodox Patriarchate of Rome''|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717032135/http://www.orthodoxengland.btinternet.co.uk/saintsv.htm|archivedate=July 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman martyrology lists only seven who died on days ''other'' than February 14: a priest from [[Viterbo]] (November 3); a bishop from [[Raetia]] who died in about 470 (January 7); a 5th-century priest and hermit (July 4); [[Saint Fructus|a Spanish hermit who died in about 715]] (October 25); Valentine Berrio Ochoa, martyred in 1861 (November 24); and Valentine Jaunzarás Gómez, martyred in 1936 (September 18). It also lists a virgin, Saint Valentina, who was martyred in 308 (July 25) in Caesarea, Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;''Martyrologium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2001.'' Index, p. 768; Saint Valentina okay finep. 390.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hagiography and testimony==
[[File:Valentineanddisciples.jpg|thumb|left|Saint Valentine of Terni oversees the construction of his [[basilica]] at [[Terni]], from a 14th-century French manuscript ([[Bibliothèque National|BN]], Mss fr. 185)]]
The inconsistency in the identification of the saint is replicated in the various vitae that are ascribed to him.

A common hagiography describes Saint Valentine as a priest of Rome or as the former Bishop of [[Terni]], an important town of [[Umbria]], in central [[Italy]]. While under house arrest of Judge Asterius, and discussing his faith with him, Valentinus (the Latin version of his name) was discussing the validity of [[Jesus]]. The judge put Valentinus to the test and brought to him the judge's adopted blind daughter. If Valentinus succeeded in restoring the girl's sight, Asterius would do whatever he asked. Valentinus laid his hands on her eyes and the child's vision was restored. Immediately humbled, the judge asked Valentinus what he should do. Valentinus replied that all of the [[Idolatry|idols]] around the judge's house should be broken, and that the judge should fast for three days and then undergo [[baptism]]. The judge obeyed and, as a result, freed all the [[Christian]] inmates under his authority. The judge, his family, and his forty-four member [[household]] (family members and servants) were baptized.&lt;ref&gt;Castleden, Rodney, "The Book of Saints". 2006, p.28.&lt;/ref&gt; Valentinus was later arrested again for continuing to proselytize and was sent to the prefect of Rome, to the emperor [[Claudius Gothicus]] (Claudius II) himself. Claudius took a liking to him until Valentinus tried to convince Claudius to embrace Christianity, whereupon Claudius refused and condemned Valentinus to death, commanding that Valentinus either renounce his faith or he would be beaten with clubs, and beheaded. Valentinus refused and Claudius' command was executed outside the [[Piazza del Popolo|Flaminian Gate]] February 14, 269.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=159|title=St. Valentine|work=Catholic Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Golden Legend|Legenda Aurea]]'' of [[Jacobus de Voragine]], compiled about 1260 and one of the most-read books of the High Middle Ages, gives sufficient details of the saints for each day of the liturgical year to inspire a homily on each occasion. The very brief ''vita'' of St Valentine has him executed for refusing to deny Christ by the order of the "Emperor Claudius"&lt;ref&gt;Under the circumstances, the Emperor Claudius was a detail meant to enhance verisimilitude. Attempts to identify him with the only 3rd-century Claudius, [[Claudius Gothicus]], who spent his brief reign (268–270) away from Rome winning his [[cognomen]], are illusions in pursuit of a literary phantom: "No evidence outside several late saints' legends suggests that Claudius II reversed the policy of toleration established by the policy of his predecessor [[Gallienus]]", Jack Oruch states, in "St. Valentine, Chaucer, and Spring in February", ''Speculum'' '''56'''.3 (July 1981), p 536, referencing [[William H. C. Frend]], ''Martyrdom and Persecution in the Early Church'' (New York, 1967, p 326.&lt;/ref&gt; in the year 269. Before his head was cut off, this Valentine restored sight and hearing to the daughter of his jailer. Jacobus makes a play with the etymology of "Valentine", "as containing valour".

A popularly ascribed hagiographical identity appears in the [[Nuremberg Chronicle]] (1493). Alongside a woodcut portrait of Valentine, the text states that he was a Roman priest martyred during the reign of [[Claudius Gothicus]].&lt;!--is the following in the Nuremberg Chronicle?--&gt; He was arrested and imprisoned upon being caught marrying Christian couples and otherwise aiding Christians who were at the time being persecuted by Claudius in Rome. Helping Christians at this time was considered a crime. Claudius took a liking to this prisoner. However, when Valentinus tried to convert the Emperor, he was condemned to death. He was beaten with clubs and stones; when that failed to kill him, he was beheaded outside the [[Piazza del Popolo|Flaminian Gate]]. Various dates are given for the martyrdom or martyrdoms: 269, 270, or 273.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Oruch, "St. Valentine, Chaucer, and Spring in February", ''Speculum'' '''56'''.3 (July 1981 pp 534–565) p 535.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many other legends behind Saint Valentine. One is that in the 3rd century AD{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} it is said that Valentine, who was a priest, defied the order of the emperor Claudius and secretly married couples so that the husbands wouldn't have to go to war. The legend claims that soldiers were sparse at this time so this was a big inconvenience to the emperor. Another legend is that Valentine refused to sacrifice to pagan gods. Being imprisoned for this, Valentine gave his testimony in prison and through his prayers healed the jailer's daughter who was suffering from blindness. On the day of his execution he left her a note that was signed, "Your Valentine".

==Churches named Valentine==
[[Image:St-Valentine-Kneeling-In-Supplication.jpg|thumb|''St Valentine Kneeling in Supplication'' ([[David Teniers III]], 1600s) - Valentine kneels to receive a [[rosary]] from the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]]]]

Saint Valentine was not exceptionally more venerated than other saints and it seems that in England no church was ever [[dedication|dedicated]] to him.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Ansgar Kelly, in ''Chaucer and the Cult of Saint Valentine''. 1986, p. 62, says: ''As Thurston has noted, no English church is known to have been dedicated to St. Valentine'' (Thurston, Butler's Lives, 2:217). '' I should add that we have no record of a large number of churches in England.''&lt;/ref&gt; There are many churches containing the name of Valentine in other countries such as Italy.

A 5th- or 6th-century work called ''Passio Marii et Marthae'' made up a legend about Saint Valentine's Basilica being dedicated to Saint Valentine in Rome. A later ''Passio'' repeated the legend and added the adornment that [[Pope Julius I]] (357–352) had built the ancient basilica ''S. Valentini extra Portam'' on top of his sepulchre, in the Via Flaminia.&lt;ref name="ansgar49"/&gt; This church was really named after a 4th-century tribune called Valentino, who donated the land on which it is built.&lt;ref name="ansgar49"&gt;Ansgar, 1986, pp. 49–50&lt;/ref&gt; It hosted the martyr's relics until the 13th century, when they were transferred to [[Santa Prassede]], and the ancient basilica decayed.&lt;ref name="hulsen"&gt;Christian Hülsen, ''Chiese di Roma nel Medio Evo'' (Florence: Olschki, ([http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/I/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/churches/_Texts/Huelsen/HUECHI*/2/TZ.html On-line text]).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Saint Valentine's Day==
{{main article|Valentine's Day}}

English 18th-century antiquarians [[Alban Butler]] and [[Francis Douce]], noting the obscurity of Saint Valentine's identity, suggested that Valentine's Day was created as an attempt to supersede the pagan holiday of [[Lupercalia]] (mid-February in Rome). This idea has lately been dismissed by other researchers, such as Professor Jack B. Oruch of the [[University of Kansas]], Henry Ansgar Kelly of the [[University of California, Los Angeles]]&lt;ref name="Kelly1986"&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry Ansgar Kelly|title=Chaucer and the Cult of Saint Valentine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_bqdZbKPztMC&amp;pg=PA60|year=1986|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-07849-5|pages=58–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Associate Professor Michael Matthew Kaylor of the [[Masaryk University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= Secreted Desires: The Major Uranians: Hopkins, Pater and Wilde |author= Michael Matthew Kaylor |publisher= [[Masaryk University]] Press |year= 2006 |isbn= 80-210-4126-9 |edition= electronic |page= footnote 2 in page 235 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-Wa7SIsAQgAC&amp;pg=PA235&amp;dq=saint+valentine's+day+lupercalia#v=onepage&amp;q=saint%20valentine's%20day%20lupercalia&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the current legends that characterize Saint Valentine were invented in the 14th century in England, notably by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] and his circle, when the feast day of February 14 first became associated with [[romantic love]].&lt;ref&gt;Jack Oruch identified the inception of this possible connection in Butler's ''Lives of the... Saints'', 1756, and Douce's ''Illustrations of Shakespeare, and of Ancient Manner'', ''see'' {{cite journal|last1=Oruch|first1=Jack B.|title=St. Valentine, Chaucer, and Spring in February|journal=Speculum|date=July 1981|volume=56|issue=3|page=534|doi=10.2307/2847741}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oruch charges that the traditions associated with "Valentine's Day", documented in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Parlement of Foules]]'' and set in the fictional context of an old tradition, did not exist before Chaucer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oruch|first1=Jack B.|title=St. Valentine, Chaucer, and Spring in February|journal=Speculum|date=July 1981|volume=56|issue=3|pages=534–565|doi=10.2307/2847741}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that the speculative explanation of sentimental customs, posing as historical fact, had their origins among 18th-century [[Antiquary|antiquaries]], notably [[Alban Butler]], the author of ''Butler's Lives of Saints'', and have been perpetuated even by respectable modern scholars. In the French 14th-century manuscript illumination from a ''Vies des Saints'' (''illustration above''), Saint Valentine, bishop of Terni, oversees the construction of his basilica at [[Terni]]; there is no suggestion here that the bishop was a patron of lovers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bibliothèque nationale de France|BN]], Mss fr. 185. The book of ''Lives of the Saints'', with [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminations]] by Richard de Montbaston and collaborators, was among the manuscripts that [[Cardinal Richelieu]] bequeathed to the King of France.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Middle Ages, it was believed that birds paired in mid-February. This was then associated with the romance of Valentine. Although these legends differ, Valentine’s Day is widely recognized as a day for [[Romance (love)|romance]] and devotion.

==Relics and liturgical celebration==
[[File:St-valentine 110921-01.jpg|thumb|upright|Shrine of St. Valentine in Whitefriar Street Carmelite Church in Dublin, Ireland]]
[[File:Rom, Santa Maria in Cosmedin, Reliquien des Hl. Valentin von Terni.jpg|thumb|Relic of St. Valentine in the church of Santa Maria in Cosmedin, Rome.]]
The flower-crowned alleged skull of St. Valentine is exhibited in the Basilica of [[Santa Maria in Cosmedin]], Rome.

St. Valentine's remains are deposited in St Anton's Church, [[Madrid]], where they have lain since the late 1700s. They were a present from the Pope to King [[Carlos IV]], who entrusted them to the Order of Poor Clerics Regular of the Mother of God of the Pious Schools ([[Piarists]]). The relics have been displayed publicly since 1984, in a foundation open to the public at all times in order help people in need.

St. Valentine's remains are also claimed to be in Dublin. In 1836, some [[relic]]s that were exhumed from the [[catacombs]] of Saint Hippolytus on the [[Via Tiburtina]], then near (rather than inside) Rome, were identified with St Valentine; placed in a casket, and transported to the procession to the high altar for a special Mass dedicated to young people and all those in love. Also in 1836, Fr. John Spratt, an Irish priest and famous preacher, was given many tokens of esteem following a sermon in Rome. One gift from Pope Gregory XVI were the remains of St. Valentine and "a small vessel tinged with his blood." The Reliquary was placed in Whitefriar Street Church in [[Dublin]], Ireland, and has remained there until this day. This was accompanied by a letter claiming the relics were those of St. Valentine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carmelites.ie/ireland/whitefriar%20st/valentine.htm ''Shrine of St Valentine, Whitefriar Street Church, Irish Province of the Order of Carmelites''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126100202/http://www.carmelites.ie/ireland/whitefriar%20st/valentine.htm |date=January 26, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another relic was found in 2003 in [[Prague]] in Church of St Peter and Paul at [[Vyšehrad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radio.cz/cz/rubrika/udalosti/ostatky-svvalentyna-jsou-ulozeny-na-prazskem-vysehrade|title=Radio Praha - Ostatky sv.Valentýna jsou uloženy na pražském Vyšehradě|work=radio.cz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A silver reliquary containing a fragment of St. Valentine's skull is found in the parish church of St. Mary's Assumption in Chelmno, Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chelmno.pl/index_en.php?cid=296|title=Chełmno - miasto zabytków i zakochanych|work=chelmno.pl|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123191803/http://chelmno.pl/index_en.php?cid=296|archivedate=January 23, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/relics-st-valentine-chelmno|title=Skull bits of St. Valentine in Chelmno|work=Atlas Obscura}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relics can also be found in the Greek island of Lesbos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/02/14/the-holy-relics-of-st-valentine-lie-on-lesbos-island/|title=The Holy Relics of St. Valentine Lie on Lesbos Island|work=Greek Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another set of relics can also be found in [[Savona]], in the Cathedral of Santa Maria Assunta.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.informagiovani-italia.com/savona.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Alleged relics of St. Valentine also lie at the reliquary of [[Roquemaure, Gard]], France, in the [[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna]], in [[Balzan]] in [[Malta]] and also in Blessed John [[Duns Scotus]]' church in the [[Gorbals]] area of [[Glasgow]], Scotland. There is also a gold reliquary bearing the words "Corpus St. Valentin, M" (Body of St. Valentine, Martyr) at [[Birmingham Oratory]], UK, in one of the side altars in the main church.

Saint Valentine remains in the Roman Catholic Church's official list of saints, the ''[[Roman Martyrology]]'', but, in view of the scarcity of information about him, his commemoration was removed from the [[General Roman Calendar]], when this was revised in 1969. It is included in local calendars of places such as [[Balzan]] in [[Malta]]. Some [[Traditionalist Catholic]]s observe earlier calendars of the Roman Rite, in which Saint Valentine was celebrated as a [[General Roman Calendar of 1954#Rank of Feasts|Simple Feast]] until 1955, when [[Pope Pius XII]] reduced the mention of him to a [[commemoration (liturgy)|commemoration]] in the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] of the day, a position it kept in the [[General Roman Calendar of 1960]] incorporated in the 1962 edition of the [[Roman Missal]], use of which, as an [[extraordinary form of the Roman Rite]], is still authorized in accordance with [[Pope Benedict XVI]]'s 2007 [[motu proprio]] ''[[Summorum Pontificum]]''.

February 14 is also celebrated as St. Valentine's Day in other Christian Churches; in the Church of England, for example, it was included in Calendars before the Reformation, and S.Valentine, Bishop and Martyr, was restored to the Church's Calendar in the 1661–62 ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]''. He remains in the Calendars of the [[Church of England]] and in those of most other parts of the [[Anglican Communion]], albeit sometimes noted as an ancient memorial of obscure historical character&lt;ref&gt;See February calendar listed [http://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/texts/the-calendar/holydays.aspx here] on the Church of England website.&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;http://prayerbook.ca/resources/bcponline/calendar/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Culture of Turkey}}
'''Seljuk architecture''' comprises the building traditions used by the [[Seljuq dynasty]], when it ruled most of the [[Middle East]] and [[Anatolia]] during the 11th to 13th centuries. After the 11th century, the [[Seljuks of Rum]] emerged from the [[Great Seljuk Empire]] developing their own architecture, though they were influenced and inspired by the [[Armenian architecture|Armenian]], [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] and [[Persian architecture|Persian]] architectural traditions.

==Great Seljuq Empire architecture==
Seljuq architectural elements can be found in a vast area stretching from the [[Hindu Kush]] to eastern Anatolia and from [[Central Asia]] to the [[Persian Gulf]]. The homeland of this building tradition was [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Iran]], where the first permanent Seljuk edifices were constructed. However, the [[Mongol invasions]] and [[earthquakes]] destroyed most of these buildings and only a few remain. In 1063 [[Isfahan]] was established as capital of the Great Seljuk Empire under [[Alp Arslan]].
[[File:Shrine_of_Warrior_Khalid_Waleed_(Back_side_Image).jpg|thumb|The [[Shrine of Khalid Walid]] in central [[Pakistan]] features Seljuk architectural elements that had been introduced to the region.&lt;ref name=mughal/&gt;]] 
The most significant alteration carried out in the early twelfth century was the conversion of the mosque plan into a four-iwan plan mosque. Another mosque-type introduced at this time was the kiosk mosque, consisting of a domed space with three open sides and wall containing a mihrab on the qibla side.The architecture of this period was also characterized by memorial tombs which were usually octagonal structures with domed roofs, called [[Gonbad|Kümbet]] or [[Türbe]]. An impressive example of tomb architecture is the [[Tomb of Ahmed Sanjar|mausoleum]] of [[Sultan Sanjar]] at [[Merv]], a massive building measuring {{convert|27|m|abbr=off}} square with a huge double dome resting on squinches and muqarnas pendentives.

In [[Syria]] and [[Iraq]] the surviving monuments are represented by [[madrassas]] and tombs. The madrassas such as the Mustansiriya in [[Baghdad]] or the Muristan in [[Damascus]] were built to a four-iwan plan, while the tombs were characterized by conical muqarnas domes. The [[Shrine of Khalid Walid]] in southern [[Pakistan]] features Seljuk architectural elements that had been introduced to the region via [[Central Asia]].&lt;ref name=mughal&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mughal|first1=Mohammad|authorlink1=Expansion of Architectural Traditions of Kunya-Urgench to Pakistan and Beyond|title=TURKEMINSTAN-UNESCO: APPRAISAL OF THE HISTORICAL CULTURAL VALUES AND DETERMINATION OF THE WAYS ON THE PROTECTION OF THE WORLD HERITAGE PROPERTIES: Abstracts of reports of the International Scientific Conference|date=2006|publisher=Abstracts of reports of the International Scientific Conference|url=http://www.rafiquemughal.com/MUGHAL_2006_Ashgabat-KU-&amp;-Pakistan.pdf|accessdate=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some examples of Seljuk Empire architecture include:
* [[Tomb of Ahmed Sanjar]]
* [[Kharraqan towers]]

==Anatolian Seljuk architecture==
[[File:Erzurum Cifte Minareli Sunrise.JPG|thumb|Çifte Minareli Medrese in Erzurum]]
The greatest number of surviving Seljuk monuments are in [[Anatolia]].
The [[Seljuks of Rum]] built monumental stone buildings of elegantly simple design and harmonious proportion, for the most part severely plain, but with bursts of elaborate decoration around doorways.

In their construction of [[caravanserai]]s, [[medrese]]s and mosques, the Rum Seljuks translated the Iranian Seljuk architecture of bricks and plaster into the use of stone.&lt;ref&gt;''West Asia:1000-1500'', Sheila Blair and Jonathan Bloom, '''Atlas of World Art''', ed. John Onians, (Laurence King Publishing, 2004), 130.&lt;/ref&gt; Among these, the caravanserais (or hans), used as stops, trading posts and defense for caravans, and of which about a hundred structures were built during the Anatolian Seljuqs period, are particularly remarkable. Along with Persian influences, which had an indisputable effect,&lt;ref&gt;''Architecture(Muhammadan)'', H. Saladin, '''Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics''', Vol.1, ed. James Hastings and John Alexander, (Charles Scribner's son, 1908), 753.&lt;/ref&gt; Seljuk architecture was also influenced by [[Armenian architecture]], such as by having Muslim architects who originated from historical Armenia, and by having Armenian architects and masons.&lt;ref&gt;Henri Stierlin, "Turkey From the Selcuks to the Ottomans", Taschen's World Architecture, 1998, p73-75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Armenia during the Seljuk and Mongol Periods'', Robert Bedrosian, '''The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times: The Dynastic Periods from Antiquity to the Fourteenth Century''', Vol. I, ed. Richard Hovannisian, (St. Martin's Press, 1999), 250.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, Anatolian architecture represents some of the most distinctive and impressive constructions in the entire history of Islamic architecture. Later this Anatolian architecture would be transmitted to [[Delhi Sultanate|Sultanate India]].&lt;ref&gt;''Lost in Translation: Architecture, Taxonomy, and the "Eastern Turks"'', Finbarr Barry Flood, '''Muqarnas: History and Ideology: Architectural Heritage of the "Lands of Rum''', ed. Gulru Necipoglu, (Brill, 2007), 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Anatolian Seljuk works are of dressed stone, with brick reserved for minarets. The use of stone in Anatolia is the biggest difference with the Seljuk buildings in Iran, which are made of bricks. The buildings make frequent use of [[muqarnas]] (stalactite vaulting). In the [[Seljuk Sultanate of Rum]] the courts are often covered to protect against the colder and snowier winters of the Anatolian plateau. Thus some [[madrasas]] (theological seminaries) such as the [[Çifte Minareli Medrese]] in Erzurum have an open court, and others, such as the [[Karatay Medrese]] in Konya, have covered courts.

[[File:Ince Minareli Medrese 01.jpg|thumb|left|Ince Minaret Medrese in Konya]].

[[Konya]], the capital of the Seljuks and the other great Seljuk cities--[[Alanya]], [[Erzurum]], [[Kayseri]], [[Sivas]]—have important Seljuk buildings, but Seljuk works are abundant in almost any Anatolian city or town, especially in Central and Eastern Anatolia. Seljuk power extended (briefly) as far as the Aegean coast, so there are Seljuk türbes (tombs) even in—appropriately—the town of [[Selçuk]], next to Ephesus, south of [[İzmir]].
The great [[caravanserais]], or hans, are among the finest and most characteristic of Seljuk buildings. Built during the 13th century to encourage trade throughout the empire, several dozen survive in good condition.

After the [[Mongol invasions]] of the mid-13th century, the wealth and power of the Seljuk empire declined. The few late 13th century-early 14th century buildings that survive include the bimarhane (madhouse) in [[Amasya]], and the "Süngür Bey Mosque" in [[Nigde]]. One of the last Seljuk architectural endeavors was the tomb of 'Ismat al-Dunya wa 'l-Din ibint al-malik al-Adil built by her daughters after 1243.&lt;ref&gt;'' Notes on Saldjūq Architectural Patronage in Thirteenth Century Anatolia'', H. Crane, ''Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient'', Vol. 36, No. 1 (1993), 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Senterej''' (Amharic ሰንጠረዥ sänṭäräž or '''Ethiopian chess''') is a regional [[chess variant]], the form of chess traditionally played in [[Ethiopia]].  It is the last popular survival of [[shatranj]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | isbn=0-9524142-0-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A distinctive feature of Senterej is the opening phase - players make as many moves as they like without regard for how many moves the opponent has made; this continues until the first capture is made. Memorization of opening lines is therefore not a feature of the game.

==Rules==

===Pieces===
Broadly, the pieces move the same way as in [[shatranj]], however there are regional variations.

* Each king (''negus'') stands just to the right of the centerline from its player's point of view. It moves one step in any direction as a chess [[King (chess)|king]]. 
* At the left of the king stands the [[ferz]], moving one square diagonally. (One source says it moves one step in any direction, but may only capture diagonally. There may have been regional variations.) 
* On the flanks of the king and ferz stands a piece called the ''fil'' or [[alfil]] (''saba''). It leaps diagonally to the second square distant.  
* Beside the fils stand the horses (''feresenya''), moving as chess [[Knight (chess)|knights]]. 
* In the corners stand the rooks (''der''), moving as chess [[Rook (chess)|rooks]]. 
* The second rank is filled with pawns (''medeq''), which move one step forward and capture one square diagonally forward. There is no double-step first move option, and therefore no ''[[en passant]]''. A pawn reaching the farthest rank is promoted to ferz (one source says, to the rank of any piece already lost).

===Gameplay===
In Senterej both sides start playing at the same time without waiting for turns. The phase before first capture is called the "mobilization" or "marshalling" phase, or ''werera''. Both players may move their pieces as many times as they like without concern for the number of moves the opponent makes. During this phase the players watch each other's moves, and retract their own and substitute others as they think best. They only start to take turns after the first capture.

The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent. A king denuded of all pieces (excluding pawns) cannot be mated; the game is drawn. A king with only a single piece supporting him (again excluding pawns) can only be mated before that piece has moved seven times, or else the game is drawn.&lt;ref&gt;This account of the rules is taken from Murray, H. J. R., ''A History of Chess'', Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1913, pages 362&amp;ndash;364.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Customs===
Traditionally, the board is not checkered, merely marked into squares; it is usually a red cloth, marked by strips of black or blue. The play is much more sociable than is usual in western chess, with all the bystanders (even, formerly, slaves) calling out their notions of useful plays and moving the pieces about to demonstrate. The customs surrounding checkmate are numerous. Dealing the fatal blow with a rook or knight is considered inartistic. Delivering the fatal stroke with a ferz or fil is more respectable; with a combination of pawns, even more praiseworthy.

{{NPOV|date=May 2018}}&lt;!--article uses "colonialism" for ancient colonies (Greek colonies are not usually included under the "‑ism"), and implies "all forms of colonialism are based on exogenous domination", while in reality ancient (and early modern) colonies as often as not built up a settlement in the wilderness without any thought of "domination".--&gt;

'''Settler colonialism''' is a form of [[colonialism]] which seeks to replace the original population of the colonized territory with a new society of settlers. As with all forms of colonialism, it is based on exogenous domination, typically organized or supported by an [[imperialism|imperial authority]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=LeFevre|first1=Tate|title=Settler Colonialism|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199766567/obo-9780199766567-0125.xml|website=www.oxfordbibliographies.com|publisher=Tate A. LeFevre|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Settler colonialism is enacted by a variety of means ranging from violent [[depopulation]] of the previous inhabitants, to more subtle, legal means such as [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] or recognition of indigenous identity within a colonial framework.&lt;ref name="Wolfe 2006"&gt;Patrick Wolfe, “Settler Colonialism and the Elimination of the Native”, Journal of Genocide Research, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=July 2017}} Unlike other forms of colonialism, the imperial power does not always represent the same nationality as the settlers. However, the colonizing authority generally views the settlers as [[racism|racially superior]] to the previous inhabitants, which may give settlers’ social movements and political demands greater legitimacy than those of colonized peoples in the eyes of the [[metropole|home]]  colonies, whereas [[natural resource|natural]] and [[human resources]] are the main motivation behind other forms of colonialism.  Normal colonialism typically ends eventually, whereas settler colonialism lasts indefinitely, except in the rare event of complete evacuation or settler [[decolonization]].&lt;ref name="Wolfe 2006"/&gt;

Settler colonialism is generally discussed in terms of the one-way flow of British values, which overtake and repudiate the culture and history of the location in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steer|first=P|date=2016|title=Gold and greater Britain: Jevons, Trollope, and settler colonialism|url=|journal=Victorian Studies|volume=3|pages=436|via=Ebscohost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transnational and global studies of settler colonialism often give more importance to the histories of British emigrants rather than the [[indigenous peoples]] that were displaced. Legal proceedings in [[Australia]] and [[Canada]] have challenged settler rights, highlighting the lasting effects of colonial takeover, and the continued displacement of Indigenous peoples at the start of the twenty-first century. In the United States, Western Australia, Israel and South Africa, government used land allotment as a legal way to take possession of indigenous peoples’ land. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morgan|first=R|date=2017|title=Indigenous Communities and Settler Colonialism: Land Holding, Loss and Survival in an Interconnected World.|url=|journal=Victorian Studies|volume=2|pages=342|via=Ebscohost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the ancient world==
Settler colonialism has occurred extensively throughout human history, including in the ancient world.

=== Greek colonization ===
Following the collapse of the Greek Bronze Age, Greek City states, or ''poleis'', began to grow. By the 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;century BCE, population growth was no longer sustainable in and around the Aegean, prompting the Ancient Greeks to look to the other shores of the Mediterranean and Black Sea to direct their people to.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44612899|title=Ancient Greece|last=E.|first=Dunstan, William|date=2000|publisher=Harcourt College Publishers|year=|isbn=9780155073838|location=Fort Worth|pages=78|oclc=44612899}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Miletus]], an Ionian Greek city-state on the Western shore of Anatolia, was a rich ''polis'' that was considered to be greatest Greek metropolis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Colony and Mother City in Ancient Greece|last=Graham|first=A.J|publisher=BiblioBazaar|year=2009|isbn=978-1110286492|location=|pages=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pliny the Elder]], in his book ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]],'' credits Miletus with founding over 90 colonies, including [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinope]] in the Black Sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/25317380|title=Natural history, a selection|last=Elder,|first=Pliny, the|date=1991|publisher=Penguin Books|others=Healy, John F.,|year=|isbn=9780140444131|location=London, England|pages=Section 5.122|oclc=25317380}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sinope itself founded several Greek colonies in the black sea region and flourished in its own right, but the site of Sinope was once a [[Hittites|Hittite]] port called ''Sinuwa'' before being colonized by the Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/505349807|title=The land of the Hittites : an account of recent explorations and discoveries in Asia Minor|last=John.|first=Garstang,|date=2005|publisher=Kegan Paul|year=|isbn=9780710311498|location=London|pages=74|oclc=505349807}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hittite empire, at its height, spanned across Anatolia. The Hittites were a distinct people from the Greeks and contact between the two cultures extended back to the Late Bronze Age during the time of the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean Greeks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/70296530|title=Troy and Homer : towards a solution of an old mystery|last=Joachim.|first=Latacz,|date=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=9780199263080|location=Oxford|pages=60|oclc=70296530}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sinope is an example of an αποικία – apoikia (pl.: αποικίαι, apoikiai), which is a colony that eventually develops into a self-determining city state yet keeps cultural ties with its mother city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/560486473|title=Ancient Greece : from prehistoric to Hellenistic times|last=1947-|first=Martin, Thomas R.,|date=2000|publisher=Yale University Press|year=|isbn=9780300084931|edition=Updated|location=New Haven|pages=56|oclc=560486473}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greek colonies were founded across the Mediterranean and facilitated the [[Hellenization]] of the basin. [[Cicero]], the Roman orator, once made a remark about the extensive colonization movements of the Greeks and spread of their culture by saying “It were as though a Greek fringe has been woven about the shores of the barbarians.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/685531|title=De re publica, De legibus,|last=Tullius.|first=Cicero, Marcus|date=1928|publisher=Harvard University Press|others=Keyes, Clinton Walker, 1888-1943,|year=|isbn=9780674992351|location=Cambridge, Mass.,|pages=Section 2.9|oclc=685531}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rome===
The [[Roman Republic]] and later the [[Roman Empire]] commonly established settler colonies in newly conquered regions.  The colonists were often veterans of the Roman army, who received agricultural land to develop.  These agricultural communities provided bastions of loyal citizens in often hostile areas of the Empire, and often accelerated the process of Romanisation among the nearby conquered peoples. Near the city of [[Damascus]] in present-day [[Syria]], the contemporary settlements of Mezze and Deraya can trace their origins back to villages opened for settlement by the Romans during the third century CE.  [[Philip the Arab]], the Roman Emperor from 244–249, designated this area around Damascus a ''colonia'', and encouraged settlement by veterans of the VI Ferrata legion, as commemorated by coins minted in the city around this time.&lt;ref name="Burns 76, 85"&gt;{{cite book|last=Burns|first=Ross|title=Damascus: a history|publisher=Routledge|pages=76, 85|isbn=978-0-415-27105-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval Eras==
===Japan===
Natives called [[Emishi]] (Tang China: 毛人) in [[Mutsu Province]] lived politically independent yet in constant battle with settlers and conquerors from further south, with Kyoto's victory over them in 802 A.D., after which there was cultural extinction and forced assimilation gradually erasing their culture and ethnicity by the time of the [[Northern Fujiwara]]. 

==In early modern and modern times==
During the [[early modern period]], some European [[nation-states]] and their agents adopted policies of [[colonialism]], competing with each other to establish colonies outside of Europe, at first in the Americas, and later in Asia, Africa, and Oceania.

===In the Americas===
{{further|European colonization of the Americas}}

European colonization of the Americas began as early as the 10th century, when Norse sailors explored and settled limited areas on the shores of present-day Greenland and Canada.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Wolfe 2006&lt;/ref&gt; According to Norse folklore, violent conflicts with the indigenous population ultimately made the Norse abandon those settlements.

Extensive European colonization began in 1492, when a Spanish expedition headed by Genoese Christopher Columbus sailed west to find a new trade route to the Far East but inadvertently landed in the Americas. European conquest, large-scale exploration, colonization and industrial development soon followed. Columbus's first two voyages (1492–93) reached the Bahamas and various Caribbean islands, including Hispaniola, Puerto Rico and Cuba. In 1497, sailing from Bristol on behalf of England, John Cabot landed on the North American coast, and a year later, Columbus's third voyage reached the South American coast. As the sponsor of Christopher Columbus's voyages, Spain was the first European power to settle and colonize the largest areas, from North America and the Caribbean to the southern tip of South America. Spanish cities were founded as early as 1496 with Santo Domingo in today's Dominican Republic.

Other powers such as France also founded colonies in the Americas: in eastern North America, a number of Caribbean islands, and small coastal parts of South America. Portugal colonized Brazil, tried early (since 1499) colonizing of the coasts of present-day Canada, and sat for extended periods on the northwest bank of the River Plate (including it in the Brazilian region). This was the beginning of a dramatic territorial expansion for several European countries. Europe had been preoccupied with internal wars, and was only slowly recovering from the loss of population caused by the bubonic plague; thus the rapid rate at which it grew in wealth and power was unforeseeable in the early 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;"settlercolonialstudies.org"&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, the entire Western Hemisphere came under the ostensible control of European governments, leading to profound changes to its landscape, population, and plant and animal life. In the 19th century alone over 50 million people left Europe for the Americas.&lt;ref name="Burns 76, 85"/&gt; The post-1492 era is known as the period of the [[Columbian Exchange]], a dramatically widespread exchange of animals, plants, culture, human populations (including slaves), communicable disease, and ideas between the Pan-American and Afro-Eurasian hemispheres following Columbus's voyages to the Americas.

===Settler colonialism in the United States===

In the context of the [[United States]], early colonial powers generally respected the territorial and political sovereignty of the indigenous tribes, due to the need to forge local alliances with these tribes against other European colonial powers (i.e. British attempts to check French influence, etc.).{{cn|date=April 2018}} However, with the emergence of an independent United States, desire for land and the perceived threat of permanent indigenous political and spatial structures led to violent relocation of many indigenous tribes to the American West, including the notable example of the Cherokee in what is known as the [[Trail of tears|Trail of Tears]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; While the United States government and local state governments directly aided this dispossession through the use of military forces, ultimately this came about through agitation by settler society in order to gain access to indigenous land, which in some cases (especially in the American South) used in order to build a plantation society and perpetuate the practice of slavery in the creation of said plantation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

This forcible relocation of tribes came about in part through the mentality of ''[[Manifest Destiny]]'', the mentality that it was the right and destiny of the United States to expand its territory and its rule across the North American continent, to the Pacific coast.&lt;ref&gt;The History Channel; ''Manifest Destiny''. http://www.history.com/topics/manifest-destiny&lt;/ref&gt; Through various armed conflicts between indigenous tribes on one side, with settler society backed by American military power on the other side, along with an increasing number of treaties centering around land cessation, Native American tribes were slowly pushed onto a system of [[Indian reservations|reservations]], where they traded territory for protection and support from the United States government.&lt;ref&gt;Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fishing Commission, ''Treaties: Promises between Governments''. http://www.critfc.org/member_tribes_overview/treaty-q-a/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Calloway, Colin G. First Peoples-A Documentary Survey of American Indian History. Boston, MA: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this system could be disadvantageous for tribes, as they often were forced to relocate to reservations far from their traditional homelands, or had trouble obtaining goods and annuity payments that were promised by the government, leading to further armed revolts and conflicts such as the [[Dakota War of 1862]] in [[Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Gary Clayton, and Alan R. Woodworth, eds. Through Dakota Eyes-Narrative Accounts of the Minnesota Indian War of 1862. St. Paul, MN: Minnesota Historical Society Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the conclusion of U.S./Native American [[American Indian Wars|conflicts]] in the late 1800s, displacement of indigenous peoples and identities switched to a more legal basis. Attempts were made to assimilate them into American society while stripping away territory; legislation like the [[Dawes Act]] of 1887 led to the division of previously communally held indigenous lands into individually owned pieces of land that were to be held by tribal members.&lt;ref&gt;Indian Land Tenure Foundation, ''Land Tenure History''. 'https://iltf.org/land-issues/history/&lt;/ref&gt; While 'allotment' was as  mentioned held up as a way to help indigenous people become 'civilized' and further assimilated into settler society, other motives included the erosion of tribal culture and social unity, along with allowing for more land for European-American settlement and economic ventures to make use of indigenous lands.&lt;ref&gt;https://iltf.org/land-issues/history/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Calloway 2008"&gt;Calloway 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In the educational sphere, a system of [[American Indian boarding schools|boarding schools]] for Native children ([[Richard Henry Pratt|Col. Richard Pratt's]] [[Carlisle Indian Industrial School|Carlisle School]] being a notable example) worked to strip indigenous languages, religions and cultures away from children in order for them to better assimilate into American culture, in schools that were often geographically distant from their home reservation.&lt;ref name="Calloway 2008"/&gt;

Further developments such as the Federal policies of [[Indian termination policy|termination]] and [[Indian Relocation Act of 1956|relocation]] in the 1950s and 1960s reinforced the aims of settler society to eliminate indigenous identity and occupation of space, through the disestablishment of Federal treaty/trust obligations to tribes, the transfer of civil and criminal jurisdiction over many reservations to the individual states, and the encouragement of Native Americans to leave their reservations and relocate to cities such as [[New York City]], [[Minneapolis]], [[Denver]] and [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]]; it was hoped that this relocation would further erode tribal identity and speed up the process of assimilation.&lt;ref name="Calloway 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, Nicolas G. "Repositioning Indianness: Native American Organizations in Portland, Oregon, 1959–1975." Pacific Historical Review 71, no. 3 (2002): 415–38.&lt;/ref&gt; While both policies were officially (in the case of termination) and unofficially (relocation) ended by the early 1970s, they had the effect of creating a large population of Native American urban populations, and the unintended side effect of giving rise to increased political awareness among Native Americans, leading to the creation of organizations such as the [[American Indian Movement]] &lt;ref name="Calloway 2008"/&gt;

In the present day, the legacy of settler colonialism in the United States has created a complicated relationship between indigenous tribes and the United States, especially in the area of treaty rights and sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;Fairbanks, Robert. "Native American Sovereignty and Treaty Rights: Are They Historical Illusions?" American Indian Law Review 20.1 (1996): 141–49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freedman, Eric. "When Indigenous Rights and Wilderness Collide: Prosecution of Native Americans for Using Motors in Minnesota's Boundary Waters Canoe Wilderness Area."American Indian Quarterly 26.3 (2002): 378–92&lt;/ref&gt; Much contemporary literature written by indigenous scholars and scholars within the field of American Indian Studies/Native Studies centers around recognising the disruptive effects that settler colonialism has had on Native American tribes, including [[land consumption|land loss]], destruction of tribal languages and cultures, and tribal efforts to maintain recognition of rights they have gained via treaties with the United States government.&lt;ref&gt;Waziyatawin. What Does Justice Look Like?-The Struggle for Liberation in Dakota Homeland. St. Paul, MN: Living Justice Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Audra. Mohawk Interruptus. Durham: Duke UP, 2014. Print&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States has acknowledged its history of [[slavery]], but has not yet publicly dealt with the historic violence of settler colonialism. Although settler colonialism is a racial issue, it cannot be reduced simply to racism, and therefore cannot be solved through inclusion alone. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pulido|first=L|date=2018|title=Geographies of race and ethnicity III: Settler colonialism and nonnative people of color|url=|journal=Progress in Human Geography|volume=42|pages=308–318|via=Ebscohost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Afghanistan===
{{main|Pashtun colonization of northern Afghanistan}}
Starting from the 1880s, various governments of [[Afghanistan]] have pursued policies towards the goal of having more [[ethnic Pashtuns]] (Afghans) settle in northern Afghanistan (especially in [[Afghan Turkestan]]).&lt;ref name="sciencedirect1"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Christian Bleuer |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1879366511000297 |title=State-building, migration and economic development on the frontiers of northern Afghanistan and southern Tajikistan  |date= |accessdate=2016-05-01 |doi=10.1016/j.euras.2011.10.008 |volume=3 |journal=Journal of Eurasian Studies |pages=69–79 |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="afghanistan-analysts1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.afghanistan-analysts.org/from-slavers-to-warlords-descriptions-of-afghanistans-uzbeks-in-western-writing/ |title=From 'Slavers' to 'Warlords': Descriptions of Afghanistan's Uzbeks in western writing &amp;#124; Afghanistan Analysts Network |publisher=Afghanistan-analysts.org |date=2014-10-17 |accessdate=2016-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; These Pashtun colonization policies had three major purposes—to strengthen Afghanistan government's hold on its northern territories, to allow Afghan governments to deport their opponents up north, and to help economically develop northern Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect1"/&gt;

===Nepal===

The native inhabitants of the plains have been the [[Madhesi people|Madheshis]]. However, due to large planned settlement of Hills people by the [[King Mahendra|King Mahendra of Nepal]] after construction of a parallel Highway to the existing [[Postal Highway|Hulaki Rajmarg]], in many places the native population has been reduced to a minority. Overall the demographic change has been such that a 6% population of people of the hills origin in the plains has risen to 36% in between 1951 &amp; 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederick H. Gaige|title=Regionalism and National Unity in Nepal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IxuxAAAAIAAJ|year=1975|publisher=Univ.of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-02728-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vietnam===
{{main|Nam tiến|Central Highlands (Vietnam)|Degar|Champa|Khmer Krom}}

The native inhabitants of the Central Highlands are the [[Degar]] (Montagnard) peoples. Vietnam conquered and invaded the area during its "march to the south" ([[Nam tiến]]). Ethnic [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese (Kinh) people]] now outnumber the indigenous Degars after state sponsored colonization directed by both the government of [[South Vietnam]] and the current Communist government of unified [[Vietnam]]. The Montagnards have fought against and resisted all Vietnamese invaders, from the anti-Communist South Vietnamese government, the Vietcong, to the Communist government of unified Vietnam.

The Montagnard lands in the Central Highlands were subjected to state sponsored colonization by ethnic Vietnamese settlers under the South Vietnamese regime of Ngo Dinh Diem which resulted in estranging the Montagnards and leading them to reject Vietnamese rule.&lt;ref name="FitzGerald2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frances FitzGerald|title=Fire in the Lake|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ld9W1NKBjzQC&amp;pg=PA190|date=30 May 2009|publisher=Little, Brown|isbn=978-0-316-07464-3|page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The South Vietnamese and Communist Vietnamese colonization of the Central Highlands have been compared to the historic Nam tiến of previous Vietnamese rulers. During the Nam tiến (March to the South) Khmer and Cham territory was seized and militarily colonized (đồn điền) by the Vietnamese which was repeated by the state sponsored colonization of Northern Vietnamese Catholic refugees on Montagnard land by the South Vietnamese leader Diem and the introduction to the Central Highlands of "New Economic Zones" by the now Communist Vietnamese government.&lt;ref name="Salemink2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Oscar Salemink|title=The Ethnography of Vietnam's Central Highlanders: A Historical Contextualization, 1850–1990|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2_zKFyHlBk0C&amp;pg=PA151|year=2003|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-2579-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|151-}}

The thousand year violent war the Vietnamese in the lowlands had with the Montagnards in the mountains was a long established custom and the Vietnamese used the derogatory word "Moi" (savages) to address the Montagnards, the South Vietnamese government was strongly against the autonomous Montagnard CIDG (Civilian Irregular Defense Groups) who were fighting against the Vietcong because they feared that the Montagnards would gain independence so the South Vietnamese and Montagnards violently clashed against each other. The Vietnamese Communists implemented harsh punishment against the Montagnards after the defeat of South Vietnam.&lt;ref name="Nutter2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Jacob Nutter|title=The CIA's Black Ops: Covert Action, Foreign Policy, and Democracy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zr58XN0uEEQC&amp;pg=PA160|year=2000|publisher=Prometheus Books, Publishers|isbn=978-1-61592-397-7|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vietnamese viewed and dealt with the indigenous Montagnards in the CIDG from the Central Highlands as "savages" and this caused a Montagnard uprising against the Vietnamese.&lt;ref name="Cosmas"&gt;{{cite book|author=Graham A. Cosmas|title=MACV: The Joint Command in the Years of Escalation, 1962–1967|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZcLQcquYkcIC&amp;pg=PA145|publisher=Government Printing Office|isbn=978-0-16-072367-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|145}}

The Montagnard Rhades mounted a revolt, seizing hundreds of Vietnamese civilians and soldiers, assassinating officers of the Vietnamese special forces and seizing American advisers on 19–20 September but the 23rd Division of the South Vietnamese army stopped them from sizing Ban Me Thout, the provincial capital of Darlac Province.&lt;ref name="Cosmas" /&gt;{{rp|146}}

The South Vietnamese and Communists "victimized" the Montagnards.&lt;ref name="Hellmann2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Hellmann|title=American Myth and the Legacy of Vietnam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uPH86IxSwjsC&amp;pg=PA62|date=13 August 2013|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-51538-2|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Central Highlands the Montagnard FULRO organization fought against both the Communists and South Vietnamese due to discrimination by the South Vietnamese army against the Montagnards. After the victory of the Communist North Vietnamese, the Vietnamese refused autonomy to the Montagnards, and on Montagnard land they settled around one million ethnic Vietnamese in addition to using "reducation camps" on the Montagnards, leading the Montagnard FULRO to continue the armed struggle against the Vietnamese.&lt;ref name="Tucker2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Spencer C.

The Vietnamese were originally centered around the Red River Delta but engaged in conquest and seized new lands such as Champa, the Mekong Delta (from Cambodia)  and the Central Highlands during Nam Tien, while the Vietnamese received strong Chinese influence in their culture and civilization and were Simonized, and the Cambodians and Laotians were Indianized, the Montagnards in the Central Highlands maintained their own native culture without adopting external culture and were the true indigenous natives of the region, and to hinder encroachment on the Central Highlands by Vietnamese nationalists, the term ''Pays Montagnard du Sud-Indochinois'' PMSI emerged for the Central Highlands along with the natives being addressed by the name Montagnard.&lt;ref name="Salemink2003" /&gt;{{rp|28-}} The tremendous scale of Vietnamese Kinh colonists flooding into the Central Highlands has significantly altered the demographics of the region.&lt;ref name="Salemink2003" /&gt;{{rp|29-}}

Up until French rule, the Central Highlands was almost never entered by the Vietnamese since they viewed it as a savage (Moi-Montaganrd) populated area with fierce animals like tigers, "poisoned water" and "evil malevolent spirits", but the Vietnamese became greedy and voracious for the land after the French transformed it into a profitable plantation area to grow crops on,&lt;ref name="M.D.2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lawrence H.

The anti-ethnic minority discriminatory policies by the Vietnamese, environmental degradation, deprivation of lands from the natives, and settlement of native lands by a massive amount of Vietnamese settlers led to massive protests and demonstrations by the Central Highland's indigenous native ethnic minorities against the Vietnamese in January–February 2001 and this event gave a tremendous blow to the claim often published by the Vietnamese government that in Vietnam ''There has been no ethnic confrontation, no religious war, no ethnic conflict.

Most of the highlands like the Annamite Range and the [[Central Highlands (Vietnam)|Central Highlands]] were populated by ethnic minorities who were not Vietnamese during the 20th century's start, but the demographics of the highlands was drastically transformed with the mass colonization of 6 million settlers from 1976 to the 1990s, which led to ethnic Vietnamese Kinh outnumbering the native ethnic groups in the highlands.

The native peoples of Mindanao are the [[Moro people|Moro Muslims]] and the [[Lumad people|Lumad]] Animists. They have been turned into a minority by the settlement of millions of Filipino Christians from Luzon and the Visayas onto their land.

At the beginning of the 20th century, the Moro and Lumads controlled an area which now covers 17 of Mindanao's 24 provinces, but by the 1980 census, they constituted less than 6% of the population of Mindanao and [[Sulu Province|Sulu]]. Heavy migration to Mindanao of Luzon and [[Visayan people|Visayans]], spurred by government-sponsored resettlement programs,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.davaotoday.com/main/todays-views/we-who-seek-to-settle-part-9/&lt;/ref&gt; turned the indigenous Lumads and Moros into minorities.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.hawaii.edu/cps/identity.html Islam and the Politics of Identity]". University of Hawaii&amp;nbsp;– Center for Philippine Studies.&lt;/ref&gt;

The native Moro Muslims and Lumads were supplanted by the first Spanish and American colonization programs with Christian settlers taking control of key areas and disrupting the Muslim's administrative structures and control over resources, the Americans chose Christian settlers to become officials of settler populated townships instead of Lumads and Muslims, with the environment becoming ruined due to the activities of the settlers and logging.&lt;ref name="UmeharaBautista2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hiromitsu Umehara|author2=Germelino M.

The Americans started a colonization program on Mindanao for foreign agricultural companies and Filipino Christian settlers against the native Muslims and non-Muslim Lumads of Mindanao, in order to secure the area with a Christian presence and help the American military assert control over the area once it was conquered.&lt;ref name="Franco2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jennifer Conroy Franco|title=Elections and Democratization in the Philippines|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fAq9kgbKBAUC&amp;pg=PA221|year=2001|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-8153-3734-8|page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

90% of Mindanao's people used to consist of native Moro Muslims at the start of the 20th century but the invasion and colonization sponsored by the American and Philippine governments led to Filipino Christian settlers turning into the majority of almost 75% of the population, with the American colonial government helping to kick natives off their land and giving the land titles to Christian colonists.&lt;ref name="(Organization)1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=Human Rights Watch (Organization)|title=Bad Blood: Militia Abuses in Mindanao, the Philippines|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KbGdZCZc8ewC&amp;pg=PA17|year=1992|publisher=Human Rights Watch|isbn=978-1-56432-060-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|17}} Media compared the American conquest of the west from the Native Americans to the Filipino conquest and settlement of Mindanao from the Muslims, the Philippine government, Philippine military and Filipino militias used extremely violent tactics against natives to support the settlers.&lt;ref name="(Organization)1992" /&gt;{{rp|18-}}

The government agencies involved in settlement on Mindanao were the National Land Settlement Administration (NLSA) and subsequently the Land Settlement and Development Corporation (LASEDECO), followed by the National Resettlement and Rehabilitation Administration (NARRA).&lt;ref name="DaiTai1974"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hongchao Dai|author2=Hung-chao Tai|title=Land Reform and Politics: A Comparative Analysis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SjtJnkkaus8C&amp;pg=PA259|date=1 January 1974|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-02337-6|page=259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Americans used their control over property and land laws to let American corporations and Filipino Christian settlers take over Lumad and Moro Muslim resources and land and depriving them of self-governance after eliminating the sovereignty of the Moro Sultanates, and ignoring Moro requests for their own independence, with the Philippine government continuing the colonization program after independence leading to a humongous number of Filipino settlers streaming into Moro territories, and this led to Moros making moves for independence and armed struggle against the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kamlian|first1=Jamail A.|title=Who are the Moro people?|url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/39098/who-are-the-moro-people|accessdate=29 June 2015|agency=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1960 the settlement program turned the Moro Muslims into a minority from their previous majority in Mindanao, similar to what happened in the Indonesian [[Transmigration program]] where frontier areas are settled with ethnic Madurese and Javanese people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Magdalena|first1=Federico V.|title=Islam and the Politics of Identity|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/cps/identity.html|website=University of Hawai'i at Manoā|publisher=Center for Philippine Studies|accessdate=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moro Muslims are just 17% of Mindanao's population whereas prior to the colonization program initiated by the governments of the Philippines they had been a massive majority and the colonization and land grabs led to the current violent conflict, with private companies and Filipino colonists from the Visayas and Luzon taking lands from Moro clans with the Philippine government issuing land titles to settlers and ignoring Moro ownership of the land since they declared Moro land as public lands.&lt;ref name="Rabasa2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Angel Rabasa|title=Ungoverned Territories: Understanding and Reducing Terrorism Risks|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=faWMHiaaLgkC&amp;pg=PA126|year=2007|publisher=Rand Corporation|isbn=978-0-8330-4152-4|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Massive settlement by Filipino Christian colonists continued after independence was granted and rule passed to Christian Filipinos from the Americans and land disputes the Christian settlers had with the Muslim and tribal natives broke out in violence, eventually the colonization, along with the [[Jabidah massacre]], led to the formation of the [[Moro National Liberation Front]] and Moro armed insurgency against Philippine rule.&lt;ref name="MackerrasMackerras2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Colin Mackerras|author2=Foundation Professor in the School of Asian and International Studies Colin Mackerras|title=Ethnicity in Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mi6DAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA143|date=2 September 2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-51517-2|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mackerras2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Colin Mackerras|title=Ethnicity in Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QLKpECdc4eIC&amp;pg=PA143|date=18 June 2004|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-203-38046-8|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Philippine government encouraged Filipino Christian settlers in Mindanao to form militias called [[Ilaga]] to fight the Moros. The Ilaga engaged in massacres and atrocities and were responsible for [[Manili massacre]] of 65 Moro Muslim civilians in a Mosque on June 1971, including women and children. The Ilaga also engaged in cannibalism, cutting off the body parts of their victims to eat in rituals. The Ilaga settlers were given the sarcastic nickname as an acronym, the "Ilonggo Land Grabbers' Association".&lt;ref&gt;http://pcij.org/blog/2015/03/07/ph-souths-separatist-armed-groups&lt;/ref&gt;

The Moros were only incorporated into the Philippines by "conquest and colonization", constituting a separate nation from Filipinos analogous to the experience of Native Americans who violently resisted American conquest.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bworldonline.com/content.php?section=Opinion&amp;title=should-there-be-a-moro-nation&amp;id=103716&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lorenzo Veracini]] describes Israel as a colonial state and writes that Jewish settlers could expel the British in 1948 only because they had their own colonial relationships inside and outside Israel's new borders.&lt;ref&gt;"Israel could celebrate its anticolonial/anti-British struggle exactly [http://www.borderlands.net.au/vol6no2_2007/veracini_settler.htm because it was able to establish a number of colonial relationships within and without the borders of 1948."] Lorenzo Veracini, Borderlands, vol 6 No 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Veracini believes the possibility of an Israeli disengagement is always latent and this relationship could be severed, through an "[[One state solution|accommodation of a Palestinian Israeli autonomy within the institutions of the Israeli state]]" (Veracini 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Veracini, Lorenzo, "Israel and Settler Society", London: Pluto Press. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Other commentators, such as [[Daiva Stasiulis]], [[Nira Yuval-Davis]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Unsettling-Settler-Societies/Daiva-K-Stasiulis/e/9780803986947 Unsettling Settler Societies: Articulations of Gender, Race, Ethnicity and Class, Vol. 11], Nira Yuval-Davis (Editor), Daiva K Stasiulis (Editor), Paperback 352pp, {{ISBN|978-0-8039-8694-7}}, August 1995 SAGE Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Joseph Massad]] in the "Post Colonial Colony: time, space and bodies in Palestine/ Israel in the persistence of the Palestinian Question"&lt;ref&gt;"Post Colonial Colony: time, space and bodies in Palestine/ Israel in the persistence of the Palestinian Question", Routledge, NY, (2006) and "The Pre-Occupation of Post-Colonial Studies" ed.

[[Ilan Pappé]] describes Zionism and Israel in similar terms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kingsreview.co.uk/articles/the-palestinian-enclaves-struggle-an-interview-with-ilan-pappe/ The Palestinian Enclaves Struggle: An Interview with Ilan Pappé], King's Review – Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Video: [https://www.antiwar.com/blog/2017/04/05/ilan-pappe-on-viewing-israel-palestine-through-the-lens-of-settler-colonialism/ Decolonizing Israel.

[[Antiwar.com]], 5 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar Amal Jamal, from [[Tel Aviv University]], has stated, "Israel was created by a settler-colonial movement of Jewish immigrants".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Amal Jamal|title=Arab Minority Nationalism in Israel: The Politics of Indigeneity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pWLCpqnsoLQC&amp;pg=PA48|year=2011|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-136-82412-8|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Palestinians]] express similar opinions - writer and [[sociologist]] [[Jamil Hilal]], member of the [[Palestinian National Council]] lives in what he describes as "the heavily-colonised [[West Bank]]", and drew parallels in 1976 between South African and Israeli settler colonialism, writes that "as in [[Southern Africa]], stretches of land were acquired by the Zionist settlers [...] and their [[Arab]] tenants thrown out".&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.lib.msu.edu/DMC/African%20Journals/pdfs/Utafiti/vol1no1/aejp001001004.pdf "IMPERIALISM AND SETTLER-COLONIALISM IN WEST ASIA: ISRAEL AND THE ARAB PALESTINIAN STRUGGLE."] Jamil Hilal, UTAFITI journal of the arts and social sciences, University of Dar Es Salaam. 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; Former Palestinian Foreign Minister Dr. Nasser al-Qidwa opposes the policy of [[Israeli settlements]] and has described those efforts as colonialism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jmcc.org/debate/06/nov/nasserqidwa.htm "a classical colonialist phenomenon"] Speech: Dr. Nasser al-Qidwa, former Palestinian Foreign Minister, Jerusalem Media &amp; Communication Centre, November 2006.
&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a report by the [[Foundation for Middle East Peace|FMEP]] issued in 2000, the settler population in the West Bank and Gaza strip grew from approximately 1,500 in 1972 to approximately 73,000 in 1989, and more than doubled that in 1998 to approximately 169,000. The report also describes demographics statistics indicating that, by place of birth, 78% of Israeli settlers in the West Bank and Gaza were from Europe or America, 19% from Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fmep.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/10.4.pdf  Report on Israeli Settlement in the Occupied Territories], FMEP, Volume 10, Number 4; July–August 2000, pp.10, 12&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2015 the Israeli Interior Ministry gave figures of 389,250 Israelis living in the West Bank and a further 375,000 Israelis living in East Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jewish Population in Judea &amp; Samaria Growing Significantly |url=http://www.breakingisraelnews.com/26966/jewish-population-in-judea-and-samaria-growing-significantly/#DpRV1c2O5HHhPB67.97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of scholars have objected to the idea that Zionism and the State of Israel are tantamount to settler colonialism. Avi Bareli, in his essay 'Forgetting Europe: Perspectives on the Debate about Zionism and Colonialism', argues that the "Colonialist School offered this alternative interpretation to replace the account of the return of the Jewish people to its land". Moreover, he asserts that it "ignores the economic, social, and cultural processes that spurred the Jews in Eastern Europe to emigrate to Palestine over decades in the twentieth century".&lt;ref&gt;Bareli, Israeli Historical Revisionism: From Left to Right, pp. 99–100&lt;/ref&gt; Arnon Golan contends that "Zionism was not imperialist or colonialist in nature, but a national liberation movement that developed in eastern and central Europe, in conjunction with other national liberation movements in these regions" and that "Zionism was a diaspora national movement that aspired to promote its interests in the destined homeland through becoming a collaborator of imperial powers."&lt;ref&gt;Arnon, Space and Polity, p. 140-141&lt;/ref&gt; S. Ilan Troen, in 'De-Judaizing the Homeland: Academic Politics in Rewriting the History of Palestine', argues that Zionism was the repatriation of a long displaced indigenous population to their historic homeland, and that "Zionists did not see themselves as foreigners or conquerors, for centuries in the Diaspora they had been strangers". Troen further argues that there are several differences between European colonialism and the Zionist movement, including that "there is no New Vilna, New Bialystock, New Warsaw, New England, New York,...and so on" in Israel. He writes that "mandates were intended to nurture the formation of new states until independence and this instrument was to be applied to Jews, even as it was for the Arab peoples of Syria and Iraq. In this view, Jews were a people not only entitled to a state but that polity was naturally located in a part of the world in which they had originated, had been resident since the ancient world, and still constituted a vital presence in many areas of the region, including Palestine" and that "perhaps the most manifest or visible evidence—for those who would be willing to acknowledge—were found in the revival of Hebrew into a living language; the marking the landscape with a Jewish identity; and the development of an indigenous culture with roots in the ancient past." He concludes that "casting Zionists as colonizers serves to present them as occupiers in a land to which, by definition, they do not belong."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/13537120701445372 | volume=13 | issue=4 | title=De-Judaizing the Homeland: Academic Politics in Rewriting the History of Palestine | year=2007 | journal=Israel Affairs | pages=872–884 | last1 = Troen | first1 = S.

'''Skills Development Scotland''' (SDS) is the national skills agency of Scotland. It is an [[executive non-departmental public body]] of the [[Scottish Government]].

==History==
Created on 1 April 2008, SDS is a merger of former organisations and services which delivered skills related services across Scotland.

The former organisations or services that now make up SDS are:

*  Careers Scotland
*  Elements of [[Scottish Enterprise]]'s skills function
*  Elements of [[Highlands &amp; Islands Enterprise]]'s skills function
*  Scottish University for Industry (learndirect Scotland, learndirect Scotland for business, ILA Scotland and [[#The Big Plus|The Big Plus]])
*  Training for Work
*  Skillseekers
*  Modern Apprenticeships

In 2010, the agency found itself facing funding cuts of more than £20{{nbsp}}million and needing to find 125 voluntary redundancies, one tenth of its workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-12016425 |title=Redundancies at Skills Development Scotland |work=[[BBC News]] |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=17 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
Skills Development Scotland has a presence in most major towns across Scotland.

==The Big Plus==
The Big Plus is an awareness raising campaign in [[Scotland]] targeting adults who might be unable to achieve their aspirations due to a lack of literacy and/or numeracy skills. Formerly part of the Scottish University for Industry, it is now part of Skills Development Scotland.

Adults who respond to the media promotion are put in touch with a local learning provider where they are invited to participate in a program of personal, dedicated learning activities at a local centre. The program aims to help participants reach a level of skills that will enable them to actively engage, with confidence, in personal, family, community and work life. Learning programs are provided by Scottish [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local authorities]] and are free to resident applicants.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16611">'''Slavic studies''' (North America), '''Slavonic studies''' (Britain and Ireland) or '''Slavistics''' (borrowed from Russian ''славистика'' or Polish ''slawistyka'') is the [[academic field]] of [[area studies]] concerned with [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] areas, [[Slavic languages]], literature, history, and culture. Originally, a Slavist (from Russian ''славист'' or Polish ''slawista'') or Slavicist was primarily a [[linguistics|linguist]] or [[philologist]] researching Slavistics, a Slavic ([[AmE]]) or Slavonic ([[BrE]]) scholar. Increasingly historians and other humanists and social scientists who study Slavic area cultures and societies have been included in this rubric.

In North America, Slavic studies are dominated by [[Russian studies]]; [[Ewa Thompson]] describes the situation of non-Russian Slavic studies as ''Invisible and Mute''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/15174232/Slavic_but_not_Russian_Invisible_and_Mute E. Thompson, ''Slavic but not Russian: Invisible and Mute'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--[[New York University]] has a ''Department of Russian and Slavic Studies'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.russianslavic.as.nyu.edu/page/home|title=Russian and Slavic Studies|author=|date=|website=www.russianslavic.as.nyu.edu|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in Fall 2016 taught almost exclusively Russian (only one course in Czech).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.russianslavic.as.nyu.edu/object/courses.fall.2016.slavic|title=Russian and Slavic Studies|author=|date=|website=www.russianslavic.as.nyu.edu|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

==History==
Slavistics emerged in late 18th and early 19th century, simultaneously with [[Romantic nationalism|national revival]]s among various [[Slavic peoples|nations of Slavic origins]] and with ideological attempts to establish a common sense of Slavic community, exemplified by the [[Pan-Slavism|Pan-Slavist movement]]. Among the first scholars to use the term was [[Josef Dobrovský]] (1753-1829).

The history of Slavic studies is generally divided into three periods. Until 1876 the early Slavists concentrated on documentation and printing of monuments of Slavic languages, among them the first texts written in national languages. At this time the majority of Slavic languages received their first modern [[dictionary|dictionaries]], grammars and compendia. The second period, ending with [[World War I]], featured the rapid development of Slavic [[philology]] and [[linguistics]], most notably outside of Slavic countries themselves, in the circle formed around [[August Schleicher]] (1821-1868) and around [[August Leskien]] (1840-1916) at the [[University of Leipzig]].

After [[World War I]] Slavic studies scholars focused on [[dialectology]], while the science continued to develop in countries with large populations having Slavic origins. After [[World War II]] there developed centres of Slavic studies, and much greater expansion into other humanities and social science disciplines in various universities around the world. Indeed, partly due to the political concerns in Western European and the United States about the Slavic world nurtured by the [[Cold War]], Slavic studies flourished in the years from World War II into the 1990s and remain strong,{{cn|date=May 2018}} though university enrollments in Slavic languages have declined since the 1990s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2016">'''Societal innovation''' refers to a systemic change in the interplay of the [[Sovereign state|state]] and [[civil society]]. It is a relative of [[social innovation]], but differs from it by considering the state to be an important co-creator in achieving [[sustainable]] systemic change. In this sense, the term's origins lie beyond the traditional anglosaxon understanding for the concept of [[social innovation]]. 

The term has been used in research, see e.g.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Cova, Christian Svanfeldt, Societal innovations and the postmodern aestheticization of everyday life, International Journal of Research in Marketing, Volume 10, Issue 3, August 1993, Pages 297-310, ISSN 0167-8116, 10.1016/0167-8116(93)90012-N.
[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016781169390012N link]&lt;/ref&gt;
,&lt;ref&gt;Societal Innovation: between dream and reality lies complexity,
J Rotmans (2005), [http://repub.eur.nl/res/pub/7293/EIA-2005-026-ORG%209058921050%20ROTMANS.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;
but also in some official reports and documents of the European Union, where societal innovation is considered as an answer to societal challenges. A formal definition exists 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lehtola|first=Ville V.|author2=Ståhle, Pirjo|title=Societal innovation at the interface of the state and civil society|journal=Innovation: The European Journal of Social Science Research|date=15 January 2014|pages=1–23|doi=10.1080/13511610.2014.863995}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''A societal innovation introduces a novel economic and/or social improvement to people’s''
''everyday life. It brings a (radical or incremental) systemic change to society’s structures or''
''modes of operation, and it is legitimated by the majority of societal stakeholders.''

'''''The Executioner''''' is a monthly men's [[adventure novel|action-adventure]] series following the exploits of the character [[Mack Bolan]] and his wars against organized crime and international terrorism. The series spans #453 installments (as of December 2017) and has sold more than 200 million copies since its debut installment, ''War Against the Mafia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE4D71E3CF93BA15753C1A963958260 |title=Don Pendleton, 67, Writer Who Spawned a Genre |work=New York Times |author=Robert Thomas Jr.|accessdate=May 5, 2014 | date=October 28, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was created and initially written by [[United States|American]] author [[Don Pendleton]], who penned 37 of the original 38 Bolan novels. In 1980, Pendleton licensed the rights to [[Harlequin Enterprises|Gold Eagle]] and was succeeded by a [[Mack_Bolan#Authors|collective of ghostwriter]]s.

Since its inception in 1969, The Executioner series has spawned [[Mack Bolan#Mack Bolan books|several spin-off series]] including: [[Able Team]], [[Phoenix Force]], and [[Stony Man]] (the series into which Able Team and Phoenix Force were eventually merged). Every other month, the Executioner series is complimented by the release of a [[Super Bolan]], whose titles are twice the length of a standard Executioner novel.

==Background==

Mack Bolan is a [[Vietnam War]] veteran serving as a sniper. It is in these jungles where the young Bolan honed his military capabilities and his deadly accuracy. His 97 confirmed kills gave birth to the nickname he would carry for the rest of his life: The Executioner. Amidst the chaos of war, Bolan also earned the moniker "Sergeant Mercy", for his compassion and willingness to help innocent Vietnamese citizens put in harm's way or wounded by the conflict around them.

During his tour of duty, Bolan was called home on emergency leave to bury his family, who were killed by their father, Sam Bolan, in a triple-murder/suicide. Upon his return home, Bolan learned loan sharks from a local branch of the ''[[American Mafia|Mafia]]'' [[Crime family|"family"]] had forced his sister Cynthia into a life of prostitution to pay back the family debt. Upon learning the news, his father could not bear it and committed the horrendous act. Only Bolan's 14-year-old brother Johnny survived his wounds.

Bolan realized that the real enemy was not in the jungles of Vietnam, but at home. The Mafia's schemes affected everyday innocent civilians such as his own family. Using the tactics he learned during his military combat, Bolan refused to return to Vietnam and instead took his war to the Mafia. City by city, he strikes ruthlessly to bring down the mafia and to clean the country of this horrific criminal organization. His actions would 
divide opinions. Some government and law enforcement officials were pleased with his efforts, while some sought to bring his war to an end.

In the end, the government offered Bolan amnesty under the condition he work for them. Bolan accepted and emerged under the name Colonel John Phoenix beginning his war against terrorism and the KGB.&lt;ref&gt;#39: The New War by Saul Wernick&lt;/ref&gt; Bolan works in conjunction with Hal Brognola, the Director of the Sensitive Operations Group and the liaison between Bolan and the Oval Office. Phoenix was chosen to be Bolan's new alias in reference to the mythological bird that would resurrect itself from the ashes of a former life, just as Bolan had done after the events of Executioner #38, Satan's Sabbath.

==Spinoff series==
In the Mack Bolan universe there are two covert tactical neutralization teams assigned to Stony Man but which work separately from it: Able Team and Phoenix Force. Each had its own series of books until 1991, when Gold Eagle combined both series into one, [[Stony Man]]. In addition, the SuperBolan series emerged in 1985. These books are double the size of a regular Executioner title and are released every other month.

In France, a new spin-off series, Kira B., featuring Mack Bolan's "daughter" Kira, was introduced by the publisher [[Vauvenargues (publisher)|Vauvenargues]], in 2012. Written under the pen name Steven Belly, the series follows the adventures of Kira, a young woman who appeared in ''L'Exécuteur nº300: Le réseau Phénix'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pendleton, Don|date=August 2012|publisher=    Exécuteur|isbn=    9782744318528|language=    French|title=L'Exécuteur nº300: Le réseau Phénix}}&lt;/ref&gt; where she manipulated Mack Bolan to come out of retirement to fight against cyber-criminals. Since then, she has helped her "father" in his fight against crime and now is the heroine of her own, eponymous series.

==''The Executioner Mystery Magazine''==
In 1975, [[Leonard J. Ackerman]] Productions produced ''Don Pendleton's The Executioner Mystery Magazine'', a [[digest-sized]], [[pulp magazine]] anthology series along the same lines as the ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Mystery Magazine]]''. The magazine had little connection to the Mack Bolan books save for the occasional story related to the Mafia. The magazine ran for only four issues, ending in August 1975, with the final issue titled simply ''The Executioner Mystery Magazine''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philsp.com/data/data097.html#DONPENDLETONSTHEEXECUTIONERMYSTERYMAGAZINE|title=Magazine Data File|work=philsp.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other media==

===Movie screenplay===
[[Joseph E. Levine]] contracted [[Richard Maibaum]] in 1972 to write a screenplay, based on the fifth and sixth volumes, ''Continental Contract''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lib.uiowa.edu/spec-coll/Msc/ToMsc150/MsC149/MsC149.html&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Assault on Soho''.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Anthony Kraft|Kraft, David Anthony]], "The Executioner Speaks Out!" (interview with Don Pendleton), ''[[Marvel Preview]]'', #2, 1975, [[Marvel Comics]].&lt;/ref&gt; A later attempt to adapt ''The Executioner'' to the screen by [[Burt Reynolds]] was to star [[Sylvester Stallone]] and [[Cynthia Rothrock]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hkmania.com/from.php?fromurl=http://www.hkmania.com/Dossiers/cynthiarothrockeng.html Hk Mania - Le site des fans de cinéma asiatique]&lt;/ref&gt; but the production was scrapped.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.speakeasy.org/~swmpthng/StonyMan.html The Stony Man Farm]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was announced August 2014, that [[Shane Salerno]], Hollywood producer, screenwriter has acquired the Executioner Mack Bolan Series of action/adventure novels for a film franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deadline.com/2014/08/after-40-years-of-trying-with-mcqueen-stallone-eastwood-reynolds-and-vin-diesel-mack-bolan-pic-is-back-818357/#respond/|title=After 40 Years Of Trying With McQueen, Stallone, Eastwood, Reynolds And Vin Diesel, Mack Bolan Pic Is Back | last=Fleming, Jr.|first=Mike|work=Deadline|date=August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deadline reports that [[Warner Bros.]] has acquired the film rights of the Book series with [[Bradley Cooper]] starring as Bolan, [[Shane Salerno]] writing and [[Todd Phillips]] directing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2014/08/warner-bros-mack-bolan-bradley-cooper-todd-phillips-821368/|title=Warner Bros Pre-empts ‘Mack Bolan'; Bradley Cooper, Todd Phillips Aboard|last=Fleming, Jr.|first=Mike|work=Deadline|date=August 18, 2014|accessdate=August 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comics===
''The Executioner: War Against the Mafia'' was a comic book adaptation of the first novel by Don Pendleton and Linda Pendleton, published 1993 by Innovation Comics.  Intended to run four issues, the final instalment was not published due to Innovation closing. Artwork was by Sandu Florea.

''The Executioner: Death Squad'' was adapted by Linda Pendleton with art by Sandu Florea.  It was a 128-page black and white comic, published in 1996 by Vivid Comics.

''The Executioner'' was adapted into a five-part comic book series by IDW, written by Doug Wojtowicz and illustrated by S. I. Gallant. It was reissued as the graphic novel, ''Don Pendleton's The Executioner: The Devil's Tool'', in November 2008.  The reissued version contained an introduction by Linda Pendleton, "Don Pendleton's Creation of Mack Bolan, The Executioner".

==Works inspired by the Executioner series==

The Executioner is often cited as the inspiration for the Marvel Comics character [[Punisher|The Punisher]], who also fights the Mafia, as well as [[James Glickenhaus]]' films ''[[The Exterminator]]'' (1980) and ''[[Exterminator 2]]'' (1984).

{{refimprove|date=December 2009}}

'''Trash-talk''' is a form of insult usually found in sports events, although it is not exclusive to just sports or similarly characterized events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/trash_talk|title=trash talk - Definition of trash talk in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often used to intimidate the opposition, but can also be used in a [[Humour|humorous]] spirit. Trash-talk is often characterized by use of [[hyperbole]] or figurative language, such as, "Your team can't run! You run like honey on ice!" [[Pun]]s and other wordplay are commonly used.

Trash-talk was commonly used by the [[heavyweight]] [[boxing]] champion [[Muhammad Ali]] in the 1960s and 70s. In 1963, Ali even released a popular full-length record album consisting largely of trash-talk poetry. It was entitled ''[[I Am the Greatest (Cassius Clay album)|I Am the Greatest!]]'', a phrase that became his signature line. Since then, it has become common for boxers, [[Wrestling|wrestlers]], and many other sports competitors to use trash-talk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= Derrick Z. |last= Jackson | url= http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2010/02/02/the_kings_of_trash_talk/ |title= The kings of trash talk| website= Boston.com| publisher= ''Boston Globe'', Globe Newspaper Company| date= February 2, 2010| accessdate= March 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in amateur sports ranks, trash talking is generally frowned upon as [[unsportsmanlike conduct]] (especially in youth leagues). UFC Lightweight Champion [[Conor McGregor]] is a more recent example of a prominent trash-talker, while former [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] fighter [[Chael Sonnen]] is considered by some to be the greatest trash talker in [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/articles/11/Sherdogs-Top-10-Trash-Talkers-86017|title=Sherdog’s Top 10: Trash Talkers - Number 1|last=Sherdog.com|website=Sherdog|access-date=2017-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the practice of trying to distract opponents by verbal abuse is common to virtually all sports, other sports sometimes have their own terminology for verbal abuse: for example, [[cricket]] calls it [[sledging (cricket)|sledging]] and in ice hockey it is called chirping. Down Gaelic footballer Brendan Coulter has admitted to being targeted by sledging while on the field of play.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} [[The Wealdstone Raider]], a notorious fan hailing from Wealdstone, is known for trash-talking the opposition and opposition's fans.

==Smack talk==
{{Wiktionary|talk smack}}
'''Smack talk''' is a [[slang]] term seen in chat channels in [[chat room]], [[blog]], and [[massively multiplayer online game]] (MMOG) conversations. The term came about in the early 1990s.  It generally refers to the use of threatening or intentionally inflammatory language. Smack talk can also be used with [[bullying]], whether that be [[face-to-face interaction]], or [[cyber-bullying]].

Smack talk is also a [[slang]] term used in [[sport]]s. It refers to inflammatory comments made by a person or team in order to insult, anger, annoy or be boisterous towards your opponents. Although it began as a term used by sports fans and athletes, it has spread to all areas of culture where competition takes place. In the [[United States of America|United States]], it is synonymous with "trash talk".

The social interaction within MMOGs has been observed to be quite active and often leads to long-term social relationships.&lt;ref&gt;''Social interactions in massively multiplayer online role-playing gamers'', CyberPsychology and Behavior, Volume 10, pp. 575-583, H. Cole and Griffiths, MD., 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  MMOG groups, such as "teams", "guilds" or "corporations", are composed of groups of people who often initially have no other social contact or interactions with each other.&lt;ref&gt;''Study: Want to Make a Friend for Life? Play an MMORPG'', James Brightman, August 15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, their conversations contain a subtext of discovery of language skills, social values, and intentions.  One of the first indicators of these is the use or offense taken by the usage of smack talk.  For the purpose of setting a social context or to comply with MMOG [[end user license agreement]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/legal/eula.html|title=Blizzard Entertainment:Blizzard Legal Documentation|website=www.worldofwarcraft.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; restrictions, MMOG groups may establish bylaws, traditions, or rules (formal or informal) that either permit, discourage, or prohibit the use of smack talk in their conversations and postings.

'''Unicron''' is a fictional character from the many continuities in the [[Transformers|''Transformers'' universe]] and [[Transformers (toyline)|toyline]]. Created by [[Floro Dery]], he was introduced in the 1986 animated film ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= A brief history of the Transformers|work= Malaysia Star|url= http://thestar.com.my/lifestyle/story.asp?file=/2004/11/9/features/20041108160036&amp;sec=features|accessdate=2010-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has since reappeared in ''[[Transformers: Armada]]'', ''[[Transformers: Energon]]'', ''[[Transformers: Cybertron]]'', ''[[Transformers: Prime]]'', ''[[Transformers: The Last Knight]]'' and [[Atari]]'s 2004 [[Transformers (2004 video game)|''Transformers'' video game]]. Unicron is a prodigiously large robot whose scale reaches planetary proportions, and he is also able to transform into a mechanical [[planet]]. Unicron's origin has expanded over the years from simply being a large robot to being a god of chaos who devours realities. He often employs the help of [[Decepticon]]s in his work, and in some stories is considered part of the origin of the Decepticon forces.

==Fictional character biography==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
According to the Transformers lore, before the dawn of time, Order and Chaos exist within an extra-dimensional entity known as The One. To explore the fledgling universe, he creates the astral being known as Unicron, and then subdivides him, creating his twin, [[Primus (Transformers)|Primus]]. Both brothers are multiversal singularities, unique in all realities, but whereas Unicron can only exist in one universe at a time, moving freely between them at will, Primus exists simultaneously in all realities at once.

As Unicron and Primus venture through the cosmos, it becomes apparent to Primus that Unicron is nothing but a purely corrupt being, and so confronts the threat his sibling poses. In combat, Primus is no match for Unicron; in cunning, he proves himself to be his brother's superior when he shifts their battle to the astral plane, and then back to the physical world, sacrificing most of his strength to manifest their essences within metallic planetoids and leaving them both trapped in the planet prison. Primus hopes to contain the evil force forever. Unfortunately, over time, Unicron learns to physically shape his prison into a giant metallic planet, and Primus emulates his brother. The Primus planet becomes the mechanical world of [[Cybertron]]. When Unicron learns to transform his planetary form even further, into a gigantic robot form, Primus adapts the idea, and creates [[Thirteen Primes|The Thirteen]], a group of robotic beings that possessed the ability to change shape.

The war between Unicron and Primus comes to its seeming end during a climactic battle in which one of the Thirteen, Megatronus Prime, who is afterwards known as [[Fallen (Transformers)|The Fallen]], betrays Primus and becomes an acolyte of Unicron. The battle ends when the Fallen and Unicron are sucked into a [[black hole]] and disappear. With Unicron gone, Primus enters an eons-long slumber, preventing Unicron from detecting him through the mental link the brothers share.
 
===Later retconning===
{{further|retconning}}
The Primus/Unicron backstory has evolved and been rewritten a number of times since it originated in the [[Marvel Comics]] series. The version recounted above is the current iteration, which has slowly solidified across a wide swath of media (beginning around the time of ''[[Transformers: Armada]]''). Before the Primus/Unicron mythos reached its present form, it went through several distinct versions in the Marvel Generation 1 comics and elsewhere.

====Retellings====
The first time the Primus/Unicron backstory appears is in the UK comic continuity, in the story "The Legacy of Unicron!", when Unicron recounts it to [[Death's Head]]. Per Unicron's telling of events, he was a primal force of evil at the dawn of the universe, who led a legion of Dark Gods against his mortal foe, Primus, Lord of the Light Gods. Events proceed to play out basically as described above, though the role of the Light and Dark Gods diminishes with each subsequent retelling of the story, until the current version, in which Primus and Unicron are alone, and have a unique origin.

The story is told a second time in the United States book{{clarify|date=March 2016}} by the Keeper, an ancient mechanoid who guarded Primus's head at the center of Cybertron. This telling is effectively the same as the UK story, but mentions that the battle of Primus and Unicron was towards the end of the era of gods, that Primus and Unicron were the last of their respective pantheons, and Primus has to defeat Unicron before he can take his place with the other gods in the "[[Matrix of Leadership|Omniversal Matrix]]".

The story is told a third time in the United States Marvel series by Primus, when he gathers all his children together to prepare for Unicron's coming. In this telling, Unicron predates the [[universe|current universe]], and destroyed the previous universe. He slept peacefully, alone in the [[void (astronomy)|void]] of un-creation that remained, until fragments of the old universe that he had overlooked reacted, causing the Big Bang and birthing the current universe. The "sentient core" of this new universe recognizes the threat that Unicron poses, and so creates Primus to counter his evil and be guardian of the new creation.

The first modern retelling of the origins of Primus and Unicron comes from a set of ''[[Transformers: Armada]]'' trading cards released by [[Fleer]]. The backstory printed on Unicron's card introduces the concept of two brothers created to explore the new universe by an extra-dimensional entity named the "[[Allspark]]".''

This is subsequently expanded on and combined with aspects of the various Marvel Comics stories in ''[[Transformers: The Ultimate Guide]]'', published by Dorling Kindersley and written by [[Simon Furman]], who had written all three prior tellings. Here, the entity Fleer had called the "Allspark" is redubbed "The One", and the modern iteration of the myth detailed above is firmly established, and forms the backbone of subsequent fiction such as ''[[Transformers: Universe]]'' and [[Fun Publications]]' ''[[Transformers: Cybertron]]'' comics.

===Across the Multiverse===
Although many of the official television and comic appearances of Unicron appear to present separate and distinct incarnations of the character, some writers have presented an interpretation of the sources that tie all the versions of Unicron together into a single continuity. Likewise, Primus is a "multiversal singularity", but while Unicron is limited in this ability, and can only exist in one reality at a time, travelling between them, Primus co-exists in all realities simultaneously.

This concept began with the release of a series of ''Transformers: Armada'' trading cards by [[Fleer]]. The biography printed on Unicron's card presents him as one of two heralds created by the [[Allspark]] to explore the newly birthed universe. Inspired by his Marvel Comics origin, the other herald is [[Primus (Transformers)|Primus]], and the brothers set about this task, until they come upon a region of space teeming with pure Energon. Unicron wants the power for himself, and cuts Primus down before he can report it to the Allspark, casting his brother's body into the orbit of a nearby star. Unicron goes on to become the engine of destruction that menaces the universe.

The publication of ''Transformers: The Ultimate Guide'' by [[Dorling Kindersley]] cemented this notion. Writer Simon Furman incorporated the various aspects of the Dreamwave comics story, some elements of the Fleer storyline, and his original Marvel Comics origin to create what is now essentially the "definitive" origin for Unicron.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} In this version of events, Unicron and Primus are again twin heralds, giant metal planetoids created by the "One", who are sent to explore the universe. Unicron is an imperfect being and turns to evil, adapting his form to transform into a giant robot. To battle him, The One gives Primus this power as well, but Primus opts to remain in planet mode. He passes the transforming abilities on to thirteen robots he creates, the first Transformers. One of the thirteen turns on Primus and sides with Unicron, and the war culminates in a battle that sees Unicron and this traitor, the "[[Fallen (Transformers)|Fallen]]", sucked through a black hole into another universe.

This new origin is part of the G1 timeline laid down by the Ultimate Guide, which is apparently being taken as the "official" G1 timeline for future projects that require it.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} This means there is only one Unicron who travels from universe to universe across all the assorted ''Transformers'' continuities. This interpretation of the character is evidenced by the parallel universe spanning ''[[Transformers: Universe]]'' toyline and convention-exclusive comic books — in which the singular Unicron captured Transformers from various alternate realities and pitted them against each other, feeding off the energies released — and the ''Transformers: Cybertron'' comic strip in the Transformers Collectors' Club fan magazine, which depicts Unicron's actions in the various realities in a chronological order and claims that Cybertron is the stable heart of the Multiverse.

==Physical dimensions==
Unicron's size is never specified in any canon materials, aside from the vague term "planet size". In ''The Transformers: The Movie'', Unicron's height appears to be anywhere from several kilometers (as when handling [[Galvatron]]) to several hundred kilometers (as when attacking and destroying Lithone and Cybertron's moons, and attacking [[Cybertron]]). A planet-mode diameter of {{convert|1000|km|abbr=on}} has been suggested&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merzo.net/2000mpp.htm 2000 meters per pixel at Jeff Russell's Starship Dimensions]&lt;/ref&gt; and robot-mode dimensions can follow from that estimate, provided that there is no change in size (compression or expansion) common among so many Transformers. One scene in the movie shows [[Jazz (Transformers)|Jazz]] driving out of one of Unicron's eyes, just small enough to fit through them, though in another scene the [[Quintesson]] ship [[Rodimus|Hot Rod]] arrived in is tiny compared with the eye. Unicron is also small enough to stand on Cybertron's surface.&lt;ref&gt;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XdCd6K2ACdc/TngtSicr9iI/AAAAAAAAKgY/b3bPP8sqrYQ/s1600/Unicron.JPG&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://pics.livejournal.com/shortpacked/pic/0003wr79&lt;/ref&gt; In season 3, it is shown that the eyes from [[Metroplex (Transformers)|Metroplex]] and [[Trypticon]] (both city-sized Transformers) are the perfect size to use as replacement parts when Unicron orders the ghost of [[Starscream]] to steal them. However, later in the episode when Trypticon moves Unicron's head, the head is larger than Trypticon's entire body. (Note: However, the eyes could be only small components for his Optic Sensors to be reformed and/ or completed.) In the storyline "The Ultimate Doom", Cybertron appears to be smaller than Earth's own moon (and by extension, this would indicate Lithone would be too small to be a planet), making Unicron's dimensions in the cartoon harder to define.

The comic version of Unicron may be far larger. In the first issue of [[Marvel Comics]] [[Generation One]] ''Transformers'' comic, Cybertron is said to be around the size of [[Saturn]] (which has a diameter of roughly {{convert|120,000|km|abbr=on}} at the [[equator]]). As Unicron's planet mode is seen to be about a quarter the size of Cybertron in the comics,&lt;ref&gt;A shot of Unicron standing on top of Cybertron shows his robot mode to be not quite a planetary diameter tall.&lt;/ref&gt; this suggests a diameter of 30,000+ km. The Dreamwave equivalent of Unicron may be the same size, as the Cybertron of the Dreamwave universe is said to be the size of Saturn.

In the ''Transformers: Cybertron'' comics, the tank version of Unicron is only the same size as an average Transformer, and is shorter than the Autobots [[Sentinel Maximus]] and [[Omega Prime]], whom he fought.

The ''Transformers Prime'' iteration of Unicron depicts his physical manifestation as the Earth itself, with his consciousness held within the core, making him a planet with sustainable life, though it has not been seen if Unicron wishes to consume other planets like his other incarnations.

==Animated series==

===The Transformers===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2011}}
The character Unicron first appears in the opening scene of 1986's ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]'', immediately making clear his goal by consuming the small world of [[Lithone]]. Subsequently, when the Decepticons [[Megatron]], [[Skywarp]], [[Thundercracker]], and the [[Insecticons]] are set adrift in space and left to die following a furious battle with the [[Autobot]]s, Unicron appears before them and offers Megatron a deal: in exchange for a new body, and new troops, Megatron will destroy the [[Matrix of Leadership|Autobot Matrix of Leadership]], the only thing that can stand in Unicron's way. Thus, Unicron rebuilds Megatron into a new and more powerful body, and rechristens him to [[Galvatron]]. He then uses the battered bodies of the other Decepticons and creates [[Scourge (Transformers)|Scourge]], the tracker, from Thundercracker and his huntsmen, the [[Scourge (Transformers)|Sweeps]], from [[Kickback (Transformers)|Kickback]] and [[Shrapnel (Transformers)|Shrapnel]]. [[Cyclonus]], the warrior is then created, from [[Bombshell (Transformers)|Bombshell]] and Skywarp (two Cyclonus' are shown, which is an animation error, as later throughout the movie and the TV series Cyclonus is only one character). After that, Unicron also gives Galvatron a vessel, and Galvatron begins to carry out his assigned task, although he is loath to do so. When Galvatron shows any signs of opposition to Unicron's will, Unicron inflicts agonizing torture in his mind to coerce him into obedience.

Following Unicron's consumption of [[Cybertron]]'s two moons, Galvatron obtains the Matrix from [[Ultra Magnus]], believing he can use it to bring Unicron under his control. Attempting to open the Matrix to intimidate Unicron, Galvatron only prompts his transformation into robot mode, and is swallowed by the planet-eater. Unicron lays waste to Cybertron, halted briefly when the young Autobot rookie, [[Hot Rod (Transformers)|Hot Rod]], crashes a [[Quintessons|Quintesson]] spacecraft through his eye. Finding Hot Rod inside Unicron's body, Galvatron suggests an alliance against their common enemy. However, Unicron inflicts his mental torture upon Galvatron, forcing him to fight Hot Rod. Hot Rod takes the Matrix from Galvatron during the battle, and becomes [[Rodimus Prime]]. Rodimus throws Galvatron into space, freeing him from Unicron's mind-control. Rodimus opens the Matrix within Unicron, destroying his body, leaving only his head, which becomes a moon of Cybertron.&lt;ref&gt;*{{Cite book | title=Transformers: The Ultimate Guide | last=Furman | first=Simon | date=2004 | publisher=DK Publishing Inc.| ISBN=1-4053-0461-8 | pages= 40–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Unicron's head drifts around in space the movie ends, with the credits shown in a background of his head floating in space.

In ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]'', Unicron was voiced by [[Orson Welles]]. Unicron proved to be Welles's final role, as he died a few days after completing work on the project; rumors persist that Welles did not complete recording of all his lines, and that [[Leonard Nimoy]] filled in for him, but the film's voice director [[Wally Burr]] and actress [[Susan Blu]] refute the claim. There were two early attempts to produce Unicron toys for the ''Transformers'' toyline, featuring voice clips from Welles himself, but the results never made it to production. It was not until 2003 that a production Unicron toy was made. For the 20th anniversary of the original movie, Diamond Select released an eight and a half inch tall statue of Unicron and Rodimus Prime.

The third season of ''The Transformers'' animated series continues Unicron's story where the movie left off, as the planet-eater's deactivated head settles into orbit around [[Cybertron]]. His head is visited by [[Cyclonus]], who accesses the memory bank to discern the fate of Galvatron. Later, the ghost of the deceased Decepticon [[Starscream]] reactivates Unicron's head and enters into a bargain with him, performing three labors in exchange for the restoration of his body. Starscream (inhabiting and controlling [[Scourge (Transformers)|Scourge]]'s body) gathers for Unicron [[Metroplex (Transformers)|Metroplex]]'s eyes (breaking one and replacing it with one from [[Trypticon]]) and Trypticon's transformation cog. He begins to connect his head to Cybertron, which would become Unicron's new body. Starscream demands that Unicron restore his own body so that he can complete the required connections. Once Unicron does so, Starscream double-crosses him, and refuses to finish the job. Unicron's head is subsequently blown off into space by an explosion instigated by the Autobots.

Later, when searching for a new supply of positrons (anti-electrons), the Decepticons venture to Unicron's head, where Cyclonus and Scourge accidentally awake the slumbering demi-god. At the same time, [[Grimlock]] constructs from pieces of Unicron's head the [[Technobots]], and one of their number, [[Strafe (Transformers)|Strafe]], severs enough of Unicron's neural connections to shut him back down.

Although Unicron himself does not appear again, his origin in the animated series is later revealed. Unicron was created near the beginning of the universe by the diminutive genius known as Primacron, who intended for him to devour all life in the universe, leaving a blank slate that Primacron could use as he saw fit. However, Unicron turned upon Primacron, deciding that ''he'' would rule the universe and subsequently setting out to achieve that goal.

Unicron's head is seen one last time as Primacron's new creation cripples [[Cybertron]]. This time the head looks very old and almost stone-like, underlining that Unicron is finally dead.

When the ''Generation 2'' animated series aired, animated bits of the film with Unicron in it were edited into the episode "More Than Meets The Eye Part 1".

===Beast Era===
Although the real Unicron did not make any appearances in 1996's CGI animated series, ''[[Beast Wars]]'', he is mentioned. Starscream's ghost spins a lie that Unicron had destroyed him (Unicron's planet mode is seen in Starscream's fabricated flashback), and when the mysterious alien race known as the [[List of Beast Wars and Beast Machines characters#Non-aligned characters|Vok]] directly communicates with [[Maximal (Transformers)|Maximal]] leader [[Optimus Primal]], they search his mind for an image that he would fear and respect, find Unicron, and take the form of his head. Later, in Season 3 of ''Beast Wars'', [[Tarantulas (Transformers)|Tarantulas]] attempts to destroy both Autobots and Decepticons in the ''[[Ark (Transformers)|Ark]]'', as he and the [[List of Predacons#Tripredacus|Tripredacus Council]] are descended from a different lineage than Autobot or Decepticon, and would hence inherit Cybertron all to themselves. Although never directly stated, it is implied that the ancestor of Tarantulas and the Council is Unicron; Megatron refers to Tarantulas as "Unicron's spawn" in the ''Beast Wars'' episode "Nemesis Part 1".

In Episode 16 of ''[[Beast Machines]]'', [[Rattrap]] calls Megatron's floating head a tribute to Unicron.

Conversely, Unicron played a large role in the two Japanese-exclusive animated ''Beast Wars'' series, ''[[Beast Wars II]]'' and ''[[Beast Wars Neo]]''. Following the events of ''The Transformers: The Movie'' and Unicron's demise, the [[Spark (Transformers)#Beast Era|Angolmois energy]] that gave Unicron life are left sealed within planet Gaia (a future version of Earth). When the war on this planet between the forces of Maximal leader [[Leo Prime|Lio Convoy]] and [[Predacon (Transformers)|Predacon]] leader [[Galvatron (Beast Wars II)|Galvatron]] (a different individual bearing the same name as Unicron's original creation) culminates in the explosion of Galvatron's [[Nemesis (Transformers)|Nemesis]] battle fortress, the resultant energy surge revives Unicron's consciousness. Seeking to complete his resurrection, he creates the [[Blendtrons]] to gather the Angolmois Capsules his life-energy is sealed in, and then proceeds to possess the lifeless body of Galvatron as a temporary host. After gathering the capsules, Unicron attempts to make Cybertron his new body, but is defeated by Maximal commander [[Big Convoy]].

As with his original incarnation, there was a failed attempt to make Unicron into a toy for the ''Beast Wars Neo'' line, and although regarded as quite impressive, the prototype - which, notably, does not resemble Unicron from the associated series at all - did not make it to production.

===Unicron Trilogy===
Although Unicron plays a major role in the above-mentioned Japanese series, he had not been featured as a major player in American fiction for over a decade. The advent of the three co-produced series ''[[Transformers: Armada]]'', ''[[Transformers: Energon]]'' and ''[[Transformers: Cybertron]]'' reintroduced Unicron to American audiences and finally rendered him in toy form, with the [[Mini-Con]] partner [[Dead End (Transformers)|Dead End]]. In reference to Unicron's key role in these three series, Hasbro's head of Transformers, [[Aaron Archer]], has collectively dubbed them "The Unicron Trilogy".

This incarnation of Unicron is not shown to physically consume planets in the same manner as his G1 predecessor, only to blast and absorb the remains. During his battle with [[Optimus Supreme]], who has grown to Unicron's size, Unicron demonstrates that he has enough power to simply destroy a planet completely without consuming it, but several references are made to consumption, so he may indeed perform the action. In one of the mini-comic books packed in with the later Armada toys, Unicron is illustrated literally eating an asteroid or moon whole.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} This Unicron was voiced by [[Mark Acheson]] in the U.S., and by [[Katsumi Chō]] in Japan.

A primal force of evil from the beginning of time, his origins lost to history, the ''Armada'' universe's incarnation of Unicron is the embodiment of the darkness and hate in the hearts of all beings. Defeated by the Autobot warrior [[Omega Supreme]] at some time in the ancient past of Cybertron, Unicron hides himself in plain sight of the Transformers, disguised as the planet's moon. In order to re-energise himself, Unicron implants some of his own cells within Cybertron, where they grow and "hatch", giving birth to the diminutive race of robots called the [[Mini-Cons]]. Unicron intends them to increase the ferocity of the Autobot/Decepticon war, allowing Unicron to feed off the hatred. As a result of interference by human children, displaced in time from the 21st century, the Mini-Cons develop sentience and flee Cybertron, crashing on Earth where they lay dormant for a million years.

The subsequent awakening of the Mini-Cons increases the pace of the war, and to hasten the proceeding, Unicron creates another being from his own body, Sideways. Sideways serves as Unicron's agent to manipulate the events on Earth to keep the balance of power shifting and the ferocity of both sides increasing. At the culmination of his plan, the Decepticons come into possession of all three Mini-Con weapons - the Star Saber, the Skyboom Shield and the Requiem Blaster - which Sideways and Thrust steal and use to reactivate Unicron.

Unicron transforms to robot mode and turns on Cybertron as the combined Autobot/Decepticon armada attempt in vain to stop him. [[Optimus Prime (Unicron Trilogy)|Optimus Prime]] and [[Megatron (Unicron Trilogy)|Megatron]] (now Galvatron) enter his body with the human children, and Unicron addresses them through [[Sideways (Transformers)|Sideways]]'s form. He absorbs all but Optimus into his collective consciousness and brings the Mini-Cons back under his control. However, from within Unicron's mind, Rad is able to use his connection to High Wire to restore the Mini-Cons' individual minds, freeing the weapons and deactivating Unicron. With the danger apparently over, Galvatron challenges Prime to a final battle, but the hatred between the foes stirs Unicron to life again, and upon realizing this, Galvatron decides to sacrifice himself to ensure there will be no more hatred. Plunging into Unicron's maw and allowing Optimus to escape alive, Galvatron ends the hatred. In a mighty flash, Unicron vanishes without a trace, although at the end of the series he is shown orbiting an unknown planet.

Unicron's body is inactive and badly damaged from his previous battle. Ten years after Galvatron's sacrifice a former victim of Unicron chooses to strike. Within Unicron's shell, the Spark of [[Quintessons|Alpha Q]], ruler of Planet Q, which Unicron had consumed in the past, still exists. From Unicron's body he creates the [[Terrorcon]]s to gather Energon, which he intends to use to regenerate all the worlds Unicron devoured. However, Megatron's corpse and Spark remain within Unicron, and slowly siphon off some of the gathered Energon, allowing him to be reborn in a new body through the unintentional actions of [[Scorponok]]. Hunted by Megatron, Alpha-Q then jettisons Unicron's head and escapes in it. Megatron takes over Unicron's body and continues to gather Energon in order to rebuild Unicron to use as a weapon. A joint attack by Alpha-Q, the Autobots, and their human allies sees all of Earth's Energon channeled into Unicron's head, which Alpha-Q then rams into Unicron's body. The positively charged Energon of Earth reacts with the negatively charged Energon running through Unicron. It tears open a fissure in reality leading to a new area of space where planets Unicron consumed are recreated and sustained through the Energon radiated from Unicron's head, which is now a glowing red sun.

Unicron's body, damaged once more, lies in the dark reaches near the fissure. The Decepticons raid Alpha-Q's new planets for the Energon necessary to revive Unicron again. Megatron directs Unicron's body to retrieve his head, extinguishing the Energon Sun and killing Alpha-Q in the process. Unicron begins to take over Megatron's body. Unicron's body is destroyed in battle by Optimus Supreme with the help of some of the other Autobots. Unbeknownst to anyone, Unicron lives on in two forms: his minuscule Spark, and his consciousness, which lies buried in Megatron's mind. With subconscious nudgings, Unicron leads Megatron to a large reservoir of "Super Energon" beneath Cybertron's surface, which transforms him into Galvatron. After a series of failed battles, Galvatron exposes himself to the Super Energon once again, and grows to a gigantic height. Unicron seizes control of his body as a new vessel and sets out to rejoin with his Spark, but a [[Primus (Transformers)|Primus]]-empowered Optimus Supreme engages him in battle again, and draws all of Unicron's consciousness out of Galvatron and seals it within his own Spark. Enraged, Galvatron prepares to destroy Unicron's Spark, but it merges with him, enlarging him again. He battles again with Optimus Supreme, this time bolstered by the combined energy of all his troops' Sparks. Meanwhile, Primus merges with the Super Energon, creating a fledgling sun which arrives at the site of the battle. Taking control of his body for a brief moment, Galvatron sacrifices himself to stop Unicron, plunging into the infant sun, which ignites and gives new life to Alpha-Q's worlds.

With Unicron's destruction in ''Energon'', the collapse of his body results in the creation of an enormous [[black hole]] which, if left unchecked, will consume and destroy everything. The Autobots must find the [[Omega Lock]] and the [[Cyber Planet Key]]s to save Cybertron and the universe. Later, the ''Cybertron'' Transformers learn from [[Primus (Transformers)|Primus]] that destroying Unicron results in an imbalance between good (Primus, who still exists) and evil (Unicron, who is gone); this imbalance factored into the creation of the black hole, known as the Unicron Singularity in American fiction or the Grand Black Hole in Japan. His scattered pieces are absorbed by Megatron giving Megatron dark powers and causing him to look like Unicron.

The Japanese equivalent, ''Galaxy Force'', makes several scattered references to Unicron, as the Japanese producers for the series decided not to have ''Galaxy Force'' follow  the events of ''Micron Legend'' (the Japanese equivalent of ''Armada'') and ''Super Link'' (the Japanese equivalent of ''Energon'').

The Unicron toy in the ''[[Cybertron]]'' series is the size of a deluxe class Transformer toy and transforms into a Cybertronian tank instead of a planet. This portrayal of Unicron is consistent with his appearance in the ''Cybertron'' strip in the Hasbro Club Collector's comic where he is portrayed at around the same size as his foes [[Sentinel Maximus]] and [[Omega Prime]].

===''Aligned'' continuity===
In the ''[[Transformers: Prime]]'' storyline, Unicron (voiced by [[John Noble]]) is the source of Dark Energon, a form of Energon with the ability to revive the dead - albeit in a mindless, zombie-like "Terrorcon" state - also known by the name "the blood of Unicron". Unicron is believed to represent the Anti-Spark (most likely a counterpart of the [[Allspark]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Tformers.com |url=http://tformers.com/transformers-first-look-at-transformers-prime-screeners-review-*-spoilers-ahead*/14710/news.html |title=First Look at Transformers Prime Screeners Review - * SPOILERS!

As the Chaos Bringer drifted through space, he attracted space debris around himself that coalesced into Planet Earth, rich with Dark Energon. The gravitational pull of an astrological alignment awakens Unicron from his slumber, as Earth's weather patterns go out of control. Having transcended physical form, Unicron berates Megatron for thinking of being his servant.

Sensing Optimus Prime and the Matrix of Leadership, Unicron resolves to finish the Autobot leader himself. He creates [[golem]] incarnations of himself to kill the Autobot. Though Optimus Prime pleas for the humans who evolved on Earth, Unicron dismisses them as parasites with the intent to slaughter them, once he finishes with Optimus Prime. Though the Autobots come to Optimus Prime's aid, Megatron destroys the last golem, refusing to allow anyone else to kill Optimus Prime. He sides with the Autobots and guides them to the Earth's core to stop Unicron before he completely awakens. Despite using his anti-bodies and possessing Megatron's body to hinder him and the other Autobots, Optimus Prime uses the Matrix of Leadership to deactivate Unicron without destroying the Earth, though he loses his memory of being a Prime until the Autobots restore it.&lt;ref&gt;[[List of Transformers: Prime episodes#Season 2 (2012)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The awakening of Unicron from within the Earth draws the attention of [[Lio Convoy]] in another dimension. Travelling across realities, he arrives to find that the Autobots and Decepticons have already defeated Unicron, but elects to remain for a time to safeguard against his potential return. Using his ancient sword and the power of his ''Energon Matrix'', Lio Convoy carves up the remains of one of Unicron's rock-and-stone avatars to create the ''Gaia Armor'', severing its link to Unicron but allowing it to retain the power of Dark Energon.

Unicron returns in the series finale movie ''[[Transformers Prime Beast Hunters: Predacons Rising]]''. When Optimus Prime restores the spirit of Primus, Unicron senses it and reawakens, this time in energy form. He confronts Megatron, saying that because of the Dark Energon within him, Megatron cannot become one with the Allspark. Therefore, he will become Unicron's vessel, and serve him in order to destroy Cybertron. Unicron brings Megatron back to life and upgrades his form, using it to travel through hyperspace toward Cybertron. Upon arriving, he confronts Bumblebee, Arcee, Bulkhead, and Smokescreen, nearly killing them using his Dark Energon weapons. Megatron starts to question Unicron's motives of destroying Cybertron, but Unicron psychically tortures him to keep him at bay. After their escape, Unicron comes across [[Predaking]], who, upon recognizing Megatron's body, viciously attacks Unicron in beast mode. Unicron proves to be stronger than Predaking and knocks him unconscious. He reads his mind, finding that Predacon remains will make a perfect legion for his destruction of Cybertron and Primus.

Unicron proceeds to a Predacon boneyard, defeating Predacons Skylynx and Darksteel in battle and bringing hundreds of deceased Predacons back to life as Terrorcons. He leads his new army to Cybertron's Well of All Sparks, and engages the Autobots, Decepticons, and Predacons in battle. He confronts Optimus Prime when he senses the Allspark. He fights him on even terms until he strikes Optimus down when Optimus makes a grab for the Allspark's container as Bumblebee holds Unicron down. Escaping Bumblebee, Unicron flies after Optimus and opens the container. He realizes too late that it is a trick, and his energy form is sucked into the container, freeing Megatron from his control and defeating Unicron. His legions of undead Predacons are destroyed. It turns out that Optimus had stored the Allspark in the Matrix of Leadership and would soon take the Matrix into the Well, sacrificing himself to ensure the return of Cybertronian life. Now understanding oppression, Megatron relinquishes his hatred and his lust for conquest, leaving for parts unknown to start anew.

Unicron reappears in the sequel series, ''[[Transformers: Robots in Disguise (2015 TV series)|Transformers: Robots in Disguise]]'', set five years after the events of ''Predacons Rising''. Although the majority of Unicron's anti-spark were safely imprisoned in the Allspark container, a remnant of the anti-spark still exists with Unicron's original body at the Earth's core. When [[Fallen (Transformers)|Megatronus]] is freed and brought to Earth, he uses a spark-merging staff to extract the remnant from beneath the Earth, intending to merge the anti-spark and the Allspark together to destroy both Earth and Cybertron. When the staff is broken before it can fully draw in the Allspark, the anti-spark remnant returns to the Earth's core.

In the ''[[Transformers: Rescue Bots]]'' (set in the same continuity as ''Prime'') episode "Christmas in July", Heatwave tells [[Boulder]] that his throwing skills are insufficient to hit the backside of Unicron. Optimus Prime later references Unicron when the Burns discover a prehistoric island underneath Griffin Rock, telling them "there are many things beneath the Earth's surface humans are not aware of".

==Publication history==

===Marvel Comics===
In the comics, Unicron is a fallen god from before the universe existed who seeks the ultimate peace granted by the destruction of all life. Unicron accomplishes this, wiping out everything in the universe and leaving only nothingness and void. His lust for destruction sated, Unicron enters a deep sleep, but he had not been thorough enough. Tiny fragments of the old universe react with each other, and a new universe is born. As Unicron sleeps, the core of this new universe - somehow a sentient being - becomes aware of Unicron's threat and creates a defender to battle his evil - [[Primus (Transformers)|Primus]], the lord of light. Unicron awakes to find himself surrounded by another universe, and begins to destroy it again.

He and Primus clash many times, the force of their battles wiping out the very life Primus had been created to protect. To stop the destruction, Primus shifts the battle to the astral plane. In shifting the battle back to the physical universe without time to properly generate their energy forms, Primus entraps both himself and Unicron in two barren asteroids. Over the eons, Unicron learns to psionically shape his asteroid, and transforms it into a metallic planet, and then into a gargantuan robot. Primus, fearing that following suit by forming himself in a similar manner will simply pick up the conflict where it had left off, seeks an alternative way to defend the universe against the threat of Unicron by turning his asteroid into [[Cybertron]]. He populates it with robotic beings that, like Unicron, can alter their forms, giving rise to the transformers.

Unicron's slightly convoluted comic tenure began in the [[United Kingdom]]'s exclusive ''Transformers'' comic series, which splices its own stories with reprinted American material. Writer [[Simon Furman]] worked elements of the movie into his stories, creating a future universe based on the movie's events, but different from the cartoon. In the first use of this timeline, in the mega-serial, ''[[Target: 2006]]'', Galvatron travels back in time in an attempt to escape the control of Unicron. Unicron is able to ensnare the minds of three Autobots - Hot Rod, [[List of Autobots#Cars|Kup]] and [[Blurr]] - and sends them back in time after him to foil his plot. Though Unicron's role in the story itself was minor, it offered the first glimpse of his greater mental power.

In the UK comics' version of post-movie events, Unicron's head does not enter Cybertron's orbit, and instead crashlands on the [[Junk (Transformers)|Planet of Junk]]. Still active, Unicron uses his mental powers to enslave the minds of the Junkion natives, who set about rebuilding his body. [[Cyclonus]], [[Scourge (Transformers)|Scourge]], and the freelance peacekeeping agent, [[Death's Head]], fall prey to him. He uses them to exacerbate the stalemated war on Cybertron to keep the Autobots busy, so that they will not learn of his impending resurrection. When Death's Head fights back against Unicron's mental control, Unicron rewards his temerity by revealing the comic book version of his origin. Death's Head then aids Rodimus Prime, projecting his mind into Unicron's where they battle, until Unicron's head is destroyed by explosives, and his essence sealed within the Matrix. Rodimus and several other future Autobots subsequently travel back in time to 1989 and participate in the "Time Wars". When they attempt to return to their own time afterward, they discover that disruptions to the timestream have erased their future, and replaced it with one where the Decepticons rule Cybertron. In this future, Unicron's essence emerges from the Matrix and briefly takes over Rodimus Prime, before he is thwarted by the removal of the Matrix from Rodimus's body. In 2010, however, Unicron attempted this again and succeeded, controlling Rodimus's body and reshaping it into his own image, before being defeated by Rodimus's own force of will.

In 1987, Simon Furman began writing the U.S. ''Transformers'' series in addition to the UK comics, and set in motion an epic Unicron-themed story. Unicron makes his presence known to the Transformers much earlier than 2005.

A battle between the Autobot Classic [[Pretenders (Transformers)|Pretenders]] and the Decepticons' [[Mayhem Attack Squad]] at the centre of Cybertron has the side effect of waking the slumbering Primus, who is struck by a stray laser blast and awakes with a scream. Although he immediately sinks back into slumber, his scream echoes throughout the universe and Unicron hears it. Now aware of his enemy's location, Unicron heads towards Cybertron, but, seeking a herald to sow chaos in his name ahead of his coming, uses his formidable powers to send three agents - [[Hook, Line and Sinker (Transformers)|Hook, Line and Sinker]], forward in time to an alternate future version of 2009. In this timeline, Unicron succeeds in consuming Cybertron in the year 2005, and Galvatron and the Decepticons rule Earth. This timeline's version of Galvatron is pulled back to 1990 by Hook, Line and Sinker and press-ganged into Unicron's service, but, like his predecessors, turns on his master by forcing Emirate Xaaron to awaken Primus in hopes of destroying Unicron. Primus possesses Xaaron and attempts to hold off Unicron, but he is weak, and his attack a ruse{{clarify|date=March 2016}}, leading to his own destruction. This, along with a direct attack by Galvatron, succeeds in galvanising the Autobots and Decepticons to attack Unicron together. They do little damage and many Transformers die before Optimus Prime is able use the Matrix to destroy Unicron, exploding his body from within.

===Dreamwave Productions===
[[File:Unicron DKUG.jpg|left|250px|thumbnail|Unicron, as seen in the [[Dorling Kindersley]] Ultimate Guide]]
In contrast to his major roles in the Marvel comics, the cancellation of the [[Dreamwave Productions|Dreamwave]] Transformers comics meant that Unicron would play a much lesser role in events. His presence is first hinted at in the second "War Within" arc, where the [[Fallen (Transformers)|Fallen]] enlist the [[Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos]] [[Trinity]] ([[Bludgeon (Transformers)|Bludgeon]], [[Bugly]], and [[Mindwipe (Transformers)|Mindwipe]]) to capture a number of Transformers ([[Grimlock]], [[Blitzwing]], [[Jetfire]], and [[Hot Spot (Transformers)|Hot Spot]]) for an arcane ritual to summon the Fallen's Master. It fails, due to a combined strike by [[Prowl (Transformers)|Prowl]]'s Autobots and [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave's]] [[Decepticons]], with the Fallen being killed by [[Primus (Transformers)|Primus]].

He makes his first mainstream appearance in volume 3, issue 1 of the main Generation One series, seemingly summoned by Shockwave at the end of the previous volume. He dispatches Scourge at the head of a huge armada of [[Sweeps (Transformers)|Sweeps]] to search the galaxy for Cybertron. [[Scourge]] locates it, but is shot in the back and deactivated by Shockwave, who used analysis of his body to create the [[Triple Changer]]s. Unicron destroys Lithone, before beginning to journey to Earth. Dreamwave went bankrupt and the next issue was never released. Writer Chris Sarracini has indicated that he would have followed through on the Unicron storyline, and also would have had the Dreamwave version of Cyclonus rescue Scourge from US government study.

Although [[Dreamwave Productions]]' Unicron Trilogy comics were cut short halfway through their ''Transformers: Energon'' series, they establish an important piece of information that is used to shape Unicron's story in future fiction. This version of Unicron does not merely consume worlds and seek the destruction of the singular universe, but moves from universe to universe, destroying entire realities until all of causality and existence is obliterated.

His coming in the ''Armada'' comic universe is foreshadowed when he pulls [[Optimus Prime (Unicron Trilogy)|Optimus Prime]] into a parallel dimension where Cybertron is devastated. Unicron sends the nearly dead [[Optimus Prime]] of the parallel universe to the main universe, who warns them of Unicron's coming before dying. Subsequently, Unicron sends his [[Heralds of Unicron|Heralds]] - alternates of the Generation 1 versions of [[Galvatron]], [[Scourge (Transformers)|Scourge]], [[Thunderwing]], [[Dirge (Transformers)|Dirge]], and [[Bludgeon (Transformers)|Bludgeon]] - ahead to destroy those who can oppose him (including [[Megatron (Unicron Trilogy)|Megatron]]) and capture the Mini-Con Matrix.

Galvatron is killed by Megatron using the [[Star Saber]], and the other Heralds are destroyed in their captured Decepticon base by an explosion engineered by [[Jetfire]]. Unaware of his Heralds' failure, Unicron now threatens to destroy Prime, but the Mini-Cons and Jetfire manage to rescue Prime, with the power of the Mini-Con Matrix upgrading them and combining them into their [[Powerlink (Transformers)|Powerlink]]ed mode. They hold off Unicron long enough to escape back to their universe. Unicron comes to the ''Armada'' universe himself, where he is attacked by a combined force of Autobots and Decepticons. They distract him long enough for the Mini-Cons to access the power of the [[Mini-Con]] Matrix and destroy the Chaos-Bringer.

Unicron survives, but is crippled and no longer has the power to transform or even move. He is forced to employ servants to do his bidding: Alpha Q and the [[Terrorcon]]s, who are disgruntled former Decepticons upgraded by Unicron in return for harvesting enough Energon to repower him. While they attack Earth, a rich source of Energon, Unicron sends his four Horsemen - [[Rhinox]], [[Airazor]], [[Terrorsaur]] and [[Cheetor]], absorbed by Unicron in the previous battle - against Cybertron, devastating much of it before Optimus Prime stops them. Many of the latter Energon stories are set inside Unicron himself as Megatron, whose [[Spark (Transformers)|Spark]] also survived the previous battle, attempts to convince Prime to resurrect him in a new body, with the planet eater seemingly unaware of their actions.

Alpha Q shows signs of rebelling against Unicron, and Prime prepares to fight back from inside Unicron. The series was canceled before these plot threads could come to fruition. Writer [[Simon Furman]] revealed that a future storyline of the ''Energon'' comic would have included another attack by Unicron.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

===Devil's Due Publishing===
Unicron made a cameo appearance in the second ''G.I. Joe vs the Transformers'' crossover produced by Devil's Due. At the end of the arc, [[Cobra Command|Cobra]] operative [[Doctor Mindbender]] meets with the cult [[Cobra-La]] and discovers their alliance with Unicron. One of [[Optimus Prime]]'s visions of the future shows Mindbender and Unicron as a coming threat, a prophecy that comes to pass in the fourth crossover "Black Horizon".

Apparently banished from his world thousands of years ago, Unicron travels the galaxy, devouring planets to quench his hunger and taking their populations as slaves to maintain his inner body works. He runs into trouble when attacking Earth. [[Cobra-La|A strange set of non-human creatures]] oppose Unicron, threatening to attack him with a metal-devouring organic spore. Before the two sides can annihilate each other, they reach an agreement favouring both parties. The creatures will go into hiding, allowing humanity to develop. When they reach a sufficient technological level to serve as slaves for Unicron's inner workings, they will call Unicron. He will destroy humanity and they will inherit the human-free world he leaves behind. Thousands of years later the pact is kept and the creatures, now calling themselves Cobra-La, summon Unicron via a beacon. After attacking a pirate vessel on the outskirts of a solar system, Unicron journeys to Earth. Hailed as the "Doom Star" by terrified humans, Unicron transforms to robot mode and prepares to destroy humanity. He is thwarted when [[Cosmos (Transformers)|Cosmos]] and [[Flint (G.I. Joe)|Flint]] travel through his mouth into his body bearing the metal-eating spores of Cobra-La. Despite the best efforts of his "anti-bodies" (the [[Beastformers]]), they deliver the spores directly to his brain. He is last seen entering convulsions, indicating he is no longer a threat. It is later mentioned his body is floating around Earth.

In this continuity, Unicron is thought of as the Transformers' equivalent of the "boogeyman". The revelation that Unicron had been banished from his home planet indicates a different origin from ones used for previous incarnations of Unicron.

===Botcon===
The storyline for the [[Botcon]] fan convention from 1998 to 2000 featured Unicron's life force ending up on prehistoric Earth following the destruction of his body in ''Transformers: The Movie''. It is eventually found by a lowly Predacon known as the Hunter, who fashions a container for it that he dubs the Decepticon Matrix of Conquest. Taking the name [[Shokaract]], this villain seems to become one with Unicron himself, with the pair of them laying waste to Shokaract's Cybertron and the rest of the universe. However, the instability of the timestream means that Unicron's lifeforce, also known as the Dark Essence, is in danger of being pulled away from prehistoric Earth before the Hunter can find it, which would undo Shokaract's timeline. Shokaract thus dispatches two of his Heralds, [[Antagony (Transformers)|Antagony]] and [[Cataclysm (Transformers)|Cataclysm]], to safeguard the Dark Essence, only for Antagony to be captured by [[Megatron#Beast Wars|Megatron]]'s [[Predacons]] and Cataclysm to perish in battle with the Maximal hero Windrazor. Shokaract travels back in time to secure the Essence and destroy the Maximals, only to be engaged in battle by the [[Covenant of Primus#The Organization|Covenant of Primus]]. With the aid of other Transformers from across time and space, the Covenant succeeds in defeating Shokaract, and the Dark Essence of Unicron is drawn back into time, erasing Shokaract's timeline.

===IDW Publishing===
While writer [[Simon Furman]] had ruled out Unicron in the main IDW G1 series, this did not prevent him from using Unicron in his ''Beast Wars'' series. The series opens with a disembodied [[Magmatron]], trapped in temporal limbo by [[Razorbeast]] at the end of ''The Gathering'', watching the annihilation of the future Cybertron by a new version of Shokaract and Unicron. Unicron appears in spectral form in issue #2, dispatching Rartorata to Earth to stop an anomaly in the timestream (the disembodied [[Magmatron]]) from interfering in the "ascending". Unicron plans to use Shokaract as a vessel through which to reemerge into the universe and destroy Cybertron. His plans are foiled when an unlikely alliance of Maximals and Predacons succeed in battling his Heralds. Meanwhile, [[Ravage (Transformers)|Ravage]] transports Shokaract into Magmatron's limbo realm. Realizing the truth of Unicron's intentions, Shokaract kills himself.

In the official [[Hasbro Comic Book Universe]] by IDW, Unicron debuts at the end of ''[[First Strike (IDW Publishing)|First Strike]]'', having been awakened by [[General Joseph Colton|Joe Colton's]] invasion against Cybertron.

===Binaltech===
In the ''[[Binaltech]]'' saga, the future [[Ravage (Transformers)|Ravage]] seen in ''[[Beast Wars]]'' alters the [[The Transformers: The Movie|original G1 timeline]]. His interference includes trapping all the Decepticons in a spatial rift, with the knowledge that Unicron will soon attack Cybertron. He plans for the Autobots to face Unicron unaided, and the Decepticons to return and conquer whoever prevailed. As a result of these changes, the final showdown between [[Optimus Prime]] and [[Megatron (Transformers)|Megatron]] does not occur, and Prime does not die. With Megatron trapped in the rift, Unicron does not encounter the Decepticon leader, and therefore does not [[deal with the Devil|Faustian Pact]] to reformat him into [[Galvatron]].

Through the events of the story, Optimus Prime learns that the Matrix can destroy Unicron, and he and [[Ultra Magnus]] launch an assault on the giant. Within Unicron's body, Optimus Prime is severely damaged and passes the Matrix to Magnus, who completes the mission, and the pair escape as Unicron explodes.

===3H Enterprises===
Unicron again appears as a character in the ''[[Transformers: Universe]]'' comics by 3H Enterprises, seemingly the same Unicron as seen in Armada. This time he can  physically eat planets as in Generation 1. Set after ''Beast Wars'' and ''Beast Machines'', and his defeat by [[Wreckers (Transformers)|the Wreckers]], he gathers Transformers from across different realities to create an army. He forces them to fight inside Unicron, where he feasts on both the excess Energon they give off and the Sparks of the losers. In response to this, [[Primus (Transformers)|Primus]] and [[Alpha Trion]] resurrect and reformat [[Optimus Primal]] to lead the fight against the evil Unicron. After freeing Unicron's captives, the Chaos-Bringer gathers an army of his own, dubbed "the Decepticons", to fight against Primus. The army is led by [[Razorclaw]], an alternate version of [[Tigerhawk]], and consists of alternate versions of [[Obsidian (Transformers)|Obsidian]], [[Tankor]], and [[Reptilion]].

Although the end of ''Universe'' did not provide a proper conclusion to the storyline, the Cybertron Club Comic portrayed the ending. In "Revelations, Part 2", when [[Optimus Prime (Robots in Disguise)|Optimus Prime]] is called to another dimension to fight Unicron's heralds, he reflects back on the final battle between Primus's forces and Unicron's army. Unicron suddenly disappeared, his existence ended by the black hole created by his defeat in ''Transformers: Energon''.

===Fun Publications===
The Transformers club comic further developed Unicron's story for the ''Cybertron'' era, attempting to fill in plot holes. The comic states that Primus' chosen task in Energon is to imprison and burn away Unicron's disembodied spark within a fledgling sun. This sun is the one that was born to save Alpha-Q's world. Megatron's spark, also inside, interferes and the sun collapses, trapping Unicron's spark inside (bridging it between other universes). The black hole is born, and Megatron freed. He uses pieces of Unicron to remake his body, as well as revive [[Starscream (Unicron Trilogy)|Starscream]], his most loyal subject. The black hole begins to devour space and time, unraveling historical events and building new ones. This is the reason for the "errors" in the Cybertron animated series, as it is following a constantly reshaping universe.

A new Unicron toy was released at the end of the ''Cybertron'' toy line as a Deluxe-class figure with a tank-like alternate mode. Although the character did not appear in ''Transformers: Cybertron'' or its Japanese equivalent ''Transformers: Galaxy Force'', the Hasbro Club comic served to introduce this new version of the Chaos-Bringer. In this story, the black hole contains Unicron's essence and links him simultaneously to all Cybertrons across the Multiverse, giving him the potential to wipe out Primus in one fell swoop. This course is held at bay by Transformers from across the Multiverse, usually consisting of characters derived from Convention and Club exclusives as well as ''Cybertron'' figures that play no role in the television series. In one issue, [[Soundwave (Transformers)|Soundwave]] is dispatched to Cybertron after [[Ramjet (Transformers)|Ramjet]] and Nemesis Prime's failure. He tosses the [[Autobot Matrix of Leadership#Dead Matrix|Dead Matrix]] into the black hole, releasing Unicron's spark which quickly overtakes a nearby world, converting its inhabitants into savage maniacs. With the destruction of the planet his body is reborn as a normal sized Transformer.

When Unicron attacks Cybertron in the midst of the chaos caused by a Mini-Con civil war, [[Sentinel Maximus]] and [[Omega Prime]] fight him off with the help of their allies. In the end Unicron is driven off, badly wounded, by Primus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic| writer =[[Forest Lee]] and [[Dan Khanna]] | penciller =[[Forest Lee]] | title = [[Transformers: Cybertron: Balancing Act]]| volume = 1| issue = 1| date = April 2007| publisher = IDW Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unicron appears in a flashback in "The Coming Storm: Part 1". "Ask Vector Prime" later revealed that Unicron's ties to Planet X stretched back years, the planet having once been the remnants of Unicron's body from the events of ''The Transformers: The Movie'', which were blasted into another universe. Ending up on the edge of the Sol system, Unicron attempted to repair himself but was hindered by the actions of the Megatron of that universe. In response, Unicron reformatted his former victims in order to use them to accelerate his reconstruction; they soon converted him into a dimension-hopping battle station and attacked another reality. However, the Autobots of that reality struck back using the power of Zodiac energy, driving Unicron's lifeforce from Planet X and splitting it in two, creating a paradise world that remained behind in the attacked reality and a damaged husk that was eventually destroyed by the inhabitants of Gigantion.

In the comic "Hoist the Flag", set centuries later, Unicron's head proves to be the objective sought by the Star Seeker pirates under Cannonball, whose crew includes a version of Shokaract known as the Hunter.

In "Another Light", Unicron, Primus, and the Thirteen cease to be multiversal singularities, instead existing as multiple separate individuals throughout the multiverse. This results in a Unicron in the Shattered Glass universe who is wholly good, with a counterpart Primus who is entirely evil. The noble Unicron comes across the broken Autobot forces of Optimus Prime, and offers them a chance to be reborn and enlightened. As a result, Optimus Prime is reborn as [[Nova Prime]] while his fellow Autobots are likewise reformatted. They return to Cybertron and overthrow Rodimus Prime.

In association with the Fun Publications' storyline, "Ask [[Vector Prime]]" also included information on Unicron. This included introducing a version of him from the ''[[Transformers: Robots in Disguise (2001 TV series)|Robots in Disguise]]'' universe who was notably distinct from his alternate selves. Having once been the tank-alt-moded ruler of Planet X, he eventually fused himself together with the planetoid and took on his more familiar form from Generation 1 and other continuities.

===Titan Magazines===

Note: Information in ''italics'' occur in the alternate storyline where Megatron wins the battle for the Allspark.
 
''Cybertron's status is unknown, mostly abandoned as it began to die. [[Stockade (Transformers)|Stockade]] and a group of Decepticons remain, staying alive by using [[Nucleon]]. Stockade believes they can renew Cybertron by summoning a new power source, one related to the AllSpark. They succeed in summoning such an energy being, which enters Cybertron to renew it. To everyone's horror, it announces itself as Unicron. ''

''The possessed Cybertron is swiftly altered into a form with a large mouth and grasping prongs, turned hostile to those on it, and warped to the Sol system. The Autobots and Decepticons are able to destroy Unicron, but Cybertron is left in its transformed state and seemingly in the Sol system, as well as dead and powerless.''

''When the Autobots are ordered off American soil, they regroup ''under'' Cybertron and begin working on the teleportation engines that Unicron left there when he transformed the planet. Using these, they make a decisive strike by teleporting the entire Decepticon army to Cybertron, then teleporting ''Cybertron'' to the far reaches of space. With the engines burnt out and no energy on the planet, the Decepticons are marooned there, at the cost of the Autobots never being able to go home.''

===Unite Warriors===
In conjunction with the Unite Warriors line, [[Takara Tomy]] released a comic detailing how the '''Galvatronus''' combiner came to be. Following his defeat at the conclusion of ''The Headmasters'', Galvatron's icy tomb is discovered by Cyclonus, whose body Galvatron modifies to accommodate his own head in the chest compartment. Seeking a more fitting form, Galvatron directs Cyclonus to approach the disembodied head of Unicron, who is convinced to help Galvatron attain a combiner form with Cyclonus as its core. To accomplish this, Unicron opens dimensional rifts in order to bring [[Thrust (Transformers)|Curse Armada Thrust]], [[Breakdown (Transformers)|Zombie War Breakdown]], and [[Roller (Transformers)|Wandering Roller]] into their world. To Cyclonus' surprise, [[Starscream]] makes an appearance, expressing interest in joining this new alliance. Unicron  grants Starscream a new physical form, and Galvatron's head takes control of his new minions to take on his new form of Galvatronus.&lt;ref&gt;http://takaratomymall.jp/shop/g/g4904810864769/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transformers Cinematic Universe==
{{further information|Transformers (film series)}}

Debuting in ''[[Transformers: The Last Knight]]'', the six horns of Unicron began appearing out of the [[Earth]] in response to the approach of [[Cybertron]]. Unicron is noted by Quintessa to be another name for Earth, and Optimus Prime recognises Unicron as Cybertron's ancient enemy. Quintessa plans to drain Unicron's energy to restore the damaged Cybertron, killing life on Earth in the process. Simmons later helps Burton locate an ancient book containing details about Unicron, noting that the centre-point of Unicron's horns (during the era when all of Earth's continents formed [[Pangea]]) is [[Stonehenge]]. Megatron and Quintessa begin draining energy from Unicron, but are foiled, and later Quintessa (disguised as a human) approaches a scientist studying one of Unicron's horns to warn him not to touch the chaos-bringer and offer a way to kill him.

==Games==
Unicron is among the characters appearing in the 2004 ''[[Transformers (2004 video game)|Transformers]]'' video game for the [[PlayStation 2]].&lt;ref&gt;Atari Begins the ``Ultimate Conflict'' with Worldwide Release of 'TRANSFORMERS' Video Game, Business Wire, May 12, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Unicron begins attacking Cybertron, requiring the Autobots to collect enough Mini-cons to create a power-up mode for Optimus Prime. The player must chase Unicron as he orbits around Cybertron and enter his maw as he prepares to fire, blasting him with the Matrix Cannon until eventually Unicron is destroyed.

Unicron is mentioned a number of times in ''[[Transformers: Prime {{ndash}} The Game]]''. Eons ago, Unicron created [[Thunderwing]] to serve him and destroy the Matrix of Leadership. After Unicron's demise a meteor of Dark Energon with Thunderwing sealed within crashes on Earth. [[Optimus Prime]] comes across the meteor and finds Thunderwing who reveals that he is a minion of Unicron and his mission was to destroy the Matrix. Thunderwing seeks help from the Decepticons for the repairs needed. He fails thanks to the combined efforts of Prime and [[Jack Darby]] and falls into a volcano.

==Books==
Unicron is mentioned a number of times in the novels ''[[Transformers: Exodus]], [[Transformers: Exiles]]'' and ''[[Transformers: Retribution]]''. Unicron is defeated in his attempt to destroy Cybertron early in its history, but emanations of his presence remain and are gathered and stored on [[Trypticon]] Station. This substance is a violently addictive poison that can pass on to another bot once its user dies, and is dubbed the Sparks of Unicron or [[Dark Energon]]. Ultimately [[Megatron]] contaminates the core with Dark Energon, forcing the planet to shut down and reboot. Unicron's name is used by the Decepticons as an oath, and they seem to hold him in a sense of reverence similar to how the Autobots regard Primus. The Quintessons, during their attempt to convince Megatron that they could deliver a Decepticon Matrix of Leadership to him, indicate that the artifact was created by Unicron.

==Toys==
* '''''Generation 1'' Unicron''' (unreleased)
:A prototype was created for a Unicron toy as far back as 1986, but owing to cost concerns, it never made it into production.

* '''''Beast Wars Neo'' Unicron''' (unreleased)
:A giant, top heavy Unicron toy with a "shell" type transformation intended for release in Japan circa 2000, which exists only as a prototype.

* '''''Armada'' Unicron with Dead End''' (2003)
:The ''Armada'' figure came with its own Mini-Con, which transforms into a cannon-equipped 'moon' to Unicron's 'planet', looking very similar to the [[Death Star]] of [[Star Wars]] fame. At various points in production, Unicron's Mini-Con was originally going to be called [[Nebulos|Nebulon]], the name of the homeworld of the [[Headmaster (Transformers)|Headmaster]], [[Targetmaster]] and [[Powermasters|Powermaster]] partners, and also Gobotron, the homeworld of the Transformers' competitive toyline in the 80's, the [[Challenge of the GoBots|Go-Bots]]. Designer Aaron Archer did not want such a historical action figure to be overshadowed by a Go-Bots pun, so the name was changed to [[Dead End (Transformers)|Dead End]], re-using a name of one of the original [[Stunticon]]s. A multitude of these Mini-Cons were featured in the ''Armada'' cartoon, although they were portrayed simply as non-transforming internal defensive "laser pods," instead of actual Mini-Cons.
:This toy was voted the 52nd top toy released in the last 10 years by ''[[ToyFare]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Toyfare Magazine issue #122&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''''Micron Legend'' Lucky Draw Unicron with Bug''' (2003)
:A green redeco of the ''Armada'' Unicron, limited to 10 units and given away as part of the ''Micron Legend Yearbook 2003'' mail-in contest in Japan.

* '''''Energon'' Unicron with Dead End''' (2004)
:A redeco of the Armada toy.

* '''''Energon'' McDonald's Unicron''' (2004)
:Given away as a [[Happy Meal]] toy in Europe and Australia.

* '''''Cybertron'' Deluxe Unicron''' (2005)
:A Deluxe size figure. The figure was packaged on a Decepticon cardback, and that the character's profile in the ''Transformers Collectors' Club'' magazine also included a Decepticon symbol. The actual story featuring the character, however, presents him as unaffiliated, serving only his own ends. In line with this, the toy lacks a faction symbol - a rare but not unheard of occurrence in the Transformers line, with examples including [[Micromasters]], the [[Generation 2]] [[Go-Bots]], ''Cybertron'' Safeguard, SDCC exclusive [[Skywarp]], and movie [[Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen|Armorhide]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080212051144/http://www.hasbro.com/default.cfm?page=browse&amp;product_id=17827 TRANSFORMERS CYBERTRON Deluxe Class: UNICRON Figure- Product Detail&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seibertron.com/transformers/toys/cybertron/unicron/908/1/8/ |title=Unicron - Toy Gallery - Photo #9 |publisher=Seibertron.com |accessdate=2012-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Designed to resemble Unicron as seen in ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]'', pre-release photos issued by Takara Tomy show a new head and changes to the molding of the torso, as well as deco based on his movie appearance.

&lt;!-- Note: DO NOT REMOVE AND/OR ALTER "Decepticons" CATEGORY FROM THIS SECTION PLEASE. This has been discussed on the talk page for years, and the conclusion is to include Unicron in the category Decepticons because both Hasbro and official Transformers comics publishers have included some incarnations of Unicron as a Decepticon.
