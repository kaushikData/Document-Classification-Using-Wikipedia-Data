In [[physical cosmology]], the '''age of the universe''' is the [[cosmological time|time]] elapsed since the [[Big Bang]]. The [[Planck (spacecraft)#2015 data release|current measurement]] of the age of the [[universe]] is {{val|13.799|0.021}} billion (10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;) years&lt;!-- The universe is 8.07×10E60 "planck times" old, this is how much the observable universe has "ticked" since the plank epoch.
For reference, if we took a "supercomputer" capable of counting at plank speed, and have it count since the Big bang, it would have counted a number 203 bits long by now. (1.25×2E202) --&gt; within the [[Lambda-CDM model|Lambda-CDM concordance model]].&lt;ref name="Planck 2015"&gt;{{Cite journal

These include studies of the [[microwave background radiation]], and [[measurement]]s by the [[Planck satellite]], the [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] and other probes.

== Explanation ==
The [[Lambda-CDM model|Lambda-CDM concordance model]] describes the evolution of the universe from a very uniform, hot, dense primordial state to its present state over a span of about 13.8 billion years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[cosmological time]]. This model is well understood theoretically and strongly supported by recent high-precision [[astronomical observation]]s such as [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe|WMAP]]. In contrast, theories of the origin of the primordial state remain very speculative. If one extrapolates the Lambda-CDM model backward from the earliest well-understood state, it quickly (within a small fraction of a second) reaches a [[Gravitational singularity|singularity]]. This is known as the "[[initial singularity]]" or the "[[Big Bang]] singularity". This singularity is not understood as having a physical significance in the usual sense, but it is convenient to quote times measured "since the Big Bang" even though they do not correspond to a physically measurable time. For example, "10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang" is a well-defined era in the universe's evolution. If one referred to the same era as "13.8 billion years minus 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; seconds ago", the precision of the meaning would be lost because the minuscule latter time interval is eclipsed by uncertainty in the former.

Though the universe might in theory have a longer history, the [[International Astronomical Union]]&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; presently use "age of the universe" to mean the duration of the Lambda-CDM expansion, or equivalently the elapsed time since the Big Bang in the current [[observable universe]].

==Observational limits==
Since the universe must be at least as old as the oldest things in it, there are a number of observations which put a lower limit on the age of the universe; these include the temperature of the coolest [[white dwarf]]s, which gradually cool as they age, and the dimmest [[turnoff point]] of [[main sequence]] [[stars]] in clusters (lower-mass stars spend a greater amount of time on the main sequence, so the lowest-mass stars that have evolved off of the main sequence set a minimum age).

==Cosmological parameters==
[[Image:Mplwp universe scale evolution.svg|thumb|400px|The age of the universe can be determined by measuring the [[Hubble constant]] today and extrapolating back in time with the observed value of density parameters (Ω). Before the discovery of [[dark energy]], it was believed that the universe was matter-dominated ([[Einstein–de Sitter universe]], green curve). Note that the [[de Sitter universe]] has infinite age, while the [[Big Crunch|closed]] universe has the least age.]]
[[File:Age Universe Planck 2013.png|thumb|400px|The value of the age correction factor, ''F'', is shown as a function of two [[cosmology|cosmological parameters]]: the current fractional matter density Ω&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; and cosmological constant density Ω&lt;sub&gt;''Λ''&lt;/sub&gt;.  The [[Lambda-CDM model|best-fit values]] of these parameters are shown by the box in the upper left; the matter-dominated universe is shown by the star in the lower right.]]
The problem of determining the age of the universe is closely tied to the problem of determining the values of the cosmological parameters. Today this is largely carried out in the context of the [[Lambda CDM model|ΛCDM]] model, where the universe is assumed to contain normal (baryonic) matter, cold [[dark matter]], radiation (including both [[photon]]s and [[neutrino]]s), and a [[cosmological constant]].  The fractional contribution of each to the current energy density of the universe is given by the [[density parameter]]s Ω&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;, Ω&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;, and Ω&lt;sub&gt;Λ&lt;/sub&gt;.  The full ΛCDM model is described by a number of other parameters, but for the purpose of computing its age these three, along with the [[Hubble constant|Hubble parameter]] &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt;, are the most important.

If one has accurate measurements of these parameters, then the age of the universe can be determined by using the [[Friedmann equations|Friedmann equation]].  This equation relates the rate of change in the [[scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]] ''a''(''t'') to the matter content of the universe.  Turning this relation around, we can calculate the change in time per change in scale factor and thus calculate the total age of the universe by [[Integral|integrating]] this formula. The age ''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is then given by an expression of the form
:&lt;math&gt;t_0 = \frac{1}{H_0} F(\Omega_r,\Omega_m,\Omega_\Lambda,\dots) &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Hubble's law|Hubble parameter]] and the function ''F'' depends only on the fractional contribution to the universe's energy content that comes from various components. The first observation that one can make from this formula is that it is the Hubble parameter that controls that age of the universe, with a correction arising from the matter and energy content. So a rough estimate of the age of the universe comes from the [[Hubble time]], the inverse of the Hubble parameter. With a value for &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; around {{val|68|u=km/s/Mpc}}, the Hubble time evaluates to &lt;math&gt;1/H_0&lt;/math&gt; = {{val|14.4}} billion years.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To get a more accurate number, the correction factor ''F'' must be computed. In general this must be done numerically, and the results for a range of cosmological parameter values are shown in the figure. For the [[Lambda CDM model|Planck values]] (Ω&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;, Ω&lt;sub&gt;''Λ''&lt;/sub&gt;) = (0.3086, 0.6914), shown by the box in the upper left corner of the figure, this correction factor is about ''F'' = 0.956. For a flat universe without any cosmological constant, shown by the star in the lower right corner, ''F'' = {{Frac|2|3}} is much smaller and thus the universe is younger for a fixed value of the Hubble parameter. To make this figure, Ω&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; is held constant (roughly equivalent to holding the [[Cosmic Microwave Background|CMB]] temperature constant) and the curvature density parameter is fixed by the value of the other three.

Apart from the Planck satellite, the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe ([[WMAP]]) was instrumental in establishing an accurate age of the universe, though other measurements must be folded in to gain an accurate number.  [[CMB]] measurements are very good at constraining the matter content Ω&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not as sensitive to Ω&lt;sub&gt;Λ&lt;/sub&gt; directly,&lt;ref name="anim3"/&gt; partly because the cosmological constant becomes important only at low redshift.  The most accurate determinations of the Hubble parameter ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; come from [[Type Ia supernova]]e.  Combining these measurements leads to the generally accepted value for the age of the universe quoted above.

The cosmological constant makes the universe "older" for fixed values of the other parameters. This is significant, since before the cosmological constant became generally accepted, the Big Bang model had difficulty explaining why [[globular cluster]]s in the Milky Way appeared to be far older than the age of the universe as calculated from the Hubble parameter and a matter-only universe.&lt;ref&gt;

==WMAP==
[[NASA]]'s [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] (WMAP) project's [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe#Nine-year data release|nine-year data release]] in 2012 estimated the age of the universe to be {{val|13.772|0.059|e=9}} years (13.772 billion years, with an uncertainty of plus or minus 59 million years).&lt;ref name="arxiv-20121220" /&gt;

However, this age is based on the assumption that the project's underlying model is correct; other methods of estimating the age of the universe could give different ages. Assuming an extra background of relativistic particles, for example, can enlarge the error bars of the WMAP constraint by one order of magnitude.&lt;ref&gt;

This measurement is made by using the location of the first acoustic peak in the [[cosmic microwave background radiation|microwave background]] power spectrum to determine the size of the decoupling surface (size of the universe at the time of recombination).  The light travel time to this surface (depending on the geometry used) yields a reliable age for the universe.  Assuming the validity of the models used to determine this age, the residual accuracy yields a margin of error near one percent.&lt;ref name="wmap"&gt;

==Assumption of strong priors==
Calculating the age of the universe is accurate only if the assumptions built into the models being used to estimate it are also accurate. This is referred to as [[strong priors]] and essentially involves stripping the potential errors in other parts of the model to render the accuracy of actual observational data directly into the concluded result.  Although this is not a valid procedure in all contexts (as noted in the accompanying caveat: "based on the fact we have assumed the underlying model we used is correct"{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}&lt;!--no reason to doubt this, but quotation should be cited--&gt;), the age given is thus accurate to the specified error (since this error represents the error in the instrument used to gather the raw data input into the model).

The age of the universe based on the best fit to [[Planck (spacecraft)#2015 data release|Planck 2015 data]] alone is {{val|13.813|0.038}} billion years (the estimate of {{val|13.799|0.021}} billion years uses Gaussian [[Prior probability|prior]]s based on earlier estimates from other studies to determine the combined uncertainty). This number represents an accurate "direct" measurement of the age of the universe (other methods typically involve [[Hubble's law]] and the age of the oldest stars in globular clusters, etc.). It is possible to use different methods for determining the same parameter (in this case – the age of the universe) and arrive at different answers with no overlap in the "errors". To best avoid the problem, it is common to show two sets of uncertainties; one related to the actual measurement and the other related to the systematic errors of the model being used.

An important component to the analysis of data used to determine the age of the universe (e.g. from [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]]) therefore is to use a [[Bayesian statistics|Bayesian statistical]] analysis, which normalizes the results based upon the priors (i.e. the model).&lt;ref name="wmap" /&gt; This quantifies any uncertainty in the accuracy of a measurement due to a particular model used.&lt;ref&gt;

==History==
{{Nature timeline}}

{{main|Cosmic age problem|Cosmic microwave background}}
In the 18th century, the concept that the [[age of the Earth]] was millions, if not billions, of years began to appear. However, most scientists throughout the 19th century and into the first decades of the 20th century presumed that the universe itself was [[Steady State theory|Steady State]] and eternal, with maybe stars coming and going but no changes occurring at the largest scale known at the time.

The first scientific theories indicating that the age of the universe might be finite were the studies of [[thermodynamics]], formalized in the mid-19th century. The concept of [[entropy]] dictates that if the universe (or any other closed system) were infinitely old, then everything inside would be at the same temperature, and thus there would be no stars and no life. No scientific explanation for this contradiction was put forth at the time.

In 1915 [[Albert Einstein]] published the theory of [[general relativity]]&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
 |last=Einstein |first=A.
 |date=1915
 |title=Zur allgemeinen Relativitätstheorie

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1917 constructed the first [[cosmological model]] based on his theory. In order to remain consistent with a steady state universe, Einstein added what was later called a [[cosmological constant]] to his equations. However, already in 1922, also using  Einstein's theory, [[Alexander Friedmann]], and independently five years later [[Georges Lemaître]], showed that the universe cannot be static and must be either expanding or contracting. Einstein's model of a static universe was in addition proved unstable by [[Arthur Eddington]].

The first direct observational hint that the universe has a finite age came from the observations of '[[recession velocity|recession velocities]]', mostly by [[Vesto Slipher]], combined with distances to the '[[nebula]]e' ([[galaxy|galaxies]]) by [[Edwin Hubble]] in a  work published in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier in the 20th century, Hubble and others resolved individual stars within certain nebulae, thus determining that they were galaxies, similar to, but external to, our [[Milky Way Galaxy]]. In addition, these galaxies were very large and very far away. [[electromagnetic spectrum|Spectra]] taken of these distant galaxies showed a [[red shift]] in their [[spectral lines]] presumably caused by the [[Doppler effect]], thus indicating that these galaxies were moving away from the Earth. In addition, the farther away these galaxies seemed to be (the dimmer they appeared to us) the greater was their redshift, and thus the faster they seemed to be moving away. This was the first direct evidence that the universe is not static but expanding. The first estimate of the age of the universe came from the calculation of when all of the objects must have started speeding out from the same point. Hubble's initial value for the universe's age was very low, as the galaxies were assumed to be much closer than later observations found them to be.

The first reasonably accurate measurement of the rate of expansion of the universe, a numerical value now known as the [[Hubble constant]], was made in 1958 by astronomer [[Allan Sandage]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
 |last1=Sandage |first1=A. R.
 |title=Current Problems in the Extragalactic Distance Scale
 |date=1958

 |volume=127 |issue=3 |pages=513–526
 |bibcode=1958ApJ...127..513S
 |doi=10.1086/146483
}}&lt;/ref&gt; His measured value for the Hubble constant came very close to the value range generally accepted today.

However Sandage, like Einstein, did not believe his own results at the time of discovery. His value for the age of the universe{{Elucidate|date=February 2014|reason=What was his value for the age of the universe?}} was too short to reconcile with the 25-billion-year age estimated at that time for the oldest known [[star]]s. Sandage and other astronomers repeated these measurements numerous times, attempting to reduce the [[Hubble constant]] and thus increase the resulting age for the universe. Sandage even proposed new theories of [[cosmogony]] to explain this discrepancy. This issue was finally resolved by improvements in the theoretical models used for estimating the ages of stars. As of 2013, using the latest models for stellar evolution, the estimated age of the [[oldest star|oldest known star]] is {{val|14.46|0.8}} billion years.&lt;ref name=arxiv&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; finally brought an effective end to the remaining scientific uncertainty over the expanding universe. It was a chance result from work by two teams less than 60 miles apart.  In 1964, [[Arno Allan Penzias|Arno Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson|Robert Wilson]] were trying to detect [[radio wave]] [[echo]]es with a supersensitive antenna. The antenna persistently detected a low, steady, mysterious [[noise (electronics)|noise]] in the [[microwave radiation|microwave region]] that was evenly spread over the sky, and was present day and night. After testing, they became certain that the signal did not come from the [[Earth]], the [[Sun]], or [[Milky Way|our galaxy]], but from outside our own galaxy, but could not explain it. At the same time another team, [[Robert H. Dicke]], [[P. J. E. Peebles|Jim Peebles]], and [[David Todd Wilkinson|David Wilkinson]], were attempting to detect low level noise which might be left over from the [[Big Bang]] and could prove whether the Big Bang theory was correct. The two teams realized that the detected noise was in fact radiation left over from the Big Bang, and that this was strong evidence that the theory was correct. Since then, a great deal of other evidence has strengthened and confirmed this conclusion, and refined the estimated age of the universe to its current figure.

The space probes WMAP, launched in 2001, and [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]], launched in 2009, produced data that determines the Hubble constant and the age of the universe independent of galaxy distances, removing the largest source of error.&lt;ref name="wmap"/&gt;

'''Ahmad bin Muhammad bin al-Siddiq al-Ghumari''' was a Muslim traditionist and scholar of [[Hadith]] from Morocco.&lt;ref&gt;Mustafa Shah, ''The Hạdīth: Scholarship, perspectives, and criticism'', Routledge, 2010, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Ghumari was born on the 27th of [[Ramadan]] in 1320 according to the [[Islamic calendar]], corresponding to December 26, 1902 [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]].&lt;ref name=birth/&gt; He was the older brother of fellow clerics [[Abdullah al-Ghumari]] and [[Abd al-Aziz al-Ghumari]]. As a child, he studied in Morocco's traditional [[madrasa]] system, [[Hafiz (Qur'an)|memorizing]] the entire [[Qur'an]] by heart, in addition to traditional Islamic texts such as [[Alfiya]], [[Ajārūmīya]] and [[Bulugh al-Maram]].

In 1921, he traveled to [[Egypt]] and enrolled in [[Al-Azhar University]], returning to Morocco upon the death of his father.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} Ghumari went to Egypt a second time in 1931 when his younger brothers Abdullah and Muhammad also enrolled in the university. Due to fears regarding activity of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] in Egypt, his brother Abdullah was sentenced to ten years in prison on accusations of ties to the group in 1961. Ahmad al-Ghumari, upon hearing the news of his younger brother's long sentence, fell ill and died eight months later.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

==Career==
Ghumari was a prolific writer, having authored more than one-hundred books. He was well known for a debate which acrimoniously began between him and fellow hadith scholar [[Muhammad Nasiruddin al-Albani]], and later continued with between Ghumari's younger brother Abdullah and Albani.&lt;ref name=moin&gt;Muhammad Moin, [http://alsonnah.wordpress.com/2011/03/08/ahmed-al-ghumari-on-al-albani/ "Ahmed Al-Ghumari on Al-Albani"]. ''Al-Sunnah'': 8 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the older Ghumari's attestation to Albani's high level of knowledge and respected status in [[Hadith studies]], the nature of the debate between them became personal and involved character attacks.

Like the rest of his family, Ghumari was a leader of the [[Siddiqiyya]] Sufi [[Tariqa|order]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Abd al-Aziz al-Ghumari]], ''Ma Yajuz wa ma la Yajuz fi al-Hayat al-Zawjiyyah'', pg. 9. Amman: Dar al-Fath, 2009. {{ISBN|9789957231309}}&lt;/ref&gt; a branch of the larger [[Shadhili]] order.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} [[Muhammad Taqi-ud-Din al-Hilali]] claimed that al-Ghumari had chosen to live a very simple life and eschewed material excess.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hassan Kettani]], ''Fiqh al-Hafizh Ahmad bin al-Siddiq al-Ghumari'', pg. 58. [[Amman]]: Dar al-Bayariq, 2001. Jordanian National Library #2001/6/1146&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views==
Although a practitioner of [[Sufism]], Ghumari was a strong critic of many Sufis, especially the rival [[Naqshbandi]] [[Tariqa|order]].&lt;ref name=haddad&gt;[[Gibril Haddad]], [http://www.abc.se/home/m9783/ir/f/The%20Ghumari%20School.htm The Ghumari School]. 6 December 2002: Living Islam. Last updated 2 June 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Like [[Ibn Hazm]], Ghumari viewed scholarly [[Ikhtilaf|difference of opinion]] as a curse. Like his brothers, he often used harsh language when responding to intellectual opponents.&lt;ref name=moin/&gt;&lt;ref name=haddad/&gt; Having originally followed the [[Maliki]] [[Madhhab|school of thought]] like most of Muslim scholarship in Morocco, al-Ghumari later switched to the [[Shafi'i]] school for a period and finally opted for absolute [[Ijtihad|independent reasoning]].&lt;ref&gt;Hassan Kettani, ''Fiqh al-Hafizh'', pgs. 61-62.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most of Moroccan scholarship, al-Ghumari opposed the [[Ash'ari]] school of theology.&lt;ref name =kett62&gt;Hassan Kettani, ''Fiqh al-Hafizh'', pg. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muhammad Abu Khubza]], among other Moroccan scholars, also claim that al-Ghumari temporarily adhered to the [[Zaidiyyah]] school of [[Shia Islam]].&lt;ref name =kett62/&gt;

'''Animal migration''' is the relatively long-distance movement of individual animals, usually on a seasonal basis. It is the most common form of [[Migration (ecology)|migration]] in ecology. It is found in all major animal groups, including [[Bird migration|birds]], mammals&lt;!--wl to [[Mammal migration]], not to mammals--&gt;, [[Fish migration|fish]], reptiles, amphibians, [[Insect migration|insects]], and crustaceans.&lt;ref name="DingleDrake"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dingle, Hugh |author2=Drake, V.

==Overview==
[[File:Christmas Red Crab.JPG |thumb|A [[Christmas Island red crab]] on its migration]]

Migration can take very different forms in different species, and as such there is no simple accepted definition of migration.  One of the most commonly used definitions, proposed by Kennedy&lt;ref name=Kennedy&gt;{{cite book | author=Kennedy, J. S. | editor=Rankin, M. | title=Migration: Mechanisms and Adaptive Significance: Contributions in Marine Science | year=1985 | publisher=Marine Science Institute | pages=5–26 | chapter=Migration: Behavioral and ecological}}&lt;/ref&gt; is

{{quote|Migratory behavior is persistent and straightened out movement effected by the animal’s own locomotory exertions or by its active embarkation upon a vehicle. It depends on some temporary inhibition of station keeping responses but promotes their eventual disinhibition and recurrence.&lt;ref name=Kennedy/&gt;}}

Migration encompasses four related concepts: persistent straight movement; relocation of an individual on a greater scale (both spatially and temporally) than its normal daily activities; seasonal to-and-fro movement of a population between two areas; and movement leading to the redistribution of individuals within a population.&lt;ref name="DingleDrake"/&gt; Migration can be either [[obligate]], meaning individuals must  migrate, or [[facultative]], meaning individuals can "choose" to migrate or not. Within a migratory species or even within a single population, often not all individuals migrate.  ''Complete migration'' is when all individuals migrate, ''partial migration'' is when some individuals migrate while others do not, and ''differential migration'' is when the difference between migratory and non-migratory individuals is based on age or sex (for example).&lt;ref name="DingleDrake"/&gt;

While most migratory movements occur on an annual cycle, some daily movements are also referred to as migration. Many aquatic animals make a [[Diel vertical migration]], travelling a few hundred meters up and down the water column,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=McLaren, I.A. | year=1974 | title=Demographic strategy of vertical migration by a marine copepod. | journal=The American Naturalist | volume=108 | issue=959 | pages=91–102 | jstor=2459738 | doi=10.1086/282887}}&lt;/ref&gt; while some jellyfish make daily horizontal migrations, traveling a few hundred meters across a lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hamner, W.M. |author2=Hauri, I.R. | year=1981 |title=Long-distance horizontal migrations of zooplankton (Scyphomedusae: Mastigias). |journal=Limnology and Oceanography | volume=26 | issue=3 | pages=414–423 | doi=10.4319/lo.1981.26.3.0414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irregular (non-cyclical) migrations such as [[irruption]]s can occur under pressure of famine, overpopulation of a locality, or some more obscure influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Migration |author=[[Ernest Ingersoll|Ingersoll, Ernest]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seasonal migration is the movement of various species from one habitat to another during the year. Resource availability changes depending on seasonal fluctuations, which influence migration patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Seasonal Migration. Environmental Science: In Context. 2009 [accessed 2018 Apr 27]. https://www.encyclopedia.com/environment/energy-government-and-defense-magazines/seasonal-migration&lt;/ref&gt; Different species also might migrate for reproductive purposes. Pacific salmon is an example of a species migrating to reproduce. Every year pacific salmon travel upstream to mate and then return to the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;About Pacific Salmon. Pacific Salmon Commission. [accessed 2018 May 1]. http://www.psc.org/about-us/history-purpose/about-pacific-salmon/&lt;/ref&gt; Temperature is also a driving factor of migration that is dependent on the time of year. Many species, especially birds, migrate to warmer locations during the winter to escape poor environmental conditions.&lt;ref&gt;The Basics of Bird Migration: How, Why, and Where. All About Birds. 2007 Jan 1 [accessed 2018 May 1]. https://www.allaboutbirds.org/the-basics-how-why-and-where-of-bird-migration/&lt;/ref&gt;

Circadian Migration is where birds utilize  circadian rhythm (CR) to regulate migration in both the fall and the spring. In circadian migration clocks of both circadian (daily) and circannual (annual) patterns are utilized to determine the birds’ orientation in both time and space as they migrate from one destination to the next.&lt;ref name="Gwinner E 2018"&gt;Gwinner E, Circadian and circannual programmes in avian migration (2018), Journal of Experimental Biology, (199), Pg: 39–48 (Accessed April 26, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; This type of migration serves as being advantageous in birds that during the winter remain close to the equator and also to monitor the auditory and spatial memory of the birds’ brain to remember an optimal site of migration.&lt;ref name="Gwinner E 2018"/&gt; These birds also possess timing programs that provide avians with the distance that bird have to travel in order to reach their destination.&lt;ref name="Gwinner E 2018"/&gt; To regulate the migration patterns of these birds, the mammalian circadian clock is utilized. This clock serves to allow for the avians to determine when the appropriate time is to migrate and which site will allow the birds to regulate their metabolism to see if traveling by either land or water will serve as being most advantageous for these migrating species.&lt;ref&gt;Boucher H, Vanneaux V, Domet T, Parouchev A, and Larghero J, Circadian Clock Genes Modulate Human Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cell Differentiation, Migration and Cell Cycle, (2016), NCBI, 11(1): Pg: 1–16 (Accessed April 26, 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

Tidal Migration is the use of tides by organisms to move periodically from one habitat to another. This type of migration is often used in order to find food or mates. Tides can carry organisms horizontally and vertically for as little as a few nanometers to even thousands of kilometers.&lt;ref name="Gibson R 2003"&gt;Gibson R, Go with the flow: tidal migration in marine animals (2003), Hydrobiologia, 503(1–3), Pg: 153–161 (Accessed April 26, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; The most common form of tidal migration is to and from [[Intertidal zone]] during daily tidal cycles.&lt;ref name="Gibson R 2003"/&gt; These zones are often populated by many different species and are nutrient rich.  Organisms like crabs, nematodes, small fish, corals, and other species cycle to these areas as the tides rise and fall typically about every twelve hours. The cycle movements are associated with foraging of marine and bird species. Typically, during low tide smaller or younger species will emerge to forage because they can survive in the shallower water and have less chance of being preyed upon. During high tide, larger species can be found due to the deeper water and nutrient upwelling from the tidal movements.
Tidal migration is often facilitated by [[Ocean current]].&lt;ref&gt;Hufnagl M, Temming A,  Pohlmann T, The missing link: tidal-influenced activity a likely candidate to close the migration triangle in brown shrimp Crangon crangon ( Crustacea, Decapoda), 2014, Fisheries Oceanography, Pg: 242–257 (accessed April 28, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; The currents carry organisms at a faster speed than if they were to just swim. These long-distance currents often bring organisms to breeding grounds and nurseries. Breeding ground often end up being near or in intertidal zones. This occurs due to the food and nutrient richness of these areas, it makes it an ideal place for offspring to grow.

Although migration and animal [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]] are similar in that animals are moving from one less advantageous area to an area with more advantages, there are many differences between the two. In migration, an animal is moving under some form of a cycle or pattern, like seasonal, tidal, or even circadian. This can be seen in Sage sparrows, who move on a seasonal bases with the help of environmental triggers.&lt;ref&gt;Kurt A. Fesenmyer, Steven T. Knick. Seasonal Movements and Environmental Triggers to Fall Migration of Sage Spa...: Books, Articles and More. [accessed 2018 May 1]. http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/command/detail?vid=15&amp;sid=b003143c-b5d4-4fb4-b212-7716fe2e7e15%40sessionmgr4008&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=edsjsr.41480550&amp;db=edsjsr.&lt;/ref&gt; Migration is different from dispersal where the animals are moving to a new location and not returning to the original site. Dispersal is heavily reliant on chance and the organism’s ability to find a home with the necessary resources to survive. The organism may look at many places before picking a home. This ability to disperse is seen for many reasons, like social status or sex. A study by the Journal of Avian Biology found that the female bird will disperse, which is different from mammals where the male will disperse.&lt;ref&gt;Rubalcaba JG, Veiga JP, Polo V. 2017. Is offspring dispersal related to male mating status? An experiment with the facultatively polygynous spotless starling. Journal of Avian Biology. 48:203–208. doi:10.1111/jav.00974.&lt;/ref&gt; This was largely related to mating techniques and carrying for young as the female bird will take care of her eggs in solitude while female mammals will raise in a community.

==In specific groups==
[[Image:101111 Maison 007.jpg|thumb|upright|Flocks of birds assembling before migration southwards]]
Different kinds of animal migrate in different ways.

===In birds===
{{main|Bird migration}}

Approximately 1,800 of the world's 10,000 [[bird migration|bird species migrate long distances]] each year in response to the seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Conservation ecology: area trumps mobility in fragment bird extinctions | author=Sekercioglu, C.H. | journal=Current Biology | year=2007 | volume=17 | issue=8 | pages=283–286 | doi=10.1016/j.cub.2007.02.019 | pmid=17437705}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these migrations are north-south, with species feeding and breeding in high northern latitudes in the summer, and moving some hundreds of kilometres south for the winter.&lt;ref name=Berthold2001&gt;{{cite book | title=Bird Migration: A General Survey |author1=Berthold, Peter |author2=Bauer, Hans-Günther |author3=Westhead, Valerie | year=2001 | isbn=0-19-850787-9 | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some species extend this strategy to migrate annually between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The [[Arctic tern]] is famous for its migration; it flies from its [[Arctic]] breeding grounds to the [[Antarctic]] and back again each year, a distance of at least {{convert|19,000|km|mi|abbr=on}}, giving it two summers every year.&lt;ref name=Cramp&gt;{{cite book | title=Birds of the Western Palearctic | editor=Cramp, Steve | year=1985 | pages=87–100 | isbn=0-19-857507-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In fish===
{{main|Fish migration}}
[[Image:Jumping Salmon.jpg|thumb|Many species of [[salmon]] migrate up rivers to [[reproduction|spawn]]]]

Most fish species are relatively limited in their movements, remaining in a single geographical area and making short migrations for wintering, to spawn, or to feed. A few hundred species migrate long distances, in some cases of thousands of kilometres. About 120 species of fish, including several species of [[salmon]], migrate between saltwater and freshwater (they are 'diadromous').&lt;ref&gt;Harden Jones, F. R. ''Fish Migration: strategy and tactics''. pp139–166 in Aidley, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Myers 1949"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Myers | first=George S. | title=Usage of Anadromous, Catadromous and allied terms for migratory fishes | journal=Copeia | year=1949 | volume=1949 | pages=89–97 | doi=10.2307/1438482 | issue=2| jstor=1438482 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Forage fish]] such as [[herring]] and [[capelin]] migrate around substantial parts of the North [[Atlantic]] ocean. The capelin for example spawn around the southern and western coasts of Iceland; their larvae drift clockwise around Iceland, while the fish swim northwards towards [[Jan Mayen]] island to feed, and return to Iceland parallel with Greenland's east coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| authors=Barbaro, A.; Einarsson, B.; Birnir, B.; Sigurðsson, S.; Valdimarsson, S.; Pálsson, Ó.K.; Sveinbjörnsson, S.; Sigurðsson, P. |date=2009 |url=http://escholarship.ucop.edu/uc/item/1jv6n689.pdf |title=Modelling and simulations of the migration of pelagic fish |journal=Journal of Marine Science |volume=66 |issue=5 |pages=826–838}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the '[[sardine run]]', billions of Southern African [[pilchard]] ''[[Sardinops sagax]]'' spawn in the cool waters of the [[Agulhas Bank]] and move northward along the east coast of [[South Africa]] between May and July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nisc.co.za/oneAbstract?absId=3728 |title=A review and tests of hypotheses about causes of the KwaZulu-Natal sardine run |journal=African Journal of Marine Science |year=2010 |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=449–479 |doi=10.2989/1814232X.2010.519451 |last1=Fréon |first1=P. |last2=Coetzee |first2=J.C. |last3=Van Der Lingen |first3=C.D. |last4=Connell |first4=A.D. |last5=o'Donoghue |first5=S.H. |last6=Roberts |first6=M.J. |last7=Demarcq |first7=H. |last8=Attwood |first8=C.G. |last9=Lamberth |first9=S.J. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420094105/http://www.nisc.co.za/oneAbstract?absId=3728 |archivedate=2012-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some winged [[insects]] such as [[locust]]s and certain [[butterfly|butterflies]] and [[dragonflies]] with strong flight migrate long distances. Among the dragonflies, species of ''[[Libellula]]'' and ''[[Sympetrum]]'' are known for mass migration, while ''[[Pantala flavescens]]'', known as the globe skimmer or wandering glider dragonfly, makes the longest ocean crossing of any insect, between India and Africa.&lt;ref name =Williams1957&gt;{{cite journal | author=Williams, C.B. | title=Insect Migration | journal=Annual Review of Entomology | volume=2 | pages=163–180 | year=1957 | doi=10.1146/annurev.en.02.010157.001115 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exceptionally, swarms of the desert locust, ''[[Schistocerca gregaria]]'', flew westwards across the Atlantic Ocean for 4500&amp;nbsp;km during October 1988, using air currents in the [[Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tipping, Christopher |title=Chapter 11: The Longest Migration |url=http://www.entnemdept.ufl.edu/walker/ufbir/chapters/chapter_11.shtml |publisher=Department of Entomology &amp; Nematology University of Florida |accessdate=8 September 2014 |date=8 May 1995 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924001116/http://www.entnemdept.ufl.edu/walker/ufbir/chapters/chapter_11.shtml |archivedate=24 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some [[Lepidoptera migration|migratory butterflies]], such as the [[monarch butterfly migration|monarch butterfly]] and the [[painted lady]], no individual completes the whole migration. Instead the butterflies mate and reproduce on the journey, and successive generations travel the next stage of the migration.&lt;ref&gt;Stefanescu, C., Páramo, F., Åkesson, S., Alarcón, M., Ávila, A., Brereton, T., Carnicer, J., Cassar, L.F., Fox, R., Heliölä, J., Hill, J.

==Tracking migration==
[[File:Monarch Butterfly Danaus plexippus Tagged Closeup 3008px.jpg|thumb|A migratory butterfly, a [[monarch butterfly|monarch]], tagged for identification]]
{{main|Animal migration tracking}}

Scientists gather observations of animal migration by tracking their movements. Animals were traditionally tracked with identification tags such as [[bird ringing|bird rings]] for later recovery; no information was obtained about the actual route followed between release and recovery, and only a small fraction of tagged individuals were generally recovered. More convenient, therefore, are electronic devices such as [[tracking collar|radio tracking collars]] which can be followed by radio, whether handheld, in a vehicle or aircraft, or by satellite. Tags can include a [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] receiver, enabling accurate positions to be broadcast at regular intervals, but these are inevitably heavier and more expensive than devices without GPS. An alternative is the Argos Doppler tag, also called a 'Platform Transmitter Terminal' (PTT) which sends regularly to the polar-orbiting Argos satellites; using [[Doppler shift]], the animal's location can be estimated, relatively roughly compared to GPS, but at lower cost and weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.movebank.org/node/857 | title=What is animal tracking? | publisher=Movebank (database of animal tracking data) | accessdate=19 June 2014 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421001247/https://www.movebank.org/node/857 | archivedate=21 April 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radio tracking tags can be fitted to insects including [[dragonflies]] and [[bees]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/explorers/projects/tracking-animal-migration/ | title=Tracking Migration of Dragonflies, Sparrows, and Bees | publisher=National Geographic | accessdate=19 June 2014 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140530020304/http://www.nationalgeographic.com/explorers/projects/tracking-animal-migration/ | archivedate=30 May 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In culture==
Before the [[phenomenon]] of animal migration was understood, various folklore and erroneous explanations sprang up to account for the disappearance or sudden arrival of birds in an area. In [[Ancient Greece]], [[Aristotle]] proposed that robins turned into [[Phoenicurus phoenicurus|redstarts]] when summer arrived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earthlife.net/birds/migration1.html |title=The Earthlife Web – What is Bird Migration |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090925184210/http://www.earthlife.net/birds/migration1.html |archivedate=2009-09-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[barnacle goose]] was explained in European Medieval bestiaries and manuscripts as either growing like fruit on trees, or developing from [[goose barnacle]]s on pieces of driftwood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bestiary.ca/beasts/beast1195.htm |title=Medieval Bestiary – Barnacle Goose |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161125024816/http://bestiary.ca/beasts/beast1195.htm |archivedate=2016-11-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the [[swallow]], which was once thought, even by [[naturalist]]s such as [[Gilbert White]], to [[Hibernation|hibernate]] either underwater, buried in muddy riverbanks, or in hollow trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Birds Britannica | publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus |author1=Cocker, Mark |author2=Mabey, Richard | year=2005 | page=315 | isbn=0-7011-6907-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aquacultural engineering''' is a multidisciplinary field of [[engineering]] that aims to solve technical problems associated with farming aquatic [[vertebrates]], [[invertebrates]], and [[algae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederick Wheaton|title=Aquacultural Engineering|edition= |publisher=Kreiger Pub Co|year=1933 |page= |isbn= 978-0-8946-4786-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common aquaculture systems requiring optimization and engineering include sea cages, [[ponds]], and recirculating systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Odd-Ivar Lekang|title=Aquaculture Engineering|edition= 2nd |publisher=John WIley &amp; Sons|year=2013|page=165 |isbn=978-0-470-67085-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design and management of these systems is based on their production goals and the economics of the farming operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Colt |first=John |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1990 |month= |title=The Role of Engineering Disciplines in Aquaculture|url= |journal=iChemE Symposium Series No. 111 |issn= |volume= |issue= |pages=1–17 |id=|accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aquaculture technology is varied with design and development requiring knowledge of mechanical, biological and environmental systems along with [[material engineering]] and [[instrumentation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas B. Lawson|title=Fundamentals of Aquaculture Engineering|edition= |publisher=Springer US|year=1995|page= |isbn=978-1-4615-7049-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, engineering techniques often involve solutions borrowed from [[wastewater treatment]], fisheries, and traditional agriculture.

Aquacultural engineering has played a role in the expansion of the aquaculture industry, which now accounts for half of all [[seafood products]] consumed in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-i5555e.pdf|title=2016 The State of the Worlds Fisheries and Aquaculture|last=|first=|date=2016|website=Food and Agriculture Organization|publisher=United Nations|location=Rome, Italy|page=77|isbn=978-92-5-109185-2|access-date=2016-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; To identify effective solutions the discipline is combined with both fish physiology and business economics knowledge.

==Recirculating aquaculture systems==
[[Recirculating aquaculture systems]] often involve intensive, high-density culture of a species with limited water usage and extensive filtration. In a typical recirculating aquaculture system, a series of filtration steps maintains a high level of water quality that promotes rapid fish growth.&lt;ref name="Timmons"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael B. Timmons and James B. Ebeling|title=Recirculating Aquaculture|edition= 3rd |publisher=Ithaca Publishing Company Publishers|year=2013|page=3 |isbn=978-0971264656}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steps include solids removal, biofiltration, oxygenation, and pumping, with each one requiring different equipment and engineering considerations. Comprehensive instrumentation and sensor controls are required to monitor this equipment and the underlying water conditions such as temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pH. Development of recirculating aquaculture systems is still underway in 2017, and engineering advances are needed to make the systems economically viable for culturing most species.

==Research==
The ''Journal of Aquacultural Engineering'' publishes engineers' studies related to the design and development of aquacultural systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= |month= |title=Aims &amp; Scope|url=http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/405852/description#description|trans_title= |journal=Aquacultural Engineering |issn= 0144-8609|volume= |issue= |pages= |id=|accessdate=2009-08-23 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Worldwide, universities provide aquacultural engineering education often under the umbrella of agricultural or biological engineering.

'''Biostratigraphy''' is the branch of [[stratigraphy]] which focuses on correlating and assigning relative ages of rock [[Stratum|strata]] by using the [[fossil]] assemblages contained within them. Usually the aim is correlation, demonstrating that a particular [[Horizon (geology)|horizon]] in one geological section represents the same period of time as another horizon at some other section. The fossils are useful because [[sediment]]s of the same age can look completely different because of local variations in the [[Sedimentary depositional environment|sedimentary environment]]. For example, one section might have been made up of [[clay]]s and [[marl]]s while another has more [[chalk]]y [[limestone]]s, but if the fossil species recorded are similar, the two sediments are likely to have been laid down at the same time.

Biostratigraphy originated in the early 19th century, where geologists recognised that the correlation of fossil assemblages between rocks of similar type but different age decreased as the difference in age increased.  The method was well-established before [[Charles Darwin]] explained the mechanism behind it—[[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Gluyas, J. &amp; Swarbrick, R. (2004) Petroleum Geoscience. Publ. Blackwell Publishing. pp. 80-82&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Archeocyathids.JPG|thumb|The first reef builder is a worldwide index fossil for the Lower Cambrian]]
[[Ammonite]]s, [[graptolite]]s, [[archeocyathid]]s, and [[trilobite]]s are [[index fossil]]s that are widely used in biostratigraphy. [[micropaleontology|Microfossils]] such as [[acritarchs]], [[chitinozoa]]ns, [[conodont]]s, [[dinoflagellate]] cysts,  [[ostracods]], [[pollen]], [[spores]] and [[foraminifera]]ns are also frequently used. Different fossils work well for sediments of different ages; trilobites, for example, are particularly useful for sediments of [[Cambrian]] age. To work well, the fossils used must be widespread geographically, so that they can occur in many different places. They must also be short lived as a species, so that the period of time during which they could be incorporated in the sediment is relatively narrow. The longer lived the species, the poorer the stratigraphic precision, so fossils that evolve rapidly, such as ammonites, are favoured over forms that evolve much more slowly, like [[nautiloid]]s.  Often biostratigraphic correlations are based on a fauna, not an individual species, as this allows greater precision. Further, if only one species is present in a sample, it can mean that (1) the strata were formed in the known fossil range of that organism; (2) that the fossil range of the organism was incompletely known, and the strata extend the known fossil range.  For instance, the presence of the trace fossil ''[[Treptichnus pedum]]'' was used to define the base of the Cambrian period, but it has since been found in older strata.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Fossil assemblages were traditionally used to designate the duration of periods. Since a large change in fauna was required to make early stratigraphers create a new period, most of the periods we recognise today are terminated by a major extinction event or faunal turnover.

== Fossils as a basis for stratigraphic subdivision ==

===Concept of stage===
{{further|Faunal stage}}
A stage is a major subdivision of strata, each systematically following the other each bearing a unique assemblage of fossils. Therefore, stages can be defined as a group of strata containing the same major fossil assemblages. French [[palaeontologist]] [[Alcide d'Orbigny]] is credited for the invention of this concept. He named stages after geographic localities with particularly good sections of rock strata that bear the characteristic fossils on which the stages are based.

===Concept of zone===
{{further|Chronozone}}
In 1856 German palaeontologist [[Albert Oppel]] introduced the concept of zone (also known as biozones or Oppel zone). A zone includes strata characterised by the overlapping range of fossils. They represent the time between the appearance of species chosen at the base of the zone and the appearance of other species chosen at the base of the next succeeding zone. Oppel's zones are named after a particular distinctive fossil species, called an index fossil. Index fossils are one of the species from the assemblage of species that characterise the zone. 

The zone is the fundamental biostratigraphic unit. Its thickness range from a few to hundreds of metres, and its extant range from local to worldwide. Biostratigraphic units are divided into six principal kinds of biozones:
*''Taxon range biozone'' represent the known stratigraphic and geographic range of occurrence of a single taxon.
*''Concurrent range biozone'' include the concurrent, coincident, or overlapping part of the range of two specified taxa.
*''Interval biozone'' include the strata between two specific biostratigraphic surfaces. It can be based on lowest or highest occurrences.
*''Lineage biozone'' are strata containing species representing a specific segment of an evolutionary lineage.
*''Assemblage biozones'' are strata that contain a unique association of three or more taxa.
*''Abundance biozone'' are strata in which the abundance of a particular taxon or group of taxa is significantly greater than in the adjacent part of the section.

====Index fossils====
[[Image:DiplograptusCaneySprings.jpg|thumb|''Amplexograptus'', a [[graptolite]] index fossil, from the [[Ordovician]] near Caney Springs, [[Tennessee]].]]
To be useful in stratigraphic correlation index fossils should be:
*Independent of their environment
*Geographically widespread (provincialism/isolation of species should be avoided as much as possible)
*Rapidly evolving

*Easy to preserve (Easier in low-energy, non-oxidized environment)
*Easy to identify
====Faunal succession====
Fossil organisms succeed one           
another in a definite and determinable order and  
therefore any time period can be recognized by its 
fossil content.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14023">In [[formal language theory]], a  '''context-free language''' ('''CFL''') is a [[formal language|language]] generated by a [[context-free grammar]] (CFG).

Context-free languages have many applications in [[programming languages]], in particular, most arithmetic expressions are generated by context-free grammars.

==Background==

===Context-free grammar===

Different context-free grammars can generate the same context-free language. Intrinsic properties of the language can be distinguished from extrinsic properties of a particular grammar by comparing multiple grammars that describe the language.

===Automata===

The set of all context-free languages is identical to the set of languages accepted by [[pushdown automata]], which makes these languages amenable to parsing. Further, for a given CFG, there is a direct way to produce a pushdown automaton for the grammar (and thereby the corresponding language), though going the other way (producing a grammar given an automaton) is not as direct.

==Examples==

A model context-free language is &lt;math&gt;L = \{a^nb^n:n\geq1\}&lt;/math&gt;, the language of all non-empty even-length strings, the entire first halves of which are {{mvar|a}}'s, and the entire second halves of which are {{mvar|b}}'s. {{mvar|L}} is generated by the grammar &lt;math&gt;S\to aSb ~|~ ab&lt;/math&gt;.
This language is not [[regular language|regular]].
It is accepted by the [[pushdown automaton#Formal definition|pushdown automaton]] &lt;math&gt;M=(\{q_0,q_1,q_f\}, \{a,b\}, \{a,z\}, \delta, q_0, z, \{q_f\})&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is defined as follows:&lt;ref group=note&gt;meaning of &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;'s arguments and results: &lt;math&gt;\delta(\mathrm{state}_1, \mathrm{read}, \mathrm{pop}) = (\mathrm{state}_2, \mathrm{push})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\delta(q_0, a, z) &amp;= (q_0, az) \\
\delta(q_0, a, a) &amp;= (q_0, aa) \\
\delta(q_0, b, a) &amp;= (q_1, \varepsilon) \\
\delta(q_1, b, a) &amp;= (q_1, \varepsilon) \\
\delta(q_1, \varepsilon, z) &amp;= (q_f, \varepsilon)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Unambiguous CFLs are a proper subset of all CFLs: there are [[Inherently ambiguous language|inherently ambiguous]] CFLs. An example of an inherently ambiguous CFL is the union of &lt;math&gt;\{a^n b^m c^m d^n | n, m &gt; 0\}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\{a^n b^n c^m d^m | n, m &gt; 0\}&lt;/math&gt;. This set is context-free, since the union of two context-free languages is always context-free. But there is no way to unambiguously parse strings in the (non-context-free) subset &lt;math&gt;\{a^n b^n c^n d^n | n &gt; 0\}&lt;/math&gt; which is the intersection of these two languages.{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=100|loc=Theorem 4.7}}

===Dyck language===

The [[Dyck language|language of all properly matched parentheses]] is generated by the grammar &lt;math&gt;S\to SS ~|~ (S) ~|~ \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;.

==Properties==

===Context-free parsing===
{{main|Parsing}}

The context-free nature of the language makes it simple to parse with a pushdown automaton.

Determining an instance of the [[membership problem]]; i.e. given a string &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;, determine whether &lt;math&gt;w \in L(G)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the language generated by a given grammar &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;; is also known as ''recognition''. Context-free recognition for [[Chomsky normal form]] grammars was shown by Leslie G. Valiant to be reducible to boolean [[matrix multiplication]], thus inheriting its complexity upper bound of [[Big O notation|''O'']](''n''&lt;sup&gt;2.3728639&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport| author=Leslie Valiant| title=General context-free recognition in less than cubic time|date=Jan 1974| pages=11| institution=Carnegie Mellon University| url=http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2751&amp;context=compsci}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Leslie G. Valiant| title=General context-free recognition in less than cubic time| journal=Journal of Computer and System Sciences| year=1975| volume=10| number=2| pages=308–315| doi=10.1016/s0022-0000(75)80046-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;In Valiant's papers, ''O''(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2.81&lt;/sup&gt;) given, the then best known upper bound. See [[Matrix multiplication#Algorithms for efficient matrix multiplication]] and [[Coppersmith–Winograd algorithm]] for bound improvements since then.&lt;/ref&gt;
Conversely, Lillian Lee has shown ''O''(''n''&lt;sup&gt;3−ε&lt;/sup&gt;) boolean matrix multiplication to be reducible to ''O''(''n''&lt;sup&gt;3−3ε&lt;/sup&gt;) CFG parsing, thus establishing some kind of lower bound for the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Lillian Lee| title=Fast Context-Free Grammar Parsing Requires Fast Boolean Matrix Multiplication| journal=J ACM| year=2002| volume=49| number=1| pages=1–15| url=http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/llee/papers/bmmcfl-jacm.pdf| doi=10.1145/505241.505242| arxiv=cs/0112018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Practical uses of context-free languages require also to produce a derivation tree that exhibits the  structure that the grammar associates with the given string. The process of producing this tree is called ''[[parsing]]''. Known parsers have a time complexity that is cubic in the size of the string that is parsed.

Formally, the set of all context-free languages is identical to the set of languages accepted by pushdown automata (PDA). Parser algorithms for context-free languages include the [[CYK algorithm]] and [[Earley parser|Earley's Algorithm]].

A special subclass of context-free languages are the [[deterministic context-free language]]s which are defined as the set of languages accepted by a [[deterministic pushdown automaton]] and can be parsed by a [[LR parser|LR(k) parser]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Knuth | first1 = D.

See also [[parsing expression grammar]] as an alternative approach to grammar and parser.

===Closure===
Context-free languages are [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under the following operations. That is, if ''L'' and ''P'' are context-free languages, the following languages are context-free as well:
*the [[union (set theory)|union]] &lt;math&gt;L \cup P&lt;/math&gt; of ''L'' and ''P''{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=131|loc=Corollary of Theorem 6.1}}
*the reversal of ''L''{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=142|loc=Exercise 6.4d}}
*the [[concatenation]] &lt;math&gt;L \cdot P&lt;/math&gt; of ''L'' and ''P''{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=131|loc=Corollary of Theorem 6.1}}
*the [[Kleene star]] &lt;math&gt;L^*&lt;/math&gt; of ''L''{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=131|loc=Corollary of Theorem 6.1}}
*the image &lt;math&gt;\varphi(L)&lt;/math&gt; of ''L'' under a [[String operations#String homomorphism|homomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=131-132|loc=Corollary of Theorem 6.2}}
*the image &lt;math&gt;\varphi^{-1}(L)&lt;/math&gt; of ''L'' under an [[String operations#String homomorphism|inverse homomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;\varphi^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=132|loc=Theorem 6.3}}
*the [[circular shift#Applications|circular shift]] of ''L'' (the language &lt;math&gt;\{vu : uv \in L \}&lt;/math&gt;){{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=142-144|loc=Exercise 6.4c}}
*the prefix closure of ''L'' (the set of all [[Prefix (computer science)|prefix]]es of strings from ''L''){{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=142|loc=Exercise 6.4b}}
*the [[Quotient of a formal language|quotient]] ''L''/''R'' of ''L'' by a regular language ''R''{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=142|loc=Exercise 6.4a}}

====Nonclosure under intersection, complement, and difference====
The context-free languages are not closed under intersection.  This can be seen by taking the languages &lt;math&gt;A = \{a^n b^n c^m \mid m, n \geq 0 \}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B = \{a^m b^n c^n \mid m,n \geq 0\}&lt;/math&gt;, which are both context-free.&lt;ref group=note&gt;A context-free grammar for the language ''A'' is given by the following production rules, taking ''S'' as the start symbol: ''S'' → ''Sc'' | ''aTb'' | ''ε''; ''T'' → ''aTb'' | ''ε''. The grammar for ''B'' is analogous.&lt;/ref&gt; Their intersection is &lt;math&gt;A \cap B = \{ a^n b^n c^n \mid n \geq 0\}&lt;/math&gt;, which can be shown to be non-context-free by the [[pumping lemma for context-free languages]]. As a consequence, context-free languages cannot be closed under complementation, as for any languages ''A'' and ''B'', their intersection can be expressed by union and complement:  &lt;math&gt;A \cap B = \overline{\overline{A} \cup \overline{B}} &lt;/math&gt;. In particular, context-free language cannot be closed under difference, since complement can be expressed by difference: &lt;math&gt;\overline{L} = \Sigma^* \setminus L&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Scheinberg.1960"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82210847.pdf | author=Stephen Scheinberg | title=Note on the Boolean Properties of Context Free Languages | journal=Information and Control | volume=3 | number= | pages=372&amp;ndash;375 | month= | year=1960 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, if ''L'' is a context-free language and ''D'' is a regular language then both their intersection &lt;math&gt;L\cap D&lt;/math&gt; and their difference &lt;math&gt;L\setminus D&lt;/math&gt; are context-free languages.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

===Decidability===
In formal language theory, questions about regular languages are usually decidable, but ones about context-free languages are often not. It is decidable whether such a language is finite, but not whether it contains every possible string, is regular, is unambiguous, or is equivalent to a language with a different grammar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=1138|isbn=1-57955-008-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following problems are [[Undecidable problem|undecidable]] for arbitrarily given [[context-free grammar]]s A and B:
*Equivalence: is &lt;math&gt;L(A)=L(B)&lt;/math&gt;?{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=203|loc=Theorem 8.12(1)}}
*Disjointness: is &lt;math&gt;L(A) \cap L(B) = \emptyset &lt;/math&gt; ?{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=202|loc=Theorem 8.10}} However, the intersection of a context-free language and a ''regular'' language is context-free,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Salomaa|1973}}, p. 59, Theorem 6.7&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=135|loc=Theorem 6.5}} hence the variant of the problem where ''B'' is a regular grammar is decidable (see "Emptiness" below).
*Containment: is &lt;math&gt;L(A) \subseteq L(B)&lt;/math&gt; ?{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=203|loc=Theorem 8.12(2)}} Again, the variant of the problem where ''B'' is a regular grammar is decidable,{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} while that where ''A'' is regular is generally not.{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=203|loc=Theorem 8.12(4)}}
*Universality: is &lt;math&gt;L(A)=\Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; ?{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=203|loc=Theorem 8.11}}

The following problems are ''decidable'' for arbitrary context-free languages:
*Emptiness: Given a context-free grammar ''A'', is &lt;math&gt;L(A) = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt; ?{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=137|loc=Theorem 6.6(a)}}
*Finiteness: Given a context-free grammar ''A'', is &lt;math&gt;L(A)&lt;/math&gt; finite?{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=137|loc=Theorem 6.6(b)}}
*Membership: Given a context-free grammar ''G'', and  a word &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;, does &lt;math&gt;w \in L(G)&lt;/math&gt; ? Efficient polynomial-time algorithms for the membership problem are the [[CYK algorithm]] and [[Earley parser|Earley's Algorithm]].

According to Hopcroft, Motwani, Ullman (2003),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John E. Hopcroft |author2=Rajeev Motwani |author3=Jeffrey D. Ullman | title=Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation| year=2003| publisher=Addison Wesley}} Here: Sect.7.6, p.304, and Sect.9.7, p.411&lt;/ref&gt; 
many of the fundamental closure and (un)decidability properties of context-free languages were shown in the 1961 paper of Bar-Hillel, Perles, and Shamir&lt;ref name="Bar-Hillel.Perles.Shamir.1961"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Yehoshua Bar-Hillel |author2=Micha Asher Perles |author3=Eli Shamir | title=On Formal Properties of Simple Phrase-Structure Grammars| journal=Zeitschrift für Phonetik, Sprachwissenschaft und Kommunikationsforschung| year=1961| volume=14| number=2| pages=143–172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Languages that are not context-free===

The set &lt;math&gt;\{a^n b^n c^n d^n | n &gt; 0\}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[context-sensitive language]], but there does not exist a context-free grammar generating this language.{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979}} So there exist context-sensitive languages which are not context-free. To prove that a given language is not context-free, one may employ the [[pumping lemma for context-free languages]]&lt;ref name="Bar-Hillel.Perles.Shamir.1961"/&gt; or a number of other methods, such as [[Ogden's lemma]] or [[Parikh's theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/265/how-to-prove-that-a-language-is-not-context-free How to prove that a language is not context-free?]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fungi in Borneo.jpg|thumb|300px|The fungi on this tree are decomposers.]]
'''Decomposers''' are organisms that break down dead or decaying organisms, and in doing so, they carry out the natural process of [[decomposition]].&lt;ref name=ACE&gt;[http://nerrs.noaa.gov/doc/siteprofile/acebasin/html/biores/decomp/dctext.htm  NOAA. ACE Basin National Estuarine Research Reserve: Decomposers.]&lt;/ref&gt; Like [[herbivore]]s and [[predator]]s, decomposers are [[heterotrophic]], meaning that they use [[organic material|organic substrates]] to get their [[energy]], [[carbon]] and [[nutrients]] for growth and development. While the terms decomposer and [[detritivore]] are often interchangeably used, detritivores must ingest and digest dead matter via internal processes while decomposers can directly absorb nutrients through chemical and biological processes hence breaking down matter without ingesting it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eoearth.org/article/Trophic_level?topic=58074 ''Trophic level''. Eds. M.McGinley &amp; C.J.cleveland. Encyclopedia of Earth. National Council for Science and the Environment. Washington DC]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, invertebrates such as [[earthworm]]s, [[woodlice]], and [[sea cucumbers]] are technically detritivores, not decomposers, since they must ingest nutrients and are unable to absorb them externally.

== Fungi ==
The primary  decomposer of litter in  many [[ecosystems]] are [[fungi]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} Unlike [[bacteria]], which are unicellular organisms, most [[saprotroph]]ic fungi grow as a branching network of [[hypha]]e. While bacteria are restricted to growing and feeding on the exposed surfaces of organic matter, fungi can use their hyphae to penetrate larger pieces of organic matter. Additionally, only [[wood-decay fungus|wood-decay fungi]] have evolved the [[enzyme]]s necessary to decompose [[lignin]], a chemically complex substance found in wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blanchette|first1=Robert|title=Delignification by Wood-Decay Fungi|journal=Annual Review of Phytopathology|date=September 1991|volume=29|pages=281–403|doi=10.1146/annurev.py.29.090191.002121|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.py.29.090191.002121?journalCode=phyto|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two factors make fungi the primary decomposers in [[forest]]s, where litter has high concentrations of lignin and often occurs in [[coarse woody debris|large pieces]]. Fungi decompose organic matter by releasing enzymes to break down the decaying material, after which they absorb the nutrients in the decaying material.&lt;ref name=berkeley&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/fungi/fungilh.html |title=Fungi: Life History and Ecology |first1=Ben |last1=Waggoner |first2=Brian |last2=Speer |work=Introduction to the Funge=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hyphae used to break down matter and absorb nutrients are also used in reproduction.  When two compatible fungii hyphae grow close to each other, they will then fuse together for reproduction and form another fungus.&lt;ref name=berkeley /&gt;

[[File:PAX6 Phenotypes Washington etal PLoSBiol e1000247.png|right|400px|thumb|''[[pax6]]'' alterations result in similar phenotypic alterations of eye morphology and function across a wide range of species.]]

In [[evolutionary developmental biology]],  the concept of '''deep homology''' is used to describe cases where [[Cell growth|growth]] and [[Cellular differentiation|differentiation]] processes are governed by genetic mechanisms that are [[Homology (biology)#Homology of sequences in genetics|homologous]] and deeply [[Conserved sequence|conserved]] across a wide range of [[species]].

==History==
{{further|Evolutionary developmental biology}}

In 1822, the French zoologist [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] dissected a [[crayfish]], discovering that its body is organised like a vertebrate's, but [[Inversion (evolutionary biology)|inverted belly to back (dorsoventrally)]]:&lt;ref name=Held2&gt;{{cite book |last1=Held |first1=Lewis I. |authorlink=Lewis Held |title=Deep Homology?: Uncanny Similarities of Humans and Flies Uncovered by Evo-Devo |date=February 2017 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1316601211 |pages=2–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I just found that all the soft organs, that is to say, the principal organs of life are found in crustaceans, and so in insects, in the same order, in the same relationships and with the same arrangement as their analogues in the high vertebrate animals ... What was my surprise, and I may add, my admiration, seeing [such] a rule ...&lt;ref name=Held2/&gt;}}

[[File:Genes hox.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Homology (biology)|Homologous]] [[hox gene|''hox'' genes]] in such different animals as [[insect]]s and [[vertebrate]]s control [[embryogenesis|embryonic development]] and hence the [[Morphology (biology)|form]] of adult bodies. These genes have been [[conserved sequence|highly conserved]] through hundreds of millions of years of [[evolution]].]]

Geoffroy's homology theory was denounced by the leading French zoologist of his day, [[Georges Cuvier]], but in 1994, Geoffroy was shown to be correct.&lt;ref name=Held2/&gt; In 1915, [[Santiago Ramon y Cajal]] mapped the neural connections of the optic lobes of a fly, finding that these resembled those of vertebrates.&lt;ref name=Held2/&gt; In 1978, [[Edward B. Lewis]] helped to found [[evolutionary developmental biology]], discovering that [[homeosis|homeotic genes]] regulated embryonic development in fruit flies.&lt;ref name=Held2/&gt;

In 1997, the term deep homology first appeared in a paper by [[Neil Shubin]], Cliff Tabin, and [[Sean B. Carroll]], describing the apparent relatedness in genetic regulatory apparatuses which indicated evolutionary similarities in disparate animal features.&lt;ref name="Shubin Tabin Carroll 1997"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Shubin | first=Neil | last2=Tabin | first2=Cliff | last3=Carroll | first3=Sean | title=Fossils, genes and the evolution of animal limbs | journal=Nature | publisher=Springer Nature | volume=388 | issue=6643 | year=1997 | doi=10.1038/41710 | pages=639–648 | url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e9fd/04bdfae57145375564321602c405bb0cbaa4.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==A different kind of homology==

Whereas ordinary [[homology (biology)|homology]] is seen in the pattern of structures such as limb bones of mammals that are evidently related, deep homology can apply to groups of animals that have quite dissimilar anatomy: vertebrates (with [[endoskeleton]]s made of [[bone]] and [[cartilage]]) and arthropods (with [[exoskeleton]]s made of [[chitin]]) nevertheless have limbs that are constructed using similar recipes or "algorithms".&lt;ref name="Shubin Tabin Carroll 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Carroll66&gt;{{cite book |last=Carroll |first=Sean B. |authorlink=Sean B. Carroll |title=Endless Forms Most Beautiful |titlelink=Endless Forms Most Beautiful (book) |date=2006 |publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson |isbn=0-297-85094-6 |pages=28, 66–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Homologous Pathways of Development |chapterurl=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br.fcgi?book=dbio&amp;part=A5439 |author=Gilbert, Scott F. |authorlink=Scott F.

Within the [[metazoa]], [[homeotic gene]]s control differentiation along major [[body axis|body axes]], and [[pax genes]] (especially [[PAX6]]) help to control the development of the [[eye]] and other [[sensory organ]]s. The deep homology applies across widely separated groups, such as in the eyes of [[mammals]] and the structurally quite different [[compound eye]]s of [[insects]].&lt;ref name=Carroll66/&gt;

Similarly, [[hox gene]]s help to form an animal's segmentation pattern. HoxA and HoxD, that regulate finger and toe formation in mice, control the development of [[Actinopterygii|ray fins]] in [[zebrafish]]; these structures had until then been considered non-homologous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/18/science/from-fins-into-hands-scientists-discover-a-deep-evolutionary-link.html |title=From Fins Into Hands: Scientists Discover a Deep Evolutionary Link |last=Zimmer |first=Carl |authorlink=Carl Zimmer|date=2016-08-17 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a possible deep homology among animals that use acoustic communication, such as songbirds and humans, which may share unmutated versions of the [[FOXP2]] gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |title=Evo-Devo, Deep Homology and FoxP2: Implications for the Evolution of Speech and Language |author1=Scharff, Petri |author2=Constance, Jane |journal=Philos.

==Algorithm==

In 2010, a team led by [[Edward Marcotte]] developed an [[algorithm]] that identifies deeply homologous genetic modules in unicellular organisms, plants, and animals based on [[phenotype]]s (such as traits and developmental defects). The technique aligns phenotypes across organisms based on [[Homology (biology)#Orthology|orthology]] (a type of homology) of genes involved in the phenotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Zimmer, Carl |authorlink=Carl Zimmer |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/27/science/27gene.html?hp=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=The Search for Genes Leads to Unexpected Places |work=The New York Times |date=April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McGary2010"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=McGary, K.

==Incident==

In early June 2005, the woman, who appears to be in her 20s, took her [[lap dog]] on [[Seoul Subway Line 2]]. Her dog [[defecation|defecated]] on the floor of the subway car and, when other riders requested that she clean up after it, she declined to do so. Another subway rider offered the woman a tissue, which she used to clean the dog but not its waste. Other passengers suggested she clean up the mess, she ignored the second group of requests and departed the subway at the next stop. Another female commuter, using a [[camera phone]], took several photographs of the woman and dog, and posted them on a popular Korean website.&lt;ref name="Netizens Need"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Puppy poo girl"/&gt;

== Reaction  ==
Soon after the unaltered photos were published, Internet vigilante groups closely examined the picture and within days she had been identified and her [[personally identifiable information|personal information]] released on the Internet. The photo quickly became one of the most popular image searches on popular Korean [[web portal]]s and a source of [[parody]] and derisive [[satire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The woman quit her university in [[shame]] and published a photo of her dog with a [[public apology]].&lt;ref name="Internet's Best Friend"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://boom.naver.com/1/20050619170920827 The woman's apology], in Korean, with a picture of the dog&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dkbnews.com/bbs/zboard.php?id=pogpungnews&amp;no=418 Article about 'The woman's apology'], in Korean&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
The reaction by Korean Internet users to the incident prompted several Korean newspapers to run editorials voicing concern over [[Internet vigilantism]], suggesting that the effect of world-wide crowds do not result in wise, uniform judgments and appropriate punishments via [[social stigma]]. The implications for personal [[privacy]] were raised.  Some said that posting the woman's picture was acceptable, but that posting her personal information was inappropriate.  Others said that her face should have been obscured in the widely circulated picture, in order to protect her identity.&lt;ref name="trial by internet"/&gt;

According to [[Daniel J. Solove]], a professor who specializes in privacy issues at [[George Washington University Law School]], the case:

{{cquote|...involves a [[social norm|norm]] that most people would seemingly agree to -- clean up after your dog...But having a permanent record of one's norm violations is upping the sanction to a whole new level . . . allowing bloggers to act as a cyber-[[wikt:posse#Noun|posse]], tracking down norm violators and branding them with digital [[scarlet letter]]s.&lt;ref name="krim"/&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30723">'''Education sector responses to LGBT violence''' addresses the ways in which education systems work to create safe learning environments for [[LGBT]] students. Overall, education sector responses tend to focus on [[homophobia]] and [[Violence against LGBT people|violence linked to sexual orientation and gender identity/expression]], and less on [[transphobia]]. Most responses focus in some way on diverse expressions of gender and support students to understand that gender may be expressed in a different way from [[Gender role|binary models]] (of masculine and feminine). Responses vary greatly in their scope (from a single class to the national level); duration (from one-off events to several years); and level of support that they enjoy (from individual teachers to the highest levels of government).&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002447/244756e.pdf|title=Out in the Open: Education sector responses to violence based on sexual orientation and gender identity/expression|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2016|isbn=978-92-3-100150-5|location=|pages=15, 61–62, 65, 69–75, 82–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A comprehensive [[Education#Education sector|education sector]] response to homophobic and transphobic violence encompasses all of the following elements: effective policies, relevant curricula and learning materials, training and support for staff, support for students and families information and strategic partnerships, and monitoring and evaluation.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Very few countries have education sector policies that address homophobic and transphobic violence or include [[sexual orientation]] and [[gender identity]]/expression in [[Curriculum|curricula]] or learning materials. In most countries, staff lack training and support to address sexual orientation and gender identity/expression and to prevent and respond to homophobic and transphobic violence. Although many countries provide support for students who experience violence, services are often ill-equipped to deal with homophobic and transphobic violence. Few countries collect data on the nature, prevalence or impact of homophobic and transphobic violence, which contributes to low awareness of the problem and lack of evidence for planning effective responses.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In general terms, the range of responses to homophobic and transphobic violence in educational settings appears to correlate to a country's: socio-cultural context (in terms of the society's beliefs and attitudes towards sexual and [[gender diversity]], as well as to [[human rights]] and [[gender equality]]); and legal context (in terms of the rights of LGBTI individuals and the situation of human rights in general).&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; 

== Policy approaches ==
Few countries have developed education sector policies to prevent and address homophobic and transphobic violence in schools, reflecting the fact that recognition of the prevalence and harmful impact of such violence in the sector is a relatively recent development. Most countries that have developed policies have taken one of the two following approaches:
* Integrating references to sexual orientation and gender identity or to homophobic and transphobic discrimination and violence into existing education sector policies on general violence, [[bullying]] or discrimination.
* Developing specific education sector policies that focus on violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity/expression.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;
The first approach aims to protect and support LGBTI students by mainstreaming issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity into broader policies to prevent and address discrimination and violence. However, available data suggest that in countries where policies do not clearly refer to homophobic and transphobic violence, this form of violence may not be addressed by schools. For example, a large-scale qualitative research study conducted in 19 European countries in 2013 by the European Union [[Fundamental Rights Agency]] concluded that: 'Where anti-bullying measures are in place, these are often generic and they may be ineffective in dealing specifically with bullying on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;FRA, Professionally speaking: challenges to achieving equality for LGBT people. Vienna - Austria: European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
The second approach requires political leadership and a legal environment that is conducive to the protection of the rights of LGBTI people. A number of countries have developed specific education sector policies that address homophobic and transphobic violence in schools and other educational settings.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Work conducted in countering violence in schools in general has shown that 'school and system wide interventions', often referred to as 'whole school' strategies or approaches, are particularly effective. The same applies to education sector responses to homophobic and transphobic violence. In this report, 'whole school' responses to homophobic and transphobic violence are also referred to as 'comprehensive' education sector responses, which can also be referred to as 'holistic', 'systematic', 'systemic', 'system-wide'.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== National policies ==
Progress in implementing measures to prevent and address homophobic and transphobic violence in educational settings varies between regions and countries. The most comprehensive initiatives are being implemented in Australia and New Zealand, Canada and the United States, and a number of countries in Europe, Asia and Latin America. However, the education sector response has been limited in the majority of countries in the world, particularly in Africa, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Central Asia and some areas of the Pacific. In addition, it is important to note that many countries do not have comprehensive strategies to prevent and address violence in schools in general.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

National legislation against discrimination (as a whole) has served as a basis to develop national policies – which either include, or are specific to, the education sector – that address discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity/expression. In general, the education sector tends to address homophobic and transphobic violence through wider policies on violence, such as those related to bullying in schools or safe schools.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Asia ===
In Asia, the Philippines is the only country to include specific references to violence on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity/expression in a national law (2013).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;UNESCO, 'From Insult to Inclusion: Asia-Pacific report on school bullying, violence and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity', UNESCO, Paris and Bangkok, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan, in 2015, the Ministry of Education issued landmark guidance urging local education boards to ensure that schools cater to the needs of LGBT students.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At a more local level, the 2004 [[Gender Equity Education Act (Taiwan)|Gender Equity Education Act]] in Taiwan of China seeks to eliminate gender stereotypes from the curriculum and prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in schools.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, a regional report developed for this review notes that implementation measures for this Act may be inadequate to effectively prevent and address discrimination.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

All other countries in the Asia region, apart from Pakistan, have legal or policy frameworks to address violence in educational institutions or the health of minors, although they vary in their nature and jurisdiction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In India, following a 2014 ruling by the Supreme Court recognizing the status of [[Hijra (South Asia)|Hijras]], the University Grants Commission called on all universities to recognize transgender students and to include a transgender category on all application forms, academic testimonials and official documents.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO, 'Asia-Pacific Consultation on School Bullying based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity / Expression - Meeting Report', UNESCO, Bangkok, Thailand, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== North America ===
In North America, in 2002, the Supreme Court in Canada ruled that LGBT students and same-sex parents had the right to be safe from discrimination and to see their lives reflected in the school curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Supreme Court Judgements, 'Chamberlain v. Surrey School District No. 36, [2002] 4 S.C.R. 710, 2002 SCC 86', 2012. [Online]. Available: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/&lt;/nowiki&gt; scc-csc/en/item/2030/index.do.

Stud., vol. 3, no. 2, pp. 131–145, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, it ruled that school districts were 'liable for the discriminatory conduct of the students who harassed' and that they had a duty to provide students with 'an educational environment that does not expose them to discriminatory harassment'.&lt;ref&gt;Court of Appeal for British Columbia, 'School District No. 44 (North Vancouver) v. Jubran, 2005 BCCA 201 (CanLII)', 2005. [Online]. Available: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcca/&lt;/nowiki&gt; doc/2005/2005bcca201/2005bcca201.html. [Accessed: 10-Aug-2015].&lt;/ref&gt; The Ontario Education Act of Canada was amended in 2012 to specifically integrate attention to homophobic bullying following several years of amendments to Safe School legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Legislative Assembly of Ontario, 'Bill 13, Accepting Schools Act', 2012. [Online]. Available: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://ontla.on.ca/web/bills/bills_detail.do?locale=en&amp;BillID=2549&lt;/nowiki&gt;. [Accessed: 23-Sep- 2015].&lt;/ref&gt; The Act strengthened legal obligations for school boards to foster positive school environments and to prevent and address inappropriate student behaviour, including homophobic or transphobic violence. For example, principals must suspend students and consider expulsion for misbehaviour that is motivated by bias, prejudice or hatred, including that which is based on gender, sexual orientation or gender identity/expression. School boards must provide support for victims of bullying, witnesses and perpetrators. In Quebec, legislation was adopted in 2012 for schools to provide healthy and safe learning environments, allowing every student to develop their full potential regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity/expression.&lt;ref&gt;Assemblée nationale du Québec, 'Bill 56: An Act to Prevent and Stop Bullying and Violence in Schools', 2015.

In the United States, LGBT students are not protected under federal legislation. However, in 2010, the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]] issued guidance to specify that federal provisions outlawing discrimination on the basis of sex in education (Title IX) also offered some protection against bullying on the basis of sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Education, 'Dear Colleague Letter', 2010. [Online]. Available: http:// www2.ed.gov/about/of ces/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201010.html. [Accessed: 12-Jul- 2015].&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, it extended this protection on the grounds of gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Education, 'Questions and Answers on Title IX and Sexual Violence', 2014. [Online]. Available: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www2.ed.gov/about/of&lt;/nowiki&gt; ces/list/ocr/docs/qa-201404-title- ix.pdf. [Accessed: 12-Oct-2015].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] also clarified that transgender students must be allowed to use restrooms that correspond to their gender identity and that failure to do so amounts to sex discrimination under Title IX.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; In May 2016, the Department of Education released Examples of Policies and Emerging Practices for Supporting Transgender Students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/oese/oshs/emergingpractices.pdf|title=Examples of Policies and Emerging Practices for Supporting Transgender Students|last=U.S. Department of Education|first=|date=May 2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The document has a list of questions and answers for schools and educators concerning Student transitions, Privacy, Confidentiality, and Student Records, Sex-Segregated Activities and Facilities, Additional Practices to Support Transgender Students, Terminology, Cited Policies on Transgender Students, and Select Federal Resources on Transgender Students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/oese/oshs/emergingpractices.pdf|title=Examples of Policies and Emerging Practices for Supporting Transgender Students|last=U.S. Department of Education|first=|date=May 2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 22, 2017, the U.S. Department of Education withdrew statements of support and guidance previously issued in the Letter to Emily Prince from James A. Ferg-Cadima, Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for Policy, Office for Civil Rights at the Department of Education dated January 7, 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201702-title-ix.docx|title=Dear Colleague Letter to Emily Prince from James A.

=== Latin America ===
In Latin America and the Caribbean, Argentina is the only country that offers a full normative framework to tackle sexual orientation and gender identity/expression issues in educational contexts through the National Law on Integral Sexuality Education (2006) (26.150), the National Law on Education (2006) (26.206), the National Law for the Promotion of Coexistence and Tackling Social Conflict in Educational Institutions (2013) (26.892) and a federal guide for educational responses for addressing challenging situations linked to school life. The guide also contains a specific section on discrimination and harassment due to sexual orientation or gender identity/expression.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In 2015, the [[Constitutional Court of Colombia]] and the [[Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation|Supreme Court of Mexico]] found that bullying undermined victims' dignity, integrity and education&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO Santiago, 'La violencia homofóbica y transfóbica en el ámbito escolar: hacia centros educativos inclusivos y seguros en América Latina', UNESCO, Santiago, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and that the education sector had a direct duty to protect students from violence based on their personal characteristics.

In Uruguay, the General Law on Education (2014) includes a general reference to non-discrimination due to sexual orientation. In El Salvador, the General Law on Youth, while not referring to sexual orientation and gender identity/expression, recognizes and guarantees the right to integral comprehensive sexuality education (2013). Also the General Law on Education's article 5-A condemns inequalities and discriminatory practices between or towards students when based on traditional gendered roles (1990).&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Other countries have instruments to prevent and counter discrimination or violence, including bullying. Examples include the following:

In Chile, Law 20.609 (2012) and the Law on Education (2009) are in place to counter discrimination in general and can also be applied to a school setting. However, as none of the laws are LGBT-specific, addressing homophobic and transphobic violence is left at the discretion of individual schools.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In Colombia, no specific policy exists to tackle homophobic and transphobic violence. Law 1620 (from 2013) and the Regulatory Decree (1965) establish minimal norms for applying the Integral Roadmap for Educational Community Living and its protocols, in order to prevent and mitigate situations affecting school community living and the exercising of human, sexual and reproductive rights.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In Honduras, the Law Against Bullying was adopted in 2014. However, it does not refer to particular motives for bullying.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In Peru, the General Law on Education (2003) establishes that integral sexuality education is part of the right to education. A Law promoting violence-free community living in educational institutions (29719) exists (2011), although it does not refer to homophobic or transphobic violence.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Cuba, El Salvador and Peru guarantee the right to comprehensive sexuality education, which should cover issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity/expression.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

As with other regions of the world, although these rights-based policies are on the statute books in countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, a regional survey of 19 states – conducted by the Inter-American Institute for Human Rights in 2011 – noted that, in the majority of cases, they are not rigorously implemented and are 'always very general, dispersed, and in some cases ambiguous'.&lt;ref&gt;IIDH, 'Informe Interamericano de la Educación en Derechos Humanos Un estudio en 19 países: Desarrollo en las políticas de convivencia y seguridad escolar con enfoque de derechos', Instituto Interamericano de Derechos Humanos, San Jose, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Europe ===
In Europe, some countries have specific laws and policies to address homophobic and transphobic violence in educational settings. In Belgium, the Flemish Ministry for Education and Equal Opportunities issued a Common Declaration for a Gender-Sensitive and LGBT Friendly Policy in Schools in 2012, establishing a framework for sexuality education and providing guidelines for schools to develop LGBT-inclusive policies.&lt;ref&gt;Flemish Department of Education, 'Gender aware and LGBT friendly policies in education', Brussels, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flemish Government, 'The Common Declaration for a Gender Sensitive and LGBT Friendly Policy in Schools', 2012. [Online]. Available: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.unece.org/&lt;/nowiki&gt; leadmin/DAM/env/ esd/11thMeetSC/Documents/2015_Good_practices_gender_in_ESD_BE_Flanders.pdf. [Accessed: 13-Aug-2012].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In France, although no national policy mentions homophobic and transphobic violence, the [[Ministry of National Education (France)|Ministry of Education's]] annual letter to principals has, since 2009, mentioned combating homophobia. Also, a 2012 governmental plan to combat homophobic and transphobic violence foresees specific actions in the education sector.&lt;ref&gt;Republique Française, 'Programme d'actions gouvernemental contre les violences et les discriminations commises à raison de l'orientation sexuelle ou de l'identité de genre', Premier Ministre, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In Portugal, the Students' Statute (2012) includes protection against discrimination based on both sexual orientation and gender identity/expression. In Sweden, the Discrimination Act (2009) explicitly bans discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity/expression in education, and obliges pre-schools, schools and universities to take proactive measures against violence. The United Kingdom's [[Equality Act 2010|Equality Act]] (2010) makes it a duty for schools to advance equality for their LGBT students. The Act explicitly mentions sexual orientation and gender reassignment and mandates that every school should have a behaviour policy preventing all forms of bullying.&lt;ref&gt;A. M. Mitchell, M. Gray, K. Green, and K. Beninger, 'What works in tackling homophobic, biphobic and transphobic (HBT) bullying among and young people? Evidence review and typology of initiatives', Government Equalities Of ce, London, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== The Pacific ===
In the Pacific, Australia's 2013 Sex Discrimination Act (Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Intersex Status) builds on previous state-level legislation and provides protections against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity/expression and intersex status (although some exemptions exist for some religious schools).&lt;ref&gt;T. Jones, Policy and Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender and Intersex Students. Cham, Heidelberg, New York, Dordrecht and London: Springer International Publishing, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in Australia, the State of Victoria's Department of Education and Early Childhood Development provides guidance to support [[sexual diversity]] in schools.&lt;ref&gt;DoEECD, 'Supporting Sexual Diversity in schools', Student Wellbeing &amp; Health Support Division Of ce for Government School Education Department of Education and Early Childhood Development Melbourne, Melbourne, State of Victoria, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In Fiji, the 2015 Policy on Child Protection in Schools requires schools to respect children's sexual orientation and to take action against bullying, including homophobic bullying. In New Zealand, the Ministry of Education published a Guide for Sexuality Education (2015) stating that school anti-bullying procedures should directly address bullying related to sexual orientation and gender identity/expression and that these incidents should be recorded as such and monitored. The comprehensive guidance also touches upon the curriculum, school uniforms, restroom facilities, procedures and policies in sports and extra-curricular activities.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Other countries in the region offer limited protection from school-related violence. Papua New Guinea alone specifically forbids such practice, while other countries protect children's health in general or offer only limited protection to children (in Tonga).&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Africa ===
In Africa, a review of policies on gender, diversity and violence in schools in Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa and Swaziland – conducted within the study supported by [[UNESCO]] in 2015 – found that countries have generic legal and policy frameworks (including in education) that provide a conducive environment to address violence in schools. In Lesotho and Swaziland, they are mostly related to child protection. Swaziland has an education sector policy where Schools as Centres of Care and Support (SCCS) are supposed to be 'protective and secure environments which accommodate all learners'. In Botswana and Namibia, [[Education For All|Education for All]] National Action Plans and other education policies clearly mention inclusive and non-discriminatory education. However, none of these policies make reference to sexual and gender diversity, except for South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO, 'Gender, diversity and violence in schools in five countries in Southern Africa: Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland (draft)', UNESCO, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Only South Africa has explicit policies to deal with homophobic bullying in education. The UNESCO-supported study found that, in interview, national policy-makers in Southern Africa suggest that the overall absence of specific policies may reflect the lack of reliable evidence on the nature, prevalence and impact of homophobic and transphobic violence in educational settings in the region, or that it is not considered a political priority. Where specific national legislation or policies (including in the education sector) are lacking, other entry points may exist to address homophobic and transphobic violence in educational institutions. These include international or regional human rights frameworks, but also general laws and policies against violence in educational institutions (for which additional guidance can be produced to detail how they apply to homophobic and transphobic violence). Finally, national anti-discrimination laws in Southern Africa (whether or not they mention sexual orientation and gender identity/expression) may also provide good entry points for the education sector to consider adopting new policies or upgrading existing ones.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Relevant curricula and learning materials ==
{{See also|Gender inequality in curricula}}

The second element of a comprehensive response to homophobic and transphobic violence in educational settings is relevant curricula and learning materials. Through their content and the way that they are delivered, curricula, learning materials and extra-curricular activities in educational settings – such as sports or theatre – convey influential messages about 'normality', legitimacy and power. Curricula are never neutral. Those that do not feature sexual and gender diversity convey the implicit message that people with diverse sexual orientations and gender identities/expressions are not part of society. Worse still, some curricula may explicitly convey negative messages about LGBTI people.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Curricula generally take one of four approaches for sexual and gender diversity:
* '''{{'}}Hostile' curricula:''' i.e. they explicitly convey negative messages about LGBTI people, which reinforce negative gender stereotypes and contribute to homophobic and transphobic violence. For example textbooks were withdrawn by the government in Croatia (in 2009) and Macedonia (in 2010) because they described homosexuality as a disease.
* '''{{'}}Non-inclusive' curricula:''' These omit any representation of sexual and gender diversity in their materials and, for example, ignore these aspects when discussing historical  gures who were LGBTI. This has the result of rendering LGBTI people 'invisible'. Most curricula worldwide fall into this category.
* '''{{'}}Inclusive' curricula:''' These convey implicit positive messages about sexual and gender diversity when they promote the human rights of all, regardless of personal characteristics including sexual orientation and gender identity/expression. These curricula are likely to also encourage gender equality.
* '''{{'}}Affirming' curricula:''' These convey explicit positive messages about sexual and gender diversity by featuring positive representations of LGBTI people and explicitly af rming their equality in dignity and rights. They provide educators with clear  guidelines and examples on how to refer to sexual orientation and gender identity/expression in a sensitive way.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; 
Hostile and non-inclusive curricula tend to exist in contexts where homophobia and transphobia are widespread. They do nothing to prevent or reduce violence based on sexual orientation and gender identity/expression. On the contrary, hostile curricula contribute to reinforcing stereotypical and patriarchal views of gender – indirectly leading to homophobic and transphobic violence. Meanwhile, by not challenging these stereotypical and patriarchal views, non-inclusive curricula also contribute to homophobic and transphobic violence in educational institutions. In contrast, inclusive or af rming curricula may discuss de nitions of masculinity and femininity and challenge existing stereotypes about gender and sexuality – contributing to increasing LGBTI students' feeling of belonging and safety.&lt;ref&gt;J. Kosciw, E. A. Greytak, N. A. Palmer, and M. J. Boesen, 'The 2013 National School Climate Survey: The experiences of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Youth in Our Nation's Schools', Gay, Lesbian &amp; Straight Education Network, New York, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;F. Bucx, F. Van Der Sman, and C. Jalvingh, 'Different class - Evaluation of the pilot Social safety of LGBT children at school: Summary and Conclusions', The Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Research suggests that curricula featuring sexual orientation and gender identity/expression positively impact students' and teachers' beliefs and attitudes, encouraging critical thinking and increasing feelings of safety at school.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They also help to address violence. The literature confirms that challenging homophobia and transphobia in education is most effective when LGBTI issues are reflected and featured through teaching and lesson plans, and when LGBTI people are positively portrayed across the curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;I.

This event decimated amphibian populations and spurred on the evolution of reptiles.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFalconLang 2010RainforestCollapse"/&gt;

[[Climate change]] is a natural event that has occurred throughout history. However, with the recent increased emission of [[CO2|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] in the Earth's atmosphere, [[abrupt climate change]] has occurred. It has been hypothesized that [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] [[greenhouse gas]] forcing has significantly influenced global climate since about 8000 [[before present]] (Van Hoof 2006).

Animals have had specific responses to climate change. [[Species]] respond to climate changes by migration, adaptation, or if neither of those occur, death. These migrations can sometimes follow an animal's preferred temperature, elevation, soil, etc., as said terrain moves due to climate change. Adaptation can be either genetic or [[phenological]], and death can occur in a local population only ([[Local extinction|extirpation]]) or as an entire species, otherwise known as [[extinction]].

Climate changes is projected to affect individual organisms, populations, species distributions and ecosystem composition and function both directly (ex. Increased temperatures and changes in precipitation) and indirectly (through climate changing the intensity and frequency of disturbances such as [[wildfire]]s and severe storms)(IPCC 2002).

Every organism has a unique set of preferences or requirements, a [[Ecological niche|niche]] and [[biodiversity]] has been tied to the diversity of animals' niches.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/6/4/544.full.pdf+html | author=Sahney, S.,  Benton, M.J. and Ferry, P.A. | year=2010 | title=Links between global taxonomic diversity, ecological diversity and the expansion of vertebrates on land | journal=Biology Letters | doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.1024 | volume = 6 | pages = 544–547 |format=PDF | issue=4 | pmid=20106856 | pmc=2936204}}&lt;/ref&gt; These can include or be affected by temperature, aridity, resource availability, habitat requirements, enemies, soil characteristics, competitors, and pollinators. Since the factors that compose a niche can be so complex and interconnected, the niches of many animals are bound to be affected by climate change (Parmesan Yohe 2003).

One study done by Camille Parmesan and [[Gary Yohe]] from University of Texas, Austin shows the global fingerprint of climate change on natural systems. The results of their global analysis of 334 species were recorded to demonstrate the correlation of patterns consistent with global climate change of the 20th century. Using the IPCC's ([[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]]) ‘levels of confidence’, this study proved significant nonrandom behavioral changes due to global climate change with very high confidence (&gt;95).  Furthermore, an accuracy of 74-91% change in species has displayed predicted change for species in response to climate change.

==Direct impact==

===Habitat fragmentation===
During the [[Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse]], the vast and lush rainforests of Euramerica were destroyed, fragmenting into small 'islands' in a much less diverse landscape. This event decimated amphibian populations and spurred on the evolution of reptiles.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFalconLang 2010RainforestCollapse"/&gt;

===Increased temperatures===
“Average Temperature changes do not in themselves provide simple predictions about ecological consequences. Average temperatures have changed more in high latitudes than in the tropics, but tropic species are likely more sensitive to temperature changes than temperate ones (IPCC 2008).”
[[Q10 (temperature coefficient)|Q&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;]] is the rate of change of a biological or chemical system as a consequence of increasing the temperature by 10&amp;nbsp;°C.

===Phenology===
[[Phenology]] is the study of life cycles of animals or plants due to seasonal or other variable climate changes. These responses by animals due to climate change may or may not be genetic{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Researchers are exploring ways to breed livestock like chickens, turkeys, and pigs to better withstand the heat.&lt;ref name="Robertson"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/climate-change/how-to-live-with-it/heat.html|title=Crop Changes National Geographic|last=Robertson|first=Ricky|work=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]|accessdate=3 March 2016| location="Madison"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Migration==

===Range shifts===
Range shifts are a natural response to climate change. Species with sufficient levels of mobility may respond quickly to environmental change, with species capable of undertaking long migratory movements likely to shift ranges first (Lundy ''et al.,'' 2010). Migration is not limited to animal populations - plants can migrate via [[Biological dispersal|passive seed dispersal]], establishing new individuals where conditions allow.

“The range of plants and animals are moving in response to recent changes in climate (Loarie 2009).” As Temperature increases, ecosystems are particularly threatened when their [[Ecological niche|niche]] has, essentially no where else to move to. This hindrance is particularly prevalent in mountain ranges for example. The speed at which climate is changing is derived from ratio of temporal and spatial gradients of mean annual near-surface temperature.

“Mountainous [[biomes]] require the slowest velocities to keep pace with climate change. In contrast, flatter biomes, such as flooded grasslands, mangroves and deserts require much greater velocities. Overall, there is a strong correlation between topographic slope and velocity from temperature change (Loarie 2009).”

Temperatures are expected to rise more than average in higher latitudes and at higher elevations. Animals living at lower elevations could migrate to higher elevations in response to climate change as temperatures rises. Whereas animals in higher elevations will eventually ‘run out of mountain’. “Results confirmed that protected large-scale elevation gradients retain diversity by allowing species to migrate in response to climate and vegetation change. The long-recognized importance of protecting landscapes has never been greater"(Moritz 2008).

Over the past 40 years, species have been extending their ranges toward the poles and populations have been migrating, developing, or reproducing earlier in the spring than previously (Huntley 2007).

==Adaptation==
The 2007, IPCC's report stated that “adaptation will be necessary to address impacts resulting from the warming which is already unavoidable due to past emissions.” (IPCC 2007)

===Changes in phenology===
As mentioned earlier, phenology is the changing of an animal’s behavior due to climatic circumstances. It may or may not be genetic. The genetic changes in animal populations have involved adaptation to the timing of seasonal events or to season length. For example, the Canadian red squirrels are reproducing earlier in the spring, thereby capitalizing on earlier spruce cone production (Huntley 2007).

Because of the increasing evidence that humans have had a significant impact on global climate over the previous centuries, many scientists wonder how species—and the ecosystems they live in—will adapt to these changes, or if they even can.

Usually the first and most easily detectable response is a change in the species’ phenotype, or its physical features. But there is a debate among scientists over whether or not these changes reflect an adaptive genetic evolution or simply [[phenotypic plasticity]].

A recently published study by Franks ''et al.'' sought to demonstrate that a shift in the annual flowering time of the Bassica Rapa plant in response to a multi-annual drought is southern California is in fact an adaptive evolutionary response. Based on the study, they concluded that post-drought genotypes appeared to be better adapted to shorter growing seasons than the pre-drought [[genotypes]], and that this was a result of adaptive evolution.

Huntley  counters the findings of Franks ''et al.'' (Huntley 2007) with a study by Wu, ''et al.'' (Wu L 1975) which provided evidence that not only different species but also different populations of the same species exhibited markedly different potentials for the selection of heavy metal tolerant genotypes.  This lead Bradshaw and McNeilly to conclude that different populations of the same species can adapt their phenology to survive in the short term and at local sites, but genetic variation across an entire species in response to rapid climate change is not possible (Bradshaw 1991).

Huntley concludes that while some evolution is likely to occur in some species in relation to global climate change, it is unlikely to be sufficient to [[Mitigation of global warming|mitigate the effects]] of said changes, especially if they occur as rapidly as has happened in the past.

In refuting the findings of Franks, ''et al.'', Huntley concludes:
“Although the demonstration of an evolutionary basis for a phenotypic response may be interesting, it is insufficient to overturn the conclusions of Bradshaw and McNeilly (Bradshaw 1991). Evolutionary adaptation is unlikely to be of major importance in the response of species to the climatic changes expected this century. Furthermore, even its limited potential is likely to be severely reduced as a consequence of habitat and population fragmentation, and of the rapidity and magnitude of the expected climatic changes, that together are likely to lead to rapid genetic impoverishment of many populations. A more likely outcome is that, rather as in the grasslands developed on heavy metal contaminated soils, a small number of species that happen to have the necessary genetic variance will come to dominate many plant communities, with potentially far-reaching consequences for biodiversity, ecosystem function and the [[ecosystem services]] upon which mankind depends (Huntley 2007).”

There are many ways that an animal can alter its behavior. The timing of their Reproduction, Mating, and migration, or the changes in abundance-

===Evolutionary===
Adaptive shifts in the timing of seasonal events should precede adaptive shifts of thermal optima or increased heat tolerance over evolutionary time, and that is the pattern that is emerging (Bradshaw 1991).

It has been hypothesized that as temperature increases, body size would decrease. Smaller body size would dissipate heat more efficiently, so in an increased temperature environment one would expect an animal to be smaller. The opposite also holds true, when temperature decreases, studies have shown with great correlation that body size increases. This was shown.&lt;ref&gt;(Smith 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate change has been associated with changes in plant as well as animal size.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Climate+change+causing+reduction+in+sizes+of+animals+and+plants%3a...-a0269950318  Climate change causing reduction in sizes of animals and plants] 2011, The Daily Star&lt;/ref&gt;

===Factors contributing to adaptation===
'''Short generational times''' as for many microbial disease organisms, small insects, common fisheries species and annual plants are thought to be highly more adaptive.

'''Wide dispersal areas''' allow animals to migrate and move to an environment better suitable in an effort to handle climate change.

'''Broad climatic tolerance''' is essentially the ability an animal has to withstand a large range of conditions. For example, the [[kangaroo]] has a very broad climatic tolerance.

'''Generalists''' are non-habitat species in that they are not restricted to a very specific location, environment, food source, etc. The American Coyote is an example of a generalist.

'''Opportunistic species''' feed and adapt to many changes.

===Factors hindering adaptation===
'''Long generation times''' limit the rate at which a species can become more varied.

'''Poorly dispersed animals''' are unable to migrate and essentially escape and survive the climate change.

'''Narrow climatic tolerance''' in animals inhibits animals to adapt because their basic survival needs cannot range in location, temperature or resources.

'''Population confined to one geographic location''' does not have a simple option of migration- such as animals that live in cold regions at the tops of low-lying mountains. These animals are in habitats that will run out as climate change increases and [[global warming]] becomes more impacted.

==Extinction or extirpation==
{{Main|Extinction risk from global warming}}

According to Stuart L. Pimm and his coauthors, human actions have raised species [[extinction]] or [[Local extinction|extirpation]] rates to three orders of magnitude above their [[Background extinction rate|natural, background rates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pimm | first1 = S.

A further 2150 species will be at risk of extinction" (Pimm 2009).

Given that species have limits to where they can exist, if conditions are unfavorable, mortality will be high and a species will be absent or rare in those areas. The corresponding graph representing this statement can be seen. The graph represents an experiment conducted using sand shrimp and their relative mortality rates based on salinity and temperature in a controlled environment. If climate change prompted the particular animal’s environment to become more or less salty, or too hot or too cold, and the organism was unable to move or to adapt, it would instead become extinct.

In Australia, the Grey-headed Robin is restricted to rainforests of the Wet Tropics region; and another population in the New Guinea highlands.
Although in some places it can be locally common, this bird's range is very restricted; it is found only in the north east of Queensland, and there only in the higher altitude rainforest. This is a projection of its range as climate change continues. This animal could be considered in danger of extinction.

A similar but more dramatic prediction is cast for the Lemuroid Ringtail Possum. As one can see, with a high enough temperature (climate) shift, this animal will become extinct.

Global warming as caused by humans is confirmed by the IPCC fourth Assessment to be “very likely”. This being the case, a tipping point may be reached for many species, leading ultimately to extinction (Pimm 2009).

Sometimes a species may react in one of the other two ways, by moving or by adapting, and yet find that its efforts do not save it from extinction. While not yet extinct, the Pied Flycatcher, a small insectivorous bird that migrates to Western Europe from Africa each spring, has declined to 10% of its former population. This has occurred at the same time as a main food source for the young flycatchers, caterpillars, have begun to peak much earlier. Although the birds have also begun to arrive earlier, they have not yet caught up to the peaking of the caterpillars. This individual species may or may not go extinct, but it goes to demonstrate that a species can sometimes begin to move or adapt and yet find itself dying nevertheless (Pimm 2009).

[[Image:Resistor cropped.jpg|thumb|A 100&amp;nbsp;kΩ, 5% axial-lead resistor]]

An '''electronic color code''' is used to indicate the values or ratings of electronic components, usually for [[resistor]]s, but also for [[capacitor]]s, [[inductor]]s, [[diode]]s and others. A separate code, the [[25-pair color code]], is used to identify wires in some [[telecommunication]]s cables. Different codes are used for wire leads on devices such as transformers or in building wiring.

==History==
{{anchor|RMA|RTMA|RETMA|EIA|IEC}}
The electronic color code was developed in the early 1920s by the [[Radio Manufacturers Association]] (RMA), later the  [[Radio Electronics Television Manufacturers' Association]] (RETMA), now part of the [[Electronic Industries Alliance]] (EIA)&lt;ref name="JEDEC_EIA"/&gt; Therefore, the code was known as '''RMA''', '''RTMA''', '''RETMA''' or '''EIA color code'''. In 1952, it was standardized in [[IEC 62:1952]] by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) and since 1963 also published as '''EIA RS-279'''.&lt;ref name="EIA_RS-279"/&gt; Originally only meant to be used for fixed resistors, the color code was extended to also cover capacitors with [[IEC 62:1968]]. The code was adopted by many national standards like [[DIN 40825]] (1973), [[BS 1852]] (1974) and [[IS 8186]] (1976). The current international standard defining marking codes for resistors and capacitors is [[IEC 60062:2016]]&lt;ref name="IEC_60062_2016"/&gt; and [[EN 60062:2016]]. In addition to the color code, these standards define a [[letter and digit code]] for resistors and capacitors.

Color bands were used because they were easily and cheaply printed on tiny components. However, there were drawbacks, especially for [[Color blindness|color blind]] people. Overheating of a component or dirt accumulation may make it impossible to distinguish brown from red or orange. Advances in printing technology have now made printed numbers more practical on small components. The values of components in [[surface mount]] packages are marked with printed alphanumeric codes instead of a color code.

==Resistor color-coding==
{{anchor|Resistor code}}
[[Image:2.26 kilo-ohm precision resistor.jpg|thumb|upright|A {{val|2260|ul=Ω}}, 1% precision resistor with 5 color bands ([[E96 series]]), from top 2-2-6-1-1; the last two brown bands indicate the multiplier (×10), and the 1% tolerance. The larger gap before the tolerance band is somewhat difficult to distinguish.]]
[[Image:Resistor bands.svg|A diagram of a resistor, with four color bands A, B, C, D from left to right]]
[[Image:4-Band Resistor.svg|A diagram of a 2.7&amp;nbsp;MΩ color-coded resistor.]]

To distinguish left from right there is a gap between the C and D bands.
{{ordered list
 | list-style-type=upper-alpha
 | The first significant figure of component value (left side)
 | The second significant figure (some precision resistors have a third significant figure, and thus five bands).
 | The decimal multiplier (number of trailing zeroes)
 | If present, indicates tolerance of value in percent (no band means 20%)
}}

In the above example, a resistor with bands of red, violet, green, and brown has first digit 2 (red; see table below), second digit 7 (violet), followed by 5 (green) zeroes: {{val|2,700,000|u=ohms}}. Gold signifies that the tolerance is ±5%.

Resistors manufactured for military use may also include a fifth band which indicates component failure rate ([[Reliability engineering|reliability]]); refer to [[MIL-HDBK]]-199&lt;ref name="MIL_HDBK_199C"/&gt; for further details.

Tight tolerance resistors may have three bands for significant figures rather than two, or an additional band indicating [[temperature coefficient]], in units of [[parts per million|ppm]]/[[Kelvin|K]].

All coded components have at least two value bands and a multiplier; other bands are optional.

The standard color code per [[IEC 60062:2016]] is as follows:
{{Electronic colour code}}
[[Image:Preferred values 05 Pengo.svg|thumb|One decade of the [[E12 series]] (there are twelve preferred values per decade of values) shown with their electronic color codes on [[resistors]]]]
[[Image:0-ohm.jpg|thumb|A [[Zero-ohm link|0&amp;nbsp;Ω resistor]], marked with a single black band]]

Resistors use [[E-series of preferred numbers#Lists|various E-series of preferred numbers]] for their specific values, which are determined by their [[tolerance (engineering)|tolerance]]. These values repeat for every decade of magnitude: ... 0.68, 6.8, 68, 680, ... For resistors of 20% tolerance the E6 series, with six values: 10, 15, 22, 33, 47, 68, then 100, 150, ... is used; each value is approximately the previous value multiplied by {{radic|10|6}}. For 10% tolerance resistors the E12 series, with {{radic|10|12}} as multiplier, is used; similar schemes up to E192, for 0.5% or tighter tolerance are used. The separation between the values is related to the tolerance so that adjacent values at the extremes of tolerance approximately just overlap; for example, in the E6 series {{nobr|10 + 20%}} is 12, while {{nobr|15 − 20%}} is also 12.

[[Zero ohm resistor]]s, marked with a single black band,&lt;ref name="NZO_NIC"/&gt; are lengths of wire wrapped in a resistor-like body which can be mounted on a [[printed-circuit board]] (PCB) by automatic component-insertion equipment. They are typically used on PCBs as insulating "bridges" where two traces would otherwise cross, or as soldered-in [[Jumper (computing)|jumper]] wires for setting configurations.

The "body-end-dot" or "body-tip-spot" system was used for cylindrical composition resistors sometimes still found in very old equipment; the first band was given by the body color, the second band by the color of one end of the resistor, and the multiplier by a dot or band around the middle of the resistor. The other end of the resistor was in the body color, silver, or gold for 20%, 10%, 5% tolerance (tighter tolerances were not routinely used).&lt;ref name="FTRC_1946"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BTS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RMA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Antique_Resistor"/&gt;

=={{anchor|Capacitor code}}Capacitor color-coding==
Capacitors may be marked with 4 or more colored bands or dots. The colors encode the first and second most significant digits of the value in picofarads, and the third color the decimal multiplier. Additional bands have meanings which may vary from one type to another. Low-tolerance capacitors may begin with the first 3 (rather than 2) digits of the value. It is usually, but not always, possible to work out what scheme is used by the particular colors used. Cylindrical capacitors marked with bands may look like [[resistor]]s.

Extra bands on ceramic capacitors identify the voltage rating class and temperature coefficient characteristics.&lt;ref name="FTRC_1946"/&gt; A broad black band was applied to some tubular paper capacitors to indicate the end that had the outer electrode; this allowed this end to be connected to chassis ground to provide some shielding against hum and noise pickup.

[[Polyester]] [[Film capacitor|film]] and "gum drop" [[Tantalum capacitor|tantalum electrolytic capacitors]] may also be color-coded to give the value, working voltage and tolerance.

=={{anchor|Inductor code}}Inductor color-coding==
Standards IEC&amp;nbsp;60062&amp;nbsp;/ EN&amp;nbsp;60062 do not define a color code for [[inductor]]s, but various manufacturers of physically small inductors utilize the resistor color code for this purpose, typically encoding [[inductance]] in microhenries.&lt;ref name="TDK_Inductors"/&gt; A white tolerance ring may indicate custom specifications.&lt;ref name="TDK_Inductors"/&gt;

The part number for small [[JEDEC]] "1N"-coded diodes—in the form "1N4148"—is sometimes encoded as three or four rings in the standard color code, omitting the "1N" prefix. The [[1N4148 signal diode|1N4148]] would then be coded as yellow (4), brown (1), yellow (4), grey (8).

==Postage stamp capacitors and war standard coding==
[[File:EIA Capacitor Color Codes.jpg|thumb|Postage-stamp [[mica capacitor]]s marked with the EIA 3-dot and 6-dot color codes, giving capacitance value, tolerance, working voltage, and temperature characteristic. This style of capacitor was used in vacuum-tube equipment.]]
Capacitors of the rectangular "postage stamp" form made for military use during World War II used ''American War Standard'' (AWS) or ''[[Joint Electronics Type Designation System|Joint Army Navy]]'' (JAN) coding in six dots stamped on the capacitor. An arrow on the top row of dots pointed to the right, indicating the reading order. From left to right the top dots were: either black, indicating JAN [[mica capacitor|mica]], or silver, indicating AWS paper; first significant digit; and second significant digit. The bottom three dots indicated temperature characteristic, tolerance, and decimal multiplier. The characteristic was black for {{val|±1000|u=ppm/°C}}, brown for ±500, red for ±200, orange for ±100, yellow for −20 to +100&amp;nbsp;ppm/°C, and green for 0 to +70&amp;nbsp;ppm/°C.

A similar six-dot code by EIA had the top row as first, second and third significant digits and the bottom row as voltage rating (in hundreds of volts; no color indicated 500 volts), tolerance, and multiplier. A three-dot EIA code was used for 500 volt 20% tolerance capacitors, and the dots signified first and second significant digits and the multiplier. Such capacitors were common in [[vacuum tube]] equipment and in surplus for a generation after the war but are unavailable now.&lt;ref name="ARRL77"/&gt;

==Mnemonics==
{{Further|List of electronic color code mnemonics}}
A useful [[mnemonic]] matches the first letter of the color code, in numeric order. Here are two that includes tolerance codes gold, silver, and none:

* '''B'''ad '''b'''eer '''r'''ots '''o'''ur '''y'''oung '''g'''uts '''b'''ut '''v'''odka '''g'''oes '''w'''ell – '''g'''et '''s'''ome '''n'''ow.&lt;ref name="Campbell_BUCD"/&gt;
* '''B''' '''B''' '''ROY''' of '''G'''reat '''B'''ritain had a '''V'''ery '''G'''ood '''W'''ife who wore '''Gold''' and '''Silver''' '''N'''ecklace.

The colors are sorted in the order of the visible light spectrum: red (2), orange (3), yellow (4), green (5), blue (6), violet (7). Black (0) has no energy, brown (1) has a little more, white (9) has everything and grey (8) is like white, but less intense.&lt;ref name="Clement"/&gt;

==Examples==
[[Image:Resistors color code.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Example color-coded resistors]]
From top to bottom:
* Green, blue, black, black, brown
** 560&amp;nbsp;ohms ±1%
* Red, red, orange, gold
** {{val|22000|u=ohms}} ±5%
* Yellow, violet, brown, gold
** 470&amp;nbsp;ohms ±5%
* Blue, grey, black, gold
** 68&amp;nbsp;ohms ±5%

The physical size of a resistor is indicative of the [[power (physics)|power]] it can dissipate.

There is an important difference between the use of three and of four bands to indicate resistance. The same resistance is encoded by:
*Red, red, ''orange'' = ''22'' followed by ''3'' zeroes = 220,00 (excluding default, silver, or gold tolerance)
*Red, red, ''black'', ''red'' = ''220'' followed by ''2'' zeroes = 22,000 (excluding brown or other band for tolerance)

==Transformer wiring color codes==
Power [[transformer]]s used in North American vacuum-tube equipment were often color-coded to identify the leads. Black was the primary connection, red secondary for the B+ (plate voltage), red with a yellow tracer was the [[center tap]] for the B+ full-wave rectifier winding, green or brown was the heater voltage for all tubes, yellow was the filament voltage for the rectifier tube (often a different voltage than other tube heaters). Two wires of each color were provided for each circuit, and phasing was not identified by the color code.

Audio transformers for vacuum tube equipment were coded blue for the finishing lead of the primary, red for the B+ lead of the primary, brown for a primary center tap, green for the finishing lead of the secondary, black for grid lead of the secondary, and yellow for a tapped secondary. Each lead had a different color since relative polarity or phase was more important for these transformers. Intermediate-frequency tuned transformers were coded blue and red for the primary and green and black for the secondary.&lt;ref name="ARRL77"/&gt;

==Other wiring codes==
Wires may be color-coded to identify their function, voltage class, polarity, phase or to identify the circuit in which they are used. The insulation of the wire may be solidly colored, or where more combinations are needed, one or two tracer stripes may be added. Some wiring color codes are set by national regulations, but often a color code is specific to a manufacturer or industry.

[[Building wiring]] under the US [[National Electrical Code]] and the [[Canadian Electrical Code]] is identified by colors to show energized and neutral conductors, grounding conductors and to identify phases. Other color codes are used in the UK and other areas to identify building wiring or flexible cable wiring.

Mains electrical wiring, both in a building and on equipment was once usually red for live, black for neutral, and green for earth, but this was changed as it was a hazard for color-blind people, who might confuse red and green; different countries use different conventions. Red and black are frequently used for positive and negative of battery or other single-voltage DC wiring.

[[Thermocouple]] wires and extension cables are identified by color code for the type of thermocouple; interchanging thermocouples with unsuitable extension wires destroys the accuracy of the measurement.

Automotive wiring is color-coded but standards vary by manufacturer; differing [[SAE International|SAE]] and [[DIN]] standards exist.

Modern [[personal computer]] peripheral cables and connectors are color-coded to simplify connection of speakers, microphones, mice, keyboards and other peripherals, usually according to the [[PC connector colors|PC99 scheme]].

A common convention for wiring systems in industrial buildings is: black jacket – AC less than {{val|1000|u=volts|fmt=commas}}, blue jacket – DC or communications, orange jacket – medium voltage {{val|2300|fmt=commas}} or {{val|4160|u=V|fmt=commas}}, red jacket {{val|13800|u=V|fmt=commas}} or higher. Red-jacketed cable is also used for relatively low-voltage [[fire alarm]] wiring, but has a much different appearance.

Local area network cables may also have non-standardised jacket colors identifying, for example, process control network vs. office automation networks, or to identify redundant network connections, but these codes vary by organization and facility.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2224">'''Elemental cost planning''' is a system of [[Cost planning]] and [[Cost control]], typically for buildings, which enables the cost of a scheme to be monitored during design development.

1951 saw the publication of the Ministry of Education Building Bulletin No 4 which essentially introduced the concept of elemental cost planning to the UK construction industry. Its Author was James Nisbet. The concept has been refined and developed over more than 50 years in the UK by [[BCIS]] (the Building Cost Information Service of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors).

Elemental Cost Planning relies upon the adoption of a Standard Form of Cost Analysis for buildings which allows costs to be compared on a common format and forms the basis of the benchmarking analysis central to the concept of Elemental Cost Plans.

It should :-
*Ensure that the tender amount is close to the first estimate, or that any likely difference between the two is anticipated and is acceptable. 
*Ensure that the money available for the projects is allocated consciously and economically to the various components and finishes.
*Always involves the measurement and pricing of approximate quantities at some stage of the process.
*Aim to achieve good value at the desired level of expenditure. 

Elemental cost planning is often referred to as 'designing to a cost' or 'target cost planning' since a cost limit is fixed for the scheme and the architect must then prepare a design not to exceed this cost.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10016">'''Environmental design''' is the process of addressing surrounding environmental parameters when devising plans, programs, policies, buildings, or products. Classical prudent design may have always considered environmental factors; however, the [[environmental movement]] beginning in the 1940s has made the concept more explicit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor=Richard Plunz|last=Chermayeff | first=Serge | title=Design and the public good : selected writings, 1930-1980 | publisher=MIT Press | publication-place=Cambridge, Massachusetts | year=1982 | isbn=978-0-262-16088-9 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental design can also refer to the applied arts and sciences dealing with creating the human-designed environment. These fields include [[architecture]], [[geography]], [[urban planning]], [[landscape architecture]], and [[interior design]]. Environmental design can also encompass interdisciplinary areas such as [[historical preservation]] and [[lighting]] design. In terms of a larger scope, environmental design has implications for the industrial design of products: innovative automobiles, [[wind-electricity]] generators, [[solar-electric]] equipment, and other kinds of equipment could serve as examples. Currently, the term has expanded to apply to ecological and [[sustainability]] issues.

==History==
[[File:Training meeting in a ecodesign stainless steel company in brazil.JPG|thumb|300px|right|The photo shows a training meeting with factory workers in a stainless steel [[ecodesign]] company from [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]].]]
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:i2amvaz.jpg|thumb|right|Reconstruction of an ancient house in the Greek city of [[Priene]]. {{deletable image-caption|Tuesday, 8 December 2009}}]] --&gt;
The first traceable concepts of environmental designs focused primarily on [[solar heating]], which began in [[Ancient Greece]] around 500 BCE. At the time, most of Greece had exhausted its supply of [[fuel wood|wood for fuel]], leading architects to design houses that would capture the [[solar energy]] of the sun.  The Greeks understood that the position of the sun varies throughout the year. For a latitude of 40 degrees in summer the sun is high in the south, at an angle of 70 degrees at the zenith, while in winter, the sun travels a lower trajectory, with a [[zenith]] of 26 degrees. Greek houses were built with south-facing façades which received little to no sun in the summer but would receive full sun in the winter, warming the house. Additionally, the southern orientation also protected the house from the colder northern winds. This clever arrangement of buildings influenced the use of the [[grid pattern]] of ancient cities. With the North-South orientation of the houses, the streets of Greek cities mainly ran East-West.

The practice of solar architecture continued with the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], who similarly had deforested much of their native [[Italian Peninsula]] by the first century BCE. The Roman ''[[heliocaminus]]'', literally 'solar furnace', functioned with the same aspects of the earlier Greek houses. The numerous public baths were oriented to the south. Roman architects added glass to windows to allow for the passage of light and to conserve interior heat as it could not escape. The Romans also used greenhouses to grow crops all year long and to cultivate the exotic plants coming from the far corners of the Empire. [[Pliny the Elder]] wrote of [[greenhouse]]s that supplied the kitchen of the [[Emperor Tiberius]] during the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://habitat.aq.upm.es/boletin/n9/amvaz.html|title=Una brevísima historia de la arquitectura solar|author=|date=|journal=Boletín CF+S|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the solar orientation of buildings and the use of glass as a solar heat collector, the ancients knew other ways of harnessing solar energy. The Greeks, Romans and Chinese developed [[curved mirror]]s that could concentrate the sun's rays on an object with enough intensity to make it burn in seconds. The solar reflectors were often made of polished silver, copper or brass.

Early roots of modern environmental design began in the late 19th Century with writer/designer [[William Morris]], who rejected the use of industrialized materials and processes in wallpaper, fabrics and books his studio produced. He and others, such as [[John Ruskin]] felt that the industrial revolution would lead to harm done to nature and workers.

The narrative of Brian Danitz and Chris Zelov's documentary film ''[[Ecological Design: Inventing the Future]]'' asserts that in the decades after World War II, "The world was forced to confront the dark shadow of science and industry."  From the middle of the twentieth century, thinkers like [[Buckminster Fuller]] have acted as catalysts for a broadening and deepening of the concerns of environmental designers.  Nowadays, [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], [[appropriate technology]], [[organic horticulture]] and [[Organic agriculture|agriculture]], [[environmental restoration|land restoration]], [[New Urbanism]], and ecologically [[sustainable energy]] and waste systems are recognized considerations or options and may each find application.

By integrating renewable energy sources such as [[solar photovoltaic]], [[solar thermal]], and even [[geothermal energy]] into structures, it is possible to create [[zero emission]] buildings, where energy consumption is self-generating and non-polluting. It is also possible to construct "energy-plus buildings" which generate more energy than they consume, and the excess could then be sold to the grid. In the [[United States]], the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Green Building Rating System rates structures on their environmental sustainability.

==Environmental design and planning==
'''Environmental design and planning''' is the moniker used by several Ph.D. programs that take a multidisciplinary approach to the built environment. Typically environmental design and planning programs address architectural history or design (interior or exterior), city or regional planning, landscape architecture history or design, environmental planning, construction science, cultural geography, or historic preservation. Social science methods are frequently employed; aspects of sociology or psychology can be part of a research program.

The concept of "environmental" in these programs is quite broad and can encompass aspects of the natural, built, work, or social environments.

* Texas A &amp; M University offers a [http://archone.tamu.edu/architecture/grad_frame.html Ph.D. in architecture] that emphasizes environmental design.

==Examples==
Examples of the environmental design process include use of roadway noise computer models in design of noise barriers and use of roadway air dispersion models in analyzing and designing urban highways.

Designers consciously working within this more recent framework of philosophy and practice seek a blending of nature and technology, regarding ecology as the basis for design. Some believe that strategies of conservation, stewardship, and regeneration can be applied at all levels of scale from the individual building to the community, with benefit to the human individual and local and planetary ecosystems.

Specific examples of large scale environmental design projects include:
*[[Boston Transportation Planning Review]]
*BART - [[Bay Area Rapid Transit]] System Daly City Turn-back project and airport extension.
*[[Metropolitan Portland]], Oregon light rail system

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13874">In general, '''expansionism''' consists of policies of governments and states that involve territorial, military or economic expansion. While some have linked the term to promoting [[economic growth]] (in contrast to [[Steady-state economy|no growth]] or sustainable policies), more commonly expansionism refers to the doctrine of a state expanding its territorial base or economic influence. This occurs usually, though not necessarily, by means of military aggression. Compare [[empire-building]], [[colonialism]], and ''mensurable''.

[[Anarchism]], [[reunification]] or [[pan-nationalism]] are sometimes used to justify and legitimize expansionism, but only when the explicit goal is to reconquer territories that have been lost, or to take over ancestral lands. A simple territorial dispute, such as a border dispute, is not usually referred to as expansionism.

Countries with nuclear weapons are more likely to exhibit expansionist behavior; particularly, if the state is not a democracy, and even if such state's public ideology is non-interference. Depending on chosen strategy, expansionism manifests in brute force or any threat of it, or in economic measures (a debt trap through infrastructure "investments" via burdensome loans), active measures (such as espionage, sabotage, manipulation of critical infrastructure), or a combination thereof. With conflicts that involve war, mutual accusations of expansionism are inevitable between nuclear powers that have strategic overlap.

==Past examples==
{{expand section|more historical examples|date=November 2017}} 
The militarist and nationalistic reign of [[Czar Nicholas I]] (1825–1855) led to wars of conquest against [[Russo-Persian War (1826–1828)|Persia (1826–1828)]] and [[Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829)|Turkey (1828–1829)]]. Various rebel tribes in the [[Caucasus]] region were crushed. A [[November Uprising|Polish revolt]] in 1830 was ruthlessly crushed. Russian troops in 1848 crossed into [[Austria-Hungary]] to put down the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|Hungarian revolt]]. [[Russification]] policies were implemented to weaken minority ethnic groups. Nicholas also built the [[Kremlin Palace]] and a new cathedral in Saint Petersburg. But [[Pan-slavism]] ambition led to further war with Turkey (the [[Sick man of Europe]]) in 1853 provoked Britain and France into [[Crimean War|invading Crimea]], and Nicholas died, supposedly of grief at his defeat. &lt;ref&gt; [[Orlando Figes]], Crimea, Penguin, 2011, chapter one &lt;/ref&gt;

The German [[Second Reich]] (1871–1918) underwent an industrial revolution under [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]], who also reformed and expanded the army. Poles and Catholics were persecuted. Colonies were acquired in Africa and China. In 1890, [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] dismissed Bismarck and resolved to build a world-class Navy, which led to an [[arms race]] with Britain and thence to World War One. &lt;ref&gt; [[Allan Mallinson]], '1914; Fight the Good Fight', Bantam Press, 2013, chapter two &lt;/ref&gt;

From 1933 the [[Third Reich]] under Hitler laid claim to the [[Rhineland]], the [[Sudetenland]], unification (''[[Anschluss]]'') with Austria in 1938, and the whole of the Czech lands the following year. After war broke out, Hitler and Stalin divided Poland between Germany and the USSR. In a ''[[Drang nach Osten]]'' aimed at achieving ''[[Lebensraum]]'' for the German people, Germany invaded the USSR in 1941. &lt;ref&gt; [[Sebastian Haffner]], [[The Meaning of Hitler]], Phoenix, 2000, chapters 2,3 and 4 &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Colonialism]], a form of expansionism is the policy of a nation seeking to extend or retain its authority over other people or territories, generally with the aim of developing or exploiting them to the benefit of the colonizing country.&lt;ref&gt;''Colonialism'', Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language (1989 ed.) p. 291.; ''Colonialisme'', Nouveau Petit Robert de la langue française (1993 ed.), p. 456.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[History of colonialism|European colonial period]] was the era from the 15th century to the mid-20th century when several European powers had established colonies in the [[Americas]], [[Africa]] and [[Asia]].

[[Expansionist nationalism]] is an aggressive and radical form of [[nationalism]] that incorporates autonomous, patriotic sentiments with a belief in expansionism. The term was coined during the late nineteenth century as European powers indulged in the '[[Scramble for Africa]]' in the name of national glory, but has been most associated with militarist governments during the 20th century including [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist_regime_.281922.E2.80.931943.29|Fascist Italy]], [[Nazi Germany]], the [[Japanese empire]], and the [[Balkans]] countries of [[Albanian nationalism|Albania]] ([[Greater Albania]]), [[Bulgarian nationalism|Bulgaria]] ([[Greater Bulgaria]]), [[Croatian nationalism|Croatia]] ([[Greater Croatia]]), [[Hungarian nationalism|Hungary]] ([[Hungarian irredentism|Greater Hungary]]), [[Romanian nationalism|Romania]] ([[Greater Romania]]) and [[Serbian nationalism|Serbia]] ([[Greater Serbia]]).

==21st century==
===China===
The People's Republic of China is expanding its operations and influence in the [[South China Sea]], claiming possession of disputed offshore islands in the search for oil and gas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Tisdall]], 'Vietnam's fury at China's expansionism can be traced to a troubled history', [[The Guardian]], 15/5/2004&lt;/ref&gt; A major instrument of influence is the [[Belt and Road Initiative]].

===Israel===
[[Israel]] has tried to expand its territory and power through the occupation of the [[Syria|Syrian]] Golan Heights,&lt;ref&gt;https://theintercept.com/2018/01/23/israel-syria-safe-buffer-zone-golan-heights/&lt;/ref&gt; the killing of [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] civilians in the [[Gaza Strip]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/04/gaza-protest-latest-updates-180406092506561.html&lt;/ref&gt; warring with neighbouring [[Lebanon]] (2006) and openly considering future wars,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.economist.com/leaders/2006/08/17/nasrallah-wins-the-war&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.businessinsider.com/a-new-war-could-erupt-as-tensions-rise-between-israel-and-lebanon-2017-10&lt;/ref&gt; striking Syrian and Iranian forces that purport to defend the Syria against [[Daesh]] terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rt.com/news/437647-israel-strikes-syria-iran/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iran]], the largest [[Shi'ite]] state, has extended its influence in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tim Arango]], 'Iran Dominates in Iraq after US 'handed the country over'', [[The New York Times]], 15/7/2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
[[Russia]]'s behavior threatens the integrity and existence of [[NATO]] member states and Russia's non-NATO neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Walker |first=Peter |title=Russian expansionism may pose existential threat, says NATO general |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=2015-02-20 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/20/russia-existential-threat-british-nato-general |accessdate=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The events associated with Russia are: the 2008 [[Russo-Georgian War]] and Russia's [[Occupied territories of Georgia|occupation of South Ossetia and Abkhazia]]; the [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014–present)|Russian military intervention in Ukraine]], which began in 2014 with the [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|Annexation of Crimea]] and the [[War in Donbass]]; and the [[Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War|military intervention in Syria]].

===United States===
The [[United States]] is seen to be using its power to expand its influence. Criticism is meted out for large-scale events (wars); for expressing support in favor of opposition groups, and for aiding the rebel groups' aspirations to remove governments. The war in [[Afghanistan]] was begun in response to the [[September 11 attacks|9/11]] attacks; despite opposition by traditional allies such as [[France]], a war in [[Iraq]] was declared based on the inaccurate information of Iraq hosting weapons of mass destruction. No weapons of mass destruction were ever found, however a controversial [[Iraqi oil law|oil law]] was passed through American influence, largely privatising the valuable commodity of oil to foreign companies. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-afghanistan-announce-war-us-army-escalation-pakistan-a7905821.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2018/02/23/trump-administration-troops-can-stay-in-iraq-syria-indefinitely/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/13/opinion/13juhasz.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of the United States extends to: embargoing countries such as Cuba;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cuba-economy-un/us-trade-embargo-has-cost-cuba-130-billion-un-says-idUSKBN1IA00T&lt;/ref&gt; building military bases around the world, especially in the [[Arab countries]] of the [[Persian Gulf]];&lt;ref&gt;https://www.americansecurityproject.org/national-security-strategy/u-s-bases-in-the-middle-east/&lt;/ref&gt; supporting opposition groups in [[Libya]] and [[Syrian Civil War|Syria]] during the [[Arab Spring]] and the [[Syrian Civil War]];&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-usa-order/exclusive-obama-authorizes-secret-help-for-libya-rebels-idUSTRE72T6H220110330&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-turkey/turkey-to-u-s-end-support-for-syrian-kurd-ypg-or-risk-confrontation-idUSKBN1FE297&lt;/ref&gt; implementing sanctions against the leaderships of countries [[Venezuela]], [[Russia]], and Iran;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/world/europe/us-sanctions-turkey-pastor.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-russia-sanctions/us-senators-introduce-russia-sanctions-bill-from-hell-idUSKBN1KN22Q&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/21/us/politics/trump-maduro-venezuela-sanctions.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/10/global-powers-condemn-us-sanctions-against-iran-and-encourage-business.html&lt;/ref&gt; deploying its navy in the [[South China Sea]], widely seen as a way to counter Chinese claims in the South China Sea.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/2166910/us-navy-plans-major-show-strength-south-china-sea-warning&lt;/ref&gt;

The explicit rhetoric of president [[Donald Trump|Trump]] and his political satellites has had a damaging effect on the United States itself. Examples of such are the overt rhetoric advocating the overthrow of democratically-elected governments deemed undemocratic by the United States, such as in [[Venezuela]], [[Iran]], and [[Syria]];&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/08/trump-nicolas-maduro-overthrow-venezuelan-meetings&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-iran-opposition/trump-lawyer-giuliani-says-irans-government-will-be-overthrown-idUSKCN1M3005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.strategic-culture.org/news/2016/12/08/officials-obama-prioritized-defeating-assad-above-defeating-jihadists.html&lt;/ref&gt; the influencing of the blockade of countries such as [[Qatar]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/06/timeline-gcc-egyptian-discord-qatar-170605063154230.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent times, the United States is also seen to be asserting its dominance economically. Faced by a rapidly-internationalising Renminbi and a growing eurozone, the United States is using the global dominance of the US dollar in worldwide trade to indiscriminately sanction [[NATO]] allies such as [[Turkey]], as well as rival countries such as [[Russia]], Venezuela and Iran;&lt;ref&gt; https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/world/europe/us-sanctions-turkey-pastor.html &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-russia-sanctions/us-senators-introduce-russia-sanctions-bill-from-hell-idUSKBN1KN22Q &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/21/us/politics/trump-maduro-venezuela-sanctions.html &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/10/global-powers-condemn-us-sanctions-against-iran-and-encourage-business.html &lt;/ref&gt; using protectionist measures against traditional allies and fellow [[World Trade Organization|WTO]]-members, [[Canada]], [[Mexico]], and the [[European Union]];&lt;ref&gt;https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-trade-tariffs-in-us-canada-china-eu-mexico-world-2018-7&lt;/ref&gt; and initiating a major trade war with economic rival [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45294162&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideologies==

In the nineteenth century, theories of racial unity such as [[Pan-Germanism]], [[Pan-Slavism]], [[Pan-Turkism]] and the related [[Turanism]], evolved. In each case, the dominant nation (respectively, [[Prussia]], [[Russia]]&lt;ref&gt; [[Orlando Figes]], ''Crimea'', Penguin, 2011, p.89 &lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Ottoman Empire]], especially under [[Enver Pasha]],) used these theories to legitimise their expansionist policies.

==In popular culture==

[[George Orwell]]'s satirical novel ''[[Animal Farm]]'' is a fictional depiction, based on [[Stalin]]'s [[USSR]], of a new elite seizing power, establishing new rules and hierarchies, then expanding economically while compromising their ideals; while [[Robert Erskine Childers]] in ''[[The Riddle of the Sands]]'' portrayed the threatening nature of the German [[Second Reich]]. [[Elspeth Huxley]]'s novel [[Red Strangers]] shows the effects on local culture of colonial expansion into sub-Saharan Africa.

'''Female sperm storage''' is a biological process and often a type of [[sexual selection]] in which [[spermatozoa|sperm cells]] transferred to a female during mating are temporarily retained within a specific part of the reproductive tract before the [[oocyte]], or egg, is fertilized. The site of storage is variable among different animal taxa and ranges from structures that appear to function solely for sperm retention, such as insect [[spermatheca]]&lt;ref&gt;Klowden MJ. 2003. Spermatheca. In Resh VH and Cardé RT (eds.): Encyclopedia of Insects.

==Increased diversity of offspring ==
One important advantage female insects that store sperm gain is increased [[genetic diversity]] in their offspring.  There are many ways that females can alter offspring genetics to increase their success and diversity. An example of how this can be accomplished is in female [[Scathophaga]] that preferentially fertilize eggs to survive in different environments. Since many environments require different traits for success, females are somehow able to match sperm (acquired from multiple mates) that have the best genes for whichever environment in which they will develop.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.0014-3820.2000.tb00712.x |pmid=11108595 |title=Cryptic Female Choice in the Yellow Dung Fly Scathophaga Stercoraria (L.) |journal=Evolution |volume=54 |issue=5 |pages=1680–6 |year=2000 |last1=Ward |first1=Paul I }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the different properties of the environment, including temperature and thermal properties affect the female's sperm choice.&lt;ref name=cats&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1365-294X.2002.01558.x |pmid=12207727 |title=Field experiments on the distributions of eggs of different phosphoglucomutase (PGM) genotypes in the yellow dung fly Scathophaga stercoraria (L.) |journal=Molecular Ecology |volume=11 |issue=9 |pages=1781–5 |year=2002 |last1=Ward |first1=Paul I |last2=Vonwil |first2=Judith |last3=Scholte |first3=Ernst-Jan |last4=Knop |first4=Eva }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have also shown that ovipositing is nonrandom and females lay eggs with varying PGM([[phosphoglucomutase]]) genotypes in different environments in order to optimize offspring success. Females are acutely aware to their environment and manipulate the genetic diversity of their offspring in appropriate ways to ensure their success.

Another way sperm-storing females can alter the diversity of their offspring is controlling the relatedness to the males that provide them with sperm. [[Inbreeding depression]] can have a deleterious impact on populations of organisms and is due to mating of closely related individuals. To combat this effect, female insects appear to be able to sort out the sperm of relatives from the sperm of non-relatives to choose the best option to fertilize their eggs. Female crickets are able to preferentially store sperm of multiple unrelated males to that of their siblings; this results in more of the offspring having unrelated parentage. Being able to choose between sperm after coupling might be advantageous to females because choosing between mates precopulation may be more costly, or it may just be too difficult to tell males apart before mating.&lt;ref name=thunder&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1365-294X.2009.04301.x |pmid=19694961 |title=Promiscuous females avoid inbreeding by controlling sperm storage |journal=Molecular Ecology |volume=18 |issue=16 |pages=3340 |year=2009 |last1=Bretman |first1=Amanda |last2=Newcombe |first2=Devi |last3=Tregenza |first3=TOM }}&lt;/ref&gt; Females possess remarkable abilities to select sperm to store and to fertilize their eggs that will make their offspring diverse. Though it has been shown that a majority of female insect species can store sperm, specific examples that have been studied could include field crickets,&lt;ref name=thunder/&gt; dung flies &lt;ref name=cats/&gt; and Mediterranean fruit flies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1006/anbe.1999.1137 |pmid=10458875 |title=Postcopulatory sexual selection in Mediterranean fruit flies: Advantages for large and protein-fed males |journal=Animal Behaviour |volume=58 |issue=2 |pages=247–254 |year=1999 |last1=Taylor |first1=Phillip W |last2=Yuval |first2=Boaz }}&lt;/ref&gt; Females largely benefit from this mechanism, but males often can experience low fitness because their paternity is not secure.

Sperm stored often determines which male ends up fertilizing the most eggs. An example of this is seen in [[Red flour beetle#Polygamy in Red flour beetles.|Red Flour Beetles]], where most of the sperm is stored in the first mating. Another male can remove previously stored sperm to better chances of successful mating.

Antagonistic coevolution is the relationship between males and females where sexual morphology changes over time to change with the opposite's sex traits in order to achieve the maximum reproductive success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.0014-3820.2002.tb01386.x |pmid=12038533 |title=Sexually Antagonistic Coevolution in a Mating System: Combining Experimental and Comparative Approaches to Address Evolutionary Processes |journal=Evolution |volume=56 |issue=4 |pages=754–67 |year=2002 |last1=Rowe |first1=Locke |last2=Arnqvist |first2=Göran }}&lt;/ref&gt; One such development is alternative sperm storage sites, such as seminal receptacles, [[spermathecae]], and pseudospermathecae, that are complex and extremely variable to allow for more choice in sperm selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/jmor.10811 |pmid=19941380 |title=Functional morphology of the female reproductive apparatus of ''Stephanitis pyrioides'' (Heteroptera, Tingidae): A novel role for the pseudospermathecae |journal=Journal of Morphology |volume=271 |issue=4 |pages=473–82 |year=2009 |last1=Marchini |first1=Daniela |last2=Bene |first2=Giovanna Del |last3=Dallai |first3=Romano }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some cases, sperm storage sites can produce [[proteases]] that break down various proteins in male seminal fluid resulting in female selection in sperm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00493.x |pmid=18752616 |title=An Evolutionary Expressed Sequence Tag Analysis of Drosophila Spermatheca Genes |journal=Evolution |volume=62 |issue=11 |pages=2936–47 |year=2008 |last1=Prokupek |first1=Adrianne |last2=Hoffmann |first2=Federico |last3=Eyun |first3=Seong-il |last4=Moriyama |first4=Etsuko |last5=Zhou |first5=Min |last6=Harshman |first6=Lawrence }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like females, males have developed responses to counter evolutionary adaptations of the opposite sex. Responses in insects can vary in both genitalia and sperm structures, along with variations in behavior. Spiny male genitalia help to anchor the male to the female during copulation and remove sperm of previous males from female storage structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.0701170104 |pmid=17573531 |pmc=1904142 |title=Coevolution between harmful male genitalia and female resistance in seed beetles |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=104 |issue=26 |pages=10921–5 |year=2007 |last1=Ronn |first1=J |last2=Katvala |first2=M |last3=Arnqvist |first3=G }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Males have also developed alternative ways to copulate. In the case of the bed bug, males [[traumatic insemination|traumatically inseminate]] females, which allows faster passage of sperm to female sperm storage sites.&lt;ref name="Siva-Jothy et al."&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rspb.2002.2260 |pmid=12769466 |pmc=1691276 |title=A matter of taste: Direct detection of female mating status in the bedbug |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=270 |issue=1515 |pages=649–52 |year=2003 |last1=Siva-Jothy |first1=M. T |last2=Stutt |first2=A. D }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The sperm are received by the [[spermalege|mesospermalege]] and eventually reach the spermathecae, also referred to as [[Bed bug#Reproduction|seminal conceptacles]].

At the microscopic level, ''Drosophila'' males have differing sperm tail lengths that correspond to various sizes of female seminal receptacles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1076968 |pmid=12424377 |title=Sperm-Female Coevolution in Drosophila |journal=Science |volume=298 |issue=5596 |pages=1230–3 |year=2002 |last1=Miller |first1=G. T |last2=Pitnick |first2=S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Longer male sperm tail length has shown a greater reproductive success with a larger female seminal receptacle while sperm with short tail lengths have been found to be more successful in smaller seminal receptacles.

=={{anchor|cryptic female choice}}Cryptic female choice==
{{Main|Cryptic female choice}}
The ability to store and separate sperm from multiple males enables females to manipulate paternity by choosing which sperm fertilize their eggs, a process known as cryptic female choice. Evidence for this ability exists in many different taxa, including [[birds]], [[reptiles]], [[gastropods]], [[arachnids]], and [[insects]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2003.0142 |pmid=15252964 |pmc=1810032 |title=Female choice of young sperm in a genetically monogamous bird |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=271 |pages=S134–7 |year=2004 |last1=Wagner |first1=R.

As a result of clutches with greater variation in paternal genes and increased sperm competition, females can maximize both the genetic quality and number of offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.theriogenology.2009.07.002 |pmid=19632711 |title=Sperm storage in the vertebrate female reproductive tract: How does it work so well? |journal=Theriogenology |volume=73 |issue=6 |pages=713–22 |year=2010 |last1=Holt |first1=W.V |last2=Lloyd |first2=R.E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cryptic choice allows females to preferentially choose sperm. Females are thus able to mate multiple times and allocate sperm to their eggs according to paternal [[phenotype]], or according to other characteristics. In some cases, such as in the [[yellow dung fly]], certain male traits will affect the [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] of eggs laid in particular environmental conditions. Females can choose sperm based on male quality as a function of its interaction with the environment.&lt;ref name="cats"/&gt; In other species, such as the fly ''[[Dryomyza anilis]]'', females preferentially choose sperm from one storage location over another. Males of this species have developed behaviors, such as abdominal tapping, to increase their number of sperm stored in the favored storage site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1755-0998.2009.02754.x |pmid=21565024 |title=The assessment of insemination success in yellow dung flies using competitive PCR |journal=Molecular Ecology Resources |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=292–303 |year=2010 |last1=Bussière |first1=L.

C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanisms==

===Female muscular contractions===
Muscle contraction as a means of moving [[spermatozoa]] through the reproductive system into and out of the storage structures has been examined in [[Diptera]], [[Orthoptera]], and [[Lepidoptera]] as well as in the species ''[[Rhodnius prolixus]]'' and the [[boll weevil]]. In ''R. prolixus'', rhythmic peristaltic contractions of the oviduct cause contractions of the bursa copulatrix and [[spermatheca]] movement. This movement of the spermatheca results in spermatozoa migration into the spermathecal duct and into the spermatheca reservoir.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Davey |first1=KG |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/35/3/694 |title=The migration of spermatozoa in the female of ''Rhodnius prolixus'' |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |year=1958 |volume=35 |pages=694–701 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/1536488 |jstor=1536488 |title=The Internal Phenomena of Reproduction in Drosophila |journal=The Biological Bulletin |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=207–30 |year=1920 |last1=Nonidez |first1=José F }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Omura |first1=S |url=http://eprints.lib.hokudai.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2115/12719/1/40(3)_p111-128.pdf |title=Structure and function of the female genital system of ''Bombyx mori'' with special reference to the mechanism of fertilization |journal=Journal of the Faculty of Agriculture |volume=40 |issue=3 |year=1935 |pages=111–31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the boll weevil, contractions are also used to move sperm from the spermathecae so they can fertilize the egg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0022-1910(75)90099-2 |title=Functions of the spermathecal muscle of the boll weevil, Anthonomus grandis |journal=Journal of Insect Physiology |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=1275–8 |year=1975 |last1=Villavaso |first1=Eric J }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been observed in locusts, that the nervous system initiates female reproductive muscular contractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0022-1910(00)00149-9 |pmid=11249949 |title=Evidence of a neural loop involved in controlling spermathecal contractions in Locusta migratoria |journal=Journal of Insect Physiology |volume=47 |issue=6 |pages=607–616 |year=2001 |last1=Clark |first1=Julie |last2=Lange |first2=Angela B }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some species, such as ''R. prolixus'', the contractions that move spermatozoa into sperm storage are initiated by a male secretion in the ejaculate.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Male secretions, such as the [[glycoprotein]] ACP36D in ''[[Drosophila]]'', can also play a role in preparing the female reproductive system for sperm storage. It causes changes in uterine shape allowing spermatozoa access to the sperm storage organs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.0904029106 |jstor=40484802 |pmid=19805225 |pmc=2747198 |title=Acp36DE is required for uterine conformational changes in mated Drosophila females |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=106 |issue=37 |pages=15796–800 |year=2009 |last1=Avila |first1=F. W |last2=Wolfner |first2=M. F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Female insect nervous system===
The female [[Nervous system#Arthropods|insect nervous system]] affects many of the processes involved in sperm storage. The nervous system may signal for [[Muscle contraction|muscular contractions]], fluid absorption, and [[hormone]] release, all of which aid in moving the sperm into the storage organs.&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/s0022-1910(00)00149-9 |pmid=11249949 |title=Evidence of a neural loop involved in controlling spermathecal contractions in Locusta migratoria |journal=Journal of Insect Physiology |volume=47 |issue=6 |pages=607–616 |year=2001 |last1=Clark |first1=Julie |last2=Lange |first2=Angela B }}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the nervous system of female fruit flies (''Drosophila melanogaster'') was replaced with a masculinized nervous system through genetic manipulation, sperm storage was affected suggesting that the female nervous system is unique and required to store sperm properly.&lt;ref name="Arthur"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rspb.1998.0498 |jstor=51255 |pmc=1689365 |title=A female nervous system is necessary for normal sperm storage in Drosophila melanogaster: A masculinized nervous system is as good as none |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=265 |issue=1407 |pages=1749–53 |year=1998 |last1=Arthur |first1=B |last2=Hauschteck-Jungen |first2=E |last3=Nothiger |first3=R |last4=Ward |first4=P. I }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nervous system is responsible for several fertilization methods. In the [[migratory locust]] (''Locusta migratoria''), the presence of an egg in the genital chamber results in an increase of spermathecal contractions. As a result, sperm is released to fertilize the egg. A neural loop (from the VIIIth [[ganglion]] through the N2B [[nerve]] to N2B2, N2B3, N2B4, and N2B6b nerves) is then activated to direct the sperm to fertilize the egg via muscular contractions.&lt;ref name="Clark" /&gt; In the Caribbean fruit fly (''Anastrepha suspensa''), both the spermathecae and their ducts are innervated by an abdominal ganglion located under the first abdominal [[sternite]].&lt;ref name="Fritz"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1603/0013-8746(2002)095[0103:asagia]2.0.co;2 |title=A Single, Abdominal Ganglion in ''Anastrepha suspensa'' (Diptera: Tephritidae) and Its Innervation of the Female Sperm Storage Organs |journal=Annals of the Entomological Society of America |volume=95 |issue=1 |pages=103–8 |year=2002 |last1=Fritz |first1=Ann H }}&lt;/ref&gt; This location suggests that the sperm receptacle can compress and influence the amount of sperm taken in or released by the female fly.&lt;ref name="Fritz" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6482">In [[art history]], '''formalism''' is the study of art by analyzing and comparing form and [[Style (visual arts)|style]]. Its discussion also includes the way objects are made and their purely visual aspects. In painting, formalism emphasizes [[composition (art)|compositional]] elements such as color, line, shape, texture, and other perceptual aspects rather than the historical and social context. At its extreme, formalism in art history posits that everything necessary to comprehending a work of art is contained within the work of art. The context for the work, including the reason for its creation, the historical background, and the life of the artist, that is, its conceptual aspect is considered to be of secondary importance.

==History==
The historical origin of the modern form of the question of aesthetic formalism is usually dated to [[Immanuel Kant]] and the writing of his third Critique where Kant states: "Every form of the objects of sense is either ''figure'' (''Gestalt'') or ''play'' (''Spiel''). In the latter case it is either play of figures or the mere play of sensations. The charm (''Reiz'') of colors... may be added, but the delineations (''Zeichnung'') in the... composition (''Komposition'')... constitute the proper object of the pure judgment of taste."&lt;ref&gt;Kant. ''Critique of Judgment''. Section 14.8.&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher Donald Crawford has summarized Kant's position stating: "Thus, for Kant, form consists of the spatial... organization of elements: figure, shape, or delineation... In the parts of the ''Critique of Judgment'' in which form is emphasized as the essential aspect of beauty, Kant is consistently a pure formalist."&lt;ref&gt;Donald Crawford, ''Kant's Aesthetic Theory'' (Madison: The University of Wisconsin Press, 1974), p.&amp;nbsp;100.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary definition==
The philosopher Nick Zangwill of Glasgow University has defined formalism in art as referring to those properties "that are determined solely by sensory or physical properties—so long as the physical properties in question are not relations to other things and other times."&lt;ref&gt;Nick Zangwill, ''The Metaphysics of Beauty'' (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2001), p.&amp;nbsp;56, {{ISBN|0801438209}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher and architect Branko Mitrovic has defined formalism in art and architecture as "the doctrine that states that the aesthetic qualities of works of visual art derive from the visual and spatial properties."&lt;ref&gt;Branko Mitrović, ''Philosophy for architects'' (New York: Princeton Architectural Press, [2011]), p.&amp;nbsp;51.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the observation that works of art can in general contain formal properties and nonformal properties, the philosopher Nick Zangwill has delineated three types of formalism as they are encountered at the turn of the 21st century. First, Zangwill identifies ''extreme formalists'' who think "that all works of art are purely formal works—where a work is purely formal if all its aesthetic properties are formal aesthetic properties," then he defines ''anti-formalist'' thinkers as those who "think that no works of art have formal aesthetic properties."&lt;ref name="z84"&gt;Zangwill 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;84.&lt;/ref&gt; The third type which Zangwill identifies as representing the transition of the philosophy of aesthetics into the 21st century is that of ''moderate formalism'', where its principal exponents defend the principle "that all the aesthetic properties of works of art in a select class are formal, and second, that although many works of art outside that class have nonformal aesthetic properties, many of those works also have important formal aesthetic properties that must not be ignored."&lt;ref name="z84"/&gt;

The philosopher Michalle Gal has offered a moderate version of formalism, entitled "Deep Formalism", which is a symbolic formalism based on philosophical aestheticism. The artwork is defined by her as deep form: "a form steeped in content that cannot be extracted from it. Artistic content, since it has no existence or sense apart from the form, cannot actually be referred to, other than speculatively. The content seals the form in an opaque, non-reflective, productive symbol."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://doi.org/10.3726/978-3-0351-0787-6|title=Aestheticism: Deep Formalism and the Emergence of Modernist Aesthetics|last=Gal|first=Michalle|date=2015|publisher=Peter Lang AG|year=|isbn=9783035199925|location=|pages=14|language=en|doi=10.3726/978-3-0351-0787-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here she introduces a broad concept of symbol, an opaque-productive symbol: one that is not transparent to preconceived or pre-determined referents and meanings, but rather produces new ones.

==Uses in art history==
A formal analysis is an academic method in [[art history]] and criticism for [[analysis|analyzing]] works of [[art]]: "In order to perceive style, and understand it, art historians use 'formal analysis'. This means they describe things very carefully. These descriptions, which may include subjective vocabulary, are always accompanied by illustrations, so that there can be no doubt about what exists objectively".&lt;ref&gt;Review by: Clemency Chase Coggins of ''The Uses of Style in Archaeology'' edited by Margaret W. Conkey and Christine A. Hastorf, p.&amp;nbsp;233, ''Journal of Field Archaeology'', Vol. 19, No. 2 (Summer, 1992), pp.&amp;nbsp;232–34, Maney Publishing, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/529988 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[music]], a '''ghost note''' is a [[musical note]] with a [[rhythm]]ic value, but no discernible [[pitch (music)|pitch]] when played. In [[musical notation]], this is represented by an "X" for a [[note head]] instead of an oval, or parentheses around the note head.&lt;ref&gt;" [http://dictionary.onmusic.org/terms/1377-false_note False note]", ''OnMusic Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt; It should not be confused with the X-shaped notation that raises a note to a [[Sharp (music)|double sharp]].

On [[stringed instrument]]s, this is played by sounding a [[mute (music)|muted]] string. "Muted to the point where it is more percussive sounding than obvious and clear in pitch. There is a pitch, to be sure, but its musical value is more rhythmic than melodic or harmonic...they add momentum and drive to any bass line."&lt;ref name="Stuff"/&gt; Occurring in a [[rhythm]]ic [[figure (music)|figure]], they are purposely deemphasized, often to the point of near [[silence]]. In [[popular music]] drumming, these notes are played, "very softly between the 'main' notes," (off the [[beat (music)|beat]] on the [[sixteenth note]]s) most often on the [[snare drum]] in a [[drum kit]].&lt;ref name="Mattingly"&gt;Mattingly, Rick (2006). ''All About Drums'', p.61. Hal Leonard. {{ISBN|1-4234-0818-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ghost notes are often used by [[electric bass]] players and [[double bass]] players in a range of popular music and traditional music styles. In vocal music, it represents words that are spoken in rhythm rather than sung.

==Terminology==
Ghost notes are also called "dead notes", "muted notes", "silenced notes" or "false notes".

==Instrumental music==
Ghost notes, however, are not simply the unaccented notes in a pattern. The unaccented notes in such a pattern as a clave are considered to represent the mean level of emphasis—they are neither absolutely emphasized nor unemphasized. If one ''further'' deemphasizes one of these unaccented notes to the same or a similar extent to which the accented notes in the pattern are emphasized, then one has 'ghosted' that note. In a case in which a ghost note is deemphasized to the point of silence, that note then represents a rhythmic placeholder in much the same way as does a [[rest (music)|rest]]. This can be a very fine distinction, and the ability of an instrumentalist to differentiate between what is a ghost note and what is a rest is governed largely by the acoustic nature of the instrument.

[[Wind instrument]]s, including the human voice, and [[guitar]]s are examples of instruments generally capable of ghosting notes without making them synonymous with rests, while a [[pianist]] or [[percussionist]] would have more difficulty in creating this distinction because of the percussive nature of the instruments, which hampers the resolution of the volume [[gradient]] as one approaches silence. However, in such a case as that the ghost notes were clearly audible, while being far less prominent than the unaccented notes which represent the mean degree of emphasis within the example, then a percussionist could be said to create what we might define as ghost notes.

A frequent misconception is that [[grace note]]s and ghost notes are synonymous. A grace note is by definition decidedly shorter in length than the principal note which it 'graces', but in many examples the grace note receives a greater degree of accentuation (emphasis) than the principal itself, even though it is a much shorter note than the principal. In other words, while a grace note could be ghosted, the ghosting of notes is a function of volume{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} rather than of duration.

In drumming, a ghost note is played at very low volume,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HAnyNHCDmWYC&amp;pg=PT16&amp;dq=ghost+note+drumming&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=u8aeUuLnHNe_sQSkmILIBQ&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=ghost%20note%20drumming&amp;f=false | title=The Drum Set Crash Course | publisher=Alfred Music Publishing | author=Miller, Russ | year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; and typically on a [[snare drum]].&lt;ref name=drum /&gt; In musical notation, ghost notes are indicated in parenthesis surrounding the note.&lt;ref name=drum /&gt; According to ''The Drummer's Bible: How to Play Every Drum Style from Afro-Cuban to Zydeco'', the purpose of a ghost note is to "...be heard under the main sound of the groove. This produces a subtle 16th-note feel around a strong back beat or certain accents."&lt;ref name=drum&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q7S68Hq5nLoC&amp;pg=RA2-PA11-IA2&amp;dq=ghost+note+drumming&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=u8aeUuLnHNe_sQSkmILIBQ&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=ghost%20note%20drumming&amp;f=false | title=The Drummer's Bible: How to Play Every Drum Style from Afro-Cuban to Zydeco | publisher=See Sharp Press |author1=Barry, Mick  |author2=Gianni, Jason | year=2004 | pages=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''ghost note'', then, can have various meanings. The term '''''[[anti-accent]]''''' is more specific. Moreover, there exists a set of anti-accent marks to show gradation more specifically.
Percussion music in particular makes use of anti-accent marks, as follows:

#slightly softer than surrounding notes: ◡ (breve)
#significantly softer than surrounding notes: ( ) (note head in parentheses)
#much softer than surrounding notes: [ ] (note head in square brackets)

Examples can be heard in the drumming of [[Harvey Mason]], [[Mike Clark (jazz musician)|Mike Clark]], [[Bernard Purdie]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=Q7S68Hq5nLoC&amp;pg=RA1-PA17-IA6&amp;dq=bernard+purdie&amp;hl#v=onepage&amp;q=bernard%20purdie&amp;f=false Gianni, Jason (2003) ''The Drummer's Bible: How to Play Every Drum Style from Afro-Cuban to Zydeco'', p. 35.

=== Stringed instruments ===
[[Image:Bass ghost note groove.png|thumb|400px|''Bass'': Ghost notes indicated by 'x' shaped note heads.&lt;ref name="Stuff"&gt;Letsch, Glenn (2008). ''Stuff! Good Bass Players Should Know'', p.51-52. {{ISBN|978-1-4234-3138-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{audio|Bass ghost note groove.mid|Play}}]]

A [[guitarist]] wishing to ghost a note can decrease the pressure the fretting hand is exerting upon the strings without removing the hand from the fretboard (which would result in the sounding of the open pitches of those strings). This is sometimes called a 'scratch', and is considered a ghost note unless all the unaccented notes in the pattern were 'scratched' (in which case the scratches are unaccented notes).

On the [[double bass]] and [[electric bass]], as with the guitar, ghost notes can be performed by muting the strings, either with the fretting hand or the plucking/picking hand, which creates notes of indeterminate pitch that have a percussive quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OUWVAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=ghost+note+guitar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-sqeUq3dAvbLsQSp4IK4Bw&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=ghost%20note%20guitar&amp;f=false | title=Beginner Bass Guitar Lessons - Progressive: Teach Yourself How to Play Bass Guitar (Google eBook) | publisher=LearnToPlayMusic.com | author=Turner, Gary}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the electric bass, ghost notes are widely used in the [[slap bass]] style, as a way of creating a percussive, drum-like sound in [[funk]] and Latin music. On the double bass, percussive ghost notes are sometimes performed by slapping the strings against the fingerboard, which creates a percussive, "clacky" sound. With the double bass, slap-style ghost notes are used in [[rockabilly]], [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], and traditional blues and [[swing jazz]].

Bassists [[James Jamerson]] (of [[Motown]]), [[Carol Kaye]] (of Motown), [[Rocco Prestia]] (for Tower of Power), and [[Chuck Rainey]] (for [[Steely Dan]], [[Aretha Franklin]], and others) all include "tons of ghost notes done right" in their playing.&lt;ref name="Stuff"/&gt;

== Vocal music ==
In vocal music, especially in [[musical theater]], a ghost note represents that the lyrics must be spoken rather than sung, retaining the marked rhythm but having indeterminate pitch.  Notes with value less than a half note use an "X" instead of an oval as a note head.  Occasionally a half note or whole note is represented with an open diamond note head, often representing a scream or grunt.

As an extreme example, ghost notes are almost exclusively used in "Rock Island", the opening number of ''[[The Music Man]]''.

This notation may also indicate [[Sprechgesang|Sprechstimme]] or [[rapping]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37431">The '''Global 200''' is the list of [[ecoregion]]s identified by [[World Wide Fund for Nature|
WWF]], the global conservation organization, as priorities for conservation. According to WWF, an ecoregion is defined as a "relatively large unit of land or water containing a characteristic set of natural communities that share a large majority of their species dynamics, and environmental conditions".&lt;ref&gt;Olson, D. M. &amp; E. Dinerstein. 1998. The Global 200: A representation approach to conserving the Earth’s most biologically valuable ecoregions. ''Conservation Biol.'' 12:502–515.[http://planet.uwc.ac.za/nisl/Biodiversity/pdf/OlsonDinerstein1998.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olson, D. M., Dinerstein, E. 2002. The Global 200: Priority ecoregions for global conservation. ''Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden'' 89(2):199-224, [http://coastalforests.tfcg.org/pubs/Global%20200%20ecoregion.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Nature Conservancy. 1997. ''Designing a geography of hope: guidelines for ecoregion-based conservation in The Nature Conservancy''. The Nature Conservancy, Arlington, Virginia&lt;/ref&gt; So, for example, based on their levels of [[endemism]], Madagascar gets multiple listings, ancient Lake Baikal gets one, and the North American Great Lakes get none. 

The WWF assigns a conservation status to each ecoregion in the Global 200: '''critical or endangered'''; '''vulnerable'''; and '''relatively stable or intact'''. Over half of the ecoregions in the Global 200 are rated endangered.
{{TOC limit|3}}
==Background==
The WWF has identified 867 [[terrestrial ecoregion]]s across the Earth's land surface, as well as [[freshwater ecoregion|freshwater]] and [[marine ecoregion]]s. The goal of this classification system is to ensure that the full range of [[ecosystem]]s will be represented in regional conservation and development strategies. Of these ecoregions, the WWF selected the Global 200 as the ecoregions most crucial to the [[Conservation ethic|conservation]] of global [[biodiversity]]. The Global 200 list actually contains 238 ecoregions, made up of 142 terrestrial, 53 freshwater, and 43 marine ecoregions.

[[conservation movement|Conservationist]]s interested in preserving biodiversity have generally focused on the preservation of [[tropical moist broadleaf forests]] (commonly known as tropical rainforests) because it is estimated that they harbor one half of Earth's species. On the other hand, the WWF determined that a more comprehensive strategy for conserving global biodiversity should also consider the other half of species, as well as the [[ecosystem]]s that support them.

Several habitats, such as [[Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub]] [[biome]], were determined to be more threatened than tropical rain forests, and therefore require concerted conservation action. WWF maintains that "although conservation action typically takes place at the country level, patterns of biodiversity and ecological processes (e.g., migration) do not conform to political boundaries", which is why ecoregion-based conservation strategies are deemed essential.

===Classification===
Historically, zoologists and botanists have developed various classification systems that take into account the world's plant and animal communities. Two of the worldwide classification systems most commonly used today were summarized by [[Miklos Udvardy]] in 1975.

The Earth's land surface can be divided into eight [[biogeographical realms]] (formerly called kingdoms, and which the BBC calls [[ecozone]]s) that represent the major terrestrial communities of animals and plants, and are a synthesis of previous systems of [[floristic province]]s and faunal regions. The biome system classifies the world into ecosystem types (i.e. forests, grasslands, etc.) based on climate and vegetation. Each biogeographical realm contains multiple biomes, and biomes occur across several biogeographical realms. A system of [[biogeographical provinces]] was developed to identify specific geographic areas in each biogeographical realm that were of a consistent biome type, and shared distinct plant and animal communities. The WWF system represents a further refinement of the system of biomes (which the WWF calls "major habitat types"), biogeographical realms, and biogeographical provinces (the WWF scheme divides most biogeographical provinces into multiple smaller ecoregions).

===Selection process===
Based on a comprehensive list of [[ecoregion]]s, The Global 200 includes all major habitat types (biomes), all [[ecosystem]] types, and [[species]] from every major habitat type. It focuses on each major habitat type of every continent (such as [[tropical forest]]s or [[coral reef]]s). It uses [[ecoregion]]s as the unit of scale for comparison. WWF say ecoregions could be considered as conservation units at regional scale because they meet similar biological communities.

Some ecoregions were selected over other ecoregions of the same major habitat type (biome) or ecozone. Selection of the Global 200 relied on extensive studies of 19 terrestrial, freshwater, and marine major habitat types. Selection of the ecoregions was based on analyses of species richness, species [[endemic (ecology)|endemism]], unique higher [[taxon|taxa]], unusual ecological or evolutionary phenomena, and global rarity of major habitat type.

Global 200 ecoregion list is most helpful to conservation efforts at a regional scale: local [[deforestation]], destruction of swamp habitats, degradation of soils, etc. However, certain phenomena, such as bird or whale [[Fish migration|migration]], depend on more complex parameters not used to define the current [[database]], such as atmospheric currents and dynamic [[pelagic]] ecosystems. These would require gathering more information, and co-ordination of efforts between multiple ecoregions. However, the Global 200 ecoregions can help these efforts by identifying habitat sites and resting sites for migratory animals. It may also help identify the origin of [[invasive species]], and offer insights for slowing down or stopping their intrusion.

'''Gradient-index''' ('''GRIN''') '''optics''' is the branch of [[optics]] covering optical effects produced by a [[gradient]] of the [[refractive index]] of a material. Such gradual variation can be used to produce [[lens (optics)|lens]]es with flat surfaces, or lenses that do not have the [[Optical aberration|aberrations]] typical of traditional spherical lenses. Gradient-index lenses may have a refraction gradient that is spherical, axial, or radial.

== In nature ==
The [[Lens (anatomy)|lens]] of the [[eye]] is the most obvious example of gradient-index optics in nature. In the [[human eye]], the [[refractive index]] of the lens varies from approximately 1.406 in the central layers down to 1.386 in less dense layers of the lens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Optics |last=Hecht |first=Eugene |date=1987 |publisher=Addison-Wesley |last2=Zając |first2=Alfred |isbn=978-0201116090 |edition=2nd |location=Reading, Mass. |pages=178 |oclc=13761389}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the eye to image with good resolution and low aberration at both short and long distances.&lt;ref&gt;Shirk J S, Sandrock M, Scribner D, Fleet E, Stroman R, Baer E, Hilter A. (2006) ''NRL Review'' pp 53–61&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of gradient index optics in nature is the common [[mirage]] of a pool of water appearing on a road on a hot day. The pool is actually an image of the sky, apparently located on the road since light rays are being [[refracted]] (bent) from their normal straight path. This is due to the variation of refractive index between the hot, less dense air at the surface of the road, and the denser cool air above it. The variation in temperature (and thus density) of the air causes a gradient in its refractive index, causing it to increase with height.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Tsiboulia, A B (2003). "Gradient Index (GRIN) Lenses". In Ronald G. Driggers. ''Encyclopedia of Optical Engineering'', Volume 1. New York, NY: Marcel Dekker. 675-683. {{ISBN|9780824742508}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This index gradient causes refraction of light rays (at a shallow angle to the road) from the sky, bending them into the eye of the viewer, with their apparent location being the road's surface.

The Earth's atmosphere acts as a GRIN lens, allowing observers to see the sun for a few minutes after it is actually below the horizon, and observers can also view stars that are below the horizon.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This effect also allows for observation of electromagnetic signals from satellites after they have descended below the horizon, as in [[radio occultation]] measurements.

== Applications ==
The ability of GRIN lenses to have flat surfaces simplifies the mounting of the lens, which makes them useful where many very small lenses need to be mounted together, such as in [[photocopier]]s and [[image scanner|scanner]]s. The flat surface also allows a GRIN lens to be easily fused to an [[optical fiber]], to produce [[collimated light|collimated]] output.

In imaging applications, GRIN lenses are mainly used to reduce aberrations. The design of such lenses involves detailed calculations of aberrations as well as efficient manufacture of the lenses. A number of different materials have been used for GRIN lenses including optical glasses, plastics, [[germanium]], [[zinc selenide]], and [[sodium chloride]].

Certain optical fibres ([[graded-index fiber|graded-index fibres]]) are made with a radially-varying refractive index profile; this design strongly reduces the [[dispersion (optics)|modal dispersion]] of a [[multi-mode optical fiber]]. The radial variation in refractive index allows for a sinusoidal height distribution of [[ray (optics)|rays]] within the fibre, preventing the rays from leaving the [[Core (optical fiber)|core]]. This differs from traditional optical fibres, which rely on [[total internal reflection]], in that all modes of the GRIN fibres propagate at the same speed, allowing for a higher temporal bandwidth for the fibre.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, D T (1980). ''Applied Optics''. 19, 1035–1038&lt;/ref&gt;

Antireflection coatings are typically effective for narrow ranges of frequency or angle of incidence.  Graded-index materials are less constrained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=Jun-Chao|last2=Xiong|first2=Li-Min|last3=Fang|first3=Ming|last4=He|first4=Hong-Bo|title=Wide-angle and broadband graded-refractive-index antireflection coatings|journal=Chinese Physics B|date=2013|volume=22|issue=4|page=044201|doi=10.1088/1674-1056/22/4/044201|url=http://cpb.iphy.ac.cn/fileup/PDF/2013-4-044201.pdf|accessdate=13 May 2016|bibcode=2013ChPhB..22d4201Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Manufacture ==
GRIN lenses are made by several techniques:
* [[Neutron]] irradiation – [[Boron]]-rich glass is bombarded with neutrons to cause a change in the boron concentration, and thus the refractive index of the lens.&lt;ref&gt;Sinai P, (1970). ''Applied Optics''. 10, 99-104&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Chemical vapour deposition]] – Involving the deposition of different glass with varying refractive indexes, onto a surface to produce a cumulative refractive change.&lt;ref&gt;Keck D B and Olshansky R, "Optical Waveguide Having Optimal Index Gradient," U.S. Patent 3,904,268 (9 Sept. 1975).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Partial [[polymerisation]] – An organic [[monomer]] is partially polymerized using [[ultraviolet light]] at varying intensities to give a refractive gradient.&lt;ref&gt;Moore R S, "Plastic Optical Element Having Refractive Index Gradient," U.S. Patent 3,718,383 (Feb. 1973).&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ion exchange]] – Glass is immersed into a liquid melt with [[lithium]] ions. As a result of [[diffusion]], [[sodium]] ions in the glass are partially exchanged with lithium ones, with a larger amount of exchange occurring at the edge. Thus the sample obtains a gradient material structure and a corresponding gradient of the refractive index.&lt;ref&gt;Hensler J R, "Method of Producing a Refractive Index Gradient in Glass," U.S. Patent 3,873,408 (25 Mar. 1975).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ion Stuffing – [[Phase (matter)|Phase]] separation of a specific glass causes pores to form, which can later be filled using a variety of [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]]s or concentration of salts to give a varying gradient.&lt;ref&gt;Mohr R K, Wilder J A, Macedo P B, and Gupta P K, in ''Digest of Topical Meeting on Gradient- index Optical Imaging Systems,'' Optical Society of America, Washington, D C (1979), paper WAL.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Direct laser writing]] – While point-by-point exposing the pre-designed structure an exposure dose is varied (scanning speed, laser power, etc.). This corresponds to spatially tunable monomer-to-polymer degree-of-conversion resulting to a different refractive index. The method is applicable to free-form micro-optical elements and multi-component optics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zukauskas|first1=Albertas|last2=Matulaitiene|first2=Ieva|last3=Paipulas|first3=Domas|last4=Niaura|first4=Gedinimas|last5=Malinauskas|first5=Mangirdas|last6=Gadonas|first6=Roaldas|title=Tuning the refractive index in 3D direct laser writing lithography: towards GRIN microoptics|journal=Laser &amp; Photonics Reviews|date=2015|volume=9|issue=6|page=1863–8899|doi=10.1002/lpor.201500170|bibcode=2015LPRv....9..706Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1854, [[James Clerk Maxwell|J C Maxwell]] suggested a lens whose refractive index distribution would allow for every region of space to be sharply imaged. Known as the [[Maxwell fish-eye|''Maxwell fisheye lens'']], it involves a spherical index function and would be expected to be spherical in shape as well.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, J C  (1854). ''Cambridge and Dublin Math. J.'' 8, 188&lt;/ref&gt; (Maxwell, 1854). This lens, however, is impractical to make and has little usefulness since only points on the surface and within the lens are sharply imaged and extended objects suffer from extreme aberrations.  In 1905, [[Robert W. Wood|R W Wood]] used a dipping technique creating a gelatin cylinder with a refractive index gradient that varied symmetrically with the radial distance from the axis. Disk-shaped slices of the cylinder were later shown to have plane faces with radial index distribution.  He showed that even though the faces of the lens were flat, they acted like converging and diverging lens depending on whether the index was a decreasing or increasing relative to the radial distance.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, R W (1905). ''Physical Optics'', p.&amp;nbsp;71. Macmillan, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, a posthumous book of [[Rudolf Luneburg|R. K. Luneburg]] was published in which he described a [[Luneburg lens|lens]] that focuses incident parallel rays of light onto a point on the opposite surface of the lens.&lt;ref&gt;Luneburg, R K (1964). ''Mathematical Theory of Optics''. Univ. of California Press, Berkeley.&lt;/ref&gt; This also limits the applications of the lens because it is difficult to use it to focus visible light; however, it has some usefulness in [[microwave]] applications.

== Theory ==
An inhomogeneous gradient-index lens possesses a refractive index whose change follows the function 
&lt;math&gt;n=f(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt; of the coordinates of the region of interest in the medium. According to [[Fermat's principle]], the light path integral (''L''), taken along a [[Ray (optics)|ray of light]] joining any two points of a [[Optical medium|medium]], is [[Stationary process|stationary]] relative to its value for any nearby curve joining the two points. The light path integral is given by the equation
:&lt;math alt="L = \int_{S_0}^S n ds"&gt;L=\int_{S_o}^{S}n\,ds&lt;/math&gt;, where ''n'' is the refractive index and ''S'' is the arc length of the curve. If [[Cartesian coordinate]]s are used, this equation is modified to incorporate the change in arc length for a spherical gradient, to each physical dimension:
:&lt;math alt="L = \int_{S_0}^S n(x,y,z)(x'^2 + y'^2 + z'^2)^(1/2)  ds"&gt;L=\int_{S_o}^{S}n(x,y,z)\sqrt{x'^{2}+y'^{2}+z'^{2}}\, ds&lt;/math&gt;
where prime corresponds to d/d''s.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Gradient index optics |last=Marchland |first=Erich W. |date=1978 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0124707504 |location=New York |oclc=4497777}}&lt;/ref&gt; The light path integral is able to characterize the path of light through the lens in a qualitative manner, such that the lens may be easily reproduced in the future.

The refractive index gradient of GRIN lenses can be mathematically modelled according to the method of production used. For example, GRIN lenses made from a radial gradient index material, such as [[SELFOC Microlens]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flores-Arias|first=M.T.|last2=Bao|first2=C.|last3=Castelo|first3=A.|last4=Perez|first4=M.V.|last5=Gomez-Reino|first5=C.|date=2006-10-15|title=Crossover interconnects in gradient-index planar optics|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0030401806005712|journal=Optics Communications|language=en|volume=266|issue=2|pages=490–494|doi=10.1016/j.optcom.2006.05.049|issn=0030-4018|via=ScienceDirect|bibcode=2006OptCo.266..490F}}&lt;/ref&gt; have a refractive index that varies according to:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7470">'''Hybrid inviability''' is a [[Reproductive isolation|post-zygotic barrier]], which reduces a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]'s capacity to mature into a healthy, fit adult.&lt;ref&gt;Hybrid inviability. (2009). In Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved November 03, 2009, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online: http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/278018/hybrid-inviability&lt;/ref&gt;  The relatively low health of these hybrids relative to [[Pure breed|pure-breed]] individuals prevents [[gene flow]] between species.  Thus, hybrid inviability acts as an [[Isolating mechanisms|isolating mechanism]], limiting [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] and allowing for the differentiation of species.
	
The barrier of hybrid inviability occurs after mating species overcome pre-zygotic barriers (behavioral, mechanical, etc.) to produce a [[zygote]].  The barrier emerges from the cumulative effect of parental [[gene]]s; these conflicting genes interfere with the [[embryo]]'s development and prevents its [[Fetal development|maturation]].  Most often, the hybrid embryo dies before birth.  However, sometimes, the offspring develops fully with mixed traits, forming a frail, often [[Infertility|infertile]] adult.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, N. A., J. B. Reece, L. A. Urry, M. L. Cain, S. A. Wasserman, P. V. Minorsky, and R. B. Jackson. 2008. Biology: Eighth Ed. San Francisco, CA:491.&lt;/ref&gt;  This hybrid displays reduced fitness, marked by decreased rates of [[:wikt:survival|survival]] and [[reproduction]] relative to the parent species.  The offspring fails to compete with purebred individuals, limiting genes flow between species.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, S., and J. C. Herron. 2007. Evolutionary Analysis:Fourth Ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:627.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolution of Hybrid Inviability in Tetrapods ==
	
In the 1970s, [[Allan C. Wilson]] and his colleagues first investigated the evolution of hybrid inviability in [[tetrapod]]s, specifically [[mammal]]s, [[bird]]s, and [[frog]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Prager, E. M., and A. C. Wilson. 1975. Slow evolutionary loss of the potential for interspecific hybridization in birds: a manifestation of slow regulatory evolution. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 72:200-204.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, A. C., L. R. Maxson, and V. M. Sarich. 1974. Two types of molecular evolution: evidence from studies of interspecific hybridization. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 71:2843-2847.
&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Recognizing that hybrid viability decreases with time, the researchers used [[molecular clock]]s to quantify [[divergence]] time.  They identified how long ago the [[common ancestor]] of hybridizing species diverged into two lines, and found that bird and frog species can produce viable hybrids up to twenty million years after [[speciation]].  In addition, the researchers showed that mammal species can only produce viable hybrids up to two or three million years after speciation.

Wilson et al. (1974) proposes two [[Hypothesis|hypotheses]] to explain the relatively faster [[evolution]] of hybrid inviability in mammals: the Regulatory and the Immunological Hypotheses.  Subsequent research finds support for these hypotheses.

'''The Regulatory Hypothesis''' accounts for two characteristics of mammals, and explains the general formation of hybrid inviability in mammals, birds, and frogs.

First, mammals display relatively lower protein diversity than frogs.  As Wilson et al. (1974) suggests, “mammals that can hybridize with each other differ only slightly at the protein level, whereas frogs that differ substantially in [[protein sequence]] hybridize readily.”  This analysis suggests that gene divergence is not the only determinate of hybridization in mammals, birds, or frogs.
	
Second, the evolution of anatomical diversity occurred far faster in mammals than in either birds or frogs.  As Fitzpatrick (2004) indicates, “the morphological disparities among [[bat]]s, [[naked mole-rat|mole-rat]]s, and [[whale]]s are more dramatic than any disparities in birds and frogs.”  This anatomical diversity is evidence for the diversification of [[Regulation of gene expression|regulatory system]]s.  This mammalian characteristic suggests that, although mammals are genetically similar, dramatic changes in regulatory genes caused distinct developmental differences.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick, B. M. 2004. Rates of evolution of hybrid viability in birds and mammals. Evolution 58:1865-1870.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Regulatory Hypotheses specifically attributes hybrid inviability in mammals, birds, and frogs to differences in [[gene regulation]]. It proposes that hybrid inviability evolved faster in mammalian [[Taxon|taxa]] because mammals have accumulated significantly more changes in regulatory systems than birds or frogs, and it suggests that organisms with distinctly different systems of gene regulation may not produce viable hybrids.

Wilson et al. (1974) recognizes that the development of embryos in the mammalian [[placenta]] requires regulatory compatibility.  Both the regulatory genes of the [[sperm]] and [[Egg (biology)|egg]] contribute to the expression of other protein-coding genes in the zygote; if certain regulatory genes are not expressed or are expressed at the wrong time, the inter-specific zygote will abort or develop unhealthy traits.  Moreover, because the development of the zygote depends on maternal characteristics, such as cytoplasmic determinants, the regulatory traits of the mother may not support the hybrid's developmental needs. 

'''The Immunological Hypothesis''' proposes that the divergence of certain protein structures associated with mother and child causes hybrid inviability.  The hypothesis applies only to mammals, where [[fertilization]] and development is internal.  In birds and in frogs, fertilization is primarily external, and the mother’s [[immune system]] does not interfere with [[fetal development]].	 

This hypothesis stems from the immunological characteristics of the placenta, where the growing [[fetus]] is in constant contact with the fluids and tissues of the mother.  Variation within species and variation between species may contribute to fetal-maternal incompatibility, and according to the hypothesis, if the proteins of the fetus varies significantly from the proteins of the placenta, the mother may produce [[Antibody|anti-bodies]] that will attack and abort the fetus.  Therefore, if the fetal proteins of the father species are incompatible the mother's placental proteins, the mother's immune system may abort the embryo.
	
Evidence for the Immunological Hypothesis varies considerably.  Wilson et al. (1974) recognizes studies that provide no support to the Immunological Hypotheses.  In these experiments, the use of [[Immune suppressant|immunological suppressants]] provided no additional viability to inter-specific hybrids.  In contrast, Elliot and Crespi (2006) documents the effects of placental immunology on hybrid inviability, showing that mammals with [[Hemochorial placentation|hemochorial placentas]] more readily hybridize than mammals with [[epitheliochorial]] or [[Endotheliochorial placentation|endotheliochorial placentas]].  These different placenta types possess divergent immunological systems, and consequently, they cause varying degrees of hybrid inviability.&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, M. G., and B. J. Crespi. 2006. Placental invasiveness mediates the evolution of hybrid inviability in mammals. Am. Nat. 168:114-120.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''IT risk management''' is the application of [[risk management]] methods to [[information technology]] in order to manage [[IT risk]], i.e.:
:''The business risk associated with the use, ownership, operation, involvement, influence and adoption of IT within an enterprise or organization''
&lt;!----- transclusion --------&gt;
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;
IT risk management can be considered a component of a wider [[enterprise risk management]] system.&lt;ref name=RISKITW&gt;[http://www.isaca.org/Knowledge-Center/Research/Documents/RiskIT-FW-18Nov09-Research.pdf ISACA THE RISK IT FRAMEWORK (registration required)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The establishment, maintenance and continuous update of an [[Information security management system]] (ISMS) provide a strong indication that a company is using a systematic approach for the identification, assessment and management of information security risks.&lt;ref name=ENISAFULL&gt;[http://www.enisa.europa.eu/act/rm/cr/risk-management-inventory/files/deliverables/risk-management-principles-and-inventories-for-risk-management-risk-assessment-methods-and-tools/at_download/fullReport Enisa Risk management, Risk assessment inventory, page 46]&lt;/ref&gt;

Different methodologies have been proposed to manage IT risks, each of them divided into processes and steps.&lt;ref name=Vacca1&gt;{{cite book

According to the [[Risk IT]] framework,&lt;ref name=RISKITW/&gt; this encompasses not only the negative impact of operations and service delivery which can bring destruction or reduction of the value of the organization, but also the benefit enabling risk associated to missing opportunities to use technology to enable or enhance business or the IT project management for aspects like overspending or late delivery with adverse business impact.{{clarify|date=September 2017|post-text=incomprehensible sentence}}

Because [[Risk#Risk as a vector quantity|risk]] is strictly tied to uncertainty, [[decision theory]] should be applied to manage risk as a science, i.e. rationally making choices under uncertainty.

Generally speaking, [[risk]] is the product of likelihood times [[result|impact]] (Risk = Likelihood * Impact).&lt;ref&gt;"Risk is a combination of the likelihood of an occurrence of a hazardous event or exposure(s) and the severity of injury or ill health that can be caused by the event or exposure(s)" (OHSAS 18001:2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

The measure of an IT risk can be determined as a product of threat, vulnerability and [[asset (computing)|asset]] values:&lt;ref name=Vacca&gt;{{cite book

:&lt;math&gt;Risk = Threat * Vulnerability * Asset&lt;/math&gt;

A more current Risk management framework for IT Risk would be the TIK framework:
:&lt;math&gt;Risk = ((Vulnerability * Threat) / Counter Measure) * Asset Value at Risk&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://it-risk-management.com/ IT Risk Management]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==

&lt;!----- transclusion --------&gt;
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;
The [[Certified Information Systems Auditor]] Review Manual 2006 produced by ISACA, an international professional association focused on IT Governance, provides the following definition of risk management: ''"Risk management is the process of identifying [[vulnerability (computing)|vulnerabilities]] and [[threat (computer)|threats]] to the information resources used by an organization in achieving business objectives, and deciding what [[countermeasure (computer)|countermeasures]], if any, to take in reducing risk to an acceptable level, based on the value of the information resource to the organization."''&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 | last = ISACA
 | title = CISA Review Manual 2006
 | publisher = [http://www.isaca.org/ Information Systems Audit and Control Association]
 | year = 2006
 | pages = 85
 | isbn = 1-933284-15-3 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;
&lt;!----- transclusion END HERE BUT FOLLOWS --------&gt;

There is two things in this definition that may need some clarification. First, the ''process'' of risk management is an ongoing iterative [[Business process|process]]. It must be repeated indefinitely. The business environment is constantly changing and new [[threat (computer)|threats]] and [[vulnerability (computing)|vulnerabilities]] emerge every day. Second, the choice of [[countermeasure (computer)|countermeasures]] ([[security controls|controls]]) used to manage risks must strike a balance between productivity, cost, effectiveness of the countermeasure, and the value of the informational asset being protected.

''[[Risk management]] is the process that allows IT managers to balance the operational and economic costs of protective measures and achieve gains in mission capability by protecting the IT systems and data that support their organizations’ missions. This process is not unique to the IT environment; indeed it pervades decision-making in all areas of our daily lives''.&lt;ref name=SP80030/&gt;

The head of an organizational unit must ensure that the organization has the capabilities needed to accomplish its mission. These mission owners must determine the security capabilities that their IT systems must have to provide the desired level of mission support in the face of real world [[threat (computer)|threat]]s. Most organizations have tight budgets for IT security; therefore, IT security spending must be reviewed as thoroughly as other management decisions. A well-structured risk management methodology, when used effectively, can help management identify appropriate [[security controls|controls]] for providing the mission-essential security capabilities.&lt;ref name=SP80030/&gt;
[[File:Osa metamodel v003.png|thumb|Relationships between IT security entity]]

Risk management in the IT world is quite a complex, multi faced activity, with a lot of relations with other complex activities. The picture to the right shows the relationships between different related terms.

The American [[National Information Assurance Training and Education Center]] defines risk management in the IT field as:&lt;ref name="NIATEC Glossary of terms"&gt;[http://niatec.info/Glossary.aspx?term=4253&amp;alpha=R NIATEC Glossary of terms]&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''The total process to identify, control, and minimize the impact of uncertain events. The objective of the risk management program is to reduce risk and obtain and maintain DAA approval. The process facilitates the management of security risks by each level of management throughout the system life cycle. The approval process consists of three elements: [[Risk analysis (engineering)|risk analysis]], certification, and approval.''
# ''An element of managerial science concerned with the identification, measurement, control, and minimization of uncertain events. An effective risk management program encompasses the following four phases:''
##a ''Risk assessment, as derived from an evaluation of threats and vulnerabilities.''
## ''Management decision.''
## ''Control implementation.''
## ''Effectiveness review.''
# ''The total process of identifying, measuring, and minimizing uncertain events affecting AIS resources. It includes [[Risk analysis (engineering)|risk analysis]], cost benefit analysis, safeguard selection, security test and evaluation, safeguard implementation, and systems review.''
# ''The total process of identifying, controlling, and eliminating or minimizing uncertain events that may affect system resources. lt includes risk analysis, cost benefit analysis, selection, implementation and test, security evaluation of safeguards, and overall security review.''

== Risk management as part of enterprise risk management ==
Some organizations have, and many others should have, a comprehensive [[Enterprise risk management]] (ERM) in place. The four objective categories addressed, according to [[Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission]] (COSO) are:
* Strategy - high-level goals, aligned with and supporting the organization's mission
* Operations - effective and efficient use of resources
* Financial Reporting - reliability of operational and financial reporting
* Compliance - compliance with applicable laws and regulations
According to the [[Risk IT]] framework by [[ISACA]],&lt;ref name=riskit&gt;The Risk IT Framework by ISACA, {{ISBN|978-1-60420-111-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; IT risk is transversal to all four categories. The IT risk should be managed in the framework of Enterprise risk management: [[Risk appetite]] and Risk sensitivity of the whole enterprise should guide the IT risk management process. ERM should provide the context and business objectives to IT risk management

== Risk management methodology ==
[[File:The Risk Management Process.png|thumb|ENISA: The Risk Management Process, according to ISO Standard 13335]]
The term [[methodology]] means an organized set of principles and rules that drive action in a particular field of knowledge.&lt;ref name=Vacca1/&gt;
A methodology does not describe specific methods; nevertheless it does specify several processes that need to be followed. These processes constitute a generic framework. They may be broken down in sub-processes, they may be combined, or their sequence may change. However, any risk management exercise must carry out these processes in one form or another, The following table compares the processes foreseen by three leading standards.&lt;ref name=Vacca1/&gt; The [[ISACA]] [[Risk IT]] framework is more recent. The Risk IT Practitioner-Guide&lt;ref name=RISKITP&gt;[http://www.isaca.org/Knowledge-Center/Research/ResearchDeliverables/Pages/The-Risk-IT-Practitioner-Guide.aspx The Risk IT Practitioner Guide, Appendix 3 ISACA] {{ISBN|978-1-60420-116-1}} (registration required)&lt;/ref&gt; compares Risk IT and ISO 27005.
The overall comparison is illustrated in the following table.

Due to the probabilistic nature and the need of cost benefit analysis, IT risks are managed following a process that according to [[NIST]] SP 800-30 can be divided in the following steps:&lt;ref name=SP80030/&gt;
# [[risk assessment]],
# [[#Risk mitigation|risk mitigation]], and
# [[evaluation]] and [[wikt:assessment|assessment]].

Effective risk management must be totally integrated into the [[Systems Development Life Cycle]].&lt;ref name=SP80030/&gt;

Information [[Risk analysis (engineering)|risk analysis]] conducted on applications, computer installations, networks and systems under development should be undertaken using structured methodologies.&lt;ref name=SOGP&gt;[https://www.isfsecuritystandard.com Standard of Good Practice by Information Security Forum (ISF) Section SM3.4 Information risk analysis methodologies]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Context establishment ==
This step is the first step in [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] [[ISO/IEC 27005]] framework. Most of the elementary activities are foreseen as the first sub process of Risk assessment according to [[NIST]] SP 800-30.
This step implies the acquisition of all relevant information about the organization and the determination of the basic criteria, purpose, scope and boundaries of risk management activities and the organization in charge of risk management activities. The purpose is usually the compliance with legal requirements and provide evidence of due diligence supporting an [[Information security management system|ISMS]] that can be certified. The scope can be an incident reporting plan, a [[business continuity plan]].

Another area of application can be the certification of a product.

Criteria include the risk evaluation, risk acceptance and impact evaluation criteria. These are conditioned by:&lt;ref name=ISO27005&gt;ISO/IEC, "Information technology -- Security techniques-Information security risk management" ISO/IEC FIDIS 27005:2008&lt;/ref&gt;
* legal and regulatory requirements
* the strategic value for the business of information processes
* [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]] expectations
* negative consequences for the reputation of the organization

Establishing the scope and boundaries, the organization should be studied: its mission, its values, its structure; its strategy, its locations and cultural environment. The constraints (budgetary, cultural, political, technical) of the organization are to be collected and documented as guide for next steps.

=== Organization for security management ===
The set up of the organization in charge of risk management is foreseen as partially fulfilling the requirement to provide the resources needed to establish, implement, operate, monitor, review, maintain and improve an ISMS.&lt;ref name=ISO27001&gt;ISO/IEC 27001&lt;/ref&gt; The main roles inside this organization are:&lt;ref name=SP80030/&gt;
* Senior Management
* [[Chief information officer]] (CIO)
* System and Information owners
* the business and functional managers
* the [[ISSO (IT)|Information System Security Officer]] (ISSO) or [[Chief information security officer]] (CISO)
* IT Security Practitioners
* Security Awareness Trainers

== Risk assessment ==
[[File:Octave like.jpg|thumb|ENISA: Risk assessment inside risk management]]
Risk Management is a recurrent activity that deals with the analysis, planning, implementation, control and monitoring of implemented measurements and the enforced security policy. On the contrary, Risk Assessment is executed at discrete time points (e.g. once a year, on demand, etc.) and – until the performance of the next assessment - provides a temporary view of assessed risks and while parameterizing the entire Risk Management process.
This view of the relationship of Risk Management to Risk Assessment is depicted in figure as adopted from OCTAVE.&lt;ref name=ENISAFULL/&gt;

Risk assessment is often conducted in more than one iteration, the first being a high-level assessment to identify high risks, while the other iterations detailed the analysis of the major risks and other risks.

According to [[National Information Assurance Training and Education Center]] risk assessment in the IT field is:&lt;ref name="NIATEC Glossary of terms"/&gt;
# ''A study of the vulnerabilities, threats, likelihood, loss or impact, and theoretical effectiveness of security measures. Managers use the results of a risk assessment to develop security requirements and specifications.''
# ''The process of evaluating threats and vulnerabilities, known and postulated, to determine expected loss and establish the degree of acceptability to system operations.''
# ''An identification of a specific ADP facility's assets, the threats to these assets, and the ADP facility's vulnerability to those threats.''
# An analysis of system assets and vulnerabilities to establish an expected loss from certain events based on estimated probabilities of the occurrence of those events. The purpose of a risk assessment is to determine if countermeasures are adequate to reduce the probability of loss or the impact of loss to an acceptable level. ''
#''A management tool which provides a systematic approach for determining the relative value and sensitivity of computer installation assets, assessing vulnerabilities, assessing loss expectancy or perceived risk exposure levels, assessing existing protection features and additional protection alternatives or acceptance of risks and documenting management decisions. Decisions for implementing additional protection features are normally based on the existence of a reasonable ratio between cost/benefit of the safeguard and sensitivity/value of the assets to be protected. Risk assessments may vary from an informal review of a small scale microcomputer installation to a more formal and fully documented analysis (i. e., risk analysis) of a large scale computer installation. Risk assessment methodologies may vary from qualitative or quantitative approaches to any combination of these two approaches.''

=== ISO 27005 framework ===
Risk assessment receives as input the output of the previous step [[#Context establishment|Context establishment]]; the output is the list of assessed risks prioritized according to risk evaluation criteria.
The process can be divided into the following steps:&lt;ref name=ISO27005/&gt;
* [[Risk analysis (engineering)|Risk analysis]], further divided in:
** [[#Risk identification|Risk identification]]
** [[#Risk estimation|Risk estimation]]
** [[#Risk evaluation|Risk evaluation]]
The following table compares these ISO 27005 processes with [[Risk IT]] framework processes:&lt;ref name=RISKITP/&gt;

The [[ISO/IEC 17799|ISO/IEC 27002:2005]] Code of practice for information security management recommends the following be examined during a risk assessment:
*[[security policy]],
*[[organization]] of information security,
*[[asset management]],
*[[human resources]] security,
* [[physical security|physical]] and [[environmental security]],
*[[communications]] and operations management,
*[[access control]],
*information systems acquisition, development and maintenance, (see [[Systems Development Life Cycle]])
*information security [[incident management]],
* [[business continuity]] management, and
* [[regulatory compliance]].

==== Risk identification ====
[[File:2010-T10-ArchitectureDiagram.png|thumb|300px|OWASP: relationship between threat agent and business impact]]
Risk identification states what could cause a potential loss; the following are to be identified:&lt;ref name=ISO27005/&gt;
* [[asset (computing)|assets]], primary (i.e. Business processes and related information) and supporting (i.e. hardware, software, personnel, site, organization structure)
* [[Threat (computer)|threat]]s
* existing and planned security measures
* vulnerabilities
* consequence
* related business processes
The output of sub process is made up of:

* list of asset and related business processes to be risk managed with associated list of threats, existing and planned security measures
* list of vulnerabilities unrelated to any identified threats
* list of incident scenarios with their consequences.

==== Risk estimation ====
There are two methods of risk assessment in information security field, [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] and [[Qualitative research|qualitative]].&lt;ref name="CISSP-Guide"&gt;{{cite book | title=Official (ISC)2 Guide to CISSP CBK | publisher=Auerbach Publications | year=2007 | pages=1065 | location=Risk Management}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Purely quantitative risk assessment is a mathematical calculation based on security metrics on the [[asset (computing)|asset]] (system or application).
For each [[risk scenario]], taking into consideration the different [[risk factor (computing)|risk factors]] a [[Single loss expectancy]] (SLE) is determined. Then, considering the probability of occurrence on a given period basis, for example the annual rate of occurrence (ARO), the [[Annualized Loss Expectancy]] is determined as the product of ARO X SLE.&lt;ref name="Vacca"/&gt;
It is important to point out that the values of [[asset (computing)|assets]] to be considered are those of all involved assets, not only the value of the directly affected resource.&lt;br /&gt;
For example, if you consider the risk scenario of a Laptop theft threat, you should consider the value of the data (a related asset) contained in the computer and the reputation and liability of the company (other assets) deriving from the lost of availability and confidentiality of the data that could be involved.
It is easy to understand that [[intangible asset]]s (data, reputation, liability) can be worth much more than physical resources at risk (the laptop hardware in the example).&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.cnn.com/2009-01-27/politics/va.data.theft_1_laptop-personal-data-single-veteran?_s=PM:POLITICS CNN article about a class action settlement for a Veteran Affair stolen laptop]&lt;/ref&gt;
Intangible asset value can be huge, but is not easy to evaluate: this can be a consideration against a pure quantitative approach.&lt;ref name=FAIR/&gt;

Qualitative risk assessment (three to five steps evaluation, from Very High to Low) is performed when the organization requires a risk assessment be performed in a relatively short time or to meet a small budget, a significant quantity of relevant data is not available, or the persons performing the assessment don't have the sophisticated mathematical, financial, and risk assessment expertise required.&lt;ref name="CISSP-Guide" /&gt; Qualitative risk assessment can be performed in a shorter period of time and with less data. Qualitative risk assessments are typically performed through interviews of a sample of personnel from all relevant groups within an organization charged with the security of the asset being assessed. Qualitative risk assessments are descriptive versus measurable.
Usually a qualitative classification is done followed by a quantitative evaluation of the highest risks to be compared to the costs of security measures.

Risk estimation has as input the output of risk analysis and can be split in the following steps:
* assessment of the consequences through the valuation of assets
* assessment of the likelihood of the incident (through threat and vulnerability valuation)
* assign values to the likelihood and consequence of the risks
The output is the list of risks with value levels assigned. It can be documented in a [[risk register]].

Risks arising from security threats and adversary attacks may be particularly difficult to estimate. This difficulty is made worse because, at least for any IT system connected to the Internet, any adversary with intent and capability may attack because physical closeness or access is not necessary. Some initial models have been proposed for this problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Global adversarial capability modeling|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/icp.jsp?arnumber=7120797|journal = 2015 APWG Symposium on Electronic Crime Research (eCrime)|date = 2015-05-01|pages = 1–21|doi = 10.1109/ECRIME.2015.7120797|first = J.|last = Spring|first2 = S.|last2 = Kern|first3 = A.|last3 = Summers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During risk estimation there are generally three values of a given asset, one for the loss of one of the [[CIA triad|CIA]] properties: [[Information security|Confidentiality]], Integrity, [[Availability]].&lt;ref name="BS7799"&gt;British Standard Institute "ISMSs-Part 3: Guidelines for information security risk management" BS 7799-3:2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Risk evaluation ====
The risk evaluation process receives as input the output of risk analysis process. It compares each risk level against the risk acceptance criteria and prioritise the risk list with risk treatment indications.

=== NIST SP 800 30 framework ===
[[File:NIST SP 800-30 Figure 3-1.png|thumb|Risk assessment according NIST SP 800-30 Figure 3-1]]
To determine the likelihood of a future adverse event, [[threat (computer)|threat]]s to an IT system must be in conjunction with the potential [[Vulnerability (computing)|vulnerabilities]] and the [[security controls|controls]] in place for the IT system.&lt;br /&gt;
Impact refers to the magnitude of harm that could be caused by a threat’s exercise of vulnerability. The level of impact is governed by the potential mission impacts and produces a relative value for the IT assets and resources affected (e.g., the criticality sensitivity of the IT system components and data). The risk assessment methodology encompasses nine primary steps:&lt;ref name=SP80030&gt;[http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-30/sp800-30.pdf NIST SP 800-30 Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Step 1 System Characterization
* Step 2 Threat Identification
* Step 3 Vulnerability Identification
* Step 4 Control Analysis
* Step 5 Likelihood Determination
* Step 6 Impact Analysis
* Step 7 Risk Determination
* Step 8 Control Recommendations
* Step 9 Results Documentation

== Risk mitigation ==
Risk mitigation, the second process according to SP 800-30, the third according to ISO 27005 of risk management, involves prioritizing, evaluating, and implementing the appropriate risk-reducing controls recommended from the risk assessment process.
Because the elimination of all risk is usually impractical or close to impossible, it is the responsibility of senior management and functional and business managers to use the least-cost approach and implement the most appropriate controls to decrease mission risk to an acceptable level, with minimal adverse impact on the organization’s resources and mission.

=== ISO 27005 framework ===
The risk treatment process aim at selecting security measures to:
* reduce
* retain
* avoid
* transfer
risk and produce a risk treatment plan, that is the output of the process with the residual risks subject to the acceptance of management.

There are some list to select appropriate security measures,&lt;ref name=ISO27001/&gt; but is up to the single organization to choose the most appropriate one according to its business strategy, constraints of the environment and circumstances. The choice should be rational and documented. The importance of accepting a risk that is too costly to reduce is very high and led to the fact that risk acceptance is considered a separate process.&lt;ref name=ISO27005/&gt;

Risk transfer apply were the risk has a very high impact but is not easy to reduce significantly the likelihood by means of security controls: the [[insurance]] premium should be compared against the mitigation costs, eventually evaluating some mixed strategy to partially treat the risk. Another option is to outsource the risk to somebody more efficient to manage the risk.&lt;ref&gt;Costas Lambrinoudakisa, Stefanos Gritzalisa, Petros Hatzopoulosb, Athanasios N. Yannacopoulosb, Sokratis Katsikasa, "A formal model for pricing information systems insurance contracts", Computer Standards &amp; Interfaces - Volume 27, Issue 5, June 2005, Pages 521-532 {{doi|10.1016/j.csi.2005.01.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Risk avoidance describe any action where ways of conducting business are changed to avoid any risk occurrence. For example, the choice of not storing sensitive information about customers can be an avoidance for the risk that customer data can be stolen.

The ''residual risks'', i.e. the risk remaining after risk treatment decision have been taken, should be estimated to ensure that sufficient protection is achieved. If the residual risk is unacceptable, the risk treatment process should be iterated.

=== NIST SP 800 30 framework ===
[[File:NIST SP 800-30 Figure 4-2.png|thumb|Risk mitigation methodology flow chart from NIST SP 800-30 Figure 4-2]]
[[File:NIST SP 800-30 Figure 4-1.png|thumb|Risk mitigation action point according to NIST SP 800-30 Figure 4-1]]
Risk mitigation is a systematic methodology used by senior management to reduce mission risk.&lt;ref name=SP80030/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Risk mitigation can be achieved through any of the following risk mitigation options:
* '''Risk Assumption'''. To accept the potential risk and continue operating the IT system or to implement controls to lower the risk to an acceptable level
* '''Risk Avoidance'''. To avoid the risk by eliminating the risk cause and/or consequence (e.g., forgo certain functions of the system or shut down the system when risks are identified)
* '''Risk Limitation'''. To limit the risk by implementing controls that minimize the adverse impact of a threat’s exercising a vulnerability (e.g., use of supporting, preventive, detective controls)
* '''Risk Planning'''. To manage risk by developing a risk mitigation plan that prioritizes, implements, and maintains controls
* ''' Research and Acknowledgement'''. To lower the risk of loss by acknowledging the vulnerability or flaw and researching controls to correct the vulnerability
* '''Risk Transference'''. To transfer the risk by using other options to compensate for the loss, such as purchasing insurance.
Address the greatest risks and strive for sufficient risk mitigation at the lowest cost, with minimal impact on other mission capabilities: this is the suggestion contained in&lt;ref name=SP80030/&gt;

== Risk communication ==
{{main article|Risk_management#Risk_communication}}
Risk communication is a horizontal process that interacts bidirectionally with all other processes of risk management. Its purpose is to establish a common understanding of all aspect of risk among all the organization's stakeholder. Establishing a common understanding is important, since it influences decisions to be taken. The Risk Reduction Overview method &lt;ref&gt;[http://rro.sourceforge.net RRO website]&lt;/ref&gt; is specifically designed for this process. It presents a comprehensible overview of the coherence of risks, measures and residual risks to achieve this common understanding.

== Risk monitoring and review ==
Risk management is an ongoing, never ending process. Within this process implemented security measures are regularly monitored and reviewed to ensure that they work as planned and that changes in the environment rendered them ineffective. Business requirements, vulnerabilities and threats can change over the time.

Regular audits should be scheduled and should be conducted by an independent party, i.e. somebody not under the control of whom is responsible for the implementations or daily management of [[Information security management system|ISMS]].

== IT evaluation and assessment ==
Security controls should be validated. Technical controls are possible complex systems that are to tested and verified. The hardest part to validate is people knowledge of procedural controls and the effectiveness of the real application in daily business of the security procedures.&lt;ref name=SP80030/&gt;

[[Vulnerability assessment (computing)|Vulnerability assessment]], both internal and external, and [[Penetration test]] are instruments for verifying the status of security controls.

[[Information technology security audit]] is an organizational and procedural control with the aim of evaluating security.
The IT systems of most organization are evolving quite rapidly. Risk management should cope with these changes through change authorization after risk re evaluation of the affected systems and processes and periodically review the risks and mitigation actions.&lt;ref name=Vacca/&gt;

Monitoring system events according to a security monitoring strategy, an incident response plan and security validation and metrics are fundamental activities to assure that an optimal level of security is obtained.&lt;br /&gt;
It is important to monitor the new vulnerabilities, apply procedural and technical security controls like regularly [[Patch (computing)|updating software]], and evaluate other kinds of controls to deal with [[zero-day attack]]s.

The attitude of involved people to [[benchmarking|benchmark]] against [[best practice]] and follow the seminars of [[professional association]]s in the sector are factors to assure the state of art of an organization IT risk management practice.

== Integrating risk management into system development life cycle ==
Effective risk management must be totally integrated into the [[Systems Development Life Cycle|SDLC]]. An IT system’s SDLC has five phases: initiation, development or acquisition, implementation, operation or maintenance, and disposal. The risk management methodology is the same regardless of the SDLC phase for which the assessment is being conducted. Risk management is an iterative process that can be performed during each major phase of the SDLC.&lt;ref name=SP80030/&gt;
{|class="wikitable"
|+ align="center" |'''Table 2-1 Integration of Risk Management into the SDLC'''&lt;ref name=SP80030/&gt;
|-
! SDLC Phases!!Phase Characteristics!!Support from Risk Management Activities
|-
| Phase 1: Initiation||The need for an IT system is expressed and the purpose and scope of the IT system is documented||Identified risks are used to support the development of the system requirements, including security requirements, and a security concept of operations (strategy)
|-
| style=white-space:nowrap| Phase 2: Development or Acquisition||The IT system is designed, purchased, programmed, developed, or otherwise constructed||The risks identified during this phase can be used to support the security analyses of the IT system that may lead to architecture and design tradeoffs during system development
|-
| Phase 3: Implementation||The system security features should be configured, enabled, tested, and verified||The risk management process supports the assessment of the system implementation against its requirements and within its modeled operational environment. Decisions regarding risks identified must be made prior to system operation
|-
| style=white-space:nowrap|Phase 4: Operation or Maintenance||The system performs its functions. Typically the system is being modified on an ongoing basis through the addition of hardware and software and by changes to organizational processes, policies, and procedures||Risk management activities are performed for periodic system reauthorization (or reaccreditation) or whenever major changes are made to an IT system in its operational, production environment (e.g., new system interfaces)
|-
| Phase 5: Disposal||This phase may involve the disposition of information, hardware, and software. Activities may include moving, archiving, discarding, or destroying information and sanitizing the hardware and software||Risk management activities are performed for system components that will be disposed of or replaced to ensure that the hardware and software are properly disposed of, that residual data is appropriately handled, and that system migration is conducted in a secure and systematic manner

[[NIST]] SP 800-64&lt;ref name=NIST80064&gt;[http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-64-Rev2/SP800-64-Revision2.pdf 800-64 NIST Security Considerations in the Information System Development Life Cycle]&lt;/ref&gt; is devoted to this topic.

Early integration of security in the SDLC enables agencies to maximize return on investment in their security programs, through:&lt;ref name=NIST80064/&gt;
* Early identification and mitigation of security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, resulting in lower cost of security control implementation and vulnerability mitigation;
* Awareness of potential engineering challenges caused by mandatory security controls;
* Identification of shared [[Security service (telecommunication)|security services]] and reuse of security strategies and tools to reduce development cost and schedule while improving security posture through proven methods and techniques; and
* Facilitation of informed executive decision making through comprehensive risk management in a timely manner.
This guide&lt;ref name=NIST80064/&gt; focuses on the information security components of the SDLC. First, descriptions of the key security roles and responsibilities that are needed in most information system developments are provided. Second, sufficient information about the SDLC is provided to allow a person who is unfamiliar with the SDLC process to understand the relationship between information security and the SDLC.
The document integrates the security steps into the linear, sequential (a.k.a. waterfall) SDLC. The five-step SDLC cited in the document is an example of one method of development and is not intended to mandate this methodology.
Lastly, SP 800-64 provides insight into IT projects and initiatives that are not as clearly defined as SDLC-based developments, such as service-oriented architectures, cross-organization projects, and IT facility developments.

Security can be incorporated into information systems acquisition, development and maintenance by implementing effective security practices in the following areas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wiki.internet2.edu/confluence/display/itsg2/Information+Systems+Acquisition%2C+Development%2C+and+Maintenance+%28ISO+12%29 EDUCAUSE Dashboard ISO 12]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Security requirements for information systems
* Correct processing in applications
* Cryptographic controls
* Security of system files
* Security in development and support processes
* Technical vulnerability management

Information systems security begins with incorporating security into the requirements process for any new application or system enhancement. Security should be designed into the system from the beginning. Security requirements are presented to the vendor during the requirements phase of a product purchase. Formal testing should be done to determine whether the product meets the required security specifications prior to purchasing the product.

Correct processing in applications is essential in order to prevent errors and to mitigate loss, unauthorized modification or misuse of information. Effective coding techniques include validating input and output data, protecting message integrity using encryption, checking for processing errors, and creating activity logs.

Applied properly, cryptographic controls provide effective mechanisms for protecting the confidentiality, authenticity and integrity of information. An institution should develop policies on the use of encryption, including proper key management. Disk Encryption is one way to protect data at rest. Data in transit can be protected from alteration and unauthorized viewing using SSL certificates issued through a Certificate Authority that has implemented a Public Key Infrastructure.

System files used by applications must be protected in order to ensure the integrity and stability of the application. Using source code repositories with version control, extensive testing, production back-off plans, and appropriate access to program code are some effective measures that can be used to protect an application's files.

Security in development and support processes is an essential part of a comprehensive quality assurance and production control process, and would usually involve training and continuous oversight by the most experienced staff.

Applications need to be monitored and patched for technical vulnerabilities. Procedures for applying patches should include evaluating the patches to determine their appropriateness, and whether or not they can be successfully removed in case of a negative impact.

== Critique of risk management as a methodology ==
Risk management as a scientific methodology has been criticized as being shallow.&lt;ref name=Vacca1/&gt; Major IT risk management programmes for large organizations, such as mandated by the US [[FISMA#Critique|Federal Information Security Management Act]], have been criticized.

By avoiding the complexity that accompanies the formal probabilistic model of risks and uncertainty, risk management looks more like a process that attempts to guess rather than formally predict the future on the basis of statistical evidence. It is highly subjective in assessing the value of assets, the likelihood of threats occurrence and the significance of the impact.

However, a better way to deal with the subject has not emerged.&lt;ref name=Vacca1/&gt;

== Risk managements methods ==

It is quite hard to list most of the methods that at least partially support the IT risk management process. Efforts in this direction were done by:
* [[NIST]] Description of Automated Risk Management Packages That NIST/NCSC Risk Management Research Laboratory Has Examined, updated 1991
* [[ENISA]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enisa.europa.eu/act/rm/cr/risk-management-inventory/rm-ra-methods ENISA, Inventory of Risk Management / Risk Assessment Methods]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2006; a list of methods and tools is available on line with a comparison engine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rm-inv.enisa.europa.eu/rm_ra_methods.html Inventory of Risk Management / Risk Assessment Methods]&lt;/ref&gt; Among them the most widely used are:&lt;ref name=Vacca1/&gt;
** [[CRAMM]] Developed by British government is compliant to [[ISO/IEC 17799]], [[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act]] (GLBA) and [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] (HIPAA)
** [[EBIOS]] developed by the French government it is compliant with major security standards: [[ISO/IEC 27001]], ISO/IEC 13335, [[ISO/IEC 15408]], [[ISO/IEC 17799]] and ISO/IEC 21287
** [[Standard of Good Practice]] developed by [[Information Security Forum]] (ISF)
** [[Mehari]] developed by [https://www.clusif.asso.fr/ Clusif Club de la Sécurité de l'Information Français]
** TIK IT Risk Framework developed by [http://itriskinstitute.com/ IT Risk Institute]
** Octave developed by Carnegie Mellon University, SEI ([[Software Engineering Institute]]) The Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability EvaluationSM (OCTAVE) approach defines a risk-based strategic assessment and planning technique for security.
** [[IT Baseline Protection Catalogs|IT-Grundschutz]] (IT Baseline Protection Manual) developed by Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) (Germany); IT-Grundschutz provides a method for an organization to establish an Information Security Management System (ISMS). It comprises both generic IT security recommendations for establishing an applicable IT security process and detailed technical recommendations to achieve the necessary IT security level for a specific domain
Enisa report&lt;ref name=ENISAFULL/&gt; classified the different methods regarding completeness, free availability, tool support; the result is that:
* EBIOS, ISF methods, IT-Grundschutz cover deeply all the aspects (Risk Identification, Risk analysis, Risk evaluation, Risk assessment, Risk treatment, Risk acceptance, Risk communication),
* EBIOS and IT-Grundschutz are the only ones freely available and
* only EBIOS has an open source tool to support it.

The [[Factor Analysis of Information Risk]] (FAIR) main document, "An Introduction to Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR)", Risk Management Insight LLC, November 2006;&lt;ref name=FAIR&gt;,[http://www.riskmanagementinsight.com/media/docs/FAIR_introduction.pdf "An Introduction to Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR)", Risk Management Insight LLC, November 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141118061526/http://www.riskmanagementinsight.com/media/docs/FAIR_introduction.pdf |date=2014-11-18 }};&lt;/ref&gt;
outline that most of the methods above lack of rigorous definition of risk and its factors. FAIR is not another methodology to deal with risk management, but it complements existing methodologies.&lt;ref name=OGC081&gt;Technical Standard Risk Taxonomy {{ISBN|1-931624-77-1}} Document Number: C081 Published by The Open Group, January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

FAIR has had a good acceptance, mainly by [[The Open Group]] and [[ISACA]].

ISACA developed a methodology, called [[Risk IT]], to address various kind of IT related risks, chiefly security related risks. It is integrated with [[COBIT]], a general framework to manage IT.
Risk IT has a broader concept of [[IT risk]] than other methodologies, it encompasses not just only the negative [[impact (security)|impact]] of operations and service delivery which can bring destruction or reduction of the value of the organization, but also the benefit\value enabling risk associated to missing opportunities to use technology to enable or enhance business or the IT project management for aspects like overspending or late delivery with adverse business impact.&lt;ref name=RISKITW/&gt;

The "''Build Security In''" initiative of [[Homeland Security Department]] of United States, cites FAIR.&lt;ref&gt;https://buildsecurityin.us-cert.gov/bsi/articles/best-practices/deployment/583-BSI.html&lt;/ref&gt;
The initiative Build Security In is a collaborative effort that provides practices, tools, guidelines, rules, principles, and other resources that software developers, architects, and security practitioners can use to build security into software in every phase of its development. So it chiefly address [[Secure coding]].

In 2016, Threat Sketch launched an abbreviated cyber security risk assessment specifically for small organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hub.innovationquarter.com/2016/10/05/a-start-up-grows-up-in-the-innovation-quarter/|title=Threat Sketch: A Start-up Grows Up in the Innovation Quarter|date=2016-10-05|website=Innovation Quarter Hub|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.twcnews.com/nc/triad/news/2016/11/11/entrepreneurs-share-business-ideas-on-startup-weekend.html|title=Triad Entrepreneurs Share Business Ideas on Startup Weekend|newspaper=TWC News|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The methodology uses [[Real options valuation|real options]] to forecast and prioritize a fixed list of high-level threats.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14950">The '''Industrious Revolution''' is the title given to a period of time, usually given as between 1600 and 1800&lt;ref name="Clark1998p841"&gt;Clark &amp; Van Der Werf (1998), p. 841.&lt;/ref&gt; that led up to the [[Industrial Revolution]].  It is a term first coined by the Japanese demographic historian [[Akira Hayami]] &lt;small&gt;([[:ja:速水融|速水融]])&lt;/small&gt;,&lt;ref name="DeVries2008p78"&gt;De Vries (2008), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; and accepted by other historians to help further explain the advent of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Much of this theory deals with the spending behaviours of families in the period.  It also deals with the production and consumption of goods.  In fact, Industrious Revolutions are often characterized by a rise in demand for "market-supplied goods",&lt;ref name="DeVries1994p265"&gt;De Vries (1994), p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt; which will minimize the value of domestic goods, before the ultimate consumption. Industrious Revolutions often occur during a period where labour wages have stagnated or decreased.&lt;ref name="DeVries1994p265" /&gt;  The theory of a pre-industrial Industrious Revolution is contested within the history community.

== Origin ==
Hayami introduced the concept of Industrious Revolution in a Japanese-language work published in 1967. It was coined to compare the labour-intensive technologies of Tokugawa Japan (1603-1868) with the capital-intensive technologies of Britain's Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Industrious Revolution: Consumer Behavior and the Household Economy, 1650 to the Present|last=de Vries|first=Jan|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2008|isbn=9780521895026|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hayami observed that the two countries took different paths due to the different mix of factor endowments (capital for Britain and labour for Japan). He introduced Industrious Revolution to describe the Japanese developmental trajectory, which - lacking the British capital - exploited the benefits of increasing labour absorption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Resurgence of East Asia: 500, 150 and 50 Year Perspectives|last=Arrighi|first=Giovanni|last2=Hamashita|first2=Takeshi|last3=Selden|first3=Mark|publisher=Routledge|year=2003|isbn=978-0415316361|location=London|pages=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Industrious vs. Industrial Revolution ==
This proposed Industrious Revolution does not aim to replace the [[Industrial Revolution]] in history; rather it is designed to supplement it.  By revamping the history of the period directly preceding the [[Industrial Revolution]], some historians hope to ensure that people get a better understanding of a particular aspect of the [[Early Modern Period]].
	
The basic picture painted of the pre-Industrial Revolution is that the [[Industrial Revolution]] was the result of a surplus of money and crops, which led to the development of new technology.  This new technology eventually developed into factories.  The Industrious Revolution addresses this belief, saying instead, that the overwhelming desire for more goods directly preceded the Industrial Revolution. The theory states that during the Industrious Revolution there was an increase in demand for goods, but that supply did not rise as quickly.&lt;ref name="DeVries1994p255"&gt;De Vries (1994), p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Eventually, some achievements of industry and agriculture, as well as the decisions made by households, helped to increase the supply, as well as the demand for goods. These behaviours, when combined constitute an Industrious Revolution.&lt;ref name="DeVries1994p255" /&gt;  A quick summation of the differences between the Industrious Revolution and the [[Industrial Revolution]] is that the former is concerned with demand, and the latter is supply based.&lt;ref name="DeVries1994p256"&gt;De Vries (1994), p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt; The right mindset to a productional economy and world may have increased the supply of technology, but they would have had little impact on invention without a demand for new techniques. 
	
The theory of an Industrious Revolution, as put forward by historian Jan de Vries, claims that there were two parts to the Industrious Revolution.  First, there was a reduction of leisure time as the utility of monetary income rose.  Second, the focus of labour shifted from goods and services to marketable goods.&lt;ref name="DeVries1994p257"&gt;De Vries (1994), p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some within the field of [[cultural history]] have theorized that a further motive for an industrious revolution is a shift in the view on what it takes for an individual to be considered independent.  Independence was equated with land ownership prior to an industrious revolution.  Wage earners were granted a degraded and dependent status.  Typically, as in the case of pre-industrial Great Britain and America, these dependent sorts were deemed unworthy of full citizenship rights.  Industrious revolutions shift the meaning of independence from land-holding to earning a competency.  A wage earner could now be considered independent if he/she earned enough money to support a household.  Hard work was viewed as essential for reaching this goal.

== Opposition ==
One of the suggested hallmarks of an Industrious Revolution is that of increased work days.  However, according to historians Gregory Clark and Ysbrand Van Der Werf, there has been no information found to suggest an increase in work days, in the time period between the [[Medieval]] Period and the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="Clark1998p839"&gt;Clark &amp; Van Der Werf (1998), p. 839.&lt;/ref&gt; These records even indicate that before 1750, some people were working three hundred days per year.&lt;ref name="Clark1998p836"&gt;Clark &amp; Van Der Werf (1998), p. 836.&lt;/ref&gt;  Even in the period preceding the [[Industrial Revolution]] people were working at least two hundred and ninety days in a year.&lt;ref name="Clark1998p837"&gt;Clark &amp; Van Der Werf (1998), p. 837.&lt;/ref&gt;  So, this information would demonstrate that there was very little increase in days worked.  Since increase in work loads is one of the suggested hallmarks of an Industrious Revolution, this would work against the theory.
	
Clark and Van Der Werf have also examined the output of a couple of English industries.  For one, they looked at records of the saw mills in England.  Between 1300 and 1800, the period directly preceding and following the proposed Industrious Revolution, the estimated amount of lumber sawed increased about eighty percent.&lt;ref name="Clark1998p835"&gt;Clark &amp; Van Der Werf (1998), p. 835.&lt;/ref&gt;    However, this increase in lumber sawed can be attributed to new technologies, and not in fact the influence of an Industrious Revolution.  In contrast, they mention the [[threshing]] industry.  Unlike the lumber sawing business, this industry shows “clear downward movement”&lt;ref name="Clark1998p834"&gt;Clark &amp; Van Der Werf (1998), p. 834.&lt;/ref&gt;  in [[threshing]] rates, after which there are no longer any trends.&lt;ref name="Clark1998p834" /&gt; This information would help to disprove the idea of an Industrious Revolution, since, as it has been put forth, there is no universal trend displaying an increase of work habits.

In a later work, Hayami cited that de Vries and other theorists' interpretations did not use the term in the same way he does. Hayami noted that these saw Industrious Revolution and Industrial Revolution as a continuum while the original idea considers the two revolutions as opposing concepts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Japan's Industrious Revolution: Economic and Social Transformations in the Early Modern Period|last=Hayami|first=Akira|publisher=Springer|year=2015|isbn=9784431551416|location=Tokyo|pages=95–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hayami also stressed that the term explained how the Japanese became industrious for some reason at one point and that eventually they will no longer be.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

== Production of goods ==
Prior the proposed era of the Industrious Revolution most goods were produced either by household or by [[guilds]].&lt;ref name="Wiesner-Hanks2006p202"&gt;Wiesner-Hanks (2006), p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; There were many households involved in the production of marketable goods.  Most of what was produced by these households were things that involved cloth- textiles, clothing, as well as art,&lt;ref name="Wiesner-Hanks2006p202" /&gt; and tapestries.&lt;ref name="Jardine1996p399"&gt;Jardine (1996), p. 399.&lt;/ref&gt;  These would be produced by the households, or by their respective [[guilds]].  It was even possible for [[guilds]] and merchants to outsource into more rural areas, to get some of the work done. These merchants would bring the raw materials to the workers, who would then, using the supplied materials, make the goods.&lt;ref name="Wiesner-Hanks2006p419"&gt;Wiesner-Hanks (2006), p. 419.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, young girls would be hired to make silk, because they were the only people believed to have hands dexterous enough to make the silk properly.&lt;ref name="Wiesner-Hanks2006p418"&gt;Wiesner-Hanks (2006), p. 418.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other occupations such as knitting, a job that was never organized into guilds, could easily be done within the household.&lt;ref name="Wiesner-Hanks2006"&gt;Wiesner-Hanks (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

The income of the household became dependent upon the quality and the quantity of everyone's work.&lt;ref name="DeVries1994"&gt;De Vries (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;  Even if people were not working for an individual [[guild]] they could still supply and make items not controlled by the [[guilds]]. These would be small, but necessary items like wooden dishes, or soaps.&lt;ref name="Wiesner-Hanks2006p205"&gt;Wiesner-Hanks (2006), p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; So, basically, much of production was done by, or for, [[guilds]]. This would indicate that much of what was done was not done for one individual household, but for a larger group or organization. 

Prior to the Industrious Revolution, the household was the major site of production, and could be comparable to a factory. However, things were to change a bit during the Industrious Revolution.  If the theory is to be believed, then there was a shift in the running of the household.  The everyday goods and products used by the household would slowly shift from mostly homemade, to mostly "commercially produced goods".&lt;ref name="DeVries1994p262"&gt;De Vries (1994), p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the women would be more than likely to be able to attain jobs outside of the household.&lt;ref name="DeVries1994p261-62"&gt;De Vries (1994), pp. 261–62.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is also seen within the context of the [[Industrial Revolution]], where women would often find small jobs to help supplement their husband's wages.&lt;ref&gt;Ross (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;  This would demonstrate the gradual movement away from the household as a centre of production.

==Patterns of consumption==
The patterns of consumption present in England at this time period were similar to what one might find in Europe, as well as in some of the Ottoman territories. This is unsurprising, however, since most of Europe and the Ottoman Empire were all connected through trade.&lt;ref name="DeVries1994p252"&gt;De Vries (1994), p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt;  Through these trade connections, people were able to buy many of the luxury goods that they desired.  Very common amongst the nobility was the idea of [[Conspicuous consumption]].  This can be traced back, even into the [[Middle Ages]].  People, the nobility especially, had trade connections throughout Europe, and many of them would use these connections to buy the works of art, etc. that they desired.&lt;ref name="Jardine1996"&gt;Jardine (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;  This does not extend only to the rich however: even [[Medieval]] peasants enjoyed imported luxury items; there is evidence to suggest that some English peasants drank imported French wine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Peasant |title=Medieval Lives |last=Jones |first=Terry |authorlink= |author2=Ereira, Alan |year=2005 |publisher=BBC Press |location=London |isbn=978-0-563-48793-7 |page=23 |chapter-url=}}{{Verify credibility|date=March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People were consuming products well before the Industrious Revolution. There were stock exchanges all over Europe, even London.&lt;ref name="Wiesner-Hanks2006" /&gt; People were also clearly making products for consumption, as the large number of guilds existing within Europe at that point would suggest.  What would cause the period between 1600 and 1800 to be labeled an Industrious Revolution, by looking at the patterns of consumption, is the rise in demand for these products.&lt;ref name="DeVries1994p255" /&gt; So, what would set this period in time apart would be more demands for luxury items.  Especially those items that could not be produced in the homes or by the [[guilds]].  During the proposed Industrious Revolution, this demand for luxury items would be greater than the supply could accommodate.&lt;ref name="DeVries1994" /&gt;  A rise in the rate at which people were consuming goods, especially when combined with other factors of the times, could have potentially heralded the Industrious Revolution.

The '''Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência (IGC)''' is an international centre for biological and [[biomedical research]] and graduate training based in Oeiras, Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=IGCiencia|title=IGC {{!}} A Special Place to Be|date=2014-05-21|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9y874pZeJw&amp;feature=youtu.be|accessdate=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded by the [[Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation]] (FCG) in 1961, and still supported by the Foundation, the IGC is organised in small independent research groups that work in an environment designed to encourage interactions with minimal hierarchical structure.

The scientific programme covers a wide range of domains and is at the interface of different disciplines. These include cell and [[developmental biology]], [[evolutionary biology]], [[immunology]] and [[host-pathogen interaction]], [[Botany|plant biology]], sociobiology, [[computational biology]] and [[biophysics]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.igc.gulbenkian.pt/pages/facilities.php/A=213___collection=article|title=IGC {{!}} Research {{!}} About IGC Research|website=www.igc.gulbenkian.pt|access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IGC has state-of-the-art facilities and services, constantly updated and ready to explore new scientific ideas. All resources are at the disposal of all IGC scientists equally, and common services and equipment are also open to external users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.igc.gulbenkian.pt/facilities/about|title=IGC {{!}} Serviços {{!}} Sobre Serviços IGC|last=|first=|date=|website=wwwpt.igc.gulbenkian.pt|language=pt|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IGC hosts a number of [[Postgraduate education|graduate education]] and training programmes. Since 1993 the IGC runs innovative [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD programmes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.igc.gulbenkian.pt/education/phdprogrammes|title=IGC {{!}} Education and Training {{!}} PhD Programmes|website=www.igc.gulbenkian.pt|language=pt|access-date=2018-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;, directed towards intellectual breadth, creativity and independent scientific thought. Also, the IGC has a strong tradition in promoting science in society with dedicated outreach programmes. 

Around 400 people, including 300 researchers (students, postdocs, technicians and group leaders), from 41 different countries work at the IGC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.igc.gulbenkian.pt/pages/facilities.php/A=121___collection=article|title=IGC {{!}} Facts and Figures|website=www.igc.gulbenkian.pt|language=pt|access-date=2018-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1998, 88 research groups have already settled in the institute. Of these, 44 went to other institutions, mainly other research centres and universities in Portugal.

In 1998, under the Directorship of [[António Coutinho]], the IGC was restructured into the current set-up and mode of action. Jonathan Howard succeeded Coutinho as Director of the IGC from October 2012 until January 2018. Since 1 February 2018, [[Mónica Bettencourt-Dias]] is the Director of the Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência.   

==History==
The establishment of the IGC was initiated in 1961 when the [[Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation]]’s board of trustees envisioned the creation of its own research centre to encourage multidisciplinary research, independent of universities, and without restrictions or prior interests. The original set up of the IGC included a Centre for Scientific Calculation (1962-1985), a Centre for Biology (1962), a centre for Pedagogical Innovation (1962-1980), a Centre for Agricultural Economy (1958-1986) and a Centre for Economy and Finances.  A new building alongside the Marquês de Pombal Palace, in Oeiras, was projected to make up the new campus planned with a set of infrastructures including laboratories, library, canteen and animal facility. In 1967, the Centre for Biology was officially inaugurated at the new Oeiras campus with four research groups in Cell Biology, Pharmacology, Microbiology and Physiology and around 20 researchers. From 1966 to 1969, four IGC leaders passed away: Delfim Santos (Pedagogical Innovation), António Gião (Scientific Calculation), Flávio Resende (Biology) and Luís Quartin Graça (Agricultural Economy).

In 1968 Luís Archer, jesuit priest and biologist, widely regarded as the ‘father' of molecular genetics in Portugal, returns to Portugal to set up the Molecular Genetics Laboratory at the IGC, in the Department of Cell Biology. The year after, in 1969, it was set up the ''Estudos Avançados de Oeiras'' (Oeiras Advanced Studies) to provide workshops, summer schools and international seminars to scientists.

In 1984, the [[Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation]]’s Board of Trustees decides that IGC will be a research centre exclusively dedicated to research and pos-graduated training in biology.

In 1989 the [http://www.itqb.unl.pt/ Instituto de Tecnologia Química e Biológica] (ITQB) and the [http://www.ibet.pt/ Instituto de Biologia Experimental e Tecnológica] (iBET) were created and hosted in the IGC campus. With IGC, they will later form the Oeiras Campus.

[[António Coutinho]], immunologist and Head of the Immunobiology Unit in [[Pasteur Institute|Institut Pasteur]], is appointed the Director of the Oeiras Advanced Studies in 1991. In 1993 Coutinho starts the Gulbenkian PhD Programme in Biology and Medicine (PGDBM), a pioneering programme in Portugal and one of the first of this kind in the world. In 1998, António Coutinho is designated Director of the IGC and starts a new phase of the institute as a ‘host institution' with the mission of identifying, educating and incubating new research leaders, providing access to facilities, and financial and intellectual autonomy to pursue research projects.

The Champalimaud Neuroscience Programme at the IGC is established in 2006 and the research groups of the newly formed [[Champalimaud Foundation]] are hosted at the IGC to carry out research in systems neuroscience until 2011, when they move to the Champalimaud Foundation’s new building in Lisbon.

In 2008, the IGC participates for the first time in the music festival [[NOS Alive]] under a partnership established between “Everything is New”, promoter of NOS Alive, and the IGC to support fellowships for young researchers.

==Research==

=== Main Accomplishments ===
- A study published in ''[[Nature Cell Biology]]'' in July 2018, coordinated by [[Mónica Bettencourt-Dias]], helped to better understand diseases that involve cells antennae, called [[Ciliopathy|ciliopathies]]. The researchers found that while cells use the same building materials for their antennae, they use them in different proportions and moments, thus creating the structurally different functions.This explains how their mutations, which occur in genetic diseases associated with [[Cilium|cilia]] (e.g. diseases leading to infertility, loss of vision, obesity), usually affect only some antennae, not all of them, and some patients show all of the symptoms, while others may have only one type of defect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jana|first=Swadhin Chandra|last2=Mendonça|first2=Susana|last3=Machado|first3=Pedro|last4=Werner|first4=Sascha|last5=Rocha|first5=Jaqueline|last6=Pereira|first6=António|last7=Maiato|first7=Helder|last8=Bettencourt-Dias|first8=Mónica|date=2018-07-16|title=Differential regulation of transition zone and centriole proteins contributes to ciliary base diversity|journal=Nature Cell Biology|language=En|volume=20|issue=8|pages=928–941|doi=10.1038/s41556-018-0132-1|pmid=30013109|issn=1465-7392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- The research team led by Joana Gonçalves-Sá and Luís Rocha showed that there is a specific mood associated with religious celebrations, a "loving mood" that can influence human reproductive behaviour. Using worldwide data from [[Twitter]] and [[Google Trends]] they found that culture, and not only biology, drives human reproductive cycles. The study was published in ''[[Scientific Reports]]'' in December 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wood|first=Ian B.|last2=Varela|first2=Pedro L.|last3=Bollen|first3=Johan|last4=Rocha|first4=Luis M.|last5=Gonçalves-Sá|first5=Joana|date=2017-12|title=Human Sexual Cycles are Driven by Culture and Match Collective Moods|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-18262-5|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=7|issue=1|pages=17973|doi=10.1038/s41598-017-18262-5|pmid=29269945|pmc=5740080|issn=2045-2322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- Ana Domingos and her group devoted to the study of the biological causes underlying obesity published a breakthrough study in ''[[Nature Medicine]]'' in October 2017. They discovered an unforeseen population of immune cells ([[macrophage]]s) associated with [[Sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic neurons]] in adipose tissue. These specialised macrophages are in direct contact with neurons and affect neuronal activation that is critical for fat mass reduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/10/171009123158.htm|title=Making fat mice lean: Novel immune cells control neurons responsible for fat breakdown|work=ScienceDaily|access-date=2018-08-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pirzgalska|first=Roksana M|last2=Seixas|first2=Elsa|last3=Seidman|first3=Jason S|last4=Link|first4=Verena M|last5=Sánchez|first5=Noelia Martínez|last6=Mahú|first6=Inês|last7=Mendes|first7=Raquel|last8=Gres|first8=Vitka|last9=Kubasova|first9=Nadiya|date=2017-10-09|title=Sympathetic neuron–associated macrophages contribute to obesity by importing and metabolizing norepinephrine|journal=Nature Medicine|language=En|volume=23|issue=11|pages=1309–1318|doi=10.1038/nm.4422|pmid=29035364|issn=1078-8956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- For many years biologists have wondered why plants have so many genes coding for proteins that are known to be essential for the nervous system of animals, called [[glutamate receptor]]s. A team led by Jose Feijó discovered a new function of these proteins, showing that moss sperm uses them to navigate towards the female organs and ensure offspring. The study was published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in July 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ortiz-Ramírez|first=Carlos|last2=Michard|first2=Erwan|last3=Simon|first3=Alexander A.|last4=Damineli|first4=Daniel S.

- Using experimental models of [[sepsis]] in mice, a research team led by Miguel Soares discovered an unsuspected mechanism that is protective against sepsis. The study was published in the scientific journal ''[[Cell (journal)|Cell]]'' in June 2017 and provided new avenues for therapeutic approaches against sepsis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weis|first=Sebastian|last2=Carlos|first2=Ana Rita|last3=Moita|first3=Maria Raquel|last4=Singh|first4=Sumnima|last5=Blankenhaus|first5=Birte|last6=Cardoso|first6=Silvia|last7=Larsen|first7=Rasmus|last8=Rebelo|first8=Sofia|last9=Schäuble|first9=Sascha|date=2017-06|title=Metabolic Adaptation Establishes Disease Tolerance to Sepsis|journal=Cell|volume=169|issue=7|pages=1263–1275.e14|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2017.05.031|issn=0092-8674|pmc=5480394|pmid=28622511}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- Moisés Mallo and his research group have discovered the key factor that regulates trunk [[Developmental biology|development]] in [[vertebrate]]s and explains why [[snake]]s have such a strikingly different body. These findings published in ''[[Developmental Cell]]'' in August 2016, contributed to understand the origin of the exceptionally long trunks that characterise the body of [[snake]]s and may open new avenues to the study of [[spinal cord]] [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aires|first=Rita|last2=Jurberg|first2=Arnon D.|last3=Leal|first3=Francisca|last4=Nóvoa|first4=Ana|last5=Cohn|first5=Martin J.|last6=Mallo|first6=Moisés|date=2016-08|title=Oct4 Is a Key Regulator of Vertebrate Trunk Length Diversity|journal=Developmental Cell|volume=38|issue=3|pages=262–274|doi=10.1016/j.devcel.2016.06.021|pmid=27453501|issn=1534-5807}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shylo|first=Natalia A.|last2=Weatherbee|first2=Scott D.|date=2016-08|title=Of Mice and Snakes: A Tail of Oct4|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1534580716305135|journal=Developmental Cell|volume=38|issue=3|pages=224–226|doi=10.1016/j.devcel.2016.07.020|pmid=27505413|issn=1534-5807}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- A research team led by [[Mónica Bettencourt-Dias|Mónica Bettencourt Dias]] shed light upon the critical mechanism of how [[oocyte]]s, the maternal gametes, lose [[centriole]]s and the importance of doing so for female fertility. The results published in the scientific journal [[Science (journal)|''Science'']] in May 2016 showed that [[centriole]]s normally have a coating that protects them which is lost inside the oocyte, eliminating therefore the centrioles. They further show that if the centrioles are not eliminated, those mothers are sterile.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pimenta-Marques|first=A.|last2=Bento|first2=I.|last3=Lopes|first3=C. a.

- IGC scientists led by Miguel Godinho Ferreira found that certain organs, such as the gut, start to age before other tissues because its cells have a "timekeeper" with a faster pace. The results published in the journal [[PLOS Genetics|''PLoS Genetics'']] in January 2016 also showed that monitoring the pace of these timekeepers can be a good indicator for the aging of the whole organism since the appearance of local age-related lesions anticipates the onset of age-associated diseases, such as cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carneiro|first=Madalena C.|last2=Henriques|first2=Catarina M.|last3=Nabais|first3=Joana|last4=Ferreira|first4=Tânia|last5=Carvalho|first5=Tânia|last6=Ferreira|first6=Miguel Godinho|date=2016-01-20|title=Short Telomeres in Key Tissues Initiate Local and Systemic Aging in Zebrafish|journal=PLOS Genetics|language=en|volume=12|issue=1|pages=e1005798|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005798|issn=1553-7404|pmc=4720274|pmid=26789415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- Research led by Raquel Oliveira, has elucidated how cells are almost blind to [[chromosome]] cohesion defects. The results published in ''[[Cell Reports]]'' in October 2015 uncovered how these defects, often associated with [[cancer]] development, [[congenital diseases]] and [[infertility]], evade the strict surveillance of the checkpoint mechanisms that ensure faithful [[genome]] segregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mirkovic|first=Mihailo|last2=Hutter|first2=Lukas H.|last3=Novák|first3=Béla|last4=Oliveira|first4=Raquel A.|date=2015-10|title=Premature Sister Chromatid Separation Is Poorly Detected by the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint as a Result of System-Level Feedback|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2211124715010311|journal=Cell Reports|volume=13|issue=3|pages=469–478|doi=10.1016/j.celrep.2015.09.020|pmid=26456822|issn=2211-1247}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mirkovic|first=Mihailo|last2=Hutter|first2=Lukas H.|last3=Novák|first3=Béla|last4=Oliveira|first4=Raquel A.|date=2015-10|title=Premature Sister Chromatid Separation Is Poorly Detected by the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint as a Result of System-Level Feedback|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2211124715010311|journal=Cell Reports|volume=13|issue=3|pages=469–478|doi=10.1016/j.celrep.2015.09.020|pmid=26456822|issn=2211-1247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- Ana Domingos and her group have shown that [[Adipose tissue|fat tissue]] is [[Nerve|innervated]] and that direct stimulation of [[neuron]]s in fat is sufficient to induce fat breakdown. These results published in September 2015 in the journal [[Cell (journal)|''Cell'']], set up the stage for developing novel [[Anti-obesity medication|anti-obesity]] therapies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zeng|first=Wenwen|last2=Pirzgalska|first2=Roksana M.|last3=Pereira|first3=Mafalda M.A.|last4=Kubasova|first4=Nadiya|last5=Barateiro|first5=Andreia|last6=Seixas|first6=Elsa|last7=Lu|first7=Yi-Hsueh|last8=Kozlova|first8=Albina|last9=Voss|first9=Henning|date=2015-09|title=Sympathetic Neuro-adipose Connections Mediate Leptin-Driven Lipolysis|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092867415011071|journal=Cell|volume=163|issue=1|pages=84–94|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2015.08.055|pmid=26406372|issn=0092-8674}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/44093/title/Neuronal-Connection-Between-Fat-and-the-Brain-Visualized/|title=Neuronal Connection Between Fat and the Brain Visualized|website=The Scientist Magazine®|language=en|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- Studies on the [[bacteria]] ''[[Wolbachia]]'' conducted by Luis Teixeira and his research group revealed that a single genomic change can turn beneficial bacteria into [[pathogenic bacteria]], by boosting bacterial density inside the host. ''Wolbachia'' is a bacterium commonly present in [[insect]] species that can protect their hosts against [[virus]]es, including the [[dengue fever]] virus. These findings were published in the journal [[PLOS Biology|''PLoS Biology'']] in February 2015, in the first study linking genes and their functions in the ''Wolbachia'' bacterium and providing a starting point for the understanding of the widespread insect-''Wolbachia'' symbiosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chrostek|first=Ewa|last2=Teixeira|first2=Luis|date=2015-02-10|title=Mutualism Breakdown by Amplification of Wolbachia Genes|journal=PLOS Biology|language=en|volume=13|issue=2|pages=e1002065|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002065|issn=1545-7885|pmc=4323108|pmid=25668031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- In a study published in the scientific journal [[Cell (journal)|''Cell'']] in December 2014, a research team at IGC led by Miguel Soares discovered that specific bacterial components in the human [[Gut flora|gut]] [[microbiota]] can trigger a natural defence mechanism that is highly protective against [[malaria]] transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yilmaz|first=Bahtiyar|last2=Portugal|first2=Silvia|last3=Tran|first3=Tuan M.|last4=Gozzelino|first4=Raffaella|last5=Ramos|first5=Susana|last6=Gomes|first6=Joana|last7=Regalado|first7=Ana|last8=Cowan|first8=Peter J.|last9=d’Apice|first9=Anthony J.F.|date=2014-12|title=Gut Microbiota Elicits a Protective Immune Response against Malaria Transmission|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092867414014251|journal=Cell|volume=159|issue=6|pages=1277–1289|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2014.10.053|issn=0092-8674|pmc=4261137|pmid=25480293}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bordon|first=Yvonne|date=2015-01|title=Gut bacteria cross malaria|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nri3796|journal=Nature Reviews Immunology|language=En|volume=15|issue=1|pages=1|doi=10.1038/nri3796|pmid=25534616|issn=1474-1733}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=IGCiencia|title=How gut bacteria are protective against malaria - Video animation|date=2014-12-05|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnAhiECenPc&amp;feature=youtu.be|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- Three research groups at IGC lead by Jocelyne Demengeot, Karina Xavier and Isabel Gordo joint efforts to unveil how the [[bacteria]] ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' (''E. coli''), one of the first species to colonize the [[Gut flora|human gut]] at birth, adapts and evolves in the [[mouse]] intestine. The study published in [[PLOS Genetics|''PLoS Genetics'']] in March 2014, showed that [[Escherichia coli|''E. coli'']] with different advantageous [[mutation]]s rapidly emerge and, consequently, a large [[genetic variation]] in this species is generated over time demonstrating how rich the [[evolutionary dynamics]] of each bacteria is in a healthy animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barroso-Batista|first=João|last2=Sousa|first2=Ana|last3=Lourenço|first3=Marta|last4=Bergman|first4=Marie-Louise|last5=Sobral|first5=Daniel|last6=Demengeot|first6=Jocelyne|last7=Xavier|first7=Karina B.|last8=Gordo|first8=Isabel|date=2014-03-06|title=The First Steps of Adaptation of Escherichia coli to the Gut Are Dominated by Soft Sweeps|journal=PLOS Genetics|language=en|volume=10|issue=3|pages=e1004182|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004182|issn=1553-7404|pmc=3945185|pmid=24603313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- The research team led by Henrique Teotónio in collaboration with Isabel Gordo, both from the IGC, has experimentally tested the [[Haldane's rule|Haldane's theory]] for the first time. The study was published in ''[[Nature Communications]]'' in September 2013 and confirmed this theory for the introduction of a new beneficial [[allele]] in a population. The study contributes to a better comprehension of how a population can evolve, with implications for studies on how species adapt to changing environments or species conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chelo|first=Ivo M.|last2=Nédli|first2=Judit|last3=Gordo|first3=Isabel|last4=Teotónio|first4=Henrique|date=2013-09-13|title=An experimental test on the probability of extinction of new genetic variants|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms3417|journal=Nature Communications|language=En|volume=4|issue=1|pages=2417|doi=10.1038/ncomms3417|issn=2041-1723|pmc=3778522|pmid=24030070}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/09/130913085804.htm|title=Fate of new genes cannot be predicted|work=ScienceDaily|access-date=2018-08-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- In August 2013, the research team led by Miguel Godinho Ferreira in collaboration with Isabel Gordo, showed for the first time that [[Chromosomal rearrangement|chromosomes rearrangements]] (such as inversions or translocations) can provide advantages to the cells that harbor them depending on the environment they are exposed.

- The researcher Miguel Soares co-authored a review in [[Science (journal)|''Science'']], in February 2012, on a largely overlooked strategy for treating [[infectious diseases]]. The [[immune system]] protects from infections by detecting and eliminating invading pathogens. The authors purposed a third strategy considering tolerance to infection, whereby the infected host protects itself from infection by reducing tissue damage and other negative effects caused by the pathogen or the immune response against the invader.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Medzhitov|first=Ruslan|last2=Schneider|first2=David S.|last3=Soares|first3=Miguel P.|date=2012-02-24|title=Disease Tolerance as a Defense Strategy|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/335/6071/936|journal=Science|language=en|volume=335|issue=6071|pages=936–941|doi=10.1126/science.1214935|issn=0036-8075|pmc=3564547|pmid=22363001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- In December 2011 the study published in ''[[Developmental Cell]]'' by Lar Jansen and his team uncovered a very simple, neat mechanism whereby the cell couples DNA duplication, [[cell division]] and [[centromere]] assembly. By using the same machinery for all these steps but in opposite ways, the cells confirm that the right number of copies of both genes and centromeres are made by allowing each the appropriate time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Silva|first=Mariana C.C.|last2=Bodor|first2=Dani L.|last3=Stellfox|first3=Madison E.|last4=Martins|first4=Nuno M.C.|last5=Hochegger|first5=Helfrid|last6=Foltz|first6=Daniel R.|last7=Jansen|first7=Lars E.T.|date=2012-01|title=Cdk Activity Couples Epigenetic Centromere Inheritance to Cell Cycle Progression|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1534580711004667|journal=Developmental Cell|volume=22|issue=1|pages=52–63|doi=10.1016/j.devcel.2011.10.014|pmid=22169070|issn=1534-5807}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- A team led by Florence Janody have uncovered a surprising link between the cell's skeleton and organ size. It was shown in a study published in ''Development'', in April 2011, that one of the proteins that regulates the [[Cytoskeleton|skeleton]] of the cell also acts to blocks activation of genes that promote cell survival and proliferation. These findings add to the puzzle of understanding how proliferation genes are abnormally activated, often leading to tumours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fernández|first=Beatriz García|last2=Gaspar|first2=Pedro|last3=Brás-Pereira|first3=Catarina|last4=Jezowska|first4=Barbara|last5=Rebelo|first5=Sofia Raquel|last6=Janody|first6=Florence|date=2011-06-01|title=Actin-Capping Protein and the Hippo pathway regulate F-actin and tissue growth in Drosophila|url=http://dev.biologists.org/content/138/11/2337|journal=Development|language=en|volume=138|issue=11|pages=2337–2346|doi=10.1242/dev.063545|issn=0950-1991|pmid=21525075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- A research team led by Miguel Soares found that free [[heme]], released from red blood cells during infection, is the cause of organ failure, leading to the lethal outcome of severe [[sepsis]]. Moreover, the team found that the toxic effect of free heme can be overcome by hemopexin, a naturally occurring molecule that neutralises free heme. These findings were published in the ''[[Science Translational Medicine]]'' journal in September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Larsen|first=Rasmus|last2=Gozzelino|first2=Raffaella|last3=Jeney|first3=Viktória|last4=Tokaji|first4=László|last5=Bozza|first5=Fernando A.|last6=Japiassú|first6=André M.|last7=Bonaparte|first7=Dolores|last8=Cavalcante|first8=Moisés Marinho|last9=Chora|first9=Ângelo|date=2010-09-29|title=A Central Role for Free Heme in the Pathogenesis of Severe Sepsis|url=http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/2/51/51ra71|journal=Science Translational Medicine|language=en|volume=2|issue=51|pages=51ra71|doi=10.1126/scitranslmed.3001118|issn=1946-6234|pmid=20881280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- A study published in [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'',]] in September 2010, by a team of researchers led by Miguel Godinho Ferreira solved a paradox related to [[telomere]]s, the protective tips of [[chromosome]]s. The broken chromosome ends generated by DNA damage are quickly joined together. However, telomeres are never tied to each other, thus allowing for the correct segregation of the genetic material into all cells. The researchers found that one of the [[histone]]s neighbouring the telomeres lacks a chemical signal, thus rendering the DNA damage recognition machinery incapable of arresting the [[cell cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carneiro|first=Tiago|last2=Khair|first2=Lyne|last3=Reis|first3=Clara C.|last4=Borges|first4=Vanessa|last5=Moser|first5=Bettina A.|last6=Nakamura|first6=Toru M.|last7=Ferreira|first7=Miguel Godinho|date=2010-09-09|title=Telomeres avoid end detection by severing the checkpoint signal transduction pathway|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=467|issue=7312|pages=228–232|doi=10.1038/nature09353|issn=0028-0836|pmc=3196630|pmid=20829797}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== PhD Programmes ==
The IGC has started the postgraduate training with the format of a PhD programme in 1993 with the Gulbenkian PhD Programme in Biology and Medicine (PGDBM) followed by the Gulbenkian PhD Programme in Biomedicine (PGDB). In 2013, 20 years after the first structured PhD programme in Portugal, the [[Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia|Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia]] (FCT) started supporting the PhD Programme in Integrative Biomedical Sciences (PDIGC - PIBS) that has been continued as the [http://www.igc.gulbenkian.pt/education/ibbprogramme PhD Programme in Integrative Biology and Biomedicine] (IBB), the current programme. In 2014, a new and ambitious [http://www.igc.gulbenkian.pt/education/pgcd PhD programme was launched, the Graduate Program Science for Development] (PGCD) that aims to educate a new generation of excellent scientists and university professors in life sciences in the African countries of Portuguese language (PALOP) and East Timor.

The IGC is also part of a joint [http://www.itqb.unl.pt/education/phdhostmicrointerface PhD Program Biology at the Host Microbe Interface] (INTERFACE) ran by the [http://www.itqb.unl.pt/ Instituto de Tecnologia Química e Biológica] (ITQB NOVA), Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência (IGC) and [https://imm.medicina.ulisboa.pt/en/ Instituto de Medicina Molecular] (iMM).

The IGC has also had two other PhD Programmes, the [http://pdbc.igc.gulbenkian.pt/index.php?menu=home PhD Programme in Computational Biology] (PDBC) the first doctoral programme in computational biology in Portugal launched in 2005, and the Programme for Advanced Medical Education (PGMFA), both important to fulfil gaps in research and training of these two fields.

== Science Outreach ==
The dialogue between scientists and society is crucial and the IGC is committed to promoting this interaction, both at the Institute and wider afield. Open Days, Researchers' Night, school's outreach and informal education programmes reach every year hundreds of students, teachers and the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.igc.gulbenkian.pt/outreach|title=IGC {{!}} Outreach|website=www.igc.gulbenkian.pt|language=pt|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Infrastructure ==
The IGC is resourced with state-of-the-art equipment and facilities, and run by highly qualified staff. Facilities include bio-computing services, animal SPF ([[Specific-pathogen-free|Specific Pathogen Free]]) facilities including a "germ-free" unit, transgenics unit, plant facility, high-speed cell sorting, [[Electron microscope|electron]] and advanced microscopy, next generation sequencing, monoclonal antibody preparation and histopathology. Other services include a library, a dedicated in-house data center and IT team, as well as a research funding office and project management team.

Coelho is currently a Research Affiliate at the [[MIT Media Lab]] and creative director at Marcelo Coelho Studio, an anti-disciplinary studio dedicated to technically innovative and experimental work based in [[Boston, MA]].

Marcelo Coelho graduated from [[Concordia University]] with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Design and Computation Arts, and received a [[Master of Science]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy]] from the [[MIT Media Lab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/46577 |title=Materials of Interaction: responsive materials in the design of transformable interactive surfaces |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/79305 |title=Materializing Interaction |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Coelho makes objects, installations, and live experiences that challenges people's perception of material properties and behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coolhunting.com/design/marcelo-coelho |title=Marcelo Coelho: Stunning Explorations in physical interface design from an MIT Media Lab student |publisher=Cool Hunting |last=Killeen |first=Meghan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his works use techniques and concepts from [[Composite materials|composites]], [[3D printing|digital fabrication]] and [[programmable matter]].

Six-Forty by Four-Eighty, a 2010 installation by Coelho, uses interactive physical pixels and body communication to convey an immersive digital graffiti experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://howtospendit.ft.com/art/2818-thats-a-beautiful-code |title=That’s a beautiful code |publisher=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/art-and-architecture/playtime-technology-advances-are-a-marvel-for-kids-and-grown-ups-alike/article23313630/ |title=Digital play exhibition offers marvels for kids and grown-ups alike |publisher=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Sandcastles, Coelho collaborated with artist [[Vik Muniz]] to etch drawings of castles originally created with a [[camera lucida]] onto grains of sand, using a [[focused ion beam]] and [[scanning electron microscope]].
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-03/31/sandcastles |title=Microscopic castles etched onto grains of sand |publisher=Wired.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/creating-sand-castles-with-a-single-grain-of-sand |title=Creating Sand Castles With A Single Grain Of Sand |publisher=The Creators Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hyperform, Coelho developed a chandelier that is assembled from a single 3D printed chain, and where the assembly information is encoded in the material itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fastcodesign.com/3017569/a-chandelier-that-can-practically-assemble-itself |title=A Chandelier That Can Practically Assemble Itself |publisher=Fast Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''master class''' is a [[class (education)|class]] given to [[students]] of a particular [[discipline (academia)|discipline]] by an [[expert]] of that discipline&amp;mdash;usually [[music]], but also [[painting]], [[drama]], any of the [[arts]], or on any other occasion where skills are being developed.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

== Around music ==

The difference between a normal class and a master class is typically the setup.  In a master class, all the students (and often spectators) watch and listen as the master takes one student at a time.&lt;ref&gt;Piers Spencer [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/opr/t114/e4274 Master class] from [[Oxford Music Online]]&lt;/ref&gt; The student (typically intermediate or advanced, depending on the status of the master) usually performs a single [[piece (music)|piece]] which they have prepared, and the master will give them advice on how to play it, often including [[anecdotes]] about the [[composer]], demonstrations of how to play certain passages, and admonitions of common technical errors.  The student is then usually expected to play the piece again, in light of the master's comments, and the student may be asked to play a passage repeatedly to attain perfection.  Master classes for [[musical instruments]] tend to focus on the finer details of attack, [[timbre|tone]], [[musical phrasing|phrasing]], and overall shape, and the student is expected to have complete control of more basic elements such as [[rhythm]] and [[pitch (music)|pitch]]. The value of the master class setup is that all students can benefit from the master's comments on each piece.

Many concert performers have given master classes, starting with its inventor [[Franz Liszt]]&lt;ref&gt;Alan Walker, et al. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/48265 Franz Liszt] from Oxford Music Online&lt;/ref&gt; and including such greats as [[Yehudi Menuhin]], [[Isaac Stern]], [[Itzhak Perlman]], and [[Vladimir Horowitz]].  Often, a touring performer will give a master class the day before, or the day of, their performance in a particular city.  Giving a master class before a concert provides both artistic stimulation for the performer and a means of obtaining a larger audience.

Aspiring classical musicians, and their teachers, typically consider master classes to be one of the most effective means of musical development, along with [[competitions]], [[examinations]], and practice.

Some [[musical theatre]] composers will also give master classes to college students studying performance.

Some speciality classes may be referred to as 'mini master classes'. These can involve short, faster lessons on a new subject. Students, typically experienced in one discipline, may attend these classes to learn the basics of a new, related discipline.

==Kelvin in Baltimore==
In 1884, [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin]] delivered twenty lectures on molecular dynamics and the wave theory of light.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kargon and Peter Achinstein (1987) ''Kelvin’s Baltimore Lectures and Modern Theoretical Physics: historical and philosophical perspectives'', [[MIT Press]] {{ISBN|0-262-11117-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kargon wrote (page 2):
:The sessions, which were held in a small lecture hall, were conducted as "master classes". The tone was conversational and informal; Kelvin made almost no use of notes ...  Usually Kelvin lectured from one of these standpoints, then engaged the audience in a discussion of the details, then shifted to another of the standpoints for the second part of the lecture.
On page one Kargon explained, "The attendees were expected to have advanced knowledge of physics and mathematics. Among them were British physicists [[Lord Rayleigh]] and [[George Forbes (scientist)|George Forbes]]; Professors [[Kikuchi Dairoku|Kikuchi]] and Fujioka of Japan; American instructors in physics from eastern and western colleges, including [[Albert Michelson]] and [[Edward Morley]]; attendees from Canada, Germany, and Russia; and Hopkins faculty and students including [[H. A. Rowland|Rowland]], [[Thomas Craig (mathematician)|Thomas Craig]], [[Fabian Franklin]], [[Henry Crew]], Gustav Liebig, [[Joseph Sweetman Ames]], and [[Christine Ladd Franklin]]."

A record of the twenty classes was made by [[A. S. Hathaway]] and circulated afterwards using [[Mimeograph#Papyrograph|papyrograph]] stencil duplication. It is these notes that were reproduced in 1987 for the publication sponsored by Johns Hopkins Center for the History and Philosophy of Science. In fact Hathaway continued to correspond with Kelvin, who supplemented the notes, and the "Lectures" were eventually broadly circulated in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Thomson, Lord Kelvin]] (1904) [https://archive.org/details/baltimorelecture00kelviala Molecular dynamics and the wave theory of light], twenty lectures transcribed by A.S. Hathaway, [[Cambridge University Press]], link from [[Internet Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strasbourg==
The [[music conservatory]] at Strasbourg conducts regular master classes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conservatoire.strasbourg.eu/categories/master-classes/ Strasbourg Conservatory]&lt;/ref&gt; Yann Martin at [[University of Strasbourg]] conducts Master Class Management sessions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unistra.fr/uploads/media/masterclass-philo-2014-web_01.pdf Philosophy master class] at University of Strasborg&lt;/ref&gt; And advanced [[geometry]] is explored at Institute de Research en Mathematiques, Interactions, et Applications: [http://labex-irmia.u-strasbg.fr/spip.php?rubrique4 Master class archives].

'''''Mystery Train: Images of America in Rock 'N' Roll Music''''' is a [[non-fiction]] book written in 1975 by [[Greil Marcus]]. It features critical essays centered around artists such as [[Elvis Presley]], [[Sly Stone]], [[Robert Johnson]], and [[Randy Newman]].
==Authorship==
[[Greil Marcus]], rock critic and columnist for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', and contributor to other publications, such as ''[[Creem]]'', the ''[[The Village Voice|Village Voice]]'', and ''[[Artforum]]'', wrote ''Mystery Train'' in 1975. In the prologue, he relates that the book "is no attempt at synthesis, but a recognition of unities in the American imagination that already exist."&lt;ref name=gre&gt;Marcus (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; The writing, according to the author, took about "two years of doing nothing else."&lt;ref name=sheff&gt;Sheffield (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Mystery Train'', according to one reviewer, reflects on what could be called "the historical turn" that rock took at the close of the [[1960s in music|60s]], initiated by [[Bob Dylan]] and [[the Band]], and followed through by everyone from [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]] to [[Randy Newman]], the music moving "beyond rock'n'roll's teenage immersion in the present to an adult sophistication steeped in deep knowledge of rock's roots in blues and country and lyrics that likewise looked to the past for inspiration."&lt;ref name=rey&gt;Reynolds (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to another reviewer, Marcus proceeds in his examination of American popular culture with the "democratic assumption" that Presley and [[Herman Melville]] are already cultural and political equals, and are, therefore, "in conversation with one another - having a dialogue about freedom and limits, innovation and tradition, American dreams and American obsessions."&lt;ref name=cant&gt;Cantwell (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; When the 2nd edition came out, Elvis had recently died, and Marcus was asked to amend the chapter relating to Elvis by putting everything in the [[past tense]] but he refused, because, he said, "Elvis' presence was so powerful, I felt he's always in the [[present tense]]."&lt;ref name=&gt;Sheffield (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Mystery Train'' opens with an episode on the ''[[Dick Cavett show]]'', where [[Little Richard]] interrupts a disagreement between a writer and a critic, and closes with a [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcript]] of [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] arguing with producer [[Sam Phillips]] as they are setting up to record "[[Great Balls of Fire]]" in 1957.&lt;ref name=gre&gt;Marcus (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==Critical reception==
[[Frank Rich]] reviewed the book for ''[[The Village Voice]]'' and wrote that Marcus' "frame of reference is so vast that he never runs out of connections worth making between the music he loves and just about anything else that matters in American art and life.”&lt;ref name=garner/&gt; [[David Itzkoff]] and [[Alan Light]], in a 2005 critical roundup of music-related books, claimed that ''Myster Train'' is "perhaps the finest book ever written about pop music."&lt;ref name=itz&gt;Itzkoff, Light (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[New York Times]]'' literary critic [[Dwight Garner (critic)|Dwight Garner]] stated in 2015 that "most critics and serious listeners think [''Mystery Train'']’s almost certainly the best book yet written about American music in general, and about rock in particular."&lt;ref name=garner&gt;Garner (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine picked it among the "100 best and most influential [books] written in English since 1923."&lt;ref name=time&gt;''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nathalie Bondil''' (February 19, 1967), who holds both Canadian and French citizenship, has been Director General and Chief Curator of the [[Montreal Museum of Fine Arts]] since 2007. She has worked at the museum since 1999, and is the first woman to be the museum's director.

== Quote ==
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I am convinced that in the twenty-first century, culture will be to health what sports were in the twenthieth century: cultural experiences will be seen to contribute to our well-being the same way sports do to our physical conditioning... Art does one good. I am convinced."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Biography ==
Nathalie Bondil holds a degree in art history from the [[École du Louvre]]. She successfully passed the entry examination for the École nationale du Patrimoine de Paris in 1994, then graduated in 1996, thereby becoming ''Conservateur du patrimoine d'État''.

From 1996 to 1998, she worked at the [[Musée des Monuments Français]] (which now forms part of the [[Cité de l'architecture et du patrimoine]]) as curator in charge of museography for the galeries dedicated to the 17th to 20th centuries, as part of the museum's renovation.

In 1999, she was hired as curator for European art from 1800 to 1945, and in 2000, promoted to chief curator, taking charge of the Curatorial Department, Conservation, the Library, Archives, Publishing and Ehxibitions. She has been the Director of the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts and its Chief Curator since 2007.

When she took over the helm of the MMFA, she launched a series of exhibitions that have distinguished the Museum on the international scene (exported in 35 cities over the last ten years) and innovative multidisciplinary programming: she invited fashion to the Museum (first retrospectives on ''Yves Saint Laurent'' and ''The Fashion World of Jean Paul Gaultier,'' presented in 12 cities around the world); opened it up to world cultures (''Peru: Kingdoms of the Sun and the Moon''); revamped contemporary art programming (''1+1=1''; ''Peter Doig''); and has introduced music through exhibitions (''Warhol Live; Imagine; We Want Miles''), an ongoing collaboration with foundation-in-residence Arte Musica and the daring conversion of a heritage church into a 462-seat professional concert hall, Bourgie Hall, which presents around 150 concerts and welcomes around 50,000 spectators each year.

In 2011, with the addition of a 4th building, '''The Claire and Marc Bourgie Quebec and Canadian art Pavilion''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mbam.qc.ca/en/museum-district/claire-and-marc-bourgie-pavilion/|title=Claire and Marc Bourgie Pavilion|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nathalie Bondil and her team undertook the restoration and reinstallation of some 4,000 works from the collection, from world cultures to Old Masters and Canadian and contemporary art. This "reinvented Museum" includes an impressive Pavilion of Decorative Arts and Design that was recently reinstalled and an expanded '''sculpture garden'''.

In 2012, she also led the expansion of the new educational facilities for school groups and families – '''the Studios Art &amp; Education Michel de la Chenelière'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mbam.qc.ca/en/education/studio-art-education-michel-de-la-cheneliere/|title=Studios Art &amp; Education Michel de la Chenelières|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the major gift of Michal and Renata Hornstein’s collection of 100 Old Masters, the Museum expanded again allowing for the overhaul of over 3,000 additional works: a fifth building, '''the Michal and Renata Hornstein Pavilion for Peace''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mbam.qc.ca/en/museum-district/future-michal-and-renata-hornstein-pavilion-for-peace/|title=Pavilion for Peace|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151101005529/http://www.mbam.qc.ca/en/museum-district/future-michal-and-renata-hornstein-pavilion-for-peace/|archivedate=2015-11-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; devoted to international art and education, was inaugurated in 2016. It houses '''the Michel de la Chenelière International Atelier for Education and Art Therapy'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mbam.qc.ca/en/frontpage-article/michel-de-la-cheneliere-international-atelier-for-education-and-art-therapy/|title=Michel de la Chenelière International Atelier for Education and Art-Therapy|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which will give unparalleled impulse to the Museum’s educational and social mission. The MMFA comprises the largest educational complex at a North American art museum.

Over the past 10 years, Nathalie Bondil has sought to assert the MMFA's social relevance through its culture of innovation, with its bold multidisciplinary approach, a focus on education and respect for the audiences, unifying values and innovative forms of cooperation. She has been striving to make the MMFA empathetic and humanist in its contributions to the education and well-being of citizens and their society; a pioneer in anticipating future needs and a laboratory for innovation.

Along with working with 450 community organizations, schools, universities and associations to become an accessible and democratic hub for the arts, the MMFA's Art and Health Advisory Committee chaired by Quebec’s Chief Scientist, Rémi Quirion (a first in a Canadian museum!), was set up to oversee all pilot projects and partnerships with hospitals and the scientific research community (Alzheimer Society, Heart Institute, Douglas Hospital Research Institute, CHU Sainte-Justine.). Under Nathalie Bondil's leadership, the MMFA has also hired a full-time art therapist (a first in a museum), opened two art therapy offices in the new Michal and Renata Hornstein Pavilion for Peace (another first) as well as an art hive (another first in a museum yet again) in partnership with Concordia University to provide a place for artistic expression that is free and open to all.

Nathalie Bondil is Vice-Chair of the Canada Council for the Arts; and a member of the boards of the Chambre de commerce du Montréal Métropolitain and the Council for Canadian American Relations, of the Association of Art Museum Directors (AAMD), of the French &amp; American Museum Exchange (FRAME), the Canadian Art Museum Directors Organization (CAMDO), Fonderie Darling, Comité conseil - Chaire de recherche de l'UQÀM sur la gouvernance des musées et le droit de la culture, and Comité consultatif national des HEC (Montréal). She was Vice-Chair and a member of the programming Committee of the Société des célébrations du &lt;abbr&gt;375&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/abbr&gt; anniversaire de Montréal.

'''National Institute of Securities Markets''' (NISM) is an [[India]]n [[public trust]] and an educational institute and staff college of SEBI established in 2006 by the [[Securities and Exchange Board of India]] (SEBI) the regulator for the securities market in India. The institute offers academic programmes, training programmes, capacity building and skill development programmes in [[securities market]]s. The institute also provides financial education and standards to improve financial literacy in the country. The institute is located in [[Vashi]], [[Navi Mumbai]], India. A 72-acre campus at Patalganga (off-[[Mumbai Pune Expressway|Mumbai-Pune Expressway]]), for the institute, was inaugurated by [[Narendra Modi]], incumbent [[Prime Minister of India]], on 24 December 2016. NISM is an powerful autonomous body governed by a [[Board of Governors]]. Ajay Tyagi, the Chairman of SEBI, is the incumbent chairman of NISM. Dr. M. Thenmozhi is the incumbent Director of NISM. The institute is divided into six schools that address the different participants of the Indian [[financial market]].

==History==
In the Budget Speech of February 2006, [[P. Chidambaram|P Chidambaram]], the erstwhile Union [[Finance minister of India|Finance Minister]], proposed to authorize the Securities and Exchange Board of India to set up a National Institute of Securities Markets for teaching and training intermediaries in securities markets and promoting research. Accordingly, NISM was established in 2006.  NISM seeks to add to market quality through educational initiatives.  It is an autonomous body governed by its Board of Governors. An International Advisory Council provides strategic guidance to NISM.

==Structure==
The activities of NISM are carried out under six schools. These are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;http://nism.ac.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=46&amp;Itemid=34&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7214">[[Language]] has a long evolutionary history and is closely related to the [[brain]], but what makes the [[human]] brain uniquely adapted to language is unclear. The regions of the brain that are involved in language in humans have similar analogues in apes and monkeys, and yet they do not use language. There may also be a [[gene]]tic component: mutations in the [[FOXP2]] gene prevent humans from constructing complete sentences.&lt;ref name=disorders&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marcus|first=G.|author2=Rabagliati, H.|title=What developmental disorders can tell us about the nature and origins of language|journal=Nature Neuroscience|year=2006|volume=9|pages=1226–1229|doi=10.1038/nn1766|url=http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v9/n10/full/nn1766.html|issue=10|pmid=17001342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neurobiological adaptations for language ==

=== Broca's and Wernicke's areas ===
{{Main|Broca's area|Wernicke's area}}
These regions are where language is located in the brain&amp;nbsp;– everything from [[speech]] to [[Reading (process)|reading]] and [[writing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoff|first=E|title=Language Development|year=2009|publisher=Wadsworth|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=978-0-495-50171-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Language itself is based on symbols used to represent concepts in the world, and this system appears to be housed in these areas. The language regions in human brains highly resemble similar regions in other primates, even though humans are the only species that use language.&lt;ref name=coevolution&gt;{{cite web|last=Boulton|first=David|title=Terrence Deacon, Ph.D. - The Co-evolution of Language and the Brain|url=http://www.childrenofthecode.org/interviews/deacon.htm|accessdate=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The brain structures of chimps are very similar to those of humans. Both contain Broca's and Wernicke's [[Homology (biology)|homologues]] that are involved in communication. Broca's area is largely used for planning and producing vocalizations in both chimps and humans. Wernicke's area appears to be where linguistic representations and symbols are mapped to specific concepts. This functionality is present in both chimps and humans; the chimp Wernicke's area is much more similar to its human counterpart than is the Broca's area, suggesting that Wernicke's is more evolutionary ancient than Broca's.&lt;ref name=brocas /&gt;

=== Motor neurons ===
[[File:Sagittalmouth.png|thumb|300px|[[Sagittal plane|Sagittal section]] of human vocal tract]]
In order to speak, the breathing system must be voluntarily repurposed to produce vocal sounds,&lt;ref name=coevolution /&gt; which allows the breathing mechanisms to be temporarily deactivated in favor of [[song]] or speech production. The human [[vocal tract]] has evolved to be more suited to speaking, with a lower [[larynx]], 90° turn in the windpipe, and large, round tongue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Stephen|title=Doctor Dolittle's Delusion|year=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=London|isbn=0-300-10339-5|pages=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Motor neurons]] in birds and humans bypass the unconscious systems in the brainstem to give direct control of the larynx to the brain.&lt;ref name=semanticurge /&gt;

== Theories of language origin ==

=== Gestural origin ===
The earliest language was strictly vocal; reading and writing came later.&lt;ref name=coevolution /&gt; New research suggests that the combination of [[gestures]] and vocalizations may have led to the development of more complicated language in protohumans. Chimps that produce attention-getting sounds show activation in areas of the brain that are highly similar to Broca's area in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arbib|first=M.|author2=Bota, M.|title=Language evolution: neural homologies and neuroimformatics|journal=Neural Networks|year=2003|volume=16|doi=10.1016/j.neunet.2003.08.002|pages=1237–1260}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taglialatela|first=J. P.|author2=Russell, J. L. |author3=Schaeffer, J. A. |author4=Hopkins, W. D. |title=Chimpanzee Vocal Signaling Points to a Multimodal Origin of Human Language|journal=PLoS ONE|date=20 April 2011|volume=6|series=4|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0018852 |pages=e18852 |pmid=21533079 |pmc=3080370}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even hand and mouth movements with no vocalizations cause very similar activation patterns in the Broca's area of both humans and monkeys.&lt;ref name=brocas&gt;{{cite web|last=Falk|first=D|title=The Evolution of Broca's Area|url=http://www.ibro.info/Pub/Pub_Main_Display.asp?LC_Docs_ID=3145}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; When monkeys view other monkeys gesturing, [[mirror neurons]] in the Broca's homologue activate. Groups of mirror neurons are specialized to respond only to one kind of viewed action, and it is currently believed that these may be an evolutionary origin to the neurons that are adapted for speech processing and production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fadiga|first=L|author2=Craighero, L. |author3=D'Ausilio, A |title=Broca's Area in Language, Action, and Music|journal=The Neurosciences and Music III—Disorders and Plasticity|year=2009|volume=1169|pages=448–458|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04582.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Universal grammar ===
The [[language bioprogram hypothesis]] proposes that humans have an innate, [[cognitive]] [[grammar|grammatical]] structure allowing them to develop and understand language. According to this theory, this system is embedded in human genetics and underpins the basic grammar of all languages.&lt;ref name=brocas /&gt; Some evidence suggests that at least some of our linguistic capacities may be genetically controlled. Mutations in the [[FOXP2]] gene prevent people from combining words and phrases into sentences.&lt;ref name=disorders /&gt; However, these genes are present in the heart, lungs, and brain, and their role is not entirely clear.&lt;ref name=disorders /&gt;

It is possible that the human capacity for grammar evolved from non-semantic behavior like singing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deacon|first1=TW|title=Colloquium paper: a role for relaxed selection in the evolution of the language capacity|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=11 May 2010|volume=107 Suppl 2|pages=9000-6|doi=10.1073/pnas.0914624107|pmid=20445088|pmc=3024028}}&lt;/ref&gt; Birds have the ability to produce, process, and learn complex vocalizations, but the units of a birdsong, when removed from the larger meaning and context of the birdsong as a whole, have no inherent meaning. Early hominids may have evolved capacities for similar, non-semantic purposes, that were later modified for symbolic language.&lt;ref name=semanticurge&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sereno|first=M. I.|title=Language origins without the semantic urge|journal=Cognitive Science Online|year=2005|volume=3|issue=1|pages=1–12|url=http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/~sereno/papers/LangOrigins05.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nutritional anthropology''' is the interplay between [[human biology]], [[economic systems]], [[nutrition|nutritional status]] and [[food security]], and how changes in the former affect the latter. If economic and environmental changes in a community affect access to food, food security, and dietary health, then this interplay between culture and biology is in turn connected to broader historical and economic trends associated with globalization. Nutritional status affects overall health status, work performance potential, and the overall potential for economic development (either in terms of human development or traditional western models) for any given group of people.

==General economics and nutrition==
===General economic summary===
Most scholars construe economy as involving the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services within and between societies.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} A key concept in a broad study of economies (versus a particular econometric study of commodities and stock markets) is social relations. For instance, many [[economic anthropology|economic anthropologists]] state that the [[:wikt:reciprocal|reciprocal]] gift exchange, competitive gift exchange, and impersonal market exchange are all reflective of dominant paradigms of social relations within a given society.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} The main forms of economy extant around most of the world today, in terms of a simple production, distribution, consumption model, are subsistence based and market economies. Subsistence refers to production and consumption on a small-scale of the household or community, while a market-based economy implies a much broader scale of production, distribution, and consumption. A [[market economy]] also entails the exchange of goods for currency, versus bartering commodities or being under continuing reciprocal gift exchange obligations. This is not to say that market economies do not coexist with subsistence economies and other forms, but that one type usually dominates within a given society. However, a broad array of scholarship exists, stating that market economies are rapidly increasing in importance on a global scale, even in societies that have traditionally relied much more heavily on [[subsistence production]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} This economic shift has nutritional implications that this entry will explore further.

===Modes of production and nutrition===
The most important step in understanding the links between economics and nutrition is to understand major modes of production that societies have used to produce the goods (and services) they have needed throughout human history; these modes are foraging, shifting cultivation, pastoralism, agriculture, and industrialism (Park 2006).
 
Foraging, also known as [[hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]], is a subsistence strategy in which a group of people gathers wild plants and hunts wild animals in order to obtain food. This strategy was the sole mode of existence for human beings for the vast majority of human history (inclusive of the archeological and fossil record) and continued to be practiced by a few groups at least into the middle part of the 20th century. This mode of production is generally associated with small, nomadic groups of no more than fifty, also known as bands. The vast majority of foraging societies do not acknowledge exclusive ownership of land or other major resources, though they do acknowledge primary use rights for groups and people may individually possess small objects or tools such as a bow or cutting tools. Because foraging usually involves frequent movement and taking food naturally available rather than altering landscapes for production, many scholars state the foraging has a minimal negative environmental impact compared to other modes of production. Though foragers are generally limited in absolute amount of food available in a given area, foraging groups such as the [[!Kung people|!Kung]] in the [[Kalahari Desert]] have often been cited as having a more diverse diet and spending less time per week procuring food than societies that practice other modes of production such as intensive agriculture. &lt;br /&gt;
 
[[Shifting cultivation]] is a mode of production involving the low intensity production of plant-based foods; this mode is also known as horticulture or ‘slash and burn agriculture’ in some texts. Horticultural societies are generally situated in semi-sedentary villages of a few hundred that clear a field and burn the cleared vegetation in order to use the ashes to nourish the soil (hence the phrase slash and burn). Next, the group plants a crop or crops in this clearing and uses it for cultivation for several years. At the end of this period, the entire village relocates and starts the process anew, leaving the old clearing fallow for a period of decades in order to allow regeneration through the regrowth of wild vegetation. These food items can be supplemented through the raising of livestock, hunting wild game, and in many cases with the gathering of wild plants (Miller 2005; Park 2006). Though periodic movement precludes absolute permanent ownership of land, some horticultural societies fiercely defend current territories and practice violence against neighboring groups. For instance, [[Napoleon Chagnon]] (1997) depicts the [[Yanamamo]] of [[Venezuela]] and [[Brazil]] as the “Fierce People”, though others have been highly critical of Chagnon’s account of this society. Horticulture can also produce a broad diet, and in some cases more food per unit of land area than foraging. Though populations of horticulturalists tend to have greater density than those of foragers, they are generally less dense than those which practice other modes of production. If practiced on a small scale, over a large area, with long fallow periods, horticulture has less negative environmental impact than agriculture or industrialism, but more than foraging (Miller 2005). Generally, horticulture coincides with a subsistence type of economy in terms of production, distribution.
 
[[Pastoralism]], defined as reliance on products from livestock coupled with a seasonal nomadic herding tradition, is similar to horticulture in that it is extensive in its use of land area. Social groups in pastoral societies tend to have similar numbers and population density to horticultural societies. Pastoral societies often trade animal products with agricultural societies for plant based foods to augment their diet. Frequent movement often means that pastoralism has a similar environmental impact to horticulture, though instances of overgrazing, and consequent land degradation (see later subsection under Globalization and Nutrition), have been sited in some cases. Pastoralism generally entails a greater reliance on meat or other animal products, such as milk or blood, than other modes of production. This mode of production has a similar use rights profile to shifting cultivation. Traditionally, pastoralism has coincided with a subsistence based economy, but in the last several decades, some pastoralist societies, such as [[Mongolia]], have herded animals and practiced nomadic living patterns but have produced livestock primarily for market exchange.
 
[[Agriculture]], sometimes referred to as intensive agriculture, involves clearing and using the same plot of land for an extended period, sometimes several generations; it also involves the use of plows and [[draft animals]] in the preparation of land for planting and the cultivation of crops. Agriculture often supports much higher population densities than other modes of production (except industrialism) and agricultural societies can range in population from a few thousand into the millions. Though agriculture produces more food per unit of land area than the previously mentioned modes, the tendency of agricultural societies to focus on relatively few crops has often meant that these societies have much less diverse diets than foraging and horticultural societies. There is some archaeological and fossil evidence that populations in transition from foraging to agriculture have tended to suffer reduced stature, reduced musculature, and to exhibit other markers of malnutrition. Research has suggested that agriculture paradoxically allows a higher, but less healthy population for a given area. The advent of agriculture has marked that advent of social stratification in many parts of the world, with marked differentials in access to resources between segments of the same society. This mode of production also is more likely to entail permanent individual or family ownership of particular tracts of land than previously mentioned modes of production. Agriculture has co-occurred with both subsistence and market economies, often with a single society exhibiting some degree of both types of economies and has a more negative impact on the environment than the aforementioned modes of production.
 
[[Industrialism]] combines agriculture with mechanized industrial production of goods through the use of [[fossil fuels]]. Additionally, industrial societies use mechanized equipment in order to prepare land for planting, harvest crops, and distribute food to locations distant from where the original crops were planted. Industrialism shows similar trends to agriculture in terms of population density, and environmental impact, except to a much greater degree. Dietary diversity can be highly variable under an industrial mode of production and can depend on access to foods produced for local subsistence on the one hand, or to income level and purchasing power visa vie foods available in food markets (Leatherman and Goodman 2005). Dietary diversity and nutritional health often correlate with the degree of social stratification within an industrial society and sometimes between societies. With the exception of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] model states, industrial societies are heavily based on the concept of private property rights and the accumulation of profit through “free enterprise”.
 
The general trend for many societies over the past several millennia has been toward agriculture, and in the past two centuries, toward industrialism. Though these two modes of production are by no means superior to other modes in every respect, the fact that societies that practice them tend to have larger populations, higher population densities, and a more complex social structure has correlated with the geographic expansion of agricultural and industrial societies at the expense of societies emphasizing other modes of production. Concurrent with this trend toward intensified agricultural and industrial production has been the rise of the social and economic paradigm of capitalism, which entails the production and sale of goods and services in the market place in order to produce a profit. These trends have had profound implications for nutritional status for human beings on a global scale. In order to discern how broader economic and environmental trends affect a community’s food systems, food security, and nutritional status, it is important to summarize one of the most significant economic and ecological phenomena today, [[globalization]]. The next section will treat the linkages between economic and ideological trends over the last several centuries and environmental and political economic factors affecting access to food and nutritional status.

==Globalization and nutrition==
===General summary of globalization===
Though the scope and dimensions of globalization as most people currently construe it are of fairly recent origin, the broader phenomenon of global interconnections through cultural diffusion and trade is several centuries old. Starting in the late Fifteenth century, European powers expanded beyond the European sub-continent to found colonies in the Americas, East Asia, South Asia, Australia and Oceania. This expansion has had a profound impact in terms of wealth creation in Europe and extraction elsewhere, cultural changes in most of the world’s societies, and biological phenomena such as the introduction of several infectious diseases into the [[Western Hemisphere]], which caused tremendous disruption and population reduction for indigenous societies there. These events, far from occurring coincidentally, have had synergistic relationships, in one vivid example, the decimation of [[Amerindian]] populations through infectious disease often preceding and facilitating subsequent conquest by European powers. Such conquests in turn have often had significantly negative impacts on internal cohesion, ability of populations to attain adequate resources for their own subsistence and traditional social obligations, and local environments for colonized societies. In order to understand the effects of globalization on nutritional status and food security, it is important to understand the historical circumstances that have led to contemporary globalization, and that still manifest themselves in political, social, material, and physical/health differentials between (and within) the different peoples of the world today.
 
“The Rise of the Merchant, Industrialist, and Capital Controller,” written by Richard Robbins in 2005, uses a hypothetical scenario of the reader as a “merchant adventurer” to detail economic world history starting in 1400. In 1400, China was arguably the most cosmopolitan and technologically complex society in the world. It was a center of trade, along with the Middle East, East Africa, and ports on the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Western Europe, while playing a part in this network, did not dominate it by any means; one could argue for European marginalization in fact. This circumstance began to change when the Europeans “discovered” the Americas, setting in motion a process that would disrupt many societies and devastate indigenous populations of the Western Hemisphere. The dominant economic paradigm of this period was [[mercantilism]], whereby European merchants began to achieve power in world markets and in relation to European governing aristocracies. Robbins cites example of government protections that facilitated mercantilism in the form of exclusive proprietary rights to trading companies and armies used to protect trade by force if necessary. He details instances of government protection such as the example of how Great Britain destroyed India's textile industry and turned that society into an importer of textiles is especially illustrative. In dealing with [[imperialism]], capitalism, and the rise of corporations, Robins further details the manner in which the “West” transformed various regions/peoples from proactive participants on global trade networks into sources of raw materials and consumers of European or [[North American]] exports. This history of world trade is important to the consideration of current issues of disparity of power and wealth.
 
There are many critiques the policies of the [[World Bank]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) in the promotion of high intensity capital investment in developing nations (e.g. Weller et al. 2001; Fort et al. 2004). Disparities within nations and growing poverty rates in many nations also provide compelling evidence of the idea that the rewards of [[economic globalization]] are uneven at best. There is a great deal of literature about globalization and increases in health disparities both between and within countries.
 
Finally, there is [[Amartya Sen]] with ''[[Development as Freedom]]'' (1999); here Sen disagrees about whether or not the world’s poor are getting poorer, but also maintains that this criterion is not the most important. He argues that relative disparities and power differentials are the most important problems of globalization. Sen states that the increasing interconnection of the Worlds societies can have positive benefits, but that the disparities and opportunities for exploitation must be mitigated to the greatest extent possible, if they can not be eliminated outright. Sen provides groundwork for a nuanced middle ground between unabashed proponents and opponents of globalization. 
 
Far from being universally decried, the recent accelerated expansion of western capitalism, geographically, politically, and ideologically, has been lauded in many quarters. International and bilateral agencies such as the World Bank, IMF, and the [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) have utilized free market capitalist theories extensively in development programs in many corners of the globe whose state aims are to promote economic growth for communities and nation-states and to alleviate poverty. Likewise prominent individuals such as former [[U.S. Federal Reserve Board]] Chair [[Alan Greenspan]] and U.S. based journalist [[Thomas Friedman]] have held forth extensively about the possibilities of economic and social improvement in developed and developing nations alike, mainly through increased access to appropriate education, sophisticated communications and transportation technology, and a paradigm of social and economic “flexibility”, where individuals and communities who can best adapt to rapid changes in the role of governments and the particular economic base of a given location would be in the best position to take advantage of the opportunities offered by economic, political, and cultural globalization. This free market ideology is also predominant in the policies and procedures of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) and many transnational corporations (TNC’s), most of which are headquartered in developed nations. The rise of Capitalism and the free market society have indeed increased and exacerbated food insecurity in the world's poor due to the structure and function of a Capitalist society where only those who can afford to buy food to feed themselves are the only ones with access to a secure and adequate food supply. Food is no longer a human right to life and health due to the Capitalist approach to commodifying food in the free market society that as a result of globalization has spread all over the world. Transnational corporations and trade organizations such as NAFTA facilitate this approach of commodifying our world's food supply by enforcing laws and regulations which further deepen the inequality of wealth and unequal distribution of common goods such as food between the rich and the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Health, Wealth and the Environment: the Impacts of the CUSTA, GATT and NAFTA on Canadian Food Security|journal=Toronto Food Policy Council Discussion Paper Series|date=August 1994|issue=Discussion Paper #2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In contrast to the “western” economic model, most early social scholarship about economics stressed the predominance of reciprocity as a primary driving force in traditional non-Western societies. [[Marcel Mauss]] referred to the gift as a “total social phenomenon”, fraught with ritual and socio political as well as material significance. Though some objects, such as armbands or shell necklaces in the kula ring that runs through several island groups off the coast of [[Papua New Guinea]], might induce some form of prestige based competition, the terms of exchange are significantly different than a monetary transaction under a modern capitalist system. While [[Appadurai]] actually describes ritual objects as a type of commodity, he couches them as such under significantly different terms than the market-based types of commodity normally treated by economists. Annette Wiener criticizes earlier works in anthropology and sociology that depicted “simple” societies utilizing a simple version of reciprocity. Whatever the theoretical stance of social scholars on non-western traditional economies, there is a consensus that such essentials as food and water tended to be shared more freely than other types of goods or services. This dynamic tends to change with the introduction of a market-based economy into a society, with food coming to be increasingly treated as a commodity, rather than a social good or an essential component of health and survival.

Regardless of one’s overall perspective on the costs and benefits of economic globalization, there are several examples in social scholarship of groups of people suffering a decline in nutritional statues subsequent to the introduction of a capitalist market-based economy into an area that has previously practiced an economy based more on subsistence production and reciprocity. Although some people’s food security may improve with access to more steady income, many people in communities that have heretofore practiced a [[subsistence economy]] may experienced greater food insecurity and nutritional status due to insufficient income to replace the foods no longer produced by a household. Whether the growth of food insecurity and socioeconomic disparities in many parts of the world in recent decades is an inherent part of globalization or a temporary “growing pain” until economic development attains its full efficacy is a matter of debate, but there are many empirical examples of communities being dissociated from traditional means of food production and not being able to find sufficient wages in a new market economy to achieve a balanced and calorically sufficient diet. Several factors affecting food security and nutritional status range on a continuum from more physical phenomena such as land degradation and land expropriation, to more culturally and socio-politically driven things such as cash cropping, dietary delocalization, and commoditization of food; one important caveat is that all of these trends are interconnected and fall under a broad category of socio-cultural and economic disruptions and dislocations under the current paradigm of globalization.

===Land degradation===
Though Blakie and Brookfield acknowledge the problematic aspects of defining [[land degradation]], with definitional variation depending in large part on the scholar or stakeholder in question, they do outline a general idea of reduced soil fertility and reduced ability of a given area of land to provide for people’s subsistence needs, as compared to earlier periods in human history on that same land area. [[Paul Farmer]] discusses the effects of land degradation in central [[Haiti]] on local people’s ability to produce sufficient food for their families within the environs of their own communities. Farmer links malnutrition in a Haitian village with vulnerability to infectious diseases, including [[tuberculosis]] and [[HIV/AIDS]], both in terms of chance of infection and severity of symptoms for those infected. While the extremely low percentage of the U.S. population involved in agriculture strongly suggests that direct access to arable land is not an absolute necessity for food security and nutritional health, land degradation in many developing nations is accelerating the rate of rural to urban migration at a more accelerated rate than most major cities are equipped to handle. Leatherman and Goodman also allude to land degradation co-occurring with decreases in food security and nutritional status in some communities in the [[Mexican state]] of [[Quintana Roo]]. Walter Edgar discusses the correlation between land degradation and economic disruption, as well as nutritional hardship, in the U.S. state of [[South Carolina]] in the decades following the [[Reconstruction Period]]. Coupled with land expropriation, land degradation has the effect of thrusting unprepared subsistence producers or other peasant farmers into a fast-paced and complex market economy heavily influence by policy makers who are far removed from the concerns and worldview of small scale farmers in developing countries.

===Land expropriation===
Occurring for a variety of reasons, land expropriation, or the disruption of traditional ownership of land by more powerful interests such as local elites, governments, or transnational corporations, can also markedly affect nutritional status. Robbins details examples in Mexico of peasants facing land expropriation in the face of agribusiness consolidation under the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA); in many cases, these subsistence producers are forced either to migrate to cities or work sporadically as agricultural labors. Since most if not all food must be purchased under these circumstances, the food security and nutritional status of these newer additions to the pool of poor unskilled labor often declines. Another common impetus for expropriation is non-agricultural “economic development”, often in the form of tourism. In one Example, Donald MacLeod details curtailment of subsistence activities, mainly fishing and cultivation, in areas of the [[Canary Islands]] in the face of pressures from tourism interests wishing to monopolize the “pristine” beauty of locations catering to Germans and other tourists from EU nations. Ironically, local people see relatively little monetary benefit from the rise in tourism, as many vacations are planned by German tour companies (linked with all inclusive German owned resorts in the Canary Islands) and are paid for before tourists ever arrive at their vacation destination. Leatherman and Goodman and Daltabuit point to circumscription of land available for traditional milpa horticultural production in communities in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo in the face of growing demands for land for resorts by tourism interests, under the auspices of the Mexican national government. One expropriation scenario with a long history is cash cropping, where crops grown for revenue from exports are prioritized over crops grown for local consumption.

===Cash cropping===
In ''[[Sweetness and Power]]'', written by [[Sidney Mintz]] in 1985, details examples of mono-cropping, or planting massive areas with one cash crop, in several Caribbean Islands, including Cuba. He states that Cuba went from being an economically diverse place with many small scale subsistence producers to a mono-crop plantation system dependent on cash from its sugar crop and substantial food imports for the later centuries of the Spanish Colonial Period. He describes Cuba as an example of growing impoverishment and malnutrition concurrent with increasing concentration of land and other resources in fewer hands. Gross and Underwood illustrate the mid Twentieth Century example of the advent of sisal production in [[Northeastern Brazil]]. These authors detail a vicious cycle of the unfulfilled promises of [[sisal]] production for smallholders; because owners of sisal processing machines did not think small farms worth their time, small holders could not process and sell their sisal and were often forced to work as laborers on large farms. Sisal is cited as being particularly insidious because it is hard to eradicate once introduced and makes subsequent subsistence production virtually impossible. This article treats a common situation of households prioritizing working males in food allocation, exposing growing children to malnutrition, particularly under nutrition and micronutrient deficiency, and all of its attendant ills. Edgar discusses how exclusive planting of cotton in the Southeastern United States during the late Nineteenth and early Twentieth Centuries caused substantial land degradation, lead to a great deal of land expropriation from small scale farmers, and occurred in a context of widespread malnutrition. Especially in Today’s complex, accelerated version of globalization, cash cropping is intimately linked with the delocalization of diets and the commoditization of food and has profound, though varied, implications for food security and nutritional status.

===Delocalization and commoditization===
In “Diet and Delocalization: Dietary Challenges since 1750”, Pelto and Pelto trace the concurrent historical development of global capitalism and dietary delocalization, a process in which increasing portions of diet for a household or community come from an increasing distance away from that same community. Nutritional scholars explicitly state that delocalization does not necessarily entail increased food insecurity and malnutrition, but that access to an adequate diet becomes increasingly removed from local control and increasingly contingent on access to hard cash or some other non-food precious resource. Leatherman and Goodman discuss the ironic result of their study in Quintana Roo that both the groups with the best and worst food security and nutritional status worked in service industries related to tourism, with the median group being a milpa community. They differentiate between those with stable employment and income who have access to a wide variety of foods on a regular basis and those with sporadic employment who struggle for caloric sufficiency within the household and have low dietary diversity. The main import of these examples is not that delocalization is universally negative, but that it tends to increase disparities of food security and nutritional status within and between social groups, with some segments suffering marked degradation of both.
 
Closely linked with delocalization is food commoditization, or the treatment of food primarily as a market commodity, rather than prioritizing other uses, such as sustenance, human rights entitlement, or social relations. Dewey describes the deleterious effects of food commoditization for rural communities in Central America, to include reductions in food security and nutritional status. Much of tourism literature details marked increases in the commoditization of food subsequent to the introduction of tourism as a form of market based economic development. Dewey and Robbins also state that when food is primarily seen as a commodity by powerful interests, not only does such an ideology increase delocalization, but also land degradation and expropriation as elite land owners or transnational corporations cause massive social and ecological disruptions in the process of mono-cropping food crops over broad swaths of land in order to reap maximum profits from overseas sales. Indeed, delocalization and commoditization have significant potential to diminish food security and nutritional status in poor communities over broad areas of the world.

===Dietary health===
In terms of food security and dietary diversity, which are defined as reliable access to a caloric sufficiency and access to a wide variety of macro and micro nutrients in order to maintain nutritive balance, respectively, the commoditization of food plays a key role in diminishing the control local populations have over their own subsistence production. Delocalization of food systems, which Pelto and Pelto&lt;ref name= Pelto&gt;Pelto and Pelto (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; define as taking production of food out of a local subsistence context and tying it to geographically broader market systems, can precipitate marked cultural and nutritional disruption. Likewise commoditization of food systems, defined as a paradigm shift from one of subsistence or social significances shift toward one which treats food primarily as a market commodity,&lt;ref name= Dewey&gt;Dewey (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; can affect dietary health as well as collective identity. Commoditization tends to shift food security and dietary diversity away from integrated kinship or other reciprocal distribution networks toward being an issue of who can best compete in a free market to achieve these ends; indeed, commoditization has often been linked to breakdowns in food entitlements, which are defined as cultural or social norms that ensure food access for all members of a given social group.&lt;ref name= leather&gt;Leatherman and Goodman (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= messer&gt;Messer et al. (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

The deleterious effects of mild to moderate [[malnutrition]] (MMM) not only pertain to caloric insufficiency (often closely associated with food insecurity) but also to poor dietary diversity; in particular, curtailed access to protein, complex carbohydrates, zinc, iron, and other micronutrients.&lt;ref name= leather/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crooks (1998) pp.339-355&lt;/ref&gt; The ways in which undernutrition and micronutrient deficiency interact with other health effects are [[myriad]]. The most obvious manifestation of MMM, stunting is defined as height and or weight below the standard range for a particular age group. However, far from being a mere difference in height and weight, stunting was correlated with a wide variety of health effects.&lt;ref&gt;Chavez et al. (2000) pp.237-251&lt;/ref&gt; Closely related to stunting, level of physical activity closely articulates with nutritional status and affects childhood development. Chronically malnourished infants and toddlers showed decreased physical activity compared to supplemented groups or those who are adequately nourished.&lt;ref&gt;Chavez et al. (2000) pp.249-251&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allen (1984) pp.172-173&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps, the most critical facets of human development correlated to nutrition levels are behavior and cognition; development in these two areas could have profound effects on life chances for individuals and populations. In comparing a group of southern Mexican children subject to MMM and a group in the same region who received dietary supplements, Chavez et al.&lt;ref name= Chavez&gt;Chavez et al. (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; show a relation between MMM and poorer school performance; unsupplemented children showed poorer participation, greater degree of in-class distraction, more sleeping in class, and poorer performance on standardized tests. In addition, malnourished children showed poorer scores on [[intelligence quotient]] (I.Q.) tests than their supplemented counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;Chavez et al. (2000) pp.248-249&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Of all the aspects of human existence, [[sexual reproduction]] may have the most detailed articulation with malnutrition. In populations subject to MMM, menarche occurs later (15.5 years) than in adequately nourished populations; an early average [[menopause]] (40.5 years) makes for a relatively short reproductive period for women in the study area for Chavez et al.&lt;ref name= Chavez236&gt;Chavez et al. (2000) pp.236, 239&lt;/ref&gt; Because of longer postpartum periods of [[amenorrhea]], birth spacing was an average of 27 months, versus 19 months.&lt;ref name= Chavez236/&gt; Though longer birth spacing can help control population growth, the evidence that Chavez et al.&lt;ref name= Chavez/&gt; present suggest a curtailing of reproductive choice and adaptability due to malnutrition. This study also linked maternal MMM with higher infant and young child mortality.&lt;ref&gt;Chavez et al. (2000) p.236&lt;/ref&gt;

Another effect of MMM crucial to life chances is work capacity; MMM shows a cyclical pattern of decreasing work capacity and its rewards, further exacerbating the problem. Allen&lt;ref name= Allen/&gt; found a correlation between reduced VO2 max rates among MMM populations and decreased muscular strength and endurance in the performance of strenuous manual labor. Although personal motivation can have a strong positive impact on individual work performance, better muscular development associated with a history of adequate nutrition increases overall work capacity, irrespective of effort. Among [[Jamaica]]n cane cutters, those within normal size range cut more cane than those who showed stunting. One cultural variation in this trend was found among MMM [[Guatemala]]n workers who put forth work effort comparable to better nourished counterparts, but were likely to engage in resting behavior than in recreational or social activity during off hours.&lt;ref&gt;Allen (1984) p.173&lt;/ref&gt; In wage economies where workers get paid in proportion to productive output, reduced work capacity can translate to reduced food security, increasing the risk of MMM.
 
Additionally, malnutrition and [[infectious disease]] have a synergistic relationship that can lead to spiraling health deterioration. According to Allen,&lt;ref name= Allen&gt;Allen (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; the incidence of infectious disease does not vary significantly between MMM and adequately nourished populations, but the duration and severity of disease episodes is greater for MMM populations.&lt;ref name= Allen/&gt; A key reason for this disparity is that infectious disease often results in poor food intake and nutrient absorption. Not only do sick people generally eat little, but what they do eat is often of minimal benefit due to nausea and diarrhea.&lt;ref&gt;Allen (1984) p.169&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from MMM due to under-nutrition or micro-nutrient deficiency, over-nutrition, defined as the consumption of too many calories for one’s body size and physical activity level,&lt;ref name= Crooks&gt;Crooks (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; is also becoming an increasingly significant problem for much of the World. [[Overnutrition]] has been associated with obesity, which the USDA&lt;ref name= USDA&gt;USDA (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; and McEwen and Seeman&lt;ref name= McEwen&gt;McEwen and Seeman (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; correlate with increased risk of type II [[diabetes]], [[cardiovascular disease]], and stroke. Overnutrition is also often associated with the co-occurrence of caloric sufficiency (or over-sufficiency) and micronutrient deficiency, as is often the case where processed foods that are high in calories, but low in most nutrients, increase in dietary prominence.&lt;ref name= Crooks/&gt;&lt;ref name= USDA/&gt;&lt;ref name= Evans&gt;Evans (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; Leatherman and Goodman&lt;ref name= leather/&gt; and Guest and Jones&lt;ref name= guest&gt;Guest and Jones (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; discuss the growing coincidence of stunting and other symptoms of MMM and obesity within developing nations, sometimes within the same community. This trend can be linked to changing economies and food practices in much of the World under contemporary economic globalization.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3953">'''PDE surfaces''' are used in [[geometric modelling]] and [[computer graphics]] for creating smooth surfaces conforming to a given boundary configuration. PDE surfaces use [[partial differential equations]] to generate a surface which usually satisfy a mathematical [[boundary value problem]].

PDE surfaces were first introduced into the area of [[geometric modelling]] and [[computer graphics]] by two British mathematicians, Malcolm Bloor and Michael Wilson. 

==Technical details==
The PDE method involves generating a surface for some boundary by means of solving an [[Elliptic operator|elliptic partial differential equation]] of the form

:&lt;math&gt;
\left( \frac{\partial ^{2}}{ \partial
 u^{2}} + a^{2}\frac {\partial^{2}}{\partial v^{2}} \right)^{2}
X(u,v) = 0.
&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;X(u,v) &lt;/math&gt; is a function parameterised by the two [[parameter]]s &lt;math&gt; u &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;X(u,v) = (x(u,v), y(u,v), z(u,v)) &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; y &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; z &lt;/math&gt; are the usual [[Cartesian coordinate system|cartesian coordinate]] space. The boundary conditions on the function &lt;math&gt;X(u,v) &lt;/math&gt; and its 
normal derivatives &lt;math&gt; \partial{X}/\partial{{n}} &lt;/math&gt;  
are imposed at the edges of the surface patch.

With the above formulation it is notable that the elliptic partial differential operator in the above PDE represents a smoothing process in which the value of the function at any point on the surface is, in some sense, a weighted average of the surrounding 
values. In this way a surface is obtained as a smooth transition between 
the chosen set of [[boundary condition]]s.  The parameter &lt;math&gt; a &lt;/math&gt; is a special design parameter which controls the relative smoothing of the surface in the &lt;math&gt; u &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt; directions.

When &lt;math&gt; a=1 &lt;/math&gt;, the PDE is the [[biharmonic equation]]: &lt;math&gt; X_{uuuu} + 2X_{uuvv} + X_{vvvv}=0 &lt;/math&gt;.  The biharmonic equation is the equation produced by applying the [[Euler–Lagrange equation|Euler-Lagrange equation]] to the simplified [[thin plate energy functional]] &lt;math&gt; X_{uu}^2 + 2X_{uv}^2 + X_{vv}^2 &lt;/math&gt;.  So solving the PDE with &lt;math&gt; a=1 &lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to minimizing the thin plate energy functional subject to the same boundary conditions.

==Applications==
PDE surfaces can be used in many application areas. These include [[computer-aided design]], interactive design,  parametric design, [[computer animation]], computer-aided physical analysis and design optimisation.

'''Pinkney Near''' (1927 - 1990)  was curator of the [[Cincinnati Museum of Art]] and afterward curator of the [[Virginia Museum of Fine Arts]] for thirty years. He was responsible for the [[VMFA]]'s acquisition of many treasured works of art, including arranging for the museum to purchase from [[John Lee Pratt]] the [[Francisco Goya]] portrait of General Nicolas Guye&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Merritt|first1=Robert|title=Pinkney Near Left a Mark on the Museum|publisher=Richmond Time-Dispatch|date=September 30, 1990|location=Richmond, Virginia|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barriault|first1=Anne B.|title=Enrich collections: the extraordinary collections of the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts|publisher=Apollo on High Beam|date=May 1, 2010|quote=...colleagues from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Museum of Art, Dumbarton Oaks, and the American Museum of Natural History . . . consulted with [visionary director Leslie Cheek, Jr.] and curator Pinkney Near to establish the Asian, Ancient Egyptian, Greek Roman, Byzantine, and Pre-Columbian collections.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from the collection of [[Karol Lanckoroński|Count Karol Lanckoroński]] of Vienna, Austria, a rare marble [[sarcophagus]] dating to the 2nd century B.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rare Marble Funeral Monument Given to Museum|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/4653261/sarcophagus_2nd-century_to_vmfa_says/|website=Newspapers.com|accessdate=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Guye portrait was long believed to be the most valuable single work of art in the [[VMFA]]'s collection. The Goya portrait of General Guye is on view prominently in the posthumously created Pinkney Near Gallery at the [[VMFA]]. 
==Biography==

Pinkney Near was born in New York City and was raised in [[Baltimore, Maryland]].&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituary: Pinkney L. Near|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1990-09-20/news/1990263193_1_pinkney-paul-episcopal-church-rebecca-n|accessdate=26 October 2015|publisher=Baltimore Sun|date=September 20, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944 he graduated from [[St. Paul's School (Brooklandville, Maryland)|St. Paul's School]], and in 1950 he became the first art history graduate of [[Johns Hopkins University]]. He earned his Master's degree from Harvard in 1951, and he studied [[Romanesque art|French Romanesque]] sculpture in Paris for three years on a [[Fulbright scholarship]]. He remained in Europe an additional year for research on a Sachs fellowship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Merritt|first1=Robert|title=Pinkney Near left mark on museum|publisher=Richmond Times-Dispatch|date=September 30, 1990|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He married the former Henrietta Lloyd.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1990-09-20/news/1990263193_1_pinkney-paul-episcopal-church-rebecca-n&lt;/ref&gt; Every summer Near, a specialist in European art,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Library|first1=VMFA|title=Special Collections in European Art: The Pinkney Near Collection|url=http://vmfa.museum/library/collections/|website=Virginia Museum of Fine Arts|accessdate=6 January 2016|location=Richmond, Virginia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his artist wife Henrietta Lloyd Near, a former colleague at the [[VMFA]], traveled to Europe to acquire art for the [[Virginia Museum of Fine Arts]]. Among the cities they visited were Barcelona, London, Rome, and Venice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=People in the Fan: Henrietta Near|publisher=Fan District Newsletter|date=Summer 2015|location=Richmond, Virginia|pages=8, 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were sometimes accompanied by philanthropists [[Sydney Lewis|Sydney and Frances Lewis]], donors of major collections to the museum.

Near began his work at the [[VMFA]] in 1958, and, except for three years (1962-1965) when he did graduate work at [[Harvard]] and was a curator at the [[Cincinnati Art Museum]], he served at the VMFA in Richmond the remainder of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Merritt|first1=Robert|title=Curator left lasting mark|work=art critic|issue=March 30, 1990|publisher=Richmond Times-Dispatch|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early years, when the museum was run by a director and a curator with a small staff, Near became the first full-time curator of the [[Virginia Museum of Fine Arts]], one of the first state-supported art museums in the United States.

Pinkney Near died August 29, 1990 of pneumonia at a hospital in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], where he and his wife were visiting relatives. He was 63. His memorial service was held at [[St. Paul's Episcopal Church, Richmond, Virginia|St. Paul's Episcopal Church]] in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond,Virginia]], where he lived.&lt;ref name=obit /&gt;

==Curator of the [[Cincinnati Museum of Art]]==
In 1964 Pinkney Near, curator of paintings, selected American paintings for the Cincinnati Museum's survey exhibition, ranging from early painters such as [[John Trumbull]], [[Gilbert Stuart]], and [[Washington Allston]] to later painters [[John Marin]], [[Max Weber]], [[George Bellows]], [[Childe Hassam]], [[Robert Vickrey]], [[Marsden Hartley]], [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]], [[Mark Tobey]], [[Jane Freilicher]], [[Milton Avery]], and [[Tom Wesselmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Darrack|first1=Arthur|title=American Painting Surveyed in Great Style at Museum Show|website=Newspapers.com|publisher=Cincinnati Enquirer|location=Cincinnati Enquirer, Kentucky edition|page=80|date=April 5, 1964|quote=He [Pinkney Near] has done a superb job of selection and I cannot recall a more interesting panorama of American painting.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Curator of the [[Virginia Museum of Fine Arts]]==
Pinkney Near first came to the VMFA in 1954 for a brief visit, when he had just returned from Paris where he studied Romanesque sculpture with his Fulbright Scholarship. A year later, in 1955 he left the museum for a Sachs fellowship which sponsored further study in Europe. However, it was during this brief stay that he began the evolution of the Collections Division, and, when he returned in 1956 at the age of 29, he became curatorial assistant at the museum. Two years later he was promoted to curator but decided to pursue his graduate work at Harvard. When he returned, he became Chief Curator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hiring of chief curator marked start of Collections Division|publisher=Richmond Times-Dispatch|date=January 12, 1986|location=Richmond, Virginia|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pinkney Near served as VMFA curator for 30 years, much of that time as chief administrative curator. In 1988 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Va. Museum chooses curator for Mellon Collection|publisher=The Richmond Afro-American|date=December 24, 1988|location=Richmond, Virginia|page=A6|quote="In selecting Mr. Near to be the first holder of this prestigious title, Mr. Mellon has recognized Mr. Near's lifelong commitment to scholarship and connoisseurship," says Paul N. Perrot, director of the museum.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Near was named to the newly created post of Paul Mellon Curator and senior research curator, a post in which he worked closely with the Mellon Collection and with [[Paul Mellon]], who provided important gifts of art, both paintings and sculpture portraying animals, to the museum.&lt;ref&gt;Richmond Times-Dispatch, September 30, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1990-09-20/news/1990263193_1_pinkney-paul-episcopal-church-rebecca-n&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the years Near acquired for the museum some of its greatest treasures, including paintings by [[Théodore Géricault]], [[Claude Lorraine]]'s "Battle on a Bridge," [[Aristide Maillol]]'s "The River," [[Claude Monet]]'s "Irises by the Pond," [[Charles Willson Peale]]'s "William Smith and His Grandson," [[Angelica Kauffmann]]'s "Cornelia Pointing to Her Children as Her Treasures," and [[Jean-Baptiste Belin|Jean-Bapiste Blin de Fontenay]]'s monumental "Buffet Under a Trellis."

In 1976 Near announced the [[VMFA|VMFA's]] purchase of American sculptor [[Isamu Noguchi|Isamu Noguchi's]] polished stainless steel sculpture "Open Lock," completed in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Virginia Museum Acquires Sculpture by Isamu Noguchi|publisher=The Danville Register|date=August 9, 1976|location=Danville, Virginia|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the exhibits curated by Near was one called ''Three Masters of Landscape: Fragonard, Robert and Boucher'' which, although small, presented interesting issues due to the variability of the works. The exhibit made use of a recently acquired Fragonard entitled ''Landscape With Three Washerwomen".&lt;ref name=nyt1981&gt;{{cite news |title=Gallery View; THREE FRENCH LANDSCAPISTS WITH A COMMON VISION; RICHMOND, Va.|publisher=New York Times|date=November 29, 1981|first=John |last=Russell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and publications==
Pinkney Near wrote ''The Whistlers:A Family Reunion'', published in 1965 by the [[Cincinnati Museum of Art]], followed in 1981 by ''Three Masters of Landscape: Fragonard, Robert, and Boucher'', which was published by the [[Virginia Museum of Fine Arts]]. While at the [[VMFA]], the museum also published his book ''Apollo''. In 1985, his book ''French Paintings'' was published by the [[University of Virginia Press]].

Near, along with two other art experts, [[Julien Binford]] (professor emeritus at [[Mary Washington College]] in [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]]) and William Campbell (Curator of American Paintings at the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington) selected the paintings by the deceased artist [[Gari Melchers]] for permanent display in the Gari Melchers Memorial Gallery at Belmont, the [[Falmouth, Virginia]] home of the artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Culbertson|first1=Drena|title=Final Melchers Collection selection is due this week|publisher=The Free Lance Star|date=July 26, 1976|location=Fredericksburg, Virginia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was an author of many of the VMFA exhibition catalogs and illustrated books including ''French Paintings: The Collection of Mr. and Mrs. Paul Mellon''.

==Pinkney Near memorial lectures in art history==
Following the death of Pinkney Near in 1990 a series of memorial lectures in art history featuring notable art historians was begun at [[Art6|Art6 Gallery]] in Richmond in his honor. All but the last of the series was presented in the main gallery at Art6. Speakers in the series included Mia Genoni, Suzanne Foley, [[Robert Hobbs]], Matthew Affron, Richard Woodward, Joseph Dye III, Mitchell Merling, Belle Pendleton, and Susanne Kilgore Arnold. The final lecture in the series was given by then [[VMFA]] curator of contemporary art [[John Ravenal|John B. Ravenal]] at the [[Virginia Museum of Fine Arts]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art6 Presents|url=http://www.richmondpubliclibrary.org/calendar_more.asp?calendarID=2260|website=Richmond Public Library|accessdate=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; now director at the [[DeCordova Museum and Sculpture Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ravenal|first1=John|title=Curating Jasper Johns+Edvard Munch|url=https://vimeo.com/171099523|website=Vimeo|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Planetary science''' or, more rarely, '''planetology''', is the scientific study of [[planet]]s (including [[Earth]]), [[Natural satellite|moons]], and [[planetary system]]s (in particular those of the [[Solar System]]) and the processes that form them. It studies objects ranging in size from [[micrometeoroid]]s to [[gas giant]]s, aiming to determine their composition, dynamics, formation, interrelations and history. It is a strongly [[interdisciplinary]] field, originally growing from [[astronomy]] and [[earth science]],&lt;ref name="Taylor1994"/&gt; but which now incorporates many disciplines, including [[planetary geology]] (together with [[geochemistry]] and [[geophysics]]), [[cosmochemistry]], [[atmospheric science]], [[oceanography]], [[hydrology]], [[theoretical planetary science]], [[glaciology]], and [[exoplanetology]].&lt;ref name="Taylor1994"&gt;{{cite journal

There are interrelated observational and theoretical branches of planetary science. Observational research can involve a combination of [[space exploration]], predominantly with [[robotic spacecraft]] missions using [[remote sensing]], and comparative, experimental work in Earth-based laboratories. The theoretical component involves considerable [[computer simulation]] and mathematical modelling.

Planetary scientists are generally located in the astronomy and physics or Earth sciences departments of universities or research centres, though there are several purely planetary science institutes worldwide. There are several major conferences each year, and a wide range of [[academic journal|peer-reviewed journals]]. In the case of some exclusive planetary scientists, many of whom are in relation to the study of dark matter, they will seek a private research centre and often initiate partnership research tasks.

==History==
The history of planetary science may be said to have begun with the Ancient Greek philosopher [[Democritus]], who is reported by [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]] as saying &lt;blockquote&gt;The ordered worlds are boundless and differ in size, and that in some there is neither sun nor moon, but that in others, both are greater than with us, and yet with others more in number. And that the intervals between the ordered worlds are unequal, here more and there less, and that some increase, others flourish and others decay, and here they come into being and there they are eclipsed. But that they are destroyed by colliding with one another. And that some ordered worlds are bare of animals and plants and all water.&lt;ref name="Philosophumena"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hippolytus (Antipope) |author2=Origen |others=Translation by Francis Legge, F.S.A.|title=Philosophumena|publisher=Society for promoting Christian knowledge|location=Original from Harvard University.|date=1921|volume=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0lrDy9nn1doC&amp;printsec=titlepage|accessdate=22 May 2009|type=Digitized 9 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In more modern times, planetary science began in astronomy, from studies of the unresolved planets. In this sense, the original planetary astronomer would be [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], who discovered the four largest moons of [[Jupiter]], the mountains on the [[Moon]], and first observed the [[rings of Saturn]], all objects of intense later study. Galileo's study of the lunar mountains in 1609 also began the study of extraterrestrial landscapes: his observation "that the Moon certainly does not possess a smooth and polished surface" suggested that it and other worlds might appear "just like the face of the Earth itself".&lt;ref name="Taylor1994b"&gt;{{cite journal

|doi=10.1038/369196a0
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances in telescope construction and instrumental resolution gradually allowed increased identification of the atmospheric and surface details of the planets. The Moon was initially the most heavily studied, as it always exhibited details on its surface, due to its proximity to the Earth, and the technological improvements gradually produced more detailed lunar geological knowledge. In this scientific process, the main instruments were astronomical [[optical telescope]]s (and later [[radio telescopes]]) and finally robotic exploratory [[space probe|spacecraft]].

The Solar System has now been relatively well-studied, and a good overall understanding of the formation and evolution of this planetary system exists. However, there are large numbers of unsolved questions,&lt;ref name="SternPlanetarySoc09"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00001956/|title=Ten Things I Wish We Really Knew In Planetary Science|last=Stern|first=Alan|accessdate=2009-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the rate of new discoveries is very high, partly due to the large number of interplanetary spacecraft currently exploring the Solar System.

==Disciplines==

===Planetary astronomy===
This is both an observational and a theoretical science. Observational researchers are predominantly concerned with the study of the small bodies of the Solar System: those that are observed by telescopes, both optical and radio, so that characteristics of these bodies such as shape, spin, surface materials and weathering are determined, and the history of their formation and evolution can be understood.

Theoretical planetary astronomy is concerned with [[Analytical dynamics|dynamics]]: the application of the principles of [[celestial mechanics]] to the Solar System and [[extrasolar planet]]ary systems.

=== Planetary geology ===
{{main|Planetary geology}}
{{see also|Geology of solar terrestrial planets|Icy moon}}

The best known research topics of planetary geology deal with the planetary bodies in the near vicinity of the Earth: the [[Moon]], and the two neighbouring planets: [[Venus]] and [[Mars]]. Of these, the Moon was studied first, using methods developed earlier on the Earth.

==== Geomorphology ====
{{main|Geomorphology}}

Geomorphology studies the features on planetary surfaces and reconstructs the history of their formation, inferring the physical processes that acted on the surface. Planetary geomorphology includes the study of several classes of surface features:
* Impact features (multi-ringed basins, craters)
* Volcanic and tectonic features (lava flows, fissures, [[rille]]s)
* [[Space weathering]] - erosional effects generated by the harsh environment of space (continuous micro meteorite bombardment, high-energy particle rain, [[impact gardening]]). For example, the thin dust cover on the surface of the [[moon|lunar]] [[regolith]] is a result of micro meteorite bombardment.
* Hydrological features: the liquid involved can range from water to [[hydrocarbon]] and [[ammonia]], depending on the location within the Solar System.

The history of a planetary surface can be deciphered by mapping features from top to bottom according to their [[Law of superposition|deposition sequence]], as first determined on terrestrial [[stratum|strata]] by [[Nicolas Steno]]. For example, [[Stratigraphy|stratigraphic mapping]] prepared the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] astronauts for the field geology they would encounter on their lunar missions. Overlapping sequences were identified on images taken by the [[Lunar Orbiter program]], and these were used to prepare a lunar [[stratigraphic column]] and [[geologic map|geological map]] of the Moon.
{{further|Geology of the Moon}}

====Cosmochemistry, geochemistry and petrology====
{{main|Cosmochemistry|Geochemistry|Petrology}}

One of the main problems when generating hypotheses on the formation and evolution of objects in the Solar System is the lack of samples that can be analysed in the laboratory, where a large suite of tools are available and the full body of knowledge derived from terrestrial geology can be brought to bear. Direct samples from the Moon, [[asteroid]]s and [[Mars]] are present on Earth, removed from their parent bodies and delivered as [[meteorite]]s. Some of these have suffered contamination from the [[oxidise|oxidising]] effect of Earth's atmosphere and the infiltration of the [[biosphere]], but those meteorites collected in the last few decades from [[Antarctica]] are almost entirely pristine.

The different types of meteorites that originate from the [[asteroid belt]] cover almost all parts of the structure of [[planetary differentiation|differentiated]] bodies: meteorites even exist that come from the core-mantle boundary ([[pallasite]]s). The combination of geochemistry and observational astronomy has also made it possible to trace the [[HED meteorite]]s back to a specific asteroid in the main belt, [[4 Vesta]].

The comparatively few known [[Martian meteorites]] have provided insight into the geochemical composition of the Martian crust, although the unavoidable lack of information about their points of origin on the diverse Martian surface has meant that they do not provide more detailed constraints on theories of the evolution of the Martian [[lithosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uwyo.edu&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 24, 2013 65 samples of Martian meteorites have been discovered on Earth. Many were found in either Antarctica or the Sahara Desert.

During the Apollo era, in the [[Apollo program]], 384 kilograms of [[lunar sample]]s were collected and transported to the Earth, and 3 [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Luna programme|Luna]] robots also delivered [[regolith]] samples from the Moon. These samples provide the most comprehensive record of the composition of any Solar System body beside the Earth. The numbers of lunar meteorites are growing quickly in the last few years –&lt;ref&gt;{curator.jsc.nasa.gov/antmet/lmc/lmcintro.pdf}&lt;/ref&gt; as of
April 2008 there are 54 meteorites that have been officially classified as lunar.
Eleven of these are from the US Antarctic meteorite collection, 6 are from the Japanese
Antarctic meteorite collection, and the other 37 are from hot desert localities in Africa,
Australia, and the Middle East. The total mass of recognized lunar meteorites is close to
50&amp;nbsp;kg.

====Geophysics====
{{main|Geophysics|Space physics}}
Space probes made it possible to collect data in not only the visible light region, but in other areas of the electromagnetic spectrum. The planets can be characterized by their force fields: gravity and their magnetic fields, which are studied through geophysics and space physics.

Measuring the changes in acceleration experienced by spacecraft as they orbit has allowed fine details of the [[gravity field]]s of the planets to be mapped. For example, in the 1970s, the gravity field disturbances above [[lunar maria]] were measured through lunar orbiters, which led to the discovery of concentrations of mass, [[Mass concentration (astronomy)|mascons]], beneath the Imbrium, Serenitatis, Crisium, Nectaris and Humorum basins.
[[File:Magnetosphere rendition.jpg|right|thumb|The [[solar wind]] is deflected by the magnetosphere (not to scale)]]
If a planet's [[magnetic field]] is sufficiently strong, its interaction with the solar wind forms a [[magnetosphere]] around a planet. Early space probes discovered the gross dimensions of the terrestrial magnetic field, which extends about 10 Earth radii towards the Sun. The [[solar wind]], a stream of charged particles, streams out and around the terrestrial magnetic field, and continues behind the magnetic tail, hundreds of Earth radii downstream. Inside the magnetosphere, there are relatively dense regions of solar wind particles, the [[Van Allen radiation belt]]s.

Geophysics includes [[seismology]] and [[tectonophysics]], [[geophysical fluid dynamics]], [[mineral physics]], [[geodynamics]], [[mathematical geophysics]], and [[geophysical surveying]].

{{anchor|planetary geodesy}}&lt;!-- used by incoming redirect --&gt;
Planetary [[geodesy]], (also known as planetary geodetics) deals with the measurement and representation of the planets of the Solar System, their [[gravitation]]al fields and geodynamic phenomena ([[polar motion]] in three-dimensional, time-varying space. The science of geodesy has elements of both astrophysics and planetary sciences. The shape of the Earth is to a large extent the result of its rotation, which causes its equatorial bulge, and the competition of geologic processes such as the collision of plates and of [[Volcano|vulcanism]], resisted by the Earth's [[gravity]] field. These principles can be applied to the solid surface of Earth ([[orogeny]]; Few mountains are higher than {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}}, few deep sea trenches deeper than that because quite simply, a mountain as tall as, for example, {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=on}}, would develop so much [[pressure]] at its base, due to gravity, that the rock there would become [[plastic]], and the mountain would slump back to a height of roughly {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} in a geologically insignificant time. Some or all of these geologic principles can be applied to other planets besides Earth. For instance on Mars, whose surface gravity is much less, the largest volcano, [[Olympus Mons]], is {{convert|27|km|0|abbr=on}} high at its peak, a height that could not be maintained on Earth. The Earth [[geoid]] is essentially the figure of the Earth abstracted from its topographic features. Therefore, the Mars geoid is essentially the figure of Mars abstracted from its topographic features. [[Surveying]] and [[map]]ping are two important fields of application of geodesy.

===Atmospheric science===
{{main|Atmospheric science|Global climate model}}
[[File:Jupiter.jpg|right|thumb|Cloud bands clearly visible on [[Jupiter]]. ]]
The [[atmosphere]] is an important transitional zone between the solid planetary surface and the higher rarefied [[Ionisation|ionizing]] and radiation belts. Not all planets have atmospheres: their existence depends on the mass of the planet, and the planet's distance from the Sun&amp;nbsp;— too distant and frozen atmospheres occur. Besides the four [[gas giant]] planets, almost all of the [[terrestrial planets]] ([[Earth's atmosphere|Earth]], [[Atmosphere of Venus|Venus]], and [[Atmosphere of Mars|Mars]]) have significant atmospheres. Two moons have significant atmospheres: [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] and [[Neptune]]'s moon [[Atmosphere of Triton|Triton]]. A tenuous atmosphere exists around [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]].

The effects of the [[Planet#Rotation|rotation rate]] of a planet about its axis can be seen in atmospheric streams and currents. Seen from space, these features show as bands and eddies in the cloud system, and are particularly visible on Jupiter and Saturn.

==Comparative planetary science==

{{main|Comparative planetary science}}

Planetary science frequently makes use of the method of comparison to give a greater understanding of the object of study. This can involve comparing the dense atmospheres of Earth and Saturn's moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], the evolution of outer Solar System objects at different distances from the Sun, or the geomorphology of the surfaces of the terrestrial planets, to give only a few examples.

The main comparison that can be made is to features on the Earth, as it is much more accessible and allows a much greater range of measurements to be made. Earth analogue studies are particularly common in planetary geology, geomorphology, and also in atmospheric science.

'''Policy monitoring''' comprises a range of activities describing and analyzing the development and implementation of policies, identifying potential gaps in the process, outlining areas for improvement, and holding policy implementers accountable for their activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hardee|first=Karen|author2=Laili Irani |author3=Ron MacInnis |author4=Matthew Hamilton |title=Linking Health Policy With Health Systems And Health Outcomes|journal=Washington DC: Futures Group, Health Policy Project|year=2012|url=http://www.healthpolicyproject.com/pubs/186_HealthPolicySystemOutcomesConceptualALDec.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
Monitoring policy development and implementation is an integral component of the [[policy cycle]] and can be applied in sectors including agriculture, health, education, and finance. Policy monitoring can improve policy information, collaboration among stakeholders, and the use of evaluation techniques to provide feedback to reframe and revise policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wong|first=Cecilia|author2=Craig Watkins|title=Conceptualizing Spatial Planning Outcomes: Towards an Integrative Measurement Framework|journal=The Town Planning Review|year=2009|volume=80|issue=4/5|url=https://www.questia.com/library/1P3-1899476771/conceptualising-spatial-planning-outcomes-towards}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Waterman and Wood derived policy monitoring from [[agency theory]], describing a process where policymakers monitor the actions of their bureaucratic agents who implement and enforce policies. This monitoring allows policymakers to compensate for their agents’ greater knowledge of the policy process, and enables them to be well-informed decision makers. Thus policy monitoring allows policymakers and interested actors to systematically examine the process of creating a policy, implementing it, and evaluating its effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Waterman|first=Richard|author2=Dan Wood|title=Policy Monitoring and Policy Analysis|journal=Journal of Policy Analysis and Management|year=1993|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2307/3325346/abstract|doi=10.2307/3325346|volume=12|pages=685}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Policy monitoring activities can be used to collect and analyze data related to the development and implementation of specific policies. It can also help link policies to specific outcomes and  help identify and evaluate policy impacts. Policy impacts can include specific changes in behavior (e.g., increased number of people wearing seatbelts), finances (e.g., increased tax revenue), health status or epidemiology (e.g., reduced number of new HIV infections) or other social indicators (e.g., reduced crime rates, reduced levels of pollution). Data from policy monitoring can be used to support advocacy efforts and guide the development of new, timely, and relevant policies. Policy monitoring should also include the identification of operational policy barriers that can be addressed through policy and program reform, and findings can support improved implementation of existing policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hardee|first=Karen|author2=Laili Irani |author3=Ron MacInnis |author4=Matthew Hamilton |title=Linking Health Policy With Health Systems And Health Outcomes|journal=Washington DC: Futures Group, Health Policy Project|year=2012|url=http://www.healthpolicyproject.com/pubs/186_HealthPolicySystemOutcomesConceptualALDec.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Challenges ==
Numerous actors and stakeholders can influence the movement of policy from inception to implementation. Well-maintained documentation and review of all key stakeholders involved in a policy can help advocates for a given policy—such as military reform, water rights, or disability legislation—prepare to address different ideologies, capacities, or interests of key actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=Harry|title=A Guide to Monitoring and Evaluating Policy Influence|journal=Overseas Development Institute|date=February 2011|url=http://www.odi.org.uk/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/publications-opinion-files/6453.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Limiting stakeholder analysis only to government and official policymakers may ignore major groups that can support policy development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hardee|first=Karen|author2=Imelda Feranil |author3=Jill Boezwinkle |author4=Benjamin Clark Benjamin |title=The Policy Circle: A Framework For Analyzing the Components of Family Planning, Reproductive Health, Maternal Health, and HIV/AIDS Policies|journal=Washington DC: Futures Group, Policy Project|year=2004|url=http://www.policyproject.com/pubs/workingpapers/wps-11.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Policy monitoring coalitions should agree on what they are monitoring and be succinct in their recommendations to policymakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wong|first=Cecilia|author2=Craig Watkins|title=Conceptualizing Spatial Planning Outcomes: Towards an Integrative Measurement Framework|journal=The Town Planning Review|year=2009|volume=80|issue=4/5|url=https://www.questia.com/library/1P3-1899476771/conceptualising-spatial-planning-outcomes-towards}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Policy initiatives themselves are often controversial, and policy monitoring can be contentious because it shows how well policy implementers and enforcers are doing their jobs. Those conducting policy monitoring should be thorough in their data collection and unbiased in their presentation of facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wood|first=Dan|title=The Dynamics of Political Control of the Bureaucracy|journal=The American Political Science Review|year=1991|volume=85|issue=3|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1963851?uid=3739584&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21102625842527}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Robust trainings on policy monitoring work can help organizations be systematic and effective in their policy monitoring efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=Harry|title=A Guide to Monitoring and Evaluating Policy Influence|journal=Overseas Development Institute|date=February 2011|url=http://www.odi.org.uk/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/publications-opinion-files/6453.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Existing Models and Frameworks for Policy and Advocacy Monitoring ==
=== PEPFAR ===
The [[PEPFAR|United States President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] (PEPFAR)’s Monitoring Policy Reform tool outlines the progression of policy development related to HIV from problem identification to [[Monitoring and Evaluation|monitoring and evaluation]]. The tool supports a relatively simple and uniform monitoring process which can be applied to any policy area. This tool can guide policy monitoring efforts throughout the policy reform process.

 PEPFAR’s six stages of the policy reform process:

:'''Stage 1''': Identify baseline policy issues by conducting situation assessment

:  '''Stage 2''': Engagement of stakeholders in developing common policy agenda

:  '''Stage 3''': Develop policy

:  '''Stage 4''': Official government endorsement of policy

:  '''Stage 5''': Implementation of policy

:  '''Stage 6''': Evaluation of policy implementation (PEPFAR)

=== [[Food and Agriculture Organization]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=FAPDA|journal=Food and Agriculture Organization|year=2013|url=http://www.fao.org/economic/fapda/en/|accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Working Cycle for Country Approach ===
The FAO’s Food and Agriculture Policy Decision Analysis (FAPDA) is a policy monitoring tool that provides a working cycle technique to identify policy problems and improve analysis of policy issues. By incorporating FAPDA outputs, such as a web-based tool, country policy review, and policy analysis report, policy dialogue can be more systematic and encompass different actors interested in FAPDA data.

 The cycle includes:
  Phase 1: Preparatory Phase
  Phase 2: Focal Point Training
  Phase 3: Policy Identification
  Phase 4: Quality Control and Validation
  Phase 5: 1st Discussion Focus of Analysis
  Phase 6: Analysis
  Phase 7: 2nd Discussion on Findings (FAO)

=== World Health Organization ===
The World Health Organization has started to develop dedicated monitoring systems for policy interventions on the social determinants of health that improve health equity, such as social protection and gender equity policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2471/BLT.16.184622 |url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/95/11/16-184622/en/ |title=The need to monitor actions on the social determinants of health |journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization |volume=95 |issue=11 |pages=784-787 |year=2017 |last1=Pega |first1=Frank |last2=Valentine |first2=Nicole |last3=Rasanathan |first3=Kumanan |last4=Hosseinpoor |first4=Ahmad Reza |last5=Neira |first5=Maria }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
  
=== Gender ===
Policy monitoring can be performed through different issue-driven lenses, such as gender sensitivity or gender equality. Gender-sensitive policy monitoring analyzes any gender aspects of a policy or policy issue, and considers the impact of the policy on both men and women, as well as its impact on gender relations. For example, a policy that is shown to have improved the welfare of a household may not necessarily affect all household members positively or equally, and may have even exacerbated gender inequity. Gender-sensitive policy monitoring can help advance gender equity and improve policy implementation. Civil society and other stakeholders can use policy monitoring techniques to systematically gather data on the gender aspects of policies and use these data to influence policymakers to favor  gender-equitable health policies¬¬¬—these processes are essential to facilitating [[gender mainstreaming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Mohga Kamal|title=Enhancing Gender Equity in Health Programmes: Monitoring and Evaluation|journal=Gender and Development|year=2001|volume=9|issue=2|jstor=4030592}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application ==
A 2012 study analyzed planned policy interventions across the 22 publicly accessible PEPFAR Partnership Frameworks to understand how the interventions are related to PEPFAR and country or regional priorities. The study found that “policy monitoring by donors, partner country governments, and civil society stakeholders can help measure whether policy interventions are occurring as planned in order to further HIV prevention, care, and treatment and health system goals and, if not, can point to needed changes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Judice|first=Nicole|title=Monitoring HIV Policy Interventions in PEPFAR Partnership Frameworks|year=2012|volume=presented at Second Global Symposium on Health Systems Research in Beijing, China|url=http://www.healthpolicyproject.com/pubs/152_HSRPoster.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rebecca in Peoria c1880 web c 1880.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Mrs. Dr. Rebecca Keck (1838-1904) in Peoria c1880]]

== Life and career ==

=== Early years ===

The oldest daughter in a large [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] pioneer farming family, Rebecca Keck ([[née]] Ilgenfritz, sometimes spelled Ilginfritz) was born in [[Wooster, Ohio|Wooster]], [[Wayne County, Ohio]] in 1838.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;''History of Scott Co., Iowa'' Chicago: Inter-State Pub. Co., 1882, pp. 858-861.&lt;/ref&gt;  She moved with her parents to [[Fairfield, Iowa]] at the age of thirteen, where she may have completed schooling as far as the eighth grade.&lt;ref name="State Census"&gt;''Iowa State Census'' July 3, 1854.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1857, she married John Conrad Keck, a merchant and mechanic newly arrived in Fairfield from Northampton County, Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="Jefferson County Marriages"&gt;''Jefferson County Iowa Marriages'' page 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three of Rebecca's brothers died of [[tuberculosis]] between 1857 and 1869; while she was nursing them through their illnesses, she also gave birth to six children (five girls and a boy)&lt;ref name="US Census"&gt;''United States Census'' records for 1860, 1870 and 1880.&lt;/ref&gt; and began to develop a reputation among her neighbors as an [[herbalist]].&lt;ref name="Clarke"&gt;James Frederic Clarke, M.D. "A History of Medicine in Jefferson County, Iowa" ''The Journal of the Iowa State Medical Society'' Dec. 1934 and December, 1935. pg. 13&lt;/ref&gt;  During this time, her husband built up a substantial farm equipment and foundry business.&lt;ref name="Report"&gt;''Report of the Iowa State Agricultural Society,'' John R. Shaffer, Secretary. 1866 through 1876.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medical career ===

Following the national banking [[Panic of 1873]], Mr. Keck's foundry business collapsed and the couple began to collect herbs and brew her remedies together, which Rebecca Keck started to sell door to door.&lt;ref name="Journal"&gt;Dr. James Frederic Clarke M.D. ''ibid'' page 29&lt;/ref&gt; Seeking a wider market, in November, 1873, she took out her first advertisement for "Keck's [[Catarrh]]ochesis"  in Dubuque.&lt;ref name="Dubuque"&gt;''[[Dubuque Herald]]'' November 23 to 29, 1873&lt;/ref&gt; Success came very quickly; within three years she was advertising her "Catarrh Cure" heavily in a number of newspapers including the ''[[Telegraph Herald|Dubuque Herald]]'', the ''Davenport Gazette'' and the ''[[Chicago Times]]'' and ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''.

Besides selling her remedies by mail order, she practiced as an "itinerant physician," a common business model for the frontier, because sick people were scattered across long distances and lacked regular access to medical care. She would rent rooms in a local hotel or storefront for visits of two days to two weeks, and take out large advertisements in advance to advise her customers of her upcoming personal consultations. She traveled her entire circuit every two months, so that patients could see her for follow-up treatment. At its height, her practice served between 12,000 and 15,000 patients, and she would typically see 350 patients per week.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;

[[File:Flyer1894.jpg|thumb|The first page of a 4-page booklet describing Mrs. Dr. Keck's medical services, published in 1894.]]

Mrs. Dr. Keck moved her family to [[Davenport, Iowa]], on the Mississippi River, in 1875 as her business expanded.&lt;ref name="Finger's"&gt;''Finger's Davenport Business Directory for 1876''&lt;/ref&gt; As was common for Midwestern women physicians in her day, she used both Dr &amp; Mrs so that her married and professional status could both be understood by the public. She only treated chronic conditions and according to the testimonial letters she published in her advertising, the majority of her customers were working people and farm families who could not afford the high cost of private doctors' fees and who received her medical remedies and treatment advice by mail order.

Rebecca Keck considered herself to be a fully qualified physician by virtue of her long years of experience treating her family, neighbors and public customers. She owned a large medical library&lt;ref name="will"&gt;Rebecca J. Keck's last will and testament p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; and advertised herself as an Eclectic practitioner. The [[Eclectic medicine|Eclectic School of medicine]], which grew out of the sectarian medical reform movements of the 1830s, was an active and publicly accepted school of medicine in the mid 19th century in the Midwest that competed with [[homeopathy]] and [[Allopathic medicine|allopathic]] (or regular, scientific) medical approaches. Eclectic treatments combined an emphasis on botanical remedies with a willingness to use regular medical techniques in certain cases.

There is no evidence that Rebecca Keck ever graduated from an Eclectic medical school although most of them were open to women by the 1870s. She did not enroll for regular medical training at the University of Iowa's new medical school which opened for men and women in 1871. Either she could not afford the time and money required (because of her six children and her family's bankruptcy in 1873) or she did not consider a professional degree to be necessary for her practice as a physician.

===Fame grows ===

With the exception of [[Lydia Pinkham]], Mrs. Dr. Keck appears to be the only woman to have earned substantial wealth on her own behalf in the lucrative but highly competitive and bruising profession of selling [[patent medicine]] in 19th century America.&lt;ref name="Stage"&gt;Sarah Stage, ''Female Complaints: Lydia Pinkham and the Business of Women's Medicine'' W.W. Norton &amp; Co. 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; Like Mrs. Pinkham, Mrs. Dr. Keck began her career because of family bankruptcy caused by the Panic of 1873. Unlike Mrs. Pinkham, Rebecca Keck not only believed herself to be a practicing physician, but became the top executive of the family's business and ran it herself, with the assistance of her two oldest daughters, Belle Alexander and Charlotte Dorn, while her husband played only a peripheral role and her only son contributed even less to the operations.

It is difficult to know Mrs. Dr. Keck's exact income, but she was able to purchase her infirmary in 1879 for $12,000 in cash,&lt;ref name="Gazette"&gt;''Davenport Gazette'' June 2, 1879, p.2&lt;/ref&gt; and at the time of her death, her life insurance payout of $15,520 was one of the largest made in the United States for the week of May 17, 1905.&lt;ref name="Insurance"&gt;''The Insurance Press'' May 17, 1905&lt;/ref&gt;

While extremely unpopular with members of the medical establishment in Iowa and Illinois, Rebecca Keck enjoyed glowing front page editorial endorsements from newspapers in the cities where she practiced. Some newspapers ran her illustrated, full-column ads on the front page under the heading, "Mrs. Dr. Keck's Column." The ''Decatur Review''&lt;ref name="DecaturReview"&gt;[http://search.ancestry.com/search/db.aspx?dbid=7104 About Decatur Review (Decatur, Illinois)]&lt;/ref&gt; declared on November 15, 1883, "We have a marked example among us of success in medicine, in the person of Mrs. Dr. Keck, well-known in the West," while the ''Bloomington Pantagraph'' declared on August 30, 1883 that Mrs. Dr. Keck "absorbs considerable public attention and is a subject for congratulation among the women of America…a forcible illustration of the ability of women to succeed" in "avenues of professional or public life." The ''Quincy Whig'' said she was "one of our longest established and best known physicians,"&lt;ref name="Whig"&gt;The ''Quincy Whig'' July 21, 1881 page 5&lt;/ref&gt; while the ''Evening Peorian'' referred to her "celebrity as a physician and good name as a citizen."&lt;ref&gt;''Bloomington Daily Leader'' September 24, 1881 page 2&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Peoria National Democrat'' declared, "her success is unprecedented…she is capable of doing the work of five ordinary women."

The regular medical establishment disagreed. The secretary of the Illinois State Board of Health, Dr. John Rauch was quoted in the ''Chicago Tribune'' as saying that Mrs. Dr. Keck was "foul and damnable in every way,"&lt;ref name="Tribune"&gt;''Chicago Daily Tribune'' February 7, 1880, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; and mostly male members of county medical associations were hardly less kind; Dr. James Clarke M.D. of Fairfield averred that the sale of her [[catarrh]] cures "made the doctor wealthy, even if it did not cure her patients."&lt;ref name="Clarke"/&gt; Regular doctors universally dismissed her as a quack, and her name was excluded from the physicians and surgeons listing in the Davenport business directories every year after 1878, although she continued to describe herself as a specialist and physician in the regular alphabetical listings and bought the entire back cover of the 1882 edition to advertise her infirmary.

=== Legal reform ===

The state of Illinois passed its [[Medical Practices Act]] in 1877 in an effort to exert some control of the wholly unregulated medical profession in the state.&lt;ref name="Sandvick"&gt;Clinton Sandvick, Enforcing Medical Licensing in Illinois: 1877-1890  ''Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine''  June 2009; 82(2): 67–74&lt;/ref&gt; This Illinois law was a landmark in [[health law]] in the United States, leading the way towards improved standards for the dismal state of medical licensing and medical education in the country at that time.&lt;ref name="NEJM"&gt;''The New England Journal of Medicine'', known in 1890 as ''The Boston Medical and Surgical Journal'' 122(11): page 257&lt;/ref&gt; The act defined requirements for a [[Medical license|physician's license]] that were extremely loose by modern standards, but which were sufficient to expel thousands of untrained and unqualified physicians and quacks from the state during the first year after it was passed.&lt;ref name="Board of Health 1878"&gt;Illinois State Board of Health, ''First Annual Report of the Illinois State Board of Health, 1878'' Springfield: Weber, Magie and Co. State Printer, 1879&lt;/ref&gt; Popular opposition to this measure was strong, and outraged citizens complained that a law requiring doctors to obtain a license to practice medicine was "an opening wedge for [[socialized medicine]]" in the state.&lt;ref name="Beatty"&gt;William K. Beatty, M.D. (1991) "John H. Rauch—Public Health, Parks and Politics" in ''The Proceedings of the Institute of Medicine of Chicago'' Volume 44 page 107&lt;/ref&gt;

Mrs. Dr. Keck refused to stop treating her patients in Illinois and quickly emerged as one of the most formidable opponents to the state's legal reform effort. As she pushed back against the new governmental regulations, Mrs. Dr. Keck became locked in a highly publicized, adversarial relationship with the secretary of the new Illinois State Board of Health, [[John Henry Rauch|Dr. John H. Rauch M.D.]], that lasted for at least a decade.&lt;ref name="Tribune"/&gt; When local doctors tried to block Mrs. Dr. Keck from practicing in McLean County, Illinois in early 1878, the ''Bloomington Daily Leader'' called hers the first test case of the new legislation, "the beginning of a long and tedious litigation" between the "regulars" and the "irregulars."&lt;ref&gt;''Bloomington Daily Leader'' February 12, 1878 page 4&lt;/ref&gt; The lasting stigma of these accusations was probably an important reason why her accomplishments faded quickly and completely from public view after her death, and her career remains little known today.

Criminal charges were brought against Mrs. Dr. Keck in at least five different counties in Illinois for [[practicing medicine without a license]] between 1878 and 1889, but she was ably defended by her lawyer W. S. McCoy&lt;ref name="champaign"&gt;''The People of Illinois vs. Rebecca Keck'' Case No. 1686, Circuit Court of Champaign County, Ill. March 1886 etc.&lt;/ref&gt; and persisted in business in McLean, Logan, Champaign, Peoria and Adams counties in Illinois for twenty years.&lt;ref name="Review"&gt;''Decatur Review'' February 6, 1884, and hundreds of advertisements in newspapers from those cities&lt;/ref&gt; Iowa's medical legislation had even less effect on her business, and she opened Mrs. Dr. Keck's Infirmary for All Chronic Diseases in Davenport in 1879,&lt;ref name="Gazette"/&gt; practicing with uninterrupted financial success there and in Cedar Rapids, Dubuque and rural communities in Iowa until she retired in 1900.&lt;ref name="Republican"&gt;''Davenport Daily Republican'' July 11, 1900, page 5&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accusations of quackery ===

Over the years, Mrs. Dr. Keck grew more and more boastful of her ability to cure many types of chronic diseases, including tuberculosis, an obviously impossible task in an era before the bacillus that caused the disease had even been identified.  Grateful patients wrote to her when they were cured of chronic lung infections, piles, eczema, general debility, deafness and a host of other issues, and she published their testimonial letters in her advertisements.,&lt;ref&gt;''Davenport Daily Gazette'' Nov. 10, 1881.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="flyer"&gt;''Dr. Mrs.Keck's Medical Infirmary'' a four-page advertising flyer published by Rebecca J. Keck circa 1894, and thousands of advertisements published in newspapers, business directories and gazettes across upper Illinois and eastern Iowa between 1873 and 1900--see Newspaperarchive.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Fraudulent testimonial letters were a common feature of 19th century patent medicine advertising.&lt;ref name="Young"&gt;James Harvey Young, ''The Toadstool Millionaires: A Social History of Patent Medicines in America before Federal Regulation,'' Princeton, NJ: The Princeton University Press, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, United States Census records from 1880 show that many of these people actually existed as presented in print by Mrs. Dr. Keck.&lt;ref name="US Census"/&gt; However, in over a thousand ads that survive to be studied today, less than a hundred different individuals are named, and there is no way to verify the facts presented about their illnesses, particularly the accuracy of the diagnoses, and there is no way to know for sure what percentage of her thousands of other patients did and did not get cured.

Regular allopathic medical practice during the 1870s and 1880s often involved "heroic" treatments with harsh, mineral medications containing lead, mercury (calomel) and arsenic, as well as toxic vegetable compounds containing strychnine, castor oil (derived from ricin), belladonna and other poisonous substances we would consider extremely dangerous today.&lt;ref name="Starr"&gt;Paul Starr, ''The Social Transformation of American Medicine'' Basic Books, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; Clumsy, unsanitary surgical procedures were also common, so it is not impossible that Mrs. Dr. Keck's herbal tonics and sensible nursing advice were actually better for her patients than the regular doctors' remedies in some cases.

It is unlikely that Mrs. Dr. Keck ever hurt anyone. Alert opponents in the medical profession would have been quick to pounce on any provable instance if she had ever actually harmed a patient with her treatments. While a number of outright quacks were taken to court by angry patients seeking reparations for botched treatments in Davenport during the years she practiced, no such accusation against Mrs. Dr. Keck shows up in the public record.&lt;ref name="Alexander"&gt;See for example: ''W.R.Alexander vs. Edward Emerson'' Case No. 1724, District Court of the State of Iowa for Scott County. November 6, 1890 etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

The only parties who sued her during her career were male doctors with M.D. credentials. In every instance, they were seeking to solidify institutional boundaries for their evolving practice of allopathic or scientific medicine by first preventing her from getting a license and second by preventing her from practicing medicine without one. No evidence that she harmed a patient was ever produced in any of these cases.

[[File:Roccurves.png|thumb|right|ROC curve of three predictors of peptide cleaving in the [[proteasome]].]]
A '''receiver operating characteristic curve''', i.e., '''ROC curve''', is a [[graph of a function|graphical plot]] that illustrates the diagnostic ability of a [[binary classifier]] system as its discrimination threshold is varied. 

The ROC curve is created by plotting the [[true positive rate]] (TPR) against the [[false positive rate]] (FPR) at various threshold settings. The true-positive rate is also known as [[Sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]], [[Precision and recall#Definition (classification context)|recall]] or ''probability of detection''&lt;ref name=matlab&gt;{{cite web|title=Detector Performance Analysis Using ROC Curves - MATLAB &amp; Simulink Example|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/phased/examples/detector-performance-analysis-using-roc-curves.html|website=www.mathworks.com|accessdate=11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[machine learning]]. The false-positive rate is also known as the [[Information retrieval#Fall-out|fall-out]] or ''probability of false alarm''&lt;ref name=matlab/&gt; and can be calculated as (1 − [[Specificity (tests)|specificity]]). It can also be thought of as a plot of the [[Statistical power|Power]] as a function of the [[Type I Error]] of the decision rule (when the performance is calculated from just a sample of the population, it can be thought of as estimators of these quantities). The ROC curve is thus the sensitivity as a function of [[Information retrieval#Fall-out|fall-out]]. In general, if the probability distributions for both detection and false alarm are known, the ROC curve can be generated by plotting the [[cumulative distribution function]] (area under the probability distribution from &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; to the discrimination threshold) of the detection probability in the y-axis versus the cumulative distribution function of the false-alarm probability on the x-axis.

ROC analysis provides tools to select possibly optimal models and to discard suboptimal ones independently from (and prior to specifying) the cost context or the class distribution. ROC analysis is related in a direct and natural way to cost/benefit analysis of diagnostic [[decision making]].

The ROC curve was first developed by electrical engineers and radar engineers during World War II for detecting enemy objects in battlefields and was soon introduced to [[psychology]] to account for perceptual detection of stimuli. ROC analysis since then has been used in [[medicine]], [[radiology]], [[biometrics]], [[forecasting]] of [[natural hazard]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peres|first=D.

The ROC is also known as a relative operating characteristic curve, because it is a comparison of two operating characteristics (TPR and FPR) as the criterion changes.&lt;ref name="Swets1996"&gt;Swets, John A.; [https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=91082370 ''Signal detection theory and ROC analysis in psychology and diagnostics : collected papers''], Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Mahwah, NJ, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic concept==

{{See also|Type I and type II errors|Sensitivity and specificity}}
A classification model ([[Classifier (mathematics)|classifier]] or [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]]) is a [[Mapping (mathematics)|mapping]] of instances between certain classes/groups. The classifier or diagnosis result can be a [[Real number|real value]] (continuous output), in which case the classifier boundary between classes must be determined by a threshold value (for instance, to determine whether a person has [[hypertension]] based on a [[blood pressure]] measure). Or it can be a [[Countable set|discrete]] class label, indicating one of the classes.

Let us consider a two-class prediction problem ([[binary classification]]), in which the outcomes are labeled either as positive (''p'') or negative (''n''). There are four possible outcomes from a binary classifier. If the outcome from a prediction is ''p'' and the actual value is also ''p'', then it is called a ''true positive'' (TP); however if the actual value is ''n'' then it is said to be a ''false positive'' (FP). Conversely, a ''true negative'' (TN) has occurred when both the prediction outcome and the actual value are ''n'', and ''false negative'' (FN) is when the prediction outcome is ''n'' while the actual value is ''p''.

To get an appropriate example in a real-world problem, consider a diagnostic test that seeks to determine whether a person has a certain disease. A false positive in this case occurs when the person tests positive, but does not actually have the disease. A false negative, on the other hand, occurs when the person tests negative, suggesting they are healthy, when they actually do have the disease.

Let us define an experiment from '''P''' positive instances and '''N''' negative instances for some condition. The four outcomes can be formulated in a 2×2 ''[[contingency table]]'' or ''[[confusion matrix]]'', as follows:

{{DiagnosticTesting_Diagram}}

--&gt;
==ROC space==
[[Image:ROC space-2.png|thumb|right|250px|The ROC space and plots of the four prediction examples.]]
The contingency table can derive several evaluation "metrics" (see infobox). To draw an ROC curve, only the true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR) are needed (as functions of some classifier parameter). The TPR defines how many correct positive results occur among all positive samples available during the test. FPR, on the other hand, defines how many incorrect positive results occur among all negative samples available during the test.

An ROC space is defined by FPR and TPR as ''x'' and ''y'' axes, respectively, which depicts relative trade-offs between true positive (benefits) and false positive (costs). Since TPR is equivalent to sensitivity and FPR is equal to 1 − specificity, the ROC graph is sometimes called the sensitivity vs (1 − specificity) plot. Each prediction result or instance of a [[confusion matrix]] represents one point in the ROC space.

The best possible prediction method would yield a point in the upper left corner or coordinate (0,1) of the ROC space, representing 100% sensitivity (no false negatives) and 100% specificity (no false positives). The (0,1) point is also called a ''perfect classification''. A random guess would give a point along a diagonal line (the so-called ''line of no-discrimination'') from the left bottom to the top right corners (regardless of the positive and negative [[base rate]]s). An intuitive example of random guessing is a decision by flipping coins. As the size of the sample increases, a random classifier's ROC point tends towards the diagonal line. In the case of a balanced coin, it will tend to the point (0.5, 0.5).

The diagonal divides the ROC space. Points above the diagonal represent good classification results (better than random); points below the line represent bad results (worse than random). Note that the output of a consistently bad predictor could simply be inverted to obtain a good predictor.

Let us look into four prediction results from 100 positive and 100 negative instances:

|}

Plots of the four results above in the ROC space are given in the figure. The result of method '''A''' clearly shows the best predictive power among '''A''', '''B''', and '''C'''. The result of '''B''' lies on the random guess line (the diagonal line), and it can be seen in the table that the accuracy of '''B''' is 50%. However, when '''C''' is mirrored across the center point (0.5,0.5), the resulting method '''C′''' is even better than '''A'''. This mirrored method simply reverses the predictions of whatever method or test produced the '''C''' contingency table. Although the original '''C''' method has negative predictive power, simply reversing its decisions leads to a new predictive method '''C′''' which has positive predictive power. When the '''C''' method predicts '''p''' or '''n''', the '''C′''' method would predict '''n''' or '''p''', respectively. In this manner, the '''C′''' test would perform the best. The closer a result from a contingency table is to the upper left corner, the better it predicts, but the distance from the random guess line in either direction is the best indicator of how much predictive power a method has. If the result is below the line (i.e. the method is worse than a random guess), all of the method's predictions must be reversed in order to utilize its power, thereby moving the result above the random guess line.

==Curves in ROC space==
[[File:ROC curves.svg|thumb|right|300px]]
In binary classification, the class prediction for each instance is often made based on a [[Continuous probability distribution|continuous random variable]] &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt;, which is a "score" computed for the instance (e.g. the estimated probability in logistic regression). Given a threshold parameter &lt;math&gt; T &lt;/math&gt;, the instance is classified as "positive" if &lt;math&gt; X&gt;T &lt;/math&gt;, and "negative" otherwise. &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; follows a probability density &lt;math&gt; f_1 (x) &lt;/math&gt; if the instance actually belongs to class "positive", and &lt;math&gt; f_0 (x) &lt;/math&gt; if otherwise. Therefore, the true positive rate is given by &lt;math&gt; \mbox{TPR}(T)= \int_{T}^\infty f_1(x) \, dx &lt;/math&gt; and the false positive rate is given by &lt;math&gt; \mbox{FPR}(T)= \int_{T}^\infty f_0(x) \, dx &lt;/math&gt;. 
The ROC curve plots parametrically TPR(T) versus FPR(T) with T as the varying parameter.

For example, imagine that the blood protein levels in diseased people and healthy people are [[normal distribution|normally distributed]] with means of 2 [[gram|g]]/[[decilitre|dL]] and 1 g/dL respectively. A medical test might measure the level of a certain protein in a blood sample and classify any number above a certain threshold as indicating disease. The experimenter can adjust the threshold (black vertical line in the figure), which will in turn change the false positive rate. Increasing the threshold would result in fewer false positives (and more false negatives), corresponding to a leftward movement on the curve. The actual shape of the curve is determined by how much overlap the two distributions have.  These concepts are demonstrated in the [https://kennis-research.shinyapps.io/ROC-Curves/ Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curves Applet.]

==Further interpretations==

Sometimes, the ROC is used to generate a summary statistic. Common versions are:
* the intercept of the ROC curve with the line at 45 degrees orthogonal to the no-discrimination line - the balance point where [[Sensitivity and specificity|Sensitivity]] = 1 - [[Specificity (statistics)|Specificity]] 
* the intercept of the ROC curve with the tangent at 45 degrees parallel to the no-discrimination line that is closest to the error-free point (0,1) - also called [[Youden's J statistic]] and generalized as Informedness&lt;ref name="Powers2007"/&gt;
* the area between the ROC curve and the no-discrimination line multiplied by two - [[Gini Coefficient]]
* the area between the full ROC curve and the triangular ROC curve including only (0,0), (1,1) and one selected operating point (tpr,fpr) - Consistency&lt;ref name="Powers2012a"&gt;{{cite conference |title=ROC-ConCert: ROC-Based Measurement of Consistency and Certainty|first=David MW |last=Powers|year=2012|booktitle=Spring Congress on Engineering and Technology (SCET)|volume=2|pages=238–241|publisher=IEEE}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the area under the ROC curve, or "AUC" ("Area Under Curve"), or A' (pronounced "a-prime"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first1=James |last1=Fogarty |first2=Ryan S. |last2=Baker |first3=Scott E. |last3=Hudson |year=2005 |title=Case studies in the use of ROC curve analysis for sensor-based estimates in human computer interaction |booktitle=ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, Proceedings of Graphics Interface 2005 |publisher=Canadian Human-Computer Communications Society |location=Waterloo, ON |url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1089530 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or "c-statistic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Trevor |last1=Hastie|authorlink1=Trevor Hastie|first2=Robert |last2=Tibshirani |authorlink2=Robert Tibshirani|first3=Jerome H. |last3=Friedman |year=2009 |title=The elements of statistical learning: data mining, inference, and prediction |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the [[sensitivity index|sensitivity index ''d''']] (pronounced "d-prime"), the distance between the mean of the distribution of activity in the system under noise-alone conditions and its distribution under signal-alone conditions, divided by their [[standard deviation]], under the assumption that both these distributions are [[normal distribution|normal]] with the same standard deviation. Under these assumptions, the shape of the ROC is entirely determined by ''d'''.

However, any attempt to summarize the ROC curve into a single number loses information about the pattern of tradeoffs of the particular discriminator algorithm.

===Area under the curve===
When using normalized units, the area under the curve (often referred to as simply the AUC) is equal to the probability that a classifier will rank a randomly chosen positive instance higher than a randomly chosen negative one (assuming 'positive' ranks higher than 'negative').&lt;ref&gt;Fawcett, Tom (2006); ''An introduction to ROC analysis'', Pattern Recognition Letters, 27, 861–874.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen as follows: the area under the curve is given by (the integral boundaries are reversed as large T has
a lower value on the x-axis)
:&lt;math&gt; A = \int_{\infty}^{-\infty} \mbox{TPR}(T) \mbox{FPR}'(T) \, dT = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} I(T'&gt;T)f_1(T') f_0(T) \, dT' \, dT = P(X_1 &gt; X_0) &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; X_1 &lt;/math&gt; is the score for a positive instance and &lt;math&gt; X_0 &lt;/math&gt; is the score for a negative instance, and &lt;math&gt;f_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f_1&lt;/math&gt; are probability densities as defined in previous section.

It can further be shown that the AUC is closely related to the [[Mann–Whitney U]],&lt;ref name="Hanley"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hanley |first1=James A. |last2=McNeil |first2=Barbara J. |journal=Radiology |number=1 |pages=29–36 |title=The Meaning and Use of the Area under a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve |volume=143 |year=1982 |pmid=7063747 |doi=10.1148/radiology.143.1.7063747}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mason"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mason |first1=Simon J. |last2=Graham |first2=Nicholas E. |year=2002 |title=Areas beneath the relative operating characteristics (ROC) and relative operating levels (ROL) curves: Statistical significance and interpretation |journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society |volume=128 |pages=2145–2166 |url=http://www.inmet.gov.br/documentos/cursoI_INMET_IRI/Climate_Information_Course/References/Mason+Graham_2002.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120134338/http://www.inmet.gov.br/documentos/cursoI_INMET_IRI/Climate_Information_Course/References/Mason%2BGraham_2002.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-11-20 |doi=10.1256/003590002320603584 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which tests whether positives are ranked higher than negatives. It is also equivalent to the [[Wilcoxon signed-rank test|Wilcoxon test of ranks]].&lt;ref name="Mason" /&gt; The AUC is related to the [[Gini coefficient]] (&lt;math&gt;G_1&lt;/math&gt;) by the formula &lt;math&gt;G_1 = 2 \mbox{AUC} - 1&lt;/math&gt;, where:

:&lt;math&gt;G_1 = 1 - \sum_{k=1}^n (X_{k} - X_{k-1}) (Y_k + Y_{k-1})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hand, David J.; and Till, Robert J. (2001); ''A simple generalization of the area under the ROC curve for multiple class classification problems'', Machine Learning, 45, 171–186.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this way, it is possible to calculate the AUC by using an average of a number of trapezoidal approximations.

It is also common to calculate the Area Under the ROC Convex Hull (ROC AUCH = ROCH AUC) as any point on the line segment between two prediction results can be achieved by randomly using one or other system with probabilities proportional to the relative length of the opposite component of the segment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=F. |last1=Provost |first2=T. |last2=Fawcett |title=Robust classification for imprecise environments. |journal=Machine Learning |volume=42 |pages=203–231 |year=2001 |doi=10.1023/a:1007601015854 |arxiv=cs/0009007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible to invert concavities – just as in the figure the worse solution can be reflected to become a better solution; concavities can be reflected in any line segment, but this more extreme form of fusion is much more likely to overfit the data.&lt;ref name="FlachWu2005"&gt;{{cite conference |first1=P.A. |last1=Flach |first2=S. |last2=Wu |year=2005 |title= Repairing concavities in ROC curves. |booktitle= 19th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI'05) |pages= 702–707 |url=http://www.icml-2011.org/papers/385_icmlpaper.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[machine learning]] community most often uses the ROC AUC statistic for model comparison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |issue=3 |pages=839–843 |last1=Hanley |first1=James A.| last2=McNeil |first2=Barbara J. |title=A method of comparing the areas under receiver operating characteristic curves derived from the same cases |journal=Radiology |accessdate=2008-12-03 |date=1983-09-01 |volume=148 |url=http://radiology.rsnajnls.org/cgi/content/abstract/148/3/839 |pmid=6878708 |doi=10.1148/radiology.148.3.6878708}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice has recently been questioned because AUC estimates are quite noisy and suffers from other problemns.&lt;ref name="Hanczar2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hanczar | first1 = Blaise | last2 = Hua | first2 = Jianping | last3 = Sima | first3 = Chao | last4 = Weinstein | first4 = John | last5 = Bittner | first5 = Michael | last6 = Dougherty | first6 = Edward R | year = 2010 | title = Small-sample precision of ROC-related estimates | url = | journal = Bioinformatics | volume = 26 | issue = 6| pages = 822–830 | doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btq037}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="Lobo2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lobo | first1 = Jorge M. | last2 = Jiménez-Valverde | first2 = Alberto | last3 = Real | first3 = Raimundo | year = 2008 | title = AUC: a misleading measure of the performance of predictive distribution models | url = | journal = Global Ecology and Biogeography | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 145–151 | doi=10.1111/j.1466-8238.2007.00358.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hand2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hand | first1 = David J | year = 2009 | title = Measuring classifier performance: A coherent alternative to the area under the ROC curve | url = | journal = Machine Learning | volume = 77 | issue = | pages = 103–123 | doi=10.1007/s10994-009-5119-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Nonetheless, the coherence of AUC as a measure of aggregated classification performance has been vindicated, in terms of a uniform rate distribution,&lt;ref name="Flachetal2011"&gt;{{cite conference |first1=P.A. |last1=Flach |first2=J. |last2=Hernandez-Orallo | first3=C. | last3=Ferri |year=2011 |title=A coherent interpretation of AUC as a measure of aggregated classification performance. |booktitle=Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML-11) |pages=657–664|url=http://www.icml-2011.org/papers/385_icmlpaper.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and AUC has been linked to a number of other performance metrics such as the [[Brier score]].&lt;ref name="hernandez2012unified "&gt;{{cite journal |first1=J. |last1= Hernandez-Orallo| first2=P.A.| last2=Flach | first3=C. | last3=Ferri |year=2012 |title=A unified view of performance metrics: translating threshold choice into expected classification loss|journal=Journal of Machine Learning Research|volume=13 |pages=2813–2869 |url=http://jmlr.org/papers/volume13/hernandez-orallo12a/hernandez-orallo12a.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another problem with ROC AUC is that reducing the ROC Curve to a single number ignores the fact that it is about the tradeoffs between the different systems or performance points plotted and not the performance of an individual system, as well as ignoring the possibility of concavity repair, so that related alternative measures such as Informedness&lt;ref name="Powers2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Powers|first=David M W|year=2011|origyear=2007|title=Evaluation: From Precision, Recall and F-Measure  to ROC, Informedness, Markedness &amp; Correlation|url=http://www.bioinfopublication.org/files/articles/2_1_1_JMLT.pdf|journal=Journal of Machine Learning Technologies|volume=2|issue=1|pages=37–63}} [http://dl.dropbox.com/u/27743223/201101-Evaluation_JMLT_Postprint-Colour.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; or DeltaP are recommended.&lt;ref name="Powers2012a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Powers2012b"&gt;{{cite conference |first=David M.W. |last=Powers |title=The Problem of Area Under the Curve |booktitle=International Conference on Information Science and Technology |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These measures are essentially equivalent to the Gini for a single prediction point with DeltaP' = Informedness = 2AUC-1, whilst DeltaP = Markedness represents the dual (viz. predicting the prediction from the real class) and their geometric mean is the [[Matthews correlation coefficient]].&lt;ref name="Powers2007"/&gt;

Whereas ROC AUC varies between 0 and 1 — with an uninformative classifier yielding 0.5 — the alternative measures known as [[Informedness]]&lt;ref name="Powers2007"/&gt;, Certainty &lt;ref name="Powers2012a"/&gt; and [[Gini Coefficient]] (in the single parameterization or single system case)&lt;ref name="Powers2007"/&gt; all have the advantage that 0 represents chance performance whilst 1 represents perfect performance, and −1 represents the "perverse" case of full informedness always giving the wrong response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|first=David M. W. |last=Powers |year=2003 |title= Recall and Precision versus the Bookmaker |booktitle=Proceedings of the International Conference on Cognitive Science (ICSC-2003), Sydney Australia, 2003, pp.&amp;nbsp;529–534. | url=http://dl.dropbox.com/u/27743223/200302-ICCS-Bookmaker.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bringing chance performance to 0 allows these alternative scales to be interpreted as Kappa statistics. Informedness has been shown to have desirable characteristics for Machine Learning versus other common definitions of Kappa such as [[Cohen's kappa|Cohen Kappa]] and [[Fleiss' kappa|Fleiss Kappa]].&lt;ref name="Powers2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first=David M.

Sometimes it can be more useful to look at a specific region of the ROC Curve rather than at the whole curve. It is possible to compute partial AUC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0272989X8900900307 |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=190–195 |last=McClish |first=Donna Katzman |title=Analyzing a Portion of the ROC Curve |journal=Medical Decision Making |accessdate=2008-09-29 |date=1989-08-01 |url=http://mdm.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/9/3/190 |pmid=2668680 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one could focus on the region of the curve with low false positive rate, which is often of prime interest for population screening tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/1541-0420.00071 |volume=59 |issue=3 |pages=614–623 |last1=Dodd |first1=Lori E. | first2=Margaret S. |last2=Pepe |title=Partial AUC Estimation and Regression |journal=Biometrics |accessdate=2007-12-18 |year=2003 |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1541-0420.00071 |pmid=14601762 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another common approach for classification problems in which P ≪ N (common in bioinformatics applications) is to use a logarithmic scale for the x-axis.&lt;ref&gt;Karplus, Kevin (2011); [http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/~karplus/papers/better-than-chance-sep-07.pdf ''Better than Chance: the importance of null models''], University of California, Santa Cruz, in Proceedings of the First International Workshop on Pattern Recognition in Proteomics, Structural Biology and Bioinformatics (PR PS BB 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other measures===
The [[Total Operating Characteristic]] (TOC) also characterizes diagnostic ability while revealing more information than the ROC. For each threshold, ROC reveals two ratios, TP/(TP + FN) and FP/(FP + TN). In other words, ROC reveals hits/(hits + misses)and false alarms/(false alarms + correct rejections). On the other hand, TOC shows the total information in the contingency table for each threshold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pontius|first1=Robert Gilmore|last2=Parmentier|first2=Benoit|title=Recommendations for using the Relative Operating Characteristic (ROC)|journal=Landscape Ecology|date=2014|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TOC method reveals all of the information that the ROC method provides, plus additional important information that ROC does not reveal, i.e. the size of every entry in the contingency table for each threshold. TOC also provides the popular AUC of the ROC. 
[[File:TOC.png|thumb|left|TOC Curve]]
[[File:ROC.png|thumb|left|ROC Curve]]
These figures are the TOC and ROC curves using the same data and thresholds.
Consider the point that corresponds to a threshold of 74. The TOC curve shows the number of hits, which is 3, and hence the number of misses, which is 7. Additionally, the TOC curve shows that the number of false alarms is 4 and the number of correct rejections is 16. At any given point in the ROC curve, it is possible to glean values for the ratios of false alarms/(false alarms + correct rejections) and hits/(hits + misses). For example, at threshold 74, it is evident that the x coordinate is 0.3 and the y coordinate is 0.2. However, these two values are insufficient to construct all entries of the underlying two-by-two contingency table.

==Detection error tradeoff graph==
[[File:Example of DET curves.png|thumb|Example DET graph]]
An alternative to the ROC curve is the [[detection error tradeoff]] (DET) graph, which plots the false negative rate (missed detections) vs. the false positive rate (false alarms) on non-linearly transformed x- and y-axes. The transformation function is the quantile function of the normal distribution, i.e., the inverse of the cumulative normal distribution. It is, in fact, the same transformation as zROC, below, except that the complement of the hit rate, the miss rate or false negative rate, is used. This alternative spends more graph area on the region of interest. Most of the ROC area is of little interest; one primarily cares about the region tight against the y-axis and the top left corner – which, because of using miss rate instead of its complement, the hit rate, is the lower left corner in a DET plot. Furthermore, DET graphs have the useful property of linearity and a linear threshold behavior for normal distributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Navractil|first=J.|last2=Klusacek|first2=D.|date=2007-04-01|title=On Linear DETs|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4218079/|journal=2007 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing - ICASSP '07|volume=4|pages=IV–229-IV-232|doi=10.1109/ICASSP.2007.367205}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DET plot is used extensively in the automatic speaker recognition community, where the name DET was first used. The analysis of the ROC performance in graphs with this warping of the axes was used by psychologists in perception studies halfway through the 20th century, where this was dubbed "double probability paper".{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Z-score==

If a [[standard score]] is applied to the ROC curve, the curve will be transformed into a straight line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Neil A. |last1=MacMillan |first2=C. Douglas |last2=Creelman |edition=2nd |year=2005 |title=Detection Theory: A User's Guide |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |location=Mahwah, NJ | isbn=1-4106-1114-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This z-score is based on a normal distribution with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. In memory [[strength theory]], one must assume that the zROC is not only linear, but has a slope of 1.0. The normal distributions of targets (studied objects that the subjects need to recall) and lures (non studied objects that the subjects attempt to recall) is the factor causing the zROC to be linear.

The linearity of the zROC curve depends on the standard deviations of the target and lure strength distributions. If the standard deviations are equal, the slope will be 1.0. If the standard deviation of the target strength distribution is larger than the standard deviation of the lure strength distribution, then the slope will be smaller than 1.0. In most studies, it has been found that the zROC curve slopes constantly fall below 1, usually between 0.5 and 0.9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Glanzer |first=Murray |first2=Kim |last2=Kisok |last3=Hilford |first3=Andy |last4=Adams |first4=John K. |title=Slope of the receiver-operating characteristic in recognition memory |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition |year=1999 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=500–513 |doi=10.1037/0278-7393.25.2.500}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many experiments yielded a zROC slope of 0.8. A slope of 0.8 implies that the variability of the target strength distribution is 25% larger than the variability of the lure strength distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ratcliff |first1=Roger |last2=McCoon |first2=Gail |last3=Tindall |first3=Michael |title=Empirical generality of data from recognition memory ROC functions and implications for GMMs |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition |year=1994 |volume=20 |pages=763–785 |doi=10.1037/0278-7393.20.4.763}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another variable used is&amp;nbsp;[[D prime|''d&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' (d prime)]] (discussed above in "Other measures"), which can easily be expressed in terms of z-values. Although ''d''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a commonly used parameter, it must be recognized that it is only relevant when strictly adhering to the very strong assumptions of strength theory made above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zhang |first=Jun |last2=Mueller |first2=Shane T. |title=A note on ROC analysis and non-parametric estimate of sensitivity |journal=Psychometrika |year=2005 |volume=70 |issue=|doi=10.1007/s11336-003-1119-8 |pages=203–212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The z-score of an ROC curve is always linear, as assumed, except in special situations. The Yonelinas familiarity-recollection model is a two-dimensional account of recognition memory. Instead of the subject simply answering yes or no to a specific input, the subject gives the input a feeling of familiarity, which operates like the original ROC curve. What changes, though, is a parameter for Recollection (R). Recollection is assumed to be all-or-none, and it trumps familiarity. If there were no recollection component, zROC would have a predicted slope of 1. However, when adding the recollection component, the zROC curve will be concave up, with a decreased slope. This difference in shape and slope result from an added element of variability due to some items being recollected. Patients with anterograde amnesia are unable to recollect, so their Yonelinas zROC curve would have a slope close to 1.0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yonelinas |first1=Andrew P. |last2=Kroll |first2=Neal E.

==History==
The ROC curve was first used during [[World War II]] for the analysis of [[radar|radar signals]] before it was employed in [[signal detection theory]].&lt;ref name="green66"&gt;{{cite book |first1=David M. |last1=Green |first2=John A. |last2=Swets |title=Signal detection theory and psychophysics |publisher=John Wiley and Sons Inc. |year=1966 |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-471-32420-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] in 1941, the United States army began new research to increase the prediction of correctly detected Japanese aircraft from their radar signals. For these purposes they measured the ability of a radar receiver operator to make these important distinctions, which was called the Receiver Operating Characteristic.&lt;ref name="roc etymology"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.math.utah.edu/~gamez/files/ROC-Curves.pdf |title=Using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve to analyze a classification model: A final note of historical interest |last= |first= |publisher=Department of Mathematics, University of Utah |date= |website=Department of Mathematics, University of Utah |access-date=May 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, ROC curves were employed in [[psychophysics]] to assess human (and occasionally non-human animal) detection of weak signals.&lt;ref name="green66" /&gt; In [[medicine]], ROC analysis has been extensively used in the evaluation of [[diagnostic test]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Mark H. |last1=Zweig |first2=Gregory |last2=Campbell |journal=Clinical Chemistry |pmid=8472349 |title=Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) plots: a fundamental evaluation tool in clinical medicine |volume=39 |issue=8 |year=1993 |pages=561–577 |url=http://www.clinchem.org/content/39/4/561.full.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Margaret S. |last=Pepe |title=The statistical evaluation of medical tests for classification and prediction |location=New York, NY |publisher=Oxford |year=2003 |isbn=0-19-856582-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ROC curves are also used extensively in [[epidemiology]] and [[medical research]] and are frequently mentioned in conjunction with [[evidence-based medicine]]. In [[radiology]], ROC analysis is a common technique to evaluate new radiology techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Nancy A. |last=Obuchowski |title=Receiver operating characteristic curves and their use in radiology |pmid=14519861 |journal=Radiology |volume=229 |issue=1 |year=2003 |pages=3–8 |doi=10.1148/radiol.2291010898 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the social sciences, ROC analysis is often called the ROC Accuracy Ratio, a common technique for judging the accuracy of default probability models.
ROC curves are widely used in laboratory medicine to assess the diagnostic accuracy of a test, to choose the optimal cut-off of a test and to compare diagnostic accuracy of several tests.

ROC curves also proved useful for the evaluation of [[machine learning]] techniques. The first application of ROC in machine learning was by Spackman who demonstrated the value of ROC curves in comparing and evaluating different classification [[algorithm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Spackman |first=Kent A. |year=1989 |title=Signal detection theory: Valuable tools for evaluating inductive learning |booktitle=Proceedings of the Sixth International Workshop on Machine Learning |location=San Mateo, CA |pages=160–163 |publisher=[[Morgan Kaufmann]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ROC curves are also used in verification of forecasts in meteorology.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |first=Viatcheslav |last=Kharin| title=On the ROC score of probability forecasts| journal=Journal of Climate| volume=16|number=24|  pages=4145-4150|year=2003|doi=10.1175/1520-0442(2003)016&lt;4145:OTRSOP&gt;2.0.CO;2

The extension of ROC curves for classification problems with more than two classes has always been cumbersome, as the degrees of freedom increase quadratically with the number of classes, and the ROC space has &lt;math&gt;c(c-1)&lt;/math&gt; dimensions, where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the number of classes.&lt;ref name="Srinivasan99"&gt;{{cite conference |first=A.|last=Srinivasan|year=1999 |title=Note on the Location of Optimal Classifiers in N-dimensional ROC Space|booktitle=Technical Report PRG-TR-2-99, Oxford University Computing Laboratory, Wolfson Building, Parks Road, Oxford.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some approaches have been made for the particular case with three classes (three-way ROC).&lt;ref name="Mossman99"&gt;{{cite journal |first=D.| last= Mossman |year=1999 |title=Three-way ROCs |journal=Medical Decision Making |volume=19 |pages=78–89 |doi=10.1177/0272989x9901900110}}&lt;/ref&gt; The calculation of the volume under the ROC surface (VUS) has been analyzed and studied as a performance metric for multi-class problems.&lt;ref name="Ferri03"&gt;{{cite conference |first1=C. | last1=Ferri |first2=J.|last2=Hernandez-Orallo | first3=M.A.| last3=Salido |year=2003 |title=Volume under the ROC Surface for Multi-class Problems|booktitle=Machine Learning: ECML 2003|pages=108–120.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because of the complexity of approximating the true VUS, some other approaches &lt;ref name="HandTill01"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=D.J.| last1= Till| first2=R.J.| last2=Hand |year=2001 |title=A Simple Generalisation of the Area Under the ROC Curve for Multiple Class Classification Problems|journal=Machine Learning|volume=45|pages=171–186 | doi=10.1023/A:1010920819831}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on an extension of AUC are more popular as an evaluation metric.

Given the success of ROC curves for the assessment of classification models, the extension of ROC curves for other supervised tasks has also been investigated. Notable proposals for regression problems are the so-called regression error characteristic (REC) Curves &lt;ref name="bij2003regression"&gt;{{cite conference |first1=J.|last1=Bi | first2=K.P.| last2=Bennett |year=2003 |title=Regression error characteristic curves |booktitle=Twentieth International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML-2003). Washington, DC.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Regression ROC (RROC) curves.&lt;ref name="hernandez2013rroc "&gt;{{cite journal |first=J.| last= Hernandez-Orallo |year=2013 |title=ROC curves for regression|journal=Pattern Recognition|volume=46 |issue=12|pages=3395–3411 . |doi=10.1016/j.patcog.2013.06.014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter, RROC curves become extremely similar to ROC curves for classification, with the notions of asymmetry, dominance and convex hull. Also, the area under RROC curves is proportional to the error variance of the regression model.

When creating [[computer-generated imagery]], final scenes appearing in movies and television productions are usually produced by [[rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]] more than one "layer" or "pass," which are multiple images designed to be put together through digital [[compositing]] to form a completed frame.

Rendering in passes is based on a traditions in [[motion control photography]] which predate CGI. As an example, for a visual effects shot, a camera could be programmed to move past a physical model of a spaceship in one pass to film the fully lit beauty pass of the ship, and then to repeat exactly the same camera move passing the ship again to photograph additional elements such as the illuminated windows in the ship or its thrusters. Once all of the passes were filmed, they could then be optically printed together to form a completed shot.

The terms ''render layers'' and ''render passes'' are sometimes used interchangeably. However, rendering in layers refers specifically to separating different ''objects'' into separate images, such as a layer each for foreground characters, sets, distant landscape, and sky. On the other hand, rendering in passes  refers to separating out different ''aspects'' of the scene, such as shadows, highlights, or reflections, into separate images.

==Climate change==
The program was to be subsidized by the Dutch Ministry of Environment during 2007-2009 "for the specific purpose of organizing a process of knowledge exchange, which is dedicated to the determination of the 50 most pressing policy-relevant research questions related to environmental and climate change issues in the coming years."&lt;ref name=accreditapp/&gt;{{rp|12}}

The program's large number of Ph.D. students was used in an unusual way in 2013.  They were called upon for use in rapid vetting of a draft climatic change report in a crowd-sourcing mode.  The process initially sought participation students pursuing Ph.Ds in the Netherlands, and ended up obtaining 40 of them plus 50 Ph.D. students from elsewhere.  The students were distributed across 30 teams including at least one Dutch student per team, and the Dutch students earned educational credits plus "blooper bonus" pay and other incentives.&lt;ref name=vetting/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4810">The '''Rossiter–McLaughlin effect''' is a [[astronomical spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] phenomenon observed when either an [[eclipsing binary|eclipsing binary's]] secondary star or an [[extrasolar planet]] is seen to [[astronomical transit|transit]] across the face of the primary or parent star. As the main star rotates on its axis, one quadrant of its [[photosphere]] will be seen to be coming towards the viewer, and the other visible quadrant to be moving away. These motions produce [[blueshift]]s and [[redshift]]s, respectively, in the star's [[stellar spectrum|spectrum]], usually observed as a broadening of the [[spectral line]]s. When the secondary star or planet transits the primary, it blocks part of the latter's disc, preventing some of the shifted light from reaching the observer. This causes the observed mean redshift of the primary star as a whole to vary from its normal value. As the transiting object moves across to the other side of the star's disc, the redshift anomaly will switch from being negative to being positive, or vice versa.  This effect has been used to show that as many as 25% of [[hot jupiter|hot Jupiters]] are orbiting in a retrograde direction with respect to their parent stars,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Triaud |first=A. H. M. J. |display-authors=etal |year=2010 |title=Spin-orbit angle measurements for six southern transiting planets: New insights into the dynamical origins of hot Jupiters |journal=Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics |volume=524 |issue= |pages=A25 |doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201014525 |arxiv=1008.2353 |bibcode = 2010A&amp;A...524A..25T }}&lt;/ref&gt; strongly suggesting that dynamical interactions rather than [[planetary migration]] produce these objects.

[[Image:Rossiter-McLaughlin effect.svg|frame|center|Illustration showing the effect. The viewer is situated at the bottom. Light from the anticlockwise-rotating star is blue-shifted on the approaching side, and red-shifted on the receding side. As the planet passes in front of the star it sequentially blocks blue- and red-shifted light, causing the star's apparent radial velocity to change when it in fact does not.]]

== History ==
J. R. Holt in 1893 proposed a method to measure the [[stellar rotation]] of stars using [[radial velocity]] measurements, he predicted that when one star of an eclipsing binary eclipsed the other it would first cover the advancing blueshifted half and then the receding redshifted half. This motion would create a [[redshift]] of the eclipsed star’s spectrum followed by a [[blueshift]], thus appearing as a change in the radial velocity in addition to that caused by the orbital motion of the eclipsed star.&lt;ref name="Triaud2013"/&gt;

The effect is named after [[Richard Alfred Rossiter]] and [[Dean Benjamin McLaughlin]].

SMBH, Inc. has worked with architectural firms such as [[Graham Gund]]'s Gund Partnership, [[Mack Scogin Merrill Elam]] Architects, [[Peter Eisenman]], and [[Robert A.M. Stern]].

== History ==
SMBH, Inc. located in Columbus, Ohio, was founded in 1972 as a structural engineering firm for the architectural industry. Founded as Lantz and Jones, the firm changed its name to Lantz Jones and Nebraska, Inc. in 1975 to reflect a change in ownership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dev.smbhinc.com.php54-1.ord1-1.websitetestlink.com/about/history.html] SMBH, Inc., July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Lantz Jones and Nebraska had offices in [[Charleston, West Virginia]] and [[Stuart, Florida]]. SMBH, Inc. still performs work in these areas, but now operates out of the Columbus, Ohio office. During the past two decades, the ownership has transitioned from Bill Lantz, Tom Jones and Jim Nebraska to Stephen J. Metz, Bob Baumann, and Jon Beier. The ownership transition prompted the name change to Shelley Metz Baumann Hawk, Inc. in 2005 and in 2013, the company name was shortened to SMBH, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tilt-up.org/tilt-uptoday/2013/05/16/shelley-metz-baumann-hawk-changes-name-to-smbh-inc/] Tilt-Up Concrete Association, 16 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
{{expand section|date= April 2017}}
Atran was born in [[New York City]] in 1952.

While a student, he became assistant to anthropologist [[Margaret Mead]] at the [[American Museum of Natural History]]. He received his BA from [[Columbia College, Columbia University|Columbia College]], MA from [[Johns Hopkins University]], and PhD in [[anthropology]] from [[Columbia University]].

==Career==
Atran has taught at Cambridge University, [[Hebrew University]] in [[Jerusalem]], the [[École des Hautes Études]] and [[École Polytechnique]] in Paris, and [[John Jay College of Criminal Justice]] in New York City. He is a research director in anthropology at the [[French National Centre for Scientific Research]] and member of the [[Jean Nicod Institute]] at the [[École Normale Supérieure]]. He is also research professor of [[public policy]] and [[psychology]] at the [[University of Michigan]], founding fellow of the Centre for the Resolution of Intractable Conflict at [[Oxford University]], and cofounder of ARTIS International.

===Early years===
In 1974 he originated a debate at the Abbaye de Royaumont in France on the nature of universals in human thought and society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| editor-first= Lawrence |editor-last= Kritzman| title= The Columbia History of Twentieth-Century French Thought| place= New York| publisher= Columbia University Press| year= 2006| pages= 179–180| isbn= 978-0-231-10791-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other participants included linguist [[Noam Chomsky]], psychologist [[Jean Piaget]], anthropologists [[Gregory Bateson]] and [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last= Kwong |first= Emily |url=  http://spectatorarchive.library.columbia.edu/cgi-bin/columbia?a=d&amp;d=cs20091117-01.2.6 |title=Columbia antro dept. remembers Claude Lévi-Strauss |publisher=Columbia Spectator |date=November 17, 2009 |accessdate=July 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and biologists [[François Jacob]] and [[Jacques Monod]], which Harvard's [[Howard Gardner]] and others consider a milestone in the development of cognitive science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first= Harold| last= Gardner| chapter= Encounter at Royaumont| title=Art, Mind, and Brain: A Cognitive Approach to Creativity| place= New York| publisher= Basic Books| year= 1982| pages= 16–26| isbn= 978-0-465-00444-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atran has also been a staunch opponent of political attempts to eliminate government funding for social science, arguing that it is critical to the national interest, including innovation and security in business, technology, medicine and defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/03/15/social_warfare_budget_republicans |title=Social Warfare |work=Foreign Policy |date=March 15, 2013 |accessdate=March 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has collaborated on research on how political negotiations could be made more likely to produce agreement. Atran and the psychologists [[Jeremy Ginges]] and [[Douglas Medin]] and political scientist [[Khalil Shikaki]] conducted an experiment that surveyed "600 Jewish settlers in the West Bank, more than 500 Palestinian refugees, and more than 700 Palestinian students, half of whom identified with Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad."&lt;ref name="sacred bounds"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Jeremy |last1=Ginges |first2=Scott |last2=Atran |first3=Douglas |last3=Medin |first4=Khalil |last4= Shikaki |title=Sacred bounds on rational resolution of violent political conflict |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]] |year=2007 |volume=104 |issue=18 |pages=7357–60 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0701768104 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pinker Angels"&gt;{{cite book| first= Steven| last= Pinker| title= The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined| publisher= Viking Press| year= 2011| isbn= 978-0-670-02295-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|638}} The researchers divided the subjects into three groups, each of which was presented with a different "hypothetical peace deal." In the basic situation, those surveyed were presented with "a two-state solution in which the Israelis would withdraw from 99 percent of the West Bank and Gaza but would not have to absorb Palestinian refugees"; the proposal "did not go over well."&lt;ref name="Pinker Angels" /&gt;{{rp|638}} For the second group, the hypothetical deal "was sweetened with cash compensation from the United States and the European Union, such as a billion dollars a year for a hundred years, or a guarantee that the people would live in peace and prosperity. With these sweeteners on the table, the nonabsolutists, as expected, softened their opposition a bit. But the absolutists, forced to contemplate a taboo tradeoff, were even more disgusted, angry, and prepared to resort to violence."&lt;ref name="Pinker Angels" /&gt;{{rp|638–39}} But for the third group, the proposed two-state solution was "augmented with a purely symbolic declaration by the enemy in which it compromised on one of its sacred values."

In the deal presented to Israeli settlers, the Palestinians "would give up any claims to their right of return" or "would be required to recognize the historic and legitimate right of the Jewish people to Eretz Israel";&lt;ref name="Pinker Angels" /&gt;{{rp|639}} in that presented to the Palestinians, Israel "would recognize the historic and legitimate right of the Palestinians to their own state and would apologize for all wrongs done to the Palestinian people," or would "give up what they believe is their sacred right to the West Bank" or would "symbolically recognize the historic legitimacy of the right of return [without in fact granting it]".&lt;ref name="sacred bounds" /&gt; In summarizing the result, cognitive psychologist [[Steven Pinker]] claims, "Unlike the bribes of money or peace, the symbolic concession of a sacred value by the enemy, especially when it acknowledges a sacred value on one's own side, reduced the absolutists' anger, disgust, and willingness to endorse violence."&lt;ref name="Pinker Angels" /&gt;{{rp|639}}

In a study of Middle East leaders published in [[Science (journal)]], Atran interviewed leaders, as distinct from popular views. In the earlier responses, people rejected material concessions without symbolic concessions, but were open to negotiations that started with symbolic concessions. Leaders responded the same way, except that they saw the symbolic concession as only an introduction to significant material concessions as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Atran |first=Scott |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/317/5841/1039 |title=Sacred Barriers to Conflict Resolution |work=American Association for the Advancement of Science |date=August 24, 2007 |accessdate=January 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, when the researchers asked [[Musa Abu Marzouk]], deputy chairman of Hamas, about a trade-off for peace without granting a right of return, he said “No.” When he was offered a trade-off with a substantial material incentive, he said “No” even more emphatically; “we do not sell ourselves for any amount.” But when he was offered an apology, he said “Yes,” although an apology would only be a beginning. “Our houses and land were taken away from us and something has to be done about that.”

Similarly, when the researchers asked [[Binyamin Netanyahu]] (then opposition leader), “Would you seriously consider accepting a two-state solution following the 1967 borders if all major Palestinian factions, including Hamas, were to recognize the right of the Jewish people to an independent state in the region?” he said, “Yes, but the Palestinians would have to show that they sincerely mean it, change their textbooks and anti-Semitic characterizations and then allow some border adjustments so that Ben Gurion [Airport] would be out of range of shoulder-fired missiles.”

====Field research on terrorism====
His work on the ideology and social evolution of transnational terrorism, which has included fieldwork with [[mujahedin]] and supporters in Europe, the Middle East, Central and Southeast Asia, and North Africa, has challenged common assumptions. Cognitive psychologist [[Steven Pinker]] summarizes some of Atran's findings thus: 
{{quote|Far from being ignorant, impoverished, nihilistic, or mentally ill, suicide terrorists tend to be educated, middle class, morally engaged, and free of obvious psychopathology. Atran concluded that many of the motives may be found in nepotistic altruism... [Atran shows that] [[Hamas]] and other Palestinian terrorist groups [hold] out a carrot rather than a stick to the terrorist's family in the form of generous monthly stipends, lump-sum payments, and massive prestige in the community.... Atran has [also] found that suicide terrorists can be recruited without these direct incentives. Probably the most effective call to martyrdom is the opportunity to join a happy band of brothers. Terrorist cells often begin as gangs of underemployed single young men who come together in cafes, dorms, soccer clubs, barbershops, or Internet chat rooms and suddenly find meaning in their lives by a commitment to the new platoon.... Commitment to the group is intensified by religion, not just the literal promise of paradise but the feeling of spiritual awe that comes from submerging oneself in a crusade, a calling, a vision quest, or a jihad. [Atran writes that religion] may also turn a commitment to a cause into a sacred value — a good that may not be traded off against something else, including life itself. The commitment can be further stoked by the thirst for revenge, which in the case of militant Islamism takes the form of vengeance for the harm and humiliation suffered by any Muslim anywhere on the planet at any time in history, or for symbolic affronts such as the presence of infidel soldiers on sacred Muslim soil.&lt;ref name="Pinker Angels" /&gt;{{rp|356–57}} }}

Atran has summarized his work and conclusions: 
{{quote|When you look at young people like the ones who grew up to blow up trains in Madrid in 2004, carried out the slaughter on the London underground in 2005, hoped to blast airliners out of the sky en route to the United States in 2006 and 2009, and journeyed far to die killing infidels in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen or Somalia; when you look at whom they idolize, how they organize, what bonds them and what drives them; then you see that what inspires the most lethal terrorists in the world today is not so much the Koran or religious teachings as a thrilling cause and call to action that promises glory and esteem in the eyes of friends, and through friends, eternal respect and remembrance in the wider world that they will never live to enjoy.... Jihad is an egalitarian, equal-opportunity employer: ...fraternal, fast-breaking, thrilling, glorious, and cool.| Scott Atran, Testimony before U.S. Senate&lt;ref name="Pinker Angels" /&gt;{{rp|357–58}} }}

Regarding Atran's analysis of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] as a revolutionary movement of "world-historic proportions,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Atran |first=Scott |url=https://aeon.co/essays/why-isis-has-the-potential-to-be-a-world-altering-revolution |title=ISIS is a Revolution |work=AEON |date=December 15, 2016 |accessdate=February 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Atran |first=Scott |url=https://instagloss.com/read/tempsreel.nouvelobs.com-monde-20160129.obs3681-l-etat-islamique-est-une-revolution-par-scott-atran.html |title=L'Etat islamique est une révolution, par Scott Atran |work=L'OBS |language= French| date=February 2, 2016 |accessdate=February 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a writer for ''The New York Times'' considers Atran: 
{{quote|...a top anthropologist in Paris [who has combined] his research among disaffected youth with insights from such disparate figures as Hitler, Burke, Darwin and Hobbes, as well as close observation of the Islamic State’s advance into a 'globe-spanning jihadi archipelago'. He argues that we dismiss ISIS at our peril, and that in fact, we do much to promote its growth. Some of his historical conclusions will be controversial, but this is French intellectualism at its most profound — and most useful. Here’s a telling anecdote: When [[Charlie Chaplin]] and the French filmmaker [[René Clair]] watched '[[Triumph of the Will]]' (1935), [[Leni Riefenstahl]]’s visual paean to National Socialism, 'Chaplin laughed but Clair was terror-stricken, fearing that, if it were shown more widely, all might be lost in the West'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nordland |first=Ron |url= http://news.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/12/what-were-reading-120/ |title=The Allure of ISIS |work=The New York Times  |date=January 12, 2016 |accessdate=February 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] accompanied Atran to frontlines in the battle against ISIS in Iraq, where he and his research team were assessing "will to fight" among the combatants: 
{{quote|Atran  fleshes out what he calls the 'Devoted Actor Framework' [as opposed to standard 'rational actor' frameworks], which pulls sacred values [which are immune to material trade offs] and identity fusion [complete merging of individual identity with group identity] into a single theory and offers advice for beating ISIS: 'The science suggests that sacred values are best opposed with other sacred values that inspire devotion, or by sundering the fused social networks that embed those values.' Left unspoken: How do you offer an equally inspiring alternative? By what method can those social networks be sundered? Atran doesn’t pretend to know the answer, but he does think that current attempts at so-called "countermessaging" are destined to fail because those messages are 'disembodied from the social networks in which ideas are embedded and given life.' Scholarly squabbles aside, there is near-universal admiration, bordering on awe, for how Atran is able to collect data in the midst of a violent conflict."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bartlett |first=Tom |url=http://chronicle.com/article/The-Scientist-Who-Talks-to/236521 |title=The Road to ISIS: An unorthodox anthropologist goes face to face with ISIS.

A series of experimental studies directed by Atran and social psychologist Ángel Gómez&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0193-3 |title=The devoted actor’s will to fight and the spiritual dimension of human conflict |journal=Nature Human Behaviour |year=2017 |volume=1 |doi=10.1038/s41562-017-0193-3 |pages=673–679 | last1 = Gómez | first1 = Ángel | last2 = López-Rodríguez | first2 = Lucía | last3 = Sheikh | first3 = Hammad | last4 = Ginges | first4 = Jeremy | last5 = Wilson | first5 = Lydia | last6 = Waziri | first6 = Hoshang | last7 = Vázquez | first7 = Alexandra | last8 = Davis | first8 = Richard | last9 = Atran | first9 = Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt; performed with captured ISIS fighters, fighters of the Kurdistan Workers Party ([[PKK]]), [[Peshmerga]], Iraq Army and Arab Sunni Militia in Iraq, as well as with thousands of ordinary European citizens, have further elaborated the Devoted Actor framework in an effort to “help to inform policy decisions for the common defense.” According to reporting from ''CNN'':
{{quote|The researchers discovered that three crucial factors motivate both ISIS fighters and those fighting them: a deep commitment to sacred values, the readiness to forsake family for those values, and the perceived spiritual strength of the group or community that the fighter represents. [But] 'in our material world, we have underestimated or underplayed the spiritual dimension of human action,' [Atran] said. 'Doing so runs the risk of leaving ourselves open to people who are motivated by deeper spiritual and sacred values and virtues, and I think that's the greatest danger we face.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Howard |first=Jacqueline |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/09/04/health/isis-fighters-human-behavior-study/index.html |title=What motivates ISIS fighters -- and those who fight against them |work=CNN  |date=September 4, 2017 |accessdate=September 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Atran argues in an interview in ''The Washington Post'' that: "Never in history have so few people with so few means caused so much fear."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gebelhoff |first=Robert |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/in-theory/wp/2017/02/03/rethinking-the-war-on-terror-with-the-help-of-science/ |title=Rethinking the war on terrorism, with the help of science |work=The Washington Post  |date=February 3, 2017 |accessdate=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and his research colleagues at ARTIS International contend that: 
{{quote|Despite intense efforts by intelligence agencies and countless conferences, articles, and books, fundamental aspects of terrorism remain unclear: What identifies terrorists before they act; how do they radicalize; what motivates their violence; when do they act; what countermeasures are most effective? These efforts to find answers have fallen short in part because... policymakers tend to fit such information to prevailing paradigms in foreign policy, military doctrine, and criminal justice, each with serious drawbacks when applied to terrorism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://science.sciencemag.org/content/355/6323/352 |title=Challenges in researching terrorism from the field | first1= Scott| last1= Atran| first2= Robert| last2= Axelrod| first3= Richard| last3= Davis| first4= Baruch| last4= Fischhoff |work=Science |date=January 27, 2017 |accessdate=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Atran and colleagues propose an alternative approach, driven by theoretically-framed field research that ground-truths big data and informs policy-making while maintaining intellectual independence. In 2017, Atran co-authored a groundbreaking paper with Angel Gomez, Lucia Lopez-Rodriguez, Hammad Sheikh, Jeremy Ginges, Lydia Wilson, Hoshang Waziri, Alexandra Vazquez, and Richard Davis. Titled 'The Devoted Actor's Will to Fight and the Spiritual Dimension of Human Conflict',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gómez|first=Ángel|last2=López-Rodríguez|first2=Lucía|last3=Sheikh|first3=Hammad|last4=Ginges|first4=Jeremy|last5=Wilson|first5=Lydia|last6=Waziri|first6=Hoshang|last7=Vázquez|first7=Alexandra|last8=Davis|first8=Richard|last9=Atran|first9=Scott|date=September 2017|title=The devoted actor’s will to fight and the spiritual dimension of human conflict|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0193-3|journal=Nature Human Behaviour|language=En|volume=1|issue=9|pages=673–679|doi=10.1038/s41562-017-0193-3|issn=2397-3374}}&lt;/ref&gt; the piece focuses on the spiritual dimensions of conflict based upon field work in Iraq with combatants and lab studies, assessing non-utilitarian dimensions of conflict.

{{Sex and the Law}}
A '''sodomy law''' is a law that defines certain [[Human sexual activity|sexual acts]] as [[Sex and the law|crimes]]. The precise sexual acts meant by the term ''[[sodomy]]'' are rarely spelled out in the law, but are typically understood by courts to include any sexual act deemed to be "unnatural" or immoral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Weeks | first = Jeff | title =Sex, Politics and Society: The Regulation of Sexuality Since 1800 | publisher = Longman Publishing Group |date=January 1981 | location = London | isbn = 0-582-48334-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sodomy typically includes [[anal sex]], [[oral sex]], and [[zoophilia|bestiality]].&lt;ref name="Phelps"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shirelle Phelps|title=World of Criminal Justice: N-Z|publisher=[[Gale (publisher)|Gale Group]]|year=2001|page=686|isbn =0787650730|accessdate=January 13, 2014|url=https://books.google.com/?id=izwvAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=World+of+Criminal+Justice:+N-Z.&amp;dq=World+of+Criminal+Justice:+N-Z.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scheb"&gt;{{cite book|authors=John Scheb, John Scheb, II|title=Criminal Law and Procedure|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|year=2013|page=185|isbn =128554613X|accessdate=January 13, 2014|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VZoWAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA185&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Newton"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Newton|title=Gay and Lesbian Rights: A Reference Handbook, Second Edition|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|year=2009|page=85|isbn =1598843079|accessdate=January 13, 2014|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gjcUFK4RZNcC&amp;pg=PA85&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, sodomy laws have rarely been enforced against [[heterosexual]] couples, and have mostly been used to target [[homosexuals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tnr.com/article/unnatural-law| title=Unnatural Law |last=Sullivan |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Sullivan |date=2003-03-24 |work=The New Republic |accessdate=2009-11-27 |quote=Since the laws had rarely been enforced against heterosexuals, there was no sense of urgency about their repeal.}} (Or {{cite journal |last=Sullivan |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Sullivan|title=Unnatural Law |journal=The New Republic |volume=228 |issue=11 |date=2003-03-24}})&lt;/ref&gt;

As of August 2016, 72 countries as well as five sub-national jurisdictions{{efn| These five sub-national jurisdictions are: the provinces of Aceh and South Sumatra (Indonesia), the Cook Islands (New Zealand), Gaza (Palestine) and Marawi City (the Philippines).}} have laws criminalizing homosexuality,&lt;ref name="ILGA"/&gt; with most of them located in the [[Muslim world]]. In 2006 that number was 92.&lt;ref name="ILGA"/&gt;
In 2011, the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] passed an [[LGBT rights]] resolution, which was followed up by a report published by the UN Human Rights Commissioner which included scrutinisation of the mentioned codes.

{{refimprove section|date=September 2011}}

===Criminalization===
The Middle [[Assyria]]n Law Codes (1075 BC) state: If a man has intercourse with his brother-in-arms, they shall turn him into a [[eunuch]]. This is the earliest known law condemning the act of male-to-male intercourse in the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/1075assyriancode.html|title=The Code of the Assura, c. 1075 BCE|publisher=|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Roman Republic]], the ''[[Lex Scantinia]]'' imposed penalties on those who committed a sex crime ''([[stuprum]])'' against a [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Sexuality and children|freeborn male minor]]. The law may also have been used to prosecute male citizens who willingly played the [[Homosexuality in ancient Rome|passive role in same-sex acts]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A.J. McGinn, ''Prostitution, Sexuality and the Law in Ancient Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 1998), pp. 140–141; Amy Richlin, ''The Garden of Priapus: Sexuality and Aggression in Roman Humor'' (Oxford University Press, 1983, 1992), pp. 86, 224; John Boswell, ''Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality: Gay People in Western Europe from the Beginning of the Christian Era to the Fourteenth Century'' (University of Chicago Press, 1980), pp. 63, 67–68; Craig Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality: Ideologies of Masculinity in Classical Antiquity'' (Oxford University Press, 1999), p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; The law was mentioned in literary sources but enforced infrequently; [[Domitian]] revived it during his program of judicial and moral reform.&lt;ref&gt;James L.

Starting in the 12th Century, the Roman Catholic Church launched a massive campaign against sodomites, especially homosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1ha9GgWNmy0C&amp;pg=PA372&amp;lpg=PA372&amp;dq=fourth%20lateran%20council%20homosexuality&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MLMEl8q-Gm&amp;sig=F6FJzjwOj8hpSANdMT1Hil77MKw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjx4K6N-qvQAhUKK8AKHZvRDjUQ6AEILTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=fourth%20lateran%20council%20homosexuality&amp;f=false|title=The Origins and Role of Same-Sex Relations in Human Societies|first=James|last=Neill|date=27 October 2008|publisher=McFarland|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Between the years 1250 and 1300, homosexual activity was radically criminalized in most of Europe, even punishable by death.&lt;ref&gt;John Boswell, Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality (1980) p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[England]], [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] introduced the first legislation under English criminal law against sodomy with the [[Buggery Act of 1533]], making [[buggery]] punishable by [[hanging]], a penalty not lifted until 1861.

Following Sir [[William Blackstone]]'s ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/blackstone/bk4ch15.htm|work=Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England|title=Book the Fourth – Chapter the Fifteenth: Of Offences Against the Persons of Individuals|accessdate=2006-08-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907230432/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/blackstone/bk4ch15.htm|archivedate=7 September 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the crime of sodomy has often been defined only as the "abominable and detestable crime against nature", or some variation of the phrase.  This language led to widely varying rulings about what specific acts were encompassed by its prohibition.

===Decriminalization===
In 1786 [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Pietro Leopoldo of Tuscany]], abolishing [[death penalty]] for all crimes, became not only the first Western ruler to do so, but also the first ruler to abolish death penalty for sodomy (which was replaced by prison and hard labour).

In [[France]], it was the French Revolutionary penal code (issued in 1791) which for the first time struck down "sodomy" as a crime, decriminalizing it together with all "victimless-crimes" (sodomy, heresy, witchcraft, blasphemy), according with the concept that if there was no victim, there was no crime. The same principle was held true in the [[French Penal Code of 1810|Napoleon Penal Code]] in 1810, which was imposed on the large part of Europe then ruled by the [[French Empire (1804–1815)|French Empire]] and its cognate kings, thus decriminalizing sodomy in most of Continental Europe.

In 1830, Emperor [[Pedro I of Brazil]] signed a law into the Imperial Penal Code. It eliminates all references to sodomy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brazzil.com/blamar00.htm ''Beyond Carnival'']. Green, James. [[The University of Chicago Press]]. 1999. {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Ottoman Empire]], homosexuality was decriminalized in 1858 as part of wider reforms during the [[Tanzimat]] period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faith-matters.org/images/stories/fm-publications/the-tanzimat-final-web.pdf|title=The Tanzimat: Secular Reforms in the Ottoman Empire|author=Ishtiaq Hussain|publisher=Faith Matters|date=15 Feb 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-25927595 |title=Where is it illegal to be gay? |accessdate=25 January 2015 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The death penalty was not lifted in England and Wales until 1861.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In 1917, following the Bolshevik Revolution led by [[V.I. Lenin]] and [[Leon Trotsky]], [[Russia]] legalized homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hazard |first1=John N. |title=Unity and Diversity in Socialist Law |journal=Law and Contemporary Problems |publisher=Duke Law |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=270–290 |url=https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3056&amp;context=lcp |accessdate=21 Jan 2015 |doi=10.2307/1190515 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when [[Joseph Stalin]] came to power in 1920's, these laws were reversed until homosexuality was effectively made illegal again by the government.&lt;ref&gt;West, Green. [https://books.google.com/books?id=AwD3FNUJjXwC&amp;pg=PA223#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Sociolegal Control of Homosexuality: A Multi-Nation Comparison'']. p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Soviet legislation does not recognize so-called crimes against morality. Our laws proceed from the principle of protection of society and therefore countenance punishment only in those instances when juveniles and minors are the objects of homosexual interest ... while recognizing the incorrectness of homosexual development ... our society combines prophylactic and other therapeutic measures with all the necessary conditions for making the conflicts that afflict homosexuals as painless as possible and for resolving their typical estrangement from society within the collective
:—Sereisky, ''Great Soviet Encyclopedia'', 1930, p. 593&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[First Czechoslovak Republic]] (1918–1938), there was a movement to repeal sodomy laws. It has been claimed that this was the first campaign to repeal anti-gay laws that was spearheaded primarily by heterosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Himl |first1=Pavel |title=Oponentský posudek rigorózní práce Jana Seidla „Úsilí o odtrestnění homosexuality za první republiky“ |url=https://is.muni.cz/th/64594/ff_r/hi_seidl_himl.txt |accessdate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the publishing of the [[Wolfenden report]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], which asserted that "homosexual behaviour between consenting adults in private should no longer be a criminal offence", many western governments, including many U.S. states, have repealed laws specifically against homosexual acts. However by 2003, 13 U.S. states still criminalized homosexuality, along with many Missouri counties, and the territory of Puerto Rico, but in June 2003, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' that [[U.S. state|state]] laws criminalizing private, non-commercial sexual activity between consenting adults at home on the grounds of morality are unconstitutional since there is insufficient justification for intruding into people's liberty and privacy.

As of 2018, sodomy related laws have been repealed or judicially struck down in all of Europe, North America, and South America, except for Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.

There have never been Western-style sodomy related laws in the People's Republic of China, Taiwan, North Korea, South Korea, or Vietnam. Additionally, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia were part of the French colony of [[French Indochina|'Indochine']]; so if there had been any laws against male homosexual acts in those countries, they would have been dismantled by French colonial authorities, since male homosexual acts have been legal in France and throughout the French Empire since the issuing of the aforementioned French Revolutionary penal code in 1791.

===Criminalization in modern days===
This trend among Western nations has not been followed in all other regions of the world (Africa, some parts of Asia, Oceania and even western countries in the Caribbean Islands), where sodomy often remains a serious crime. For example, male homosexual acts, at least in theory, can result in life imprisonment in Barbados and Guyana.

In Africa, male homosexual acts remain punishable by death in Mauritania, Sudan, and some parts of Nigeria and Somalia.  Male and sometimes female homosexual acts are minor to major criminal offences in many other African countries; for example, life imprisonment is a prospective penalty in Sierra Leone, Tanzania and Uganda. A notable exception is South Africa, where same-sex marriage is legal.

In Asia, male homosexual acts remain punishable by death in Brunei, Iran, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. Additionally, life imprisonment is the formal penalty for male homosexual acts in Bangladesh, the Maldives, Myanmar, Pakistan, and Qatar. But anti-sodomy laws have been repealed in Israel (which recognises but does not perform same-sex marriages), Japan, Kazakhstan, the Philippines, and Thailand.

== Sodomy-related legal positions by country ==

=== Australia ===
{{Main article|LGBT rights in Australia}}

Upon colonisation in 1788, Australia inherited laws from the United Kingdom including the [[Buggery Act]] of 1533.  These were retained in the criminal codes passed by the various colonial parliaments during the 19th century, and by the state parliaments after [[Federation]].&lt;ref name=carbery&gt;{{cite journal |last=Carbery |first=Graham |title=Towards Homosexual Equality in Australian Criminal Law: A Brief History |year=2010 |edition=2nd |issue= |pages= |url=http://www.alga.org.au/files/towardsequality2ed.pdf |publisher=Australian Lesbian and Gay Archives Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Wolfenden report]], the [[Don Dunstan|Dunstan]] [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government introduced a ''consenting adults in private'' type legal defence in South Australia in 1972. This defence was initiated as a bill by Murray Hill, father of former [[Defence Minister]] [[Robert Hill (Australian politician)|Robert Hill]], and repealed the state's sodomy law in 1975.  The [[Campaign Against Moral Persecution]] during the 1970s raised the profile and acceptance of Australia's gay and lesbian communities, and other states and territories repealed their laws between 1976 and 1990. The exception was [[Tasmania]], which retained its laws until the [[Government of Australia|Federal Government]] and the United Nations [[Human Rights Committee]] forced their repeal in 1997.

Male homosexuality was decriminalised in the [[Australian Capital Territory]] in 1976, then [[Norfolk Island]] in 1993, following South Australia in 1975 and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] in 1981. At the time of legalization (for the above), the age of consent, rape, defences, etc. were all set gender-neutral and equal {{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}. Western Australia legalised male homosexuality in 1989 – Under the ''Law Reform (Decriminalization of Sodomy) Act 1989'', as did [[New South Wales]] and the [[Northern Territory]] in 1984 with unequal ages of consent of 18 for [[New South Wales]] and the [[Northern Territory]] and 21 for Western Australia. Then since 1997, the states and territories that retained different ages of consent or other vestiges of sodomy laws have tended to repeal them later; Western Australia did so in 2002, and [[New South Wales]] and the [[Northern Territory]] did so in 2003. [[Tasmania]] was the last state to decriminalise sodomy, doing so in 1997 after the groundbreaking cases of [[Toonen v Australia]] and [[Croome v Tasmania]] (it is also notable that Tasmania was the first jurisdiction to recognize same-sex couples in Australia since 2004 under the ''Relationships Act 2003''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/tas/consol_act/ra2003173/|title=RELATIONSHIPS ACT 2003|publisher=|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) In 2016 Queensland became the final Australian jurisdiction to equalise its [[age of consent]] for all forms of sexual activity at 16 years, after reducing the age of consent for [[anal sex]] from 18 years.&lt;ref name="archaic-end"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Burke|first1=Gail|title=Queensland lowers anal sex consent age to 16, ending 'archaic' law|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-15/queensland-standardises-age-of-consent-laws-anal-sex/7850112|accessdate=17 September 2016|work=ABC News|agency=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=15 September 2016|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brazil ===
{{Main article|LGBT rights in Brazil|Legal status of homosexuality in Brazil}}
Brazilian criminal law does not punish any sexual act performed by consenting adults, but allows for prosecution, under statutory rape laws, when one of the participants is under 14 years of age and the other an adult, as per Articles 217-A of the Brazilian Penal Code. Pedophilic acts are also criminalized by the Children and Teenager Statute, in articles 241-A to 241-E.
Article 235 of the Brazilian Military Criminal Code – DL 1.001/69-, however, does incriminate any contact deemed to be libidinous,  be it of a homosexual nature or not, made in any location subject to military administration. Since the article is entitled ''Of pederasty or other libidinous acts'', gay rights advocates claim that, since the Brazilian armed forces are composed almost exclusively of males,  the article allows for witch-hunts against homosexuals in the military service. This article of the Military Criminal Code is under scrutiny by the Brazilian Supreme Court (ADPF 291).

=== Canada ===
{{Main article|LGBT rights in Canada}}
Before 1859, the [[Province of Canada]] prosecuted sodomy under the English Buggery Act.  In 1859, the Province of Canada enacted its own [[buggery]] law in the Consolidated Statutes of Canada as an offence punishable by death.  Buggery remained punishable by death until 1869.  A broader law targeting all homosexual male sexual activity ("gross indecency") was passed in 1892, as part of a larger update to the criminal law of the new dominion of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Code, 1892, SC 1892, c 29&lt;/ref&gt;  Changes to the ''[[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]]'' in 1948 and 1961 were used to brand gay men as "criminal sexual psychopaths" and "dangerous sexual offenders."  These labels provided for indeterminate prison sentences.  Most famously, [[George Klippert]], a homosexual, was labelled a dangerous sexual offender and sentenced to life in prison, a sentence confirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/4738/index.do?r=AAAAAQAFeW91dGgAAAAAAAAB|title=Klippert v. The Queen - SCC Cases (Lexum)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was released in 1971.

Sodomy was decriminalized after the ''[[Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1968-69]]'' (Bill C-150) received royal assent on June 27, 1969. The offences of buggery and "gross indecency" were still in force, however the new act introduced exemptions for married couples, and any two consenting adults above the age of 21 regardless of gender or sexual orientation. The bill had been originally introduced in the House of Commons in 1967 by then Minister of Justice [[Pierre Trudeau]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Journals of the House of Commons |volume=CXV |year=1968–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; who famously stated that "there's no place for the state in the bedrooms of the nation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Pierre Trudeau |date=1967-12-21 |title=The CBC Digital Archives Website |url=http://archives.cbc.ca/politics/rights_freedoms/clip/2671/|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=2008-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Revisions to the ''Criminal Code'' in 1987 repealed the offence of "gross indecency", changed "buggery" to "anal intercourse" and reduced the age exemption from 21 to 18.&lt;ref&gt;''An Act to amend the Criminal Code and the Canada Evidence Act'', R.S.C. 1985 (3d Supp.), c. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Section 159 of the ''Criminal Code'' continues to criminalize anal sex, with exemptions for husbands and wives, and two consenting parties above the age of 18, provided no more than two people are present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-73.html#docCont|title=Criminal Code (R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46)|publisher=Department of Justice Canada|date=23 April 2012|accessdate=29 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent [[case law]] has held that section 159 is [[constitutionality|unconstitutional]], thus anal sex is ''de facto'' legal between any two or more [[Consent to sexual activity|consenting]] persons above the [[age of consent]] (16). In the 1995 [[Court of Appeal for Ontario]] case ''R. v. M. (C.)'' the judges ruled that the law was unconstitutional on the basis that the specific exemptions based on marital status and age infringed on the [[social equality|equality rights]] guaranteed by [[Section Fifteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 15]] of the [[Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], and constituted discrimination based on sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qrd.org/qrd/world/legal/youth.sodomy.law.ruling.txt |title=Ontario Youth Sodomy Law Ruling |date= |accessdate=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar decision was made by the [[Quebec Court of Appeal]] in the 1998 case ''R. v.

The [[Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta]] declared section 159 in its entirety to be null, including the provisions criminalizing the act when more than two persons are taking part or present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abqb/doc/2002/2002abqb145/2002abqb145.html|title=R. v.

[[New Democratic Party|NDP]] [[member of parliament|MP]] [[Joe Comartin]] introduced [[private member's bill]]s in 2007 and 2011 to repeal section 159 of the ''Criminal Code'', however neither passed first reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;DocId=2896522&amp;File=4|title=Bill C-438: An Act to amend the Criminal Code (consent)|date=2 May 2007|accessdate=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;DocId=4952816&amp;File=4|title=Bill C-628: An Act to amend the Criminal Code (consent)|date=11 February 2011|accessdate=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chile===

Consensual sex between two same-sex adults was decriminalized in 1999. It is still banned if one of the persons is below the age of 18, however, even though the age of consent is 14.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.derecho.uchile.cl/cej/rej14/ABR%20VVAA%20_4_x.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China ===
{{Main article|LGBT rights in China}}
Sodomy was never explicitly criminalized in China. The [[Chinese Supreme Court]] ruled in 1957 that voluntary sodomy was not a criminal act.&lt;ref name=zhlaw&gt;http://www.law-lib.com/Law/law_view.asp?id=1218 最高人民法院关于成年人间自愿鸡奸是否犯罪问题的批复&lt;/ref&gt; Private sex in any form between two consenting adults does not violate laws.

In a notable case in 2002, a man who had anal intercourse with a teenager was sentenced to three and a half years in prison. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

=== Denmark ===
{{Main article|LGBT rights in Denmark}}
In 1933 Denmark became the third country in Europe to fully legalize homosexuality. The age of consent has been set at 15 since 1977.

=== France ===
{{Main article|LGBT rights in France}}
Since the [[Penal Code of 1791]], France has not had laws punishing homosexual conduct ''per se'' between over-age consenting adults in private. However, other qualifications such as "offense to good mores" were occasionally retained in the 19th century ''(see [[Jean Jacques Régis de Cambacérès]])''.

In 1960, a [[:fr:Amendement Mirguet|parliamentary amendment]] by {{ill|Paul Mirguet|fr}} added homosexuality to a list of "social scourges", along with alcoholism and prostitution. This prompted the government to increase the penalties for public display of a sex act when the act was homosexual. [[transvestism|Transvestites]] or homosexuals caught [[Cruising for sex|cruising]] were also the target of police repression.

In 1981, the 1960 law making homosexuality an aggravating circumstance for public indecency was repealed.  Then in 1982, under president [[François Mitterrand]], the law from 1942 ([[Vichy France]]) making the age of consent for homosexual sex higher (18) than for heterosexual sex (15) was also repealed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jopdf/common/jo_pdf.jsp?numJO=0&amp;dateJO=19820805&amp;numTexte=&amp;pageDebut=02502&amp;pageFin=|title=Fac-similé JO du 05/08/1982, page 02502 - Legifrance|publisher=|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite the vocal opposition of [[Jean Foyer]] in the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.assemblee-nationale.fr/7/cri/1981-1982-ordinaire1/153.pdf Proceedings of the National assembly], 2nd sitting of 20 December 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===
{{Main article|LGBT rights in Germany}}
[[Paragraph 175]], which punished "[[fornication]] between men", was eased to an [[age of consent]] of 21 in [[East Germany]] in 1957 and in West Germany in 1969.  This age was lowered to 18 in the East in 1968 and the West in 1973, and all legal distinctions between [[heterosexual]] and [[homosexuality|homosexual]] acts were abolished in the East in 1988, with this change being extended to all of Germany in 1994 as part of the process of [[German Reunification]].

In modern [[German language|German]], the term ''Sodomie'' has a meaning different from the [[English language|English]] word "[[:wiktionary:sodomy|sodomy]]": it does not refer to anal sex, but acts of [[Zoophilia]]. The change occurred mostly in the middle of the 19th century, at least in the last decade of the century. Only the moral theology of the Roman Catholic church changed not until some time after World War II to the term ''homosexuality''.

{{main article|LGBT rights in Hong Kong}}
"Homosexual Buggery". Before 2014, according to the [[Crimes Ordinance]] Section 118C,&lt;ref&gt;CRIMES ORDINANCE, Chapter 200, Section 118C, [http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/200/s118c-19970630.html.html Homosexual buggery with or by man under 21], hklii.hk&lt;/ref&gt; both of the two men must be at least 16 to commit homosexual buggery legally or otherwise both of them can be liable to life imprisonment.  [http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/200/s118f-19970630.html.html Sect 118F] states that committing homosexual buggery not privately is also illegal and can be liable to imprisonment for 5 years.

"Heterosexual Buggery". A man who commits buggery with a girl under 21 can also be liable for life imprisonment ([http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/200/s118d.html Sect 118D]) while no similar laws concerning committing heterosexual buggery in private exist.

In 2005, Judge Hartmann found these 4 laws: Sect 118C, 118F, [http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/200/s118h.html 118H], and [http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/200/s118j.html 118J] were discriminatory towards gay males and unconstitutional under the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]] and contrary to the Bill of Rights Ordinance in a judicial review filed by a Hong Kong resident.  It was believed that the age of consent had been reduced from 21 to 16 for any kind of homosexual sex acts. In 2014, the ordinance was amended according to the judgement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.elegislation.gov.hk/egazettedownload?EGAZETTE_PDF_ID=11146 |title=Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance 2014 |publisher=Elegislation.gov.hk |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|LGBT rights in Hungary}}
[[Homosexuality]] in Hungary was decriminalized in 1962, [[Paragraph]] 199 of the [[Hungarian Penal Code]] from then on threatened "only" adults over 20 who engaged themselves in a consensual same-sex relationship with an underaged person between 14 and 20. Then in 1978 the age was lowered to 18. Since 2002, by the ruling of the [[Constitutional Court of Hungary]] repealed Paragraph 199 – Which provided an equal age of consent of '''14''', regardless of sexual orientation and/or gender. Since 1996, the ''Unregistered Cohabitation Act 1995'' was provided for any couple, regardless of gender and/or sexual orientation and from 1 July 2009 the ''Registered Partnership Act 2009'' becomes effective, and provides a registered partnership just for same-sex couples – since that opposite-sex already have marriage, this would in-turn create duplication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukgaynews.org.uk/marriage_timeline.htm |title=UK Gay News - Gay and Lesbian Marriage, Partnership or Unions Worldwide |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jitR7T5A?url=http://www.ukgaynews.org.uk/marriage_timeline.htm |archivedate=12 September 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|LGBT rights in Iceland}}
Homosexuality has been legal in Iceland since 1940, but equal age of consent was not approved until 1992. [[Civil union]] was legalised by [[Alþingi]] in 1996 with 44 votes pro, 1 con, 1 neutral and 17 not present. Those laws were changed to allow adoption and [[artificial insemination]] for [[lesbians]] 27 June 2006 among other things. [[Same-sex marriage in Iceland|Same-sex marriage]] was legalised in 2010.

=== India ===
{{Main article|LGBT rights in India}}
India inherited sodomy laws in its criminal code from the [[British Raj]], which were not present in its history of codified or customary legal system before. That section of Indian law, Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, called for a maximum punishment of life imprisonment for all ''carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal'' (primarily interpreted to be homosexuality, especially sodomy, including between consenting adults). This law had rarely been executed, if at all, in case of consenting adults, although sometimes was in the news when a homosexual rapist was apprehended. Police repression in alleged or real gay bars is common, and is often highlighted by the contemporary media.

On 2 July 2009, in the case of ''[[Naz Foundation v. Govt. of NCT of Delhi|Naz Foundation v National Capital Territory of Delhi]]'', the High Court of Delhi struck down much of S. 377 of the IPC as being unconstitutional. The Court held that to the extent S. 377 criminalised consensual non-vaginal sexual acts between adults, it violated an individual's fundamental rights to equality before the law, freedom from discrimination and to life and personal liberty under Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the [[Constitution of India]]. The High Court did not strike down S. 377 completely – it held the section was valid to the extent it related to non-consensual non-vaginal intercourse or to intercourse with minors – and it expressed the hope that Parliament would soon legislatively address the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jul/21/india-gay-rights-law|title=A New Law for India's Sexual Minorities|work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=21 July 2009|author=Yuvraj Joshi|accessdate=12 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

India does not recognize same-sex unions of any type. On December 11, 2013, the Supreme Court of India overturned the ruling in Naz Foundation v. National Capital Territory of Delhi, effectively re-criminalizing homosexual activity until action was taken by parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=J. |last=Venkatesan|title=Homosexuality illegal: SC|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/homosexuality-not-legal-sc/article5446939.ece|accessdate=11 December 2013|newspaper=The Hindu|date=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 12th July 2018 a Constitution bench of the Supreme Court of India started hearing a review petition over its 2013 judgment.

=== Iran ===
{{Main article|LGBT rights in Iran}}
Sodomy is illegal in Iran and is punishable by death.

=== Israel ===
{{Main article|LGBT rights in Israel}}
The State of Israel inherited its sodomy ("buggery") law from the legal code of the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]], but it was never enforced against homosexual acts that took place between consenting adults in private. In 1963, the Israeli Attorney-General declared that these laws would not be enforced. However, in certain criminal cases, defendants were convicted of "sodomy" (which includes [[oral sex]]), apparently by way of plea bargains; they had originally been indicted for more serious sexual offenses.

In the late 1960s, the [[Supreme Court of Israel|Israeli Supreme Court]] ruled that these laws could not be enforced against consenting adults. Though unenforced, these laws remained in the penal code until 1988, when they were formally repealed by the [[Knesset]]. The [[age of consent]] for both heterosexuals and homosexuals is 16 years of age.

=== Italy ===
{{Main article|LGBT rights in Italy}}
In 1786 [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Pietro Leopoldo of Tuscany]], abolishing [[death penalty]] for all crimes, became not only the first Western ruler to do so, but also the first ruler to abolish death penalty for sodomy (though this was replaced with other sentences such as terms in prison or of hard labour).

The Code Napoléon made sodomy legal between consenting adults above the legal age of consent in all Italy except in the Kingdom of Sardinia, the Austria-ruled Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia, and the Papal states.

In the newborn (1860) [[Kingdom of Italy]], Sardinia extended its legal code on the whole of Northern Italy, but not in the South, which made homosexual behaviour legal in the South and illegal in the North. However the first Italian penal code (Codice Zanardelli, 1889), decriminalised same-sex intercourse between consenting adults above the legal age of consent for all regions. A law that has not changed since it was enacted.

=== Japan ===
{{Main article|LGBT rights in Japan}}

In the [[Meiji Period]], sex between men was punishable under the sodomy laws announced in 1872 and revised in 1873. This was changed by laws announced in 1880 ([[:ja:同性愛#同性愛に関する法と政治|同性愛に関する法と政治]]). Since that time no further laws criminalizing homosexuality have been passed.

=== Macau ===
{{main article|LGBT rights in Macau}}
In [[Macau]], according to the [[Código Penal de Macau]] (''Penal Code of Macau'') [https://web.archive.org/web/20080502021527/http://www.imprensa.macau.gov.mo/bo/I/95/46/codpenpt/codpen0101.asp Article 166 &amp; 168], committing anal coitus with whomever under the age of 17 is a crime and shall be punished by imprisonment of up to 10 years (committing with whoever under 14) and 4 years (committing with whoever between 14 and 16) respectively.

=== Malaysia ===
{{Main article|LGBT rights in Malaysia}}
Sodomy is illegal in Malaysia, however still being practiced in private. The sodomy laws are sometimes enforced using Section 377 of the [[Penal Code (Malaysia)|Penal Code]] which prohibit [[carnal intercourse]] against the order of nature.

{{quote|Any person who has sexual connection with another person by the introduction of the penis into the anus or mouth of the other person is said to commit carnal intercourse against the order of nature.}}

The age of consent in Malaysia is 16. Punishment for voluntarily committing carnal intercourse against the order of nature shall be up to twenty years [[imprisonment]] and [[flagellation|whipping]] while committing the same offences but without consent, shall be punished by no less than five years imprisonment and whipping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

There was the notable case involving [[Anwar Ibrahim]], former [[Leader of the Opposition (Malaysia)|Leader of the Opposition]] and [[Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia|Deputy Prime Minister]] who was convicted of sodomy crime under Section 377B of the Penal Code. However, it is debatable how the sodomy law can be enforced consistently.

=== New Zealand ===
{{Main article|LGBT rights in New Zealand}}

New Zealand inherited the United Kingdom's sodomy laws in 1854.
The Offences Against The Person Act of 1867 changed the penalty of buggery from execution to life imprisonment for "Buggery".  In 1961 in a revision of the Crimes Act, the penalty was reduced to a maximum of 7 years between consenting adult males.

Homosexual sex was legalised in New Zealand as a result of the passage of the [[Homosexual Law Reform Act|Homosexual Law Reform Act 1986]]. The age of consent was set at 16 years, the same as for heterosexual sex.

Since 4 September 2007 two out of the three territories of New Zealand ([[Niue]] and [[Tokelau]]) legalized homosexuality with an equal age of consent as well by the [http://www.austlii.edu.au/nz/legis/consol_act/naa2007146.pdf Niue Amendment Act 2007]. [[Cook Islands]] meanwhile still has a sodomy law on the books [http://www.paclii.org/ck/legis/num_act/ca196982/ Crimes Act (1969), s153 and a155].

Poland is one of the few countries where homosexuality has never been considered a crime. Forty years after Poland [[Partitions of Poland|lost its independence]], in 1795, the sodomy laws of [[Imperial Russia|Russia]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], and [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] came into force in the occupied Polish lands. Poland retained these laws after independence in 1918, but they were never enforced, and were officially abandoned in 1932.

=== Russia ===
{{Main article|LGBT rights in Russia}}
In the past, in Russia sexual activity between males was criminalized by state law on March 4, 1934. Sexual activity between females was not mentioned in the law. On May 27, 1993, homosexual acts between consenting males were decriminalized.

=== Serbia ===
{{Main article|LGBT rights in Serbia}}
The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia later restricted the offense in 1959 to only apply to homosexual anal intercourse; but with the maximum sentence reduced from 2 to 1 year imprisonment. In 1994, male homosexual sexual intercourse was officially decriminalised in the [[Republic of Serbia (1992–2006)|Republic of Serbia]], a part of the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. The [[age of consent]] was set at 18 years for anal intercourse between males and 14 for other sexual practices. An equal age of consent of 14 was later introduced on 1 January 2006, regardless of sexual orientation or gender.

[[Sodomy]] was historically known in England and Wales as '''[[buggery]]''', and is usually interpreted as referring to anal intercourse between two males or a male and a female. In England and Wales buggery was made a [[felony]] by the [[Buggery Act]] in 1533, during the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. The punishment for those convicted was the death penalty until 1861 in England and Wales, and 1887 in Scotland. [[James Pratt and John Smith]] were the last two to be executed for sodomy in 1835. A lesser offence of "attempted buggery" was punished by 2 years of jail and some time on the [[pillory]]. In 1885, Parliament enacted the [[Labouchere Amendment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/pwh/englaw.html|title=The Law in England, 1290–1885|accessdate=2006-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; which prohibited ''gross indecency'' between males, a broad term that was understood to encompass most or all male homosexual acts. Following the [[Wolfenden report]], sexual acts between two adult males, with no other people present, were made legal in [[England and Wales]] in 1967, in Scotland in 1980, [[Northern Ireland]] in 1982, [[Crown Dependency|UK Crown Dependencies]] [[Guernsey]] in 1983, [[Jersey]] in 1990 and [[Isle of Man]] in 1992.

In the 1980s and 1990s,  [[LGBT rights in the United Kingdom|gay rights]] organizations made attempts to equalize the [[age of consent]] for heterosexuals and homosexuals, which had previously been 21 for homosexuals but only 16 for heterosexual acts. Efforts were also made to modify the "no other person present" clause so that it dealt only with minors. In 1994, Conservative MP [[Edwina Currie]] introduced an amendment to Criminal Justice and Public Order Bill which would have lowered the age of consent to 16. The amendment failed, but a compromise amendment which lowered the age of consent to 18 was accepted. The July 1, 1997 decision in the case ''[[Sutherland v. United Kingdom]]'' resulted in the [[Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000]] which further reduced it to 16, and the "no other person present" clause was modified to "no minor persons present". Today, the universal age of consent is 16 in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The Sexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisr/2008/510/contents/made|title=Sexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 2008 (Commencement) Order 2008|publisher=|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; brought Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the United Kingdom on 2 February 2009 (prior to that, the age of consent for both heterosexuals and homosexuals was 17).

Zimbabwe's President [[Robert Mugabe]] has waged a violent [[LGBT rights in Zimbabwe|campaign against homosexuals]], claiming that before colonization, Zimbabweans did not engage in homosexual acts.&lt;ref name="HOMO"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN030647770X&amp;id=ezBvVdRnWKsC&amp;pg=PA213&amp;lpg=PA213&amp;ots=6IWk0seKwp&amp;dq=Mugabe+moral+campaign+homosexuality&amp;sig=tzSDUBuYv5c6Y8admBfF-Y-Azbo Page 213] ''Encyclopedia of Sex and Gender: Men and Women in the World's Cultures''&lt;/ref&gt; His first major public condemnation of homosexuality&lt;!-- Perhaps mention a couple of the subsequent ones to cite "the first"? --&gt; came during the [[Zimbabwe International Book Fair]] in August 1995.&lt;ref name="ZIB"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0773527516&amp;id=LvxMq2hNzm0C&amp;pg=PA180&amp;lpg=PA180&amp;ots=xI8D2NLVGn&amp;dq=Mugabe+moral+campaign+homosexuality&amp;sig=-81GDIVzFqwX10TbJjaRAXlT2TE#PPA180,M1 Page 180] ''Hungochani: The History of a Dissident Sexuality in Southern Africa''&lt;/ref&gt; He told the audience that homosexuality:

'''''The Making of the Representative for Planet 8''''' is a 1982 science fiction novel by [[Doris Lessing]]. It is the fourth book in her five-book ''[[Canopus in Argos]]'' series&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dorislessing.org/canopusin.html |title=Canopus in Argos: Archives |work=dorislessing.org |accessdate=14 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and relates the fate of a planet, under the care of the benevolent galactic empire [[Canopus]], that is plunged into an [[ice age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dorislessing.org/thethe.html |title=The Making of the Representative for Planet 8 |work=dorislessing.org |accessdate=14 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first published in the United States in January 1982 by [[Alfred A. Knopf]], and in the United Kingdom in March 1982 by [[Jonathan Cape]].

[[Christopher Lehmann-Haupt]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote in a review of this book that "the effect of the story is powerful and immediate – with all the drama of good polar-exploration literature, and the eloquence, at its best, of the King James Bible."&lt;ref name=NYT-CLH&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C00E3DD1F38F93AA15752C0A964948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Books of the Times: The Making of the Representative for Planet 8 |first=Christopher |last=Lehmann-Haupt |authorlink=Christopher Lehmann-Haupt |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=14 October 2008 | date=29 January 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[John Leonard (American critic)|John Leonard]], also of The New York Times, was critical of Lessing's switch to science fiction and in a review of this book, complained that "Mrs. Lessing is no longer very interested in people. She has come to feel that individuality is a 'degenerative disease'... She seems ... to be in the process of junking not only traditional narrative and conventional characters but the details of feeling as well..."&lt;ref name=NYT-JL&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E2DE163BF934A35751C0A964948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=The Spacing Out of Doris Lessing |first=John |last=Leonard |authorlink=John Leonard (American critic) |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=14 October 2008 | date=7 February 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Making of the Representative for Planet 8'' can be read as a stand-alone book, although it does make reference to the planet ''[[Shikasta]]'', introduced in the first book of the ''Canopus'' series.

==Plot==
Planet 8 is a small [[planet|world]] that was colonised by the benevolent galactic empire [[Canopus]] and populated with a new [[species]] created from the stock of four different species originating on several other Canopean planets. Planet 8 has a warm [[Temperateness|temperate climate]] and, under Canopus's skilled guidance, the inhabitants live comfortably and at peace with themselves and their world.

One day Canopus instructs them to build a huge wall, to exact Canopean specifications, right around the girth of the planet. The construction takes the inhabitants years to complete, and when it is finished, Canopus tells the planet's representatives, leaders of each of the planet's main disciplines, to relocate all settlements north of the wall to the south. Canopus informs everyone that unfortunate interstellar "re-alignments" have taken place and that Planet 8 will soon experience an [[ice age]]. After a while temperatures start to drop and the climate begins to change. [[Glacier]]s form in the north and slowly advance towards the wall. Canopus, however, assures Planet 8 that Canopus has a new home for them, a peaceful and prosperous world called Rohanda (the subject of the first book in this series, ''[[Shikasta]]''), and that when it has reached a certain level of development, Canopus will space-lift the inhabitants of Planet 8 to Rohanda. This fills the people of Planet 8 with hope as they are forced to adapt their lifestyles to cope with this new and unfamiliar climate.

By the time the glaciers reach the wall, much of the vegetation in the south has been destroyed by snow and ice and conditions grow worse. Conflict breaks out amongst the erstwhile peaceful villagers as food becomes scarce. But the wall holds the glaciers back and the people still remain resolute in their faith that Canopus will rescue them. Then Canopean agent Johor (first introduced in ''Shikasta'') arrives on Planet 8 with the devastating news that disaster has struck Rohanda: it has been renamed Shikasta (the stricken) and is no longer available for re-settlement. But Johor does not leave Planet 8. He remains to endure the hardships with the villagers and does what he can to help them face their inevitable demise.

In time, when the population is now faced with starvation, the wall, which was only a temporary barrier, gives way and the glaciers start over-running settlements in the south. The senior representatives, at a loss as to what to do, head north over the wall and onto the glacier. Johor travels with them as they try to reach the [[Geographical pole|pole]], but they soon all succumb to cold and hunger. Their physical bodies perish, but their "[[being]]s" rise and merge into a single [[consciousness]] that becomes the Representative for Planet 8 and all its memories. After watching Planet 8 freeze over completely, the Representative departs for a place "where Canopus tends and guards and instructs."{{sfn|Lessing|1994|loc=p. 161}}

==Afterword==
The book contains a 30-page [[afterword]] in which Lessing states that ''The Making of the Representative for Planet 8'' and the previous book in this series, ''[[The Sirian Experiments]]'' were inspired by her 50-year fascination in the ill-fated [[Terra Nova Expedition|1910–13 Antarctic expedition]] of [[Robert Falcon Scott]],&lt;ref name=NYT-CLH/&gt; though not, she points out, by the element of ice and polar conditions in itself.{{sfn|Lessing|1994|loc="Afterword", p. 162}}

Lessing expresses a concern that Scott and his explorers, heroes in their day, were vilified by recent generations. She analyses the disastrous expedition and the changes as to how it, and Scott himself, have been viewed by posterity, and discusses these changes in the popular views of the journey in connection with the changing fashions of thought and the decline of imperialist ideas. The efforts of Scott and his men, she concludes, should be understood as a deliberate wager with destiny rather than a scientific project: they tried to transcend themselves by taking on responsibilities they knew they might not be fully equipped for or experienced enough to handle, which ultimately cost many of them their lives. Lessing explicitly likens this view of the pride in sacrifice and self-transcending to the expectations and propaganda imagery of the [[First World War]] soon after.{{sfn|Lessing|1994|loc="Afterword", p. 162}}

==Adaptations==
*''[[The Making of the Representative for Planet 8 (opera)|The Making of the Representative for Planet 8]]'' (opera, 1986)

''The Making of the Representative for Planet 8'' was adapted for the opera in 1986 by composer [[Philip Glass]] with [[libretto|story-libretto]] by [[Doris Lessing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chesternovello.com/Default.aspx?TabId=2431&amp;State_2905=2&amp;composerId_2905=540 |title=Philip Glass |work=Chester Music and Novello &amp; Company |accessdate=14 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three-act opera, for orchestra, small chorus and soloists was commissioned by the [[Houston Grand Opera]], the [[English National Opera]] and the Landestheater Kiel in Germany.

The premiere received a lukewarm review by ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' music critic [[John Rockwell]].&lt;ref name=Rockwell&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/11/arts/reviews-music-new-opera-by-lessing-and-glass.html | title = Reviews/Music; New Opera By Lessing And Glass | first = John | last = Rockwell | work = The New York Times | date=11 July 1988 | accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Glass adapted another of Lessing's books from this series for the opera, ''[[The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four and Five]]''.

The '''theory of indispensable attributes''' ('''TIA''') is a theory in the context of [[perceptual organization|perceptual organisation]] which asks for the functional units and elementary features that are relevant for a [[perceptual system]] in the constitution of perceptual objects. Earlier versions of the theory emerged in the context of an application of research on [[Visual system|vision]] to [[Auditory system|audition]], and analogies between vision and audition were emphasised,&lt;ref&gt;Kubovy, Michael: Concurrent-Pitch Segregation and the Theory of Indispensable Attributes. In: Kubovy, Michael/Pomeranz, James R. (Eds.): Perceptual Organization, Hillsdale, N.J.: Lawrence Erlbaum, 1981, 55–98.&lt;/ref&gt;
whereas in more recent writings the necessity of a [[Sensory modality|modality-general]] theory of perceptual organisation and objecthood is stressed.&lt;ref&gt;Kubovy, Michael/Valkenburg, D. Van: ''In defense of the theory of indispensable attributes.'' Cognition 87, 2003, pp. 225–233, here: p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;

The subject of perceptual organisation, and with it TIA, constitute a prime example of how theories of [[Gestalt psychology]]  have been taken up and kept alive in [[cognitive psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;Kubovy, Michael (1999): ''Gestalt Psychology''. In: Robert A. Wilson/Frank C. Keil (Eds.), The MIT Encyclopedia of the Cognitive Sciences, pp. 346–349.&lt;/ref&gt;

TIA has been drawn on in the context of music research, in the areas of music philosophy,&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Charles O. (2007): ''The Musical Representation. Meaning, Ontology, and Emotion'', Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, pp. 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt;
and systematic music theory.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Schmidt, Lüder/Schmidt, Silke/Seifert, Uwe/Gernemann, Andreas: ''Perceptual Organization and Systematic Music Theory: Musical Surface, Auditory Objects, and the Theory of Indispensable Attributes.'' In: Proceedings of the APSCOM Conference Seoul 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Perceptual grouping ==
Since the [[perception]] of objects implies a segregation of some parts of the environment (''figure'') from other parts of the environment (''ground''), a [[perceptual system]] will have to rely on certain features in the environment for the aggregation of what goes together. This aggregation is termed [[Principles of grouping|''perceptual grouping'' (PG)]], and the aim of TIA is the identification of conditions for the occurrence of PG.&lt;ref name="kubovy227"&gt;Kubovy, M./Valkenburg, D. Van: "In defense of the theory of indispensable attributes." ''Cognition'' 87, 2003, pp. 225–233, here: p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt;

PG is considered as a transformation happening between some input and some output. The input &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt; is considered a set of discrete elements which are distributed over some medium &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;. Media are also termed ''indispensable attributes'' (IA). The output PP is termed a ''phenomenal partition'' of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt; into subsets, or ''blocks'', E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., E&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="kubovy227" /&gt;

The grouping into some block E&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; occurs in reference to at least one feature F&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; from a set of features &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;. Kubovy and Van Valkenburg (2003) recommend the following expression for the description of a PP: "... the elements of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt; spread over &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;, are grouped by &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;."&lt;ref name="kubovy227" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9787">'''Wet oxidation''' is a form of hydrothermal treatment.  It is the [[oxidation]] of dissolved or suspended components in [[water]] using [[oxygen]] as the [[oxidizer]].  It is referred to as "Wet Air Oxidation" (WAO) when [[air]] is used.  The oxidation reactions occur in [[superheated water]] at a temperature above the normal boiling point of water (100&amp;nbsp;°C), but below the critical point (374&amp;nbsp;°C).

The system must be maintained under pressure to avoid excessive evaporation of water.  This is done to control energy consumption due to the [[latent heat of vaporization]].  It is also done because liquid water is necessary for most of the oxidation reactions to occur.  Compounds oxidize under wet oxidation conditions that would not oxidize under dry conditions at the same temperature and pressure.

Wet oxidation has been used commercially for around 60 years.  It is used predominantly for treating wastewater.  It is often referred to as '''Zimpro'''  (from ZIMmerman PROcess), after Fred T. Zimmermann who commercialized it in the mid 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.water.siemens.com/en/about_us/legacy_brands/Pages/zimpro.aspx|title=Zimpro History|accessdate=February 2010|df=}}| archiveurl= | archivedate=2013-03-31&lt;/ref&gt;

==System Description==
Commercial systems typically use a [[bubble column reactor]], where air is bubbled through a vertical column that is liquid full of the hot and pressurized wastewater.  Fresh wastewater enters the bottom of the column and oxidized wastewater exits the top.  The heat released during the oxidation is used to maintain the operating temperature.

WAO is a liquid phase reaction using dissolved oxygen in water to oxidize wastewater contaminants.  The dissolved oxygen is typically supplied using pressurized air, but pure oxygen can also be used.  The oxidation reaction generally occurs at moderate temperatures of 150°-320&amp;nbsp;°C and at pressures from 10 to 220 barg.  The process converts organic contaminants to carbon dioxide, water, and biodegradable short chain organic acids.  Inorganic constituents such as sulfides and cyanides are converted to non-reactive inorganic compounds.

In the WAO reaction, complex organic molecules, including biological refractory compounds, are broken into simpler organic compounds or to a complete mineralized state (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;, PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt; Simple organic compounds such as low molecular weight carboxylic acids and mineralized reaction products may be present in the WAO effluents.  Because of this, the WAO effluent generally requires post treatment prior to discharge. WAO effluents are typically readily biodegradable and exhibit high values for [[Biological oxygen demand|BOD]]:[[Chemical oxygen demand|COD]] ratios.  Standard treatment techniques such as activated sludge biotreatment are typically used with WAO for complete treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Kumfer, B.; Lehmann, D. Wet Air Oxidation of Difficult to Treat Pharmaceutical Waste Streams. ''Water Practice'' '''2007,''' ''2''''',''' 1-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Catalysis|Catalyst]] can be used in the WAO system to enhance treatment and achieve a higher COD destruction.  Heterogeneous and homogenous catalysts have been used.  Heterogeneous catalysts are based on precious metals deposited on a stable substrate.  Homogenous catalysts are dissolved transition metals.  Several processes, such as Ciba-Geigy, LOPROX, and ATHOS utilize a homogenous catalyst.&lt;ref&gt;Levec,J.; Albin,P. Catalytic wet-air oxidation processes: A review. ''Catalysis Today''. '''2007''', ''124'', 172-184.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Luck, F. Wet air oxidation: past, present and future. ''Catalysis Today'' '''1999''', ''53'', 81-91.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mixed metal catalysts, such a Ce/Mn, Co/Ce, Ag/Ce,  have also been effective in improving the treatment achieved in a WAO system.&lt;ref&gt;Silva, A.; Marques, R.; Quinta-Ferreira, R. Catalyst based in cerium oxide for wet oxidation of acrylic acid in the prevention of environmental risks. ''Applied Catalysis'' '''2004''', ''47'', 269-279.&lt;/ref&gt;

A special type of wet oxidation process was the so-called "VerTech process" system. A system of this type operated in [[Apeldoorn]], [[Netherlands]] between 1994 and 2004. The system was installed in a below-ground pressure vessel (also called a gravity [[pressure vessel]] or GPV). The pressure was supplied by feeding the material to a reactor with a depth of {{convert|1200|m|ft}}. The deep shaft reactor also served as a heat exchanger, so no pre-heating was required. The operating temperature was about 270&amp;nbsp;°C with a pressure of about {{convert|100|bar|psi}}. The installation was eventually shut down due to operational problems.&lt;ref&gt;Bhargava, S.K.; Tardio, J.; Prasad, J.; Folger, K.; Akolekar, D.B.; Grocott, S.C.

== Commercial Applications ==

=== Spent Caustic Treatment ===
The majority of commercial wet oxidation systems are used to treat industrial wastewater, such as [[sulfide]] laden [[spent caustic]] streams from ethylene and LPG production as well as naphthenic and cresylic spent caustics from refinery applications.

Low temperature WAO systems oxidize sulfides to thiosulfate and sulfate but high concentrations of thiosulfate are present in the treated effluent.  The mid temperature systems fully oxidize sulfides to sulfate and mercaptans are oxidized to sulfonic acids.  For sulfidic spent caustics, this results in a high chemical oxygen demand (COD) destruction (&gt;90%).  High temperature systems are used to oxidize organic compounds that are present in naphthenic and cresylic spent caustics.

=== Sewage Sludge Treatment ===
Almost as many systems are also used for treating [[biosolids]], in order to [[pasteurize]] and to decrease volume of material for disposal.  The thermal conditioning occurs at temperatures of 210 – 240&amp;nbsp;°C.  A 4% dry solid slurry can be processed in a WAO system where it is disinfected and the treated effluent can be dewatered to 55% dry solids using a filter press.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Other Applications ===
Wet air oxidation has also been used to treat a variety of other industrial process waters and wastewaters which include:

'''William Tilden Blodgett''' (1823 – 4 November 1875) was a [[New York City]] art collector who was instrumental in founding the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].

He was active in the [[American Civil War]] and organized the NYC [[Union League Club]] and the [[Sanitary Fair]] to raise funds for the wounded. He founded the newspaper ''[[The Nation]]'' and was a leader in establishing the [[American Museum of Natural History]]. He was a founding member of the committee to form the Met in 1869 and was its first chairman. He had been on the selection committee for the American works to be presented at the French exhibition of 1867 and thus felt he knew enough to purchase pictures for the young museum while abroad in 1870.

He purchased a total of 174 pictures which he financed together with [[John Taylor Johnston]] and about half of this "1871 purchase" is still in the museum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/blogs/now-at-the-met/features/2011/today-in-met-history-march-28 Today in MET History]], museum blog in 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
