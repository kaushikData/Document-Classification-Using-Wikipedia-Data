'''Anthologise''' is a national '''poetry competition''' for [[United Kingdom|British]] secondary schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetrybooks.co.uk/news/146/anthologise_poetry_competition/|title=Poetry Book Society|author=|publisher=Poetrybooks.co.uk|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was established in 2011, and is spearheaded by [[Carol-Ann Duffy]], the [[Poet Laureate]].  The competition is administered by the publishing house [[Picador]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.picador.com/Blogs/2011/9/Message-from-Carol-Ann-Duffy |title=Error - Picador |author=Picador |publisher=Picador.com |accessdate=25 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127102519/http://www.picador.com/Blogs/2011/9/Message-from-Carol-Ann-Duffy |archivedate=27 November 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The competition was launched by HRH the [[Duchess of Cambridge]] in September 2011.

Schoolchildren aged 11 to 18 are invited to create and submit their own anthologies of published poetry to an expert judging panel of poets, academics and critics.  In 2011 the ''Anthologise'' judges were [[Carol-Ann Duffy]]; [[Gillian Clarke]] (National Poet for Wales); [[John Agard]]; [[Grace Nichols]]; and Cambridge Professor of Children’s Poetry, Morag Styles.

The first ever winners of ''Anthologise'' were [[Monkton Combe School]], [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], with their anthology called ''The Poetry of Earth is Never Dead''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://monktoncombeschool.com/news-events/news/monkton-win-anthologise.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130814100520/http://monktoncombeschool.com/news-events/news/monkton-win-anthologise.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 14, 2013 |accessdate=August 14, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Filipino language]], based on the [[Tagalog language]] (the major dialect), is the national language of the Philippines. The [[Christian Bible]] has been translated into numerous Philippine languages.

==Tagalog==
Portions of the Bible were first translated by Spanish friars into the Philippine languages in the catechisms and prayer materials they produced.

The Doctrina Cristiana (1593) was the first book published in Tagalog Baybayin Script.{{fact|date=February 2018}}

Protestants published ''Ang Biblia'' in 1905 in Tagalog, based on the Spanish version of the Protestant canon.{{fact|date=February 2018}}

[[Jose C. Abriol]], Filipino Catholic priest, translated from Hebrew and Greek into Tagalog.&lt;ref name="RCam2"&gt;[http://www.rcam.org/news/2004/joseabriol.htm Msgr. Jose Abriol: A Great Church Intellectual Passes Away] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527032410/http://www.rcam.org/news/2004/joseabriol.htm|date=2011-05-27}}, The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Manila website, RCam.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Protestant denominations use the [[New International Version]] of the Bible, as English is the official language of the [[Philippines]]. However, [[Mainline Protestant]] denominations in the Philippines tend to prefer the ''Magandang Balita Biblia'' (Good News Bible).{{fact|date=February 2018}} The [[Iglesia ni Cristo]] also uses the same translation.{{fact|date=February 2018}}

[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] use their own translation of the Bible, the ''New World Translation'', published in Tagalog, as well as Cebuano and Hiligaynon.

'''Chinese input methods''' are methods that allow a computer user to input [[Chinese characters]]. Most, if not all, Chinese [[input method]]s fall into one of two categories: phonetic readings or root shapes. Methods under the phonetic category usually are easier to learn but are less efficient, thus resulting in slower typing speeds because they typically require users to choose from a list of phonetically similar characters for input; whereas methods under the root shape category allow very precise and speedy input but have a difficult [[learning curve]] because they often require a thorough understanding of a character's strokes and composition.

Other methods allow users to write characters directly onto [[touchscreen]]s, such as those found on mobile phones and tablet computers.

==History==
[[Image:Large chinese keyboard.jpg|thumb|200px|right|An early experimental Chinese keyboard with many keys was developed by researchers of [[National Chiao Tung University]] in Taiwan, but it never became mainstream.]]
Chinese input methods predate the computer. One of the early attempts was an electro-mechanical [[Chinese typewriter]] Ming kwai ({{zh|c=明快 |p=míngkuài |w=ming-k'uai}}) which was invented by [[Lin Yutang]], a prominent Chinese writer, in the 1940s.  It assigned thirty base shapes or strokes to different keys and adopted a new way of categorizing Chinese characters. But the typewriter was not produced commercially and Lin soon found himself deeply in debt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://203.68.20.65/science/content/1972/00110035/0018.htm 中文與計算機] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20030513120935/http://203.68.20.65/science/content/1972/00110035/0018.htm |date=2003-05-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the 1980s, Chinese publishers hired teams of workers and selected a few thousand type pieces from an enormous Chinese character set. Chinese government agencies entered characters using a long, complicated list of [[Chinese telegraph code]]s, which assigned different numbers to each character. During the early computer era, Chinese characters were categorized by their radicals or Pinyin romanization, but results were less than satisfactory.
[[Image:Keyboard layout cangjie.png|thumb|200px|A typical [[keyboard layout]] for the Cangjie method, which is based on [[keyboard layout#United States|United States keyboard layout]]]]
[[Chu Bong-Foo]] invented a common input method in 1976 with his [[Cangjie input method]], which assigns different "roots" to each key on a standard computer keyboard. With this method, for example, the character 日 is assigned to the A key, and 月 is assigned to B. Typing them together will result in the character 明 ("bright").

Despite its steeper learning curve, this method remains popular in Chinese communities that use [[traditional Chinese character]]s, such as [[Hong Kong]] and [[Taiwan]]; the method allows very precise input, thus allowing users to type more efficiently and quickly, provided they are familiar with the fairly complicated rules of the method. It was the first method that allowed users to enter more than a hundred Chinese characters per minute.

All methods have their strengths and weaknesses. The [[pinyin method]] can be learned rapidly but its maximum input rate is limited. The ''[[Wubi method|Wubi]]'' takes longer to learn, but expert typists can enter text much more rapidly with it than with phonetic methods.

Due to these complexities, there is no "standard" method.

In mainland China, the [[Wubi method|wubi]] (shape-based) and pinyin methods such as [[Sogou Pinyin]] and [[Google Pinyin]] are the most popular; in [[Taiwan]], [[Boshiamy method|Boshiamy]], [[Cangjie method|Cangjie]], and [[Bopomofo|zhuyin]] predominate; and in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], the [[Cangjie method|Cangjie]] is most often taught in schools.

Other methods include [[handwriting recognition]], [[Optical character recognition|OCR]] and [[Speech recognition|voice recognition]]. The computer itself must first be "trained" before the first or second of these methods are used; that is, the new user enters the system in a special "learning mode" so that the system can learn to identify their handwriting or speech patterns. The latter two methods are used less frequently than keyboard-based input methods and suffer from relatively high error rates, especially when used without proper "training", though higher error rates are an acceptable trade-off to many users.

== Categories ==

===Phonetic-based===
[[File:Interface of Weasel Input Method.png|thumb|Interface of a [[Pinyin]] input method, showing the need to choose an appropriate word out of a list of options. The word typed is "Wikipedia" in Mandarin Chinese, but the options shown include (from top to bottom) Wikipedia, [[Uncyclopedia]], Wiki, Crisis, and Rules Violation.]]
{{See also|Pinyin input method}}
{{See also|Bopomofo}}
{{See also|Jyutping}}
The user enters pronunciations that are converted into relevant Chinese characters. The user must select the desired character from homophones, which are common in Chinese. Modern systems, such as [[Sogou Pinyin]] and [[Google Pinyin]], predict the desired characters based on context and user preferences. For example, if one enters the sounds ''jicheng'', the software will type 繼承 (to inherit), but if ''jichengche'' is entered,  計程車 (taxi) will appear.

Various Chinese dialects complicate the system. Phonetic methods are mainly based on standard [[pinyin]], [[Zhùyīn fúhào|Zhuyin]]/Bopomofo, and [[Jyutping]] in China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, respectively. Input methods based on other [[varieties of Chinese]], like [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] or [[Southern Min|Minnan]], also exist.

While the phonetic system is easy to learn, choosing appropriate Chinese characters slows typing speed. Most users report a typing speed of fifty characters per minute, though some reach over one hundred per minute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bbs.sogou.com/284579/goYBXy1sJXqFBAAAA.html users' Report on Pinyin Method], Sougou BBS&lt;/ref&gt; With some phonetic IMEs, in addition to predictive input based on previous conversions, it is possible for users to create custom dictionary entries for frequently used characters and phrases, potentially lowering the number of characters required to evoke it.

==== Shuangpin ====
[[File:Microsoft Double Pinyin Scheme.png|thumb|420px|The Microsoft pinyin 2003 shuangpin scheme.]]
Shuangpin (双拼), literally dual spell, is a stenographical phonetic [[input method]] based on [[hanyu pinyin]] that reduces the number of keystrokes for one [[Chinese character]] to two by distributing every vowel and consonant composed of more than one letter to a specific key. In most Shuangpin layout schemes such as Xiaohe, Microsoft 2003 and Ziranma, the most frequently used vowels are placed on the middle layer, reducing the risk of [[Repetitive strain injury]].

Shuangpin is supported by a large number of pinyin input software including QQ, Microsoft Bing Pinyin, [[Sogou Pinyin]] and [[Google Pinyin]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4182">'''Concept mining''' is an activity that results in the extraction of [[concept]]s from [[Document|artifacts]]. Solutions to the task typically involve aspects of [[artificial intelligence]] and [[statistics]], such as [[data mining]] and [[text mining]].&lt;ref&gt;Yuen-Hsien Tseng, Chun-Yen Chang, Shu-Nu Chang Rundgren, and Carl-Johan Rundgren, " [https://www.academia.edu/download/35493513/Mining_concept_maps_from_news_stories_for_measuring_civic_scientific_literacy_in_media.pdf Mining Concept Maps from News Stories for Measuring Civic Scientific Literacy in Media]", Computers and Education, Vol. 55, No. 1, August 2010, pp. 165-177.&lt;/ref&gt; Because artifacts are typically a loosely structured sequence of words and other symbols (rather than concepts), the problem is [[nontrivial]], but it can provide powerful insights into the meaning, provenance and similarity of documents.

==Methods==

Traditionally, the conversion of words to concepts has been performed using a [[thesaurus]],&lt;ref&gt;Yuen-Hsien Tseng, " [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yuen-Hsien_Tseng/publication/229604107_Automatic_thesaurus_generation_for_Chinese_documents_Special_issue/links/54db4bd80cf233119bc5c1c6/Automatic-thesaurus-generation-for-Chinese-documents-Special-issue.pdf Automatic Thesaurus Generation for Chinese Documents]", Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, Vol. 53, No. 13, Nov. 2002, pp. 1130-1138.&lt;/ref&gt; and for computational techniques the tendency is to do the same. The thesauri used are either specially created for the task, or a pre-existing language model, usually related to Princeton's [[WordNet]].

The mappings of words to concepts&lt;ref&gt;Yuen-Hsien Tseng, " [http://ai2-s2-pdfs.s3.amazonaws.com/1e8b/c4c569c551a56c7d56817138aa9285eb6c8b.pdf Generic Title Labeling for Clustered Documents]", Expert Systems With Applications, Vol. 37, No. 3, 15 March 2010, pp. 2247-2254 .&lt;/ref&gt; are often ambiguous. Typically each word in a given language will relate to several possible concepts. Humans use context to disambiguate the various meanings of a given piece of text, where available [[machine translation]] systems cannot easily infer context.

For the purposes of concept mining however, these ambiguities tend to be less important than they are with machine translation, for in large documents the ambiguities tend to even out, much as is the case with text mining.

There are many techniques for [[Word sense disambiguation|disambiguation]] that may be used. Examples are linguistic analysis of the text and the use of word and concept association frequency information that may be inferred from large text corpora. Recently, techniques that base on [[semantic similarity]] between the possible concepts and the context have appeared and gained interest in the scientific community.

==Applications==

===Detecting and indexing similar documents in large corpora===
One of the spin-offs of calculating document statistics in the concept domain, rather than the word domain, is that concepts form natural tree structures based on [[hypernymy]] and [[meronymy]]. These structures can be used to produce simple tree membership statistics, that can be used to locate any document in a [[Euclidean concept space]]. If the size of a document is also considered as another dimension of this space then an extremely efficient indexing system can be created. This technique is currently in commercial use locating similar legal documents in a 2.5 million document corpus.

===Clustering documents by topic===
Standard numeric clustering techniques may be used in "concept space" as described above to locate and index documents by the inferred topic. These are numerically far more efficient than their [[text mining]] cousins, and tend to behave more intuitively, in that they map better to the similarity measures a human would generate.

The '''crocodile paradox''', also known as crocodile sophism, is a [[paradox]] in [[logic]] in the same family of paradoxes as the [[liar paradox]].&lt;ref name="Wolf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CrocodilesDilemma.html|title=Crococile Dilemma – MathWorld|accessdate=2009-09-05|last=Barile|first=Margherita}}&lt;/ref&gt; The premise states that a crocodile, who has stolen a child, promises the father/mother that their child will be returned [[if and only if]] they correctly predict what the crocodile will do next.

The transaction is logically smooth but unpredictable if the parent guesses that the child will be returned, but a dilemma arises for the crocodile if the parent guesses that the child will not be returned. In the case that the crocodile decides to keep the child, he violates his terms: the parent's prediction has been validated, and the child should be returned. However, in the case that the crocodile decides to give back the child, he still violates his terms, even if this decision is based on the previous result: the parent's prediction has been falsified, and the child should not be returned. The question of what the crocodile should do is therefore [[paradox]]ical, and there is no justifiable solution.&lt;ref name="lect"&gt;{{cite book|title=Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1989|isbn=3540530827|page=14|editor=J. Siekmann}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Traveling East|publisher=iUniverse|year=2005|first=Ronald E|last=Young|isbn=0595795846|pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Murray's Compendium of logic|year=1847|first=Richard|last=Murray|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crocodile dilemma serves to expose some of the logical problems presented by [[metaknowledge]]. In this regard, it is similar in construction to the [[unexpected hanging paradox]], which [[Richard Montague]]&amp;nbsp;(1960) used to demonstrate that the following assumptions about knowledge are inconsistent when tested in combination:&lt;ref name="lect" /&gt;
:&lt;blockquote&gt;(i)  If ''ρ'' is known to be true, then ''ρ''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
:&lt;blockquote&gt;(ii) It is known that (i).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
:&lt;blockquote&gt;(iii) If ''ρ'' implies ''σ'', and ''ρ'' is known to be true, then ''σ'' is also known to be true.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Ancient Greek sources were the first to discuss the crocodile dilemma.&lt;ref name="Wolf" /&gt;

''Crown Letters and Punctuation and Their Placements'' ([[Arabic]]: حروف التاج وعلامات الترقيم ومواضع استعمالها—) is a manifesto published by the [[Egyptian Ministry of Education]] and written by Abdulqader Aashour in 1932. It was released after the fabrication of the Crown Script to be a manual of sorts.

== Crown Script ==
The Crown script (Arabic: خط التاج—''Khat al Taj'')—is a modern Arabic script fabricated by Egyptian calligrapher Mohammad Mahfouz in 1931 and proposed by then-King Fuad (also spelt Fouad) the First. The purpose of inventing this script was to implement capital letters into the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] script to be used similarly to [[English language|English]] capital letters—which it does very well.
Capital Crown Letters are different from small letters in a sense that they possess a loop—or an upside-down لا—on top of them; letters that may connect to the next letter also connect to that loop, whereas letters that do not connect to the next letter also don’t connect to that loop.

In 1932, the Egyptian Ministry of Education released a manifesto titled Crown Letters and Punctuation Marks and Their Positions of Use,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scribd.com/doc/207119358/%D8%AD%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%81-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%AC-%D9%88-%D8%B9%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%82%D9%8A%D9%85&lt;/ref&gt; which thoroughly explained the script and was very likely the first book ever written in Crown script. Punctuation was also included because, in fact, there were no set rules for Arabic writing and everyone wrote as they pleased; as such, punctuation was just thrown anywhere into a sentence for aesthetic purposes rather than simplifying sentences to make concepts easier to grasp for the reader. Even now, punctuation is very badly abused—this is most obvious on social networking websites.

The manifesto concluded that [''see below for supplements'']:
# Big letters as shown in supplement one are to be called Crown Letters; taking into account the form in which these letters are enthroned and because they were developed under the will of the Crown.
# Punctuation marks are to be used as shown in supplement two.
# Crown Letters are to be used as shown in supplements three and four.
# The Ministry of Education may use all the wherewithal necessary to popularize the use of the Crown Letters and punctuation marks and all that is required by the implementation of that from integrating them into curricula to the promulgation of their benefits to the crowds to the facilitation of their use in the press.

More accurately, however, the Crown script isn’t really a script of its own; it’s more of an addition to existing scripts. The Ministry of Education’s manifesto specified that Crown Letters may be used with Naskh and Rok’a scripts.

In [[linguistics]] and related fields, an '''emic unit''' is a type of [[abstract object]]. Kinds of emic units are generally denoted by terms with the suffix ''-eme'', such as ''[[phoneme]]'', ''[[grapheme]]'', and ''[[morpheme]]''. The term "emic unit" is defined by Nöth (1995) to mean "an invariant form obtained from the reduction of a class of variant forms to a limited number of abstract units". The variant forms are called '''etic units''' (from ''[[phonetics|phonetic]]''). This means that a given emic unit is considered to be a single underlying object that may have a number of different observable "[[Surface_form|surface]]" representations.  

The various etic units that represent a given emic unit of a certain kind are denoted by a corresponding term with the [[prefix]] ''allo-'',   such as ''[[allophone]]'', ''[[allograph]]'', and ''[[allomorph]]''.

==History and terminology==
The first emic unit to be considered, in the late 19th century, was the phoneme. The word ''phoneme'' comes from the {{lang-el|φώνημα}}, ''phōnēma'', meaning "that which is sounded", from the verb φωνέω, ''phōneō'', "sound", which comes in turn from the noun φωνή, ''phōnē'', "sound". Thus it was originally used (in its French form ''phonème'') to refer simply to a speech sound. But it soon came to be used in its modern sense, to denote an abstract concept (for more details, see [[Phoneme#Background and related ideas|Phoneme: Background and related ideas]]). It is by analogy with ''phoneme'' that other emic units, such as the morpheme and the grapheme, were named using the ''-eme'' suffix. The actual terms "emic unit" and "etic unit" were introduced by [[Kenneth Pike]] (1954).

The prefix ''allo-'' used in terms such as ''allophone'' is from the Ancient Greek ἄλλος meaning "other". The prefix is also used in [[chemistry]].

==Examples in linguistics==
The following are the most commonly analyzed kinds of emic units in linguistics:
*A '''[[phoneme]]''' is an underlying object whose surface representations are [[phone (phonetics)|phone]]s (speech sounds); different phones representing the same phoneme are called ''[[allophone]]s'' of that phoneme. The choice of allophone may be dependent on the phonological context (neighboring sounds), or may be subject to [[free variation]].
*A '''[[morpheme]]''' is an underlying object whose surface representations are meaningful fragments of language; different fragments representing the same morpheme are called ''[[allomorph]]s'' of that morpheme.
*A '''[[grapheme]]''' is an underlying object whose surface representations are [[glyph]]s (written symbols); different glyphs representing the same grapheme are called ''[[allograph]]s'' of that grapheme.

Other examples of emic units in various branches of linguistics include the [[lexeme]], [[grammeme]], [[chereme]], [[sememe]], and [[tagmeme]].

==Generalizations outside linguistics==
In linguistics a distinction is made between so-called "emic" and "etic" accounts. For example a phonemic description is one expressed in terms of phonemes, whereas a phonetic one is based on the phones actually produced. This distinction was generalized by Pike (1954) and is applied in various [[social sciences|social]] and [[behavioral sciences|behavioral]] sciences. In [[emic and etic|this general sense]], an emic account is one that assumes insider knowledge of a phenomenon (as for example the unconscious awareness of a language's phonemic system that is assumed to be possessed by that language's native speakers). By contrast, an etic account is one based on the observations of an outsider.

2001 was declared the '''European Year of Languages''' by the [[Council of Europe]], the [[European Union]], and [[UNESCO]]. In announcing the initiative, the three bodies argued for the importance of language learning for personal development and suggested that lingual competencies are needed to respond to economic, social, and cultural [[social change|changes]] in society. The declaration was accompanied by initiatives in most European countries; it was expected to draw attention to Europe's cultural richness and to support closer collaboration among people, schools, and institutions. One initiative was a Lingual Education Week for Adults, held May 5-11 to emphasize that it is never too late to learn a new language.

'''Georg Herman Monrad-Krohn''' (14 March 1884 – 1 September 1964), born in [[Bergen]], [[Norway]], is known for his work on the development of [[neurology]] early in the 20th century.  He studied at the National Hospital, Queens Square in London, and often visited [[Paris, France]] to work in the [[Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital]] facilities.  In 1917 he returned to Norway, and began studies at the Neurological University Clinic of Oslo (Rikshospitalet), where he was appointed a Professor in 1922.  In 1927 he became Professor of Neurology at the [[University of Oslo]], and later [[Emeritus Professor]] of Neurology..  He retired from this professorial chair at the age of 70.&lt;ref name="wiley1964"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0404.1964.tb04260.x/abstract |title=PROFESSOR G. H. MONRAD-KROHN 80 YEARS|date=2009-01-29 |accessdate=2013-02-07 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0404.1964.tb04260.x |volume=40 |journal=Acta Neurologica Scandinavica |pages=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; His son, the computer engineer and entrepreneur [[Lars Monrad-Krohn]] was born in 1933.  Monrad-Krohn died in 1964 after a long career in what both he and [[Acta Neurologica Scandinavica]] termed "the struggle for neurology".&lt;ref name="wiley1964"/&gt;

==Career==
Monrad-Krohn was interested in various [[language disorders]], in particular [[dysprosody]], and he introduced the term [[aprosody]] to that field.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1841695130 Milestones in the History of Aphasia: Theories and Protagonists p184]&lt;/ref&gt;  He wrote a book entitled 'The Clinical Examination of the Nervous System', of which seven editions were reproduced as texts to be read in the study of the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/44/3/339.extract |title=Notices Of Recent Publications |publisher=Brain.oxfordjournals.org |date=2013-01-01 |accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are now considered antiquarian, and are collectors' items. He was also particularly interested in [[reflexes]].  His 1918 thesis was based on observations of abdominal reflexes.  In 1922 he undertook a major study of facial reflexes in patients with [[leprosy]], and the paralysis displayed by them.  The facial mimicry displayed by them despite their paralysis, termed "paradoxical emotional hypermimia" was given the name "Monrad-Krohn Sign".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archneur.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=565905 |title=Professor G. H. Monrad-Krohn 1884-1964 |publisher=Archneur.jamanetwork.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of his career he received the following awards and appointments:

* [[Michael Skjelderup|Michael Skjelderup Gold Medal]] 1910
* [[Norwegian Neurological Association]], Chairman 1921-1931
* Public Health Association, Chairman 1925-1931
* [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters|The Norwegian Academy of Science]], elected 1929
* Member of the neurological companies in [[France]], [[Denmark]] and [[Estonia]], etc.
* [[Royal College of Surgeons|Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons]] and the [[Royal Society of Medicine|Fellow of the Royal Society of Medicine]] in the UK
* Honorary doctorate at the [[University of Gothenburg]] 1954
* The representative of the Faculty of Medicine at the [[University of Oslo]] since 1945
* Honorary member of the [[Norwegian Neurological Association]], Svenska läkaresällskapet, [[American Academy of Neurology]] and the [[Société de Neuroscience de France]]
* Knight of 1 class of the Norwegian St. Olav 1952, the Danish Dannebrog, the Swedish Nordstjärneorden and officer of the [[French Legion of Honour]]&lt;ref&gt;[[:no:Georg Herman Monrad-Krohn]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monrad-Krohn Prize==
In 1933 he introduced Monrad Krohn's Prize for the Advancement of Neurological Research.  This prize is awarded by the Medical Faculty of the University of Oslo&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmbn.no/news-2007.html |title=Centre for Molecular Biology and Neuroscience - News |publisher=Cmbn.no |date= |accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; annually, to either researchers, or research facilities, deemed to have contributed by means of research to progress in the field of neurology.

:''This article is about the [[grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] of [[verb]]s in the [[Georgian language]] (focused on examples). The reader is advised to see [[Georgian grammar]], especially if not familiar with the language, before attempting to read this article.''

For non-native speakers, Georgian verb conjugation remains a difficult subject even for those who have been studying the language for a while. This is because verbs in Georgian do not tend to conform to a "universal" conjugation system like in most European languages. In verb conjugation, there are some important factors to keep track of:
# Georgian has four classes of verbs: [[transitive verb|transitive]], [[intransitive]], medial and indirect verbs.&lt;ref name="grammar"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hewitt |first=George |date=2005 |title= Georgian - A learner's grammar |edition=2nd|publisher=Routledge |isbn=0415333717 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each class has its own set of rules of conjugation for all [[screeve]]s.&lt;ref name="Makharoblidze"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eprints.iliauni.edu.ge/3038/1/TheGeorgianVerb.pdf |title=The Georgian Verb |last=Makharoblidze |first=Tamar |website=[[Ilia State University]] |access-date=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; What makes it even more difficult is that there are numerous verbs in Georgian that do not seem to conform to the conjugation of one class (see irregular verbs below).
# [[Preverb]]. Although preverbs may have directional meanings, most of the time it is totally arbitrary which verb takes which preverb. In addition, there are many verbs in Georgian that have a common verb stem. Since preverbs are absent in the present [[screeve]]s, these verbs are identical in the present series, and differ in the rest of the series, because different preverbs are prefixed to the verb stem. A learner of the language has no choice but to learn the preverb of each verb.
# Versions. The versioners in Georgian establish the language's [[polypersonalism]]. Although each version vowel has a specific meaning, most of the time, like preverbs, they have arbitrary meanings. Therefore, when learning a new verb, the version vowel the verb employs should also be learnt.
# Thematic suffix. Thematic suffixes are the stems that follow the root of the verb. They are used in the present and future screeves and are mostly (though not always) absent in the aorist and perfective screeves. Like preverbs and versions, thematic suffixes are not only arbitrary, but they also determine the conjugation in the aorist and perfective screeves for transitive (class 1) verbs. There are nine thematic suffixes in Georgian, and almost all the verbs have a specific thematic suffix. Again, when learning a new verb, the thematic suffix has to be learnt together with the other elements.
# In addition, one also has to take into account which suffixal nominal marker is to be used for each verb. This is, however, not arbitrary. The use of appropriate suffixal nominal marker depends on the thematic suffix (as stated above). For each thematic suffix, there are set of rules whether the conjugation is strong or weak for the aorist series and the perfective series of screeves. These set of rules for each thematic suffix have to be mastered.
# Georgian has ''many'' [[irregular verbs]]. It is not possible to give an exact number, because there are different levels of irregularities. Some verbs have different verb roots in different screeves and, thus, are considered irregular. Some other verbs use the same verb root throughout all the screeves, but their conjugations deviate from the normal paradigm of the verb class that they belong to. In addition, some indirect verbs (class 4) are also considered irregular, because they only behave like indirect verbs in the present screeves, and behave like transitive verbs (class 1) in the rest of the screeves.

==Class 1 (transitive verbs)==
* In the present and future sub-series, the subject is in the nominative case and both the direct and indirect objects are in the dative case. The subject is indicated by the ''v''- set marker, while the object is indicated by the ''m''- set marker.&lt;ref name="grammar"/&gt;
* In the aorist series, the subject is in the ergative case while the direct object is in the nominative case. Indirect object is in the dative case. The subject is indicated by the ''v''- set marker, while the object is indicated by the ''m''- set marker.
* In the perfective series, the subject is in the dative case while the direct object is in the nominative case. Indirect object is usually indicated with the post-position -''tvis'' (for). The subject is indicated by the ''m''- set marker, while the object is indicated by the ''v''- set marker.
* In the present sub-series, the preverbs are absent, but the thematic suffixes do exist.
* In the future sub-series, the preverbs emerge, and the thematic suffixes remain.
* In the aorist series, the preverbs emerge, and the thematic suffixes are absent (mostly).
* In the perfective series, the preverbs emerge, and, if the thematic suffix is ''-eb'', its presence depends on whether or not there is a vowel in the root of the verb. If there is a vowel, the thematic suffix remains, otherwise it is lost.

Here is a full conjugation of a verb with all persons in all screeves:

'''Verb root'''

შენ, ''shen''; infinite form აშენება, ''asheneba'' (to build)

'''Present subseries'''

The thematic suffix -ებ, ''-eb'' is present, but without the preverb:

|}

'''Notes'''

¹ The imperfective screeve of class 1 verbs always takes the strong suffixal nominal marker -''i''

² The present subjunctive screeve of class 1 verbs always takes the weak suffixal nominal marker -''e''

³ Class 1 verbs which take the weak suffixal nominal marker in the aorist screeve, take the -''o''- nominal  
marker in the optative screeve, and verbs which take the strong suffixal nominal marker in the aorist 
screeve, take the -''a''- nominal marker in the optative screeve.

† The perfective screeve of class 1 verbs always uses the -''i''- versioner.

‡ The pluperfect and the perfect subjunctive screeves of class 1 verbs always employ the -''e''- versioner.

==Class 2 (intransitive verbs)==
* In class 2 verbs, the subject is in the nominative case for all series, using the ''v''- set marker. Indirect objects (the benefactor or possessive) are indicated with the ''m''- set marker.
* The pattern of preverbs and thematic suffixes is generally the same as with class 1 verbs, except in the perfective series.
* Almost all intransitives utilise the thematic suffix ''-eb'' in formation. Additionally, intransitives may use formational affixes: resulting in a total of three types of formation pattern in intransitives:
# prefixal: ''i-'' appears immediately before the verb root
# suffixal: ''-d'' appears immediately after the verb root
# markerless: no affixes appear

Below is a full conjugation of an intransitive verb:

'''Verb root'''

''bad''; infinite form ''dabadeba'' (to be born)

This verb exhibits the prefixal intransitive pattern; ''i-'' is placed immediately before the verb root in all series apart from the perfective.

'''Present subseries'''

The thematic suffix ''-eb'' is present, without the preverb:

|-
|3pl || ''i-bad-eb-i-an'' || ''i-bad-eb-od-nen'' || ''i-bad-eb-od-nen''
|}

'''Future subseries'''

The preverb ''da-'' emerges:

{| cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" border="1" style="text-align: center" class="wikitable"
!&amp;nbsp;
!Future indicative
!Conditional
!Future subjunctive
|-
|1s || ''da-v-i-bad-eb-i'' || ''da-v-i-bad-eb-od-i'' || ''da-v-i-bad-eb-od-e'' 
|-  
|2s || ''da-i-bad-eb-i'' || ''da-i-bad-eb-od-i'' || ''da-i-bad-eb-od-e''
|-
|3s || ''da-i-bad-eb-a'' || ''da-i-bad-eb-od-a'' || ''da-i-bad-eb-od-e-s''
|-
|1pl || ''da-v-i-bad-eb-i-t'' || ''da-v-i-bad-eb-od-i-t'' || ''da-v-i-bad-eb-od-e-t'' 
|- 
|2pl || ''da-i-bad-eb-i-t'' || ''da-i-bad-eb-od-i-t'' || ''da-i-bad-eb-od-e-t''
|-
|3pl || ''da-i-bad-eb-i-an'' || ''da-i-bad-eb-od-nen'' || ''da-i-bad-eb-od-nen''
|}

'''Aorist series'''

The preverb is present; the thematic suffix is lost:

{| cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" border="1" style="text-align: center" class="wikitable"
!&amp;nbsp;
!Aorist indicative
!Optative
|-
|1s || ''da-v-i-bad-e'' || ''da-v-i-bad-o''
|-  
|2s || ''da-i-bad-e'' || ''da-i-bad-o''
|-

|2pl || ''da-i-bad-e-t'' || ''da-i-bad-o-t''
|-
|3pl || ''da-i-bad-nen'' || ''da-i-bad-o-n''
|}

'''Perfective series'''

Formation comprises the past participle (''da-(v)-bad-eb-ul-i''), followed by a form of the copula:

{| cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" border="1" style="text-align: center" class="wikitable"
!&amp;nbsp;

!Pluperfect
!Perfect subjunctive
|-
|1s || ''da-v-bad-eb-ul-v-a-r'' || ''da-v-bad-eb-ul-i-q'av-i'' || ''da-v-bad-eb-ul-i-q'-o'' 
|-  
|2s || ''da-bad-eb-ul-x-a-r'' || ''da-bad-eb-ul-i-q'av-i'' || ''da-bad-eb-ul-i-q'-o''
|-

|- 
|2pl || ''da-bad-eb-ul-x-a-r-t'' || ''da-bad-eb-ul-i-q'av-i-t'' || ''da-bad-eb-ul-i-q'-o-t''
|-
|3pl || ''da-bad-eb-ul-an'' || ''da-bad-eb-ul-i-q'v-nen'' || ''da-bad-eb-ul-i-q'-o-n''
|}

==Class 3 (medial verbs)==
* These verbs have the same case marking as class 1 verbs (i.e. aorist series - ergative-nominative; present/future series - nominative-dative; perfective series - dative-nominative), the difference being that they describe intransitive activities: verbs expressing movement, sound and weather are found in this category.&lt;ref name="grammar"/&gt;
* Therefore, many class 3 verbs do not take a direct object; however some may (e.g. ''tamashob'' - to play), whilst others take an obligatory direct object (e.g. ''q'idulob'' - to buy).
* Almost all medials form the future/aorist in the same, very regular, way, outlined below.

Full conjugation follows:

'''Verb root'''

''tamash''; infinite form ''tamashob'' (to play)

'''Present subseries'''

The thematic suffix ''-ob'' is present:

{| cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" border="1" style="text-align: center" class="wikitable"
!&amp;nbsp;
!Present indicative
!Imperfect
!Present subjunctive
|-
|1s || ''v-tamash-ob'' || ''v-tamash-ob-d-i'' || ''v-tamash-ob-d-e'' 
|-  
|2s || ''tamash-ob'' || ''tamash-ob-d-i'' || ''tamash-ob-d-e''
|-
|3s || ''tamash-ob-s'' || ''tamash-ob-d-a'' || ''tamash-ob-d-e-s''
|-
|1pl || ''v-tamash-ob-t'' || ''v-tamash-ob-d-i-t'' || ''v-tamash-ob-d-e-t'' 
|- 
|2pl || ''tamash-ob-t'' || ''tamash-ob-d-i-t'' || ''tamash-ob-d-e-t''
|-
|3pl || ''tamash-ob-en'' || ''tamash-ob-d-nen'' || ''tamash-ob-d-nen''
|}

'''Future subseries'''

A type of preverb ''i-'' emerges, in combination with the thematic suffix ''-eb'' which replaces ''-ob'' (or any thematic suffix):

{| cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" border="1" style="text-align: center" class="wikitable"
!&amp;nbsp;
!Future indicative
!Conditional
!Future subjunctive
|-
|1s || ''v-i-tamash-eb'' || ''v-i-tamash-eb-d-i'' || ''v-i-tamash-eb-d-e'' 
|-  
|2s || ''i-tamash-eb'' || ''i-tamash-eb-d-i'' || ''i-tamash-eb-d-e''
|-
|3s || ''i-tamash-eb-s'' || ''i-tamash-eb-d-a'' || ''i-tamash-eb-d-e-s''
|-
|1pl || ''v-i-tamash-eb-t'' || ''v-i-tamash-eb-d-i-t'' || ''v-i-tamash-eb-d-e-t'' 
|- 
|2pl || ''i-tamash-eb-t'' || ''i-tamash-eb-d-i-t'' || ''i-tamash-eb-d-e-t''
|-
|3pl || ''i-tamash-eb-en'' || ''i-tamash-eb-d-nen'' || ''i-tamash-eb-d-nen''
|}

'''Aorist series'''

Based on the future form with prefix, but with the loss of the thematic suffix:

{| cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" border="1" style="text-align: center" class="wikitable"
!&amp;nbsp;
!Aorist indicative
!Optative
|-
|1s || ''v-i-tamash-e'' || ''v-i-tamash-o''
|-  
|2s || ''i-tamash-e'' || ''i-tamash-o''
|-
|3s || ''i-tamash-a'' || ''i-tamash-o-s''
|-
|1pl || ''v-i-tamash-e-t'' || ''v-i-tamash-o-t''
|- 
|2pl || ''i-tamash-e-t'' || ''i-tamash-o-t''
|-
|3pl || ''i-tamash-es'' || ''i-tamash-o-n''
|}

'''Perfect series'''

There is no preverb or thematic suffix; subjects are marked in the same way as in class 1 (i.e. with the ''m-'' set and appropriate formant vowels). The object (if present in context) is assumed to be 3rd person singular. '''N.B''' in this series, for some unknown reason, all screeves allow an optional ''-n-'' directly after the stem.

==Class 4 (indirect or 'inversion' verbs)==
*This class of verb is known as indirect or 'inverted' as it marks the logical subject with the indirect object marker set (''m-'' set) and the direct object with the subject marker set (''v-'' set). Nouns are declined in agreement: the logical subject is in the dative, and object in the nominative (or sometimes genitive, as in ''gogo-s'' (dat.) ''dzaghl-is'' (gen.) ''e-shin-i-a'' - the girl is afraid of the dog).
*Verbs in this class denote feelings, sensations and endurant states of being (see also stative verbs), including verbs such as ''q'av'' - to have (X, animate), ''kv'' - to have (X, inanimate) ''q'var'' - to love and ''nd'' - to want.
*Class 4 verbs also include 'desideratives' (verbs of desiring), created using the circumfix ''e- --- -eb'' (compare ''tsek'v-av-s'' 'he dances' and ''e-tsek'v-eb-a'' 'he feels like dancing').

The verb paradigm follows. For simplicity, the verb form always assumes a 3rd person singular object:

'''Verb root'''

''q'var'' - to love

'''Present subseries'''

The verb takes the 'subjective' versioniser ''i-'' in the 1st and 2nd persons, 'objective' ''u-'' in the 3rd person. Note the ending of the 2nd and 3rd person plural (subject) marker ''-t'' takes precedence over the 3rd person singular (object) marker ''-s'':

|-
|3pl || ''u-q'var-t'' || ''u-q'var-d-a-t'' || ''u-q'var-d-e-t''
|}

'''Future subseries'''

Here the verb forms its screeves by using a pre-radical vowel ''e-'', and the thematic suffix ''-eb'', in a way similar to the class 2 verbs (but without the preverb):

{| cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" border="1" style="text-align: center" class="wikitable"
!&amp;nbsp;
!Future indicative
!Conditional
!Future subjunctive
|-

|-

|-

|-
|3pl || ''e-q'var-eb-a-t'' || ''e-q'var-eb-od-a-t'' || ''e-q'var-eb-od-e-t''
|}

'''Aorist series'''

Since the verb does not have an aorist form, and uses the imperfect instead (as many other class 4 verbs), the aorist forms of ''shegiq'vardeba'' 'you'll fall in love with X' are substituted:

{| cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" border="1" style="text-align: center" class="wikitable"
!&amp;nbsp;
!Aorist indicative
!Optative
|-
|1s || ''she-m-i-q'var-d-a'' || ''she-m-i-q'var-d-e-s''
|-

|-
|3s || ''she-u-q'var-d-a'' || ''she-u-q'var-d-e-s''
|-
|1pl || ''she-gv-i-q'var-d-a'' || ''she-gv-i-q'var-d-e-s''
|-

|-
|3pl || ''she-u-q'var-d-a-t'' || ''she-u-q'var-d-e-t''
|}

'''Perfect series'''

This series is not especially consistent: the perfect screeve uses versionisers before the root, whereas the pluperfect and perfect subjunctive screeves take no versioniser. The series forms using the suffix ''-eb'', with ''-od'' as a further suffix in the pluperfect and perfect subjunctive screeves.

{| cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" border="1" style="text-align: center" class="wikitable"
!&amp;nbsp;
!Perfect

|}

'''N.B.''' It is important to bear in mind that each verb form given in the tables has a further five forms corresponding to the 1st and 2nd person singular direct objects, and the 1st, 2nd and 3rd person plural direct objects, giving a theoretical total of 396 bi-personal forms! In practice however these forms are not always distinct (for example the plurality of the 3rd person is not always present in the form). For further discussion, see 'Direct and indirect objects'.

==Direct and indirect objects==
* The verb -''ts'er''-, "to write," (transitive verb)
** Simplest, we have: ''v-ts'er'', ("I am writing") and ''ts'er-s'', ("he/she is writing).
** Adding the -''u''- versioner, we have ''v-'''u'''-ts'er'', ("I am writing to him/her"). Another way to think of this is as follows. In the sentence "I am writing to him/her," him/her is the indirect object. Since, for the verb "write," indirect objects are indicated with the ''m''- set, one has to use the prefix ''u''- to indicate the third person indirect object.
** In order to say "I am writing to you (singular)", we have to remember that ''you'' is the indirect object in this sentence. As stated in the verbal system, verbs which employ the ''v''- set marker to indicate the subject, use the ''m''- set marker to indicate the direct or the indirect object. Looking at the table of the ''m''- set marker, we see that the prefixal nominal marker for the second person singular is '''''g'''''-. Therefore,  "I am writing to you (singular) in Georgian is '''''g'''-ts'er''. If we want to say, "I am writing to you (plural)", then we have '''''g'''-ts'er-'''t'''''.
** Note, however, that some ambiguities arise, as the verb encapsulates the indirect object. While '''''g'''-ts'er-'''t''''' means "I am writing to you (plural)," it could also mean "he/she is writing to you (plural). This is because the plural indirect object "you (plural)" requires both the prefixal nominal marker ''g''- and the plural marker -''t''. The rule in Georgian is that, if a consonant plural marker (-''t'') is to be attached to the verb complex, another suffixal consonant nominal marker has to be dropped. For example, one cannot say ''g-ts'er-'''s'''-'''t''''' ("he/she is writing to you (plural)") in Georgian. Therefore, the verb, in cases like this, fails to indicate whether the performer of the action is the first person or the third person. One, then, has to consider the role of the verb in the entire sentence to understand the exact meaning of the verb.
* The verb -''nd''-, "to want," belongs to indirect verb class (class 4).
** Simplest, we have ''m-i-nd-a'', "I want," and ''u-nd-a'', "he/she wants."
** When we want to construct, "he wants me," '''''me''''' is the direct object. Since the verb "want" requires the ''m''- set marker for the subject, it requires the ''v''- set for the object (this is exactly the opposite in verb "write"). To do this, we need to put both the letter ''v''- at the beginning of the verb and we need to add the auxiliary verb -''var'' to the end (as auxiliary verbs are needed in the present and perfective screeves of indirect verbs when the direct object is the first or the second person). Therefore, we have '''''v'''-u-nd-i-'''var'''''. The letter -''u''- right after the letter ''v''- establishes the meaning that it is the third person who wants. To say, "you want me," we, then, have ''g-'''i'''-nd-i-var''. Here, the -'''''i'''''- means that it is the second person who wants.
** Note that "he/she wants me" and "they want me" are both the same in Georgian: ''v-u-nd-i-var''. If one says, ''v-u-nd-i-var-'''t''''', this rather means "he/she wants '''us'''." This is because the plurality of the subject is not reflected in the verbs that use the ''m''- set marker when the direct object is either the first or the second person.
** The Georgian language has perhaps one of the most complicated plural subject-verb and object-verb agreement systems. Even native speakers do not seem to have a consensus on the reflection of plurality to the verb. One general rule is that in the verbs that employ the ''v''- set nominal marker, the priority of the indicating the plurality of the subject is higher than that of the object. In the verbs that use the ''m''- set nominal marker, this is reversed (just like everything else is reversed). That is why in the example of ''v-u-nd-i-var-'''t''''' the plural marker -'''''t''''' at the end refers to the plurality of the object rather than the plurality of the subject.

==Preverbs==
Preverbs in Georgian can either add directionality to a verb, or can change the meaning of the verb entirely. It is also important to use the appropriate versioner in each case.

Since preverbs are absent in the present series, it is important to consider the role of the verb in the context of the entire sentence as the verb by itself could convey any meaning in the present screeves.

* the verb root -''gh''-:
**Preverb ''a''-:  '''''a'''-gh-eb-a'', to raise, lift up (preverb '''''a'''''- generally implies an upward motion). (Used with versioner -''i'')
**Preverb ''amo''-: '''''amo'''-gh-eb-a'', to take out. (Used with versioner -''i'')
**Preverb ''ga''-: '''''ga'''-gh-eb-a'', to open. (Used with versioner -''a'')

**Preverb ''ts'amo''-: '''''ts'amo'''-gh-eb-a'', to carry. (Used with versioner -''u'')
* the verb root -''q'r''-:
**Preverb ''a''-: '''''a'''-q'r-a'', put forth, throw upward. (Used with versioner -''i'')
**Preverb ''ga''-: '''''ga'''-q'r-a'', stick, put something through. (Used with versioner -''u'')
**Preverb ''gada''-: '''''gada'''-q'r-a'', throw down (preverb '''''gada'''''- generally implies a downward motion). (Used with no versioner, but when used in the meaning "throw down ''to someone''", the -''u'' versioner is used)
**Preverb ''gadmo''-: '''''gadmo'''-q'r-a'', cast something down. (Used with versioner -''a'')
**Preverb ''da''-: '''''da'''-q'r-a'', scatter, drop, let fall. (Used with no versioner)
**Preverb ''mo''-: '''''mo'''-q'r-a'', ask many questions to someone. (Used with versioner -''a'')
**Preverb ''she''-: '''''she'''-q'r-a'', gather together. (Used with no versioner)
**Preverb ''cha''-: '''''cha'''-q'r-a'', pour something (onto someone's head). (Used with versioner -''a'')
* the verb root -''tser''-:
**Preverb ''da''-:  '''''da'''-ts'er-a'', to write
**Preverb ''a(gh)''-:  '''''agh'''-ts'er-a'', to describe, description, census
**Preverb ''amo''-: '''''a-mo'''-ts'er-a'', to write out, extract, to sign off, to deregister

**Preverb ''gada''-: '''''gada'''-ts'er-a'', copying text (or files) from one place to another
**Preverb ''gad-mo''-: '''''gad-mo'''-ts'er-a'', copying/writing out the text from the source, downloading of files
**Preverb ''ga''-: '''''ga'''-ts'er-a'', to plan, to stipulate
**Preverb ''ga-mo''-: '''''ga-mo'''-ts'er-a'', to subscribe (newspaper etc.), to order/buy some item

'''Italian Sign Language''' or '''LIS''' (''Lingua dei Segni Italiana'') is the [[sign language|visual language]] used by [[deaf]] people in [[Italy]]. Deep analysis of it began in the 1980s, along the lines of [[William Stokoe]]'s research on [[American Sign Language]] in the 1960s. Until the beginning of the 21st century, most studies of Italian Sign Language dealt with its phonology and vocabulary. According to the European Union for the Deaf, the majority of the 60,000–90,000 Deaf people in Italy use LIS.

==Structure==
Like many sign languages, LIS is in some ways different from its "spoken neighbour"; thus, it has little in common with spoken [[Italian language|Italian]], but shares some features with non-[[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] oral languages (e.g. it is verb final, like the [[Basque language]]; it has inclusive and exclusive pronominal forms like oceanic languages; interrogative particles are verb final (''You go  where?'').

A sign variety of spoken Italian also exists, the so-called [[Manually Coded Language|Signed Italian]] which combines LIS lexicon with the grammar of spoken Italian: this is not Italian Sign Language, however.

Some features of LIS are typical of sign languages in general, e.g. agreement between nouns, adjectives and verbs is not based on gender (masculine, feminine, neuter) but it is based on place, that is the spatial position in which the sign is performed: nouns can be placed everywhere in the space but their position must be consistent with that of pronouns and verbs. The LIS translation of the sentence "The child speaks to the mother" appears as ''Child-here mother-there this-speak-that'', rather than involving forms like "he, she". The voice intonation is replaced by facial expressions which mark interrogative sentences, imperatives and relative clauses. Other features of Italian Sign Language which can be found also in oral languages are: classifiers; dual, trial, quattrial and even quinquial forms in addition to the general plural; verbs inflected for person.

In geometry, '''Kalai's 3&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt; conjecture''' is a [[conjecture]] on the [[polyhedral combinatorics]] of [[point symmetry|centrally symmetric]] [[polytopes]], made by [[Gil Kalai]] in 1989.&lt;ref name="kalai"&gt;{{citation

==Examples==
[[File:Dual Cube-Octahedron.svg|thumb|The cube and the octahedron, two examples for which the bound of the conjecture is tight]]
In two dimensions, the simplest centrally symmetric [[convex polygon]]s are the [[parallelogram]]s, which have four vertices, four edges, and one polygon; {{nowrap|1=4 + 4 + 1 = 9 = 3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. A [[cube]] is centrally symmetric, and has 8 vertices, 12 edges, 6 square sides, and 1 solid; {{nowrap|1=8 + 12 + 6 + 1 = 27 = 3&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Another three-dimensional [[convex polyhedron]], the [[regular octahedron]], is also centrally symmetric, and has 6 vertices, 12 edges, 8 triangular sides, and 1 solid; {{nowrap|1=6 + 12 + 8 + 1 = 27 = 3&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

In higher dimensions, the [[hypercube]] [0,1]&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt; has exactly 3&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt; faces, each of which can be determined by specifying, for each of the ''d'' coordinate axes, whether the face projects onto that axis onto the point 0, the point 1, or the interval [0,1]. More generally, every [[Hanner polytope]] has exactly 3&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt; faces. If Kalai's conjecture is true, these polytopes would be among the centrally symmetric polytopes with the fewest possible faces.&lt;ref name="kalai"/&gt;

==Generalizations==
In the same work as the one in which the 3&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt; conjecture appears, Kalai conjectured more strongly that the [[Polyhedral combinatorics|''f''-vector]] of every convex centrally symmetric polytope ''P'' dominates the ''f''-vector of at least one Hanner polytope ''H'' of the same dimension. This means that, for every number ''i'' from 0 to the dimension of ''P'', the number of ''i''-dimensional faces of ''P'' is greater than or equal to the number of ''i''-dimensional faces of ''H''. If it were true, this would imply the truth of the 3&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt; conjecture; however, the stronger conjecture was later disproven.&lt;ref name="swz09"&gt;{{citation

==Status==
The conjecture is known to be true for ''d''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;4.&lt;ref name="swz09"/&gt; It is also known to be true for [[simplicial polytope]]s: it follows in this case from a conjecture of {{harvtxt|Bárány|Lovász|1982}} that every centrally symmetric simplicial polytope has at least as many faces of each dimension as the cross polytope, proven by {{harvtxt|Stanley|1987}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

'''Lamy''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɑː|m|i|,_|ˈ|l|æ|m|i|}} is a producer of [[writing instrument]]s in [[Europe]]. The company is German-owned. Josef Lamy, who was a sales representative for [[The Parker Pen Company]] in [[Germany]], founded the business in 1930 by purchasing the Orthos pen manufacturer. Lamy was a pioneer in the use of moulded synthetic plastics to make their product. Lamy was run by Josef Lamy's son, Manfred Lamy, until his retirement in 2006. He was succeeded by Bernhard M. Rösner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finanznachrichten.de/nachrichten-2006-12/7467073-bernhard-m-roesner-uebernimmt-lamy-geschaeftsfuehrung-007.htm|title=Bernhard M. Rösner übernimmt Lamy Geschäftsführung|author=|date=|work=finanznachrichten.de|accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business history==
[[File:Heidelberg Lamy 20101004.jpg|thumb|The Lamy Development Centre in Heidelberg, Germany]]

In 1984, newspapers reported that Lamy's export share increased to 33 percent of turnover. In 1986, Lamy, [[Montblanc (company)|Montblanc]], and Parker held among them 70–80 percent of the West German market. Export markets then consisted of the [[United States of America|US]], [[Japan]], and [[Austria]]. Lamy hoped to expand that export share to 50 percent of turnover, which stood at approximately 40 million [[German mark|Deutschmark]] (DM) for 1985.&lt;ref&gt;''C Lamy of West Germany, which manufactures ball-point and fountain pens, has reported a turnover for 1985 of DM 44m (DM 40m).'', Textline Multiple Source Collection (1980–1994), 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Turnover for Lamy increased to 48 million DM for 1987,&lt;ref&gt;"Results for 1987 for Josef Lamy GmbH.," ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]],'' 23 May 1988&lt;/ref&gt; then employing 350 people, increasing to 54 million DM in 1988 and a corresponding increase in staff to nearly 400.

In 1989, turnover increased to approximately 62 million DM. Lamy had begun taking on employees as [[sleeping partner]]s. Approximately one third of the then 400-person workforce became sleeping partners. In that year, Lamy established contacts with East Germany and planned to do business there as well as in West Germany.&lt;ref&gt;''C. Joseph Lamy GMBH announces 15% increase in turnover in 1989 and plans further investment'', Textline Multiple Source Collection (1980–1994), 18 April 1990&lt;/ref&gt; 1991 held an increase in staff and turnover again, this time to 85 million DM and five hundred staff.&lt;ref&gt;''C Josef Lamy raised 1991 turnover by 15%.'', [[Süddeutsche Zeitung]], 19 May 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Lamy invested in their "innovation workshop" in Heidelberg, in 1996, along with approximate expected turnover being 113 million DM.&lt;ref&gt;''Lamy invests in innovation centre, turnover growth forecast'', Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 24 October 1996&lt;/ref&gt; 1999 showed Lamy reporting stable turnover of approximately 120 million DM, though domestic demand has fallen.&lt;ref&gt;''Lamy records international growth'', Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 16 June 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Product range==
Each Lamy product has a name that evokes an idea related to it; "Scribble", for example, is their mechanical pencil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lamy.de/en/endverbraucher/produkte/schreibsysteme/druckbleistifte?writesystem=2&amp;program=0&amp;targetgroup=1&amp;language=2&amp;prodgroup=1&amp;highprice=0&amp;lowprice=0&amp;newest=0&amp;ref=self&amp;produktid=234&amp;detailmode=detail 185 (3,15) LAMY scribble]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company refers to their products by prefixing "Lamy" in front of the descriptive name, such as "Lamy Scribble" (to avoid repetition, here only the descriptive name is used).

===Fountain pens===
[[File:Lamy nibs + Lamy Nexx.jpg|thumb|Lamy Z 50 nibs in front of a Lamy Nexx fountain pen]]

Many Lamy [[fountain pen]] models share the same type of feed and [[Fountain pen#Nibs|nib]]. Most use [[Iron|Fe]]-[[Nickel|Ni]]-[[Chromium|Cr]] [[stainless steel]] alloy Z 50 nibs which can be interchanged by the user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://peninkcillin.blogspot.de/2011/10/lamy-nibs-comparison-ef-vs-11mm-15mm.html|title=Lamy nibs comparison: EF vs 1.1mm, 1.5mm, 1.9mm italics|author=|date=|work=peninkcillin.blogspot.de|accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The feeds are made of [[ABS plastic]] and after injection molding are chemically etched with [[polyethylene glycol]] (PEG). The etching process causes micro surface scratches by removing styrene from the feed surface and ink channels. This roughening optimizes ink flow characteristics over the feed surface.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fountainpendesign.wordpress.com/feed-supply-ink-function-foutain-pen/feeds-made-of-plastic/ Feeds made of Plastic …and not hard rubber]&lt;/ref&gt;
The 2000 fountain pen model uses nibs of another type which is incompatible with Lamy's other fountain pen models.

====abc====
Lamy's abc beginner's fountain pen was designed by [[Bernt Speigel]] to be used by children while learning to write.  The body is made from maple wood and includes a name sticker in the cap to assist in identifying each student's pen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.lamy.com/eng/b2c/abc/010
| title = Lamy – LAMY abc
| accessdate = 2010-03-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The pen features a non round grip section optimized to be held with a 'tripod pen grip'.

====Safari====
[[File:Lamy Vista, Lamy Safari and Lamy AL-star.jpg|thumb|From top to bottom: Lamy Vista, Lamy Safari, and Lamy AL-star graphite]]
The Safari is a noted design by [[Wolfgang Fabian]]&lt;ref name=designers&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.lamy.com/content/the_company/design/product_designers/index_eng.html
| title = Lamy – Product Designers

{{cite web
| url = http://www.lamy.com/eng/b2c/safari/018

and Bernt Spiegel of the Entwicklungsgruppe Mannheim&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |df          = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
which remains in production from 1980. The Safari and the derived AL-star and Vista lines are all cartridge/converter filled and are intended for students/young writers. Like the "abc" they all feature a non-rounded grip section optimized to be held with a 'tripod pen grip'.

====2000====
[[File:Lamy 2000 fountain pen-3.jpg|thumb|The Lamy 2000.]]
Lamy's flagship fountain pen is the 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lamy.com/the_company/product_innovation/design/history/1966_lamy_2000/index_eng.html |title=LAMY 2000 – More than 30 years of classic modernity |accessdate=2009-02-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011065926/http://www.lamy.com/the_company/product_innovation/design/history/1966_lamy_2000/index_eng.html |archivedate=October 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Designed by [[Gerd Alfred Müller]]&lt;ref name=designers /&gt; and released in 1966, it remains in production today. The 2000 was innovative in its day for its use of a special [[polycarbonate]] resin produced by [[Bayer]], [[Makrolon]], for the body of the pen. It is the only contemporary Lamy fountain pen that has a semi hooded nib and is a piston fill pen offering 1.35 ml ink capacity, so thus only takes bottled ink.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lamy.com/eng/b2c/2000/001 | title = 001 LAMY 2000 | accessdate = 24 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to normal production [[mechanical pencil]], [[ballpoint]] and four-color ballpoint versions, a commemorative fountain pen version was produced for the new [[millennium]] called the ''Edition 2000'', which features an inverse design of the original: a stainless steel body with Makrolon ring and polished clip.&lt;ref name=penspotters&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rickconner.net/penspotters/lamy.2000.html | title = Lamy 2000 at Penspotters | author = Rick Conner | year = 2005 | accessdate = 24 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ballpoints===
The pico is a pocket telescoping ballpoint pen designed by Franco Clivio.&lt;ref name=designers /&gt; It comes in chrome, red, blue, and black finishes. Like some other Lamy pens, the pico features a small protrusion to stop the pen from rolling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lamy.de/en/endverbraucher/produkte/schreibsysteme/kugelschreiber?writesystem=3&amp;program=0&amp;targetgroup=1&amp;language=2&amp;prodgroup=1&amp;highprice=0&amp;lowprice=0&amp;newest=0&amp;ref=self&amp;produktid=91&amp;detailmode=detail 287 LAMY pico pearlchrom]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, date accessed 24 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Lamy also produces a leather carrying case uniquely for this pen. The pen has also won a [[red dot award]] for product design&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.red-dot.org/312+M56bda818b26.html Lamy pico ballpoint pen – red dot online], accessed 4 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rollerballs===
Other designs such as the Safari and Studio come in rollerball form too, though certain designs such as the Swift are uniquely rollerball pens. The distinguishing design feature of the Swift is the retractable clip. When the point is extended, the Swift's clip retracts to be flush with the body of the pen, which helps the pen sit in the hand more comfortably, and also serves as a preventative reminder not to reinsert the pen into one's pocket with the point extended, which may cause staining.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lamy.de/en/endverbraucher/produkte/schreibsysteme/tintenroller?writesystem=5&amp;program=0&amp;targetgroup=1&amp;language=2&amp;prodgroup=1&amp;highprice=0&amp;lowprice=0&amp;newest=0&amp;ref=self&amp;produktid=107&amp;detailmode=detail 330 LAMY swift Palladium] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223023048/http://www.lamy.de/en/endverbraucher/produkte/schreibsysteme/tintenroller?writesystem=5&amp;program=0&amp;targetgroup=1&amp;language=2&amp;prodgroup=1&amp;highprice=0&amp;lowprice=0&amp;newest=0&amp;ref=self&amp;produktid=107&amp;detailmode=detail |date=2007-02-23 }}, date accessed 24 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lamy pens"&gt;[http://www.rickconner.net/penspotters/lamy.html Lamy pens], Rick Conner, 2005, date accessed 24 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multisystem pens===
Lamy produces multisystem pens, which combine a ballpoint and another feature within the one pen, such as the Pickup, which integrates a ballpoint and a highlighter into one body. The highlighter is released from the body of the pen by depressing a button on the body of the pen, and can be reinserted into the body of the pen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lamy.de/en/endverbraucher/produkte/schreibsysteme/mehrsystemschreiber?writesystem=6&amp;program=0&amp;targetgroup=1&amp;language=2&amp;prodgroup=1&amp;highprice=0&amp;lowprice=0&amp;newest=0&amp;ref=self&amp;produktid=133&amp;detailmode=detail 629 LAMY pickup]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, date accessed 24 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The Pickup was also designed by Wolfgang Fabian, and has won the red dot award for product design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.red-dot.org/312+M5cc8b0eabd8.html Lamy pickup – red dot online], date accessed May 4, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mechanical pencils===
Lamy produces mechanical pencils. Some of the other Lamy designs exist in mechanical pencil form, such as the 2000 and the Safari.  The Scribble, also designed by Hannes Wettstein,&lt;ref name=designers /&gt; is a large-bodied pencil with triangular shapings on the body to help the grip.

===Ink===
[[File:Lamy Z 10 ink cartridge + Z 27 converter + Z 28 converter.jpg|thumb|Top to bottom: blue Lamy T 10 proprietary ink cartridge and Z 27 and Z 28 ink converters]]

Lamy produces [[fountain pen ink]] in bottles and proprietary ink cartridges. Lamy provide the widest range of colours in what it designates as T 10 cartridges, with black, blue, blue-black, red, green, turquoise and violet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lamy.de/en/endverbraucher/produkte/zubehoer/minenundzubehoer?writesystem=0&amp;program=0&amp;targetgroup=1&amp;language=2&amp;prodgroup=3&amp;highprice=0&amp;lowprice=0&amp;newest=0&amp;ref=self&amp;produktid=325&amp;detailmode=detail LAMY T10]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, date accessed 24 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The T 10 cartridge has approximately 1.15 ml ink capacity

For using bottled fountain pen ink Lamy offers several proprietary piston operated converters.
The ABC, AL-star, Joy, Nexx, Nexx M, Safari and Vista fountain pens can be fitted with the proprietary Z 24 or Z 28 converter that has approximately 0.7 ml ink capacity. The converters for the school/young writing line of fountain pens feature two protrusions that form fit into two arresting recesses in the grip sections of these pens.
The Accent, Aion, CP 1, Dialog 3, Imporium, Linea, Logo, ST and Studio fountain pens can be fitted with the proprietary Z 27 converter for the premium line of fountain pens that has approximately 0.7 ml ink capacity.

===Ink Erasers===
Lamy also makes double-ended pens that allow one to edit what they have written in ink before. One end is a white nib with a fluid that makes ink 'disappear', the other end has a nib that writes in blue ink which is not affected by the ink eraser so that one can write on top of what was just erased. However, after this is done, one can not rub it out again.

===Earlier designs===
Earlier Lamy designs includes the Lady and the Persona; "vintage" designs are varied but have numerical suffixes instead of descriptive names. The Lady was a design intended to appeal to women; the Lady is manufactured out of painted, hardened, porcelain and does not feature a clip as it was thought that women do not normally make use of the clip—a small protrusion prevents the pen from rolling on a flat surface. The Lady was designed by Wolfgang Fabian and [[Sharon Jodjaja]] was responsible for the barrel designs.&lt;ref name="Lamy pens"/&gt;

==History==

Luminoso was co-founded in 2010 by Dennis Clark, Jason Alonso, Rob Speer, and [[Catherine Havasi]],&lt;ref name="Venture"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kokalitcheva|first1=Kia|title=Luminoso gets $6.5M to turn unstructured text into actionable data|url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/07/02/picking-up-on-your-customers-jargon-is-hard-but-luminoso-is-getting-6-5m-to-do-it/|accessdate=3 March 2015|publisher=Venture Beat|date=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a research scientist at [[MIT]] in [[artificial intelligence]] and [[computational linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harris|first1=David|title=40 Under 40: Catherine Havasi of Luminoso|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/news/2014/10/16/40-under-40-catherine-havasi-of-luminoso.html|accessdate=3 March 2015|publisher=Boston Business Journal|date=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company builds on the knowledge base of MIT’s [[Open Mind Common Sense|Open Mind Common Sense (OMCS)]] project,&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TechCrunch"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Miller|first1=Ron|title=Luminoso Lands $6.5M In Series A To Keep Building Cloud Text Analytics Service|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/02/luminoso-lands-6-5m-in-venture-capital-to-keep-building-cloud-text-analytics-service/|accessdate=3 March 2015|publisher=TechCrunch|date=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GigaOm" /&gt; co-founded in 1999 by Havasi, who continues to serve as its director.&lt;ref name="Havasi"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Havasi|first1=Catherine|title=Who’s Doing Common-Sense Reasoning And Why It Matters|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/09/guide-to-common-sense-reasoning-whos-doing-it-and-why-it-matters/|accessdate=3 March 2015|publisher=TechCrunch|date=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OCMS knowledge base has since been combined with knowledge from other crowdsourced resources, games with a purpose, and expert-created resources to become ConceptNet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.conceptnet.io/|title=ConceptNet|website=www.conceptnet.io|language=en|access-date=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; ConceptNet consists of approximately 28 million statements in 304 languages, with full support for 10 languages and moderate support for 77 languages.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Citation|title=conceptnet5: Code for building ConceptNet from raw data|date=2017-07-15|url=https://github.com/commonsense/conceptnet5|publisher=commonsense|accessdate=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; ConceptNet is a resource for making an AI that understands the meanings of the words people use.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Applications==
[[File:Screenshot of Luminoso Analytics project containing Japanese-language product reviews.png|thumb|270x270px|A Concept Cloud visualization of the most relevant concepts in a Japanese-language dataset]]
The company uses [[artificial intelligence]], [[natural language processing]], and [[machine learning]] to derive insights from [[unstructured data]] such as contact center interactions, chatbot and live chat transcripts, product reviews, open-ended survey responses, and email.&lt;ref name="Wired" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://luminoso.com/who-uses-us|title=Who Uses Us|website=luminoso.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luminoso's software identifies and quantifies patterns and relationships in text-based data, including domain-specific or creative language.&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TechCrunch" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Noyes|first1=Katherine|title=Luminoso to enterprises: Here's what all that chatter really means|url=http://www.networkworld.com/article/2883414/luminoso-to-enterprises-heres-what-all-that-chatter-really-means.html|accessdate=3 March 2015|publisher=Networked World|date=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than human-powered keyword searches of data, the software automates taxonomy creation around concepts, allowing related words and phrases to be dynamically generated and tracked.&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TechCrunch" /&gt; 

Commercial applications include analyzing, prioritizing, and routing contact center interactions; identifying consumer complaints before they begin to trend; and tracking sentiment during product launches.&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wired" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://luminoso.com/products/analytics|title=Analytics|website=luminoso.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The software natively analyzes text in thirteen languages, as well as emoji.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://luminoso.com/get-to-know-us/about|title=About|website=luminoso.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Luminoso's technology can be accessed via two products: Luminoso Analytics and Luminoso Compass.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://luminoso.com/products/compass|title=Compass|website=luminoso.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luminoso Analytics enables a deep-dive analysis into [[Batch processing|batch]] or [[real-time data]], whereas Luminoso Compass automates the categorization of real-time data.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Both products offer a user interface as well as an API.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Luminoso's products can be implemented through either a [[Cloud computing|cloud-based]] or an [[On-premises software|on-premises]] solution.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Research ==
Luminoso continues to actively conduct research in [[natural language processing]] and [[Word embedding|word embeddings]] and regularly participates in evaluations such as [[SemEval]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI17/paper/view/14972|title=Speer|website=aaai.org|access-date=2017-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Camacho-Collados|first=Jose|date=August 3–4, 2017|title=SemEval-2017 Task 2: Multilingual and Cross-lingual Semantic Word Similarity|url=http://wwwusers.di.uniroma1.it/~collados/papers/Semeval17_task2_description.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the 11th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluations (SemEval-2017)|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At SemEval 2017, Luminoso participated in Task 2, measuring the semantic similarity of word pairs within and across five languages.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Its solution outperformed all competing systems in every language pair tested, with the exception of [[Persian language|Persian]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''Mabuhay''' is a [[Filipino language|Filipino]] greeting, usually expressed as ''Mabuhay!'', in the imperative form of ''life'', thus, ''Live!'', from the root word ''buhay'' ([[life]]).

==Meaning==
The phrase carries various meanings including "long live", "may you live", "cheers", "welcome", and "[[hurrah]]". It is thus analogous to [[Aloha]], [[Talofa]] and [[Kia Ora]] in fellow [[Austronesian languages]], [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]], [[Samoan language|Samoan]] and [[Maori language|Māori]]; the [[Romance languages|Romance language]] expression “[[Vive, Viva]]”, the [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] suffix ''[[Zindabad (disambiguation)|Zindabad]]'', and the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] exclamation ''[[Ten thousand years#Modern use 2|Banzai]]''.

==Usage==
The expression is mostly used for toasts during gatherings and parties, and is used as a cry of adulation towards individuals or concepts at rallies and political conferences.  A more modern appropriation of the greeting is its use in the [[Tourism in the Philippines|local hospitality industry]] to welcome guests—a practice rooted in a 1993 campaign launched by restaurateur Rod Ongpauco to more uniquely welcome foreign visitors to the Philippines.&lt;ref name="mabuhay"&gt;{{cite news | author=Luna, Luis | title=Welcome Rotonda to have new name  | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1370&amp;dat=19950513&amp;id=6pkVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=DAsEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1881,2235577 | work=[[Manila Standard Today|Manila Standard]] | publisher=Kamahalan Publishing Corporation | date=May 13, 1995 | accessdate=January 9, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples===
* "''Mabuhay ang Pilipinas! Mabuhay ang Repúblika!''"&lt;br&gt;("Long live the Philippines! Long live the Republic!")
* "''Mabuhay ang [[President of the Philippines|Pangulo]]!''"&lt;br&gt;("Long live the president!")
* "''Mabuhay ang bagong [[Marriage and wedding customs in the Philippines|kasál]]!''"&lt;br&gt;("Long live/cheers for the newlyweds!")

===Viva===
Alternatively, the [[Spanish language in the Philippines|Spanish]] equivalent ''Viva'' is used in almost exclusively [[Religion in the Philippines|religious]] contexts, specifically in shouts of praise directed at a [[patron saint]] or to [[God in Christianity|God]] during fiestas and assemblies (e.g., "''¡Viva [[Santo Niño de Cebú|Señor Santo Niño]]!''")

The '''Macondo Writers Workshop''' is an association of socially-engaged master's level writers working to advance creativity, foster generosity, and serve community. Founded in 1995 by writer [[Sandra Cisneros]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sandracisneros.com/|title=Sandra Cisneros Website|last=|first=|date=|website=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and named after the town in [[Gabriel García Márquez|Gabriel García]] Marquez's ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude]]'', the workshop gathers writers from all genres who work on geographic, cultural, economic, gender, and spiritual borders. An essential aspect of the Macondo Workshop is a global sense of community; participants recognize their place as writers in our society and the world.

==History==
Macondo began over twenty years ago when author Sandra Cisneros gathered a group of writers, artists, scholars and activists around her dining table in her King William home to meet informally for rigorous writing workshops. Under the direction of Cisneros, and during its brief time at the Guadalupe Cultural Arts Center, membership grew significantly. As such, Macondo has very established traditions and expectations that include a rigorous application process aimed at professional writers of all genres, and the "Compassionate Code of Conduct," a document drafted by a group of past Macondistas outlining the principles and ethics that govern our organization. Macondo has over two hundred lifetime members, many of whom have been with the association from the beginning and who continue to receive support from the Macondo community.

'''Makaton''' is a language programme designed to provide a means of communication to individuals who cannot communicate efficiently by speaking.&lt;ref name = "Beukelman 2005"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Beukelman | first1 = David R. | last2 = Mirenda | first2 = Pat. | title = Augmentative  alternative communication : supporting children  adults with complex communication need | year = 2005 | publisher = Paul H.

The name "Makaton" is derived from the first letters of the names of three [[speech and language therapist]]s who helped devise the programme in the 1970s: the researcher Margaret Walker, and Katharine Johnston and Tony Cornforth, colleagues from the [[Royal Association for Deaf people]].&lt;ref name="Sheehy 2009"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://oro.open.ac.uk/19897/1/SheehyDuffy_Makaton_112009_No_2.pdf |title = Attitudes to Makaton in the ages of integration and inclusion | format = pdf|author1=Sheehy, K.  |author2=Duffy, H.  |lastauthoramp=yes | work = International Journal of Special Education, 24(2), pp. 91–102| accessdate= 30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Makaton is a registered trade mark of The Makaton Charity, which was established in 2007.&lt;ref name="The Makaton Charity"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.makaton.org/ |title=The Makaton Charity |accessdate=29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original trademark application for Makaton was filed in the UK on 28 August 1979, with registration approved as from that date under UK trade mark registration no. 1119745.&lt;ref name="Intellectual Property Office - By number results"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipo.gov.uk/tmcase/Results/1/UK00001119745 |title=MAKATON - UK00001119745 |work=Intellectual Property Office - By number results |accessdate=29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 the Oxford University Press included Makaton as a common usage word in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]]. The entry states "Makaton, n. Brit. A proprietary name for: a language programme integrating speech, manual signs, and graphic symbols, developed to help people for whom communication is very difficult, esp. those with learning disabilities."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/search?q=Makaton|title=Oxford Index Search Results - oi|website=oxfordindex.oup.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

==Programme==
The Makaton Language Programme uses a multimodal approach to teach [[language]] and [[literacy]] skills, through a combination of speech, [[sign (semiotics)|sign]]s, and [[symbols|graphic symbols]] used concurrently, or, only with speech with signs, or, only with speech with graphic symbols as appropriate for the student's needs.&lt;ref name="Grove Walker 1990"/&gt; It consists of a Core Vocabulary of roughly 450 concepts that are taught in a specific order (there are 8 different stages). For example, stage 1 involves teaching vocabulary for immediate needs, like 'eat' and 'drink'.  Later stages contain more complex and abstract vocabulary such as time and emotions.  Once basic communication has been established, the student can progress in their language use, using whatever modes are most appropriate.&lt;ref name="Grove Walker 1990"/&gt; Also, although the programme is organised in stages, it can be modified and tailored to the individual's needs.&lt;ref name = "Beukelman 2005"/&gt; In addition to the Core Vocabulary, there is a Makaton Resource Vocabulary of over 7,000 concepts which are illustrated with signs and graphic symbols.&lt;ref name="Grove Walker 1990"/&gt;

==Development==
Original research was conducted by  Margaret Walker in 1972/73,&lt;ref name=w&gt;Walker, M (1977) Teaching Sign Language to Deaf Mentally Handicapped Adults (A Practical Account and an Experimental Evaluation) in IMS Conference Proceedings 3, Language and the Mentally Handicapped (pp3-25)Kidderminster: British Institute of Mental Handicap&lt;/ref&gt; and resulted in the design of the Makaton Core Vocabulary based on functional need. This research was conducted with [[institutionalised]] [[deaf]] cognitively impaired adults resident at [[Botleys Mansion|Botleys Park Hospital]] in [[Chertsey]], Surrey (closed in 2008). The aim was to enable them to communicate using signs from Sign Language.&lt;ref name="Grove Walker 1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Byler 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Byler| first1=Judy Kay|title=The Makaton Vocabulary: An Analysis based on Recent Research| journal=British Journal of Special Education| volume=12|issue=3| year=2007|pages=109–116| doi=10.1111/j.1467-8578.1985.tb00622.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walker 1981"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Walker M, Armfield A |title=What is the Makaton vocabulary? |journal=Spec Educ Forward Trends |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=19–20 |date=September 1981 |pmid=6458105 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fourteen deaf and cognitively impaired adults participated in the pilot study, and all were able to learn to use manual signs; improved behaviour was also noted.&lt;ref name="Grove Walker 1990"/&gt; Shortly after, the Core Vocabulary was revised to include both children and adults with severe communication difficulties (including individuals who could hear), and was used in many schools throughout the UK in order to stimulate communication and language.&lt;ref name="Grove Walker 1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Byler 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Walker 1981"/&gt; In the early stages of development, Makaton used only speech and manual signs (without symbols).&lt;ref name="Grove Walker 1990"/&gt; By 1985, work had begun to include graphic symbols in the Makaton Language Programme and a version including graphic symbols was published in 1986.&lt;ref name ="Grove Walker 1990"/&gt; The Core Vocabulary was revised in 1986 to include additional cultural concepts. The Makaton Vocabulary Development Project (MVDP) was founded in 1976 by Margaret Walker, who worked in a voluntary capacity as director until her retirement in October 2008.  The first Makaton training Workshop was held in 1976 and supporting resources and further training courses were, and continue, to be developed. In 1983 the MVDP became a Charitable Trust and in 2007 changed its status to become the Makaton Charity.&lt;ref name="Grove Walker 1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Byler 2007"/&gt;

== Use ==

The Makaton Core Vocabulary is adapted for use in different countries; signs from each country's [[deaf community]] are used, along with culturally relevant Makaton symbols.&lt;ref name = "Beukelman 2005"/&gt; For example, in the [[United Kingdom]], Makaton uses signs from [[British Sign Language]] (BSL); the signs are mainly from the London and South East England regional dialect.&lt;ref name=lsers&gt;Elton, Frances and Squelch, Linda ''London and South East Regional Signs''. Lexisigns (2009), http://www.lexisigns.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;  Makaton is used extensively throughout the UK, but has also been adapted for use in over 40 countries, including [[Poland]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Portugal]], [[Greece]], [[Kuwait]] and [[Japan]].&lt;ref name = "Beukelman 2005"/&gt; Within the UK, a variant "Say It and Sign It" from the West Sussex sign support system has been adopted by multiple nurseries and private courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.singandsign.co.uk/baby-signing/what-is-sing-and-sign}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 November 2018, comedian [[Rob Delaney]] read a book on the [[BBC]]'s children's channel [[CBeebies]] entirely in Makaton and English; he had used Makaton to communicate with his late son Henry, who was rendered unable to talk after a [[tracheotomy]].&lt;ref name=news&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC News|title=Rob Delaney to read and sign CBeebies story|date=2018|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-46262639}}{{primary source-inline|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maksim Adamavič Bahdanovič''' ([[Belarusian language]]: ''Максім Адамавіч Багдановіч'', {{IPA-be|makˈsʲɪm əˈdamɐvit͡ɕ bəɣdɐnˈovit͡ɕ|}}, {{lang-ru|Максим Адамович Богданович|translit=Maksim Adamovich Bogdanovich}}, 9 December 1891 – 25 May 1917) was a [[Belarus]]ian poet, journalist, [[translation|translator]], [[literary criticism|literary critic]] and historian of literature. He is considered as one of founders of the modern [[Belarusian language]].&lt;ref name=archives&gt;[http://archives.gov.by/index.php?id=898926 Maksim Bahdanovich: life and works (Максім Багдановіч: асоба і творчасць)]. Archives of Belarus.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Bahdanovič was born in [[Minsk]] in the family of [[Adam Bahdanovič]], an important Belarusian ethnographer who through most of his career worked as a [[bank clerk]].&lt;ref name=archives/&gt; Maksim was born in a family apartment at Karakazov House located at [[Trinity Hill]] where beside the Bahdanovich's apartment was located the First Parish School. His father was of unlanded peasantry family, while his mother (née Myakota) was of old Belarusian noble family of Kurcz coat of arms that was not adopted in the [[Russian Empire]].&lt;ref name=archives/&gt; Grandfather on his mother side, Apanas Janovich Myakota, was a Russian veteran of the [[Crimean War]] who for his military service received a lifelong nobility.&lt;ref name=archives/&gt; Both of Maksim parents graduated pedagogical schools.&lt;ref name=archives/&gt; Later father of Maksim, Adam, was involved with members of the revolutionary anti-tsarist [[Narodnaya Volya]] organization.&lt;ref name=archives/&gt;

In 1892 the family moved to [[Hrodna]] where Maksim's father received a job at local bank. Soon after the move the future poet's mother, Maria, died of [[tuberculosis]] in 1896.

In 1896 Adam Bahdanovič moved with his children to [[Nizhny Novgorod]], [[Russia]]. At that time Maksim wrote his first poems in the [[Belarusian language]]. In 1902 Bahdanovič attended a gymnasium. During the [[Revolution of 1905]] he was an active participant of the strikes organised by his commilitodes.

In 1907 [[Nasha Niva]] came out with Bahdanovič's first published work &amp;mdash; the novel ''Muzyka''.

In June 1908 the poet's family moved to [[Yaroslavl']]. After finishing school in 1911 Bahdanovič went to [[Belarus]] to meet important figures of the Belarusian Renaissance: [[Vaclau Lastouski]], [[Ivan Luckievich]] and [[Anton Luckievich]].
In the same year he began studying of law at a Yaroslavl' lyceum. During his studies Bahdanovič worked at a newspaper, wrote numerous works of literature and was actively published in both [[Belarus]] and [[Russia]].

In the beginning of 1914 his only book of poems, ''Vianok'' (''A Wreath''), was published in Vilna (today [[Vilnius]]).

In the summer of 1916, after absolvation of the lyceum, Maksim Bahdanovič moved to [[Minsk]] and worked there at the local [[guberniya]] administration.

In February 1917 Bahdanovič went to [[Crimea]] to be treated for [[tuberculosis]]. The treatment was unsuccessful, and that year he died in [[Yalta]].

The poet's papers were kept at his father's house, but the collection was heavily damaged during the [[Russian Civil War]] in 1918.

== His standing in Belarusian literature ==
In 1991–1995 a full collection of Bahdanovich's poetry was published in [[Belarus]].

Nowadays there are museums of the poet open in [[Minsk]] ([[Maksim Bahdanovič Literary Museum]]), [[Hrodna]] and [[Yaroslavl']]. Several streets in major cities of Belarus and Russia are named after him.

The [[opera]]s [[Zorka Venera (opera)|Zorka Venera]] (by [[Jury Siemianiaka]] and [[Ales' Bachyla]]), and  [[Maksim (opera)|Maksim]] (by [[Ihar Palivoda]]).

Bahdanovich created many examples of social, artistic and philosophical lyrics. He was the first poet to introduce several new lyrical forms to Belarusian literature.

Maksim Bahdanovich was a translator of [[Paul Verlaine]], [[Heinrich Heine]], [[Alexander Pushkin]], [[Ovid]], [[Horace]] and other poets into Belarusian and of [[Janka Kupala]], [[Taras Shevchenko]], [[Ivan Franko]] into [[Russian language|Russian]].

The '''Mbo language''' (or Imbo, Kimbo) is spoken by the [[Mbo people (Congo)|Mbo people]] in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. In 1994 there were about 11,000 speakers. It is lexically similar to the [[Ndaka language|Ndaka]] and [[Budu language|Budu]], [[Vanuma language|Vanuma]] and [[Nyali language|Nyali]] languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9769">'''Multi-competence''' is a concept in [[second language acquisition]] formulated by [[Vivian Cook (academic)|Vivian Cook]] that refers to the knowledge of more than one [[language]] in one person's [[mind]].&lt;ref name="Cook2008p11"&gt;{{Harvnb|Cook|2008|p=11}}.&lt;/ref&gt; From the multicompetence perspective, the different languages a person speaks are seen as one connected system, rather than each language being a separate system. People who speak a [[second language]] are seen as unique multilingual individuals, rather than people who have merely attached another language to their repertoire.

The concept has been backed up by studies showing how the different languages a person learns affect each other. The phenomenon of [[language transfer]], or the first language affecting the second, has long been known. More recent research has also shown that the second language also affects the first in various subtle ways. There is also evidence that people who learn other languages gain general cognitive benefits.

Under multi-competence, the second language speaker is seen as more than the sum of the languages he speaks. This is in contrast with the assumption in much of second language research that the ideal model of a language is the monolingual [[first language|native speaker]]. Setting the native speaker as the golden standard implies that second language speakers are somehow deficient in each language that they speak, whereas multi-competence sees them as having gained from learning a second language.

To avoid implying deficiency on the part of second language speakers, Cook prefers the term ''L2 user'' to ''L2 learner''. An ''L2 user'' is anyone who knows a second language and uses it regularly, irrespective of their language level.&lt;ref name="Cook2008p11" /&gt;

==Nature of the L2 user==
Central to Cook's argument is the way in which people's language knowledge changes when they learn a second language. He makes three main points:&lt;ref name="Cook2008pp231-232"&gt;{{Harvnb|Cook|2008|pp=231–232}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* L2 users' knowledge of the second language is not the same as native speakers' knowledge of that language.
* L2 users' knowledge of their first language is not the same as that of monolingual native speakers.
* L2 users think in different ways than monolinguals.

===Knowledge of the second language===
People learning a second language rarely reach the same level of competence as native speakers. In fact, by definition, they can never become a native speaker of another language. Very few L2 users are at a level where they can pass for a native speaker, but even their knowledge is not exactly the same as that of monolingual native speakers. Most L2 users are immediately identifiable by their foreign accent, and often by their syntax or choice of words. Cook argues that this is not a negative thing, and that L2 users should not be judged to the same standards as monolinguals. Rather, they should be held to the standard of successful L2 users.

===Knowledge of the first language===
When people learn a second language, the way they speak their first language changes in subtle ways. These changes can be with any aspect of language, from pronunciation and syntax to gestures the learner makes and the things they tend to notice.&lt;ref name="Cook2008p232"&gt;{{Harvnb|Cook|2008|p=232}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, French speakers who spoke English as a second language pronounced the /t/ sound in French differently from monolingual French speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Flege|1987}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, advanced English users of French judged the grammaticality of English sentences differently from English monolinguals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Balcom|1995}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, when shown a fish tank, Chinese speakers of English tend to remember more fish and less plants than Chinese monolinguals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cook|2008|p=8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This evidence suggests that language systems inside a person's mind cannot be viewed as completely separate from one another.

===Thought processes===
{{See also|Cognitive advantages to bilingualism}}
L2 users think more flexibly than monolinguals, are more [[Metalinguistic awareness|aware of language in general]], and have better attitudes towards other cultures. For example, English children who had Italian lessons for one hour a week had higher word awareness in English than children who had no language lessons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yelland|Pollard|Mercuri|1993}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
At the time the term "multi-competence" was coined, SLA research often relied on comparing an L2 user to native speakers of the L2 using methods of error analysis.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |title=Understanding second language process. |editor-last=Han |editor-first=ZhaoHong |publisher=Multilingual Matters |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-84769-014-2 |location=Clevedon, England |pages=16–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "errors" are usually defined by deviations from language norms and/or grammar rules. L2 users can also be measured based on how well they imitate typical native speakers.

SLA research has suggested a bidirectional influence exists between a bilingual's L1 and L2. The foundational linguistic skills acquired during L1 learning are also utilized during L2 learning, meaning pre-existing L1 knowledge influences incoming L2 knowledge. Going in the other direction, an L2 user's [[interlanguage]] can also influence their L1 knowledge, a process known as "reverse transfer".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; L2 knowledge can influence the L1 in early acquisition stages as well as in later learning. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Psycholinguistics of Bilingualism|last = Grosjean|first = Francois|publisher = Wiley-Blackwell|year = 2013|isbn = 978-1-4443-3279-7|location = West Sussex (UK)|pages = 158}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reverse transfer can result in an L2 user making mistakes when communicating in their L1. In extreme cases reverse transfer can lead to the loss of L1 knowledge. However, these effects are not always negative; L2 users often experience improved L1 reading and writing skills, as well as increased creativity.

A new theory posits that an L2-user has a single lexicon, enabling parallel access to words in both their L1 and L2.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When an L2 user is asked to name (or pronounce) words from their L1, units in the presented words that are also found in the user's L2 can be distractors and therefore increase reaction time and/or error rate. If there were separate lexicons for each language, then an L2 user should not become distracted by L2 word units when accessing their L1 knowledge. L2 users often have different voice-onset time (VOT)s than the average speaker of either their L1 or L2. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Understanding second language process|last = Cook|first = Vivian|publisher = Multilingual Matters|year = 2008|isbn = 978-1-84769-014-2|location = North York (ON)|pages = |chapter = Multi-competence: Black hole or wormhole for second language acquisition research?|editor-last = Han|editor-first = ZhaoHong}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications for language teaching==
Multi-competence has two major implications for language teaching. The first is about the question of what the final goal should be for language learners. The multi-competence viewpoint sees the goal of learning as becoming a successful L2 user. Language teaching, therefore, should reflect this: the goals of language learning should be based on what successful L2 users can do, not what monolingual native speakers can do. Also, teaching materials should show positive examples of L2 use and L2 users.&lt;ref name="Cook2008p232" /&gt;

The second implication is for the use of the first language in the classroom. If the first language can never truly be separated from the second language in the mind, it makes no sense to forbid the use of the first language in the language classroom. Cook argues that banning the use of the first language will not stop learners from using it to help with their language learning, it will only make its use invisible to the teacher. Instead, Cook suggests that teachers should think about how they can make use of both languages in suitable ways.&lt;ref name="Cook2008p232" /&gt;

'''Olav Reiersøl''' (28 June 1908 – 14 February 2001) was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[statistician]] and [[econometrics|econometrician]], who made several substantial contributions to [[econometrics]] and [[statistics]]. His works on [[identifiability]] and [[instrumental variable]]s are standard references both in econometrics and statistics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Qin |first=Duo |title=The Formation of Econometrics: A Historical Perspective |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1993 |isbn=0-19-828388-1 |pages=84–86 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NIqMd5EX-CgC&amp;pg=PA84 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and his work on genetic algebras are frequently cited in [[genetics]].

Reiersøl became interested in the international language [[Esperanto]] at a young age, and later in life used it to keep in touch with other mathematicians. He was one of the founders of the Esperanto association ''Internacia Asocio de Esperantistaj Matematikistoj'' ("International Association of Esperantist Mathematicians").&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.cambridge.org/production/action/cjoGetFulltext?fulltextid=34986 "The ET Interview: Reiersøl Olav"] ''Econometric Theory'', 16, 2000, 113-125.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was made a fellow of the [[Econometric Society]] in 1952.

{{Zoroastrianism}}
'''Pazend [[Help:IPA/English|/ˈpə'zend/]]''' or '''Pazand''' Middle Persian: 𐭯𐭠𐭰𐭭𐭣 Avestan: ''𐬞𐬀𐬌𐬙𐬌 𐬰𐬀𐬌𐬥𐬙𐬌‎'' is one of the [[writing system]]s used for the [[Middle Persian]] language. It was based on the [[Avestan alphabet]], a phonetic alphabet originally used to write [[Avestan language|Avestan]], the language of the [[Avesta]], the primary sacred texts of [[Zoroastrianism]].

Pazend's principal use was for writing the commentaries (''Zend'') on and/or translations of the Avesta. The word "Pazend" ultimately derives from the Avestan words ''paiti zainti'', &lt;!-- Dhalla. ''Zend'' is middle Persian for ''âzainti'' in Avestan --&gt;which can be translated as either "for commentary purposes" or "according to understanding" (phonetically).

Pazend had the following characteristics, both of which are to be contrasted with [[Pahlavi script|Pahlavi]], which is one of the other systems used to write Middle Persian:
*Pazend was a variant of the [[Avestan alphabet]] (''Din dabireh''), which was a [[Phonetic transcription|phonetic]] alphabet. In contrast, Pahlavi script was only an [[abjad]]. 
*Pazend did not have [[ideograms]]. In contrast, ideograms were an identifying feature of the Pahlavi system, and these ''[[Frahang-i Pahlavig|huzvarishn]]'' were words borrowed from [[Semitic languages]] such as [[Aramaic]] that continued to be spelled as in Aramaic (in Pahlavi script) but were pronounced as the corresponding word in Persian.

[[Image:Avestan-LE.jpg|thumb|300px|left|A Pazend title (for a published [[Avesta]]) that reads ''pargart auual'' (as transliterated in the Hoffmann system) and demonstrates the use of the ''el'' grapheme (leftmost symbol here, resembling a Latin 'p'). This letter was added to the alphabet specifically for use in Pazend script; it is not needed for writing the [[Avestan language]].]]

In combination with its religious purpose, these features constituted a "sanctification" of written Middle Persian. The use of the Avestan alphabet to write Middle Persian required the addition of one symbol to the Avestan alphabet: This character, to support Middle Persian's {{IPA|/l/}}, phoneme had not previously been needed.

Following the fall of the [[Sassanid dynasty|Sassanids]], after which Zoroastrianism came to be gradually supplanted by [[Islam]], Pazend lost its purpose and soon ceased to be used for original composition. In the late 11th or early 12th century, Indian Zoroastrians (the [[Parsi]]s) began translating Avestan or Middle Persian texts into Sanskrit and Gujarati. Some Middle Persian texts were also ''transcribed'' into the Avestan alphabet. The latter process, being a form of interpretation, was known as 'pa-zand'. "Pazand texts, transcribed phonetically, represent a late and often corrupt Middle Persian pronunciation, and so present their own problems."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Boyce|first=Mary|chapter=Sanskrit, Old Gujarati and Pazand writings|title=Textual sources for the study of Zoroastrianism|year=1984|publisher=Manchester UP|p=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "The corruptions during this process are sometimes considerable."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Boyce|first=Mary|chapter=Middle Persian literature: The later religious writings|p=47&lt;!--32-66--&gt;|title=Iranistik II: Literatur|series=Handbuch der Orientalistik, vol 4|year=1968|location=Leiden|publisher=Brill}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the transcribed texts are the prefaces (''dibacheh'') to prayers in Avestan. These prefatory prayers are invariably written in Pazend because of the need for "accurate" pronunciation. This practice has led to the misconception that "Pazend" is the name of a language.

Following [[Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron]]'s translation of some of the texts of the Avesta in the late 18th century, the term "Zend-Avesta" was mistakenly used to refer to the sacred texts themselves (as opposed to commentaries on them). This usage subsequently led to the equally mistaken use of "Pazend" for the Avestan script as such and  "Zend" for the Avestan language.&lt;!-- cf Ethnologue report for Avestan (SIL: avs)--&gt;

{{Punctuation marks|¶}}
The '''pilcrow''' ('''¶'''), also called the '''paragraph mark''', '''paragraph sign''', '''paraph''', '''alinea''' ([[Latin]]: ''a lineā'', "off the line"), or '''blind P''',&lt;ref name = style&gt;{{Cite book |title=Style manual |url=http://australia.gov.au/publications/style-manual |edition=3 |year=1978 |publisher=Australian government publishing service |location=Canberra |chapter=Notes, references and bibliographies: Notes}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[typographical]] [[glyph|character]] for individual [[paragraph]]s. It is present in [[Unicode]] as {{unichar|00B6|PILCROW SIGN|html=}}.

The pilcrow can be used as an indent for separate [[paragraphs]] or to designate a new paragraph in one long piece of copy, as [[Eric Gill]] did in his 1930s book ''An Essay on Typography''. The pilcrow was a type of [[rubrication]] used in the [[Middle Ages]] to mark a new [[train of thought]], before the convention of visually discrete paragraphs was commonplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/design/2013/07/the-origin-of-the-pilcrow-aka-the-strange-paragraph-symbol/ |title=The Origin of the Pilcrow, aka the Strange Paragraph Symbol |work=Design Decoded (a Smithsonian blog) |date=2013-07-10 |last=Stamp |first=Jimmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pilcrow is usually drawn similar to a lowercase [[q]] reaching from [[descender]] to [[Ascender (typography)|ascender]] height; the loop can be filled or unfilled. It may also be drawn with the bowl stretching further downwards, resembling a backwards [[D]]; this is more often seen in older printing.

==Origin and name==
[[File:GNM3227a 6r.jpg|thumb|Three short paragraphs on making [[gunpowder]] in the manuscript [[GNM 3227a]] (Germany, c. 1400); the first paragraph is marked with an early form of the pilcrow sign, the two following paragraphs are introduced with ''litterae notabiliores'' (literally: enlarged letters).]]
[[File:Villanova-rudimenta-grammaticæ-Valencia-1500.jpg|thumb|Pilcrow signs in an excerpt from a page of ''Villanova, Rudimenta Grammaticæ'', printed by Spindeler in 1500 in Valencia.&lt;ref&gt;Updike, Daniel Berkeley, ''Printing Type – their History, Forms, and Use'', 1922. Vol. I, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Image:Pilcrow-history.svg|thumb|Possible development from ''capitulum'' to contemporary paragraph symbol.&lt;ref&gt;Parkes, "The Development of the General Repertory of Punctuation", 43.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The word ''pilcrow'' originates from the Greek word ''paragraphos''. This was rendered in Old French as ''paragraphe'' and later changed to ''pelagraphe''. The earliest reference of the modern ''pilcrow'' is in 1440 with the Middle English word ''pylcrafte''.&lt;ref&gt;K. Houston, "The Pilcrow", ''Shady Characters''. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first way to divide sentences into groups in Ancient Greek was the original ''paragraphos'', which was a horizontal line in the margin to the left of the main text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4DwjAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA3&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The History of the English Paragraph|date=1894|page=9|author=Edwin Herbert Lewis}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the ''paragraphos'' became more popular, the horizontal line eventually changed into the Greek letter Gamma (Γ and γ) and later into ''litterae notabiliores'', which were enlarged letters at the beginning of a paragraph.&lt;ref&gt;Parkes, "Introduction," 10; M. B. Parkes, "Glossary of Technical Terms", in ''Pause and Effect: Punctuation in the West'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1993). 305.&lt;/ref&gt; This notation soon changed to the letter K, an abbreviation for the Latin word ''kaput'', which translates as "head", i.e. it marks the head of a new thesis.&lt;ref&gt;Parkes, "Antiquity", 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, to mark a new section, the Latin word ''capitulum'', which translates as "little head", was used, and the letter C came to mark a new section in 300 BC.&lt;ref&gt;David Sacks, "K and its Kompetitors", in ''The Alphabet: Unravelling the Mystery of the Alphabet from A to Z'' (London: Hutchinson, 2003), 206.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1100s, C had completely replaced K as the symbol for a new chapter.&lt;ref&gt;M. B. Parkes, "The Development of the General Repertory of Punctuation", in ''Pause and Effect: Punctuation in the West'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1993), 43.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rubrication|Rubricators]] eventually added one or two vertical bars to the C to stylize it (as ⸿); the symbol was filled in with dark ink and eventually looked like the modern pilcrow (¶).&lt;ref&gt;Parkes, "The Development of the General Repertory of Punctuation", 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern use==
Scribes would often leave space before paragraphs to allow [[Rubrication|rubricators]] to draw the pilcrow. With the introduction of the printing press, space before paragraphs was still left for rubricators to draw by hand; however, rubricators could not draw fast enough for printers and often would leave the beginnings of the paragraphs as blank. This is how the indent before paragraphs was created.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Tschichold and Robert Bringhurst, "Why the Beginnings of Paragraphs Must Be Indented", in ''The Form of the Book'' (London: Lund Humphries, 1991), 105–109.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the pilcrow remains in use in modern time in the following ways:

In [[legal writing]], it is used whenever one must [[Legal citation|cite]] a specific paragraph within [[pleadings]], [[law review]] articles, [[statute]]s, or other legal documents and materials.

In academic writing, it is sometimes{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} used as an in-text referencing tool to make reference to a specific paragraph from a document that does not contain page numbers, allowing the reader to find where that particular idea or statistic was sourced. The pilcrow sign followed by a number indicates the paragraph number from the top of the page. It is rarely used when citing books or journal articles.

In [[proofreading]], it indicates that one paragraph should be split into two or more separate paragraphs. The proofreader inserts the pilcrow at the point where a new paragraph should begin.

In some [[high-church]] [[Anglican]] and [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] churches, it is used in the printed order of service to indicate that instructions follow; these indicate when the [[local church|congregation]] should stand, sit, and kneel, who participates in various portions of the service, and similar information. [[King's College, Cambridge]] uses this convention in the service [http://www.kings.cam.ac.uk/files/services/festival-nine-lessons-2010.pdf booklet] for the [[Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols]]. This is analogous to the writing of these instructions in red in some rubrication conventions.

[[Online]], it is used in some blogs and wikis to denote [[permalink]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/05/31/PurpleAgain |title=ongoing — Purple Pilcrows |publisher=Tbray.org |date=2004-05-31 |accessdate=2011-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{clarify span|cf. [[Purple Numbers]]|redirects to Douglas Engelbart, where "purple" does not appear at all|date=April 2018}}).

The pilcrow is used in [[desktop publishing software]] such as desktop [[word processor]]s and [[page layout]] programs to mark the presence of a [[carriage return]] [[control character]] at the end of a paragraph. It is also used as the [[icon (computing)|icon]] on a [[toolbar]] button that shows or hides the pilcrow and similar ''hidden characters'', including [[tab key|tabs]], [[Whitespace (computer science)|whitespace]], and [[page break]]s. In [[typing]] programs, it marks a return that one must type.

The pilcrow may indicate a [[footnote]] in a convention using a sequence of distinct typographic symbols in sequence to distinguish the footnotes on a given page; it is the sixth in a series of footnote symbols beginning with the [[asterisk]].&lt;ref name = style /&gt;

==Encoding==
The pilcrow symbol is available in the [[default hardware codepage]] [[codepage 437|437]] of [[IBM PC]]s (and all other 8-bit [[OEM codepage]]s based on this) at code point 20 (0x14), sharing its position with the [[ASCII]] [[control code]] [[DC4 (control code)|DC4]] (to the effect that it isn't easily accessible in most software under this position).

The pilcrow [[Character (computing)|character]] was in the 1984 [[Multinational Character Set]] extension of [[ASCII]] at 0xB6 (decimal 182), from where it was inherited by [[ISO/IEC 8859-1]] (1987) and by [[Unicode]] as U+00B6 ¶ {{sc|pilcrow sign}}.
 
The [[html entity]] is &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;para;&lt;/code&gt;, introduced in [[HTML 3.2]] (1997). In [[LaTeX]], the pilcrow glyph is invoked by &lt;code&gt;\P&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;\textpilcrow&lt;/code&gt;.

Apart from {{unichar|00B6|Pilcrow sign|dec=}}, Unicode also defines {{unichar|204B|reversed pilcrow sign|dec=}}, {{unichar|2761|curved stem paragraph sign ornament|dec=}}, and {{unichar|2e3f|capitulum}}.

===Typing character===
* [[Classic Mac OS]] and [[macOS]]: {{key press|[[Option key|Opt]]|7}}
* [[Vim (text editor)|Vim]], in insert mode: {{key press|[[Ctrl key|Ctrl]]|K}} {{key press|P}}{{key press|I}}
* [[DOS]] [[Alt code]]: {{key press|[[Alt key|Alt]]|2}}{{key press|0}} (depending on the software used, it is not always accessible as graphical symbol due to the fact that it shares its code point with the [[control code]] [[DC4 (control code)|DC4]]).
* [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] [[Alt code]]: {{key press|[[Alt key|Alt]]|0}}{{key press|1}}{{key press|8}}{{key press|2}} or {{key press|[[Alt key|Alt]]|2}}{{key press|0}} (on numeric keypad).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Windows Alt Key Codes |url=http://tlt.its.psu.edu/suggestions/international/accents/codealt.html#punc |year=2010 |publisher=Penn State University |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5rE4nERN0?url=http://tlt.its.psu.edu/suggestions/international/accents/codealt.html#punc |archivedate=2010-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the font used, this character varies in appearance, and in some cases, may be replaced by an alternate [[glyph]] entirely.

Tools may be required to easily generate a pilcrow, or other special characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=iPad Writing Tool |url=http://idevicesworld.com/features/cymbol#pilcrow |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110620055218/http://idevicesworld.com/features/cymbol#pilcrow |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-06-20 |year=2011 |publisher=iDevices World – Australia }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paragraph signs in non-Latin writing systems==
In [[Chinese language|Chinese]], the traditional paragraph sign (rendered as 〇) is a thin [[circle]] about the same size as a [[Chinese character]]. This same mark also serves as a “zero” character, as a [[Style (fiction)|stylistic]] variation of the [[Chinese language|Chinese]] character for “zero”. As a paragraph sign, this mark only appears in older [[books]], commonly found in the [[Chinese Union Version]] of the Bible. Its current use is generally as a “[[zero]]” character. However, it can also be found in some editions of the [[King James Bible]] and the [[Book of Mormon]].

In [[Thai language|Thai]], the character {{unichar|0e5b|Thai character Khomut|nlink=Khomut}} can mark the end of a [[chapter (books)|chapter]] or [[document]].

In [[Sanskrit]] and other [[Languages of India|Indian languages]], text blocks used to be written in stanzas. Two bars || represented a pilcrow.

The '''Quranic Arabic Corpus''' is an annotated linguistic resource consisting of 77,430 words of Quranic Arabic. The project aims to provide morphological and syntactic annotations for researchers wanting to study the language of the Quran.&lt;ref name="dukes1"&gt;K. Dukes, E. Atwell and N. Habash (2011).

==Functions==
The grammatical analysis helps readers further in uncovering the detailed intended meanings of each verse and sentence. Each word of the Quran is tagged with its part-of-speech as well as multiple morphological features. Unlike other annotated Arabic corpora, the grammar framework adopted by the Quranic Corpus is the traditional Arabic grammar of [[i'rab]] ({{lang|ar|'''إﻋﺮﺍﺏ'''}}). The research project is led by [[Kais Dukes]] at the [[University of Leeds]],&lt;ref name=tri/&gt; and is part of the Arabic language computing research group within the School of Computing, supervised by Eric Atwell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comp.leeds.ac.uk/eric|title=Profile for Dr Eric Atwell - School of Computing - University of Leeds|first=|last=Engineering|website=www.comp.leeds.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dublin, Ireland.&lt;/ref&gt;

* A manually verified [[Part-of-speech tagging|part-of-speech]] tagged Quranic Arabic corpus. 
* An annotated [[treebank]] of Quranic Arabic. 
* A novel visualization of traditional [[Arabic grammar]] through dependency graphs. 
* Morphological search for the Quran. 
* A machine-readable morphological lexicon of Quranic words into English. 
* A part-of-speech [[concordance (publishing)|concordance]] for Quranic Arabic organized by lemma.
* An online message board for community volunteer annotation.

Corpus annotation assigns a part-of-speech tag and morphological features to each word. For example, annotation involves deciding whether a word is a noun or a verb, and if it is inflected for masculine or feminine. The first stage of the project involved automatic part-of-speech tagging by applying Arabic language computing technology to the text. The annotation for each of the 77,430 words in the Quran was then reviewed in stages by two annotators, and improvements are still ongoing to further improve accuracy.

Linguistic research for the Quran that uses the annotated corpus includes training [[Hidden Markov model]] [[Part-of-speech tagging|part-of-speech]] taggers for Arabic,&lt;ref&gt;M. Albared, N.

'''Ramesh Chandra Jha''' (8 May 1928 – 7 April 1994) was an [[India]]n  [[poet]], [[novelist]] and [[freedom fighter]]. Son of a senior gandhian Lakshmi Narayan Jha, who was offered to become the first chief minister of bihar but refused as he called himself a freedom fighter then a politician. Ramesh Chandra Jha's poems, [[ghazal]]s and stories evoke patriotism and human values. Romanticism and struggle of life are also important aspects of his writing. His poetry expresses concerns of people's life struggle, their dreams and hopes.

His research published as ''Apne Aur Sapne : A Literary Journey Of Champaran'' in the 1960s traced the rich literary heritage of [[Champaran]] in [[Bihar]] and noted the upcoming young poets such as Dinesh Bhramar and Pandey Ashutosh.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/ApneAurSapneALitereryJourneyOfChamparanByRameshChandraJha/ Apne Aur Sapne : Online PDF book at Archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramesh Chandra Jha was born on 8 May 1928 in Fulwariya village of [[Sugauli]] in [[East Champaran district]], known as [[Motihari]], [[Bihar]]. His father, Laxmi Narayan Jha, was a well-known patriot and freedom fighter who fought against [[British Raj|British rule]] and was arrested many times, including on 15 April 1917 when [[Mahatma Gandhi]] visited Champaran for his [[Satyagrah]] movement. That incident inspired the son to become rebellious and he was convicted of robbery at the age of 14. Even Ramesh Jha created various chaos insie the jail and become problemtic for british officers.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Jha was not just a patriotic poet but went to jail many times during British rule because of his involvement in the [[Quit India Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gCnRzJwcqSQC&amp;redir_esc=y/ Bihar Through the Ages : Ritu Chaturvedi, S.R.Bakshi 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mf4p-Ll5w6sC/ Champaran to Quit India Movement : Mittal Publication 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; He was student of Hazarimal High School, [[Raxaul]] that time and was entrapped into several cases of the robbery at police stations during freedom struggle. In his school days he led student protest and was later thrown out from the school.

S. R. Bakshi and Ritu Chaturvedi in his research based book have said that {{quote|At his phulwariya village in great hardship, Gokul Thakur ordered Ramesh Chandra and Rama Kant Jha to go to Sugaon and to take account of the articles were removed and also the condition of imposed collective fines. Since both these persons view of prematured age, there was not much possibility of their being arrested. But both of them were arrested happily and imprisoned for two years under the Section 38(v) of the Indian safety act...&lt;ref&gt;Bihar Through The Ages&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While in jail, Jha studied [[Indian literature]] and after the [[independence of India]], like his father, rather than joining politics, he became a poet and novelist. In a Muktak (poem), Jha had expressed his feelings in a poetry- "जंगल झाड़ भरे खंडहर में सोया पाँव पसार, दलित ग़ुलाम देश का मारा हारा थका फ़रार..."{{clarify|reason=so what? this needs a translation|date=July 2016}}

==Honours and awards==

* 15 August 1972, on the 25th anniversary of Indian independence, [[Indira Gandhi]] awarded him with Tamra Patra for his participation in the Indian freedom struggle.
* Awarded by Dr Uday Narayan Tiwari Award on 2 October 1993 at the National Bhojpuri Language Summit in [[Raniganj]], [[West Bengal]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5151">A '''reception report''' is a means by which radio stations (usually [[shortwave|short-]] and [[Medium frequency|medium-wave]] broadcasters) receive detailed feedback from their listeners about the quality and content of their broadcasts. A reception report consists of several pieces of information which help the station verify that the report confirms coverage of their transmission, and usually include the following information:

*Date, time and frequency (in [[Hertz|kHz]]) of the transmission
*Station name
*Description of the [[interval signal]], if heard
*Programme details
*Name of announcers or programme host, if heard
*Details of the overall signal quality (normally using the [[SINPO]] code)

The listener's location relative to the station is also useful; this indicates how well the station's [[transmitter]] is performing and in which direction(s) its antenna is beaming the signal. The station also evaluates a reception report in light of the listener's [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]] and antenna. Upon receipt of a correct report, a broadcaster sometimes issues a letter or [[postcard]] (known as a [[QSL card]]) to the sender, thanking them and confirming that the details are correct.  "QSL" is part of the [[amateur radio]] [[Q code]], meaning "I acknowledge receipt". One aspect of [[DXing]] is collecting QSL cards and letters from stations heard (similar to a [[Birdwatching|birdwatcher's]] "life list"). QSLing a radio station involves writing an accurate reception report, mailing it to the station and awaiting a reply. Since QSLing is a voluntary act on the station's part, several techniques are used to improve a listener's success rate.

==Useful reception reports==
Station engineers and other personnel are primarily interested in whether or not their station is heard, and how well; therefore, a complete and accurate reception report (whether by postal or e-mail) is generally appreciated. To begin, report the frequency, date and time the station was heard. For medium-wave (AM) stations, the time should be that of the [[time zone]] in which the station is located. Thus, if a listener hears stations from the [[Eastern time zone]] of North America (such as Ontario and New York), [[Standard time|EST]] or [[Daylight saving time|EDT]] should be given (depending on the time of year). Stations in the [[Central Time Zone (North America)|Central time zone]] (such as [[Chicago]]) use CST or CDT, which is one hour earlier than Eastern time. If a listener is uncertain of the time zone, they should clearly indicate their local time or even better use [[UTC]]

It is helpful to jot down programming as it is heard. Useful details include:

*[[Station identification]]
*Program name
*Names of station announcers (such as a [[talk show]] host)
*Commercials (good indicators, because the station keeps a [[logbook]] of commercials
*Names of [[Broadcast syndication#Radio syndication|network programs]], such as "[[CNN]] News" or "[[The Sports Network|TSN Sports]]"

The purpose of providing this information is to prove to the station that you heard their program and not that of another station. The more detail a listener can provide, the better the chance of eliciting a QSL. Include information, also, about how well the signal was received. For medium-wave reports, an indication of signal strength and any interference ([[Co-channel interference|co-]] or [[adjacent-channel interference]], with identity of interfering station if possible) is usually sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dxinginfo.com/dx-guide-reception-reports-quick.html Quick Guide to Reception Reports]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531172957/http://www.dxinginfo.com/dx-guide-reception-reports-quick.html |date=May 31, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; International shortwave broadcasters are familiar with the [[SINPO]] code:

*'''S'''ignal strength
*'''I'''nterference (includes human-generated noise—for example, power-line hum)
*'''N'''oise ("white [[Noise (radio)|noise"]], or thunderstorm static)
*'''P'''ropagation disturbance ([[fading]])
*'''O'''verall reception quality

Each letter receives a value between 5 and 1, where 5 is the best and 1 the worst. Many shortwave listeners (known as "program listeners") desire nothing more than music and news from a broadcaster; however, for DXers a QSL collection is tangible proof of what they have heard. Some listeners use pre-printed forms if they are unfamiliar with the language spoken by station personnel.&lt;ref&gt;Writing Useful Reception Reports http://www.dxinginfo.com/dx-reception-reports.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531154511/http://www.dxinginfo.com/dx-reception-reports.html |date=May 31, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While major international broadcasters have not required return postage for a QSL, the growing popularity of e-mailed reception reports and e-QSLs has largely eliminated the necessity for [[international reply coupon]]s (IRCs), [[mint stamp]]s from the verifying station's country or "green stamps" (US dollar bills).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3938">In [[music]], a '''register''' is the "height" or [[range (music)|range]] of a [[Musical note|note]], [[set theory (music)|set]] of [[pitch (music)|pitches]] or [[pitch class]]es, [[melody]], part, [[musical instrument|instrument]], or group of instruments. A higher register indicates higher pitch. 
 
*Example 1: [[Violin]]s are in a higher register than [[cello]]s.

In [[woodwind instrument|woodwind]] and [[brass instruments]], the word '''register''' usually distinguishes pitch ranges produced using different [[normal mode]]s of the air column, with higher registers produced by [[overblowing]].  Often the [[timbre]]s of different woodwind instrument registers tend to be markedly different.

*Example 2: The [[Western concert flute]] plays approximately three and a half [[octave]]s and generally has three complete registers and one partial register. The musical note C4 (corresponding to [[middle C]] on the piano) would be in that instrument's first register, whereas C5 (one octave higher) would be in its second register.

However, on the [[clarinet]] the notes from ([[transposing instrument|written]]) G4 or A4 to B{{ music|flat}}4 sometimes are regarded as a separate "throat register", even though both they and the notes from F{{music|sharp}}4 down are produced using the instrument's lowest normal mode; the timbre of the throat notes differs, and the throat register's fingerings also are distinctive, using special keys and not the standard tone holes used for other notes.

The register in which an instrument plays, or in which a part is written, affects the quality of sound or timbre. Register is also used structurally in [[musical form]], with the climax of a piece usually being in the highest register of that piece. Often, serial and other pieces will use fixed register, allowing a pitch class to be expressed through only one pitch.

==Vocal register==

{{main|Vocal register}}

A "register" of the human voice is a series of tones of like quality originating through operation of the [[larynx]].  The constituent tones result from similar patterns of vibration in the [[vocal folds]], which can generate several different such patterns, each resulting in characteristic sounds within a particular range of pitches.&lt;ref name=Large&gt;{{cite journal 
|last=Large
|first= John
|date=February–March 1972
|title= Towards an Integrated Physiologic-Acoustic Theory of Vocal Registers
|journal= The NATS Bulletin
|volume= 28
|pages= 30–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term has wide application and can refer to any of several aspects of the human voice, including the following:

* A particular segment of the [[vocal range]];
* A [[resonance]] area such as [[chest voice]] or [[head voice]];
* A [[phonation|phonatory]] process;
* A certain vocal [[timbre]]; or
* A region of the voice set off by vocal breaks.&lt;ref name=McKinney&gt;{{cite book

|last= McKinney
|first= James
|year= 1994
|publisher= Genovex Music Group
|isbn=978-1-56593-940-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[speech pathology|Speech pathologists]] and many [[vocal pedagogy|vocal pedagogues]] recognize four vocal registers: the [[vocal fry register|vocal fry]], [[modal register|modal]], [[falsetto register|falsetto]], and [[whistle register|whistle]].  To delineate these registers, pathologists specify vibratory pattern of the vocal folds, sequential pitches, and type of sound.&lt;ref name=McKinney /&gt;

In a '''right-to-left, top-to-bottom''' [[writing system|script]] (commonly shortened to '''right to left''' or abbreviated '''RTL'''), writing starts from the right of the page and continues to the left. This can be contrasted against left-to-right [[Writing system|writing systems]], where writing starts from the left of the page and continues to the right.

[[Arabic script|Arabic]], [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]], [[Persian language|Persian]], and [[Urdu language|Urdu]] are the most widespread RTL writing systems in modern times.

''Right-to-left'' can also refer to '''{{TextDir|TB-RL|top-to-bottom, right-to-left}}''' (TB-RL or TBRL) scripts such as [[Chinese characters|Chinese]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and [[Korean language|Korean]], though they are also commonly written {{TextDir|LTR|words}}. Books designed for predominately TBRL vertical text open in the same direction as those for RTL horizontal text: the spine is on the right and pages are numbered from right-to-left.

== Uses ==
[[Arabic script|Arabic]], [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]], [[Persian language|Persian]], and [[Urdu language|Urdu]] are the most widespread RTL writing systems in modern times. As usage of the Arabic script spread, the [[Arabic alphabet|repertoire of 28 characters]] used to write [[Arabic language]] was supplemented to accommodate the sounds of many other languages such as [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Pashto]], etc. While the [[Hebrew alphabet]] is used to write [[Hebrew language]], it is also used to write other [[Jewish languages]] such as [[Yiddish]].

[[Syriac alphabet|Syriac]] and Mandaean (Mandaic) scripts are derived from [[Aramaic]] and are written RTL. [[Samaritan]] is similar, but developed from [[Proto-Hebrew]] rather than Aramaic. Many other ancient and historic scripts derived from Aramic and inherited its right-to-left direction.

Several languages have both Arabic RTL and non-Arabic LTR writing systems. For example, [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] is commonly written in Arabic and Devanagari scripts, and a number of others have been used. [[Kurdish languages|Kurdish]] may be written in Arabic, Latin, [[Cyrillic]] or Armenian script.

[[Thaana]] appeared around 1600 CE. Most modern scripts are LTR, but the African scripts [[N'Ko alphabet|N'Ko]] (1949), [[Mende Kikakui script|Mende Kikakui]] (19th century), [[Adlam alphabet|Adlam]] (1980s) and [[Hanifi script|Hanifi Rohingya]] (1980s) were created in modern times and are RTL.

Ancient examples of text using alphabets such as Phoenician, Greek, or Old Italic may exist variously in left-to-right, right-to-left, or [[boustrophedon]] order; so it is not always possible to classify some ancient writing systems as purely RTL or LTR.

==Computing support==
Right-to-left, top-to-bottom text is supported in common consumer software.&lt;ref&gt;http://dotancohen.com/howto/rtl_right_to_left.html&lt;/ref&gt; Often this support must be explicitly enabled. Right-to-left text can be mixed with left-to-right text in [[bi-directional text]].

==List of RTL scripts==
Examples of right-to-left scripts (with [[ISO 15924]] codes in brackets) are:

===Current scripts===
* [[Hebrew alphabet]] (&lt;code&gt;Hebr&lt;/code&gt; 125) – used for [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Yiddish]] and some other [[Jewish languages]].
* [[Arabic script]] (&lt;code&gt;Arab&lt;/code&gt; 160, &lt;code&gt;Aran&lt;/code&gt; 161) – used for [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Urdu]] and [[Arabic script|many other languages]].
* [[Syriac alphabet]] (&lt;code&gt;Syrc&lt;/code&gt; 135, variants 136–138 &lt;code&gt;Syrn Syrj Syre&lt;/code&gt;) – used for varieties of the [[Syriac language]].
* [[Samaritan alphabet]] (&lt;code&gt;Samr&lt;/code&gt; 123) – closely related to Hebrew, used for the [[Samaritans]]' writings. 
* [[Mandaic alphabet]] (&lt;code&gt;Mand&lt;/code&gt; 140) – closely related to Syriac, used for the [[Mandaic language]]. 
* [[Thaana]] (&lt;code&gt;Thaa&lt;/code&gt; 170) – used for [[Dhivehi language|Dhivehi]].
* [[Mende Kikakui]] (&lt;code&gt;Mend&lt;/code&gt; 438) – for Mende in Sierra Leone. Devised by Mohammed Turay and Kisimi Kamara in the late 19th century. Still used but only by about 500 people. 
* [[N'Ko script]] (&lt;code&gt;Nkoo&lt;/code&gt; 165) – devised for the [[Manding languages]] of West Africa.
* [[Fula alphabets#Adlam alphabet|Adlam]] (&lt;code&gt;Adlm&lt;/code&gt; 166) – devised in the 1980s for writing the [[Fula languages]] of West and Central Africa.
* [[Hanifi Rohingya script|Hanifi Rohingya]] (&lt;code&gt;Rohg&lt;/code&gt; 167) — developed in the 1980s for the [[Rohingya language]].

===Ancient scripts===
* [[Cypriot syllabary]] (&lt;code&gt;Cprt&lt;/code&gt; 403) – predates Phoenician influence.
* [[Phoenician alphabet]] (&lt;code&gt;Phnx&lt;/code&gt; 115) – ancient, precursor to Hebrew, Imperial Aramaic, and Greek.
* [[Imperial Aramaic alphabet]] (&lt;code&gt;Armi&lt;/code&gt; 124) – ancient, closely related to Hebrew and Phoenician. Spread widely by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Neo-Assyrian]] and [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] empires. The later [[Palmyrene alphabet|Palmyrene]] form (&lt;code&gt;Palm&lt;/code&gt; 126) was also used to write Aramaic.  
* [[Old South Arabian]] (&lt;code&gt;Sarb&lt;/code&gt;) 
* [[Old North Arabian]] (&lt;code&gt;Narb&lt;/code&gt;) 
* [[Pahlavi scripts]] (130–133: &lt;code&gt;Prti Phli Phlp Phlv&lt;/code&gt;) – derived from Aramaic.
* [[Avestan alphabet]] (&lt;code&gt;Avst&lt;/code&gt; 134) – from Pahlavi, with added letters. Used for recording the Zoroastrian sacred texts during the Sassanid era. 
* [[Sogdian alphabet|Sogdian]] (no code), and [[Manichaean alphabet|Manichaean]] (&lt;code&gt;Mani&lt;/code&gt; 139, associated with the [[Manichaeism|Manichaean religion]]) – derived from Syriac. Sogdian eventually rotated from RTL to top-to-bottom, giving rise to the Old Uyghur, Mongolian, and Manchu vertical scripts.

'''Scope statements''' can take many forms depending on the type of project being implemented and the nature of the organization. The scope statement details the project deliverables and describes the major objectives. The objectives should include measurable success criteria for the project.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==Overview==
A scope statement should be written before the [[statement of work]] and it should capture, in very broad terms, the product of the project (e.g., ''"developing a software based system to capture and track orders for software"''). A scope statement should also include the list of users using the product, as well as the features in the resulting product.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, David (date unknown). How to Write the Project Statement of Work (SOW). Retrieved on 2010-03-22 from http://www.pmhut.com/how-to-write-the-project-statement-of-work-sow.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
As a baseline scope statements should contain:{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

*The [[project charter]]
*The project owner, [[Executive sponsor|sponsors]], and [[Project stakeholders|stakeholders]]
*The [[problem statement]]
*The project goals and [[project objective|objectives]]
*The project requirements
*The project [[deliverable]]s
*The project non-goals (what is out of scope)
*[[Milestone (project management)|Milestone]]s
*[[Cost estimate]]s

In more project oriented organizations the scope statement could also contain these and other sections:{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

*Project scope management plan
*Approved [[change request]]s
*Project assumptions and risks
*Project acceptance criteria

The [[Project Management Institute|Project Management Institute (PMI)]] defines the project scope statement to include 

*the description of the project scope,
*major deliverables,
*assumptions, and
*constraints.

and is part of the project scope baseline.&lt;ref&gt;A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge, 5th Edition {{ISBN|978-1935589679}}, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Shawnee language''' is a Central [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian language]] spoken in parts of central and northeastern [[Oklahoma]] by the [[Shawnee]] people. It was originally spoken in [[Ohio]], [[West Virginia]], [[Kentucky]], and [[Pennsylvania]]. It is closely related to other Algonquian languages, such as [[Fox language|Mesquakie-Sauk]] ([[Sac and Fox Nation|Sac and Fox]]) and [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]].

== Status ==
Shawnee is severely threatened, with speakers shifting to English. The approximately 200 remaining speakers are older adults.&lt;ref name=e18/&gt; The decline in usage of Shawnee is largely the result of reform schools for Native American children that forced an education in English, causing some Native Americans to cease teaching their languages to children.

Of the 2,000 members of the [[Absentee Shawnee Tribe]] around Shawnee town, more than 100 are speakers; of the 1,500 members of the [[Eastern Shawnee Tribe]] in [[Ottawa County, Oklahoma|Ottawa County]], there are only a few elderly speakers; of the 8,000 members of the [[Loyal Shawnee]] in the [[Cherokee]] region of [[Oklahoma]] around Whiteoak there are fewer than 12 speakers.&lt;ref name="e18"/&gt; All of these low figures, in addition to the fact that most speakers are older adults, make Shawnee an [[endangered language]]. Additionally, development outside of the home is limited; apart from a dictionary and portions of the [[Bible]] from 1842 to 1929,&lt;ref name="e18"/&gt; it appears that there is little literature or technology support for Shawnee.

===Language revitalization===

[[Absentee-Shawnee Tribe of Indians|Absentee-Shawnee]] Elder George Blanchard's Shawnee language classes were profiled on the PBS show "The American Experience" in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode

==Sounds==

Stress in Shawnee falls on the final syllable of a word.

===Vowels===

Shawnee has six vowels&lt;ref&gt;Andrew, Kenneth Ralph. Shawnee Grammar. ProQuest Dissertations and Theses; 1994&lt;/ref&gt;, three of which are high, and three are low.&lt;br&gt;

The Shawnee /θ/ is most often derived from [[Proto-Algonquian]] *s.&lt;ref name="mithun2001"&gt;{{cite book | last = Mithun | first = Marianne | title = The Languages of Native North America | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge | year = 2001 | page = 16 | isbn = 978-0-521-29875-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some speakers of Shawnee pronounce /ʃ/ more like an alveolar [s]. This pronunciation is especially common among [[Loyal Band Shawnee]] speakers near [[Vinita, Oklahoma|Vinita]], Oklahoma.

==Phonology==

;Consonant length: /k/ and /kk/ contrast in the following verbal affixes

ye-kkil-a-ki&lt;br&gt;
SUB-hide-DIR-3sAO&lt;br&gt;
when (I) hide him&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
ye-kkil-a-kki&lt;br&gt;
SUB-hide-DIR-3pAO&lt;br&gt;
when (I) hide them

''These affixes (-ki, -kki) are object markers in the transitive animate subordinate mode. The subject is understood.''

===Phonological rules===

[h]/#____V&lt;br&gt;
A word may not begin with a vowel. Instead, an on-glide [h] is added. For example:&lt;br&gt;
There are two variants of the article "-oci", meaning ''from.'' It can attach to nouns to form prepositional phrases, or it can also be a preverb. When it attaches to a noun, it is "-ooci," and when attached to a preverb it is "-hoci."&lt;br&gt;
'''''example'''''&lt;br&gt;
naamin-ooci&lt;br&gt;
Norman-from&lt;br&gt;
from Norman&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
oklahooma niila hoci-lenawe&lt;br&gt;
Oklahoma 1 from-live&lt;br&gt;
I'm from Oklahoma

==Morphology==

===Morphophonological rules===

====Rule 1====

t/V____V&lt;br&gt;
[t] is inserted between two vowels at morpheme boundary.&lt;br&gt;
As we know from the phonological rule stated above, a word may not begin with a vowel in Shawnee. From the morphophonological rule above, we can assume that [h]~[t].&lt;br&gt;
'''''example'''''&lt;br&gt;
"-eecini(i)" meaning ''Indian agent'' appears as "hina heecini" or ''that Indian agent,'' and as "ho-[t]eecinii-ma-waa-li, meaning ''he was their Indian agent.'' The [t] of "ho-[t]-" fills the open slot that would otherwise have to be filled with [h].

====Rule 2====

V1-V2-----&gt; V2&lt;br&gt;
A short vowel preceding another short vowel at a morpheme boundary is deleted.&lt;br&gt;
'''''example'''''&lt;br&gt;
hina + -ene ( &gt; hinene)&lt;br&gt;
that + -Xtimes&lt;br&gt;
at that time period, then&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
melo'kami -eke ( &gt; melo'kameke)&lt;br&gt;
spring -LOC&lt;br&gt;
in spring

====Rule 3====

V:V------&gt; V:&lt;br&gt;
When a long vowel and a short vowel come together at a morpheme boundary, the short vowel is deleted.&lt;br&gt;
'''''example'''''&lt;br&gt;
ho-staa-ekw-a -li ( &gt; ho-staa-koo-li)&lt;br&gt;
3-build-INV-DIR-3sOBV&lt;br&gt;
he built (him) (a house)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
kaa -ki -noot-en -aa-maa-ekw-a ( &gt; kaakinootenaamaakwa)&lt;br&gt;
REDUP-PERF-hear-by.hand-TI-TA-INV-DIR&lt;br&gt;
(he) signed by hand (to me) (repeatedly)

==Grammar and syntax==

Shawnee shares many grammatical features with other Algonquian languages. There are two third persons, [[Grammatical person#Additional persons|proximate]] and [[obviative]], and two [[noun class]]es (or genders), [[animacy|animate]] and [[animacy|inanimate]]. It is primarily [[agglutination|agglutinating]] [[linguistic typology|typologically]], and is [[polysynthesis|polysynthetic]], resulting in a great deal of information being encoded on the verb. The most common [[word order]] is Verb-Subject.

===Instrumental and transitivizing affixes===

stem-(instrumental affix)-transitivizing affix-object affix &lt;br&gt;
The instrumental affix is not obligatory, but if it is present, it determines the type of transitivizing affix that can follow it, (see numbering scheme below) or by the last stem in the theme. &lt;br&gt;
Instrumental affixes are as follows

&lt;!-- --&gt;

===Modality===
The independent and imperative orders are used in independent clauses. The imperative order involves an understood second person affecting first or third persons. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
teke ki-e' -memekw-i &lt;br&gt;
NEG 2-FUT-run  -IMPER &lt;br&gt;
'you mustn't run' &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
teki-koos-i-ma &lt;br&gt;
NEG run.from-IMPER-AO &lt;br&gt;
'you mustn't run away from him' &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
teke-wi'θen-i kola'-waapaki &lt;br&gt;
NEG eat -IMPER early-morning &lt;br&gt;
'you mustn't eat early in the morning' &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Independent Mode: &lt;br&gt;
Inanimate Intransitive (II): &lt;br&gt;
3s---&gt; /-i/ ---&gt; skwaaw-i 'it is red' &lt;br&gt;
3p---&gt; /-a/ ---&gt; kinwaaw-a 'those are long'

===Demonstrative pronouns===
Refer to the examples below. 'Yaama' meaning 'this' in examples 1 and 2 refers to someone in front of the speaker. The repetition of 'yaama' in example 1 emphasizes the location of the referent in the immediate presence of the speaker. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
(1) yaama-kookwe-nee -θa -yaama &lt;br&gt;
this-strange-appearing-PERSON-this&lt;br&gt;
'this stranger (the one right in front of me)' &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
(2) mata-yaama-ha' -pa-skoolii-wi &lt;br&gt;
not this TIME-go-school- AI &lt;br&gt;
ni-oosθe' -0a &lt;br&gt;
1-grandchild-PERSON &lt;br&gt;
'this grandchild of mine does not go to school' &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Refer to the examples below. 'Hina' functions as a third-person singular pronoun.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
hina-ha'θepati ni-[t]e-si-naa-pe &lt;br&gt;
3 racoon 1 -call-thus-IN.OBJ-1p &lt;br&gt;
'we called him (the Indian Agent) racoon' &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
we ha'θepati -si -θo -hina &lt;br&gt;
now raccoon name-PASSIVE 3 &lt;br&gt;
'then he (the Indian Agent) was named raccoon' &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
howe-si taakteli -hina &lt;br&gt;
good-AI doctor 3 &lt;br&gt;
'he was a good doctor' &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Refer to the examples below. 'Hini' fulfills the same functions as above for inanimate nouns. Locational and third-person singular pronominal uses are found in the following examples. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
na'θaapi ni-[t]aay-a hini &lt;br&gt;
even 1-REDUP-go that &lt;br&gt;
'I would even go there' &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
hini-h-i-si-ci-howe &lt;br&gt;
that [h]-say-thus-3-now &lt;br&gt;
'(when) he said that (to me)'

===Word order===
Shawnee has a fairly free word order, with VSO being the most common: &lt;br&gt;
teki koos -i -ma &lt;br&gt;
NEG run.from-IMPER-AO &lt;br&gt;
'run you from him' (in the negative) &lt;br&gt;
'you mustn't run away from him' &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
SOV, SVO, VOS, and OVS are also plausible.

====Grammatical categories====
Parts of speech in the Algonquian languages, Shawnee included, show a basic division between inflecting forms (nouns, verbs and pronouns), and non-inflecting invariant forms (also known as particles). Directional particles ("piyeci" meaning "towards") incorporate into the verb itself. Although particles are invariant in form, they have different distributions and meanings that correspond to adverbs ("[hi]noki" meaning "now", "waapaki" meaning "today", "lakokwe" meaning "so, certainly", "mata" meaning "not") postpositions ("heta'koθaki wayeeci" meaning "towards the east") and interjections ("ce" meaning "so!").

===Case===
Examples (1) and (2) below show the grammatical interaction of obviation and inverse. The narrative begins in (1) in which grandfather is the grammatical subject [+AGENT] in discourse-focus [+PROXIMATE]. In (2), grandfather remains in discourse-focus [+PROXIMATE], but he is now the grammatical object [+OBJECT]. To align grammatical relations properly in (2), the inverse marker /-ekw-/ is used in the verb stem to signal that the governor is affecting grandfather. (The prefix /ho-/ on 'ho-stakooli' refers to grandfather).

(1) he-meci -naat-aw'ky-aa-ci hina ni-me'soom' -θa &lt;br&gt;
SUB-COMPLETED-much-land -TA-3SUB that 1-grandfather-PERSON&lt;br&gt;
'afterwards my grandfather received land' &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
(2) wiikiwa ho-staa -ekw-a -li kapenalee-li&lt;br&gt;
house 3-build-INV-DIR-3sOBV governor -3sOBV&lt;br&gt;
'the governor built (him) a house' &lt;br&gt;
(/-li/ is the obviative marker)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Since the person building the house (the governor) is disjoint from the person who the house is being built for (the grandfather), this disjunction is marked by placing one participant in the obviative. Since grandfather is the focus in this narrative, the governor is assigned the obviative marking. Grammatically, 'kapenal-ee' (-ee- &lt; -ile- &lt; -ileni- 'person') is the subject who is not in discourse-focus (marked by /-li/ 3sOBVIATIVE), showing that grammatical relations and obviation are independent categories. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Similar interactions of inverse and obviation are found below. In Shawnee, third person animate beings participate in obviation, including grammatically animate nouns that are semantically inanimate. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
we ni-cis-h -ekw-a hina weepikwa &lt;br&gt;
then 1-fear-CAUSE-INV-DIR- that spider &lt;br&gt;
'then that spider scared me' &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
ho-waap-am-aa-li kisa'θwa-li &lt;br&gt;
3-look -TA-DIR-3sOBV- sun -3sOBV &lt;br&gt;
'he looked at the sun'

====Locative affix /-eki/====
The Shawnee /-eki/ meaning "in" can be used with either gender. This locative affix cliticizes onto the preceding noun, and thus it appears to be a case ending. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
tekwakhwikan-eki&lt;br&gt;
box -in &lt;br&gt;
'in a box' &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
msi-wikiwaap-eki &lt;br&gt;
big-house -in &lt;br&gt;
'in a big house' &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
tθene melo'kami-eki &lt;br&gt;
every spring -in &lt;br&gt;
'every spring'

==Person, number, and gender==

===Gender===

The basic distinction for gender in Shawnee is between animate actors and inanimate objects.&lt;br&gt;
: Nouns are in two gender classes, inanimate and animate; the latter includes all persons, animals, spirits, and large trees, and some other objects such as tobacco, maize, apple, raspberry (but not strawberry), calf of leg (but not thigh), stomach, spittle, feather, bird's tail, horn, kettle, pipe for smoking, snowshoe.&lt;ref&gt;Bloomfield 1946:449-50; punctuation as in the original&lt;/ref&gt;

Grammatical gender in Shawnee is more accurately signaled by the ''phonology'', not the semantics.&lt;br&gt;
Nouns ending in /-a/ are animate, while nouns ending in /-i/ are inanimate.&lt;ref&gt;Chrisley 1992:9&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted that this phonological criterion is not absolute. Modification by a demonstrative ("hina" being animate and "hini" being inanimate, meaning ''that'') and pluralization are conclusive tests.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In the singular, Shawnee animate nouns end in /-a/, and the obviative singular morpheme is /-li/.&lt;br&gt;
Shawnee inanimate nouns are usually pluralized with stem +/-ali/. &lt;br&gt;
This causes '''animate obviative singular''' and '''inanimate plural''' to look alike on the surface.&lt;br&gt;
'''''example'''''&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
animate obviative singular&lt;br&gt;
wiskilo'θa-'''li'''&lt;br&gt;
bird&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
inanimate plural&lt;br&gt;
niipit-'''ali'''&lt;br&gt;
my teeth

===Number===

: Shawnee nouns can be singular or plural. Inflectional affixes in the verb stem that cross-reference objects are often omitted if inanimate objects are involved. Even if an inflectional affix for the inanimate object is present, it usually does not distinguish number. For example, in the TI paradigm (animate›inanimate) when there is a second or third person plural subject, object markers are present in the verb stem, but they are number-indifferent. Overt object markers are omitted for most other subjects. In the inverse situation, (animate‹inanimate) the inanimate participants are not cross-referenced morphologically.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew, Kenneth Ralph. ProQuest Dissertations and Theses; 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Person===

The choice of person affix may depend on the relative position of agent and object on the animacy hierarchy. According to Dixon &lt;ref&gt;Dixon 1979:85-6&lt;/ref&gt; the animacy hierarchy extends from first person pronoun, second person pronoun, third person pronoun, proper nouns, human common nouns, animate common nouns, and inanimate common nouns.

The affixes in the verb will reflect whether an animate agent is acting on someone or something lower in the animacy scale, or whether he is being acted upon by someone or something lower in the animacy scale.

==Orthography==

During the 19th century a short-lived Roman-based alphabet was designed for Shawnee by the missionary [[Jotham Meeker]]. It was never widely used.&lt;ref name="mithun2001"&gt;{{cite book | last = Mithun | first = Marianne | title = The Languages of Native North America | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge | year = 2001 | page = 36 | isbn = 978-0-521-29875-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, native Shawnee speaker [[Thomas 'Wildcat' Alford]] devised a highly phonemic and accurate orthography for his 1929 Shawnee translation of the four gospels of the New Testament, but it, too, never attained wide usage.

'''Sheko''' is an [[Omotic]] language of the [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] language family spoken in the area between [[Tepi]] and [[Mizan Teferi]] in western [[Ethiopia]], in the [[Sheko (woreda)|Sheko]] district in the [[Bench Maji Zone]]. The 2007 census lists 38,911 speakers; the 1998 census listed 23,785 speakers, with 13,611 identified as  monolinguals.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond G. Gordon Jr., ed. 2005. ''Ethnologue:  Languages of the World''. 15th edition. Dallas: Summer Institute of Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt;

The language is notable for its [[retroflex consonant]]s (Aklilu Yilma 1988), a striking feature shared with closely related [[Dizi language|Dizi]] and nearby (but not closely related) [[Bench language|Bench]] (Breeze 1988).  The Ethnologue lists the following linguistic features: "SOV; postpositions; genitives, articles, adjectives, numerals, relatives after noun heads; question word initial; 1 prefix, 5 suffixes; word order distinguishes subjects, objects, indirect objects; affixes indicate case of noun phrases; verb affixes mark person, number, gender of subject; passives, causatives, comparatives; CV, CVC, CVV, CV:C, CVCC; tonal, 3 tones."

Sheko, together with the [[Dizi language|Dizi]] and [[Nayi language]]s, is part of a cluster of languages variously called "Maji" or "[[Dizoid languages|Dizoid]]".

The '''Southeast Papuan''', '''Papuan Peninsula''' or '''"Bird's Tail"''' languages are a group of half a dozen small [[language family|families]] of [[Papuan languages]] in the "[[Bird's Tail]]" (southeastern peninsula) of New Guinea that are part of the [[Trans–New Guinea languages|Trans–New Guinea]] (TNG) phylum.

==Languages==
The languages are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;https://sites.google.com/site/newguineaworld/families/trans-new-guinea/papuan-peninsula&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 her first short novel ''Green Margarita'' ({{lang-uk|Зелена Маргарита|italic=yes}}) was awarded 2nd place in a Smoloskyp publishers contest for young writers. Subsequently it was published by Smoloskyp in 2000 and has since been republished twice (2002, 2007) by two different publishers.

In 2000 she became editor-in-chief of a TV talk show ''Without Taboo'' ({{lang-uk|Без табу|italic=yes}}) at the Ukrainian [[1+1 (channel)|1+1]] TV channel, dedicated to unusual human stories, with elements of dramatisation.

In 2002, together with colleagues T. Vorozhko and M. Veresen, she published a book describing their TV experience, ''Without Taboo about "Without Taboo"'' ({{lang-uk|Без табу про "Без Табу"|italic=yes}}) with “Zeleny Pes” publishers.

In 2004 Svitlana Pyrkalo's second novel, ''Don’t Think About Red'' ({{lang-uk|Не думай про червоне|italic=yes}}), was published by Fakt publishers, Kyіv.

In 2007 Fakt also published her collection of essays on food, travel and Ukrainian identity ''Egoist's Kitchen'' ({{lang-uk|Кухня Егоїста|italic=yes}}). In 2007 Svitlana Pyrkalo also translated into Ukrainian the novel ''Two Caravans'' by [[Marina Lewycka]].

From 2007 to 2009 Svitlana Pyrkalo wrote a weekly column in the Ukrainian-language magazine ''Glavred'' ({{lang-uk|Главред|italic=yes}}).

In 2006-2010 she wrote a weekly column for the Ukrainian newspaper, ''Gazeta po-ukrainsky'' ({{lang-uk|Газета по-українськи|italic=yes}}). In 2007 these collected articles, together with 3 other authors, were published as a book by Nora-druk publishers, Kyіv.

'''Sylheti''' ([[Sylheti Nagari|Sylheti]]: ꠍꠤꠟꠐꠤ, {{lang-bn|সিলেটি}}) is an [[Indo-Aryan languages#Eastern Zone .28Magadhan.29|Indo-Aryan language]], primarily spoken in the [[Sylhet region]] of [[Bangladesh]] and in the [[Barak Valley]] of the [[States and union territories of India|Indian state]] of [[Assam]]. There are substantial number of speakers in the Indian states of [[Meghalaya]], [[Tripura]] and [[Manipur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/language/syl |title=Sylheti |publisher=[[Ethnologue]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; A significant amount of Sylheti migration to the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] from the 20th century has made Sylheti one of the most spoken language or variety of the [[Bangladeshi diaspora]].

==Status==
The status of Sylheti is hotly disputed with some considering it a dialect of [[Bengali language|Bengali]], while others consider it a separate language.&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian M. Rasinger (2007). ''Bengali-English in East London: A Study in Urban Multilingualism''. pp.F 26-27. Retrieved on 2017-05-02.&lt;/ref&gt; There are significant differences in grammar and pronunciation as well as a lack of [[mutual intelligibility]] between the two varieties. There are greater differences between Sylheti and Bengali than between Sylheti and [[Assamese language|Assamese]], which is recognised as a separate language.&lt;ref&gt;Glanville Price (2000). ''Encyclopedia of the Languages of Europe''. pp. 91-92.&lt;/ref&gt; Most [[Sylhetis]] are at least bilingual to some degree, as Bengali is taught at all levels of education in Bangladesh. Sylhet was part of the ancient kingdom of [[Kamarupa]],&lt;ref&gt;Edward Gait, History of Assam, p. 274''&lt;/ref&gt; and Sylheti shares many common features with [[Assamese language|Assamese]], including having a larger set of [[fricative]]s than other Eastern [[Indo-Aryan languages]]. According to [[George Abraham Grierson]],&lt;ref&gt;George Grierson, Language Survey of India, Vol II, Pt 1, p224&lt;/ref&gt; "The inflections also differ from those of regular Bengali, and in one or two instances assimilate to those of Assamese". Considering the unique linguistic properties such as phoneme inventory, allophony, and inflectional morphology in particular and lexicon in general, Sylheti is often regarded as a separate language (Grierson 1928, Chatterjee 1939, Gordon 2005). Indeed, it was formerly written using its own script, [[Sylheti Nagari]], which, although largely replaced with the [[Bengali script]] in recent times, is beginning to experience a revival in use. 

Sylheti shares at least 80% of its lexicon with Bengali.&lt;ref&gt;Chalmers (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name of the language==
Sylheti is the common [[English spelling]] of the language name after the accepted British spelling of the [[Sylhet District]]. The Standard Bengali spelling of the name Sylheti is {{lang|bn|সিলেটি}} ({{lang|bn-Latn|Sileṭi}}). The Sylheti spelling is {{lang|syl|ꠍꠤꠟꠐꠤ}} or {{lang|syl|ছিলটি}} ({{lang|syl-Latn|Silôṭi}}).

==History==
[[File:Halot-un-nabi-page1.gif|thumb|right|420px|SAMPLE TEXT: &lt;br/&gt;Front page of a [[Sylheti Nagari|Nagari]] book titled [[Halat-un-Nabi]], written in the mid-19th century by [[Sadeq Ali]] of [[Sylhet]] ]]

In ancient literature, Sylhet was referred as ''Shilahat'' and ''Shilahatta''.&lt;ref&gt;James Lloyd-Williams &amp; Sue Lloyd-Williams (Sylheti Translation and Research/STAR); Peter Constable (SIL International) Date: 1 November 2002&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, the British tea-planters in the area referred to the vernacular spoken in Surma and Barak Valleys as Sylheti language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Linguistic Survey of India|5|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Assam]], the language is still referred to as ''Sylheti''.

During the British colonial period, a Sylheti student by the name of Munshi Abdul Karim studying in London, England, after completing his education, spent several years in London and learned the printing trade. After returning home, he designed a woodblock type for Sylheti Nagari and founded the Islamia Press in [[Sylhet]] Town in about 1870. Other Sylheti presses were established in [[Sunamganj]], [[Shillong]] and [[Kolkata]]. These presses fell out of use during the early 1970s.&lt;ref name="Banglapedia"&gt;[http://www.ebanglapedia.com/en/article.php?id=2880#.U7uPZly9LCQ Banglapedia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Archive"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/lifeofmaulaviabd031133mbp/lifeofmaulaviabd031133mbp_djvu.txt Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the Sylotinagri alphabet has been used mainly by linguists and academics.&lt;ref name="sylhetialphabets"&gt;[http://www.omniglot.com/writing/syloti.htm Sylheti Alphabets]&lt;/ref&gt; It gradually became very unpopular.&lt;ref name="omniglot"&gt;[http://www.omniglot.com/writing/syloti.htm Syloti Nagri alphabet]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/UA800.pdf Sylheti unicode chart]&lt;/ref&gt;

The script includes 5 independent vowels, 5 dependent vowels attached to a consonant letter and 27 consonants. The Sylheti [[abugida]] differs from the [[Bengali alphabet]] as it is a form of [[Kaithi]], a script that belongs to the main group of [[Brahmic scripts|North Indian scripts]] of [[Bihar]].&lt;ref name="sylhetilanguage"&gt;[http://www.sylheti.org.uk/page2.html Sylheti Literature]&lt;/ref&gt; The writing system's main use was to record religious poetry, described as a rich language and easy to learn.&lt;ref name="sylhetiliterature"&gt;[http://www.sylheti.org.uk/egalip13.html Sylheti Literature]&lt;/ref&gt;

Campaigns started to rise in London during the mid-1970s to mid-1980s to recognise Sylheti as a language in its own right. During the mid-1970s, when the first mother-tongue classes were established for Bangladeshis by community activists, the classes were given in standard Bengali rather than the Sylheti dialect which triggered the campaign. During the 1980s, a [[Recognition (sociology)|recognition]] campaign for Sylheti took place in the area of [[Spitalfields]], [[East End of London]]. One of the main organisations was the Bangladeshis' Educational Needs in Tower Hamlets (usually known by its acronym as BENTH). However this organisation collapsed in 1985 and with its demise, the pro-Sylheti campaign in the borough lost impetus. Nonetheless, Sylheti remains very widespread as a [[Home|domestic]] language in working-class as well as upper-class Sylheti households in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Anne J. Kershen |year=2005 |title=Strangers, Aliens and Asians: Huguenots, Jews and Bangladeshis in Spitalfields, 1660–2000 |publisher=Routledge |pages=148–150 |isbn=978-0-7146-5525-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sylheti variation from Standard Bengali==

===Vocabulary look===

A phrase in:
*Standard Bengali: {{lang|bn|এক দেশের গালি আরেক দেশের বুলি}} ''æk desher gali arek desher buli''.
*Sylheti: {{lang|syl|ꠄꠇ ꠖꠦꠡꠞ ꠉꠣꠁꠟ ꠀꠣꠞꠇ ꠖꠦꠡꠞ ꠝꠣꠔ/এক দেশর গাইল, আরক দেশর মাত}} ''ex deshôr gail arôx deshôr mat''.

which literally means "one land's obscenity is another land's language", and can be roughly translated to convey that a similar word in one language can mean something very different in another. For example:

''' মেঘ ''megh'' in Standard Bengali means ''cloud'' '''.
:ꠝꠦꠊ/মেঘ ''megh'' in Sylheti means ''rain''.
:In Pali মেঘ ''megh'' means both ''rain'' and ''cloud''.
:In Sylheti ''cloud'' is called ꠛꠣꠖꠟ/বাদল ''badôl'', ꠢꠣꠎ/হাজ ''haz'', or ꠀꠡꠝꠣꠘꠤ ꠢꠣꠎ/আসমানি হাজ ''ashmani haz'' ''(decor of the sky)''.
:In Standard Bengali ''rain'' is called বৃষ্টি ''brishti''.

''' নাড়া ''naṛa'' in Standard Bengali means ''to stir'' or ''to move'' '''.
:In Sylheti, ''to stir'' is called ''laṛa'' (ꠟꠣꠠꠣ).

''' কম্বল ''kômbôl'' in Standard Bengali means ''blanket''.
:In Sylheti, ''blanket'' is called ꠞꠣꠎꠣꠁ/রাজাই ''razai''.
:ꠇꠝꠛꠟ/কম্বল ''xômbôl'' in Sylheti means ''buttock''.

==Tone==
Sylheti is a [[Tone (linguistics)|tonal language]]. The [[Indo-Aryan languages]] are not generally recognized for tone. There are two way tonal contrasts in Sylheti: the emergence of high tone in the vowels following the loss of aspiration, and a low tone elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278021499 | title=Lexical Tones in Sylheti | last1= Gope | first1 = Amalesh | last2 = Mahanta | first2 = Shakun | date=May 2014 | work=ResearchGate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''bát'' (ꠜꠣꠔ) 'rice'
Sylheti continues to have a long history of coexisting with other [[Tibeto-Burman languages]] such as various dialects of [[Kokborok]], [[Reang]] which are tonal in nature. Even though there is no clear evidence of direct borrowing of lexical items from those tonal languages into Sylheti, there is still a possibility that the emergence of Sylheti tones is due to an areal feature as the indigenous speakers of Tibeto-Burman languages by and large use Sylheti as a common medium for interaction.

==Phonology==
Sylheti is distinguished by its tonal characteristics and a wide range of [[fricative consonant]]s corresponding to [[aspirated consonant]]s in closely related languages and dialects such as Bengali; a lack of the [[breathy voice]]d stops; word-final stress; and a relatively large set of [[loanword]]s from [[Assamese language|Assamese]], [[Bengali language|Standard Bengali]] and other [[Bengali dialects]]. Sylheti has affected the course of Standard Bengali in the rest of the state.

A notable characteristic of spoken Sylheti is the correspondence of the {{IPA|/ʜ/}} (hereafter transliterated x), pronounced as an [[Voiceless epiglottal fricative]] to the {{IPAblink|ʃ}}, or "sh", of Bengali, e.g.

'''Telepathy''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] τῆλε, ''tele'' meaning "distant" and πάθος, ''pathos'' or ''-patheia'' meaning "[[feeling]], [[perception]], [[Passion (emotion)|passion]], [[Suffering|affliction]], [[experience]]")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/telepathy Telepathy].

Telepathy experiments have historically been criticized for lack of proper controls and repeatability. There is no convincing evidence that telepathy exists, and the topic is generally considered by the [[scientific community]] to be [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref name="Planer1980"&gt;Felix Planer. (1980). ''Superstition''. Cassell. p. 218. {{ISBN|0-304-30691-6}} "Many experiments have attempted to bring scientific methods to bear on the investigation of the subject. Their results based on literally millions of tests, have made it abundantly clear that there exists no such phenomenon as telepathy, and that the seemingly successful scores have relied either on illusion, or on deception."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dalkvist1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jan Dalkvist|title=Telepathic Group Communication of Emotions as a Function of Belief in Telepathy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lhsRAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=5 October 2011|year=1994|publisher=Dept. of Psychology, Stockholm University|quote=Within the scientific community however, the claim that psi anomalies exist or may exist is in general regarded with skepticism. One reason for this difference between the scientist and the non scientist is that the former relies on his own experiences and anecdotal reports of psi phenomena, whereas the scientist at least officially requires replicable results from well controlled experiments to believe in such phenomena - results which according to the prevailing view among scientists, do not exist.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Drees1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Willem B.

Cengage Learning. p. 143. {{ISBN|978-1111344856}} "There is no adequate scientific evidence that people can read other people's minds. Research has not identified one single indisputable telepath or clairvoyant."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the concept==
According to historians such as [[Roger Luckhurst]] and [[Janet Oppenheim]] the origin of the concept of telepathy in [[Western civilization]] can be tracked to the late 19th century and the formation of the [[Society for Psychical Research]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Janet Oppenheim|Oppenheim, Janet]]. (1985). ''The Other World: Spiritualism and Psychical Research in England, 1850-1914''. Cambridge University Press. pp. 135-249. {{ISBN|978-0521265058}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Luckhurst2002"&gt;[[Roger Luckhurst|Luckhurst, Roger]]. (2002). ''The Invention of Telepathy, 1870-1901''. Oxford University Press. pp. 9-51. {{ISBN|978-0199249626}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the physical sciences made significant advances, scientific concepts were applied to mental phenomena (e.g., [[animal magnetism]]), with the hope that this would help to understand [[paranormal]] phenomena. The modern concept of telepathy emerged in this context.&lt;ref name="Luckhurst2002"/&gt;

Psychical researcher [[Eric Dingwall]] criticized SPR founding members [[Frederic William Henry Myers|Frederic W. H. Myers]] and [[William F. Barrett]] for trying to "prove" telepathy rather than objectively analyze whether or not it existed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Dingwall|Dingwall, Eric]]. (1985). ''The Need for Responsibility in Parapsychology: My Sixty Years in Psychical Research''. In ''A Skeptic's Handbook of Parapsychology''. Prometheus Books. pp. 161-174. {{ISBN|0-87975-300-5}} "Let me give an example, such as thought-transference, which is as good as any. When the British SPR was founded, the public was led to believe that at least a scientific survey was to be made, and I have no doubt that even some of those closely associated with the early days thought so too. But Myers, among others, had no such intention and cherished no such illusion. He knew that the primary aim of the Society was not objective experimentation but the establishment of telepathy. (...) What was wanted was proof that mind could communicate with mind apart from the normal avenues, for if mental sharing was a fact when the persons concerned were incarnate it could plausibly be suggested that the same mechanism might operate when death had occurred. Thus the supernatural might be proved by science, and psychical research might become, in the words of Sir William Barrett, a handmaid to religion."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thought reading==
In the late 19th century, the magician and mentalist, [[Washington Irving Bishop]] would perform "thought reading" demonstrations. Bishop claimed no [[supernatural]] powers and ascribed his powers to [[Muscle reading|muscular sensitivity]] (reading thoughts from unconscious bodily cues).&lt;ref&gt;Roger Luckhurst. (2002). ''The Invention of Telepathy: 1870-1901''. Oxford University Press. p. 63. {{ISBN|978-0199249626}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bishop was investigated by a group of scientists including the editor of the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' and the psychologist [[Francis Galton]]. Bishop performed several feats successfully such as correctly identifying a selected spot on a table and locating a hidden object. During the experiment Bishop required physical contact with a subject who knew the correct answer.  He would hold the hand or wrist of the helper. The scientists concluded that Bishop was not a genuine telepath but using a highly trained skill to detect [[Ideomotor phenomenon|ideomotor movements]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Wiseman]]. (2011). ''Paranormality: Why We See What Isn't There''. Macmillan. p. 140-142. {{ISBN|978-0-230-75298-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another famous thought reader was the magician [[Stuart Cumberland]]. He was famous for performing [[blindfold]]ed feats such as identifying a hidden object in a room that a person had picked out or asking someone to imagine a murder scene and then attempt to read the subject's thoughts and identify the victim and reenact the crime. Cumberland claimed to possess no genuine psychic ability and his thought reading performances could only be demonstrated by holding the hand of his subject to read their muscular movements. He came into dispute with psychical researchers associated with the [[Society for Psychical Research]] who were searching for genuine cases of telepathy. Cumberland argued that both telepathy and communication with the dead were impossible and that the mind of man cannot be read through telepathy, but only by [[muscle reading]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicola Bown, Carolyn Burdett, Pamela Thurschwell. (2004). ''The Victorian Supernatural''. Cambridge University Press. pp. 87-108. {{ISBN|0-521-81015-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case studies==
[[File:Gilbert Murray.jpg|thumb|[[Gilbert Murray]] conducted early telepathy experiments.]]

In the late 19th century the Creery Sisters (Mary, Alice, Maud, Kathleen, and Emily) were tested by the [[Society for Psychical Research]] and believed to have genuine psychic ability. However, during a later experiment they were caught utilizing signal codes and they confessed to fraud.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ray Hyman]]. (1989). ''The Elusive Quarry: A Scientific Appraisal of Psychical Research''. Prometheus Books. pp. 99-106&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gordon Stein]]. (1996). ''The Encyclopedia of the Paranormal''. Prometheus Books. p. 688&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Albert Smith (film pioneer)|George Albert Smith]] and [[Douglas Blackburn]] were claimed to be genuine psychics by the Society for Psychical Research but Blackburn confessed to fraud:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For nearly thirty years the telepathic experiments conducted by Mr. G. A. Smith and myself have been accepted and cited as the basic evidence of the truth of thought transference...

...the whole of those alleged experiments were bogus, and originated in the honest desire of two youths to show how easily men of scientific mind and training could be deceived when seeking for evidence in support of a theory they were wishful to establish.&lt;ref&gt;Neher, Andrew. (2011). ''Paranormal and Transcendental Experience: A Psychological Examination''. Dover Publications. p. 220. {{ISBN|0-486-26167-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Between 1916 and 1924, [[Gilbert Murray]] conducted 236 experiments into telepathy and reported 36% as successful, however, it was suggested that the results could be explained by [[hyperaesthesia]] as he could hear what was being said by the sender.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, Kenneth Wilcox. (1928). ''Is Telepathy all Bunk?'' ''[[Popular Science Monthly]]''. p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Couttie, Bob. (1988). ''Forbidden Knowledge: The Paranormal Paradox''. Lutterworth Press. p. 129. {{ISBN|978-0-7188-2686-4}} "In the early 1900s Gilbert Murray, who died in 1957, carried out some experiments in ESP in which he was in one room and the sender in a hallway, often with an open door between them. These experiments were successful. Most of the time the target was spoken aloud. When it was not, there were negative results. This is suggestive of a hyperacuity of hearing, especially since on at least one occasion Murray complained about noise coming from a milk-cart in the street next to the one in which the experiments were being carried out."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mauskopf, Seymour H; McVaugh, Michael Rogers. (1980). ''The Elusive Science: Origins of Experimental Psychical Research''. Johns Hopkins University Press. p. 331. {{ISBN|978-0801823312}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Leonard Zusne|Zusne, Leonard]]; Jones, Warren H. (1989).

''Psychics, Sensitives and Somnambules: A Biographical Dictionary with Bibliographies''. McFarland. p. 126. {{ISBN|0-7864-2770-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist [[Leonard T. Troland]] had carried out experiments in telepathy at [[Harvard University]] which were reported in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;[[Milbourne Christopher|Christopher, Milbourne]]. (1971).

State History Publications. p. 526. {{ISBN|1-878592-72-6}} "On his return to Harvard in 1916, one of his first enterprises was an investigation of telepathy in the psychology laboratory, which gave negative results."&lt;/ref&gt; The subjects produced below chance expectations.&lt;ref&gt;Asprem, Egil.

[[Arthur Conan Doyle]] and [[William Thomas Stead|W. T. Stead]] were duped into believing [[Julius and Agnes Zancig]] had genuine psychic powers. Both Doyle and Stead wrote the Zancigs performed telepathy. In 1924, Julius and Agnes Zancig confessed that their [[Mentalism|mind reading]] act was a trick and published the secret code and all the details of the trick method they had used under the title of ''Our Secrets!!'' in a London newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Booth (magician)|John Booth]]. (1986). ''Psychic Paradoxes''. Prometheus Books. p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, Robert H. Gault of [[Northwestern University]] with [[Gardner Murphy]] conducted the first American radio test for telepathy. The results were entirely negative. One of their experiments involved the attempted thought transmission of a chosen number, out of 2010 replies none were correct.&lt;ref&gt;Gault, Robert H. (August, 1924). ''Telepathy Put to the Test''. ''[[Popular Science]]''. pp. 114-115&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1927, with the co-operation of the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] (BBC), [[V. J. Woolley]] who was at the time the Research Officer for the SPR, arranged a telepathy experiment in which radio listeners were asked to take part. The experiment involved 'agents' thinking about five selected objects in an office at [[Tavistock Square]], whilst listeners on the radio were asked to identify the objects from the BBC studio at [[Savoy Hill]]. 24, 659 answers were received. The results revealed no evidence for telepathy.&lt;ref&gt;Mauskopf, Seymour H; McVaugh, Michael Rogers. (1980). ''The Elusive Science: Origins of Experimental Psychical Research''. Johns Hopkins University Press. pp. 36-38. {{ISBN|978-0801823312}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Simeon Edmunds|Edmunds, Simeon]]. (1965). ''Miracles of the Mind: An Introduction to Parapsychology''. C. C. Thomas. pp. 26-28&lt;/ref&gt;

A famous experiment in telepathy was recorded by the American author [[Upton Sinclair]] in his book ''[[Mental Radio]]'' which documents Sinclair's test of psychic abilities of [[Mary Craig Sinclair]], his second wife. She attempted to duplicate 290 pictures which were drawn by her husband.  Sinclair claimed Mary successfully duplicated 65 of them, with 155 "partial successes" and 70 failures. However, these experiments were not conducted in a controlled scientific laboratory environment.&lt;ref name="Gardner1957"&gt;[[Martin Gardner]], ''[[Fads &amp; Fallacies in the Name of Science]]'' (Courier Dover Publications, 1957) Chapter 25: ''ESP and PK'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=TwP3SGAUsnkC&amp; available online]; accessed July 25, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Science writer [[Martin Gardner]] suggested that the possibility of [[sensory leakage]] during the experiment had not been ruled out:

{{quote|In the first place, an intuitive wife, who knows her husband intimately, may be able to guess with a fair degree of accuracy what he is likely to draw—particularly if the picture is related to some freshly recalled event the two experienced in common. At first, simple pictures like chairs and tables would likely predominate, but as these are exhausted, the field of choice narrows and pictures are more likely to be suggested by recent experiences. It is also possible that Sinclair may have given conversational hints during some of the tests—hints which in his strong will to believe, he would promptly forget about. Also, one must not rule out the possibility that in many tests, made across the width of a room, Mrs. Sinclair may have seen the wiggling of the top of a pencil, or arm movements, which would convey to her unconscious a rough notion of the drawing.&lt;ref name="Gardner1957"/&gt;}}

The Turner-Ownbey long distance telepathy experiment was discovered to contain flaws. May Frances Turner positioned herself in the Duke Parapsychology Laboratory whilst Sara Ownbey claimed to receive transmissions 250 miles away. For the experiment Turner would think of a symbol and write it down whilst Ownbey would write her guesses.&lt;ref name="Sladek 1974"&gt;[[John Thomas Sladek|John Sladek]]. (1974). The New Apocrypha: A Guide to Strange Sciences and Occult Beliefs. Panther. pp. 172-174&lt;/ref&gt; The scores were highly successful and both records were supposed to be sent to [[J. B. Rhine]]; however, Ownbey sent them to Turner. Critics pointed out this invalidated the results as she could have simply written her own record to agree with the other. When the experiment was repeated and the records were sent to Rhine the scores dropped to average.&lt;ref name="Sladek 1974"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bergen Evans]]. (1954). ''The Spoor of Spooks: And Other Nonsense''. Knopf. p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[C. E. M. Hansel]]. (1989). ''The Search for Psychic Power: ESP and Parapsychology Revisited''. Prometheus Books. pp. 56-58. {{ISBN|0-87975-516-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is the experiment carried out by the author [[Harold Sherman]] with the explorer [[Hubert Wilkins]] who carried out their own experiment in telepathy for five and a half months starting in October 1937. This took place when Sherman was in [[New York (state)|New York]] and Wilkins was in the [[Arctic]]. The experiment consisted of Sherman and Wilkins at the end of each day to relax and visualise a mental image or "thought impression" of the events or thoughts they had experienced in the day and then to record those images and thoughts on paper in a diary. The results at the end when comparing Sherman's and Wilkins' diaries were claimed to be more than 60 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Nasht. (2006). ''The Last Explorer: Hubert Wilkins, Hero of the Great Age of Polar Exploration''. Arcade Publishing. pp. 267-268&lt;/ref&gt;

The full results of the experiments were published in 1942 in a book by Sherman and Wilkins titled ''Thoughts Through Space''. In the book both Sherman and Wilkins had written they believed they had demonstrated that it was possible to send and receive thought impressions from the mind of one person to another.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hubert Wilkins]], [[Harold Sherman]]. (2004). ''Thoughts through Space: A Remarkable Adventure in the Realm of Mind''. Hampton Roads Publishing. {{ISBN|1-57174-314-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magician [[John Booth (magician)|John Booth]] wrote the experiment was not an example of telepathy as a high percentage of misses had occurred. Booth wrote it was more likely that the "hits" were the result of "coincidence, law of averages, subconscious expectancy, logical inference or a plain lucky guess".&lt;ref&gt;[[John Booth (magician)|John Booth]]. (1986). ''Psychic Paradoxes''. Prometheus Books. p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; A review of their book in the ''[[American Journal of Orthopsychiatry]]'' cast doubt on their experiment noting "the study was published five years after it was conducted, arouses suspicion on the validity of the conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, Lee R. (1942). ''Review of Thoughts Through Space''. ''[[American Journal of Orthopsychiatry]]'' 12 (4): 745.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, on the BBC radio [[Maurice Fogel]] made the claim that he could demonstrate telepathy. This intrigued the journalist Arthur Helliwell who wanted to discover his methods. He found that Fogel's mind reading acts were all based on trickery, he relied on information about members of his audience before the show started. Helliwell exposed Fogel's methods in a newspaper article. Although Fogel managed to fool some people into believing he could perform genuine telepathy, the majority of his audience knew he was a showman.&lt;ref name="Lamont 2013"&gt;[[Peter Lamont (historian)|Lamont, Peter]]. (2013). ''Extraordinary Beliefs: A Historical Approach to a Psychological Problem''. Cambridge University Press. p. 220. {{ISBN|978-1-107-01933-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a series of experiments [[Samuel Soal]] and his assistant [[K. M. Goldney]] examined 160 subjects over 128,000 trials and obtained no evidence for the existence of telepathy.&lt;ref name="Reznek 2010"&gt;Lawrie Reznek. (2010). ''Delusions and the Madness of the Masses''. Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers . pp. 54-55&lt;/ref&gt; Soal tested Basil Shackleton and Gloria Stewart between 1941 and 1943 in over five hundred sittings and over twenty thousand guesses. Shackleton scored 2890 compared with a chance expectation of 2308 and Gloria scored 9410 compared with a chance level of 7420. It was later discovered the results had been tampered with. Gretl Albert who was present during many of the experiments said she had witnessed Soal altering the records during the sessions.&lt;ref name="Reznek 2010"/&gt; Betty Marwick discovered Soal had not used the method of random selection of numbers as he had claimed. Marwick showed that there had been manipulation of the score sheets "all the experiments reported by Soal had thereby been discredited."&lt;ref&gt;[[C. E. M. Hansel]]. (1980). ''ESP and Parapsychology: A Critical Reevaluation''. Prometheus Books. p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Betty Markwick. (1985). ''The establishment of data manipulation in the Soal-Shackleton experiments''. In [[Paul Kurtz]]. ''A Skeptic’s Handbook of Parapsychology''. Prometheus Books. pp. 287-312&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979 the physicists [[John G. Taylor]] and Eduardo Balanovski wrote the only scientifically feasible explanation for telepathy could be electromagnetism (EM) involving [[Electromagnetic field|EM fields]]. In a series of experiments the EM levels were many orders of magnitude lower than calculated and no paranormal effects were observed. Both Taylor and Balanovski wrote their results were a strong argument against the validity of telepathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Taylor | first1 = J.

Research in [[anomalistic psychology]] has discovered that in some cases telepathy can be explained by a [[Covariance|covariation bias]]. In an experiment (Schienle ''et al''. 1996) 22 believers and 20 skeptics were asked to judge the covariation between transmitted symbols and the corresponding feedback given by a receiver. According to the results the believers overestimated the number of successful transmissions whilst the skeptics made accurate hit judgments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schienle | first1 = A. | last2 = Vaitl | first2 = D. | last3 = Stark | first3 = R. | year = 1996 | title = Covariation bias and paranormal belief | url = | journal = Psychological Reports | volume = 78 | issue = | pages = 291–305 | doi=10.2466/pr0.1996.78.1.291}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results from another telepathy experiment involving 48 undergraduate college students (Rudski, 2002) were explained by [[Hindsight bias|hindsight]] and [[Confirmation bias|confirmation]] biases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rudski | first1 = J. M. | year = 2002 | title = Hindsight and confirmation biases in an exercise in telepathy | url = | journal = Psychological Reports | volume = 91 | issue = | pages = 899–906 | doi=10.2466/pr0.2002.91.3.899}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In parapsychology==
Within the field of [[parapsychology]], telepathy is considered to be a form of [[extrasensory perception]] (ESP) or anomalous cognition in which information is transferred through [[Psi (parapsychology)|Psi]]. It is often categorized similarly to [[precognition]] and [[clairvoyance]].&lt;ref name=parasoc2&gt;[http://parapsych.org/glossary_e_k.html#e Glossary of Parapsychological terms - ESP] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110111023207/http://parapsych.org/glossary_e_k.html |date=2011-01-11 }}, [[Parapsychological Association]]. Retrieved December 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments have been used to test for telepathic abilities. Among the most well known are the use of [[Zener card]]s and the [[Ganzfeld experiment]].

===Types===
Parapsychology describes several forms of telepathy:&lt;ref name=parasocie1/&gt;

* '''Latent telepathy''', formerly known as "deferred telepathy",&lt;ref name=sciam1&gt;Rennie, John (1845), "Test for Telepathy", ''[[Scientific American]]'', V3#1 (1847-09-25)&lt;/ref&gt; is described as the transfer of information, through Psi, with an observable time-lag between transmission and reception.&lt;ref name=parasocie1/&gt;
* '''Retrocognitive,{{Failed verification|date=July 2015}}  precognitive, and intuitive{{Failed verification|date=July 2015}}  telepathy''' is described as being the transfer of information, through Psi, about the past, future or present state of an individual's mind to another individual.&lt;ref name=parasocie1/&gt;
* '''Emotive telepathy''', also known as remote influence&lt;ref&gt;Plazo, Joseph R., (2002) "Psychic Seduction." pp.112-114 {{ISBN|0-9785922-3-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; or emotional transfer, is the process of transferring kinesthetic sensations through altered states.
* '''Superconscious telepathy''' involves tapping into the superconscious&lt;ref&gt;St. Claire, David., (1989) "Instant ESP." pp.40-50&lt;/ref&gt; to access the collective wisdom of the human species for knowledge.

===Zener Cards===
{{Main|Zener cards}}
[[File:Zener cards (color).svg|thumb|200px|right|Zener cards]]
[[Zener cards]] are marked with five distinctive symbols. When using them, one individual is designated the "sender" and another the "receiver". The sender selects a random card and visualize the symbol on it, while the receiver attempts to determine that symbol using Psi. Statistically, the receiver has a 20% chance of randomly guessing the correct symbol, so to demonstrate telepathy, they must repeatedly score a success rate that is significantly higher than 20%.&lt;ref name="Skepdic2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skepdic.com/zener.html |title=Zener ESP Cards |author=Carroll, Robert |date=2006-02-17 |publisher=[[The Skeptic's Dictionary]] |accessdate=2006-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If not conducted properly, this method can be vulnerable to sensory leakage and [[card counting]].&lt;ref name="Skepdic2"/&gt;

[[Joseph Banks Rhine|J. B. Rhine]]'s experiments with Zener cards were discredited due to the discovery that [[sensory leakage]] or cheating could account for all his results such as the subject being able to read the symbols from the back of the cards and being able to see and hear the experimenter to note subtle clues.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan C. Smith. (2009). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sJgONrua8IkC&amp;pg=PT226&amp;dq=rhine+pseudoscience&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MI2fUr7qIMqrhQelt4HgAg&amp;ved=0CDcQuwUwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=rhine%20pseudoscience&amp;f=false ''Pseudoscience and Extraordinary Claims of the Paranormal: A Critical Thinker's Toolkit'']. Wiley-Blackwell. {{ISBN|978-1405181228}}. "Today, researchers discount the first decade of Rhine's work with Zener cards. Stimulus leakage or cheating could account for all his findings. Slight indentations on the backs of cards revealed the symbols embossed on card faces. Subjects could see and hear the experimenter, and note subtle but revealing facial expressions or changes in breathing."&lt;/ref&gt; Once Rhine took precautions in response to criticisms of his methods, he was unable to find any high-scoring subjects.&lt;ref&gt;[[Milbourne Christopher]]. (1970). ''ESP, Seers &amp; Psychics''. Thomas Y. Crowell Company. p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the methodological problems, parapsychologists no longer utilize card-guessing studies.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Alcock]]. (2011). [http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/back_from_the_future ''Back from the Future: Parapsychology and the Bem Affair'']. ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]''. "Despite Rhine’s confidence that he had established the reality of extrasensory perception, he had not done so. Methodological problems with his experiments eventually came to light, and as a result parapsychologists no longer run card-guessing studies and rarely even refer to Rhine’s work."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dream telepathy===

Parapsychological studies into [[dream telepathy]] were carried out at the [[Maimonides Medical Center]] in [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn, New York]] led by [[Stanley Krippner]] and [[Montague Ullman]]. They concluded the results from some of their experiments supported dream telepathy.&lt;ref name=ullmanweb&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|title=Psychoanalysis and the paranormal: lands of darkness|series=Reference, Information and Interdisciplinary Subjects Series|editor1-first=Nick|editor1-last=Totton|publisher=Karnac Books| pages= 14–46|year=2003|isbn=978-1-85575-985-5|first=Montague|last=Ullman|authorlink=Montague Ullman|chapter=Dream telepathy: experimental and clinical findings}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the results have not been independently replicated.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, Adrian.

''Paranormal and Transcendental Experience: A Psychological Examination''. Dover Publications. p. 145. {{ISBN|0-486-26167-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychologist [[James Alcock]] has written the dream telepathy experiments at Maimonides have failed to provide evidence for telepathy and "lack of replication is rampant."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = James | first1 = Alcock | authorlink = James Alcock | year = 2003 | title = Give the Null Hypothesis a Chance: Reasons to Remain Doubtful about the Existence of Psi | url = | journal = Journal of Consciousness Studies | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 29–50 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The picture target experiments that were conducted by Krippner and Ullman were criticized by [[C. E. M. Hansel]]. According to Hansel there were weaknesses in the design of the experiments in the way in which the agent became aware of their target picture. Only the agent should have known the target and no other person until the judging of targets had been completed, however, an experimenter was with the agent when the target envelope was opened. Hansel also wrote there had been poor controls in the experiment as the main experimenter could communicate with the subject.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. E. M. Hansel|Hansel, C. E. M.]] ''The Search for a Demonstration of ESP''. In [[Paul Kurtz|Kurtz, Paul]]. (1985). ''A Skeptic's Handbook of Parapsychology''. Prometheus Books. pp. 97-127. {{ISBN|0-87975-300-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An attempt to replicate the experiments that used picture targets was carried out by Edward Belvedere and David Foulkes. The finding was that neither the subject nor the judges matched the targets with dreams above chance level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Belvedere | first1 = E. | last2 = Foulkes | first2 = D. | year = 1971 | title = Telepathy and Dreams: A Failure to Replicate | url = | journal = Perceptual and Motor Skills | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 783–789 | doi=10.2466/pms.1971.33.3.783}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results from other experiments by Belvedere and Foulkes were also negative.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. E. M. Hansel|Hansel, C. E. M]]. (1989). ''The Search for Psychic Power: ESP and Parapsychology Revisited''. Prometheus Books. pp. 141-152. {{ISBN|0-87975-516-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ganzfeld experiment===
When using the [[Ganzfeld experiment]] to test for telepathy, one individual is designated the receiver and is placed inside a controlled environment where they are [[sensory deprivation|deprived of sensory input]], and another is designated the sender and is placed in a separate location. The receiver is then required to receive information from the sender. The nature of the information may vary between experiments.&lt;ref name="ConsciousUniverse"&gt;''The Conscious Universe: The Scientific Truth of Psychic Phenomena'' by Dean I. Radin Harper Edge, {{ISBN|0-06-251502-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ganzfeld experiment studies that were examined by [[Ray Hyman]] and [[Charles Honorton]] had methodological problems that were well documented. Honorton reported only 36% of the studies used duplicate target sets of pictures to avoid handling cues.&lt;ref&gt;Julie Milton, [[Richard Wiseman]]. (2002). ''A Response to Storm and Ertel (2002)''. The Journal of Parapsychology. Volume 66: 183-186.&lt;/ref&gt; Hyman discovered flaws in all of the 42 ganzfeld experiments and to access each experiment, he devised a set of 12 categories of flaws. Six of these concerned statistical defects, the other six covered procedural flaws such as inadequate [[documentation]], randomization and security as well as possibilities of sensory leakage.&lt;ref name="Hyman2007"&gt;[[Ray Hyman]]. ''Evaluating Parapsychological Claims'' in Robert J. Sternberg, Henry L. Roediger, Diane F. Halpern. (2007). ''Critical Thinking in Psychology''. Cambridge University Press. pp. 216-231. {{ISBN|978-0521608343}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over half of the studies failed to safeguard against sensory leakage and all of the studies contained at least one of the 12 flaws. Because of the flaws, Honorton agreed with Hyman the 42 ganzfeld studies could not support the claim for the existence of psi.&lt;ref name="Hyman2007"/&gt;

Possibilities of sensory leakage in the ganzfeld experiments included the receivers hearing what was going on in the sender's room next door as the rooms were not soundproof and the sender's fingerprints to be visible on the target object for the receiver to see.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Wiseman]], Matthew Smith, Diana Kornbrot. (1996). ''Assessing possible sender-to-experimenter acoustic leakage in the PRL autoganzfeld''. Journal of Parapsychology. Volume 60: 97-128.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Todd Carroll]]. (2014).                                  [http://www.skepdic.com/ganzfeld.html "Ganzfeld]" in [[The Skeptic's Dictionary]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Hyman also reviewed the autoganzfeld experiments and discovered a pattern in the data that implied a visual cue may have taken place:

{{quote|The most suspicious pattern was the fact that the hit rate for a given target increased with the frequency of occurrence of that target in the experiment. The hit rate for the targets that occurred only once was right at the chance expectation of 25%. For targets that appeared twice the hit rate crept up to 28%. For those that occurred three times it was 38%, and for those targets that occurred six or more times, the hit rate was 52%. Each time a videotape is played its quality can degrade. It is plausible then, that when a frequently used clip is the target for a given session, it may be physically distinguishable from the other three decoy clips that are presented to the subject for judging. Surprisingly, the parapsychological community has not taken this finding seriously. They still include the autoganzfeld series in their meta-analyses and treat it as convincing evidence for the reality of psi.&lt;ref name="Hyman2007"/&gt;}}

Hyman wrote the autoganzfeld experiments were flawed because they did not preclude the possibility of sensory leakage.&lt;ref name="Hyman2007"/&gt; In 2010, Lance Storm, Patrizio Tressoldi, and Lorenzo Di Risio analyzed 29 ganzfeld studies from 1997 to 2008. Of the 1,498 trials, 483 produced hits, corresponding to a hit rate of 32.2%. This hit rate is [[Statistical significance|statistically significant]] with p &lt; .001. Participants selected for personality traits and personal characteristics thought to be psi-conducive were found to perform significantly better than unselected participants in the ganzfeld condition.&lt;ref name=StormEtAl2010&gt;

According to Hyman "reliance on meta-analysis as the sole basis for justifying the claim that an anomaly exists and that the evidence for it is consistent and replicable is fallacious. It distorts what scientists mean by confirmatory evidence." Hyman wrote the ganzfeld studies have not been independently replicated and have failed to produce evidence for telepathy.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, R. (2010).

===Twin telepathy===

Twin telepathy is a belief that has been described as a myth in psychological literature. Psychologists Stephen Hupp and Jeremy Jewell have noted that all experiments on the subject have failed to provide any scientific evidence for telepathy between [[twin]]s.&lt;ref name="Hupp 2015"&gt;Hupp, Stephen; Jewell, Jeremy. (2015). ''Great Myths of Child Development''. Wiley. pp. 10-16. {{ISBN|978-1-118-52122-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hupp and Jewell there are various behavioral and genetic factors that contribute to the twin telepathy myth "identical twins typically spend a lot of time together and are usually exposed to very similar environments. Thus, it's not at all surprising that they act in similar ways and are adept at anticipating and forecasting each other's reactions to events."&lt;ref name="Hupp 2015"/&gt;

A 1993 study by [[Susan Blackmore]] investigated the claims of twin telepathy. In an experiment with six sets of twins one subject would act as the sender and the other the receiver. The sender was given selected objects, photographs or numbers and would attempt to psychically send the information to the receiver. The results from the experiment were negative, no evidence of telepathy was observed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Wiseman|Wiseman, Richard]]. (2011). ''Paranormality: Why We See What Isn't There''.

The skeptical investigator [[Benjamin Radford]] has noted that "Despite decades of research trying to prove telepathy, there is no credible scientific evidence that psychic powers exist, either in the general population or among twins specifically. The idea that two people who shared their mother's womb — or even who share the same DNA — have a mysterious mental connection is an intriguing one not borne out in science."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/45405-twin-telepathy.html "The Riddle of Twin Telepathy"]. Retrieved 2014-06-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific reception==

A variety of tests have been performed to demonstrate telepathy, but there is no scientific evidence that the power exists.&lt;ref name="Dalkvist1994"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simon Hoggart, Mike Hutchinson. (1995). ''Bizarre Beliefs''. Richard Cohen Books. p. 145. {{ISBN|978-1573921565}} "The trouble is that the history of research into psi is littered with failed experiments, ambiguous experiments, and experiments which are claimed as great successes but are quickly rejected by conventional scientists. There has also been some spectacular cheating."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Cogan.  (1998). ''Critical Thinking: Step by Step''. University Press of America. p. 227. {{ISBN|978-0761810674}} "When an experiment can't be repeated and get the same result, this tends to show that the result was due to some error in experimental procedure, rather than some real causal process. ESP experiments simply have not turned up any repeatable paranormal phenomena."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Terence Hines]]. (2003). ''Pseudoscience and the Paranormal''. Prometheus Books. p. 144. {{ISBN|978-1573929790}} "It is important to realize that, in one hundred years of parapsychological investigations, there has never been a single adequate demonstration of the reality of any psi phenomenon."&lt;/ref&gt; A panel commissioned by the [[United States National Research Council]] to study paranormal claims concluded that "despite a 130-year record of scientific research on such matters, our committee could find no scientific justification for the existence of phenomena such as extrasensory perception, mental telepathy or 'mind over matter' exercises... Evaluation of a large body of the best available evidence simply does not support the contention that these phenomena exist."&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Gilovich]]. (1993). ''How We Know What Isn't So: The Fallibility of Human Reason in Everyday Life''. Free Press. p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific community considers [[parapsychology]] a pseudoscience.&lt;ref&gt;Daisie Radner, Michael Radner. (1982). ''Science and Unreason''.

Friedlander. (1998). ''At the Fringes of Science''. Westview Press. p. 119. {{ISBN|0-8133-2200-6}} "Parapsychology has failed to gain general scientific acceptance even for its improved methods and claimed successes, and it is still treated with a lopsided ambivalence among the scientific community. Most scientists write it off as pseudoscience unworthy of their time."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Massimo Pigliucci]], [[Maarten Boudry]]. (2013). ''Philosophy of Pseudoscience: Reconsidering the Demarcation Problem''. University Of Chicago Press p. 158. {{ISBN|978-0226051963}} "Many observers refer to the field as a "pseudoscience". When mainstream scientists say that the field of parapsychology is not scientific, they mean that no satisfying naturalistic cause-and-effect explanation for these supposed effects has yet been proposed and that the field's experiments cannot be consistently replicated."&lt;/ref&gt; There is no known mechanism for telepathy.&lt;ref&gt;Charles M. Wynn, Arthur W. Wiggins. (2001). ''Quantum Leaps in the Wrong Direction: Where Real Science Ends...and Pseudoscience Begins''. Joseph Henry Press. p. 165. {{ISBN|978-0309073097}} "One of the reasons scientists have difficulty believing that psi effects are real is that there is no known mechanism by which they could occur. PK action-at-a-distance would presumably employ an action-at-a-distance force that is as yet unknown to science... Similarly, there is no known sense (stimulation and receptor) by which thoughts could travel from one person to another by which the mind could project itself elsewhere in the present, future, or past."&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher and physicist [[Mario Bunge]] has written that telepathy would contradict [[laws of science]] and the claim that "signals can be transmitted across space without fading with distance is inconsistent with physics".&lt;ref&gt;[[Mario Bunge]]. (1983). ''Treatise on Basic Philosophy: Volume 6: Epistemology &amp; Methodology II: Understanding the World''. Springer. pp. 225-226. {{ISBN|978-9027716347}} 
* "Precognition violates the principle of antecedence ("causality"), according to which the effect does not happen before the cause. Psychokinesis violates the principle of conservation of energy as well as the postulate that mind cannot act directly on matter. (If it did no experimenter could trust his own readings of his instruments.) Telepathy and precognition are incompatible with the epistemological principle according to which the gaining of factual knowledge requires sense perception at some point."
* "Parapsychology makes no use of any knowledge gained in other fields, such as physics and physiological psychology. Moreover, its hypotheses are inconsistent with some basic assumptions of factual science. In particular, the very idea of a disembodied mental entity is incompatible with physiological psychology; and the claim that signals can be transmitted across space without fading with distance is inconsistent with physics."&lt;/ref&gt;

Physicist [[John G. Taylor|John Taylor]] has written the experiments that have been claimed by parapsychologists to support evidence for the existence of telepathy are based on the use of shaky statistical analysis and poor design, and attempts to duplicate such experiments by the scientific community have failed. Taylor also wrote the arguments used by parapsychologists for the feasibility of such phenomena are based on distortions of [[theoretical physics]] as well as "complete ignorance" of relevant areas of physics.&lt;ref&gt;[[John G. Taylor|John Taylor]]. (1980).

Temple Smith. p. 84. {{ISBN|0-85117-191-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist [[Stuart Sutherland]] wrote that cases of telepathy can be explained by people underestimating the probability of [[coincidence]]s. According to Sutherland, "most stories about this phenomenon concern people who are close to one another - husband and wife or brother and sister. Since such people have much in common, it is highly probable that they will sometimes think the same thought at the same time."&lt;ref&gt;[[Stuart Sutherland|Sutherland, Stuart]]. (1994). ''Irrationality: The Enemy Within''. p. 314. Penguin Books. {{ISBN|0-14-016726-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Graham Reed (psychologist)|Graham Reed]], a specialist in [[anomalistic psychology]], noted that experiments into telepathy often involve the subject relaxing and reporting the 'messages' to consist of colored geometric shapes. Reed wrote that these are a common type of [[Hypnagogia|hypnagogic image]] and not evidence for telepathic communication.&lt;ref&gt;[[Graham Reed (psychologist)|Graham Reed]]. (1988). ''The Psychology of Anomalous Experience''. Prometheus Books. pp. 38-42. {{ISBN|0-87975-435-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of parapsychology, telepathy is generally explained as the result of fraud, self-delusion and/or self-deception and not as a paranormal power.&lt;ref name="Planer1980"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skepdic.com/esp.html Skepdic.com on ESP]. Retrieved February 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychological research has also revealed other explanations such as [[confirmation bias]], [[Observer-expectancy effect|expectancy bias]], [[sensory leakage]], [[subjective validation]] and [[wishful thinking]].&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Zusne, Warren H. Jones. (1989). ''Anomalistic Psychology: A Study of Magical Thinking''. Psychology Press. {{ISBN|978-0805805086}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virtually all of the instances of more popular psychic phenomena, such as [[mediumship]], can be attributed to non-paranormal techniques such as [[cold reading]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ian Rowland]]. (1998). ''The Full Facts Book of Cold Reading''. Ian Rowland Limited: 4th Revised edition. {{ISBN|978-0955847608}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Derren Brown]]. (2007). ''Tricks of the Mind''. Channel 4: New edition. {{ISBN|978-1905026357}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magicians such as [[Ian Rowland]] and [[Derren Brown]] have demonstrated techniques and results similar to those of popular psychics, without paranormal means. They have identified, described, and developed psychological techniques of cold reading and [[hot reading]].

==Psychiatry==

The notion of telepathy is not dissimilar to two clinical concepts: [[delusions]] of [[thought insertion]]/[[thought withdrawal|removal]]. This similarity might explain how an individual might come to the conclusion that they were experiencing telepathy. Thought insertion/removal is a symptom of [[psychosis]], particularly of [[schizophrenia]], [[schizoaffective disorder]] or [[substance-induced psychosis]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Noll]]. (2007). ''The Encyclopedia of Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders''. Facts on File. p. 359. {{ISBN|978-0816064052}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychiatric patients who experience this symptom falsely believe that some of their thoughts are not their own and that others (e.g., other people, aliens, demons or fallen angels, or conspiring intelligence agencies) are putting thoughts into their minds (thought insertion). Some patients feel as if thoughts are being taken out of their minds or deleted (thought removal). Along with other symptoms of psychosis, delusions of thought insertion may be reduced by [[antipsychotic]] medication. Psychiatrists and clinical psychologists believe and empirical findings support the idea that people with [[schizotypy]] and   [[schizotypal personality disorder]] are particularly likely to believe in telepathy.&lt;ref&gt;Graham Pickup. (2006). ''Cognitive Neuropsychiatry''. Volume 11, Number 2, Number 2/March 2006. pp. 117-192&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Gumley, Matthias Schwannauer. (2006). ''Staying Well After Psychosis: A Cognitive Interpersonal Approach to Recovery and Relapse Prevention''. Wiley. p. 187. {{ISBN|978-0470021859}} "Schizotypy refers to a normal personality construct characterised by an enduring tendency to experience attenuated forms of hallucinatory (e.g. hearing one's own thoughts) and delusional experiences (e.g. beliefs in telepathy)."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mary Townsend. (2013). ''Essentials of Psychiatric Mental Health Nursing: Concepts of Care in Evidence-Based Practice''. F. A. Davis Company. p. 613. {{ISBN|978-0803638761}} "Individuals with schizotypal personality disorder are aloof and isolated and behave in a bland and apathetic manner. Magical thinking, ideas of reference, illusions, and depersonalization are part of their everybody world. Examples include superstitiousness, belief in clairvoyance, telepathy, or "six sense;" and beliefs that "others can feel my feelings."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in fiction==
{{See also category|Fiction about telepathy|Fictional telepaths}}
Telepathy is a common theme in modern [[fiction]] and [[science fiction]], with many [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]]s (such as the [[Races of StarCraft#Protoss|Protoss]] in the ''[[StarCraft]]'' franchise), [[superhero]]es, and [[supervillain]]s having telepathic ability.

'''Ubykh''', or '''Ubyx''', is an [[extinct language|extinct]] [[Northwest Caucasian languages|Northwest Caucasian language]] once spoken by the [[Ubykh people]] (who originally lived along the eastern coast of the [[Black Sea]] before migrating ''en masse'' to [[Ottoman Empire|Turkey]] in the 1860s).&lt;ref name=Koerner1998&gt;{{cite book |author=E. F. K. Koerner |title=First Person Singular III: Autobiographies by North American Scholars in the Language Sciences |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-SYou4fhWUgC&amp;pg=PA33 |date=1 January 1998 |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing |isbn=978-90-272-4576-2 |page=33 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ubykh language is [[ergative–absolutive language|ergative]] and [[polysynthetic language|polysynthetic]], with a high degree of [[agglutination]], with [[polypersonal agreement|polypersonal]] verbal agreement and a very large number of distinct [[consonant]]s but only two [[phoneme|phonemically distinct]] [[vowel]]s. With around eighty consonants, it has one of the largest inventories of consonants in the world,&lt;ref&gt;Charles King, The Ghost of Freedom (2008) p 15&lt;/ref&gt; the largest number for any language without [[click consonant|clicks]].

The name Ubykh is derived from {{lang|ady|Убыхыбзэ}} ({{IPA|/wəbəx/}}), its name in the Abdzakh [[Adyghe language]]. It is known in [[linguistics|linguistic]] literature by many names: variants of Ubykh, such as ''Ubikh'', {{lang|tr|Ubıh}} ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]) and {{lang|fr|Oubykh}} ([[French language|French]]); and ''Pekhi'' (from Ubykh {{IPA|/tʷaχə/}}) and its [[German language|German]]ised variant {{lang|de|Päkhy}}.

==Major features==
Ubykh is distinguished by the following features, some of which are shared with other Northwest Caucasian languages:

* It is [[ergative–absolutive language|ergative]], making no syntactic distinction between the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] of an [[intransitive verb|intransitive]] sentence and the [[direct object]] of a [[transitive verb|transitive]] sentence. [[Split ergativity]] plays only a small part, if at all.
* It is highly [[Agglutination|agglutinating]] and [[Polysynthetic language|polysynthetic]], using mainly monosyllabic or bisyllabic roots, but with single [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] words sometimes reaching nine or more syllables in length: {{IPA|/aχʲazbatɕʼaʁawdətʷaajlafaqʼajtʼmadaχ/}} ('if only you had not been able to make him take [it] all out from under me again for them'). [[Affix]]es rarely fuse in any way.
* It has a simple [[noun|nominal]] system, contrasting just three [[noun case]]s, and not always marking [[grammatical number]] in the direct case.
* Its system of [[Grammatical conjugation#Verbal agreement|verbal agreement]] is quite complex. English verbs must agree only with the subject; Ubykh verbs must agree with the subject, the direct object and the [[indirect object]], and [[benefactive]] objects must also be marked in the verb.
* It is [[phonology|phonologically]] complex as well, with 84 distinct [[consonant]]s (four of which, however, appear only in [[loan word]]s). According to some linguistic analyses, it only has two phonological vowels, but these vowels have a large range of [[allophone]]s because the range of consonants which surround them is so large.

== Phonology ==
{{Main|Ubykh phonology}}
Ubykh has 84 phonemic consonants, a record high amongst languages without [[click consonants]], but only 2 phonemic vowels. Four of these consonants are found only in loanwords and [[onomatopoeiae]]. There are nine basic places of articulation for the consonants and extensive use of secondary articulation, such that Ubykh has 20 different [[Uvular consonant|uvular]] phonemes. Ubykh distinguishes three types of [[postalveolar consonant]]s: apical, laminal, and laminal closed. Regarding the vowels, since there are only two phonemic vowels, there is a great deal of allophony.

==Grammar==
=== Morphosyntax ===

Ubykh is agglutinative and [[polysynthetic language|polysynthetic]]: {{IPA|/ʃəkʲʼaajəfanamət/}} ('we will not be able to go back'), {{IPA|/awqʼaqʼajtʼba/}} ('if you had said it'). Ubykh is often extremely concise in its word forms.

The boundaries between nouns and verbs in Ubykh is somewhat blurred. Any noun can be used as the root of a stative verb ({{IPA|/məzə/}} 'child', {{IPA|/səməzəjtʼ/}} 'I was a child'), and many verb roots can become nouns simply by the use of noun affixes ({{IPA|/qʼa/}} 'to say', {{IPA|/səqʼa/}} 'what I say').&lt;ref&gt;Dumézil, G. 1975 Le verbe oubykh: études descriptives et comparatives (The Ubykh Verb: Descriptive and Comparative Studies). Paris: Imprimerie Nationale&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, B. G. 2005 North-West Caucasian. Lingua 115: 91-145.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Nouns ====
The noun system in Ubykh is quite simple. Ubykh has three noun cases (the oblique-ergative case may be two homophonous cases with differing function, thus presenting four cases in total):
* direct or [[absolutive case]], marked with the bare [[root (linguistics)|root]]; this indicates the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] of an intransitive sentence and the [[direct object]] of a transitive sentence (e.g. {{IPA|/tət/}} 'a man')
* oblique-[[ergative case]], marked in -{{IPA|/n/}}; this indicates either the subject of a [[transitive verb|transitive]] sentence, targets of [[preverb]]s, or [[indirect object]]s which do not take any other suffixes ({{IPA|/məzən/}} '(to) a child')
* [[locative case]], marked in -{{IPA|/ʁa/}}, which is the equivalent of English ''in'', ''on'' or ''at''.

The [[instrumental case]] (-{{IPA|/awn(ə)/}}) was also treated as a case in Dumézil (1975). Another pair of [[postposition]]s, -{{IPA|/laaq/}} ('to[wards]') and -{{IPA|/ʁaafa/}} ('for'), have been noted as synthetic [[dative]]s (e.g. {{IPA|/aχʲəlaaq astʷadaw/}} 'I will send it to the prince'), but their status as cases is also best discounted.

Nouns do not distinguish [[grammatical gender]]. The [[definite article]] is {{IPA|/a/}} (e.g. {{IPA|/atət/}} 'the man'). There is no [[indefinite article]] directly equivalent to the English ''a'' or ''an'', but {{IPA|/za/}}-(root)-{{IPA|/ɡʷara/}} (literally 'one'-(root)-'certain') translates French ''un'' and Turkish ''bir'': e.g. {{IPA|/zanajnʃʷɡʷara/}} ('a certain young man').

[[Number]] is only marked on the noun in the ergative case, with -{{IPA|/na/}}. The number marking of the absolutive argument is either by [[suppletion|suppletive]] verb roots (e.g. {{IPA|/akʷən blas/}} 'he is in the car' vs. {{IPA|/akʷən blaʒʷa/}} 'they are in the car') or by verb suffixes: {{IPA|/akʲʼan/}} ('he goes'), {{IPA|/akʲʼaan/}} ('they go'). The [[grammatical person|second person]] [[plural]] prefix {{IPA|/ɕʷ/}}- triggers this plural suffix regardless of whether that prefix represents the ergative, the absolutive, or an [[oblique argument]]: 
*Absolutive: {{IPA|/ɕʷastʷaan/}} ('I give you all to him')
*Oblique: {{IPA|/səɕʷəntʷaan/}} ('he gives me to you all')
*Ergative: {{IPA|/asəɕʷtʷaan/}}  ('you all give it/them to me')
Note that, in this last sentence, the plurality of ''it'' ({{IPA|/a/}}-) is obscured; the meaning can be either 'I give ''it'' to you all' or 'I give ''them'' to you all'.

[[Adjective]]s, in most cases, are simply suffixed to the noun: {{IPA|/tʃəbʒəja/}} ('pepper') with {{IPA|/pɬə/}} ('red') becomes {{IPA|/tʃəbʒəjapɬə/}} ('red pepper'). Adjectives do not [[declension|decline]].

[[Postposition]]s are rare; most locative [[semantics|semantic]] functions, as well as some non-local ones, are provided with [[preverb]]al elements: {{IPA|/asχʲawtxqʼa/}} ('you wrote it for me'). However, there are a few postpositions: {{IPA|/səʁʷa səɡʲaatɕʼ/}} ('like me'), {{IPA|/aχʲəlaaq/}} ('near the prince').

==== Verbs ====

A [[past tense|past]]-[[present tense|present]]-[[future tense|future]] distinction of verb [[Grammatical tense|tense]] exists (the suffixes -{{IPA|/qʼa/}} and -{{IPA|/awt/}} represent past and future) and an [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]] [[grammatical aspect|aspect]] suffix is also found (-{{IPA|/jtʼ/}}, which can combine with tense suffixes). Dynamic and stative verbs are contrasted, as in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], and verbs have several [[gerund|nominal]] forms. Morphological [[causative]]s are not uncommon. The conjunctions {{IPA|/ɡʲə/}} ('and') and {{IPA|/ɡʲəla/}} ('but') are usually given with verb suffixes, but there is also a free particle corresponding to each:
*-{{IPA|/ɡʲə/}} 'and' (free particle {{IPA|/ve/}}, borrowed from Turkish);
*-{{IPA|/ɡʲəla/}} 'but' (free particle {{IPA|/aʁʷa/}})

Pronominal [[benefactive]]s are also part of the verbal complex, marked with the preverb {{IPA|/χʲa/}}-, but a benefactive cannot normally appear on a verb that has three agreement prefixes already.

[[Grammatical gender|Gender]] only appears as part of the [[grammatical person|second person]] paradigm, and then only at the speaker's discretion. The feminine second person index is {{IPA|/χa/}}-, which behaves like other pronominal prefixes: {{IPA|/wəsχʲantʷən/}} ('he gives [it] to you [normal; gender-neutral] for me'), but compare {{IPA|/χasχʲantʷən/}} 'he gives [it] to you [feminine] for me').

==== Adverbials ====
A few meanings covered in [[English language|English]] by [[adverb]]s or [[auxiliary verb]]s are given in Ubykh by verb suffixes:

*{{IPA|/asfəpχa/}} ('I need to drink it')
*{{IPA|/asfəfan/}} ('I can drink it')
*{{IPA|/asfəɡʲan/}} ('I drink it all the time')
*{{IPA|/asfəlan/}} ('I am drinking it all up')
*{{IPA|/asfətɕʷan/}} ('I drink it too much')
*{{IPA|/asfaajən/}} ('I drink it again')

==== Questions ====
[[Question]]s may be marked grammatically, using verb suffixes or prefixes:

*Yes-no questions with -{{IPA|/ɕ/}}: {{IPA|/wana awbjaqʼaɕ/}}? ('did you see that?')
*Complex questions with -{{IPA|/j/}}: {{IPA|/saakʲʼa wəpʼtsʼaj/}}? ('what is your name?')

Other types of questions, involving the pronouns 'where' and 'what', may also be marked only in the verbal complex: {{IPA|/maawkʲʼanəj/}} ('where are you going?'), {{IPA|/saawqʼaqʼajtʼəj/}} ('what had you said?').

==== Preverbs and determinants ====
Many local, prepositional, and other functions are provided by [[preverb]]al elements providing a large series of [[applicative voice|applicative]]s, and here Ubykh shows remarkable complexity. Two main types of preverbal elements exist in Ubykh: determinants and preverbs. The number of preverbs is limited, and mainly show [[Location (geography)|location]] and [[Direction (geometry, geography)|direction]]. The number of determinants is also limited, but the class is more [[open class word|open]]; some determinant prefixes include {{IPA|/tʃa/}}- ('with regard to a horse') and {{IPA|/ɬa/}}- ('with regard to the foot or base of an object').

For simple locations, there are a number of possibilities that can be encoded with preverbs, including (but not limited to):
* above and touching
* above and not touching
* below and touching
* below and not touching
* at the side of
* through a space
* through solid matter
* on a flat horizontal surface
* on a non-horizontal or vertical surface
* in a homogeneous mass
* towards
* in an upward direction
* in a downward direction
* into a tubular space
* into an enclosed space
There is also a separate directional preverb meaning 'towards the speaker': {{IPA|/j/}}-, which occupies a separate slot in the verbal complex. However, preverbs can have meanings that would take up entire phrases in English. The preverb {{IPA|/jtɕʷʼaa/}}- signifies 'on the earth' or 'in the earth', for instance: {{IPA|/ʁadja ajtɕʷʼaanaaɬqʼa/}} ('they buried his body'; literally, "they put his body in the earth"). Even more narrowly, the preverb {{IPA|/faa/}}- signifies that an action is done out of, into or with regard to a fire: {{IPA|/amdʒan zatʃətʃaqʲa faastχʷən/}} ('I take a brand out of the fire').

== Orthography ==
Writing systems for the Ubykh language have been proposed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fenwick|first=R. S. H.|title=A Grammar of Ubykh|year=2011|publisher=Lincom Europa|location=Munich}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there has never been a standard written form.

== Lexicon ==

=== Native vocabulary ===
Ubykh [[syllable]]s have a strong tendency to be CV, although VC and CVC also exist. [[Consonant cluster]]s are not as large as in Abzhywa [[Abkhaz language|Abkhaz]] or in [[Georgian language|Georgian]], rarely being larger than two terms. Three-term clusters exist in two words - {{IPA|/ndʁa/}} ('sun') and {{IPA|/psta/}} ('to swell up'), but the latter is a loan from Adyghe, and the former more often pronounced {{IPA|/nədʁa/}} when it appears alone.
[[Compound (linguistics)|Compounding]] plays a large part in Ubykh and, indeed, in all Northwest Caucasian [[semantics]]. There is no verb equivalent to English ''to love'', for instance; one says "I love you" as {{IPA|/tʂʼanə wəzbjan/}} ('I see you well').

[[Reduplication]] occurs in some roots, often those with [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] values ({{IPA|/χˤaχˤa/}}, 'to curry[comb]' from {{IPA|/χˤa/}} 'to scrape'; {{IPA|/kʼərkʼər/}}, 'to cluck like a chicken' [a loan from Adyghe]); and {{IPA|/warqwarq/}}, 'to croak like a frog').

Roots and affixes can be as small as one phoneme. The word {{IPA|/wantʷaan/}}, 'they give you to him', for instance, contains six phonemes, each a separate morpheme:

*{{IPA|/w/}} - 2nd singular absolutive
*{{IPA|/a/}} - 3rd singular dative
*{{IPA|/n/}} - 3rd ergative
*{{IPA|/tʷ/}} - to give
*{{IPA|/aa/}} - ergative plural
*{{IPA|/n/}} - present tense

However, some words may be as long as seven [[syllable]]s (although these are usually compounds): {{IPA|/ʂəqʷʼawəɕaɬaadətʃa/}} ('staircase').

=== Slang and idioms ===
As with all other languages, Ubykh is replete with [[idiom]]s. The word {{IPA|/ntʷa/}} ('door'), for instance, is an idiom meaning either "magistrate", "court", or "government." However, idiomatic constructions are even more common in Ubykh than in most other languages; the representation of abstract ideas with series of concrete elements is a characteristic of the Northwest Caucasian family. As mentioned above, the phrase meaning "I love you" translates literally as 'I see you well'; similarly, "you please me" is literally 'you cut my heart'. The term {{IPA|/wərəs/}} ('Russian'), a Turkish loan, has come to be a slang term meaning "infidel", "non-Muslim" or "enemy" (see [[#History|History]] below).

=== Foreign loans ===
The majority of loanwords in Ubykh are derived from either [[Adyghe language|Adyghe]] or [[Turkish language|Turkish]], with smaller numbers from [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Abkhaz language|Abkhaz]], and the [[South Caucasian languages]]. Towards the end of Ubykh's life, a large influx of Adyghe words was noted; Vogt (1963) notes a few hundred examples. The phonemes {{IPA|/ɡ/ /k/ /kʼ/}} were borrowed from Turkish and Adyghe. {{IPA|/ɬʼ/}} also appears to come from Adyghe, although it seems to have arrived earlier on. It is possible, too, that {{IPA|/ɣ/}} is a loan from Adyghe, since most of the few words with this phoneme are obvious Adyghe loans: {{IPA|/paaɣa/}} ('proud'), {{IPA|/ɣa/}} ('testis').

Many loanwords have Ubykh equivalents, but were dwindling in usage under the influence of Turkish, Circassian, and Russian equivalents:
* {{IPA|/bərwə/}} ('to make a hole in, to perforate' from Turkish) = {{IPA|/pɕaatχʷ/}}
* {{IPA|/tʃaaj/}} ('tea' from Turkish) = {{IPA|/bzəpɕə/}}
* {{IPA|/wərəs/}} ('enemy' from Turkish) = {{IPA|/bˤaqˤʼa/}}

Some words, usually much older ones, are borrowed from less influential stock: Colarusso (1994) sees {{IPA|/χˤʷa/}} ('pig') as a borrowing from a proto-[[Semitic languages|Semitic]] *''huka'', and {{IPA|/aɡʲarə/}} ('slave') from an [[Iranian language|Iranian]] root; however, Chirikba (1986) regards the latter as being of Abkhaz origin ( ← Abkhaz ''agər-wa'' 'lower cast of peasants; slave', literally 'Megrelian').

== Evolution ==

In the scheme of Northwest Caucasian evolution, despite its parallels with Adyghe and Abkhaz, Ubykh forms a separate third branch of the family. It has fossilised palatal class markers where all other Northwest Caucasian languages preserve traces of an original labial class: the Ubykh word for 'heart', {{IPA|/ɡʲə/}}, corresponds to the reflex {{IPA|/ɡʷə/}} in Abkhaz, Abaza, Adyghe, and Kabardian. Ubykh also possesses groups of pharyngealised consonants. All other NWC languages possess true pharyngeal consonants, but Ubykh is the only language to use pharyngealisation as a feature of secondary articulation.

With regard to the other languages of the family, Ubykh is closer to Adyghe and Kabardian{{Contradict-inline|article=Abkhaz language#Classification|date=June 2013}} but shares many features with Abkhaz due to geographic influence;&lt;!-- how so? Ubykh was not spoken in Abkhazia --&gt; many later Ubykh speakers were bilingual in Ubykh and Adyghe.&lt;!-- this actually suggests that [[Abkhaz language#Classification]] is right and that it is the other way round: Bilinguality suggests geographical/areal contact influence from Adyghe, rather than Abkhaz, which wasn't spoken in the same area, after all --&gt;

=== Dialects ===
While not many dialects of Ubykh existed, one divergent [[dialect]] of Ubykh has been noted (in Dumézil 1965:266-269). Grammatically, it is similar to standard Ubykh (i.e. [[Tevfik Esenç]]'s dialect), but has a very different sound system, which had collapsed into just 62-odd phonemes:
* {{IPA|/dʷ/ /tʷ/ /tʷʼ/}} have collapsed into {{IPA|/b/ /p/ /pʼ/}}.
* {{IPA|/ɕʷ/ /ʑʷ/}} are indistinguishable from {{IPA|/ʃʷ/ /ʒʷ/}}.
* {{IPA|/ɣ/}} seems to have disappeared.
* Pharyngealisation is no longer distinctive, having been replaced in many cases by [[geminate]] consonants.
* Palatalisation of the uvular consonants is no longer phonemic.

== History ==
Ubykh was spoken in the eastern coast of the [[Black Sea]] around [[Sochi]] until 1864, when the Ubykhs were driven out of the region by the [[Russia]]ns. They eventually came to settle in [[Turkey]], founding the villages of [[Hacı Osman]], [[Kırkpınar (village)|Kırkpınar]], Masukiye and [[Hacı Yakup]]. [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Circassian language|Circassian]] eventually became the preferred languages for everyday communication, and many words from these languages entered Ubykh in that period.

Thousands of pages of material and many audio recordings had been collected and collated by a number of linguists, including [[Georges Charachidzé]], [[Georges Dumézil]], [[Hans Vogt (linguist)|Hans Vogt]], [[George Hewitt (linguist)|George Hewitt]] and [[A. Sumru Özsoy]], with the help of some of its last speakers, particularly Tevfik Esenç and [[Huseyin Kozan]].&lt;ref name=Koerner1998/&gt; Ubykh was never [[written language|written]] by its speech community, but a few phrases were transcribed by [[Evliya Celebi]] in his [[Seyahatname]] and a substantial portion of the oral literature, along with some cycles of the [[Nart saga]], was transcribed. Tevfik Esenç also eventually learned to write Ubykh in the transcription that Dumézil devised.

[[Julius von Mészáros]], a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] linguist, visited Turkey in 1930 and took down some notes on Ubykh. His work ''[[Die Päkhy-Sprache]]'' was extensive and accurate to the extent allowed by his transcription system (which could not represent all the phonemes of Ubykh) and marked the foundation of Ubykh linguistics.

The [[France|Frenchman]] [[Georges Dumézil]] also visited Turkey in 1930 to record some Ubykh and would eventually become the most celebrated Ubykh linguist. He published a collection of Ubykh folktales in the late 1950s, and the language soon attracted the attention of linguists for its small number (two) of phonemic vowels. [[Hans Vogt (linguist)|Hans Vogt]], a [[Norway|Norwegian]], produced a monumental [[dictionary]] that, in spite of its many errors (later corrected by Dumézil), is still one of the masterpieces and essential tools of Ubykh linguistics.

Later in the 1960s and into the early 1970s, Dumézil published a series of papers on Ubykh [[etymology]] in particular and Northwest Caucasian etymology in general. Dumézil's book ''Le Verbe Oubykh'' (1975), a comprehensive account of the verbal and nominal morphology of the language, is another cornerstone of Ubykh linguistics.

Since the 1980s, Ubykh [[linguistics]] has slowed drastically. No other major treatises have been published; however, the Dutch linguist [[Rieks Smeets]] is currently trying to compile a new Ubykh dictionary based on Vogt's 1963 book, and a similar project is also underway in Australia. The Ubykh themselves have shown interest in relearning their language.

The Abkhaz writer [[Bagrat Shinkuba]]'s historical novel [http://www.circassianlibrary.org/lib/html/Shinkuba-The_Last_of_the_Departed/contents.html Bagrat Shinkuba. ''The Last of the Departed''] treats the fate of the Ubykh people.

People who have published literature on Ubykh include
* Brian George Hewitt
* Catherine Paris
* Christine Leroy
* Georg Bossong
* [[Georges Dumézil]]
* [[Hans Vogt (linguist)|Hans Vogt]]
* [[John Colarusso]]
* Julius von Mészáros
* Rieks Smeets
* Rohan Fenwick
* [[Tevfik Esenç]]
* [[Viacheslav Chirikba]]
* Wim Lucassen

===Notable characteristics===
Ubykh has been cited in the ''Guinness Book of Records'' (1996 ed.) as the language with the most consonant [[phoneme]]s, although it may have fewer than some of the [[Khoisan languages]]. It has 20 [[uvular consonant|uvular]] and 29 pure [[fricative]] phonemes, more than any other known language.

'''Vlaho Getaldić''' (also '''Biagio Ghetaldi'''; 22 December 1788 - 27 October 1872) was a Dalmatian writer, translator and politician from Dubrovnik.

Born in the [[Republic of Ragusa]]. He was the grand-nephew of the renowned [[Marin Getaldić]], and descendant of Gundulić family through his mother's line. He was member and president of the Council "Reign of Dalmatia" based in the city of [[Zadar]], which consisted of eight individuals. Getaldić married Ana Božidarević. His cousin, the Mayor of Ragusa, [[Šišmundo Getaldić-Gundulić]] married with the sister of Malvina Božidarević.

The [[Austrian Empire]] gave him the title of Baron in 1846. In 1865 Vlaho translated ''Osman'' (by [[Ivan Gundulić]]) from [[Croatian language|Croatian]] into [[Latin language|Latin]] [[hexameter]]s. In the short introduction, Vlaho gave the rules of his translations.&lt;br&gt;
Also, Vlaho wrote poetry in Latin.

'''West Central German''' ({{lang-de|Westmitteldeutsche Dialekte}}) belongs to the [[Central German|Central]], [[High German languages|High German]] dialect family in the [[German language]]. Its dialects are thoroughly [[Franconian languages|Franconian]] and comprise the parts of the [[Rhinelandic]] continuum located south of the [[Benrath line]] isogloss, including the following sub-families:
* '''[[Central Franconian]]''' (''Mittelfränkisch'')
** [[Ripuarian language|Ripuarian]] (''Ripuarisch''), spoken in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] (including [[Colognian language|Kölsch]]) and [[German-speaking Community of Belgium|German-speaking Belgium]] and a small edge in the south of the [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Dutch province of Limbourg]].
** [[Moselle Franconian dialects|Moselle Franconian]] (''Moselfränkisch'') in [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], [[Saarland]] and [[France]] (''francique mosellan'')
*** [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]] (''Lëtzebuergesch, luxembourgeois'') in [[Luxembourg]], Belgium and France (''francique luxembourgeois'')
*** [[Riograndenser Hunsrückisch German|Riograndenser Hunsrückisch]], spoken in Brazil and derived from the Hunsrückisch dialect of Moselle Franconian
* '''[[Rhine Franconian dialects|Rhine Franconian]]''' (''Rheinfränkisch'', ''francique rhénan'') 
** [[Palatine German language|Palatinate Franconian]] (''Pfälzisch'', ''francique palatin''), spoken in [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]
*** [[Lorraine Franconian]] (''Lothringisch'', ''francique lorrain'') in the French region of [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]]
*** [[Bukovina Germans|Bukovina German]] (''Bukowinadeutsch'') in [[Bukovina]] (extinct)
*** [[Pennsylvania German language|Pennsylvania German]] (''Pennsylvaniadeutsch'') in historical communities in North America, especially in [[Pennsylvania]].
** [[Hessian dialects|Hessian]] (''Hessisch'') in [[Hesse]] and the [[Rhenish Hesse]] region of Rhineland-Palatinate
*** [[Hessian dialects|North Hessian]] (''Nordhessisch'')
*** [[Hessian dialects|Central Hessian]] (''Mittelhessisch'')
*** [[Hessian dialects|East Hessian]] (''Osthessisch'')

Apart from ''West Central German'' on the southern edge and in south-east Franconian dialects are turning to ''Upper German''. This transition area between ''[[Central German]]'' and ''[[Upper German]]'' is captured by the dialect families of [[South Franconian German]] and [[East Franconian German]], colloquially miscalled ''Franconian'' as dialects of this sub-family are spoken all over ''[[Franconia]]''.

'''William Courtney Dowling''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|aʊ|l|ɪ|ŋ}}; born April 5, 1944 in [[Warner, New Hampshire]]) is University Distinguished Professor of English and American Literature emeritus at [[Rutgers University]] in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]], specializing in 18th-century [[English literature]], literature of the early American Republic, and [[Literary Theory]].

==Biography==
Born in [[Warner, New Hampshire]], Dowling earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (A.B.) at [[Dartmouth College]] in [[Hanover, New Hampshire]], where he was editor of the [[Dartmouth Jack-O-Lantern]], the college humor magazine, a Senior Fellow in English,&lt;ref&gt;''Senior Fellowships of Dartmouth College, 1930-2000'', ed. Sandra Gregg, Brian J. Reilly, and James Tatum. Hanover, NH, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; and recipient of the Perkins Prize in English and Classics.&lt;ref&gt;"Edwin R. Perkins Prize in English and Classics," Dartmouth College Catalogue (Hanover, NH, 1920).&lt;/ref&gt; He received his [[Master of Arts]] (M.A.) and [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (Ph.D.) from [[Harvard University]], where he administered the [[Dudley House (Harvard College)|Dudley House]] fellowship program during the Mastership of [[Jean Mayer]]. Dowling is a past fellow of the [[Institute for Advanced Studies in the Humanities]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]] and the [[National Humanities Center]], and has held [[Guggenheim Fellowship|Guggenheim]], [[National Endowment for the Humanities]], and Howard Foundation fellowships. In 1994-95, he was Senior [[Fulbright Lecturer]] in American Literature at the [[Universidad Autonoma de Madrid]] He is past winner of the Richard Beale Davis Prize for work in early American literature and a New Jersey Council of the Humanities award for his book ''Oliver Wendell Holmes in Paris: Medicine, Theology, and the Autocrat of the Breakfast Table''; In 2012 he was the recipient of the [[Drake Group]]'s Robert Maynard Hutchins Award for his part in the struggle against Div IA athletics corruption in American higher education.

Dowling came to national attention in the 1990s through his work with the Rutgers 1000 campaign which fought for the removal of Division I sports from Rutgers.

In September 2007, a controversy arose when Rutgers Athletic Director [[Robert Mulcahy]] accused Dowling of racism for having dismissed, in a ''New York Times'' interview, the claim that athletic scholarships provide educational opportunities for minority students: "If you were giving the scholarship to an intellectually brilliant kid who happens to play a sport, that's fine. But they give it to a functional illiterate who can't read a cereal box, and then make him spend 50 hours a week on physical skills. That's not opportunity. If you want to give financial help to minorities, go find the ones who are at the library after school."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=FREEDMAN|first=SAMUEL G.|title=To the Victors at Rutgers Also Goes the ‘Spoilsport’|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/26/education/26education.html?_r=0|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Wall Street Journal]] labeled Mulcahy's attack a "campaign of character assassination" against a professor who had spoken out against athletics corruption at his university. In New Jersey, Dowling was most memorably defended by Donald and [[Roscoe Brown]], in a column in the [[Trenton Times]] (2 October 2007): "I -- and many other blacks -- agree with Professor Dowling, that if Rutgers were serious about enhancing the development of a black intelligentsia, it would start recruiting 'black kids found in the library after school' as aggressively as it does black kids whose primary attributes are an ability to run fast and/or to jump high. Right on, Brother Dowling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=BROWN|first=DONALD ROSCOE|title=Rutgers professor isn't racist|url=https://www.wcdrutgers.net/mulmack3.html|date=October 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rutgers administration responded by releasing announcements stating that Rutgers ranks highly among state universities in the Academic Progress Report rankings compiled by the NCAA for the use of member schools.

''Confessions of a Spoilsport: My Life and Hard Times Fighting Sports Corruption at an Old Eastern University'', Dowling's memoir of the Rutgers 1000 campaign, was the occasion of a long personal interview in ''Inside Higher Education,''[http://www.wcdrutgers.net/wcdihe.html] and received substantial coverage in ''The New York Times,'' ''The Weekly Standard'', ''The Manchester Guardian'', and other publications. An interview with [[Ralph Nader]]'s anti-sports-corruption group appeared on [http://leagueoffans.org/2012/03/27/qs-as-with-leading-sports-activists-william-dowling ''League of Fans''] in 2012. According to his Rutgers University web page, Dowling is presently at work on ''Professor's Song: A Life in Teaching'', a memoir of his career in literary studies.
