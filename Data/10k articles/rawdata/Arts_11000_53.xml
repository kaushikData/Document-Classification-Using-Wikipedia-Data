==Background==
The film was based on a popular folk tale about a sinner Saint's garb, who had the princess Chinthamani under his control and how he uses her as a pawn to achieve his goals. Those who were interested in marrying the princess were asked four intriguing questions by her and those who could not answer were beheaded as a punishment. When 999 of princes were killed like this, the film reveals how a prince goes about finding the answers.{{sfn|Dhananjayan|2014|page=70}}

==Plot==
A Saint (M. R. Swaminathan) wants to become all powerful (Ashtamasithi) and prays to obtain such powers. He was told that if he could achieve the sacrifice of 1000 men, he shall achieve such a supreme power. As he cannot achieve this feat on his own, he works out a plan. Princess Apoorva Chinthamani ([[V. N. Janaki]]) is the daughter of King Neethi Kethu ([[M. G. Chakrapani]]). Due to her intelligence knowledge and interest in various arts, she is referred to as ''Apoorva Chinthamani''. The happy King encourages her learn more. The magician comes to the Aditayapuri Kingdom in the garb of a Saint and becomes Chinthamani's teacher.

Gradually, he brings her under his control and manipulates her to achieve his goals. When she attains marriageable age, the magician advises that she should get an equally knowledgeable man and hence asks her to organise a contest whereby three peculiar questions will be asked to the aspiring grooms, those who fail to answer will beheaded. Since only the magician knows the answers, he is sure that he can behead 1000 prospective grooms who fail to answer and thus achieve his target of 1000 sacrifices.

The justification for the killings is to prevent leakage of the questions to other contestants. Chinthamani agrees and also convinces her father for the contest. The first to be sacrificed happens to be her cousin Purantharan (E. R. Sahadevan), who is keen to marry her. In this manner, she kills 999 people, which includes six elder brothers of Prince Meyyazhagan (P. S. Govindan). He decides to take revenge on Chinthamani when he comes to know about the killings, and comes to her kingdom with his friend and assistant Kali ([[Kali N. Rathnam]]). They decide to find the questions and their answers before venturing to meet Chinthamani. In this process, the prince falls in love with Chinthamani's friend Princess Sengamalam ([[S. Varalakshmi]]).

Through her, he learns the questions. He goes to various countries named as Madhivadhanapuram, Sambangi Puram and Nathiseela Puram, finds the answers and brings the people involved with him to Chinthamani's palace. He answers the questions and wins the contest. Along with that, he also exposes the game plan of the magician, who gets killed by one of the kings affected by him. The prince advises Chinthamani to marry her cousin who was keen to marry her and marries her friend, Sengamalam.{{sfn|Dhananjayan|2014|page=71}}

==Reception==

This was the first film which presented several sub-plots and inner sub-plots in a flashback and stories were presented logically making the entire film interesting and a big hit among the masses. The film was very popular with the masses for its interesting script. The film had several sub-plots and inner sub-plots which were interwoven logically. These sub-plots were presented in flashback mode and become a landmark in the history of Tamil Cinema as it was the first time such a technique was used effectively on the screen. Another highlight, was the comedy scenes of [[Kali N. Rathnam]] and [[C. T. Rajakantham]], which were presented well.{{sfn|Dhananjayan|2014|page=71}}

[[Kali N. Rathnam]], who acts as a dumb person in a scene sang the most popular song of [[M. K. Thyagaraja Bhagavathar]]'s [[Haridas (1944 film)|Haridas]](1944) ''Manmadha leelai Vendrar Undo'', through miming and music and created a sensation among the audience. The screenplay and dialogue were written by the Popular Tamil poet Pavendar [[Bharathidasan]], but he did not wish to be credited in the titles as his convictions were against the concept of the film with illogical or unbelievable  folk tales.

==Remake==
The film was later remade in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] in 1960 under the title ''Sahasra Sirachedha Apoorva Chinthamani'' by the same producer [[Modern Theatres]] and was directed by S. S. Lal&amp;nbsp;— S. D. Lal. The film dialogues was written by Athreya. C. A. S. Mani and Madhavan Nair handled camera and L. Balu edited the movie. The movie released on 1 April 1960. Music by [[K. V. Mahadevan]] and Lyrics by Athreya are assets to the film. The film starred [[Kantha Rao]], [[Devika]], Girija, Gumnadi and Ramana Reddy, paired with Chayadevi and M. L. Narayanan playing lead, with Haranath, Rajanala, [[Rajasri]], Allu Ramalingaiah, Jayanthi, Kaikala Satyanarayanan and [[B. S. Saroja]] playing supporting roles.&lt;ref name="thehindu2"&gt;{{cite  web |author=M. L. Narasimham |url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/history-and-culture/Sahasra-Siracheda-Apoorva-Chintamani-1960/article8280717.ece |title=Sahasra Siracheda Apoorva Chintamani 1960 |publisher="[[The Hindu]]" |date=25 February 2006 |accessdate=2016-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tamil version ran to nearly four hours with 20,050&amp;nbsp;ft. length. S. D. Lal trimmed it down to 17,000&amp;nbsp;ft.length. He had deftly linked the three sub-plots to the main story and presented the third sub-plot by showing the actual incidents as inter-cuts. This technique was appreciated by both audience and the critics. The film was a big success in [[Telugu language|Telugu]].

[[Kongara Jaggaiah]] was the original choice to play the hero and a few days work was also done on him. Despite polite requests not to smoke on the set, Jaggaiah continued with his habit. [[T. R. Sundaram]] settled his account and called [[Kantha Rao]] who was chosen to play one of the princes for a fresh make-up test and took him for the lead role.&lt;ref name="thehindu2"/&gt;

'''Arthur Coleman Danto''' (January 1, 1924 – October 25, 2013) was an American [[art critic]] and  philosopher. He is best known for having been an influential, long-time art critic for ''[[The Nation]]'' and for his work in philosophical [[aesthetics]] and [[philosophy of history]], though he contributed significantly to a number of fields, including the philosophy of action. His interests included thought, feeling, [[philosophy of art]], theories of [[Representation (arts)|representation]], [[Theoretical psychology|philosophical psychology]], [[Hegel]]'s aesthetics, and the philosophers [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Arthur Schopenhauer]].

==Background and education==
Danto was born in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], January 1, 1924, and grew up in [[Detroit]].&lt;ref name="Times obituary"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/28/arts/design/arthur-c-danto-a-philosopher-of-art-is-dead-at-89.html?_r=0|last=Johnson|first=Ken|authorlink=Ken Johnson (art critic)|date=October 27, 2013|title=Arthur C. Danto, a Philosopher of Art, Is Dead at 89|work=The New York Times|accessdate=28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised in a [[Reform Jewish]] home.&lt;ref name="Times of Israel obituary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/groundbreaking-art-critic-arthur-danto-dies-at-89/|last=Italie|first=Hillel|date=October 28, 2013|title=Groundbreaking art critic Arthur Danto dies at 89|work=The Times of Israel|accessdate=6 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After spending two years in the Army, Danto studied art and history at Wayne University (now [[Wayne State University]]) and then pursued graduate study in philosophy at [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref name="Times obituary"/&gt; From 1949 to 1950, Danto studied in Paris on a [[Fulbright scholarship]] under [[Jean Wahl]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nakedpunch.com/articles/88 Arthur Danto - Interviewed by Zoe Sutherland]. ''[[Naked Punch]]'', 10 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1951 returned to teach at Columbia.&lt;ref name="Times obituary"/&gt; In 1992 he was named Johnsonian Professor Emeritus of Philosophy.&lt;ref name="Times obituary"/&gt;  He was twice awarded fellowships from the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|Guggenheim Foundation]] and was a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].

==Thought==
Arthur Danto argues that "a problem is not a philosophical problem unless it is possible to imagine that its solution will consist in showing how appearance has been taken for reality."&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Danto, ''Connections to the World: The Basic Concepts of Philosophy'' (New York: Harper and Row, 1989), p.6.&lt;/ref&gt;  While science deals with empirical problems, philosophy according to Danto examines indiscernible differences that lie outside of experience.&lt;ref&gt;Noel Carroll, "Danto's Comic Vision: Philosophical Method and Literary Style," ''Philosophy and Literature'' 39.2 (October 2015), p. 556.&lt;/ref&gt;

Danto "believes that persons are essentially systems of representation."&lt;ref&gt;Noel Carroll, "Danto's Comic Vision: Philosophical Method and Literary Style," ''Philosophy and Literature'' 39.2 (October 2015), p. 563 n. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Artworld" and the definition of art===
Danto laid the groundwork for an institutional definition of art&lt;ref&gt;This theory has been described as an "influential theory about the nature of art", according to [http://philosophynow.org/issues/99/News_November_December_2013 Philosophy Now, November 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; that sought to answer the questions raised by the emerging phenomenon of twentieth-century art. The definition of the term “art” is a subject of constant contention and many books and journal articles have been published arguing over the answer to the question "[[Aesthetics|What is Art?]]" Definitions can be categorized into conventional and non-conventional definitions. Non-conventional definitions take a concept like the aesthetic as an intrinsic characteristic in order to account for the phenomena of art. Conventional definitions reject this connection to aesthetic, formal, or expressive properties as essential to defining art but rather, in either an institutional or historical sense, say that “art” is basically a sociological category. In terms of [[classificatory disputes about art]], Danto takes a conventional approach. His "institutional definition of art" considers whatever art schools, museums, and artists get away with, regardless of formal definitions. Danto has written on this subject in several of his recent works and a detailed treatment is to be found in ''Transfiguration of the Commonplace''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Danto | first = Arthur | authorlink = Arthur Danto | coauthors = | title = The transfiguration of the commonplace: a philosophy of art | publisher = Harvard University Press | year = 1981 | location = | pages = | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=LIW60mm5QJkC&amp;dq=transfiguration+of+the+commonplace| doi = | isbn = 978-0-674-90346-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The essay "The Artworld" in which Danto coined the term “artworld”, by which he meant cultural context or “an atmosphere of art theory,”&lt;ref name="The Definition of Art"&gt;Adajian, Thomas. [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/art-definition/ "The Definition of Art"], ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', London, Oct 23, 2007. &lt;!--accessed December 21, 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; first appeared in the ''Journal of Philosophy''  (1964) and has since been widely reprinted. It has had considerable influence on aesthetic philosophy and, according to professor of philosophy [[Stephen David Ross]], "especially upon [[George Dickie (philosopher)|George Dickie's]] [[institutional theory of art]]. Dickie defines an art work as an artifact 'which has had conferred upon it the status of candidate for appreciation by some person or persons acting in behalf of a certain social institution (the artworld)' (p. 43.)"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ross | first = Stephen David | authorlink = Stephen David Ross | coauthors = | title = Art and its Significance | publisher = SUNY Press | year = 1984 | location = | pages = 469 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vDdZNwTmEqUC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=danto&amp;f=false | doi = | isbn = 0-87395-764-4 }} Note: Ross also refers us to Dickie's book ''Art and the Aesthetic'' (Cornell University Press, 1974).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', "Danto's definition has been glossed as follows: something is a work of art if and only if (i) it has a subject (ii) about which it projects some attitude or point of view (has a style) (iii) by means of rhetorical ellipsis (usually metaphorical) which ellipsis engages audience participation in filling in what is missing, and (iv) where the work in question and the interpretations thereof require an art historical context. (Danto, Carroll) Clause (iv) is what makes the definition institutionalist. The view has been criticized for entailing that art criticism written in a highly rhetorical style is art, lacking but requiring an independent account of what makes a context art historical, and for not applying to music."&lt;ref name="The Definition of Art"/&gt;

===The end of art===
The basic meaning of the term "art" has changed several times over the centuries and continued to evolve during the 20th century as well. Danto describes the history of Art in his own contemporary version of [[Hegel|Hegel's]] dialectical history of art. "Danto is not claiming that no-one is making art anymore; nor is he claiming that no good art is being made any more. But he thinks that a certain history of western art has come to an end, in about the way that Hegel suggested it would."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rowan.edu/open/philosop/clowney/Aesthetics/philos_artists_onart/danto.htm#top |title=Arthur Danto |accessdate=2009-12-21 |last=Cloweny |first=David W. |date=December 21, 2009 |publisher=Rowan university |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091227094138/http://www.rowan.edu/open/philosop/clowney/Aesthetics/philos_artists_onart/danto.htm#top |archive-date=December 27, 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The "end of art" refers to the beginning of our modern era of art in which art no longer adheres to the constraints of [[mimesis|imitation theory]] but serves a new purpose. Art began with an "era of imitation, followed by an era of ideology, followed by our post-historical era in which, with qualification, anything goes... In our narrative, at first only mimesis [imitation] was art, then several things were art but each tried to extinguish its competitors, and then, finally, it became apparent that there were no stylistic or philosophical constraints. There is no special way works of art have to be. And that is the present and, I should say, the final moment in the master narrative. It is the end of the story."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Danto | first = Arthur Coleman | authorlink = Arthur Danto | coauthors =  | title = After the end of art: contemporary art and the pale of history | publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 1998 | location =  | pages = 47 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=2y2ChJWfYoYC&amp;dq=after+the+end+of+art. | doi =  | isbn = 0-691-00299-1 }} As quoted by Professor David W. Cloweny on his website.

In 1996, he received the [[Frank Jewett Mather]] Award for art criticism from the [[College Art Association]].&lt;ref name="caa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegeart.org/awards/matherpast|title=Awards|publisher=The College Art Association|accessdate=11 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was one of the signers of the [[Humanist Manifesto II|Humanist Manifesto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_II |title=Humanist Manifesto II |publisher=American Humanist Association |accessdate=October 7, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020110719/http://www.americanhumanist.org/humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_II |archivedate=October 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Australia ICOMOS''' is the peak cultural heritage conservation body in Australia. It is a branch of the United Nations-sponsored [[International Council on Monuments and Sites]] (ICOMOS), a non-government professional organisation promoting expertise in the conservation of cultural heritage.&lt;ref name=PlanAust&gt;Susan Thompson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cE37xlhiF1cC ''Planning Australia: An Overview of Urban and Regional Planning''] (Cambridge University Press, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Its secretariat is based at the [[Cultural Heritage Centre for Asia and the Pacific]] at [[Deakin University]].

==Formation and role==

Australia ICOMOS was formed in 1976 and is one of over 100 current ICOMOS national committees. ICOMOS was formed in 1965 to advise [[UNESCO]] in the assessment of sites proposed for the [[World Heritage List]]. Membership of Australia ICOMOS comprises over 650 members, managed by an Executive Committee of 15 people who are elected from the membership. Several Australia ICOMOS members are also represented on various ICOMOS [[International Council on Monuments and Sites#International committees|International Scientific Committees]], and expert committees and boards in Australia.&lt;ref name=AI&gt;[http://australia.icomos.org/about-us/australia-icomos/mission-statement/ Australia ICOMOS Website]&lt;/ref&gt; It plays an important role in co-ordinating advocacy activities to raise the profile of Australia's cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationaltrust.org.au/Assets/1176/1/AustralianHeritagePartnership-3August20111.pdf National Trust Australia, Media Release 3 August 2011] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618020304/http://www.nationaltrust.org.au/Assets/1176/1/AustralianHeritagePartnership-3August20111.pdf |date=18 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first meeting which led to the formation of Australia ICOMOS was in Melbourne on 20 October 1976, and the first ICOMOS conference was in Beechworth in 1978, where they devised a committee to work up a local version of the [[Venice Charter]]. The actual ICOMOS meeting where the committee's draft was provisionally endorsed was in the town of [[Burra, South Australia|Burra]] in 1979.&lt;ref name=PlanAust/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://australia.icomos.org/publications/charters/ Australia ICOMOS &gt; The Burra Charter] Full text of the 1999 revised version of the Burra Charter. Retrieved 16 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AI/&gt; Australia ICOMOS played the pivotal role in developing and [[Burra Charter]], regarded as the best-practice standard for cultural heritage management in Australia, which has influenced subsequent heritage legislation and conservation guidelines and practices in Australia.&lt;ref name=PlanAust/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marta De la Torre, Getty Conservation Institute, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pj24e6iE7DoC ''Heritage Values in Site Management: Four Case Studies''] (Getty Publications, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia ICOMOS has also been responsible for producing the Australia [[State of the Environment]] Report (SoE), to advise the Minister for Environment on ''...the current condition of the Australian environment, the pressures on it and the drivers of those pressures.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environment.gov.au/soe/2011/report/heritage/pubs/soe2011-supplementary-heritage-icomos-workshop-notes.pdf Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Australia ICOMOS State of the environment 2011 workshop, summary notes DECEMBER 2011] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022175529/http://www.environment.gov.au/soe/2011/report/heritage/pubs/soe2011-supplementary-heritage-icomos-workshop-notes.pdf |date=22 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia ICOMOS also organises an annual national conference on themes relevant to conservation and heritage in Australia and South East Asia, often on a specific heritage and conservation theme for example on the Australian Capital city's 100th anniversary in 2012.&lt;ref name="canberra100.com.au"&gt;[http://www.canberra100.com.au/calendar/view/1942/icomos-national-conference-imagined-pasts-imagined-future/ ICOMOS National Conference, 'Imagined Pasts, Imagined Futures']&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent collaboration between the Chinese government, the Getty Conservation Institute and Australia ICOMOS has seen the export of Australian conservation expertise in developing '''China Principles''', ''...the Middle Kingdom's statement of conservation philosophy and method that is based on Australia's highly regarded Burra Charter''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/selling-heritage-to-china/story-e6frg8n6-1226067465487#sthash.HZJLffKT.dpuf Robert Bevan, 'Selling heritage to China' ''The Australian'' June 02, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; Australia ICOMOS and the Burra Charter have also been held up as a world standard in Malta.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20051218/opinion/conserving-local-heritage-through-heritage-management.68715 Samantha Fabry' Conserving local heritage through heritage management ''Times of Malta'' December 18, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Baronci Altarpiece''''' was a [[painting]] by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[High Renaissance]] artist [[Raphael]]. His first recorded commission, it was made for Andrea Baronci's chapel in the church of Sant'Agostino in [[Città di Castello]], near [[Urbino]]. The [[altarpiece]] was seriously damaged during an earthquake in 1789, and since 1849 fragments of the original painting have been part of different collections.

==History==
On December 10, 1500, Raphael and [[Evangelista da Pian di Meleto]], an older painter from the workshop of Raphael's father [[Giovanni Santi]], received the commission to paint jointly a large altarpiece dedicated to [[Nicholas of Tolentino|Saint Nicholas of Tolentino]], for the Baronci chapel in the Sant'Agostino Church in [[Città di Castello]]. In the documents Raphael, not his collaborator, is referred to as ''magister'' ("master"). The work on the paintings was completed on September 13, 1501.

In the center of the painting Nicholas of Tolentino stood in an archway, with the devil at his feet. Next to him were three angels. Above him [[God the Father]] was placed with a crown in his hand, and surrounded by the heads of angels. On his left the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] and [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] were painted.

During a heavy earthquake in 1789 the painting was damaged so severely that it was decided to saw it into pieces and display only the undamaged parts. In the same year, the fragments were acquired by [[Pope Pius VI]] for the [[Vatican Museums|collections of the Vatican]], where they remained until 1849. It is unclear what happened to them after that. Only many years later scholars were able to trace back six different pieces, four fragments of the main painting and two [[predella]]s, which had become part of different collections.

An impression of the complete work is given by an 18th-century copy in the [[Pinacoteca Comunale, Città di Castello]]. Preliminary sketches by Raphael can be found in the [[Palais des Beaux-Arts|Palais des Beaux-Arts de Lille]], [[Lille]] and the [[Ashmolean Museum]], [[Oxford]]. On the basis of these drawings it is assumed that the design of the altar was entirely Raphael's work, whereas in the execution he was joined by Evangelista da Pian di Meleto. While Raphael probably painted the altarpiece itself, the predellas are attributed to Pian di Meleto.

'''Behnam House''' is a historical building in [[Tabriz]], [[Iran]].

The edifice was built during the later part of the [[Zand dynasty]] (1750–1794) and the early part of the [[Qajar dynasty]] (1781–1925), as a residential house. During the reign of [[Nasereddin Shah|Nasereddin Shah Qajar]] (1848–1896) this building was substantially renovated and embellished with ornamental paintings. The house consists of a main building, referred to as the ''Winter Building'', and a smaller structure, referred to as the ''Summer Building''. The ''Winter Building'' is a two-storey symmetrical construction standing on a basement. Like many traditional houses in Iran, this house has an inner (اندرونی, ''andaruni'') and an outer (بيرونی, ''biruni'') courtyard, the former being the larger of the two. In the course of a 2009 renovation project, some hitherto unknown [[Persian miniature|miniature]] [[fresco]]es were discovered in this house which were restored by specialists. The Behnām House is part of the School of Architecture of [[Tabriz Art University]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2822">The '''Black Arts Council''' (BAC) was an organization founded in 1968 to advocate for African-American artists and support their community.  Founded by [[Cecil Fergerson]] and Claude Booker (black art preparators who worked at the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]], or LACMA), the organization comprised African-American artists, staff members, and other city residents who aimed to promote African-American art in Los Angeles.  When the Black Arts Council was founded in 1968, every LACMA board member was white.&lt;ref name=cooks&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=sxHCWUnRGyQC&amp;pg=PA87#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Cooks].&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization grew to over 1,000 members in two years.&lt;ref name=Holmes&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holmes|first1=Emory|title=A Pit Bull in the World of Fine Art|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/feb/14/magazine/tm-7907|accessdate=14 December 2014|work=Los Angeles Times|date=1999-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It not only pressured LACMA to organize exhibitions for African-American artists, but also did extensive work supporting artists outside the museum.&lt;ref name=Whos&gt;{{cite web|title=Two Centuries of Black American Art at LACMA: Who's Who|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|url=http://www.lacma.org/whos-who|website=LACMA|publisher=LACMA|accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BAC organized student field trips to art exhibits, gave lectures at schools, and curated art exhibitions at various community locations and events.&lt;ref name="Whos" /&gt;

The BAC's advocacy produced results in the form of two LACMA exhibitions: ''Three Graphic Artists: Charles White, [[David Hammons]], and Timothy Washington'' in 1971, and ''Panorama'' in 1972, featuring [[Noah Purifoy]],  [[John Outterbridge]], and [[Betye Saar]].&lt;ref name=Sirmans&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sirmans|first1=Franklin|title=Remembering Cecil Fergerson (1931–2013)|url=http://unframed.lacma.org/2013/09/23/remembering-cecil-fergerson-1931-2013|website=LACMA Unframed|accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These exhibits paved the path for LACMA's 1976 exhibition ''[[Two Centuries of Black American Art]]'', which traveled to the [[High Museum of Art]] in Atlanta, the [[Dallas Museum of Art|Dallas Museum of Fine Arts]], and the [[Brooklyn Museum]].&lt;ref name="Sirmans" /&gt;  

The BAC ceased activities in 1974 following Booker's death.&lt;ref name="Whos" /&gt;

'''''Bugs Bunny Nips the Nips''''' is a 1944 ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' cartoon directed by [[Friz Freleng]].&lt;ref name=bcdb&gt;{{bcdb|3765|Bugs Bunny Nips The Nips}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Somewhere in the Pacific, Bugs is floating in a box, singing to himself, when 'the island that inevitably turns up in this kind of picture' turns up. Bugs swims towards it, and admires the peace and quiet, when bombs start going off ("The Storm" from the ''[[William Tell Overture]]'' is also heard in the background). Bugs ducks into a haystack, and soon comes face to face with a Japanese soldier; a short, buck-toothed, bare-footed Japanese man who says his 'Ls' as 'Rs' and who might be rapidly stating the names of Japanese cities whenever he moves. The soldier chases Bugs to a rabbit hole, where the soldier dumps a bomb inside. However, Bugs manages to blow the soldier up with the bomb. When the soldier tries to swing a sword at Bugs, Bugs appears as a Japanese general (presumably [[Hideki Tojo]]), but is soon recognized by his trademark carrot eating, prompting the soldier (who says he saw Bugs in the "Warner Bros. Leon Schlesinger ''Merrie Melodies'' cartoon pictures", referring to the fact that Bugs was originally exclusive to that series) to ask him "What's up, Honorable Doc?"

Bugs then jumps into a plane and the soldier also jumps into a plane. However, Bugs ties the soldier's plane to a tree, causing the plane to be yanked out from under him. The soldier parachutes down, but is met by Bugs in mid-air, who hands "Moto" (cf. [[Mr. Moto]]) some 'scrap iron' (an [[anvil]]),&lt;ref&gt;This is a reference to US companies selling scrap metal to Japan before the war.&lt;/ref&gt; causing the soldier to fall. Painting a Japanese flag on a tree to denote one soldier down, Bugs runs into a [[sumo wrestler]], whom he confidently faces off against (cockily marking a second bigger flag on the tree). After getting temporarily beaten by the sumo wrestler (and, to be fair, wipes the second mark off the tree before collapsing), Bugs dresses as a [[Geisha|geisha girl]] and knocks the wrestler out, who repaints a second flag on the tree before passing out.

Seeing a bunch of Japanese landing craft making their way to the island (exclaiming "Japs! Hundreds of 'em!"), Bugs thinks of a plan to get rid of all of them. He comes out in a 'Good Rumor' (a parody of [[Good Humor]]) truck, which plays Mozart ("Der Vogelfänger bin ich ja" from ''[[The Magic Flute]]''). Bugs hands each of the Japanese an ice cream bar with a grenade inside it, calling them racist slurs such as "monkey-face" and "slant-eyes" whilst doing so. All the Japanese are killed off from the explosions, save for one who was killed after redeeming a 'free' ice cream bar from Bugs. Having now painted dozens of Japanese flags on the trees denoting all the downed enemy, Bugs comments again about the 'peace and quiet – and if there's one thing I CAN'T stand, it's peace and quiet!'.

Bugs spots an American battleship in the distance and raises a white flag, yelling for them to come get him, but they keep going.  Bugs is insulted. "Do they think I want to spend the rest of my life on this island?" With this remark, a female rabbit (dressed in a more Hawaiian outfit) appears saying, "It's a possibility!"  Bugs then pulls down the distress flag, lets out a wolf cry and goes running after her.

==Analysis==
The films depicting the Japanese enemy during World War II tended to both identify a formidable wartime adversary and to depict said adversary as inferior to its American counterparts. In cartoons, this translated to a tendency to depict the Japanese as either superman or buffoon. This film closer represents the latter tendency.&lt;ref name="Fuller"&gt;Fuller (2001), p. 285-287&lt;/ref&gt; The caricature portrayal of this film serves as a host to well-worn stereotypes.&lt;ref name="Fuller"/&gt;

The film opens with Bugs singing from within a crate.&lt;ref name="Fuller2"&gt;Fuller (2010), p. 138-139&lt;/ref&gt; He is somewhere in the Pacific and is waiting for the inevitable island to turn up.&lt;ref name="Shull"&gt;Shull, Wilt (2004), p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; He then sees an island and swims towards its beach.&lt;ref name="Fuller2"/&gt; Already in the introduction, Bugs identifies his Pacific island setting as a "[[garden of Eden]] and a "[[Shangri-La]]". This in reference to the exotic havens depicted in South Sea island films and to the epic film ''[[Lost Horizon (1937 film)|Lost Horizon]]'' (1937). Only then is Bugs alerted to the mortal danger that awaits him on the island. The seductive first impression serves to set up a hazardous trap.&lt;ref name="Fuller"/&gt;

Bugs escapes rapid gunfire by running for cover into a haystack.&lt;ref name="Fuller2"/&gt; The initial encounter of Bugs with a Japanese soldier presents an optical illusion, that the two share a body. Bugs' head peeks above the haystack, while the legs of the soldier appear below it.&lt;ref name="Fuller"/&gt; Then the owner of the feet confronts Bugs. The soldier has buck teeth, a thin mustache, dark eyeglasses, slanted eyebrows and curly, wavy hair.&lt;ref name="Fuller2"/&gt;

The soldier pulls out a sword and starts swiping at Bugs. He speaks in Oriental-sounding [[gibberish]], consisting of short syllables spoken in a [[staccato]] voice. In response, Bugs assumes the form of a Japanese general and stands stiffly at attention.&lt;ref name="Fuller2"/&gt; Bugs' face is briefly transformed into a Japanese caricature, only to be contrasted with the face of an actual, if impish, Japanese soldier. Bugs disguised as a general imitates photographs of [[Hideki Tojo]].&lt;ref name="Fuller3"&gt;Fuller (2010), p. 141-143&lt;/ref&gt; The soldier bows in supplication to the authority figure. Bugs accidentally gives away his identity by casually chewing on a carrot.&lt;ref name="Fuller2"/&gt;

The soldier resumes use of his sword and talks gibberish again. Bugs takes off in a Japanese plane, followed by the soldier in his own plane.&lt;ref name="Fuller2"/&gt; Both planes are presumably based on the [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]].&lt;ref name="Shull"/&gt; Bugs ties the rival plane to a tree. The soldier parachutes out and Bugs hands him an anvil. Mocking: "Here's some scrap iron for Japan, Moto."&lt;ref name="Fuller2"/&gt; There is a spoken reference to [[Mr. Moto]] to provide a well-acquainted name to the wartime enemy.&lt;ref name="Fuller3"/&gt;

Bugs then bumps into a [[Rikishi|sumo wrestler]]. The man is huge with a large stomach, a mustache, a goatee, buck teeth with a large gap between the front teeth, and a [[Mohawk hairstyle]]. In response, Bugs transforms into a [[geisha]]. He speaks in Japanese-sounding gibberish and coaxes the wrestler into a near kiss. The kiss turns into a fatal blow with a [[mallet]]. Bugs triumphantly shouts "timber" as the man falls.&lt;ref name="Fuller2"/&gt; The [[Masquerade ball|masquerade]] scene involving the wrestler and the geisha makes use of two relatively harmless civilian-type characters to cast the enemy in a humorous light.&lt;ref name="Fuller3"/&gt; In concept, it suggests that an Oriental guise can be put on and discarded at will.&lt;ref name="Fuller3"/&gt;

Bugs then sees several Japanese ships floating towards the island. He is next seen disguised as [[ice cream truck|Ice cream car]] vendor in the mold of the [[Good Humor]] man. He entices many Japanese soldiers to come get their ice cream.&lt;ref name="Fuller2"/&gt; There are many Japanese soldiers besieging Bugs' ice cream truck. Suggesting that their threat relies on their numbers. They are an easily fooled mob, not a group of individuals.&lt;ref name="Fuller"/&gt; They resemble a swarm of bees and they are rendered less as human figures and more like a scourge in need of extermination.&lt;ref name="Fuller3"/&gt;

Bugs insults his customers by calling them "monkey face" and "slant eyes".&lt;ref name="Fuller2"/&gt; The scene with the ice cream track partially obscures the faces and bodies of the enemy soldiers, but Bugs verbalizes a physical description. The phrases "bowlegs", "monkey face", "slant eyes" both serve as racial epithets and audibly support the visualized stereotypes of the film. They are all elements of the Japanese wartime caricature.&lt;ref name="Fuller3"/&gt;

They get served with chocolate-covered ice cream bars embedded with grenades.&lt;ref name="Fuller3"/&gt; The soldiers run off as soon as they get served. Then numerous explosions are heard.&lt;ref name="Fuller2"/&gt; One battered soldier returns to present his specially-marked stick, earning him a free ice cream bar. He is the last one.&lt;ref name="Shull"/&gt; Bugs' mission is accomplished. He then signals an American ship to come get him.&lt;ref name="Fuller2"/&gt;

Bugs hates being confined to a world of "peace and quiet". He celebrates the approach of an American ship and his potential rescue, until he meets a [[sarong]]-clad female bunny.&lt;ref name="Shull"/&gt; The female bunny ignites his passion. He howls and thumps his foot, his eyes bulging from their sockets. He leaps into an amorous pursuit and the film ends.&lt;ref name="Lerner"&gt;Lerner (2010), p. 210-213&lt;/ref&gt;

The short placed an emphasis on physical peculiarities to imply racial inferiority. The preeminent danger is positioned to be treachery and not military might.&lt;ref name="Fuller"/&gt; The Japanese are distinctively [[Othering|othered]] as physically deformed.&lt;ref name="Fuller3"/&gt; The Japanese are characterized as single-minded, subservient to their superiors and gullible. The gag with the ice cream-seeking soldiers makes use of the American perception of the Japanese as both gullible and greedy. Bugs' stereotypical portrayal of Japanese womanhood renders him a meek and seductive creature, speaking in a falsetto voice.&lt;ref name="Brcak"&gt;Brcak, Pavia (2002), p. 221&lt;/ref&gt;

The short has similarities to both ''[[Wackiki Wabbit]]'' (1943) and ''[[Herr Meets Hare]]'' (1945).&lt;ref name="Shull"/&gt; The soundtrack includes ''Trade Winds'' and ''Someone's Rocking My Dreamboat''.&lt;ref name="Shull"/&gt; There are two musical quotations from ''[[Die Walküre]]'' (1870) by [[Richard Wagner]].&lt;ref name="Lerner"/&gt; The Japanese soldiers are repeatedly presented on screen to the tune of the ''[[Kimigayo]]'' (1870)&lt;ref name="Lerner"/&gt; The ice cream truck scene uses the tune of the opening aria of Papageno, from ''[[The Magic Flute]]'' (1791) by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]].&lt;ref name="Lerner2"&gt;Lerner (2010), p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; When Bugs professes his hatred of the peace and quiet, demanding someone to get him out of this place, the tune is the ''[[Ride of the Valkyries]]''.

Neil Lerner attempts to decipher [[Carl Stalling]]'s intentions in quoting Wagner at the end of the battle scenes. He suggests that it is connected to the role of the [[Valkyrie]]s, taking fallen warriors to [[Valhalla]]. In this case, the use is ironic as Stalling would not view the deceased Japanese soldiers as fallen heroes who deserve an afterlife paradise.&lt;ref name="Lerner3"&gt;Lerner (2010), p. 217-218&lt;/ref&gt;

As Bugs signals the American ship, the tune is from the scene where [[Brynhildr|Brünnhilde]] announces her pregnancy.&lt;ref name="Lerner3"/&gt; Lerner suggests that Stalling was inspired by the name of [[Sigurd|Siegfried]], "peace through victory". Stalling could intend the scene to represent the United States reaching such a peace. Alternatively, he might be inspired by the stark isolation of Brünnhilde on a rocky mountain – in which case, the reference would have been Bugs being trapped on the island.&lt;ref name="Lerner4"&gt;Lerner (2010), p. 220&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes==
*Since the 1960s, "Bugs Bunny Nips the Nips" has become very controversial because the short stereotypes against Japanese people. However, the cartoon was not one of the "[[Censored Eleven]]" and was occasionally shown on television in syndicated packages with other pre-August 1948&lt;ref&gt;The latest released WB cartoon sold to a.a.p. was ''[[Haredevil Hare]]'', released on July 24, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; Warner Bros. cartoons whose copyrights were under the ownership of [[Associated Artists Productions]]. The short debuted on home video in December 1991 on [[The Golden Age of Looney Tunes#Volume 1|the first volume of ''Golden Age of Looney Tunes'']] [[laser disc]] collection. The niche market format did not cause a stir, but when the 5-disc set was later issued in the more accessible VHS format on 10 separate tapes in 1993, Japanese groups went against its distribution. Originally, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (the copyright owners of the Turner/Associated Artists Productions shorts at the time) defended against the Japanese groups and did not withdraw the release, but later they changed their minds and both releases were withdrawn. Future releases for both formats replaced the cartoon with ''[[Racketeer Rabbit]]'', which already appeared on another LaserDisc and VHS set. The VHS reissue combined volumes 4 and 7 of the 10-tape set.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1995/02/17/wwii-cartoons-pulled/f190dd30-5da9-4e7a-ba92-52edb9fd2f45/&lt;/ref&gt; After the pulling of the short in 1993 from home video, the short was also pulled from American television networks and has been since.
*This was one of the 12 Bugs Bunny cartoons that were pulled out of Cartoon Network's June Bugs 2001 marathon by order of [[AOL Time Warner]] due to stereotypes of Japanese people. However, in a promo for this event, the scene where Bugs does a double-take on noticing the female rabbit was used.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsz9Kqxx0dg&lt;/ref&gt; This cartoon was shown, albeit in clips, on a special episode of the Cartoon Network show ''[[ToonHeads]]'' about cartoons from the World War II era, while a voiceover explained how Japanese stereotypes in World War II cartoons tended to be very cruel (as shown in Norm MacCabe's ''[[Tokio Jokio]]'', this cartoon and clips of World War II-era [[Popeye]] cartoons).
*This cartoon was made during [[World War II]], and reflects the United States' attitude towards one of its main enemies at the time, the [[Empire of Japan]]. In the cartoon, [[Bugs Bunny]] lands on an island in the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] and is pitted against a group of highly [[Stereotype|racially stereotyped]] Japanese soldiers. Bugs shows no mercy against the Japanese soldiers, greeting them with several [[racial slurs]] such as "monkey face" and "slant eyes", making short work of a large [[sumo wrestler]], and bombing most of the Japanese army using various explosives, including grenades hidden in [[ice cream bar]]s. The cartoon's title is a play on the verb "nip" as in "bite" and "[[Nip]]s", which at the time was a widely used [[List of ethnic slurs|slur]] for Japanese people, as the Japanese word for "Japan" is "Nippon" (or "Nihon").
*The ''[[Film Daily]]'' called the seven-minute short "good fun", and gave the following synopsis:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Bugs Bunny, castaway on a Pacific isle, thinks the setting is ideal until he finds his paradise infested with Japanese soldiers. How he single-handedly exterminates the enemy makes for a laugh-filled few minutes of typical Bugs antics, off-screen remarks and action in this Technicolor cartoon produced by Leon Schlesinger."&lt;ref&gt;"Reviews of New Films," ''The [[Film Daily]]''. 5/10/44. p.13&lt;/ref&gt;

[[image:CK Diagram.png|thumb|A graphical representation of a Design Process using C-K Design Theory.]]

'''C-K design theory''' or '''concept-knowledge theory''' is both a [[design]] theory and a [[theory]] of reasoning in design. It defines design reasoning as a [[Mathematical logic|logic]] of expansion processes, ''i.e.'' a logic that organizes the generation of unknown objects. The theory builds on several traditions of design theory, including [[systematic design]], [[axiomatic design]], [[creativity]] theories, general and formal [[Design#Design approaches and methods|design theories]],&lt;ref name="FDT"&gt;Braha D. and Maimon O. 1998. ''A Mathematical Theory of Design: Foundations, Algorithms, and Applications.'' Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[artificial intelligence]]-based design models. Claims made for C-K design theory include that it is the first design theory that:

# Offers a comprehensive formalization of design that is independent of any design domain or object
# Explains invention, creation, and discovery within the same framework and as design processes.

The name of the theory is based on its central premises: the distinction between two spaces:
*a space of concepts '''C'''
*a space of knowledge '''K'''.

The process of [[design]] is defined as a ''double expansion'' of the C and K spaces through the application of four types of operators: C→C, C→K, K→C, K→K

The first draft of C-K theory was sketched&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hatchuel|first=Armand|year=1996|title=Théories et modèles de la conception, Cours d'ingénierie de la conception|publisher=[[École des Mines de Paris]]|location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [http://www.cgs.ensmp.fr/people/hatchuel/index.html Armand Hatchuel], and then developed by Hatchuel and his colleague, Benoît Weil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hatchuel|first=A|author2=B. Weil|year=2002|title=La théorie C-K : Fondements et usages d'une théorie unifiée de la conception|url=http://www.spatial-computing.org/~michel/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=documents-ro:hatchuelweil2002latheorieck.pdf|publisher=Colloque Sciences de la conception}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent publications explain C-K theory and its practical application in different industries.&lt;ref&gt;Hatchuel A., Le Masson P. &amp; Weil B. (2004), [http://www.cgs.ensmp.fr/ck-theory/HatchuelLeMassonWeil2004DesSocindusappliCKtheoryverB3-versionenvoyee2.pdf C-K Theory in Practice: Lessons from Industrial Applications], 8th International Design Conference, D. Marjanovic, (Ed.), Dubrovnik, 18–21 May 2004: 245&amp;ndash;257.&lt;/ref&gt; C-K theory is a research field and a teaching area in several academic institutions in France, [[Switzerland]], [[Israel]], the UK, the USA, and [[Sweden]].{{lopsided|date=June 2010}}{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

==Genesis of C-K theory==

C-K theory was a response to three perceived limitations of existing design theories:&lt;ref&gt;Hatchuel, A and Weil, B 2003, [http://www.cgs.ensmp.fr/design/docs/HatchuelWeil2003CKICED.pdf A new approach of innovative design: an introduction to C-K theory]. Proceedings of the international conference on engineering design (ICED’03), Stockholm, Sweden, pp 109–124&lt;/ref&gt;

# Design theory when assimilated to [[problem solving]] theory is unable to account for innovative aspects of design.
# Classic design theories dependent on object domains, machine design, architecture or industrial design favored design theories that were tailored to their specific knowledge bases and contexts. Without a unified design theory these fields experience difficulties over cooperation in real design situations.
# Design theories and creativity theories have been developed as separate fields of research. But design theory should include the creative, surprising and serendipitous aspects of design; while creativity theories have been unable to account for intentional inventive processes common in design fields.&lt;ref&gt;Hatchuel, Armand, Le Masson, Pascal, and Weil, Benoit. (2008) [http://www.cgs.ensmp.fr/design/docs/HatchuelLeMassonWeil2008NSFrevised.pdf Studying creative design: the contribution of C-K theory]. Studying design creativity: Design Science, Computer Science, Cognitive Science and Neuroscience Approaches, Aix-en-Provence, France, 10&amp;ndash;11 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

C-K theory claims to have overcome these three limitations.{{lopsided|date=June 2010}} It uses an approach which is domain-independent and which allows acting on unknown objects, and changes of the definitions of known objects during the process (''revision of objects' identities'').&lt;ref name="RED2009"&gt;Hatchuel A. and Weil B., [http://www.springerlink.com/content/u073n68w34548501/ C-K design theory: An advanced formulation], Research in Engineering Design, 19(4):181&amp;ndash;192, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; C-K theory was shown by Hatchuel and Weil&lt;ref name="RED2009"/&gt; to be closely related to Braha's Formal Design Theory &lt;ref name="FDT"/&gt; and its clarification by Braha and Reich’s Coupled Design Theory,&lt;ref&gt;Braha D. and Reich Y. 2003. [http://necsi.edu/affiliates/braha/RED03_Topology.pdf ''Topological Structures for Modeling Complex Engineering Design Processes.''] Research in Engineering Design 14(4): 185-199.&lt;/ref&gt; which are both based on topological structures for design modeling.

==Structure of C-K theory ==
The core idea behind C-K theory is to define rigorously a design situation. A brief is an incomplete description of objects that do not exist yet and are still partly unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eris|first=Ozgur|title=Effective inquiry for innovative engineering design|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first step in C-K theory is to define a brief as a concept, through the introduction of a formal distinction between concept and knowledge spaces; the second step is to characterize the operators that are needed between these two spaces.

===Knowledge===
The knowledge space is defined as a set of propositions with a logical status, according to the knowledge available to the designer or the group of designers. The knowledge space (i.e. K-Space) describes all objects and truths that are established from the point of view of the designer. Then K-Space is expandable as new truths may appear in it as an effect of the design process. Conversely, the structure and properties of the K-Space have a major influence on the process.&lt;ref name="RED2009" /&gt;

===Concept ===
A concept is defined as a proposition without a logical status in the K-Space. A central finding of C-K theory is that concepts are the necessary departure point of a design process. Without concepts, design reduces to standard [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] or [[problem-solving]]. Concepts assert the existence of an unknown object that presents some properties desired by the designer. Concepts can be partitioned or included, but not searched nor explored.&lt;ref name="RED2009" /&gt;

===C-K operators===
Building on these premises, C-K theory shows the design process as the result of four operators: '''C→K''', '''K→C''', '''C→C''', '''K→K'''.

*The initial concept is partitioned using propositions from K: '''K→C'''
*These partitions add new properties to the concepts and create new concepts: '''C→C'''
*Thanks to a conjunction '''C→K''' this expansion of C may in return provoke the expansion of the K space: '''K→K'''

The process can be synthesized through a '''design square'''. One design solution for a first concept '''C0''' will be a path in the '''C'''-space that forms a new proposition in '''K'''. There may exist several design paths for the same '''C0'''.

[[File:Design Square.png|600px|center|The C-K Design Square]]

==Central findings==
The following graphical representation summarises the design process using C-K theory.
[[File:CK Diagram.png|center|border|500px]]

;Crazy concepts
Crazy concepts are concepts that seem absurd as an exploration path in a design process. Both C-K theory and practical applications have shown that crazy concepts can benefit the global design process by adding extra knowledge, not to be used to pursue that "crazy concept" design path, but to be used to further define a more "sensible concept" and lead to its eventual conjunction. The following image is a graphical representation of this process.
[[File:Crazy Concept.png|border|500px|center]]

;Design creativity
The creative aspect of Design results from two distinct expansions: C-expansions which may be seen as "new ideas", and K-expansions which are necessary to validate these ideas or to expand them towards successful designs.&lt;ref name="RED2009" /&gt;

;Unification of design theories
Domain dependent design theories are built on some specific structure of the K-space, either by assuming that some objects have invariant definitions and properties (like in all engineering fields), or by assuming that the K-space presents some stable structure (e.g. that the functions of an object can be defined independently from its technical realization, as in [[systematic design]] theory).

;Theory of design
At [[The Design Society]]'s 2009 International Conference on Engineering Design, an awarded-paper&lt;ref&gt;Shai, O; Reich, Y; Hatchuel, A; and Subrahmanian, E. (2009) [http://www.cgs.ensmp.fr/design/docs/ShaiReichHatchuelSub2009ICEDInfiseddesignCK.pdf Creativity Theories and Scientific Discovery: a Study of C-K Theory and Infused Design.], International Conference on Engineering Design, ICED'09, 24&amp;ndash;27 August 2009, Stanford CA.&lt;/ref&gt; links scientific discovery and design process using C-K theory as a formal framework. It is suggested that a science of design is possible, and complementary to the more traditional [[bounded rationality]].&lt;ref name="simon"&gt;Hatchuel A. &amp; Weil B. (2002), [http://www.cgs.ensmp.fr/ck-theory/HatchuelWeil2002C-Ktheory.pdf C-K Theory: Notions and Applications of a Unified Design Theory], Proceedings of the Herbert Simon International Conference on " Design Sciences ", Lyon: 22&lt;/ref&gt;{{lopsided|date=June 2010}}

;Mathematical modelling
Mathematical approaches to design have been developed since the 1960s by scholars such as [[Christopher Alexander]], Hiroyuki Yoshikawa, Dan Braha and Yoram Reich. They tended to model the dynamic co-evolution between design solutions and requirements. Within the field of engineering design, C-K theory opens new modelling directions that explore connections with basic issues in logic and mathematics; these are different from the classic use of scientific models in design. It has been argued&lt;ref name="forcing2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hatchuel|first=Armand|author2=B. Weil|title=Design as Forcing: Deepening the foundations of Ck theory|place=16th International Conference on Engineering Design|year=2007|url=http://www.cgs.ensmp.fr/design/docs/Hatchuel-Weil-ICED07paperVdef21.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; that C-K theory has analogies with [[Forcing (mathematics)|forcing]] in [[set theory]], and with [[intuitionistic]] mathematics.&lt;ref name="kazakci2009"&gt;Kazakci, Akin, and Hatchuel, Armand,[http://www.cgs.ensmp.fr/design/docs/Kazakci.Intuitionism.Brouwer.ICED09.pdf Is "creative subject" of Brouwer a designer? &amp;ndash; an Analysis of Intuitionistic Mathematics from the Viewpoint of C-K Design Theory?], International Conference on Engineering Design, ICED'09, Stanford CA, 24&amp;ndash;27 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Industrial applications
C-K theory has been applied in several industrial contexts since 1998, mainly in France, [[Sweden]] and Germany. It is generally used as a method that increases the innovative capacity of design and [[Research and development|R&amp;D departments]].{{lopsided|date=June 2010}}{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} C-K theory has also inspired new management principles for collaborative innovation, with the aim of overcoming the limitations of standard design management methods.&lt;ref&gt;Hatchuel, A. ; Le Masson, P. and Weil, B. (2009) [http://www.cgs.ensmp.fr/design/docs/HatchuelLeMassonWeil2009CKKCPv3.pdf Design Theory and Collective Creativity: a Theoretical Framework to Evaluate KCP Process]. International Conference on Engineering Design, ICED'09, 24&amp;ndash;27 August 2009, Stanford CA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elmquist, M. and Segrestin, B. (2009). "Sustainable development through innovative design: lessons from the KCP method experimented with an automotive firm."&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Centenary of Western Australia Women's Suffrage Memorial''' is located in the Western Australia Botanic Garden, within [[Kings Park, Western Australia|Kings Park]] in [[Perth, Western Australia]]. It commemorates the hundredth anniversary of women achieving the right to vote equally with men in Western Australian elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://womenshistory.net.au/2010/07/26/centenary-of-wa-womens-suffrage-memorial/|title=Centenary of WA Women’s Suffrage Memorial|last=AWHF|website=Australian Women's History Forum|access-date=2016-03-11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311131254/http://womenshistory.net.au/2010/07/26/centenary-of-wa-womens-suffrage-memorial/|archivedate=2016-03-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The memorial was commissioned during plans for commemorating the centenary of women's suffrage in Western Australia, and was designed by artist Tony Jones.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://monumentaustralia.org.au/themes/culture/community/display/102021-centenary-of-women%2560s-suffrage-|title=Centenary of Women`s Suffrage Monument Australia|last=Design|first=UBC Web|website=monumentaustralia.org.au|access-date=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was constructed by students from the Western Australia School of Art and Design and installed in 1999.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Queen Sembiyan Mahadevi as the Goddess Parvati (915582657).jpg|thumb|[[Chola bronze]] of Queen Sembiyan Mahadevi as the Goddess [[Parvati]]]]
The period of the imperial [[Cholas]] (c. 850 CE - 1250 CE) was an age of continuous improvement and refinement of Dravidian art and architecture. They utilised their prodigious wealth earned through their extensive conquests in building long-lasting stone temples and exquisite bronze sculptures.

== Introduction ==
The chola temples were built during chola rule.The Cholas built their temple in the traditional way of the [[Pallava]] dynasty, who were themselves influenced by the Amaravati school of architecture. The Chola artists and artisans further drew their influences from other contemporary art and architectural schools and elevated the Dravidian temple design to greater heights.&lt;ref name="tri479"&gt;Tripathi, p 479&lt;/ref&gt; The Chola kings built numerous temples throughout their kingdom, which normally comprised the  plains, Central and Northern Tamil Nadu and at times the entire state of Tamil Nadu as also adjoining parts of modern Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. In the evolution of the Chola temple architecture we can roughly see three major phases, beginning with  the early phase, starting with [[Vijayalaya Chola]] and continuing till Sundara Chola, the middle phase of [[Rajaraja Chola]] and [[Rajendra Chola]] when the achievements scaled heights never reached before or since and the final phase during the [[Chalukya Chola]] period of [[Kulottunga Chola I]] till the demise of the Chola empire.

The Cholas in addition to their temples, also built many  buildings such as hospitals, public utility buildings and palaces. Many such buildings find mention in their inscriptions and in contemporary accounts. The golden palace that [[Aditya Karikala]] supposedly built for his father [[Parantaka Chola II|Sundara Chola]] is an example of such a building. However, such buildings were of perishable materials such as timber and fired bricks and have not survived the ravages of time.

===Early Chola Period===
[[Pallavas]] were the first recognisable South Indian dynasty who indulged in the pursuit of architectural innovations. The first seeds of Dravidian temple architecture in Tamil Nadu were possibly sown during this period. The temple architecture evolved from the early cave temples and monolith temples of [[Mamallapuram]] to the Kailasanatha and Vaikuntaperumal temples of Kanchipuram. This architecture style formed the foundation from which the Cholas, who were in close contact with the Pallavas during their periods of decline,  took some valuable lessons according to Nilakanta Sastri, in his ''A History of South India"

[[File:vijayala choleswaram.png|thumb|left|Vijayalaya Choleswaram]] 
The early Cholas built numerous temples. [[Aditya I]] and [[Parantaka I]] were prolific builders for their faith. Inscriptions of Aditya I record that he built a number of temples along the banks of the river Kaveri. These temples were much smaller in comparison to the huge monumental structures of the later Cholas and were probably brick structures rather than stone.

The Vijayalacholeswaram near [[Pudukkottai]] in [[Tamil Nadu]] is an example of a surviving early Chola building. The style of this structure clearly shows Pallava influences in the design. It has an unusual arrangement of a circular [[garba griha]] (where the deity resides) within a square ''[[parikrama|prakara]]'' - circumbulatory corridor. Above this rises the ''[[vimana (tower)|vimana]]'' or the tower in four diminishing storeys of which the lower three are square and the top circular. Each level is separated from the next by a cornice. The whole structure is surmounted by a dome which in turn is topped with a stone ''kalasa'' - a crest. Very faint traces of paintings can be seen inside on the walls. These paintings are dated not earlier than the 17th century.  The little temple of Nageswara at [[Kumbakonam]] is also of the same period.

The Koranganatha Temple at Srinivasanallur near [[Hirapalli]] is an example of the period of Parantaka I. This temple is situated on the banks of the river Kaveri, and is a small temple with beautiful sculptures on every surface. The base of the wall has a row of sculpted mythical animals that were a unique feature of Chola architecture. The first floor is made of bricks which have been plastered.

Muvarkovil Temple  in the Pudukkottai area was built by a feudatory of Parantaka Chola II during the second half of the tenth century. As the name suggests, the temple complex has three main shrines standing side by side in a row, along the north-south direction, facing west. Out of these three, only two, the central and southern ''vimanams'' (towers) are now extant. Of the third or the northern shrine, the basement alone remains. The architectural style of these shrines exhibit clear concordance with the later Chola temples.&lt;ref&gt;Nilakanta Sastri, ''A History of South India'', p420&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval Period===
Temple building received great impetus from the conquests and the genius of Rajaraja Chola and his son [[Rajendra Chola I]].&lt;ref&gt;Vasudevan, pp21–24&lt;/ref&gt; A number of smaller shrines were built during the early phase of this period. Notable amongst these is the Tiruvalisvaram temple near [[Tirunelveli]]. The temple is covered with exquisite well composed sculptures and friezes some containing comic figures. The entire cornice of the temple tower is embellished with designs of creepers and foliage. Other examples of such temples can be seen at the Vaidyanatha Temple at Tirumalavadi and the Uttara Kailasa Temple at [[Thanjavur]].&lt;ref name=sastri421&gt;Nilakanta Sastri, ''A History of South India'', p421&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:thanjavur temple.jpg|thumb|Detail of the main gopura (tower) of the Thanjavur Temple]]

The maturity and grandeur to which the Chola architecture had evolved found expression in the two magnificent temples of Thanjavur and Gangaikondacholapuram.&lt;ref name=sastri387&gt;Nilakanta Sastri, ''A History of South India'', p387&lt;/ref&gt; The magnificent [[Brihadisvara Temple|Siva temple of Thanjavur]], completed around 1009 CE is a fitting memorial to the material achievements of the time of Rajaraja.&lt;ref name=sastri422&gt;Nilakanta Sastri, ''A History of South India'', p422&lt;/ref&gt; The largest and tallest of all Indian temples, it is a masterpiece constituting the high-water mark of [[South Indian architecture]].&lt;ref name=sastri422/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keay, p216&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vasudevan, p45&lt;/ref&gt;

It is in this temple that one notices for the first time two ''[[gopura]]s'' (towers oriented in the same direction). They are architecturally coeval with the main [[Vimana (tower)|vimana]] and are referred to in inscriptions as ''Rajarajan tiruvasal'' and ''Keralantakan tiruvasal''. In spite of the massive size of the ''gopuras'', the ''vimana'', rising majestically to a height of 190 feet, continues to dominate and it is only in the subsequent period that a change in the gradation of magnitude takes place.

Epigraphic evidence reveals that Rajaraja started building this temple in his 19th regnal year and it was completed on 275th day of his 25th regnal year (1010 CE), taking only 6 years.&lt;ref name=geeta44&gt;Vasudevan, p44&lt;/ref&gt; '''Rajaraja named this temple as Rajarajesvaram''' and the deity Shiva in Linga form as '''Peruvudaiyar''', the temple is also known in the deity's name as '''Peruvudaiyarkovil'''. In later period Maratha and Nayaks rulers constructed various shrines and gopurams of the temple. In later period when the Sanskrit language was more popular during the Maratha rule the temple was named in Sanskrit as Brihadisvaram and the deity as Brihadisvara.

This temple carries on its walls the engraved evidence of the elaborate administrative and financial procedures concerning the day-to-day administration of the temple. The inscriptions give, apart from a comprehensive history of the times, a full enumeration of all the metallic images set up in the temple. Numbering about sixty-six, these icons are referred to with a description of the minutest details of size, shape and composition. This alone is a mine of information for the art historian.

The temple stands within a fort, whose walls are later additions built in the 16th century by the [[Nayaks of Tanjore]].&lt;ref&gt;Jagadisa Ayyar, p424&lt;/ref&gt; The towering ''vimanam'' is about 200 feet in height and is referred to as '''Dakshina Meru''' (Southern Mountain). The octagonal ''Shikharam'' (crest) rests on a single block of granite weighing 81 tons.&lt;ref name=tri479/&gt;&lt;ref name=geeta44/&gt; It is believed that this block was carried up a specially built ramp built from a site 6 kilometres away from the temple. Huge [[Nandi (bull)|Nandis]] (figures of the sacred bull) dot the corners of the Shikharam, and the Kalasam on top by itself is about 3.8 metres in height. Hundreds of [[stucco]] figures bejewel the Vimanam, although it is possible that some of these may have been added on during the Maratha period. The main deity is a [[lingam]] and is a huge, set in a two storeyed sanctum, and the walls surrounding the sanctum delight visitors as a storehouse of [[murals]] and sculptures. The temple is built entirely of [[granite]] in a place where there is no source of granite.&lt;ref name=geeta44/&gt;
[[File:gangaikonda cholapuram.png|thumb|left|gangaikonda cholapuram]] &lt;ref name=tri479/&gt;&lt;ref name=sastri423&gt;Nilakanta Sastri, ''A History of South India'', p423&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sastri5&gt;Nilakanta Sastri, ''A History of South India'', p5&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the temple of Gangaikonda Cholapuram follows the plan of the great temple of Thanjavur in most details it has characteristics of its own. From the remains it may be seen that it had only one enclosure wall and a ''gopura'' while the Thanjavur temple has two gopuras and enclosures. It is larger in plan though not as tall, the ''vimana'' being 100 feet square at the base and 186 feet high. The temple, which forms a large rectangle 340 feet long and 110 feet wide occupies the middle of an immense walled enclosure mainly built for defensive purposes. The ''vimana'' has the same construction as in Thanjavur, but the number of tiers making up the pyramidal body is only eight as against 13 in Thanjavur. The most important difference lies in the introduction of curves in the place of the strong straight lines of the Thanjavur ''vimana''. The pyramidal body is slightly concave in its outline at its angles while the sides are curved to produce a somewhat convex outline. These curves enhance the beauty of form of the ''vimana'' though they distract from its stateliness and power.&lt;ref&gt;Nilakanta Sastri, ''A History of South India'', pp423–424&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jagadisa Ayyar, p293–294&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later Period===
[[File:Chariot spoked wheel Darasuram.jpg|thumb|Spoked chariot wheel, Airavateswarar Temple, Darasuram c. 1200 C.E. The horse-drawn chariot is carved on the front of the ''mandapam''. The chariot and its wheel are so finely sculpted that they include even the faintest details]]

The Chola style continued to flourish for a century longer and expressed itself in a very large number of temples. Of these two large temples are worthy of comparison to those of Rajaraja and Rajendra.

The [[Airavateswara temple]] at [[Darasuram]] near Thanjavur built during the reign of [[Rajaraja Chola II]] is a magnificent structure typical of the stage of architectural development reached in the 12th century CE. This temple has artistic stone pillars and decorations on its walls, in a style bordering on mannerism, with an emphasis on elongated limbs and polished features. Best among them are the dark black basalt figures in the temple niches of Dakshinamurti, the image on the southern side of Shiva in a teaching attitude, and to the west, Shiva erupting out of the pillar of light to convince Brahma and Vishnu of his superiority. The front mandapam is in the form of a huge chariot drawn by horses.&lt;ref name=sastri424&gt;Nilakanta Sastri, ''A History of South India'', pp424–425&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jagadisa Ayyar, p349–353&lt;/ref&gt;

The final example of this period is the [[Kampaheswarar Temple, Thirubuvanam|Kampaheswarar temple]] at Tribhuvanam near [[Kumbakonam]] which has survived in good repair as built by [[Kulothunga Chola III]].&lt;ref name=sastri424/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chopra ''et al.'', p 129&lt;/ref&gt; The architecture of this temple is similar to the temples at Tanjore, Gangaikondacholapuram and Darasuram.&lt;ref&gt;Jagadisa Ayyar, p316&lt;/ref&gt;'''

== Sculpture and bronzes ==
[[File:Ornamented pillar Darasuram.jpg|thumb|left|With heavily ornamented pillars accurate in detail and richly sculpted walls, the Airavateswara temple at Darasuram is a classic example of Chola art and architecture]]
[[File:bronze siva.png|thumb|Chola Bronze icon. Shiva and Parvathi c. 1200 C.E.]]

The Chola period is also remarkable for its sculptures and bronzes.&lt;ref&gt;Chopra ''et al.'', p 186&lt;/ref&gt; Among the existing specimens in the various [[museums]] of the world and in the temples of South India, may be seen many fine figures of Siva in various forms accompanied by his consort [[Parvati]] and the other gods, demigods and goddesses of the Saivaite pantheon, [[Vishnu]] and his consort [[Lakshmi]], the Nayanmars, other Saiva saints and many more.&lt;ref name=tri479/&gt; Though conforming generally to the iconographic conventions established by long tradition, the sculptor could also exercise his imagination within the boundaries of the canonical Hindu iconography and worked in greater freedom during the eleventh and the twelfth centuries. As a result, the sculptures and bronzes show classic grace, grandeur and taste. The best example of this can be seen in the form of [[Nataraja]], the Divine Dancer.

===Purpose of the Icons===
While the stone sculpture and the inner sanctum image empowering the temple remained immovable, changing religious concepts during the period around the 10th century demanded that the deities take part in a variety of public roles similar to those of a human monarch. As a result, large bronze images were created to be carried outside the temple to participate in daily rituals, processions, and temple festivals. The round lugs and holes found on the bases of many of these sculptures are for the poles that were used to carry the heavy images. The deities in bronze who participated in such festivities were sumptuously clothed and decorated with precious jewellery. Their every need and comfort were catered to by a battery of temple priests, musicians, cooks, devadasis, administrators and patrons. The lay public thronged the processional route to have a darshan and admired their beloved deity for the lavish depiction of the figure and the grand costumes and jewelry.

[[File:Raraja detail.png|thumb|Detail of a Statue of [[Rajaraja Chola I]] at the Brihadisvara Temple]]
Although bronze casting has a long history in south India, a much larger and a much greater number of bronze sculptures in all sizes ranging from massive to miniature were cast during the Chola period than before, further attesting to the importance of bronze sculpture during this period. It should be noted that when in worship, these images are bedecked in silk costumes, garlands, and gem encrusted jewels, befitting the particular avatar and religious context. Decorating temple bronzes in this way is a tradition at least a thousand years old and such decorations are referred to in 10th-century Chola inscriptions.

In recent times, many of these priceless Chola bronzes have been stolen from their temples or museums, smuggled out of India and have found their way into the private museums of art collectors.

===Lost wax technique===
Chola period bronzes were created using the [[Lost-wax casting|lost wax technique]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolpert p.158&lt;/ref&gt; It is known in artistic terms as "Cire Perdue". The Sanskrit Shilpa texts call it the ''Madhu Uchchishtta Vidhana''.

[[Beeswax]] and ''kungilium'' (a type of [[camphor]]) are mixed with a little oil and kneaded well. The figure is sculpted from this mixture fashioning all the minute details. This is the wax model original.

The entire figure is then coated with clay made from termite hills until the mould is of a necessary thickness. Then the whole thing is dried and fired in an oven with cow-dung cakes. The wax model melts and flows out, while some of it vapourises.

The metal alloy of bronze is melted and poured into the empty clay-mould. This particular bronze alloy is known as ''Pancha Loham''. When the metal has filled all crevices and has settled and hardened and cooled, the mould is broken off. The bronze figure thus obtained is then cleaned, finer details are added, blemishes are removed, smoothened, and polished well. Hence each bronze icon is unique and the mould cannot be used to create copies.

===Elegant Style===
The forms of Chola bronzes are very plastic. They are devoid of intricate ornaments and designs in comparison with the subsequent bronzes of the Vijayanagar and Nayaka period. There is gentle grace, a restrained and quiet elegance, an ethereal, out-worldly beauty, and above all else - a life that throbs and pulsates and thereby enlivens the bronze sculpture. By means of  the facial expressions, the gestures or ''mudras'' the overall body posture and other accompanying bronzes we can imagine the surroundings and the religious context of the figure of the god or goddess; what instrument or weapon he or she is holding; what he or she is leaning on; and what he or she is doing or about to do.

For example, in the ''Rishabaandhika'' or the ''Vrishabavahana murthy'' pose, we see Shiva standing with one leg youthfully crossed across the other and his arm elegantly flexed and raised as if resting or leaning on something. In this elegant posture, it can be surmised that the youthful and athletic Shiva is leaning on his bull-vahana, Nandhi, on whose shoulders He is resting His arm.

[[File:NatarajaMET.JPG|thumb|left|[[Bronze]] [[Chola]] Statue of ''[[Nataraja]]'' at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York City]]

The most famous of all the bronze icons is that of ''Nataraja'' or Adavallar.&lt;ref&gt;Wolpert, p174&lt;/ref&gt; The symbolism presents [[Shiva]] as lord of the [[cosmos|cosmic]] dance of [[creation myth|creation]] and [[wikt:destroy|destruction]]. He is active, yet aloof, like the gods on the [[Parthenon Frieze]]. Surrounding Shiva, a circle of flames represents the [[universe]], whose fire is held in Shiva's left rear palm. His left front arm crosses his chest, the hand pointing in "elephant trunk" position (''gaja hasta'') to his upraised left foot, which signifies liberation. His right foot tramples the dwarf ''Apasmara'', who represents [[ignorance]].

Shiva's right front hand is raised in the "fear-not" gesture of benediction (''abhaya mudra''), while his right rear hand holds a drum with which he beats the measure of the dance. The [[snake]], an emblem of Siva, curls around his arm. His hair holds the crescent [[moon]] - another emblem - and a small image of [[Ganges]], the river-goddess whose precipitous fall from heaven to earth is broken by Siva's matted locks.

Shiva as Nataraja or Adavallar is also accompanied by his consort Sivakami.

==Museum holdings==
Notable collections of the bronzes are held by the museum inside the [[Thanjavur Maratha Palace]], the [[Government Museum, Chennai]], [[Pondicherry Museum]], and [[Indian Museum, Kolkata]].  Outside India, Chola bronze sculptures  are owned by the [[British Museum]], New York's [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], the [[Norton Simon Museum]], in [[Pasadena]], and the [[Asian Art Museum (San Francisco)|Asian Art Museum]] in San Francisco.

==Chola frescoes==
[[File:chola fresco.png|thumb|Chola Fresco of Dancing girls. Brihadisvara Temple c. 1100 C.E.]]
In 1931, Chola frescoes were discovered within the circumambulatory corridor of the Brihadisvara Temple, by S.K. Govindasamy, a professor at the [[Annamalai University]]. These are the first Chola paintings discovered. The passage of the corridor is dark and the walls on either side are covered with two layers of paintings from floor to ceiling.

Researchers have discovered the technique used in these frescoes. A smooth batter of limestone mixture is applied over the stones, which took two to three days to set. Within that short span, such large paintings were painted with natural organic pigments.

[[File:Big Temple-Lingam Painting.jpg|thumb|Another fresco found in the Brihadisvara Temple]]
During the [[Thanjavur Nayak|Nayak]] period, the Chola paintings were painted over. The Chola frescos lying underneath have an ardent spirit of [[saivism]] expressed in them. They probably synchronised with the completion of the temple by Rajaraja Chola.

==Other crafts==
The art of making ornaments of gold and precious stones had reached an advanced stage about the beginning of the 11th century. A large number of ornaments are mentioned in the Thanjavur inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;See ''South Indian Inscriptions'', Vol 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Clayburn Pottery''' was an English pottery works based in Milner St, [[Hanley, Staffordshire|Hanley]], [[Stoke-on-Trent]].

==History==
The company was established in 1953 and ceased trading by 1960. The Clayburn pottery produced hand painted decorative wares such as lamp bases, small bowls, jugs and cruet sets. These were complementary to the products of the [[Midwinter Pottery]], and Clayburn was established by William Lunt, who was a director of Midwinter. This link was strengthened by the arrival of Roy Midwinter as another director of the company.

Many of the designs Clayburn produced were similar to those of the Midwinter Pottery, and were intended to sell alongside them. Examples include lamp bases that matched a Midwinter dinner service. In particular, the Midwinter Pottery designer [[Jessie Tait]] produced versions of her Fiesta, Prima Vera and Tropicana designs for Clayburn.

The aim of the directive is "to harmonise the existing diverging national laws [within the EU] on the protection against the misappropriation of trade secrets, so that companies can exploit and share their trade secrets with privileged business partners across the [[Internal Market]], turning their innovative ideas into growth and jobs".&lt;ref&gt;European Commission, [http://ec.europa.eu/growth/industry/intellectual-property/trade-secrets/index_en.htm Trade Secrets], accessed 3 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

EU member states are required to "bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive" within two years i.e. by May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CONSIL:PE_76_2015_INIT&amp;from=EN Article 19.1 of the Directive]&lt;/ref&gt; Trade secret holders will be entitled to apply for remedies following cases of illegal appropriation of documents, objects, materials, substances or electronic files containing the trade secret or from which the trade secret can be deduced.&lt;ref&gt;Bird and Bird, [http://www.twobirds.com/en/news/articles/2015/uk/latest-news-on-the-trade-secrets-directive Latest News on the Trade Secrets Directive], accessed 3 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Elder Michaux''''' was a religious TV show on the [[DuMont Television Network]], hosted by evangelist [[Lightfoot Solomon Michaux]] (1885–1969).

==Broadcast history==
The show was 30 minutes long, originated as a local program on DuMont station [[WTTG]] in [[Washington, D. C.]] in 1947, and aired on the DuMont network from October 17, 1948 to January 9, 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |title=Appendix One: Programs (A-L) |publisher=Dumont Television Network Historical Web Site |date= |url=http://www.dumonthistory.tv/a1.html |accessdate=2009-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216055809/http://dumonthistory.tv/a1.html |archivedate=2009-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the book ''The Forgotten Network'' by David Weinstein (Temple University Press, 2004), the series also continued locally on WTTG after the network run ended, running to 1951 (see page 162).

The program was among the earliest U.S. television shows with an [[African American]] host, and included religious music and preaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author =Jay Handelman | title =Despite occasional successes, television has failed to embrace diversity | publisher =Sarasota Herald Tribune | date =February 1, 2000 | url =http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-27747839_ITM | accessdate=2009-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''folk dance''' is developed by people that reflect the life of the people of a certain country or region. Not all ethnic dances are folk dances. For example, [[ritual dance]]s or dances of ritual origin are not considered to be folk dances. Ritual dances are usually called "Religious dances" because of their purpose.
The terms "ethnic" and "traditional" are used when it is required to emphasize the cultural roots of the dance. In this sense, nearly all folk dances are ethnic ones. If some dances, such as [[polka]], cross ethnic boundaries and even cross the boundary between "folk" and "ballroom dance", ethnic differences are often considerable enough to mention.
==Background==
They share some or all of the following attributes:

*Dances are usually held at folk dance gatherings or social functions by people with little or no professional training, often to traditional music.
*Dances not generally designed for public performance or the stage, though they may later be arranged and set for stage performances.
*Execution dominated by an inherited tradition from various international cultures rather than innovation (though folk traditions change over time).
*New dancers often learn informally by observing others or receiving help from others.
More controversially, some people define folk dancing as dancing for which there is no governing body or dancing for which there are no competitive or professional institutions. The term "folk dance" is sometimes applied to dances of historical importance in European culture and history; typically originating before the 20th century. For other cultures the terms "ethnic dance" or "traditional dance" are sometimes used, although the latter terms may encompass [[ceremonial dance]]s.

There are a number of modern dances, such as hip hop dance, that evolve spontaneously, but the term "folk dance" is generally not applied to them, and the terms "street dance" or "vernacular dance" are used instead. The term "folk dance" is reserved for dances which are to a significant degree bound by tradition and originated in the times when the distinction existed between the dances of "common folk" and the dances of the modern ballroom dances originated from folk ones.

{{div col end}}
Sword dances include Longsword dances and rapper dancing. Some [[choreographed]] dances such as [[contra dance]], [[Scottish country dance]], and [[modern Western square dance]], are called folk dances, though this is not true in the strictest sense. [[Country dance]] overlaps with contemporary folk dance and ballroom dance. Most country dances and ballroom dances originated from folk dances, with gradual refinement over the years.

People familiar with folk dancing can often determine what country a dance is from even if they have not seen that particular dance before. Some countries' dances have features that are unique to that country, although neighboring countries sometimes have similar features.  For example, the [[Germany|German]] and [[Austria]]n [[Schuhplattler|schuhplattling dance]] consists of slapping the body and shoes in a fixed pattern, a feature that few other countries' dances have.

Folk dances sometimes evolved long before current political boundaries, so that certain dances are shared by several countries.  For example, some Serbian, Bulgarian, and Croatian dances share the same or similar dances, and sometimes even use the same name and music for those dances.

[[International folk dance]] groups exist in cities and college campuses in many countries, in which dancers learn folk dances from many cultures for recreation.

[[Balfolk]] events are [[social dance]] events with live music in Western and Central Europe, originating in the folk revival of the 1970s and becoming more popular since about 2000, where popular European partner dances from the end of the 19th century such as the [[schottische]], [[polka]], [[mazurka]] and [[waltz]] are danced, with additionally other European folk dances, mainly from France, but also from Sweden, Spain and other countries.

'''''Her Sister's Secret''''' is a 1946 [[drama (genre)|drama]] film directed by [[Edgar G. Ulmer]] and starring [[Nancy Coleman]], [[Margaret Lindsay]], [[Phillip Reed]], and [[Regis Toomey]]. It centers around a woman who falls in love with a soldier.  Believing she has been abandoned, she gives her baby to her married sister. The picture was produced and distributed by [[Producers Releasing Corporation]]. The screenplay was by Anne Green from the novel ''Dark Angel'' by [[Gina Kaus]].

==Plot==
During [[World War II]], Toni Dubois meets soldier Dick Connolly at Pepe's. They have breakfast there the following day, and Dick proposes to Toni, who decides to wait until six weeks have passed before meeting again to see if they truly love each other. However, during the six weeks pause, Dick's [[leave (military)|leave]] gets canceled, and Toni believes she was a [[one night stand]] because the letter he wrote to her explaining his leave situation becomes lost. Toni decides to visit her sister Renee, who is married to Bill Gordon. When Bill is shipped overseas, Toni reveals she is pregnant from her one night with Dick. As Renee and Bill are unable to have their own child, Renee asks if she can have the baby and tell Bill it is hers. Toni gives birth to a boy, who Renee names Billy. Renee takes the child and Toni agrees not to see little Billy for another three years.

Two years later, Toni stays home with her ill father, Mr. Dubois. Mr. Dubois tells her to not stay home when he dies. When he passes, Toni leaves and heads to Renee's, where she learns from housemaid Etta that Bill and Renee have gone out of town for a while. Toni attempts to take Billy away but Etta stops her. When Bill and Renee return home, Etta tells them of what happened. Meanwhile, Dick is discharged from the army, and he comes to Renee's house looking for Toni. After he leaves, Renee tells Toni that Dick was at her house. Toni insists upon taking Billy back, but Renee refuses, stating that Billy has become her son after two years. Toni tries to take Billy away again, but Billy runs away from Toni in fear, causing Toni to accept that Bill and Renee will raise Billy. Bill reveals that he knew the truth about Billy's birth, and thanks Toni for allowing them to raise him.

==Production==
Directed by [[Edgar G. Ulmer]], ''Her Sister's Secret'' was produced by Henry Brash and written by Anne Green. It is based on the novel "Dark Angel" by [[Gina Kaus]].&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|title=Her Sister's Secret - At the Gotham|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F00E5DC163CE13BBC4B51DFB766838C659EDE|accessdate=June 4, 2014|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 23, 1947}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working titles for the film were ''Between Two Sisters'' and ''Once and For All''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Her Sister's Secret - Notes|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/77815/Her-Sister-s-Secret/notes.html|website=[[Turner Classic Movies]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was produced by [[Producers Releasing Corporation]]. They increased their usual film budget for ''Her Sister's Secret'', referring to it as their "first million-dollar production" in advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Her Sister's Secret - TCM Classic Film Festival |url=http://filmfestival.tcm.com/programs/films/her-sisters-secret/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140604215433/http://filmfestival.tcm.com/programs/films/her-sisters-secret/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 4, 2014 |website=[[Turner Classic Movies]] |accessdate=June 4, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release and reception==
[[Producers Releasing Corporation]] released the film in September 1946.{{sfn|Ramsaye|1954|p=729}}

''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote of the film, "In fashioning ''Her Sister's Secret'' as their first million-dollar production, the film makers at PRC may have been imbued with the theory that soap operas not only affect a lot of people but also sell soap and make money. For the romantic drama, which came to the Gotham yesterday, follows the pattern set by many of those lachrymose radio offerings" and said that "The sets of "Her Sister's Secret" are neat and interesting, attributes, which, sadly enough, can hardly be applied to its story."&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; A reviewer for the Northwest Chicago Film Society opined the film was "a superb melodrama" and that "you won’t soon forget ''Her Sister’s Secret''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Don't Miss This One: Her Sister's Secret|url=http://www.northwestchicagofilmsociety.org/2011/11/14/dont-miss-this-one-her-sisters-secret/|website=Northwest Chicago Film Society|accessdate=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Brody of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' remarked that "the actors are hardly charismatic, but Ulmer, capturing their frozen energy in the shifting perspective of daringly long takes, infuses them with his rhapsodically compassionate vision." Brody also wrote that "Edgar G. Ulmer cuts loose with a wild creativity that yoked his theatrical imagination to a keen view of the traumatic times," and that Ulmer "wrings the last drop of true emotion from every soap-operatic twist, while also baring the domestic scars of war’s violence, sacrifice, and, above all, silence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brody|first1=Richard|title=Her Sister's Secret|url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/reviews/film/her_sisters_secret_ulmer|accessdate=June 4, 2014|work=[[The New Yorker]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonard Maltin]] gave the film two and a half stars, saying that it was a "fair weeper with competent cast."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maltin|first1=Leonard|title=Her Sister's Secret|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/77815/Her-Sister-s-Secret/|website=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|accessdate=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, the film was banned in [[Ireland]] by [[Richard Hayes (politician)|Richard Hayes]] for featuring an [[Single parent#Unintended pregnancy|unwed mother]], a decision which was eventually reversed by the Appeal Board.{{sfn|Rockett|Rockett|2004|p=117}} This reversal was described by Irish film historian [[Kevin Rockett]] as "an indication of the slightly more flexible approached being adopted in the post-war years by the Appeal Board."{{sfn|Rockett|Rockett|2004|p=117}}

==Preservation==
The film was restored by the [[UCLA Film &amp; Television Archive]], with funding provided by The Film Foundation and [[The Franco-American Cultural Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cinema.ucla.edu/events/2015/03/14/her-sisters-secret-exile-express |title=Her Sister's Secret [programme note] |publisher=UCLA Film &amp; Television Archive |year=2015 |accessdate=2016-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A fine-grain was recently struck from the original nitrate negative, from which a new negative and superb new print were produced.  Among other earlier exhibitions, the new print was exhibited at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in [[New York City]] in November 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moma.org/calendar/events/567?locale=en |publisher=MoMA |title=Her Sister's Secret [programme note] |year=2014 |accessdate=2016-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hercules' Dog Discovers Purple Dye''''' or '''''The Discovery of Purple by Hercules' Dog''''' is an oil painting by [[Flemish]] artist [[Peter Paul Rubens]] painted circa 1636, towards the end of his career.  It depicts the mythical discovery of [[Tyrian purple]] by [[Hercules]] and his dog, and was one of dozens of oil on panel sketches made by Rubens for the decoration of the [[Torre de la Parada]] in Spain.  A completed painting based on Rubens' sketch was made by [[Theodoor van Thulden]] in 1636-8, and is now held by the [[Prado Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/art-work/el-descubrimiento-de-la-purpura/57d12ff8-e9f2-4703-94e6-6e182b539df9 Prado] (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens - La découverte de la pourpre - detail.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Detail showing the dog with what appears to be a [[nautilus]] rather than a [[Bolinus brandaris|dye murex]]]]
The painting shows a scene from an [[origin myth]] in the ''[[wikt:Onomasticon|Onomasticon]]''  (a collection of names, similar to a [[thesaurus]]) of  [[Julius Pollux]], a 2nd-century Graeco-Roman sophist. In Pollux's story, [[Hercules]] and his dog were walking on the beach on their way to court a nymph named [[Tyro]]. The dog bit a [[sea snail]], and the snail's blood dyed the dog's mouth [[Tyrian purple]]. Seeing this, the nymph demanded a gown of the same color, and the result was the origin of purple dye.&lt;ref name=silver/&gt;&lt;ref name=snoeck/&gt;&lt;ref name=kress/&gt;  (Some ancient sources attribute the myth to [[Melqart]], a [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyrian]] deity identified with Heracles.)

Rubens' painting of this story depicts Hercules and the dog on the beach, with the dog's mouth stained.&lt;ref name=silver/&gt;&lt;ref name=snoeck&gt;{{citation|title=Rubens|year=2004|publisher=Snoeck|page=170}}. Published on the occasion of Rubens, an exhibition at the Palais des Beaux Arts in Lille, France.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kress&gt;{{citation|title=The Oil Sketches of Peter Paul Rubens: A Critical Catalogue, Volume 1|volume=7|series=Kress Foundation Studies in the History of European Art|first=Julius Samuel|last=Held|publisher=National Gallery of Art|year=1980|page=279}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the snail in the story should be a spiny [[Bolinus brandaris|murex]], the kind of snail from which Tyrian purple was made, Rubens instead depicts a large smooth shell that resembles a [[nautilus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Culture of Animals in Antiquity: A Sourcebook with Commentaries|first1=Sian|last1=Lewis|first2=Lloyd|last2=Llewellyn-Jones|publisher=Routledge|year=2018|isbn=9781351782494|page=868|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GvJFDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT868}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
Rubens' painting was originally part of a cycle of paintings of Hercules, which Rubens painted for the [[Habsburg]] rulers of Spain as sketch for a painting intended to decorate their [[Torre de la Parada]], a hunting lodge. The paintings of the cycle contain allegorical references to the Habsburgs and the wealth they had obtained from the conquest of [[Peru]].&lt;ref name=silver/&gt;

The "royal purple" whose origin story this particular painting depicts was used to clothe emperors, and by the time of Rubens it had become a standard aspect of the depiction of royalty and divinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Routledge Companion to Medieval Iconography|first=Colum|last=Hourihane|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2016|isbn=9781315298368|page=442|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nT4lDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA442}}&lt;/ref&gt; By showing a scene of Hercules' travels to Phoenicia, the painting also refers to a traditional warning, attributed to the Phoenicians, to stay within the bounds of the [[Pillars of Hercules]], and to the [[plus ultra|Habsburgs' own passage beyond that limit]].&lt;ref name=silver&gt;{{citation|title=Rubens, Velázquez, and the King of Spain|first=Larry|last=Silver|publisher=Routledge|year=2017|isbn=9781351550390|pages=106–107|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3TMrDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location and related works==
Rubens' sketch painting is in the [[Musée Bonnat]] in [[Bayonne]]&lt;ref name=silver/&gt; and is one of several works on Herculean subjects there. Others include a drawing of Hercules killing the [[Lernaean Hydra]] by Italian Renaissance painter [[Piero di Cosimo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Hercule tuant l'Hydra de Lerne|url=http://webmuseo.com/ws/musee-bonnat-helleu/app/collection/record/938|publisher=Musée Bonnat|accessdate=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a painting of Hercules killing [[Diomedes of Thrace|Diomedes]] (c.1639–1641) by [[Charles Le Brun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Hercule terrassant Diomède|url=http://webmuseo.com/ws/musee-bonnat-helleu/app/collection/record/245|publisher=Musée Bonnat|accessdate=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Giorgio Vasari]] also painted the same subject, with a similar subtext referring to the wealth of his patron [[Francesco I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany]]; his version is in [[Studiolo of Francesco I]] of the [[Palazzo Vecchio]] in [[Florence]].&lt;ref name=silver/&gt;

An oil painting based on Rubens' sketch by [[Theodoor van Thulden]] is in the [[Prado Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Rubens Hunting Scenes|first=Arnout|last=Balis|publisher=Harvey Miller|year=1986|series=Corpus Rubenianum Ludwig Burchard|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Antique Heriz Serapi Persian Carpet.jpg|thumb|Antique Heriz Serapi carpet]]

'''Heriz rugs''' are  [[Persian rugs]] from the area of [[Heris, East Azerbaijan]] in northwest [[Iran]], northeast of [[Tabriz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.visions.az/en/news/262/35d8792/|title=Visions of Azerbaijan Magazine ::: The Mystique of Azerbaijani Carpets|work=Visions of Azerbaijan Magazine|access-date=2018-09-16|language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such rugs are produced in the village of the same name in the slopes of [[Mount Sabalan]]. Heriz carpets are durable and hard-wearing and they can last for generations. 19th century examples of such carpets are often found on sale by major auction houses in United States and Europe. Part of the reason for the toughness of Heriz carpets is that Mount Sabalan sits on a major deposit of copper. Traces of copper in the drinking water of sheep produces high quality wool that is far more resilient than wool from other areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://artique.uk.com/portfolio-item/persian-heriz-rug/|title=Persian Heriz Rug -artique|work=Artique|access-date=2018-09-16|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heriz rug weavers often make them in geometric, bold patterns with a large medallion dominating the field. Such designs are traditional and often woven from memory.

Similar rugs from the neighbouring towns and villages of the Heriz region are [[Afshar, Meyaneh|Afshar]], [[Mehraban, Iran|Mehraban]], [[Sarab, East Azerbaijan|Sarab]], [[Bakhshayesh|Bakhshaish]], and Gorevan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.firstrugs.com/uncategorized/what-is-the-difference-between-heriz-serapi-gorevan-bakshaish-carpets/|title=What is the difference between Heriz, Serapi, Gorevan, Bakshaish Carpets?|last=|first=|date=2013-12-29|work=First Rugs|access-date=2018-09-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The grades of these rugs are primarily based on village name. Serapis, for example, have been considered the finest grade of Heriz since the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Eiland III, Murray L. Starting to Collect Antique Oriental Rugs: Antique Collectors' Club Ltd., England, 2003. Pages 54-55 {{ISBN|978-0-8212-0643-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heriz rugs are of coarse construction. The rugs range from 30 [[Knots per sq cm|kpsi]] on the low end to 100&amp;ndash;110 kpsi on the high end. It is rare to see a rug over 100 kpsi that would look like an authentic Heriz unless it is an antique silk Heriz.

== History ==
Traditional DTI uses six diffusivity characteristics to model how water molecules diffuse in brain tissues and makes axonal fiber tracking possible.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, DTI had a major limitation in resolving axons from different tracts intersected and crossed en route to their target. In 2009, Learning Research &amp; Development Center (LRDC) at University of Pittsburgh launched the 2009 Pittsburgh Brain Competition&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=PBAIC2009|title=Old 2009 Pittsburgh Brain Connectivity Competition Overview|date=2009-02-05|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Mv8FS3JPmM|accessdate=2018-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; to invite the best research team to work on this problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2015/sept/16-broken-cables|title=Seeing the Brain's Broken Cables {{!}} DiscoverMagazine.com|work=Discover Magazine|access-date=2017-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; A price of $10,000 was offered to the team that could track optic radiations, and teams from 168 countries took part in the competition. A winning team from Taiwan revealed Meyer’s loop, which no other team had successfully tracked. The technique was further developed as HDFT between the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Hornby Railways''' is a British [[model railway]] brand. Its roots date back to 1901, when founder [[Frank Hornby]] received a patent for his [[Meccano]] construction toy. The first clockwork train was produced in 1920.  In 1938, Hornby launched its first [[00 gauge]] train. In 1964, Hornby and Meccano were bought by their competitor, [[Tri-Ang]],&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{Cite book | author=Brown, Kenneth Douglas | authorlink= | coauthors= | title=The British Toy Business: A History since 1700 | date=| publisher=Hambledon &amp; London | location= | isbn=1-85285-136-8 | pages=183–184}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sold on when Tri-ang went into receivership. Hornby Railways became independent in the 1980s, and became listed on the [[London Stock Exchange]], but due to recent{{when|date=December 2017}} financial troubles is presently majority owned by turnaround specialist [[Phoenix Asset Management]].&lt;ref name=BBC40371393/&gt;

==History==

===Early history: 1920–1938 ===
[[File:Hornby early logo.png|thumb|right|A characteristic logotype]]
[[File:JLL Childhood Collection- Model Trains- station 2753c.JPG|thumb|Hornby O gauge tinplate models]]
Hornby was at first a tradename for the railway productions of [[Meccano Ltd]] and based in [[Liverpool]], which released its first train, a [[clockwork]] [[0 gauge]] (1:48) model, in 1920. An electric train soon followed but was under-designed and the few that were made were sold in France. In 1925, a much more successful electric model was introduced, operating on the high voltage of 110 volts [[Alternating current|AC]] power.

Safety concerns saw low voltage 4V and then 6V motors introduced, followed by a reliable 20V AC system, which was developed in the early 1930s. However, clockwork remained the mainstay of the Hornby 0 gauge trains until 1937 and became the only power available in Liverpool-made 0 gauge trains from 1949. Competitors in the UK were [[Leeds Model Company]] and [[Bassett-Lowke]].

A factory was established in [[France]], which developed its own range of French outline trains, but Liverpool dominated export activity elsewhere, with large numbers of Hornby trains exported to [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Argentina]] and Scandinavia. Even though the export models were often painted in 'foreign' liveries, Hornby trains looked very British. Hornby attempted to break into the American market by setting up a factory in 1927 in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]], to make American-style trains.

These were colourful and attractive, but low-market and only clockwork. They probably would have failed in the marketplace because several established U.S. firms could undercut them and Hornby offered no better-class goods or electric models, but the Wall Street Crash precipitated matters. In late 1929, Meccano Ltd. sold its New Jersey factory to the [[A. C. Gilbert Company]] and Hornby trains had vanished from the U.S. market by 1930. The leftover inventory was sold in [[Canada]] and in the UK and some of the tooling was reused for products in other markets.

===Hornby Dublo era: 1938–1963===
[[File:Hornby Dublo logo.gif|thumb|right|Logo, 1956–1961]]
[[File:City of Liverpool locomotive model.jpg|thumb|Hornby Dublo model of an [[LMS Coronation Class|LMS ''Coronation'']] locomotive ''City of Liverpool'' ]]
Meccano introduced its [[OO scale]] trains in 1938 under the name 'Hornby Dublo'. The locomotives were diecast metal, and the carriages and wagons were generally made of tinplate. This was a very well planned range of electric and clockwork models, successfully consolidating 12&amp;nbsp;V DC as the standard for OO scale. This led to the adoption of OO as a broadly accepted modelling standard in the UK, whereas much of the rest of the world adopted HO scale. As for their O gauge locomotives, electric Hornby Dublo locomotives ran on a [[Third rail (model railroading)|third rail]] electric system with the track built on a pressed tinplate base.

Both OO and HO use the same track gauge, but their scales are different. Beginning as literally "half O gauge", the HO models of continental prototypes at 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm/foot scale were workable but Hornby chose to slightly increase the scale to 4&amp;nbsp;mm/foot for the smaller British prototypes, to provide more internal space for a motor. This has had the effect, remaining to this day, of making their gauge an apparent 4&amp;nbsp;ft 1&amp;nbsp;½&amp;nbsp;in rather than the true standard gauge of 4&amp;nbsp;ft 8&amp;nbsp;½&amp;nbsp;in.

The range expanded quickly, but was curtailed from 1940 due to [[World War II]], production being completely suspended in 1942. Production resumed after the war but did not reach full capacity until 1948. Clockwork models were not produced in 00 scale after the war.

In 2008, a special commemorative model of [[LNER Class A4 4498 Sir Nigel Gresley]] was produced, in period packaging, to celebrate the 70th anniversary of this introduction.

Like its counterparts [[Bassett-Lowke]] and [[Edward Exley Limited|Exley]] in the UK and [[Lionel, LLC|Lionel]] and [[American Flyer]] in the US, Hornby thrived in the first half of the 1950s but struggled in the second half of the decade. The company was slow to recognise the threat posed by rival manufacturers (particularly Triang-Rovex)&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt; and to realise the potential of plastic. In 1959, far too late, Hornby introduced two-rail track and moulded plastic rolling stock (the Super Detail series), but even then the system was complicated and difficult to use in comparison to its rivals. With the benefit of hindsight, the policy of keeping the faith with its existing three-rail users whilst bringing the two-rail system to the market was a mistake that cost the company dearly. Whilst all the newer plastic-wheeled rolling stock was compatible with either system, the locomotives (and track) most definitely were not, requiring the two parallel productions of practically every locomotive* in the range to be offered in both formats.  Meanwhile, the company persisted in producing a range of very old-fashioned 0 gauge models, in 1957 completely retooling much of the range instead of taking the opportunity to discontinue it, indicative of major failings at management level.

(* With the exception of the very first two-rail locomotive, a Southern Region R1 0-6-0 tank engine)

===Tri-ang Hornby: 1964–1972===

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Hornby trains.jpg|thumb|A 1960s book of trains.]] --&gt;

In 1964, [[Lines Bros Ltd]]., the parent company of rival [[Tri-ang Railways]], purchased [[Meccano Ltd]]., and merged Hornby and Tri-ang into ''Tri-ang Hornby''.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt; The former Hornby line was discontinued in favour of Tri-ang's less costly plastic designs. The Hornby Dublo tooling was sold to [[G &amp; R Wrenn]], which continued to make most of the loco range and 'superdetail' rolling stock. Remaining stocks of 0 gauge were either scrapped or sold to the local retailer Hattons.

===Hornby Railways: 1972–1980===
[[File:Hornby Railways logo.jpg|thumb|right|Logo, 1978–1996]]
[[File:Hornby 9F 2-10-0 Evening star.jpg|thumb|right|A Hornby model of a [[BR standard class 9F]]]]
The Tri-ang group was disbanded in 1971 when Meccano Ltd's owner Lines Bros. filed for bankruptcy. The former Tri-ang Hornby was sold to Dunbee-Combex-Marx, becoming ''Hornby Railways'' in 1972. By 1976 Hornby was facing challenges from [[Palitoy]] and [[Airfix]], both of which were producing high quality detailed models. Detail on the models was upgraded to make the product line more attractive to adult hobbyists.

=== Zero 1 ===
A 16 channel command control system named ''Zero 1'' was introduced in late 1979. Zero 1 was based on digital, not analog, technology, and as such was a forerunner to the [[NMRA]] [[Digital Command Control]] (DCC) system, which appeared in the 1990s. Advertisements claimed that 16 locomotives could be operated independently at the same time. Though an important milestone, Zero 1 was not widely successful; the controller units and decoder modules required for the locomotives were expensive, but with clean track and well serviced locos the system worked well. Control of points and other accessories was available in a very simple manner. Locomotives equipped with a Zero 1 decoder could not be used on conventional direct current systems, making it difficult to run one's locomotives on friends' layouts or club layouts. This was a common issue with command control systems in that time period. Locomotives with no decoder could not be used on a Zero 1 layout either.

The Master Control unit was discontinued in 1985, the Slave controller, Loco Modules, and accessory modules were still available until the late 1980s. The system is still used today by many modellers, highlighted by the demand on such sites like eBay for the items in the second hand market. Despite being on the market for a short time, Zero 1 had the largest installed base among command control systems in the early 1980s in North America, according to a reader survey done by ''Model Railroader'' magazine.

Zero 1 had 3 'phased' introductions.
:Phase 1 = Master controller and basic system (Master controller, Slave, hand held slave unit and Loco modules)
:Phase 2 = Accessory control (Points, Signals etc.)
:Phase 3 = Micro Mimic display (Allowed for LED'S to represent status of points and signals on a mimic display panel)

The system was mains dependent, so a 50&amp;nbsp;Hz Version and 60&amp;nbsp;Hz version were available (60&amp;nbsp;Hz US only)
Main Master unit discontinued in 1986, and finally the last time Loco Modules were listed was in the 1991 catalogue 'Limited supplies of R955 Loco module are available'. Repairs to Zero 1 units were no longer undertaken by Hornby due to them stating 'Lack of available parts required'.

=== Rocket ===
As part of the 1980 [[Rocket 150]] celebrations, Hornby released a [[live steam]]-powered  3½" gauge locomotive, a model of the ''[[Stephenson's Rocket]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.geocities.com/rolywilliams/hornby_rocket.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027110036/http://uk.geocities.com/rolywilliams/hornby_rocket.html|archive-date=2009-10-27|title=Hornby G100 Stephenson's Rocket|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.familie-bennett.de/rocket/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091231052131/http://www.familie-bennett.de/rocket/|archive-date=2009-12-31|title=Stephen(son)'s Rocket Homepage}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major goal was to make real live steam accessible to an indoor domestic environment. The boiler was considerably smaller than the external diameter, surrounded by a thick insulating jacket to prevent burns. It was fuelled by butane gas, from cigarette lighter refills. To provide more torque from the small cylinders, gearing was adeptly hidden between the cranks and the wheels. The track was of asymmetric moulded plastic units, representing the [[fishbelly rail]]s of the period. These could be assembled either way round, to give either curved or straight track.

By 1980, the market was extremely tough and Dunbee-Combex-Marx was liquidated, placing Hornby in [[receivership]].

===Hornby Hobbies Limited: 1980–2015===
[[Image:Hornby HST 43087-02.jpg|thumb|right|In 2006 a [[Cotswold Rail]] [[British Rail Class 43 (HST)|Class 43]] HST power car carried a livery advertising Hornby. It has since been repainted.]]
In 1980, Hornby became ''Hornby Hobbies'' and in 1981 a management buyout saw the company back on a sound footing. It went public in 1986.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

By the early 1990s Hornby again faced competition from newcomers such as [[Dapol]] and established foreign manufacturers, including [[Lima (models)|Lima]] and [[Bachmann Industries]]. Manufacturing was moved to [[Guangdong]] province in China in 1995, completed by 1999, in a cost-cutting exercise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbbc.org/the_review/review_archive/company_profiles/21.html One The Right Track] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206101026/http://www.cbbc.org/the_review/review_archive/company_profiles/21.html |date=2008-12-06 }}, China-Britain Business Council, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the process Hornby also bought in some of Dapol's products and also some of the old Airfix moulds (by then owned by Dapol). Train sets based on [[Hornby Thomas And Friends|Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends]] and [[Harry Potter]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/2966288.stm|title=Potter keeps Hornby profits on track|publisher=BBC News|date=2005-06-05|accessdate=2008-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the "[[Hogwarts Express]]") have been particularly profitable ventures. In September 2003 Hornby released its first [[steam engine|steam-powered]] 00 gauge locomotive, a model of the record-breaking [[Mallard (locomotive)|''Mallard'']]. Several other "[[Live Steam]]" locomotives have now been produced.

[[File:Hornby 00 scale model of a Stirling GNR Class J13 (LNER Class J52).jpg|thumb|[[GNR Class J13]] model of this period]]
Since then Hornby has bought [[Lima (models)|Lima]], an Italian model railway equipment manufacturer that had previously acquired [[Jouef]], a French manufacturer. Some of the ex-Lima models appear in the main Hornby products list. This range is known as [[Hornby International]]. This acquisition also included the [[Rivarossi]] line of HO-scale products, also originally from Italy, and the Arnold brand of N-scale products. They also took over the Spanish model railway company Electrotren. Electrotren had been the Spanish importer for [[Scalextric]], sold in Spain as Superslot. The takeover was at the request of the Spanish company and was not due to obvious financial problems. They have remained independent outside of the Hornby International umbrella.

With competition mainly from [[Bachmann Industries]], and to a much lesser extent from minor and generally niche players such as the Danish model railway company [[Heljan]], [[Dapol]], [[Vi Trains]] and [[Peco]], Hornby Railways now (in 2008) produce a large range of highly detailed British steam and diesel locomotives, such as the [[BR Standard Class 9F|BR 9F]], [[LNER Class A4]], [[SR Merchant Navy Class|SR Merchant Navy]], [[British Rail Class 60|Class 60]], [[British Rail Class 50|Class 50]], [[British Rail Class 31|Class 31]] and [[British Rail Class 08|Class 08]].

In November 2006, Hornby Hobbies acquired [[Airfix]] and [[Humbrol]] paints for the sum of £2.6 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6134988.stm|title=Hornby snaps up Airfix for £2.6m|publisher=BBC News|date=2006-11-10|accessdate=2008-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The parent company, [[Humbrol]], had gone into administration earlier that year after cashflow problems. Airfix fans had been concerned that it could be the end of the brand, but just as the name Hornby was once a tradename of Meccano, Airfix is now a successful tradename of Hornby.

In May 2008, Hornby announced the acquisition of [[Corgi Classics Limited]], one of the world's oldest makers of collectable die-cast models of trucks, buses, cars and aeroplanes, from [[Corgi International Limited]] for £7.5million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/mergersNews/idUKL0166601520080501|title=Hornby to buy Corgi|publisher=Reuters|date=2008-05-01|accessdate=2008-05-01|first=Mark|last=Potter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7376855.stm|title=Hornby to buy Corgi in £7.5m deal|publisher=BBC News|date=2008-05-01|accessdate=2008-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the Hornby Shop and Visitor Centre was in development. Christmas 2009 saw the launch of the new Hornby Shop at [[Margate]] in [[Kent]], with the visitor centre still in production. July 2010 saw the opening of the Hornby Shop And Visitor Centre.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=November 2014}}

===Financial troubles, PAM takeover===
From 2015, Hornby plc began to announce a series of declining financial results. The major reason behind the decline Hornby declared was two fold, with the decline in the number of (now aged, and hence older) collecting customers, and a lack of interest in modelling as a hobby in light of the digitization and advancement of the internet games industry. After the PLC shares dropped by more than 50% in a year, at the 2016 results Hornby declared that it planned to cut more than half of the toys it made, after discovering that it generated 90% of its profits from only 50% of its range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-39702623|title=Hornby backs chairman in shareholder row|date=2017-04-25|accessdate=2017-11-23|website=Bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the year to 31 March 2017, revenues fell further to £47.4m from £55.8m, while underlying losses widened to £6.3m from a £5.7m deficit in 2016.&lt;ref name=BBC40371393/&gt; The financial declines culminated in July 2017, when the largest shareholder Phoenix Asset Management (PAM) agreed to buy 17.6 million Hornby shares for 32.375p from the second largest - and activist/protagonist shareholder - New Pistoia Income (NPI), which gave PAM a 55.2% holding in the company. This triggered under stock exchange rules a mandatory takeover offer of Hornby by PAM, at the NPI strike price of 32.375p, valuing Hornby at £27.4million.&lt;ref name=BBC40371393&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-40371393|title=Hornby says takeover bid undervalues firm|date=2017-06-22|accessdate=2017-11-23|website=Bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/business/news/phoenix-asset-management-to-launch-mandatory-takeover-offer-for-troubled-hornby-35850169.html|title=Phoenix Asset Management to launch mandatory takeover offer for troubled Hornby|website=Belfasttelegraph.co.uk|accessdate=2017-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the takeover, the chairman of Hornby resigned from the company in August 2017, followed by the Chief Executive in September 2017.&lt;ref name=BBC41223672&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-41223672|title=Toymaker Hornby's boss to step down|date=2017-09-11|accessdate=2017-11-23|website=Bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017 PAM announced their new management team who would join the company and steer through the turnaround. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kentonline.co.uk/kent-business/county-news/hobby-model-expert-lyndon-davies-new-chief-executive-hornby-sandwich-kent-133072/|title='Hobby expert' to lead Hornby|work=Kent Online|access-date=2018-07-02|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They were Lyndon Davies, former Mettoy employee and owner of Oxford Diecast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gaugemaster.com/articles/product-spotlight/oxford-diecast-Interview.html|title=BIG INTERVIEW - Lyndon Davies of Oxford|website=www.gaugemaster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Simon Kohler, ex Hornby marketing manager &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lner.info/forums/viewtopic.php?t=9927|title=Simon Kohler leaves Hornby - The LNER Encyclopedia|website=www.lner.info|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Tim Mulhall, also from Oxford Diecast and credited with knowledge of the International market, having been the former importer for Hornby International brands in the UK &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.herefordtimes.com/news/4168978.Herefordshire_Company_is_a_real_model_of_success/|title=Herefordshire Company is a real model of success|website=Hereford Times|language=en|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The end of year Annual Report for March 2018 revealed how serious the position was for the company, showing further slumps in revenue (down to £35.7m) and a widening pre-tax loss (up to £7.6m).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stockmarketwire.com/article/6017787/Hornby-losses-widen-as-revenue-slumps.html|title=Hornby losses widen as revenue slumps {{!}} 19 June 2018 {{!}} Stock Market Wire|website=www.stockmarketwire.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gauges==
While Lionel thrived in the O Gauge market, American Flyer in the S gauge, and Bachmann in the HO gauge, Hornby thrived in the OO gauge since Lionels' OO gauge demand dropped in the 1940s and 1950s.

==Collector and enthusiasts' groups==
Pre-1964 Hornby trains have enjoyed a level of adult collector interest since the 1940s. In 1969 the '''Hornby Railway Collector's Association''' was founded to cater for this and currently enjoys a membership approaching 3000, producing 10 journals a year, as well as other literature. Publications on older Hornby and Meccano products are dominated by those published by New Cavendish Books as "The Hornby Companion Series", in particular Chris &amp; Julie Graebe's "The Hornby Gauge 0 System" and Michael Foster's sister volume on Hornby Dublo. Triang-Hornby and later Hornby products are catered for by the '''[[Train Collectors Association|Train Collectors' Association]]'''.

==Brands==

===Lima===
{{main|Lima (models)}}

Lima was an Italian company that was a popular, affordable supplier of model railway material but market pressures in the mid-1990s led to Lima merging with [[Rivarossi]], [[Arnold (models)|Arnold]], and [[Jouef]]. When these consolidations failed and operations ceased in 2004, Hornby Railways acquired Lima's assets. As of mid 2006, a range of these products has been made available under the Hornby International brand, refitted with NEM couplings and sprung buffers and sockets for [[Digital Command Control|DCC]] decoders. Lima also had a popular OO gauge range much like Hornby, which strengthened the case for acquisition.

===Jouef===

===Skaledale===
‘Skaledale’ is a range of resin buildings and track accessories produced for 00 gauge railways by Hornby Hobbies Ltd. Production began in 2003 when an initial range of only 6 items were distributed into the market place. The interest and demand proved so positive that the range increased the following year to include new domestic style buildings plus the introduction of station and trackside buildings.

Many of the models are similar to those of 'Lyddle End' (a range which followed 'Skaledale'), but these “N” Gauge buildings are produced to a smaller scale of 1:148.

The Skaledale range comprises station buildings, platforms, trackside accessories, shops, houses, churches, monuments and street furniture.

Forbes Outfitters and St. Andrews Church for example, provided the inspiration for their scaled down models, although others are adapted to suit a particular price point or subject.  The station and trackside buildings are inspired by actual structures but again in some cases adapted to suit manufacturing constraints. Some of the station pieces were inspired by [[Goathland railway station]].

===Lyddle End===
'''Lyddle End''' is the range of [[N scale]] [[Rail transport modelling|model railway]] buildings for Hornby Railways. The buildings are created from high quality die cast [[resin]] and are made to represent the fictional village of Lyddle End, somewhere in England. Most of the buildings are models of [[Great Western Railway|GWR]] style buildings made out of red sandstone.

Hornby created these buildings thanks to the success of their 00 gauge buildings{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}, which they call ''Skaledale''. Many of the buildings are the same as their Skaledale equivalent, except in different scales, to save the cost of designing a new model. They are generally released about 6 months to a year behind their OO counterparts. When Hornby announced their 2010 range, Lyddle End was not mentioned, presumably ended.

==In media==
An attempt to build the world's longest model railway formed the final episode of ''[[James May's Toy Stories]]''.
May, who had previously identified the train set as his "absolute favourite",&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|zZ8IjZ3tUas|James May's Top Toys}}&lt;/ref&gt; hoped that a train would run successfully along the length of the [[Tarka Trail]], which is a disused {{convert|37|mi|km|adj=on}} long railway line in [[North Devon]].&lt;ref name="TarkaProject"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tarka-country.co.uk/tarkaproject/recinfra.html |title=Recreational Infrastructure: Tarka Trail |accessdate=2009-07-31 |publisher=Tarka Country |work=Tarka Project |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515170916/http://www.tarka-country.co.uk/tarkaproject/recinfra.html |archivedate=2008-05-15 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Railway Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/6088019/Vandals-disrupt-Top-Gear-presenter-James-Mays-model-train-record-bid.html |title=Vandals disrupt Top Gear presenter James May's model train record bid |work=The Telegraph |location=London |date=25 Aug 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hornby was heavily involved, providing the track and the prototype of their OO gauge [[British Rail Class 395|British Rail Class 395 ''Javelin'']] train. Simon Kohler, marketing manager of Hornby model railways, said that the train which travels at just {{convert|1|mph|km/h}} failed two miles short of Bideford station; but he also told BBC News "Even though the last locomotive gave up the ghost at Instow, we did link the track.&lt;ref name="Railway Telegraph"/&gt; In April 2011 James tried again, this time against the Germans. All the trains reached their destinations and the British team won.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

== Apprehension and court case ==
After finishing his first feature film, Rajabian was arrested by Iranian security forces on 5 October 2013 outside his office in [[Sari, Iran|Sari]] alongside two musicians, and was transferred to Ward 2-A of [[Evin Prison]] where all three of them were held in solitary confinement for more than two months and were threatened with televised confessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hra-news.org/en/3-artists-sentenced-imprisonment-fine-appeal-court-tehran#more-15094|title=3 Artists Sentenced to Imprisonment and Fine by the Appeal Court of Tehran|website=Hrana – News Agancy|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/24/filmmaker-two-musicians-three-years-prison-iran|title=Film-maker and two musicians face three years prison in Iran|last=Dehghan|first=Saeed Kamali|date=24 March 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was released on bail (around $66,000) in mid-December, pending trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iranhumanrights.org/2016/01/call-on-iranian-authorities-to-drop-charges-on-two-musicians-and-a-filmmaker/|title=Call on Iranian authorities to drop charges on two musicians and a filmmaker|website=International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran|language=en-us|access-date=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, his case was heard at Branch 28 of Tehran [[Islamic Revolutionary Court|Revolutionary Court]] which was presided over by Judge Moghisseh (Summer 2015). He was sentenced to six years in prison and fines for pursuing illegal cinematic activities, launching propaganda against the establishment and hurling insults at sanctities. On appeal, his sentence was changed to three years imprisonment and three years of suspended jail and fines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://artsfreedom.org/?p=10967|title=Iran:  Two musicians and a filmmaker sentenced|website=Artsfreedom|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.iranwire.com/features/6959/|title=Artists Sentenced to Prison|website=en.iranwire.com|access-date=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Imprisonment and hunger strike ==
Hossein Rajabian was sent to the ward 7 of [[Evin Prison]] in [[Tehran]]. After spending one third of his total period of imprisonment (that is 11 months), he went on [[hunger strike]] to protest against unjust trial, lack of medical facilities, and transfer of his brother to another ward called section 8 of the same prison.

The Iran Heritage Foundation (IHF) is a non-political UK registered charity with a mission to promote and preserve the history, languages and cultures of Iran and the Persianate world, covering all periods of Iranian civilization from ancient to modern.

It is funded by contributions from individuals and corporations, and through various fundraising events. The Foundation does not accept financial support from any government organisations or lobbying groups. IHF is governed by a body of trustees supported by an advisory board and grant-giving committees.

=== IHF America ===
In 2010 IHF established an independent parallel organisation in the USA known as IHF America. This organisation supported a curatorial post at the Freer Sackler gallery in Washington DC and played a major role in the British Museum’s tour of the Cyrus Cylinder exhibition to five different US venues in 2013.

== Object / Remit ==

The remit of IHF is wide and includes archaeology, history, art history, literature, the performing arts, film, photography, music and contemporary art. IHF achieves its objectives by organising and supporting exhibitions, cultural events and conferences, giving grants, sponsoring publications, and supporting posts in universities and museums. Cultural/educational institutions that have been supported by IHF include the universities of Cambridge, Edinburgh, Exeter, London, Oxford, Reading, and St Andrews, and the British Library, the British Museum, the Courtauld Institute of Art, Tate Modern, and the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum.

== Activities ==

The Foundation organises a regular series of events including lectures, panel discussions, performances, and film screenings. Major international conferences organised by IHF include: ‘Iran's Natural Heritage’ (2014); ‘From Persepolis to Isfahan: Safeguarding Cultural Heritage’ (2015); and two conferences on Tappeh Sialk and ancient Kashan (2017, 2018). 

IHF also awards annual grants for academic and scholarly research as well as for contemporary and performing arts projects and festivals. These grants are awarded by two separate committees made up of external advisors.

IHF supports and sponsors events and activities which promote Iranian culture and history, including exhibitions such as ‘Forgotten Empire’ and ‘Shah Abbas’ at the British Museum in 2005 and 2009. Additionally, the 2013 exhibition ‘The Cyrus Cylinder and Ancient Persia’, which toured around the US, was organised by the British Museum in partnership with the Iran Heritage Foundation and the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery. An ongoing major project supported by the IHF is the Golha Archive, an online digitized and fully indexed archive of the Golha radio programmes broadcast on Iranian National Radio from 1956 until 1979.

Before 1959, as portraitist, he painted the entire [[Barakzai dynasty|Afghan Royal Family]]. From about 1960 on, he was noted as an abstract painter influenced by the tradition of [[Islamic calligraphy]] and by the American "[[action painting]]" idiom.

==Biography==

Gulgee was born on 26 October 1926 at Karimpura locality in [[Peshawar]], Pakistan. Initially, he went to [[Lawrence College Murree]] and then to [[Aligarh University]] to study civil engineering before heading off to the US for continuing his higher education. Gulgee started to paint while acquiring his training as an engineer in the United States at [[Columbia University]] and then [[Harvard]]. His first exhibition was in 1950.

Gulgee was a gifted and consummately skilled naturalistic [[portrait]] painter who had enjoyed (according to Partha Mitter) "lavish state support" and plenty of elite commissions in this capacity. Nevertheless, he was perhaps best known worldwide for his [[abstract art|abstract]] work, which was inspired by [[Islamic calligraphy]] and was also influenced by the "[[action painting]]" movement of the 1950s and 1960s (Mitter notes that [[Elaine Hamilton-O'Neal|Elaine Hamilton]] was a strong influence in this direction). This is perhaps a natural enough stylistic combination since in both Islamic calligraphy and action painting a high value is placed on the unity and energy of gestural flow. As with the works of other action painters or [[abstract expressionist]]s, Gulgee's canvases were often quite large. He was also known for using materials such as mirror glass and gold or silver leaf in his oil paintings, so that they were in fact [[mixed media]] pieces.

According to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (see external links): "Gulgee's calligraphy paintings are abstract and gestural interpretations of [[Arabic]] and [[Urdu]] letters. His sweeping layers of paint explore the formal qualities of oil paint while they make references to [[Islamic]] design elements." [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/wepk/hd_wepk.htm]

Beginning in the 1960s (if not earlier), Gulgee also created sculptures, including bronze pieces that were (like so many of his paintings) calligraphic in form and inspiration, and sometimes specifically based on verses from the [[Quran]] [source:artnet.com].

His paintings were bright and full of color, but the paint was put on with great sensitivity, and paintings vibrate with intense feeling. Areas sing with luminous, thin color; thick blobs of paint pulsate with fiberglass tears, the brush swirls strong and free. The total effect used to be very free, yet considered and well thought out. They work enormously well, because it was all orchestrated with great care and concentration.

His son [[Amin Gulgee]] is also a famous artist.&lt;ref name="CBC"/&gt;

[Note: the name is also spelled "Guljee", "Gulji", or "Gulgi" in some sources.]

==International and special assignments==

Guljee, as he was famously known, received many requests for his paintings internationally, from the [[Saudi royal family]] to the [[Islamabad presidency]]. Many of his works are placed in the [[Faisal Mosque]] in [[Islamabad]].&lt;ref name="CBC"/&gt; Guljee received many awards, including from Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Japan and France.

==Exhibition and personal life==

Gulgee's exhibitions have mostly been available to few people. Keeping that in mind and high demand from public and lovers of his works, an art gallery for Gulgee has been built in [[Clifton, Karachi]] near [[South City Hospital]] and [[Sea View Karachi]]. Gulgee mostly painted for his own inspirations and vision. Although selected paintings are available for sale in Gulgee art gallery. Gulgee was last based in Boat Basin in Karachi. He has a son [[Amin Gulgee]].

==Murder==

Gulgee, his wife Zarrin Gulgee and a maid were found dead by strangulation&lt;ref name="CBC"/&gt; in their house on the evening of 19 December 2007 by his servants. Police suspect that all three had been murdered.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7151914.stm] While the bodies were found on the 19th, officials report that they had apparently been deceased for three days, leading to a speculative death date of 16 December 2007. Their bodies were found bound and gagged in separate rooms of the house. The initial cause of death for all three has been attributed to suffocation. According to press reports, his son reported that Gulgee's car and driver are missing. Gulgee was buried on the evening of 20 December 2007 in Karachi.

'''Kreft's dichromaticity index''' (DI) is a [[measurement|measure]] for quantification of [[dichromatism]]. It is defined as the difference in [[hue]] angle (Δh&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt;) between the [[color]] of the sample at the dilution, where the [[colorfulness|chroma]] (color saturation) is maximal, and the color of four times more diluted (or thinner) and four times more concentrated (or thicker) sample. The two hue angle differences are called the dichromaticity index towards lighter (Kreft's DI&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) and
dichromaticity index towards darker (Kreft's DI&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;) respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

This means, that pumpkin seed oil changes its color from green-yellow to orange-red (for 44 [[Degree (angle)|degrees]] in [[Lab color space]]) when the thickness of the observed layer is increased from cca 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm to 2&amp;nbsp;mm; and it changes slightly towards green (for 9 degrees) if its thickness is reduced for four-fold.

Straight lines are vectors showing hue (angle) and chroma (length) of the color at maximal chroma (toward the square mark), and the colors of four-fold less or more diluted or thick pumpkin oil (DI&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; and DI&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;). Note that DI&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; is −44.1 degrees and DI&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; corresponds to −8.97 degrees.

== Corporate history ==
[[File:Salon national de la Mode Lenthéric.png|thumb| A lithographic poster promoting ''soins de beauté Lenthéric'' (Paris, before 1900).]]
The  name of the company was taken from Guillaume Lenthéric, a [[French people|French]] distiller and dispenser of perfumes in late 19th century [[France]]. He operated a small salon in 245 [[rue Saint-Honoré]] in [[Paris, France]], beginning in 1875.&lt;ref&gt;“Display Ad 94 — No Title”,
''Wall Street Journal'', 7 December 1954, pg. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;  The firm incorporated in 1924.  Lenthéric became a [[subsidiary]] of [[Bristol-Myers Squibb|Squibb]], and was 90% controlled by the parent company in January 1942.&lt;ref name="gossip" /&gt;

In 1947 Lenthéric, Inc., experienced a decline in earnings due to higher wages, advertising expenses, and vast returns of merchandise from retail stores, which trimmed inventories.&lt;ref&gt;“Abreast of the Market”, ''Wall Street Journal'', 11 October 1947, pg. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951 the company hoped to increase sales by introducing a new line of makeup called ''Sheer Beauty''. It sold for less than $5. The firm also reduced the price of ''Debo'' deodorant from $1.35 to $1.00. This was accomplished by making the product in a plastic squeeze bottle rather than a glass bottle with [[atomizer nozzle|atomizer]].&lt;ref&gt;“Perfume and Powder Purveyors, Introduce Novelties”, ''Wall Street Journal'', 24 August 1951, pg. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Squibb had manufacturing plants in [[Brooklyn, New York]] and [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]] in July 1952. It controlled the Squibb Building at [[Fifth Avenue]] and 58th Street in [[New York City]]. Squibb was acquired by the Olin Mathieson Chemical Corporation in the late summer of 1952.&lt;ref&gt;“Business Milestones”, ''Wall Street Journal'', 11 July 1952, pg. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Helene Curtis Industries, Inc.]], of [[Chicago, Illinois]] acquired the Lentheric, Inc., division of the Olin Mathieson Chemical Corporation in October 1956.&lt;ref name="acquires" /&gt;

In 1990, Old Bond Street, 88.5% owned by [[Wasserstein Perella &amp; Co.]], purchased Lenthéric and [[Yardley of London|Yardley]] from [[SmithKline Beecham]].&lt;ref&gt;“Investor Group acquires SmithKline-Yardley,Lentheric from GlaxoSmithKline PLC through a leveraged buyout”, ''Thomson Financial Mergers &amp; Acquisitions'', 7 July 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1998, Old Bond Street collapsed and Lenthéric was sold to Shaneel Enterprises Ltd.

A '''''Lingua Ignota''''' (Latin for "unknown language") was  described by the 12th century [[abbess]] of Rupertsberg, [[Hildegard of Bingen|St. Hildegard of Bingen, OSB]], who apparently used it for mystical purposes. To write it, she used an alphabet of 23 letters denominated ''litterae ignotae''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bingensis|first1=Hildegardis|title=Riesencodex|date=1175-1190|pages=934, 464v|url=http://dfg-viewer.de/show/?tx_dlf%5Bid%5D=http%3A%2F%2Fdokumentserver.hlb-wiesbaden.de%2FHS_2%2Fmets17.xml&amp;tx_dlf%5Bpage%5D=934&amp;tx_dlf%5Bdouble%5D=0&amp;cHash=16dea2091d5605fe4f100c3fd07fdab5|accessdate=2014-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

She partially described the language in a work titled ''Lingua Ignota per simplicem hominem Hildegardem prolata'', which survived in two manuscripts, both dating to ca. 1200, the [[Wiesbaden Codex]] and a Berlin MS (Lat. Quart. 4º 674), previously Codex Cheltenhamensis 9303, collected by Sir [[Thomas Phillipps]].&lt;ref&gt;Steinmayer E; Sievers, E. (1895). [https://archive.org/stream/diealthochdeutsc03steiuoft#page/390/mode/2up ''Sachlich geordnete Glossare''].  Die Althochdeutschen Glossen, Vol. III. pp. 390-404.&lt;/ref&gt; The text is a [[glossary]] of 1011 words in Lingua Ignota, with [[Gloss (transliteration)|gloss]]es mostly in [[Latin]], sometimes in [[Middle High German|German]]; the words appear to be [[A priori (Languages)|a priori]] [[Neologism|coinages]], mostly nouns with a few adjectives. Grammatically it appears to be a partial [[relexification]] of Latin, that is, a language formed by substituting new vocabulary into an existing grammar.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Jean Jeskalian, ''Hildegard of Bingen: the creative dimensions of a Medieval personality."  Graduate Theological Union&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of Lingua Ignota is unknown, and it is not known who, besides its creator, was familiar with it. In the 19th century some{{who?|date=July 2018}} believed that Hildegard intended her language to be an ideal, [[universal language]]. However, nowadays{{when?|reason= starting when?|date=July 2018}} it is generally{{whom?|reason=If you don't mean that in the implausible sense of "by everyone", then by whom?|date=July 2018}} assumed that Lingua Ignota was devised as a secret language; like Hildegard's "unheard music", she would have attributed it to [[divine inspiration]]. Inasmuch as {{vague|reason= is this supposed mean "To the degree that" or "Since (as all readers will agree)"?|date=July 2018}}  the language was constructed by Hildegard, it may be considered one of the earliest known [[constructed language]]s.

In a letter to Hildegard, her friend and provost Wolmarus, fearing that Hildegard would soon die, asks ''[[ubi sunt|ubi]] tunc vox inauditae melodiae? et vox inauditae linguae?'' (Descemet, p.&amp;nbsp;346; "where, then, the voice of the unheard melody? And the voice of the unheard language?"), suggesting that the existence of Hildegard's language was known, but there were no initiates who would have preserved its knowledge after her death.

==Sample text==
The only extant text in the language is the following short passage:
:''O '''orzchis''' Ecclesia, armis divinis praecincta, et hyacinto ornata, tu es '''caldemia''' stigmatum '''loifolum''' et urbs scienciarum. O, o tu es etiam '''crizanta''' in alto sono, et es '''chorzta''' gemma.''
These two sentences are written mostly in Latin with five key words in Lingua Ignota; as only one of these is unambiguously found in the glossary (''loifol'' "people"), it is clear that the vocabulary was larger than 1011 words.  (Higley 2007 finds probable correspondences for two other words.)

:"O ''orzchis'' [[Ecclesia (Church)|Ecclesia]], girded with divine arms, and adorned with hyacinth, you are the ''caldemia'' of the wounds of the ''loifol'', and the city of sciences. O, o, and you are the ''crizanta'' in high sound, and you are the ''chorzta'' gem."
''loifol'' "people" apparently is inflected in Latin, yielding ''loifol-um''.

Newman (1987) conjectures the translation
:"O ''measureless'' Church, / girded with divine arms / and adorned with jacinth, / you are the ''fragrance'' of the wounds of ''nations'' / and the city of sciences. / O, o, and you are ''anointed'' / amid noble sound, / and you are a ''sparkling'' gem."

==The glossary==
The glossary is in a hierarchical order, first giving terms for God and angels, followed by terms for human beings and terms for family relationships, followed by terms for body-parts, illnesses, religious and worldly ranks, craftsmen, days, months, clothing, household implements, plants, and a few birds and insects. Terms for mammals are lacking (except for the [[bat]], Ualueria, listed among birds, and the [[Griffin|gryphon]], Argumzio, a half-mammal, also listed among the birds).

The first 30 entries are (after Roth 1880):
* Aigonz: ''deus'' (God)
* Aieganz: ''angelus'' (angel)
* Zuuenz: ''sanctus'' (saint)
* Liuionz: ''salvator'' (saviour)
* Diueliz: ''diabolus'' (devil)
* Ispariz: ''spiritus''
* Inimois: ''homo'' (human being)
* Jur: ''vir'' (man)
* Vanix: ''femina'' (woman)
* Peuearrez: ''patriarcha''
* Korzinthio: ''propheta''
* Falschin: ''[[vates]]''
* Sonziz: ''apostolus''
* Linschiol: ''martir''
* Zanziuer: ''confessor''
* Vrizoil: ''virgo'' (virgin)
* Jugiza: ''vidua'' (widow)
* Pangizo: ''penitens''
* Kulzphazur: ''attavus'' (great-great-great-grandfather)
* Phazur: ''avus'' (grandfather)
* Peueriz: ''pater'' (father)
* Maiz: ''maler'' (sic, for ''mater'', mother)
* Hilzpeueriz: ''nutricus'' (stepfather)
* Hilzmaiz: ''noverca'' (stepmother)
* Scirizin: ''filius (son)
* Hilzscifriz: ''privignus'' (stepson)
* Limzkil: ''infans'' (infant)
* Zains: ''puer'' (boy)
* Zunzial: ''iuvenis'' (youth)
* Bischiniz: ''adolescens'' (adolescent)

Nominal composition may be observed in ''peueriz'' "father" : ''hilz-peueriz'' "stepfather", ''maiz'' "mother" : ''hilz-maiz'' "stepmother", and ''scirizin'' "son" : ''hilz-scifriz'' "stepson", as well as ''phazur'' : ''kulz-phazur''. Suffixal derivation in ''peueriz'' "father", ''peuearrez'' "patriarch".

'''Little Superstar''' is a video uploaded on [[YouTube]], which is a clip from the 1990 Indian film ''[[Adhisaya Piravi]]'', starring [[Rajinikanth]]. The clip features the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] actor [[King Kong (actor)|King Kong]] (not to be confused with Thavakalai, and  another Indian little person actor, E. Shankar also known as King Kong) [[breakdance|breakdancing]] to [[MC Miker G &amp; DJ Sven]]'s "[[Holiday Rap]]". Various [[mashup (video)|mashup]]s have also appeared on the Internet using tracks from [[Cypress Hill]], [[Michael Jackson]] and others, including Ted's Fear Factory video. The first site to feature Little Superstar and give the clip its name was Dorks.com.

The video has been featured on [[YouTube]], in [[Tom Anderson (MySpace)|Tom Anderson's]] bulletins on [[Myspace]], on the [[E!]] TV show [[The Soup]], the [[MSNBC]] shows Countdown with [[Keith Olbermann]] and  [[Tucker Carlson]], G4TV's [[Attack of the Show!]] and elsewhere, as well as having been parodied on [[Saturday Night Live]]. Another popular video clip features King Kong (not E. Shankar),(actor) King Kong slapping a man from the same movie.

In recent years, actor [[King Kong (actor)|King Kong]] E. Shankar has choreographed a dance number in a ''[[Doritos]] Tandoori Sizzler!'' commercial shown in [[Canada]], which was filmed in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7py1aRJH3eE YouTube - tandoori sizzler dancer&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transcript of the video==

===Dancing clip===
''Mother:'' Hey, hey. What's with the party early morning? Get out everybody, shoo, shoo. [''Speaking to [[Rajinikanth]], who's lying on the cot''] Why not take some rest, dear?

''Rajinikanth:'' OK Mom [''lights up a [[beedi]] as she walks away''].

''[[King Kong (actor)|King Kong]]:'' Dude, give me a [[beedi]].

''Rajinikanth:'' Hey! Kids shouldn't smoke.

''King Kong:'' Buddy, I'm ten years older than you. Give it to me I say.

''Rajinikanth:'' And if I don't?

''King Kong:'' I'll skin you alive.

''Rajinikanth:'' Here you go. 

===Slapping clip===
''King Kong:'' Brother, you don't worry about this silly duel. I'll take care of this myself (with my hands).

''Rajinikanth:'' Ok.

(King Kong slaps thug)

''King Kong:'' [''pauses and looks at Rajinikanth''] Dude, how (am I doing)?

''Rajinikanth:'' Great!

''Rajinikanth:'' Enough. He's going to die!

[''King Kong returns to cot'']

''Rajinikanth:'' Well, is this enough or do you want a piece of me too?

==Misconceptions==
The clips were incorrectly reported as being from [[Bollywood]], which predominantly refers to the filmmaking industry of [[Hindi language|Hindi]] films, in some places on the web and TV media, such as YouTube, Yahoo and the "Oddball Plays of the Month" segment of Keith Olbermann show on MSNBC. The film is actually from [[Tamil cinema]], colloquially known as ''Kollywood'', the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] filmmaking industry based in [[Chennai]], [[Tamil Nadu]], India.

[[King Kong (actor)|King Kong]] has been incorrectly described as a [[child actor]] in some places. He is actually an adult with [[dwarfism]]. He was also never known as a "little superstar" in the Tamil film industry and is only the title of the clip given by its uploaders.

==In popular culture==
A parody version of "Little Superstar" starring porn star [[Ron Jeremy]] first started turning up on [[video sharing]] websites in March 2007. Another parody starring [[Fred Armisen]] as King Kong and [[Bill Hader]] as Rajinikanth aired on [[Saturday Night Live]] on April 21, 2007. [[Nobody's Watching]] also created a parody of the video. A parody of "Little Superstar" appeared in the season finale [[Gorillas in the Mist (American Dad!)]] of the sixth season of ''[[American Dad!]]''. It was also cited by [[Bobby Moynihan]] as a source of inspiration for SNL's "Haunted Elevator" sketch, which aired in late 2016 and featured noted character [[David S. Pumpkins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fox|first1=Jesse David|title=An Oral History of ‘David Pumpkins’|url=http://www.vulture.com/2017/10/david-s-pumpkins-oral-history.html|website=Vulture|accessdate=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Loyalties''''' is a 1999 Canadian documentary film directed by [[Lesley Ann Patten]] about two women—one white, one black—who discover that they are related due to the  legacy of [[slavery in the United States]]. In 1995, Dr. Ruth Whitehead of the [[Nova Scotia Museum of Natural History]] in [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]] met [[Black Canadian]] graduate student Carmelita Robertson, who happened to mention that her relatives came to [[Nova Scotia]] from [[South Carolina]] as [[Black Loyalists]] in the late 18th century. Whitehead, whose own family also came from South Carolina, realized that she recognized some of the names of Robertson's ancestors, and together the two women journey to [[Charleston, South Carolina]] to explore their shared past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Movies &amp; video|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aJhIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XAoNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3694%2C724763|accessdate=15 July 2012|newspaper=[[The Post and Courier]]|location=Charleston|date=18 March 1999|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The film also exposes strains in the personal relationship between the two women, with Whitehead descended from wealthy slave owners, and Robertson the descendant of their slaves.&lt;ref name=North&gt;{{cite book|title=North of Everything: English-Canadian Cinema Since 1980|publisher=University of Alberta Press|isbn=978-0888643902|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iLNhHWfarosC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;dq=Loyalties+NFB+Leslie+patten&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=m4CdGyIn4-&amp;sig=mEWs8Bw07vDYAzoyvC1ngFqHgTQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TpL_T5qZBKrk0QG_o8TqBw&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Loyalties%20NFB%20Leslie%20patten&amp;f=false|editor=William Beard and Gerry White|page=37|chapter=Brave New Film Board|date=1 June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Butcher&gt;{{cite journal|last=Butcher|first=Kristen|title=Loyalties|journal=Canadian Materials|date=8 September 2000|volume=VII|issue=1|url=http://www.umanitoba.ca/cm/vol7/no1/loyalties.html|accessdate=13 July 2012|publisher=Manitoba Library Association|ISSN=1201-9364| format=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Manoel Theatre''' ({{lang-mt|It-Teatru Manoel}}; {{lang-it|Teatro Manoel}}) is a [[theatre]] and important performing arts venue in [[Malta]]. The theatre is often referred to as simply '''"The Manoel"''', and is named after [[List of Grand Masters of the Knights Hospitaller|Grand Master]] of [[Knights Hospitaller|the Order of the Knights Hospitaller]], [[António Manoel de Vilhena|Fra António Manoel de Vilhena]], who ordered its construction in 1731. The theatre is reputed to be Europe's third-oldest working theatre (older than the San Carlo in Naples), and the oldest theatre still in operation in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].&lt;ref name=VLH&gt;{{cite web|title=Manoel Theatre|url=http://www.maltaattraction.com/content.aspx?id=199484|publisher=Valletta - Living history|accessdate=1 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217231601/http://www.maltaattraction.com/content.aspx?id=199484|archivedate=17 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre is located on Old Theatre Street ([[Maltese language|Maltese]]: ''Triq it-Teatru l-Antik'') in [[Valletta]]. It considers itself as the country's national theatre and the home of [[Malta Philharmonic Orchestra]] ([[Maltese language|Maltese]]: ''Orkestra Filarmonika Nazzjonali'').&lt;ref name=VLH/&gt; Originally called the ''Teatro Pubblico,'' its name was changed to ''Teatro Reale,'' or Theatre Royal, in 1812, and renamed ''Manoel Theatre'' in 1866. The first play to be performed was [[Francesco Scipione, marchese di Maffei|Maffei]]'s [[Merope (Messenia)#Maffei.27s Merope|Merope]]. 

The theatre is a small, 623 seat venue, with an oval-shaped [[auditorium]], three tiers of boxes constructed entirely of wood, decorated with gold leaf, and a pale blue [[trompe-l'oeil]] ceiling that resembles a round cupola. The building is a Grade 1 [[listed building]] as noted by Malta's Superintendence of Cultural Heritage, and is also scheduled by the [[Malta Environment and Planning Authority]] (MEPA).&lt;ref name=Sup&gt;{{cite web|title=National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands|url=http://www.culturalheritage.gov.mt/filebank/inventory/01140.pdf|publisher=Superintendence of Cultural Heritage|accessdate=28 February 2014|date=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Triq it-Teatru l-Antik Valletta.jpg|right|thumb|Old Theatre Street, named after the Manoel Theatre.|329x329px]]

Before the construction of the theatre, plays and amateur theatrical productions were staged in the halls and ''[[piano nobile]]s'' of the Knights' auberges. These were palaces constructed for the ''[[Langue (Knights Hospitaller)|langues]]'' of the Order. The Langue of Italy often held such entertainment, staged by its knights in their Auberge. The records of the Langue even state that on February 2, 1697, some Maltese gentlemen presented a play in the ''[[Auberge d'Italie]].'' Women were prohibited from attending these events after incidents during the Carnival festivities of 1639.

In 1731, [[António Manoel de Vilhena]] commissioned and personally funded the construction of the building to serve as a public theatre "''for the honest recreation of the people.''"{{refn|group=n|This phrase was inscribed above the main entrance to the theatre,&lt;ref name=FacR&gt;{{cite news|title=Manoel Theatre façade to be restored|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2013-09-26/news/manoel-theatre-facade-to-be-restored-2727215104/|accessdate=1 March 2014|newspaper=The Malta Independent|date=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which still reads to this today: "''Ad honestam populi oblectationem.''"{{la icon}} }} The Grand Master bought two houses from the Priory of [[Navarre]], with a frontage on what is now Old Theatre Street for the sum of 2,186 ''scudi''.{{refn|group=n|Vilhena also paid a further 2,000 ''scudi'' for the reconstruction of the Navarrese knights' two remaining houses, which then became known as the New Priory of Navarre.&lt;ref name=RMK&gt;Repertorio Fondazione Manoel, R.M.K. Treas. A. 25 fo. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;}} It has a plain [[façade]], in keeping with Valletta's [[Mannerism (architecture)|Mannerist]] style, and has three floors with a [[mezzanine]]-level above the ground floor. The façade incorporates a doorway surmounted by a stone balustraded open balcony, itself supported by three heavy scroll corbels.&lt;ref name=Sup/&gt; The interior is decorated in [[Rococo]] style. The theatre was possibly designed by [[Romano Carapecchia]], and was built by [[Francesco Zerafa]] and Antonio Azzopardi.&lt;ref name=Sup/&gt;

Construction was finished in only ten months. This however, may be because alterations were made to the fabric of the three adjoining houses, incorporating them into a theatre. The building occupied an area of 94½ [[Maltese units of measurement|square canes]],{{refn|group=n|{{convert|496.31|sqyd|m2|lk=in|sigfig=3}}}} which was later altered to 93 square canes and 2½ palms.{{refn|group=n|{{convert|488.64|sqyd|m2|lk=in|sigfig=3}}}}&lt;ref name=Denaro/&gt; The theatre is said to have been modelled after the contemporary [[Palermo]] Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Scicluna, Sir Hannibal P., "Buildings and Fortifications of Valletta", in ''Malta and Gibraltar''; London, W.H. &amp; L. Collingridge, at p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; Its auditorium was originally semi-circular or horseshoe shaped, with an illuminated parterre that served as a small dance floor. The first theatrical performance to be staged at the ''Teatro Pubblico'' was Scipione Maffei's classic tragedy ''Merope'', on January 9, 1732.&lt;ref&gt;''Compendio del Giornale del Sac. Fra. Gaetano Rebout. R.M.L.'', Ms. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The actors in that production were the Knights themselves, and the set was designed by the Knights' chief military architect, Francois Mondion.&lt;ref name=Wix/&gt;

On January 26, 1732 a satirical and anti-clerical play "''Il bacchettiere falso''" by Girolamo Gigli was performed. On January 18, 1769, the play "Il trionfo di Minerva", by Lentisco Adrasteo was presented on the occasion of [[Manuel Pinto da Fonseca|Grand Master Manuel Pinto da Fonseca]]'s birthday.&lt;ref name=Wix/&gt; A similar honour was also given to [[Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim]], on his elevation as Grand Master. On this occasion, Hompesch appeared on the balcony thanking the crowd, showering handfuls of gold coins on the people that had gathered to applaud.&lt;ref name=Wix&gt;{{cite web|title=The Opera Page|url=http://czh227.wix.com/the-opera-page#!page-2|publisher=Wix.com|accessdate=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of the next half-century, it was the venue for an extensive repertoire of lyric operas performed by companies of visiting professionals or by amateur groups of knights, and French tragedies or Italian comedies. Works by [[Johann Adolf Hasse]], [[Niccolò Piccinni]] and Baldassare [[Galuppi]] were extremely popular at the theatre during its early years.

In its early days, the management of the theatre, and censorship of its performances, was entrusted to a senior knight, known as the ''Protettore.''&lt;ref name=BEG&gt;{{cite web|title=The Beginning|url=http://www.teatrumanoel.com.mt/?m=content&amp;id=135|publisher=Teatru Manoel|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first recorded [[impresario]] was Melchiorre Prevvost Lanarelli in 1736, and the last Giovanni Le Brun in 1866. From 1768 to 1770 the impresario was a woman, Natala Farrugia.&lt;ref name=BEG /&gt; In setting up the theatre, Grand Master de Vilhena set the rent to be paid by the impresario at 320 ''scudi'' per annum, of which 80 accrued for rent from [[Easter]] to August, 120 for autumn, and another 120 ''scudi'' from [[Christmas Island|Christmas]] to [[Carnival]]. When dances or ''veglioni'' ([[masked ball]]) were held in the theatre, the pit was raised by a scaffolding to the level of the stage. On August 22, 1778, regulations were passed for the lighting of the theatre and corridors on such occasions, with the shading of lights, in any manner, being prohibited.&lt;ref name=Denaro&gt;{{cite journal |last=Denaro |first=Victor |year=1960 |title=The Manoel Theatre |journal=Melita Historica |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=1–4 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1778, to avoid scandal, theatre companies were prohibited from sleeping in the boxes of the theatre. This was a practice which was common during that time.&lt;ref name=Denaro/&gt; A few years later, in 1783, the ''Teatro Pubblico'' underwent considerable modification and decoration, based on a design by the Roman architect, Natale Marini.&lt;ref name="Sup" /&gt; A model was displayed before the [[Inquisition|inquisitor]] and many knights, and the model was so admired that the Commissioners of the Foundation of the Theatre decided to add a further two ''louis,'' as a bonus to Marini’s invoice of 49 ''scudi.''&lt;ref&gt;''Diverse Scritture relative alla Fondazione Manoel'', R.M.L., Treas. A. 32, cited by {{harvp|Denaro|1960|p=2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nicolas Isouard]]'s first known opera, ''Casaciello perseguitato da un mago,'' was performed here in 1792, and Isouard became director of this theatre in 1798, after the [[French occupation of Malta|French captured Malta]], and continued to premiere other operas there.&lt;ref name=FacR/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Xuereb, The Manoel Theatre, a short history, Valletta, Friends of the Manoel Theatre&lt;/ref&gt; Several of Isouard's own works, including ''Avviso ai Maritati'' and ''Artaserse'', were performed at the Manoel during this time. French rule over Malta was short-lived and within two years the islands passed into the hands of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]]. An English gentleman who accompanied [[Battle of Alexandria|Abercrombie’s expedition to Egypt]] in 1801, wrote that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"La Valette possesses an opera, small indeed, but neat, though much out of repair. Italy and Sicily supply it with very tolerable vocal performers, and it is a very agreeable entertainment for the garrison. It was excessively crowded every night by the officers of the expedition, to whom it was a great source of amusement. The price of admission is one shilling."&lt;ref name=Egy&gt;{{cite book|last=Walsh|first=Thomas|title=Journal of the Late Campaign in Egypt: Including Descriptions of that Country, and of Gibraltar, Minorca, Malta, Marmorice, and Macri; with an Appendix; Containing Official Papers and Documents|year=1803|publisher=T.

[[File:Manoel theatre (12851453033).jpg|thumbnail|The proscenium and theatre-boxes at the Manoel.]]

During the early [[Crown Colony of Malta|British Era]], the "''Teatro Pubblico''" was renamed as the ''"Teatro Reale"'', going through a series of enlargements and re-modellings throughout the 19th century, most notably in 1812, when [[George Whitmore (British Army officer)|Sir George Whitmore]] added today's gallery and [[proscenium]], raised the ceiling by one storey, and added eight more boxes, bringing the total to 67. Whitmore also transformed the auditorium to the oval shape that it has today.&lt;ref name=Denaro/&gt; Further alterations were made in 1844, when the Manoel’s set designer, Ercolani, repainted the panels on the wooden boxes and had them gilded. Another stratum of silver leaf was added to the panels and ceiling in 1906. Throughout this time, the Teatro Reale was rented out to professional impresarios, who hosted nine-month opera seasons.&lt;ref name=Denaro/&gt; It was visited by many foreign dignitaries, including [[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott]], and [[Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen|H.M. Queen Adelaide, the Queen Dowager]], widow of William IV of England, who attended performances of ''Elisir d'Amore'' and ''[[Gemma di Vergy]]'' at the theatre, during her convalescence in Malta.&lt;ref name=Denaro/&gt; ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'' was given as a gala night in honour of the Queen Dowager, featuring [[soprano]] Camilla Darbois.&lt;ref&gt;Rolandi, Ulderico, "Musica e Musicisti in Malta", in ''Archivio Storico di Malta'', Vol. I, Fasc. I, page 20, cited by {{harvp|Denaro|1960|p=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; English and Italian opera and operetta were the most popular productions at the ''Teatro Reale'' throughout the 19th century; however, the Maltese public was particularly supportive of operas by [[Rossini]], [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]], [[Donizetti]] and [[Verdi]].

[[Image:Royal Opera House (1866) elevation.jpg|thumb|Elevation view of the [[Royal Opera House, Valletta|Royal Opera House]], Valletta, c. 1866.|left]]

In 1861, the Teatro Reale was given on perpetual lease, by the government, to Dr. Salvatore Mifsud and Anacleto Conti for an annual ground rent of £236,15, and in 1862, the directum dominium was sold to Emmanuele Scicluna for £7,833.6.8.&lt;ref name=FacR/&gt;&lt;ref name=Denaro/&gt; Subsequent owners were Carmelo Arpa, a chemist (1889) and the Gollcher family (1906-7).&lt;ref&gt;Records of Notary Luigi Vella of 5 May 1861, and of 9 September 1802, cited by {{harvp|Denaro|1960|p=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre had fallen into disuse in 1866, as a result of the construction of Malta's new [[Royal Opera House, Valletta|Royal Opera House]], designed by [[Edward Middleton Barry]], on Strada Reale, at the entrance to Valletta. The theatre began to serve as a doss house for homeless and indigent citizens,&lt;ref name=FacR/&gt; who rented out the stalls for a few pennies a night.&lt;ref name=Denaro/&gt; However, in 1873, the ''Teatro Reale'' - was officially renamed the "''Manoel Theatre''",&lt;ref name=FacR/&gt; and it enjoyed a brief new lease on life when the Royal Opera House burnt down. But by 1877, the Royal Opera House had been rebuilt, and once more, the Manoel Theatre was eclipsed and fell again into disuse. On December 27, 1922, January 6, 1923 and February 3, 1923, the Manoel Theatre was the venue for the first public airing of Malta's National Anthem, "''[[L-Innu Malti]].''"&lt;ref name=Denaro/&gt; During the [[Second World War at Sea series|Second World War]], the Manoel Theatre served as emergency accommodation for victims of the constant bombardment by the [[Luftwaffe]] and the [[Regia Aeronautica]].&lt;ref name=FacR/&gt; In the early 20th century, it was also used intermittently as the venue for Carnival balls and, for a period of about twenty years, it operated as a [[movie theatre]].

The theatre was included on the Antiquities List of 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Protection of Antiquities Regulations 21st November, 1932 Government Notice 402 of 1932, as Amended by Government Notices 127 of 1935 and 338 of 1939. |url=https://www.mepa.org.mt/file.aspx?f=2627 |website=[[Malta Environment and Planning Authority]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6guMwmZDW?url=https://www.mepa.org.mt/file.aspx?f=2627 |archivedate=20 April 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite numerous alterations over the years, it retains many of its old architectural features, such as the white [[Carrara marble]] staircase, shell-shaped niches, and [[Vienna|Viennese]] chandeliers. Two water reservoirs beneath the floor create an acoustic environment that is so precise, that the hushed page-turnings of an [[orchestra conductor]] can be heard clearly throughout the auditorium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Anthem Guide to the Opera, Concert Halls and Classical Music Venues of Europe|year=2009|publisher=Anthem Press|isbn=0857286838|page=323|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mfxgGNCV62IC|editor=Steven Isserlis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the destruction of the [[Royal Opera House, Valletta|Royal Opera House]] by [[World War II|Axis bombardment]] on April 7, 1942, the Manoel Theatre was expropriated by the [[Government of Malta]] in 1956, and was quickly restored to its former glory. It reopened in December 1960 with a performance of [[Coppélia]] by [[Ballet Rambert]].&lt;ref name=20th&gt;{{cite web|title=The 20th Century|url=http://www.teatrumanoel.com.mt/?m=content&amp;id=139|publisher=Teatru Manoel|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent years the theatre [[foyer]] was enlarged by means of the annexation of the adjacent Palazzo Bonici, a grand 18th century palace that was the former home of the Testaferrata Bonnici family, however on January 9, 2007, the Constitutional Court of Malta revoked the 1958 order of possession and use in respect of this property, and ordered that the property be returned to its original owner.&lt;ref name=TOM1&gt;{{cite news|last=Cooke|first=Patrick|title=Government breached noble’s property rights|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20130904/local/Government-breached-noble-s-property-rights.484738|accessdate=1 March 2014|newspaper=Times of Malta|date=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This annex currently houses the theatre's bar and restaurant.&lt;ref name=TOM1/&gt;

In 2004, Saint-Pierre founded MJSTP Films, her animation and documentary production company. There is a chapter devoted to her work in the 2010 book ''Animated Realism: A Behind The Scenes Look at the Animated Documentary Genre'', published by [[Focal Press]].&lt;ref name=elle/&gt;

In 2009, she was selected as the international artist in residency for the S-AIR Inter-cross Creative Center in Sapporo, Japan.&lt;ref name=movie/&gt; In January 2013, her work was featured in a retrospective at the [[Cinémathèque québécoise]], where she also taught master classes.&lt;ref name="cq"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cinematheque.qc.ca/en/programmation/projections/retrospective-marie-josee-saint-pierre/ | title=Projections | publisher=[[Cinémathèque québécoise]] | accessdate=29 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the [[National Film Board of Canada]] released ''Jutra'', her animated documentary portrait on Quebec filmmaker [[Claude Jutra]] that was selected for the Director's Fortnight at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].  The film won the Canadian Screen Award for best short documentary as well as the Jutra Award for best short animated film.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15128">'''Marius Sznajderman''' (born July 18, 1926 in [[Paris]], France) was a painter, printmaker and scenic designer living and working in the United States. He passed away on 24 February 2018, in Amherst, Massachusetts.

Born in Paris, he escaped to Spain and then Venezuela in 1942 with his parents. He attended the School of Fine Arts in Caracas and immigrated to the United States in 1949, where he received a Bachelor of Fine Arts and Master of Fine Arts from Columbia University in New York.&lt;ref name=YivoInstitute&gt;{{cite web|title=Yivo Institute for Jewish Research|url=http://yivoarchives.org/?p=collections/controlcard&amp;id=34316|website=yivoarchives.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; He settled in Hackensack, New Jersey, where he lived and had a studio for more than 50 years before moving to Amherst, Massachusetts in 2015. His work, which includes painting, prints and collages, as well as set designs, is in more than 45 museum and public institution collections in the United States, Latin America and Israel. He held more than 40 solo exhibitions at galleries and museums and participated in more than 75 group shows around the globe.

== Biography ==

Born in Paris in 1926, his Jewish parents had migrated to France from Poland in 1923. In November 1942 the family fled Nazi-occupied France for Spain before settling in Caracas, Venezuela. Sznajderman briefly studied medicine at the Universidad Central de Venezuela in Caracas but did not complete a medical degree. More interested in art than medicine, he attended the School of Fine Arts in Caracas where he studied painting, printmaking and scenic design. His teachers included illustrator Ramon Martin Durban, scenic designer Charles Ventrillon-Horber and painter Rafael Monasterios.

He helped found the Taller Libre de Arte, an experimental workshop for the visual arts, sponsored by the Ministry of Education. The Taller Libre de Arte was a center for young artists to work and to meet with critics and intellectuals to discuss avant-garde ideas and artistic trends from Europe and Latin America. Among the notable artists who participated in the Taller Libre de Arte were Ramón Vásquez Brito, Carlos González Bogen, Luis Guevara Moreno, [[Mateo Manaure]], Virgilio Trómpiz, Alirio Oramas, Dora Hersen, [[Alejandro Otero]], [[Jesús Rafael Soto]], Pascual Navarro, Aimée Battistini, José Fernández Díaz, Narciso Debourg, [[Oswaldo Vigas]] and Perán Erminy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Masterpiece Online|url=http://www.masterpieceonline.com/bio.php?artistId=7401&amp;id=18B9-DGFH-6E59&amp;name=Marius%20Sznajderman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sznajderman’s early works as a student and young artist showed the influence of Cubism and Expressionism with subject matter ranging from figures to still life to Venezuelan landscapes. His work often explored Latin American themes, art and architecture.

In 1948 Sznajderman was awarded the art student’s prize for a watercolor in the annual National Gallery exhibit. 
In 1949 Sznajderman had a solo exhibition at the Taller Libre de Arte. The exhibit catalogue was written by Sergio Antillano, a prominent Venezuelan writer and critic.
 
That same year, Sznajderman immigrated to the United States to attend Columbia University, where he studied with scenic designer J. Woodman Thompson and printmaker Hans Alexander Mueller. He received a Bachelor of Science degree with a major in scenic design in 1953, after which he was drafted into the U.S. Army. In the military he worked as an artist-illustrator, completing his service in 1955. He returned to Columbia on the G.I Bill to attend Teachers College, where he received a Master of Fine Arts in art education.

During the 1950s Sznajderman created set designs for [[Circle in the Square Theatre]], the French Art Theatre and the Felix Fibish Dance Company, all in New York. By the late 1950s, however, his focus was shifting to fine arts and teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New York Public Library, Archives &amp; Manuscripts|url=http://archives.nypl.org/the/22122}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
In 1956 he married journalist Suzanne Messing. They settled in Hackensack, New Jersey, where the couple reared three children.

In 1960 Sznajderman was among the three founders, along with painters Sam Weinik and Ben Wilson, of the Modern Artists Guild (MAG), an association of modern artists working in northern New Jersey. MAG remained active in the New York metropolitan area into the mid-1980s, with members exhibiting individually and as a group. Among the artists who were early members of MAG were Esther Rosen, Alexandra Merker, Erna Weill, Jerry Goldman, Lillian Marzell and Evelyn Wilson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Teaneck Public Library, Oral History of Teaneck (2)|url=http://wwww.teaneck.org/virtualvillage/OralHistory2/rosen.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, in addition to painting and printmaking, Sznajderman taught art, art history and design at a number of institutions including [[New York University]], the [[School of Visual Arts]], [[Fairleigh Dickinson University]] and the Ridgewood (N.J.) School of Art. He also taught art in New Jersey public schools under federal and state grants. During this period, Sznajderman’s work ranged from drawings, woodcuts and lithographs to watercolor and acrylic paintings and collages. He produced still life, figures, landscapes and seascapes. Inspirations included Venezuelan remembrances, culture and folklore; Mexican art and pre-Columbian imagery; as well as architecture and theater. Other works have been inspired by Greek mythology and the Commedia dell’arte. Contemporary events, such as the Vietnam War and the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., also inspired some works.

From 1974 to 1983 Sznajderman served as director of Galeria Venezuela in New York City for the National Council of Culture and Fine Arts of Venezuela (CONAC) while continuing to paint and exhibit. From 1980 to 1986 he oversaw the selection and coordination of the international editions of prints for AGPA (Actualidad Grafica – Panamericana), a project of the Latin American Container Corporation of America (later Smurfit Carton de Venezuela).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sznajderman, Marius. Wikihistoria del Arte Venezolano|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://vereda.ula.ve/wiki_artevenezolano/index.php/Sznajderman,_Marius}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout his career, Sznajderman has also explored Jewish themes, including works in remembrance of the Holocaust. In 1988 he produced a limited-edition print, in collaboration with his uncle, the Yiddish journalist and author S.L. Shneiderman, on the occasion of Shneiderman’s 80th birthday. The print featured a 1938 poem by Shneiderman, "Elegy for My Shtetl," written in Yiddish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University Libraries, University of Maryland|url=http://www.lib.umd.edu/slses/donors/poetry/elegy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Yiddish text for the print was typeset using the last linotype machine used to print the New York-based Yiddish newspaper, [[The Forward]]. In 1989 he designed and supervised the production of a Holocaust memorial monument for Temple Beth El in Hackensack, New Jersey. Other works have explored Nazi concentration and extermination camps, the Vichy government and the Holocaust in France.

For many years Sznajderman had a deep friendship and intimate creative relationship with Venezuelan painter Oswaldo Vigas. In 1987, following a trip of the two families to the Venezuelan Andes, a two-person show of landscapes by Sznajderman and Vigas was held at the venerable Ateneo de Caracas, Galeria los Espacios Calidos. 
  
In 1991 the Contemporary Art Museum of Caracas produced a retrospective exhibit of Sznajderman’s work.&lt;ref name=YivoInstitute /&gt;

In 2001 Sznajderman began a collages and collage constructions series using Yiddish as a leitmotif. A selection of the works were exhibited at the [[Yiddish Book Center]], Amherst, Massachusetts in 2005-2006.&lt;ref name=YivoInstitute /&gt;

In 2005, Venezuelan poet Hugo Brett Figueroa published the book "Scargot" with illustrations by Sznajderman. Sznajderman also illustrated the 1993 book "Who Were the Pre-Columbians?" by Bernard Barken Kaufman and "Magicismos," a book of poems by the Venezuelan poet Enrique Hernandez D’Jesus, published in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Worldcat.org|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/who-were-the-pre-columbians-mysteries-adventures-and-challenges-for-todays-world/oclc/28151996&amp;referer=brief_results}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=YivoInstitute /&gt;

In 2007, Warsaw Ghetto Revolt mural project and a Nazi concentration camp woodcut series created in 1958 and 1959, was exhibited at the Puffin Cultural Forum in Teaneck, New Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jewishstandard.timesofisrael.com|url=http://jewishstandard.timesofisrael.com/art-and-the-righteous-a-puffin-forum-exhibit/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 and 2012 he produced the "Yanaka" series of collages on paper and a large collage construction using Chiyogami - traditional Japanese printed paper - purchased in 1990 in Tokyo.

In 2011 Sznajderman created seven collages using unauthorized lithographs by Salvador Dali as material. The collages were reproduced in a limited-edition booklet titled "Dali, Dumas and Me." The booklet described a series of events involving the late painter and printmaker Jorge Dumas, who had printed the Dali lithographs. The booklet was presented in 2013 during a solo exhibit by Sznajderman in New York City at Chashama Exhibit Space. Proceeds from the exhibit benefited the World Lung Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PRLOG.org|url=https://www.prlog.org/12156563-chashama-presents-the-dali-series-art-exhibit-to-benefit-world-lung-foundation.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, Sznajderman created a series of print-collages composed from early serigraphs produced in the 1960s. He continued to work and exhibit until the final weeks of his life.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3058">'''Marks &amp; Co''', also incorrectly referred to as "Marks &amp; Company" or colloquially as "84", was a well-known antiquarian [[bookselling|bookseller]] located at [[Cambridge Circus, London|Cambridge Circus]] - 84, [[Charing Cross Road]], [[London]].

The shop was founded in the 1920s by Benjamin Marks and Mark Cohen. Cohen was persuaded to allow his name to be abbreviated in the company's name. It provided the basis for the book of correspondence between [[Helene Hanff]] and [[Frank Doel]], together with other members of the staff between 1949 and 1968, published by Hanff as ''[[84 Charing Cross Road]]''. It was later made into a stage play, television play and [[84 Charing Cross Road (film)|BAFTA-winning film]].

Marks &amp; Co closed in December 1970. 

==Famous connections==
The company built a good reputation for itself and had famous customers, including [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[Alan Brooke, 1st Viscount Alanbrooke|Lord Alanbrooke]], [[Michael Foot]], royalty and public institutions such as universities and the [[British Museum]].

Benjamin Marks' son, [[Leo Marks]], became a prominent member of the wartime organisation, [[Special Operations Executive]], specialising in [[cryptography|codes]]. His interest in the subject had been born by his father's use of book pricing codes.

==Book ring==
During  the 1930s, Marks &amp; Co were members of a then-secret and illegal "book ring", whereby a group of London book dealers declined to bid against each other at auctions.{{sfn|Steiglitz|2007|p=158}} Instead, they would steal value from the auction house and the book's owner when one of them would buy at prices kept low by the lack of competition, then the ring would bid privately between themselves and the surplus would be shared amongst the unsuccessful ring members.{{sfn|Steiglitz|2007|p=159}} The successful ring member would then sell the book, at a profit, from their store.

When the secrecy surrounding the bidding ring was broken, a scandal was threatened to be raised in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|British House of Commons]].{{sfn|Steiglitz|2007|p=160}} In order to avoid this, an undertaking was signed, at the offices of the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'', by the ring's members to bring the practice ("if it existed") to an end.

'''''Merlin''''' is a partially [[Lost work|lost]] [[epic poem]] of the [[Arthurian legend]] in which the French knight-poet [[Robert de Boron]] reworked [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s material about the legendary figure of [[Merlin]], writing in [[Old French]] sometime in either the late 12th&lt;ref name=intro/&gt; or early 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Arthurian-legend#ref266096|title=Arthurian legend|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Together with Robert's other works, ''Joseph'' and ''Perceval'', ''Merlin'' forms a trilogy centered around the [[Holy Grail]].&lt;ref name=lit/&gt;

''Merlin'' tells the stories of the origin and early life of Merlin, his role in the birth of [[King Arthur|Arthur]], and how Arthur became the king of Britain. It introduced a number of new motifs that later became popular in medieval and later Arthurian literature,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2a22CNzigcAC&amp;pg=PA99|title=Heroes and Anti-heroes in Medieval Romance|first=Neil|last=Cartlidge|publisher=DS Brewer|via=Google Books|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; also ensuring the lasting place of Merlin as a key character in the story of King Arthur.&lt;ref name=lit&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UXoqDwAAQBAJ|title=The Encyclopedia of Medieval Literature in Britain|first1=Sian|last1=Echard|first2=Robert|last2=Rouse|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|via=Google Books|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poem's medieval [[prose]] retelling and its continuations were also incorporated into the French [[chivalric romance]]s during the early 13th century, collectively known as the Prose ''Merlin''.&lt;ref name=intro&gt;{{cite web|url=http://d.lib.rochester.edu/teams/text/conlee-prose-merlin-introduction|title=Prose Merlin: Introduction |publisher=Robbins Library Digital Projects|website=d.lib.rochester.edu|author=John Conlee|date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poem==
Writing ''Merlin'' (c. 1195-1210&lt;ref name=lit/&gt;), [[Robert de Boron]] was inspired by [[Wace]]'s ''[[Roman de Brut]]'',&lt;ref name=grail&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wgjs3WVBKJkC&amp;pg=PR25|title=The History of the Holy Grail|first=Norris J.|last=Lacy|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer Ltd|via=Google Books|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=new/&gt; an [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] adaptation of [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]''.

[[File:Merlin (illustration from middle ages).jpg|thumb|Merlin dictates the story of Arthur and his knights for Blase to write down in a 13th-century illustration for the prose version, ''Estoire de Merlin'']]

The first part of the text introduces the character of Blase, a cleric and clerk who is pictured as writing down Merlin's deeds, explaining how they came to be known and preserved. In Robert's account, as in Geoffrey's ''Historia'', Merlin is begotten by an [[incubus]] demon on a virgin as an intended [[Antichrist]]. This plot is thwarted when the expectant mother informs her confessor, Blase, of her predicament; they immediately baptize the boy at birth, thus freeing him from the power of Satan and his intended destiny. The demonic legacy invests Merlin with a preternatural knowledge of the past and present, which is supplemented by God, who gives him a [[prophet]]ic knowledge of the future.

The story of ''Merlin'' is related to Robert de Boron's two other poems that also feature Merlin as an integral character.&lt;ref name=lit/&gt; First recast into prose c. 1210, the three poems (''Joseph'', ''Merlin'', and ''Perceval'') can also form the trilogy known as ''Le Roman du Graal'',&lt;ref name=grail/&gt; which tells the story of the Arthurian myth as completely rewritten for the Holy Grail: brought from the [[Middle East]] to Britain by followers of [[Joseph of Arimathea]], the Grail is eventually recovered by Arthur's knight [[Percival]] as foretold in one of the prophecies in ''Merlin''.&lt;ref name=lit/&gt;

===Synopsis===
:Note: All names and events as in the later [[Middle English]] prose version (see below).

''Merlin'' begins with the scene of a council of demons plotting to create the future Merlin as their agent on Earth to undo the work of Christ, but their plan is foiled and the mother names the child Merlin after her father. It continues with the story of the usurper king Vortiger ([[Vortigern]]) and his tower, featuring the seven-year-old Merlin with amazing prophetic powers. Following Vortiger's death, which Merlin also predicted, he assists the new king Pendragon and his brother Uter ([[Uther Pendragon]], soon himself the king as Uterpendragon after the death of the original Pendragon at [[Salisbury]]) in their bloody war against [[Saxons|Saxon]] invaders, later erecting [[Stonehenge]] as burial place for the fallen Britons and eventually inspiring the creation of the [[Round Table]].

This is followed by the account of Uter's war with the Duke of [[Tintagel]] (here unnamed, [[Gorlois]] in general Arthurian tradition) for the latter's wife Ygerne ([[Igraine]]), during which Merlin's magic enables Uter to sleep with Ygerne and conceive [[King Arthur|Arthur]], destined to become the [[Emperor of Rome]]. After Uter kills his rival and forcibly marries Ygerne, the newborn Arthur is given into the foster care of Antor ([[Sir Ector|Ector]]), while Ygerne's daughters from the previous marriage are wed to [[King Lot]] and King Ventres ([[Budic II of Brittany|Nentres]]), and her illegitimate daughter Morgan is sent away to a nunnery and becomes known as [[Morgan le Fay]] (the first account of Morgan being Igraine's daughter and learning magic in a convent&lt;ref name="Larrington, p. 41"&gt;Carolyne Larrington, ''King Arthur's Enchantresses'', p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;).

The poem seems to have ended with the later [[Excalibur|"sword in the stone" story]], in which Arthur proves he is to become Britain's high king by a divine destiny. This has been the first instance of this motif to appear in Arthurian literature; it has become iconic after being repeated almost exact in [[Sir Thomas Malory]]'s popular ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]''.&lt;ref name=intro/&gt; {{clear}}

==Prose and continuations==
The poem was rewritten in prose and extended with a lengthy sequel to become the early-13th-century romance ''Estoire de Merlin'' (''History of Merlin''), also known as the Vulgate ''Merlin'' or Prose ''Merlin'', by authors unknown (highly possibly a single author,&lt;ref name=cycle/&gt; perhaps Robert himself&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://expositions.bnf.fr/arthur/expo_uk/salle2/05.htm|title=BnF - The legend of King Arthur|website=expositions.bnf.fr|language=fr|access-date=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;). ''Estoire de Merlin'' constitutes one of the five volumes of the [[Vulgate Cycle]] / Lancelot-Grail as a probably late addition to it.&lt;ref name=cycle/&gt; The later [[Post-Vulgate Cycle]] also begins with material drawn from the poem.&lt;ref name=new2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hf6zAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA435|title=The New Arthurian Encyclopedia: New Edition (Page 435)|first=Norris J.|last=Lacy|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books|date=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first of the two sequels to ''Merlin'' are known as the Vulgate ''Suite du Merlin'', a 'historical' sequel about the various wars of Arthur and the role of Merlin in them, also focusing on [[Gawain]] as the third main character.&lt;ref name=intro/&gt; The second is the later ''Suite du Merlin'' (or a ''Merlin Continuation''), also known as the ''Suite-Huth'' or ''Huth Merlin''; a 'romantic' sequel.&lt;ref name=new/&gt;&lt;ref name=cycle&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KkBSujrlYRAC&amp;pg=PA13|title=A Companion to the Lancelot-Grail Cycle|first=Carol|last=Dover|publisher=DS Brewer|via=Google Books|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Today, the ''Suite du Merlin'' is best known as the primary source of Malory for the first four books of ''Le Morte d'Arthur'';&lt;ref name=intro/&gt;&lt;ref name=new2/&gt; the previous Vulgate ''Suite'' also served as a minor source for Malory's Roman War episode (Book II).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maloryproject.com/vulgatemerlin_intro.php|title=Malory Project - Vulgatemerlin Intro|website=www.maloryproject.com|author=Zoë Enstone}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior English translations and adaptations have included [[Henry Lovelich]]'s poem ''Merlin'', the romance ''Of Arthour and of Merlin'' (also known as just ''Arthour and Merlin''), and the poem [[Stanzaic Morte Arthur|Stanzaic ''Morte Arthur'']].

The following is the mid-15th-century English translation, with [[Modern English|modern]] conventions for punctuation and capitalization, of the poem's prose version (also reworked into the romance ''Arthour and Merlin''),&lt;ref name=new/&gt; sans the sequels:

'''Schmidt Hammer Lassen Architects''' is an international architectural firm founded by a group of Danish architects in 1986 in  [[Aarhus]], Denmark. It currently has three offices in [[Aarhus]], [[Copenhagen]], and [[Shanghai]].

The practice has a track record as designers of high-profile cultural buildings; art galleries, educational complexes and libraries. Projects include the [[Amazon Court]] office building in [[Prague]], the [[City of Westminster College]] in London, the [[University of Aberdeen]] [[Sir Duncan Rice Library]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.worldarchitecturenews.com/index.php?fuseaction=wanappln.projectview&amp;upload_id=12515|title=

|publisher=World Architecture News|accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Scotland and a number of construction projects and masterplans in China, with a total of approximately one and a half million square metres currently under development.

==History==
[[File:Katuaq2008.JPG|thumb|300px|[[Katuaq Culture Centre]] in [[Nuuk]], [[Greenland]]]]
[[File:Halmstad bibliotek-1.JPG|thumb|300px|Halmstad Library]]
[[File:Halmstad bibliotek-3.JPG|thumb|300px|Halmstad Library]]
[[File:Under Krystallen.jpg|thumb|300px|The Crystal in the [[Vesterbro, Copenhagen|Vesterbro district in Copenhagen]]]]

Schmidt Hammer Lassen Architects was established in 1986 by Morten Schmidt, Bjarne Hammer and John F. Lassen.
[[File:Den Sorte Diamant 3.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Royal Library, Denmark|Royal Library]] in Copenhagen]]
The current group of partners includes Morten Schmidt, Bjarne Hammer, John F. Lassen, Kim Holst Jensen, Kristian Lars Ahlmark, Chris Hardie and Rong Lu. Day-to-day management of the practice is the responsibility of CEO Bente Damgaard.

The practice had its major breakthrough with the [[Katuaq Culture Centre]] in [[Nuuk]], [[Greenland]], completed in 1997. The project in Nuuk was followed by first prize in the international competition for the extension of the [[Danish Royal Library]] on the harborfront in [[Copenhagen]]. Completed in 1999, the library extension, also known as the [[Danish Royal Library#Black Diamond|Black Diamond]], has become one of the practice’s most known buildings.

Another major project is the [[ARoS Aarhus Kunstmuseum|ARoS Art Museum]] in Aarhus, Denmark, which was completed in 2004. In May 2011 the art work ''Your rainbow panorama'', by [[Olafur Eliasson]], was officially unveiled on the roof top of the museum.

In 2010 Schmidt Hammer Lassen Architects won the competition to design the first permanent premises for the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC) in [[The Hague]], the Netherlands. The ICC is the first permanent, treaty-based, international criminal court established to help end impunity for the perpetrators of the most serious crimes of concern to the international community. It was founded in 2002 and has grown to the present-day size of 122 member countries. The building is designed to convey hope, trust and faith in justice.

In 2011 Schmidt Hammer Lassen established an office in [[Shanghai]], to serve their increasing client base in Asia. Current projects in progress include two new sustainable campus projects for China Mobile, a new office and culture development next to the Chinese Pavilion on the site of the 2010 Shanghai Expo, a new 1800 seat musical Theatre that forms part of a new cultural development called Dream Center and a private Art Museum on the banks of the Huang Pu River.  In nearby Ningbo the office is overseeing the Headquarters for Ningbo Daily Newspaper Corporation, a 125,000m2 cultural home for the Ningbo Trade Union, and the new Central Library for Ningbo East New Town, all due for completion in 2017.

==Philosophy==
The common denominator underlying the practice’s work is a democratic approach to an architecture focused around people, material, space and light. 

==Product design==
Schmidt Hammer Lassen Architects' work also include furniture and product designs, both as an integral part of large-scale architectural projects, such as the Black Diamond and ARoS, and as independent designs. Begun with the intention of raising the overall quality of architectural projects, '''Schmidt Hammer Lassen design''' is an independent department working on architecture-related designs and independent products with international manufacturers.

The current product range includes light fixtures for [[Philips]] Lighting, Lampas and Focus, indoor furniture [[Piiroinen]] and [[DJOB Montana]], outdoor street furniture for [[Veksoe]]. Designs include the Flakes chair, the Focus Lighting, Idea Water Fixtures and the Swan Neck. The design department also creates unique pieces such as the sculptural receptions desk at [[Danfoss]].

The firm also creates interior designs, such as the Bodil Binner Jewellery shop.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.worldarchitecturenews.com/index.php?fuseaction=wanappln.projectview&amp;upload_id=10504|title=Jewellery shop as gallery|publisher=World Architecture News|accessdate=2009-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[publishing]] and [[library science|library and information science]], the term '''serial''' is applied to materials "in any medium issued under the same title in a succession of discrete parts, usually numbered (or dated) and appearing at regular or irregular intervals with no predetermined conclusion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_S.aspx?#serial |title=Serial |work=ODLIS — Online Dictionary for Library and Information Science |publisher=Abc-Clio |date=2006-11-12 |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Periodicals ==
{{main|Periodical literature}}
In contrast to serials in general, a periodical has been defined as "A serial publication with its own distinctive title, containing a mix of articles  ... by more than one contributor, issued ... at regular stated intervals of less than a year, without prior decision as to when the final issue will appear."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_P.aspx?#periodical |title=Periodical |work=ODLIS — Online Dictionary for Library and Information Science |publisher=Abc-Clio |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Thus a periodical does not admit irregularly spaced publication times. This includes [[magazines]] and [[academic journals|journals]], but not [[proceedings]]; it also does not include [[newspapers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_N.aspx?#newspaper |title=Newspaper |work=ODLIS — Online Dictionary for Library and Information Science |publisher=Abc-Clio |date= |accessdate=2015-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her 2009 essay, ''From Darna to Zsazsa Zaturnnah: Desire and Fantasy and Other Way'', Reyes compared two Filipino superheroines existing in contemporary Philippine popular culture and literature, namely [[Darna]] and [[Zsazsa Zaturnnah]].  According to Reyes, Darna was the modern-day superheroine rooted and molded in [[Philippine folklore]] and tradition, while ZsaZsa Zaturnnah was "unarguably a postmodern text that could have emerged only in the twenty-first century, a period of awesome advances in science and technology, and/or frightening borderless wars."  Reyes's use of the phrase ''postmodern hero'' or ''postmodern text'' to describe ''ZsaZsa Zaturnnah'' the superheroine and [[graphic novel]] was further explained by Emilou Lindsay Mata Mendoza and Irene Villarin Gonzaga in their ''Visual Literacy and Popular Culture in the Philippine Literature Classroom: Teaching Filipino Literature through the Graphic Novel'', as a comparison between ''Darna'', the female superhero, and ''ZsaZsa Zaturnnah'', the [[effeminate]] superhero.  Darna was the traditional mold of a Filipino superheroine (gender-wise, a true ''female'' superhero) while ZsaZsa Zaturnnah was an "outright subversion" of the conventional form of that superheroine.  Because ZsaZsa Zaturnnah is, in reality, a [[homosexual male]] or "[[gay man]]" named ''Ada'' (from ''Adrian'') who works as a [[beautician]] (i.e. [[cosmetologist]], [[hair stylist]], [[manicurist]], and [[pedicurist]]), but is able to transform himself into "a voluptuous, red-haired Darna-like [real] woman who possesses super powers" whenever he swallows a magical stone and shouts the word "Zaturnnah".  In short, ZsaZsa Zaturnnah is ''in reality'' a man who ''literally'' experiences a [[Sex reassignment surgery|sex/]][[Sex reassignment therapy|gender change]] whenever he becomes the superheroine.&lt;ref name=Larc&gt;Mendoza, Emilou Lindsay and Irene Villarin Gonzaga.

'''''Sonic Dreams Collection''''' is a 2015 [[parody]] [[art game]] by [[Arcane Kids]] for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[OS X]]. It is an unofficial game based on [[Sega]]'s ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' franchise that compiles four [[minigames]]. The minigames are presented as unfinished ''Sonic'' games and include the [[character creation|character creator]] ''Make My Sonic''; the [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] ''Eggman Origin''; the [[interactive movie]] ''Sonic Movie Maker''; and the [[dating sim]] ''My Roommate Sonic''. They are described in-game as having been developed by a nonexistent [[Sega development studios|Sega studio]] for the [[Dreamcast]] in the late 1990s. ''Sonic Dreams Collection'' as a whole lampoons the modern ''Sonic'' [[fandom]], which is known for its peculiarities.

The game originated from concepts several individuals made during a Sonic-themed [[Valentine's Day]] event on the game-sharing website Glitch City. It was released as [[freeware]] on August 10, 2015, accompanied by a satirical [[press release]] claiming the contents were discovered in a Dreamcast [[software development kit]] Arcane Kids purchased on [[eBay]] in 2013. ''Sonic Dreams Collection'' quickly caught the attention of many [[video game journalist]]s, who were intrigued by its absurd nature and content. They characterized the game as scary and bizarre, but considered it a work people should be interested in playing and noted its commentary on the series' fandom. ''[[Geek.com]]'' went on to name ''Sonic Dreams Collection'' the best game of 2015.

==Gameplay==
In ''Sonic Dreams Collection'', the player selects one of four [[single-player]] [[parody]] [[minigame]]s based on the [[Sega]] game franchise ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]''.&lt;ref name="KSNow"&gt;{{cite web |last=Priestman |first1=Chris |title=Now we can all participate in the kitschy nightmares of Sonic fan art |url=https://killscreen.com/articles/participate-kitschy-nightmares-sonic-fan-art/ |website=[[Kill Screen]] |accessdate=June 11, 2018 |date=August 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EngadgetTribute" /&gt; Though unofficial, the minigames are presented as real, unfinished ''Sonic'' games for the [[Dreamcast]] developed by MJSTUDIO, a nonexistent [[Sega development studios|Sega development studio]], in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="KotakuFilmed" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DestructoidSucked" /&gt; They are listed in the order they are said to have been developed in, with a fictional development history provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Sonic Dreams Collection|developer=[[Arcane Kids]]|date=August 10, 2015|level=Title screen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''''Make My Sonic''''' is a [[character creation|character creator]] in which the player alters the appearance of a [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]] model. The player can change his coloration and alter the size and positioning of his limbs. After this, they select a randomly generated name.&lt;ref name="KotakuFilmed"/&gt; [[Screenshot]]s of the player's character can be uploaded to [[Twitter]].&lt;ref name="MakeMySonic"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Sonic Dreams Collection|developer=[[Arcane Kids]]|date=August 10, 2015|level=''Make My Sonic''|quote=[MJSTUDIO] believed that Sonic was versatile enough for every genre, even sci-fi. Make My Sonic was meant to create and upload avatars for use with every Dreamcast through SEGANET. Sadly, no future games supported this level of creativity. [Version 3.2] Added Twitter support}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game states ''Make My Sonic'' was MJSTUDIO's first ''Sonic'' game and was created in 1996.&lt;ref name="DestructoidSucked" /&gt; The studio apparently intended it to be compatible with the defunct Internet service [[SegaNet]] so users could import their character into supported games, believing Sonic would work in any game genre.&lt;ref name="MakeMySonic"/&gt;
* '''''Eggman Origin''''' is a vestigial [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]]&lt;ref name="KotakuFilmed" /&gt; alleged to have been created in 1997.&lt;ref name="PolyGHack" /&gt; It is initially displayed as unplayable beyond the title screen, as it requests a connection to SegaNet.&lt;ref name="KotakuFilmed" /&gt; However, by opening a separate file in the game's directory folders (Seganet[[.exe]]) and using ''Make My Sonic'' to create an avatar and "upload it to SegaNet", the player will be able to access an untextured map populated by several bipedal, egg-shaped creatures and [[Doctor Eggman]]. By feeding Eggman with worms dug up from around him on the map, he grows. After this, the player completes the game and ascends into the sky, with the number of ascensions posted on the online [[high score|leaderboard]] ''chao.garden''.&lt;ref name="PolyGHack" /&gt;
* '''''Sonic Movie Maker''''' is an [[adventure game]] in which the player is tasked with finding a camera and filming a six-second film to proceed to the following scene. The areas in which the player films are populated by [[ragdoll physics|ragdoll]] models of Sonic and other characters such as [[Tails (character)|Tails]], [[Shadow the Hedgehog|Shadow]], [[Rouge the Bat|Rouge]], or [[Blaze the Cat|Blaze]], as well as objects such as pull cords, speech bubble [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]], and [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)#Rings|rings]]. [[Level (video gaming)|Level]]s in ''Sonic Movie Maker'' include a garage, a prom dance floor, and a hospital room.&lt;ref name="KotakuFilmed" /&gt; The game states ''Sonic Movie Maker'' would have been a technological achievement but was canceled in 1998 when Sega management discovered its dark and sexual content. Similar to ''Make My Sonic'', videos the player makes can be uploaded to Twitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Sonic Dreams Collection|developer=[[Arcane Kids]]|date=August 10, 2015|level=''Sonic Movie Maker''|quote=Internal notes suggest that SEGA executives pulled the plug after learning about some of Sonic Movie Maker's darker subplots. [Version 1.2] Added Twitter video upload support}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''''My Roommate Sonic''''' is a [[virtual reality]] (VR) game presented from a [[First-person (video games)|first-person]] view. The player sits on a couch next to Sonic, with Eggman encouraging the player by [[text message]] to pursue a romantic interest in him. The minigame is also compatible with the [[Oculus Rift]] VR headset.&lt;ref name="KotakuFilmed" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PolyGConfess" /&gt; The game suggests ''My Roommate Sonic'' was canceled in 1999 because it was supposed to be used with the unreleased [[Sega VR]] headset.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Sonic Dreams Collection|developer=[[Arcane Kids]]|date=August 10, 2015|level=''My Roommate Sonic''|quote=My Roommate Sonic was a flawless first step into Virtual Reality.

''Sonic Dreams Collection'' was developed by [[Arcane Kids]], an [[independent game]] developer known for releasing joke video games like ''[[Bubsy 3D: Bubsy Visits the James Turrell Retrospective]]'' (2013) and ''[[Pokémon]] [[Millennial]] Edition'' (2014).&lt;ref name="KSCommand"&gt;{{cite web |title=This is a command: you have to play Sonic Dreams Collection |url=https://killscreen.com/articles/sonic-dreams-collection-nightmare-nostalgia/ |website=[[Kill Screen]] |accessdate=June 2, 2018 |date=August 19, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180607001609/https://killscreen.com/articles/sonic-dreams-collection-nightmare-nostalgia/ |archivedate=June 7, 2018 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PCGCurio"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Savage |first1=Phil |title=Sonic Dreams Collection is today's weird internet curio |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/sonic-dreams-collection-is-todays-weird-internet-curio/ |website=[[PC Gamer]] |accessdate=June 2, 2018 |date=August 11, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171009092539/http://www.pcgamer.com/sonic-dreams-collection-is-todays-weird-internet-curio/ |archivedate=October 9, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to designer Ben Esposito, the development team treated the game as a [[art game|work of art]].

'''''The Crystal Bucket''''' is the second selection of [[Clive James]]'s television criticism for ''[[The Observer]]'', for which the [[British Press Awards]] named him 'Critic of the Year' in 1981: "His contribution to the art and enjoyment of TV criticism over the past ten years has been immense. His work is deeply perceptive, often outrageously funny and always compulsively readable."

First published the same year, the volume covers 1976–79; its title is taken from [[Walter Raleigh]]'s ''The Passionate Man's Pilgrimage''.  It is dedicated to the poet [[Peter Porter (poet)|Peter Porter]]. The compilation ends not with a review but with a tribute to James's friend [[Joyce Grenfell]] who had died at the end of November 1979:  "Joyce Grenfell's death gave pause for thought to all who knew her. Her faith was profound. So was her humour, which was so devoid of malice that some people called her sentimental. She wasn't. She was just greatly good."

Writing in ''[[The Listener (magazine)|The Listener]]'', [[Gavin Ewart]] expressed the view that James, "didn't get where he is today just by being funny. He is humane, liberal and compassionate.... What he writes is always pertinent and always witty. We owe him a deep debt of gratitude."

'''''The Gleaners''''' (''Des glaneuses'') is an [[oil painting]] by [[Jean-François Millet]] completed in [[1857 in art|1857]].

It depicts three [[peasant]] women [[gleaning]] a field of stray stalks of [[wheat]] after the harvest. The painting is famous for featuring in a sympathetic way what were then the lowest ranks of rural society; this was received poorly by the French upper classes.

== History ==
Millet's ''The Gleaners'' was preceded by a vertical painting of the image in 1854 and an etching in 1855. Millet unveiled ''The Gleaners'' at the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] in 1857. It immediately drew negative criticism from the middle and upper classes, who viewed the topic with suspicion: one art critic, speaking for other Parisians, perceived in it an alarming intimation of "the scaffolds of [[Reign of Terror|1793]]."&lt;ref name="nyt1"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Kimmelman |first=Michael |author-link=Michael Kimmelman |date=August 27, 1999 |title= ART REVIEW; Plucking Warmth From Millet's Light |periodical=The New York Times |publication-place=New York City |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E07E2DC143BF934A1575BC0A96F958260 |accessdate=2008-01-10 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having recently come out of the [[French Revolution of 1848]], these prosperous classes saw the painting as glorifying the lower-class worker.&lt;ref name="nyt1" /&gt; To them, it was a reminder that French society was built upon the labor of the working masses, and landowners linked this working class with the growing movement of [[Socialism]].&lt;ref name="Gardner"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kleiner|first=Fred|author2=Christian J. Mamiya |edition=12|title=Gardner's Art Through the Ages|publisher=Wadsworth/Thompson Learning|year=2005|location=California|isbn=0-534-64091-5|page=857}}&lt;/ref&gt; The depiction of the working class in ''The Gleaners'' made the upper classes feel uneasy about their status. The masses of workers greatly outnumbered the members of the upper class. This disparity in numbers meant that if the lower class was to revolt, the upper class would be overturned. With the French Revolution still fresh on the minds of the upper classes, this painting was not perceived well at all.

Millet's ''The Gleaners'' was also not perceived well due to its large size, 33 inches by 44 inches, or 84 by 112 centimetres. This is huge for a painting depicting labor. Normally this size of a canvas was reserved for religious or mythological style paintings. Millet's work did not depict anything religiously affiliated, nor was there any reference to any mythological beliefs. The painting illustrated a realistic view of poverty and the working class. One critic commented that "his three gleaners have gigantic pretensions, they pose as the [[Moirai|Three Fates]] of Poverty...their ugliness and their grossness unrelieved."&lt;ref name="andrew"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~waste/timeline/story-pic1.html |title=Story behind the picture – The Gleaners |accessdate=2008-01-10 |work=University of St. Andrews}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the act of gleaning was not a new topic—representations of [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]] had existed in art—this new work was a statement on [[rural poverty]] and not Biblical piety:&lt;ref name="andrew" /&gt; there is no touch of the Biblical sense of community and compassion in the contrasting embodiments of grinding poverty in the foreground and the rich harvest in the sunlit distance beyond. The implicit irony was unsettling. After the Salon, Millet, short on money, sold his piece for 3,000 [[French franc|francs]]—below his asking price of 4,000&lt;ref name="bullet"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fratello |first=Bradley |date=December 2003 |title=France embraces Millet: the intertwined fates of The Gleaners and The Angelus |journal=The Art Bulletin |volume=85 |issue=4 |pages=685–701|doi=10.2307/3177365 |jstor=3177365 |publisher=The Art Bulletin, Vol. 85, No. 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;—after haggling with an Englishman named Binder who would not budge for his meagre counter-offer; Millet tried to keep the miserable price a secret.&lt;ref&gt;Étienne Moreau-Nélaton, ''Millet racconté par lui-même'', (Paris: 1921)&lt;/ref&gt; While ''The Gleaners'' garnered little but notoriety during his life, after his death in 1875, public appreciation of his work steadily broadened. In 1889, the painting, then owned by banker Ferdinand Bischoffsheim, sold for 300,000 francs at auction.&lt;ref name="bullet" /&gt; The buyer remained anonymous, but rumours were that the painting was coveted by an American buyer. It was announced less than a week later that Champagne powerhouse [[Pommery|Jeanne-Alexandrine Louise Pommery]] had acquired the piece, which silenced gossip on her supposed financial issues after leaving her grapes on the vines weeks longer than her competitors.

At Madame Pommery's death in 1891, and following the conditions of her will, the painting was donated to the [[Louvre]].&lt;ref name="bullet" /&gt; It now resides in the [[Musée d'Orsay]] in [[Paris]].

== Legacy ==
''The Gleaners'' is one of Millet's best known works. Its imagery of bending peasant women gleaning was paraphrased frequently in works by younger artists such as [[Camille Pissarro|Pissarro]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]], [[Georges Seurat|Seurat]], and [[Vincent van Gogh|van Gogh]].&lt;ref&gt;Pollock, Griselda. ''Millet''. London: Oresko, 1977, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian [[Robert Rosenblum]] says Millet's painting introduced "imposing new presences in the repertory of mid-century art, with endless progeny in city and country. [[Honoré Daumier|Daumier]]'s and [[Edgar Degas|Degas]]'s laundresses, and even more so [[Les raboteurs de parquet|Caillebotte's floor-scrapers]], are almost unthinkable without Millet's epic hymn to labor."&lt;ref&gt;*Rosenblum, Robert (1989). ''Paintings in the Musée d'Orsay''. New York: Stewart, Tabori &amp; Chang. p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Gleaners'' provides evidence of Millet's role as a contemporary social critic. His brutal depiction of three hunched, female paupers segregated from the laborers and the abundant crop in the distance demonstrates his attention to, if not necessarily sympathy for, the plight of the poorest members of the community around Barbizon and its larger neighbor, Chailly, as the area experienced the growing pains of French modernization. Only about thirty-five miles from the French capital (whose population doubled between 1831 and 1851), the rich, broad plain bordering the forest of Fontainebleau was among the earliest with a rail link to Paris, readily lending itself to feeding the burgeoning city. Studies tracing the transformation of rural France in the nineteenth century note that little change in peasant life occurred beyond northern France and the Paris basin until the last quarter of the century. Millet's representation of class strife on a large-scale farm was thus uniquely modern in the 1850s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fratello|first1=Bradley|title=France Embraces Millet: The Intertwined Fates of 'The Gleaners' and 'The Angelus'|journal=The Art Bulletin |date=2003|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=17&amp;sid=a8ef2419-4c55-4aae-8ef5-fc7aa220e5c3%40sessionmgr4004&amp;hid=4102&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#bib13|accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting inspired the name of the [[Gleaner Manufacturing Company]].{{citation needed|date=June 2011}}
The painting inspired, and is discussed in, the film by Agnes Varda, ''[[The Gleaners and I]]''.

'''Video art''' is an art form which relies on using [[video]] technology as a visual and audio medium. Video art emerged during the late 1960s as new consumer video technology such as [[video tape recorders]] became available outside corporate broadcasting. Video art can take many forms: recordings that are [[broadcast]]; [[installation art|installations]] viewed in galleries or museums; works streamed online, distributed as [[video tape]]s, or [[DVD]]s; and [[performances]] which may incorporate one or more [[television set]]s, [[video monitor]]s, and projections, displaying live or recorded images and sounds.&lt;ref&gt;Hartney, Mick. [http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10215 "Video art"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017023139/http://moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10215 |date=2011-10-17 }}, [[MoMA]], accessed January 31, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Video art is named for the original analog [[video tape]], which was the most commonly used recording technology in much of the form history into the 1990s. With the advent of digital recording equipment, many artists began to explore digital technology as a new way of expression.

One of the key differences between video art and theatrical cinema is that video art does not necessarily rely on many of the conventions that define theatrical cinema. Video art may not employ the use of [[actor]]s, may contain no [[dialogue]], may have no discernible [[narrative]] or [[plot (narrative)|plot]], or adhere to any of the other conventions that generally define [[motion picture]]s as entertainment. This distinction also distinguishes video art from cinema's subcategories such as [[avant garde]] cinema, [[short films]], or [[experimental film]].

==Early history==

[[Nam June Paik]], a Korean-American artist who studied in Germany, is widely regarded as a pioneer in video art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vdb.org/sites/default/files/Kate%20Horsfield%20-%20Busting%20the%20Tube;%20A%20Brief%20History%20of%20Video%20Art.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-05-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304053728/http://www.vdb.org/sites/default/files/Kate%20Horsfield%20-%20Busting%20the%20Tube;%20A%20Brief%20History%20of%20Video%20Art.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/going-out-guide/post/father-of-video-art-nam-june-paik-gets-american-art-museum-exhibit-photos/2012/12/12/c16fa980-448b-11e2-8e70-e1993528222d_blog.html|title=Nam June Paik at the Smithsonian American Art Museum opens Dec. 13|first=Maura|last=Judkis|date=12 December 2012|website=washingtonpost.com|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809041026/https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/going-out-guide/post/father-of-video-art-nam-june-paik-gets-american-art-museum-exhibit-photos/2012/12/12/c16fa980-448b-11e2-8e70-e1993528222d_blog.html|archivedate=9 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1963 [[Nam June Paik]] showed at the Galerie Parnass in [[Wuppertal]] the ''Exposition of Music – Electronic Television''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/ausstellungen/exposition-of-music/|title=Medien Kunst Netz - Exposition of Music – Electronic Television|first=Medien Kunst|last=Netz|date=9 May 2018|website=www.medienkunstnetz.de|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809001010/http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/ausstellungen/exposition-of-music/|archivedate=9 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/exhibitions/exposition-of-music/images/3/|title=Media Art Net - Exhibition unknown|first=Media Art|last=Net|date=9 May 2018|website=www.medienkunstnetz.de|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809001552/http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/exhibitions/exposition-of-music/images/3/|archivedate=9 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1963 [[Wolf Vostell]] showed the [[installation art|installation]] ''6 TV Dé-coll/age'' at the [[Smolin Gallery]] in New York and created the video ''Sun in your head'' in Cologne.

Video art is often said to have begun when Paik used his new [[Sony]] [[Portapak]] to shoot footage of [[Pope Paul VI]]'s procession through [[New York City]] in the autumn of 1965&lt;ref&gt;Laura Cumming (December 19, 2010), [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/dec/19/nam-june-paik-tate-liverpool-review Nam June Paik – review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161126202759/https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/dec/19/nam-june-paik-tate-liverpool-review |date=2016-11-26 }} Nam June Paik ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Later that same day, across town in a [[Greenwich Village]] cafe, Paik played the tapes and video art was born.

[[File:Sony AV-3400 Porta Pak Camera.jpg|thumb|A Sony AV-3400 [[Portapak]]]]

Prior to the introduction of consumer video equipment, moving image production was only available non-commercially via [[8mm film]] and [[16mm film]]. After the Portapak's introduction and its subsequent update every few years, many artists began exploring the new technology.

Many of the early prominent video artists were those involved with concurrent movements in conceptual art, performance, and experimental film. These include Americans [[Vito Acconci]], [[Valie Export]], [[John Baldessari]], [[Peter Campus]], [[Doris Totten Chase]], [[Maureen Connor]], [[Norman Cowie]], [[Dimitri Devyatkin]], [[Frank Gillette]], [[Dan Graham]], [[Gary Hill]], [[Joan Jonas]], [[Bruce Nauman]], [[Nam June Paik]], [[Bill Viola]], [[Shigeko Kubota]], [[Martha Rosler]], [[William Wegman (photographer)|William Wegman]], and many others. There were also those such as [[Steina and Woody Vasulka]] who were interested in the formal qualities of video and employed video synthesizers to create abstract works.

==In the 1970s==
Much video art in the medium's heyday experimented formally with the limitations of the video format. For example, American artist [[Peter Campus]]' ''Double Vision'' combined the video signals from two Sony [[Portapak]]s through an electronic mixer, resulting in a distorted and radically dissonant image. Another representative piece, [[Joan Jonas]]' ''[[Vertical Roll]]'', involved recording previously-recorded material of Jonas dancing while playing the videos back on a television, resulting in a layered and complex representation of mediation.

[[File:Joan Jonas Vertical Roll.jpg|thumb|left| A still from Jonas' 1972 video]]
Much video art in America was produced out of New York City, with [[The Kitchen]], founded in 1972 by [[Steina and Woody Vasulka]] (and assisted by video director [[Dimitri Devyatkin]] and Shridhar Bapat), serving as a nexus for many young artists. An early multi-channel video art work (using several monitors or screens) was ''[[Frank Gillette#Wipe Cycle.2C 1969|Wipe Cycle]]'' by [[Ira Schneider]] and [[Frank Gillette]]. ''Wipe Cycle'' was first exhibited at the Howard Wise Gallery in New York in 1969 as part of an exhibition titled "TV as a Creative Medium". An installation of nine television screens, ''Wipe Cycle'' combined live images of gallery visitors, found footage from commercial television, and shots from pre-recorded tapes. The material was alternated from one monitor to the next in an elaborate choreography.
[[File:Heuschrecken.jpg|thumb|Wolf Vostell, ''[[Grasshopper]]s'' (''Heuschrecken''), 1970 ([[installation art|Installation]] with video monitors and video camera)]]

On the West coast, the San Jose State television studios in 1970, [[Willoughby Sharp]] began the "Videoviews" series of videotaped dialogues with artists. The "Videoviews" series consists of Sharps’ dialogues with [[Bruce Nauman]] (1970), [[Joseph Beuys]] (1972), [[Vito Acconci]] (1973), [[Chris Burden]] (1973), [[Lowell Darling]] (1974), and [[Dennis Oppenheim]] (1974). Also in 1970, Sharp curated "Body Works", an exhibition of video works by [[Vito Acconci]], [[Terry Fox (artist)|Terry Fox]], [[Richard Serra]], [[Keith Sonnier]], [[Dennis Oppenheim]] and [[William Wegman (photographer)|William Wegman]] which was presented at Tom Marioni's [[Museum of Conceptual Art]], San Francisco, California.

In Europe, [[Valie Export]]'s groundbreaking video piece, "Facing a Family" (1971) was one of the first instances of television intervention and broadcasting video art. The video, originally broadcast on the Austrian television program "Kontakte" February 2, 1971,[11] shows a bourgeois Austrian family watching TV while eating dinner, creating a mirroring effect for many members of the audience who were doing the same thing. Export believed the television could complicate the relationship between subject, spectator, and television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eai.org/title.htm?id=6472|title=Electronic Arts Intermix: Facing a Family, Valie Export|work=eai.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225155438/http://eai.org/title.htm?id=6472|archivedate=2010-12-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom [[David Hall (video artist)|David Hall]]'s "TV Interruptions" (1971) were transmitted intentionally unannounced and uncredited on Scottish TV, the first artist interventions on British television.

==1980s-1990s==

As the prices of editing software decreased, the access the general public had to utilize these technologies increased. Video editing software became so readily available that it changed the way digital media artists and video artists interacted with the mediums. Different themes emerged and were explored in the artists work, such as interactivity and nonlinearity. Criticisms of the editing software focused on the freedom that was created for the artists through the technology, but not for the audience. Some artists combined physical and digital techniques to allow their audience to physically explore the digital work. An example of this is Jeffrey Shaw's "Legible City" (1988–91). In this piece the "audience" rides a stationary bicycle through a virtual images of Manhattan, Amsterdam, and Karlsrule. The images change depending on the direction of the bike handles, and the speed of the pedaler. This created a unique virtual experience for every participant.

== 2000s-Today ==
As technology and editing techniques have evolved since the emergence of video as an art form, artists have been able to experiment more with video art without using any of their own content. [[Marco Brambilla]]'s [https://vimeo.com/5082155 "Civilization" (2008)] shows this technique. Brambilla attempts to make a video version of a collage, or a "video mural" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://motionographer.com/2009/03/15/marco-brambilla-civilization/|title=Marco Brambilla: Civilization|date=2009-03-16|work=Motionographer|access-date=2018-03-03|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180331104357/http://motionographer.com/2009/03/15/marco-brambilla-civilization/|archivedate=2018-03-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by combining various clips from movies, and editing them to portray heaven and hell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.seditionart.com/marco-brambilla/civilization-hell-and-heaven|title=Civilization (Hell and Heaven) by Marco Brambilla|website=www.seditionart.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-03|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180331040630/https://www.seditionart.com/marco-brambilla/civilization-hell-and-heaven|archivedate=2018-03-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are artists today who have changed the way video art is perceived and viewed.  In 2003, [[Kalup Linzy]] created Conversations Wit De Churen II:  All My Churen, a soap opera satire that has been credited as creating the video and performance sub-genre [http://www.vulture.com/2016/04/identity-politics-that-forever-changed-art.html 'Theatre of the Self, Performing who you are'.]  Although Linzy's work is genre defying his work has been a major contribution to the medium.   [[Ryan Trecartin]], and experimental young video-artist, uses color, editing techniques and bizarre acting to portray what the New Yorker calls "a cultural watershed".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/03/24/experimental-people|title=Experimental People|last=Tomkins|first=Calvin|date=2014-03-17|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en|issn=0028-792X|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180331104254/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/03/24/experimental-people|archivedate=2018-03-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wmagazine.com/story/what-you-need-to-know-about-lizzie-fitch-and-ryan-trecartin|title=What You Need to Know About Lizzie Fitch and Ryan Trecartin, the Artists Behind Kendall and Gigi's W Cover Story|last=Solway|first=Diane|work=W Magazine|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180331040309/https://www.wmagazine.com/story/what-you-need-to-know-about-lizzie-fitch-and-ryan-trecartin|archivedate=2018-03-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trecartin played with the portrayal of identity and ended up producicng characters who "can be many people at the same time".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; When asked about his characters, Trecartin explained that he visualized that each person's identity was made up of "areas" and that they could all be very different from each other and be expressed at different times.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Ryan Trecartin is an innovative artist who has been said to have "changed the way we engage with the world and with one another"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; through video art. A series of videos made by Trecartin titled I-BE-AREA displayed this, one example is [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZR4sHDR-1XE I-BE-AREA (Pasta and Wendy M-PEGgy)], which was made public in 2008, which portrays a character named Wendy who behaves erratically. When asked about his characters, Trecartin explained that he visualized that each person's identity was made up of "areas" and that they could all be very different from each other and be expressed at different times.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Ryan Trecartin is an innovative artist who has been said to have "changed the way we engage with the world and with one another"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; through video art.  In 2008, New York Times Holland Cotter writes, 'A big difference between his work and Mr. Trecartin’s is in the degree of digital engagement. Mr. Trecartin goes wild with editing bells and whistles; Mr. Linzy does not. The plainness and occasional clunkiness of his video technique is one reason the Braswell serial ends up touching in a way that Mr. Trecartin’s buzzed-up narratives rarely are. For all their raunchy hilarity Mr. Linzy’s characters are more than cartoons; “All My Churen” is a family-values story that has a lot to do with life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/06/arts/design/06cott.html|title=Video Art Thinks Big: That’s Showbiz|last=Cotter|first=Holland|access-date=2018-08-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Performance art and Video art ==
Video art as a medium can also be combined with other forms of artistic expression such as [[Performance art]]. This combination can also be refereed to as "media and performance art" &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/themes/media-and-performance-art/performing-for-the-camera|title=MoMA {{!}} Performing for the Camera|website=www.moma.org|access-date=2018-03-03|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180331040235/https://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/themes/media-and-performance-art/performing-for-the-camera|archivedate=2018-03-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; when artists "break the mold of video and film and broaden the boundaries of art".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With increased ability for artists to obtain video cameras, performance art started being documented and shared across large amounts of audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/themes/conceptual-art/performance-into-art|title=MoMA {{!}} Performance into Art|website=www.moma.org|access-date=2018-03-03|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171215225208/https://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/themes/conceptual-art/performance-into-art|archivedate=2017-12-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists such as [[Marina Abramović|Marina Abramovic]] and [[Ulay]] experimented with video taping their performances in the 1970s and the 1980s. In a piece titled “Rest energy” (1980) both Ulay and Marina suspended their weight so that they pulled back a bow and arrow aimed at her heart, Ulay held the arrow, and Marina the bow. The piece was 4:10 which Marina described as being “a performance about complete and total trust”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.moma.org/multimedia/audio/190/1976|title=Museum of Modern Art {{!}} MoMA|website=www.moma.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-02|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180331040251/https://www.moma.org/multimedia/audio/190/1976|archivedate=2018-03-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other artists who combined Video art with Performance art used the camera as the audience. [[Kate Gilmore (artist)|Kate Gilmore]] experimented with the positioning of the camera. In her video [https://vimeo.com/99040802 “Anything” (2006)] she films her performance piece as she is constantly trying the reach the camera which is staring down at her. As the 13-minute video goes on, she continues to tie together pieces of furniture while constantly attempting to reach the camera. Gilmore added an element of struggle to her art which is sometimes self-imposed,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://landmarks.utexas.edu/video-art/kate-gilmore-0|title=Kate Gilmore {{!}} LANDMARKS|website=landmarks.utexas.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-02|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160823201836/https://landmarks.utexas.edu/video-art/kate-gilmore-0|archivedate=2016-08-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in her video [https://vimeo.com/99149001 “My love is an anchor” (2004)] she lets her foot dry in cement before attempting to break free on camera.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bates.edu/news/2009/07/01/break-on-through/|title=Break on Through|date=2009-07-01|access-date=2018-03-02|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180320230607/http://www.bates.edu/news/2009/07/01/break-on-through/|archivedate=2018-03-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilmore has said to have mimicked expression styles from the 1960s and 1970s with inspirations like Marina Abramovic as she adds extremism and struggle to her work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mocacleveland.org/exhibitions/kate-gilmore-body-work|title=Kate Gilmore: Body of Work {{!}} MOCA Cleveland|website=mocacleveland.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-03|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180320230648/http://mocacleveland.org/exhibitions/kate-gilmore-body-work|archivedate=2018-03-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some artists experimented with space when combining Video art and Performance art. [[Ragnar Kjartansson (performance artist)|Ragnar Kjartannson]], an Icelandic artist, filmed an entire music video with 9 different artists, including himself, being filmed in different rooms. All the artists could hear each other through a pair of headphones so that they could play the song together, the piece was titled "The visitors" (2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/10/28/498718095/art-star-ragnar-kjartansson-moves-people-to-tears-over-and-over|title=Art Star Ragnar Kjartansson Moves People To Tears, Over And Over|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-03-02|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180331040740/https://www.npr.org/2016/10/28/498718095/art-star-ragnar-kjartansson-moves-people-to-tears-over-and-over|archivedate=2018-03-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was founded in April 2009, after the merger of the [[William Morris Agency]] and the [[Endeavor Talent Agency|Endeavor Agency]]. WME represents artists across all media platforms, specifically movies, television, music, theatre, digital and publishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Garrahan|first=Matthew|title=Rewriting the Hollywood script|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c7fd8106-1f6f-11e1-ab49-00144feabdc0.html|accessdate= December 29, 2011| work = [[Financial Times]]|date= December 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also represents the [[NFL]] and [[NHL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://adage.com/article/madisonvine-news/entertainment-marketing-endeavor-william-morris-merger/136304/|title=What Talent-Agency Merger Could Mean for Brands |work= [[Ad Age]] |date=April 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; WME also owns the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/11/business/dealbook/ufc-sells-itself-for-4-billion.html|title=U.F.C.

==History==

===Beginnings===
{{main|William Morris Agency|Endeavor Talent Agency}}
As the entertainment industry evolved, so did WMA, which soon expanded into television, film, literature and music representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weisbord|first=Merrily|title=Our future selves : love, life, sex, and aging|year=1991|publisher=North Atlantic Books|location=Berkeley, Calif.|isbn=978-1556431456|page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Endeavor Talent Agency launched in 1995, nearly 100 years after WMA, grew rapidly to include clients from every facet of the entertainment industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Galloway | first = Stephen | title = Jeff Berg Speaks: Plans for New Agency, What Really Happened at ICM (Exclusive) | date = March 5, 2013 | publisher = The Hollywood Reporter | url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jeff-berg-new-agency-icm-426189?page=show}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2009, Endeavor was one of the fastest-growing [[Hollywood]] talent agencies, with ''[[The New York Times]]'' singling out its reputation for "quick thinking, ferocity and barely bridled ambition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cieply|first=Michael|title=Agents Replaying a Hollywood Drama|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/27/business/media/27agent.html?_r=3&amp;sq=endeavor&amp;st=cse&amp;oref=slogin&amp;scp=1&amp;pagewanted=all| work = [[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

===WME Merger===
On April 27, 2009, WMA and the Endeavor Talent Agency announced that they were forming William Morris Endeavor, or WME.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Littleton| first = Cynthia | title = WMA, Endeavor approve merger | date = April 27, 2009 | publisher = Variety | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118002879}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Endeavor executives Ari Emanuel and Patrick Whitesell were widely seen as the architects of the merger and quickly became the Co-CEOs of WME.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.laweekly.com/2009-05-28/news/william-morris-it-39-s-a-takeover-not-a-merger |title=It's A Takeover, Not A Merger |work= [[LA Weekly]] |date=May 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Emanuel was quoted in a ''[[Financial Times]]'' profile about the company, saying "We built a culture where people are rewarded for taking risks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Garrahan|first=Matthew|title=Rewriting the Hollywood script|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/c7fd8106-1f6f-11e1-ab49-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1tY1bIPHc| work = [[Financial Times]] |accessdate= April 30, 2012|date=December 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emanuel and Whitesell have implemented several leadership strategies to boost the productivity of their agents, most notably, the "Farmhouse" training program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lashinsky|first=Adam|title=Hi, It's Ari @#$%ing Emanuel, and I plan to shake up Hollywood|url=http://money.cnn.com/2013/05/23/leadership/ari-emanuel-agent.pr.fortune/index.html|publisher=Fortune|accessdate=May 23, 2013|date=May 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the merger, WME moved its headquarters into the offices of Endeavor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Finke | first = Nikki | title = WME Will Stay In Endeavor Headquarters Instead Of Moving To New Morris Building | date = October 9, 2009 | publisher = Deadline | url = http://www.deadline.com/2009/10/wme-not-moving-to-new-building-instead-will-stay-in-endeavor-headquarters/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company now takes up several floors at 9601 Wilshire Boulevard in the heart of Beverly Hills. Additionally, WME has offices in New York, London, Miami, and [[Nashville]].

=== Expansion===
Since the merger, WME has grown to include several subsidiary companies and expanded divisions. ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' named co-CEOs Ari Emanuel and Patrick Whitesell to their 2010 "Businessperson of the Year" list, acknowledging their corporate growth strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=P.N.|title=Businessperson of the Year|url=http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2010/news/companies/1011/gallery.business_person_year.fortune/50.html|publisher=Fortune|accessdate= April 30, 2012|date=November 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emanuel had previously been recognized as a 21st-century "super agent" by both ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]'', as well as an ''[[Advertising Age]]'' "Influencer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Sabbagh | first = Dan | title = Natalie Portman sparks Hollywood battle | date = March 16, 2011 | publisher = The Guardian | url = https://www.theguardian.com/business/organgrinder/2011/mar/16/natalie-portman-actor-fee}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Hampp | first = Andrew | title = Influencer: Ari Emanuel, William Morris Endeavor Agency | date = January 3, 2011 | publisher = Advertising Age | url = http://adage.com/abstract?article_id=147947}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Karmin | first = Craig | title = How a Parking Garage Stymied Hollywood's Super Agent | date = January 27, 2012 | publisher = Wall Street Journal | url = http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203363504577185142361065750.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the merger, WME helped launch the investment group Raine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lattman|first=Peter|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/09/19/ex-bankers-start-fund-to-invest-in-media/|title=Ex-Bankers Start Fund to Invest in Media| work = [[The New York Times]] |accessdate= March 29, 2011|date=September 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which aligned the company with properties like [[Vice Media]] and [[Zumba|Zumba Fitness]]. In 2010, WME partnered with RED Interactive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linkedin.com/company/red-interactive-agency|title=RED Interactive Agency|accessdate= March 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; a digital advertising agency. Two years later, they formed an alliance with the social media management firm TheAudience,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Empson|first=Rip|title=TheAudience: A Stealthy, Celeb-Driven Startup Co-founded By Sean Parker, Ari Emanuel &amp; Oliver Luckett|url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/07/26/theaudience/|publisher=Tech Crunch|accessdate=July 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; partnering with digital entrepreneur [[Sean Parker]] and executing social campaigns for properties like the [[Seth MacFarlane]] motion picture ''[[Ted (movie)|Ted]]'' and the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella Music Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barnes|first=Brooks|title=A-Listers, Meet Your Online Megaphone|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/11/business/oliver-luckett-of-theaudience-building-online-fan-bases.html?pagewanted=all|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=November 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2013 brought a strategic partnership between WME and creative music agency Jingle Punks, which creates, publishes and licenses music. WME is also an investor in the e-commerce platform [OpenSky], which was named one of America's "Most Promising Companies" by ''Forbes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=America's Most Promising Companies|url=https://www.forbes.com/companies/opensky/|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Whitesell and Emanuel were profiled in ''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]'', highlighting the company's digital growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Laporte | first = Nicole | title = WME's Agent Provocateurs Ari Emanuel And Patrick Whitesell | date = March 18, 2013 | publisher = Fast Company | url = http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/174/creative-conversations-ari-emanuel-patrick-whitesell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, WME acquired a minority stake in the creative agency [[Droga5]]. The partnership combines the companies’ advertising and entertainment resources. Founded by [[David Droga]], [[Droga5]] was named ''[[Adweek|Adweek’s]]'' 2012 Agency of the Year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Beltrone | first = Gabriel | title = Droga's Delicious World | date = December 10, 2012 | publisher = AdWeek | url = http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/drogas-delicious-world-145813=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and oversees accounts for [[Coca-Cola]], [[Motorola]] and [[Spotify]].

Describing the partnership, ''The New York Times'' wrote, “As consumers increasingly ignore traditional advertising and are bombarded with a constant stream of content, both online and offline, advertisers have been forced to find more compelling ways to get their attention. WME could help provide the answer given its substantial reach in television, publishing, music, film and theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Vega | first = Tanzina | title = William Morris to Invest in Droga5, an Ad Agency | date = July 11, 2013 | publisher = New York Times | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/12/business/media/william-morris-to-invest-in-droga5-an-ad-agency.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

On December 18, 2013, WME and [[Silver Lake Partners|Silver Lake]] announced the acquisition of  [[IMG (company)|IMG]] for $2.4 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/12/wme-silver-lake-acquire-img-worldwide/|title=UPDATE: WME Brass Welcome IMG Staffers As Acquisition Deal Closes|first=Dominic|last=Patten|date=May 7, 2014|publisher=|accessdate=November 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[WME (talent agency)|WME]]’s [[Ari Emanuel]] and [[Patrick Whitesell]] will serve as co-CEOs.

On January 21, 2015, it was announced that WME had acquired Global eSports Management (GEM), an international agency representing various [[esports]] and professional [[video game]] players and personalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Zumberge | first = Marianne | url = https://variety.com/2015/biz/news/wmeimg-acquires-global-esports-management-gaming-agency-1201410955/ | title = WME{{ndash}}IMG Acquires Global eSports Management Gaming Agency | date = January 21, 2015 | publisher = ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' | accessdate = February 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 14, 2015, WME acquired from [[Donald Trump]] the [[Miss Universe Organization]], which produces the [[Miss Universe]], [[Miss USA]] and [[Miss Teen USA]] [[beauty pageant]]s and related content. The organization sells television rights to the pageants in other countries. Financial details were not disclosed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/biz/news/donald-trump-miss-universe-wmeimg-acquisition-1201592910/|title=WME/IMG Acquires Miss Universe Organization From Donald Trump|first=Cynthia|last=Littleton|date=September 14, 2015|publisher=|accessdate=November 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 23 it was announced that WME/IMG would be partnering with [[Turner Broadcasting]] to create a televised [[esports]] league, the [[ELeague]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/turner-wme-img-esports-league-tbs-1201600921/|title=Turner, WME/IMG Form E-Sports League, With TBS to Air Live Events|first=Todd |last=Spangler |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|date=September 23, 2015 |accessdate=November 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 9, 2016, [[Zuffa, LLC]], the parent company of [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]], was sold to a group led by WME-IMG, its owner [[Silver Lake Partners]], [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts]], and [[MSD Capital]], for $4.2 billion, the largest-ever acquisition in the sports industry.&lt;ref name="nyt-ufcsold"&gt;{{cite web|title=U.F.C.

While primarily dominated by men throughout history, women have been represented in the field of comedy since the mid 1700s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.wsupress.wayne.edu/books/detail/laughing-feminism|title=Laughing Feminism Subversive Comedy in Frances Burney and Maria Edgeworth|date=2002|publisher=Wayne State University Press|last1=Bilger|first1=Audrey|accessdate=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|title=We Killed: The Rise of Women in American Comedy|date=2002|publisher=Sarah Crichton Books|last1=Kohen|first1=Yael}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Comedy]], or creative works with the intention of humor, is thought to have originated in ancient Greek theatre in 425 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YhaawA_m9SEC&amp;pg=PR9|title=Lysistrata|last=Aristophanes|date=1996-01-01|publisher=Nick Hern Books|isbn=978-1-85459-325-2|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the first figures to enter the field, however, were faced with resistance and discrimination.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.makers.com/documentary/womenincomedy|title=Women in Comedy|work=MAKERS|access-date=2017-03-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2007/01/hitchens200701|title=Why Women Aren't Funny|last=Hitchens|first=Christopher|access-date=2017-02-25|language=en|newspaper=Vanity Fair}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sense of humor in women was previously thought to have meant the ability to laugh at a man's joke, rather than tell the joke herself.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; When women did finally enter comedy (in its various forms), it was seen as niche, thus making bookings hard to come by.

Early acts were often based in the standard roles of women as a housewife and mother.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Comedy was tailored to what men would find to be both funny and non-threatening.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; As women gained slow acceptance to their presence in comedy, they were able to expand the topics that they covered.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Since then, women have made significant gains in the field, having found fame through stand-up, television, movies, and writing.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Women such as [[Amy Schumer]], [[Phyllis Diller]], [[Wanda Sykes]], [[Gina Barreca]] and many others have contributed to the world of comedy, spanning both time and medium.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As comedic license has grown, comedy has become a tool within the scope of [[feminism]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; By reclaiming a previously male-exclusive art form, female comedians are able to use patriarchal structure against itself.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Today, feminist comedy draws attention to female issues such as [[menstruation]], [[rape]], [[gender inequality]], beauty norms, and [[machismo]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; As a readily acceptable and understandable medium of communication, comedy lends itself to the feminist movement, allowing women's issues to be more wide-spread in general society.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

==Comedic forms==

===Stand-up===
Stand-up comedy is a form of comedy in which performers act in front of a live audience, creating an interactive dependency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dz-hsuL3r_QC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=stand%20up&amp;f=false|title=Look Who's Laughing: Gender and Comedy|last=Finney|first=Gail|date=1994-01-01|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9782881246449|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jokes range from short one-liners to longer monologues. The comedic form requires a takeover the stage, in order for the comedian's material to "kill."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; For women, the direct contact with the audience puts their womanhood on display. Many female comedians choose to wear loose-fitting clothing to take their femininity out of the spotlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bitchmedia.org/post/here-is-whats-scary-about-being-a-female-stand-up-comic|title=Here is What's Scary About Being a Female Stand-Up Comic. {{!}} Bitch Media|work=Bitch Media|access-date=2017-03-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late night television===
[[File:SamanthaBeeFeb2011.jpg|thumb|[[Samantha Bee]] at a [[Hudson Union Society]] event in February 2011]]
American late night television (''[[The Tonight Show]]'', ''[[The Daily Show]]'' etc...) has been dominated by white men for almost its entire existence. With the exception of ''[[Full Frontal with Samantha Bee|Full Frontal]]'' with [[Samantha Bee]], no woman has had a late night show on a major network of her own. The platform allows a variety of comedic  (monologues and shorts) and political (interviews and exposés) opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alexandra-popken/why-its-time-for-a-woman-_b_6813704.html|title=Why It's Time for a Woman to Host a Late Night Talk Show|last=Popken|first=Alexandra|date=2015-03-06|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mic.com/articles/137160/why-are-there-so-few-female-late-night-hosts#.migMKG8nY|title=Why Are There So Few Female Late-Night Hosts?|last=Mic|work=Mic|access-date=2017-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film in general, as well as comedic film, continues to show the gender imbalance of other forms of comedy. In 2014, a study found that there were 2.24 male characters for every one female character. Of the movies surveyed, only 30.9% of the speaking characters were female.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/soraya-chemaly/20-mustknow-facts-about-g_b_5869564.html|title=20 Facts Everyone Should Know About Gender Bias in Movies|last=Chemaly|first=Soraya|date=2014-09-24|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, one of the major storylines in the film industry (the romantic comedy), consistently follows traditional female roles, relegating women to simply searching for a male partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/14/romantic-comedies-failing-women_n_7026302.html|title=How Romantic Comedies Are Failing Women (And How To Fix It)|last=Karlin|first=Lily|date=2015-04-14|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2017-03-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender imbalance==
The gender imbalance between men and women can be found all over, even on Wikipedia. The page: [[list of comedians]] show a much higher number of males than females.

===In pay===
In the [[United States]], there is a large gender gap between men and women in comedy with regards to both pay and number.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ozy.com/acumen/stand-ups-gender-gap/4661|title=It's Really No Joke|last=Humphries|first=Will|work=OZY|access-date=2017-03-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, all ten of the top ten paid comedians were male, bringing in a total of $173 million.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; In 2016, one female entered the list: [[Amy Schumer]], at number two.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://etcanada.com/photos/170240/forbes-list-of-highest-paid-comedians-for-2016/#image-170249|title=Forbes’ List Of Highest-Paid Comedians For 2016|last=Crisp|first=Gavin|website=etcanada.com|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In appearances===
A study in 2017 found a large gender imbalance in UK comedic panel shows, with only 31% of the appearances. However, the same study also found marked improvement since 1989, when the statistic was 3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://strudel.org.uk/panelshows/index.html|title=UK Panel Show Gender Breakdown|website=strudel.org.uk|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the UK industry website Chortle lists 269 female comedian as compared to 1,279 male comedians.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Imbalance can also be seen at the level of the comedy club. For example, the prestigious New York comedy club [[Carolines on Broadway|Carolines]] featured 20% female performers to 80% male in 2014.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Within the writers room, gender imbalance persists. Women made up only 10 percent of writers working on the top 250 domestic grossing films of 2010 and 15 percent of writers and 18 percent of creators in prime-time television during the 2010–2011 season.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

In South Korea, of 70 comedic variety shows, 13 had all male hosts and guests, and 23 with all male hosts, meaning that more than half of these shows lack female hosts.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Only two shows had all females hosts and guests.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Shows without hosts often try to model marriages by pairing up male and female celebrities.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; While this does achieve some sense of gender balance, it uses very traditional roles.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

==Gendering of humor==
The early female figures in stand up, such as [[Phyllis Diller]], were able to enter the mainstream through their willingness to self-deprecate and declare themselves ugly. Other early female comediennes, such as [[Mae West]] and [[Helen Kane]], used [[sex appeal]] to attract male audiences. In other words, they were able to enter, but on the terms of male comedians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Queens of comedy: Lucille Ball, Phyllis Diller, Carol Burnett, Joan Rivers, and the new generation of funny women|last=Horowitz|first=Susan|publisher=Routledge|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; More modern female comedians cite a need to tailor their comedy to what men would find to be funny, with change in this mentality only coming very recently.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt;

===In stand-up===
[[Stand-up comedy|Stand up comedy]], in particular, is described as a masculine art form.&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.makers.com/documentary/womenincomedy|title=Women in Comedy|access-date=2017-02-25|language=en|newspaper=MAKERS}}&lt;/ref&gt; The words that are used to describe success are often violent, such as ''killed'' or ''annihilated.''&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; The performer must take charge of the stage, claiming it as their own via the phallic symbol of the microphone.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; The structure of joke is often centered on an attack on another party. The aggression that such an art form necessitates is encouraged in males but discouraged in females.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karen|first=Stoddard|year=1977|title="WOMEN HAVE NO SENSE OF HUMOR" AND OTHER MYTHS: A CONSIDERATION OF FEMALE STAND-UP COMICS, 1960–1976|journal=American Humor|volume=4|pages=|jstor=42594582}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discrimination against women==
In many societies around the world, a woman's role has affected her flexibility in comedy.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caliskan|first=Sevda|date=1995-01-01|title=Is There Such a Thing as Women's Humor?|journal=American Studies International|volume=33|issue=2|pages=49–59|jstor=41279344}}&lt;/ref&gt; In countries that historically view women as inferior to men, comedy is seen as a masculine discipline.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  The common perception that women aren't funny pervades all aspects of comedy, including stand-up, television, and movies.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The comedy establishment, influenced by patriarchal society, has relegated women to the "side of tears and loss." Systematic sexism can be found at the level of audience members, bookers, agents, and male comics.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2015/10/discrimination-female-comedians/|title=The unfunny things that happen to funny women|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=2017-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a powerful social tool, comedy brings women outside of the traditional role that has been defined as theirs.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Women have experience everything from [[Heckler|heckling]] audience members calling them gendered terms like bitches or sluts, to being invited to fake comedic festivals (so the organizer could have sex with the female comedian), to being introduced in roasts as the girl that "slept with one of the judges."&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==Feminist tool==
Humor has been used a tool of feminism both for its ability to point out patriarchy and the structures it creates as well as identify the common female experience.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bing|first=Janet|year=2004|title=Is Feminist Humor an Oxymoron?|url=http://digitalcommons.odu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1004&amp;context=english_fac_pubs|journal=Women and Language|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A distinction must be made between female humor and feminist humor. Female humor is self-deprecatory, turning inwards to the performer herself.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Feminist humor, by contrast, looks outwards at the societal structures that demean women. It is aggressive and pointed, using comedic language formerly reserved for men only as a tool of liberation.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Feminist humor is to be an agent of change for women by drawing attention to their lowered position in society.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Knobloch|first=Susan|date=1996-01-01|title=Review of The Unruly Woman: Gender and the Genres of Laughter|journal=Film Quarterly|volume=50|issue=2|pages=58–60|doi=10.2307/1213431|jstor=1213431}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Bing argues that for feminist humor to be most effective at its goal of change, it should be inclusive, rather than divisive.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Divisive humor, or jokes that focus on male structures or male-bashing, do not advance feminism, but rather continue to marginalize females.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Inclusive humor that riffs off of the shared experience of women, can be subversive without the negative effects of divisive humor.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Bing continues to say that when humor falls into this inclusive comedy it contributes to feminism by first, contradicting the age old stereotype that women cannot be funny, and second, by undermining the status quo.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Humor itself can be used to make strong structural changes in a society. Many times humor has been used to subvert hierarchical structures. For example, the [[Guerrilla Girls]] used humor to point out the patriarchal, unchanging nature of the Tony awards, which give the majority of their prizes to men.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; It also functions to establish an in-group (those making and understanding the joke) and an out-group (those on the receiving end).&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Through this process, humor can create solidarity within a group, but can also make another feel excluded.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; For women, this can serve to strengthen them as a community.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

==Representation worldwide==

===Bangladesh===
Outside of the United States, women have been having similar experiences in their attempts to enter field of comedy, colored by their own cultural influences. One such women is [[Farhana Muna]], a Bangladeshi Muslim comic.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Her material is focused on Bangladeshi life and culture, from parties to relatives commenting on weight loss. According to Muna, she often feels constrained by what is deemed appropriate or not for a Bangladeshi Muslim women. She must watch what she says and wears. Muna reemphasized the sentiment that there is a wider range of comedy acceptable for men. She has also faced criticism for her actions, including her choice to not wear the [[hijab]], with people calling her a bad Muslim. However, she continues her comedic work due to the community of women that she has met through it. Muna sees comedy as a collective platform of expression, a way to share her experiences in a relatable way.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/anushay-hossain/becoming-munatic-how-a-ba_b_9283354.html|title=Becoming Munatic: How a Bangladeshi Woman is Changing the Rules of Comedy Online|last=Hossain|first=Anushay|date=2016-02-22|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
Women have been on the rise in India's comedy as recently as 2016. In a country that has deeply entrenched patriarchal values, these female comedians face great amounts of cultural animosity.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scoopwhoop.com/Female-Stand-Up-Comedians-India/#.n0ztf1urd|title=These Female Comedians Are Taking The Stand-Up Industry By Storm, One Joke At A Time|last=ScoopWhoop|date=2016-04-22|work=ScoopWhoop|access-date=2017-04-07|language=En}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this discrimination women such as [[Aditi Mittal]] and [[Neeti Palta]] have found success in an industry that did not readily accept them.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

===South Korea===
In [[South Korea]], female comedians do not encounter many comedic opportunities.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/asia/korean-tv-gender-imbalance-1202019919/|title=Korean TV’s Gender Imbalance No Laughing Matter|last=Kil|first=Sonia|date=2017-04-03|work=Variety|access-date=2017-04-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only two television programs are completely hosted by females, with the other major television opportunity being couples shows. South Korean TV shows only offer gender balance when women are in gendered roles.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Producers see men as more advantageous hires as the shows' audiences are majority women. Additionally, there was a worry that audiences would react badly to strong women in television.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; As the woman's movement grows in South Korea, so too do the opportunities for women. Rather than featuring beautiful women as prizes to be won by males contestants, new shows such as ''[[Sister's Slam Dunk|Sisters' Slam Dunk]]'' (which premiered in 2016) feature women working together to solve problems.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

==Figures==
=== Phyllis Diller ===
One of the most prominent early figures in American female comedy, [[Phyllis Diller]] made her comedic debut at the Purple Onion Comedy Club in the 1950s.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/phyllis-diller-9542308#breakthrough-role|title=Phyllis Diller|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her stand-up routines focused on the problems of the suburban [[housewife]], a previous unaddressed area by male comics.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; By opening acknowledging her lack of physical attractiveness and by incorporating self-deprecation into her routines, Diller was able to enter comedy in a time when funny and attractive women were seen as threatening.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However, by confining her comedy to her inability to fulfill her traditional role, she reinforced female stereotypes rather than dismissing them.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===Joan Rivers===
[[Joan Rivers]] (active from 1959–2014) was one of the first female comedians to utilize the "talk/conversational" method, one that was suited to television talk shows.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Unlike [[Phyllis Diller]], who was quite unlike her comedic personality, the comedy of Joan Rivers more closely reflected her personality. She often drew on her own personal experiences as a self-proclaimed Jewish princess.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Unlike her predecessors, Rivers did not downplay her attractiveness, but rather incorporated it into her riffs on life as a single woman.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Still, her comedy was focused on the traditional problems of a women (trying to find a boyfriend and husband, being a good wife etc).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===Jane Curtin===
[[Jane Curtin]] was a part of the inaugural class of [[Not Ready For Prime Time Players|Not Ready for Prime Time Players]] on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in 1975. On SNL, she was the anchor for Weekend Update and started in many well known skits including ''Coneheads''.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/jane-curtin-222399|title=Jane Curtin|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2017-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Weekend Update, she served as the liberal counterpart to Dan Aykroyd’s conservative perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/womens-blog/2015/feb/16/saturday-night-live-40-eight-feminist-milestones|title=Saturday Night Live at 40: Eight feminist milestones|last=Henderson|first=Danielle|date=2015-02-16|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-04-07|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, when asked about the environment at [[Saturday Night Live]], Curtin said that female writers faced an extremely difficult battle, especially when cast member like [[John Belushi]] were actively working against them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/womens-blog/2015/feb/16/saturday-night-live-40-eight-feminist-milestones|title=Saturday Night Live at 40: Eight feminist milestones|last=Henderson|first=Danielle|date=2015-02-16|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-04-07|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; While fundamentally believing that women are not capable of humor, he also would sabotage pieces written by women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vulture.com/2011/04/jane_curtain_reveals_john_belu.html|title=Jane Curtin Says John Belushi Was a Total Sexist|date=2011-04-12|work=Vulture|access-date=2017-04-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this atmosphere, Jane Curtin had a very successful career at SNL and went on to work on sitcoms, Broadway, and various movies.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

===Tina Fey===
[[File:Amy Poehler and Tina Fey by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|Female comedians [[Tina Fey]] (left) and [[Amy Poehler]] (right) at an event from the movie ''[[Baby Mama (film)|Baby Mama]]'']]
Figures such as [[Tina Fey]] have paved the way in the modern era for large-scale growth in female comedy.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lauzen|first=Martha|date=2014-01-02|title=The Funny Business of Being Tina Fey: Constructing a (feminist) comedy |journal=Feminist Media Studies| volume=14|issue=1|pages=106–117|doi=10.1080/14680777.2012.740060|issn=1468-0777}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her public appointment as the first female head writer of [[Saturday Night Live]] placed her in a position to serve as a feminist comedy icon.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Many of her sketches became iconic, particularly her satirical portrayal of Vice Presidential Candidate [[Sarah Palin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flowers|first=Arhlene A.|last2=Young|first2=Cory L.|date=2010-01-01|title=Parodying Palin: How Tina Fey’s Visual and Verbal Impersonations Revived a Comedy Show and Impacted the 2008 Election|journal=Journal of Visual Literacy|volume=29|issue=1|pages=47–67|doi=10.1080/23796529.2010.11674673|issn=1051-144X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her comedic writing ([[Mean Girls]], [[30 Rock]], [[Bossypants]], [[Baby Mama (film)|Baby Mama]], Date Night etc...), in addition to achieving great public notice, was well received by critics.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

===Miranda Hart===
[[Miranda Hart]] is a female comedian from the UK. She is most well-known for her television series ''[[Miranda (TV series)|Miranda]].'' Her awkward and clumsy character in the show is a embodiment of all the society neuroses that women face in daily life.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2010/dec/01/miranda-hart-tv-queen-uncool|title=Miranda Hart – TV's queen of uncool|last=Cochrane|first=Kira|date=2010-12-02|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-04-07|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a style of comedy makes her into an everywoman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Gd6_BwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=miranda+hart+comedy&amp;ots=V1My1fB1Yb&amp;sig=Fsgbg21vUl-k_8m6zx_oWUIfwr4#v=onepage&amp;q=miranda%20hart%20comedy&amp;f=false|title=Twenty-first Century Feminism: Forming and Performing Femininity|last=Nally|first=C.|last2=Smith|first2=A.|date=2015-02-27|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781137492852|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hart herself sees a divide in comedy, with some using comedy as a tool to increase their coolness (others) and some using comedy as a tool for clowning around (her).&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; By staying within the clowning realm of comedy, she achieved a cult following.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

===Amy Schumer===

'''''You Can't Get Lost in Cape Town''''' was the first book by [[Zoë Wicomb]]. Published in 1987 (by [[Virago Press|Virago]] in London), it was a collection of inter-related short stories, set during the [[Apartheid]] era and partly autobiographical, the central character being a young [[Coloureds|Coloured]] woman growing up in [[South Africa]],&lt;ref name=TWWL&gt;"You Can't Get Lost in Cape Town", in Barbara Fister, ''Third World Women's Literature: A Dictionary and Guide to Materials in English'', Greenwood Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; speaking English in an Afrikaans-speaking community in [[Namaqualand]], attending the [[University of the Western Cape]], leaving for England, and authoring a collection of short stories. This work has been compared to [[V. S. Naipaul]]’s ''[[The Enigma of Arrival]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Donnelly, K. (2014). "Metafictions of development: ''The Enigma of Arrival'', ''You Can’t Get Lost in Cape Town'', and the place of the world in world literature", ''[[Journal of Commonwealth Literature]]'', 49(1), 63–80.&lt;/ref&gt; As Rob Gaylard notes, "Central to Wicomb's collection of stories is the question of identity, and intimately bound up with this are the polarities of home and exile. Significantly, the stories were written while Wicomb was in exile in England."&lt;ref name=Gaylard177&gt;Gaylard, Rob, [http://ariel.journalhosting.ucalgary.ca/ariel/index.php/ariel/article/viewFile/2790/2735 "Exile and Homecoming: Identity in Zoë Wicomb's ''You Can't Get Lost in Cape Town''"], ''ARIEL: A Review of International English Literature'' 27:1 (January 1996), p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

''You Can’t Get Lost in Cape Town'' was also published in the US in 1987 by [[Pantheon Books]], and in 2000 by [[The Feminist Press]] at [[CUNY]]. The book was translated into Italian by Maria Teresa Carbone as ''Cenere Sulla Mia Manica'' (Rome: Edizioni Lavoro, 1993), with an Introduction by Dorothy Driver, who suggests that Wicomb's stories are without precedent, that no one previously had written from the pariticular perspective a woman brought up "Coloured" in South Africa.&lt;ref name=Gaylard177 /&gt;

==Critical appraisal==
Gaylard sees the stories collectively as a kind of ''[[bildungsroman]]'', noting that "...while Wicomb's work has obvious affinities with that of [[Bessie Head]] and [[Arthur Nortje|Arthur Nortjé]] (whose poetry supplies two of the epigraphs for her collection), her stories may also gain by being viewed in the wider context of postcolonial writing. Comparison with the work of recent women writers from the Caribbean may be particularly rewarding: writers like [[Jamaica Kincaid]] and [[Michelle Cliff]] share a preoccuption with the problems of a mixed or hybridized identity; they often write about home from the perspective of exile and often appropriate first-person narrative forms in order to do so."&lt;ref&gt;Gaylard [http://ariel.journalhosting.ucalgary.ca/ariel/index.php/ariel/article/viewFile/2790/2735 (1996)], pp. 178, 187–188.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' review, "Wicomb deserves a wide American audience, on a part with [[Nadine Gordimer]] and [[J. M. Coetzee]]", while the ''[[Seattle Times]]'' stated: "Wicomb is a gifted writer, and her compressed narratives work like brilliant splinters in the mind, suggesting a rich rhythm and shape."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/You_Can_t_Get_Lost_in_Cape_Town.html?id=j6Q-ulOss2QC You Can't Get Lost in Cape Town"] at Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

Describing the book as "superb", [[Bharati Mukherjee]] wrote in her ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' review: "Ms. Wicomb's subject isn't – as American readers might expect - simple apartheid. It is the desperate search of the ''coloured'' for identity in a harshly hierarchical society. In this ''acceptance'' of apartheid and the desire to see beyond it, Ms. Wicomb follows [[William Faulkner|Faulkner]] and certainly echoes her black countryman [[Njabulo Ndebele]], who (in his recent collection, ''Fools and Other Stories'') wrote: 'Our literature ought to seek to move away from an easy preoccupation with demonstrating the obvious existence of oppression. It exists. The task is to explore how and why people can survive under such harsh conditions.' ... Ms. Wicomb's prose is vigorous, textured, lyrical.... This is a sophisticated storyteller who combines the open-endedness of contemporary fiction with the force of autobiography and the simplicity of family stories."&lt;ref&gt;Bharati Mukherjee, [https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/24/books/they-never-wanted-to-be-themselves.html "They Never Wanted To Be Themselves"], ''The New York Times'', 24 May 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;
