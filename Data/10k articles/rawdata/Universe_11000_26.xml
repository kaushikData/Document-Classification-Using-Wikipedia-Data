It is calculated as

&lt;math&gt;\mbox{ASUI} = \frac{\sum{U_i N_i}}{\sum{N_i} \times 8760} = 1- \mbox{ASAI}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;N_i&lt;/math&gt; is the number of customers and &lt;math&gt;U_i&lt;/math&gt; is the annual outage time (in hours) for location &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;. ASUI can be represented in relation to [[SAIDI]] (where annual SAIDI is given in hours) as

&lt;math&gt;\mbox{ASUI} = \frac{\mbox{SAIDI}}{8760}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Active fuel length''' is the length of the fuel material in a fuel element. This is the [[Total rod length]] minus the [[Plenum chamber|plenum]] length and end plugs.

The fuel element or assembly is arranged in an array of cells or bundles. Each bundle consists of multiple fuel rods or pins. Each fuel rod is composed of several cylindrical fuel pellets of [[enriched uranium]], typically as UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; inserted into [[Zircaloy|zirconium-alloy]] tubes. Each [[reactor core]] can be loaded with multiple bundles of these reactor bundles.

'''Alamosa photovoltaic power plant''', is an 8.22 MWp [[photovoltaic]] [[power plant]] located in [[San Luis Valley]], Colorado, USA.  The power plant was developed by [[SunEdison]], sells all output to [[Xcel Energy]], and was completed in December 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sunedison.com/press_releases.php?id=14 | title=SunEdison Activates Largest U.S. Photovoltaic Power Plant for Xcel Energy |publisher=SunEdison |date=17 December 2007 |accessdate=13 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plant occupies {{convert|83|acre}} of land, and provided enough power to supply 1400 homes in 2008. This made it the largest producer of photovoltaic power in the United States in 2008.  Colorado Xcel customers pay approximately 2% more for electricity to subsidize renewable energy projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.denverpost.com/breakingnews/ci_11299138 |title=Alamosa solar plant's success helps prove resource's viability on large scale |publisher=[[The Denver Post]] |date=24 December 2008 |accessdate=13 January 2009 |first=Steve |last=Raabe| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090129193440/http://www.denverpost.com/breakingnews/ci_11299138| archivedate= 29 January 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plant has received some criticism, saying that the amount of land used is large in comparison to the amount of power generated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vaildaily.com/article/20090103/EDITS/901019976/1021&amp;title=Vail%20Daily%27s%20view:%20Smaller%20is%20better%20with%20solar%20energy |title=Vail Daily's view: Smaller is better with solar energy |publisher=Vail Daily |date=3 January 2009 |accessdate=13 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is an expert in the area of [[heat pipes]] and a contributor to thermal-fluids engineering in [[thermal energy systems]].&lt;ref name="birthday" /&gt;&lt;ref name="asme_honors" /&gt;

==Education==
Amir Faghri received his [[Master of Science|M.S.]] and [[Ph.D.]] degrees in Mechanical Engineering from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1974 and 1976, respectively.  He received his [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] degree from [[Oregon State University]] with highest honors in 1973.&lt;ref name="birthday" /&gt;&lt;ref name="asme_honors" /&gt;&lt;ref name="uconn" /&gt;

==Technical Contributions==
Faghri is the author of five books and has published more than 350 archival technical publications, including 245  journal papers.&lt;ref name="birthday" /&gt;&lt;ref name="asme_honors" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tfc"&gt;[https://www.thermalfluidscentral.org/e-books/author-bio.php?b=37 Thermal-Fluids Central - Authors for Advanced Heat and Mass Transfer]&lt;/ref&gt; He holds eleven U.S. [[patents]] related to [[heat pipes]], energy storage devices, and [[fuel cells]].&lt;ref name="birthday" /&gt;&lt;ref name="max_jakob" /&gt; Faghri serves on the editorial boards of eight scientific journals, including the [[International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer]], the International Communications in Heat and Mass Transfer, Heat Transfer Engineering, and [[Frontiers in Heat and Mass Transfer]] in roles such as executive editor, [[editor-in-chief]], founding editor, and honorary editorial board member.&lt;ref name="birthday" /&gt;&lt;ref name="uconn"/&gt;  In the 1980s, he unraveled complex thermal problems, including [[convection]] in the presence of phase-change materials for [[thermal energy]] storage in space.&lt;ref name="birthday" /&gt;&lt;ref name="asme_honors" /&gt;  This breakthrough led to a more rational design of cooling systems for [[NASA]] and the [[U.S. Air Force]]. In the 1990s, he developed high [[heat flux]] miniature heat pipes for commercial cooling of laptop [[computer chips]], which have been a principal contributor to the ubiquitous presence of heat pipes for cooling [[microprocessor]]s in present-day laptop computers.&lt;ref name="birthday" /&gt;&lt;ref name="asme_honors" /&gt;

==Career==
Amir Faghri started his academic career at Aryamehr University (now [[Sharif University of Technology]]) in 1976. He was one of the founding faculty members and administrators who established [[Isfahan University of Technology]] in 1977. He served on the faculty of IUT until 1980 as the founding director of its Energy Division (now separated into the Mechanical Engineering and [[Chemical Engineering]] Departments). In 1981, he joined the University of California, Berkeley as a visiting professor to teach thermal and energy courses.&lt;ref name="birthday" /&gt; Following Berkeley, Faghri joined the faculty of [[Wright State University]] in 1982 and was promoted to Brage Golding Distinguished Professor in 1989. He developed a nationally recognized heat transfer group and laboratory at WSU, interacting extensively with NASA and the U.S. Air Force.&lt;ref name="birthday" /&gt;

Faghri joined the University of Connecticut in 1994 and served as Head of the Mechanical Engineering Department from 1994–1998, United Technologies Corporation Chair Professor in Thermal-Fluids Engineering from 2004–2010, and Dean of the School of Engineering from 1998–2006.&lt;ref name="birthday" /&gt;&lt;ref name="uconn" /&gt; During his tenure as Dean, he attracted corporate and alumni support to establish 17 endowed professorships, including 11 chair professorships. He increased total enrollment by 106%, increased the number of merit scholarships by approximately 200%, and added three new buildings/facilities. He also doubled the number of undergraduate degree programs from 6 to 12. Faghri was the founder of the Connecticut Global Fuel Cell Center (renamed later as the Center for Clean Energy Engineering) at the University of Connecticut.&lt;ref name="birthday" /&gt;&lt;ref name="asme_honors" /&gt;

==Honors and awards==
Amir Faghri has received many national and international honors and awards, including the [[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics]] Thermophysics Award in 1998,&lt;ref name="aiaa"&gt;[http://www.aiaa.org/tc/tp/awards/thermophysics.html American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics - Thermophysics Award]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] Heat Transfer Memorial Award in 1998,&lt;ref name="asme"&gt;[http://www.asme.org/about-asme/honors-awards/achievement-awards/heat-transfer-memorial-award American Society of Mechanical Engineering - Heat Transfer Memorial Award]&lt;/ref&gt; the ASME James Harry Potter Gold Medal in 2005,&lt;ref name="asme_medal"&gt;[http://www.asme.org/about-asme/honors-awards/achievement-awards/james-harry-potter-gold-medal American Society of Mechanical Engineering - James Harry Potter Gold Medal]&lt;/ref&gt; and the ASME/AIChE [[Max Jakob Memorial Award]] in 2010, which is considered the highest honor in the field of heat transfer.&lt;ref name="asme_honors" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jakob"&gt;[http://divisions.asme.org/HTD/Max_Jakob_Memorial_Award.cfm American Society of Mechanical Engineering - Max Jakob Memorial Award]&lt;/ref&gt; Faghri has been a longtime fellow of the ASME and an elected member of the Connecticut Academy of Science and Engineering.

'''Arsenic''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol&amp;nbsp;'''As''' and [[atomic number]]&amp;nbsp;33. Arsenic occurs in many minerals, usually in combination with [[sulfur]] and [[metal]]s, but also as a pure elemental [[crystal]]. Arsenic is a [[metalloid]]. It has various [[allotropy|allotropes]], but only the gray form, which has a metallic appearance, is important to industry.

The primary use of arsenic is in alloys of [[lead]] (for example, in [[car batteries]] and [[ammunition]]). Arsenic is a common n-type [[dopant]] in [[semiconductor]] electronic devices, and the [[optoelectronic]] compound [[gallium arsenide]] is the second most commonly used semiconductor after doped [[silicon]]. Arsenic and its compounds, especially the trioxide, are used in the production of [[pesticide]]s, treated wood products, [[herbicide]]s, and [[insecticide]]s. These applications are declining due to the toxicity of arsenic and its compounds.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;{{Ullmann|author = Grund, Sabina C. |author2 = Hanusch, Kunibert |author3 = Wolf, Hans Uwe |title = Arsenic and Arsenic Compounds|doi = 10.1002/14356007.a03_113.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[#Bacteria|A few species of bacteria]] are able to use arsenic compounds as respiratory [[metabolite]]s. Trace quantities of arsenic are an essential [[Mineral (nutrient)|dietary element]] in rats, hamsters, goats, chickens, and presumably other species. A role in human metabolism is not known.&lt;ref&gt;Anke M. Arsenic. In: Mertz W. ed., Trace elements in human and Animal Nutrition, 5th ed. Orlando, FL: Academic Press, 1986, 347–372;  Uthus E.O., Evidency for arsenical essentiality, Environ. Geochem. Health, 1992, 14:54–56; Uthus E.O., Arsenic essentiality and factors affecting its importance. In: Chappell W.R, Abernathy C.O, Cothern C.R. eds., Arsenic Exposure and Health. Northwood, UK: Science and Technology Letters, 1994, 199–208.&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[arsenic poisoning]] occurs in multicellular life if quantities are larger than needed. [[Arsenic contamination of groundwater]] is a problem that affects millions of people across the world.

The [[United States]]' [[Environmental Protection Agency]] states that all forms of arsenic are a serious risk to human health.&lt;ref name="EPA1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cfpub.epa.gov/ncer_abstracts/index.cfm/fuseaction/display.highlight/abstract/6015 |title=Biogeochemistry of Arsenic in Contaminated Soils of Superfund Sites |last1=Dibyendu |first1=Sarkar |last2=Datta |first2=Rupali |date=2007 |website=EPA |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency |access-date=25 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States' [[Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry]] ranked arsenic as number 1 in its 2001 Priority List of [[Hazardous]] Substances at [[Superfund]] sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cfpub.epa.gov/ncer_abstracts/index.cfm/fuseaction/display.highlight/abstract/6015/report/F |title=Final Report: Biogeochemistry of Arsenic in Contaminated Soils of Superfund Sites |last=Carelton |first=James |date=2007 |website=EPA |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency |access-date=25 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arsenic is classified as a Group-A [[carcinogen]].&lt;ref name="EPA1"/&gt;

=== Physical characteristics ===
[[File:SbAs lattice.png|thumb|left|Crystal structure common to [[antimony|Sb]], [[Stibarsen|AsSb]] and gray As]]

The three most common arsenic [[Allotropy|allotropes]] are gray, yellow, and black arsenic, with gray being the most common.&lt;ref name="Norman"&gt;{{cite book|title = Chemistry of Arsenic, Antimony and Bismuth|first = Nicholas C.|last = Norman|publisher = Springer|date = 1998|isbn = 978-0-7514-0389-3|url = https://books.google.com/?id=vVhpurkfeN4C|page = 50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gray arsenic (α-As, [[space group]] R{{overline|3}}m No. 166) adopts a double-layered structure consisting of many interlocked, ruffled, six-membered rings. Because of weak bonding between the layers, gray arsenic is brittle and has a relatively low [[Mohs hardness]] of 3.5. Nearest and next-nearest neighbors form a distorted octahedral complex, with the three atoms in the same double-layer being slightly closer than the three atoms in the next.&lt;ref name="Wiberg2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Biberg|first1 = Egon|last2 = Wiberg|first2 = Nils|last3 = Holleman|first3 = Arnold Frederick|title = Inorganic Chemistry|publisher = Academic Press|date = 2001|isbn = 978-0-12-352651-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This relatively close packing leads to a high density of 5.73&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Holl" /&gt; Gray arsenic is a [[semimetal]], but becomes a [[semiconductor]] with a [[bandgap]] of 1.2–1.4&amp;nbsp;eV if amorphized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Madelung, Otfried |title=Semiconductors: data handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v_8sMfNAcA4C&amp;pg=PA410|date=2004|publisher=Birkhäuser|isbn=978-3-540-40488-0|pages=410–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gray arsenic is also the most stable form. Yellow arsenic is soft and waxy, and somewhat similar to [[tetraphosphorus]] ({{chem|P|4}}). Both have four atoms arranged in a [[tetrahedral]] structure in which each atom is bound to each of the other three atoms by a single bond. This unstable allotrope, being molecular, is the most volatile, least dense, and most toxic. Solid yellow arsenic is produced by rapid cooling of arsenic vapor, {{chem|As|4}}. It is rapidly transformed into gray arsenic by light. The yellow form has a density of 1.97&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Holl" /&gt; Black arsenic is similar in structure to [[black phosphorus]].&lt;ref name="Holl" /&gt;&lt;!--10.1002/jlac.18440490302 Ueber Allotropie bei einfachen Körpern, als eine der Ursachen der Isomerie bei ihren Verbindungen (pp. 247–264)

Black arsenic can also be formed by cooling vapor at around 100–220&amp;nbsp;°C. It is glassy and brittle. It is also a poor electrical conductor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chemicool.com/elements/arsenic.html Arsenic Element Facts]. chemicool.com&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Isotopes ===
{{Main|Isotopes of arsenic}}

Arsenic occurs in nature as a [[monoisotopic element]], composed of one stable [[isotope]], &lt;sup&gt;75&lt;/sup&gt;As.&lt;ref name="NUBASE"&gt;{{cite journal| first = Audi| last = Georges|title = The NUBASE Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties| journal = Nuclear Physics A| volume = 729| pages = 3–128| publisher = Atomic Mass Data Center| date = 2003|doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001| bibcode=2003NuPhA.729....3A| last2 = Bersillon| first2 = O.| last3 = Blachot| first3 = J.| last4 = Wapstra| first4 = A. H.| url = http://hal.in2p3.fr/in2p3-00014184}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2003, at least 33 [[radioisotope]]s have also been synthesized, ranging in [[atomic mass]] from 60 to 92. The most stable of these is &lt;sup&gt;73&lt;/sup&gt;As with a [[half-life]] of 80.30&amp;nbsp;days. All other isotopes have half-lives of under one day, with the exception of &lt;sup&gt;71&lt;/sup&gt;As (''t''&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;=65.30 hours), &lt;sup&gt;72&lt;/sup&gt;As (''t''&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;=26.0 hours), &lt;sup&gt;74&lt;/sup&gt;As (''t''&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;=17.77 days), &lt;sup&gt;76&lt;/sup&gt;As (''t''&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;=1.0942 days), and &lt;sup&gt;77&lt;/sup&gt;As (''t''&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;=38.83 hours). Isotopes that are lighter than the stable &lt;sup&gt;75&lt;/sup&gt;As tend to decay by [[beta decay|β&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; decay]], and those that are heavier tend to decay by [[beta decay|β&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; decay]], with some exceptions.

At least 10 [[nuclear isomer]]s have been described, ranging in atomic mass from 66 to 84. The most stable of arsenic's isomers is &lt;sup&gt;68m&lt;/sup&gt;As with a half-life of 111&amp;nbsp;seconds.&lt;ref name="NUBASE" /&gt;

=== Chemistry ===

Arsenic has a similar electronegativity and ionization energies to its lighter congener phosphorus and as such readily forms covalent molecules with most of the nonmetals. Though stable in dry air, arsenic forms a golden-bronze tarnish upon exposure to humidity which eventually becomes a black surface layer.&lt;ref name=Greenwood552&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 552–4&lt;/ref&gt; When heated in air, arsenic [[oxidation|oxidizes]] to [[arsenic trioxide]]; the fumes from this reaction have an odor resembling [[garlic]]. This odor can be detected on striking [[arsenide]] minerals such as [[arsenopyrite]] with a hammer.&lt;ref name=Gokcen1989/&gt; It burns in oxygen to form arsenic trioxide and [[arsenic pentoxide]], which have the same structure as the more well-known phosphorus compounds, and in fluorine to give [[arsenic pentafluoride]].&lt;ref name=Greenwood552/&gt; Arsenic (and some arsenic compounds) [[sublimation (chemistry)|sublimes]] upon heating at atmospheric pressure, converting directly to a gaseous form without an intervening liquid state at {{convert|887|K|C}}.&lt;ref name="Gokcen1989" /&gt; The [[triple point]] is 3.63&amp;nbsp;MPa and {{convert|1090|K|C}}.&lt;ref name="Holl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gokcen1989" /&gt; Arsenic makes [[arsenic acid]] with concentrated [[nitric acid]], [[arsenous acid]] with dilute nitric acid, and [[arsenic trioxide]] with concentrated [[sulfuric acid]]; however, it does not react with water, alkalis, or non-oxidising acids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Arsenic |volume=2 |pages=651–654}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arsenic reacts with metals to form [[arsenide]]s, though these are not ionic compounds containing the As&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt; ion as the formation of such an anion would be highly endothermic and even the group 1 arsenides have properties of [[intermetallic]] compounds.&lt;ref name=Greenwood552/&gt; Like [[germanium]], [[selenium]], and [[bromine]], which like arsenic [[d-block contraction|succeed the 3d transition series]], arsenic is much less stable in the group oxidation state of +5 than its vertical neighbors phosphorus and antimony, and hence arsenic pentoxide and arsenic acid are potent oxidizers.&lt;ref name=Greenwood552/&gt;

== Compounds ==
{{Category see also|Arsenic compounds}}

Compounds of arsenic resemble in some respects those of [[phosphorus]] which occupies the same [[Group (periodic table)|group]] (column) of the [[periodic table]]. The most common [[oxidation state]]s for arsenic are: −3 in the [[arsenide]]s, which are alloy-like intermetallic compounds, +3 in the [[arsenite]]s, and +5 in the  [[arsenates]] and most organoarsenic compounds. Arsenic also bonds readily to itself as seen in the square As{{su|b=4|p=3−}} ions in the mineral [[skutterudite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0080-8784(01)80151-4 | title = Recent Trends in Thermoelectric Materials Research I: Skutterudites: Prospective novel thermoelectrics  | journal = Semiconductors and Semimetals | date = 2001 | last1 = Uher | first1 = Ctirad | isbn = 978-0-12-752178-7 | volume = 69 | pages = 139–253| series = Semiconductors and Semimetals  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the +3 [[oxidation state]], arsenic is typically pyramidal owing to the influence of the [[lone pair]] of [[electron]]s.&lt;ref name="Norman" /&gt;&lt;!--page 30--&gt;

=== Inorganic compounds ===

One of the simplest arsenic compound is the trihydride, the highly toxic, flammable, pyrophoric [[arsine]] (AsH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). This compound is generally regarded as stable, since at room temperature it decomposes only slowly. At temperatures of 250–300&amp;nbsp;°C decomposition to arsenic and hydrogen is rapid.&lt;ref name=Greenwood557&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 557–8&lt;/ref&gt; Several factors, such as [[humidity]], presence of light and certain [[catalyst]]s (namely [[aluminium]]) facilitate the rate of decomposition.&lt;ref name="INRS"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Institut National de Recherche et de Sécurité | title = Fiche toxicologique nº 53: Trihydrure d'arsenic | year = 2000 | url = http://www.inrs.fr/inrs-pub/inrs01.nsf/IntranetObject-accesParReference/FT%2053/$File/ft53.pdf | format = [[PDF]] | accessdate = 2006-09-06 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061126045357/http://www.inrs.fr/inrs-pub/inrs01.nsf/IntranetObject-accesParReference/FT%2053/$FILE/ft53.pdf | archivedate = 26 November 2006 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It oxidises readily in air to form arsenic trioxide and water, and analogous reactions take place with [[sulfur]] and [[selenium]] instead of [[oxygen]].&lt;ref name=Greenwood557/&gt;

Arsenic forms colorless, odorless, crystalline [[oxide]]s [[Arsenic trioxide|As&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] ("[[white arsenic]]") and [[Arsenic pentoxide|As&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]] which are [[hygroscopic]] and readily soluble in water to form acidic solutions. [[Arsenic acid|Arsenic(V) acid]] is a weak acid and the salts are called [[arsenate]]s,&lt;ref name=Greenwood572/&gt; the most common [[arsenic contamination of groundwater]], and a problem that affects many people. Synthetic arsenates include [[Scheele's Green]] (cupric hydrogen arsenate, acidic copper arsenate), [[calcium arsenate]], and [[lead hydrogen arsenate]]. These three have been used as [[agriculture|agricultural]] [[insecticide]]s and [[poison]]s.

The protonation steps between the arsenate and arsenic acid are similar to those between [[phosphate]] and [[phosphoric acid]]. Unlike [[phosphorous acid]], [[arsenous acid]] is genuinely tribasic, with the formula As(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=Greenwood572&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 572–8&lt;/ref&gt;

A broad variety of sulfur compounds of arsenic are known. Orpiment ([[arsenic trisulfide|As&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]) and realgar ([[tetraarsenic tetrasulfide|As&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]]) are somewhat abundant and were formerly used as painting pigments. In As&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, arsenic has a formal oxidation state of +2 in As&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; which features As-As bonds so that the total covalency of As is still 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webelements.com/webelements/compounds/text/As/As4S4-12279902.html|title=Arsenic: arsenic(II) sulfide compound data|accessdate=2007-12-10|publisher=WebElements.com| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071211100733/http://www.webelements.com/webelements/compounds/text/As/As4S4-12279902.html| archivedate= 11 December 2007|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both orpiment and realgar, as well as As&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, have selenium analogs; the analogous As&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is known as the mineral [[kalgoorlieite]],&lt;ref&gt;

All trihalides of arsenic(III) are well known except the astatide, which is unknown. [[Arsenic pentafluoride]] (AsF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) is the only important pentahalide, reflecting the lower stability of the +5 oxidation state; even so, it is a very strong fluorinating and oxidizing agent. (The [[Arsenic pentachloride|pentachloride]] is stable only below −50&amp;nbsp;°C, at which temperature it decomposes to the trichloride, releasing chlorine gas.&lt;ref name="Holl" /&gt;)

A large variety of organoarsenic compounds are known.

Indeed, [[cacodyl]] was the first organometallic compound known (even though arsenic is not a true metal) and was named from the Greek ''κακωδἰα'' "stink" for its offensive odor; like all arsenic compounds, it is very poisonous.&lt;ref name=Greenwood584&gt;Greenwood, p. 584&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Native arsenic.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|A large sample of native arsenic]]

Arsenic comprises about 1.5&amp;nbsp;[[Parts per million|ppm]]&amp;nbsp;(0.00015%) of the [[Earth's crust]], and is the 53rd most abundant element. Typical background concentrations of arsenic do not exceed 3&amp;nbsp;ng/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in the atmosphere; 100&amp;nbsp;mg/kg in soil; and 10&amp;nbsp;μg/L in freshwater.

The word ''arsenic'' has its origin in the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] word {{lang|arc|ܠܐ ܙܐܦܢܝܐ}} ''(al) zarniqa'',&lt;ref name="etymonline.com"&gt;{{OEtymD|arsenic|accessdate = 2010-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Persian language|Persian]] word {{lang|fa|زرنيخ}} ''zarnikh'', meaning "yellow" (literally "gold-colored") and hence "(yellow) [[orpiment]]". It was adopted into [[Greek language|Greek]] as ''arsenikon'' ({{lang|grc|ἀρσενικόν}}), a form that is [[folk etymology]], being the neuter form of the Greek word ''arsenikos'' ({{lang|grc|ἀρσενικός}}), meaning "male", "virile". The Greek word was adopted in Latin as ''arsenicum'', which in French became ''arsenic'', from which the English word arsenic is taken.&lt;ref name="etymonline.com" /&gt; Arsenic sulfides (orpiment, [[realgar]]) and oxides have been known and used since ancient times.&lt;ref name="Curiosa"&gt;{{cite journal|title = Arsenic Curiosa and Humanity|journal = The Chemical Educator |volume = 7| issue = 2|date = 2002|pages = 51–60|first = Ronald|last = Bentley|url = http://chemeducator.org/bibs/0007002/720051rb.htm|last2 = Chasteen|first2 = Thomas G.|doi=10.1007/s00897020539a}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zosimos of Panopolis|Zosimos]] (circa 300 AD) describes roasting ''sandarach'' (realgar) to obtain ''cloud of arsenic'' ([[arsenic trioxide]]), which he then [[redox|reduces]] to gray arsenic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Makers of Chemistry|author=Holmyard John Eric|publisher=Read Books|date=2007|isbn=1-4067-3275-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the symptoms of [[arsenic poisoning]] are not very specific, it was frequently used for [[murder]] until the advent of the [[Marsh test]], a sensitive chemical test for its presence. (Another less sensitive but more general test is the [[Reinsch test]].) Owing to its use by the ruling class to murder one another and its potency and discreetness, arsenic has been called the "poison of kings" and the "king of poisons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1177/0960327107084539|date = 2007|title = Arsenic neurotoxicity – a review|volume = 26|issue = 10|pages = 823–32|pmid = 18025055|journal = Human &amp; Experimental Toxicology|last1 = Vahidnia|first1 = A.|last2 = Van Der Voet|first2 = G.

[[Albertus Magnus]] (Albert the Great, 1193–1280) is believed to have been the first to isolate the element from a compound in 1250, by heating soap together with [[arsenic trisulfide]].&lt;ref name="BuildingBlocks451-3"&gt;{{cite book |last=Emsley |first=John |title=Nature's Building Blocks: An A-Z Guide to the Elements |date=2001 |isbn=0-19-850341-5|pages=43, 513, 529 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1649, [[Johann Schröder (physician)|Johann Schröder]] published two ways of preparing arsenic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PTgwAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA84|pages = 84–|title=A general system of chemical knowledge, and its application to the phenomena of nature and art|author1=(Comte)|first1=Antoine-François de Fourcroy|date=1804}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crystals of elemental (native) arsenic are found in nature, although rare.

[[Cadet's fuming liquid]] (impure [[cacodyl]]), often claimed as the first synthetic [[Organometallic chemistry|organometallic compound]], was synthesized in 1760 by [[Louis Claude Cadet de Gassicourt]] by the reaction of [[potassium acetate]] with [[arsenic trioxide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Cadet's Fuming Arsenical Liquid and the Cacodyl Compounds of Bunsen|first = Dietmar|last = Seyferth|journal = Organometallics|date = 2001|volume = 20|issue = 8|pages = 1488–1498|doi = 10.1021/om0101947|doi-access = free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Victorian era]], "arsenic" ("white arsenic" or arsenic trioxide) was mixed with [[vinegar]] and [[chalk]] and eaten by women to improve the [[complexion]] of their faces, making their skin paler to show they did not work in the fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Display Ad 48 -- no Title|last=|first=|date=13 Feb 1898|work=The Washington Post (1877-1922)|access-date=|publisher=Proquest Historical Newspapers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arsenic was also rubbed into the faces and arms of women to "improve their complexion". The accidental use of arsenic in the adulteration of foodstuffs led to [[The Bradford Sweets Poisoning|the Bradford sweet poisoning]] in 1858, which resulted in around 20 deaths.&lt;ref name="Food"&gt;{{cite journal|journal =British Food Journal|volume = 101|issue = 4|date = 1999|pages = 274–283|title = Viewpoint: the story so far: An overview of developments in UK food regulation and associated advisory committees|first = Alan|last = Turner |doi =10.1108/00070709910272141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two arsenic pigments have been widely used since their discovery – [[Paris Green]] and [[Scheele's Green]]. After the toxicity of arsenic became widely known, these chemicals were used less often as pigments and more often as insecticides. In the 1860s, an arsenic byproduct of dye production, London Purple was widely used.  This was a solid mixture of arsenic trioxide, aniline, lime, and ferrous oxide, insoluble in water and very toxic by inhalation or ingestion&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chemicalbook.com/ProductChemicalPropertiesCB71248510_EN.htm "London purple.

[[File:Roxarsone.png|thumb|[[Roxarsone]] is a controversial arsenic compound used as a feed ingredient for chickens.]]

The toxicity of arsenic to [[insect]]s, [[bacteria]], and [[fungi]] led to its use as a wood preservative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.2134/jeq2004.0173 |last1 = Rahman |first1 = F.

An increased appreciation of the toxicity of arsenic led to a ban of CCA in consumer products in 2004, initiated by the [[European Union]] and United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Environmental Chemistry: Green Chemistry and Pollutants in Ecosystems|editor = Lichtfouse, Eric|editor2 = Schwarzbauer, Jan|editor3 = Robert, Didier|date = 2004|isbn = 978-3-540-22860-8|url = https://books.google.com/?id=IDGLh_cWAIwC|chapter = Electrodialytical Removal of Cu, Cr and As from Threaded Wood|first = Eric|last = Lichtfouse |publisher = Springer|location = Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="round"&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Talanta|volume = 58|issue = 1|date = 2002|pages = 201–235|doi = 10.1016/S0039-9140(02)00268-0|title = Arsenic round the world: a review|first = Badal Kumar|last = Mandal|pmid = 18968746|last2 = Suzuki|first2 = K.

Arsenic was also used in various agricultural insecticides and poisons. For example, [[lead hydrogen arsenate]] was a common insecticide on [[fruit tree]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last = Peryea|first = F.

In the second half of the 20th century, [[monosodium methyl arsenate]] (MSMA) and [[disodium methyl arsenate]] (DSMA) – less toxic organic forms of arsenic – replaced lead arsenate in agriculture. These organic arsenicals were in turn phased out by 2013 in all agricultural activities except cotton farming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.epa.gov/oppsrrd1/reregistration/organic_arsenicals_fs.html | publisher = EPA | title = organic arsenicals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biogeochemistry of arsenic is complex and includes various adsorption and desorption processes. The toxicity of arsenic is connected to its solubility and is affected by pH. Arsenite ({{chem|AsO|3|3-}}) is more soluble than arsenate ({{chem|AsO|4|3-}}) and is more toxic; however, at a lower pH, arsenate becomes more mobile and toxic. It was found that addition of sulfur, phosphorus, and iron oxides to high-arsenite soils greatly reduces arsenic phytotoxicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crcpress.com/Trace-Elements-in-Soils-and-Plants-Third-Edition/Kabata-Pendias/p/book/9780849315756|title=Trace Elements in Soils and Plants, Third Edition|website=CRC Press|access-date=2016-08-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821154852/https://www.crcpress.com/Trace-Elements-in-Soils-and-Plants-Third-Edition/Kabata-Pendias/p/book/9780849315756|archive-date=21 August 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 study of the remains of the [[Australia]]n racehorse, [[Phar Lap]], determined that the 1932 death of the famous champion was caused by a massive overdose of arsenic.  Sydney veterinarian Percy Sykes stated, "In those days, arsenic was quite a common tonic, usually given in the form of a solution (Fowler's Solution) ... It was so common that I'd reckon 90 per cent of the horses had arsenic in their system."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2006-10-23/phar-lap-arsenic-claims-premature-expert/1292814|title=Phar Lap arsenic claims premature: expert|date=2006-10-23|website=ABC News-AU|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medical use ===

During the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, a number of arsenic compounds were used as medicines, including [[arsphenamine]] (by [[Paul Ehrlich]]) and [[arsenic trioxide]] (by [[Thomas Fowler (inventor)|Thomas Fowler]]).&lt;ref name="ITOM"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gibaud |first1=Stéphane |last2=Jaouen |first2=Gérard |title=Arsenic – based drugs: from Fowler's solution to modern anticancer chemotherapy |url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-13185-1_1 |journal=Topics in Organometallic Chemistry |date=2010 |volume=32 |pages=1–20  |doi= 10.1007/978-3-642-13185-1_1 |series=Topics in Organometallic Chemistry |isbn=978-3-642-13184-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arsphenamine, as well as [[neosalvarsan]], was indicated for [[syphilis]] and [[trypanosomiasis]], but has been superseded by modern [[antibiotics]].

=== Heredity ===

Arsenic has been linked to [[epigenetics|epigenetic changes]], heritable changes in gene expression that occur without changes in [[DNA sequence]]. These include DNA methylation, histone modification, and [[RNA]] interference. Toxic levels of arsenic cause significant DNA hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes [[p16 (gene)|p16]] and [[p53]], thus increasing risk of [[carcinogenesis]]. These epigenetic events have been studied ''in vitro'' using human [[kidney]] cells and ''in vivo'' using rat [[liver]] cells and peripheral blood [[leukocytes]] in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baccarelli|first=A.|date=2009|title=Epigenetics and environmental chemicals|journal=Current Opinion in Pediatrics |issue=2 |volume=21 |pages=243–251 |doi=10.1097/MOP.0b013e32832925cc |pmid=19663042|last2=Bollati|first2=V.|pmc=3035853}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry]] (ICP-MS) is used to detect precise levels of intracellular arsenic and other arsenic bases involved in epigenetic modification of DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nicholis|first=I.|date=2009|title=Arsenite medicinal use, metabolism, pharmacokinetics and monitoring in human hair| journal=Biochimie| pmid=19527769| doi=10.1016/j.biochi.2009.06.003 |last2=Curis |last3=Deschamps|last4=Bénazeth|volume=91|first2=E.|first3=P.|first4=S.|issue=10|pages=1260–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies investigating arsenic as an epigenetic factor can be used to develop precise biomarkers of exposure and susceptibility.

If they all consumed exactly 10 ppb arsenic in their drinking water, the previously cited multiple epidemiological study analysis would predict an additional 2,000 cases of bladder cancer alone. This represents a clear underestimate of the overall impact, since it does not include lung or skin cancer, and explicitly underestimates the exposure. Those exposed to levels of arsenic above the current WHO standard should weigh the costs and benefits of arsenic remediation.

A team of European and Indian scientists and engineers have set up six arsenic treatment plants in [[West Bengal]] based on in-situ remediation method (SAR Technology). This technology does not use any chemicals and arsenic is left in an insoluble form (+5 state) in the subterranean zone by recharging aerated water into the aquifer and developing an oxidation zone that supports arsenic oxidizing micro-organisms. This process does not produce any waste stream or sludge and is relatively cheap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.insituarsenic.org|title = In situ arsenic treatment|work=insituarsenic.org|accessdate = 2010-05-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another effective and inexpensive method to avoid arsenic contamination is to sink wells 500&amp;nbsp;feet or deeper to reach purer waters. A recent 2011 study funded by the US National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences' Superfund Research Program shows that deep sediments can remove arsenic and take it out of circulation. In this process, called ''adsorption'', arsenic sticks to the surfaces of deep sediment particles and is naturally removed from the ground water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/ngeo1283|title=Arsenic migration to deep groundwater in Bangladesh influenced by adsorption and water demand|date=2011|last1=Radloff|first1=K.

==== Hazard maps for contaminated groundwater ====
Around one-third of the world’s population drinks water from groundwater resources.

=== Redox transformation of arsenic in natural waters ===

Arsenic is unique among the trace [[metalloids]] and oxyanion-forming trace metals (e.g. As, Se, Sb, Mo, V, Cr, U, Re). It is sensitive to mobilization at pH values typical of natural waters (pH 6.5–8.5) under both oxidizing and reducing conditions. Arsenic can occur in the environment in several oxidation states (−3, 0, +3 and +5), but in natural waters it is mostly found in inorganic forms as oxyanions of trivalent arsenite [As(III)] or pentavalent arsenate [As(V)]. Organic forms of arsenic are produced by biological activity, mostly in surface waters, but are rarely quantitatively important. Organic arsenic compounds may, however, occur where waters are significantly impacted by industrial pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Smedley, P. L.|title=A review of the source, behaviour and distribution of arsenic in natural waters|doi=10.1016/S0883-2927(02)00018-5|journal=Applied Geochemistry|volume =17| issue =5|year=2002|pages =517–568|bibcode=2002ApGC...17..517S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arsenic may be solubilized by various processes. When pH is high, arsenic may be released from surface binding sites that lose their positive charge. When water level drops and [[sulfide]] minerals are exposed to air, arsenic trapped in sulfide minerals can be released into water. When organic carbon is present in water, bacteria are fed by directly reducing As(V) to As(III) or by reducing the element at the binding site, releasing inorganic arsenic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110308104034/http://www.civil.umaine.edu/macrae/arsenic_gw.htm How Does Arsenic Get into the Groundwater]. Civil and Environmental Engineering. [[University of Maine]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The aquatic transformations of arsenic are affected by pH, reduction-oxidation potential, organic matter concentration and the concentrations and forms of other elements, especially iron and manganese. The main factors are pH and the redox potential. Generally, the main forms of arsenic under oxic conditions are H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;AsO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;AsO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, HAsO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;, and AsO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt; at pH 2, 2–7, 7–11 and 11, respectively. Under reducing conditions, H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;AsO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is predominant at pH 2–9.

Oxidation and reduction affects the migration of arsenic in subsurface environments. Arsenite is the most stable soluble form of arsenic in reducing environments and arsenate, which is less mobile than arsenite, is dominant in oxidizing environments at neutral pH. Therefore, arsenic may be more mobile under reducing conditions. The reducing environment is also rich in organic matter which may enhance the solubility of arsenic compounds. As a result, the [[adsorption]] of arsenic is reduced and dissolved arsenic accumulates in groundwater. That is why the arsenic content is higher in reducing environments than in oxidizing environments.&lt;ref&gt;Zeng Zhaohua, Zhang Zhiliang (2002). "The formation of As element in groundwater and the controlling factor". Shanghai Geology 87 (3): 11–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of sulfur is another factor that affects the transformation of arsenic in natural water. Arsenic can [[precipitate]] when metal sulfides form. In this way, arsenic is removed from the water and its mobility decreases. When oxygen is present, bacteria oxidize reduced sulfur to generate energy, potentially releasing bound arsenic.

Redox reactions involving Fe also appear to be essential factors in the fate of arsenic in aquatic systems. The reduction of iron oxyhydroxides plays a key role in the release of arsenic to water. So arsenic can be enriched in water with elevated Fe concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Redox control of arsenic mobilization in Bangladesh groundwater|doi=10.1016/j.apgeochem.2003.09.007 | volume=19 |issue=2 | journal=Applied Geochemistry|pages=201–214|bibcode=2004ApGC...19..201Z|year=2004 |last1=Zheng |first1=Y |last2=Stute |first2=M |last3=Van Geen |first3=A |last4=Gavrieli |first4=I |last5=Dhar |first5=R |last6=Simpson |first6=H.J |last7=Schlosser |first7=P |last8=Ahmed |first8=K.M }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under oxidizing conditions, arsenic can be mobilized from [[pyrite]] or iron oxides especially at elevated pH. Under reducing conditions, arsenic can be mobilized by reductive desorption or dissolution when associated with iron oxides. The reductive desorption occurs under two circumstances. One is when arsenate is reduced to arsenite which adsorbs to iron oxides less strongly.  The other results from a change in the charge on the mineral surface which leads to the desorption of bound arsenic.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Mary Ann  (2007). [http://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2007/5036/pdf/sir20075036_web.pdf "The Association of Arsenic With Redox Conditions, Depth, and Ground-Water Age in the Glacial Aquifer System of the Northern United States"]. U.S. Geological Survey, Virginia. pp. 1–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some species of bacteria catalyze redox transformations of arsenic. Dissimilatory arsenate-respiring prokaryotes (DARP) speed up the reduction of As(V) to As(III). DARP use As(V) as the electron acceptor of anaerobic respiration and obtain energy to survive. Other organic and inorganic substances can be oxidized in this process. [[Chemoautotrophic]] arsenite oxidizers (CAO) and [[heterotrophic]] arsenite oxidizers (HAO) convert As(III) into As(V). CAO combine the oxidation of As(III) with the reduction of oxygen or nitrate. They use obtained energy to fix produce organic carbon from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. HAO cannot obtain energy from As(III) oxidation. This process may be an arsenic [[detoxification]] mechanism for the bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bin, Hong |year=2006|title=Influence of microbes on biogeochemistry of arsenic mechanism of arsenic mobilization in groundwater|journal= Advances in earth science |volume=21 |issue=1|pages= 77–82|url=http://www.adearth.ac.cn/EN/abstract/abstract3466.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Equilibrium thermodynamic calculations predict that As(V) concentrations should be greater than As(III) concentrations in all but strongly reducing conditions, i.e. where SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; reduction is occurring.  However, abiotic redox reactions of arsenic are slow. Oxidation of As(III) by dissolved O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a particularly slow reaction. For example, Johnson and Pilson (1975) gave [[Half-life|half-lives]] for the oxygenation of As(III) in seawater ranging from several months to a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/00139307509437429|title=The oxidation of arsenite in seawater | volume=8 |issue=2 | journal=Environmental Letters|pages=157–171|year=1975 |last1=Johnson |first1=D. L |last2=Pilson |first2=M. E. Q }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other studies, As(V)/As(III) ratios were stable over periods of days or weeks during water sampling when no particular care was taken to prevent oxidation, again suggesting relatively slow oxidation rates. Cherry found from experimental studies that the As(V)/As(III) ratios were stable in anoxic solutions for up to 3 weeks but that gradual changes occurred over longer timescales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Cherry, J.

=== Wood preservation in the US ===

As of 2002, US-based industries consumed 19,600 metric tons of arsenic. Ninety percent of this was used for treatment of wood with [[chromated copper arsenate]] (CCA).

Although discontinued, this application is also one of the most concern to the general public. The vast majority of older [[Timber treatment|pressure-treated]] wood was treated with CCA. CCA lumber is still in widespread use in many countries, and was heavily used during the latter half of the 20th century as a structural and outdoor [[building material]]. Although the use of CCA lumber was banned in many areas after studies showed that arsenic could leach out of the wood into the surrounding [[soil]] (from playground equipment, for instance), a risk is also presented by the burning of older CCA timber.

=== Bioremediation ===

Physical, chemical, and biological methods have been used to remediate arsenic contaminated water.&lt;ref name="JEM-2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jain |first=C. K. |last2=Singh |first2=R. D.  |title=Technological options for the removal of arsenic with special reference to South East Asia |doi=10.1016/j.jenvman.2012.04.016 |date=2012 |journal=Journal of Environmental Management |volume=107 |pages=1–8 |pmid=22579769}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bioremediation is said to be cost effective and environmentally friendly&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s11270-013-1722-y | title = Bioremediation of arsenic-contaminated water:  recent advances and future prospects | date = 2013 | last1 = Goering | first1 = P. | journal = Water, Air, &amp; Soil Pollution | volume = 224 | issue = 12 |page=1722| bibcode = 2013WASP..224.1722B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bioremediation of ground water contaminated with arsenic aims to convert arsenite, the toxic form of arsenic to humans, to arsenate. Arsenate (+5 oxidation state) is the dominant form of arsenic in surface water, while arsenite (+3 oxidation state) is the dominant form in hypoxic to anoxic environments. Arsenite is more soluble and mobile than arsenate. Many species of bacteria can transform arsenite to arsenate in anoxic conditions by using arsenite as an electron donor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.jhazmat.2014.10.014| title = Anaerobic arsenite oxidation with an electrode serving as the sole electron acceptor: A novel approach to the bioremediation of arsenic-polluted groundwater. | date = 2015 | last1 = Goering | first1 = P. | journal = Journal of Hazardous Materials | volume = 283 | pages = 617–622}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a useful method in ground water remediation. Another bioremediation strategy is to use plants that accumulate arsenic in their tissues via [[phytoremediation]] but the disposal of contaminated plant material needs to be considered.

Bioremediation requires careful evaluation and design in accordance with existing conditions.  Some sites may require the addition of an electron acceptor while others require microbe supplementation ([[bioaugmentation]]). Regardless of the method used, only constant monitoring can prevent future contamination.

Arsenic and many of its compounds are especially potent poisons.

=== Classification ===

Elemental arsenic and arsenic compounds are classified as "[[toxicity|toxic]]" and "dangerous for the environment" in the [[European Union]] under [[directive 67/548/EEC]].
&lt;!-- INDEX 033-001-00-X (arsenic) R23/25-50/53; S1/2-20/21-28-45-60-61 --&gt;
&lt;!-- INDEX 033-002-00-5 (other compounds) pareil --&gt;The [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] (IARC) recognizes arsenic and inorganic arsenic compounds as [[List of IARC Group 1 carcinogens|group 1 carcinogens]], and the EU lists arsenic trioxide, [[arsenic pentoxide]], and [[arsenate]] salts as category 1 [[carcinogen]]s.

Arsenic is known to cause [[Arsenic poisoning#Arsenicosis: chronic arsenic poisoning from drinking water|arsenicosis]] when present in drinking water, "the most common species being arsenate [{{chem|HAsO|4|2-}}; As(V)] and arsenite [H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;AsO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;; As(III)]".

=== Legal limits, food, and drink ===

In the United States since 2006, the maximum concentration in drinking water allowed by the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) is 10 ppb&lt;ref&gt;[http://water.epa.gov/lawsregs/rulesregs/sdwa/arsenic/regulations.cfm Arsenic Rule]. U.S. [[Environmental Protection Agency]]. Adopted 22 January 2001; effective 23 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and the FDA set the same standard in 2005 for bottled water.&lt;ref name="fda_metals"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/ChemicalContaminantsMetalsNaturalToxinsPesticides/ucm360023.htm |title=Supporting Document for Action Level for Arsenic in Apple Juice |publisher=Fda.gov |accessdate=2013-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="foodsafetynews" /&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=August 2013}} The Department of Environmental Protection for New Jersey set a drinking water limit of 5 ppb in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.nj.us/dep/dsr/arsenic/guide.htm |title=A Homeowner's Guide to Arsenic in Drinking Water |publisher=New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection |accessdate=2013-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[IDLH]] (immediately dangerous to life and health) value for arsenic metal and inorganic arsenic compounds is 5&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (5 ppb). The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] has set the [[permissible exposure limit]] (PEL) to a time-weighted average (TWA) of 0.01&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (0.01 ppb), and the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) has set the [[recommended exposure limit]] (REL) to a 15-minute constant exposure of 0.002&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (0.002 ppb).&lt;ref name=PGCH&gt;{{PGCH|0038}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PEL for organic arsenic compounds is a TWA of 0.5&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{PGCH|0039}}&lt;/ref&gt; (0.5 ppb).

In 2008, based on its ongoing testing of a wide variety of American foods for toxic chemicals,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodScienceResearch/TotalDietStudy/default.htm Total Diet Study] and [http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/ChemicalContaminants/ucm2006907.htm Toxic Elements Program]&lt;/ref&gt; the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] set the "level of concern" for inorganic arsenic apple and pear juices at 23 ppb, based on non-carcinogenic effects, and began blocking importation of products in excess of this level; it also required recalls for non-conforming domestic products.&lt;ref name="fda_metals" /&gt;  In 2011, the national ''[[Dr. Oz]]'' television show broadcast a program highlighting tests performed by an independent lab hired by the producers. Though the methodology was disputed (it did not distinguish between organic and inorganic arsenic) the tests showed levels of arsenic up to 36 ppb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kotz, Deborah |url=http://www.boston.com/community/moms/articles/2011/09/14/does_apple_juice_have_unsafe_levels_of_arsenic/ |title=Does apple juice have unsafe levels of arsenic? – The Boston Globe |publisher=Boston.com |date=14 September 2011 |accessdate=2013-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response, FDA tested the worst brand from the ''Dr.'' ''Oz'' show and found much lower levels. Ongoing testing found 95% of the apple juice samples were below the level of concern. Later testing by [[Consumer Reports]] showed inorganic arsenic at levels slightly above 10 ppb, and the organization urged parents to reduce consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://consumerist.com/2011/11/30/consumer-reports-study-finds-high-levels-of-arsenic-lead-in-apple-juice/|title=Consumer Reports Study Finds High Levels Of Arsenic &amp; Lead In Some Fruit Juice|author=Morran, Chris |publisher=consumerist.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In July 2013, on consideration of consumption by children, chronic exposure, and carcinogenic effect, the FDA established an "action level" of 10 ppb for apple juice, the same as the drinking water standard.&lt;ref name="fda_metals" /&gt;

Concern about arsenic in rice in Bangladesh was raised in 2002, but at the time only Australia had a legal limit for food (one milligram per kilogram).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2002/021122/full/news021118-11.html |title=Arsenic contamination of Bangladeshi paddy field soils: implications for rice contribution to arsenic consumption : Nature News |publisher=Nature.com |date=22 November 2002 |accessdate=2013-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn3141-tainted-wells-pour-arsenic-onto-food-crops.html#.UhPasx-37Vs |title=Tainted wells pour arsenic onto food crops |publisher=New Scientist |date=6 December 2002 |accessdate=2013-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Concern was raised about people who were eating U.S. rice exceeding WHO standards for personal arsenic intake in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Peplow, Mark |doi=10.1038/news050801-5 |title=US rice may carry an arsenic burden |journal= Nature News|date=2 August 2005 |doi-broken-date=2018-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011, the People's Republic of China set a food standard of 150 ppb for arsenic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://medicalxpress.com/news/2011-12-rice-source-arsenic-exposure.html | title = Rice as a source of arsenic exposure}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States in 2012, testing by separate groups of researchers at the Children's Environmental Health and Disease Prevention Research Center at [[Dartmouth College]] (early in the year, focusing on urinary levels in children)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/1205014/ |title=EHP – Rice Consumption and Urinary Arsenic Concentrations in U.S. Children |publisher=Ehp.niehs.nih.gov |accessdate=2013-08-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112184148/http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/1205014/ |archive-date=12 November 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Consumer Reports]] (in November)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/03/02/147781035/high-levels-of-arsenic-found-in-rice |title=High Levels Of Arsenic Found In Rice |publisher=NPR |date=2 March 2012 |accessdate=2013-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cr_rice"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2012/11/arsenic-in-your-food/index.htm |title=Arsenic in Your Food &amp;#124; Consumer Reports Investigation |publisher=Consumerreports.org |date=1 November 2012 |accessdate=2013-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; found levels of arsenic in rice that resulted in calls for the FDA to set limits.&lt;ref name="foodsafetynews"&gt;[http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2012/02/lawmakers-urge-fda-to-act-on-arsenic-standards/ Lawmakers Urge FDA to Act on Arsenic Standards].

Consumer Reports recommended: 
# That the EPA and FDA eliminate arsenic-containing fertilizer, drugs, and pesticides in food production;
# That the FDA establish a legal limit for food;
# That industry change production practices to lower arsenic levels, especially in food for children; and
# That consumers test home water supplies, eat a varied diet, and cook rice with excess water, then draining it off (reducing inorganic arsenic by about one third along with a slight reduction in vitamin content).&lt;ref name="cr_rice" /&gt;
# Evidence-based public health advocates also recommend that, given the lack of regulation or labeling for arsenic in the U.S., children should eat no more than 1.5 servings per week of rice and should not drink rice milk as part of their daily diet before age 5.&lt;ref name="berkeleywellness"&gt;{{cite web|title=Arsenic in Rice: What You Need to Know|url=http://www.berkeleywellness.com/healthy-eating/food-safety/article/arsenic-rice-should-you-worry|website=UC Berkeley Wellness|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They also offer recommendations for adults and infants on how to limit arsenic exposure from rice, drinking water, and fruit juice.&lt;ref name="berkeleywellness" /&gt;
A 2014 [[World Health Organization]] advisory conference was scheduled to consider limits of 200–300 ppb for rice.&lt;ref name="cr_rice" /&gt;

=== Ecotoxicity ===

Arsenic is bioaccumulative in many organisms, marine species in particular, but it does not appear to biomagnify significantly in food webs. In polluted areas, plant growth may be affected by root uptake of arsenate, which is a phosphate analog and therefore readily transported in plant tissues and cells. In polluted areas, uptake of the more toxic arsenite ion (found more particularly in reducing conditions) is likely in poorly-drained soils.

=== Biological mechanism ===

Arsenic's toxicity comes from the affinity of arsenic(III) oxides for [[thiol]]s. Thiols, in the form of [[cysteine]] residues and [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]] such as [[lipoic acid]] and [[coenzyme A]], are situated at the active sites of many important [[enzyme]]s.&lt;ref name=Ullmann /&gt;

Arsenic disrupts [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] production through several mechanisms. At the level of the [[citric acid cycle]], arsenic inhibits [[lipoic acid]], which is a cofactor for [[pyruvate dehydrogenase]]. By competing with phosphate, arsenate uncouples [[oxidative phosphorylation]], thus inhibiting energy-linked reduction of [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD+]], mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis. Hydrogen peroxide production is also increased, which, it is speculated, has potential to form reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress. These metabolic interferences lead to death from multi-system [[organ failure]]. The organ failure is presumed to be from [[necrotic]] cell death, not [[apoptosis]], since energy reserves have been too depleted for apoptosis to occur.&lt;ref name=Hughes&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0378-4274(02)00084-X | title = Arsenic toxicity and potential mechanisms of action | date = 2002 | last1 = Hughes | first1 = Michael F. | journal = Toxicology Letters | volume = 133 | pages = 1–16 | pmid = 12076506 | issue = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although arsenic causes toxicity it can also play a protective role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=512|publisher = McGraw-Hill|isbn = 978-0-07-138914-3|title = Casarett and Doull's Essentials of Toxicology|date = 2003| first1 = Curtis|last1 = Klaassen|last2= Watkins |first2 = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- this needs expansion--&gt;

=== Exposure risks and remediation ===

Occupational exposure and [[arsenic poisoning]] may occur in persons working in industries involving the use of inorganic arsenic and its compounds, such as wood preservation, glass production, nonferrous metal alloys, and electronic semiconductor manufacturing. Inorganic arsenic is also found in coke oven emissions associated with the smelter industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The conversion between As(III) and As(V) is a large factor in arsenic environmental contamination. According to Croal, Gralnick, Malasarn and Newman, "[the] understanding [of] what stimulates As(III) oxidation and/or limits As(V) reduction is relevant for [[bioremediation]] of contaminated sites (Croal). The study of chemolithoautotrophic As(III) oxidizers and the heterotrophic As(V) reducers can help the understanding of the oxidation and/or reduction of arsenic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Genetics of Geochemisty|journal=Annual Review of Genetics |volume=38 |date=2004 |pages=175–206|pmid=15568975 |doi=10.1146/annurev.genet.38.072902.091138|last1=Croal|first1=Laura R. |last2=Gralnick |first2=Jeffrey A. |last3=Malasarn |first3=Davin |last4=Newman |first4=Dianne K.|url=http://authors.library.caltech.edu/286/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Treatment ===

Treatment of chronic arsenic poisoning is possible. British anti-lewisite ([[dimercaprol]]) is prescribed in doses of 5&amp;nbsp;mg/kg up to 300&amp;nbsp;mg every 4&amp;nbsp;hours for the first day, then every 6&amp;nbsp;hours for the second day, and finally every 8&amp;nbsp;hours for 8 additional days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Giannini, A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15010">'''Biological photovoltaics''' ('''BPV''') is an energy-generating technology which uses oxygenic [[photoautotrophic]] organisms, or fractions thereof, to harvest light energy and produce electrical power.&lt;ref name="BOM" /&gt;  Biological photovoltaic devices are a type of biological electrochemical system, or [[microbial fuel cell]], and are sometimes also called photo-microbial fuel cells or “living solar cells”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosenbaum|first=Miriam|author2=Schröder, Uwe |author3=Scholz, Fritz |title=Utilizing the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii for microbial electricity generation: a living solar cell|journal=Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology|date=5 February 2005|volume=68|issue=6|pages=753–756|doi=10.1007/s00253-005-1915-4|pmid=15696280}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a biological photovoltaic system, electrons generated by [[Photosynthesis#Water photolysis|photolysis of water]] are transferred to an [[anode]].&lt;ref name="BR12" /&gt;  A relatively [[Electrode potential|high-potential]] reaction takes place at the [[cathode]], and the resulting potential difference drives current through an external circuit to do useful work.  It is hoped that using a living organism (which is capable of self-assembly and self-repair) as the light harvesting material, will make biological photovoltaics a cost-effective alternative to synthetic light-energy-transduction technologies such as silicon-based [[photovoltaics]].

==Principle of operation==
[[File:Diagram of electron flow in a biological photovoltaic system.jpg|thumb|right|alt=BPV system operation|An illustration of how a biological photovoltaic system operates.]]
Like other [[fuel cells]], biological photovoltaic systems are divided into anodic and cathodic half-cells.

Oxygenic photosynthetic biological material, such as purified [[photosystems]] or whole algal or [[cyanobacteria]]l cells, are employed in the anodic half-cell.  These organisms are able to use light energy to drive the [[oxidation]] of water, and a fraction of the electrons produced by this reaction are transferred to the extracellular environment, where they can be used to [[redox|reduce]] an anode.  No [[heterotrophic]] organisms are included in the anodic chamber - electrode reduction is performed directly by the photosynthetic material.

The higher electrode potential of the cathodic reaction relative to the reduction of the anode drives current through an external circuit.  In the illustration, oxygen is being reduced to water at the cathode, though other electron acceptors can be used.  If water is regenerated there is a closed loop in terms of electron flow (similar to a conventional photovoltaic system), i.e. light energy is the only net input required for production of electrical power.  Alternatively, electrons can be used at the cathode for [[electrosynthesis|electrosynthetic]] reactions that produce useful compounds, such as the reduction of protons to hydrogen gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCormick|first=Alistair J.|author2=Bombelli, Paolo |author3=Lea-Smith, David J. |author4=Bradley, Robert W. |author5=Scott, Amanda M. |author6=Fisher, Adrian C. |author7=Smith, Alison G. |author8= Howe, Christopher J. |title=Hydrogen production through oxygenic photosynthesis using the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 in a bio-photoelectrolysis cell (BPE) system|journal=Energy &amp; Environmental Science|year=2013|volume=6|issue=9|pages=2682–2690|doi=10.1039/c3ee40491a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distinctive properties===
Similar to microbial fuel cells, biological photovoltaic systems which employ whole organisms have the advantage over non-biological fuel cells and photovoltaic systems of being able to self-assemble and self-repair (i.e. the [[photosynthetic organism]] is able to reproduce itself).  The ability of the organism to store energy allows for power generation from biological photovoltaic systems in the dark, circumventing the [[electrical grid|grid]] supply and demand problems sometimes faced by conventional photovoltaics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How to lose half a trillion euros; Europe’s electricity providers face an existential threat|url=https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21587782-europes-electricity-providers-face-existential-threat-how-lose-half-trillion-euros|newspaper=The Economist|date=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, the use of photosynthetic organisms that [[carbon fixation|fix carbon dioxide]] means the 'assembly' of the light harvesting material in a biological photovoltaic system could have a negative [[carbon footprint]].

Compared to microbial fuel cells, which use heterotrophic microorganisms, biological photovoltaic systems need no input of organic compounds to supply [[reducing equivalents]] to the system.  This improves the efficiency of light-to-electricity conversion by minimising the number of reactions separating the capture of light energy and reduction of the anode.  A disadvantage of using oxygenic photosynthetic material in bioelectrochemical systems is that the production of oxygen in the anodic chamber has a detrimental effect on the [[Electrode voltage#Potential difference of a cell assembled of two electrodes|cell voltage]].

==Types of biological photovoltaic system==
Biological photovoltaic systems are defined by the type of light harvesting material that they employ, and the mode of electron transfer from the biological material to the anode.

===Light harvesting materials===
The light harvesting materials employed in biological photovoltaic devices can be categorised by their complexity; more complex materials are typically less efficient but more robust.

====Isolated photosystems====
Isolated [[photosystems]] offer the most direct connection between water photolysis and anode reduction.  Typically, photosystems are isolated and adsorbed to a conductive surface.&lt;ref name="PSII"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yehezkeli|first=Omer|author2=Tel-Vered, Ran |author3=Wasserman, Julian |author4=Trifonov, Alexander |author5=Michaeli, Dorit |author6=Nechushtai, Rachel |author7= Willner, Itamar |title=Integrated photosystem II-based photo-bioelectrochemical cells|journal=Nature Communications|date=13 March 2012|volume=3|pages=742|doi=10.1038/ncomms1741 |pmid=22415833|bibcode=2012NatCo...3E.742Y}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A soluble redox mediator (a small molecule capable of accepting and donating electrons) may be required to improve the electrical communication between photosystem and anode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kato|first=Masaru|author2=Cardona, Tanai |author3=Rutherford, A. William |author4= Reisner, Erwin |title=Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation with Photosystem II Integrated in a Mesoporous Indium–Tin Oxide Electrode|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|date=23 May 2012|volume=134|issue=20|pages=8332–8335|doi=10.1021/ja301488d |pmid=22548478}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because other cellular components required for repair are absent, biological photovoltaic systems based on isolated photosystems have relatively short lifetimes (a few hours) and often require low temperatures to improve stability.

====Sub-cellular fractions====
Sub-cellular fractions of photosynthetic organisms, such as purified [[thylakoid membranes]], can also be used in biological photovoltaic systems.&lt;ref name=BOM&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bombelli|first=Paolo |author2=Bradley, Robert W. |author3=Scott, Amanda M. |author4=Philips, Alexander J. |author5=McCormick, Alistair J. |author6=Cruz, Sonia M. |author7=Anderson, Alexander |author8=Yunus, Kamran |author9=Bendall, Derek S. |author10=Cameron, Petra J. |author11=Davies, Julia M. |author12=Smith, Alison G. |author13=Howe, Christopher J. |author14=Fisher, Adrian C. |title=Quantitative analysis of the factors limiting solar power transduction by Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 in biological photovoltaic devices|journal=Energy &amp; Environmental Science|year=2011|volume=4|issue=11|pages=4690–4698|doi=10.1039/c1ee02531g}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A benefit of using material that contains both [[photosystem II]] and [[photosystem I]] is that electrons extracted from water by photosystem II can be donated to the anode at a more negative redox potential (from the reductive end of photosystem I).  A redox mediator (e.g. [[ferricyanide]]) is required to transfer electrons between the photosynthetic components and the anode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carpentier|first=Robert|author2=Lemieux, Sylvie |author3=Mimeault, Murielle |author4=Purcell, Marc |author5= Goetze, D.Christopher |title=A photoelectrochemical cell using immobilized photosynthetic membranes|journal=Bioelectrochemistry and Bioenergetics|date=December 1989|volume=22|issue=3|pages=391–401|doi=10.1016/0302-4598(89)87055-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Whole organisms====
[[File:Planktonic biological photovoltaic device, front and rear views.jpg|thumb|right|alt=BPV system employing whole cyanobacteria|This biological photovoltaic system uses cyanobacterium growing in suspension, with an [[indium tin oxide]] anode.]]
Biological photovoltaic systems that employ whole organisms are the most robust type, and lifetimes of multiple months have been observed.&lt;ref name="AJM"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCormick|first=Alistair J.|author2=Bombelli, Paolo |author3=Scott, Amanda M. |author4=Philips, Alexander J. |author5=Smith, Alison G. |author6=Fisher, Adrian C. |author7= Howe, Christopher J. |title=Photosynthetic biofilms in pure culture harness solar energy in a mediatorless bio-photovoltaic cell (BPV) system|journal=Energy &amp; Environmental Science|year=2011|volume=4|issue=11|pages=4699-5710|doi=10.1039/c1ee01965a}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[electrical insulator|insulating]] [[outer mitochondrial membrane|outer membranes]] of whole cells impedes electron transfer from the sites of electron generation inside the cell to the anode.&lt;ref name="BR12"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bradley|first=Robert W.|author2=Bombelli, Paolo |author3=Rowden, Stephen J.L. |author4= Howe, Christopher J. |title=Biological photovoltaics: intra- and extra-cellular electron transport by cyanobacteria|journal=Biochemical Society Transactions|date=December 2012|volume=40|issue=6|pages=1302–1307|doi=10.1042/BST20120118 |pmid=23176472}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, conversion efficiencies are low unless lipid-soluble redox mediators are included in the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Torimura|first=Masaki |author2=Miki, Atsushi |author3=Wadano, Akira |author4=Kano, Kenji |author5=Ikeda, Tokuji |title=Electrochemical investigation of cyanobacteria Synechococcus sp. PCC7942-catalyzed photoreduction of exogenous quinones and photoelectrochemical oxidation of water|journal=Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry|date=January 2001|volume=496|issue=1–2|pages=21–28|doi=10.1016/S0022-0728(00)00253-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cyanobacteria]] are typically used in these systems because their relatively simple arrangement of intracellular membranes compared to [[eukaryotic]] algae facilitates electron export.Potential catalysts such as platinum can be used to increase permeability of the cellular membrane.

===Electron transfer to the anode===
Reduction of the anode by the photosynthetic material can be achieved by a direct electron transfer, or via a soluble redox mediator.  Redox mediators may be lipid-soluble (e.g. [[vitamin K2]]), allowing them to pass through cell membranes, and can either be added to the system or produced by the biological material.

====Inherent electrode reduction activity====
Isolated photosystems and sub-cellular photosynthetic fractions may be able to directly reduce the anode if the biological redox components are close enough to the electrode for [[electron transfer]] to occur.&lt;ref name="PSII" /&gt;  In contrast to organisms such as [[Shewanella oneidensis#Applications in Metal Reduction|dissimilatory metal reducing bacteria]], algae and cyanobacteria are poorly [[adaptation|adapted]] for extracellular electron export - no molecular mechanisms enabling direct reduction of an insoluble extracellular electron acceptor have been conclusively identified.  Nevertheless, a low rate of anode reduction has been observed from whole photosynthetic organisms without the addition of exogenous redox-active compounds.&lt;ref name="AJM" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zou|first=Yongjin|author2=Pisciotta, John |author3=Billmyre, R. Blake |author4= Baskakov, Ilia V. |title=Photosynthetic microbial fuel cells with positive light response|journal=Biotechnology and Bioengineering|date=1 December 2009|volume=104|issue=5|pages=939–946|doi=10.1002/bit.22466}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been speculated that electron transfer occurs through the release of low concentrations of endogenous redox mediator compounds.  Improving the electron export activity of cyanobacteria for use in biological photovoltaic systems is a topic of current research.&lt;ref name="BR13"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bradley|first=Robert W.|author2=Bombelli, Paolo |author3=Lea-Smith, David J. |author4= Howe, Christopher J. |title=Terminal oxidase mutants of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 show increased electrogenic activity in biological photo-voltaic systems|journal=Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics|year=2013|volume=15|issue=32|pages=13611–13618|doi=10.1039/c3cp52438h|bibcode=2013PCCP...1513611B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Artificial electron mediators====
Redox mediators are often added to experimental systems to improve the rate of electron export from the biological material and/or electron transfer to the anode, especially when whole cells are employed as the light harvesting material.  [[Quinones]], [[phenazines]], and [[viologens]] have all been successfully employed to increase current output from photosynthetic oranisms in biological photovoltaic devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ochiai|first=Hideo|author2=Shibata, Hitoshi |author3=Sawa, Yoshihiro |author4=Shoga, Mitsuru |author5= Ohta, Souichi |title=Properties of semiconductor electrodes coated with living films of cyanobacteria|journal=Applied Biochemistry and Biotechnology|date=August 1983|volume=8|issue=4|pages=289–303|doi=10.1007/BF02779496}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Adding artificial mediators is considered an unsustainable practice in scaled-up applications,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosenbaum|first=Miriam|author2=He, Zhen |author3=Angenent, Largus T |title=Light energy to bioelectricity: photosynthetic microbial fuel cells|journal=Current Opinion in Biotechnology|date=June 2010|volume=21|issue=3|pages=259–264|doi=10.1016/j.copbio.2010.03.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; so most modern research is on mediator-free systems.

==Efficiency==
The conversion efficiency of biological photovoltaic devices is presently too low for scaled-up versions to achieve [[grid parity]].  Genetic engineering approaches are being employed to increase the current output from photosynthetic organisms for use in biological photovoltaic systems.&lt;ref name="BR13" /&gt;

'''Charcoal lighter fluid''' is a volatile [[fluid]] used to accelerate the ignition of [[charcoal]] in a [[barbecue]] grill. It can either be [[petroleum]] based (e.g., [[mineral spirits]]) or [[alcohol]] based (usually [[methanol]] or [[ethanol]]). It can be used both with lump charcoal and [[briquettes]]. Lighter-fluid infused briquettes, that eliminate the need for separate application of lighter fluid, are available. The use of lighter fluid is somewhat controversial as the substance is combustible, harmful or fatal if swallowed, and may impart an unpleasant flavor to food cooked upon fires lit with it. A traditional alternative to using lighter fluid is a [[chimney starter]].

The sale of petroleum-based charcoal lighter fluid is regulated in some jurisdictions due to its potential to cause [[photochemical smog]] through evaporation of its [[volatile organic compounds]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE4DF113FF934A35753C1A966958260 "Cleaner charcoal grilling sought in California"][[Associated Press]], ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 7, 1990. Retrieved October 29, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[South Coast Air Quality Management District]] requires that all charcoal lighter fluids sold in its jurisdiction (essentially Southern California) meet the air quality standards set forth in District Rule 1174.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=RULE 1174. CONTROL OF VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUND EMISSIONS FROM THE IGNITION OF BARBECUE CHARCOAL |url=http://www.aqmd.gov/docs/default-source/rule-book/reg-xi/rule-1174.pdf |publisher=South Coast Air Quality Management District |date=October 5, 1990 |accessdate=July 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common substitutes are [[chimney starter|chimney]] and electric fire starters.&lt;ref&gt;McGrath, Susan.

Retrieved October 29, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] countries the alcohol-based lighter fluid is sometimes consumed as a [[surrogate alcohol]] among very poor [[alcohol intoxication|alcoholics]] because of its cheap price compared to [[vodka]], just like it is with ''Troynoy'' ''[[Eau de Cologne#Drinking|Eau de Cologne]]''.&lt;ref name="süütevedelik"&gt;{{cite web|title=Surmav moejook süütevedelik|url=http://www.ohtuleht.ee/422496|publisher=[[Õhtuleht]]|accessdate=30 March 2012|language=Estonian|date=2011-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Death Star''' is the name of a number of fictional mobile [[space station]]s and galactic [[Weapon of mass destruction|superweapons]] featured in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[space opera]] franchise. The first Death Star is stated to be more than 100&amp;nbsp;km to 160&amp;nbsp;km in diameter, depending [[#Depiction|on source]]. It is crewed by an estimated 1.7 million military personnel and 400,000 droids.&lt;ref name="Star Wars: Complete Locations"&gt;Star Wars: Complete Locations&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Star Wars: Death Star Battles"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Beecroft | first1=Simon | title=Star Wars: Death Star Battles | date=2010 | publisher=Dorling Kindersley | location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; One blast of its superweapon delivers energy comparable to that  released by the Sun in an entire week.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} The second Death Star is significantly larger, between 160&amp;nbsp;km to 900&amp;nbsp;km in diameter depending [[#Depiction|on source]], and technologically more powerful than its predecessor. Both versions of these [[moon]]-sized fortresses are designed for massive [[power projection]] capabilities, capable of destroying multiple [[naval fleet]]s or entire planets with one blast from their superlasers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/culture/movies/g1638/death-star-physics-how-much-energy-does-it-take-to-blow-up-a-planet/ | title=Death Star Physics: How Much Energy Does It Take to Blow Up a Planet? | first=John | last=Brandon | publisher=PopularMechanics.com | date=October 13, 2014 | accessdate=November 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and design==
Although details, such as the superlaser's location, shifted between different concept models during production of [[Star Wars (film)|''Star Wars'']], the notion of the Death Star being a large, spherical space station over 100 kilometers in diameter was consistent in all of them.&lt;ref name="dsbts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/location/deathstar/?id=bts|title=Death Star (Behind the Scenes)|publisher=[[Lucasfilm]]|work=Star Wars Databank|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629041406/http://www.starwars.com/databank/location/deathstar/?id=bts|archivedate=June 29, 2011|accessdate=2007-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; George Lucas gave the original task of designing a "Death Star" to concept artist and spaceship modeler Colin Cantwell,&lt;ref name=cnetcantwell/&gt; who had collaborated with [[Stanley Kubrick]] on the 1968 film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.&lt;ref name=sfgate16&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2016 interview, Cantwell related that "I didn't originally plan for the Death Star to have a trench, but when I was working with the mold, I noticed the two halves had shrunk at the point where they met across the middle." As it "would have taken a week of work just to fill and sand and refill this depression," Cantwell suggested a trench to Lucas to save the labor. Lucas liked the idea,&lt;ref name=cnetcantwell&gt;{{Citation

The Death Star explosions featured in the special edition of ''A New Hope'' and in ''Return of the Jedi'' are rendered with a [[Praxis effect]], wherein a flat ring of matter erupts from the explosion.

The grid plan animations shown during the Rebel briefing for the attack on the Death Star late in ''A New Hope'' were an actual computer graphics simulation from the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] made by [[Larry Cuba]] and [[Gary Imhoff]] as part of a [[CalArts]] project, and had been included during filming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/news/death-star-plans-are-in-the-main-computer-and-special-postcard|title=The Death Star Plans ARE in the Main Computer - StarWars.com|date=11 December 2014|publisher=|accessdate=22 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death Star-class===
====DS-1 Platform - (''Star Wars'', ''Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith'', ''Rogue One'')====
The original Death Star's completed form appears in ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars: A New Hope]]'', known officially as the '''''DS-1'' Orbital Battle Station''', or '''Project Stardust''' in ''[[Rogue One]]''. Commanded by Governor Tarkin, it is the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]]'s "ultimate weapon",&lt;ref&gt;This space station is also called "Ultimate Weapon" by the original owner, the Separatist Confederacy.&lt;/ref&gt; a huge spherical space station 160 kilometers in diameter capable of destroying a planet with one shot of its superlaser. The film opens with [[Princess Leia]] transporting the station's [[schematics]] to the [[Rebel Alliance]] to aid them in destroying the Death Star. Tarkin orders the Death Star to destroy Leia's home world of [[Alderaan]] in an attempt to press her into giving him the location of the secret Rebel base; she gives them the false location of [[Dantooine]], but Tarkin has Alderaan destroyed anyway, as a demonstration of the Death Star's firepower and the Empire's resolve. Later, [[Luke Skywalker]], [[Han Solo]], [[Chewbacca]], [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], [[C-3PO]], and [[R2-D2]] are pulled aboard the station by a [[tractor beam]], where they discover and manage to rescue Princess Leia. As they make their escape, Obi-Wan dies fighting Darth Vader, enabling the others to flee the station. Later, Luke returns as part of a fighter force to attack its only weak point: a ray-shielded particle exhaust vent leading straight from the surface directly into its reactor core. Luke was able to successfully launch his fighter's torpedoes into the vent, impacting the core and triggering a catastrophic explosion, which destroyed the station before it could use its superlaser weapon to annihilate its intended target, the Rebel base on Yavin IV.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

''[[The Clone Wars]]'' Legacy story reel from the unfinished ''Crystal Crisis on Utapau'' episodes revealed that the reason [[General Grievous]] was on Utapau in ''Revenge of the Sith'' was to acquire enormous [[kyber crystal]]s, which were required to power the Death Star's superlaser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/video/star-wars-the-clone-wars-story-reel-a-death-on-utapau|title=Star Wars: The Clone Wars - Story Reel: A Death on Utapau - Star Wars: The Clone Wars|publisher=|accessdate=22 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Death Star's schematics are visible in the scenes on Geonosis in ''[[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones]]'' showcasing the early development of the Death Star prototype, the Death Star plans were designed by [[Geonosian]]s led by Archduke [[Poggle the Lesser]], a member of the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]], and is shown early in construction at the end of ''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith]]''. The Death Star plans are a central plot-point in the 2016 film ''[[Rogue One]]'' and the original 1977 film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope]]''.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

A hologram from the original Death Star is briefly visible in a scene at the Resistance base in ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens|Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens]]'' and used as a means of comparison with one from the [[First Order (Star Wars)|First Order]]'s own superweapon, Starkiller Base.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

In the animated series ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'', the two-part episode "Ghost of Geonosis" hinted that the Geonosians were nearly wiped out to extinction out of the Empire's need for secrecy. [[Saw Gerrera]], having been sent to Geonosis to investigate, deduced the Empire possesses a superweapon and resolved to discover the Death Star as depicted in the final season two-parter "In the Name of the Rebellion." Though it was a dead end, finding only scientists being abducted by the Empire, Saw learned the weapon is powered by [[kyber crystal]]s taken from the Jedha system.

The [[Star Wars#Anthology series|anthology film]] ''[[Rogue One]]'' focuses on a band of Rebels stealing the plans for the first Death Star prior to the events of ''A New Hope''. The Death Star project was overseen by Orson Krennic, the Director of Advanced Weapons Research for the Imperial Military. Under Krennic's supervision, the project was beset by constant delays, and he forcibly recruited weapons designer Galen Erso (the father of Jyn Erso, the movie's main protagonist) to complete the design; nevertheless, it was another fifteen years before the Death Star was operational. The Death Star's primary laser was powered by kyber crystals mined from the desert moon of [[Jedha]], and is first used to destroy Jedha City both as a response to a violent insurgency on the planet, and as a display of the Death Star's operational status to restore the Empire's confidence in the project. Grand Moff Tarkin assumes control over the Death Star while Krennic investigates security breaches in the design project. It is subsequently revealed that Galen discreetly sabotaged the design by building a vulnerability into the reactor. This is the same vulnerability that Luke Skywalker takes advantage of during the events of ''A New Hope''. After the Death Star plans are stolen from the Scarif vault, Tarkin fires the Death Star laser on the base killing Krennic, as well as Jyn Erso and Cassian Andor.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The canonical population of the first Death Star was 1.7 million military personnel, 400,000 maintenance droids, and 250,000 civilians/ associated contractors.&lt;ref name="Star Wars: Complete Locations"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Star Wars: Death Star Battles"/&gt;

The 2014 book ''[[Star Wars: Tarkin]]'' detailed the life of [[Grand Moff Tarkin]], and prominently featured the first Death Star. The theme of the construction of the Death Star is continued in the 2016 book, ''[[Catalyst: A Rogue One Novel]]'', which tells the story of the development of the Death Star's superweapon by the scientist, [[Galen Erso]] and Krennic's deception of him.  It also reveals how Poggle worked with Krennic on the Project but then turned on him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rogue One Prequel Book Reveals Secret Origins of the Death Star|url=http://movieweb.com/star-wars-rogue-one-prequel-novel-death-star-origins/|accessdate=21 September 2016|agency=MovieWeb.com|date=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the film ''[[Rogue One]],'' it is revealed that the Death Star's superlaser is powered by multiple reactors, allowing it to vary its destructive power depending on the target. Skeptical of the station's power, Tarkin ordered that it first be tested on Jedha City using a single reactor. Subsequently, a second single-reactor test would destroy their installation on Scarif, along with the Rebel strike force who had successfully stolen the station's plans. The destruction of the planet [[Alderaan]] would be the first time the Death Star was tested with all reactors employed.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

====DS-2 Platform - (''Return of the Jedi'')====
''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' features a second Death Star still under construction in orbit around the second moon of [[Endor (Star Wars)|Endor]]. [[Palpatine|Emperor Palpatine]] and [[Darth Vader]] send the Rebels false information that the station's weapons systems are not yet operational in order to lure them into a trap. When the station's protective shield is disabled by a ground assault team on the forest moon of the planet Endor (led by Han Solo) with the help of the native [[Ewoks]], Rebel fighters flew into the unfinished station targeting its reactor core chamber and damaged the reactor core itself, which eventually explodes and destroys the station. It was destroyed by [[Wedge Antilles]] and [[Lando Calrissian]] (with [[Nien Nunb]] as his ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'' co-pilot), the former destroying a power regulator and the latter destroying the main reactor.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

The second Death Star is featured in the cover of the book ''[[Star Wars: Aftermath]]'' (2015), which also features many flashbacks to the destruction of the second Death Star, as well as the events directly after its destruction. One of the main characters in the story personally escaped the explosion of the Death Star. The destruction of the second Death Star was also shown in holograms in the book. The 2015 comic book ''[[Star Wars: Shattered Empire]]'' also explores the days following the destruction of the second Death Star from the perspective of [[Poe Dameron]]'s parents, who were pilots during the event. The video game ''[[Star Wars: Uprising]]'' also takes place during the aftermath of the second Death Star's destruction, and features a hologram of its description on multiple occasions in and out of cutscenes.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

===Similar super weapons of mass destruction===
====Malachor Sith Temple - (''Star Wars Rebels'')====
{{main|Star Wars Rebels}}
The ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'' episode "Twilight of the Apprentice" features a forbidden planet called Malachor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/malachor|title=Malachor|publisher=|accessdate=22 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; home of an ancient [[Sith]] Temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/malachor-sith-temple|title=Malachor Sith temple|publisher=|accessdate=22 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This temple contained a superweapon capable of destroying life, and could only be activated by placing a special Sith Holocron&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/sith-holocron|title=Sith holocron|publisher=|accessdate=22 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in an [[obelisk]] at the summit of the pyramid inside the temple. Thousands of years prior, a battle was waged on Malachor that resulted in the deaths of its inhabitants. Somewhere between the events of his last appearance in ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]'' and this episode, [[Darth Maul]] had become stranded on Malachor. When [[Ahsoka Tano]], Kanan and Ezra arrived, Ezra was separated from them. He was discovered by a character who later revealed himself to be Maul. Together, they solved a series of test chambers that required cooperation between two Force wielders, and retrieved a Sith Holocron. With the help of Kanan and Ahsoka, they fought three Inquisitors, all of whom were killed by Maul. Maul then betrayed his allies, blinding Kanan, and proceeded to activate the superweapon. Once Maul was defeated by a sightless Kanan, Darth Vader arrived with the intention of retrieving the holocron, but was challenged by Ahsoka Tano, his former Padawan. While the superweapon was preparing to fire, Kanan and Ezra retrieved the holocron themselves and escaped, preventing this weapon of mass destruction from being used. Even though the temple was destabilized, Ahsoka and Vader kept fighting to the death within the rapidly-crumbling building, until it eventually exploded, wounding Darth Vader&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/31/star-wars-rebels-twilight-of-the-apprentice-review|title=Star Wars Rebels: "Twilight of the Apprentice" Review|last=Goldman|first=Eric|date=30 March 2016|publisher=|accessdate=22 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and almost killing Ahsoka, who ended up being rescued by Ezra through [[A World Between Worlds|a portal on Lothal, that he saw the battle occurring through]].

====Starkiller Base - (''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'')====
{{main|Star Wars: The Force Awakens}}
''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'' features [[Starkiller Base]], a planet converted into a superweapon built by the [[First Order (Star Wars)|First Order]]. Significantly larger than either the first or second Death Star, and unlike either of those cost-prohibitive space stations, this superweapon cut-costs by [[terraforming]] an existing planet and draws its fire power directly from a sun (by extracting a kind of [[Dark Energy]] called Quintessence and turning it into another type of dark energy called Phantom Energy), but it requires time to draw enough energy. Once fired, it has the power to destroy up to five planets within the same [[star system]] simultaneously, making it a far deadlier superweapon than the Death Star. [[General Hux]] gave an intense speech while Starkiller Base demonstrated its lethality by obliterating the five planets of the [[Hosnian Prime]] system (the location of the Republic government, which rotates every few years), the cataclysm witnessed by Han Solo, Chewbacca, Rey and Finn from [[Maz Kanata]]'s castle. After Rey was captured by [[Kylo Ren]], he interrogated her within the base. Han, Chewbacca and Finn approached the base at light-speed because the Starkiller's shield kept out anything going under the speed of light. They found Rey and successfully lowered the protective shields, enabling an X-wing assault led by [[Poe Dameron]] and Nien Numb to destroy the planet-converted superweapon, with Poe firing the crucial, destructive shots.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} The name Starkiller Base paid homage to the early drafts of the original Star Wars film, referring to Luke Skywalker's original name as Luke Starkiller.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/star-wars--a-new-hope/chewbacca-peter-mayhew-original-script/|title=The Adventures Of Luke Starkiller’: Peter Mayhew releases pages from his 1976 Star Wars script|last=Hawkes|first=Rebecca|date=February 18, 2016|website=The Daily Telegraph|access-date=February 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/3914183/star-wars-original-script/|title=Original Star Wars Script Found, Solves Long-Running Mystery|last=Locker|first=Melissa|date=June 9, 2015|website=Time|access-date=February 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death Stars in ''Star Wars Legends''===
{{main|Star Wars Legends}}

Both ''Death Star''s appear throughout the non-canonical [[Expanded Universe (Star Wars)|''Star Wars'' Legends]] (formerly known as the Expanded Universe).{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The first ''Death Star''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s construction is the subject of [[Michael Reaves]] and [[Steve Perry (author)|Steve Perry]]'s novel ''[[Death Star (novel)|Death Star]]''. In [[LucasArts]]'s ''[[Star Wars: Battlefront II (2005 video game)|Star Wars: Battlefront II]]'', the player participates in a mission to secure crystals used in the Death Star's superlaser. The first Death Star under construction acts as the final stage in the video game, ''[[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed|The Force Unleashed]]''. [[Kevin J.

[[National Public Radio]]'s [[Star Wars (radio)|''A New Hope'' adaptation]] portrays Leia (Ann Sachs) and [[Bail Organa]]'s ([[Stephen Elliott (actor)|Stephen Elliott]]) discovery of the Death Star's existence and Leia's mission to steal the space station's schematics. The first level of LucasArts' ''[[Star Wars: Dark Forces|Dark Forces]]'' gives the player a supporting role in Leia's mission, while a mission in ''Battlefront II'' tasks the player with acting as a [[Imperial stormtrooper|stormtrooper]] or Darth Vader in an attempt to recover the plans and capture Leia. [[Steve Perry (author)|Steve Perry]]'s novel ''[[Shadows of the Empire (novel)|Shadows of the Empire]]'' describes a mission that leads to the Rebels learning of the second Death Star's existence, and that mission is playable in LucasArts' ''[[X-Wing Alliance]]'' [[combat flight simulator]]. Numerous LucasArts titles recreate the movies' attacks on the Death Stars, and the Death Star itself is a controllable weapon for the Empire in the ''[[Star Wars: Rebellion (video game)|Rebellion]]'' and ''[[Star Wars: Empire at War|Empire at War]]'' strategy game. A Death Star variation appears in [[Kevin J. Anderson]]'s novel ''[[Darksaber (novel)|Darksaber]]'' (1995), and a prototype version of the Death Star can be found in his novel ''[[Jedi Search]]'' (1994).{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The first Death Star is depicted in various sources of having a crew of 265,675, as well as 52,276 gunners, 607,360 troops, 30,984 stormtroopers, 42,782 ship support staff, and 180,216 pilots and support crew.&lt;ref name="dseu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/location/deathstar/?id=eu|title=Death Star (Expanded Universe)|work=Star Wars Databank|publisher=[[Lucasfilm]]|accessdate=2007-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its hangars contain assault shuttles, blastboats, Strike cruisers, land vehicles, support ships, and 7,293 [[TIE fighter]]s.&lt;ref name="dstc"&gt;{{cite book|title=Death Star Technical Companion|publisher=[[West End Games]]|first=Bill|last=Slavicsek|date=1991-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also protected by 10,000 turbolaser batteries, 2,600 [[ion cannon]]s, and at least 768 [[tractor beam]] projectors.&lt;ref name="dstc" /&gt; Various sources state the first Death Star has a [[diameter]] of between 140 and 160 kilometers.&lt;ref name="dseu" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-57380925-1/finally-a-cost-estimate-for-building-a-real-death-star/|title=Finally, a cost estimate for building a real Death Star|last=Mack|first=Eric|date=19 February 2012|work=[[CNET]]|accessdate=5 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Incredible Cross-Sections of Star Wars, Episodes IV, V &amp; VI: The Ultimate Guide to Star Wars Vehicles and Spacecraft|first=David|last=Reynolds|isbn=0-7894-3480-6|publisher=DK Children|date=1998-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a broader range of figures for the second Death Star's diameter, ranging from 160 to 900 kilometers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/location/deathstarii/?id=eu|title=Death Star II (Expanded Universe)|publisher=[[Lucasfilm]]|work=Star Wars Databank|accessdate=2007-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Inside the Worlds of Star Wars, Episodes IV, V, &amp; VI: The Complete Guide to the Incredible Locations|publisher=DK Children|date=2004-08-16|isbn=0-7566-0307-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====DS-X Prototype Battle Station====
In the ''Legends'' novels ''Death Star'', ''Dark Empire II'', ''Jedi Search'' and ''Champions of the Force'', an experimental ''Death Star'' prototype, '''''DS-X''''' (a durasteel frame surrounding a reactor core, superlaser, engines and a control room) was conceived by [[Grand Moff Tarkin|Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin]] as a test bed for the first Death Star. It was constructed by Bevel Lemelisk and his engineers at the Empire's secret Maw Installation. The prototype measured 120 kilometers in diameter. Its superlaser was only powerful enough to destroy a planet's core, rendering it an uninhabitable "dead planet". The targeting system on the prototype was never calibrated and the superlaser was inefficient, leaving the weapon's batteries drained. The prototype had no interior except a slave-linked control room, hyperdrive engines and other components; the station operated with skeleton-crew of 75 personnel.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

George Lucas himself confirmed that the plans featured in ''Attack of the Clones'' and the under-construction facility in ''Revenge of the Sith'' was indeed the original ''Death Star''. The ''Star Wars: The New Essential Chronology'' [[retcon]]ned the ''DS-X'' prototype into being built ''alongside'' the main ''Death Star''.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

====Death Star III - (''Star Tours: The Adventures Continue'')====
In the Disney attraction ''[[Star Tours: The Adventures Continue]]'', guests can travel inside an incomplete Death Star during one of the randomized ride sequences. In the original Star Tours, a '''''Death Star III''''' is seen and destroyed during the ride sequence by the New Republic. [[Leland Chee]] originally created the third ''Death Star'' to explain why a ''Death Star'' is present on the ''[[Star Tours]]'' ride when both of the stations in the movies were destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/news/convenient-daily-departures-the-history-of-star-tours|title=Convenient Daily Departures: The History of Star Tours - StarWars.com|date=22 August 2013|publisher=|accessdate=22 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The station being built near the Forest Moon of Endor like the second ''Death Star'' before it is similar to an original concept for Return of the Jedi, where two ''Death Star''s would have been built near Had Abbadon (then the Imperial capital world). The ''Habitation'' spheres, based on the Imperials' suspicious claims that they were designed strictly for peaceful purposes, were suggested by some fans to have been the origin for the Death Star III. This was later revealed to be the case in Part 2 of the StarWars.com Blog series ''The Imperial Warlords: Despoilers of an Empire''. In the ''[[Star Wars Legends]]'' game ''[[Tiny Death Star]]'', a random HoloNet entry states that one of the residents of the ''Death Star'' is simply staying there until he can afford to stay at the third ''Death Star''.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===Petitions===
====White House petition====
In 2012–13, a proposal on the [[White House]]'s website urging the United States government to build a real Death Star as an economic stimulus and job creation measure gained more than 30,000 signatures, enough to qualify for an official response. The official ([[tongue-in-cheek]]) response was released in January 2013:&lt;ref name="Wired-20130111"&gt;{{cite news |last=Shawcross |first=Paul |title=This Isn't the Petition Response You're Looking For |url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2013/01/white-house-death-star/ |date=January 11, 2013 |publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |accessdate=January 13, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the cost of building a real Death Star has been estimated at $850 quadrillion by the [[Lehigh University]], or about 13,000 times the amount of mineable resources on [[Earth]], while the ''[[International Business Times]]'' cited a Centives economics blog calculation that, at current rates of steel production, the Death Star would not be ready for more than 833,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/white-house-rejects-death-star-petition-doomsday-devices-us-could-build-instead-1014682|title=White House Rejects Death Star Petition: Doomsday Devices US Could Build Instead|author=Roxanne Palmer|date=15 January 2013|work=International Business Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The White House response also stated "the Administration does not support blowing up planets," and questioned funding a weapon "with a fundamental flaw that can be exploited by a one-man starship" as reasons for denying the petition.&lt;ref name="Wired-20130111" /&gt;&lt;ref name="deathstar"&gt;{{cite web|title=It's a trap!

==== Petition in other countries ====
The Luxemburgish magician Christian Lavey (born as Christian Kies) submitted a petition for the construction of a Death Star to the Luxemburgish parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://luxtimes.lu/community/32573-petition-for-luxembourg-to-join-dark-side-build-death-star|title=Luxembourg Times - Community - Petition for Luxembourg to join dark side, build Death Star|website=luxtimes.lu|language=en|access-date=2018-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on an interview with a local radio station Lavey admitted that this petition was just a joke and some kind of protest against the space plans of the government.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2002">In [[telecommunication]], [[electronics]] and the [[electrical power industry]], the term '''demand factor''' is used to refer to the fractional amount of some quantity being used relative to the maximum amount that could be used by the same system. The demand factor is always less than or equal to one. As the amount of demand is a time dependent quantity so is the demand factor.

&lt;math&gt; f_{Demand}(\it{t}) = \frac{\text{Demand}}{\text{Maximum possible demand}}&lt;/math&gt;

The demand factor is often implicitly averaged over time when the time period of demand is understood by the context.

== Electrical engineering ==

In [[electrical engineering]] the demand factor is taken as a time independent quantity where the numerator is taken as the maximum demand in the specified time period instead of the averaged or instantaneous demand.

&lt;math&gt; f_{Demand} = \frac{ \text{Maximum load in given time period}}{\text{Maximum possible load}}&lt;/math&gt;

This is the peak in the [[load profile]] divided by the full load of the device.

Example: 
If a residence has equipment which could draw 6,000 W when all equipment was drawing a full load, drew a maximum of 3,000 W in a specified time, then the demand factor = 3,000 W / 6,000 W = 0.5


This quantity is relevant when trying to establish the amount of load for which a system should be rated. In the above example, it would be unlikely that the system would be rated to 6,000 W, even though there may be a slight possibility that this amount of power can be drawn. This is closely related to the [[load factor (electrical)|load factor]] which is the average load divided by the peak load in a specified time period.

&lt;math&gt; f_{Load} = \frac{\text{Average load}}{ \text{Maximum load in given time period}}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Diffusion Current ''' is a [[electric current|current]] in a [[semiconductor]] caused by the [[diffusion]] of charge carriers (holes and/or electrons). This is the current which is due to the transport of charges occurring because of non-uniform concentration of charged particles in a semiconductor.  The [[drift current]], by contrast, is due to the motion of charge carriers due to the force exerted on them by an electric field.  Diffusion current can be in the same or opposite direction of a drift current. The diffusion current and drift current together are described by the [[drift–diffusion equation]].&lt;ref&gt;McGraw Hill Encyclopaedia of Physics (2nd Edition), C.B. Parker, 1994, {{ISBN|0-07-051400-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is necessary to consider the part of diffusion current when describing many semiconductor devices.  For example, the current near the [[depletion region]] of a [[p–n junction]] is dominated by the diffusion current.  Inside the depletion region, both diffusion current and drift current are present.  At equilibrium in a p–n junction, the forward diffusion current in the depletion region is balanced with a reverse drift current, so that the net current is zero.

The [[diffusion constant]] for a doped material can be determined with the [[Haynes–Shockley experiment]].  Alternatively, if the carrier mobility is known, the diffusion coefficient may be determined from the [[Einstein relation (kinetic theory)|Einstein relation on electrical mobility]].

==Overview==

===Diffusion current versus drift current===
{{further|Drift current}}
The following table compares the two types of current:

:{| class="wikitable"
|-
! scope="col" width="450px" | Diffusion current
! scope="col" width="450px" | Drift current
|-
| Diffusion current movement caused by variation in the carrier concentration.
| Drift current movement caused by electric fields.
|-
| Direction of the diffusion current depends on the slope of the carrier concentration.
| Direction of the drift current is always in the direction of the electric field.
|-
| Obeys [[Fick's law]]: &lt;math&gt;J = -qD \frac{d \rho}{d x} &lt;/math&gt;
| Obeys [[Ohm's law]]: &lt;math&gt;J=q\rho\mu E&lt;/math&gt;
|}

===Carrier actions===
No external electric field across the semiconductor is required for a diffusion current to take place. This is because diffusion takes place due to the change in concentration of the carrier particles and not the concentrations themselves. The carrier particles, namely the holes and electrons of a semiconductor, move from a place of higher concentration to a place of lower concentration. Hence, due to the flow of holes and electrons there is a current. This current is called the diffusion current. The drift current and the diffusion current make up the total current in the conductor. The change in the concentration of the carrier particles develops a gradient. Due to this gradient, an electric field is produced in the semiconductor.

==Derivation==

{{formula missing descriptions|date=June 2012}}

To derive the diffusion current in a semiconductor diode, the depletion layer must be large compared to the mean free path.
One begins with the equation for the net [[current density]] ''J'' in a semiconductor diode,
 
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
J = q n \mu E + q D\frac{dn}{dx}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

where ''D'' is the [[diffusion coefficient]] for the electron in the considered medium, ''n'' is the number of electrons per unit volume (i.e. number density), ''q'' is the magnitude of charge of an electron, ''μ'' is electron mobility in the medium, and ''E'' = −''d''Φ/''dx'' (Φ potential difference) is the [[electric field]] as the [[potential gradient]] of the [[electric potential]]. According to the [[Einstein relation (kinetic theory)|Einstein relation on electrical mobility]] &lt;math&gt;D = \mu V_t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_t = k T / q&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, substituting ''E'' for the potential gradient in the above equation ({{EquationNote|1}}) and multiplying both sides with exp(−Φ/V&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;), ({{EquationNote|1}}) becomes:
 
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
J e^{-\Phi / V_t} = q D\left(\frac{-n}{V_t}*\frac{d\Phi}{dx} + \frac{dn}{dx}\right)e^{-\Phi / V_t} = q D  \frac{d}{dx}(n e^{-\Phi / V_t})
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

Integrating equation ({{EquationNote|2}}) over the depletion region gives

:&lt;math&gt;J = \frac{q D n e^{-\Phi / V_t}\big|_0^{x_d}}{\int_0^{x_d} e^{-\Phi / V_t}dx}&lt;/math&gt;

which can be written as

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
J = \frac{ q D N_c e^{-\Phi_B/ V_t}\left[e^{V_a/ V_t} - 1\right]}{\int_0^{x_d} e^{-\Phi^*/ V_t} dx}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

where 
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi^* = \Phi_B + \Phi_i - V_a&lt;/math&gt;

The denominator in equation ({{EquationNote|3}}) can be solved by using the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi = - \frac{q N_d}{2E_s (x - x_d)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, Φ* can be written as:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\Phi^* = \frac{q N_d x}{E_s} \left(x_d - \frac{x}{2}\right) = (\Phi_i - V_a)\frac{x}{x_d}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4}}}}

Since the ''x'' &lt;&lt; ''x&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;'' the term (''x&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;'' − ''x''/2) ≈ ''x&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;'', using this approximation equation ({{EquationNote|3}}) is solved as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^{x_d} e^{-\Phi^* / V_t}dx = x_d \frac{\Phi_i - V_a}{V_t}&lt;/math&gt;,

since (Φ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; − ''V&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'') &gt; ''V&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''. One obtains the equation of current caused due to diffusion:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
J = \frac{q_2 D N_c}{V_t} \left[\frac{2q}{E_s}( \Phi_i - V_a) N_d\right]^{1/2} e^{-\Phi_B / V_t}(e^{V_a / V_t} - 1)
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|5}}}}

From equation ({{EquationNote|5}}), one can observe that the current depends exponentially on the input voltage ''V&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'', also the barrier height Φ&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;. From equation ({{EquationNote|5}}), ''V&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' can be written as the function of electric field intensity, which is as follows:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
E_\mathrm{max} = \left[\frac{2q}{E_s} (\Phi_i - V_a) N_d\right]^{1/2}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|6}}}}

Substituting equation ({{EquationNote|6}}) in equation ({{EquationNote|5}}) gives:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
J = q \mu E_\mathrm{max} N_c e^{-\Phi_B  / V_t}(e^{V_a/V_t} - 1)
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|7}}}}

From equation ({{EquationNote|7}}), one can observe that when a zero voltage is applied to the semi-conductor diode, the drift current totally balances the diffusion current. Hence, the net current in a semiconductor diode at zero potential is always zero.

[[File:diffusion_center.gif|thumb|350px|right|As carriers are generated (green:electrons and purple:holes) due to light shining at the center of an intrinsic semiconductor, they diffuse towards two ends. Electrons have higher diffusion constant than holes leading to fewer excess electrons at the center as compared to holes.]]

==Example==
The equation above can be applied to model semiconductor devices. When the density of electrons is not in equilibrium, diffusion of electrons will occur. For example, when a bias is applied to two ends of a chunk of semiconductor, or a light is shining in one place (see right figure), electron will diffuse from high density regions (center) to low density regions (two ends), forming a gradient of electron density. This process generates diffusion current.

'''Difluoroamino sulfur pentafluoride''' is a gaseous chemical compound of fluorine, sulfur, and nitrogen.  It is unusual in having a hexa-coordinated sulfur atom with a link to nitrogen. Other names for this substance include '''difluoro(pentafluorosulfur)amine''', '''pentafluorosulfanyldifluoramine''', and '''pentafluorosulfanyl ''N'',''N''-difluoramine'''.

==Properties==
Difluoroamino sulfur pentafluoride is a colourless gas at room temperature.&lt;ref name=logo63/&gt; The molecule is shaped as a tetragonal bipyramid around the sulfur atom.&lt;ref name=logo63/&gt;

To within half a degree the boiling point is -17.5&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=logo63&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Logothetis|first1=A. L.|last2=Sausen|first2=G. N.|last3=Shozda|first3=R. J.|title=The Preparation of Difluoroamino Sulfur Pentafluoride|journal=Inorganic Chemistry|date=February 1963|volume=2|issue=1|pages=173–175|doi=10.1021/ic50005a044}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Difluoroamino sulfur pentafluoride is stable at room temperature, but decomposes on the timescale of hours at 80&amp;nbsp;°C. Decomposition results in [[sulfur tetrafluoride]] and [[nitrogen trifluoride]].&lt;ref name=logo63/&gt; It is not stable above 220&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=JaneMac/&gt; It is stable with water or stainless steel.&lt;ref name=JaneMac&gt;{{cite book|last1=Macintyre|first1=Jane E.|title=Dictionary of Inorganic Compounds|date=23 July 1992|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9780412301209|page=3240|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9eJvoNCSCRMC&amp;pg=PA3240|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When stored in quartz and exposed to ultraviolet light, it decomposes slightly and reacts with silica to make SF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, NF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, SOF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.&lt;ref name=logo63/&gt;

The bond between sulfur and nitrogen is quite weak with a dissociation energy of 50&amp;nbsp;kcal/mol.&lt;ref name=Lyman79/&gt;

The infrared spectrum contains strong absorption bands around 885, 910, and 950&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; due to the bonds with fluorine. If a strong irradiation at 910&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; with a laser takes place the molecules can be disrupted to form [[disulfur decafluoride]], SF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. By adjusting the frequency of a laser, the break up can be made isotope selective., and also the S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; can be broken up by another nearby frequency.&lt;ref name=Lyman79&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lyman|first1=John L.|last2=Danen|first2=Wayne C.|last3=Nilsson|first3=Alan C.|last4=Nowak|first4=Andrew V.|title=Multiple-photon excitation of difluoroamino sulfur pentafluoride: A study of absorption and dissociation|journal=The Journal of Chemical Physics|date=1979|volume=71|issue=3|pages=1206|doi=10.1063/1.438466|bibcode=1979JChPh..71.1206L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fluorine atoms attached to the sulfur are attached at close to 90° from each other, and the four around the equator are also at 90° from the nitrogen sulfur bond. The angle subtended by fluorine atoms on the nitrogen atom is about 98°, and the sulfur-nitrogen-fluorine angle is about 111°. The distance between sulfur and the four equatorial fluorine atoms is 1.545&amp;nbsp;Å. The axial fluorine to sulfur distance is 1.556&amp;nbsp;Å. Nitrogen sulfur distance is about 1.696&amp;nbsp;Å. The fluorine-nitrogen bond is the shortest in the molecule at 1.378&amp;nbsp;Å.&lt;ref name=Haase71&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haase|first1=J.|last2=Oberhammer|first2=H.|last3=Zentrum|first3=W.

==Preparation==
Difluoroamino sulfur pentafluoride has been prepared by irradiating a mixture of [[dinitrogen tetrafluoride]] and [[sulfur tetrafluoride]] with ultraviolet light.

:N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 SF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 SF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;NF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=logo63/&gt;

This preparation also works with a mixture of dinitrogen tetrafluoride and [[sulfur chloride pentafluoride]]. Formation requires the appearance of the SF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; radical and chlorine atoms, as well as the [[nitrogen difluoride]] radical.&lt;ref name=logo63/&gt;

Another way to make difluoroamino sulfur pentafluoride is by heating dinitrogen tetrafluoride and sulfur. This results in the temporary formation of [[nitrogen difluoride]].  However the yield is only around 6%, and mostly sulfur tetrafluoride is formed.&lt;ref name=logo63/&gt;
Yet other substrates for dinitrogen tetrafluoride are [[disulfur decafluoride]] or [[sulfur dioxide]] or [[thiophosgene]] in an electric discharge.&lt;ref name=Stump&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stump|first1=Eugene C.|last2=Padgett|first2=Calvin D.|last3=Brey|first3=Wallace S.|title=The Synthesis of Difluoraminosulfur Pentafluoride|journal=Inorganic Chemistry|date=17 November 1962|volume=2|issue=3|pages=648–649|doi=10.1021/ic50007a062|language=EN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A corona discharge in a [[sulfur hexafluoride]], [[nitrogen]] mixture produces a small amount of difluoroamino sulfur pentafluoride. THis is important as high voltage equipment is often insulated with this gas combination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Casanovas|first1=Anne-Marie|last2=Vial|first2=Lawrence|last3=Coll|first3=Isabelle|last4=Storer|first4=Magali|last5=Casanovas|first5=Joseph|last6=Clavreul|first6=Regine|editor1-last=Christophorou|editor1-first=Loucas G.|editor2-last=Olthoff|editor2-first=James K.|title=Gaseous Dielectrics VIII|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781461548997|pages=379–383|chapter=Decomposition of SF6 under AC and DC Corona Discharges in High-Pressure SF6 and SF6/N2 (10%-90%) Mixtures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9DjSBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA379|accessdate=23 December 2015|language=en|date=2012-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pentafluorosulfanylamine reacts with fluorine gas to yield difluoroamino sulfur pentafluoride:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Verma|first1=R. D.|last2=Kirchmeier|first2=Robert L.|last3=Shreeve|first3=Jean'ne M.|title=Advances in Inorganic Chemistry|volume=41|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=9780080578903|pages=144|chapter=Chemistry of Pentafluorosulfanyl Compounds|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ra96A-2jswC&amp;pg=PA144|language=en|date=1994-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:SF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → SF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;NF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 HF

==Reactions==
Difluoroamino sulfur pentafluoride reacts with Lewis acids like KrF&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;AsF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; at -31°C to yield SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, Kr, NF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and solid N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;AsF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;. With AsF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; at -196°C (as liquid) it produces solid N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;AsF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and trans-N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Similar products also come from room temperature reactions.&lt;ref name=Christe85&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Christe|first1=Karl O.|last2=Wilson|first2=William W.|last3=Schack|first3=Carl J.|last4=Wilson|first4=Richard D.|title=Lewis acid induced intramolecular redox reactions of difluoroamino compounds|journal=Inorganic Chemistry|date=January 1985|volume=24|issue=3|pages=303–307|doi=10.1021/ic00197a013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A tertiary amine exists with formula (SF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N.

Other variant substitutions on the nitrogen atom yield SF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;NFCl, SF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;NHF, SF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;NCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and SF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[File:Steve Papell NASA ferrofluid developer in 1963.JPG|thumb|Steve Papell invented ferrofluid for NASA in 1963]]
A '''ferrofluid''' ([[portmanteau]] of [[ferromagnetic]] and [[fluid]]) is a liquid that becomes strongly magnetized in the presence of a [[magnetic field]].
A grinding process for ferrofluid was invented in 1963 by NASA's Steve Papell as a liquid rocket fuel that could be drawn toward a pump inlet in a weightless environment by applying a magnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;US Patent # 3215572 filed Oct 9, 1963 https://www.google.com/patents/US3215572&lt;/ref&gt; The name ferrofluid was introduced, the process improved, more highly magnetic liquids synthesized, additional carrier liquids discovered, and the physical chemistry elucidated by R. E. Rosensweig and colleagues; in addition Rosensweig evolved a new branch of fluid mechanics termed ferrohydrodynamics.&lt;ref&gt;Rosensweig, R.E., Ferrohydrodynamics, Cambridge University Press, New York(1985), now available in reprint as a Dover Publication, Mineola, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferrofluids are [[colloidal]] liquids made of [[nanoscale]] [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]], or [[Ferrimagnetic interaction|ferrimagnetic]], particles suspended in a [[Wiktionary:carrier|carrier]] [[fluid]] (usually an [[organic solvent]] or water).  Each tiny particle is thoroughly coated with a [[surfactant]] to inhibit clumping.  Large ferromagnetic particles can be ripped out of the homogeneous colloidal mixture, forming a separate clump of magnetic dust when exposed to strong magnetic fields. The magnetic attraction of [[nanoparticle]]s is weak enough that the surfactant's [[Van der Waals force]] is sufficient to prevent magnetic clumping or [[Flocculation|agglomeration]].  Ferrofluids usually do not retain [[magnetization]] in the absence of an externally applied field and thus are often classified as "superparamagnets" rather than ferromagnets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Voit|first1=W.|last2=Kim|first2=D. K.|last3=Zapka|first3=W.|last4=Muhammed|first4=M.|last5=Rao|first5=K. V.|title=Magnetic behavior of coated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles in ferrofluids|journal=MRS Proceedings|date=21 March 2011|volume=676|doi=10.1557/PROC-676-Y7.8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The difference between ferrofluids and [[magnetorheological fluid]]s (MR fluids) is the size of the particles. The particles in a ferrofluid primarily consist of nanoparticles which are [[suspension (chemistry)|suspended]] by [[Brownian motion]] and generally will not settle under normal conditions. MR fluid particles primarily consist of micrometre-scale particles which are too heavy for Brownian motion to keep them suspended, and thus will settle over time because of the inherent density difference between the particle and its carrier fluid. These two fluids have very different applications as a result.

==Description==
[[File:R. E. Rosensweig with ferrofluid in his lab (1965).jpg|thumb|R. E. Rosensweig with ferrofluid in his lab (1965)]]

Ferrofluids are composed of nanoscale particles (diameter usually 10 nanometers or less) of  [[magnetite]], [[hematite]] or some other compound containing [[iron]], and a liquid. This is small enough for thermal agitation to disperse them evenly within a carrier fluid, and for them to contribute to the overall magnetic response of the fluid. This is similar to the way that the ions in an aqueous [[paramagnetic]] salt solution (such as an aqueous solution of [[copper(II) sulfate]] or [[manganese(II) chloride]]) make the solution paramagnetic. The composition of a typical ferrofluid is about 5% magnetic solids, 10% [[surfactant]] and 85% carrier, by volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://chemistry.about.com/od/demonstrationsexperiments/ss/liquidmagnet.htm|title=How to Make Liquid Magnets|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-07-09|last=Helmenstine |first=Anne Marie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Particles in ferrofluids are dispersed in a liquid, often using a [[surfactant]], and thus ferrofluids are [[Colloid|colloidal suspensions]] – materials with properties of more than one state of matter. In this case, the two states of matter are the solid metal and liquid it is in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://education.jlab.org/beamsactivity/6thgrade/vocabulary/index.html|title=Vocabulary List|website=education.jlab.org|language=en-us|access-date=2018-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ability to change phases with the application of a magnetic field allows them to be used as [[seal (mechanical)|seals]], [[lubricant]]s, and may open up further applications in future [[nanoelectromechanical systems]].

True ferrofluids are stable. This means that the solid particles do not agglomerate or phase separate even in extremely strong magnetic fields. However, the surfactant tends to break down over time (a few years), and eventually the nano-particles will agglomerate, and they will separate out and no longer contribute to the fluid's magnetic response.

The term [[magnetorheological fluid]] (MRF) refers to liquids similar to ferrofluids (FF) that solidify in the presence of a magnetic field.  Magnetorheological fluids have [[micrometre]] scale magnetic particles that are one to three orders of magnitude larger than those of ferrofluids.

However, ferrofluids lose their magnetic properties at sufficiently high temperatures, known as the [[Curie temperature]].

===Normal-field instability===
[[File:Ferrofluid poles.jpg|thumb|right|Ferrofluid is the oily substance collecting at the poles of the magnet which is underneath the white dish.]]

When a paramagnetic fluid is subjected to a strong vertical [[magnetic field]], the surface forms a regular pattern of peaks and valleys. This effect is known as the ''Rosensweig'' or ''normal-field instability''. The instability is driven by the magnetic field; it can be explained by considering which shape of the fluid minimizes the total energy of the system.{{sfn|Andelman|Rosensweig|2009|pp= 20–21}}

From the point of view of [[magnetic energy]], peaks and valleys are energetically favorable. In the corrugated configuration, the magnetic field is concentrated in the peaks; since the fluid is more easily magnetized than the air, this lowers the magnetic energy. In consequence the spikes of fluid ride the field lines out into space until there is a balance of the forces involved.{{sfn|Andelman|Rosensweig|2009|pp= 21, 23; Fig. 11}}

At the same time the formation of peaks and valleys is resisted by [[gravity]] and [[surface tension]]. It requires energy both to move fluid out of the valleys and up into the spikes, and to increase the surface area of the fluid. In summary, the formation of the corrugations increases the [[specific surface energy|surface free energy]] and the [[gravitational energy]] of the liquid, but reduces the magnetic energy. The corrugations will only form above a critical magnetic [[field strength]], when the reduction in magnetic energy outweighs the increase in surface and gravitation energy terms.{{sfn|Andelman|Rosensweig|2009|pp= 21}}

Ferrofluids have an exceptionally high [[magnetic susceptibility]] and the critical magnetic field for the onset of the corrugations can be realised by a small bar magnet.

[[File:Ferrofluid close.jpg|thumb|[[Macrophotograph]] of ferrofluid influenced by a magnet.]]

===Common ferrofluid surfactants===
The [[surfactant]]s used to coat the nanoparticles include, but are not limited to:

* [[oleic acid]]
* [[tetramethylammonium hydroxide]]
* [[citric acid]]
* [[soy lecithin]]

These [[surfactant]]s prevent the nanoparticles from clumping together, ensuring that the particles do not form aggregates that become too heavy to be held in suspension by [[Brownian motion]]. The magnetic particles in an ideal ferrofluid do not settle out, even when exposed to a strong magnetic, or gravitational field. A surfactant has a [[chemical polarity|polar]] head and non-polar tail (or vice versa), one of which [[adsorption|adsorbs]] to a nanoparticle, while the non-polar tail (or polar head) sticks out into the carrier medium, forming an inverse or regular [[micelle]], respectively, around the particle. Electrostatic repulsion then prevents agglomeration of the particles.

While surfactants are useful in prolonging the settling rate in ferrofluids, they also prove detrimental to the fluid's magnetic properties (specifically, the fluid's [[magnetic saturation]]). The addition of surfactants (or any other foreign particles) decreases the [[packing density]] of the ferroparticles while in its activated state, thus decreasing the fluid's on-state [[viscosity]], resulting in a "softer" activated fluid. While the on-state viscosity (the "hardness" of the activated fluid) is less of a concern for some ferrofluid applications, it is a primary fluid property for the majority of their commercial and industrial applications and therefore a compromise must be met when considering on-state viscosity versus the settling rate of a ferrofluid.

==Applications==
===Actual===
====Electronic devices====
{{main|Ferrofluidic seal}}
Ferrofluids are used to form liquid [[Seal (mechanical)|seals]] around the spinning drive shafts in [[hard disk]]s.  The rotating shaft is surrounded by magnets. A small amount of ferrofluid, placed in the gap between the magnet and the shaft, will be held in place by its attraction
to the magnet. The fluid of magnetic particles forms a barrier which prevents debris from entering the interior of the hard drive. According to engineers at Ferrotec, ferrofluid seals on rotating shafts typically withstand 3 to 4 psi;{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} additional seals can be stacked to form assemblies capable of withstanding higher pressures.

====Mechanical engineering====
Ferrofluids have [[friction]]-reducing capabilities. If applied to the surface of a strong enough magnet, such as one made of [[neodymium]], it can cause the magnet to glide across smooth surfaces with minimal resistance.

Ferrofluids can also be used in semi-active dampers in mechanical and aerospace applications. While passive dampers are generally bulkier and designed for a particular vibration source in mind, active dampers consume more power. Ferrofluid based dampers solve both of these issues and are becoming popular in the helicopter community, which has to deal with large inertial and aerodynamic vibrations.

==== Materials science research ====
Ferrofluids can be used to image magnetic domain structures on the surface of ferromagnetic materials using a technique developed by [[Francis Bitter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mee|first=C D|date=1950-08-01|title=The Mechanism of Colloid Agglomeration in the Formation of Bitter Patterns|url=http://stacks.iop.org/0370-1298/63/i=8/a=122?key=crossref.d5dd5c87e293fe8b0c3b380fdec6d174|journal=Proceedings of the Physical Society. Section A|volume=63|issue=8|pages=922|doi=10.1088/0370-1298/63/8/122|issn=0370-1298|bibcode=1950PPSA...63..922M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Loudspeakers====
Ferrofluids are commonly used in [[loudspeaker]]s to remove heat from the [[voice coil]], and to passively [[damping|damp]] the movement of the cone. They reside in what would normally be the air gap around the voice coil, held in place by the speaker's magnet. Since ferrofluids are paramagnetic, they obey [[Curie's law]] and thus become less magnetic at higher temperatures. A strong magnet placed near the voice coil (which produces heat) will attract cold ferrofluid more than hot ferrofluid thus forcing the heated ferrofluid away from the electric voice coil and toward a [[heat sink]]. This is a relatively efficient cooling method which requires no additional energy input.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Rlums, Elmars|url=http://www.sbfisica.org.br/bjp/download/v25/v25a10.pdf|journal=Brazilian Journal of Physics|volume=25|issue=2|date=1995|title=New Applications of Heat and Mass Transfer Processes in Temperature Sensitive Magnetic Fluids}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Former===
====Medical applications====
Several ferrofluids were marketed for use as [[MRI contrast agent|contrast agents]] in [[magnetic resonance imaging]], which depend on the difference in magnetic relaxation times of different tissues to provide contrast.&lt;ref name=app/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=YX|title=Superparamagnetic iron oxide based MRI contrast agents: Current status of clinical application|journal=Quantitative Imaging in Medicine and Surgery|date=December 2011|volume=1|issue=1|pages=35–40|pmid=23256052|pmc=3496483|doi=10.3978/j.issn.2223-4292.2011.08.03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several agents were introduced and then withdrawn from the market, including Feridex I.V.

===Proposed===
====[[Spacecraft propulsion]]====
Ferrofluids can be made to self-assemble nanometer-scale needle-like sharp tips under the influence of a magnetic field. When they reach a critical thinness, the needles begin emitting jets that might be used in the future as a thruster mechanism to propel small satellites such as [[CubeSat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.spacesafetymagazine.com/2013/10/17/novel-thrusters-developed-nanosats|title=Novel Thrusters Being Developed for Nanosats|date=2013-10-17|work=Space Safety Magazine|access-date=2018-07-09|language=en-US|last=Raval |first=Siddharth }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Analytical instrumentation====
Ferrofluids have numerous [[optical]] applications because of their [[refractive]] properties; that is, each grain, a [[magnet|micromagnet]], reflects light. These applications include measuring [[specific viscosity]] of a liquid placed between a [[polarizer]] and an [[analyzer]], illuminated by a [[helium–neon laser]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.proeng.2013.09.250|title=Transient Optical Phenomenon in Ferrofluids|journal=Procedia Engineering|volume=76|pages=74–79|year=2014|last1=Pai|first1=Chintamani|last2=Shalini|first2=M|last3=Radha|first3=S|bibcode=2017ProEn.204...69B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Medical applications====
Ferrofluids have been proposed for magnetic drug targeting. In this process the drugs would be attached to or enclosed within a ferrofluid and could be targeted and selectively released using magnetic fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kumar|first1=CS|last2=Mohammad|first2=F|title=Magnetic nanomaterials for hyperthermia-based therapy and controlled drug delivery|journal=Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews|date=14 August 2011|volume=63|issue=9|pages=789–808|pmid=21447363|pmc=3138885|doi=10.1016/j.addr.2011.03.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been proposed for targeted [[magnetic hyperthermia]] to convert electromagnetic energy into heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kafrouni|first1=L|last2=Savadogo|first2=O|title=Recent progress on magnetic nanoparticles for magnetic hyperthermia|journal=Progress in Biomaterials|date=December 2016|volume=5|issue=3–4|pages=147–160|doi=10.1007/s40204-016-0054-6|pmid=27995583|pmc=5304434}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been proposed in a form of nanosurgery to separate one tissue from another—for example a tumor from the tissue in which it has grown.&lt;ref name=app&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Scherer, C.  |author2=Figueiredo Neto, A. M. |title=Ferrofluids: Properties and Applications|journal= Brazilian Journal of Physics|volume=35|issue=3A|pages=718–727|date=2005|url=http://www.sbfisica.org.br/bjp/files/v35_718.pdf|doi=10.1590/S0103-97332005000400018|bibcode = 2005BrJPh..35..718S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Heat transfer====
An external magnetic field imposed on a ferrofluid with varying susceptibility (e.g., because of a temperature gradient) results in a nonuniform magnetic body force, which leads to a form of [[heat transfer]] called [[thermomagnetic convection]].  This form of heat transfer can be useful when conventional convection heat transfer is inadequate; e.g., in miniature microscale devices or under [[microgravity|reduced gravity]] conditions.

Ferrofluids of suitable composition can exhibit extremely large enhancement in thermal conductivity (k; ~300% of the base fluid thermal conductivity). The large enhancement in k is due to the efficient transport of heat through percolating nanoparticle paths. Special magnetic nanofluids with tunable thermal conductivity to viscosity ratio can be used as multifunctional ‘smart materials’ that can remove heat and also arrest vibrations (damper). Such fluids may find applications in microfluidic devices and microelectromechanical systems ([[MEMS]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/jp204827q |title=Tuning of Thermal Conductivity and Rheology of Nanofluids Using an External Stimulus|date=2011|last1=Shima|first1=P. D.|last2=Philip|first2=John|journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry C|volume=115|issue=41|page=20097}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Optics====
Research is under way to create an [[Ferrofluid mirror|adaptive optics shape-shifting magnetic mirror]] from ferrofluid for Earth-based astronomical [[Optical telescope|telescope]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=New Scientist|title=Morphing mirror could clear the skies for astronomers|date=7 November 2008|author=Hecht, Jeff |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn15154-morphing-mirror-could-clear-the-skies-for-astronomers.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Optical filters are used to select different wavelengths of light. The replacement of filters is cumbersome, especially when the wavelength is changed continuously with tunable-type lasers. Optical filters tunable for different wavelengths by varying the magnetic field can be built using ferrofluid emulsion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1088/0957-0233/14/8/314|title=A tunable optical filter|date=2003|last1=Philip|first1=John|last2=Jaykumar|first2=T|last3=Kalyanasundaram|first3=P|last4=Raj|first4=Baldev|journal=Measurement Science and Technology|volume=14|issue=8|page=1289|bibcode = 2003MeScT..14.1289P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Energy harvesting====
Ferrofluids enable an interesting opportunity to harvest vibration energy from the environment. Existing methods of harvesting low frequency (&lt;100&amp;nbsp;Hz) vibrations require the use of solid resonant structures. With ferrofluids, energy harvester designs no longer need solid structure. One simple example of ferrofluid based energy harvesting is to place the ferrofluid inside a container to use external mechanical vibrations to generate electricity inside a coil wrapped around the container surrounded by a permanent magnet.&lt;ref name="Bibo2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bibo|first1=A.|last2=Masana|first2=R.|last3=King|first3=A.|last4=Li|first4=G.|last5=Daqaq|first5=M.F.|title=Electromagnetic ferrofluid-based energy harvester|journal=Physics Letters A|date=June 2012|volume=376|issue=32|pages=2163–2166|doi=10.1016/j.physleta.2012.05.033|bibcode=2012PhLA..376.2163B}}&lt;/ref&gt; First a ferrofluid is placed inside a container that is wrapped with a coil of wire. The ferrofluid is then externally magnetized using a permanent magnet. When external vibrations cause the ferrofluid to slosh around in the container, there is a change in magnetic flux fields with respect to the coil of wire. Through [[Faraday's Law of Induction|Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction]], voltage is induced in the coil of wire due to change in magnetic flux.&lt;ref name="Bibo2012"/&gt;

'''''Flowing Gold''''' is a 1940 American [[adventure film]] starring [[John Garfield]], [[Frances Farmer]], and [[Pat O'Brien (actor)|Pat O'Brien]]. It was based on the novel of the same name by [[Rex Beach]]. The film is set in the American oilfields and the title refers to oil.

==Plot==
Oilfield worker John Alexander (John Garfield) is on the run from a murder charge. He talks "Hap" O'Connor (Pat O'Brien) into hiring "Johnny Blake" on a trial basis, even though Hap has been contacted by the police and given a [[wanted poster]] with a photograph of the fugitive. Hap is rewarded when Johnny saves him from being attacked by a man Hap fires for being drunk on the job. However, when the police show up again, Johnny has to flee.

Hap and his crew travel to a new oil field to dig a well for old friend Ellery Q. "Wildcat" Chalmers ([[Raymond Walburn]]). Hap is pleasantly surprised to discover that Wildcat's daughter Linda (Frances Farmer) has grown up into a very attractive woman. However, Charles Hammond ([[Granville Bates]]), Wildcat's longtime bitter enemy, sees to it that his loan request is turned down by the bank. Wildcat has no more money, but Hap offers his life savings and is made a partner.

When they haul their equipment to the site Wildcat has leased, they find their way blocked by a fence put up by Hammond's men.  They drive through it, and a wild melee breaks out. In the middle of it, Hap and Johnny find themselves at each other's throat. Johnny quickly switches sides, and Hammond's men are sent packing.

Johnny goes to work for Hap, but his arrogant attitude gets on Linda's nerves. She is particularly annoyed by his nickname for her, "freckle nose". The two are attracted to each other despite themselves, though Hap does not realize it.

When Johnny gets arrested for a routine brawl, he is soon released. However, he decides it is time to move on, as his fingerprints were taken. After he leaves though, Hap is injured in an accident. Johnny is the only one who can take over, so Linda catches him and persuades him to come back.

They finally admit they love each other. Johnny tells her he killed a man in self-defense, and they plan to go to the [[Venezuela]] oil fields. When Hap recovers enough to come back, he finds out and tries to dissuade them.

The well hits water, but Hap knows the same thing happened at a nearby successful well. He has them continue digging, and they strike oil.

Johnny leaves just in time, as policemen come looking for him, having matched him to his fingerprints. However, lightning sets the oil well ablaze. A crane is needed to put the fire out, but the driver refuses to go any further on the dangerous, rain-soaked, landslide-prone road.  Johnny takes his place, and the fire is put out. He is taken into custody afterward, but Linda goes with him to face the charge.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6639">'''Hydrous [[pyrolysis]]''' refers to the [[thermal decomposition]] which takes place when [[organic compounds]] are heated to high temperatures in the presence of [[water]].

Many hydrous pyrolysis processes use [[superheated water]] in the liquid phase, whereas [[Cracking (chemistry)#Steam cracking|steam cracking]] uses water in the [[gas]] phase. Steam cracking is used in the [[petroleum]] industry to produce the lighter [[alkene]]s.

Hydrous pyrolysis may be a significant process in the creation of [[fossil fuel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Pennisi, Elizabeth, [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Surreptitiously+converting+dead+matter+into+oil+and+coal.-a013528247 Surreptitiously converting dead matter into oil and coal - Water, Water Everywhere], Science News, February 20, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Simple heating without water, anhydrous [[pyrolysis]] has long been considered to take place naturally during the [[catagenesis (geology)|catagenesis]] of [[kerogen]]s to fossil fuels. In recent decades it has been found that water under pressure causes more efficient breakdown of kerogens at lower temperatures than without it. The carbon [[isotope]] ratio of [[natural gas]] also suggests that [[hydrogen]] from water has been added during creation of the gas.

U.S. patent 2,177,557,&lt;ref&gt;Bergstrom et al., [http://www.google.com/patents?id=-MlwAAAAEBAJ Method of treating wood or lignine or cellulose containing materials for obtaining valuable products], U.S. Patent 2,177,557, issued 24 October 1939&lt;/ref&gt; describes a two-stage process in which a mixture of water, [[wood chips]], and [[calcium hydroxide]] is heated in the first stage at temperatures in a range of {{convert|220|to|360|C|F}}, with the pressure "higher than that of saturated steam at the temperature used." This produces "oils and alcohols" which are collected. The materials are then subjected in a second stage to what is called "dry distillation", which produces "oils and ketones". Temperatures and pressures for this Second stage are not disclosed.

Zhang et al.,&lt;ref&gt;Zhang et al.,. (1999). [http://www.age.uiuc.edu/bee/RESEARCH/tcc/tccpaper3.htm Thermochemical Conversion of Swine Manure to Produce Fuel and Reduce Waste.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515195211/http://www.age.uiuc.edu/bee/RESEARCH/tcc/tccpaper3.htm |date=2008-05-15 }} University of Illinois.&lt;/ref&gt; at the University of Illinois, report on a hydrous pyrolysis process in which swine manure is converted to oil by heating the swine manure and water in the presence of carbon monoxide in a closed container. For that process they report that a temperatures of at least {{convert|275|°C|°F|abbr=on}} is required to convert the swine manure to oil, and temperatures above about {{convert|335|°C|°F|abbr=on}} reduces the amount of oil produced. The Zhang ''et al.'' process produces pressures of about 7 to 18 [[Pascal (unit)|Mpa]] (1000 to 2600 [[Pounds per square inch|psi]] - 69 to 178 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]]), with higher temperatures producing higher pressures. Zhang et al. used a retention time of 120 minutes for the reported study, but report at higher temperatures a time of less than 30 minutes results in significant production of oil.

A commercialized process&lt;ref&gt;See Appel et al., published U. S. patent application US [http://www.google.com/patents?id=VrGfAAAAEBAJ 2004/0192980], publication date September 30, 2004, now patent [http://www.google.com/patents/US8003833 8,003,833], issued August 23, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; using hydrous pyrolysis (see the article [[Thermal depolymerization]]) used by Changing World Technologies, Inc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1551">'''Ingres paper''' is a type of [[drawing]] [[paper]]. It is a [[laid paper|laid finish paper]] of light to medium [[paper density|weight]], and it is not as strong or as durable as [[Bristol paper]]. Laid finish refers to the imprint of regular screen pattern of a papermaker's mould. Ingres is not necessarily a handmade paper, but is produced to replicate the properties of laid paper. Ingres is often used for [[charcoal]] and [[pastel]] drawing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Saitzyk|first=Steven|title=Art Hardware: The Definitive Guide to Artists' Materials|year=1987|publisher=Watson-Guptill|location=New York|isbn=0-8230-0266-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used as an [[endpaper]] in books.

The development of ingres paper for drawing is ascribed to the French Neoclassical artist [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Dominique Ingres]] (1780-1867), although modern ingres papers can differ from those actually used by Ingres. Important is that the pattern is a laid mesh. The laid effect creates a toothy grain of close lines on one side and a mottled surface on the reverse. The toothiness allows the paper to take charcoal easily and evenly. Ingres paper is favored in book arts for its antique appearance and [[pH]] neutrality.

Prominent manufactures include [[Canson]], [[Hahnemühle]] (sometimes called "German Ingres"), and [[Fabriano Miliani|Fabriano]]. Ingres paper has a high rag content (around 65%) and is gelatin [[sizing|sized]]. It is available in a variety of colors.

'''Iron''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Fe''' (from {{lang-la|[[Wikt:ferrum|ferrum]]}}) and [[atomic number]] 26. It is a [[metal]] in the [[first transition series]]. It is by mass the most common element on [[Earth]], forming much of Earth's [[outer core|outer]] and [[inner core]]. It is the fourth most common [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|element in the Earth's crust]]. Its abundance in [[Terrestrial planet|rocky planets]] like Earth is due to its abundant production by [[Nuclear fusion|fusion]] in high-mass [[star]]s, where it is the last element to be produced with release of energy before the violent collapse of a [[type II supernova|supernova]], which scatters the iron into space.

Like the other [[group 8 element]]s, [[ruthenium]] and [[osmium]], iron exists in a wide range of [[oxidation state]]s, −2 to +7, although +2 and +3 are the most common. Elemental iron occurs in [[meteoroid]]s and other low [[oxygen]] environments, but is reactive to oxygen and [[water]]. Fresh iron surfaces appear lustrous silvery-gray, but [[oxidize]] in normal air to give [[hydrate]]d [[iron oxide]]s, commonly known as [[rust]]. Unlike the metals that form [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivating]] oxide layers, iron oxides occupy more volume than the metal and thus flake off, exposing fresh surfaces for corrosion.

Iron metal has been used since [[iron age|ancient times]], although [[List of copper alloys|copper alloys]], which have lower melting temperatures, were used even earlier in human history. Pure iron is relatively soft, but is unobtainable by [[smelting]] because it is significantly hardened and strengthened by impurities, in particular [[carbon]], from the smelting process. A certain proportion of carbon (between 0.002% and 2.1%) produces [[steel]], which may be up to 1000&amp;nbsp;times harder than pure iron. Crude iron metal is produced in [[blast furnace]]s, where ore is reduced by [[coke (fuel)|coke]] to [[pig iron]], which has a high carbon content. Further refinement with oxygen reduces the carbon content to the correct proportion to make steel. Steels and iron [[alloy]]s formed with other metals ([[alloy steel]]s) are by far the most common industrial metals because they have a great range of desirable properties and iron-bearing rock is abundant.

Iron chemical compounds have many uses. Iron oxide mixed with aluminium powder can be ignited to create a [[Thermite|thermite reaction]], used in welding and purifying ores. Iron forms binary compounds with the [[halogens]] and the [[chalcogens]]. Among its organometallic compounds is [[ferrocene]], the first [[sandwich compound]] discovered.

[[Iron#Biological and pathological role|Iron plays an important role in biology]], forming complexes with molecular oxygen in [[hemoglobin]] and [[myoglobin]]; these two compounds are common [[oxygen transport]] proteins in vertebrates. Iron is also the metal at the active site of many important [[redox]] [[enzymes]] dealing with [[cellular respiration]] and [[oxidation and reduction]] in plants and animals. In adult human males are some 3.8 grams of iron, and 2.3 grams in females, for whom iron is distributed in [[hemoglobin]] and throughout the body. Iron is a critical element in the [[metabolism]] of hundreds of [[protein]]s and [[enzyme]]s involved in diverse body functions, such as [[oxygen transport]], [[DNA]] synthesis, and [[cell growth]].&lt;ref name="lpi"&gt;{{cite web|title=Iron|url=http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/minerals/iron|publisher=Micronutrient Information Center, Linus Pauling Institute, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon|accessdate=6 March 2018|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mechanical properties of iron and its alloys can be evaluated using a variety of tests, including the [[Brinell scale|Brinell test]], [[Rockwell scale|Rockwell test]] and the [[Vickers hardness test]]. The data on iron is so consistent that it is often used to calibrate measurements or to compare tests.&lt;ref name=corr/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://mdmetric.com/tech/hardnessconversion.html| title=Hardness Conversion Chart| accessdate=23 May 2010| publisher=Maryland Metrics| deadurl=bot: unknown| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150618071701/http://mdmetric.com/tech/hardnessconversion.html| archivedate=18 June 2015| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the mechanical properties of iron are significantly affected by the sample's purity: pure, single crystals of iron are actually softer than aluminium,&lt;ref name=pure/&gt; and the purest industrially produced iron (99.99%) has a hardness of 20–30&amp;nbsp;Brinell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title=Properties of Various Pure Irons: Study on pure iron I| url=http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110001459778/en| volume=50| issue=1| pages=42–47| journal=Tetsu-to-Hagane| first1 = Kusakawa|last1 = Takaji|first2 = Otani|last2 =Toshikatsu| date=1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; An increase in the carbon content will cause a significant increase in the hardness and tensile strength of iron.

[[File:Iron-alpha-pV.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.1|Molar volume vs. pressure for α iron at room temperature]]
Because of its significance for planetary cores, the physical properties of iron at high pressures and temperatures have also been studied extensively. The form of iron that is stable under standard conditions can be subjected to pressures up to ca. 15&amp;nbsp;GPa before transforming into a high-pressure form, as described in the next section.

===Phase diagram and allotropes===
{{Main|Allotropes of iron}}
Iron represents an example of [[allotropy]] in a metal. At least four allotropic forms of iron are known as α, γ, δ, and ε; at very high pressures and temperatures, some controversial experimental evidence exists for a stable β phase.&lt;ref name="beta-iron"&gt;{{Cite journal| first = Reinhard| last = Boehler|title = High-pressure experiments and the phase diagram of lower mantle and core materials| journal = Reviews of Geophysics| volume = 38| pages = 221–245| publisher = American Geophysical Union| date = 2000| doi=10.1029/1998RG000053| issue = 2| bibcode=2000RvGeo..38..221B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As molten iron cools past its freezing point of 1538&amp;nbsp;°C, it crystallizes into its δ allotrope, which has a [[body-centered cubic]] (bcc) [[crystal structure]]. As it cools further to 1394&amp;nbsp;°C, it changes to its γ-iron allotrope, a [[face-centered cubic]] (fcc) crystal structure, or [[austenite]]. At 912&amp;nbsp;°C and below, the crystal structure again becomes the bcc α-iron allotrope. Finally, at 770&amp;nbsp;°C (the [[Curie point]], T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;) iron's magnetic ordering changes from [[paramagnetic]] to [[ferromagnetic]]. As it passes through the Curie temperature, iron does not change its structure, but "magnetic domains" appear, where each domain contains iron atoms with a particular electronic spin. In unmagnetized iron, all the electronic spins of the atoms within one domain have the same axis orientation; however, the electrons of neighboring domains have other orientations with the result of mutual cancellation and no magnetic field. In magnetized iron, the electronic spins of the domains are aligned and the magnetic effects are reinforced. Although each domain contains billions of atoms, they are very small, about 10&amp;nbsp;micrometres across.&lt;ref name="Metallo"&gt;{{Cite book| url={{Google books|hoM8VJHTt24C|page=PA24|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|pages=24–28|title =Metallographer's guide: practice and procedures for irons and steels|first1 = B.

At pressures above approximately 10 GPa and temperatures of a few hundred kelvin or less, α-iron changes into a [[hexagonal close-packed]] (hcp) structure, which is also known as [[Hexaferrum|ε-iron]]; the higher-temperature γ-phase also changes into ε-iron, but does so at higher pressure. The β-phase, if it exists, would appear at pressures of at least 50 GPa and temperatures of at least 1500 K and have an orthorhombic or a double hcp structure.&lt;ref name="beta-iron" /&gt; These high-pressure phases of iron are important as endmember models for the solid parts of planetary cores. The [[inner core]] of the [[Earth]] is generally presumed to be an iron-[[nickel]] [[alloy]] with ε (or β) structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stixrude|first=Lars|last2=Wasserman|first2=Evgeny|last3=Cohen|first3=Ronald E.|date=1997-11-10|title=Composition and temperature of Earth's inner core|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth|volume=102|issue=B11|pages=24729–24739|doi=10.1029/97JB02125|bibcode=1997JGR...10224729S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Somewhat confusingly, the term "β-iron" is sometimes also used to refer to α-iron above its Curie point, when it changes from being ferromagnetic to paramagnetic, even though its crystal structure has not changed.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1075/&gt;

The melting point of iron is experimentally well defined for pressures less than 50&amp;nbsp;GPa. For greater pressures, studies put the γ-ε-liquid [[triple point]] at pressures that differ by tens of gigapascals and 1000&amp;nbsp;K in the melting point. Generally speaking, [[molecular dynamics]] computer simulations of iron melting and shock wave experiments suggest higher melting points and a much steeper slope of the melting curve than static experiments carried out in [[diamond anvil cell]]s.&lt;ref name="melting"&gt;{{Cite book| pages=527–541|doi=10.1016/B978-044452748-6.00047-X|title =Mineral Physics|first1 = Reinhard|last1 = Boehler|first2= M.|last2 = Ross|chapter = Properties of Rocks and Minerals_High-Pressure Melting|publisher = Elsevier| date = 2007| series = Treatise on Geophysics| volume = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The melting and boiling points of iron, along with its [[enthalpy of atomization]], are lower than those of the earlier 3d elements from [[scandium]] to [[chromium]], showing the lessened contribution of the 3d electrons to metallic bonding as they are attracted more and more into the inert core by the nucleus;&lt;ref name=Greenwood1116&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1116&lt;/ref&gt; however, they are higher than the values for the previous element [[manganese]] because that element has a half-filled 3d subshell and consequently its d-electrons are not easily delocalized. This same trend appears for ruthenium but not osmium.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1074/&gt;

===Isotopes===
{{Main|Isotopes of iron}}

Naturally occurring iron consists of four stable [[isotope]]s: 5.845% of &lt;sup&gt;54&lt;/sup&gt;Fe, 91.754% of [[Iron-56|&lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;Fe]], 2.119% of &lt;sup&gt;57&lt;/sup&gt;Fe and 0.282% of &lt;sup&gt;58&lt;/sup&gt;Fe. Of these stable isotopes, only &lt;sup&gt;57&lt;/sup&gt;Fe has a nuclear [[spin (physics)|spin]] (−{{frac|1|2}}). The [[nuclide]] &lt;sup&gt;54&lt;/sup&gt;Fe theoretically can undergo [[double beta decay|double electron capture]] to &lt;sup&gt;54&lt;/sup&gt;Cr, but the process has never been observed and only a lower limit on the half-life of 3.1×10&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; years has been established.&lt;ref name=NUBASE&gt;{{cite journal|date=2003 |title=The NUBASE evaluation of nuclear and decay properties |url=http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/amdc/nubase/Nubase2003.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080923135135/http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/amdc/nubase/Nubase2003.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-09-23 |journal=[[Nuclear Physics A]] |volume=729 |pages=3–128 |doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001 |bibcode=2003NuPhA.729....3A |last1=Audi |first1=G. |last2=Bersillon |first2=O. |last3=Blachot |first3=J. |last4=Wapstra |first4=A.

&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Fe is an [[extinct radionuclide]] of long [[half-life]] (2.6&amp;nbsp;million years).&lt;ref name="RugelFaestermann2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rugel|first1=G.|last2=Faestermann|first2=T.|last3=Knie|first3=K.|last4=Korschinek|first4=G.|last5=Poutivtsev|first5=M.|last6=Schumann|first6=D.|last7=Kivel|first7=N.|last8=Günther-Leopold|first8=I.|last9=Weinreich|first9=R.|last10=Wohlmuther|first10=M.|title=New Measurement of the &lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Fe Half-Life|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=103|issue=7|pages=072502|date=2009|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.103.072502|pmid=19792637|bibcode=2009PhRvL.103g2502R}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not found on Earth, but its ultimate decay product is its granddaughter, the stable nuclide [[nickel-60|&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Ni]].&lt;ref name=NUBASE/&gt; Much of the past work on isotopic composition of iron has focused on the [[nucleosynthesis]] of &lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Fe through studies of [[meteorite]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and ore formation. In the last decade, advances in [[mass spectrometry]] have allowed the detection and quantification of minute, naturally occurring variations in the ratios of the [[stable isotope]]s of iron. Much of this work is driven by the [[Earth science|Earth]] and [[planetary science]] communities, although applications to biological and industrial systems are emerging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Dauphas|first1=N.|last2=Rouxel|first2=O.|date=2006|title=Mass spectrometry and natural variations of iron isotopes|journal=Mass Spectrometry Reviews|volume=25|pages=515–550|url=http://geosci.uchicago.edu/~dauphas/OLwebsite/PDFfiles/Dauphas_Rouxel_MSR06.pdf|doi=10.1002/mas.20078|pmid=16463281|issue=4|bibcode=2006MSRv...25..515D|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610095913/http://geosci.uchicago.edu/~dauphas/OLwebsite/PDFfiles/Dauphas_Rouxel_MSR06.pdf|archivedate=10 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In phases of the meteorites ''Semarkona'' and ''Chervony Kut,'' a correlation between the concentration of &lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Ni, the [[daughter product|granddaughter]] of &lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Fe, and the abundance of the stable iron isotopes provided evidence for the existence of &lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Fe at the time of [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System|formation of the Solar System]]. Possibly the energy released by the decay of &lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Fe, along with that released by [[aluminium-26|&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al]], contributed to the remelting and [[planetary differentiation|differentiation]] of [[asteroid]]s after their formation 4.6&amp;nbsp;billion years ago. The abundance of &lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Ni present in [[wikt:extraterrestrial|extraterrestrial]] material may bring further insight into the origin and early history of the [[Solar System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.newar.2003.11.022|title=Evidence for live 60Fe in meteorites|date=2004|last1=Mostefaoui|first1=S.|last2=Lugmair|first2=G.

The most abundant iron isotope &lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;Fe is of particular interest to nuclear scientists because it represents the most common endpoint of [[nucleosynthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fewell|first1=M.

This &lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;Ni, which has a half-life of about 6&amp;nbsp;days, is created in quantity in these stars, but soon decays by two successive positron emissions within supernova decay products in the [[supernova remnant]] gas cloud, first to radioactive &lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;Co, and then to stable &lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;Fe. As such, iron is the most abundant element in the core of [[red giant]]s, and is the most abundant metal in [[iron meteorite]]s and in the dense metal [[Planetary core|cores of planets]] such as [[Earth]].&lt;ref name=Greenwood12&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; It is also very common in the universe, relative to other stable [[Metallicity|metals]] of approximately the same [[Atomic mass|atomic weight]].&lt;ref name=Greenwood12/&gt;&lt;ref name="WoosleyJanka"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Woosley | first1=S.  | last2=Janka | first2=T. | title=The physics of core collapse supernovae | year=2006 | arxiv=astro-ph/0601261 | doi=10.1038/nphys172 | volume=1 | issue=3  | journal=Nature Physics | pages=147–154| bibcode=2005NatPh...1..147W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Iron is the sixth most [[Abundance of the chemical elements|abundant element]] in the [[Universe]], and the most common [[refractory]] element.&lt;ref name=apjl717_2_L92&gt;{{cite journal

Although a further tiny energy gain could be extracted by synthesizing [[nickel-62|&lt;sup&gt;62&lt;/sup&gt;Ni]], which has a marginally higher binding energy than &lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;Fe, conditions in stars are unsuitable for this process. Element production in supernovas and distribution on Earth greatly favor iron over nickel, and in any case, &lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;Fe still has a lower mass per nucleon than &lt;sup&gt;62&lt;/sup&gt;Ni due to its higher fraction of lighter protons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Iron and Nickel Abundances in H~II Regions and Supernova Remnants|date = 1995|bibcode=1995AAS...186.3707B|author=Bautista, Manuel A.|author2=Pradhan, Anil K.|journal=Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society|volume=27|page=865}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, elements heavier than iron require a [[supernova]] for their formation, involving [[r-process|rapid neutron capture]] by starting &lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;Fe nuclei.&lt;ref name=Greenwood12/&gt;

Metallic or [[native iron]] is rarely found on the surface of the Earth because it tends to oxidize, but its oxides are pervasive and represent the primary ores.

The mentioned iron compounds have been used as [[pigment]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s (compare [[ochre]]) since historical time and contribute as well to the color of various geological formations, e.g. the [[Buntsandstein]] (British [[Bunter (geology)|Bunter]], colored sandstein).&lt;ref&gt;Dickinson, Robert E.

Significant amounts of iron occur in the iron sulfide mineral [[pyrite]] (FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), but it is difficult to extract iron from it and it is therefore not used. In fact, iron is so common that production generally focuses only on ores with very high quantities of it. During [[weathering]], iron tends to leach from sulfide deposits as the sulfate and from silicate deposits as the bicarbonate. Both of these are oxidized in aqueous solution and precipitate in even mildly elevated pH as [[iron(III) oxide]].&lt;ref name="Greenwood1071"&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1071&lt;/ref&gt;

About 1 in 20 [[meteorite]]s consist of the unique iron-nickel minerals [[taenite]] (35–80% iron) and [[kamacite]] (90–95% iron). Although rare, [[iron meteorite]]s are the main form of natural metallic iron on the Earth's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| url={{Google books|QDU7AAAAIAAJ|page=PA152|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|page =152|title = Planet earth: cosmology, geology, and the evolution of life and environment|journal =Cambridge &amp;#91;England&amp;#93; ; New York : Cambridge University Press|first = Cesare|last = Emiliani|publisher = Cambridge University Press|date = 1992|isbn = 978-0-521-40949-0|bibcode =1992pecg.book.....E}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[International Resource Panel]]'s [[Metal Stocks in Society report]], the global stock of iron in use in society is 2200&amp;nbsp;kg per capita.

Iron shows the characteristic chemical properties of the [[transition metal]]s, namely the ability to form variable oxidation states differing by steps of one and a very large coordination and organometallic chemistry: indeed, it was the discovery of an iron compound, [[ferrocene]], that revolutionalized the latter field in the 1950s.&lt;ref name=Greenwood905&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 905&lt;/ref&gt; Iron is sometimes considered as a prototype for the entire block of transition metals, due to its abundance and the immense role it has played in the technological progress of humanity.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1070/&gt; Its 26 electrons are arranged in the [[electron configuration|configuration]] [Ar]3d&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;4s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, of which the 3d and 4s electrons are relatively close in energy, and thus it can lose a variable number of electrons and there is no clear point where further ionization becomes unprofitable.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1074/&gt;

Iron forms compounds mainly in the +2 and +3 [[oxidation state]]s. Traditionally, iron(II) compounds are called [[ferrous]], and iron(III) compounds [[ferric]]. Iron also occurs in [[high-valent iron|higher oxidation states]], e.g. the purple [[potassium ferrate]] (K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;FeO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), which contains iron in its +6 oxidation state. Although iron(VIII) oxide (FeO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) has been claimed, the report could not be reproduced and such a species (at least with iron in its +8 oxidation state) has been found to be improbable computationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huang|first=Wei|last2=Xu|first2=Wen-Hua|last3=Schwarz|first3=W.

Iron is the first of the transition metals that cannot reach its group oxidation state of +8, although its heavier congeners ruthenium and osmium can, with ruthenium having more difficulty than osmium.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1075/&gt; Ruthenium exhibits an aqueous cationic chemistry in its low oxidation states similar to that of iron, but osmium does not, favoring high oxidation states in which it forms anionic complexes.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1075/&gt; In the second half of the 3d transition series, vertical similarities down the groups compete with the horizontal similarities of iron with its neighbors [[cobalt]] and [[nickel]] in the periodic table, which are also ferromagnetic at [[room temperature]] and share similar chemistry. As such, iron, cobalt, and nickel are sometimes grouped together as the [[iron triad]].&lt;ref name=Greenwood1070&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1070&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Iron(III) chloride hexahydrate.jpg|thumb|alt=Some canary-yellow powder sits, mostly in lumps, on a laboratory watch glass.|Hydrated [[iron(III) chloride]], also known as ferric chloride]]

The iron compounds produced on the largest scale in industry are [[iron(II) sulfate]] (FeSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·7[[Water of crystallization|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]]) and [[iron(III) chloride]] (FeCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). The former is one of the most readily available sources of iron(II), but is less stable to aerial oxidation than [[Mohr's salt]] ((NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·6H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O). Iron(II) compounds tend to be oxidized to iron(III) compounds in the air.&lt;ref name="HollemanAF" /&gt;

Unlike many other metals, iron does not form amalgams with [[mercury (element)|mercury]]. As a result, mercury is traded in standardized 76 pound flasks (34&amp;nbsp;kg) made of iron.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Hand-book of chemistry|volume = 6| first = Leopold|last1 = Gmelin|authorlink = Leopold Gmelin|pages = 128–129| chapter = Mercury and Iron|url={{Google books|nosMAAAAYAAJ|page=PA128|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|publisher = Cavendish Society|date = 1852}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iron is by far the most reactive element in its group; it is pyrophoric when finely divided and dissolves easily in dilute acids, giving Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. However, it does not react with concentrated [[nitric acid]] and other oxidizing acids due to the formation of an impervious oxide layer, which can nevertheless react with [[hydrochloric acid]].&lt;ref name=Greenwood1075/&gt;

===Binary compounds===
Iron reacts with oxygen in the air to form various [[iron oxide|oxide and hydroxide compounds]]; the most common are [[iron(II,III) oxide]] (Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[iron(III) oxide]] (Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). [[Iron(II) oxide]] also exists, though it is unstable at room temperature. Despite their names, they are actually all [[non-stoichiometric compound]]s whose compositions may vary.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1079/&gt; These oxides are the principal ores for the production of iron (see [[bloomery]] and blast furnace). They are also used in the production of [[Ferrite (magnet)|ferrites]], useful [[magnetic storage]] media in computers, and pigments. The best known sulfide is [[iron pyrite]] (FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), also known as fool's gold owing to its golden luster.&lt;ref name="HollemanAF" /&gt; It is not an iron(IV) compound, but is actually an iron(II) [[polysulfide]] containing Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and {{chem|S|2|2-}} ions in a distorted [[sodium chloride]] structure.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1079&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1079&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pourbaix Diagram of Iron.svg|thumb|right|[[Pourbaix diagram]] of iron]]
The binary ferrous and ferric halides are well-known, with the exception of ferric iodide. The ferrous halides typically arise from treating iron metal with the corresponding [[hydrohalic acid]] to give the corresponding hydrated salts.&lt;ref name="HollemanAF" /&gt;
:Fe + 2 HX → FeX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (X = F, Cl, Br, I)
Iron reacts with fluorine, chlorine, and bromine to give the corresponding ferric halides, [[ferric chloride]] being the most common.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1082/&gt;
:2 Fe + 3 X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 FeX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (X = F, Cl, Br)
Ferric iodide is an exception, being thermodynamically unstable due to the oxidizing power of Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and the high reducing power of I&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;ref name=Greenwood1082/&gt;
:2 I&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; → I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (E&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = +0.23 V)

Nevertheless, milligram amounts of ferric iodide, a black solid, may still be prepared through the reaction of [[iron pentacarbonyl]] with [[iodine]] and [[carbon monoxide]] in the presence of [[hexane]] and light at the temperature of −20&amp;nbsp;°C, making sure that the system is well sealed off from air and water.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1082/&gt;

The red-purple tetrahedral [[ferrate]](VI) anion is such a strong oxidizing agent that it oxidizes nitrogen and ammonia at room temperature, and even water itself in acidic or neutral solutions:&lt;ref name=Greenwood1082&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1082–4&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ion has a large simple cationic chemistry, although the pale-violet hexaquo ion [Fe(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; is very readily hydrolyzed when pH increases above 0 as follows:&lt;ref name=Greenwood1088&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 1088–91&lt;/ref&gt;

As pH rises above 0 the above yellow hydrolyzed species form and as it rises above 2–3, reddish-brown hydrous [[iron(III) oxide]] precipitates out of solution. Although Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; has an d&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; configuration, its absorption spectrum is not like that of Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; with its weak, spin-forbidden d–d bands, because Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; has higher positive charge and is more polarizing, lowering the energy of its ligand-to-metal [[charge-transfer complex|charge transfer]] absorptions. Thus, all the above complexes are rather strongly colored, with the single exception of the hexaquo ion – and even that has a spectrum dominated by charge transfer in the near ultraviolet region.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1088/&gt; On the other hand, the pale green iron(II) hexaquo ion [Fe(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; does not undergo appreciable hydrolysis. Carbon dioxide is not evolved when [[carbonate]] anions are added, which instead results in white [[iron(II) carbonate]] being precipitated out. In excess carbon dioxide this forms the slightly soluble bicarbonate, which occurs commonly in groundwater, but it oxidises quickly in air to form [[iron(III) oxide]] that accounts for the brown deposits present in a sizeable number of streams.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1091&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1091–7&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prussian blue]], Fe&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, is the most famous of the cyanide complexes of iron.  Its formation can be used as a simple wet chemistry test to distinguish between aqueous solutions of Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; as they react (respectively) with [[potassium ferricyanide]] and [[potassium ferrocyanide]] to form Prussian blue.&lt;ref name="HollemanAF" /&gt;

[[File:Pentaaqua(thiocyanato)iron(III) chloride.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|right|Blood-red positive thiocyanate test for iron(III)]]
Iron(III) complexes are quite similar to those of [[chromium]](III) with the exception of iron(III)'s preference for ''O''-donor instead of ''N''-donor ligands. The latter tend to be rather more unstable than iron(II) complexes and often dissociate in water. Many Fe–O complexes show intense colors and are used as tests for [[phenol]]s or [[enol]]s. For example, in the [[ferric chloride test]], used to determine the presence of phenols, [[iron(III) chloride]] reacts with a phenol to form a deep violet complex:&lt;ref name=Greenwood1088/&gt;

:3 ArOH + FeCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → Fe(OAr)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 HCl (Ar = [[aryl]])

Among the halide and pseudohalide complexes, fluoro complexes of iron(III) are the most stable, with the colorless [FeF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; being the most stable in aqueous solution. Chloro complexes are less stable and favor tetrahedral coordination as in [FeCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;; [FeBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; and [FeI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; are reduced easily to iron(II). [[Thiocyanate]] is a common test for the presence of iron(III) as it forms the blood-red [Fe(SCN)(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Like manganese(II), most iron(III) complexes are high-spin, the exceptions being those with ligands that are high in the [[spectrochemical series]] such as [[cyanide]]. An example of a low-spin iron(III) complex is [Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;. The cyanide ligands may easily be detached in [Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;, and hence this complex is poisonous, unlike the iron(II) complex [Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt; found in Prussian blue,&lt;ref name=Greenwood1088/&gt; which does not release [[hydrogen cyanide]] except when dilute acids are added.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1091/&gt; Iron shows a great variety of electronic [[spin states (d electrons)|spin states]], including every possible spin quantum number value for a d-block element from 0 (diamagnetic) to {{frac|5|2}} (5 unpaired electrons). This value is always half the number of unpaired electrons. Complexes with zero to two unpaired electrons are considered low-spin and those with four or five are considered high-spin.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1079/&gt;

Iron(II) complexes are less stable than iron(III) complexes but the preference for ''O''-donor ligands is less marked, so that for example [Fe(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is known while [Fe(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; is not. They have a tendency to be oxidized to iron(III) but this can be moderated by low pH and the specific ligands used.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1091/&gt;

Cyanide complexes are technically [[organometallic compound|organometallic]] but more important are [[carbon monoxide|carbonyl]] complexes and [[sandwich compound|sandwich]] and [[half-sandwich compound]]s.  The premier iron(0) compound is [[iron pentacarbonyl]], Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, which is used to produce [[carbonyl iron]] powder, a highly reactive form of metallic iron. Thermolysis of iron pentacarbonyl gives the trinuclear cluster, [[triiron dodecacarbonyl]]. Collman's reagent, [[disodium tetracarbonylferrate]], is a useful reagent for organic chemistry; it contains iron in the −2 oxidation state. [[Cyclopentadienyliron dicarbonyl dimer]] contains iron in the rare +1 oxidation state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw1st|pages=1282–86}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Beowulf - iren.jpg|thumb|"iren," an Old English word for 'iron']]
As iron has been in use for such a long time, it has many different names in different languages. The source of its chemical symbol ''Fe'' is the Latin word ''ferrum'', and its descendants are the names of the element in the [[Romance language]]s (for example, [[French language|French]] ''fer'', [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''hierro'', and [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''ferro'').&lt;ref name=vanderkrogt&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elements.vanderkrogt.net/element.php?sym=fe |title=26 Iron  |publisher=Elements.vanderkrogt.net |accessdate=2008-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''ferrum'' itself possibly comes from the [[Semitic language]]s, via [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]], from a root that also gave rise to [[Old English language|Old English]] ''bræs'' "[[brass]]".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=ferro-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 |title=ferro- |last1=Harper |first1=Douglas |date=2001–16 |website=etymonline.com |access-date=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The English word ''iron'' derives ultimately from [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] ''*isarnan'', which is also the source of the German name ''Eisen''. It was most likely borrowed from [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] ''*isarnon'', which ultimately comes from [[Proto-Indo-European]] ''*is-(e)ro-'' "powerful, holy" and finally ''*eis'' "strong", referencing iron's strength as a metal.&lt;ref&gt;

The first iron production started in the [[Middle Bronze Age]] but it took several centuries before iron displaced bronze. Samples of [[smelting|smelted]] iron from [[Asmar]], Mesopotamia and Tall Chagar Bazaar in northern Syria were made sometime between 3000 and 2700&amp;nbsp;BC.{{sfn|Weeks|1968|p=32}} The [[Hittites]] established an empire in north-central [[Anatolia]] around 1600 BC.

During the Industrial Revolution in Britain, [[Henry Cort]] began refining iron from [[pig iron]] to [[wrought iron]] (or bar iron) using innovative production systems. In 1783 he patented the [[Puddling (metallurgy)|puddling process]] for refining iron ore. It was later improved by others, including [[Joseph Hall (metallurgist)|Joseph Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1179/tns.1977.011|title=Dry and Wet Puddling|journal=Transactions of the Newcomen Society|volume=49|pages=156–157|year=2014|last1=Mott|first1=R.A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cast iron===
[[Cast iron]] was first produced in [[China]] during 5th century BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Wagner, Donald B.|url=https://hist-met.org/images/Journal_PDFs/37_1_p_25_Wagner.pdf|title=Chinese blast furnaces from the 10th to the 14th century|journal=Historical Metallurgy|volume=37|issue=1|date=2003|pages=25–37|access-date=7 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180107175015/https://hist-met.org/images/Journal_PDFs/37_1_p_25_Wagner.pdf|archive-date=7 January 2018|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}} originally published in {{Cite journal|first =Donald B.|last =Wagner|title=Chinese blast furnaces from the 10th to the 14th century|journal=West Asian Science, Technology, and Medicine|volume=18 |date=2001|pages=41–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was hardly in Europe until the medieval period.&lt;ref&gt;Giannichedda, Enrico (2007): [https://books.google.com/books?id=LAgxAJNXhFwC&amp;pg=PA200 "Metal production in Late Antiquity"], in ''Technology in Transition AD 300–650'' Lavan, L.; Zanini, E. and Sarantis, A.(eds.), Brill, Leiden; {{ISBN|90-04-16549-5}}, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Biddle"&gt;{{Cite book| title = Chemistry, Precision and Design|publisher = A Beka Book, Inc.|first1 = Verne|last1 =Biddle|first2= Gregory|last2 =Parker}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Missing page numbers (how would you add them?)--&gt; The earliest [[cast iron]] artifacts were discovered by archaeologists in what is now modern [[Luhe County]], [[Jiangsu]] in China.

For all these processes, [[charcoal]] was required as fuel.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1072/&gt;
[[File:Philipp Jakob Loutherbourg d. J. 002.jpg|thumb|''[[Coalbrookdale by Night]]'', 1801. Blast furnaces light the iron making town of [[Coalbrookdale]].]]
Medieval [[blast furnaces]] were about {{convert|10|ft|m}} tall and made of fireproof brick; forced air was usually provided by hand-operated bellows.&lt;ref name="Biddle" /&gt; Modern blast furnaces have grown much bigger, with hearths fourteen meters in diameter that allow them to produce thousands of tons of iron each day, but essentially operate in much the same way as they did during medieval times.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1072/&gt;

In 1709, [[Abraham Darby I]] established a [[Coke (fuel)|coke]]-fired blast furnace to produce cast iron, replacing charcoal, although continuing to use blast furnaces. The ensuing availability of inexpensive iron was one of the factors leading to the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Toward the end of the 18th century, cast iron began to replace wrought iron for certain purposes, because it was cheaper. Carbon content in iron was not implicated as the reason for the differences in properties of wrought iron, cast iron, and steel until the 18th century.{{sfn|Weeks|1968|p=32}}

Since iron was becoming cheaper and more plentiful, it also became a major structural material following the building of the innovative [[The Iron Bridge|first iron bridge]] in 1778. This bridge still stands today as a monument to the role iron played in the Industrial Revolution. Following this, iron was used in rails, boats, ships, aqueducts, and buildings, as well as in iron cylinders in [[steam engine]]s.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1072&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1072&lt;/ref&gt; Railways have been central to the formation of modernity and ideas of progress&lt;ref&gt;Schivelbusch, G. (1986) The Railway Journey: Industrialization and Perception of Time and Space in the 19th Century. Oxford: Berg.&lt;/ref&gt; and various languages (e.g. French, Spanish, Italian and German) refer to railways as ''iron road''.

===Steel===
{{See also|Steelmaking}}
Steel (with smaller carbon content than pig iron but more than wrought iron) was first produced in antiquity by using a [[bloomery]]. Blacksmiths in [[Luristan]] in western Persia were making good steel by 1000&amp;nbsp;BC.{{sfn|Weeks|1968|p=32}} Then improved versions, [[Wootz steel]] by India and [[Damascus steel]] were developed around 300&amp;nbsp;BC and AD&amp;nbsp;500 respectively. These methods were specialized, and so steel did not become a major commodity until the 1850s.&lt;ref&gt;Spoerl, Joseph S. [http://www.anselm.edu/homepage/dbanach/h-carnegie-steel.htm A Brief History of Iron and Steel Production] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602031459/http://www.anselm.edu/homepage/dbanach/h-carnegie-steel.htm |date=2 June 2010 }}. Saint Anselm College&lt;/ref&gt;

New methods of producing it by [[carburizing]] bars of iron in the [[cementation process]] were devised in the 17th century. In the [[Industrial Revolution]], new methods of producing bar iron without charcoal were devised and these were later applied to produce steel. In the late 1850s, [[Henry Bessemer]] invented a new steelmaking process, involving blowing air through molten pig iron, to produce mild steel. This made steel much more economical, thereby leading to wrought iron no longer being produced in large quantities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url={{Google books|fUmTX8yKU4gC|page=PA190|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}} | pages = 190–191 | title = Encyclopedia of the Elements: Technical Data – History – Processing – Applications | isbn = 978-3-527-61234-5 | author1 = Enghag | first1 = Per | date = 8 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foundations of modern chemistry===
In 1774, [[Antoine Lavoisier]] used the reaction of water steam with metallic iron inside an incandescent iron tube to produce [[hydrogen]] in his experiments leading to the demonstration of the [[conservation of mass]], which was instrumental in changing chemistry from a qualitative science to a quantitative one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ed052p658|title=An historical note on the conservation of mass|journal=Journal of Chemical Education|volume=52|issue=10|pages=658|year=1975|last1=Whitaker|first1=Robert D|bibcode=1975JChEd..52..658W}}

== Symbolic role ==
[[File:Eisernes Kreuz (1914).jpg|thumb|"''Gold gab ich für Eisen''" – "I gave gold for iron". [[German Americans|German-American]] brooch from WWI. ]]
Iron plays a certain role in mythology and has found various usage [[Iron (metaphor)|as a metaphor]] and in [[Iron in folklore|folklore]]. The [[Greeks|Greek]] poet [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Works and Days]]'' (lines 109–201) lists different [[ages of man]] named after metals like gold, silver, bronze and iron to account for successive ages of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1086/366027|jstor=268960|title=Work, Justice, and Hesiod's Five Ages|journal=Classical Philology|volume=69|pages=1–16|year=1974|last1=Fontenrose|first1=Joseph}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Iron Age was closely related with Rome, and in Ovid's ''Metamorphoses''

{{Quote|text=The Virtues, in despair, quit the earth; and the depravity of man becomes universal and complete. Hard steel succeeded then.|sign=Ovid|source=[[Metamorphoses]], Book I, Iron age, line 160 ff}}

An example of the importance of iron's symbolic role may be found in the [[German Campaign of 1813]]. [[Frederick William III]] commissioned then the first [[Iron Cross]] as military decoration. [[Berlin iron jewellery]] reached its peak production between 1813 and 1815, when the Prussian [[royal family]] urged citizens to donate gold and silver jewellery for military funding. The inscription ''Gold gab ich für Eisen'' (I gave gold for iron) was used as well in later war efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Eva (1981) ''Der preußische Eisenkunstguss.

===Industrial routes===
{{See also|Iron ore}}
The production of iron or steel is a process consisting of two main stages. In the first stage pig iron is produced in a blast furnace. Alternatively, it may be directly reduced. In the second stage, pig iron is converted to wrought iron, steel, or cast iron.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1073&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1073&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--https://books.google.com/books?id=xkVPNtRagDkC--&gt;
[[File:Chinese Fining and Blast Furnace.jpg|thumb|The fining process of smelting [[iron ore]] to make wrought iron from pig iron, with the right illustration displaying men working a blast furnace, from the ''Tiangong Kaiwu'' encyclopedia, published in 1637 by [[Song Yingxing]].]] [[File:Iron-Making.jpg|thumb|How iron was extracted in the 19th century]]

For a few limited purposes when it is needed, pure iron is produced in the laboratory in small quantities by reducing the pure oxide or hydroxide with hydrogen, or forming iron pentacarbonyl and heating it to 250&amp;nbsp;°C so that it decomposes to form pure iron powder.&lt;ref name="Greenwood1071"/&gt; Another method is electrolysis of ferrous chloride onto an iron cathode.&lt;ref&gt;Lux, H. (1963) "Metallic Iron" in ''Handbook of Preparative Inorganic Chemistry'', 2nd Ed. G. Brauer (ed.), Academic Press, NY. Vol. 2. pp. 1490–1.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Blast furnace processing====
{{Main|Blast furnace}}
Industrial iron production starts with iron ores, principally [[hematite]], which has a nominal formula Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and [[magnetite]], with the formula Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.  These ores are reduced to the metal in a [[carbothermic]] reaction, i.e. by treatment with carbon.  The conversion is typically conducted in a blast furnace at temperatures of about 2000&amp;nbsp;°C. Carbon is provided in the form of coke.  The process also contains a [[Flux (metallurgy)|flux]] such as [[limestone]], which is used to remove silicaceous minerals in the ore, which would otherwise clog the furnace.  The coke and limestone are fed into the top of the furnace, while a massive blast of [[Earth's atmosphere|air]] heated to 900&amp;nbsp;°C, about 4 tons per ton of iron,&lt;ref name="Biddle" /&gt; is forced into the furnace at the bottom.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1073/&gt;

In the furnace, the coke reacts with oxygen in the air blast to produce [[carbon monoxide]]:&lt;ref name=Greenwood1073/&gt;
:2 C + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 CO

The carbon monoxide reduces the iron ore (in the [[chemical equation]] below, hematite) to molten iron, becoming [[carbon dioxide]] in the process:&lt;ref name=Greenwood1073/&gt;
:Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 CO → 2 Fe + 3 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Some iron in the high-temperature lower region of the furnace reacts directly with the coke:&lt;ref name=Greenwood1073/&gt;
:2 Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 C → 4 Fe + 3 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

The flux present to melt impurities in the ore is principally [[limestone]] ([[calcium carbonate]]) and [[dolomite]] (calcium-magnesium carbonate). Other specialized fluxes are used depending on the details of the ore. In the heat of the furnace the limestone flux decomposes to [[calcium oxide]] (also known as quicklime):&lt;ref name=Greenwood1073/&gt;

:CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → CaO + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Then calcium oxide combines with silicon dioxide to form a liquid [[slag]].&lt;ref name=Greenwood1073/&gt;
:CaO + SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CaSiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

The slag melts in the heat of the furnace. In the bottom of the furnace, the molten slag floats on top of the denser molten iron, and apertures in the side of the furnace are opened to run off the iron and the slag separately. The iron, once cooled, is called pig iron, while the slag can be used as a material in [[road]] construction or to improve mineral-poor soils for [[agriculture]].&lt;ref name="Biddle" /&gt;
[[File:LightningVolt Iron Ore Pellets.jpg|thumb|This heap of iron ore pellets will be used in steel production.]]

====Direct iron reduction====
Owing to environmental concerns, alternative methods of processing iron have been developed. "[[Direct reduced iron|Direct iron reduction]]" [[Sponge iron reaction|reduces iron ore]] to a ferrous lump called [[sponge iron|"sponge" iron]] or "direct" iron that is suitable for steelmaking.&lt;ref name="Biddle" /&gt; Two main reactions comprise the direct reduction process:

Natural gas is partially oxidized (with heat and a catalyst):&lt;ref name=Biddle/&gt;
:2 CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 CO + 4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

These gases are then treated with iron ore in a furnace, producing solid sponge iron:&lt;ref name=Biddle/&gt;
:Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + CO + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 Fe + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

[[Silica]] is removed by adding a [[limestone]] flux as described above.&lt;ref name=Biddle/&gt;

====Thermite====
{{Main|Thermite}}
Iron is a byproduct of burning a mixture of aluminum powder and rust powder.

:Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 Al → 2 Fe + Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

====Further processes====
{{Main|Steelmaking|Ironworks}}
[[File:Melted raw-iron.jpg|thumb|right|A pot of molten iron being used to make steel]]
&lt;!-- Several other articles cover the material that might go into this section: please do not expand it excessively. This article concerns all aspects of the element iron, and should thus NOT be overburdened with details of metallurgy... Agree. Should be a summary. --&gt;
Pig iron is not pure iron, but has 4–5% carbon dissolved in it with small amounts of other impurities like sulfur, magnesium, phosphorus and manganese. As the carbon is the major impurity, the iron (pig iron) becomes brittle and hard.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1073/&gt; Removing the other impurities results in cast iron, which is used to cast articles in [[foundry|foundries]] such as stoves, pipes, radiators, lamp-posts and rails.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1073/&gt;

Alternatively pig iron may be made into steel (with up to about 2% carbon) or wrought iron (commercially pure iron). Various processes have been used for this, including [[finery forge]]s, [[Puddling (metallurgy)|puddling]] furnaces, [[Bessemer converter]]s, [[open hearth furnace]]s, [[basic oxygen furnace]]s, and [[electric arc furnace]]s. In all cases, the objective is to oxidize some or all of the carbon, together with other impurities. On the other hand, other metals may be added to make alloy steels.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1072/&gt;&lt;!-- why is this in production? The hardness of the steel depends upon its carbon content: the higher the percentage of carbon, the greater the hardness and the lesser the malleability. The properties of the steel can also be changed by several methods.--&gt;

[[Annealing (metallurgy)|Annealing]] involves the heating of a piece of steel to 700–800&amp;nbsp;°C for several hours and then gradual cooling. It makes the steel softer and more workable.&lt;ref name=Verhoeven&gt;Verhoeven, J.D. (1975) ''Fundamentals of Physical Metallurgy'', Wiley, New York, p. 326&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--why is this in production of iron?Steel may be hardened by [[cold working]]. The metal is bent or hammered into its final shape at a relatively cool temperature. Cold forging is the stamping of a piece of steel into shape by a heavy press. Wrenches are commonly made by cold forging. Cold rolling, which involves making a thinner but harder sheet, and cold drawing, which makes a thinner but stronger wire, are two other methods of cold working. To harden the steel, it is heated to red-hot and then cooled by quenching it in the water. It becomes harder and more brittle. If it is too hardened, it is then heated to a required temperature and allowed to cool. The steel thus formed is less brittle.

[[Heat treatment]] is another way to harden steel. The steel is heated red-hot, then cooled quickly. The iron carbide molecules are decomposed by the heat, but do not have time to reform. Since the free carbon atoms are stuck, it makes the steel much harder and stronger than before.&lt;ref name="Biddle" /&gt;

Sometimes both toughness and hardness are desired. A process called [[case hardening]] may be used. Steel is heated to about 900&amp;nbsp;°C then plunged into oil or water. Carbon from the oil can diffuse into the steel, making the surface very hard. The surface cools quickly, but the inside cools slowly, making an extremely hard surface and a durable, resistant inner layer.

Iron may be [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivated]] by dipping it into a concentrated [[nitric acid]] solution. This forms a protective layer of oxide on the metal, protecting it from further corrosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.euro-inox.org/pdf/map/Passivating_Pickling_EN.pdf |title=Picking and passivating stainless steel, Materials and Application Series, Volume 4 |publisher=Euro Inox |year=2007 |edition=2nd |isbn=978-2-87997-224-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

===Metallurgical===
{{see also|Steel}}
Iron is the most widely used of all the metals, accounting for over 90% of worldwide metal production.&lt;!-- The UGSG gives a production of iron including recycling with 998Mt, while aluminium (39Mt), copper (18Mt), zinc (11Mt) and lead (8.6Mt) add up to 77 Mt, all including recycling. This more like 8% than 5.--&gt; Its low cost and high strength make it indispensable in engineering applications such as the construction of machinery and [[machine tool]]s, [[automobile]]s, the [[hull (ship)|hulls]] of large [[ship]]s, and structural components for buildings. Since pure iron is quite soft, it is most commonly combined with alloying elements to make steel.&lt;ref name=Greenwood10701&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 1070–1&lt;/ref&gt;

α-Iron is a fairly soft metal that can dissolve only a small concentration of carbon (no more than 0.021% by mass at 910&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url={{Google books|xv420pEC2qMC|page=PA183|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}| page=183| title=Concise encyclopedia of the structure of materials| first=John Wilson|last = Martin| publisher=Elsevier| date= 2007|isbn=0-08-045127-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Austenite]] (γ-iron) is similarly soft and metallic but can dissolve considerably more carbon (as much as 2.04% by mass at 1146&amp;nbsp;°C). This form of iron is used in the type of [[stainless steel]] used for making cutlery, and hospital and food-service equipment.&lt;ref name="Metallo" /&gt;

Commercially available iron is classified based on purity and the abundance of additives. [[Pig iron]] has 3.5–4.5% carbon&lt;ref name="msts"&gt;{{Cite book|last1 = Camp|first1 = James McIntyre|last2 = Francis |first2 = Charles Blaine|title = The Making, Shaping and Treating of Steel|publisher = Carnegie Steel Company |date=1920|location = Pittsburgh|pages = 173–174|url={{Google books|P9MxAAAAMAAJ|page=|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|isbn = 1-147-64423-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contains varying amounts of contaminants such as [[sulfur]], silicon and [[phosphorus]]. Pig iron is not a saleable product, but rather an intermediate step in the production of cast iron and steel. The reduction of contaminants in pig iron that negatively affect material properties, such as sulfur and phosphorus, yields cast iron containing 2–4% carbon, 1–6% silicon, and small amounts of [[manganese]].&lt;ref name=Greenwood1073/&gt; Pig iron has a [[melting point]] in the range of 1420–1470&amp;nbsp;K, which is lower than either of its two main components, and makes it the first product to be melted when carbon and iron are heated together.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1075/&gt; Its mechanical properties vary greatly and depend on the form the carbon takes in the alloy.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1074/&gt;

"White" cast irons contain their carbon in the form of [[cementite]], or iron carbide (Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C).&lt;ref name=Greenwood1074/&gt; This hard, brittle compound dominates the mechanical properties of white cast irons, rendering them hard, but unresistant to shock. The broken surface of a white cast iron is full of fine facets of the broken iron-carbide, a very pale, silvery, shiny material, hence the appellation. Cooling a mixture of iron with 0.8% carbon slowly below 723&amp;nbsp;°C to room temperature results in separate, alternating layers of cementite and α-iron, which is soft and malleable and is called [[pearlite]] for its appearance. Rapid cooling, on the other hand, does not allow time for this separation and creates hard and brittle [[martensite]]. The steel can then be tempered by reheating to a temperature in between, changing the proportions of pearlite and martensite. The end product below 0.8% carbon content is a pearlite-αFe mixture, and that above 0.8% carbon content is a pearlite-cementite mixture.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1074/&gt;

In [[gray iron]] the carbon exists as separate, fine flakes of [[graphite]], and also renders the material brittle due to the sharp edged flakes of graphite that produce [[stress concentration]] sites within the material.&lt;ref name=Hashemi&gt;{{Citation | last = Smith | first = William F. | last2 = Hashemi | first2 = Javad | title = Foundations of Materials Science and Engineering | edition = 4th | year = 2006 | publisher = McGraw-Hill | isbn = 0-07-295358-6 | postscript =. |page=431}}&lt;/ref&gt; A newer variant of gray iron, referred to as [[ductile iron]], is specially treated with trace amounts of [[magnesium]] to alter the shape of graphite to spheroids, or nodules, reducing the stress concentrations and vastly increasing the toughness and strength of the material.&lt;ref name=Hashemi/&gt;

[[Wrought iron]] contains less than 0.25% carbon but large amounts of slag that give it a fibrous characteristic.&lt;ref name="msts" /&gt; It is a tough, malleable product, but not as fusible as pig iron. If honed to an edge, it loses it quickly. Wrought iron is characterized by the presence of fine fibers of [[slag]] entrapped within the metal. Wrought iron is more corrosion resistant than steel. It has been almost completely replaced by [[mild steel]] for traditional "wrought iron" products and [[blacksmith]]ing.

Mild steel corrodes more readily than wrought iron, but is cheaper and more widely available. [[Carbon steel]] contains 2.0% carbon or less,&lt;ref name="kts"&gt;{{cite web|title = Classification of Carbon and Low-Alloy Steels|url = http://www.keytometals.com/page.aspx?ID=CheckArticle&amp;site=kts&amp;NM=62|accessdate = 5 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; with small amounts of [[manganese]], [[sulfur]], [[phosphorus]], and silicon. [[Alloy steel]]s contain varying amounts of carbon as well as other metals, such as [[chromium]], [[vanadium]], [[molybdenum]], nickel, [[tungsten]], etc. Their alloy content raises their cost, and so they are usually only employed for specialist uses. One common alloy steel, though, is [[stainless steel]]. Recent developments in ferrous metallurgy have produced a growing range of microalloyed steels, also termed '[[HSLA steel|HSLA]]' or high-strength, low alloy steels, containing tiny additions to produce high strengths and often spectacular toughness at minimal cost.&lt;ref name=kts/&gt;&lt;ref name="md"&gt;{{Citation|title=HSLA Steel |date=2002-11-15 |url=http://machinedesign.com/BasicsOfDesignEngineeringItem/717/65970/HSLASteel.aspx |accessdate=2008-10-11 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5mVi3a0kt?url=http://machinedesign.com/article/hsla-steel-1115 |archivedate= 3 January 2010 |postscript=. |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Oberg |first= E.  |title= Machinery's Handbook |journal= New York: Industrial Press  |edition= 25th |year= 1996 |publisher= Industrial Press Inc|display-authors=etal |pages=440–2|bibcode= 1984msh..book.....R  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ironattenuation.PNG|thumb|alt=A graph of attenuation coefficient vs. energy between 1&amp;nbsp;meV and 100&amp;nbsp;keV for several photon scattering mechanisms.|[[Photon]] [[mass attenuation coefficient]] for iron.]]
Apart from traditional applications, iron is also used for protection from ionizing radiation. Although it is lighter than another traditional protection material, [[lead]], it is much stronger mechanically. The attenuation of radiation as a function of energy is shown in the graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slac.stanford.edu/cgi-wrap/getdoc/slac-pub-13033.pdf |title=Radiation Shielding at High-Energy Electron and Proton Accelerators |last1=Rokni |first1=Sayed H. |last2=Cossairt |first2=J.

The main disadvantage of iron and steel is that pure iron, and most of its alloys, suffer badly from [[rust]] if not protected in some way, a cost amounting to over 1% of the world's economy.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1076/&gt; [[Paint]]ing, [[galvanization]], [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation]], plastic coating and [[bluing (steel)|bluing]] are all used to protect iron from rust by excluding [[water]] and oxygen or by [[cathodic protection]]. The mechanism of the rusting of iron is as follows:&lt;ref name=Greenwood1076&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1076&lt;/ref&gt;

:Cathode: 3 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 12 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → 12 OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

The electrolyte is usually [[iron(II) sulfate]] in urban areas (formed when atmospheric [[sulfur dioxide]] attacks iron), and salt particles in the atmosphere in seaside areas.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1076/&gt;

===Iron compounds===
Although the dominant use of iron is in metallurgy, iron compounds are also pervasive in industry. Iron catalysts are traditionally used in the [[Haber-Bosch process]] for the production of ammonia and the [[Fischer-Tropsch process]] for conversion of carbon monoxide to [[hydrocarbon]]s for fuels and lubricants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Surface science: foundations of catalysis and nanoscience|first = Kurt W.|last = Kolasinski|isbn = 978-0-471-49244-3| publisher =John Wiley and Sons|date = 2002|url={{Google books|OA7L1l6oHAYC|page=PR15|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|chapter = Where are Heterogenous Reactions Important|pages = 15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Powdered iron in an acidic solvent was used in the [[Bechamp reduction]] the reduction of [[nitrobenzene]] to [[aniline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| url={{Google books|BiywGdlot9kC|page=PA167|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|chapter = Nitrobenzene and Nitrotoluene |isbn = 978-0-8247-2481-8|publisher = CRC Press|date = 1989|first = John J.|last = McKetta|title = Encyclopedia of Chemical Processing and Design: Volume 31 – Natural Gas Liquids and Natural Gasoline to Offshore Process Piping: High Performance Alloys|pages = 166–167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Iron(II) sulfate]] is used as a precursor to other iron compounds. It is also used to [[redox|reduce]] chromate in cement. It is used to fortify foods and treat [[iron deficiency anemia]]. [[Iron(III) sulfate]] is used in settling minute sewage particles in tank water. [[Iron(II) chloride]] is used as a reducing flocculating agent, in the formation of iron complexes and magnetic iron oxides, and as a reducing agent in organic synthesis.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

Iron acquisition poses a problem for aerobic organisms because ferric iron is poorly soluble near neutral pH. Thus, these organisms have developed means to absorb iron as complexes, sometimes taking up ferrous iron before oxidising it back to ferric iron.&lt;ref name=lpi/&gt; In particular, bacteria have evolved very high-affinity [[wikt:sequester|sequestering]] agents called [[siderophore]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| url = http://www.jbc.org/content/270/45/26723.short|pmid = 7592901|doi = 10.1074/jbc.270.45.26723|date = 1995|last1 = Neilands|first1 = J.

Hemoglobin is an oxygen carrier that occurs in [[red blood cell]]s and contributes their color, transporting oxygen in the arteries from the lungs to the muscles where it is transferred to [[myoglobin]], which stores it until it is needed for the metabolic oxidation of [[glucose]], generating energy.&lt;ref name=lpi/&gt; Here the hemoglobin binds to [[carbon dioxide]], produced when glucose is oxidized, which is transported through the veins by hemoglobin (predominantly as [[bicarbonate]] anions) back to the lungs where it is exhaled.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1098/&gt; In hemoglobin, the iron is in one of four [[heme]] groups and has six possible coordination sites; four are occupied by nitrogen atoms in a [[porphyrin]] ring, the fifth by an [[imidazole]] nitrogen in a [[histidine]] residue of one of the protein chains attached to the heme group, and the sixth is reserved for the oxygen molecule it can reversibly bind to.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1098/&gt; When hemoglobin is not attached to oxygen (and is then called deoxyhemoglobin), the Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion at the center of the [[heme]] group (in the hydrophobic protein interior) is in a high-spin configuration. It is thus too large to fit inside the porphyrin ring, which bends instead into a dome with the Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion about 55&amp;nbsp;picometers above it. In this configuration, the sixth coordination site reserved for the oxygen is blocked by another histidine residue.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1098/&gt;

When deoxyhemoglobin picks up an oxygen molecule, this histidine residue moves away and returns once the oxygen is securely attached to form a [[hydrogen bond]] with it. This results in the Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion switching to a low-spin configuration, resulting in a 20% decrease in ionic radius so that now it can fit into the porphyrin ring, which becomes planar.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1098/&gt; (Additionally, this hydrogen bonding results in the tilting of the oxygen molecule, resulting in a Fe–O–O bond angle of around 120° that avoids the formation of Fe–O–Fe or Fe–O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–Fe bridges that would lead to electron transfer, the oxidation of Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, and the destruction of hemoglobin.) This results in a movement of all the protein chains that leads to the other subunits of hemoglobin changing shape to a form with larger oxygen affinity. Thus, when deoxyhemoglobin takes up oxygen, its affinity for more oxygen increases, and vice versa.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1098/&gt; Myoglobin, on the other hand, contains only one heme group and hence this cooperative effect cannot occur. Thus, while hemoglobin is almost saturated with oxygen in the high partial pressures of oxygen found in the lungs, its affinity for oxygen is much lower than that of myoglobin, which oxygenates even at low partial pressures of oxygen found in muscle tissue.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1098/&gt; As described by the [[Bohr effect]] (named after [[Christian Bohr]], the father of [[Niels Bohr]]), the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin diminishes in the presence of carbon dioxide.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1098/&gt;

[[Carbon monoxide]] and [[phosphorus trifluoride]] are poisonous to humans because they bind to hemoglobin similarly to oxygen, but with much more strength, so that oxygen can no longer be transported throughout the body. Hemoglobin bound to carbon monoxide is known as [[carboxyhemoglobin]]. This effect also plays a minor role in the toxicity of [[cyanide]], but there the major effect is by far its interference with the proper functioning of the electron transport protein cytochrome a.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1098/&gt; The cytochrome proteins also involve heme groups and are involved in the metabolic oxidation of glucose by oxygen. The sixth coordination site is then occupied by either another imidazole nitrogen or a [[methionine]] sulfur, so that these proteins are largely inert to oxygen – with the exception of cytochrome a, which bonds directly to oxygen and thus is very easily poisoned by cyanide.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1098/&gt; Here, the electron transfer takes place as the iron remains in low spin but changes between the +2 and +3 oxidation states. Since the reduction potential of each step is slightly greater than the previous one, the energy is released step-by-step and can thus be stored in [[adenosine triphosphate]]. Cytochrome a is slightly distinct, as it occurs at the mitochondrial membrane, binds directly to oxygen, and transports protons as well as electrons, as follows:&lt;ref name=Greenwood1098/&gt;

:4 Cytc&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 8H{{su|p=+|b=inside}} → 4 Cytc&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 4H{{su|p=+|b=outside}}

Although the heme proteins are the most important class of iron-containing proteins, the [[iron-sulfur protein]]s are also very important, being involved in electron transfer, which is possible since iron can exist stably in either the +2 or +3 oxidation states. These have one, two, four, or eight iron atoms that are each approximately tetrahedrally coordinated to four sulfur atoms; because of this tetrahedral coordination, they always have high-spin iron. The simplest of such compounds is [[rubredoxin]], which has only one iron atom coordinated to four sulfur atoms from [[cysteine]] residues in the surrounding peptide chains. Another important class of iron-sulfur proteins is the [[ferredoxin]]s, which have multiple iron atoms. Transferrin does not belong to either of these classes.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1098/&gt;

The ability of sea [[mussel]]s to maintain their grip on rocks in the ocean is facilitated by their use of [[organometallic chemistry|organometallic]] iron-based bonds in their protein-rich [[cuticle]]s. Based on synthetic replicas, the presence of iron in these structures increased [[elastic modulus]] 770 times, [[tensile strength]] 58 times, and [[toughness]] 92 times. The amount of stress required to permanently damage them increased 76 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first = K| last = Sanderson|title = Mussels' iron grip inspires strong and stretchy polymer| journal = Chemical &amp; Engineering News|page=8|volume = 95| issue = 44| publisher = American Chemical Society| date = 2017| url=https://cen.acs.org/articles/95/i44/Mussels-iron-grip-inspires-strong-stretchy-polymer.html|accessdate=2 November 2017| doi=10.1021/cen-09544-notw3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health and diet===
Iron is pervasive, but particularly rich sources of dietary iron include [[red meat]], [[oyster]]s, [[lentil]]s, [[bean]]s, [[poultry]], [[fish]], [[leaf vegetable]]s, [[watercress]], [[tofu]], [[chickpea]]s, [[black-eyed peas]], and [[blackstrap molasses]].&lt;ref name=lpi/&gt; [[Bread]] and [[breakfast cereal]]s are sometimes specifically fortified with iron.&lt;ref name=lpi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eatwell.gov.uk/healthissues/irondeficiency/ Food Standards Agency – Eat well, be well – Iron deficiency] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060808184739/http://www.eatwell.gov.uk/healthissues/irondeficiency/ |date=8 August 2006 }}.

Iron provided by [[dietary supplement]]s is often found as [[iron(II) fumarate]], although [[iron(II) sulfate]] is cheaper and is absorbed equally well.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt; Elemental iron, or reduced iron, despite being absorbed at only one-third to two-thirds the efficiency (relative to iron sulfate),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoppe|first1=M.|last2=Hulthén|first2=L.|last3=Hallberg|first3=L.|title=The relative bioavailability in humans of elemental iron powders for use in food fortification|journal=European Journal of Nutrition|volume=45|issue=1|pages=37–44|date=2005|pmid=15864409|doi=10.1007/s00394-005-0560-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; is often added to foods such as breakfast cereals or enriched wheat flour.

===Dietary recommendations===
The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for iron in 2001.&lt;ref name=lpi/&gt; The current EAR for iron for women ages 14–18 is 7.9&amp;nbsp;mg/day, 8.1 for ages 19–50 and 5.0 thereafter (post menopause). For men the EAR is 6.0&amp;nbsp;mg/day for ages 19 and up. The RDA is 15.0&amp;nbsp;mg/day for women ages 15–18, 18.0 for 19–50 and 8.0 thereafter. For men, 8.0&amp;nbsp;mg/day for ages 19 and up. RDAs are higher than EARs so as to identify amounts that will cover people with higher than average requirements. RDA for pregnancy is 27&amp;nbsp;mg/day and, for lactation, 9&amp;nbsp;mg/day.&lt;ref name=lpi/&gt; For children ages 1–3 years 7&amp;nbsp;mg/day, 10 for ages 4–8 and 8 for ages 9–13. As for safety, the IOM also sets [[Tolerable upper intake level]]s (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of iron the UL is set at 45&amp;nbsp;mg/day. Collectively the EARs, RDAs and ULs are referred to as [[Dietary Reference Intake]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Iron|url=https://www.nal.usda.gov/sites/default/files/fnic_uploads//290-393_150.pdf |title=Dietary Reference Intakes for Vitamin A, Vitamin K, Arsenic, Boron, Chromium, Copper, Iodine, Iron, Manganese, Molybdenum, Nickel, Silicon, Vanadium, and Iron|publisher= National Academy Press|year= 2001|pages= 290–393|pmid=25057538|isbn= 0-309-07279-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL defined the same as in United States. For women the PRI is 13&amp;nbsp;mg/day ages 15–17 years, 16&amp;nbsp;mg/day for women ages 18 and up who are premenopausal and 11&amp;nbsp;mg/day postmenopausal. For pregnancy and lactation, 16&amp;nbsp;mg/day. For men the PRI is 11&amp;nbsp;mg/day ages 15 and older. For children ages 1 to 14 the PRI increases from 7 to 11&amp;nbsp;mg/day. The PRIs are higher than the U.S. RDAs, with the exception of pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Overview on Dietary Reference Values for the EU population as derived by the EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies| year = 2017| url = https://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/assets/DRV_Summary_tables_jan_17.pdf|work=European Food Safety Authority}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EFSA reviewed the same safety question did not establish a UL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Tolerable Upper Intake Levels For Vitamins And Minerals| publisher = European Food Safety Authority| year = 2006| url = http://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/efsa_rep/blobserver_assets/ndatolerableuil.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV). For iron labeling purposes 100% of the Daily Value was 18&amp;nbsp;mg, and {{as of|2016|May|27|lc=y|df=US}} remained unchanged at 18&amp;nbsp;mg.&lt;ref name="FedReg"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-05-27/pdf/2016-11867.pdf |title=Federal Register May 27, 2016 Food Labeling: Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels.

The original deadline to be in compliance was July 28, 2018, but on September 29, 2017 the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] released a proposed rule that extended the deadline to January 1, 2020 for large companies and January 1, 2021 for small companies.&lt;ref name="FDAdelay"&gt;[https://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/LabelingNutrition/ucm385663.htm#dates "Changes to the Nutrition Facts Panel – Compliance Date"].

===Excess===
{{Main|Iron overload}}
[[Human iron metabolism|Iron uptake]] is tightly regulated by the human body, which has no regulated physiological means of excreting iron. Only small amounts of iron are lost daily due to mucosal and skin epithelial cell sloughing, so control of iron levels is primarily accomplished by regulating uptake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ramzi S.

Overdoses of ingested iron can cause excessive levels of free iron in the blood. High blood levels of free ferrous iron react with [[peroxide]]s to produce highly reactive [[free radical]]s that can damage [[DNA]], [[proteins]], [[lipids]], and other cellular components. Iron toxicity occurs when the cell contains free iron, which generally occurs when iron levels exceed the availability of [[transferrin]] to bind the iron. Damage to the cells of the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]] can also prevent them from regulating iron absorption, leading to further increases in blood levels. Iron typically damages cells in the [[heart]], [[liver]] and elsewhere, causing adverse effects that include [[coma]], [[metabolic acidosis]], [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]], [[liver failure]], [[coagulopathy]], [[adult respiratory distress syndrome]], long-term organ damage, and even death.&lt;ref name="Cheney" /&gt; Humans experience iron toxicity when the iron exceeds 20&amp;nbsp;milligrams for every kilogram of body mass; 60&amp;nbsp;milligrams per kilogram is considered a [[lethal dose]].&lt;ref name="emed-topic285"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emedicine.com/emerg/topic285.htm|title=Toxicity, Iron

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3073">The [http://www.jsee.org.jm '''Jamaica Society of Energy Engineers''' ](JSEE) is a newly formed public [[non-profit organization]] with a mandate to promote the conscientious utilization of [[energy]] resources in [[Jamaica]]. The JSEE formation was initially spurred by the need for a professional entity to provide and oversee local training and [[certification]] of Energy Auditors and Managers.
The JSEE is now a chapter&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aeecenter.org/Chapters/ AEE Jamaica Chapter]&lt;/ref&gt; of the Association of Energy Engineers (AEE),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aeecenter.org Association of Energy Engineers]/&lt;/ref&gt; which is the world-wide certifying body for all [[Certified Energy Manager|energy engineers]].

==Formation==
The formation of the society was spearheaded by the Computing and Engineering Entrepreneurial Centre,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utech.edu.jm/CEEC/index.htm Computing and Engineering Entrepreneurial Centre]&lt;/ref&gt; at the University of Technology (UTech) and was officially launched&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utech.edu.jm/News_Events/VOL13_ISS2.html Jamaica Society of Energy Engineers Launched at UTech]&lt;/ref&gt; at the Technology Innovation Centre, UTech on February 27, 2009.

The society's objectives are to promote energy matters in organizations, corporate with industries and organizations to provide energy solutions, certify energy professionals and provide career guidance for students at the secondary and tertiary levels.

==Background==
As part of the [[Government of Jamaica]]’s (GOJ) expressed desire to promote the implementation of [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] and conservation practices, the GOJ through the Development Bank of Jamaica (DBJ) made available J$1 Billion to be lent to Small and Medium Size Enterprises (SME’s).  The Project named the “DBJ-PetroCaribe Energy Line of Credit for SME”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbankjm.com/files/fliers/Energy%203.5x8.pdf DBJ-PetroCaribe Energy Line of Credit for SMEs ''retrieved on September 18, 2009'']&lt;/ref&gt; will be distributed by Approved Financial Institutions (AFIs) (Commercial Banks, Credit Unions and P.C. Banks) to SME members after completing an Energy Audit done by an approved Auditor from the [[Petroleum Corporation of Jamaica]].

The [[University of Technology, Jamaica]] was invited to be a partner in the project to establish the Jamaica Society of Energy Engineers and to train persons as Certified Energy Managers &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aeecenter.org/certification/CEMpage.htm Certified Energy Managers]&lt;/ref&gt; expected to do the audits on the SME. The other members of the partnership are Development Bank of Jamaica (DBJ),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbankjm.com Development Bank of Jamaica]&lt;/ref&gt; Jamaica Trade and Invest (JTI),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamaicatradeandinvest.org/ Jamaica Trade and Invest]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Petroleum Corporation of Jamaica]] (PCJ).

In operation, it is higher than case temperature and the temperature of the part's exterior. The difference is equal to the amount of heat transferred from the junction to case multiplied by the junction-to-case [[thermal resistance]].

==Microscopic effects==

Various physical properties of semiconductor materials are temperature dependent. These include the diffusion rate of [[dopant]] elements, [[Electron mobility|carrier mobilities]] and the thermal production of [[charge carrier]]s.

At the low end, sensor diode noise can be reduced by cryogenic cooling. On the high end, the resulting increase in local power dissipation can lead to [[thermal runaway]] that may cause momentary or permanent device failure.

==Maximum junction temperature calculation==

'''Maximum junction temperature''' (sometimes abbreviated '''TJMax''') is specified in a part's datasheet and is used when calculating the necessary case-to-ambient thermal resistance for a given power dissipation. This in turn is used to select an appropriate [[heat sink]] if necessary. Other cooling methods include [[thermoelectric cooling]] and [[Coolant]]s.

In modern processors from manufacturer such as [[Intel]], [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]], [[Qualcomm]] , the core temperature is measured by a sensor. If the core reaches its TJMax, this will trigger a protection mechanism to cool the processor. If the temperature rises above the TJMax, the processor will trigger an alarm to warn the computer operator who can then discontinue the process that is causing the overheating or shut down the computer to prevent damage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/hwmon/coretemp Rudolf Marek, "Datasheet: Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures", ''Software Developer's Manual'' Vol.3A: System Programming Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;

An estimation of the chip-junction temperature, T&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;, can be obtained from the following equation:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Thermal and Power Management of Integrated Circuits|series=Integrated Circuits and Systems|last1=Vassighi|first1=Arman|last2=Sachdev|first2=Manoj|date=2006|isbn=9780387257624}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- page 32 --&gt;

T&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt; = T&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; + ( R &lt;sub&gt;θJA&lt;/sub&gt; × P&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; )...

where:
T&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; = ambient temperature for the package ( °C )

R &lt;sub&gt;θJA&lt;/sub&gt; = junction to ambient thermal resistance ( °C / W )

P&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; = power dissipation in package (W)

== Measuring junction temperature (Tj) ==
Many semiconductors and their surrounding optics are small, making it difficult to measure junction temperature with direct methods such as [[Thermocouple|thermocouples]] and [[Thermographic camera|infrared cameras]]. 

Junction temperature may be measured indirectly using the device's inherent voltage/temperature dependency characteristic. Combined with a [[JEDEC|Joint Electron Device Engineering Council (JEDEC)]] technique such as JESD 51-1 and JESD 51-51, this method will produce accurate Tj measurements. However, this measurement technique is difficult to implement in multi-LED [[Series and parallel circuits|series circuits]] due to high common mode voltages and the need for fast, high [[duty cycle]] current pulses. This difficulty can be overcome by combining high-speed sampling digital multimeters and fast high-compliance pulsed [[Current source|current sources]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vektrex.com/news-articles/measuring-led-junction-temperature-tj/|title=Measuring LED Junction Temperature (Tj) - Vektrex|date=2017-01-06|work=Vektrex|access-date=2017-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once junction temperature is known, another important parameter, [[Thermal resistance|thermal resistance (Rθ)]], may be calculated using the following equation:

&lt;code&gt;Rθ = ΔT/(V&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;*I&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;

=== Junction temperature of LEDs and laser diodes ===
An [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] or [[Laser diode|laser diode’s]] junction temperature (Tj) is a primary determinate for long-term reliability; it also is a key factor for [[Photometry (optics)|photometry]]. For example, a typical white LED output declines 20% for a 50 °C rise in junction temperature. Because of this temperature sensitivity, LED measurement standards, like [[Illuminating Engineering Society of North America|IESNA]]’s [https://www.ies.org/store/measurement-testing/electrical-and-photometric-measurements-of-high-power-leds/ LM-85], require that the junction temperature is determined when making photometric measurements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vektrex.com/solutions/thermal-measurements/|title=Thermal Measurements Products &amp; Solutions - Vektrex|work=Vektrex|access-date=2017-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Junction heating can be minimized in these devices by using the Continuous Pulse Test Method specified in LM-85. An L-I sweep conducted with an [[Osram Opto Semiconductors GmbH|Osram]] Yellow LED shows that Single Pulse Test Method measurements yield a 25% drop in [[luminous flux]] output and [[Direct current|DC]] Test Method measurements yield a 70% drop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vektrex.com/3-steps-improved-led-light-measurements-accuracy/|title=3 Steps to Improved LED Light Measurements: Accuracy - Vektrex|work=Vektrex|access-date=2017-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kaiser (K) is a [[unit of energy]].  A common form is '''kiloKaiser''' (kK).  1 kK = 1000&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.  ( cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, [[wavenumber]] or inverse [[wavelength]].)  This unit is most commonly used with respect to energy transitions between electronic states in inorganic complexes.

==See also==
*[[Wavenumber]]

Kilokaiser is a common but incorrect spelling of the unit KiloKayser, which equals 1000 wavenumber (cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;).  The unit is named after [[Heinrich Gustav Johannes Kayser]] (16 March 1853 – 14 October 1940), a German physicist.

'''Leading and lagging current''' are phenomena that occur as a result of [[alternating current]]. In a circuit with alternating current, the value of voltage and current vary sinusoidally. In these types of circuits, the terms lead, lag, or in phase are used to describe current with reference to voltage. Current is in phase with voltage when there is no [[phase shift]] between the sinusoids describing their time varying behavior. This generally occurs when the load drawing the current is resistive.

In electric power flow, it is important to know whether current is leading or lagging because it can be used to describe how much circulating [[reactive power]] flow is occurring in the system, and whether that power is inductive or capacitive. It can also play an important role in the operation of three-phase power systems.

==Angle notation==
[[Angle notation]] can easily describe leading and lagging current:

&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;A \angle \theta.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nilsson p. 338&lt;/ref&gt;

In this equation, the value of theta is the important factor for leading and lagging current. As mentioned in the introduction above, leading or lagging current represents a time shift between the current and voltage sine curves, which is represented by the angle by which the curve is ahead or behind of where it would be initially. For example, if θ is zero, the curve will have amplitude zero at time zero.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Electric Power Systems: A Conceptual Introduction|last = von Meier|first = Alexandra|publisher = [[Wiley-Interscience]]|year = 2006|isbn = |location = |pages = 49–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using [[complex number]]s is a way to simplify analyzing certain components in [[RLC circuits]]. For example, it is very easy to convert these between polar and rectangular coordinates. Starting from the polar notation, &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\angle \theta &lt;/math&gt; can represent either the [[Euclidean vector|vector]] &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;(\cos \theta, \sin \theta)\,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; or the rectangular notation &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\cos \theta + j \sin \theta = e^{j\theta},\,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; both of which have magnitudes of 1.

==Lagging current==
&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;A \angle \theta =A \angle \delta - (\beta)&lt;/math&gt;

Lagging current can be formally defined as “an alternating current that reaches its maximum value up to 90 degrees later than the voltage that produces it.” This means that current lags the voltage when &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, the angle of the current sine wave with respect to an arbitrarily chosen reference, is less than &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;, the angle of the voltage sine wave with respect to the same reference. Therefore, current can quickly be identified as lagging if the angle &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is positive. For example, if the voltage angle &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is zero, current will be lagging if &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is negative. This is often the case because voltage is taken as the reference.

In circuits with primarily inductive loads, current lags the voltage. This happens because in an inductive load, it is the induced electromotive force that causes the current to flow. Note that in the definition above, the current is produced by the voltage. The induced electromotive force is caused by a change in the magnetic flux linking the coils of an inductor.

==Leading current==

&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;A \angle \theta =A \angle \delta - (\beta)&lt;/math&gt;

Leading current can be formally defined as “an alternating current that reaches its maximum value up to 90 degrees ahead of the voltage that it produces.” This means that the current leads the voltage when &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, the angle of the current sine wave with respect to an arbitrarily chosen reference is greater than &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;, the angle of the voltage sine wave with respect to the same reference. Therefore, current can quickly be identified as leading if the angle &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is negative. For example, if the voltage angle &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is zero, current will be leading if &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is positive. This is often the case because voltage is taken as the reference.

In circuits with primarily capacitive loads, current leads the voltage. This is true because current must first flow to the two plates of the capacitor, where charge is stored. Only after charge accumulates at the plates of a capacitor is a voltage difference established. The behavior of the voltage is thus dependent on the behavior current and on how much charge accumulates. This is why the formal definition states that the current produces the voltage.

==Visualizing leading and lagging current==
A simple [[phasor]] diagram with a two dimensional [[Cartesian coordinate]] system and phasors can be used to visualize leading and lagging current at a fixed moment in time. In the real-complex coordinate system, one
period of a sine wave corresponds to a full circle in the complex plane. Since
the voltage and current have the same frequency, at any moment in time those
quantities can be easily represented by stationary points on the circle, while
the arrows from the center of circle to those points are called phasors. Since
the relative time difference between functions is constant, they also have a
constant angle difference between them, represented by the angle between points
on the circle. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Historical documents regarding leading and lagging currents==
An early source of data is an article from the 1911 [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] by A.E. Kennelly.  Kennelly uses traditional methods in solving vector diagrams for oscillating circuits, which can also include alternating current circuits as well.

The origin of desert glass is uncertain. [[Meteor]]itic origins have long been considered possible, and recent research links the [[glass]] to impact features, such as [[zircon]]-breakdown, vaporized [[quartz]] and meteoritic metals, and to an [[impact crater]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wits.ac.za/newsroom/newsitems/201310/21649/news_item_21649.html |title=First ever evidence of a comet striking Earth |publisher=Wits University |author1=Jan Kramers |author2=David Block |author3=Marco Andreoli |year=2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010235550/http://www.wits.ac.za/newsroom/newsitems/201310/21649/news_item_21649.html |archivedate=2013-10-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kramers, J.D et al (2013): Unique chemistry of a diamond-bearing pebble from the Libyan Desert Glass strewnfield, SW Egypt: Evidence for a shocked comet fragment.

Intense [[tropical cyclone]]s usually produce [[tornado]]es, the majority of those weak, especially upon [[Landfall (meteorology)|landfall]].

== List of tornadoes ==
These are the tropical cyclones that are known to have spawned tornadoes. The list is most complete for the U.S., but does include other areas. Within the United States 1,163 tornadoes were associated with tropical cyclones,&lt;ref name="SPC tor list"&gt;{{cite web |last = Edwards |first = Roger |authorlink= Roger Edwards (meteorologist) |title = Tropical cyclone tornado data set |publisher = Storm Prediction Center |url = http://www.spc.noaa.gov/misc/edwards/TCTOR/tctor.xls |format = xls |accessdate = 2012-01-24 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- http://www.spc.noaa.gov/misc/edwards/TCTOR/readme.txt --&gt; accounting for slightly under 6% of all tornadoes. The most tornadoes spawned by a single tropical cyclone were associated with [[Hurricane Ivan]], which spawned 120 tornadoes.

The '''Marduk-apal-iddina II kudurru''' is a boundary stone ([[kudurru]]) of [[Marduk-apal-iddina II]], who ruled [[Babylon]] from 722 BC - 710 BC.

Some kudurrus are known for their representations of the king, etc, who consigned the production. Most kudurrus represent [[Mesopotamia]]n gods, which are often displayed graphically in segmented ''[[Register (sculpture)|register]]s'' on the stone.

Marduk-apal-iddina's kudurru contains one register at the stones upper section. A series of gods are represented.

{{Wiktionary| Nacelle}}
A '''nacelle''' {{IPAc-en|n|ə|ˈ|s|ɛ|l}} is a cover [[Enclosure (electrical)|housing]] that houses all of the generating components in a [[wind turbine]], including the [[Electric generator|generator]], [[gearbox]], [[drive train]], and brake assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energy.gov/eere/wind/how-do-wind-turbines-work|title=How Wind Turbines Work|date=30 November 2006|publisher=US Department of Energy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable feature now found on some [[Wind_farm#Offshore_installations|off-shore wind turbines]] is a large sturdy helicopter-hoisting platform built on top of the nacelle, capable of supporting service personnel and their tools, winched down to the platform from a helicopter hovering above it.&lt;ref&gt;Eize de Vries. [http://www.windpowermonthly.com/news/1140792/Close---Alstom-Haliade-6MW-prototype/ Close up: Alstom Haliade 6MW Prototype], ''Windpower Monthly'', 11 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Wind turbine rotors are stopped, feathered and locked before personnel are dropped down to or picked up from the platforms.

'''Northern Powergrid Holdings Company''' (formerly '''CE Electric UK Funding Company''') is an [[electrical distribution]] company based in [[Newcastle Upon Tyne]] in England. It is the owner of '''Northern Powergrid (Northeast) Limited''' (formerly '''Northern Electric Distribution Limited''' ('''NEDL''')) and '''Northern Powergrid (Yorkshire) plc''' (formerly '''Yorkshire Electricity Distribution plc''' ('''YEDL''')) which are the [[Distribution Network Operator]]s for the North East England and Yorkshire regions.

==History==
The company was created after the takeover of [[Northern Electric]] by [[Berkshire Hathaway Energy|CalEnergy]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/northern-electric-sparks-pounds-650m-us-bid-1360778.html Northern Electric sparks £650m US bid] The Independent, 29 October 1996&lt;/ref&gt; The company disposed of the supply business of Northern Electric to [[Innogy plc]] in 2001 in exchange for the distribution business of [[Yorkshire Electricity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pepei.pennnet.com/articles/article_display.cfm?article_id=119189 Innogy, Northern in retail swap] Power Engineering International, September 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus it represents the electricity distribution systems of the former [[North Eastern Electricity Board]] and [[Yorkshire Electricity Board]], which were privatised in 1990.

==Network==
Northern Powergrid is an electricity distribution business, delivering electricity on behalf of suppliers from the national transmission system to 3.9 million domestic and business customers.

Covering an area of 25,000 square kilometres, Northern Powergrid’s network extends from north Northumberland, south to the Humber and northern Lincolnshire, and from the east coast to the Pennines. The network consists of more than 63,000 substations and around 96,000 kilometres of overhead line and underground cables.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.northernpowergrid.com/about-us&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ownership and structure==
Northern Powergrid is a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Berkshire Hathaway Energy]].

On 1 November 2011 Northern Powergrid was rebranded from CE Electric UK. The new name is intended to give a better customer representation of the business, its location and operations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.northernpowergrid.com/news/we_have_a_new_name.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''nutrition scale''' is a [[Weighing scale|weighing instrument]] that output precise [[nutritional information]] for foods or liquids. Most scales calculate [[calorie]]s, [[carbohydrate]]s, and [[fat]]s, with more sophisticated scales calculating additional nutrients such as [[Vitamin K]], [[potassium]], [[magnesium]], and [[sodium]].

Scales often use [[USDA]] information on food to ensure accuracy. The products are used primarily as a [[weight management]] tool, but have found a user base with [[Diabetes|diabetics]] and [[Hypertension|hypertensive]] people.

An '''oxygen bar''' is an establishment, or part of one, that sells [[oxygen]] for recreational use. Individual flavored scents may be added to enhance the experience. The flavors in an oxygen bar come from bubbling oxygen through bottles containing aromatic solutions before it reaches the nostrils: most bars use food-grade particles to produce the scent, but some bars use aroma oils.&lt;ref&gt;Drahl, Carmen. "The Highs and Lows of Oxygen." Chemical and Engineering News 86.45 (2008):64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dispositif de distribution d'oxygène parfumé aux huiles essentielles à usage unique ou multiple pouvant prendre la forme de bars, de fontaines ou de narguilés - Brevet d'invention N° 07 04583 - INPI (France)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1776, [[Thomas Henry (apothecary)|Thomas Henry]], an apothecary and [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] of England speculated [[tongue in cheek]] that [[Joseph Priestley]]’s newly discovered [[dephlogisticated air]] (now called oxygen) might become “as fashionable as French wine at the fashionable taverns”.  He did not expect, however, that tavern goers would “relish calling for a bottle of Air, instead of [[Claret]]” &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=clEJAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=%22dephlogisticated%20air%22%20patent&amp;pg=PA215&amp;output=embed Thomas Henry F. R. S. “Essays Physical and Chemical by M. Lavoisier – Translated from the French, with Notes, and an Appendix, by Thomas Henry”, note from The London Review of English and Foreign Literature by W. Kenrick, Vol IV, T. Evans, Pater-Noster-Row, 1776, p 214]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another early reference to the recreational use of oxygen is found in [[Jules Verne]]'s 1870 novel ''[[Around the Moon]]''. In this work Verne states
"Do you know, my friends, that a curious establishment might be founded with rooms of oxygen, where people whose system is weakened could for a few hours live a more active life.  Fancy parties where the room was saturated with this heroic fluid, theaters where it should be kept at high pressure; what passion in the souls of the actors and spectators! what fire, what enthusiasm!  And if, instead of an assembly only a whole people could be saturated, what activity in its functions, what a supplement to life it would derive. From an exhausted nation they might make a great and strong one, and I know more than one state in old Europe which ought to put itself under the regime of oxygen for the sake of its health!"

Modeled after the "air stations" in polluted downtown Tokyo and Beijing, the first official oxygen bar (the O2 Spa Bar) opened in Toronto, Canada, in 1996. The trend continued in North America and by the late 1990s bars were in use in New York, California, Florida, Las Vegas and the Rocky Mountain region. Customers in these bars breathe oxygen through a plastic hose inserted into their nostrils.&lt;ref&gt;Altman, Nathaniel. The Oxygen Prescription: The Miracle of Oxidative Therapies. Rochester: Healing, 2007. 313–14&lt;/ref&gt;  Oxygen bars can now be found in many venues such as nightclubs, salons, spas, health clubs, resorts, tanning salons, restaurants, coffee houses, bars, airports, ski chalets, yoga studios, chiropractors, and casinos. They can also be found at trade shows, conventions and corporate meetings, as well as at private parties and promotional events.

==Provision of oxygen==

Oxygen bar guests pay about one [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]] per minute to inhale a percentage of oxygen greater than the normal atmospheric content of 20.9% oxygen. This oxygen is produced from the ambient air by an industrial (non-medical) [[oxygen concentrator]] and inhaled through a [[nasal cannula]] for up to about 20 minutes.&lt;ref name="FDA" /&gt;

The machines used by oxygen bars or oxygen vendors differ from the typical medical-issue machine, although customers use the cannula, the rubber tube apparatus that fits around the ears and inserts in the nostrils, to breathe in the oxygen. Customers can enhance their experience by using aromatherapy scents to be added to the oxygen, such as lavender or mint.&lt;ref&gt;Stalling, Ann E., "A breath of fresher air." Ball State Daily News. 27 Feb. 2004:1. http://www.bsudailynews.com/home/search/  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619205117/http://www.bsudailynews.com/home/search/ |date=June 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health benefit claims==
It has been claimed by [[alternative medicine]] that the human body is oxygen-deprived, and that oxygen will remove "toxins" and even cure cancer.&lt;ref name="LiveScience"&gt;[[Christopher Wanjek|Wanjek, Christopher]]. "Suffocating Trends: Oxygen Bars and Drinks." LiveScience (2006): 1. 25 June 2009. http://www.livescience.com/health/060418_bad_oxygen.html&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents claim this practice is not only safe, but enhances health and well-being, including strengthening the [[immune system]], enhancing concentration, reducing stress, increasing energy and alertness, lessening the effects of hangovers, headaches, and sinus problems, and generally relaxing the body.&lt;ref name="FDA" /&gt; It has also been alleged to help with altitude sickness.  However, no long-term, well-controlled scientific studies have confirmed any of the proponents' claims.&lt;ref name="FDA" /&gt;  Furthermore, the human body is adapted to 21 percent oxygen, and the blood exiting the lungs already has about 97 percent of the oxygen that it could carry bound to [[hemoglobin]]. Having a higher oxygen fraction in the lungs serves no purpose, and may actually be detrimental.&lt;ref name="LiveScience"/&gt;

The medical profession warns that individuals with respiratory diseases such as [[asthma]] and [[emphysema]] should not inhale too much oxygen.&lt;ref name="FDA"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/oxygenbars.html  |title=Oxygen Bars: Is a Breath of Fresh Air Worth It? |last=Bren |first=Linda |date=November 2002 |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration (in FDA Consumer magazine) |accessdate=2018-03-14 | pmid=12523293}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Higher than normal oxygen [[partial pressure]] can also indirectly cause [[carbon dioxide narcosis]] in patients with [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Patel, Dharmeshkumar N |author2=Goel, Ashish |author3=Agarwal, SB |author4=Garg, Praveenkumar |author5=Lakhani, Krishna K |date=July 2003 |title=Oxygen toxicity |journal=Journal, Indian Academy of Clinical Medicine |volume=4 |issue=3| pages=234&amp;ndash;7| url=http://medind.nic.in/jac/t03/i3/jact03i3p234.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[FDA]] warns that in some situations, droplets of flavoring oil can be inhaled, which may contribute to an inflammation of the [[lungs]]. Some oxygen bar companies offer safe water-based aromas for flavoring in order to maintain compliance and stay within FDA guidelines.&lt;ref name="FDA" /&gt;

Oxygen may also cause serious side effects at excessive doses. Although the effects of [[oxygen toxicity]] at atmospheric pressure can cause lung damage,&lt;ref name="pmid4948324"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Clark, John M |author2=Lambertsen, Christian J |title=Pulmonary oxygen toxicity: a review |journal=Pharmacological Reviews |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=37–133 |year=1971 |pmid=4948324 |url=http://pharmrev.aspetjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=4948324 |accessdate=2008-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
the low fraction of oxygen (30&amp;ndash;40%)&lt;ref&gt;"Oxygen Delivery Methods." American Thoracic Society. http://www.thoracic.org/clinical/copd-guidelines/for-health-professionals/exacerbation/inpatient-oxygen-therapy/oxygen-delivery-methods.php Accessed 9 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and relatively brief exposures make pulmonary toxicity unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=O'Keefe, Michael F|title=Brady emergency care |publisher=Brady/Prentice Hall |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |date=c. 1998 |chapter=6 Oxygen Therapy |isbn=0-8359-5073-5|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, due caution should be exercised when consuming oxygen. In the UK, the Health and Safety Executive publishes guidance on equipment (including tubing) and on staff training, as well as warning on potential hazards, and makes several recommendations to ensure safe practice, principally to minimise fire risks.&lt;ref name="HSE200805"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/foi/internalops/td_din/other-gas/td5_057.htm |title=Review of developments in the use of oxygen |last=Gregson |first=Margaret |date=May 2008 |publisher=UK Health and Safety Executive (HSE) |accessdate=2012-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another concern is the improper maintenance of oxygen equipment.  Some oxygen concentrators use clay filters which cause micro-organisms to grow, creating an additional danger that can cause lung infections.&lt;ref&gt;Chavis, Vicki F., "Oxygen Bars - Health Benefit or Hazard." Natural Medicine 9 Apr. 2009: 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, concentrated oxygen is a flame accelerant which should be kept away from cigarettes and other sources of ignition.

==Regulations==

In the United States, the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] defines any substance used for breathing and administered by another person as a prescription drug.
Melvin Szymanski, a consumer safety officer in the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration's]] (FDA) Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, has explained that at one end of the hose is a source of oxygen, so the individual providing the hose and turning on the supply is dispensing a prescription drug.&lt;ref name="enotalone"&gt;{{cite web |author=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |title=Oxygen Bars: Healthy or Just Hype |publisher=enotalone.com. |date=28 June 2009 |url=http://www.enotalone.com/article/8882.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206192823/http://www.enotalone.com/article/8882.html |archivedate=6 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He commented that "Although oxygen bars that dispense oxygen without a prescription violate FDA regulations, the agency applies regulatory discretion to permit the individual state boards of licensing to enforce the requirements pertaining to the dispensing of oxygen."&lt;ref name="enotalone"/&gt;

Canadian Society of Respiratory Therapists says that "As health professionals, we cannot ethically or morally support providing oxygen therapy to those who do not require it."&lt;ref&gt;Sorgen, Carol. "The Rise of Oxygen Bars." WebMD (2002):1-2. http://www.webmd.com/balance/features/rise-of-oxygen-bars&lt;/ref&gt;

== Website ==
reegle is a search engine specifically covering [[renewable energy]], [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] and [[climate change]] issues. It was conceived as a public resource for governments, project developers, banks and finance institutions, [[NGO]]s, and international organisations as well as the general public.

In addition to its search function, the site has a news feed provided courtesy of EnviroFinland, a blog, a green glossary of terms and event listings.

It has three main search components.

=== Web search ===
The central function of the site is a web search, which offers a "[[mind map]]" based search refinement function.

=== Map search ===
The user can click on a map of the world and get information on renewable energy and energy efficiency in that specific country, including relevant government ministries, private companies, country energy statistics, and a sampling of clean energy development projects in that specific area.

=== Renewable Energy and Climate Glossary ===
An online glossary covering about 4000 terms from the clean energy and climate sector, with definition from Open Data sources. Translations of many terms into additional languages is also available.

The '''Renewable Energy Certificate System''' (RECS) was a voluntary system for international trade in renewable [[energy certificate]]s that was created by [[RECS International]] to stimulate international development of renewable energy. It advocated the use of a standard [[energy certificate]] to provide evidence of the production of a quantity of renewable energy, and provided a methodology which enables renewable energy trade, enabling the creation of a market for renewable energy and so promoting the development of new renewable energy capacity in Europe.

A RECS [[energy certificate]] was issued for every 1 megawatt-hour (MWh) of renewable energy produced by an electricity generation facility that was registered with the relevant national RECS issuing body. These certificates could be transferred between market parties in different countries, and were used to provide evidence of the consumption of renewable energy – at which point they were made non-transferable, in order to ensure that the "renewable benefit" was not double-sold.

While RECS guaranteed the source of the energy and prevented double-counting, it was not a label: these also guarantee other matters relating to the supplied electricity, such as the originating technology, the age of the plant and the source of the energy. Labels must also ensure that sales of labelled electricity either do not change the blend of sources of electricity that is supplied unlabelled, or that the buyers of such electricity are informed accordingly.

The market for RECS certificates was administered by the [[Association of Issuing Bodies]] (AIB) according to its [[European Energy Certificate System]] (EECS), in the same way as the obligatory guarantees of origin required by the various European Union Directives that have now replaced voluntary RECS certificates in Europe.

== Limits of RECS ==
Several non-governmental environmental organizations like [[Greenpeace]] and the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] claimed that in practice there was no ecological benefit ensured by this certification method alone.&lt;ref&gt;From Green Energy to Waste Subsidy: A Greenpeace position paper on green electricity http://www.greenpeace.org/belgium/Global/belgium/report/2000/12/from-green-energy-to-waste-sub-2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; While the demand for this certification method did not exceed supply by renewable energy power plants which had already existed for decades, it was criticized as being a pure mind-game: in practice, the amount of renewable source electricity that was assigned to certificate buyers was just "assigned away" from the other power consumers; and in total, nothing had changed. Indeed, some electricity traders misuse RECS certificates that they bought from old renewable source electricity power plants that had existed for years to imply misleadingly that buying their "RECS certified regenerative electricity" made a change to the environment.

== Safeguards against misuse ==
Reputable eco-friendly electricity labels ensure an ecological benefit in practice. Some reputable labels (like the WWF co-funded German "ok-power" label) also used RECS, but only as a broadly-accepted accounting and tracking system (to register the power plants against double-selling); other labels required direct contracts for delivery with the plant as an alternative. The crux of such efforts was to additionally insist that the certificate-selling or directly-contracted power plant met important eco-orientated standards; those standards typically encompassing a maximum age of the power plant (to ensure that new power plants are built) and the banning of power plants that act against landscape or animal protection. Other labels co-issued by environmental organizations required that a part of the fee of every kWh be donated for investment in new eco-friendly power plants or technology.&lt;ref&gt;[Green Power Labelling - An Instrument to enhance Transparency and Sustainability on the Voluntary Green Power Market, Öko-institute e.V, 2007, http://www.oeko.de/oekodoc/1480/2007-230-en.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, certified REC seller Arcadia Power bought certificates exclusively from projects located within the same [[ISO RTO|ISO/RTO]] grid as the purchaser and which were produced within five years of sale. Primarily catering to residences and small businesses, the company provided customers with details about the wind or solar farm where their RECS certificates were generated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arcadia Power: How It Works|url=http://arcadiapower.com/how-it-works/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Rue du Bœuf''' is a 188-metre [[cobbled street|cobbled pedestrian street]] of the [[Vieux Lyon]] quarter, located in the [[5th arrondissement of Lyon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rues de Lyon à travers les siècles |first=Maurice |last=Vanario |publisher=ELAH |place=Lyon |year=2002 |language=French |isbn=2-84147-126-8 |page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Very representative of the Renaissance architecture of the neighborhood, it is lined only with old houses from the 16th or 17th century. The street connects the [[rue de Gadagne]] which it continues after the Place du Petit Collège and the intersection of the rue du Chemin Neuf, the rue de la Bombarde and the rue Tramassac which prolongs it.&lt;ref name="Valette"&gt;{{cite book |title=Lyon et ses rues |last=Brun De La Valette |first=Robert |publisher=Le Fleuve |place=Paris |year=1969 |language=French |page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The street belongs to the zone classified as [[World Heritage Site]] by UNESCO.

[[File:Cour de la Tour Rose.JPG|thumb|Courtyard of the Tour Rose.]]
The rue du Bœuf, like the rue Saint-Jean, was created to the late 3rd century after the inhabitants of [[Fourvière]], the upper town of Lugdunum, were deprived of water and forced to descend to the [[Saône]] to gradually build a whole neighborhood, where is the current Vieux Lyon. The street was once inhabited by wealthy merchants of Lyon,&lt;ref name="Gilbert"&gt;{{cite book |title=L'histoire des rues de Lyon |first=Gilbert |last=Bouchard |year=2000 |publisher=Glénat |place=Grenoble |language=French |isbn=2-7234-3442-7 |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the rue Saint-Jean, and was formerly part of the rue Tramassac&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Voyage pittoresque et historique à Lyon, aux environs et sur les rives de la Saône et du Rhône |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_TwoAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA378 |first=François Marie |last=De Fortis |year=1822 |volume=2 |pages=378–79 |language=French |accessdate=31 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which it extends, and had this name before 1586. There was a [[Mint (coin)|Mint]] in the street, which was transferred to the Hôtel du Grollier in 1590.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Revue du Lyonnaise |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g9xdAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA8 |volume=4 |year=1836 |page=8 |accessdate=31 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 16th century, when a statue of [[cattle]] was carved, located in the niche that is at the corner of the Place Neuve Saint Jean, the street received its current name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rue du Bœuf |url=http://ruesdelyon.wysiup.net/PageRubrique.php?ID=1004265&amp;rubID=1004485 |publisher=Rues de Lyon |language=French |accessdate=6 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statue was first attributed to Jean de Bologne, then to Martin Hendricy, from [[Liège]], who went in Lyon circa 1640.&lt;ref name="Valette"/&gt; In 1650, the street was extended at north to the rue Gadagne, providing better traffic in the area, drawing a parallel to the rue Saint-Jean. In 1722, it was enlarged on the side of the rue du Chemin Neuf. On 18 February 1822, at 8:45 am, several houses in the street were shattered by an earthquake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Histoire de Lyon depuis les Gaulois jusqu’à nos jours, ornée de vignettes, points de vue et portraits |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ml64k3Il6UC&amp;pg=PA538 |first=C. |last=Beaulieu |publisher=A.

[[File:Sawmill Kalomo.jpg|thumb|A saw pit in use near [[Kalomo]], Zambia, in 2007]]
A '''saw pit''' or '''sawpit&lt;!--REDIRECT--&gt;''' is a pit over which lumber is positioned to be sawed with a long two-handled [[saw]] by two people, one standing above the timber and the other below.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/sawpit "sawpit"] and [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/saw+pit "saw pit"] at [[TheFreeDictionary.com]]&lt;/ref&gt; It was used for producing sawn planks from tree trunks, which could then be cut down into boards, [[Fence|pales]], posts, etc. Many towns, villages and country estates had their own saw pits. The greatest user of sawn timber in past centuries was the shipbuilding industry.

== Sawing ==

[[File:Zrywka drewna w Masywie Śnieżnika PL.jpg|thumb|Large logs would be usually hauled to the site by horses.]]

A [[Sawyer (occupation)|sawyer]] is a person who cuts ("saws") wood for a living.  Sawyers were at one time important members of the rural community, because many implements, as well as buildings, were made of wood. In [[England]], the terms used were 'bottom sawyer', for the man standing in the pit, and 'top sawyer', for the man who balanced on the log.

Together, the sawyers would alternate pulling the [[two-man saw]] through the log. If the saw [[wikt:kerf|kerf]] began closing, it could cause the saw to bind and increase friction; wedges, most often made of convenient bits of wood, could be inserted in order to keep the kerf open and reduce the friction. "Kerf" is an Anglo-Saxon word related to our modern day word 'carve'.&lt;ref name="Kerf"&gt;[http://www.uh.edu/engines/epi845.htm The word Kerf]&lt;/ref&gt; Two-man saws were designed to cut in both directions and very careful tooth design was necessary to clear the sawdust during the cut. The sawdust accumulated to the extent that it had to be 'dug out' and removed in a bucket. Oak dust could be burned and used in the curing of bacon.&lt;ref name="Wheelwright"&gt;Sturt, George (1963). ''The Wheelwright's Shop.''. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-09195-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Two man saw.JPG|thumb|left|180px|A small two-handled [[crosscut saw]], not a pit saw which is a [[rip saw]].]]

The two man team would use a two handled saw, called a '[[whipsaw]]', with 'saddleblocks' or 'dogs' to hold the log in position horizontally. Sawing was a slow and exhausting process, requiring strong men with great stamina. The topsawyer had to be especially strong because the saw was pulled in turn by each man, and the lower had the advantage of gravity. The topsawyer also had the important task of guiding the saw so that the board was of even thickness. This was often done by following a chalkline. In some cases the box handle on one end of the saw could be removed so the saw could be pulled free when the sawyers needed to move the timber to a new position.&lt;ref name="Woodcraft"&gt;[http://alpha1.fmarion.edu/htc/Exhibits/AfricanAmericanLife/P122.HTM A detachable end to the saw.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The top-sawyer's work had to be very accurate; it was he who kept a careful balance on the log and guided the long saw, who kept the cuts straight or curved as required, and who estimated the width of the planks. He was the man in charge of the operation, and it wasn't uncommon for nicknames such as 'William Top-sawyer' to be common currency in country areas.&lt;ref name="Sawyer2"&gt;[http://www.therhondda.co.uk/personalities/david_davies.html Memoirs of Country life.]&lt;/ref&gt; Great pride was taken in the finished article, and anticipation of the end result tended to ease the exertion of the labour required.

Saw pits were a crucial component of shipbuilding, for which planks of wood were necessary for the construction of all classes of vessels. The logs of wood to be sawn were placed over a pit on planks of wood called "dogs" in naval jargon. The senior sawyer stood on top of the plank. The junior one had to go into the pit, which was often partially filled with water, with sawdust constantly 'raining down,' so he stood in a layer of sawdust as a result.&lt;ref name="Sawpit"&gt;[http://www.torbytes.co.uk/op/gorounds/goround1335.htm Brixham Museum model]&lt;/ref&gt; One theory of the origin of the terms 'top dog' and 'underdog' is that they come from saw pit work practices (however, others cite documentary evidence that these terms more likely arose from dog fighting).&lt;ref name="Topdog"&gt;[http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/top-dog.html Dog fighting and the origin of Topdog, etc.]&lt;/ref&gt; Cutting from underneath a suspended log is sometimes called "underbucking".

Ten foot logs were sometimes sawn into boards except for about the last two inches. In this way the boards could be more easily handled; then the boards were separated by cutting off the end of the log.&lt;ref name="Sawing"&gt;[http://homepages.tesco.net/~George_Garner/aug97.htm Number of boards cut in a day.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Up to 200 boards a day could be produced with water-driven power sawing, compared to the 12 or so a day by two men in a saw pit. A saw pit could, if circumstances demanded, be worked by a single person, the end of the saw being weighted with a stone or some other weight, and then raised and lowered by the sawyer.&lt;ref&gt;Paterson, Page 105&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the saw pit ==

[[File:Timber DonnellyMills2005 SeanMcClean.jpg|thumb|250px|Tree trunks ready for sawing.]]

A very early water driven Roman sawmill was in use in [[Hierapolis]], the [[Hierapolis sawmill]]. [[Sawmill]]s may well have been developed in the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] period, as one was sketched by [[Villard de Honnecourt]] in c. 1250.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, Pages 643 - 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  There are claims that they were introduced to [[Madeira]] following its discovery in c. 1420 and spread widely in Europe in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, Pages 84-5.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The 'modern' sawmill was invented or perfected by the Dutchman [[Cornelis Corneliszoon]] (1550–1607) who applied a [[pitman arm]] onto a wind mill, which converted a turning motion into an up-an-down sawing motion. Cornelis took out a patent on his sawmill on December 15, 1593, and on the pitman arm device on December 6, 1597.  Early sawmills adapted the [[wikt:whipsaw|whipsaw]] to mechanical power, generally driven by a [[water wheel]]. The circular motion of the wheel was changed to back-and-forth motion of the saw blade by the ''pitman'' arm or rod. A pitman is similar to a crankshaft, but in reverse (a crankshaft converts back-and-forth motion to circular motion).

Several early sawmills in England were burned by sawyers who were fearful of losing their livelihoods. However, the increased efficiency of the sawmill, and the back-breaking nature of the saw pit work, resulted in saw pits generally going out of use in the United Kingdom at the time of the industrial revolution. Old [[Ordnance survey|OS maps]] circa 1860 often show the location of saw pits, but by the start of the 20th century very few remained and most are no longer in use. [[Roy Underhill]] tells the tall tale, or tongue-in-cheek story, that, after the development of steam-powered sawing machines, saw pits were unnecessary, and therefore were cut up and sold as post-holes.

==The Royal Dockyards==
Saw pits were introduced into the Royal Dockyards in the mid 18th century. Before their introduction, trestles were used to support the log, and a frame saw employed for the cutting. In the Royal Dockyards saw pits, the upper sawyer was called the 'Topman;' he followed the marked line to make a straight plank, and the 'Underman' pushed the rib, pit or whip saw. The logs were held firmly in place by 'G' shaped clamps called 'dogs' that were hammered into the log being cut. The pits were usually lined with elm wood, which withstood damp. Access to the saw pit was via steps or a ladder at one end. The sawyers were paid by the 100 foot runs, with pay related to the difficulty of sawing the wood, oak being the highest paid. Usually the sawyer was responsible for sharpening the saws, however on occasion a whet man was employed to do that work.&lt;ref&gt;Dodds and Moore, Page 46&lt;/ref&gt;

== Around the world ==

===Australia===
Saw pits provided much of the sawn timber for Australia during the 1800s. Convicts were put to work in saw pits as a punishment in [[penal colony|penal colonies]] in [[Tasmania]].&lt;ref name="IronSteelTimberAU"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dargavel|first1=John|title=Iron, steel and timber: a transient heritage|url=https://www.ipenz.org.nz/heritage/conference2007/papers/Dargavel_J_Paper_Final.pdf|accessdate=20 May 2018|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saw pits also featured in some of the most significant events of early european Australian settlement. In August 1788, [[William Bligh]] captain of the [[HMS Bounty]], anchored in [[Adventure Bay, Tasmania]] and ordered his crew to dig a saw pit in order to repair their boat. Eight months later the crew would go on to [[mutiny]] in the famous [[Mutiny on the Bounty]].&lt;ref name="MutinyOnTheBounty"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bligh|first1=William|title=Mutiny on the Bounty|date=2012|publisher=Dover Publications Inc|location=New York|isbn=978-0-486-47257-7|page=51|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0486121895|accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1789, the first British fleet sailed into [[Botany Bay]], then [[Sydney Cove]] to settle [[Sydney]]. Saw pits were promptly dug in both places so building timber could be produced.&lt;ref name="MillingAustraliaForests"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Evans|first1=Peter|title=Milling Australia’s forests|url=http://www.environmentalhistory-au-nz.org/links/publications/anzfh/anzfh1evans.pdf|publisher=The Australian &amp; New Zealand Environmental History Network|accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
Saw pits were prominent in the early european logging of New Zealand. Even with the introduction of water powered sawmills in the 1840s, and steam powered sawmills in 1865, saw pits were still being used in the early 1900s in difficult locations.&lt;ref name="LoggingNativeForestsNZ"&gt;{{cite web|title='Logging native forests - Logging and sawmilling, 1840–1920|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/logging-native-forests/page-4|publisher=Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=20 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A pit sawyer in New Zealand was well paid. For instance during the 1840s in Nelson a sawyer could earn 80 pounds in five months, more than double the average wage.&lt;ref name="TreetoTimberNZ"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Isaacs|first1=Nigel|title=Tree to timber|url=https://www.buildmagazine.org.nz/assets/PDF/B114-98-Building-History.pdf|publisher=Build Magazine (BRANZ)|accessdate=20 May 2018|date=October-November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Micro history ==
The saw pit at [[Llanerchaeron|Llanaeron Home Farm]] is unusually housed in a single-story open-fronted building. The rear wall is of rubble (stone) construction and there is a rubble pier at each of the front corners, with the whole structure under a pitched slate roof.

[[Q-pit]]s, used to make [[White coal]], are often found nearby saw pits.&lt;ref name="Muir"&gt;Muir, Pages 91 - 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Shakespeare]] refers to saw pits in the ''Merry Wives of Windsor''.&lt;ref name="Topdog" /&gt; Daniel Defoe's character, the 17th century castaway Robinson Crusoe, complains about how difficult it is to saw timber into planks without the use of a saw pit. 

Philip Wharton was born in 1613, and at the age of 12 (1625) he became the fourth [[Lord Wharton]]. In 1642 Lord Wharton raised a regiment of foot soldiers and a troop of horsemen to fight in the [[Battle of Edgehill]]. They behaved less than gloriously - "Before there were any near excuse three or four of our regiments fairly ran away - Sir William Fairfax's, Sir Henry Cholmley's, my Lord Kimbolton's and to say the plain truth my own." Wharton himself ran away and is said to have hidden in a saw pit, thus earning for himself the parliamentary nickname of Philip 'Sawpit' Wharton.&lt;ref name="Wharton"&gt;[http://gmb.orpheusweb.co.uk/lowrow/tglw.html Sawpit Wharton.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The settlement of Saw Pit in the United States of America eventually outgrew this name and became [[Port Chester]] by incorporating as a village in 1868. The Town of [[Sawpit, Colorado]]  is a [[statutory town]] located in [[San Miguel County, Colorado|San Miguel County]], Colorado, United States of America.

'''Tractor vaporising oil''' (or '''TVO''') is a fuel for [[petrol-paraffin engine]]s. In the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Australia]], after the [[Second World War]], it was commonly used for [[tractor]]s until [[diesel engine]]s became commonplace. In [[Australian English]] it was known as '''power kerosene'''.

==History==
TVO existed for at least fifteen years before it became widely used. A 1920 publication mentions it as a product of [[BP|British Petroleum]].&lt;ref name=""&gt;{{Citation |author=Editorial staff |year=1920 |title=News column |work=[[Commercial Motor|The Commercial Motor]] |volume=31 |publisher=Temple Press Limited |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8IXnAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22tractor+vaporizing+oil%22&amp;dq=%22tractor+vaporizing+oil%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7zEOVP_OI8fI8gGzw4CYDw&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAQ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; But it was not until the late 1930s that it first became widely used. The [[Aftermath of World War II|post war]] [[Ferguson TE20]] tractor, a carefully researched and near-ideal tractor for use on British farms, was designed around a [[petrol]] (gasoline) engine, the [[Standard inline-four engine|Standard inline-four]]. Although there was a campaign for the reintroduction of agricultural Road Duty (tax)-free petrol, which had been curtailed during the war, this was not forthcoming. [[Perkins Engines]] supplied some conversions into diesel engines which could use untaxed [[red diesel]].

On the early [[Fordson]] model N, the tap which changed over from petrol to TVO was marked G for gasoline and K for kerosene, reflecting that these tractors had their design origin in the USA. In the UK tractor vaporising oil was usually called TVO.

==Octane rating==
As a substitute for petrol, TVO was developed. Paraffin (kerosene) was commonly used as a domestic heating fuel and was untaxed. Paraffin has a low [[octane rating]] and would damage an engine built for petrol. The manufacture of paraffin involves the removal of [[aromatic hydrocarbon]]s from what is now sold as [[heating oil]]. These aromatics have an octane rating, so adding some of that otherwise waste product material back in a controlled manner into paraffin gave TVO. The resulting octane rating of TVO was somewhere between 55 and 70.

The words paraffin and kerosene are often used interchangeably but the tables suggest that this is incorrect because they have different [[octane rating]]s. However, kerosene and [[heating oil]] have similar octane ratings. Paraffin, kerosene and petrol ([[gasoline]]) are all rather loosely defined. For example, gasoline may have an octane rating between 88 and 102.

==Engine modifications==

===Compression ratio===
Because TVO has a lower [[octane rating]] than petrol, the engine needs a lower [[compression ratio]]. On the TVO version of the Ferguson TE20 tractor, the [[cylinder head]] was re-designed to reduce the compression ratio to 4.5:1.  This reduced the power output, so the [[cylinder bore]] was increased to 85&amp;nbsp;mm to restore the power.&lt;ref name="archive1"/&gt; The [[Standard wet liner inline-four engine|petrol version]] had a compression ratio of 5.77:1 and a cylinder bore of 80&amp;nbsp;mm on early versions..

===Vaporiser===
In practice TVO had most of the properties of paraffin, including the need for heating to encourage vapourisation. As a result, the [[exhaust manifold|exhaust]] and [[inlet manifold]]s were adapted so that more heat from the former warmed the latter. Such a setup was called a [[carburetor#Vaporizers|vaporiser]]. To get the tractor to start from cold, a small second fuel tank was added that contained petrol. The tractor was started on the expensive petrol, then – once the engine was warm – the fuel supply switched over to TVO or paraffin. So long as the engine was working hard, as when [[plough]]ing or pulling a load, the TVO would burn well. Under light conditions, such as travelling unloaded on the highway, the engine was better on petrol.

===Radiator blind===
Some tractor designs included a [[radiator]] "blind" that would restrict the flow of air over the radiator which led to the engine running hotter, which could help with starting. If the radiator blind was left shut, though, there was a risk of engine damage, especially in warm weather.

==Terminology==
The phrase [[petrol-paraffin engine]] is often used to describe an engine that uses TVO. This can be interpreted either as 
:*the use of the two fuels, starting on petrol then switching to the paraffin-based TVO
:*the use of a mixture of petrol and paraffin as a substitute for the proper TVO

==Supply==
TVO was withdrawn from sale by UK suppliers in 1974 but has been re-introduced by at least one supplier (Rye Oil Ltd). An approximation to the correct specification can be made from [[petrol]] and [[heating oil]] (burning oil).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fofh.co.uk/tech/tvo.htm |title=Friends of Ferguson Heritage Ltd.- TVO Recipes |publisher=Fofh.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK there is an exception that permits the use of rebated kerosene and fuel oils in vintage vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/hcotegmanual/HCOTEG12780.htm |title=HCOTEG12780 |publisher=Hmrc.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8491">Tskaltubo is located in the central part of west Georgia, in the lowland, at the foot of the Southern Caucasus, 98 meters above the sea-level, in the valley of the river Tskaltubo. It is in 9 km distance from Kutaisi and 240km from Tbilisi.The climate in Tskaltubo is warm and moderately mild. Average annual temperature +150C; average annual precipitation 76%. Winters here are warm and mild.
The  “Waters of Immortality” in Tskaltubo were probably known already in the 7th-9th centuries, when the oldest historical records are dated. Since the 18th century several foreign researchers gave word of the healing properties of these springs:Berlin Society of Friends of Natural Science (1782); J.Klaproth (1815); A. Jolenberg (1897). By 1920, after chemical analysis had revealed the uniqueness of the water, Tskaltubo was officially declared a medical spa resort and  achieve the status of city in 1953.

In 1920 the territory of Tskaltubo became state property and it acquired the function of balneology resort. The building of the resort started in 1926. In 1931, a decree by the government of Georgian Soviet Republic designed Tskaltubo as a spa resort and balneology center.

In 1950-1951, architects I.Zaalishvili and V.Kedia prepared a project plan for the town where sanatoriums form a circle around a park, recreation and balneology facilities. Tskaltubo was divided into the following zones: balneological, sanitarian and living.

In 1953, Tskaltubo became the important spa-resort during the Soviet times. At different times, there were built 19 sanatoriums and pensions, nine baths, resort park, Branch of Scientific Institute of balneology and physiotherapy.
As one of Georgia's flagship historic spa towns, the town is still popular for the qualities of its waters. Tskaltubo mineral waters are famous for their stable physical and chemical composition and they are categorized as slight radon chloride –magnesium waters. The high-performance spa preventive effect of mineral waters is conditioned by their complex content and particular fusion of salt components. In Tskaltubo the bath taking has a peculiar technique, the treatment take place under the constant running water ( mineral water constantly flows in and out of the spa) and the water permanently preserves physical-chemical and mineral compositions. The water consists of six components and it penetrates into the human body via pores. Constituent ingredients in number are far below the permissible minimum, '''temperature of water is 33-35 C, it  is very soft, pure and odorless.''' 

Tskaltubo Mineral water cures the following disease: limbs, peripheral nervous system, cardiac and vascular, skin, disbalance, endocrinology system, gynecological , rheumatism, poliomyelitis, cerebral palsy. Waters are recommended for adults and children (over 3) as well. 

The Tskaltubo Balneological Zone is located in the lowland part of the town, in this part is a beautiful park (78ha) and a bathroom complex. Just here is the deposit of Tskaltubo springs where from the bathes are supplied with water. The park is the island located in the heart of the town. The park with its planning, plant, engineering art works (bridges, irrigation systems) is the unique cultural monument that provides an inimitable appearance of the town. The perennial and rare species, evergreen decorative plants, flowers grown in the park and subtropical climate create a pleasant climate in the town.
Another significant factor in Tskaltubo is its architecture which is basically a synthesis of Stalinist period classical style and of Georgian ethnic decor with Gothic and Roman features.

'''The unique radon-carbonated waters are Tskaltubo's major mineral resource.'''

They emerge at a comfortable temperature for bathing (35C), allowing them to be directly transferred from springs to the baths without cooling or heating.

These exclusive water are used to relieve a number of conditions including skin, metabolic, and circulatory diseases. It effectiveness make them useful to treat up to 60 conditions! 
The '''Spring №6''', is the largest thermal bath working today. It was built in 1950 exclusively for Joseph Vissarionovich Jughashvili (Stalin), the soviet union leader of the period. Private baths and dachas of Stalin and Lavrenti Beria are still kept in the city. The mineral water flows directly into  Buildings #1 and #6. These medical and rehabilitation centers are equipped with modern, European production and medical equipment. There are five pools of mineral water, 37 individual cabins for bathing mineral water, 17 hydro-massage cabinets, horizontal stretch cabinet of the spine, etc.. They offer treatment for osteochondrosis, ankylosing spondylitis, stature disorder, rheumatoid polyarthritis, spondyloarthritis, urologic and andrologic diseases, gynecological and skin diseases, etc. 

In 2015 the new medical thermal center '''Tskaltubo-BE Healthy''' was established, equipped with the latest technologies and modern infrastructures. The center is notable for its wide offer of services available in its calm and comfortable environment. It offers treatments with healing waters and various health procedures. For example: Skin –restorative procedures, Body Fitness, Spa and Wellness body massage, Wellness hydrotherapy procedures , Application of mineral mud ( Peleoidoterapy ) , Diode laser , Gym  and many other health-improving practices.

Tskaltubo is rich with karst caves. Such as “Satsurblia" "Prometheus", "Sataplia" which  provides visitors with breathtaking examples of stalactites, stalagmites, curtains, petrified waterfalls, cave pearls, underground rivers, and lakes.  The temperature in the cave is always 13-15C 

'''[[Satsurblia cave]]''' is the first and only Speleotherapic  - object in the Caucasus Region. The  cave has unique climatic environment that gives it the ability be transformed to a recreational tourism destination for individuals with respiratory diseases ( e.g. Bronchial asthma, etc.)  As for Speleotherapy, or underground climate-therapy it is a set of recreational therapy methods based on the use of underground microclimate to improve health.

'''[[Prometheus Cave Natural Monument|Prometheus cave]]''' is one of the most beautiful and longest caves in Georgia. Visitors can see amazing halls of Argonauts, Colchis,  Medea, Love, and Prometheus and of  Iberia, the excursion can be finished by foot or by a 15 minute boat ride an underground river .

'''Sataplia reserve''' is famous its footprints of herbivore and carnivore dinosaurs. The reserve also has a karst caves. There is a transparent platform that gives an outstanding view of Imereti’s landscape beauty.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13150">Original models of wind turbines were fixed speed turbines; that is, the rotor speed was a constant for all wind speeds. The tip-speed ratio for a wind turbine is given by the following formula:

&lt;math&gt;
\lambda = \frac{\omega R}{v}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the rotor speed (in radians per second), &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the length of a blade, and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the wind speed. That is to say, for a fixed-speed wind turbine, the value of the tip-speed ratio is only changed by wind speed variations. In reference to a &lt;math&gt;C_p&lt;/math&gt;-&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; graph, which illustrates the relationship between [[Tip-speed ratio]] and efficiency, it is evident that only one value of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; yields the highest efficiency. That is, the fixed speed wind turbine is not operating at peak efficiency across a range of wind speeds. This was a motivator for the development of variable speed wind turbines.

== Background ==

Before the need to connect wind turbines to the grid, turbines were variable speed. This was not a problem because turbines did not have to be synchronized with the frequency of the grid.&lt;ref name="carlin" /&gt;

All grid-connected wind turbines, from the first one in 1939 until the development of variable-speed grid-connected wind turbines in the 1970s, were fixed-speed wind turbines.
As of 2003, nearly all grid-connected wind turbines operate at exactly constant speed (synchronous generators) or within a few percent of constant speed (induction generators).&lt;ref name="carlin"&gt;

=== Cp-λ curves ===

Below is an illustration of the &lt;math&gt;C_p - \lambda&lt;/math&gt; curve for a typical wind turbine.

[[File:Cplambdadiagram.jpg|500px|center]]

Maximum efficiency occurs at one tip-speed ratio only. Since tip-speed ratio is given by the aforementioned expression, variable speed wind turbines can operate at maximum efficiency over all wind speeds (ideally).

=== Torque Rotor-speed diagrams ===

For a wind turbine, the power harvested is given by the following formula:

&lt;math&gt;
P = \frac{1}{2}\rho\pi R^2 v^3 \times C_P
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the power, &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the density of the air, &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the length of the blade, &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the wind, and &lt;math&gt;C_p&lt;/math&gt; is the power co-efficient for the wind turbine. The power co-efficient is a representation of how much of the available power in the wind is captured by the wind turbine.

The torque, &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, on the blades is given by the ratio of the power extracted to the rotor speed, &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;
T = \frac{P}{\omega}
&lt;/math&gt;

The rotor speed can be related to the wind speed, &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, through the tip-speed ratio, &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;
\lambda = \frac{\omega R}{v}
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus we can get the following expressions for torque and power:

&lt;math&gt;
P = \frac{1}{2\lambda^3}\rho\pi R^5 \omega^3 \times C_P
&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt;
T = \frac{1}{2\lambda^3}\rho\pi R^5 \omega^2 \times C_P = \frac{1}{2\lambda}\rho\pi R^3 v^2 \times C_P
&lt;/math&gt;

From the above equation, we can construct a torque- rotor speed diagram for a wind turbine. This consists of multiple curves: a constant power curve which plots the relationship between torque and rotor speed for constant power (green curve); constant wind speed curves, which plot the relationship between torque and rotor speed for constant wind speeds (dashed grey curves); and constant efficiency curves, which plot the relationship between torque and rotor speed for constant efficiencies, &lt;math&gt;C_p&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument/9781846284922-c1.pdf?SGWID=0-0-45-436805-p172423327&lt;/ref&gt; This diagram is presented below:

==== Notes ====

Green curve: Plot of power = rated power &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;P = \mathrm{const.} = T\omega&lt;/math&gt;

Grey curve: Wind speed, &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, is held constant &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;T \propto \omega^2\times C_p&lt;/math&gt;

Blue curve: Constant &lt;math&gt;C_p&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;T \propto \omega^2&lt;/math&gt;

== Blade forces ==

''For further details, see [[Blade Element Momentum Theory]]''

Consider the following figure:

[[File:Apparent speed seen by rotor  blade.jpg|center]]

This is the depiction of the apparent wind speed, as seen by a blade (left of figure). The apparent wind speed is influenced by both the free-stream velocity of the air, and the rotor speed. From this figure, we can see that both the angle &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and the apparent wind speed &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; are functions of the rotor speed, &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;. By extension, the lift and drag forces will also be functions of &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;. This means that the axial and tangential forces that act on the blade vary with rotor speed. The force in the axial direction is given by the following formula:

== Operating strategies for variable speed wind turbines ==

=== Stall regulated ===

As discussed earlier, a wind turbine would ideally operate at its maximum efficiency for below rated power. Once rated power has been hit, the power is limited. This is for two reasons: ratings on the drivetrain equipment, such as the generator; and second to reduce the loads on the blades. An operating strategy for a wind turbine can thus be divided into a sub-rated-power component, and a rated-power component.

==== Below rated power ====

Below rated power, the wind turbine will ideally operate in such a way that &lt;math&gt;C_p = C_{p~max}&lt;/math&gt;. On a Torque-rotor speed diagram, this looks as follows:

[[File:Stall regulated variable speed wind turbine TRS1.jpg|center|500px]]

where the black line represents the initial section of the operating strategy for a variable speed stall-regulated wind turbine.  Ideally, we would want to stay on the maximum efficiency curve until rated power is hit. However, as the rotor speed increases, the noise levels increase. To counter this, the rotor speed is not allowed to increase above a certain value. This is illustrated in the figure below:

[[File:Stall regulated variable speed wind turbine TRS2.jpg|center|500px]]

==== Rated power and above ====

Once the wind speed has reached a certain level, called rated wind speed, the turbine should not be able to produce any greater levels of power for higher wind speeds. A stall-regulated variable speed wind turbine has no pitching mechanism. However, the rotor speed is variable. The rotor speed can either be increased or decreased by an appropriately designed controller. In reference to the figure illustrated in the blade forces section, it is evident that the angle between the apparent wind speed and the plane of rotation is dependent upon the rotor speed. This angle is termed the [[angle of attack]].

The lift and drag co-efficients for an airfoil are related to the angle of attack. Specifically, for high angles of attack, an airfoil [[Stall (flight)|stalls]]. That is, the drag substantially increases. The lift and drag forces influence the power production of a wind turbine. This can be seen from an analysis of the forces acting on a blade as air interacts with the blade (see the following [[Blade Element Momentum Theory#Blade forces|link]]). Thus, forcing the airfoil to stall can result in power limiting. 

So it can be established that if the angle of attack needs to be increased to limit the power production of the wind turbine, the rotor speed must be reduced. Again, this can be seen from the figure in the blade forces section. It can also be seen from considering the torque-rotor speed diagram. In reference to the above torque-rotor speed diagram, by reducing the rotor speed at high wind speeds, the turbine enters the stall region, thus bringing some limiting to the power output.

[[File:Stall regulated variable speed wind turbine TRS.jpg|center|500px]]

=== Pitch regulated ===

Pitch regulation thus allows the wind turbine to actively change the angle of attack of the air on the blades. This is preferred over a stall-regulated wind turbine as it enables far greater control of the power output.

==== Below rated power ====

Identical to the stall-regulated variable-speed wind turbine, the initial operating strategy is to operate on the &lt;math&gt;C_{p~max}&lt;/math&gt; curve. However, due to constraints such as noise levels, this is not possible for the full range of sub-rated wind speeds. Below the rated wind speed, the following operating strategy is employed:

[[File:Stall regulated variable speed wind turbine TRS2.jpg|center|500px]]

==== Above rated power ====

Above the rated wind speed, the pitching mechanism is employed. This allows a good level of control over the angle of attack, thus control over the torque. The previous torque rotor-speed diagrams are all plots when the pitch angle, &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, is zero. A three dimensional plot can be produced which includes variations in pitch angle.

Ultimately, in the 2D plot, above rated wind speed, the turbine will operate at the point marked 'x' on the diagram below.

[[File:Pitch regulated variable speed wind turbine TRS3.jpg|center|500px]]

== Gearboxes ==

A variable speed may or may not have a gearbox, depending on the manufacturer's desires. Wind turbines without gearboxes are called direct-drive wind turbines. An advantage of a gearbox is that generators are typically designed to have the rotor rotating at a high speed within the stator. Direct drive wind turbines do not exhibit this feature. A disadvantage of a gearbox is reliability and failure rates.&lt;ref&gt;http://mragheb.com/Wind%20Power%20Gearbox%20Technologies.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a wind turbine without a gearbox is the Enercon E82.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.enercon.de/en-en/64.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Generators ==

For variable speed wind turbines, one of two types of generators can be used: a [[Doubly_fed_electric_machine#Double_fed_induction_generator|DFIG]] (doubly fed induction generator) or an [[Fully rated converter generator|FRC]] (fully rated converter). 

A DFIG generator draws [[AC_power#Reactive_power|reactive power]] from the transmission system; this can increase the vulnerability of a transmission system in the event of a failure. A DFIG configuration will require the generator to be a wound rotor;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.4thintegrationconference.com/second/downloads/Anaya%20Trans%20Tutorial%20Talk.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; squirrel cage rotors cannot be used for such a configuration.

A fully rated converter can either be an induction generator or a permanent magnet generator. Unlike the DFIG, the FRC can employ a squirrel cage rotor in the generator; an example of this is the Siemens SWT 3.6-107, which is termed the industry workhorse.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.energy.siemens.com/nl/pool/hq/power-generation/renewables/wind-power/wind%20turbines/E50001-W310-A103-V6-4A00_WS_SWT_3_6_107_US.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a permanent magnet generator is the Siemens SWT-2.3-113.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.energy.siemens.com/us/pool/hq/power-generation/wind-power/E50001-W310-A174-X-4A00_WS_SWT-2.3-113_US.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A disadvantage of a permanent magnet generator is the cost of materials that need to be included.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rechargenews.com/wind/article1292870.ece&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Grid Connections ===

Consider a variable speed wind turbine with a permanent magnet synchronous generator. The generator produces AC electricity. The frequency of the AC voltage generated by the wind turbine is a function of the speed of the rotor within the generator:

&lt;math&gt;
N = \frac{120f}{P}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the rotor speed, &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the number of poles in the generator, and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the frequency of the output Voltage. That is, as the wind speed varies, the rotor speed varies, and so the frequency of the Voltage varies. This form of electricity cannot be directly connected to a transmission system. Instead, it must be corrected such that its frequency is constant. For this, power converters are employed, which results in the de-coupling of the wind turbine from the transmission system. As more wind turbines are included in a national power system, the inertia is decreased. This means that the frequency of the transmission system is more strongly affected by the loss of a single generating unit.

==== Power converters ====

As already mentioned, the voltage generated by a variable speed wind turbine is non-grid compliant. In order to supply the transmission network with power from these turbines, the signal must be passed through a power converter, which ensures that the frequency of the voltage of the electricity being generated by the wind turbine is the frequency of the transmission system when it is transferred onto the transmission system. Power converters first convert the signal to DC, and then convert the DC signal to an AC signal. Techniques used include [[Pulse-width modulation|pulse width modulation]].
