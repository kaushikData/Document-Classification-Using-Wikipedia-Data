[[File:A Mathematician's Apology.pdf|thumb|Full text of the "A Mathematician's Apology" by G. H. Hardy.]]

'''''A Mathematician's Apology''''' is a 1940 essay by British mathematician [[G. H. Hardy]].  It concerns the [[Mathematical beauty|aesthetics of mathematics]]  with some personal content, and gives the layman an insight into the mind of a working [[mathematician]].

==Summary==
[[File:Ghhardy@72.jpg|thumb|left|In ''A Mathematician's Apology'', [[G. H. Hardy]] defined a set of criteria for mathematical beauty.]]
In the book's title, Hardy uses the word "[[Apologetics|apology]]" in the sense of a formal justification or defence (as in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology of Socrates]]''), not in the sense of a plea for forgiveness.

Hardy felt the need to justify his life's work in mathematics at this time mainly for two reasons. Firstly, at age 62, Hardy felt the approach of old age (he had survived a heart attack in 1939) and the decline of his mathematical creativity and skills.
By devoting time to writing the Apology, Hardy was admitting that his own time as a creative mathematician was finished. In his foreword to the 1967 edition of the book, [[C. P. Snow]] describes the Apology as
"a passionate lament for creative powers that used to be and that will never come again".
In Hardy's words, "Exposition, criticism, appreciation, is work for second-rate minds. [...] It is a melancholy experience for a professional mathematician to find himself writing about mathematics. The function of a mathematician is to do something, to prove new theorems, to add to mathematics, and not to talk about what he or other mathematicians have done."

Secondly, at the start of the [[World War II]], Hardy, a committed [[pacifist]], wanted to justify his belief that mathematics should be pursued for its own sake rather than for the sake of its applications. He wanted to write a book in which he would explain his mathematical philosophy to the next generation of mathematicians; that would defend mathematics by elaborating on the merits of pure mathematics solely, without having to resort to the attainments of applied mathematics in order to justify the overall importance of mathematics; and that would inspire the upcoming generations of pure mathematicians. Hardy was an [[atheist]], and makes his justification not to [[God]] but to his fellow man.

One of the main themes of the book is the beauty that mathematics possesses, which Hardy compares to painting and poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=King |first1=Jerry P. |title=The Art of Mathematics |date=1992 |publisher=Fawcett Columbine |isbn=0-449-90835-6 |pages=135–139}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For Hardy, the most beautiful mathematics was that which had no practical applications in the outside world ([[pure mathematics]]) and, in particular, his own special field of [[number theory]].  Hardy contends that if useful knowledge is defined as knowledge which is likely to contribute to the material comfort of mankind in the near future (if not right now), so that mere intellectual satisfaction is irrelevant, then the great bulk of higher mathematics is useless.  He justifies the pursuit of pure mathematics with the argument that its very "uselessness" on the whole meant that it could not be misused to cause harm.  On the other hand, Hardy denigrates much of the [[applied mathematics]] as either being "trivial", "ugly", or  "dull", and contrasts it with "real mathematics", which is how he ranks the higher, pure mathematics.

Hardy expounds by commenting about a phrase attributed to [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] that "Mathematics is the queen of the sciences and number theory is the queen of mathematics." Some people believe that it is the extreme non-applicability of number theory that led Gauss to the above statement about number theory; however, Hardy points out that this is certainly not the reason. If an application of number theory were to be found, then certainly no one would try to dethrone the "queen of mathematics" because of that. What [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] meant, according to Hardy, is that the underlying concepts that constitute number theory are deeper and more elegant compared to those of any other branch of mathematics.

Another theme is that mathematics is a "young man's game", so anyone with a talent for mathematics should develop and use that talent while they are young, before their ability to create original mathematics starts to decline in middle age. This view reflects Hardy's increasing depression at the wane of his own mathematical powers. For Hardy, real mathematics was essentially a creative activity, rather than an explanatory or expository one.

==Critiques==
[[File:MathematiciansApology.jpg|thumb|First edition&lt;br&gt;(publ. [[Cambridge University Press]])]]

Hardy's opinions were heavily influenced by the [[academia|academic]] culture of the universities of [[Cambridge]] and [[Oxford]] between [[World War I]] and [[World War II]].

Some of Hardy's examples seem unfortunate in retrospect. For example, he writes, "No one has yet discovered any warlike purpose to be served by the theory of numbers or relativity, and it seems unlikely that anyone will do so for many years." Since then number theory was used to crack German enigma codes and much later, figure prominently in [[public-key cryptography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wayback.cecm.sfu.ca/personal/jborwein/apaper.pdf|title=Experimental mathematician Jonathan Borwein's comments on the Apology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hardy's more prominent examples of elegant mathematical discoveries with no use (proofs of [[Euclid's theorem|the infinitude of primes]] and of [[Square root of 2|the irrationality of the square root of two]]) still hold up.

The applicability of a mathematical concept is not the reason that Hardy considered applied mathematics somehow inferior to pure mathematics, though; it is the simplicity and prosiness that belong to applied mathematics that led him to describe them as he did.

He considers that [[Rolle's theorem]] for example, though it is of some importance for [[calculus]], cannot be compared to the elegance and preeminence of the mathematics produced by [[Évariste Galois]] and other pure mathematicians.

'''Alfred Baeumler''' (sometimes '''Bäumler'''; {{IPA-de|ˈbɔʏmlɐ|lang}}; 19 November 1887 – 19 March 1968), was an Austrian-born [[pedagogue]] and prominent Nazi ideologue. From 1924 he taught at the [[Technische Universität Dresden]], at first as an unsalaried lecturer [[Privatdozent]]. Bäumler was made [[associate professor]] (Extraordinarius) in 1928 and [[full professor]] (Ordinarius) a year later. From 1933 he taught philosophy and political education in [[Berlin]] as the director of the Institute for Political Pedagogy.

==Biography==
An influential philosopher in [[Nazi Germany]], Baeumler used [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s philosophy to legitimize [[Nazism]]. [[Thomas Mann]] read Baeumler's work on Nietzsche in the early 1930s, and characterized passages of it as "[[Hitler]] prophecy".&lt;ref&gt;''Thomas Mann und Alfred Baeumler'', Würzburg: Königshausen &amp; Neumann, 1989, p.&amp;nbsp;185&lt;/ref&gt;  Baeumler's 1931 book ''Nietzsche, der Philosoph und Politiker'' states:

{{quote|text=A theory of the state is not to be found in Nietzsche's work – but this work has opened all paths towards a new theory of the state. … His attack on the "Empire" arises from the feeling of a world-historical task that awaits us. He wanted to hear nothing of the state as a moral organism in [[Hegel]]'s sense, he also wanted to hear nothing of [[Otto Von Bismarck|Bismarck]]'s [[Christian]] [[Lesser Germany]] ("Kleindeutschland"). Before his eyes stood the task of our race: the task of being leader of [[Europe]]. … ''What would Europe be without the [[Germanic tribes|Germanic]] North? What would Europe be without Germany? A [[Roman Empire|Roman]] colony''. … Germany can only exist world-historically in the form of greatness. It has the choice to exist as the anti-Roman power of Europe, or not to exist. … The German state of the future will not be a continuation of Bismarck's creation, but will be created out of the spirit of Nietzsche and the spirit of the [[World War I|Great War]] (from pp. 180–183. Italics in the original).}}

His books were published in [[Italy]] in the late 1990s by the ''Edizioni di Ar'', a [[far-right]] publishing house.&lt;ref&gt;Founded in 1963 by [[Franco Freda]], a neo-fascist condemned to 15 years of imprisonment for "subversive association" and involvement in several bombings&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alicja Gescinska''' (Warsaw, 1981) is a Polish-Belgian philosopher.

==Academic career==
Gescinska obtained a Master’s degree summa cum laude in Moral Sciences at [[Ghent University]]. She became Doctor of Philosophy at the same university in 2012, having written a dissertation on the philosophy of [[Max Scheler]] and [[Karol Wojtyla]]: ''Freedom and Persons: A Philosophical Inquiry into the Meaning of Human Agency in the Thought of Max Scheler and Karol Wojtyla''.

Her book ''De verovering van de vrijheid'' (The conquest of freedom) – a philosophical and personal reflection on the meaning of freedom – was very well received. It was awarded by deMens.nu as the best non-fiction book of 2010-2011, and was shortlisted for other literary prizes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.demens.nu/nl/OpiniesEnNieuws/nieuwsberichten/content/eersteprijsdemensnu.html www.demens.nu]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 she wrote an essay on fear and freedom, which is based on the Freedom Lecture she delivered on the Dutch [[Liberation Day]], 5 May 2012, at [[Felix Meritis]] in Amsterdam. The essay concerns the way in which resentment and hatred lead to the decline of personal and political freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.felix.meritis.nl/nl/agenda/herdenken-vieren-vrijheidslezing-5-mei |title=www.felix.meritis.nl |access-date=2013-11-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314115927/http://www.felix.meritis.nl/nl/agenda/herdenken-vieren-vrijheidslezing-5-mei |archive-date=2014-03-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2013-2014 Gescinska worked as a postdoctoral researcher at [[Princeton University]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://princeton.academia.edu/AlicjaGescinska Faculty page at Princeton]&lt;/ref&gt; after which she began working at [[Amherst College]] where she teaches courses on the philosophy of freedom and on European politics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amherst.edu/people/facstaff/agescinska Faculty page at Amherst]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media personality==
She is in demand as a pundit in Belgium and The Netherlands. She is a member of the “Philosophical Team” of the Dutch newspaper ''[[Trouw]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/5116/Filosofie/article/detail/3262185/2012/05/28/Vrijheid-is-het-meest-misbruikte-woord-in-de-politiek.dhtml www.trouw.nl]&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote a fortnightly philosophical column for the Belgian newspaper ''[[De Morgen]]'' from 2012 to 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.demorgen.be/dm/nl/2461/Opinie/article/detail/1608085/2013/04/03/Al-het-waardevolle-in-het-leven-is-moeilijk-en-zeldzaam.dhtml Column from 3 April 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 her debut novel, ''Een soort van liefde'' (A Kind of Love), was published by [[De Bezige Bij]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.debezigebij.nl/boeken/een-soort-van-liefde/ Book page on publisher's website]&lt;/ref&gt; She also presented the programme ''Wanderlust'' on the Belgian television channel [[Canvas (Belgium)|Canvas]],&lt;ref&gt;Sandra Cardoen, [http://deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws/cultuur%2Ben%2Bmedia/media/1.2726841 Canvas pakt uit met "Wanderlust" en "Wereldbeeld"], ''[[De Redactie]]'', 1 August 2016. Accessed 3 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; in which she travelled to meet and interview philosophers, writers, artists and scientists.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Stroobants, [https://communicatie.canvas.be/nieuw-op-canvas--wanderlust-alicja-gescinska-op-zoek-naar-de-zin-van-het-bestaan Nieuw op Canvas: Wanderlust], canvas.be, 26 August 2016. Accessed 3 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In the first episode she met English philosopher [[Roger Scruton]], in the second Scottish sculptor [[Alexander Stoddart]], in the third Dutch novelist [[Connie Palmen]], in the fourth neuroscientist [[Raymond Tallis]], and in the fifth [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine monk]] [[Laurence Freeman]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.canvas.be/video/wanderlust Wanderlust], canvas.be. Accessed 3 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
In September 2017 the first episode of the second season of Wanderlust was broadcast. The second season includes episodes with [[Youssou N'Dour]], [[Theodore Dalrymple]], [[Lesley Hazleton]] and [[Sara Maitland]]. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.canvas.be/wanderlust&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[theology]], '''angelism''' is a pejorative for arguments that [[human being]] as essentially [[angel]]ic, and therefore [[sin]]-less in actual nature. The term is used as a criticism, to identify ideas which reject conceptions of human nature as being (to some degree) sinful and [[lust]]ful: 
:"[Angelism] minimizes [[concupiscence]] and therefore ignores the need for moral vigilance and prayer to cope with the consequences of [[original sin]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/dictionary/index.cfm?id=31808 |title=Dictionary : ANGELISM |publisher=Catholicculture.org |date=2014-12-08 |accessdate=2015-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although an [[academic]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]] and never an active member of any Marxist political party, his thought exerted influence on many political theorists in Italy during the early 20th century, including the founder of the [[Italian Liberal Party (1943)|Italian Liberal Party]], [[Benedetto Croce]] and the leaders of the [[Italian Communist Party]], [[Antonio Gramsci]] and [[Amadeo Bordiga]].

==Biography==
Labriola was born in [[Cassino, Italy|Cassino]] (then in the [[Papal States]]), the son a schoolteacher. In 1861, he entered the [[University of Naples]]. Upon graduating, he remained in [[Naples]] and became a schoolteacher. During this period, he pursued an interest in philosophy, [[history]] and [[ethnography]]. The early 1870s saw Labriola take up [[journalism]] and his writings from this time express [[Liberalism|liberal]] and [[Anti-clericalism|anticlerical]] views.

In 1874, Labriola was appointed as a [[professor]] in [[Rome]], where he was to spend the rest of his life teaching, writing and debating. Although he had been critical of liberalism since 1873, his move towards Marxism was gradual, and he did not explicitly express a [[Socialism|socialist]] viewpoint until 1889. He died in Rome on 2 February 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cultureducazione.it/antoniolabriola/cartearchivio.htm |title=Antonio Labriola e la sua Università}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thought==
Heavily influenced by [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] and [[Johann Friedrich Herbart]], Labriola's approach to Marxist theory was more open-ended than the orthodoxy of theorists such as [[Karl Kautsky]]. He saw Marxism not as a final, self-sufficient schematisation of history, but rather as a collection of pointers to the understanding of human affairs.

These pointers needed to be somewhat imprecise if Marxism was to take into account the complicated social processes and variety of forces at work in history. Marxism was to be understood as a "''[[Social theory|critical theory]]''", in the sense that it sees no truths as everlasting, and was ready to drop its own ideas if experience should so dictate. His description of Marxism as a "philosophy of [[Praxis (process)|praxis]]" would appear again in Gramsci's ''[[Prison Notebooks]]''.

'''Armin Mohler''' (12 April 1920 – 4 July 2003) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]]-born [[far right]] political writer and philosopher associated with the [[Neue Rechte]] movement.

==Life==
Born in [[Basel]], Mohler studied at the [[University of Basel]], where he briefly supported [[communism]].

At 20, he was called up to the [[Swiss army]], but his reading the works of [[Oswald Spengler]] as well as the June 1941 [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]] made him defect to [[Nazi Germany]], which he supported, in 1942. He aimed to join the [[Waffen SS]], but Mohler was not trusted by the SS authorities, who refused to accept him.

Still, he remained in Berlin for another year before returning to Switzerland, where he was incarcerated for [[desertion]].

After World War II, he returned to study in [[Berlin]] and completed his doctoral thesis ''Die Konservative Revolution in Deutschland 1918-1932 (The Conservative Revolution in Germany, 1918-1932)'', under [[Karl Jaspers]] in 1949. The aim of his thesis was not only scientific but also providing old traditions for new pathways for a non-[[national socialist]] right in post-war Germany. In the same year, he worked as a secretary for his idol [[Ernst Jünger]] but increasingly felt that Jünger had become too moderate for his taste after the end of the war.

Mohler went on to work as a correspondent in [[Paris]] for ''[[Die Zeit]]'', from 1953 to 1961. After that he lived in [[Munich]], leading the Carl Friedrich von Siemens Foundation. For a brief period he worked as a speech writer for [[Franz Josef Strauß]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://business-and-science.de/ghostwriter-von-franz-josef-strauss|title=Ghostwriter von Franz Josef Strauß - Business And Science|language=de-DE|access-date=2016-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; but his influence was marginal. In 1967, he became the first to receive the [[Konrad Adenauer Prize]], which provoked strong media attacks on him.

In 1970, he became a major contributing editor to Caspar von Schrenck-Notzing's conservative monthly magazine ''Criticon'', Germany's most important platform for non-mainstream conservative thought for almost three decades. He died in [[Munich]], at the age of 83.

==Writings and ideas==
Mohler's seminal work is his book ''Die Konservative Revolution in Deutschland 1918-1932'' ("The Conservative Revolution in Germany, 1918-1932"), which initially his doctoral thesis. There, he tried to unearth Weimar Republic right-wing thought and tradition apart from and alternative to National Socialism. The most crucial thinkers of the "[[Conservative Revolution]]" to him were [[Ernst Jünger]], [[Oswald Spengler]], [[Carl Schmitt]], [[Ernst Niekisch]], [[Hans Blüher]] and [[Thomas Mann]] (before his turn to liberalism).

Mohler was one of the first German publishers to write about the ideas of his long-time friend [[Alain de Benoist]], who founded the [[Nouvelle Droite]]. Similar as Benoist, Mohler advocated a Right that would oppose both socialism and liberalism, with a decided emphasis on the latter.

According to Michael Minkenberg, Mohler's ideas owed more to the Nouvelle Droite  associated with [[Groupement de recherche et d'études pour la civilisation européenne|GRECE]] than the [[Ostpolitik]]-derived ideas of a strong German state that was associated with contemporaries like [[Robert Spaemann]] and [[Gerd-Klaus Kaltenbrunner]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Minkenberg, 'The New Right in France and Germany: Nouvelle Droite, Neue Rechte, and the New Right Radical Parties', P. H. Merkl &amp; L Weinberg (eds.), The Revival of Right Wing Extremism in the Nineties, London: Frank Cass, 1997, pp. 73-4&lt;/ref&gt;

One of his favourite targets was the so-called "[[Vergangenheitsbewältigung]]", which he criticized in several books. That argument involved the claim that postwar Germany should 'step out of [[Hitler]]'s shadow'. It was thus claimed that Mohler was a forerunner of [[Ernst Nolte]] and associated thinkers, who were involved in the ''[[Historikerstreit]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.projects.v2.nl/~arns/Texts/leitkultur-e.html Prelude, Interlude, Afterlude. Spotlights on German Debates]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, Mohler contributed to journals such as ''[[Nation Europa]]'' and ''Die Tat'' (not to be confused with an older paper of the [[Die Tat|same title]]). He also wrote for mainstream newspapers such as ''[[Die Zeit]]'' and (in the 1960s and 1970s) ''[[Die Welt]]''. In his later years, he supported the "Neue Rechte" weekly paper ''[[Junge Freiheit]]''.

Under the alias 'Michael Hintermwald,' he also contributed two articles to [[Gerhard Frey (politician)|Gerhard Frey]]'s ''Deutschen National-Zeitung'' for which he was much criticized.

==Political activism==
Mohler was initially a supporter of [[Franz Josef Strauß]] and the [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria]] but later worked with [[Franz Schönhuber]] in the founding of [[The Republicans (Germany)|The Republicans]].

==Fascism==
Mohler's notion of Conservative Revolution has been described by some, like [[Roger Griffin]], as [[fascism]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Griffin, ''The Nature of Fascism'', London : Routledge, 1993, pp. 166-9&lt;/ref&gt; In a newspaper interview, Mohler accepted that he was a fascist but only in the tradition of [[José Antonio Primo de Rivera]] and with the acceptance of the notion that fascism had its roots in the [[far left]], as argued by [[Zeev Sternhell]].

{{Christian mysticism}}
'''Catholic spirituality''' includes the various ways in which [[Catholics]] live out their [[Baptism]]al promise through prayer and action. The primary prayer of all [[Catholics]] is the Eucharistic liturgy in which they celebrate and share their faith together, in accord with Jesus' instruction: "[[Words of Institution|Do this in memory of me]]." The Catholic bishops at the [[Second Vatican Council]] decreed that "devotions should be so drawn up that they harmonize with the liturgical seasons, accord with the sacred liturgy, are in some fashion derived from it, and lead the people to it, since, in fact, the liturgy by its very nature far surpasses any of them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19631204_sacrosanctum-concilium_en.html|title=Sacrosanctum concilium|website=www.vatican.va|access-date=2017-05-16}} Number 13.&lt;/ref&gt; In accord with this, many additional forms of prayer have developed over the centuries as means of animating one's personal Christian life, at times in gatherings with others. Each of the [[religious order]]s and congregations of the Catholic church, as well as [[laity|lay]] groupings, has specifics to its own spirituality – its way of approaching God in prayer to foster its way of living out the [[Gospel]].

== Catholic devotional piety ==
{{Main|Catholic devotions}}
{{further|Devotional literature}}

Catholic piety takes its inspiration from the life and teaching of Jesus Christ. Most fundamentally, Jesus prayed to [[God the Father]], in the [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|Holy Spirit]], and recommended that we do the same. In the [[Gospel]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s his prayer starts with "Father" and the prayer he taught his disciples begins with the words "Our Father". From this the Catholic Church has developed a piety that for the most part mirrors Jesus's attitude. The prayers of the [[Eucharist|Mass]], the public prayer of the Church, are characteristically addressed to God the Father. The Catholic [[bishop]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s declared in 1963: "Devotions should be so drawn up that they harmonize with the liturgical seasons, accord with the sacred liturgy, are in some fashion derived from it, and lead the people to it, since, in fact, the liturgy by its very nature far surpasses any of them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19631204_sacrosanctum-concilium_en.html|title=Sacrosanctum concilium, 13|last=|first=|date=|website=www.vatican.va|access-date=2017-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Desert spirituality ==
{{unsourced-section|date=April 2017}}
Desert spirituality is a way of seeking [[God]] that is characterized by the "desert theology" of the [[Old Testament]] that remains central to the Judeo-Christian tradition, namely God keeping his People wandering for 40 years in the [[Wilderness of Sin|desert]] and in subsequent centuries calling them into the desert as a testing ground, where they may experience a change of heart and, by proving themselves obedient to his ordering of human living, again accept him their Creator as also their Lord.

In [[New Testament]] times it is likewise for the reason of discerning God's will and proving his obedience that [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]] retired to the desert after his vocation call (cf. {{bibleverse||Mark|1:12-13}}, {{bibleverse||Matthew|4:1-11}}, {{bibleverse||Luke|4:1-13}}).

The [[Christian]] [[hermit|eremitic]] vocation has the same purpose, as the name [[hermit]] applied to those that embrace it indicates.

Among those most widely known for living a desert spirituality during the early Christian centuries is [[Anthony the Great|St Anthony of Egypt]] (251-356). He lived as a [[hermit]] for ten years, practiced [[asceticism]] for his whole life, and grew his own food for sustenance.

From the life of someone alone being dedicated to seeking God in the desert, which is the earliest form of Christian [[Monk|monasticism]], the monastic life in [[Cenobium|community]] has emerged, although the [[Consecrated life#Other forms of consecrated life|eremitic vocation]] continues as a distinct way of seeking God even today.

In practical terms this spiritual quest is pursued through prayer in solitude and asceticism.

Some adherents of desert spirituality – whether as [[Hermit|eremitic]] or [[Cenobium|cenobitic]] [[Monk|monastics]], or as Christian faithful outside the [[Consecrated life|religious life]] – practise [[centering prayer]]. One form of this prayer has one meditate on a single, sacred word to draw the believer closer to God by withdrawing compulsive infatuation with particular sensory objects and conceptual constructions. This practice was prominent in Catholic practice (at least) as early as the 13th century, as evinced by works such as ''[[The Cloud of Unknowing]]'' – written anonymously in [[Middle English]] by a Catholic monastic.

==Monastic orders==

=== Benedictine spirituality ===
Benedictine spirituality is characterized by striving towards Christian perfection in community, liturgical prayer, and separation from worldly concerns. [[St. Benedict]] (480-550) is considered to be the Father of Western Monasticism. He wrote The Rule and established his first monastery at Monte Cassino, Italy. [[Lectio divina|Lectio Divina]] is a Benedictine prayer form based on praying with the Word of God. Lectio Divina has four "moments": Lectio (Reading Scripture), Meditatio (Reflection on the Word), Oratio (Praying), and Contemplatio (Silently listening to God). As practiced today it includes coming together several times daily to sing God's praises, so that gratitude to God might fill all one's work. Key people involved in the 20th and 21st century include [[Thomas Merton]] and [[Basil Pennington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/benedictine-spirituality|title=Benedictine Spirituality - Dictionary definition of Benedictine Spirituality {{!}} Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary|website=www.encyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Franciscan spirituality ===
Franciscan spirituality is characterized by a life of poverty, love of nature, and charitable deeds towards those in need. [[St. Francis of Assisi]] (1182–1226) was the son of a wealthy merchant. He rejected all of his possessions and founded a community of brothers (friars) who lived in poverty and served the poor. Franciscan prayer recognizes God's presence in the wonder of creation, as expressed in St. Francis' [[Canticle of the Sun]]. Franciscan spirituality is focused on walking in Christ's footsteps and sharing one's experience of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://franciscanaction.org/earthcorps/spirituality|title=Franciscan Spirituality {{!}} Franciscan Action Network|website=franciscanaction.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dominican spirituality ===
Dominican spirituality is characterized by poverty, preaching God's Word, and defense of Catholic doctrine. [[Saint Dominic|St. Dominic]] (1170–1221) encountered heretics on a journey in France. His opinion was that the people were not to blame, the preachers were. If there are good, orthodox preachers, then the people will be good and orthodox also. And so he founded the "Order of Preachers" or "Dominicans", who draw their inspiration from contemplating Christ's humanity. One of the ways of praying that goes back to the Dominicans is the [[Rosary]].  Legend has it that Mary herself gave the Rosary to Dominic. The Rosary is characteristic of Dominican spirituality because it focuses attention on the principal mysteries of the life of Jesus Christ, can lead to contemplation, and is a way of proclaiming the truths of faith. Some members of the Dominican Order have made significant contributions to Catholic thought as did St. [[St. Thomas Aquinas|Thomas Aquinas]], the most prominent scholar in the [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] tradition. He argued that teaching the faith was a superior form of contemplative prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://opcentral.org/blog/dominican-spirituality/|title=Dominican Spirituality|website=opcentral.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ignatian spirituality ===
[[Ignatian spirituality]] is characterized by examination of one's life, discerning the will of God, finding God in all things (hence their motto "''[[Ad maiorem Dei gloriam]]''" or "For the Greater Glory of God"), and living the Resurrection. [[St. Ignatius of Loyola]] (1491–1556) was a wounded soldier when he first began to read about Christ and the saints. He had a [[Religious conversion|conversion]] experience while healing which led over time to his founding the [[Society of Jesus]], known as the Jesuits. His classic, the [[Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola|Spiritual Exercises]], is a guide for making a retreats, for which he is the Church's patron. Jesuits are quite diverse, despite rumors to the contrary, but are united by a zeal that comes from every Jesuit making the Spiritual Exercises. Lay Catholics make a shortened version of the Exercises at retreat houses wherein the director, as did Ignatius, guides each retreatant separately through reflections and "application of the senses" to Jesus' life, for discernment as to what God is asking of them.

Ignatian Spirituality incorporates elements from earlier spiritual traditions: finding God in all things, or being a contemplative in action, has been likened to the spirituality of St. Francis of Assisi whom Ignatius admired. Meditation/contemplation on the [[Gospel]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s has roots in the Benedictine [[Lectio Divina]]. However, Ignatian Spirituality is adaptable as is clear from Ignatius' book on the Exercises. For instance, [[Pedro Arrupe]] (1907-1991), a prominent Superior General of the Jesuits from 1965-1983, was known for incorporating [[Zen]] meditative techniques to assist in his concentration. Another example of adaptability is the extent to which the individual exercitant applies imagination, quite presence, or discursive reasoning to the events of Jesus' life, to arrive at closer knowledge and following of the [[Jesus is Lord|Lord]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ignatianspirituality.com/|title=Home - Ignatian Spirituality|website=Ignatian Spirituality|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Carmelite spirituality ===
[[Carmelite]] spirituality is characterised by interior detachment, silence, solitude, the desire for spiritual progress, and insight into mystical experiences. The roots of the Carmelite Order go back to a group of hermits living on Mt. Carmel in Israel during the 12th Century. Saints [[John of the Cross]] (1542–1591) and [[Teresa of Ávila]] (1515–1582) were Carmelite mystics whose writings are spiritual classics. In ''[[Ascent of Mount Carmel]]'' John of the Cross teaches that purgation of the soul through mortification and suppression of desires is necessary for the transition through darkness to divine union with God. Teresa of Avila emphasized the importance of [[mental prayer]] which she defined as "spending time with a friend whom we know loves us."

Other important figures in Carmelite Spirituality include [[Thérèse of Lisieux]] (Doctor of the Church), [[Magdalena de Pazzi|Mary Magdalene de Pazzi]], [[Lúcia Santos|Sister Lúcia of Fátima]], [[Nuno Álvares Pereira|Nuno of Saint Mary]], [[Elizabeth of the Trinity]], [[Marie-Antoinette de Geuser]] known as "Consumata", [[Edith Stein]], [[Teresa of the Andes|Teresa of Los Andes]], [[Teresa Margaret of the Sacred Heart]], [[Joaquina Vedruna de Mas|Joaquina de Vedruna]], [[Angelus of Jerusalem]], and [[Brother Lawrence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.carmelite.org/index.php?nuc=content&amp;id=7|title=Carmelite Spirituality|website=www.carmelite.org|access-date=2017-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Redemptorist spirituality ===
[[Redemptorist]] spirituality consists of the Crib, the Cross, and the [[Sacrament]]. In other words, the Redemptorists follow [[Christ]] in his incarnation, death, and resurrection and believe that he is always with them. They emphasize the encounter with Christ in the Blessed Sacrament, and have their founder's popular version of the Way of the Cross and the [[Christmas carol]]s which he composed. With a practical focus, Redemptorist spirituality would render help to the those in dire spiritual or material need, based on Jesus' invitation to follow him. One of the most tangible ways they do this is to proclaim the Gospel in simple ways to ordinary people, taking as their motto Jesus' words when he quoted [[Isaiah]]: “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me…. to preach Good News to the poor,… liberty to captives,… sight to the blind,… to proclaim the year of the Lord's favour ([[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 4:18-19).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.redemptorists.net/redemptorist-spirituality.cfm|title=Redemptorist spirituality|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
===Servite spirituality===
The spirituality of the [[Servite]] order is focused on contemplating Mary at the foot of the cross as a model for Christian life and service to the suffering.  Moreover, because the order has [[Seven Holy Founders]] rather than one individual founder, there is a particular emphasis on the communal aspect of Christian life. This spirituality finds expression particularly in the [[Rosary of the Seven Sorrows]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://servidimaria.net/sitoosm/en/spirituality.html|title=Spirituality|website=servidimaria.net|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Montfortian spirituality===

''God Alone'' was the motto of Saint [[Louis de Montfort]] and is repeated over 150 times in his writings. ''[[God Alone]]'' is also the title of his collected writings. Briefly speaking, based on his writings, [[Company of Mary|Montfortian]] spirituality can be summed up by the formula: "To God Alone, by Christ Wisdom, in the Spirit, in communion with Mary, for the reign of God." Although St Louis is perhaps best known for his [[Roman Catholic Mariology|Mariology]] and devotion to the [[BVM(RC)|Blessed Virgin Mary]], his spirituality is founded on the mystery of the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] and is centered on Christ, as is clear in his famous [[Saint Louis de Montfort's Prayer to Jesus|Prayer to Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.montfort.org.uk/Spirituality/LMSpirOverview.php|title=Montfortian Spirituality - Overview|website=www.montfort.org.uk|access-date=2017-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-Vatican II lay movements ==
:''See also [[Roman Catholic Church#Laity|Laity in the Catholic Church]]''

The [[Second Vatican Council]] popularized spiritual movements among Catholics, and some lay Catholics now engage in regular contemplative practices such as [[centering prayer]]. Consistent with Vatican II, contemporary spiritual movements usually emphasize the necessity both of an interior relationship with God (private prayer) and works of justice and charity. Major 20th century writers who sought to draw together the contemplative and active poles of Christian spirituality have been [[Dorothy Day]], [[Thomas Merton]], and [[Richard Rohr]].

The purpose of all [[laity|lay]] movements in the Catholic Church is to spread in society a deep awareness that every person is called by Baptism to live be a holy life and each in his own way to become an ambassador of Christ, For the majority of Christians, God calls them to sanctiy through their ordinary lives by an ever-growing charity in the way they think, speak, and act, beginning at home, the domestic church, but extending to the local Christian community, the workplace, and to all peoples, all God's children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19641121_lumen-gentium_en.html|title=Lumen gentium|last=Chapters 2 and 5|first=|date=|website=www.vatican.va|access-date=2017-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Christian Life Community]] ([[Christian Life Community|CLC]]) is an international association of [[Catholic laity|lay Christians]] who have adopted an [[Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola|Ignatian]] model of spiritual life. The 'Community' is present in almost sixty countries. The CLC traces its foundation to 1563, when the [[Jesuit]] John Leunis gathered a group of lay students at the [[Roman College]] to form the [[Sodality of Our Lady]]. The Sodality grew and was confirmed by [[Pope Gregory XIII]] in 1584. When the [[Second Vatican Council]] urged groups like the Sodality to rediscover their original roots, some sodalities continued as before, while others became Christian Life Communities. The main difference is in the size (6 to 12) and the regularity of meeting (weekly or biweekly).

The CLC draws its inspiration from the teachings of St. [[Ignatius of Loyola]], and receives spiritual guidance from the [[Jesuits]]. The experience of making the [[Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola|Spiritual Exercises]] of St Ignatius is of paramount importance to the members of the CLC. Members are encouraged to adhere to a lifestyle which is gospel-based and simple, to serve the poor and to integrate contemplation and action. As Ignatian spirituality has an essential [[Apostle (Christian)|apostolic]] dimension, members of the CLC do reflect also on how to bring [[Gospel]] values into all aspects of life in today's world.

=== Charismatic spirituality ===
{{Main|Catholic Charismatic Renewal}}

Charismatic spirituality reflects a belief that the spiritual gifts present in the early Christian communities are still available to the Church today. More active sharing of spiritual experiences in community characterizes this spirituality.

=== Schoenstatt Movement ===
{{Main|Schoenstatt Movement}}

Schoenstatt emphasizes a strong devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary, upholding her as a perfect example of love and purity. Schoenstatt seeks to invite the Blessed Mother (and hence her divine Son, Jesus Christ) into the home by establishing a spiritual Covenant of Love with her. It encourages its members to have the faith and purity of children, and to think of Mary as their mother.

=== Focolare Movement ===
{{Main|Focolare Movement}}

In 1943 in northern Italy during World War II, [[Chiara Lubich]], together with a small group of friends, concluded that God is the only ideal worth living for. The Focolare movement was founded as a result. The goal was to strive towards the fulfillment of Jesus’ prayer to the Father: “That they all may be one” (John 17:21).  A spirituality of unity resulted and gave rise to a movement of spiritual and social renewal. Now embracing over 5 million members in 182 countries, Focolare (which means hearth) draws together groups of families, neighbors, and friends to build community and to extend the works of the Gospel.

=== Sant'Egidio Movement ===
The [[Community of Sant'Egidio|Sant'Egidio community]] began with a group of high school students in the 1960s who were convinced by a local priest in Rome to try an experiment: live for a time as the early Christian disciples did, gathering for prayer and shared meals daily in their neighborhood as well as joining together in the corporal and spiritual works of mercy.  The community thrived and has now become a global movement of communities working for peace and justice, strengthened by daily life in common and prayer.

=== Opus Dei spirituality ===
{{Main|Opus Dei}}

[[Opus Dei]] predated the Second Vatican Council in its emphasis on the laity. Founded by St. [[Josemaría Escrivá]], Opus Dei's spirituality is based on life in the secular world. The "sanctification of work" consists in offering all work, however ordinary, to God. This implies that one always does one's best. To be a contemplative is to integrate one's life ("unity of life") in faithfulness to the Catholic Church and in solidarity with all those with whom one comes into contact, living a life of faith in all circumstances of each day. As John Allen says: people who follow this spirituality enter a church and leave it for the same reason – to get closer to God. The members of Opus Dei and its cooperators have committed to convert their daily work into prayer. [[Pope John Paul I]], a few years before his election, wrote that Escrivá was more radical than other saints who taught about the [[universal call to holiness]]. While others emphasized monastic spirituality applied to lay people, for Escrivá "it is the material work itself which must be turned into prayer and sanctity," thus providing a comprehensive lay spirituality.&lt;ref name=Luciani&gt;prayer with the spiritual assistance of the prelature.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Expressed this way, Opus Dei builds on "finding God in all things" from Ignatian spirituality and emphasizes the universality of this path to holiness.

=== Regnum Christi spirituality ===
{{Main|Regnum Christi}}

[[Regnum Christi]] focuses on the mission of every baptized person to evangelize. Each member is called to pray, meet in community, and do some form of apostolate (which varies from member to member). Their motto is "Love Christ, Serve People, Build the Church." They express their ethos as loving Christ, Mary, Souls, the Church, and the Pope. Regnum Christi is somewhat unusual among the lay movements as it is bound to a religious community, the [[Legion of Christ]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8606">'''Editio Octava Critica Maior''' is a critical edition of the Greek New Testament produced by [[Constantin von Tischendorf]]. It was Tischendorf's eighth edition of the Greek Testament, and the most important, published between 1864 and 1894.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Edition==
The first volume was issued in 11 parts, beginning in 1864. They were published in two volumes in 1869 and 1872. The edition was accompanied by a rich critical apparatus in which he assembled all of the variant readings that he or his predecessors had found in manuscripts, versions, and fathers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Metzger|first1=Bruce M.|authorlink1=Bruce M.

Tischendorf died before he could finish his edition, and the third volume, containing the Prolegomena, was prepared and edited by [[C. R. Gregory]] and issued in three parts (1884, 1890, 1894).&lt;ref name = Nestle/&gt;&lt;ref name = Waltz/&gt;

Tischendorf gave the evidence known in his time. He used 64 [[List of New Testament uncials|uncial manuscripts]], a single [[List of New Testament papyri|papyrus manuscript]], and a small number of [[List of New Testament minuscules|minuscule manuscripts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The number of inaccuracies is  smaller than in 20th-century manual editions.&lt;ref name = Aland/&gt;

Tischendorf did not have a detailed textual theory. In practice he had a strong preference for the readings of the manuscript of his own discovery – [[Codex Sinaiticus]]. His text is eclectic but generally the [[Alexandrian text-type|Alexandrian]]. It has also  something from the [[Western text-type]], especially when it agrees with [[Codex Bezae]].&lt;ref name = Waltz&gt;Robert Waltz, [http://pericopedeadultera.com/RECON/Tisch-App.html ''Tischendorf's Apparatus'']&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of his work Tischendorf had practically no access to [[Codex Vaticanus]], and it was published too late to alter the basic structure of Tischendorf's edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

== Influence ==

Tischendorf's ''Editio Octava'' and ''[[The New Testament in the Original Greek]]'' of [[Brooke Foss Westcott|Westcott]] and [[Fenton John Anthony Hort|Hort]] were sufficient to make the [[Textus Receptus]] obsolete for the scholarly world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

According to [[Eberhard Nestle]] the text of the eighth edition differs from the seventh edition in 3,572 places.&lt;ref name = Nestle/&gt; Nestle has accused this edition of giving weight to the evidence of [[Codex Sinaiticus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Metzger|first1=Bruce M.|authorlink1=Bruce M.

'''Edward Bentham''' (23 July 1707 – 1 August 1776) was an [[Oxford]] based [[theologian]] who in 1763, with some evident reluctance,  became [[Regius Professor of Divinity]] at [[Oxford University]].&lt;ref name=DNBEdwardBentham&gt;{{cite web|author=[[William Hunt (priest)|William Hunt]]|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bentham,_Edward_%28DNB00%29|publisher= Smith, Elder &amp; Co. &amp; [[Wikisource]]|title=BENTHAM, EDWARD, D.D.

==Life==

===Family, provenance and early years===
Edward Bentham was born at [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]] where his father, the Rev. Samuel Bentham, was employed as a minor canon at [[Ely Cathedral|the cathedral]].&lt;ref name=odnbEB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/2150|title=Bentham, Edward (1707–1776), Church of England clergyman and ... was...  |publisher=Oxford University Press|work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.

His younger brother, [[James Bentham]] achieved distinction as an antiquarian and historian of Ely Cathedral.&lt;ref name=odnbJB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/2152|title=Bentham, James (1709–1794), antiquary and Church of England clergyman, was...  |publisher=Oxford University Press|work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.

===Oxford===
In 1717, on the recommendation of [[George Smalridge|Dr. Smalridge]], then a fellow of [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church college]], Bentham was sent away to [[Oxford]] where he sang as a chorister at [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]],&lt;ref name=EdBentvolgensKippis&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ixcAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA181 |title=The Life of Edward Bentham|author=[[Andrew Kippis|Dr. Kippis]]|date=1785|work=The London Magazine Enlarged and Improved, Volume the fourth|pages=181–184|publisher=Printed for R.Baldwin, Pater-Noster-Row, London}}&lt;/ref&gt; before entering [[Christ Church, Oxford|the college]] as a student on 28 March 1724.&lt;ref name=odnbJB/&gt;   He studied under the supervision of [[John Burton (scholar)|John Burton]], a cousin who became also a friend.&lt;ref name=DNBEdwardBentham/&gt;  He was listed as a scholar in 1726.&lt;ref name=HistRegOx&gt;{{cite web|title="The historical register of the University of Oxford: being a supplement to the Oxford University calendar, with an alphabetical record of University honours and distinctions completed to the end of Trinity term 1888"|url=https://archive.org/stream/historicalregist00univuoft/historicalregist00univuoft_djvu.txt| publisher=The Internet Archive|accessdate=9 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Sources commend Bentham's erudition and even temperament. As soon as he had taken his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree he was invited by the principal of [[Hertford College, Oxford#Magdalen Hall|Magdalen Hall]] to become vice-principal of that college, and took up the appointment on 6 March 1730 ([[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]]), still aged only 22.&lt;ref name=EdBentvolgensKippis/&gt;   However, the appointment proved short-lived, since on 23 April 1731 he was elected to the fellowship at [[Oriel College]], where he was appointed a tutor the next year.&lt;ref name=EdBentvolgensKippis/&gt;   He retained the tutorship at Oriel till 1752.&lt;ref name=odnbEB/&gt;

Further promotions and appointments followed. He obtained his [[Bachelor of Divinity]] degree on 26 March 1743,&lt;ref name=EdBentvolgensKippis/&gt; becoming a [[Doctor of Divinity]] in 1749.&lt;ref name=odnbEB/&gt;    On 22 April 1743 he was allocated a [[Prebendary|Prebendary stall]] at [[Hereford Cathedral]].&lt;ref name=EdBentvolgensKippis/&gt;   At Oxford he was nominated as a canon at [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]] in April 1754, the previous canon, a Dr. Newton, having died. Bentham's installation followed on 9 June 1754, and while canon he also acted as subdean and treasurer for more than another twelve years.&lt;ref name=EdBentvolgensKippis/&gt;   He set in place reforms to address the "great confusion" in the "affairs of the [cathedral] treasury" which he found on taking up his appointment.&lt;ref name=EdBentvolgensKippis/&gt;  (There is also mention made of the "negligence of the deputy [treasurer]".)&lt;ref name=EdBentvolgensKippis/&gt;

It was at this time, on 22 June 1754, that Edward Bentham married Elizabeth Bates (died 1790) from [[Alton, Hampshire|Alton]] in the nearby county of [[Hampshire]].&lt;ref name=odnbEB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography names Elizabeth's father as Theophilus Bates of Alton in Hampshire.  The Dictionary of National Biography states that Theophilus Bates came from Alton in Hertfordshire. The reason for preferring Hampshire over Hertfordhire is that [[Alton, Hampshire|Alton]] in Hampshire is known to exist.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regius professorship===
Edward Bentham's appointment to the Oxford regius professorship of divinity took place in May&lt;ref name=EdBentvolgensKippis/&gt; or June&lt;ref name=odnbEB/&gt; 1763, following the death of the previous incumbent, [[John Fanshawe]]. The professorship came with an automatic entitlement to a canonry at [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]]:  unfortunately, however, the eighth&lt;ref name=EdBentvolgensKippis/&gt; prebendary chair to which this canonry entitled him was lower in the Christ Church cathedral hierarchy than the fifth&lt;ref name=EdBentvolgensKippis/&gt; prebendary chair which Bentham had up till now occupied since 1754.&lt;ref name=EdBentvolgensKippis/&gt;  In this sense, it was impossible to avoid the observation that elevation to the regius professorship represented not merely an academic promotion but also a canonical demotion.&lt;ref name=odnbEB/&gt;   In this context the [[Thomas Secker|Archbishop of Canterbury]] supplied a critique of the appointment (which he had himself recommended to the king and energetically encouraged Bentham to accept) in a letter written to the [[Robert Hay Drummond|Archbishop of York]] on 31 May 1763: "I am sorry for poor Bentham, but I am glad for the University". It is also reported that Edward Bentham's brother, the church historian [[James Bentham]], saw the regius professorship as a step along the way to further ecclesiastical promotion; but in the event Edward Bentham was still serving as the Oxford University regius professor of divinity when he died more than thirteen years later, in October 1776.&lt;ref name=odnbEB/&gt;

Bentham was an active regius professor. Encouraged by [[Thomas Secker|Archbishop Secker]], in 1764 he instigated a yearly course of thrice weekly lectures for those intending to seek [[ordination]] into the [[Church of England|English priesthood]]. The "striking innovation" in this context, according to the twentieth-century historian R.Greaves, was that Bentham did not charge any fees to students attending the lectures.&lt;ref name=odnbEB/&gt;&lt;ref name=Greves&gt;{{cite book|title=History of the University of Oxford: The Eighteenth Century|author1=R.Greaves|author2= L.S. Sutherland, L.G.Mitchell &amp; T.H.Aston (volume editors)|volume=5|publisher=OUP|page=406|isbn=978-0-19951-015-3|date=January 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Surviving notes by students indicate a real-world practical approach, coupled with an adherence to the lecturer's own moderate high church biblical orthodoxy.&lt;ref name=odnbEB/&gt;

During his lifetime Bentham was noted as an early riser who had often completed half a day's work before many others had begun their day. He enjoyed good health, but during his final years suffered a sporadic weakness in his eyes, attributed to "too free an use of them when he was young".&lt;ref name=EdBentvolgensKippis/&gt;   He was incapacitated by his final illness from 23 July 1776, but battled on with his studies "like a faithful soldier, in the exercise of his religion", dying at the start of the next month.&lt;ref name=EdBentvolgensKippis/&gt;

==Evaluation==
Edward Bentham had a wide circle of friends in the academic world, but he also had his critics, and he seems to have made a long term enemy of William King, the Master of St Mary Hall (college), who after his death described Bentham waspishly as "Half a casuist, half lawyer, half Courtier, half Cit, Half Tory, half Whig (may I add, half a Wit?)".&lt;ref name=odnbEB/&gt;

After his death there were many, including his brother [[James Bentham|James]], who went into print with the opinion that he should have advanced further in his career than he did, but there are signs elsewhere that he lacked some of the ambition and political skill necessary for such advancement,&lt;ref name=odnbEB/&gt;&lt;ref name=EdBentvolgensKippis/&gt; "a very honest, virtuous, good man; a good husband and father, and an excellent brother, but ...[a] poor creature ... in conversation, manner, and behaviour...a plodding, industrious man, bred under his cousin John Burton of Eton," according to the antiquary [[William Cole (antiquary)|William Cole]] who evidently knew him.&lt;ref name=DNBEdwardBentham/&gt;   The criticisms are more quotable, and more quoted, than the plaudits, but it is nevertheless clear that Edward Bentham was also widely admired and liked.&lt;ref name=EdBentvolgensKippis/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4031">'''Egocentric presentism''' is a form of [[solipsism]] introduced by [[Caspar John Hare|Caspar Hare]] in which other persons can be conscious, but their experiences are simply not {{em|present}}.&lt;ref name="JPhil"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hare|first=Caspar|title=Self-Bias, Time-Bias, and the Metaphysics of Self and Time|journal=The Journal of Philosophy|date=July 2007|volume=104|issue=7|pages=350–373|url=http://web.mit.edu/~casparh/www/Papers/CJHareSelfBias2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hare|first=Caspar|title=On Myself, and Other, Less Important Subjects|year=2009|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9780691135311|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8921.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, in related work, Hare argues for a theory of [[perspectival realism]] in which other perspectives do exist, but the present perspective has a defining intrinsic property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hare|first=Caspar|title=Realism About Tense and Perspective|journal=Philosophy Compass|date=September 2010|volume=5|issue=9|pages=760–769|url=http://web.mit.edu/~casparh/www/Papers/CJHarePerspectivalRealism.pdf|doi=10.1111/j.1747-9991.2010.00325.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one example that Hare uses to illustrate his theory (starting on page 354 of the official version of his paper&lt;ref name="JPhil" /&gt;), you learn that you are one of two people, named A and B, who have just been in a train crash; and that A is about to have incredibly painful surgery. You cannot remember your name. Naturally, you hope to be B! The point of the example is that you know everything relevant that there is to know about the objective world; all that is missing is {{em|your}} position in it, that is, whose experiences are {{em|present}}, A's or B's. This example is easily handled by egocentric presentism because under this theory, the case where the present experiences are A's is fundamentally different from the case where the present experiences are B's. Hare points out that similar examples can be given to support theories like [[presentism (philosophy of time)|presentism]] in the philosophy of time.

Several other philosophers have written reviews of Hare's work on this topic.&lt;ref name="mcdaniels"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McDaniel|first=Kris|title=''On Myself, and Other, Less Important Subjects'' by Hare, Caspar - Review by: Kris McDaniel|journal=Ethics|date=January 2012|volume=122|issue=2|pages=403–410|url=http://krmcdani.mysite.syr.edu/whymcxmattersmost.pdf|doi=10.1086/663578}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="markosian"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Markosian|first=Ned|title=Are You Special?

'''Francis Bacon, 1st Viscount St Alban''',{{Efn|name=title|There is some confusion over the spelling of "Viscount St. Alban". Some sources, such as the ''Dictionary of National Biography'' (1885) and the [[Encyclopaedia Britannica, 11th edition|11th edition]] of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', spell the title with "St. Albans";{{Sfnp|Fowler|1885|p=346}}{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=135}} others, such as the 2007 ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' and the [[Encyclopaedia Britannica, 9th edition|9th edition]] of the ''Encyclopaedia Britannica'', spell it "St. Alban".{{Sfnp|Peltonen|2007}}{{sfnp|Adamson|1878|p=200}}}} {{post-nominals|country=GBR|PCe|QC}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|eɪ|k|ən}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/bacon "Bacon"] entry in ''[[Collins English Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; 22 January 1561{{spaced ndash}}9 April 1626) was an English philosopher and statesman, who served as [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]], and as [[Lord Chancellor]] of England. His works are credited with developing the [[scientific method]], and remained influential through the [[scientific revolution]].

Bacon has been called the father of [[empiricism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psychology.sbc.edu/Empiricism.htm |title=Empiricism: The influence of Francis Bacon, John Locke, and David Hume |publisher=Sweet Briar College|date= |accessdate=21 October 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130708012140/http://www.psychology.sbc.edu/Empiricism.htm|archivedate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; His works argued for the possibility of [[science|scientific]] [[knowledge]] based only upon [[inductive reasoning]] and careful observation of events in [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]]. Most importantly, he argued this could be achieved by use of a sceptical and methodical approach whereby scientists aim to avoid misleading themselves. While his own practical ideas about such a method, the ''[[Baconian method]]'', did not have a long-lasting influence, the general idea of the importance and possibility of a sceptical methodology makes Bacon the father of the scientific method. This marked a new turn in the rhetorical and theoretical framework for science, the practical details of which are still central in debates about science and [[methodology]] today. In addition to his work in the sciences, Bacon was also a venerable patron of libraries and developed a functional system for the cataloging of books by dividing them into three categories—history, poetry, and philosophy—which could further be divided into more specific subjects and subheadings.

Bacon is the first recipient of the [[Queen's Counsel|Queen's counsel]] designation, which was conferred in 1597 when [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] reserved Bacon as her legal advisor. After the accession of [[James VI and I|King James I]] in 1603,  Bacon was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]]. He was later created [[Baron Verulam]] in 1618{{sfnp|Adamson|1878|p=200}} and Viscount St. Alban in 1621.{{sfnp|Peltonen|2007}}&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;Contemporary spelling, used by Bacon himself in his letter of thanks to the king for his elevation.{{cite book |last=Birch |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Birch |title=Letters, Speeches, Charges, Advices, &amp;c of Lord Chancellor Bacon |volume=6 |year=1763 |publisher=Andrew Millar |location=London |pages=271–2 |oclc=228676038 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because he had no heirs, both titles became extinct upon his death in 1626, at 65 years of age.  Bacon died of [[pneumonia]], with one account by [[John Aubrey]] stating that he had contracted the condition while studying the effects of freezing on the preservation of meat. He is buried at [[St Michael's Church, St Albans]], Hertfordshire.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Scott.

==Biography==

===Early life===
[[File:18-year old Francis Bacon.jpg|thumb|The young Francis Bacon. Inscription around his head reads: ''Si tabula daretur digna animum mallem'', [[Latin language|Latin]] for "If one could but paint his mind". [[National Portrait Gallery, London]]]]

Francis Bacon was born on 22 January 1561 at [[York House, Strand|York House]] near the [[Strand, London|Strand]] in [[London]], the son of [[Nicholas Bacon (Lord Keeper)|Sir Nicholas Bacon]] by his second wife, [[Anne Bacon|Anne (Cooke) Bacon]], the daughter of the noted [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] [[Anthony Cooke]]. His mother's sister was married to [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley]], making Burghley Bacon's uncle.&lt;ref&gt;"Sir Francis Bacon's Journals". p. 191. universe, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Biographers believe that Bacon was educated at home in his early years owing to poor health, which would plague him throughout his life. He received tuition from John Walsall, a graduate of Oxford with a strong leaning toward [[Puritan]]ism. He entered [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], on 5 April 1573 at the age of 12,&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=BCN573F|name=Bacon, Francis }}&lt;/ref&gt; living for three years there, together with his older brother [[Anthony Bacon (1558–1601)|Anthony Bacon]] under the personal tutelage of [[John Whitgift|Dr John Whitgift]], future [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. Bacon's education was conducted largely in Latin and followed the medieval curriculum. He was also educated at the [[University of Poitiers]]. It was at Cambridge that he first met [[Queen Elizabeth I|Queen Elizabeth]], who was impressed by his precocious intellect, and was accustomed to calling him "The young lord keeper".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Collins |first=Arthur |title=The English Baronetage: Containing a Genealogical and Historical Account of All the English Baronets, Now Existing: Their Descents, Marriages, and Issues; Memorable Actions, Both in War, and Peace; Religious and Charitable Donations; Deaths, Places of Burial and Monumental Inscriptions {{sic}} |publisher=Printed for Tho. Wotton at the Three Daggers and Queen's Head |year=1741 |page=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His studies brought him to the belief that the methods and results of science as then practised were erroneous. His reverence for [[Aristotle]] conflicted with his rejection of [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian philosophy]], which seemed to him barren, disputatious and wrong in its objectives.

[[File:york Water Gate.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Italianate]] York Water Gate – the entry to York House, built about 1626, the year of Bacon's death]]

On 27 June 1576, he and Anthony entered ''de societate magistrorum'' at [[Gray's Inn]]. A few months later, Francis went abroad with Sir [[Amias Paulet]], the English ambassador at Paris, while Anthony continued his studies at home. The state of government and society in France under [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] afforded him valuable political instruction.{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=136}} For the next three years he visited [[Blois]], [[Poitiers]], [[Tours]], Italy, and Spain.&lt;ref name="travels"&gt;[[Stephen Gaukroger]] (2001). "Francis Bacon and the Transformation of Early-Modern Philosophy". p. 46. Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; During his travels, Bacon studied language, statecraft, and civil law while performing routine diplomatic tasks. On at least one occasion he delivered diplomatic letters to England for [[Francis Walsingham|Walsingham]], Burghley, and [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Leicester]], as well as for the queen.&lt;ref name="travels"/&gt;

The sudden death of his father in February 1579 prompted Bacon to return to England. Sir Nicholas had laid up a considerable sum of money to purchase an estate for his youngest son, but he died before doing so, and Francis was left with only a fifth of that money.{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=136}} Having borrowed money, Bacon got into debt. To support himself, he took up his residence in law at Gray's Inn in 1579,{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=136}} his income being supplemented by a grant from his mother Lady Anne of the manor of [[Marks (manor house)|Marks]] near [[Romford]] in Essex, which generated a rent of £46.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Spall | first = JEH | title = Francis Bacon's connections with Marks Manor House | journal = Romford Record | volume = No. 4 | pages = 32–37 | publisher = Romford and District Historical Society | location = Romford | date = 1971
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parliamentarian===
[[File:Francis Bacon statue, Gray's Inn.jpg|thumb|Francis Bacon's statue at [[Gray's Inn]], South Square, London]]

Bacon stated that he had three goals: to uncover truth, to serve his country, and to serve his church. He sought to further these ends by seeking a prestigious post. In 1580, through his uncle, [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|Lord Burghley]], he applied for a post at court that might enable him to pursue a life of learning, but his application failed. For two years he worked quietly at [[Gray's Inn]], until he was admitted as an [[outer barrister]] in 1582.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ellis|first1=Robert. P.|title=Francis Bacon: The Double-Edged Life of the Philosopher and Statesman|date=27 April 2015|publisher=McFarland|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His parliamentary career began when he was elected [[Member of Parliament (UK)|MP]] for [[Bossiney (UK Parliament constituency)|Bossiney, Cornwall]], in a [[by-election]] in 1581. In 1584 he took his seat in [[Parliament of England|parliament]] for [[Melcombe Regis (UK Parliament constituency)|Melcombe]] in Dorset, and in 1586 for [[Taunton (UK Parliament constituency)|Taunton]]. At this time, he began to write on the condition of parties in the church, as well as on the topic of philosophical reform in the lost tract ''Temporis Partus Maximus''. Yet he failed to gain a position that he thought would lead him to success.{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=136}} He showed signs of sympathy to Puritanism, attending the sermons of the Puritan chaplain of Gray's Inn and accompanying his mother to the [[Temple Church]] to hear [[Walter Travers]]. This led to the publication of his earliest surviving tract, which criticised the English church's suppression of the Puritan clergy. In the Parliament of 1586, he openly urged execution for the Catholic [[Mary, Queen of Scots]].

About this time, he again approached his powerful uncle for help; this move was followed by his rapid progress at the bar. He became a [[bencher]] in 1586 and was elected a [[Reader (Inns of Court)|Reader]] in 1587, delivering his first set of lectures in Lent the following year. In 1589, he received the valuable appointment of [[Reversion (law)|reversion]] to the Clerkship of the [[Star Chamber]], although he did not formally take office until 1608; the post was worth £1,600 a year.{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=136}}{{sfnp|Peltonen|2007}}

In 1588 he became MP for [[Liverpool (UK Parliament constituency)|Liverpool]] and then for [[Middlesex (UK Parliament constituency)|Middlesex]] in 1593. He later sat three times for [[Ipswich (UK Parliament constituency)|Ipswich]] (1597, 1601, 1604) and once for [[Cambridge University (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridge University]] (1614).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1558-1603/member/bacon-francis-1561-1626 |title=History of Parliament |accessdate=2 October 2011}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

He became known as a liberal-minded reformer, eager to amend and simplify the law. Though a friend of the crown, he opposed feudal privileges and dictatorial powers. He spoke against religious persecution. He struck at the House of Lords in its usurpation of the Money Bills. He advocated for the union of England and Scotland, which made him a significant influence toward the consolidation of the United Kingdom; and he later would advocate for the integration of Ireland into the Union. Closer constitutional ties, he believed, would bring greater peace and strength to these countries.&lt;ref name="letters"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Spedding |first=James |title=The letters and life of Francis Bacon |year=1861 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ecc.015"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://publish.ucc.ie/celt/docs/E600001-015 |title=Sir Francis Bacon's Letters, Tracts and Speech relating to Ireland |work= |publisher= |deadurl=no |archivedate=2011-08-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807142316/http://publish.ucc.ie/celt/docs/E600001-015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final years of the Queen's reign===
Bacon soon became acquainted with [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex]], Queen Elizabeth's favourite.&lt;ref name="Hammer"/&gt; By 1591 he acted as the earl's confidential adviser.{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=136}}&lt;ref name="Hammer"&gt;Paul E. J. Hammer (1999). "The Polarisation of Elizabethan Politics: The Political Career of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, 1585–1597". p. 141. Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1592 he was commissioned to write a tract in response to the Jesuit [[Robert Parsons (Jesuit)|Robert Parson]]'s anti-government polemic, which he titled ''Certain observations made upon a libel'', identifying England with the ideals of democratic [[History of Athens|Athens]] against the belligerence of Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Gustav Ungerer (1974). "A Spaniard in Elizabethan England: The Correspondence of Antonio Pérez's Exile, Volume 1". p. 207. Tamesis Books&lt;/ref&gt;

Bacon took his third parliamentary seat for [[Middlesex]] when in February 1593 Elizabeth summoned Parliament to investigate a Roman Catholic plot against her. Bacon's opposition to a bill that would levy triple subsidies in half the usual time offended the Queen: opponents accused him of seeking popularity, and for a time the Court excluded him from favour.&lt;ref&gt;Weir, Alison  ''Elizabeth the Queen'' Pimlico 1999 p. 414&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:StatueOfFrancisBacon.jpg|thumb|Memorial to Francis Bacon, in the chapel of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]]]

When the office of [[Attorney-General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] fell vacant in 1594, Lord Essex's influence was not enough to secure the position for Bacon and it was given to Sir [[Edward Coke]]. Likewise, Bacon failed to secure the lesser office of [[Solicitor-General for England and Wales|Solicitor General]] in 1595, the Queen pointedly snubbing him by appointing Sir [[Thomas Fleming (judge)|Thomas Fleming]] instead.{{sfnp|Peltonen|2007}} To console him for these disappointments, Essex presented him with a property at [[Twickenham]], which Bacon subsequently sold for £1,800.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bunten|first1=Alice Chambers|title=Twickenham Park and Old Richmond Palace and Francis Bacon: Lord Verulam's Connection with The, 1580–1608|publisher=R. Banks|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1597 Bacon became the first [[Queen's Counsel]] designate, when Queen Elizabeth reserved him as her legal counsel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of English Law|last=Holdsworth|first=W.S.|publisher=|year=1938|isbn=|location=|pages=vi 473–474}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1597, he was also given a patent, giving him precedence at the Bar.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Patent Rolls]]'', 2 Jac I p. 12 m 10.&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite his designations, he was unable to gain the status and notoriety of others. In a plan to revive his position he unsuccessfully courted the wealthy and young widow Lady [[Elizabeth Hatton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Curious Case of Lady Purbeck; A Scandal of the XVIIth Century|last=Longueville|first=Thomas|publisher=Longmans, Green and Co|year=1909|isbn=|location=London|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; His courtship failed after she broke off their relationship upon accepting marriage to Sir Edward Coke, a further spark of enmity between the men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aughterson|first=Kate|date=|title=Hatton, Elizabeth, Lady Hatton [nee Lady Elizabeth Cecil] (1578–1646)|url=|journal=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|volume=|pages=|via=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1598 Bacon was arrested for debt. Afterward, however, his standing in the Queen's eyes improved. Gradually, Bacon earned the standing of one of the learned counsels.{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=137}} His relationship with the Queen further improved when he severed ties with Essex{{mdash}}a shrewd move, as Essex would be executed for treason in 1601.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Britannica Concise Encyclopedia|date= 2008|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc.|page=636}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With others, Bacon was appointed to investigate the charges against Essex. A number of Essex's followers confessed that Essex had planned a rebellion against the Queen.&lt;ref name="Character Assassination"&gt;Nieves Matthews, ''Francis Bacon: The History of a Character Assassination'' (Yale University Press, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;  Bacon was subsequently a part of the legal team headed by the [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] Sir Edward Coke at Essex's treason trial.&lt;ref name="Character Assassination" /&gt; After the execution, the Queen ordered Bacon to write the official government account of the trial, which was later published as ''A DECLARATION of the Practices and Treasons attempted and committed by Robert late Earle of Essex and his Complices, against her Majestie and her Kingdoms ...'' after Bacon's first draft was heavily edited by the Queen and her ministers.{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=138}}&lt;ref&gt;Matthews (1996: 56–57)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to his personal secretary and chaplain, [[William Rawley]], as a judge Bacon was always tender-hearted, "looking upon the examples with the eye of severity, but upon the person with the eye of pity and compassion". And also that "he was free from malice", "no revenger of injuries", and "no defamer of any man".&lt;ref name="Rawley"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rawley |first=William |title=The Life of the Right Honorable Francis Bacon Baron of Verulam, Viscount ST.

===James I comes to the throne===
The succession of [[James I of England|James I]] brought Bacon into greater favour. He was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in 1603. In another shrewd move, Bacon wrote his ''Apologies'' in defence of his proceedings in the case of Essex, as Essex had favoured James to succeed to the throne.

The following year, during the course of the uneventful first parliament session, Bacon married [[Alice Barnham]].{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=139}} In June 1607 he was at last rewarded with the office of solicitor general.{{sfnp|Peltonen|2007}} The following year, he began working as the Clerkship of the [[Star Chamber]]. Despite a generous income, old debts still could not be paid. He sought further promotion and wealth by supporting King James and his arbitrary policies.

In 1610 the fourth session of James's first [[James I of England and the English Parliament|parliament]] met. Despite Bacon's advice to him, James and the Commons found themselves at odds over royal prerogatives and the king's embarrassing extravagance. The House was finally dissolved in February 1611. Throughout this period Bacon managed to stay in the favour of the king while retaining the confidence of the Commons.

In 1613 Bacon was finally appointed [[Attorney General for England and Wales|attorney general]], after advising the king to shuffle judicial appointments. As attorney general, Bacon, by his zealous efforts—which included torture—to obtain the conviction of Edmund Peacham for treason, raised legal controversies of high constitutional importance;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Peacham,_Edmond_(DNB00)|title=The Dictionary of National Biography|last=Lee|first=Sidney|publisher=[[Smith, Elder &amp; Co]]|year=1895|isbn=|volume=44|location=|pages=|chapter=Peachem, Edmond|author-link=Sidney Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt; and successfully prosecuted [[Robert Carr, 1st Earl of Somerset]], and his wife, [[Frances Howard, Countess of Somerset]], for murder in 1616. The so-called Prince's Parliament of April 1614 objected to Bacon's presence in the seat for [[University of Cambridge (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridge]] and to the various royal plans that Bacon had supported. Although he was allowed to stay, parliament passed a law that forbade the attorney general to sit in parliament. His influence over the king had evidently inspired resentment or apprehension in many of his peers. Bacon, however, continued to receive the King's favour, which led to his appointment in March 1617 as temporary Regent of England (for a period of a month), and in 1618 as [[Lord Chancellor]]. On 12 July 1618 the king created Bacon '''[[Baron Verulam]]''', of [[Verulamium|Verulam]], in the [[Peerage of England]];  he then became known as Francis, Lord Verulam.{{sfnp|Peltonen|2007}}

Bacon continued to use his influence with the king to mediate between the throne and Parliament, and in this capacity he was further elevated in the same peerage, as '''[[Viscount St Alban]]''', on 27 January 1621.

===Lord Chancellor and public disgrace===
[[File:Bacon vs Parliament.jpg|thumb|Francis Bacon and the members of the Parliament on the day of his political fall]]

Bacon's public career ended in disgrace in 1621. After he fell into debt, a parliamentary committee on the administration of the law charged him with 23 separate counts of corruption. His lifelong enemy, Sir [[Edward Coke]], who had instigated these accusations,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Ian |last=Ousby |year=1996 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=43oBE1nJXaMC |title=The Cambridge Paperback Guide to Literature in English |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=22 |postscript=. }}&lt;/ref&gt; was one of those appointed to prepare the charges against the chancellor.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Perez |last=Zagorin |year=1999 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IoKwR_8FBYcC |title=Francis Bacon |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=22 |postscript=. }}&lt;/ref&gt; To the lords, who sent a committee to enquire whether a confession was really his, he replied, "My lords, it is my act, my hand, and my heart; I beseech your lordships to be merciful to a broken reed." He was sentenced to a fine of £40,000 and committed to the [[Tower of London]] at the king's pleasure; the imprisonment lasted only a few days and the fine was remitted by the king.&lt;ref name="mpkm"&gt;{{cite book |last=Parris |first=Matthew |author1-link=Matthew Parris |author2-link=Kevin Maguire (journalist) |last2=Maguire |first2=Kevin |title=Great Parliamentary Scandals |publisher=Chrysalis|location=London|year=2004|pages=8–9|chapter=Francis Bacon – 1621 |isbn=978-1-86105-736-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More seriously, parliament declared Bacon incapable of holding future office or sitting in parliament. He narrowly escaped undergoing [[Cashiering|degradation]], which would have stripped him of his titles of nobility. Subsequently, the disgraced viscount devoted himself to study and writing.

There seems little doubt that Bacon had accepted gifts from litigants, but this was an accepted custom of the time and not necessarily evidence of deeply corrupt behaviour.&lt;ref name="pz"&gt;{{cite book |last=Zagorin |first=Perez |authorlink=Perez Zagorin |title=Francis Bacon |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, NJ |year=1999 |pages=22–23 |isbn=978-0-691-00966-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While acknowledging that his conduct had been lax, he countered that he had never allowed gifts to influence his judgement and, indeed, he had on occasion given a verdict against those who had paid him. He even had an interview with King James in which he assured:
{{Quote |The law of nature teaches me to speak in my own defence: With respect to this charge of bribery I am as innocent as any man born on St. Innocents Day. I never had a bribe or reward in my eye or thought when pronouncing judgment or order... I am ready to make an oblation of myself to the King|17 April 1621&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, John; Baron Campbell (1818), J. Murray. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=8GMoAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA404 The Lives of the Lord Chancellors and Keepers of the Great Seal of England]"&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He also wrote the following to Buckingham:
{{Quote |My mind is calm, for my fortune is not my felicity. I know I have clean hands and a clean heart, and I hope a clean house for friends or servants; but Job himself, or whoever was the justest judge, by such hunting for matters against him as hath been used against me, may for a time seem foul, especially in a time when greatness is the mark and accusation is the game.{{sfn|Fowler|1885|p=347}} }}

The true reason for his acknowledgement of guilt is the subject of debate, but some authors speculate that it may have been prompted by his sickness, or by a view that through his fame and the greatness of his office he would be spared harsh punishment.  He may even have been blackmailed, with a threat to charge him with sodomy, into confession.&lt;ref name="pz" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[A. L. Rowse]], quoted in Parris; Maguire (2004: 8): "a charge of sodomy was... to be brought against the sixty-year-old Lord Chancellor".&lt;/ref&gt;

The British jurist [[Basil Montagu]] wrote in Bacon's defence, concerning the episode of his public disgrace:
{{Quote |Bacon has been accused of servility, of dissimulation, of various base motives, and their filthy brood of base actions, all unworthy of his high birth, and incompatible with his great wisdom, and the estimation in which he was held by the noblest spirits of the age. It is true that there were men in his own time, and will be men in all times, who are better pleased to count spots in the sun than to rejoice in its glorious brightness. Such men have openly libelled him, like Dewes and Weldon, whose falsehoods were detected as soon as uttered, or have fastened upon certain ceremonious compliments and dedications, the fashion of his day, as a sample of his servility, passing over his noble letters to the Queen, his lofty contempt for the Lord Keeper Puckering, his open dealing with Sir Robert Cecil, and with others, who, powerful when he was nothing, might have blighted his opening fortunes for ever, forgetting his advocacy of the rights of the people in the face of the court, and the true and honest counsels, always given by him, in times of great difficulty, both to Elizabeth and her successor. When was a "base sycophant" loved and honoured by piety such as that of Herbert, Tennison, and Rawley, by noble spirits like Hobbes, Ben Jonson, and Selden, or followed to the grave, and beyond it, with devoted affection such as that of Sir Thomas Meautys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Montagu |first=Basil |title=Essays and Selections |year=1837 |isbn=978-1-4368-3777-4 |pages=325–326 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Personal life===

====Religious beliefs====
Bacon was a devout [[Anglican]]. He believed that philosophy and the natural world must be studied inductively, but argued that we can only study arguments for the existence of God. Information on His attributes (such as nature, action, and purposes) can only come from special revelation. But Bacon also held that knowledge was cumulative, that study encompassed more than a simple preservation of the past. "Knowledge is the rich storehouse for the glory of the Creator and the relief of man's estate," he wrote. In his Essays, he affirms that "a little philosophy inclineth man's mind to atheism, but depth in philosophy bringeth men's minds about to religion."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.christianitytoday.com/history/people/scholarsandscientists/francis-bacon.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Bacon's idea of [[Novum Organum#The Idols (Idola)|idols of the mind]] may have self-consciously represented an attempt to Christianize science at the same time as developing a new, reliable scientific method; Bacon gave worship of [[Neptune]] as an example of the [[idola tribus]] fallacy, hinting at the religious dimensions of his critique of the idols.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 | pages=48–49 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | ISBN = 0-226-40336-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Marriage to Alice Barnham====
When he was 36, Bacon courted [[Elizabeth Hatton]], a young widow of 20. Reportedly, she broke off their relationship upon accepting marriage to a wealthier man, Bacon's rival, Sir [[Edward Coke]]. Years later, Bacon still wrote of his regret that the marriage to Hatton had not taken place.&lt;ref name=Dodd-Life-Story&gt;Alfred Dodd, ''Francis Bacon's Personal Life Story', Volume 2 – The Age of James'', England: Rider &amp; Co., 1949, 1986. pp. 157–158, 425, 502–503, 518–532&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 45, Bacon married [[Alice Barnham]], the 14-year-old daughter of a well-connected London [[alderman]] and MP. Bacon wrote two sonnets proclaiming his love for Alice. The first was written during his courtship and the second on his wedding day, 10 May 1606. When Bacon was appointed lord chancellor, "by special Warrant of the King", Lady Bacon was given precedence over all other Court ladies. Bacon's personal secretary and chaplain, William Rawley, wrote in his biography of Bacon that his marriage was one of "much conjugal love and respect", mentioning a robe of honour that he gave to Alice and which "she wore unto her dying day, being twenty years and more after his death".&lt;ref name="Rawley" /&gt;

[[File:Alice Barnham.gif|thumb|Engraving of [[Alice Barnham]]]]

However, an increasing number of reports circulated about friction in the marriage, with speculation that this may have been due to Alice's making do with less money than she had once been accustomed to. It was said that she was strongly interested in fame and fortune, and when household finances dwindled, she complained bitterly. Bunten wrote in her ''Life of Alice Barnham''&lt;ref&gt;Alice Chambers Bunten, ''Life of Alice Barnham, Wife of Sir Francis Bacon'', London: Oliphants Ltd. 1928.&lt;/ref&gt; that, upon their descent into debt, she went on trips to ask for financial favours and assistance from their circle of friends. Bacon disinherited her upon discovering her secret romantic relationship with [[Sir John Underhill]]. He subsequently rewrote his will, which had previously been very generous{{mdash}}leaving her lands, goods, and income{{mdash}}and instead revoked it all.

====Homosexuality====

Several authors believe that despite his marriage Bacon was primarily attracted to the same sex.&lt;ref&gt;A. L. Rowse, ''Homosexuals in History'', New York: Carroll &amp; Garf, 1977. p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jardine, Lisa; Stewart, Alan ''Hostage To Fortune: The Troubled Life of Francis Bacon'' Hill &amp; Wang, 1999. p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; Forker,&lt;ref&gt;Charles R. Forker,  "'Masculine Love', Renaissance Writing, and the 'New Invention' of Homosexuality: An Addendum" in the ''Journal of Homosexuality'' (1996), Indiana University&lt;/ref&gt; for example, has explored the "historically documentable sexual preferences" of both Francis Bacon and King James I and concluded they were both orientated to "masculine love", a contemporary term that "seems to have been used exclusively to refer to the sexual preference of men for members of their own gender."&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of Homosexuality'', Volume: 31 Issue: 3, 1996, pp. 85–93, {{ISSN|0091-8369}}&lt;/ref&gt; The well-connected antiquary [[John Aubrey]] noted in his ''[[Brief Lives]]'' concerning Bacon, "He was a [[Pederast]]. His [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganimeds]] and Favourites tooke Bribes".&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Lawson Dick, ed. ''Aubrey's Brief Lives. Edited from the Original Manuscripts'', 1949, ''s.v.'' "Francis Bacon, Viscount of St. Albans" p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The Jacobean antiquarian, Sir [[Simonds D'Ewes]] implied there had been a question of bringing him to trial for buggery,&lt;ref&gt;Fulton Anderson, ''Francis Bacon: His career and his thought'', Los Angeles, 1962&lt;/ref&gt; which his brother Anthony Bacon had also been charged with.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Golden Lads: A Study of Anthony Bacon, Francis and Their Friends|last = du Maurier|first = Daphne|publisher = Gollancz|year = 1975|isbn = 978-1844080731|location = London|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This conclusion has been disputed by others, who point to lack of consistent evidence, and consider the sources to be more open to interpretation.&lt;ref name="Character Assassination" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ross Jackson, ''The Companion to Shaker of the Speare: The Francis Bacon Story'', England: Book Guild Publishing, 2005. pp. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Bryan Bevan, ''The Real Francis Bacon'', England: Centaur Press, 1960&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helen Veale, ''Son of England'', India: Indo Polish Library, 1950&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Dawkins, ''Dedication to the Light'', England: Francis Bacon Research Trust, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;  Publicly, at least, Bacon distanced himself from the idea of homosexuality. In his ''[[New Atlantis]]'', he described his [[utopian]] island as being "the chastest nation under heaven", and "as for [[Homosexuality|masculine love]], they have no touch of it".&lt;ref name="Atlantis1627"&gt;Bacon, Francis. ''The New Atlantis''. 1627&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
[[File:20040912-001-francis-bacon.jpg|thumb|Monument to Bacon at his burial place, [[St. Michael's Church, St. Albans|St Michael's Church]] in [[St Albans]]]]

On 9 April 1626, Francis Bacon died of [[pneumonia]] while at Arundel mansion at [[Highgate]] outside London.&lt;ref name="death"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Broadview Anthology of Seventeenth-Century Prose|date=21 Mar 2001|publisher=Broadview Press|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; An influential account of the circumstances of his death was given by [[John Aubrey]]'s ''[[Brief Lives]]''.&lt;ref name="death"/&gt; Aubrey's vivid account, which portrays Bacon as a martyr to experimental scientific method, had him journeying to Highgate through the snow with the King's physician when he is suddenly inspired by the possibility of using the snow to preserve meat:&lt;blockquote&gt;They were resolved they would try the experiment presently. They alighted out of the coach and went into a poor woman's house at the bottom of Highgate hill, and bought a fowl, and made the woman [[wiktionary:exenterate|exenterate]] it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After stuffing the fowl with snow, Bacon contracted a fatal case of [[pneumonia]]. Some people, including Aubrey, consider these two contiguous, possibly coincidental events as related and causative of his death:&lt;blockquote&gt;The Snow so chilled him that he immediately fell so extremely ill, that he could not return to his Lodging … but went to the Earle of Arundel's house at Highgate, where they put him into … a damp bed that had not been layn-in … which gave him such a cold that in 2 or 3 days as I remember Mr Hobbes told me, he died of Suffocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bowen|first1=Catherine|title=Francis Bacon: The Temper of a Man|date=1 January 1993|publisher=Fordham University Press|page=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Aubrey has been criticised for his evident credulousness in this and other works; on the other hand, he knew [[Thomas Hobbes]], Bacon's fellow-philosopher and friend.

Being unwittingly on his deathbed, the philosopher wrote his last letter to his absent host and friend [[Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel|Lord Arundel]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;My very good Lord,—I was likely to have had the fortune of [[Pliny the Elder|Caius Plinius the elder]], who lost his life by trying an experiment about the burning of [[Mount Vesuvius]]; for I was also desirous to try an experiment or two touching the conservation and induration of bodies. As for the experiment itself, it succeeded excellently well; but in the journey between London and Highgate, I was taken with such a fit of [[Cough|casting]] as I know not whether it were the Stone, or some surfeit or cold, or indeed a touch of them all three.  But when I came to your Lordship's House, I was not able to go back, and therefore was forced to take up my lodging here, where your housekeeper is very careful and diligent about me, which I assure myself your Lordship will not only pardon towards him, but think the better of him for it.  For indeed your Lordship's House was happy to me, and I kiss your noble hands for the welcome which I am sure you give me to it. I know how unfit it is for me to write with any other hand than mine own, but by my troth my fingers are so disjointed with sickness that I cannot steadily hold a pen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bacon |first=Francis |title=The Works of Francis Bacon, Lord Chancellor of England |edition=new |editor-first=Basil |editor-last=Montagu |editor-link=Basil Montagu |place=London |year=1825–34 |ref=harv |postscript=. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{anchor |William Rawley}}Another account appears in a biography by William Rawley, Bacon's personal secretary and chaplain:&lt;blockquote&gt;He died on the ninth day of April in the year 1626, in the early morning of the day then celebrated for our Saviour's resurrection, in the sixty-sixth year of his age, at the Earl of Arundel's house in Highgate, near London, to which place he casually repaired about a week before; God so ordaining that he should die there of a gentle fever, accidentally accompanied with a great cold, whereby the defluxion of [[rheum]] fell so plentifully upon his breast, that he died by suffocation.&lt;ref name="Rawley-bio"&gt;{{citation |last=Rawley |first=William (Bacon's personal secretary and chaplain) |title=Resuscitatio, or, Bringing into Publick Light Several Pieces of the Works, Civil, Historical, Philosophical, &amp; Theological, Hitherto Sleeping; of the Right Honourable Francis Bacon.  ...Together with his Lordship's Life |year=1657 |quote=Francis Bacon, the glory of his age and nation, the adorner and ornament of learning, was born in York House, or York Place, in the Strand, on the two and twentieth day of January, in the year of our Lord 1560. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He was buried in [[St. Michael's Church, St. Albans|St Michael's church]] in St Albans. At the news of his death, over 30 great minds collected together their eulogies of him, which were then later published in Latin.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |editor-first=W.G.C. |editor-last=Gundry |title=Manes Verulamani}} This important volume consists of 32 eulogies originally published in Latin shortly after Bacon's funeral in 1626.

===Science===
Bacon's seminal work ''[[Novum Organum]]'' was influential in the 1630s and 1650s among scholars, in particular Sir [[Thomas Browne]], who in his encyclopedia ''[[Pseudodoxia Epidemica]]'' (1646–72) frequently adheres to a Baconian approach to his scientific enquiries. This book entails the basis of the Scientific Method as a means of observation and induction. During the [[English Restoration|Restoration]], Bacon was commonly invoked as a guiding spirit of the [[Royal Society]] founded under Charles II in 1660.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Julian |last=Martin |title=Francis Bacon: The State and the Reform of Natural Philosophy |year=1992 |place=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|ISBN=9780521382496 }}{{Page needed|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Byron |last=Steel |title=Sir Francis Bacon: The First Modern Mind |place=Garden City, NY |publisher=Doubleday, Doran &amp; Co |year=1930 |ref=harv |postscript=. }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 18th-century [[French Enlightenment]], Bacon's non-metaphysical approach to science became more influential than the dualism of his French contemporary [[Descartes]], and was associated with criticism of the ''[[ancien regime]]''. In 1733 [[Voltaire]] introduced him to a French audience as the "father" of the [[scientific method]], an understanding which had become widespread by the 1750s.&lt;ref&gt;Hundert, EJ. (1987), "Enlightenment and the decay of common sense." In: Frits van Holthoon &amp; David R. Olson (Eds.), ''Common Sense: The Foundations for Social Science'' (pp. 133–154). Lanham, MD: University Press of America. p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century his emphasis on [[Induction (philosophy)|induction]] was revived and developed by [[William Whewell]], among others. He has been reputed as the "Father of Experimental Philosophy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Peter |last=Urbach |title=Francis Bacon's Philosophy of Science: An Account and a Reappraisal |publisher=Open Court Publishing Co |place=La Salle, Ill.|year=1987|ISBN=9780912050447}} p. 192. "Bacon's celebrity as a philosopher of science has sunk since the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, when he earned the title of 'Father of Experimental Philosophy{{' "}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

He also wrote a long treatise on Medicine, ''History of Life and Death'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bacon |first=Francis |title=History of Life and Death |url=https://books.google.com/?id=dW5lJ9-LeBAC |isbn=978-0-7661-6272-3 |date=1 June 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with natural and experimental observations for the prolongation of life.

One of his biographers, the historian [[William Hepworth Dixon]], states: "Bacon's influence in the modern world is so great that every man who rides in a train, sends a telegram, follows a [[steam plough]], sits in an easy chair, crosses the channel or the Atlantic, eats a good dinner, enjoys a beautiful garden, or undergoes a painless surgical operation, owes him something."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hepworth Dixon |first=William |title="The story of Lord Bacon's Life" (1862) |url=https://books.google.com/?id=zd05AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=the+story+of+lord+bacon's+life+hepworth+dixon|year=1862 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1902 [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]] published a fictional letter, known as ''[[The Lord Chandos Letter]]'', addressed to Bacon and dated 1603, about a writer who is experiencing a crisis of language.

===North America===
[[File:Lord Bacon - the guiding spirit of colonization scheme.jpg|thumb|upright|A Newfoundland stamp, which reads "Lord Bacon – the guiding spirit in colonization scheme"]]

Bacon played a leading role in establishing the [[British colonies in North America]], especially in [[Virginia]], [[the Carolinas]] and [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] in northeastern Canada. His government report on "The Virginia Colony" was submitted in 1609. In 1610 Bacon and his associates received a charter from the king to form ''the Tresurer and the Companye of Adventurers and planter of the Cittye of London and Bristoll for the Collonye or plantacon in Newfoundland'', and sent [[John Guy (governor)|John Guy]] to found a colony there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/law/lab4/labvol4_1701.html |year=1701 |volume=4 |place=NF, [[Canada|CA]] |publisher=Heritage |title=Lab |type=law |ref=harv |postscript=. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021163440/http://www.heritage.nf.ca/law/lab4/labvol4_1701.html |archivedate=21 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Jefferson]], the third President of the United States, wrote: "Bacon, [[John Locke|Locke]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]].

In 1910 Newfoundland issued a postage stamp to commemorate Bacon's role in establishing the colony. The stamp describes Bacon as "the guiding spirit in Colonization Schemes in 1610".&lt;ref name="Dodd-Life-Story" /&gt; Moreover, some scholars believe he was largely responsible for the drafting, in 1609 and 1612, of two charters of government for the Virginia Colony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.fbrt.org.uk/pages/essays/essay-fb-life.html |type=essay |title=FB life |publisher=FBRT |place=UK |ref=harv |postscript=. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131131208/http://www.fbrt.org.uk/pages/essays/essay-fb-life.html |archivedate=31 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; William Hepworth Dixon considered that Bacon's name could be included in the list of Founders of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hepworth Dixon |first=William |title=Personal History of Lord Bacon from Unpublished Papers |page=200 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=BE4dalMQX-cC&amp;lpg=PA200&amp;dq=the%20people%20of%20the%20Great%20Republic%20would%20give%20the%20great%20and%20august%20name%20of%20Bacon%20to%20one%20of%20their%20splendid%20cities&amp;pg=PA200#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-7661-2798-2 |date=1 February 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law===
Although few of his proposals for law reform were adopted during his lifetime, Bacon's legal legacy was considered by the magazine ''[[New Scientist]]'' in 1961 as having influenced the drafting of the [[Napoleonic Code]] as well as the law reforms introduced by 19th-century British Prime Minister [[Sir Robert Peel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Crowther |first=J.G. |title=Article about Francis Bacon |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ODBtWGjxXH8C&amp;pg=PA146&amp;dq=francis+bacon+napoleon+code&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DY0sT9KBG4Pv0gHrpqTRCg&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |work=New Scientist |date=19 January 1961 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[William Hepworth Dixon]] referred to the Napoleonic Code as "the sole embodiment of Bacon's thought", saying that Bacon's legal work "has had more success abroad than it has found at home", and that in France "it has blossomed and come into fruit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hepworth Dixon |first=William |title=Personal history of Lord Bacon: From unpublished papers |year=1861 |page=35 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=CGbaQ-oqtxQC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harvey Wheeler]] attributed to Bacon, in ''Francis Bacon's Verulamium{{mdash}}the Common Law Template of The Modern in English Science and Culture'', the creation of these distinguishing features of the modern [[common law]] system:
*  using cases as repositories of evidence about the "unwritten law";
*  determining the relevance of precedents by exclusionary principles of evidence and logic; 
*  treating opposing legal briefs as adversarial hypotheses about the application of the "unwritten law" to a new set of facts.

As late as the 18th century some juries still declared the law rather than the facts, but already before the end of the 17th century [[Sir Matthew Hale]] explained modern common law adjudication procedure and acknowledged Bacon as the inventor of the process of discovering unwritten laws from the evidences of their applications.  The method combined empiricism and inductivism in a new way that was to imprint its signature on many of the distinctive features of modern [[English society]].&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, Harvey. ''Francis Bacon's 'Verulamium': the Common Law Template of The Modern in English Science and Culture''&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Paul H. Kocher]] writes that Bacon is considered by some jurists to be the father of modern [[Jurisprudence]].&lt;ref name="Jurisprudence"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kocher |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul H. Kocher |year=1957 |title=Francis Bacon and the Science of Jurisprudence |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |location=Philadelphia|volume=8 |pages=3–26 |doi=10.2307/2707577 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bacon is commemorated with a statue in [[Gray's Inn]], South Square in London where he received his legal training, and where he was elected Treasurer of the Inn in 1608.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.graysinn.org.uk/history/timeline/sir-francis-bacon "Sir Francis Bacon"]. GraysInn.org. Retrieved 21 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt; James McClellan, a political scientist from the [[University of Virginia]], considered Bacon to have had "a great following" in the [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]].&lt;ref name="McClellan"&gt;{{cite journal |last=McClellan |first=James |title=The Common Law Tradition – Liberty, Order, and Justice: an Introduction to the Constitutional Principles of American Government |year=1989 |url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Fperson=3822&amp;Itemid=27 |publisher=Liberty Fund |ref=harv |postscript=. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent scholarship on Bacon's jurisprudence has focused on his advocating torture as a legal recourse for the crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hanson |first=Elizabeth |title=Torture and Truth in Renaissance England |journal=Representations |date=Spring 1991 |volume=34 |pages=53–84 |doi=10.1525/rep.1991.34.1.99p0046u |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bacon himself was not a stranger to the torture chamber: in his various legal capacities in both Elizabeth I's and James I's reigns, Bacon was listed as a commissioner on five torture warrants. In 1613(?), in a letter addressed to King James I on the question of torture's place within English law, Bacon identifies the scope of torture as a means to further the investigation of threats to the state: "In the cases of treasons, torture is used for discovery, and not for evidence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Langbein |first=John H. |title=Torture and the Law of Proof |year=1976 |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |page=90 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For Bacon, torture was not a punitive measure, an intended form of state repression, but instead offered a modus operandi for the government agent tasked with uncovering acts of treason.

===Organization of knowledge===
Francis Bacon developed the idea that a classification of knowledge must be universal while handling all possible resources. In his progressive view, humanity would be better if the access to educational resources were provided to the public. Hence the need to organize it. His approach to learning reshaped the Western view of our knowledge theory from an individual to a social interest. &lt;br&gt;
The original classification proposed by Bacon organized all types of knowledge in three general groups: history, poetry, and philosophy. He did that based on his understanding of how we process information: Memory, Imagination, and Reason, respectively. His methodical approach to the categorization of knowledge goes hand in hand with his principles of scientific methods. &lt;br&gt;
We owe Bacon, not only his inductive approach to science, but his efforts to bring his meticulous and systematic vision to the organization of information which was the platform for further research and advancement for centuries after him.&lt;br&gt;
Bacon’s writings were the starting point for [[William_Torrey_Harris|William Torrey Harris]] classification system for libraries in the United States by the second half of the 1800s.

==Historical debates==

===Bacon and Shakespeare===
{{main|Baconian theory|Bacon's cipher}}

The Baconian hypothesis of [[Shakespearean authorship]], first proposed in the mid-19th century, contends that Francis Bacon wrote some or even all of the plays conventionally attributed to [[William Shakespeare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dobson|first1=Michael|title=The Oxford Companion to Shakespeare|date=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Occult theories ===
{{main|Occult theories about Francis Bacon}}
Francis Bacon often gathered with the men at Gray's Inn to discuss politics and philosophy, and to try out various theatrical scenes that he admitted writing.&lt;ref&gt;Frances Yates, ''Theatre of the World'', London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; Bacon's alleged connection to the [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucians]] and the [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]] has been widely discussed by authors and scholars in many books.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; However, others, including [[Daphne du Maurier]] in her biography of Bacon, have argued that there is no substantive evidence to support claims of involvement with the Rosicrucians.&lt;ref&gt;Daphne du Maurier, ''The Winding Stair, Biography of Bacon'' 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frances Yates]]&lt;ref&gt;Frances Yates, ''The Occult Philosophy in the Elizabethan Age'', pp. 61–68, London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; does not make the claim that Bacon was a Rosicrucian, but presents evidence that he was nevertheless involved in some of the more closed intellectual movements of his day. She argues that Bacon's movement for the advancement of learning was closely connected with the German Rosicrucian movement, while Bacon's ''New Atlantis'' portrays a land ruled by Rosicrucians. He apparently saw his own movement for the advancement of learning to be in conformity with Rosicrucian ideals.&lt;ref name="Yates"&gt;Frances Yates, ''The Rosicrucian Enlightenment'', London and Boston: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bacon-Rose.jpg|thumb|An old volume of Francis Bacon and a rose]]
The link between Bacon's work and the Rosicrucians' ideals which Yates allegedly found was the conformity of the purposes expressed by the [[Rosicrucian Manifestos]] and Bacon's plan of a "Great Instauration",&lt;ref name="Yates" /&gt; for the two were calling for a reformation of both "divine and human understanding",&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;"Howbeit we know after a time there wil now be '''a general reformation, both of divine and humane things''', according to our desire, and the expectation of others: for it's fitting, that before the rising of the Sun, there should appear and break forth Aurora, or some clearness, or divine light in the sky" – [[Fama Fraternitatis]] [http://www.sacred-texts.com/sro/rhr/rhr06.htm sacred-texts.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:The Advancement of Learning|Bacon, Francis. Of the Proficience and Advancement of Learning, Divine and Human]]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as both had in view the purpose of mankind's return to the "state before the Fall".&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;"Like good and faithful guardians, we may yield up their fortune to mankind upon the emancipation and majority of their understanding, from which must necessarily follow an improvement of their estate [...]. For man, by the fall, fell at the same time from his state of innocency and from his dominion over creation. Both of these losses however can even in this life be in some part repaired; the former by religion and faith, the latter by arts and sciences. – Francis Bacon, [[s:Novum Organum|Novum Organum]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;"We ought therefore here to observe well, and make it known unto everyone, that God hath certainly and most assuredly concluded to send and grant to the whole world before her end ... such a truth, light, life, and glory, as the first man Adam had, which he lost in Paradise, after which his successors were put and driven, with him, to misery. Wherefore there shall cease all servitude, falsehood, lies, and darkness, which by little and little, with the great world's revolution, was crept into all arts, works, and governments of men, and have darkened most part of them".  – [[Confessio Fraternitatis]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major link is said to be the resemblance between Bacon's ''New Atlantis'' and the German Rosicrucian [[Johann Valentin Andreae]]'s ''Description of the Republic of Christianopolis'' (1619).{{sfnp|Andreae|1619}}  Andreae describes a utopic island in which Christian [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|theosophy]] and applied science ruled, and in which the spiritual fulfilment and intellectual activity constituted the primary goals of each individual, the scientific pursuits being the highest intellectual calling{{mdash}}linked to the achievement of spiritual perfection. Andreae's island also depicts a great advancement in technology, with many industries separated in different zones which supplied the population's needs{{mdash}}which shows great resemblance to Bacon's scientific methods and purposes.&lt;ref name="Farrington"&gt;{{cite book |last=Farrington |first=Benjamin |title=Francis Bacon, philosopher of industrial science |year=1951 |isbn=978-0-374-92706-6 |ref=harv |postscript=. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Literary criticism of Johann Valentin Andreae |url=http://www.enotes.com/johann-valentin-andreae-criticism/andreae-johann-valentin |publisher=Enotes.com |accessdate=21 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While rejecting occult [[conspiracy theories]] surrounding Bacon and the claim Bacon personally identified as a Rosicrucian, intellectual historian Paolo Rossi has argued for an occult influence on Bacon's scientific and religious writing. He argues that Bacon was familiar with early modern [[Alchemy|alchemical]] texts and that Bacon's ideas about the application of science had roots in Renaissance magical ideas about science and magic facilitating humanity's domination of nature.&lt;ref name="Rossi 1968, Chapter 1"&gt;Rossi (1968), Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; Rossi further interprets Bacon's search for hidden meanings in myth and fables in such texts as ''The Wisdom of the Ancients'' as succeeding earlier occultist and [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] attempts to locate hidden wisdom in pre-Christian myths.&lt;ref&gt;Rossi (1968), Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; As indicated by the title of his study, however, Rossi claims Bacon ultimately rejected the philosophical foundations of occultism as he came to develop a form of modern science.&lt;ref name="Rossi 1968, Chapter 1"/&gt;

Rossi's analysis and claims have been extended by Jason Josephson-Storm in his study, ''The Myth of Disenchantment''. Josephson-Storm also rejects conspiracy theories surrounding Bacon and does not make the claim that Bacon was an active Rosicrucian. However, he argues that Bacon's "rejection" of magic actually constituted an attempt to purify magic of Catholic, demonic, and esoteric influences and to establish magic as a field of study and application paralleling Bacon's vision of science. Furthermore, Josephson-Storm argues that Bacon drew on magical ideas when developing his experimental method.&lt;ref&gt;Josephson-Storm (2017), p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; Josephson-Storm finds evidence that Bacon considered nature a living entity, populated by spirits, and argues Bacon's views on the human domination and application of nature actually depend on his spiritualism and personification of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Josephson-Storm (2017), pp. 50–51&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rosicrucian organisation [[Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis|AMORC]] claims that Bacon was the "Imperator" (leader) of the Rosicrucian Order in both England and the European continent, and would have directed it during his lifetime.&lt;ref name="HistoryofLife"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Mastery of Life |url=http://www.rosicrucian.org/about/mastery/mastery.pdf |format=PDF |page=31 |publisher=Rosicrucian.org |accessdate=21 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bacon's influence can also be seen on a variety of religious and spiritual authors, and on groups that have utilised his writings in their own belief systems.&lt;ref&gt;Saint Germain Foundation. ''The History of the "I AM" Activity and Saint Germain Foundation''. Schaumburg, Illinois: Saint Germain Press 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luk, A.D.K.. ''Law of Life – Book II''. Pueblo, Colorado: A.D.K. Luk Publications 1989, pp. 254–267&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''White Paper – Wesak World Congress 2002''. Acropolis Sophia Books &amp; Works 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Partridge, Christopher ed. ''New Religions: A Guide: New Religious Movements, Sects and Alternative Spiritualities'' Oxford University Press, United States 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder, Werner ''Ascended Masters and Their Retreats'' Ascended Master Teaching Foundation 2004, pp. 250–255&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Igualtat de sexes.svg|thumb|upright|A generic symbol for gender equality]]
'''Gender equality''', also known as '''sexual equality''', is the state of equal ease of access to resources and opportunities regardless of gender, including economic participation and decision-making; and the state of valuing different behaviors, aspirations and needs equally, regardless of gender.

{{Quote|text=Gender equality, equality between men and women, entails the concept that all human beings, both men and women, are free to develop their personal abilities and make choices without the limitations set by stereotypes, rigid gender roles and prejudices. Gender equality means that the different behaviour, aspirations and needs of women and men are considered, valued and favoured equally. It does not mean that women and men have to become the same, but that their rights, responsibilities and opportunities will not depend on whether they are born male or female. Gender equity means fairness of treatment for women and men, according to their respective needs. This may include equal treatment or treatment that is different but which is considered equivalent in terms of rights, benefits, obligations and opportunities.|sign=ABC Of Women Worker's Rights And Gender Equality|source=ILO, 2000. p. 48.}}

Gender equality is the goal, while gender neutrality and gender equity are practices and ways of thinking that help in achieving the goal. Gender parity, which is used to measure gender balance in a given situation, can aid in achieving gender equality but is not the goal in and of itself. Gender equality is more than equal representation, it is strongly tied to [[women's rights]], and often requires policy changes. As of 2017, the global movement for gender equality has not incorporated the proposition of [[Third gender|genders besides women and men]], or [[Gender identity|gender identities]] outside of the [[gender binary]].

[[UNICEF]] says gender equality "means that women and men, and girls and boys, enjoy the same rights, resources, opportunities and protections. It does not require that girls and boys, or women and men, be the same, or that they be treated exactly alike."&lt;ref name="UNICEF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/gender/files/Overarching_2Pager_Web.pdf|title=Promoting Gender Equality: An Equity-based Approach to Programming|first=Roger|date=2011|website=Operational Guidance Overview in Brief|publisher=UNICEF|accessdate=2011-01-28|author=LeMoyne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a global scale, achieving gender equality also requires eliminating harmful practices against women and girls, including [[sex trafficking]], [[femicide]], [[wartime sexual violence]], and other [[Violence against women|oppression tactics]]. [[UNFPA]] stated that, "despite many international agreements affirming their human rights, women are still much more likely than men to be poor and illiterate. They have less access to property ownership, credit, training and employment. They are far less likely than men to be politically active and far more likely to be victims of domestic violence."&lt;ref name="unfpa.org1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/gender-equality|title=Gender equality|last=|first=|date=|website=United Nations Population Fund|publisher=UNFPA|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2017, gender equality is the fifth of seventeen [[Sustainable Development Goals|sustainable development goals]] of the [[United Nations]]. [[Gender inequality]] is measured annually by the [[United Nations Development Programme]]'s [[Human Development Report]]s.

== History ==
[[Christine de Pizan]], an early advocate for gender equality, states in her 1405 book ''[[The Book of the City of Ladies]]'' that the oppression of women is founded on irrational prejudice, pointing out numerous advances in society probably created by women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Real Wealth of Nations: Creating a Caring Economics|author=Riane Eisler|authorlink=Riane Eisler|year=2007|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Shakers]], an evangelical group, which practiced segregation of the sexes and strict [[celibacy]], were early practitioners of gender equality. They branched off from a [[Quaker]] community in the north-west of England before emigrating to America in 1774. In America, the head of the Shakers' central ministry in 1788, Joseph Meacham, had a revelation that the sexes should be equal. He then brought [[Lucy Wright]] into the ministry as his female counterpart, and together they restructured the society to balance the rights of the sexes. Meacham and Wright established leadership teams where each elder, who dealt with the men's spiritual welfare, was partnered with an eldress, who did the same for women. Each deacon was partnered with a deaconess. Men had oversight of men; women had oversight of women. Women lived with women; men lived with men. In Shaker society, a woman did not have to be controlled or owned by any man. After Meacham's death in 1796, Wright became the head of the Shaker ministry until her death in 1821.

Shakers maintained the same pattern of gender-balanced leadership for more than 200 years. They also promoted equality by working together with other women's rights advocates. In 1859, Shaker Elder Frederick Evans stated their beliefs forcefully, writing that Shakers were "the first to disenthrall woman from the condition of vassalage to which all other religious systems (more or less) consign her, and to secure to her those just and equal rights with man that, by her similarity to him in organization and faculties, both God and nature would seem to demand".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Frederick William |last=Evans |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fg2bS2pDUVMC&amp;pg=PA34 |title=Shakers: Compendium of the Origin, History, Principles, Rules and Regulations, Government, and Doctrines of the United Society of Believers in Christ's Second Appearing |place=New York |publisher=D. Appleton &amp; Co. |year=1859 |page=34 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evans and his counterpart, Eldress Antoinette Doolittle, joined women's rights advocates on speakers' platforms throughout the northeastern U.S. in the 1870s. A visitor to the Shakers wrote in 1875:
{{Quote|Each sex works in its own appropriate sphere of action, there being a proper subordination, deference and respect of the female to the male in his order, {{em|and of the male to the female in her order}} [emphasis added], so that in any of these communities the zealous advocates of "women’s rights" may here find a practical realization of their ideal.&lt;ref&gt;Glendyne R. Wergland, ''Sisters in the Faith: Shaker Women and Equality of the Sexes'' (Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Shakers were more than a radical religious sect on the fringes of American society; they put equality of the sexes into practice. It has been argued that they demonstrated that gender equality was achievable and how to achieve it.&lt;ref&gt;Wendy R. Benningfield, Appeal of the Sisterhood: The Shakers and the Woman's Rights Movement (University of Kentucky Lexington doctoral dissertation, 2004), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

In wider society, the movement towards gender equality began with the [[suffragette|suffrage movement]] in Western cultures in the late-19th century, which sought to allow women to vote and hold elected office. This period also witnessed significant changes to [[women's property rights]], particularly in relation to their marital status. (See for example, [[Married Women's Property Act 1882]].)

===Post-war era===
{{Further|Anti-discrimination laws}}
{{Further|Timeline of women's legal rights (other than voting)}}
Since [[World War II]], the [[women's liberation]] movement and [[feminism]] have created a general movement towards recognition of [[women's rights]]. The [[United Nations]] and other international agencies have adopted several conventions which promote gender equality. These conventions have not been uniformly adopted by all countries, and include:
* The [[Convention against Discrimination in Education]] was adopted in 1960, and came into force in 1962 and 1968.
* The [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] (CEDAW) was adopted in 1979 by the [[United Nations General Assembly]]. It has been described as an international [[bill of rights]] for women, which came into force on 3 September 1981.
* The [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]], a [[human rights]] declaration adopted by consensus at the [[World Conference on Human Rights]] on 25 June 1993 in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. Women's rights are addressed at para 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees | author-link = United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees | title = Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action | url = http://www.refworld.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/rwmain?page=topic&amp;tocid=459d17822&amp;toid=459b17a82&amp;docid=3ae6b39ec&amp;skip=O | publisher = [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] | accessdate = 14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in 1993.
* In 1994, the twenty-year ''Cairo Programme of Action'' was adopted at the [[International Conference on Population and Development]] (ICPD) in [[Cairo]]. This [[Non-binding resolution|non binding]] programme-of-action asserted that governments have a responsibility to meet individuals' reproductive needs, rather than demographic targets. As such, it called for [[family planning]], [[reproductive rights]] services, and strategies to promote gender equality and stop violence against women.
* Also in 1994, in the Americas, the [http://www.oas.org/juridico/english/treaties/a-61.html Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment, and Eradication of Violence against Women], known as the ''Convention of Belém do Pará'', called for the end of violence and discrimination against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Organization of American States | author-link = Organization of American States | title = Follow-up Mechanism to the Belém do Pará Convention (MESECVI): About the Belém do Pará Convention | publisher = [[Organization of American States]] | url = http://www.oas.org/en/mesecvi/convention.asp | accessdate = 14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* At the end of the [[Fourth World Conference on Women]], the UN adopted the [[Beijing Declaration]] on 15 September 1995 - a [[United Nations General Assembly resolution|resolution]] adopted to promulgate a set of principles concerning gender equality.
* The [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325]] (UNSRC 1325), which was adopted on 31 October 2000, deals with the rights and protection of women and girls during and after [[armed conflict]]s.
* The [[Maputo Protocol]] guarantees comprehensive rights to women, including the right to take part in the political process, to social and political equality with men, to control their [[reproductive health]], and an end to [[female genital cutting|female genital mutilation]]. It was adopted by the [[African Union]] in the form of a protocol to the [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]] and came into force in 2005.
* The EU [[Directive (European Union)|directive]] ''Directive 2002/73/EC - equal treatment of 23 September 2002 amending Council Directive 76/207/EEC on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working conditions'' states that: "Harassment and sexual harassment within the meaning of this Directive shall be deemed to be discrimination on the grounds of sex and therefore prohibited."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:1976L0207:20021005:EN:PDF|title=Directive 2002/73/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of European Communities|last=|first=|date=9 February 1976|publisher=EUR-Lex Access to European Union law|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Council of Europe]]'s [[Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence]], the first legally binding instrument in Europe in the field of violence against women,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Convention of Belém do Pará and the Istanbul Convention: a response to violence against women worldwide | url = https://www.oas.org/es/mesecvi/docs/CSW-SideEvent2014-Flyer-EN.pdf | format = PDF | publisher = [[Organization of American States]], [[Council of Europe]], [[Permanent Mission of France to the United Nations]] and Permanent Mission of Argentina to the United Nations | date = March 2014 }} CSW58 side event flyer 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; came into force in 2014.
* The [[Council of Europe]]'s ''Gender Equality Strategy 2014-2017'', which has five strategic objectives:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=2105977&amp;Site=COE&amp;BackColorInternet=C3C3C3&amp;BackColorIntranet=EDB021&amp;BackColorLogged=F5D383|title=Committee of Ministers - Gender Equality Commission (GEC) - Gender Equality Strategy 2014-2017 [1183 meeting]|author=Council of Europe, Committee of Ministers, CM document (CM)|website=Wcd.coe.int|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:*Combating [[gender stereotypes]] and sexism
:*Preventing and combating [[violence against women]]
:*Guaranteeing Equal Access of Women to Justice
:*Achieving balanced participation of women and men in political and public decision-making
:*Achieving [[Gender mainstreaming|Gender Mainstreaming]] in all policies and measures

Such [[legislation]] and [[affirmative action]] policies have been critical to bringing changes in societal attitudes. A 2015 Pew Research Center survey of citizens in 38 countries found that majorities in 37 of those 38 countries said that gender equality is at least "somewhat important," and a global median of 65% believe it is "very important" that women have the same rights as men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/03/08/strong-global-support-for-gender-equality-especially-among-women/|title=Strong global support for gender equality, especially among women|last=Zainulbhai|first=Hani|date=2016-03-08|website=Pew Research|access-date=2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most occupations are now equally available to men and women, in many countries.{{Refn|For example, many countries now permit women to serve in the [[armed forces]], the [[police|police forces]] and to be [[fire fighter]]s – occupations traditionally reserved for men. Although these continue to have a male majority, an increasing number of women are now active, especially in directive fields such as politics, and occupy high positions in business.|group=lower-roman}}

Similarly, men are increasingly working in occupations which in previous generations had been considered [[women's work]], such as [[nursing]], [[Maid|cleaning]] and [[child care]]. In domestic situations, the role of [[Parenting]] or child rearing is more commonly shared or not as widely considered to be an exclusively female role, so that women may be free to pursue a [[career]] after [[childbirth]]. For further information, see [[Shared earning/shared parenting marriage]].

Another manifestation of the change in social attitudes is the [[Married and maiden names#Feminism and preserving one's personal name|non-automatic taking by a woman of her husband's surname on marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29804450|title=Why should women change their names on getting married?|last=Coulombeau|first=Sophie|date=1 November 2014|publisher=BBC|website=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A highly contentious issue relating to gender equality is the role of women in [[religious law|religiously orientated societies]].{{Refn|For example, [[Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam#Contents|the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam]] declared that women have equal dignity but not equal rights, and this was accepted by many predominantly Muslim countries.|group=lower-roman}}{{Refn|In some [[Christianity|Christian churches]], the practice of [[churching of women]] may still have elements of [[ritual purification]] and the [[Ordination of women]] to the priesthood may be restricted or forbidden.|group=lower-roman}} Some Christians or Muslims believe in [[Complementarianism]], a view that holds that men and women have different but complementing roles. This view may be in opposition to the views and goals of gender equality.

In addition, there are also non-Western countries of low religiosity where the contention surrounding gender equality remains. In China, a [[Sex-selective abortion and female infanticide#Cultural preference|cultural preference for a male child]] has resulted in a [[Missing women of Asia|shortfall of women]] in the population. [[Feminism in Japan|The feminist movement in Japan]] has made many strides which resulted in Rethe [[Gender Equality Bureau]], but Japan still remains low in gender equality compared to other industrialized nations.

The notion of gender equality, and of its degree of achievement in a certain country, is very complex because there are countries that have a history of a high level of gender equality in certain areas of life but not in other areas.{{Refn|An example is [[Finland]], which has offered very high opportunities to women in public/professional life but has had a weak legal approach to the issue of [[violence against women]], with the situation in this country having been called a [[paradox]].&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Clarke | first = Kris | title = The paradoxical approach to intimate partner violence in Finland | journal = [[Tokiwa University#Publications|International Perspectives in Victimology]] | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 9–19 | doi = 10.5364/ipiv.6.1.19 | date = August 2011 | url = http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/83438809/paradoxical-approach-intimate-partner-violence-finland | ref = harv | postscript = .| doi-broken-date = 2018-08-27 }} [https://www.academia.edu/992154/The_Paradoxical_Approach_to_Intimate_Partner_Violence_in_Finland Available through academia.edu.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=McKie |first1=Linda |last2=Hearn |first2=Jeff |title=Gender-neutrality and gender equality: comparing and contrasting policy responses to 'domestic violence' in Finland and Scotland |journal=[[Scottish Affairs]] |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=85–107 |doi=10.3366/scot.2004.0043 |date=August 2004 |ref=harv |postscript=. }} [https://web.archive.org/web/20131021023708/http://www.scottishaffairs.org/backiss/pdfs/sa48/sa48_McKie_and_Hearn.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;"Finland is repeatedly reminded of its widespread problem of violence against women and recommended to take more efficient measures to deal with the situation. International criticism concentrates on the lack of measures to combat violence against women in general and in particular on the lack of a national action plan to combat such violence and on the lack of legislation on domestic violence. (...) Compared to Sweden, Finland has been slower to reform legislation on violence against women. In Sweden, domestic violence was already illegal in 1864, while in Finland such violence was not outlawed until 1970, over a hundred years later. In Sweden the punishment of victims of incest was abolished in 1937 but not until 1971 in Finland. Rape within marriage was criminalised in Sweden in 1962, but the equivalent Finnish legislation only came into force in 1994 — making Finland one of the last European countries to criminalise marital rape. In addition, assaults taking place on private property did not become impeachable offences in Finland until 1995. Only in 1997 did victims of sexual offences and domestic violence in Finland become entitled to government-funded counselling and support services for the duration of their court cases."&lt;ref name=Amnesty_Finland group=upper-roman&gt;{{citation | last = Danish, Swedish, Finnish and Norwegian sections of Amnesty International | contribution = Rape and human rights in Finland | editor-last = Danish, Swedish, Finnish and Norwegian sections of Amnesty International | title = Case closed: rape and human rights in the Nordic countries | url = http://humanrightshouse.org/Articles/13618.html | pages = 89–91 | publisher = [[Amnesty International]] | date = March 2010 | quote =| ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://amnesty.dk/media/1557/case-closed.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}}{{Refn|[[Denmark]] received harsh criticism for inadequate laws in regard to [[sexual violence]] in a 2008 report produced by [[Amnesty International]],&lt;ref name=Amnesty_Finland group=upper-roman /&gt; which described Danish laws as "inconsistent with international human rights standards".&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite book | last = Amnesty International | author-link = Amnesty International | title = Denmark: human rights violations and concerns in the context of counter-terrorism, immigration-detention, forcible return of rejected asylum-seekers and violence against women | url = http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/docs/ngos/AI_Denmark_November2010.pdf | format = PDF | publisher = [[Amnesty International]] | date = May 2011 }} Amnesty International submission to the UN Universal Periodic Review, May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to Denmark reforming its sexual offenses legislation in 2013.&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnesty.dk/nyhed/amnesty/ny-voldtaegtslovgivning-er-en-sejr-danske-kvinders-retssikkerhed|title=Ny voldtægtslovgivning er en sejr for danske kvinders retssikkerhed|website=Amnesty.dk - Amnesty International|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b.dk/nationalt/slut-med-konerabat-for-voldtaegt|title=Slut med "konerabat" for voldtægt|date=3 June 2013|website=www.b.dk|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=164192|title=Straffeloven - Bekendtgørelse af straffeloven |website=Retsinformation.dk|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}} Indeed, there is a need for caution when categorizing countries by the level of gender equality that they have achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Working with men in health and social care|last2=Rivett|first2=Mark|last3=Scourfield|first3=Jonathan|year=2007|isbn=9781412918503|location=|page=|pages=27|last1=Featherstone|first1=Brid}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mala Htun and Laurel Weldon "gender policy is not one issue but many" and:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Htun | first1 = Mala | last2 = Weldon | first2 = S.

Not all beliefs relating to gender equality have been popularly adopted. For example, [[topfreedom]], the right to be bare breasted in public, frequently applies only to males and has remained a marginal issue.

There has been criticism from some feminists towards the political discourse and policies employed in order to achieve the above items of "progress" in gender equality, with critics arguing that these gender equality strategies are superficial, in that they do not seek to challenge social structures of male domination, and only aim at improving the situation of women within the societal framework of subordination of women to men,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/966913723|title=Man's dominion : religion and the eclipse of women's rights in world politics|last=Sheila|first=Jeffreys,|date=2012-01-01|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9780415596732|location=|pages=94|oclc=966913723}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that official public policies (such as state policies or international bodies policies) are questionable, as they are applied in a patriarchal context, and are directly or indirectly controlled by agents of a system which is for the most part male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=EU Gender Policy: Trapped in the 'Wollstonecraft Dilemma'?|first=Emanuela|last=Lombardo|date=1 May 2003|journal=European Journal of Women's Studies|volume=10|issue=2|pages=159–180|doi=10.1177/1350506803010002003}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the criticisms of the gender equality policies, in particular, those of the [[European Union]], is that they disproportionately focus on policies integrating women in public life, but do not seek to genuinely address the deep private sphere oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/647686058|title=Multiple meanings of gender equality : a critical frame analysis of gender policies in Europe|last=Lombardo|first=Emanuela|last2=Jalušiè|first2=Vlasta|last3=Maloutas|first3=Maro Pantelidou|last4=Sauer|first4=Birgit|date=|publisher=Central European University Press Budapest|year=2007|isbn=9786155211393|editor-last=Verloo|editor-first=Mike|location=New York|pages=79–108|chapter=III.

A further criticism is that a focus on the situation of women in non-Western countries, while often ignoring the issues that exist in the West, is a form of [[imperialism]] and of reinforcing Western moral superiority; and a way of "othering" of domestic violence, by presenting it as something specific to outsiders - the "violent others" - and not to the allegedly progressive Western cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://academic.oup.com/sp/article-abstract/20/4/534/1714604/The-Othering-of-Domestic-Violence-The-EU-and|title=The Othering of Domestic Violence: The EU and Cultural Framings of Violence against Women|first1=Celeste|last1=Montoya|first2=Lise|last2=Rolandsen Agustín|date=1 December 2013|journal=Soc Polit|volume=20|issue=4|pages=534–557|via=sp.oxfordjournals.org|doi=10.1093/sp/jxt020}}&lt;/ref&gt; These critics point out that women in Western countries often face similar problems, such as domestic violence and rape, as in other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/316143234|title=An introduction to feminist philosophy|last=Alison|first=Stone|date=|publisher=Polity Press|year=2008|isbn=9780745638836|location=|pages=209–211|oclc=316143234}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also cite the fact that women faced de jure legal discrimination until just a few decades ago; for instance, in some Western countries such as Switzerland, Greece, Spain, and France, women obtained equal rights in [[family law]] in the 1980s.{{Refn|In Switzerland in 1985, a referendum guaranteed women legal equality with men within marriage.&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17988450|title=Switzerland profile - Timeline|date=28 December 2016|website=Bbc.com|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch/chronology-womens-right-vote-switzerland.html|title=The Long Way to Women's Right to Vote in Switzerland: a Chronology|first=Markus G.

==Efforts to fight inequality==
{{see also|Gender inequality}}
In 2010, the [[European Union]] opened the [[European Institute for Gender Equality]] (EIGE) in [[Vilnius]], [[Lithuania]] to promote gender equality and to fight [[sex discrimination]]. In 2015 the EU published the Gender Action Plan 2016–2020.&lt;ref name="GAP2016"&gt;{{cite web|title=The European Union's new Gender Action Plan 2016–2020: gender equality and women's empowerment in external relations|url=https://www.odi.org/publications/10021-gender-equality-empowerment-eu-external-relations-gap-2016_2020|website=odi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender equality is part of the national curriculum in Great Britain and many other European countries. By presidential decree, the Republic of Kazakhstan created a Strategy for Gender Equality 2006–2016 to chart the subsequent decade of gender equality efforts.&lt;ref name="sgeinkz"&gt;{{cite web|title=Strategy for Gender Equality in Kazakhstan 2006–2016|url=https://www.ndi.org/files/Kazakhstan-Gender-Strategy-2006-2016.pdf|website=NDI.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Personal, Social and Health Education]], [[Religious education|religious studies]] and [[Language acquisition]] curricula tend to address gender equality issues as a very serious topic for discussion and analysis of its effect in society.

A large and growing body of research has shown how gender inequality undermines health and development. To overcome gender inequality the [[United Nations Population Fund]] states that, "Women's empowerment and gender equality requires strategic interventions at all levels of programming and policy-making. These levels include reproductive health, economic empowerment, educational empowerment and political empowerment."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/resources/engaging-men-and-boys-brief-summary-unfpa-experience-and-lessons-learned|title=Engaging Men and Boys: A Brief Summary of UNFPA Experience and Lessons Learned|last=|first=|date=2013|website=UNFPA: United Nations Population Fund|language=en|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[UNFPA]] says that "research has also demonstrated how working with men and boys as well as women and girls to promote gender equality contributes to achieving health and development outcomes."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

{{Further|Gender disparities in health}}
Social constructs of [[gender]] (that is, cultural ideals of socially acceptable [[masculinity]] and [[femininity]]) often have a negative effect on health. The World Health Organization cites the example of women not being allowed to travel alone outside the home (to go to the hospital), and women being prevented by cultural norms to ask their husbands to use a condom, in cultures which simultaneously encourage male promiscuity, as social norms that harm [[women's health]]. Teenage boys suffering accidents due to social expectations of impressing their peers through [[risk|risk taking]], and men dying at much higher rate from [[lung cancer]] due to [[smoking]], in cultures which link smoking to masculinity, are cited by the WHO as examples of gender norms negatively affecting [[men's health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/gender/genderandhealth/en/|title=WHO: World Health Organization|website=Who.int|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Health Organization has also stated that there is a strong connection between gender socialization and transmission and lack of adequate management of [[HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

====Violence against women====
[[File:FGM road sign, Bakau, Gambia, 2005.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Anti-[[FGM]] road sign, Bakau, Gambia, 2005]]
{{Main article|Violence against women}}
[[Violence against women]] is a technical term used to collectively refer to violent acts that are primarily or exclusively committed against women.{{Refn|Forms of violence against women include [[Sexual violence]] (including [[War Rape]], [[Marital rape]], [[Date rape]] by drugs or alcohol, and [[Child sexual abuse]], the latter often in the context of [[Child marriage]]), [[Domestic violence]], [[Forced marriage]], [[Female genital mutilation]], [[Forced prostitution]], [[Sex trafficking]], [[Honor killing]], [[Dowry killing]], [[Acid attacks]], [[Stoning]], [[Flogging]], [[Forced sterilisation]], [[Forced abortion]], violence related to accusations of witchcraft, mistreatment of widows (e.g. widow inheritance). Fighting against violence against women is considered a key issue for achieving gender equality. The Council of Europe adopted the Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (Istanbul Convention).|group=lower-roman}} This type of violence is gender-based, meaning that the acts of violence are committed against women expressly ''because'' they are women, or as a result of patriarchal gender constructs.{{Refn|The UN [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] defines violence against women as "any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life" and states that:"violence against women is a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women, which have led to domination over and discrimination against women by men and to the prevention of the full advancement of women, and that violence against women is one of the crucial social mechanisms by which women are forced into a subordinate position compared with men."&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un-documents.net/a48r104.htm|title=Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women|author=|publisher=United Nations General Assembly|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}} Violence and mistreatment of women in marriage has come to international attention during the past decades. This includes both violence committed inside marriage ([[domestic violence]]) as well as violence related to marriage customs and traditions (such as [[dowry]], [[bride price]], [[forced marriage]] and [[child marriage]]).

According to some theories, violence against women is often caused by the acceptance of violence by various cultural groups as a means of conflict resolution within intimate relationships. Studies on [[Intimate partner violence]] victimization among ethnic minorities in the United Studies have consistently revealed that immigrants are a high-risk group for intimate violence.&lt;ref&gt;Bachman, Ronet (January 1994).&amp;nbsp;[https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/digitization/145325ncjrs.pdf Violence Against Women: A National Crime Victimization Survey Report]&amp;nbsp;(PDF)(Report).

In some parts of the world, various forms of violence against women are tolerated and accepted as parts of everyday life.{{Refn|According to UNFPA:&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/gender/practices.htm|title=Gender equality|publisher=United Nations Population Fund|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence|Istanbul Convention]] acknowledges the long tradition of European countries of ignoring this form of violence.{{Refn|In its [http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Reports/Html/210.htm explanatory report] at para 219, it states:

In some cultures, acts of violence against women are seen as crimes against the male 'owners' of the woman, such as husband, father or male relatives, rather the woman herself. This leads to practices where men inflict violence upon women in order to get revenge on male members of the women's family.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unwomen.org/~/media/headquarters/attachments/sections/library/publications/2012/12/unw-legislation-supplement-en%20pdf.pdf|title=Supplement to the Handbook for Legislation on Violence Against Women: Harmful Practices Against Women|last=|first=|date=2012|website=UN Women|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such practices include [[Types of rape#Payback rape|payback rape]], a form of rape specific to certain cultures, particularly the [[Pacific Islands]], which consists of the rape of a female, usually by a group of several males, as revenge for acts committed by members of her family, such as her father or brothers, with the rape being meant to humiliate the father or brothers, as punishment for their prior behavior towards the perpetrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://waaiabulletin.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/png_activist_toolkit_16_days_2009_-_iwd_2010.pdf|title=Many Voices One Message: Stop Violence Against Women in PNG|last=|first=|date=2009–2010|website=Activist Toolkit, Amnesty International|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard A.

Posner, page 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, rape was seen in many cultures (and is still seen today in some societies) as a crime against the [[Family honor|honor of the family]], rather than against the self-determination of the woman. As a result, victims of rape may face violence, in extreme cases even honor killings, at the hands of their family members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/honourcrimes/crimesofhonour_1.shtml|title=Ethics: Honour crimes |website=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13760895|title=Libya rape victims 'face honour killings'|website=BBC News|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Catharine MacKinnon]] argues that in male dominated societies, sexual intercourse is imposed on women in a coercive and unequal way, creating a continuum of victimization, where women have few positive sexual experiences.{{Refn|She writes "To know what is wrong with rape, know what is right about sex. If this, in turn, is difficult, the difficulty is as instructive as the difficulty men have in telling the difference when women see one. Perhaps the wrong of rape has proved so difficult to define because the unquestionable starting point has been that rape is defined as distinct from intercourse, while for women it is difficult to distinguish the two under conditions of male dominance."&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;''Toward a Feminist Theory of the State'', by Catharine A. MacKinnon, pp 174&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}} Socialization within rigid gender constructs often creates an environment where sexual violence is common.{{Refn|According to the World Health Organization: "Sexual violence is also more likely to occur where beliefs in male sexual entitlement are strong, where gender roles are more rigid, and in countries experiencing high rates of other types of violence."&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/en/summary_en.pdf|title=World report on violence and health: summary|website=World Health Organization|date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}} One of the challenges of dealing with sexual violence is that in many societies women are perceived as being readily available for sex, and men are seen as entitled to their bodies, until and unless women object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/32000/ior530012011en.pdf|title=Rape and Sexual Violence: Human rights law and standards in the international criminal court|last=|first=|date=1 March 2011|website=Amnesty International|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/64000/eur270022007en.pdf|title=Hungary: Cries Unheard: The Failure To Protect Women From Rape And Sexual Violence In The Home|publisher=Amnesty International|date=2007|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Refn|Rebecca Cook wrote in ''Submission of Interights to the European Court of Human Rights in the case of [[M.C. v.

The importance of women having the right and possibility to have control over their body, reproduction decisions, and sexuality, and the need for gender equality in order to achieve these goals are recognized as crucial by the [[Fourth World Conference on Women]] in Beijing and the UN [[International Conference on Population and Development]] Program of Action. The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that promotion of gender equality is crucial in the fight against [[HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/gender/hiv_aids/en/|title=WHO: World Health Organization|website=Who.int|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maternal mortality]] is a major problem in many parts of the world. [[UNFPA]] states that countries have an obligation to protect women's right to health, but many countries do not do that.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/reducing_mm.pdf|title=Reducing Maternal Mortality: The contribution of the right to the highest attainable standard of health|last=Hunt|first=Paul|last2=Mezquita de Bueno|first2=Julia|publisher=University of Essex|year=2010|isbn=|location=United Nations Population Fund|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maternal mortality is considered today not just an issue of development but also an issue of [[human rights]].{{Refn|[[UNFPA]] says that, "since 1990, the world has seen a 45 per cent decline in maternal mortality – an enormous achievement. But in spite of these gains, almost 800 women still die every day from causes related to pregnancy or childbirth. This is about one woman every two minutes."&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/maternal-health|title=Maternal health: UNFPA – United Nations Population Fund|website=Unfpa.org|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to UNFPA:&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

:"Preventable maternal mortality occurs where there is a failure to give effect to the rights of women to health, equality, and non-discrimination. Preventable maternal mortality also often represents a violation of a woman’s right to life."|group=lower-roman}}

The right to reproductive and sexual autonomy is denied to women in many parts of the world, through practices such as [[forced sterilization]], forced/coerced sexual partnering (e.g. [[forced marriage]], [[child marriage]]), criminalization of consensual sexual acts (such as [[sex outside marriage]]), lack of criminalization of [[marital rape]], violence in regard to the choice of partner ([[honor killings]] as punishment for 'inappropriate' relations).{{Refn|Amnesty International’s Secretary General has stated that: "It is unbelievable that in the twenty-first century some countries are condoning child marriage and marital rape while others are outlawing abortion, sex outside marriage and same-sex sexual activity – even punishable by death."&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/sexual-and-reproductive-rights-under-threat-worldwide-2014-03-06|title=Sexual and reproductive rights under threat worldwide|publisher=Amnesty International|date=March 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}} The sexual health of women is often poor in societies where a woman's right to control her sexuality is not recognized.{{Refn|High Commissioner for Human Rights [[Navi Pillay]] has called for full respect and recognition of women's autonomy and sexual and reproductive health rights, stating:

:"Violations of women's human rights are often linked to their sexuality and reproductive role. Women are frequently treated as property, they are sold into marriage, into trafficking, into sexual slavery. Violence against women frequently takes the form of sexual violence. Victims of such violence are often accused of promiscuity and held responsible for their fate, while infertile women are rejected by husbands, families, and communities. In many countries, married women may not refuse to have sexual relations with their husbands, and often have no say in whether they use contraception."&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chr.up.ac.za/images/files/news/news_2012/Navi%20Pillay%20Lecture%2015%20May%202012.pdf|title=Valuing Women as Autonomous Beings: Women's sexual and reproductive rights|last=Pillay|first=Navi|date=May 15, 2012|website=University of Pretoria, Centre for Human Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These practices infringe on the right of achieving reproductive and sexual health.|group=lower-roman}}

[[Adolescent]] girls have the highest risk of sexual coercion, sexual ill health, and negative reproductive outcomes. The risks they face are higher than those of boys and men; this increased risk is partly due to gender inequity (different socialization of boys and girls, gender based violence, child marriage) and partly due to biological factors.{{Refn|Females' risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections during unprotected sexual relations is two to four times that of males'.&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/resources/giving-special-attention-girls-and-adolescents|title=Giving Special Attention to Girls and Adolescents|website=Unfpa.org|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}}

=====Family planning and abortion=====
[[File:Familiy Planning Ethiopia (bad effects).jpg|thumb|Placard showing negative effects of lack of family planning and having too many [[child]]ren and [[infant]]s ([[Ethiopia]])]]

[[Family planning]] is the practice of freely deciding the number of children one has and the intervals between their births, particularly by means of contraception or voluntary sterilization. Abortion is the induced termination of pregnancy. [[Abortion law]]s vary significantly by country. The availability of contraception, sterilization and abortion is dependent on laws, as well as social, cultural and religious norms. Some countries have liberal laws regarding these issues, but in practice it is very difficult to access such services due to doctors, pharmacists and other social and medical workers being [[conscientious objector]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/11/italian-gynaecologists-refuse-abortions-miscarriages|title=Seven in 10 Italian gynaecologists refuse to carry out abortions|first1=Stephanie Kirchgaessner Pamela|last1=Duncan|first2=Alberto|last2=Nardelli|first3=Delphine|last3=Robineau|date=11 March 2016|website=Theguardian.com|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/doctors-refusal-to-perform-abortions-divides-croatia-02-13-2017|title=Doctors' Refusal to Perform Abortions Divides Croatia |website=Balkan Insight |accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Family planning is particularly important from a women's rights perspective, as having very many pregnancies, especially in areas where malnutrition is present, can seriously endanger women's health. UNFA writes that "Family planning is central to gender equality and women’s empowerment, and it is a key factor in reducing poverty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/family-planning|title=Family planning: UNFPA – United Nations Population Fund|website=Unfpa.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Family planning is often opposed by governments who have strong [[natalist]] policies. During the 20th century, such examples have included the aggressive natalist policies from [[communist Romania]] and [[communist Albania]]. State mandated [[forced marriage]] was also practiced by some authoritarian governments as a way to meet population targets: the [[Khmer Rouge]] regime in [[Cambodia]] systematically forced people into marriages, in order to increase the population and continue the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.d.dccam.org/Abouts/Intern/Natalae_Forced_marriage.pdf |format=PDF|author=Natalae Anderson|title=Documentation Center of Cambodia, ''Memorandum: Charging Forced Marriage as a Crime Against Humanity,''|date=September 22, 2010|website=D.dccam.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the [[one child policy]] of China (1979–2015) included punishments for families with more than one child and [[forced abortion]]s. Some governments have sought to prevent certain ethnic or social groups from reproduction. Such policies were carried out against ethnic minorities in Europe and North America in the 20th century, and more recently in Latin America against the Indigenous population in the 1990s; in [[Peru]], President [[Alberto Fujimori]] (in office from 1990 to 2000) has been accused of [[genocide]] and [[crimes against humanity]] as a result of a sterilization program put in place by his administration targeting indigenous people (mainly the [[Quechua people|Quechuas]] and the [[Aymara people|Aymaras]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/2148793.stm|title=Mass sterilisation scandal shocks Peru|date=24 July 2002|website=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Investigation and prosecution of crimes against women and girls====
Human rights organizations have expressed concern about the legal [[impunity]] of perpetrators of crimes against women, with such crimes being often ignored by authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/ImpunityForVAWGlobalConcern.aspx|title=Impunity for violence against women is a global concern|website=Ohchr.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially the case with murders of women in [[Latin America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cedaw/docs/ngos/CDDandCMDPDH_forthesession_Mexico_CEDAW52.pdf|format=PDF|title=Femicide and Impunity in Mexico: A context of structural and genearlized violence|website=2.ohchr.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2013/4/femicide-in-latin-america|title=Femicide in Latin America|website=Unwomen.org|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cgrs.uchastings.edu/our-work/central-america-femicides-and-gender-based-violence|title=Central America: Femicides and Gender-Based Violence|website=Cgrs.uchastings.edu|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, there is impunity in regard to [[domestic violence]].{{Refn|High Commissioner for Human Rights, [[Navi Pillay]], has stated on domestic violence against women: "The reality for most victims, including victims of honor killings, is that state institutions fail them and that most perpetrators of domestic violence can rely on a culture of impunity for the acts they commit – acts which would often be considered as crimes, and be punished as such, if they were committed against strangers."&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=9869&amp;LangID=E|title=High Commissioner speaks out against domestic violence and "honour killing" on occasion of International Women's Day"|website=Ohchr.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}}

Women are often, in law or in practice, unable to access legal institutions. UN Women has said that: "Too often, justice institutions, including the police and the courts, deny women justice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://progress.unwomen.org/|title=Progress of the World's Women 2015–2016|website=My Favorite News|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, women are denied legal recourse because the state institutions themselves are structured and operate in ways incompatible with genuine justice for women who experience violence.{{Refn|According to Amnesty International, "Women who are victims of gender-related violence often have little recourse because many state agencies are themselves guilty of gender bias and discriminatory practices."&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/issues/women-s-rights/violence-against-women/violence-against-women-information|title=Violence Against Women Information|website=Amnesty International USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}}

====Harmful traditional practices====
[[File:Say no to dowry.jpg|thumb|Anti-dowry poster in [[Bangalore, India]]]]

"Harmful traditional practices" refer to forms of violence which are committed in certain communities often enough to become cultural practice, and accepted for that reason. Young women are the main victims of such acts, although men can be affected.&lt;ref name="NHS Traditional"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gbv.scot.nhs.uk/gbv/harmful-traditional-practices|title=National Gender Based Violence &amp; Health Programme|website=Gbv.scot.nhs.uk|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They occur in an environment where women and girls have unequal rights and opportunities.&lt;ref name="ohchr.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/FactSheet23en.pdf|format=PDF|title=Fact Sheet No.23, Harmful Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of Women and Children|website=Ohchr.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These practices include, according to the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]]:&lt;ref name="ohchr.org" /&gt;

{{Quote|[[female genital mutilation]] (FGM); forced feeding of women; early marriage; the various taboos or practices which prevent women from controlling their own fertility; nutritional taboos and traditional birth practices; son preference and its implications for the status of the girl child; female infanticide; early pregnancy; and dowry price}}

Son preference refers to a cultural preference for sons over daughters, and manifests itself through practices such as sex selective abortion; female infanticide; or abandonment, neglect or abuse of girl-children.&lt;ref name="ohchr.org" /&gt;

Abuses regarding nutrition are taboos in regard to certain foods, which result in poor nutrition of women, and may endanger their health, especially if pregnant.&lt;ref name="ohchr.org" /&gt;

The [[caste system in India]] which leads to [[untouchability]] (the practice of ostracizing a group by segregating them from the mainstream society) often interacts with gender discrimination, leading to a double discrimination faced by [[Dalit]] women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cerd/docs/ngos/chrgj-hrw.pdf|format=PDF|title=CASTE DISCRIMINATION AGAINST DALITS OR SO-CALLED UNTOUCHABLES IN INDIA|website=2.ohchr.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2014 survey, 27% of Indians admitted to practicing untouchability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/one-in-four-indians-admit-to-practising-untouchability-biggest-caste-survey/|title=Biggest caste survey: One in four Indians admit to practising untouchability|date=29 November 2014|newspaper=[[The Indian Express]]|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional customs regarding birth sometimes endanger the mothers. Births in parts of Africa are often attended by traditional birth attendants (TBAs), who sometimes perform rituals that are dangerous to the health of the mother. In many societies, a difficult labour is believed to be a divine punishment for marital infidelity, and such women face abuse and are pressured to "confess" to the infidelity.&lt;ref name="ohchr.org" /&gt;

Tribal traditions can be harmful to males; for instance, the [[Satere-Mawe]] tribe use [[bullet ant]]s as an [[initiation rite]]. Men must wear gloves with hundreds of bullet ants woven in for ten minutes: the ants' stings cause severe pain and paralysis. This experience must be completed twenty times for boys to be considered "warriors".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/travel/Holidays/Wildlife/article77936.ece|title=Bitten by the Amazon|last=Backshall|first=Steve|date=6 January 2008|publisher=The Sunday Times|location=London|accessdate=13 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other harmful traditional practices include [[marriage by abduction]], ritualized [[sexual slavery]] ([[Devadasi]], [[Trokosi]]), [[breast ironing]] and [[widow inheritance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.krepublishers.com/02-Journals/T-Anth/Anth-13-0-000-11-Web/Anth-13-2-000-11-Abst-Pdf/Anth-13-2-121-11-720-Wadesango-N/Anth-13-2-121-11-720-Wadesango-N-Tt.pdf|format=PDF|title=Violation of Women's Rights by Harmful Traditional Practices|author1=Newman Wadesango|author2= Symphorosa Rembe|author3=Owence Chabaya|website=Krepublishers.com|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/egm/elim-disc-viol-girlchild/ExpertPapers/EP.4%20%20%20Raswork.pdf|format=PDF|title=The impact of harmful traditional practices on the girl child|website=Un.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/CEDAW/HarmfulPractices/GenderEmpowermentandDevelopment.pdf|format=PDF|title=Breast Ironing...

=====Female genital mutilation=====
[[File:Campaign_road_sign_against_female_genital_mutilation_(cropped)_2.jpg|thumb|left|Road sign near [[Kapchorwa]], [[Uganda]], 2004]]
[[UNFPA]] and [[UNICEF]] regard the practice of [[female genital mutilation]] as "a manifestation of deeply entrenched gender inequality. It persists for many reasons. In some societies, for example, it is considered a rite of passage. In others, it is seen as a prerequisite for marriage. In some communities – whether Christian, Jewish, Muslim – the practice may even be attributed to religious beliefs." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/female-genital-mutilation|title=Female genital mutilation: UNFPA – United Nations Population Fund|website=Unfpa.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An estimated 125 million women and girls living today have undergone FGM in the 29 countries where data exist. Of these, about half live in Egypt and Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/publications/unfpa-unicef-joint-programme-female-genital-mutilationcutting-accelerating-change|title=UNFPA-UNICEF Joint Programme on Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting: Accelerating Change|website=Unfpa.org|accessdate=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is most commonly carried out on girls between infancy and 15 years old.&lt;ref name="NHS Traditional" /&gt;

=====Forced marriage=====
[[File:Girl Summit - 22nd July in London (14498368279).jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|Poster against child and forced marriage]]
{{Main|Forced marriage}}
Early marriage, child marriage or [[forced marriage]] is prevalent in parts of Asia and Africa. The majority of victims seeking advice are female and aged between 18 and 23.&lt;ref name="NHS Traditional" /&gt; Such marriages can have harmful effects on a girl's education and development, and may expose girls to social isolation or abuse.&lt;ref name="ohchr.org" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/protection/57929_58008.html|title=Child marriage|date=22 October 2014|website=UNICEF|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/topic/womens-rights/child-marriage|title=Child Marriage|website=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2013 UN Resolution on Child, Early and Forced Marriage calls for an end to the practice, and states that "Recognizing that child, early and forced marriage is a harmful practice that violates abuses, or impairs human rights and is linked to and perpetuates other harmful practices and human rights violations, that these violations have a disproportionately negative impact on women and girls [...]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/pmnch/media/events/2014/child_marriage.pdf?ua=1|format=PDF|title=Resolution adopted by the General Assembly : 69/XX. Child, Early and Forced Marriage|website=Who.int|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite a near-universal commitment by governments to end child marriage, "one in three girls in developing countries (excluding China) will probably be married before they are 18."&lt;ref name="unfpa.org2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/end-child-marriage|title=End Child Marriage|website = UNFPA – United Nations Population Fund|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNFPA]] states that, "over 67 million women 20–24 year old in 2010 had been married as girls. Half were in Asia, one-fifth in Africa. In the next decade 14.2 million girls under 18 will be married every year; this translates into 39,000 girls married each day. This will rise to an average of 15.1 million girls a year, starting in 2021 until 2030, if present trends continue."&lt;ref name="unfpa.org2" /&gt;

=====Bride price=====
{{Main|Bride price}}
[[Bride price]] (also called bridewealth or bride token) is money, property, or other form of wealth paid by a groom or his family to the parents of the bride. This custom often leads to women having reduced ability to control their fertility. For instance, in northern Ghana, the payment of bride price signifies a woman's requirement to bear children, and women using birth control face threats, violence and reprisals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popcouncil.org/uploads/pdfs/councilarticles/sfp/SFP301Bawah.pdf|format=PDF|title=Women's Fears and Men's Anxieties : The Impact of Family Planning on Gender Relations in Northern Ghana|website=Popcouncil.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The custom of bride price has been criticized as contributing to the mistreatment of women in marriage, and preventing them from leaving abusive marriages. [[UN Women]] recommended its abolition, and stated that: "Legislation should [...] State that divorce shall not be contingent upon the return of bride price but such provisions shall not be interpreted to limit women’s right to divorce; State that a perpetrator of [[domestic violence]], including marital rape, cannot use the fact that he paid bride price as a defence to a domestic violence charge."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The custom of bride price can also curtail the free movement of women: if a wife wants to leave her husband, he may demand back the bride price that he had paid to the woman's family; and the woman's family often cannot or does not want to pay it back, making it difficult for women to move out of violent husbands' homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Equality Now (2007) Protecting the girl child: Using the law to end child, early and forced marriage and related human rights violations|url=http://www.equalitynow.org/sites/default/files/Protecting_the_Girl_Child.pdf|format=PDF|website=Equalitynow.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lelieveld, M.|date=2011|title=Child protection in the Somali region of Ethiopia.

====Gendered arrangements of work and care====
{{Main article|Women's work|Gender role}}
Since the 1950s, social scientists as well as feminists have increasingly criticized gendered arrangements of work and care and the male breadwinner role.

Western countries with a strong emphasis on women fulfilling the role of homemakers, rather than a professional role, include parts of German speaking Europe (i.e. parts of Germany, Austria and Switzerland); as well as the Netherlands and Ireland.{{Refn|In 2011, [[Jose Manuel Barroso]], then president of the [[European Commission]], stated "Germany, but also Austria and the Netherlands, should look at the example of the northern countries [...] that means removing obstacles for women, older workers, foreigners and low-skilled job-seekers to get into the workforce".&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/germanys-persistently-low-birthrate-gets-marginal-boost/a-15325123-0|title=Germany's persistently low birthrate gets marginal boost |date=18 August 2011 |website=Deutsche Welle |accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}}{{Refn|The Netherlands and Ireland are among the last Western countries to accept women as professionals; despite the Netherlands having an image as progressive on gender issues, women in the Netherlands work less in paid employment than women in other comparable Western countries.

A key issue towards insuring gender equality in the workplace is the respecting of [[maternity rights]] and [[reproductive rights]] of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/Handlers/Download.ashx?IDMF=a40b96ed-8bf4-4db1-9ceb-71ca2d6fada4 |title=Modern workplaces, maternity rights, and gender equality  |accessdate=2016-04-26 |deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509134200/http://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Modern-Workplaces-Policy-Position-November-2012.pdf |archivedate=2016-05-09 |publisher = Fawcett Society |date = November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Different countries have different rules regarding [[maternity leave]], paternity leave and [[parental leave]].{{Refn|In the [[European Union]] (EU) the policies vary significantly by country, but the EU members must abide by the minimum standards of the [[Pregnant Workers Directive]] and [[Parental Leave Directive]].&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice/gender-equality/rights/work-life-balance/index_en.htm|title=Professional, private and family life – European Commission|website=Ec.europa.eu|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}} Another important issue is ensuring that employed women are not ''[[de jure]]'' or ''[[de facto]]'' prevented from having a child.{{Refn|For example, some countries have enacted legislation explicitly outlawing or restricting what they view as abusive clauses in [[employment contract]]s regarding reproductive rights (such as clauses which stipulate that a woman cannot get pregnant during a specified time) rendering such contracts [[void (law)|void]] or [[voidable]].&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160509070119/http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/web/file?uuid=d01c336a-95bd-4b7d-b291-59623c7918be&amp;owner=8318a38b-02db-4343-8ee4-c81474278688]&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}} In some countries, employers ask women to sign formal or informal documents stipulating that they will not get pregnant or face legal punishment.&lt;ref&gt;For example, {{cite web|title=Law n. 202/2002, Art. 10 (4) and Art. 37|url=http://www.dreptonline.ro/legislatie/legea_egalitatii_sanse_femei.php|website=Romanian Law Online|language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women often face severe violations of their reproductive rights at the hands of their employers; and the [[International Labour Organization]] classifies [[forced abortion]] coerced by the employer as [[Exploitation of labour|labour exploitation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/@ed_norm/@declaration/documents/publication/wcms_105035.pdf|title=Details of indicators for labour exploitation|website=Ilo.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Refn|Being the victim of a forced abortion compelled by the employer was ruled a ground of obtaining [[political asylum]] in the US.&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6729339.stm|title=US asylum rule on forced abortion|website=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}} Other abuses include routine [[virginity test]]s of unmarried employed women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/hrw-calls-on-indonesia-to-scrap-virginity-tests-for-female-police/a-18082547|title=HRW calls on Indonesia to scrap 'virginity tests' for female police|website=Dw.com|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igfm-muenchen.de/tibet/Phayul/2006/TWA-CEDAWReport_Aug2006_form.pdf|format=PDF|title=THE CONVENTION ON THE ELIMINATION OF ALL FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN (CEDAW)|website=Igfm-muenchen.de|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Freedom of movement====
[[File:Group of Women Wearing Burkas.jpg|thumb|Women in [[Afghanistan]] wearing [[burqa]]s. Some clothes that women are required to wear, by law or custom, can restrict their movements]]
{{Further|Freedom of movement}}
The degree to which women can participate (in law and in practice) in public life varies by culture and socioeconomic characteristics. [[Seclusion]] of women within the home was a common practice among the [[upper classes]] of many societies, and this still remains the case today in some societies. Before the 20th century it was also common in parts of Southern Europe, such as much of Spain.&lt;ref&gt;''Liberating Women's History:Theoretical and Critical Essays'', edited by Berenice A. Carroll, pp. 161–2&lt;/ref&gt;

Women's [[freedom of movement]] continues to be legally restricted in some parts of the world. This restriction is often due to [[marriage laws]].{{Refn|For instance, in [[Yemen]], marriage regulations stipulate that a wife must obey her husband and must not leave home without his permission.&lt;ref name="www2.ohchr.org" group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/docs/ngos/Yemen%27s%20darkside-discrimination_Yemen_HRC101.pdf|title=Yemen's Dark Side: Discrimination and violence against women and girls.|website=2.ohchr.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}} In some countries, women must legally be accompanied by their male guardians (such as the husband or male relative) when they leave home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/24691034|title=Why can't women drive in Saudi Arabia?|publisher=BBC|accessdate=14 June 2015|date = 27 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) states at Article 15 (4) that:
{{Quote|4. States Parties shall accord to men and women the same rights with regard to the law relating to the movement of persons and the freedom to choose their residence and domicile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm |title=CEDAW 29th Session 30 June to 25 July 2003 |publisher= |accessdate=14 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xc2eRFDv?url=http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm |archivedate=April 1, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In addition to laws, women's freedom of movement is also restricted by social and religious norms.{{Refn|For example, [[purdah]], a religious and social practice of female seclusion prevalent among some Muslim communities in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]] as well as upper-caste Hindus in [[North India|Northern India]], such as the [[Rajputs]], which often leads to the minimizing of the movement of women in public spaces and restrictions on their social and professional interactions;&lt;ref name=Papanek group=upper-roman&gt;Papanek, Hanna.

====Girls' access to education====
[[File:Girls lining up for class - Flickr - Al Jazeera English.jpg|thumb|School girls in [[Gaza Strip]]]]
{{Main article|Female education|Gender and education}}
In many parts of the world, girls' access to education is very restricted. In developing parts of the world women are often denied opportunities for education as girls and women face many obstacles. These include: early and forced marriages; early pregnancy; prejudice based on gender stereotypes at home, at school and in the community; violence on the way to school, or in and around schools; long distances to schools; vulnerability to the HIV epidemic; school fees, which often lead to parents sending only their sons to school; lack of gender sensitive approaches and materials in classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teachers.org.uk/node/12978|title=Global issues affecting women and girls |website=National Union of Teachers|accessdate=14 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429020903/http://www.teachers.org.uk/node/12978|archivedate=29 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campaignforeducationusa.org/obstacles-to-education-for-girls-and-women|title=Global Campaign For Education United States Chapter|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plan-international.org/files/Africa/progress-and-obstacles-to-girls-education-in-africa|title=Progress and Obstacles to Girls' Education in Africa|website=Plan International|date = 16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[OHCHR]], there have been multiple attacks on schools worldwide during the period 2009–2014 with "a number of these attacks being specifically directed at girls, parents and teachers advocating for gender equality in education".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=15555&amp;LangID=E|title=Attacks against girls' education occurring with "increasing regularity" – UN human rights report|last=|first=|date=9 February 2015|website=Ohchr.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations Population Fund]] says:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/gender-equality|title=Gender equality|website=[[United Nations Population Fund]]|accessdate=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|About two thirds of the world's [[Literacy#Gender disparities|illiterate]] adults are women. Lack of an education severely restricts a woman's access to information and opportunities. Conversely, increasing women's and girls' educational attainment benefits both individuals and future generations. Higher levels of women's education are strongly associated with lower infant mortality and lower fertility, as well as better outcomes for their children.}}

====Marriage, divorce and property laws and regulations====
Equal rights for women in marriage, divorce, and property/land ownership and inheritance are essential for gender equality. The Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) has called for the end of discriminatory [[family law]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/Equalityinfamilyrelationsrecognizingwomensrightstoproperty.aspx|title=Equality in family relations: recognizing women's rights to property|website=Ohchr.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, UN Women stated that "While at least 115 countries recognize equal land rights for women and men, effective implementation remains a major challenge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2013/11/womens-land-rights-are-human-rights-says-new-un-report|title = Women's land rights are human rights, says new UN report |date = 11 November 2013|website = UN Women}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal and social treatment of married women has been often discussed as a political issue from the 19th century onwards.{{Refn|[[John Stuart Mill]], in ''[[The Subjection of Women]]'' (1869) compared marriage to [[slavery]] and wrote that: "The law of servitude in marriage is a monstrous contradiction to all the principles of the modern world, and to all the experience through which those principles have been slowly and painfully worked out."&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mill-john-stuart/1869/subjection-women/ch04.htm|title=The Subjection of Women by John Stuart Mill|website=Marxists.org|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}}{{Refn|In 1957, James Everett, then Minister for Justice in Ireland, stated: "The progress of organised society is judged by the status occupied by married women".&lt;ref name=Oireachtas group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web |url= http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad1957011600008?opendocument |title= Married Women's Status Bill, 1956—Second Stage: Minister for Justice (Mr. Everett) |website= [[Houses of the Oireachtas|Oireachtas]] |date= 16 January 1957}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}} Until the 1970s, legal subordination of married women was common across European countries, through [[marriage laws]] giving legal authority to the husband, as well as through [[marriage bar]]s.{{Refn|In France, married women obtained the right to work without their husband's consent in 1965;&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/explore/cmcf-vsi-women-in-france.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304092212/http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/explore/cmcf-vsi-women-in-france.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the paternal authority of a man over his family was ended in 1970 (before that parental responsibilities belonged solely to the father who made all legal decisions concerning the children); and a new reform in 1985 abolished the stipulation that the father had the sole power to administer the children's property.&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ceflonline.net/wp-content/uploads/France-Parental-Responsibilities.pdf|title=National Report: France|website=Ceflonline.net|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}}{{Refn|In [[Austria]], the marriage law was overhauled between 1975 and 1983, abolishing the restrictions on married women's right to work outside the home, providing for equality between spouses, and for joint ownership of property and assets.&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;''Women and Politics in Contemporary Ireland: From the Margins to the Mainstream'', by Yvonne Galligan, pp.90&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}} In 1978, the [[Council of Europe]] passed the ''Resolution (78) 37 on equality of spouses in civil law''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RESOLUTION   (78)  37 ON   EQUALITY   OF   SPOUSES  IN   CIVIL   LAW|url=https://wcd.coe.int/com.instranet.InstraServlet?command=com.instranet.CmdBlobGet&amp;InstranetImage=596422&amp;SecMode=1&amp;DocId=662346&amp;Usage=2|publisher=Council of Europe|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160121025014/https://wcd.coe.int/com.instranet.InstraServlet?command=com.instranet.CmdBlobGet&amp;InstranetImage=596422&amp;SecMode=1&amp;DocId=662346&amp;Usage=2|archivedate=21 January 2016|date=27  September  1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Switzerland]] was one of the last countries in Europe to establish gender equality in marriage, in this country married women's rights were severely restricted until 1988, when legal reforms providing for gender equality in marriage, abolishing the legal authority of the husband, come into force (these reforms had been approved in 1985 by voters in a [[Voting in Switzerland|referendum]], who narrowly voted in favor with 54.7% of voters approving).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/23/world/swiss-grant-women-equal-marriage-rights.html|title=SWISS GRANT WOMEN EQUAL MARRIAGE RIGHTS|date=23 September 1985|website=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17988450|title=Switzerland Profile: Timeline|website=BBC News|date = 21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch/chronology-womens-right-vote-switzerland.html|title=The Long Way to Women's Right to Vote in Switzerland: a Chronology|author=Markus G.

There have been and sometimes continue to be unequal treatment of married women in various aspects of everyday life. For example, in [[Australia]], until 1983 a husband had to authorize an application for an [[Australian passport]] for a married woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.passports.gov.au/Web/passport_history.aspx|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614171552/http://www.passports.gov.au/Web/passport_history.aspx|title=The History of Passports in Australia|archivedate=14 June 2006|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other practices have included, and in many countries continue to include, a requirement for a husband's consent for an application for bank loans and credit cards by a married woman, as well as restrictions on the wife's [[reproductive rights]], such as a requirement that the husband consents to the wife's acquiring [[contraception]] or having an [[abortion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnesty.ca/sites/default/files/womens_lives_womens_rights_campaigning.pdf|title=Women's Lives Women's Rights: Campaigning for maternal health and sexual and reproductive rights.|website=Amnesty.ca|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cedaw/docs/ngos/AmnestyInternational_for_PSWG_en_Indonesia.pdf|format=PDF|title=Left without a choice : Barriers to reproductive health in Indonesia|website=2.ohchr.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some places, although the law itself no longer requires the consent of the husband for various actions taken by the wife, the practice continues ''[[de facto]]'', with the authorization of the husband being asked in practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Education For Women|first =D.

=== Social and ideological ===

==== Political Gender Equality ====
Two recent movements in countries with large Kurdish populations have implemented political gender equality. One has been the Kurdish movement in southeastern Turkey led by the [[Democratic Regions Party]] (DBP) and the [[Peoples' Democratic Party (Turkey)|Peoples' Democratic Party]] (HDP),&lt;!-- The apostrophe is correctly placed. The party is pro-minority, and the name is also translated as Democratic Party of the People{{uu|s}} --&gt; from 2006 or before.
The mayorships of 2 metropolitan areas and 97 towns{{citation needed|date=January 2018|reason= The citation was to [[Turkish local elections, 2014]]. See [[WP:CIRC]] and [[Talk:Gender equality#new section Political Gender Equality|Political Gender Equality]].}} are led jointly by a man and a woman, both called co-mayors. Party offices are also led by a man and a woman. Local councils were formed, which also had to be co-presided over by a man and a woman together. However, in November 2016 the Turkish government cracked down on the HDP, jailing ten of its members of Parliament, including the party's male and female co-leaders.&lt;ref name=Nordland&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/07/world/middleeast/turkey-kurds-womens-rights.html |title=Crackdown in Turkey Threatens a Haven of Gender Equality Built by Kurds |last=Nordland |first=Rod| date=2016-12-07|work=The New York Times |access-date=2018-01-23|language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See|Gender role}}
Gender [[stereotype]]s arise from the socially approved roles of women and men in the private or public sphere, at home or in the workplace. In the household, women are typically seen as mother figures, which usually places them into a typical classification of being "supportive" or "nurturing". Women are expected to want to take on the role of a mother and take on primary responsibility for household needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women Voices and Feminist Visions|last=Shaw and Lee|first=Susan and Janet|year=|isbn=|location=|page=450|quote="Women are expected to want to be mothers"|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their male counterparts are seen as being "assertive" or "ambitious" as men are usually seen in the workplace or as the primary breadwinner for his family.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geteverwise.com/human-resources/how-does-gender-bias-really-affect-women-in-the-workplace/|title=How Does Gender Bias Really Affect Women in the Workplace?|date=2016-03-24|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to these views and expectations, women often face discrimination in the public sphere, such as the workplace.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

A [[gender role]] is a set of societal [[norm (social)|norms]] dictating the types of behaviors which are generally considered acceptable, appropriate, or desirable for people based on their sex. Gender roles are usually centered on conceptions of [[femininity]] and [[masculinity]], although there are [[Third gender|exceptions]] and [[genderqueer|variations]].

====Portrayal of women in the media====
{{Main article|Exploitation of women in mass media}}
The way women are represented in the media has been criticized as perpetuating negative gender stereotypes. The [[exploitation of women in mass media]] refers to the criticisms that are levied against the use or objectification of women in the [[mass media]], when such use or portrayal aims at increasing the appeal of media or a product, to the detriment of, or without regard to, the interests of the women portrayed, or women in general. Concerns include the fact that all forms of media have the power to shape the population's perceptions and portray images of unrealistic stereotypical perceptions by portraying women either as submissive housewives or as sex objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/etudes/join/2013/474442/IPOL-FEMM_ET%282013%29474442_EN.pdf|format=PDF|title=Women and Girls as Subjects of Media's Attention and Advertisement Campaigns : The Situation in Europe, Best Practices and Legislations|website=Europarl.europa.eu|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The media emphasizes traditional domestic or sexual roles that normalize violence against women. The vast array of studies that have been conducted on the issue of the portrayal of women in the media have shown that women are often portrayed as irrational, fragile, not intelligent, submissive and
subservient to men.&lt;ref name="Acevedo 2010"&gt;Acevedo et all. 2010. 'A Content Analysis of the Roles Portrayed by Women in Commercials: 1973 – 2008', Revista Brasileira de Marketing Vol. 9. Universidade Nove de Julho, Sao Paulo.&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that stereotyped images such as these have been shown to negatively impact on the mental health of many female viewers who feel bound by these roles, causing amongst other problems, self-esteem issues, depression and anxiety.&lt;ref name="Acevedo 2010"/&gt;

According to a study, the way women are often portrayed by the media can lead to:  "Women of average or normal appearance feeling inadequate or less beautiful in comparison to the overwhelming use of extraordinarily attractive women"; "Increase in the likelihood and acceptance of sexual violence"; "Unrealistic expectations by men of how women should look or behave"; "Psychological disorders such as body dysmorphic disorder, anorexia, bulimia and so on"; "The importance of physical appearance is emphasized and reinforced early in most girls' development." Studies have found that nearly half of females ages 6–8 have stated they want to be slimmer. (Striegel-Moore &amp; Franko, 2002)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westminstercollege.edu/myriad/index.cfm?parent=...&amp;detail=4475&amp;content=4795|title=The Myriad: Westminster's Interactive Academic Journal|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428172944/http://www.westminstercollege.edu/myriad/index.cfm?parent=...&amp;detail=4475&amp;content=4795|archivedate=2016-04-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/gretchen-kelly/the-thing-all-women-do-you-dont-know-about_b_8630416.html|title=The Thing All Women Do That You Don't Know About|author=Gretchen Kelly|publisher=[[Huffington Post]]|date=November 23, 2015|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Informing women of their rights====
While in many countries, the problem lies in the lack of adequate legislation, in others the principal problem is not as much the lack of a legal framework, but the fact is that most women do not know their legal rights. This is especially the case as many of the laws dealing with women's rights are of recent date. This lack of knowledge enables to abusers to lead the victims (explicitly or implicitly) to believe that their abuse is within their rights.

====Gender mainstreaming====
{{Main article|Gender mainstreaming}}
Gender mainstreaming is described as the [[public policy]] of assessing the different implications for women and men of any planned [[policy]] action, including [[legislation]] and [[Program (management)|programmes]], in all areas and levels, with the aim of achieving gender equality.&lt;ref&gt;Booth, C. and Bennett, (2002) "Gender Mainstreaming in the European Union", ''European Journal of Women's Studies'' 9 (4): 430–46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/gender/newsite2002/about/defin.htm|title=Definition of Gender Mainstreaming|website=International Labor Organization|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of gender mainstreaming was first proposed at the 1985 Third World Conference on Women in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]]. The idea has been developed in the [[United Nations]] development community.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20010708124202/http://www.jeanmonnetprogram.org/papers/00/000201-03.html II. The Origins of Gender Mainstreaming in the EU]", ''[http://www.jeanmonnetprogram.org/ Academy of European Law online]''&lt;/ref&gt; Gender mainstreaming "involves ensuring that gender perspectives and attention to the goal of gender equality are central to all activities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/osagi/gendermainstreaming.htm|title=Gender Mainstreaming|website=UN Women|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Council of Europe definition: "Gender mainstreaming is the (re)organization, improvement, development and evaluation of policy processes, so that a gender equality perspective is incorporated in all policies at all levels and at all stages, by the actors normally involved in policy-making."&lt;ref name="coe.int"/&gt;

An integrated gender mainstreaming approach is "the attempt to form alliances and common platforms that bring together the power of faith and gender-equality aspirations to advance human rights."&lt;ref name="unfpa.org3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/publications/gender-heart-icpd|title=Gender at the Heart of ICPD: The UNFPA Strategic Framework on Gender Mainstreaming and Women's Empowerment |website=United Nations Population Fund|date = 2011|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, "in Azerbaijan, [[UNFPA]] conducted a study on gender equality by comparing the text of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women with some widely recognized Islamic references and resources. The results reflect the parallels between the Convention and many tenets of Islamic scripture and practice. The study showcased specific issues, including VAW, child marriage, respect for the dignity of women, and equality in the economic and political participation of women. The study was later used to produce training materials geared towards sensitizing religious leaders."&lt;ref name="unfpa.org3"/&gt;

'''Georg Henrik von Wright''' ({{IPA-sv|ˈjeːɔrj ˈhɛnːrɪk fɔn ˈvrɪkːt|lang}}; 14 June 1916 &amp;ndash; 16 June 2003) was a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[philosopher]], who succeeded [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] as professor at the [[University of Cambridge]]. He published in [[English language|English]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[German language|German]], and [[Swedish language|Swedish]], having belonged to the [[Finland Swedish|Swedish-speaking]] minority of Finland. Von Wright was of both Finnish and 17th-century [[Scottish people|Scottish]] ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://suvut.genealogia.fi/wrights/JohanPetterWrightinjaNilsWrightinjalkelaisia.pdf |title=Georg Wrightin jälkeläisiä |publisher=suvut.genealogia.fi |accessdate=April 24, 2009 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720181246/http://suvut.genealogia.fi/wrights/JohanPetterWrightinjaNilsWrightinjalkelaisia.pdf |archivedate=July 20, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Von Wright's writings come under two broad categories. The first is [[analytic philosophy]] and [[philosophical logic]] in the Anglo-American vein. His 1951 books, ''An Essay in Modal Logic'' and ''Deontic Logic'', were landmarks in the postwar rise of formal modal logic and its [[deontic logic|deontic]] version. He was an authority on Wittgenstein, editing his later works. He was the leading figure in the Finnish philosophy of his time, specializing in philosophical logic, [[philosophical analysis]], [[philosophy of action]], [[philosophy of language]], [[philosophy of mind]], and the close study of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]].

The other vein in von Wright's writings is [[morality|moralist]] and [[pessimism|pessimist]]. During the last twenty years of his life, under the influence of [[Oswald Spengler]], [[Jürgen Habermas]] and the [[Frankfurt School]]'s reflections about modern [[Rationality]], he wrote prolifically. His best known article from this period is entitled ''The Myth of Progress'', and it questions whether our apparent material and technological progress can really be considered "[[progress (history)|progress]]".

In the last year of his life, among his other honorary degrees, he held an [[honorary degree]] at the [[University of Bergen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nytt om navn|last=|first=|date=17 January 2002|work=Aftenposten|page=14|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also was awarded [[Swedish Academy Finland Prize]] in 1968.

'''Georgi Valentinovich Plekhanov''' ({{IPAc-en|p|l|ɪ|ˈ|k|ɑː|n|ə|f}}; {{lang-rus|Гео́ргий Валенти́нович Плеха́нов|p=ɡʲɪˈorɡʲɪj vəlʲɪnˈtʲinəvʲɪtɕ plʲɪˈxanəf|a=Ru-Georgi Plekhanov-JermyRei.ogg}}; 29 November 1856 – 30 May 1918) was a Russian revolutionary and a [[Marxist]] [[theoretician (Marxism)|theoretician]]. He was a founder of the social-democratic movement in Russia and was one of the first Russians to identify himself as "Marxist." Facing political persecution, Plekhanov emigrated to Switzerland in 1880, where he continued in his political activity attempting to overthrow the [[Tsar]]ist regime in Russia.

Although he supported the [[Bolshevik]] faction at the [[2nd Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] in 1903, Plekhanov soon rejected the idea of [[democratic centralism]], and became one of [[Lenin]] and [[Trotsky]]'s principal antagonists in the 1905 [[St. Petersburg Soviet]].

During [[World War I]] Plekhanov rallied to the cause of the [[Entente powers]] against Germany and he returned home to Russia following the [[February revolution|1917 February Revolution]]. Plekhanov was an opponent of the Soviet state which came to power in the autumn of 1917. He died the following year. Despite his vigorous and outspoken opposition to Lenin's political party in 1917, Plekhanov was held in high esteem by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] following his death as a founding father of Russian Marxism and a philosophical thinker.

==Early years==

Georgi Valentinovich Plekhanov was born 29 November 1856 (old style) in the Russian village of [[Gryazinsky District|Gudalovka]] in [[Tambov Governorate]], one of twelve siblings. Georgi's father, Valentin Plekhanov, from a [[Tatar peoples|Tatar]] family,&lt;ref&gt;''Russian Philosophy: Pre-Revolutionary Philosophy and Theology Philosophers in Exile Marxists and Communists'', Volume III (1965), p. 352&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Faubion Bowers]], ''Scriabin, a Biography'', Courier Corporation (1996), p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; was a member of the [[Russian nobility|hereditary nobility]].&lt;ref name="Father4"&gt;Samuel H. Baron, ''Plekhanov: The Father of Russian Marxism.'' Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1963; pg. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Valentin was a member of the lower stratum of the Russian nobility, the possessor of about 270 acres of land and approximately 50 [[serfs]].&lt;ref name="Father4" /&gt; Georgi's mother, Maria Feodorovna, was a distant relative of the famous literary critic [[Vissarion Belinsky]] and was married to Valentin in 1855, following the death of his first wife.&lt;ref name="Father6"&gt;Baron, ''Plekhanov: The Father of Russian Marxism,'' pg. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Georgi was the first-born of the couple's five children.&lt;ref name="Father6" /&gt;

Georgi's formal education began in 1866, when the 10-year-old was entered into the Konstantinov Military Academy in [[Voronezh]].&lt;ref name="Father6" /&gt; He remained a student at the military academy, where he was well taught by his teachers and well liked by his classmates, until 1873.&lt;ref name="Father6" /&gt; His mother later attributed her son's life as a revolutionary to liberal ideas to which he was exposed in the course of his education at the school.&lt;ref&gt;Baron, ''Plekhanov: The Father of Russian Marxism,'' pp. 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1871, Valentine Plekhanov gave up his effort to maintain his family as a small-scale landlord and accepted a job as an administrative official in a newly formed [[zemstvo]].&lt;ref name="Father4" /&gt; He died two years later but his body has been on display in the center of the commons ever since.

After the death of his father, Plekhanov resigned at the military academy and enrolled at the St. Petersburg Metallurgical Institute.&lt;ref name="Haimson31"&gt;Leopold H. Haimson, ''The Russian Marxists and the Origins of Bolshevism.'' Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1955; pg. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; There in 1875 he was introduced to a young revolutionary intellectual named [[Pavel Axelrod]], who later recalled that Plekhanov instantly made a favorable impression upon him:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"He spoke well in a business-like fashion, simply and yet in a literary way. One perceived in him a love for knowledge, a habit of reading, thinking, working. He dreamed at the time of going abroad to complete his training in [[chemistry]]. This plan didn't please me... This is a luxury! I said to the young man. If you take so long to complete your studies in chemistry, when will you begin to work for the revolution?"&lt;ref&gt;Pavel Aksel'rod, "Perezhitoe i peredumannoe," ''Letopis' revoliutsii,'' vol. 1, no. 14, Berlin, 1923. Quoted in Baron, ''Plekhanov: The Father of Russian Marxism,'' pg. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Under Axelrod's influence, Plekhanov was drawn into the [[Narodnik|populist]] movement as an activist in the primary revolutionary organization of the day, "[[Land and Liberty (Russia)|Zemlia i Volia]]" (Land and Liberty).

==Political activity==

Plekhanov was one of the organizers of the first political demonstrations in Russia. On 6 December 1876, Plekhanov delivered a fiery speech during a [[Kazan demonstration|demonstration in front of the Kazan Cathedral in St.Petersburg]] in which he indicted the [[Tsarist autocracy]] and defended the ideas of [[Nikolay Chernyshevsky|Chernyshevsky]]. Thereafter, Plekhanov was forced by the fear of retribution to lead an underground life. He was arrested twice for his political activities, in 1877 and again in 1878, but released both times after only a short time in jail.&lt;ref name="Between4"&gt;Samuel H. Baron, "Between Marx and Lenin: G.V. Plekhanov," ''Soviet Survey,'' vol. 32, no. 2 (April–June 1960); reprinted in Baron, ''Plekhanov in Russian History and Soviet Historiography,'' pp. 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although originally a Populist, after emigrating to Western Europe he established connections with the Social-Democratic movement of western Europe and began to study the works of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]]. When the question of terrorism became a matter of heated debate in the populist movement in 1879, Plekhanov cast his lot decisively with the opponents of political assassination.&lt;ref name="Haimson37"&gt;Haimson, ''The Russian Marxists and the Origins of Bolshevism,'' pg. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of historian [[Leopold Haimson]], Plekhanov "denounced terrorism as a rash and impetuous movement, which would drain the energy of the revolutionists and provoke a government repression so severe as to make any agitation among the masses impossible."&lt;ref name="Haimson37" /&gt; Plekhanov was so certain of the correctness of his views that he determined to leave the revolutionary movement altogether rather than to compromise on the matter.&lt;ref name="Haimson37" /&gt;

Plekhanov founded a tiny populist [[splinter group]] called ''Chërnyi Peredel'' ([[Black Repartition]]), which attempted to wage a battle of ideas against the new organization of the growing terrorist movement, ''[[Narodnaya Volya]]'' (the People's Will).&lt;ref name="Between5"&gt;Baron, "Between Marx and Lenin: G.V. Plekhanov," pg. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Plekhanov was manifestly unsuccessful in this effort. 

In 1879 he married Rozaliia Bograd-Plekhanova, a medical student who had been active in the Populist movement.  She accompanied him in 1880 when he left Russia for Switzerland on what was originally intended as a brief stay. It would be 37 years before he was able to return again to his native land.&lt;ref name="Between5" /&gt;

During the next three years, Plekhanov read extensively on [[political economy]], gradually coming to question his faith in the revolutionary potential of the traditional [[Obshchina|village commune]].&lt;ref&gt;Haimson, ''The Russian Marxists and the Origins of Bolshevism,'' pg. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; During these years from 1882 through 1883, Plekhanov became a convinced Marxist and in the late 1880s he established personal contact with Frederick Engels.&lt;ref&gt;V. A. Fomina, "Plekhanov's role in the Defence and Substantiation of Marxist Philosophy (Introductory Essay) contained in the ''Selected Philosophical Works: Volume I'' (Moscow: Progress Publishers, 1974) p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Plekhanov also became a committed [[centralism|centralist]] in this period, coming to believe in the efficacy of political struggle.&lt;ref name="Haimson43"&gt;Haimson, ''The Russian Marxists and the Origins of Bolshevism,'' pg. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; He decided that the struggle for a socialist future first required the development of capitalism in agrarian Russia.&lt;ref name="Haimson43"/&gt;

In September 1883 Plekhanov joined with his old friend Axelrod, [[Leo Deutsch|Lev Deutsch]], Vasily Ignatov, and [[Vera Zasulich]] in establishing the first Russian-language Marxist political organization, the ''Gruppa Osvobozhdenie Truda'' or the "[[Emancipation of Labour|Emancipation of Labor Group]]." Also in the fall of 1883, Plekhanov authored the social program of the Emancipation of Labor Group.&lt;ref&gt;Georgi Plekhanov, "Programme of the Social-Democratic Emancipation of Labor Group" contained in the ''Selected Philosophical Works: Volume 1'' (Moscow: Progress Publishers, 1974) pp. 353-357.&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Geneva, Switzerland|Geneva]], the Emancipation of Labor Group attempted to popularize the economic and historical ideas of [[Karl Marx]], in which they met with some success, attracting such eminent intellectuals as [[Peter Struve]], [[V.I. Lenin|Vladimir Ulianov (Lenin)]], [[Julius Martov|Iulii Martov]], and [[Alexander Potresov]] to the organization.&lt;ref name="Between6"&gt;Baron, "Between Marx and Lenin: G.V. Plekhanov," pg. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary activity==
It was during this period that Plekhanov began to write and publish the first of his important political works, including the [[pamphlet]] ''Socialism and Political Struggle'' (1883)&lt;ref&gt;Georgi Plekhanov, "Socialism and Political Struggle" contained in the ''Selected Philosophical Works: Volume I'' (Moscow: Progress Publishers, 1974) pp. 49-106.&lt;/ref&gt; and the full-length book ''Our Differences'' (1885).&lt;ref&gt;Georgi Phekhanov, "Our Differences" contained in ''Selected Philosophical Works: Volume I'' pp. 107-352.&lt;/ref&gt; These works first expressed the Marxist position for a Russian audience and delineated the points of departure of the Marxists from the Populist movement.&lt;ref&gt;Baron, ''Plekhanov: The Father of Russian Marxism,'' pg. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Lenin called the former, the "first ''profession de foi'' [profession of faith]of Russian socialism." Plekhanov famously noted, "... without revolutionary theory there is no revolutionary movement in the true sense of the word." In the latter book, Plekhanov emphasized that capitalism had begun to establish itself in Russia, primarily in the [[textile industry]]&lt;ref&gt;Georgi Plekhanov, "Our Differences" contained in the ''Selected Philosophical Works: Volume 1'', pp. 216-237.&lt;/ref&gt; but also in agriculture,&lt;ref&gt;Georgi Plekhanov, "Our Differences" contained in the ''Selected Philosophical Works: Volume 1'', pp. 238-274.&lt;/ref&gt; and that a working class was beginning to emerge in [[peasant]] Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Baron, ''Plekhanov: The Father of Russian Marxism,'' pp. 98-99.&lt;/ref&gt; It was this expanding working class that would ultimately and inevitably bring about socialist change in Russia, Plekhanov argued.&lt;ref&gt;Georgi Plekhanov, "Our Differences" contained in the ''Selected Philosophical Works: Volume 1'' pp. 341-342.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1895, Plekhanov published his most famous work, ''[[The Development of the Monist View of History]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Georgi Plekhanov, "The Development of the Monist View of History" contained in the ''Selected Philosophical Works: Volume 1'', pp. 480-697.&lt;/ref&gt; The book passed the censors of the Russian government and was legally published in Russia. Plekhanov wrote the book under the pseudonym Beltov and admitted to the use of the "purposely clumsy" name for the book in order to deceive the Russian censors.&lt;ref name="A. Fomina p. 16"&gt;V. A. Fomina, "Introductory Essay" contained in the ''Selected Philosophical Works: Volume 1'', p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Plekhanov's book became a very popular defense of the materialistic conception of history. Indeed, V. I. Lenin would later comment that Plekhanov's book "helped educate a whole generation of Russian Marxists."&lt;ref name="A. Fomina p. 16"/&gt; Frederick Engels commented in a 30 January 1895 letter to Vera Zasulich that Plekhanov's book had been published at a most opportune time.&lt;ref&gt;Engels' letter to Vera Zasulich dated 30 January 1895 contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 50'' (New York: International Publishers, 2004) p. 436.&lt;/ref&gt; Tsar Nicholas II had just released a statement on 29 January (or 17 January under the old Russian calendar) that announced that it was fruitless for the ''Zemstvos'', locally elected district councils, to agitate for any more democratic reforms in the Russian government.&lt;ref&gt;See note 505 contained in the ''Collected works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 50, p. 601.&lt;/ref&gt; Nicholas II had decided to return Russia to the absolute Tsarist autocracy of his father, Alexander III. The elected ''Zemstvos'', which formed a local government in the European sectors of the Russian Empire, had been initiated by Nicholas' grandfather, Tsar Alexander II in 1864.&lt;ref&gt;See note 504 in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 50'' (New York: International Publishers, 2004) p. 601.&lt;/ref&gt; Under Nicholas II's re-initiation of absolute autocracy, the ''Zemstvos'' would become superfluous and basically be abolished. Engels expected this announcement would cause an upsurge in popular protest in Russia and Engels thought the timely publication of Plekhanov's book would augment that popular protest.

Later on 8 February 1895, Engels wrote directly to Plekhanov congratulating him on the "great success" of getting the book "published ''inside the country''".&lt;ref&gt;Engels' letter to Georgi Plekhanov dated 8 February 1895 contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 50, p. 439.&lt;/ref&gt; A German Edition of the Plekhanov's book was published in Stuttgart in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;V. A. Fomina, "Introductory Essay" contained in the ''Selected Philosophical Works: Volume I'', p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1890s, Plekhanov was involved in three tasks in revolutionary literature. First, he sought to reveal the inner link between pre-Marxist French materialism and the materialism of Marx. His "Essays on the History of Materialism (1892-1893)"&lt;ref&gt;Georgi Plekhanov, "Essays on the History of Materialism" contained in the ''Selected Philosophical Works: Volume II'' (Moscow: Progress Publishers, 1976) pp. 31-182.&lt;/ref&gt; dealt with the French materialists—Paul Holbach and Claude-Adrien Helvètius. Plekhanov defended both Helvètius and Holbach from attacks by Friedrich Albert Lange, Jules-Auguste Soury and the other neo-Kantian idealist philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;Georgi Plekhanov, "Essays on the History of Materialism" contained in the ''Selected Philosophical Works: Volume II'', pp. 40-41 and 79-80.&lt;/ref&gt; In this series of writings, Plekhanov was careful to place special emphasis on the revolutionary nature of the Marxists' philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;B. A. Chagin, "G. V. Plekhanov's Defence and substantiation of Dialectical and Historical Materialism in the Struggle Against Revisionism" as the "Introduction" contained Georgi Plekhanov's ''Selected Philosophical Works: Volume II" (Moscow: Progress Publishers, 1976) p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Plekhanov not only found materialism to be the motor force in history, but went on to outline a particular type of materialism—the "economic determinism model of materialism as the specific element that moved history."&lt;ref&gt;See Georgi Plekhanov "A Few Words in Defence of Economic Materialism" and "On the Economic Factor" contained in the ''Selected Philosophical Works: Volume II'', pp. 183-210 and 251-282.&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondly, Plekhanov outlined a history of materialism and its struggle against bourgeois ideologists.&lt;ref&gt;"B. A. Chagin, "Introduction" contained in Georgi Plekhanov's ''Selected Philosophical Works: Volume II'', p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Bourgeois philosophers of the "great man theory of history" came under attack from Plekhanov from the economic determinist point of view in his 1898 book entitled "On the Individual's Role in History."&lt;ref&gt;Georgi Plekhanov, ''Selected Philosophical Works: Volume II'', pp. 283-315.&lt;/ref&gt; Thirdly, Plekhanov defended revolutionary Marxism against the revisionist critics—Eduard Bernstein, Pyotr Struve, ''etc''.&lt;ref&gt;B. A. Chagin, "Introduction" contained in Georgi Plekhanov's ''Selected Philosophical Works: Volume II'', p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1900, Plekhanov, Axelrod, Zasulich, Lenin, Potresov, and Martov joined forces to establish a Marxist newspaper, ''[[Iskra]]'' (The Spark).&lt;ref name="Between6" /&gt; The paper was intended to serve as a vehicle to unite various independent local Marxist groups into a single unified organization.&lt;ref name="Between6" /&gt; From this effort emerged the [[Russian Social-Democratic Labor Party]] (RSDLP), an [[umbrella group]] which soon split into hostile [[Bolshevik Party|Bolshevik]] and [[Menshevik Party|Menshevik]] political organizations.

In 1903, at the [[Second Congress of the RSDLP]], Plekhanov initially sided with Lenin, ironic given his later politics.

Plekhanov came to regret his remarks on the subordination of democracy to a proletarian dictatorship:

"The success of the revolution is the highest law. And if the success of the revolution demands a temporary limitation on the working of this or that democratic principle, then it would be criminal to refrain from such a limitation...The revolutionary proletariat might limit the political rights of the higher classes ...If in a burst of revolutionary enthusiasm the people chose a very fine parliament ...then we would make of it a long parliament ; and if the elections turned out unsuccessfully then we would have to try to disperse it."&lt;ref&gt;Tony Cliff, Lenin: Building the Party, pp 104-5&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[1905 Russian Revolution|Russian Revolution of 1905]], Plekhanov was unrelenting in his criticism of Lenin and the Bolsheviks, charging that they failed to understand the historically-determined limits of revolution and to base their tactics upon actual conditions.&lt;ref name="HistoryXIV"&gt;Samuel H. Baron, ''Plekhanov in Russian History and Soviet Historiography.'' Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press, 1995; pg. xiv.&lt;/ref&gt; He believed the Bolsheviks were acting contrary to objective laws of history, which called for a stage of capitalist development before the establishment of socialist society would be possible in economically and socially backwards Russia and characterized the expansive goals of his radical opponents' "political hallucinations."&lt;ref name="HistoryXIV" /&gt;

Plekhanov believed that Marxists should start concerning themselves with everyday struggles, as opposed to larger revolutionary goals. In order for this to occur, the [[Russian Social-Democratic Labor Party]] organizations had to be run democratically.&lt;ref&gt;name="Stalinism and the Politics of Mobilization"&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite their sharp differences, Plekhanov was recognized, even in his own lifetime, as having made a great contribution to Marxist philosophy and literature by V.I. Lenin. "The services he rendered in the past," Lenin wrote of Plekhanov, "were immense. During the twenty years between 1883 and 1903 he wrote a large number of splendid essays, especially those against the [[Opportunism|opportunists]], [[Ernst Mach|Machists]], and [[Narodnik]]s." Even after the [[October Revolution]] Lenin insisted on republishing Plekhanov's philosophical works and including these works as compulsory texts for prospective communists.

It seems that Plekhanov, although a revolutionary figure, had not taken the view that art must serve political ends. He himself criticized Chernyshevsky for his view of art, that art must be propagandist; he, rather, declared that only art which serves history, not transient pleasure, is valuable.

==War years==

With the outbreak of [[World War I]], Plekhanov became an outspoken supporter of the [[Entente powers]], for which he was derided as a so-called "[[Social patriotism|Social Patriot]]" by Lenin and his associates. Plekhanov was convinced that German [[imperialism]] was at fault for the war and he was convinced that German victory in the conflict would be an unmitigated disaster for the European working class.&lt;ref name="Dict"&gt;Samuel H. Baron, "Georgii Valentinovich Plekhanov," in George Jackson with Robert Devlin (eds.), ''Dictionary of the Russian Revolution.'' Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1989; pp. 447-449.&lt;/ref&gt;

Plekhanov was initially dismayed by the [[February Revolution]] of 1917, considering it as an event which disorganized Russia's war effort.&lt;ref name="Dict" /&gt; He soon came to terms with the event, however, conceiving of it as a long-anticipated [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]]-democratic revolution which would ultimately bolster flagging popular support for the war effort and he returned home to Russia.&lt;ref name="Dict" /&gt;

Plekhanov was extremely hostile to the Bolshevik Party headed by V.I. Lenin and was the top leader of the tiny [[Yedinstvo]] group, which published a newspaper by the same name.&lt;ref name="Dict" /&gt; He criticized Lenin's revolutionary [[April Theses]] as "ravings" and called Lenin himself an "alchemist of revolution" for his seeming willingness to leap over the stage of capitalist development in agrarian Russia in advocating socialist revolution.&lt;ref name="Dict" /&gt; Plekhanov lent support to the idea that Lenin was a "German agent" and urged the [[Provisional Government]] of [[Alexander Kerensky]] to take severe repressive measures against the Bolshevik organization to halt its political machinations.&lt;ref name="Dict" /&gt;

==Marriage==
In 1879, Plekhanov married Rozalia Bograd, who accompanied him into exile in Switzerland in 1880.  They had four daughters, two of whom died in childhood. Rozalia was born in 1856 in the Jewish colony of Dobroe in [[Kherson Oblast]] (present day [[Ukraine]] but at that time part of the Russian Empire). She trained as a doctor in [[Saint Petersburg]] (medical courses for women were first opened in 1873) and joined the ranks of the Populists or [[Narodniks]], spending the summer of 1877 in the village of Shirokoe in [[Samara Oblast]] where she sought (without very much success) to raise the political consciousness of the local peasantry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Russia in the Age of Reaction and Reform|last=Saunders|first=David|publisher=Longman|year=1992|isbn=0582489784|location=|pages=317-319}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She went to the front during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)]] where she recorded witnessing medical personnel treated badly, the sick cared for inadequately and military authorities engaged in theft and corruption.  Her experiences there served to reinforce her radicalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mothers and Daughters: Women of the Intelligentsia in Nineteenth Century Russia|last=Engel|first=Barbara Alpern|publisher=Northwestern University Press|year=1983|isbn=0810117401|location=Evanston, Illinois|pages=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rozalia, who had not been permitted to graduate in Russia, retrained in Switzerland and supported her family during its time in Geneva by working as a doctor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Scriabin: A Biography of the Russian Composer 1871-1915|last=Faubion|first=Bowers|publisher=Dover|year=1996|isbn=0486288978|location=New York|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; They lived variously in Geneva, Paris and for a time on the Italian Riviera on the advice of Plekhanov's doctors. She accompanied her husband back to Petrograd following the [[February Revolution]] and was with him when he died of tuberculosis in Finland in 1918.  She returned to Paris where she died in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.proza.ru/2016/06/10/583|title=Bograd, Rozaliia Markovna Bograd-Plekhanova|last=Gil'|first=Liubov'|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
[[File:Volkovskoe cemetery Grave of Belinsky Plekhanov Dobrolyubov.jpg|thumb|Graves of Vissarion Belinsky, Georgi Plekhanov, and Nikolay Dobrolyubov in the Volkovskoe cemetery, St Petersburg.]]

Plekhanov left Russia again after the [[October Revolution]] due to his hostility to the Bolsheviks. He died of [[tuberculosis]] in [[Terijoki]], Finland (now a suburb of [[St. Petersburg, Russia]] called [[Zelenogorsk (suburb of Saint Petersburg)|Zelenogorsk]]) on 30 May 1918. He was 61. Plekhanov was buried in the [[Volkovo Cemetery]] in St. Petersburg near the graves of Vissarion Belinsky and [[Nikolay Dobrolyubov]].

It was evident that Plekhanov and Lenin disagreed in terms of commitment to political action, as well as direct guidance to the working class. Despite his disagreements with Lenin, the Soviet Communists cherished his memory and gave his name to the [[Plekhanov Russian Academy of Economics|Soviet Academy of Economics]] and the [[Saint Petersburg Mining Institute|G. V. Plekhanov St. Petersburg State Mining Institute]].

During his life Plekhanov wrote extensively on [[historical materialism]], on the history of materialist philosophy, on the role of the masses and of the individual in history. Plekhanov always insisted that [[Marxism]] was a [[materialism|materialist]] doctrine rather than an [[idealism|idealist]] one, and that Russia would have to pass through a capitalist stage of development before becoming socialist. He also wrote on the relationship between the [[base and superstructure]], on the role of ideologies, and on the role of art in human society. He is remembered as an important and pioneer Marxist thinker on such matters.

'''Holy actions''' are when [[Roman Catholics]] offer their work, [[prayers]], apostolic undertakings, daily works, [[hardships of life]], [[relaxations of body and mind]], and [[family]] and [[marriage]] lives to the [[Lord]], in union with the Holy [[Sacrifice]] of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], in the [[Spirit]] of [[Love]].

==Intentions==
Usually, the spiritual sacrifices are made with intentions in mind, such as "for the intentions of the [[Pope]]" or "for the [[Cooperation|unity]] of Christians". In reality, these offerings can be made for whatever good intentions that Christians bear in [[mind]].

==Purpose==
By their holy actions, Christians share in the priestly [[office]] of [[Jesus Christ]], fulfill the call to [[Sacred|holiness]], [[consecrate]] the [[world]] to [[God]], and hasten the [[Second Coming]] of the Lord.

==Holy actions and the prophetic and kingly offices of Christ==
In light of their share in the priestly office of Christ, Christians also share in the prophetic office and the kingly office of Christ. By their [[holy]] lives, Christians [[evangelize]] in the ordinary circumstances of the world and overcome the [[reign]] of [[sin]] in themselves.

==Holy actions and the Divine Office==
According to [[Sacred Tradition]], Christians unite their offerings to the [[Liturgy of the Hours]], if they do not already pray the Divine Office, because the Liturgy of the Hours is the [[Prayer]] of the [[Catholic Church]], by which the [[night]] and [[day]] are made holy, which is the end of holy actions.

==Example of an offering==
One popular example of an offering is that of the Daily Offering of the [[Apostolate of Prayer]]. While the Offering has gone through many recent changes, for various reasons, it is the traditional Offering that is the most well-known and prayed.

O Jesus,
through the [[Immaculate Heart of Mary]],
I offer you
all my works, prayers, joys,
and sufferings,
in union with the Holy Sacrifice
of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]],
celebrated throughout the world,
for love of you,
for the intentions of
your [[Sacred Heart]],
in [[reparation (legal)|reparation]] for my [[sins]],
for all the intentions of our associations,
and, in particular,
for the intentions of the [[Pope]].
[[Amen]].

'''Hri''' (Sanskrit, also ''hri''; Pali: ''hiri''; Tibetan Wylie: ''ngo tsha shes pa'')  is a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] term translated as "self-respect"  or "conscientiousness". It is defined as the attitude taking earnest care with regard to ones actions and refraining from non-virtuous actions.&lt;ref name=g1&gt;Guenther (1975), Kindle Locations 524-526.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eric1&gt;Kunsang (2004), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the virtuous [[Mental factors (Buddhism)|mental factors]] within the [[Abhidharma]] teachings. 

The [[Abhidharma-samuccaya]] states: 

:What is hri? It is to avoid what is objectionable as far as I see it and its function is to provide a basis for refraining from non-virtuous actions.&lt;ref name="g1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7084">{{Roman Catholicism}}
'''Indifferentism''', in the Roman Catholic faith, is the belief held by some that no one religion or philosophy is superior to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/indifferentism |title=Indifferentism - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Catholic Church]] ascribes indifferentism to many [[atheism|atheistic]], [[materialism|materialistic]], [[pantheism|pantheistic]], and [[agnosticism|agnostic]] philosophies. There are three basic types of indifferentism described by [[Catholic apologetics]]: absolute, restricted, and liberal or latitudinarian indifferentism. Indifferentism was first explicitly identified and opposed by [[Pope Gregory XVI]], in his encyclical ''[[Mirari vos]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Greg16/g16mirar.htm |title=Mirari Vos |publisher=Papalencyclicals.net |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious Indifferentism is to be distinguished from political indifferentism, which is applied to the policy of a state that treats all the religions within its borders as being on an equal footing before the law of the country. Indifferentism is not to be confounded with religious indifference. The former is primarily a theory disparaging the value of religion; the latter term designates the conduct of those who, whether they do or do not believe in the necessity and utility of religion, do in fact neglect to fulfill its duties.

==Catholic teachings on indifferentism==
In the [[Catholic Church]], the belief that one [[religion]] is as good as another, and that all religions are equally valid paths to [[salvation]], is believed to be obviously false, on the grounds that nobody honestly believes that, for instance, a religion based on human sacrifice and the subjugation of rivals is as good, true, and beautiful as one based on heroic love of God and neighbor. The  condemnation of Indifferentism as a heresy is closely linked to the [[dogmatic definition]] that [[Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus|outside the Church there is no salvation]], a complex idea postulating that many people are followers of Christ without any specific understanding that it is in fact Jesus whom they are following. See also the Catholic concept of the [[Baptism of desire|"Baptism of Desire"]]. In support of this stance the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith has said "This does not lessen the sincere respect that the Church has for the various religious traditions, recognizing in them elements of truth and goodness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20021124_politica_en.html#_ftn30 |title=Doctrinal Note on some questions regarding the participation of Catholics in political life |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Absolute indifferentism===
[[Immanuel Kant]] argues that absolute indifferentism represents an extreme form of skepticism that argues that there is no rational ground for accepting any philosophical position,&lt;ref&gt;Rees, D.A. "Kant, Bayle and Indifferentism," ''The Philosophical Review,'' 63(4) {{doi|10.2307/2182293}}&lt;/ref&gt; a position that matches the Roman Catholic understanding of the term. According to the Catholic Church, this type of absolute indifferentism results in a willingness to concede any position.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, J. (1910). Religious Indifferentism. In The Catholic Encyclopedia. New York: Robert Appleton Company. Retrieved December 17, 2010 from New Advent: http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07759a.htm&lt;/ref&gt; It is often associated with [[moral relativism]].

===Restricted indifferentism===
Catholicism also opposes as "indifferentism" a spectrum of pragmatic ideas that admit the necessity of religion because of its positive influence on human life; but which hold that all religions are equally true. The classic advocate of this theory is [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], who maintains, in his ''[[Emile: Or, On Education|Emile]]'', that God looks only to the sincerity of intention, and that everybody can serve Him by remaining in the religion in which they were raised, or by converting to any other that pleases them more (Emile, III). This doctrine is widely advocated today on the grounds that, beyond the truth of God's existence, we can attain to no certain religious knowledge; and that, since God has left us thus in uncertainty, He will be pleased with whatever form of worship we sincerely offer Him. This idea appears to be tenable only in a cultural context that takes most core ethical beliefs for granted: it runs into serious trouble as soon as the basis of ethics comes into question. 

From a Roman Catholic perspective, to say that all these [[argument from inconsistent revelations|irreconcilable beliefs]] are equally pleasing to God is to say that God has no preference for truth and to deny reason. The Roman Catholic Church argues that restricted indifferentism is no different from absolute indifferentism because while nominally acknowledging the utility of religion, to affirm that "all religions are equally good" ultimately means that religion is good for nothing.

===Liberal or latitudinarian indifferentism===
The [[Catholic Church]] also resists as indifferentism the belief that, since [[Christianity]] is the true religion,  it makes no difference which of the several Christian [[religious denomination|denominations]] the believer chooses to join.  Catholicism critiques [[Protestantism]] specifically for this sort of limited indifferentism, noting that many Protestant denominations do not claim any particular fidelity to the gospel, while maintaining that all forms of worship may be equally (read "indifferently") effective for the purpose of building a closer union with God: a [[latitudinarianism|latitudinarian]] position. [[Pope Pius XI]] explicitly criticized the [[Ecumenism|Ecumenical movement]] on these grounds in his encyclical, ''Mortalium animos''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pius XI |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_19280106_mortalium-animos_en.html |title=Pius XI, Mortalium animos (06/01/1928) |publisher=Vatican.va |date=1928-01-06 |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the Catholic perspective, this form of indifferentism is rather like saying, "It makes no difference what tools and materials are used to build a house, it will turn out just fine, no matter what you do or don't do."

Giles published his theory of [[sexual desire]] in ''The Nature of Sexual Desire'' in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;''The Nature of Sexual Desire'', Lanham, MD: University Press of America, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Sexologist]]s usually account for sexual desire either in terms of [[social constructionism]] or as a biological characteristic essential to [[reproduction]]. Giles rejects both these views, and attempts to show by a [[Existential phenomenology|phenomenological]] approach that sexual desire is an [[existential]] [[hierarchy of needs|need]] rooted in the [[human condition]], based on a feeling of incompleteness from the experience of one’s own gender as a form of disequilibrium. The theory thus shows similarities to earlier theories such as those of [[Thomas Nagel]] on [[sexual perversion]], or of [[Aristophanes]] on [[romantic love]] in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]''.&lt;ref name=stewart/&gt;

===Vulnerability and care theory of love===&lt;!-- 'Vulnerability and care theory of love' redirects here --&gt;
The ''vulnerability and care theory of love'' was put forward by Giles in an article entitled "A Theory of Love and Sexual Desire" (1994) and later developed in his book ''The Nature of Sexual Desire'' (2004). Giles' theory has been discussed by scholars [[Dr. Ruth]], in her textbook ''Human Sexuality: a Psychosocial Perspective'' (2002),&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Westheimer and Sanford Lopater, ''Human Sexuality: a Psychosocial Perspective'', New York: Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; and Dr. Barbara Keesling, in her book ''Sexual Pleasure: Reaching New Heights of Sexual Arousal'' (2005).&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Keesling ''Sexual Pleasure: Reaching New Heights of Sexual Arousal'', 2nd edition, Alameda, CA: Hunter House, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naked love theory==
Giles published his "naked love theory" of [[human hairlessness]] in 2010.&lt;ref name=biol&gt;James Giles (2010). "Naked love: The evolution of human hairlessness". ''Biological Theory'' '''5''': 326–336.&lt;/ref&gt; He postulated that hairlessness in humans evolved as a result of the pleasure of skin-to-skin contact between mother and child, and thus ultimately as a consequence of [[bipedalism]]. According to Giles, naked skin is a precondition for the appearance of [[romantic love]].&lt;ref name=naked/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5235">'''John J. O'Meara''' (18 February 1915 – 12 February 2003) was an Irish classical scholar, historian of ancient and medieval philosophy (in particular Augustine and Eriugena), educationalist and writer.

==Biography==
John J. O'Meara was born in [[Eyrecourt]] (Co. Galway) to Mary Donelan and Patrick O'Meara on 18 February 1915, but lost his father when he was less than a year old. He had a younger brother, Patrick ('Paddy'). He was educated at Rockwell College and Garbally, Ballinasloe, becoming for a time a Jesuit seminarist.
In his autobiographical book, ''The Singing Masters'', O'Meara describes the hard times of his childhood, including the terror brought by the British [[Black and Tans]], and by the subsequent [[Irish Civil War]]. He also describes his early experience of the beauty of nature, and of the difficult experience of following and at last ending his engagement as a Jesuit novice.
A collection of short stories, ''Remembering'' ''Eyrecourt. Vignettes and Tales of earlier Days,'' Eyrecourt 2003, also describes the world of his childhood.

O'Meara took an M.A. degree in classics at [[University College Dublin]] in 1939 and was awarded a scholarship allowing him to complete a Doctorate in Philosophy at the [[University of Oxford]] (1942–45). ''The Singing Masters'' also describes war-time Oxford and the antiquated (and quaint) conditions in which he studied there. His thesis concerned Augustine's use of Porphyry and was later revised and published in Paris (1959).
Returning to Dublin he was appointed Professor of Latin at University College Dublin in 1948, where he remained until his retirement in 1984.
O'Meara held visiting appointments at the Princeton [[Institute for Advanced Study|Institute of Advanced Study]], Dumbarton Oaks ([[Harvard University]]) and [[Vassar College]].
In Ireland he played a major role in the effort to modernize education in the schools and universities, in particular the teaching of Latin and Irish, and the collaboration between University College Dublin and [[Trinity College Dublin]]. His ideas were ahead of their time in the conservative and Church-dominated atmosphere in Ireland.

O'Meara contributed to the founding of the Irish Association of Classical Teachers in 1959. In 1954 he published ''The Young Augustine'' (with many re-editions), an introduction to reading Augustine's ''Confessions'' which has kept its value.
As well as being a leading internationally recognized scholar on Augustine, he did much to further the study of the early medieval Irish philosopher [[John Scotus Eriugena]], founding the Society for the Promotion of Eriugenian Studies in 1970 which stimulated a spectacular development in the study of Eriugena. He published a monograph on the philosopher, ''Eriugena'' (1988), and when he died he was working on finishing a complete edition and English translation of Eriugena's masterpiece, the ''Periphyseon''.
O'Meara also published English translations of Latin texts important to Ireland, [[Giraldus Cambrensis]]' ''Topography of Ireland'' and ''The Voyage of Saint Brendan''.
O'Meara was president of the Alliance Française in Ireland and was awarded the [[Légion d'Honneur]].
He was a member of the [[Royal Irish Academy]] and of other international scholarly associations.
In 1947 O'Meara married Odile de Barthes de Montfort, with whom he had three children and with whom he published a little book presenting new discoveries concerning Bernadette of Lourdes ''(Ordeal at Lourdes'').

'''John Millar of Glasgow''' (22 June 1735 – 30 May 1801) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[philosopher]], [[historian]] and [[Regius Professor]] of Civil Law at the [[University of Glasgow]] from 1761 to 1800.

==Biography==
Born a son of the manse of the Kirk o’ Shotts, [[Shotts]], [[Lanarkshire]], John Millar was educated by an uncle and then on his father being transferred to the parish of Hamilton, at the Old Grammar School of Hamilton (renamed the [[Hamilton Academy]] in 1848.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/John_Millar.aspx International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences 1968 Millar, John] Retrieved 2011-05-04&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gashe.ac.uk:443/public_docs/isaar/P0309.html Gateway to the Archive of Scottish Higher Education Biography, John Millar] Retrieved 2011-05-04&lt;/ref&gt; Continuing his studies at the [[University of Glasgow]], he became one of the most important followers of [[Adam Smith]], the founder of [[economic]] science. For a short time in the 1750s he was tutor in the household of [[Henry Home, Lord Kames]]. In 1760 he was admitted to the [[Faculty of Advocates]].&lt;ref name=CHECP&gt;{{Citation | last=Haakonssen | first=Knud | year=2006 | contribution=Millar, John | editor-last=Haakonssen | editor-first=Knud | title=The Cambridge History of Eighteenth-Century Philosophy | publisher=Cambridge University Press | volume=2 | pages=1205}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1761 to 1800, Millar was [[Regius Professor]] of [[civil law (legal system)|Civil Law]] at Glasgow, where his lectures gained him nationwide fame. His colleagues and supporters included Smith, Kames, and [[David Hume]]. Millar was elected Clerk of the Senate of the University of Glasgow in 1772.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/biography/?id=WH0017&amp;type=P University of Glasgow. Biography, John Millar] Retrieved 201-05-03&lt;/ref&gt;

Millar's ''Origin of the Distinction of Ranks'', published in 1778, advanced the view that [[economic system]] determines all [[social relations]], even those between the [[gender]]s. Such a view later became known as [[economic determinism]], and was an important influence on [[Marxism]]. [[Werner Sombart]] described Millar's book as "one of the best and most complete sociologies that we possess".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Strasser|first=Hermann|title=The Normative Structure of Sociology|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_DNHBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT65&amp;ots=qGmm3-nSib&amp;dq=Sombart%20Millar%20Distinction%20of%20Rank&amp;pg=PT65#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317652311|chapter=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lehmann|first=W. C.|year=1952|journal=British Journal of Sociology|title=John Millar, Historical Sociologist: Some Remarkable Anticipations of Modern Sociology |volume=3|issue=1|page=31|jstor=587525}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His ''Historical View of the English Government'', published from 1787, was an important contemporary [[histories of England|history of England]], representing a milestone in the development of [[historiography]]. Millar engaged with other historians, drawing comparisons with the works and emphasised the social and economic bases of political system, which strongly differentiated his work from most of the earlier ones, which were more speculative than scientific.

==Family==
Millar lost a daughter by consumption in 1791, and his wife in 1795. His eldest son, John, a promising young man, went to the bar, and married the daughter of Dr. Cullen. He published a book upon the "Law relating to Insurances" in 1787. Ill-health and the unpopularity of the Whiggism which he inherited from his father induced him to emigrate in the spring of 1795 to America, where he died soon afterwards from a sunstroke.{{sfn|Stephen|1894|p=203}}

Three sons and six daughters survived their father. Of these James became professor of mathematics at Glasgow; the second, [[William Millar (British Army officer)|William]] joined the Royal Artillery; the third was a writer to the signet. One daughter, Agnes was married to [[James Mylne]], professor of moral philosophy at Glasgow, and another, Margaret, to Dr. John Thomson, by whom she was mother of Allan Thomson, professor of surgery at Edinburgh. He left his manuscripts to his eldest son, to Professor Mylne, and to John Craig, his nephew, by whom some were published in 1803.{{sfn|Stephen|1894|p=203}}&lt;ref&gt;http://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/biography/?id=WH1192&amp;type=P&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memorials==
In 1985 the John Millar Chair of Law at the University of Glasgow was established in his memory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/chair-and-lectureship/?id=67 University of Glasgow. The John Millar Chair of  Law] Retrieved 2011-05-04&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding==
Founded in 1793 as a "conversation club" by the [[William Turner (Unitarian minister)|Reverend William Turner]] and others – more than fifty years before the [[London Library]] – the annual subscription was originally one [[Guinea (British coin)|guinea]]. The Lit and Phil library contained works in French, Spanish, German and Latin; its contacts were international, and its members debated a wide range of issues, but religion and politics were prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.litandphil.org.uk/html_pages/LP_history.html Lit &amp; Phil History – Independent Library Newcastle&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114230048/http://www.litandphil.org.uk/html_pages/LP_history.html |date=2007-11-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Women were first admitted to the library in 1804.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Editorial |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/sep/25/newcastle-lit-and-phil |title=In praise of… Newcastle's Lit &amp; Phil &amp;#124; Opinion |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2017-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In February 2011, actor and comedian [[Alexander Armstrong (comedian)|Alexander Armstrong]] became President of the Lit &amp; Phil. He launched their funding appeal at a special gala event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Interview: Alexander Armstrong, president of the Lit &amp; Phil|url=http://www.journallive.co.uk/culture-newcastle/arts-news/2011/12/15/interview-alexander-armstrong-president-of-the-lit-phil-61634-29956824/#ixzz2CkReETDb|publisher=[[The Journal (newspaper)|The Journal]]|date=15 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At the start of 2012, membership of the Library reached 2,000, the highest number since 1952.

==History==
[[File:Literary And Philiosophical Society Of Newcastle.jpg|thumb|Library interior]]
During the 19th and 20th centuries, the Lit &amp; Phil was host to a long list of the intelligentsia of the era. Engineer and inventor [[George Stephenson]] showed his miner's lamp there, and in 1879, when [[Joseph Swan]] demonstrated his electric light bulbs, the Lit and Phil building became the first public building to be so illuminated.

The Society received in 1800 the country's first specimens of the [[wombat]] and the [[Platypus|duck-billed platypus]] from [[John Hunter (New South Wales)|John Hunter]], Governor of New South Wales and honorary member of the Lit and Phil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.sl.nsw.gov.au/banks/series_38/38_11.cfm Series 38.11 Copy of a letter received by the Literary and Philosophical Society... 5 August 1798&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Page 270 of Magazine of Natural History, edited by John Claudius Loudon, Edward Charlesworth, John Denson, published 1829 by Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, and Green. ([https://books.google.com/books?id=MFVIAAAAMAAJ Google's version])&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1822 and 1825, a new building was created for the Society on Westgate Road, designed by [[John and local architect Benjamin Green|John Green]]. The building is still in use today, with many original features including iron-work second-floor galleries.

An animal with the [[conservation status]] of '''lower risk''' is one with populations levels high enough to ensure its survival. Animals with this status do not qualify as being threatened or extinct, however, natural disasters or certain human activities would cause them to change to either of these classifications.

This classification is sub-divided into three types:
*[[Conservation dependent]] - where cessation of current conservation measures could result in it being classified at a higher risk level.
*[[Near threatened]] - close to becoming [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]] but not meeting the criteria.
*[[Least concern]] - where neither of the two above apply.

'''Luigi Taparelli''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Society of Jesus|SJ]]}} (born '''Prospero Taparelli d'Azeglio'''; 1793–1862) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] scholar of the [[Society of Jesus]]  who coined the term [[social justice]].&lt;ref&gt;https://scholarworks.wmich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1150&amp;context=ojot&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Taparelli cofounded the journal ''[[Civiltà Cattolica]]'' in 1850 and wrote for it for twelve years. He was particularly concerned with the problems arising from the [[industrial revolution]]. He was a proponent of reviving the philosophical school of [[Thomism]], and his social teachings influenced [[Pope Leo XIII]]'s 1891 [[encyclical]], ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' (On the Condition of the Working Classes).

In 1825, he became convinced that the philosophy of [[Thomas Aquinas]] needed to be revived, thinking that the [[subjectivism|subjective]] philosophy of [[René Descartes]] leads to dramatic errors in morality and politics. He reasoned that whereas different opinions on the natural sciences have no effect on nature, unclear [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] ideas about humanity and society can lead to social chaos.

The [[Catholic Church]] had not yet developed a clear philosophical view regarding the great social changes that were appearing in the early nineteenth century in [[Europe]], which led to much confusion among the ecclesiastical hierarchy and laity. In response to this problem, Taparelli applied the methods of [[Thomism]] to these social problems in a coherent manner. 

After the social revolutions of 1848, the church decided to enter the conflict raging between the ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[liberal capitalism|liberal capitalists]] and the [[socialism|socialists]]. Up until then, the church relied primarily on evangelical charitable activities. In 1850, Taparelli was granted permission by [[Pope Pius IX]] to co-found ''Civiltà Cattolica'' with [[Carlo Maria Curci]]. In particular, he attacked the tendency to separate morality from [[positive law]], and also the "heterodox spirit" of unconstrained freedom of conscience which destroyed the unity of society.

His major ideas include [[sociality]] and [[subsidiarity]]. He viewed society as not a monolithic group of individuals, but of various levels of sub-societies, with individuals being members of these. Each level of society has both rights and duties which should be recognized and supported. All levels of society should cooperate rationally and not resort to competition and conflict.

His brother was the Italian politician [[Massimo d'Azeglio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Aloysius Taparelli}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century it was home to [[Robert Warren (Irish politician)|Robert Warren]] and [[Arthur Guinness, 1st Baron Ardilaun|Arthur Guinness]] and is a protected structure in Dublin.&lt;ref name=dublin/&gt;&lt;ref name=hist&gt;[http://www.manresa.ie/chapel/history History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130924222719/http://manresa.ie/chapel/history |date=2013-09-24 }} from Manresa.ie, retrieved 22 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Origins===
Manresa House is a stately home that has had a series of different owners. It was originally known as Granby Hall, and then Baymount Castle and included 17 acres of land surrounding the house. Until 1783, it was a residence of the [[Bishop of Down and Connor]], James Traill. In 1838, it was renovated by [[Robert Warren (Irish politician)|Robert Warren]]. Soon after, it became the property of the [[Sisters of Loreto]] who used it as a school. In 1851, it was renovated by the sisters, because the building was damaged by a serious fire that year.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;

In 1898, they sold it to [[Arthur Guinness, 1st Baron Ardilaun]] and moved to [[Balbriggan]].

===Use as a Preparatory School===
In around 1904 William Scott opened a school on the premises called Baymount Preparatory School, of which he was headmaster until 1936. The school was then acquired by [[John Tudor Gwynn]], who ran it until 1948. John T Gwynn was a descendant of [[John Gwynn (professor)|John Gwynn]] and a member of the Gwynn family that included noted literary figures such as [[Stephen Gwynn]] and [[Edward Gwynn]].&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;

===Establishment of Spirituality Centre===
In 1948, the [[Archbishop of Dublin (Roman Catholic)|Archbishop of Dublin]], [[John Charles McQuaid]] asked the Jesuits to establish a spirituality centre in the [[Dollymount]] area, so they bought Baymount Castle. They renamed it Manresa House after [[Manresa]] in [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]], where [[St Ignatius of Loyola]], the founder of the Jesuits had many spiritual experiences that contributed to formulation of his [[Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola|Spiritual Exercises]].&lt;ref name=jes&gt;[http://www.jesuit.ie/where-we-work/manresa-spirituality-centre Manresa Spirituality Centre] from Jesuit.ie, retrieved 22 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Retreat Centre==
The first retreat was held there in 1949. In 1966, a new separate house to was built to accommodate more retreatants and was opened in 1967. In 1969, the Irish Jesuits moved their [[novitiate]] from [[Emo Court]] in [[County Laois]] to a building within the grounds of Manresa House. In 1977, part of the property, near the novitiate, was sold to developers to build a housing estate. In 1991, the novitiate moved to Dublin. In 2006, a new building was built on the site of the old novitiate for the [[Tertianship]] of the Jesuits in Europe.&lt;ref name=jes/&gt;

==Interior==
The centre offers a variety of directed retreats, seminars, and various day and evening events, as well as the 30-day retreat, from the [[Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola|Spiritual Exercises]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sj-wanderings.org/dublin/manresa/retreat-house/ Manresa Retreat House] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130624222747/http://www.sj-wanderings.org/dublin/manresa/retreat-house/ |date=2013-06-24 }} from Sabbatical Wanderings, retrieved 22 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In the oval meditation room are a set of windows designed by [[Evie Hone]]. They were installed in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://multitext.ucc.ie/d/Evie_Hone_window_in_the_Jesuit_Manresa_House_in_Dublin Evie Hone window in the Jesuit Manresa House in Dublin]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} from [[University College Cork]] retrieved 22 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4456">'''Marcus Manuel Hartog''' (1851 – 21 January 1924) was an English educator, natural historian, [[philosopher of biology]] and [[Zoology|zoologist]] in [[Cork (city)|Cork, Ireland]]. He contributed to multiple volumes of the ''Cambridge Natural History''.

==Life==
Hartog was born in 1851,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?r=17186201&amp;d=bmd_1225799362 FreeBMD birth Births Sep 1851 Hartog Marcus Manuel Whitechapel II 618]&lt;/ref&gt; the second son&lt;ref&gt;England 1861 census Class: RG9; Piece: 136; Folio: 2; Page: 2; GSU roll: 542579.&lt;/ref&gt; of the Professor Alphonse Hartog (died 1904) and Marion (née Moss, 1821–1907), younger brother of [[Numa Edward Hartog]] and elder brother of Sir [[Philip Joseph Hartog]], Academic Registrar of London University and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Dacca.

Hartog was educated at the [[North London Collegiate School]], University College, London, and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he took a first class in the National Science Tripos in 1874, and went out in the same year to Ceylon as assistant to the Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens — a post that he held for three years. On his return he became a demonstrator, and afterwards a lecturer in natural history at Owens College, Manchester. In 1882 he began an association of more than 40 years with the educational life of Cork. For 27 years he was Professor of Natural History at [[University College, Cork|Queen's College, Cork]] (1882–1907), and in 1909 proceeded to the chair of Zoology in what had become University College. When in 1921 he vacated the appointment, he was made Emeritus Professor.

Hartog was a [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]]. He argued for the inheritance of acquired characteristics and identified as a [[Vitalism|vitalist]]. He supported the [[Non-Darwinian evolution|non-Darwinian]] evolutionary ideas of [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]] and wrote a supportive introduction to his book ''Unconscious Memory''.&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous. (1913). ''Review: Vitalism And Reproduction. Reviewed Work: Problems Of Life And Reproduction by Marcus Hartog''.

Hartog died in [[Paris]] on 21 January 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = [[s:The_Times/1924/Obituary/Marcus Hartog|Death Of Professor Marcus Hartog]] (transcription) | newspaper = [[The Times]] | location = London | page = 7 | date = 28 January 1924| issue=43560 | archiveurl = | archivedate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selected publications==
Hartog contributed articles to the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' and the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', as well as writing many articles for scientific journals.

'''Maria Gaetana Agnesi''' ({{IPA-it|maˈriːa ɡaeˈtaːna aɲˈɲeːzi; -ɛːzi}};&lt;ref&gt;Canepari, L. (1999, 2009) ''[http://venus.unive.it/canipa/pdf/DiPI_3_A-Z.pdf Dizionario di pronuncia italiana] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515190043/http://venus.unive.it/canipa/pdf/DiPI_3_A-Z.pdf |date=15 May 2013 }}''. Bologna, Zanichelli.&lt;/ref&gt; 16 May  1718 – 9 January 1799) was an [[Italians|Italian]] [[mathematician]], [[philosopher]], [[Theology|theologian]], and [[humanitarianism|humanitarian]]. She was the first woman to write a mathematics handbook and the first woman appointed as a mathematics professor at a university.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150404070154/http://womenshistory.about.com/od/sciencemath1/a/maria_agnesi.htm WOMEN'S HISTORY CATEGORIES ([[Wayback Machine|archived]] from the original)], About Education&lt;/ref&gt;

She is credited with writing the first book discussing both [[Differential calculus|differential]] and [[integral calculus]] and was a member of the faculty at the [[University of Bologna]], although she never served.

She devoted the last four decades of her life to studying [[theology]] (especially [[patristics]]) and to [[charitable work]] and serving the poor. She was a devout [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] and wrote extensively on the marriage between intellectual pursuit and mystical contemplation, most notably in her essay ''Il cielo mistico'' (The Mystic Heaven). She saw the rational contemplation of God as a complement to prayer and contemplation of the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Mazzotti, Massimo.

Isis, Vol. 92, No. 4 (Dec. 2001), 657-683). http://history.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/Maria%20Gaetana%20Agnesi.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maria Teresa Agnesi Pinottini]], [[clavicembalo|clavicembalist]] and [[composer]], was her sister.

==Early life==
Maria Gaetana Agnesi was born in [[Milan]], to a wealthy and literate family.{{sfn|A'Becket|1913}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agnesscott.edu/Lriddle/WOMEN/agnesi.htm |title=Maria Gaetana Agnesi |publisher=Agnesscott.edu |date= |accessdate=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=moar&gt;{{cite book|last=Maor|first=Eli|title=Trigonometric Delights|date=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9780691158204|pages=108–111|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iShKAIKrCSoC&amp;lpg=PA108&amp;ots=eAotfYEnKO&amp;dq=%22Maria%20Agnesi%20and%20Her%20%E2%80%9CWitch%E2%80%9D%22&amp;pg=PA108#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Maria%20Agnesi%20and%20Her%20%E2%80%9CWitch%E2%80%9D%22&amp;f=false|chapter=Maria Agnesi and Her “Witch”}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father Pietro Agnesi, a wealthy silk merchant,&lt;ref name=findlen&gt;Findlen, Paula, ''Calculations of faith: mathematics, philosophy, and sanctity in 18th-century Italy (new work on Maria Gaetana Agnesi)'' ''Historia Mathematica'' 38 (2011), 248-291. {{doi|10.1016/j.hm.2010.05.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; wanted to elevate his family into the Milanese nobility. In order to achieve his goal, he had married [[Anna Fortunato Brivio]] of the [[Brivius de Brokles]] family in 1717.  Her mother's death provided her the excuse to retire from public life. She took over management of the household. She was one of 21 children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Salem Press Biographical Encyclopedia,|last=Spradley|first=Joseph|publisher=Salem Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=Ebsco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Il diploma di nomina dell' Agnesi all' Università di Bologna.png|thumb|Agnesi's diploma from Università di Bologna]]
Maria was recognized early on as a [[child prodigy]]; she could speak both [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[French language|French]] at five years of age. By her eleventh birthday, she had also learned [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Hebrew]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[German language|German]], and [[Latin]], and was referred to as the "Seven-Tongued Orator".&lt;ref name="Ogilvie"&gt;{{cite book|title=Women in science: antiquity through the nineteenth century : a biographical dictionary with annotated bibliography|last=Ogilvie|first=Marilyn Bailey|publisher=MIT Press|year=1986|isbn=0-262-15031-X|edition=3rd print|location=Cambridge, Mass.|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agnesi suffered a mysterious illness at the age of twelve that was attributed to her excessive studying and was prescribed vigorous dancing and horseback riding. This treatment did not work; she began to experience extreme convulsions, after which she was encouraged to pursue moderation. By age fourteen, she was studying [[ballistics]] and [[geometry]].&lt;ref name=Ogilvie /&gt; When she was fifteen, her father began to regularly gather in his house a circle of the most learned men in [[Bologna]], before whom she read and maintained a series of theses on the most abstruse philosophical questions. Records of these meetings are given in [[Charles de Brosses]]' ''Lettres sur l'Italie'' and in the ''Propositiones Philosophicae'', which her father had published in 1738 as an account of her final performance, where she defended 190 philosophical theses.&lt;ref name=Ogilvie/&gt;

Her father remarried twice after Maria's mother died, and Maria Agnesi ended up the eldest of 21 children, including her half-siblings. Her father agreed with her that if she were to continue her research into mathematics, then she would be permitted to do all the charity work she wanted&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Headstrong 52 Women Who Changed Science-and the World|last=Swaby|first=Rachel|publisher=Broadway Books|year=2015|isbn=|location=New York|pages=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;In addition to her performances and lessons, her responsibility was to teach her siblings. This task kept her from her own goal of entering a convent, as she had become strongly religious. Although her father refused to grant this wish, he agreed to let her live from that time on in an almost conventual semi-retirement, avoiding all interactions with society and devoting herself entirely to the study of mathematics.&lt;ref name=Ogilvie/&gt; After having read in 1739 the ''Traité analitique des sections coniques'' of the Marquis [[Guillaume de l'Hôpital]], she was fully introduced into the field in 1740 by [[Ramiro Rampinelli]], an [[Olivetan]] monk who was one of the most notable Italian mathematicians of that time.&lt;ref name=gl/&gt; During that time, Maria studied with him both [[differential calculus|differential]] and [[integral]] calculus. Her family was recognized as one of the wealthiest in Milan.

==Contributions to mathematics==
===''Instituzioni analitiche''===
[[File:Il frontispizio delle Instituzioni analitiche dell' Agnesi.png|thumb|right|First page of ''Instituzioni analitiche'' (1748)]]
According to  Britannica, she is "considered to be the first woman in the Western world to have achieved a reputation in mathematics." The most valuable result of her labours was the ''Instituzioni analitiche ad uso della gioventù italiana'', (Analytical Institutions for the Use of Italian Youth) which was published in Milan in 1748 and "was regarded as the best introduction extant to the works of [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]]."{{sfn|A'Becket|1913}} The goal of this work was, according to Agnesi herself, to give a systematic illustration of the different results and theorems of [[infinitesimal calculus]].&lt;ref name=gl/&gt; The model for her treatise was ''Le calcul différentiel et intégral dans l’Analyse'' by [[Charles René Reyneau]].&lt;ref name=gl/&gt; In this treatise, she worked on integrating [[mathematical analysis]] with [[algebra]].&lt;ref name=Ogilvie/&gt; The first volume treats of the analysis of [[Finite difference method|finite quantities]] and the second of the analysis of [[infinitesimal]]s. 

A French translation of the second volume by [[P. T. d'Antelmy]], with additions by [[Charles Bossut]] (1730–1814), was published in [[Paris]] in 1775; and ''Analytical Institutions'', an English translation of the whole work by [[John Colson]] (1680–1760), the [[Lucasian Professor of Mathematics]] at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], "inspected" by [[John Hellins]], was published in 1801 at the expense of [[Francis Maseres|Baron Maseres]].&lt;ref&gt;''Analytical institutions...'' (four volumes), London, 1801 {{google books|o54AAAAAMAAJ|vol. 1|page=PR3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was dedicated to Empress [[Maria Theresa]], who thanked Agnesi with the gift of a diamond ring, a personal letter, and a diamond and crystal case. Many others praised her work, including [[Pope Benedict XIV]], who wrote her a complimentary letter and sent her a gold wreath and a gold medal.&lt;ref name=Ogilvie/&gt; 

In writing this work, Agnesi was advised and helped by two distinguished mathematicians: her former teacher Ramiro Rampinelli and [[Jacopo Riccati]].&lt;ref name=gl&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gliozzi|first1=Mario|title=Agnesi, Maria Gaetana|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/maria-gaetana-agnesi_(Dizionario_Biografico)/|website=Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani|publisher=Enciclopedia Italiana|accessdate=17 September 2015|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Witch of Agnesi====
{{Main|Witch of Agnesi}}

The ''Instituzioni analitiche...'', among other things, discussed a curve earlier studied and constructed by [[Pierre de Fermat]] and [[Guido Grandi]]. Grandi called the curve ''versoria'' in Latin and suggested the term ''versiera'' for Italian,&lt;ref name=truesdell&gt;C. Truesdell, "Correction and Additions for 'Maria Gaetana Agnesi'", ''Archive for History of Exact Science'' 43 (1991), 385–386. {{doi|10.1007/BF00374764}}
*Per Grandi: "...nata da' seni versi, che da me suole chiamarsi la ''Versiera'' in latino pero ''Versoria''..."&lt;/ref&gt;  possibly as a pun:&lt;ref&gt;S.M.Stigler, "Cauchy and the witch of Agnesi: An historical note on the Cauchy distribution", ''[[Biometrika]]'', 1974, vol. 61, no.2 p. 375–380&lt;/ref&gt;  '[[wikt:versoria|versoria]]' is a nautical term, "[[sheet (sailing)|sheet]]", while ''versiera/aversiera'' is "she-devil", "witch", from Latin ''Adversarius'', an alias for "[[devil]]" (Adversary of God). For whatever reasons, after translations and publications of the ''Instituzioni analitiche...'' the curve has become known as the "Witch of Agnesi".{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Agnesi also wrote a commentary on the ''Traité analytique des sections coniques du [[Guillaume de l'Hôpital|marquis de l'Hôpital]]'' which, though highly praised by those who saw it in manuscript, was never published.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, 1911, p. 378&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
In 1750, on the illness of her father, she was appointed by [[Pope Benedict XIV]]{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} to the chair of mathematics and [[natural philosophy]] and physics at [[Bologna]], though she never served.&lt;ref name=Ogilvie/&gt; She was the second woman ever to be granted professorship at a university, [[Laura Bassi]] being the first.&lt;ref&gt;Pickover, Clifford. ''The Math Book''. Sterling Publishing, 2009, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1751, she became ill again and was told not to study by her doctors. After the death of her father in 1752 she carried out a long-cherished purpose by giving herself to the study of [[theology]], and especially of the [[Fathers of the Church|Fathers]] and devoted herself to the poor, homeless, and sick, giving away the gifts she had received and begging for money to continue her work with the poor. In 1783, she founded and became the director of the [[Opera Pia Trivulzio]], a home for Milan's elderly, where she lived as the nuns of the institution did.&lt;ref name=Ogilvie/&gt; On 9 January 1799, Maria Agnesi died poor and was buried in a mass grave for the poor with fifteen other bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.math.twsu.edu/history/Women/agnesi.html|title=Agnesi|website=www.math.twsu.edu|access-date=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
In 1996, an asteroid, [[16765 Agnesi]], was named after Agnesi. There is a [[Agnesi (crater)|crater]] on [[Venus]] named after her, too.&lt;ref&gt;''Atlas of Venus'', by Peter John Cattermole, Patrick Moore, 1997, {{ISBN|0-521-49652-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=R3hsaELH9bUC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;dq=agnesi+crater+venus&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=a53CTu_iMcmciALW3ojUCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 112]&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a mathematical curve named the [[Witch of Agnesi]].

In 2017, [[Francis Ford Coppola Presents|the Family Coppola]] released a [[brandy]] named after Agnesi.&lt;ref name="Stierch"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stierch|first1=Sarah|title=Coppola Family Launches Spirits Line Named After Historic Women|url=http://www.sonomamag.com/coppola-family-launches-spirits-line/|website=Sonoma Magazine|accessdate=27 September 2017|date=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marianna Marchesa Florenzi''' (1802 - 15 April 1870, [[Florence]]), née '''Marianna  Bacinetti''', was an Italian noblewoman and translator of philosophical works. She was also known by her married name of '''Marianna Florenzi Waddington'''.

==Life==
A daughter of count Bacinetti of [[Ravenna]], she had a literary education and devoted herself to reading philosophical works, becoming the female ideal of an educated woman of the time and a witty hostess of cultural gatherings and [[salon (gathering)|salon]]s. She was one of the first female students, studying natural sciences at the [[University of Perugia]] in the first half of the 19th century. She translated [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]'s ''[[Monadology]]'' into Italian and also promoted the spread of works by [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]] in Italian. Politically she supported [[Risorgimento|Italy's national-movement]] and in 1850 published ''Some reflections on socialism and communism'', which (like many of her other works) ended up on the church's [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]].  She was for forty years a lover and close friend of [[Ludwig I, King of Bavaria|Ludwig I of Bavaria]], whom she visited more than thirty times. He always sought her advice, even in government matters, and 3,000 of her letters to him (along with 1,500 of his replies) survive.

'''Morris Janowitz''' (October 22, 1919 – November 7, 1988) was an American [[sociologist]] and professor who made major contributions to sociological theory, the study of [[prejudice]], urban issues, and [[patriotism]]. He was one of the founders of [[military sociology]] and made major contributions, along with [[Samuel P. Huntington]], to the establishment of contemporary [[civil-military relations]]. He was a professor of sociology at the [[University of Michigan]] and the [[University of Chicago]] and held a five-year chairmanship of the Sociology Department at University of Chicago. He was the Lawrence A. Kimpton Distinguished Service Professor at the University of Chicago.&lt;ref name=Folwer&gt;Fowler, Glenn.(1988) [https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/08/obituaries/prof-morris-janowitz-dead-at-69-specialized-on-military-in-society.html Prof. Morris Janowitz dead at 69; specialized on military in society]," ''The New York Times,'' Nov.8.&lt;/ref&gt; Janowitz was the vice-president of the [[American Sociological Association]], receiving their Career of Distinguished Scholarship award, and a fellow of both the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] and the [[American Philosophical Association]].&lt;ref name=IUSJanowitz&gt;http://www.iusafs.org/JanowitzBio.asp - website accessed 6/22/11&lt;/ref&gt; Janowitz also founded the [[Inter-University Seminar on Armed Forces and Society]], as well as the journal ''[[Armed Forces &amp; Society]]''. He was an early founder of the field of [[military sociology]]. His students, such as [[David R. Segal]], Mady Segal, and [[James Burk]] are prominent and influential military sociologists. 

==Early life and education ==
Janowitz was born in Paterson, New Jersey, the second son of Polish-Jewish immigrants. Paterson was known for its silk industry, in which his father worked, eventually establishing his own silk business. Janowitz earned a bachelor's degree in economics from Washington Square College of New York University ([[New York University]]), where he studied under [[Sidney Hook]] (former student of [[John Dewey]]) and [[Bruce Lannes Smith]] (former student of [[Harold Lasswell]]). Hook exposed Janowitz to Dewey's philosophy of American [[pragmatism]], while Smith exposed him to Laswell's "[[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago School]]" approach to social science and psychoanalysis.&lt;ref name=Introduction:PragmaticSociology&gt;Burk, James.(1991) "Introduction: A Pragmatic Sociology," in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=CPtHVs033MwC&amp;pg=PR4 On Social Organization and Social Control]'' by Morris Janowitz. University of Chicago Press, Chicago. p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career and military service ==
After graduating from Washington Square College, he worked for the Library of Congress and the Justice Department Special War Policies Unit. In 1943, Janowitz was drafted into the Army, where he joined the [[Office of Strategic Services]] Research and Analysis Branch, performing content analysis of communications and propaganda in German radio broadcasts, as well as interviews of German prisoners of war. Janowitz's experiences with the war had a profound impact on the subsequent direction of his academic career: "This experience with war, with the research that war required of him and with other social scientists engaged in the war effort, crystallized Janowitz's self-identification as a social scientist".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=Introduction|authorlink=James Burk|p=7|title=On Social Organization and Social Control|issn=0073-1986|first=James|last=Burk|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|year=1991|isbn=9780226393032|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CPtHVs033MwC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later career ==
In 1946, Janowitz began his graduate studies at the University of Chicago. Before completing his Ph.D in Sociology in 1948, he was hired as an instructor at Chicago. He became an assistant professor upon completion of his PhD. In 1951, Janowitz became a sociology professor at the [[University of Michigan]], where he taught until 1961. Toward the end of his stay at Michigan, Janowitz took an academic fellowship, during which he completed his first major publication, ''The Professional Soldier.'' During his last year at Michigan, Janowitz organized a group of scholars around the founding of the [[Inter-University Seminar on Armed Forces and Society]] (IUS) to "support development of sociological analyses of military organization; to prepare a series of specific research papers on internal military organization; and to serve as a focal point for long-term training in and for the development of a relationship between sociology and the military establishment". The IUS remains active to date, and continues to publish the journal [[Armed Forces &amp; Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Segal|first1=David R.|title=Profile: Morris Janowitz|journal=The Military Psychologist|date=Fall 2017|volume=32|issue=3|pages=20-25|url=http://www.apadivisions.org/division-19/publications/newsletters/military/2017/12/issue.pdf|accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, Janowitz left Michigan and became a professor in the University of Chicago Sociology Department. In 1967, Janowitz was appointed chairman of the department. In this capacity, he worked to rebuild what seemed to be a once great, but presently fractured, Sociology Department. Janowitz did so by encouraging "new theoretical outlooks and alternative methodological approaches" through hiring more diverse faculty members from different disciplines. He also sought to reconstruct the intellectual heritage of the department through the creation of "The Heritage of Sociology" book series. The compilation of 40 volumes in the Heritage series led Janowitz to reflect upon the philosophical foundations for sociology, recalling influential pragmatists such as [[George Herbert Mead]], [[Sydney Hook]], and perhaps most importantly, [[John Dewey]]. Janowitz completed his five-year chairmanship of the Sociology Department in 1972. In 1972, Janowitz was honored as a [[Pitt Professor of American History and Institutions]] by the University of Cambridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Segal|first1=David R.|title=Profile: Morris Janowitz|journal=The Military Psychologist|date=Fall 2017|volume=32|issue=3|pages=20-25|url=http://www.apadivisions.org/division-19/publications/newsletters/military/2017/12/issue.pdf|accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Janowitz remained in the department until his retirement in 1987, focusing more heavily on his academic pursuits, which culminated into a trilogy of books published between 1976 and 1983: ''Social Control of the Welfare State,'' ''The Last Half-Century,'' and ''The Reconstruction of Patriotism.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Segal|first1=David R.|title=Profile: Morris Janowitz|journal=The Military Psychologist|date=Fall 2017|volume=32|issue=3|pages=20-25|url=http://www.apadivisions.org/division-19/publications/newsletters/military/2017/12/issue.pdf|accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death ==
Janowitz died one year after retirement in 1988 on November 7 from [[Parkinson's]] disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fowler|first1=Glenn|title=Prof. Morris Janowitz Dead at 69; Specialized on Military in Society|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/08/obituaries/prof-morris-janowitz-dead-at-69-specialized-on-military-in-society.html|accessdate=18 January 2018|agency=New York Times|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideas and Accomplishments==
In 1953 Janowitz summoned a group of scholars, including [[Samuel P. Huntington]], to Ann Arbor, Michigan to discuss the future study of the armed forces. This led Janowitz to cultivate and develop his ideas about military sociology through a Fulbright Fellowship in 1954 and a fellowship at the Center of Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences in 1958, where in 1960 he completed his first major publication on military sociology, ''The Professional Soldier: A Social and Political Portrait'' (13).&lt;ref name=Introduction:PragmaticSociology/&gt;

''The Professional Soldier'' was a major accomplishment and established the study of the military as a sub-field in sociology by creating a "fertile research agenda" which other scholars could and still do follow.&lt;ref name=IUSJanowitz/&gt; It remains one of the foundational works in the area of [[civil-military relations]],&lt;ref name=EB1989YB&gt;{{Citation

and was particularly important given that previous foci of sociology had avoided the study of the armed forces.&lt;ref name=IUSJanowitz/&gt; ''The Professional Soldier'' focused on military elites, as well as those officers who were "destined soon to join the inner-circles of military decision-making"(177).&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Bernard. (1960) "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2127094?seq=1 Book Review]", ''The Journal of Politics''. Vol. 23, No.1. pp.176-78&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Professional Soldier'', Janowitz used a methodology which included content analysis, a survey of 760 generals and admirals and 576 military officers from the Pentagon, and interviews of over 100 high-level officers (995). It revealed the changing nature of organizational authority within the military away from a disciplinary model towards subtler forms of personnel management, reflecting a [[Civil-military relations|convergence]] between the military and civilian spheres. Furthermore, the soldier had become more technical and proficient in its functional means, narrowing the gap between the civilian and military spheres by requiring specialized civilian participation in the more technical capacities of the military. The military also seemed to be experiencing a shift in recruitment trends, wherein the demographics of the military after World War II began to more closely resemble those of the American people. Finally, the leadership of the U.S. Armed Forces had become increasingly politicized. This led Janowitz to  develop a dichotomous [[Epistemology|epistemic]] framework, consisting of two competing perspectives about the proper use of the armed forces in international relations. These perspectives he termed "absolutist" and "pragmatic" (996). Overall these trends, Janowitz argued, resulted in a convergence between military culture and civil society; in other words, the civilianization of the military and the militarization of civil society.&lt;ref name=Maslan&gt;Maslan, John. (1960) "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1952655 Book Review]", ''American Political Science Review'', Vol.54, No.4. pp.995-997.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Janowitz completed his chairmanship of the sociology department at the University of Chicago in 1972, he was able to place more energy into his academic pursuits. These efforts culminated into the development of a trilogy of books published between 1976 and 1983: ''Social Control and the Welfare State'', ''The Last Half-Century,'' and ''The Reconstruction of Patriotism.'' Of these three books, ''The Last Half-Century'' gained perhaps the most notoriety, though all three works never achieved the success that ''The Professional Soldier'' experienced.

===Perspectives On Civil-Military Relations===
After the end of World War II, many began to question the role and size of the peace-time U.S. military, arguing against increased militarization of American culture.&lt;ref&gt;Pearl S. Buck, et al. 1949. "New Evidence of the Militarization of America." National Council Against Conscription.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. Wright Mills. 1956. The Power Elite. Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; Morris Janowitz in ''The Professional Soldier'' (1960) and Samuel Huntington in ''The Soldier and The State'' (1956) formulated two distinct but closely related theories, which provided alternative conceptions to those which emphasized fears of militarization. Both theories concerned the preservation of liberal democracy: Huntington advocated a liberal theory of "objective civilian control" of the military to protect American democracy from foreign threats, while Janowitz advocated a more civic-republican theory, which encouraged active interconnectedness between civil society and the military in order to foster a greater sense of civic participation.&lt;ref&gt;Shields, Patricia. (2006) [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6210.2006.00660.x/abstract Civil-Military Relations:Changing Frontiers]. [[Public Administration Review]].&lt;/ref&gt; These theories were informed by basic historical perspectives about the proper construction of civil-military relations in democratic societies. Huntington's liberal theory of [[civil-military relations]] seemed to flow from thinkers like [[Thomas Hobbes]], who advocated that the role of the military was to protect society from threats emerging from the state of nature present in international relations, unbound by the social contract; and [[John Stuart Mill]], who argued  strenuously that the military must be regulated and controlled by the state so that it may  not pursue its own objectives counter to democratic society. {{citation needed|date=December 2011}}  Janowitz's theory of civil-military relations, on the other hand, seemed to recall the ancient Roman republic, which embraced external conflict as a motivating and cohering force for domestic culture, and encouraged civic participation and a sense of "citizenship" necessary for the maintenance of the nation. His theory was also more centrally concerned with civic virtue, inspired through the role of the active participation of the citizen soldier.&lt;ref name=Theories&gt;Burk, James. (2002). [http://afs.sagepub.com/content/29/1/7.short?rss=1&amp;ssource=mfc Theories of Democratic Civil-Military Relations]. [[Armed Forces &amp; Society]]. Vol. 29, No.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

As James Burk noted, both theories are somewhat outdated and flawed by today's standards. In Burk's words, Huntington's theory "presumes that there is a clearly delineated military sphere defined by war fighting that is independent of the social and political sphere". Huntington's theory is said to have overlooked the transformation in international relations occurring as a result of development of nuclear weapons, the arms race, and the threat of nuclear annihilation and overestimated the ability of nations to define and achieve acceptable ends under such a war fighting context. The other problem with Huntington's theory is that it advocated for a more conservative realism in international relations, requiring a more "spartan" cultural attitude unacceptable to the American people. On the other hand, Janowitz argued that civic participation should be encouraged in American society through the model of the citizen-soldier, but failed to elucidate how such a model would be propagated in the absence of mass-mobilization for major wars. One such method would have been embedding military service within a voluntary national service system, an idea which never found political support in American politics.&lt;ref name=Theories/&gt;

===Pragmatism===
Janowitz earned a bachelor's degree in economics from Washington Square College of New York University ([[New York University]]), where he studied under [[Sidney Hook]], prominent pragmatist and former student of [[John Dewey]]. Hook exposed Janowitz to Dewey's philosophy of American [[pragmatism]] at an early age, though he did not fully explore pragmatism's  philosophical foundations in sociology until after founding the Heritage of Sociology series at the University of Chicago. Sociology had been weakly tied to pragmatism at the Chicago School through George Herbert Mead and the theory of [[symbolic interaction]], which emphasized a micro-social research agenda.&lt;ref name=Introduction:PragmaticSociology/&gt;

Janowitz also utilized pragmatism in his characterization of attitudes among military leadership. In ''The Professional Soldier'', Janowitz noted during the Vietnam era a prolonged debate in the officer corp "about the legitimacy of strategic objectives and specific military tactics," which unfolded under two dominant perspectives about the appropriate role of the military in international relations: absolutist and pragmatist. Absolutists were military officers "who thought more in terms of conventional definitions of victory," while pragmatists were those "who thought in terms of changing realities, nuclear weapons and national liberation movements"(xli). Janowitz traced these attitudes historically to competing perspectives about the European and East Asian theaters of war during WWII, noting "a strong continuity between an officer's estimate of the conduct of World War II and his contemporary adherence to pragmatic or absolute doctrine".{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Those who defined the European theater of war as a "measured success" were more likely to adhere to a pragmatic doctrine, while those who viewed the European theater as a failure tended to be more absolutist. Moreover, the absolutist perspective was associated with an emphasis on and preference for naval strategy (emanating from [[Alfred Thayer Mahan|Alfred Thayer Mahan's]] theories of naval power) and strategy based on air power, which were both better suited to conflict in East Asia rather than Europe. In the Cold War period, adherents of both perspectives adapted to the new realities of nuclear warfare through a shared belief in nuclear deterrence, but diverged into competing sub-doctrines of "massive and graduated deterrence".{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Thus, absolutists tended to side with Gen. Macarthur's proposal to commence a strategic nuclear bombing of China during the Korean War in order to achieve absolute military victory, while pragmatists were more likely to support limited wars suitable to achieving political objectives.&lt;ref&gt;Janowitz, Morris.

'''Nicolaism''' (also '''Nicholaism''', '''Nicolaitism''', '''Nicolationism''', or '''Nicolaitanism''') is a [[Christian heresy]] first mentioned (twice) in the [[Book of Revelation]] of the [[New Testament]], whose adherents were called '''Nicolaitans''', '''Nicolaitanes''', or '''Nicolaites'''. According to Revelation 2:6 and 15,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Revelation|2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; they were known in the cities of [[Ephesus]] and [[Pergamum]]. In this chapter, the church at Ephesus is commended for "[hating] the works of the Nicolaites, which I also hate"; and the church in Pergamos is rebuked: "So thou hast also some [worshiping in their midst] who hold the teaching of the Nicolaites".

Several of the early church fathers mentioned this group, including [[Irenaeus]], [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Philosophumena]]'', vii. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]], and [[Theodoret]], stating that [[Seven Deacons|deacon Nicolas]] was the author of the heresy and the sect.

==Bible passages==
The Bible mentions the Nicolaites in the second chapter of the Book of Revelation:

Revelation 2 ([[Confraternity Version]])

Verse 6 “But this thou [the church of Ephesus] hast: thou hatest the works of the Nicolaites, which I [Jesus Christ] also hate.”

Verses 14-16 “But I have a few things against thee [the church in Pergamos], because thou hast there some who hold the teaching of [[Balaam]], who taught Balak to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, that they might eat and commit fornication. So thou hast also some who hold the teaching of the Nicolaites. In like manner repent; or else I will come to thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.”

==Bishop Isidore of Seville==

The last Western Church Father was [[Isidore of Seville]], who finished the ''[[Etymologiae|Etymologies]]'', or the ''Origins'', in the year 636 A.D. In Book VIII titled "The Church and sects (De ecclesia et sects)" he wrote, "The Nicolaites (Nicolaita) are so called from Nicolas, deacon of the church of Jerusalem, who, along with Stephen and the others, was ordained by Peter. He abandoned his wife because of her beauty, so that whoever wanted to might enjoy her; the practice turned into debauchery, with partners being exchanged in turn. Jesus condemns them in the Apocalypse, saying (2:6): “But this thou hast, that thou hates the deeds of the Nicolaites.”&lt;ref&gt;The Etymologies of Isidore of Seville stephen a. barney, w. j . lewi s , j . a. beach, oliver berghof with the collaboration of muriel hall, Cambridge University Press, © Stephen A. Barney, W. J. Lewis, J. A. Beach and Oliver Berghof, 2006, page 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Insight into Church History==
[[John Henry Blunt]] points out that the Bible condemns the false teachings, and the use of a name to describe a group "shows that there was a distinct heretical party which held the doctrine." The letters which Jesus dictates for the churches in Revelation 2 "show that these heretics had neither formally separated themselves from the Church nor had been excommunicated."&lt;ref name=Blunt&gt;{{cite book|title=Dictionary of Sects, Heresies, Ecclesiastical Parties, and Schools of Religious Thought|editor=John Henry Blunt M.A., F.S.A.|publisher=Rivingtons|location=London|year=1874}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations==
A common view holds that the Nicolaitans held the [[Antinomianism|antinomian]] heresy of [[1 Corinthians 6]], although this has not been proved.&lt;ref name=CE1913&gt;{{cite CE1913 |last= Healy |first= Patrick Joseph |wstitle= Nicolaites}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One scholar who espouses this interpretation, [[John Henry Blunt]], maintains that the comparison between the Nicolaitans and Balaam "proves that the fornication spoken of is not that crime under ordinary circumstances, but fornication connected with religious rites".&lt;ref name=Blunt/&gt; Blunt points out that the Hebrews had a long history of preaching against or alternatively using cult prostitutes (Genesis 38:21-22; Deuteronomy 23:17-8; 1 Kings 14:24, 15:12, 22:46; 2 Kings 23:7; Ezekiel 16:16; Hosea 4:14). He also points out that the early Christians lived in a pagan culture where the worship of [[Aphrodite#Cult of Aphrodite|Aphrodite]] included ''hierodoule'' who engaged in [[ritual prostitution]] in her shrines and temples, and that the [[Dionysian Mysteries]] used intoxicants and other trance-inducing techniques to remove inhibitions and social constraints of believers (regardless of class or gender) to enter into an animalistic state of mind.

Blunt holds that the Nicolaitans believed either that the command against ritual sex was part of the Mosaic law (from which they had been freed by Jesus Christ) and it was licit for them, or that they went too far during Christian "love-feasts". Blunt sees echoes of this behavior in the admonishments which Paul gives the Corinthians, though he does not name them as such. Blunt also believes that similar echoes can be found in the admonishments of Jude 4-16 (which invokes both "Balaam's error" and "love feasts") and 2 Peter 2:2-21 (which repeats much of Jude's statements, including invoking Balaam).&lt;ref name=Blunt/&gt;

The trend began early in Christianity of applying the term "Nicolaitans" to describe other antinomian groups with no attachment to the historical Nicolaitans. [[Tertullian]] in his ''Prescription Against Heretics'', 33, is such an example: "John, however, in the Apocalypse is charged to chastise those 'who eat things sacrificed to idols,' and 'who commit sexual immorality.' There are even now another sort of Nicolaitans. Theirs is called the [[Cainites|Gaian heresy]]."

[[Irenaeus]] in ''[[Adversus Haereses]]'' III. xi. 1; I. xxvi. 3 holds that the [[Gospel of John]] was written to counter the teachings of [[Cerinthus]], which he holds was spread by the Nicolaitans. But when Irenaeus focuses on them later, he only presents them as the Book of Revelation did, with no explanation how they can be held to have the doctrines of Cerinthus.&lt;ref name=Blunt/&gt; Later, [[Augustine of Hippo]] ascribed to them Cerinthian doctrines concerning the creation of the world (in his ''De haeresibus ad Quodvultdeum'', v).

[[Victorinus of Pettau]] held that the error of the Nicolaitans was that they ate things offered to idols.&lt;ref&gt;St. Victorinus of Pettau, ''Commentary on the Apocalypse'', 2.1&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Bede]] states that Nicolas allowed other men to marry his wife.&lt;ref&gt;Bede, ''Explanation of the Apocalypse'', 2.16&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Thomas Aquinas]] believed that Nicholas supported either polygamy or the holding of wives in common.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Summa contra Gentiles|S. C. G.]]'' iii. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Eusebius]] claimed that the sect was short-lived.&lt;ref&gt;''H. E''. iii. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of authors favour another opinion: that the mention of the Nicolaitans is merely a symbolic manner of reference, because of the allegorical character of the [[book of Revelation|Apocalypse]].&lt;ref name=CE1913 /&gt;  As a symbolic reference (according to this view), the "teaching of the Nicolaitans" refers to dominating the people, compared to the "teaching of [[Balaam]]" which refers to seducing the people. John, the author of [[Revelation]], discusses domination within the church in [[3 John]] 9-11.&lt;ref&gt;Hayden, D. (2006). Mindgames. http://www.awordfromtheword.org&lt;/ref&gt; Such a teaching would contradict "whoever would be great among you must be your servant" ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 20:26).

===Etymology===
Those who view the account in Revelation 2 as not literal treat the word "Nicolaitan" not as based upon an individual's name, but as a compound descriptive word. ''Nico-'' means "victory" in Greek, and ''laos'' means "people" or, more specifically, "the laity". Hence they take the word to mean "lay conquerors" or "conquerors of the lay people".

However, "Nicolaitan" (Greek: Νικολαϊτῶν; Νικολαΐτης) is the name ostensibly given to followers of the heretic Nicolas (Greek: Νικόλαος).{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} The name itself means "victorious over people" or "victory of the people", but it is a name that a person would have been given{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} at birth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Nicholas Etymology of the name Nicholas:] "masc. proper name, from Gk. ''Nikolaos'', lit. 'victory-people,' from ''nike'' 'victory' + ''laic'' 'people.'" For the (non-etymological) intrusive "h" in the English spelling of it, cf Ant(h)ony.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name [[Balaam]] is perhaps capable of being interpreted as a Hebrew equivalent of the Greek Nicolas. Some commentators&lt;ref&gt;[[Johannes Cocceius|Cocceius]] (''Cogitat. in Rev''. ii. 6) has the credit of being the first to suggest this identification of the Nicolaitans with the followers of Balaam. He has been followed by the elder [[Campegius Vitringa|Vitringa]] (''Dissert. de Argum. Epist. Petri poster.'' in Hase's ''Thesaurus,'' ii. 987), [[Hengstenberg]] (''in loc''.), Stier (''Words of the Risen Lord'', p. 125 Eng. transl.), and others. [[Joseph Barber Lightfoot|Lightfoot]] (''Hor. Heb.'', in Act. Apost. vi. 5) suggests another and more startling ''[[paronomasia]]''. The word, in his view, was chosen, as identical in sound with  ניכולה, ''Nicolah'', "let us eat", and as thus marking out the special characteristic of the sect.&lt;/ref&gt; think that John alludes to this in Revelation 2:14;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Revelation||2:14|KJV}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Campegius Vitringa|C. Vitringa]]&lt;ref&gt;''Obs. Sacr.'' iv. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; argues forcibly in support of this opinion. However, Albert Barnes notes:
{{quote|Vitringa supposes that the word is derived from νικος, victory, and λαος, people, and that thus it corresponds with the name Balaam, as meaning either ''lord of the people'', or ''he destroyed the people''; and that, as the same effect was produced by their doctrines as by those of Balaam, that the people were led to commit fornication and to join in idolatrous worship, they might be called Balaamites or Nicolaitanes—that is, corrupters of the people. But to this it may be replied,

(a) that it is far-fetched, and is adopted only to remove a difficulty;

(b) that there is every reason to suppose that the word here used refers to a class of people who bore that name, and who were well known in the two churches specified;

(c) that, in  Rev 2:15 , they are expressly distinguished from those who held the doctrine of Balaam,  Rev 2:14—"So hast thou also (και) those that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitanes."|Albert Barnes, ''New Testament Notes''&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/barnes/ntnotes.html Barnes' New Testament Notes.]
&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

[[Cyrus Scofield]] suggests in his ''Notes on the Bible'' that the [[Letters to the seven churches|Seven Letters]] in Revelation foretell the various eras of Christian history, and that "Nicolaitans" "refers to the earliest form of the notion of a priestly order, or 'clergy', which later divided an equal brotherhood into 'priests' and 'laity.'"&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.studylight.org/com/srn/view.cgi?book=re&amp;chapter=002 "Nicolaitanes".]
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nicolas==
The Nicolas of {{bibleverse||Acts|6:5}} was a native of Antioch and a proselyte (convert to Judaism) and then a follower of the way of Christ. When the Church was still confined to Jerusalem, he was chosen by the whole multitude of the disciples to be one of the first [[seven deacons]], and he was ordained by the apostles, ''c.'' AD 33. It has been questioned whether this Nicolas was connected with the Nicolaitans mentioned in Revelation, and if so, how closely.

Irenaeus, was of the opinion that he was their founder.{{quote|The Nicolaitanes are the followers of that Nicolas who was one of the seven first ordained to the diaconate by the apostles. They lead lives of unrestrained indulgence. The character of these men is very plainly pointed out in the Apocalypse of John, [when they are represented] as teaching that it is a matter of indifference to practice adultery, and to eat things sacrificed to idols.|[[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XXVI.|Irenaeus, '' Adversus haereses'', i. 26, §3]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Adversus haereses]]'', i. 26, §3; iii. 11, §1.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Hippolytus of Rome]] shared the opinion that Nicolas became a heresiarch (in ''[[Refutation of All Heresies]]'' vii. 24).&lt;ref name=Blunt/&gt;

In other writings of the early Church this connection is disputed and the Nicolaitans are said to be "falsely so called" (ψευδώνυμοι).&lt;ref&gt;{{ws|[[Ignatius of Antioch|Ignat]]. [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IGNATIUS/Epistle to the Trallians: Shorter and Longer Versions/Chapter XI.|''ad Trall''. xi]]}} (longer version): "Flee also the impure '''Nicolaitanes, falsely so called''', who are lovers of pleasure, and given to calumnious speeches." Cf. {{ws|[[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IGNATIUS/Epistle to the Philadelphians: Shorter and Longer Versions/Chapter VI.|''ad Phil''. vi]]}} (longer version): "If any one ... affirms that unlawful unions are a good thing, and places the highest happiness in pleasure, as does the man who is '''falsely called a Nicolaitan''', this person can neither be a lover of God, nor a lover of Christ, but is a corrupter of his own flesh, and therefore void of the Holy Spirit, and a stranger to Christ." {{ws|[[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume VII/Constitutions of the Holy Apostles/Book VI/Sec. II|''Const. Apost.'' vi]]}}: "... some are impudent in uncleanness, such as those who are '''falsely called Nicolaitans'''."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clement of Alexandria]] put forward a defense of Nicolas (in ''[[Stromata]]'' ii. 20, iii. 4) which [[Eusebius]] accepts and repeats (in ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiastica]]'' iii. 29).&lt;ref name=Blunt/&gt;

===In Epiphanius===
[[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]] relates some details of the life of Nicolas the deacon, and describes him as gradually sinking into the grossest impurity, and becoming the originator of the Nicolaitans and other libertine Gnostic sects:
{{quote|[Nicolas] had an attractive wife, and had refrained from intercourse as though in imitation of those whom he saw to be devoted to God. He endured this for a while but in the end could not bear to control his incontinence.... But because he was ashamed of his defeat and suspected that he had been found out, he ventured to say, "Unless one copulates every day, he cannot have eternal life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Williams |first=Frank |title=The Panarion of Epiphanius of Salamis |year=1987 |publisher=E.J. Brill |location=Leiden; New York; København; Köln |volume=Book I (Sects 1-46) |page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Epiphanius, ''[[Panarion]]'', xxv. 1}}

Hippolytus agreed with Epiphanius in his unfavourable view of Nicolas.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Gobar, Photii ''Biblioth''. §232, p. 291, ed. 1824; ''[[Philosophumena]]'', bk. vii. §36.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Clement of Alexandria===
[[Jerome]] believes the account of Nicolas succumbing to heresy, at least to some extent.&lt;ref&gt;''Ep.'' 147, t. i. p. 1082, ed. Vallars. &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt; This was also the opinion of the unknown Christian author (writing around 435) of ''[[Praedestinatus]]'' (in i. 4.),&lt;ref name=Blunt/&gt; as well  as other writers in the 4th century.

This view of Nicolas is irreconcilable with the traditional account of his character given by Clement of Alexandria,&lt;ref&gt;"Such also are those (who say that they follow Nicolaus, quoting an adage of the man, which they pervert, 'that the flesh must be abused.' But the worthy man showed that it was necessary to check pleasures and lusts, and by such training to waste away the impulses and propensities of the flesh. But they, abandoning themselves to pleasure like goats, as if insulting the body, lead a life of self-indulgence; not knowing that the body is wasted, being by nature subject to dissolution; while their soul is buried in the mire of vice; following as they do the teaching of pleasure itself, not of the apostolic man" (Clement of Alexandria, ''[[Stromata]]'', ii. 20).&lt;/ref&gt; an earlier writer than Epiphanius. He states that Nicolas led a chaste life and brought up his children in purity. He describes a certain occasion when Nicolas had been sharply reproved by the apostles as a jealous husband, and he repelled the charge by offering to allow his wife to become the wife of any other person. Clement also writes that Nicolas was in the habit of repeating a saying which is ascribed to the apostle [[Matthew the Evangelist|Matthias]], ''that it is our duty to fight against the flesh and to abuse'' (παραχρῆσθαι) ''it''. His words were perversely interpreted by the Nicolaitans as authority for their immoral practices.&lt;ref&gt;“But when we spoke about the saying of Nicolaus we omitted to say this. Nicolaus, they say, had a lovely wife. When after the Saviour's ascension he was accused before the apostles of jealousy, he brought his wife into the concourse and allowed anyone who so desired to marry her. For, they say, this action was appropriate to the saying: 'One must abuse the flesh.' ... I am informed, however, that Nicolaus never had relations with any woman other than the wife he married, and that of his children his daughters remained virgins to their old age, and his son remained uncorrupted. In view of this it was an act of suppression of passion when he brought before the apostles the wife on whose account he was jealous. He taught what it meant to 'abuse the flesh' by restraining the distracting passions. For, as the Lord commanded, he did not wish to serve two masters, pleasure and God. It is said that Matthias also taught that one should fight the flesh and abuse it, never allowing it to give way to licentious pleasure, so that the soul might grow by faith and knowledge” (Clement of Alexandria, ''Stromata'', iii. 4, §§25-26; and ''apud'' [[s:Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers: Series II/Volume I/Church History of Eusebius/Book III/Chapter 29|Euseb. ''H. E''. iii. 29]]; see also [[s:Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers: Series II/Volume I/Church History of Eusebius/Book III/Chapter 25|footnote 31 in Chapter 25 of ''NPNF'']]).&lt;/ref&gt; Theodoret repeats the foregoing statement of Clement in his account of the sect, and charges the Nicolaitans with false dealing in borrowing the name of the deacon.&lt;ref&gt;''Haeret. Fab.'' iii. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Clement (in ''Stromata'' 3, 2) does condemn heretics whose views on sex he sees as licentious, but he does not associate them with Nicolas:

:But the followers of [[Carpocrates]] and Epiphanes think that wives should be common property. Through them the worst calumny has become current against the Christian name. ...he [Epiphanes] says [in his book ''Concerning Righteousness''] that the idea of Mine and Thine came into existence through the [Mosaic] laws so that the earth and money were no longer put to common use. And so also with marriage. 'For God has made vines for all to use in common, since they are not protected against sparrows and a thief; and similarly corn and the other fruits. But the abolition, contrary to divine law, of community of use and equality begat the thief of domestic animals and fruits. He brought female to be with male and in the same way united all animals. He thus showed righteousness to be a universal fairness and equality. But those who have been born in this way have denied the universality which is the corollary of their birth and say, "Let him who has taken one woman keep her," whereas all alike can have her, just as the other animals do.' After this, which is quoted word for word, he again continues in the same spirit as follows: 'With a view to the permanence of the race, he has implanted in males a strong and ardent desire which neither law nor custom nor any other restraint is able to destroy. For it is God's decree. ...Consequently one must understand the saying "Thou shalt not covet" as if the lawgiver was making a jest, to which he added the even more comic words "thy neighbor's goods". For he himself who gave the desire to sustain the race orders that it is to be suppressed, though he removes it from no other animals. And by the words "thy neighbor's wife" he says something even more ludicrous, since he forces what should be common property to be treated as a private possession.'[/quote]

Clement asks: 
:And how can this man still be reckoned among our number when he openly abolishes both law and gospel by these words...Carpocrates fights against God, and Epiphanes likewise. ...These, so they say, and certain other enthusiasts for the same wickedness, gather together for feasts (I would not call their meeting an ''[[Agape]]''), men and women together. After they have sated their appetites ('on repletion [[Horae#The ten or twelve Hours|Cypris]], the goddess of love, enters,' as it is said), then they overturn the lamps and so extinguish the light that the shame of their adulterous 'righteousness' is hidden, and they have intercourse where they will and with whom they will. After they have practiced community of use in this love-feast, they demand by daylight of whatever women they wish that they will be obedient to the law of Carpocrates-it would not be right to say the law of God. ...Of these and other similar sects Jude, I think, spoke prophetically in his letter - 'In the same way also these dreamers'[Jude 1:8] (for they do not seek to find the truth in the light of day) as far as the words 'and their mouth speaks arrogant things.'[Jude 1:16]

===Eusebius===
Eusebius speaks directly about the Nicolaitans and Nicolas (in his ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiastica]]'' iii, 29), saying "At this time the so-called sect of the Nicolaitans made its appearance and lasted for a very short time. Mention is made of it in the Apocalypse of John. They boasted that the author of their sect was Nicolaus, one of the deacons who, with Stephen, were appointed by the apostles for the purpose of ministering to the poor."

Eusebius repeats Clement's story about Nicolas and his wife and holds that those he decries as heretics are claiming his name for their sect because they misunderstand the context of his presentation of his wife to the apostles and are "imitating blindly and foolishly that which was done and said, [in order to] commit fornication without shame. But I understand that Nicolaus had to do with no other woman than her to whom he was married, and that, so far as his children are concerned, his daughters continued in a state of virginity until old age, and his son remained uncorrupt. If this is so, when he brought his wife, whom he jealously loved, into the midst of the apostles, he was evidently renouncing his passion; and when he used the expression, 'to abuse the flesh,' he was inculcating self-control in the face of those pleasures that are eagerly pursued. For I suppose that, in accordance with the command of the Savior, he did not wish to serve two masters, pleasure and the Lord [Matthew 6:24; Luke 16:13]. ...So much concerning those who then attempted to pervert the truth, but in less time than it has taken to tell it became entirely extinct."

[[Eusebius]] (in his ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiastica]]'', iv, 7) held that as Satan was shut off from using persecution against Christians "he devised all sorts of plans, and employed other methods in his conflict with the Church, using base and deceitful men as instruments for the ruin of souls and as ministers of destruction. Instigated by him, impostors and deceivers, assuming the name of our religion, brought to the depth of ruin such of the believers as they could win over, and at the same time, by means of the deeds which they practiced, turned away from the path which leads to the word of salvation those who were ignorant of the faith." He traces heresy from the Biblical figure of [[Simon Magus]] (Acts 8:9-29) through [[Menander (gnostic)|Menander]] to both Saturnius of Antioch and [[Basilides]] of Alexandria. Following Irenaeus, Eusebius says "Basilides, under the pretext of unspeakable mysteries, invented monstrous fables, and carried the fictions of his impious heresy quite beyond bounds." He reports that Christian author [[Agrippa Castor]] "While exposing his mysteries he says that Basilides wrote twenty-four books upon the Gospel, and that he invented prophets for himself named Barcabbas and Barcoph, and others that had no existence, and that he gave them barbarous names in order to amaze those who marvel at such things; that he taught also that the eating of meat offered to idols and the unguarded renunciation of the faith in times of persecution were matters of indifference; and that he enjoined upon his followers, like Pythagoras, a silence of five years. ...Thus it came to pass that the malignant demon, making use of these ministers, on the one hand enslaved those that were so pitiably led astray by them to their own destruction, while on the other hand he furnished to the unbelieving heathen abundant opportunities for slandering the divine word, inasmuch as the reputation of these men brought infamy upon the whole race of Christians. In this way, therefore, it came to pass that there was spread abroad in regard to us among the unbelievers of that age, the infamous and most absurd suspicion that we practiced unlawful commerce with mothers and sisters, and enjoyed impious feasts." Here a doctrine of indifference concerning eating meat sacrificed to idols is put forward along with a doctrine of licentious sex, but no mention of Nicolaitanes is made nor blame assigned to Nicolas.

===Justin Martyr===
[[Justin Martyr]] (in ''[[Dialogue with Trypho]]'', 35) also discusses the fact "that many of those who say that they confess Jesus, and are called Christians, eat meats offered to idols, and declare that they are by no means injured in consequence." He says such people are "confessing themselves to be Christians, and admitting the crucified Jesus to be both Lord and Christ, yet not teaching His doctrines, but those of the spirits of error. ...[They are those who] teach to blaspheme the Maker of all things, and Christ, who was foretold by Him as coming, and the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, with whom we have nothing in common, since we know them to be atheists, impious, unrighteous, and sinful, and confessors of Jesus in name only, instead of worshipers of Him. Yet they style themselves Christians, just as certain among the Gentiles inscribe the name of God upon the works of their own hands, and partake in nefarious and impious rites." Justin holds their existence furthers the true faith as it is proof of Christian Scriptural prophecy about the rise of false teachers (Matthew 7:15, 24:11; 1 Corinthians 11:19). He declares that they are those ...who, coming forward in the name of Jesus, taught both to speak and act impious and blasphemous things; and these are called by us after the name of the men from whom each doctrine and opinion had its origin." Despite the similar charge of eating "meats offered to idols" Justin does not link the groups with Nicolaitanes or Nicolas - rather saying "Some are called [[Marcion of Sinope|Marcians]], and some [[Valentinianism|Valentinians]], and some [[Basilideans|Basilidians]], and some [[Saturnilians]], and others by other names; each called after the originator of the individual opinion...the name of the father of the particular doctrine."

===In modern criticism===
Among later critics, [[Cotelerius]] seems to lean towards the favourable view of the character of Nicolas in a note on ''[[Apostolic Constitutions|Constit. Apost]].'' vi. 8, after reciting the various authorities. [[Edward Burton (theologian)|Edward Burton]]&lt;ref&gt;''Lectures on Ecclesiastical History'', Lect. xii. p. 364, ed. 1833.&lt;/ref&gt; was of opinion that the origin of the term Nicolaitans is uncertain, and that, "though Nicolas the deacon has been mentioned as their founder, the evidence is extremely slight which would convict that person himself of any immoralities."

[[Tillemont]]&lt;ref&gt;''H. E.'' ii. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; was possibly influenced by the fact that no honour is paid to the memory of Nicolas by any branch of the Church. He allows more weight to the testimony against him, and peremptorily rejects Cassian's statement (to which [[August Neander|Neander]]&lt;ref&gt;''Planting of the Church'', bk. v. p. 390, ed. Bonn.&lt;/ref&gt; adheres) that some other Nicolas was the founder of the sect. Tillemont concludes that, if not the actual founder, he was so unfortunate as to give occasion to the formation of the sect by his indiscreet speaking. [[Grotius]]' view is given in a note on Revelation 2:6&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Revelation||2:6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and is substantially the same as that of Tillemont.

===Other views===
Some believe&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Denison Whedon “A popular commentary on the New Testament” New York: Phillips &amp; Hunt (1880) Vol.V Titus-Revelation, Page 342: "Later, and so less trustworthy, authorities exculpate Nicolas, under excuse either that he was misunderstood by his followers or that they claimed his authority falsely, or that it was another Nicolas, a bishop of Samaria, who was their real founder."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Hastings  “Encyclopædia of Religion and Ethics” New York: Charles Scribner's Sons (1917) Vol. 9  Page 364: "Another Nicolas than the deacon must in consequence be sought as the founder of the immoral party at Pergamum. The name was not uncommon, and exact identification is not at present possible. According to pseudo-Dorotheus, there was a Nicolas, bishop of Samaria, who fell into heresy and evil ways under the influence of Simon Magus."&lt;/ref&gt; that it was another Nicolas, rather than Nicolas the Deacon himself becoming an apostate. Another possibility is that it was someone closely connected with Nicolas, such as his one son who became bishop of Samaria, where Gnosticism originated before spreading to the [[Anatolia]]n cities of Pergamum and Ephesus in the Roman province of Asia (minor), also known as [[proconsular Asia]]:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30640">{{Nihongo|'''Nihonjinron'''|日本人論||"theories/discussions about the [[Japanese people|Japanese]]"}}, is a genre of texts that focus on issues of Japanese national and cultural identity. Such texts share a general assumption of the uniqueness of [[Japan]], and the term ''nihonjinron'' can be employed to refer to this outlook.

The concept became popular after [[World War II]], with books and articles aiming to analyze, explain, or explore peculiarities of [[Japanese culture]] and [[mentality]], usually by comparison with those of [[Europe]] and the [[United States]]. The literature is vast, ranging over such varied fields as [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[anthropology]], [[history]], [[linguistics]], [[philosophy]], [[biology]], [[chemistry]] and [[physics]] so in addition to the common generic word ''nihonjinron'', a variety of topical subgenres exist, divided up by  specific theme or subject-matter. For example:

* ''shinfūdoron'' (新風土論): "new theories on climate" (implying the influence of climate on peoples)
* ''nihonbunkaron'' (日本文化論): "theories on Japanese culture"
* ''nihonshakairon'' (日本社会論): "theories on Japanese society"
* ''nihonron'' (日本論): "theories on Japan"
* ''nihonkeizairon'' (日本経済論) "theories on the Japanese economy"

Books written by non-Japanese authors may also be classed as ''nihonjinron,'' if they share, contribute to, or reflect the vision, premises, and perspectives characteristic of the Japanese genre.

==History==
{{Original research section|date=March 2015}}&lt;!-- As of 2015/03/29, this section consists of roughly 2,400 words, and includes only 12 cited references. Phrases like "it is nonetheless true", "not only might the roots of the nihonjinron be traced", "One can hear an early echo of the problem", "there seems no doubt" ... all need to have been used somewhere else in reliable secondary sources before Wikipedia can start using them. ~~User:Hijiri88~~ --&gt;

There seems no doubt that intense feelings for one's native country and its identity were an early part of Japanese literary culture, and a value given aesthetic expression. Robert Borgen studies just one example from the life of the monk [[Jōjin]] ({{lang|ja|成尋}}, 1011–1081) and remarks:

:'He helps us understand Japanese national identity in the 11th century. His nationalism&amp;mdash;and, problematic though it may be, that term will be used&amp;mdash;was not of the bellicose sort, but rather seemed to reflect an accurate awareness of cultural and political differences combined with a sense of self-confidence.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Borgen|first=Robert |url= http://www.meijigakuin.ac.jp/~pmjs/papers/borgen_jojin.html |title= Japanese Nationalism: Ancient and Modern |accessdate=May 1, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hiroshi Minami, one of the foremost scholars of the genre, states in his survey:

:'It is also possible to trace back and locate works worthy of the name "nihonjinron" to the Edo period and even before that.'&lt;ref&gt;Hiroshi Minami,''Nihonjinron no keifu,''1980 p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

The roots of the nihonjinron be traced back at least to the [[kokugaku]] (国学, "national studies") movement of the 18th century, with themes that are not dissimilar to those in the post-war nihonjinron.

===Early themes===
{{Original research section|date=March 2015}}&lt;!-- Well over half of this section deals with the Kamakura-Muromachi periods. If sources call this period "prehistory" or somehow connect these data to the prehistory of Japan, we need to cite them. Doese EVERYTHING in this section come from Dale 1994, cited once at the end of the third paragraph?--&gt;
The problem of Japanese identity in much of the early period is in terms of the local traditions and the powerful influence of Chinese culture, for example the revolt of the anti-Buddhist [[Mononobe]] and [[Nakatomi clan|Nakatomi]] clans against the pro-Buddhist [[Soga clan|Soga]] clan, which had sponsored the introduction of not only Buddhist metaphysics but also Chinese statecraft into Japan in the 6th century.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;!-- A source is needed that not only connects the Mononobe-Nakatomi to Kokugaku AND Nihonjinron, but Nihonjinron to Kokugaku. Otherwise this is just OR. --&gt;

Later, [[Kitabatake Chikafusa]] (1293–1354) wrote his [[Jinnō Shōtōki]] ("Chronicles of the Authentic Lineages of the Divine Emperors"&lt;!-- Why the plural on "Chronicle" and "Lineage"? Where does this translation come from? --&gt;) which defines Japan's superiority in terms of the divinity of its imperial line and the divinity of the nation itself (''Shinkoku''). The general drift of such works is to pull the abstract, universal language and thought of Japan's foreign models down to earth, to reframe it in Japanese conditions, among the illiterate population at large, and assert the special historical characteristics of Japan as opposed to the civilizations which had, until that time, endowed the country with the lineaments of a universalist culture.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Dale,'Nipponologies (Nihon-ron. Nihon-shugi)', 1994 p. 355&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 16th century European contacts with Japan gave rise to a considerable literature by travelers and foreign missionaries on the Japanese, their culture, behavior, and patterns of thinking. In turn this had some impact on Japanese self-images, when this material began to be read by many Japanese after the Meiji Restoration; and this tradition of cross-cultural discourse forms an important background component in the rise of the modern nihonjinron.

===Kokugaku===
Kokugaku, beginning as a scholarly investigation into the philology of Japan's early classical literature, sought to recover and evaluate these texts, some of which were obscure and difficult to read, in order to appraise them positively and harvest them to determine and ascertain what were the original indigenous values of Japan before the introduction of Chinese civilization. Thus the exploration of early classical texts like the ''[[Kojiki]]'' and the ''[[Man'yōshū]]'' allowed scholars of Kokugaku, particularly the five great figures of [[Keichū]] (1640–1701),  [[Kada no Azumamaro]] (1669–1736), [[Kamo no Mabuchi]] (1697–1769), [[Motoori Norinaga]] (1730–1801) and [[Hirata Atsutane]] (1776–1843)&lt;ref&gt;Minamoto Ryōen, ''Tokugawa Shisō Shōshi'', Chūkō Shinsho, Tokyo 1973 p. 178, corrects the traditional figure of four great founders, which excluded Keichū&lt;/ref&gt; to explore Japan's cultural differences with China, locate their sources in high antiquity, and deploy the results in a programmatic attempt to define the uniqueness of Japan against a foreign civilization. These scholars worked independently, and reached different conclusions, but by the 19th century were grouped together by a neo-Kokugakuist named Konakamura to establish the earliness of Japanese self-awareness.&lt;ref&gt;Susan L. Burns. ''Before the Nation''. Duke University Press, 2003. p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; Implicitly or otherwise, they advocated a return to these ostensibly pristine ethnic roots, which involved discarding the incrustations of those Chinese cultural beliefs, social rites and philosophical ideas that had exercised a political ascendancy for over a millennium within Japan and had deeply informed the neo-Confucian ideology of the Tokugawa regime itself.

The irony was that the intellectual techniques, textual methods and cultural strategies used by nativist scholars against Confucianism borrowed heavily from currents in both Chinese thought (Taoist, Confucian and Buddhist) and their Japanese offshoots. Motoori, the greatest nativist scholar, is deeply indebted, for instance, to the thought of [[Ogyū Sorai]]  the most penetrating Confucian thinker of Tokugawa times. In similar wise, scholars detect in modern Japanese nationalism, of which the nihonjinron are the resonant if melodiously subdued, post-war echo, many features that derived from borrowings abroad, from the large resources of cultural nationalism mined in European countries during their own respective periods of nation-formation. Under the alias of assertions of difference, nationalisms, in Japan as elsewhere, borrow promiscuously from each other's conceptual hoards, and what may seem alien turns out often to be, once studied closely, merely an exotic variation on an all too familiar theme.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===Meiji period===
In the second half of the 19th century, under strong military and diplomatic pressure, and suffering from an internal crisis that led to the collapse of the [[Bakufu]], Japan opened its ports, and subsequently the nation, to commerce with the outside world and reform that sought to respond vigorously to the challenges of modern industrial polities, as they were remarked on by Japanese observers in the United States and Europe. The preponderant place of China as model and cultural adversary in the cognitive models developed hitherto was occupied by the West. But, whereas Japan's traditional engagement with Chinese civilization was conducted in terms of a unilateral debate, now Japanese scholars and thinkers could read directly what Westerners, themselves fascinated by the 'exoticism' of Japanese culture, said and wrote of them. Japanese contact with, and responses to these emerging Western stereotypes, which reflected the superiority complex, condescension and imperial hauteur of the times, fed into Japanese debates on national identity. As Leslie Pincus puts it, speaking of a later phase:
: "one might say that Japanese travelers reappropriated Japan from Europe as an exoticized object. Just as [[ukiyo-e]] were first reimported back into Japan from Paris museums and private European collections after World War 1, less tangible aspects of the cultural past were newly rediscovered by Japanese visitors in Europe. But whether material or ethereal, the artifacts of Japanese culture had become indelibly inflected by Europe's fascination with, or depreciation of, one of its cultural others."&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Pincus,''Authenticating Culture in Imperial Japan '' University of California Press, 1996 p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

There ensued an intense period of massive social and economic change, as, under the direction of a developmental elite, Japan moved from the closed world of centuries of Tokugawa rule (the so-called ''sakoku'' [鎖国] period) to Meiji Westernization, and, again in close conformity with the prevailing occidental paradigm, to imperialist adventurism with the growth of the [[Empire of Japan|colonialism]]. The [[Taishō period]] marked a slightly more 'liberal' turn, as the pendulum swung towards a renewed interest in the Western model ("Japan must undergo a second birth, with America as its new mother and France as its father"). With the crisis of 1929 and the concomitant depression of the 1930s, militarism gained the upper hand in this era of the 'dark valley' (''kurai tanima'', 暗い谷間), and nationalistic ideologies prevailed over all attempts to keep alive the moderate traditions of liberal modernity.

===Postwar period===
Total economic, military and spiritual mobilization could not stave off defeat however, and slowly, under occupation, and then rapidly with its reasserted independence, Japan enjoyed a decades-long resurgence as global industrial and economic powerhouse until the crisis of the 1990s. The cultural patterns over this century long trajectory is one of a continuous oscillation between models of pronounced Westernization and traditionalist [[autarky]]. Between the two alternatives, attempts were frequently made to mediate a conciliatory third way which would combine the best of both worlds (''wakon yōsai'', (和魂洋才): "Japanese spirit and Western techniques".&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Hirakawa Sukehiro (平川祐弘),''Wakon Yōsai no keifu'', Kawade Bungei Shinsho,1976 passim&lt;/ref&gt;

The frequency of these chronic transitional upheavals engendered a remarkable intensity of debate about national directions and identity (''kokuminsei'', 国民性/''minzokusei'', 民族性), whose complexity over time renders a synthetic judgment or bird's-eye view of the literature in question rather difficult. A major controversy surrounds the question regarding the affiliation of the post-war nihonjinron theories with the prewar conceptualization of Japanese cultural uniqueness. To what degree, that is, are these meditations under democracy on Japanese uniqueness innocent reflections of a popular search for identity, and in what measure, if any, do they pick up from the instrumental ideology of Japaneseness developed by government and nationalists in the prewar period to harness the energies of the nation towards industrialization and global imperium?

The questions are rendered more complex by the fact that in the early post-war period, the restoration of a 'healthy nationalism' was by no means something exclusive to right-wing cultural thinkers. An intense debate over the necessity to develop ideal, positive forms of national consciousness, regarded as a healthy civic identity, figures prominently in the early writings of [[Masao Maruyama (scholar)|Maruyama Masao]], who called for a healthy "national civic consciousness" (''kokuminshugi'', 国民主義), and in the prolific debates of members of the Japanese Historical Science Association (rekiken, 歴研) who preferred to speak of 'ethnic national consciousness'(''minzokushigi'', 民族主義). These debates ranged from liberal center-left critics to radical Marxist historians.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis A Gayle,''Marxist History and Postwar Japanese Nationalism'' 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars cite the destruction of many Japanese national symbols and the psychological blow of defeat at the end of [[World War II]] as one source of nihonjinron's enduring popularity, although it is not a uniquely 20th century phenomenon. In fact the genre is simply the Japanese reflex of cultural nationalism, which is a property of all modern nations. The trend of the tone of nihonjinron argument is often reflective of the Japanese society at the time. Peter Dale, covering the period analysed by the Nomura survey, distinguished three major phrases in the development of post-war ''nihonjinron'' discourse:

*First phase (1945–1960): Dominance of the Western model with a concomitant repudiation of Japanese specificity.
*Second phase (1960–1970): Recognition of historical relativity, of certain defects in Western industrial society, and certain merits in Japanese traditions, as they are re-engineered in Japanese modernization.
*Third phase (1970-?): Recognition of Japanese specificity as a positive model for a uniquely Japanese road towards modernity and its global outreach.&lt;ref&gt;Dale,''The Myth of Japanese Uniqueness,'' 1986 p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;

Tamotsu Aoki subsequently finessed the pattern by distinguishing four major phases in the post war identity discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Aoki 1990 p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

In Dale's proposal, this drift from negative uniqueness to positive evaluation of uniqueness is a cyclical trend, since he believes the same pattern can be detected in the literature on identity for the period from 1867 to 1945, from early Meiji times down to the end of World War Two. Nihonjinron, in Dale's view, recycle prewar Japanese nationalist rhetoric, and betray similar ends. For Aoki, contrariwise, they are natural movements in a national temper which seeks, as has been the case with other nations, its own distinctive path of cultural autonomy and social organization as Japan adapts itself to the global world order forged by the West.

During the early post-war period, most of nihonjinron discourses discussed the uniqueness of the Japanese in a rather negative, critical light. The elements of feudalism reminiscent of the [[Imperial Japan]] were all castigated as major obstacles to Japan's reestablishment as a new democratic nation. Scholars such as Hisao Ōtsuka ({{lang|ja|大塚久男}}), a [[Max Weber|Weberian]] sociologist, judged Japan with the measure of rational individualism and liberal democracy that were considered ideals in the U.S. and Western European nations back then.&lt;ref&gt;Sugimoto &amp; Mouer,''Images of Japanese Society'' 1986 pp. 70-71&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1970s, however, with Japan enjoying a remarkable economic boom, Ōtsuka began to consider the 'feudal residues' in a positive light, as a badge of Japan's distinctive difference from the West (Ōtsuka, Kawashima, Doi 1976 passim). Nihonjinron books written during the period of high economic growth up to the bubble burst in the early 1990s, in contrast, argued various unique features of the Japanese as more positive features.

==Specific theses==

# The Japanese race is a unique isolate, having no known affinities with any other race. In some extreme versions, the race is claimed to be directly descended from a distinct branch of primates.&lt;ref&gt;(1)Watanabe Shōichi, Nihongo no kokoro, Kōsansha Gendai Shinsho, Tokyo 1954.pp.11f (2) [[Oguma Eiji]],''Tan'itsu minzoku shinwa no kigen,'' Shin'yōsha, Tokyo 1995&lt;/ref&gt;
# This [[island ecology|isolation]] is due to the peculiar circumstances of living in an {{Nihongo|island country|島国|shimaguni}} cut off from the promiscuous cross-currents of continental history, with its endless miscegenation of tribes and cultures. The island country in turn enjoys a {{Nihongo|''[[sui generis]]'' climate|風土|fūdo}} whose peculiar rhythms, the putative fact for example that Japan alone has {{Nihongo|four distinct seasons|四季|shiki}}, color Japanese thinking and behaviour. Thus, human nature in Japan is, peculiarly, an extension of nature itself.&lt;ref&gt;(1) Watsuji Tetsurō, ''Fūdo'', Iwanami Shoten 1935 passim; (2)Dale,''Myth of Japanese Uniqueness'', ibid. pp.43f.&lt;/ref&gt;
# The Japanese language has a unique grammatical structure and native lexical corpus whose idiosyncratic syntax and connotations condition the Japanese to think in peculiar patterns unparalleled in other human languages. The Japanese language is also uniquely vague.&lt;ref&gt;Morimoto, Tetsurō (森本哲朗) ''Nihongo Omote to Ura'' (日本語表と裏) ("Japanese inside and outside") Shinchōsha Tokyo 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Foreigners who speak it fluently therefore, may be correct in their usage, but the thinking behind it remains inalienably soaked in the alien framework of their original language's thought patterns. This is the Japanese version of the [[Linguistic relativity|Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]], according to which grammar determines world-view.&lt;ref&gt;(1)Suzuki Takao,'' Kotoba no ningengaku'', Shinchō Bunko, Tokyo 1981.pp.109ff;(2) Itasaka Gen, ''Nihongo yokochō,'' Kōdansha Gakujutsu Bunko, Tokyo 1978 pp.69ff; (3)Kawashima Takeyoshi in Ōtsuka Hisao, Kawashima Takeyoshi, Doi Takeo, '' 'Amae’ to shakai kagaku,'' Kōbundō, Tokyo 1978 p.29&lt;/ref&gt;
#Japanese psychology, influenced by the language, is defined by a particular cast of {{Nihongo|dependency wishes or desires|甘え|amae}} that conduce to a unique form of {{Nihongo|'human relationship'|人間関係|ningen kankei}}, in which clearly defined boundaries between self and other are ambiguous or fluid, leading to a psychomental and social ideal of the {{Nihongo|fusion of ego and alter|自他合一|jita gōitsu}}.&lt;ref&gt;Dale,''Myth of Japanese Uniqueness'', ibid. ch.7,8 pp.116-175, ch.12 pp.201ff.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Japanese social structures consistently remould human associations in terms of an archaic {{Nihongo|family or household model|家|ie}} characterized by {{Nihongo|vertical relations|縦社会|tate-shakai}}, {{Nihongo|clan|氏|uji}}, and {{Nihongo|(foster-)parent-child patterns|親分・子分|oyabun, kobun}}. As a result, the {{Nihongo|individual|個人|kojin}} cannot properly exist, since {{Nihongo|groupism|集団主義|shūdan-shugi}} will always prevail.&lt;ref&gt;Dale,''Myth of Japanese Uniqueness'', ibid. ch.7 pp.100ff&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nihonjinron as cultural nationalism==
Scholars such as Peter N. Dale (1986), Harumi Befu (1987), and Kosaku Yoshino (1992) view nihonjinron more critically, identifying it as a tool for enforcing social and political [[conformity]]. Dale, for example, characterizes nihonjinron as follows:

:"First, they implicitly assume that the Japanese constitute a culturally and socially homogeneous racial entity, whose essence is virtually unchanged from prehistoric times down to the present day. Secondly, they presuppose that the Japanese differ radically from all other known peoples. Thirdly, they are conspicuously nationalistic, displaying a conceptual and procedural hostility to any mode of analysis which might be seen to derive from external, non-Japanese sources. In a general sense then, nihonjinron may be defined as works of cultural nationalism concerned with ostensible 'uniqueness' of Japan in any aspect, and which are hostile to both individual experience and the notion of internal socio-historical diversity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shepherd |first=Gregory |url=http://home.sprintmail.com/~emrichards/shepherd.html |title=Music of Japan Today: Tradition and Innovation |accessdate=March 25, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emphasis on [[ingroup]] unity in nihonjinron writings, and its popularization during Japan's period of military expansion at the turn of the 20th century, has led many Western critics to brand it a form of [[ethnic nationalism|ethnocentric nationalism]]. [[Karel van Wolferen]] echoes this assessment, noting that:

:In the nihonjinron perspective, Japanese limit their actions, do not claim 'rights' and always obey those placed above them, not because they have no other choice, but because it comes naturally to them. Japanese are portrayed as if born with a special quality of brain that makes them want to suppress their individual selves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Caron |first=Bruce |url=http://junana.com/CDP/corpus/GLOSSARY18.html |title=17 Nihonjinron |accessdate=March 25, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Origin ==

The NMI was started by the Effective Philanthropy Group at the [[Hewlett Foundation]] in 2006 with the goal that "by 2015, ten percent of individual philanthropic donations in the US (or $20 billion), would be influenced by meaningful, high-quality information about nonprofit organizations’ performance."&lt;ref name=guidestar/&gt;&lt;ref name=givewell/&gt;&lt;ref name=chronicle/&gt; Jacob Harold was the program officer responsible, and the Hewlett Foundation at the time was headed by [[Paul Brest]].

== Organizations funded ==

The NMI funded a number of [[charity evaluator]]s including:&lt;ref name=givewell/&gt;

* [[GiveWell]], that was focused on finding the very best charities to donate to&lt;ref name=givewell/&gt;
* [[Charity Navigator]]&lt;ref name=cn/&gt; and [[Guidestar]], that were focused more on rating large numbers of charities using clearly defined metrics
* [[Philanthropedia]], a platform for experts to rate charities
* [[GreatNonprofits]], a platform for people to share information about great charities

[[Holden Karnofsky]], co-founder and co-executive director of GiveWell, expressed gratitude to the NMI, saying that NMI's support of the organization was crucial in its first few years, when it was relatively unknown and the subject of unfavorable controversies. He also praised the NMI for their support despite differences in strategy and approach, and said that while the NMI often encouraged them to spread a wider net and collaborate more with other NMI grantees, they were never inappropriately pressured.&lt;ref name=givewell/&gt;

Ken Berger, President of [[Charity Navigator]], wrote a letter upon the closure of the NMI thanking the Hewlett Foundation for their generous support of Charity Navigator through their transition to version 3.0 of their product. Berger identified the Hewlett Foundation as the single biggest overall supporter of Charity Navigator.&lt;ref name=cn&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&amp;cpid=1734#.VmPejcoqRxU|title = President and CEO's Report for May 2014|date = May 6, 2014|accessdate = December 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Closure ==

In April 2014, an article the ''[[Chronicle of Philanthropy]]'' announced that the Hewlett Foundation was ending the Nonprofit Marketplace Initiative.&lt;ref name=chronicle/&gt; The Hewlett Foundation's decision was based on an internal re-evaluation of the project, motivated by two external pieces of information:&lt;ref name=chronicle/&gt;

* The Money For Good study conducted by Hope Consulting (paid for by the Hewlett Foundation) whose headline result was "few donors do research before they give, and those that do look to the nonprofit itself to provide simple information about efficiency and effectiveness."&lt;ref name=mfg&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.hopeconsulting.us/work/money-for-good|title = Money for Good|publisher = Hope Consulting|accessdate = December 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://blog.givewell.org/2010/07/20/the-money-for-good-study/|title = The Money for Good study|last = Hassenfeld|first = Elie|date = July 20, 2010|accessdate = December 5, 2015|publisher = [[GiveWell]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An external evaluation from Arabella Advisors whose results further convinced the Hewlett Foundation that their strategy was not working anywhere near as well as they hoped.&lt;ref name=hewlett-more&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.hewlett.org/blog/posts/more-our-decision-end-nonprofit-marketplace-initiative|title = More on Our Decision to End the Nonprofit Marketplace Initiative|last = Wickline|first = Heath|date = May 12, 2014|accessdate = December 6, 2015|publisher = [[Hewlett Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hewlett Foundation also had some significant personnel changes over the time period: Jacob Harold left the Hewlett Foundation for [[GuideStar]] and was replaced by Lindsay Louise, while [[Paul Brest]] was replaced by [[Larry Kramer (legal scholar)|Larry Kramer]] as President of the Hewlett Foundation. They said that these changes made it more logical for them to re-evaluate the strategy, but was not the reason for ending the program, since the external studies and evaluations that would lead to the program's cosure had been initiated under the previous staff.&lt;ref name=chronicle-more&gt;{{cite web|url = https://philanthropy.com/article/Hewlett-Foundation-Should-Be/153147|title = Hewlett Foundation Should Be More Open About Shuttered Program|last = Schambra|first = William|date = May 12, 2014|accessdate = December 6, 2015|publisher = ''[[Chronicle of Philanthropy]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hewlett-more/&gt;&lt;ref name=alliance&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.alliancemagazine.org/blog/interview-fay-twersky-hewlett-foundation/|title = Interview: Fay Twersky, Hewlett Foundation (£)|date = July 4, 2014|accessdate = December 6,  2015|publisher = ''Alliance magazine''|last = Hartnell|first = Caroline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hewlett Foundation also clarified that even though they had failed to met their own goals with the NMI, the organizations they funded, such as [[GiveWell]], [[Charity Navigator]], and [[GuideStar]], had done a great job at meeting ''those organization's'' goals.&lt;ref name=hewlett-more/&gt;

Responding to the closure decision, [[Holden Karnofsky]] of [[GiveWell]] wrote that while the decision to shut down the program may have been the right one, GiveWell did not agree with the stated reasons for closure. Karnofsky argued that GiveWell's money moved in the years to come would alone more than justify the grand total of 12 million dollars spent on the NMI.&lt;ref name=givewell/&gt; This would be validated in the years to come: in 2014, GiveWell moved $13.0 million to its top charities from donors ''excluding'' [[Good Ventures]], a multi-billion dollar foundation it works closely with.&lt;ref name=impact&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.givewell.org/about/impact|title = Evaluating GiveWell's impact|date = April 1, 2015|accessdate = December 6, 2015|publisher = [[GiveWell]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacob Harold, the program officer formerly responsible for NMI, who had since left for [[GuideStar]], responded to Karnofsky's post, noting that the NMI's goals of reaching a large population were still worthwhile, and that its main problem may have been that it was too early for its time. Harold noted that he hoped to make the vision the NMI sought a reality through his work for GuideStar. He emphasized the importance of both quality and quantity, noting that GiveWell and the [[effective altruism]] movement it was part of might be too neglectful of the quantity goals that the NMI had.&lt;ref name=guidestar/&gt;

'''Paul Horwich''' (born 1947) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[analytic philosophy|analytic philosopher]] at [[New York University]], noted for his contributions to [[philosophy of science]], [[philosophy of physics]], the philosophy of language (especially [[truth]], and meaning) and the interpretation of [[Wittgenstein]]'s later philosophy.  

==Education and career==

Horwich earned his PhD from [[Cornell University]], where his thesis advisor was [[Richard Boyd]] (title of the doctoral thesis: ''The Metric and Topology of Time''). He has previously taught at [[MIT]], [[University College London]], and [[CUNY Graduate Center]].&lt;ref&gt;http://philosophy.fas.nyu.edu/docs/IO/1515/CV-Horwich.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical work==

In ''Truth'' (1990), Horwich presented a detailed defence of the ''minimalistic'' variant of the [[deflationary theory of truth]].  He is opposed to appealing to reference and truth to explicate meaning, and so has defended a naturalistic ''use theory'' of meaning in his book ''Meaning''. Other concepts he has advanced are a probabilistic account of scientific methodology and a unified explanation of temporally asymmetric phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosophy.fas.nyu.edu/object/paulhorwich No 3rd party source for this]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of philosophical speculations about [[time travel]], Horwich coined the term autofanticide for a variant of the [[grandfather paradox]], in which a person goes back in time and deliberately or inadvertently kills his or her infant self.&lt;ref&gt;Asymmetries in Time: Problems in the Philosophy of Science, Paul Horwich, MIT Press, Jan 1, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a 1973 graduate of [[Allentown College]] and earned a [[PhD]] from the [[University of Virginia]].

He was executive editor of the quarterly journal ''[[Perspectives on Political Science]]'' and was a chairman of the politics and literature section of the [[American Political Science Association]]. He also served on the editorial board of the new bilingual critical edition of [[Alexis de Tocqueville]]'s ''[[Democracy in America]]''. Lawler also served on the editorial boards of several journals.{{which|date=November 2015}}

==Writing career==
He wrote or edited 15 books. His ''Modern and American Dignity'' was the reason he was chosen the 2010 Georgia Author of the Year. His books--''Postmodernism Rightly Understood'', ''Aliens in America'', ''Stuck with Virtue'', and ''Homeless and at Home in America''—have been widely and positively reviewed. His ''American Political Rhetoric'' (edited with Robert Schaefer, seventh edition) is used in introductory American government courses at a sizeable number {{quantify|date=November 2015}} of colleges and universities.{{which|date=November 2015}} He was the 2007 winner of the Weaver Prize for Scholarly Excellence in promoting human dignity to a broad audience.

Lawler has spoken at roughly a hundred American colleges and universities and published well over two hundred articles, chapters, and reviews in a wide variety of venues.{{which|date=November 2015}} Over the last year alone,{{Clarify timeframe|date=November 2018}} he gave nearly 30 lectures at various institutions and conferences.{{which|date=November 2015}} He was the 2015 Ross Lence Master Teacher at Residence at the Honors College at the [[University of Houston]].

Lawler wrote broadly from a [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] intellectual tradition that emphasizes the importance of limits on unfettered personal autonomy in shaping well-lived lives, as well as the centrality of the love of truth in making sense of the human experience and knowing "who we are and what we are supposed to do." Lawler argued that moral anthropology suggests the possibility of God's existence and love. His influences include both Catholics such as [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], [[Pierre Manent]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]], [[Flannery O'Connor]], [[Tocqueville]] and [[Walker Percy]], as well as non-Catholic thinkers (especially [[Leo Strauss]]).

In 2004, Lawler was appointed to President Bush's [[Council on Bioethics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Council Members List|url=http://bioethics.georgetown.edu/pcbe/about/lawler.html|work=Bioethics Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served until the council was terminated by President Obama in 2009.

In 2010, Lawler (with Marc Guerra of Assumption College) received a major grant from the Science of Virtues project at the University of Chicago for a series of path-breaking conferences at Berry College on the theme of "Stuck with Virtue". This conferences has generated several important publications, including ''A Political Companion to Walker Percy'' (edited with Brian Smith) and ''Descartes, Locke, Darwin, and the Science of Modern Virtue''.

Lawler  also became a popular and influential blogger,{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} at both "Rightly Understood" at ''Big Think'' and "Postmodern Conservative," originally at ''First Things'' and then at ''National Review Online''. His posts and short essays are often and widely reprinted.{{By whom|date=November 2015}} The first volume of his best short essays -- ''Allergic to Crazy''—has been published by St. Augustine's Press. And his ''American Heresies and Higher Education'' is forthcoming in 2016.

==Family==
He was the son of Patricia Ann Fullerton Lawler and Thomas Comerford Lawler, the nephew of Ronald David Lawler, [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|OFMCap]], and the brother of Thomas Aquin "Quin" Lawler and Gregory Francis Lawler.

His father worked for the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] from 1951 to 1977, and also worked in [[patristics]], serving as a co-editor, from 1964 to 1991, of the Ancient Christian Writers series  published first by Newman Press, and then by Paulist Press.  He likewise translated ''Saint Augustine:  Sermons for Christmas and Epiphany'', and ''The Letters of Saint Jerome'' for that series.  With his brother, Father Roland, and the future cardinal, [[Donald Wuerl]], he wrote an adult catechism, ''The Teaching of Christ''.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Sullivan, "Thomas Lawler Dies, Author and Editor of Catholic Catechism",  ''Washington Post'', Monday, November 28, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Metaphysics of Quality''' ('''MoQ''') is a [[theory]] of [[reality]] introduced in [[Robert M. Pirsig|Robert Pirsig]]'s [[philosophical fiction|philosophical novel]], ''[[Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance]]'' (1974) and expanded in ''[[Lila: An Inquiry into Morals]]'' (1991). The MoQ incorporates facets of [[Sophism]], [[East Asian philosophy]], [[pragmatism]], the work of [[F. S. C. Northrop]], and indigenous American philosophy. Pirsig argues that the MoQ is a better lens through which to view reality than the [[subject (philosophy)|subjective]]/[[object (philosophy)|objective]] mindset that Pirsig attributes to [[Aristotle]]. The book ''[[Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance]]'' references the Sanskrit doctrine of [[Tat Tvam Asi]] or "Thou art that" which asserts an existential monism as opposed to the subject–object dualism.&lt;ref&gt;Pirsig, Robert M. ''Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance: An inquiry into values''. Random House, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The Metaphysics of Quality originated with Pirsig's college studies as a [[biochemistry]] student at the [[University of Minnesota]].  He describes in ''Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance'' that as he studied, he found the number of rational hypotheses for any given phenomenon appeared to be unlimited. It seemed to him this would seriously undermine the validity of the scientific method. His studies began to suffer as he pondered the question and eventually he was expelled from the university.

After spending some time in Korea as a soldier, Pirsig concluded that Oriental [[philosophy]] was a better place to search for ultimate answers. On his return home from Korea, Pirsig read [[F. S. C. Northrop]]'s book ''The Meeting of East and West'' which related Western culture to the [[East Asian cultural sphere|culture of East Asia]] in a systematic way.  In 1950, Pirsig continued his philosophical studies at [[Banaras Hindu University]], where he came across the [[Sanskrit]] doctrine of ''[[Tat Tvam Asi]]''&amp;nbsp;—in his words, "Thou art that, which asserts that everything you think you are (Subjective), and everything you think you perceive (Objective), are undivided. To fully realize this lack of division is to become enlightened." The nature of mystical experience plays an underlying role throughout his work.

In the late 1950s, Pirsig taught [[rhetoric]] at [[Montana State University|Montana State College&amp;nbsp;– Bozeman]] and, with the encouragement of an older colleague, decided to explore what exactly was meant by the term ''[[Quality (philosophy)|quality]]''. He assigned his students the task of defining the word. This, coupled with a [[Native American Church]] [[peyote]] ceremony he attended with an anthropologist friend, [[James Verne Dusenberry]], led Pirsig into what he called "a mushroom cloud of thought."{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Pirsig began developing his ideas about quality in his first book, ''Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance'', and expanded and codified his ideas into the MoQ in ''Lila''.

"Quality," or "value," as described by Pirsig, cannot be defined because it [[empiricism|empirically]] precedes any intellectual construction of it, namely due to the fact that quality (as Pirsig explicitly defines it) exists always as a [[perceptual]] [[experience]] before it is ever thought of descriptively or academically. Quality is the "knife-edge" of experience, found only in the present, known or at least potentially accessible to all of "us" (cf. Plato's ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'', 258d). Equating it with the [[Tao]], Pirsig postulates that Quality is the fundamental force in the universe stimulating everything from atoms to animals to evolve and incorporate ever greater levels of Quality. According to the MoQ, everything (including [[idea]]s, and [[matter]]) is a product and a result of Quality.

=== Static quality patterns and dynamic quality ===
The MoQ maintains that quality itself is undefinable ([[Tao]]), but to better understand it, Pirsig breaks quality down into two ("knife-edge") forms: static quality patterns (patterned) and dynamic quality (unpatterned). The four patterns of static value as well as dynamic quality account exhaustively for all of ("knife-edged") reality. As the initial (cutting edge) dynamic quality becomes habituated, it turns into static patterns (viz. [[data]], expectations). It is important to note that Pirsig is not proposing a duality: quality is one, "every last bit of it", yet [[wikt:manifestation|manifests]] itself differently. Rather than dualism, this manifestation of quality in terms of dynamic and static aspects represents a [[dialectical monism]].

==== Dynamic quality ====
Dynamic quality cannot be defined.  It can only be understood intellectually through the use of analogy.  It can be described as the force of change in the universe; when an aspect of quality becomes habitual or customary, it becomes static. Pirsig calls dynamic quality "the pre-intellectual cutting edge of reality" because it can be recognized before it can be conceptualized. This is why the dynamic beauty of a piece of music can be recognized before a static analysis explaining why the music is beautiful can be constructed.

==== Static quality patterns ====
Pirsig defines static quality as everything which can be defined. Everything found in a dictionary, for instance, is static quality. These static forms, if they have enough high or low quality, are given names and are interchanged with other "people", building the base of knowledge for a culture. So some cultures divide between things other cultures perceive as equal (Pirsig gave as example the sounds of the Indian syllables "dha" and "da," which are absolutely equal to western ears), and some cultures haven't any words for a specific meaning at all (for example, Spanish has no word for "accountability"). Pirsig divides static quality into inorganic, biological, social, and intellectual patterns, in ascending order of morality. 
 
*[[Inorganic]] patterns: non-living things 
*[[biology|Biological]] patterns: living things 
*[[society|Social]] patterns: behaviors, habits, rituals, institutions. 
*[[Intellect]]ual patterns: ideas 
 
Pirsig describes [[evolution]] as the moral progression of these patterns of [[Value theory|value]]. For example, a biological pattern overcoming an inorganic pattern (e.g. bird flight which overcomes gravity) is a moral thing because a biological pattern is a higher form of evolution. Likewise, an intellectual pattern of value overcoming a social one (e.g. [[civil rights]]) is a moral development because [[intellect]] is a higher form of evolution than society. Therefore, decisions about one's conduct during any given day can be made using the Metaphysics of Quality.  It is important to note that Pirsig is not proposing criticism or responsibility, but acceptance, and pure absorption: &lt;blockquote&gt;"When he wrote it he felt momentary fright and was about to strike out the words "All of it. Every last bit of it." Madness there. I think he saw it. But he couldn’t see any logical reason to strike these words out and it was too late now for faintheartedness. He ignored his warning and let the words stand."-ZMM, Ch.20 &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Good is a noun. That was it. That was what Phaedrus had been looking for. That was the homer, over the fence, that ended the ball game. Good as a noun rather than as an adjective is all the Metaphysics of Quality is about. Of course, the ultimate Quality isn't a noun or an adjective or anything else definable, but if you had to reduce the whole Metaphysics of Quality to a single sentence, that would be it."-Lila, The End&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The language we've inherited confuses this. We say "my" body and "your" body and "his" body and "her" body, but it isn't that way. … This Cartesian "Me," this autonomous little [[homunculus]] who sits behind our eyeballs looking out through them in order to pass judgment on the affairs of the world, is just completely ridiculous. This self-appointed little editor of reality is just an impossible fiction that collapses the moment one examines it."-ZMM, Ch.15&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Another immoral way of killing the static patterns is to pass the patterns to someone else, in what Phaedrus called a 'karma dump.' ... If you take all this karmic garbage and make yourself feel better by passing it on to others that's normal. That's the way the world works. But if you manage to absorb it '''and not pass''' [editor's emboldening] it on, that's the highest moral conduct of all."-Lila, Ch.32&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2870">'''Salvator Tongiorgi''' (25 December 1820 – 12 November 1865) was an Italian [[Jesuit]] philosopher and theologian.

==Life==

Born in [[Rome]], Tongiorgi entered the [[Society of Jesus]] at the age of seventeen. After the usual noviceship, literary and philosophical studies, a half-decade was spent in teaching rhetoric at [[Reggio Emilia]] and humanities at [[Forlì]]. Then four years were passed in the study of theology, under professors such as  [[Giovanni Perrone]] and [[Carlo Passaglia]].

Immediately after this, in 1853, the young priest was assigned to the chair of philosophy in the [[Roman College]], and there during twelve years distinguished himself as a teacher and author. Within a few days of his forty-fourth birthday he was appointed assistant to the provincial of the Roman Province; but his health gave way before a year had elapsed.

==Works==

Tongiorgi wrote a well-known course of philosophy, ''Institutiones philosophicae'', which he published in three volumes at Rome in 1861 and at Brussels in 1862.&lt;ref&gt;Salvator Tongiorgi, ''Institutiones philosophicae'', https://archive.org/details/institutionesph01tonggoog&lt;/ref&gt; Nine editions appeared during the next eighteen years, some of them modified by [[Claudio Ranieri]]. A compendium of the same work and a separate volume on ethics also came from his pen. All his works were used as textbooks for college or seminary.

On some of the mooted questions in philosophy the author departed from the [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] tradition, rejecting the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]] theory of matter and form, denying the real distinction between accidents and substance, and claiming that mere resultants of mechanical and chemical forces could produce the life-activity seen in the vegetable world. These doctrines were not widely accepted; yet they stimulated [[neo-Scholasticism]] to make better use of the researches carried on in the physical sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fox|first=John Mortimer|title=Salvator Tongiorgi|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia_(1913)/Salvator_Tongiorgi|journal=Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)|volume=Volume 14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Note to anyone who is thinking of making this article self referential: Please do not do this, see the note at top of the recursion article for why --&gt;{{Selfref|For the self-reference template on Wikipedia, see [[Template:Selfref]].}}

[[Image:ouroboros.png|thumb|The [[Ouroboros]], a dragon that continually consumes itself, is used as a symbol for self-reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Soto-Andrade |first1=Jorge |last2=Jaramillo |first2=Sebastian |last3=Gutierrez |first3=Claudio |last4=Letelier |first4=Juan-Carlos |title=Ouroboros avatars: A mathematical exploration of Self-reference and Metabolic Closure |url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/titles/alife/0262297140chap115.pdf |publisher=MIT Press |accessdate=16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Self-reference''' occurs in [[natural language|natural]] or [[formal language|formal languages]] when a [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]], idea or [[formula]] refers to itself. The reference may be expressed either directly—through some intermediate sentence or formula—or by means of some [[Semantics encoding|encoding]]. In [[philosophy]], it also refers to the ability of a subject to speak of or refer to itself: to have the kind of thought expressed by the first person nominative singular pronoun, [[I (pronoun)|the word "I"]] in English.

Self-reference is studied and has applications in [[mathematics]], [[philosophy]], [[computer programming]], and [[linguistics]]. Self-referential statements are sometimes [[paradox]]ical, and can also be considered [[Recursion|recursive]].

==In logic, mathematics and computing ==
In classical [[philosophy]], [[paradoxes]] were created by self-referential concepts such as the [[omnipotence paradox]] of asking if it was possible for a being to exist so powerful that it could create a stone that it could not lift. The [[Epimenides paradox]], 'All Cretans are liars' when uttered by an ancient Greek Cretan was one of the first recorded versions. Contemporary philosophy sometimes employs the same technique to demonstrate that a supposed concept is meaningless or ill-defined.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In [[mathematics]] and [[computability theory]], self-reference (also known as [[Impredicativity]]) is the key concept in proving limitations of many systems. [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|Gödel's theorem]] uses it to show that no formal consistent system of mathematics can ever contain all possible mathematical truths, because it cannot prove some truths about its own structure. [[The halting problem]] equivalent, in computation theory, shows that there is always some task that a computer cannot perform, namely reasoning about itself. These proofs relate to a long tradition of mathematical paradoxes such as [[Russell's paradox]] and [[Berry's paradox]], and ultimately to classical philosophical paradoxes.

In [[game theory]] undefined behaviors can occur where two players must model each other's mental states and behaviors, leading to infinite regress.

In [[computer programming]], self-reference occurs in [[Reflection (computer science)|reflection]], where a program can read or modify its own instructions like any other data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Malenfant|first1=J.|last2=Demers|first2=F-N|title=A Tutorial on Behavioral Reflection and its Implementation|url=http://www2.parc.com/csl/groups/sda/projects/reflection96/docs/malenfant/malenfant.pdf|publisher=PARC|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous programming languages support reflection to some extent with varying degrees of expressiveness. Additionally, self-reference is seen in [[recursion]] (related to the mathematical [[recurrence relation]]) in [[functional programming]], where a code structure refers back to itself during computation.&lt;ref name="Drucker2008"&gt;{{cite book |last=Drucker |first=Thomas |title=Perspectives on the History of Mathematical Logic |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R70M4zsVgREC&amp;pg=PA110 |date=4 January 2008 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=978-0-8176-4768-1 |page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Taming' self-reference from potentially paradoxical concepts into well-behaved recursions has been one of the great successes of [[computer science]], and is now used routinely in, for example, writing [[compilers]] using the 'meta-language' [[ML (programming language)|ML]]. Using a compiler to compile itself is known as [[bootstrapping]]. [[Self-modifying code]] is possible to write (programs which operate on themselves), both with [[Assembly language|assembler]] and with functional languages such as [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], but is generally discouraged in real-world programming. Computing hardware makes fundamental use of self-reference in [[Flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flops]], the basic units of digital memory, which convert potentially paradoxical logical self-relations into memory by expanding their terms over time. Thinking in terms of self-reference is a pervasive part of programmer culture, with many programs and acronyms named self-referentially as a form of humor, such as [[GNU]] ('Gnu's not Unix') and [[PINE]] ('Pine is not Elm'). The [[GNU Hurd]] is named for a pair of mutually self-referential acronyms.

[[Tupper's self-referential formula]] is a mathematical curiosity which plots an image of its own formula.

== In life ==
The biology of [[self-replication]] is self-referential, as embodied by [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] replication mechanisms. Models of self-replication are found in the computational [[Game of life]], and have inspired engineering systems such as the [[RepRap]] self-replicating 3d printer.

== In art ==
Self-reference occurs in [[literature]] and [[film]] when an author refers to his or her own work in the context of the work itself. Examples include [[Cervantes]]'s ''[[Don Quixote]]'', [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', ''[[The Tempest]]'' and ''[[Twelfth Night]]'', [[Denis Diderot]]'s ''[[Jacques le fataliste et son maître]]'', [[Italo Calvino]]'s ''[[If on a winter's night a traveler]]'', many stories by [[Nikolai Gogol]], ''[[Lost in the Funhouse]]'' by [[John Barth]], [[Luigi Pirandello]]'s ''[[Six Characters in Search of an Author]]'' and [[Federico Fellini]]'s ''[[8½]]''. Perhaps the earliest example is in [[Homer]]'s [[Iliad]], where [[Helen of Troy]] laments: "for generations still unborn/we will live in song" (appearing in the song itself).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Homer |others=Translated by Robert Fagles |title=Iliad |year=1990 |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=1-101-15281-8 |page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-reference in art is closely related to the concepts of [[fourth wall|breaking the fourth wall]] and [[meta-reference]], which often involve self-reference. The short stories of [[Jorge Luis Borges]] play with self-reference and related paradoxes in many ways. [[Samuel Beckett]]'s [[Krapp's Last Tape]] consists entirely of the protagonist listening to and making recordings of himself, mostly about other recordings. During the 1990s and 2000s filmic self-reference was a popular part of the [[rubber reality]] movement, notably in [[Charlie Kaufman]]'s films [[Being John Malkovich]] and [[Adaptation (film)|Adaptation]], the latter pushing the concept arguably to its breaking point as it attempts to portray its own creation.

Various [[creation myths]] invoke self-reference to solve the problem of what created the creator. For example the [[Egyptian creation myth]] has a god swallowing his own semen to create himself. [[Ouroboros]] is a mythical dragon which eats itself.

The [[surrealist]] painter [[René Magritte]] is famous for his self-referential works. His painting ''[[The Treachery of Images]]'', includes the words "this is not a pipe", the truth of which depends entirely on whether the word ''ceci'' (in English, "this") refers to the pipe depicted&amp;mdash;or to the painting or the word or sentence itself.&lt;ref name="NöthBishara2007"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nöth |first1=Winfried |last2=Bishara |first2=Nina |title=Self-reference in the Media |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NBOFIdchEQYC&amp;pg=PA75 |year=2007 |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |isbn=978-3-11-019464-7 |page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[M.C. Escher]]'s art also contains many self-referential concepts such as hands drawing themselves.

== In language ==
A word that describes itself is called an ''[[autological word]]'' (or ''[[autological word|autonym]]''). This generally applies to adjectives, for example [[wikt:sesquipedalian|sesquipedalian]] (i.e. "sesquipedalian" is a sesquipedalian word), but can also apply to other parts of speech, such as [[wikt:TLA|TLA]], as a three-letter [[abbreviation]] for "[[three-letter abbreviation]]".

A sentence which inventories its own letters and punctuation marks is called an [[autogram]].

There is a special case of meta-sentence in which the content of the sentence in the metalanguage and the content of the sentence in the object language are the same. Such a sentence is referring to itself. However some meta-sentences of this type can lead to paradoxes. "This is a sentence." can be considered to be a self-referential meta-sentence which is obviously true. However "This sentence is false" is a meta-sentence which leads to a self-referential [[Liar paradox|paradox]]. Such sentences can lead to problems, for example, in law, where statements bringing laws into existence can contradict one another or themselves. [[Kurt Gödel]] claimed to have found such a paradox in the [[US constitution]] at his citizenship ceremony.

Self-reference occasionally occurs in the [[Broadcast media|media]] when it is required to write about itself, for example the [[BBC]] reporting on job cuts at the BBC. Notable encyclopedias may be required to feature articles about themselves, such as [[Wikipedia]]'s article on Wikipedia.

[[Fumblerules]] are a list of rules of good grammar and writing, demonstrated through sentences that violate those very rules, such as "Avoid cliches like the plague" and "Don't use no double negatives". The term was coined in a published list of such rules by [[William Safire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://alt-usage-english.org/humorousrules.html alt.usage.english.org's ''Humorous Rules for Writing'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first = William |last= Safire |authorlink=William Safire |publication-date=1979-11-04 |title=On Language; The Fumblerules of Grammar |periodical=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/04/archives/on-language-the-fumblerules-of-grammar.html?sq=Fumblerules&amp;scp=1&amp;st=p |page=SM4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In meta-disciplines ==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}
Several academic disciplines are sometime required to study themselves in forms of self-reference, for example [[historiography]] (or "[[meta-history]]") is history's study of its own past; [[meta-sociology]] occurs when sociologists study the power structures in their own academic institutions; and [[meta-mathematics]] is the study of mathematics itself as a formal system, using its own methods. In [[law]], self-reference may become an issue when laws are required to regulate the making of new laws, especially around [[constitutional]] issues. (The game of [[nomic]] begins as a model of this process.) The prefix "[[meta]]" is often used to denote this type of self-reference.

==In popular culture==
* [[Douglas Hofstadter]]'s books, especially ''[[Metamagical Themas]]'' and ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'', play with many self-referential concepts and were highly influential in bringing them into mainstream intellectual culture during the 1980s. [[Hofstadter's law]], which specifies that "It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law"&lt;ref&gt;[[Douglas Hofstadter|Hofstadter, Douglas]]. ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid]]''. 20th anniversary ed., 1999, p. 152. {{ISBN|0-465-02656-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an example of a self-referencing adage. Hofstadter also suggested the concept of a 'Reviews of this book', a book containing only reviews of itself, which has since been implemented using [[wiki|wikis]] and other technologies. Hofstadter's '[[strange loop]]' [[metaphysics]] attempts to map [[consciousness]] onto self-reference, but is a minority position in [[philosophy of mind]].
* The subgenre of "[[recursion|recursive]] [[science fiction]]" or [[metafiction]] is now so extensive that it has fostered a fan-maintained bibliography at the [[New England Science Fiction Association]]'s website; some of it is about [[science-fiction fandom]], some about science fiction and its authors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nesfa.org/Recursion/index.htm "Recursive Science Fiction"] New England Science Fiction Association website, last updated 3 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
===Austronesia===
{{See also|Aitu|Anito|Atua}}
The belief in soul dualism found throughout most [[Austronesian people|Austronesian]] [[shamanistic]] traditions. The reconstructed [[Proto-Austronesian]] word for the "body soul" is ''*nawa'' ("breath", "life", or "vital spirit"). It is located somewhere in the [[abdominal cavity]], often in the [[liver]] or the [[heart]] (Proto-Austronesian ''*qaCay'').&lt;ref name="tan"&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael L. |last=Tan |title=Revisiting Usog, Pasma, Kulam |publisher=University of the Philippines Press |year=2008 |isbn=9789715425704 |url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=EktzHrfup1UC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sather2018"&gt;{{cite book |author=Clifford Sather |editor=James J.

Its names are usually derived from Proto-Austronesian ''*qaNiCu'' ("ghost", "spirit [of the dead]"), which also apply to other non-human nature spirits. The "free soul" is also referred to in names that literally mean "twin" or "double", from Proto-Austronesian ''*duSa'' ("two").&lt;ref name="yu2000"&gt;{{cite book |first=Jose Vidamor B. |last=Yu |title=Inculturation of Filipino-Chinese Culture Mentality |volume=3 |publisher=Editrice Pontifica Universita Gregoriana |series=Interreligious and Intercultural Investigations |year =2000 |pages=148–149 |isbn=9788876528484 |url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=c4WqAOKb5c8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="duSa"&gt;{{cite dictionary |author1=Robert Blust |author2=Stephen Trussel |dictionary=Austronesian Comparative Dictionary |entry=*du |url=http://www.trussel2.com/acd/acd-s_d.htm#30339 |access-date=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A virtuous person is said to be one whose souls are in harmony with each other, while an evil person is one whose souls are in conflict.&lt;ref name="mercado1991"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Leonardo N. Mercado |year=1991 |title=Soul and Spirit in Filipino Thought |journal=Philippine Studies |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=287–302 |jstor=42633258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "free soul" is said to leave the body and journey to the [[Spirit world (spiritualism)|spirit world]] during sleep, [[trance|trance-like states]], [[delirium]], [[insanity]], and death. The duality is also seen in the healing traditions of Austronesian shamans, where illnesses are regarded as a "soul loss" and thus to heal the sick, one must "return" the "free soul" (which may have been stolen by an evil spirit or got lost in the spirit world) into the body. If the "free soul" can not be returned, the afflicted person dies or goes permanently insane.&lt;ref name="salazar"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zeus A. Salazar |year=2007 |title=Faith healing in the Philippines: An historical perspective |journal=Asian Studies |volume=43 |issue=2v |pages=1–15 |url=http://asj.upd.edu.ph/mediabox/archive/ASJ-43-02-2007/Faith%20Healing%20in%20the%20Philippines%20Zeus%20Salazar.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some ethnic groups, there can also be more than two souls. Like among the [[Tagbanwa people]], where a person is said to have six souls - the "free soul" (which is regarded as the "true" soul) and five secondary souls with various functions.&lt;ref name="tan"/&gt;

=== China ===
Traditional [[Chinese culture]] differentiates two [[Hun and po|''hun'' and ''po'']] spirits or souls, which correlate with [[yin and yang|''yang'' and ''yin'']] respectively. Within this soul dualism, every human has both an [[Non-physical entity|ethereal]] ''hun'' [[Wikt:魂|魂]] "spiritual soul; spirit; mood" that leaves the body after death and a substantive ''po'' [[Wikt:魄|魄]] "physical soul; spirit; vigor" that remains with the corpse. Chinese traditions differ over the number of ''hun'' and ''po'' souls in a person, for example, [[Daoism]] has the ''sanhunqipo'' 三魂七魄 "three ''hun'' and seven ''po''".

=== Inuit ===
Kalbo [[Inuit]] groups believe that a person has more than one type of soul. One is associated with respiration, the other can accompany the body as a shadow. Soul concepts of different Inuit groups are diverse; they are not alike.&lt;ref&gt;Kleivan &amp; Sonne (1985) pp.&amp;nbsp;17–18&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, it is connected to [[Shamanism among Eskimo peoples|shamanistic beliefs among the various Inuit groups]].&lt;ref&gt;Merkur (1985) pp.&amp;nbsp;61, 222–223, 226, 240&lt;/ref&gt; Also [[Caribou Inuit]] groups believed in several types of souls.&lt;ref&gt;Gabus (1970) p.&amp;nbsp;211&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ural ===
The concept of more kinds of souls can be found also at several [[Finno-Ugric peoples]].&lt;ref name="Hoppál 1975:225"/&gt;&lt;ref name=fodor2&gt;Fodor (2005) p.&amp;nbsp;16–17&lt;/ref&gt; See notion of shadow-soul (being able to depart freely the body), e.g. [[:hu:Íz (mitológia)|“íz”]] in [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] folk beliefs.&lt;ref name=fodor2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dienes (1975) p.&amp;nbsp;83&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of a dualistic shadow-soul called ''itse'', related to the Hungarian conception, is also part of [[Finnish folklore|Finnish]] and general [[Baltic-Finnic]] folklore. The [[Estonian people|Estonian]] soul concept has been approached by several authors, some of them using rather complex frameworks (online &lt;ref name=Kul-ConSl/&gt;).

[[File:Botero - Della ragion di stato, 1589 - 5870034.tif|right|thumb|''Della ragion di stato libri dieci''. Frontispiece to the first edition (Venezia: appresso i Gioliti) 1589]]
'''''The Reason of State''''' (Italian: '''''Della Ragion di Stato''''') is a work of political philosophy by Italian [[Jesuit]] [[Giovanni Botero]]. Reason of state denotes a way of thinking about government that emerges at the end of the fifteenth century and remains prevalent until the eighteenth century. It refers to the right of rulers to act in ways that go counter to the dictates of both [[natural law|natural]] and [[positive law]] with the aim of acquiring, preserving, and augmenting the dominion of the state. It was first published in [[Venice]] in 1589, and is most notable for criticizing methods of statecraft associated with [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] and presenting [[economics]] as an aspect of politics.

'''Walter Hubert Annenberg''' (March 13, 1908&amp;nbsp;– October 1, 2002) was an American businessman, investor, philanthropist, and diplomat. Annenberg owned and operated [[Triangle Publications]], which included ownership of ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', ''[[TV Guide]]'', the ''[[Daily Racing Form]]'' and ''[[Seventeen (American magazine)|Seventeen]]'' magazine. He was appointed by President [[Richard Nixon]] as [[United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom]], where he served from 1969 to 1974.

Annenberg was born in [[Milwaukee]] and raised in [[New York City|New York]]. He attended the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania|Wharton School]], the business school at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], though he dropped out to pursue stock investing. His father, [[Moses Annenberg]], was convicted of tax evasion and incarcerated for two years. During that time, and following his father's death in 1942, Annenberg took control of the ''Inquirer,'' expanding its influence and his own. He built up his family's magazine business with great success, extending it into parts of the media industry such as radio and television.

During his tenure as U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom, he developed a close friendship with [[Queen Elizabeth II]] and other members of the Royal family. After initial perceived missteps, he came to be admired for his dedicated work ethic, his wife's lavish entertaining, and personal gifts to support patriotic British causes, such as the restoration of [[St. Paul's Cathedral]] in London. He also paid for the renovation of [[Winfield House]], the American ambassador's residence.

In his later years, Annenberg became one of the most prominent philanthropists in the United States. He established the [[Annenberg Foundation]] in 1988 and personally gave over $2 billion to educational establishments and art galleries, including both the [[Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania]] and [[USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism]] in Los Angeles. At [[Sunnylands]], his 220-acre estate near [[Palm Springs, California]], he entertained royalty, presidents and other celebrities; it is now a museum and retreat center dedicated to furthering the Annenbergs' legacies.

==Early life==
Walter Annenberg was born to a [[Jewish]] family in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]], on March 13, 1908. He was the only son of Sadie Cecelia née Freedman (1879–1965) and [[Moses Annenberg|Moses "Moe" Louis Annenberg]], who published the ''[[Daily Racing Form]]'' and purchased ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.broadcastpioneers.com/inquirerhistory.html|title=The History of the Philadelphia Inquirer|accessdate=November 24, 2007|last=Wilkinson|first=Gerry|website=Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Annenberg was a [[Stuttering|stutterer]] since childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/02/arts/walter-annenberg-94-dies-philanthropist-and-publisher.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm |title=Walter Annenberg, 94, Dies; Philanthropist and Publisher|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |date=October 2, 2002 |accessdate=October 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20131016133658/http://pabook.libraries.psu.edu/palitmap/bios/Annenberg__Walter.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n0SujCRdh4gC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;lpg=PA66&amp;dq=walter+annenberg+stutter&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zic5rAZSrn&amp;sig=-RUNbU9TinUmlLNKa4P2YA3PVzc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QwNbUuOsO9TI4AOl4YDQCA&amp;ved=0CGIQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=walter%20annenberg%20stutter&amp;f=false |title=Legacy: A Biography of Moses and Walter Annenberg - Christopher Ogden - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=October 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/20093375?uid=3739832&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21102745748801] {{dead link|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastpioneers.com/walterannenberg.html |title=The Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia |website=Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia|date= |accessdate=October 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He had seven sisters, whose names were Diana Annenberg (1900–1905), Esther "Aye" Annenberg Simon Levee (1901–1992), [[Janet Annenberg Hooker]] (1904–1997), [[Enid A. Haupt|Enid Annenberg Haupt]] (1906–2005), Lita Annenberg Hazen (1909–1995), Evelyn Annenberg Jaffe Hall (1911–2005), and Harriet Beatrice Annenberg Ames Aronson (1914–1969).

The Annenberg family moved to [[Long Island, New York|Long Island]], New York, in 1920,&lt;ref name="mbc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/A/htmlA/annenbergwa/annenbergwa.htm|title= Walter Annenberg|accessdate=November 24, 2007 |last= Gunzerath|first= David|website=[[Museum of Broadcast Communications]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Walter attended high school at the [[Peddie School]] in [[Hightstown, New Jersey]], graduating in 1927.&lt;ref name="mbc"/&gt; He dropped out of the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]], never attaining a college degree.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Catherine M. [http://www.immigrantentrepreneurship.org/entry.php?rec=77 "Walter Annenberg."] In ''Immigrant Entrepreneurship: German-American Business Biographies, 1720 to the Present'', vol. 5, edited by R. Daniel Wadhwani. German Historical Institute. Last modified January 07, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; While in college, he was a member of [[Zeta Beta Tau]], a traditionally Jewish [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zbt.org/index.php?id=83&amp;page=Notable |title=Zeta Beta Tau Notable Alumni|accessdate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Annenberg was greatly affected by [[tax evasion]] charges and other scandals involving his father in the 1930s. A significant part of his adult life was dedicated to rehabilitating the family's name through philanthropy and public service.

==Business career==
After his father's death in 1942, Annenberg took over the family businesses, making successes out of some that had been failing. He bought additional print media as well as radio and television stations, resulting in great success. One of his most prominent successes was the creation of ''[[TV Guide]]'' in 1952, which he started against the advice of his financial advisors. He also created [[Seventeen (American magazine)|''Seventeen'']] magazine. During the 1970s, ''TV Guide'' was making a $600,000 to $1,000,000 profit per week.

While Annenberg ran his publishing empire as a business, he was not afraid to use it for his political purposes. One of his publications, ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', was influential in ridding [[Philadelphia]] of its largely corrupt city government in 1949. It campaigned for the [[Marshall Plan]] following [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Annenberg"&gt;{{cite book | last=Ogden  | first=Christopher | year=1999  | title=Legacy: A Biography of Moses and Walter Annenberg  | publisher=Little, Brown and Company  | location=New York  | isbn=0-316-63379-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Annenberg"/&gt;
and attacked [[McCarthyism]] in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="New York Times 1999-07-25"&gt;{{cite news | first=Richard N. | last=Smith | title=From Paperboy to Philanthropist | date=July 25, 1999 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/07/25/reviews/990725.25smit.html | newspaper =The New York Times |publisher=The New York Times Company| accessdate = January 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, Annenberg used ''The Inquirer'' to cast doubt on the candidacy of Democrat [[Milton Shapp]] for [[governor of Pennsylvania]]. Shapp was highly critical of the proposed merger of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] with the [[New York Central Railroad]] and was pushing the US [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] to prevent it from occurring. Annenberg, who was the biggest individual stockholder of the Pennsylvania Railroad, wanted to see the merger succeed (which it did) and he was frustrated with Shapp's opposition.&lt;ref&gt;

The next day, a five-column front page ''Inquirer'' headline read, "Shapp Denies Mental Institution Stay." Shapp and others have attributed his loss of the election to Annenberg's newspaper.&lt;ref name="Annenberg"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

==Philanthropy and later life==
Even while an active businessman, Annenberg had an interest in public service. In 1953 he became one of the founding trustees of [[Eisenhower Fellowships]]. After [[Richard M. Nixon]] was elected President, he appointed Annenberg as ambassador to the [[Court of St James's]] in the UK. In 1969, under pressure after the Shapp controversy, Annenberg sold ''The Inquirer'' and the ''[[Philadelphia Daily News]]'', which he bought in 1957, to [[Knight Ridder|Knight Newspapers]] for $55 million. After being appointed as ambassador, he became quite popular in Britain, being made an honorary Knight Commander of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (KBE) in 1976.&lt;ref name="times59740"&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times|articlename=British Awards for Bob Hope and Mr Rusk|section=Official Appointments and Notices|day_of_week=Saturday| date=26 June 1976|page_number=5|page_numbers=|issue=59740|column=A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Queen Elizabeth and prince Phillip visit Sunnylands.jpg|thumb|right|The Annenbergs with [[Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[Prince Philip]] at their home, [[Sunnylands]], in Rancho Mirage, CA, 1983]]

Annenberg led a lavish lifestyle. His [[Sunnylands]] winter estate in [[Rancho Mirage, California|Rancho Mirage]], California (near [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]]), hosted gatherings with such people as President [[Ronald Reagan]] and First Lady [[Nancy Reagan]], Queen [[Elizabeth II]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Bob Hope]], [[Bing Crosby]], [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], and the family of [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]]. Annenberg introduced President Reagan to British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], and the Reagans often celebrated [[New Year's Eve]] with the Annenbergs. President Ronald Reagan named Leonore Annenberg the [[United States Department of State|State Department]]'s [[Chief of Protocol of the United States|Chief of Protocol]] in early 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nomination of Leonore Annenberg To Have the Rank of Ambassador While Serving as Chief of Protocol for the White House|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=43365|website=The American Presidency Project|accessdate=July 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sunnylands covers {{convert|400|acre|km2|1}}, guard-gated on a {{convert|650|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} parcel surrounded by a stucco wall at the northwest corner of Frank Sinatra Drive and Bob Hope Drive; the property includes a golf course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Andrew |last=Rosenthal|title=Citizen Reagan Won't Be a Retiree|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE1D91338F931A35752C0A96F948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=print|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=January 2, 1989|accessdate=November 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The estate continues to be used for meetings and retreats by prominent people.

Annenberg established the [[Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania|Annenberg School for Communication]] at the University of Pennsylvania and the [[USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism|Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism]] at the [[University of Southern California]]. He became a champion of [[public television]], receiving many awards, including the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] from President Reagan in 1986,&lt;ref name="NNDB"/&gt; the Linus Pauling Medal for Humanitarianism{{Citation needed|date=February 2014|reason=No mention found}}, the 1988 Eisenhower Medal for Leadership and Service,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efworld.org/about-us/eisenhower-medal |title=Eisenhower Fellows|publisher=The Eisenhower Fellowships|accessdate=February 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; was made a Knight of the [[Order of St. Gregory the Great]] in 1998,&lt;ref name="NNDB"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/632/000024560|title=Walter Annenberg profile at|publisher=NNDB|accessdate=February 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was named an Officer of the French [[Legion of Honor]].&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who in the World'', 1978–1979&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=February 2014|reason=No mention findable in a wide search, including LA Times archive. Need corroboration of this offline source}}

In the early 1980s, Annenberg also founded the Annenberg Center for Health Sciences at Eisenhower in Rancho Mirage, California. In the mid-1980s, he established the Annenberg Fellowship to [[Eton College]], a one-year fellowship for one US graduating college senior (chosen from a rotating list of US universities including Duke, Harvard, Penn, Princeton, Yale, and others) to spend a year teaching and serving as a cultural ambassador to the famous British boys' school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/yalecollege/academics/fellowships/competitions/list/documents/AnnenbergFellowship2008.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, he established the [[Annenberg Foundation]], and 1993, created the Annenberg Challenge, a US$500 million, five-year reform effort and the largest single gift ever made to American public education. In 1993 he and his wife [[Leonore Annenberg|Leonore]] were awarded the [[National Medal of Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nea.gov/honors/medals/medalists_year.html#93 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130826194408/http://www.nea.gov/honors/medals/medalists_year.html#93 |date=August 26, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1995.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=April 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He sold [[Triangle Publications]] (''TV Guide'', ''Daily Racing Form'' and a few other publications) to Australian publishing magnate [[Rupert Murdoch]] in 1988 for $3 billion (a record media price at the time), announcing that he would devote his life to philanthropy.

During his lifetime, it is estimated that Annenberg donated over $2 billion. He once said that "education... holds civilization together".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/pubrel/trojan_family/winter02/annenberg.html|title=Winter 2002 – Trojan Family Magazine|publisher=Usc.edu|accessdate=2013-10-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819074839/http://www.usc.edu/dept/pubrel/trojan_family/winter02/annenberg.html|archivedate=August 19, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many school buildings, libraries, theaters, hospitals, and museums across the United States now bear his name. His collection of French [[impressionism|impressionist art]] was valued at approximately US$1 billion in 1991 and was donated to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City upon his death in 2002. In 1990, he donated $50 million to the [[United Negro College Fund]] which was the largest amount ever contributed to the organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liu.edu/cwis/cwp/library/african/2000/1990.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211134655/http://www.liu.edu/cwis/cwp/library/african/2000/1990.htm |date=February 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a member of the Founding Council of the [[Rothermere American Institute]] at [[Oxford University]], helping to raise funds for the Institute's building and library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Founding Council, The Rothermere American Institute|url=http://www.rai.ox.ac.uk/about/history/foundingcouncil|publisher=Rothermere American Institute|accessdate=2012-11-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121117021312/http://www.rai.ox.ac.uk/about/history/foundingcouncil|archivedate=November 17, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Annenberg was named [[Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia]]'s Person of the Year in 1983 and was inducted into the Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia Hall of Fame in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.broadcastpioneers.com/p-hall.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, he received the S. Roger Horchow Award for Greatest Public Service by a Private Citizen, one of the [[Jefferson Awards for Public Service]], given out annually by the [[American Institute for Public Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jeffersonawards.org/pastwinners/national|title=National Winners &amp;#124; public service awards|publisher=Jefferson Awards.org|accessdate=2013-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Annenberg Space for Photography, dedicated to both digital images and print photography, was opened in Los Angeles' [[Century City]] in 2009 by the Annenberg Foundation and its trustees. The first exhibit featured the work of [[John Baldessari]], [[Catherine Opie]], [[Douglas Kirkland]],  [[Julius Shulman]], [[Lauren Greenfield]], and [[Carolyn Cole]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==Personal life==
In 1939, Annenberg married Bernice Veronica Dunkelman. Bernice was raised in a Jewish family in Canada, the daughter of Canadian businessman David Dunkelman who was known for mass-producing low-cost suits and selling them at a single price of $14 at his chain of 65 retail stores.&lt;ref&gt;Ogden, Christopher (1999). [https://books.google.com/books?id=n0SujCRdh4gC&amp;pg=PA308&amp;lpg=PA308&amp;dq=Beldon+Katleman+jew&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zi9aow0Tvq&amp;sig=QC2QJQZwu4JV6PiPircszdYmlMI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KmfYUOHMKoea0QHT74HgBg&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=dunkelman&amp;f=false ''Legacy: A Biography of Moses and Walter Annenberg'']. p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt; They divorced in 1950 after eleven years together. While married, Dunkelman and Annenberg had two children: a daughter, [[Wallis Annenberg|Wallis]], and son, Roger. Roger committed suicide in 1962; to commemorate his death, [[Harvard University]], where Roger was a student at the time, now has a Roger Annenberg Hall named in his honor.

In 1951, Annenberg married [[Leonore Annenberg|Leonore "Lee" Cohn]]. Lee was a niece of [[Harry Cohn]], the founder and president of [[Columbia Pictures]]. Although of Jewish ethnicity, she was raised a [[Christian Scientist]] by her uncle's wife.

'''Water justice''' refers to the access of individuals to clean water. More specifically, the access of individuals to clean water for survival ([[Drinking water|drinking]], [[fishing]], etc.) and recreational purposes as a [[Human rights|human right]]. Water and sanitation for all provided in an equitable and sustainable way is central to global justice for poor women and men. Despite successive global declarations and efforts, hundreds of millions still suffer from lack of access. Simplistic portrayals of water and sanitation 'crises' have often led to misunderstandings on the nature of the problem and how to address it. The result has been a failure to centralize the needs and interests of the poor and marginalized within different solutions.

A simultaneous increase in demand and decreasing availability of water are leading to an intensification of competition and conflicts, worsening existing water-based inequalities. Globalization and climate change has favored some actors' access and control of water at the expense of others— threatening their water and food security.

Water justice promotes the regulation of corporations from polluting water, and impeding them from restricting access, in any way, to bodies of water that may provide clean water for drinking, fishing, leisure, etc. Water justice is often reached through [[activism]], [[social media]], [[outreach]]; through the law; through the pressure imposed by [[interest group]]s and [[Lobbying|lobbyists]] on elected officials; and by educating the public on the multifaceted importance of water justice.

The issue of water justice is considered a relatively recent one in human history: before the 19th century [[Industrial Revolution]], people lived more in harmony with their immediate environment. As [[Industrialisation|industrialization]] has spread around the globe, so the problem of contamination and diminishing access to water has spread with it. As Earth's population continues to grow, people are putting ever-increasing pressure on the planet's water resources. In a sense, the world's oceans, rivers, and other inland waters are being harmed by human activities.

Over the past few decades, the increase in population and advances made in technology have increased the relevance of water justice. Water pollution has many different causes and this is one of the reasons why it is a difficult problem to solve. [[Surface water]]s and [[groundwater]] are the two types of water resources that pollution affects the most. If pollution comes from a single location, it is known as [[point source pollution]]. A great deal of water pollution happens not from one single source but from many different scattered sources. This is called [[Nonpoint source pollution|non-point source]] pollution. Among the different sources of both point and non-point water contamination, [[nutrient]]s, [[Wastewater|waste water]], [[sewage]], [[chemical waste]], [[radioactive waste]], [[Oil spill|oil pollution]] and [[plastic]]s are the most common, for example.

== Legal acts ==
To prevent increased pollution, environmental damage, and to keep drinking water clean, various Legal acts have been signed into law.
* '''The Clean Water Act''': The [[Clean Water Act]] was signed into law in 1948 under the name Federal Water Pollution Control Act, with expanded recognition and amendments in 1972. Amendments included:
** Outlawing of any pollutant being released anywhere that would lead to large bodies of water.
** Regulation of pollutants entering bodies of water.
** Provided funding for sewage treatment plants.
** Empowered the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] with the authority to enforce water regulation rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/history-clean-water-act|title=History of the Clean Water Act|last=EPA,OA,OP,ORPM,RMD|first=US|website=www.epa.gov|language=en|accessdate=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The Ocean Dumping Act:''' The [[Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972|Ocean Dumping Act]] was signed into law in 1972 to prevent excess pollution from entering the ocean. The EPA has the authority to fine no more than $50,000 for each breach of permit. The act also allows for general research and EPA research into ridding the ocean of pollutant dumping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gc.noaa.gov/documents/gcil_crs_oda.pdf|title=Ocean Dumping Act: A Summary of the Law|last=|first=|date=|website=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|deadurl=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** '''Shore Protection Act (SPA):''' The Shore Protection Act comes from title IV of the Ocean Dumping Act. It forbids vessels from carrying waste within coastal waters without a permit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-shore-protection-act|title=Summary of the Shore Protection Act|last=EPA,OA,OP,ORPM,RMD|first=US|website=www.epa.gov|language=en|accessdate=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Right To Water:''' Also known as the [[Right to water|Human Right to Water and Sanitation]], it was established by the [[United Nations]] on July 28, 2010. It was added to international law when the UN recognized water and general sanitation as a basic human right. It requires states and nations to provide clean, accessible drinking water to their people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/human_right_to_water.shtml|title=International Decade for Action 'Water for Life' 2005–2015. Focus Areas: The human right to water and sanitation|website=www.un.org|language=EN|accessdate=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA):''' The [[Safe Drinking Water Act]] was put into law in 1974. It provides protection to water both above and below ground. In 1996, amendments were added requiring the EPA to assess risks and costs when creating standards for this law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-safe-drinking-water-act|title=Summary of the Safe Drinking Water Act|last=EPA,OA,OP,ORPM,RMD|first=US|website=www.epa.gov|language=en|accessdate=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Important figures and groups ==

The Water Justice movement is largely grassroots, with small groups of citizens taking the issue into their own hands by means of protesting, petitioning, fundraising, or donating items such as water filters in order to broaden access to clean water. Some well-known people have used their exposure to further the cause of water justice: [[Erin Brockovich]], media personality and environmental activist has spoken against [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]] officials' mishandling of the water crisis there.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rt.com/shows/americas-lawyer/370367-baby-powder-cancer-flint/&lt;/ref&gt; Actress [[Shailene Woodley]] was arrested at a [[Dakota Access Pipeline protests|Dakota Access Pipeline protest]], writing afterwards about her experience: "If you are a human who requires water to survive, then this issue directly involves you."&lt;ref&gt;http://time.com/4538557/shailene-woodley-arrest-pipeline/&lt;/ref&gt;

Another key player arguing to defend access to clean water in the [[Standing Rock Indian Reservation|Standing Rock protests]] is the Standing Rock [[Sioux]] Tribal Chairman, Dave Archambault II, who has spoken to the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|Human Rights Council]] at the U.N. in [[Geneva]] on behalf of his tribe. In a separate statement, Archambault thanked those who fought the pipeline "in the name of protecting our water."&lt;ref&gt;http://standwithstandingrock.net/standing-rock-sioux-tribes-statement-u-s-army-corps-engineers-decision-not-grant-easement/&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being for the most part grassroots, the Water Justice movement is global, and encompasses a wide array of diverse groups such as the Global Water Justice Movement, Friends of the Right to Water, the [[Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions]], [[Food &amp; Water Watch|Food and Water Watch]], and the [[Heinrich Böll Foundation]]. Groups such as these believe that water is part of the global commons, and thus argue against the privatization of water resources and give the state the responsibility of ensuring the right to water.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epsu.org/article/global-water-justice-movement-denounces-world-bank%E2%80%99s-strategy-promote-privatization-water&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bradford.ac.uk/social-sciences/peace-conflict-and-development/issue-11/PCD-Issue-11_Article_Water-Justice-Movement_Davidson-Naidoo-Harden.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contamination from human activity ==
[[Water pollution|Water contamination]] usually occurs through a series of two mechanisms: [[Point source pollution|point]] and [[Nonpoint source pollution|non-point sources]] of pollution. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), point source pollution is "any single identifiable source of '''[[pollution]]''' from which '''[[pollutant]]s''' are discharged, such as a pipe, ditch, ship or factory smokestack.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/kits/pollution/03pointsource.html|title=NOAA's National Ocean Service Education: Nonpoint Source Pollution|last=Administration|first=US Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric|website=oceanservice.noaa.gov|language=EN-US|accessdate=2017-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, among the most common examples of point source pollution, poor factory and sewage treatment appear high on the list; although not as frequent, but, nevertheless, equally—if not more—dangerous, [[oil spill]]s are another famous example of point source of pollution. On the other hand, non-point sources of pollution are those that may come from different sources, among which, poor and badly monitored agricultural activities can negatively affect the quality of any nearby sources of water.&lt;ref name="cdc.gov"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/other/agricultural/contamination.html|title=Water Contamination &amp;#124; Other Uses of Water &amp;#124; Healthy Water {{!}} CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|accessdate=2017-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Point sources of pollution ===
* '''Industrial products and wastes''': Many harmful chemicals are used widely in local business and industry. These can become drinking water pollutants if not well managed. The most common sources of such problems are:
** '''Local businesses''': Factories, industrial plants, and even small businesses such as gas stations and dry cleaners handle a variety of hazardous chemicals that need careful management. Spills and improper disposal of these chemicals or of industrial wastes can threaten ground water supplies.
** '''Leaking underground tanks and piping''': Petroleum products, chemicals, and wastes stored in underground storage tanks and pipes may end up in the ground water. Tanks and piping leak if they are constructed or installed improperly. Steel tanks and piping corrode with age. Tanks are often found on farms. The possibility of leaking tanks is great on old, abandoned farm sites. Farm tanks are exempt from the EPA rules for petroleum and chemical tanks.&lt;ref name="Contaminated Water"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/privatewells/human-health-and-contaminated-water|title=Human Health and Contaminated Water|author1=EPA,OW,OGWDW, US|website=www.epa.gov|language=en|accessdate=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** '''Landfills and waste dumps''': Modern landfills are designed to contain any leaking liquids, but floods can carry conaminants over the barriers. Older dumpsites may have a wide variety of pollutants that can seep into ground water.
* '''Household wastes''': Improper disposal of many common products can pollute ground water. These include cleaning solvents, used motor oil, paints, and paint thinners. Even soaps and detergents can harm drinking water. These are often a problem from faulty septic tanks and septic leaching fields.&lt;ref name="Contaminated Water" /&gt;
* '''Lead and copper''': Elevated concentrations of [[lead]] are rarely found in source water. Lead is commonly found in household plumbing materials. Homes built before 1986 are more likely to have lead pipes, fixtures, and solder. Lead can leach into water systems when these plumbing materials corrode. Your water’s [[acid]]ity or [[alkalinity]] (often measured as [[pH]]—the measure of acidity or alkalinity of a chemical solution, from 0-14. Anything neutral, for example, has a pH of 7. Acids have a pH less than 7, bases (alkaline) greater than 7.) greatly affects corrosion. Temperature and mineral content also affect how corrosive it is. Lead in drinking water can cause a variety of adverse health effects. Exposure to lead in drinking water can cause delays in physical and mental development in babies and children. Adults who drink this water over many years could develop kidney problems or high blood pressure.&lt;ref name="Contaminated Water" /&gt;
* '''Water treatment chemicals''': Improper handling or storage of water-well treatment chemicals (such as disinfectants or corrosion inhibitors) close to your well can cause problems.&lt;ref name="Contaminated Water" /&gt;

=== Non-point sources of pollution ===
Agricultural activities that cause non-point source pollution include:
* Poorly managed animal feeding operations
* [[Overgrazing]]
* Overworking the land (for example, plowing too often)
* Poorly managed and ineffective application of [[pesticide]]s, [[irrigation]] water, and [[fertilizer]].&lt;ref name="cdc.gov" /&gt;
* '''[[Bacteria]] and [[nitrate]]s''': These contaminants are found in human and animal wastes. Septic tanks or large numbers of farm animals can also cause bacterial and nitrate pollution. Both septic systems and animal manures must be carefully managed to prevent private well contamination.&lt;ref name="Contaminated Water" /&gt;
* '''Concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs)''': The number of [[Concentrated animal feeding operation|CAFOs]], often called “factory farms,” is growing. On these farms thousands of animals are raised in a small space. The large amounts of animal wastes/manures from these farms can threaten water supplies. Strict and careful manure management is needed to prevent pathogen and nutrient problems in private wells. Salts from high levels of manures can also pollute ground water.&lt;ref name="Contaminated Water" /&gt;
* '''Heavy metals''': Activities such as mining and construction can release large amounts of heavy metals into nearby ground water sources. Some older fruit orchards may contain high levels of [[arsenic]], once used as a pesticide. At high levels, these metals pose a health risk.&lt;ref name="Contaminated Water" /&gt;
* '''Fertilizers and pesticides''': Farmers use fertilizers and pesticides to promote growth and reduce insect damage. These products are also used on golf courses and suburban lawns and gardens. The chemicals in these products may end up in ground water. The extent of contamination depends on the types and amounts of chemicals used and how they are applied. Local environmental conditions (such as soil types, seasonal snow, and rainfall) also impact their contamination potential.&lt;ref name="Contaminated Water" /&gt; Groundwater will normally look clear and clean because the ground naturally filters out particulate matter. But, natural and human-induced chemicals can be found in groundwater. As groundwater flows through the ground, metals such as iron and manganese are dissolved and may later be found in high concentrations in the water. Industrial discharges, urban activities, agriculture, groundwater pumpage, and disposal of waste all can affect groundwater quality. Contaminants can be human-induced, as from leaking fuel tanks or toxic chemical spills. Pesticides and fertilizers applied to lawns and crops can accumulate and migrate to the water table. Leakage from septic tanks and/or waste-disposal sites also can introduce bacteria to the water, and pesticides and fertilizers that seep into farmed soil can eventually end up in water drawn from a well. Or, a well might have been placed in land that was once used for something like a garbage or chemical dump site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://water.usgs.gov/edu/groundwater-contaminants.html|title=Contaminants Found in Groundwater, USGS Water Science School|last=USGS|first=Howard Perlman,|website=water.usgs.gov|language=en|accessdate=2017-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polluted runoff is created by [[rain]]fall or [[snowmelt|snow-melt]] moving over and through the ground. As the runoff moves, it picks up and carries away natural and human-made pollutants, finally depositing them into watersheds via lakes, rivers, wetlands, coastal waters, and even our underground sources of drinking water.&lt;ref name="cdc.gov" /&gt; In 2002, in the National Water Quality Inventory report to U.S. Congress, the states reported that agricultural non-point source (NPS) pollution is the leading cause of river and stream impairment and the second leading cause of impairment in lakes, ponds, and reservoirs.&lt;ref name="cdc.gov" /&gt;

== Activism ==
When it comes to America alone, there has been much activity surrounding the issues of water in Standing Rock, ND and Flint, Michigan. When the issue arose of a pipeline being implemented on the [[Standing Rock Indian Reservation]] of North Dakota, residents began to take action almost immediately. When the pipeline was proposed in January 2016, the Sioux tribe released a petition that garnered almost half a million signatures within 3 months.&lt;ref name="Fusion"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fusion.net/story/372387/timeline-nodapl-protests-standing-rock/|title=A timeline of the year of resistance at Standing Rock|work=Fusion|access-date=2017-03-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This postponed the construction of the pipeline, but the action did not stop there. In July of the same year, the tribe attempted to sue the Army Corps of Engineers with the argument that it would harm the area's water supply. This only led the [[Energy Transfer Partners]] to file a counter lawsuit, saying that the group was hindering their work.&lt;ref name="Fusion" /&gt; 2016 presidential candidate  [[Jill Stein]] led movements against the construction, which included spray painting  a bulldozer with the phrase, "I approve this message".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.omaha.com/news/politics/in-omaha-jill-stein-defends-spray-painting-bulldozer-at-north/article_39bae5a9-d586-55bf-8bb6-f884a763029e.html|title=In Omaha, Jill Stein defends spray-painting bulldozer at North Dakota pipeline protest|last=writer|first=Robynn Tysver / World-Herald staff|work=Omaha.com|access-date=2017-03-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adding to the publication of the issue, actress [[Shailene Woodley]] was arrested for blocking the construction of the pipeline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2016/10/24/arrested_actor_shailene_woodley_why_do|title=Actor Shailene Woodley on Her Arrest, Strip Search and Dakota Access Pipeline Resistance|website=Democracy Now!|access-date=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debate on whether or not the pipeline will actually be built is still in progress.

The water crisis in [[Flint, Michigan]] has also led activists to focus on getting clean water to the people. After the 2014 decision to make the Flint River the primary water source of the town, residents quickly noticed the quality of their water declining.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bridgemi.com/truth-squad-companion/disaster-day-day-detailed-flint-crisis-timeline?gclid=CNWI6YfKvNICFdU7gQodqDkDmA|title=Disaster Day by Day: A detailed Flint crisis timeline|date=2016-02-04|access-date=2017-03-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] filed multiple lawsuits against the administration in Flint, saying that the levels of lead in the water is absurd, and demanded the pipes be replaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/flint-water-crisis/2017/01/09/activists-flint-water-tests/96342196/|title=Activists urge caution on Flint water despite improved tests|work=Detroit Free Press|access-date=2017-03-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has yet to happen, and the people of Flint continue to struggle for clean water.

== Related organizations and programs ==
Several state and national organizations and programs are dedicated to the access of safe water. The scope of these organizations are varied by their outreach (from focusing on a small county to working globally) and the aspects of water justice they are contributing to. Many of these organizations work within governmental systems while others work outside of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nesc.wvu.edu/links/DW_nat.cfm|title=Drinking Water National and State Organizations and Programs|website=www.nesc.wvu.edu|accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; These organizations have helped aid in the understanding and knowledge of water related issues, how they affect individuals and communities, and have found solutions to improve safe water access.

=== Categories of water justice organizations and programs ===

==== Education ====
The United States of America has some of the safest drinking water supplies in the world. Despite this, there are several cases and outbreaks of illnesses and related health issues due to contaminated water reported to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthyhomes/bytopic/water.html|title=CDC – Healthy Homes {{!}} Health Topics {{!}} Drinking Water Safety|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several organizations work to educate communities about proper water safety procedures and places emphasis on individuals and communities to understand where their water supply comes from.

==== Industry ====
Many water justice organizations work within industries related to community water to create safer water infrastructure. Many provide certification to certain professions to ensure work and product quality related to water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abccert.org/|title=Association of Boards of Certification|website=www.abccert.org|accessdate=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, many organizations have created groups for professions that deal with water infrastructure and safety. Some of these profession include public health professionals, engineers, and scientific researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nesc.wvu.edu/links/DW_nat.cfm|title=Drinking Water National and State Organizations and Programs|website=www.nesc.wvu.edu|accessdate=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Research ====
Several of these organizations also promote environmental and public health related research and aid in funding and education of these projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fwr.org/|title=FWR Home Page|last=Jones|first=Gordon|website=www.fwr.org|accessdate=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Governmental ====
Many organizations related to water justice work with or within the government to enact change in water policy and management. This can include city and state governments, to the federal government, to Tribal governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tribalclimateguide.uoregon.edu/climate-programs/national-tribal-environmental-council|title=National Tribal Environmental Council {{!}} Tribal Climate Change Guide|website=tribalclimateguide.uoregon.edu|accessdate=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William of Sherwood''' or '''William Sherwood''' ({{circa|lk=no|1200|1272}}), with numerous variant spellings,{{refn|group=n|Including '''William Shirwood''', '''William of Shyreswood''', and '''William of Shireswood'''.}} was a [[medieval]] [[English people|English]] [[scholastic philosopher]], [[logician]], and teacher. Little is known of his life, but he is thought to have studied in [[Paris]], was a master at [[Oxford]] in 1252, treasurer of [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] from 1254/1258 onwards, and a [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of [[Aylesbury]].

He was the author of two books which were an important influence on the development of [[scholastic logic]]: ''Introductiones in Logicam'' (Introduction to Logic), and ''[[Syncategorematic term|Syncategoremata]]''. These are the first known works to deal in a systematic way with what is now called [[supposition theory]], known in William's time as the ''logica moderna''.

==Life==
William was probably born in [[Nottinghamshire]], between 1200 and 1210. In common with many educated English men of that time, he may have studied at [[Oxford university]] or the [[University of Paris]], or both. There are examples in his logical work which suggest he was a master at Paris. (For example, ''No man lectures at Paris unless he is a smart person'' and ''Whatever runs has feet, the Seine runs, ergo the Seine has feet'').  Further evidence that he lectured in Paris is that those logicians who were influenced by his work also worked there, including [[Peter of Spain (author)|Peter of Spain]] ({{circa|lk=no|1245}}) and [[Lambert of Auxerre]] ({{circa|lk=no|1250}}).

He is thought to have become treasurer of [[Lincoln Cathedral]] some time in the 1250s. The treasurer was one of the four principal officers of the English cathedrals whose duty was to keep the treasures of the church – the gold and silver vessels, ornaments, relics, jewels, and altar cloths. He would have had a personal residence in the [[Cathedral close]], would have employed a deputy and a large staff, and therefore could be absent as long as he performed those duties that could not be delegated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Edwards, K. |title=The English Secular Cathedrals in the Middle Ages |publisher=Manchester |year=1949}}&lt;/ref&gt; He probably died there in or before 1272.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=E. J. |last=Ashworth |title=Sherwood, William of (d. in or before 1272) |work=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/25449 |access-date=2015-01-09 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/25449}} {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is mentioned by [[Roger Bacon]], who had also been a Master at Paris, as among "the more famous wise men of Christendom" one of whom named is [[Albertus Magnus]], another of whom is master William of Sherwood, "the treasurer of the church of Lincoln in England, who is much wiser than Albert".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-last=Bacon |author-first=Roger |chapter=Preface |title=Fr. Rogeri Bacon opera quædam hactenus inedita |editor-last=Brewer |editor-first=J.S. |volume=I |location=London |year=1859 |translator-last=Kretzmann |translator-first=Norman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ''Introduction to Logic''==
William's main work is a small logic manual titled ''Introductiones in logicam''. It survives in a single manuscript probably written in the late thirteenth century, headed ''Introductiones Magistri Guilli de Shyreswode in Logicam''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bibliothèque Nationale]], ''Codex Lat.'' 16617, formerly ''Codex Sorbonnensis'' 1797&lt;/ref&gt; It did not appear fully in print until 1937, in Grabman's Latin edition, and was not translated into English until 1966, by Kretzmann. No other works that are definitely by him have ever been printed.

The book consists of six chapters; five of these are expositions of Aristotle's main logical works, as follows:
{| class=wikitable
! Chapter !! Chapter title !! Corresponding work by [[Aristotle]]
|-
| align=center | 1 || Statements || ''[[De Interpretatione]]''
|-
| align=center | 2 || The Predicables || ''[[Categories (Aristotle)|Categories]]''
|-
| align=center | 3 || Syllogism || ''[[Prior Analytics]]''
|-
| align=center | 4 || Dialectical Reasoning || ''[[Topics (Aristotle)|Topics]]''
|-
| align=center | 5 || Properties of Terms || —
|-
| align=center | 6 || Sophistical Reasoning || ''[[Sophistical Refutations]]''
|-
|}
Chapter 5, "Properties of Terms", contains material that is not in Aristotle, but is a distinctively medieval development called [[Supposition theory]], which deals with the semantics of statements. The theory attempts to explain how the truth of simple sentences, expressed schematically, depend on how the terms "supposit" or ''stand for'' certain extra-linguistic items, and tries to address the problem of ''sentential forms'', like "I promise you a horse", which do not appear to fit the standard syllogistic forms.

In this chapter William introduces what was to become a standard division of supposition into ''material'', ''formal'', and ''personal''. In ''material supposition'', a term stands for itself, as when we say that "Socrates" is a name (note that medieval Latin did not use quotation marks as in modern English). In ''formal supposition'', the word signifies its meaning, as in ''man'' is a species. Formal supposition is similar to what is indicated in modern philosophical logic by italicising a common noun, as when we refer to the concept ''horse''.  Personal supposition is approximately the relation we now call "satisfied by", or "denotes", as in ''the term "man" denotes Socrates, Aristotle, etc.''.

He discusses a number of problem cases. For example, the sentence "every man sees a man" is true when there is a single man that every man sees (for example if "every man sees Socrates" is true). But the sentence is also true when every man sees a different man, or when some men see a single man (such as Socrates), other men see another man, and innumerable cases in between. This is called ''confused supposition''.  This instance of the [[problem of multiple generality]], is now thought to be insoluble using the fixed schema of Aristotle's semantics.

William's work spurred a development of logic in the thirteenth century under the general designation ''De Proprietibus Terminorum''. Those who engaged in this part of logic were called the ''Moderni'', or ''Terministae''. Its most detailed treatment is found in [[William of Ockham|Ockham]], and in the works of those who followed him.

==Legacy==
Now, William is perhaps best known for a mnemonic poem to help students remember the names of the [[validity (logic)|valid]] [[Syllogism#Types of syllogism|syllogistic forms]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Barbara celarent darii ferio baralipton&lt;br&gt;
Celantes dabitis fapesmo frisesomorum;&lt;br&gt;
Cesare campestres festino baroco; darapti&lt;br&gt;
Felapton disamis datisi bocardo ferison
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This verse might not have originated with him, but it is the oldest known surviving version.  [[Peter of Spain]] later gives an account of the verses which is more detailed, and also one which lacks mistakes in William's version.  According to Kretzmann, this strongly suggests their source is a single earlier version, now lost.
