Receiving [[credit (creative arts) |credit]] by way of acknowledgement rather than authorship indicates that the person or organization did not have a direct hand in producing the work in question, but may have contributed funding, criticism, or encouragement to the author(s). Various schemes exist for classifying acknowledgements; Cronin et al.&lt;ref name="Cronin"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cronin |first=Blaise |last2=McKenzie |first2=Gail |last3=Stiffler |first3=Michael |title=Patterns of acknowledgement |journal=[[Journal of Documentation|J.

# [[editing |editorial support]]
# [[presentation |presentational support]]
# [[technical support |instrumental/technical support]]
# conceptual support, or peer interactive communication (PIC)

Apart from [[citation]], which is not usually considered to be an acknowledgement, acknowledgement of conceptual support is widely considered to be the most important for identifying intellectual debt. Some acknowledgements of financial support, on the other hand, may simply be legal formalities imposed by the granting institution. Occasionally, bits of science humor can also be found in acknowledgements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20418">After nearly a century of endeavour and negotiation which had been led by the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]], a statutory [[Board of Architectural Education]] was formed under the [[Architects (Registration) Acts, 1931 to 1938|Architects (Registration) Act, 1931]]. For the purposes of constituting the Board of Architectural Education the Act included a list of [[Schools of Architecture, Architects (Registration) Act, 1931|Schools of Architecture]] in the United Kingdom. The statutory Board was abolished in the 1990s, and when the [[Architects Act 1997]] repealed the 1931 Act the statutory list of Schools of Architecture went with it.

The 1931 Act had come to be passed at the end of a century of development in educational provision and in the method of qualifying by examination. The 1997 Act was passed in the period after the [[United Kingdom]] had become one of the Member States of the [[European Economic Community]], later named the [[European Union]], an organization which, among other things, has required Member States to remove obstacles to the freedom of movement and establishment in respect of professional practice, employment, trade and business within the territories of the Union.

The method of qualifying by passing an examination which the RIBA had recognized as allowing exemption continued in the period when the 1931 Act was in force, and remained available under the later legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architecture.com/TheRIBA/AboutUs/Ourstructure/Constitution/CharterandByelaws.aspx  RIBA Charter and Byelaws]&lt;/ref&gt;

By a further development, from 2007 a Chartered Member of the RIBA may apply for the registration of a Chartered Practice in respect of a business providing architectural services and comprising one or more Chartered Members meeting criteria for, and operating in accordance with, a prescribed scheme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architecture.com/TheRIBA/AboutUs/Ourstructure/Constitution/CharterandByelaws.aspx  RIBA Chartered Practice]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources==

The historian will find some source material in the Archive which the RIBA has made accessible at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/v/vam-riba-collections administrative archive of RIBA at V&amp;A]&lt;/ref&gt; and in books, periodicals and other publications of the period which have been deposited and retained in the [[British Architectural Library]] (of the RIBA).&lt;ref&gt;[[British Architectural Library]] (of the RIBA)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Angela Mace and Robert Thorne ''The Royal Institute of British Architects: a guide to its archive and history'', Mansell Pub.,1986.&lt;/ref&gt;
Another contemporaneous source of information, upon which the following is largely based, is provided by two editions of the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|eleventh]] of 1910&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|eleventh]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the fourteenth of 1929.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|fourteenth]]&lt;/ref&gt; These editions contain articles which conveniently indicate how [[Test (assessment)|examination]], as a method of gaining recognition for the attainment of the specialist knowledge and skill required of a professional practitioner, had grown and had been thought of in the period leading up to the passing of the 1931 Act.

==19c Background==

The background to the developments in education and the method of attaining professional qualification had been the unprecedented development of industrial and commercial activity in the United Kingdom and other countries in the course of the nineteenth century. This, and the impact on the working and living conditions of the populations affected, had been making demands for the building of factories, warehouses, offices, educational establishments, hospitals, housing, places of recreation and entertainment and places for religious and other purposes. With that came demands upon architectural practitioners for designs for buildings of all kinds, qualities and standards, for the supervision of the construction of works, and in some cases for making planning schemes for area development or redevelopment, of greater or lesser extent; sometimes collaborating with other branches of the construction professions, notably [[Surveying|surveyors]], [[civil engineers]] and, as the period progressed, [[structural engineering|structural engineers]], and those engaged in
[[mechanical engineering]] and [[electrical engineering]]. The demand for architectural services, in respect of both traditional and newer materials and techniques, was coming from public bodies, commercial and industrial enterprises, private owners or investors, philanthropists, benefactors and others.
&lt;ref&gt;[[s:The Town Extension Plan|The Town Extension Plan]], 1912 Warburton lecture, delivered by [[Raymond Unwin]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Institutional arrangements : RIBA==

As a result, institutional arrangements for architectural education became increasingly systematic, in respect of examinations for formal qualifications, and making qualifications a condition for granting some other form of distinguishing style or title (such as Fellow, Associate or Licentiate of a professional body), or for the right or expectation to be able to practise as an [[architect]], on one's own account or as a partner or as an assistant in another's office.

A leading participant in the development of those institutional arrangements was the society which had been formed in London in the 1830s and had petitioned for, and in 1837 had been granted, a charter of incorporation. This society was later granted the name Royal Institute of British Architects, and is for convenience referred to as the RIBA.

==Qualifying examinations==

The index of the eleventh edition offers users very little more about architectural education than a few words in an article on Examinations generally, which was attributed in part to Paul George Konody, Art Critic of ''[[The Observer]]'' and the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', formerly Editor of ''[[The Artist and Journal of Home Culture]]'', author of ''the Art of [[Walter Crane]]''; ''[[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]], Life and Work''; etc. (so described at the page of Wikisource for Paul George Konody&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Author:Paul George Konody]]&lt;/ref&gt;) and in part to Arthur Watson, Secretary in the Academic Department of the [[University of London]]. It began with the paragraph:

:''The term 'examination' (i.e., inspecting, weighing and testing; from Latin ''examen'', the tongue of a balance) is used ''[in the article which followed]'' to denote a systematic test of knowledge, and of either special or general capacity or fitness, carried out under the authority of some public body.''

There followed eight sections beginning with History and ending with a critical appraisal headed ''The Object and Efficiency of Examinations, and their Indirect Effects''. The second section was on Professional Examinations, followed by others on School-leaving Examinations, mentioning the "accrediting" system in the United States started by the [[University of Michigan]] in 1871; Methods of Examination: Written, Oral, Thesis and Practical; Competitive Examinations; The Organization and Conduct of Examinations; and Marking, Classification and Errors of Detail.

==Perspective==

The section on History began as follows:

:''The oldest known system of examinations in history is that used by China for the selection of officers for the public service (c.1115 B.C.), and the periodic tests which they undergo after entry (c.2200). The abolition of this system was announced in 1906, and, as a partial substitute, it was decided to hold an annual examination in Peking of Chinese educated abroad.''

:''The majority of examinations in western countries are derived from the university examinations of the middle ages. The first universities of Europe consisted of corporations of teachers and of students analogous to the trade gilds and merchant gilds of the time. In the trade gilds there were apprentices, companions and masters. No one was admitted to mastership until he had served his apprenticeship, nor, as a rule, until he had shown that he could accomplish a piece of work to the satisfaction of the gild.''

:''The object of the universities was to teach; and to the three classes established by the gild correspond roughly to the scholar, the bachelor or pupil-teacher, and the master or doctor (two terms at first equivalent) who, having first served his apprenticeship and passed a definite technical test, had received permission to teach...''

After a survey of the development of examination practice in the universities of western Europe up to the early 20c., the next section of professional examinations began with the remark "University examinations for degrees having ceased to be used as technical tests of teaching capacity, new examinations have been devised for this purpose". For examinations in Medicine, the article referred the reader to the article on Medical Education, and this section concluded with a single paragraph headed Other Professions, stating that a system of professional examinations carried on by other professional bodies, in some cases with legal sanction, was developed in England during the nineteenth century; and, in a list of subjects described as "the most important" mentioned "architecture (Royal Institute of British Architects )", along with: [[accountancy]], [[actuary|actuarial work]], music, [[pharmacy]], [[plumbing]], [[surveying]], [[veterinary medicine]], technical subjects, e.g. [[cotton-spinning]], [[dyeing]], [[motor manufacturing]], commercial subjects, [[shorthand]] and [[engineering]] (civil, mechanical and electrical).

==As at 1929==

Publication of the fourteenth edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica in 1929 happened shortly before the Board of Architectural Education was constituted under the Act of 1931. In it there was an article three pages long on Architectural Education, attributed to [[Lionel Bailey Budden]], MA, ARIBA, Associate Professor of Architecture in the [[University of Liverpool]]. The opening sentence was:

:''Underlying the system of architectural education at present established in most Western countries is the assumption that architecture is one of the fine arts, and that the prime object of the training which the architect should receive is to equip him as a creative artist in building.''

That could be compared with the words of the charter which had been granted to the RIBA in 1837, in which the purpose of the Institute was described as:

:''... for the general advancement of Civil Architecture, and for promoting and facilitating the acquirement of the knowledge of the various arts and sciences connected therewith; it being an art esteemed and encouraged in all enlightened nations, as tending greatly to promote the domestic convenience of citizens, and the public improvement and embellishment of towns and cities...''

When the present supplemental charter was granted in 1971, part of the first charter was revoked but the words quoted were retained.

In the meantime Professor Budden's article of 1929 included the following:

:''... it is generally agreed that the study of architecture should be preceded by a [[liberal education]]. As one of the fine arts, historically associated with the arts of [[painting]] and [[sculpture]], and as the background of [[civilized society]], it demands both for its practice and its appreciation some measure of general culture. The tendency today'' [1929] ''is, therefore, for schools of architecture in Europe, the [[British Empire]] and [[United States|America]] to require from candidates for admission evidence of a broad non-technical education... Today architectural education in all countries is in the hands of practising teachers. Direct connection between the instruction given in the school and the experience of actual practice is thereby assured ...''

The article then considered: [[Italy]], [[France]], [[Great Britain]] and [[British Dominions|Dominions]], Other European Countries, United States, and [[Mexico]]. It mentioned that the largest school of architecture in England was that of the [[Architectural Association]] (London) and the next that of Liverpool University, and explained the part played by the RIBA:

:''From its foundation in 1835 the Royal Institute of British Architects has been the supreme controlling authority of the profession throughout the empire. At no time, however, has the RIBA itself undertaken the teaching of architecture. But by setting up, in the latter half of the last century [19c.], a centralized system of examinations when no professional tests existed in the country, it performed a notable service in raising the general level of professional knowledge. Through its board of architectural education it has now delegated to certain approved schools the task of qualifying candidates for admission to the institute, only maintaining its own centralized examinations for students not seeking entry through scholastic channels.''

Schools of architecture which were then recognized for exemption from the RIBA final examination (except in the subject of "Professional Practice") were named as:

:''[[Robert Gordon's College]]s, Aberdeen; [[Edinburgh College of Art]]; [[Royal College of Science and Technology|Royal Technical College, Glasgow]]; University of Liverpool; Architectural Association, London; [[University of London]]; [[University of Manchester]]; [[McGill University]], [[Montreal]]; and the [[University of Sydney]].''

Schools in certain institutions which were then recognized for exemption from the RIBA intermediate examination were named as:

:''[[Birmingham School of Art|School of Art, Birmingham]]; [[Royal West of England Academy]], Bristol; [[University of Cambridge]]; [[Bute Building|Technical College, Cardiff]]; [[Leeds College of Art]]s; [[Leicester College of Arts and Crafts]]; [[University of North London|Northern Polytechnic]], London; [[Colleges of Durham University#Colleges in Newcastle|Armstrong College]], [[Newcastle-on-Tyne]]; [[University of Sheffield]]; [[Birmingham School of Art|Municipal School of Arts and Crafts]], [[Southend-on-Sea]]; [[University of Toronto]]; and [[Sir J. J. School of Art]], [[Mumbai|Bombay]].''

It was mentioned that in both classes the maintenance of the requisite standard was assured by the periodic inspection of the visiting board, appointed by the RIBA board of architectural education, which reported to the institute on the work of the various schools granted or applying for exemption.

The system continued after the statutory Board of Architectural Education had been constituted, in connection with the provision in the Architects (Registration) Act, 1931 making it the duty of the Board to recommend "the recognition of any examinations in architecture the passing of which ought, in the opinion of the Board, to qualify persons for registration" under the Act (subsection 5(2)(a)).

Consonant with Professor Budden's remarks at that time, the objects of the RIBA are declared in its charter to be:

:''The advancement of architecture and the promotion of the acquirement of the knowledge of the [[Arts]] and [[Sciences]] connected therewith'';

and the next paragraph in the charter expresses the power of the RIBA to grant [[diplomas]], [[Academic certificate|certificates]] or other forms of recognition.

==Later developments==

The former division of the membership of the RIBA into the two classes of Fellows and Associates ceased under the supplemental charter and byelaws of 1971, but the method of qualifying by passing an examination which the RIBA has recognized as allowing exemption remains available. To be eligible for election to the now undivided class of Chartered Members a candidate is still required to have undertaken courses of study and passed examinations which have been prescribed or recognized by the Council, or to be able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Council having had a proper training in architecture.

As the field in which architecture is practised has continued to change, so has the RIBA Chartered Membership been keeping pace. In recent years a [[Byelaw]] was introduced to the effect that practising members are responsible for undertaking continuing professional development, defined in the Byelaws as:

:''The systematic improvement and broadening of knowledge and skill and the development of personal qualities necessary for the execution of professional and technical duties in the course of a Chartered Member's working life.''

A further and more recent development has been the passing of a Byelaw allowing a Chartered Member to apply for the registration of a Chartered Practice, defined in the Byelaws as:

:''a formally-established business providing architectural services and comprising one or more Chartered Members which meets criteria for, and operates in accordance with, a scheme prescribed by the Council, or a board to which the Council has devolved responsibility.''

==Further information==

Professor Budden's article in the fourteenth edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica (1929) was published shortly before the passing of the Architects (Registration) Act, 1931 of the [[Architects (Registration) Acts, 1931 to 1938]]. His School, Liverpool, was one of those listed in the Act for the purpose of constituting the statutory [[Board of Architectural Education]]. When he contributed the article he was Associate Professor in Architecture in the Liverpool University School of Architecture, becoming Roscoe Professor from 1933. He retired in 1952. He had entered the School in 1905, graduated BA in 1909 and MA in 1910, teaching there from 1911 and becoming Associate Professor in 1924. He had been University of Liverpool travelling Scholar in Architecture in 1909, and a student at the British School at Athens 1909-1912. He was first an Associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects (ARIBA), later becoming a Fellow (FRIBA). His architectural work included extensions to Liverpool University Students’ Union.

For further details of the development, in that period, of the policy of the RIBA for architectural education and qualification see  'Statutory Registration – chronology of key events' in [[Architects Registration in the United Kingdom]], and for opposition to the system of registration which was proposed and promoted by successive Bills in Parliament see [[William H. White (architect)|William H. White]],  [[Thomas Graham Jackson]]  and [[John Alfred Gotch]].

The candidates' [[personality psychology|personality]] and [[aptitude]]s are determined by techniques including [[interview]]s, group exercises, presentations, [[Test (assessment)|examination]]s and [[psychometric testing]].

An early example of assessment is the story of [[Gideon]] selecting the most suitable Israelite warriors:&lt;ref name=Prep&gt;{{citation |title=A Preparation Guide for the Assessment Center Method |author=Tina Lewis Rowe |publisher=Charles C Thomas Publisher |year=2013 |isbn=9780398087524 |page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|Then the Lord said to Gideon, “The people are still too many; bring them down to the water and I will test them for you there. Therefore it shall be that he of whom I say to you, ‘This one shall go with you,’ he shall go with you; but everyone of whom I say to you, ‘This one shall not go with you,’ he shall not go.”  So he brought the people down to the water. And the Lord said to Gideon, “You shall separate everyone who laps the water with his tongue as a dog laps, as well as everyone who kneels to drink.”  Now the number of those who lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was 300 men; but all the rest of the people kneeled to drink water.  The Lord said to Gideon, "I will deliver you with the 300 men who lapped and will give the Midianites into your hands; so let all the other people go, each man to his home."|{{bibleref2|Judges|7:4–7|NASB}}}}

In modern times, the [[German army]] introduced assessment techniques for selecting its officers in the 1930s.  Psychologist [[:de:Max Simoneit|Max Simoneit]] was appointed to head the army's laboratory and introduced leadership tests.  These were terminated in 1941 after too many favoured candidates had failed them.&lt;ref name=Prep/&gt;

Assessment centres were created in [[World War II]] to select [[officer (armed forces)|officer]]s and are still commonly used in military recruitment today.  Examples include the [[Admiralty Interview Board]] of the [[Royal Navy]] and the [[Army Officer Selection Board|War Office Selection Board]] of the [[British Army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wWyrlcyQLyUC&amp;pg=PA3 |title=Assessment and development centres |author=Iain Ballantyne, Nigel Povah |chapter=What is an Assessment Centre? |publisher=Gower Publishing |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-566-08599-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After World War 2, The OSS type of assessment center was essentially abandoned in The United States except for some internal use in intelligence gathering operations by the CIA. The British Civil Service Selection Board and Australians identified participants still used it for selection on their military college. Also, south Africans used the technique to identify supervisors in gold mines.
 
Assessment centers specifically applied for industrial usage can be traced back to the early 1950s and the pioneering work of Robert K Greenleaf and Douglas W. Bray of the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T). Douglas W. Bray as a director of human resources at AT&amp;T, directed a study that lasted over 20 years and followed the careers of young business managers as they progressed up the telephone company rankings. This study showed that the assessment center method could successfully predict organizational achievement and was later implemented throughout  AT&amp;T and later on adopted by many other companies: IBM, Standard Oil (Ohio) and Sears for example.

In 1975, the first guidelines on the use of assessment centers was created as a statement of the considerations believed to be most important for all users of the assessment center method. The guidelines ensure the integrity of the process, the validity of the data, qualifications of assessors, and the rights of the participants. The guidelines have since been revised several times to reflect current legality issues, global insights, and technological advances in the field. The most current version of the Guidelines and Ethical Considerations for Assessment Center Operations was endorsed by the 38th International Congress on Assessment Methods in Alexandria, Virginia in October 2014.
Today, The ACM is used by organizations all over the world in both private and public sectors to better select of employees and identifying their development in different areas. &lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.assessmentcenters.org/Assessmentcenters/media/2014/2014-Final-Presentations/International-AC-Guidelines-6th-Edition-2014.pdf|title=History of guidelines |author=Deborah E. Rupp, Brian J. Hoffman |chapter=History |publisher=Education and Praeger Publishers |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-566-08599-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[AT&amp;T]] created a building for recruitment of staff in the 1950s.  This was called '''The Assessment Centre''' and was influential on subsequent [[personnel]] methods in other businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1JohpKEWvnYC&amp;pg=PT6 |title=Managing Assessment Centres |author=John Sponton, Stewart Wright | chapter=What is an assessment centre? |publisher=Pocketbooks |year=2009 |isbn=978-1-906610-05-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other companies use this method to recruit for their graduate programmes by assessing the personality and intellect of potential employees who have recently graduated from university and have nil or limited work history. The [[Big Four (audit firms)|big four accountancy firms]] conduct assessment centre days to recruit their trainees. 68% of employers in the UK and USA now use some form of assessment centre as part of their recruitment/promotion process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assessmentcentrehq.com|title=Assessment Centre HQ|work=Assessment Centre HQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years companies have been set up to support assessment centre coaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.graduateassessment.co.uk/index.html |title=Graduate Assessment}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.assessmentcentrehq.com/assessment-centre-overview/ |title=What to expect at your assessment centre: A step-by-step guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
Assessment center is not just a building for assessing a job candidate. it is a process of evaluation of behaviour based on multiple evaluation including: job related simulations, interviews and/or psychological test 

The ultimate reason for having an assessment centre in any organization is to gather all relevant information under a standardized conditions about an individual’s capabilities to perform a given task. Assessment centers are often the method of choice for selecting senior leaders in government and municipal jobs, including police chief and fire captains.

During the process of assessing candidates, series of exercises that are designed to simulate the condition of a given job are given to the candidate to do. This help the assessor to determined if the candidate possesses the necessary skill and behaviour needed for the job.

The assessment center method provides a sort of wide-ranging, multidimensional assessment that has a strong record of both research significance and practical effectiveness to be accepted by participants and decision-makers alike. 
In essence, the purpose of assessment centre is to examine the skills and psychological state of an individual in order to determine his or her performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.hr.guide.com/data/g318.htm |title=Purpose of the assessment centres |author=hrmaster|chapter=Purpose|publisher=hr-guide.com|year=2000 |isbn=978-0-566-08599-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="757">In the 18th and 19th centuries, a '''bear-leader''' was a [[colloquialism]] for a man who escorted young men of rank or wealth on their travels, such as young [[gentlemen]] on the [[Grand Tour]].  The role of bear-leader blended elements of [[tutor]], [[Legal guardian|guardian]], [[Chaperone (social)|chaperon]] and companion.  A late example in literature can be seen in the ambitious Oxford tutor hired to keep an increasingly alcoholic young man out of harm's way – and out of the way – in ''[[Brideshead Revisited]]''.

== Plot ==
Still mystified by his son's death, the father ([[Jo Sung-ha]]) of high school student Ki-tae ([[Lee Je-hoon]]) tries to track down his two best friends, classmates Hee-joon ([[Park Jung-min (actor)|Park Jung-min]]) and Dong-yoon ([[Seo Jun-young]]), to try to find an explanation. Through Ki-tae's classmate Jae-ho, the father meets Hee-joon, who says he cannot help as he moved schools "weeks before what happened to Ki-tae." Afterwards, Hee-joon berates Jae-ho for giving his phone number to Ki-tae's father but Jae-ho tells him that Ki-tae "went crazy" after he moved away. Hee-joon manages to trace Dong-yoon and urges him to contact Ki-tae's father and provide some answers. In parallel, flashbacks to the time gradually reveal what really happened, starting with Ki-tae's needling and bullying of Hee-joon and the latter's response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Elley|first=Derek|title=Bleak Night|url=http://www.filmbiz.asia/reviews/bleak-night|accessdate=2012-11-18|work=[[Film Business Asia]]|date=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cho|first=Jae-eun|title=No easy answers in complex portrait of teen angst|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2933888|accessdate=2012-11-18|work=[[Korea JoongAng Daily]]|date=25 March 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130127072359/http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2933888|archivedate=27 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Young|first=Neil|title=Bleak Night: Film Review|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/bleak-night-film-review-99747|accessdate=2012-11-18|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=15 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students who are awarded the CPE upon successful completion of [[Primary education in Mauritius|primary school]] may advance onto secondary colleges, where they may begin lower [[Secondary education in Mauritius|secondary education]]. The highest achieving students generally progress onto national colleges. Lower secondary education concludes with the awarding of the [[Form III Certificate]]. Students who fail the CPE exams are allowed one single opportunity to re-sit the exams. 

If students fail the CPE exams, or have not received the CPE by age 13, they may then progress onto the [[Pre-vocational Certificate]]. As education is compulsory until age 16, this allows those who were not able to complete their studies in the academic stream to transition onto the [[Vocational education in Mauritius|vocational stream]] and continue their formal education.

== Early life ==

Born in [[Croton Falls, New York]], Hecht has lived in New York, the Philippines, Wisconsin, Washington DC, Virginia, Illinois, California, and Vermont. 

== Musical career ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}
Hecht began playing [[classical guitar]] in 1965, studying under John Mavreas at the North Shore Conservatory in [[Winnetka, Illinois]], and James Yoghourtjian at the [[Wisconsin College Conservatory of Music|Wisconsin College Conservatory]].  After studying music theory and composition at the University of Wisconsin, he played acoustic 6 and 12 string guitar and published three records: "Guitar" (1973), "Fireheart-Fireriver" (1977), released on Dragon's Egg Records, and "Willow" (1980), released on [[Windham Hill Records|Windham Hill]]. “Willow” was also released in Europe, and Hecht’s individual compositions appear on compilation albums and videos.  He performed over 300 concerts throughout the United States, Europe, and China, both solo and with other musicians including Alex deGrassi, Michael Hedges, George Winston, Jonathan Winter, and John Fahey.  Significant venues include Carnegie Recital Hall (1969 and 1982), Great American Music Hall, Shanghai Conservatory, Beijing Conservatory, Faneuil Hall, and others.

== Organizational development ==
Hecht is also an organizational development consultant active in the arts, environmental technology, and social services.  He served as board president of the Pyralisk Arts Center, in [[Montpelier, Vermont]], from 1990 to 2003; he then served as executive director of Vermont Environmental Consortium (VEC), a statewide association of environmental science and technology firms, educational institutions, public agencies, and non-profit organizations based at Norwich University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://vprarchive.vpr.net/vpr-news/interview-daniel-hecht-vermont-environmental-consortium/|title=Interview: Daniel Hecht, Vermont Environmental Consortium|last=Wertlieb|first=Mitch|date=2005-12-08|work=VPR News|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As director of VEC, he was commissioned by the [[Vermont Agency of Agriculture Food and Markets|Vermont Agency of Agriculture]] to produce "The Farm Energy Handbook," which he edited and co-wrote with 20 renewable energy and energy efficiency/conservation experts.  He also produced and scripted "The Green Makeover Video," a 45-minute video showing small businesses how to implement energy-efficiency and other green business practices, in collaboration with the Vermont Department of Public Service, Vermont Small Business Development Center, [[Efficiency Vermont]], and other partners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.vt.us/psb/EEU]{{dead link|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His weekly column, "The Green Grapevine," featuring profiles of Vermont green enterprises and current issues and developments in emerging green technologies, ran in five Vermont daily newspapers in 2006 - 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greaterdemocracy.org/archives/date/2008/03]{{dead link|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2008 to 2011, he procured funding for and served as project manager for a study of Vermont's potential to produce energy from post-consumer food waste, funded by a $600,000 grant from the [[United States Department of Energy|US Department of Energy.]]  Conducted in partnership with Central Vermont Solid Waste Management District and [[Vermont Technical College]], the study led to the construction in 2013 of a $3.5 million food-waste and manure biodigester sited at Vermont Tech campus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vttechcouncil.org/partners]{{dead link|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For two years, starting in 2010, he directed Reach Service Exchange Network, a $1 million pilot program, funded by the [[Administration on Aging|US Administration on Aging]], to deliver services to seniors and people with disabilities through a mutual exchange system.

== Post-secondary educational activities ==
Hecht has taught literature and writing courses at the [[University of Iowa]], [[Community College of Vermont]], and [[Johnson State College]].  Since 2010, he has been a faculty member in the Professional Writing Program at [[Champlain College]], in Burlington, Vermont, teaching Advanced Fiction Writing, Grant Writing, and Creative Writing.

The Republic of [[Austria]] has a free and [[private education|public school system]], and nine years of education are mandatory. Schools offer a series of [[vocational education|vocational-technical]] and university preparatory tracks involving one to four additional years of education beyond the minimum mandatory level. The legal basis for primary and secondary '''education in Austria''' is the School Act of 1962. But in 1963 it went back to the way it was. But again In 1999 it finally changed again. {{clarify |date=October 2016 |reason=Changes unclear}}
The federal Ministry of Education is responsible for funding and supervising primary, secondary, and, since 2000, also tertiary education. Primary and secondary education is administered on the [[States of Austria|state]] level by the authorities of the respective states.

Federal legislation played a prominent role in the education system, and laws dealing with education effectively have a de facto constitutional status because, like Austrian constitutional law, they can only be passed or amended  by a [[two-thirds majority]] in [[Federal Assembly of Austria|parliament]].

== General education ==
{{See also|List of schools in Austria}}
It is mandatory for pupils in Austria to complete nine years of school, four years in elementary school (Volksschule) and four years in a school for lower secondary education (Hauptschule/ Neue Mittelschule) or grammar school (Gymnasium). Students who want to do an apprenticeship additionally need to go to a polytechnic institute (Polytechnische Schule) for a year. After finding an apprentice position they have to attend vocational school (Berufsschule) for three years: this can be done either in block release (5 days a week for about four months) or day release (once a week in the same stretch of time as a normal school). On the days you are at school you don't have to go to work. At the end of those three years they have to take an exam, the final apprenticeship examination (Lehrabschlussprüfung).

Pupils who want to get a degree have to complete four to five years at an institution of higher education (Höhere Schule) or a vocational school with higher education entrance qualification (Berufsbildende Höhere Schule). Most of these schools require an entrance exam or demand high marks on your last school certificate. The final exam for either one of those higher education institutions is the matriculation (Matura). After that you are free to go to university, though some subjects may require additional exams (e.g. medicine).

==Private schools==
[[Private school]]s that provide [[primary education|primary]] and [[secondary education]] and some teacher training are run mainly, but by no means exclusively, by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and account for approximately 10% of the 6,800 schools and 120,000 teachers. Roman Catholic schools have a reputation for more discipline and rigor than public institutions, and some are considered elite institutions. Because there is no tradition of private university education in Austria, the state has a virtual monopoly on higher education. This has been changing slowly in recent years as private universities become more commonplace.

==History==
Before 1774, education in Austria was a task of the church: [[convent school]]s were therefore the only educational establishments, and school fees were charged. This is why education was only accessible to those who had the means to pay for it, whereas poorer people remained illiterate.

Mandatory primary education was introduced by Empress [[Maria Theresa of Austria]] (1740&amp;ndash;1780), mandating in 1775 that all children of both sexes from the ages of six to twelve had to attend school. Furthermore, textbooks were unified and teacher education was regulated. Even though schooling became compulsory for both girls and boys for a time period of six years, girls were not allowed to attend professional or secondary schools. The Austrian literacy rate became one of the highest in the Habsburg Empire during the beginning of the 19th century due to this development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Baten, Jörg |title=A History of the Global Economy. From 1500 to the Present.|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=50|isbn=9781107507180}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first secondary school for girls was opened in 1868, whilst the first ''[[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]'' for girls was founded in 1892. From 1872 girls were also allowed to graduate, yet remained excluded from universities. Women were admitted to the Philosophical Faculty in 1897. In 1900 they were also admitted to the Faculty of Medicine. It was only in 1919 that women were admitted to the Faculty of Law, in 1923 to the Faculty of Protestant Theology, and 1946 to the Faculty of Catholic Theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.univie.ac.at/archiv/tour/15.htm|title=Women Students|author=|date=|website=www.univie.ac.at}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910 girls were admitted to boys‘ gymnasiums, but they were neither allowed to participate actively in class, nor to take part in exams.

The history of the Austrian education system after [[World War II]] may be characterised as an attempt to transform higher education from a traditional entitlement of the upper social classes to more equal access for all social classes. Before the School Act of 1962, Austria had a “two-track” education system. After four years of compulsory primary education from the ages of six to ten in the elementary school, or [[Volksschule]] (pl., Volksschulen), children and their parents had to choose between the compulsory secondary level for eleven- to fourteen-year-olds called the middle school, or [[Hauptschule]] (pl., Hauptschulen), or the first four years of an eight-year university preparatory track at higher schools of general education (Allgemeinbildende Höhere Schulen, or AHS). An AHS, also known as a [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]], is an institution providing different fields of specialization that grant the [[diploma]] (Reifeprüfung or [[Matura]]) needed to enter university. (Other than ''Berufsbildende Höhere Schulen'', which also allow access to university, they do not provide graduates with any specific skill immediately useful on the labour market, but concentrate on general education in the humanities, science and languages).

Before the 1962 reform, the great majority of children, more than 90%, attended the compulsory Hauptschule, where they were divided according to their performance in elementary school into two groups: an “A group,” which was directed toward two- to four-year vocational-technical training schools after graduation from the Hauptschule; and a “B group,” which was required to complete one additional year of compulsory education before entrance into apprenticeship programs or the work force. The remaining elementary-school graduates—less than 10%—enrolled in the AHS at age eleven. Children attending these university-track schools also had to choose a specific course of study.

The rigidity of the two-track system required that the most important educational decision in a child’s life—with all of the implications it had for the future—be made at the age of ten. The decision depended to a great extent on the parents’ background, income, and social status. Children from agricultural backgrounds or of urban working-class parents generally attended the Volkschule and the Hauptschule and then entered the work force. Children having lower-middle-class backgrounds frequently received vocational-technical training after the Hauptschule, while children from the upper-middle and upper classes, boys in particular, attended the AHS, which gave them access to university-level education.

The early selection process meant that children of the largest segment of the population, farmers and workers, were grossly under-represented at higher schools and universities, whereas the children of a relatively small segment of the population, those who had attended higher schools or the universities, were over-represented. Consequently, the education system tended to reproduce or to reinforce traditional social structures instead of being a vehicle of opportunity or social mobility.

The Act of 1962 and subsequent amendments require that all state-funded schools be open to children regardless of birth, gender, race, status, class, language, or religion. The law also attempts to introduce more flexibility into the traditional two-track system and to provide students with a greater degree of latitude within it so that educational (and hence career) decisions can be made at an older age. Although the primary and secondary school system continues to be fundamentally based on the two-track idea, after a series of reforms in the 1970s and 1980s, ten- to fourteen-year-olds are no longer streamed into A and B groups in the Hauptschule. Graduates of this kind of school also have the opportunity to cross over into certain branches of the AHS track at the age of fourteen or to attend a series of different “higher vocational-technical schools” ([[Berufsbildende Höhere Schule]]n and [[Höhere Technische Lehranstalt]]en), which have five-year programs of specialisation in various branches of technology (HTL = ''Höhere Technische Lehranstalt'') and in business and commerce (HAK = ''Handelsakademie''). Other than the less prestigious three-year [[Berufsbildende Mittlere Schulen]], those schools allow graduates to move on to university.

Shifts in enrolment patterns reflect these changes in the school system. In the mid-1960s, less than 10% of all students finished the university preparatory AHS track, and more than 66% of them were male. By the early 1990s, more than 30% of all students finished the AHS track and just above 50% of them were female. Furthermore, a second educational path was developed that permitted some students without a diploma from the university-track AHS to enrol in a university.

As a general rule, the quality of Hauptschule education is high, especially in rural areas and small communities, where the schools have maintained their traditional social importance and where attendance at an AHS involves commuting considerable distances, or, for the inhabitants of more remote areas, [[boarding school|boarding]]. In urban centres with a full spectrum of educational opportunities, the Hauptschule has become less popular, and parents who would not necessarily have enrolled their children in an AHS a few years ago have begun doing so. The increased enrolments have overburdened the AHS and created a shortage of students at the Hauptschulen and at vocational-technical schools.

In some areas, this trend has been strengthened by the number of children of foreign workers in the compulsory schools. In 1991, for example, almost 30% of all school-age children in [[Vienna]] were children of foreign-born workers, whose mother-tongue was not German. In some districts of the city, these children exceeded 70%. Although the children of long-term foreign workers frequently speak [[German language|German]] well, the numbers of classes in which students with inadequate mastery of German are over-represented has overburdened the Hauptschule system and made it a less desirable alternative than it used to in the past. Therefore, special remedial and intercultural programs are being developed so that the compulsory school system in Austria can continue to fulfil its educational and social roles.

The [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|SPÖ]] has continued to press for further reforms of the school system. It argued for an abolition of the two-track system for ten- to fourteen-year-olds and for combining the Hauptschule and the first four years of the AHS into a new comprehensive middle school. {{As of|2007}}, however, this alternative has been limited to a number of experimental schools. Other political parties, the [[Austrian People's Party]] in particular, remain firmly in favour of the current system, claiming that a comprehensive middle school could not accommodate for different levels of capability and talent. They fear a general "[[dumbing down]]" of secondary education as a result. Owing to the particular nature of Austria's educational laws (a two-thirds majority is required, see above) a multi-party consensus is needed to change the status quo.

==Matura==
The official term for [[Matura]] in Austria is ''Reifeprüfung''. The document received after the successful completion of the written and oral exams is called ''Maturazeugnis''.

In the gymnasium (AHS = ''Allgemeinbildende Höhere Schule''), which, as opposed to vocational schools, focuses on general education, the Matura consists of 3–4 written exams (referred to as ''Schriftliche Arbeit'', 4–5 hours each) to be taken on consecutive mornings (usually in May) and 2-3 oral exams to be taken on the same half-day about a month later (usually in June). All examinations are held at the school which the candidate last attended. Candidates have to write a scholarly paper (called ''Vorwissenschaftliche Arbeit'') to be submitted at the beginning of February. This paper also needs to be defended in an oral exam.

Vocational schools with a focus on either business and economics or technical subjects, such as commercial academies (HAK = "Handelsakademie") and polytechnics (HTL = "Höhere Technische Lehranstalt") also finish with the Matura, but last five years as opposed to the four-year Oberstufe (upper stage) of the Gymnasium. In vocational schools, an Ausbildungsschwerpunkt is chosen by all students, which then constitutes the main focus of their schooling, and is a compulsory subject at the Matura examinations.

The [[Grade (education)|grading system]] is the one universally used in Austrian schools: 1 (sehr gut) is excellent; 2 (gut) is good; 3 (befriedigend) is satisfactory; 4 (genügend) is sufficient and 5 (nicht genügend) means that you have failed. In addition, a candidate’s Maturazeugnis contains a formalized overall assessment: "mit ausgezeichnetem Erfolg bestanden" (pass with distinction: an average of 1.5 or better, no grade below 3), "mit gutem Erfolg bestanden" (pass with merit: an average of 2.0 or better, no grade below 3), "bestanden" (pass: no grade below 4); and nicht bestanden (fail: at least one grade 5). Candidates who have failed may re-take their exams in September/October or February/March of the following school year.

Compulsory subjects for the written finals are [[German language|German]] and [[Mathematics]], as well as a modern foreign language (usually [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] or [[Italian language|Italian]]).

Since 2015 it is centralised, which has caused a lot of critics. There is just one external examiner: Candidates are set tasks of the oral finals by their own (former) teachers. Formally, however, there is an examination board consisting of a candidate’s teachers/examiners, the headmaster/headmistress and a Vorsitzende(r) (head), usually a high-ranking school official or the head of another school. All oral exams are public, but attendance by anyone other than a candidate’s former schoolmates is not encouraged, and indeed rare.

It is, of course, possible for Austrians of all age groups to take the Matura. Adults from their twenties on are usually tutored at private institutions of adult education before taking their final tests, held separately before a regional examination board.

Criticism of the Austrian Matura has been persistent. In particular, it has been argued that the current system encourages [[rote learning]] (see also education reform), hinders students’ creativity and obscures the fact that the body of knowledge is constantly changing. Various forms of alternative assessment have been proposed, most notably the portfolio as well as teamwork and peer review also in exam situations.

In fiction, [[Friedrich Torberg]]’s [[novel]] ''Der Schüler Gerber'' (1930) about a Matura candidate driven to suicide on the day of his oral exams by his cruel mathematics teacher has become a classic.

==Education Technology in Austrian Education==
Austrian Education system define education technology as" the use of technology to improve education. It is a systematic, iterative process for designing instruction or training used to improve performance"

Other definition:
"Educational technology is the incorporation of Internet and other information technologies into the learning experience"

==Higher education==
{{See also|List of universities in Austria}}

===Universities===
The General Act for University Education of 1966 and the University Organization Act of 1975 provide the legal framework for [[tertiary education]], and the federal Ministry for Science and Research funds and oversees education at the university level. Austria's 23 public and 13 private universities enjoy a high degree of autonomy and offer a full spectrum of degree programs. Established in 1365, the [[University of Vienna]] is Austria’s oldest and largest university.

As a result of the reforms since the 1960s, the university system has changed from one serving the elite to one serving the masses. The growing number of students at [[List of universities in Austria|Austrian universities]] reflects the liberalization of educational policy at secondary and higher levels. Between the 1955–56 and 1991–92 academic years, the number of students enrolled in institutions of higher education increased from about 19,000 to more than 200,000. The number of students beginning university-level education after completing the AHS program also increased and amounted to 85% in 1990, compared with 60% in the mid-1960s.

Traditionally, students were free to enroll at any (public) university and in any subject they wished to. It is even possible to enroll in several subject fields concurrently (which is often done by gifted students to signal their abilities to the job market). Recently, restrictions in a number of fields have been introduced. Currently, the affected subjects are: Biology, Human Medicine, Dentistry, Veterinary Medicine, Pharmacology, Psychology, Journalism and Economic Sciences.

The reforms also meant that university education ceased to be a [[male privilege]]. Between the 1960–61 and 1991–92 academic years, the proportion of female students enrolling at universities rose from 23 to 44%. Yet, although women account for almost half of the students at university level, only 2% of professors at institutions of higher learning were women in 1990.

Despite the increase in the numbers of university students and the greater presence of women, universities remain primarily the domain of middle- and higher-income groups. The proportion of students from working-class backgrounds doubled from 7 to 14%, and the number of these from agricultural backgrounds increased from less than 2% to more than 4% between 1960 and 1990. But children of [[white-collar worker]]s, civil servants, and the self-employed accounted for more than 80% of enrollments at Austrian institutions of higher education in the early 1990s.

The country’s university system was free until 2001; since then studies have been subject to fees (€366 per term for Austrian citizens, about €700 per term for non-Austrians). There are some non-state exceptions to this, where students can still study for a subsidized education, for example within the campus system of the [[English Teacher Training College]]. In 2008, however, the government decided to abolish fees for students who complete their studies in the minimum time and are EU/EEA citizens, but not for others.

Increased accessibility to university-level education has a number of consequences. The dramatic expansion in the number of students led to overcrowding at many institutions. Some critics maintain that the increasing number of students diminishes the overall quality of university-level education despite increases in federal investment. One obvious problem was that more than 50% of students enrolled at universities in the 1980s dropped out before obtaining a degree. Complex reasons account for this high drop-out rate.&lt;ref&gt;Csizmazia, Roland A. &amp; Jambor, Paul Z.  [http://hrmars.com/hrmars_papers/Korean_Higher_Education_on_the_Rise_Time_to_Learn_From_the_Success.pdf "Korean Education on the Rise: Time to Learn from the Success - Comparative Research at the Tertiary Education Level"], ''International Journal of Academic Research in Progressive Education and Development'', (pages 5-7): Volume 3 – Issue 2, March, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Some students simply enrolled to acquire student benefits; others study for the sake of personal enrichment without really intending to get a degree. Some are unable to complete their studies for financial reasons. Although a university degree provides students with a substantial amount of social status and better income opportunities, there has been an increase in “academic unemployment,” especially among degree-holders in the humanities and social sciences.

===Fachhochschulen (Universities of Applied Sciences) since the 1990s===
During the 1990s, Austria introduced [[Fachhochschule]]n (University of Applied Sciences) in addition to the traditional universities. The training at these colleges is more tailored to practically applicable professional skills. Furthermore, students are allowed much less liberty in choosing which and how many courses they take during a given semester, which ensures that virtually all students graduate within the prescribed time (usually three years for the bachelor's degree).

===Private Universities since 2001===
Accreditation of [[private university#Austria|private universities]] started in 2001, based on a federal law (''Universitäts-Akkreditierungsgesetz''). Accreditation includes the right to legally grant [[academic degree]]s. The ''Akkreditierungsrat'' (accreditation council, [http://www.akkreditierungsrat.at/]) evaluates applicants and issues recommendations to the responsible accreditation authority, the Federal Ministry of Education, Science, and Cultural Affairs. Accreditations must be renewed regularly and can be withdrawn, e.g. in case of repeated academic misconduct. In 2003, the accreditation of [[International University Vienna]] was withdrawn. In 2006, when the accreditation of [[Imadec Executive Education|Imadec University]] expired, the accreditation council rejected the request for renewal. Today (2011), 13 private universities are accredited (listed [[private university#Austria|here]]).

===The Gehrer-Schüssel reforms===
The former Minister of Education, [[Elisabeth Gehrer]], of the [[Wolfgang Schüssel|Schüssel]] government, has enacted extensive reforms to the higher education system &amp;mdash; sometimes referred to as the Gehrer-Schüssel reforms &amp;mdash; during the last years. Effective 2003, universities have become independent [[juristic person]]s and have been given considerably more discretion by the law to act without ministerial control. However, codetermination of [[professor]]s, junior teachers and students has been replaced by a more hierarchical system with a powerful management on top. The university councils, whose members are in part appointed by the government, are in charge of appointing the senior managers (''Rektorat'') and overseeing their activity.

Three medical universities (Vienna, Graz and Innsbruck) have been separated from their previous ''almae matres'', and after undergoing the appropriate accreditation procedure two other private universities have now been established. Newly appointed professors are no longer government employees, and universities are supposed to compete with each other.

In spite of the potential the increased flexibility gives to universities, there are some severe problems with the reform. First, budgets have not been increased (except to account for inflation), even though it is more expensive to hire professors as private employees, because of taxes and increased social insurance contributions.

Universities are not able to select students for admission, and they are not permitted to penalize students who abuse free access to university and free choice in studies. Moderate tuition fees were introduced in 2001, which are supposed to create a small incentive for students to graduate more quickly.

===Academic degrees===
In Austria, there is no institution comparable to the American [[college]] or to the American [[professional school]]. Students enroll in one (or more) field of studies, in which they are expected to graduate after four to six years. Since the 1970s, the first degree was the ''[[Magister (degree)|Magister]]'' (= Latin for Master, abbr. ''Mag.'') in the humanities, economic and social sciences, law and natural sciences. The first degree in engineering and agriculture is the ''[[Diplom]]-Ingenieur'' (abbr. ''Dipl.-Ing.'' or ''DI''). Recently, and in accordance with the [[Bologna process]], many universities have begun to introduce a bachelor's degree also, which comes before the "Magister" or Master.

[[Medicine]] is left as the subject where a doctorate is the only degree (after at least six years). In most subject fields, students need to submit a ''Diplomarbeit'', a research paper of an average of about 100 pages, but sometimes considerably longer. As the requirements differ strongly and are not always clear, some students spend years working on this thesis, thus (usually not deliberately) delaying graduation.

Postgraduate degrees such as [[LL.M.]]s and [[MBA]]s have been introduced since the 1990s.

However, with the [[Bologna process]], Austria has committed to transform its system to the structure of distinguishing between [[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor]] and [[Master's degree|Master]] degrees (of 3 years and 1–2 years respectively). In some fields, it is still not clear how this will be made compatible with the traditional requirements necessary to enter a regulated profession.

==The debate on reform==
Debates about educational policy in Austria frequently are the result of different perspectives related to the strengths and weaknesses of the traditional education system. Proponents of the two-track secondary system, for example, defend it as performance oriented and criticize the leveling of achievement or lowering of standards the introduction of a single compulsory middle school would involve. Conversely, opponents of the two-track system criticize its rigidity and inherent absence of equal opportunity. Consequently, such bipolar terms as performance and leveling, elite and mass education, and achievement and equal opportunity prevail in educational debates. In some respects, Austrians of different political and educational policy persuasions may expect too many different things from one university system. They expect it to provide general education, as do [[state university]] systems in the [[United States]], and “[[Ivy League]]” performance at the same time.

'''[[Bahrain]]''' has the oldest '''[[public education]] system''' in the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. The system was established in 1930 when the [[Cabinet of Bahrain|Bahraini government]] assumed responsibility for operating two pre-existing primary public schools for boys. Subsequently, separate girls' schools and various universities were established in the 20th century. According to data from the 2010 [[census]], the [[literacy rate]] of Bahrain stands at 94.6%. As of 2016, education expenditure accounts for 2.7% of Bahrain's [[GDP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bahrain|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ba.html|publisher=CIA - The World Factbook|accessdate=20 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Hidaya Al Khalifa Boys School Bahrain 1919.jpg|thumb|Al-Hidaya Al-Khalifia Boys school.]]
[[Quranic school]]s were the only source of education in Bahrain prior to the 20th century; such schools were primarily dedicated to the study of the [[Qur'an]].&lt;ref name=MoE&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.moe.gov.bh/en/history/Index.aspx|publisher=Ministry of Education - Bahrain|accessdate=20 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130816084629/http://www.moe.gov.bh/en/history/Index.aspx|archivedate=16 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first modern school to open in the country was a [[missionary]] [[elementary school]] setup in 1892 (according to one account) in [[Manama]] by the  [[American Dutch Reformed Church]], with the school's syllabus comprising English, Mathematics and the study of [[Christianity]]. Leading merchants in the country sent their children to the school until it was closed down in 1933 due to financial difficulties.{{sfn|Shirawi|1987|p=59}} The school reopened some years later under the name of [[Al Raja School]] where it operates till the present day.

Parents who could afford to fund their children's studies often sent them to schools in [[Bombay]] or [[Baghdad]]. Families of a predominately religious background often sent their children to religious institutions in the region, to [[madrasa]]s in [[Mecca]] and [[Al-Hasa]] in mainland Arabia for Sunni students and to [[Najaf]] and [[Karbala]] for Shia students. As a result of this traditional religious education, there was a negative stigma attached to the American Mission School and only a few parents were bold enough to send their children to the school.{{sfn|Shirawi|1987|p=60}} Prior to the establishment of a public school in the country, Shia and Sunni students had limited interactions during their education. This can be attributed to different environments of learning; outside of religious institutions, Shia students acquired knowledge from [[Hussainia|matam]]s whereas Sunni students did from [[majlis]]es although neither matam nor majlis were officially recognised as educational institutions in their own right.{{sfn|Shirawi|1987|p=60-61}}
[[File:Jaafaria School Bahrain 1931.png|thumb|left|The Jafaria school in [[Manama]], 1931.]]
Following the end of the [[First World War]], [[Western culture|Western ideas]] became more widespread in the country, culminating in the opening of the first [[state school|public school]] of Bahrain, Al-Hidaya Al-Khalifia Boys school, in the island of [[Muharraq]] in 1919.&lt;ref name=MoE/&gt; The school was founded by prominent citizens of Muharraq and was endorsed by the [[Al Khalifa|Bahraini royal family]]. The country's first Education Committee was established by several leading Bahraini merchants, headed by Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa Al-Khalifa, the son of the then-ruler of Bahrain [[Isa ibn Ali Al Khalifa]], who acted as the [[de facto]] [[Minister of Education]]. The Education Committee was also responsible for managing the Al-Hidaya Boys school.&lt;ref name=MoE/&gt; The school was in fact the brainchild of Shaikh Abdulla, who suggested the idea after returning from post-World War I celebrations in [[England]].{{sfn|Shirawi|1987|p=61}}

In 1926, a second public school for boys opened up in the capital city, Manama. Two years later, in 1928, the first public school for girls was established. Due to financial constraints suffered by the Education Committee, the Bahraini government took control of the schools in 1930.&lt;ref name=MoE/&gt;

==Government schools==
[[File:Village School Bahrain.png|thumb|left|A [[village school]], circa 1937.]]
In the 1986–87 academic year, 88,152 students attended 139 [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]]. Education in the public system, which included six-year primary schools, three-year intermediate schools, and three-year secular secondary schools, is free. Students receive supplies, uniforms, meals, and transportation to and from school at no charge. Almost all children in the six- to eleven-year-old age-group attend [[primary school]], and about two-thirds of all twelve- to fourteen-year-olds are enrolled in intermediate schools. However, there was a significant drop-out rate, especially for girls, after the completion of intermediate school. In the 1986–87 academic year, only 41 percent of fifteen- to seventeen-year-olds attended secondary schools.

In the academic year of 2008/2009 the number of public classes in Bahrain ( including religious classes) are 4326, with the number of male students 62381 and female students 63233. with a distribution of 62172 in primary classes, 32327 in preparatory classes (junior high) and 31115 in secondary schools.

==Private schools==
[[File:Iranian School in Bahrain 1939.jpg|thumb|Students of the Persian School in 1939.]]
In addition to the American Mission School, another foreign private school was opened in 1910; Al-Ittihad school, funded by the [[Persians in Bahrain|Persian community of Bahrain]].{{sfn|Shirawi|1987|p=60}}

In addition to the public education system, there are forty-eight private and [[Parochial school|religious schools]], including the [[United States]] operated and accredited [[Bahrain School]], (which occupies the older school - [[Awali School]] built for the children of expat foreign nationals who worked for BAPCO and lived mainly in Awali) in the 1950's. Bahrain School now offers classes from primary school through secondary school, whereas the original "Awali School" provided no secondary education so children went to boarding schools in their home countries after the age of about 11 years. In Bahrain there were 5,000 teachers in 1988, of whom 65 percent were native Bahrainis. [[Egyptians]] constituted the largest group of foreign teachers. Bahrain also is home to [[St. Christopher's School, Bahrain|St Christopher’s School]],which the Guardian has named as one of the eight best international schools in the world, the only school in the Middle East to make the list. 10 universities provide internationally recognized qualifications. Other notable schools include [[British School of Bahrain]], [[Indian School, Bahrain|The Indian School]] and [[Sacred Heart School (Bahrain)|Sacred Heart School]]

==Higher education==
In 1927 the first group of Bahrainis to receive a university education enrolled at the [[American University of Beirut]] in [[Lebanon]]. The first institution of higher education in Bahrain, the Gulf Polytechnic, was established in 1968 as the Gulf Technical College. In 1984 Gulf Polytechnic merged with the University College of Art, Science, and Education (UCB), founded in 1979, to create a national university offering bachelor of arts and bachelor of science degrees. During the 1991–92 academic year, more than 4,000 students, half of whom were women, studied at the two campuses of UCB/Polytechnic.

In 2008 a new [[Bahrain Polytechnic]] opened on the [[University of Bahrain]]'s old campus location at [[Isa Town]].

Bahrain had three additional institutions of higher education in 1993. The [[College of Health Sciences, Bahrain|College of Health Sciences]], established in 1959, offers various medical technology and nurses' training programs. The Hotel and Catering Training Center offers postsecondary vocational courses in management and [[culinary arts]]. The newest institution, the [[Arabian Gulf University]] (AGU), was established outside [[Riffa]] in 1984 and funded by the six member countries of the GCC. Construction of AGU facilities, however, was delayed by the decline in oil revenues experienced by all GCC states in the mid-1980s. The first faculty, the College of Medicine, opened in the fall of 1989 and provided medical education for fifty-eight aspiring [[physicians]]. The projected completion date for the AGU campus is 2006; officials anticipate that AGU will accommodate 5,000 students annually, once the university becomes fully operational.

The AGU campus has been completed to contain a faculty of medicine, faculty of agriculture and [[Al Jawhara bint Ibrahim Al Ibrahim|Princess Jawhara]] of Saudi Arabia donated a centre for molecular biology &amp; inherited disorders. Built right across the street from the campus to encourage the development of regional research in this issue.

Further liberalisation of the education sector has occurred in Bahrain.  New private universities are sprouting up by the day, which has led to a low standard of education in some of these private establishments. This low standard has led to the establishment of the [[Quality Assurance Authority for Education and Training]], which primarily focuses on scrutinising all the programs offered by each university.

Private education in Dubai is regulated by the [[Knowledge and Human Development Authority]]. The UAE Ministry of Education is responsible for public schools in Dubai. Currently, more than 90% of school education in Dubai takes place in the private sector, served by 194 private schools offering 17 different curricula to more than 280,000 students from 182 nationalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.khda.gov.ae/Areas/Administration/Content/FileUploads/Publication/Documents/English/20180624082407_DubaiEducationLandscape2018_Eng.pdf|title=Doing Well, Being Well - Dubai's Private Education Landscape, 2017/18|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dubai has 26 international branch campuses of universities from 12 different countries - including the UK, Australia and India. More than 30,000 students attend these universities, with the majority studying business, engineering and media &amp; design. The [[Knowledge and Human Development Authority]] (KHDA) was founded in 2006 to develop education and human resource sectors in Dubai, and license educational institutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.khda.gov.ae/En/AboutUs/AboutKHDA.aspx|work=KHDA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public Schooling ==
{{see also|Public Schools in Dubai}}
Public schools are all gender segregated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/28/world/middleeast/28iht-educlede28.html|title=In the Gulf, Boys Falling Behind in School|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primary and secondary education is free of cost for all Emiratis and compulsory for boys and girls at the all grades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ministry of education in the UAE|url=http://www.moe.gov.ae/English/Pages/default.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; The medium of instruction in public schools is Arabic with emphasis on English as a second language. 

== Private Schooling ==
As of 2017, there are 194&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://whichschooladvisor.com/area-guide/dubai|title=Dubai|access-date=2017-06-18|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; private schools in Dubai that offer one of the following curricula (arranged by number of schools following curriculum): [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|British]], [[Indian Certificate of Secondary Education|Indian]], [[Education in the United States|American]], the UAE Ministry of Education Curriculum, [[International Baccalaureate]], [[Education in Iran|Iranian]], French, [[Education in the Philippines|Filipino]], [[Education in Pakistan|Pakistani]], [[SABIS]], IAT, [[Education in Germany|German]], [[Education in Russia|Russian]], [[Education in Japan|Japanese]], and [[Education in Canada|Canadian]]. In total, 273,599 students from 187 different nationalities were enrolled in private schools in the 2016/17 academic year. This is heavily weighted towards younger year groups with 42% in primary education, 25% in secondary, 15% in tertiary, and 18% in kindergarten. The British and Indian curricula alone account for 64% of all enrollment in Dubai-based private schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Report on 2014/15 Private Education in Dubai|year=2015|url=https://www.khda.gov.ae/En/Reports/Publications.aspx?pubid=10190#.VSaTlPnF91A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tuition at these private schools range from AED 1,725 to AED 107,200 per year&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://whichschooladvisor.com/insights/complete-dubai-school-fees-2017|title=Complete Dubai School Fees 2017|access-date=2017-06-18|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and Dubai's annual revenue from private schooling fees is AED 5.35bn. 39% of students pay less than AED 10,000 in tuition per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Report on 2014/15 Private Education in Dubai|year=2015|url=https://www.khda.gov.ae/En/Reports/Publications.aspx?pubid=10190#.VSaTlPnF91A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some correlation between fees and the rating of the school, and this has strengthened with the KHDA ruling on school fees that allows top rated Outstanding schools to put up fees at a higher percentage than those rated more poorly. A list of the highest rated schools in Dubai with fees may be found [https://whichschooladvisor.com/guides/the-best-schools-dubai-khda here].

Schools in the UAE teach in English.

All students take Arabic classes, either as a primary or secondary language.  Muslim and Arab students must also take Islamic studies.

=== Primary education ===
Primary education is compulsory from the age of 5 by the Ministry of Education in the UAE.  Most schools offers both primary and secondary instruction so students do not need to transfer to a separate school location upon graduating from primary school.

American curriculum runs from Kindergarten (5 years old) to Grade 8 (14 years old). [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|British curriculum]] runs from Year 1 (4–5 years old) to Year 9 (14 years old). International Baccalaureate Primary Years Programme is for ages 3–12.

=== Secondary education ===
Secondary school is from grades 6 to 9. Most of the secondary schools require students to take standardized tests such as [[Advanced Placement]], [[SAT]], [[IB Diploma Programme|IB Diploma]], [[International General Certificate of Secondary Education|IGCSE]], [[GCE Advanced Level|GCE Advanced level]] or [[Central Board of Secondary Education|CBSE]].
Other options include vocational education [[PEARSON BTEC]] level 2 Diplomas and Level 3 Extended Diplomas. A new curriculum being offered is the IB Career-related Programme&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ibo.org/en/programmes/career-related-programme/|title=What is the Career Programme? {{!}} International Baccalaureate®|work=International Baccalaureate®|access-date=2018-05-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can include a BTEC and is offered at 6 schools in UAE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ibo.org/en/programmes/find-an-ib-school/?SearchFields.Region=&amp;SearchFields.Country=AE&amp;SearchFields.Keywords=&amp;SearchFields.Language=&amp;SearchFields.BoardingFacilities=&amp;SearchFields.SchoolGender=&amp;SearchFields.ProgrammeCR=true|title=Find an IB World School|work=International Baccalaureate®|access-date=2018-05-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tertiary education ==
A sizable number of foreign accredited universities have been set up in Dubai.  Most of their campuses are located at [[Dubai International Academic City]], a purpose built free zone for tertiary academic institutions. The Harvard Medical School Dubai Center (HMSDC) Institute for Postgraduate Education and Research has been established as well in Dubai Health Care City. The RIT Dubai campus is located in Dubai Silicon Oasis.

In 2010, Michigan State University Dubai closed all undergraduate programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Swan|first=Melanie|title=Michigan State University shuts most of its Dubai campus|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/education/michigan-state-university-shuts-most-of-its-dubai-campus|newspaper=The National|date=6 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Education of Hawaiian Youths Abroad''' was a government-funded educational program during the reign of King [[Kalākaua]], to help students further their educations beyond the institutions available in Hawaii at that time. Students were personally selected by Kalākaua, based upon family background and academic excellence. All living accommodations and expenses were taken care of for chosen students enrolled in a foreign university or apprenticed outside of the kingdom of Hawaii to learn a trade.

On June{{nbsp}}1, 1880, representative [[Robert Hoapili Baker]], formerly a member of the king's Household Guard, succeeded in getting the House of Representatives to appropriate $15,000 to support the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Resolutions|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82015418/1880-06-05/ed-1/seq-5/|accessdate=January 24, 2017|via=Chronicling America: Historic American Newspapers. Lib. of Congress.|newspaper=The Pacific Commercial Advertiser|date=June 5, 1880|location=Honolulu, Hawaiian Islands}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further appropriations for the program were $30,000 in 1882, $25,000 in 1884, and $30,000 in 1886, for an aggregate total of $100,000 investment in the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hawaiian Legislature: Department of Foreign Affairs|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82015418/1882-06-10/ed-1/seq-5/|accessdate=January 24, 2017|via=Chronicling America: Historic American Newspapers.

Between 1880 and 1887, five young Hawaiians, four boys and one girl, were sent to study in Italy. The first group of students were [[Robert Napuʻuako Boyd]], [[Robert William Wilcox]] and James Kaneholo Booth, leaving Honolulu on August 30, 1880, under the guardianship of [[Celso Caesar Moreno]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quigg|1988|p=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kalākaua intended for them to be sent to a Prussian military academy; however, once in Prussia, Moreno decided the designated school did not have the structure Kalākaua had in mind. The three young men were eventually enrolled at three different academies in [[Livorno]], [[Turin]] and [[Naples]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quigg|1988|p=176}}; {{cite news|title=Letter From Europe No. 40|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82015418/1881-01-29/ed-1/seq-4/|accessdate=January 24, 2017|via=Chronicling America: Historic American Newspapers.

Lib. of Congress.|newspaper=The Pacific Commercial Advertiser|date=October 28, 1884|location=Honolulu, Hawaiian Islands}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second group of two students were sent to the Military Academy of Turin in 1887 to prepare for a career in the cultural arts. [[August Hering]] was a student in sculpture, and [[Maile Nowlein]], daughter of Colonel [[Samuel Nowlein]], studied art and music. Both were guests at Wilcox's wedding to Baronessa Gina Sobrero.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quigg|1988|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three students were escorted to [[Glasgow]], Scotland by [[Charles Hastings Judd]] in 1882 and apprenticed at the Scotland Street Iron Works. One of them, [[Hugo Kawelo]], returned to Hawaii in 1885 due to ill health. The other two, [[Henry Kapena]] and [[John Lovell (Hawaii)|John Lovell]] were able to complete their apprenticeship in 1886, and secured positions in San Francisco. Kapena returned to Hawaii within months of arriving in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quigg|1988|pp=184–187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1882, Judd accompanied Joseph A. Kamauoha for his enrollment at [[King's College London]]. He accompanied [[Matthew Makalua]] and [[Abraham Charles Piianaia]] to their enrollment at [[Denstone College]]. All three students were placed under the guardianship of Hawaii Consul-General Manley Hopkins, who sent regular detailed accounts to Kalākaua. Hopkins gave each student an allowance, and taught them how to manage a budget by requiring them to pay their own expenses out of the allowance. In 1886, Kamauoha succumbed to a lengthy illness thought to be the result of London's weather. Piianaia pursued studies in law, and was called home after the Bayonet Constitution was signed. He became principal of the Government English School at Ulupalakua, Maui. In 1890, he married Fanny Malulani, a student of [[St. Andrew's Priory School]] in Honolulu. A quilt made by students at St. Andrews Priory as a wedding present is in a collection at the [[Bishop Museum]] in Honolulu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crazy Quilt|url=http://data.bishopmuseum.org/ethnologydb/detailed.php?ARTNO=1941.102|publisher=Bishop Museum|accessdate=January 26, 2017}}; {{cite news|title=The Late Mr. James Booth|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85047084/1890-07-25/ed-1/seq-3/|accessdate=January 26, 2017|via=Chronicling America: Historic American Newspapers.

Manley was able to convince the Hawaiian government to allow Makalua to remain in London until he completed his medical studies in 1890. Makalua never returned to Hawaii, but remained in England and became a doctor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quigg|1988|pp=187–195}}; {{cite web|title=Dr. Makalua|url=http://friendsofhastingscemetery.org.uk/makaluam.html|publisher=Friends of Hastings Cemetery}}; {{cite web|title=Person Page – 36975|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p36975.htm#i369742|website=The Peerage Page|accessdate=January 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1882, Judd enrolled [[Thomas Spencer (Hawaii)|Thomas Spencer]] at [[Saint Matthew's Episcopal Day School]] in [[San Mateo, California]].  In 1885, [[Thomas Pualii Cummins]], son of [[John Adams Cummins]], and the king's three nephews, [[David Kawānanakoa]], [[Edward Abnel Keliʻiahonui]], and [[Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole]] were also enrolled in the school. Keliʻiahonui fell ill with [[typhoid fever]] in September 1887, and was immediately returned to Hawaii where he died on September 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Prince Keliʻiahonui|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85047084/1887-09-22/ed-1/seq-3/|accessdate=January 27, 2017|via=Chronicling America: Historic American Newspapers. Lib. of Congress.|newspaper=The Pacific Commercial Advertiser|date=September 22, 1887|location=Honolulu, Hawaiian Islands}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Henry Grube Marchant]] was sent to Boston in 1887 to study engraving.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quigg|1988|pp=198–201}}; {{harvnb|Allen|1995|page=96–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three youths were sent to China and Japan for Asian studies, but not a lot is recorded about them. [[James Kapaa]] studied in Canton, China from 1882 until his return to Hawaii in 1885. [[James Hakuole]] and [[Isaac Harbottle]] were sent to Japan in 1882 under the guardianship of R. W. Lewin. They became fluent in the Japanese language and immersed in the culture of Japan. In 1887 Lewin recommended both young men be enrolled in the Imperial Japanese Military University. The enrollment never happened, because they were called home after the Bayonet Constitution went into effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quigg|1988|pp=195–198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding for the program ended with the political upheaval following the signing of the Bayonet Constitution in 1887. Most of the students were recalled home to Hawaii. Unable to find work for suited for their military training, Wilcox and Boyd, two of the most controversial returnees, participated in the unsuccessful [[Wilcox rebellion of 1889]] aimed at restoring the constitution of 1864. Critics in the English press in Hawaii noted the insurrection as an example of the folly of the program. The last student to receive governmental funding Makalua stopped receiving aid after 1894.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quigg|1988|pp=201–205}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Insurrection!|newspaper=The Daily Bulletin|location=Honolulu|date=August 1, 1889|volume=|issue=|page=2|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82016412/1889-08-01/ed-1/seq-2/}}; {{cite news|title=Unsuccessful Attempt At Revolution!|newspaper=The Daily Bulletin|location=Honolulu|date=August 2, 1889|volume=|issue=|page=2|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82016412/1889-08-02/ed-1/seq-2/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1901 legislative session of [[Territory of Hawaii]] attempted to pass a bill by Representative [[Jonah Kumalae]] to create a similar education program to send poor Hawaiian youths to the US mainland or aboard for education in top universities.{{sfn|Williams|2015|pages=1–45}} However, it was never passed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7363">A '''family history society''' or '''genealogical society''' is a [[society]], often [[Charitable organization|charitable]] or [[not-for-profit]], that allows member [[genealogist]]s and [[family history|family historian]]s to profit from shared knowledge.  Large societies often own libraries, sponsor research seminars and foreign trips, and publish journals. Some societies concentrate on a specific niche, such as the family history of a particular geographical area, [[ethnicity]], [[nationality]], or [[religion]].  Lineage societies are societies that limit their membership to descendants of a particular person or group of people of historical importance.

'''''Heir-Conditioned''''' is a [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' theatrical cartoon short released in 1955 and directed by [[Friz Freleng]] and written by [[Warren Foster]]. ''Heir-Conditioned'' is the second of three Looney Tunes shorts underwritten by the [[Alfred P. Sloan Foundation]] (the first being ''[[By Word of Mouse]]'').

==Synopsis==
The story begins with [[Sylvester (Looney Tunes)|Sylvester the Cat]] finding himself the heir of his mistress' vast fortune. While his financial adviser, [[Elmer Fudd]], is urging him to [[invest]] his money, [[Sylvester (Looney Tunes)|Sylvester]] is frightened he will simply lose his money.  Meanwhile, his street cat friends are out to get the money for themselves, but Fudd manages to thwart each attempt, including the one from Johnny, a cat who pretends to be a salesman for a "silver cleaning liquid" of the Hi-Ho Silver Cleaning Company of [[Walla Walla, Washington]].  Finally, Fudd manages an extensive lecture on the benefits of good investment on the [[economy]] with an [[educational film]] to illustrate the point. While Sylvester is not convinced, the cats outside see the film themselves and are persuaded to the point when Sylvester manages to get the money to them, they demand he give it over to Elmer for investment.  Defeated, Sylvester gives in and growls to the portrait of his mistress that his life would have been less complicated if she took her money with her.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4974">'''Luce Scholar''' is a recipient of a cultural exchange and vocational fellowship sponsored by the [[Henry Luce Foundation]], a private foundation established by [[Time, Inc.]] founder [[Henry Luce|Henry R. Luce]].

==The program==
Founded in 1974, The [[Luce Scholars Program]] provides stipends and professional placements for eighteen young Americans to live and work in Asia each year.  The program's purpose is to increase awareness of Asia among future leaders in American society.

Those who already have significant experience in Asia or Asian studies are not eligible for the Luce Scholars Program. Candidates must be American citizens who have received at least a bachelor's degree and are no more than 29 years old on September 1 of the year they enter the program. Nominees should have a record of high achievement, outstanding leadership ability, and a clearly defined career interest with evidence of potential for professional accomplishment.

Luce Scholar candidates may be nominated by one of over 70 colleges and universities. Applications are submitted by eligible institutions in early November. The Luce Foundation cannot accept applications submitted directly to the foundation.

After interviews with the foundation's staff, finalists meet with one of three selection panels who choose the eighteen Luce Scholars. Placements and support services for the Luce Scholars are provided by the Asia Foundation, an organization with field offices throughout Asia. The program begins in August and concludes the following July.  The 2010-2011 Luce Scholars competition attracted interest from 159 candidates, a record number of nominations representing 63 participating institutions.

Luce Scholars have backgrounds in virtually any field other than Asian studies; including medicine, the arts, business, law, science, environmental studies, and journalism. Placements can be made in the following countries in East and Southeast Asia: [[Cambodia]], [[China]] and [[Hong Kong]], [[Indonesia]], [[India]], [[Japan]], [[Laos]], [[Malaysia]], [[Mongolia]], [[Myanmar]], [[Nepal]], [[Philippines]], [[Singapore]], [[South Korea]], [[Taiwan]], [[Thailand]], and [[Vietnam]].

'''Home economics''', '''domestic science''' or '''home science''' is a field of study&lt;ref&gt;[[International Federation for Home Economics]] (IFHE): Position Statement in: ''International Journal of Home Economics''; Volume 1, Issue 1, available [http://www.ifhe.org here]&lt;/ref&gt; that deals with the relationship between individuals, families, communities, and the environment in which they live.

==Name==
Family and consumer science was previously known in the United States as home economics, often abbreviated "home ec" or "HE". In 1994, various organizations, including the [[American Association of Family and Consumer Sciences]], adopted the new term "family and consumer science" to reflect the fact that the field covers aspects outside of home life and wellness.&lt;ref name="faq"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aafcs.org/AboutUs/FAQ.asp#10|publisher=American Association of Family and Consumer Sciences|title=FAQ|accessdate=2015-01-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150111213950/http://www.aafcs.org/AboutUs/FAQ.asp#10|archive-date=2015-01-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The field is also known by other names, including human sciences, home science, and domestic economy. In addition, home economics has a strong historic relationship to the field of [[human ecology]], and since the 1960s a number of university-level home economics programs have been renamed "[[human ecology]]" programs, including [[Cornell University College of Human Ecology|Cornell University's program]].&lt;ref name=Cornell&gt;{{cite web|title=Why the Change to Human Ecology?|url=http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/homeEc/cases/namechange.html|publisher=Cornell University |accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Globalize|section|USA|2name=the United States|date=April 2017}}
[[File:Catharine Beecher.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Catharine Beecher, American educator]]
[[File:Ellen Swallow Richards.jpg|thumb|100px|right|Ellen Richards, photograph ca. 1864]]

One of the first to champion the economics of running a home was [[Catherine Beecher]], sister to [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]].  Catherine and Harriet both were leaders in mid-19th century North America in talking about domestic science.  They came from a very religious family that valued education especially for women.

The [[Morrill Act]] of 1862 propelled domestic science further ahead as land grant colleges sought to educate farm wives in running their households as their husbands were being educated in agricultural methods and processes. [[Iowa]], [[Kansas]], [[Nebraska]], [[Illinois]], [[Minnesota]] and [[Michigan]] were early leaders offering programs for women.  There were women graduates of these institutions several years before the [[Lake Placid Conferences]] which gave birth to the home economics movement.

The home economics movement started with [[Ellen Swallow Richards]], who was the first woman to attend [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and later became the first female instructor.  Through her [[chemistry]] research, she became an expert in water quality and later began to focus on applying scientific principles to domestic situations.  At the [[1893 Chicago World's Fair|Chicago World’s Fair]] in 1893, she designed the Rumford Kitchen, which was a tiny kitchen that served nutritious meals to thousands of fair goers, along with a healthy dose of nutrition education.  She shunned an invitation to participate in the Women’s Building as she said none of her research was just women’s work, but rather information for all.

[[Image:Home Economics 1911.jpg|thumb|250px|A home economics class in 1911 in [[Toronto]]]]
Late in the 19th century, Richards convened a group of contemporaries to discuss the essence of domestic science and how the elements of this discipline would ultimately improve the quality of life for many individuals and families. They met at pristine Lake Placid, New York at the invitation of [[Melvil Dewey]].  Over the course of the next 10 years, these educators worked tirelessly to elevate the discipline, which was to become home economics, to a legitimate profession.  Richards wanted to call this [[oekology]] or the science of right living. [[Euthenics]], the science of controllable environment, was also a name of her choice, but "home economics" was ultimately chosen as the official term in 1899.&lt;ref name=aafcs&gt;{{cite web|title=AAFCS Brand Story|url=http://www.aafcs.org/res/branding/AAFCS_Brand_Story.pdf|publisher=American Association of Family &amp; Consumer Sciences|accessdate=20 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130908184750/http://www.aafcs.org/res/branding/AAFCS_Brand_Story.pdf|archive-date=8 September 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richards then founded the American Home Economics Association (now called the [[American Association of Family and Consumer Sciences]]) in 1909.&lt;ref name=aafcs/&gt;

In the 1910s the AHEA won passage of two crucial pieces of legislation that allowed home economists to establish formal niches for research and teaching within institutions of higher education.  The [[Smith-Lever Act]] of 1914 and the [[Smith-Hughes Act]] of 1917 provided funding to expand demonstration work in rural communities and to develop and teach a home economics curriculum on the campuses of most state land-grant colleges.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Carolyn M., 2012.  Page 36.  Creating Consumers:  Home Economists in Twentieth-Century America.  Chapel Hill:  The University of North Carolina Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This legislation contributed to the creation of the Office of Home Economics, which grew into the [[Bureau of Home Economics]], at the [[US Department of Agriculture]] during the early 20th century.

Home economics emerged at the turn of the twentieth century as a movement to train women to be more efficient household managers.  At the same moment, American families began to consume many more goods and services than they produced.  To guide women in this transition, professional home economics had two major goals:  to teach women to assume their new roles as modern consumers and to communicate homemakers’ needs to manufacturers and political leaders.  The development of the profession progressed from its origins as an educational movement to its identity as a source of consumer expertise in the interwar period to its virtual disappearance by the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Carolyn M., 2012.  Dust jacket.  Creating Consumers:  Home Economists in Twentieth-Century America.  Chapel Hill:  The University of North Carolina Press.&lt;/ref&gt; An additional goal of the field was to “rationalize housework”, or lend the social status of a profession to it, based on a theory that housework could be intellectually fulfilling to women engaged in it, along with any emotional or relational benefits.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elias|first=Megan|date=January 2006|title="Model Mamas": The Domestic Partnership of Home Economics Pioneers Flora Rose and Martha Van Rensselaer|jstor=4617244|journal=Journal of the History of Sexuality|volume=15 |issue=1|pages=65–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, home economics classes were intended to ready young women for their duties in the home in healthy environments. Classes were first offered in the United States, Canada, Germany and Great Britain, followed by Latin America, Asia, and Africa. International organizations such as those associated with the [[United Nations]] have been involved in starting home economics programs around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Robert, Editor-in-Chief, et al. 1971. ''Funk  &amp; Wagnall’s New Encyclopedia''. New York: Funk &amp; Wagnall’s, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the 1940s [[Iowa State University|Iowa State College]] (later University) was the only program granting a master of science in household equipment. However, this program was centered on the ideals that women should acquire practical skills but also a scientifically based understanding of how technology in the household works. For example, women were required to disassemble and then reassemble kitchen machinery so they could understand basic operations as well as repair the equipment. In doing so, Iowa State effectively created culturally acceptable forms of physics and engineering for women in an era when these pursuits were not generally accessible to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bix|first1=Amy Sue|title=Gendered Technical Training and Consumerism in Home Economics, 1920-1980|journal=Technology and Culture|date=October 2002|volume=43|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A Home Economics class receiving instructions on cooking. Ottawa, Ontario, 1959.jpg|thumb|A Home Economics class receiving instruction in cooking, Ottawa, Ontario, 1959.]]

Home economists … found a receptive audience among many of its young female members who expressed interest in learning about how to improve their homes, spend their leisure time, and make decisions about what to buy, what to make at home, and even what books to read.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Carolyn M., 2012.  Page 13.  Creating Consumers:  Home Economists in Twentieth-Century America.  Chapel Hill:  The University of North Carolina Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Though men’s participation in Home Economics programs was encouraged it was not actively recruited, and in future courses at universities such as Cornell, men’s roles became entrenched in such courses as hotel management in the hospitality industry.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A Standards Committee’s proposal in 1924 changed the AHEA constitution allowing for a special voting membership section clearing the way for HEIB (Home Economists in Business) section.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Carolyn M., 2012.  Page 150.  Creating Consumers:  Home Economists in Twentieth-Century America.  Chapel Hill:  The University of North Carolina Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The largest group of HEIB members worked for food companies such as Washburn Crosby (later General Mills), Kellogg’s, ..or trade associations charged with promoting particular foods such as the Institute of American Meat Packers and the National Dairy Council.  [Some] worked as journalists for women’s magazines such as.. the Ladies’ Home Journal.  [Others] worked for utility companies.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Carolyn M., 2012.  Page 149.  Creating Consumers:  Home Economists in Twentieth-Century America.  Chapel Hill:  The University of North Carolina Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The function that home economists have been performing for more than a century remains key to our experiences as consumers, but the professional identity has disappeared.  Indeed, efforts to reposition the discipline ultimately led to its renaming in the late twentieth century.  In 1994, “home economics” was replaced by “family and consumer science.”…This renaming signaled a formal break from the field’s association with domesticity, highlighting instead issues of “family” and “consumption.”&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Carolyn M., 2012.  Page 295.  Creating Consumers:  Home Economists in Twentieth-Century America.  Chapel Hill:  The University of North Carolina Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

A new actor that rose to prominence in the 1980s was the charismatic celebrity unaligned with home economists or any other professional group. [[Martha Stewart]] and her fellow “domestic celebrities,” in television programs, books, magazines, and websites, attest to the continued importance of independent experts and commercial mass-media organizations in facilitating technological and cultural change in consumer products and services industries.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Carolyn M., 2012.  Page 299.  Creating Consumers:  Home Economists in Twentieth-Century America.  Chapel Hill:  The University of North Carolina Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

To a great degree, Americans today tap into values once enshrined in a home economics curriculum to express a national identity and assert a standard of living that is distinct not only from Developing Nations but also from the cultures of other Industrialized Nations....  Even as luxury consumption exerts a cultural pull for many, middle-class culture still celebrates consumers who make sensible, controlled choices in the marketplace, resisting pure pleasure, impulse purchases, and cheap or shoddy goods.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Carolyn M., 2012.  Page 300.  Creating Consumers:  Home Economists in Twentieth-Century America.  Chapel Hill:  The University of North Carolina Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Practice homes in American colleges===
Practice homes were added to American universities in the early 1900’s in order to model a living situation, although the all-women ‘team’ model used for students was different from prevailing expectations of housewives. For example, women were graded on collaboration, while households at the time assumed that women would be working independently.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Nevertheless, the practice homes were valued. These practicum courses took place in a variety of environments including single-family homes, apartments, and student dorm-style blocks. For a duration of a number of weeks, students lived together while taking on different roles and responsibilities, such as cooking, cleaning, interior decoration, hosting, and budgeting. Some classes also involved caring for young infants, temporarily adopted from orphanages. Childcare practicums were often included at the same time as other classwork, requiring students to configure their intellectual and home lives as compatible with one another. According to Megan Elias, “in the ideal, domestic work was as important as work done outside the home and it was performed by teams of equals who rotated roles. Each member of the team was able to live a life outside the home as well as inside the home, ideally, one that both informed her domestic work and was informed by it. This balance between home and the wider world was basic to the movement”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===American university departments===
Departments were set up in a number of American universities.  For example [[Brigham Young University]] had a department from 1920-1950.&lt;ref&gt;https://byuorg.lib.byu.edu/index.php/Brigham_Young_University._Dept._of_Home_Economics_(1930-1955)&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes it is also taught in [[primary education]].  International cooperation in the field is coordinated by the [[International Federation for Home Economics]], established in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ifhe.org/34.html|title=About IFHE|accessdate=2015-01-11|publisher=International Federation for Home Economics|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141207025618/http://www.ifhe.org/34.html|archive-date=2014-12-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1880 and 1900, the [[Reifenstein schools]] concept was initiated by Ida von Kortzfleisch, a Prussian noble woman and early German feminist. Reifenstein refers to Reifenstein im Eichsfeld, a municipality in Thuringia and site of the first permanent school. Reifensteiner Verband comprised from 1897 till 1990 about 15 own schools and cooperated with further operators. About 40 wirtschaftliche Frauenschulen, rural economist women schools were connected to the Reifensteiner concept and movement and allowed higher education for women already in the German Kaiserreich.&lt;ref&gt;Ortrud Wörner-Heil: Adelige Frauen als Pionierinnen der Berufsbildung: die ländliche Hauswirtschaft und der Reifensteiner Verband kassel university press GmbH, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1913 doctorate of Johannes Kramer compared different concepts of home economic education worldwide and praised the system e.g. in Iowa.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kramer: Das ländlich-hauswirtschaftliche Bildungswesen in Deutschland, University of Erlangen doctorate, Fulda 1913&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Korea===
In South Korea, the field is most commonly known as "family studies" or "family science" (가정과학, gajeong-gwahak). The field began in schools taught by Western missionaries in the late 19th century.  The first college-level department of family science was established at [[Ewha Womans University]] in [[Seoul]] in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1EizWo6iIn4C&amp;pg=PA5|publisher=Ewha Womans University Press|title=가정과학대학 70년사 (Gajeonggwahakdaehak 70-nyeonsa / 70 Years of the College of Family Science)|year=1999|isbn=9788973003839|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In 2012 there were only 3.5 million students enrolled in FCS secondary programs, a decrease of 38 percent over a decade.

===Home science in India===
Many Education boards in [[India]] such as [[National Institute of Open Schooling|NIOS]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nios.ac.in/currisylhs-eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[Central Board of Secondary Education|CBSE]], [[Indian Certificate of Secondary Education|ICSE]],&lt;ref&gt;http://cbse.nic.in/examin~1/scheme06ex.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[CISCE]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cisce.org/data/.../27.%20Home%20Science.pdf{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and various state boards offer home science as a subject in their courses.

===United Kingdom===
In the [[UK]], Home Economics was once a [[GCSE]] qualification offered to secondary school pupils, but has since been replaced with a course entitled Food and Nutrition which focuses more on the nutritional side of food to economics.

In [[Scotland]], Home Economics was replaced by Hospitality: Practical Cooking at National 3,4 and 5 level and Health and Food Technology at National 3, 4, 5, Higher and Advanced Higher. The awarding body is the [[Scottish Qualifications Authority|SQA]].

Situated in the human sciences, home economics draws from a range of disciplines to achieve optimal and sustainable living for individuals, families, and [[communities]]. Historically, home economics has been in the context of the [[home]] and [[household]], but this has extended in the 21st century to include the wider living environments as we better understand that the capacities, choices, and priorities of individuals and families impact at all levels, ranging from the household to the local and the global community. Home economists are concerned with promoting and protecting the well-being of individuals, families, and communities; they facilitate the development of attributes for lifelong learning for paid, unpaid, and [[Volunteering|voluntary]] work. Home economics professionals are advocates for individuals, families, and communities.

The content of home economics comes from the synthesis of multiple disciplines. This [[interdisciplinary]] knowledge is essential because the phenomena and challenges of everyday life are not typically one-dimensional. The content of home economics courses vary, but may include: [[food]], [[nutrition]], and [[health]]; personal finance; family resource management and planning; [[textile]]s and [[clothing]]; [[wikt:shelter|shelter]] and housing; [[consumerism]] and [[consumer science]]; household management; design and technology; food science and [[hospitality]]; [[Developmental psychology|human development]] and family studies; communication and extension [[education]] and [[community services]], among others. The capacity to draw from such disciplinary diversity is a strength of the profession, allowing for the development of specific interpretations of the field, as relevant to the context.

===Cleaning===
Home cleaning tasks can be separated into four categories: litter removal, storage of belongings, dusting, and washing of surfaces. Washing of surfaces is the most dangerous and complicated part because of the cleaning solutions. For example, hard water deposits are cleaned with acid solutions and grease is cleaned with alkaline solutions; they can both harm the skin and are reactive toward each other, potentially producing unwanted by-products. Mixing together chlorine bleach and strong acids (e.g. limescale remover containing HCl) forms chlorine gas, which is toxic. Solvents such as [[paint thinner]] and [[rubbing alcohol]] are toxic and flammable. Some disinfectants are toxic. Even dish water can require rubber gloves.

==Professional associations==
The [[American Association of Family and Consumer Sciences|AAFCS (American Association of Family &amp; Consumer Sciences)]] represents teachers, educators, cooperatives, business, designers and nutritionists.The American Association of Family &amp; Consumer Sciences (AAFCS) is the only national forum where K-12 teachers, university educators, and corporate executives collaborate to improve the quality of individual and family life.

The [[Association for Career and Technical Education]] (ACTE) is the largest American national education association dedicated to the advancement of education that prepared youth and adults for successful careers.  ACTE's core purpose is to provide leadership in developing an educated, prepared, and competitive workforce.  The ACTE division of Family and Consumer Sciences Education includes three sections (1) NATFACS - National Association Teachers of Family and Consumer Sciences (2) NATEFACS - National Association Teacher Educators of Family andy Consumer Sciences, andy (3) NASAFACS - National Association State Administrators of Family and Consumer Sciences.

The [[National Council on Family Relations]], (NCFR) founded in 1938, is the oldest multidisciplinary, nonpartisan professional organization focused solely on family research, practice and education. They claim to be the premier professional association for the multidisciplinary understanding of families. The members’ interests—as diverse as their careers and backgrounds—are focused on topics and efforts that yield a common benefit: …understanding and strengthening families. NCFR members are professionals dedicated to understanding and strengthening families. The 3,400-plus members come from more than 35 countries and all 50 U.S. states, and include: researchers, demographers, marriage and family therapists, parent/family educators, university faculty, students, social workers, public health workers, extension specialists and faculty, ECFE teachers, clergy, counselors, K-12 teachers, and more.

[[File:Igor Moiseyev 1961.png|thumb|200px|Igor Moiseyev in 1961]]
'''Igor Alexandrovich Moiseyev''' ({{lang-ru|Игорь Александрович Моисеев}}; {{OldStyleDate|21 January|1906|8 January}} – 2 November 2007) has been widely acclaimed as the greatest 20th-century choreographer of [[character dance]], a dance style similar to [[folk dance]] but with more professionalism and theatrics.

==Life and career==
Born in [[Kiev]], [[Russian Empire]], he was the only child of a [[Russia]]n lawyer and a [[France|French]]-[[Romania]]n seamstress.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.luchmir.com/Iskusstvo/1Moiseev100.htm&lt;/ref&gt; His family lived in Paris until he was 8, and throughout his life he spoke to Western journalists in fluent French.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|author=Jack Anderson|title='Igor Moiseyev, 101, Choreographer, Dies'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/03/arts/dance/03moiseyev.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=3 November 2007|accessdate=21 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moiseyev graduated from the [[Bolshoi Theatre]] [[Russian ballet|ballet]] school in 1924 and danced in the theatre until 1939. His first choreography in the Bolshoi was ''Footballer'' in 1930 and the last was ''[[Spartacus (ballet)|Spartacus]]'' in 1954.

Since the early 1930s, he staged acrobatic [[parade]]s on [[Red Square]] and finally came up with the idea of establishing the Theatre of Folk Art. In 1936, [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] put him in charge of the new dance company, which has since been known as the Moiseyev Ballet. Among about 200 dances he created for his company, some humorously represented the game of [[association football|football]] and [[guerrilla warfare]]. After visiting [[Belarus]] he choreographed a Belarusian "folk" dance [[Bulba]] ("Potato"), which over the years indeed became a Belarusian folk dance. According to the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], Moiseyev's work has been especially admired "for the balance that it maintained between authentic folk dance and theatrical effectiveness".

Moiseyev was named [[People's Artist of the USSR]] in 1953, [[Hero of Socialist Labor]] in 1976, received the [[Lenin Prize]] (1967, for the dance show ''A Road to the Dance''), four [[Stalin Prize|Stalin]]/[[USSR State Prize]]s (1942, 1947, 1952, 1985), [[Russian Federation State Prize]] (1996), was awarded numerous orders and medals of the Soviet Union, Spain and many other countries. On the day of his [[centenary]], Moiseyev became the first Russian to receive [[Order of Merit for the Fatherland]], 1st class — the highest civilian decoration of the [[Russian Federation]]. In 2001, he was awarded the [[UNESCO Mozart Medal]] for outstanding contribution to world music culture. He died in [[Moscow]] on 2 November 2007 aged 101.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3410">'''Informal mathematics''', also called '''naïve mathematics''', has historically been the predominant form of [[mathematics]] at most times and in most cultures, and is the subject of modern [[ethnomathematics|ethno-cultural studies of mathematics]]. The philosopher [[Imre Lakatos]] in his ''[[Proofs and Refutations]]'' aimed to sharpen the formulation of informal mathematics, by reconstructing its role in nineteenth century mathematical debates and concept formation, opposing the predominant assumptions of [[mathematical formalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Imre Lakatos, ''Proofs and Refutations'' (1976), especially the Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt;  Informality may not discern between statements given by ''[[inductive reasoning]]'' (as in [[approximation]]s which are deemed "correct" merely because they are useful), and statements derived by ''[[deductive reasoning]]''.

==Terminology==

''Informal mathematics'' means any informal mathematical practices, as used in everyday life, or by aboriginal or ancient peoples, without historical or geographical limitation. Modern mathematics, exceptionally from that point of view, emphasizes formal and strict [[mathematical proof|proofs]] of all statements from given [[axiom]]s. This can usefully be called therefore ''formal mathematics''. Informal practices are usually understood intuitively and justified with examples—there are no axioms. This is of direct interest in [[anthropology]] and [[psychology]]: it casts light on the perceptions and agreements of other cultures.  It is also of interest in [[developmental psychology]] as it reflects a naïve understanding of the relationships between numbers and things. Another term used for informal mathematics is '''folk mathematics''', which is ambiguous; the [[mathematical folklore]] article is dedicated to the usage of that term among professional mathematicians.

The field of [[naïve physics]] is concerned with similar understandings of physics. People use mathematics and physics in everyday life, without really understanding (or caring) how mathematical and physical ideas were historically derived and justified.

==History==
There has long been a standard account of the development of [[geometry]] in [[ancient Egypt]], followed by [[Greek mathematics]] and the emergence of deductive logic. The modern sense of the term ''mathematics'', as meaning only those systems justified with reference to axioms, is however an [[anachronism]] if read back into history. Several ancient societies built impressive mathematical systems and carried out complex calculations based on proofless [[heuristic]]s and practical approaches. Mathematical facts were accepted on a [[wikt:pragmatic|pragmatic]] basis. [[Empirical method]]s, as in science, provided the justification for a given technique. Commerce, [[engineering]], [[calendar]] creation and the prediction of [[eclipse]]s and [[stellar progression]] were practiced by ancient cultures on at least three continents. N.C. Ghosh included Informal Mathematics in the list of Folk Mathematics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3382">The '''Johannesburg Planetarium''' is a [[planetarium]] owned by the [[University of the Witwatersrand]], located on the University's [[Campuses of the University of the Witwatersrand#East Campus|East Campus]] in [[Braamfontein]], [[Johannesburg]]. It was the first full-sized planetarium in Africa, and the second in the southern hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planetarium.co.za/history.html Johannesburg Planetarium], retrieved 26 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The idea of setting up a planetarium in Johannesburg was first discussed in 1956 when the Festival Committee — which had been instituted to organise the celebrations of Johannesburg's seventieth anniversary — decided to raise the funds necessary to buy and house a [[Zeiss projector|Zeiss planetarium]] to be set up for the celebrations. As there was too little time to obtain a new instrument, it was decided to buy an existing [[planetarium projector]] from Europe.

After lengthy negotiations, the Festival Committee was successful in persuading the [[Parliament of Hamburg|Parliament]] of [[Hamburg]] to sell their [[Hamburg Planetarium|planetarium]]'s projector which had been in use there since 1930. The Hamburg Parliament, however, imposed as its conditions that the planetarium's projector be fully modernised in the [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] factory at [[Oberkochen]], and that Johannesburg would in due course have a new planetarium built for Hamburg. The Hamburg projector was immediately dismantled and moved to Oberkochen for an overhaul, and was in time completely rebuilt.

Soon, the responsibilities of the Festival Committee were taken over by the Johannesburg City Council, which after further negotiations, sold the projector to the University of the Witwatersrand for use as both an academic facility for the instruction of students, and as a public amenity. Plans for a new building to house the projector were first drawn up in 1958, and construction began in 1959. The planetarium finally opened on 12 October 1960.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planetarium.co.za/history.html Johannesburg Planetarium], retrieved 26 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The Johannesburg Planetarium is often consulted by the media, and the public, in order to explain unusual occurrences in the skies over South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mg.co.za/article/2010-11-01-sun-halo-piques-south-africans-interest Mail &amp; Guardian Online], "Sun halo piques South Africans' interest", retrieved 1 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mg.co.za/article/2009-11-22-bright-light-over-johannesburg-meteor-or-prawns Mail &amp; Guardian Online], "Bright light over Johannesburg: Meteor or prawns?", retrieved 1 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the Johannesburg Planetarium celebrated its golden jubilee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mg.co.za/article/2010-10-13-joburg-planetarium-celebrates Mail &amp; Guardian Online], "Jo’burg planetarium celebrates", retrieved 1 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Ash''' (born 29 June 1948) is an [[expatriate]] [[United Kingdom|British]] [[poet]] and [[writer]].

His lifelong interest in [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]] (especially its [[Byzantine architecture|architecture]]) is a major theme which runs through his poetry, fiction and [[Travel literature|travel writing]], along with family friends and the three major cities he has lived in. As well as his books (largely published by [[Carcanet]]), his work has appeared in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Village Voice]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and ''[[Paris Review]]''.

==Life==
John Ash was born in [[Manchester]], [[England]] in 1948, the son of schoolteachers. With a brief break to attend the [[University of Birmingham]] (B.A. 1969) and to take a post-graduation year in Cyprus, he remained in the city of his birth until 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Head |first=Dominic |title=The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English |page=46 |year=2006 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-83179-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the notes to his first book, a sequence titled ''Casino'', Ash remarked that it had grown "out of several years of research for another project - a prose work which was to have been called "The Mauve Book: In Praise of Decadence". He also noted that titles of some sections and the over-all structure had a musical analogy. Musical references continued in the books he published while still in England.

Moving to [[New York City]] in 1985, Ash became associated with the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] of poets and formed a strong and lasting friendship with its leading proponent, [[John Ashbery]]. After stints teaching at the [[University of Iowa]] and the [[University of California, Berkeley]], he moved to [[Istanbul]] in 1996, where he has lived since, first teaching at [[Boğaziçi University]], before moving to [[Kadir Has University]].

During this time several of his books, including ''Selected Works'' and ''To the City'', have appeared in Turkish translations, published by [[Yapi Kredi Publications]], who are affiliated with the bank of the same name. Deluxe editions of ''The Anitolikon'', published in a side-by-side English and Turkish edition by Yapi Kredi, featured illustrations by [[Peter Hristoff]], a noted Turkish artist of Bulgarian Christian origin living in New York.

In a review of ''To The City'', ''[[Poetry Magazine]]'' said that John Ash "could be the best English poet of his generation".&lt;ref name=poetry&gt;[http://www.poetrymagazine.org/books/contributing/37.html Review: In the City] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714124438/http://poetrymagazine.org/books/contributing/37.html |date=14 July 2007 }}, ''[[Poetry Magazine|Poetry]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 he was profiled in ''[[The Economist]]'' in an article by [[Hugh Pope]], himself an author and formerly the ''Wall Street Journal'' correspondent in Istanbul. Pope has suggested that Ash is the leading light in a new "Istanbul School" of English-speaking poets taking their inspiration from the city.&lt;ref name=pope&gt;[http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_RGJSPJD A Byzantine journey], Hugh Pope, ''[[The Economist]]'', 15 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Following ''Byzantine Journey'', and other travel writing, Ash led tours the relevant sites and in 2006 wrote the script for the documentary "Istanbul for Aficionados".&lt;ref&gt;[http://advertisingmarketing.press-base.com/en/ds/195803/Istanbul_s_First_Guidebook_Documentary.html Istanbul's First Guidebook Documentary]&lt;/ref&gt; He has also appeared in a [[BBC]] guide to Istanbul, broadcast in 2005 on BBC Four's "Mediterranean Tales" strand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/books/medtales/destinations/istanbul.shtml Mediterranean Tales: Istanbul]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr '''Kailash Chandra Mishra''' is known as a management teacher, [[orator]], researcher and writer. He relocated from the [[Lal Bahadur Shastri Institute of Management]], Delhi to take over as the first Vice Chancellor of [[Sri Sri University]] in Orissa founded by [[Sri Sri Ravishankar]] with patronage from Government of Odisha. The saga of his institution building is not without hurdles but the final outcome is in the interest of society.

== Books ==

His books include ''The Game is changing: Insurance Reloaded''; ''Insurance Demystified: Reading beyond the lexicon''; ''Medical Informatics: An exploration''; ''Finance for family managed business and Financial Management: In the era of reforms''. He is a newspaper columnist and used to write a column every Saturday in [[DNA (newspaper)|DNA]] – Money – Comments. He has more than three hundred published papers in various national and international management journals. In 2008 he has published eight textbooks through Cengage learning (Previously Thomson learning) in New Delhi. These books include: ''Insurance Business Environment and Insurance Company operations''; ''Life Insurance : Principles &amp; Practice''; ''General Insurance : Principles &amp; Practice''; ''Financial Management &amp; Insurance Accounting''; ''Elements of Actuarial Science''; ''Legal &amp; Regulatory Aspects of Insurance''; ''Basics of Personal Financial Planning''; and ''Life Insurance Underwriting''. Each of these books was coauthored by one of his doctoral students or management associates. He has also published in 2008 two other books through ICFAI Publication, namely "Enjoying IIT-Jee" and Organizational Adaptation – A tag study of General Insurance TAC in India". In April 2011 he gave the ninth Odisha Swaviman Lecture "Orissa Civil Society Begs for a Shake", which was published as an Oriya book by the NGO ''Āma Oḍishā'' in Bhubaneswar.

== Management frameworks ==

He is credited with creating cited management frameworkslike "Mishra's Seven A framework of insurance management", first published in his book ''Insurance Reloaded'' ICFAI Publication, Hyderabad, India, "APES framework for insurance organization", first published in USA, Chamber and Partners' journal ''Mondaq.com'', "Mishra theory of preference dynamics in investment", first cited in his D.Litt. thesis "Mutual Funds in the emerging market", "Seven P framework of underwriting", first published in "Asia Insurance Post, Mumbai, india and "3L framework of retrocession planning", first published in the journal "Bima Quest", Pune, India.

== Extramural innovations ==

In various management schools he has founded, he has introduced some extramurals like BEAD (Business Etics Advancement and Development), MID (Management Intrapreneurship Development), STUDENT (Structuring The Unstructured by Discussion, Evolution, Negotiation and Training), POY (Power of You) and INLAB (Insurance Laboratory). At SPJIMR, ASCI and NIASOM, he introduced the concept of self-audit for management students – where the students takes responsibility for a part of his syllabus, topic, teacher, examination and examiner. Students' participation in management of business school is his avowed ideal. When enquired as to why he has not started any further experimentation at [[Lal Bahadur Shastri Institute of Management]] (LBSIM), of which he was the Director, he has an interesting response. Lal Bahadur Shastri's Himalayan legacy runs at LBSIM. [[Lal Bahadur Shastri]] was known for his simplicity, honesty, integrity and assertiveness. Anyone understanding these values and internalizing the principles as a way of life does not need any further extramurals. At [[Sri Sri University]] he has introduced a concept for management students called ADLOP (Assessment and Development of Leadership and Outreach Potential).

== Academics ==

By qualification he is MSc in [[solid-state physics]] with three gold medals, [[MBA]], CAIIB and Doctor of Literature ([[D.Litt]])in [[Managerial finance|Financial Management]]. In 2001, International Biographer's Association gave him the Best Citizen of India award (he was one of the ten recipients).

He has been a visiting Professor at international universities like [[Columbia University]], [[University of Connecticut]], [[CPCU]] Atlanta, [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania|Wharton]]'s Aresty Business School, [[Yale University]], S P JAIN CENTER OF MANAGEMENT (Dubai &amp; Singapore), and [[Manchester Business School]], among others. He took charge of first whistle blowing Ombudsperson of Mutual Funds at UTI.

He is an expert committee member of EPFO for pension reforms and is also associated with RBI and SEBI in regulatory best practices. This makes him one of the most versatile experts in financial sector of India. As the Director of LBSIM, he also used to oversee other activities associated with Lal Bahadur Shastri Trust, most important of which is Lal Bahadur Shastri Research Centre (LBSRC) undertaking public policy research both at National and international levels. He is engaged in establishing Sri Sri University in Orissa which is declared by the spiritual leader Sri Sri Ravishankar to recreate the ethos of ancient Indian Universities like Nalanda and Rajgiri with Modern teaching learning facilities.

Dr Mishra is from a village called Sriramachandrapur in [[Puri]], a district of [[Orissa, India|Orissa]]. Currently he advises several ministries of the [[Government of India]] and he has advised eight different ministries of the Government of India in the past. His concern for [[Micro finance]] and micro-insurance have been his strongest points apart from professional management education.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12935">'''Lester Horton''' (23 January 1906 – 2 November 1953) was an American [[dancer]], [[choreographer]], and [[teacher]].

==Biography==

===Early years===

Lester Iradell Horton was born in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]] on January 23, 1906. His parents were Iradell and Pollyanna Horton.

His interest in dance was stimulated by his fascination with American Indian culture after watching tribal dances in a [[Wild West show]].  He studied the [[Iroquois]] and [[Red River War|Red River Indians]], and [[Penobscot]] and [[Ojibwa]] tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Dorathi Bock Pierre, "From Primitive to Modern," American Dancer (October, 1937), p.36&lt;/ref&gt;

He studied ballet for two years with a local teacher in Indianapolis, Theo Hewes.&lt;ref name=Prevots-2012&gt;{{cite web|last1=Prevots|first1=Naimi|title=Lester Horton (1906-1953)|url=http://www.danceheritage.org/treasures/horton_essay_prevots.pdf |website=www.danceheritage.org|publisher=Dance Heritage Coalition|accessdate=21 February 2015|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At that time he also took classes at the [[Herron School of Art and Design|Herron Art Institute]] and worked with the [[Indianapolis Little Theater]].

Seeing a performance of the [[Denishawn School of Dancing and Related Arts|Denishawn company]] had a great impact on him.

Horton arrived in California in 1929 to perform ''The Song of Hiawatha'', a dance-pageant by [[Clara Bates]] based on [[The Song of Hiawatha|Longfellow's poem]], at the Argus Bowl, a natural amphitheater in [[Eagle Rock, Los Angeles|Eagle Rock]].&lt;ref name=Prevots-2012/&gt;

He took a job with the sculptress [[Kathleen Stubergh]], with whom he remained close for his lifetime.  They produced [[Wax sculpture|wax figures]] and Horton painted faces on the window mannequins.&lt;ref name="Warren, Larry 1967"&gt;Warren, Larry. Dance Perspectives 31 Autumn, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

He chose to work in California instead of New York City, which was considered the center of modern dance at the time.

===Career===
In 1931, Horton created his first solo concert choreography, ''Kootenai War Dance''. That same year he was invited to perform this dance along with a new choreography ''Voodoo Ceremonial'' at the Los Angeles Olympics. His success garnered an invitation to perform at the Paramount Theatre on the same bill as Judy Garland and the Garland sisters for a two-week run.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.danceheritage.org/treasures/horton_essay_prevots.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, Lester Horton formed his own dance company called the Lester Horton Dancers. That company evolved into what was briefly known as the Lester Horton California Ballets (1934) and then the Horton Dance Group (1934).  The Horton Dance Group, billed in its film appearances as the Lester Horton Dancers, lasted until early 1944. Later, Horton attempted to develop a company on the East Coast for dancer Sonia Shaw, but Shaw's husband stopped underwriting the venture and the company collapsed before it could give any public performances.&lt;ref&gt;Larry Warren, "Starting from Indiana," ''Dance Perspectives'' 31 (Autumn 1967): 7, 13, 18.&lt;/ref&gt; After a brief hiatus, Horton formed the Dance Theater of Los Angeles with his longtime leading dancer, [[Bella Lewitzky]]; their partnership ended when Lewitzky left in 1950. Horton's final company continued until 1960 under the direction of Frank Eng.

In order to finance his school and various dance companies, Horton choreographed a number of Hollywood musicals, beginning with ''Moonlight in Havana'' (1942).  Many of the films, like the [[Maria Montez]] vehicle ''[[White Savage]]'' (1943), were Universal productions, which could not rival the budgetary extravagance of MGM or Fox, though many were in Technicolor; the most notable was Arthur Lubin's ''[[Phantom of the Opera (1943 film)|Phantom of the Opera]]'' (1943). Horton's dancers also frequently worked at clubs, including the Folies Bergère in New York and [[Earl Carroll Theatre]] and Restaurant in [[Los Angeles]]. Horton's best-known works, which he called "choreodramas," are ''Salome'' (which occupied Horton for nearly two decades&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bizot, "Lester Horton's "Salome", 1934-1953 and After," ''Dance Research Journal'' 16.1 (1984): 35.&lt;/ref&gt;) and ''The Beloved''.

Dance Theater made only one appearance in New York, during the last year of Horton's life. The troupe was scheduled to perform at the reputation-making theater of the Young Men's and young Women's Hebrew Association on East Ninety-second street in New York City. Upon arriving the troupe discovered the venue did not provide publicity and so the performance was largely unknown and not well attended. Only about 300 people showed for the Saturday night performance and only about 200 tickets were sold for the Sunday matinee. This netted the company a total of 100 dollars. All but one of the reviews were good.&lt;ref name="Jennifer Dunning 1996"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Alvin Ailey: A Life In Dance&lt;/u&gt;, Jennifer Dunning,(1996): 64.&lt;/ref&gt; One magazine praised the "superb dancers" but complained that "one technical and effective stunt follows another with hardly ever any sustained choreographic continuity."&lt;ref&gt;"Lester Horton Dance Theatre," ''Dance Observer'' 20.4 (June–July 1953): 89.&lt;/ref&gt;  There was not enough money to return home from New York and Horton had doubts about the company's financial ability to attend [[Jacob's Pillow]] later that summer. Horton's agent wired Horton the money to get the troupe home. At the time, Horton was drinking heavily and was emotionally and physically ill. Upon returning to Los Angeles he moved into a house on Mulholland Drive where he was attended to by his parents and friends.

Determined to perform at the Jacob's Pillow festival, the group travelled to the Berkshires by car. The show was a success, though Horton could not afford to accompany the troupe to the festival.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;u&gt;Alvin Ailey: A Life In Dance&lt;/u&gt;, Jennifer Dunning,(1996): 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Riding on their success at the festival, the troupe was asked to open for [[Johnny Desmond]] in the Fall; they were so popular that they were invited back for another two-week engagement. Horton died of a heart attack at his home on November 2, 1953.&lt;ref name="Jennifer Dunning 1996"/&gt; Alvin Ailey briefly ran the company following Horton's death, but eventually moved to New York City, where in 1969 the Horton Technique became standard training for students at the Alvin Ailey American Dance Center

Since Horton's death, his dance technique and choreography have become widely known and practiced. Horton's legacy has survived through the [http://www.lhdt.org www.lhdt.org Lester Horton Dance Theater Foundation, Inc.], which is dedicated to preserving and promoting Horton's contributions as a dancer, choreographer, and educator. Also, various dance companies such as the [[Joyce Trisler Danscompany]] focus on Horton's technique,",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danscompany.com/ Joyce Trisler Danscompany] Accessed 1-5-2008.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre and School.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.alvinailey.org/alvin-ailey-american-dance-theater/lester-horton&lt;/ref&gt;

Horton choreographed the following films:&lt;ref name="Warren, Larry 1967"/&gt;
* [[Moonlight in Havana]], 1942 (Universal Pictures)
* [[Rhythm of the Islands]], 1943 (Universal Pictures)
* [[White Savage]], 1943 (Universal Pictures)
* [[Phantom of the Opera (1943 film)|Phantom of the Opera]], 1943 (Universal Pictures)
* [[The Climax]], 1944 (Universal Pictures) 
* [[Salome, Where She Danced]], 1945 (Universal Pictures)
* [[That Night With You]], 1945 (Universal Pictures)
* [[Frisco Sal]], 1945 (Universal Pictures)
* [[Shady Lady (1945 film)|Shady Lady]], 1945 (Universal Pictures)
* [[Tangier (1946 film)|Tangier]], 1946 (Universal Pictures)
* [[Siren of Atlantis]], 1948 (United Artists Release)
* [[Bagdad (film)|Bagdad]], 1949 (Universal-International)
* [[South Sea Woman]], 1953 (Warner Brothers)
* [[3-D Follies]], 1953 (R.K.O)

Horton trained a number of significant mid-twentieth century dancers:

* [[Alvin Ailey]]
* [[Eleanor Brooks]]
* [[Janet Collins]]
* [[Rudi Gernreich]]
* [[Carmen de Lavallade]]
* [[Bella Lewitzky]]
* [[James Mitchell (actor)|James Mitchell]]
* [[Carl Ratcliff]]
* [[Jeri Faubion Salkin]]
* [[Joyce Trisler]]
* [[James Truitte]]
* [[William Dale Jennings]]

Other figures who emerged from Horton's school and company include actress [[Lelia Goldoni]] and [[Sondra Kerr Blake]]. The founder of the Mattachine Society, [[Harry Hay]], had a daughter who took classes at the dance theater. Janet Collins, a twenty year old ballet student (who would go on to be the first African American dancer to perform full-time with the Metropolitan Opera in New York) was one of the students approached by Horton to perform in exchange for free classes. Collins enthusiastically agreed, and yet admitted to Horton that she knew "nothing about modern dance." Horton told her not to worry—he would teach her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Lorin|date=2014-10-27|title=Degrees of Separation: Lester Horton's|url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/2211730x-12341259|journal=Experiment|language=en|volume=20|issue=1|pages=48–85|doi=10.1163/2211730x-12341259|issn=2211-730X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technique==
Horton developed his own approach to dance that incorporated diverse elements including Native American Folk Dance, Japanese arm gestures, Javanese and Balinese isolations for the upper body, particularly the eyes, head and hands. Horton also included Afro-Caribbean elements, like hip circles.

[[File:Horton in Hungary.webm|thumb|right|Contemporary stretching based on Horton Technique]]

Horton's dance technique, which is now commonly known as ''Horton Technique'', has no style, per se.  The technique emphasizes a whole body, anatomical approach to dance that includes flexibility, strength, coordination and body and spatial awareness to enable unrestricted, dramatic freedom of expression.

"I am sincerely trying now to create a dance technique based entirely upon corrective exercises, created with a  knowledge of human anatomy; a technique which will correct physical faults and prepare a dancer for any type of dancing he may wish to follow; a technique having all the basic movements which govern the actions of the body; combined with a knowledge of the origin of movement and a sense of artistic design."
-Lester Horton, in a letter to Dorathi Bock Pierre, "From Primitive to Modern," American Dancer (October 1937)&lt;ref name="Warren, Larry 1967"/&gt;

Margaret Wynne was born in [[Adrian, Michigan]], July 14, 1847. She was a daughter of John and Jane Meehan Wynne,{{sfn|Logan|1912|p=836}} both Irish Catholics.{{sfn|Curtis|Elder|1911|p=359}} She passed her childhood and youth in Adrian.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=452}}

She was educated in the public schools of Adrian, receiving in the [[Adrian High School (Michigan)|Adrian High School]] a full collegiate classical and mathematical course modeled after the Amherat plan, attaining at an early age great proficiency, especially in the classics, Latin and Greek, and graduating when fourteen years old.{{sfn|Curtis|Elder|1911|p=359}} Up to that time, she had shown no especial literary taste, but when she went back to her alma mater to take a post-graduate course, she intermingled with her studies a rhymed translation of the first of the ''[[Satires (Horace)|Satires]] of [[Horace]]''.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=452}}

==Career==
After graduating from school she taught for several years.{{sfn|Logan|1912|p=836}} In 1873, she married Dr. James Thomas Lawless (1844–1932), a practicing physician in [[Toledo, Ohio]]. They made their home in Toledo, and had eight sons.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=452}}

She began writing poetry in 1886,{{sfn|Curtis|Elder|1911|p=359}} sending poems and fiction to [[Eastern United States|eastern]] magazines, where they found ready acceptance and fair remuneration. A few years passed away, and then a nearly mortal illness forced her to give up writing, as she supposed, forever.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=452}}

After several years of raising a family, she again set forth her work as a writer, this time with a clearer perception of the meaning of life, with a better understanding of her own powers, and with higher purposes. Before, she wrote for the mere pleasure of writing, with her later writings there was a message for her to deliver, and it came most readily and clearly in lines glowing with poetic fervor.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=452}}

Lawless was not a prolific writer, but her name was not a stranger in many of the leading magazines and papers of the country in her time, such as  ''The Catholic World'', ''Ave Maria'', ''Rosary Magazine'', ''Pilot'', ''New World'', ''Catholic Universe'' (of which she conducted the Children's Dept. for a number of years), as well as to the following secular publications, ''Our Youth'', ''Frank Leslie's Weekly'', ''Weekly Wisconsin'', ''Demorest's'', ''American Magazine'', ''Lippincott's'', ''Golden Days'', ''Detroit Free Press'', and ''Traveler's Record''. She never published a book of her poems, but was engaged in compiling her writings with that end in view.{{sfn|Curtis|Elder|1911|p=359}}{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=452}} Both she and her husband were active workers in the cause of Catholic education and the development of Catholic charitable, literary and socialistic societies and institutions. Lawless incorporated and took out a charter for the Catholic Ladies of Ohio, the first insurance and benevolent society for women in the United States, and was for six years secretary of this organization.{{sfn|Logan|1912|p=836}}

Lawless died January 18, 1926, in Toledo, and was buried in that town's Calvary Cemetery.

'''Marta Russo''' was a 22-year-old student at the Faculty of [[Law]] at the [[Sapienza University of Rome]], who was killed within the University grounds. Her death was the centre of a complex court case that garnered huge media attention owing to the lack of substantial evidence and motive. 

After a six-years-long trial Giovanni Scattone was found guilty of [[involuntary manslaughter]], and Salvatore Ferraro was declared responsible for aiding and abetting. Other accused man, Francesco Liparota, was acquitted, then convicted in appeal, and then dismissed by all allegations.

==Description==
On 9 May 1997, at about 11:42, a 0.22 calibre bullet hit Marta Russo while she walked with a friend on the university's grounds, in a driveway located between the faculties of Statistical Sciences, Law and Political Science. The girl was transported to the nearby Policlinico Umberto I, but she died on 14 May without regaining consciousness.&lt;ref name="perfect_crime"&gt;Kennedy, Frances. [https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/a-perfect-crime-killer-on-campus-1083374.html "A perfect crime: Killer on campus"], ''[[The Independent]]'', 1999-03-27. Retrieved on 2009-07-08.&lt;/ref&gt; Parents donated the organs, respecting Marta's desire expressed a few years, speaking about the death of [[Nicholas Green]].

Forensic tests showed traces of gunpowder on the sill of a window on the second floor, a reading room in the legal philosophy department. Afterwards (1998), a forensic expert established that such residues were not gunpowder but residual pollution. 

The circle tightened around the 25 or so people who often used the room to consult textbooks or use computers. Telephone records identified one person, Maria Chiara Lipari, daughter of a professor, that indicated after many uncertainties the presence of a secretary, Gabriella Alletto, and other people. After an interrogation threatened to be arrested for voluntary murder, Gabriella Alletto, after conflicting testimony, implicated Giovanni Scattone, age 29, and Salvatore Ferraro, age 30, who were junior lecturers in the legal philosophy department of Rome's La Sapienza University, and Francesco Liparota, usher and graduate in law. Neither had a criminal record nor a reason to murder Ms. Russo. The woman accused also professor Bruno Romano of reticence, then he defended by well-known lawyers Franco Coppi and [[Giulia Bongiorno]] (future lawyer of [[Amanda Knox]]'s former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, in the case of [[murder of Meredith Kercher]]).

Then, a videotape with the interrogation, recorded by secret services, came out, showing the stages of interrogation and presence of Alletto's brother-in-law (a policeman), who told her she should have accused some suspects, even though "maybe she did not see it materially" the scene of shooting, because "it's best to let them do the crime". The recording also showed the prosecutors warning her, saying "You are guilty of murder" and "you will never again come out of prison".

Prime minister [[Romano Prodi]] criticized these facts and describes as "very serious matter" the behaviour of two prosecutors, Mr. Italo Ormanni e and Mr. Carlo Lasperanza. Even [[Silvio Berlusconi]]'s opposition attacks the prosecutors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/1998/sep/21/2|title=Murder mystery puts Italian prosecutors in the dock|date=1998-09-21|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian public has been divided on the guilt of the accused. Some famous personalities (like judge of [[Aldo Moro kidnapping]] [[Ferdinando Imposimato]], politician [[Marco Pannella]] ad journalist [[Paolo Mieli]]) claim the innocence of Scattone and Ferraro and publicy defend them. The trial, which, lasted over a year, followed by long appeals, involved investigations into prosecutorial misconduct and possible threatening of witnesses, and questioning the credibility of the main witnesses for the prosecution. Criminal court of [[Perugia]], howewer, absolved the prosecutors from the accusation of abuse of office, threat and private violence against Gabriella Alletto.

==Motive==
Police could not find an ordinary [[Motive (law)|motive]] for killing Russo. She had no history of drug abuse, no outspoken political or religious convictions and no jilted lovers in her past. Instead, they proposed the intellectual challenge of committing a perfect murder, a crime for which one could not be prosecuted partly because of its apparent lack of motive.

The media seemed to focus on the possibility that the killing had been a dare about committing a "[[perfect crime]]", or that it was a [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzschean]] compulsion to be a [[Übermensch]], a [[Raskolnikov]] figure. 

This motive was denied by the accused, and no proof of this has founded, so the court will condemn them with light sentences of only involuntary manslaughter. According to the judgment, Scattone had a pistol in his hand for unknown reasons, and accidentally took a shot. With panic, Scattone and Ferraro would run away and then hide the weapon.

Some alternative paths were discarded, including the one involving a [[Red Brigades]] member (May 9th was the anniversary of murder of [[Aldo Moro]] in 1978) discovered in 2003, the possible organized criminality's involvement (person exchange) and the path of some university and cleaning firms  employees and workers, that have the passion for firearms and handmaded silencers and shell casings.

==Media attention==
The case gained huge attention in the media, owing to the apparent indiscriminate nature in which the victim was targeted.&lt;ref name="italy_gripped"&gt;Hooper, John. [https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/feb/13/johnhooper "Case of the perfect pointless murder grips Italy"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 1999-02-13. Retrieved on 2009-07-08.&lt;/ref&gt; The public was so interested that court proceedings were broadcast live on radio. Campus killings were unheard of in Italy, leading to parents of students being so scared for their children that they insisted on them wearing motorcycle helmets while outside.&lt;ref name="perfect_crime" /&gt; More than 10,000 students attended Russo's funeral, joined by the Prime Minister Prodi, the Italian President [[Oscar Luigi Scalfaro]] and other dignitaries. The [[Pope John Paul II]] sent a message of condolence.

Academics were banned from speaking directly to the press.&lt;ref name="gagging"&gt;THES Editorial. [http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=103245&amp;sectioncode=26 "Gagging order sticks in academic craw"], ''[[Times Higher Education|Times Higher Education Supplement]]'', 1997-08-08. Retrieved on 2009-07-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial==
The trial began in June 1998; some neutral forensics affirmed during the trial the innocence of Scattone and Ferraro, arguing that the shot was fired from the ground floor, while Liparota revealed that he was threatened by the police to accuse his colleagues; initially confirm the allegations, then retracted by saying that he had not seen anything. There was a precise telephone bill that, combined with other testimonial reports also, denied many details of the story of Maria Chiara Lipari and indirectly the allegations of Alletto.

Finally, the public prosecutor's office demanded a 18-year prison sentence for [[Murder (Italian law)|voluntary murder]], with mitigating effects as no premeditation would have been made, but it would have been possible ("dolo eventuale", in Italian "eventual malice", a less serious case of murder). In December both defendants had been released and placed in house arrest until judgment. 

In June 1999, jury rejected the attorney's requests and Giovanni Scattone was convicted of [[involuntary manslaughter]] of Russo, caused by his [[criminal negligence]] or [[carelessness]] (Italian "colpa cosciente" which can be translated as ''conscious fault''), and Salvatore Ferraro was convicted of aiding and abetting Scattone.&lt;ref name="conviction"&gt;Kennedy, Frances. [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/it-was-the-perfect-crime-so-who-made-the-fatal-error-1098843.html "It was the perfect crime. So who made the fatal error?"], ''[[The Independent]]'', 1999-06-08. Retrieved on 2009-07-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a confirming appeal (2001), surprisingly at request of another prosecutor, Court's Attorney General Vincenzo Geraci, the verdict was annulled by the Supreme Court of Cassation for lack of evidence (December 2001); a new appeal reiterated the conviction (2002), then confirmed definitively in 2003 (finally, the punishment consisted to 5 years and four months of prison for Giovanni Scattone, 4 years and two months to Salvatore Ferraro). Scattone and Ferraro have always claimed to be innocent, and to have been stuck with outright testimony. Instead, the supreme court dismissed Francesco Liparota (overturning his previously conviction for complicity) - because he was not punishable at the time, according to the judges he would have covered the shot because he was too scared - and, previously, acquitted even Bruno Romano.

After a penalty discount, Scattone ended up serving the sentence in prison (2003-2004) and to [[house arrest]] until 2005; later, having the court granted him the complete legal criminal rehabilitation, eliminating perpetual interdictions from public offices, he became a high school professor of philosophy until 2015, when he got regular work of psychology teacher, but resigned following the controversy by press and Russo family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2015/09/10/giovanni-scattone-rinuncia-alla-cattedra-il-docente-condannato-per-lomicidio-marta-russo/2023865/ Giovanni Scattone, rinuncia alla cattedra il docente condannato per l’omicidio Marta Russo] (italian)&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote some essays and translations; in 2001, Scattone married [[Cinzia Giorgio]], writer and scriptwriter. Salvatore Ferraro devoted himself to political activism and to the activity of lawyer and bookseller. Scattone and Ferraro were also sentenced to civil compensation of 1 million euro to Marta Russo's parents and sister (2011).

'''Nancy Colbert Friday''' (August 27, 1933 – November 5, 2017) was an American author who wrote on the topics of [[female sexuality]] and liberation.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/05/obituaries/nancy-friday-84-best-selling-student-of-gender-politics-dies.html |title=Nancy Friday, 84, Best-Selling Student of Gender Politics, Dies |last=Gates |first=Anita |date=2017-11-05 |website=The New York Times |language=en-US |access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her writings argue that women have often been reared under an ideal of [[woman]]hood, which was outdated and restrictive, and largely unrepresentative of many women's true inner lives, and that openness about women's hidden lives could help free women to truly feel able to enjoy being themselves. She asserts that this is not due to deliberate malice, but due to [[Group dynamics|social expectation]], and that for women's and men's benefit alike it is healthier that both be able to be equally open, participatory and free to be accepted for who and what they are.

==Biography==

Nancy Friday was born in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], the daughter of Walter F. Friday and Jane Colbert Friday (later Scott&lt;ref&gt;http://fultonhistory.com/newspaper%208/Niagara%20Falls%20NY%20Gazette/Niagara%20Falls%20NY%20Gazette%201948%20may-Jun%20Grayscale/Niagara%20Falls%20NY%20Gazette%201948%20may-Jun%20Grayscale%20-%200099.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;). She grew up in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], and attended the only local girls' college-preparatory school, [[Ashley Hall (school)|Ashley Hall]], where she graduated in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Thompson | first = Bill | title = Alumna Humphreys to read from work | work = [[The Post and Courier]] | location = Charleston, South Carolina | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110807080201/http://www.ashleyhall.org/common/news_detail.asp?newsid=510499&amp;L1=3&amp;L2=1 | archive-date = August 7, 2011 | url = http://www.ashleyhall.org/common/news_detail.asp?newsid=510499&amp;L1=3&amp;L2=1 | date = February 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She then attended [[Wellesley College]] in [[Massachusetts]], where she graduated in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Rowes | first = Barbara | title = Author Nancy Friday explains why men's sexual fantasies are different from women's | url = http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20076858,00.html | work = [[People (magazine)|People]] | publisher = [[Time Inc.]] | date = June 30, 1980 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She worked briefly as a reporter for the ''[[San Juan Island Times]]'' and subsequently established herself as a magazine journalist in [[New York City|New York]], [[England]], and [[France]] before turning to writing full-time.

Her first book, published in 1973, was ''[[My Secret Garden]]'', a compilation of her interviews with women discussing their sexuality and fantasies, which became a [[bestseller]]. Friday regularly returned to the interview format in her subsequent books on themes ranging from mothers and daughters to [[sexual fantasies]], [[loving relationship|relationships]], [[jealousy]], [[envy]], [[feminism]], [[BDSM]], and [[beauty]]. After the publication of ''The Power of Beauty'' (released in 1996, and then renamed and re-released in paperback form in 1999), she wrote little, contributing an interview of porn star [[Nina Hartley]] to ''XXX: 30 Porn Star Portraits'', a book published in 2004 by photographer [[Timothy Greenfield-Sanders]], with her final book being ''Beyond My Control: Forbidden Fantasies in an Uncensored Age'', published in 2009.

Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s she was a frequent guest on television and radio programs such as ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'', ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show|Oprah]]'', ''[[Larry King Live]]'', ''[[Good Morning America]]'', and [[NPR]]'s ''[[Talk of the Nation]]''. She also created a website in the mid-1990s, to complement the publication of ''The Power of Beauty.'' Initially conceived as a forum for the development of new work and interaction with her diverse audience, it was not updated in later years.

Despite the judgment of [[Ms. magazine|''Ms.'' magazine]] ("This woman is not a [[feminist]]"),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Friday | first = Nancy | contribution = Introduction | editor-last = Friday | editor-first = Nancy | title = My secret garden: women's sexual fantasies | page = xvi | publisher = Pocket Books | location = New York | year = 2008 | isbn = 9781416567011 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=8vf0sCEdnssC&amp;pg=PR16 Details.]
:''Quote:''
::When I sat down to write this book, I thought the feminists would embrace it. I didn't realize that it was unwelcome at Feminist Headquarters until a former friend turned editor at ''Ms.'' magazine, gave me a rap on the knuckles, proclaiming that "''Ms.'' will decide what women's fantasies are." Soon after, a review in that magazine followed with the opening line "...this woman is not a feminist."&lt;/ref&gt; she predicated her career on the belief that [[feminism]] and the appreciation of men are not mutually exclusive concepts.

==Literary motivation==

Friday explained how "in the late 1960s I chose to write about women's sexual fantasies because the subject was unbroken ground, a missing piece of the puzzle ... at a time in history when the world was suddenly curious about sex and women's sexuality."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Friday | first = Nancy | contribution = Report from the erotic interior | editor-last = Friday | editor-first = Nancy | title = Women on top: how real life has changed women's sexual fantasies | pages = 6–7 | publisher = Pocket Star Books | location = New York Toronto | year = 1991 | isbn = 9780795335259 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The backdrop was a widespread belief that "women do not have sexual fantasies ... are by and large destitute of sexual fantasy."&lt;ref&gt;[[Allan Fromme]], quoted in Friday, ''Top'' p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Friday considered that "more than any other emotion, guilt determined the story lines of the fantasies in ''My Secret Garden'' . . . women inventing ploys to get past their fear that wanting to reach orgasm made them Bad Girls."&lt;ref&gt;Friday, ''Top'' p. 4-5&lt;/ref&gt; Her later book, ''My Mother/My Self,'' 'grew immediately out of ''My Secret Garden'' 's questioning of the source of women's terrible guilt about sex."&lt;ref name="Friday, Top p. 8"&gt;Friday, ''Top'' p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

When she returned 20 years later to her original topic of women's fantasies in ''Women on Top,'' it was in the belief that "the sexual revolution" had stalled: "it was the greed of the 1980s that dealt the death blow . . . the demise of healthy sexual curiosity."&lt;ref&gt;Friday, ''Top'' p. 11-13&lt;/ref&gt;

Friday, like other feminists, was especially concerned with the controlling role of the images of "Nice Woman . . . Nice Girl"&lt;ref&gt;Friday, ''Top'' p. 20-22&lt;/ref&gt;—of being "bombarded from birth with messages about what a 'good woman' is . . . focused so hard and so long on never giving in to 'selfishness.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Johnson | first = Sonia | author-link = Sonia Johnson | contribution = Introduction to Sonia Johnson | editor-last1 = Foss | editor-first1 = Karen A. | editor-last2 = Foss | editor-first2 = Sonja K. | editor-last3 = Griffin | editor-first3 = Cindy L. | title = Readings in feminist rhetorical theory | page = 297 | publisher = Waveland Press | location = Long Grove, Illinois | year = 2006 | isbn = 9781577664970 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as feminism itself developed "a stunning array of customs, opinions, moral values, and beliefs about how the world of women . . . should conduct itself,"&lt;ref&gt;[[Paula Gunn Allen]], Introduction to Paula Gunn Allen in ''Readings'' p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; so too it ran into the difficulty of moralism versus human nature—the fact that "feminism—any political philosophy—does not adequately address sexual [[psychology]]" eventually sparking the '[[Feminist Sex Wars|feminist "sex wars"]] . . . from the early 1980s"&lt;ref&gt;Bright, p. 382 and p. 379&lt;/ref&gt; onwards. Against that backdrop, Friday's evidential and empirical concerns continue to address the "open question of how many of their sexual freedoms the young women . . . will retain, how deeply they have incorporated them."&lt;ref&gt;Friday, ''Top'' p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===

"Critics have labeled Friday's books unscientific, because the author solicited responses,"&lt;ref name="Sova"&gt;{{citation | last = Sova | first = Dawn B. | contribution = Biographical profiles: Friday, Nancy (1937- ) | editor-last = Sova | editor-first = Dawn B. | title = Literature suppressed on sexual grounds | pages = 281–282 | publisher = Facts On File | location = New York | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780816062720 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8VAIbXY8rUUC&amp;pg=PA281 Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt; thus potentially biasing the contributor pool.

''My Secret Garden'' was greeted by a "salvo from the media accusing me of inventing the whole book, having made up all the fantasies"; ''My Mother/My Self'' was "initially . . . violently rejected by both publishers and readers";&lt;ref name="Friday, Top p. 8"/&gt; while ''Women on Top'' "was heavily criticized for its graphic and sensational content."&lt;ref name="Sova" /&gt;

Friday was also criticized for her reaction to the [[Bill Clinton]]/[[Monica Lewinsky]] affair, which critics interpreted as sexist. The journalist [[Jon Ronson]] wrote, "In February 1998, the feminist writer Nancy Friday was asked by the ''[[New York Observer]]'' to speculate on Lewinsky's future. 'I want to rent out my mouth for two bits an hour wink wink,' she replied."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Ronson | first = Jon | author-link = Jon Ronson | title = Monica Lewinsky: 'The shame sticks to you like tar' | url =  https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/16/monica-lewinsky-shame-sticks-like-tar-jon-ronson | work = [[The Guardian]] | date = April 22, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Friday married novelist Bill Manville in 1967, separated from him in 1980, and divorced him in 1986. Her second husband was [[Norman Pearlstine]], formerly the editor in chief of [[Time Inc.]]. They were married at the [[Rainbow Room]] in New York City on July 11, 1988, and divorced in 2005.

In 2011, Friday sold her home in [[Key West, Florida|Key West]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Keith | first = June | title = Nancy Friday's Saturday Sale (blog) | url = http://juneinparadise.blogspot.com/2011/06/nancy-fridays-saturday-sale.html | website = juneinparadise.blogspot.com | publisher = June Keith via [[Blogspot]] | date = June 9, 2011 }} {{Self published inline|date = February 2017|certain = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and moved to [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = 	About the Participants, "The Memoir", January 13-16, 2000, Nancy Friday | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070811022621/http://www.keywestliteraryseminar.org/memoir/bios/friday.htm | archive-date = August 11, 2007 | url = http://www.keywestliteraryseminar.org/memoir/bios/friday.htm | website = keywestliteraryseminar.org | publisher = Key West Literary Seminar }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The institution was founded on September 18, 1935 as the '''Norfolk Unit of [[Virginia Union University]]'''.&lt;ref name="AboutNSU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsu.edu/about/ |title=About Norfolk State |accessdate=2008-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071230183917/http://www.nsu.edu/about/ |archivedate=2007-12-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eighty-five students attended the first classes held in 1935. Mr. Samuel Fischer Scott, an alumnus of Virginia Union and [[Portsmouth, Virginia|Portsmouth]] native, served as the first director with the primary focus of maintaining the solvency of the school. Dr. Lyman Beecher Brooks, a Virginia Union alumnus, succeeded Mr. Scott as director in 1938, and served as provost, 1963–1969, and the first president 1969–1975.

In 1942, the school became independent of VSU and was named '''Norfolk Polytechnic College'''.&lt;ref name="AboutNSU" /&gt;  Within two years, by an act of the Virginia Legislature, it became a part of Virginia State College (now [[Virginia State University]]).&lt;ref name="AboutNSU" /&gt;  By 1950, the 15th anniversary of the college founding, the faculty had grown to fifty and the student enrollment to 1,018. In 1952, the college's athletic teams adopted the "Spartan" name and identity.

The [[Norfolk, Virginia|City of Norfolk]] provided a permanent site for the college on Corprew Avenue, and in 1955 Brown Hall, formerly Tidewater Hall, opened as the first permanent building on the new campus. In 1956 the future Norfolk State College granted its first bachelor's degrees.

In 1969, the college divided from Virginia State College and was named '''Norfolk State College'''. The college was issued accreditation from the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] the same year with an enrollment of 5,400 students. In 1975 and the year following, the first master's degrees were awarded in Communications and Social Work, respectively. Dr. Harrison Benjamin Wilson, Jr., in 1975, succeeded Dr. Lyman Beecher Brooks as President after 37 years.

When the college was granted university status in 1979 by the [[General Assembly of Virginia]], it changed its name to Norfolk State University.

Norfolk State University celebrated its 50th anniversary in 1985 with a year of observances and with an enrollment of 7,200. In 1995 Norfolk State University's enrollment reached 9,112.

Upon the retirement of Dr. Harrison Benjamin Wilson in 1997, Dr. Marie Valentine McDemmond, became NSU's third President in 1997 and served until her retirement. Dr. Alvin J. Schexnider became interim president in July 2005. [[Carolyn Meyers|Dr. Carolyn Winstead Meyers]] was selected as the fourth President and began service on July 1, 2006. [[Tony Atwater|Dr. Tony Atwater]] was announced as the new president in 2011 becoming the fifth president and served until he was removed by the board of visitors of Norfolk State University on August 23, 2013. Dr. Sandra DeLoatch the Provost and President of Academic Affairs was named acting president effective.&lt;ref name="Norfolk State President Atwater Fired"&gt;{{cite web|title=Norfolk State board fires President Tony Atwater|url=http://hamptonroads.com/2013/08/norfolk-state-board-fires-president-tony-atwater|work=Virginian Pilot|accessdate=24 August 2013|author=Denise M.

In December 2013, the university was placed on probation by its [[Regional accreditation|regional accreditor]], the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]], for "financial and governance issues."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2013/12/11/southern-accreditor-clears-virginia-fisk-florida-am |title=Southern Accreditor Clears Virginia, Fisk, Florida A&amp;M |publisher=[[Inside Higher Ed]] |date=December 11, 2013 |accessdate=December 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The probation was lifted two years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2015/12/10/southern-accreditor-places-tennessee-martin-probation |title=Southern Accreditor Places Tennessee-Martin on Probation  |publisher=[[Inside Higher Ed]] |date=December 10, 2015 |accessdate=December 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eddie Moore, Jr. became the 6th president of Norfolk State University on January 10, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = NSU finalizes contract with former interim president|url = http://wavy.com/2016/01/11/nsu-finalizes-contract-with-former-interim-president/|website = WAVY-TV|access-date = 2016-01-11|first = Kevin|last = Green}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon President Moore announcing his retirement in late September 2017 the NSU board of visitors named Dr. Melvin Stith as interim president. He will assume office on January 1, 2018.

{{see also|Norfolk State Spartans}}
Norfolk State sports teams participate in NCAA Division I ([[Division I (NCAA)#Division I-Championship Subdivision|Football Championship Subdivision]] for all sports including [[Norfolk State Spartans football|football]]) in the [[Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference]] (MEAC). Norfolk State was formerly a member of the Eastern Intercollegiate Conference (1953–1960) and the [[Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association]] (1962–1996).&lt;ref name="CFDW"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_iaa/mideastern/norfolk_state/index.php|title=College Football Data Warehouse: Norfolk State Historical Data|accessdate=2008-01-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104014651/http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_iaa/mideastern/norfolk_state/index.php|archive-date=2007-11-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2011–12 Norfolk State Spartans men's basketball team]] won the [[2012 MEAC Men's Basketball Tournament]] championship which gave them the conference's automatic bid in the [[2012 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]], the school's first ever appearance in the tournament. The Spartans, a 15 seed, defeated the #2 seeded Missouri Tigers in the second round, 86-84. This victory was only the fifth time in NCAA Tournament history that a 15 seed defeated a 2 seed, with the last coming in 2001 by MEAC in-state rival Hampton.&lt;ref name="ESPN"&gt;[http://espn.go.com/blog/collegebasketballnation/post/_/id/54317/who-are-the-norfolk-state-spartans] ESPN&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hamptonroads.com/2012/03/norfolk-state-upsets-missouri-8684-ncaa-tourney | title=Norfolk State upsets Missouri 86-84 in NCAA tourney | publisher=The Virginian-Pilot (Associated Press) | work=HamptonRoads.com | date=March 16, 2012 | accessdate=March 16, 2012 |author=Skretta, Dave}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jens Otto Harry Jespersen''' ({{IPA-da|ʌto ˈjɛsbɐsn̩|lang}}; 16 July 1860 – 30 April 1943) was a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[linguistics|linguist]] who specialized in the grammar of the [[English language]].

==Early life==
Otto Jespersen was born in [[Randers]] in [[Jutland]]. He was inspired by the work of Danish philologist [[Rasmus Christian Rask|Rasmus Rask]] as a boy, and with the help of Rask's grammars taught himself some Icelandic, Italian, and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;http://interlanguages.net/haislund.html&lt;/ref&gt; He entered the [[University of Copenhagen]] in 1877 when he was 17, initially studying law but not forgetting his language studies. In 1881 he shifted his focus completely to languages,&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/al/research/collect/elt_archive/halloffame/jespersen/life&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1887 earned his master's degree in [[French language|French]], with English and [[Latin]] as his secondary languages. He supported himself during his studies through part-time work as a schoolteacher and as a shorthand reporter in the Danish parliament. In 1887–1888, he traveled to England, Germany and France, meeting linguists like [[Henry Sweet]] and [[Paul Passy]] and attending lectures at institutions like [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]]. Following the advice of his mentor [[Vilhelm Thomsen]], he returned to Copenhagen in August 1888 and began work on his doctoral dissertation on the English [[Grammatical case|case]] system. He successfully defended his dissertation in 1891.

==Academic life and work==
Jespersen was a professor of English at the University of Copenhagen from 1893 to 1925, and served as Rector of the university in 1920–21. His early work focused primarily on language teaching reform and on phonetics, but he is best known for his later work on syntax and on language development.

He advanced the theories of ''Rank'' and ''[[Nexus grammar|Nexus]]'' in Danish in two papers: ''Sprogets logik'' (1913) and ''De to hovedarter af grammatiske forbindelser'' (1921). Jespersen in this theory of ranks removes the parts of speech from the syntax, and differentiates between  primaries, secondaries, and tertiaries; e.g. in "''well honed phrase''," "phrase" is a primary, this being defined by a secondary, "honed", which again is defined by a tertiary "well". The term ''Nexus'' is applied to sentences, structures similar to sentences and sentences in formation, in which two concepts are expressed in one unit; e.g., ''it rained, he ran indoors''. This term is qualified by a further concept called a ''junction'' which represents one idea, expressed by means of two or more elements, whereas a nexus combines two ideas.  Junction and nexus proved valuable in bringing the concept of context to the forefront of the attention of the world of linguistics.

He was most widely recognized for some of his books. ''Language: Its Nature, Development and Origin'' (1922) is considered by many to be his masterpiece.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/al/research/collect/elt_archive/halloffame/jespersen/life&lt;/ref&gt; ''Modern English Grammar on Historical Principles'' (1909–1949), concentrated on morphology and syntax, and ''Growth and Structure of the English Language'' (1905) is a comprehensive view of English by someone with another native language, and still in print, over 70 years after his death and more than 100 years after publication. Late in his life he published ''Analytic Syntax'' (1937), in which he presents his views on syntactic structure using an idiosyncratic shorthand notation. In ''The Philosophy of Grammar'' (1924) he challenged the accepted views of common concepts in [[Grammar]] and proposed corrections to the basic definitions of [[grammatical case]], [[pronoun]], [[object (grammar)|object]], [[voice (grammar)|voice]] etc., and developed further his notions of ''Rank'' and ''Nexus''. In the 21st century this book is still used as one of the basic texts in modern [[Structural linguistics]]. ''Mankind, Nation and Individual: from a linguistic point of view'' (1925) is one of the pioneering works on [[Sociolinguistics]].

Jespersen visited the United States twice: he lectured at the Congress of Arts and Sciences in St. Louis in 1904, and in 1909–1910 he visited both the [[University of California]] and [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref&gt;Falk, Julia S. 1992. Otto Jespersen, Leonard Bloomfield, and American Structural Linguistics. ''Language'' 68(3):465-491.&lt;/ref&gt; While in the U.S., he took occasion to study the country's educational system. His autobiography (see below) was published in English translation as recently as 1995.

Jespersen was a proponent of [[phonosemantics|phonosemanticism]] and wrote:  “Is there really much more logic in the opposite extreme which denies any kind of [[sound symbolism]] (apart from the small class of evident echoisms and ‘[[onomatopoeia]]’) and sees in our words only a collection of accidental and irrational associations of sound and meaning? ...There is no denying that there are words which we feel instinctively to be adequate to express the ideas they stand for.”

After his retirement in 1925, Jespersen remained active in the international linguistic community. In addition to continuing to write, he convened and chaired the first International Meeting on Linguistic Research in Geneva in 1930, and acted as president of the Fourth International Congress of Linguists in Copenhagen in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Falk 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

Jespersen was an important figure in the [[Universal language|international language]] movement. He was an early supporter of the [[Esperanto]] offshoot [[Ido (language)|Ido]] and in 1927 published his own project [[Novial]]. He also worked with the [[International Auxiliary Language Association]].&lt;ref&gt;Falk, Julia S. "Words without grammar: Linguists and the international language movement in the United States, ''Language and Communication'', 15(3): pp. 241–259. Pergamon, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jespersen received honorary degrees from Columbia University in New York (1910), St. Andrews University in Scotland (1925), and the Sorbonne in Paris (1927).&lt;ref&gt;http://interlanguages.net/haislund.html&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the first six international scholars to be elected as honorary members of the [[Linguistic Society of America]].&lt;ref&gt;Falk 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are hundreds and thousands of [[Pakistan]]i students who travel abroad each year in order to attain higher education. Countries which have large Pakistani international student populations include those in [[Europe]], North America, China and Australia. Every year, nearly 10,000 foreign student visas are granted in Pakistan.&lt;ref name="spike"/&gt;

==United Kingdom==
According to various reports, there are nearly 10,000 Pakistani students studying in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pallyweb.com/talented-students-to-be-welcomed-in-uk-envoy|title=Car services in talented-students-to-be-welcomed-in-uk-envoy|first=Ivan|last=Bleart|website=pallyweb.com|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iptu.co.uk/content/pakistan_economy.asp|title=Pakistan Trade, Pakistan Industries, India Pakistan Trade Unit|first=Websynergi|last=Design|website=www.iptu.co.uk|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; All in all, between 2004 and 2008, as many as 42,000 Pakistani students were admitted into the UK.&lt;ref name="spike"&gt;[http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php/site/printable/6543/ Don’t close the door to Asian students] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203123823/http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php/site/printable/6543/ |date=2012-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an [[Oxford University Pakistan Society]] at the University of Oxford as well as Strathclyde University Pakistan Society at University of Strathclyde Glasgow.

==United States==
As of 2011, there were 5,045 Pakistani students in the [[United States]], putting Pakistan among the top 25 countries sending students to the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pdwali.wordpress.com/2010/11/20/u-s-embassy-islamabad-celebrates-international-education-week/|title=U.S. Embassy Islamabad Celebrates International Education Week|date=20 November 2010|publisher=|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The volume of Pakistani students migrating to the United States has been relatively stable over the past few years. ''[[The Express Tribune]]'' reports that the drop in the number of Pakistani students in the United States following the September 11 attacks is a myth and observes that the numbers going to the US for study have simply decreased due to an increase in more higher education institutions opening back home. According to Shazia Khan, "In the last 10 years, there has been an increase in the number of higher education institutes in Pakistan. This encourages many students to study in the country and not apply abroad".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/363168/higher-education-visa-denials-a-myth-for-drop-in-pakistani-students-in-us/|title=Higher education: Visa denials a myth for drop in Pakistani students in US   - The Express Tribune|date=12 April 2012|publisher=|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portugal==
There are many Pakistani students enrolled in different Portuguese universities. Most of the students are doing their doctoral degrees. The medium of instruction for master's degree (5 years) is Portuguese but doctoral level research is in English. Most of the students have scholarship from the Portuguese Foundation of Science and Technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fct.pt/|title=FCT - Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia|website=www.fct.pt|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the programs are specifically designed for foreign students like the programs offered by the MAP&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.map.edu.pt/|title=MAP         —         MAP|website=www.map.edu.pt|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; consortium.

==China==
[[China]] also attracts a large number of students from Pakistan, with 2006 estimates putting their number well over 1,000; in [[Xinjian]] alone, there are over 500 Pakistanis in universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.app.com.pk/en_/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=73161&amp;Itemid=2|title=Xinjiang has special place in Pak, China friendship: Ambassador Khan|publisher=|accessdate=25 November 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303210841/http://www.app.com.pk/en_/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=73161&amp;Itemid=2|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, there are over 5,000 Pakistani medical students studying in China as of September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2012%5C09%5C10%5Cstory_10-9-2012_pg7_27|title=Daily Times|website=Daily Times|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, there were 19,000 Pakistani students in China, making Pakistan the fourth largest source of international students in the country. The main disciplines of studies pursued included medicine, engineering, economics and management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1317973/|title=19,000 Pakistani students studying in Chinese universities|work=Dawn|date=3 March 2017|accessdate=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cuba==
There are some 1,000 Pakistani medical students in [[Cuba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opfblog.com/9267/the-plight-of-pakistani-medical-students-in-cuba/|title=THE PLIGHT OF PAKISTANI MEDICAL STUDENTS IN CUBA|date=17 September 2009|publisher=|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are on scholarships under a program between the Cuban government and the [[Higher Education Commission (Pakistan)|Higher Education Commission]] (HEC) of Pakistan. Presently, these students are enrolled in three leading Medical Universities of Cuba named Universidad de Ciencias Médicas Villa Clara, Universidad de Ciencias Médicas Sancti Spiritus and Universidad de Ciencias Médicas Cienfuegos.
In February 2014 the first batch of 295 students graduated from the University of Villa Clara. The ceremony was held in the presence of ambassador of Pakistan in Cuba and vice minister of Cuba for health.

== Germany ==
Nowadays Germany is also a choice of many Pakistani Students to study. The only barrier that students face is the language. Although some study programs are in English but they have to learn [[German Language]] for their daily life. There are both undergraduate and graduate programs available. But those who are undergraduate have to do one-year program [[Studienkolleg]].

==Other==
There are over 2,000 Pakistani students of medicine in the Central Asian state of [[Kyrgyzstan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlinenews.com.pk/details.php?id=159882|title=Kyrgyzstan envoy for strengthening cultural and social relations with Pak|publisher=|accessdate=25 November 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308071620/http://www.onlinenews.com.pk/details.php?id=159882|archivedate=8 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Australia]], there were 1,626 Pakistani students as of 2005;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pakistan.embassy.gov.au/islm/study.html|title=Australian High Commission in|first=corporateName= Department of Foreign Affairs and|last=Trade|website=www.pakistan.embassy.gov.au|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; this figure increased to 11,000 as of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/564867/blazing-trails-australia-and-pakistan/|title=Blazing trails: Australia and Pakistan  - The Express Tribune|date=19 June 2013|publisher=|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pakistan.embassy.gov.au/islm/PR270511Alumni.html|title=Australian High Commission in|first=corporateName= Department of Foreign Affairs and|last=Trade|website=www.pakistan.embassy.gov.au|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report in 2012 showed that Pakistan was becoming the "top growth market" for international students choosing to study in Australia, ranking 10th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/pakistan-bucks-student-trend/story-e6frgcjx-1226356707116|title=Subscribe - theaustralian|website=www.theaustralian.com.au|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are about 100 Pakistani students in the National University of Singapore in Singapore, Studying: many subjects such as: Health, Engineering, Computer Science, Law etc.

There are also significant number of Pakistani students in [[Bangladesh]], mainly studying in the fields of medicine and dentistry. As of 2012, there were 80 registered Pakistani students in several Bangladeshi medical and dental colleges, studying under the SAARC quota. Every year, the [[government of Pakistan]] sends 14 students to study medicine in Bangladesh, selected by a test of National Testing Service and approved by the [[Ministry of Education (Pakistan)|Ministry of Education]] of Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://khabarsouthasia.com/en_GB/articles/apwi/articles/features/2012/04/03/feature-02#comments | title=Bangladesh enjoys South Asian "brain gain" | agency=Khabar South Asia | accessdate=May 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poland also attracts students from Pakistan, studying mostly: Health and Medicine &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.studyfun.pl/2013/04/congo-pakistan-sweden-minhaal-from.html|title=Congo Pakistan Sweden Minhaal from Gdansk|website=blog.studyfun.pl|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22456">In [[social psychology]], '''reciprocity''' is a [[social norm]] of responding to a positive action with another positive action, rewarding kind actions. As a social construct, reciprocity means that in response to friendly actions, people are frequently much nicer and much more cooperative than predicted by the self-interest model; conversely, in response to hostile actions they are frequently much more nasty and even brutal.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.14.3.159 |last=Fehr and Gächter | title = Fairness and Retaliation: The Economics of Reciprocity | journal = Journal of Economic Perspectives }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reciprocity makes it possible to build continuing relationships and exchanges. Fukiyama &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fukuyama | first = F | date= 1996 | title = Trust: the Social Virtues and Creation of Prosperity | publisher = London: Free Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that “If the institutions of democracy and capitalism are to work properly, they must coexist within certain premodern cultural habits that ensure their proper functioning” (p.&amp;nbsp;11). He goes on to say “Law, contract, and economic rationality and prosperity…. must as well be leavened with reciprocity, moral obligation, duty toward community, and trust…. The latter are not anachronisms in a modern society but rather the sine qua non of the latter’s success” (p.&amp;nbsp;11) According to the sociologist Alvin Gouldner (1960), this norm is nearly universal, and only a few members of society—the very young, the sick, or the old—are exempt from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/878812937|title=Social psychology|last=R.|first=Smith, Eliot|others=Mackie, Diane M., Claypool, Heather M.|isbn=9781848728936|edition= Fourth|location=New York|oclc=878812937}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reciprocal actions differ from altruistic actions in that reciprocal actions only follow from others' initial actions, while altruism is the unconditional act of social gift-giving without any hope or expectation of future positive responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Is empathetic emotion a source of altruistic motivation?|last = Batson, C.

For more information on this idea, see [[altruism]] or [[altruism (ethics)]].

== History ==
Reciprocity dates as far back as the time of [[Hammurabi]] (c. 1792–1750 BC). [[Code of Hammurabi|Hammurabi's code]], a collection of 282 laws and standards, lists crimes and their various punishments as well as guidelines for citizens' conduct.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The code was formalized example that demanded the individual act in terms of the public interest. The "eye for an eye" principles in which the laws were written mirror the idea of direct reciprocity. For example, if a person caused the death of another person, the killer would be put to death:

Law #196: "If a man destroy the eye of another man, they shall destroy his eye. If one break a man's bone, they shall break his bone. If one destroy the eye of a freeman or break the bone of a freeman he shall pay one gold mina. If one destroy the eye of a man's slave or break a bone of a man's slave he shall pay one-half his price."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Code of Hammurabi: Hammurabi's Code of Laws: Paragraphs 100-199|url = http://www.sacred-texts.com/ane/ham/ham06.htm|website = www.sacred-texts.com|accessdate = 2015-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reciprocity was also a cornerstone of [[ancient Greece]]. In Homeric Greece, citizens relied on reciprocity as a form of transaction as there was no formal system of government or trade.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Greek Ideals|url = http://merkspages.com/HWCIV/Greece/idealschart.htm|website = merkspages.com|accessdate = 2015-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'', he illustrates several instances of reciprocal transactions in the form of gift giving. For example, in Book VI of the Iliad, Glaucus and Diomedes exchange armor when they discover that their grandfathers were friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Iliad. (B. Knox, Ed. R. Fagles, Trans.)|last = Homer|first = |publisher = Penguin Classics|year = 1990|isbn = |location = New York, NY|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there were times when direct reciprocity was not possible, specifically in times of great need when a citizen had nothing to give for repayment. Thus, deferred reciprocity was also prevalent in Greek culture at this time. Deferred reciprocity refers to giving a person gifts or favors with the understanding that they will repay this favor at another time when the initial giver is in great need. This form of reciprocity was used extensively by travelers, particularly in the [[Odyssey]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Odysseus often had to rely on the kindness of human strangers and other mythological creatures to secure resources along his journey.

In the classical Greek ''[[polis]]'', large-scale projects such as construction of temples, building of warships and financing of choruses were carried out as gifts to individual donors. In Rome, wealthy elite were linked with their dependents in a cycle of reciprocal gift giving.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Personal Patronage Under the Early Empire|url = https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=E7RayowC-IQC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR5&amp;dq=saller+1982&amp;ots=klhLflL-GB&amp;sig=JeaQuzS7St7yHzSWvEo2dyXbRWk#v=onepage&amp;q=saller%25201982&amp;f=false|publisher = Cambridge University Press|date = 2002-05-09|isbn = 9780521893923|first = Richard P.|last = Saller}}&lt;/ref&gt; As these examples suggest, reciprocity enjoyed a cultural prestige among ancient aristocracies for whom it was advantageous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Reciprocity|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781444338386.wbeah06274/abstract|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|date = 2013-01-01|isbn = 9781444338386|doi = 10.1002/9781444338386.wbeah06274/full|first = Neil|last = Coffee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== An adaptive mechanism ==
Richard Leakey and [[Roger Lewin]] attribute the very nature of humans to reciprocity. They claim humans survived because our ancestors learned to share goods and services "in an honored network of obligation".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = leakey and lewin 1978 - Google Scholar|url = https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=leakey+and+lewin+1978&amp;btnG=&amp;as_sdt=1%252C5&amp;as_sdtp=|website = scholar.google.com|accessdate = 2015-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the idea that humans are indebted to repay gifts and favors is a unique aspect of human culture. [[Cultural anthropology|Cultural anthropologists]] support this idea in what they call the "web of indebtedness" where reciprocity is viewed as an adaptive mechanism to enhance survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The origins of virtue|last = Ridley|first = M.|publisher = Penguin UK|year = 1997|isbn = |location = UK|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this approach, reciprocity creates an interdependent environment where labor is divided so that humans may be more efficient. For example, if one member of the group cares for the children while another member hunts for food for the group, each member has provided a service and received one in return. Each member can devote more time and attention to his or her allotted task and the whole group benefits. This meant that individuals could give away resources without actually giving them away. Through the rule of reciprocity, sophisticated systems of aid and trade were possible bringing immense benefits to the societies that utilized them.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Given the benefits of reciprocity at the societal level, it is not surprising that the norm has persisted and dictates our present cognition and behavior.

== The power of reciprocity ==
Reciprocity is not only a strong determining factor of human behavior; it is a powerful method for gaining one's compliance with a request. The rule of reciprocity has the power to trigger feelings of indebtedness even when faced with an uninvited favor&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = When an Adversary is Caught Telling the Truth: Reciprocal Cooperation Versus Self-Interest in Distributive Bargaining|url = http://psp.sagepub.com/content/26/1/79|journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|date = 2000-01-01|issn = 0146-1672|pages = 79–90|volume = 26|issue = 1|doi = 10.1177/0146167200261008|first = Paul W.|last = Paese|first2 = Debra A.|last2 = Gilin}}&lt;/ref&gt; and irrespective of liking the person who executed the favor.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In 1971, Dennis Regan tested the strength of these two aspects of reciprocity in a study where participants believed they were in an art appreciation experiment with a partner, Joe, who was really Regan's assistant. During the experiment, Joe would disappear and bring back a soft drink for the participant. After this phase of the experiment was over, Joe would ask the participant to buy raffle tickets from him. The more the participants liked Joe, the more likely they were to buy raffle tickets from him. However, when Joe had given them a soda and thus indebted them to reciprocate, it made no difference whether the participants liked Joe or not, the rule of reciprocity overpowered liking.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Effects of a favor and liking on compliance|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022103171900254|journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|date = 1971-11-01|pages = 627–639|volume = 7|issue = 6|doi = 10.1016/0022-1031(71)90025-4|first = Dennis T.|last = Regan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, individuals who we might not even like have the power to greatly increase our chances of doing them a favor simply by providing us with a small gift or favor prior to their request. Furthermore, we are obliged to receive these gifts and favors which reduces our ability to choose to whom we wish to be indebted.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1976, Phillip Kunz demonstrated the automatic nature of reciprocity in an experiment using Christmas cards. In this experiment, Kunz sent out holiday cards with pictures of his family and a brief note to a group of complete strangers. While he expected some reaction, holiday cards came pouring back to him from people who had never met nor heard of him and who expressed no desire to get to know him any better.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Season's greetings: From my status to yours|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0049089X7690003X|journal = Social Science Research|date = 1976-09-01|pages = 269–278|volume = 5|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/0049-089X(76)90003-X|first = Phillip R|last = Kunz|first2 = Michael|last2 = Woolcott}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of these individuals who responded never inquired into Kunz's identity, they were merely responding to his initial gesture with a reciprocal action.

[[Politics]] is another area where the power of reciprocity is evident. While politicians often claim autonomy from the feelings of obligation associated with gifts and favors that influence everyone else, they are also susceptible. In the 2002 election, [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] Representatives who received the most money from [[Special Interest Group|special interest groups]] were over seven times more likely to vote in favor of the group that had contributed the most money to their campaigns.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Ernst Fehr|Fehr]] and [[Simon Gächter|Gächter]] (2000) showed that, when acting within reciprocal frameworks, individuals are more likely to deviate from purely self-interested behavior than when acting in other social contexts. [[Magnanimity]] is often repaid with disproportionate amounts of [[kindness]] and [[cooperation]], and [[Betrayal|treachery]] with disproportionate amounts of [[Anti-Americanism|hostility]] and [[vengeance (concept)|vengeance]], which can significantly surpass amounts determined or predicted by conventional economic models of [[Rational egoism|rational self-interest]]. Moreover, reciprocal tendencies are frequently observed in situations wherein [[transaction cost]]s associated with specific reciprocal actions are high and present or future material rewards are not expected. Whether self-interested or reciprocal action dominates the aggregate outcome is particularly dependent on context; in [[Market (economics)|markets]] or market-like scenarios characterized by [[Competition|competitiveness]] and [[incomplete contracts]], reciprocity tends to win out over self-interest.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fehr|first=Ernst|last2=Gächter|first2=Simon|date=2000-01-01|title=Fairness and Retaliation: The Economics of Reciprocity|jstor=2646924|journal=The Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=14|issue=3|pages=159–181|doi=10.1257/jep.14.3.159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Positive and negative reciprocity ===
Positive reciprocity occurs when an action committed by one individual that has a positive effect on someone else is returned with an action that has an approximately equal positive effect.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Trade: Chapter 125-7: Positive Reciprocity|url = http://internationalecon.com/Trade/Tch125/T125-7.php|website = internationalecon.com|accessdate = 2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Caliendo 394–409"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Trust, positive reciprocity, and negative reciprocity: Do these traits impact entrepreneurial dynamics?|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167487011000158|journal = Journal of Economic Psychology|date = 2012-04-01|pages = 394–409|volume = 33|series = Personality and Entrepreneurship|issue = 2|doi = 10.1016/j.joep.2011.01.005|first = Marco|last = Caliendo|first2 = Frank|last2 = Fossen|first3 = Alexander|last3 = Kritikos}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if someone takes care of another person's dog, the person who received this favor should then return this action with another favor such as with a small gift. However, the reciprocated action should be approximately equal to the first action in terms of positive value, otherwise this can result in an uncomfortable social situation.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = To whom do positive norm and negative norm of reciprocity apply? Effects of inequitable offer, relationship, and relational-self orientation|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103108001583|journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|date = 2009-01-01|pages = 24–34|volume = 45|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/j.jesp.2008.07.024|first = Ya-Ru|last = Chen|first2 = Xiao-Ping|last2 = Chen|first3 = Rebecca|last3 = Portnoy}}&lt;/ref&gt; If someone takes care of another person's dog and that person returns the favor by buying that individual a car, the reciprocated gift is inappropriate because it does not equal the initial gesture. Individuals expect actions to be reciprocated by actions that are approximately equal in value.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

One example of positive reciprocity is that waitresses who smile broadly receive more tips than waitresses who present a minimal smile.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Monetary significance of the affiliative smile: A case for reciprocal altruism|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03336849|journal = Bulletin of the Psychonomic Society|date = 2013-11-14|issn = 0090-5054|pages = 344–346|volume = 11|issue = 6|doi = 10.3758/BF03336849|first = Kathi L.|last = Tidd|first2 = Joan S.|last2 = Lockard}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, free samples are not merely opportunities to taste a product but rather invitations to engage in the rule of reciprocity. Many people find it difficult to accept the free sample and walk away. Instead, they buy some of the product even when they did not find it that enjoyable.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Negative reciprocity occurs when an action that has a negative effect on someone is returned with an action that has an approximately equal negative effect.&lt;ref name="Caliendo 394–409"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Trade: Chapter 125-8: Negative Reciprocity|url = http://internationalecon.com/Trade/Tch125/T125-8.php|website = internationalecon.com|accessdate = 2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if an individual commits a violent act against a person, it is expected that person would return with a similar act of violence. If, however, the reaction to the initial negative action is not approximately equal in negative value, this violates the norm of reciprocity and what is prescribed as allowable.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Retaliatory aspects i.e. the aspects of trying to get back and cause harm, are known as negative reciprocity. This definition of negative reciprocity is distinct from the way negative reciprocity is defined in other domains. In cultural anthropology, negative reciprocity refers to an attempt to get something for nothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Stone Age Economics|last = Sahlins|first = Marshall|publisher = Aldine de Gruyter|year = 1972|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 195}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often referred to as "bartering" or "haggling" (see [[reciprocity (cultural anthropology)]] for more information).

== Reciprocal concessions ==
There are more subtle ways of initiating the reciprocity rule than merely doing something nice for someone so you may expect something in return. One form of this more subtle form of reciprocity is the idea of reciprocal concessions in which the requester lowers his/her initial request, making the respondent more likely to agree to a second request. Under the rule of reciprocity, we are obligated to concede to someone who has made a concession to us.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; That is, if an individual starts off by requesting something large and you refuse, you feel obligated to consent to their smaller request even though you might not be interested in either of the things they are offering. [[Robert Cialdini]] illustrates an example of this phenomenon by telling a story of a boy who asks him to buy five-dollar circus tickets and, when Cialdini refuses, asks him to buy some one dollar chocolate bars. Cialdini feels obligated to return the favor and consents to buying some of the chocolate bars.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The rule of reciprocity operates in reciprocal concessions in two ways. First, an individual is pressured to reciprocate one concession for another by nature of the rule itself. Second, because the individual who initially concedes can expect to have the other person concede in return, this person is free to make the concession in the first place. If there were no social pressure to return the concession, an individual runs the risk of giving up something and getting nothing in return. Mutual concession is a procedure that can promote compromise in a group so that individuals can refocus their efforts toward achieving a common goal. Reciprocal concessions promote compromise in a group so that the initial and incompatible desires of individuals can be set aside for the benefit of social cooperation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== The door in the face technique ===
The [[Door-in-the-face technique|door in the face technique]], otherwise known as the rejection-then-retreat technique, involves making an outrageous request that someone will almost certainly turn down, and then make the smaller request that was the favor of interest all along. If done skillfully, the second request is seen as a concession so compliance with the second request is obtained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Reciprocal concessions procedure for inducing compliance: The door-in-the-face technique.|url = http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/31/2/206/|website = APA PsycNET|accessdate = 2015-11-18|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Foot-in-the-door and door-in-the-face: a comparative meta-analytic study|url = http://www.amsciepub.com/doi/abs/10.2466/pr0.96.1.122-128|journal = Psychological Reports|date = 2005-02-01|issn = 0033-2941|pages = 122–128|volume = 96|issue = 1|doi = 10.2466/pr0.96.1.122-128|first = Alexandre|last = Pascual|first2 = Nicolas|last2 = Guéguen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Psychological Reality of the Door-in-the-Face It’s Helping, not Bargaining|url = http://jls.sagepub.com/content/19/1/5|journal = Journal of Language and Social Psychology|date = 2000-03-01|issn = 0261-927X|pages = 5–25|volume = 19|issue = 1|doi = 10.1177/0261927X00019001001|first = Kyle James|last = Tusing|first2 = James Price|last2 = Dillard}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, one must proceed with caution when using this technique. If the first request is so big that it is seen as unreasonable, the door in the face technique proves useless as the concession made after is not perceived as genuine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Applicability of the Door-in-the Face Technique when Established Behavioral Customs Exist|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1559-1816.1979.tb00817.x/abstract|journal = Journal of Applied Social Psychology|date = 1979-12-01|issn = 1559-1816|pages = 576–586|volume = 9|issue = 6|doi = 10.1111/j.1559-1816.1979.tb00817.x|first = Joseph|last = Schwarzwald|first2 = Moshe|last2 = Raz|first3 = Moshe|last3 = Zvibel}}&lt;/ref&gt; The door in the face technique is not to be confused with the [[Foot-in-the-door technique|foot in the door technique]] where individuals getting a person to agree with a large request by first getting them to agree to a moderate request.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The foot-in-the-door compliance procedure: A multiple-process analysis and review|last = Burger|first = J.M.|date = 1999|journal = Personality and Social Psychology Review, 3, 303-325|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

Tavernor was born in England and studied architecture in London (BA and Dip. Arch with Distinction, 1973–79), Rome ([[British Prix de Rome]] in Architecture at the [[British School at Rome]], 1979–80&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsr.ac.uk/awards/architecture-awards-ii/rome-prize-in-architecture-2 |title=Rome Prize in Architecture « The British School at Rome |publisher=Bsr.ac.uk |date=2011-10-26 |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and at the [[University of Cambridge]] (St John's College, 1980–83, doctorate awarded 1985), where his PhD thesis, ''Concinnitas in the Architectural Theory and Practice of Leon Battista Alberti'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dspace.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/239042 |title=Concinnitas in the architectural theory and practice of Leon Battista Alberti |publisher=Dspace.cam.ac.uk |date=1985-11-12 |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; was supervised by [[Joseph Rykwert]]. He is a registered architect and a member of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (since 1985).

He has held multiple academic posts in the UK. He was formerly Forbes Professor of Architecture at the [[University of Edinburgh]] (1992–95), Professor of Architecture and Head of the Department of Architecture and Civil Engineering at the [[University of Bath]] (1995–2005), LSE Professor of Architecture and Urban Design (2005–2011) and Director of the [[LSE Cities]] Programme (2005–08). He held various visiting academic posts internationally, including Visiting Professor at the [[University of California at Los Angeles]] (UCLA, 1998), European Union Visiting Scholar in planning and conservation at the [[University of Texas A&amp;M]] (2002); and Visiting Professor in Architecture and Urbanism at the University of São Paulo, Brazil (2004), and the University of Bath (since 2009).

He founded the Centre for Advanced Studies in Architecture (CASA) at Bath, and with [[Vaughan Hart]], established a focus on Classical and Italian Renaissance architectural treatises; between them they have translated and written about the leading classical architectural theorists – including, [[Vitruvius]], [[Leon Battista Alberti|Alberti]], [[Sebastiano Serlio|Serlio]] and [[Andrea Palladio|Palladio]]. He has been a national assessor for the Architecture and the Built Environment sub-panel of the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise (RAE2008) for the UK Higher Education Funding Council for Education (HEFCE), and a member of the Faculty of the Fine Arts of the British School at Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsr.ac.uk/about/governance |title=Governance « The British School at Rome |publisher=Bsr.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tavernor initiated (with co-authors) a series of modern translations of the principal classical architectural treatise writers – Vitruvius, Alberti and Palladio – and is the sole author of parallel monographs on these subjects published by (Yale&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://yalepress.yale.edu/YupBooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300124927 |title=Smoot's Ear - Tavernor, Robert - Yale University Press |work=Yalepress.yale.edu |date=2007-09-24 |accessdate=2013-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103083921/http://yalepress.yale.edu/YupBooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300124927 |archivedate=3 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and MIT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/authors/robert-tavernor |title=Robert Tavernor &amp;#124; The MIT Press |publisher=Mitpress.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; His book on Alberti was described as "the last and the best of the books on Alberti on this scale in the twentieth century" (Chronique).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/reviews.asp?isbn=9780300076158 |title=On Alberti and the Art of Building |work=Yalepress.yale.edu |date=1999-01-11 |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; He pioneered the use of the computer to visualise urban forms in architectural exhibitions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=1578928 |title=Cambridge Journals Online - arq: Architectural Research Quarterly - Abstract - Architectural history and computing |work=Journals.cambridge.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; co-curating with Rykwert in 1994 the international exhibition of Alberti's work at [[Palazzo Te]] in [[Mantua]] for the computer firm [[Olivetti]]. As a consultant architect and urbanist he applies his knowledge of architectural history, design and the visual representation of buildings in advising planners and architects on the form, character, scale and massing of tall buildings in the [[City of London]] and along the south bank of the [[Thames]]. His advice on several large urban masterplan projects in London (including Battersea Power Station) led to him being invited in 2007, by former Russian Senator Gordeev, to assemble and to contribute his expertise to an international masterplanning team to re-configure the city of [[Perm]] (population of 1 million) in the southern [[Urals]]. The published masterplan led by KCAP was awarded the Grand Prix at the Moscow Architecture Biennale in May 2010.

== Works ==

As an architectural historian and theorist, he is an expert in the foundations of [[Italian Renaissance architecture]] and the transmission of associated ideas and forms to England and America. He is the author of ''Palladio and Palladianism'' (1991 – subsequently translated into Italian, Chinese and Korean) and ''On Alberti and the Art of Building'' (1998). He is co-translator of two English translations of architectural treatises: Leon Battista Alberti’s 16th century ''De re aedificatoria'', as ''On the Art of Building in Ten Books'' (1988); and Andrea Palladio’s 17th century ''I quattro libri dell’architettura'', as ''The Four Books on Architecture'' (1997), and co-edited and provided the introduction to Vitruvius' ''On Architecture'' (2009).

Tavernor's translation works have become the standard texts in art historical scholarship, used by students and scholars throughout the world. His book ''Smoot’s Ear: The Measure of Humanity'' (2007 and 2008) pulls together much of his earlier writings and sets measures and measuring in a cultural context and shows how deeply they are connected to human experience and history.

He was co-editor of ''Body and Building: Essays on the changing relation of Body to Architecture'' (2002 and 2005), a collection of essays on art and architecture dedicated to Rykwert. He founded the Alberti Group with Rykwert, which led to the 1994 international exhibition on Alberti for Olivetti. [[Photogrammetry|Photogrammetric drawings]] relating to research for the exhibition can be found on the CASA website at Bath University. Tavernor was subsequently commissioned by the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] to produce computer animated urban and architectural reconstructions through CASA for exhibitions in London and internationally, for the Sir John Soane Exhibition (1999), Aztecs Exhibition (2003), and by [[Tate Britain]] for the Sir [[Stanley Spencer]] Exhibition (2001).&lt;ref name="C4WDefault-7769421"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/video/stanley-spencer-virtual-church-house |title=Stanley Spencer - Virtual Church-House |work=tate.org.uk |date=October 27, 2009 |accessdate=May 19, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140520044649/http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/video/stanley-spencer-virtual-church-house |archivedate=20 May 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute of International Education '''Scholar Rescue Fund''' ('''IIE-SRF''') provides fellowships for established scholars whose lives and work are threatened in their home countries. These fellowships permit professors, researchers and other senior academics to find temporary refuge at host universities and colleges anywhere in the world, enabling them to pursue their academic work and to continue to share their knowledge with students, colleagues, and the community at large. During the fellowship, conditions in a scholar's home country may improve, permitting safe return to help rebuild universities and societies ravaged by fear, conflict and repression. If safe return is not possible, the scholar may use the fellowship period to identify a longer-term opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scholarrescuefund.org/ Scholar Rescue Fund-International Institute of Education]&lt;/ref&gt; N.B. This is a program of the [[Institute of International Education]].

In 2007, as a response to an urgent appeal from Iraq's Ministry of Higher Education, IIE-SRF launched the [https://web.archive.org/web/20090611073239/http://scholarrescuefund.org/iraq/pages/intro.php Iraq Scholar Rescue Project]. The Project's goal is to rescue Iraq's most senior academics – in any academic discipline – by placing them at institutions of higher learning in countries within the Middle East and North Africa region.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.scholarrescuefund.org/about-us/iraq-scholar-rescue-project The Iraq Scholar Rescue Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Institute of International Education has helped rescue threatened scholars since its inception in 1919, demonstrating a commitment to protecting [[academic freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20090703114437415 University World News]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s, IIE was instrumental in founding the [[Emergency Committee in Aid of Displaced Foreign Scholars]], led by [[Edward R. Murrow]]. The program assisted scholars who were barred from teaching, persecuted and threatened with imprisonment by the Nazis. Over 300 scholars were rescued, some of whom became [[Nobel Laureates]] and many whose work and ideas helped shape the post-war world.&lt;ref name="Scholar Rescue Fund: Our History"&gt;[http://www.scholarrescuefund.org/about-us/our-history Scholar Rescue Fund: Our History]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other major activities undertaken throughout the Institute's history, before the formal establishment of IIE-SRF in 2002, include: The Russian Student Fund (1921-1949), Rescue of Scholars from Fascist Italy (1922-1924), Rescue of Scholars from the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939), Committee on Awards for Chinese Students (1942-1945), Emergency Program to Aid Hungarian University Students (in cooperation with World University Service) (1956-1958), The South African Education Program (1979-2001), Rescue of Burmese Refugees (1990-1992), Asia-Help (1998-2000), and Balkan-Help (1999-2000).

IIE-SRF was founded in 2002, when IIE's trustees committed to making scholar rescue a permanent part of its work. Dr. Henry Jarecki, Dr. [[Henry Kaufman]], Thomas Russo and [[George Soros]], founded the Scholar Rescue Fund to aid threatened scholars find safe haven and continue their academic work. Since then, IIE-SRF has provided over 1,190 awards with the collaboration of over 375 institutions from over 40 different countries.&lt;ref name="Scholar Rescue Fund: Our History"/&gt;

In 2006, when security concerns in Iraq reached unprecedented levels, the IIE Scholar Rescue Fund began receiving hundreds of requests for assistance from threatened Iraqi scholars at major higher education institutions across the country and it became clear that the scope and scale of the Iraqi crisis required special attention. With generous funding from the private and public sectors, most notably, the [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]]’s [[Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs]], the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] and the [[Richard Lounsbery Foundation]], the IIE Scholar Rescue Fund responded by launching the [http://scholarrescuefund.org/about-us/iraq-scholar-rescue-project Iraq Project]. From 2007 to 2014, the Iraq Project provided support to Iraqi university professors and scientists to resume their teaching and research in safety. The Project’s goal was to rescue more than 200 of Iraq's most senior academics – in any academic discipline – by placing them temporarily at institutions of higher learning in countries within the Middle East and North Africa region. (Some exceptions were made for university positions in other world regions.) By the Project’s completion in September 2014, over 280 Iraqi scholars had received fellowships to help them resume their teaching and research activities in safety.

The [http://scholarrescuefund.org/about-us/iraq-scholar-rescue-project Iraq Project] continues today through the [http://scholarrescuefund.org/about-us-iraq-project/iraq-project-distance-learning Iraq Distance Learning Initiative], which "[fills] curricular gaps within Iraqi university courses with lectures in subjects ranging from nanotechnology to renewable energy mitigate the potential for brain drain."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This include the Iraq Scholar Lecture Series and the IIE-SRF [https://mailchi.mp/6a2c45bf5116/iraq-joint-university-courses-0518 University Joint Courses Project].

==IIE-SRF Mission==
To rescue scholars and, by protecting their lives and work, increase their countries' and the world's level of knowledge. The IIE Scholar Rescue Fund formalizes an unwavering commitment to academic freedom that the Institute of International Education has demonstrated for over 90 years. At the heart of IIE-SRF is the idea that each scholar helped who continues his or her work in safety is a beacon of hope in our world.

==Scholars==
IIE-SRF grantees are professors, established researchers and other senior academics from any country, field or discipline. Candidates are reviewed for academic qualifications, the quality/potential of the candidate's work, and the urgency of threats faced. As stated by Scholar Rescue Fund, preference is given to scholars: &lt;blockquote&gt;

"- Who are facing immediate, severe and targeted threats to their lives and/or careers in their home country or country of residence;&lt;br /&gt;
 - With a Ph.D. or other highest degree in their field who have extensive teaching or research experience at a university, college or other institution of higher learning;&lt;br /&gt;
 - Who demonstrate superior academic accomplishment or promise;&lt;br /&gt;
 - Whose selection is likely to benefit the academic community in the home and/or host country or region."&lt;ref name="scholarrescuefund.org"&gt;[http://www.scholarrescuefund.org/scholars/eligibility-criteria Scholar Rescue Fund: Eligibility Criteria]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

IIE-SRF also states that: &lt;blockquote&gt;
"- Applications from female scholars and scholars who are members of ethnic, racial, cultural or religious minority groups, or those otherwise underrepresented in their field, are encouraged.&lt;br /&gt;
- Fellowships are approved by the IIE-SRF Selection Committee which convenes at least three (3) times per year.&lt;br /&gt;
- The final fellowship award is dependent upon the location of the host institution, the cost of living, and the value of any additional contributions from the host institution or other source.&lt;br /&gt;
- Host academic institutions agree to accept the fellowship funds and disburse the funds to the scholar. In most cases, host institutions are required to match the IIE-SRF fellowship award through partial salary/stipend support, 
   research materials, and other in-kind assistance."&lt;ref name="scholarrescuefund.org"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reports==
'''[http://www.scholarrescuefund.org/sites/default/files/pdf-articles/srf_report-scholar_rescue_in_the_modern_world.pdf Scholar Rescue in the Modern World]''' is the Scholar Rescue Fund's world report, funded by the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]], to share with a larger community the breadth and nature of the persecution of scholars around the globe. It is based on the data from the first five years of activity of the Scholar Rescue Fund (IIE-SRF), from its founding in April 2002 until May 2007.&lt;ref name="Scholar Rescue in the Modern World"&gt;[http://www.scholarrescuefund.org/sites/default/files/pdf-articles/srf_report-scholar_rescue_in_the_modern_world.pdf Scholar Rescue in the Modern World]&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, IIE-SRF received more than 1,000 inquiries from persecuted academics around the world. The report is based primarily on data collected from that time period from 847 applicants, 140 of whom were awarded grants.

According to "Scholar Rescue in the Modern World," life- and career-ending threats to scholars are widespread and egregious. Individuals in 101 countries, from a wide range of academic disciplines and fields, requested assistance; IIE-SRF provided direct support to scholars from 38 of these countries. While countries of origin spanned almost all regions of the world, seventy-five percent of IIE-SRF grantees came from two regions:  the Middle East/North Africa and [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scholarrescuefund.org/news/news/middle-east-hardest-hit-brain-drain The National: Middle East hardest hit by "brain drain"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The report also identified five factors that cause scholar oppression: Low [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP); high level of conflict; low academic population; low academic population per million of country population; and [[Failed state]] status. The report also states that governments outnumber [[non-state actors]], such as militias and rebel groups, in oppressing scholars by a factor of 3:1.
The report also recommends several new programs or activities to mitigate scholar oppression worldwide. Recommendations include: a [[United Nations]] convention against the persecution of academics; special visas to enable persecuted scholars to cross borders to safety; and an index of academic oppression that might predict violence against scholars and in particular when and where the next big academic emergency might occur, much like [[Iraq]].&lt;ref name="Scholar Rescue in the Modern World"/&gt;

==Scholars’ countries of origin==
The IIE-SRF Fellowships have no geographic limits on awards, on the disciplines, or fields supported. Fellowships may be awarded to scholars from any country and/or institutions. As of 2017, IIE-SRF has hosted more than 750 scholars from the Middle East and North Africa (70.6%), Sub-Saharan Africa (11.1%), Europe and Eurasia (9.0%), Central, East, and South Asia (7.7%), and Latin American and the Caribbean (1.3%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=By the Numbers|url=http://scholarrescuefund.org/about-us/numbers|website=Scholar Rescue Fund}}&lt;/ref&gt; Below is a list of the nations from which scholars have been granted IIE-SRF fellowships:

==Host Institutions==
The support and partnership of the international academic community is critical to the work of IIE-SRF. IIE-SRF works closely with each host partner institution to arrange a fellowship term and visiting position that works best for the scholar and the institution. As a visiting scholar, the IIE-SRF fellow might contribute to ongoing research or begin original research; complete pending publications; teach or co-teach; guest lecture in one or across departments; and/or serve as an on-campus resource to both students and faculty within any range of fields or subject matters. Beyond their academic fields, fellows may also be interested to share their personal experiences and knowledge related to their home countries and regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=For Hosts|url=http://scholarrescuefund.org/hosts|website=Scholar Rescue Fund}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
IIE-SRF collaborates with the host partner institution to arrange fellowship appointments, typically for one year. Fellows are eligible to apply for a renewal award. If conditions in their home countries improve, fellows may return after their fellowships to make meaningful contributions to their national academies and civil society. If safe return is not possible, they may use the fellowship period to identify longer-term opportunities.
Below is a list of some of the nations that have participated as host institutions and have provided scholars a safe environment to continue their academic work: &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=For Hosts|url=http://scholarrescuefund.org/hosts|website=Scholar Rescue Fund}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Engeström maintained that "Social network theory fails to recognise such real-world dynamics because its notion of sociality is limited to just people." Instead, he proposed what he called "object centered sociality," citing the work of the sociologist [[Karin Knorr-Cetina]]. For example, Engeström maintained that much of the success of the popular photo-sharing site [[Flickr]] was because photographs serve as social objects around which conversations of social networks form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Engeström|first=Jyri|title=Why some social network services work and others don’t — Or: the case for object-centered sociality|url=http://www.zengestrom.com/blog/2005/04/why-some-social-network-services-work-and-others-dont-or-the-case-for-object-centered-sociality.html|accessdate=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sonia Machanick''' (15 June 1925 – 12 November 1977) was a South African medical doctor, author and educational psychologist who pioneered new methods of teaching children with dyslexia and other learning difficulties. She founded Japari School,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://rosebankkillarneygazette.co.za/139819/japari-celebrates-48-years/|title=Japari celebrates 48 years {{!}} Rosebank Killarney Gazette|date=2014-07-02|work=Rosebank Killarney Gazette|access-date=2018-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; a special school in Johannesburg that provides education for children who struggle to thrive in the mainstream education system. She wrote a series of four graded reading books (''Sounds Travel Too)''  and other reading tutors in English and Afrikaans (Tom Kan Lees)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/tom-lees-boek-1/oclc/814147342&amp;referer=brief_results|title=Tom lees.

== Early life and education ==
Machanick was the second of three children born in Cape Town to immigrant parents; her mother from the United Kingdom and her father from Lithuania. Her mother, Edna Annie Love Courtnall, was one of the first female LLB graduates (1922)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.senatehouselibrary.ac.uk|title=University of London Students 1836-1938|last=London University|first=|date=1836|website=Senate House Library|archive-url=http://archives.ulrls.lon.ac.uk/resources/graduates2.pdf|archive-date=1922|dead-url=|access-date=September 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the University of London,  and she later set up a National Fellowship Award through the South African Association of Women graduates. Awards every year are made to two South African women who are studying for a Dipoma or Degree in any dicipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.saawg.org/Bursaries.html|title=National Fellowship Awards|last=Machanick|first=Edna|date=|website=South African Association of Women Graduates|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After completing school, Sonia Machanick enrolled on the medical course at Cape Town University. While a student, she initiated a vacation scheme for medical students to provide medical support at a mission hospital in the Transkei and she was a member of the team that inaugurated [[SHAWCO]], a student-run NGO based at the [[University of Cape Town]], that seeks to improve the quality of life for individuals in developing communities within the Cape Metropolitan area.

After graduating in 1947, she returned to the main university campus to study psychology and she worked at the University Child Guidance Clinic. 

She married [[Hillel Abbe Shapiro]] who was a lecturer at the university medical school.

== Career ==
Soon after, they relocated to Johannesburg where she was initially employed at the Alexandra Township TB clinic and then as a registrar at Tara Hospital. 

These experiences informed her decision to forge a career in the area of remedial education, with the specific aim of developing facilities for the diagnosis and treatment of children whose emotional and educational needs were not catered for in the mainstream educational system and she started working with children who struggled with a range of learning problems, including emotional behavioural issues, dyslexia and dyspraxia. 

Together with her husband and a group of other parents, Sonia Machanick was instrumental in founding South Africa's first mainstream multi-racial high school, Woodmead School&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/194949.stm|title=BBC News {{!}} Education {{!}} The new struggle|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2018-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== JAPARI School ==
As her practice grew, the need for larger premises led to her setting up [[Japari School|Japari School in Johannesburg]] in 1966.

The school expanded further with new buildings and was able to take larger numbers of children as well as hosting conferences and work placements for special needs teachers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although this was during the Apartheid era, Japari operated from the start on a non-racial basis, and also supported black pupils with scholarships to mainstream schools.

After her early death aged 52 in 1977, there was a period of uncertainty, after which the school re-established itself on a new site. Dr Machanick's work in the field of educational research was recognised by the College of Medicine of South Africa, and the College established the Sonia Machanick Travelling Fellowship.[[Japari School#cite%20note-2|&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] The Sonia Machanick Memorial Lecture was set up after her death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Z7nkrSulZigC&amp;pg=PA116&amp;lpg=PA116&amp;dq=sonia+machanick+memorial+lecture#v=onepage&amp;q=sonia%20machanick%20memorial%20lecture&amp;f=false|title=Advances in Research &amp; Services for Children with Special Needs|last=Schwartz|first=Geraldine J.|date=1983|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=9780774801645}}&lt;/ref&gt; From January 2002 the headteacher has been Steve Rees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://japari.co.za/about/history/|title=History – Japari School|work=Japari School|access-date=2018-09-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21648">The '''TestDaF,''' formally '''Test Deutsch als Fremdsprache''' ("Test of German as a foreign language"), is a [[standardised examination|standardised]]  [[language test]] of [[German language|German]] proficiency for non-native German speakers. It aims at people who would like to study at, or academics and scientists who want to work in, German universities. The test is run by the [[TestDaF-Institut]].&lt;ref name="Goethe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goethe.de/lrn/prj/pba/bes/tdf/enindex.htm|title=German examinations - Our examinations  - TestDaF - Goethe-Institut |publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The test can be taken in 95 different countries around the world. The test covers listening comprehension, reading comprehension, writing and speaking, and is recognised by [[List of universities in Germany|German universities]] as proof of prospective students' ability.

The grades of candidates are marked in terms of three levels, TDN 3 — 5, which correspond to the [[Common European Framework of Reference for Languages]] levels B2–C1.&lt;ref name="grading"&gt;{{cite web|title=Grades and Performance Description|url=http://www.testdaf.de/teilnehmer/tn-info_nivea.php|language=German|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202101953/http://www.testdaf.de/teilnehmer/tn-info_nivea.php|archivedate=2013-02-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The certificate is valid for an unlimited period of time.&lt;ref name="testdaf info"&gt;[http://www.testdaf.de/teilnehmer/pdf/informationen_en.pdf TestDaF Info] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902202500/http://www.testdaf.de/teilnehmer/pdf/informationen_en.pdf |date=2013-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
A standardised language examination for foreign students enrolling in German universities was first proposed in 1996 during the Conference of the Cultural Minister (''Kultusministerkonferenz'').

In early 1998, the financial support from Foreign Office (Auswärtigen Amt) and the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung) became available and [[German Academic Exchange Service]] (DAAD) was commissioned to hold a bidding for the project to develop a central language examination. In the same year, the contract was awarded to a consortium composed of the [[University of Hagen]], the Department of Linguistic Research of [[Ruhr-University Bochum]], [[Goethe-Institut]] and the Carl Duisberg Centre in [[Cologne]].

The project began on 1 August 1998. Before 31 July 2000 three modal tests had been drafted and were tested worldwide. The performance description, marking criteria and evaluation procedures were worked out and an [[item bank]] for [[prototype]], a [[database]] of participants and a test database were all set up.

On 26 April 2001, the TestDaF was taken for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;TestDaF – Test Deutsch als Fremdsprache. Sprachprüfung für ausländische Studienbewerber. In: Schreiber, R. (Hg.), Deutsch als Fremdsprache am Studienkolleg – Unterrichtspraxis, Tests, Evaluation. Regensburg, pp.1-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supporting organisations==
The tasks of the TestDaF have been developed by the [[TestDaF-Institut]], which is an institution run by the Society for Academic Study Preparation and Test Development (''Gesellschaft für Akademische Studienvorbereitung und Testentwicklung e.V.'').&lt;ref name="Goethe" /&gt; It is also supported by, among others, the German Rectors’ Conference (''Hochschulrektorenkonferenz''), [[German Academic Exchange Service]] and the [[Goethe-Institut]].&lt;ref name="Goethe" /&gt;

==Target group==
The primary target group of the TestDaf examination is the student applicants who have obtained their qualification in foreign countries but want to continue their study in Germany.&lt;ref name="Information"&gt;[http://www.testdaf.de/teilnehmer/tn-info_ueberblick.php Information of TestDaF] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014072418/http://www.testdaf.de/teilnehmer/tn-info_ueberblick.php |date=2013-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance to the Law of Higher Education (''Landeshochschulgesetz''), they need a proof of their proficiency in German in order to fulfil the language requirement, and thus TestDaF would be a useful.

There are also other target groups who would be interested to take the exam:&lt;ref name="Information" /&gt;

* Students who need to prove their German proficiency in their home countries.
* Students who have studied in Germany as an exchange student, and subsequently want to have their German proficiency certified.
* Scholars who have an academic visit to a German university and would like to examine his competence in German.
* Persons who need to prove their competence in German for academic works.

As TestDaf does not offer examinations in different levels, the question paper for all candidates are the same. Therefore, TestDaF is only suitable for advanced learners but not beginners.&lt;ref name="testdaf info" /&gt;

==Examination==
All the topics and tasks in the test are set within the general context of higher education.&lt;ref name="testdaf info" /&gt; They are intended for candidates of all disciplines and academic backgrounds.&lt;ref name="testdaf info" /&gt;

The examination consists of 4 parts:&lt;ref name="testdaf info" /&gt;

{| class="wikitable" width="70%"
|-
! scope="col" | Sub-test
! scope="col" | Tasks 
! scope="col" | Description
! scope="col" | Duration
|-
! scope="row" | Reading Comprehension 
| align="center" | Reading 3 texts and answering 30 questions
| Candidates need to demonstrate their ability to understand written texts related to higher education. They have to answer a set of questions which require comprehension of context and detail as well as implicit information. There are three texts at different levels of difficulty. The types of text and task also vary. For example, there could be short texts on everyday life at university, newspaper, magazine articles and articles from academic journals.&lt;ref name="testdaf info" /&gt;
| align="center" | 60 minutes
|-
! scope="row" | Listening Comprehension
| align="center" | Listening to 3 audio-texts and answering 25 questions
| Candidates need to illustrate their ability of listening comprehension by understanding spoken texts related to higher education. There are three listening texts at different levels of difficulty: a dialogue typical of everyday life at university, a radio interview with three or four speakers, and a short lecture or an interview with an expert. The types of text and tasks also vary. Understanding of context and detail as well as implicit information are required.&lt;ref name="testdaf info" /&gt;
| align="center" | Approximately 40 minutes
|-
! scope="row" | Written Production 
| align="center" | Completing 1 writing task
| Candidates' writing ability is tested by writing a well-structured text about a specific topic. They need to describe statistical data, which is presented in a graph or a table, in the first part of his text, and then state their opinion on a specific question for discussion related to the above-described data.&lt;ref name="testdaf info" /&gt;
| align="center" | 60 minutes
|-
! scope="row" | Oral Production 
| align="center" | Completing 7 speaking tasks 
| Candidates need to prove their ability to speak German in different situations related to the field of higher education. This part comprises seven tasks at variable levels of difficulty and the candidates are asked to respond in various situations in university, like discussing with fellow students, describing a diagram during a discussion section, stating your opinion on a particular topic, or forming hypotheses.&lt;ref name="testdaf info" /&gt;
| align="center" | Approximately 30 minutes
|-
|}

The examination as a whole lasts for 3 hours 10 minutes, not including the breaks.&lt;ref name="testdaf info" /&gt; The first three parts of the exam are tested in a classroom context, while the oral examination is done by speaking to a computer.

==Grading==
The result of TestDaf is not marked as simply "pass" or "fail". Since the question papers are the same for candidates, and the test needs to separate the examinees into different levels, the results of the examinees are given in three different levels:&lt;ref name="grading" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Information" /&gt;

* TestDaF-Niveaustufe 3 (TDN 3)
* TestDaF-Niveaustufe 4 (TDN 4)
* TestDaF-Niveaustufe 5 (TDN 5)

If the candidate does not reach the lowest level, "unter TDN 3" (lower than TDN 3) is printed on the certificate.

The test consists of four parts. Each part is separately graded and the sub-grades are also shown on the certificate. Some universities demand their applicants to get a certain grade in all parts of the exam (the grade is depended on the applied programme and subject), but some count the marks just in total. When a candidate fails to reach the required grade, he can re-take the exam.

The exam is marked centrally by well-trained markers.

The three TestDaF levels are designed in accordance with the [[Common European Framework of Reference for Languages]] (CEFR) as well as the performance descriptions set by the [[Association of Language Testers in Europe]] (ALTE).&lt;ref name="grading" /&gt; TDN 3 and the lower half of TDN 4 correspond to the B2 level in CEFR, and the upper half of TDN 4 and TDN 5 correspond to the C1 level.&lt;ref name="grading" /&gt;

==Certificate==
Within six weeks the candidates receive a certificate issued by the Test Centre.&lt;ref name="Information" /&gt; The certificate shows the grades of all parts of the examination and the detailed description of the reached level can be read at the back side of the certificate.&lt;ref name="Information" /&gt; If the candidate has not reached the lowest level, i.e. TDN 3, then "unter TDN 3" (lower than TDN 3) would be shown on the certificate. The certificate is valid for an unlimited period of time.&lt;ref name="testdaf info" /&gt;

==University enrollment==
In general students must get TDN 4 in all parts of the examinations in order to be admitted into universities in Germany.&lt;ref name="Goethe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Information" /&gt; But since every university in Germany has its own admissions policy, it is at the discretion of individual universities to admit applicants whose scores are below TDN 4 to their courses of study, depending on factors such as the course subject, type of degree awarded and course duration.&lt;ref name="testdaf info" /&gt;

If the candidate gets a score of TDN 5, it shows that they have a very good knowledge of German, above that required at the beginning of their studies.&lt;ref name="testdaf info" /&gt;

==Test centres==
There are approximately 450 test centres in 95 countries worldwide, offering the TestDaf exams six times a year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.testdaf.de/teilnehmer/tn-pruefung_testzentren.php Test Centres] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014044438/http://www.testdaf.de/teilnehmer/tn-pruefung_testzentren.php |date=2013-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DAAD"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.daad.de/deutschland/nach-deutschland/voraussetzungen/en/6221-german-language/|title=German language|author=DAAD - Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the officially approved test centres, which are managed by [[TestDaF-Institut]], are usually located at German and foreign universities and other higher education institutes, DAAD editorial offices,&lt;ref name="Goethe" /&gt; [[Goethe-Institut]],&lt;ref name="Goethe" /&gt; as well as the [[Adult high school]]s (''Volkshochschule'') and language schools in Germany. The test centres are responsible for:

* Advice and registration for the interested people,

==Preparation for TestDaF==
There are lots of preparation courses for TestDaF in Germany as well as foreign countries.&lt;ref name="DAAD" /&gt; These courses are offered by official test centres as well as other language schools.&lt;ref name="DAAD" /&gt; Relevant information can be obtained at the official website of TestDaf.&lt;ref name="DAAD" /&gt;

At the website of TestDaF, tips for the examination are available and sample papers can also be downloaded.&lt;ref name="DAAD" /&gt;&lt;ref name="preparation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.testdaf.de/teilnehmer/tn-vorbereitung.php|title=TestDaF-Institut|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.testdaf.de/teilnehmer/tn-vorbereitung_tipp.php Tips and Sample Tests] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212123026/http://www.testdaf.de/teilnehmer/tn-vorbereitung_tipp.php |date=2013-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, new tests of TestDaF need to be tested, and if possible, there are chances that one can register to do the new test under test in order to be familiar with the test format.&lt;ref name="preparation" /&gt;

Before registering for the exam, it is also possible to do a placement test at the website of TestDaF, so as to check the level of one's language and decide if it is suitable to register for the examination at that time.&lt;ref name="DAAD" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.testdaf.de/teilnehmer/tn-vorbereitung_test.php?id=1|title=TestDaF-Lückentest|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The TestDaF-Institut, however, does not release the test to the public, making it very hard to study alone, and most of the time, acquire a preparation course which could get expensive, considering the already high price of the test.

==Advantages and disadvantages of TestDaF==
TestDaF-Institut claims that there are many advantages for the candidate to decide to sit for the TestDaF:&lt;ref name="testdaf info" /&gt;

* All German universities recognise the TestDaF certificate.
* The TestDaF assesses the language skills necessary for study in Germany. The content and tasks of TestDaF are all academic, scientific and study-relevant topics.
* The four language skills are separately assessed and the certificate shows the results of all the sub-tests, giving the candidate an idea of his strengths and weaknesses in each area.
* The TestDaF can be taken in the home country of a candidate and the certificate is sent directly to him/her. This saves a trip to Germany and enables the candidate to collect all the required documents for the university application before travelling to Germany.
* The candidates can concentrate on specific preparation by working on model tests and samples tests provided by TestDaF-Institut at its website. And the sub-tests are guaranteed to be of same level of difficulty, regardless of the time and place of taking the exam.
* There is a worldwide network of licensed test centres where further information and advice are available. Informations could also be obtained from DAAD lecturers, Goethe Institutes, language centres and university departments of German studies or German embassies and consulates in the candidates' home country.
* The TestDaF certificate is valid for an unlimited period of time.
* The examination could be re-taken as often as one wishes, when the candidate is not satisfied with his results.

However, there is also disadvantage of taking the TestDaF, especially when compared with the [[Deutsche Sprachprüfung für den Hochschulzugang]] (DSH), where one could also fulfil the language requirement for entering German universities by getting a pass.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dkfa.de/sites/default/files/1112_TestDaF_DSH_Gegenueberstellung.pdf 1112_TestDaF DSH Gegenueberstellung]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linguistik-online.de/22_05/schleif.html|title=TestDaF oder ZOP? Welche Prüfung sagt mehr über die Studierfähigkeit aus?|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160211052112/http://www.linguistik-online.de/22_05/schleif.html|archive-date=2016-02-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deutschlernen-blog.de/blog/2001/02/28/was-ist-der-unterschied-zwischen-dsh-und-testdaf/|title=Was ist der Unterschied zwischen DSH und TestDaF?|work=Deutsch lernen und studieren in Deutschland|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The result could only be known in approximately six weeks, when compared to a much shorter time of DSH.
* The candidates need to pass all parts of the exam in order to fulfil the language requirement. But one can fulfil the requirement in DSH when his overall grade gets a pass.
* There is no specific grammar test, which is very common in a DSH exam.
* The price for TestDaF is usually higher than DSH.
* The TestDaF oral exam is done via a computer, and for some of the candidates it is strange and may affect their performance.

==Examination fee==
The fee of the examination varies according to the level of development of the country.&lt;ref name="Information" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DAAD" /&gt;

==Statistics==
The number of TestDaF candidates has increased from 7,498 candidates in 2003 took to 24,261 in 2012.  In 2003 there were only 211 test centres but this number had increased to 440 by 2012.

Students can study a wide variety of courses at Bachelor, Master and Doctoral levels full-time and part-time. The University has twelve faculties and forty-five departments,.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ui.ac.ir/ShowPage.aspx?page_=form&amp;order=show&amp;lang=1&amp;sub=0&amp;PageId=1329&amp;PageIDF=0&amp;tempname=isfahanuni]&lt;/ref&gt; University of Isfahan includes more than five hundred full-time academic members.

University of Isfahan has several research centers.

== History ==
Built it 1946, University of Isfahan has been one of the major universities in the fields of sciences, humanities, and engineering. The decision to establish the university was an idea developed by a number of doctors at Amin Hospital in 1939. Eventually, the board of directors of the hospital approved a plan to establish Isfahan Higher Medical Institute in 1946. In September of the same year, an ad signed by lecturer Dr. Jelveh, then caretaker of Isfahan Province Health and Medical Treatment Department, was published in local newspapers calling on prospective students to enroll in the new institute. The first classes were held at Sadi High School (now Soureh Institute). Many more students enrolled in subsequent years; therefore, the institute had to find a larger campus to accommodate the growing number of new students. On October 29, 1950, the first series of classes were held at the University of Isfahan. Other colleges such as the Medical University, the newly established College of Medicine and Literature College on Shahzadeh Ebrahim street also joined the University of Isfahan and were relocated in the main campus in subsequent years. The university  later offered programs in human sciences, engineering and medical sciences. Related programs of medical sciences were then separated from the University of Isfahan and became an independent university in 1985, named [[medical university of Isfahan]].
