      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5238">'''Acanthochronology''' is the [[interdisciplinary]] study of [[cactus]] [[Thorns, spines, and prickles|spines]] or ''[[Euphorbia]]'' [[Thorns, spines, and prickles|thorns]] grown in time ordered sequence (i.e. in series). Physical, morphological or chemical characteristics and information about the relative order or absolute age of the spines or thorns is used to study past climate or plant physiology.
[[File:Time ordered spines.jpg|thumb|left|Spines grown in series on a ~1m tall [[saguaro]] cactus in Tucson, Arizona. The numbers written on the cactus in black ink denote the order that the spines grew - youngest towards the apex, oldest towards the base.]]

For example, columnar cactus spines grow from the apex of the plant. After several weeks the spines stop growing and have been moved to the side of the stem. The old spines remain in place for decades as new spines are created at the continually growing apex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/aob/mcl133 |title=Structure-Function Relationships in Highly Modified Shoots of Cactaceae |journal=Annals of Botany |volume=98 |issue=5 |pages=901–926 |year=2006 |last1=Mauseth |first1=J. D |pmc=2803597 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The result is that along each external "rib" of the cactus is a series of spines arranged in the order they grew in – the oldest spines are at the bottom and the youngest spines are at the top. These spines can be dated using bomb-spike&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Radiocarbon bomb spike.svg]]{{self-published inline|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carbon-14]] and isotopes of carbon ([[Carbon-13]]) and oxygen ([[Oxygen-18]]) may be used to infer past climate&lt;ref name="English et al 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00442-007-0832-x |title=Past climate changes and ecophysiological responses recorded in the isotope ratios of saguaro cactus spines |journal=Oecologia |volume=154 |issue=2 |pages=247–258 |year=2007 |last1=English |first1=Nathan B |last2=Dettman |first2=David L |last3=Sandquist |first3=Darren R |last4=Williams |first4=David G }}&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g. precipitation or temperature), plant stem growth&lt;ref name="Delgado-Fernández et al 2016"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/RDC.2016.25 |title=On the Age and Growth Rate of Giant Cacti: Radiocarbon Dating of the Spines of Cardon (Pachycereus Pringlei) |journal=Radiocarbon |volume=58 |issue=3 |pages=479–490 |year=2016 |last1=Delgado-Fernández |first1=Mariana |last2=Garcillán |first2=Pedro P |last3=Ezcurra |first3=Exequiel }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[plant physiology]] (e.g. photosynthetic processes). Alternatively, the width of small transverse bands&lt;ref name="English et al 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1029/2009JG001008 |title=Daily to decadal patterns of precipitation, humidity, and photosynthetic physiology recorded in the spines of the columnar cactus,Carnegiea gigantea |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Biogeosciences |volume=115 |pages=n/a |year=2010 |last1=English |first1=Nathan B |last2=Dettman |first2=David L |last3=Sandquist |first3=Darren R |last4=Williams |first4=David G }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the spine may be used to infer daily information about cloud cover or plant productivity, although this remains to be tested. It has also been shown that regular waxy banding on the sides of a Costa Rican cactus ([[Lemaireocereus aragonii]]) indicate annual growth and can be used as temporal chronometers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2388815 |jstor=2388815 |title=Annual Waxy Bands on a Costa Rican Cactus |journal=Biotropica |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=229 |year=1994 |last1=Buskirk |first1=Ruth E |last2=Otis |first2=Gard W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This sub-discipline of [[paleoclimatology]] and [[ecophysiology]] is relatively new. Acanthochronology is closely related to [[dendrochronology]], [[dendroclimatology]] and [[isotope geochemistry]] and borrows many of the methods and techniques from these sub-disciplines of the [[Earth Sciences]]. It also draws heavily from the field of [[ecophysiology]], a branch of [[Biology]], to ascribe spine or thorn characteristics to particular environmental or physiological variables.{{fact|date=August 2018}}

The first peer-reviewed article&lt;ref name="English et al 2007"/&gt; to present and explain an isotope spine series was from a [[saguaro]] cactus in [[Tucson, Arizona]]. This and other work&lt;ref name="English et al 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Delgado-Fernández et al 2016"/&gt; shows that [[radiocarbon]] and [[isotope]] time-series derived from spines can be used for demographic or palaeoclimate studies.

[[File:Antonio de Morga efigie.jpg|thumb|right|Don Antonio de Morga Sánchez Garay.]]
'''Antonio de Morga Sánchez Garay''' (1559 – July 21, 1636) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] lawyer and a high-ranking colonial official for 43 years, in the [[Philippines]] (1594 to 1604), [[New Spain]] and [[Peru]], where he was president of the Audiencia for 20 years.

He was also a historian. After being reassigned to Mexico, he published the book ''[[Sucesos de las islas Filipinas]]'' in 1609, considered one of the most important works on the early history of the Spanish colonization of the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas | first = Antonio | last = de MORGA | authorlink = Antonio de Morga | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7001 | others = Annotated and reprinted by Dr José Rizal in Paris, 1890; another annotated edition by [[Wenceslao Retana|Wenceslao E RETANA]] in Madrid, 1910; first English translation by Sir Henry Edward John Stanley of Alderley published by [[Hakluyt Society]] of London, 1868; also reproduced in Blair &amp; Robertson as vols XV and XVI | publisher = en casa de Gerónymo Balli : por Cornelio Adriano Cesar | location = Mexico City | oclc = 645286630 | isbn = 978-0521010351 | origyear = 1609 | year = 1890 | language = Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Deputy Governor in the Philippines, he restored the ''audencia.'' He took over the function of judge or ''oidor''. He also took command of Spanish ships in a 1600 naval battle against Dutch corsairs, but suffered defeat and barely survived.

His history was first published in English in 1868; numerous editions have been published in English, including a 1907 edition that is online at the [[Gutenberg Project]][http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext04/8phip10.txt]. It has also been reprinted in Spanish and other languages.

==Education and service in the Philippines==
Antonio de Morga Sánchez Garay was born in [[Seville]].  He graduated from the [[University of Salamanca]] in 1574 and in 1578 received a doctorate in canon law. He taught briefly in [[Osuna]], and then returned to Salamanca to study civil law. In 1580 he joined the government service as a lawyer. Among other positions in Spain, he held that of auditor general of the galleys. In 1582 he was serving as mayor of [[Baracaldo]] in Vizcaya when he first married, to Juana de Briviesca de Munotones.&lt;ref name="cummins"/&gt;

In August 1593 he was notified that he had been selected as Lieutenant to the Governor-General of the Philippines, starting what would become 43 years of colonial service. He traveled accompanied by his family, 14 servants, three black slaves and his collection of books.&lt;ref name="cummins"/&gt; Following the route of that time, he sailed from [[Cadiz]] in February 1594, arriving in [[Mexico]] in May. During the following period of preparation for the Pacific voyage, he heard two important cases, and supervised the supplying of the two ships to be used. He also recruited 200 soldiers for the garrison in [[Manila]]. They departed [[Acapulco]] on March 22, 1595, reaching Manila on June 11, 1595. He had the second-most powerful position in the colony.&lt;ref name="cummins"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/27651727?seq=2 Journal of Southeast Asian History,'' Vol. 10, No. 3, December 1968, accessed 6 October 2014 {{subscription required|via JSTOR}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

He first served under Governor-General [[Luis Pérez Dasmariñas]], who was interim after his father's death. [[Francisco Tello de Guzmán]] soon succeeded him, and Morga reported to him during most of his time in the colony. In his account of the colonial Philippines published in 1609, Morga noted the miserable condition suffered by  many of the Spanish/Mexican soldiers, who were young, ill-paid and suffered in that unfamiliar environment. Few wanted to settle in Manila, and higher-level government officials also sought to leave the colony in a few years. His first two reports to the Crown covered a wide variety of topics, mentioning [[Japan]], [[Mindanao]], and [[China]], in addition to civil, military and ecclesiastical activities within the colony.&lt;ref name="cummins"/&gt;

He issued regulations for administrative reform, known as the ''Ordenzas.'' Among his reforms was to restore the ''audencia.'' In 1598 he resigned as lieutenant governor to assume the office of ''[[Oidor#Spanish America and the Philippines|oidor]]'', or judge, in the newly re-established [[Audiencia Real#Audiencias in the Indies|Audiencia]] of Manila. The position required his removal from much public life.

[[File:Court Ladies of the Former Shu by Tang Yin.jpg|thumb|right|''Court Ladies of Former Shu'', by [[Tang Yin]] (1470&amp;ndash;1523); late [[Ming dynasty]] silk cloths like the ones worn by ladies in this painting were imported in bulk to the Spanish territories through Manila, mentioned by de Morga.]]
During this period, Morga encouraged the growth in trade between Spain and China, known as the galleon trade. Chinese ships came to Manila to trade. From there, the Spanish sent galleons to Acapulco, where goods were shipped to Mexico City and then to [[Veracruz]], for transportation to Spain. They were paid for with Spanish/Mexican silver, which became a currency in China.&lt;ref name="cummins"/&gt;

While stationed in Manila, Morga noted many of the wares imported from the [[Ming dynasty]] of [[China]]. He mentioned [[porcelain]] only once, although at this time it was becoming one of the greatest export items, along with [[silk]], to Europe from China.&lt;ref name="brook 206"&gt;Brook, 206.&lt;/ref&gt; From his observation of textiles in the Manila inventory, the Spanish were buying:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
...raw [[silk]] in bundles...fine untwisted silk, white and of all colors...quantities of [[velvet]]s, some plain and some embroidered in all sorts of figures, colors, and fashions, with body of gold and embroidered with gold; woven stuff and [[brocade]]s, of gold and silver upon silk of various colors and patterns...damasks, satins, taffetas...&lt;ref name="brook 205"&gt;Brook, 205.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other goods that de Morga mentioned as being exported in the galleon trade were:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
...[[musk]], [[Benzoin resin|benzoin]] and [[ivory]]; many bed ornaments, hangings, coverlets and tapestries of embroidered velvet...tablecloths, cushions, and carpets; horse-trappings of the same stuffs, and embroidered with glass beads and seed-pearls; also [[pearl]]s and [[ruby|rubies]], [[sapphire]]s and crystals; metal basins, copper kettles and other copper and cast-iron pots. . .wheat flour, preserves made of [[Orange (fruit)|orange]], [[peach]], pair, [[nutmeg]] and [[ginger]], and other fruits of China; salt pork and other salt meats; live fowl of good breed and many fine [[capon]]s...[[chestnut]]s, [[walnut]]s...little boxes and writing cases; beds, tables, chairs, and gilded benches, painted in many figures and patterns. They bring domestic buffaloes; geese that resemble swans; horses, some mules and asses; even caged birds, some of which talk, while others sing, and they make them play innumerable tricks...pepper and other spices.&lt;ref name="brook 205 206"&gt;Brook, 205&amp;ndash;206.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

De Morga closed his inventory list by stating that there were "rarities which, did I refer to them all, I would never finish, nor have sufficient paper for it."&lt;ref name="brook 206"/&gt;

==Combat with Dutch corsairs==
In 1600 Dutch corsairs under [[Olivier van Noort]] were preying on shipping entering Manila harbor. According to Morga's account, Governor [[Francisco de Tello de Guzmán]] and the Audiencia appointed Morga to go to [[Cavite]] and assemble, equip and supply a fleet to attack the Dutch (October 31, 1600). The ships available were the ''San Diego'', the ''San Bartolomé'' and some smaller vessels. Some refitting was necessary, since both the ''San Diego'' and the ''San Bartolomé'' were cargo ships. According to Morga, this was done without drawing on the colonial treasury (i.e., at his own expense, perhaps with other private contributions).

Morga had had some military experience, having been general of a Spanish fleet some time previously and lieutenant of the captain general of the Philippines for some years, but he had never seen combat.
[[File:Sea Battle San Diego Eendracht 1600.jpg|thumb|250px|Illustration of 1603 representing the combat of the ''San Diego'' of Morga against the ''Mauritius'' of Van Noort]]
On December 1, 1600, Governor Tello appointed Morga captain general of the fleet, with orders to attack the two Dutch ships. The two forces met on December 14, 1600. The Spanish also had two ships, and one sailed off in pursuit of one of the Dutch ships. Unable to fire – the gunports were closed because they were under the waterline, because he had allowed the ship to be dangerously overloaded – Morga ordered the ''San Diego'' to ram the ''Mauritius'' and grapple it. Thirty soldiers and some sailors boarded the ''Mauritius'', taking possession of the forecastle and after-cabin and capturing the Dutch standard. The main and mizzen masts were stripped of sails and rigging. The Dutch retreated to the bow, where at first it seemed they were about to surrender. However, they soon renewed the fight with muskets and artillery.

An intense, six-hour hand-to-hand battle ensued, and many were killed on each side. The Dutch were said to have very few men left, and then the ''Mauritius'' caught fire. Fearing the fire, the ''San Diego'' recalled its men and cast off. However, the Spanish ship was taking on water and sinking, either from the ramming or from the artillery of the ''Mauritius''. (Accounts differ.)

The Dutch took this opportunity to extinguish the fire and set sail with the foresail, the only sail remaining, and with a skeleton crew. They eventually reached Borneo. The other Dutch ship, however, was captured by the ''San Bartolome''. It was taken to Manila, where the captain and the surviving sailors were garrotted on the orders of the governor.

The ''San Diego'' sank so quickly that the men for the most part were unable to disarm or abandon ship. Perhaps 350 men were lost. Morga swam for four hours, holding on to the Dutch standard, and made it to a small deserted island, where a few others of the ship's company also arrived.

This is based on the account of Morga, as published in his 1609 ''Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas.'' He blamed the captain of the ''San Bartolome'' for the loss of the ''San Diego'', because he had pursued the other Dutch ship rather than attacking the ''Mauritius''. The Dutch account of these events was very different, accusing Morga of incompetence and cowardice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vocshipwrecks.nl/out_voyages/hendrik_frederik.html Account of the battle between the ''San Diego'' and the ''Mauritius'', from a Dutch perspective] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302013742/http://www.vocshipwrecks.nl/out_voyages/hendrik_frederik.html |date=March 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, French explorers led by [[Franck Goddio]] excavated the sunken ''San Diego'' with its treasure.  Because of the large number of artifacts found with it (over 34,000), this was hailed as a great [[archaeological]] discovery. The artifacts included Chinese porcelain, [[celadon]] ware, Japanese [[katana]]s, Spanish [[Morion (helmet)|morion]]s, Portuguese cannons and Mexican coins. An MV ''San Diego'' warship museum has been constructed on Fortune Island to display and interpret many of the artifacts. This was the island reached by Morga and the other survivors of the ''San Diego''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasugbu.gov.ph/history.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821054417/http://www.nasugbu.gov.ph/history.htm |archivedate=2006-08-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In New Spain and Peru==
On July 10, 1603 Morga was reassigned to Mexico, in command of the ships sailing that year for New Spain. He became ''alcalde'' of criminal causes in the Royal Audiencia of Mexico City. He was also advisor to the viceroy on military matters and counsel for the [[Holy Office of the Inquisition]]. He served in Mexico until 1615, publishing his history of the Philippines in 1609, which has become noted for its account of the early colonial years and has been translated into numerous languages and published in many editions.

In 1615 he was named president of the Audiencia of [[Quito]], within the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]]. He arrived in [[Guayaquil]] on September 8, 1615, having narrowly escaped falling into the hands of Dutch corsairs off the island of Santa Clara. He took up his office in Quito on September 30, 1615. During his administration, the textile industry advanced and the University of San Gregorio Magno was founded. It was a time of confrontation between the civil and ecclesiastic powers, as well as disputes between the [[Creole peoples|Creole]] and [[Peninsular]] monks for control of the religious orders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lanic.utexas.edu/project/tavera/ecuador/intro.html], University of Texas&lt;/ref&gt; Although Morga was widely known to gamble extensively, have affairs with women, and conduct other questionable activities, he still achieved bureaucratic reforms, as well as of the liturgy, and helped improve treatment of the native peoples.&lt;ref name="cummins"/&gt;

In 1625 de Morga was investigated for corruption and arrested. On September 18, 1627 he was cleared of the charges and his offices were restored to him. He died in 1636. Except for the period 1625–27, he held the position of president of the Audiencia of Quito for 20 years, from 1615 until the year of his death. Most presidents of the Audencia served about 5 years.&lt;ref name="cummins"/&gt; Even as he aged, Morga pursued women. Shortly before his death in 1636, he was relieved of his duties. He was fined 2000 gold ducats for "having lewd relationships with much publicity and with many women".

==History of the Philippine Islands==
[[File:Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas.jpg|thumb|Title page of ''Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas''.]]

Morga suffered important failures in both his military and political capacities. The same cannot be said for his work as historian. In 1609, he published the work for which he is now remembered – ''Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas'' (''Events in the Philippine Isles''). This work, perhaps the best account of Spanish colonialism in the Philippines written during that period, is based partly on [[documentary research]], partly on keen observation, and partly on Morga's personal involvement and knowledge.

The history was published in two volumes, both in 1609 by Casa de Geronymo Balli, in Mexico City. (The work had circulated for years before this in manuscript form.) New Spain Viceroy [[Luis de Velasco, marqués de Salinas|Luis de Velasco (hijo)]] authorized the publication and granted Morga the sole right to publish it for ten years, on April 7, 1609. On the same date, Fray [[García Guerra]], archbishop of Mexico, approved the publication of the work. The history covers the years from 1493 to 1603. Political, social, and economic phases of life, both among the natives and their conquerors, are treated. Morga's official position allowed him access to many government documents.

The work greatly impressed Philippine independence hero [[José Rizal]] (1861–96), himself a man of letters and of action. He decided to annotate it and publish a new edition. He began work on this in London, completing it in Paris in 1890. He wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If the book (Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas) succeeds to awaken your consciousness of our past, already effaced from your memory, and to rectify what has been falsified and slandered, then I have not worked in vain, and with this as a basis, however small it may be, we shall be able to study the future.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.univie.ac.at/Voelkerkunde/apsis/aufi/rizal/hall03.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.univie.ac.at/Voelkerkunde/apsis/aufi/rizal/har-morg.htm About Rizal's ''Morga'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first English translation was published in London in 1868. Another English translation by [[Emma Helen Blair|Blair]] and [[James Alexander Robertson|Robertson]] was published in Cleveland in 1907,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor1-last = BLAIR | editor1-first = Emma Helen | editor1-link = Emma Helen Blair | editor2-last = ROBERTSON | editor2-first = James Alexander | editor2-link = James Alexander Robertson | others = Completely translated into English and annotated by the editors | title = The Philippine Islands, 1493–1898 | language = Spanish | volume = Volume 15 of 55 (1609) | publisher = [[Arthur H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4280">In [[English law]], '''baron and feme''' is a phrase used for [[husband]] and [[wife]], in relation to each other, who were accounted as one person by [[coverture]]. Hence, by the old law of evidence, the one party was excluded from giving evidence for or against the other in [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] questions, and a relic of this is still preserved in [[criminal law]].

==Heraldry==
In [[heraldry]], '''baron''' and '''femme''' are  terms denoting the two halves of an [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|heraldic escutcheon]] used when the [[coat of arms]] of a man and the paternal arms of his wife are [[impalement (heraldry)|impaled]] (or anciently dimidiated), that is borne ''per pale'' within the same [[escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]].&lt;ref name="Boutell1"&gt;{{ Citation | last=Boutell | first=Charles | lastauthoramp=yes | title=Heraldry, historical and popular | publisher=R.

Femme: the Wife as distinguished from the Baron her Husband. | page=106 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qlEBAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=Heraldry%20Historical%20%26%20Popular&amp;pg=PA106#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The position of the husband's arms, on the [[dexter and sinister|dexter]] side (to viewer's ''left''), the position of honour, is referred to as '''baron''' whilst the paternal arms of the wife are shown in [[dexter and sinister|sinister]], referred to as '''femme'''. The resultant shield is used by the husband, as in general females are not entitled to display heraldry, unless ''[[suo jure]]'' peeresses. This is the normal way of displaying the arms of a married man. Impalement is not used  when the wife is an [[heraldic heiress]], in which case her paternal arms are displayed on an [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|inescutcheon of pretence]] within her husbands' arms, denoting that the husband is a [[pretender]] to the paternal arms of his wife, and that they will be [[Quartering (heraldry)|quartered]] by the couple's issue and later descendants. Where arms are impaled for reasons other than ''conjugal'' marriage, for example the ''spiritual'' marriage of a bishop to his see or the ''mystical'' marriage of King Richard II to Saint [[Edward the Confessor]], the halves of the shield are referred to as simply [[dexter and sinister]].

==Etymology==
In late [[Latin]]  ''baro, baronis'', meant [[man]] (cf modern [[Spanish language|Spanish]] "varón" which means a [[male]]). Later, in Western Europe, the word was used to refer to a ruler's leading henchmen (e.g. a baron was the King's Man). Later, it came to have a specific, legal definition as the [[tenant-in-chief]] of the early Norman kings, which class developed into [[English feudal barony|feudal barons]] who held their lands from the king by the [[Feudal land tenure|feudal tenure]] ''per baroniam'' and were entitled to attend [[Parliament of England|parliament]].&lt;ref name="Sanders1"&gt;{{ Citation | last1=Sanders | first1=Ivor John | lastauthoramp=yes | title=Feudal Military Service in England: A Study of the Constitutional and Military Powers of the ''Barones'' in Medieval England | publisher=Greenwood Press | place= | volume= | edition= | year=1980 | quote=Part I, The ''Baro'' and the ''Baronia'' | page=100 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x6ugPwAACAAJ&amp;dq=Feudal+Military+Service+in+England:+A+Study+of+the+Constitutional+and+Military+Powers+of+the+Barones+in+Medieval+England&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MSfmT_uICcKC2AXLlqXaCQ&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Norman-French word ''feme/femme'' simply denotes "woman" or "wife".

'''Betty Jane Mitchell Gorin-Smith''', known as '''Betty Jane Gorin-Smith''' (born December 18, 1940), is an independent [[historian]] from [[Campbellsville, Kentucky|Campbellsville]] in [[Taylor County, Kentucky|Taylor County]] in central [[Kentucky]], best known for her book ''Morgan Is Coming!: Confederate Raiders in the Heartland of Kentucky'', a study of [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] [[General]] [[John Hunt Morgan]]'s raids in 1863 during the height of the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite book|url=http://warandgame.com/2007/12/15/book-review-morgan-is-coming-confederate-raiders-in-the-heartland-of-kentucky/|title=Morgan Is Coming: Confederate Raiders in the Heartland of Kentucky|location=[[Louisville, Kentucky]] |publisher=Harmony House Publishers|year=2006|ISBN=978-1-56469-134-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family and education==

Gorin-Smith was born in Campbellsville to the former Floye Minor (1917–2003) and David Heistand Mitchell (1919-1995). After Floye and David Mitchell divorced, Floye, a bookkeeper, in 1959 married Howard Smith&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campbellsville.com/wp/2003/04/23/floye-minor-smith/|title=Floye Minor Smith obituary|publisher=campbellsville.com|accessdate=February 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1906–1972),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/ssdi.cgi|title=Social Security Death Index|publisher=ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com|accessdate=February 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the owner of the Taylor County Stockyards. David H. Mitchell was a 1941 graduate in [[economics]] from [[Harvard College]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]]. He also attended the [[University of Minnesota]], where he studied [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. His business career was with the [[Timken Company]], which relocated him to [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]] and [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Ohio]]. A veteran of the [[United States Army]] in [[World War II]], he was a member of [[Mensa International|Mensa]] and the [[American Numismatic Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/KYTAYLOR/2004-03/1079211512|title=David H.

Betty Jane Mitchell graduated with [[Bachelor of Arts]] and [[Master of Arts]] degrees from the [[University of Kentucky]] at [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]]. She has also studied at [[Western Kentucky University]] in [[Bowling Green, Kentucky|Bowling Green]], [[Middle Tennessee State University]] in [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee|Murfreesboro]], [[Tennessee]], and the [[University of Virginia]] at [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]], [[Virginia (U.S. state)|Virginia]]. She formerly taught history for some three decades at [[Taylor County High School]] and at [[Southern Baptist]]-affiliated [[Campbellsville University]] in Campbellsville and [[United Methodist]]-affiliated [[Lindsey Wilson College]] in [[Columbia, Kentucky|Columbia]] in [[Adair County, Kentucky|Adair County]]. In 1987, she was a [[Fulbright program|Fulbright scholar]] to the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name=awards&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campbellsville.edu/Websites/cu/Files/Content/740887/cvilliansum04.pdf|title=Joan C.

Betty Jane Mitchell first married Donald L. Gorin (April 26, 1940 &amp;ndash; August 26, 2000), a Taylor County native and graduate of [[Campbellsville High School]] and [[Tennessee Tech University]] in [[Cookeville, Tennessee|Cookeville]], [[Tennessee]], where he played [[basketball]] and [[baseball]]. He served in the Kentucky National Guard. He was a partner in the firm Blevins-Gorin Construction Company and a founder of Wholesale Hardwood Interiors. In 1990, Don Gorin was named "Kentucky Entrepreneur of the Year" by the accounting firm, [[Ernst &amp; Young]]. The Gorins had a son, Mark Alan Gorin (born February 12, 1966) and wife, Deborah (born April 20, 1966), of [[Carmel, Indiana|Carmel]], Indiana, and a daughter, Beth G. Cox (born June 21, 1968) and husband Michael Todd Cox (born December 17, 1966), of [[Hendersonville, Tennessee|Hendersonville]], Tennessee.&lt;ref name=awards/&gt;&lt;ref name=dgorin&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/KYTAYLOR/2004-03/1079896325|title=Don Gorin obituary|publisher=archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com|accessdate=February 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Don Gorin also had a second son by a later marriage, Brandon Gorin, who resided in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], at the time of his father's death.&lt;ref name=dgorin/&gt;

After her divorce, Betty Gorin married Gordon E. Smith (born March 26, 1928), an instructor in the [[English as a Second Language]] program at Campbellsville University,&lt;ref name=awards/&gt; and hence acquired her hyphenated name. Gordon Smith edited his wife's book on General Morgan, which is considered exceptionally well-researched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Morgan-Coming-Confederate-Heartland-Kentucky/dp/1564691349|title=Morgan Is Coming!|publisher=Harmony House Publishers|accessdate=February 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Morgan Is Coming!==

On July 4, 1863, the day that the Confederates surrendered at [[Battle of Vicksburg|Vicksburg]], [[Mississippi]], and marched south in defeat from [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]], [[Pennsylvania]], another battle occurred beyond the line separating Taylor and Adair counties. This battle of Tebbs Bend launched General Morgan's Great Raid into [[Indiana]] and Ohio.&lt;ref name=tebbs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbiamagazine.com/index.php?sid=11137|title=Confederate troops marched across Tutt Street when it was just a path, May 25, 2004|publisher=columbiamagazine.com|accessdate=February 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Union Army|Union]] soldiers had crowded about the Adair County courthouse square in Columbia, as Confederate troops marched northward from [[Burkesville, Kentucky|Burkesville]] in [[Cumberland County, Kentucky|Cumberland County]] by what is now Kentucky Highway 704 and [[Kentucky Route 61]]. Tutt Street in Columbia was then the dividing line between the two armies. Mostly forgotten outside Kentucky, Tebbs Bend was among the bloodiest encounters of the war in the Western theater. Later [[governor of Kentucky|Governor]] [[James B. McCreary]], a Confederate [[major (rank)|major]], wrote in his diary: "Many of our best men were killed or wounded. The beginning of this raid is ominous." Tebbs Bend deflected the Confederates from proceeding to [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], which seemed as weakly defended at that time as [[Washington, D.C.]], had been in August 1814 during the [[War of 1812]].&lt;ref name=tebbs/&gt;

Jacob F. Lee in December 2007 reviewed Gorin-Smith's book for the [[Filson Historical Society]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

Gorin's most important contribution to the literature is a detailed study of south central Kentucky during the war. The work is most useful for the information Gorin collected about Taylor County and the surrounding area. While the narrative is sometimes bogged down with excessive detail, Kentucky historians and genealogists will find the book to be a gold mine of information. In addition to the narrative, Gorin put together several appendices listing Taylor County soldiers in the Civil War, casualties of the Battle of Tebb's Bend, official reports related to the battle, and period correspondence from Kentuckians who lived around Campbellsville. Gorin also includes extensive illustrations of persons and places referred to in the text. . . .

Gorin provides a well-documented history of the cavalryman's career in the area around Taylor County. However, she also raises many questions. While readers will learn much about Confederate raiders and guerrillas in the area, one wonders about the effects of the Union troops stationed in Taylor County. How did they interact with the community? Almost 10,500 slaves lived in the five counties Gorin studies. How did the demise of [[slavery]] affect whites and blacks in the area? That being said, Gorin has produced an informative study of the Civil War in south central Kentucky.&lt;ref name=book/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Campbellsville's "Factory"==

Gorin-Smith studied the impact of the [[Fruit of the Loom]] plant on Taylor County during the years from 1952 until layoff began in 1997, and the plant closed at the end of 1998. With [[overtime pay|overtime]] compensation, some factory workers made more money than schoolteachers, according to Gorin-Smith. "The Factory, as the townspeople called the company, earlier seemed the ticket to economic stability in Campbellsville. A victim of [[globalization]], the plant nevertheless shut down and moved to [[Latin America]], but [[Amazon.com]] moved into the community to replace some of the lost jobs. Not long afterward, another mainstay of the local economy, the [[Indiana]]-based [[Batesville Casket Company]], also closed its Campbellsville factory. Gorin-Smith observed that in the rural area surrounding Campbellsville "there are a lot of brick houses. I call those 'Fruit of the Loom' houses or 'Factory' houses. The men farmed, and the women worked at the factory. Factory money built those houses, not farm money."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/36/kentucky.html?page=0%2C1|author=Charles Fishman |title=Same Place, Different World |date=June 30, 2000|publisher=fastcompany.com|accessdate=February 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gorin-Smith recalls that the city of Campbellsville had planned to construct a sewer system to treat wastewater from the Fruit of the Loom plant. Then [[Mayor]] [[Robert L. Miller]] had consulted with William F. "Bill" Farley, who purchased the company in 1985. According to Gorin-Smith,  Farley promised Miller that the Campbellsville plant would remain operational. The closing, however, was completed as Miller, after thirty-three years in office, lost reelection in 1998 to [[Paul E. Osborne]], a Campbellsville [[Realtor]]. "That really hurt Bob to be betrayed like that," said Gorin-Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cknj.com/content/community-icon-dies-age-83

{{Politics of Bolivia}}

The '''Bolivian gas conflict''' was a [[social conflict|social confrontation]] in [[Bolivia]] reaching its peak in 2003, centering on the exploitation of the country's vast [[natural gas]] reserves. The expression can be extended to refer to the general conflict in Bolivia over the exploitation of gas resources, thus including the 2005 protests and the election of [[Evo Morales]] as president. Before these protests, Bolivia had seen a series of similar earlier protests during the [[Cochabamba Water War|Cochabamba protests of 2000]], which were against the [[privatization]] of the municipal [[water supply]].

==Overview==
The conflict had its roots in grievances over the government's economic policies concerning natural gas, as well as [[coca eradication]] policies, corruption and violent military responses against [[strike action|strike]]s. On a larger scale, it can be traced to [[History of Bolivia|Bolivia's]] [[colonialism|colonization]] since the 15th century and the subsequent exploitation of its [[natural resources]] (e.g., the mines of [[Potosí]]).

The "Bolivian gas war" thus came to a head in October 2003, leading to the resignation of President [[Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada]] (aka "Goni"). Strikes and road blocks mounted by [[Aymara people|indigenous]] and [[workers' movement|labour groups]] (including the [[Central Obrera Boliviana|COB]] trade union) brought the country to a standstill. Violent suppression by the Bolivian armed forces left some 60 people dead in October 2003, mostly inhabitants of [[El Alto]], located on the ''[[Altiplano]]'' above the capital city of [[La Paz]].

The governing coalition disintegrated forcing Goni to resign and leave the country on October 18, 2003. He was succeeded by the vice president, [[Carlos Mesa]], who put the gas issue to a [[Bolivian gas referendum, 2004|referendum]] on July 18, 2004. In May 2005, under duress from protesters, the Bolivian congress enacted a new hydrocarbons law, increasing the state's royalties from [[natural gas]] exploitation. However, protesters, who included [[Evo Morales]] and [[Felipe Quispe]], demanded full [[nationalization]] of [[hydrocarbon]] resources, and the increased participation of Bolivia's indigenous majority, mainly composed of [[Aymaras]] and [[Quechuas]], in the political life of the country. On June 6, 2005, Mesa was forced to resign as tens of thousands of protesters caused daily blockades to La Paz from the rest of the country. Morales' election at the end of 2005 was met with enthusiasm by the social movements, because he was, as the leader of [[left-wing]] [[Movement for Socialism (Bolivia)|MAS]], one of the staunchest opponents to the exportation of the gas without corresponding industrialization in Bolivia. On May 1, 2006, President Morales signed a decree stating that all gas reserves were to be nationalized: "the state recovers ownership, possession and total and absolute control" of hydrocarbons. The 2006 announcement was met by applause on La Paz's main plaza, where Vice President [[Álvaro García Linera|Alvaro Garcia]] told the crowd that the government's energy-related revenue would jump US$320 million to US$780 million in 2007,&lt;ref name="znet"&gt;{{Cite news | title=Nationalization of Gas! | date=May 4, 2006 | accessdate=2006-05-24 | publisher=[[Znet]] | url=http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=52&amp;ItemID=10202 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630181559/http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=52&amp;ItemID=10202 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=June 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; continuing a trend where revenues had expanded nearly sixfold between 2002 and 2006.&lt;ref name="May Day"&gt;{{Cite news | title=Bolivia's military takes control of gas fields | date=May 2, 2006 | accessdate=October 3, 2010 | publisher=[[Reuters]] | url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10379942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===Gas reserves of Bolivia===
{{see also|Geology of Bolivia}}
[[File:Bolivia indymedia guerradelgaz.jpg|thumb|right|1000px|2003 demonstrations against president [[Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada]]. "The gas is ours by right, to recover it is our duty."]]

The central issue was Bolivia's large natural gas reserves and the prospect for their future sale and use. The Bolivian gas reserves are the second largest in [[South America]] after [[Venezuela]], and exploration after the privatization of the national oil company [[YPFB]] showed that proven natural gas reserves were 600% higher than previously known. The cash-poor, state-owned company could not afford the exploration costs. These reserves mainly are located in the southeastern [[Tarija Department]], which contains 85% of gas and petrol reserves. According to the [[United States Department of Energy]], another 10.6% is located within the department of [[Santa Cruz Department (Bolivia)|Santa Cruz]] and 2.5% in the [[Cochabamba Department]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/cabs/Bolivia/NaturalGas.html United States Department of Energy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821222742/http://www.eia.doe.gov/cabs/Bolivia/NaturalGas.html |date=2008-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After further exploration from 1996 to 2002, the estimated size of the probable gas reserves was calculated to be 12.5 times larger, passing from {{convert|4.24|e12cuft|km3|abbr=on}} to {{convert|52.3|e12cuft|km3|abbr=on}}. This number has declined somewhat to {{convert|48|Tcuft|km3|abbr=on}} probable reserves. The proven reserves are {{convert|26.7|e12cuft|km3|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/cabs/Bolivia/NaturalGas.html US DoE] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821222742/http://www.eia.doe.gov/cabs/Bolivia/NaturalGas.html |date=2008-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the declining importance of [[tin]] mines, those reserves accounted for the majority of foreign investment in Bolivia. The price which Bolivia is paid for its natural gas is roughly US$3.25 to [[Brazil]] and $US3.18 to [[Argentina]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D8I25M200.htm?sub=apn_home_down&amp;chan=db Businessweek] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522144546/http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D8I25M200.htm?sub=apn_home_down&amp;chan=db |date=May 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources state that Brazil pays between US$3.15/MMBtu and US$3.60/MMBtu (not including US$1.50/MMBtu in [[Petrobras]] extraction and transportation costs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Luiz Rodolfo Landim Machado |title=Facing Market Risks in Brazil: the experience of the Bolivia – Brazil Gas Pipeline |publisher=In [[International Energy Agency|IEA]] – OLADE Latin American Conference on Cross-Border Gas Trade. |url=http://www.iea.org/dbtw-wpd/Textbase/work/2002/gastrade/Lrlandi.pdf |format=PDF |date=October 2002 |accessdate=2006-05-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060524231036/http://www.iea.org/dbtw-wpd/Textbase/work/2002/gastrade/Lrlandi.pdf |archivedate=2006-05-24 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The price of gas in the US as a whole is between US$5.85/MMBtu (May 21, 2006), US$7.90/MMBtu (April 2006)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nymex.com/ng_fut_csf.aspx NYMEX Gas Futures]&lt;/ref&gt; &amp; US$6.46/MMtu (June 2006),&lt;ref&gt;	[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20060606.RGAS06/TPStory/Business ''Globe and Mail'']{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; although several years ago the price of natural gas spiked at $14 in [[California]]&lt;ref name="Le Monde"&gt;{{cite news | title=Evo Morales et l'arme du gaz | publisher=[[Le Monde]] | date=January 25, 2006 | accessdate=2006-01-25 | url=http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3222,36-734335,0.html|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to lack of pipeline capacity to and within California as well as due to electricity outages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/steo/pub/special/california/june01article/canatgas.html US DOE],  [http://www.gasandoil.com/goc/news/ntn12206.htm gasandoil.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927185235/http://www.gasandoil.com/goc/news/ntn12206.htm |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While according to ''[[Le Monde]]'', Brazil and Argentina pay US$2 per thousand cubic meter of gas, which costs from $12 to $15 in California.&lt;ref name="Le Monde"/&gt;

In 1994, a contract with Brazil was passed, two years before 1996's privatization of the 70-year-old, state-owned ''Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales de Bolivia'' (YPFB). The construction of the [[GASBOL|Bolivia-Brazil gas pipeline]] cost US$2.2 billion.

A consortium called [[Pacific LNG]] was formed to exploit the newly discovered reserves. The consortium comprised the [[United Kingdom|British]] companies [[BG Group]] and [[BP]], and [[Spain]]'s [[Repsol YPF]]. Repsol is one of three companies that dominate the gas sector in Bolivia, along with Petrobras and [[Total S.A.|Total]].&lt;ref name="Le Monde"/&gt; A plan costing US$6 billion was drawn to build a pipeline to the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast, where the gas would be processed and [[Liquefied natural gas|liquefied]] before being shipped to [[Mexico]] and the [[United States]] ([[Baja California]] and California), through a Chilean port, for example [[Iquique]]. The 2003 Lozada deal was opposed heavily by Bolivian society, in part because of nationalism (Bolivia feels resentment after the territorial losses of the [[War of the Pacific]] in the late 19th century, which deprived it of the [[Antofagasta Region|Litoral province]] and hence access to the sea).

Government ministers hoped to use the gas profits to bolster the sagging [[Bolivian economy]] and claimed the money would be invested exclusively in health and education. Opponents argued that under the current law, the exportation of the gas as a raw material would give Bolivia only 18% of the future profits, or US$40 million to US$70 million per year. They further argued that exporting the gas so cheaply would be the latest case of foreign exploitation of [[Bolivia's natural resources]], starting with its silver and gold from the 17th century. They demanded that a plant be built in Bolivia to process the gas and that domestic consumption had to be met before export. As ''[[Le Monde]]'' puts it, "two reasons plead for the industrial exploitation of the gas, which the multinational companies now have the capacities of doing. The first is related to the necessity of satisfying the Bolivians' energy needs. The second demonstrates the interest of exporting a more profitable product rather than selling raw material". According to the French newspaper, only La Paz, El Alto, [[Sucre]], [[Potosí]], [[Camiri]] and [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra|Santa Cruz]] are now connected to the gas network; making an interior network which would reach all Bolivians would cost $1.5 billion, notwithstanding a central gas pipeline to link the various regions together. According to [[Carlos Miranda]], an independent expert quoted by ''Le Monde'', the best industrialisation project is the [[petrochemical]] complex proposed by the Brazilian [[Braskem]] firm, which would create 40 000 direct or indirect jobs and cost $1.4 billion. This figure is equivalent to the amount so far invested by Repsol, Total and Petrobras.&lt;ref name="Le Monde"/&gt;

=== Indigenous communities ===

[[File:El gas no se vende carajo.jpg|thumb|right|1000px|A [[graffiti|graffito]] roughly translating into ''"The gas is not for sale, dammit!"'', with an indigenous woman in the foreground.]]

Bolivia, like much of [[Latin America]], is a highly class-segregated society, in this case along ethnic lines: European-[[Indigenous people|Indio]]. European descendants tend to monopolize political and economic power and in fact the republican institutions are drawn along the lines of European schools of thought with little or no adjustment to the indigenous tradition. This makes it much harder for the indigenous to integrate into society and to achieve personal success. Since the late 1990s, the indigenous communities have become radicalized throughout the Andes, pressing for political reform in [[Peru]], [[Ecuador]] and Bolivia, loosely coordinated in the [[Pachacuti]] movement. The [[Movement for Socialism (Bolivia)|Movement Toward Socialism]] (MAS) is perhaps the strongest political expression of this movement in Bolivia, coordinating a wide range of community-based organizations mostly reflecting Aymara political aspirations.

=== Santa Cruz autonomy movement ===

The wealthier, eastern departments of [[Santa Cruz Department (Bolivia)|Santa Cruz]], [[Beni Department|Beni]], [[Tarija Department|Tarija]], and [[Pando Department|Pando]] recently had been mobilizing in favor of autonomy. Important issues were opposition to the seizure of resources though nationalization, the confiscation of land from local control by outside ethnic groups (mainly the Aymara and [[Quechua people|Quechua]]), and a greater share of taxes collected within Santa Cruz to support roads and schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4976104.stm BBC Bolivia gas move sparks hope and unease]&lt;/ref&gt; Community leaders are supported by the Comite Pro Santa Cruz, local co-ops, and by business organizations such as cattle ranchers and farmers. A strike against the new constitution was recently held which was observed in  Santa Cruz, Beni, Tarija, and Pando.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/5328900.stm]&lt;/ref&gt; Tensions have been raised by the cultural and philosophical rift exposed by the push for a new constitution. As a basis for a new constitution, the western, [[Altiplano]]-based MAS party envisions a "council of indigenous peoples" along with a curtailment of private ownership, while Santa Cruz looks to [[western culture]] and [[capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/functions/print.php?StoryID=20060910-111908-3913r]&lt;/ref&gt;
Cultural divisions exist because people in eastern Bolivia, called "Cambas" (meaning "friends" in [[Guarani language|Guarani]]), are primarily of [[mestizo]] descent (mix of European and several native tribes the largest of which are the Guaraní), while the western Altiplano is dominated by a small white elite and a historically oppressed Quechua and Aymara majority.

The first signs of the modern autonomy movement occurred in 2005 when a march for autonomy was attended by hundreds of thousands of people [https://web.archive.org/web/20080213184514/http://www.elmundo.com.bo/Secundarianew.asp?edicion=29%2F01%2F2005&amp;Tipo=Comunidad&amp;Cod=2510]. A result of this was the change in law to allow the election of departmental prefects. Another area of tension was the result of ongoing population shifts and the resulting demands for proportionally greater representation in Bolivia's Congress to reflect these shifts by Santa Cruz.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4277232.stm]&lt;/ref&gt; A compromise was reached to allow Santa Cruz to receive some of the seats warranted by population growth, and for the highlands to keep seats despite population losses.

Left-wing intellectuals [[Walter Chávez]] and [[Álvaro García Linera]] (the current Bolivian Vice President and MAS party member) published an article in the ''[[Monthly Review]]'' asserting that autonomy has been historically a demand of the Santa Cruz region, "contemporarily imbued with far-right, populist sentiments." They also qualified Santa Cruz autonomy as a "bourgeois ideology" of the "free market, foreign investment, racism, etc.", which pits the "modern", "whiter" Santa Cruz elite against the short, dark-skinned and [[anti-capitalist]] Aymara and Quechua peoples of the western region of Bolivia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monthlyreview.org/0905webber.htm "Left-Indigenous Struggles in Bolivia: Searching for Revolutionary Democracy"], by Jeffery R. Webber, ''[[Monthly Review]]'' September 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dispute over pipeline route===
The dispute arose in early 2002, when the administration of President [[Jorge Quiroga]] proposed building the pipeline through neighboring [[Chile]] to the port of [[Mejillones]], the most direct route to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. However, antagonism towards Chile runs deep in Bolivia because of the loss of Bolivia's Pacific coastline to Chile in the [[War of the Pacific]] (1879–1884).

Bolivians began campaigning against the Chilean option, arguing instead that the pipeline should be routed north through the [[Peru]]vian port of [[Ilo, Peru|Ilo]], 260&amp;nbsp;km further from the gas fields than Mejillones, or, better yet, first industrialized in Bolivia. According to Chilean estimates, the Mejillones option would be $600 million cheaper.
Peru, however, claimed the difference in cost would be no more than $300 million. Bolivian proponents of the Peruvian option say it would also benefit the economy of the northern region of Bolivia through which the pipeline would pass.

Supporters of the Chile pipeline argued that [[United States|U.S.]] financiers would be unlikely to develop processing facilities within Bolivia.

Meanwhile, the [[Peruvian government]], eager to promote territorial and economic integration, offered Bolivia a special economic zone for 99 years for exporting the gas at Ilo, the right of free passage, and the concession of a 10&amp;nbsp;km² area, including a port, that would be exclusively under Bolivian administration.

President Jorge Quiroga postponed the decision shortly before leaving office in July 2002 and left this highly contentious issue to his successor. It was thought Quiroga did not want to jeopardize his chances of re-election as president in the 2007 elections.

After winning the 2002 presidential election [[Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada]] expressed his preference for the Mejillones option but made no "official" decision. The Gas War led to his resignation in October 2003.

===Escalation===

[[File:Laguerradelgas.jpg|thumb|2003 Poster for a [https://web.archive.org/web/20070613150305/http://www.octubre2003.s5.com/ photo exhibition of the gas war]]]

The social conflict escalated in September 2003 with protests and road blockages paralyzing large parts of the country, leading to increasingly violent confrontations with the Bolivian armed forces.
The insurrection was spearheaded by Bolivia's indigenous majority, who accused Sánchez de Lozada of pandering to the US government's "[[war on drugs]]" and blamed him for failing to improve living standards in Bolivia. On September 8,650 Aymaras started a [[hunger strike]] to protest against the state detention of a villager. The man detained was one of the heads of the village, and was imprisoned for having sentenced to the [[death penalty]] two young men in a "community justice" trial.
On September 19, the National Coordination for the Defense of Gas mobilized 30,000 people in [[Cochabamba, Bolivia|Cochabamba]] and 50,000 in [[La Paz, Bolivia|La Paz]] to demonstrate against the pipeline.
The following day six Aymara villagers, including an eight-year-old girl, were killed in a confrontation in the town of [[Warisata]]. Government forces used planes and helicopters to circumvent the strikers and evacuate several hundred foreign and Bolivian tourists from Sorata who had been stranded by the road blockades for five days.

In response to the shootings, [[Central Obrera Boliviana|Bolivia's Labor Union]] (COB) called a general strike on September 29 that paralyzed the country with road closures.
Union leaders insisted they would continue until the government backed down on its decision.
Poorly armed Aymara community militias drove the army and police out of Warisata and the towns of Sorata and Achacachi, equipped only with traditional Aymara [[sling shot]]s and guns from the 1952 [[Bolivian National Revolution]].
Eugenio Rojas, leader of the regional strike committee, declared that if the government refused to negotiate in Warisata, then the insurgent Aymara communities would surround La Paz and cut it off from the rest of the country — a tactic employed in the [[Tupac Katari|Túpaj Katari]] uprising of 1781.
[[Felipe Quispe]], leader of the [[Indigenous Pachakuti Movement]] (MIP), stated that he would not participate in dialogue with the government until the military withdrew from blockaded areas. The government refused to negotiate with Quispe, claiming that he did not have the authority to represent the ''[[Peasant|campesino]]'' movement.

As the protests continued, protesters in [[El Alto]], a sprawling indigenous city of 750,000 people on the periphery of La Paz, proceeded to block key access routes to the capital causing severe fuel and food shortages. They also demanded the resignation of Sánchez de Lozada and his ministers, [[Yerko Kukoc]], Minister of Government, and [[Carlos Sánchez de Berzaín]], Minister of Defense, who were held responsible for the Warisata massacre. Protesters also voiced their opposition to the [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]] agreement that was at the time under negotiation by the US and [[Latin America]]n countries (since the November 2005 [[Mar del Plata Summit of the Americas]], it has been put on stand-by).

==Martial law in El Alto==

On October 12, 2003 the government imposed [[martial law]] in El Alto after sixteen people were shot by the police and several dozen wounded in violent clashes which erupted when a caravan of oil trucks escorted by police and soldiers deploying tanks and heavy-caliber machine guns tried to breach a barricade.

On October 13, the administration of Sánchez de Lozada suspended the gas project "until consultations have been conducted [with the Bolivian people]." However, Vice President Carlos Mesa deplored what he referred to as the "excessive force" used in El Alto (80 dead) and withdrew his support for Sánchez de Lozada. The Minister of Economic Development, Jorge Torrez, of the MIR party, also resigned.

The [[United States Department of State]] issued a statement on October 13 declaring its support for Sánchez de Lozada, calling for "Bolivia's political leaders [to] publicly express their support for democratic and constitutional order. The international community and the United States will not tolerate any interruption of constitutional order and will not support any regime that results from undemocratic means".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=Call for Respect for Constitutional Order in Bolivia | publisher=[[United States Department of State]] | date=October 13, 2003 | accessdate=April 2006 | url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2003/25144.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 18, Sánchez de Lozada's governing coalition was fatally weakened when the ''New Republic Force'' party withdrew its support. He was forced to resign and was replaced by his vice president, Carlos Mesa, a former journalist. The strikes and roadblocks were lifted. Mesa promised that no civilians would be killed by police or army forces during his presidency. Despite dramatic unrest during his time in office, he respected this promise.

Among his first actions as president, Mesa promised a referendum on the gas issue and appointed several indigenous people to cabinet posts. On July 18, 2004, Mesa put the issue of gas nationalization to [[Bolivian gas referendum, 2004|a referendum]]. On May 6, 2005, the Bolivian Congress passed a new law raising taxes from 18% to 32% on profits made by foreign companies on the extraction of oil and gas. Mesa failed to either sign or veto the law, so by law Senate President [[Hormando Vaca Diez]] was required to sign it into law on May 17. Many protesters felt this law was inadequate and demanded full nationalization of the gas and oil industry.

== The 2005 Hydrocarbons Law ==
On May 6, 2005 the long-awaited Hydrocarbons Law was finally approved by the Bolivian Congress. On May 17 Mesa again refused to either sign or veto the controversial law, thus constitutionally requiring Senate President [[Hormando Vaca Díez]] to sign the measure and put it into effect.

The new law returned legal ownership to the state of all hydrocarbons and natural resources, maintained royalties at 18 percent, but increased taxes from 16 to 32 percent. It gave the government control of the commercialization of the resources and allowed for continuous government control with annual audits. It also ordered companies to consult with indigenous groups who live on land containing gas deposits. The law stated that the 76 contracts signed by foreign firms must be renegotiated before 180 days. This has not yet been done. Protesters argued that the new law did not go far enough to protect the natural resources from exploitation by foreign corporations, demanding a complete [[nationalization]] of the gas and process in Bolivia.

Due to the uncertainty over renegotiation of contracts, foreign firms have practically stopped investing in the gas sector.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bl.html#Econ Central Intelligence Agency]&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign investment virtually came to a standstill in the second half of 2005. Shortages in supply  – very similar to those observed in Argentina after the 2001 price-fixing – are deepening in diesel, LPG, and begin to be apparent in natural gas. The May–June social unrest affected the supply of hydrocarbons products to the internal market, principally LPG and natural gas to the occidental region. Brazil implemented a contingency plan – led by the Energy and Mines Minister – to mitigate any potential impact from gas export curtailment. Although the supply was never curtailed, the social unrest in Bolivia created a strong sensation that security of supply could not be guaranteed. Occasional social action has continued to affect the continuity of supply, especially valve-closing actions.

== Carlos Mesa's June 2005 resignation ==

=== The protests ===

Over 80,000 people participated in the May 2005 protests. Tens of thousands of people each day walked from El Alto to the capital [[La Paz]], where protesters effectively shut down the city, bringing transportation to a halt through strikes and blockades, and engaging in street battles with police. The protestors demanded the [[nationalisation]] of the gas industry and reforms to give more power to the indigenous majority, who were mainly Aymaras from the impoverished highlands. They were pushed back by the police with [[tear gas]] and [[rubber bullet]]s, while many of the miners involved in the protests came armed with [[dynamite]].

May 24, 2005
More than 10,000 Aymara peasant farmers from the twenty highland provinces came down from ''[[El Alto]]'''s Ceja neighborhood into La Paz to protest.

On May 31, 2005 residents of El Alto and the Aymara peasant farmers returned to La Paz. More than 50,000 people covered an area of nearly 100 square kilometers. The next day, the first regiment of the National Police decided, by consensus, not to repress the protests and were internally reprimanded by the government.

On June 2, as the protests raged on, President Mesa announced two measures, designed to placate the indigenous protesters on the one hand and the Santa Cruz autonomy movement on the other: elections for a new constitutional assembly and a referendum on regional autonomy, both set for October 16. However, both sides rejected Mesa's call: the [[Pro-Santa Cruz Civic Committee]] declared its own referendum on autonomy for August 12, while in El Alto protesters began to cut off gasoline to La Paz.

Approximately half a million people mobilized in the streets of La Paz, on June 6, and President Mesa subsequently offered his resignation. Riot police used tear gas as miners amongst the demonstrators traditionally set off dynamite in clashes near the presidential palace, while a strike brought traffic to a standstill. However, Congress failed to meet for several days owing to the "insecurity" of meeting as protests raged nearby. Many members of Congress found themselves unable to physically attend the sessions. Senate President [[Hormando Vaca Díez]] decided to move the sessions to Bolivia's alternate capital, [[Sucre]], in an attempt to avoid the protesters. Radical farmers occupied oil wells owned by transnational companies, and blockaded border crossings. Mesa ordered the military to airlift food to La Paz, which remained totally blockaded.

Vaca Diez and House of Delegates president, [[Mario Cossío]], were the two next in the line of succession to become President. However, they were strongly disliked by the protesters, and each declared they would not accept succession to the Presidency, finally promoting [[Edwardo Rodriguez]], Supreme Court Chief Justice, to the Presidency. Considered apolitical and hence trustworthy by most, his administration was a temporary one until [[Elections in Bolivia|elections]] could be held. Protesters quickly disbanded in many areas, and like many times in Bolivia's past, major political upheavals were taken as a normal part of the political process.

Caretaker President Rodriguez proceeded to implement the Hydrocarbons Law. The new tax IDH has been levied from the companies that are paying 'under reserve'. A number of upstream gas companies have invoked Bilateral Investment Protection Treaties and entered the conciliation phase with the state of Bolivia. The treaties are a step towards a court hearing before the [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes]] (ICSID), dependent of the [[World Bank]], which could force Bolivia to pay indemnities to the companies.

== Concerns of possible US intervention ==
A military training agreement with [[Asunción]] ([[Paraguay]]), giving immunity to [[U.S. military|US soldiers]], caused some concern after media reports initially reported that a base housing 20,000 US soldiers was being built at [[Mariscal Estigarribia]] within 200&amp;nbsp;km of Argentina and Bolivia, and 300&amp;nbsp;km of Brazil, near an airport which could receive large planes ([[B-52]], [[C-130 Hercules]], etc.) which the Paraguayan Air Forces do not have.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=U.S. Military Moves in Paraguay Rattle Regional Relations |publisher=[[International Relations Center]] |date=December 14, 2005 |accessdate=April 2006 |url=http://americas.irc-online.org/am/2991 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5Ppo0hSpY?url=http://americas.irc-online.org/am/2991 |archivedate=2007-06-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clarin"&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/suplementos/zona/2005/09/11/z-03615.htm US Marines put a foot in Paraguay], [[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|El Clarín]], September 9, 2005 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]]'', an Argentinian newspaper, the US military base is strategic because of its location near the ''[[Triple Frontera]]'' between Paraguay, Brazil and Argentina; its proximity to the [[Guarani aquifer]]; and, finally, its proximity to Bolivia (less than 200&amp;nbsp;km) at the same "moment that Washington's magnifying glass goes on the ''[[Altiplano]]'' and points toward Venezuelan [[Hugo Chávez]] — the regional demon according to [[George W. Bush administration|Bush's administration]] — as the instigator of the instability in the region" (''Clarín''&lt;ref name="Clarin"/&gt;).

Later reports indicated that 400 US troops would be deployed in Paraguay over 18 months for training and humanitarian missions consisting of 13 detachments numbering less than 50 personnel each.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/suplementos/zona/2005/09/11/z-03615.htm link Clarín] [http://www.americas.org/item_23584 link Americas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060523193822/http://www.americas.org/item_23584 |date=2006-05-23 }} [http://www.brazzilmag.com/content/view/4732/53/ link Brazzil-Mag]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061203173821/http://www.brazzilmag.com/content/view/4732/53/ |date=2006-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Paraguayan administration as well as Bush's administration denied that the airport would be used as a US military base, or that there would be any other US base in Paraguay.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mre.gov.py/paginas/boletines/omc/anteriores/boletin23920052.asp link UltimaHora] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060519192110/http://www.mre.gov.py/paginas/boletines/omc/anteriores/boletin23920052.asp |date=2006-05-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The President of Paraguay similar statements  [https://web.archive.org/web/20060308093739/http://esp.mexico.com/notimexico/?method=una&amp;id=4459&amp;lang=eng link Mexico]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Further clarifications were made by US Embassy in Paraguay in July 2005  [http://asuncion.usembassy.gov/paraguay/Aclaracin_sobre_los_ejercicios_militares_conjuntos_entre_los_EE.UU._y_Paraguay.html link US-Embassy-Paraguay] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051226123427/http://asuncion.usembassy.gov/paraguay/Aclaracin_sobre_los_ejercicios_militares_conjuntos_entre_los_EE.UU._y_Paraguay.html |date=2005-12-26 }}, and repeated by other sources "Generally between 10 to 20 people, will train with their Paraguayan military colleagues during periods of two to six weeks....The American soldiers will not be deployed for extensive periods of time, and there will never be but a few dozen soldiers in Paraguay for no more than 45 days...The exercises will end by December 2006."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://americas.irc-online.org/am/2991  link IRC-Online]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5Ppo0hSpY?url=http://americas.irc-online.org/am/2991 |date=2007-06-24 }} [http://www.alternet.org/story/27775/ link Alternet]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other countries ==

The social conflicts of the last few years have paralyzed Bolivia's political life. The unpopularity of the neoliberal [[Washington consensus]], a set of economic strategies implemented by Gonzalo de Lozada's administration, set the stage for the 2006 election of president Evo Morales, the country's first indigenous president.

In the meantime, Chile promptly started to build several coastal terminals to receive shipments of [[LNG|liquefied natural gas]] from [[Indonesia]], [[Australia]] and other sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mundomaritimo.cl/noticias/noticia.asp?idNoticia=3530 |title=Terminal de gas y combustibles listo para operar |accessdate=2008-03-12 |author=Mundo Marítimo |authorlink=www.mundomaritimo.cl |date=2008-01-23 |language=spanish |quote=Terminal de gas y combustibles listo para operar }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other South American countries are contemplating other ways to secure gas supplies: one project aims at linking the [[Camisea Gas Project|Camisea gas reserves]] in [[Peru]] to Argentina, Brazil, Chile, [[Uruguay]] and [[Paraguay]]. Linking [[Pisco, Peru|Pisco]] (south of Peru) to [[Tocopilla]] (north of Chile) with a 1200&amp;nbsp;km pipeline would cost $2 billion. However, experts doubt the Camisea reserves are enough for all the [[Southern Cone]] countries.

Another 8,000&amp;nbsp;km gas pipeline ([[Gran Gasoducto del Sur]]) has been proposed that would link [[Venezuela]] to Argentina via Brazil. Its cost is estimated between $8 and $12 billion.

While Argentina and Chile are large consumers of gas (50 percent and 25 percent respectively), other South American countries are a lot less dependent.&lt;ref name="Le Monde"/&gt;

== Nationalization of natural gas industry ==

On May 1, 2006 president Evo Morales signed a decree stating that all [[geology of Bolivia|gas reserves]] were to be nationalized: "the state recovers ownership, possession and total and absolute control" of hydrocarbons. He thus realized his electoral promises, declaring that "We are not a government of mere promises: we follow through on what we propose and what the people demand". The announcement was timed to coincide with [[International Workers Day|Labor Day]] on May 1. Ordering the [[Military of Bolivia|military]] and engineers of [[YPFB]], the state firm, to occupy and secure energy installations, he gave foreign companies a six-month "transition period" to re-negotiate contracts, or face expulsion. Nevertheless, president Morales stated that the nationalization would not take the form of [[Nationalization|expropriation]]s or [[confiscation]]s. Vice President [[Álvaro García Linera|Álvaro García]] said in La Paz's main plaza that the government's energy-related revenue will jump to $780 million next year, expanding nearly sixfold from 2002.&lt;ref name="May Day"/&gt; Among the 53 installations affected by the measure are those of Brazil's [[Petrobras]], one of Bolivia's largest investors, which controls 14% of the country's gas reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=Bolivia gas under state control | date=May 2, 2006 | accessdate=2006-05-02 | publisher=[[BBC News]] | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4963348.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil's Energy Minister, [[Silas Rondeau]], reacted by considering the move as "unfriendly" and contrary to previous understandings between his country and Bolivia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=Ministro de Minas e Energia classifica decreto boliviano de "inamistoso" | date=May 2, 2006 | accessdate=2006-05-02 | publisher=[[Folha de Sao Paulo]] | url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/mundo/ult94u95494.shtml|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Petrobras, Spain's [[Repsol YPF]], UK gas and oil producer [[BG Group Plc]] and France's [[Total S.A.|Total]] are the main gas companies present in the country. According to [[Reuters]], "Bolivia's actions echo what Venezuelan President [[Hugo Chávez]], a Morales ally, did in the world's fifth-largest oil exporter with forced contract migrations and retroactive tax hikes — conditions that oil majors largely agreed to accept."  YPFB would pay foreign companies for their services, offering about 50 percent of the value of production, although the decree indicated that companies at the country's two largest gas fields would get just 18 percent.

Negotiations between the Bolivian government and the foreign companies intensified during the week leading up to the deadline of Saturday October 28, 2006. On Friday an agreement was reached with two of the companies (including [[Total S.A.|Total]]) and by the deadline on Saturday the rest of the ten companies (including [[Petrobras]] and [[Repsol YPF]]) operating in Bolivia had also come to an agreement. Full details of the new contracts have not been released, but the objective of raising government share of revenues from the two major fields from 60 percent to 82 percent seems to have been achieved. Revenue share for the government from minor fields is set at 60 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Morales' Gas Nationalization Complete |date=October 29, 2006 |accessdate=2006-10-31 |publisher=[[The Guardian|Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/worldlatest/story/0,,-6178277,00.html |location=London }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the six month negotiation period talks with the Brazilian company [[Petrobras]] had proven especially difficult. Petrobras had refused raises or reduction to a mere service provider. As a result of stalled talks Bolivian energy minister [[Andres Soliz Rada]] resigned in October and was replaced by [[Carlos Villegas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Bolivia agrees new energy deals |date=October 29, 2006 |accessdate=2006-10-31 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/worldlatest/story/0,,-6178277,00.html |location=London }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; "We are
obligated to live with Brazil in a marriage without divorce, because we both need each other", said [[Evo Morales]] in the contract signing ceremony underlining the mutual dependency of Brazil on Bolivian gas and of Bolivia on Petrobras in gas production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Morales' Gas Nationalization Complete |date=October 29, 2006 |accessdate=2006-10-31 |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/worldlatest/story/0,,-6178277,00.html |location=London }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reaction===

On December 15, 2007 the regions of Santa Cruz, Tarija, Beni, and Pando declared autonomy from the central government. They also moved to achieve full independence from Bolivia's new constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/americas/12/15/bolivia.unrest/?iref=mpstoryview  Four Bolivian regions declare autonomy from government]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Bolivian autonomy referendums, 2008}}

== The Protesters ==

=== Miners ===
Miners from the Bolivian trade union ''[[Central Obrera Boliviana]]'' (COB) have also been very active in the recent protests. Recently they have been active against propositions to privatize pensions. They have been known for letting off very loud explosions of dynamite in the recent protests.

=== Coca farmers ===
Shortly after the law passed, [[Evo Morales]], an Aymara Indian, ''cocalero'', and leader of the opposition party [[Movement for Socialism (Bolivia)|Movement Towards Socialism]] ('''MAS'''), took a moderate position calling the new law "middle ground". However, as the protests progressed, Morales has come out in favor of nationalization and new elections.

=== Protesters in Cochabamba ===
[[Oscar Olivera]] was a prominent leader in the 2001 protests in [[Cochabamba]] against the privatization of water in Bolivia and has also become a leading figure. Specifically the protesters in Cochabamba, Bolivia's fourth largest city, have cut off the main roads in the city and are calling for a new Constituent Assembly as well as nationalization.

=== Indigenous and peasant groups in Santa Cruz ===
Indians in the eastern lowland department of Santa Cruz have also become active in the recent disputes over nationalization of the gas and oil industry. They are composed of indigenous groups such as the [[Guarani people|Guaraní]], [[Ayoreo people|Ayoreo]], [[Chiquitano people|Chiquitano]] and the [[Guyarayos]], as opposed to the highland Indians (Aymara and Quechua). They have been active in recent land disputes and the main organization representing this faction is known as the "Confederacion de pueblos indigenas de Bolivia" (CIDOB). The CIDOB after initially offering support to MAS, the party of Bolivia's new president, have come to believe that they were deceived by the Bolivian government. [http://www.cidob-bo.org/] The MAS, which is based in the highlands, is no more willing to grant them voice than the previous governments whose power was also based from the highlands. Another smaller more radical group called the "Landless Peasant Movement" (MST) which is somewhat similar to the [[Landless Workers' Movement]] in Brazil, and is composed mainly of immigrants from the western part of the country. Recently, Guaraní Indians from this group have taken oil fields run by Spain's [[Repsol YPF]] and the United Kingdom's [[BP]] and have forced them to stop production.

=== Felipe Quispe and peasant farmers ===
[[Felipe Quispe]] is a radical Aymara leader who wishes to return control of the country from what he sees as the "white elite" to the indigenous Aymaran people who make up the majority of the country's population{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}. Therefore, he is in favor of an independent "Aymaran state". Quispe is the leader of the [[Pachakutik Indigenous Movement]], that won six seats in the Congress and the secretary general of the [[United Peasants Union of Bolivia]] in the 2002 Bolivian elections.

'''Carlos María de Bustamante Merecilla''' (4 November 1774 &amp;ndash; 29 September 1848) was a [[Mexico|Mexican]] statesman, historian, journalist and a supporter of [[Mexican War of Independence|Mexican independence]]. His historical "work early initiated an important Mexican national tradition of searching out and publishing basic materials on the Indian past and its fate in the [[New Spain|colonial period]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Howard F. Cline|Cline, Howard F.]], "Selected Nineteenth-Century Mexican Writers on Ethnohistory" in ''[[Handbook of Middle American Indians]], vol. 13, Guide to Ethnohistorical Sources, Pt. 2, p. 373.&lt;/ref&gt;  His writings in the 1820s shifted "the antiquarian bias of [[Criollo people|creole]] patriotism...into the ideology of a [[Wars of national liberation|national liberation]] movement."&lt;ref&gt;[[David Brading|D.A. Brading]], ''The First America: The Spanish Monarchy, Creole Patriots, and the Liberal State, 1492-1867''. New York: Cambridge University Press 1991, p. 636.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography and works==
Carlos María de Bustamante was born in the city of [[Oaxaca, Oaxaca|Oaxaca]] on 4 November 1774.&lt;ref&gt;Cline, "Selected Nineteenth-Century Mexican Writers on Ethnohistory" p. 371.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1796 he took up the study of law, participated in the attempts to secure [[Mexican War of Independence|Mexico's independence from Spain]], and, when that was finally achieved, opposed [[Agustín de Iturbide]]'s designs to transform the [[Provisional Government of Mexico (1823–24)|newborn republic]] into a [[First Mexican Empire|hereditary monarchy]]. Repeatedly imprisoned and banished, he was nevertheless appointed to important positions in the Government. The [[Mexican–American War|Mexican-American War]] of 1846-48 was a source of deep grief to him.

He founded the Mexican newspaper ''Diario de México'' in 1805 in which he expressed their independence liberal ideas and because this, he went to jail many times. After the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812|Cádiz constitution]] he founded the newspaper "El Juguetillo". In 1813 [[José María Morelos y Pavón]] named him as editor in the independence newspaper ''Correo Americano del Sur''.

Carlos María de Bustamante become deputy for the ''Provincia de Mexico'' in the [[Congress of Chilpancingo]] where he wrote the inaugural speech for Morelos, which "declared that the insurgents were about to free Mexicans from the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|chains of serfdom imposed on them in 1521]]."&lt;ref&gt;Brading, ''The First America'', p. 636.&lt;/ref&gt; Bustamante participated in the writing of [[1824 Constitution of Mexico|first Mexican Constitution]]. He spend most of the time between 1815 and 1822 in jail. In 1822, after Mexican independence was achieved, Bustamente was elected deputy of Oaxaca.

His historical sketch of The [[Mexican–American War|Mexican-American War]] is a sad record of the decay and disintegration which afflicted Mexico at the time. He writes with the greatest frankness, and unsparingly, about the conduct of the war on the Mexican side. His autobiography ''Lo que se dice, y lo que se hace, 1833'', published in 1833, is also valuable as a fragment of contemporary history.

Although constantly concerned in the politics of Mexico and occupying several very responsible positions during the most trying times of the Mexican Republic until the close of the war with the United States, Bustamante became a prominent Mexican historian. He distinguished himself by publishing historical works on colonial times, until then in manuscript and partly forgotten. Above all, his publication of ''[[Florentine Codex|Historia general de las cosas de Nueva España]]'', by Fray [[Bernardino de Sahagún]] of the second half of the 16th century, was a service to historical research.

In addition to the work of Sahagún, Bustamante printed the chronicle of [[Francisco López de Gómara|Gómara]], the work of Veytia on [[Texcoco (altepetl)|Tezcuco]], the dissertations of Gama on two large Mexican sculptures, and others. To the history by Sahagún he added one of the ''relaciones'' of [[Fernando de Alva Cortés Ixtlilxochitl|Fernando de Alva Ixtlixochitl]], selected by him for the passionate spirit which it displays against the Spaniards. Bustamante found the manuscript of exiled Mexican [[Jesuit]] [[Andrés Cavo]], ''Historia civil y política de México'' (''Civil and Political History of Mexico''), in Latin and Spanish.  Bustamante published it with a large appendix, under the title ''Los tres siglos de México bajo el gobierno español hasta la entrada del Ejécito Trigarante'' (''Three Centuries of Mexico Under the Spanish Government until the entry of the [[Army of the Three Guarantees]]''). The first edition was published in [[Mexico City]] in four volumes in 1836-1838. Bustamante also published a portion of Mariano Veytia's ''Historia antigua de México'', which Veytia based on manuscripts collected by [[Lorenzo Boturini]] de Benaducci.&lt;ref&gt; J. Benedict Warren, "An Introductory Survey of Secular Writings in the European Tradition on Colonial Middle America, 1503-1818, item 90, "Mariano Veytia (Mariano José Fernández de Echevarría Orcolaga, Alonso Linaje de Veytia)(1718-79) in ''Handbook of Middle American Indians, vol. 13. Guide to Ethnohistorical Sources'', Howard F. Cline, volume editor. Austin: University of Texas Press 1973, p.87.&lt;/ref&gt; Bustamante also published in defective form the eighteenth-century writings of Hipólito Villaroel, who wrote about the Spanish treatment of Indians, the colonial power structure regarding the Indians, and the "Indian problem" in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt; J. Benedict Warren, "An Introductory Survey of Secular Writings in the European Tradition on Colonial Middle America, 1503-1818, item 95. Hipólito Villroel (18th century)" in ''Handbook of Middle American Indians, vol. 13. Guide to Ethnohistorical Sources'', Howard F. Cline, volume editor. Austin: University of Texas Press 1973, p.90.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the autobiography mentioned, and the light shed by his other works, the ''Diccionario universal de Historia y Geografía'' (Mexico, 1853), contains an exhaustive account of the man. The historian [[Lucas Alamán]] wrote biographical material on Bustamante, putting in relief especially his private character and the virtues of his domestic life.

The '''Central American crisis''' began in the late 1970s, when major civil wars and [[communist revolution]]s erupted in various countries in [[Central America]], resulting in it becoming the number one region among US's [[foreign policy]] hot spots in the 1980s. In particular, the [[United States]] feared that victory by communist forces would isolate the rest of [[South America]] from the United States if the countries of Central America were to be installed with pro-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] communist governments. Throughout the second half of the nineteenth century, the United States often pursued their interests through puppet governments and the elite classes, who tended to ignore the demands of the peasant and working class.{{sfn|Weeks|1986}}

In the aftermath of the [[Second World War]] going into the 1960s and 1970s, Latin America's economic landscape changed drastically.{{sfn|Torres-Rivas|1981}} The United Kingdom and the United States both held political and economic interests in Latin America, whose economy developed based on external dependence.{{sfnm |1a1=Torres-Rivas |1y=1981 |2a1=Weeks |2y=1986}} Rather than solely relying on agricultural exportation, this new system promoted internal development and relied on regional common markets, banking capital, interest rates, taxes, and growing capital at the expense of labor and the peasant class.{{sfn|Torres-Rivas|1981}} The Central American Crisis was, in part, a reaction by the lower classes of Latin American society to unjust land tenure, labor coercion, and unequal political representation.{{sfn|Weeks|1986}} Landed property had taken hold of the economic and political landscape of the region, giving large corporations a lot of influence over the region and forcing formerly subsistent farmers and lower-class workers into very harsh living conditions.{{sfn|Weeks|1986}}

==Nicaragua==
{{Main|Nicaraguan Revolution}}

The [[Sandinista National Liberation Front]] (FSLN) overthrew the 46-year-long [[Somoza family|Somoza]] dictatorship in 1979.{{sfn|Marcus|1985}} However, the [[United States]] opposed the Nicaraguan revolution, and instead backed the Somoza dictatorship{{sfn|Marcus|1985}} and later the [[Contras]].

==El Salvador==
{{Main|Salvadoran Civil War}}
Fought between the [[military]]-led government of [[El Salvador]] and the [[Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front]] (FMLN), a coalition or umbrella organization of five [[left-wing]] militias.  Over the course of the 1970s, significant tensions and violence had already existed, before the civil war's full outbreak.

The United States supported the Salvadoran military government and supplied them with 4 billion dollars, trained their military elites, and provided them with arms over the course of a decade.{{sfnm |1a1=DiPiazza |1y=2008 |1p=32 |2a1="El Salvador" |3a1=Flemion |3a2=Browning |3a3=Santamaria Varela |3a4=Schultze-Kraft |3y=2018 |3loc=sec.&amp;nbsp;"Civil War"}}&lt;ref name="supply"&gt;{{cite magazine |date=16 March 1981 |title=Supply Line for a Junta |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,922440,00.html |magazine=Time |location=New York |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210235426/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,922440,00.html |archive-date=10 December 2008 |access-date=16 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel also actively supported the government forces and was El Salvador's largest supplier of arms from 1970 to 1976.{{sfn|"Statistics"|1978}} The conflict ended in the early 1990s. Between 75,000 and 90,000 people were killed during the war.{{sfn|Betancur|Figueredo Planchart|Buergenthal|1993}}{{verification needed|date=March 2018}}

==Guatemala==
{{Main|Guatemalan Civil War}}
Following a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]-backed [[1954 Guatemalan coup d'état|coup]] ousting [[Jacobo Arbenz]] in 1954, civil war ensued in [[Guatemala]] between 1962 and 1996.&lt;ref name="Lloyd 2013"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Lloyd |first=Siobhán |year=2013 |title=Guatemala |magazine=Socialist Lawyer |issue=64 |pages=38–40 |doi=10.13169/socialistlawyer.64.0038 |issn=0954-3635}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Guatemala, the [[Rebel Armed Forces]] (FAR) fighting against the government were based exclusively in rural areas, and were made up of a large peasant and indigenous population. They ran a multifaceted operation and led an armed mass struggle of national character.{{sfn|Torres-Rivas|1981}} Guatemala saw an increase in violence in the late 1970s, marked by the 1978 [[Panzós massacre]]. In 1982 the resurgent guerrilla groups united in the [[Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity]]. The presidency of [[Efraín Ríos Montt]] (1982&amp;ndash;1983), during which he implemented a strategy he called "beans and bullets", is widely considered{{by whom|date=November 2012}} the war's turning point. The Guatemalan government and the severely weakened guerrillas signed a peace agreement in December 1996, ending the war. Over 200,000 people died over the course of the civil war, disproportionately indigenous people targeted by the Ríos Montt headed military.&lt;ref name="Lloyd 2013"/&gt; On 10 May 2013, Ríos Montt was convicted of genocide and sentenced to 80 years in prison.&lt;ref name="Lloyd 2013"/&gt;

==Honduras==
Going into the '''Central American Crisis''', [[economy of Honduras|Honduras's economy]] was framed by stagnating agricultural production, [[de-industrialization]], deteriorating terms of trade, the continuing problems of the Central American common market, the decline of international financial reserves, salary decline, and increasing unemployment and underemployment.{{sfn|Rosenberg|1988}} [[Honduras]], like El Salvador, was increasingly dependent on economic assistance from the United States.{{sfn|Rosenberg|1988|page=3}} In Honduras, efforts to establish guerrilla movements foundered on the generally conservative attitude of the population. Nevertheless, fears that the civil wars wracking its neighbors might spread to the country led to the killings and [[forced disappearance|disappearances]] of leftists, spearheaded by the army's [[Battalion 3-16 (Honduras)|Battalion 316]]. Relatively stable Honduras became a key base for the [[presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]]'s response to the crisis. US troops held large military exercises in Honduras during the 1980s, and trained thousands of Salvadorans in the country. The nation also hosted bases for the Nicaraguan Contras.

==United States response==
*[[Operation Condor]]
*[[Caribbean Basin Initiative]]
*[[Reagan Doctrine]]

==Legacy==
By the late 1980s, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras all implemented reforms such as [[Privatization|privatizing]] state companies, liberalizing trade, introducing greater flexibility to labor laws, and increasing consumption taxes in attempts to stabilize their economies.{{sfn|Miguel Cruz|2015|pp=44–45}} {{As of|2015}}, violence still reigns over Central America.{{sfn|Miguel Cruz|2015|page=46}} A common legacy of the Central American crisis was the displacement and destruction of indigenous communities, especially in Guatemala where they were considered potential supporters of both the government and guerilla forces.&lt;ref name="Lloyd 2013"/&gt;

==Peace efforts==
Several Latin American nations formed the [[Contadora Group]] to work for a resolution to the region's wars. Later, [[Costa Rica]]n [[President of Costa Rica|President]] [[Óscar Arias]] succeeded in convincing the other Central American leaders to sign the [[Esquipulas Peace Agreement]], which eventually provided the framework for ending the civil wars.

[[File:Dio Chrysostom Orationes Johann Jacob Reiske 1784 page 43.jpg|right|thumb|''Orations'' of Dio Chrysostom edited by [[Johann Jakob Reiske]], 1784. Oration 1, ΠΕΡΙ ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΑΣ (''On Kingship'')]]
'''Dio Chrysostom''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|iː|oʊ|_|ˈ|k|r|ɪ|s|ə|s|t|ə|m|,_|k|r|ɪ|ˈ|s|ɒ|s|t|ə|m}}; {{lang-el|[[wikt:Δίων|Δίων]] Χρυσόστομος}} ''Dion Chrysostomos''), '''Dion of Prusa''' or '''Dio Cocceianus''' (c. 40 – c. 115 AD), was a [[Greece|Greek]] orator, writer, philosopher and historian of the [[Roman Empire]] in the 1st century.  Eighty of his ''Discourses'' (or ''Orations''; {{lang|grc|Λόγοι}}) are extant, as well as a few Letters and a funny mock essay "In Praise of Hair", as well as a few other fragments. His surname ''Chrysostom'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''chrysostomos'' (χρυσόστομος), which literally means "golden-mouthed". He should not be confused with the Roman historian [[Cassius Dio]], nor with the 4th-century bishop [[John Chrysostom]] of Constantinople.

==Life==
He was born at Prusa (now [[Bursa]]) in the Roman province of [[Bithynia]] (now part of northwestern [[Turkey]]). His father, Pasicrates, seems to have bestowed great care on his son Dio's education and the early training of his mind. At first he occupied himself in his native place, where he held important offices, with the composition of speeches and other [[rhetorical]] and [[sophism|sophistical]] essays, but he later devoted himself with great zeal to the study of [[philosophy]]. He did not, however, confine himself to any particular sect or school, nor did he give himself up to any profound speculations, his object being rather to apply the doctrines of philosophy to the purposes of practical life, and more especially to the administration of public affairs, and thus to bring about a better state of things. The [[Stoicism|Stoic]] and [[Middle Platonism|Platonist]] philosophies, however, appear to have had the greatest charms for him. 

He went to [[Rome]] during [[Vespasian]]'s reign (69–79 AD), by which time he seems to have got married and had a child.&lt;ref&gt;Dio Chrysostom, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dio_Chrysostom/Discourses/46*.html#13 ''Orat.'' xlvi. 13]&lt;/ref&gt; He became a critic of the Emperor [[Domitian]],&lt;ref&gt;Dio Chrysostom, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dio_Chrysostom/Discourses/3*.html#13 ''Orat.'' iii. 13]&lt;/ref&gt; who banished him from Rome, [[Italy]], and Bithynia in 82 for advising one of the Emperor's conspiring relatives.&lt;ref&gt;Dio Chrysostom, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dio_Chrysostom/Discourses/13*.html#1 ''Orat.'' xiii. 1]&lt;/ref&gt; On the advice of the [[Delphic oracle]],&lt;ref&gt;Dio Chrysostom, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dio_Chrysostom/Discourses/13*.html#9 ''Orat.'' xiii. 9]&lt;/ref&gt; he put on the clothes of a [[beggar]],&lt;ref&gt;Dio Chrysostom, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dio_Chrysostom/Discourses/13*.html#11 ''Orat.'' xiii. 11]&lt;/ref&gt; and with nothing in his pocket but a copy of [[Plato]]'s [[Phaedo]] and [[Demosthenes]]'s oration on [[On the False Embassy|the ''Embassy'']], he lived the life of a [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]] philosopher, undertaking a journey to the countries in the north and east of the [[Roman empire]]. He thus visited [[Thrace]], [[Mysia]], [[Scythia]], and the country of the [[Getae]],&lt;ref&gt;Dio Chrysostom, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dio_Chrysostom/Discourses/12*.html#16 ''Orat.'' xii. 16]&lt;/ref&gt; and owing to the power and wisdom of his orations, he met everywhere with a kindly reception, and did much good.&lt;ref&gt;Dio Chrysostom, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dio_Chrysostom/Discourses/36*.html ''Orat.'' xxxvi.]; comp. [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dio_Chrysostom/Discourses/13*.html#11 ''Orat.'' xiii. 11 ff.]&lt;/ref&gt; He was a friend of [[Nerva]],&lt;ref&gt;Dio Chrysostom, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dio_Chrysostom/Discourses/45*.html#2 ''Orat.'' xlv. 2]&lt;/ref&gt; and when Domitian was murdered in 96 AD, Dio used his influence with the [[Roman army|army]] stationed on the frontier in favour of Nerva. Under Emperor Nerva's reign, his exile was ended, and he was able to return home to Prusa. He adopted the surname Cocceianus in later life to honour the support given to him by the emperor,&lt;ref name="pliny1"&gt;Pliny, ''Epistles,'' [http://www.attalus.org/old/pliny10b.html#81 x. 81]&lt;/ref&gt; whose full name was Marcus Cocceius Nerva. Nerva's successor, [[Trajan]], entertained the highest esteem for Dio,&lt;ref&gt;Dio Chrysostom, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dio_Chrysostom/Discourses/3*.html#2 ''Orat.'' iii. 2]&lt;/ref&gt; and showed him the most marked favour. His kindly disposition gained him many eminent friends, such as [[Apollonius of Tyana]] and [[Euphrates the Stoic|Euphrates of Tyre]], and his oratory the admiration of all. In his later life Dio had considerable status in Prusa, and there are records of him being involved in an urban renewal lawsuit about 111.&lt;ref name="pliny1"/&gt; He probably died a few years later.

==Writings==
Dio Chrysostom was part of the [[Second Sophistic]] school of Greek philosophers which reached its peak in the early 2nd century. He was considered as one of the most eminent of the Greek [[rhetoric]]ians and [[sophists]] by the ancients who wrote about him, such as [[Philostratus]],&lt;ref name="philost1"&gt;Philostratus, ''Vitae sophistorum'' i.7&lt;/ref&gt; [[Synesius]],&lt;ref&gt;Synesius, ''Dion''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]].&lt;ref&gt;Photius, ''Bibl.'' Cod. 209&lt;/ref&gt; This is confirmed by the eighty orations of his which are still extant, and which were the only ones known in the time of Photius. These orations appear to be written versions of his oral teaching, and are like essays on political, moral, and philosophical subjects. They include four orations on [[Kingship]] addressed to [[Trajan]] on the virtues of a sovereign; four on the character of [[Diogenes of Sinope]], on the troubles to which men expose themselves by deserting the path of [[Nature]], and on the difficulties which a sovereign has to encounter; essays on [[slavery]] and [[Political freedom|freedom]]; on the means of attaining eminence as an [[orator]]; [[political]] discourses addressed to various [[town]]s which he sometimes praises and sometimes blames, but always with moderation and wisdom; on subjects of [[ethics]] and practical philosophy, which he treats in a popular and attractive manner; and lastly, orations on [[mythical]] subjects and show-speeches. He argued strongly against permitting [[prostitution]].&lt;ref&gt;Dio Chrysostom, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dio_Chrysostom/Discourses/7*.html#133 ''Orat.'' vii.133‑152]&lt;/ref&gt; He also claimed that the epics of [[Homer]] had been translated and were sung  in [[India]];&lt;ref&gt;Dio Chrysostom, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dio_Chrysostom/Discourses/53*.html#6 ''Orat.'' liii. 6-8]&lt;/ref&gt; this is unlikely to be true, and there may have been confusion with the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' and the ''[[Ramayana]]'', of which there are some parallels in subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;McEvilley, T., (2002), ''The Shape of Ancient Thought: Comparative Studies in Greek and Indian Philosophies'', page 387. Allworth Communications.&lt;/ref&gt; Two orations of his (37 and 64) are now assigned to [[Favorinus]]. Besides the eighty orations we have fragments of fifteen others, and there are extant also five letters under Dio's name. 

He wrote many other philosophical and historical works, none of which survive. One of these works, [[Getica (Dio)|Getica]], was on the [[Getae]],&lt;ref name="philost1"/&gt; which the [[Suda]] incorrectly attributes to [[Dio Cassius]].&lt;ref&gt;Suda, ''Dion''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
He was born in Lagos to businessman Peter John Claudius Thomas and Josetta Mary Thomas (née Cole).&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;{{cite web|title=Thomas, (Emanuel) Peter John Adeniyi (1914-1945), air force officer|website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His older sibling was [[Stella Thomas]], first woman magistrate in West Africa. He attended [[King's College, Lagos]] and worked for his father before joining the Labour Department of the Nigerian Government.

==RAF career==
Thomas was inspired to join the Royal Air Force (RAF) after reading about [[Battle of Britain|The Battle of Britain]].&lt;ref name="Bourne"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bourne|first1=Stephen|title=Motherland Calls: Britain's Black Servicemen &amp; Women, 1939-45|publisher=The History Press, 2012|isbn=9780752490717|pages=IV - V}}&lt;/ref&gt; His application to the RAF was supported by Charles Woolley, the chief secretary to the government of Nigeria, who personally forwarded Thomas's application to London.&lt;ref name="Bourne" /&gt; Writing about his partial inspiration to join the RAF, Thomas noted:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''"My great-grandfather was a chieftain. One day his rival betrayed him to a slave dealer. He was put on a ship along with 100 other slaves and was soon on his way to America.

{{Refimprove|date=August 2016}}
"'''Factory'''" (from [[Latin]] ''facere'', meaning "to do"; {{lang-pt|'''feitoria'''}}, {{lang-nl|'''factorij'''}}, {{lang-fr|'''factorerie'''}}, {{lang|fr|'''comptoir'''}}) was the common name during the [[medieval]] and [[early modern]] eras for an [[entrepôt]] – which was essentially an early form of [[free-trade zone]] or [[transshipment]] point. At a factory, local inhabitants could interact with foreign merchants, often known as [[factor (agent)|factors]].&lt;ref&gt;Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language, Portland House, New York, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; First established in Europe, factories eventually spread to many other parts of the world.

The factories established by European states in [[Africa]], [[Asia]] and [[the Americas]] from the [[15th century]] onward also tended to be official political [[Dependent territory|dependencies]] of those states. These have been seen, in retrospect, as the precursors of [[colonialism|colonial expansion]].  

A factory could serve simultaneously as [[market (place)|market]], [[warehouse]], [[customs]], defense and support to [[navigation]] [[exploration]], headquarters or ''[[de facto]]'' government of local communities.

In [[North America]], Europeans began to interact with [[North American fur trade|pre-existing native American trade systems]] during the 16th century. Colonists created factories, known as [[trading post]]s, at which furs could be traded, in [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] territory.

==European medieval factories==
[[File:Haupthandelsroute Hanse.png|thumb|Main trading routes of the [[Hanseatic League]].]]
[[File:Hansehausantwerpen.jpg|thumb|The [[Oostershuis]], a [[Kontor]] in Antwerp]]
Although European [[colonialism]] traces its roots from the [[Classical antiquity|classical era]], when [[Phoenicia]]ns, [[ancient Greeks|Greeks]] and [[ancient Romans|Romans]] established [[settler colony|colonies of settlement]] around the [[Mediterranean]] &amp;ndash; "factories" were a unique institution born in [[medieval]] Europe.

Originally, factories were organizations of European merchants from a state, meeting in a foreign place. These organizations sought to defend their common interests, mainly economic (as well as organized insurance and protection), enabling the maintenance of diplomatic and trade relations within the foreign state where they were set.

The factories were established from 1356 onwards in the main trading centers, usually ports or central hubs that have prospered under the influence of the [[Hanseatic League]] and its [[guild]]s and [[kontor]]s. The Hanseatic cities had their own law system and furnished their own protection and mutual aid. The Hanseatic League maintained factories, among others, in England ([[Boston, Lincolnshire|Boston]], [[King's Lynn]]), Norway ([[Tønsberg]]) and Finland ([[Åbo]]). Later, cities like [[Bruges]] and [[Antwerp]] actively tried to take over the monopoly of trade from the Hansa, inviting foreign merchants to join in.

Because foreigners were not allowed to buy land in these cities, merchants joined around factories, like the Portuguese in their Bruges factory: the factor(s) and his officers rented the housing and warehouses, arbitrated trade, and even managed insurance funds, working both as an association and an embassy, even administering justice within the merchant community.&lt;ref&gt;Diogo Ramada Curto, Francisco Bethencourt, "O tempo de Vasco da Gama", DIFEL, 1998, {{ISBN|972-8325-47-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portuguese Feitorias (c. 1445)==

During the territorial and economic expansion of the [[Age of Discovery]], the factory was adapted by the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] and spread throughout from West Africa to Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 314&amp;ndash;315&lt;/ref&gt; The Portuguese ''feitorias'' were mostly fortified trading posts settled in coastal areas, built to centralize and thus dominate the local trade of products with the Portuguese kingdom (and thence to Europe). They served simultaneously as [[market (place)|market]], [[warehouse]], support to the [[navigation]] and [[customs]] and were governed by a ''feitor'' ("factor") responsible for managing the trade, buying and trading products on behalf of the king and collecting taxes (usually 20%).

[[File:ElminaCastle1668.jpg|thumb|left|Elmina Castle viewed from the sea in 1668]]
The first Portuguese ''feitoria'' overseas was established by [[Henry the Navigator]] in 1445 on the island of [[Arguin]], off the coast of Mauritania. It was built to attract Muslim traders and monopolize the business in the routes traveled in North Africa. It served as a model for a chain of African ''feitorias'', [[Elmina Castle]] being the most notorious.

Between the 15th and 16th centuries, a chain of about 50 [[Portuguese Forts|Portuguese forts]] either housed or protected ''feitorias'' along the coasts of West and East Africa, the Indian Ocean, China, Japan, and South America. The main Portuguese factories were in [[Goa]], [[Portuguese Malacca|Malacca]], [[Ormuz]], [[Ternate]], and [[Portuguese Macau|Macau]]. They were mainly driven by the trade of gold and slaves on the [[Gulf of Guinea|coast of Guinea]], spices in the Indian Ocean, and sugar cane in the New World. They were also used for local [[triangular trade]] between several territories, like Goa-Macau-Nagasaki, trading products such as sugar, pepper, coconut, timber, horses, grain, feathers from exotic Indonesian birds, precious stones, silks and porcelain from the East, among many other products. In the Indian Ocean, the trade in Portuguese factories was enforced and increased by a merchant ship licensing system: the [[cartaz]]es.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 320&amp;ndash;322&lt;/ref&gt;

From the ''feitorias'', the products went to the main outpost in Goa, then to Portugal where they were traded in the [[Casa da Índia]], which also managed exports to India.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], p. 316&lt;/ref&gt; There they were sold, or re-exported to the Royal Portuguese Factory in [[Antwerp]], where they were distributed to the rest of Europe.

Easily supplied and defended by sea, the factories worked as independent colonial bases. They provided safety, both for the Portuguese, and at times for the territories in which they were built, protecting against constant rivalries and piracy. They allowed Portugal to dominate trade in the Atlantic and Indian oceans, [[Portuguese empire|establishing a vast empire]] with scarce human and territorial resources. Over time, the ''feitorias'' were sometimes licensed to private entrepreneurs, giving rise to some conflict between abusive private interests and local populations, such as in the [[Maldives]].

==Dutch ''factorij'' and other European factories (1600s)==
[[File:De handelsloge van de VOC in Hougly in Bengalen Rijksmuseum SK-A-4282.jpeg|thumb|Dutch V.O.C. factory in [[Hugli-Chuchura]], Bengal, in 1665]]
[[File:Nagasaki bay siebold.jpg|thumb|[[Dejima]] island in [[Nagasaki]] Bay, first Portuguese and then Dutch factory]]
[[File:Hongs at Canton.jpg|thumb|right|[[Guangzhou|Canton]] "[[Thirteen Factories]]", c. 1820]]
Other European powers began to establish factories in the 17th century along the trade routes explored by Portugal and Spain, first the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] and then the [[England|English]]. They went on to establish in conquered Portuguese ''feitorias'' and further enclaves, as they explored the coasts of Africa, Arabia, India, and South East Asia in search of the source of the lucrative [[spice trade]].

Factories were then established by [[chartered company|chartered companies]] such as the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC), founded in 1602, and the [[Dutch West India Company]] (WIC), founded in 1621. These factories provided for the exchange of products among European companies, local populations, and the colonies that often started as a factory with warehouses. Usually these factories had larger warehouses to fit the products resulting from the increasing agricultural development of colonies, which were boosted in the [[New World]] by the [[Atlantic slave trade]].

In these factories, the products were checked, weighed, and packaged to prepare for the long sea voyage. In particular, spices, [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[tea]], [[tobacco]], [[coffee]], [[sugar]], [[porcelain]], and [[fur]] were well protected against the salty sea air and against deterioration. The factor was present as the representative of the trading partners in all matters, reporting to the headquarters and being responsible for the products’ logistics (proper storage and shipping). Information took a long time to reach the company headquarters, and this was dependent on an absolute trust.

Some Dutch factories were located in [[Cape Town]] in modern-day South Africa,  [[Mocha, Yemen|Mocha]] in Yemen, [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] and the [[Coromandel Coast]] in southern India, [[Colombo]] in Sri Lanka, [[Ambon, Maluku|Ambon]] in Indonesia,  [[Fort Zeelandia (Taiwan)|Fort Zeelandia]] in Taiwan, [[Guangzhou|Canton]] in southern China, [[Dejima]] Island in Japan (the only legal point of trade between Japan and the outside world during the [[Edo Period]]), and [[Fort Orange (New Netherland)|Fort Orange]] in modern-day [[Upstate New York]] in the United States.

==North American factories (1697 to 1822)==

The American factories often played a strategic role as well, sometimes operating as forts, providing a degree of protection for colonists and their allies from hostile Indians and foreign colonists. 
[[File:HS34 1.jpg|left|thumb|[[York Factory]], Manitoba, in 1853]]
[[File:Fort-osage.jpg|left|thumb|The factory trading post building at [[Fort Clark, Missouri|Fort Clark]] on the left, which in turn was within a walled fort]]

[[York Factory]] was founded by the [[chartered company|chartered]] [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in 1697.&lt;!--other factories in HBC turf/history to be added--&gt; It was headquarters of the company for a long time, and was once the ''de facto'' government in parts of North America such as [[Rupert's Land]], before European-based colonies existed. It controlled the [[fur trade]] throughout much of British-controlled North America for several centuries, undertaking early exploration. Its traders and trappers forged early relationships with many groups of American Indians, and a network of trading posts formed the nucleus for later official authority in many areas of Western Canada and the United States.

The early coastal factory model contrasted with the system of the French, who established an extensive system of inland posts and sent traders to live among the tribes of the region. War broke out in Europe between France and England in the 1680s, and the two nations regularly sent expeditions to raid and capture each other's fur trading posts. In March 1686, the French sent a raiding party under Chevalier des Troyes over {{convert|1,300|km|mi|abbr=on}} to capture the company's posts along James Bay. In 1697, [[Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville]], commander of the company's captured posts, defeated three ships of the Royal Navy in the [[Battle of Hudson's Bay|Battle of the Bay]] on his way to [[Capture of York Factory|capture York Factory]] by a ruse. York Factory changed hands several times in the next decade and was finally ceded permanently in the 1713 [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Treaty of Utrecht]]. After the treaty, the Hudson Bay Company rebuilt [[York Factory, Manitoba|York Factory]] as a brick [[star fort]] at the mouth of the nearby [[Hayes River]], its present location.

The United States government sanctioned a factory system from 1796 to 1822, with factories scattered through the mostly territorial portion of the country.

The factories were officially intended to protect [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] from exploitation through a series of legislation called the [[Indian Intercourse Act]]s. However, in practice, numerous tribes conceded extensive territory in exchange for the trading posts, as happened in the [[Treaty of Fort Clark]] in which the [[Osage Nation]] ceded most of [[Missouri]] at [[Fort Osage|Fort Clark]].

A [[blacksmith]] was usually assigned to the factory to repair utensils and build or maintain plows.  The factories frequently also had some sort of milling operation associated with them.

The factories marked the United States' attempt to continue a process originally pioneered by the [[France|French]] and then by the [[Spain|Spanish]] to officially license the fur trade in [[Upper Louisiana]].

Factories were frequently called "[[fort]]s" and often had numerous unofficial names. Legislation was often passed calling for military [[garrison]]s at the fort but their de facto purpose was a trading post.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2746">[[File:FranzBollBernhardReinhold1874.JPG|right|thumb|Franz Boll (1874)]]
'''Franz Christian Boll''' (17 October 1805, [[Neubrandenburg]] – 20 March 1875) was a [[Lutheran]] [[theologian]] and historian. He was the father of [[physiologist]] [[Franz Christian Boll]] (1849–1879), and the brother of [[naturalist]] [[Ernst Boll]] (1817–1868), with whom he collaborated throughout his career.

He studied theology in [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]], Berlin and [[Rostock]], and in 1835 returned to Neubrandenburg as a pastor and school teacher. In 1866 he became [[Provost (religion)|"Praepositus"]] of the Neubrandenburg Synod.

As a historian, Boll dealt largely with the history of the [[Mecklenburg]] region in Germany. This work involved investigations of documented information contained in various towns and churches, including intensive study on the history of Neubrandenburg and the Broda [[monastery]]. His two-volume work, ''Geschichte der Lande Stargard bis 1470'', was an historical account of Mecklenburg-Stargard prior to the year 1470. Boll also performed  [[archaeology|archaeological]] research in the Mecklenburg region, and with his brother, he collaborated on ''Die Geschichte Mecklenburgs, mit besonderer Berücksichtigung der Culturgeschichte'', a two-volume treatise involving the history of Mecklenburg, with particular attention given to its [[cultural history]].

Boll was an active member of the ''Neubrandenburger Reformbewegung'', a confederation that was part of the [[Revolutions of 1848|reform movement of 1848]]. As his career progressed, he became good friends with novelist [[Fritz Reuter]] (1810–1874).

'''Ghazni Minarets''' are two elaborately decorated [[minaret]] towers located in [[Ghazni]] city, central [[Afghanistan]]. They were built in middle of the twelfth century and are the only surviving elements of the mosque of Bahram Shah.&lt;ref name="LaterGhaznavidsBook"&gt;C.E. Bosworth, ''The Later Ghaznavids'', (Columbia University Press, 1977), 115.&lt;/ref&gt; The two minarets are 600 meters (1968 feet) apart and lie in an open plain, east of Ghazni city.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |title=Ghazni Towers Documentation Project: History |url=https://eca.state.gov/files/bureau/ghazni-towers/historyb.html |website=eca.state.gov |accessdate=19 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Both minarets of Ghazni are 20 metres (66 feet)&lt;ref name="aa"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; tall and built of fired mud [[brick]]. The surface of the towers are decorated beautifully with intricate geometric patterns and [[Quran|Qurunic]] verses on elaborate [[terracotta]] tiles. In 1960's, both towers were fitted with sheet metal roofs in a limited preservation effort.&lt;ref name="aa"&gt;{{cite web |title=Ghazni Minarets |url=https://www.wmf.org/project/ghazni-minarets |website=wmf.org |publisher=World Monuments Fund |accessdate=19 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LaterGhaznavidsBook"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The 12th century minarets are the most famous monuments of Ghazni city and are among the last surviving remnants of the great [[Ghaznavid Empire]]. The two minarets are called, '''Mas'ud III Minaret''' and '''Bahram Shah Minaret''' after the ruler who built them, Masud III (A.D. 1099-1115) and [[Bahram-Shah of Ghazna|Bahram Shah]] (A.D. 1118-1157).&lt;ref name="ab"&gt;{{cite web |title=072. Ghazni: Bahram Shah Minaret |url=https://www.cemml.colostate.edu/cultural/09476/afgh05-072.html |website=cemml.colostate.edu |accessdate=19 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The excavated palace of Mas'ud III lies nearby to the towers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Atkinson1839.jpg|left|thumb|A 1839 painting shows the cylindrical upper sections of the minarets before their destruction in 1902 earthquake.]]
The minarets were taller before the upper sections were damaged and destroyed over time. Part of the Masud III minaret top was destroyed in an earthquake in 1902.&lt;ref name="aa"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LaterGhaznavidsBook"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Threats==
Ghazni Minarets are not well preserved or protected. Both towers are in danger from natural elements and the political instability in Afghanistan. There is no basic security measures in place to prevent vandalism and the towers are in need of new roofing to prevent water infiltration into the towers.&lt;ref name="aa"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  

The towers surface intricate geometric patterns and [[Quran|Quranic]] inscriptions are deteriorating rapidly with exposure to rain and snow. They are further affected by the nearby road and the area is subject to periodic flooding.&lt;ref name="aa"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5694">'''Helen Gregory''' (born 1946) is a prominent [[historian]], [[author]] and retired [[public servant]] in and of [[Brisbane]], [[Queensland]] [[Australia]] and its surrounds.

She holds a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] (Hons) from the [[University of Queensland]] and is a former [[adjunct professor]] of that institution.

In 1969 Helen Gregory was the first Queensland woman to be offered a [[Rotary International|Rotary]] Overseas Postgraduate Scholarship, but was unable to take up the award.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uq.edu.au/news/?article=1098&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid 1970s she was a consultant historian to the private and government sectors, and is believed to be the first graduate historian in Queensland to use her training in this way, demonstrating that privately commissioned histories could be undertaken without sacrificing academic standards or ethical integrity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uq.edu.au/news/?article=1098&lt;/ref&gt; She was the founder of the [[Brisbane History Group]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brisbanehistory.asn.au/&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Professional Historians' Association (Queensland)]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.qld.historians.org.au/&lt;/ref&gt; the professional association which promotes the interests of consulting historians in Queensland, and maintains standards of practice. As well as commissioned history, Ms Gregory is the author or co-author of many academic articles and studies and several entries in the [[Australian Dictionary of Biography]].&lt;ref&gt;http://adb.anu.edu.au/biographies/author/?author=1542&amp;order=namec&lt;/ref&gt;

Ms Gregory became the first Chair of the [[Queensland Heritage Council]] in 1992, and subsequently became Director, Cultural Heritage in the [[Queensland Government]]'s Environment and Heritage department (later renamed the [[Environmental Protection Agency (Queensland)|Environmental Protection Agency]], the first woman to be appointed to a senior executive position in that department.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uq.edu.au/news/?article=1098&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 and subsequent years, Ms Gregory has been a judge of the History Book Award for the [[Queensland Premier's Literary Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.premiers.qld.gov.au/awardsevents/awards/literary/2005_Judges&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2006 Ms Gregory was a member of the independent panel that suggested the name for the [[Eleanor Schonell Bridge, Brisbane|Eleanor Schonell Bridge]] to the [[Lord Mayor of Brisbane]] and in November 2007 she was appointed to the board of trustees of [[Newstead House, Brisbane|Newstead House]], one of Queensland's oldest and most important cultural heritage sites.&lt;ref&gt;http://governmentbodies.premiers.qld.gov.au/the-board.aspx?bid=300&lt;/ref&gt;

Ms Gregory is married to prominent Brisbane solicitor Scott Gregory. Together they have three adult sons and, as of 2015, six grandchildren.

The '''''Historical Thesaurus of the Oxford English Dictionary''''' ('''''HTOED''''') is the print edition of the largest [[thesaurus]] in the world, the '''''Historical Thesaurus of English''''' ('''''HTE'''''), conceived and compiled by the English Language Department of the [[University of Glasgow]]. The ''HTE'' is a complete database of all the words in the second edition of [[Oxford English Dictionary|''The Oxford English Dictionary'']], arranged by [[semantic field]] and date. In this way, the ''HTE'' arranges the whole vocabulary of [[English language|English]], from the earliest written records in [[Old English language|Old English]] to the present, alongside types and dates of use. It is the first historical thesaurus to be compiled for any of the world's languages and contains 800,000 meanings for 600,000 words, within 230,000 categories, covering more than 920,000 words and meanings.&lt;ref name="Woolcock"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article6644646.ece | location=London | work=The Times | first=Nicola | last=Woolcock | title=After a 44-year labour of love worlds biggest thesaurus is born | date=2009-07-06}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hitchings|first1=Henry|authorlink1=Henry Hitchings|title=Historical Thesaurus is a masterpiece worth waiting 40 years for|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/6413166/Historical-Thesaurus-is-a-masterpiece-worth-waiting-40-years-for.html|accessdate=25 October 2014|publisher=The Telegraph|date=23 October 2009|ref=Hitchings-2009|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the ''HTE'' website states, "in addition to providing hitherto unavailable information for linguistic and textual scholars, the ''Historical Thesaurus'' online is a rich resource for students of social and cultural history, showing how concepts developed through the words that refer to them."&lt;ref name="hte"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://historicalthesaurus.arts.gla.ac.uk/ |title=Home page |website=The Historical Thesaurus of English |publisher=University of Glasgow |accessdate=2014-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ambitious project was announced at a 1965 meeting of the [[Philological Society]] by its originator, [[Michael Samuels (academic)|Michael Samuels]].&lt;ref name=Crystal-2014&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crystal|first1=David|authorlink1=David Crystal|title=Words in Time and Place: Exploring Language Through the ''Historical Thesaurus of the Oxford English Dictionary''|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0199680477|page=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Work on the ''HTE'' started in 1965.

On 22 October 2009, after 44 years of work, version 1.0 was published as a two-volume set as ''HTOED''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/oxfordshire/8136122.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; England &amp;#124; Oxfordshire &amp;#124; Forty-year wait for new thesaurus |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-07-06 |accessdate=2010-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of two slipcased hardcover volumes, totaling nearly 4,000 pages. The ''HTE'', released as version 4.2 in September 2014, is freely available online from the University of Glasgow.&lt;ref name="hte-versions"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://historicalthesaurus.arts.gla.ac.uk/versions-and-changes/ |title=Versions of the Thesaurus |website=The Historical Thesaurus of English |publisher=University of Glasgow |accessdate=2014-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main sections==
The work is divided into three main sections: the External World, the Mind, and Society. These are broken down into successively narrower domains. The text eventually discriminates more than 236,000 categories.

'''James Semple Kerr''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS|AM}} (6 July 1932 – 15 October 2014) was an [[architectural historian]] and heritage practitioner in Australia, who was prominent in the drafting of the original [[Burra Charter]] and its subsidiary documents, and developing standards for conservation practice, particularly in relation to conservation assessments and management reports such as conservation management plans. Kerr's influence in the conservation movement is most notable for his publication of the ''[[Conservation Plan]]'', which has guided building conservation in Australia and around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://australia.icomos.org/publications/the-conservation-plan/ Australia ICOMOS &gt; Publications &gt; The Conservation Plan]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work and contributions==

Kerr undertook a doctorate at the Institute of Advanced Architectural Studies, at the [[University of York]] in 1974. In 1978 he took up the position as Assistant Director at the [[Australian Heritage Commission]] in Canberra.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arthistoriography.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/steggall-rev.pdf Tradition and its transformation: Joan Kerr, housewife to historian, Susan Steggall]&lt;/ref&gt; He was also an assistant director of the National Trust of Australia (NSW).&lt;ref&gt;[http://australia.icomos.org/wp-content/uploads/The-Conservation-Plan-7th-Edition-reduced-file-size.pdf Conservation Plan online edition, Australia ICOMOS &gt; Publications, 2013, author details p.83]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kerr was prominent in heritage conservation in Australia for over 40 years and was an early member of [[Australia ICOMOS]], taking a major role in the formulation of the [[Burra Charter]] and its Guidelines. His publication in 1982 of ''The Conservation Plan: A guide to the preparation of conservation plans for places of European cultural significance'' was a landmark in Australian conservation. ''The Conservation Plan'' is widely used by heritage practitioners and property owners in Australia, and worldwide as a primary guide to the process of researching, documenting and managing historic places in accordance with the [[Burra Charter]], through a logical process. First published by the [[National Trust of Australia]] (NSW) in 1982, it has subsequently been reprinted in expanded form over seven editions and twelve printing impressions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Kerr, James Semple | author2=Hanna, Bronwyn J. (Interviewer) | title=James Semple Kerr interviewed by Bronwyn Hanna in the Burra Charter oral history project | publication-date=2011 | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/160040650 | accessdate=25 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has been adopted worldwide as a critical process for conserving heritage places, for example in the British [[Heritage Lottery Fund]] guidance note ''Conservation Plans for Historic Places''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buildingconservation.com/articles/consplans/conserve.htm 'Conservation Plans, Benefit or burden?' reproduced from The Building Conservation Directory, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|
For Kerr, "the seven deadly sins of heritage assessment were: the Timorous; the Inarticulate; the Aesthetes and Moralists; the Indiscriminate; the Egotists; the Slothful and the Muddled".&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clark|first1=Kate|title=Obituary: Jim Kerr's heritage legacy forms guard of honour|url=http://www.smh.com.au/comment/obituaries/obituary-jim-kerrs-heritage-legacy-forms-guard-of-honour-20141121-11r4nu.html|accessdate=22 November 2014|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|issue=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Life and family==

Kerr was born on 6 July 1932 in Rockhampton, Queensland, son of grazier James Kerr and Iris (née Rudd), and he and his sisters were raised on Hampden Downs Station. Initially home schooled by his mother, he later attended Toowoomba Preparatory School and then King's School Parramatta. He joined the [[Royal Australian Naval Volunteer Reserve]] in 1952, leaving in 1956. He became an accomplished oarsman in Queensland and later NSW state competitions, but missed out narrowly on selection for the 1956 Olympics.&lt;ref name=Clark/&gt;

Kerr married [[Joan Kerr|Joan Lyndon]] (1938–2004), an art and architectural historian, whom he had met in 1957. They wed on 30 November 1960 at [[All Saints Anglican Church, Brisbane]], moving to Sydney soon after. Kerr was working in management at [[Qantas]] at the time. In 1963, Qantas posted Kerr to Geneva,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daao.org.au/bio/joan-kerr-2/biography/ Design &amp; Art Australia Online, 'Professor Joan Kerr' Biography]&lt;/ref&gt; and then to London, where Joan enrolled them both in a history of art course run by [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] at [[Birkbeck College]]. They returned to Australia in 1968, settling in [[Cremorne, New South Wales|Cremorne]] in Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/03/03/1078295446185.html?from=storyrhs 'Sparkling mind lit up the art world' Obituary Professor Joan Kerr, ''Sydney Morning Herald'' 4 March 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; They had two children, a daughter, Tamsin and a son, James.

Kerr's wife Joan died in 2004, and James published "Joan Kerr, A Pictorial Biography, 1938–2004" in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Kerr, James Semple | author2=Torrance, Joan, 1867–1943 | title=Joan Kerr : a pictorial biography, 1938–2004 | publication-date=2006 | publisher=Cremorne, N.S.W. J.S. Kerr | isbn=978-0-9775454-0-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also published letters from his son (also James Semple), who worked as an [[outback]] [[Stockman (Australia)|stockman]].&lt;ref&gt;Stockman's Progress: 1982–1989: Letters of James Semple Kerr (born 1963), to His Parents from the Northern Territory and The Kimberleys, James Semple Kerr, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Kerr died on Wednesday 15 October 2014 at Elizabeth Lodge nursing home, [[Willoughby, New South Wales]]. His final project had been to catalogue the works of his wife and of his own.&lt;ref name=Clark/&gt; His personal papers, along with those of his wife, and records of his family history have been deposited, in bound volumes, in the [[National Library of Australia]] in Canberra.&lt;ref&gt;[http://australia.icomos.org/e-news/australia-icomos-e-mail-news-no-654/#1. Australia ICOMOS E-Mail News No. 654 17 October 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==

Kerr was made Honorary Life Member of the National Trust (NSW) in 1992 and was awarded the NSW National Trust Heritage Award with his wife Joan in 1995, and they received the lifetime achievement award in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationaltrust.org.au/Assets/16074/1/TrustHeritageawardpastwinners.pdf  Professor Joan and Dr James Kerr for their outstanding contribution to heritage over many years Sydney Electricity National Trust Sponsor's Award]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and he was made an Honorary Life Member of Australia ICOMOS in 2003 and International Honorary Life Member in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://australia.icomos.org/about-us/australia-icomos/honours-and-awards/ Australia ICOMOS &gt; About Us &gt; Australia ICOMOS &gt; Honours And Awards]&lt;/ref&gt; He was also made a [[Member of the Order of Australia]] in 1999, "...for service to heritage conservation through organisations including the Australian International Council on Monuments And Sites, and The New South Wales Branch of the National Trust of Australia".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=878243&amp;search_type=simple&amp;showInd=true Australian Honours Secretariat, Database]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Johann Georg v. Eckhart.jpeg|thumb|250px|Johann Georg von Eckhart]]
'''Johann Georg von Eckhart''' (7 September 1664 – 9 February 1730) was a German historian and linguist.

==Biography==
Eckhart was born at [[Duingen]] in the [[Principality of Calenberg]]. After preparatory training at [[Schulpforta]], he went to [[Leipzig]], where at first, at the desire of his mother, he studied [[theology]], but soon turned his attention to [[philology]] and history. On completing his course he became secretary to [[Heino Heinrich Graf von Flemming|Field-Marshal Count Flemming]], chief minister to the [[Elector of Saxony]]; after a short time, however, he went to [[Hannover]] to find a permanent position.

Owing to his extensive learning he was soon useful to [[Gottfried Leibniz]], who in 1694 took Eckhart as assistant, and was, until death, his large-hearted patron and generous friend. Through the efforts of Leibniz, Eckhart was appointed professor of history at [[Helmstedt]] in 1706, and in 1714 councillor at Hannover.

After the death of Leibniz he was made [[librarian]] and [[historiographer]] to the [[House of Hanover]], and was soon after ennobled by [[Emperor Charles VI]], to whom he had dedicated his work ''Origines Austriacae'' (Lipsia 1721 {{OCLC|166010541}}). For reasons which have never been clearly explained he gave up his position, in 1723, and fled from Hanover, perhaps on account of debt, to the [[Benedictine]] [[monastery]] at [[Corvey]], and thence to the [[Jesuit]]s at [[Cologne]], where he became a [[Catholic]].

Not long after this, [[Johann Philipp von Schönborn]], [[Bishop of Würzburg]] appointed Eckhart his librarian and historiographer. In his work Eckhart was influenced by the new school of French historians, and gave careful attention to the so-called auxiliary sciences, above all to [[diplomatics]]; he also strove earnestly to follow a strictly scientific method in his treatment of historical materials. Together with Leibniz he is considered a founder of modern [[historiography]] in Germany.

Besides the help he rendered Leibniz, of whom he edited the ''Collectanea Etymologica'' (1717) and prepared an affectionately respectful obituary (in [[Christoph Gottlieb von Murr]], ''Journal für Kunstgeschichte'', VII), he issued a number of independent works. His chief work, while professor at Helmsted, is his ''Historia studii etymologici linguae germanicae haetenus impensi'' Hanover, 1711), a literary and historical study of all works bearing on the investigation of the [[Germanic languages]]. At Hanover he compiled a ''Corpus historicum medii aevi'' (Leipzig, 1723), in two volumes; at Würzburg he published the ''Commentarii de rebus Franciae Orientalis et episcopatus Wirceburgensis'' (1729), also in two volumes.

In 1725, Eckhart, along with [[Ignatz Roderick]], hoaxed their fellow academic [[Johann Beringer]], at the University of Würzburg, in the "[[Beringer's Lying Stones|Lying Stones]]" affair.

Eckhart died 1730 at [[Würzburg]] at 66.

==Life==

He was born at [[Augsburg]]. He was destined for the [[Lutheran]] Church, and graduated at the [[University of Jena]] in 1718. He returned to Augsburg in 1720, but became parish minister of [[Kaufbeuren]] in 1723.
 
In 1731 he was elected a member of the Academy of Sciences at Berlin, and was invited to return again to Augsburg as pastor and senior minister of the Church of St. Ulrich.

He died at Augsburg.

His chief work, ''Historia Critica Philosophiae'' ("Critical History of Philosophy"), appeared at [[Leipzig]] (originally 5 vols., 1742–1744). Its success was such that a new edition was published in six volumes (1766–1767; English translation by [[William Enfield]], 1791). It is by this work alone that Brucker is now known. It was the modern era's first complete history of the different philosophical schools. It embodies an ample collection of materials, and contains valuable biographies. [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] in his advice to read the original writings of philosophers, praised Brucker. He wrote that "Their real study demands all of a long and studious life, such as the stout-hearted Brucker formerly devoted to them in the industrious times of old (''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', Volume 1, "Fragments for the History of Philosophy," § 1)."

He also wrote ''Tentamen Introductionis in Historiam Doctrinae de Ideis'', afterwards completed and republished under the title of ''Historia Philosophicae Doctrinae de Ideis'' (Augsburg, 1723); ''Otium Vindelicum'' (1731); ''Kurze Fragen aus der philosophischen Historiae'' (7 vols., Ulm, 1731–1736), a [[history of philosophy]] in question and answer, containing many details, especially in the department of [[History of literature|literary history]], which he omitted in his chief work; ''Pinacotheca Scriptorum nostra aetate literis illustrium'', etc. (Augsburg, 1741–1755); ''Ehrentempel der deutschen Gelehrsamkeit'' (Augsburg, 1747–1749); ''Institutiones Historiae Philosophicae'' (Leipzig, 1747 and 1756; 3rd ed. with a continuation by F. G. B. Born (1743–1807) of Leipzig, in 1790); ''Miscellanea Historiae Philosophicae Literariae Criticae olim sparsim edita'' (Augsburg, 1748); ''Erste Anfangsgründe der philosophischen Geschichte'' (Ulm, 1751). He superintended an edition of [[Martin Luther]]'s translation of the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]], with a commentary extracted from the writings of the English theologians (Leipzig, 1758–1770, completed by V. A. Teller).

'''Joseph Taylor''' (died 1652) was a 17th-century English actor. As the successor of [[Richard Burbage]] as the leading actor with the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]], he was arguably the most important actor in the later [[Literature in English#Jacobean literature|Jacobean]] and the [[Literature in English#Caroline and Cromwellian literature|Caroline]] eras.&lt;ref&gt;[[F. E. Halliday]], ''A Shakespeare Companion 1564–1964,'' Baltimore, Penguin, 1964; p. 486.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
Taylor started as a child actor with the [[Children of the Chapel]] in the first decade of the century. As he matured he remained in the profession, with the [[Lady Elizabeth's Men]] and [[Prince Charles's Men]]. With those companies, he developed into an important leading man.

==King's men==
Richard Burbage died in March 1619; Taylor joined the King's Men the next month, and over the coming years he acted all the major roles of the Shakespearean canon. According to James Wright's ''[[Historia Histrionica]]'' (1699), Taylor "acted Hamlet incomparably well" and was noted for his [[Iago]]. He was also famous for the parts of Paris in ''[[The Roman Actor]]'' ([[Philip Massinger]]), Ferdinand in ''[[The Duchess of Malfi]]'' ([[John Webster]]), and Mosca in ''[[Volpone]],'' Face in ''[[The Alchemist (play)|The Alchemist]],'' and Truewit in ''[[Epicoene, or the Silent Woman|Epicene]]'' (all by [[Ben Jonson]]). Taylor starred in many King's men plays; he played the protagonists in Massinger's ''[[The Picture (Massinger play)|The Picture]]'' and [[Arthur Wilson (17th century)|Arthur Wilson's]] ''[[The Swisser]]''; he was the Duke in [[Lodowick Carlell]]'s ''[[The Deserving Favourite]]''.

===Leadership===
Taylor and [[John Lowin]] became leaders of the King's Men after the deaths of [[Henry Condell]] (1627) and [[John Heminges]] (1630). At the same time (1630), Taylor gained a share in the [[Blackfriars Theatre]], and two shares in the [[Globe Theatre|Globe]]. Together with [[Cuthbert Burbage]], [[Richard Robinson (actor)|Richard Robinson]] and Winifred (d.1642), his wife, [[William Heminges]], and [[John Lowin]], Taylor filed a Bill of Complaint on 28 January 1632 in the [[Court of Requests]] against the owner of the Globe, [[Matthew Brend|Sir Matthew Brend]], in order to obtain confirmation of an extension of the 31-year lease originally granted by Sir Matthew Brend's father, [[Nicholas Brend]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Berry|1987|p=197}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was one of the King's Men who signed the dedication of the [[Beaumont and Fletcher folios|first Beaumont and Fletcher folio]] of [[1647 in literature|1647]].

===Commonwealth period===
Taylor and other King's Men struggled during the [[English Commonwealth|Commonwealth]] period when the theatres were officially closed; they performed when and where they could. On 1 January 1649, Taylor, Lowin, and other company members were arrested while acting ''[[Rollo Duke of Normandy]]'' at the [[Cockpit Theatre]]. (Taylor played the title role.) They were incarcerated for a short time, then released.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Milhous and Robert D. Hume, "New Light on English Acting Companies in 1646, 1648, and 1660," ''Review of English Studies'' Vol. 42 No. 168 (November 1991), pp. 487-509.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1652 in literature|1652]] a special publication of [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher's]] ''[[The Wild Goose Chase]]'' was issued; the proceeds went to Lowin and Taylor to relieve their financial need. Taylor and Lowin had played the roles of Belleur and Mirabel in the King's Men's production of the play. ''The Wild Goose Chase'' had been lost and was left out of the first Beaumont and Fletcher folio, then rediscovered and published.

The date of Taylor's death is not known with certainty, though he was buried on 4 November 1652.

==Cast lists==
In the 25 cast lists that were added to the second Beaumont and Fletcher folio of [[1679 in literature|1679]], Taylor is mentioned in 18, for the following plays:

{{col-begin}}
{{col-2}}
* ''[[The Coxcomb]]''
* ''[[The Custom of the Country (1647 play)|The Custom of the Country]]''
* ''[[The Double Marriage]]''
* ''[[The False One]]''
* ''[[The Honest Man's Fortune]]''
* ''[[The Humorous Lieutenant]]''
* ''[[The Island Princess]]''
* ''[[The Laws of Candy]]''
* ''[[The Little French Lawyer]]''
{{col-2}}
* ''[[The Lovers' Progress]]''
* ''[[The Maid in the Mill]]''
* ''[[The Pilgrim (play)|The Pilgrim]]''
* ''[[The Prophetess (play)|The Prophetess]]''
* ''[[The Sea Voyage]]''
* ''[[The Spanish Curate]]''
* ''[[The Wild Goose Chase]]''
* ''[[A Wife for a Month]]''
* ''[[Women Pleased]]''
{{col-end}}

His total is second only to Lowin's 21. The lists for ''The Coxcomb'' and ''The Humorous Lieutenant'' refer to the companies to which Taylor belonged early in his career; the other 16 refer to the King's Men. On 11 of the lists, Taylor is mentioned first, an index of his standing as the company's leading player. (For comparison, Burbage is on seven of the lists, and always in first place.)

'''Krisztián Ungváry''' (born 30 October 1969) is a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] historian of 20th century political and military history. He wrote about the [[Battle of Budapest|siege of Budapest]] in [[World War II]] and researched the work of the secret service under the communist period of Hungary.

Ungváry is the son of Rudolf Ungváry, a high-ranking employee of the [[National Széchényi Library|Országos Széchényi Könyvtár]], and journalist Éva Monspart. He concluded his high school studies in the II. Rákoczi Ferenc Gimnázium in [[Budapest]] between 1984 and 1988. In 1989 he continued his studies on the Eötvös Loránd Tudományegyetem university, specializing in German and History. During his studies, he was a holder of several scholarships, including that of the Republican Scholarship of Hungary. In 1993 he studied in Germany, and finally graduated in 1995 with Grade A results.

On 15 October 1988, he was amongst the founding members of the Hungarian Boyscout Association.

He published his most well-known work, ''Budapest ostroma'' (The Siege of Budapest), based on his doctoral dissertation. The book, probably the most through and balanced account of the [[Battle of Budapest|siege of Budapest]] written, was highly successful in Hungary and brought Ungváry widespread acknowledgement as a historian. The work was to see six Hungarian, four German, two British and two American edition.

His area of interest remains 20th century political and military history. In his private life, he is an owner of his private vineyard and producer of wine.

'''Kwäday Dän Ts'ìnchi''' ({{IPA-all|kuday dancin chi|pron}}){{Needs IPA}} (meaning ''Long Ago Person Found'' in [[Southern Tutchone]]), or '''Canadian Ice Man''', is a naturally [[mummy|mummified]] body found in [[Tatshenshini-Alsek Park]] in [[British Columbia]], Canada, by a group of hunters in 1999. [[Radiocarbon dating]] of artifacts found with the body placed the age of the body at between 300 and 550 years.  The find was comparable in condition and scientific value to [[Ötzi the Iceman]], remains dating to 3300&amp;nbsp;BC that were found in the [[Ötztal Alps]] in 1991.&lt;ref name=background&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tsa.gov.bc.ca/archaeology/kwaday_d%C3%A4n_ts%E2%80%99inchi/project_introduction.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501070339/http://www.tsa.gov.bc.ca/archaeology/kwaday_d%C3%A4n_ts%E2%80%99inchi/project_introduction.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-05-01 |title=Kwaday Dän Ts'inchi Project Introduction |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=relatives&gt;{{cite news|title=Scientists find 17 living relatives of 'iceman' discovered in B.C. glacier |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/british-columbia/story/2008/04/25/ice-man.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080427061841/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/british-columbia/story/2008/04/25/ice-man.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 27, 2008 |date=April 25, 2008 |publisher=CBC News |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[DNA testing]] of more than 240 volunteers from the local [[Champagne and Aishihik First Nations]] revealed 17 persons who are related to the ice man through their direct maternal line. They were excited to have their deep connections to the area affirmed.

==Discovery==
Three sheep hunters, Bill Hanlon, Warren Ward and Mike Roch, discovered a number of artifacts and a human body in a melting [[glacier]] while hunting near the [[Yukon]] border on July 22, 1999 ({{coord|60|N|138|W}}).  The hunters were walking along a glacier, above the tree line, and noticed some bits of wood, which they thought unusual given their location. They examined the wood, and noticed carvings and notches, possibly indicating the wood formed the frame of a [[backpack]].  Searching with [[binoculars]], Ward discovered the body in the ice. On August 16, the party reported their find to Beringia Centre staff, and turned in a number of artifacts they collected from the site.

Before making a public announcement, the Centre notified representatives of the [[Champagne and Aishihik First Nations]], whose historic territory is here.&lt;ref name=brooke/&gt; They visited the site and decided to name the person Kwäday Dän Ts'ìnchi, which means ''Long Ago Person Found.'' A team of archeologists was assembled to assess the find, and the First Nations were further consulted about the project.&lt;ref name=chronology&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tsa.gov.bc.ca/archaeology/kwaday_d%C3%A4n_ts%E2%80%99inchi/chronology.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430202918/http://www.tsa.gov.bc.ca/archaeology/kwaday_d%C3%A4n_ts%E2%80%99inchi/chronology.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-04-30 |title=Kwaday Dän Ts'inchi Project Chronology |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gengen&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thegeneticgenealogist.com/2008/04/27/kwday-dn-tsnchi-long-ago-person-found/ |author=Blaine Bettinger |title=Kwäday Dän Ts’ìnchi - "Long-Ago Person Found" |work=The Genetic Genealogist blog |date=27 April 2008| accessdate=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They supported having scientific studies done, including DNA analysis.&lt;ref name=brooke&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The New York Times |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B02E0D81F38F936A1575BC0A96F958260 |title=Body of Ancient Man Found in West Canada Glacier |author=JAMES BROOKE |date=25 August 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The remains had been dismembered after death, probably by shifting ice due to thermal cracking and slumping along the edge of the glacier. The first part found was the torso, with left arm and mummified hand still attached. The lower body was found a few meters away, with the thighs and muscle still attached. The head was missing, as were the right arm and lower right leg, though his hair, attached to some remnants of the scalp, and some small bones from the right hand and foot were recovered. Soft tissue was present primarily in the torso and thighs. The torso was of particular interest, as gastric contents could be analyzed to yield clues to the days leading up to the man's death.&lt;ref name=gengen /&gt;&lt;ref name=beattie&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.kdtsymposium.bc.ca/Content_Files/Files/kdts/beattie_et_al_ocr_small.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327120336/http://www.kdtsymposium.bc.ca/Content_Files/Files/kdts/beattie_et_al_ocr_small.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-03-27 |journal=Canadian Journal of Archaeology |issue=24 |year=2000 |pages=129–147 |title=The Kwäday Dän Ts’ìnchi Discovery from a Glacier in British Columbia |author1=Owen Beattie |author2=Brian Apland |author3=Erik W.

Kwäday Dän Ts’ìnchi represents the oldest well-preserved human remains in North America. The young man was estimated to be approximately 18–19 years old at his time of death.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pringle, Heather]]. "The Messenger", ''Canadian Geographic Magazine'', Dec 2008, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; The cause of death is unknown, but there appears to be no sign of serious injury, and [[hypothermia]] is a possibility. He died near the onset of the [[Little Ice Age]]. An examination of the food in Kwäday Dän Ts’ìnchi's digestive tract reveals that he had traveled a distance of around {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} in the three days prior to his death, from the coastal region up into higher elevations where he was found.  Based on [[pollen]] found in the contents of his [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]], he was traveling in the summer.&lt;ref name=sikikavich&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.taiga.net/rapidchange/star_jun17.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061003070525/http://www.taiga.net/rapidchange/star_jun17.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 3, 2006 |title=Delegates hear of ice man's final journey |author=Julia Skikavich |journal=Whitehorse Star |date=June 17, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kwäday Dän Ts’ìnchi was found with a number of artifacts, including a robe made from 95 pelts of the local [[arctic ground squirrel]] (commonly called "gophers") subspecies ''Spermophilus parryii plesius''&lt;ref name="Teachings"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hebda |first1=Richard J. |last2=Greer |first2=Sheila |last3=Mackie |first3=Alexander P. |title=Teachings From Long Ago Person Found: Highlights from the Kwädąy Dän Ts’ìnchį Project |url=https://issuu.com/royalbcmuseum/docs/kdt_highlights |website=Issuu |publisher=Royal BC Museum |accessdate=7 July 2018 |date=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; sewn together with sinew, a woven Tlingit ''zauk-kaht'' (root hat) of split spruce root (probably [[Sitka spruce]])&lt;ref name="Teachings"/&gt;, a pouch or small bag of [[beaver]] fur containing a mass of lichen, mosses and leaves&lt;ref name="Teachings"/&gt;, [[Fishing gaff|gaff poles]]/walking sticks&lt;ref name="Teachings"/&gt;, sticks for carrying salmon&lt;ref name="Teachings"/&gt;, a curved, hooked stick possibly used for setting snares to catch marmots&lt;ref name="Teachings"/&gt;, a "Carved and Painted stick" of unknown purpose, an iron-bladed [[knife]] with matching gopher skin sheath&lt;ref name="Teachings"/&gt;, and an [[atlatl]] and dart. The use of gopher skins for common household items, robes, and blankets had been important in the past, but the discovery of Kwäday Dän Ts’ìnchi helped revive interest among the Champagne and Aishihik people in teaching and passing on the skills involved, from harvesting the animals to the preparation and the sewing of pelts together.&lt;ref name=cafn&gt;[http://cafn.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Kwaday_Dan_Tsinchi_Newsletter_March_2009.pdf ''Kwäday Dän Ts’ìnchi Newsletter''].

Tissue studies revealed that his long-term diet consisted principally of shellfish and salmon, indicating that he was originally from one of the communities near the [[Pacific Ocean]] coast; however, hair samples indicated that his diet over the couple of months before his death had been more strongly meat-based than usual, suggesting that he had spent some time inland.&lt;ref name=cafn/&gt; His stomach contents included [[beach asparagus]] and he was carrying salmon and shellfish with him, suggesting that he had been back at the coast again and was travelling back inland to the [[Tatshenshini River]] at the time of his death.&lt;ref name=cafn/&gt;

The tribes allowed samples to be taken for study, including DNA for study. They decided to have his remains [[cremation|cremated]] and scattered over the area where he was discovered. Local clans are considering a memorial [[potlatch]] to honor the ancient man.&lt;ref name=background /&gt;&lt;ref name=relatives /&gt;&lt;ref name=beattie /&gt;&lt;ref name=photos&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tsa.gov.bc.ca/archaeology/kwaday_d%C3%A4n_ts%E2%80%99inchi/pages/7.9.3_index.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501070334/http://www.tsa.gov.bc.ca/archaeology/kwaday_d%C3%A4n_ts%E2%80%99inchi/pages/7.9.3_index.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-05-01 |title=Kwaday Dän Ts'inchi Project Photos |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==DNA tests==
In 2000, [[Mitochondrion|mitochondrial]] [[DNA]] tests of 241 area volunteers of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations revealed 17 living persons who are related to Kwäday Dän Ts’ìnchi through their direct maternal line.&lt;ref&gt;Pringle, Heather. "The Messenger", ''Canadian Geographic Magazine'', Dec 2008, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; Among them were Sheila Clark and Pearl Callaghan, two of seven sisters. Clark said of finding they were related to Long Ago Man, "It was extremely moving. I couldn't believe it." Fifteen of the 17 individuals identify as Wolf [[clan]], suggesting the man may also have belonged to the Wolf clan. In their [[matrilineal]] kinship system, children are considered born into their mother's clan. The individuals were split roughly in half between those who lived in coastal areas and those who lived inland, reflecting historic territories of bands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/2007515/posts Judith Lavoie, Canwest News Service, "Iceman's DNA Linked To Coastal Aboriginals (Canada)"], ''Leader Post'', 26 April 2008, accessed 5 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

A partial [[mitochondrial DNA]] sequence of Kwäday Dän Ts’ìnchi, containing information on the [[hypervariable region]] HVR2, bases 1 to 360, is available in the [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]]'s [[genome sequencing]] database, [[GenBank]], as accession number AF502945.&lt;ref name=relatives /&gt;&lt;ref name=mtDNA&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/viewer.fcgi?db=nuccore&amp;id=25992124 |title=Homo sapiens isolate Kwäday Dän Ts’ìnchi mitochondrial control region, partial sequence.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conference==
The find and studies generated great interest in Kwäday Dän Ts’ìnchi. In June 2005, the findings were discussed at a science conference on ''Rapid Landscape Change'' at [[Yukon College]].&lt;ref name=sikikavich/&gt;

The '''''Leyes de Burgos''''' ("'''Laws of Burgos'''"), promulgated on 27 December 1512 in [[Burgos]], [[Crown of Castile]] (Spain), was the first codified set of laws governing the behavior of [[Spaniards]] in the Americas, particularly with regard to the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous people of the Americas]] ''('native Caribbean Indians')''. They forbade the maltreatment of the indigenous people and endorsed their [[proselytize|conversion]] to Catholicism.  The laws were created following the conquest and [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] in the [[West Indies]], where the [[common law]] of Castile was not fully applicable.

The scope of the laws was originally restricted to the island of [[Hispaniola]] but was later extended to [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Jamaica]]. These laws authorized and legalized the colonial practice of creating ''[[Encomienda]]s'', where Indians were grouped together to work under a colonial head of the estate for a salary, and limited the size of these establishments to between 40 and 150 people. They also established a minutely regulated regime of work, pay, provisioning, living quarters, [[hygiene]], and care for the Indians in a reasonably protective and humanitarian spirit.  Women more than four months pregnant were exempted from work.

The document also prohibited the use of any form of punishment by the ''encomenderos'', reserving it for officials established in each town for the implementation of the laws.  It also ordered that the Indians be [[Catechism|catechized]], outlawed [[bigamy]], and required that the huts and cabins of the Indians be built together with those of the Spanish.  It respected, in some ways, the traditional authorities, granting chiefs exemptions from ordinary jobs and granting them various Indians as servants.

The limited fulfillment of the laws sometimes led to protests and claims. Sometimes they were seen as a legalization of the previously poorer situation, which created momentum for reform, later carried out through the ''[[Leyes Nuevas]]'' ("New Laws") in 1542, a new set of stricter regulations about life in the New World including the rights of indigenous peoples, as well as the [[Laws of the Indies]], to encompass the [[Papal bull]] and all edicts.

== Origins ==

[[cardinal (catholicism)|Cardinal Archbishop]] Domingo de Mendoza of [[Seville]], heard reports of the abuse of the Americas' Indians and sent a group of [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] missionaries to [[Hispaniola]] to stop the maltreatment. They could not legally stop it, but missionaries made complaints and stirred up a debate that the settlers feared would make them lose their property interests; Fray [[Antonio de Montesinos (Dominican friar)|Antonio de Montesinos]] preached to the colonists that they were sinning and did not have the right to force the Indians to serve them, claiming they should only be converted to Christianity.

The colonists disagreed and decided the best way to protect their interests was to come together as a group and choose a [[Franciscan]] Friar named [[Alonso de Espinal]] to present their case to King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and refute Montesinos's accusations. The colonists' plan backfired, though, and the Spanish King was outraged by the cases of maltreatment of the Indians. To solve the moral and legal question, he commissioned a group of theologians and academics to come up with a solution.

[[Dominican Order|Dominican Friars]], under the sponsorship of [[Diego de Deza]], supported the scientific examination of [[Christopher Columbus]]'s claims for exploring the West that he presented to the ruling [[Queen of Castile]], [[Isabel I of Castile]] and her husband, [[King of Aragon]] [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]]. After 1508, the friars made the case to defend the aboriginal [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]] from becoming [[serfs]] or [[slaves]] of the new colonists.

The friars and other Spanish academics pressured King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and his daughter, ruling [[Queen of Castile]], [[Joanna I of Castile]], to pass a set of laws to protect the rights of the natives of the New World, which were to be the 1512 Laws of Burgos. In Burgos, on 27 December 1512, thirty-five laws were put into effect to secure the freedom of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]] and to enforce [[Indian Reductions]] governing conversions.

==Summary==

1: The Indians are to be moved to ''encomiendas''. For every fifty Indians, four lodges shall be built (thirty by fifteen feet). This land cannot be taken from them since they were taken from their original land. The Indians will do the planting of all of the food. During the proper seasons, the encomenderos (men looking over the Indians) will have the Indians plant corn and raise the hens.

2: The Indians will leave their land voluntarily to come to the ''encomiendas'' so that they shall not suffer from being removed by force.

3: The citizen to whom the Indians are given must erect a structure to be used as a church. In the church must be a picture of Our Lady and a bell with which to call the Indians to prayer time. The person who has them in the ''encomienda'' must go with them to church every night and make sure they cross themselves and sing several hymns. If an Indian does not come to the church, he is not allowed to rest the next day.

4: To make sure the Indians are learning Christianity properly, they shall be tested every two weeks and taught what they do not know by the Encomendero. He shall teach them the [[Ten Commandments]], the [[Seven Deadly Sins]], and the [[Creed|Articles of Faith]]. Any ''encomendero'' that does not do this properly will be fined six gold [[peso]]s.

5: A church will be built equidistant from all estates. On Sundays, Mass shall be observed and a feast will be eaten. If the ''encomendero'' does not bring his Indians, he will be charged ten gold pesos.

6: If The church is too far away, another will be built.

7: The priests who collect [[tithes]] from the estates must have priests continually in the churches of the estates.

8: There shall be churches built at the mines so that the Indians working the mines may hear mass on Sundays.

9: Whoever has fifty Indians must choose one boy who the ''encomendero'' thinks is able, to be taught to read and write, and also the importance of Catholicism. This boy will then teach the other Indians because the Indians would more readily accept what the boy says than what the Spaniards says. If the encomendero has one hundred Indians, two boys shall be chosen. The faith must be ingrained into their heads so the souls of the Indians are saved.

10: If an Indian falls sick near where there is a priest, the priest must go to him and recite the [[Credo]] and other profitable things of the Catholic faith. The Indian shall make confession without being charged a fee. If the Indian is to die, he shall be buried with a cross near the church. If he is not buried, the ''encomendero'' owes a fine of four gold pesos.

11: The Indians must not be used as carriers for transporting things to the Indians at the mines.

12: All Spanish inhabitants who have Indians in an ''encomienda'' must have the infants baptized within a week of their birth.

13: After the Indians have been brought to the estates, gold shall be searched for as follows: Indians in an ''encomienda'' must search for gold for five months a year and at the end of the five months are allowed to rest for forty days. During the forty days, the Indians are not to be employed, unless they are a slave and accept to plant the crops. During the forty days, the Indians will be further instructed in faith since they have more time to learn.

14: The Indians must be allowed to perform their sacred dances.

15: All citizens who have Indians are required to feed them breads, yams, peppers, and on Sundays feed them dishes of cooked meat. For every offense, a fine of two gold pesos shall be paid.

16: According to Catholicism, the Indians are not allowed to have more than one wife at a time and they are not allowed to abandon their wives.

17: Sons of the chiefs of the Islands who are under the age of thirteen are to be given to the Friars so they can be taught how to read, write, and other things about Catholicism. When the sons reach the age of nineteen, they are to return to the encomienda and teach the others.

18: Pregnant women are not to be sent to the mines or made to plant the crops. They shall be kept on the estate and made to do household duties such as cooking and weeding. After the child is born, she can nurse it until it is three years old. After this time, she can return to the mines and other duties.

19: The Indians should not sleep on the ground. Each ''encomendero'' should provide his Indians with hammocks.

20: The Indians are to be given one gold peso every year to pay for clothing.

21: Indians may not change their masters. One ''encomendero'' cannot employ or house an Indian belonging to another ''encomendero''.

22: The Indian chiefs are allowed two Indians to perform personal duties for every forty of their subjects. Also, visitors to the estates must treat the Indians well and teach them what they know of Catholicism.

23:  Official inspectors must keep records of the activities and also the treatment of the Indians in the ''encomiendas''. They must keep track of the population and how much gold is being mined.

24:  The Indians are not to be physically or verbally abused for any reason.

25: The Indians are not to be used in private trade or for any other economic interest.

26: ''Encomenderos'' that have their Indians working in distant mines shall combine efforts with other estates to help provide food for the Indians.

27 Indians from other lands must also be taught the things of the Catholic faith. They are to be treated kindly, unless they are slaves.

28:  If an ''encomendero'' dies, his successor takes control of the Indians.

29:  Two inspectors should be appointed to each Estate.

30. The inspectors are to be chosen by the Admiral, judges, and officers. These people should be compensated by being given Indians in encomienda.

31. Villages should be inspected two times a year, once in the beginning of the year, and once in the summer.

32:  If there is a runaway Indian, inspectors cannot apprehend them. They must be given to a man of good conscience who will find the Indians' ''encomendero''.

33: All inspectors should hold a copy of the Laws of Burgos, signed by the Governor.

34: Inspectors must be provided residencias.

35:  One person may not have more than one hundred and fifty Indians and no less than forty Indians in encomienda at one time.

Amendments were added to the Laws or Burgos on 28 July 1513.

1: Indian women married to Indian men are not to be forced to serve with their husbands at the mines or anywhere else unless it is by their own free will or unless their husbands wish to take them.

2: Indian children do not have to do the work of adults until the reach the age of fourteen. They are then made to do the tasks of children, like weeding or working in their parents estates.

3: Unmarried Indian women who are under the authority of their parents have to work with them on their lands. Those not under the authority of their parents must be kept apart so they don’t become vagabonds.

4: After two years of service, the Indians are free to go. By this time they will be civilized and proper Christians, able to govern themselves.

==Results==
[[Bartolomé de Las Casas]] believed that the New World was granted to Spain and Portugal solely for the conversion of the Native residents. The Indians, he believed, should not be used for other purposes, especially not for profit. The only solution was to remove the presence of the Spanish colonists from the Indians, except for practicing missionaries.

On 28 July 1513, four more laws were added in what is known today as [[Leyes Complementarias de Valladolid 1513]], three related to Indian women and Indian children and another more related to Indian males. They were operational till 17 November 1526, when the so-called [[Ordenanzas de Granada 1526]] came effective. These new amended laws reflected the theological and political disputes within the Spanish theologians and the intervention  of the Roman Catholic Popes advisers included .

They have been dealt with since the creation of the [[Council of the Indies]], March 1523, by king [[Charles I of Spain]], the son of Queen [[Joanna I of Castile]], "The Mad", whose first president was Dominican Friar and Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church since 1530 under pope [[Clement VII]] Medici, (1478–1534), a former  General of the [[Dominican Order]], 1518–1524,   [[Juan Garcia de Loaysa]] y Mendoza, (1478–1546), [[Archbishop of Sevilla]], 1539 – 1546.

The later "Ordenanzas de Granada," 1526, were discussed mainly between king [[Charles I of Spain]] and "Licenciado" [[Rodrigo de Figueroa]] as a consequence of the extensive Institutional Battling promoted by famous Dominican Father [[Bartolomé de las Casas]], an offspring of a merchant family from [[Seville]], dealing in the past with black African slaves brought to the Caribbean islands, apparently, since no less than 1501, borrowing perhaps, in some cases, of the sociological views on "evangelization" of  renowned [[Scotland|Scottish]] Professor at [[University of Paris]], c. 1510, [[John Major (philosopher)|John Mair]], (1467–1550).

'''Ludwig Darmstaedter''' (9 August 1846 – 18 October 1927) was a [[Germans|German]] [[chemist]] and [[history of science|historian of science]].

From 1865 he studied chemistry under [[Robert Bunsen]] and [[Emil Erlenmeyer]] at the [[University of Heidelberg]], then furthered his education in [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]] as a student of [[Hermann Kolbe]]. Afterwards, he relocated to Berlin, where he performed studies on alkali fusion of [[sulfonic acid]]s in the laboratory of [[Hermann Wichelhaus|Karl Hermann Wichelhaus]]. From 1872, with Benno Jaffé, he was involved with industrial chemical research; e.g. [[glycerin]] extraction. Later on in his career, he conducted investigations on the composition and synthesis of [[lanolin]].&lt;ref name=DB&gt;[http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz9327.html Darmstaedter, Ludwig] in: Neue Deutsche Biographie 3 (1957), S. 516 f. ([[Georg Lockemann]])&lt;/ref&gt;

His interest in the historical development of chemistry inspired him to compile an extensive collection of manuscripts of scientists ("''Dokumentensammlung Darmstaedter''") in the [[Prussian State Library]] at Berlin.&lt;ref name=DB/&gt; Since 1952 the ''[[Paul Ehrlich and Ludwig Darmstaedter Prize|Paul Ehrlich- und Ludwig Darmstaedter Preis]]'' has been awarded in Germany for outstanding contributions in the field of medicine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.uni-frankfurt.de/48209019/paul_ehrlich Paul Ehrlich- und Ludwig Darmstaedter-Preis] Goethe Universitat, Frankfurt am Main&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marcial Solana González-Camino''' (1880–1958) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] scholar, writer and politician. In science he is best known as historian of philosophy and author of a monumental work on 16th century Spanish thinkers, though he contributed also to history, theory of law and theology. In politics he is recognized chiefly as a [[Traditionalism (Spain)|Traditionalist]] theorist of state, apart from his rather modest militancy within [[Integrism (Spain)|Integrism]] and [[Carlism]]. Throughout all his life he was also active in various lay Catholic organizations.

In the early 19th century he already held a number of estates in the province and grew to the [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] deputy in the 1810s.&lt;ref&gt;González de Riancho Colongues 2009, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; His son, [[Pedro Solana Collado]] (1801-1868),&lt;ref&gt;most detailed work on Solana Collado is a booklet by his grandson, see Marcial Solana y González-Camino, ''Notas sobre la vida militar de Don Pedro Solana y Collado, coronel de Infantería (1801-1868)'', Madrid 1945.

When discussing his post-war fate, Solana González-Camino does not mention further service in the Isabelline army and focuses on the 1955 plot.

Though Marcial Rufo and Irene held a number of estates, they lived mostly at calle Calderon 5&lt;ref&gt;now calle Ataulfo Argenta&lt;/ref&gt; in Santander.&lt;ref&gt;Bueis Güemes 2014, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; They had only two children, Marcial’s sister born posthumously;&lt;ref&gt;Bueis Güemes 2015, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; the siblings were raised in a fervently Catholic ambience.&lt;ref&gt;Bueis Güemes 2015, pp. 41-42&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890 Marcial Augusto Justino&lt;ref&gt;Bueis Güemes 2014, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; took entry exams to Instituto de Segunda Ensañanza of Santander,&lt;ref&gt;now named to Instituto de Ensañanza Secundaria Santa Clara, Benito Madariaga, Celia Valbuena, ''El Instituto de Santander (Estudio y Documentos)'', Santander 1971, pp. 112-113&lt;/ref&gt; but for unclear reasons he pursued curriculum with the Jesuits in Orduña;&lt;ref&gt;full name Colegio Nuestra Señora de la Antigua de Orduña&lt;/ref&gt; he obtained [[bachillerato]], confirmed by Instituto de Bilbao, in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;Bueis Güemes 2015, p. 42, Bueis Güemes 2014, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; The same year he entered the [[University of Deusto|Jesuit Deusto institute]];&lt;ref&gt;at that time known as Colegio de Estudios Superiores de Bilbao, now known as Universidad de Deusto&lt;/ref&gt; in 1899 he graduated sobresaliente&lt;ref&gt;Deusto’s diplomas were not recognized automatically and its graduates had to take exams in state-ran institutions; in this case, Solana was examined in Universidad de Salamanca, Bueis Güemes 2015, p. 43 Bueis Güemes 2014, pp. 11-13&lt;/ref&gt; in Filosofia y Letras&lt;ref&gt;Bueis Güemes 2014, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1902, also sobresaliente, in law.&lt;ref&gt;Bueis Güemes 2015, pp. 44-45&lt;/ref&gt; Spared military service&lt;ref&gt;at turn of the centuries Solana received draft notes to the army, but there is neither any indication of him serving nor a clear exemption note; scholars speculate that he might have been exempted as half-orphan, a student or as „soldado de cuota”, Bueis Güemes 2015, p. 48, Bueis Güemes 2014, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; he commenced doctoral research in [[Madrid]]. In 1904 Solana obtained PhD laurels – sobresaliente – in law,&lt;ref&gt;the dissertation title was ''Exposición de la teoría penal clásica'', Bueis Güemes 2015, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1906 he paired it – always sobresaliente – with the one in philosophy, also in Madrid.&lt;ref&gt;the dissertation title was ''La verdad trascendental según la Filosofía Escolástica'', Bueis Güemes 2015, p. 48, Bueis Güemes 2014, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

There were many Carlist antecedents in Solana’s family; his grandfather served in the legitimist troops during the First Carlist War,&lt;ref&gt;Marcial’s father, aged 25 at the outbreak of the Third Carlist War, was in Cuba at the time and is not known to have joined the legitmists&lt;/ref&gt; while his maternal grand-uncle [[:es:Fernando Fernández de Velasco|Fernando Fernández de Velasco]] was a Carlist deputy in the 1860s&lt;ref&gt;see his record at the official Cortes service, available [http://www.congreso.es/portal/page/portal/Congreso/Congreso/SDocum/ArchCon/SDHistoDipu/SDIndHistDip?_piref73_1340024_73_1340023_1340023.next_page=/wc/servidorCGI&amp;CMD=VERLST&amp;BASE=DIPH&amp;FMT=DIPHXD1S.fmt&amp;DOCS=1-1&amp;DOCORDER=FIFO&amp;OPDEF=Y&amp;NUM1=&amp;DES1=&amp;QUERY=%2837520%29.NDIP. here]&lt;/ref&gt; and soldier during the [[Third Carlist War]].&lt;ref&gt;Bueis Güemes 2015, p. 307&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1880s both sided with the secessionist Integrist branch, joined by Marcial’s maternal uncle, José Zamanillo Monreal, who in the 1890s became the Integrist leader in [[Cantabria]].

Solana maintained correct relations with the Carlists&lt;ref&gt;see his joint 1916 endeavors with Juan Vázqeuz de Mella, ''El Pueblo Manchego'' 18.05.16, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;path=1081867&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; and in Santanderine institutions went with them well,&lt;ref&gt;especially the Santander Biblioteca Menendez Pelayo turned into a foco of cultural activity, with Traditionalists of Integrist and Carlist breeds collaborating; Solana was among the most eminent of them, Julián Sanz Hoya, ''De la resistencia a la reacción: las derechas frente a la Segunda República (Cantabria, 1931-1936)'', Santander 2006, {{ISBN|9788481024203}}, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; though noted also that "nuestra bandera es muy anterior y muy superior".&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 20.11.22, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000390423&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the 1931 declaration of the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republic]] he co-led the Integrist fraction advocating integration with Carlism&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Martorell Pérez, ''La continuidad ideológica del carlismo tras la Guerra Civil'' [PhD thesis in Historia Contemporanea, Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia], Valencia 2009, p. 358&lt;/ref&gt; and presided over the joint Integrist-[[Jaime, Duke of Madrid|Jaimist]] meeting in Cantabria, which finalized return to the "vieja mansión" of orthodox Carlism.&lt;ref&gt;''El Cruzado Español'' 20.11.31, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0029005838&amp;page=7 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Within the united [[Comunión Tradicionalista]] he initially did not land major posts, noted rather for activity as speaker across Spain,&lt;ref&gt;he was noted speaking e.g. in Burgos, Madrid, Barcelona, Seville and San Sebastian, Bueis Güemes 2015, pp. 56-57, Bueis Güemes 2014, p. 28. For an assortment of press reports see ''El Siglo Futuro'' 04.04.32, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000496828&amp;page=2 here] (Santander), ''El Siglo Futuro'' 05.07.32, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000500430&amp;page=1 here] (Madrid) or ''El Siglo Futuro'' 10.05.34, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000524867&amp;page=4 here] (Pamplona ). The last event was poorly attended by the youth; as recolled 5 years later, at the time the Carlist Navarrese youth preferred to practice military drills than listen to historical essays, ''Pensamiento Alaves'' 17.07.39, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=4&amp;path=1000035821&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; giving erudite lectures&lt;ref&gt;usually in Carlist círculos, Melchor Ferrer, ''Historia del tradicionalismo español'' vol. 30/2, Seville 1979, pp. 122, 125&lt;/ref&gt; about Traditionalism&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. his 1932 address titled ''El tradicionalismo; su razón de ser'', ''ABC'' 01.07.32, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1932/07/01/033.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; though rather seldom noted in the press as a key speaker.&lt;ref&gt;Carlist speakers taking the headlines were usually Pradera, Urraca Pastor, Senante, Lamamie and Rodezno. For an unusual case of Solana highlighted see ''ABC'' 05.07.32, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1932/07/05/021.html here]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1930s Solana became one of key Carlist theorists, referred to as "maestro del tradicionalismo".&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 31.05.31, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000511494&amp;page=3 here]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934 the [[Alfonso Carlos de Bourbon, Duke of San Jaime|claimant]] nominated him to Consejo de Cultura, guardians of the orthodoxy;&lt;ref&gt;Ferrer 1979, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; some scholars list him among "cupola tradicionalista".&lt;ref&gt;and give his name as an example of another phenomenon, namely Integrist overrepresentation in Comunión command layer, Manuel Martorell-Perez, ''Nuevas aportaciones históricas a la evolución ideológica del carlismo'', [in:] ''Gerónimo de Uztariz'' 16 (2000), p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934 Solana served as legal expert to his king.&lt;ref&gt;Solana referred to Don Alfonso Carlos as "nuestro caudillo augusto", see Marcial Solana, ''La intensigencia del tradicionalismo'', [in:] Eduardo Casariego (ed.), ''El tradicionalismo español. Su história, su ideario, sus hombres'', San Sebastián 1934, p. 73. It is not clear whether this type of addressing is indicative of affectional or rather cautious (refraining from clear monarchical references) stand of Solana, who generally underlining doctrinal rather than dynastical contents of Carlism&lt;/ref&gt; In three letters he addressed the succession issue, responding to Alfonso Carlos’ attempt to sort out the question of what happens after his death; Solana’s opinion was that the claimant was not free to appoint his successor and that an assembly of representatives had to participate in the process, the advice which might have heavily contributed to the regentialist solution eventually adopted.&lt;ref&gt;all were written in 1934 and in historiography are titled 1: ''Dictamen sobre la sucesión de los derechos de Don Alfonso Carlos I a la Corona de España, que por orden de Su Majestad emite Marcial Solana'', 2: ''Carta de Marcial Solana examinando si es aplicable a los miembros de la Dinastía Isabelina la pena que a los rebeldes contra el Rey señala la ley promulgada por Don Enrique III en las Cortes de Madrid del ańo 1390'', and 3. ''Respuesta a la pregunta de Su Majestad sobre si existe en el Derecho Espańol alguna disposición que castigue con la pérdida de los derechos sucesorios al miembro de la Familia Real que se rebele y haga armas contra el Rey legítimo, la da Marcial Solana''&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of present-day politics Solana was among key advocates of close monarchist collaboration within [[Acción Española]];&lt;ref&gt;another most active proponent of joint action with the Alfonsinos was Víctor Pradera, Martin Blinkhorn, ''Carlism and Crisis in Spain'', Cambridge 1975 [re-printed with no re-edition in 2008], {{ISBN|9780521086349}}, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; his study on right to resistance, often referred as pre-configuration of the 1936 coup, was published in the AE review.&lt;ref&gt;titled ''La resistencia a la tiranía, según los tratadistas del siglo de oro espańol'', Bueis Güemes 2014, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Don Alfonso Carlos y el marqués de Villores.png|thumb|160px|Carlist king [[Alfonso Carlos de Bourbon, Duke of San Jaime|Alfonso Carlos I]] (middle), 1931]]
It is not clear whether Solana was aware of Carlist preparations to the [[Spanish coup of July 1936|coup]], though he was aware that he might be among first targets of revolutionary violence; on his estates he maintained two secret hideouts. In unclear circumstances in late August 1936 he crossed the French frontier&lt;ref&gt;his biographer claims that Solana left Spain "rapidamente" via the Navarrese Dancharinea on August 31, 1936, Bueis Güemes 2015, p. 58. It is neither clear when and how Solana found himself in Navarre nor why he crossed to France, as Navarre was from the onset firmly controlled by the Nationalists&lt;/ref&gt; but soon returned and spent 1937 in [[Baztan, Navarre|Valle de Baztan]], following the Nationalist seizure of Cantabria returning to his Rosequillo estate.&lt;ref&gt;Bueis Güemes 2014, pp. 30-31&lt;/ref&gt; He is not listed as active member of the Carlist executive,&lt;ref&gt;the work discussing in detail Carlist debates prior and after the Unification Decree does not mention Solana a single time, see Juan Carlos Peñas Bernaldo de Quirós, ''El Carlismo, la República y la Guerra Civil (1936-1937). De la conspiración a la unificación'', Madrid 1996, {{ISBN|9788487863523}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet it is known he sided with [[Manuel Fal Conde|Fal]] against the [[:es:Decreto de Unificación|Unification Decree]].&lt;ref&gt;Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 366&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars suspect he was instrumental in drafting the 1939 memorandum to [[Francisco Franco|Franco]], which demanded restoration of Traditionalist monarchy;&lt;ref&gt;it was titled ''Manifestación de Ideales'' and was reportedly based on writings of Luis Hernando de on Larramendi, José María Aráuz de Robles and Marcial Solana, Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 371&lt;/ref&gt; in the early 1940s he was fined as engaged in technically illegal Comunión structures.&lt;ref&gt;"tampoco fue demasiado buena su relación con los tradicionalistas, como indica la multa impuesta a Marcial Solana así como los malentendidos producidos por los intentos de la Comunión Tradicionalista de mantener estructuras propia", Julián Sanz Hoya, ''La construcción de la dictadura franquista en Cantabria: Instituciones, personal político y apoyos sociales (1937-1951)'', Santander 2009, {{ISBN|9788481024869}}, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

Solana is hardly mentioned as busy in day-to-day party activity in the 1940s, though some scholars claim that as theorist he was absolutely vital for maintaining Carlist spiritual identity as opposed to the Francoist amalgamation, including drafting another memorandum, dated 1945.&lt;ref&gt;titled ''La única solución'', Martorell Pérez 2009, pp. 321-2, 354-5&lt;/ref&gt; He might have attended some meetings of Junta Nacional&lt;ref&gt;Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 366&lt;/ref&gt; and he surely attended the 1947 gathering of regional jefes, the first one after 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 321&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951 he managed to publish ''El tradicionalismo político español y la ciencia hispana'',&lt;ref&gt;Bueis Güemes 2015, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; the study completed in 1938; until today it is considered one of the most in-depth lectures of Traditionalism and perhaps the most important Solana’s contribution to both Traditionalism and Carlism. It also marked the climax of his engagement: in the 1950s Solana abandoned militancy and focused on scientific and Catholic duties.&lt;ref&gt;Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 366&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosopher==
[[File:Juan Vivès.JPG|thumb|left|160px|bust of [[Juan Vives|Juan Vivès]], [[Bruges|Flanders]]]]
Solana dedicated most of his scholarly attention to philosophy&lt;ref&gt;Bueis Güemes 2015, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; and though he fathered other attempts mostly in [[theology]], he excelled as historian.&lt;ref&gt;Bueis Güemes 2015, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; The question underlying most of his efforts is about existence of filosofía española, a category bearing features specific to the Spanish realm. His answer was to the affirmative. It was founded on assertion that a specifically Spanish philosophical approach was formulated in the 16th century, deemed Siglo de Oro,&lt;ref&gt;Bueis Güemes 2015, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; and owing its constituting features to [[Juan Luis Vives]], [[Francisco de Vitoria]], [[Francisco Suárez]], [[Domingo de Soto]] and [[Domingo Báñez]].&lt;ref&gt;Bueis Güemes 2015, pp. 116-117&lt;/ref&gt; It comprised a multitude of trends, yet its backbone was the late [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] school&lt;ref&gt;Solana started to demonstrate penchant for the Spanish scholastics already when writing his PhD dissertation, Bueis Güemes 2015, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; spanned between vivismo and suarismo;&lt;ref&gt;Bueis Güemes 2015, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; it gave rise to a number of currents which were to power the Spanish philosophy later on,&lt;ref&gt;"fueron los espańoles quienes elevaron la filosofía escolástica a la perfección que alcanzó en el siglo XVI. En cuanto al método filosófico, a las grandes síntesis doctrinales, a la recta disposición de los tratados filosóficos, a la presentación de un nuevo sistema filosófico (suarismo), a la presentación de nuevas cuestiones con sus soluciones y a la organización de nuevas ciencias (ontología, Teodicea, Lógica de la teología, Filosofía del Derecho, Derecho Penal y Derecho internacional)", Marcial Solana, ''Fueron los espańoles quienes elevaron la Filosofía escolástica a la perfección que alcanzó en el siglo XVI'', Madrid 1955, pp. 81-82&lt;/ref&gt; including [[logic]],&lt;ref&gt;case of Melchor Cano, Solana 1934, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; [[natural law]],&lt;ref&gt;case of Domingo de Soto, Solana 1934, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; [[penal law]],&lt;ref&gt;case of Alonso de Castro, Solana 1934, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; [[international law]],&lt;ref&gt;case of Francisco de Vitoria, Solana 1934, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; [[ontology]]&lt;ref&gt;case of Francisco de Zúñiga, Solana 1934, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; and their synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;case of Francisco Suarez, Solana 1934, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

Solana approached the Golden Age heritage very much in the [[Marcelino Menéndez y Pelayo|menendezpelayista]] manner,&lt;ref&gt;Solana was proud of his menendezpelayista approach, Bueis Güemes 2015, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; as multifold manifestations of orthodoxy confronting heterodoxy up to the 19th century, embodied last in works of [[Luis de Lossada]], [[Jaime Balmes]] and [[Zeferino González y Díaz Tuñón|Ceferino González]].&lt;ref&gt;Bueis Güemes 2015, pp. 116-117&lt;/ref&gt; He viewed the essence of original Spanish philosophy in unity with theology,&lt;ref&gt;Solana considered philosophy in service of the faith&lt;/ref&gt; fidelity to Catholic values and synthetic, holistic approach; the Spanish self was expressed in unity with God.&lt;ref&gt;as demonstrated in Spanish role when confronting Islam or the New World, Solana 1934, pp. 71-73&lt;/ref&gt; He preferred [[metaphysics]] and [[epistemology]] to other branches;&lt;ref&gt;Bueis Güemes 2015, pp. 116-117&lt;/ref&gt; the names quoted in his works most often are those of [[Aquinas]] and Menendez Pelayo. On the opposite end were the Liberal thinkers, even the iconic ones, and his references to [[Unamuno]] or [[Ortega y Gasset]] are extremely rare;&lt;ref&gt;though by the end of his life Solana ordered a book of Ortega, apparently intrigued by his popularity abroad&lt;/ref&gt; similarly he displayed scarce interest in foreign philosophers.
[[File:Franciscus Suarez, S.I. (1548-1617).jpg|thumb|160px|[[Francisco Suarez]]]]
Solana fathered some 60 works related to philosophy and theology;&lt;ref&gt;González de Riancho Colongues 2009, pp. 163-4&lt;/ref&gt; most are minor pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Bueis Güemes 2015, pp. 345-363&lt;/ref&gt; His opus magnum, not only in philosophy, is ''La Historia de la Filosofía Española. Época del Renacimiento'', a massive 3-volume work written in 1928-1933 and published in 1941;&lt;ref&gt;the first volume was 699 pages, the second one 604 pages and the third one 636 pages. The opus followed a homogenous pattern, discussing individual philosophers one by one; a biography was followed by discussion of works written, summary of thought and evaluation against the background of Spanish philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; a stepping stone towards it was an earlier 1927 study.&lt;ref&gt;''Los grandes escolásticos espańoles de los siglos XVI y XVII: sus doctrinas filosóficas y su significación en la Historia de la Filosofía''&lt;/ref&gt; A much smaller work dubbed synthesis of his thought was ''Fueron los españoles quienes elevaron la filosofía Escolástica a la perfección'' (1955).&lt;ref&gt;full title ''Fueron los espańoles quienes elevaron la filosofía Escolástica a la perfección que alcanzó en el siglo XVI''&lt;/ref&gt; Another huge work is a massive treaty on juridical systems according to the [[Thomism|Thomist]] epistemology (1925).&lt;ref&gt;''Exposición y crítica de los modernos sistemas jurídicos a la luz de la teoría tomista del conocimiento''. The work did not go into print; mechanographical copies spanned across 561 pages&lt;/ref&gt; Next to be listed are mid-size studies on scholastic thinkers,&lt;ref&gt;''La verdad trascendental según la Filosofía Escolástica'' (1904, his PhD thesis), ''Los grandes escolásticos espańoles de los siglos XVI y XVII: sus doctrinas filosóficas y su significación en la historia de la Filosofía'' (1928), a paper ''titled La justicia según la Summa Teológica de Santo Tomás de Aquino'' (1940)&lt;/ref&gt; followed by smaller works on scholastics&lt;ref&gt;''El principio Actiones sunt suppositorum según la Metafísica de Suárez'' (1944), ''Suárez, maestro de metafísica para teólogos'' (1948), ''La doctrina de Suárez sobre el primer principio metafísico'' (1948), ''Los primeros principios del conocimiento en orden a la demostración, según la doctrina del Padre Francisco Suárez de la Compańía de Jesús'' (1945), ''El principio y la causa según Suárez'' (1950), ''La Filosofía Espańola en el reinado del Emperador Carlos V'' (1950)&lt;/ref&gt; and traditionalists.&lt;ref&gt;''Existencia y caracteres distintos de la Filosofía espańola, según Menéndez Pelayo'' (1954), ''La doctrina estética de Balmes'' (1944), ''Doctrinas discordes de Balmes y Comellas acerca de la evidencia'' (1947) and ''Balmes y la Montańa'' (1949)&lt;/ref&gt; Solana published some 30 smaller works on theology, summarized as falling into "corrientes tomista, ignaciana y carmelitana";&lt;ref&gt;Bueis Güemes 2015, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; apart from historical work on [[Council of Trent]]&lt;ref&gt;''Estudios sobre el Concilio de Trento en su Cuarto Centenario. Valor teológico de la tradición. Un Abad de Santander en el Concilio de Trento'' (1946)&lt;/ref&gt; they dealt with dogmas of [[Trinity]], [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]], [[Eucharist]] and sovereignty of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;''Prologue'' to ''Defensio Fidei catholicae et apostolicae adversus Anglicanae sectae errores, del Padre Francisco Suárez'' (1917), ''La Sagrada Eucaristía y el alma nacional espańola'' (1927), ''La Soberanía de Dios'' (1934), ''La Asunción de la Santísima Virgen en cuerpo y alma a los cielos, demostrada en el siglo XIV por Don Juan Manuel'' (1950), ''El misterio de la Santísima Trinidad estudiado por Santo Tomás de Aquino'' (undated) and ''Transustanciación Eucarística'' (1929)&lt;/ref&gt; His sole major work which falls neither to history of philosophy nor to theology is an unpublished mid-size study ''La libertad del hombre'' (1947),&lt;ref&gt;paired with smaller and undated manuscript titled ''La libertad de emisión del pensamiento''&lt;/ref&gt; discussing conditions, attributes, types and objectives of human freedom to act; set in the Catholic orthodoxy, it opposed the [[Liberalism in Spain|Liberal]] concept of liberty and claimed that "la facultad de elegir entre el bien y el mal moral, de obrar rectamente o de pecar, es un absurdo verdadero e inaceptable'.&lt;ref&gt;Bueis Güemes 2015, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; Few works do not fit into above categories&lt;ref&gt;the largest one is ''El concepto de persona en Boecio y en la filosofía moderna'' (1955)&lt;/ref&gt; and few are translations.&lt;ref&gt;Solana also translated from Latin, Greek and French, Bueis Güemes 2015, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political theorist==
{{Main|Traditionalism (Spain)}}
[[File:Jaime Baumes.jpg|thumb|left|160px|[[Jaime Balmes]]]]
Solana’s political theory consists of a typical Traditionalist scheme and is rooted in classic Traditionalist works.&lt;ref&gt;his most quoted name was this of Juan Vázquez de Mella, followed by Enrique Gil Robles, Ramón Nocedal, Jaime Balmes, Antonio Aparisi and Juan Donoso Cortés, Bueis Güemes 2015, p. 117
  Bueis Güemes 2015, pp. 303-304&lt;/ref&gt; The objective of politics is "soberanía social de Dios",&lt;ref&gt;Bueis Güemes 2015, pp. 303-304&lt;/ref&gt; while the means is a regime founded on three principles. The first one is "monarquía hereditaria". The second one is "monarquía templada", i.e. royal powers moderated by collegial bodies representing the society.&lt;ref&gt;according to Solana the representation enjoyed by society in the Cortes "no son el resultado de la división social, subordinada, jerarquizada o estratificada como la concibe el marxismo o la economía política", but the result of traditional bodies and establishments, Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 369&lt;/ref&gt; The third one is "descentralización y autarquía",&lt;ref&gt;contemporary scholars maintain that when writing about autarchy Solana meant self-government, Jacek Bartyzel, ''Nic bez Boga, nic wbrew tradycji'', Radzymin 2015, {{ISBN|9788360748732}}; p. 113. He also used the term "organismo protárquico", see his ''El tradicionalismo'', p. 557&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. far-reaching self-government&lt;ref&gt;a contemporary scholars claims that Solana preferred to speak bout autarquía rathen than about autonomy as the latter was getting increasingly associated with peripheral nationalisms. For Solana, a region was a nation in statu nascendi which stopped developing, "naciones incipientes", "gérmenes de naciones que no llegaron a serlo", Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 367&lt;/ref&gt; of "intra-sovereign entities",&lt;ref&gt;literally "personas infrasoberanas", Bueis Güemes 2015, p. 298, Bartyzel 2015, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; communities organized on geographical,&lt;ref&gt;the geographic ones are best embodied in "sistema foral" as outlined in manifestos of Carlist royals, like Carlos VII issuing his Carta Manifiesto of 1869&lt;/ref&gt; professional, functional or any other basis.&lt;ref&gt;see Marcial Solana, ''¿Qué es el tradicionalismo político espańol?'', [in:] ''Tradición'' 1933, pp. 281-283&lt;/ref&gt; Solana’s own contribution is described as picking Traditionalist doctrine up where [[Juan Vázquez de Mella|de Mella]] left off and developing it to confront totalitarian theories emerging in the 1920s and 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Bartyzel 2015, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

Solana’s thought contained a strong anti-tyrannical thread, embodied already in the concept of a moderated monarchy; he also largely ignored his rival to the title of key party pundit, [[Víctor Pradera Larumbe|Víctor Pradera]], whose thought endorsed dictatorial solutions.&lt;ref&gt;Pradera was assassinted by the Republican militia and in the Nationalist zone he was treated as a martyr. Despite this, in Solana’s key political treaty, ''El Tradicionalismo político espańol'', written in 1937-1939, Pradera merited only "decena de citas"; in the same work Vázqued de Mella was mentioned 68 times, Gil Robles 46 times, Ramón Nocedal 34 times, Menéndez Pelayo 25 times and Antonio Aparisi 23 times, referred after Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 370. During his lifetime Pradera seemed mutually critical of Solana, referring to him as "distingyished caveman" ("caracterizado cavernícola") and noting that "not all of us have to live in a sty" ("no todos debemos vivir en las cochiqueras"), Bueis Güemes 2015, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; During the Republic Solana produced a treaty on the right to resist and to overthrow a despotic regime.&lt;ref&gt;''La resistencia a la tiranía, según los tratadistas del siglo de oro espańola'', printed in 4 parts in ''Acción Española'' of August and September 1934&lt;/ref&gt; However, an entirely new element introduced to Traditionalism was spelling out its incompatibility with [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] concepts. He went to great lengths denouncing [[Soviet]], [[Fascism|Fascist]] and [[Nazism|Nazi]] regimes,&lt;ref&gt;"pone especial interés en deslindar el corpus teórico del carlismo de los movimientos totalitarios tan de moda en el 'bando nacional'. Y para ello se detiene en estudiar algunas de las obras teóricas más importantes como La doctrina del fascismo, de Benito Mussolini (1935), el Mein Kampf de Adolf Hítler, el Gran informe sobre del fascismo (1929) y varios discursos pronunciados por el Duce", Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that the tyranny and deification of state which they introduce, combined with excessive [[nationalism]], render them "irreconcilable Traditionalist enemies".&lt;ref&gt;Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 257, Bartyzel 2015, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; Manuscript of his key theoretical work, completed in 1938, in its epilogue contained a veiled warning to Franco; it noted that Traditionalists would never support a regime based on foreign ideas,&lt;ref&gt;Solana pledged Traditionalist to support to any government, "monárquico o no, con la condición de que practique las ideas tradicionalistas españolas", but warned also that "al que no las practique no le seguiremos jamás y por los términos legales le combatiremos siempre, sea quien fuere, llámese como se llame", ''El tradicionalismo'' referred after Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 370&lt;/ref&gt; lamented "espantosa guerra civil que desangra a la Patria" and feared "que tanta sangre y tantas ruínas y tantas desgracias" might turn useless.&lt;ref&gt;"que tanta sangre y tantas ruinas y tantas desgracias no sean inútiles", ''El tradicionalismo'' referred after Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 370&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Juan Vazquez de Mella 1906.JPG|thumb|160px|[[Juan Vazquez de Mella]]]]
Like some Traditionalists, Solana welcomed democracy though he understood it simply as a principle of representation.&lt;ref&gt;Martorell Pérez 2009, pp. 369-370&lt;/ref&gt; Other a bit unorthodox piece of his concepts were references to "derechos del hombre",&lt;ref&gt;Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 369&lt;/ref&gt; praise of religious and educational liberties (though "rectamente entendida" and "para fínes lícitos"),&lt;ref&gt;Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 370. His biographer claims that though Solana advocated moral unity between state and church, he claimed that both should be separate and divided in therms of administration and economy; he reportedly opposed state subsidies to the Church, Bueis Güemes 2015, p. 14. This claim seems incompatible with Solana’s 1916 amendments to the state budget, referred in ''El Siglo Futuro'' 07.12.16, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000343215&amp;page=3 here]&lt;/ref&gt; notes that a human was the end and not the means&lt;ref&gt;Bueis Güemes 2015, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; and that "sociedad es para el hombre y no al revés".&lt;ref&gt;''El tradicionalismo'' p. 250, referred after Bueis Güemes 2015, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his writings contain highly exalted passages on exceptional role of the Spaniards, comments resemblant of typical nationalist discourse and quite atypical for Traditionalism.&lt;ref&gt;Solana 1934, pp. 71-73&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, as member of the movement which prided itself on belligerent past Solana was unusually bold in condemnation of "espiritú de violencia"; though he applied it mostly to foreign ideas,&lt;ref&gt;Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 257, Bartyzel 2015, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; he was also careful to note that notorious "Traditionalist intransigency" had its limits.&lt;ref&gt;namely the rules of Lord and the good of Spain, Solana 1934, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; Last but not least, he considered himself a Traditionalist rather than a Carlist.&lt;ref&gt;for Solana Carlism was more about a doctrine than about a dynasty, Pedro Sáinz Rodríguez, ''Testimonio y recuerdos'', Barcelona 1978, p. 295, Bueis Güemes 2015, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

As political theorist Solana was not a prolific writer. His legacy consists of one major work, ''El Tradicionalismo político español y la ciencia hispana'', written in 1937-1938 and published in 1951;&lt;ref&gt;Marcial Solana, ''El Tradicionalismo político espańol y la ciencia hispana'', Madrid 1951, 682 pages&lt;/ref&gt; it contains his vision of Traditionalist regime discussed against the Spanish theoretical background. The next to be listed is a mid-size treaty ''La resistencia a la tiranía'' (1933),&lt;ref&gt;the scholars discussed in the article are mostly Alonso de Castro, Domingo de Soto, Luis de Molina, Juan de Mariana and Juan Márquez&lt;/ref&gt; followed by some 10 small&lt;ref&gt;''El regionalismo'' (1918), ''La espańolización de Espańa por la Tradición'' (1932), ''Dońa Cirila González-Camino, tradicionalista ejemplar'' (1933), ''Tradicionalismo igual Navarrismo'' (1934)&lt;/ref&gt; and very small pieces.&lt;ref&gt;''El liberalismo, he ahí el enemigo'' (1933), ''Qué es el tradicionalismo político espańol?'' (1933), ''La intransigencia del tradicionalismo'' (1933), ''Quiénes pueden ser tiranos en los modernos regímenes democráticos y constitucionales?'' (1934), all 2-3 page notes&lt;/ref&gt; Out of these one should single out unpublished letters to Alfonso Carlos, in fact legal treaties on Carlist succession rules.&lt;ref&gt;Bueis Güemes 2015, pp. 300-304&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marcelino Menéndez Pelayo, por Kaulak.jpg|thumb|160px|left|[[Marcelino Menéndez y Pelayo|Menéndez Pelayo]]]]
Solana published some 40 works on history, mostly minor press articles he contributed from the 1910s&lt;ref&gt;Bueis Güemes 2014, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; to the 1950s. None of them is of general importance; his historiographic works which stand out are two mid-size biographical studies&lt;ref&gt;''Don Francisco Xavier de Villanueva y Sota. Comisario Ordenador de Marina'' (1931) and ''Notas sobre la vida militar de Don Pedro Solana y Collado Coronel de Infantería'' (1945)&lt;/ref&gt; and two [[heraldic]] dissertations,&lt;ref&gt;''El escudo de la ciudad de Santander'' (1922), ''La Heráldica en el Real Valle de Villaescusa. Biografía, Heráldica, Genealogía'', (1952)&lt;/ref&gt; followed by a number of smaller essays.&lt;ref&gt;''D. Fernando José de Velasco Ceballos y Fernández de Isla. La casa y solar de la Rueda'' (1925), ''D. Tomás Antonio Sánchez, según sus cartas. Homenaje a D. Tomás Antonio Sánchez en el II Centenario de su nacimiento'' (1926), ''El Arzobispo Don Joaquín de Santiyán según sus cartas íntimas'' (1931), ''Los Marinos Montańeses'' (1942) and a number of minor pieces contributed to Banco de Santander (1857-1957). ''Aportación al estudio de la historia económica de la Montańa'', Santander 1957; Solana worked as concejal for the bank, Bueis Güemes 2015, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from his PhD thesis in law he did not contribute to juridical science.&lt;ref&gt;perhaps a huge work discussed earlier as pertaining to philosophy, ''Exposición y crítica de los modernos sistemas jurídicos a la luz de la teoría tomista del conocimiento'' (1925) might be also considered related to jurisprudence&lt;/ref&gt; A separate section of his heritage are small and mid-size works related to Marcelino Menendez Pelayo,&lt;ref&gt;''Apostillas de Menéndez Pelayo a los estudios sobre la Filosofía de Santo Tomás'' (1927-1929), ''La colaboración de Laverde en la Ciencia Espańola de Menéndez Pelayo'' (1932), ''Un nuevo opúsculo sobre Menéndez Pelayo'' (1944), ''Los jesuitas en Menéndez Pelayo'' (1944), ''Menéndez Pelayo candidato a la dirección de la Real Academia Espańola'' (1946), ''Existencia y caracteres distintivos de la Filosofía Espańola, según Menéndez Pelayo'' (1954)&lt;/ref&gt; the scholar Solana considered his master.&lt;ref&gt;despite that they have never met in aula, Bueis Güemes 2015, p. 326&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from writing, Solana contributed to Spanish culture and science as manager, administrator and activist. In the 1920s he entered Sociedad Menéndez Pelayo&lt;ref&gt;Bueis Güemes 2014, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; and started contributing to its ''Boletín'', in 1940 becoming member of Junta Directiva.&lt;ref&gt;Solana greatly appreciated his entry into the Junta, Bueis Güemes 2015, p. 60, Bueis Güemes 2014, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934 he co-founded Centro de Estudios Montañes, nominated member of the board and jefe of sección de biografía; in 1939 he grew to vice-president and in 1940 to president.&lt;ref&gt;Solana resigned in 1944 and remained a member of the executive, Bueis Güemes 2015, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1930s he took part in works of Asociación Española para el Progreso de las Ciencias.&lt;ref&gt;Bueis Güemes 2014, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940 Solana entered [[Spanish National Research Council|Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas]].&lt;ref&gt;Bueis Güemes 2015, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945 he was invited to join [[Real Academia de Ciencias Morales y Políticas]] as académico correspondiente, admitted in 1951 upon his address ''Fueron los españoles quienes elevaron la Filosofía escolástica a la perfección''.&lt;ref&gt;Bueis Güemes 2015, pp. 61-2&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951 he was nominated Cronista del Real Valle de Villaescusa.&lt;ref&gt;Bueis Güemes 2015, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s he became a member of numerous provincial Santander bodies: Patronato de las Cuevas Prehistóricas,&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 21.08.55, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1948/08/24/pagina-5/32774359/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; provincial Consejo de Cultura,&lt;ref&gt;Bueis Güemes 2014, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; Universidad de Verano and Colegio Cántabro.&lt;ref&gt;González de Riancho Colongues 2009, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; Though not particularly active beyond his native Cantabria, at times Solana was recorded as delivering lectures – usually related to 16th-century Spanish philosophy – to scholarly and semi-scholarly audiences elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;for Granada see ''La Prensa'' 24.04.44, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;path=1000256476&amp;presentacion=pagina here], for Barcelona see ''Spain'' 1948, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=102&amp;path=3089255&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Accion catolica.png|thumb|160px|[[Acción Católica]] logotype]]
An entirely different thread is incessant Solana’s activity in religious organizations. Already during his academic years he was engaged in Apostolado de la Oración, Congregación de la Inmaculada y San Luis Gonzaga, Academia de Literatura Práctica de San Luis Gonzaga and Congregación Universal de la Casa Santa de Loreto.&lt;ref&gt;Bueis Güemes 2015, pp. 45-6&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s he entered the Malta Order,&lt;ref&gt;Bueis Güemes 2014, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; contributed to various religious assemblies,&lt;ref&gt;Bueis Güemes 2015, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; excelled in ACNDP&lt;ref&gt;Bueis Güemes 2015, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; and Acción Católica;&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 17.11.29, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/sevilla/abc.sevilla/1929/11/17/027.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1930s he was considered prospective member of Academia Pontífica de Ciencias.&lt;ref&gt;Bueis Güemes 2015, pp. 56-7&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1940s he limited himself to co-operation with the local Santander hierarchy, e.g. entering Comisión Ejecutiva for various reconstruction works;&lt;ref&gt;Bueis Güemes 2014, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1950s he acted as attorney for some real estates, held by the [[Diocese of Santander|Santander diocese]].&lt;ref&gt;Bueis Güemes 2015, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; Last but not least, he contributed financially to renovating local temples.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in 1951 contributing to renovation of Santuario de Socabarga&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and legacy==
[[File:Casa de los Lujanes - 01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Real Academia de Ciencias Morales y Políticas|RACMYP]] site]]
Some Solana's works were rewarded in the mid-1920s;&lt;ref&gt;''Relaciones entre el Derecho y la Moral según la doctrina de Santo Tomás de Aquino'' was rewarded at juegos florales of 1925, ''Exposición y crítica de los modernos sistemas jurídicos a la luz de la teoría tomista del conocimiento'' won the prize of University of Salamanca in 1925, papal nuncio rewarded Solana for his writings on Aquinas, also in 1925, see ''El Adelanto'' 25.03.25, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;path=1000350620&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; his first major honor was the 1927 Premio de Torreánaz, awarded by [[Real Academia de Ciencias Morales y Políticas|RACMYP]].&lt;ref&gt;for ''Los grandes escolásticos'', ''ABC'' 29.10.27, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1927/10/29/024.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Historia de la Filosofía'' was commenced as a response to grand competition to complete history of Spanish philosophy, launched by [[Asociación Española para el Progreso de las Ciencias]]; the work was submitted in 1933 and declared victorious in April 1936,&lt;ref&gt;Bueis Güemes 2015, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; earning Premio Echegaray.&lt;ref&gt;González de Riancho Colongues 2009, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; In the scholarly realm the reception was overwhelmingly positive, though with many reservations.&lt;ref&gt;Romero Raizabal noted that the work "no merece la importancia que le están dando. Tiene defectos tan notorios que hasta yo mismo los conozco". Ramón Ceńal Lorente wrote "en tono muy crítico" and fumed about poor introduction. Padre Crisógono claimed too much attention was dedicated to biography sections and too much focus was on mystic, logic and cosmovision. Domingos Maurício Gomes Dos Santos complained about Portuguese authors being underrepresented. Padre Goenaga complained about arbitrary choice of philosophers and too little synthesis, marginalised by descriptive accounts. Guillermo Fraile considered the periodisation debatable. Detailed discussion in Bueis Güemes 2015, pp. 22-32. Solana’s cousin Zamanillo laughed that no-one would ever bother to read "esto"; when asked how the jury would make their mind, Zamanillo suggested they would consider weight in kilograms, and hence Solana stood a high chance of winning, Bueis Güemes 2015, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; Solana’s position was already established; formal confirmation came with the 1945 invitation to RACMYP. Starting the 1950s Solana’s work on Renaissance Spanish philosophy became a must-have reference of any work dealing with history of Spanish philosophy&lt;ref&gt;Adolfo Muńoz Alonso, ''Las ideas filosóficas en Menéndez Pelayo'', Madrid 1956, p. 16, Joaquín de Encinas, ''La tradición espańola y la revolución'', Madrid, 1958, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; and some works covering Siglo de Oro seem based exclusively on Solana’s study, though not all credited him.&lt;ref&gt;the work of Frederick Copleston in its section relared to Siglo de Oro resembles Solana’s work in terms of selection of authors, contents and discussion, but contains no reference (except bibliographical address at the end), Frederick Copleston, ''Historia de la Filosofía'', Barcelona 1975, {{ISBN|9788434439375}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some, no better work has been written until today.&lt;ref&gt;"this is probably the most thorough history of Spanish philosophy of the Golden Age, but its direct summary format detracts somewhat from its usefulness", Henry W. Sullivan, ''Tirso de Molina &amp; the Drama of the Counter Reformation'', Amsterdam 1981, {{ISBN|9789062036936}}, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

Except necrological note&lt;ref&gt;S. F., ''Nota necrólogica: Don Marcial Solana y González-Camino'', [in:] ''Altamira'' 1958, pp. 464-467&lt;/ref&gt; Solana himself started earning brief biographical notes in the 1970s;&lt;ref&gt;Santiago Díez Llama, ''La situación socio-religiosa de Santander y el Obispo Sánchez de Castro (1884-1920)'', Santander 1971, José Simón y Cabarga, ''Prologo'', [in:] Marcial Solana, ''Don Francisco Xavier de Villanueva y Sota'', Santander 1975&lt;/ref&gt; he is acknowledged in most dictionaries and encyclopedias of Spanish philosophy,&lt;ref&gt;Alain Guy, ''Les Philosophes espagnoles d´hier et d´aujord´hui. Textes choisis et Époques et Auteurs'', Toulouse 1956, pp. 1-2, Clemente Fernández, ''Los filósofos escolásticos de los siglos XVI y XVII bibliographic references'', Madrid 1986, José Luis Abellán, ''Historia Crítica del Pensamiento Espańol'', Madrid 1992, Francisco Odriozola Argos, ''Gran Enciclopedia de Cantabria'', vol. VIII, pp. 100-101, 2003 Aurora Garrido Martín (ed.), ''Diccionario Biográfico de los parlamentarios de Cantabria (1902-2002)'', Santander 2003, pp. 178-180, Gonzalo Díaz Díaz, ''Hombres y Documentos de la Filosofía Espańola'', vol. VII, Madrid 2003, pp. 348-350&lt;/ref&gt; though there are few exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;José Ferrater Mora, Diccionario de Filosofía (all editions, also the last one of 1979) does not contain an entry on Solana, though the work quotes him many times&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond the realm of specialists, he remained largely forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;"la memoria de su vida, obra y pensamiento había quedado literalmente sepultada"; also "De Solana, en cambio, apenas nadie se ha acordado"; also "un autor muy valioso pero casi desconocido, muy citado pero poco estudiado", Bueis Güemes 2015, pp. 11, 17&lt;/ref&gt; He earned his first and so far the only monograph in the 2012 PhD thesis of his distant relative.&lt;ref&gt;Antonio de los Bueis Güemes, ''Vida, obra y pensamiento de Marcial Solana'' [PhD thesis Universidad de Salamanca], Salamanca 2012. The work was released commercially in two versons; a scaled down one was Antonio de los Bueis Güemes, ''Marcial Solana. Estudio crítico'', Madrid 2014 (no ISBN), and a full-blown one Antonio de los Bueis Güemes, ''Marcial Solana. Una vida en la tradición'', Santander 2015, {{ISBN|9788493867164}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work provides an all-round discussion of Solana, yet it clearly focuses on his work as historian of philosophy. Solana’s theory of state went into almost total oblivion;&lt;ref&gt;Solana is not mentioned in a recent encyclopedical entry on Spanish Traditionalism, see Pedro Carlos González Cuevas, ''Tradicionalismo'', [in:] Javier Fernández Sebastián (ed.), ''Diccionario político y social del siglo XX español'', Madrid 2008, {{ISBN|9788420687698}}, pp. 1163-1173&lt;/ref&gt; even within the Traditionalist and Carlist realm it is entirely overshadowed by later works of [[Francisco Elias de Tejada y Spinola|Elías de Tejada]] and [[Rafael Gambra Ciudad|Gambra]].&lt;ref&gt;a very recent monograph on Spanish Traditionalism mentions Solana 3 tines. In comparison, Vázquez de Mella is noted 57 times, Gambra 77 times and Elías de Tejada 113 times, see Bartyzel 2015. Among numerous Tradiitonalist websites, usually ignoring Solana, the exception is ''Hispanismo'' service, available [http://hispanismo.org/cultura-general/10860-figuras-intelectuales-del-patriotismo-espanol.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; Founders of the Left-wing [[Partido Carlista]] dismissed it as "escrito con una mentalidad reaccionaria".&lt;ref&gt;Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 412, Manuel Martorell Pérez, ''Carlos Hugo frente a Juan Carlos. La solución federal para España que Franco rechazó'', Madrid 2014, {{ISBN|9788477682653}}, p. 80, Ramón María Rodón Guinjoan, ''Invierno, primavera y otoño del carlismo (1939-1976)'' [PhD thesis Universitat Abat Oliba CEU], Barcelona 2015, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond specialists in Golden Age philosophers or in Traditionalism, in historiography and political science Solana is known mostly in relation to his 1933 article,&lt;ref&gt;the work was titled ''La resistencia a la tiranía, según la doctrina de los tratadistas del siglo de oro español''. It was published in 4 parts: 1) ''Acción Española'' 01.08.33, pp. 352-371, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0003661750&amp;page=32 here]; 2) ''Acción Española'' 16.08.33, pp. 442-461, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0003662539&amp;page=29 here]; 3) ''Acción Española'' 01.09.33, pp. 580-590, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0003663005&amp;page=36 here]; 4) ''Acción Española'' 16.09.33, pp. 1-8, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0003663278&amp;page=10 here]. Solana briefly discusses Plato and Aristotle (353-355) before moving to Aquinas. He first listed 3 reasons for complacency (p. 358) before moving to the issue of resistance; Solana claims also that according to Aquinas, also the secular power was to be obeyed if ruling to the benefit of order and justice (p. 361). According to Solana, Aquinas recommended passive resistance over an active one, namely to "evitar los males que acarrea el levantamiento contra el tirano" (p. 363). In Solana’s reading of Aquinas, if no mode of resistance (including the active one) was feasible, people should limit themselves to trust in God (p. 363). Most of the essay is dedicated to Spanish thinkers one by one (I: 364-371, II: 441-461, III:580-583), followed by their synthesis (III:583-590, IV:1-4). In the very final section Solana tackles the question whether the doctrine of siglo de oro theorists was applicable to tyranny as understood in the 1930s (IV:4-8). The answers was to the affirmative, conditional and with preference to passive resistance (p. 7)&lt;/ref&gt; discussing views of the Siglo de Oro theorists on tyrannical rule.&lt;ref&gt;at times also other Solana works are interpreted as instigation to rebellion against the Republic, e.g one scholar claims that in Solana’s 1934 address ''Tradicionalismo igual Navarrismo'' "la sublevación fue interpretada como una afirmación de la navarridad", Floren Aoiz, ''El jarrón roto: la transición en Navarra: una cuestión de Estado'', Tafalla 2005, {{ISBN|9788481363296}}, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; Referred to by both English and Spanish scholars as "lay theologian/teólogo seglar",&lt;ref&gt;Pedro Carlos González Cuevas, ''Las tradiciones ideologicas de la extrema derecha española'', [in:] ''Hispania'' LXI/1 (2001), p. 132, Pedro Carlos González Cuevas, ''Historia de las derechas españolas: de la Ilustración a nuestros días'', Madrid 2000, {{ISBN|8470307169}}, p. 332. The English-language verson can be found in numerous works, see e.g. Martin Blinkhorn, ''Spain in conflict 1931-1939: democracy and its enemies'', London 1986, {{ISBN|9780803997455}}, p. 161. Other tag attached is "ideólogo reaccionario", Eduardo González Calleja, ''La violencia y sus discursos: los límites de la "fascistización" de la derecha española durante el régimen de la II República'', [in:] ''Ayer'' 71 (2008), p. 93 and Solana could be counted among "otros clérigos", Ramiro Trullén Floría, ''España trastornada'', Madrid 2016, {{ISBN|9788446043393}}&lt;/ref&gt; he is noted for "legitimization of the 1936 coup".&lt;ref&gt;"legitimar el alzamiento de julio de 1936", González Cuevas 2001, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; Not infrequently he is singled out among most prominent theorists&lt;ref&gt;"among the many minor works and essays justifying the rebellious stance of Catholic public law that appeared during the Republic, the following deserve a mention" there are 3 titles listed, among them the one of Solana, Eduardo González Calleja, ''The symbolism of violence during the Second Republic in Spain, 1931-1936'', [in:] Chris Ealham, Michael Richards, ''The splinering of Spain'', Cambridge 2005, {{ISBN|9780521821780}}, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; who "used Aquinas"&lt;ref&gt;"Solana used Aquinas to justify the assertion that the tyrant was any oppressive or unjust government", Paul Preston, ''The Spanish Holocaust: Inquisition and Extermination in Twentieth-Century Spain'', London 2012, {{ISBN|9780007467228}}. In fact, out of 56 pages of Solana’s work only 8 were dedicated to Aquinas. Solana did not advance own claims as to what was right but styled his work as referring thought of earlier philosophers. Finally, Solana noted that according to the authors referred, a regime must share a number of features before resistance to its rule would be justified&lt;/ref&gt; and "produced theological justifications for the violent overthrow of the Republic", "argued that violence against the Republic was justified",&lt;ref&gt;Preston 2012, available online [https://books.google.es/books?id=mzntTDf6AZ4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Spanish+Holocaust:+Inquisition+and+Extermination+in+Twentieth&amp;hl=pl&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=solana&amp;f=false here]&lt;/ref&gt; instigated anti-Semitism by disseminating the idea "that there was a Jewish-Masonic-Bolshevik plot” and "the political left had thus to be annihilated at all cost".&lt;ref&gt;Nil Santianez, ''Topographies of Fascism: Habitus, Space, and Writing in Twentieth-century Spain'', Toronto 2013, {{ISBN|9781442645790}}, p 135. In fact, the article contained not a single reference to Jews, Masons or Bolsheviks. Neither did the text mention destruction, annihilation or extermination of the enemy. Then, instead of referring to "at all cost" opposition, it listed a number of conditions that must be met before resistance to a tyrant is offered, and clearly expressed preference for passive over active resistance&lt;/ref&gt; The article provided rationale for counting Solana among architects of "the Spanish Holocaust" and "theorists of extermination".&lt;ref&gt;Preston 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Finca de Riosequillo.jpg|thumb|Rosequillo estate today]]
In his last will Solana marked funds and a large Villaescusa plot&lt;ref&gt;slightly excededing 4 ha, ''Boletín Oficial de la Provincia de Santander'' 15.10.76, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=39&amp;path=1000348798&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; for Fundación Marcial Solana, entrusted with setting up a college in La Concha. The task has not been completed and currently the estate hosts Centro de Estudios de la Administración Regional de Cantabria.&lt;ref&gt;Bueis Güemes 2015, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; Other plots in La Concha, owned by his heirs, were expropriated in the late 1970s; it is not clear whether naming a new kindergarten and primary education establishment opened in the early 1980s, Centro de Educación Infantil y Primaria Marcial Solana, was compensation or remained otherwise related to the expropriation deal.&lt;ref&gt;''Boletín Oficial de la Provincia de Santander'' 08.02.80, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=8&amp;path=1000349321&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; Currently the Centro staff is militantly engaged in promoting progressive gender theories.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. the assumption that girls like roses and boys like football is considered gender violence; the Centro Infantil staff paraded 31 children, aged 5-8, to deliver such a message on ''youtube'' service, available  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zC3-uooiXLA here]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maximilian Wolfgang Duncker''' (15 October 1811 – 21 July 1886) was a German historian and politician.

==Life==

Duncker was born in Berlin, [[Province of Brandenburg]], as the eldest son of the publisher [[Carl Friedrich Wilhelm Duncker|Karl Duncker]]. He studied at the universities of [[university of Bonn|Bonn]] and [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]] till 1834, was then accused of participation in the students' societies, which the government was endeavouring to suppress, and was condemned to six years' imprisonment, afterwards reduced to six months. He had already begun his labours as a historian, but after serving his sentence in 1837, found himself debarred till 1839 from completing his course at [[University of Halle|Halle]], where in 1842 he obtained a professorship.

Elected to the [[Frankfurt Parliament]] in 1848, he joined the Right Centre party, and was chosen reporter of the projected constitution. He sat in the [[Erfurt assembly]] in 1850, and in the [[Prussian House of Representatives|second Prussian chamber]] from 1849 to 1852. During the [[First Schleswig War|crisis in Schleswig and Holstein]] in 1850 he endeavoured in person to aid the duchies in their struggles. An outspoken opponent of the policy of [[Edwin Freiherr von Manteuffel|Manteuffel]], he was refused promotion by the Prussian government, and in 1857 accepted the professorship of history at [[university of Tübingen|Tübingen]]. In 1859, however, he was recalled to Berlin as assistant in the ministry of state in the cabinet of [[Charles Anthony, Prince of Hohenzollern]]. At that time, [[Rudolf von Auerswald]], a minister without portfolio, led the government in all but name. In 1861 was appointed councillor to the crown prince. In 1867 he became director of the Prussian archives, with which it was his task to incorporate those of [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]], [[Electorate of Hesse|Hesse]] and [[Duchy of Nassau|Nassau]]. He retired on 1 January 1875, and died at [[Ansbach]].

==Legacy==

Duncker's eminent position among German historians rests mainly on his "''Geschichte des Alterthums''" (1st edition, 1852–1857; English translation by [[Evelyn Abbott]], 1877–1882). He edited, with [[Johann Gustav Droysen|J.G. Droysen]], "''Preussische staatsschriften aus der regierungszeit König Friedrichs II''", and "''Urkunden und Actenstucke zur Geschichte des Kurfürsten Friedrich Wilhelm von Brandenburg''".
To the period of his political activity belong:
* ''Zur Geschichte der deutschen Reichsversammlung in Frankfurt'' (1849).
* ''Heinrich von Gagern: eine biographische Skizze'' (1850), in the series of Männer der Gegenwart.
* ''Vier Monate auswärtiger Politik'' (1851); anonymous, attributed to Max Duncker.
His other works include:
* ''Origines Germanicae. Commentatio prima'' (1840).
* ''Die Krisis der Reformation ein Vortrag in der Versammlung der protestantischen Freunde zu Halle am 6. August'' (1845), lecture. 
* ''Feudalität und Aristokratie'' (1858).
* ''Aus der Zeit Friedrichs des Grossen und Friedrich Wilhelms III. Abhandlungen zur preussischen Geschichte'' (1876).
* ''Abhandlungen aus der griechischen Geschichte'' and ''Abhandlungen aus der neueren Geschichte'' (1887), both works published after his death.

'''Michael Geddes'''  LL.D. (1650?–1713) was a Scottish clergyman of the [[Church of England]] and historian.

==Life==

He was born in Scotland about 1650, and educated at the [[University of Edinburgh]], where he took the degree of M.A. in 1668. He was incorporated at Oxford on 11 July 1671, as one of the first four Scots who benefited by Bishop [[John Warner (bishop)|John Warner]]'s [[exhibition (scholarship)|exhibitions]] intended for [[Balliol College]]. These scholars were first placed in [[Gloucester Hall]], but in 1672 they were moved to Balliol.

In 1678 Geddes went to [[Lisbon]] as chaplain to the English factory. In 1686 he was forbidden by the Inquisition to continue his functions, although he pleaded a traditional privilege, founded on the treaty between England and Portugal. The English merchants wrote immediately to [[Henry Compton (bishop)|Henry Compton]], [[bishop of London]], to assert their rights; but before their letter reached its destination Geddes was suspended by the ecclesiastical commissioners appointed by [[James II of England|James II]]. Matters had to await the arrival of [[Charles Scarborough]], the English envoy, and Geddes returned in May 1688 to England,.

[[Gilbert Burnet]] as [[bishop of Salisbury]] collated Geddes to the chancellorship of his cathedral on 12 June 1691. The [[Lambeth degree]] of LL.D. was conferred on Geddes, 16 April 1695, by Archbishop [[Thomas Tenison]]. He died in the early part of 1713.

==Works==
His works are: 

* ‘The History of the Church of Malabar, from the time of its being first discover'd by the Portuguezes in the year 1501. … Together with the synod of Diamper, celebrated in … 1599, done out of Portugueze into English. With some remarks upon the faith and doctrines of the Christians of St. Thomas in the Indies,’ London, 1694.
* ‘The Church-History of Ethiopia. Wherein the two great … Roman missions into that empire are placed in their true light. To which are added an epitome of the Dominican History of that Church, and an account of the practices and conviction of Maria of the Annunciation, the famous nun of Lisbon,’ London, 1696.

Published from the original manuscripts in Spanish … with an introductory discourse concerning Councils, showing how they were brought under bondage to the Pope,’ London, 1697. The manuscripts consisted of original letters addressed by [[Francisco de Vargas y Mexia]] to [[Cardinal Granvelle]], that came into the possession of [[William Trumbull (diplomat)|Sir William Trumbull]]. [[Edward Stillingfleet]] had them, and requested Geddes to translate them.
* ‘Miscellaneous Tracts,’ 3 vols. London, 1702–6,; 2nd edit. 1709; 3rd edit. 1715.

She was a key figure in the study of Aboriginal history in Canada's academic world.

== Personal life ==
Dickason was born on 6 March 1920 in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], to parents Frank Leonard Williamson and Phoebe Philomena Côté. Her family moved to the [[Interlake Region|Interlake]] region{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} after losing everything they owned during the [[Great Depression in Canada|Great Depression]]. Aged 12, she, her sister Alice, and her mother Phoebe went trapping and fishing to provide food for the family. "Living in the bush as I did during my adolescent years, I very soon learned that survival depended upon assessing each situation as it arose, which calls for common sense and realism", said Olive. "You neither give up nor play games." Encouraged by her mentor, the priest [[Athol Murray]], she decided to finish high school in [[Saskatchewan]], prior to pursuing post-secondary education. She completed a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in French and philosophy at [[Athol Murray College of Notre Dame|Notre Dame College]], an affiliate of the [[University of Ottawa]].

She first became aware of her [[Métis]] ancestry as a young adult upon meeting some Métis relatives in [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]].

Dickason had three daughters: Anne, Clare, and Roberta. Olive Dickason died on 12 March 2011, one week after her 91st birthday.

== Career ==
She began a 24-year career in journalism at the ''[[Regina Leader-Post]]'' and subsequently, worked as a writer and editor at the ''[[Winnipeg Free Press]]'', the ''[[Montreal Gazette]]'', and ''[[The Globe and Mail]]''. She promoted coverage of First Nations and women's issues.

In 1970, aged 50, she entered the graduate program at the University of Ottawa. She had to struggle with faculty preconceptions regarding Aboriginal history&amp;nbsp;– including arguments that it did not exist&amp;nbsp;– before finally finding a professor, [[Cornelius Jaenen]], to act as her academic advisor. "I was lucky&amp;nbsp;... [a] Belgian fellow, who didn't know much about Native people, but knew a lot about discrimination, took up my cause, and the university eventually admitted me." She completed her master's degree at the University of Ottawa with the thesis ''Louisburg and the Indians: A Study in Imperial Race Relations, 1713–1760''&lt;ref name="Posner 2011"&gt;{{cite news |last=Posner |first=Michael |author-link=Michael Posner (journalist) |date=17 April 2011 |title=Olive Dickason Wrote the Book on Native History in Canada |url=http://v1.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20110416.OBDICKASONATL/BDAStory/BDA/deaths/?pageRequested=all |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |location=Toronto |access-date=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; two years later, and her PhD in 1977. Her doctoral thesis, entitled ''The Myth of the Savage'', was eventually published as were ''Canada's First Nations: A History of Founding Peoples from the Earliest Times'' and ''The Native Imprint: The Contribution of First Peoples to Canada's Character -- Volume 1: to 1815'' (1995), which she edited. In addition she also wrote ''Indian Arts in Canada'', which won three awards for conception and design and coauthored ''The Law of Nations and the New World''.

Dickason taught at the [[University of Alberta]] from 1976 to 1992. She retired from this professorship when she was 72, after fighting the mandatory retirement at age 65. Dickason filed a complaint with the Alberta Human Rights Commission against the [[University of Alberta]], claiming its mandatory retirement policy was a violation of the Alberta Individual's Rights Protections Act.&lt;ref name = SCC&gt;[https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/915/index.do ''Dickason v.

== Awards ==
Olive was awarded the [[Order of Canada]] in 1996,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.gg.ca/honour.aspx?id=3490&amp;t=12|title=Olive Patricia Dickason, C.M., Ph.D., D.Litt.|work=The Governor General of Canada|accessdate=25 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the recipient of the [[Indspire Awards|Aboriginal Achievement Award]], now the Indspire Awards, in 1997.

'''Oltenia''' ({{IPA-ro|olˈteni.a}}, also called '''Lesser [[Wallachia]]''' in antiquated versions, with the alternate [[Latin]] names ''Wallachia Minor'', ''Wallachia Alutana'', ''Wallachia Caesarea'' between 1718 and 1739) is a historical province and geographical region of [[Romania]] in western Wallachia. It is situated between the [[Danube]], the [[Southern Carpathians]] and the [[Olt River|Olt]] river.

== History ==
{{History of Romania}}

=== Ancient times ===
{{Main|Getae|Dacians|Dacia|Domitian's Dacian War|Trajan's Dacian Wars|Roman Dacia}}

[[File:Sucidava Corabia.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sucidava]] - ancient Roman citadel at [[Corabia]]]]
Initially inhabited by [[Dacians]], Oltenia was incorporated in the [[Roman Empire]] (106, at the end of the [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|Dacian Wars]]; ''see [[Roman Dacia]]''). In 129, during [[Hadrian]]'s rule, it formed '''Dacia Inferior''', one of the two divisions of the province (together with '''Dacia Superior''', in today's [[Transylvania]]); [[Marcus Aurelius]]' administrative reform made Oltenia one of the three new divisions (''tres Daciae'') as '''Dacia Malvensis''', its capital and chief city being named [[Romula]]. It was colonized with [[veteran]]s of the [[Roman legion]]s. The Romans withdrew their administration south of the Danube at the end of the 3rd century and Oltenia was ruled by the ''foederati'' [[Germanic tribes|Germanic]] [[Goths]]. In the late 4th century Oltenia came under the rule of the [[Taifals]] before invasion by the [[Huns]].

=== Middle Ages ===
{{Main|Origin of the Romanians|Romania in the Early Middle Ages|Romania in the Middle Ages|Foundation of Wallachia}}

[[File:Horezu bis man NE.jpg|thumb|left|[[Horezu Monastery]] - UNESCO World Heritage]]

From 681, with some interruptions, it was part of the [[Bulgarian Empire]] (see [[Bulgarian lands across the Danube]]).
[[File:Banate of severin.png|thumb|left|Banate of Severin]]
In 1233, the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] formed the [[Banate of Severin]] in the eastern part of the region that would persist until the 1526 [[Battle of Mohács]].

Around 1247 a polity emerged in Oltenia under the rule of [[Litovoi]]. The rise of the mediaeval state of [[Wallachia]] followed in the 14th century, and the [[voivode]] ([[List of rulers of Wallachia|Prince of Wallachia]]) was represented in Oltenia by a [[Ban (title)|ban]] - "the [[Great Ban of Craiova]]" (with seat in [[Craiova]] after it was moved from [[Strehaia]]). This came to be considered the greatest office in Wallachian hierarchy, and one that was held most by members of the [[Craiovești]] family, from the late 15th century to about 1550. The title would continue to exist up until 1831.

During the 15th century, Wallachia had to accept the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[suzerainty]] and to pay an annual [[tribute]] to keep its autonomy as a vassal. From the Craiovești family, many bans cooperated with the Turks. However, many rulers, including the Oltenian-born [[Michael the Brave]], fought against the Ottomans, giving Wallachia brief periods of independence.

=== Modern times ===
{{Main|Early Modern Romania|History of the Russo-Turkish wars|Phanariotes|National awakening of Romania}}

After 1716, the Ottomans decided to cease choosing the voivodes from among the Wallachian boyars, and to appoint foreign governors. As the governors were Orthodox Greeks living in [[Phanar]], Constantinople, this period is known as the [[Phanariote]] regime.

[[File:Empire Autricien au XVIII. siecle.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Oltenia under the [[Austrian Empire]] in the 18th century]]

Two years later, in 1718 under the terms of the [[Treaty of Passarowitz]],{{sfn|Ingrao|Samardžić|Pešalj|2011}} Oltenia was split from Wallachia and annexed by the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] (''de facto'', it was under Austrian occupation by 1716); in 1737, it was returned to Wallachia under Prince [[Constantine Mavrocordatos]] (''see [[Austro-Turkish War of 1716–1718]] and [[Austro-Russian–Turkish War (1735–1739)]]''). Under the occupation, Oltenia was the only part of the [[Danubian Principalities]] (with the later exception of [[Bukovina]]) to experience [[Enlightened absolutism]] and Austrian administration, although these were met by considerable and mounting opposition from [[Conservatism|conservative]] [[boyar]]s. While welcomed at first as liberators, the Austrians quickly disenchanted the inhabitants by imposing rigid administrative, fiscal, judicial and political reforms which were meant to centralize and integrate the territory (antagonizing both ends of the social spectrum: withdrawing [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]]s from the nobility and enforcing taxes for peasants).

In 1761, the residence of Bans was moved to [[Bucharest]], in a move towards [[Centralized government|centralism]] (a ''[[kaymakam]]'' represented the boyars in Craiova). It remained there until the death of the last Ban, [[Barbu Văcărescu]], in 1832.

In 1821, Oltenia and [[Gorj County]] were at the center of [[Tudor Vladimirescu]]'s uprising (''see [[Wallachian uprising of 1821]]''). Vladimirescu initially gathered his [[Pandur|Pandurs]] in [[Padeș]] and relied on a grid of fortified monasteries such as [[Tismana]] and Strehaia.

== Symbol ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Coloana Infinitului 2.JPG|thumb|left|Brancusi - The Endless Column in [[Târgu Jiu]]]] --&gt;
The traditional heraldic symbol of Oltenia, also understood to represent [[Banat]], is part of the [[coat of arms of Romania]] (lower ''dexter''): on ''[[gules]]'' field, an ''[[Or (heraldry)|or]]'' [[Lion (heraldry)|lion]] rampant, facing ''dexter'', holding a sword, and standing over an ''or'' bridge (Apollodorus of Damascus Bridge at Drobeta Turnu Severin) and stylised waves.

== Geography ==
[[File:Lesser Wallachia.svg|thumb|left|The counties which comprise Oltenia]]
[[File:Alt-olt.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Olt River]] separates Oltenia from Muntenia]]
[[File:The suspended bridge, in Nicolae Romanescu Park, Craiova, Romania.jpg|thumb|right|Suspended bridge in [[Craiova]]'s [[Nicolae Romanescu Park]]]]

Oltenia is part of the [[Sud-Vest (development region)|Sud - Vest development region]]. It entirely includes the [[Counties of Romania|counties]]:
* [[Gorj County|Gorj]]
* [[Dolj County|Dolj]]
and parts of the counties:
* [[Mehedinți County|Mehedinți]] (mainly in Oltenia, but the western part belongs to [[Banat]])
* [[Vâlcea]] (mainly in Oltenia, but the eastern part belongs to [[Muntenia]])
* [[Olt County|Olt]] (the western half, the former Romanați county)
* [[Teleorman County|Teleorman]] (only the village [[Islaz]])

Oltenia's main city and seat for a majority of the late [[Middle Ages]] is [[Craiova]]. The first medieval seat of Oltenia was [[Turnu Severin]], anciently called Dobreta, in the [[Banate of Severin]]. That city is located near the site of [[Trajan's Bridge]], built by [[Apollodorus of Damascus]] for [[Emperor Trajan]] in his conquest of the region.

She comes from a low-income peasant family and had only completed two years of middle school before joining the [[FARC]] guerrilla by the late 1980s.

==Capture==
She was captured by the [[Military of Colombia|Colombian Military]] on February 10, 2004 in a location called Peñas Coloradas, jurisdiction in the Municipality of [[Cartagena de Chairá]] and was taken to the [[Larandia Air Force Base|Larandia AB]] to be interrogated mainly about the three Americans the FARC had kidnapped and about FARC's [[Chain of Command of the FARC-EP|Secretariat]]. She was later transferred to many other locations for security reasons.

==Extradition==

The [[United States]] accused "Sonia" of directly negotiating illegal drugs deliveries to [[Peru]]vian and [[Brazil]]ian drug traffickers.
Sonia was handed to [[Drug Enforcement Administration|U.S. officials]] on March 9, 2004 at [[Ernesto Cortissoz International Airport|Barranquilla's Airport]] in northern Colombia.

==U.S. Trial==
On February 20, 2007, Sonia was convicted of drug charges in a [[Washington D.C.]] court.

[[Image:Benedict XVI Poland 5.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pope Benedict XVI]] wearing the red leather Papal shoes]]
[[Image:Rote Loafer Papst Benedikt.jpg|thumb|upright|A set of red [[slip-on shoe|loafers]], manufactured by papal shoemaker Adriano Stefanelli, Novara, worn by Pope Benedict XVI. [[The Philippi Collection]].]]
The '''Papal shoes''' were the red leather outdoor shoes worn by the [[Pope]]. They should not be confused with the indoor [[Papal Slippers]] or the [[Episcopal sandals]], which are the liturgical footwear proper to all ordained [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishops]] of the [[Latin Rite]].

==Description==
As did many noblemen, the Pope wore slippers (''pantofole'') inside his residences and leather shoes outside. The indoor [[Papal Slippers]] were made of red velvet or silk and were heavily decorated in [[gold braid]], with a gold cross in the middle.

Throughout Church history, the color red has been deliberately chosen to represent the blood of Catholic martyrs spilt through the centuries following in the footsteps of Christ. The red papal shoes are also linked to Christ's own bloodied feet as he was prodded, whipped, and pushed along the Via Dolorosa on his way to his crucifixion, culminating in the piercing of his hands and feet on the cross.  The red shoes also symbolize the submission of the Pope to the ultimate authority of Jesus Christ. Beyond this, it is said the red papal shoes also signify God’s burning love for humanity as exhibited during Pentecost when red vestments are worn to commemorate the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the apostles as tongues of fire rest upon their heads. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://catholicexchange.com/red-shoes-and-the-room-of-tears| title=Red shoes and the room of tears}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 1969, the Pope, like all [[bishop]]s and [[prelate]]s, wore [[episcopal sandals]] during the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]. The color of the Episcopal sandals varied to match the [[liturgical color]] of the Mass.

The Papal outdoor shoes were made of plain red [[Morocco leather]] and had a wide cross in gold braid. The cross once extended across the shoe and down to the sole.  In the eighteenth century the ends of the cross were shortened, as shown in the photo of Pius VII's shoes. This old-fashioned type of dress shoe is very thin-soled and is sometimes called "pantofola liscia" or smooth slipper model.

After 1958, [[Pope John XXIII]] added gold buckles to the outdoor papal shoes, making them similar to the red shoes worn by cardinals outside of Rome. [[Pope Paul VI]] eliminated the gold cross and completely discontinued the custom of kissing the papal foot. Paul VI can be seen wearing red buckled shoes in photographs from his 1964 trip to Jerusalem. In 1969, Paul VI abolished buckles from all ecclesiastical shoes, which had been customarily required at the [[Papal Court]] and for [[prelate]]s. He also discontinued the use of the indoor velvet [[papal slipper]]s and the Paschal mozzetta and shoes. Paul VI wore plain red leather shoes throughout the rest of his pontificate. [[Pope John Paul I]], who was pope for only 33 days, continued wearing the plain red leather shoes worn by Paul VI. Early in his pontificate [[Pope John Paul II]] wore red shoes; however he later  adopted wearing brown shoes. Paul VI, John Paul I, and John Paul II were buried in the red leather papal shoes.

[[Pope Benedict XVI]] restored the use of the red papal shoes, which were provided by his personal [[Shoemaking|cobbler]], Adriano Stefanelli of Novara, who has several pictures and documents in his shoe-shop attesting the fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://ansaa.it/web/notizie/rubriche/english/2013/02/22/Red-shoes-made-order-signature-pope_8294283.html| title=Red shoes made to order as signature for pope| publisher=[[Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata]]| date=27 February 2013| accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://dailynightly.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/03/09/17240975-spiritual-craftsmanship-meet-the-popes-shoemaker?lite| title=Spiritual craftsmanship: Meet the pope's shoemaker| publisher=[[NBC News]]| first=Carlo| last=Angerer| accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008, Pope Benedict XVI also restored the use of the white [[damask]] silk [[Paschal mozzetta]], which was previously worn with white silk slippers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB114591920439834611| title=Does The Pope Wear Prada?| date=25 April 2006| work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]| location=[[New York City]]| accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- papal taylor: [[Ditta Annibale Gammarelli]]--&gt;

Pope Francis has chosen to wear black shoes, forgoing the tradition for his papacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Pope Francis ditches red shoes| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/the-pope/9932983/Pope-Francis-ditches-red-shoes.html| first=Nick| last=Squires| date=15 March 2013| work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]| location=[[London]]| accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The papal shoes, along with the [[camauro]], [[papal mozzetta]], and cloak (tabarro), are the only remnants of the former red color of the papal garments. [[Pope St. Pius V]] (1566 - 1572), who was a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]], changed the papal color to white by continuing to wear the white color of his Dominican religious order, and it has remained so since.

The '''Paris Opera Ballet''' ([[French language|French]]: "Ballet de l'Opéra national de Paris") is an integral part of the [[Paris Opera]] and the oldest national [[ballet company]]. Together with the Mariinsky Ballet, [[Bolshoi Ballet|Moscow Bolshoi Ballet]] and the [[Royal Ballet|London Royal Ballet]] it is regarded as one of the four most preeminent ballet companies in the world.&lt;ref&gt;"There are three world-best ballet companies, unquestionably the Royal Ballet, unquestionably the Bolchoi Ballet, and unquestionably the Paris Opera Ballet" - « Il y en a trois meilleures compagnies du monde, sans doute Le Royal Ballet, sans doute Le Bolchoï et sans doute Le Ballet de l'Opéra de Paris.», Philippe Noisette, journaliste, dans [http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xwb6wm_danse-a-tout-prix-1ere-partie_sport La Danse à tout prix], television documentary by Carlos Simoes, 2012, 129 min, broadcast on 26 December 2012 on France 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.operadeparis.fr/videopera/haut-vol Haut vol] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150328211844/http://www.operadeparis.fr/videopera/haut-vol |date=2015-03-28 }} interpreted by Éleonore Baulac and Allister Madin, choreography by Benjamin Millepied, film by Louis de Caunes.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=articlemartinerobert&gt;[http://www.lesechos.fr/27/12/2013/LesEchos/21593-071-ECH_pourquoi-les-ballets-de-l-opera-de-paris-font-partie-des-spectacles-favoris-des-fetes.htm Pourquoi les ballets de l'Opéra de Paris font partie des spectacles favoris des fêtes], article by Martine Robert, 27 December 2013, Les Echos.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;If you add the [[Mariinsky Ballet|St Petersburg Mariinsky Ballet]] and the [[New York City Ballet]] to the list you get the top five ballet companies in the world. &lt;!-- For general reference you may cite Philippe Noisette (Le Figaro, Les Echos, France Culture), Ariane Bavelier (Le Figaro), Alastair Macauley (The New York Times, formerly The Financial Times), Laura Capelle (Pointe magazine). --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Since August 2016 the company has been under the direction of [[Aurélie Dupont]], the "Directrice de la Danse".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.operadeparis.fr/en/news/aurelie-dupont-nouvelle-directrice-de-la-danse-de-lopera-national-de-paris Aurélie Dupont, the Paris Opera’s new Dance Director], report from the site of the Paris Opera, 1 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ballet company consists of 154 dancers, among them 17 [[Danseur Étoile|Danseurs Étoiles]]. The principal dancers give 180 dance performances each year, primarily at the [[Palais Garnier]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.operadeparis.fr/en/artists/ballet/ballet-company Paris Opera Ballet], site of the Paris Opera.&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as prestigious as the Paris Opera Ballet is its dance school, the Paris Opera Ballet School ([[French language|French]]: "École de danse de l'Opéra national de Paris"), considered as one of the world's best dance school.&lt;ref name=filmgrainesetoiles&gt;[http://www.schuchprod.com/wp-content/files_mf/revuedepressegraines.pdf Paris Opera Ballet School - a World of its Own] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303170402/http://www.schuchprod.com/wp-content/files_mf/revuedepressegraines.pdf |date=2016-03-03 }}, L'école de danse, un monde à part, review of the press of April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Its former pupils have won a record of 20 [[Prix Benois de la Danse|Benois de la Danse]] awards.

==History==
{{See also|History of ballet}}

===Naming===
The Paris Opera Ballet has always been an integral part of the [[Paris Opera]], which was founded in 1669 as the Académie d'Opéra (Academy of Opera), although theatrical dance did not become an important component of the Paris Opera until 1673, after it was renamed the Académie Royale de Musique (Royal Academy of Music) and placed under the leadership of [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]].&lt;ref name=Crane/&gt;&lt;ref name=Christout86&gt;Christout 1998, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; The Paris Opera has had many different official names during its long history but since 1994 has been called the Opéra National de Paris (Paris National Opera).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.operadeparis.fr/lopera-de-paris/histoire "Histoire de l'Opéra national de Paris"] (in French) at the Paris Opera website. Retrieved 19  July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Background===
The Paris Opera Ballet had its origins in the earlier dance institutions, traditions and practices of the court of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]. Of particular importance were the series of [[Comédie-ballet|''comédies-ballets'']] created by [[Molière]] with, among others, the choreographers and composers [[Pierre Beauchamps]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]]. The first was ''Les Fâcheux'' in 1661 and the most important, ''[[Le Bourgeois gentilhomme]]'' in 1670.&lt;ref&gt;Guest 2006, pp. 5–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these were also performed by [[Molière's company]] at the public [[Théâtre du Palais-Royal (rue Saint-Honoré)|Théâtre du Palais-Royal]] in Paris, which was later to become the first permanent home of the opera company and the opera ballet.

Also in 1661, Louis XIV had founded the [[Académie Royale de Danse]] (Royal Academy of Dance) in an effort "to improve the quality of dance instruction for court entertainments". Members of the academy, as well as the dance teachers who were certified by it, and their students, participated in the creation of the ballets for the court, Molière, and later the opera.&lt;ref&gt;Astier 1998a, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1680, Beauchamps became the chancellor (director) of the Académie Royale de Danse.&lt;ref name=Christout86/&gt;&lt;ref name=Astier396&gt;Astier 1998b, pp. 396–397.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Académie Royale de Danse and the Opera were closely connected, the two institutions remained separate, and the former disappeared with the fall of the monarchy in 1789.&lt;ref&gt;Astier 1998a, p. 4. The last list of its members was published in the 1779 ''Almanach des spectacles de Paris'' [http://www.larousse.fr/archives/danse/page/2 Archive Larousse].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Founding and early history===
On 28 June 1669, Louis XIV granted a [[Letters patent|privilege]] to the poet [[Pierre Perrin]] giving him a monopoly to form a separate academy for the performance of opera in French. The first production of the company founded by Perrin, the Académie d'Opéra (Academy of Opera),&lt;ref&gt;Also referred to as the Académie Royale des Opéra (Powell 2010, p. 178).&lt;/ref&gt; was [[Pomone (opera)|''Pomone'']], which was first performed on 3 March 1671 at the [[Jeu de Paume de la Bouteille]] and included ballets choreographed by Anthoine des Brosses.&lt;ref&gt;Powell 1995, p. 179; Guest 2006, p. 7; Powell 2010, p. 178. It is frequently stated that Beauchamps choreographed the ballets for ''Pomone'' (e.g., Astier 1998a, p. 3). According to Powell, this misunderstanding is based on the 'Recueil de Tralage' (ca. 1697; MS 6544, Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal, Paris). A manuscript legal document in the Archives of the Comédie-Française makes clear, however, that Anthoine des Brosses, who had earlier served as dancing master for the [[Théâtre du Marais]], choreographed the ballets for ''Pomone''. Beauchamps only took over des Brosses's position with Perrin's company in the late autumn or early winter of 1671, when des Brosses moved back to the Marais to choreograph [[Jean Donneau de Visé]]'s musical machine-play ''Le Mariage de Bacchus et d'Ariane'' (performed at the Théâtre du Marais in the winter of 1671–1672).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1672, Lully purchased Perrin's privilege and also obtained new letters patent limiting the use of musicians and dancers by other French companies. With Anthoine des Brosses and Lully as choreographers and [[Carlo Vigarani]] as stage designer, Lully's company, now called the Académie Royale de Musique, produced Lully's first opera, ''Les fêtes de l'Amour et de Bacchus'' (a ''pastorale'') in November 1672 at the [[Jeu de Paume de Béquet]].&lt;ref&gt;Powell 2008, pp. 127, 233 note 44; Powell 2010, p. 178; [[Jérôme de La Gorce]], "Lully's first opera. A rediscovered poster for ''Les fêtes de l'Amour et de Bacchus''", ''Early Music'', vol. 15, no. 3, Lully Anniversary Issue (Aug., 1987), pp. 308–314, {{JSTOR|3137552}}. [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k72258r.r=.langEN Libretto, 1672]; [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k109668m/f1.image.r=Les%20festes%20de%20l%27Amour%20et%20Bachus.langFR ms score from the [[Philidor Collection]], 1705].&lt;/ref&gt; This work consisted primarily of excerpts from Lully's prior court ballets connected with new ''[[Entrée (ballet)|entrées]]'' choreographed by des Brosses.&lt;ref name=Powell178&gt;Powell 2010, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; A crucial difference, however, from the previous court ballets was that the members of the court no longer participated, and all of the dancers were professionals.&lt;ref&gt;Astier 1998a, p. 3. Note however that the ''Gazette d'Amsterdam'' reports that nobles did dance in public at certain performances (cited by La Gorce 2002, pp. 189–190).&lt;/ref&gt;

Lully's next production, ''[[Cadmus et Hermione]]'' (27 April 1673), the first ''[[Tragédie en musique|tragédie lyrique]]'' (with a libretto by [[Philippe Quinault]]), also premiered at the Jeu de Paume de Béquet and was choreographed by Anthoine des Brosses.&lt;ref name=Powell178/&gt; Pierre Beauchamps, who had been working with Molière at the Palais-Royal, joined Lully's company in June 1673 (not long after Molière's death), when Lully took over the Palais-Royal theatre, forcing Molière's troupe to move to the [[Théâtre Guénégaud]]. Lully and Quinault continued to collaborate on a series of successful productions, in the process creating a new genre of French opera in which dance interludes played an important part in the musical drama.&lt;ref&gt;Christout 1998, pp. 86–87.&lt;/ref&gt; The ballets for these works were created by Beauchamps, des Brosses, and d'Olivet. [[Jean-Baptiste Dubos]] explains that Beauchamps and des Brosses were responsible for the ''ballets ordinaires'', while d'Olivet specialized in ''ballet-pantomime'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Lully paid such great attention to the ballets mentioned here that he engaged for their choreography a 'maître de danse particulier' named d'Olivet. It was he, and not des Brosses or Beauchamps, whom Lully engaged for the 'ballets ordinaires', who composed the ballets of the infernal scenes of ''[[Psyché (opera)|Psyché]]'' and ''[[Alceste (Lully)|Alceste]]''. It was also d'Olivet who composed the ballet of the old men in ''[[Thesée]]'', of the baneful dreams in ''[[Atys (Lully)|Atys]]'', and of the tremblers in ''[[Isis (Lully)|Isis]]''. This last was composed solely of pantomimic gestures by men seized with cold, and he did not introduce a single usual dance step into it.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted and translated by Powell 1995, p. 185, citing ''Réflexions critiques sur la poésie et sur la peinture'', Paris, 1719, p. 357. See [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6544468q/f265.image.r=olivet.langEN p. 247 of the ''Troisième Partie'' of the 1740 edition] at Gallica.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Initially the dancers of the Paris Opera Ballet were all male. [[De Lafontaine|Mademoiselle de la Fontaine]] (1665–1738) became the first professional [[ballerina]] when she danced in the premiere of Lully's ballet ''Le Triomphe de l'Amour'' on 21 January 1681.&lt;ref&gt;Guest 2006, p. 9; Pitou 1983, pp. 249, 325–326. [http://operabaroque.fr/LULLY_TRIOMPHE.htm ''Le Triomphe de l'Amour''] at operabaroque.fr. [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b9062398b/f4.image.r=.langEN Score of ''Le Triomphe de l'Amour''] at Gallica.&lt;/ref&gt; Pierre Beauchamps continued to collaborate with Lully at the Paris Opera until Lully's death in 1687.&lt;ref name=Astier396/&gt;

===Later history===
The 18th century saw the creation of an associated school, now referred to as the Paris Opera Ballet School ([[French language|French]]: École de Danse de l’Opéra de Paris), which opened in 1713. The operas of [[Rameau]], and later [[Gluck]], raised standards for the dancers. [[Jean-Georges Noverre]] was a particularly influential ballet master from 1776 to 1781. He created the ballet ''[[Les petits riens]]'' in 1778 on [[Mozart]]'s music. [[Maximilien Gardel]] was ballet master from 1781, with his brother [[Pierre Gardel]] taking over after Maximilien's death in 1787. Pierre Gardel survived the [[French Revolution|Revolution]] creating ballets such as ''La Marseillaise'' and ''Offrande à la Liberté''.&lt;ref name=Crane/&gt; He remained the ballet master until 1820 and continued to work up to 1829.&lt;ref name=Babsky&gt;Babsky 1998, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1820, Pierre Gardel was succeeded as ballet master by [[Jean-Louis Aumer]], who was however highly criticized for using too much mime and failing to use choreography which furthered plot or character.&lt;ref name=Babsky/&gt; In 1821, the company moved to a new house, the [[Salle Le Peletier]], where [[Romantic ballet]] was born.

In 1875, the company moved to the [[Palais Garnier]] where it continues to perform.&lt;ref name=Crane/&gt;

===Serge Lifar as ballet director===
In 1929, [[Jacques Rouché]] invited 24-year-old dancer [[Serge Lifar]] to take over the directorship of the Paris Opéra Ballet, which had fallen into decline in the late 19th century.

As [[ballet master]] from 1930 to 1944, and from 1947 to 1958, he devoted himself to the restoration of the technical level of the Opéra Ballet, returning it to its place as one of the best companies in the world.

Lifar gave the company a new strength and purpose, initiating the rebirth of ballet in France, and began to create the first of many ballets for that company.&lt;ref name="Crisp 2002 3–15"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crisp|first=Clement|title=ICARE: Remembering Serge Lifar|journal=Dance Research: The Journal of the Society for Dance Research|date=Winter 2002|volume=20|series=2|pages=3–15|doi=10.3366/1290812}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his three decades as director of the Paris Opéra Ballet, Lifar led the company through the turbulent times of [[World War II]] and the German occupation of France. Lifar brought the Paris Opéra Ballet to America and performed to full houses at the [[New York City Center]]. Audiences were enthusiastic and had great admiration for the company of dancers.&lt;ref name="Crisp 2002 3–15"/&gt;

==Era of Rudolf Nureyev==
In the world of ballet [[Rudolf Nureyev]] is regarded as the greatest classical dancer ever and as one of the most preeminent choreographers.&lt;ref name=articlephilippenoisette_2013_03_01&gt;Philippe Noisette, [http://www.lesechos.fr/01/03/2013/LesEchos/21387-438-ECH_que-reste-t-il-de-noureev--.htm « Que reste-t-il de Noureev ? »] ''[[Les Échos (newspaper)|Les Échos]]'', 1 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, Rudolf Nureyev was appointed director of the Paris Opera Ballet, where, as well as directing, he continued to dance and to promote younger dancers.

The top female ballet dancer at that time, if not of all times&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/dance/what-to-see/sylvie-guillem-the-greatest-female-dancer-i-have-ever-seen/ Sylvie Guillem: the greatest female dancer I have ever seen], article by Sarah Crampton, 4 November 2014, The Telegraph.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/dance/sylvie-guillem-life-in-progress--the-greatest-dancer-of-our-time-calls-it-quits-20150810-givh00.html Sylvie Guillem: Life in Progress - the greatest dancer of our time calls it quits], article by Nick Miller, 1 August 2015, The Sydney Morning Herald.&lt;/ref&gt;  was [[Sylvie Guillem]] who was nominated principal dancer at the age of 19 by Rudolf Nureyev in 1984. They were a mythical dance couple.&lt;ref name=profilcultureshow&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsXXycSjgcs « ''Sylvie Guillem:Force of Nature'' »], ''[[The Culture Show]]'', [[BBC Two]], 9 octobre 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The years of Nureyev marked a golden era of the Paris Opera Ballet.&lt;ref name=articlephilippenoisette_2013_03_01/&gt;

==Brigitte Lefèvre==
[[Brigitte Lefèvre]], director from 1995 to 2014, with Patrice Bart as maitre de ballet from 1990 to 2011, succeeded to maintain the high standard that Nureyev has set.

Brigitte Lefèvre invited some of the most preeminent choreographers such as [[William Forsythe (dancer)|William Forsythe]], [[Angelin Preljocaj]], [[Saburo Teshigawara]], and [[John Neumeier]].&lt;ref name=inter&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franceinter.fr/personne-brigitte-lefevre|title=Brigitte Lefèvre|publisher=France Inter|accessdate=18 March 2014 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transition==
There have been turbulent times of the company with [[Benjamin Millepied]], director of the Paris Opera Ballet from Novembre 2014 on who quit on 15 July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/11/arts/dance/benjamin-millepied-opens-up-on-leaving-paris-opera-ballet.html Benjamin Millepied Opens Up on Leaving Paris Opera Ballet], article by Roslyn Sulcas, 10 February 2016, The New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were two stumbling blocks with Millepied, a French dancer and choreographer, who left France in 1993 at the age of 16, got his main professional education as a dancer and  choreographer in the United States and came back to France in 2014 as newly-appointed director of the Paris Opera Ballet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.liberation.fr/culture/0101599511-les-mille-et-une-vies-de-benjamin-millepied | title = ''Les mille et une vies de Benjamin Millepied'' (The Many Lives of Benjamin Millepied) |work=Libération |language=French | author = Vernay, Marie-Christine | date = 27 October 2009}} ([https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=fr&amp;u=http://www.liberation.fr/culture/0101599511-les-mille-et-une-vies-de-benjamin-millepied English translation via Google])&lt;/ref&gt;

The one was that Millepied wanted the Paris Opera Ballet dancers to interpret La Bayadère, a classic ballet choreographed by Rudolf Nureyew in 1993, like a contemporary ballet.&lt;ref name=millepiedsexitarticlelemonde&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/culture/article/2016/02/04/benjamin-millepied-va-t-il-quitter-l-opera-de-paris_4858949_3246.html Benjamin Millepied démissionne de ses fonctions de directeur de la danse à l’Opéra de Paris], article and interview by Rosita Boiseau, 4 February 2016, [[Le Monde]].&lt;/ref&gt; To achieve this goal he has already hired guest principal dancers to present La Bayadère.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lefigaro.fr/theatre/2015/12/17/03003-20151217ARTFIG00225-benjamin-millepied-le-ballet-doit-sortir-de-sa-bulle.php Départ surprise de Benjamin Millepied: les sujets qui fâchent], interview of Benjamin Millepied by Ariane Bavélier, 17 December 2015, [[Le Figaro]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The other stumbling block was that Millepied has actually broken the hierarchy with the "Danseurs Étoiles" dancing the leading roles as he has chosen for the cast of his first contemporary ballet creation "Clear, Loud, Bright, Forward" (the first one in his time as director) out of the 154 danseurs a "dream team" of 16 dancers which he considered to be the fittest to put to practice his ideas and visions (on the programming the dream team was named "United visual artists").&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Millepied explained his ideas in a documentary "Relève" which could be watched in a preview on 25 November 2015 and broadcast regularly on Canal+ on 23 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GydXpJ44RNU Relève, le documentaire sur le ballet de Benjamin Millepied - Bande annonce CANAL+], 1:07 min&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canalplus.fr/c-infos-documentaires/pid8295-releve-millepied.html documentary "Relève"], site of canal+.&lt;/ref&gt;
Karl Paquette, principal dancer, said in an interview that he didn't feel so badly since 6 months. Stéphane Bullion, principal dancer, added that it was clear that things could not be straightened out.&lt;ref name=millepiedsexitarticlelemonde/&gt;

[[Stéphane Lissner]], the Paris Opera director who hired Benjamin Millepied in January 2013 — and who has final authority on decisions about budget, hiring and promotion — said at a news conference at the Palais Garnier on Thursday 4 February 2016 that he had no regrets about that choice.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/05/arts/dance/benjamin-millepied-paris-opera.html Benjamin Millepied to Step Down From Paris Opera Ballet], article by Roslyn Sulcas, 4 February 2016, ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

“He leaves too soon, but others leave too late.” Lissner added, “I think that the two jobs, director of dance and a choreographer who is more and more in demand, not just at the Opera, raised a certain number of questions.”

==Aurélie Dupont==
[[Aurélie Dupont]] took over the direction of the ballet company on 1 August 2016.

Aurélie Dupont was Danseuse Étoile from 1994 to 2015. Aurelie Dupont was the inspiration behind the Cédric Klapisch film about the star,&lt;ref&gt;In 2010, [[Cédric Klapisch]] released a documentary about Dupont, ''L'espace d'un instant'', which had been made over the previous two years. See {{IMDb title|1611812|L'espace d'un instant}}.&lt;/ref&gt; considered the grande dame of the Paris Opera Ballet.

==Hierarchy==
The hierarchy of the Paris Opera Ballet is very strict. For a dancer it is virtually compulsory to enter first the Paris Opera Ballet School. "You cannot get into the company if you have not done the school" ([[Mathilde Froustey]]&lt;ref name=interviewmathildefrousteyjan2014/&gt;). The competition for admission to both institutions is extremely fierce as well as the competition for the highest ranks in the ballet company.

More than 90 percent of the candidates don't pass the Ballet School entrance examination, 20 percent of its pupils have to leave at the end of the year failing in the annual competitive examinations ("les concours annuels") in May.&lt;ref name=filmgrainesetoiles/&gt; Only 5 to 20 percent of the Ballet School graduates are accepted in the Paris Opera Ballet, initially as dancers on trial (the "stagiares")&lt;ref&gt;"Graines des étoiles", documentary film by Françoise Marie from 2013, was broadcast starting on 2 February 2013 on France 3, 156 min, six episodes of 26 min.&lt;/ref&gt;

To become a regular member of the Paris Opera Ballet as "Quadrille" (fifth and lowest rank in the hierarchy) you have to pass the annual competitive examination in November. Promotion to the next rank depends exclusively on success in the following annual competitive examinations ("les concours internes de promotion") in front of a board of judges. To achieve the highest rank as Danseur Étoile (only by nomination) you have to perform in leading roles as "Premier Danseur" for many years before you are nominated due to outstanding excellence and merit.&lt;ref name=ladanse&gt;[[La Danse (film)|La Danse]], film by [[Frederick Wiseman]], 2009, 159 min.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Small scandals and the lost generation==
As the Paris Opera Ballet has a large quantity of first-class French dancers there are hard times for those who have not been promoted to the highest ranks as dancers or have not been appointed afterwards for positions for which they would have been extremely qualified.&lt;ref name=laurahecquetfinallyprincipaldancer/&gt;

[[Mathilde Froustey]], Sujet from 2005 till 2013 left the Paris Opera Ballet in July 2013 and joined the San Francisco Ballet as a principal dancer because there was no chance for her becoming eventually Danseuse étoile (principal dancer) in this company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dansesaveclaplume.com/pas-de-deux/laura-hecquet-avoir-des-responsabilites-est-quelque-chose-qui-me-plait/ Laura Hecquet : « Avoir des responsabilités est quelque chose qui me plait »], article by Amélie Bertrand, 27 March 2015, extract: "Quand je suis rentrée à l'École, j'ai tout de suite beaucoup apprécié cette danseuse. Avoir Mathilde Froustey dans votre classe vous tire vers le haut. ... Nous sommes rentrées ensemble dans la compagnie. Nous avons été poussées très vite toutes les deux, avant de nous retrouver bloquées dans la classe des Sujets. Je crois que nous l'avons vécu de la même manière, même si Mathilde a dansé un peu plus que moi des premiers rôles. On ne comprenait pas pourquoi nous étions bloquées. Sans forcément que l'on en parle, ce sentiment nous a unies et nous a donné énormément de force. ... Mathilde Froustey a continué, mais ça ne marchait pas mieux pour elle, ça ne décollait pas non plus. Elle a pris cette décision de partir. J'ai trouvé qu'elle avait eu beaucoup de courage d'aller tenter sa chance ailleurs." (Laura Hecquet).&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2014 [[Benjamin Millepied]], a former principal dancer of the New York City Ballet and French, took over the direction of the company and promised a change: "They asked for a change and they will get a change."&lt;ref&gt;[http://madame.lefigaro.fr/celebrites/benjamin-millepied-variation-libre-300115-94145 Benjamin Millepied fait souffler un vent nouveau sur l'Opéra], interview of Benjamin Millepied by Élisabeth Quinn on [[Madame Figaro]] 6 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; When  Benjamin Millepied nominated for the first (and only) time a "Danseuse étoile", Laura Hecquet was chosen. Laura Hecquet and Mathilde Froustey were described in the press as "the lost generation" of dancers working up the ranks who have become soloist (Sujet) but have been unlucky for years as far as climbing up the last step of the career ladder is concerned.&lt;ref name=laurahecquetfinallyprincipaldancer&gt;[http://www.dansesaveclaplume.com/en-coulisse/laura-hecquet-nommee-danseuse-etoile/ Laura Hecquet nominated Principle Dancer], article "Laura Hecquet nommée Danseuse Étoile" by Aurélie Bertrand, 27 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pointemagazine.com/inside-pt/truly-exceptional/ Truly Exceptional - Our Top 12 Standout Performances of 2015], review containing a paragraph on Laura Hecquet by Laura Capelle, [[Pointe (magazine)|Pointe]], extract: "Like her classmate, San Francisco Ballet principal Mathilde Froustey, Hecquet was pegged as a future star when she graduated from the POB School in 2002. A decade as a sujet and a serious knee injury later, it seemed like the company would never give her the opportunity to prove herself.".&lt;/ref&gt;

The Paris Opera Ballet School has churned out some of the most famous dancers of all time, such as [[Sylvie Guillem]] and [[Laurent Hilaire]].&lt;ref name=interviewmathildefrousteyjan2014/&gt;

Yet Sylvie Guillem, being principal dancer since 1984, left the company in 1989 at the age of 24 because she wanted more freedom, the right to perform with other companies, an arrangement the management of the Paris Opera Ballet declined.&lt;ref name=profilcultureshow/&gt;

Laurent Hilaire was highly appreciated as principal dancer. After his farewell as a dancer he continued his career in the company attaining in 2011 the second-highest position as "Maitre de ballet associated to the direction". Laurent Hilaire was the favourite of Brigitte Lefèvre, director of the ballet, and [[Nicolas Joel]], director of the Paris Opera at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.revistadadanca.com/?p=922 Brigitte Lefèvre quittera le ballet de l'opéra de Paris en 2014], 29 September 2012, Revista da danca.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2013 Stéphane Lissner the new director of the Paris Opera (in the hierarchy above the Paris Opera Ballet's director) appointed Benjamin Millepied. Hilaire announced in May 2014 his departure and quit the company in July. The Paris Opera Ballet's new director Benjamin Millepied on his part stayed only two seasons and was followed in August by [[Aurélie Dupont]], who was as Danseuse Ètoile the Grand-dame of the Paris Opera Ballet.

[[François Alu]], Premier Danseur since 2013 and 23 years old, is regarded for his technique particularly stunning jumps and dazzling pirouettes and his dance style as the next principal dancer to be nominated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parismatch.com/Culture/Spectacles/Francois-Alu-mene-la-danse-Opera-de-Paris-678160 Opéra de Paris: François Alu mène la danse], article by Philippe Noisette, 29 December 2015, Paris Match.&lt;/ref&gt; Now, this isn't amazing news, well-known for at least two years. François Alu was called by the critic Laura Capelle in her review of 10 January 2013 for DanceTabs as "Wunderkind" (child prodigy).&lt;ref&gt;[http://dancetabs.com/2013/01/paris-opera-ballet-don-quixote-paris/ Paris Opera Ballet – Don Quixote – Paris]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sylvie Guillem who was nominated Danseuse Étoile even at the age of 19 by Rudolf Nureyev, director of that time, told about Nureyev that he was excellent in this regard&lt;ref name=profilcultureshow/&gt; thinking of him great anyway. Rudolf Nureyev once said in an interview on Sylvie Guillem: She is so young and she wants to become like me.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20141106000780 Last dance for bold ballerina Sylvie Guillem] [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]], The Korea Herald, 6 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paris Opera Ballet School==
The Paris Opera Ballet School ([[French language|French]]: "École de danse de l'Opéra national de Paris") is one of the most preeminent in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.operadeparis.fr/en/artists/ballet-school/history The Ballet School], site of the Paris Opera.&lt;/ref&gt; It has six classes for boys and girls separately named "sixième division" to "première division". In 1987, the Paris Opera Ballet School moved from the [[Palais Garnier]] where most of the Paris Opera ballets take place to a new building located 10 kilometres west of the centre of Paris in [[Nanterre]]. The new dance school building was designed by [[Christian de Portzamparc]]. Since 1995 the Paris Opera Ballet School has been a boarding school,&lt;ref&gt;Between 1987 and 1995 the Paris Opera Ballet School was a boarding school as well, but obtaining the bac was not compulsory.&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, from 8 till noon, all pupils attend school classes leading to the obtention of the French "baccalauréat (the bac)", the general qualification for university entrance in France.

Among the dancers of the Paris Opera Ballet, 95 percent have attended the Paris Opera Ballet School.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lesechos.fr/27/12/2013/LesEchos/21593-071-ECH_pourquoi-les-ballets-de-l-opera-de-paris-font-partie-des-spectacles-favoris-des-fetes.htm Pourquoi les ballets de l'Opéra de Paris font partie des spectacles favoris des fêtes], article by Martine Robert, 27 December 2013, Les Echos&lt;/ref&gt; To describe it differently, for a young dancer to be accepted in the Paris Opera [[Corps de ballet]] it is virtually obligatory to enter the Paris Opera Ballet School and attend at least the final two classes (deuxième et première division). More than 90 percent of the candidates do not pass the entrance examination.&lt;ref&gt;The first entrance examination is a physical test, the second one an audition&lt;/ref&gt; Even some of the dancers who have later become premiers danseurs (first soloists) or [[Danseur Étoile|danseurs étoiles]] ([[principal dancer]]s) of the Paris Opera Ballet passed the entrance examination only on the second attempt or were accepted only as fee-paying pupils.&lt;ref&gt;For example Laura Hecquet and Léonore Baulac, who passed only on the second attempt, or Mathias Heymann, who was accepted only as a fee-paying pupil.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4100">'''Petro Yefymenko''' [or '''Jefymenko''' [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]: Петро Єфименко, pseud. Petro Odynets], (2 September 1835, [[Velykyi Tokmak]], [[Berdiansk]] county, [[Ukraine]] – 7 May 1908, [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]]) was a Ukrainian [[Ethnography|ethnographer]] and [[historian]], statistician by profession.

== Life and Work ==
Petro Yefymenko studied at [[Kharkiv University]] until his expulsion (1855-1858) and [[Moscow State University|Moscow University]] (1858–1859). As a student, he belonged to secret student societies, including Kharkiv-Kyiv Secret Society (1856-1860).&lt;ref&gt;“Kharkiv-Kyiv Secret Society” 1989, [http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CK%5CH%5CKharkiv6KyivSecretSociety.htm ''Internet Encyclopedia of Ukraine'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1860 Petro Yefymenko was accused of Ukrainian separatism. He was arrested and exiled for 10 years to [[Perm]] and then [[Arkhangelsk]], Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Holobutskyi, P. 2005, “Yefymenko Petro Savych”, '[http://resource.history.org.ua/cgi-bin/eiu/history.exe?&amp;I21DBN=EIU&amp;P21DBN=EIU&amp;S21STN=1&amp;S21REF=10&amp;S21FMT=eiu_all&amp;C21COM=S&amp;S21CNR=20&amp;S21P01=0&amp;S21P02=0&amp;S21P03=TRN=&amp;S21COLORTERMS=0&amp;S21STR=Efymenko_P_S ''Entsyklopedia Istorii Ukrainy''] [Encyclopedia of History of Ukraine], Naukova Dumka, Kyiv&lt;/ref&gt; During his exile, Petro Yefymenko collected materials on the local ethnography, folklore and law. His publications on this topic include: ''Pridanoe po obychnomu pravu krestyan v Arkhangelskoi Gubernii'' [Dowry according to the customery law of the peasants of [[Arkhangelsk]] governorate], [[Saint Petersburg|Saint Peteresburg]], 1873.

Petro Yefymenko returned to Ukraine in 1877, firstly to [[Chernihiv]] and then, two years later, to [[Kharkiv]]. He devoted himself to ethnographic and historical research and writings. Significant part of his work consisted of traveling throughout Ukraine gathering relevant materials. In 1884–1888 he worked as editor of '''''Kharkovskyi kalendar''''' [Kharkiv calendar], where he started publishing works of another famous Ukrainian ethnographer [[Pavlo Chubynsky]], as well as bibliography of [[Pavlo Chubynsky|Chubynsky’s]] works.&lt;ref&gt;Katchanovski, E. (ed.) 2013, ''Historical Dictionary of Ukraine'', 2nd ed. The Scacrow Press, Lantham, p.77]&lt;/ref&gt; Petro Efymenko’s works were published in a number periodicals, including: '''''Osnova''''', Russia; weekly newspaper '''''Chernigovskii Listok''''', Ukraine (founded and edited by [[Leonid Hlibov]]); and '''''[[Kievskaya starina]]''''' [Kyivan antiquity], Ukraine.

Reverend Father '''Raoul Desribes''' (born in 1856, died in 1940) was a French [[Jesuit]] [[Archaeology|archaeologist]] notable for his work on [[prehistory]] in [[Lebanon]], particularly the archaeological site of [[Minet Dalieh]] at [[Ras Beirut]]. He found two [[paleolithic]] bone [[harpoon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Desribes, Raoul., "Harpons trouvés dans la brèche paléolithique d'Antélias", ''L'Anthropologie'', 25, 213, 1914&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ricardo Almendáriz''' ({{floruit|1787}}) was a [[Guatemala]]n draftsman who accompanied [[Antonio del Río]] to the first excavation of [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mayan civilization|Maya]] ruins at [[Palenque]] in [[Chiapas]], [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name=Stuart2007:154&gt;Stuart 2007: 154&lt;/ref&gt;  Undertaken in May and June 1787, the expedition was performed under orders from [[Charles III of Spain]] to investigate reports about the ruins from the inhabitants of the neighboring pueblo of [[Santo Domingo de Palenque]].&lt;ref name=Stuart2007:154 /&gt;  The team spent two weeks digging at the location followed by three weeks studying the site.&lt;ref name="loc"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/earlyamericas/online/precontact/precontact4.html|title=Eighteenth-Century Drawings of Palenque|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=2009-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almendáriz made thirty drawings of the [[bas relief]] sculptures at the Palenque ruins.&lt;ref name=Stuart2007:154 /&gt;  These drawings were intended to accompany del Río's written report, which was dated June 24, 1787.&lt;ref name=Stuart2007:154 /&gt;  According to George Stuart, writing for the [[Kislak Foundation]], the del Río report "ranks as the first substantial archaeological report known in the Americas."&lt;ref name=stuart2007:156&gt;Stuart 2007: 156&lt;/ref&gt; Almendáriz's drawings of Palenque are "remarkably accurate for the era" and depict features of Palenque that have since been destroyed from exposure. For this reason they remain scientifically useful.&lt;ref name=stuart2007:156/&gt;

The Almendáriz drawings were copied for archival purposes.&lt;ref name=stuart2007:156/&gt; The most complete set of contemporary copies belongs to the library of the Royal Palace in [[Madrid]].&lt;ref name=stuart2007:156/&gt;

'''Rigoberta Menchú Tum''' ({{IPA-es|riɣoˈβeɾta menˈtʃu|lang}}; born 9 January 1959) is a [[K'iche' people|K'iche']] [[political activist|political]] and [[human rights defender|human rights activist]] from [[Guatemala]]. Menchú has dedicated her life to publicizing the rights of Guatemala's indigenous feminists during and after the [[Guatemalan Civil War]] (1960–1996), and to promoting [[indigenous rights]] in the country.

She received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1992 and the [[Prince of Asturias Award]] in 1998. She is the subject of the testimonial biography ''I, Rigoberta Menchú'' (1983) and the author of the autobiographical work, ''Crossing Borders''. Menchú is a [[UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador]]. She has also become a figure in indigenous political parties and ran for [[President of Guatemala]] in 2007 and 2011.

==Personal life==
Rigoberta Menchú was born to a poor indigenous family of K'iche' Maya descent in [[Laj Chimel]], a peasant hamlet in the north-central Guatemalan province of [[Quiché Department|El Quiché]]. Menchú received a primary- and middle-school education as a student at several Catholic boarding schools. In 1981, Menchú was exiled and escaped to Mexico. She found refuge in the home of a Catholic bishop in Chiapas. In 1995, Menchú married Ángel Canil, a Guatemalan. They have a son, Mash Nahual J’a ("Spirit of Water").&lt;ref&gt;Irwin Abrams, ''The Nobel Peace Prize and the Laureates: An Illustrated Biographical History'', Watson Publishing International, 2001, p. 296.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==
{{more citations needed|section|date=January 2017}}
After leaving school, Menchú worked as an activist campaigning against [[human rights]] violations committed by the [[Guatemalan armed forces]] during the country's civil war, which lasted from 1960 to 1996. In 1979-80 her brother Patrocinio and her mother Juana were kidnapped, tortured and murdered by the Guatemalan army. Her father Vicente died in the 1980 [[Burning of the Spanish Embassy]], which occurred after urban guerrillas took hostages and were attacked by government security forces. In 1984 her brother Victor was shot to death after he surrendered to the army, was threatened by soldiers, and tried to escape.

While in exile in Mexico, Menchú continued to organize resistance to oppression in Guatemala and the struggle for indigenous rights by co-founding the United Republic of Guatemalan Opposition. Tens of thousands of people, mostly Mayan Indians, fled to Mexico from 1982 to 1984 at the height of Guatemala's 36-year civil war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/3b72550b2a.html|title=Menchú Tum, Rigoberta|publisher=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|website=UNHCR|accessdate=14 May 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604184728/http://www.unhcr.org/3b72550b2a.html|archivedate=4 June 2016|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, she narrated a book about her life, titled ''Me llamo Rigoberta Menchú y así me nació la conciencia'' (''My Name is Rigoberta Menchú, and this is how my Conscience was Born'') to Venezuelan author and anthropologist [[Elizabeth Burgos]], which was translated into five other languages including English and French. The book made her an international icon at the time of the ongoing conflict in Guatemala.&lt;ref name=nobel/&gt;

Since the [[Guatemalan Civil War]] ended, Menchú has campaigned to have Guatemalan political and military establishment members tried in Spanish courts. In 1999 she filed a complaint before a court in Spain because prosecutions of crimes committed during the civil war are practically impossible in Guatemala. These attempts stalled as the Spanish courts determined that the plaintiffs had not yet exhausted all possibility of seeking justice through the legal system of Guatemala.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/dec/03/news/mn-40132|title=Activist Asks Spain to Pursue Guatemala Case|last=Reuters|first=From|date=1999-12-03|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-10-04|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 23, 2006, Spain called for the [[extradition]] from Guatemala of seven former members of Guatemala's government on charges of [[genocide]] and [[torture]]. These include former military rulers [[Efraín Ríos Montt]] and [[Óscar Humberto Mejía Victores|Óscar Mejía]]. Spain's highest court ruled that cases of genocide committed abroad could be judged in Spain, even if no Spanish citizens were involved. In addition to the deaths of Spanish citizens, the most serious charges include genocide against the [[Maya people]] of Guatemala.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6205327.stm|title=Spain seeks Guatemalan ex-rulers|date=23 December 2006|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, a Guatemalan court convicted the commander of a former police investigations unit of murder, attempted murder and crimes against humanity for his role in the embassy attack, in which Menchú's father died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Grandin|first=Greg|title=Rigoberta Menchú Vindicated|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/rigoberta-menchu-vindicated/#|work=The Nation|accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Menchú has become involved in the Indian [[pharmaceutical]] industry as president of "[[Salud para Todos]]" ("Health for All") and the company "Farmacias Similares," with the goal of offering low-cost [[generic medicine]]s.&lt;ref name=all&gt;[https://www.thefreelibrary.com/GUATEMALA%3A+RIGOBERTA+MENCHU+STEPS+BEYOND+TRADITION+TO+MOVE+INDIGENOUS...-a0113428762 GUATEMALA: RIGOBERTA MENCHU STEPS BEYOND TRADITION TO MOVE INDIGENOUS AGENDA], thefreelibrary.com.

In 2006, Menchú was one of the founders of the [[Nobel Women's Initiative]] along with sister Nobel Peace Laureates [[Jody Williams]], [[Shirin Ebadi]], [[Wangari Maathai]], [[Betty Williams (Nobel laureate)|Betty Williams]] and [[Mairead Corrigan Maguire]]. Six women representing North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa decided to bring together their experiences in a united effort for peace, justice and equality. It is the goal of the Nobel Women's Initiative to help strengthen [[women's rights]] around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nobelwomensinitiative.org/index.php/content/view/7/3/ Nobel Women's Initiative]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516213721/http://www.nobelwomensinitiative.org/index.php/content/view/7/3|date=16 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Menchú is a member of [[PeaceJam]], an organization whose mission is ''"to create young leaders committed to positive change in themselves, their communities and the world through the inspiration of Nobel Peace Laureates who pass on the spirit, skills, and wisdom they embody."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150420006366/en/Nobel-Peace-Prize-Winner-Rigoberta%C2%A0Mench%C3%BA%C2%A0and-Google-Volunteers#.VfoZ2flVhBc Profile], BusinessWire.com, 20 April 2015.

===Politics===
On February 12, 2007, Menchú announced that she would form an indigenous political party called [[Encuentro por Guatemala]] and that she would stand in the [[Guatemalan general election, 2007|2007 presidential election]]. Had she been elected, she would have become Latin America's fourth indigenous president after Mexico's [[Benito Juárez]], Peru's [[Alejandro Toledo]] and Bolivia's [[Evo Morales]].

In the election, Menchú was defeated in the first round, receiving three percent of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/411749/984734|title=Nobel winner seeks presidency|publisher=Tvnz.co.nz|date=10 February 2007|accessdate=22 April 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208143456/http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/411749/984734|archivedate=8 February 2009|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the elections, Rigoberta Menchú gave a message of peace to all Guatemalans on television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=//www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QkRAYa7R8M|title=Rigoberta Menchu send a Christmas and Peace message|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 she was involved in the newly founded party [[Winaq]]. Menchú was a candidate for the [[Guatemalan general election, 2011|2011 presidential election]], but lost in the first round, winning three percent of the vote again.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/columency/menchu_rigoberta/0?institutionId=702|title=Menchú, Rigoberta {{!}} The Columbia Encyclopedia - Credo Reference|website=search.credoreference.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies about her testimony==
More than a decade after the publication of ''I, Rigoberta Menchú'', anthropologist [[David Stoll]] investigated Menchú's story, researching government documents, reports, and land claims (many filed by Menchú's own family), and interviewing former neighbors, locals, friends, enemies, and others for his 1999 book ''Rigoberta Menchú and the Story of All Poor Guatemalans''.

Stoll claimed Menchú changed some elements of her life, family and village to meet the publicity needs of the guerrilla movement, which she joined as a political ''comadre'' after her parents were assassinated. The controversy caused by Stoll's book received widespread coverage in the US press of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Rohter|first=Larry|title=TARNISHED LAUREATE: A special report; Nobel Winner Finds Her Story Challenged|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=15 December 1998|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/15/world/tarnished-laureate-a-special-report-nobel-winner-finds-her-story-challenged.html?scp=7&amp;sq=rigoberta%20menchu&amp;st=cse&amp;pagewanted=1|accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Greg Grandin]] claims Stoll's research on the [[Guatemalan revolution]] is mostly wrong, but states that "two of Stoll's charges concerning Menchú's life do have merit".&lt;ref name="Grandin It Was Heaven 3"&gt;Grandin, Greg. [http://www.thenation.com/article/154582/it-was-heaven-they-burned?page=0,3 "It Was Heaven That They Burned"], ''[[The Nation]]'', 8 September 2010, pg. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; First, he documents that she received some education, contradicting a claim that her father refused to send her to school because he did not want her to lose her cultural identity. Second, Stoll presents evidence that Menchú falsely placed herself at the scene of her 16-year-old brother's murder.&lt;ref name="Grandin It Was Heaven"&gt;Grandin, Greg. [http://www.thenation.com/article/154582/it-was-heaven-they-burned?page=0,3 "It Was Heaven That They Burned"], ''[[The Nation]]'', 8 September 2010. Retrieved 27 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Grandin, Stoll in a later interview agreed to the "essential factuality of Menchú's account of how her brother and mother died".&lt;ref name="Grandin It Was Heaven 3"/&gt;

In her own critique of Stoll's work, titled ''The Silencing of Maya Women from Mama Maquin to Rigoberta Menchu'', anthropologist Victoria Sanford highlights inaccuracies in Stoll's book, and claims that he used highly questionable sources as research informants.&lt;ref&gt;Sanford, Victoria PhD. "The Silencing of Maya Women From Mama Maquin to Rigoberta Menchu", pp. 135-43; see p. 142 for critique on Stoll's informant, Alfonso Riviera.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nobel Committee dismissed calls to revoke her Nobel Prize, rejecting the claims of falsification by Stoll. [[Geir Lundestad]], the secretary of the Committee, said her prize ''"''was not based exclusively or primarily on the autobiography''"''.&lt;ref name=nobel&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/peace/laureates/1992/tum-bio.html|title=Rigoberta Menchú Tum - Biographical|publisher=Nobelprize.org|year=2013|accessdate=16 September 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829175739/http://nobelprize.org/peace/laureates/1992/tum-bio.html|archivedate=29 August 2008|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Nobel Committee,''"''Stoll approves of her Nobel prize and has no question about the picture of army atrocities which she presents. He says that her purpose in telling her story the way she did 'enabled her to focus international condemnation on an institution that deserved it, the Guatemalan army''."''&lt;ref name=nobel/&gt;

==Biography==

The brother of [[Joseph Reinach]] and [[Théodore Reinach]], he was born at [[St Germain-en-Laye]] and educated at the [[École normale supérieure]] before joining the [[École française d'Athènes|French school at Athens]] in 1879.  He made valuable archaeological discoveries at [[Myrina (Mysia)|Myrina]] near [[İzmir|Smyrna]] in 1880-82, at [[Cyme (Aeolis)|Cyme]] in 1881, at [[Thasos]], [[Imbros]] and [[Lesbos Island|Lesbos]] (1882), at [[Carthage]] and [[Meninx]] (1883–84), at [[Odessa]] (1893) and elsewhere. He received honours from the chief learned societies of Europe.

In 1887 he obtained an appointment at the National Museum of Antiquities at [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]]; in 1893 he became assistant curator, and in 1902 curator of the national museums. In 1903 he became joint editor of the "''Revue archéologique''", and in the same year officer of the [[Legion of Honour]]. The lectures he delivered on art at the [[École du Louvre]] in 1902-3 were published by him under the title of "''[https://archive.org/details/apollohistoireg00reinuoft Apollo : histoire générale des arts plastiques professée en 1902-1903 à l'École du Louvre]''". These were translated into most European languages, and became a standard handbook on the subject.

==Publications==

Reinach's first published work was a translation of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s "Essay on Free Will" ("''Essai sur le libre arbitre''", 1877), which passed through many editions. His "''Manuel de philologie classique''" (1880-1884) was crowned by the French association for the study of Greek; his "''Grammaire latine''" (1886) received a prize from the Society of Secondary Education; "''La Nécropole de Myrina''" (1887), written with [[Edmond Pottier]], and "''Antiquités nationales''" were crowned by the Academy of Inscriptions.  He compiled an important "''Répertoire de la statuaire grecque et romaine''" (3 volumes, 1897–98); also "''Répertoire de peintures du Moyen âge et de la Renaissance 1280-1580''" (1905, etc.); "''Répertoire des vases peints grecs et étrusques''" (1900). In 1905 he began his "''Cultes, mythes et religions''"; and in 1909 he published a general sketch of the history of religions under the title of "''Orpheus; histoire générale des religions''" (translated into English and published as "Orpheus, a general history of religions"). 

He also translated from the English [[Henry Charles Lea|HC Lea]]'s "History of the Inquisition" as "''Histoire de l'Inquisition au Moyen-âge''". In 1936 his updated bibliography was published &amp;mdash; "''Bibliographie de Salomon Reinach''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/bibliographie-de-salomon-reinach/oclc/4112221 Bibliographie de Salomon Reinach] OCLC WorldCat&lt;/ref&gt; It has been said his [[bibliography]] runs to 262 pages and includes more than ninety lengthy works and at least seven thousand articles. (Curtis, 2003) &lt;ref&gt;Curtis, Gregory. (2003). ''Disarmed: The Story of the Venus de Milo'', Alfred A. Knopf. p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythicist theories==

Reinach has been cited as a proponent of the [[Christ myth theory]]. However, he did not deny the possibility of an historical [[Jesus]]. Reinach is quoted as saying "It is impossible to establish the historical Jesus, which is not to say that he did not exist, but only that we cannot positively affirm anything about him."&lt;ref&gt;Cary, Phillip; Phelizon, Jean-Francois. (2015). ''Does God Have a Strategy?: A Dialogue''. Wipf and Stock Publishers. p. 144. {{ISBN|978-1-4982-2395-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reinach was critical of the [[Passion of Jesus]] which he considered was a myth based on pre-existing [[pagan]] legends.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vilfredo Pareto|Pareto, Vilfredo]]. (1935 edition). ''The Mind and Society''. ''Volume 1''. New York: Harcourt, Brace and Company. p. 451&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fawcett, Thomas. (1973). ''Hebrew myth and Christian Gospel''. S.C.M. Press. p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; Reinach was supportive of the mythicist research of [[William Benjamin Smith]]. In regard to Smith's ''Ecce Deus'', he wrote that "I have read this great book from cover to cover. It is a possession for ever. The author may not live to see it, but it will be read by myriads and shed light on millions."&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Albert Watts|Watts, Charles Albert]]. (1913). ''The R.P.A. Annual and Ethical Review''. C. A. Watts. p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

Rationalist writer [[Joseph McCabe]] wrote that Reinach was "one of the leading French authorities on the science of religion, from which he removes all supernatural elements."&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph McCabe|McCabe, Joseph]]. (1920). [https://archive.org/stream/biographicaldict00mccarich#page/n357/mode/2up ''Salomon Reinach'']. In ''A Biographical Dictionary of Modern Rationalists''. Watts &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==

Salomon Reinach died in 1932 and was buried in the [[Cimetière de Montmartre]] in the [[Montmartre Quarter]] of Paris.

{{nihongo|'''Takahito, Prince Mikasa'''|三笠宮崇仁親王|Mikasa-no-miya Takahito Shinnō|extra= 2 December 1915 – 27 October 2016}} was a Japanese royal, member of the [[Imperial House of Japan]]. He was the fourth and youngest son of [[Emperor Taishō]] and [[Empress Teimei]] and was their last surviving child, the last surviving paternal uncle of [[Akihito|Emperor Akihito]]. His eldest brother was [[Hirohito|Emperor Shōwa]] (Hirohito). After serving as a junior cavalry officer in the [[Japanese Imperial Army]] during [[World War II]], the prince embarked upon a post-war career as a scholar and part-time lecturer in [[Middle Eastern studies]] and [[Semitic languages]].

With the death of his sister-in-law, [[Kikuko, Princess Takamatsu]], on 17 December 2004, he became the oldest living member of the Imperial House of Japan. As a [[centenarian]], Prince Takahito was the [[List of centenarians (royalty and nobility)|oldest living royal]], the oldest living prince in line of succession,&lt;ref name="age100"&gt;{{cite news |title = Prince Mikasa, Emperor Akihito’s uncle, turns 100 |url = http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/12/02/national/prince-mikasa-emperor-akihitos-uncle-turns-100/#.Vl4_alkjqGl|accessdate = 2 December 2015 |newspaper = The Japan Times|date = 2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also the last one in it.  He died at age 100 on 27 October 2016 of [[cardiac arrest]] after being hospitalized for [[pneumonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Prince Mikasa, a China war veteran who spanned three reigns, dies at 100 |url = http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/10/27/national/prince-mikasa-china-war-veteran-spanned-three-reigns-dies-100/#.WBFJS-ErKCQ|work= The Japan Times|date= 27 October 2016 |accessdate = 27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kaneko |first=Kaori |url = https://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-royals-prince-misaka-idUSKCN12R07B |title=Japan's Prince Mikasa, oldest imperial family member, dies at 100|publisher=[[Reuters]]|date=27 October 2016 |accessdate=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
[[File:Emperor Taisho's sons 1921.jpg|upright|left|thumb|[[Emperor Taishō]]'s four sons in 1921: [[Hirohito]], Takahito, [[Nobuhito, Prince Takamatsu|Nobuhito]] and [[Yasuhito, Prince Chichibu|Yasuhito]]]]

Prince Takahito was born at the [[Tokyo Imperial Palace]], in the third year of his father's reign and a full fifteen years after the birth of the future Emperor Shōwa. His childhood appellation was ''Sumi-no-miya''. Prince Takahito attended the boys' elementary and secondary departments of the [[Gakushūin|Gakushūin (Peers' School)]] from 1922 to 1932. By the time he began his secondary schooling, his eldest brother had already ascended the [[Chrysanthemum Throne]] and his next two brothers, [[Yasuhito, Prince Chichibu|Prince Chichibu]] and [[Nobuhito, Prince Takamatsu|Prince Takamatsu]], had already embarked upon careers in the [[Japanese Imperial Army]] and the [[Japanese Imperial Navy]], respectively. He enrolled in the [[Imperial Japanese Army Academy]] in 1932 and was commissioned as a sub-lieutenant and assigned to the Fifth Cavalry Regiment in June 1936. He subsequently graduated from the [[Army War College (Japan)|Army Staff College]].

Upon attaining the age of majority in December 1935, Emperor Shōwa granted him the title ''Mikasa-no-miya'' (Prince Mikasa) and the authorization to form a new branch of the Imperial Family.

=== Military service ===
[[File:Prince Mikasa 1946.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Prince Mikasa on the [[Yokosuka Line]] in 1946]]

Prince Mikasa was promoted to lieutenant in 1937 and to captain in 1939, serving in China under the name of "Wakasugi". During his army career, he was harshly critical of the Japanese military's conduct in China.&lt;ref name="Mikasa_China_war"&gt;{{cite news |last = Yoshida |first = Reiji |title = Prince Mikasa, a China war veteran who spanned three reigns, dies at 100 |url = http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/10/27/national/prince-mikasa-china-war-veteran-spanned-three-reigns-dies-100/#.WBKiplyTO_F |accessdate=27 October 2016 |agency = |publisher = The Japan Times |date=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1994 interview, he criticised the Imperial Army's invasion of and atrocities in China, and recalled having been "strongly shocked" when an officer informed him that the best way to train new recruits was to use living Chinese POWs for bayonet practice.&lt;ref name="Mikasa_China_war" /&gt; According to Daniel Barenblatt, Prince Mikasa and his cousin Prince [[Tsuneyoshi Takeda]] received a special screening by [[Shirō Ishii]] of a film showing airplanes loading [[biological warfare|germ bombs]] for [[bubonic plague]] dessemination over the Chinese city of [[Ningbo]] in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Barenblatt, ''A Plague upon Humanity'', 2004, p.32.&lt;/ref&gt; He also was given a film of Japanese atrocities, possibly linked to the footage used in ''[[The Battle of China]]'', and was so moved that he made his brother Emperor Hirohito watch the film.&lt;ref&gt;「闇に葬られた皇室の軍部批判」、『This is 読売』、一九九四年八月号57ページ&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, a newspaper revealed that after Prince Mikasa's return to Tokyo, he had written a stinging indictment of the conduct of the Imperial Japanese Army in China, where the Prince had witnessed [[Japanese war crimes|Japanese atrocities]] against Chinese civilians. The Imperial Army General Staff suppressed the document, but one copy survived and surfaced in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McCarthy |first=Terry |url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/tokyo-in-1931-poison-plot-1412180.html |title=Tokyo 'in 1931 Poison Plot' |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=6 July 1994 |accessdate=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, it was reported that while an officer, Prince Mikasa had taken a strict stance against lax discipline and the cruel actions of Japanese soldiers serving in China.&lt;ref name="Mikasa_dies_100"/&gt;

Promoted to major in 1941, Prince Mikasa served as a staff officer in the Headquarters of the [[China Expeditionary Army]] at [[Nanjing]], China from January 1943 to January 1944. His role was intended to bolster the legitimacy of the [[Wang Jingwei government|Wang Jingwei regime]] and to coordinate with Japanese Army staff towards a peace initiative, but his efforts were totally undermined by the [[Operation Ichi-Go]] campaign launched by the [[Imperial General Headquarters]].&lt;ref&gt;Bix, ''Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan'', 2000, Page 474&lt;/ref&gt;

Prince Mikasa served as a staff officer in the Army Section of the [[Imperial General Headquarters]] in Tokyo until [[surrender of Japan|Japan's surrender]] in August 1945. After the end of the war, the Prince spoke before the [[Privy Council (Japan)|Privy Council]], urging that Hirohito abdicate to take responsibility for the war.&lt;ref&gt;Bix, ''Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan'', 2000, Page 572&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage==
On 22 October 1941, Prince Mikasa married [[Yuriko, Princess Mikasa|Yuriko Takagi]] (born 4 June 1923), the second daughter of [[Viscount]] (''[[kazoku]]'', pre-war Japan's upper classes) [[Masanari Takagi]]. Prince and Princess Mikasa had five children. In addition to their five children, they had nine grandchildren and four great-grandchildren as of 2015.&lt;ref name="age100"/&gt; The couple's two daughters left the Imperial Family upon marriage. All of their sons predeceased them.

[[File:Príncipe Takahito Mikasa, Irmão do imperador do Japão.tif|thumb|224x224px|Prince Mikasa, 1958. [[Brazilian National Archives|National Archives of Brazil]].]]
After the defeat of Japan in World War II, many members of the imperial family, such as Princes Chichibu, Takamatsu and [[Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni|Higashikuni]], pressed Emperor [[Hirohito]] to abdicate so that one of the Princes could serve as regent until Crown Prince [[Akihito]] came of age.&lt;ref&gt;Bix, ''Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan'', 2000, pp. 571–573.&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 February 1946, Prince Mikasa even stood up in the privy council and indirectly urged the emperor to step down and accept responsibility for Japan's defeat. U.S. General of the Army [[Douglas MacArthur]] insisted that Emperor Hirohito retain the throne. According to Minister of Welfare Ashida's diary, "Everyone seemed to ponder Mikasa's words. Never have I seen His Majesty's face so pale."&lt;ref&gt;''Ashida Hitoshi Nikki, Dai Ikkan'', Iwanami Shoten, 1986, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, Prince Mikasa enrolled in the Literature Faculty of the [[University of Tokyo]] and pursued advanced studies in [[archaeology]], [[Middle Eastern studies]], and [[Semitic languages]]. From  1954 until his death in 2016, he directed the Japanese Society for Middle East Studies. He was honorary president of the Japan Society of Orientology. The Prince held visiting and guest faculty appointments in Middle Eastern studies and archaeology at various universities in Japan and abroad, including: [[Tokyo University of the Arts|Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music]], [[Aoyama Gakuin]], [[Tokyo Woman's Christian University]], the [[University of London]], [[Hokkaido University]] and the [[University of Shizuoka]]. He made numerous radio and television appearances, speaking on cultural subjects, and was known as "the Imperial scholar".&lt;ref name="last_years"/&gt;

==Final years and death==
Towards the end of his life, due to his advanced age, Prince Mikasa rarely made public appearances, and regularly used a wheelchair. He and Princess Mikasa lived together at a residence in the grounds of the [[Akasaka Palace|Akasaka Estate]] in [[Motoakasaka]], [[Minato, Tokyo]]. He underwent heart surgery in 2012, and made a full recovery. His routine included exercising for about 30 minutes each day with his wife at their Tokyo residence, and he often went outdoors for a roll in his wheelchair. About once a week, he would leave his home for a haircut, or to attend various events for other family members. In October 2014, he attended the Tokyo wedding of his granddaughter Princess Noriko, the second daughter of his youngest son Prince Takamado. Palace staff noted that he appeared vigorous until his last days, and that he would always be seen helping his wife to get about.&lt;ref name="last_years"&gt;{{cite news |last=|first= |title=Prince Mikasa spent his last years peacefully at Tokyo residence |url = http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/10/27/national/prince-mikasa-spent-last-years-peacefully-tokyo-residence/#.WBKPAlyTO_E |accessdate=27 October 2016 |agency= |publisher=The Japan Times |date=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to read newspapers, and enjoyed watching sumo and music programs on television.&lt;ref name="turns_100" /&gt;

On 2 December 2015, Prince Mikasa became the first member of the imperial family to become a [[centenarian]].{{efn|A cousin, [[Higashifushimi Kunihide]], was 103 at his death in 2014, but had left the imperial family in 1931 to establish a branch of the [[Higashifushimi-no-miya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.asahi.com/articles/ASF0TKY201401010021.html |script-title=ja:東伏見慈洽さん死去 天皇陛下の叔父 |trans-title=Emperor's uncle, Higashifumi Kunihide dies |language = Japanese |date = 1 January 2014 |accessdate = 2 December 2015 |work = Asahi Shimbun Digital |publisher = The Asahi Shimbun Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another cousin, [[Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni]], lived to 102 but lost his imperial titles after World War II.|name="centenarian"}} On his 100th birthday, he said, "Nothing will change just because I turn 100 years old.

On 16 May 2016, Prince Mikasa was admitted to the intensive-care unit of [[St. Luke's International Hospital]] in Tokyo's [[Chūō, Tokyo|Chuo Ward]], having contracted acute pneumonia.&lt;ref name="last_years"/&gt; He remained in hospital for the remaining months of his life. His heart weakened in June, and fluid accumulated in his lungs.&lt;ref name="Mikasa_dies_100"&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=UPDATE: Prince Mikasa, uncle of Akihito, dies at 100 years old|url=http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201610270016.html|accessdate=27 October 2016|agency=|publisher=Asahi Shimbun|date=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Princess Yuriko frequently visited him along with other Imperial family members, including the Emperor and Empress in June. During his last days, Prince Mikasa remained responsive to visitors.&lt;ref name="last_years"/&gt; On 22 October, Prince Mikasa and his wife celebrated their 75th wedding anniversary in his hospital room.&lt;ref name="Mikasa_dies_100"/&gt; His condition eventually stabilised to the point where he began to receive rehabilitation in his bed, which included stretching his arms and legs. At 7:40 a.m. on 27 October, however, his heart gradually slowed, stopping at 8 a.m. Prince Mikasa was pronounced dead at 8:34 a.m., with his wife at his side. At his death, he had outlived all of his siblings and all three of his sons.&lt;ref name="Mikasa_dies_100"/&gt;&lt;ref name="last_years"/&gt; He was also the last surviving grandson of [[Emperor Meiji]].

'''''The Poppykettle Papers''''' is a [[children's book]] written in 1999 by [[Michael Lawrence (writer)|Michael Lawrence]] and illustrated by [[Robert Ingpen|Robert R. Ingpen]].

The story follows mythical, ancient, [[Peru]]vian [[gnome]]s whose story is discovered in the modern day by two boys who find ''The Poppykettle Papers''.

== Background ==

In 1980, Robert Ingpen published ''[[The Voyage of the Poppykettle]]'', a children's book. He later published ''[[The Unchosen Land]]'', its sequel.

These stories were so popular in Ingpen's home, [[Geelong]], that a fountain and an annual [[Poppykettle Festival]] celebrate the mythical landing of the "hairy Peruvians".

''The Poppykettle Papers'' is an updated re-telling of the original two books.

== Historical and folkloric references ==

The book ties into various historical and folkloric stories of Australia's early settlement.

One such story is the discovery in 1847, by Governor [[Charles La Trobe]], of a set of keys embedded in the earth near [[Corio Bay]].  These keys, known as  the [[Geelong Keys]], are believed by some to have been dropped by Portuguese explorers some hundreds of years previously, but the Poppykettle Papers suggest another origin -- namely, that the Hairy Peruvians left them there.

'''Thonmi Sambhota''' (Thönmi Sambhoṭa, aka Tonmi Sambhodha;, Tib. ཐོན་མི་སམྦྷོ་ཊ་, Wyl. thon mi sam+b+ho Ta; b. seventh cent.) is traditionally regarded as the inventor of the [[Tibetan script]] and author of the ''Sum cu pa'' and ''Rtags kyi 'jug pa'' in the 7th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thonmi Sambhota is not mentioned in any of the ''[[Old Tibetan Annals]]'' or other ancient texts, although the ''Annals'' does mention writing shortly after 650.  [[Roy Andrew Miller]] has written a number of articles arguing that Thonmi is an entirely ahistorical person.

:"According to Tibetan tradition, Songsten Gampo sent a young man of the Thönmi or Thumi clan, Sambhoṭa son of Anu (or Drithorek Anu), to India (in 632?) with other youths, to learn the alphabet. The pattern chosen was the script of Kashmir. At all events, the ancient annals of [[Tun-huang]] record against the year 655 that 'the text of the laws was written'. It is staggering to realize that, in a couple of decades, not only was the Tibetan alphabet invented, but the script had been adapted to the Tibetan language by a highly complicated orthography, and used for the writing of documents. Thönmi is also said to have composed, no doubt later on, a very learned grammar on the Indian pattern."&lt;ref&gt;R. A. Stein. ''Tibetan Civilization''. (1972), pp. 51, 58. Stanford University Press. {{ISBN|0-8047-0806-1}} (cloth); {{ISBN|0-8047-0901-7}} (paper).&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the students sent to India, Thonmi Sambhota, said to have been the fourth of seven wise ministers of the emperor [[Songtsen Gampo]], was the only one to return to Tibet. It seems that the Tibetan script he devised, in what is believed to be [[Pabonka Hermitage]] was based on the [[Brāhmī script|Brahmi]] and [[Gupta script]]s which had been in use in India since c. 350 CE.&lt;ref&gt;''Tibet: A Political History'', p. 12. 1967. Tsepon W. D. Shakabpa. Yale University Press, New Haven and London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The White Annals'', pp. 70-73. Gedun Choephel, translated by Samten Norboo. 1978. Tibetan Library and Archives, [[Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh|Dharamsala]], H.P., India.&lt;/ref&gt;

King Songtsen Gampo is said to have retired for four years to master the new script and grammar and then made many translations including twenty [[Avalokitesvara]] texts. Other translators quickly added to the corpus of [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] translations. The "Six Codices of the Tibetan constitution" were drawn up and court records, genealogies, legends and poetry were preserved in writing.&lt;ref&gt;''Ancient Tibet: Research Materials from the Yeshe De Project'', pp. 192-193. 1986.

{{Main article|Aboriginal history of Western Australia}}
This is a '''timeline of Aboriginal history of Western Australia.'''

==1629–1829==
Aboriginal life in the two centuries from 1629 to 1829, was characterized by the increased presence of Europeans around the Western Australian coastline. First contact appears to have been characterized by open trust and curiosity, with Aborigines willing to defend themselves against any unwarranted intrusion.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Henry (2006), "The Other Side of the Frontier: Aboriginal Resistance to the European Invasion of Australia" (Penguin Books)&lt;/ref&gt;

*''See: [[Territorial evolution of Australia]] for changes in jurisdiction over the western Australian area.''
* ''4 June 1629'' After the wreck of the [[Batavia (ship)|Batavia]] at uninhabited islands, two young mutineers are marooned on the mainland.&lt;ref&gt;[[Willem Siebenhaar|Siebenhaar, W]] [[s:The Western Mail/24 December 1897/The Abrolhos tragedy|"The Abrolhos tragedy"]] [[Western Mail (Western Australia)|The Western Mail]] 24 December 1897&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''28 April 1658'' Wreck of the [[Vergulde Draeck]] or Gilt Dragon.  68 survivors made it to the mainland and disappeared.  It has been suggested that there was a "white tribe" of Aboriginal peple who survived into the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-05-14/author-raises-prospect-of-dutch-settlement/4689488 sighted 25th April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''5 January 1688'' [[William Dampier]] in the Cygnet arrives at southern latitude 18°21'. He describes the Aboriginal people he met as "the most miserable people in the world". Dampier spent time observing the people at the northern end of Cape Levique; the encounter was hostile with casualties on both sides.&lt;ref name="Dampier"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/15675/15675-h/15675-h.htm|publisher=gutenberg.org|title=files/15675/15675-h/15675-h|accessdate=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''1699'' Return of Dampier in the Roebuck, exploring from [[Broome, Western Australia|Broome]] to the [[Pilbara]].&lt;ref name="Dampier"/&gt; During this time the Portuguese in [[Timor]] raid the [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley]] for Aboriginal slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, George (ed.) (1996). To The Spice Islands and Beyond: Travels in Eastern Indonesia. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''1712'' The [[Zuytdorp]] wrecked near [[Geraldton]]. Survivors are known to have landed, and the story of their welcome and preservation by local Aborigines was known as far south as Perth 122 years later. A rock carving of what appears to be a Dutch ship has been found at Walga Rock, some 300 kilometers from the coast, up the [[Murchison River (Western Australia)|Murchison River]]&lt;ref&gt;http://wamuseum.com.au/collections/maritime/march/documents/No.%20216%20Indigenous%20depicts.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 
* ''April 1787'' [[Arthur Phillip]], Governor of [[New South Wales]] issues instructions to "endeavour by every means possible to open intercourse with the natives, and to conciliate their affections, enjoining all our subjects to live in amity and kindness to them. And if our subjects shall wantonly destroy them, or give them unnecessary interruption in the exercise of their several occupations that you cause such offenders to be punished according to the degree of that offense". {{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}
* ''1788'' [[Smallpox]] and [[measles]] arrive with the first fleet on the east coast of Australia and spread across the continent, possibly introduced as a form of biological warfare.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/ockhamsrazor/was-sydneys-smallpox-outbreak-an-act-of-biological-warfare/5395050&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''1791'' [[George Vancouver]] entered Albany harbour. He acknowledged the prior ownership of the land by Aboriginal [[Mineng]] people, and took possession of the land for the British crown. His act was premature as annexation of the west was not allowed for another thirty five years.&lt;ref&gt;he Voyage of George Vancouver 1791–1795, Volume 1. W. Kaye Lamb (ed.). Hakluyt Society. 1984&lt;/ref&gt; 
* ''1801'' [[Matthew Flinders]] visits Western Australia. In King George Sound, although Aboriginal people indicated they did not want Europeans visiting their campsite, amicable relations prevailed and trading occurred. The Aborigines called the Europeans "Djanga", or spirits returned from the dead land of Kurrenup (Karrinyup?), the land beneath the Goomber Wardarn (Sea) in the direction of the setting sun. Flinders so appreciated their friendly behaviour that he gave a special parade of the soldiers under his command. A Kirrenup kening (Noongar "corroboree") was adopted by the local people and performed by aboriginal groups along the south coast for over a century (see [[Daisy Bates (Australia)|Daisy Bates]]). The Swan River was explored by the French Captain [[Nicolas Baudin|Baudin]] in the Geographe, and his midshipman Heirisson, gives his name to the area known to the Wadjuk Noongar as Matagadup ("place of leg deep").
* ''1818'' The first of [[Phillip Parker King]]'s voyages to Western Australia. Mineng Nyungar from Albany assisted the sailors in food gathering. King also explored the Cambridge Gulf area of the Kimberley&lt;ref&gt;O'Grady, Frank (1974). ."King, Philip Gidley (1817–1904)". Australian Dictionary of Biography. 5. Canberra: Australian National University&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''1822'' King's last voyage. He was welcomed by the Mineng Noongar.&lt;ref&gt;Frank O'Grady, op cit&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''1826'' [[Mokare]], one of the Mineng Aboriginal people who later emerged as a key person for the success of early white-Aboriginal relations in Albany, was recorded in [[d'Urbville]]'s visit of that year. Colbung, ancestor of Aboriginal activist [[Ken Colbung]] is also recorded.
* ''25 December 1826'' [[Major Edmund Lockyer]], in the brig Amity, takes possession of King George Sound for the crown, at the orders of [[Governor Darling]]. On Michaelmas Island he was signalled by an Aboriginal man, who had been abducted and marooned by sealers. These eight sealers led by a certain Bailey, had also killed another man and abducted their women. Randall, another sealer from Tasmania, had also been abducting Aboriginal women, and was arrested by Lokyer. Aboriginal people here expressed their anger at Europeans cutting down trees, but Lokyer chose not to intervene. The Aboriginal site, Kin-gil-yilling&lt;!-- CITE --&gt; is renamed [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]], after the Duke of Albany.
* ''1827'' [[James Stirling (Australian governor)|James Stirling]], in the Success, anchored off the mouth of the Swan River. Exploring the river he was attacked by Aboriginal people at Claisebrook. Nine years later the Aboriginal people of the area explained that the first party of whites they had seen was the marauding party of Randall. At Jane Brook, another party of Aboriginal men was found (women and children were seen hiding), who mimicked English calls of "How do you do!" and traded spears and womeras for clothing and swans shot by Stirling. Stirling explored as far as Guildford where he commented on the fine alluvial soils. He then sailed south to Albany. Lockyer was eager to return to Sydney with the Success, with Randall, the captive and to get him to stand trial for his crimes of murder and abduction. Stirling reluctantly agreed to allow Lockyer, but refused to allow the sealers and their women on board. They were released from custody, and later left Albany.
* ''1828'' Mokkare became friends, sharing the house and food, with the assistant surgeon, Isaac Scott-Nind, in Albany. When Scott-Nind's health deteriorated, Mokkare became companion, guide and advisor to successive commandants, Lieutenant Sleeman, Captain Wakefield and Captain Barker, living with Barker when seasonal fishing brought him to King George Sound. He became an especially good friend of Dr Collie. Mokkare and his brother Nakina, assisted troops recapture runaway convicts, and were given steel tomahawks as a reward.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} By Dylan Thornley
*On 10 February 1828, the [[Cape Grim massacre]] occurred.

==1829–1881==

The settlement of Western Australia by Europeans, under [[Admiral James Stirling|James Stirling]], in the early 1840s, created a new generation of colony born young men who were engaged in hostilities with Aborigines and the imprisonment of those who dared question their authority. The settlement proceeded with the expropriation of land and the exploitation of cheap labour and the extermination of any resistance by Aborigines.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Statham-Drew|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''18 June 1829'' Declaration announcing the settlement within the Territory of Western Australia, recognising the "Aboriginal * inhabitants as British subjects and stated that any person behaving towards them in a ‘fraudulent, cruel or felonious Manner’ would be liable to prosecution and trial"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bourke|1987|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''October 1829'' Aboriginal people stole sheep, poultry and goats, and plundered a house of provisions in the Swan district. Settlers, like [[Robert Menli Lyon]], were deterred from taking up grants in outlying areas as a result of fear of Aboriginal attack. He moved to and rented, William Dixon’s land, which he later purchased. He mentioned that some of the soldiers, coming from Van Diemen’s Land came "principally from those classes in the lower orders of society who would count it a fine sport to shoot a native as a Kangaroo".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bourke|1987|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''1 November 1830'' Captain [[Frederick Irwin]] dispatched a corporal and four privates to the Upper Swan, where they were joined by armed settlers, coming on a group of Aborigines who attempted to stop their passage. The Aboriginal leader, attempting to throw a spear, was shot dead by one of the settlers. Several others were captured and brought to Perth, and subsequently released. Irwin regretted the loss of life, but hoped the Aboriginal people would be taught a lesson.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bourke|1987|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''1831'' [[George Fletcher Moore]] wrote the Aborigines were not so despicable a race as was first supposed… they are not very numerous and we are on good terms with them". Aborigines often shared food, and returned lost settlers to their homes. George Fletcher Moore was one of the settlers who allowed Aboriginal people to continue hunting on his lands. Others drove them off.
* ''26 June 1831'' [[Mokare]] dies. The [[Noongar|Noongar People]] and Europeans had assembled at Collie's house and walked to a site selected by Nakina, Mokare's brother, where the Europeans dug a grave and Mokare was interred with a [[buka cloak]] and personal artefacts to Nakina's specifications.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Dale|Dale, R.]] 1834 [[Descriptive Account of the Panoramic View &amp;c. of King George's Sound and the Adjacent Country]] [[s:Descriptive account of the panoramic view, &amp;c. of King George's Sound, and the adjacent country#9|p. 9]]&lt;/ref&gt; When Collie himself was dying from [[tuberculosis]] in 1835, he asked to be buried alongside Mokare. Their graves are together beneath [[Albany Town Hall (Western Australia)|Albany Town Hall]]. Four years after Mokare's death, the surveyor [[John Septimus Roe]] had his body exhumed and re-interred at the newly established Albany Cemetery.
* ''3 October 1831'' [[Admiral James Stirling|Stirling]] appointed [[Edward Barrett Lennard]] Commanding Officer of the Yeomanry of the Middle Swan, a citizens militia to pursue and capture Aboriginal offenders. Henry Bull was appointed Commander of the Upper Swan. The orders were that on being called out Yeomanry were "to cause the offending tribe to be instantly pursued, and if practicable captured and brought in at all hazard, and take such further decisive steps for bringing them to Punishment as the Circumstances of the Case may admit."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bourke|1987|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; From then on shepherds were armed.
* ''May 1832'' William Gaze, a settler on the Canning was killed. A witness identified [[Yagan]], son of [[Midgegooroo]] as the killer, He was declared outlaw, and twenty pounds offered for his capture.
* ''26 June 1832'' A meeting at Guildford to discuss the "Aboriginal Question"  [[Robert Menli Lyon]] reminded settlers that they had seized what was Aboriginal land and called for someone to act as mediator between the Aborigines and settlers. Amongst four resolutions passed called for whatever conciliatory or coercive measures it saw fit, and said if instead action was not taken the settlement may need to be abandoned.
*''1 August 1832'' [[Admiral James Stirling|Stirling]] establishes the Corps of Mounted Police, under the command of [[Captain Theophilus Ellis]], with a Mr Northcott as Assistant Superintendent, and orders were sent to Cape Town for horses.
*''September 1832'' [[Yagan]] was captured and sent to [[Carnac Island]]. He escaped 6 weeks later by taking the boat belonging to his captors. No attempt to recapture him was made, the six weeks being considered adequate penalty.
*''1833'' Based on evidence learned from Yagan at Carnac Island R.M. Lyon described the territory of [[Yellagonga]] as [[Mooro]], bounded by the Sea, Ellen Brook, the Swan River and Banister River (Gingin Brook or Moore River) to the north. The country of the [[Daren people]], headed by [[Weeip]], was the area from immediately south east of [[Ellen Brook]] and the upper Swan River, to the [[Darling Scarp]]. The [[Wurerup]] people, were on the upper Swan River. The [[Beeliar people|Beeliar]], were the inhabitants west of the Canning River down to Rockingham, and were led by [[Midgegooroo]]. The Beeloo were south of the Swan and east of the Canning, as far as the Darling Scarp.
*''1833–34'' Violent conflict between Aborigines and settlers, based upon Aboriginal "pay-back" killings for natives that had been killed.
*''1833'' Early in the year, in an attempt to prevent starving Aborigines stealing food from settlers, the Government established rationing stations giving flour and biscuit at [[Lake Monger]] and in the Upper Swan. Private settlers were forbidden to feed natives, except in return for work done.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bourke|1987|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''February 1833'' the first moves are taken to prevent Aborigines entering the area of the City of Perth.
* ''April 1833'' A false rumour of 200 Aborigines attacking the Preston Point Ferry, saw every man in Fremantle taking up arms to kill the Aborigines.
* ''29 April 1833'', whilst breaking into a store in [[Fremantle, Western Australia|Fremantle]] with two other Aborigines, Domjum, [[Yagan]]’s brother, was shot dead.
* ''30 April 1833'' [[Yagan]], [[Midgegooroo]] and [[Munday (Indigenous Australian)|Munday]], in reprisal, killed two white brothers named Velnick, who had been behaving badly to Aborigines, on the road between Bull Creek and Canning River. [[Yagan]] had been seen by Mr Phillips of Maddington Farm, repeatedly spearing one of the two men.
* ''1 May 1833'' Captain [[Frederick Irwin|Irwin]] declared the three to be outlaws. Thirty pounds was offered for [[Yagan]] dead or alive, twenty pounds for [[Munday (Indigenous Australian)|Munday]] and [[Midgegooroo]]. They were hunted for the next three months. The three were unaware they were being hunted.
* ''16 May 1833'', Captain Ellis was informed that Midgegooroo’s people were in the Helena Valley, and likely to cross at Drummond’s Ford, near Guildford, that night. Four soldiers of the 63rd Regiment stationed themselves at the spot, but [[Midgegooroo]] failed to appear.
* ''17 May 1833'', the soldiers with Mr Hardey of Peninsula Farm Maylands, and Hancock, a local bushman, found abandoned Aboriginal campsites in the Helena River, and captured [[Midgegooroo]] and his five-year-old son, after a short struggle, while he was looking after women and children whilst the men were away hunting, He was imprisoned in Perth jail.
* ''21 May 1833'', [[Midgegooroo]] was tried before Captain [[Frederick Irwin|Irwin]] and the Executive Council, found guilty, and taken outside the jail immediately killed by firing squad, before a gathering of colonists. Those present expressed their satisfaction by loud exultations at his execution. Midgegooroo’s tribe expressed dissatisfaction when it was learned that he had been executed, and two parties of six soldiers each were sent to patrol the Swan and Canning Rivers to protect settlers from angry Aborigines. At the same time, Constable Hunt, together with four soldiers and three colonists were sent to the Upper Swan to capture [[Yagan]] and [[Munday (Indigenous Australian)|Munday]], said to be hiding amongst [[Weeip]]’s people. Shortly afterwards [[Yagan]] approached George Fletcher Moore at Millendon, and in pidgin English insisted that it was wrong for Aborigines to steal from settlers, and also wrong for whites to kill Aborigines caught stealing. When an Aborigine was killed by a settler, [[Yagan]] insisted that it was permissible for an Aboriginal to kill the settler, as payback in accordance with their custom. Moore insisted that if a settler was caught stealing he would be shot too, as the Aboriginal had been. If killing and theft stopped, Moore explained there would be peace between the races. In Nyungar [[Yagan]] explained that the Europeans had come to disrupt the Aboriginal people in their lives, and are fired upon by Europeans in their own country. He declared they would take European lives in revenge for any death of [[Midgegooroo]]. The next day Mr Shaw informed [[Yagan]] that [[Midgegooroo]] had been executed. Settlers in Upper Swan seemed to be defying the order to capture him, and Lieutenant Ball gave orders to his servants that [[Yagan]] was not to be shot. Friendly overtures were extended to [[Weeip]], despite the refuge he was giving to Yagan and Munday.
* ''June 1833'', the Agricultural Society Meeting discussed the growing problem with Aborigines and suggested specific measures rather than extermination be followed. A fortnight later, a party of the 63rd Regiment, under the command of Captain Ellis set out to hunt [[Yagan]], and was promised help by [[Weeip]] in finding him, but was unsuccessful. [[Weeip]] was taken to Perth by Mr Bull and others from the Upper Swan to meet with the Lieutenant Governor.
* ''11 July 1833'', a young man of 18 years, William Keats, and his brother, two of Bull’s servants, on a cattle drive, saw a group of Aborigines, including [[Yagan]], approaching Bull’s house for flour. The Aborigines were generally friendly. After two failed attempts over an extended period, William shot [[Yagan]] in the head, and was immediately speared to death by aborigines accompanying Yagan. James Keats then shot Heegan, one of the other Aboriginals who was about to throw his spear, and aimed at Weeip, also about to throw his spear, but missed. Keat’s brother James, then escaped by swimming the River, and saw a group, including [[Weeip]], spearing William repeatedly. William Cruse, after hearing of the affair, accompanied by six others returned to the spot, found the gun had been used also as a club, and then following the sound of crying, found the wounded Heegan and the dead [[Yagan]]. Heegan was then shot through the head, to "put him out of his misery". The Editor of the Perth Gazette condemned William Keats for his treachery in killing Yagan and warned settlers there would be another round of reprisals from Aborigines. Two weeks later, the Lieutenant Governor issued a proclamation that [[Munday (Indigenous Australian)|Munday]] was no longer an outlaw as sufficient retribution had been made for the death of the Velvick brothers. James Keats claimed the reward, and Heegan’s family informed others that James Keats would be killed in retribution for the death of Heegan. Lieutenant Bull encouraged Keats to leave the colony on board the Cornwallis.
* ''January 1834'', for the February meeting of the Agricultural Society of Guidford, R. M. Lyon gave notice of a motion to set aside lands for the sole use of Aborigines in every district. He said it was incumbent on settlers who had disposed the Aborigines of their lands to do so, and that the Legislative Council effectively secure Aboriginal rights and privileges as promised, including unrestricted fishing and hunting rights on all unclaimed lands. No vote was taken and the matter was deferred until Stirling returned to the colony. Lyon was expelled from the society by members when Stirling had returned.
* ''February 1834'', Aboriginal "theft" had increased again, and Lieutenant Governor Irwin appointed Captain [[Peter Pégus]] as an additional Superintendent of Native Tribes, with a staff of four soldiers, with duties to distribute rations and pursue Aboriginal "offenders".
* ''April 1834'' [[Calyute]] leads a raid by thirty [[Binjareb]] on Shenton's Mill in [[South Perth, Western Australia|South Perth]]. Shenton was locked inside and the flour was taken. [[Calyute]], Gunmal and Yedong were subsequently captured. Gunmal and Yedong were tied, flogged with 24 lashes at the St Georges Terrace whipping post. Calyute was transferred to Fremantle Round House, and there given another 60 lashes and released in May.
* ''May 1834'' Mr Locke Burgess surprised a group of Aboriginal people stealing grain from their farm at Brook Mount. A warrant was sought for the arrest of Yeedamira, the leader of the group, who was arrested, but was shot dead on trying to escape from the Barracks. In retaliation [[Weeip]] and Godaljud led a group to the Barracks where in payback they killed Private Dennis Larkin, one of the soldiers there. A jury found Weeip, Bilyomeri, Goldaljud, Beguin, Gotark, Gregad, and Narrall, all "guilty of wilful murder", insisting, contrary to British justice, that the whole group was guilty for a crime perpetrated by one. This was unpopular amongst Upper Swan settlers, who admired Weeip and they petitioned the government claiming that Goodalyat had been the Aboriginal who had speered Larkin.
* ''June 1834'' Bilyomeri, [[Weeip]]'s son, captured by Captain Ellis and imprisoned in Fremantle. Captain Ellis, Captain Pegus and Mr Norcott were instructed to maintain constant patrols between the Swan and Canning and to conduct instant floggings of any Aboriginal caught committing an offence.
* ''July 1834'' [[Calyute]] and twenty one other Binjareb were involved in the payback death of Thomas Nesbitt, a servant of [[Thomas Peel]]. Nesbitt had been friendly with the Aborigines and his death sparked major concern. Mr Parker, the Constable at Guildford, was told that a vessel had been seen wrecked six months earlier on the beach thirty days walking to the north and coins were found scattered on the beach.
* ''September 1834'' Stirling, returning from Albany, pardons Weeip and his son, after Weeip, at the instigation of [[George Fletcher Moore]], had travelled north looking unsuccessfully for the shipwreck and any survivors.
* ''25–28 October 1834'' the so-called "[[Battle of Pinjarra]]" in which between 15–40 Aboriginal men women and children were killed, and an unknown number wounded, and one settler was wounded and another later lost his life, probably from a coma from concussion from falling from his horse. ''See [[Battle of Pinjarra]]''
* ''1 January 1835'' Forty three starving Aborigines, gleaning fallen grain from an already harvested field in [[Maylands, Western Australia|Maylands]] were shot at.
* ''7 January 1835'' Aborigines were expelled from their [[Lake Monger]] campsite as it was considered a threat to the nearby Leeder Farm.
* ''February 1835'' [[John McKail]] wakes and shoots Gogalee, the adolescent son of [[Yellagonga]], after suspecting Aborigines from a nearby camp were going through his possessions. Narrail, the son of Yagan was also clubbed to death.
* ''March 1835'' Stirling attempts a reconciliation, realising things had gone too far. To prevent a payback killing from [[Yellagonga]], or from his son Nandra, who was grieving over the death of hos brother, Stirling ordered the immediate arrest of McKail. Yellagonga was invited to witness his trial. Stirling then acted to seal a peace treaty with the Perth Noongar, distributing fifty loaves of bread, after the celebration of a peace "kening" (= Noongar, ''"[[corroboree]]"'')  McKail was eventually let free on a legal technicality. Francis Armstrong secured the peace by ensuring that McKail repaid Yellagonga with food and blankets. McKail was then banished from Perth, and moved to Albany, where he became a well known local settler. The case established an unfortunate precedent, as henceforth an Aborigine's testament was not accepted unless supported by white testimony.
* ''May 1835'' James Twine, travelling to York was speared, and his companion, Murphy was killed. Resistance massacres and payback reprisal killing now move into the [[Balardong]] lands.
* ''1 June 1835'' at the first Foundation Day celebration, Aborigines engaged in spear throwing competitions, children ran in races for sweats, and [[Miago]] (Mogo), a Canning Aboriginal won the race against settlers and other Aboriginal people.
* ''June 1835'' Trimmer, a York settler, determined to end Aboriginal pilfering from his farm, armed an illiterate labourer, Edward Gallop, in the roof of his barn. Gallop, that night, shot one of the two thieves dead. This ushered in a new and violent turn in the York resistance. Mr Trimmer, and Mr Bland, a government representative were attacked in reprisal and only escaped due to the speed of their horses. Yellagong was attacked as a payback reprisal by Balardong, for these and other white killings of Aborigines in the York area, and two Aboriginal children were killed.
* ''October 1835'' Dr Collie, with deteriorating heath was given permission to return to Scotland, but with his illness could not leave King George Sound.
* ''8 November 1835'' Dr Collie dies and was buried, according to his wishes, in the same grave as his friend Mokkare, under what is now the Albany Town Hall.
* ''December 1835'' Captain [[Frederick Irwin]] speaking to the Dublin Branch of the [[London Missionary Society]] explained the need to "[[Christian]]ise the Natives". This led to the establishment of the "West Australian Missionary Society".
* ''1836'' [[Francis Armstrong]], the official Interpreter of the Native Tribes, stated that it was Aboriginal tradition that the Aboriginal population of the coast migrated from the plateau and that the Aboriginal people living on the coast are descendent from a few early families, at a time when Garden island was still joined to the coast. Garden Island and Rottnest were still joined to the mainland until 7,000 years ago.
* ''July 1836'' The West Australian Missionary Society brought [[Louis Gustiniani]], an ex-Catholic priest, to Western Australia with his wife and two catechists (Waldecks), and travels to a site previously purchased by the "West Australian Missionary Society"in Middle Swan to begin his work. He was appalled at the way in which settlers were competing amongst themselves by collecting the ears of Aboriginal people they had slain. Balardong Nyungar were retaliating by spearing settlers and stock and burning homesteads. Settlers along the Avon had fenced all of the permanent summer waterholes and were shooting at natives seen inside these fences.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{harvp|Roynolds|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''July 1836'' Lieutenant Bunbury is transferred from William to York, and becomes involved in killing local Aborigines. His diary records that in this month he "shot a few of them one night".
* ''August 1836'' A massed attack on the Waylen household in [[Toodyay]], defended by four settlers and two soldiers, left four Aboriginal men dead. Bunbury tracked one wounded Aboriginal man into the bush and shot him through the head. Bunbury also recorded the names of another 11 Aboriginal men he killed during one occasion.
* ''September 1836'' Bland, another York settler, shot and killed another Aboriginal "trespasser".
* ''1836'' Gear, a popular Aborigine, brought to the courthouse and accused of stealing wheat, is sentenced to 40 lashes. Gustiniani,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; horrified, offers to defend all future Aborigines brought to court free of charge. This makes him very unpopular with settlers. Armstrong Records the removal of the Waugal eggs from the Goonininup sacred site at Mount Eliza. The subsequent loss of an anchor at the site led to attempts to get local Aborigines to dive and retrieve it. Wadjuk natives refuse, but a Yed man from Moore diver decides to, but he drowns and his body is not recovered, justifying to the local people that the site is ''winaitj'' (sacred).
* ''December 1836'' The brother of the man shot by Bland, took revenge upon Knott, an old man living alone about 5 kilometres from [[York, Western Australia]]. Payback shootings and reprisals continued.
* ''1837'' The British House of Commons committee into the rights of Aboriginal people before the law debated "should district magistrates be allowed to issue summary punishments?" as was happening in Western Australia. "Should Aborigines have the power to appear in court? Could they be represented by Counsel? Have the rights to an interpreter?"  The Buxton Select Committee on Native Peoples ruled that within the recollections of many living men "every part of this territory was the undisputed property of the Aborigines". However, in the establishment of the colonies it did not appear that the "territorial rights of the natives were considered" and in fact their claims "whether as sovereigns or as proprietors of the soil, have been utterly disregarded. The land has been taken from them without the assertion of any title other than that of superior force."  This was ruled as contrary to British common law, and the report acknowledged that it must be an oversight. It stated that the effects of this dispossession would continue to be enormous for the settlers of the colony until the injustice had been corrected.

:Francis Armstrong visits the 8 Wadjuk campsites around Perth and records only 295 people out of the 1500 there were estimated to have lived there at the time of the arrival of the first settlers 7 years before. The smallest groups were those in greatest proximity to the white settlements. This would seem to indicate that contact with the [[Djanga]] (Spirits of the dead = the name given to the settlers) was proving fatal to Aboriginal groups, through killings and reprisals, starvation, or disease, and there may have also been elevated intra-Aboriginal payback killings with a rising rate of accusation for sorcery – (a result of the increase inexplicable to Aboriginal people, of the rise in fatal diseases).  Neville Green&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Green|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; also believes there may have been a deliberate wish to avoid contact, amongst people who still had a viable culture.

:Stirling warns the York settlers to have no dealings with Aboriginal people, trying to "impress on every European the necessity  there is by keeping arms in [working] order". As a result, Heal, a local "settler" set his dogs against a group of women trying to access what had been their local waterhole. The women were obliged to seek safety in a deep pool. A reprisal spearing of Heal, obtained whilst working with his partner, on Mr Burns, was prevented from becoming fatal by Mrs Burns threatening the attackers with a gun. Despite an offer of reward the "aggressors" were never captured. A corroboree and an offer of restitution by two men, brought the matter to a satisfactory conclusion. The new Government resident in York only made matters worse, when he arrested the two men supposedly involved and sent them to Perth for trial. One died along the way as a result of the brutality of his treatment in white hands initiated a new round of violence. Peter Chidlow and Edward Jones, were speared by Balardong Noongar, who had believed they had been deliberately tricked into taking lime instead of flour. Woods, a York settler, left a poisoned damper for Aboriginal people, and other gifts of poisoned flour were the cause of another round of reprisals.

* ''May 1837'' Giustiniani protested against George Moore sentencing an Aboriginal for 7 years for stealing one bunch of grapes, growing on what had until 1829 been his own land.
* ''June 1837'' Yellagonga's wife was arrested on a trifling charge and forced to sleep on a cold stone floor without a blanked or any heating at all. She was released without trial in a very sick condition. George Fletcher Moore taunts Giustianini with finding Goordap guilty of killing a sheep. He was sentenced to 7 years transportation to Rottnest, "beyond the seas". Gear, another Wadjuk Noongar, is imprisoned for a month and given 48 lashes, for stealing a handful of flour.
* '' July 1837 '' James Minchin and 5 other settlers killed in the Henley Brook area of the middle Swan river by native Aborigines.
* ''October 1837'' Giustianini becomes the first white person to defend any Aboriginal person tried in a court of law. Durgap was sentenced for stealing a handful of dough, and sent for 7 years beyond the seas, Neu-anung denied involvement in the theft, but admitted to eating some of the flour. He was sentenced to 6 months hard labour. Googot, a third prisoner, was sentenced to 7 years transportation for stealing 10&amp;nbsp;lb (5&amp;nbsp;kg) of fresh butter. As a result of his efforts to help defend these Aborigines, Giustianini is ridiculed by the local media.

: Moore then travelled throughout the York District, with Garbung, the son of one of the Aborigines defended by Giustianini, hoping to mediate a peace to the almost continuous killings that had been occurring over the previous 2 years.

* ''January 1838'' [[George Grey]]'s party set out from [[Hanover Bay]] following the [[Glenelg River (Western Australia)|Glenelg River]] during the expedition they encounter a group of Aboriginals. Grey was speared, the wound formed an abscess forcing the party to return to Hanover Bay, where they packed up the base camp and sailed to [[Mauritius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Biggs|1997|pp=35–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''13 February 1838'' Giustianini leaves WA shocked and dismayed at the treatment of Aboriginal people by the settlers. The failure of the governor to punish settlers in the York district, guilty of massacre meant that Balardong Nyungar in the area were decimated.
* ''May 1838'' Aboriginal groups don't leave the coast as normal but gathered to feast off the carcases left by 13 whalers, gathered at Fremantle.
: The Mount Eliza Aboriginal Feeding Station, the sacred site of Goonininup, is closed, and the site was purchased for a steam mill.  (The Swan Brewery later acquired the site as it had sufficient fresh water to aid the brewing of beer).

* ''July 1838'' The popular and charismatic, Molly Dobbin, was found guilty of breaking into a house and sentenced to transportation for 7 years. With nine other Aboriginal prisoners he was taken to Rottnest under the supervision of Corporal Welch and three privates of the 21st regiment. They escaped by burning down the tree to which they had been chained at night, and took Mr Thompson's boat to the mainland., where one was drowned as the boat capsized in the surf. The prisoners were recaptured and returned with extended sentences.
:With the closure of the Mount Eliza Feeding Station, Francis Armstrong was given a town house in St Georges Tce, and his neighbours complain of the Aborigines who were coming to see him. A petition was started which claimed for the first time that the "proximity of Aborigines would lower the value of the land". This culminated in new legislation to ban Aborigines from the Perth settlement.

* ''August 1838'' Lieutenant [[George Grey]] whilst exploring the [[Yanchep]] region, is taken to be the returned Djanga of a woman called Nginyeran. The Aborigines kept up a constant wailing outside Grey's house "She must see her son, she must see her son". Grey agreed to an enormous kening ([[corroboree]]) held in his honour at [[Yanchep]]. At the corroboree the group parted to allow the woman and her family to approach Grey. Hugging him around the neck she cried "Boondoo, boondoo. Nanga koolong" (=True, true. My boy).&lt;ref&gt;This tale is told to [[Daisy Bates (Australia)|Daisy Bates]] in 1907 by [[Joobaitj]], grandson of Yellagonga, who was at that time a Beedawa (=uninitiated boy) witnessing the corroboree&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}&lt;!-- Dispute this story, Grey wasn't in the Colony during this  time period --&gt;
* ''September 1838'' Corporal Welch was replaced by Henry Vincent, as Superintendent of Aboriginal Prisoners.
: The London based Aboriginal Protection Society sets up an Australian sub-committee that ruled that Britain had oppressed the Aborigines by taking their land "without treaties or consent founded on sufficient compensation".

* ''1 January 1839'' Following a House of Commons enquiry into the treatment of Aborigines by settlers, Governor Hutt appointed as second governor of Western Australia. Like Gipps in Queensland and George Grey in South Australia, as part of the concern of the British Crown into the poor treatment of Aborigines he was ordered to find ways of encouraging the civilising and Christianity of the natives. On arrival Hutt immediately set up a Department for the control of Aboriginal Affairs, to deal with the dispossessed natives and bring them rapidly into Christianity and civilise them. It consisted of 2 Commissioners, whose salaries were appointed and paid for from England, 2 protectors, a translator, 2 mounted inspectors and 18 mounted [[Aboriginal tracker]]s, a jailer and a military guard on Rottnest. Francis Armstrong was appointed the first Commissioner.
* ''1 April 1839'' George Grey's 4th expedition to explore between Shark Bay and Fremantle was wrecked at the mouth of the Murchison. The disaster was saved by Kaiber, a Binjareb man who had befriended Grey on his third expedition searching for a lost settler between Williams and Bunbury. Kaiber negotiated with local [[Yamatji]] tribes for safe passage and sustenance for the shipwrecked crew. Grey was impressed by Kaiber's obvious intelligence. 320 kilometres north of Perth the party divided with Grey and Kaiber going ahead to secure aid. The Governor dispatched [[Weeip]] and Warrup to find the missing explorers who were located 100&amp;nbsp;km further north.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}
* ''1839'' The [[smallpox vaccine]] was brought to Western Australia, but for the next 15 years it was used only for the white settlers, despite its virulent effects on Aboriginal populations.
* ''January 1840'' Edward John Eyre sets out with George Baxter, 2 New South Wales Aboriginals, Joey and Yarry, and Wylie, a young Mineng Noongar from Albany set out to cross from Fowlers' Bay to Albany.
* ''29 April 1840'' Baxter killed by Joe and Yarry, and the supplies for the expedition were stolen. Wylie and Eyre push on with their rations reduced to spoonful of sugar and a strip of dried horse-meat.
* ''June 1840'' arrival of Methodist pastor, Reverend John Smithies, as a mission for the Aborigines, at Fremantle. He was met and welcomed by Francis Armstrong, in his new capacity, as protector for the Aborigines.
* ''9 July 1840'' Eyre and Wylie arrive in Albany, and Wylie is treated with joy follow his safe return, as he had been thought dead. Eyre gave him a shot-gun and the York Agricultural Society presented him with a badge and a gift of money.
* ''September 1840'' Reverend Smithies opens an Aboriginal subscription based chapel in William street. Francis Armstrong (called ''Branji'' by the Noongar), and his wife May, were appointed as teachers, and started with a class of thirty boys and girls. This was the first and last secular attempt to educate children in their vernacular language first, until the 1970s. Unfortunately Armstrong and his wife removed the children from their parents, the first precedent for what was to become known as the [[Stolen Generations]]. At the end of their schooling they were sent to work as servants to selected white families in return for basic subsistence.
* ''1840'' Joseph Stokes marries a teenage graduate of the Perth Native School, the first recorded marriage between a European and a Noongar. Mrs Stokes taught her illiterate husband how to read and write. In London, the "''[[Aboriginal Protection Society]]''" published an "''Outline for a System for Legislation Securing the Protection of All Inhabitants of All Countries Colonised by Great Britain'''" which "''urged that it be a fundamental principle of colonisation that no settlement be made on any land possessed or claimed by its inhabitants, without consent, formally obtained by treaty or otherwise substantially acknowledged by them''". Today Aboriginal people are still awaiting their Treaty, and only 151 years later were their land rights legally acknowledged.
* ''August 1841'' The Aborigines who had remained at Goonininup (the Swan Brewery site) since the closure of the Aboriginal Feeding Station there, were moved to an Anglican run camp site at Jane Brook (the "West Australian Missionary Society" mission site) where the Reverend Giustianini's mission school was reopened under the control of Abraham Jones. Subsequently, an Anglican Aboriginal school on similar lines was opened in Fremantle by Revd George King. An influenza outbreak that year killed 11 of the Abraham Jones's school's 23 students, making parents very reluctant to have their children educated there. At this camp are the first recorded Aboriginal cases of venereal disease and tuberculosis as well as influenza. The diseases were subsequently to sweep through Aboriginal populations in the state.
* ''1840'' Governor Hutt announced a land bounty as a remission of a land purchase price for those white settlers who consent to train Aborigines. The Governor also creates the position of Aboriginal ''Police Aides'', and [[Maigo]], [[Molly Dobbin]] and [[Munday (Indigenous Australian)|Munday]] from Perth, Mundigo and Mando from the Canning, Tonquin and Winat from the Upper Swan, Denmar and Mornang from the Murray [[Binjareb]], and Bunni from the Vasse [[Wardandi]] were all appointed, although Maigo was later dismissed for beating his wife. Also an Act was passed, establishing Rottnest as a prison, although the Governor states that it was to be a training establishment to domesticate and prepare Aborigines for employment. Stirling's "rations" for Aborigines displaced by settlement, were reduced to 500 grams of flour per month, only given in return for good behaviour. Eventually it was cut out altogether, forcing Aboriginal people to seek labouring jobs from the people who had seized their land.
* ''1842'' Crown versus Wewar tries the first Aboriginal for a tribal killing. After being found guilty Wewar was transported to Rottnest. Henry Trigg accompanied him to the island to build the [[Rottnest lighthouse]], and learned that Wewar was perplexed at the governors displeasure. He stated that Aboriginal people never interfered with white ways of murders, why should whites interfere with what was a traditional Aboriginal matter. This precedent was to have a disastrous effect upon Noongar and other Aboriginal group's marriage customs, as Aboriginals who made ''winnaitj'' or ''mundju'' illegal liaisons, and would have been punished by losing their lives, now could make incestuous liaisons  formerly outlawed by kinship principles, with impunity. Those enforcing the punishments were now not allowed to and were themselves punished by European courts, and could be tried and hanged. "''Winnaitj''" marriages proliferated, as traditional law gets flouted. Henry Trigg reported seeing Aboriginal prisoners at Rottnest weeping at the sight of cooking fire smoke from relatives cooking on the mainland. In York, Barrow resigns as Protector of the Aborigines to be replaced by R. H. Bland, who took a very punitive attitude to the local Balardong.
* ''10 June 1843'' Death of Yellagonga, by drowning.
* ''1843'' Father John Brady visits Western Australia and writes to Rome appealing for missionaries to be sent to the natives of Western Australia. Charles Symmonds, Protector of Aborigines, has the northern Aborigines Eanna and Bokoberry arrested and confined to Rottnest to ''"teach them, outwardly at least, to conform to our social regulations"''. Those who had acquired farming skills in Rottnest gardens, and assisted in harvesting salt, were given early pardon and allowed to return home. Wollaston noted that large numbers of Aborigines in the south west were dying from epidemics.
* ''1844'' Aboriginal school was shifted to Wanneroo. George Shenton, as Governor of the School, reports that it is hard work trying to destroy the natural habits of Aboriginal bush life. Cultural genocide was the educational policy and was now firmly established.
* ''1846'' [[George Grey]] leaves Western Australia. Writing of his experiences in the state, he said that despite those who treat Aborigines as inferior, that they were "as apt and intelligent as any race of men that I am acquainted with". His experience with indigenous people was to deepen throughout his life until as Governor of New Zealand he insisted in the New Zealand Constitution that seats be reserved for Maoris in the new Parliament.
* ''1847'' 8,000 kangaroo skins exported from Albany.
* ''1851'' Few Balardong in the York district were left, and they were ravaged by starvation, venereal disease and influenza.
* ''1852'' Systematic raiding by Aborigines of cattle in the [[Geraldton]] area continues into 1853. It would seem that from 1829 some 30 European settlers in Western Australia had been killed by this time and another 34 had been wounded. No record was kept of aboriginal casualties but a ratio of 10–20 times this number is suggested.
* ''1877'' Just before her death [[Mary Ellen Cuper]] (born Ellen Pangieran), who was an expert Morse Code operator, trained another Aboriginal woman Sarah Ninak, to take her place.&lt;ref name="adb"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |last=Pope |first=Brian |encyclopedia=[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]] |title=Cuper, Mary Ellen (1847–1877) |url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/cuper-mary-ellen-12873 |access-date=12 October 2018 |language= |edition= |year=1967 |publisher=Australian National University |series= |volume=Supplementary Volume |location= |id= |isbn= |doi= |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Governor Ord issued a proclamation forbidding the practice of chaining natives together with neck chains, but it continued unabated.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}
* ''1879'' Alexander Forrest explored from the De Grey River north to Beagle Bay, and then along the Fitzroy River to the Victoria River in the Northern Territory. It seems that the method of capturing local natives to torture them into telling where the water holes were had become a common practice{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}, which explains why Forrest reported that the natives appeared excessively frightened of the whites. At Beagle Bay however, he was surprised by the friendliness of the natives, many of whom spoke Broken English.

==1881–1943==

The sixty years from 1881 to the 1940s can be neatly divided into two by the passage of the 1905 Aboriginal Act, which created institutionalised racism and created what amounted to Aboriginal "concentration camps" in which the Aboriginal people were to be confined until the race became extinct. It began with the [[Fairburn Report]] which first drew attention to the "Aboriginal Problem."  This institutionalised racism, like the racism of the Nazi period in Germany, the racism of the southern states of the USA, and the racism of South Africa, reached its peak in the 1930s. The "final solution to the Aboriginal problem" was to take all children from Aboriginal parents, who were considered as "biologically capable of having children, but not socially capable of raising them."  This "solution" continued beyond this period until well into the 1970s. The major task confronting Aboriginal people throughout this period was how their cultures could survive.

* ''1881'' C.D.F. Foss appointed magistrate and with a company of police troops and 3 Aboriginal trackers, he travelled across the Gascoyne investigating complaints and imposing sentences that were later shown to be illegal and excessive. Pastoralists had made Aboriginal people de facto slaves on their own land, in contravention of British law. By marking a cross on a "contract," Aboriginal people were forced to work as a shepherd, shearer, shed hand, domestic servant or concubine. Once "assigned" the men and women were considered the "property" of the station, and could be arrested and sent back by the police if they "absconded."  Consistent absconders had their feet burned or were branded by their master's initial. The Fairburn Report, which reported on these abuses was howled down by angry pastoralists in Parliament. Aboriginal labour in the state was recorded as 1,640 men and 706 women, nearly 7% of the total white population of the time, estimated at 30,013 people.
* ''June 1881'' The first judicial court held on Brockman's station. Four Aboriginal men were tried and sentenced to be transported to Rottnest Island. Aboriginal resistance in the north grew in intensity. Gascoyne, Lyons and the Upper Minilya tribes were said to be the worst in the state. Charles Gayle asked that the government to shut its eyes for 6 months and he would put an end to the depredations by exterminating the troublemakers.
* ''1882'' Flogging of Aboriginal prisoners on Rottnest was legalised, although it had already been abolished for whites. John Forrest spoke in favour of the punishment. Only the cat-of-nine-tails was prohibited, but its use continued, being used at the Moore River settlement at least until 1940. It was admitted in the Legislative Council that the great majority of convictions of Aboriginal people to Rottnest, had been illegal. Governor Ord intervened and a large number of Aboriginal people were released from custody. Alexander Crawfords, running a sheep station in the Murchison, and writing to his fiance, Lillie Matthews in Victoria, wrote of the continuous way in which whites "in arms" were engaged in "nigger hunts."  Lillie was horrified at the brutality he so casually described. The Gold Rushes brought still more unattached men to Western Australia, many contracting both legal and de facto marriages with Aboriginal women. Typical was Anderson, a Fin, who married Lucy Bobbinet, and having three children before she was abandoned by her husband in 1899.
* ''1883'' The Attorney General, Hensman, introduces a bill to parliament to extend the powers of Magistrates in the north, and to legalise all questionable sentences to Rottnest Island that had occurred. The Colonial Secretary, Malcolm Fraser, said at the second reading speech, the bill was intended to "affirm the convictions made by Mr Foss at the Gascoyne".&lt;ref&gt;Parliamentary Hansard, Western Australia 1883&lt;/ref&gt;  A Commission of Inquiry into the treatment of Aboriginal prisoners on Rottnest confirmed that the identifying disks on prisoners were sometimes exchanged, resulting in the alteration of sentences, and the release of prisoners often in alien territory from which they were then forbidden to leave. Over 179 Rottnest island prisoners, mostly from the north, were in conditions so overcrowded that more than 60 died from a bout of influenza. The second great measles epidemic entered the state via Albany, spreading to Bunbury, York, Fremantle, Perth, Geraldton and Carnarvon. Ten died at New Norcia as a result, and with a combined influenza outbreak, it combined to kill 64 prisoners at Rottnest. In this year Victoria River station, in the Kimberley, was stocked for the first time.
* ''1884'' Alexander Forrest publishes his report on the Kimberley expedition, estimating that some {{convert|10000000|acre|km2}} are available for grazing sheep and cattle. Just before Forrest had left Darwin, the Commissioner of Crown Lands had been presented with 26 applications to take up the most promising lands in the Kimberley. Adam Johns and Phil Saunders, following Forrest's route, discovered Gold at Halls Creek. David Carly wrote to England saying "the whole system of Horrors as is done to the Natives" would continue until the "Home Government send someone here who has got a mind that will not be ruled by a few Settlers whose Heart is set on getting Gold by any means". In Bridgetown, a third Aboriginal reserve of {{convert|100|acre|km2}} was established.
* ''1885'' The Duracks settle Lissadell station in the Kimberleys. E.T. Hardiman, the government geologist, confirms the find of Halls Creek gold. Fifteen men at the field clash with local Aborigines, but resistance to miners declined as the numbers increased. An amendment to the Dog Act states that Aboriginal people in the state are only allowed one dog and then only if it is licensed. Most Aboriginal people in the state could not afford the license, and so police could shoot any Aboriginal hunting dog any time they wished.
* ''January 1885'' Henry Parry, the Anglican Archbishop lodged for new "mission reserves" to be established for the Vasse, Murchison, Ashburton and Gascoyne. He welcomes the Rev. J.B. Gribble and sends him to work amongst the Aborigines in the Gascoyne. Gribble arrives in Perth and is introduced to the Governor, Sir Napier Broome. He is given letters of introduction to Maitland Brown and Alexander Forrest. On arriving in Carnarvon Gribble was welcomed by Foss the Magistrate, however, at the time he witnessed six Aboriginal men and one Aboriginal woman, chained by the neck to a tree, awaiting the magistrates visit, still some weeks away. Thirty seven men were chained inside a tin shed in the summer heat. Moving to the Kimberley, Gribble discovered that police raiding parties, along the Fitzroy were organised to keep the pearling industry supplied with "blackbirded" Aborigines to work on the luggers, in contravention of the earlier Pearl Shell Fisheries Act. Many pastoralists and jackeroos had taken Aboriginal concubines, but any girl who tried to run away was rounded up and escorted by police back to her "master". Finding no support amongst locals to end these practices Gribble travelled back to Perth to publicise what he had found. The uproar was huge. Rather than alienate those pastoralists who were contributing to the building of St Georges Cathedral, Bishop Parry decided to sacrifice Gribble to the indignation of the pastoralists.
* ''December 1885'' a meeting of pastoralists in Carnarvon appoint Brockman, Maitland Brown and others to condemn Gribble's missionary work. Nothing changed. There was still no attempt to properly establish guilt of Aboriginal people "sentenced" to Rottnest from the north. For instance on 28 December men were found a quarter of a mile away from speared cattle and were found guilty of an offence without any evidence being presented, and were sentenced to 2 years on Rottnest
* ''January 1886'' A petition is circulated to have Gribble removed. Gribble travelled then to Victoria, trying to drum up support against the WA pastoralists of the Gascoyne, and entertained people to packed halls with the stories of the atrocities he had witnessed. So grim were the reports that women and children were refused admittance. In his talks he exposed the widespread practice of "child labour" and condemned the "assignment system" as slavery. He protested the abuses of the court system in Carnarvon, where it was admitted that convictions against Aboriginals were secured with a single uncorroborated word of any settler, with the person being transported to Rottnest, often to die. Gribble reported that he had been shot at in the bush and nearly lynched when sailing to Perth. When he was met by "Christian communicants" in Fremantle, he was told that Aboriginal people should be treated "only as horses or dogs". Winthrop Hackett, then Editor of the Western Australian called Gribble "a lying, canting humbug," and Gribble sued him for libel. At the height of the controversy, Governor Broome classified as confidential a series of reports from the Government Resident of Roebourne, Lieutenant Colonel E. F. Angelo, documenting the slavery and murder perpetrated by local pearlers, settlers, and the local magistrate, who was offering to kidnap Aborigines for the pearlers at a cost of five pounds a head, or to shoot them for 2s 6p each. "The fears of the whites" he wrote, was "more a cause of disorder than the aggression of the blacks."  About 6-700 Aborigines were then used in diving off the pearling luggers. Had these reports been made available Gribble would have won his case against Hackett, but he lost, and in disgrace, Gribble left the state, and publishes "Dark Deeds in a Sunny Land" a fierce castigation of his opponents that created a furore so that the welfare of the Aboriginals was obscured by much blackening of reputations until the 1905 Aboriginal Act.
* ''1886'' Following the furor over the Fairburn Report and the work of the Rev. John Gribble, parliament introduced the Aborigines Protection Act 1886 (WA) which established the Aboriginal Protection Board with five members and a secretary, all of whom were nominated by the Governor. Protectors of Aborigines were appointed by the board under the conditions laid down in the Aborigines Protection Act of 1886. In theory, Protectors of Aborigines were empowered to undertake legal proceedings on behalf of Aboriginal people. As the board had very limited funds Protectors received very limited remuneration, and so a range of people were appointed as local Protectors, including Resident Magistrates, Jail Wardens, Justices of the Peace and in some cases ministers of religion, though most were local Police Inspectors. The minutes of the board show they mostly dealt with matters of requests from religious bodies for financial relief and reports from Resident or Police Magistrates pertaining to trials and convictions of Aboriginal people under their jurisdiction. It introduced employment contracts between employers and Aboriginal workers over the age of 14. There was no provision in the 1886 WA Act for contracts to include wages. However, employees were to be provided with "substantial, good and sufficient rations," clothing and blankets. The 1886 WA Act provided a Resident Magistrate with the power to indenture 'half-caste' and Aboriginal children, from a suitable age, until they turned 21. An Aboriginal Protection Board, was also established to prevent the abuses reported earlier, but rather than protect Aborigines, it mainly succeeded in putting them under tighter government control. It was intended to enforce contracts, employment of prisoners and apprenticeships, but there was not sufficient power to enforce clauses in the north, and they were openly flouted. The Act defined as "Aboriginal" "every Aboriginal native of Australia, every Aboriginal half-caste, or child of a half-caste". Governor Broome insisted that the act contain within it a clause permitting traditional owners to continue hunting on their tribal lands. The effect of the Act was to give increasing power to the Board over Aboriginal people, rather than setting up a system to punish whites for wrongdoing in relation to Aboriginal people. An Aboriginal Department was set up, under the office of the Chief Protector of Aborigines. Nearly half of the Legislative Council voted to amend the act for contract labour as low as 10 but it was defeated. Mackenzie Grant, the member for the north claimed that child labour of 6 or 7 was a necessary commonplace, as "in this way they gradually become domesticated."  The Atourney General Septimus Burt, in debate on the 2nd reading speech, claimed that contracts were being issued, not for current work, but to hold Aboriginal people as slaves on stations for potential future work, and so prevent them from being free to leave.
* ''1886'' dealings with "natives" in Western Australia had been the responsibility of the British [[Colonial Office]]. In 1886 an Aboriginal Protection Board was established with five members and a secretary, all of whom were nominated by the Governor. Protectors of Aborigines were appointed by the board under the conditions laid down in the ''[[Western Australian Aborigines Protection Act|Aborigines Protection Act]]'' of 1886. In theory, Protectors of Aborigines were empowered to undertake legal proceedings on behalf of Aboriginal people. As the board had very limited funds Protectors received very limited remuneration, and so a range of people were appointed as local Protectors, including Resident Magistrates, Jail Wardens, Justices of the Peace and in some cases ministers of religion, though most were local Police Inspectors.

* ''1893'' ''[[1893 Education Act of Western Australia|Education Act]]'' of Western Australia gave white parents the power to object to any Aboriginal child attending any school also attended by their children, a provision which saw Aboriginal children progressively and completely excluded from the state education system.
* ''1896'' John Forest, Premier of Western Australia, unilaterally breaks the Western Australia Constitution Act 1890 (U.K.) , granting self government to Western Australia, by taking control of Aboriginal Affairs from the British House of Commons, and which sliced funding below the 1% of government funds earmarked for Aboriginal Affairs in the WA Constitution.
* ''1897'', as part of the Western Australian Government's attempt to gain control of Aboriginal Affairs, which had been under the Constitution of Western Australia vested in reserve under the Colonial Office, the Aborigines Department was set up as a result of the ''Aborigines Act'' 1897, which had abolished the Aborigines Protection Board. The Department operated as a sub-department of the Treasury, with a very small staff under the Chief Protector of Aborigines. Repeated cuts in finances for the operating budget of the Aborigines Department, partly resulting from the 1905 Aborigines Act, saw this department merged in 1909 to form the Department of Aborigines and Fisheries.
* ''1899'' Report to the Protector of Aborigines showed that there were 67 children at Beagle Bay mission who were 'nourished and instructed' and 'have created a want of civilised food' and other practices that helped them, in the belief of the missionaries, give up the 'savage' way of life.
* ''1901'' The Pallotines became involved in running the Beagle Bay Mission as part of the Catholic Diocese of Broome.  and from 1972 the head of the departments for child welfare was the guardian of any children deemed to be 'native wards' or 'wards of the State'. In 1976, Beagle Bay became a self-governing community.
* ''1904'' ''Royal Commission on the Administration of Aborigines and the Condition of the Natives'' chaired by Dr Walter Edmund Roth (1861–1933), Chief Protector of Aborigines in Queensland, was conducted in 1904, and discussed the growing "half-caste problem".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.findandconnect.gov.au/ref/wa/biogs/WE00406b.htm accessed 28/4/2006&lt;/ref&gt; Most Aborigines were living in regional areas, where sexual exploitation of Aboriginal women by whites led to an increasing number of "degenerate" mixed race children who were subsequently abandoned by their fathers. It led in 1905 to a new Act which extended the definition of Aboriginal to all half caste children and made all Aboriginal persons as wards of the state with the Chief Protector of Aborigines made legal guardian in place of the parents, with powers to remove children from their parents care and place them in custodial situations.
:The Honourable J.M. Drew stated
:&lt;blockquote&gt;I think it is our duty not to allow these children, whose blood is half-British, to grow up as vagrants and outcasts, as their mothers are now. There is a large number of absolutely worthless black and half-castes about who grow up to lives of prostitution and idleness; they are a perfect nuisance; if they were taken away from their surroundings of temptation much good might be done with them. There is no power to do this now, consequently a half – caste who possesses few of the virtues and nearly all the vices of whites, grows up to be a mischievous and very immoral subject. This Bill will tend, in a great measure, to remedy this abuse. I may say it may appear to be a cruel thing to tear away an Aborigine child from its mother, but it is necessary in some cases to be cruel to be kind.&lt;ref&gt;Western Australian Hansard 1897&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* ''April 2006'' Prinsep confirmed as Protector of Aborigines.
* ''1908'' Bernier and Dorre Islands were used for the isolation and treatment of Aboriginal people from north Western Australia believed to be suffering from venereal disease. The Lock Hospitals were established with female patients residing in an existing house on Bernier Island, and accommodation for males being built near White Beach on Dorre Island. It seems that the patients and their families often had little idea of where or why they were taken. Patients were kept on the islands until they were cured or died. Those who were fit enough hunted game, fished and worked to establish and maintain the hospitals. Remnants of the hospital buildings and artefacts from this era still remain on the islands.
* ''1 January 1909'', creation of the Department of Aborigines and Fisheries.  Aboriginal people were considered as part of the protected flora and fauna of Western Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Find and Connect: History and Information About Australian Children's Orphanages.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''1910'' Daisy Bates visits Bernier and Dore Islands and describes the hospitals as "tombs of the living dead."
* ''1911'' ''[[Aborigines Act Amendment Act]]'' significantly extended the Protector's guardianship power to remove Aboriginal children to the 'exclusion of the rights of the mother of an illegitimate or half caste child'. In that year 200 Aboriginal people had camped on the fringes of [[Katanning]], in order to allow their children to get an education, but under the powers of the 1893 Education Act, parents in 1914 demanded that Aboriginal children be excluded from their school, and in 1915 the Katanning white community, acting on its own, had local police remove the Aboriginal [[fringe dwellers]] to what was the equivalent of a [[concentration camp]] at [[Carrolup]].
* ''1913'' Admissions decrease on Bernier and Dore Island due to increased costs.
* ''1915'', the appointment of [[A. O. Neville]] as Protector of Aborigines saw a change in policy. He saw the Aboriginal population of Western Australia as comprising two groups:
:* [[Full blood Aborigines]], who were to be segregated from the community in order that they could become extinct.
:* [[Half-caste Aborigines]], who were to be assimilated through intermarriage within the white community as quickly as possible.
* ''1918'' Bernier and Dore Islands abandoned and the hospitals were closed and the patients and buildings relocated to Port Hedland. Hospital records were poorly kept so exact figures cannot be ascertained, but more than 700 patients were admitted of whom close to 200 died on the islands.
* ''1922'' in interests of economy and expediency the Carrolup River Native Settlement was shut and inmates transferred to [[Moore River Native Settlement]] near [[Moora]], and the Carrolup land taken over by local farmers.
* ''1927'' A.O.Neville under the provisions of the 1905 Act makes the area of Central Perth a prohibited area of five square kilometres in the centre of Perth, in order to discourage Noongars from loitering and  gathering in large numbers. Noongars who worked in the city and within the prohibited area were required to carry identification and a pass. As there was also a night curfew, Noongars had to have permits to travel after 6pm. It stayed in place until 1953.
* ''1934'' The Moseley Royal Commission heard evidence in 1934 that the Moore River Native Settlement a 'woeful spectacle', buildings over-crowded (by at least 50%), buildings and clothing was vermin ridden, there was no vocational training except for the chores given by staff, the diet lacked all fresh fruit, vegetables, eggs, milk, and health of inmates was seriously affected. Solitary confinement imprisonment of children in the "Boob" was stated to be barbarous and must be stopped. The Commission ruled that in its present condition it had 'no hope of success' with the children in its care.
* ''1936'' Commissioner for Native Affairs replaces Protector of Aborigines, but the Commissioner continued the legal authority granted by the Aborigines Act 1905.
* ''16th July 1937'' Birth of Vivienne Sahanna, nee Corbett, at the Moore River Native Settlement.
:Nevertheless Neville continued in his role as Chief Protector to argue before the [[Moseley Royal Commission]] of 1934 for an extension of his powers, and despite some opposition to this the commission agreed to support his recommendation. In 1936 Sections 8 and 12 of the new ''[[Native Administration Act]]'' the Chief Protector's guardianship powers were increased still further by a new definition of "native child" to mean any child with any Aboriginal descent, and further widened the scope of the Chief Protector's guardianship and therefore jurisdiction over all Aboriginal people in Western Australia.
* ''1940s – 1970s'' Roelands Mission at [[Roelands]], outside of Bunbury, ran as a centre for up to 500 children of Aboriginal descent removed from their parents under the policies now called [[Stolen Generations]]. Amongst those involved were Sidney Jackson (ex-VFL/AFL Carlton player), Phil Prosser (ex-Army Duntroon graduate) and Dorothy Pilkington (Follow the Rabbit Proof Fence).
* ''1941'' Thirty De Grey Aboriginal station men successfully struck over poor food. Quality of food was improved as a result.
* ''1942'' Secret Meeting of Aborigines at Skull Springs in the Pilbara, attended by groups from all over the Pilbara, concerned at threats to traditional life. The elders invited Don McLeod, a 40-year-old white Australian, born at [[Meekathara]] who had defended Aboriginal rights at Port Hedland, to the meeting. Strike action was urged, followed by 6 weeks of further negotiations, before agreement was reached. Dooley Bin-Bin, a 44-year-old Nyandamada tribesman, and 36-year-old Clancy McKenna, together with McLeod secretly met with Aboriginal communities throughout the Pilbara. Strike action was deferred until after the war so as not to be unpatriotic.&lt;ref name="Broome_141_142"&gt;{{harvp|Broome|2010|pp=141–142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1943 to the Mabo case of 1992==

This period began with the [[1946 Pilbara strike|Great Stockman's Strike of 1946]]. It, like the other periods, can be divided into two by the events of 1967, in which Aboriginal people were recognised as Australian, and by the passage of the [[Racial Discrimination Act 1975]], which for the first time since 1829 recognised Aboriginal people as equal under Australian law. The passing of the Mabo and Wik High Court Decisions, which recognised Aboriginal people as in possession of the land at the date of European settlement, is an appendix to these changes. This period is still not complete, as the Western Australian Labor and Liberal Coalition governments are still resisting the Native Title claim of the Noongar people.

*''5 May 1946'' After having been leeked to the white community, who basically dismissed the idea as impossible, the stockman´s strike broke out on 20 of the 22 Pilbara stations. The strikers demanded 30 shillings weekly plus better board and keep. Local owners and Perth press were enraged, blaming communist agitators, unbelieving that Aborigines were capable of planning this themselves. Strikers supported themselves living off the land, running cattle and mining for minerals. Reclaiming land and making culture strong was to follow. Dooley was arrested at Marble Bar whilst workers were mining tin with their wooden "yandi" bowls. Led away to [[Port Hedland]] and charged with ensiting Aboriginal people from the white in neck chains he called "It was in yandi that our mothers carried us. Now the yandi carries us again - keep working."  McKenna and McLeod were arrested, McLeod`s bail was set over $600, higher than a years salary&lt;ref name="Broome_141_142"/&gt;
* ''1947'' - The New Coolbaroo League&lt;ref name="noongarculture"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noongarculture.org.au/contact-history/coolbaroo-league.aspx|publisher=noongarculture.org.au|title=contact-history/coolbaroo-league|accessdate=10 April 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121129224226/http://www.noongarculture.org.au/contact-history/coolbaroo-league.aspx|archivedate=29 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded by the young activist, Helena Clarke from Port Hedland, Yamatji brothers Jack and Bill Poland, and their wadjela friend, Geoff Harcus, aims to begin [[lobbying]] to allow Aborigines to legally begin living in Perth once again. Taking its name from the [[Yamatji]] word for Magpie it was a hope for reconciliation between black and white. Helena Murphy (née Clarke), a founding member, saw it as representing identity and people of mixed ancestry; while others felt it expressed a desire for collaboration and change. The Coolbaroo League became part of a wider movement for Aboriginal rights. It raised awareness of issues affecting Aboriginal people, including the restricted entry for Noongars into the inner city.
* ''1949'' The police were upset with the full jails of the strikers, and being used politically. Mount Edgar Agreement offers Aborigines unequal wages at $6 weekly, but few strikers returned to the stations. It was clear that Aborigines wanted freedom from Aboriginal semi-slave labour conditions. 600 Aborigines formed their own mining company.
* ''1950'' – and following years. Attempts were made to evacuate the last traditional Aboriginal people from the Western Desert in order to clear the area for British [[Blue Streak (missile)|Blue Streak]] missile testing from the [[Woomera Rocket Range]]. Government attempts to oppose a private member's bill extending [[citizenship]] to children of Aboriginal citizens.
* ''1951'' The citizenship clause of Aborigines was amended so that they now had to get approval of both a magistrate and a representative of the local municipality, reducing the chances for Aborigines to become citizens. The Korean War minerals boom brings prosperity to Aborigines on strike in the north west. Their Mining Company grossed $100,000 and With these profits Aboriginal strikers were able to purchase five stations centred upon Yandereena. This is the first new land owned by Aborigines since before 1911. A hospital, school and accommodation for the aged is established by the first self-determinating Aboriginal group since Katanning. [[Don McLeod]] enters into partnership with the Adelaide syndicate Western [[Tungsten|Wolfram]] and then the world prices fell.

:Nedlands Road Board, without warning sends a bulldozer and destroys the Swanbourne Aboriginal campsite, without replacing homes for the displaced.  no-one complained and the media reports applauded the Road Board action.

:More than 50% of Kimberley population is found to have [[trachoma]] to some extent.

* ''January 1952'' A new Native Welfare Council is formed with branches in country towns. With the support and covert assistance of Middleton, to extend citizenship to all Aboriginal people.
* ''1953'' The [[Coolbaroo League]] publishes its first bi-monthly newspaper, [[Westralian Aborigine]]. It offered an alternative to the mainstream press and was significant in that it had Aboriginal editorial control and gave a voice to [[Noongar]] people. The paper had some 600 subscribers. The Coolbaroo dances were advertised there, as well as jobs. Sometimes, you could just be looking for a person you'd not seen in a while.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Haebich|2008|p=280}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''April 1954'' [[Queen Elizabeth II]] in her tour of Western Australia "crowns" David Beaufort's lineal descendant as "king of the Bibulmun"
* ''1954'' A new ''[[Native Welfare Act]]'' in 1954 did nothing to limit these removal powers under the 1936 Act, which continued unabated. However amendments to the ''Native Welfare Act'' in 1963 repealed all previous legislation and abolished the Chief Protector's powers to remove children of Aboriginal descent from their biological parents. Nevertheless, the removal of Aboriginal children continued under the arbitrary implementation of the broad provisions of the [[Child Welfare Act]] of 1947. The prohibited area was finally abandoned in 1954, when the Coolbaroo League was allowed to hold a ball at the [[Perth Town Hall]].
* ''1962'' Frank Ellis Gare was Commissioner for Native Welfare from 1962 to 1972.
* ''1963'' Native Welfare Act repeals the 1905 Aborigines Act, but the ability to remove Aboriginal children from their families (i.e the Stolen Generations Policy) remains in force.
* ''1964'' As a result of the Blue Streak Missile Testing, Patrol Officers discovered a large group of woman and children living a traditional life in the area of Lake Disappointment. They are "brought in" and settled at [[Jigalong]].  See the movie ''"Contact"'' for details of the story.
* ''1972'' a departmental reorganisation resulted in the functions of the then [[Native Welfare Department]] being split between two new Departments, the [[Aboriginal Affairs Planning Authority]] (AAPA) and the [[Department of Community Welfare]] (now the [[Department for Community Development]]), responsible for the care and placement of Aboriginal children in the welfare sector. The role of Commissioner ended with the creation of the Department of Community Welfare in 1972.  The creation of the AAPA led to the end of the "[[Stolen Generation]]" as for the first time policies were enacted which allowed children of Aboriginal descent, considered at risk of neglect, to be fostered first and foremost by other members of their families. In this way, a century of acute suffering finally came to an end, leaving a legacy of extensive cultural [[genocide]] of Aboriginal groups south of the 26th parallel.
* ''1980'' Aboriginal Treaty Support Group formed in Western Australia, which ran for three years, until the election of the Burke Labor government which was committed to land rights. 
* ''1981'' Australian Democrat Senator Colin Mason agrees to present a private members bill for Aboriginal land rights in Western Australia, and a first draft prepared by a party member in Perth is reviewed by parliamentary counsel.
* ''1984'' Burke government puts through an Aboriginal Land bill supported by a variety of interest groups after extensive consultation, but it is defeated by two National Party votes in the Legislative Council.
* ''16 October 1987'' Prime Minister [[Robert Hawke]] launched the [[James Muirhead|Muirhead]] [[Royal Commission]] Inquiry into Deaths in Custody which found Western Australia had the greatest number of cases to be heard, with 36 deaths being reported to the Commission. Of those, 32 were found to be within jurisdiction and reported upon.
* ''28 June 1988'' with the hearing into the death of Charles Michael. Due to the enormity of the task in Western Australia with the number of deaths to be investigated and size of the State, it was decided that another Commissioner was needed to assist with the conduct of inquiries in this State.
* ''27 October 1988'' Commonwealth Letters Patent issued to conduct inquiries into the deaths of Aboriginals who had died in custody in Western Australia and elsewhere in Australia as directed by Commissioner Muirhead.
* ''30 May 1989'' Presentation of the [[Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody]]. Very many of the recommendations were never implemented, leading to a continuation of the problem of Aboriginal deaths in custody.
* ''3 June 1992'', The Ruling of the Australian Supreme Court, under Justice [[Gerard Brennan]], in the case Eddie [[Mabo v Queensland (No 2)|Mabo]] versus the state of Queensland (2) accepts for the first time in Australian history that Indigenous people do have legal rights to land in Australia, and that the legal ruling [[terra nullius]] was not a legal situation.

==1992 Year of Indigenous Peoples - present==
* ''10 December 1992'' In launching the International Year of Indigenous Peoples, Prime Minister [[Paul Keating]] in his [[Redfern Address]] stated "It was we who did the dispossessing. We took the traditional lands and smashed the traditional way of life. We brought the diseases. The alcohol. We committed the murders. We took the children from their mothers. We practised discrimination and exclusion. It was our ignorance and our prejudice. And our failure to imagine these things being done to us."
* ''October 1994'' the Federal Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. addressing the Going Home Conference in Darwin, announced he would be writing to Michael Levarch, the Attorney-General, with the suggestion that the Equal Rights and Opportunities Commission investigate why thousands of Aboriginal children had been separated from their families and communities in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Mann|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''1994'' Australian Bureau of Statistics finds that 10.1% of aboriginals aged between twenty five years of age and 44 years of age had been separated from their families, and 10.6% of those aged more than 44 had suffered the same.
* ''1 June 1995'' Formation of the [[Indigenous Land Corporation]], a Commonwealth statutory authority with national responsibilities to assist Indigenous peoples to acquire land and to manage Indigenous-held land. The ILC has a seven-member board, appointed by the Minister for Indigenous Affairs. The Chairperson and at least four other members of the Board must be Indigenous. The ILC Board makes all policy and land acquisition decisions, following the Mabo decision and Federal legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilc.gov.au/webdata/resources/files/WhatIsTheILCJly06.pdf Indigenous Land Corporation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071202033117/http://www.ilc.gov.au/webdata/resources/files/WhatIsTheILCJly06.pdf |date=2 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''1996'' inquiry headed by Sir Ronald Wilson, former High Court Judge and President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, and Mick Dodson, Social Justice Commissioner, takes 2 years collecting oral and written evidence across Australia, with assistance of all Australian governments except the [[Howard Government|Howard Commonwealth Government]], which denied them access to Northern Territory records, and refused the inquiry's request for additional funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Mann|2001|pp=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr Eric Hunter conducted a report on Aborigines in the Kimberley and found that one quarter of elderly Aborigines and one in seven of those middle aged had been separated from their families.
* ''December 1996'' the [[Wik Peoples v Queensland|Wik People versus Queensland]] case demonstrates that pastoral agreements do not extinguish native title as established under the Mabo judgement. This in 1998 required modification of the Native Title Tribunal legislation of 1994.
* ''26 May 1997'' The [[Bringing Them Home]] Report also called "Report of the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families", presented to Federal Government, confirms that Aboriginal people from 1910 until the 1970s saw the removal of between one in three to one in ten Aboriginal children who had suffered "gross violation of their human rights" and comprised "an act of genocide, aimed at wiping out Indigenous families, communities and cultures".
* ''June 1997'' Australians for Native Title launch the "Sorry Book" initiative giving ordinary Australians a chance to respond to the failure of the Federal Government to give an unreserved apology under the findings of the Bringing them Home Report. The books became a popular way for ordinary Australians to express their desires for Reconciliation.
* ''6 September 1997'', [[Robert Bropho]] sues cartoonist Dean Acheson of the Western Australian for a cartoon that pointed offensively to the struggle amongst Western Australian Noongars after the return of [[Yagan's head]] to the state.
* ''26 May 1998'' declared "Sorry Day" as an annual day of celebration of reconciliation between Aboriginal communities and non-Indigenous Australians.
* ''6 March 2000'' [[Richard Court]], Premier of Western Australia fails to achieve modification of Native Title Legislation, modelled upon the failed Liberal Federal Government legislation in the Northern Territory, after having spent millions of dollars of tax payers money in an attempt to secure the extinguishment of [[native title]] on pastoral leases in Western Australia, in contravention of the [[Wik Peoples v Queensland|Wik ruling]].

* ''16 September 2006'' The ruling by Supreme Court Judge Wilcox in the Bennell versus Western Australia case, confirms the survival of the [[Noongar]] people and their customary title to lands of the south west corner of Western Australia. "Justice Wilcox found the Noongar community had continued to exist despite the descent system being disrupted through mixed marriage and people being forced off their land and dispersed to other areas as a result of European settlement. Justice Wilcox said families had kept in contact. Many, if not most, children learned at least some Noongar language while traditional skills, beliefs and as much as possible, land laws, had been preserved. As a consequence, Justice Wilcox found there was a case for native title".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,20447424-7583,00.html | work=The Australian | title=Editorial: Taking the fight from native title | date=21 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Labor Party Government of [[Alan Carpenter]] announces that they will appeal against the deal.
* ''14 May 2007'' ABC Lateline program reports graphic details of rampant sexual abuse of Aboriginal children, following from the Roger's report on “Child Sexual Assault and Some Cultural Issues in the Northern Territory.”
* ''21 May 2007'' Report finds that Aboriginal people are "grossly disadvantaged in negotiations with miners because the Native Title Tribunal has failed for more than a decade to exercise its veto over mining leases". As a result, companies have known leases would be granted even if negotiations failed. As a result, Aboriginal groups have been forced to agree to "grossly inadequate compensation packages", because their "hands are tied behind their backs".&lt;ref&gt;"The Australian" Monday 21 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, Aboriginal groups are seriously missing out on the resources boom currently propelling growth in the Australian economy.
* ''31 May 2007'' The Western Australian State Government announces on the 40th Anniversary of the Referendum that it will investigate wages stolen from Aboriginal people. Up to 75% of all Aboriginal Wages paid to Aboriginal people according to provisions of the 1905 Aboriginal Act were held in a Trust Account by state government and never repaid, following the "Stolen Wages" enquiry of the Australian Federal Senate. Brian Wyatt of the Goldfields Land and Sea Council, announces for the Goldfields Region alone the amount could amount to $150&amp;nbsp;million. The NSW Government set up a compensation scheme in 2005, and the Queensland government set up a special compensation fund of $56&amp;nbsp;million in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Perth Independent Media Centre http://perth.indymedia.org/index.php?action=default&amp;featureview=514 – 31k – 7 Jun 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''21 June 2007'' Australia’s Aborigines were stripped of the right of self-rule  after the Government declared the widespread sexual abuse of Aboriginal children to be a national emergency equivalent to the [[Katrina Hurricane]] in the USA. John Howard, the Prime Minister, banned the sale of alcohol across an area the size of France and imposed restrictions on access to pornography. He also announced tight controls on welfare benefits, which will be cut if children fail to attend school. Aboriginal families will be required to spend at least half their fortnightly welfare on food and essentials.
* ''25 July 2007'' The Federal Government Minister of Aboriginal Affairs [[Mal Brough]] announces his intention to abolish the Community Development Employment Program, a "work for the dole scheme" which enabled Aboriginal people in many remote areas to obtain work working in not-for-profit Aboriginal-run organisations providing subsidised services to remote Aboriginal communities, not provided by conventional government or industry. As this is the major source of employment for these areas, unemployment in remote Aboriginal communities is likely to rise from 30% to over 50%, and the quality of life experienced by people living in such centres is expected to fall.
* ''5 August 2007'' The high rate of suicide in indigenous communities in Western Australia will be scrutinised by the State Coroner, Alastair Hope. The ABC reported the coordinator of the Kimberley Aboriginal Law and Culture Centre, Wes Morris, says there was a recent public meeting of 180 residents concerned about the high number of suicides. "In addition to the suicides there is also the large number of accidental deaths and we know that one of the root causes of both the suicides and the accidental deaths is the high rate of alcohol use in this community," he said. "There's absolute despair in the community. There's so many families within the community who have been affected in such a deep and personal way."&lt;ref name="abc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/08/08/1999331.htm|publisher=abc.net.au|title=Coroner to investigate high suicide rate in Aboriginal communities - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |accessdate=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''14 November 2007'' The Hope Inquest into Aboriginal Deaths in [[Fitzroy Crossing]], held in [[Broome, Western Australia]], is told that the WA Department of Indigenous Affairs lacks a plan for indigenous public housing, drugs, alcohol or life skills in the Kimberley.
* ''26 November 2007'' The election of the [[First Rudd Government|Rudd Labor government]], puts many of the Aboriginal changes foreshadowed by [[John Howard]]'s [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] government on hold. Kevin Rudd indicates that he will give a formal apology to the Aboriginal people for their suffering as a part of the Stolen Generations.
* ''2008'' all Australian governments signed the National Indigenous Reform Agreement (NIRA). NIRA, which is endorsed by the Council of Australian Governments (COAG), included six outcomes-based reform targets for 'Closing the Gap' with
** Close the life expectancy gap by 2031. 
** Halve the child mortality rate by 2018.
** That all four-year-old children in remote areas have access to early childhood education by 2013. 
** Halve the gap in reading, writing and numeracy achievements by 2018. 
** Halve the gap in Year 12 or equivalent attainment by 2020.
** Halve the gap in employment by 2018.
* ''13 February 2008'' Sir William Deane and former Prime Ministers Paul Keating, Bob Hawke, Gough Whitlam and Malcolm Fraser were all seated on the floor of the Parliament to hear Prime Minister Kevin Rudd deliver upon the recommendation of the "Bringing them Home" report, a formal apology on the part of the Australian nation for the suffering inflicted as a result of the stolen generations. Conspicuous by his absence was the former Prime Minister, John Howard.

Despite spending $1.2&amp;nbsp;million a year on the problems, there was a lack of leadership at State and Commonwealth levels and the funding was divided between 22 non-government and government programs. The Aboriginal owned pub at Fitzroy Crossing, has not returned profits to the owners in 18 years (all profits being taken by white managers).

After 3 police raids the tents were removed by WA Police on 22 March.
* ''6 March 2012'' Under past legislation such as the Aborigines Act 1905 and the Native Welfare Act 1963, employers of Aboriginal people, including successive state governments between 1905 and 1972, held 75% of the wages and property belonging to Aboriginal people in a complex network of trust accounts, which was never delivered to them. The Western Australian Government announced that it would recompense each Aboriginal person still living and able to give evidence that entitlements were withheld from them $2,000 for these ''Stolen Wages'', becoming the 3rd Australian state to attempt some reimbursement. Indigenous Affairs Minister [[Peter Collier (politician)|Peter Collier]] said most of the documentation about the accounts and monies held in trust had been lost, along with verification of who was affected and how much was held.&lt;ref&gt;The West Australian Newspaper 6th March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  Payments for Aboriginal victims of Stolen Wages were labelled “an insult” by local Aboriginal businessman and cultural awareness trainer [[Kado Muir]].
* ''21 March 2012'' Kimberley Aboriginal Law and Cultural Centre are campaigning to have the laws repealed, in accordance with a 2006 recommendation by the WA Law Reform Commission, that the 1972 Law that if an Aboriginal Person dies without a will, all assets of that person do not go to family members (as for non Aboriginal deaths), but are taken by the Public Trustee.&lt;ref&gt;The Australian, Nicholas Perpitch" West Australian Aborigines challenge 'racist' law on wills"&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''2014'' COAG agreed to an additional target on school attendance, as a part of the Closing the Gap program, achieve 90 per cent student attendance rates by 2018.
* ''14 March 2015'' After indicating that it was going to close 150, more than half of the 276 Aboriginal settlement communities of Western Australia after the commonwealth government withdrew $30&amp;nbsp;million for the provision of services, the Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, angers aboriginal leaders around the country by calling such settlements on traditional lands a "lifestyle choice" of the residents. A refugee camp established to protest state treatment of Aborigines over many years, on [[Heirisson Island]] is ringed by police after orders from the Perth City Council that the camp is illegal. Tents and bedding of the protesters are stollen.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-03-11/abbott-defends-indigenous-communities-lifestyle-choice/6300218 accessed 14 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''28 April 2015'' Deregistration of the Burrup Peninsula as an Aboriginal Sacred Site, despite the fact that it contains Aboriginal Rock Art going back 50,000 years, and the earliest human portrait in the world.  It is suggested that the deregistration of this and 300 Aboriginal Sacred Sites in Western Australia is revenge by the [[Colin Barnett]] government over its loss of [[James Price Point]] battle in the Kimberley.&lt;ref&gt;https://thewest.com.au/news/pilbara/burrup-peninsula-deregistered-as-sacred-site-ng-ya-203510 sighted 25th April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''6 September 2015'' Calculations of the stolen wages reparation scheme, whereby which 75% of the wages of Aboriginal workers until 1972 were withheld by the state costing $71 million, with up to 3,000 workers. Previously in 2012 the state government claimed that the figure was just $2.5 million, and was offering claimants only $2,000. Peter Collier, Minister for Aboriginal Affairs of the Barnett Government was accused of going slow on the settlement, waiting for claimants to die.&lt;ref&gt;ABC Background Briefing "WA's stolen wages shame"&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''23 September 2015'' Release of progress report on Closing the Gap reports that improvements in infant mortality unlikely to be met, maternal health increased only 2.2% points.  Death rates per 10,000 children aged 0-5 were 69 for non Aboriginal children but 207 for Aboriginal children, and the gap in life expectancy was widening, standing at 65 years for Aboriginal populations (under 60 for Aboriginal men) and over 80 for the non Aboriginal population.  Suicide rates and unemployment rates increased, gaps were widening.&lt;ref&gt;Government of Western Australia (2015)"Progress Against Closing the Gap"&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''6 March 2017'' More than 100 indigenous leaders in Perth throw their support behind calls for a treaty between Aboriginal people and the Federal Government.  Gordon Cole, a co-convenor at the Indigenous Referendum Council, said the 120 delegates from the Murchison, Gascoyne, Goldfields, Pilbara and the South West complained Aboriginal people were not properly represented in Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;The West Australian Kim MacDonald "100 WA Aboriginal leaders call for treaty with Federal Government"&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''26 February 2017'' Both major parties field Aboriginal candidates for election the first time in WA history.  Aboriginal candidate [[Ben Wyatt]] is set to become Western Australian Treasurer, the highest political post ever held by an Aboriginal person in Western Australian history.

In '''United Nations Security Council resolution 505''', adopted unanimously on 26 May 1982, after reaffirming [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 502|Resolution 502]] (1982) and noting that the situation in the region of the [[Falkland Islands]] had seriously deteriorated, the Council expressed appreciation for the Secretary-General [[Javier Pérez de Cuéllar]]'s efforts to bring about a peaceful solution to the conflict.

The resolution went on to urge both [[Argentina]] and the United Kingdom to cooperate with the Secretary-General to achieve a [[ceasefire]] and, if necessary, to arrange a possible dispatch of United Nations observers to the region to monitor the implementation of a ceasefire. The Council concluded by requesting the Secretary-General to submit a report on developments no later than seven days after the implementation of the resolution.

Several days before the adoption of this resolution, [[Peru]] offered a peace proposal which was rejected by Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1665&amp;dat=19820503&amp;id=EWAaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=zSQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5041,129308&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://elcomercio.pe/mundo/actualidad/peru-conflicto-ajeno-nuestra-actuacion-guerra-malvinas-noticia-1395667&lt;/ref&gt; Though not included in the final draft, Argentina wished for Resolution 505 to include a reference to a possible interim administration on the islands, an idea that came up in negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freedman|first=Lawrence|title=The Official History of the Falklands Campaign: War and diplomacy|publisher=Routledge|date=2005|page=526|isbn=978-0-7146-5207-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further draft resolution by [[Panama]] and Spain was [[United Nations Security Council veto power|vetoed]] by Britain and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/05/world/un-resolution-on-falkland-war.html|title=UN resolution on Falkland Islands|date=5 June 1982|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Uriel's Machine: The Prehistoric Technology That Survived the Flood''''' is a bestselling book published in 1999 by [[Christopher Knight (author)|Christopher Knight]] and [[Robert Lomas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Books: Best-sellers|work=[[The Independent]]|location=London|date=11 July 1999|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book's name is derived from a character of the same name in the ''[[Book of Enoch]]''.  In Knight and Lomas's interpretation of the ''Book of Enoch'', [[Uriel]] warns [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]] about the impending [[Deluge (mythology)|flood]], giving him instructions for building a form of solar observatory for the purpose of preserving advanced knowledge into a time of global disaster by teaching him the movement of the Sun against the horizon over a period of time, which Enoch then records in detail in the ''[[Book of Enoch#The Astronomical Book|Book of the Courses of the Heavenly Luminaries]]''.

== Summary ==
In [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] mythology there are many references to seven, which the authors speculate could refer to seven cometary fragments. These seven cometary fragments are described in the book as hitting the earth in prehistory causing [[tsunami]]s. The authors link this speculation to [[Tollmann's hypothetical bolide|the work of geologists Edith and Alexander Tollmann]].&lt;ref name="Kristan-TollmannOthers1994"&gt;Kristan-Tollmann, E. and A. Tollmann, 1994, ''The youngest big impact on Earth deduced from geological and historical evidence''. Terra Nova. v. 6, no. 2, pp. 209-217.&lt;/ref&gt; Their work proposes a series of meteors hitting the earth over the last 10,000 years, especially circa 7640 BC. Their evidence and counter-evidence is discussed in the article [[Tollmann's hypothetical bolide]].

The book proposes that what the authors believe to have been stellar observatories (such as the first wooden [[Stonehenge]]) in Britain, and structures in the [[Boyne Valley]] in Ireland, show sufficient knowledge to be able to predict prescribed solar, lunar and venusian events and cycles, such as solstices and equinoxes. If rituals at Stonehenge involved stargazing, there is then the opportunity for an anomalous object to be spotted far more quickly if the cycles of observed celestial objects are known.

The authors quote textual evidence from the [[book of Enoch]], noting other coincidences made between Enoch and astronomy; for example, it is said he lived 365 years, which could be a reference to a year (365.25 days).
 
The authors suggest that chambers ([[souterrain]]s) found in Britain might have been attempts to build shelters to be sealed against [[tsunamis]] that would have been caused by a cometary impact in the sea. However, the souterrains have been dated to the late Iron Age, thousands of years after the supposed impact event.

Archaeologists and astronomers have been extremely sceptical about this idea. Prof Archie Roy (an astronomer and psychic researcher) and [[Robert Lomas]] gave a joint talk about technological possibilities in Megalithic society at the 2000 Orkney International Science.

== Critical response ==
[[Tim Schadla-Hall]], archaeologist and editor of the journal ''[[Public Archaeology]]'', has cited the book as an example of [[pseudoscience]], in which the authors "quote established academics in such a way as to make it seem as though they support their arguments".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=The comforts of unreason: the importance and relevance of alternative archaeology|editor-last=Merriman|editor-first=Nick|title=Public Archaeology|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=London|date=2004|page=260|isbn=9780415258890}}&lt;/ref&gt; The geology in the book is based on [[Tollmann's hypothetical bolide]] which has been rejected by specialists in [[meteorite]] and [[comet]] impacts.&lt;ref name="DeutschOthers1993"&gt;Deutsch, A., C.

Terra Nova. v. 6, pp. 644-650.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Tonkin, author and astronomer, said: "I believe that the astronomical basis of this book is sufficiently flawed as to render any conclusions that the authors draw from it to be highly suspect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tonkin|first=Stephen|date=2003|url=http://astunit.com/astrocrud.php?topic=uriel|title=Uriel's Machine – a Commentary on some of the Astronomical Assertions|work=The Astronomical Unit|accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mike Pitts (archaeologist)|Mike Pitts]], archaeologist and journalist, says that the book contains "what we might politely call a radically alternative approach to Grooved Ware pottery" and notes that the book's bibliography contains "such items as Myths and Legends of Australia, Robert the Bruce ''and'' The Pleistocene Elephants of Siberia, but not a single primary archaeological source for England (where, it has to be said, a great deal of Grooved Ware has been found)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pitts|first=Mike|authorlink=Mike Pitts (archaeologist)|date=2000|title=Hengeworld|publisher=[[Random House|Century]]|location=London|isbn=9780099278757}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vuk Stefanović Karadžić''' ({{IPA-sh|ʋûːk stefǎːnoʋitɕ kâradʒitɕ|pron}}, {{lang-sr-cyr|Вук Стефановић Караџић}}; 7 November 1787{{snd}}7 February 1864) was a [[Serbs|Serb]] [[philology|philologist]] and [[linguistics|linguist]] who was the major reformer of the [[Serbian language]]. He deserves, perhaps, for his collections of songs, fairy tales, and riddles, to be called the father of the study of [[Serbian folklore]]. He was also the author of the first Serbian dictionary in the new reformed language. In addition, he translated the [[New Testament]] into the reformed form of the Serbian spelling and language.

He was well known abroad and familiar to [[Jacob Grimm]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] and historian [[Leopold von Ranke]]. Vuk was the [[primary source]] for Ranke's ''Serbische Revoluzion'' ("[[Serbian revolution|Serbian Revolution]]"), written in 1829.

==Biography==

===Early life===
[[Image:Vuk´s house today.JPG|thumb|150px|left|Vuk Karadžić's house today in the all-museum village [[Tršić, Serbia|Tršić]].]]
Vuk Karadžić was born to parents Stefan and Jegda (née ''Zrnić'') in the village of [[Tršić, Serbia|Tršić]], near [[Loznica]], which was in the [[Ottoman Empire]] (now in [[Serbia]]). His family settled from [[Drobnjaci]], and his mother was born in [[Ozrinići]], [[Nikšić]] (in present-day [[Montenegro]].) His family had a low infant survival rate, thus he was named Vuk ('wolf') so that witches and evil spirits would not hurt him (the name was traditionally given to strengthen the bearer).

===Education===
[[File:Вук Стефановић Караџић.1816.jpg|thumb|Oil painting by [[Pavel Đurković]], dating to 1816 (age 29)]]
Karadžić was fortunate to be a relative of Jevta Savić Čotrić, the only literate person in the area at the time, who taught him how to read and write. Karadžić continued his education in the [[Tronoša Monastery]] in Loznica. As a boy he learned [[calligraphy]] there, using a reed instead of a pen and a solution of gunpowder for ink. In lieu of proper writing paper he was lucky if he could get cartridge wrappings. Throughout the whole region, regular schooling was not widespread at that time and his father at first did not allow him to go to Austria. Since most of the time while in the monastery Karadžić was forced to pasture the livestock instead of studying, his father brought him back home. Meanwhile, the [[First Serbian Uprising]] seeking to overthrow the Ottomans began in 1804. After unsuccessful attempts to enroll in the [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] at [[Sremski Karlovci]], for which 19-year-old Karadžić was too old, Karadžić left for [[Petrinja]] where he spent a few months learning Latin and German. Later on, he left for [[Belgrade]], now in the hands of the [[Revolutionary Serbia]], in order to meet the highly respected scholar [[Dositej Obradović]], and ask him to support his studies. Unfortunately, Obradović dismissed him. Disappointed, Karadžić left for [[Jadar (Serbia)|Jadar]] and began working as a scribe for [[Jakov Nenadović]]. After the founding of the [[Belgrade Higher School]], Karadžić became one of its first students.

===Later life and death===
Soon afterwards, he grew ill and left for medical treatment in [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]] and [[Novi Sad]], but was unable to receive treatment for his leg. It was rumored that Karadžić deliberately refused to undergo amputation, instead deciding to make do with a [[prosthetic]] wooden [[pegleg]], of which there were several sarcastic references in some of his works.{{clarify|reason=If his leg was not amputated, how could he have a prosthetic one?|date=November 2015}} Karadžić returned to Serbia by 1810, and as unfit for military service, he served as the secretary for commanders [[Đorđe Ćurčija|Ćurčija]] and [[Hajduk-Veljko]]. His experiences would later give rise to two books. With the Ottoman defeat of the Serbian rebels in 1813, he left for [[Vienna]] and later met [[Jernej Kopitar]], an experienced linguist with a strong interest in secular [[slavistics]]. Kopitar's influence helped Karadžić with his struggle in reforming the [[Serbian language]] and its orthography. Another important influence was [[Sava Mrkalj]].

In 1814 and 1815, Karadžić published two volumes of ''Serbian Folk Songs'', which afterwards increased to four, then to six, and finally to nine tomes. In enlarged editions, these admirable songs drew towards themselves the attention of all literary Europe and America. [[Goethe]] characterized some of them as "excellent and worthy of comparison with Solomon's ''Song of Songs''."

In 1824, he sent a copy of his folksong collection to [[Jacob Grimm]], who was enthralled particularly by [[The Building of Skadar]] which Karadžić recorded from singing of [[Old Rashko]]. Grimm translated it into German and the song was noted and admired for many generations to come.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Dundes|title=The Walled-Up Wife: A Casebook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MDmGX5y40IwC&amp;pg=PA3|year=1996|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-15073-0|pages=3–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grimm compared them with the noblest flowers of [[Homer]]ic poetry, and of ''The Building of Skadar'' he said: "''one of the most touching poems of all nations and all times.''" The founders of the Romantic School in France, [[Charles Nodier]], [[Prosper Mérimée]], [[Lamartine]], [[Gerard de Nerval]], and [[Claude Fauriel]] translated a goodly number of them, and they also attracted the attention of Russian [[Alexander Pushkin]], Finnish national poet [[Johan Ludwig Runeberg]], Czech Samuel Roznay, Pole [[Kazimierz Brodzinski]], English writers [[Walter Scott]], [[Owen Meredith]], and [[John Bowring]], among others.

Karadžić continued collecting song well into the 1830s. He arrived in Montenegro in the fall of 1834. Infirm, he descended to the [[Bay of Kotor]] to winter there, and returned in the spring of 1835. It was there that Karadžić met [[Vuk Vrčević]], an aspiring littérateur, born in [[Risan]]. From then on Vrčević became Karadžić's faithful and loyal collaborator who collected folk songs and tales and sent them to his address in Vienna for many years to come. Another equally diligent collaborator of Vuk Karadžić was another namesake from Boka Kotorska the Priest Vuk Popović. Both Vrčević and Popović were steadily and unselfishly involved in the gathering of the ethnographic, folklore and lexical material for Karadžić. Later, other collaborators joined Karadžić, including [[Milan Đ. Milićević]].
 [[File:Vukov spomenik.JPG|thumb|Monument to Vuk Karadžić, [[Belgrade]].]]
The majority of Karadžić's works were banned from publishing in Serbia and Austria during the rule of Prince [[Miloš Obrenović I, Prince of Serbia|Miloš Obrenović]]. As observed from a political point of view, Obrenović saw the works of Karadžić as a potential hazard due to a number of apparent reasons, one of which was the possibility that the content of some of the works, although purely poetic in nature, was capable of creating a certain sense of patriotism and a desire for freedom and independence, which very likely might have driven the populace to take up arms against the Turks. This, in turn, would prove detrimental to Prince Miloš's politics toward the Ottoman Empire, with whom he had recently forged an uneasy peace. In Montenegro, however, Njegoš's printing press operated without the archaic letter known as the "[[hard sign]]". Prince Miloš was to resent Njegoš's abandonment of the hard sign, over which, at that time, furious intellectual battles were being waged, with ecclesiastical hierarchy involved as well. Karadžić's works, however, did receive high praise and recognition elsewhere, especially in Russia. In addition to this, Karadžić was granted a full pension from the Tsar in 1826.

He died in Vienna, and was survived by his daughter [[Mina Karadžić]], who was a painter and writer, and by his son Dimitrije Karadžić, a military officer. His remains were relocated to Belgrade in 1897 and buried with great honours next to the grave of [[Dositej Obradović]], in front of [[St. Michael's Cathedral (Belgrade)]].

==Work==

===Linguistic reforms===
[[File:1836 pre-reform Serbian transcript.png|thumb|Transcript of a hand-written debt note written in Sarajevo 1836, an example of pre-reform Serbian vernacular writing. Note that the three witnesses in the end of the letter each use their own spelling standards.]]
Karadžić reformed the Serbian literary language and standardised the [[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet]] by following strict [[Phoneme|phonemic]] principles on the [[Johann Christoph Adelung]]' model and [[Jan Hus]]' [[Czech alphabet]]. Karadžić's reforms of the Serbian literary language modernised it and distanced it from Serbian and Russian [[Church Slavonic]], instead bringing it closer to common folk speech, specifically, to the dialect of Eastern [[Herzegovina]] which he spoke. Karadžić was, together with [[Đuro Daničić]], the main Serbian signatory to the [[Vienna Literary Agreement]] of 1850 which, encouraged by [[Austria]]n authorities, laid the foundation for the Serbian language. Karadžić also translated the [[New Testament]] into Serbian, which was published in 1868. The Vukovian effort of language standardization lasted the remainder of the century. Before then the Serbs had achieved a fully independent state (1878), and a flourishing national culture based in Belgrade and Novi Sad. Despite the Vienna agreement, the Serbs had by this time developed an [[Ekavian accent|Ekavian pronunciation]], which was the native speech of their two cultural capitals as well as the great majority of the Serbian population.

===Literature===
In addition to his linguistic reforms, Karadžić also contributed to folk literature, using peasant culture as the foundation.  Because of his peasant upbringing, he closely associated with the oral literature of the peasants, compiling it to use in his collection of folk songs, tales, and proverbs.  While Karadžić hardly considered peasant life romantic, he regarded it as an integral part of Serbian culture.  He collected several volumes of folk prose and poetry, including a book of over 100 lyrical and epic songs learned as a child and written down from memory.  He also published the first dictionary of vernacular Serbian. For his work he received little financial aid, at times living in poverty, though in the very last 9 years he did receive a pension from [[prince]] [[Miloš Obrenović]]. In some cases Karadžić hid the fact that he had not only collected folk poetry by recording the oral literature but transcribed it from manuscript songbooks of other collectors from [[Srem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Prilozi za književnost, jezik, istoriju i folklor|year=1965|publisher=Државна штампарија Краљевине Срба, Хрвата и Словенаца|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CnpHAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22%D1%81%D1%80%D0%B1%D0%B8+%D1%83+%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%82%D1%83%22&amp;dq=%22%D1%81%D1%80%D0%B1%D0%B8+%D1%83+%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%82%D1%83%22|accessdate=19 January 2012|page=264|language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-philological work===
Besides his greatest achievement on literary field, Karadžić gave his contribution to Serbian anthropology in combination with the ethnography of that time.
He left notes on physical aspects of the human body alongside his ethnographic notes. He introduced a rich terminology on body parts (from head to toes) into the literary language. It should be mentioned that these terms are still used, both in science and everyday speech. He gave, among other things, his own interpretation of the connection between environment and inhabitants, with parts on nourishment, living conditions, hygiene, diseases and funeral customs. All in all this considerable contribution of Vuk Karadžić is not that famous or studied.

==Recognition and legacy==
[[File:Vuk Karadzic Kriehuber cropped.jpg|thumb|Vuk Karadžić, [[lithography]] by [[Josef Kriehuber]], 1865]]
[[File:Diploma Vuku Karadžiću za počasnog građana Zagreba 1861.jpg|thumb|A diploma given to Vuk Karadžić, making him the honorary citizen of Zagreb, 1861.]]

Literary historian [[Jovan Deretić]] summarized his work as "During his fifty years of tireless activity, he accomplished as much as an entire academy of sciences.".&lt;ref name="BataldenCann2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stephen K. Batalden|author2=Kathleen Cann|author3=John Dean|title=Sowing the Word: The Cultural Impact of the British and Foreign Bible Society, 1804-2004|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q0HBN4770MQC&amp;pg=PA253|year=2004|publisher=Sheffield Phoenix Press|isbn=978-1-905048-08-3|pages=253–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karadžić was honored across Europe. He was chosen as a member of various European learned societies, including:

*Member of academy in [[Berlin]]
*Member of academy in [[Vienna]]
*Member of academy in [[Saint Petersburg]]
*Member of academy in [[Moscow]]
*Member of academy in [[Göttingen]]
*Member of academy in [[Zagreb]]
*Member of academy in [[Belgrade]]
*Member of various societies in [[Kraków]]
*Member of various societies in [[Paris]]

He received several [[honorary doctorate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.riznicasrpska.net/vukijezik/index.php?topic=47.0 Riznica srpska — Vuk i jezik]&lt;/ref&gt; and was decorated by Russian and Austro-Hungarian monarchs, [[Prussian king]], [[Nicholas I of Montenegro]] and Russian academy of science.
[[UNESCO]] has proclaimed 1987 the year of Vuk Karadzić. Karadžić was also elected an honorary citizen of the city of [[Zagreb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Milutinović, Zoran |authorlink= |title=Review of the Book ''Jezik i nacionalizam'' |journal=[[The Slavonic and East European Review]] |volume=89 |issue=3 |pages=520–524 |year=2011 |url=http://www.snjezana-kordic.de/Rec_SEER.pdf |archivedate=7 July 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68yTd2jaR?url=http://www.snjezana-kordic.de/Rec_SEER.pdf |accessdate=2 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 100th anniversary of Karadžić's death (in 1964) student work brigades on youth action "Tršić 64" raised an amphitheater with a stage that was needed for organizing the "Vuk's Council", and "Vuk's Student Council". In 1987 Tršić received a comprehensive overhaul as a cultural-historical monument. Also, the road from Karadžić's home to Tronoša monastery was built.

Karadžić's birth house was declared Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance in 1979, and it is protected by [[Republic of Serbia]].
Recently, rural tourism has become popular in Tršić, with many families converting their houses into buildings designed to accommodate guests. TV series based on his life were broadcast on [[Radio Television of Serbia]]. His portrait is often seen in Serbian schools.

A student of primary (age six or seven to fourteen or fifteen) or secondary (age fourteen or fifteen to eighteen or nineteen) school in Serbia, that is awarded best grades for all subjects at the end of a school year, for each year in turn, is awarded at the end of his final year a "Vuk Karadžić diploma" and is known (in common speech) as "Vukovac" a synonyme for a member of an elite group of highest performing students.

==Quotes==
{{quote|Write as you speak and read as it is written.|The essence of modern [[Serbian language|Serbian]] spelling}}

Although the above quotation is often attributed to Vuk Stefanović Karadžić in Serbia, it is in fact an orthographic principle devised by the German grammarian and philologist [[Johann Christoph Adelung]]. Karadžić merely used that principle to push through his language reform.&lt;ref&gt;as stated in the book ''The Grammar of the Serbian Language'' by Ljubomir Popović&lt;/ref&gt; The attribution of the quote to Karadžić is a common misconception in Serbia, Montenegro and the rest of [[former Yugoslavia]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Due to that fact, the entrance exam to the [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Philology]] occasionally contains a question on the authorship of the quote (as a sort of [[trick question]]).{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}
