A [[political crisis]] in [[Montenegro]] ({{lang-cnr|kriza u Crnoj Gori}}) was initiated by the opposition parties which staged protests requesting fair elections and transitional government. Opposition coalition [[Democratic Front (Montenegro)|Democratic Front]] organised continuous protests in October 2015 which culminated in a large riot in [[Podgorica]] on 24 October. A split in the ruling coalition followed in January 2016, leaving the government functioning as a ''de facto'' minority government.

==Background==

===Milo Đukanović's leadership===
{{see also|Milo Đukanović}}
In 2015, the investigative journalists' network [[Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project|OCCRP]] named Montenegro's long-time President and Prime Minister [[Milo Đukanović]] "Person of the Year in Organized Crime".&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.occrp.org/personoftheyear/2015/ OCCRP announces 2015 Organized Crime and Corruption ‘Person of the Year’ Award]". [[Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project]].&lt;/ref&gt; The extent of Đukanović's [[corruption]] led to street demonstrations and calls for his removal.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.dw.com/en/montenegros-fractious-opposition-takes-to-the-streets/a-18854198 Montenegro's fractious opposition takes to the streets]". [[Deutsche Welle]]. 16 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2017/01/05/the-balkans-corrupt-leaders-are-playing-nato-for-a-fool/ The Balkans’ Corrupt Leaders are Playing NATO for a Fool]".

===Opposition===

On 27 September the Democratic Front set up tents by the building of the [[Parliament of Montenegro]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rts.rs/page/stories/ci/story/3/region/2051919/u-podgorici-protest-opozicije-demonstranti-u-satorima.html Протест опозиције у Подгорици]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-government protests==
'''Anti-government protests in Montenegro''' began in mid-October 2015 and culminated in riots on 24 October 2015 in the capital of [[Podgorica]]. The protests were organised by the opposition coalition [[Democratic Front (Montenegro)|Democratic Front]], which is requesting the formation of a transitional government which would organise next parliamentary elections.

After thousands of people rallied to protest government corruption and demand a transitional government and resignation of [[Prime Minister of Montenegro|Prime Minister]] [[Milo Đukanović]], who has held prime ministerial or presidential positions for most of the time since 1990, the police intervened tear-gassing the demonstrators on 24 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/tear-gas-thousands-demand-montenegro-pm-quits-213339710.html|title=Tear gas as thousands demand Montenegro PM quits|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Montenegrin police fired tear gas at opposition supporters, while chasing away the demonstrators with armored vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/10/24/world/europe/ap-eu-montenegro-clashes.html|title=Montenegro Police Throw Tear Gas on Protest|date=24 October 2015|work=AP|via=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A protest against joining NATO was held in Podgorica on 12 December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alo.rs/protest-protiv-nato-u-podgorici-video/23599 Protest protiv NATO u Podgorici]&lt;/ref&gt; A new protest against the government was held on 24 January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.srbijadanas.com/clanak/odrzan-jos-jedan-protest-u-podgorici-crvenim-kartonima-iskazali-nepoverenje-vladi-cg-24-01 Održan još jedan protest u Podgorici]&lt;/ref&gt;

==DPS–SDP split==
On January 27, 2016, a parliamentary vote saw the split of the ruling DPS and up until then [[Coalition for a European Montenegro|coalition partner]] SDP.&lt;ref name="BI-dismiss"&gt;[http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/montenegro-s-parliament-to-dismisses-speaker-02-23-2016 "Montenegro Parliament Set to Oust Speaker"], ''Balkan Insight''&lt;/ref&gt; This followed a failed crisis talk over the organization of the "first free and fair election".&lt;ref name="BI-dismiss"/&gt; The President of the National Assembly [[Ranko Krivokapić]] (SDP) strongly criticized Prime Minister Milo Djukanović and the ruling party (DPS). With the split of SDP, Djukanović lost the Assembly majority. Djukanović started an initiative to remove Krivokapić from the seat.

==Parliament interruption==
On 13 May 2016, Prime Minister Milo Đukanović's speech was interrupted by the Democratic Front MPs, who chanted "Milo, you thief" (''Milo, lopove''), which was followed by a verbal clash and an attempt at physical altercation, which was prevented by other MPs and parliamentary security service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2016&amp;mm=05&amp;dd=13&amp;nav_category=167&amp;nav_id=1131015 Atmosfera u Crnoj Gori podseća na kraj Miloševićeve vlasti]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 October 2016, on the day of the [[Montenegrin parliamentary election, 2016|parliamentary election]], a group of 20 Serbian and Montenegrin citizens, including the former head of [[Gendarmery (Serbia)|Serbian Gendarmery]] [[Bratislav Dikić]], were arrested;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/tema.php?yyyy=2016&amp;mm=10&amp;nav_id=1193328|title=Slučaj "državni udar" i Đukanovićev "stari recept"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/06/montenegro-prosecutor-milivoje-katnic-russian-nationalists-behind-alleged-coup-plot |title=Montenegrin prosecutor says Russian nationalists behind alleged coup plot}}&lt;/ref&gt; they, along with other persons, including Russian citizens, were later formally charged by the authorities of Montenegro with an attempted [[coup d'état]]. In February 2017, Montenegrin officials accused the Russian state structures of being behind the attempted coup, which envisaged an attack on the country's parliament and assassination of prime minister [[Milo Đukanović]]; those accusations were rejected by the Russian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Farmer|first1=Ben|title=Russia plotted to overthrow Montenegro's government by assassinating Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic last year, according to senior Whitehall sources|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/02/18/russias-deadly-plot-overthrow-montenegros-government-assassinating/|accessdate=21 February 2017 |work=The Telegraph|date=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kremlin rejects claims Russia had role in Montenegro coup plot|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/20/russian-state-bodies-attempted-a-coup-in-montenegro-says-prosecutor|accessdate=21 February 2017| work=The Guardian|date=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the prime minister [[Duško Marković]]′s statements made in February 2017, the government received definitive information about the coup being prepared on 12 October 2016, when a person involved in the plot gave away the fallback scenario of his Russian minders, who thus aimed to prevent the country from [[Accession of Montenegro to NATO|joining NATO]]; this information was also corroborated by the security services of NATO member countries, who helped the Montenegrin government to investigate the plot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://time.com/4673038/dusko-markovic-montenegro-russia-nato/ "Q&amp;A: Duško Marković, the Prime Minister Stuck Between Putin and Trump in the Balkans"], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', 16 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early June 2017, the High Court in Montenegro confirmed the indictment of 14 people, including two Russians and two pro-Russia Montenegrin opposition leaders, Andrija Mandic and Milan Knezevic, who had been charged with "preparing a conspiracy against the constitutional order and the security of Montenegro" and an "attempted terrorist act".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rferl.org/a/montenegro-coup-charges-confirmed/28535744.html "Montenegrin Court Confirms Charges Against Alleged Coup Plotters"],&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
===Parliament boycott===
Following the events which surrounded the latest [[Montenegrin parliamentary election, 2016|parliamentary election]], the major opposition parties made a decision to begin a collective boycott of all parliamentary sessions; the boycott continued into 2017, extending to local elections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/montenegro-opposition-to-boycott-polls-over-coup-plot-alligations-02-14-2017 "Montenegro Opposition to Boycott Poll Over ‘Coup’ Claims"] ''Balkan Insight''&lt;/ref&gt;

===NATO accession===
On 28 April 2017, Montenegro's parliament voted 46–0 to join NATO, while the opposition parties kept boycotting parliament sessions and protesters burned NATO flags outside.&lt;ref name="murkypolitico"&gt;[https://www.politico.eu/article/montenegro-nato-milo-dukanovicmurky-coup-plot/ Indictment tells murky Montenegrin coup tale: Trial will hear claims of Russian involvement in plans to assassinate prime minister and stop Balkan country’s NATO membership.] [[Politico]], 23 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Tensions between Montenegro and Russia continued to escalate thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Montenegro protests after senior politician held while changing planes at a Moscow airport|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/29/montenegro-protests-senior-politician-held-changing-planes-moscow/|accessdate=2 June 2017|work=AP|date=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Antonio Mattei Lluberas'''&lt;ref group=note&gt;{{Spanish name|'''Mattei'''|'''Lluberas'''|plain=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; (September 7, 1857 – January 15, 1908), was a businessman and politician who in 1897 planned and led the second and last major uprising against Spanish colonial rule in [[Puerto Rico]], known as the [[Intentona de Yauco]].

==Early years==
Mattei Lluberas was born in the town of [[Yauco, Puerto Rico]] to Antonio Mattei Casanova and Mercedes Lluberas Torres de Figueroa. Mattei Lluberas' father's parents, who were of [[Corsican people|Corsican]] descent, sent him to France where he received his primary and secondary education.&lt;ref name="GHA"&gt;[http://home.coqui.net/sarrasin/pers12.htm Protagonistas de la Guerra Hispano Americana en Puerto Rico Parte XII]&lt;/ref&gt;

He returned to Puerto Rico and became a wealthy businessman after he established a successful coffee plantation. He later married Ana María Rita Emmanuelli Negroni, the (daughter of Louis Henri Emanuelli Ciavaldini b 1824 [[Corsica]] and Ana Maria Negroni Rodriguez) and had three children: Rita María, Rita Monserrate and Luis Antonio.&lt;ref name="GHA"/&gt;

==Intentona de Yauco==
[[File:Intentona de Yauco.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Flag flown by Fidel Vélez and his men during the "Intentona de Yauco" revolt]]
{{Main article|Intentona de Yauco}}
Mattei Lluberas was among the many Puerto Ricans at the time who professed liberal ideals and believed that Puerto Rico should be an independent nation free from Spanish Colonial rule. As such, he became involved with the island's revolutionary movement and became one of their leaders.&lt;ref name="GHA"/&gt; In 1896, Mattei Lluberas met with Mateo Mercado and a group of "Yaucanos" (as the natives of Yauco are known) who believed in full independence of Puerto Rico in ''Barrio Barinas'' of Yauco and made plans to overthrow the government. On December of that year, the local Civil Guard discovered their plans and proceeded to arrest all those involved who, besides Mercado and Mattei Lluberas, included Dario and Carlos Franchesi and Emiliano Lavergue, however they were soon released and returned to their respective homes.&lt;ref name="HMPR"&gt;''Historia militar de Puerto Rico'', by [[Hector Andres Negroni]] (Author); Pages: 305–06; Publisher: Sociedad Estatal Quinto Centenario (1992); Spanish; {{ISBN|84-7844-138-7}}; {{ISBN|978-84-7844-138-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1897, Mattei Lluberas visited the Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee in New York City. There he met with Ramon Emeterio Betances, Juan de Mata Terreforte and Aurelio Méndez Martinez and together they proceeded to plan a major coup. The uprising was to be directed by Betances, organized by Mendez Mercado and the armed forces were to be commanded by General Rius Rivera. At the time Rius Rivera, who joined [[José Martí]]'s struggle for Cuban independence as a member of the Cuban Liberation Army, was the Commander-in-Chief of the Cuban Liberation Army of the West.&lt;ref&gt;[http://solidaridad_cuba.tripod.com/id50.html ''Noticias de la XVII Brigada Juan Rius Rivera en Cuba'']{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In accordance to the plan, Mattei Lluberas purchased 30,000 machetes which were to be distributed amongst the rebels. Mattei Lluberas returned to Puerto Rico with a [[Flag of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican flag]] and began to proceed with the plans of the revolt with his group. The Budet Rivera brothers established an insurgent training camp in the farm of Gullermo Velazco. Fellow rebels, Gerardo Forest Velez and Agustin F. Morales (himself a general in the Army of the [[Dominican Republic]]), were in charge of propaganda and traveled throughout the island seeking public support for their cause. Cuban revolutionist Tomas Estrada Palma, offered a contribution of 500 rifles with half a million rounds of ammunition and his comrade offered a steamship with an invading force of 200 men under the command of General Agustin F. Morales. The revolution was set for the beginning of the month of December 1897.&lt;ref name="MHPR"&gt;''Historia militar de Puerto Rico'', by [[Hector Andres Negroni]] (Author); Pages: 307; Publisher: Sociedad Estatal Quinto Centenario (1992); Spanish; {{ISBN|84-7844-138-7}}; {{ISBN|978-84-7844-138-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mayor of Yauco Francisco Lluch Barreras heard the rumors of the planned uprising, he immediately notified General Sabas Marín González the governor of the island.

Fidel Velez, a native of [[Sabana Grande, Puerto Rico|Sabana Grande]] and one of the separatist leaders, found out that the Spanish authorities knew about their plans and immediately held a meeting with Mattei Lluberas and the other leaders. Fearing that they all would soon be arrested, he demanded that the insurrection start immediately and not in December. In the discussion that followed, the other leaders did not agree with him, fearing that such a haste action would lead to the same disastrous results of ''[[El Grito de Lares]]''.&lt;ref name="MHPR"/&gt;

On March 24, 1897, Fidel Velez and his men met at Susua Arriba, just outside Yauco. They unfurled the Puerto Rican flag for the first time in Puerto Rican soil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://joseosvaldo.freeyellow.com/Sabiausted.htm Sabia Usted?] {{es icon}}, Sabana Grande, Retrieved Feb. 25, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://flagspot.net/flags/pr.html#f The Flag], Flags of the World, Retrieved Feb. 25, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and marched towards the town. They planned to attack the barracks of the Spanish Civil Guard with the aim of gaining control of the arms and ammunition which were stored there. The plan did not succeed because when they arrived they were ambushed by the Spanish forces who had set up positions and were waiting for them. A firefight ensued upon the arrival of the group and the rebels quickly retreated. On March 26, another group headed by Jose Nicolas Quiñones Torres and Ramon Torres attempted to fight the Spaniards in a barrio called "Quebradas" of Yauco, however said revolt also failed.&lt;ref name="MHPR"/&gt; Over 150 rebels were arrested, accused of various crimes against the state and sent to prison in the City of [[Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponce]]. Velez fled to [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]] where he lived in exile, while Mattei Lluberas went into exile in New York City and joined a group known as the "Puerto Rican Commission".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.proyectosalonhogar.com/Enciclopedia_Ilustrada/Documentos_historicos/Protagonistas/P12.htm Projecto Salon Hogar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304092737/http://www.proyectosalonhogar.com/Enciclopedia_Ilustrada/Documentos_historicos/Protagonistas/P12.htm |date=2016-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mattei Lluberas and the [[Puerto Rican Commission]] in New York had been trying to convince President [[William McKinley]] to invade Puerto Rico for sometime. After Cuba was taken during the [[Spanish–American War]], President McKinley approved the land invasion of Puerto Rico. A convoy of ships left [[Tampa, Florida]] and on July 21 another convoy departed from [[Guantánamo]] for a 4-day journey to Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name="AAMPR"&gt;

Under the terms of the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris of 1898]], ratified on December 10, 1898, Puerto Rico was annexed by the United States.

==Later years==
In 1904, Mattei Lluberas was elected Mayor of Yauco as a candidate of the pro-statehood Republican Party of Puerto Rico. Mattei Lluberas died on January 15, 1908.&lt;ref name="SH"/&gt; The town of Yauco honored his memory by naming an avenue after him.

Mitchem''' was the president and founder of the [[non-profit organization]] the Council for Opportunity in Education in [[Washington, DC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coenet.us|title=Council for Opportunity in Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; He currently serves as President Emeritus for the organization.
 
Dr. Mitchem has spent his entire career advocating for equal access to post-secondary education and success of students in the United States—which he views as an extension of the [[Civil Rights Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;An Advocate for Access Reflects on Decades of Political Battles(http://chronicle.com/article/An-Advocate-for-Access/141957/)[http://chronicle.com/article/An-Advocate-for-Access/141957/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitchem|url=http://www.sitemason.com/files/cv70l2/Arnold%20L.%20Mitchem_Bio.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This better described the students he sought to assist and moved access issues beyond racial boundaries to show that access was a more widespread problem.
 
This concept was adopted in the re-authorization of the Higher Education Act of 1980.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/96/hr5680) H.R. 5680 (96th): Higher Education Amendments of 1980]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ban Ki-moon''' ({{IPAc-en|b|æ|n}}; {{Korean |hangul = 반기문 |hanja = 潘基文}}; {{IPA-ko|pan.ɡi.mun}}; born 13 June 1944) is a [[South Korea|South Korean]] diplomat who was the eighth [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]] of the [[United Nations]] from January 2007 to December 2016. Before becoming Secretary-General, Ban was a career diplomat in South Korea's [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (South Korea)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] and in the United Nations. He entered [[diplomatic service]] the year he graduated from university, accepting his first post in [[New Delhi, India]].

Ban was the [[foreign minister]] of [[South Korea]] from January 2004 to November 2006. In February 2006 he began to campaign for the office of Secretary-General. Ban was initially considered to be a long shot for the office. As foreign minister of South Korea, however, he was able to travel to all the countries on the [[United Nations Security Council]], a maneuver that turned him into the campaign's front runner.

On 13 October 2006, he was elected to be the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations#List of Secretaries-General|eighth Secretary-General]] by the [[United Nations General Assembly]]. On 1 January 2007, he succeeded [[Kofi Annan]]. As Secretary-General, he was responsible for several major reforms on peacekeeping and UN employment practices. Diplomatically, Ban has taken particularly strong views on [[global warming]], pressing the issue repeatedly with U.S. President [[George W. Bush]], and on the [[Darfur conflict]], where he helped persuade Sudanese president [[Omar al-Bashir]] to allow peacekeeping troops to enter [[Sudan]].&lt;ref name="Guardian1-27"&gt;{{Cite news|date = 27 January 2011|url =https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jan/27/ban-ki-moon-un-climate-change-talks|title = Ban Ki-moon ends hands-on involvement in climate change talks|work = [[The Guardian]]|author = [[Suzanne Goldenberg]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WPost4-17"&gt;{{Cite news|date = 17 April 2007|url =https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/16/AR2007041601508.html|title = Sudan To Allow U.N.

Ban was named the world's 32nd most powerful person by the [[Forbes list of The World's Most Powerful People|''Forbes'' list of The World's Most Powerful People]] in 2013, the highest among South Koreans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Forbes]]|title=Ban Ki-moon|url=https://www.forbes.com/pictures/lmh45kjle/no-32-ban-ki-moon/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, he was named the third most powerful South Korean after [[Lee Kun-hee]] and [[Lee Jae-yong (businessman)|Lee Jae-yong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/powerful-people/list/#tab:overall|title=The World's Most Powerful People|work=Forbes|accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' named Ban one of the [[FP Top 100 Global Thinkers|Top 100 Global Thinkers]] for his achievement of making the [[Paris Agreement]] a legally binding treaty less than a year after it was adopted.&lt;ref name="fpgt2016"&gt;{{cite web |title=FP Global Thinkers 2016 |url=https://gt.foreignpolicy.com/2016/profile/ban-ki-moon |work=Foreign Policy |date=12 December 2016 |accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 September 2017, Ban was elected chair of the [[International Olympic Committee|International Olympic Committee's]] Ethics Commission.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.olympic.org/news/ioc-elects-former-united-nations-secretary-general-ban-ki-moon-to-head-its-ethics-commission&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2017, Ban co-founded the nonprofit Ban Ki-moon Centre for Global Citizens. He also currently serves as Distinguished Chair Professor at [[Yonsei University|Yonsei University's]] Institute for Global Engagement and Empowerment.&lt;ref name="BKM Yonsei"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=3034398|title=Ban Ki-Moon to begin his tenure at Yonsei|website=[[Korea JoongAng Daily]]|access-date=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Ban was born on 13 June 1944 in the small farming village of Haengchi, Wonnam Township (''-myeon''), in [[Eumseong County]], [[North Chungcheong Province]] in [[Korea]].&lt;ref name="eumseong.go.kr"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.eumseong.go.kr/english/contents.do?key=933 |title = Welcomto Eumseong |accessdate = 14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Times12-09"&gt;{{Cite news|date = 9 December 2006|url =https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/09/world/asia/09ban.html?_r=3&amp;ref=world&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin|title = For New U.N. Chief, a Past Misstep Leads to Opportunity|work = [[The New York Times]]|author = [[Warren Hoge]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family then moved to the nearby town of [[Chungju]], where he grew up.&lt;ref name="NYT 12-22"/&gt; During Ban's childhood, his father had a warehouse business, but the warehouse went bankrupt and the family lost its middle-class standard of living. When Ban was six, his family fled to a remote mountainside for much of the [[Korean War]].&lt;ref name="Times12-09"/&gt; After the war ended, his family returned to [[Chungju]]. Ban has said that, during this time, he met [[United States Armed Forces|American soldiers]].&lt;ref name="LAT10-09"/&gt;

In secondary school ([[Chungju High School]]), Ban became a star student, particularly in his studies of the [[English language]]. In 1962, Ban won an essay contest sponsored by the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] and earned a trip to the [[United States]] where he lived in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] with a host family for several months.&lt;ref name="FT10-10"/&gt; As part of the trip, Ban met U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]].&lt;ref name="Times12-09"/&gt; When a journalist at the meeting asked Ban what he wanted to be when he grew up, he said, "I want to become a diplomat."&lt;ref name="LAT10-09"/&gt;

He received a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[international relations]] from [[Seoul National University]] in 1970, and earned a [[Master of Public Administration]] from the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]] in 1985.&lt;ref name="LAT10-09"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Aspiring U.N.

In addition to his native [[Korean language|Korean]], Ban speaks [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]]. According to a retired UN official, "one of Ban's biggest handicaps was his lack of fluency in English, which made it difficult for him to win over audiences in the US and elsewhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Disquiet grows over performance of Ban Ki-moon, UN's 'invisible man' |date=22 July 2010 |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/22/ban-ki-moon-secretary-general-un}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been questions, however, regarding the extent of his knowledge of French, one of the two [[working language]]s of the [[United Nations Secretariat]].&lt;ref name=Phoney/&gt;

==Career==

===Diplomatic career===
{{multiple image| direction = vertical| width = 250| align = right| image1 = Ban Ki-moon and Condoleezza Rice.jpg| caption1 = Ban, left, with [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Condoleezza Rice]] in January 2006| image2 = Ban Ki-moon, Mrs Ban, Peter Krämer and Jaka Bizilj.jpg| caption2 = Left to right: Peter Krämer, Yoo Soon-taek, [[Jaka Bizilj]], and Ban at [[Sports for Peace]] in 2010}}
After graduating from university, Ban received the top score on Korea's foreign service exam. He joined the [[Foreign relations of South Korea|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] in May 1970 and worked his way up the career ladder during the years of the [[Yusin Constitution]].&lt;ref name="FT10-10"/&gt;

Ban's first overseas posting was to [[New Delhi]], [[India]], where he served as vice consul and impressed many of his superiors in the foreign ministry with his competence. Ban reportedly accepted a posting to India rather than the United States, because in India he would be able to save more money to send to his family.&lt;ref name=BBCprofile/&gt;&lt;ref name=KH/&gt; In 1974 he received his first posting to the United Nations, as First Secretary of the South Permanent Observer Mission (South Korea became a full UN member-state on 17 September 1991).&lt;ref name="NYT10-03"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Council Backs South Korean for U.N. Secretary General|work = [[The New York Times]]|author = [[Warren Hoge]]|date = 3 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Park Chung-hee]]'s 1979 assassination, Ban assumed the post of Director of the United Nations Division.

In 1980 Ban became director of the United Nations' International Organizations and Treaties Bureau, headquartered in [[Seoul]].&lt;ref name=KH/&gt; He has been posted twice to the South Korean embassy in [[Washington, D.C.]] Between these two assignments he served as Director-General for American Affairs in 1990–92. In 1992, he became Vice Chairman of the South-North Joint Nuclear Control Commission, following the adoption by South and [[North Korea]] of the Joint Declaration of the Denuclearization of the [[Korean Peninsula]].&lt;ref name=BBCprofile/&gt; From 1993 to 1994 Ban was Korea's deputy ambassador to the United States. He was promoted to the position of Deputy Minister for Policy Planning and International Organizations in 1995 and then appointed National Security Advisor to the President in 1996.&lt;ref name=KH/&gt; Ban's lengthy career overseas has been credited with helping him avoid South Korea's unforgiving political environment.&lt;ref name=Time&gt;{{Cite news|url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1543932,00.html|title = Can This Guy Run the U.N.?|date = 16 October 2006|work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ban was appointed [[Ambassador]] to [[Austria]] and [[Slovenia]] in 1998, and a year later he was also elected as Chairman of the Preparatory Commission for the [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization]] (CTBTO PrepCom). During the negotiations, in what Ban considers the biggest blunder of his career, he included in a public letter a positive statement about the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]] in 2001, not long after the United States had decided to abandon the treaty. To avoid anger from the United States, Ban was fired by President [[Kim Dae-jung]], who also issued a public apology for Ban's statement.&lt;ref name="Times12-09"/&gt;

Ban was unemployed for the only time in his career and was expecting to receive an assignment to work in a remote and unimportant embassy.&lt;ref name="Times12-09"/&gt; In 2001, during the 56th Session of the [[United Nations General Assembly]], South Korea held the rotating presidency, and to Ban's surprise, he was selected to be the chief of staff to general assembly president [[Han Seung-soo]].&lt;ref name="Times10-14"&gt;{{Cite news|work = The New York Times|date = 14 October 2006|title = South Korean Is Appointed Secretary General of the U.N.|author = Warren Hoge}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, incoming president [[Roh Moo-hyun]] selected Ban as one of his foreign policy advisors.&lt;ref name=KH/&gt;

====Foreign minister of South Korea====
In 2004, Ban replaced [[Yoon Young-kwan]] as foreign minister of South Korea under president [[Roh Moo-hyun]].&lt;ref name="LAT10-09"/&gt; At the beginning of his term, Ban was faced with two major crises: in June 2004 [[Kim Sun-il]], a South Korean working as an Arabic translator, was kidnapped and killed in Iraq by [[Islamism|Islamic extremists]]; and in December 2004 dozens of Koreans died in the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|2004 Indian Ocean tsunami]]. Ban survived scrutiny from lawmakers and saw an upturn in his popularity when talks began with North Korea.&lt;ref name=KH&gt;{{Cite news|title = Ban surges toward next career step|author = Lee Joo-hee|work = [[The Korea Herald]]|date = 15 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ban became actively involved in issues relating to North-South Korean relationships.&lt;ref name=BBCprofile&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/5401856.stm|title = Profile: Ban Ki-moon|publisher = [[BBC News]]|date = 13 October 2006|accessdate =4 August 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070911051025/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/5401856.stm| archivedate= 11 September 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2005, as [[foreign minister]], he played a leading role in the diplomatic efforts to adopt the Joint Statement on resolving the North Korean nuclear issue at the Fourth Round of the [[Six-party talks]] held in [[Beijing]].&lt;ref name="Official Bio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Newsweek"&gt;{{Cite news|url =http://www.newsweek.com/id/45039|title = A Baptism by Fire; Even before taking office, the newly elected secretary-general of the United Nations is confronted with a global crisis|date = 23 October 2006|author = [[Lally Weymouth]]|work = [[Newsweek]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As foreign minister, Ban oversaw the trade and aid policies of South Korea. This work put Ban in the position of signing trade deals and delivering foreign assistance to diplomats who would later be influential in his candidacy for Secretary-General. For example, Ban became the first senior South Korean minister to travel to the [[Republic of the Congo]] since its independence in 1960.&lt;ref name=WashPost0929&gt;{{Cite news|title = S.

In February 2006, Ban declared his candidacy to replace [[Kofi Annan]] as UN Secretary-General at the end of 2006, becoming the first South Korean to run for the office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://times.hankooki.com/lpage/nation/200602/kt2006021416334111990.htm|title=Minister Ban to Run for Top UN Job|author=Park Song-wu|work=[[The Korea Times]]|accessdate=28 September 2006|date=14 February 2006}}{{dead link|date=February 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Ban was the first to announce a candidacy, he was not originally considered a serious contender.&lt;ref name="FT10-10"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Relentless pursuit brings a challenge close to home; Profile Ban Ki-moon|work = [[Financial Times]]|author = Anna Fifield|date = 10 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next eight months, Ban made ministerial visits to each of the 15 countries with a seat on the Security Council.&lt;ref name="LAT10-09"/&gt; Of the seven candidates, he topped each of the four [[straw poll]]s conducted by the [[United Nations Security Council]]: on 24 July,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unsg.org/wordpress/archives/115|title=Ban takes 1st Straw Poll|work=UNSG.org]|date=24 July 2006|accessdate=28 September 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808050637/http://unsg.org/wordpress/archives/115 |archivedate=8 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; 14 September,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unsg.org/wordpress/archives/138|title=Ban firms up lead in second Straw Poll|work=UNSG.org]|date=14 September 2006|accessdate=28 September 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612093608/http://www.unsg.org/wordpress/archives/138 |archivedate=12 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 28 September,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unsg.org/wordpress/archives/164|title=Ban slips but holds, Vīķe-Freiberga pushes into third|work=UNSG.org]|date=28 September 2006|accessdate=28 September 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612093630/http://www.unsg.org/wordpress/archives/164 |archivedate=12 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unsg.org/wordpress/archives/170|title=Ban Ki-moon wins|work=UNSG.org]|date=2 October 2006|accessdate=2 October 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061104211923/http://www.unsg.org/wordpress/archives/170|archivedate=4 November 2006|deadurl= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period in which these polls took place, Ban made major speeches to the [[Asia Society]] and the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.asiasource.org/news/special_reports/kimoon.cfm|publisher = Asiasource.org|title = Foreign Minister Ban Ki-moon interview|date = 26 September 2006|accessdate = 2 August 2007|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070804044245/http://www.asiasource.org/news/special_reports/kimoon.cfm|archivedate = 4 August 2007|deadurl = yes|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.asiasociety.org/speeches/06ny_ban.html|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061001150102/http://www.asiasociety.org/speeches/06ny_ban.html|dead-url = yes|archive-date = 1 October 2006|date = 25 September 2006|accessdate = 2 August 2007|work = Ban Ki-moon address to Asia Society (transcript)|title = The Quest for Peace and Prosperity in the Asia-Pacific and Beyond}}&lt;/ref&gt; To be confirmed, Ban needed not only to win the support of the diplomatic community, but also to be able to avoid a veto from any of the five permanent members of the council: [[People's Republic of China]], [[France]], [[Russia]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]]. Ban was popular in Washington for having pushed to send South Korean troops to Iraq, and had the support of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] as he pursued the position.&lt;ref&gt;Gamage, Daya (30 April 2010), [http://www.asiantribune.com/news/2010/04/30/un%E2%80%99s-lynn-pascoe-cannot-avoid-being-influenced-us-state-department-agenda-sri-lanka "UN's Lynn Pascoe cannot avoid being influenced by US State Department agenda on Sri Lanka"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523212922/http://www.asiantribune.com/news/2010/04/30/un%E2%80%99s-lynn-pascoe-cannot-avoid-being-influenced-us-state-department-agenda-sri-lanka |date=23 May 2012 }}, ''Asian Tribune''. Retrieved 7 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; But Ban also opposed several U.S. positions: he expressed his support for the [[International Criminal Court]] and favoured an entirely non-confrontational approach to dealing with North Korea.&lt;ref name="LAT10-09"/&gt; Ban said during his campaign that he would like to visit North Korea in person to meet with [[Kim Jong-il]] directly.&lt;ref name="Newsweek"/&gt; Ban was viewed as a stark contrast from Kofi Annan, who was considered charismatic, but perceived as a weak manager because of problems surrounding the UN's oil-for-food program in [[Iraq]].&lt;ref name="Economist10-07"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.unsgselection.org/files/Economist_EnterMrBan_7Oct06.pdf|format = PDF|title = Enter Mr Ban; The UN's new secretary-general|work = [[The Economist]]|date = 7 October 2006|access-date = 24 February 2008|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080226215119/http://www.unsgselection.org/files/Economist_EnterMrBan_7Oct06.pdf|archive-date = 26 February 2008|dead-url = yes|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ban struggled to win the approval of France. His official biography states that he speaks both [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]], the two working languages of the UN Secretariat. However, he has repeatedly struggled to answer questions in French from journalists.&lt;ref name=Phoney&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/reportsfromabroad/herland/20061214.html|title=Is Ban Ki-moon a franco-phoney?|work = [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC News]]|date = 14 December 2006|accessdate =2 August 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070711132843/http://www.cbc.ca/news/reportsfromabroad/herland/20061214.html| archivedate= 11 July 2007 | deadurl= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ban has repeatedly acknowledged his limitations at French, but assured French diplomats that he was devoted to continuing his study. At a press conference on 11 January 2007, Ban remarked, "My French perhaps could be improved, and I am continuing to work. I have taken French lessons over the last few months.

As the Secretary-General election drew closer, there was rising criticism of the South Korean campaign on Ban's behalf. Specifically, his alleged practice of systematically visiting all member states of the Security Council in his role as the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade to secure votes in his support by signing trade deals with European countries and pledging [[aid]] to [[developing country|developing countries]] were the focus of many news articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,25689-2380336,00.html|title = Millions of dollars and a piano may put Korean in UN's top job|work = [[The Times]]|date = 26 September 2006|accessdate =2 August 2007 |location=London|first1=Richard|last1=Beeston|first2=James|last2=Bone}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', "rivals have privately grumbled that Republic of Korea, which has the world's 11th-largest economy, has wielded its economic might to generate support for his candidacy". Ban reportedly said that these insinuations were "groundless". In an interview on 17 September 2006 he stated: "As front-runner, I know that I can become a target of this very scrutinizing process", and that he was "a man of integrity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/28/AR2006092801765.html|work = The Washington Post|date = 28 September 2006|accessdate = 2 August 2007|title = S. Korean Contender for U.N. Post Has an Edge|first=Colum|last=Lynch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the final informal poll on 2 October, Ban received fourteen favorable votes and one abstention ("no opinion") from the fifteen members of the Security Council. The one abstention came from the Japanese delegation, who [[Japan–Korea disputes|vehemently opposed]] the idea of a Korean taking the role of Secretary-General. Due to the overwhelming support of Ban by the rest of the Security Council, Japan later voted in favor of Ban to avoid controversy. More importantly, Ban was the only one to escape a veto; each of the other candidates received at least one "no" vote from among the five permanent members. After the vote, Shashi Tharoor, who finished second, withdrew his candidacy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/video/player/news/shashi-tharoor-pulls-out-of-un-race/7904|title=Shashi Tharoor pulls out of UN race|work=NDTV.com|date=3 October 2006|accessdate=2 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and China's [[Permanent Representative]] to the UN told reporters that "it is quite clear from today's straw poll that Minister Ban Ki-moon is the candidate that the Security Council will recommend to the General Assembly".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webcast.un.org/ramgen/sc/so061002pm3.rm |title=United Nations Webcast of announcement |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=2 August 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807235855/http://webcast.un.org/ramgen/sc/so061002pm3.rm |archivedate= 7 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 October, the Security Council formally chose Ban as its nominee. In the public vote, he was supported by all 15 members of the council.&lt;ref name="NYT10-10"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Security Council Approves South Korean as U.N. Chief|author = Warren Hoge and Choe Sang-Hun|work = The New York Times|date = 10 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 October, the 192-member [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] [[acclamation|acclaimed]] Ban as Secretary-General.&lt;ref name="Times10-14"/&gt;

====First term as Secretary-General====
[[File:Vladimir Putin 9 April 2008-1.jpg|thumb|Ban Ki-moon with the [[President of Russia]] [[Vladimir Putin]] in [[Moscow]] on 9 April 2008]][[File:Ban Ki-moon - World Economic Forum Annual Meeting Davos 2008 numb2.jpg|thumb|Ban Ki-moon at Davos, Switzerland in the World Economic Forum.|223x223px]]
When Ban became Secretary-General, ''[[The Economist]]'' listed the major challenges facing him in 2007: "rising nuclear demons in [[Iran]] and North Korea, a haemorrhaging wound in [[Darfur]], unending violence in the Middle East, looming environmental disaster, escalating international terrorism, the proliferation of [[weapons of mass destruction]], the spread of [[HIV/AIDS]]. And then the more parochial concerns, such as the largely unfinished business of the most sweeping attempt at reform in the UN's history".&lt;ref name="Econ01-06"/&gt; Before starting, Kofi Annan shared the story that when the first Secretary-General [[Trygve Lie]] left office, he told his successor, [[Dag Hammarskjöld]], "You are about to take over the most impossible job on earth".&lt;ref name="Times10-14"/&gt;

On 23 January 2007 Ban took office as the eighth Secretary-General of the United Nations. Ban's term as Secretary-General opened with a flap. At his first encounter with the press as Secretary-General on 2 January 2007, he refused to condemn the [[death penalty]] imposed on [[Saddam Hussein]] by the Iraqi High Tribunal, remarking, "The issue of capital punishment is for each and every member State to decide".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/apps/sg/offthecuff.asp?nid=964 |publisher=[[United Nations]] |title=Secretary-General's encounter with the UN press corps (transcript) |date=2 January 2007 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=29 January 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929072706/http://www.un.org/apps/sg/offthecuff.asp?nid=964 |archivedate=29 September 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ban's statements contradicted long-standing United Nations opposition to the death penalty as a human-rights concern.&lt;ref name="NYT01-03"&gt;{{Cite news| url =https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/03/world/middleeast/03nations.html|title = New U.N.

In a statement through his spokesperson on 6 January, he "strongly urged the Government of Iraq to grant a stay of execution to those whose death sentences may be carried out in the near future".&lt;ref name="FT02-01"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/apps/sg/sgstats.asp?nid=2395 |title=Statement attributable to the Spokesperson for the Secretary-General on the death sentences in Iraq |publisher=United Nations |date=6 January 2007 |accessdate=2 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613201152/http://www.un.org/apps/sg/sgstats.asp?nid=2395 |archivedate=13 June 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the broader issue, he told a Washington, D.C. audience on 16 January 2007 that he recognized and encouraged the "growing trend in international society, international law and domestic policies and practices to phase out eventually the death penalty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/apps/sg/sgstats.asp?nid=2410 |title=Address at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and Q&amp;A (transcript) |publisher=United Nations |date=16 January 2007 |accessdate=2 August 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711105522/http://www.un.org/apps/sg/sgstats.asp?nid=2410 |archivedate=11 July 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{update|date=October 2013}}

On the tenth anniversary of [[Khmer Rouge]] leader [[Pol Pot]]'s death, 15 April 2008, Ban Ki-moon appealed for the senior leaders of the regime to be brought to justice. The [[Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia]]-tribunal, which was established by both the United Nations and [[Cambodia]] and which became operational in 2006, is expected to continue until at least 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/04/15/un.pol.pot/index.html|title = U.N. chief calls for justice in Cambodia|publisher = [[CNN]]|date = 15 April 2008|accessdate =15 April 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080420092415/http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/04/15/un.pol.pot/index.html| archivedate= 20 April 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ban has received strong criticism from the [[United Nations Office of Internal Oversight Services|UN Office of Internal Oversight Services]] (OIOS), which stated that the secretariat under Ban's leadership was "drifting into irrelevance".&lt;ref name=OIOS&gt;{{Cite news|url =https://foreignpolicy.com/files/fp_uploaded_documents/100719_0_ahleniussummary.pdf|title = Arrhenius End of Assignment Report|date = 14 June 2010|accessdate =16 January 2012|work = [[Foreign Policy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Cabinet=====
In early January, Ban appointed the key members of his cabinet. As his [[United Nations Deputy Secretary-General|Deputy Secretary-General]], he selected [[Tanzania]]n foreign minister and professor [[Asha-Rose Migiro]], a move that pleased African diplomats who had concerns of losing power without Annan in office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url =https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/06/world/06nations.html|title = Tanzanian Woman Is Chosen for U.N.'s 2nd Highest Post|work = [[The New York Times]]|date = 6 January 2007|author = Julia Preston }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The top position devoted exclusively to management, Under-Secretary-General for Management, was filled by [[Alicia Bárcena Ibarra]] of Mexico. Bárcena was considered a UN insider, having previously served as Annan's chief of staff. Her appointment was seen by critics as an indication that Ban would not make dramatic changes to UN bureaucracy.&lt;ref name="NYT01-04"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Mexican U.N. Insider Gets Manager's Post|date = 4 January 2007|author = Julia Preston}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ban appointed [[John Holmes (British diplomat)|Sir John Holmes]], the British Ambassador to France, as [[Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator|Under-Secretary-General for humanitarian affairs and coordinator of emergency relief]].&lt;ref name="NYT01-04"/&gt;

Ban initially said that he would delay making other appointments until his first round of reforms were approved, yet later abandoned this idea after receiving criticism.&lt;ref name="FT02-01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT02-06"/&gt; In February he continued with appointments, selecting [[B. Lynn Pascoe]], the U.S. ambassador to Indonesia, to become Under-Secretary-General for political affairs. [[Jean-Marie Guéhenno]], a French diplomat, who had served as Under-Secretary-General for peacekeeping operations under Annan, remained in office. Ban selected [[Vijay K. Nambiar]] as his chief of staff.&lt;ref name="NYT02-10"&gt;{{Cite news|title = U.N. Chief Gives Key Post to American|author = [[Warren Hoge]]|date = 10 February 2007|work = The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The appointment of many women to top jobs was seen as fulfilling a campaign promise Ban had made to increase the role of women in the United Nations. During Ban's first year as Secretary-General, more top jobs were being handled by women than ever before. Though not appointed by Ban, the president of the General Assembly, [[Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa]], is only the third woman to hold this position in United Nations history.&lt;ref name="CT04-11"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Leaders making world of difference\ Higher profile at UN brings new emphasis on issues affecting women|author = Stevenson Swanson|work = [[Chicago Tribune]]|date = 11 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Reform agenda=====
During his first month in office, Ban proposed two major reforms: to split the UN peacekeeping operation into two departments and to combine the political affairs and disarmament department. His proposals were met with stiff resistance from members of the UN General Assembly who bristled under Ban's request for rapid approval. The proposed merger of the disarmament and political affairs offices was criticized by many in the developing world, partially because of rumours that Ban hoped to place American B. Lynn Pascoe in charge of the new office. [[Alejandro D. Wolff]], then acting American ambassador, said the United States backed his proposals.&lt;ref name="FT02-01"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Ban's month of muddle: how the new UN chief is struggling to win over the doubters|author = Mark Turner|date = 1 February 2007|work = [[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT02-06"&gt;{{Cite news|title = U.N.

[[File:Ban Ki-moon and Bill Gates World Economic Forum 2013.jpg|thumb|Ban Ki-moon with [[Bill Gates]], World Economic Forum, 24 January 2013]]
After the early bout of reproach, Ban began extensive consultation with UN ambassadors, agreeing to have his peacekeeping proposal extensively vetted. After the consultations, Ban dropped his proposal to combine political affairs and disarmament.&lt;ref name="NYT02-19"&gt;{{Cite news|title = U.N. Chief Is Assuaging Doubts About Leadership|author = Warren Hoge|date = 19 February 2007|work = The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ban nevertheless pressed ahead with reforms on job requirements at the UN requiring that all positions be considered five-year appointments, all receive strict annual performance reviews, and all financial disclosures be made public. Though unpopular in the New York office, the move was popular in other UN offices around the world and lauded by UN observers.&lt;ref name="NYT02-28"&gt;{{Cite news|title = New United Nations Chief Tackles the Agency's Tradition of Patronage Jobs|work = The New York Times|date = 28 February 2007|author = Warren Hoge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ban's proposal to split the peacekeeping operation into one group handling operations and another handling arms was finally adopted in mid-March 2007.&lt;ref name=IrishTimes&gt;{{Cite news|title = Ban Ki-moon learns the hard way|work = [[The Irish Times]]|author = Maggie Farley|date = 11 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Key issues=====
The Secretary-General of the United Nations has the ability to influence debate on nearly any global issue. Although unsuccessful in some areas, Ban's predecessor Annan had been successful in increasing the UN peacekeeping presence and in popularizing the [[Millennium Development Goals]]. UN observers were eager to see on which issues Ban intended to focus, in addition to his declared interest in reforming the United Nations bureaucracy.&lt;ref name="Econ01-06"/&gt;

On several prominent issues, such as proliferation in Iran and North Korea, Ban has deferred to the Security Council.&lt;ref name=IrishTimes/&gt; In 2007, the [[Republic of Nauru]] raised the issue of allowing the Republic of China (Taiwan) to sign the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]]. Ban referenced the [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758]], and refused the motion. On 19 July 2007, Taiwanese President [[Chen Shui-bian]] wrote to request admission into the UN by the name Taiwan. Ban rejected the request, stating that Resolution 2758 defined Taiwan as part of China.&lt;ref name=Taipei&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2007/07/30/2003371907|title = MOFA spokesman slams Ban Ki-moon for rejecting UN bid|date = 30 July 2007|accessdate =30 August 2007|work = [[Taipei Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

======Global warming======

Ban early on identified [[global warming]] as one of the key issues of his administration. In a [[White House]] meeting with U.S. President George W. Bush in January, Ban urged Bush to take steps to curb [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. On 1 March 2007 in a speech before the UN General Assembly, Ban emphasized his concerns about global warming. Ban stated, "For my generation, coming of age at the height of the Cold War, fear of [[nuclear winter]] seemed the leading [[existential threat]] on the horizon. But the danger posed by war to all humanity—and to our planet—is at least matched by [[climate change]]"&lt;ref name="Wash03-02"&gt;{{Cite news|url =https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/01/AR2007030101484.html|title = U.N.

On 3 September 2009 he further emphasized his concerns at the World Climate Conference in Geneva, when he stated, "Our foot is stuck on the accelerator and we are heading towards an abyss".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=31926&amp;Cr=climate+change&amp;Cr1= Ban urges rapid progress in negotiations on new climate change pact].

======Middle East======
On Thursday, 22 March 2007, while Ban was taking part in the first stop of a tour of the Middle East, a mortar attack hit just {{convert|80|m|sp=us}} from where the Secretary-General was standing, interrupting a press conference in [[Baghdad]]'s [[Green Zone]], and visibly shaking Ban and others. No one was hurt in the incident.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-03/23/content_5884102.htm Rocket blast shakes UN chief in Baghdad]. Xinhua, 23 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations had already limited its role in Iraq after its Baghdad headquarters was bombed in August 2003, killing 22 people. Ban said, however, that he still hoped to find a way for the United Nations to "do more for Iraqi social and political development".&lt;ref name="NYT03-24"&gt;{{Cite news|title = U.N.

On his trip, Ban visited [[Egypt]], [[Israel]], the [[West Bank]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]] and [[Saudi Arabia]], where Ban attended a conference with leaders of the [[Arab League]] and met for several hours with [[Omar Hassan al-Bashir]], the Sudanese president who had resisted UN peacekeepers in Darfur.&lt;ref name=IrishTimes/&gt; While Ban met with [[Mahmoud Abbas]], the Palestinian president, he declined to meet with [[Ismail Haniya]] of [[Hamas]].&lt;ref name="NYT04-03"&gt;{{Cite news|title = On Mideast Trip, U.N.

[[File:Dmitry Medvedev at the 34th G8 Summit 7-9 July 2008-49.jpg|thumb|Ban with [[Angela Merkel]] and [[Dmitry Medvedev]] at the [[34th G8 Summit]], July 2008]]
Ban Ki-moon criticized Israel on 10 March 2008 for planning to build housing units in a [[West Bank settlement]], saying the decision conflicts with "Israel's obligation under the road map" for Middle East peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title =U.N. blasts Israel for West Bank housing expansion plan| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/meast/03/10/israel.palestinian.settlement/index.html|publisher=CNN|date=10 March 2008|accessdate=10 March 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080314233551/http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/meast/03/10/israel.palestinian.settlement/index.html| archivedate= 14 March 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a meeting of the [[UN Security Council]] on Wednesday, 7 January 2009, Ban called for an immediate end to fighting in the [[Gaza Strip]]. He criticized both sides, Israel for bombarding [[Gaza City|Gaza]] and Hamas for firing rockets into Israel.

Although the [[2009 Iranian presidential election]] was widely disputed, Ban Ki-moon sent a traditional congratulation message&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1106757.html "UN toasts Ahmadinejad win, as 69 said killed in Iran protests"], ''Haaretz''.

The [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan Civil War]] began in 2011, the last year of Ban's first term, and dominated his attention and public statements that year. Throughout the conflict, he lobbied for peaceful solutions to the crisis. He frequently spoke out against military action in Libya, believing that a diplomatic solution would be possible and preferable. However, he conceded that if then-leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] refused to abide by a cease fire agreement, the international coalition of military forces would have no choice but to intervene to protect the human rights of Libyans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=The Christian Science Monitor |title=Ban Ki-Moon: I am willing to take any measures for human rights |date=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gaddafi government was eventually overthrown and Gaddafi killed in the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15390980 |title=Muammar Gaddafi: How he died |work=BBC News|date=22 October 2011|accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

======Darfur======
Ban took the first foreign trip of his term to attend the [[African Union]] summit in [[Addis Ababa]], [[Ethiopia]], in January 2007 as part of an effort to reach out to the [[Group of 77]].&lt;ref name="Econ01-06"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Mission impossible?—The United Nations|date = 6 January 2007|work = [[The Economist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He repeatedly identified Darfur as the top humanitarian priority of his administration.&lt;ref name=IrishTimes/&gt; Ban played a large role, with several face-to-face meetings with [[President of Sudan|Sudanese President]] [[Omar Hassan al-Bashir]], in convincing Sudan to allow UN peacekeepers to enter the Darfur region. On 31 July 2007 the United Nations Security Council approved sending 26,000 UN peacekeepers into the region to join 7,000 troops from the African Union. The resolution was heralded as a major breakthrough in confronting the [[War in Darfur|Darfur conflict]] (although the United States labeled the conflict a "[[genocide]]", the United Nations has declined to do so). The first phase of the peacekeeping mission began in October 2007.&lt;ref name="NPR08-02"&gt;{{Cite news|title = United Nations Deploys Peacekeeping Troops to Darfur|author = Cheryl Corley|date = 2 August 2007|work = [[Tell Me More]] on [[National Public Radio|NPR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

======Myanmar======
Ban Ki-moon flew to Myanmar on 25 May 2008 to guide a conference with international agencies aimed at boosting donations for the nation, which was struck by [[Cyclone Nargis]] on 2 May 2008. The conference was initiated after Ban had met with [[Than Shwe]], the leading figure of Myanmar's government 23 May 2008. Ban toured the devastation—especially in the hard-hit [[Irrawaddy Delta]]—23 May 2008 and 24 May 2008. Myanmar officials agreed to allow the [[Yangon International Airport]] to be used as a logistical hub for aid distribution.&lt;ref name="cnn-05-25-08"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Cyclone aid conference opens in Myanmar|publisher = CNN|date = 25 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Cabinet=====
Ban appointed Swedish diplomat [[Jan Eliasson]] as his new Deputy Secretary-General on 2 March 2012. His Chief of Staff is [[Edmond Mulet]] of Guatemala. The appointments were part of Ban's commitment to replace top positions in his group for his second term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://passblue.com/2012/03/04/jan-eliasson-named-deputy-secretary-general/ |title=Jan Eliasson Named Deputy Secretary-General |last=Crossette |first=Barbara |work=PassBlue |date=4 March 2012 |accessdate =26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Key issues=====
Since beginning his second term in January 2012, Ban has focused his public statements and speeches on peace and equality in the Middle East and on equality issues.

======Middle East======
The aftermath of the Libyan Civil War and other events of the [[Arab Spring]] continued to command Ban's attention with the start of his second term. He focused in 2012 on what he termed "intolerance" in the Arab world. After travelling to [[Vienna]] to participate in the opening of the [[KAICIID Dialogue Centre]] to foster interreligious dialogue, Ban commented, "Many countries in the Arab world including Saudi Arabia are changing. Since the Arab Spring, the leaders have begun to listen to the voice of their people." He was however criticised in the Austrian press for associating himself with a project of Saudi [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|King Abdullah]], Saudi Arabia being a location of perceived religious intolerance.&lt;ref name="Die Presse"&gt;{{cite news |title=UN chief interviewed on religious tolerance, Gaza, Palestinian status |author=Christian Ultsch |date=27 November 2012 |work=Die Presse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout 2012, Ban expressed his concern about the continuing [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], in particular the condition of the Palestinian [[Palestinian prisoners in Israel|hunger strikers]] in Israeli prisons&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=41959&amp;Cr=palestin&amp;Cr1= |title=Concerned at plight of Palestinian hunger strikers, Ban urges solution without delay |publisher=United Nations |date=18 October 2011 |accessdate=28 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the movement restrictions imposed on Gaza Strip residents.&lt;ref name="Die Presse"/&gt; On 30 August 2012 Ban criticized the Iranian leadership due to their statements regarding Israel's destruction and denying the Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/31/world/middleeast/ban-ki-moon-broaches-delicate-topics-with-iranian-officials.html |title= Criticizing Iranian leadership statements regarding Israel and the Holocaust |work=The New York Times |date=30 August 2012 |accessdate=30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 August 2013, Ban Ki-moon admitted that the UN was biased against Israel, stating in a meeting with Israeli students that there was a biased attitude towards the Israeli people and Israeli government at the UN. He described this as "an unfortunate situation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4418776,00.html |title=UN chief admits bias against Israel |author=Omri Efraim |date=16 August 2013 |work=Ynet News}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later, he backtracked on the utterance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Israel-disturbed-by-Bans-recanting-comment-on-bias-323732 ''Israel ‘disturbed’ by Ban's recanting comment on bias'']. Jerusalem Post, 20 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt; During an interview on 16 December 2016, Ban said that the UN has issued a "disproportionate volume of resolutions, reports and conferences criticizing Israel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Breaking-News/Ban-Ki-Moon-says-UN-has-disproportionate-focus-on-Israel-475622|title=Ban Ki-Moon says UN has 'disproportionate' focus on Israel|date=16 December 2016|publisher=Jerusalem Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 January 2016, Ban made a statement in relation to the attacks by Palestinians against Israelis. Ban Ki-moon said that "as oppressed peoples have demonstrated throughout the ages, it is human nature to react to occupation, which often serves as a potent incubator of hate and extremism".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Benjamin Netanyahu accuses Ban Ki-moon of justifying terrorism|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/12124107/Benjamin-Netanyahu-accuses-Ban-Ki-moon-of-justifying-terrorism.html|website = Telegraph.co.uk|access-date = 30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In rebuking Ban's statement, the Israeli PM [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] stated that "there is no justification for terror".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Ban has criticized [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen]],&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/10/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-yemen-children-ban-ki-moon.html?_r=0 United Nations Chief Exposes Limits to His Authority by Citing Saudi Threat]".

[[Amnesty International]]. 7 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2016, Ban Ki-moon removed a Saudi-led coalition from a list of [[children's rights]] violators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/10/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-yemen-children-ban-ki-moon.html |title= United Nations Chief Exposes Limits to His Authority by Citing Saudi Threat |work=The New York Times |date=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later admitted that [[Saudi Arabia]] threatened to cut Palestinian aid and funds to other UN programs if coalition was not removed from blacklist for killing children in Yemen. According to one source, there was also a threat of "clerics in Riyadh meeting to issue a [[fatwa]] against the UN, declaring it anti-Muslim, which would mean no contacts of [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|OIC]] members, no relations, contributions, support, to any UN projects, programs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/08/saudi-arabia-united-nations-blacklist-yemen-ban-ki-moon |title=Saudi Arabian allies pressured UN chief to issue blacklist reversal, sources say  |work=The Guardian |date=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====== Ukraine ======
On 26 June 2016, during a speech in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]], Ban said Russia "has a critical role to play" in addressing global issues "from ending the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria, to safeguarding human rights and controlling the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction." His comments were condemned by [[Ukraine|Ukraine's]] UN envoy [[Volodymyr Yelchenko]], saying that he doesn't understand how the UN chief "can say such things which sort of praise the role of Russia in settling the conflict in Ukraine when the Russian Federation is the main player in aggressing Ukraine and in keeping this conflict boiling." He also noted that Russia is being accused of human rights abuses in [[Crimea]] and is "building up the nuclear potential" on the peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/ukraine-un--oputrage-ki-moon-comments-russia/27803380.html|title=Ukraine's UN Envoy 'Outraged' By Ban's Comments On Russia|date=16 June 2016|newspaper=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty|language=English|access-date=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

======LGBT rights======
On 7 March 2012 Ban delivered a speech titled "The Time Has Come" to the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] urging the Council to place greater emphasis on combating [[homophobia]] and promoting [[LGBT rights]] around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Ki-moon|last1=Ban|title=Message to Human Rights Council meeting on Violence and Discrimination based on Sexual Orientation or Gender Identity|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/infocus/sgspeeches/statments_full.asp?statID=1475|website=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt; The speech was met by a protest by a group of delegates, who organized a walk-out protest during the speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/blogs/alloutorg_video_ban_ki_moon_the_time_has_come.html |title=AllOut.org Video: Ban Ki-moon: "The Time Has Come" |publisher=glbtq |date=3 March 2012 |accessdate=25 May 2015 |author=Summers, Claude J. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150525154749/http://www.glbtq.com/blogs/alloutorg_video_ban_ki_moon_the_time_has_come.html |archivedate=25 May 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a speech at the UN headquarters commemorating Human Rights Day, Ban condemned countries with anti-gay laws, mentioning 76 countries that criminalize homosexuality. He said:
:"It is an outrage that in our modern world, so many countries continue to criminalize people simply for loving another human being of the same sex."

Ban has told senior managers that homophobia will not be tolerated. He pointed to countries such as Ukraine which has proposed criminalizing public discussion about homosexuality as threatening basic human rights. He further stated that government has a duty to defend vulnerable minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/sg/statements/index.asp?nid=6504 |title=Secretary-General's remarks to special event on "Leadership in the Fight against Homophobia" |publisher=United Nations |date=11 December 2012 |accessdate=25 May 2015 |author=Ban Ki-moon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2013, he described LGBT rights as one of the great neglected human rights of our time. He also said that religion, culture or tradition can never justify denial of basic rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/sg/STATEMENTS/index.asp?nid=6736 |title=Secretary-General's video message to the Oslo Conference on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity |publisher=United Nations |date=15 April 2013 |accessdate=25 May 2015 |author=Ban Ki-moon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

======Humanitarian action======
{{See also|World Humanitarian Summit}}
On 25 January 2012, Ban announced that he would convene the world's first summit on [[humanitarian aid]] in order to "share knowledge and establish common best practices."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.un.org/sg/STATEMENTS/index.asp?nid=5825 | title=Secretary-General's remarks to the General Assembly on his Five-Year Action Agenda: "The Future We Want" | date=25 January 2012 | accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Known as the [[World Humanitarian Summit]], the event took place in the 23–24 May 2016 in [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]]. In preparation for the summit, Ban released a report on 9 February 2016 titled ‘One Humanity, Shared Responsibility’  in which he laid out an "Agenda for Humanity" based on consultations with more than 23,000 people in 153 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/feb/09/ban-ki-moon-world-un-humanitarian-summit-conflict-leadership | title=Ban Ki-moon: ‘Close the gap between the world that is and the world that should be’ | date=9 February 2016 | accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Agenda for Humanity outlines what is needed to reform humanitarian action, including political leadership to prevent and end conflict, new forms of financing, and a shift from providing aid to ending need. The summit is scheduled to include 5,000 participants, including representatives from governments, NGOs, civil society organizations, and the private sector, as well as individuals affected by humanitarian crises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.trust.org//item/20160111070315-hkcum | title=INTERVIEW-Refugees, warmongers and bloodshed targeted in first global aid summit | date=11 January 2016 | accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticism as UN Secretary-General====
According to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', "some UN employees and delegates" expressed resentment at Ban's perceived [[Cronyism|favoritism]] in the appointment of South Korean nationals in key posts. Previous UN chiefs such as [[Kurt Waldheim]] (Austria), [[Javier Pérez de Cuéllar]] (Peru), and [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]] (Egypt) brought small teams of trusted aides or clerical workers from their country's Foreign Ministry, and South Korean nationals have been historically underrepresented at the United Nations.&lt;ref name=fav/&gt; Nonetheless, according to "some officials" in the ''Post'' story, Ban had allegedly gone further, boosting South Korea's presence in UN ranks by more than 20 percent during his first year in office. In response, Ban and his aides stated that the allegations of favoritism are wrong, and that some of the harshest criticisms against him have undercurrents of [[racism]].&lt;ref name=fav/&gt; He said that the South Korean nationals he had appointed—including [[Choi Young-jin]], who had already served as a high-ranking official in the United Nations' peacekeeping department—are highly qualified for their positions. Others such as Donald P. Gregg, a former U.S. ambassador to South Korea, said that the complaints were driven by [[envy]]: "I think being from South Korea, and people have growing respect for South Korea, that's a great enhancement for the secretary general. If he brings along talented people who he knows very well, I think that's also a plus." UN records show that South Korea, the organization's eleventh-largest financial contributor, had only 54 South Korean nationals assigned to its mission six months before Ban took over the top UN post. By contrast, the [[Philippines]], a significantly poorer country, had 759 nationals in its mission.&lt;ref name=fav&gt;{{Cite news|title = Under U.N.

Former UN Under Secretary General for Oversight Services [[Inga-Britt Ahlenius]] denounced Ban Ki-moon after resigning her post in 2010, calling him "reprehensible".&lt;ref name=fav/&gt; Ahlenius claimed that the Secretary-General made efforts to undermine the [[Office of Internal Oversight Services]] (OIOS) mandate and challenge its operational independence.&lt;ref&gt;[[Inga-Britt Ahlenius]], [http://ipsterraviva.net/uploads/UN/UN/report.Pdf End of Assignment Report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821155047/http://ipsterraviva.net/uploads/UN/UN/report.Pdf |date=21 August 2010 }}, 14 July 2010, p. 22.

Nambiar further noted that Ban "fully recognizes the operational independence of OIOS, [but that] does not excuse [Ahlenius] from applying the standard rules of recruitment".&lt;ref name=fav/&gt;

American diplomat [[James Wasserstrom]] claimed that Ban attempted to limit the jurisdiction of the [[United Nations Dispute Tribunal|UN dispute tribunal]] following Wasserstrom's dismissal from his Kosovo post and lengthy appeals process.&lt;ref&gt;Borger, Julian (2012) [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/27/un-tribunal-whistleblower-james-wasserstrom "UN tribunal finds ethics office failed to protect whistleblower"]. ''The Guardian''&lt;/ref&gt; Ban had refused to hand over confidential documents relating to the case to the UN personnel tribunal, despite repeated orders by the court to do so. In relation to another case, Ban was admonished by Judge Michael Adams for "willful disobedience" for again refusing to hand over key documents in an internal promotions dispute.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, Colum (13 May 2010), [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/12/AR2010051204868.html "U.N. Head Ban Ki-Moon Refusing Orders from Internal Personnel Court"], ''The Washington Post''. Retrieved 20 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Ban was accused of undermining collective bargaining rights of The Staff Coordinating Council, the union representing United Nations staff.  Ban unilaterally eliminated the role of the union to negotiate on behalf of the employees and terminated talks when the union protested.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, M. (17 September 2013), "Ban Ki Moon Accused of Union Busting at UN", ''Huffington Post''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ban was named in a lawsuit challenging UN legal immunity on behalf of Haitian cholera victims in the U.S. District Court of Manhattan. UN peacekeepers from Nepal are said to be the source of the [[2010–13 Haiti cholera outbreak]]. Ban declared that the legal immunity of the United Nations before national courts should be upheld, but that this does not reduce the UN's moral responsibility to overcome Haiti's cholera epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, Armin (9 April 2015), [http://www.businessinsider.com/cholera-outbreak-in-haiti-and-the-un-2015-4 "How the UN caused a massive cholera outbreak in Haiti"], ''Business Insider''.

===2017 presidential candidacy speculation===

Until the outbreak of the [[2016 South Korean political scandal]], Ban was the leading potential candidate for [[President of South Korea]] in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=FocusNews|title=Ban Ki-moon|url=http://www.focus.kr/view.php?key=2016090200202827112|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927082554/http://www.focus.kr/view.php?key=2016090200202827112|archivedate=27 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, recent polls showed [[Moon Jae-in]] of the main opposition [[Minjoo Party of Korea]] in the lead with a support rating of 32.8 percent, while Ban trailed in distant second with 15.4 percent.

During his tenure at the South Korean Foreign Ministry, Ban's nickname was ''jusa'' (주사), meaning "the administrative clerk".

'''Belgrade Cooperative''' ({{lang-sr|Београдска задруга}}) was a [[Cooperative banking|cooperative bank]] founded in 1882 to promote savings and support small enterprises, craftspeople and the poor of [[Belgrade]]. Member-shareholders have been paying membership in amount of one [[Serbian dinar|Serbian Dinar]] per week. That is the way for cooperative to become a public savings bank. [[Luka Ćelović]] was the first president of cooperative, also a first Serbian insurance group.

== History ==
The construction of Belgrade Cooperative coincided with the change of political regime in Serbia. After the assassination of the king [[Aleksandar Obrenović]], the [[Karađorđević dynasty|Karadjordjevic dynasty]] came to power, which led to a change in the system of governance. [[Autocracy|Autocratic]] regime was replaced by [[Bourgeoisie|liberal bourgeois]] regime of [[Peter I of Serbia|Petar the I]], the [[civil liberties]] were increased and the economic situation was improved.

"Belgrade cooperative for mutual help and savings" was founded in 1882 at the initiative of a group of Belgrade merchants, with the idea of investing into [[Economy of Serbia|Serbia economy]]. This type of investment was a modern form of credit and an advanced method for reviving both the trading business and the market within the [[Capitalism|capitalist]] economy. 
Since 1897, when the Department of Insurance was founded, in addition to the cooperative banking activity, Belgrade Cooperative was increasingly developed as an insurance company. From being the savings fund and loaning money to the small proprietors, the Cooperative developed into the strong financial organization which loaned money to the city and state. Branches were open in [[Skopje]] and [[Thessaloniki]].&lt;ref name="mikser"&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author = Daliborka Mučibabić | title = „Mikser” osvetlio savamalsku lepoticu | newspaper = [[Politika]] | pages = | language = Serbian | date = 17 June 2012 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/222740/Mikser-osvetlio-savamalsku-lepoticu }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As such, it operated until 1944, representing one of the most important institutions of its kind. Some of the most important figures of economic and financial life of Serbia were once acting as a president of Belgrade Cooperative - its organizer and principal job coordinator, Luka Ćelović, subsequent donor and benefactor of [[Belgrade University]], [[Kosta Taušanović]] and Lazar Paču, the financial leaders of Serbia of their time, public figures, prominent politicians and statesmen, as well as other well-known Belgrade businessmen, [[Đorđe Vajfert]], Dimitirije Ćirković and others.

At the regular shareholders meeting in 1897, it was decided that a new building will be erected and so multiple properties were bought belonging to Krsmanović brothers, Gođevac brothers, Municipality of Belgrade, Vuja Ranković and Luka Ćelović, in close vicinity to the so-called Little Market on the Sava River. The construction began in the spring of 1905 and was completed in 1907, in the record time for that period.&lt;ref name="Politika"&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author = Daliborka Mućibabić | title = Nema para za Beogradsku zadrugu| newspaper = [[Politika]] | pages = | language = Serbian | date = 4 September 2011| url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The building ==

[[File:Beogradska zadruga-03.jpg|thumb|210px|Interior of the building]]

Belgrade Cooperative Building was built according to the project by two leading Belgrade architects, University professors, [[Andra Stevanović]] and [[Nikola Nestorović]]. The majority of the building was constructed on the old embankment, and since the land was underwater due to the proximity of the river, the foundation of many walls has to be made of reinforced concrete, the first time in Belgrade,&lt;ref name="Politika"/&gt; but using the iron for clamps, since there were was no round iron in Belgrade at the time.

The contractors of construction works were brothers Stok. All cut stone materials were made by the "Industry of [[Ripanj#Characteristics|Ripanj granite]]." Decorations on the facades and interior, with rich decorative plastic in stucco on the walls and on the ceiling, are work of Franja Valdman, the sculptor of building ornaments.

Decorative paintings in the main entrance are work of Bora Kovačević and Andrea Domenico, while the paintings on glass were made by R. Marković.

Belgrade cooperative moved into the new building immediately after the completion of construction in 1907 and remained there until its abolition.

The building was later used by the Geological Geophysical Institute "Jovan Žujović".

The social status of the Belgrade Cooperative dictated that the representativeness and monumentality become the only possible [[Architecture|architectural]] concept.

[[File:Beogradska zadruga Karadjordjeva 48 21 svecana sala.jpg|thumb|left|210px|Ceremonial hall]]

It was designed in the style of academism, with elements borrowed from both eclectic academic style, as well as contemporary Art Nouveau architecture. It was built as a monumental corner building with three wings in the floor plan at the irregular plot. The most representative part of the building is the prominent and jagged central part, where the public rooms are located, with the main facade in Karadjordjeva Street. The wings in Travnička and Hercegovačka Streets in which the workrooms are located have simple facades with uniform peaceful rhythm and different composition in every elevation. The central wing facing the street has two floors – the entrance and the ceremonial hall with the vestibule that extends through two floors and one storey Counter hall in the rear, while both side wings have a ground floor and two floors. Shops were once located on the ground floor of the side wings while the administrative and management offices were on the first floor.

The Belgrade Cooperative building was built using mixed techniques. Cellars, which extend beneath the entire building, are made of reinforced concrete, with Prussian vaults. Most of the building was built using a standard procedure, brick in lime mortar, and only partly in reinforced concrete. Bridging is architrave for the side wings, and the architrave and arch in the middle wing. Lantern construction above the central staircase is resolved in the form of triangular metal grille. Roofs have jamb walls, small slope and domes. Façade which is facing the street is made in stone slabs in socle zone and dressed in artificial stone, while the courtyard façade is plastered.

Structural system has vaults and marble columns. Main staircases are three-armed, stone or marble, while side staircases are spiral and iron. The interior walls are plastered and painted, while the representative rooms are decorated with wall paintings and marble imitation and have pilasters with gilded capitals and applied polychrome decorative female masks. The floors have parquet or terrazzo tiles. On the facades decoration was made of artificial stone, while the interior is in stucco and plaster.

[[File:Beogradska zadruga (2014, by night).jpg|thumb|210px|Building by night, after the reconstruction]]

All the decorative motifs of Belgrade Cooperative Building are borrowed from post [[Renaissance]], predominantly [[Baroque]], but modernly interpreted to form the unique style expression. Frontal facade is dominated by the large glass surface above which is a dome with merlon flanked by sculptural group consisting of a female figure, the personification of Serbia and four children's figures that embody the Industry. In the niches on the side projections of the main façade are the figures of a Woman with beehive and a Man with a scroll. Inside the building in the main hall, at the beginning of the staircase there are two counterpart figures of a young woman in the form of a chandelier. Above the gallery in the main hall there is a sculptural group consisting of a female figure with a crown, again a symbol of Serbia and two children figures representing the insurance and banking. Metal figure, probably an import, is gilded, as well as all stucco decoration. On the top of pilaster strips, above the windows of the first floor and in the amount of ground-floor windows on the side walls there is a number of reliefs in the form of female masks, while the mask of Mercury is positioned above the entrance.
The unity of architecture and applied decorative arts in the interior of the Belgrade Cooperative building is clearly visible. That kind of unity is particularly valued in European architecture from the late 19th and early 20th century and is known as the "synthesis of art". This "synthesis of art" is extremely rare in Belgrade architecture and it makes Belgrade Cooperative building a unique creation. 
Each of the decorative elements, such as the paintings on the walls and ceilings, sculptures, stucco decorations, chandeliers and appliqué on the walls, painted glass parapet at the Counter-hall or glass surfaces of windows and doors of the main hall, are distinctive features which is why Belgrade Cooperative became a cultural monument in 1966.

The building is often named as one of the most beautiful buildings in Belgrade.&lt;ref name="Politika"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author = Mihajlo Mitrović | title = Najzad, Savamala | newspaper = Politika | pages = | language = Serbian | date = | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reconstruction ==

Belgrade Cooperative Building was renovated several times. The most important changes in the construction and architectural structure were made in 1956/57 and 1958/59. During those years, the Geological Geophysical Institute made a decision to extend the building by adding the third floor above both wings in Travnička and Hercegovačka streets, and then three floors above the central wing in the yard around the former Counter hall. These extensions altered the general appearance of the building by removing the wing’s domes, the attic became floor, windows and doors in the ground floor were walled up and shop doors become windows of offices. Merlon was removed from the central dome as well as the clock from the main façade. The Counter-hall inside the block remained on the ground floor and it was lit through light well.

Belgrade Cooperative is one of the most significant buildings in Belgrade and [[Architecture of Serbia|Serbian architecture]] in the first decade of the 20th century and one of the most successful achievements of architects Andra Stevanović and Nikola Nestorović. Architectural concept, compliance of building’s functional and compositional elements, rich sculptural and decorative plastics, style consistency, construction quality, new construction methods used for the first time, new materials and other architectural features put this building among the most representative palaces in Belgrade architecture. Belgrade Cooperative building is one of the few buildings that represent the beginning of the modern reconstruction of Belgrade along the Sava embankment. Belgrade Cooperative Building is a [[cultural monument]] of value for the [[Serbia|Republic of Serbia]] since 1979 (Decision, "Službeni glasnik SRS" no. 14/79).

City's Institute for the protection of the cultural monuments drafted the reconstruction project for the building in 2009.&lt;ref name="Politika"/&gt; Authored by Aleksandra Šević and Ljiljana Konta, the project was to include the complete rebuilding of the, today non-existing, two side domes. They were to be built of wood and steel and look the same as the small domes on the head façade. Deteriorated sculpture on the front dome was to be removed and replaced by the new one, made of metal. A mast, which once stood on the central dome, will also be rebuilt and also serve as the [[lightning rod]]. Due to the lack of funds, the project didn't went on.&lt;ref name="Politika"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3222">The '''Beutelsbach Consensus''' constitutes a kind of minimum standard of [[Civics|civic]]  (''Politische Bildung'') and [[religious education]] (''Religionsunterricht'') in [[Germany]]. It was developed in the frame of a conference at a small town called [[Beutelsbach (Weinstadt)|Beutelsbach]]  to reanimate the exchange of different didactic schools after a period of deep conflicts. Until today Beutelsbach Consensus is of high importance.

==Main clauses==
=== Prohibition against Overwhelming the Pupil===
It is not permissible to catch pupils unprepared or unaware - by whatever means - for the sake of imparting desirable opinions and to hinder them from `forming an independent judgment’. It is precisely at this point that the dividing line runs between political education and indoctrination. Indoctrination is incompatible with the role of a teacher in a democratic society and the universally accepted objective of making pupils capable of [[Freedom of religion in Germany|independent judgment]] (Mündigkeit).

===Treating Controversial Subjects as Controversial===
Matters which are controversial in intellectual and political affairs must also be taught as controversial in educational instruction. This demand is very closely linked with the first point above, for if differing points of view are lost sight of, options suppressed, and alternatives remain undiscussed, then the path to indoctrination is being trodden. We have to ask whether teachers have in fact a corrective role to play. That is, whether they should or should not specially set out such points of view and alternatives which are foreign to the social and political origins of pupils (and other participants in programs of political education).
In affirming this second basic principle, it becomes clear why the personal standpoint of teachers, the intellectual and theoretical views they represent and their political opinions are relatively uninteresting. To repeat an example that has already been given: their understanding of democracy presents no problems, for opinions contrary to theirs are also being taken into account.

===Giving Weight to the Personal Interests of Pupils===
Pupils must be put in a position to analyse a political situation and to assess how their own personal interests are affected as well as to seek means and ways to influence the political situation they have identified according to their personal interests. Such an objective brings a strong emphasis on the acquisition of the necessary operational skills, which is in turn a logical consequence of the first two principles set out above. In this connection the reproach is sometimes made that this is a `return to formalism’, so that teachers do not have to correct the content of their own beliefs. This is not the case since what is involved here is not a search for a maximum consensus, but the search for a minimal consensus.

The '''Chemical Diversion and Trafficking Act''' of 1988 was an amendment to the [[Controlled Substances Act]] to regulate [[wiktionary:Precursor|precursor]] chemicals, essential chemicals, tableting machines, and encapsulating machines by imposing record keeping and import/export reporting requirements on transactions involving these materials. Prior to these restrictions being put in place, the U.S. had been the primary source of chemicals used in [[South America]]n cocaine manufacture. According to the DEA, the Act sharply reduced these precursor exports and cocaine manufacturers responded by purchasing from chemical suppliers outside the U.S. The U.S. in turn successfully lobbied for inclusion of chemical controls in the 1988 [[United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances]], which included two Tables of controlled precursors.

The '''Christian Democratic Party''' ({{Lang-fr|Parti chrétien-démocrate}}, PCD) is a [[Conservatism|conservative]] [[Christian Democracy|Christian-democratic]] party in [[France]]. The party was known as the '''Forum of Social Republicans''' (FRS) between 2001 and June 2009 before being adopting its current name.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-actu/2009/06/20/01011-20090620FILWWW00606-boutin-cree-le-parti-chretien-democrate.php&lt;/ref&gt; The party was founded by [[Christine Boutin]].

The FRS was established in March 2001 as a [[social conservative]] faction within the Christian democratic [[Union for French Democracy]] (UDF) and emerged as an independent party in December of the same year, when Boutin announced her candidacy in the [[French presidential election, 2002]], in contrast with UDF leader and official candidate [[François Bayrou]], and was consequently expelled.

In 2005, the FRS called for a NO vote in the referendum over the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe]].

The PCD is a Christian democratic social conservative party, opposed to [[gay marriage]], [[abortion]] and [[euthanasia]].

The PCD is an associate party of the [[Union for a Popular Movement]] and is a member of the [[Liaison Committee for the Presidential Majority]].

Since November 2013, [[Jean-Frédéric Poisson]] has been the new president of the party.&lt;ref name="president2013"&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2013/11/16/jean-frederic-poisson-succede-a-christine-boutin-a-la-tete-du-parti-chretien-democrate_3515120_823448.html#xtor=RSS-320800 Jean-Frédéric Poisson succède à Christine Boutin à la tête du Parti chrétien-démocrate]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elected officials==

*'''Deputies:''', [[Dino Cinieri]] ([[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]] group)&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean-Frédéric Poisson]] was deputy, in replacement of Christine Boutin, nominated to the cabinet, until she left the government in June 2009, at which date she was eligible to retrieve her seat. She did not wish to do so, therefore a by-election will be held.&lt;/ref&gt;

The party also claims 9,500 members as of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061126192435/http://www.frs-ladroitehumaine.fr/frontoffice/chiffres-clefs.r15046_l1.htm Key Numbers, frs-ladroitehumaine.fr]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Climate bonds''' (also known as '''green bonds''') are fixed-income financial instruments ([[Bond (finance)|bonds]]) linked in some way to climate change solutions.

Climate bonds are a relatively new asset class, but they are growing rapidly.&lt;ref name=Hulmann&gt;Yves Hulmann, [https://www.letemps.ch/economie/2016/12/20/2016-lannee-lessor-obligations-vertes "2016, l’année de l’essor des obligations vertes"], ''[[Le temps]]'', 20 December 2016 (page visited on 20 December 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; The total volume of climate bonds was estimated at 160 billions of dollars on 2016; of which 70 billions were issued in 2016.&lt;ref name=Hulmann/&gt;

Voters in the City of [[San Francisco]] approved a [[revenue bond]] authority in 2001, in the form of a city charter amendment (Section 9.107.8) known as the "[[solar bonds]]," to finance renewable energy and energy conservation measures on homes, businesses and government buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/may/17/local/me-64622|title=San Francisco Envisions a Solar City|work=latimes.com|access-date=2001-05-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign for solar bonds, Proposition H, was motivated by the need for the city to take meaningful action on [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.local.org/yesonhf.html|title=San Francisco Proposition H Flyer referencing Global Warming|work=local.org|access-date=2001-06-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The solar bond authority was being used as part of the city's renewable energy program, administered by the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission, [[CleanPowerSF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sfbos.org/ftp/uploadedfiles/bdsupvrs/ordinances12/o0114-12.pdf|title=San Francisco Board of Supervisors ordinance authorizing issuance of revenue bonds under the solar bond authority, charter section 9.107.8 |work=sfbos.org|accessdate=2012-06-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

European Investment Bank (EIB) issued an equity index-linked bond in 2007, which became the first fixed income product among socially responsible investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_BEI-13-109_en.htm|title=European Commission - PRESS RELEASES  - Press release - EIB launches largest EUR Climate Awareness Bond (CAB) ever|website=europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; This “Climate Awareness Bond” structure was used to fund renewable energy and energy efficiency projects. Afterwards, The World Bank became first in the world to issue a labelled “green bond” in 2008, which followed a conventional “plain vanilla” bond structure, contrary to EIB’s equity-linked Climate Awareness Bond.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2015/10/01/green-bonds-access-investor-capital-to-fight-climate-change|title=Green Bonds Access Investor Capital to Fight Climate Change|work=World Bank|access-date=2018-01-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The green bond market has subsequently increased rapidly in issuance. From 2015 to 2016, the Climate Bonds Initiative reports that there was a 92% increase in green bonds issuance to $92 billion,&lt;ref&gt;Climate Bonds Initiative (2017). https://www.climatebonds.net/files/files/2016%20GB%20Market%20Roundup.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; with different types of issuers starting to issue green bonds. Apple, for example, became the first tech company to issue a green bond in 2016, and Poland became the first sovereign country to issue a green bond at the end of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessgreen.com/bg/news/3001118/poland-becomes-first-sovereign-state-to-issue-a-green-bond|title=Poland becomes first sovereign state to issue a green bond|work=businessgreen.com|access-date=2018-01-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

Climate bonds are issued in order to raise finance for climate change solutions: [[climate change mitigation]] or [[Climate change adaptation|adaptation]] related projects or programs. These might be greenhouse gas emission reduction projects ranging from [[clean energy]] to [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], or climate change adaptation projects ranging from building [[Nile]] delta flood defences or helping the [[Great Barrier Reef]] adapt to warming waters.

Like normal bonds, climate bonds can be issued by governments, multi-national banks or corporations. The issuing entity guarantees to repay the bond over a certain period of time, plus either a fixed or variable rate of return.&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Theme Bonds: a major new Asset Class brewing, excerpt from Sustainable Banking – Risk and Opportunity in Financing the Future, edited by Joti Mangat, published by Thomson Reuters 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Most climate bonds are [[Asset-backed security|asset-backed]], or [[ringfenced]], with investors being promised that all funds raised will only go to specified climate-related programs or assets, such as renewable energy plants or climate mitigation focused funding programs.&lt;ref&gt;Mathews, Kidney, Mallon, Hughes. Mobilizing private finance to drive an energy industrial revolution. [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421510001114 Energy Policy] 38 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

In their [[UNEP]] paper on investors and climate change, Mackenzie and Ascui&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie, C and Ascui. F. [http://www.unpri.org/files/climate.pdf Investor leadership on climate change: an analysis of the investment community’s role on climate change, and snapshot of recent investor activity]. Published by the UNEP Finance Initiative and UNPRI, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; differentiate a climate bond from a [[green bond]]:
“(A climate bond is) an extension of the [[green bond]] concept. Green bonds are issued [...] in order to raise the finance for an environmental project. Climate bonds [are] issued [...] to raise finance for investments in emission reduction or climate change adaptation.”

The London-based [https://web.archive.org/web/20141202000944/http://www.climatebonds.net/standards Climate Bond Standards Board] provides a certification program for climate bonds.

Climate bonds are [[wikt:theme|theme]] bonds,&lt;ref&gt;Iggo, C. ''Climate Bonds: a major new asset class brewing'' http://www.axa-im.com/index.cfm?pagepath=research/ri_inside_research/green_initiative&amp;CFNoCache=TRUE&amp;servedoc=82A0C89C-1708-7D7E-1BEE7FCB1BA8F25F {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110305055123/http://www.axa-im.com/index.cfm?pagepath=research%2Fri_inside_research%2Fgreen_initiative# |date=2011-03-05 }}. Published by AXA Investment Managers&lt;/ref&gt; similar in principle to a railway bond of the 19th century, the war bonds of the early 20th century or the highway bond of the 1960s. Theme bonds are designed to:
* Allow [[Institutional investor|institutional capital]] - pension, government, insurance and [[sovereign wealth fund]]s - to invest in areas seen as politically important to their [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s that have the same credit risk and returns profile as standards bonds.
* Provide a means for governments to direct funding to climate change mitigation. For example, this might be done by choosing to privilege qualifying bonds with preferential tax treatments.
* Send a political signal to other stakeholders.

Otherwise, for operational purposes, theme bonds largely function as conventional debt instruments. They are [[Risk-weighted asset|risk-weighted]] and [[Credit rating|credit rated]] in the usual way based on the creditworthiness of the issuer, and tradable, market conditions permitting, in [[Bond market|international secondary bond markets]]. These instruments can theoretically be issued at all levels of the [[Bond market|fixed income market]], from sovereigns to corporate.

==Benefits of green bonds==
The growth of bond markets provides increasing opportunities to 
finance the implementation of the [[Sustainable Development Goals]], Nationally Determined Contributions and other green growth projects. Green bonds are becoming an increasingly prevalent form of green finance, particularly for clean and sustainable infrastructure development and their large funding needs. They offer a vehicle to both access finance from the capital markets and deliver green impacts that can be verified against standards. In developing countries, green bonds are already financing critical projects, including renewable energy, 
urban mass transit systems and water distribution.&lt;ref name="GUIDE: New markets for green bonds"&gt;[https://cdkn.org/resource/guide-new-markets-green-bonds-2/?loclang=en_gb GUIDE: New markets for green bonds], the Climate and Development Knowledge Network, accessdate 25 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Green bonds mobilised over $93 billion in 2016 to projects and assets with positive environmental impacts. At the current growth rate, they could mobilise over $200 billion in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-Global-green-bond-issuance-could-rise-to-USD206B-in--PR_360880?WT.mc_id=AM~WWFob29fRmluYW5jZV9TQl9SYXRpbmcgTmV3c19BbGxfRW5n~20170118_PR_360880 Global green bond issuance could rise to USD206B in 2017 after record in 2016], New York, NY: Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. accessdate 25 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Of total global bond issuance, however, this is still around just 1%.&lt;ref name="GUIDE: New markets for green bonds"/&gt;

According to a report by the [[Climate and Development Knowledge Network]] (CDKN) and [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]], a green bond market has three key benefits to a country and its environmental goals and commitments.

*It increases the finance available for green projects, therefore incentivising an increase in their number. Today, green bonds mainly finance projects within renewable energy, energy efficiency, low-carbon transport, sustainable water, and waste and pollution.
*It is a viable vehicle for enabling the increasing pool of sustainable investors to access environmental projects. Bonds are an instrument and an approach with which foreign investors are familiar, so these institutions need little new understanding or capacity. Investors are also interested in placing money where the environmental impact achieved is highest per unit of currency, and emerging and developing economies have the potential to offer this where lower project costs exist. 
*It can be a catalyst for further development of the domestic capital market and financial system more broadly beyond environmentally related projects.&lt;ref name="GUIDE: New markets for green bonds"/&gt;

==Demand for green bonds==
The Business and Sustainable Development Commission describes at least US$12 trillion in market opportunities for business from sustainable business models.&lt;ref&gt;[http://report.businesscommission.org/uploads/BetterBiz-BetterWorld.pdf Better business, better world: The report of the Business &amp; Sustainable Development Commission], accessdate 25 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations estimates an annual funding gap of $2.5 trillion is needed for the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.innpact.com/_dbfiles/lacentrale_files/200/290/ada-sustainable-development-bonds-a4-final.pdf Sustainable development bonds] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223030843/http://www.innpact.com/_dbfiles/lacentrale_files/200/290/ada-sustainable-development-bonds-a4-final.pdf# |date=2017-02-23 }} EIIL, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and within this, US$1 trillion is needed annually for clean energy alone. A large number and broad range of projects and assets that contribute to achieving the 17 SDGs need this funding for their development and operation.

One of the SDGs where ‘green finance’ has been successfully mobilised is on clean energy and climate action. The Paris Agreement on climate change entered into force in November 2016, after 196 countries committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Significant quantities of finance are now needed to convert country commitments (Nationally Determined Contributions, NDCs) to implementation and a low-carbon, climate-resilient economy.

Despite recent increases in volumes of climate finance, a significant funding gap will arise unless new sources and channels of finance are mobilised.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unep.org/adaptationgapreport/sites/unep.org.adaptationgapreport/files/documents/agr2016.pdf Finance gap: the adaptation report], United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), accessdate 25 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Existing international public finance dedicated to climate change is unable to achieve the rapid change required in meeting the finance gap alone. Furthermore, public sector balance sheets do not have the capacity to fund the amounts needed, and so an estimated 80–90% of funding will need to come from the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.environmental-finance.com/content/analysis/cop-blog-the-role-of-the-green-climate-fund-in-providing-the-missing-clean-trillion.html The role of the Green Climate Fund in providing the missing “clean trillion”], COP Blog, Environmental Finance, accessdate 25 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Bank balance sheets can take only a proportion of the private finance needed so the capital markets have to be leveraged, along with other sources such as insurance and peer-to-peer.

According to [https://cdkn.org/resource/guide-new-markets-green-bonds-2/?loclang=en_gb GUIDE: New markets for green bonds], the demand for green bonds has grown quickly on the investor side, with asset owners and managers diversifying their investment portfolios and seeking positive impact beyond financial return. In the light of the global commitment to shift to a green and low-carbon economy, the green bond market has the potential to grow substantially, while attracting more diverse issuers and investors.

== Criticism and controversies ==
The green bond market has attracted international criticism with some questioning the green credentials of certain bonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Matsuzaki |first1=Yusuke |title=Environmental bonds stained by 'green washing' |url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Markets/Capital-Markets/Environmental-bonds-stained-by-green-washing |website=Nikkei Asian Review |accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This criticism pertains both to the projects that are funded, as well as the sustainability credentials of the issuers. In May 2017, the Climate Bonds Initiative refused to list a “green” bond issued by Repsol. The bonds proceeds would be allocated to initiatives meant to improve the efficiency of the company’s oil and gas production operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Whiley |first1=Andrew |title=An oil &amp; gas bond we knew would come eventually: Repsol: Good on GBPs, not so sure on green credentials |url=https://www.climatebonds.net/2017/05/oil-gas-bond-we-knew-would-come-eventually-repsol-good-gbps-not-so-sure-green-credentials |website=Climate Bonds Initiative |accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NGO argued that - even though the projects would reduce CO2 emissions - the company’s sustainability strategy did not go far enough from an environmental perspective to classify it as green. This criticism was extended to Vigeo Eiris, the ratings agency which certified the Repsol bond’s green credentials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Whiley |first1=Andrew |title=An oil &amp; gas bond we knew would come eventually: Repsol: Good on GBPs, not so sure on green credentials |url=https://www.climatebonds.net/2017/05/oil-gas-bond-we-knew-would-come-eventually-repsol-good-gbps-not-so-sure-green-credentials |website=Climate Bonds Initiative |accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Vigeo Eiris was involved in another green bond controversy. The ratings agency was targeted by Western Sahara Resource Watch, an NGO backed by a Norwegian trade union, after it certified a green bond that would fund the production of solar projects by a Moroccan government agency in the illegally occupied territory of Western Sahara.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Vigeo Eiris shock: from ethics to occupation |url=https://www.wsrw.org/a105x3765 |website=Western Sahara Resource Watch |accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="59193">A '''Communist front organization''' is an organization identified as a [[front organization]] under the effective control of a [[Communist party]], the [[Communist International]] or other Communist organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Sheila Suess Kennedy, ''Free Expression in America: A Documentary History'' (Greenwood Press, 1999) pp. 111-122.&lt;/ref&gt; They attracted politicized individuals who were not Party members but who often followed the Party line and were called [[Fellow traveller]]s.

[[Lenin]] originated the idea in his manifesto of 1902, "[[What Is to Be Done?]]". Since the party was illegal in Russia, he proposed to reach the masses through "a large number of other organizations intended for wide membership and, which, therefore, can be as loose and as public as possible,"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Theodore Draper, ''American Communism and Soviet Russia'' (2003)  p 172&lt;/ref&gt; Generally called "mass organizations" by the Communists themselves,&lt;ref&gt;Donald Hindley, ''The Communist Party of Indonesia 1951-1963'' (1966) p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; these groups were prevalent from the 1920s through the 1950s, with their use accelerating during the [[Popular Front]] period of the 1930s.  The term has also been used to refer to organizations not originally Communist-controlled which after a time became so, such as the [[American Student Union]]. The term was especially used by [[Anti-communism|anti-communists]] during the [[Cold War]] (1947-1991).

[[Mao Zedong]] broke bitterly with the Soviet Union in the late 1950s. He set up a network of pro-Chinese, anti-Soviet parties and Communist fronts that directly challenged the pro-Soviet organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alaba Ogunsanwo|title=China's Policy in Africa 1958-71|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Dn0fbuz4mEC&amp;pg=PA96|year=1974|publisher=Cambridge UP|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the leadership of [[Grigory Zinoviev]] in the Kremlin, established fronts in many countries in the 1920s and after.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Service, ''Comrades!: a history of world communism'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; To coordinate their activities the [[Communist International]] (Comintern) set up various international umbrella organizations (linking groups across national borders), such as the [[Young Communist International]] (youth), [[Profintern]] (trade unions),&lt;ref&gt;Ian Birchall, "Profintern: Die Rote Gewerkschaftsinternationale 1920–1937," ''Historical Materialism,'' 2009, Vol. 17 Issue 4, pp 164-176, review (in English) of a German language study by Reiner Tosstorff.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Krestintern]] (peasants), [[International Red Aid]] (humanitarian aid), [[Sportintern]] (organized sports), etc.  In Europe, front organizations were especially influential in Italy&lt;ref&gt;Joan Urban, ''Moscow and the Italian Communist Party: from Togliatti to Berlinguer'' (1986) p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; and France, which in 1933 became the base for Communist front organizer [[Willi Münzenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;Julian Jackson, ''The Popular Front in France'' (1990) p. x&lt;/ref&gt;  These organizations were dissolved the late 1930s or early 1940s.

Communist fronts typically attracted well-known and prestigious  artists, intellectuals and other "fellow travelers" who were used to advance Party positions. Often they came to the USSR for closely controlled tours, then returned home to praise the future as revealed in the Soviet experiment.&lt;ref&gt;Michael David‐Fox, "The Fellow Travelers Revisited: The 'Cultured West' through Soviet Eyes," ''Journal of Modern History'' (2003) 75#2 pp. 300-335 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/380140 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kennedy (1957), after the war, especially as the [[Cold War]] took effect around 1947, the Kremlin set up new international coordination bodies including the [[World Federation of Democratic Youth]], [[International Union of Students]], [[World Federation of Trade Unions]], [[Women's International Democratic Federation]], and the [[World Peace Council]]. Kennedy says the, "Communist 'front' system included such international organizations as the WFTU, WFDY, IUS, WIDF and WPC, besides a host of lesser bodies bringing journalists, lawyers, scientists, doctors and others into the widespread net."&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Kennedy, ''History of Communism in East Asia'' (Praeger Publishers, 1957) p 126&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Federation of Resistance Fighters – Association of Anti-Fascists]] (FIR) was designated by government agencies as a communist-influenced organization.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.org/details/frontorgs Facts about international Communist front organisations (1958)]'' S. 85–86&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Federation of Scientific Workers]] (WFSW) is an international federation of scientific associations. It was a [[Cold War]]-era Communist front.&lt;ref name="Budenz1977"&gt;{{cite book|author=Louis Francis Budenz|title=The techniques of communism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IkqboMAiCkkC&amp;pg=PA242|accessdate=25 March 2012|date=1 June 1977|publisher=Ayer Publishing|isbn=978-0-405-09942-7|pages=242–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="communist propaganda techniques"&gt;{{cite book|title=communist propaganda techniques|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sSwOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA112|accessdate=25 March 2012|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|pages=112–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group was composed of scientists who supported [[communism]].&lt;ref name="Budenz1977"/&gt; The federation opposed [[nuclear test]]s conducted by the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Wittner1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lawrence S.

The [[Union for repatriation of Russians abroad]] was Soviet [[front organization]] aimed at infiltration and control of the exiled community of [[White movement|White Russians]].&lt;ref name=Schwartz&gt;[[Stephen Suleyman Schwartz|Stephen Schwartz]] (January 24, 1988).

The [[International Organization of Journalists]] (IOJ) was one of dozen front organizations launched by the Soviet Union in the late 1940s and early 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffrey T.

James Aulich, Marta Sylvestrová. p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Federation of Trade Unions]] (WFTU) was established in 1945 to unite trade union confederations across the world; it was based in Prague. While it had non-Communist unions it was largely dominated by the Soviets. In 1949 the British, American and other non-Communist unions broke away to form the rival [[International Confederation of Free Trade Unions]]. The labor movement in Europe became so polarized between the Communists unions and the Social Democratic and Christian labor unions, and front operations could no longer hide the sponsorship and they became less important.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Carew, "The Schism within the World Federation of Trade Unions: Government and Trade-Union Diplomacy," ''International Review of Social History,'' Dec 1984, Vol. 29 Issue 3, pp 297-335&lt;/ref&gt;

The then president, Ronald Reagan, in 1984, on the grounds of supposedly pro-Soviet trends, left the [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://deutsch.rt.com/international/58869-medienberichte-usa-planen-austritt-aus-unesco  Erklärung des US-Außenministeriums: USA verlassen die Unesco]/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.n-tv.de/politik/USA-treten-aus-Unesco-aus-article20080433.html Streit um Palästina: USA treten aus Unesco aus]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/unesco-austritt-amerikas-abkehr-a-1172682.html Amerikas Abkehr]&lt;/ref&gt;

With the end of the Cold War in 1989, and the demise of the Soviet Union in 1991, funding and support  systems collapsed and many front organizations shut down or were exposed. For example, post-Communist Moscow newspapers reported the World Peace Council, based in Helsinki, Finland, had received policy guidance and 90% of its funding from Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;Jan S. Adams, ''A Foreign Policy in Transition: Moscow's Retreat from Central America and the Caribbean, 1985-1992'' (Duke University Press, 1992) pp 69-70&lt;/ref&gt;

The Berlin Conference of European Catholics, originally the Berlin Conference of [[Catholic Church in Europe|Catholic Christians]] from European countries, was a conference held on the 17 and 18 November 1964 in East Berlin and organized with the support of the GDR government and the cooperation of the GDR state security. The historian Clemens Vollnhal arranges them as a Communist front organization.&lt;ref&gt;[[Clemens Vollnhals]], 1996: ''Die Kirchenpolitik von SED und Staatssicherheit: eine Zwischenbilanz'', Band 7 von Analysen und Dokumente, Ch. Links Verlag, {{ISBN|3-86153-122-4}}, S. 115 ({{Google books|7i5Ac0Taty4C||page=115}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the [[Christian Peace Conference]] were churches from the socialist countries as well as church communities and individuals from other countries. In the face of their initiation with the help of socialist states, which Christians were difficult to discriminate against and partly pursue, and the proximity to Marxism, the Christian Peace Conference is regarded as controversial.&lt;ref&gt;vgl. etwa Hedwig Richter: Der Protestantismus und das linksrevolutionäre Pathos.

During the [[Cold War]], [[Mondpaca Esperantista Movado]] (MEM) was able to conduct official activities on behalf of Esperanto in [[East Bloc]] countries on the condition that it must support their Communist governments and the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Glover Forster, ''The Esperanto movement'', Mouton Publishers, [[The Hague]], 1982, p. 399.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Federation of Teachers Unions]] (FISE), the [[Organization of Solidarity with the People of Asia, Africa and Latin America]] (OSPAAAL) and the [[International Radio and Television Organisation]] (OIRT) were also front organisations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.de/books?id=K5OwCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA107&amp;lpg=PA107&amp;dq=International+Radio+and+Television+Organisation+communist+front&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pikWar-pri&amp;sig=0LItsquZerVfAKkjRKsFI7NPPIM&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjNm_jXvIzZAhVBY1AKHbNMDsMQ6AEIWjAM#v=onepage&amp;q=International%20Radio%20and%20Television%20Organisation%20communist%20front&amp;f=false The North Atlantic Alliance and the Soviet Union in the 1980s]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/int/comintern-front.htm Communist Front Organizations]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asia==
The [[Pan-Pacific Trade Union Secretariat]] (PPTUS) was set up in 1927 by the Profintern (the Comintern's trade union arm) with the mission of promoting Communist trade unions in China, Japan, Korea, the Philippines, Australia, New Zealand and other nations in the western Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey Klehr, John Earl Haynes, and Fridrikh Igorevich Firsov, ''The Secret World of American Communism'' (1996) p 42&lt;/ref&gt;  Trapeznik (2009) says the PPTUS was a "Communist-front organization" and "engaged in overt and covert political agitation in addition to a number of clandestine activities." &lt;ref&gt;Alexander Trapeznik, "'Agents of Moscow' at the Dawn of the Cold War: The Comintern and the Communist Party of New Zealand," ''Journal of Cold War Studies'' Volume 11, Number 1, Winter 2009 pp. 124-49 quote on p 144&lt;/ref&gt;

There were numerous Communist front organizations in [[Asia]], many oriented to students and youth.&lt;ref&gt;For listings of front organizations in East Asia see Malcolm Kennedy, ''History of Communism in East Asia'' (Praeger Publishers, 1957) pp 118, 127-8, 130, 277, 334, 355, 361-7, 374, 415, 421, 424, 429, 439, 444, 457-8, 470, 482&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Japan]] in the labor union movement of the 1920s, according to one historian, "The [[Hyogikai]] never called itself a communist front but in effect, this was what it was." He points out it was repressed by the government "along with other communist front groups."&lt;ref&gt;Stephen S. Large, ''Organized Workers and Socialist Politics in Interwar Japan'' (2010) p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, Scalapino argues, "The primary Communist-front organization was the [[Japan Peace Committee]]." It was founded in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Scalapino, ''The Japanese Communist Movement 1920-1967'' (1967) p 117&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Consentrasi Gerakan Mahasiswa Indonesia]] ('Unified Movement of Students of Indonesia', abbreviated '''CGMI''') was an organization of university students in [[Indonesia]], linked to the [[Communist Party of Indonesia]]. CGMI was founded in 1956, through the merger of communist-led university student groups in [[Bogor]], [[Bandung]] and [[Yogyakarta]] (which had emerged in the early 1950s). At the time of its founding, CGMI had a membership of around 1,180.&lt;ref name="p1"&gt;Hindley, Donald. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ivY5wrVDluUC&amp;pg=PA196 The Communist Party of Indonesia, 1951-1963]''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1964. pp. 196-197&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fadjar Harapan]] ('Dawn of Hope') was a short-lived [[Indonesia]]n [[pioneer Movement|pioneer organization]], linked to the [[Communist Party of Indonesia]] (PKI). ''Fadjar Harapan'' was founded in 1959, albeit that there already was an existing [[Scouting movement]] initiated by the Communist Party.&lt;ref name="p1"/&gt; However, the organization was officially not connected to any political party (according to the constitution of the organization) and was open to all children between the ages of six and thirteen. The initiative to found the new organization was taken by the party leader [[Aidit]]. Cadres of the Communist Party and [[People's Youth (Indonesia)|Pemuda Rakjat]] (the youth wing of the Communist Party) were given the task to study how pioneer movements functioned in other countries, but adapting ''Fadjar Harapan'' to Indonesian conditions.&lt;ref name="p199"&gt;Hindley, Donald. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ivY5wrVDluUC&amp;pg=PA199 The Communist Party of Indonesia, 1951-1963]''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1964. p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gerwani]]’s affiliation with the [[Communist Party of Indonesia]] (PKI) eventually led to their demise after the events of [[30 September Movement|'''Gerakan 30 September, G30S''']] and the “attempted” coup. The arrest and imprisonment of Gerwani members was justified by the fabricated involvement of Gerwani in the killings of the six Generals during G30S. The [[Lubang Buaya]] myth, as described as discussed by historians, claimed that Gerwani had performed sadistic, sexual crimes before and after killing the six Generals during G30S. More seriously, Lubang Buaya was used to justify the mass killings of communists in the period immediately after the G30S – an incident that also led to the demise of Gerwani.

[[Peasants Front of Indonesia]] ({{lang-id|Barisan Tani Indonesia}}) was a peasant mass organization connected to the [[Communist Party of Indonesia]] (PKI). BTI was founded November 25, 1945. The previous peasant organization of PKI had been the [[Peasants Union (Indonesia)|Peasants Union]] (''Serikat Tani'') formed in 1945.

[[Bharatiya Khet Mazdoor Union]] literally  'Indian Land Workers Union' is a [[trade union]] of agricultural labourers in [[India]]. BKMU is politically tied to the [[Communist Party of India]] (CPI). BKMU is independent from both the main trade union central of CPI, the [[All India Trade Union Congress]], as well as the farmers' organisation of CPI, the [[All India Kisan Sabha (Ajoy Bhavan)|All India Kisan Sabha]].

[[National Federation of Indian Women]] is a women's organisation. It was established in 1954 by several leaders from [[Mahila Atma Raksha Samiti]] including [[Aruna Asaf Ali]].&lt;ref&gt;Menon, Parvathi.

The [[Anti-Imperialist National Democratic Front]] is an underground [[South Korea]]n organization that is called a [[Socialism|socialist]] political party by [[North Korea]] and a pro-[[Workers' Party of Korea|WPK]] spy group by South Korea. It is the only ostensibly South Korean organization to have a mission in [[Pyongyang]].&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Recalibrating the U.S.-Republic of Korea alliance|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=9781428910706|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=p2qTpBgYE48C|page=122|accessdate=2015-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party is banned in South Korea, under the [[National Security Act (South Korea)|National Security Law]], but operates [[clandestinely]]. It is similar in organization to the [[Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland]], the ''[[de jure]]'' [[popular front]] of North Korea. It has a mission in [[Pyongyang]], [[North Korea]] and another in [[Japan]].

The South Korean government petitioned the [[Constitutional Court of Korea]] to dissolve the UPP due to their alleged pro-North Korea views in November 2013, two months after the [[Unified Progressive Party]] members allegedly involved in the [[2013 South Korean sabotage plot]] were arrested. On 19 December 2014 the [[Constitutional Court of Korea]] ruled 8-1 in favour of the dissolution. The five UPP lawmakers were also deprived of their National Assembly seats.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/12/18/world/asia/ap-as-skorea-leftist-party.html?_r=0 S Korea Court Orders Dissolution of Leftist Party]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccourt.go.kr/home/storybook/storybook.jsp?eventnum=39101&amp;eventNo=2013%C7%E5%B4%D91&amp;accident_name=&amp;law_name=&amp;provision=&amp;accident1=2013&amp;accident2=%C7%E5%B4%D9&amp;accident3=1&amp;regname=&amp;flag=1&amp;list_type=05&amp;EmailPostReq=&amp;mainseq=148&amp;seq=1 Official court opinion (in Korean)]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Amnesty International]], the UPP's ban raised "serious questions as to the authorities' commitment to freedom of expression and association".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.dw.de/south-korea-court-orders-party-with-pro-north-korea-views-be-disbanded/a-18140824 |title=South Korea court orders party with 'pro-North Korea' views be disbanded |publisher=DW |date=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=South Korea court orders breakup of ‘pro-North’ leftwing party |newspaper=The Guardian |date=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Steven Borowiec |title=In unprecedented move, South Korea bans 'pro-North' political party |url=http://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-south-korea-bans-political-party-20141219-story.html |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Latin America==
Poppino argued that the effectiveness of Communist propaganda in [[Latin America]] "depends largely on the existence of a wide range of interlocking front groups that supplement and draw upon the Communist-led mass organizations."&lt;ref&gt;Rollie E. Poppino, ''International communism in Latin America: a history of the movement, 1917-1963'' (Free Press, 1966) p 133&lt;/ref&gt;

When nations turned toward the Soviet Union, they typically joined in numerous international front organizations, as [[Nicaragua]] did under the Sandinistas (Socialists) in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;Jan S.

[[Mao Zedong]] broke bitterly with the Soviet Union in the late 1950s, accusing [[Nikita Khrushchev]] especially of revisionism and betrayal of true Marxist-Leninist dogma.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Friedman,  "Soviet policy in the developing world and the Chinese challenge in the 1960s." ''Cold War History'' (2010) 10#2 pp: 247-272.&lt;/ref&gt; Mao set up a network of pro-Chinese, anti-Soviet parties and Communist fronts that directly challenged the pro-Soviet organizations in parts of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael D.

Despite deep ideological differences, the radical Islamists and the members of the PDPA both rejected [[Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan]] (RAWA) as a Maoist organization.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/revolutionary-association-women-afghanistan-rawa Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan (RAWA)]&lt;/ref&gt; One reason was that its founder [[Meena Keshwar Kamal]] married the [[Afghanistan Liberation Organization]] (ALO) leader [[Faiz Ahmad]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.de/books?id=mJam2RI3nVUC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;lpg=PA56&amp;dq=Revolutionary+Association+of+the+Women+of+Afghanistan+(RAWA)+as+a+Maoist+organization&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=50p4fQSu7G&amp;sig=TndtXLbJctN49pppSm1AGPQLz2k&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjAw_HB3fjYAhXEDewKHcIrDnMQ6AEIczAN#v=onepage&amp;q=Revolutionary%20Association%20of%20the%20Women%20of%20Afghanistan%20(RAWA)%20as%20a%20Maoist%20organization&amp;f=false With All Our Strength: The Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pracheachon]] was a legal front organisation for the [[Communist Party of Kampuchea]].

==Germany==
West Germany (and West Berlin) were centers of East-West conflict during the Cold War, and numerous Communist fronts were established. For example, the [[Society for German–Soviet Friendship]] (GfDSF) had 13,000 members in West Germany, but it was banned in 1953 by some Länder as a Communist front.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Major, ''The Death of the KPD: Communism and Anti-Communism in West Germany, 1945-1956'' (Oxford University Press, 1997) p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Cultural Association of the GDR|Democratic Cultural League of Germany]] started off as a series of genuinely pluralistic bodies, but in 1950–51 came under the control of Communists. By 1952 the U.S. Embassy counted 54 'infiltrated organizations', which started independently, as well as 155 'front organizations', which had been Communist inspired from their start.&lt;ref&gt;Major, ''The Death of the KPD: Communism and Anti-Communism in West Germany, 1945-1956'' pp 217–18&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Union of Persecutees of the Nazi Regime|Association of the Victims of the Nazi Regime]] was set up to rally West Germans under the antifascist banner, but had to be dissolved when Moscow discovered it had been infiltrated by Zionist agents.&lt;ref&gt;Vojtech Mastny, ''The Cold War and Soviet Insecurity: The Stalin Years'' (Oxford U.P., 1998) p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; In West Germany, the organisation was seen as taking its lead from the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) in the 1950s, and after 1968 of being controlled from the top by German Communist Party (DKP) members. The delegates of the Dusseldorf party congress of the SPD held in September 1948 an incompatibility resolution for the simultaneous membership in SPD and VVN.&lt;ref name="Meyer 2010 169"&gt;Kristina Meyer: ''Verfolgung, Verdrängung, Vermittlung: Die SPD und ihre NS-Verfolgten.''

The SPD leadership in the West around the former concentration camp prisoner [[Kurt Schumacher]], a dedicated anti-communist, had already rejected the founding of the VVN and in May 1948 with an anti-communist press campaign of the SPD board member [[Fritz Heine]] declaring the numerous non-Communist VVN officials "useful idiots" of the KPD and the "VVN-Nachrichten" edited by [[Peter Lütsches]] (CDU) into a communist press organ.&lt;ref name="Spernol_254"&gt;Bernd Spernol: ''Die „Kommunistenklausel“.

The [[Deutsche Friedens-Union]] (DFU) the [[German Communist Party]] (DKP) was close and was also financed&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Christoph Stamm: ''Bestand B 422 Die Deutsche Friedens-Union'', S. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heike Amos: ''Die SED-Deutschlandpolitik 1961 bis 1989: Ziele, Aktivitäten und Konflikte'', Vandenhoeck &amp; Rupprecht, Göttingen 2015, S. 228. Amos zitiert nach den ''Verhandlungen des Deutschen Bundestags'', Band 502 (1994, 12. Wahlperiode), Dokument 537, S. 2167–2171.&lt;/ref&gt; by the SED, which was however denied.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The [[Bund der Deutschen]] (BdD) was founded in 1953. Wirth and Elfes led the party, but there was also a strong influence of communist forces.&lt;ref&gt;Dirk Mellies: ''Trojanische Pferde der DDR? Das neutralistisch-pazifistische Netzwerk der frühen Bundesrepublik und die Deutsche Volkszeitung, 1953–1973.'' Lang, Frankfurt am Main u. a. 2006, {{ISBN|3-631-55825-2}} (Europäische Hochschulschriften. Reihe 3: Geschichte und ihre Hilfswissenschaften, 1039), S. 41ff. Vgl. auch Udo Baron: Kalter Krieg und heißer Frieden. Der Einfluss der SED und ihrer westdeutschen Verbündeten auf die Partei ‚Die Grünen‘. Lit, Münster 2003, S. 37f.&lt;/ref&gt; The SED saw in the BdD a chance, similar to the concept of the National Front in the GDR, bourgeois and "national-minded" forces as a coalition partner to win. The core program of the BdD was a neutrality policy, which turned against the rearmament and the Westintegration of Germany. In contrast to the Federal Government, an agreement was reached with the Soviet Union. With the founding of the German Peace Union in 1961, in which numerous BdD politicians were involved, the BdD no longer existed as an independent political force, but was essentially limited to the publication of the German Volkszeitung. He also ran no longer in elections but sent candidates to the list of the DFU. Double memberships in BdD and DFU were expressly permitted.&lt;ref&gt;Rolf Schönfeldt: Die Deutsche Friedens-Union. In: Richard Stöss (Hrsg.): ''Parteien Handbuch. Die Parteien der Bundesrepublik Deutschland 1945–1980. Band 1: AUD–EFP.'' Westdeutscher Verlag, Opladen 1983, {{ISBN|3-531-11570-7}}, S. 848–876 (Schriften des Zentralinstituts für sozialwissenschaftliche Forschung der Freien Universität Berlin, 38). Vgl. auch Dirk Mellies: ''Trojanische Pferde der DDR? Das neutralistisch-pazifistische Netzwerk der frühen Bundesrepublik und die Deutsche Volkszeitung, 1953–1973.'' Lang, Frankfurt am Main u. a. 2006, {{ISBN|3-631-55825-2}} (Europäische Hochschulschriften. Reihe 3: Geschichte und ihre Hilfswissenschaften, 1039). &lt;/ref&gt; The constitutional protection of North Rhine-Westphalia, which observes the BdD, classified the BdD as a front-run cadre organization of the DFU in 1964. On 2 November 1968, the DKP, DFU, BdD and other left-wing groups decided to join the Joint Action Action for Democratic Progress (ADF) on the [[West German federal election, 1969]]. The membership stock, which Helmut Bausch had estimated to be around 12,000 for the years 1953 to 1955, according to a note to the Ulbricht office in 1965, have amounted to only 2,000 to 3,000.

In the peak of the [[Cold War]] in 1960, the chairman of the German wing of the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]] (WILPF) referred to the ''Internationale Frauenliga für Frieden und Freiheit'' (IFFF) (and hundreds of other members of the IFFF), headed by the CDU politician [[Rainer Barzel]] together with [[Franz Josef Strauss]] (CSU) and headed by Barzel, as "communist-controlled". On the other hand, the IFFF successfully filed a complaint and Barzel had to withdraw his allegation. However, numerous women left the organization, only local groups remained in West Berlin, Hamburg, Bremen, Munich and Duisburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wilpf.de/die-liga/geschichte/]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Republikanische Club (RC) was put up, among others, by Hubertus Knabe in his book "Die Unterhanderte Republik", that the RC as a whole was influenced by the GDR or even controlled. Actually, however, the relationship between the RC and the GDR was rather disincentive, in particular one refused an approach to the [[Socialist Unity Party of West Berlin|SEW]], the West Berlin offshoot of the SED. They and the GDR were seen as an obstacle to the new beginning of a left movement. Recent research on files from the BStU as well as from the estates of prominent members confirms that state security was active in West Berlin and also in the RC. It did not, however, aim at countervailing assumptions, but on a moderation of the extra-parliamentary opposition in order to be able to control them in the form of a party formation under the influence of SEW. This strategy failed, however, and the attempts to influence remained unaffected.

The Social Democratic Action (SDA), later Socialist Action, had been an opposition party in the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD), controlled by the SED since 1948. The work of the SDA started first in the SPD, which was authorized by the Occupying Council to build the walls throughout the city. The SDA was active both in the east and in the west of the city. In [[East Berlin]], she temporarily appointed magistrates, mayors and other functionaries, and was even represented in the [[Volkskammer]] until 1954 with deputies. Since 1950, the organization also tried to gain a foothold in the Federal Republic of Germany, but remained a splinter group. Membership in it was declared incompatible with employment in the public service in 1950 by the Federal Government. In 1956, it was banned in the course of the [[KPD]] ban in the Federal Republic. After the erection of Berlin Wall in 1961 it also dissolved itself in the [[GDR]].

In East Germany front operations were not directly controlled by Moscow.  They were instead operated by The [[German Communist Party]] (DKP), which was in power after 1945. It took political and financial&lt;ref&gt;Deutscher Bundestag, Drucksache, 12/7600, Bonn, S. 505 f. [http://dipbt.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/12/076/1207600.pdf (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt; support from the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|SED]] and worked closely with the [[Socialist Unity Party of West Berlin]] (SEW), which was controllede&lt;ref&gt;[[Hannes Schwenger]]: [http://www.tagesspiegel.de/kultur/literatur-alt/die-willigen-helfer-in-west-berlin/1610366.html ''Die willigen Helfer in West-Berlin.''] tagesspiegel.de, 5. Oktober 2009; abgerufen am 27. Oktober 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and financed by the SED.

On suspicion of being close to the DKP, members of the [[German Peace Society]] were temporarily observed in the Federal Republic of Germany by the [[Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution]]. Some of them were denied access to public service professions as a result of the radical decree of the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

From 10 November 1959 to 8 April 1960 were the pastor Johannes Oberhof, the former KPD official and former pastor Erwin Eckert, the interpreter Walter Diehl, the publisher Gerhard Wohlrath, the worker Gustav Tiefes, the insurance clerk Erich Kompalla and the former SPD Councilor Edith Hoereth-Menge accused by the Attorney General of their role in the [[Peace Committee of the Federal Republic of Germany]] the ringleadership in an anti-constitutional organization. This was justified in particular by the fact that some of the defendants had belonged to the now banned KPD. Their activities are therefore camouflage for the assumed by the Attorney General real goal of "establishing a communist regime in the Federal Republic".

==Austria==
The Democratic Union was accused by the [[Austrian People's Party|ÖVP]] and [[Federation of Independents|VdU]] financed by the Soviet Union, while some [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|SPÖ]] parliamentarians the DU referred to as "[[Heimwehr]] fascists".&lt;ref name="Mueller"&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Wolfgang Mueller|Title=Die sowjetische Besatzung in Österreich 1945–1955 und ihre politische Mission|Publisher=Böhlau|PublicationPlace=Wien|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;222–232|ISBN=978-3-205-77399-3|Date=2005|language=German|URL={{Google books|Niy6TSdkT-QC||page=222}}

At the [[Austrian legislative election, 1953]], the DU entered into an electoral coalition called the "People's Opposition" with the [[Communist Party of Austria|KPÖ]] and the Socialist Workers' Party (SAP). In fact, this alliance was supported by the Soviet occupying forces, hoping to establish a national [[United front]], with which Austria could be transformed into a [[socialist state]]. In this fantasy, the DU should replace the ÖVP in the medium term and the SAP the SPÖ. The KPÖ was also informed about these plans. In the occupation organs ''Österreichische Zeitung'' and ''Welt-Illustrierte'' a press campaign was operated for the people's opposition.&lt;ref name="Mueller" /&gt; Finally, the Alliance could gain in the election 5.28 percent of the vote and thus four mandates, a - measured by the support - for the Soviet Union disappointing result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nationalratswahl vom 22. Februar 1953|periodical=|publisher=[[Bundesministerium für Inneres]]|url=http://www.bmi.gv.at/412/Nationalratswahlen/Nationalratswahl_1953/start.aspx|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2017-11-03|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the four mandates none went to Dobretsberger and the party lost more and more importance.

== Greece ==
The [[United Democratic Left]] was founded the July 1951 by prominent center-left and leftist politicians, some of which were former members of [[Greek People's Liberation Army|ELAS]]. While initially ''EDA'' was meant to act as a substitute and political front of the banned [[Communist Party of Greece]], it eventually acquired a voice of its own, rather pluralistic and moderate. This development was more clearly shown at the time of the 1968 split in the ranks of Communist Party of Greece, with almost all former members of ''EDA'' joining the faction with [[Euro-communist]], moderate tendencies.

== Turkey ==
The [[Peoples' Democratic Party (Turkey)|Peoples' Democratic Party]] (HDP) maintained talks with [[Abdullah Öcalan]], from this talks Öcalan give a message to the congress stating that "We have never considered our movement apart from Turkey's revolutionary and socialist movements. We have always regarded ourselves as an integral part of this outcome" and "we have to consider the HDP as an integral part of the historical democratic dialogue and negotiation process. If socialism and an open democracy succeed in Turkey, it will be closely related to this democratic negotiation process.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/gundem/26663515.asp|title=HDP’den PKK şov|trans-title=|author=Okan KONURALP / ANKARA|work=HÜRRİYET - TÜRKİYE'NİN AÇILIŞ SAYFASI|access-date=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Öcalan's niece Dilek Öcalan and Öcalan's nephew Öcalan Urfa'dan were among the HDP parliamentary candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/turkce/haberler/2015/04/150407_hdp_adaylar|title=HDP listesinde kadın adaylar ve azınlıklar öne çıkıyor|trans-title=|work=BBC Türkçe|access-date=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between the HDP and the PKK has been put forward by the governing [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] (AKP) as a reason why it would be better for the HDP to not gain representation in Parliament, though government journalists alleged that this would result in greater violence by the PKK and attempts to establish a separate parliament in [[Diyarbakır]].&lt;ref name="todayszaman.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/national_ak-party-officials-insinuate-hdp-pkk-link-hdp-outraged_378918.html|title=AKP officials insinuate HDP-PKK link, HDP outraged|date=24 April 2015|work=TodaysZaman|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internethaber.com/pkkdan-hdp-icin-bomba-secim-kehaneti-761569h.htm|title=PKK'dan HDP için bomba seçim kehaneti|work=Internethaber|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In election posters and propaganda, the HDP has been accused of scaremongering and using the PKK to coerce voters into voting for them, stating that there would be more violence if the HDP failed to pass the election threshold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ulusalkanal.com.tr/gundem/pkk-dan-baraj-tehdidi-hdp-barajin-altinda-kalirsa-h58928.html|title=PKK'dan baraj tehdidi: HDP barajın altında kalırsa...|author=Ulusal Kanal|date=3 May 2015|work=Ulusal Kanal|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, HDP politicians also accused the AKP of scaremongering when they claimed that their affiliation to the PKK made them unfit for parliamentary representation.&lt;ref name="todayszaman.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aksam.com.tr/yazarlar/kurtulus-tayiz/pkkhdpnin-korku-siyaseti/haber-402926|title=PKK/HDP'nin korku siyaseti|date=4 May 2015|publisher=|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; PKK militants have also been accused of raiding local shops and cafes in the south-east of Turkey and demanding votes for the HDP, with one civilian being wounded when a group of PKK youth militants raided a cafe in [[Silvan, Diyarbakır|Silvan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sozcu.com.tr/2015/gunun-icinden/pkk-kahvehane-basip-oy-istedi-816292/|title=PKK kahvehane basıp oy istedi!|date=28 April 2015|publisher=|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.takvim.com.tr/guncel/2015/05/04/pkkdan-hdpye-oy-verin-baskisi|title=PKK'dan 'HDP'ye oy verin' baskısı|work=takvim.com.tr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selahattin Demirtaş has denied having an 'organic relationship' with the PKK and claimed that the allegations of PKK militants demanding votes for the HDP from voters was untrue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haberturk.com/gundem/haber/1069160-selahattin-demirtas-haberturke-acikladi-pkk-ile-organik-bagimiz-yok|title=Selahattin Demirtaş Habertürk'e açıkladı: PKK ile organik bağımız yok|date=22 April 2015|work=www.haberturk.com|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/turkce/haberler/2015/04/150417_agri_alan_mucadelesi|title=Ağrı'da AKP-HDP 'alan mücadelesi' mi yaşanıyor?|work=BBC Türkçe|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
The [[Association of United Ukrainian Canadians]] (AUUC) is a national cultural-educational non-profit organization established for [[Ukrainian Canadian|Ukrainians in Canada]].  With branches throughout Canada it sponsors such cultural activities as [[Ukrainian dance|dance groups]], orchestras, choirs and children's activities within the Association. The organization was procommunist.

The [[Canadian Labour Defence League]] was a legal defence organization founded and led by Reverend [[A.E. Smith]]. The league was in 1925 as a [[civil rights]] organization dedicated to protecting striking workers from persecution. It was allied with the [[Communist Party of Canada]] and functioned as a front for the party. The group was the Canadian affiliate of [[International Red Aid]].

The [[Dominion Communist–Labor Total War Committee]] was a front organization of the then-banned [[Communist Party of Canada]].

The [[Federation of Russian Canadians]] is a left-leaning cultural organization for [[Russians|Russian]] immigrants to Canada and their descendants.
It is the successor of the Russian Farmer-Worker Clubs which were closed by the government at the beginning of [[World War II]] as a suspected [[subversive]] organization due to its links with the [[Communist Party of Canada]]. In 1942, after the [[Operation Barbarossa|Nazi invasion of the USSR]], the organization reappeared as the Federation of Russian Canadians, known also by its Russian initials as the FRK.&lt;ref name=ce&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1SEC907478 Russians], ''Canadian Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Finnish Organization of Canada]] (FOC, {{lang-fi|Kanadan Suomalainen Järjestö}}) is a [[Finnish Canadian]] cultural organization. It was established in 1911 as the '''Finnish Socialist Organization of Canada''' (''Kanadan Suomalainen Sosialistinen Järjestö''). FOC is the oldest nationwide cultural organization for Finns in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/finns/ Finns] Historica Canada. Retrieved 10 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; It was first connected with [[Social Democratic Party of Canada]] and later with [[Communist Party of Canada]]. Today FOC is no longer associated with politics. It has fewer than 200 members, who are mostly senior citizens in the areas of [[Toronto]], [[Vancouver]], [[Sudbury, Ontario|Sudbury]] and [[Thunder Bay, Ontario|Thunder Bay]].&lt;ref name=magocsi&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dbUuX0mnvQMC&amp;pg=PA521 Paul R.

The [[Relief Camp Workers' Union]] (RCWU) was the union into which the inmates of the Canadian government relief camps were organized in the early 1930s. It was affiliated with the [[Workers' Unity League]], the trade union umbrella of the [[Communist Party of Canada]]. The organization is best known for organizing the [[On-to-Ottawa Trek]] during the [[Great Depression]].

The [[United Jewish People's Order]] is a secular socialist Jewish cultural, political and educational fraternal organization in [[Canada]]. The UJPO traces its history to 1926 and the founding of the Labour League. It was for many years associated with the [[Labor-Progressive Party]], as the [[Communist Party of Canada]] was known.

Davidson argues that in Australia with the onset of the [[Great Depression]], "Support for Communist front organizations increased."&lt;ref&gt;Alastair Davidson, ''The Communist Party of Australia: a short history'' (1969) p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the [[Movement Against War and Fascism]] and the Australian Writers' League.

British intelligence infiltrated several Communist fronts in Australia, looking for organized efforts to block Britain's Cold War policies.&lt;ref&gt;Richard C. S. Trahair, ''Encyclopedia of Cold War Espionage, Spies and Secret Operations.'' (Greenwood Press, 2004) p 22&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
{{Main|List of organizations described as Communist fronts by the US government}}
The [[Hollywood Anti-Nazi League]] was a communist front organization, run by the American popular front, it attracted broad support in Hollywood from both members and nonmembers of the [[Communist Party USA]] (CPUSA). Like many such communist front groups, it ceased all anti-Nazi activities immediately upon the signing of the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] in August 1939.

Contemporary Historians Inc. was a 1937 active American film company, who financed a single film, The Spanish Earth by Joris Ivens, during their existence.
Joris Ivens came from the [[Netherlands]], alongside the "Contemporary Historians", the [[United States]] [[John Dos Passos]], [[Archibald MacLeish]], [[Clifford Odets]], [[Lillian Hellman]], [[Herman Shumlin]] and [[Ernest Hemingway]], the latter largely independently, while all remaining in contact with the Communist Party USA or one of their communist front organizations. In 1931, during his time with [[Mezhrabpomfilm]] [[Otto Katz]], Ivens had become acquainted with the [[Machtergreifung]] in [[Hollywood]] through his lectures [[Anti-fascist]] and the [[Comintern]] took a footing there.

A report of the Special Committee on Un-American Activities of the [[United States House of Representatives]] published a four-pronged definition of a "Communist front" in March 1944. Frequently repeated in official government documents, this definition asserted that Communist fronts shared (1) a common origin; (2) organization upon a "Communist pattern"; (3) interlocking personnel; and (4) methods intended to deceive the public.&lt;ref&gt;This definition is probably the work of Dies Committee investigator [[J. B. Matthews]]. See: Committee on Un-American Activities, US House of Representatives, ''Guide to Subversive Organizations and Publications (and Appendices): Revised and Published December 1, 1961 to supersede Guide published on January 2, 1957: (Including Index).'' Washington, DC: US Government Printing Office, 1961; pg. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian  Bernard K. Johnpoll states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Thousands of Americans joined Communist fronts during the 1930s. Few of them realized the true nature of the organizations they joined. The fronts paraded as independent, nonpartisan groups under the facade of non-Communist control. They were actually satellites of the Communist Party whose primary aim was to create the impression of mass support for an essential part of the party line. To maintain the illusion of non- Communist control, the formal leadership of these organizations was almost invariably composed of non-party members; the actual control was, however, in the hands of party activists.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard K. Johnpoll, ed., ''A Documentary History of the Communist Party of the United States - Vol. 3'' (1994) p 191 [https://www.questia.com/library/99389136/a-documentary-history-of-the-communist-party-of-the online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the late 1940s, at the start of the [[Cold War]], the [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]] (HUAC) and the [[Senate Internal Security Subcommittee]] (SISS) investigated and listed a number of suspected organizations.  In 1955, SSIS published a list of what it described as the 82 most active and typical sponsors of Communist fronts in the United States; some of those named had literally dozens of affiliations with groups that had either been cited as Communist fronts or had been labelled "[[subversion (political)|subversive]]" by either the Subcommittee or the House Committee on Un-American Activities.&lt;ref&gt;Page 90-100 "COMMUNIST FRONT ORGANIZATIONS",[https://archive.org/details/communistpartyof1955unit The communist party of the United States of America, what it is, how it works; a handbook for Americans (1955)] SUBCOMMITTEE TO INVESTIGATE THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE INTERNAL SECURITY ACT AND OTHER INTERNAL SECURITY LAWS OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, UNITED STATES SENATE, DECEMBER 21, 1955, 1955 UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE WASHINGTON : 1955&lt;/ref&gt;

Schrecker says that [[anti-Communist]] leaders believed that the Party used front groups to attract "fellow travelers," who were "unsuspecting liberals and well-meaning dupes drawn into the Communist orbit without realizing that the Party was using them for its own purposes." Schrecker says that on the contrary, "most of these people knowingly collaborated with the party, believing it to be the most effective ally they could find."&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Schrecker, ''The age of McCarthyism: a brief history with documents'' (2002) p 8&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theodore Draper]] asks, "To what extent was it possible, at least in the nineteen-twenties, to belong to a Communist front without being a Communist sympathizer?" His answer is that, "Only the most naive could have belonged to a front for any considerable length of time without realizing its political coloration.  The top leaders of the early fronts were not merely Communists; they were top-ranking Communists."&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Draper, ''American Communism and Soviet Russia'' (2003) p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attorney General list of alleged Communist fronts, 1948===
Starting in 1939, Attorney General Biddle began compiling a list of Fascist and Communist front organizations. It was called "[[Attorney General's List of Subversive Organizations]]" (AGLOSO), but was not at first made public.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Justin Goldstein, "Prelude to McCarthyism," ''Prologue,'' Fall 2006, Vol. 38 Issue 3, pp 22-33&lt;/ref&gt;  Political pressures from Congress forced President [[Harry S. Truman]] to act.&lt;ref&gt;Francis H. Thompson, ''The Frustration of Politics: Truman, Congress, and the Loyalty Issue, 1945-1953'' (1979)&lt;/ref&gt; Truman's Attorney General [[Tom C. Clark]] expanded the list, which was officially authorized by presidential [[Executive Order 9835]] in 1947 and was administered by the new Loyalty Review Board. The Board became part of the Civil Service Commission.&lt;ref&gt;Henry L. Shattuck, "The Loyalty Review Board Of The U.S. Civil Service Commission, 1947-1953," ''Massachusetts Historical Society Proceedings, 1966, Vol. 78, pp 63-80&lt;/ref&gt; The list was used by federal agencies to screen appointments during the Truman Administration.  The program investigated over 3 million government employees, of whom 300 were dismissed as security risks. Adverse decisions could be appealed to the Loyalty Review Board, a government agency set up by President Truman.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Donovan, ''Conflict and crisis: the presidency of Harry S. Truman, 1945-1948'' (1996) p 295&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tim McNeese, ''The Cold War and Postwar America 1946-1963'' (2010) p 63&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 20, 1948 the Loyalty Review Board published the previously secret Attorney General's "List of Communist classified organizations" in ''The Federal Register.'' This list included the name and date founded, as well as headquarters address and names of chief officers for active groups.&lt;ref&gt;''Federal Register 13,'' 20 March 1948: Attorney General's List of Communist classified organizations.&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of organizations described as Communist fronts by the US government|The complete list]] included about 200 organizations.

Attorney General's consolidated list November 1, 1955, includes also wartime German, Japanese, and Italian influenced organizations as well as white nationalist groups:&lt;ref&gt;Pages 722 to 727 [https://archive.org/details/scopeofsovietact1316unit Scope of Soviet Activity in the United States] HEARINGS BEFORE THE SUBCOMMITTEE TO INVESTIGATE THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE INTERNAL SECURITY ACT AND OTHER INTERNAL SECURITY LAWS OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY UNITED STATES SENATE EIGHTY-FOURTH CONGRESS SECOND SESSION ON SCOPE OF SOVIET ACTIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES APRIL 10, 11, AND 12, 1956 PART 13, United States Government Printing Office, 1956&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alleged CPUSA front organizations, c. 1980===
Late in the [[Cold War]], [[Richard Felix Staar]] alleged that Soviet intelligence had [[Soviet-run peace movements in Western Europe and the United States|infiltrated many peace movements in the West]], most importantly, the [[World Peace Council]].&lt;ref name=Staar79-84&gt;Richard Felix Staar, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Hvv7U15xCtMC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Foreign policies of the Soviet Union]'', Hoover Press, 1991, {{ISBN|0-8179-9102-6}}, p.79, p.84&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to WPC, important communist front organizations included its affiliate the [[U.S. Peace Council]], the [[World Federation of Trade Unions]], the [[World Federation of Democratic Youth]], and the [[International Union of Students]].&lt;ref name=Staar84&gt;Richard Felix Staar, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Hvv7U15xCtMC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Foreign policies of the Soviet Union]'', Hoover Press, 1991, {{ISBN|0-8179-9102-6}}, p.84&lt;/ref&gt; Staar asserted that somewhat less important front organizations included: [[Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organisation]], [[Christian Peace Conference]], [[International Association of Democratic Lawyers]], [[International Federation of Resistance Movements]], [[International Institute for Peace]], [[International Organization of Journalists]], [[Women's International Democratic Federation]] and [[World Federation of Scientific Workers]].&lt;ref name=Staar80-81&gt;Richard Felix Staar, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Hvv7U15xCtMC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Foreign policies of the Soviet Union]'', Hoover Press, 1991, {{ISBN|0-8179-9102-6}}, p.80-81&lt;/ref&gt;   Numerous peace conferences, congresses and festivals have been staged with support of those organizations.&lt;ref name=Staar85&gt;Richard Felix Staar, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Hvv7U15xCtMC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Foreign policies of the Soviet Union]'', Hoover Press, 1991, {{ISBN|0-8179-9102-6}}, p.85&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4191">Founded in the mid-1980s, the '''Corsican Workers’ Trade Union''' (STC, Syndicat des Travailleurs Corses), an offshoot of the island's [[nationalist]] movement, quickly became the island's most popular organization for [[workers]] on the island. Besides agitating for the [[economic]] agenda one would expect of a [[labour union]] the STC has an agenda pushing for greater [[cultural]] [[Wiktionary:autonomy|autonomy]] from [[France]].

==Strikes against SNCM==
In late February 2004, the STC declared a campaign on the state owned [[maritime transport]] firm National Corsican Mediterranean Company (Société Nationale Corse Méditerranée, SNCM). STC demanded that the [[company (law)|company]], which provides a great deal of the sea borne transport to and from the island, hire more [[Corsica]]ns as well as raise their wages. An initial compromise was reached at the time, but a court struck it down on grounds of [[discrimination]]. 

STC renewed their effort September 3 of that year, much to the chagrin of the financially destitute company. The [[strike action|strike]] was brought to a close September 19 with SCNM agreeing to, "Rebalance the numbers of new crew members recruited in Corsica and in other regions, using equal competence criteria and within the normal parameters of the company’s recruitment" in addition to 'island resident' bonuses for Corsican employees. It is likely SCNM was motivated to compromise by competition from [[Corsica Ferries]], a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] company that, nevertheless, is headquartered in [[Bastia]] and has "A management structure {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} young Corsicans". Although employing only 290 islanders, as opposed to SCNM's 816, Corsica Ferries has a paybill of 50 million [[euro]]s and is a likely contributor to SCNM's 11% decline in profits from Corsican services between 1996 and 2003 (72% to 61%).

The agreement served to highlight the tensions between STC and the mainland General Confederation of Labour ([[Confédération générale du travail]], CGT).  SNCM ships were blockaded for four days as a protest against what mainland unions feel is a political agenda, namely [[Corsican nationalism]] that threatens French principles of non-discrimination. The [[French government]], however, ruled the compromise, "Does not infringe the principle of non-discrimination in employment" and the [[Corsican CGT]] branch joined local business and political leaders in what they saw as an important step against the disparity in Corsican employees in a business receiving substantial subsidies from the Corsican regional authority.

By 2005 SCNM was in even worse financial condition. When plans for a [[Butler Capital Partners]] of the firm were announced sometimes violent STC protests erupted in Bastia (there were protests in [[Marseille]] as well, but these were not affiliated with STC but the CGT). Commandos were brought in to recapture the [[Pasquale Paoli]], an SCNM ship hijacked in Marseille by 30 STC members, when it attempted to enter the Bastia port. An investigation into "hijacking a ship" was launched, if found guilty the ring leaders may be faced with 30 years in prison. More demonstrators attempted to seal the port and stop two ships from leaving. They clashed violently with [[riot police]] for four hours injuring a photographer before the ships were free to leave. 

Contrary to the earlier disagreement with SCNM, the STC and the CGT were united in their condemnation of the privatization plans; "The government bears the entire responsibility for the conflict... The workers are raising their heads and have decided to fight against the consequences of intensive liberalism" read the joint statement released by France's main trade unions who were joined by the [[French Socialist Party]] in their condemnation of the military response to the strikes.

{{Politics of Kosovo}}
The '''Democratic Party of Kosovo''' ([[Albanian Language|Albanian]]: ''Partia Demokratike e Kosovës'', ''PDK'') the third-largest [[List of political parties in Kosovo|political party]] in [[Kosovo]]. It was originally a [[social-democratic]] party coming out of [[Demilitarisation|demilitarized]] [[Kosovo Liberation Army|KLA]] after the [[Kosovo War|war]] with most of the leadership being Albanian nationalists and former members of [[People's Movement of Kosovo|PMK]], but during its congress in January 2013, it positioned itself as a center-right party.&lt;ref name="center-right1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="center-right2"/&gt; It is the main [[center-right]] party in Kosovo. The party shows strong [[socially conservative]] and [[economic liberalism|economically liberal]] tendencies.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

It is headed by [[Kadri Veseli]], a leader of the former [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] and [[Kosovo Intelligence Service|SHIK]]. The first post-[[Kosovo War|war]] [[Prime Minister of Kosovo]], [[Bajram Rexhepi]], belongs to the Democratic Party of Kosovo.

== History ==
The party was founded on May 14, 1999 from the political wing of the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] as the Party for the Democratic Progress of Kosovo (''Partia për Progres Demokratik e Kosovës''), but was renamed on May 21, 2000. The party has increased in size and regional scope, initially ''winning governing'' spot in the elections of 2007 and winning most of the regional elections in the municipal elections of 2009. PDK renewed its governing mandate after winning the elections of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ddh.nl/fy/kosova/reports/2000/bpt-k-monthly1906.html dDH's 'Hope'; Kosova Crisis 2000; BPT-Reports: Monthly report # 15&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; {{Wikisource|Executive Order 13219}}Members of the Party for the Democratic Progress of Kosovo were blacklisted{{by whom|date=December 2013}} in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Executive Order 13219]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://fedbbs.access.gpo.gov/library/fac_bro/balkans.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2004 [[legislative]] [[elections in Kosovo|elections]], the party won 28.9% of the popular vote and 30 out of 120 seats in the [[Assembly of Kosovo]]; in 2007 PDK won a majority for the first time with 35% of the vote. In 2010's disputed elections, PDK won again with 32% of the vote.

After 14 years of leadership of Hashim Thaçi who had to resign from party leadership to take the position of the President of the country, in May 2016, Parliament Speaker [[Kadri Veseli]] became party president by acclamation. He was elected with no votes against and no abstentions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Matoshi|first1=Albatrit|title=Kadri Velseli kryetar i ri i PDK-së|url=http://zeri.info/aktuale/89177/kadri-velseli-kryetar-i-ri-i-pdk-se/|accessdate=7 May 2016|work=Zëri|date=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elections in 2010==
[[Kosovan parliamentary election, 2010|Parliamentary elections]] were held on 12 December 2010, the first such elections organized by Kosovans since their declaration of independence. After early results, [[Hashim Thaçi]], who was on course to gain 32 per cent of the vote, claimed victory for PDK, the Democratic Party of Kosovo. He said he intended to continue governing for another 4 years. After accusations of vote-rigging, voting was repeated in several municipalities. With more than 30 per cent of the vote, Thaçi formed a coalition with the [[Alliance for New Kosovo|New Kosovo ALliance (AKR)]], led by the ex-president, [[Behgjet Pacolli]]. It was in fourth place with 8 percent of the vote.

The turnout at the election was significantly higher than usual, augmented by Serbs who decided to vote in the disputed republic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euractiv.com/en/enlargement/hashim-tha-claims-victory-kosovo-elections-news-500526 Agencies: "Ex-guerrilla chief claims victory in Kosovo election"], Euractiv.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the confirmation of the final election results, PDK and AKR formed a government with a program dedicated to [[European Union|EU]] integrations. The new government included many of the younger generation of PDK members, such as Bedri Hamza, [[Memli Krasniqi]], [[Vlora Citaku]], Blerand Stavileci, [[Petrit Selimi]], etc.

==Abuse of power (Pronto Clan)==
Key figures in the underground [[Kosovo Intelligence Service]] close to PDK  accused of executing political opponents in LDK, were current Speaker of Parliament, [[Kadri Veseli]], and MPs Elmi Reçica, Fadil Demaku and former MPs Fatmir Xhelili and Latif Gashi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kadri Veseli: Ja kush ishte pjesë e SHIK-ut|url=http://botasot.info/lajme/173547/kadri-veseli-ja-kush-ishte-pjese-e-shik-ut/4|website=[[Bota Sot]]|accessdate=7 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; MPs Rrustem Mustafa and Latif Gashi resigned their offices in 2015 after receiving confirmed sentenced for war crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Edhe Rrustem Mustafa dorëzon mandatin e deputetit|url=http://www.telegrafi.com/lajme/edhe-rrustem-mustafa-dorezon-mandatin-e-deputetit-2-76000.html|website=Telegrafi.com|accessdate=7 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2016, PDK MP Azem Syla was sought for arrest in connection to a large criminal group which appropriated socially owned property located in Prishtina’s suburbs amounting 30 million EUR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Police raids the home of former KLA leader and MP Azem Syla|url=http://prishtinainsight.com/police-raids-home-former-kla-leader-mp-azem-syla/|website=Prishtina Insight|publisher=BIRN Kosovo|accessdate=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sokol Bashota of Klina was being investigated for abuse of office in 2016.&lt;ref name="Koha mayors" /&gt;

In 2000 the brother of PDK leader Hashim Thaçi Gani Thaçi was found during a raid in Prishtina with a million German marks (500,000 euros) in cash. The origin of the money was uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mappes-Niediek|first1=Norbert|title=Wundersamer Waschsalon|url=http://www.zeit.de/2001/49/Wundersamer_Waschsalon|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=Die Ziet|issue=49/2001|date=29 November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Interior Minister Bajram Rexhepi was in office when about 1.5 million euros were embezzled is a case related to the production of passports by an Austrian company. Later about 200,000 of them were discovered in a chauffeur of Kadri Veseli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wölfl|first1=Adelheid|title=Neuer Anlauf für Kosovo-Pässe|url=http://derstandard.at/1356427710952/Neuer-Anlauf-fuer-Kosovo-Paesse|accessdate=7 February 2016|publisher=Der Standard|date=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adem Grabovci, leader of PDK parliamentary group, was involved in the "Pronto" scandal, a leak of audio recordings of an EULEX investigation, in which Adem Grabovci, Hashim Thaçi and Vlora Çitaku discuss employment of an uncle of Grabovci, Curr Gjoci. Shortly afterwards, Gjoci was appointed Director of the University Clinical Centre in Prishtina. In another scandal Grabovci's sons beat several police officers. They were sentenced to a prison sentence of six months which converted to 3,000 EUR fine each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dënohen djemtë e Adem Grabovcit|url=http://www.telegrafi.com/lajme/denohen-djemte-e-adem-grabovcit-80-9661.html|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=Telegrafi.com|date=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills''' ('''DIUS''') was a [[British government departments|UK government department]] created on 28 June 2007 to take over some of the functions of the [[Department for Education and Skills (United Kingdom)|Department of Education and Skills]] and of the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]]. Its head office was based at Kingsgate House, 66-74 Victoria Street, London SW1, which has now been demolished. In June 2009 it was merged into the newly formed [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page19525 Number10: Changes to the machinery of Government] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608051333/http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page19525 |date=2009-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was responsible for adult learning, some parts of further education, higher education, skills, science and innovation.

DIUS also had responsibility for a number of Non-Departmental Public Bodies (NDPBs). These included the Research Councils:

* [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] [http://www.mrc.ac.uk]
* [[Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council]] (BBSRC)[http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk]
* [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council]] (EPSRC) [http://www.epsrc.ac.uk]
* The [[Economic and Social Research Council]] (ESRC) [http://www.esrc.ac.uk]
* The [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]] (AHRC) [http://www.ahrc.ac.uk]
* The [[Science and Technology Facilities Council]] (STFC) [http://www.stfc.ac.uk]
* The [[Natural Environment Research Council]] (NERC) [http://www.nerc.ac.uk]

Other NDPBs sponsored by DIUS were:

* [[Higher Education Funding Council for England]] (HEFCE) [https://web.archive.org/web/20130327000620/http://www.hefce.ac.uk/]
* Student Loans Company (SLC) [http://www.slc.co.uk]
* The Technology Strategy Board (TSB) [http://www.innovateuk.org/]
* The Design Council [http://www.designcouncil.org.uk/]

In addition DIUS was the sponsor department for [NESTA] - the National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts ([http://www.nesta.org.uk])

Only some of DIUS's functions were UK-wide: it oversaw the science budget, provided through the Research Councils, for the UK as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/ Research councils UK]&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, education is a [[devolved matter]] and there were corresponding departments in the [[Northern Ireland Executive]], [[Scottish Government]] and [[Welsh Assembly Government]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.com/pa/cm200809/cmselect/cmwelaf/57/5702.htm House of Commons Welsh Affairs Committee - First Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225164340/http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.com/pa/cm200809/cmselect/cmwelaf/57/5702.htm |date=2012-02-25 }} Cross-border provision of public services for Wales: further and higher education&lt;/ref&gt;

The only [[Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills]] was the Rt Hon [[John Denham (UK politician)|John Denham]] MP.

The first Permanent Secretary, [[Ian Watmore]], moved to a new appointment, leading to the appointment of [[Jon Shortridge|Sir Jon Shortridge]].

The Department's strategic objectives were to
{{quote|
*Accelerate the commercial exploitation of creativity and knowledge, through innovation and research, to create wealth, grow the economy, build successful businesses and improve quality of life. 
*Improve the skills of the population throughout their working lives to create a workforce capable of sustaining economic competitiveness, and enable individuals to thrive in the global economy. 
*Build social and community cohesion through improved social justice, civic participation and economic opportunity by raising aspirations and broadening participation, progression and achievement in learning and skills. 
*Pursue global excellence in research and knowledge, promote the benefits of science in society, and deliver science, technology, engineering and mathematics skills in line with employer demand. 
*Strengthen the capacity, quality and reputation of the Further and Higher Education systems and institutions to support national economic and social needs. 
*Encourage better use of science in Government, foster public service innovation, and support other Government objectives which depend on DIUS’ expertise and remit.
A number of education functions of the former DfES (largely those focussed on the 14 - 19 age group) were taken over by the [[Department for Children, Schools and Families]].

'''Dicalcium phosphate''' is the [[calcium phosphate]] with the formula CaHPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and its dihydrate. The "di" prefix in the common name arises because the formation of the HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2–&lt;/sup&gt; anion involves the removal of two protons from [[phosphoric acid]], H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. It is also known as '''dibasic calcium phosphate''' or '''calcium monohydrogen phosphate'''. Dicalcium phosphate is used as a [[food additive]], it is found in some [[toothpaste]]s as a [[polishing]] agent and is a [[biomaterial]].&lt;ref name="StudiesinInorganicvol20"&gt;{{cite book |last=Corbridge |first=D. |title=Studies in inorganic Chemistry vol. 20|publisher=Elsevier Science B.V. |date=1995 |pages=169–305 |chapter=Chapter 3: Phosphates |isbn=0-444-89307-5|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444893079500088|access-date=January 30, 2015}}{{Subscription or libraries|sentence|via=[[ScienceDirect]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Salinas2013"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1= Salinas|first1= Antonio J.|last2=Vallet-Regi|first2=Maria|year=2013|title=Bioactive ceramics: from bone grafts to tissue engineering |journal= RSC Advances|volume=3|issue=28|pages=11116–11131|publisher=[[Royal Society of Chemistry]] |jstor= |doi=10.1039/C3RA00166K   |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1039/C3RA00166K   |format= |accessdate= 15 February 2015  |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparation==
Dibasic calcium phosphate is produced by the neutralization of [[calcium hydroxide]] with [[phosphoric acid]], which precipitates the dihydrate as a solid. At 60&amp;nbsp;°C the anhydrous form is precipitated:&lt;ref name="Bioactive"/&gt;
:H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CaHPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

To prevent degradation that would form [[hydroxyapatite]], [[sodium pyrophosphate]] or [[magnesium phosphate tribasic|trimagnesium phosphate octahydrate]] are added when for example, dibasic calcium phosphate dihydrate is to be used as a polishing agent in toothpaste.&lt;ref name="StudiesinInorganicvol20" /&gt;

In a continuous process [[calcium chloride|CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] can be treated with [[diammonium phosphate|(NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] to form the dihydrate:
:CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → CaHPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;•2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
A slurry of the dihydrate is then heated to around 65–70&amp;nbsp;°C to form anhydrous CaHPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; as a crystalline precipitate, typically as flat diamondoid crystals, which are suitable for further processing.&lt;ref name="ROPPchapter4"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ropp |first1= R.C.|last2= |first2= |last3= |first3= |last4= |first4= |year=2013 |chapter= Chapter 4 - Group 15 (N, P, As, Sb and Bi) Alkaline Earth Compounds|chapterurl=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444595508000041 |editor1-last= |editor1-first= |editor2-last= |editor2-first= |title=Encyclopedia of the Alkaline Earth Compounds |url= |volume=1 |issue= |edition= |location= |publisher=Elsevier |publication-date= |pages= |bibcode= |doi=10.1016/B978-0-444-59550-8.00004-1 |isbn=978-0-444-59550-8 |issn= |jstor= |access-date= |via= |subscription= }}{{Subscription or libraries|sentence|via=[[ScienceDirect]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dibasic calcium phosphate dihydrate is formed in "brushite" calcium phosphate cements (CPC's), which have medical applications.

:Ca&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + Ca(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;•H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 7 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 4 CaHPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;•2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

==Structure==
Three (3) forms of dicalcium phosphate are known: 
* [[dihydrate]], CaHPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;•2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O ('DPCD'), the mineral [[brushite]]
* hemihydrate, CaHPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;•0.5H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
* [[anhydrous]] CaHPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, ('DCPA'), the mineral [[monetite]]. Below pH 4.8 the dihydrate and anhydrous forms of dicalcium phosphate are the most stable (insoluble) of the calcium phosphates.

The structure of the anhydrous and dihydrated forms have been determined by [[X-ray crystallography]].  The dihydrate (shown in table above) adopts a layered structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Crystal structure of brushite, calcium hydrogen orthophosphate dihydrate: A neutron-diffraction investigation|author1=Curry, N.A.|author2=Jones, D.W.|journal= of the Chemical Society A|year=1971|pages=3725–3729}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:CaHPO4(H2O)2portion.jpg|thumb|left|Portion of the lattice of dicalcium phosphate dihydrate, highlighting the [[coordination number|8-coordinated]] Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; center and the location the protons on three ligands (green = Ca, red = oxygen, orange = phosphorus, white = hydrogen).]]

==Uses and occurrence==
Dibasic calcium phosphate is mainly used as a [[dietary supplement]] in prepared breakfast cereals, dog treats, enriched flour, and noodle products. It is also used as a [[tableting agent]] in some pharmaceutical preparations, including some products meant to eliminate [[body odor]]. Dibasic calcium phosphate is also found in some dietary calcium supplements (e.g. Bonexcin). It is used in poultry feed.  It is also used in some toothpastes as a [[Calculus (dental)|tartar]] control agent.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Klaus Schrödter, Gerhard Bettermann, Thomas Staffel, Friedrich Wahl, Thomas Klein, Thomas Hofmann "Phosphoric Acid and Phosphates" in ''Ullmann’s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'' 2008, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a19_465.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heating dicalcium phosphate gives [[dicalcium diphosphate]], a useful polishing agent:
:2 CaHPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  →  Ca&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

The '''Dratshang Lhentshog''' ([[Dzongkha]]: {{big|གྲྭ་ཚང་ལྷན་ཚོགས་}}; [[Wylie transliteration|Wylie]]: ''grwa-tshang lhan-tshogs'') is the Commission for the Monastic Affairs of [[Bhutan]].&lt;ref name=CoBE-gloss&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.constitution.bt/TsaThrim%20Eng%20(A5).pdf |format=PDF |title=Constitution of the Kingdom of Bhutan (English) – Glossary |publisher=Government of Bhutan |date=2008-07-18 |accessdate=2010-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706162637/http://www.constitution.bt/TsaThrim%20Eng%20%28A5%29.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Constitution of Bhutan|2008 Constitution]], it is the bureaucracy that oversees the [[Drukpa Kagyu]] sect that is the [[state religion]] of Bhutan. Although Bhutan has a state religion, the role of the religious bureaucracy ideally complements secular institutions within a [[dual system of government]].

==Composition and Function==
Under the [[Constitution of Bhutan|2008 Constitution]], the Dratshang Lhentshog is made up of seven members: the [[Je Khenpo]] as Chairman; the Five Lopons ([[Dzongkha]]: སློབ་དཔོན་ལྔ་; [[Wylie transliteration|Wylie]]: ''slob-dpon lnga'') of the Zhung Dratshang ([[Dzongkha]]: གཞུང་གྲྭ་ཚང་; [[Wylie transliteration|Wylie]]: ''gzhung grwa-tshang''; "Central Monastic Body"&lt;ref name=CoBE-gloss/&gt;); and a civil servant Secretary.&lt;ref name=CoBE-3&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.constitution.bt/TsaThrim%20Eng%20(A5).pdf |format=PDF |title=Constitution of the Kingdom of Bhutan (English) – Article 3 |publisher=Government of Bhutan |date=2008-07-18 |accessdate=2010-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706162637/http://www.constitution.bt/TsaThrim%20Eng%20%28A5%29.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the 2008 Constitution, it is mandated that the Zhung Dratshang and ''rabdeys'' (monastic bodies in [[dzong]]s other than [[Punakha]] and [[Thimphu]])&lt;ref name=CoBE-gloss/&gt; receive state funding and facilities adequate to support the [[Drukpa Kagyu]] sect.&lt;ref name=CoBE-3/&gt;

The Five Lopons recommend a learned and respected monk ordained in accordance with the [[Drukpa Lineage|Druk-lu]], having the nine qualities of a spiritual master, and being accomplished in ''ked-dzog'' (spiritual development and completion),&lt;ref name=DWBDict&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diamondway-buddhism.org/diction/diction.htm |title=Tibetan-English-Dictionary of Buddhist Teaching &amp; Practice |publisher=Rangjung Yeshe Translations &amp; Publications |work=Diamond Way Buddhism Worldwide |year=1996 |accessdate=2010-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328014624/http://www.diamondway-buddhism.org/diction/diction.htm |archivedate=2010-03-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[Druk Gyalpo|King of Bhutan]]. The King then appoints that monk to the office of [[Je Khenpo]].&lt;ref name=CoBE-3/&gt; In turn, the Lopons are appointed on the same criteria by the Je Khenpo on the advice of the remaining members of the Dratshang Lhentshog.&lt;ref name=CoBE-3/&gt;

The sitting [[Je Khenpo]] is the formal leader of the southern branch of the [[Drukpa Kagyu]] sect, which is part of the [[Kagyu]] tradition of [[Tibetan Buddhism|Himalayan Buddhism]]. The primary duty of the Je Khenpo is to lead the Dratshang Lhentshog and to arbitrate on matters of doctrine, assisted by the Five Lopons.&lt;ref name=USLCCS2&gt;{{cite book|last1=Worden |first1=Robert L. |last2=Savada |first2=Andrea Matles (ed.) |title=Nepal and Bhutan: Country Studies |chapter=Chapter 6 - Bhutan: Religious Tradition |edition=3rd |year=1991 |publisher=Federal Research Division, [[United States Library of Congress]] |isbn=0-8444-0777-1 |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/bttoc.html |accessdate=2010-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Je Khenpo is also responsible for many important liturgical and religious duties across the country.

The '''Farm Labor Organizing Committee (FLOC)''', [[AFL-CIO]], is a [[trade union|labor union]] representing [[migrant workers|migrant farm workers]] in the [[Midwestern United States]] and [[North Carolina]].

==History==
FLOC was founded in [[Toledo, Ohio]], in 1967 by [[Baldemar Velasquez]].&lt;ref name="Movement"&gt;Barger and Reza, ''The Farm Labor Movement in the Midwest,'' 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; A migrant worker who had worked in the fields since he was six years old, Velasquez led his first strike at the age of 12.&lt;ref name="Franklin"&gt;Franklin, "Farm Workers' Group Pushes for Better Pay, Rights," ''Chicago Tribune,'' April 8, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time he was 20 years old and a college student, Velasquez had already faced numerous beatings and arrests. But in 1967, with the help of his father and others, Velasquez organized FLOC among migrant field workers picking tomatoes in Ohio.&lt;ref name="Movement" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Founder"&gt;"FLOC Founder to Speak on Pesticide Poisoning," ''The Monitor,'' August 23, 1999; Rosenbaum, "Farm Labor Organizing Committee (FLOC): Grassroots Organizing for the Empowerment of the Migrant Farm Worker Community," ''Culture and Agriculture,'' Fall 1993; Rosenbaum, "Unionization of Tomato Field Workers in Northwest Ohio, 1967–1969," ''Labor History,'' Summer 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

FLOC's initial organizing strategy was to focus on workers, as most unions did. FLOC organizers followed migrant workers year-round, moving south to Texas and Florida every winter to build an organizing base.&lt;ref name="Power"&gt;"The Power of Organizing: Securing Farmworkers' Rights," ''Multinational Monitor,'' May 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1977, however, FLOC had only 700 members.&lt;ref name="Founder" /&gt;

===Campbell's Soup boycott===
In 1978, Velasquez decided to adopt a new organizing strategy. The union believed that Ohio tomato growers would be unable to recruit enough workers to see them through a long strike. So that year 2,000 FLOC members walked off their jobs in Ohio. While some growers were willing to negotiate, big canners such as the [[Campbell Soup Company]] were unwilling to pay the higher prices which would accompany a unionized workforce. FLOC initiated a boycott of Campbell's. Six years later, not much had changed even though FLOC had conducted a well-publicized 560-mile march from Toledo to Campbell Soup headquarters in [[Camden, New Jersey]], in 1983. Even the support of the [[National Council of Churches]] and a group of Catholic bishops in Ohio failed to sway the company.&lt;ref name="Movement" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair, "Saucy Union Battles Tomato Giants," ''Washington Post,'' July 8, 1982; Serrin, "Migrant Workers Organize a Boycott of Campbell," ''New York Times,'' July 2, 1984; "Bishops in Ohio Support Boycott of Campbell," ''Associated Press,'' June 18, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, FLOC asked labor organizer and consultant [[Ray Rogers (labor activist)|Ray Rogers]] for help. Rogers developed a [[comprehensive campaign|corporate campaign]] strategy which included a [[shareholder resolution|resolution]] and well-publicized demonstration at a Campbell Soup shareholder meeting. " 'You had these little nuns get up at stockholders' meetings saying I have one share and you're a dirty so and so,' says [[John Thomas Dunlop|John Dunlop]], secretary of labor in the [[Gerald Ford|Ford]] administration, who was involved in the FLOC battle."&lt;ref name="Waldman"&gt;Waldman, "The Best and the Worst of American Unions," ''Washington Monthly,'' July–August 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; The company's public image began to suffer. FLOC then targeted three members of Campbell's board of directors for economic pressure. FLOC also picketed [[CoreStates|Philadelphia National Bank]], one of Campbell's major creditors. Shortly thereafter, depositors threatened to pull $500,000 out of the bank.&lt;ref name="Movement" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Waldman" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Farm Group Boycotting Campbell Puts Focus on Financial Concerns," ''Associated Press,'' November 27, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FLOC marches to Camden New Jersey.jpg|thumb|FLOC marches to Camden, New Jersey, to put pressure on the Campbell's Soup Co.]]
In 1985, Campbell's agreed to establish a commission to implement an [[poverty reduction|anti-poverty program]] among its workers. Chaired by Dunlop, the commission began acting as a labor relations board.&lt;ref&gt;The [[National Labor Relations Act]] exempts agricultural workers from federal labor law.&lt;/ref&gt; In the fall of 1985, Campbell's officials agreed to negotiate with FLOC. In February 1986, FLOC, the growers and Campbell's announced a collective bargaining agreement which recognized FLOC as the workers' representative and provided for wage increases, [[grievance]] resolution, [[health insurance]], and committees to study pesticide safety, housing, health care, and day care issues. Campbell's agreed to purchase a fixed portion of growers' crops, a guarantee that allowed growers to increase wages without fear that Campbell's would take its business elsewhere. Shortly thereafter, FLOC reached deals with [[Pinnacle Foods|Vlasic]], [[H. J. Heinz Company|Heinz]], Green Bay Foods (now part of [[Dean Foods]]), Aunt Jane's (now part of Dean Foods) and Dean Foods. Within a year, FLOC had also signed pacts with 23 of the largest cucumber growers in Ohio and [[Michigan]] as well.&lt;ref name="Movement" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Waldman" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, "Campbell Soup Accord Ends a Decade of Strife," ''New York Times,'' February 24, 1986; Padawer, "Campbell's Boycott Brings Home the Settlement," ''Multinational Monitor,'' March 15, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schneider"&gt;Schneider, "Farm Pact in Midwest Portends Industry Shift," ''New York Times,'' August 7, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Howell"&gt;Howell, "Boycotting Pickles – Protesting Treatment of Migrant Workers," ''Christian Century,'' January 3, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continuing pressure===
FLOC continued to address issues related to its collective bargaining agreement in the late 1980s. Midwestern tomato farmers began complaining that the Campbell's Soup pact was not adequate. Campbell's purchased only a portion of their product, but the higher costs of wages and benefits affected their entire crop. Thus, Midwestern growers argued that they could no longer compete with cheap Mexican-grown products. Velasquez contacted Mexican farm worker unions, then in the midst of their own collective bargaining negotiations. Velasquez pressured the Mexican unions to demand significantly higher wages. The strategy was successful: The higher Mexican wages and benefits closed the price differential, and Midwestern growers no longer threatened to break their pact with FLOC.&lt;ref name="Franklin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Schneider" /&gt;

FLOC also fought back against subtle state-sponsored pressure. The union successfully sued the [[Ohio Highway Patrol]] (OHP) in September 1996 for stopping Hispanic migrant workers without justification and, in some cases, confiscating green cards. In December 1997, a federal district court judge issued a preliminary injunction restricting the OHP from questioning motorists about immigration status and seizing immigration documents.&lt;ref name="Southeast"&gt;"Midwest, Southeast," ''Rural Migration News,'' October 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

FLOC also began to expand its organizing efforts. The union sought to protect its gains in the cucumber fields by organizing migrant workers in the nation's second-largest cucumber-growing region—[[North Carolina]].&lt;ref name="Franklin" /&gt;

===Mt. Olive Pickle boycott===
FLOC began organizing cucumber pickers and pickle processing workers in North Carolina in the early 1990s. The union's efforts had made little headway by the mid-1990s, however. In October 1998, FLOC announced a boycott of [[Mount Olive Pickle Company]], the major pickle processor in the state. The union targeted the pickle processor because it correctly believed that growers would not agree to raise wages unless Mount Olive agreed to pay more for cucumbers. The organizing campaign was a difficult one. Four FLOC organizers were arrested on August 12, 1998 after visiting workers at a tobacco farm in [[Nash County, North Carolina]]. A local judge threw out the charges, saying the organizers had broken no laws.&lt;ref name="Southeast" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zagier, "Pickle Protest Planned," ''Charlotte News and Observer,'' October 11, 1998; Lecker, "Major Pickle Firm Faces FLOC Boycott in March," ''Toledo Blade,'' October 11, 1998; Feehan, "FLOC Claims Victory in North Carolina Arrest Case," ''Toledo Blade,'' August 15, 1998; Carmen, "Organizer of Union for Migrant Workers Takes on Pickle Giant," ''Columbus Dispatch,'' January 24, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

The union's five-year boycott of Mount Olive Pickle was ultimately successful. A highlight of the organizing drive was a four-day, 70-mile march from [[Mount Olive, North Carolina]], to [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, "Where Union Has Gone Before," ''Sojourners,'' September–October 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; On September 16, 2004, FLOC signed a collective bargaining agreement with Mount Olive and the growers. More than 6,000 of the state's 10,000 [[guest worker]]s joined FLOC, boosting the union's membership to more than 23,000.  The Association covered a number of cash crops, such as Christmas trees and tobacco, in addition to cucumbers.&lt;ref name="Franklin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Howell" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sengupta, "Farm Union Takes Aim at a Big Pickle Maker," ''New York Times,'' October 26, 2000; Greenhouse, "North Carolina Growers' Group Signs Union Contract for Mexican Workers," ''New York Times,'' September 17, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mount Olive agreement marked the first time an American labor union represented guest workers. FLOC quickly established a program to bring guest workers into the United States under the H-2A temporary guest worker visa program.&lt;ref name="Franklin" /&gt;

FLOC kept the pressure going in North Carolina even after the contract was ratified. In 2001, working with the [[United Farm Workers]], FLOC had sued the [[United States Department of Labor]] for failing to force cucumber growers to raise wages for more than 30,000 guest workers.&lt;ref&gt;Greenhouse, "Unions Say Labor Department Is Ignoring Wage Requirements," ''New York Times,'' June 27, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the union won its lawsuit. Employers were forced to pay $1.4 million lawsuit to North Carolina workers who had deductions illegally taken from their pay.&lt;ref name="Franklin" /&gt;

A federal district court judge ruled that growers belonging to the North Carolina Growers Association had to pay guest workers' visa and transportation fees. The ruling saved guest workers nearly $2 million a year.&lt;ref name="Mattson"&gt;Mattson, "Union Rep's Slaying Called Revenge," ''San Antonio Express-News,'' April 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

FLOC announced a second major organizing drive throughout the [[Deep South]] at its triennial convention in September 2006.

===Cruz assassination in Mexico===
On April 10, 2007, FLOC organizer Santiago Rafael Cruz was found bound and beaten to death in the group's office in [[Monterrey]], [[Mexico]]. FLOC had opened an office next to the U.S. consulate in the city in 2005 to help guest workers process their visas and to organize these incoming guest workers into the union.  However, when Mexican police announced that a suspect had been arrested in Cruz's death, they stated "he died for failing to deliver on a shady $4,500 promise to provide visas for the friends of his alleged killer".&lt;ref name="ExCon"&gt;Mattson, "Ex-Con Jailed in April Killing of Farm Labor Organizer," ''San Antonio Express-News,'' May 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The $4,500 was to arrange for documents for "other people so they could go to the United States to work...".&lt;ref name="ExCon" /&gt; The group's Monterrey offices had been broken into a several times in the past year, and union staff members had received a number of threats. Cruz, who was 29 years old, had supervised the Monterrey office for less than a month. The [[Nuevo León]] state police said Cruz's murder was not related to trafficking in illegal narcotics, but rather due to "a fight between unions" or "an internal fight" within FLOC. FLOC vigorously disputed the findings. FLOC officials claimed that [[organized crime]] figures had murdered Cruz in retaliation for FLOC's efforts to resolve grievances concerning abuses in the guest worker recruiting system (which FLOC says are dominated by criminal syndicates). FLOC petitioned the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] for protective measures. The Commission immediately granted the petition, which requires that the Mexican government provide FLOC members and staff with adequate law enforcement and security while in Mexico.&lt;ref name="Mattson" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"FLOC Worker from Toledo Killed in Mexico," ''Toledo Blade,'' April 11, 2007; Hall, "Response to Toledoan's Death," ''Toledo Blade,'' April 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two months after Cruz' death, the Mexican government agreed to require local police officers to sign in daily at FLOC's Monterrey office and agreed to install security cameras throughout the building where FLOC's offices are located. FLOC President Velasquez and [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Marcy Kaptur]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[Ohio|OH]]) met with officials from office of the [[Attorney General of Mexico]] to resolve problems with the implementation of the new security measures. Although the IACHR has been pressuring the Mexican government since early May to install the cameras, the Nuevo León and federal government disagree over who will pay for them. The police officer visits to the union offices also have been less frequent than promised.&lt;ref&gt;Seitz, "Security Measures for FLOC May Grow," ''Toledo Blade,'' July 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===R.J. Reynolds Campaign===
In 2006, the North Carolina branch of FLOC began its new campaign against [[R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company]].  FLOC president Baldemar Velazquez spoke of the tragic and preventable deaths of at least four migrant tobacco workers in the summer of 2006 in [[North Carolina]].    The aim of the new campaign was to put pressure on [[Big Tobacco]] executives to change its abusive procurement system.

Tobacco corporations have control throughout the levels of tobacco procurement.  Due to their [[monopoly]], they control the prices they pay growers, and therefore the wages paid to field workers.  There are deceptive layers of subcontractors throughout this system, designed to avoid responsibility for what happens down the chain.  Nevertheless, tobacco corporations have the power to change this system and directly improve the lives of the workers who harvest their product.

FLOC seeks to change the abusive structure of the procurement system through a multi-party agreement between the corporation, the growers and the farmworkers.  Thus far, Reynolds CEO Susan Ivey has refused to meet with FLOC representatives.  FLOC continues to put pressure on Reynolds to meet and attended a May 2008 shareholder meeting to raise the issue and to support a shareholder resolution calling for the company to establish a human rights protocol throughout its supply chain. The resolution had the support of the shareholder advisory service ISS and received a significant 13% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Kristin. "Farm union targets RJR." ''News &amp; Observer.'' October 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 3, 2012, FLOC and several different organizations came together and disrupted a meeting of CEOs at R.J. Reynolds Headquarters, demanding that the crimes of the company against tobacco farmworkers be acknowledged and that certain action be taken to relieve the pain and suffering these workers are enduring in the tobacco fields. The short-term goal was in pressuring them to finally set up a meeting between R.J.R. and FLOC. Their goal was achieved. Soon after the meeting, FLOC and their allies flooded the streets of Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and held a long march to both celebrate their first victory and to continue the ongoing pressure against R.J.R.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, B.J., "Winston-Salem picket and march in support of NC tobacco farmworkers", ''Fight Back! News'', May 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
FLOC is governed by its membership. The membership elects delegates, who meet every four years (effective Convention 2009). FLOC held its first membership meeting—called a "constitutional convention"—in 1979. Members set dues, approve policy statements and broad programmatic guidance, and elect officers. Currently, FLOC members pay 2.5% of their base wages as dues.&lt;ref name="Southeast" /&gt;

Between conventions, FLOC is governed by a Board of Directors. The board includes the three officers—the international president, international vice president, and international secretary-treasurer—and four at-large board members. All board members are elected for four-year terms. At its 11th Constitutional Convention in 2009, delegates elected the following individuals as board members:
*Baldemar Velásquez, president
*Justin Flores, vice president
*Beatriz Maya, secretary-treasurer
*Diego Reyes, member at large
*Angelita Morrisroe, member at large
*Belia Garrobo, member at large
*Christiana Velasquez, member at large

Between executive board meetings, FLOC's day-to-day operations are governed by the three officers, led by the president.

FLOC has a number of programs which it has implemented to improve the lives of its members. Since 1971, FLOC has offered educational programs, established food and fuel cooperatives, and run legal clinics for both members and non-members.&lt;ref name="Power" /&gt;

After it achieved its contract with Campbell's Soup, FLOC sought a charter from the [[AFL-CIO]]. The AFL-CIO initially chartered FLOC as a [[Directly Affiliated Local Union|directly affiliated local union]].&lt;ref name="Power" /&gt; However, in February 2006, FLOC changed its affiliation with the AFL-CIO and became a fully chartered international union.&lt;ref name="Franklin" /&gt;

While FLOC has a good working relationship with the United Farm Workers (UFW), neither union has sought merger with the other. In 1993, FLOC president Velasquez expressed doubt that his members would approve a merger.&lt;ref name="Power" /&gt;

'''Frank Holmes''' (1874 – January 1947), known affectionately by Arabs as "Abu Naft" (''the Father of Oil''), was a British-New Zealander mining engineer, geologist and oil concession hunter. Following distinguished service in [[World War I]], he was granted the title of honorary Major and was thereafter known as Major Frank Holmes in his civilian life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/30551/pages/2635/page.pdf  London Gazette, 1 March 1918]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
He was born in 1874 on at a remote work camp in New Zealand where his father was building a bridge. He attended [[Otago Boys' High School]], Dunedin in 1888–89. At the age of 17, he was apprenticed to his uncle who was the general manager of a gold mine in South Africa. For two decades, specialising in gold and tin, he worked as a mining engineer all over the world – Australia, China, Russia, Malaya, Mexico, Uruguay and Nigeria.

During [[World War I]], he was a quartermaster in the British Army. In his efforts to source food and supplies for the British Army in [[Mesopotamia]] (today's Iraq), Holmes travelled widely through the Middle East and may have heard rumours of a possible oil seepage on the eastern seaboard of the Arabian peninsula. This, together with a close study of Admiralty maps of the area, appears to have triggered an abiding interest in oil in the region. By 1918, he was writing to his wife that "I personally believe that there will be developed an immense oil field running from [[Kuwait]] right down the mainland coast [of eastern Arabia]".&lt;ref&gt;Aileen Keating, ''Mirage'', page 757.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Search for oil concessions==

===Arabia===
In 1920, Holmes helped set up the Eastern and General Syndicate Ltd in London to develop, among other things, oil ventures in the Middle East. In 1922 he travelled to [[Arabia]] to discuss the possibility of an oil concession with Emir [[Ibn Saud]], who ruled parts of the eastern peninsula. With Ibn Saud’s permission, he carried out a survey over four weeks in the desert and returned to [[Hofuf]] with earth samples which he claimed bore traces of oil. In order to allay the suspicions of British officials, Holmes claimed that he was looking for a rare butterfly, the Black Admiral of Qatif, although this deception appears not to have been effective.&lt;ref&gt;Harold R.P. Dickson, Dickson, ''Kuwait and Her Neighbours'', page 278.&lt;/ref&gt; At the Uqair conference later in the year, Holmes approached Ibn Saud with a view to finalising a concession document but the British High Commissioner, Sir [[Percy Cox]], persuaded Ibn Saud not to sign. It was only when the British government ended Ibn Saud’s annual stipend in 1923 that Ibn Saud considered himself free of British control and awarded a concession to Holmes for the region of al-Hasa. But when a subsequent survey was unfavourable, and a financially challenged Eastern and General Syndicate failed to find a bidder, the concession for al-Hasa was allowed to lapse. Holmes, nevertheless, still entertained hopes of finding oil on [[Bahrain]] and concentrated his efforts there.

In 1932 Holmes travelled to [[Jeddah]], where negotiations for an oil concession were going between Ibn Saud, SOCAL and Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC) for a new concession for the al-Hasa province. When Ibn Saud’s adviser, the former British colonial officer [[Harry St. John Philby]], got wind of his arrival he attempted to deter Holmes from joining the negotiations by informing him that he was ''persona non grata'' in Jeddah and was remembered for the failure to exploit the first al-Hasa concession. There was also the matter of £6,000 rent owed to Ibn Saud. Holmes appeared undaunted. “Holmes does not seem to share the otherwise universally held belief that Ibn Saud regards him unfavourably,” wrote the IPC representative, [[Stephen Hemsley Longrigg]].&lt;ref&gt;For Philby’s version of events, see ''Arabian Oil Ventures'', pp. 98 – 99; for Longrigg’s version see his letter to J. Skirilos of 12 April 1933, PC/10A BP Archive, Warwick University; also see Keating, ''Mirage'', pp. 421 – 422.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Holmes probably had no intention of joining in but simply wanted to exclude the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait from the negotiations. After three days, during which time he met with Saudi finance minister Abdullah Suleiman, Holmes left Jeddah and took no part in the al-Hasa negotiations. The concession for al-Hasa (excluding the Neutral Zone) went to SOCAL. The company formed an operating company, the California Arabian Standard Oil Company (CASOC), joined forces with the Texas Oil Company and struck commercial oil at [[Dammam]] in March 1938. CASOC went on to become Aramco in 1944.

===Bahrain===
In 1923 he persuaded the sheikh of [[Bahrain]] to give him an oil concession in exchange for drilling water wells. Armed with a favourable geological report and rock samples, Holmes set out to interest a major oil company in drilling for oil in Bahrain. The Gulf Oil Company showed an interest but was constrained by the [[Red Line Agreement]] which prevented the company from drilling on Bahrain without the consent of their partners in the [[Iraq Petroleum Company]] (IPC). Their partners declined, so Gulf assigned its interest to [[Standard Oil of California]] (SOCAL) for $50,000. SOCAL went on to strike oil in June 1932.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Angela, ''Bahrain Oil and Development'' (Boulder CO, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Qatar===
In 1925, reports came into the [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]] that Holmes was showing an interest in [[Qatar]]. Holmes had visited the ruler Sheikh Abdullah in his desert tent. When the sheikh’s hunting dogs entered the tent and Holmes was able to identify the pedigree of one, the sheikh was most impressed. “If this man can identify one dog among so many, surely he can identify where our oil is hidden,” he said, declaring that Holmes was his choice for the Qatar oil concession.&lt;ref&gt;Comments of Husain Yateem reported in Mirage, Power Politics and the Hidden History of Arabian Oil by Aileen Keating, pages 214–215.&lt;/ref&gt; Holmes also presented the sheikh with a motor car. This prompted Anglo-Persian to send a survey party led by [[George Martin Lees]] to Qatar. There were no firm indications of oil, but when oil was struck on Bahrain, this and a favourable survey persuaded Anglo Persian to sign a concession agreement with the sheikh in 1935. Holmes, in the meantime, had found his energies taken up with oil negotiations in [[Kuwait]].

===Kuwait===
Kuwait lay outside the Red Line Agreement, so Gulf Oil was free to negotiate for an oil concession there, represented by Frank Holmes. When representatives of their rivals, Anglo-Persian, first attempted to negotiate with the Emir of Kuwait, Sheikh Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, they found that Holmes was well enconsced with the Sheikh with the result that the company appointed [[William Richard Williamson]] to counter Holmes' influence. Eventually, Anglo-Persian decided to join forces with Holmes, and together they created a 50–50 venture, the Kuwait Oil Company.  On 23 December 1934 Sheikh Ahmad signed an oil concession (covering the entire 15,800 square km of Kuwait for 75 years) to this new company and appointed Major Holmes as his representative in London.&lt;ref&gt;Rasoul Sorkhabi, “The Emergence of the Arabian Oil Industry,” GEO ExPro, 06/2008&lt;/ref&gt; Oil was struck in Kuwait in February 1938.

===Trucial Coast===
In 1937 Holmes was instructed by Petroleum Concessions Ltd – an associate company of IPC –  to complete oil concession agreements with the sheikhs of the [[Trucial Coast]] and the ruler of Oman but he proved dilatory and had to be relieved through ill-health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heard|first=David|title=From Pearls to Oil|year=2011|publisher=Motivate Publishing|location=Dubai|isbn=978-1860633119|pages=624}}&lt;/ref&gt;  “I am sure that if Holmes comes to the Gulf there will be the usual atmosphere of confusion and intrigue which he creates wherever he goes and which sooner or later gives us much unnecessary trouble,” wrote the British Political Resident from Bahrain,&lt;ref&gt;Correspondence in the records of the India Office, British Library, IOR/L/PS/12/233&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting a widespread suspicion among British officials that Holmes was a threat to their country's interests in the Persian Gulf. To another official, he was simply "a rover in the world of oil".&lt;ref&gt;Meeting Relating to Oil in the Persian Gulf, 26 April 1933, POWE 33/241/114869, National Archives, Kew, London&lt;/ref&gt;

==Achievements==
Described as being “of powerful physique, of blunt speech and great strength of character”&lt;ref&gt;A.T. Chisholm, Obituary in ''The Times'' of 5 February 1947, page 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Holmes possessed qualities of charm and generosity that won him the admiration of Arabs across the region, and he was able to invoke dreams of wealth among the many improverished shiekhs of the Arabian peninsula. Although not a trained petroleum geologist, he relied on a knowledge of geology gained as a mining engineer and a certain intuition (what Holmes described as his “nose for oil”&lt;ref&gt;Chisholm, Kuwait Oil Concession, pp 93–5&lt;/ref&gt;) to locate areas where oil might be found.&lt;ref&gt;Rasoul Sorkhabi , “The Emergence of the Arabian Oil Industry,” GEO ExPro, 06/2008&lt;/ref&gt; In the event, at a time when established opinion was generally pessimistic about finding oil in Arabia, Holmes’ predictions were remarkably accurate. It is for these reasons that he earned from Arabs the sobriquet “Abu Naft”, or the Father of Oil.

==Death==
After a short illness, Frank Holmes died of a heart attack in January 1947.

Born in [[Budapest]], Soros survived [[Nazi Germany]]-[[Hungary in World War II|occupied Hungary]] and immigrated to England in 1947 after Hungary was [[Soviet Occupation of Hungary|occupied by Soviet troops]]. He attended the [[London School of Economics]], graduating with a [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor's]] and eventually a [[Master's degree|master's]] degree in philosophy. Soros began his business career by taking various jobs at [[merchant bank]]s in England and then the United States, before starting his first [[hedge fund]], Double Eagle, in 1969. Profits from his first fund furnished the seed money to start [[Soros Fund Management]], his second hedge fund, in 1970. Double Eagle was renamed to [[Quantum Fund]] and was the principal firm Soros advised. At its founding, Quantum Fund had $12 million in [[assets under management]], and {{as of|2011|lc=y}} it had $25 billion, the majority of Soros's overall net worth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,964280,00.html|title=George Soros: World's Champion Bull Rider| last= Ungeheuer| first= Frederick| date= May 4, 1987| work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |issn=0040-781X|access-date=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soros is known as "The Man Who Broke the [[Bank of England]]" because of his [[Short (finance)|short sale]] of {{US$|10 billion}} worth of [[pounds sterling]], which made him a profit of $1&amp;nbsp;billion during the 1992 [[Black Wednesday|Black Wednesday UK currency crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ferguson |first=Niall |authorlink=Niall Ferguson |last2=Schlefer |first2=Jonathan |title=Who Broke the Bank of England? |date=September 9, 2009 |journal=Harvard Business School BGIE Unit Case No. 709-026 |ssrn=1485674 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on his early studies of philosophy, Soros formulated an application of [[Karl Popper]]'s [[reflexivity (social theory)|General Theory of Reflexivity]] to [[capital market]]s, which he claims renders him a clear picture of [[Economic bubble|asset bubbles]] and [[Value investing|fundamental]]/[[Stock market|market]] value of securities, as well as value discrepancies used for [[Short (finance)|shorting]] and [[Derivative (finance)|swapping]] stocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Open Society Foundations| title=George Soros Lecture Series: Financial Markets|date=October 11, 2010|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHSEEJDKJho| access-date= February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Soros was born in Budapest in the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–46)|Kingdom of Hungary]] to a well-to-do non-observant Jewish family, who, like many upper-middle class Hungarian Jews at the time, were uncomfortable with their roots. Soros has wryly described his home as a Jewish antisemitic home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Slater|first1=Robert|title=Soros: The Life, Ideas, and Impact of the World's Most Influential Investor|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional |isbn= 9780071608459 |page= 30| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=J7I26pZK8TUC&amp;pg=PA22|access-date=November 16, 2016|language=en|date=January 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother Erzsébet (also known as Elizabeth) came from a family that owned a thriving silk shop. His father [[Tivadar Soros|Tivadar]] (also known as Teodoro) was a lawyer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.uni-muenster.de/PeaCon/global-texte/r-m/soros-TheNewYorker.htm |work= [[The New Yorker]] | first= Jane| last= Mayer|title= The Money Man: Can George Soros's millions insure the defeat of President Bush?| date= October 18, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had been a prisoner of war during and after [[World War I]] until he escaped from Russia and rejoined his family in Budapest.&lt;ref name=Kaufman&gt;{{cite book| last= Kaufman| first= Michael T. |date= 2002| title= Soros: The Life and Times of a Messianic Billionaire| publisher= Alfred A.

Soros was 13 years old in March 1944 when [[Nazi Germany]] occupied Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&amp;ModuleId=10005458 |title=Holocaust Encyclopedia |publisher=Ushmm.org |access-date= October 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazis barred Jewish children from attending school, and Soros and the other schoolchildren were made to report to the [[Judenrat]] ("Jewish Council"), which had been established during the [[Operation Margarethe|occupation]]. Soros later described this time to writer [[Michael Lewis]]: "The Jewish Council asked the little kids to hand out the deportation notices. I was told to go to the Jewish Council. And there I was given these small slips of paper ...  I took this piece of paper to my father. He instantly recognized it. This was a list of Hungarian Jewish lawyers. He said, 'You deliver the slips of paper and tell the people that if they report they will be deported'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/74330/the-speculator| last= Lewis| first= Michael| date= January 10, 1994| title= The Speculator| work= [[The New Republic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Kaufman| first= Michael T.|title=Soros: The Life and Times of a Messianic Billionaire|publisher=Knopf|isbn=9780375405853|pages= 32–33| year= 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soros did not return to that job; his family survived the war by purchasing documents to say that they were Christians. Later that year at age 14, Soros posed as the Christian godson of an official of the collaborationist Hungarian government's Ministry of Agriculture, who himself had a Jewish wife in hiding. On one occasion, rather than leave the 14-year-old alone, the official took Soros with him while inventorizing a Jewish family's confiscated estate. Tivadar saved not only his immediate family but also many other Hungarian Jews, and George would later write that 1944 had been "the happiest [year] of his life," for it had given him the opportunity to witness his father's heroism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaufman|first1=Michael T.|title=Soros: The Life and Times of a Messianic Billionaire|publisher=Knopf|isbn=9780375405853|page=5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W1Jn4zYBom8C&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage|access-date=November 16, 2016|language=en|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaufman|first1=Michael T.|title=Soros: The Life and Times of a Messianic Billionaire|publisher=Knopf|isbn=9780375405853|page=37|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W1Jn4zYBom8C&amp;pg=PA37#v=onepage|access-date=November 16, 2016|language=en|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945, Soros survived the [[Siege of Budapest]], in which Soviet and German forces fought house-to-house through the city.

In 1947, Soros immigrated to England and became a student at the [[London School of Economics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgesoros.com/faqs/entry/georgesorosofficialbiography/ Official Biography] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122214827/http://www.georgesoros.com/faqs/entry/georgesorosofficialbiography/ |date=November 22, 2010 }}, retrieved March 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; While a student of the philosopher [[Karl Popper]], Soros worked as a railway porter and as a waiter, and once received £40 from a [[Quaker]] charity.&lt;ref name="NPR090409"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=111786652|title=Soros Uses Leverage To Aid New York Children|date=August 11, 2009|publisher=NPR|author=All Things Considered|access-date=October 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soros would sometimes stand at [[Speakers' Corner]] lecturing about the virtues of [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]] in [[Esperanto]], which he had learned from his father.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Delves Broughton, [https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/life/features/the-billionaire-taking-on-the-brexiteers-36587647.html The billionaire taking on the Brexiteers], Belfast Telegraph, February 10, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Soros took a [[Bachelor of Science]] in philosophy in 1951, and a [[Master of Science]] in philosophy in 1954, both from the London School of Economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/supportingLSE/NorthAmericanAdvisoryBoard.aspx|title=North American Advisory Board|work=lse.ac.uk|access-date=July 20, 2015|quote=Mr George Soros  (BSc Philosophy 1951, MSc Philosophy 1954) Chairman, Soros Fund Management|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170126130530/http://www.lse.ac.uk/supportingLSE/NorthAmericanAdvisoryBoard.aspx|archivedate=January 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investment career==

===Early business experience===
In a discussion at the [[Los Angeles World Affairs Council]] in 2006, Alvin Shuster, former foreign editor of the ''Los Angeles Times'', asked Soros, "How does one go from an immigrant to a financier? ... When did you realize that you knew how to make money?" Soros replied, "Well, I had a variety of jobs and I ended up selling fancy goods on the seaside, souvenir shops, and I thought, that's really not what I was cut out to do. So, I wrote to every managing director in every [[merchant bank]] in London, got just one or two replies, and eventually that's how I got a job in a merchant bank."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawac.org/speech-archive/pdf/2006/Soros_612.pdf Consequences of the War on Terror] September 20, 2006, Los Angeles World Affairs Council. Retrieved December 7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Singer and Friedlander===
In 1954, Soros began his financial career at the merchant bank [[Kaupthing Singer &amp; Friedlander#Singer &amp; Friedlander|Singer &amp; Friedlander]] of London. He worked as a clerk and later moved to the [[arbitrage]] department. A fellow employee, Robert Mayer, suggested he apply at his father's brokerage house, F.M. Mayer of New York.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arnold|first1=Glen|title=The Great Investors:  Lessons on Investing from Master Traders|date=2012|publisher=Pearson|location=United Kingdom|isbn=9780273743385|page=416}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===F. M. Mayer===
In 1956, Soros moved to New York City, where he worked as an arbitrage [[Trader (finance)|trader]] for F. M. Mayer (1956–59). He specialized in European stocks, which were becoming popular with U.S. institutional investors following the formation of the [[Coal and Steel Community]], which later became the [[Common Market]].&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Soros|first1=George|last2=Koenen|first2=Krisztina|last3=Wien|first3=Byron|title=Soros on Soros: Staying Ahead of the Curve|date=1995|publisher=J. Wiley|location=New York|isbn=9780471119777|page=326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wertheim and Co===
In 1959, after three years at F. M. Mayer, Soros moved to [[Wertheim &amp; Co.]]. He planned to stay for five years, enough time to save $500,000, after which he intended to return to England to study philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, Michael T., Soros: The Life and Times of a Messianic Billionaire, Chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt; He worked as an analyst of European securities until 1963.

During this period, Soros developed the theory of [[reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]] based on the ideas of his tutor at the [[London School of Economics]], [[Karl Popper]]. Reflexivity posits that market values are often driven by the fallible ideas of participants, not only by the economic fundamentals of the situation. Ideas and events influence each other in reflexive feedback loops.  Soros argued that this process leads to markets having procyclical "virtuous" or "vicious" cycles of boom and bust, in contrast to the equilibrium predictions of more standard neoclassical economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Fallibility, reflexivity, and the human uncertainty principle|first=George|last=Soros|volume=20|issue=4|pages=309–329|doi=10.1080/1350178x.2013.859415|journal=Journal of Economic Methodology|year = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Soros, George|title=The New Paradigm for Financial Markets |publisher=Public Affairs|location=New York|year=2008|isbn=978-1-58648-683-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arnhold and S. Bleichroeder===
From 1963 to 1973, Soros's experience as a vice president at [[Arnhold and S. Bleichroeder]] resulted in little enthusiasm for the job; business was slack following the introduction of the [[Interest Equalization Tax]], which undermined the viability of Soros's European trading. He spent the years from 1963 to 1966 with his main focus on the revision of his philosophy dissertation. In 1966 he started a fund with $100,000 of the firm's money to experiment with his trading strategies. But he was principally motivated by a desire to assert himself as an investor to profit from his [[Reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]] insights.

In 1969, Soros set up the Double Eagle [[hedge fund]] with $4m of investors' capital including $250,000 of his own money.&lt;ref&gt;''Soros on Soros'', p47&lt;/ref&gt; It was based in Curaçao, Dutch Antilles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Koven|first1=Steven G.|last2=Götzke|first2=Frank|title=American immigration policy confronting the nation's challenges|date=2010|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|location=New York|isbn=978-0-387-95940-5|page=89|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Double Eagle itself was an offshoot of Arnhold and S. Bleichroeder's First Eagle fund established by Soros and that firm's chairman [[Henry H. Arnhold]] in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Flitter |first1=Emily |title=Henry Arnhold, Patriarch of a Storied Banking Family, Dies at 96 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/29/business/henry-arnhold-dead.html |accessdate=September 9, 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, the Double Eagle Fund had $12&amp;nbsp;million and formed the basis of the Soros Fund. George Soros and [[Jim Rogers]] received returns on their share of capital and 20 percent of the profits each year.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

===Soros Fund Management===
In 1970, Soros founded [[Soros Fund Management]] and became its chairman. Among those who held senior positions there at various times were Jim Rogers, [[Stanley Druckenmiller]], Mark Schwartz, Keith Anderson, and Soros's two sons.&lt;ref name="georgesoros.com"&gt;[http://www.georgesoros.com/faqs/archive/category/finance/ "George Soros"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711084948/http://www.georgesoros.com/faqs/archive/category/finance/ |date=July 11, 2011 }}.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, due to perceived conflicts of interest limiting his ability to run the two funds, Soros resigned from the management of the Double Eagle Fund. He then established the Soros Fund and gave investors in the Double Eagle Fund the option of transferring to that or staying with Arnhold and S. Bleichroeder.

It was later renamed as the [[Quantum Fund]], named after the physical theory of [[quantum mechanics]]. By that time the value of the fund had grown to $12m, only a small proportion of which was Soros's own money. He and Jim Rogers reinvested their returns from the fund, and also a large part of their 20% performance fees, thereby expanding their stake.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

By 1981, the fund had grown to $400m, and then a 22% loss in that year and substantial redemptions by some of the investors reduced it to $200m.&lt;ref&gt;''Soros on Soros'', p56&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, Soros announced that he had returned funds from outside investors' money (valued at $1&amp;nbsp;billion) and instead invested funds from his $24.5&amp;nbsp;billion family fortune, due to changes in [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] disclosure rules, which he felt would compromise his duties of confidentiality to his investors. The fund had at that time averaged over 20% per year compound returns.&lt;ref name="Guardian711"&gt;{{cite news | last =Dominic | first =Rushe | title =George Soros to close hedge fund management group to outside investors | work = [[The Guardian]] | date =July 26, 2011 | url= https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jul/26/george-soros-to-close-hedge-fund | access-date = July 27, 2011 | location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the Quantum Fund made $5.5&amp;nbsp;billion, making it again the most successful hedge fund in history. Since its inception in 1973, the fund has generated $40&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.institutionalinvestorsalpha.com/Article/3307105/Study-Soros-Tops-Historical-Hedge-Fund-Performers.htm{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fund announced in 2015 that it would inject $300 million to help finance the expansion of Fen Hotels, an Argentine hotel company. The funds will develop 5,000 rooms over the next three years throughout various Latin American countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = George Soros Puts Money on Latin America Hotels|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/soros-puts-money-on-latin-america-hotels-1447785866|newspaper = The Wall Street Journal|access-date = November 22, 2015|issn = 0099-9660|first = Craig|last = Karmin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1992-pound short====
Soros had been building a huge [[Short (finance)#Currency|short position]] in pounds sterling for months leading up to September 1992. Soros had recognized the unfavorable position of the United Kingdom in the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]]. For Soros, the rate at which the United Kingdom was brought into the European Exchange Rate Mechanism was too high, their inflation was also much too high (triple the German rate), and British interest rates were hurting their asset prices.&lt;ref name="amazon1"&gt;{{cite book|title=More Money Than God: Hedge Funds and the Making of a New Elite |author=Sebastian Mallaby |isbn=9781594202551 |publisher=Penguin Press HC |date=June 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By September 16, 1992, the day of [[Black Wednesday]], Soros's fund had [[short (finance)|sold short]] more than $10&amp;nbsp;billion in [[pound sterling|pound]]s,&lt;ref name="georgesoros.com" /&gt; profiting from the UK government's reluctance to either raise its interest rates to levels comparable to those of other [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]] countries or [[floating exchange rate|float]] its currency.

Finally, the UK withdrew from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, [[Devaluation|devaluing]] the pound. Soros's profit on the bet was estimated at over $1&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;Mallaby, Sebastian, ''More Money Than God'', Penguin, 2010, p. 167. {{ISBN|978-1-59420-255-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was dubbed "the man who [[breaking the bank|broke the Bank]] of England".&lt;ref&gt;Litterick, David (September 13, 2002), [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2773265/Billionaire-who-broke-the-Bank-of-England.html "Billionaire who Broke the Bank of England"], ''The Telegraph''.&lt;/ref&gt; The estimated cost of Black Wednesday to the [[HM Treasury|UK Treasury]] was £3.4&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name=telly&gt;{{cite news|last1=Johnston|first1=Philip|title=Black Wednesday: The day that Britain went over the edge|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/currency/9533474/Black-Wednesday-The-day-that-Britain-went-over-the-edge.html|access-date=April 13, 2015|work=The Telegraph|date=September 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 26, 1992, ''The New York Times'' quoted Soros as saying: "Our total [[Position (finance)|position]] by Black Wednesday had to be worth almost $10&amp;nbsp;billion. We planned to sell more than that. In fact, when [[Norman Lamont]] said just before the [[devaluation]] that he would borrow nearly $15&amp;nbsp;billion to defend sterling, we were amused because that was about how much we wanted to sell."

[[Stanley Druckenmiller]], who traded under Soros, originally saw the weakness in the pound and stated: "[Soros's] contribution was pushing him to take a gigantic position."&lt;ref&gt;Steven Drobny, ''Inside the House of Money'', John Wiley &amp; Sons: Hoboken, NJ, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Soros on Soros: Staying Ahead of the Curve'' (John Wiley, 1995), {{ISBN|978-0-471-12014-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, during the [[Asian financial crisis]], the prime minister of Malaysia, [[Mahathir bin Mohamad]], accused Soros of using the wealth under his control to punish the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)]] for welcoming [[Myanmar]] as a member. Following on a history of [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] remarks, Mahathir made specific reference to Soros's Jewish background ("It is a Jew who triggered the currency plunge"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/telegraph-view/3597972/Mahathirs-dark-side.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Mahathir's dark side | date=October 24, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and implied Soros was orchestrating the crash as part of a larger Jewish conspiracy. Nine years later, in 2006, Mahathir met with Soros and afterward stated that he accepted that Soros had not been responsible for the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070111172941/http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200612/s1812946.htm "Malaysian ex-premier Mahathir and billionaire Soros end feud"]. [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]. Agence France-Presse. December 15, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998's ''The Crisis of Global Capitalism: Open Society Endangered'' Soros explained his role in the crisis as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The financial crisis that originated in Thailand in 1997 was particularly unnerving because of its scope and severity ... By the beginning of 1997, it was clear to Soros Fund Management that the discrepancy between the trade account and the capital account was becoming untenable. We sold short the Thai baht and the Malaysian ringgit early in 1997 with maturities ranging from six months to a year. (That is, we entered into contracts to deliver at future dates Thai baht and Malaysian ringgit that we did not currently hold.) Subsequently, Prime Minister Mahathir of Malaysia accused me of causing the crisis, a wholly unfounded accusation. We were not sellers of the currency during or several months before the crisis; on the contrary, we were buyers when the currencies began to decline—we were purchasing ringgits to realize the profits on our earlier speculation. (Much too soon, as it turned out. We left most of the potential gain on the table because we were afraid that Mahathir would impose capital controls. He did so, but much later.)&lt;ref&gt;Soros, George (1999). ''The Crisis of Global Capitalism: Open Society Endangered'', 2nd ed., PublicAffairs, {{ISBN|978-1-891620-27-0}}, pp. 208–209.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1999, economist [[Paul Krugman]] was critical of Soros's effect on financial markets.

&lt;blockquote&gt;[N]obody who has read a business magazine in the last few years can be unaware that these days there really are investors who not only move money in anticipation of a currency crisis, but actually do their best to trigger that crisis for fun and profit. These new actors on the scene do not yet have a standard name; my proposed term is 'Soroi'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The accidental theorist: and other dispatches from the dismal science|last=Krugman|first=Paul|authorlink=Paul Krugman|year=1999|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York|page=160|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In an interview regarding the [[late-2000s recession]], Soros referred to it as the most serious crisis since the 1930s. According to Soros, [[market fundamentalism]] with its assumption that markets will correct themselves with no need for government intervention in financial affairs has been "some kind of an [[ideological]] excess." In Soros's view, the markets' moods—a "mood" of the markets being a prevailing bias or optimism/pessimism with which the markets look at reality—"actually can reinforce themselves so that there are these initially self-reinforcing but eventually unsustainable and self-defeating boom/bust sequences or bubbles."&lt;ref&gt;''Bill Moyers Journal'', "George Soros on the financial crisis," published October 10, 2008, at &lt;nowiki&gt;http://odeo.com&lt;/nowiki&gt;, [https://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/10102008/transcript1.html full transcript] and [http://odeo.com/episodes/23475214-George-Soros-on-the-financial-crisis podcast] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206215514/http://odeo.com/episodes/23475214-George-Soros-on-the-financial-crisis |date=February 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reaction to the late-2000s recession, he founded the [[Institute for New Economic Thinking]] in October 2009. This is a think tank composed of international economic, business, and financial experts, who are mandated to investigate radical new approaches to organizing the international economic and financial system.

====Société Générale insider trade====
In 1988, Soros was contacted by a French financier named Georges Pébereau, who asked him to participate in an effort to assemble a group of investors to purchase a large number of shares in [[Société Générale]], a leading French bank that was part of a privatization program (something instituted by the new government under [[Jacques Chirac]]).&lt;ref name=saltmarsh /&gt; Soros eventually decided against participating in the group effort, opting to personally move forward with his strategy of accumulating shares in four French companies: Société Générale, as well as Suez, Paribas, and the Compagnie Générale d'Électricité.

In 1989, the [[Autorité des marchés financiers (France)|Commission des Opérations de Bourse]] (COB, the French stock exchange regulatory authority) conducted an investigation of whether Soros's transaction in Société Générale should be considered [[insider trading]]. Soros had received no information from the Société Générale and had no insider knowledge of the business, but he did possess knowledge that a group of investors was planning a takeover attempt. Initial investigations found Soros innocent, and no charges were brought forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Heather|title=Soros Insider-Trading Conviction Reviewed by Human Rights Court|work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|date=October 4, 2011|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-10-04/soros-insider-trading-conviction-reviewed-by-human-rights-court.html|access-date=October 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the case was reopened a few years later, and the French Supreme Court confirmed the conviction on June 14, 2006,&lt;ref name="IHT20060614"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/14/business/worldbusiness/14iht-soros.1974397.html "Insider trading conviction of Soros is upheld"]. ''International Herald Tribune''. June 14, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; although it reduced the penalty to €940,000.&lt;ref name="IHT20060614" /&gt;

Soros denied any wrongdoing, saying news of the takeover was public knowledge&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/now/transcript/transcript_soros.html "David Brancaccio interviews George Soros"]. ''Now''. PBS. September 12, 2003. Retrieved February 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and it was documented that his intent to acquire shares of the company predated his own awareness of the takeover.&lt;ref name="IHT20060614" /&gt; In December 2006, he appealed to the [[European Court of Human Rights]] on various grounds, including that the 14-year delay in bringing the case to trial precluded a fair hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lichfield |first=John|title=Financier Soros fined £1.4m for insider trading|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/financier-soros-fined-acircpound14m-for-insider-trading-611646.html|access-date=October 12, 2011|newspaper=The Independent|location=London|date=December 22, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the basis of [[Article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 7]] of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], stating that no person may be punished for an act that was not a criminal offense at the time that it was committed, the court agreed to hear the appeal.&lt;ref name=saltmarsh&gt;{{cite news|last=Saltmarsh|first=Matthew|title=Soros to Get a Day in Court Over Insider Trading Case|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/16/business/global/16court.html|access-date=September 18, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2011, the court rejected his appeal in a 4–3 decision, saying that Soros had been aware of the risk of breaking insider trading laws.&lt;ref name="insider"&gt;{{cite news|author=Smith, Heather |title=Soros Loses Case Against French Insider-Trading Conviction|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/soros-loses-human-rights-appeal-against-insider-trading-case.html|access-date=October 9, 2011|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|date=October 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Soros has been married three times and divorced twice. In 1960, he married Annaliese Witschak (born January 3, 1934). Annaliese was an ethnic German immigrant, who had been orphaned during the war. Although she was not Jewish, she was well-liked by Soros's parents as she had also experienced the privation and displacement brought about by [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, Michael T., [https://books.google.com/books?id=UUncnapj_hIC&amp;pg=PT134&amp;lpg=PT134&amp;dq=annaliese+witschak+soros#v=onepage&amp;q=annaliese ''Soros: The Life and Times of a Messianic Billionaire''.]&lt;/ref&gt; They divorced in 1983.

== Political involvement ==
Soros was not a large donor to U.S. political causes until the 2004 presidential election, but according to the [[Center for Responsive Politics]], during the 2003–2004 election cycle, Soros donated $23,581,000 to various [[527 Group]]s (tax-exempt groups under the United States tax code, 26 U.S.C. § 527). The groups aimed to defeat President [[George W. Bush]]. After Bush's reelection, Soros and other donors backed a new political fundraising group called [[Democracy Alliance]], which supports progressive causes and the formation of a stronger progressive infrastructure in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/16/AR2006071600882_pf.html|title=New Alliance of Democrats Spreads Funding|work=The Washington Post|access-date=July 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2009, Soros donated $35&amp;nbsp;million to the state of New York to be earmarked for underprivileged children and given to parents who had benefit cards at the rate of $200 per child aged 3 through 17, with no limit as to the number of children that qualified. An additional $140&amp;nbsp;million was put into the fund by the state of New York from money they had received from the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|2009 federal recovery act]].&lt;ref name="NPR090409" /&gt;

Soros was an initial donor to the [[Center for American Progress]], and he continues to support the organization through the [[Open Society Foundations]].

In October 2011, a [[Reuters]] story, "Soros: Not a funder of [[Occupy Wall Street|Wall Street Protests]]," was published after several commentators pointed out errors in an earlier Reuters story headlined "Who's Behind the Wall St. Protests?" with a lede stating that the [[Occupy Wall Street]] movement "may have benefited indirectly from the largesse of one of the world's richest men [Soros]." Reuters's follow-up article also reported a Soros spokesman and [[Adbusters]]' co-founder [[Kalle Lasn]] both saying that Adbusters—the reputed catalyst for the first Occupy Wall Street protests—had never received any contributions from Soros, contrary to Reuters's earlier story that reported that "indirect financial links" existed between the two as late as 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Egan, Mark; Nichols, Michelle (October 13, 2011).

On September 27, 2012, Soros announced that he was donating $1&amp;nbsp;million to the super PAC backing [[Barack Obama|President Barack Obama]]'s reelection [[Priorities USA Action]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/27/soros-gives-1-million-to-democratic-super-pac/?smid=tw-nytimes|title=Soros Gives $1 Million to Democratic 'Super PAC{{'-}}|last=Confessore|first=Nicholas|date=September 27, 2012|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Waldemar A.

Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Soros' funding has continued to play an important role in the former Soviet sphere. His funding of pro-democratic programs in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] was considered by Georgian nationalists to be crucial to the success of the [[Rose Revolution]], although Soros has said that his role has been "greatly exaggerated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2005/5/31/164945.shtml |title=Soros Downplays Role in Georgia Revolution |date=June 1, 2005 |publisher=Archive.newsmax.com |access-date=October 16, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207024037/http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2005/5/31/164945.shtml |archivedate=February 7, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Lomaia]], Secretary of the Georgian Security Council and former Minister of Education and Science, is a former Executive Director of the Open Society Georgia Foundation ([[Soros Foundation]]), overseeing a staff of 50 and a budget of $2.5&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/document/49/0,2340,en_21571361_36507471_37001521_1_1_1_1,00.html |title=Alexander Lomaia – Minister of Education and Science (Georgia) |publisher=Oecd.org |access-date=October 16, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211061157/http://www.oecd.org/document/49/0%2C2340%2Cen_21571361_36507471_37001521_1_1_1_1%2C00.html |archivedate=February 11, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Georgian foreign minister [[Salomé Zourabichvili]] wrote that institutions like the Soros Foundation were the cradle of democratization and that all the NGOs that gravitated around the Soros Foundation undeniably carried the revolution. She opines that after the revolution the Soros Foundation and the NGOs were integrated into power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first= Salomé| last= Zourabichvili| work= Herodote| title= Article| publisher= French Institute for Geopolitics| date= April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Soros-backed pro-democracy initiatives have been banned in [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Turkmenistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first= Fred| last= Weir| url= http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0210/p01s03-wosc.html |title= Democracy rising in ex-Soviet states| work= [[The Christian Science Monitor]]| date= February 10, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ercis Kurtulus, head of the Social Transparency Movement Association (TSHD) in [[Turkey]], said in an interview that  "Soros carried out his will in Ukraine and Georgia by using these NGOs ...

According to ''The New York Times'', the Belarusian president [[Alexander Lukashenko]] has been widely criticized in the West and in Russia for his efforts to control the Belarus Soros Foundation and other independent NGOs and to suppress civil and human rights. Soros called the fines part of a campaign to "destroy independent society."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9400E0D91530F937A3575AC0A961958260|title=Soros Closes Foundation in Belarus|last=Miller|first=Judith|date=September 4, 1997|work=The New York Times|access-date=October 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2009, Soros donated $100&amp;nbsp;million to Central Europe and Eastern Europe to counter the impact of the [[Late-2000s recession|economic crisis]] on the poor, voluntary groups and non-government organisations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-321844.html Soros donates $100 million to Europe], [[Ukrainian Independent Information Agency]] (UNIAN), June 19, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2012 the Hungarian [[Third Orbán Government|Fidesz government]] gradually and strategically selected George Soros as [[enemy of the state]] for various reasons, with the focus on the deliberate misinterpretation of his humanitarian and political involvement in the [[European refugee crisis]]. The government has attacked [[Open Society Foundations|OSF]], the international civil support foundation created by George Soros, including various legal changes to revoke the permission of [[Central European University#Amendment to Act CCIV of 2011 on National Higher Education in the Hungarian Parliament (2017)|Central European University]] (Budapest) (which failed mostly due to significant public outrage&lt;ref name="istandwithceu"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.ceu.edu/category/istandwithceu | title=#IStartWithCeu | publisher=CEU | accessdate=April 18, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). In response Soros called the government "a mafia state".&lt;ref name="mafia"&gt;{{ cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/01/george-soros-attacks-hungarian-president-building-mafia-state | title=George Soros attacks Hungarian prime minister for building a 'mafia state' | date=June 1, 2017 | accessdate=April 18, 2018 | work=The Guardian | author=Jennifer Rankin }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the 2018 election period started the government introduced public posters with the photo of Soros,&lt;ref name="poster1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://img3.hvg.hu/image.aspx?id=4099562d-ee70-4221-bb53-c4952af5c15a&amp;view=da658e97-86c0-40f3-acd3-b0a850f32c30 | title=Soros large poster | author=Hungarian government | publisher=HVG }}&lt;/ref&gt; to create hostility in the general public towards him, using statements such as "Soros wants millions of migrants to live in Hungary", and "Soros wants to dismantle the [[Hungarian border barrier|border fence]]". The government also prepared a three-part law plan called "Stop Soros package" (which followed other various law changes&lt;ref name="Ktsztv"&gt;2017. évi LXXVI. törvény (LXXVI. law of 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; in the same year which hindered workings of several international NGOs in Hungary), which would include various steps against NGOs doing volunteer work related to the refugee crisis. Soros left most of these attacks without comments apart from a few short statements about the invalidity of the accusations.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In January 2017, the "Stop Operation Soros" (SOS) initiative was launched in Macedonia. SOS seeks to present "questions and answers about the way Soros operates worldwide" and invites citizens to contribute to the research.

Soros has funded worldwide efforts to promote [[drug policy reform]]. In 2008, Soros donated $400,000 to help fund a successful ballot measure in Massachusetts known as the [[Massachusetts Sensible Marijuana Policy Initiative]] which decriminalized possession of less than 1 oz (28g) of marijuana in the state.  Soros has also funded similar measures in California, Alaska, Oregon, Washington, Colorado, Nevada and Maine.&lt;ref&gt;LeBlanc, Steve, [http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hQsksgZ-IN6nYS3jJ2NcqpufBlLgD92QQPS00 Soros behind Mass. effort to decriminalize pot], Associated Press, August 27, 2008 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080831060134/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hQsksgZ-IN6nYS3jJ2NcqpufBlLgD92QQPS00|date=August 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the drug decriminalization groups that have received funding from Soros are the [[Lindesmith Center]] and [[Drug Policy Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://norml.org/index.cfm?Group_ID=4416 Norml.org], National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws&lt;/ref&gt; Soros donated $1.4&amp;nbsp;million to publicity efforts to support California's [[California Proposition 5 (2008)|Proposition 5]] in 2008, a failed ballot measure that would have expanded [[drug rehabilitation]] programs as alternatives to prison for persons convicted of non-violent drug-related offenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/la-me-billionaires1-2008nov01,0,3904554.story|title=Wealthy Californians put their agendas to a vote|last=Halper|first=Evan|date=November 1, 2008|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=October 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soros' philanthropy and support for progressive causes has made him the object of a large number of [[conspiracy theories]], most of them originating from the political [[Right-wing politics|right]].&lt;ref name="Atlantic_CSes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Soskis|first1=Benjamin|title=George Soros and the Demonization of Philanthropy|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/12/soros-philanthropy/547247/|accessdate=February 26, 2018|work=The Atlantic|date= December 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FT"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rachman|first1=Gideon|title=Soros hatred is a global sickness|url=https://www.ft.com/content/7f93856e-9c55-11e7-9a86-4d5a475ba4c5|accessdate=March 4, 2018|work=Financial Times|date= September 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Veronika Bondarenko, writing for ''[[Business Insider]]'' said that "For two decades, some have seen Soros as a kind of puppet master secretly controlling the global economy and politics."&lt;ref name="BusIns_CSes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bondarenko|first1=Veronika|title=George Soros is a favorite target of the right — here's how that happened|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-did-george-soros-become-the-favorite-boogeyman-of-the-right-2017-5|accessdate=March 3, 2018|work=[[Business Insider]]|date=May 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New York Times describes the allegations as moving "from the dark corners of the internet and talk radio" to "the very center of the political debate" by 2018.&lt;ref name=nyt-31-10-18&gt;{{cite news |last1=Shane |first1=Scott |last2=Vogel |first2=Kenneth P. |last3=Kingsley |first3=Patrick |title=How Vilification of George Soros Moved From the Fringes to the Mainstream |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/31/us/politics/george-soros-bombs-trump.html |accessdate=November 1, 2018 |agency=The New York Times |date=October 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soros has become a magnet for such theories, with opponents claiming that he is behind such diverse events as the [[2017 Women's March]], the fact-checking website [[Snopes]], the gun-control activism engaged in by the survivors of the [[Stoneman Douglas High School shooting]],&lt;ref name="NYT_CSes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rynbaum|first1=Michael M.|title=Right-Wing Media Uses Parkland Shooting as Conspiracy Fodder|url=https://mobile.nytimes.com/2018/02/20/business/media/parkland-shooting-media-conspiracy.html|accessdate=March 3, 2018|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vocativ_CSes"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Jennings|last2=Steinblatt|first2=Jacob|title=How George Soros Became The Right's Biggest Boogeyman|url=http://www.vocativ.com/412237/george-soros-right-boogeyman/|website=www.vocativ.com|publisher=[[Vocativ]]|accessdate=March 3, 2018|date=March 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT_Snopes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Streitfeld|first1=David|title=For Fact Checking Website Snopes, a Bigger Role Brings More Attacks|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/25/technology/for-fact-checking-website-snopes-a-bigger-role-brings-more-attacks.html|accessdate=December 27, 2016|work=The New York Times|date=December 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the October 2018 immigrant caravan, and the protests against then-Supreme Court nominee [[Brett Kavanaugh]].&lt;ref name=nyt-31-10-18/&gt;&lt;ref name="wapo-5-10-18"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rizzo |first1=Salvador |title=No, George Soros isn’t paying Kavanaugh protesters |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/10/05/no-george-soros-isnt-paying-kavanaugh-protesters/? |accessdate=November 1, 2018 |agency=Washington Post |date=October 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservatives, meanwhile, picked up on the thread in the late 2000s, spearheaded by [[Fox News]]. [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] gave an almost ten-minute monologue on Soros in 2007, calling him an "extremist" and claiming he was "off-the-charts dangerous".&lt;ref name="Vocativ_CSes" /&gt; The [[Breitbart News]] website, according to the London ''[[The Times|Times]]'' journalist, [[David Aaronovitch]], in promoting East European nationalism, has regularly published articles blaming Soros for anything of which it disapproves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Aaronovitch|first=David|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/extremists-find-their-time-has-come-atlast-c8mj0t7t5|title=Extremists find their time has come at last|work=The Times|date=March 2, 2017|accessdate=May 3, 2018}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soros' opposition to [[Brexit]] (in the United Kingdom) led to a front page on the British Conservative supporting newspaper, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' in February 2018, which was accused of antisemitism for claiming he was involved in a supposed "secret plot" for the country's voters to reverse [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|their decision to leave the European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Finkelstein|first=Daniel|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/george-soros-and-the-roots-of-antisemitism-z63fhp6z6|title=George Soros and the roots of antisemitism|work=The Times|date=February 14, 2018|accessdate=May 3, 2018}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the ''Telegraph'' did not mention Soros is Jewish, his opposition to Britain leaving the [[European Union]] had been reported elsewhere in less conspiratorial terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Behr|first=Rafael|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/08/brexit-antisemitic-dog-whistle-daily-telegraph-george-soros|title=A secret plot to stop Brexit, or an antisemitic dog whistle?|work=The Guardian|date=February 8, 2018|accessdate=May 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen Pollard]], editor of ''[[The Jewish Chronicle]]'', said on [[Twitter]]: &lt;!-- Pollard uses capitals for "Exactly"; I have silently changed the way his emphasis is rendered. --&gt;"The point is that language matters so much and this is ''exactly'' the language being used by antisemites here and abroad".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fisher|first=Lucy|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/brexiteers-and-alt-right-unite-against-globalist-billionaire-george-soros-mrkwspwlz|title=Brexiteers and alt-right unite against 'globalist' billionaire George Soros|work=The Guardian|date=February 8, 2018|accessdate=May 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lusher|first=Adam|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/geore-soros-brexit-antisemitism-jew-conspiracy-theories-telegraph-story-plot-hungary-broke-bank-of-a8201651.html|title=George Soros: The billionaire investor who became the favourite target of conspiracy theories and antisemitic hatred|work=The Independent|date=February 8, 2018|accessdate=May 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being ousted from office in the wake of the [[Panama Papers]] scandal of 2016, Icelandic Prime Minister [[Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson]] accused Soros of having bankrolled a conspiracy to remove him from power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Segir Panama-skjölin runnin undan rifjum Soros|publisher=[[RÚV]]|url=http://www.ruv.is/frett/segir-panama-skjolin-runnin-undan-rifjum-soros|date=July 27, 2016|accessdate=September 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sigmundur Davíð segir Panamaskjölin hafa verið sérstakt "hit-job"|publisher=''[[Kjarninn]]''|url=https://kjarninn.is/frettir/2017-02-27-sigmundur-david-segir-panamaskjolin-hafa-verid-serstakt-hit-job/|date=February 27, 2017|accessdate=September 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later pointed out that Soros himself had also been implicated in the Panama Papers, casting doubt on the prime minister's theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kom Soros upp um sjálfan sig?|publisher=Kjarninn|url=https://kjarninn.is/skodun/2016-07-28-kom-soros-upp-um-sjalfan-sig/|date=July 26, 2016|accessdate=September 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soros has been accused by right-wing personalities such as [[Alex Jones]], [[Roseanne Barr]] and [[James Woods]] of having been a Nazi collaborator who turned in other Jews and stole their riches, despite his young age at the time and the fact that he, along with his family, had to hide from the Hungarian government during the German occupation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2018/05/30/unpacking-the-george-soros-was-a-jew-killing-nazi-conspiracy-theory-that-roseanne-barr-spreads/?|title=George Soros wasn't a Nazi, Roseanne Barr.

===Reflexivity, financial markets, and economic theory===
Soros's writings focus heavily on the concept of [[reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]], where the biases of individuals enter into market transactions, potentially changing the fundamentals of the economy. Soros argues that different principles apply in markets depending on whether they are in a "near to equilibrium" or a "far from equilibrium" state. He argues that, when markets are rising or falling rapidly, they are typically marked by disequilibrium rather than equilibrium, and that the conventional economic theory of the market (the '[[efficient market hypothesis]]') does not apply in these situations.  Soros has popularized the concepts of dynamic disequilibrium, static disequilibrium, and near-equilibrium conditions.&lt;ref name="A" /&gt; He has stated that his own financial success has been attributable to the edge accorded by his understanding of the action of the reflexive effect. Reflexivity is based on three main ideas:&lt;ref name="A" /&gt;

# Reflexivity is best observed under special conditions where investor bias grows and spreads throughout the investment arena. Examples of factors that may give rise to this bias include (a) equity leveraging or (b) the [[Trend following|trend-following]] habits of speculators.
# Reflexivity appears intermittently since it is most likely to be revealed under certain conditions; i.e., the character of the equilibrium process is best considered in terms of probabilities.
# Investors' observation of and participation in the capital markets may at times influence valuations and fundamental conditions or outcomes.

A recent example of reflexivity in modern financial markets is that of the debt and equity of housing markets.&lt;ref name="A" /&gt; Lenders began to make more money available to more people in the 1990s to buy houses.  More people bought houses with this larger amount of money, thus increasing the prices of these houses.  Lenders looked at their balance sheets which not only showed that they had made more loans, but that the collaterals backing the loans – the value of the houses – had gone up (because more money was chasing the same amount of housing, relatively).  Thus they lent out more money because their balance sheets looked good, and prices rose higher still.

This was further amplified by public policy. In the US, home loans were guaranteed by the Federal government. Many national governments saw home ownership as a positive outcome and so introduced grants for first-time home buyers and other financial subsidies, such as the exemption of a primary residence from capital gains taxation. These further encouraged house purchases, leading to further price rises and further relaxation of lending standards.

The concept of reflexivity attempts to explain why markets moving from one equilibrium state to another tend to overshoot or undershoot. Soros's theories were originally dismissed by economists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Solow|first=Robert|title=The Amateur|journal=The New Republic|date=February 8, 1999|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but have received more attention after the 2008 crash including becoming the focus of an issue of the ''[[Journal of Economic Methodology]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| editor-last= Hands| editor-first= D. Wade |title=Reflexivity and Economics: George Soros's Theory of Reflexivity and the Methodology of Economic Science|journal=Journal of Economic Methodology|volume=20|series=2013|issue=4|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1350178X.2013.859415#tabModule|doi=10.1080/1350178X.2013.859415|pages=309–329| year= 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of reflexivity provides an explanation of the theories of [[Complexity economics]], as developed at the [[Santa Fe Institute]], although Soros had not publicised his views at the time the discipline was originally developed there in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=W.

===Reflexivity in politics===
Although the primary manifestation of the reflexive process that Soros discusses is its effects in the financial markets, he has also explored its effects in politics. He has stated that whereas the greatest threats to the "[[Open Society]]" in the past were from Communism and Fascism (as discussed in ''[[The Open Society and its Enemies]]'' by his mentor [[Karl Popper]]), the largest current threat is from [[market fundamentalism]].

He has suggested that the contemporary domination of world politics and world trade by the United States is a reflexive phenomenon, insofar as the success of military and financial coercion feeds back to encourage increasingly intense applications of the same policies to the point where they will eventually become unsustainable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= The Bubble of American Supremacy: Correcting the Misuse of American Power| publisher= PublicAffairs| year= 2003 | isbn= 978-1-58648-217-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===View of problems in the free market system===
Soros argues that the current system of financial speculation undermines healthy economic development in many underdeveloped countries. He blames many of the world's problems on the failures inherent in what he characterizes as [[market fundamentalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url= |title=The Alchemy of Finance|last=Soros|first=George|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year= 2003| isbn= 978-0-471-44549-4 |page= 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soros claims to draw a distinction between being a participant in the market and working to change the rules that market participants must follow.

==== Market predictions ====
Soros's book ''The New Paradigm for Financial Markets'' (May 2008), described a "superbubble" that had built up over the past 25 years and was ready to collapse. This was the third in a series of books he has written that have predicted disaster. As he states:

{{quote|I have a record of crying wolf ... I did it first in ''The [[Alchemy]] of Finance'' (in 1987), then in ''The Crisis of Global Capitalism'' (in 1998), and now in this book. So it's three books predicting disaster. [After] the boy cried wolf three times ... the wolf really came.&lt;ref name="predict"&gt;"[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121400427331093457 Soros, the Man Who Cries Wolf], Now Is Warning of a 'Superbubble'" by Greg Ip, B1, June 21–22, 2008 ''The Wall Street Journal''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He ascribes his own success to being able to recognize when his predictions are wrong.

{{quote|I'm only rich because I know when I'm wrong ... I basically have survived by recognizing my mistakes. I very often used to get backaches due to the fact that I was wrong. Whenever you are wrong you have to fight or [take] flight.  When [I] make the decision, the backache goes away.&lt;ref name="predict" /&gt;}}

In February 2009, Soros said the world financial system had in effect disintegrated, adding that there was no prospect of a near-term resolution to the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSTRE51K0A920090221 Soros sees no bottom for world financial "collapse"], ''[[Reuters]]'', February 21, 2009, Retrieved August 17, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; "We witnessed the collapse of the financial system ... It was placed on life support, and it's still on life support. There's no sign that we are anywhere near a bottom."

In January 2016, at an economic forum in Sri Lanka, Soros predicted a [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|financial crisis akin to 2008]] based on the state of the global currency, stock and commodity markets as well as the sinking [[Chinese yuan]].

=== Views on antisemitism and Israel ===
When asked about what he thought about [[Israel]], in ''The New Yorker'', Soros replied: "I don't deny the Jews to a right to a national existence – but I don't want anything to do with it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Buying a Better World: George Soros and Billionaire Philanthropy |first=Anna |last=Porter |location= |publisher=Dundurn Press |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-45973-103-5 |page=32 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8FusBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA32 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to hacked emails released in 2016, Soros's Open Society Foundation has a self-described objective of "challenging Israel's racist and anti-democratic policies" in international forums, in part by questioning Israel's reputation as a democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hacked Soros e-mails reveal plans to fight Israel's 'racist' policies|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Politics-And-Diplomacy/Hacked-Soros-e-mails-reveal-plans-to-fight-Israels-racist-policies-464149|access-date=November 7, 2016}}, [[The Jerusalem Post]], from [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]]&lt;/ref&gt; He has funded NGOs which have been actively critical of Israeli policies&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Soros Hack Reveals Evidence of Systemic Anti-Israel Bias |url=http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/210826/soros-hack-reveals-evidence-of-systemic-anti-israel-bias |first=Liel |last=Leibovitz |date=August 14, 2016 |work=[[Tablet (magazine)|Tablet]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishpress.com/news/breaking-news/dc-leaks-publishes-george-soros-files-showing-millions-contributed-to-anti-israel-causes/2016/08/14/ |title=DC Leaks Publishes George Soros' Files Showing Millions Contributed to Anti-Israel Causes |work=Jewish Press |first=David |last=Israel |date=August 14, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-08-16/how-george-soros-threatens-to-make-israel-a-pariah A Soros Plan, a Marginalized Israel] By Eli Lake, August 16, 2016, Bloomberg&lt;/ref&gt; including groups that campaign for the [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]] movement against Israel.&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt;

Speaking before a 2003 conference of the Jewish Funders Network, Soros said that the administrations of [[G.W. Bush]] in the U.S. and [[Ariel Sharon]] in Israel, and even the unintended consequences of some of his own actions, were partially contributing to a new European antisemitism.  Soros, citing accusations that he was one of the "Jewish financiers" who, in antisemitic terms, "ruled the world by proxy", suggested that if we change the direction of those policies, then anti-Semitism also will diminish. [[Abraham Foxman]] later said that Soros's comments held a simplistic view, were counterproductive, biased and a bigoted perception of what's out there, and "blamed the victim" when holding Jews responsible for [[antisemitism]].  Jewish philanthropist [[Michael Steinhardt]], who arranged for Soros's appearance at the conference, clarified, "George Soros does not think Jews should be hated any more than they deserve to be."&lt;ref name="Heilman_JTA"&gt;{{cite news |title=Soros Says Jews And Israel Cause Anti-Semitism |first=Uriel |last=Heilman |work=Jewish Telegraphic Agency |date=November 8, 2003 |url=http://www.jta.org/page_view_story.asp?intarticleid=13428&amp;intcategoryid=4 |archivedate=November 19, 2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031119203952/http://www.jta.org/page_view_story.asp?intarticleid=13428&amp;intcategoryid=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Soros has also said that Jews can overcome antisemitism by "giv[ing] up on the tribalness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Congress and the Shaping of the Middle East |first=Kirk |last=Beattie |location=New York |publisher=Seven Stories Press |year=2016 |isbn=978-1-60980-562-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a subsequent article for ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', Soros emphasized that

&lt;blockquote&gt;I do not subscribe to the myths propagated by enemies of Israel and I am not blaming Jews for anti-Semitism. Anti-Semitism predates the birth of Israel. Neither Israel's policies nor the critics of those policies should be held responsible for anti-Semitism. At the same time, I do believe that attitudes toward Israel are influenced by Israel's policies, and attitudes toward the Jewish community are influenced by the pro-Israel lobby's success in suppressing divergent views.&lt;ref&gt;Soros, George.

In 2017, Israeli billionaire businessman [[Beny Steinmetz]] filed a $10 million lawsuit against Soros, alleging that Soros had influenced the [[government of Guinea]] to freeze Steinmetz's company BSG Resources out of iron ore mining contracts in the African country due to "long-standing animus toward the state of Israel."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/05/05/george-soros-battles-10b-lawsuit-familiar-charges-wielding-political-influence.html George Soros battles $10B lawsuit, familiar charges of wielding political influence] Fox News&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.courthousenews.com/mining-company-sues-george-soros-10-billion Mining Company Sues George Soros for $10 Billion]

During an award ceremony for [[Imre Kertész]], Soros said that the victims of violence and abuse were becoming "perpetrators of violence," suggesting that this model explained Israel's behavior towards the Palestinians, which led to walkouts and Soros being booed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forward.com/the-assimilator/338433/the-night-george-soros-stood-in-for-nobelist-holocaust-survivor-imre-kertes The Night George Soros Stood In For Nobelist Holocaust Survivor Imre Kertesz] April 12, 2016, The Forward, By Masha Leon&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017, the Israeli ambassador in Hungary joined Jewish groups and others in denouncing a billboard campaign backed by Hungarian Prime Minister [[Viktor Orbán]], in which Soros was vilified as an "enemy of the state". The campaign was widely seen as anti-semitic, with critics claiming it "evokes memories of the Nazi posters during the Second World War". The ambassador stated that the campaign "evokes sad memories but also sows hatred and fear", an apparent reference to the Holocaust. Hungary's [[right-wing]] government had frequently attacked Soros, particularly for his support for more open immigration. Hours later, in an apparent attempt to ally Israel with Hungary, Israel's [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] issued a "clarification", denouncing Soros, stating that he "continuously undermines Israel's democratically elected governments," and that Soros funded organizations "that defame the Jewish state and seek to deny it the right to defend itself". The Israeli government has sought to ally itself with countries within the EU that might defend it from criticism; the clarification came a few days before an official visit to Hungary by Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-hungary-soros-idUSKBN19V1J4 Israel backs Hungary, says financier Soros is a threat] By Luke Baker, July 10, 2017, Reuters&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on the U.S.===
On November 11, 2003, in an interview with ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Soros said that removing President George W. Bush from office was the "central focus of my life" and "a matter of life and death." He said he would sacrifice his entire fortune to defeat Bush "if someone guaranteed it."&lt;ref name="deeppockets"&gt;Laura Blumenfeld, [http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2003-11-23/news/0311220187_1_george-soros-oust-bush-democratic-party Deep Pockets vs. Bush, Financier Contributes $5 Million More in Effort to Oust President], ''The Washington Post'', November 11, 2003; p.

His 2003 book, ''The Bubble of American Supremacy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Bubble of American Supremacy|last=Soros|first=George|publisher=Crows Nest M.S.W. Allen &amp; Unwin|year=2004|isbn=9781586482176|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;'', was a forthright critique of the Bush administration's "War on Terror" as misconceived and counterproductive, and a polemic against the re-election of Bush. He explains the title in the closing chapter by pointing out the parallels in this political context with the self-reinforcing reflexive processes that generate bubbles in stock prices.

When Soros was asked in 2006 about his statement in ''The Age of Fallibility'' that "the main obstacle to a stable and just world order is the United States," he responded that "it happens to coincide with the prevailing opinion in the world. And I think that's rather shocking for Americans to hear. The United States sets the agenda for the world. And the rest of the world has to respond to that agenda. By declaring a 'war on terror' after September 11, we set the wrong agenda for the world ... When you wage war, you inevitably create innocent victims."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/2006/06/27/america-the-dangerous.html "America the Dangerous?"], ''Newsweek'', June 27, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soros described [[Donald Trump]] as a con man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-19/george-soros-says-markets-will-falter-as-uncertainty-takes-over|title=Soros Says Markets to Slump With Trump, EU Faces Disintegration|date=January 19, 2017|publisher=|via=www.bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Soros expects Trump to fail because Soros believes Trump's ideas are self-contradictory.  Soros believes Trump is preparing for a [[trade war]] and expects financial markets to do badly.&lt;ref name="Guardian20/01/2017" /&gt;

===Views on Europe===
In October 2011, Soros drafted an open letter entitled "As concerned Europeans we urge Eurozone leaders to unite,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url = http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/7d85abd2-f353-11e0-b11b-00144feab49a.html#axzz1aYVAViDt |title=As concerned Europeans we urge Eurozone leaders to unite|author= George Soros |publisher=[[Financial Times]] |date = October 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he calls for a stronger economic government for Europe using federal means (Common EU treasury, common fiscal supervision, etc.) and warns against the danger of nationalistic solutions to the economic crisis. The letter was co-signed by [[Javier Solana]], [[Daniel Cohn-Bendit]], [[Andrew Duff]], [[Emma Bonino]], [[Massimo d'Alema]], [[Vaira Vike-Freiberga]].

Soros criticized Hungarian Prime Minister [[Viktor Orbán]] and his handling of the [[European migrant crisis]] in 2015: "His plan treats the protection of national borders as the objective and the refugees as an obstacle. Our plan treats the protection of refugees as the objective and national borders as the obstacle."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-30/orban-accuses-soros-of-stoking-refugee-wave-to-weaken-europe Orban Accuses Soros of Stoking Refugee Wave to Weaken Europe]".

In 2018, Soros has highlighted that Europe faces major challenges, in particular, that related to immigration, austerity, and nations leaving the political block.&lt;ref name="nytimes02018-05-29"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/29/business/dealbook/starbucks-bias-race.html|title=George Soros's Plan to Fix Europe: DealBook Briefing|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 29, 2018|accessdate=May 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He holds that Europe is facing an existential crisis, in view of the rise of populism, the refugee crisis and a growing rift between Europe and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-usa-economy/soros-warns-us-europe-alliance-destruction-may-cause-major-crisis-idUSKCN1IU1PX|title=Soros warns US-Europe alliance 'destruction' may cause major crisis|newspaper=Reuters|date=May 29, 2018|accessdate=May 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soros has also stated that "the euro has many unresolved problems" which "must not be allowed to destroy the European Union". He advocated replacing the notion of a multi-speed Europe by the aim of a "multi-track Europe" that would allow member states a wider variety of choices.&lt;ref name="ecfr-2018-05-29"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecfr.eu/article/commentary_how_to_save_europe|title=How to save Europe.

===Views on relations between Europe and Africa===
In view of the possibility of a further increase of the number of refugees from Africa to Europe, Soros proposes that the European Union devise a ''Marshall Plan for Africa'' (see ''[[Marshall Plan]]''), fostering education and employment in Africa in order to reduce emigration.&lt;ref name="nytimes02018-05-29"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ecfr-2018-05-29"/&gt;

===Views on Asia===
Soros has expressed concern about the growth of Chinese economic and political power, saying, "China has risen very rapidly by looking out for its own interests ... They have now got to accept responsibility for world order and the interests of other people as well."  Regarding the political gridlock in America, he said, "Today, China has not only a more vigorous economy but actually a better functioning government than the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2010/11/16/soros_china_has_better_functioning_government_than_us|title=Soros: China has better functioning government than U.S.|work=Foreign Policy|access-date=July 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2015, Soros stated that a "strategic partnership between the US and China could prevent the evolution of two power blocks that may be drawn into military conflict."&lt;ref name="nybookschina"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2015/07/09/partnership-china-avoid-world-war/ |title=A Partnership with China to Avoid World War |last1=Soros |first1=George |date=July 9, 2015 |journal=The New York Review of Books |access-date=January 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 2016, during an interview at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Soros stated that "[a] hard landing is practically unavoidable."

===Views on Russia and Ukraine===
In May 2014, Soros told CNN's [[Fareed Zakaria]]: "I set up a foundation in Ukraine before Ukraine became independent from Russia. And the foundation has been functioning ever since and played an important part in events now."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1405/25/fzgps.01.html Interview with George Soros]". [[CNN]]. May 25, 2014,&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, Soros said that "Europe needs to wake up and recognize that it is under attack from Russia." He also urged Western countries to expand economic [[International sanctions during the 2013–15 Ukrainian crisis|sanctions against Russia]] for its support of separatists in eastern Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2015/feb/05/new-policy-rescue-ukraine/?insrc=hpss A New Policy to Rescue Ukraine]". ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''. February 5, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, Soros called on the European Union to give $50&amp;nbsp;billion of bailout money to Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://business.financialpost.com/2015/01/08/george-soros-warns-europe-under-russian-attack-urges-ukraine-bailout/ George Soros warns Europe under Russian 'attack', urges Ukraine bailout]". ''[[Financial Post]]''. January 8, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, Soros stated that [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|Putin's annexation of Crimea]] was a challenge to the "prevailing world order," specifically the European Union. He hypothesized that Putin wants to "destabilize all of Ukraine by precipitating a financial and political collapse for which he can disclaim responsibility, while avoiding occupation of a part of eastern Ukraine, which would then depend on Russia for economic support."&lt;ref name="nybookschina" /&gt; In November 2015, Russia banned the Open Society Foundations (OSF) and the Open Society Institute (OSI)-- two pro-democracy charities founded by Soros—stating they posed a "threat to the foundations of the constitutional system of the Russian Federation and the security of the state."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2015/11/30/russia-bans-george-soros-charity-as-security-threat.html |title=Russia bans George Soros charity as 'security threat' |last1=Makortoff |first1=Kalyeena |date=November 20, 2015 |website=cnbc.com |publisher=CNBC LLC |access-date=January 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fortune.com/2015/11/30/russia-bans-george-soros-foundation-as-state-security-threat/ |title=Russia Bans George Soros Foundation as State Security 'Threat' |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=November 30, 2015 |website=fortune.com |publisher=Fortune |access-date=January 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2016, 53 books related to Soros's "Renewal of Humanitarian Education" program were withdrawn at the Vorkuta Mining and Economic College in the [[Komi Republic]], with 427 additional books seized for shredding.

Soros has been active as a philanthropist since the 1970s, when he began providing funds to help [[Black African|black]] students attend the [[University of Cape Town]] in [[apartheid]] South Africa,&lt;ref name="GSb" /&gt; and began funding dissident movements behind the [[Iron Curtain]].

Soros's philanthropic funding includes efforts to promote non-violent [[democratization]] in the [[post-Soviet states]]. These efforts, mostly in [[Central Europe|Central]] and Eastern Europe, occur primarily through the [[Open Society Foundations]] (originally Open Society Institute or OSI) and national Soros Foundations, which sometimes go under other names (such as the [[Stefan Batory Foundation]] in Poland). As of 2003, [[PBS]] estimated that he had given away a total of $4&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name="PBS" /&gt; The OSI says it has spent about $500&amp;nbsp;million annually in recent years.

In 2003, former [[Federal Reserve]] chairman [[Paul Volcker]] wrote in the foreword of Soros's book ''The Alchemy of Finance'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;George Soros has made his mark as an enormously successful speculator, wise enough to largely withdraw when still way ahead of the game. The bulk of his enormous winnings is now devoted to encouraging transitional and emerging nations to become "open societies," open not only in the sense of freedom of commerce but—more important—tolerant of new ideas and different modes of thinking and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qxkiYul2wgoC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PR12#v=onepage|title=The Alchemy of Finance|last=Soros|first=George|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year= 2003| isbn= 978-0-471-44549-4|page=xii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Time'' magazine in 2007 cited two specific projects—$100&amp;nbsp;million toward Internet infrastructure for regional [[List of institutions of higher learning in Russia|Russian universities]], and $50&amp;nbsp;million for the [[Millennium Promise]] to eradicate extreme poverty in Africa—noting that Soros had given $742&amp;nbsp;million to projects in the U.S., and given away a total of more than $7&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://georgesoros.com/faqs/entry/georgesorosphilanthropyisunprecedented/ Philanthrophy]{{failed verification|date=December 2014}}{{unreliable source?|date=December 2014}} {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100921163744/http://georgesoros.com/faqs/entry/georgesorosphilanthropyisunprecedented/|date=September 21, 2010}}.

Other notable projects have included aid to scientists and universities throughout central and eastern Europe, help to civilians during the [[siege of Sarajevo]], and [[Transparency International]]. Soros also pledged an endowment of €420&amp;nbsp;million to the [[Central European University]] (CEU). The [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner [[Muhammad Yunus]] and his [[microfinance]] bank [[Grameen Bank]] received support from the OSI.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

According to ''[[National Review Online]]''&lt;ref&gt;York, Byron, [http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/213708/soros-funded-stewart-defense/byron-york Soros Funded Stewart Defense], ''National Review Online''; retrieved February 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; the Open Society Institute gave $20,000 in September 2002 to the Defense Committee of [[Lynne Stewart]], the lawyer who has defended controversial, poor, and often unpopular defendants in court and was sentenced to 2{{sfrac|1|3}} years in prison for "providing material support for a terrorist conspiracy" via a press conference for a client.

In September 2006, Soros pledged $50&amp;nbsp;million to the Millennium Promise, led by economist [[Jeffrey Sachs]] to provide educational, agricultural, and medical aid to help villages in Africa enduring poverty. ''[[The New York Times]]'' termed this endeavor a "departure" for Soros whose philanthropic focus had been on fostering democracy and good government, but Soros noted that most poverty resulted from bad governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://travel2.nytimes.com/2006/09/13/us/13soros.html |title=Philanthropist Gives $50 Million to Help Aid the Poor in Africa |last=Dugger |first=Celia W. |date=September 13, 2006 |work=The New York Times |location=Africa |access-date=October 16, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090409170818/http://travel2.nytimes.com/2006/09/13/us/13soros.html |archivedate=April 9, 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BoiseIdahoGOTV2012.jpg|thumb|Typical [[canvassing]] material for GOTV in the U.S.]]
{{Political campaigning}}

"'''Get out the vote'''" (or "'''getting out the vote'''"; '''GOTV''') describes efforts aimed at increasing the [[voter turnout]] in elections. In countries that do not have or enforce [[compulsory voting]], voter turnout can be low, sometimes even below a third of the eligible voter pool. GOTV is generally not required for elections when there are effective compulsory voting systems in place, other than perhaps to register first time voters.

There may be two types of political campaigns. The first is [[voter registration campaign]]s by electoral authorities or nonpartisan organizations that attempt to motivate potential voters to register and to vote. The second type is efforts made by political parties or politicians targeted at registered voters who are expected to vote in their favor. Campaigns typically attempt to register voters, then get them to vote, either by absentee ballot, early voting or election day voting.

== Campaign contexts ==
In contexts of the efforts of candidates, party activities and ballot measure campaigns, "get-out-the-vote" or "GOTV" is an adjective indicating having the effect of increasing the number of the campaign's ''supporters'' who will vote in the immediately approaching election.

Typically GOTV is a distinct phase of the overall campaign. Tactics used during GOTV often include: telephoning or sending [[personalized audio messages]] to known supporters on the days leading up to an election (or on election day itself), providing transport to and from polling stations for supporters, and canvassing known supporters. [[Canvassing]] for the purpose of [[voter registration]] usually ceases when GOTV begins. Other activities include literature drops early on election day or the evening before and an active tracking of eligible voters who have already voted.

The importance of get out the vote efforts increases as the total percentage of the population voting decreases.  For instance, with only two-thirds of the population voting in a Canadian election it is often easier and more cost effective to ensure that a hundred supporters show up on polling day than it is to convince a hundred voters to switch support from one party to the other. This situation often leads to polarized electoral politics. A 90% turnout from a party's radical base is often better than a 50 percent turnout from both radical and moderate supporters.

GOTV can also be important in high turn-out elections when the margin of victory is expected to be close.

== Voter turnout organizations ==
In many countries, the task of [[Election commission|electoral authorities]] includes the promotion of and assisting in the registration of potential voters, and in the exercise of the right to vote. However, such efforts are not uniformly successful, and at times are partisan.

A number of [[nonpartisan]] voter turnout organizations have formed in an effort to "get out the vote". In the United States, such voter turnout organizations include the [[League of Women Voters]], [[Rock the Vote]], [[The Voter Participation Center]] and [[Vote.org]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Last updated June 23, 2010 Share &amp;nbsp;Email Print |url=http://www.longdistancevoter.org |title=Absentee Voting Made Easy |publisher=LongDistanceVoter.org |date=2010-06-23 |accessdate=2010-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; which attempt to motivate potential voters to register and to vote in the belief that failure of any eligible voter to vote in any election is a loss to society.

The effort of these organizations is in getting people to vote and not to promote particular candidates or political view, and a group is nonpartisan if it is not directing people how to vote. Nonpartisan groups generally do not distribute literature about candidates or causes when assisting potential voters to register to vote, and also do not focus GOTV efforts on voters who are most likely to agree with their personal views.

== Reading system ==

The traditional GOTV method used in the UK is the Reading system, developed by the [[Reading (UK Parliament constituency)|Reading Constituency]] [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and its [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[Ian Mikardo]] for the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 general election]].&lt;ref&gt;How to Win an Election, Paul Richards, Second Edition, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; Once [[canvassing]] was performed to identify likely Labour voters, these were compiled onto 'Reading pads' or 'Mikardo sheets' featuring the names and addresses of supporters and pasted onto a large table or plank of wood. On election day these lists, with identical copies underneath, were torn off and given to GOTV campaigners. Lists of this type are sometimes referred to as [[Shuttleworth (canvassing)|Shuttleworths]].

At each polling station, tellers for each party will collect the unique poll numbers of voters from their polling cards. These numbers are regularly collected from the polling stations and collated in a campaign headquarters for each ward, often referred to in the UK as a committee room. 'Promised voters' who have already voted are then crossed off the list of voters canvassed as supporting Labour. This enables campaigners to then focus more efficiently on the remainder of their supporters who have not voted. Computerisation has heralded further increases in efficiency, but nearly all subsequent methodologies can be traced back in some form to the Reading system.

== Negative campaigning and voter suppression ==
[[File:Robby Mook MD 2006 GOTV.jpg|thumb|[[Robby Mook]] get out the vote leaflet for the [[Maryland gubernatorial election, 2006|Maryland gubernatorial election]].]]

The terminology reflects a distinction of GOTV from the complementary strategy of suppressing turnout among likely opposition voters. [[Political consultant|Political]] [[consultant]]s are reputed to privately advise some candidates to "go [[Negative campaigning|negative]]" (attack an opponent), without any intent to sway voters toward them: this plan is to instead increase the number of eligible voters who ''fail to vote'', because their tendency to believe "politics is inherently [[Political corruption|corrupt]]" has so recently been reinforced. Such turnout suppression can be advantageous where any combination of three conditions apply:
# The negative campaigning is targeted (by direct mail, telephone "[[push poll]]s," or the like) on likely opposing voters, reducing the collateral damage to supporters' morale.
# The side going negative has an advantage in its supporters being steadier voters than those of its opponent.
# The side going negative has an advantage in doing effective GOTV, so that its campaign workers can get a GOTV "antidote" to more supporters "poisoned" by the negative campaign, than the opposing campaign can of their own supporters.



==Vote by mail==
Face to face GOTV has been found to be less effective with [[Vote by mail]] balloting.

== Get out the vote in practice ==
[[File:GOTV.png|thumb|Methods of raising turnout.]]

Political scientists have conducted hundreds of [[field experiments]] to learn which get out the vote tactics are effective, when, and on which types of voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Get Out the Vote! |url=http://gotv.research.yale.edu/ |website=Yale University |accessdate=24 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018102110/http://gotv.research.yale.edu/ |archivedate=18 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This research has revolutionized how campaigns conceive of their get out the vote efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bump|first1=Philip|title=Will Democrats’ ground game save their Senate majority?

The value of GOTV is unclear, but a well-organized effort can gain a candidate as much as nine percentage points in campaigns in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nickerson |first1=David W. |last2=Rogers |first2=Todd |date=2010 |title=Do You Have a Voting Plan? : Implementation Intentions, Voter Turnout, and Organic Plan Making |url= https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/todd_rogers/files/do_you_have_a_voting_plan_0.pdf|location= |publisher=Sage Publications|page=2 |isbn= |accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of mobilization, studies have found that door-to-door canvassing increases turnout among the contacted households with approximately 4.3 percentage points, according to experts Alan Gerber and Gregory Huber in 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Getting Out the Vote Is Tougher Than You Think.|url = https://ssir.org/increasing_voter_turnout/entry/getting_out_the_vote_is_tougher_than_you_think|journal = Stanford Social Innovation Review|date = 2016|language = en|first = Alan|last = Gerber|first2 = Gregory A.|last2 = Huber}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a 2013 study of 71 canvasses including many that targeted low propensity voters found turnout increased by 2–3 percentage points.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Field experiments and the study of voter turnout.|url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17457289.2012.728223|journal = Journal of Elections, Public Opinion and Parties|date = 2013|issn = 1745-7289|pages = 27–48|doi = 10.1080/17457289.2012.728223|language = en|first = Donald P.|last = Green|first2 = Mary C.|last2 = McGrath|first3 = Peter M.|last3 = Aronow}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even earlier, analysts had often concluded that personal canvassing produced far higher voter turnout rates, such as 9.8-12.8%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Effects of Canvassing, Telephone Calls, and Direct Mail on Voter Turnout: A Field Experiment.|jstor = 2585837|journal = The American Political Science Review|date = 2000|page = 660|language = en|first = Alan S.|last = Gerber|first2 = Donald P.|last2 = Green}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While most experiments have been conducted in the US, recent studies have found similar&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Door-to-door canvassing in the European elections: Evidence from a Swedish field experiment|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261379416302748|journal = Electoral Studies|date = 2017|issn = 0261-3794|pages = 110–118|doi = 10.1016/j.electstud.2016.12.002|language = en|first = Pär|last = Nyman}}&lt;/ref&gt; or somewhat smaller&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Is Door-to-Door Canvassing Effective in Europe?

The guide to grassroots elections ''Get Out the Vote'' determined that GOTV efforts averaged one vote every 15 door knocks by volunteers ($31 dollars per vote), 35 phone calls by volunteers ($35 dollars per vote), or 273 pieces of nonpartisan direct mail ($91 dollars per vote, no effect from partisan direct mail).&lt;ref name="green"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/books/9780815726852|title=Get out the vote: how to increasevoter turnout|last=Green|first=Donald P.|last2=Gerber|first2=Alan S.|date=2015-01-01|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|isbn=9780815726852|edition=Third|pages=97–98, 101, 120–121, 146, 158|location=Washington, D.C}}&lt;/ref&gt; They note that campaigns which experiment carefully can do better than these averages. Campaigns can raise turnout up to 8 percentage points with direct mail which tells neighbors when other neighbors have voted and promises to mail an update after the election, though people complain when they have no way to opt in or out of notification.&lt;ref name="gerber"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gerber |first=Alan S. |last2=Green |first2=Donald P. |last3=Larimer |first3=Christopher W. |date=2008-02-01 |title=Social Pressure and Voter Turnout: Evidence from a Large-Scale Field Experiment |url=https://isps.yale.edu/sites/default/files/publication/2012/12/ISPS08-001.pdf |journal=American Political Science Review |language=en |volume=102 |issue=1 |pages=33–48 |doi=10.1017/s000305540808009x |issn=1537-5943}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="green" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rogers"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Rogers |first=Todd |last2=Green |first2=Donald P. |last3=Ternovski |first3=John |last4=Young |first4=Carolina Ferrerosa |title=Social pressure and voting: A field experiment conducted in a high-salience election |url=https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/todd_rogers/files/social_pressure.pdf |journal=Electoral Studies |volume=46 |pages=87–100 |doi=10.1016/j.electstud.2017.02.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies have found that GOTV methods contribute little to none to voter turnout. One field experiment found that GOTV phone calls were largely ineffective, and that ease of access to polling locations had the largest impact on voter turnout.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=McNulty|first=John Edward|title=Sensitivities of voter turnout: field experiments exploring effects of a variety of treatments|date=2005-01-01|url=http://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url%20ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft%20val%20fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;res%20dat=xri:pqm&amp;rft%20dat=xri:pqdiss:3211443}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also the argument that GOTV targets a more affluent demographic, which is already more likely to vote. Less politically engaged demographic and socioeconomic groups are sometimes neglected in GOTV efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/berkeley/Doc?id=10602425|title=Mobilizing inclusion: redefining citizenship through get-out-the-vote campaigns|last=García Bedolla|first=Lisa|last2=Michelson|first2=Melissa R.|date=2012-01-01|publisher=Yale University Press|series=The Yale ISPS series|location=New Haven}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GOTV is often most effective when potential voters are told to do so "because others will ask"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://uclibs.org/PID/20782/w19832|title=Voting to tell others|last=Della Vigna|first=Stefano|date=2014-01-01|publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research|series=NBER working paper series|location=Cambridge, Mass}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voters will then go to the polls as a means of fulfilling perceived societal expectations. Paradoxically, informing voters that turnout is expecting to be high was found to increase actual voter turnout, while predicting lower turnouts actually resulted in less voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/research-backed-ways-get-out-vote|title=Research-Backed Ways to Get Out the Vote|newspaper=Stanford Graduate School of Business|access-date=2016-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 [[Rock the Vote]] paid to run TV ads aimed at young voters, on a random sample of small cable systems where they could measure the effects. Turnout was three percentage points higher among 18-19-year olds in these sample areas than in the control group covered by other similar small cable systems; there was less effect above age 22.&lt;ref name="vavreck"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Green |first=Donald P. |last2=Vavreck |first2=Lynn |date=2008 |title=Analysis of Cluster-Randomized Experiments: A Comparison of Alternative Estimation Approaches |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Donald_Green4/publication/31382310_Analysis_of_Cluster-Randomized_Experiments_A_Comparison_of_Alternative_Estimation_Approaches/links/00b4951f9a12acc282000000.pdf |journal=Political Analysis |language=en |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=138–152 |doi=10.1093/pan/mpm025 |issn=1047-1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="green" /&gt;

In November 2012 and 2013 Rock the Vote experimented with Facebook ads to encourage voter turnout by telling people the number of days remaining until the election and which of their friends "liked" the countdown. The ads were shown to over 400,000 adults, randomly selected from a base over 800,000. Rock the Vote had helped many of them register. The ads did not increase turnout in the experimental group, compared to the control group who did not get the ads.&lt;ref name="green" /&gt; In 2012 they also experimented with text message reminders to 180,000 people who had provided their mobile numbers. Texts the day before the election raised turnout six tenths of a percentage point, while texts on election day lowered turnout.&lt;ref name="green" /&gt;

Several [[mobile apps]] tell people where to vote, identify their elected officials, or search candidates' positions, though no evidence measures how much these raise turnout.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/13/opinion/increasing-voter-turnout-2018.html |title=Opinion: Increasing Voter Turnout for 2018 and Beyond |last=Rosenberg |first=Tina |date=2017-06-13 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2018-03-25 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook apps let users see who their friends endorse, which gives them a shortcut in deciding whom to vote for.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.govtech.com/applications/University-at-Albany-Researchers-Create-App-to-Increase-Voter-Turnout.html |title=University at Albany Researchers Create App to Increase Voter Turnout |last=CLARK |first=DARTUNORRO |date=2015-07-23 |work=Government Technology |access-date=2018-03-25 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Groundwater Ambient Monitoring and Assessment Program (GAMA)''' is an all-inclusive monitoring program for [[groundwater]] that was implemented in 2000 in [[California]], United States. It was created by the [[California State Water Resources Control Board]] as an improvement from groundwater programs that were already in place. GAMA monitors various aspects in groundwater such as the [[water quality]] and allotment total through research projects conducted by multiple agencies both statewide and locally sourced.  GAMA wants to improve public awareness for groundwater resources as well as improve monitoring on groundwater research across the state to assess potential hazards from this resource.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/gama/about.shtml|title=State Water Resources Control Board|last=California|first=State of|website=www.waterboards.ca.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== California groundwater ==
Approximately 85% of water used in California by farmers and residents today is from groundwater, with 6 million Californians relying solely on this resource.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://waterinthewest.stanford.edu/groundwater/overview/index.html|title=Understanding California’s Groundwater {{!}} Water in the West|website=waterinthewest.stanford.edu|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Central Valley (California)|The Central Valley]] is a big user of groundwater for agricultural purposes which supplies a large portion of food for not only California, but for the rest of the United States as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ppic.org/publication/groundwater-in-california/|title=Groundwater in California - Public Policy Institute of California|work=Public Policy Institute of California|access-date=2018-04-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resource for a long time had been unregulated which helps us understand the groundwater crisis that occurs today in California. This was a highly relied upon resource over the past century, and was especially critical during [[Droughts in California|drought periods]]. When there was less [[Snowpack|snow pack]] and less precipitation, people relied heavily on groundwater.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Over time, issues have arose like land subsidence which occurs from pumping groundwater out faster than it can naturally replenish underground.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/910237645|title=Sustainable water : challenges and solutions from California|others=Lassiter, Allison, 1980-|isbn=9780520285354|edition= First |location=Oakland, California|oclc=910237645}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is one reason among many others for why GAMA was proposed.

== Research projects ==
[[File:Aquifer en.svg|left|thumb|250x250px|Unconfined aquifer referring to a shallow aquifer. Confined aquifer referring to a deep aquifer.]]Since GAMA has been implemented, there have been a few projects that GAMA aims to achieve to better understand California's groundwater systems.

=== Priority Basin Project  ===
Begun in 2002 to help better understand risks imposed on California groundwater, this project looks at both deep and shallow [[aquifer]]s. Deep groundwater for this project looks at how this water is used for the public use. Shallow aquifers address more local water uses such as [[Water well|wells]]. By tracking both of these aquifers, officials hope to be able to better understand impacts on groundwater, to provide more information to consumers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== GeoTracker GAMA ===
This is a system that integrates reported data from all of Californias groundwater systems from both the Priority Basin Project and the Domestic Well Project. This information goes through analytical processes to later be uploaded onto a comprehensive statewide map. This monitoring method allows all agencies access to a comprehensive site where data is available for users to see if there is a potential contaminant that is above safety levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://geotracker.waterboards.ca.gov/gama/|title=GeoTracker|last=California|first=State of|website=geotracker.waterboards.ca.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Domestic Well Project ===
This project took samples from domestic wells and analyzed the water quality for commonly occurring chemicals. This gave well owners information regarding the quality of their water, which also acted as a baseline for other wells in the area. This information was entered into the GeoTracker GAMA project data. There has been a main focus on six counties which include [[Tehama County, California|Tehama]], [[Monterey County, California|Monterey]], [[Yuba County, California|Yuba]], [[El Dorado County, California|El Dorado]], [[Tulare County, California|Tulare]], and [[San Diego County, California|San Diego]] counties. Over one thousand wells collectively between all counties have been sampled so far.  Chemicals tested include [[Nitrate]]s, [[Perchlorate]], [[Sulfate]], [[Chloride]], [[Coliform bacteria|Coliform]], [[Volatile organic compound|Volatile Organic Compounds]], [[Aluminium|Aluminum]], [[Arsenic]], [[Cadmium]], [[Chromium]], [[Iron]], [[Lead]], [[Manganese]], [[Thallium]], [[Vanadium]], [[Zinc]], [[Radium]], and [[Uranium]]. Most owners received information by pamphlets sent by mail regarding the water quality of their well.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Legislation ==
GAMA was built on current legislation which consists of six bills and one proposition.

=== AB 599: Groundwater Quality Monitoring Act  ===
Took affect in 2001 shortly after GAMA was implemented. Legislature stated that it's a necessity that groundwater should continue to be monitored to make sure the groundwater system is safe. More information to the public needs to be improved upon, and more information needs to be conducted to better understand how to restore depleted groundwater systems. A comprehensive program among agencies would need to be implemented across the state to ensure adequate monitoring measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=200120020AB599|title=Bill Text  - AB-599 Groundwater contamination:  quality monitoring program.|website=leginfo.legislature.ca.gov|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:California State Capitol Building.jpg|thumb|313x313px|[[California State Capitol]]. California citizens vote prop 50 (Water Scarcity, Clean Drinking Water, Coastal and Beach Protection Act)]]

=== Prop 50: Water Scarcity, Clean Drinking Water, Coastal and Beach Protection Act ===
Passed in November 2002. This Act was granted approximately $380 million for IRWM plans and projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.northcoastresourcepartnership.org/app_pages/view/7920|title=IRWM: Propositions 50, 84 &amp; 1 : North Coast Resource Partnership|website=www.northcoastresourcepartnership.org|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voters approved this act which would help with a number of issues such as groundwater replenishment plans, improved water quality, and improved water security.

=== AB1747: Bond Law for Proposition 50 Projects ===
States that rules from Proposition 50 must be in line with AB 599.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== AB 2222: Groundwater Information Accessibility and Identification of Communities Reliant on Contaminated Groundwater ===
This bill states that the state board extend AB 599 funding to 2024. Public opinion would be able to make recommendations and state opinions before new legislation would be enacted.  Public accessibility would be improved upon as well regarding issues such as contaminated groundwater, and developing plans to assess the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=ftp://leginfo.public.ca.gov/pub/07-08/bill/asm/ab_2201-2250/ab_2222_bill_20080930_chaptered.html|title=Bill Number AB 2222|last=|first=|date=|website=leginfo.public.ca.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== SB X2 1: Nitrate Pilot Projects in Tulare Lake and Salinas Basins ===
Implemented in 2008 as a recovery program to understand why contamination can occur in groundwater and preventative measures. [[Tulare lake]] and [[Salinas, California|Salinas]] basin will serve as a research zones. Agencies will find point sources of nitrates in groundwater, and reduce nitrate levels or prevent them entirely. Costs and funding methods must be interpreted for these zones. Adding an interagency task force to monitor and expand cleanup programs will be a necessity, and reports must be generated including all research conducted from Tulare Lake and the Salinas Basin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://groundwaternitrate.ucdavis.edu/files/138409.pdf|title=Water Code Section 83002.5 was added by SBX2 1 Chaptered September 30, 2008|last=|first=|date=|website=UC Davis|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== SB1938: Monitoring Components for Groundwater Managing Plans ===
A local agency can come up with a new plan for groundwater management based on prior groundwater laws. SB 1938 declared that groundwater must be protected and adequately managed, especially during dry years where groundwater use increases. This bill continues to declare that groundwater systems are not well understood which complicates future planning, and that agencies need to communicate with each other to effectively manage a monitoring system fo this resource.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=200120020SB1938|title=Bill Text - SB-1938 Groundwater management:  state funding.|website=leginfo.legislature.ca.gov|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== SB 4: Oil and Gas: Well Stimulation ===
Implemented in 2013. Well Stimulation Treatments would need an all-inclusive program to monitor these actions. Part of this bill enacted research on well stimulation treatments which owners or well operators would be required to have recorded data on these sites. Permits would be required to perform any well stimulation treatments as well as frequent inspections. Fines will be issued if violations occur. This program must be implemented starting in July, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201320140SB4|title=Bill Text - SB-4  Oil and gas: well stimulation.|website=leginfo.legislature.ca.gov|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3386">The '''Hapu Party''' was a [[Māori people|Māori]] [[political party]] in [[New Zealand]] formed in August 2008.&lt;ref name="hplaunch"/&gt; The party's leader was [[Northland Region|Northland]] iwi leader David Rankin.&lt;ref name="hplaunch"&gt;{{cite web |title=New Maori Party to be launched |url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO0808/S00174.htm |date=2008-08-14 |accessdate=2008-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policies and actions==
The Hapu Party believed that because of poorer Māori health outcomes, and therefore reduced life expectancy, Māori should be eligible for the pension at age 56. It planned to introduce a flat rate 18% personal tax and GST rate. Finally it sought to introduce the allocation of [[Treaty of Waitangi]] settlement monies to [[hapū]] and [[marae]], and to allow treaty claims to be made over private land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hapu Party issues shock Treaty policy |url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO0809/S00435.htm |publisher=Scoop Media |date=2008-09-30 |accessdate=2008-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The Hapu party sought to stand candidates in all seven [[Māori electorates]] for the [[New Zealand general election, 2008|2008 election]].&lt;ref name="hplaunch"/&gt; It ran only a single candidate in 2008, receiving only 202 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Election Results -- Te Tai Tokerau |url=http://2008.electionresults.govt.nz/electorate-68.html |publisher=Chief Electoral Office |date=2008-11-08 |accessdate=2008-11-14 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090523174916/http://2008.electionresults.govt.nz/electorate-68.html |archivedate=2009-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It did not run any candidates in the [[New Zealand general election, 2011|2011 election]].

==Leadership==
The party's leader David Rankin, Matarahurahu hapū leader, became involved in a number of controversies including attempting to ban [[Māori Party]] MP [[Hone Harawira]] and his mother [[Titewhai Harawira]] from Waitangi Day commemorations in 2007.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10421941"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/waitangi-day/news/article.cfm?c_id=1500878&amp;objectid=10421941 |title=Hapu leader warns Harawiras to stay away from Waitangi |date=1 February 2007 |agency=[[NZPA]] |newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=2 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later he called for Harawira's resignation following Harawira's allegations of racism towards the Australian prime minister.&lt;ref name="TVNZ_1224419"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/content/1224419 |title=Backlash against Harawira outburst |date=10 July 2007 |work=[[Television New Zealand]] |accessdate=2 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rankin became involved in the question of authenticity surrounding the auction of a piece of the famous [[Kororareka]] flagpole cut down in [[Russell, New Zealand|Russel]] in 1844 as an act of defiance against British authority, by his great great uncle [[Hone Heke]].&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10564268"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10564268 |title=Flagpole auction raises history question |author=Tahana, Yvonne |date=30 March 2009 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=2 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25590">[[Niue]] is a country in the South Pacific Ocean with an estimated population of 1,190.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CIA World Factbook: Niue|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ne.html|accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1974, it has been self-governing in [[Associated state|free association]] with New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;ss 3-8 Niue Constitution Act 1974&lt;/ref&gt; Niue controls its own internal affairs, while New Zealand retains responsibility for its defence and external relations&lt;ref&gt;s 3 Niue Constitution Act 1974&lt;/ref&gt; and is required to provide necessary economic and administrative assistance.&lt;ref&gt;s7 Niue Constitution Act 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

Niue does not have a [[Bill of rights|Bill of Rights]] guaranteeing [[fundamental rights]] or [[freedom from discrimination]]. Law relevant to human rights can be found in various pieces of ordinary legislation.  Areas of concern include the rights of women, children, and persons who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender (LGBT).

== Legal framework ==

=== International obligations ===

During recent consultations, Niue developed Terms of Reference for a Human Rights Committee which will be responsible for examining the country's human rights obligations arising from international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Niue holds Consultation on Human Rights|url=http://www.forumsec.org/pages.cfm/newsroom/press-statements/2013/niue-holds-consultations-on-human-rights.html|publisher=Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat|accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Niue is party to treaties signed and ratified by New Zealand prior to 1988,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Zealand Ministry of Justice: Contemporary constitutional status of the homelands and modern relations with New Zealand|url=http://www.justice.govt.nz/publications/publications-archived/2000/pacific-peoples-constitution-report-september-2000/contemporary-constitutional-status-of-the-homelands-and-modern-relations-with-new-zealand#3.2|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Converging Currents: Custom and Human Rights in the Pacific|accessdate=20 April 2014|author=New Zealand Law Commission|location=http://www.lawcom.govt.nz/sites/default/files/publications/2006/10/Publication_120_340_SP17.pdf|page=272}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Farran|first=Sue|title=Human Rights in the South Pacific: Challenges and Changes|date=2009|publisher=Routledge-Cavendish|location=London; New York|isbn=1844721094|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR)  
* [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR) 
* [[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]] (CERD)
* [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] (CEDAW)

In 1988, New Zealand submitted a Declaration to the United Nations, stating that treaty obligations it subsequently entered into were to no longer bind Niue.&lt;ref&gt;Repertory of Practice of United Nations Organs 
Supplement No. 8, Volume VI , Article 102 ({{cite web |url=http://legal.un.org/repertory/art102/english/rep_supp8_vol6-art102_e_advance.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019223055/http://legal.un.org/repertory/art102/english/rep_supp8_vol6-art102_e_advance.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-19 |df= }}), pg 10&lt;/ref&gt; Noting that it had become a member of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the Secretary-General recognised Niue's capacity to enter into international treaties in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Repertory of Practice of United Nations Organs 
Supplement No. 8, Volume VI , Article 102 ({{cite web |url=http://legal.un.org/repertory/art102/english/rep_supp8_vol6-art102_e_advance.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019223055/http://legal.un.org/repertory/art102/english/rep_supp8_vol6-art102_e_advance.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-19 |df= }}), pg 10&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Niue acceded to the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] (CRC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Converging Currents: Custom and Human Rights in the Pacific|accessdate=20 April 2014|author=New Zealand Law Commission|location=http://www.lawcom.govt.nz/sites/default/files/publications/2006/10/Publication_120_340_SP17.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a self-governing state, it is responsible for producing its own reports on measures adopted to give effect to international treaties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Status of Women in New Zealand: 2006 CEDAW Report|url=http://mwa.govt.nz/sites/public_files/cedaw06.pdf|accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite offers of assistance from New Zealand,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Zealand's Response to Questions of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (2002)|url=http://www.justice.govt.nz/policy/constitutional-law-and-human-rights/human-rights/international-human-rights-instruments/international-human-rights-instruments-1/procedures-relating-to-the-core-human-rights-instruments-of-the-united-nations/documents-and-other-information-relating-to-the-core-human-rights-instruments-ratified-by-new-zealand/documents-and-other-information-relating-to-the-international-covenant-on-economic-social-and-cultural-rights/second-report/NZ-ICESCR-govt-response-to-list-of-issues-2013-2nd.pdf|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Niue has experienced difficulty in doing so due to its small population and a shortage of resources and expertise. Its initial report under the Convention on the Rights of the Child was due in 1998, but not submitted until 2010.

Niue is not subject to the [[Universal Periodic Review]] process as it is not a [[member state of the United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Member States of the United Nations|url=https://www.un.org/en/members/|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Constitution ===

The [[Niue Constitution Act 1974]] sets out provisions for Niue's self-government. The Constitution of Niue, contained in Schedules 1 (Niuean) and 2 (English), is supreme law.&lt;ref&gt;s 4 Niue Constitution Act 1974&lt;/ref&gt; It prescribes the powers and functions of the executive, legislative and judicial branches of Government. Aside from the right to vote, it does not provide for any fundamental rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Converging Currents: Custom and Human Rights in the Pacific|accessdate=20 April 2014|author=New Zealand Law Commission|location=http://www.lawcom.govt.nz/sites/default/files/publications/2006/10/Publication_120_340_SP17.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously, Article 31 of Schedule 2 set out special rules for proposed legislation which could impact upon human rights. This required the Chief Justice to be invited to comment on the legal, constitutional, and policy issues where a Bill or proposed amendment affected such matters as criminal procedure, definitions of criminal offences, marriage, the law of evidence, and extradition. This Article was repealed by the Constitution Amendment (No 1) Act 1992.

In 1991, a Committee considered the inclusion of specific human rights guarantees in the Constitution in the form of a Bill of Rights, but ultimately rejected this idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Converging Currents: Custom and Human Rights in the Pacific|accessdate=20 April 2014|author=New Zealand Law Commission|location=http://www.lawcom.govt.nz/sites/default/files/publications/2006/10/Publication_120_340_SP17.pdf|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legislation applicable to Niue ===

Legislation that is in force in Niue today consists of: 
* New Zealand legislation that existed on Constitution Day (19 October 1974) which has not subsequently been repealed or amended by the [[Niue Assembly]]&lt;ref&gt;Article 71, Schedule 2, Niue Constitution Act 1974&lt;/ref&gt;
* Legislation passed by the Niue Assembly in accordance with the Niue Constitution Act 1974&lt;ref&gt;Article 28, Schedule 2, Niue Constitution Act 1974&lt;/ref&gt;
* New Zealand legislation passed after Constitution Day which is requested by the Niue Assembly to extend to Niue &lt;ref&gt;Article 36, Schedule 2, Niue Constitution Act 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

Core New Zealand human rights enactments, such as the [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990]] and the [[Human Rights Act 1993 (New Zealand)|Human Rights Act 1993]], do not apply in Niue.

== Human rights issues ==

=== Right to life ===

The death penalty has been abolished in Niue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Death Penalty in the Pacific Islands|url=https://www.amnesty.org.nz/files/Pacific%20islands%20death%20penalty%20notes.pdf|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electoral rights ===

The Niue Assembly has the power to make laws for the "peace, order and good government" of Niue.&lt;ref&gt;Article 28, Schedule 2, Niue Constitution Act 1974&lt;/ref&gt; It has twenty members, elected under a system of [[universal suffrage]],&lt;ref&gt;Part 16, Schedule 2, Niue Constitution Act 1972&lt;/ref&gt; and a Speaker. Elections occur every three years.

A person is not qualified to be registered as an elector if he or she:

* Does not meet residency requirements of section 12 of the Niue Assembly Act 1966;
* Is of unsound mind;&lt;ref&gt;s 12(1)(f) Niue Assembly Act 1966&lt;/ref&gt;
* Is under the age of 18;&lt;ref&gt;s 12(1)(d) Niue Assembly Act 1966&lt;/ref&gt; or
* Has been convicted in Niue or any Commonwealth country of an offence punishable by death or imprisonment of one year or more, and has not received a pardon or undergone the sentence or punishment.&lt;ref&gt;s 12(1)(e) Niue Assembly Act 1966&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Access to justice ===

Issues with access to justice have arisen due to a shortage of persons with the relevant skills and knowledge. There is no system of legal aid,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Human Rights Institutions Pathways for Pacific States Pacific Human Rights Issues Series: 1|url=http://www.hrc.co.nz/hrc_new/hrc/cms/files/documents/09-Jul-2007_12-52-44_Pacific_Paper.pdf|publisher=New Zealand Human Rights Commission|accessdate=29 April 2014|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a survey carried out in 2011 found there were only six lawyers in Niue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Needs Evaluation Survey for South Pacific Lawyers' Association – Final Report|url=http://www.pso.gov.sb/index.php/resources/doc_download/191-needs-evaluation-survey-for-south-pacific-lawyer-associations|accessdate=28 April 2014|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Niue is a member of the Pacific Judicial Development Programme, which aims to improve the operation of the justice system in the Pacific region by providing training and support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pacific Judicial Development Programme|url=http://www.fedcourt.gov.au/pjdp|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Freedom of religion ===

There are no legislative restrictions on religious belief or practice, however the Constitution does not guarantee [[freedom of religion]], nor is there any legislation which prohibits discrimination on the grounds of religion. The majority of Niueans are Christian,&lt;ref&gt;Niue Census of Population and Households 2011, Government of Niue. p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Niue: A Situation Analysis of Women, Children and Youth|url=http://www.unicef.org/pacificislands/Niue_Sitan_Report_Latest_pdf.pdf|accessdate=28 April 2014|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some laws, such as bans on fishing&lt;ref&gt;s 13 Domestic Fishing Act 1995&lt;/ref&gt; and exhibiting films &lt;ref&gt;s 15 Film and Public Entertainment Act 1979&lt;/ref&gt; on Sundays, reflect this{{clarify|date=May 2014}}.

=== Freedom of expression ===

While the Constitution does not expressly guarantee [[freedom of expression]], there are few restrictions on what can be said or published in Niue. Inciting racial disharmony is an imprisonable offence.&lt;ref&gt;s 19 Race Relations Act 1972&lt;/ref&gt; Persons who make statements which constitute libel or slander are also liable to imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;s 187 Niue Act 1966&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Labour law ===

The Government is the main employer in Niue.&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Rights of the Child: State party's report: CRC/C/NIU/1 (11 July 2011), para 94&lt;/ref&gt; Conditions of employment, entitlement to leave, and processes for promotions and disciplinary action in the public sector are laid down by the Public Service Regulations 2004. Retirement is compulsory for permanent employees in the public service upon reaching the age of 55.&lt;ref&gt;Part 30 Public Service Regulations 2004&lt;/ref&gt; There is no labour law for workers employed in the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Rights of the Child: State party's report: CRC/C/NIU/1 (11 July 2011), para 94&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Racial discrimination ===

It is unlawful to refuse access to public places, vehicles and facilities,&lt;ref&gt;s 3 Race Relations Act 1972&lt;/ref&gt; provision of goods or services,&lt;ref&gt;s 4 Race Relations Act 1972&lt;/ref&gt; employment,&lt;ref&gt;s 5 Race Relations Act 1972&lt;/ref&gt; or access to land and housing&lt;ref&gt;s 6 Race Relations Act 1972&lt;/ref&gt; on the basis of colour, race, or ethnic or national origins. Persons who believe themselves to be aggrieved by these provisions are entitled to bring civil proceedings in court.&lt;ref&gt;s 10 Race Relations Act 1972&lt;/ref&gt; Agreements in relation to real property are void to the extent that they prohibit or restrict dealings by reason of the colour, race or ethnic origins of an individual or their family.&lt;ref&gt;s 33A Property Law Act 1952&lt;/ref&gt; Persons who incite racial disharmony through the use of threatening or abusive words are liable to imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;s 19 Race Relations Act 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Women's rights ===

Although there is no law prohibiting discrimination on the grounds of sex or gender, Niue generally "offer[s] women equality under the law".&lt;ref&gt;2012 Pacific Regional Millennium Development Goals Tracking Report: Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat p. 102 (http://www.forumsec.org/resources/uploads/attachments/documents/MDG%20Track%20Rpt%20web%2020122.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; It is on track to meet its [[Millennium Development Goals]] of 2015 in relation to promoting gender equality and empowering women.&lt;ref&gt;2012 Pacific Regional Millennium Development Goals Tracking Report: Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat (http://www.forumsec.org/resources/uploads/attachments/documents/MDG%20Track%20Rpt%20web%2020122.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; There have been no reports of maternal deaths since 1980,&lt;ref&gt;2012 Pacific Regional Millennium Development Goals Tracking Report: Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat, p. 103 (http://www.forumsec.org/resources/uploads/attachments/documents/MDG%20Track%20Rpt%20web%2020122.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; gender parity has been achieved in primary and tertiary education,&lt;ref&gt;2012 Pacific Regional Millennium Development Goals Tracking Report: Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat, p. 102 (http://www.forumsec.org/resources/uploads/attachments/documents/MDG%20Track%20Rpt%20web%2020122.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; and there is high participation of women in government.&lt;ref&gt;2012 Pacific Regional Millennium Development Goals Tracking Report: Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat, p. 102 (http://www.forumsec.org/resources/uploads/attachments/documents/MDG%20Track%20Rpt%20web%2020122.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;

There are, however, areas of concern. Domestic violence is "pervasive"&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Rights of the Child: Concluding observations on the initial report of Niue: CRC/C/NIU/CO/1* (24 June 2013), para 36&lt;/ref&gt; and tends to be managed by families themselves rather the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Niue: A Situation Analysis of Women, Children and Youth|url=http://www.unicef.org/pacificislands/Niue_Sitan_Report_Latest_pdf.pdf|accessdate=28 April 2014|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is presently no legislation which deals specifically with this issue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Briefing on Sexual and Gender-based Violence in the Pacific: Regional Overview and Call for Action|url=https://www.amnesty.org.nz/files/FINALBriefing-on-SGBV-in-the-Pacific.pdf|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; although work is under way on a Family Protection Bill which is expected to provide measures for the punishment of perpetrators and the protection of victims of domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Rights of the Child: Written Replies of Niue: CRC/C/NIU/Q/1/Add.1 (13 January 2013), paras 36-39&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marital rape]] is not a criminal offence in Niue. A man cannot be convicted of the rape or attempted rape of his wife unless a decree nisi of divorce, decree of nullity, judicial separation, or separation order was in place at the time of the act.&lt;ref&gt;s 162 Niue Act 1966&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual violence against girls is addressed in the Niue Act 1966, which provides that those who have or attempt sexual intercourse with a girl under 15 are liable to terms of imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;s 163 Niue Act 1966&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, sexual assault on minors has been reported as occurring “regularly”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Niue: A Situation Analysis of Women, Children and Youth|url=http://www.unicef.org/pacificislands/Niue_Sitan_Report_Latest_pdf.pdf|accessdate=28 April 2014|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural and societal beliefs have the effect of inhibiting the reporting of these offences.

Due to a lack of reproductive health education&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Niue: A Situation Analysis of Women, Children and Youth|url=http://www.unicef.org/pacificislands/Niue_Sitan_Report_Latest_pdf.pdf|accessdate=28 April 2014|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the societal attitude that all children are "blessings and gifts from God",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Niue: A Situation Analysis of Women, Children and Youth|url=http://www.unicef.org/pacificislands/Niue_Sitan_Report_Latest_pdf.pdf|accessdate=28 April 2014|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; teen pregnancy is common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Niue: A Situation Analysis of Women, Children and Youth|url=http://www.unicef.org/pacificislands/Niue_Sitan_Report_Latest_pdf.pdf|accessdate=28 April 2014|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abortion is not currently available in Niue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Niue: A Situation Analysis of Women, Children and Youth|url=http://www.unicef.org/pacificislands/Niue_Sitan_Report_Latest_pdf.pdf|accessdate=28 April 2014|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its legality is unclear. The Niue Act 1966 provides that it is an offence to “unlawfully procure” or administer an abortion,&lt;ref&gt;ss 166-168 Niue Act 1966&lt;/ref&gt; which suggests that some abortions may be lawful. In particular, the common law defence&lt;ref&gt;s 238 Niue Act 1966&lt;/ref&gt; of necessity could be applicable in the event of endangerment to a woman’s life or health.&lt;ref&gt;Abortion Policy in Niue: United Nations Department for Economic and Social Affairs (www.un.org/esa/population/publications/abortion/doc/niue.doc)&lt;/ref&gt; This remains untested in Court.

It used to be an offence to be the keeper of a brothel in Niue, as was being a prostitute,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Niue Laws Legislation As At December 2006 - Niue Act 1966|url=http://www.ffa.int/system/files/Niue_Act_1966.pdf|website=[[Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency]]|accessdate=6 February 2018|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but these offences were repealed by the Niue Amendment Act 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Niue Amendment Act 2007 No 71, Public Act Contents – New Zealand Legislation |url=http://legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2007/0071/latest/DLM968429.html |website=legislation.govt.nz|accessdate=6 February 2018|language=en-NZ|date=19 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Niue Act 1966 as at 20 September 2007|url=http://www.wipo.int/edocs/lexdocs/laws/en/nu/nu001en.pdf|website=[[World Intellectual Property Organization]]|accessdate=6 February 2018|date=20 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The minimum age of marriage for females in Niue is 15. The United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child has recommended raising this to 18, to match the minimum age for males.&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Rights of the Child: Concluding observations on the initial report of Niue: CRC/C/NIU/CO/1* (24 June 2013), para 23&lt;/ref&gt;

=== LGBT rights ===
{{main|LGBT rights in Niue}}
Same-sex relationships have been identified by Niue as an issue which “may be the subject of reform”&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Rights of the Child: Written Replies of Niue: CRC/C/NIU/Q/1/Add.1 (13 January 2013), paras 4, 5&lt;/ref&gt; in the coming years.

Current Niue law does not make any specific reference to those who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. [[Same-sex marriage]] is not recognised&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Joint project of UNDP Pacific Centre, Regional Rights Resource Team SPC and UNAIDS|title=HIV, Ethics and Human Rights|url=http://www.undppc.org.fj/_resources/article/files/Niue_HIV_Ethics_and_HR_review_of_legislation.pdf|accessdate=20 April 2014|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is no legislation prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. Sexual activity between males is criminalised by the Niue Act 1966. Those who commit the offence of “buggery” are liable to imprisonment for 10 years,&lt;ref&gt;s 170 Niue Act 1986&lt;/ref&gt; while “indecent assault” between males carries a potential 5-year term of imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;s 171 Niue Act 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Consent is no defence to either of these offences. There is no legislation relating to female same-sex sexual conduct.

There is no provision for a change of sex on official documents under the Births and Deaths Registration Regulations 1984.

=== Children's rights ===

The definition of a child varies greatly under Niue law. Individuals may sue and be sued in infancy, are entitled to drive at age 14, may purchase liquor at 18, and can be adopted up to age 21.&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Rights of the Child: State party's report: CRC/C/NIU/1 (11 July 2011), para 92&lt;/ref&gt; Those under 18 are prohibited from permanent employment in the public service,&lt;ref&gt;Part 24, Public Service Regulations 2004&lt;/ref&gt; however there is no minimum age to undertake other work. As Niue has no labour law for those employed in the private sector, children who take on employment outside of the public service have no legal protection from poor working conditions or exploitation.

Enrolment and attendance at a school is compulsory for children between the ages of 5 and 16.&lt;ref&gt;s 24 Education Act 1989&lt;/ref&gt; All education provided by Government schools is free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;s 19 Education Act 1989&lt;/ref&gt; It is the duty of parents to ensure their child of school age is enrolled and attends school, and failure to do so without excuse or exemption is an offence.&lt;ref&gt;ss 28, 30 Education Act 1989&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the enrolment rate of primary and secondary school aged children was 100%.&lt;ref&gt;Niue Census of Population and Households 2011, Government of Niue. p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The use of [[corporal punishment]] at school is not expressly prohibited by law. Legislation relating to cruel treatment&lt;ref&gt;s157A Niue Act 1966&lt;/ref&gt; and bodily harm&lt;ref&gt;ss 151-153 Niue Act 1966&lt;/ref&gt; is not interpreted as outlawing corporal punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Rights of the Child: Concluding observations on the initial report of Niue: CRC/C/NIU/CO/1* (24 June 2013), para 34&lt;/ref&gt; Acceptance of corporal punishment in the home is "near universal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Niue Pathways to the Prevention of Sexual Violence|url=http://www.mpia.govt.nz/assets/documents/corporate-documents-2/05-Niue-PPSV-online-version.pdf|publisher=School of Population Health, University of Auckland|accessdate=29 April 2014|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rights of persons with disabilities ===

Legislation requires that children with physical or mental disabilities be educated at a "special school" or institution,&lt;ref&gt;s 27 Education Act 1989&lt;/ref&gt; however Niue has no teachers with training in special needs education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Niue: A Situation Analysis of Women, Children and Youth|url=http://www.unicef.org/pacificislands/Niue_Sitan_Report_Latest_pdf.pdf|accessdate=28 April 2014|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also of concern is reference in the Niue Act 1966 to women and girls who are "idiots, imbeciles or of unsound mind", and the lower criminal sanction for those who sexually offend against such individuals.&lt;ref&gt;s 165 Niue Act 1966&lt;/ref&gt;

Niue adopted a National Policy on Disability in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Rights of the Child: Concluding observations on the initial report of Niue: CRC/C/NIU/CO/1* (24 June 2013), para 49&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''I Write What I Like''''' (full name ''I Write What I Like: Selected Writings by Steve Biko'') is a compilation of writings from anti-[[History of South Africa in the apartheid era|apartheid]] [[activism|activist]] [[Steve Biko]].

''I Write What I Like'' contains a selection of Biko's writings from 1969, when he became the president of the [[South African Student Organisation]], to 1972, when he was prohibited from publishing.  Originally published in 1978, the book was republished in 1987 and April 2002. The book's title was taken from the title under which he had published his writings in the SASO newsletter under the pseudonym [[Frank Talk]].&lt;ref name = "isbn0435905988"&gt;{{cite book | author = Steve Biko | title = I Write What I Like| publisher = Heinemann |pages=19|isbn = 0-435-90598-8 |date =1987 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Aq5PJWaSTzUC&amp;pg=PA19#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''I Write What I Like'' reflects Biko's conviction that black people in [[South Africa]] could not be liberated until they united to break their chains of servitude, a key tenet of the [[Black Consciousness Movement]] that he helped found.

The collection was edited by [[Aelred Stubbs]].  The book includes a preface by [[Archbishop]] [[Desmond Tutu]]; an introduction by [[Malusi]] and [[Thoko Mpumlwana]], who were both involved with Biko in the [[Black Consciousness Movement]]; a memoir of Biko by Father Aelred Stubbs, his longtime pastor and friend; and a new foreword by Professor [[Lewis Gordon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://abahlali.org/node/3039 The introduction is online at the Abahlali baseMjondolo website]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''kibbutz''' ({{lang-he-n|קִבּוּץ}} / {{Hebrew|קיבוץ}}, lit. "gathering, clustering"; regular plural '''kibbutzim''' {{Hebrew|קִבּוּצִים}} / {{Hebrew|קיבוצים}}) is a [[Intentional community|collective community]] in [[Israel]] that was traditionally based on [[agriculture]]. The first kibbutz, established in 1909, was [[Degania Alef|Degania]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Jerusalem-Report/Adult-Children-of-the-Dream "Adult children of the dream"], ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', June 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Today, farming has been partly supplanted by other economic branches, including [[Factory|industrial plants]] and [[high-tech]] [[Business|enterprises]].&lt;ref name="Peres"&gt;Peres, Judy. [http://www.texnews.com/1998/religion/kibbutz0509.html ''In 50 years, kibbutz movement has undergone many changes.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017140825/http://texnews.com/1998/religion/kibbutz0509.html |date=2007-10-17 }} ''Chicago Tribune'', 9 May 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Kibbutzim began as [[utopian]] communities, a combination of [[socialism]] and [[Zionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=From utopia to total institution in a single generation: the kibbutz and Bruderhof |author=Sheldon Goldenberg and Gerda R. Wekerle |journal=International Review of Modern Sociology |volume=2 |issue=2 |date=September 1972 |pages=224–232 |jstor=41420450}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent decades, some kibbutzim have been privatized and changes have been made in the communal lifestyle. A member of a kibbutz is called a ''kibbutznik'' ({{lang-he-n|קִבּוּצְנִיק}} / {{Hebrew|קיבוצניק}}; plural ''kibbutznikim'' or ''kibbutzniks'').

In 2010, there were 270 kibbutzim in Israel. Their factories and farms account for 9% of Israel's industrial output, worth US$8 billion, and 40% of its agricultural output, worth over $1.7 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2010/11/16/2003488628/2 Kibbutz reinvents itself after 100 years of history], ''[[Taipei Times]]'', November 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Some kibbutzim had also developed substantial high-tech and military industries. For example, in 2010, [[Sasa, Israel|Kibbutz Sasa]], containing some 200 members, generated $850 million in annual revenue from its military-plastics industry.&lt;ref name="fastcompany.com"&gt;[http://www.fastcompany.com/3007444/tech-forecast/bulletproof-innovation-kibbutz-owned-plasan-sasas-ikea-style-flat-pack-armor-k Bulletproof Innovation: Kibbutz-Owned Plasan Sasa's Ikea-Style, Flat-Pack Armor Kits] By Nadav Shemer, [[Fast Company (magazine)|''Fast Company'']],&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently the kibbutzim are organised in the secular [[Kibbutz Movement]] with some  230 kibbutzim, the [[Religious Kibbutz Movement]] with 16 kibbutzim and the much smaller religious [[Poalei Agudat Yisrael]] with two kibbutzim, all part of the wider [[Settlement movement (Israel)|communal settlement movement]].

==History==
===The first kibbutzim===
[[File:Second aliyah Pioneers in Migdal 1912 in kuffiyeh.jpg|thumb|250px|Second Aliyah workers eating lunch in the fields of Migdal.]]
The kibbutzim were founded by members of the [[Bilu]] movement who emigrated to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. Like the members of the [[First Aliyah]] who came before them and established agricultural villages, most members of the [[Second Aliyah]] planned to become farmers; almost the sole career available in the agrarian economy of Ottoman Palestine. The first kibbutz was [[Degania Alef]], founded in 1909.

Joseph Baratz, one of the pioneers of the kibbutz movement, wrote a book about his experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Gavron|first=Daniel|title=The Kibbutz: Awakening from Utopia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5wifOjaA2BoC&amp;pg=PA20|year=2000|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-8476-9526-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"We were happy enough working on the land, but we knew more and more certainly that the ways of the old settlements were not for us. This was not the way we hoped to settle the country—this old way with Jews on top and Arabs working for them; anyway, we thought that there shouldn't be employers and employed at all. There must be a better way."&lt;ref name=Baratz52&gt;Baratz, Joseph. ''A Village by the Jordan: The Story of Degania''. Tel Aviv: Ichud Habonim, 1956, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Baratz and others wanted to farm the land themselves, becoming independent farmers was not a realistic option in 1909. As [[Arthur Ruppin]], a proponent of Jewish agricultural colonization of the Trans-Jordan would later say, "The question was not whether group settlement was preferable to individual settlement; it was rather one of either group settlement or no settlement at all."&lt;ref name=Rayman12&gt;Rayman, Paula. ''The Kibbutz Community and Nation Building''. Princeton University Press, 1981. p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Palestine was a harsh environment.  The Galilee was swampy, the [[Judaean Mountains]] rocky, and the south of the country, the [[Negev]], was a desert. To make things more challenging, most of the settlers had no prior farming experience. The sanitary conditions were also poor. [[Malaria]], [[typhus]] and [[cholera]] were rampant. [[Bedouin]]s would raid farms and settled areas. Sabotage of irrigation canals and burning of crops were also common.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} Living collectively was simply the most logical way to be secure in an unwelcoming land. On top of safety considerations, establishing a farm was a capital-intensive project; collectively, the founders of the kibbutzim had the resources to establish something lasting, while independently they did not.

Finally, the land had been purchased by the greater Jewish community. From around the world, Jews dropped coins into [[Jewish National Fund]] "Blue Boxes" for land purchases in Palestine. In 1909, Baratz, nine other men, and two women established themselves at the southern end of the [[Sea of Galilee]] near the Arab village of Umm Juni/Juniya. These teenagers had hitherto worked as day laborers converting wetlands for human development, as masons, or as hands at the older Jewish settlements. Their dream was now to work for themselves, building up the land. They called their community "[[Kvutza]]t Degania" (lit. "collective of wheat" or "community of [[cereal]] grains"), now [[Degania Alef]].

The founders of Degania endured backbreaking labor: "The body is crushed, the legs fail, the head hurts, the sun burns and weakens," wrote one of the pioneers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Gavron|first=Daniel|title=The Kibbutz: Awakening from Utopia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5wifOjaA2BoC&amp;pg=PA20|year=2000|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-8476-9526-3|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; At times, half of the kibbutz members could not report for work and many left. Despite the difficulties, by 1914, Degania had fifty members. Other kibbutzim were founded around the Sea of Galilee and the nearby [[Jezreel Valley]].

===During the British Mandate===
[[File:Lotan.jpg|thumb|250px| [[Lotan, Israel|Kibbutz Lotan]]]]
The fall of the Ottoman Empire at the end of [[World War I]], followed by the arrival of the British, brought with it benefits for the Jewish community of Palestine and its kibbutzim. The Ottoman authorities had made immigration to Palestine difficult and restricted land purchases. Rising antisemitism forced many Jews to flee Eastern Europe. To escape the [[pogrom]]s, tens of thousands of Russian Jews immigrated to Palestine in the early 1920s, in a wave of immigration that was called the [[Third Aliyah]].

Zionist Jewish youth movements flourished in the 1920s, from right-wing movements like [[Betar]] to left-wing socialist groups such as Dror, Brit Haolim, Qadima, HabBonim (now [[Habonim Dror]]), and [[Hashomer Hatzair]]. In contrast to those who came as part of the Second Aliyah, these youth group members had some agricultural training before embarking. Members of the Second Aliyah and Third Aliyah were also less likely to be Russian, since emigration from Russia was closed off after the [[Russian Revolution]]. European Jews who settled on kibbutzim between the World Wars were from other countries in Eastern Europe, including [[Germany]].

In the early days, communal meetings were limited to practical matters, but in the 1920s and 1930s, they became more informal. Instead of meeting in the dining room, the group would sit around a campfire. Rather than reading minutes, the session would begin with a group dance. Remembering her youth on a kibbutz on the shores of the [[Sea of Galilee|Kinneret]], one woman said: "Oh, how beautiful it was when we all took part in the discussions, [they were] nights of searching for one another—that is what I call those hallowed nights. During the moments of silence, it seemed to me that from each heart a spark would burst forth, and the sparks would unite in one great flame penetrating the heavens.... At the center of our camp a fire burns, and under the weight of the [[hora (dance)|hora]] the earth groans a rhythmic groan, accompanied by wild songs".&lt;ref name=Gavron45&gt;Gavron, Daniel. ''The Kibbutz: Awakening from Utopia'' Rowman &amp; Littlefield, Lanham, 2000, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

Kibbutzim founded in the 1920s tended to be larger than the kibbutzim like Degania that were founded prior to World War I. Degania had had twelve members at its founding. Eyn Harod, founded only a decade later, began with 215 members.

Kibbutzim grew and flourished in the 1930s and 1940s. In 1922, there were 700 people living on kibbutzim in Palestine. By 1927, the number had risen to 2,000. When [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]] erupted, 24,105 people were living on 79 kibbutzim, comprising 5% of the Jewish population of Mandate Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mj.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/15/2/207 "The Kibbutz in Historical Perspective", Mark A. Raider]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, the figures went up to 65,000, accounting for 7.5% of the population. In 1989, the kibbutz population peaked at 129,000. By 2010, the number decreased to about 100,000; the number of kibbutzim in Israel was 270.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Esty Aharonovitz |date=17 June 2010 |script-title=he:מה קורה לוותיקי החברים אחרי שהקיבוץ הופרט? לא משהו טוב |language=Hebrew |trans-title=What happens after kibbutz members veterans privatized? Not something good |url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/misc/1.1207651 |work=Haaretz |accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development of kibbutz movements===
In 1927, the [[Kibbutz Movement#United Kibbutz Movement|United Kibbutz Movement]] was established. Several [[Hashomer Hatzair]] kibbutzim banded together to form [[Kibbutz Movement#Kibbutz Artzi|Kibbutz Artzi]]. In 1936, [[Socialist League of Palestine]] was founded, and served as an urban ally of HaKibbutz HaArtzi. In 1946, HaKibbutz HaArtzi and the Socialist League combined to form the [[Hashomer Hatzair Workers Party of Palestine]] which in 1948, merged with [[Ahdut HaAvoda]] to form the left-wing [[Mapam]] party.

[[File:Kiryat Anavim barn.jpg|thumb|First building in Kibbutz [[Kiryat Anavim]], a dairy barn]]
In 1928, Degania and other small kibbutzim formed ''Hever Hakvutzot'' ("The Kvutzot Association"). Kvutzot were deliberately small, not exceeding 200 members, in the belief that this was imperative for maintaining trust. Kvutzot did not have youth-group affiliations in Europe. Kibbutzim affiliated with the United Kibbutz Movement took in as many members as they could. [[Givat Brenner]] eventually came to have more than 1,500 members. Artzi kibbutzim were also more devoted to [[gender equality]] than other kibbutzim. Women called their husbands ''ishi'' ("my man") rather than the customary Hebrew word for husband ''ba'ali'' (lit. "my master"). The children slept in children's houses and visited their parents only a few hours a day.

There were also differences in religion. Kibbutz Artzi and United Kibbutz Movement kibbutzim were [[Secularity|secular]], even staunchly [[atheism|atheistic]], proudly trying to be "[[convent|monasteries]] without God". Most mainstream kibbutznikim also disdained the [[Orthodox Judaism]] of their parents, but they wanted their new communities to have Jewish characteristics nonetheless. Friday nights were still [[Shabbat]] with a white tablecloth and fine food and work was not done on Saturday if it could be avoided. Only late some kibbutzim adopted [[Yom Kippur]] as the day to discuss fears for the future of the kibbutz. Kibbutzim also had collective [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah]]s for their children.

Kibbutznikim did not pray several times a day, but would mark holidays like [[Shavuot]], [[Sukkot]], and [[Passover]] with dances, meals, and celebrations. One Jewish holiday, [[Tu BiShvat]], the "birthday of the trees" was substantially revived by kibbutzim. All in all, holidays with some kind of agricultural component, like Passover and Sukkot, were the most significant for kibbutzim.

Religious kibbutzim were established in clusters before the establishment of the State, creating the [[Religious Kibbutz Movement]]. The first religious kibbutz was [[Ein Tzurim]], founded in 1946.

===Statebuilding===
Arab opposition increased as the [[Balfour Declaration]] and the wave of Jewish settlers to Palestine began to tilt the demographic balance of the area. There were bloody anti-Arab and anti-Jewish riots in Jerusalem in 1921 and in Hebron in 1929. In the late 1930s, Arab–Jewish violence became virtually constant; the [[1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine]] is also known as the "Great Uprising" in Palestinian historiography.
[[File:Kibbutz Guard 1936.jpg|150px|right|thumb|A member of [[Ma'abarot, Israel|Kibbutz Ma'abarot]] on guard duty, 1936]]
Kibbutzim began to assume a more prominent military role. Rifles were purchased or manufactured and kibbutz members drilled and practiced shooting. [[Yigal Allon]], an Israeli soldier and statesman, explained the role of kibbutzim in the military activities of the [[Yishuv]]:
{{quote|The planning and development of pioneering Zionist were from the start at least partly determined by politico-strategic needs. The choice of the location of the settlements, for instance, was influenced not only by considerations of economic viability but also and even chiefly by the needs of local defense, overall settlement strategy, and by the role such blocks of settlements might play in some future, perhaps decisive all-out struggle. Accordingly, land was purchased, or more often reclaimed, in remote parts of the country.&lt;ref name=Rayman&gt;quoted in Rayman, pp. 27–28.&lt;!--Needs a full citation, here and/or in Refs--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Kibbutzim also played a role in defining the borders of the Jewish state-to-be. By the late 1930s, when it appeared that Palestine would be [[Partition (politics)|partitioned]] between Arabs and Jews, kibbutzim were established in outlying areas to ensure that the land would be incorporated into the Jewish state. In 1946, on the day after [[Yom Kippur]], [[11 points in the Negev|eleven new "Tower and Stockade" kibbutzim]] were hurriedly established in the northern part of the Negev to give Israel a better claim to this arid, but strategically important, region. The [[Marxism|Marxist]] faction of the kibbutz movement, Kibbutz Artzi, favoured a [[one-state solution]] over partition, but advocated free Jewish immigration, which the Arabs opposed.

Kibbutzniks fought in the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], emerging from the conflict with enhanced prestige in the nascent State of Israel. Members of Kibbutz Degania were instrumental in stopping the [[Syria]]n tank advance into the Galilee with [[Molotov cocktail]]s. Maagan Michael manufactured the bullets for the [[Sten]] guns that won the war. Maagan Michael's clandestine [[ammunition]] factory was later separated from the kibbutz and grew into [[Israel Military Industries]].

==After the establishment of the state==
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 695 Gat ילדי הקיבוץ וחיילי גבעתי.jpg|thumb|310px|Kibbutz children with the Givati brigade]]

The establishment of Israel and the flood of Jewish refugees from Europe and the Arab world presented challenges and opportunities for kibbutzim. The immigrant tide offered kibbutzim a chance to expand through new members and inexpensive labour, but it also meant that [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] kibbutzim would have to adapt to Jews whose background was far different from their own. Until the 1950s, nearly all kibbutzniks were from Eastern Europe, culturally different from the Jews of [[Morocco]], [[Tunisia]], and [[Iraq]]. Many kibbutzim hired [[Mizrahi Jews]] as labourers but were less inclined to grant them membership.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

Ideological disputes were also widespread, leading to painful splits, sometimes even of individual kibbutzim, and to polarisation and animosity among members.&lt;ref name="Drezon1990"&gt;{{cite book |author= Marcia Drezon-Tepler |title= Interest Groups and Political Change in Israel |page=104 |publisher= State University of New York Press (SUNY Press) |year=1990 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=UbwSzm1ajrEC&amp;pg=PA104 |isbn=978-0-7914-0207-8 |accessdate=26 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel had been initially recognized by both the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. For the first three years of its existence, Israel was in the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], but [[David Ben-Gurion]] gradually began to take sides with the [[Western world|West]]. The question of which side of the [[Cold War]] Israel should choose created fissures in the kibbutz movement. Dining halls segregated according to politics and a few kibbutzim even had Marxist members leave. The disillusionment particularly set in after the [[Slánský trial]] in which an envoy of Hashomer Hatzair in Prague was tried.

Another controversy involved the [[Reparations Agreement between Israel and West Germany]]. Should kibbutz members turn over income that was the product of a very personal loss? If Holocaust survivors were allowed to keep their reparation money, what would that mean for the principle of equality? Eventually, many kibbutzim made this one concession to inequality by letting Holocaust survivors keep all or a percentage of their reparations. Reparations that were turned over to the collective were used for building expansion and even recreational activities.

The split between different factions within the kibbutz movement evolved between 1948 and 1954, when finally three kibbutz federations emerged, each aligned to a different Labour party: [[Ihud HaKvutzot VeHaKibbutzim|Ihud]] with [[Mapai]], [[HaKibbutz HaMeuhad|Meuhad]] with [[Ahdut HaAvoda]], and [[HaKibbutz HaArtzi|Artzi]] with [[Mapam]].&lt;ref name="Drezon1990"/&gt;

Kibbutzniks enjoyed a steady and gradual improvement in their standard of living in the first few decades after independence. In the 1960s, the kibbutzim standard of living improved faster than Israel's general population. Most kibbutz swimming pools date from the 1960s.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 3584 Gan-Shmuel sb12- 7.jpg|thumb|left|Collecting bales of hay on Kibbutz [[Gan Shmuel]], 1950s]]
Kibbutzim also continued to play an outsize role in Israel's defence apparatus. In the 1950s and 1960s many kibbutzim were in fact founded by an [[Israel Defense Forces]] group called [[Nahal]]. Many of these 1950s and 1960s Nahal kibbutzim were founded on the precarious and porous borders of the state. In the [[Six-Day War]], when Israel lost 800 soldiers, 200 of them were from kibbutzim. The prestige that kibbutzniks enjoyed in Israel in the 1960s was reflected in the [[Knesset]]. When only 4% of Israelis were kibbutzniks, kibbutzniks made up 15% of Israel's parliament.&lt;ref name=Bettelheim15&gt;[[Bruno Bettelheim|Bettelheim, Bruno]]. ''The Children of the Dream'', Simon &amp; Schuster, 2001, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

As late as the 1970s, kibbutzim seemed to be thriving in every way. Kibbutzniks performed working-class, or even peasant-class, occupations, yet enjoyed a middle-class lifestyle.

===Decline and restructuring===
{{See also|Kibbutz crisis}}
With time, the kibbutz members' sense of identification with the kibbutz and its goals decreased. This process originated both from personal frustrations among the kibbutz members as a result of internal processes and from the growing stratification and inequality due to the growth of capitalistic practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Reuven |last=Shapira |title=Academic Capital or Scientific Progress? A critique of studies of kibbutz stratification |journal=Journal of Anthropological Research |volume=61 |year=2005 |issue=3 |pages=357–380 |jstor=3631324 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, some kibbutz members established professional careers outside the kibbutz, accumulating power, privileges and prestige.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Reuven |last=Shapira |title=Communal decline: The vanishing of high-moral leaders and the decay of democratic, high-trust kibbutz cultures |journal=Sociological Inquiry |volume=71 |year=2001 |issue=1 |pages=13–38 |doi=10.1111/j.1475-682X.2001.tb00926.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; The balance between individual values and values of the kibbutz began to tip, and work motivation was affected. An emphasis was placed on social compensation to encourage productivity. These processes occurred in parallel with a [[Kibbutz crisis|severe economic crisis]].
* The [[Privatization in Israel|privatization]] processes and the adoption of non-cooperative beliefs in all of the Israeli society, affected the moral and structural support of kibbutzim, and with the years penetrated the new generations of the kibbutzim.
* The kibbutzim were built on the attempt to create a permanent and institutionalized framework, which would be able to set a pattern of conduct that would successfully handle the implementation of shared values. The attempt to place such a regular pattern required creativity in the adoption of kibbutz practices to its growth and changing kibbutz system and encompassing society, but kibbutz leadership suppressed innovators and critical thinkers, causing either failures to deal with changes or adoption of capitalist solutions that negated kibbutz basic principles.&lt;ref&gt;Reuven Shapira - ''Transforming Kibbutz Research'', Cleveland: New World Publishing, 2008, Chaps. 12–17.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The kibbutzim had [[rural]] patterns of settlements, while over the years the Israeli society began adopting [[Urban area|urban]] patterns of settlements. The lack of match between the patterns of the kibbutz society and the majority of the Israeli society, appealed the strong linkage between the kibbutzim with the entire Israeli society, a principle that did not allow the continuation of the collaborative model (because of the internal weakening and the loss of the all-Israeli legitimacy).
* The kibbutzim were established during the pioneer period and were the fulfilment of the Zionist vision, during that period of time every member was required to give the maximum from himself for the good of the collective: the kibbutz and the state. In addition, as a group it was easier to deal with the common problems of the individuals—which allowed the recruitment of a large number of people for maintaining the safety of the community at that time, and therefore this way of life was suited for the Zionist goals more than other forms of life at that time.
* The original concept of the kibbutzim was based to a large extent on self-sacrifice of its members for the sake of abstract foundations and not on the cancellation of work, and therefore after the pioneer period the linkage between the kibbutz members decreased, due to the decline in the pioneering spirit and the decline in the importance of the self-sacrifice values.
* When the kibbutz was perceived as an initiator for values and national objectives, it was very much appreciated in the Israeli society and it was easier for the members to identify themselves with the kibbutz, its function and its significance. With the decrease of its appreciation and the minimizing of the social significances in the Israeli society, the kibbutz identity weakened.
* The kibbutzim were not capable of dealing with the increase in the standard of living in order to keep the communal values relevant, which eventually led to the changes in patterns of life of many members, undermining the relevancy of the communal framework, which was not adapted to this.
* The [[globalization]] processes and the kibbutz failure to block them exposed the kibbutz society to a different type of culture. For example, after kibbutz members were allowed to have television sets in their own homes, the kibbutz members were exposed to "the good life" in which people were compensated for their work and could buy themselves different luxurious items. The kibbutzim were not capable of dealing with these processes.&lt;ref&gt;Carmeli Y. and Applbaum K. [Eds.] 2004. ''Consumption and Market Society in Israel''. Berg Publishers: Oxford&lt;/ref&gt;
* The collapse of the Communist bloc resulted in the weakening of [[Socialist]] beliefs around the world, including in the kibbutz society.

During the 1980s, following the peak of the kibbutzim crisis, many people started leaving their kibbutzim, and there was considerable tension due to the economic situation. In order to cope with the situation, some kibbutzim began to change in various ways.

The changes that occurred could be divided into three main types:
* '''Extensive privatization of the kibbutz services'''—in fact, such privatization had been introduced over the past two decades in many kibbutzim. Most of these privatization processes, however, were made in matters that were considered relatively minor. Currently, many kibbutzim that have privatized (some of them with subsidies) have also privatized the [[education]] and [[Health care systems|health]] systems, which were once considered untouchable.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}
* '''"Differential wage"'''—one famous characteristic of the kibbutzim was that each kibbutz member received an equal budget according to his or her needs, regardless of what job they held. In many kibbutzim, members are now paid differentially based on the work they do.
* '''"Association of properties"'''—refers to the transfer of some of the properties belonging to the kibbutz, in its capacity as a cooperative commonality, to the ownership of individual kibbutz members. This is actually true privatization (unlike the services privatization). These assets include the homes where the members live and a sort of a "stock" in the manufacturing component of the kibbutz. This change allows kibbutz members to sell and bequeath both types of properties, within certain limitations.

Since the mid-1990s, the number of kibbutzim making significant changes in their lifestyle has continued to grow, while the resistance to these changes has gradually decreased, with only a few dozen kibbutzim still functioning under more traditional models. It is important to note, however, that each kibbutz has undergone different processes of change. There are many people, outside and inside the kibbutzim, who claim these changes bring the end of the kibbutz concept. Among the communities that had recently officially ceased being kibbutzim are [[Megiddo (kibbutz)|Megiddo]] in the Jezreel Valley, HagGoshrim in the Upper Galilee, Beyt Nir in the Negev, etc.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

These processes have created the "renewing kibbutz" (הקיבוץ המתחדש )—a kibbutz settlement pattern not fully based on the original values of the kibbutz. Kibbutzim continuing under the original kibbutz values are associated with the "collaborative model" (הזרם השיתופי).

;New compensation models
There are now three kibbutz compensation models. 1) The traditional collective ''kibbutz/kibbutz shitufi'', in which members are compensated equally, regardless of what work each member does; 2) the mixed model ''kibbutz/kibbutz meshulav'', in which each member is given a small percentage of his salary along with a basic component given equally to all kibbutz members; and 3) the renewing ''kibbutz/kibbutz mithadesh'', in which a member's income consists solely of his individual income from his work and sometimes includes income from other kibbutz sources.&lt;ref name="kibbutz-changes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://israelity.com/2010/01/27/kibbutz-changes |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713063541/http://israelity.com/2010/01/27/kibbutz-changes/ |archivedate=2011-07-13 |df= }} Kibbutz changes, 27.1.2010&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a survey conducted by the [[University of Haifa]] 188 of all kibbutzim (72%) are now converted to the "renewing kibbutz" model, which could be described as more individualistic kibbutz. Dr. Shlomo Getz, head of the Institute for the Research of the Kibbutz and the Cooperative Idea believes that by the end of 2012, there will be more kibbutzim switching to some alternative model.&lt;ref name="kibbutz-changes"/&gt;

==Ideology of the kibbutz movement==
{{see also|Religious Kibbutz Movement|Settlement movement (Israel)}}
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 3290 Picking Cotton.jpg|thumb|250px|Cotton fields of kibbutz [[Shamir, Israel|Shamir]], ca. 1958]]
First Aliyah immigrants were largely religious, but those of the Second Aliyah were mainly secular. A Jewish work ethic thus replaced religious practice. [[Berl Katznelson]], a Labor Zionist leader articulated this when he said "Everywhere the Jewish labourer goes, [[Shekhinah|the divine presence]] goes with him."&lt;ref name=Segev255&gt;Segev, Tom. ''One Palestine, Complete: Jews and Arabs under the British Mandate''. Metropolitan Books, 2000, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the contemporary [[Yiddish]] [[Anti-Zionism|anti-Zionist]] literature that was circulating around Eastern Europe, Palestine was mocked as ''dos gepeygerte land'', "the country that had died".{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} Kibbutz members found immense gratification in bringing the land back to life by planting trees, draining swamps, and countless other hard-graft activities to make the land (invariably wetlands) productive.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} In soliciting donations, kibbutzim and other Zionist settlement activities presented themselves as "making the desert bloom".{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

The first kibbutzim were founded in the upper [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]], the [[Jezreel Valley]] and the [[Sharon]] [[coastal plain]]. The land was available for purchase because it was marshy and malaria-infested. The Zionists believed that the Arab population would be grateful for the economic benefits that developing the land would bring.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} Their approach was that the enemies of the Arab peasants were the Arab landowners (called ''[[effendi]]s''), not fellow Jewish farmers.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} The first kibbutzniks hoped to be more than farmers. They sought to create a new type of [[society]] where all would be equal and free from exploitation. {{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Kibbutz members were not classic Marxists though their system partially resembled [[Communism]]. [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] both shared a disdain for conventional formulations of the [[nation state]] and [[Leninism|Leninists]] were hostile to Zionism. Nevertheless, in the late 1930s, two kibbutz leaders, Tabenkin and Yaari, initially attracted to anarchist ideas,&lt;ref&gt;See James Horrox, ''A Living Revolution: Anarchism in the Kibbutz Movement'', Oakland: AK Press 2009. Ch. 3&lt;/ref&gt; pushed their movements to reverence of Stalin's dictatorship and of Stalin whom many called Shemesh HaAmim ("The Sun of the Nations").

The [[USSR]] voted at the [[UN]] for establishment of Israel. When it became apparent that Israel would not turn Communist Stalin became hostile to Israel and the USSR served diplomatic and military interests in the [[Arab world]]. This caused major crises and mass exit in both Kibbutz Meuchad and Kibbutz Artzi kibbutzim, especially after the 1952 [[Rudolf Slánský]] Prague show trials in which most of the accused and executed party functionaries were Jews and the 1953 [[Doctors' plot]] in Moscow of mostly Jews. Nonetheless many kibbutzim cancelled [[Purim]] celebrations when Stalin collapsed on March 1, 1953. Despite Communist atrocities and increasing state antisemitism in the USSR and its satellites many in the far left kibbutz movement, like [[Hashomer Hatzair]] (The Young Guard) viewed Stalin with awe and leader of the "peace camp". The party paper [[Al HaMishmar]] (On the Watch) presented this view.

Kibbutzim were run as collective enterprises within Israel's partly [[free market]] system. Internally kibbutzim also practiced active democracy, with elections held for kibbutz functions and full participation in national elections in which the members generally voted along the lines of the kibbutz movement ideology. Jewish religious practices were banned or discouraged in many far left kibbutzim.

Kibbutzim were not the only contemporary communal enterprises: pre-war Palestine also saw the development of communal villages called [[moshav]]im. In a moshav, marketing and major farm purchases were collective, but other aspects of life were private. {{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

In 2009, most votes from kibbutzim went to [[Kadima]], [[Israeli Labor Party|Labor]], and [[Meretz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Doron Shiner |date=11 February 2009 |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/how-they-voted-see-israel-election-results-by-city-sector-1.269923 |title=How They Voted: See Israel election results by city/sector |publisher=Haaretz |accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Communal life ==
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 7369 Gan - Samuel - 1953 - Temporary diningroom.jpg|thumb|Temporary dining room at [[Gan Shmuel]], 1953]]The principle of equality was taken extremely seriously up until the 1970s. Kibbutzniks did not individually own tools, or even clothing. Gifts and income received from outside were turned over to the common treasury. If a member received a gift in services—like a visit to a relative or a trip abroad paid for by a parent—there could be arguments at members' meetings about the propriety of accepting such a gift.&lt;ref name="Spiro Kibbutz"&gt;Spiro, Melford E. ''Kibbutz Venture in Utopia''. New York: Schocken, 1963. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Up until recently, members ate meals together in the communal dining hall. This was seen as an important aspect of communal life.

===Children===
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 6009 Gan-Shmuel sh1- 14.jpg|thumb|250px|Children of Kibbutz [[Gan Shmuel]], 1998]]
When the first children were born at the kibbutz there were inevitably some ethical dilemmas that needed to be solved. One of these was that the kibbutz was striving for equality, including the equality of the sexes. Women were only seen as separate because they gave birth to children, automatically tying them to the [[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]]. In order to liberate women and promote gender equality, they could not be tied to solely domestic duties and child care giving. The Kibbutz wanted to give women the opportunity to continue their work in the agricultural sector and industrial sector.&lt;ref name="Full Circle"&gt;Rothman, Paul, dir. ''Full Circle: The Ideal of a Sexually Egalitarian Society on the Kibbutz''. 1995. Filmmakers Library, 1995. Videocassette.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, "Communal education is the first step towards woman's liberation." Chayuta Bussel

Along with gender equality, the issue of parenting under the communal way of life was a concern. The parental tendency is to view the child as a personal possession and to dominate them. The founding members of the kibbutz agreed that this was not conducive to community life. They also thought it was selfish of parents to want to control their children and that this did not give room for the child to grow as their own person.&lt;ref name="Full Circle" /&gt;

To solve these issues the founders created the communal children's houses, where the children would spend most of their time; learning, playing and sleeping. Parents spent three to four hours a day in the afternoon with their children after work and before dinner.&lt;ref name="Spiro Kibbutz" /&gt;

Collective childrearing was also a way to escape the patriarchal society that the founders came from. Children would not be dependent on their fathers economically, socially, legally or otherwise and this would eliminate the father's authority and uproot the patriarchy.&lt;ref name="Spiro"&gt;{{cite book |last=Spiro |first=Melford E. |title=Kibbutz: Venture in Utopia |edition=4th |location=New York |publisher=Schocken |year=1970 |isbn=0-8052-0063-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the children's houses, trained [[nurse]]s and teachers were the care givers. It was felt that relationships of the children and their parents would be better because parents would not have to be the sole [[disciplinarian]]s. Children grew up in the community environment and grew up with children who were born in the same year as them. The financial responsibility of the children was shared by the community.

The founders of the Kibbutz sought a dynamic education for their children, that can be summed up in this statement from the founders of [[Degania Alef|Kibbutz Degania]]&lt;ref name="The Kibbutz Experience"&gt;{{cite book |last=Criden |first=Yosef |first2=Saadia |last2=Gelb |title=The Kibbutz Experience |location=New York |publisher=Schocken |year=1974 |isbn=0-8052-0511-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;From formal education to knowledge acquired from life, From the book to the physical work. From a discipline based on blind obedience to a regime of activity and creation in an atmosphere of freedom.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The adults in the community did their best to make the children's house into a children's home. They fully furnished them to accommodate every age group. "It is surrounded by a courtyard, well equipped for the growing child's needs, with flowers and bushes, hiding places, and playgrounds."&lt;ref name="Spiro Kibbutz" /&gt;

Under Freud's influence, the importance of the early years of childhood development were understood by the Kibbutz and much emphasis was put on fostering the child's sense of individuality, creativity, and basic trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=S. |last=Golan |chapter=Upbringing in the Family, in Institutions and the Kibbutz |title=Sugiot |location=Tel Aviv |publisher=SifriatPoalim |year=1956 |page=308. H }}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice transmission of family traditions and views was replaced by indoctrination into kibbutz and kibbutz movement views and also resulted in much uniformity vs. individuality. Significantly, this method of child rearing was not only "collectivization" of children, but a near complete conscious break with a cornerstone of Jewish life: focus on [[family]], especially the nuclear family.

Although, for many of the original founders of the Kibbutz, the arrival of children was a sobering experience: "When we saw our first children in the playpen, hitting one another, or grabbing toys just for themselves, we were overcome with anxiety. What did it mean that even an education in communal life couldn't uproot these egotistical tendencies? The utopia of our initial social conception was slowly, slowly destroyed."&lt;ref name=Segev254&gt;{{cite book |last=Segev |first=Tom |title=One Palestine, Complete: Jews and Arabs under the British Mandate |location= |publisher=Metropolitan Books |year=2000 |page=254 |isbn=0-8050-4848-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Child rearing====
{{see also|Kibbutz communal child rearing and collective education}}
From the 1920s until the 1970s, most kibbutzim had a system whereby the children would sleep in communal children's homes, called 'Beit Yeladim' (בית ילדים), instead of in their parents' apartments.

[[File:PikiWiki Israel 161 Kibbutz Babies החינוך המשותף.jpg|thumb|Kibbutz Babies]]
Although the children were not raised directly by their parents, they knew who their parents were and formed close bonds with them. Throughout the morning, parents looked forward to the end of the work day when they could go to the children's house and pick up the children to play with them and dote on them.&lt;ref name="Spiro" /&gt;

Children's societies were one of the features of kibbutz life that most interested outsiders. In the heyday of children's societies, parents would only spend two hours a day, typically in the afternoon, with their children. In Kibbutz Artzi parents were explicitly forbidden to put their children to bed at night. As children got older, parents could go for days on end without seeing their offspring, other than through chance encounters somewhere in the grounds.

Some children who went through children's societies said they loved the experience, others remain ambivalent. One vocal group maintains that growing up without one's parents was very difficult. Years later, a kibbutz member described her childhood in a children's society:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Allowed to suckle every four hours, left to cry and develop our lungs, we grew up without the basic security needed for survival. Sitting on the potty at regular intervals next to other children doing the same, we were educated to be the same; but we were, for all that, different.... At night the grownups leave and turn off all the lights. You know you will wet the bed because it is too frightening to go to the lavatory."&lt;ref name="Gavron168"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gavron |first=Daniel |title=The Kibbutz: Awakening from Utopia |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |location=Lanham |year=2000 |page=168 |isbn=0-8476-9526-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Examples of children raised under the Kibbutz system of equality are given by Yosef Criden. When an aunt from a nearby city comes to visit her niece or nephew and brings a box of chocolate as a present for them, the child will excitedly open it up and eat a few of the chocolates. Then the child will go over to the rest of the group and give the rest of the chocolates to their peers. This is the ideology instilled in the children, to value the self but also to always think about others. Another example Yosef gives is that when his son, who was born and raised on a kibbutz, went into the army, he and his fellow bunk mates asked their supervising officer for a box. They wanted to keep the box in the middle of the room and whenever they would get care packages, they would put the items into the box and share them communally. They did not want to be like most of the units of officers from towns and cities, where each officer would hide their packages under their beds.

In a 1977 study, Fox{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} compared the separation effects experienced by kibbutz children when removed from their mother, compared with removal from their [[caregiver]] (called a ''metapelet'' in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]). He found that the child showed separation distress in both situations but, when reunited, children were significantly more attached to their mothers than to the ''metapelet''. The children protested subsequent separation from their mothers when the ''metapelet'' was reintroduced to them. However, kibbutzim children shared high bonding with their parents as compared to those who were sent to [[boarding school]]s, because children in a kibbutz spent three to four hours with their parents every day.

In another study by Scharf, the group brought up in a [[communal]] environment within a kibbutz showed less ability in coping with imagined situations of separation than those who were brought up with their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Scharf |first=M. |title=A ‘Natural Experiment’ in Childrearing Ecologies and Adolescents' Attachment and Separation Representations |journal=Child Development |year=2001 |volume=72 |issue=1 |pages=236–251 |doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00276 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has far reaching implications for child attachment adaptability and therefore institutions like kibbutzim. These interesting kibbutz techniques are controversial with or without these studies.

A mixture of criticism and nostalgia by some 20 adults born in Kibbutzim in the 1930s was documented in the 2007 film ''[[Children of the Sun (2007 film)|Children of the Sun]]''. The film raised much controversy and brought about a flood of reactions in favor and against the practices of child raising in Kibbutzim in those early years of the Kibbutz. Interviews were interlaced with original footage.

====Higher education====
In the beginning, higher education was not valued as very important to the Kibbutz as most of the work was in agriculture. As the kibbutz changed and moved towards manufacturing and industry, more young people went to universities and colleges to pursue higher education. The total percentage of members studying at universities among kibbutz students rose from 38 percent in 1978 to 54 percent [in 1990].&lt;ref&gt;Rosner, Menachem, et al. ''The Second Generation Continuity and Change in the Kibbutz''. Westport: Greenwood, 1990. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally the Kibbutz paid college tuition in full, but in the 1980s with the kibbutz crisis, some began to pay a smaller share of tuition costs.

=== Gender equality ===
The role of gender equality on the kibbutz is very complex and has gone through cycles since the founding of the first kibbutzim. Since there were many different kibbutzim, women had different experiences at each particular one. Some say that women were and are completely equal to men on the kibbutz while others insist there has always been inequality.
[[File:Flickr - Government Press Office (GPO) - A woman working in the orange grove of kibbutz Na'an.jpg|thumb|A woman working in the orange grove of kibbutz Na'an]]
In the early days of the movement, kibbutzim tended to be male-dominated with significantly more male members. Nevertheless, women performed many of the same tasks as men. Both men and women worked in the fields, performed guard duty, and heavy labor.&lt;ref name="The Kibbutz Experience" /&gt; However, mostly women filled the traditional female roles, such as cooking, sewing, and cleaning.

In the first couple of decades there was no traditional marriage in the kibbutz. If a man and woman wanted to get married, they went to the housing office and requested a room together. Not having traditional marriage was seen as a way to dissolve the patriarchy and give women their own standing without depending on a man (economically or socially) and was also viewed as a positive thing for the community as a whole, as communal life was the main aspect of the kibbutz.

When the first children were born at the kibbutz, the founders were worried that this would tie the women to domestic service. They thought that the only difference between a man and a woman was that women gave birth and thus were automatically tied to the children and domestic duties. The communal dining and laundry were already a part of the kibbutz from the start. Of course they were implemented for reasons of living communally, but also to emancipate women from these duties so they were free to work in other sectors. With the arrival of the children, it was decided that they would be raised communally and sleep communally to free women to work in other fields. The desire to liberate women from traditional maternal duties was an ideological underpinning of the children's society system. Women were "emancipated from the yoke of domestic service" in that their children were taken care of, and the laundry and cooking was done communally.

Women born on kibbutzim were much less reluctant to perform traditional female roles. Eventually most women gravitated towards the service sector. The second generation of women who were born on the kibbutz eventually got rid of the children's houses and the Societies of Children. Most found that although they had a positive experience growing up in the children's house, wanted their own children at home with them.&lt;ref name="Full Circle" /&gt;

The documentary 'Full Circle' summarizes the change in the women's view of equality on the kibbutz. The original [[Utopia]]n goal of the founders was complete [[gender equality]]. Children lived in the children's houses. Freed from domestic duties, women participated in the industrial, agricultural and economic sectors alongside men. However, in the 1960s, while the rest of the Western world demanded equality of the sexes and embraced feminism, the second generation of kibbutz born women began to return to more traditional gender roles. They rejected the ideal achieved by their grandparents and returned to domestic duties such as cooking, cleaning and taking care of children. Today, most women do not participate in the economic and industrial sectors of the kibbutz. They even embraced traditional marriage.

Another example of the change in the original egalitarian nature of the kibbutz is that the founders of the kibbutz did not use the traditional Hebrew word for husband, ''ba'al'' (בעל, BAH-al), because the word is otherwise used to mean "master" or "owner" and implies that the wife is submissive to her dominant spouse. The granddaughters of the founders use ba'al for husband to their grandmother's disgust.{{POV statement|date=September 2015}} The granddaughters insist the grandparents are too caught up with terminology. The original egalitarian principles of gender equality have been compromised.&lt;ref name="Full Circle" /&gt;

Statistical data proves that the majority of women work in the service and domestic sectors while men work in the production sector. According to data from the 1940s, gender equality existed neither in the domain of work nor in the area of politics in the kibbutzim of the time. For instance, in 1948, in eight kibbutzim of the Ihud, a kibbutz federation with a pragmatic socialist orientation, 78.3 percent of the women worked in services (services for adults, child care, education) as compared with 16.7 percent of the men. That same year, 15.2 percent of the women worked in production as distinct from 58.2 percent of the men. The situation was the same in political life.&lt;ref&gt;Tiger and Shepher, 1975; Spiro, 1979; Palgi et al., 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1979, only 9 percent of the women were engaged in some type of farming activity. "[In 1979] only 12 percent of the female labor force is permanently assigned to productive branches, compared to 50 percent in 1920." Females comprise 84 percent of the service workers and the educational workers.

Also, although there was a "[[Gender role#Changingroles|masculinization of women]]" at one point, there was no corresponding "[[Feminization (sociology)|feminization]]" of men. Women may have worked the fields, but men did not work in [[childcare]].

=== Social life ===
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 3560 Architecture of Israel.jpg|thumb|250px|The dining hall in Kibbutz [[Merom Golan]], ca. 1968–1972]]
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 802 Kibutz Gan-Shmuel bs9- 65 גן-שמואל-חג הביכורים 1959.jpg|thumb|250px|Kibbutz [[Gan Shmuel]] on [[Shavuot]], 1959]]
Along with property and ideology, social lives were also held in common. As an example, most kibbutz dining halls exclusively utilized benches, not as an issue of cost or convenience, but because benches were construed as another way of expressing communal values. In the beginning, some kibbutzim husbands and wives were discouraged from sitting together, as marriage was an expressed form of exclusivity.
In ''The Kibbutz Community and Nation Building,'' Paula Rayman reports that Kibbutz Har refused to buy teakettles for its members in the 1950s; the issue being not the cost but that couples owning teakettles would mean more time spent together in their apartments, rather than with the community in the dining hall.

In the beginning, members were not allowed individual items, like teakettles and everything was strictly communal. Starting around the 1950s and 1960s, people were entitled to individual property, like teakettles, books, radios etc. According to Criden and Gelb "The equality problem only becomes serious when there are gross deviations from basic principles." Having a few books was fine, but having a private car was unacceptable. Items like cars were communally owned and had to be requested in advance by members or used for work related duties.&lt;ref name="The Kibbutz Experience" /&gt;

Communal life proved hard for some. Every kibbutz saw some new members quit after a few years. Since kibbutzniks had no individual bank accounts, any purchase not made at the kibbutz canteen had to be approved by a committee, a potentially humiliating and time-wasting experience.
Kibbutzim also had their share of members who were not hard workers, or who abused common property; there would always be resentment against these "parasites". Although according to Criden and Gelb, the vast majority of people on kibbutzim are not free-loaders. They state that their chief weapon against free-loaders is public opinion. People who do not pull their own weight in the community are frowned upon and their opinions are not taken seriously by the community and they are not given any responsibility.
Finally, kibbutzim, as small, isolated communities, tended to be places of gossip, exacerbated by lack of privacy and the regimented work and leisure schedules.

Although major decisions about the future of the kibbutz were made by consensus or by voting, day-to-day decisions about where people would work were made by elected leaders. Typically, kibbutzniks would learn their assignments by consulting the duty sheet at the dining hall.

Kibbutz memoirs from the Pioneer era report that kibbutz meetings varied from heated arguments to free-flowing philosophical discussions, whereas memoirs and accounts from kibbutz observers from the 1950s and 1960s report that kibbutz meetings were businesslike but poorly attended.

Kibbutzim attempted to rotate people into different jobs. One week a person might work in planting, the next with livestock, the week after in the kibbutz factory and the following week in the laundry. Even managers would have to work in menial jobs.&lt;ref&gt;See [[balanced job complex]] for related job rotations.&lt;/ref&gt; Through rotation, people took part in every kind of work, but it interfered with any process of specialization.

Aversion to sex was not part of the kibbutz ideology; to this end, teenagers were not segregated at night in children's societies, yet many visitors to kibbutzim were astonished at how conservative the communities tended to be. In ''Children of the Dream'', [[Bruno Bettelheim]] quoted a kibbutz friend, "at a time when the American girls preen themselves, and try to show off as much as possible sexually, our girls cover themselves up and refuse to wear clothing that might show their breasts or in any other fashion be revealing."
Kibbutz divorce rates were and are extremely low.&lt;ref name=Bettelheim243&gt;[[Bruno Bettelheim|Bettelheim, Bruno]]. ''The Children of the Dream'', Simon &amp; Schuster, 2001, p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately from the point of view of the adults in the community, marriage rates among communally raised children were equally low. This conservatism on the part of kibbutz children has been attributed to the [[Westermarck effect]]—a form of reverse sexual imprinting whereby even unrelated children, if raised together from an early age, tend to reject each other as potential partners. The children who grew up together in the children's houses considered their peers brothers and sisters and had close lasting bonds with each other.

From the beginning, kibbutzim had a reputation as culture-friendly and nurturing of the arts. Many kibbutzniks became writers, actors, or artists. Kibbutzim typically offer theatre companies, choirs, orchestras, athletic leagues, and special-interest classes. In 1953 [[Givat Brenner]] staged the play ''My Glorious Brothers,'' about the [[Maccabee]] revolt, building a real village on a hilltop as a set, planting real trees, and performing for 40,000 people. Following kibbutz work practices of the time, all the actors were members of the kibbutz, and all performed as part of their work assignments.

=== Crime ===
Although there have been sensational crimes on kibbutzim, overall the crime rate is lower than the national average by a significant margin.&lt;ref&gt;Gavron, Daniel. [https://books.google.com/books?id=5wifOjaA2BoC&amp;pg=PA160 ''The Kibbutz: Awakening from Utopia'']. Lanham, Md.: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2000. {{ISBN|978-0-8476-9526-3}} p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological aspects==

===Emotional involvement===
Three researchers who wrote about psychological life on kibbutzim were [[Melford E. Spiro]] (1958), [[Bruno Bettelheim]] (1969) and Michael Baizerman (1963). All concluded that a kibbutz upbringing led to individuals' having greater difficulty in making strong emotional commitments thereafter, such as [[falling in love]] or forming a lasting friendship. On the other hand, they appear to find it easier to have a large number of less-involved friendships, and a more active [[Interpersonal relationship|social life]].

Some researchers came to the conclusion that children growing up in these tightly knit communities tended to see the other children around them as [[ersatz]] siblings and preferred to [[exogamy|seek mates outside the community]] when they reached maturity. Some theorize that living amongst one another on a daily basis virtually from birth on produced an extreme version of the [[Westermarck effect#Westermarck effect|Westermarck effect]], which diminished teenage kibbutzniks' sexual attraction to one another. Partly as a result of not finding a mate from within the kibbutz, youth often abandon kibbutz life as adults.

===Private property===
The era of independent Israel kibbutzim attracted interest from [[sociologist]]s and [[psychologist]]s who attempted to answer the question: What are the effects of life without [[private property]]? What are the effects of life being brought up apart from one's parents?

Bettelheim suggested that the lack of private property was the cause of the lack of emotions in kibbutzniks. He wrote, "nowhere more than in the kibbutz did I realize the degree to which private property, in the deep layers of the mind, relates to private [[emotion]]s. If one is absent, the other tends to be absent as well". (See [[primitivism]] and [[primitive communism]] for a general discussion of these concepts).

===Group pressure to conform===
In Kibbutz life, group pressure to conform is particularly strong.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Douglas (1983) [https://books.google.com/books?id=ghkOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA88&amp;lpg=PA88 ''Groups: Understanding People Gathered Together''] pp. 87–8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Noam Chomsky (2003) [https://books.google.com/books?id=IUGomzBPBi4C&amp;pg=PA197 ''Understanding Power''] ch. 6 p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; It is a subject of debate within the kibbutz movement as to how successful kibbutz education was in developing the talents of gifted children. Several kibbutz-raised children look back and say that the communal system stifled ambition; others{{who|date=September 2012}} say that bright children were nonetheless encouraged.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Bruno Bettelheim had predicted that kibbutz education would yield mediocrity: "[kibbutz children] will not be leaders or philosophers, will not achieve anything in science or art." However, it has been noted that although kibbutzim comprise only 5% of the Israeli population, surprisingly large numbers of kibbutzniks become teachers, lawyers, doctors, and political leaders.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

In the 1990s, a [[journalist]] tracked down the children Bettelheim had interviewed back in the 1960s at "Kibbutz Atid" (now called [[Ramat Yohanan|Kibbutz Ramat Yohanan]]). The journalist found that the children were highly accomplished in [[academia]], [[business]], [[music]], and the [[military]]. "Bettelheim got it totally wrong."&lt;ref name=Gavron166&gt;Gavron, Daniel. ''The Kibbutz: Awakening from Utopia'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield, Lanham, 2000, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics==
Kibbutzim in the early days tried to be self-sufficient in all agricultural goods, from eggs to dairy to fruits to meats, but realized this was not possible. Land was generally provided by the [[Jewish National Fund]]. Later, they became dependent on government subsidies.

Even before the establishment of the State of Israel, kibbutzim began to branch out from [[agriculture]] into [[manufacturing]]. [[Degania Alef|Kibbutz Degania Alef]] opened a factory for [[diamond cutting]] tools that came to have a gross turnover of several US million dollars a year. [[Hatzerim|Kibbutz Hatzerim]] has a factory for [[drip irrigation]] equipment. [[Netafim]] is a multinational corporation that grosses over $300 million a year. [[Maagan Michael]] branched out from making bullets to making plastics and medical tools, and running an [[ulpan]]. These enterprises bring in over US$100 million a year. A great wave of kibbutz industrialization came in the 1960s, and {{As of|2012|lc=on}} only 15% of kibbutz members worked in agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.communa.org.il/e-israel.htm |title=The Communal Scene in Israel |accessdate=2012-12-13 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010123618/http://www.communa.org.il/e-israel.htm |archivedate=October 10, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hiring seasonal workers was always a point of controversy in the kibbutz movement. During harvest time, when hands were needed, labourers were sought outside the kibbutz. The founders of the kibbutz movement wanted to redeem the Jewish nation through manual labour, and hiring non-Jews to do hard tasks was not consistent with that idea. In the 1910s Kibbutz Degania vainly searched for Jewish masons to build their homes, but could not find Jewish [[stonemason]]s, and hired Arabs.

In the 1970s kibbutzim frequently hired Arab labourers. From the 1990s, teams of foreign workers were brought in, many from Thailand and China.

Kibbutzim have branched out into tourism, among them [[Kiryat Anavim]], [[Lavi]] and [[Nahsholim]]. Many kibbutzim rent out homes or run guesthouses. Several kibbutzim, such as Kibbutz [[Lotan]] and [[Kfar Ruppin]], operate bird-watching vacations and eco tours.  These tours showcase their development of sustainable technologies such as mud huts and compostable toilets.

Today, some Kibbutzim operate major industrial ventures. For example, in 2010, [[Kibbutz Sasa]], containing some 200 members, generated $850 million in annual revenue from its military-plastics industry.&lt;ref name="fastcompany.com"/&gt;  Kibbutz Ketura is leading Israel's development of solar technology, becoming a popular eco tourism attraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pomegranate-travel.com/ecological-tours-in-israel/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161113232044/http://www.pomegranate-travel.com/ecological-tours-in-israel/ |archivedate=2016-11-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of kibbutzim ==
There are three kibbutz movements:
# The [[Kibbutz Movement]], which constitutes an umbrella organization of two separate movements and ideologies: the United Kibbutz Movement, founded in 1979 as a merger of two older movements: the United Kibbutz and Union of Kvutzot and Kibbutzim, and [[Kibbutz Artzi]] [[Hashomer Hatzair]]
# [[Religious Kibbutz Movement]] [[Hapoel HaMizrachi]],
# [[Poalei Agudat Yisrael]]

Many kibbutzim were initially established by [[Nahal]] groups affiliated with Israeli youth movements, among them [[HaNoar HaOved VeHaLomed]], [[Hashomer Hatzair]] and HaMachanot HaOlim.

Following many changes the kibbutzim went through during the years and following the appeal made to Israeli High Court of Justice by the [[Mizrahi Democratic Rainbow Coalition]] in 2001 in which the state was required to redefine the exact definition of a kibbutz in order to define the rightful benefits the kibbutzim members should be granted by law. The reactivated legal definition was given to the [[Industry, Trade and Labour Minister of Israel]] on the December 15, 2005 (תקנות סיווג הקיבוצים). According to this classification there are three types of kibbutzim:
# '''Kibbutz Shitufi''' (קיבוץ שיתופי): a kibbutz still preserving a cooperative system.
# '''Kibbutz MitChadesh''' (קיבוץ מתחדש): a community with a number of cooperative systems in its intentions (guaranteed minimal income within the community, partnership in the ownership of the production means, partnership in the ownership of the lands, etc.).
# '''[[Urban kibbutz]]''' (קיבוץ עירוני): a community existing within an existing settlement (city). Since the 1970s around 100 [[urban kibbutz]]im have been founded within existing [[List of cities in Israel|Israeli cities]]. They have no enterprises of their own and all of their members work in the non-kibbutz sector.&lt;ref&gt;''The Jewish Advocate'', 7 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include [[Tamuz (kibbutz)|Tamuz]] in Beit Shemesh (near Jerusalem); Horesh in [[Kiryat Yovel]], Jerusalem; Beit Yisrael in [[Gilo]], Jerusalem&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reut.org.il/ Official Website Beit Yisrael]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Migvan]] in [[Sderot]].

==Legal reforms==
Some kibbutzim have been involved in legal actions related to their status as kibbutzim. Kibbutz [[Glil Yam]], near Herzliya, petitioned the court regarding privatization. In 1999, eight members of kibbutz [[Beit Oren]] applied to the High Court of Justice to order the registrar of cooperative societies to declassify Beit Oren as a kibbutz and reclassify it as a different kind of cooperative society. The petitioners argued that the Kibbutz had dramatically changed its life style, having implemented differential salaries, closing the communal dining room, and privatizing the educational system and other services. These changes did not fit the legal definition of a kibbutz, and in particular, the principle of equality in consumption. Consequently, the registrar of cooperative societies, who has the authority to register and classify cooperative societies, should change the classification of kibbutz Beit Oren. The kibbutz responded that it still maintained the basic principles of a kibbutz, but the changes made were vital to prevent a financial collapse and to improve the economic situation.&lt;ref name="FreidOne"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Freid|first1=Stephanie|title=All for One|url=http://search.proquest.com/news/docview/321095389/fulltext/A06F835847D84AF7PQ/1?accountid=10226|accessdate=10 August 2016|publisher=Jerusalem Post|date=30 April 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BrinkleyKibbutzDebt"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brinkley|first1=Joel|title=Debts Make Israelis Rethink an Ideal: The Kibbutz|url=http://search.proquest.com/news/docview/427140244/fulltext/A06F835847D84AF7PQ/7?accountid=10226|accessdate=10 August 2016|publisher=[[New York Times]]|date=5 March 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This case resulted in the Government establishing the "Ben-Rafael Committee" chaired by [[Tel Aviv University]] professor [[Eliezer Ben-Rafael]] to recommend a new legal definitions that will suit the development of the kibbutz, and to submit an opinion on the allocation of apartments to kibbutz members. The committee submitted a detailed report with two new legal classifications to the settlements known today as kibbutzim. The first classification was named 'communal kibbutz', identical to the traditional definition of a kibbutz. The second classification was called the 'renewing kibbutz' and included developments and changes in lifestyle, provided that the basic principles of mutual guarantee and equality are preserved. In light of the above, the committee recommended that instead of the current legal definition of kibbutz, two different determinations will be created, as follows, a) ''communal kibbutz'': a society for settlement, being a separate settlement, organized on the basis of collective ownership of possession, of self-employment, and of equality and cooperation in production, consumption and education, b) ''renewing kibbutz'': a society for settlement, being a separate settlement, organized on the basis of collective partnership in possession, of self-employment, and of equality and cooperation in production, consumption and education, that maintains mutual guarantee among its members, and its articles of association includes, some or all of the following:
* relative wages according to the individual contribution or to seniority allocation of apartments
* allocation of productive means to its members, excluding land, water
* productive quotas, provided that the cooperative society will maintain control over the productive means and that the articles of association restrict the negotiability of allocated productive means.
The recommendations were accepted by [[Cabinet of Israel]] in 2004.&lt;ref name="WagnerKibbutz"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wagner|first1=Mati|title=Kibbutzim to Adopt Capitalism|url=http://search.proquest.com/news/docview/319423418/fulltext/B90147AE323A4632PQ/1?accountid=10226|accessdate=10 August 2016|publisher=[[Jerusalem Post]]|date=30 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In his history of Palestine under the British Mandate, ''One Palestine, Complete'', "[[New Historian]]" [[Tom Segev]] wrote of the kibbutz movement:

:The kibbutz was an original social creation, yet always a marginal phenomenon. By the end of the 1920s no more than 4,000 people, children included, lived on some thirty kibbutzim, and they amounted to a mere 2.5% of Palestine's Jewish population. The most important service the kibbutzim provided to the Jewish national struggle was military, not economic or social. They were guardians of Zionist land, and their patterns of settlement would to a great extent determine the country's borders. The kibbutzim also had a powerful effect on the Zionist self-image.&lt;ref name=Segev252&gt;Segev, Tom. ''One Palestine, Complete: Jews and Arabs under the British Mandate''. Metropolitan Books, 2000, p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt;

As against this characterization, numerous students found kibbutzim played major role in agricultural innovation that advanced the Israeli agriculture to leading the world in some sectors, for instance irrigation. In later era many of their factories led Israeli efforts to gain economic independence by production for export, while their political involvement was of major importance up to 1948. The Kibbutz Meuchad and Kibbutz Artzi menaced Ben-Gurion's dominance of Yishuv politics in the 1940s, but they failed gaining wide public support in Israeli elections ever since 1949 because of reverence of Stalin's dictatorship, which most Israelis denounced.&lt;ref name = "Near"&gt;Henry Near. ''The Kibbutz Movement: A History''. Vol. II - London: Littman Library, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Kibbutzim have been criticized for falling short of living up to their own ideals. Most kibbutzim are not self-sufficient and have to employ non-kibbutz members as farm workers (or later factory workers). What was particularly controversial was the employment of Arab labourers while excluding them from the possibility of joining the Kibbutz as full members.

Some kibbutzim have been criticized for "abandoning" socialist principles and turning to [[capitalism|capitalist]] projects in order to make the kibbutz more self-sufficient economically. [[Shamir (kibbutz)|Kibbutz Shamir]] owns an optical products company that is listed on the [[NASDAQ]] stock exchange. Numerous kibbutzim have moved away from farming and developed parts of their property for commercial and industrial purposes, building shopping malls and factories on kibbutz land that serve and employ non kibbutz members while the kibbutz retains a profit from land rentals or sales. Conversely, kibbutzim that have not engaged in this sort of development have also been criticized for becoming dependent on state subsidies to survive.

Nonetheless, kibbutzniks played a role in [[yishuv]] society and then Israeli society, far out of proportion to their population, and many kibbutzniks have served Israel in positions of leadership. The invention of the [[Tower and Stockade]] system by which 52 settlements from 1938 to 1947 largely decided the borders of Israel in the UN 29 November 1947 decision, is attributed to kibbutz member [[Shlomo Gur]].&lt;ref&gt;Rotbard, Sharon. ''Wall and Tower—The Mold of Israeli Adrikalut'' In: ''Territories'', [[Kunst-Werke Institute for Contemporary Art|KW - Institute for Contemporary Art]], Berlin, 2003, p. 162., {{ISBN|3-88375-734-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The establishment of the [[Palmach]] underground army in 1942, which won the yishuv crucial military struggle against Palestinian Arabs from 30 November 1947 up to 15 May 1948 that made possible the establishment of the Israeli state, was due to efforts by Tabenkin and other Kibbutz Meuchad leaders. One of them, [[Yigal Allon]] and Kibbutz Artzi member [[Shimon Avidan]] were the two most important commanders who won the 1948 war, and numerous kibbutz members were Cabinet Ministers who largely shaped Israeli politics from 1955 to 1977.&lt;ref name = "Near" /&gt; Kibbutz-born [[Ehud Barak]] was Prime Minister from 1999 to 2001, and [[David Ben-Gurion]] lived most of his life in Tel Aviv, but joined Kibbutz [[Sde Boker]] in the Negev after resigning as Prime Minister in 1953. He remained a member after his return to office in 1955.

Kibbutzim also contributed greatly to the growing Hebrew culture movement. The poet [[Rachel (poet)|Rachel]] rhapsodized on the landscape from viewpoints from various Galilee kibbutzim in the 1920s and 1930s. The kibbutz dream of "making the desert bloom" became part of the Israeli dream as well.

A '''labour code''', (also called a ''code of labour laws'') is a [[Codification (law)|codification]] of [[labour law]]s in legislative form.

One of the first labour codes was first introduced in 1918 in the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]], as a legal framework underlying the requirement to ensure the right to work declared in the first Soviet Constitution.&lt;ref name="KZOT-1918"&gt;[http://www.hist.msu.ru/Labour/Law/kodex_18.htm Кодекс законов о труде 1918 года] // Приложение из учебного пособия И. Я. Киселева «Трудовое право России» (Москва, 2001). — Собрание Узаконений и Распоряжений Рабочего и Крестьянского Правительства РСФСР. 1918; № 87–88. Ст. 905&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of [[World War II|post-war]] the labour codes basing upon the same set of social guarantees were introduced in [[German Democratic Republic]], [[People's Republic of Hungary]], [[People's Republic of Poland]] and the other socialist countries in Central and Eastern Europe.

Presently the Labour Code exists in [[Russia|Russian Federation]] and in some other former Soviet Republics.

In Canada the [[Canada Labour Code|Labour Code]] (R.S., 1985, c. L-2) was adopted in 1985 superseding the [[Industrial Relations and Disputes Investigation Act of 1948]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Canada Labour Code

On July 10, 1918 the [[:ru:V Всероссийский съезд Советов|5th All-Russian Congress of Soviets]] adopted the Constitution of Russia which declared the right and duty to work for all citizen.&lt;ref name="c1918"&gt;[http://vivovoco.astronet.ru/VV/LAW/1918_W.HTM Constitution of the R.S.F.S.R.

'''Logocracy''' is the rule of, or government by, words. It is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[Wiktionary:λόγος|λόγος]] ([[logos]])—"word" and from [[Wiktionary:κράτος|κράτος]] (kratos)—to "govern". The term can be used either positively, ironically, or negatively.

==Historical examples==
The [[United States]] is described as a logocracy in [[Washington Irving]]'s 1807 work, ''[[Salmagundi (periodical)|Salmagundi]]''. A visiting foreigner, "Mustapha Rub-a-dub Keli Khan", describes it as such, by which he means that via the tricky use of words, one can have power over others. Those most adept at this are termed "slang-whangers", while [[United States Congress|Congress]] is a "blustering, windy assembly".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kWIAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA77&amp;dq=logocracy&amp;lr=&amp;ei=HBfISMWNBITYyATkiPGiBA#PPA77,M1 ''Southern Quarterly Review'', Harvard, 1845, pp. 77-78]&lt;/ref&gt; Mustapha describes how:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"unknown to these people themselves, their government is a pure unadulterated LOGOCRACY or ''government of words''. The whole nation does every thing ''[[:wikt:viva voce|viva voce]]'', or, by word of mouth, and in this manner is one of the most military nations in existence [...] In a logocracy thou well knowest there is little or no occasion for [[fire arm]]s, or any such destructive weapons. Every offensive or defensive measure is enforced by ''wordy battle'', and ''paper war''; he who has the longest tongue or readiest [[quill]], is sure to gain the victory—will carry horrour [sic], abuse, and ''ink shed'' into the very trenches of the enemy, and without mercy or remorse, put men, women, and children to the point of the—pen!"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=XfQAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA309&amp;lpg=PA309&amp;dq=%22to+let+thee+at+once+into+a+secret%22+logocracy&amp;source=web&amp;ots=H7KyOq26XE&amp;sig=PWINaDMTzL95Ni4PvOGpPFGbNOA&amp;hl=pl&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPA310,M1 Joseph Dennie, John Elihu Hall, ''The Port Folio'', The Editor and Asbury Dickens, 1807, p. 309]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Soviet Union]] was described by [[Nobel Prize]] winner [[Czesław Miłosz]],&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kirkwood, ''Language Planning in the Soviet Union'', University of London School of Slavonic and East European Studies, University of London, 1989, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; as a logocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Alain Besançon agrees in: ''The Soviet Syndrome'', 1978, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; It was for example, according to Christine D. Tomei, a "pseudo-reality created by mere words".&lt;ref&gt;Christine D. Tomei, ''Russian Women Writers'', 1999, p. 1310&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, after the revolution [[Luciano Pellicani]] describes how a "language reform plan" was introduced by Kisselev. In it he "stressed that the old mentality would never be overthrown, if the structure of the Russian language was not also transformed and purged."

This process led to a Soviet language that [[George Orwell]] would later dub "neo-language", and was a precursor to his ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' [[Newspeak]].&lt;ref name=Pellicani&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IcUBSiTQu78C&amp;pg=PA233&amp;dq=logocracy+Orwell&amp;ei=vVDPSIWiD4zAzATKu7XiBA&amp;sig=ACfU3U0qxAOa4hPOcWodsYcEUZZGeZIwRA#PPA235,M1 Luciano Pellicani, ''Revolutionary Apocalypse: Ideological Roots of Terrorism'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 2003, pp.234-235]&lt;/ref&gt; The new Soviet 'language' was less a real language than an 'orthogloxy', a "stereotyped jargon consisting of formulas and empty [[slogans]], whose purpose was to prevent people from thinking outside the boundaries of collective thought"—i.e. it was speech which destroyed [[individuality]].&lt;ref name=Pellicani/&gt; Janina Frentzel-Zagórska, however, queries the importance of political language in the USSR, saying that "the old ideological 'Newspeak' had completely disappeared in the Soviet Union long before" the fall of [[Communism]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HkSylI-i4VsC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq=logocracy+soviet&amp;ei=RVDPSNXOKYGCywSQhJDiBA&amp;sig=ACfU3U3XlNdSxoL5MDyMvN5r3bQ36YS0ew Janina Frentzel-Zagórska, ''From a One-party State to Democracy: Transition in Eastern Europe'', Rodopi, 1993, p. 46]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Totalitarianism]], according to political theorist [[Hannah Arendt]], can be considered a logocracy, since in it [[idea]]s are no longer important, just how they are expressed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=tVUDAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Hannah+arendt%22+logocracy&amp;dq=%22Hannah+arendt%22+logocracy&amp;ei=UF_JSNK8NInaygTdw5C8DQ&amp;pgis=1 Quoted in: Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, ''Interchange'', SpringerLink, 1992, p. 29]&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic [[Nasreddin Lebatelier|Yahya Michot]] has referred to [[Sunni Islam]] as a "popular" or "laic logocracy", in that it is government by the word of the [[Koran]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=nljYZkgh4dQC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=logocracy&amp;lr=&amp;ei=BFrJSMqrNIyYyASm7NWTBA&amp;sig=ACfU3U3M8p1aLyrkCp-gwj02XZSzh-sGZA Quoted in: Paul Culp, ''Nothing New Under the Sun: An Introduction to Islam'', 2007, p. 43]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marxist Coordination Committee''' is a [[political party]] in [[Jharkhand]], [[India]]. MCC is based in the [[coal mining]] region of [[Dhanbad]].

Janwadi Kisan Sangram Samiti (Democratic Peasants Struggle Association) was formed after local communist leader [[A. K. Roy]] had been expelled from [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]]. JKSS later converted into MCC. MCC is still led by [[A. K. Roy]], who has been elected MP three times.

[[A. K. Roy]] was active in the [[Jharkhand movement]] and co-founder of [[Jharkhand Mukti Morcha]]. As [[Jharkhand Mukti Morcha]] developed into a political party, the relations soared.

In 1980, [[A. K. Roy]] then MP and [[K.S. Chatterjee]] a Member of [[Bihar Legislative Assembly]] were arrested under the [[National Security Act (India)|National Security Act]]. In total Roy has been jailed four times.

[[K.S.Chatterjee]] was elected to the [[Bihar Legislative Assembly]] twice as an Independent candidate. He joined the [[Indian National Congress]] and won in 1985 on a Congress ticket. He is a prominent Trade Union Leader in the [[Dhanbad]] region and is the President of [[Bihar Pradesh Colliery Mazdoor Congress]].

In 1998 the only Member of the [[Bihar Legislative Assembly]] of MCC, [[Gurudas Chatterjee]] was murdered by the [[coal mafia]]. Chatterjee's son [[Arup Chatterjee]] took over his mandate after a by-poll.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

'''Night flying restrictions''' are any regulations or [[legislation]] imposed by a governing body to limit the ground-perceived exposure to [[aircraft noise]] during the night hours, when the majority of residents are trying to sleep.  Such regulations may include restrictions to available flight paths, or prohibitions against takeoffs, or prohibitions against takeoffs and landings, or prohibitions against ground operations (engine runups or [[taxiing]]).

== European airports ==
[[Image:Nachtflugbeschraenkungen.jpg|thumb|Example: Night flying restrictions at German airports.]]

Night flying restrictions, commonly known as curfews, are common at airports in Europe.

=== London airports ===
The night restrictions for [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]], [[London Gatwick Airport|Gatwick]] and [[London Stansted Airport|Stansted]] define a night period, 2300–0700 hours, and a [[Quota Count system|night quota period]], 2330–0600 hours. During the night period, the noisiest types of aircraft (classified as QC/4, QC/8 or QC/16 under the [[Quota Count system]]) may not be scheduled to land or to take off (other than in the most exceptional circumstances, such as an [[emergency landing]].). In addition, during the night quota period movements by most other types of aircraft (including the new QC/0.25 category) will be restricted by a movements limit and a noise quota, which are set for each season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090607023527/http://www.dft.gov.uk/press/speechesstatements/statements/nightflyingrestrictionsathea5940 DfT statement]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===

Most airports in [[Germany]] have restrictions and curfews during the night. [[Frankfurt International Airport]], for example has a total ban on scheduled aircraft movements between 2300 and 0500 hours, and during the morning and evening periods (2200-2300 and 0500-0600) a limited number of flights are allowed, providing they comply with ICAO Chapter 4 noise regulations. Further restrictions apply to noisier aircraft. &lt;ref&gt;AIP Germany. Version 06/16 (2016, May 26). AD 2 EDDF 1-16 (2.20.2.1.4).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''One Wales''' ({{lang-cy|Cymru'n Un}}, {{IPA-cy|ˈkəmrɨn ˈɨn|pron}}) was the [[coalition agreement]] for the [[National Assembly for Wales]] between [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] and [[Plaid Cymru]] agreed to by [[Rhodri Morgan]], [[First Minister of Wales]] and leader of [[Welsh Labour]], and [[Ieuan Wyn Jones]], leader of Plaid Cymru, on 27 June 2007.&lt;ref name="BBC1"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/6245040.stm BBC NEWS | UK | Wales | Historic Labour-Plaid deal agreed&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It was negotiated in the wake of the [[National Assembly for Wales election, 2007|preceding National Assembly election]] which resulted in a large Labour [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]], but no [[majority]].

==History==

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Rhodri Morgan.jpg|thumb|125px|left|Rhodri Morgan, Labour leader and First Minister.]] --&gt;
On 3 May 2007, Labour won 26 of 60 seats in the 2007 [[National Assembly for Wales]] election, four short of an effective majority of 30 (see [[Speaker Denison's rule]] for an explanation of why this is so). Originally, commentators had predicted a Labour-[[Welsh Liberal Democrats]] coalition, after a previous coalition which had lasted from 2000 until 2003. Liberal Democrat leader [[Mike German]], who had served as [[Deputy First Minister of Wales]] in the previous coalition, favoured the deal, which would have given the Government a majority of four. However, concerns within his party about propping up a weakened Labour party prevented such an agreement. An alternative option, the so-called "rainbow coalition" of [[Plaid Cymru]], the Liberal Democrats and the [[Welsh Conservative Party|Conservatives]], was negotiated between the leaders of those parties in mid-May, but was rejected at a Liberal Democrat special conference vote on 23 May.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politics.guardian.co.uk/wales/story/0,,2088286,00.html Labour minority rule for Wales | Politics | guardian.co.uk&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The new Assembly formally opened two days later with no clear majority, and Rhodri Morgan was elected First Minister unopposed at the head of a [[minority government]].

After one month of minority government, talks between Ieuan Wyn Jones and Rhodri Morgan resulted in the One Wales agreement between Labour and Plaid Cymru,&lt;ref name="BBC1"/&gt; giving the Government a majority of 22. The agreement was criticised by some Labour members as too conciliatory towards Plaid Cymru's [[Welsh independence|nationalist]] leanings, especially in that it included a provision requiring a [[referendum]] on full law-making powers for the [[National Assembly for Wales]], in line with the [[Scottish Parliament]].&lt;ref name="BBC2"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/6248724.stm BBC NEWS | UK | Wales | Labour MPs worried by Plaid deal&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Labour party agreed to the plan by a wide margin on 6 July.&lt;ref name="BBC3"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/6275036.stm BBC NEWS | UK | Wales | Labour agrees historic coalition&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Plaid Cymru's membership approved the plan on 7 July.&lt;ref name="BBC4"/&gt; Negotiations on cabinet posts in the new government were scheduled to take place starting 9 July, but Morgan fell ill the night before.&lt;ref name="BBC6"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/6282468.stm BBC NEWS | UK | Wales | Rhodri Morgan has artery surgery&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, he had surgery to insert stents into on two partially blocked arteries. He was released from the hospital a few days later, and negotiations concluded on 19 July. Three Plaid Cymru AMs would serve as full ministers alongside six Labour members, with four deputy ministers from Labour and one from Plaid Cymru. The only Labour member to be struck from the government as a result of the deal was Deputy Economy and Transport Minister [[Huw Lewis]], who had previously opposed the One Wales deal.&lt;ref name="BBC6"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/6905218.stm BBC NEWS | UK | Wales | Labour assembly minister sacked&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010 Labour and Plaid Cymru AMs refused to cross the [[Public and Commercial Services Union|PCS union]] [[strike action|picket line]]. The [[First Minister for Wales|First Minister]] [[Carwyn Jones]] claimed that it was in the Welsh Labour party's political thinking not to cross a picket line. The [[Welsh Conservative Party]] and the [[Welsh Liberal Democrats]] condemned the One Wales government for not attending Assembly business.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/8583591.stm&lt;/ref&gt;

The first page of the agreement states that it "delivers a progressive, stable and ambitious programme for government
over this Assembly term." Under its terms, Ieuan Wyn Jones became Deputy First Minister and Rhodri Morgan remained First Minister. Other posts were divided up among members of the two parties by Morgan in consultation with Jones.

&lt;!-- [[Image:Plaid Cymru 2006logo.png|100px|right|thumb|Plaid Cymru's logo]] --&gt;
The key policy proposals of the deal focused on increasing the amount of affordable housing in Wales through various incentives and schemes; investing in a comprehensive rail programme to link [[North Wales]] and [[South Wales]] more effectively; instituting a moratorium on community hospital reforms and promising to "agree and implement a new approach to health service reconfiguration" when "there is a local agreement on the way forward"; a new commission to tackle [[climate change]] problems and [[alternative energy]] questions; and, most controversially, an agreement to hold a referendum on new [[Contemporary Welsh Law|law-making powers]] for the National Assembly in the vein of those previously granted to the Scottish Parliament. The text also stated that Plaid Cymru and Labour had agreed "in good faith to campaign for a successful outcome to such a referendum."&lt;ref name="BBC3"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/6272280.stm BBC NEWS | UK | Wales | Senior MPs condemn Plaid deal&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

This last section was criticised by Welsh Labour MPs [[Paul Murphy (UK politician)|Paul Murphy]], [[Don Touhig]], and [[Kim Howells]], Minister of State at the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]], who claimed it would lead "nationalists to the gates of independence."&lt;ref name="BBC7"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/6272280.stm BBC NEWS | UK | Wales | Senior MPs condemn Plaid deal&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The referendum was held on 3 March 2011. The outcome was 'yes', with 63.49% of the participants for and 36.51% against; 35.2% of the electorate participated.

==Analysis==
The agreement was seen variously as a first step towards independence,&lt;ref name="BBC7"/&gt; a sell-out on Plaid's part that propped up a Labour government,&lt;ref name="BBC8"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/betsanpowys/2007/07/on_the_move.html BBC NEWS | The Reporters | Betsan Powys&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and part of a wider shift towards [[nationalism]] in the [[British Isles]].&lt;ref name="Guardian2"&gt;[http://politics.guardian.co.uk/wales/comment/0,,2123500,00.html Michael White: Momentous day for nationalists | Comment is free | The Guardian&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; According to polling by the [[BBC]] in January 2007, only 20% of Welsh voters favoured independence,&lt;ref&gt;[http://independent-wales.blogspot.com/2007/03/creating-our-own-agenda.html Welsh Independence: Creating our Own Agenda&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; but 22.4% of Welsh voters supported Plaid Cymru &amp;mdash; just one of a number of nationalist parties and candidates in the 2007 Assembly election. This was put down to more general dissatisfaction with Labour's [[Tony Blair]] in the media,&lt;ref name="Guardian3"&gt;[http://politics.guardian.co.uk/wales/story/0,,2004833,00.html Blair not an issue in Wales, says first minister | Politics | guardian.co.uk&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that any growth in nationalist sentiment might have been less important to the electorate's shift away from Labour than [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]] political scandals.

==One Wales Delivery Plan 2007-2011==
The [[Welsh Government]] published the ''One Wales Delivery Plan 2007-2011'', setting out 228 specific commitments in ''One Wales'' to be delivered by April 2011. Each section of the plan included a vision statement and success criteria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://new.wales.gov.uk/about/strategy/strategypublications/strategypubs/1walesdeliveryplan/?lang=en Welsh Assembly Government | One Wales Delivery Plan 2007-2011&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3108">A '''peace commission''' is an organization that operates at a local, regional, or national level within a country to reduce, counter, or prevent conflict. Typically, a peace commission will involve local communities and individuals in the peace building process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A [[Truth and reconciliation commission]] is a form of Peace Commission that discovers and reveals past wrongdoings in the hope of resolving conflict left over from the past. The South African [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] is an example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |title=Welcome to the official Truth and Reconciliation Commission Website
 |publisher=Government of South Africa
 |accessdate=2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A commission such as the [[Southern Sudan Peace Commission]] is less concerned with the past, and more with finding ways to prevent ongoing ethnic violence from escalating, but instead to move towards a more peaceful society.&lt;ref name=pactworld&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.pactworld.org/cs/sudan/south_sudan_peace_norway
 |title=SSPC/Pact Sudan People to People Peace Building

 |accessdate=2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another sense for the term is a commission that represents a country negotiating the terms of a peace during or immediately after a war.

==Peace promotion==

Examples of peace commissions that promote the peace in unstable situations:

* [[Assessment and Evaluation Commission]], a commission in the [[Republic of the Sudan]] that monitors and supports the implementation of the [[Comprehensive Peace Agreement]]
* [[Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace in Zimbabwe]], established in 1972 to assist in cases of human rights abuse
* [[National Commission for Justice and Peace]], formed in 1985 by the Pakistan Catholic Bishops’ Conference
* [[Peacebuilding Commission]], established in December 2005 by the United Nations as an inter-governmental advisory body
* [[Southern Sudan Peace Commission]], established in 2006 to promote peace among the people of South Sudan.

==Peace negotiation==

Examples of peace commissions established to negotiate terms of peace:

* [[American Commission to Negotiate Peace]], delegation from the United States that participated in the peace negotiations at the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in 1919
* [[Arbitration Commission of the Peace Conference on Yugoslavia]], established in 1991 by the [[European Union]]
* [[Carlisle Peace Commission]], a group of British negotiators who were sent to North America in 1778, during the [[American Revolutionary War]]

The '''People's Constitutional Party''' was a [[political party]] active in the U.S. state of [[New Mexico]] during the late 1960s and early 1970s.

==History==
The party was formed in 1968 by supporters of [[Reies Tijerina]] and his [[Alianza Federal de Mercedes]], who was active in the [[Chicano Movement]] and advocated for [[Spanish land grants in New Mexico|land grants in New Mexico]] to be restored to descendants of their original Spanish and Mexican owners.&lt;ref name=correia&gt;{{cite book|author=David Correia|title=Properties of Violence: Law and Land Grant Struggle in Northern New Mexico|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WVN8AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA151|date=1 March 2013|publisher=University of Georgia Press|isbn=978-0-8203-4502-4|pages=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party, which was led by Pedro Arechuleta and Moises Morales, called for "[[bilingual education]], civilian police review boards, and an increase in [[welfare]] payments."&lt;ref name=correia/&gt; Due to his status as a convicted felon, Tijerina was disqualified as a gubernatorial candidate in the [[New Mexico gubernatorial election, 1968|1968 election]] and was replaced by Jose Maestes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=174482|title=NM Governor 1968|publisher=OurCampaigns|date=January 21, 2013|accessdate=December 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party ran several candidates in the 1968 and 1970 elections, but none were successful, or even received more than 2% of the vote,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/PartyDetail.html?PartyID=1606|title=People's Constitutional Party|publisher=Our Campaigns|date=February 12, 2010|accessdate=April 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it dissolved shortly afterward, largely due to Tijerina's imprisonment a year prior.&lt;ref name=correia/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Mexico's Fast-Paced Campaigns Drawing to Close at Polls Tuesday|last=Feather|first=Bill|newspaper=[[The Santa Fe New Mexican]]|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/211924010/|date=November 3, 1968|accessdate=December 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1970, the People's Constitutional Party had 169 registered members.&lt;ref name=pcpve&gt;{{cite court |litigants=People's Constitutional Party v.

For example, for a police department, the report might show the number of arrests, number of convictions by crime category and the change in the crime rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2_uH1dGf2mUC |title=Quality matters |author=Robert Schwartz, John Mayne | isbn=978-0-7658-0256-9 |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health care==
In the [[Clinton health care plan of 1993]], it seemed that performance reports for hospitals and other health care providers would be national policy and many prototypes were developed and tested.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |doi=10.1056/NEJM199507063330114 |title=Performance reports on quality--prototypes, problems, and prospects |author=A Epstein |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=333 |pages=57–61 |date=July 6, 1995 |pmid=7777000 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reginald Woodifield Appleby''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|VD|CBE}}, (1865 – 30 August 1948) was an English lawyer, practising in Bermuda, who in 1898 founded the predecessor of the law firm that now trades as [[Appleby (law firm)|Appleby]]. He served as a major in the Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps during the First World War and was a member of the Legislative Council of Bermuda.

==Early life and family==
Reginald Appleby was born at [[Portsea Island]], Hampshire, England, in 1865&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:2X94-W25 |title=Reginald Woodifield Appleby |website=Family Search |access-date=6 November 2017 |department=England and Wales Birth Registration Index}}&lt;/ref&gt; to George Walton Appleby of Durham and Agnes Sterry Tucker of Bermuda. His father was described in the [[1871 Census of the United Kingdom|1871 census]] as widowed and "Late Captain Landowner"&lt;ref name="1871cen"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:VFDV-FYW |title=George W Appleby |website=Family Search |access-date=6 November 2017 |department=England and Wales Census, 1871}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[1881 Census of the United Kingdom|1881]] as "Late Cpt 31st Regmt".&lt;ref name="1881cen"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:Q274-NDYC |title=George W Appleby |website=Family Search  |access-date=6 November 2017 |department=England and Wales Census, 1881}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reginald had three brothers and a sister.&lt;ref name="1871cen" /&gt;

The '''royalists''' were the [[Hispanic America|Latin American]] and [[Peninsulares|European]] supporters of the various governing bodies of the [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish Monarchy]], during the [[Spanish American wars of independence]], which lasted from 1808 until the king's death in 1833. In the early years of the conflict, when King [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] was captive in France, royalists supported the authority in the Americas of the [[Supreme Central and Governing Junta of the Kingdom (Spain)|Supreme Central Junta of Spain and the Indies]] and the [[Cádiz Cortes]] that ruled in the King's name during the [[Peninsular War]]. After the [[Mid-19th-century Spain#Reaction (1814–1820)|restoration of Ferdinand VII]] in 1814, royalists supported his claim to rule Spanish America, but were split between those that supported his insistence to rule under traditional law and [[Liberalism|liberals]], who sought to reinstate the reforms enacted by the Cádiz Cortes.

== Political evolution ==
[[File:FCNS1.svg|thumb|right|200px|Royalist territories in Western South America after the [[Battle of Chacabuco]] of 1818. [[Chiloé]] and [[Valdivia]] were royalist enclaves accessible only by sea.]]
The creation of [[junta (Peninsular War)|junta]]s in Spanish America in 1810 was a direct reaction to developments in Spain during the previous two years. In 1808 Ferdinand VII had been convinced to [[Abdications of Bayonne|abdicate]] by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] in his favor, who granted the throne to his brother, [[Joseph Bonaparte]]. The Supreme Central Junta had led a resistance to Joseph's government and the French occupation of Spain, but suffered a series of reverses resulting in the loss of the northern half of the country. On February 1, 1810, French troops took Seville and gained control of most of [[Andalusia]]. The Supreme Junta retreated to [[Cádiz|Cadiz]] and dissolved itself in favor of a Regency Council of Spain and the Indies. As news of this arrived throughout Spanish America during the next three weeks to nine months—depending on time it took [[History of transport|goods and people to travel]] from Spain—political fault lines appeared. Royal officials and Spanish Americans were split between those who supported the idea of maintaining the status quo—that is leaving all the government institutions and officers in place—regardless of the developments in Spain, and those who thought that the time had come to establish local rule, initially through the creation of juntas, in order to preserve the independence of Spanish America from the French or from a rump government in Spain that could no longer legitimately claim to rule a vast empire. It is important to note that, at first, the juntas claimed to carry out their actions in the name of the deposed king and did not formally declare independence. Juntas were successfully established in [[Captaincy General of Venezuela|Venezuela]], [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata|Río de la Plata]] and [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|New Granada]], and there were unsuccessful movements to do so in other regions. A few juntas initially chose to recognize the Regency, nevertheless the creation of juntas challenged the authority of all sitting royal officials and the right of the government in Spain to rule in the Americas.

In the months following the establishment of the Regency, it became clear that Spain was not lost, and furthermore the government was effectively reconstituting itself. The Regency successfully convened the [[Cortes Generales]], the traditional parliament of the Spanish Monarchy, which in this case included representatives from the Americas. The Regency and Cortes began issuing orders to, and appointing, royal officials throughout the empire. Those who supported the new government came to be called "royalists." Those that supported the idea of maintaining independent juntas called themselves "[[patriot (Spanish American Revolution)|patriot]]s," and a few among them were proponents of declaring full, formal independence from Spain. As the Cortes instituted liberal reforms and worked on drafting a constitution, a new division appeared among royalists. Conservatives (often called "[[Absolutism (European history)|absolutists]]" in the historiography) did not want to see any innovations in government, while liberals supported them. These differences would become more acute after the restoration of Ferdinand VII, because the king opted to support the conservative position.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 36–37, 134–135. Rodríguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 52–53. Kinsbruner, ''Independence in Spanish America'', 45–46, 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of regional rivalry===
Regional rivalry also played an important role in the internecine wars that broke out in Spanish America as a result of the juntas. The disappearance of a central, imperial authority—and in some cases of even a local, viceregal authority (as in the cases of New Granada and Río de la Plata)—initiated a prolonged period of [[balkanization]] in  many regions of Spanish America. It was not clear which political units which should replace the empire, and there were no new [[Nation|national identities]] to replace the traditional sense of being Spaniards. The original juntas of 1810 appealed first, to sense of being Spanish, which was juxtaposed against the French threat; second, to a general American identity, which was juxtaposed against the Peninsula which was lost to the French; and third, to a sense of belonging to the local province, the ''[[Fatherland|patria]]'' in Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 121, 131–132. Rodríguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 13–19, 22,&lt;/ref&gt; More often than not, juntas sought to maintain a province's independence from the capital of the former viceroyalty or captaincy general, as much as from the Peninsula itself. Armed conflicts broke out between the provinces over the question of whether some provinces were to be subordinate to others in the manner that they had been under the crown. This phenomenon was particularly evident in New Granada and Río de la Plata. This rivalry also lead some regions to adopt the opposing political cause from their rivals. Peru seems to have remained strongly royalist in large part because of its rivalry with Río de la Plata, to which it had lost control of Upper Peru when the latter was elevated to a viceroyalty in 1776. The creation of juntas in Río de la Plata allowed Peru to regain formal control of Upper Peru for the duration of the wars.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 57-71, 162–163, 240–242. Rodríguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 111–113, 126–136, 153–159, 176–179. Kinsbruner, ''Independence in Spanish America'', 53, 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restoration of Ferdinand VII===
The restoration of Ferdinand VII signified an important change, since most of the political and legal changes done on both sides of the Atlantic—the myriad of juntas, the Cortes in Spain and several of the congresses in the Americas that evolved out of the juntas, and the many constitutions and new legal codes—had been done in his name. Once in Spain Ferdinand VII realized that he had significant support from [[conservatism|conservatives]] in the general population and the hierarchy of the [[History of Roman Catholicism in Spain#19th century|Spanish Catholic Church]], and so on May 4, he repudiated the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812]] and ordered the arrest of liberal leaders who had created it on May 10. Ferdinand justified his actions by stating that the Constitution and other changes had been made by a Cortes assembled in his absence and without his consent. He also declared all of the juntas and constitutions written in Spanish America invalid and restored the former law codes and political institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 169–172. Kinsbruner, ''Independence in Spanish America'', 56–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

This, in effect, constituted a definitive break with two groups that could have been allies of Ferdinand VII: the autonomous governments, which had not yet declared formal independence, and Spanish liberals who had created a representative government that would fully include the overseas possessions and was seen as an alternative to independence by many in New Spain (today [[Mexico]]), [[Central America]], the [[Spanish West Indies|Caribbean]], Venezuela, Quito ([[Ecuador]]), [[Peru]], Upper Peru ([[Bolivia]]) and [[Chile]]. Most Spanish Americans were moderates who decided to wait and see what would come out of the restoration of normalcy. In fact in areas of New Spain, Central America and Quito, governors found it expedient to leave the elected constitutional ''[[Cabildo (council)|ayuntamientos]]'' in place for several years in order to prevent conflict with the local society.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 336. Rodríguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 106.&lt;/ref&gt; Liberals on both sides of the Atlantic, nevertheless, continued to conspire to bring back a constitutional monarchy, ultimately succeeding in 1820. The most dramatic example of transAtlantic collaboration is perhaps [[Francisco Javier Mina]]'s expedition to Texas and northern Mexico in 1816 and 1817.

Spanish Americans in royalist areas who were committed to independence had already joined guerrilla movements. Ferdinand's actions did set areas outside of the control of the royalist armies on the path to full independence. The governments of these regions, which had their origins in the juntas of 1810—and even moderates there who had entertained a reconciliation with the crown—now saw the need to separate from Spain, if they were to protect the reforms they had enacted.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 162. 171–172, 207. Rodríguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 173–175, 192–194&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restoration of the Spanish Constitution and independence===
{{further|Trienio Liberal}}

Spanish liberals finally had success in forcing Ferdinand VII to restore the Constitution on January 1, 1820, when [[Rafael del Riego|Rafael Riego]] headed a rebellion among troops which had been gathered for a large expeditionary force to be sent to the Americas. By March 7, the royal palace in Madrid was surrounded by soldiers under the command of General [[Francisco Ballesteros]], and three days later on March 10, the besieged Ferdinand VII, now a virtual prisoner, agreed to restore the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 194. Kinsbruner, ''Independence in Spanish America'', 88, 114, 120–121, 127–128.&lt;/ref&gt;

Riego's revolt had two significant effects on the war in the Americas. First in military matters, the large numbers of reinforcements, that were especially needed to retake New Granada and defend the Viceroyalty of Peru, would never arrive. Furthermore, as the royalist situation became more desperate in region after region, the army experienced wholesale defections of units to the patriot side. Second in political matters, the reinstitution of a liberal regime changed the terms under which the Spanish government sought to engage the insurgents. The new government naively assumed that the insurgents were fighting for Spanish liberalism and that the Spanish Constitution could still be the basis of reconciliation between the two sides. Government implemented the Constitution and held elections in the overseas provinces, just as in Spain. It also ordered military commanders to begin armistice negotiations with the insurgents with the promise that they could participate in the restored representative government.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 335–340. Rodríguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 194–195. Kinsbruner, ''Independence in Spanish America'', 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spanish Constitution, it turned out, served as the basis for independence in New Spain and Central America, since in the two regions it was a coalition of conservative and liberal royalist leaders who led the establishment of new states. The restoration of the Spanish Constitution and representative government was enthusiastically welcomed in New Spain and Central America. Elections were held, local governments formed and [[Deputy (legislator)|deputies]] sent to the Cortes. Among liberals, however, there was fear that the new regime would not last, and among conservatives and the Church, that the new liberal government would expand its reforms and anti-clerical legislation. This climate of instability created the conditions for the two sides to forge an alliance. This alliance coalesced towards the end of 1820 behind [[Agustín de Iturbide]], a colonel in the royal army, who at the time was assigned to destroy the guerrilla forces led by [[Vicente Guerrero]]. Instead Iturbide entered into negotiations, which resulted in the [[Plan of Iguala]], which would establish New Spain as an [[First Mexican Empire|independent kingdom]], with Ferdinand VII as its king. With the [[Treaty of Córdoba]], the highest Spanish official in Mexico approved the Plan of Iguala, and although the Spanish government never ratified this treaty, it did not have the resources to enforce its rejection. Ultimately, it was the royal army in Mexico that ultimately brought about that nation's independence.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch analyzes the events through the older theory of a "conservative revolution": ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 319–323. Compare to Rodríguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 196–197, 199–210, 241–242. Kinsbruner, ''Independence in Spanish America'', 97–99. Peter F. Guardino, "The War of Independence in Guerrero, New Spain, 1808-1821" in Archer,  ''The Wars of Independence in Spanish America'', 121–125.&lt;/ref&gt;

Central America gained its independence along with New Spain. The regional elites supported the terms of the Plan of Iguala and orchestrated the union of Central America with the Mexican Empire in 1821. Two years later following Iturbide's downfall, the region, with the exception of Chiapas, peacefully seceded from Mexico in July 1823, establishing the [[Federal Republic of Central America]]. The new state existed for seventeen years, centrifugal forces pulling the individual provinces apart by 1840.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 333–340. Rodríguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 210–213. Kinsbruner, ''Independence in Spanish America'', 100, 146–149.&lt;/ref&gt;

In South America independence was spurred by the pro-independence fighters that had held out for the past half decade. [[José de San Martín]] and [[Simón Bolívar]] inadvertently led a continental-wide [[pincer movement]] from southern and northern South America that liberated most of the Spanish American nations on that continent and secured the independence the [[Southern Cone]] had more or less experienced since 1810. In South America, royalist soldiers, officers (such as [[Andrés de Santa Cruz]]) and whole units also began to desert or defect to the patriots in large numbers as the royal army's situation became dire. During the end of 1820 in Venezuela, after Bolívar and [[Pablo Morillo]] concluded a cease fire, many units crossed lines knowing that Spanish control of the region would not last. The situation repeated itself in Peru from 1822 to 1825 as republican forces slowly advanced there. Unlike in Mexico, however, the top military and political leadership in these parts of South America came from patriot side and not the royalists.

The collapse of the constitutional regime in Spain in 1823 had other implications for the war in South America. Royalist officers, split between liberals and conservatives, fought an internecine war among themselves. General Pedro Antonio Olañeta, commander in Upper Peru, rebelled against the liberal viceroy of Peru, [[José de la Serna]], in 1823. This conflict provided an opportunity for the republican forces under the command of Bolívar and [[Antonio José de Sucre]] to advance, culminating in the [[Battle of Ayacucho]] on December 9, 1824. The royal army of Upper Peru surrendered after Olañeta was killed on  April 2, 1825. Former royalists, however, played an important part in the creation of Peru and Bolivia. In Bolivia, royalists, like Casimiro Olañeta, nephew of General Olañeta, gathered in a congress and declared the country's independence from Peru. And in Peru after Bolívar's forces left the country in 1827, Peruvian leaders undid many of his political reforms.

 [[File:Coronela.png|250px|thumb|right| [[Regimental colours|King's and Regimental Colors of the Foot Regiments of Royalist Army]] modeled on the [[Cross of Burgundy flag]] (the local [[coat of arms]] would replace the grey circles represented here).&lt;br&gt; Motto: '''''Por la Religión, la Patria y el Rey. Viva Fernando VII'''''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.napoleon-series.org/research/miscellaneous/c_spanishnationalism.html]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
There are two types of units: '''expeditionary units''' ( in Spanish: '''expedicionarios''') created in Spain and '''[[militia]]s''' (in Spanish: '''milicias'''), units which already existed or were created during the conflict in America.  The militias, which were composed wholly of militiamen who were residents or natives of Spanish America, were bolstered by the presence of "veteran units" (or "disciplined militia") composed of Peninsular and Spanish American veterans of Spain's wars in Europe and around the globe. The veteran units were expected to form a core of experienced soldiers in the local defenses, whose expertise would be invaluable to the regular militiamen who often lacked sustained military experience, if any. The veteran units were created in the past century as part of the [[Bourbon Reforms]] to reinforce Spanish America's defenses against the increasing encroachment of other European powers, such as during the [[Seven Years' War]].

Overall, Europeans formed only about a tenth of the royalist armies in Spanish America, and only about half of the expeditionary units. Since each European soldier [[casualty (person)|casualty]] was substituted by a Spanish American soldier, over time, there were more and more Spanish American soldiers in the expeditionary units. For example, [[Pablo Morillo]], commander in chief in Venezuela and New Granada, reported that he only had 2,000 European soldiers, in other words, only half of the soldiers of his expeditionary force were European. It is estimated that in the [[Battle of Maipú]] only a quarter of the royalist forces were European soldiers, in the [[Battle of Carabobo]] about a fifth, and in the [[Battle of Ayacucho]] less than 1% was European.

The American militias reflected the racial make-up of the local population. For example, in 1820 the royalist army in Venezuela had 843 white (''español''), 5,378 [[Casta]] and 980 [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native]] soldiers.

'''''Six Million Crucifixions: How Christian Teachings About Jews Paved the Road to the Holocaust''''' is a 2010 history book by author [[Gabriel Wilensky]]. The book examines the role [[Christianity and antisemitism|Christian teachings about Jews]] played in enabling the racial eliminationist antisemitism that gave rise to the [[Holocaust]]. In ''Six Million Crucifixions'' Wilensky argues that from the earliest days of the Christian movement an attitude of contempt toward Jews and [[Judaism]] emerged, which over time evolved into full-blown hatred. Wilensky argues that it was this foundation that made the various peoples of Europe ultimately receptive to the genocidal message of the [[Nazis]], and made large numbers of them willing collaborators in the extermination of two thirds of European Jewry in what is known as the ''Holocaust''.

The book concludes by arguing that following the Allied victory in the [[Second World War]], the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] should have tried any members of the [[Christian]] clergy who may have been complicit in the crimes of the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] and its allies before, during and after the war.

==Overview==
''Six Million Crucifixions'' has a foreword by [[Holocaust]] scholar [[John K. Roth]], who wrote "By now, numerous books by Christians, Jews, and others have taken Christianity to task for its many failures before, during, and after the Holocaust. But few, if any, hit harder than Wilensky's."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mJN8Bqvp30cC&amp;pg=PA16 |title=From the foreword to ''Six Million Crucifixions''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is divided into five parts. Part I provides a brief overview of some key events in the history of Christian-Jewish relations from the time of [[Jesus]] until the end of the [[Second World War]]. Part II specifically describes and discusses the phenomenon of [[Christianity and antisemitism|Christian antisemitism]]. Part III covers the role of the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] and [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] churches during the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] period and beyond. Part IV offers a short introduction to some legal concepts and provides an overview of criminal acts that Catholic and Protestant clergy, and the churches as institutions, may have been guilty of, and provides material that might have been used for an indictment had the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] pursued another set of international prosecutions at the end of the Second World War. Lastly, the Epilogue covers post-World War II events including positive steps taken by the Catholic and Protestant churches after the [[Second Vatican Council]].

Two appendices provide a list of anti-Jewish statements by many [[pope]]s throughout history, as well as a list of anti-Jewish [[papal bull]]s.

==Main Themes==

===The consequences of anti-Jewish teachings in Christianity===

Wilensky devotes a sizable part of ''Six Million Crucifixions'' to describe the genesis and evolution of anti-Jewish sentiment in Christianity. He describes in some detail how the feeling of animosity began since the early days of the Christian sect, and how it grew over time into open hatred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forewordreviews.com/reviews/six-million-crucifixions/|author=Breau, Elizabeth|date=2010-07-27|title=ForeWord Reviews|accessdate=2012-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book explains how this feeling became part of the foundational writings and teachings of the Catholic Church, and indeed an integral aspect of early Christianity. ''Six Million Crucifixions'' shows how anti-Jewish animosity emanating from all levels of the Church hierarchy molded the image the Christian faithful held about Jews, which in time became consistently negative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/main_Interfaith/nostra_aetate.htm?Multi_page_sections=sHeading_2|title=Nostra Aetate: Transforming the Catholic-Jewish Relationship|author=Eugene J. Fisher|date=2005-10-20|publisher=Anti-Defamation League|accessdate=2012-06-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911054654/http://www.adl.org/main_Interfaith/nostra_aetate.htm?Multi_page_sections=sHeading_2|archivedate=2012-09-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Six Million Crucifixions'' makes the point that even though not all Christians during the Nazi period were actively antisemitic, most were at a minimum passive bystanders during the persecution and extermination of Jews during the Holocaust. As Father [[John T. Pawlikowski]], Director of the Catholic-Jewish Studies Program at [[Catholic Theological Union]] in Chicago stated, "(Christianity) provided a seedbed—at least for acquiesence during the attacks on Jews."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.jewishreview.org/special/Catholic-Jewish-relations-intertwined-with-history|title= Catholic-Jewish relations intertwined with history|date=2010-05-03|publisher=Jewish Review|accessdate=2012-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilensky notes that even though many Christians may have disagreed with extermination as a means of solving the so-called "Jewish Question", they were passive bystanders precisely because as inheritors of centuries of anti-Jewish teachings they felt the Jews were guilty of a number of crimes and thus deserving of punishment, or that there was indeed a need to act that way in self-defense against what they perceived to be a Jewish threat. As the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]] explained, "Christian anti-Judaism did lay the groundwork for racial, genocidal anti-semitism by stigmatizing not only Judaism but Jews themselves for opprobrium and contempt."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.usccb.org/beliefs-and-teachings/ecumenical-and-interreligious/jewish/upload/Catholic-Teaching-on-the-Shoah-Implementing-the-Holy-See-s-We-Remember-2001.pdf|title= Catholic Teaching on the Shoah|publisher=National Conference of Catholic Bishops|accessdate=2012-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilensky also focuses on those people that confronted the persecution of Jews and helped to save them. In particular Wilensky acknowledges the actions of the Danish people whose help was instrumental in saving the vast majority of the country's Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://sdjewishjournal.com/site/980/2000-years-in-the-making/ |title=2,000 Years in the Making |author=Berman, Alanna |date=July 2010|publisher= San Diego Jewish Journal|accessdate=2012-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilensky also notes that after the Second Vatican Council in 1965 the Catholic and Protestant churches made great progress in redressing these problems and in fostering a better understanding and acceptance of Judaism within the Christian community.

===Indictment of the Church===

The other major theme in ''Six Million Crucifixions'' is prosecutorial. As [[Michael Berenbaum]], Director of the [[American Jewish University|Sigi Ziering Institute]] points out, ''Six Million Crucifixions'' is an indictment of the Catholic and Protestant churches, with an emphasis on the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/show/222799|author=Berenbaum, Michael|title=Goodreads|accessdate=2012-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilensky makes the suggestion that after the Second World War the Allies should have set up another international trial to prosecute any members of the clergy who may have been guilty of incitement or persecution of Jews before, during and after World War II. The book presents material that might have been used in a potential indictment had the Allies chosen to set up such a trial.

==Critical reception==

''Six Million Crucifixions'' has generally been well received by the critical media as well as scholars in the field of Holocaust studies and readers alike. Eugene J. Fisher, who is retired associate director of the Secretariat for Ecumenical and Interreligious Affairs at the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops|U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops]], in principle agrees with ''Six Million Crucifixions''' main thesis that Christians need to accept that the Christian teaching of contempt toward Jews and Judaism prepared the ground for the Nazi genocide. However, Fisher finds that despite the fact that the book is well-intentioned, it is ultimately flawed as "Wilensky presents what has been called by Jewish scholars a lachrymose view of Jewish-Christian history, emphasizing the negatives and ignoring or writing off the positive aspects of our two-millennium-long encounter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic-sf.org/news_select.php?newsid=10&amp;id=57773|title=One book on Nazism offers in-depth history, the other merely polemics|publisher=Catholic San Francisco|accessdate=2012-07-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120193936/http://catholic-sf.org/news_select.php?newsid=10&amp;id=57773|archivedate=2010-11-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elizabeth Breau writes in a [[ForeWord (magazine)|''ForeWord'' magazine]] review,  "Wilensky's writing is a lucid, concise reminder of why it is important to remember how deadly religious bigotry can be."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forewordreviews.com/reviews/six-million-crucifixions/|title=ForeWord Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Fred Reiss at San Diego Jewish World focuses on the book's main thesis, that is, that the frequently repeated anti-Jewish sermons and writings from Christian scholars, theologians and general clergy over a very long time had a profound negative influence on the Christian faithful. He writes, "Six Million Crucifixions brilliantly explains the anti-Semitic attitude of the Catholic Church and how, over the centuries, its repeated railings against the Jewish people created brutal waves of anger, which led to repeated mass murders of Jews in various local[e]s throughout Europe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sdjewishworld.wordpress.com/2010/08/28/was-the-holocaust-the-legacy-of-the-churchs-teachings/|title=San Diego Jewish World}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Gold Edition of the game containing both the core game and the expansion pack was released on September 18, 2009.

== Gameplay ==

The game allows players to choose either ''Scenarios'' with a defined scope and objective, or a ''Campaign'' "Sandbox" mode where there are no pre-determined victory conditions.  There are over 250 playable regions simulated in the game.  The player controls the economies, the militaries, research, government spending, spy operations (including the launching of satellites), and diplomacy. The player decides what military units to build, what facilities to build, how much or how little of a resource to produce, and also sets government policies in areas such as finance and social services.  Diplomatic options include alliances, treaties, and trades of resources and technologies. The player can lead his or her people in technological advances and social reforms including globalization, free trade, renewable resources, biotechnology, nanotechnology, robotics, cyborg engineering and neural interface.

''Supreme Ruler 2020'' generally operates as a [[real time strategy]] game, though players are able to pause the game or change the game speed.  The military element of the game is played through [[battalion]]-sized units represented on the game map, that can be controlled and given orders using the mouse individually or through groupings.  Optionally players may leave ''unit initiative'' turned on, which will allow the AI to control military units for the player.

The player may also use [[Cabinet Ministers]] to assist with the operation of their regions, through the use of a Minister-priorities system and an in-game [[email]] system.

Multiplayer is available in LAN or Internet play for up to 16 players.

'''Thomas Wapai N.S Wainggai''' (also known as '''Dr. Thom''') was a [[Western New Guinea|West Papuan]] scholar, political and cultural leader, philosopher, and nationalist; a true advocate of West Papuan self-determination and [[Melanesians|Melanesian]] identity. He was born and raised in [[Jayapura|Hollandia]], [[Netherlands New Guinea]], where he spent his young days. He became the first West Papuan to get an advanced education outside of West Papua. In 1988, he was arrested for his political beliefs and teachings and was sentenced to two decades behind bars. In 1996, he died as a political prisoner in an Indonesian prison.&lt;ref name=Herman /&gt;

==Education==
Dr. Thom grew up and went to school in his hometown of Jayapura, West Papua. After high school, he enrolled at the Cenderawasih university - one of the leading universities in West Papua.&lt;ref name=Herman /&gt; At Cenderawasih university, Dr. Thom excelled. He built up good grades and was selected for the exchange program in Japan. He graduated with a degree in Law at the [[Okayama University|Okayama]] University. He then traveled to the United States to study on a [[Fulbright Scholarship]]. He graduated with a master's degree (MA) in Public Administration at the [[State University of New York at Albany]], New York, and then earned a Doctorate of Philosophy from  Florida State University in 1987.&lt;ref name=thom&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sidney|first1=Jones|title=Injustice, Persecution, Eviction|date=January 1, 1990|publisher=Asia Watch|location=USA|pages=20–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had reached a level of education that many West Papuans of his time, even today, could not.

==Political views==
Dr. Thom was involved in politics as at an early age. As a young man, he watched West Papuans fight against the Indonesian occupation of their land since 1969. In 1988, as one of the West Papuan respected leaders, he began to teach a new kind of ideology: he taught that West Papuans are [[Melanesian]] people who are entitled to self-determination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Arena Magazine|title=Papua's Fallen Leaders|url=http://arena.org.au/papuas-fallen-leaders-2/|website=Arena Magazine|accessdate=28 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Thom channeled the frustration of the people of West Papua over the legality of Indonesian occupation of their lands. In his view, the manner in which West Papua was handed over to Indonesia was highly unfair, grossly unjust, and illegal based on International Human Rights laws and conventions. Dr. Thom, a trained lawyer did refuse to hide his disdain and dissatisfaction toward Indonesian occupation of West Papua and determined to fight against Indonesia through logical and legal arguments. He used his knowledge of international statues to challenge the legality of Indonesian occupation of West Papua, but during the Suharto regime, it was a war he couldn't win without losing his own life.

James Vorendberg of ''Asia Watch'' explained the kind of country Indonesia was &amp;ndash; and continues to this day &amp;ndash; during Dr. Thom's time: &lt;blockquote&gt;Indonesia, ostensibly a Democracy, is in fact an authoritarian state where real decision-making power rests with President Suharto and the Indonesian military. Presidential decrees and administrative regulations are the major source of law, and the Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat (DPR), the national parliament dominated - though appointment and electoral procedures - by the ruling party, GOLKAR (Golongan Karyan, literally "functional groups"), serves more as a forum for discussion of national issues than as a legislature.&lt;ref name="AW Committee" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The Indonesian government under President Suharto was essentially a "dictatorship" in which presidential directives were executed as laws making it extremely hard for critics to engage the state in public debate. The basic rights of speech and public discourses were effectively banned. Hundreds of Indonesians, including West Papuans, were arrested for speaking out against the state.&lt;ref name="Resistance" /&gt; Dr. Thom's dreams of an independent West Melanesia was seen as an extremely dangerous movement, and in 1988, the movement had its first test of the Suharto military justice.

==Historical background==
{{further|Western New Guinea}}

The people of West Papua occupied this land and remained virtually untouched for tens of thousands of years. They were a "gathering and hunting people" whose cultures were influenced by their thick natural rich dense forest and vast marine resources. However, the arrive of Europeans between 17th and 19th centuries changed all that.&lt;ref name =colonial&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.vanderheijden.org/ng/history.html|title = History of Netherlands New Guinea|date = 1 March 2005|accessdate = 2 January 2016|website = van der Heijden|last = Heijden|first = Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Netherlands (Dutch) claimed this territory by mere "proclamation" on August 24, 1828, and became a formal colony of the Netherlands in 1898.&lt;ref name=FWPC&gt;{{cite web|last1=FWPC|title=History of West Papua|url=http://freewestpapua.org/info/history-of-west-papua/|website=Free West Papua Campaign|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II, Indonesia declared independence and by 1949, the Dutch colonial administration recognized its independence but continued to prepare West Papuans for their own independence. It was a reasonable argument to make since West Papuans and Indonesians are two distinctive cultures and ethnically differently. In a surprising move, the Indonesian government declared Irian Jaya (former name of West Papua) and other Islands - such as East Timor - parts of Indonesia. This is the beginning of the tension between the Dutch government and the newly recreated state of Indonesia.&lt;ref name=colonial /&gt; On December 1, 1961, the West Papuan leaders - together with Dutch leaderships - raised the West Papuan flag for the first time; flying together as one. It was the beginning of the journey to self-determination. Indonesian president Sukarno had the backing of the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communist (CHICOM) launched a full-scale invasion of West Papua. The United States saw an opportunity to jeopardize Soviet efforts, offered Indonesian a deal - it was too good to pass up.

The negotiations between Indonesia, Britain and the UN culminated in the New York Agreement, proceeded by the [[Act of Free Choice]] in 1969. The ''Act of Free Choice'' laid the foundation to the ultimate annexation of West Papua by the Indonesian government. According to the [[New York Agreement]], it would be the responsibility of Indonesia and the UN to ensure that the people of West Papua voted to determine whether they would remain with Indonesia or to breakaway as an independent state. Unfortunately, voters were rounded up and coerced to vote in favor of Indonesia. In spite of the apparent flaws of that election, the UN observers quickly endorsed the election and leveled it "fair". West Papua was to be taken away from West Papuans based on an election whereby only a fraction of hand-picked voters determined that the rest of West Papuans - like the election or not - would be forever part of Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chomsky|first1=Noam|title=History of West Papua|url=http://freewestpapua.org/info/history-of-west-papua/|website=Free West Papua|publisher=FWP|accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Thom saw this as a day-light robbery of his people; culture, language, and rights to certain "inalienable" rights. His argument is that West Papuans are Melanesians who were wrongly taken from Melanesia under a sham election.

==Anti-Subversion Law==
In 1963, the government of Indonesia passed one if toughest laws - the "Anti-subversion" law. The law was passed to protect the state of Indonesia from conspiracy to overthrow or divide the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=ILO|title=Indonesian ( 611)|url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/natlex/natlex4.detail?p_lang=en&amp;p_isn=51160&amp;p_country=IDN&amp;p_count=611|website=International Labour Organisation (ILO)|accessdate=4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It explicitly defines the characteristics of individuals or movements liable to be tried under this statute:&lt;ref name=anti-subversion&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sebastian|first1=Leonard C|title=Realpolitik Ideology|date=2006|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asia Studies|location=Singapore|pages=433–436}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ANU&gt;{{cite web|last1=Susanti|first1=Bivitri|title=National Security, Terrorism, and Human Rights in Indonesia|url=https://digitalcollections.anu.edu.au/bitstream/1885/42063/1/Bivitri.pdf|website=Digitalcollection ANU|publisher=Australia National University|accessdate=4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*All actions Pancasila as the state ideology
*All actions that are considered to create insecurity of the state power, government of the state apparatuses 
*Spreading the feeling of enmity, disintegration, and instability amongst the security between Indonesia and other countries. 
*Disrupt and hamper industry, production, distribution, trade, cooperatives, or transportation conducted by the government. 
*State sympathy towards countries that are considered to be enemies for Indonesia.
*Mass destruction of the public buildings or personally owned buildings.
*The act of espionage
*The act of sabotage
This law was passed in 1963, two years after West Papua and Dutch authority hoisted the West Papuan flag - the [[Morning Star flag]] - on December 1, 1961,&lt;ref name="FWPC" /&gt; which West Papuans believed to be their self-determination day. By passing this law, the Indonesian government made it virtually impossible to criticize the state or do things that may appear to be threatening to the unity and safety of the state. Any movement that challenges the state authority can be prosecuted under this 'Anti-subversion' law.

== Arrest and incarceration ==
[[File:West Melanesia Flag.PNG|thumb|right|The flag of West Melanesia]]

Toward the end of 1988 - between November and December - Dr. Thom and his supporters met at his place where they mapped out a plan to declare the independence of West Melanesia - West Papua. On 14 December 1988, they marched to Manclula Sport Stadium in Jayapura. At the stadium, the [[Republic of West Papua|Republic of West Melanesia]] was proclaimed with Dr. Thom as president of the newly declared independent state.&lt;ref name="King2004"&gt;{{cite book|last1=King|first1=Peter|title=West Papua &amp; Indonesia since Suharto: independence, autonomy or chaos?|date=2004|publisher=University of New South Wales Press|location=Sydney|isbn=9780868406763}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new flag was raised featuring 14 stars with three coloured bars of black, red and white.&lt;ref name="King2004" /&gt; The flag had been sewn by his Japanese wife.&lt;ref name="King2004" /&gt; It would be the first time that West Papuan independence movement declared West Papua as a Melanesian territory.&lt;ref name="thom" /&gt;  Dr. Thom and his supporters apparently violated the 'Anti-subversion' law.

The Indonesian reaction was anticipated: Police officers arrived at the scene and apprehended Dr. Thom and other West Papuan political leaders; they were arrested and taken to military headquarters for interrogations. Taking these prisoners to military facilities made it extremely impossible for family members to visit them.&lt;ref name="AW Committee"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vorenberg|first1=James|title=Prison Conditions in Indonesia|date=1990|publisher=Asia Watch Committee (US)|location=USA|page=47|accessdate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trial ===
After World War II, the world, having seen the ugliness of war, came together to pass one of the most important documents of our time - [[Universal Declaration on Human Rights]]. This agreement, which was signed by the major powers of the world, called for the protection and safety of all human beings irrespective of their location and circumstances. It also calls for the protection of the rights of individuals to a "fair trial". &lt;blockquote&gt;'''Article 2:'''
Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinions, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. Furthermore, no distinction shall be made on the basis of the political, jurisdictional, or international status of the country or territory to which a person belongs, whether it be independent, trust, non-self-governing or under any other limitation of sovereignty.&lt;ref name="UN"&gt;{{cite web|last1=United Nations|title=THe Universal Declaration of Human Rights|url=https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/|website=United Nations|publisher=UN|accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The declaration Human Rights agreement was signed prior to the independence of Indonesia in 1949, however, as a member state of the United Nations, Indonesia is - by default and by virtue of that membership - bound by that agreement to respect and protect the rights of Indonesians. Since the Suharto regime rose to power in the 1967, rights of all citizens were never protected instead they were discarded whenever they run counter to the will of the regime. In 1989, Dr. Wainggai found himself in the same predicament.&lt;ref name="Resistance"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lawson|first1=Sylvia|title=Demanding the Impossible: About Resistance|date=February 1, 2012|publisher=Melbourne University Press|location=Australia|pages=133, 135|accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1989, West Papuans gathered to witness one of their heroes - Dr. Thom - taking on the full force of the Indonesian jurisprudence. According to Asia Watch, Dr. Thom was tried by the district court in Jayapura, in the months of April and June, in hearings that defied commonsense as it became transparent even to the unlearned that the Indonesian government (court) were pursuing long prison term against Dr. Thom even if it means violating common civil rights he was entitled to it. The court room was packed as indigenous people gathered to hear the proceedings. In June, however, the numbers of West Papuans who showed up fell dramatically because of political intimidation; police fired in the air and attendees were subjected to physical rough inspection.&lt;ref name=thom /&gt;

=== Dr. Thom vs. State ===
The [[Act of Free Choice]] held West Papua in 1969 was a highly controversial election. To West Papuan nationalists, the failure to consult them and the lack of equal representations at the polls was a slap in the face of Democracy. Lack of transparency on the part of the UN made that plebiscite a mere scam coated in the name of Democracy. The apparent disregard of the rights of West Papuans in the execution of this plebiscite led to the formation of the [[Free Papua Movement|Organisasi]] Papua Merdeka. Sympathizers and loosely associated groups often clashed with Indonesian police in violent struggles for control.

Intellectual leaders such as Dr. Thom, however, preferred to challenge the legality of the acquisition of West Papua by pointing out the inconsistencies and discrepancies within the government policies and national statues (constitution). They preferred intellectual rational debate based on the reading of the laws. Asian Watch cited an event that demonstrated this new approach. Prior to the public demonstration at the stadium, Dr. Thom dispatched supporters to notify the Indonesian authority of his planned public declaration of West Melanesian independence and the location of the event, which essentially eradicate state's claim of conspiracy to overthrow the government.&lt;ref name="thom" /&gt;  This new method of non-violent approach to Indonesian's claim over West Papua, made the state case against Dr. Thom extremely fluid and fundamentally weak. The state could not charge Dr. Thom with conspiracy to overthrow the government by force, nor did they have any evidence to just charge him for violence, public disturbance or obstruction of justice because his movement was completely devoid of violence and public disturbance.

Dr. Thom's movement was not only unique to the OPM's struggle, but one that renewed the call for dialogue and reasonable debate over facts and mere claims - a call to revisit the legality of the 1969 election. He apparently borrowed the Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King style approach to the struggles of West Papuans. Indonesia saw him as extremely dangerous. 
&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Mr. [[Herman Wainggai]], Dr. Thom's own nephew who followed his uncle's footsteps into the horror of Indonesian prison and served two years, referred to his uncle as the 'father of nonviolent struggle for the Liberation of West Papua.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Herman"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wainggai|first1=Herman|title=My Story|url=http://www.hermanwainggai.net/my-story-cont/|website=Herman Wainggai Network|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Dr. Thom's method caught the Indonesian government off guard, noted the Asia Watch.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thom" /&gt;

=== Judgement ===
On September 7, 1989, Dr. Wainggai was sentenced to 20 years in prison.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Dr. Thom would have been 71 if he served his full sentence.&lt;/ref&gt; It is obvious from this Asia Watch report that the Indonesian government wanted to convict Dr. Wainggai at all costs, even if means bending and ignoring his rights to a fair trial. The report summed up the trial this way: "The Trial was marked by the irregularity that characterized all Indonesian political trials, including restricted access by lawyers to their client, insufficient materials to prepare the defense, failure to call defense witnesses and limited time for cross examination."&lt;ref name="thom" /&gt;

Dr. Thom was held in a prison in West Papua for eight years, while his wife was kept in a separate prison designed for women. The couple were held in Jayapura prison from 1988 to 1990 before the Suharto regime relocated them to Jakarta amidst continual violent protests by West Papuan separatists. The conditions were absolutely harsh, but they had family and West Papua loyalists and die-hard nationalists visited him often.&lt;ref name="thom" /&gt;

Dr. Thom was sent to LP Cipinang prison, while his wife was transferred to Tangerang prison in Jakarta - the capital city of Indonesia.&lt;ref name=thom /&gt;&lt;ref name="AW Committee" /&gt;

== Suspicious death ==
While the conditions in the state penitentiary in Jakarta were comparatively better to that in Jayapura, West Papua, Dr. Thom's healthy gradually deteriorated. Keeping the Wainggai's in Jakarta made it extremely complicated for the Wainggai family to visit them on a regular basis. On March 12, 1996, six years after his transfer to Jakarta, Dr. Thom succumbed to the illness he suffered; he died in jail.&lt;ref name=Resistance /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chaos&gt;{{cite book|last1=King|first1=Peter|title=West Papua &amp; Indonesia Since Suharto - Independence, Autonomy, or Chaos|date=2004|publisher=UNSW Press|location=Australia|page=46|edition=First|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since the Indonesian government did not provide adequate explanation as to the true cause of his Dr. Thom's death, relatives in West Papua believed he died by poison. They believe that Dr. Thom was deliberately positioned - a position that the Council on Foreign Relations echoed in its finding while investigating the issues of West Papua.&lt;ref name=poison&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blair|first1=Dennis|last2=Philips|first2=David|title=Peace and Progress in Papua|date=2003|publisher=Council on Foreign Relation|location=US|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conspiracy theories==
According to reports, Dr. Thom returned from United States in late 1987 and worked as a lecturer at the [[Cenderawasih University]], West Papua. He was also elevated to a senior position in the "Provincial Planning" office in Jayapura. What triggered his radical move to declare West Papua an independent state remained a debatable issue. It is also debatable why he only planned with a few people prior to the demonstration at the Mandala National Stadium where he was arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rumble in the Jungle: Fighting for Freedom in West Papua|url=http://www.eco-action.org/dod/no8/rumble.html|website=DOD Magine|accessdate=3 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some suggested that Dr. Thom may have been unhappy and decided to take his personal anger to the national arena. Jones Sidney of Asia Watch provided a possible explanation for Dr. Thom's decision. According to Sidney, Dr. Thom had a personal goal that was to lead West Papua - formerly Irian Jaya - as governor. In 1987, he garnered enough support to run as a candidate in the 1987 governor's election. Unfortunately, he only received a few votes.&lt;ref name=thom /&gt; Sidney pointed to a popular view that he may have taken his personal dissatisfaction too far. This view suggested that Dr. Thom's decision to declare West Melanesia as an independent state came to being after the election, however, it didn't explain why Indonesian locked Dr. Thom up when he returned from Okayama University, Japan, for six months years back. It seems that Dr. Thom had held this position prior to 1987.&lt;ref name=Herman /&gt;

Another "theory" which emerged after Dr. Thom suddenly died in jail, after only serving only nine years of his 20 years prison term, is that the Indonesian authority poisoned Dr. Thom. This theory is also widely accepted by authors and foreign reporters as the cause of Dr. Thom's death. For instance, Denise C. Blair and David L. Philips wrote that Dr. Thom died in prison from "food poisoning" in 1996.&lt;ref name=poison /&gt; However, they failed to provide evidence to support that claim. Furthermore, the materials available contain little substantive evidence to support this claim. It may have emerged as West Papuans tried to make sense of what happened to their leader.&lt;ref name=poison /&gt; On the other hand, Indonesia's explanation also seemed sketchy. To this day, it remains somewhat vague to say with all certainty that Dr. Thom died of food poisoning; there must be hard-evidence to support this claim, so far, there's little.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8434">'''Transient-key cryptography''' is a form of [[public-key cryptography]] wherein [[keypair]]s are generated and assigned to brief [[Interval (time)|intervals]] of time instead of to individuals or organizations, and the blocks of cryptographic data are chained through time. In a transient-key system, [[private key]]s are used briefly and then destroyed, which is why it is sometimes nicknamed “disposable crypto.” Data encrypted with a private key associated with a specific time interval can be irrefutably linked to that interval, making transient-key [[cryptography]] particularly useful for [[Trusted timestamping|digital trusted timestamping]].

==Public-key vs. transient-key cryptography==
Both [[Public key|public-key]] and transient-key systems can be used to generate [[digital signature]]s that assert that a given piece of data has not changed since it was signed. But the similarities end there.
In a traditional public key system, the public/private keypair is typically assigned to an individual, server, or organization. Data signed by a private key asserts that the signature came from the indicated source. Keypairs persist for years at a time, so the private component must be carefully guarded against disclosure; in a public-key system, anyone with access to a private key can counterfeit that person's digital signature. 
In transient-key systems, however, the keypair is assigned to a brief interval of time, not to a particular person or entity. Data signed by a specific private key becomes associated with a specific time and date. A keypair is active only for a few minutes, after which the private key is permanently destroyed. Therefore, unlike public-key systems, transient-key systems do not depend upon the long-term security of the private keys.

==Establishing data integrity with transient-key timestamps==
In a transient-key system, the source of time must be a consistent standard understood by all senders and receivers. Since a local [[system clock]] may be changed by a user, it is never used as a source of time. 
Instead, data is digitally signed with a time value derived from [[Universal Coordinated Time|Universal Coordinated Time (UTC)]] accurate to within a millisecond, in accordance with the [[ANSI ASC X9.95 Standard|ANSI ASC X9.95 standard for Trusted Timestamping]]. 
Whenever a time interval in a transient-key system expires, a new public/private keypair is generated, and the private key from the previous interval is used to digitally certify the new public key. The old private key is then destroyed. This "key-chaining" system is the immediate ancestor of the [[Blockchain]] technology in vogue today.
For the new interval, time values are obtained from a trusted third-party source, and specific moments in time can be [[interpolated]] in between received times by using a time-biasing method based on the internal system timer. If a trusted time source cannot be obtained or is not running within specified [[Engineering tolerance|tolerances]], transient private keys are not issued. In that case, the time interval chain is terminated, and a fresh one is begun. The old and new chains are connected through network archives, which enable all servers to continue to verify the [[data integrity]] through time of protected data, regardless of how often the chain must be restarted.
The start times of the chain and of each interval can be coupled together to form an unbroken sequence of public keys, which can be used for the following:
* To irrefutably identify the time at which a set of data was signed.
* To identify the exact state of the data at the time it was signed.
As an extra security measure, all requests for signatures made during an interval are stored in a [[Data log|log]] that is [[concatenate]]d and is itself appended to the public key at the start of the next interval. This mechanism makes it impossible to insert new “signed events” into the interval chain after the fact.

==Cross-verification==
Through independently operating servers, '''cross-certification''' can provide third-party proof of the validity of a time interval chain and irrefutable evidence of consensus on the current time. Transient-key cryptographic systems display high [[Byzantine fault tolerance]]. A web of interconnected cross-certifying servers in a distributed environment creates a widely witnessed chain of trust that is as strong as its strongest link. By contrast, entire [[Hierarchy|hierarchies]] of traditional public key systems can be compromised if a single private key is exposed. 
An individual transient key interval chain can be cross-certified with other transient key chains and server instances. Through cross-certification, Server A signs Server B's interval chain, the signed data of which is the interval definition. In effect, the private keys from Server B are used to sign the public keys of Server A. In the diagram, a server instance is cross-certified with two other server instances (blue and orange).
[[Image:Cross-Certification.png|thumbnail|320px|A private key is cross-certified using two other transient-key servers.]]
Cross-certification requires that the timestamp for the interval agree with the timestamp of the cross-certifying server within acceptable tolerances, which are user-defined and typically a few hundred milliseconds in duration.

==Network archives==
Along with intervals, cross-certifications are stored in a network archive. Within a transient-key network, the [[archive]] is a logical [[database]] that can be stored and replicated on any system to enable verification of data that has been timestamped and signed by transient keys. A map of the set of accessible archives is stored within every digital signature created in the system. Whenever cross-certifications are completed at the beginning of an interval, the archive map is updated and published to all servers in the network.

==Verification==
During an interval, the transient private key is used to sign data concatenated with trusted timestamps and authenticity certificates. To [[File verification|verify]] the data at a later time, a receiver accesses the [[Persistence (computer science)|persistent]] public key for the appropriate time interval. The public key applied to the digital signature can be passed through published cryptographic routines to unpack the [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of the original data, which is then compared against a fresh hash of the stored data to verify data integrity. If the signature successfully decrypts using a particular interval's published public key, the receiver can be assured that the signature originated during that time period. If the decrypted and fresh hashes match, the receiver can be assured that the data has not been tampered with since the transient private key created the timestamp and signed the data. 
Transient-key cryptography was invented in 1997 by Dr. Michael D. Doyle of [http://www.eolas.com Eolas Technologies Inc.] and later acquired by and productized by [http://www.proofspace.com ProofSpace, Inc]. It is protected under [https://patents.google.com/patent/US6381696B1/en US Patents #6,381,696], [https://patents.google.com/patent/US7017046/en 7,017,046], [https://patents.google.com/patent/US7047415/en 7,047,415], &amp; [https://patents.google.com/patent/US7210035/en 7,210,035], and has been included in the [[ANSI ASC X9.95 Standard|ANSI ASC X9.95 standard for Trusted Timestamping]]. Transient-key cryptography is the predecessor to [[Forward secrecy]].  Despite the appearance that the [[Bitcoin]] [[blockchain (database)|blockchain]] technology was derived from Transient-key cryptography, Dr. Doyle has publicly denied he is [[Satoshi Nakamoto]].

The '''Universities and Colleges Admissions Service''' ('''UCAS''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|j|uː|k|ɑː|s}}) is a UK-based organisation whose main role is to operate the application process for British universities. It operates as an independent charity, funded by fees charged to applicants and to universities, plus advertising income, and was formed in 1992 through the merger of the former university admissions system [[Universities Central Council on Admissions|UCCA]] and the former polytechnics admissions system [[Polytechnics Central Admissions System|PCAS]].

Services provided by UCAS include several online application portals, a number of search tools and free information and advice directed at various audiences, including students considering higher education, students with pending applications to higher education institutes, parents and legal guardians of applicants, school and [[Further Education]] college staff involved in helping students apply and providers of higher education (universities and HE colleges).

While UCAS is best known for its undergraduate application service (the main UCAS scheme), it also operates a number of other admissions services:
* Conservatoires UK Admissions Service (CUKAS) – for performing arts at a UK conservatoire
* UCAS Teacher Training (UTT) – for postgraduate teacher training schemes
* UK Postgraduate Application and Statistical Service (UKPASS) – for some postgraduate courses
* UCAS Progress – for post-16 education and training

==Location==
UCAS is based&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/881170 |title=SO9524 : UCAS, New Barn Lane |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Geograph.org.uk |accessdate=16 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; near Marle Hill in [[Cheltenham]] at the junction of the B4075 (''New Barn Lane'') and the [[A435 road|A435]] (''Evesham Road''), near [[Cheltenham Racecourse]] and a [[park and ride]]. It is situated just inside the parish of [[Prestbury, Gloucestershire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/881386|title=Entrance to UCAS (C) Pauline E|website=www.geograph.org.uk|accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
UCAS was formed in 1992 by the merger of [[Universities Central Council on Admissions]] (UCCA) and [[Polytechnics Central Admissions System]] (PCAS) and the name UCAS is a contraction of the former acronyms UCCA and PCAS. An early proposal was made for the new merged body to be called PUCCA, but this was never adopted.&lt;ref name="John Fairhall 1984, p.2"&gt;John Fairhall, 'Admissions streamlining plan for polytechnics' in ''The Guardian'' (UK Newspaper) 12 January 1984, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

UCCA was the older of the two bodies, having been formed in 1961 to provide a clearing house for university applications in the United Kingdom. It was created in response to concerns during the 1950s that the increase in University applications was unmanageable using the systems then in place, where each student applied individually to as many institutions as they chose. This concern led to the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals ([[CVCP]]) setting up an ad hoc committee in 1957 to review the matter; this committee in its Third Report of January 1961 recommended the setting up of a central agency, which subsequently became known as UCCA. Its First and Second Reports had already made a number of recommendations aimed at harmonising admissions procedures across different universities.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gordon and Denis Lawton, ''Dictionary of British Education'' (London: Routledge, 2003) p.254&lt;/ref&gt;

The name UCCA referred originally to the management board (the Central Council) overseeing the new process, but soon came to refer to the organisation responsible for its day-to-day operation. This was based initially in London, and moved to [[Cheltenham]], Gloucestershire in 1968. The new scheme had a pilot year handling a subset of applications for entry in 1963, and its first full year of operation handled admissions for 1964.&lt;ref&gt;W. Stewart, ''Higher Education in Post-war Great Britain'' (London: Macmillan, 1989) p.88&lt;/ref&gt;

The scheme was essentially a collaborative venture between independent universities, and membership was voluntary. Most English universities joined from the start. Oxford and Cambridge joined (with slightly modified procedures) for the 1966 entry; the London medical and dental schools, as well as Belfast and Stirling for 1967. In 1965 UCCA handled 80,033 applicants, rising to 114,289 1969. The acceptance rate of UCCA applicants by universities in 1969 stood at just over 50%.&lt;ref&gt;R.C. Slater, 'University Admissions' in ''The Proceedings of IERE,'' vol. 8 no. 3, 1970, p.33&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, processing of applications was carried out using [[punched card]] technology. In 1964, UCCA started using the services of a [[computer bureau]] with a [[Univac]] machine; in 1967 it installed its own [[Univac]] computer.

Although the polytechnics were degree-teaching institutions, through the [[CNAA]] awards system, they were not eligible for admission to UCCA as it was reserved only for universities with degree awarding powers. Despite this the [[Polytechnic (United Kingdom)|Polytechnics]] were involved as early as 1972 in discussions with [[Universities Central Council on Admissions|UCCA]] and the [[Central Register and Clearing House]] about the possible future shape of one or more admissions systems.&lt;ref name=RKU&gt;Kay, Ronald "UCCA: Its Origins and Development 1950=85", UCCA, 1985, pp.83–89&lt;/ref&gt; At this stage applicants dealt directly with each individual polytechnic and the polytechnics themselves were strongly regional or local in their appeal. A study in 1977 found that between sixty and seventy per cent of those admitted to a polytechnic had applied to that institution only, and that forty per cent of admissions to polytechnics resulted from applications made in August or September of the year of entry.&lt;ref name=RKU/&gt;

In 1983 the Committee of Directors of Polytechnics began negotiations with UCCA to share its computing, technical and office facilities in [[Cheltenham]] to establish a course entrance system, based on the existing model used by UCCA.&lt;ref&gt;Audrey Segal, 'A rationalised confusion' in ''The Guardian'' (UK Newspaper) 31 January 1984, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; A grant of £210,000, from the British [[Department for Education and Science]], was awarded to set up a new unified admissions system, provisionally called PUCCA.&lt;ref name="John Fairhall 1984, p.2"/&gt; However, instead of a unified system for both the universities and polytechnics a separate system for polytechnics emerged from the negotiations, modelled on UCCA, but known as PCAS. Applicants to courses were given the option to apply separately for universities or polytechnics, or for both.

The PCAS system came into effect in 1985.&lt;ref name="Polytechnic Central Admissions System 1985, p.11"&gt;'Introducing the new Polytechnic Central Admissions System' in ''The Guardian'' (UK Newspaper) 11 June 1985, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; It was led by its first Chief Executive, Tony Higgins,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;'Sector pays tribute to Higgins, champion of access' in The Times Higher Education Supplement (UK newspaper) 23 April 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and in the first year it handled around 140,000 applications to polytechnic courses, of whom 40,000 a year went on to study at polytechnics.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Fennell, 'Horizons: Don't blot your copy book – The odds are moving back in favour of the applicant for higher education' in ''The Times'' (UK Newspaper) 21 September 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

Although many polytechnics offered art and design programmes, and some also offered teacher training courses, these admissions systems remained outside PCAS.&lt;ref name="Polytechnic Central Admissions System 1985, p.11"/&gt; Art and Design admissions worked to a later timetable as a result of the role Art Foundation courses had in developing a student's proposed specialism (painting, sculpture, graphic design and so on).  Work was furthermore generally submitted before a decision was made on whether to interview. However means of absorbing the [[Art and Design Admissions Registry]] into UCAS were found by 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Editorial, Times Higher Education Supplement, 9 August 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the aim to create a unified application system for universities and polytechnics was not achieved in 1985, the Chief Executive of PCAS, Tony Higgins, continued to push for the merger of PCAS with UCCA.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In 1992, following the change of status and name of most polytechnics to universities,&lt;ref&gt;Donald MacLeod, 'Poly genesis: Have the new universities lost their ray since they emerged from the old olytechnics ?', in ''The Guardian'' (UK Newspaper) 3 September 2002, Section B, p.12&lt;/ref&gt; the two bodies combined under Higgins's leadership.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Initially the application form was branded jointly UCCA/PCAS,&lt;ref&gt;'The new joint UCCA/PCAS application form' in ''The Guardian'' (UK Newspaper) 10 September 1991, Section B, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; but in 1994 the new merged body was officially renamed UCAS.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Croall, 'Nightmare Scenario' in ''The Guardian'' (UK Newspaper) 19 August 1993, Section B, p.9&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the Amsterdam Fashion Academy became the first non-UK educational establishment admitted to UCAS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/student-life/11524932/Choosing-a-university-abroad.html|title=Choosing a university abroad|first=Jessica|last=Moore|date=10 April 2015|publisher=|accessdate=22 September 2018|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/oct/03/british-university-students-who-study-abroad-europe|title=Who needs Oxbridge?

==Undergraduate admissions schemes==

{{Refimprove section|date=April 2017}}

=== Main undergraduate scheme ===
Since the vast majority of UK universities and higher education colleges use the UCAS service, all students planning to study for an undergraduate degree in the UK must apply through UCAS – including home students (generally British and EU students) and international students (non-EU).

==== Application ====

To apply to university, students must submit a single application via UCAS' online Apply service. The application itself requires the student to register to the service, giving a buzzword if applying through a centre, fill in personal details, write a personal statement and choose up to five courses to apply to, in no order of preference. They must then pay an application fee and obtain a reference before submitting their application online by the appropriate deadline. The application is then forwarded by UCAS to the universities and colleges that the students have applied to, who then decide whether to make students an offer of a place. Universities give students either an unconditional offer, where the student will receive a place regardless, or a conditional offer, where the student will receive a place subject to their grades being met.

For applications to universities in the UK, entry requirements for individual courses can either be based on grades of qualifications (e.g. AAA at GCE A-Level, a score of 43/45 in the IB International Baccalaureate Diploma, or a music diploma) or in UCAS points (e.g. 300 UCAS points from 3 A-Levels or an IB score equal to 676 UCAS points). To convert individual scores or grades of specific qualifications into UCAS points, UCAS has created tariff tables indicating indexes and ratios of UCAS points and results of qualifications.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ucas.com/providers/services/qualifications/ucas-tariff&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an A* at A-level is worth 56 UCAS points, an A 48, a B 40 and so on. For the IB, a score of 45 equals 720 UCAS points, a score of 40 is 611 points, a score of 35 is 501 etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://university.which.co.uk/advice/how-do-i-calculate-ucas-points-based-on-your-predicted-grades|title=Calculating Ucas points based on predicted grades - Which?|website=university.which.co.uk|accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Personal details ====
Once logged into "Apply", applicants complete a number of personal details – including their current qualifications, employment and criminal history, national identity, ethnic origin and student finance arrangements. Applicants also have the option to declare if they have any individual needs – such as any disabilities; or if they’re a care leaver.

==== Personal statements ====
The personal statement is an integral part of the application. It gives candidates a chance to write about their achievements, their interest in the subject they are applying for, as well as their suitability, interest, and commitment to higher education. Personal statements can contain a maximum of 4,000 characters (including spaces) or 47 lines – whichever comes first, with a maximum of 94 characters per line. A research study conducted by UCAS with over 300,000 personal statements of students revealed that the personal statement (among the student's grades) is the most important part within the application process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/technology-science/science/ucas-reveals-language-tricks-help-5929898|title=UCAS reveals the secret to writing uni applications: passion AND purpose|first=Jasper|last=Hamill|date=22 June 2015|publisher=|accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Application fees and references ====

The final part of the process involves paying an application fee and obtaining a written reference. The process varies depending on whether a student is applying through a school, college or UCAS centre or as an individual.

For the former, applications are sent to the school, college or centre, who may ask applicants to pay their fee to them (which they then pass to UCAS) or pay UCAS directly, before they provide a reference and submit the form on the student’s behalf. If applications are sent to the school, college or centre, then they will attach a reference to send to UCAS. Applicants are responsible for ensuring that their school, college or centre submits the application before the appropriate deadline for their courses.

Individual applicants should request their reference – from a teacher, adviser or professional who knows them – before paying the fee and submitting the form themselves.

For most current applications, the cost per student is £13 to apply for a single course, or £24 for two or more courses.

==== Application deadlines ====

Depending on the subject and on the university that they are applying for, candidates must submit their application by the relevant submission deadline to ensure their application is given equal consideration by the higher education providers they are applying to.

* 15 October deadline: Those applying for medicine, dentistry and veterinary science courses and anyone applying to the universities of Oxford and Cambridge must submit their UCAS applications by 15 October – in the year before the student wishes to start their studies. 
* 15 January deadline: The majority of applications must be submitted by 15 January (in the calendar year that the student wishes to begin their studies).
* 24 March deadline: Some art and design courses have a later application deadline – 24 March – to give them time to complete their portfolios.

It is possible for students to submit applications up until 30 June each year; but a late submission may not be given the same consideration as those submitted before the deadline. Applications received after 30 June are placed directly into Clearing.

==== Offers ====

Students must adhere to their appropriate deadline for their course. Whilst UCAS advises universities and colleges to send their decisions by the end of March, the universities have the responsibility of responding to applicants and may operate in their own timescale. Many universities (like the [[University of Oxford]] and the [[University of Cambridge]]) require that applicants come to an interview before offers are received; or they may be asked to submit an additional piece of work before receiving an offer.

Offers are made through UCAS' Track service by universities and are either unconditional or conditional, where the latter means that the student will receive a place dependent on exam performance. Applicants also find out if they have been rejected through UCAS Track.

Once an applicant has received a reply from their choices, they must reply to their university before the deadline in May. Applicants normally choose two offers through UCAS, one as their firm choice and one as their insurance choice. A firm choice means that, if the student receives their grades required, then the student will receive an unconditional offer. An insurance choice means that, if the firm choice university rejected them due to their grades, then the student will get into that university, if they have met the terms and conditions of the insurance choice's conditions.

==== Extra ====

If an applicant uses all of their five choices, and does not receive any offers, or they decide to decline the offers they receive, they can apply for additional courses using UCAS' Extra service. This allows them to keep applying, one course at a time, until they receive an offer they're happy with. Extra runs between mid-February and the end of June. If they don't get an offer during this time, they have the option to enter into Clearing when it opens in July. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ucas.com/ucas/undergraduate/apply-and-track/track-your-application/extra-choices|title=Not holding any offers? You might be able to apply for more with Extra!|date=2014-10-17|work=UCAS|access-date=2017-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===={{anchor|Confirmation and clearing}} Confirmation and clearing ====

When applicants receive their examination results, they will know if they have met the conditions of their firm and insurance choices. Universities give out unconditional offers and rejections when applicants receive their examination results.

Those that do have their offers confirmed are invited to accept a place on the course they applied to, which is called "confirmation". Many universities and colleges still accept students that narrowly miss their offer conditions.

Those that do not meet their "firm" and "insurance" offer conditions are eligible to use UCAS' Clearing service – which enables unplaced students to apply for courses with vacancies directly to the university. They do so by searching for an available course, using the UCAS search tool, and contacting each university or college concerned for a place.

Although clearing is most commonly used following results days in August, it opens at the start of July each year and closes in late September.

==== Adjustment ====

If applicants exceed the conditions of their firm offer, they have the option to search for a place at another university or college while retaining their original offer. This is known as "adjustment", a service which is available between 14 and 31 August.

=== UCAS Conservatoires – performing arts scheme ===

{{Unsourced section|date=April 2017}}

* Royal Academy of Music, London
* Royal Birmingham Conservatoire (part of Birmingham City University)
* Royal College of Music, London

* 15 January – for most undergraduate dance, drama and screen production courses

== UCAS postgraduate admissions schemes ==

{{Unsourced section|date=April 2017}}

=== UTT – postgraduate teacher training ===
UCAS Teacher Training (UTT) is an application service for postgraduates that want to become teachers. UTT replaced UCAS' previous GTTR teacher training application service and expanded its remit to provide centralised admissions for School Direct and school-centred initial teacher training (SCITT) programmes.

UTT programmes are either university/college-taught or school-based, and typically last for one academic year; usually leading to a PGCE qualification.

Students begin their application in the autumn for programmes starting in the following academic year. They start by using Apply 1 – which allows them to choose up to three programmes. Training providers then have 40 working days to make an offer. During this time they will invite candidates they're considering offering a place to for an interview. At the end of the 40-day period, students will have responses from their three choices and will have 10 working days to reply to any offers.

However, if students don't get offered a place using Apply 1, or they choose to decline all of the offers they receive, they can use Apply 2 to apply for new places,adding one choice at a time, until they receive an offer. 
* Apply 1 opens on 21 November each year
* Apply 2 opens on 2 January each year

=== UCAS Postgraduate – postgraduate admissions scheme ===

UCAS Postgraduate (also known as UKPASS) is UCAS' postgraduate admissions service. It was introduced with the objective to offer students access to over 20,000 courses at 18 participating universities and colleges in England, Scotland and Wales – both taught and research courses leading to a variety of qualifications – including MA, MSc, MBA and LLM.

==Other schemes==

=== UCAS Progress – post-16 education and training admissions scheme ===
UCAS has launched UCAS Progress, a service enabling GCSE students to search and apply for post-16 work and education-based training courses – including academic and vocational courses (such as A levels and BTECs), as well as Apprenticeship and Traineeship programmes. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ucas.com/ucas/16-18-choices/about-us|title=About us|date=2014-10-22|work=UCAS|access-date=2017-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scheme is free for students to use and is implemented as a national service – listing post-16 opportunities from all across the UK.

UCAS Progress also helps schools, colleges and local authorities address recruitment issues and statutory obligations resulting from raising the age of participation in secondary education; an initiative which legally obliges students to remain in full-time education or work-based training until the end of the academic year that they turn 17. However this is about to change after government reforms; when students will be required to remain in education or training until their 18th birthday.

== UCAS Media ==

{{One source section|date=May 2018}}

UCAS Media is a commercial enterprise that raises money by offering commercial organisations and education providers a channel to communicate with prospective students: in effect, it sells targeted advertising space.

UCAS Media does not disclose information about applicants to its advertising clients.  However, it does send advertisements to applicants on behalf of its clients, and is able to target specific groups such as 'early adopters' or those located in a specific location.

All UCAS Media profits are fed back into the UCAS charity, much of which is [[Gift Aid|gift aided]]. This reduces the fees paid by universities and by applicants for access to the UCAS service.

UCAS Media has proven controversial among data privacy campaigners.  In 2014 deputy director of [[Big Brother Watch]], Emma Carr, was quoted as saying: {{Quote
|text="UCAS is perfectly within the law to sell on this information, but the way they are doing so, as is the situation with most data gathering organisations, is underhand. It goes far beyond what students would expect them to do with their data.  Students should be explicitly asked for their permission before UCAS can sell their information on and UCAS should be open and transparent about who it is selling the data on to."}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/mar/12/ucas-sells-marketing-access-student-data-advertisers|title=Ucas sells access to student data for phone and drinks firms' marketing|first=Lucy|last=Ward|date=12 March 2014|website=the Guardian|accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Xu Xing''' ({{zh|w=Hsü Hsing|t=許行}};about 372 - 289 century BC) was a [[Chinese philosophy|Chinese philosopher]] and one of the most notable advocates of [[Agriculturalism]], a political philosophy that advocated peasant [[utopian]] [[communalism]] and [[egalitarianism]].&lt;ref name="wp"&gt;{{cite book|last= Deutsch |first=Eliot |author2=Ronald Bontekoei |year=1999 | page= 183|title=A companion to world philosophies|publisher=Wiley Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a group of followers he settled in the state of [[Teng (state)|Teng]] in about 315 BC. A disciple of his visited the Confucian philosopher [[Mencius]], and a short report of their conversation discussing Xu Xing's philosophy survives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The "Nung-chia" 農 家 'School of the Tillers' and the Origins of Peasant Utopianism in China|author=A.

On May 16, 1961, [[Park Chung-hee]], [[Kim Jong-pil]], and Lee Nak-sun successfully staged a military coup d'etat.

Lee was forced to leave politics and went to the United States where he was vocally opposed to the military coup in Korea and studied Political Science at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].
