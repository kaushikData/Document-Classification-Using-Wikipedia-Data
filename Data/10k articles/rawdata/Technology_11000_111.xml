'''Astronics Max-Viz''' is an American company founded in [[Portland, Oregon]] on May 31, 2001 as Max-Viz, Inc.&lt;ref name="Oregon Business License"&gt;{{cite web|title=Oregon Business Entity Data|url=http://egov.sos.state.or.us/br/pkg_web_name_srch_inq.show_detl?p_be_rsn=841913&amp;p_srce=BR_INQ&amp;p_print=FALSE|publisher=State of Oregon|accessdate=8 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to design, manufacture and certify Enhanced Vision Systems ("EVS") primarily for use in the aerospace industry.  Max-Viz EVS devices present real-time images of the external environment on aircraft cockpit monitors to improve pilot situational awareness under circumstances where visibility is impaired by weather or darkness.  The company objective is to help the pilot see clearly and fly safely by providing visual information about where they are, where they are going and what is in their way.    The Max-Viz EVS captures and enhances thermal [[infrared]] signals and can be combined with visible light as well as other electromagnetic energy sources.  The company's systems are designed to be integrated with a variety of displays already in the aircraft cockpit.&lt;ref name="Company Overview"&gt;{{cite web|title=KippsDeSanto &amp; Co.

==History==
The company came into being as a result of two inventions that allowed for possibility of a small lightweight design for EVS that could be deployed onto small private and commercial aircraft and helicopters.

The first invention was an uncooled focal plane array licensed from [[Honeywell]] (called a [[microbolometer]]) that could detect thermal infrared radiation, did not require a cryogenic cooling system (as conventional systems required in the 1990s) and could convert the electromagnetic thermal impulses into signals that could be displayed on a monitor.  The second invention was a patented system to fuse video images from multiple sources developed by Dr. J. Richard Kerr (one of the original founders of Max-Viz).&lt;ref name="Richard Kerr Founder"&gt;{{cite web|title=Executive Profile J. Richard Kerr Ph.D.|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=3688969&amp;privcapId=3643754&amp;previousCapId=3643754&amp;previousTitle=Max-Viz,%20Inc.|publisher=Business Week}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This invention &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Patent 6,232,602|url=http://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=6232602&amp;idkey=NONE&amp;homeurl=http%3A%252F%252Fpatft.uspto.gov%252Fnetahtml%252FPTO%252Fpatimg.htm|publisher=US Patent and Trademark Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; enabled signals from a visible light source to be combined with the signals from an infrared source (like the Honeywell focal plane array mentioned above) and present a picture which Astronics describe as "turning night into day".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New infrared system turns night into day|url=http://www.aopa.org/News-and-Video/All-News/2013/January/10/New-infrared-system-turns-night-into-day.aspx|publisher=AOPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Max-Viz start-up was financed with initial investments from a number of Portland area angel investors, strategic investments from [[FLIR Systems]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FLIR Systems|url=http://investors.flir.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=297684|publisher=FLIR Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and, later, with venture capital funding from OVP Venture Partners,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of OVP Investments|url=http://www.ovp.com/complete-list/|publisher=OVP Venture Partners}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander Hutton Venture Partners,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AHVP Portfolio Investments |url=http://www.ahvp.com/portfolio.html |publisher=AHVP |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130822104820/http://ahvp.com/portfolio.html |archivedate=2013-08-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Montlake Capital,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Portfolio Company News|url=http://archive.constantcontact.com/fs018/1102192932259/archive/1103516052688.html|publisher=Montlake Capital}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Highway 12 Ventures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Highway 12 Portfolio Companies|url=http://www.highway12ventures.com/portfolio/our-companies/|publisher=Highway 12 Ventures}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Max-Viz licensed the [[microbolometer]] design from [[Honeywell]] for use in aviation and initially licensed the fusion patent (developed by Dr. Kerr) from ''[[FLIR Systems]]''.  In 2012, the company was acquired by [[Astronics Corporation]] &lt;ref name="Astronics Acquisition of Max-Viz"&gt;{{cite web|title=Astronics Corporation Acquires Enhanced Vision Systems Provider Max-Viz, Inc.|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20120731005386/en/Astronics-Corporation-Acquires-Enhanced-Vision-Systems-Provider#.UxDaCfldV8E|publisher=Business Wire}}&lt;/ref&gt; (NASDAQ: ATRO) as a wholly owned subsidiary.&lt;ref name="Max-Viz continues as wholly owned subsidiary"&gt;{{cite web|title=Portland's Max-Viz acquired in deal that could reach $18M|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/portland/news/2012/07/31/portlands-max-viz-acquired-in-deal.html|publisher=Portland Business Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By May 2011, the company had sold more than 1,000 EVS systems using 50+ aviation certifications on more than 200 different aircraft models including business jets, helicopters and various piston driven aircraft.&lt;ref name="Shipments and Certifications"&gt;{{cite web|title=Max-Viz ships 1,000th system|url=http://generalaviationnews.com/2011/05/11/max-viz-ships-1000th-system/|publisher=General Aviation News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among those companies that offer the Max-Viz EVS at the factory on selected aircraft models are [[AgustaWestland]],&lt;ref name="Agusta EVS Installations"&gt;{{cite web|title=A109 Power Deliveries Commence To Saudi Aramco |url=http://www.agustawestland.com/node/3295 |publisher=Agusta Westland |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327221253/http://www.agustawestland.com/node/3295 |archivedate=2014-03-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Beechcraft]],&lt;ref name="Beechcraft EVS Installations"&gt;{{cite web|title=Enhanced Vision Now Available for King Air 90, 200, 300; Hawker 700, 800 and 900 Available Soon |url=http://www.beechcraft.com/customer_support/hawker_beechcraft_services/Special_Promotions/MaxViz.aspx |publisher=Beechcraft |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327234905/http://www.beechcraft.com/customer_support/hawker_beechcraft_services/Special_Promotions/MaxViz.aspx |archivedate=2014-03-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bell Helicopter]],&lt;ref name="Bell EVS Installations"&gt;{{cite web|title=Astronics Max-Viz EVS approved for Bell 429|url=http://www.helicoptersmagazine.com/content/view/4077/38/|publisher=Helicopters Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Cessna]]'',&lt;ref name=Cessna&gt;{{cite web|title=Cessna Max-Viz Enhanced Vision System|url=http://www.flyingmag.com/photo-gallery/photos/cessna-max-viz-enhanced-vision-system|publisher=Flying}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cirrus Aircraft]]&lt;ref name="Max-Viz EVS on Cirrus"&gt;{{cite web|title=Astronics Delivers 600th Max-Viz Enhanced Vision System to Cirrus|url=http://www.dailyfinance.com/2012/10/08/astronics-delivers-600th-max-viz-enhanced-vision-s/|publisher=Daily Finance}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Eurocopter]].&lt;ref name="Eurocopter EASA STC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Max-Viz Enhanced Vision Systems Approved by EASA for Eurocopters|url=http://www.aviationpros.com/press_release/10714442/max-viz-enhanced-vision-systems-approved-by-easa-for-eurocopters|publisher=Aviation Pros}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Max-Viz continues as a standalone business unit of Astronics Corporation and focuses its resources on core competencies involving packaging &amp; design, image fusion and certification/installation of EVS systems.

== Products ==

The company's first product was the Max-Viz 1000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Max-Viz EVS-1000 for Pilatus PC-12 |url=http://www.westair.com/images/pdfs/MAX-VIZ-EVS.pdf |publisher=Western Aviation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110109233616/http://westair.com/images/pdfs/MAX-VIZ-EVS.pdf |archivedate=2011-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and was certified in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jet Aviation Equips first Falcon 50EX with Max-Viz 1000|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/jet-aviation-equips-first-falcon-50ex-with-max-viz-evs-1000-174271/|publisher=Flight Global}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It contained a single [[microbolometer]] to detect thermal radiation and was made of an exotic compound called [[Vanadium(V) oxide|Vanadium Oxide]] tuned to detect infrared waves in the 8 to 12 micron bandwidth.  The sensor had a 53-degree field of view (slightly wider than normal 30 degree human vision) and produced a video signal that could be fed to a monitor using a standard RS-170, the standard [[NTSC]] signal used in analog displays.  The Max-Viz 1000 system weighed about 5 pounds and required 10 watts during normal usage at 28 VDC.  This product was produced from 2003 to 2008.  The company's second product was the Max-Viz 2500 and was certified in 2005.&lt;ref name="EVS-2500 Introduction"&gt;{{cite web|title=Max-Viz Demonstrates New Level of Capabilities With Synthetic-Enhanced Vision System; U.S. Air Force Research Laboratories Supported Test Program of SE-Vision Systems Underway|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20050405005409/en/Max-Viz-Demonstrates-Level-Capabilities-Synthetic-Enhanced-Vision-System#.UxDhaPldV8E|publisher=Business wire}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This product contained two sensors; a long wave microbolometer like the one used in the Max-Viz 1000 and a short wave sensor that could pick up the incandescent lights from the airport environment.  This system had a 30-degree field of view (equal to the field of view of human vision) and weighed 10 pounds.  This product was produced from 2005 to 2010.

The Max-Viz 1500 was introduced in 2008 was an enhancement of the Max-Viz 1000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pilots Embracing Low Cost EVS|url=http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/nbaa-convention-news/2008-09-30/pilots-embracing-low-cost-evs|publisher=AIN Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It offers an optical dual field of view (30° and 53°) and advanced image processing to avoid blooming and washout.&lt;ref name="Max-Viz 1500 product specifications"&gt;{{cite web|title=Max-Viz 1500|url=http://max-viz.com/products/evs-1500/|publisher=Max-Viz}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both the Max-Viz 1000 and Max-Viz 1500 use the same housing making it easier for existing Max-Viz 1000 customers to upgrade and preserving the investment in FAA certifications.&lt;ref name="16500 uses same housing as 1000"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sikorsky S-76 Gets Max-Viz EVS STC|url=http://www.helicoptersmagazine.com/content/view/1240/60/|publisher=Helicopters Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Max-Viz 600 was also introduced in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EVS-600 available on Cirrus aircraft|url=http://www.avweb.com/news/aopa/AOPAExpo2008_CirrusAddsEnhancedVision_199136-1.html|publisher=Aviation news}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This product was specifically designed for the General Aviation community and is housed in ultra-lightweight high impact plastic weighing less than 1.2 pounds.  The system is dual wavelength (infrared and visible light sensors) and uses a patented process to fuse the images.&lt;ref name="Max-Viz 600 product specifications"&gt;{{cite web|title=Max-Viz 600|url=http://max-viz.com/products/evs-600/|publisher=Max-Viz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11654">In an '''asymmetric multiprocessing system''' ('''AMP'''), not all CPUs are treated equally; for example, a system might allow (either at the hardware or [[operating system]] level) only one CPU to execute operating system code or might allow only one CPU to perform I/O operations.  Other AMP systems would allow any CPU to execute operating system code and perform I/O operations, so that they were symmetric with regard to processor roles, but attached some or all peripherals to particular CPUs, so that they were asymmetric with respect to the peripheral attachment. Asymmetric multiprocessing  was the only method for handling multiple CPUs before [[symmetric multiprocessing]] (SMP) was available. It has also been used to provide less expensive options&lt;ref&gt;{{cite manual

Additionally, AMP is used in applications that are dedicated, such as embedded systems, when individual processors can be dedicated to specific tasks at design time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283733254_A_Survey_Of_Techniques_for_Architecting_and_Managing_Asymmetric_Multicore_Processors A Survey Of Techniques for Architecting and Managing Asymmetric Multicore Processors], ACM Computing Surveys, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[Image:Asmp 2.gif|250px|thumb|right|Asymmetric multiprocessing]][[Multiprocessing]] is the use of more than one CPU in a computer system.  The CPU is the arithmetic and logic engine that executes user applications.  With multiple CPUs, more than one set of program instructions can be executed at the same time.  All of the CPUs have the same user-mode instruction set, so a running job can be rescheduled from one CPU to another.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/dec/pdp11/1174/Introduction_To_Multiprocessing_Jun79.pdf Introduction to Multiprocessing]: distinguishes “symmetric” from “master/slave”&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and history==
For the room-size computers of the 1960s and 1970s, a cost-effective way to increase compute power was to add a second CPU.  Since these computers were already close to the fastest available (near the peak of the price:performance ratio), two standard-speed CPUs were much less expensive than a CPU that ran twice as fast.  Also, adding a second CPU was less expensive than a second complete computer, which would need its own peripherals, thus requiring much more floor space and an increased operations staff.

Notable early AMP offerings by computer manufacturers were the [[Burroughs B5000]], the [[DECsystem-10|DECsystem-1055]], and the [[IBM System/360]] model 65MP.  There were also dual-CPU machines built at universities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/Early_Computers_at_Stanford#DEC_PDP-10_2 Early Computers at Stanford: the dual processor computer at the AI lab]&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem with adding a second CPU to a computer system was that the operating system had been developed for single-CPU systems, and extending it to handle multiple CPUs efficiently and reliably took a long time.  To fill this gap, operating systems intended for single CPUs were initially extended to provide minimal support for a second CPU.  In this minimal support, the operating system ran on the “boot” processor, with the other only allowed to run user programs.  In the case of the Burroughs B5000, the second processor's hardware was not capable of running "control state" code.&lt;ref name="b5000opchar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/burroughs/B5000_5500_5700/5000-21005_B5000_operChar.pdf|title=Operational Characteristics of the Processors for the Burroughs B5000|publisher=Burroughs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other systems allowed the operating system to run on all processors, but either attached all the peripherals to one processor or attached particular peripherals to particular processors.

==Burroughs B5000 and B5500==
An option on the Burroughs B5000 was “Processor B”. This second processor, unlike “Processor A” had no connection to the peripherals, though the two processors shared main memory, and Processor B could not run in Control State.&lt;ref name="b5000opchar"/&gt; The operating system ran only on Processor A. When there was a user job to be executed, it might be run on Processor B, but when that job tried to access the operating system the processor halted and signaled Processor A. The requested operating system service was then run on Processor A.

On the B5500, either Processor A or Processor B could be designated as Processor 1 by a switch on the engineer's panel, with the other processor being Processor 2; both processors shared main memory and had hardware access to the I/O processors hence the peripherals, but only Processor 1 could respond to peripheral interrupts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/burroughs/B5000_5500_5700/1023579_Narrative_Description_Of_B5500_MCP_Oct66.pdf|title=A Narrative Description of the B5500 MCP|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a job on Processor 2 required an operating system service it would be rescheduled on Processor 1, which was responsible for both initiating I/O processor activity and responding to interrupts indicating completion. In practice, this meant that while user jobs could run on either Processor 1 or Processor 2 and could access intrinsic library routines that didn't require kernel support, the operating system would schedule them on the latter whenever possible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/burroughs/B5000_5500_5700/1023579_Narrative_Description_Of_B5500_MCP_Oct66.pdf A Narrative Description of the B5500 MCP, pages 29 (initiate routine) and 40 (a note on parallel processing)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==CDC 6500 and 6700==
Control Data Corporation offered two configurations of its [[CDC 6000 series]] that featured two [[CDC 6000 series#Central processor|central processors]].  The CDC 6500&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ed-thelen.org/comp-hist/CDC-6600RefMan.pdf|title=CONTROL DATA 6400/6500/6600 COMPUTER SYSTEMS Reference Manual}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a CDC 6400 with two central processors.  The CDC 6700 was a CDC 6600 with the CDC 6400 central processor added to it.

These systems were organized quite differently from the other multiprocessors in this article.  The operating system ran on the [[CDC 6000 series#Peripheral processors|peripheral processors]], while the user's application ran on the CPUs.  Thus, the terms ASMP and SMP do not properly apply to these multiprocessors.

==DECsystem-1055==
[[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) offered a dual-processor version of its [[DECsystem-10|DECsystem-1050]] which used two KA10 processors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.textfiles.com/bitsavers/pdf/dec/pdp10/TOPS10_softwareNotebooks/vol01/DEC-10-MZDC-D.pdf Introduction to DECsystem-10 Software, section 1.4 (DECsystem-10 Multiprocessing)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/dec/pdp10/TOPS10_softwareNotebooks/vol01/DECsystem-10_Technical_Summary_1981.pdf DECsystem-10 Technical Summary page 2-1]&lt;/ref&gt;  This offering was extended to later processors in the PDP-10 line.

==PDP-11/74==
[[Digital Equipment Corporation]] developed, but never released, a multiprocessor [[PDP-11]], the PDP-11/74,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miim.com/faq/hardware/multipro.html|title=(PDP-11) Multiprocessor FAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; running a multiprocessor version of [[RSX-11M]].&lt;ref name="rsx11mp-spec"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/dec/pdp11/1174/RSX11-mP_FuncSpec_Apr77.pdf|title=RSX-11M multiprocessing|publisher=Digital Equipment Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In that system, either processor could run operating system code, and could perform I/O, but not all peripherals were accessible to all processors; most peripherals were attached to one or the other of the CPUs, so that a processor to which a peripheral wasn't attached would, when it needed to perform an I/O operation on that peripheral, request the processor to which the peripheral was attached to perform the operation.&lt;ref name="rsx11mp-spec"/&gt;

==VAX-11/782==
DEC's first multi-processor [[VAX]] system, the VAX-11/782, was an asymmetric dual-processor system; only the first processor had access to the I/O devices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/dec/vax/EG-21731-18_VAX_Product_Sales_Guide_Apr82.pdf VAX Product Sales Guide, pages 1-23 and 1-24]: the VAX-11/782 is described as an asymmetric multiprocessing system in 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

==Univac 1108-II==
The [[UNIVAC 1108|Univac 1108-II]] and its successors had up to three CPUs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/Remington_Rand/SperryRand.UNIVAC1108II.1965.102646105.pdf|title=Univac 1108-II announcement|publisher=Sperry Rand}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rmarsh.cs.und.edu/CLASS/CS451/HANDOUTS/os-unisys.pdf|title=A history of Univac computers and Operating Systems|access-date=2013-04-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140802000016/http://rmarsh.cs.und.edu/CLASS/CS451/HANDOUTS/os-unisys.pdf|archive-date=2014-08-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These computers ran the [[UNIVAC EXEC 8]] operating system, but it is not clear from the surviving documentation where that operating system was on the path from asymmetric to symmetric multiprocessing.

==IBM System/370 model 168==
Two options were available for the [[IBM System/370 Model 168]] for attaching a second processor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite manual
 |     author = IBM
 |       title = IBM System/370 Model 168 Functional Characteristics
 |         id = GA22·7010-4

 |       date = January 1976
 |        url = http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/370/funcChar/GA22-7010-4_370-168_funcChar_Jul76.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One was the IBM 3062 Attached Processing Unit, in which the second processor had no access to the channels, and was therefore similar to the B5000's Processor B or the second processor on a VAX-11/782.  The other option offered a complete second CPU, and was thus more like the System/360 model 65MP.

The '''bauma''' (International Trade Fair for Construction Machinery, Building Material Machines, Mining Machines, Construction Vehicles and Construction Equipment) is the world's largest trade fair in the construction industry. The trade fair, which can be visited by anyone, is held every three years on the grounds of the [[Neue Messe München]] and lasts for seven days. The next fair will be held from 8 to 14 April 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bauma.de/trade-fair/exhibitors/bauma/index.html | title=bauma 2019 | author= | date= | website= | publisher=bauma | language= | accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trade fairs==
The Bauma 2013 was held from 15 to 21 April 2013, with approximately 3,420 exhibitors from 57 countries (2010: 3,150 exhibitors from 53 countries, 2007: 3,002 exhibitors from 48 countries)and attended by over 530,000 visitors (2010: approximately 415,000,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bauma.de/link/en/23318858#23318858 - official summary for the 2010 fair] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706114057/http://www.bauma.de/link/en/23318858#23318858 |date=July 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 2007: 500,000). The 200,000 foreign visitors came from 200 different countries. The exhibition area was 570,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (2010: 555,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 2007: 540,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), of which 180,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; was within the hall areas. Partner region was the land of Indonesia. The last fair was held from 11 to 17 April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.bauma.de/en/fuer_die_presse/schlussbericht/schlussbericht.php | title= bauma 2013: gigantic, amazing, supreme | author= | date= | website= | publisher=bauma | language= | accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bauma is the world’s largest trade fair based on the measured surface space. The exhibition area is spread throughout all the halls of Neue Messe München and the enlarged outdoor area for this exhibition.

In addition to the manufacturers of classical construction equipment ([[excavator]]s, [[Crane (machine)|crane]]s, [[road roller]]s, etc.), the fair provides a large selection of manufacturers of tools (such as [[saw]]s, [[drill]]s, cutters), site equipment, [[formwork]], [[scaffolding]], formwork accessories, [[Heavy equipment|construction vehicles and machinery]], such as equipment for the [[building material]] industry and [[mining]].

==Branches==
An important branch of the fair is the ''bauma China'', which takes place every two years each November in [[Shanghai]], [[China]], serving the Southeast Asian market. Another international trade fair modeled after the Bauma is also the ''bC India - A Bauma Conexpo show'' - which was held from the 8 to 11th February, 2011 in [[Mumbai]], [[India]], for the first time. [http://eqpt.in/news/bauma-conexpo-india-2016.html Bauma Conexpo India 2016] is being held for the fourth time in India from December 12 to 15, 2016 at the HUDA Ground in [[Gurgaon]]/Delhi.  The last event was held in [[Greater Noida]] in December 2014, was attended by 635 companies from 25 countries and 26,018 specialist visitors.

==History==
The first exhibition took place in 1954, and every year after that until 1967, on a portion of the former airport Oberwiesenfeld, now the location of [[Olympiapark, Munich]]. The Bauma is organized by [[Messe München]] since 1966 and since 1998, Bauma is located at the Neue Messe München exhibition center in [[Trudering-Riem|Riem]], where the fair was the first major exhibition on the site.

[[File:First Tractor Company - old working model - 01.jpg|thumb|right|A working bulldozer from the [[First Tractor Company]], on [[Xinbu Island]], Hainan, China.]]
A  '''bulldozer''' is a [[Tractor crawler|crawler]] ([[continuous track]]ed [[tractor]]) equipped with a substantial metal plate (known as a [[Bulldozer#Blade|blade]]) used to push large quantities of [[soil]], sand, rubble, or other such material during [[construction]] or conversion work and typically equipped at the rear with a claw-like device (known as a [[Bulldozer#Ripper|ripper]]) to loosen densely compacted materials.

Bulldozers can be found on a wide range of sites, [[mining|mine]]s and [[Quarry|quarries]], military bases, [[heavy industry]] factories, engineering projects and [[farm]]s.

The term "bulldozer" correctly refers only to a tractor (usually tracked) fitted with a dozer blade.

== Description ==
[[File:CAT-D10N-pic001.jpg|thumb|A [[Caterpillar D10]]N bulldozer equipped with a single shank ripper.]]
Typically, bulldozers are large and powerful tracked heavy equipment. The tracks give them excellent ground holding capability and mobility through very rough terrain. Wide tracks help distribute the bulldozer's weight over a large area (decreasing [[ground pressure]]), thus preventing it from sinking in [[sand]]y or [[mud]]dy ground. Extra wide tracks are known as ''swamp tracks'' or ''LGP'' (low ground pressure) tracks. Bulldozers have transmission systems designed to take advantage of the track system and provide excellent [[tractive force]].

Because of these attributes, bulldozers are often used in [[road building]], [[construction]], [[mining]], [[forestry]], [[land clearing]], infrastructure development, and any other projects requiring highly mobile, powerful, and stable earth-moving equipment.

Another type of bulldozer is the wheeled bulldozer, which generally has four wheels driven by a 4-wheel-drive system and has a hydraulic, [[Articulated steering#Articulated steering|articulated steering]] system. The blade is mounted forward of the articulation joint, and is hydraulically actuated.

The bulldozer's primary tools are the '''blade''' and the '''ripper'''.

The word "bulldozer" is sometimes used inaccurately for other similar construction vehicles such as a large [[loader (equipment)|front loader]].

=== Blade ===
[[File:Wintershall Monte Kali 01.jpg|thumb|Bulldozer blade]]
[[File:Komatsu bulldozer pushing coal in Power plant Ljubljana (winter 2017).jpg|thumb|Komatsu bulldozer pushing up to 7m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; with semi-U tilt dozer]]
The bulldozer [[blade]] is a heavy metal plate on the front of the tractor, used to push objects, and shove [[sand]], soil, [[debris]], and sometimes [[snow]]. Dozer blades usually come in three varieties:
# A straight blade ("S blade") which is short and has no lateral curve and no side wings and can be used for fine grading.
# A universal blade ("U blade") which is tall and very curved, and has large side wings to carry more material.
# An "S-U" (semi-U) combination blade which is shorter, has less curvature, and smaller side wings. This blade is typically used for pushing piles of large rocks, such as at a quarry.

Blades can be fitted straight across the frame, or at an angle, sometimes using additional 'tilt cylinders' to vary the angle while moving. The bottom edge of the blade can be sharpened, e.g. to cut tree stumps.

Sometimes a bulldozer is used to push another piece of earth moving equipment known as a "[[Wheel tractor-scraper|scraper]]". The towed [[Fresno Scraper]], invented in 1883 by [[James Porteous]], was the first design to enable this to be done economically, removing the soil from the ''[[Cut and fill|cut]]'' and depositing it elsewhere on shallow ground (''fill''). Many dozer blades have a reinforced center section with this purpose in mind, and are called "bull blades".

In military use, dozer blades are fixed on [[combat engineering vehicle]]s and can optionally be fitted on other vehicles, such as [[artillery tractor]]s such as the [[Hitachi Type 73|Type 73]] or [[M8 Tractor]]. Dozer blades can also be mounted on [[main battle tank]]s, where it can be used to clear antitank obstacles, mines, and dig improvised shelters. Combat applications for dozer blades include clearing battlefield obstacles and preparing fire positions.&lt;ref name="trewhitt"&gt;{{cite book |last=Trewhitt |first=Philip |title=Armoured Fighting Vehicles |year=1999 |publisher=Dempsey-Parr |isbn=1-84084-328-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ripper ===
[[File:Liebherr 724 Planierraupe 4.jpg|thumb|Multi-shank ripper]]
The '''ripper''' is the long claw-like device on the back of the bulldozer. Rippers can come as a single (single shank/giant ripper) or in groups of two or more (multi shank rippers). Usually, a single shank is preferred for heavy ripping. The ripper shank is fitted with a replaceable [[tungsten]] [[steel]] [[alloy]] tip, referred to as a 'boot'.
Ripping rock breaks the ground surface rock or pavement into small rubble easy to handle and transport, which can then be removed so grading can take place. With agricultural ripping, a farmer breaks up rocky or very hard earth (such as [[podzol]] hardpan), which is otherwise unploughable, in order to farm it. For example, much of the best land in the [[California]] wine country consists of old [[lava]] flows. The grower shatters the lava with heavy bulldozers so surface crops or trees can be planted.
Some bulldozers are equipped with a less common rear attachment referred to as a stumpbuster, which is a single spike that protrudes horizontally and can be raised to get it (mostly) out of the way. A stumpbuster is used to split a tree stump. A bulldozer with a stumpbuster is used for landclearing operations, and is often equipped with a brush-rake blade.

== Modifications ==
[[File:Liebherr 631 Kettenlader 1.JPG|thumb|right|A tracked [[Loader (equipment)|loader]]]]
Bulldozers have been further modified over time to evolve into new machines which can work in ways that the original bulldozer cannot.

One example is that [[Loader (equipment)|loader]] tractors were created by removing the blade and substituting a large volume bucket and hydraulic arms which can raise and lower the bucket, thus making it useful for scooping up earth and loading it into [[truck]]s, these are often known as a Drott, trackscavator or track loader.

Other modifications to the original bulldozer include making it smaller to let it operate in small work areas where movement is limited, such as in [[mining]].

Some lightweight form of bulldozer are commonly used in snow removal and as a tool for preparing winter sports areas for ski and snowboard sports.

A very small light bulldozer is sometimes called a "calfdozer".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=calfdozer&amp;client=firefox-b&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiImpDElOXVAhXCUlAKHcv4B3QQ_AUICigB&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=1010 Google search for images]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an '''angledozer''' ([http://www.travellerdave.co.uk/?p=7194 image here]) the blade can be pushed forward at one end to make it easier to push material away to the side.

Nevertheless, the original earthmoving bulldozers are still irreplaceable as their tasks are concentrated in [[deforestation]], earthmoving, ground levelling, and road carving. Heavy bulldozers are mainly employed to level the terrain to prepare it for construction. The construction, however, is mainly done by small bulldozers and [[Loader (equipment)|loader]] tractors.

=== Armored bulldozers ===
{{main|Armored bulldozer}}
[[File:Idf CAT D9R.jpg|thumb|An armored [[IDF Caterpillar D9|Caterpillar D9R]] Bulldozer used by [[Israel Defense Forces]]]]
Bulldozers employed for [[Combat engineer|combat engineering roles]] are often fitted with [[armor]] to protect the driver from firearms and debris, enabling bulldozers to operate in combat zones. The most widely documented use is the [[Israeli Defence Forces|Israeli Defence Forces' (IDF)]] militarized [[IDF Caterpillar D9|Caterpillar D9]], for earth moving, clearing terrain obstacles, opening routes, detonating explosive charges. The extensive use of armored bulldozers during the [[Second Intifada]] drew controversy and criticism from human rights organizations while military experts saw it as a key factor in reducing IDF casualties.

Some forces' engineer doctrines differentiate between a Low-Mobility Armoured Dozer (LMAD) and a High-Mobility Armoured Dozer (HMAD). The former is dependent on a flatbed to move it to its employment site, whereas the latter has a more robust engine and drive system designed to give it road mobility with a moderate range and speed. HMADs however normally lack the full cross-country mobility characteristics of a dozer-blade equipped tank or armoured personnel carrier.

Some bulldozers have been fitted with armor by non-government civilian operators to prevent bystanders or police from interfering with the work performed by the bulldozer, as in the case of [[Strike action|strikes]] or demolition of [[Eminent domain|condemned]] buildings. This has also been done by civilians with a dispute with the authorities, such as [[Marvin Heemeyer]], who outfitted his Komatsu D355A bulldozer with homemade composite armor to then demolish government buildings.

== History ==
[[File:Liebherr 722 Planierraupe 1.JPG|thumb|A [[Liebherr]] bulldozer with a multi-shank ripper.]]
[[File:Poti Seaport, Georgia — Receiving of New Bulldozers for Solid Waste Management (03).jpg|thumb|Bulldozer for solid waste management.]]
The first bulldozers were adapted from [[Holt Manufacturing Company|Holt]] farm tractors that were used to [[plow]] fields. The versatility of tractors in soft ground for logging and road building contributed to the development of the armoured [[tank]] in [[World War I]].
[[File:3-IDF-D9-bulldozers-Zachi-Evenor.jpg|thumb|Three [[IDF Caterpillar D9]] [[armored bulldozer]]s. The IDF uses the D9 for [[combat engineering]] and [[counter-terrorism]] operations.]]

In 1923, a young farmer named James Cummings and a draftsman named J. Earl McLeod made the first designs for the bulldozer. A replica is on display at the city park in [[Morrowville, Kansas]] where the two built the first bulldozer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OZVrxulVBtoC&amp;pg=PA189&amp;dq=James+Cummings+J.+Earl+McLeod+bulldozer&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Gtt4T_S_L_Cu2AXLoYW2Bg&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=James%20Cummings%20J.%20Earl%20McLeod%20bulldozer&amp;f=false |title=Kansas Curiosities: Quirky Characters, Roadside Oddities &amp; Other Offbeat Stuff|accessdate=2012-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 18, 1923, Cummings and McLeod filed U.S. patent #1,522,378 that was later issued on January 6, 1925 for an "Attachment for Tractors."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/US1522378?printsec=abstract&amp;dq=1522378&amp;ei=iagXT7qWCYqbtwe76JHpAg#v=onepage&amp;q=1522378&amp;f=false Patent 1522378, Attachment For Tractors, John E McLeod and James D Cummings, Filed December 18, 1923.]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1920s, tracked vehicles became common, particularly the [[Caterpillar 60]]. Rubber-tired vehicles came into use in the 1940s. To dig [[canal]]s, raise earth [[dam]]s, and do other earth-moving jobs, these tractors were equipped with a large thick metal plate in front. (The blade got its curved shape later). In some early models the driver sat on top in the open without a cabin. There are three main types of bulldozer blades: a U-blade for pushing and carrying dirt relatively long distances, a straight blade for "knocking down" and spreading piles of dirt, and a brush [[Rake (tool)|rake]] for removing brush and roots. These attachments (home-built or built by small equipment manufacturers of attachments for wheeled and crawler tractors and trucks) appeared by 1929.

Widespread acceptance of the bull-grader does not seem to appear before the mid-1930s. The addition of power down-force provided by hydraulic cylinders instead of just the weight of the blade made them the preferred excavation machine for large and small contractors alike by the 1940s, by which time the term "bulldozer" referred to the entire machine and not just the attachment.

Over the years, bulldozers got bigger and more powerful in response to the demand for equipment suited for ever larger [[earthworks (engineering)|earthworks]]. Firms like [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]], [[Komatsu Limited|Komatsu]], [[Case CE|Case]], [[Euclid Trucks|Euclid]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Haddock|first=Keith|title=Euclid-General Motors' Crawler Tractor|url=http://pendergast.ca/antiqueengine/euclid.htm|publisher=PEI Tractor Club|accessdate=11 September 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319094927/http://pendergast.ca/antiqueengine/euclid.htm|archivedate=19 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Allis Chalmers]], [[Liebherr]], [[LiuGong Construction Machinery, LLC.|LiuGong]], [[Terex]], [[Fiat-Allis]], [[Deere &amp; Company|John Deere]], [[BEML]], XGMA and [[International Harvester]] manufactured large tracked-type [[earthmoving]] machines. [[R.G. LeTourneau]] and [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]] manufactured large rubber tired bulldozers.

Bulldozers grew more sophisticated as time passed. Improvements include drivetrains analogous to (in automobiles) an [[automatic transmission]] instead of a manual transmission such as the early Euclid C-6 and TC-12 or Model C Tournadozer, blade movement controlled by [[Hydraulics|hydraulic]] cylinders or electric motors instead of early models' cable  winch/brake, and automatic grade control. Hydraulic cylinders enabled the application of down force, more precise manipulation of the blade and automated controls.

In the very snowy [[winter of 1946–47 in the United Kingdom]], in at least one case a remote cut-off village running out of food was supplied by a bulldozer towing a big sledge carrying necessary supplies.

A more recent innovation is the outfitting of bulldozers with [[GPS]] technology, such as manufactured by [[Topcon]] Positioning Systems, Inc., [[Trimble Inc]], or [[Leica Geosystems]] for precise grade control and (potentially) "stakeless" construction. As a response to the many, -and often varying claims about these systems, The Kellogg Report&lt;ref&gt;The Kellogg Report LLC (2010). Article: The Kellogg Report. Retrieved December 15, 2010 from [http://www.kelloggreport.com/index.html kelloggreport.com]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; published in 2010 a detailed comparison of all the manufacturers' systems, evaluating more than 200 features for dozers alone.

The best known maker of bulldozers is Caterpillar. [[Komatsu Limited|Komatsu]], [[Liebherr Group|Liebherr]], [[Case CE|Case]] and [[John Deere]] are present-day competitors. Although these machines began as modified farm tractors, they became the mainstay for big civil construction projects, and found their way into use by [[military]] construction units worldwide. The best-known model, the [[Caterpillar D9]], was also used to clear [[Landmines|mine]]s and [[demolition|demolish]] enemy structures.

==Manufacturers==
Industry statistics based on 2010 production published by Off-Highway Research showed [[Shantui]] was the largest producer of bulldozers, making over 10,000 units that year or 2 in 5 crawler-type dozers made in the world.&lt;ref name=production&gt;{{cite news|title=Shantui officially largest dozer producer in the world |url=http://www.earthmover.com.au/new-equipment/2011/may/shantui-officially-largest-dozer-producer-in-the-world |newspaper=The Earthmover &amp; Civil Contractor |date=May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521222430/http://www.earthmover.com.au/new-equipment/2011/may/shantui-officially-largest-dozer-producer-in-the-world |archivedate=2013-05-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The next largest producer by number of units is [[Caterpillar Inc.]], which produced 6,400 units.&lt;ref name=production /&gt;

[[Komatsu Limited|Komatsu]] introduced the D575A in 1981, the D757A-2 in 1991, and the D575A-3 in 2002 that the company touts as the biggest bulldozer in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.komatsu.com.au/AboutKomatsu/NewsAndPublications/News/Pages/THE-WORLDS-BIGGEST-DOZER-ROLLS-OFF-THE-LINE.aspx "The Worlds biggest Dozer Rolls Off The Line"]- Retrieved 2016-02-26&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the word ==
* 19th century: term used in engineering for a horizontal [[forging press]].
* Around 1880: In the USA, a "bull-dose" was a large dose (namely, one large enough to be literally or figuratively effective against a bull) of any sort of medicine or punishment. 'Bull-dosing' meant a severe [[whip]]ping or coercion, or other [[intimidation]] such as at gunpoint.&lt;ref name="History of the Bulldozer" /&gt; It had a particular meaning in the [[Southern United States]] as a whipping or other punishment for [[African Americans]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1876|1876 Presidential Election]].  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kelly |first1=John |title=What in the Word?! The racist roots of ‘bulldozer’ |url=https://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2018/02/14/word-racist-roots-bulldozer/ |website=[[Oxford English Dictionary|Oxford Dictionaries]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |accessdate=21 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1886: "bulldozer" meant a large-caliber [[pistol]] and the person who wielded it.&lt;ref name="History of the Bulldozer"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://inventors.about.com/od/bstartinventions/a/bulldozer.htm |title=History of the Bulldozer |accessdate=2008-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Late 19th century: "bulldozing" meant using brute force to push over or through any obstacle, with reference to two bulls pushing against each other's heads in a fight over dominance.&lt;ref name="History of the Bulldozer" /&gt;
* 1930s: applied to the vehicle.

These appeared as early as 1929, but were known as "bull grader" blades, and the term "bulldozer blade" did not appear to come into widespread use until the mid-1930s. "Bulldozer" now refers to the whole machine, not just the attachment. In contemporary usage, "bulldozer" is sometimes shortened to "dozer", and the verb "bulldozing" to "dozing", thus making a [[homophone]] with the pre-existing verb "[[wikt:doze|dozing]]".

The '''Chartered Institution of Civil Engineering Surveyors''' or '''ICES''' is a  professional association in the field of civil engineering surveying. ICES is now recognised as the leading chartered professional body for civil engineering surveyors. ICES members consist mainly of commercial managers and [[geospatial engineering|geospatial engineers]] working and studying within [[civil engineering]] surveying. The institution began in 1969 as the Association of Surveyors in Civil Engineering and became a registered educational charity in 1992. In 1992, ICES became the first associated institution of the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) and together formed two joint boards to provide and disseminate surveying knowledge and expertise; the Geospatial Engineering Board and Commercial Management Board. ICES also has reciprocal membership agreements in place with the ICE.

== International recognition ==
ICES is an internationally recognised qualifying body established to regulate, educate and train surveyors working within civil engineering. The headquarters are in the United Kingdom, with 11 regions consisting of volunteer-led committee members. ICES regions include  the UK, Ireland, Hong Kong and the United Arab Emirates. ICES also has memoranda of understandings agreements with many international surveying institutions and is a member of the [[International Federation of Surveyors|International Federation of Surveyors (FIG)]].

== Membership ==
Applicants for membership must demonstrate that they have fulfilled the institution's competency requirements and the general competencies plus at least one specialism must be met with and signed off by a sponsor.

Members may use designations after their names such as:
*FCInstCES for Fellow of the Chartered Institution of Civil Engineering Surveyors, Chartered Civil Engineering Surveyor.
*MCInstCES for Member of the Chartered Institution of Civil Engineering Surveyors, Chartered Civil Engineering Surveyor.

'''Christine Ann Poon''' (born c. 1952 in [[Brentwood, Missouri]]) is an American business executive.  She is the former vice chairman of [[Johnson &amp; Johnson|the Johnson &amp; Johnson]] [[board of directors|Board of Directors]] and worldwide chairman of J&amp;J's Pharmaceuticals Group.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/09/15/poon-johnson-johnson-face-markets-cx_mp_0912autofacescan05.html#3ce508486946|title=Top Female Exec Departing From J&amp;J|last=Peer|first=Melinda|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-10-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Early life ==
Poon was raised as one of seven children; her mother was a nurse, and her father a physician. In a 2013 Distinguished Lecture at [[West Virginia University]], she related how early experiences being Chinese in a predominantly white Ohio suburb shaped her character and desire to "...not be the stereotype you saw, but be who I wanted to be."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Citation|last=WVU CoBE|title=B&amp;E Distinguished Speaker Series Presents Christine Poon - Part I|date=2013-01-18|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnRVr6eugnQ|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poon credits her brother for encouraging her to pursue a career at the interface of science and business, which led to her enrollment for an MBA (1982)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=171537&amp;privcapId=185801|title=Bloomberg - Are you a robot?|website=www.bloomberg.com|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventual employment at BMS in the Strategic Planning function.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Career ==
Poon worked at [[Bristol-Myers Squibb|Bristol Myers Squibb]] from 1985 to 2000, advancing to the position of President of the international medicines division.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She credited an early role transition from a "line" to a "staff" function - Global Marketing - which exposed her to a more international vision of the pharmaceutical world and prepared her for leadership. She then joined Johnson &amp; Johnson for 8 years, from 2000 to 2008. Major projects during her time included drugs to treat pain, schizophrenia, and HIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.jnj.com/health-and-wellness/christine-poon|title=Christine Poon|date=2008-09-12|work=Content Lab - U.S.|access-date=2018-10-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After her stint with J&amp;J, Poon served as dean of [[Ohio State University]]'s [[Fisher College of Business]] from April 2009 to November 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[https://blogs.wsj.com/health/2009/01/09/jjs-poon-to-head-ohio-state-business-school/ J&amp;J’s Poon to Head Ohio State Business School], ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', January 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capital-style.com/live/content/issue/stories/2010/05/trendsetter-christine-poon.html Star Power: Christine Poon], ''Capital Style'', April 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;   She is also member of the board of directors of [[Prudential Financial]], [[Regeneron]], and [[Sherwin-Williams]], and  member of the supervisory board of [[Royal Philips Electronics]].

'''Commotion''' is a visual effects application, originally released by Puffin Designs. Puffin Designs was founded by [[Scott Squires]] (Visual Effects Supervisor at [[Industrial Light and Magic]]) and Forest Key to market Commotion.

Commotion set a high standard for a [[rotoscoping]] application, introducing [[rotosplines]] and offering features like [[Match moving|motion tracking]] and motion blurring for masks.
It was the first desktop application to allow real-time playback of full quality video clips from RAM.

Puffin Designs was later acquired by Pinnacle in 2000.  After another release, Pinnacle let the program languish.  Pinnacle has since been acquired by [[Avid Technology|Avid]], who shows no signs of reviving the product.

The last release was version 4.1.

[[Apple Computer]] briefly bundled a limited version of the program with [[Final Cut Pro]].

Before this group was formed, new [[transistor models]] were largely proprietary, which severely limited the choice of simulators that could be used.

It was formed in August, 1996, for the purpose developing and standardizing the use and implementation of SPICE models and the model interfaces. In May 2013, the [[Silicon Integration Initiative]] (Si2) and [[TechAmerica]] announced the transfer of the Compact Model Council to Si2 and a renaming to Compact Model Coalition.&lt;ref name="si2"&gt;{{Cite web

New models are submitted to the Coalition, where their technical merits are discussed, and then potential standard models are voted on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eetimes.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=175801451 | title=SIMULATION: PSP transistor tapped for standard |publisher=EETimes |author=Dylan McGrath}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="53389">'''Construction 3D Printing (c3Dp) or 3D Construction Printing (3DCP)''' refers to various technologies that use [[3D printing]] as a core method to fabricate buildings or construction components. Alternative terms are also in use, such as Large scale Additive Manufacturing (LSAM), or Freeform construction (FC), also to refer to sub-groups, such as '3D Concrete', used to refer to concrete extrusion technologies. 
[[File:The_BOD_-_Europe's_first_3D_printed_building.jpg|thumb|300x300px|The building-on-demand (BOD) by COBOD International, a small office hotel building, with a 3D printed wall and foundation structure. The first building of its kind in Europe.]]
There are a variety of 3D printing methods used at construction scale, these include the following main methods: extrusion ([[concrete]]/[[cement]], [[wax]], [[foam]], [[Polymer|polymers]]), powder bonding (polymer bond, reactive bond, [[sintering]]) and additive welding. 3D printing at a construction scale will have a wide variety of applications within the private, commercial, industrial and public sectors. Potential advantages of these technologies include faster construction, lower labor costs, increased complexity and/or accuracy, greater integration of function and less waste produced. 

A number of different approaches have been demonstrated to date which include on-site and [[off-site construction|off-site]] fabrication of buildings and construction components, using [[industrial robots]], [[gantry crane|gantry]] systems and tethered [[autonomous vehicles]]. Demonstrations of construction 3D printing technologies to date have included fabrication of housing, construction components (cladding and structural panels and columns), bridges and civil infrastructure&lt;ref&gt;Doggerel. Innovation in the build environment. Arup.[http://doggerel.arup.com/a-view-from-the-leading-edge-of-3-d-printed-infrastructure/] A view from the leading edge of 3d printed infraestructure. Interview to José Daniel García Espinel from [[Acciona]] by Maria Mingallon &lt;/ref&gt;, artificial reefs, follies and sculptures.

The technology has seen a significant increase in popularity in recent years with many new companies, including some backed up by prominent names from the construction industry and academia ([https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2018/Q4/new-3d-printed-cement-paste-gets-stronger-when-it-cracks--just-like-structures-in-nature-.html Purdue University]). This led to several important milestones, such as the first 3D printed building ([https://futureofconstruction.org/case/winsun/ Winsun]), the first 3D printed bridge ([https://d-shape.com/ D-Shape]), the first 3D printed part in a public building ([https://www.xtreee.eu/ XtreeE]), the first living 3D printed building in Europe and CIS ([https://www.specavia.pro/ Specavia]), the first 3D printed building in Europe fully approved by the authorities (COBOD International), among many others.

==History==

===Seeding technologies 1950 - 1995===

Robotic bricklaying was conceptualized and explored in the 1950s and related technology development around automated construction began in the 1960s, with pumped concrete and isocyanate foams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
  |title=Design for the Real World
  |last=Papanek
  |authorlink=Victor Papanek
  |date=1971
  |isbn=978-0897331531
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Development of automated fabrication of entire buildings using slip forming techniques and robotic assembly of components, akin to 3D printing, were pioneered in [[Japan]] to address the dangers of building high rise buildings by [[Shimizu Corporation|Shimizu]] and [[Hitachi]] in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

  |last=Architectural Design
  |authorlink= Menges, A. &amp; Hensel, M.
  |date=2008
  |isbn=9780470516874}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these early approaches to on-site automation foundered because of the construction 'bubble', their inability to respond to novel architectures and the problem of feeding and preparing materials to the site in built up areas.

===Early developments 1995 - 2000===

Early construction 3D printing development and research have been under way since 1995. Two methods were invented, one by Joseph Pegna &lt;ref&gt;J.B.Gardiner 
[https://researchbank.rmit.edu.au/view/rmit:160277/Gardiner.pdf] PhD Thesis - Exploring the Emerging Design Territory of
Construction 3D Printing (p80), 2011
&lt;/ref&gt; which was focused on a [[sand]]/cement forming technique which utilized steam to selectively bond the material in layers or solid parts, though this technique was never demonstrated.

The second technique, [[Contour Crafting]] by Behrohk Khoshnevis, initially began as a novel ceramic extrusion and shaping method, as an alternative to the emerging polymer and metal 3D printing techniques, and was patented in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Khoshnevis, [https://encrypted.google.com/patents/US5529471] Original Contour Crafting Patent US5529471 A,&lt;/ref&gt; Khoshnevis realized that this technique could exceed these techniques where "current methods are limited to fabrication of part dimensions that are generally less than one meter is each dimension". Around 2000, Khoshnevis's team at USC Vertibi began to focus on construction scale 3D printing of cementitious and ceramic pastes, encompassing and exploring automated integration of modular reinforcement, built-in plumbing and electrical services, within one continuous build process. This technology has only been tested at lab scale to date and controversially and allegedly formed the basis for recent efforts in China.
[[File:D-shape_printer.png|thumb|300x300px|One of the first versions of the D-Shape gantry printer system]]

===First generation 2000 - 2010===

In 2003, Rupert Soar secured funding and formed the freeform construction group at Loughborough University, UK, to explore the potential for up-scaling existing 3D printing techniques for construction applications. Early work identified the challenge of reaching any realistic break-even for the technology at the scale of construction and highlighted that there could be ways into the application by massively increasing the value proposition of integrated design (many functions, one component). In 2005, the group secured funding to build a large-scale construction 3D printing machine using 'off the shelf' components (concrete pumping, spray concrete, gantry system) to explore how complex such components could be and realistically meet the demands for construction.

In 2005 Enrico Dini, Italy, patented the  [[D-Shape]] technology, employing a massively scaled powder jetting/bonding technique over an area approximately 6m x 6m x 3m.&lt;ref&gt;Patent by Dini et. al, [http://www.google.com.ag/patents/WO2006100556A2?cl=en "Method and Device for Building Automatically Conglomerate Structures.

One of the most recent developments has been the printing of a bridge, the first of this kind in the world, in collaboration with [[Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia|IaaC]] and [[Acciona]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} 

In 2008 3D Concrete Printing began at [[Loughborough University]], UK, headed by Richard Buswell and colleagues to extend the groups prior research and look to commercial applications moving from a gantry based technology &lt;ref&gt;J.B.Gardiner PhD thesis [https://researchbank.rmit.edu.au/view/rmit:160277/Gardiner.pdf] "Exploring the Emerging Design Territory of

===Second generation 2010 - present===

On January 18, 2015 the company gained further press coverage with the unveiling of 2 further buildings, a mansion style villa and a 5 storey tower, using 3D printed components.&lt;ref&gt;"https://3dprint.com/38144/3d-printed-apartment-building/" web cited 2016-09-14&lt;/ref&gt; Detailed photographic inspection indicates that the buildings were fabricated with both precast and 3D printed components. The buildings stand as the first complete structures of their kind fabricated using construction 3D printing technologies. In May 2016 a new 'office building' was opened in Dubai.&lt;ref&gt;"https://3dprint.com/126426/3d-printed-museum-office/" web cited 2016-09-14&lt;/ref&gt; The 250-square-metre space (2,700 square foot) is what Dubai's Museum of the Future project is calling the world's first 3D-printed office building. In 2017 an ambitious project to build a 3D printed skyscraper in the [[United Arab Emirates]] was announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constructionweekonline.com/article-43436-cazza-to-build-worlds-first-3d-printed-skyscraper/|title=Cazza to build world's first 3D printed skyscraper}} Jochebed Menon, Construction Week Online, March 12, 2017.

FreeFAB Wax™,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FreeFAB Website|url=http://www.freefab.com|accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; invented by James B Gardiner and Steven Janssen at Laing O'Rourke (construction company). The patented technology has been in development since March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-04663-1_9" RobArch 2014 conference proceedings, Springer web cited September 14, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The technique uses construction scale 3D printing to print high volumes of engineered wax (up to 400L/hr) to fabricate a 'fast and dirty' 3D printed mould for [[precast concrete]], [[glass fibre reinforced concrete]] (GRC) and other sprayable/cast-able materials. The mould casting surface is then 5 axis milled removing approximately 5mm of wax to create a high quality mould (approximately 20 micron surface roughness).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/98665479]|title="Freefab: Development of a construction-scale robotic formwork 3D printer", Vimeo 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the component has cured, the mould is then either crushed or melted-off and the wax filtered and re-used, significantly reducing waste compared to conventional mould technologies. The benefits of the technology are fast mould fabrication speeds, increased production efficiencies, reduced labour and virtual elimination of waste by re-use of materials for bespoke moulds compared to conventional mould technologies.&lt;ref&gt;"http://www.iaarc.org/publications/fulltext/ISARC2016-Paper095.pdf, ISARC 2016"&lt;/ref&gt;

The first industrialized system is installed at a Laing O'Rourke factory in the United Kingdom and is due to start industrial production for a prominent London project in late 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[https://au.linkedin.com/in/james-bruce-gardiner-a6ab011b "Linkedin profile James B Gardiner"], Linkedin cited 2016-07-20&lt;/ref&gt;

MX3D Metal founded by Loris Jaarman and team has developed two 6 axis robotic 3D printing systems, the first uses a thermoplastic which is extruded, notably this system allows the fabrication of freeform non-planar beads. The second is a system that relies on additive welding (essentially spot welding on previous spot welds) the additive welding technology has been developed by various groups in the past, however the MX3D metal system is the most accomplished to date. MX3D are currently working toward the fabrication and installation of a metal bridge in Amsterdam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/construction-of-worlds-1st-3d-printed-bridge-begins-in-amsterdam-60110/|title=Construction of World's 1st 3D Printed Bridge Begins in Amsterdam|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The world's first serial production of construction printers was launched by [https://www.specavia.pro/ SPECAVIA] company, based in Yaroslavl (Russia). In May 2015, the company introduced the first model of a construction 3d printer and announced the start of sales. As of the beginning of 2018 the group of companies "AMT-SPEСAVIA" produces 7 models of portal construction printers: from small format (for printing small architectural forms) to large scale (for printing buildings up to 3 floors) printers. Today, the construction 3D printers of Russian production under the "AMT" trademark are operating in several countries, including, in August 2017 the first construction printer was delivered to Europe - for 3DPrinthuset (Denmark). This printer was used Copenhagen for the construction of the first 3D printed building in the EU (office-hotel of 50 m2).

The design for the Villa focused on the development of a site specific architectural language influenced by the rock formations on the site and along the coast of Sardinia, while also taking into account the use of a panellised prefabricated 3D printing process. The project went through prototyping and didn't proceed to full construction.

[[File:The_BOD_-_3D_printed_walls_of_the_structure.jpg|thumb|250x250px|The BOD - 3D printed walls of the structure]]
The [[3D Print Canal House]] was the first full-scale construction project of its kind to get off the ground. In just a short space of time, the Kamermaker has been further developed to increase its production speed by 300%. However, progress has not been swift enough to claim the title of 'World's First 3D Printed House'.&lt;ref&gt;http://rhinecapital.com/investmentinsights/3d-print-canal-house/&lt;/ref&gt;

The first residential building in Europe and the CIS, constructed using the 3D printing construction technology, was the home in Yaroslavl (Russia) with the area of 298,5 sq. m. The walls of the building were printed by the company [https://specavia.pro/ SPECAVIA] in December 2015. 600 elements of the walls were printed in the shop and assembled at the construction site. After completing the roof structure and interior decoration, the company presented a fully finished 3D building in October 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Benedict|title=AMT-SPECAVIA builds Europe's first habitable 3D printed building|url= http://www.3ders.org/articles/20171024-amt-specavia-builds-europes-first-habitable-3d-printed-building.html|website=3ders.org|accessdate=24 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The peculiarity of this project is that for the first time in the world the entire technological cycle of construction has been passed: design, obtaining a building permit, registration of the building, connection of all engineering systems. An important feature of 3D house in Yaroslavl, that also distinguishes this project from other implemented ones - this is not a presentation structure, but rather a full-fledged residential building. Today it is home of a real ordinary family.

The bridge has a total length of 12 meters and a width of 1.75 meters and is printed in micro-reinforced concrete. Architectural design was done by Institute of Advanced Architecture of Catalonia (IAAC).

The 3D printer used to build the footbridge was manufactured by [[D-Shape]]. The 3D printed bridge reflects the complexities of nature’s forms and was developed through parametric design and computational design, which allows to optimize the distribution of materials and allows to maximize the structural performance, being able to dispose the material only where it is needed, with total freedom of forms. The 3D printed footbridge of [http://www.alcobendas.org/es/portal.do;jsessionid=0C834086FD030FAFB750B88982882A2A?IDM=27&amp;NM=1 Alcobendas] represented a milestone for the construction sector at international level, as large scale 3D printing technology has been applied in this project for the first time in the field of civil engineering in a public space.

=== 3D printed architectural forms ===

In August 2018 in Palekh (old town in Russia) was the world's first application of additive technology for сreating the fountain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davide Sher|title=Ancient water fountain in Russia fully restored using 3D printing by AMT SPETSAVIA|url=https://www.3dprintingmedia.network/ancient-water-fountain-in-russia-restored-using-3d-printing-by-amt-spetsavia/|website=3dprintingmedia.network|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The fountain “Snop” (Sheaf) was originally created in the middle of the 20th century by famous sculptor Nikolai Dydykin. Nowadays, during the restoration of the fountain, it was changed from a rectangular to a round shape. The backlight system has also been updated. The restored fountain is 26 meters in diameter and 2.2 meters deep. The parapet of the 3D fountain with internal communication channels was printed by the AMT construction printer produced by AMT-SPETSAVIA group.

===Extraterrestrial printed structures===
The printing of buildings has been proposed as a particularly useful technology for constructing off-Earth habitats, such as [[Colonization of the Moon|habitats on the Moon]] or [[Colonization of Mars|Mars]]. {{asof|2013}}, the [[European Space Agency]] was working with [[London]]-based [[Foster and Partners|Foster + Partners]] to examine the potential of printing lunar bases using regular 3D printing technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Technology/Building_a_lunar_base_with_3D_printing|title=Building a lunar base with 3D printing / Technology / Our Activities / ESA|date=2013-01-31|publisher=Esa.int|accessdate=2014-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The architectural firm proposed a building-construction 3D-printer technology in January 2013 that would use lunar regolith raw materials to produce lunar building structures while using [[inflatable space habitat|enclosed inflatable habitats]] for housing the human occupants inside the hardshell printed lunar structures. Overall, these habitats would require only ten percent of the structure mass to be [[space transport|transported]] from Earth, while using local lunar materials for the other 90 percent of the structure mass.&lt;ref name="gizmodo20130131"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://gizmodo.com/5980534/this-is-what-the-first-lunar-base-could-really-look-like|title=This Is What the First Lunar Base Could Really Look Like|last=Diaz|first=Jesus|date=2013-01-31|accessdate=2013-02-01|newspaper=Gizmodo}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Lunar_base_-_ESA.jpg|thumb|270x270px|A rendering of the lunar base printing project, commissioned by the European Space Agency in collaboration with Foster + Partners]]

The building technology mixes lunar material with [[magnesium oxide]] which will turn the "[[Lunar regolith|moonstuff]] into a pulp that can be sprayed to form the block" when a [[salt|binding salt]] is applied that "converts [this] material into a stone-like solid."&lt;ref name="gizmodo20130131" /&gt; A type of [[sulfur]] [[concrete]] is also envisioned.&lt;ref name="nbf20130919" /&gt;

Tests of 3D printing of an architectural structure with [[Lunar regolith simulant|simulated lunar material]] have been completed, using a large [[vacuum chamber]] in a terrestrial lab.&lt;ref name="bbc20130201"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-21293258|title=3D printed moon building designs revealed|date=2013-02-01|accessdate=2013-02-08|newspaper=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique involves injecting the binding liquid under the surface of the [[regolith]] with a 3D printer nozzle, which in tests trapped {{convert|2|mm}}-scale droplets under the surface via [[Capillary action|capillary forces]].&lt;ref name=nbf20130919/&gt; The printer used was the [[D-Shape]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

A variety of lunar infrastructure elements have been conceived for 3D structural printing, including landing pads, blast protection walls, roads, [[hangar]]s and [[rocket propellant|fuel storage]].&lt;ref name=nbf20130919/&gt; In early 2014, [[NASA]] funded a small study at the [[University of Southern California]] to further develop 
[[File:Lunar_base_wall_-_ESA.jpg|thumb|270x270px|A 3D printed section of the lunar base made with the D-Shape technology, as commissioned by the European Space Agency]]
the ''[[Contour Crafting]]'' 3D printing technique. Potential applications of this technology include constructing lunar structures of a material that could consist of up to 90-percent [[Lunar regolith|lunar material]] with only ten percent of the material requiring [[space transport|transport]] from Earth.&lt;ref name="tf20140115"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://techflesh.com/nasas-plan-to-build-homes-on-the-moon-space-agency-backs-3d-print-technology-which-could-build-base/|title=NASA's plan to build homes on the Moon: Space agency backs 3D print technology which could build base|date=2014-01-15|newspaper=TechFlesh|accessdate=2014-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NASA is also looking at a different technique that would involve the [[sintering]] of [[Lunar regolith|lunar dust]] using low-power (1500 watt) microwave energy. The lunar material would be bound by heating to {{convert|1200|to|1500|C}}, somewhat below the melting point, in order to fuse the [[nanoparticle]] dust into a solid block that is [[ceramic]]-like, and would not require the transport of a binder material from Earth as required by the Foster+Partners, Contour Crafting, and D-shape approaches to extraterrestrial building printing. One specific proposed plan for building a lunar base using this technique would be called [[SinterHab]], and would utilize the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory|JPL]] six-legged [[ATHLETE (robot)|ATHLETE]] robot to [[Autonomous robot|autonomously]] or [[Telerobotics|telerobotically]] build lunar structures.&lt;ref name="wired20140313"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-03/01/giant-nasa-spider-moon-base-sinterhab|title=Giant Nasa spider robots could 3D print lunar base using microwaves (Wired UK)|last=Steadman|first=Ian|publisher=Wired.co.uk|accessdate=2014-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large-scale, [[cement]]-based 3D printing disposes the need for conventional [[Molding (process)|molding]] by precisely placing, or solidifying, specific volumes of material in sequential layers by a computer controlled positioning process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buswell|first=R.A.|last2=Leal de Silva|first2=W.R.|last3=Jones|first3=S.Z.|last4=Dirrenberger|first4=J.|date=October 2018|title=3D printing using concrete extrusion: A roadmap for research|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cemconres.2018.05.006|journal=Cement and Concrete Research|volume=112|pages=37–49|doi=10.1016/j.cemconres.2018.05.006|issn=0008-8846}}&lt;/ref&gt; This 3D printing approach consist of three general stages: data preparation, concrete preparation and component printing.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lim|first=S.|last2=Buswell|first2=R.A.|last3=Le|first3=T.T.|last4=Austin|first4=S.A.|last5=Gibb|first5=A.G.F.|last6=Thorpe|first6=T.|date=January 2012|title=Developments in construction-scale additive manufacturing processes|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0926580511001221|journal=Automation in Construction|volume=21|pages=262–268|doi=10.1016/j.autcon.2011.06.010|issn=0926-5805}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For path and data generation, a variety of methods are implemented for the generation of robotic building paths. A general approach is to slice a 3D shape into flat thin layers with a constant thickness which can be stacked up onto each other. In this method, each layer consists of a [[contour line]] and a filling pattern which can be implemented as [[honeycomb structures]] or [[space-filling curve|space-filling curves]]. Another method is the tangential continuity method which produces 3-dimensional building paths with locally varying thicknesses. This method results in creating constant contact surfaces between two layers, therefore, the geometrical gaps between two layers which often limits the 3D printing process will be avoided.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gosselin|first=C.|last2=Duballet|first2=R.|last3=Roux|first3=Ph.|last4=Gaudillière|first4=N.|last5=Dirrenberger|first5=J.|last6=Morel|first6=Ph.|date=2016-06-15|title=Large-scale 3D printing of ultra-high performance concrete – a new processing route for architects and builders|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/J.MATDES.2016.03.097|journal=Materials &amp; Design|volume=100|pages=102–109|doi=10.1016/j.matdes.2016.03.097|issn=0264-1275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The material preparation stage includes mixing and placing the concrete into the container. Once the fresh concrete has been placed into the container, it can be conveyed through the pump–pipe– [[nozzle]] system to print out [[Self-consolidating concrete|self-compacting concrete]] filaments, which can build layer-by-layer structural components.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Le|first=T.

These properties will all vary depending on the concrete mix design, the delivery system, and the deposition device. General specifications of wet concrete 3D printing are categorized into four main characteristics:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* '''Pumpability:''' The ease and reliability with which material is moved through the delivery system
* '''Printability:'''  The ease and reliability of depositing material through a deposition device 
* '''Buildability:''' The resistance of a deposited wet material to deformation under load
* '''Open time:''' The period where the above properties are consistent within acceptable tolerances.

In the printing step, a control system is required to execute the printing process. These systems can be generally split into two categories: [[Gantry crane|gantry]] systems and [[robotic arm]] systems. The gantry system drives a [[Manipulator (device)|manipulator]] mounted onto an overhead to locate the print nozzle in XYZ [[Cartesian coordinate system|cartesian coordinates]] while robotic arms offer additional degrees of freedom to the nozzle, allowing more accurate printing workflows such as printing with tangential continuity method.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Moreover, multiple 3D printing robotic arms can be programmed to run simultaneously resulting in decreased construction time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Xu|last2=Li|first2=Mingyang|last3=Lim|first3=Jian Hui|last4=Weng|first4=Yiwei|last5=Tay|first5=Yi Wei Daniel|last6=Pham|first6=Hung|last7=Pham|first7=Quang-Cuong|date=November 2018|title=Large-scale 3D printing by a team of mobile robots|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0926580518304011|journal=Automation in Construction|volume=95|pages=98–106|doi=10.1016/j.autcon.2018.08.004|issn=0926-5805}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, automated post-processing procedures can also be applied in scenarios which require the removal of support structures or any surface finishing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There are several research project dealing with 3D Construction printing, such as the  [https://www.tue.nl/en/university/departments/built-environment/research/research-programs/structural-design/research/research-areas/concrete-research-areas/3d-concrete-printing/ 3D concrete printing] (3DCP) project at the [[Eindhoven University of Technology]], or the various projects at the [[Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia]] ([http://pylos.iaac.net/ Pylos] , [http://www.mataerial.com/ Mataerial], and [http://robots.iaac.net/ Minibuilders]). The list of research projects is expanding even more in the last couple of years, thanks to a growing interest in the field.
[[File:BOD_printer_nozzle.jpg|thumb|320x320px|3D printer nozzle in action - Building on demand (BOD) project]]

=== State-of-the-art research ===
The majority of the projects have been focused on researching the physical aspects behind the technology, such as the printing technology, material technology, and the various issues 

related to them. COBOD International (formerly known as 3DPrinthuset, now its sister company) has recently led a research oriented towards exploring the current state of the technology worldwide, by visiting more than 35 different 3D Construction printing related projects. For each project, a research report has been issued, and the gathered data has been used to unify all the various technologies into a first attempt at a common standardized categorization and terminology. 

The researchers at Purdue University [https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2018/Q4/new-3d-printed-cement-paste-gets-stronger-when-it-cracks--just-like-structures-in-nature-.html] have pioneered a 3D printing process known as Direct-ink-Writing [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-99519-9_16] for fabrication of architectured cement-based materials for the first time [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adma.201802123]. They demonstrated using 3D-printing, bio-inspired designs of cement-based materials is feasible and novel performance characteristics such as flaw-tolerance and compliance can be achieved. 

=== First 3D Construction printing conference ===
Along with the research, [https://3dprinthuset.dk/ 3DPrinthuset] (now known as COBOD International) has organized two international conferences on 3D Construction printing (February&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://3dprint.com/163670/3d-printed-construction-conference/|title=European Institutions to Gather in Copenhagen for a Look at How 3D Printing is Disrupting Construction {{!}} 3DPrint.com {{!}} The Voice of 3D Printing / Additive Manufacturing|website=3dprint.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and November&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tctmagazine.com/3d-printing-news/3d-printhuset-second-3d-construction-printing-conference/|title=3D Printhuset organises second 3D Construction Printing Conference|date=2017-11-06|work=TCT Magazine|access-date=2017-12-11|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2017 respectively), aimed at bringing together the strongest names in this emerging industry to discuss the potentials and challenges that lie ahead. The conferences were the first of this kind, and have brought together names such as [[D-Shape]], [[Contour crafting|Contour Crafting]], [https://www.cybe.eu/ Cybe Construction], Eindhoven's 3DCP research, [https://futureofconstruction.org/case/winsun/ Winsun], and many more. Along the 3D Construction printing specialists, there has also been a strong presence from the traditional construction industry key players for the first time, with names such as [[Sika AG]], [[Vinci SA|Vinci]] , [[Royal BAM Group]], [[NCC (company)|NCC]], among others. A general idea emerged that the 3D Construction printing field needs a more unified platform where ideas, applications, issues and challenges can be shared and discussed.

=== Media interest ===

Although its the first steps have been made nearly three decades ago, 3D Construction printing has struggled to reach out for years. The first technologies to achieve some media attention were [[Contour crafting|Contour Crafting]] and [[D-Shape]], with a few sporadic articles in 2008–2012&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://phys.org/news/2008-08-usc-print-a-house-technology.html|title=USC's 'print-a-house' construction technology|access-date=2018-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/1579263/3-d-printing-whole-buildings-stonein-space-printer-rocks|title=3-D Printing Whole Buildings in Stone…in Space: This Printer Rocks|date=2010-03-11|work=Fast Company|access-date=2018-02-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://3dprinting.com/products/architecture/d-shape-3d-printer-printing-houses/|title=D-Shape: a 3D printer printing houses - 3D Printing|date=2012-04-12|work=3D Printing|access-date=2018-02-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;and a 2012 TV report.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=DShape3DPrinting|title=Discovery Channel Covers DShape 3D Printing|date=2012-09-25|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYaRUVTwIVc&amp;t=16s|accessdate=2018-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; D-Shape has also been featured in an independent documentary dedicated to its creator Enrico Dini, called "The man who prints houses"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.3ders.org/articles/20120216-the-man-who-prints-houses-documentary-about-enrico-dini-and-his-heart-and-soul-in-3d-printing-buildings.html|title=The Man Who Prints Houses - Documentary about Enrico Dini and his heart and soul in 3D printing buildings|work=3ders.org|access-date=2018-02-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

One important break-through{{when|date=March 2018}} has been seen with the announcement of the first 3D printed building, using a prefabricated 3D printed components made by [https://futureofconstruction.org/case/winsun/ Winsun], which claimed to be able to print 10 houses in a day with its technology&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gizmodo.com/how-a-chinese-company-3d-printed-ten-houses-in-a-single-1557613229|title=How a Chinese Company 3D-Printed Ten Houses In a Single Day|last=Campbell-Dollaghan|first=Kelsey|work=Gizmodo|access-date=2018-02-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Although the claims were still to be confirmed, the story has created a wide traction and a growing interest in the field. In a matter of months, many new companies began to emerge. This led to many new endeavors that reached the media, such as, in 2017, the first pedestrian 3d printed bridge&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://wonderfulengineering.com/worlds-first-3d-printed-pedestrian-bridge-pops-up-in-madrid/|title=The World’s First 3D-Printed Pedestrian Bridge Inaugurated In Madrid|date=2017-01-31|work=Wonderful Engineering|access-date=2018-02-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first cyclist 3d printed bridge,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/18/world-first-3d-printed-bridge-cyclists-netherlands|title=World's first 3D-printed bridge opens to cyclists in Netherlands|last=France-Presse|first=Agence|date=2017-10-18|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; plus an early structural element made with 3d printing in 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.3ders.org/articles/20160921-lafargeholcim-and-xtreee-successfully-3d-print-europes-first-concrete-structural-element.html|title=LafargeHolcim and XtreeE successfully 3D print Europe's first concrete structural element|work=3ders.org|access-date=2018-02-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, among many others.

Recently, COBOD International, formerly known as 3DPrinthuset (its sister company) has gained wide media attention with their first permanent 3D printed building, the first of its kind in Europe&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://3dprint.com/186860/3d-printed-building-copenhagen/|title=3D Printhuset Breaks Ground on 3D Printed Building in Copenhagen {{!}} 3DPrint.com {{!}} The Voice of 3D Printing / Additive Manufacturing|website=3dprint.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cphpost.dk/news/europes-first-3d-printed-building-erected-in-copenhagen.html|title=The Copenhagen Post - Danish News in English|website=cphpost.dk|language=DK|access-date=2018-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.constructionnews.co.uk/best-practice/technology/europes-first-3d-printed-building-arrives-in-copenhagen/10023479.article|title='Europe's first 3D-printed building' arrives in Copenhagen|work=Construction News|access-date=2018-02-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The project set an important precedent for being the first 3D printed building with a building permit and documentation in place, and a full approval from the city authorities, a crucial milestone for a wider acceptance in the construction field.

A '''current transformer''' ('''CT''') is a type of [[transformer]] that is used to measure [[alternating current]] (AC). It produces a current in its secondary which is proportional to the current in its primary.

Current transformers, along with voltage or potential transformers, are [[instrument transformer]]s. Instrument transformers scale the large values of voltage or current to small, standardized values that are easy to handle for instruments and [[protective relay]]s. The instrument transformers isolate measurement or protection circuits from the high voltage of the primary system. A current transformer provides a secondary current that is accurately proportional to the current flowing in its primary. The current transformer presents a negligible load to the primary circuit. &lt;ref name=SHEE11&gt; Donald G. Fink, H. Wayne Beatty (ed), ''Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers, Eleventh Edition'', Mc-Graw Hill,1978, 0-07-020974-X, pp. 10-51 - 10-57&lt;/ref&gt;

Current transformers are the current-sensing units of the power system and are used at generating stations, electrical substations, and in industrial and commercial electric power distribution.

==Function==
[[Image:Stromwandler Zeichnung.svg|thumb|Basic operation of current transformer]]
[[Image:SF6 current transformer TGFM-110 Russia.jpg|thumb|SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; 110 kV current transformer TGFM series, [[Russia]]]]

[[Image:Zero-phase-sequence Current Transformer.jpg|thumb|Zero-phase-sequence current transformer]]

Like any transformer, a current transformer has a primary winding, a core and a secondary winding, although some transformers, including current transformers, use an air core. In principle, the only difference between a current transformer and a voltage transformer (normal type) is that the former is fed with a [[current source|'constant' current]] while the latter is fed with a [[voltage source|'constant' voltage]], where 'constant' has the strict circuit theory meaning.

The [[alternating current]] in the primary produces an alternating [[magnetic field]] in the core, which then induces an alternating current in the secondary. The primary circuit is largely unaffected by the insertion of the CT. Accurate current transformers need close coupling between the primary and secondary to ensure that the secondary current is proportional to the primary current over a wide current range. The current in the secondary is the current in the primary (assuming a single turn primary) divided by the number of turns of the secondary. In the illustration on the right, 'I' is the current in the primary, 'B' is the magnetic field, 'N' is the number of turns on the secondary, and 'A' is an AC ammeter.

Current transformers typically consist of a [[silicon steel]] ring core wound with many turns of copper wire as shown in the illustration to the right. The conductor carrying the primary current is passed through the ring. The CT's primary, therefore, consists of a single 'turn'. The primary 'winding' may be a permanent part of the current transformer, i.e. a heavy copper bar to carry current through the core. Window-type current transformers are also common, which can have circuit cables run through the middle of an opening in the core to provide a single-turn primary winding. To assist accuracy, the primary conductor should be centered in the aperture.

CTs are specified by their current ratio from primary to secondary. The rated secondary current is normally standardized at 1 or 5&amp;nbsp;amperes. For example, a 4000:5 CT secondary winding will supply an output current of 5&amp;nbsp;amperes when the primary winding current is 4000 amperes. This ratio can also be used to find the impedance or voltage on one side of the transformer, given the appropriate value at the other side. For the 4000:5 CT, the secondary impedance can be found as {{math|Z&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} NZ&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 800Z&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and the secondary voltage can be found as {{math|V&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} NV&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 800V&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;}}. In some cases, the secondary impedance is ''referred'' to the primary side, and is found as {{math|Z&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;prime; {{=}} N&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Z&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Referring the impedance is done simply by multiplying initial secondary impedance value by the current ratio. The secondary winding of a CT can have taps to provide a range of ratios, five taps being common.&lt;ref name=SHEE11/&gt;

Current transformer shapes and sizes vary depending on the end user or switch gear manufacturer. Low-voltage single ratio metering current transformers are either a ring type or plastic molded case.

Split-core current transformers either have a two-part core or a core with a removable section. This allows the transformer to be placed around a conductor without having to disconnect it first. Split-core current transformers are typically used in low current measuring instruments, often portable, battery-operated, and hand-held (see illustration lower right).

== Use ==
[[Image:Clampmeter.jpg|thumb|Clampmeter|120px|right|Many digital [[clamp meter]]s utilize a current transformer for measuring [[alternating current]] (AC).]]
Current transformers are used extensively for measuring current and monitoring the operation of the [[power grid]]. Along with voltage leads, revenue-grade CTs drive the electrical utility's [[watt-hour meter]] on many larger commercial and industrial supplies.

High-voltage current transformers are mounted on porcelain or polymer insulators to isolate them from ground. Some CT configurations slip around the bushing of a high-voltage transformer or [[circuit breaker]], which automatically centers the conductor inside the CT window.

Current transformers can be mounted on the low voltage or high voltage leads of a power transformer. Sometimes a section of a bus bar can be removed to replace a current transformer.

Often, multiple CTs are installed as a "stack" for various uses. For example, protection devices and revenue metering may use separate CTs to provide isolation between metering and protection circuits and allows current transformers with different characteristics (accuracy, overload performance) to be used for the devices.

The burden (load) impedance should not exceed the specified maximum value to avoid the secondary voltage exceeding the limits for the current transformer. The primary current rating of a current transformer should not be exceeded or the core may enter its non linear region and ultimately [[Saturation (magnetic)|saturate]]. This would occur near the end of the first half of each half (positive and negative) of the AC sine wave in the primary and would compromise the accuracy.&lt;ref name=SHEE11/&gt;

== Safety ==
Current transformers are often used to monitor high currents or currents at high voltages. Technical standards and design practices are used to ensure the safety of installations using current transformers.

The secondary of a current transformer should not be disconnected from its burden while current is in the primary, as the secondary will attempt to continue driving current into an effective infinite [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] up to its insulation break-down voltage and thus compromise operator safety. For certain current transformers, this voltage may reach several kilovolts and may cause [[electric arc|arcing]]. Exceeding the secondary voltage may also degrade the accuracy of the transformer or destroy it. Energizing a current transformer with an open circuit secondary is equivalent to energizing a voltage transformer (normal type) with a short circuit secondary. In the first case the secondary tries to produce an infinite voltage and in the second case the secondary tries to produce an infinite current. Both scenarios can be dangerous and damage the transformer. &lt;ref name=SHEE11/&gt;

== Accuracy ==
The accuracy of a CT is affected by a number of factors including:
* Burden
* Burden class/saturation class
* Rating factor
* Load
* External [[electromagnetic field]]s
* [[Temperature]]
* Physical configuration
* The selected tap, for multi-ratio CTs
* Phase change
* Capacitive coupling between primary and secondary
* Resistance of primary and secondary
* Core magnetizing current

Accuracy classes for various types of measurement and at standard loads in the secondary circuit (burdens) are defined in IEC 61869-1 as classes 0.1, 0.2s, 0.2, 0.5, 0.5s, 1 and 3. The class designation is an approximate measure of the CT's accuracy. The ratio (primary to secondary current) error of a Class&amp;nbsp;1 CT is 1% at rated current; the ratio error of a Class&amp;nbsp;0.5 CT is 0.5% or less. Errors in phase are also important, especially in power measuring circuits. Each class has an allowable maximum phase error for a specified load impedance. &lt;ref name=SHEE11/&gt;

Current transformers used for protective relaying also have accuracy requirements at overload currents in excess of the normal rating to ensure accurate performance of relays during system faults. A CT with a rating of 2.5L400 specifies with an output from its secondary winding of twenty times its rated secondary current (usually {{math|5&amp;nbsp;A × 20 {{=}} 100&amp;nbsp;A}}) and 400&amp;nbsp;V (IZ drop) its output accuracy will be within 2.5 percent.

=== Burden ===
The secondary load of a current transformer is termed the "burden" to distinguish it from the primary load.

The burden in a CT metering [[electrical network]] is largely [[electrical resistance|resistive]] [[electrical impedance|impedance]] presented to its secondary winding. Typical burden ratings for IEC CTs are 1.5&amp;nbsp;[[volt-ampere|VA]], 3&amp;nbsp;VA, 5&amp;nbsp;VA, 10&amp;nbsp;VA, 15&amp;nbsp;VA, 20&amp;nbsp;VA, 30&amp;nbsp;VA, 45&amp;nbsp;VA and 60&amp;nbsp;VA. ANSI/IEEE burden ratings are B-0.1, B-0.2, B-0.5, B-1.0, B-2.0 and B-4.0. This means a CT with a burden rating of B-0.2 will maintain its stated accuracy with up to 0.2&amp;nbsp;[[Ohm|Ω]] on the secondary circuit. These specification diagrams show accuracy parallelograms on a grid incorporating magnitude and phase angle error scales at the CT's rated burden. Items that contribute to the burden of a current measurement circuit are switch-blocks, meters and intermediate [[electrical conductor|conductors]]. The most common cause of excess burden impedance is the conductor between the [[Electricity meter|meter]] and the CT. When substation meters are located far from the meter cabinets, the excessive length of cable creates a large resistance. This problem can be reduced by using thicker cables and CTs with lower secondary currents (1&amp;nbsp;A), both of which will produce less voltage drop between the CT and its metering devices. &lt;ref name=SHEE11/&gt;

===Knee-point core-saturation voltage===
The '''knee-point voltage''' of a current transformer is the magnitude of the secondary voltage above which the output current ceases to linearly follow the input current within declared accuracy. In testing, if a voltage is applied across the secondary terminals the [[magnetizing current]] will increase in proportion to the applied voltage, until the knee point is reached.  The knee point is defined as the voltage at which a 10% increase in applied voltage increases the magnetizing current by 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.electropedia.org/iev/iev.nsf/display?openform&amp;ievref=321-02-34|title=IEC 60050 - International Electrotechnical Vocabulary - Details for IEV number 321-02-34: "knee point voltage"|website=www.electropedia.org|access-date=2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; For voltages greater than the knee point, the magnetizing current increases considerably even for small increments in voltage across the secondary terminals. The knee-point voltage is less applicable for metering current transformers as their accuracy is generally much higher but constrained within a very small range of the current transformer rating, typically 1.2 to 1.5 times rated current. However, the concept of knee point voltage is very pertinent to protection current transformers, since they are necessarily exposed to fault currents of 20 to 30 times rated current.&lt;ref name=GEC75&gt;Anon, ''Protective Relays Application Guide Second Edition''The General Electric Company Limited of England, 1975 Section 5.3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phase shift===
Ideally, the primary and secondary currents of a current transformer should be in phase. In practice, this is impossible, but, at normal power frequencies, [[phase shift]]s of a few tenths of a degree are achievable, while simpler CTs may have phase shifts up to six degrees.&lt;ref name="ccontrolsys.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ctlsys.com/support/measurement-errors-due-to-ct-phase-shift/|title=Measurement Errors Due to CT Phase Shift –  Continental Control Systems|website=ctlsys.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; For current measurement, phase shift is immaterial as [[ammeter]]s only display the magnitude of the current. However, in [[wattmeter]]s, [[electricity meter|energy meter]]s, and [[power factor]] meters, phase shift produces errors. For power and energy measurement, the errors are considered to be negligible at unity power factor but become more significant as the power factor approaches zero. At zero power-factor, any indicated power is entirely due to the current transformer's phase error.&lt;ref name="ccontrolsys.com"/&gt;  The introduction of electronic power and energy meters has allowed current phase error to be calibrated out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ctlsys.com/support/ct_phase_angle_correction/|title=CT Phase Angle Correction –  Continental Control Systems|website=ctlsys.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special types==
Specially constructed ''[[wideband]] current transformers'' are also used (usually with an [[oscilloscope]]) to measure [[waveform]]s of [[high frequency]] or pulsed currents within [[pulsed power]] systems. Unlike CTs used for power circuitry, wideband CTs are rated in output volts per ampere of primary current.

If the burden resistance is much less than inductive impedance of the secondary winding at the measurement frequency then the current in the secondary tracks the primary current and the transformer provides a current output that is proportional to the measured current. On the other hand, if that condition is not true, then the transformer is inductive and gives a differential output. The [[Rogowski coil]] uses this effect and requires an external [[integrator]] in order to provide a voltage output that is proportional to the measured current.

==Standards==
Ultimately, depending on client requirements, there are two main standards to which current transformers are designed. IEC&amp;nbsp;61869-1 (in the past IEC&amp;nbsp;60044-1) &amp; IEEE&amp;nbsp;C57.13 (ANSI), although the Canadian and Australian standards are also recognised.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/24663|title=IEC 61869-9:2016 {{!}} IEC Webstore {{!}} LVDC|website=webstore.iec.ch|language=en|access-date=2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==High voltage types  ==
Current transformers are used for protection, measurement and control in high-voltage electrical [[Electrical substation|substations]] and the [[electrical grid]]. Current transformers may be installed inside switchgear or in apparatus bushings, but very often free-standing outdoor current transformers are used.  In a switchyard, ''live tank'' current transformers have a substantial part of their enclosure energized at the line voltage and must be mounted on insulators. ''Dead tank'' current transformers isolate the measured circuit from the enclosure. Live tank CTs are useful because the primary conductor is short, which gives better stability and a higher short-circuit current rating. The primary of the winding can be evenly distributed around the magnetic core, which gives better performance for overloads and transients. Since the major insulation of a live-tank current transformer is not exposed to the heat of the primary conductors, insulation life and thermal stability is improved.

A high-voltage current transformer may contain several cores, each with a secondary winding, for different purposes (such as metering circuits, control, or protection).&lt;ref&gt;''Protective Relays Application Guide'', (The General Electric Company Limited of England, 1975) pages 78-87&lt;/ref&gt; A neutral current transformer is used as earth fault protection to measure any fault current flowing through the neutral line from the wye neutral point of a transformer.

A '''cycloconverter''' (CCV) or a '''cycloinverter''' converts a constant voltage, constant frequency [[Alternating current|AC]] [[waveform]] to another AC waveform of a lower [[frequency]] by synthesizing the output waveform from segments of the AC supply without an intermediate DC link ({{harvnb|Dorf|1993|pp=2241–2243}} and {{harvnb|Lander|1993|p=181}}). There are two main types of CCVs, circulating current type or blocking mode type, most commercial high power products being of the blocking mode type.&lt;ref name="Klug (2005)"&gt;{{cite conference|last=Klug|first=Dieter-Rolf|author2=Klaassen, Norbert|title=High Power Medium Voltage Drives - Innovations, Portfolio, Trends|year=2005 |booktitle=European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications|doi=10.1109/EPE.2005.219669 |page=5}}&lt;!--|accessdate= Apr 29, 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Whereas phase-controlled [[silicon-controlled rectifier|SCR]] switching devices can be used throughout the range of CCVs, low cost, low-power [[TRIAC]]-based CCVs are inherently reserved for resistive load applications. The amplitude and frequency of converters' output voltage are both variable.  The output to input frequency ratio of a three-phase CCV must be less than about one-third for circulating current mode CCVs or one-half for blocking mode CCVs.{{harv|Lander|1993|p=188}}&lt;ref name="Bose 2006, p. 153"&gt;Bose (2006), p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; Output waveform quality improves as the ''pulse number'' of switching-device bridges in phase-shifted configuration increases in CCV's input.  In general, CCVs can be with 1-phase/1-phase, 3-phase/1-phase and 3-phase/3-phase input/output configurations, most applications however being 3-phase/3-phase.&lt;ref name="Bose (2006)"/&gt;

==Applications==
The competitive power rating span of standardized CCVs ranges from few megawatts up to many tens of megawatts.  CCVs are used for driving [[mine hoist]]s, rolling mill main motors,&lt;ref name="Watzmann (1996)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Watzmann|first=Marcus Watzmann|author2=Raskowetz, Steffen|title=Chinese rolling mill for extra high grade aluminium strip|date=Sep–Oct 1996|url=http://www05.abb.com/global/scot/scot271.nsf/veritydisplay/c2be0f4cc18285dac1256ddd00346eed/$file/28-33m214.pdf|accessdate=Aug 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ball mill]]s for ore processing, [[cement kiln]]s, [[ship propulsion]] systems,&lt;ref name="Pakaste (1999)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pakaste|first=Risto|title=Experience with Azipod propulsion systems on board marine vessels|date=Feb 1999|url=http://www05.abb.com/global/scot/scot271.nsf/veritydisplay/2314773146eb2d77c1256ec300341511/$file/12-18%20ENG%209902.pdf|accessdate=28 April 2012|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; slip power recovery wound-rotor induction motors (i.e., Scherbius drives) and aircraft 400&amp;nbsp;Hz power generation.&lt;ref&gt;Bose (2006), p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; The variable-frequency output of a cycloconverter can be reduced essentially to zero. This means that very large motors can be started on full load at very slow revolutions, and brought gradually up to full speed. This is invaluable with, for example, [[ball mill]]s, allowing starting with a full load rather than the alternative of having to start the mill with an empty barrel then progressively load it to full capacity. A fully loaded "hard start" for such equipment would essentially be applying full power to a stalled motor. Variable speed and reversing are essential to processes such as hot-rolling steel mills. Previously, SCR-controlled DC motors were used, needing regular brush/commutator servicing and delivering lower efficiency. Cycloconverter-driven synchronous motors need less maintenance and give greater reliability and efficiency. Single-phase bridge CCVs have also been used extensively in [[Railway electrification system|electric traction]] applications to for example produce 25&amp;nbsp;Hz power in the U.S. and 16 2/3&amp;nbsp;Hz power in Europe.&lt;ref name="Heydt (2005)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heydt|first=G.T.|author2=Chu, R.F.|title=The power quality impact of cycloconverter control strategies|journal=IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery|date=Apr 2005|volume=20|issue=2|pages=1711–1718|doi=10.1109/tpwrd.2004.834350}}&lt;!--|accessdate=Apr 29, 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ACS 6000c (1998)"&gt;{{cite web|last=ACS 6000c|title=Cycloconverter application for high performance speed and torque control of 1 to 27 MW synchronous motors|url=http://www05.abb.com/global/scot/scot216.nsf/veritydisplay/2abc426982e203e6c1256e4d004deb49/$file/acs%206000c%20cycloconverter.pdf|accessdate=29 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719013216/http://www05.abb.com/global/scot/scot216.nsf/veritydisplay/2abc426982e203e6c1256e4d004deb49/%24file/acs%206000c%20cycloconverter.pdf|archivedate=19 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas phase-controlled converters including CCVs are gradually being replaced by faster [[pulse width modulation|PWM]] self-controlled converters based on IGBT, GTO, IGCT and other switching devices, these older classical converters are still used at the higher end of the power rating range of these applications.&lt;ref name="Bose 2006, p. 153"/&gt;

==Harmonics==
CCV operation creates current and voltage ''[[harmonics]]'' on the CCV's input and output. AC line harmonics are created on CCV's input accordance to the equation,

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1232">'''Electronic oscillation''' is a repeating cyclical variation in [[voltage]] or [[electric current|current]] in an [[electrical circuit]], resulting in a periodic [[waveform]].&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/oscillation (accessed: April 01, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[frequency]] of the oscillation in [[hertz (unit)|hertz]] is the number of times the cycle repeats per second. 

The recurrence may be in the form of a varying voltage or a varying current.  The waveform may be [[sine wave|sinusoidal]] or some other shape when its magnitude is plotted against time.  Electronic oscillation may be intentionally caused, as in devices designed as [[electronic oscillator|oscillators]], or it may be the result of unintentional [[positive feedback]] from the output of an electronic device to its input.  The latter appears often in feedback [[amplifiers]] (such as [[operational amplifier]]s) that do not have sufficient [[Bode_plot#Gain_margin_and_phase_margin|gain or phase margins]]. In this case, the oscillation often interferes with or compromises the amplifier's intended function, and is known as [[parasitic oscillation]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8901">A '''flood opening''' or '''flood vent''' (also styled '''floodvent''') is an orifice in an enclosed structure intended to allow the free passage of water between the interior and exterior.

==Flood openings in the United States==
In the [[United States]], flood openings are used to provide for the automatic equalization of [[hydrostatic pressure]] on either side of a wall. [[Building codes]] usually require the installation of flood openings in the walls of structures located in [[100-year flood|A-type flood zone]]s recognized by the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]]. Various agencies in the United States define necessary characteristics for flood openings. The NFIP Regulations and Building Codes require that any residential building constructed in Flood Zone Type A have the lowest floor, including basements, elevated to or above the Base Flood Elevation (BFE). Enclosed areas are permitted under elevated buildings provided that they meet certain use restrictions and construction requirements such as the installation of flood vents to allow for the automatic entry and exit of flood waters. This wet floodproofing technique is required for residential buildings.

===Engineered vs. non-engineered openings===
Most regulatory authorities in the United States that offer requirements for flood openings define two major classes of opening:&lt;ref name="codes"&gt;[http://www.fema.gov/rebuild/buildingscience/coderesources.shtm FEMA: Building Code Resources]&lt;/ref&gt; engineered, and non-engineered. The requirements for non-engineered openings are typically stricter, defining necessary characteristics for aspects ranging from overall size of each opening, to allowable screening or other coverage options, to number and placement of openings. Engineered openings ignore many of these requirements, depending on the particular regulatory authority. To qualify as an engineered opening, testing and/or certification by a qualified agency (varying from regulator to regulator, and indicated below where appropriate) is required.

Non-Engineered Opening WARNING: "Any louvers, blades, screens, and faceplates or other covers and devices should be selected or specified so as to minimize the likelihood of blockage by small debris and sediment. Where experience has shown that a particular device or type of device has been blocked or clogged by flood debris or sediment, use of such devices should be avoided." -ASCE 24-14 Pg. 45 (commentary)

===American Society of Civil Engineers definition===
The [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] (ASCE) requirements apply to any structure that is not [[flood barrier#Local Flood Barriers|dry flood-proofed]] and which is in the [[flood insurance rate map|mapped]] flood zone. It calls for openings in [[load-bearing wall|load-bearing]] [[foundation wall]]s located below the mapped [[flood elevation]]. Where non-engineered openings are used, each opening must be at least three inches in diameter, and have no screen or other cover that interferes with the transition of water between interior and exterior. The total net open area of all flood openings in the structure must be equal to or greater than one square inch, per square foot of footprint of the enclosed area—though no fewer than two openings, total, which must be located on different walls. Openings must be placed such that the bottom of each opening is no more than one [[foot (unit)|foot]] above the adjacent ground level.&lt;ref name="ascesum"&gt;[http://www.fema.gov/library/viewRecord.do?id=3515 Highlights of ASCE 24-05 Flood Resistant Design and Construction]&lt;/ref&gt;

In lieu of these requirements, engineered openings must conform to a performance standard: during a flood with a rate of rise/fall of five feet  per hour, the difference between interior and exterior flood water levels in an enclosure using the engineered openings must not be greater than one foot.&lt;ref name="codes" /&gt;

===International Building Code (IBC)===
The [[International Building Code]] refers to the American Society of Civil Engineer requirements for both non-engineered and engineered flood openings.

===International Residential Code (IRC)===
The [[International Residential Code]] requirements vary mildly from revision to revision, but require that entry and exit of floodwater be provided for in accordance with the requirements of the ASCE.&lt;ref name="icode03"&gt;2003 International Residential Code, International Code Council, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="icode06"&gt;2006 International Residential Code, International Code Council, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="icode09"&gt;2009 International Residential Code, International Code Council, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; These requirements apply for both non-engineered and engineered flood openings.

===FEMA===
While the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] does not have [[de jure]] authority over the building code, it maintains crucial influence over flood opening standards through its administration of the [[National Flood Insurance Program]] (NFIP). By controlling the standards for nearly all [[flood insurance]] in the United States, the NFIP exerts exceptional [[de facto]] authority over many aspects of floodplain construction. The FEMA (and, thus, NFIP) requirements for non-engineered openings are similar to requirements from the American Society of Civil Engineers. Unlike the ASCE, FEMA requires the placement of openings such that the bottom of each opening is no more than one foot above the higher of the adjacent ground level, or the interior foundation slab height.&lt;ref name="tb1"&gt;[http://www.fema.gov/library/viewRecord.do?id=1579 FEMA Technical Bulletin 1-08: Openings in Foundation Walls and Walls of Enclosures]&lt;/ref&gt;

For engineered openings, FEMA offers two subclassifications: individual certification openings, and openings with [[International Code Council Evaluation Service]] (ICC-ES) Evaluation Reports. Individual certification openings are offered for use when, "[f]or architectural or other reasons, building designers or owners may prefer to use unique or individually designed openings or devices".&lt;ref name="tb1"/&gt; In such cases, an [[architect]] or [[engineer]] may provide certification including the professional's signature and applied [[seal (emblem)|seal]]. The certification must include a "statement certifying that the openings are designed to automatically equalize [[hydrostatic pressure|hydrostatic flood loads]] on exterior walls by allowing the automatic entry and exit of [[floodwater]]s in accordance with the...design requirements"; "[d]escription of the range of flood characteristics tested or computed for which the certification is valid, such as rates of rise and fall of floodwaters"; and "[d]escription of the installation requirements and limitations that, if not followed, will void the certification".&lt;ref name="tb1"/&gt; The nature of the "live seal" requirement means that each structure containing an individual certification opening must have a separate certification, even if the opening is identical to that used in another structure.

The alternative subclassification is an opening that carries certification through the ICC-ES. According to FEMA, "Evaluation Reports are issued only after the ICC-ES performs technical evaluations of documentation submitted by a manufacturer, including technical design reports, certifications, and testing that demonstrate code compliance and performance."&lt;ref name="tb1"/&gt; The report must include a statement concerning the purpose of the opening tested; a description of the characteristics tested; and a description of installation requirements. FEMA allows a copy of the report to be used as a blanket certification of any project including an ICC-ES certified opening, in contrast to the requirements of an individual certification opening.&lt;ref name="tb1"/&gt;

====AC364-1006-R1====
AC364-1006-R1 documents the ICC-ES's testing standards for flood openings, including specifications for a dual-chambered testing tank. While the requirements for the opening itself are based on ASCE 24, the substance of the test adds new layers of performance expectation. Under these requirements, the opening must activate before water level is one foot above the bottom of the opening, under conditions of 50 and 300 gallons per minute flooding, at a minimum of five foot per hour rate of rise. Additionally, water levels on the testing tank's "interior" and "exterior" portions must at no point differ more than one foot. To gauge performance against waterborne [[debris]], leaves and grass clippings are added to both chambers of the tank.&lt;ref name="ac364"&gt;[http://www.icc-es.org/Committee/0610-post/ac364.pdf AC364-1006-R1]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4184">'''Funnel analysis''' involves using a series of events that lead towards a defined goal, like from user engagement in a mobile app to a sale in an eCommerce platform or advertisement to purchase in online advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Jansen, B. J. and Schuster, S. (2011) [https://faculty.ist.psu.edu/jjansen/academic/jansen_buying_funnel_jecr.pdf Bidding on the Buying Funnel for Sponsored Search Campaigns]. Journal of Electronic Commerce Research. 12(1), 1-18.&lt;/ref&gt; The funnel analyses "are an effective way to calculate conversion rates on specific user behaviors".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Apsalar|title=Using Funnel Analysis to Measure User Conversion Rates|url=http://apsalar.com/blog/2013/01/using-funnel-analysis-to-measure-user-conversion-rates/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This can be in the form of a sale, registration, or other intended action from an audience. The origin of the term funnel analysis comes from the nature of a [[funnel]] where individuals will enter the funnel, yet only a small number of them will perform the intended goals.

For more emphasis, it makes sense why a funnel in analytics is called a funnel. An actual funnel, like the ones from a kitchen or garage, gets narrower along its length, allowing less volume to pass through it. An analytics funnel represents a very similar idea, just in regards to users on an eCommerce platform, application or online game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=CoolaData|title=Funnel Analysis|url=http://www.cooladata.com/documentation-posts-sub-categories/coolasql/coolasql-queries/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726000550/http://www.cooladata.com/documentation-posts-sub-categories/coolasql/coolasql-queries/|archivedate=2014-07-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Real world applications==

An example of how a company would use funnel analytics is by focusing on drawing actionable insights from funnels. Funnel analysis can be used to determine conversion and user fallout rates in a given funnel. An analysis to determine the steps that lead to a desired goal in order to improve future interactions in the same funnel can be done for further success. To illustrate further, looking at how many users actually make it to the end of the funnel, for example to make a purchase or register, compared with how many do not.

By continuously monitoring and analyzing funnels, it is possible to assess if changes to an application or platform are having a positive effect on conversion. For instance, one might find that only 10% of users who come to a platform and enter the registration funnel actually reach the goal of completing registration. Using the funnel analytics process, it is then possible to tweak settings or features within the funnel in order to see what makes that number improve. Or when creating a marketing campaign, there is a chance to analyze how well the campaign is working by monitoring a funnel that brings users from the initial event all the way to purchasing a product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=CoolaData|title=Funnels|url=http://www.cooladata.com/blog/funnels/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Funnel analysis helps determine the point in which users are dropping off. The next step is to understand why they’re dropping off, in order to reduce drop off rates and in turn increase overall conversion.

'''Gas volume corrector''' - device for calculating, summing and determining increments of gas volume, measured by [[gas meter]] if it were operating [[base conditions]]. For this purpose, uses as input the gas volume, measured by the gas meter and other parameters such as: gas [[pressure]] and temperature. It is used for the settlement of trade wholesale gas.

There are two types of gas volume correctors:

'''Type 1'''- gas volume corrector with specific types of transducers for pressure and temperature or temperature only. This type of gas volume corrector is powered by battery.

'''Type 2''' - a device that converts separate transmitters with external temperature and pressure, or temperature only and for separate calculator, which may be approved separately. This type of gas volume corrector is powered by mains.

[[File:Airbus A380 cockpit.jpg|thumb|The [[Airbus A380]] glass cockpit featuring "pull out keyboards and two wide computer screens on the sides for pilots"&lt;ref name="Chui"/&gt;]]

A '''glass cockpit''' is an [[aircraft cockpit]] that features electronic (digital) [[flight instrument]] [[display device|display]]s, typically large [[liquid-crystal display|LCD]] screens, rather than the traditional style of [[Analog device|analog]] dials and gauges. While a traditional cockpit (nicknamed a "steam cockpit" within aviation circles) relies on numerous mechanical gauges to display information, a glass cockpit uses several displays driven by [[flight management system]]s, that can be adjusted ([[multi-function display]]) to display flight information as needed. This simplifies aircraft operation and navigation and allows [[aviator|pilots]] to focus only on the most pertinent information. They are also popular with airline companies as they usually eliminate the need for a [[flight engineer]], saving costs. In recent years the technology has also become widely available in small aircraft.

As aircraft displays have modernized, the sensors that feed them have modernized as well. Traditional [[gyroscope|gyroscopic]] [[flight instrument]]s have been replaced by electronic [[attitude and heading reference system]]s (AHRS) and [[air data computer]]s (ADCs), improving reliability and reducing cost and maintenance. [[GPS]] receivers are usually integrated into glass cockpits.

Early glass cockpits, found in the [[McDonnell Douglas MD-80]]/[[McDonnell Douglas MD-90|90]], [[Boeing 737 Classic]], [[Boeing 757|757]] and [[Boeing 767|767-200/-300]], [[ATR 42]], [[ATR 72]] and in the Airbus [[Airbus A300|A300-600]] and [[Airbus A310|A310]], used [[Electronic Flight Instrument System]]s (EFIS) to display attitude and navigational information only, with traditional mechanical gauges retained for airspeed, altitude, vertical speed, and engine performance. Later glass cockpits, found in the Boeing [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|737NG]], [[Boeing 747-400|747-400]], [[Boeing 767|767-400]], [[Boeing 777|777]], [[Airbus A320 family|A320]] and later Airbuses, [[Ilyushin Il-96]] and [[Tupolev Tu-204]] have completely replaced the mechanical gauges and warning lights in previous generations of aircraft. While glass cockpit-equipped aircraft throughout the late 20th century still retained analog [[altimeter]]s, [[Attitude indicator|attitude]], and [[airspeed indicator]]s as standby instruments in case the EFIS displays failed, more modern aircraft have been increasingly been using digital standby instruments as well, such as the [[Integrated standby instrument system]].

== History ==
{{Double image|right|C-5A Cockpit.jpg|220|C-5M Cockpit.jpg|220|Analog instrument panel of a [[C-5 Galaxy|C-5A]]|Upgraded "glass" [[C-5M]] instrument panel}}

Glass cockpits originated in military aircraft in the late 1960s and early 1970s; an early example is the Mark II avionics of the F-111D (first ordered in 1967, delivered from 1970–73), which featured a [[multi-function display]].

Prior to the 1970s, air transport operations were not considered sufficiently demanding to require advanced equipment like electronic flight displays. Also, computer technology was not at a level where sufficiently light and powerful [[electrical network|circuits]] were available. The increasing complexity of transport aircraft, the advent of digital systems and the growing air traffic congestion around [[airport]]s began to change that.

The [[Boeing 2707]] was one of the earliest commercial aircraft designed with a glass cockpit. Most cockpit instruments were still analog, but [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] displays were to be used for the [[Attitude indicator]] and [[Horizontal situation indicator|HSI]]. However, the 2707 was cancelled in 1971 after insurmountable technical difficulties and ultimately the end of project funding by the US government.

The average transport aircraft in the mid-1970s had more than one hundred cockpit instruments and controls, and the primary flight instruments were already crowded with indicators, crossbars, and symbols, and the growing number of cockpit elements were competing for cockpit space and pilot attention.&lt;ref name="Wallace"/&gt; As a result, [[NASA]] conducted research on displays that could process the raw aircraft system and flight data into an integrated, easily understood picture of the flight situation, culminating in a series of flights demonstrating a full glass cockpit system.

The success of the NASA-led glass cockpit work is reflected in the total acceptance of electronic flight displays beginning with the introduction of the [[MD-80]] in [[1979 in aviation|1979]]. Airlines and their passengers alike have benefited. The safety and efficiency of flights have been increased with improved pilot understanding of the aircraft's situation relative to its environment (or "[[situational awareness]]").

By the end of the 1990s, [[liquid-crystal display]] (LCD) panels were increasingly favored among aircraft manufacturers because of their efficiency, reliability and legibility. Earlier LCD panels suffered from poor legibility at some viewing angles and poor response times, making them unsuitable for aviation. Modern aircraft such as the [[Boeing 737 Next Generation]], [[Boeing 777|777]], [[Boeing 717|717]], [[Boeing 747-400|747-400ER]], [[Boeing 747-8I|747-8F]] [[Boeing 767|767-400ER]], [[Boeing 747-8|747-8]], and [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner|787]], [[Airbus A320 family]] (later versions), [[Airbus A330|A330]] (later versions), [[Airbus A340|A340-500/600]], [[Airbus A340|A340-300]] (later versions), [[Airbus A380|A380]] and [[Airbus A350|A350]] are fitted with glass cockpits consisting of LCD units.&lt;ref name="A320"/&gt;

The glass cockpit has become standard equipment in [[airliner]]s, [[business jets]], and [[military aircraft]]. It was fitted into NASA's [[Space Shuttle]] orbiters [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']], [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']], [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']], and [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], and the current Russian [[Soyuz spacecraft|Soyuz]] TMA model spacecraft that was launched in 2002. By the end of the century glass cockpits began appearing in [[general aviation]] aircraft as well. In 2003, [[Cirrus Design]]'s [[Cirrus SR20|SR20]] and [[Cirrus SR22|SR22]] became the first [[light aircraft]] equipped with glass cockpits, which they made standard on all Cirrus aircraft. By [[2005 in aviation|2005]], even basic trainers like the [[Piper Cherokee]] and [[Cessna 172]] were shipping with glass cockpits as options (which nearly all customers chose), as well as many modern aircraft such as the [[Diamond DA42]] twin-engine travel and training aircraft. The [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II]] features a "panoramic cockpit display" touchscreen that replaces most of the switches and toggles found in an aircraft cockpit. The civilian [[Cirrus Vision SF50]] now has the same, which they call a "Perspective Touch" glass cockpit.

== Uses ==

=== Commercial aviation ===
[[File:15-07-14-Suchoj-Superjet-100-RalfR-WMA 0547-0550.jpg|thumb|[[Sukhoi Superjet 100]] glass cockpit]]

Unlike the previous era of glass cockpits—where designers merely copied the look and feel of conventional electromechanical instruments onto cathode ray tubes—the new displays represent a true departure. They look and behave very similarly to other computers, with windows and data that can be manipulated with point-and-click devices. They also add terrain, approach charts, weather, vertical displays, and 3D navigation images.

The improved concepts enable aircraft makers to customize cockpits to a greater degree than previously. All of the manufacturers involved have chosen to do so in one way or another—such as using a [[trackball]], thumb pad or [[joystick]] as a pilot-input device in a computer-style environment. Many of the modifications offered by the aircraft manufacturers improve situational awareness and customize the human-machine interface to increase safety.

Modern glass cockpits might include Synthetic Vision (SVS) or Enhanced Vision systems (EVS). Synthetic Vision systems display a realistic 3D depiction of the outside world (similar to a [[flight simulator]]), based on a database of terrain and geophysical features in conjunction with the attitude and position information gathered from the aircraft navigational systems. Enhanced Vision systems add real-time information from external sensors, such as an infrared camera.

All new airliners such as the [[Airbus A380]], [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner|Boeing 787]] and private jets such as [[Bombardier Global Express]] and [[Learjet]] use glass cockpits.

=== General aviation ===
[[File:Cessna T182T Cockpit - Garmin G1000.jpg|thumb|[[Garmin G1000]] displays in a [[Cessna 182]]. Note the three analog standby instruments near the bottom of the main instrument panel.]]

Many modern [[general aviation]] aircraft are available with glass cockpits. Systems such as the [[Garmin G1000]] are now available on many new [[general aviation|GA]] aircraft, including the classic [[Cessna 172]]. Many small aircraft can also be modified post-production to replace analogue instruments.

Glass cockpits are also popular as a retrofit for older private jets and turboprops such as [[Dassault Falcon]]s, [[Hawker Beechcraft#Products|Raytheon Hawkers]], [[Bombardier Challenger]]s, [[Cessna Citation family|Cessna Citations]], [[Gulfstream Aerospace#Products|Gulfstreams]], [[Beechcraft King Air|King Airs]], [[Learjet#Aircraft|Learjets]], [[IAI Astra|Astras]], and many others. Aviation service companies work closely with equipment manufacturers to address the needs of the owners of these aircraft.

=== Consumer, research, hobby &amp; recreational aviation ===

Today, smartphones and tablets use mini-applications, or "apps," to remotely control complex devices, by WiFi radio interface. They demonstrate how the "glass cockpit" idea is being applied to consumer devices. Applications include toy-grade [[UAV]]s which use the display and touch screen of a tablet or smartphone to employ every aspect of the "glass cockpit" for instrument display, and [[fly-by-wire]] for aircraft control.

=== NASA Space Shuttle program ===
[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|The [[Space Shuttle]] glass cockpit]]

The glass cockpit idea made news in 1980s trade magazines, like [[Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology]], when NASA announced that it would be replacing most of the electro-mechanical flight instruments in the space shuttles with glass cockpit components. The articles mentioned how glass cockpit components had the added benefit of being a few hundred pounds lighter than the original flight instruments and support systems used in the space shuttles.

== Safety ==

As aircraft operation depends on glass cockpit systems, flight crews must be trained to deal with possible failures.&lt;ref name="planeandpilotmag1"/&gt; The [[Airbus A320 family]] has seen fifty incidents where several flight displays were lost.&lt;ref name="NTSB safety recommendation A08-53"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.ntsb.gov/safety/safety-recs/recletters/A08_53_55.pdf |publisher= National Transportation Safety Board |title= Safety Recommendation A08-53 |date= July 22, 2008 |quote= According to Airbus, as of May 2007, 49 events similar to the United Airlines flight 731 and UK events had occurred in which the failure of electrical busses resulted in the loss of flight displays and various aircraft systems. |page= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 January 2008 [[United Airlines]] Flight 731 experienced a serious glass-cockpit blackout, losing half of the [[Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitor|ECAM]] displays as well as all radios, transponders, [[Traffic collision avoidance system|TCAS]], and attitude indicators.&lt;ref name="planeandpilotmag1"/&gt; The pilots were able to land at Newark Airport without radio contact in good weather and daylight conditions.

Airbus has offered an optional fix, which the US [[NTSB]] has suggested to the US [[FAA]] as mandatory, but the FAA has yet to make it a requirement.&lt;ref name="typepad1"/&gt; A preliminary NTSB factsheet is available.&lt;ref name="DCA08IA033"/&gt; Due to the possibility of a blackout, glass cockpit aircraft also have an [[integrated standby instrument system]] that includes (at a minimum) an [[artificial horizon]], [[altimeter]] and [[airspeed indicator]]. It is [[Electronics|electronically]] separate from the main instruments and can run for several hours on a backup battery.

In 2010, the [[National Transportation Safety Board|NTSB]] published a study done on 8,000 general aviation light aircraft. The study found that, although aircraft equipped with glass cockpits had a lower overall accident rate, they also had a larger chance of being involved in a fatal accident.&lt;ref name="NTSB Safety"/&gt; The NTSB Chairman said in response to the study:
{{quote|Training is clearly one of the key components to reducing the accident rate of light planes equipped with glass cockpits, and this study clearly demonstrates the life and death importance of appropriate training on these complex systems... While the technological innovations and flight management tools that glass cockpit equipped airplanes bring to the general aviation community should reduce the number of fatal accidents, we have not—unfortunately—seen that happen.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4464">'''HCMOS''' ("high-speed [[CMOS]]") is the set of specifications for electrical ratings and characteristics, forming the 74HC00 family, a part of the [[7400 series]] of [[integrated circuits]].&lt;ref name="philips"&gt;[http://www.standardics.nxp.com/support/documents/logic/pdf/family.hcmos.specification.pdf HCMOS family characteristics]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720001502/http://www.standardics.nxp.com/support/documents/logic/pdf/family.hcmos.specification.pdf |date=2008-07-20 }}, Philips Semiconductors, March 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

The 74HC00 family followed, and improved upon, the 74C00 series (which provided an alternative CMOS logic family to the [[4000 series]] but retained the part number scheme and pinouts of the standard [[7400 series]] (especially the 74LS00 series) .

'''Hermann Hammesfahr''' (February 20, 1845 – November 23, 1914) was a Prussian-American inventor who invented a type of [[fiberglass]] cloth in which glass was interwoven with [[silk]]. He was awarded the [[patent]] by the United States Patent Office in 1880.&lt;ref name="Birth of Fiberglass"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mitchell|first=Steve|title=The birth of fiberglass boats|journal=The Good Ole Boat|date=November 1999|volume=2|issue=6|url=http://www.goodoldboat.com/reader_services/articles/birthoffiberglass.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Patent2&gt;{{cite web|title=Entry for US 232122 A (14-Sep-1880)|url=http://ip.com/pat/US232122|publisher=US Patent Publication|accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;This was the earliest fiberglass of any kind that is known to have been patented or produced. 

== Family origins ==
Hammesfahr was born in Evangelisch, Flachsberg, Wald Solingen, Rhineland, [[Prussia]] and died in [[Brooklyn]], Kings County, [[New York (state)|New York]]—the son of Carl Wilhelm Hammesfahr (1811–1878) and Caroline Wilhelmine Remschied (1806–1878). The Hammesfahr family is an old Solingen steel family tracing its roots back to the medieval armorer's guild.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trees.ancestry.com/tree/42940/person/-2139615009?pgNum=1|publisher=Ancestry.com |title = Hammesfahr Family}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The "grandfather" of fiber optics ==
[[File:Hermann Hammesfahr.png|thumb|Hermann Hammesfahr appears center front, with family.]]

This patent and a number of associated patents also provided the practical foundation for the development and production of [[Optical fiber|fiber optics]] (Hammesfahr has been called “the grandfather of fiber optics”){{citation needed|date=October 2013}} and [[fiberglass]]. All were purchased by the Libbey Glass Company in [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], [[Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Velte|first=Robert C. Elsenpeter, Toby J.|title=Optical networking a beginner's guide|year=2002|publisher=McGraw-Hill/Osborne|location=Berkeley, California|isbn=0072228105|page=43|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I3fPDb7NHUsC&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;ots=ku-v4-jDsh&amp;dq=%22herman%20hammesfahr%22&amp;pg=PA43#v=onepage&amp;q=%22herman%20hammesfahr%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An immigrant from Prussia, he was known for his keen aesthetic achievements and technical innovations, which have proven recently to be historically seminal, until recently, Hermann Hammesfahr and his contributions have been obscured, buried in scientific journals and first-hand historical accounts—and in many cases erroneously attributed to others, such as Edward Drummond Libbey himself, owner of the Libbey Glassworks.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

== 1892 Chicago World's Fair ==
Libbey Glass purchased the fiberglass patent among others from Hammesfahr with the intention of displaying the fabric in a spectacular manner at the 1892 [[World's Columbian Exposition|Chicago World's Fair]]. At first, the company wove [[Lampshade|lamp shades]] from the glass fabric. Then it caught the eye of actress Georgia Cayven who requested a dress be made from it. Hammesfahr designed a dress and the Libby Glass company showed it off at the 1892 World's Fair.&lt;ref name="City of Light"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hecht|first=Jeff|title=City of light : the story of fiber optics|year=1999|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|location=New York, NY [u.a.]|isbn=0195108183|pages=31–32 |edition=Rev. and expanded ed., paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The dress was a sensation. Edison’s electric lightbulb also debuted at the Fair, as well as the Ferris Wheel; however contemporary accounts indicate it was the Glass Dress that attracted the attention of women across America.

== Flexible Glass Fabric ==
Many onlookers were impressed by the dress at the 1892 World's Fair and a copy was purchased for $30,000 by Princess Eulalie of [[Spain]]. However, the dress reportedly impractical and no one else is known to have bought another dress. Hammesfahr's granddaughter modeled a glass dress her mother had made at the 1904 [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition|St. Louis World's Fair]] and reported that the dress scratched and was fragile. Despite this, the dresses, neckties, and other attire made from the glass fabric succeeded in publicizing the flexible glass thread technology. Hammesfahr's creation inspired new, innovative uses for glass fabric. It could withstand corrosive chemicals so chemists and druggist used it to filter solid particles out of liquid. Tangled glass fibers, [[glass wool]], made a great insulator and was used by industry to surround steam pipes. Glass fabric was even used as [[bandages]].&lt;ref name="City of Light"/&gt;

[[Spaceflight]] began in the 20th century following theoretical and practical breakthroughs by [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]] and [[Robert H. Goddard]]. The [[Soviet Union]] took the lead in the post-war [[Space Race]], launching the first [[satellite]], the first man and the first woman into [[orbit]]. The United States caught up with, and then passed, their Soviet rivals during the mid-1960s, landing the first man on the Moon in 1969. In the same period, France, the United Kingdom, Japan and China were concurrently developing more limited launch capabilities.

Following the end of the Space Race, spaceflight has been characterised by greater international co-operation, cheaper access to [[low Earth orbit]] and an expansion of commercial ventures. Interplanetary probes have visited all of the planets in the [[Solar System]], and humans have remained in orbit for long periods aboard space stations such as ''[[Mir]]'' and the [[International Space Station|ISS]]. Most recently, China has emerged as the third nation with the capability to launch independent manned missions, whilst operators in the commercial sector have developed re-usable booster systems and craft launched from airborne platforms.

==Background==
[[File:Noordung space station.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Description of a space station in [[Hermann Noordung]]'s ''The Problem of Space Travel'' (1929).]]

At the beginning of the 20th century, there was a burst of scientific investigation into interplanetary travel, inspired by fiction by writers such as [[Jules Verne]] (''[[From the Earth to the Moon]]'', ''[[Around the Moon]]'') and [[H.G. Wells]] (''[[The First Men in the Moon]]'', ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'').

The first realistic proposal of spaceflight goes back to Konstantin Tsiolkovsky. His most famous work, "{{lang|ru|Исследование мировых пространств реактивными приборами}}" (''Issledovanie mirovikh prostranstv reaktivnimi priborami'', or ''The Exploration of Cosmic Space by Means of Reaction Devices''), was published in 1903, but this theoretical work was not widely influential outside Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g8PW0_WNTDsC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=Noordung+space+station#PPA4,M1|title=Walking in Space|first=David|last=Shayler|date=3 June 2004|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|page=4|access-date=19 January 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spaceflight became an engineering possibility with the work of Robert H. Goddard's publication in 1919 of his paper "[[Robert H. Goddard#A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes|A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes]]", where his application of the [[de Laval nozzle]] to [[liquid fuel rocket]]s gave sufficient power for interplanetary travel to become possible.  This paper was highly influential on [[Hermann Oberth]] and [[Wernher Von Braun]], later key players in spaceflight.

In 1929, the [[Slovenes|Slovene]] officer [[Hermann Noordung]] was the first to imagine a complete space station in his book ''The Problem of Space Travel''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Story of Manned Space Stations'', 2007, by Philip Baker, SpringerLink p.2 [https://books.google.com/books?id=DdgIMOmcG0wC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=Noordung+space+station]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g8PW0_WNTDsC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=Noordung+space+station|title=Walking in Space|first=David|last=Shayler|date=3 June 2004|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|page=6|access-date=19 January 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first rocket to reach space was a German [[V-2]] rocket, on a [[Spaceflight before 1951#1944|vertical test flight]] in June 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Dornberger, Moewig, Berlin 1984. {{ISBN|3-8118-4341-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war ended, the research and development branch of the (British) Ordinance Office organised ''[[Operation Backfire (WWII)|Operation Backfire]]'' which, in October 1945, assembled enough V-2 missiles and supporting components to enable the launch of three (possibly four, depending on source consulted) of them from a site near Cuxhaven in northern Germany. Although these launches were inclined and the rockets didn't achieve the altitude necessary to be regarded as [[sub-orbital spaceflight]], the Backfire report remains the most extensive technical documentation of the rocket, including all support procedures, tailored vehicles and fuel composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Operation Backfire Tests at Altenwalde/Cuxhaven|url=http://www.v2rocket.com/start/chapters/backfire.html|publisher=V2Rocket.com|accessdate=31 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, the [[British Interplanetary Society]] proposed an enlarged man-carrying version of the V-2 called ''Megaroc''. The plan, written in 1946, envisaged a three-year development programme culminating in the launch of test pilot [[Eric Brown (pilot)|Eric Brown]] on a sub-orbital mission in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How a Nazi rocket could have put a Briton in space|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150824-how-a-nazi-rocket-could-have-put-a-briton-in-space|work=BBC|accessdate=31 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Megaroc|url=http://www.bis-space.com/what-we-do/projects/megaroc|work=BIS|access-date=31 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision by the Ministry of Supply under [[Clement Attlee|Attlee]]'s government to concentrate on research into [[nuclear power]] generation and sub-sonic passenger jet aircraft over supersonic atmospheric flight and spaceflight delayed the introduction of both of the latter (although only by a year in the case of supersonic flight, as the data from the [[Miles M.52]] was handed to [[Bell Aircraft]].

==Space Race==
{{Main|Space Race}}
Over a decade after the ''Megaroc'' proposal, true orbital space flight, both unmanned and manned, was developed by the Soviet Union and the United States during the [[Cold War]], in a competition dubbed the ''Space Race''.

===First unmanned satellite===
{{Main|Sputnik 1}}
[[File:Sputnik 1.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A replica of [[Sputnik 1]] on display.]]
The race began in 1957, when both the US and the USSR made statements announcing they planned to launch artificial [[satellites]] during the 18 month long [[International Geophysical Year]] of July 1957 to December 1958. On July 29, 1957, the US announced a planned launch of the [[Project Vanguard|Vanguard]] by the spring of 1958, and on July 31, the USSR announced it would launch a satellite in the fall of 1957.

On October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union launched [[Sputnik 1]], the first artificial satellite of Earth in the history of mankind.

On November 3, 1957, the Soviet Union launched the second satellite, [[Sputnik 2]], and the first to carry a living animal, a dog named [[Laika]]. [[Sputnik 3]] was launched on May 15, 1958, and carried a large array of instruments for geophysical research and provided data on pressure and composition of the upper atmosphere, concentration of charged particles, photons in cosmic rays, heavy nuclei in cosmic rays, magnetic and electrostatic fields, and meteoric particles.

After a series of failures with the program, the US succeeded with [[Explorer 1]], which became the first US satellite in space, on February 1, 1958. This carried scientific instrumentation and detected the theorized [[Van Allen radiation belt]].

The US public shock over Sputnik 1 became known as the [[Sputnik crisis]]. On July 29, 1958, the [[United States Congress|US Congress]] passed legislation turning the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA) into the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) with responsibility for the nation's civilian space programs. In 1959, NASA began [[Project Mercury]] to launch single-man capsules into Earth orbit and chose a corps of seven  [[astronaut]]s introduced as the ''[[Mercury Seven]]''.

===First man in space===
{{main|Vostok programme}}
[[File:Gagarin in Sweden.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Yuri Gagarin]]]]

On April 12, 1961, the USSR opened the era of manned spaceflight, with the flight of the first ''cosmonaut'' (Russian name for space travelers),  [[Yuri Gagarin]]. Gagarin's flight, part of the Soviet [[Vostok programme|Vostok]] space exploration program, took 108 minutes and consisted of a single  [[orbit]] of the Earth.

On August 7, 1961, [[Gherman Titov]], another Soviet cosmonaut, became the second man in orbit during his [[Vostok 2]] mission.

By June 16, 1962, the Union launched a total of six Vostok cosmonauts, two pairs of them flying concurrently, and accumulating a total of 260 cosmonaut-orbits and just over sixteen cosmonaut-days in space.

On May 5, 1961, the US launched its first [[suborbital]] Mercury astronaut, [[Alan Shepard]], in the [[Freedom 7]] capsule. The US public was becoming increasingly shocked and alarmed at the widening lead obtained by the USSR, so [[President of the United States|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] announced on May 25 a plan to land a man on the moon by 1970, launching the three-man [[Apollo program]].

On February 20, 1962, the US succeeded in launching the third manned orbital spaceflight in history, with [[John Glenn]], the first US orbital astronaut, making three orbits during his [[Friendship 7]] mission. By May 16, 1963, the US launched a total of six Project Mercury astronauts, logging a cumulative 34 Earth orbits, and 51 hours in space.

===First woman in space===
[[File:Valentina Tereshkova, world's first woman astronaut, from RIAN archives.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Valentina Tereshkova]]]]

The first woman in space was former civilian parachutist [[Valentina Tereshkova]], who entered orbit on June 16, 1963, aboard the Soviet mission [[Vostok 6]]. The chief Soviet spacecraft designer, [[Sergey Korolyov]], conceived of the idea to recruit a female cosmonaut corps and launch two women concurrently on Vostok 5/6. However, his plan was changed to launch a male first in [[Vostok 5]], followed shortly afterward by Tereshkova. Khrushchev personally spoke to Tereshkova by radio during her flight.&lt;ref name="gatland_tereshkova"&gt;

On November 3, 1963, Tereshkova married fellow cosmonaut [[Andrian Nikolayev]], who had previously flown on [[Vostok 3]].&lt;ref&gt;Gatland (1976), p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; On June 8, 1964, she gave birth to the first child conceived by two space travelers.&lt;ref&gt;Gatland (1976), p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; The couple divorced in 1982, and Tereshkova went on to become a prominent member of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]].

The second woman to fly to space was aviator [[Svetlana Savitskaya]], aboard [[Soyuz T-7]] on August 18, 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spacefacts.de/bios/cosmonauts/english/savitskaya_svetlana.htm|title=Cosmonaut Biography: Svetlana Savitskaya|first=Joachim|last=Becker|website=www.SpaceFacts.de|access-date=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sally Ride]] became the first American woman in space when she flew aboard [[Space Shuttle]] mission [[STS-7]] on June 18, 1983. Women space travelers went on to become commonplace during the 1980s.

[[Helen Sharman]] became the first European woman in space aboard the Soyuz TM-12 on May 18, 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/About_Us/Welcome_to_ESA/ESA_history/50_years_of_humans_in_space/European_women_in_space|title=European women in space|last=|first=|date=|website=European Space Agency|access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Competition develops===
Khrushchev pressured Korolyov to quickly produce greater space achievements in competition with the announced Gemini and Apollo plans. Rather than allowing him to develop his plans for a crewed [[Soyuz spacecraft]], he was forced to make modifications to squeeze two or three men into the [[Vostok spacecraft|Vostok capsule]], calling the result [[Voskhod spacecraft|Voskhod]]. Only two of these were launched. [[Voskhod 1]] was the first spacecraft with a crew of three, who could not wear [[space suit]]s because of size and weight constrictions. [[Alexei Leonov]] made the first [[spacewalk]] when he left the [[Voskhod 2]] on March 8, 1965. He was almost lost in space when he had extreme difficulty fitting his inflated space suit back into the cabin through an [[airlock]], and a landing error forced him and his crewmate to be lost in dangerous woods for hours before being found by the recovery crew.

The start of manned Gemini missions was delayed a year later than NASA had planned, but ten largely successful missions were launched in 1965 and 1966, allowing the US to overtake the Soviet lead by achieving [[space rendezvous]] ([[Gemini 6A]]) and docking ([[Gemini 8]]) of two vehicles, long duration flights of eight days ([[Gemini 5]]) and fourteen days ([[Gemini 7]]), and demonstrating the use of [[extra-vehicular activity]] to do useful work outside a spacecraft ([[Gemini 12]]).

The USSR made no manned flights during this period but continued to develop its Soyuz craft and secretly accepted Kennedy's implicit lunar challenge, designing Soyuz variants for lunar orbit and landing. They also attempted to develop the [[N1 (rocket)|N1]], a large, manned moon-capable launch vehicle similar to the US [[Saturn V]].

As both nations rushed to get their new spacecraft flying with men, the intensity of the competition caught up to them in early 1967, when they suffered their first crew fatalities. On January 27, the entire crew of [[Apollo 1]], [[Gus Grissom|"Gus" Grissom]], [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]], and [[Roger Chaffee]], were killed by suffocation in a fire that swept through their cabin during a ground test approximately one month before their planned launch. On April 24, the single pilot of [[Soyuz 1]], [[Vladimir Mikhaylovich Komarov|Vladimir Komarov]], was killed in a crash when his landing parachutes tangled, after a mission cut short by electrical and control system problems. Both accidents were determined to be caused by design defects in the spacecraft, which were corrected before manned flights resumed.

[[File:As11-40-5886.jpg|thumb|left|Neil Armstrong works at the LM in one of the few photos taken of him from the lunar surface. [[NASA]] photo AS11-40-5886.]]
[[File:Aldrin Apollo 11 original.jpg|thumb|Buzz Aldrin poses on the Moon, allowing Neil Armstrong to photograph both of them using the visor's reflection.]]
The US succeeded in achieving President Kennedy's goal on July 20, 1969, with the landing of [[Apollo 11]]. [[Neil Armstrong]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]] became the first men to set foot on the Moon. Six such successful landings were achieved through 1972, with one failure on [[Apollo 13]].

The N1 rocket suffered four catastrophic unmanned launch failures between 1969 and 1972, and the Soviet government officially discontinued its manned lunar program on June 24, 1974, when [[Valentin Glushko]] succeeded Korolyov as General Spacecraft Designer.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book | title = Challenge To Apollo The Soviet Union and The Space Race, 1945-1974 | last = Siddiqi | first = Asif | publisher = NASA | url = https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?Ntk=all&amp;Ntx=mode%20matchall&amp;Ntt=SP-2000-4408 | page = 832}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both nations went on to fly relatively small, non-permanent manned space laboratories [[Salyut program|Salyut]] and [[Skylab]], using their Soyuz and Apollo craft as shuttles. The US launched only one Skylab, but the USSR launched a total of seven "Salyuts", three of which were secretly [[Almaz]] military manned reconnaissance stations, which carried "defensive" cannons. Manned reconnaissance stations were found to be a bad idea since unmanned satellites could do the job much more cost-effectively. The  [[United States Air Force]] had planned a manned reconnaissance station, the [[Manned Orbital Laboratory]], which was cancelled in 1969. The Soviets cancelled Almaz in 1978.

In a season of [[detente]], the two competitors declared an end to the race and shook hands (literally) on July 17, 1975, with the [[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project]], where the two craft docked, and the crews exchanged visits.

{{main|Space Shuttle}}
Although its pace slowed, space exploration continued after the end of the Space Race. The United States launched the first reusable spacecraft, the Space Shuttle, on the 20th anniversary of Gagarin's flight, April 12, 1981. On November 15, 1988, the Soviet Union duplicated this with an unmanned flight of [[Buran (spacecraft)|the only ''Buran''-class shuttle to fly]], its first and only reusable spacecraft. It was never used again after the first flight; instead the Soviet Union continued to develop space stations using the Soyuz craft as the crew shuttle.

Sally Ride became the first American woman in space in 1983. [[Eileen Collins]] was the first female Shuttle pilot, and with Shuttle mission [[STS-93]] in July 1999 she became the first woman to command a US spacecraft.

The [[United States]] continued missions to the ISS and other goals with the high-cost shuttle system, which was retired in 2011.

====Soyuz programme====
{{main|Soyuz programme}}
The Soyuz programme was initiated by the soviet space program in the 1960s and continues as the responsibility of [[roscosmos]] to this day. The program currently consists of 140 completed flights, and since the retirement of the US [[Space Shuttle]] has been the only craft to transport humans. The programs original goal was part of a program to put a cosmonaut on the moon, and later became crucial to the construction of the [[Mir]] space station.

====Mir====
[[File:Mir STS-89.jpg|thumb|Mir STS-89]]
{{main|Mir}}
Mir was a [[space station]] that operated in [[low Earth orbit]] from 1986 to 2001, operated by the [[Soviet Union]] and later by [[Russia]]. ''Mir'' was the first modular space station and was assembled in orbit from 1986&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;1996. The station served as a [[microgravity]] [[research]] [[laboratory]] in which crews conducted [[experiment]]s in [[biology]], [[human biology]], [[physics]], [[astronomy]], [[meteorology]] and spacecraft systems with a goal of developing technologies required for permanent occupation of [[Outer space|space]].&lt;ref&gt;David Harland (30 November 2004). ''The Story of Space Station Mir''. New York: Springer-Verlag New York Inc. {{ISBN|978-0-387-23011-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The record for longest human endurance on a single tour in space is held by [[Valeriy Polyakov]], who left Earth on January 8, 1994, and stayed aboard the ''Mir'' space station for a total of 437 days, 17 hours, 58 minutes, and 16 seconds, returning March 22, 1995. [[Sergei Krikalyov]] holds the current record for combined total time in space: 803 days, 9 hours, and 39 seconds. ''Mir'' was continuously occupied for 3,644 days, eight days short of 10 years, between the launch of [[Soyuz TM-8]] on September 5, 1989 and the landing of [[Soyuz TM-29]] on August 28, 1999. This record was held until surpassed by the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) in 2010. The ISS has been continuously occupied for {{age in days|2000|11|02}} days.

====Buran====

[[File:STS-135 final flyaround of ISS 1.jpg|thumb|180px|right|The ISS seen by [[Space Shuttle Atlantis]].]]
{{main|International Space Station}}
Recent space exploration has proceeded, to some extent in worldwide cooperation, the high point of which was the construction and operation of the International Space Station (ISS). At the same time, the international space race between smaller space powers since the end of the 20th century can be considered the foundation and expansion of markets of commercial rocket launches and [[space tourism]].

The United States continued other space exploration, including major participation with the ISS with its own modules. It also planned a set of unmanned Mars probes, military satellites, and more. The [[Constellation program|Constellation space program]], began by President [[George W. Bush]] in 2004, aimed to launch a next-generation multifunction [[Orion (Constellation program)|Orion]] spacecraft by 2018. A subsequent return to the Moon by 2020 was to be followed by manned flights to Mars, but the program was canceled in 2010 in favor of encouraging commercial US manned launch capabilities.

[[Russia]], a successor to the Soviet Union, has high potential but smaller funding. Its own space programs, some of a military nature, perform several functions. They offer a wide commercial launch service while continuing to support the ISS with several of their own modules. They also operate manned and cargo spacecraft which continued after the US Shuttle program ended.  They are developing a new multi-function [[Prospective Piloted Transport System|PPTS]] manned spacecraft for use in 2018 and have plans to perform manned moon missions as well. The program aims to put a man on the moon in the 2020s, becoming the second country to do so.

==={{flagicon|European Union}} [[European Space Agency]]===
{{main|ESA}}
The European Space Agency has taken the lead in commercial unmanned launches since the introduction of the [[Ariane 4]] in 1988 but is in competition with NASA, Russia,  [[Sea Launch]] (private), China, India, and others. The ESA-designed manned shuttle [[Hermes (shuttle)|Hermes]] and space station [[Columbus (spacecraft)|Columbus]] were under development in the late 1980s in Europe; however, these projects were canceled, and Europe did not become the third major "space power".

The European Space Agency has launched various satellites, has utilized the manned [[Spacelab]] module aboard US shuttles, and has sent probes to comets and Mars. It also participates in ISS with its own module and the unmanned cargo spacecraft [[Automated Transfer Vehicle|ATV]].

Currently ESA has a program for development of an independent multi-function manned spacecraft [[CSTS]] scheduled for completion in 2018. Further goals include an ambitious plan called the [[Aurora Programme]], which intends to send a human mission to Mars soon after 2030. A set of various landmark missions to reach this goal are currently under consideration.  The ESA has a multi-lateral partnership and plans for spacecraft and further missions with foreign participation and co-funding.
ESA is also developing [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo program]] which seeks to give independence to the EU from the American GPS.

==={{flagicon|PRC}} [[China]]===

{{Main|Shenzhou program}}

Since 1956 the Chinese have had a space program which was aided early on from 1957-1960 by the Soviets. They were provided missile technology experts and missiles to study from. In 1965 plans were made to launch a human into space by 1979, and in 1967 the plans were made for a 4-human spacecraft. "[[Dong Fang Hong I|East is Red]]" was launched on April 24, 1970 and was the first satellite to be launched by the Chinese. In 1974 the plan for human spaceflight was scrapped when policy makers decided that applications satellites were more important and competing with the USA and USSR wasn't as important. In late 1986, the 863 Project was started which had a focus on military applications, but also had a goal for human spaceflight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhongyang|first=Zheng|date=Spring 2018|title=The origins and development of China's manned spaceflight programme|url=https://www-sciencedirect-com.libproxy.mst.edu/science/article/pii/S0265964607000586|journal=Space Policy|volume=23|pages=167–171|via=ScienceDirect}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite possessing less funding than [[ESA]] or [[NASA]], the People's Republic of China has achieved manned space flight and operates a commercial satellite launch service. There are plans for a Chinese space station and a program to send unmanned probes to  [[Mars]].

China's first attempt at a manned spacecraft, [[Shuguang spacecraft|Shuguang]], was abandoned after years of development, but on October 15, 2003, China became the third nation to develop an indigenous human spaceflight capability when [[Yang Liwei]] entered orbit aboard [[Shenzhou 5]].

The US [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] released a report in 2006, detailing concerns about China's growing presence in space, including its capability for military action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.space.com/news/060605_china_military.html "Report: China's Military Space Power Growing"] by Leonard David, Space.com, June 5, 2006, Accessed June 8, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 China tested a ballistic missile designed to destroy satellites in orbit, which was followed by a US demonstration of a similar capability in 2008.

==={{flagicon|Japan}} [[Japan]]===
{{main|JAXA}}
Japan's space agency, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, is a major space player in Asia. While not maintaining a commercial launch service, Japan has deployed a module in the '''ISS''' and operates an unmanned cargo spacecraft, the [[H-II Transfer Vehicle]].

JAXA has plans to launch a Mars fly-by probe. Their lunar probe, [[SELENE]], is touted as the most sophisticated lunar exploration mission in the post-[[Apollo program|Apollo]] era. Japan's  [[Hayabusa]] probe was mankind's first sample return from an asteroid.  [[IKAROS]] was the first operational [[solar sail]].

Although Japan developed the [[HOPE-X]], [[Kankoh-maru]], and [[Fuji (Spacecraft)|Fuji]] manned capsule spacecraft, none of them have been launched.  Japan's current ambition is to deploy a new manned spacecraft by 2025 and to establish a  [[Moon base]] by 2030.

This article discusses the definitions and types of home [[medical equipment]] (HME), also known as [[durable medical equipment]] (DME), and durable medical equipment prosthetics and orthotics (DMEPOS).

== HME / DMEPOS ==

'''Home medical equipment''' is a category of [[medical devices|devices]] used for patients whose care is being managed from a home or other private facility managed by a nonprofessional caregiver or family member. It is often referred to as [[durable medical equipment|"durable" medical equipment]] (DME) as it is intended to withstand repeated use by non-professionals or the patient, and is appropriate for use in the home.

Medical supplies of an expendable nature, such as bandages, rubber gloves and irrigating kits are not considered by [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] to be DME.

Within the US medical and insurance industries, the following acronyms are used to describe home medical equipment:

* '''DME''': Durable Medical Equipment
* '''HME''': Home Medical Equipment
* '''DMEPOS''': Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics and Supplies

== Types of home medical equipment ==

== Obtaining and using home medical equipment ==
For most home medical equipment to be reimbursed by insurance, a patient must have a doctor's prescription for the equipment needed.  Some equipment, such as oxygen, is FDA regulated and must be prescribed by a physician before purchase whether insurance reimbursed or otherwise.

The physician may recommend a supplier for the home medical equipment, or the patient will have to research this on their own. HME / DMEPOS suppliers are located throughout the country and some specialty shops can also be found on the internet.

There is no established typical size for HME / DMEPOS suppliers. Supply companies include very large organizations such as Walgreens, Lincare, and Apria to smaller local companies operated by sole proprietors or families.  A new evolution in the home medical equipment arena is the advent of internet retailers who have lower operating costs so they often sell equipment for lower prices than local "brick and mortar", but lack the ability to offer in-home setup, equipment training and customer service.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} In all cases, however, there are strict rules and laws governing HME / DMEPOS suppliers that participate in Medicare and Medicaid programs.  In addition to rules outlined the National Supplier Clearinghouse, of division of CMS (centers for Medicare and Medicaid), all Medicare DME suppliers must obtain and maintain accreditation by one of many approved accrediting bodies.

Once a patient or caregiver selects an appropriate HME / DMEPOS supplier, he/she presents the supplier with the prescription and patient's insurance information. HME / DMEPOS suppliers maintain an inventory of products and equipment, so fulfillment of the prescription is rapid, much like a [[Pharmacy]].

The HME / DMEPOS supplier is obligated to perform certain functions when providing home medical equipment. These include:

* Proper delivery and setup of the equipment
* Ensuring the home environment is suitable and safe for proper usage of the equipment
* Training the patient, family and caregivers on the proper usage and maintenance of the equipment
* Informing the patient and/or caregiver of their rights and responsibilities

All HME / DMEPOS suppliers are required to comply with [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] (HIPAA) to protect patients' confidentiality and records.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

== Insurance ==

=== In the United States ===
Home medical equipment is typically covered by patient's healthcare insurance, including Medicare (Part B). In order to properly code home medical equipment for billing, the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System [[HCPCS]] is utilized.
As of 2014, under the [[Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act]] of 2003, providers of HME/DMEPOS will be required to become third-party accredited to standards regulated by the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS) in order to continue eligibility under Medicare Part B. This effort aims to standardize and improve the quality of service to patients provided by home medical equipment suppliers.

==Research and clinical trials==
Animal research has demonstrated that administration of HGF [[Complementary DNA|cDNA]] [[plasmids]] into ischemic cardiac tissue can increase cardiac function (improved left ventricular ejection fraction and fractional shortening compared to control subjects) after induced MI or ischemia.&lt;ref name=HahnPyun2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ShirakawaSawa2005 /&gt; Transfection with HGF plasmids in damaged cardiac tissue also promotes angiogenesis (increased capillary density compared to control subjects), as well as decreasing detrimental remodelling of the tissue at the site of injury (decreased fibrotic deposition).&lt;ref name=VogelTrap2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=HahnPyun2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=AzumaTaniyama2006/&gt; The increased production of HGF by transfected cardiomyocytes during injury has also shown to be a powerful chemo-attractant of adult mesenchymal stem cells via HGF/c-Met binding.&lt;ref name=VogelTrap2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ForteMinieri2006 /&gt; The [[mitogen|mitogenic]] and morphogenic properties of HGF induce recruited stem cells to take on cardiomyocyte phenotypes, potentially helping in the healing of ischemic tissue.&lt;ref name=ForteMinieri2006 /&gt;
The benefits of HGF in experimental models have led to its investigation in clinical trials. A [[Clinical trial|phase I clinical trial]] entailed injecting an [[adenovirus]] [[viral vector|vector]] with the human HGF (Ad-hHGF) gene into the coronary vessels localized to ischemic tissue. Results demonstrate that it is in fact safe to administer the Ad-hHGF vector into patients with coronary artery disease in hopes of re-vascularizing damaged tissue in patients for which [[coronary artery bypass surgery]] (CABG) or [[percutaneous coronary intervention]] (PCI) are not available or possible. Despite the trial’s limitations (''i.e.'' no assessment of left ventricular function and sample size was quite small), upon follow up assessments at 12 months, none of the patients receiving the treatment had been readmitted to hospital for MI, [[angina]] or aggravated heart failure.&lt;ref name=YangZhang2008 /&gt;

The '''[http://www.ismir.net International Society for Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR)]''' is an international forum for research on the organization of music-related data. It started as an informal group steered by an ''ad hoc'' committee in 2000&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ismir.net/texts/Byrd02.html Donald Byrd and Michael Fingerhut: ''The History of ISMIR - A Short Happy Tale''. D-Lib Magazine, Vol. 8 No. 11], {{ISSN|1082-9873}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which established a yearly symposium - whence "ISMIR", which meant '''International Symposium on Music Information Retrieval'''. It was turned into a conference in 2002 while retaining the acronym. ISMIR was incorporated in Canada on July 4, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ismir.net/ISMIR-Letters-Patent.pdf ISMIR Letters Patent. Canada, July 4, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
Given the tremendous growth of digital music and music metadata in recent years, methods for effectively extracting, searching, and organizing music information have received widespread interest from academia and the information and entertainment industries. The purpose of ISMIR is to provide a venue for the exchange of news, ideas, and results through the presentation of original theoretical or practical work. By bringing together researchers and developers, educators and librarians, students and professional users, all working in fields that contribute to this multidisciplinary domain, the conference also serves as a discussion forum, provides introductory and in-depth information on specific domains, and showcases current products.

As the term [[Music Information Retrieval|Music Information Retrieval (MIR)]]  indicates, this research is motivated by the desire to provide music lovers, music professionals and music industry with robust, effective and usable methods and tools to help them locate, retrieve and experience the music they wish to have access to. MIR is a truly interdisciplinary area, involving researchers from the disciplines of musicology, cognitive science, library and information science, computer science, electrical engineering and many others.

==Annual conferences==
Since its inception in 2000, ISMIR has been the world’s leading forum for research on the modelling, creation, searching, processing and use of musical data. Researchers across the globe meet at the annual conference conducted by the society. It is known by the same acronym as the society, ISMIR. Following is the list of previous conferences held by the society.

'''Kindle Banking Systems''' was a [[banking software|banking solutions]] company that originated from a bespoke banking systems project in 1979 for the Irish merchant bank [[Ansbacher Bank]].  Its main product was a modular banking system known as '''Bankmaster'''.  The system originally ran on the [[International Computers Limited|ICL]] hardware platform - the relationship with the UK-based computer manufacturer facilitated Kindle establishing a significant customer base in Asia and Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibsintelligence.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=14926:table-of-contents-retail-banking-systems-market-report-2009-2010-edition-6&amp;catid=65:publication-extract&amp;Itemid=2 |title=IBS Publications Retail Banking Systems Market Report, 2010 |publisher=IBS Intelligence |year=2010}} {{dead link|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kindle is regarded as a company of note, as it was the first high-tech Irish company which achieved the status of world leader in its field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://docs.google.com/fileview?id=0B9b4rVKQOryENGM1ZWIyZTYtMWFjZS00NTJkLTk4YTYtYjEzY2E3NzhkZTUx&amp;hl=en |title=Impact of the Internet on Selected Relationships Between International Banking Systems Solution Providers and Retail Financial Institutions, 1996-2001 |author=Stephen Walsh |date=April 3, 2002 |publisher=University of Limerick }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}
Kindle's main product Bankmaster, was a modular System25 Assembler-based banking system and started development in 1979 as a bespoke banking systems project in the Irish merchant bank [[Ansbacher Bank]].

The Company was originally called MA Systems, then Triple A Systems before finally settling on Kindle Banking Systems. The driving force behind the design and development of Bankmaster was Cian Kinsella. Led by MD and founder Tony Kilduff, the company had an impressive sales record developing many lasting customer relationships in the UK, Africa, India, Asia and Latin America.

By 1987, according to the RBS Market Report, there were 170 sites operating Bankmaster worldwide. [[Standard Chartered Bank]] was the largest user of Bankmaster - the company formed a spin-off joint venture with Kindle specifically to support its own deployments. [[State Bank of India]] deployed the branch platform, Branchpower to 2000 branches throughout India.  The system allowed branches to operate in an off-line mode - this made it popular with retail banks in countries where the communications infrastructure was poor.  The Bank of England and eight other [[central banks]] (mainly in Africa) used the treasury modules of Bankmaster.

In 1991, Kindle was acquired by a rival company; ACT, and was renamed as ACT Kindle.  ACT was subsequently acquired by [[Misys]] in 1995 - the Kindle brand was retained until 2001 at which point it was subsumed into the Misys branding.  During the later part of the 1990s sales of Bankmaster declined - whilst the Bankmaster solution set was considered to be functionally rich, the core technology had been allowed to become obsolete.

Between 1994 and 2000 the company made a significant investment in developing a new generation retail banking system, called Bankmaster-RS. It was developed in cooperation with the Colombian bank Coomeva. Bankmaster-RS struggled to deliver the planned functionality and was never as widely adopted as its predecessor.

Founded in 2001, LIXI has developed and released standards for such transactions as mortgage applications, property valuations, broker commissions and several others.

With the purpose being the exchange of transaction data in the lending chain, the initial LIXI efforts focused on the creation and promulgation of data standards based on [[XML]]. This effort had the intended result, with the organisation winning an Innovation Award from MIS magazine in 2005. LIXI also collaborates with the Australian research institution [[NICTA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.computerworld.com.au/article/176657/e-commerce_standards_lending_industry/|title=E-commerce standards for lending industry - Computerworld|work=computerworld.com.au|accessdate=8 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effort is in two primary areas, one is the creation of reference implementations of the data standards and the second is in the area of mapping data standards on to business processes.

== Members ==
Members of LIXI include all the major and mid-tier banks in Australia, as well as the mortgage insurers, valuation panel managers and large valuations firms, the major software providers to the lending industry, and a number of legal, conveyancing and outsource service providers:

The '''lactoscope''' is an instrument for estimating the amount of cream in milk, based on its relative opacity. The higher the opacity, the greater the amount of cream present. Credit for the development of this instrument is given to [[Alfred François Donné|Alfred Donn&amp;eacute;]] in 1843.&lt;ref name=jrase16_584/&gt;&lt;ref name=jce80_7_762/&gt; The instrument was also used to measure the fat content of milk, but it gave inaccurate results.&lt;ref name=Pearson/&gt;

The following list outlines a number of [[Electromagnetic compatibility|EMC]] standards which are known at the time of writing to be either available or have been made available for public comment.  These standards attempt to standardize product EMC performance, with respect to conducted or radiated [[radio interference]] from [[Electrical power|electrical]] or [[Electronics|electronic]] equipment, imposition of other types of disturbance on the mains supply by such equipment, and the sensitivity of such equipment to received interference. 

The legal status of these standards varies according to the jurisdiction. Standards called up by the European Union's EMC Directive effectively have the force of law in the EU. 

==[[CISPR]] standards==
CISPR standards cover product emission and immunity requirements as well as defining test methods and equipment.

CISPR is the acronym of '''C'''omité '''I'''nternational '''S'''pécial des '''P'''erturbations '''R'''adio,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://courses.ee.sun.ac.za/Sertifisering_442/IEC%20and%20CISPR%20standards.pdf|title = IEC and CISPR Standards|date = 2 May 2007|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Gideon Wiid, PhD student|first = Paul van der Merwe EE Eng}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the International Special Committee for Radio Protection.
* [[CISPR 11]], Industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) radio-frequency equipment - Electromagnetic disturbance characteristics - Limits and methods of measurement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3275">'''Lyric Hearing''' is an [[extended wear hearing aid]] developed by [[InSound Medical]], founded by medical device inventor entrepreneur [[Adnan Shennib]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20120211173440/http://www.hearingreview.com/issues/articles/2003-01_09.asp] and Thar Casey. The device rests inside the [[ear canal]] and uses the ears anatomy to funnel sound to the ear drum.&lt;ref&gt;Tara Parker-Pope [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/15/health/15well.html Raves (Yes, It’s True) for New Hearing Aid] ''New York Times'' April 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The device is placed into the ear canal by a certified professional and no [[surgery]] or [[anesthesia]] is required when inserting the device. Although individual replacement needs can vary, Lyric is designed to be worn for up to 4 months at a time without needing to remove it or replace batteries.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Connor [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/tiny-device-that-heralds-the-end-of-unsightly-hearing-aids-810382.html Tiny device that heralds the end of unsightly hearing aids] ''The Independent'' 17 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The design and placement of the Lyric Hearing device reduces background noise and feedback for natural sound quality. Wearers of the device can use it while talking on the phone, exercising, or sleeping and do not need to fear the device falling out. Lyric Hearing is also water resistant, so wearers can shower with the device or do other water surface based activities, although the company does not recommend swimming or diving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Palmer CV |title=A contemporary review of hearing aids |journal=Laryngoscope |volume=119 |issue=11 |pages=2195–204 |date=November 2009 |pmid=19824045 |doi=10.1002/lary.20690 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lyric Hearing device is not a [[Cochlear Implant]]. The device is removed every few months and is replaced with a new one. Wearers can adjust the volume of the device using a magnet and a removal tool is also provided. ''Business Week'' reports that this hearing aid received a 2009 Medical Design Excellence Award.&lt;ref&gt;Damian Joseph [http://images.businessweek.com/ss/09/04/0427_mdea_awards/21.htm Medical Devices That Might Save Your Life: Lyric Hearing Aid] ''Bloomberg Businessweek'' 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Lyric was sold in 2010 to Sonova, the parent company of Phonak, a hearing aid (daily wear) manufacturer. Phonak launched a new version of the Lyric (Lyric 2) in 2012 that is smaller in order to fit more ear canals.

The addition of high MOSFET Gate drivers are the last step if the turn-on is to fully enhance the conducting channel of the [[MOSFET]] technology.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Laszlo|first=Balogh|title=Design And Application Guide For High Speed MOSFET Gate Drive Circuits|url=http://www.ti.com/lit/ml/slup169/slup169.pdf|work=www.ti.com|accessdate=November 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==MOSFET Technology==
The Gate Driver works under the same principle as the MOSFET transistor. It provides an output current that provides a charge to the semiconductor by a control electrode. It is also simple to drive and has resistive nature for power uses.

The '''Manufacturing Technologies Association''' ('''MTA''') is a UK [[trade association]] representing the [[manufacturing technologies]] industry. The MTA sits at the core of the [[engineering]] based manufacturing sector and as an association works tirelessly to ensure member companies are as commercially successful as possible.

The association's key activities include:
- Representing engineering based manufacturing and supporting the advanced engineering sector through lobbying, media contact and networking.
- Providing relevant and specific industry intelligence 
- Encouraging talent through funding and support for workplace training and education initiatives in schools, colleges and universities.
- Delivering the UK's only major exhibition focused on manufacturing technologies – MACH (owned and organised by the MTA)

Membership of the MTA is open to companies involved with the manufacturing technologies sector and end users of such technology. 

==Function==
The MTA represents UK companies, their associates and affiliates who drive UK [[manufacturing]] technology, innovation and quality.

The website contains a member &amp; product directory by geographic position. It also provides information and statistics on the economic health of the British manufacturing markets.

MTA is the owner and organiser of the UK's premier manufacturing event - the MACH exhibition, a week-long event held biennially in April at the [[National Exhibition Centre|NEC]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.machexhibition.com MACH Exhibition]&lt;/ref&gt;

The types of manufacturing technologies covered by the organisation, and the exhibition, include:
* Metalcutting
* Metalforming
* Automation and robotics
* CAD/CAM
* Engineering lasers
* Measurement and inspection
* Tooling and workholding
* Welding and metal fabrication
* Rapid manufacturing and rapid prototyping

==History==
The original [[Machine tool|Machine Tool]]s Trades Association (MTTA) was formed in 1919, becoming the Machine Tools Technologies Association. Since its formation the association has evolved into a trade body with a global support network, promoting internationally competitive trade in manufacturing technologies.

==Structure==
The MTA is based in [[London]], with close contact with the [[British Government]] through the [[Department of Business Innovation and Skills (BIS) (United Kingdom)]], [[Confederation of British Industry|CBI]] and [[UK Trade &amp; Investment]]. 

The association's offices are located on ''Bayswater Road'' (A402) next to [[Lancaster Gate tube station]].

The association also provides a secretariat service to the [[Federation of British Hand Tool Manufacturers]] (FBHTM), and the MTA Tooling Group, formerly the [[British Hard Metal and Engineers' Cutting Tools Association]] (BHECTA).

[[File:Mascara de pestañas.jpg|thumb|A mascara tube and a wand applicator]]

'''Mascara''' is a [[Cosmetics|cosmetic]] commonly used to enhance the [[eyelashes]]. It may darken, thicken, lengthen, and/or define the eyelashes. Normally in one of three forms—liquid, cake, or cream—the modern mascara product has various formulas; however, most contain the same basic components of pigments, oils, waxes, and preservatives.

== Definition ==

The ''[[Collins English Dictionary]]'' defines ''mascara'' as, "a cosmetic substance for darkening, lengthening, curling, coloring, and thickening the [[eyelashes]], applied with a brush or rod." The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (''OED'') adds that mascara is occasionally used on the eyebrows as well.

The ''OED'' also references ''mascaro'' from works published in the late 15th century. In 1886, the ''Peck &amp; Snyder Catalogue'' advertises, “Mascaro or Water Cosmetique… For darkening the eyebrow and moustaches without greasing them and making them prominent.” In 1890, the ''Century Dictionary'' defined mascara as “a kind of paint used for the eyebrows and eyelashes by actors.” And in 1894, N. Lynn advises in ''Lynn’s Practical Hints for Making-up'', “to darken eyelashes, paint with mascara, or black paint, with a small brush.

== Etymology ==
The source of the word “mascara” is unclear.  The Spanish word ''máscara'' meaning ‘mask’ or ‘stain’, and the Italian word ''maschera'' meaning ‘mask’ are possible origins.&lt;ref name=Harper2010&gt;{{cite book | publisher = Harper, Douglas | title = Mascara | work = Online Etymology Dictionary | date = 2010 | access-date=13 Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A related Catalan word describes soot or a black smear, and the Portuguese word ''máscara'' means ‘mask’ and ''mascarra'' means dark stain or smut).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary|quote=Probably &lt; Spanish ''máscara'' or Italian ''maschera'', Italian regional ''mascara'', all in sense ‘mask’; or perhaps alternatively &lt; Catalan ''mascara'' ‘soot, black smear’, or Portuguese ''mascarra'' ‘stain, smut’.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is even strong support for a possible source from the Arabic word ''maskharah'' or ‘buffoon’.&lt;ref name=mascara2005&gt;{{Cite book | title = The Macquarie Dictionary | location = South Yarra | publisher = The Macquarie Library Pty Ltd. | date = 2005 | access-date = 15 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[New Oxford American Dictionary]]|edition=2|quote=late 19th cent.: from Italian, literally ‘mask’, from Arabic masḵara ‘buffoon’.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hebrew word משקרות (MaSQROTh) as relating to women's eyes is found in Isaiah 3:16.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Clarke, Commentary, 1831, volume III page 688&lt;/ref&gt;

Latin treatises sometimes used the word mascara when referring to witches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Barbra G. Walker | title = The Woman's Encyclopedia of Myths and Secrets | date = 1996 | page = 1077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

[[File:Eye make-up.jpg|thumb|right|Mascara being applied.]]

Aesthetic adornment is a [[cultural universal]] and mascara can be documented in [[ancient Egypt]]. Records from around 4000 BC refer to a substance called [[Kohl (cosmetics)|kohl]] that was used to darken eyelashes, eyelids, and eyebrows.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{citation | title = Mascara | work = How Products Are Made | publisher = Advameg, Inc. | date = 28 Nov 2007 | access-date = 16 Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kohl was used to mask the eyes, believed to ward off evil spirits and protect the soul, by both men and women. Often composed of [[galena]]; [[malachite]]; and charcoal or soot, crocodile stool; honey; and water was added to keep the kohl from running.&lt;ref name=ReferenceB&gt;{{citation | author = Michalak, Jodie | title= History of Mascara | work = Love To Know | date = 7 Jul 2010 | access-date = 22 Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through Egypt’s influence, kohl usage persisted in the subsequent Babylonian, Greek and Roman empires. Following the fall of the Roman Empire, kohl fell into disuse on the European continent, where it had been considered solely a cosmetic; conversely, it continued to be widely used in the Middle East for religious purposes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
 
Makeup was considered unsightly and uncouth in Western culture until the Victorian era. During the Victorian era, social opinion shifted radically towards the promotion of cosmetics, and women were known to spend a majority of their day occupied with beauty regimens. Great efforts were made to create the illusion of long, dark eyelashes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idWong2010|Wong, Michael. “Fascinating History of Mascara.”]]&lt;/ref&gt; Attempting this, Victorian women made a type of mascara in their own homes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; They would heat a mixture of ash or lampblack and elderberry juice on a plate and apply the heated mixture to their eyelashes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Flemming, Katherine|title=Technology: The History of Mascara|work=FASHION Magazine|publisher=St. Joseph Media|date=August 2006|access-date=18 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The product that people would recognize as mascara today did not develop until the 19th century. A chemist named [[Eugène Rimmel]] developed a cosmetic using the newly invented [[petroleum jelly]]. The name Rimmel became synonymous with the substance and still translates to “mascara” in the Portuguese, Spanish, Greek, Turkish, Romanian, and Persian languages today.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{Citation|author=Parwani, Kritika|title=Mascara Ingredients|work=Buzzle|date=2010|access-date=18 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Across the Atlantic Ocean and at roughly the same time, in 1915, [[Thomas Lyle Williams]] created a remarkably similar substance for his sister Maybel.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; In 1917 he started a mail-order business from the product that grew to become the company [[Maybelline]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The mascara developed by these two men consisted of petroleum jelly and coal in a set ratio.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; It was undeniably messy, and a better alternative was soon developed. A dampened brush was rubbed against a cake containing soap and black dye in equal proportions and applied to the lashes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Still it was extremely messy. No significant improvement occurred until 1957 with an innovation by [[Helena Rubinstein]].

The events leading to Rubinstein’s improvement began in Paris in the early 20th century. There, at the fashion capital of the world, mascara was quickly gaining popularity and common usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| chapter = Arden, Elizabeth, Dec. 31, 1878?-Oct. 18, 1966 | title = Notable American Women: The Modern Period | location = Cambridge | publisher = Harvard University Press | date = 1980 | access-date = 15 Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elizabeth Arden]] and Helena Rubinstein, two giants in the American beauty industry, watched and kept abreast of its development. After the [[First World War]], American consumers became eager for new products.&lt;ref name="RUBINSTEIN, Helena 1965"&gt;{{cite book |chapter = Rubinstein, Helena, Dec. 25, 1870-April 1, 1965 | title = Notable American Women: The Modern Period | location = Cambridge | publisher = Harvard University Press | date = 1980 | access-date = 15 Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sensing an opportunity, both Rubinstein and Arden launched their own brands of cosmetics that included mascara. Through the efforts of these two rivals and public temperament, mascara finally gained respectability and favor in American society.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title = Arden, Elizabeth, née Florence Nightingale Graham | work = Chambers Biographical Dictionary | location = London | publisher = Chambers Harrap | date= 2007 | access-date = 15 Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The invention of the photograph and motion picture launched mascara’s popularity and usage further forward in America. Motion pictures especially advertised a new standard of beauty and sex appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author =Purifoy, Jennifer | chapter = Understanding the History of Cosmetics | title = History of 20th Century Fashion | access-date = 29 Oct 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Famous actresses of the classic cinema era, such as [[Theda Bara]], [[Pola Negri]], [[Clara Bow]], [[Greta Garbo]], [[Marlene Dietrich]], [[Bette Davis]], and [[Jean Harlow]], depended heavily upon mascara for their glamorized appearances, which the average woman sought to mimic.&lt;ref name=Riordan&gt;{{Cite book |author = Riordan, Teresa | title = Inventing Beauty: A History of Innovations that Have Made Us Beautiful}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8–9,11–12}}

In 1933, a woman known on court records as Mrs. Brown consented to have her eyelashes permanently dyed.&lt;ref name=Riordan/&gt;{{rp|20}} Unfortunately, the product, Lash Lure, used [[P-Phenylenediamine|''para''-phenylenediamine]], a chemical extremely toxic to the body, as the dyeing agent.&lt;ref name=Riordan/&gt;{{rp|23}} At the time, cosmetics were unregulated by the Federal Drug Administration, and the dangers of paraphenylenediamine were unknown.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idNational2004|National Research Council. "Safety Testing."]] p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Within hours of the treatment, Mrs. Brown began experiencing severe symptoms of stinging and burning eyes. By the next morning, Mrs. Brown’s eyes had developed ulcers which oozed and had swollen shut.&lt;ref name=Riordan/&gt;{{rp|22}} Use of Lash Lure resulted in blindness in Mrs. Brown and fifteen other women and also caused the death of another. It was only after the Lash Lure incident and several others like it, documented in [[Ruth deForest Lamb]]’s book entitled ''American Chamber of Horrors'', that Congress granted the FDA the right to regulate cosmetics in 1938.&lt;ref name=Riordan/&gt;{{rp|24}}

Years later in 1957, Rubinstein created a formula that evolved mascara from a hard cake into a lotion-based cream. She packaged the new mascara in a tube to be sold with a brush. For use, the cream was squeezed onto the brush and applied to lashes.&lt;ref name="RUBINSTEIN, Helena 1965"/&gt; Although still messy, it was a step towards the modern mascara product.

Soon, a grooved rod was patented. This device picked up the same amount of mascara for each use. Then the grooved rod was altered to the brush similar to the ones used today. The change in applicator led mascara to be even easier to use, and its popularity increased.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Mascara is now trending towards multi-functional usage, with many mascaras including lash-boosting serums, botanicals, and pro-vitamin-enriched formulas. Korean technology is at the forefront of the development, and a number of brands use tubing formulas to coat the lash.  

===Ingredients and manufacture===
All formulations contain [[pigment]]s, oils, and waxes.

=== Cosmetic pigments ===
The pigmentation for black mascara is similar to that used by the Egyptians and Victorian women. Black and brown mascaras typically are colored by use of iron oxides.&lt;ref&gt;Günther Schneider, Sven Gohla, Jörg Schreiber, Waltraud Kaden, Uwe Schönrock, Hartmut Schmidt-Lewerkühne, Annegret Kuschel, Xenia Petsitis, Wolfgang Pape, water "Skin Cosmetics" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a24_219}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some mascaras contain [[ultramarine blue]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Mascara is composed of a base mixture of pigments, waxes, and oils with varying supporting components. Mascara pigments most commonly include [[Iron oxide|iron oxides]] and [[titanium dioxide]] which provide mascara with its desired color.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/0471238961.0914151814152215.a01.pub2/abstract|title=Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology|last=Swiler|first=Daniel R.|date=2005|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|year=|isbn=9780471238966|location=|pages=|language=en|chapter=Pigments, Inorganic|doi=10.1002/0471238961.0914151814152215.a01.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Titanium dioxide (TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) accounts for over 65% of inorganic pigments sales volume.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/0471238961.0914151805070518.a01.pub3/abstract|title=Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology|last=Jones|first=Tony|last2=Egerton|first2=Terry A.|date=2000|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|year=|isbn=9780471238966|location=|pages=|language=en|chapter=Titanium Compounds, Inorganic|doi=10.1002/0471238961.0914151805070518.a01.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt; TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gives the pigment a white color while different iron oxides provide a variety of colors such as red, yellow, brown, and black.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The particle size of opaque pigments ranges from 0.2-0.3 µm.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Oils, waxes, etc.===
Among the many oils used, [[linseed]] oil, [[castor oil]], [[eucalyptus]] oil, [[lanolin]], and oil of [[turpentine]] are found frequently. [[Sesame]] oil is also commonly used.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  Waxes usually found in mascara are [[paraffin wax]], [[carnauba wax]], and [[beeswax]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Some mascaras are created with the use of fish scales.&lt;ref&gt;www.oddee.com/item_98322.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

The desired effects of the mascara account for most variations of ingredients.  Water-resistant mascaras require hydrophobic ingredients, like [[dodecane]]. Non water-resistant mascaras have base ingredients that are water-soluble.&lt;ref name="toxic"&gt;{{citation | title=Does Your Mascara Contain Toxic Ingredients? | publisher = Health Central | date = 4 Mar 2010 | access-date = 18 Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mascaras designed to lengthen or curl the eyelashes often contain [[nylon]] or [[rayon]] microfibers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Who Wins the Mascara War? | publisher = Carefair | date = 2009 | access-date = 27 Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[ceresin]], [[gum tragacanth]], and [[methyl cellulose]] are regular ingredients and serve as stiffeners.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=== Manufacture===
Mascara is often used on a daily basis around the world. In 2016 alone, U.S. consumers spent 335.6 million USD on the top 10 leading mascara brands.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.statista.com/statistics/497657/mascara-brands-sales-in-the-us/|title=Leading mascara brands in the U.S. dollar sales, 2016 {{!}} Statistic|last=Drug Store News|first=|date=August 9, 2016|website=Statista|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one method of production, referred to as [[anhydrous]], all waxes, oils, and pigments are mixed, heated, and agitated simultaneously. The alternative method, termed [[emulsion]], starts by combining water and thickeners. Separately, waxes and emulsifiers are combined. Pigment is then added individually to both mixtures. Finally all is combined in a [[homogenizer]], which acts as a high-speed agitator in order to thoroughly mix the oils, water, waxes, and emulsifiers—ingredients that naturally repulse each other.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Mascara has a shelf life of two to four months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/Labeling/ExpirationDating/default.htm|title=Shelf Life/Expiration Dating|last=|first=|date=November 5, 2017|website=US Food and Drug Administration|language=en|publication-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Safety ==

[[File:Eyelashes &amp; Mascara.jpg|thumb|right|Mascara coated eyelashes.]]
===United States===
Mercury compounds can be used as a preservative in eye make-up and so are occasionally found in mascara .&lt;ref name="safety"&gt;{{cite book | chapter = Cosmetic Safety | title = The New Harvard Guide to Women's Health | location = Cambridge | publisher = Harvard University Press | date = 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is more common to develop a [[stye]], or commoner still, swollen eyelids.&lt;ref name="toxic"/&gt; Styes and swollen eyelids are better classified as allergic reactions. The allergic reactions can be stimulated by any of the components of mascara but is usually attributed to [[methylparaben]], [[aluminum]] powder, [[ceteareth]]-20, [[butylparaben]], or [[benzyl alcohol]].&lt;ref name="toxic" /&gt;

== Psychology ==

The use of mascara may help to mimic [[neoteny]], a youthful or childlike appearance which is believed to be correlated to beauty in women. In various cultures, the typical characteristics of children—soft cheeks, a round face, soft skin, large eyes, upturned nose, and a short chin—are often seen as ideal facial characteristics for women. Mascara pulls away the eyelash from the rim of the eye creating a doe-like illusion of larger, more open eyes. Wide eyes may be associated to youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter = Beauty Politics and Patriarchy: The Impact on Women's Lives | title = Encyclopedia of Women and Gender: Sex Similarities and Differences and the Impact of Society on Gender | location = Oxford | publisher = Elsevier Science &amp; Technology | date = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Micromotors''' are very small particles (measured in [[microns]]) that can move themselves.  The term is often used interchangeably with "[[nanomotor]]," despite the implicit size difference.  These micromotors actually propel themselves in a specific direction autonomously when placed in a chemical solution.  There are many different micromotor types operating under a host of mechanisms.  Easily the most important examples are biological motors such as bacteria and any other self-propelled cells.  Synthetically, researchers have exploited [[Oxidation-reduction reaction|oxidation-reduction]] reactions to produce chemical gradients, local fluid flows, or streams of bubbles that then propel these micromotors through chemical media. 

Micromotors may have applications in medicine since they have been shown to be able to deliver materials to living cells within an organism. They also have been shown to be effective in degrading certain chemical and biological warfare agents.

== Janus Motor Propulsion ==
Janus sphere micromotors usually consist of a titanium dioxide surface layer and a strong [[reducing agent]] inner layer. The interaction of the two layer under irradiation of UV light produces bubbles as a result of a [[Reduction (chemistry)|reduction]] reaction. Micromotors usually have a size of about 30μm with a small 2μm opening on the outer layer. This leads to the exposure of the inner core, which is typically the fuel source for the propulsion mechanism. The diameter of the hole controls the rate and speed of the reaction.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=Jinxing|last2=Singh|first2=Virendra V.|last3=Sattayasamitsathit|first3=Sirilak|last4=Orozco|first4=Jahir|last5=Kaufmann|first5=Kevin|last6=Dong|first6=Renfeng|last7=Gao|first7=Wei|last8=Jurado-Sanchez|first8=Beatriz|last9=Fedorak|first9=Yuri|last10=Wang|first10=Joseph|title=Water-Driven Micromotors for Rapid Photocatalytic Degradation of Biological and Chemical Warfare Agents|journal=ACS Nano|date=25 November 2014|volume=8|issue=11|pages=11118–11125|doi=10.1021/nn505029k}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nano particle Implementation ===
[[Nanoparticle|Nano particle]] incorporation into micromotors has been recently studied and observed further. Specifically, gold nanoparticles have been introduced to the traditional titanium dioxide outer layer of most micromotors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The size of these gold nanoparticles typically is distributed from anywhere around 3&amp;nbsp;nm to 30&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Su|first1=Ren|last2=Tiruvalam|first2=Ramchandra|last3=He|first3=Qian|last4=Dimitratos|first4=Nikolaos|last5=Kesavan|first5=Lokesh|last6=Hammond|first6=Ceri|last7=Lopez-Sanchez|first7=Jose Antonio|last8=Bechstein|first8=Ralf|last9=Kiely|first9=Christopher J.|last10=Hutchings|first10=Graham J.|last11=Besenbacher|first11=Flemming|title=Promotion of Phenol Photodecomposition over TiO                            Using Au, Pd, and Au–Pd Nanoparticles|journal=ACS Nano|date=24 July 2012|volume=6|issue=7|pages=6284–6292|doi=10.1021/nn301718v}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since these gold nanoparticles are layered on top of the inner core (usually a reducing agent, such as magnesium), there is enhanced macrogalvanic corrosion observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gao|first1=Wei|last2=Feng|first2=Xiaomiao|last3=Pei|first3=Allen|last4=Gu|first4=Yonge|last5=Li|first5=Jinxing|last6=Wang|first6=Joseph|title=Seawater-driven magnesium based Janus micromotors for environmental remediation|journal=Nanoscale|date=2013|volume=5|issue=11|pages=4696|doi=10.1039/c3nr01458d|bibcode=2013Nanos...5.4696G}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technically, this is where the [[cathode]] and [[anode]] are in contact with each other, creating a circuit. The cathode, as a result of the circuit, is corroded. The depletion of this inner core leads to the reduction of the chemical environment as a fuel source. For example, in a TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Au/Mg micromotor in a seawater environment, the magnesium inner core would experience corrosion and reduce water to begin a chain of reactions that results in hydrogen gas as a fuel source. The reduction reaction is as follows: &lt;math&gt;Mg + 2H_2O \to Mg(OH)_2 + H_2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==Applications==
Researchers hope that micromotors will be used in medicine to deliver medication and do other precise small-scale interventions. A study has shown that micromotors could deliver gold particles to the stomach layer of living mice.&lt;ref name=mice&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bourzac|first1=Katherine|title=Micromotors Take Their First Swim In The Body|url=http://cen.acs.org/articles/93/web/2015/01/Micromotors-Take-First-Swim-Body.html|website=C&amp;EN|publisher=Chemical and Engineering News|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Photocatalytic Degradation of Biological and Chemical Warfare Agents ==
Micromotors are capable of [[photocatalysis|photocatalytic]] degradation with the appropriate composition. Specifically, micromotors with a titanium dioxide/gold nanoparticle outer layer and magnesium inner core are currently being examined and studied for their degradation efficacy against [[chemical warfare|chemical]] and [[biological warfare]] agents (CBWA). These new TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Au/Mg micromotors produce no [[reagent]]s or toxic byproducts from the propulsion and degradation mechanisms. However, they are very effective against CBWAs and present a complete and rapid degradation of certain CBWAs. There has been recent research of TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Au/Mg micromotors and their use and degradation efficacy against biological warfare agents, such as Bacillus anthracis, and chemical warfare agents, such as organaphosphate [[nerve agent]]s- a class of [[acetylcholinesterase]] [[Enzyme inhibitor|inhibitors]]. Therefore, application of these micromotors is a possibility for defense and environmental applications.

=== Photocatalytic Degradation Mechanism ===
These new micromotors are composed of a photoactive titanium dioxide outer/surface layer that has gold nanoparticles as well. Under UV irradiation, the adsorbed water produces strongly oxidizing hydroxyl radicals. Also, adsorbed molecular O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reacts with electrons producing superoxide anions. Those superoxide anions also produce to the production of peroxide radicals, hydroxyl radicals, and hydroxyl anions. Transformation into carbon dioxide and water, otherwise known as [[:wikt:mineralization|mineralization]], of CWAs has been observed as a result of the radicals and [[anions]]. Also, the gold nanoparticles effectively shift the [[Fermi level]] of titanium dioxide, enhancing the distribution of the electron charge. Therefore, the lifetime of the radicals and anions is extended, so the implementation of gold nanoparticles has greatly improved photocatalytic efficiency.

'''The Multiverse Network, Inc.''' was an [[United States|American]] [[startup company]] creating a network and platform for [[MMOG|Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs)]] and 3D [[virtual world]]s. Multiverse's stated aim was to lower the barrier of entry for development teams by providing a low-cost software platform for online game and virtual world development.

In 2009, the company extended its development platform to support Flash&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Multiverse Unleashes New Era of Online Gaming|url=http://multiverse.net/press/pr20090205.jsp?cid=6&amp;scid=9|accessdate=21 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and built a series of real-time multiplayer games to demo the technology. As part of the worldwide marketing effort behind James Cameron's AVATAR film, Multiverse built two Flash-based games,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Multiverse's Remix Makes it Easy to Create AVATAR Spinoff Games|url=https://venturebeat.com/2009/12/17/multiverses-remix-makes-it-easy-to-create-avatar-spinoff-games/|accessdate=21 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; one with McDonald's and another with Coca-Cola Zero. Both games allow players to explore Pandora, where much of the film takes place.

In late 2011, Multiverse closed from lack of profits, releasing the source code to The Multiverse Foundation, a non-profit group of volunteers who are presently updating the Platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cash-strapped Firefly MMO developer Multiverse closes (January 4, 2012)|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/39463/Cashstrapped_Firefly_MMO_developer_Multiverse_closes.php|accessdate=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==

Multiverse provided technology known as [[Game engine#MMOG Middleware|MMOG middleware]] (Multiverse used the term [[Platform (computing)|platform]]). It included the client software [[Multiverse World Browser]] (for [[Microsoft Windows]] only), a server suite, development tools, sample assets, documentation, and a developer community.  The goal was to provide consumers/users with a single client program that let them visit all of the virtual worlds built on the Multiverse Platform.  From the consumer point of view, this enabled a de facto network of virtual worlds.

Like [[RealmForge]], the Multiverse World Browser was written in C#, and based on the [[Axiom Engine]].  The Multiverse server suite was written in [[Java (Sun)|Java]] and used a [[publish/subscribe]] messaging system to provide reliability and scalability.  The server also provided a plug-in API.  The Windows-based tools used the [[COLLADA]] data interchange format, to enable artists to import 3D assets from popular tools such as [[Maya (software)|Maya]], [[3ds Max|3D Studio Max]], and Google [[SketchUp]].

==Business model==

Multiverse provided its technology platform cost-free for development and deployment.  Income came through revenue-sharing; Multiverse took a share of any payments made by consumers/users to the world developer.  If a developer provided a world for free (or free for a period of time), Multiverse did not charge anything.  When a developer started charging consumers/users, Multiverse took a share (10 percent), and also handled the financial transaction processing. Development teams hosted their own servers and retained 100 percent of their world's IP.

[[James Cameron]] joined the company's board of advisors, and [[Red Herring magazine]] selected it as one of the "Red Herring 100" privately held companies that play a leading role in innovating the technology business.

In December, 2006, Multiverse announced that it had optioned the rights to develop an MMOG based on ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'', the science fiction television series [http://www.multiverse.net/press/pr20061207.jsp?cid=6&amp;scid=9]. In 2008, a [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy]] and [[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]] MMO were announced [http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/technology/news/e3i0532517b5fc5d6af005a0ac8006987cf]. None of them ever came to fruition.

==Open Source==

After closing shop, the Multiverse Network released its code as open source under the [[MIT License]].  It is now managed by the [[Multiverse Foundation]] [http://multiversemmo.com/], a worldwide non-profit organization.

The '''Network Centric Operations Industry Consortium''' (NCOIC) is an international not-for-profit, chartered in the United States, whose goal is to facilitate the adoption of [[cross-domain interoperability]] standards.&lt;ref&gt;Kenyon, H. [http://washingtontechnology.com/articles/2010/09/30/interoperability-efforts-bear-fruit.aspx "NCOIC's efforts toward product interoperability are showing promise"], ''Washington Technology'', 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  Formed in September 2004, the organization is composed of more than 50 members and advisors representing business,  government organizations and academic institutions in 12 countries.&lt;ref&gt;ASDNews, [http://www.asdnews.com/news-1619/Network_Centric_Operations_Industry_Consortium_-NCOIC-_Launch.htm "Network Centric Operations Industry Consortium -NCOIC- Launch"], ''Aerospace &amp; Defense News'', 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

NCO is the application of the fundamental tenets of network-centric warfare to aspects of national security, especially industry support for the missions of both the [[United States Department of Defense]] and the [[Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS). NCOIC does not only subscribe to the military use of this theory, but also works to apply NCO and interoperability across nations and industries, including emergency response, health care, [[aerospace]], [[information technology]] cyber security &amp; [[cloud computing]], energy and financial services.

NCOIC’s technical teams have developed resources to further the use of network-centric systems and interoperability in both the public and private sectors. These resources – including processes, tools, frameworks, patterns, principles and databases—are available free of charge on the NCOIC website. They are aimed at helping an organization lower engineering costs, speed program implementation, increase capability and reduce risk. The consortium also provides training and services such as interoperability demonstrations, acquisition strategies, evaluations and verification.

NCOIC focuses on four interdependent areas in identifying solutions that will enable cross-domain interoperability: business, culture, governance and technical. The interaction, influence and impact of factors—such as financial objectives, business goals, laws and regulations, and cultural considerations – are all taken into account when planning and/or implementing technology change.

[[File:Dakeyne disc engine animation.gif|right|thumb|Operation of the Dakeyne nutating disk engine]]

A '''nutating disc engine''' (also sometimes called a '''disc engine''') is an [[internal combustion]] [[engine]] comprising fundamentally of one moving part and a direct drive onto the [[crankshaft]].  Initially patented in 1993, it differs from earlier internal combustion engines in a number of ways and utilizes a circular rocking or wobbling ''[[Nutation (engineering)|nutating motion]]'', drawing heavily from similar steam-powered engines developed in the 19th century, and similar to the motion of the non-rotating portion of a swash plate on a [[swash plate engine]].

==Operation==
In its basic configuration the core of the engine is a nutating non-rotating disc, with the center of its hub mounted in the middle of a Z-shaped shaft. The two ends of the shaft [[rotate]], while the disc "[[wikt:nutate|nutates]]", (performs a wobbling motion without rotating around its axis). The motion of the disc [[circumference]] prescribes a portion of a [[sphere]]. A portion of the area of the disc is used for intake and [[compression (physical)|compression]], a portion is used to [[Seal (mechanical)|seal]] against a center casing, and the remaining portion is used for [[Thermal expansion|expansion]] and [[exhaust system|exhaust]]. The compressed air is admitted to an external [[pressure vessel|accumulator]], and then into an external [[combustion chamber]] before it is admitted to the power side of the disc. The external combustion chamber enables the engine to use [[diesel fuel]] in small engine sizes, giving it unique capabilities for [[unmanned aerial vehicle]] propulsion and other applications.  One significant benefit of the nutating engine is the overlap of the power strokes.

Power is transmitted directly to the output shaft, (the [[crankshaft]]), completely eliminating the need for complicated [[linkage (mechanical)|linkages]] essential in a conventional piston engine (to convert the piston's linear motion to rotating output motion). Since the disc does not rotate, the seal velocities are lower than in an equivalent IC piston engine. The total seal length is rather long, however, which may negate this advantage.

The disc wobbles inside a housing and, in its simplest version, half of the single disc (one lobe) performs the intake/compression function while the other lobe performs the power/exhaust function. The disc lobes can be configured to have equal compression and expansion volumes, or to have the compression volume greater than or less than
the expansion volume. This means that the engine can be self supercharged (see [[supercharger]]), or operate as a [[Miller cycle]] / [[Atkinson cycle]].

==Patents and Production History==
U.S. patent number 5,251,594 was granted to Leonard Meyer of Illinois in 1993 for a "nutating internal combustion disc engine".&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite patent

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Meyer Nutating Engine is a new type of internal combustion engine with higher power density than conventional reciprocating piston engines and which can operate on a variety of fuels, including gasoline, heavy fuels and hydrogen. The patent made reference to various 20th-century nutating engines in the United States, but no reference at all to the original Dakeyne engine, described below, in its prior art. The similarity to its 166-year-old hydraulic predecessor is strikingly evident, the main change being that the disc is not entirely flat but slightly convex.

The details of operation as well as the potential of the Meyer nutating disk engine has been published by Professor [[Theodosios Alexander|T. Alexander]] (publishes as T. Korakianitis) and co-workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

A single [[prototype]] has been run briefly under its own power, with a power- to-weight ratio equal to those of typical current four-stroke engines. It is claimed by the authors of the developer/[[United_States_Army_Research_Laboratory|US Army Research Laboratory]]/[[NASA]] technical evaluation report that a production version of the new engine (for UAV applications) might provide a [[power-to-weight ratio]] of 1.6&amp;nbsp;hp/lb or 2.7&amp;nbsp;kW/kg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gltrs.grc.nasa.gov/reports/2006/TM-2006-214342.pdf ''The Nutating Engine—Prototype Engine Progress Report and Test Results''], (Peter L. Meitner, U.S. Army Research Laboratory, Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio),(Mike Boruta and Jack Jerovsek, KINETIC/BEI LLC, South Elgin, Illinois) NASA/TM—2006-214342 ARL–MR–0641 U.S. ARMY RESEARCH LABORATORY, Fig. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; This is slightly better than current automotive production engines&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sportscardesigner.com/hp_per_lb.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; but nowhere near the Graupner G58&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barnardmicrosystems.com/L4E_2_stroke.htm Two stroke engines for UAV: info collected by BML]&lt;/ref&gt; or the Desert Air DA 150.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.desertaircraft.com/engines_detail.php?Page=DA-150 Desert Aircraft]&lt;/ref&gt;

A company called McMasters, previously headed by successful American entrepreneur [[Harold McMaster]], is also developing a nutating motor burning a mixture of pure [[hydrogen]] and pure [[oxygen]] that, it claims, will give 200&amp;nbsp;hp but weigh only one-tenth that of gasoline/air production automotive engines with the same output. So far the McMasters company claims to have spent $10 million on its development. Plans are also being made to develop a version "the size of a coffee can" that can be built directly into wheel hubs, eliminating the traditional drive train entirely. This concept was first attempted in the British Leyland [[Mini Moke]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} but was, at that time, severely hampered by lack of reliable synchronization&amp;nbsp;– which is now more commonplace because of ubiquitous miniaturized [[Embedded system|embedded]] modern day [[computer chips]]. A [[gasoline]]-powered version is also planned by McMasters, which is claimed to give substantially cleaner operation than traditional engines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcmastermotor.com/technical.htm McMaster Motor&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Dakeyne hydraulic disc engine===
In the 1820s the mill owners Edward &amp; James Dakeyne of [[Darley Dale]], [[Derbyshire]] designed and had constructed a [[hydraulic engine]] (a [[water engine]]) known as "The Romping Lion" to make use of the high-pressure water available near their mill.

The Dakeyne brothers had previously also invented "The Equalinium", a machine for the preparation of flax for spinning, and their father Daniel Dakeyne (1733–1819)&lt;ref name=glover&gt;{{cite book | last = Glover | first = Stephen  | title = The History of the County of Derby | publisher = Henry Mozley and Son | year = 1829 | location =  | nopp =  | page = 363 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9gQVAAAAQAAJ | isbn =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; was granted a patent for this device in 1794. It is often said that Edward and James did not take out the patent themselves because they were minors at the time, but in fact they were 23 and 21.

Little is known of their engine other than from the somewhat unclear description accompanying the patent, which was granted in 1830. Its main castings were made at the Morley Park foundry near [[Heage]], and it weighed 7 tons and generated 35 horsepower at a head of 96 feet of water.

Stephen Glover, in his gazetteer of Derbyshire, was enthusiastic about the prospects for the disc engine, foreseeing its use in all manner of applications, domestic as well as industrial, not only as a prime mover but also as a pump. He stated that John Dakeyne had also commissioned a disc engine to drive the bellows of an organ in the family's residence, Knabb House.&lt;ref&gt;

  |year=1833}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frank Nixon in his book "The Industrial Archaeology of Derbyshire" (1969) commented that "The most striking characteristic of this ingenious machine is perhaps the difficulty experienced by those trying to describe it; the patentees &amp; Stephen Glover only succeeded in producing descriptions of monumental incomprehensibility".&lt;ref&gt;

A larger model was constructed to drain lead mines at [[Alport]] near [[Youlgreave]] and many steam versions were subsequently built by other people.

===Davies and Taylor===
The first people to develop steam-powered disc engines based on the Dakeynes' design were George Davies and Henry Taylor who patented their engine in 1836.  It was fitted with valves to control the admission of steam and also differed from the Dakeynes' version in that the axis of the engine was horizontal and the casing of the engine rotated around the disc, the opposite of the original. More patents followed over the next eight years, mainly introducing expansive working and improving the engine's sealing.

In 1836 Davies and Taylor granted manufacturing rights for the engine to Fardon and Gossage, owners of a salt works. At the same time Davies was working on a canal tug with a disc engine driving a paddle wheel at the stern. By 1838 a 5&amp;nbsp;hp engine was in use at the salt works pumping brine.

In 1839 Davies, Taylor, Fardon and Gossage conveyed manufacturing rights to the engine to the Birmingham Patent Disc Engine company. As Superintendent of the Company, Henry Davies was responsible for all design and manufacture, while Gossage was a director. In February 1841 the Board reported that 26 engines had been completed, further engines totalling 260 horsepower were in progress, and a total of 500 horsepower were on order.  They could make engines ranging from 5 to 30 horsepower and were currently making engines for a railway carriage. An article in a French journal of 1841 reported that a 12&amp;nbsp;hp engine had been in use for six months as a winding engine at Corbyn's Hall Mine, [[Dudley]], which could lift a load of 1 ton 180&amp;nbsp;ft in 1 minute. The disc engines cost from £96 for an 8&amp;nbsp;hp machine to £300 for a 30&amp;nbsp;hp model.

Ransomes of Ipswich (who were later to become the well known agricultural engineers, [[Ransomes and Sims]]) exhibited  a [[portable steam engine]] at the [[Royal Liverpool Show]] in 1841, powered by a 5&amp;nbsp;hp BPDE disc engine.

By 1840 a canal boat, ''The Experiment'', powered by a Davies engine, was being used for propellor testing, and in 1842 Davies installed a disc engine and disc pump in a canal barge which he demonstrated by draining {{frac|1|2}} mile of the Stourbridge canal. The same year, a 5&amp;nbsp;hp engine was fitted in one of HMS ''Geyser's'' [[pinnace (ship's boat)|pinnace]]s. However, trials on the Thames and for the Directors of the Grand Junction canal failed to convince either the Admiralty or the canal owners.

Nevertheless, there was a growing interest in using steam power on the canals, and the small beam of canal boats very much favoured disc engines. Davies saw his opportunity and built an iron-hulled canal tug with a 16&amp;nbsp;hp BPDE engine in 1843. To minimise wash he fitted four propellors spaced along a shaft the length of the boat and enclosed in a tube below the waterline. There were two of these propulsion units side by side for a total of 8 propellors. It worked well enough to convince the Directors of the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal to order six tugs which could tow as many as sixteen barges a day at a reasonable speed. In use, a train of six to eight barges left Ellesmere Port and Wolverhampton each day, carrying an average of 100 tons. Unfortunately nobody had considered how the barge train was to transit through the canal locks and shallows. Each such obstruction meant that the train had to be uncoupled and the barges individually manhandled or towed by horse through the obstruction before the train was reassembled on the other side. This negated the benefits of the tug and train and in 1845 the canal's Directors removed the tugs from service.

In 1844 the BPDE collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Burn | first = Robert Scott | title = The Steam Engine | publisher = Ward and Lock | year = 1857 | location = London | nopp =  | pages = 108–109 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=w2UpAAAAYAAJ | isbn =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The workshop equipment, various completed engines and quantities of work in progress were offered for sale. During legal proceedings in 1851 following the bankruptcy of two of the BPDE's principal investors, it was said that the disc engine had not made a profit and that to have relied on it as a realisable asset "was absurd".

===Bishopp===
A competitor to Davies and Taylor was former locomotive engineer [[George Daniell Bishopp]], who had [[Bryan Donkin|Donkin &amp; Co]] build his first engine in 1840, and a patent was granted in 1845.  The partners Barnard William Farey and Bryan Donkin Jr. patented improvements to the basic design; Donkin had worked with Bishopp on his original engine, while Farey was an employee of Donkins.

Bishopp's engine met with some scepticism from the trade press when it was launched on the market. But Bishopp had opted to revert to the Dakeynes' original design which had a yoke which took most of the dynamic forces and greatly reduced the load on the bearings and seals. In the event that there was any leakage, the seals were adjustable. In addition, Bishopp had his engines produced by companies with recognised engineering capabilities rather than carrying out his own manufacturing; as well as Donkin's, some of his first engines were built by [[Joseph Whitworth|Joseph Whitworth &amp; Co]] of Manchester. Another engineering company with a very good reputation was [[J. and G. Rennie|G. Rennie and Son]] of London who were so convinced of the engine's potential that in 1849 they employed Bishopp as their foreman of works with specific responsibility for the disc engine.

By 1849 a number of Bishopp engines had been sold, and one was used with great success to run the printing presses of the ''[[The Times|Times]]'' newspaper, while another produced by G. Rennie and Son was used to power the iron gunboat HMS ''Minx''. The ''Times'' engine had been built by Whitworth and had been shown at the [[Great Exhibition of 1851]] where it ran smoothly and quietly and impressed all who saw it.

In 1853 a disc engine 13&amp;nbsp;inches in diameter was purchased from Rennie to propel a 55&amp;nbsp;foot Russian gunboat, which it did at a speed of {{convert|7|kn}}.&lt;ref name=tmm&gt;{{cite book | title = The Mechanics' Magazine | publisher = Robertson, Brooman, and Co. | year = 1855 | location = London | nopp =  | pages = 267–268 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=W5wAAAAAMAAJ | isbn =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time the advantages of the disc engine were listed in 1855 by ''[[The Mechanics' Magazine]]'' as:&lt;ref name=tmm/&gt;
* It was as much as half the weight of a conventional steam engine of equivalent power
* It had the advantages of rotary steam engines without their inconvenience
* It was more economical in terms of fuel: as much as 18%
* It was capable of higher RPM without needing gearing
* It was suited to high-pressure use

Disc engines ultimately fell into disuse due to the competition offered by modern high speed steam engines which were small and light and could offer features such as compounding. Additionally, conventional engines did not require the same precision manufacture as disc engines and steam leakage was not a problem.

===Water meters===
The nutating disc meter which uses the same geometry and concept as the Dakeynes' original engine&lt;ref&gt;[http://niagarameters.com/products/nutating_disc/nutating_disc.asp Niagara Meters: Nutating Disc Drawing&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.herseymeters.com/prod_disp_400.html Hersey Meters - 400 Series Positive Displacement Disc Water Meter&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; is probably the most widely used [[flowmeter]] in the world, and it is claimed that more than half the water meters installed in domestic premises in the US and Europe are of this type. Used for 150 years, it is essentially a Dakeyne Disc Engine and was most probably developed by Farey and Donkin who mentioned a "fluid measurement meter" in their 1850 disc engine patent granted in 1850. By 1859 they were being manufactured by the Buffalo Meter Company of [[Buffalo, New York]].

A '''shell''' is a payload-carrying [[projectile]] that, as opposed to [[round shot|shot]], contains an explosive or other filling, though modern usage sometimes includes large solid projectiles properly termed '''shot'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/shells|title=shells|author=|date=|publisher=|via=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed lead|date=July 2016}} Solid shot may contain a pyrotechnic compound if a [[tracer ammunition|tracer]] or spotting charge is used. Originally, it was called a "bombshell", but "shell" has come to be unambiguous in a military context.

All explosive- and incendiary-filled projectiles, particularly for [[mortar (weapon)|mortars]], were originally called ''grenades'', derived from the pomegranate, so called because the many-seeded fruit suggested the powder-filled, fragmenting bomb, or from the similarity of shape. Words cognate with ''grenade'' are still used for an artillery or mortar projectile in some European languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=grenade&amp;searchmode=none |title=Etymology of grenade |publisher=Etymonline.com |date=1972-01-08 |accessdate=2013-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shells are usually large-caliber projectiles fired by [[artillery]], [[combat vehicle]]s (including [[tank]]s), and [[warship]]s.

Shells usually have the shape of a [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] topped by an [[ogive]]-shaped nose for good aerodynamic performance, possibly with a tapering base (boat-tail); but some specialized types are quite different.

==History==
Solid cannonballs ("shot") did not need a [[Artillery fuse|fuse]], but hollow [[munition]]s ("shells") filled with something such as gunpowder to fragment the ball, needed a fuse, either impact ([[Artillery fuze#Percussion fuzes|percussion]]) or time. Percussion fuses with a spherical projectile presented a challenge because there was no way of ensuring that the impact mechanism contacted the target. Therefore, shells needed a time fuse that was ignited before or during firing and burned until the shell reached its target.

==Early shells==
{{see also|History of gunpowder}}
[[File:Chinese Cannon.JPG|thumb|right|210px|The 'flying-cloud thunderclap-eruptor' cannon from the ''[[Huolongjing]]'']]
The earliest record of shells being used in combat was by the [[Republic of Venice]] at Jadra in 1376. Shells with fuses were used at the 1421 siege of St Boniface in [[Corsica]]. These were two hollowed  hemispheres of stone or bronze held together by an iron hoop.&lt;ref name="Hogg pg 164"&gt;Hogg pg 164&lt;/ref&gt;

Written evidence for early explosive shells in China appears in the early [[Ming Dynasty]] (1368&amp;ndash;1644) [[China|Chinese]] military manual ''[[Huolongjing]]'', compiled by [[Jiao Yu]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 14th to early 15th century) and [[Liu Bowen]] (1311&amp;ndash;1375) sometime before the latter's death, a preface added by Jiao in 1412.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 24 25 264"&gt;Needham, Joseph. (1986). Science and Civilization in China: Volume 5, Chemistry and Chemical Technology, Part 7, Military Technology; the Gunpowder Epic. Taipei: Caves Books Ltd. Page 24&amp;ndash;25, 264.&lt;/ref&gt; As described in their book, these hollow, gunpowder-packed shells were made of [[cast iron]].&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 24 25 264"/&gt; At least since the 16th Century grenades made of ceramics or glass were in use in Central Europe. A hoard of several hundred ceramic grenades were discovered during building works in front of a bastion of the Bavarian City of [[Ingolstadt]], [[Germany]] dated to the 17th Century. Lots of the grenades contained their original blackpowder loads and igniters. Most probably the grenades were intentionally dumped in the moat of the bastion before the year 1723.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Franzkowiak | first1 = Andreas | last2 = Wenzel | first2 = Chris | title = Explosives aus der Tiefgarage - Ein außergewöhnlicher Keramikgranatenfund aus Ingolstadt | journal = Sammelblatt des historischen Vereins Ingolstadt | volume = 125 | pages = 95–110 | date = 2016 | language = German | issn = 1619-6074}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early problem was that there was no means of [[accuracy and precision|precisely]] measuring the time to detonation — reliable fuses did not yet exist and the burning time of the powder fuse was subject to considerable trial and error. Early powder burning fuses had to be loaded fuse down to be ignited by firing or a portfire put down the barrel to light the fuse. Other shells were wrapped in [[bitumen]] cloth, which would ignite during the firing and in turn ignite a powder fuse. Nevertheless, shells came into regular use in the 16th Century, for example a 1543 English mortar shell was filled with 'wildfire'.

[[File:Boshin War mortar.jpg|thumb|left|A [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] with a hollowed shell from the [[Boshin war]]]]
By the 18th Century, it was known that the fuse toward the muzzle could be lit by the flash through the [[British ordnance terms#Windage|windage]] between the shell and the barrel. At about this time, shells began to be employed for [[direct fire|horizontal fire]] from [[howitzer]]s with a small [[propellant|propelling]] charge and, in 1779, experiments demonstrated that they could be used from guns with heavier charges.

The use of exploding shells from field artillery became relatively commonplace from early in the 19th century. Until the mid 19th century, shells remained as simple exploding spheres that used gunpowder, set off by a slow burning fuse. They were usually made of [[cast iron]], but [[bronze]], [[lead]], [[brass]] and even [[glass]] shell casings were experimented with.&lt;ref&gt;Hogg pg 164 - 165&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''[[bomb]]'' encompassed them at the time, as heard in the lyrics of ''[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]'' ("the bombs bursting in air"), although today that sense of ''bomb'' is obsolete. Typically, the thickness of the metal body was about a sixth of their diameter and they were about two thirds the weight of solid shot of the same caliber.

To ensure that shells were loaded with their fuses toward the muzzle, they were attached to wooden bottoms called ''[[sabot]]s''. In 1819, a committee of British artillery officers recognized that they were essential stores and in 1830 Britain standardized sabot thickness as a half inch.&lt;ref&gt;Hogg pg 165&lt;/ref&gt; The sabot was also intended to reduce jamming during loading. Despite the use of exploding shell, the use of smoothbore cannons firing spherical projectiles of shot remained the dominant artillery method until the 1850s.

==Modern shell==
The mid 19th century saw a revolution in artillery, with the introduction of the first practical [[Rifled breech loader|rifled breech loading]] weapons. The new methods resulted in the reshaping of the spherical shell into its modern recognizable cylindro-conoidal form. This shape greatly improved the in-flight stability of the projectile and meant that the primitive time fuzes could be replaced with the percussion fuze situated in the nose of the shell. The new shape also meant that further, armor-piercing designs could be used.

During the 20th Century, shells became increasingly streamlined. In World War I, ogives were typically two circular radius head (crh) - the curve was a segment of a circle having a radius of twice the shell caliber. After that war, ogive shapes became more complex and elongated. From the 1960s, higher quality steels were introduced by some countries for their HE shells, this enabled thinner shell walls with less weight of metal and hence a greater weight of explosive. Ogives were further elongated to improve their ballistic performance.

===Rifled breech loaders===
{{main|Rifled breech loader}}
[[File:Sagahan Armstrong gun used at the Battle of Ueno against the Shogitai 1868.jpg|thumb|The [[Armstrong gun]] was a pivotal development for modern artillery as the first practical [[rifled breech loader]]. Pictured, deployed by [[Japan]] during the [[Boshin war]] (1868–69).|right]]
Advances in metallurgy in the industrial era allowed for the construction of [[rifled breech loader|rifled breech-loading guns]] that could fire at a much greater [[muzzle velocity]]. After the British artillery was shown up in the [[Crimean War]] as having barely changed since the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the industrialist [[William Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong|William Armstrong]] was awarded a contract by the government to design a new piece of artillery. Production started in 1855 at the [[Elswick Ordnance Company]] and the [[Royal Arsenal]] at [[Woolwich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Marshall J. Bastable|title=From Breechloaders to Monster Guns: Sir William Armstrong and the Invention of Modern Artillery, 1854-1880|journal=Technology and Culture|doi=10.2307/3105857|volume=33|page=213|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/William_Armstrong|title=William Armstrong}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The piece was [[rifling|rifled]], which allowed for a much more accurate and powerful action. Although rifling had been tried on small arms since the 15th century, the necessary machinery to accurately rifle artillery only became available in the mid-19th century. [[Martin von Wahrendorff]] and [[Joseph Whitworth]] independently produced rifled cannon in the 1840s, but it was Armstrong's gun that was first to see widespread use during the Crimean War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/gabrmetz/gabr001b.htm|title= The Emergence of Modern War}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[cast iron]] shell of the Armstrong gun was similar in shape to a [[Minié ball]] and had a thin lead coating which made it fractionally larger than the gun's bore and which engaged with the gun's [[rifling]] grooves to impart spin to the shell. This spin, together with the elimination of [[British ordnance terms#Windage|windage]] as a result of the tight fit, enabled the gun to achieve greater range and accuracy than existing smooth-bore muzzle-loaders with a smaller powder charge.

The gun was also a breech-loader. Although attempts at breech-loading mechanisms had been made since medieval times, the essential engineering problem was that the mechanism couldn't withstand the explosive charge. It was only with the advances in [[metallurgy]] and [[precision engineering]] capabilities during the [[Industrial Revolution]] that Armstrong was able to construct a viable solution. Another innovative feature was what Armstrong called its "grip", which was essentially a squeeze [[Gauge (bore diameter)|bore]]; the 6 inches of the bore at the muzzle end was of slightly smaller diameter, which centered the shell before it left the barrel and at the same time slightly [[swage]]d down its lead coating, reducing its diameter and slightly improving its ballistic qualities.

Rifled guns were also developed elsewhere - by Major Giovanni Cavalli and Baron [[Martin von Wahrendorff]] in Sweden, [[Krupp]] in Germany and the [[Wiard rifle|Wiard gun]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Hogg pg 80 - 83&lt;/ref&gt; However, rifled barrels required some means of engaging the shell with the rifling. Lead coated shells were used with the [[Armstrong gun]], but were not satisfactory so studded projectiles were adopted. However, these did not seal the gap between shell and barrel. Wads at the shell base were also tried without success.

In 1878, the British adopted a copper '[[Gas check|gas-check]]' at the base of their studded projectiles and in 1879 tried a rotating gas check to replace the studs, leading to the 1881 automatic gas-check. This was soon followed by the Vavaseur copper driving band as part of the projectile. The driving band rotated the projectile, centered it in the bore and prevented gas escaping forwards. A driving band has to be soft but tough enough to prevent stripping by rotational and engraving stresses. [[Copper]] is generally most suitable but [[cupronickel]] or [[gilding metal]] were also used.&lt;ref name="Hogg pg 165 - 166"&gt;Hogg pg 165 - 166&lt;/ref&gt;

===Percussion fuze===
{{main|Artillery fuze}}
Although an early percussion fuze appeared in 1650 that used a flint to create sparks to ignite the powder, the shell had to fall in a particular way for this to work and this did not work with spherical projectiles. An additional problem was finding a suitably stable ‘percussion powder’. Progress was not possible until the discovery of [[Mercury(II) fulminate|mercury fulminate]] in 1800, leading to priming mixtures for small arms patented by the Rev [[Alexander John Forsyth|Alexander Forsyth]], and the copper percussion cap in 1818.

The percussion fuze was adopted by Britain in 1842. Many designs were jointly examined by the army and navy, but were unsatisfactory, probably because of the safety and arming features. However, in 1846 the design by Quartermaster Freeburn of the Royal Artillery was adopted by the army. It was a wooden fuze some 6 inches long and used shear wire to hold blocks between the fuze magazine and a burning match. The match was ignited by propellant flash and the shear wire broke on impact. A British naval percussion fuze made of metal did not appear until 1861.&lt;ref&gt;Hogg pg 203 - 203&lt;/ref&gt;

===Smokeless powders===
[[File:Poudre B.JPG|thumb|[[Poudre B]] was the first practical [[smokeless powder]].]]
{{main|Smokeless powder}}
[[Gunpowder]] was used as the only form of explosive up until the end of the 19th century. Guns using black powder ammunition would have their view obscured by a huge cloud of smoke and concealed shooters were given away by a cloud of smoke over the firing position. [[Guncotton]], a nitrocellulose-based material, was discovered by [[Swiss people|Swiss]] chemist [[Christian Friedrich Schönbein]] in 1846. He promoted its use as a blasting explosive&lt;ref name="Handloading28"&gt;Davis, William C., Jr. ''Handloading'' National Rifle Association of America (1981) p.28&lt;/ref&gt; and sold manufacturing rights to the [[Austrian Empire]]. Guncotton was more powerful than gunpowder, but at the same time was somewhat more unstable. John Taylor obtained an English patent for guncotton; and John Hall &amp; Sons began [[Faversham explosives industry|manufacture in Faversham]]. British interest waned after an explosion destroyed the Faversham factory in 1847. Austrian Baron [[Wilhelm Lenk von Wolfsberg]] built two guncotton plants producing artillery propellant, but it was dangerous under field conditions, and guns that could fire thousands of rounds using gunpowder would reach their service life after only a few hundred shots with the more powerful guncotton.

Small arms could not withstand the pressures generated by guncotton. After one of the Austrian factories blew up in 1862, Thomas Prentice &amp; Company began manufacturing guncotton in [[Stowmarket]] in 1863; and British [[War Office]] chemist Sir [[Frederick Abel]] began thorough research at [[Waltham Abbey Royal Gunpowder Mills]] leading to a manufacturing process that eliminated the impurities in nitrocellulose making it safer to produce and a stable product safer to handle. Abel patented this process in 1865, when the second Austrian guncotton factory exploded. After the Stowmarket factory exploded in 1871, Waltham Abbey began production of guncotton for torpedo and mine warheads.&lt;ref name="sharpe141"&gt;Sharpe, Philip B. ''Complete Guide to Handloading'' 3rd Edition (1953) Funk &amp; Wagnalls pp.141-144&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dewar James flask.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Sir [[James Dewar]] developed the [[cordite]] explosive in 1889.]]
In 1884, [[Paul Vieille]] invented a smokeless powder called [[Poudre B]] (short for ''poudre blanche''—white powder, as distinguished from [[gunpowder|black powder]])&lt;ref name="Chemistry289"&gt;Davis, Tenney L. ''The Chemistry of Powder &amp; Explosives'' (1943) pages 289–292&lt;/ref&gt; made from 68.2% insoluble [[nitrocellulose]], 29.8% soluble nitrocellusose gelatinized with [[diethyl ether|ether]] and 2% paraffin. This was adopted for the Lebel rifle.&lt;ref name="Artillery139"&gt;Hogg, Oliver F. G. ''Artillery: Its Origin, Heyday and Decline'' (1969) p.139&lt;/ref&gt; Vieille's powder revolutionized the effectiveness of small guns, because it gave off almost no smoke and was three times more powerful than black powder. Higher [[muzzle velocity]] meant a flatter [[trajectory]] and less wind drift and bullet drop, making 1000 meter shots practicable. Other European countries swiftly followed and started using their own versions of Poudre B, the first being [[Germany]] and [[Austria]] which introduced new weapons in 1888. Subsequently, Poudre B was modified several times with various compounds being added and removed. [[Krupp]] began adding [[diphenylamine]] as a stabilizer in 1888.&lt;ref name="sharpe141"/&gt;

Britain conducted trials on all the various types of propellant brought to their attention, but were dissatisfied with them all and sought something superior to all existing types. In 1889, Sir [[Frederick Abel]], [[James Dewar]] and Dr W Kellner patented (Nos 5614 and 11,664 in the names of Abel and Dewar) a new formulation that was manufactured at the Royal Gunpowder Factory at Waltham Abbey. It entered British service in 1891 as [[Cordite]] Mark 1. Its main composition was 58% Nitro-glycerine, 37% Guncotton and 3% mineral jelly. A modified version, Cordite MD, entered service in 1901, this increased guncotton to 65% and reduced nitro-glycerine to 30%, this change reduced the combustion temperature and hence erosion and barrel wear. Cordite could be made to burn slower which reduced maximum pressure in the chamber (hence lighter breeches, etc.), but longer high pressure, significant improvements over gunpowder. Cordite could be made in any desired shape or size.&lt;ref name="Artillery141"&gt;Hogg, Oliver F. G. ''Artillery: Its Origin, Heyday and Decline'' (1969) p.141&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of cordite led to a lengthy court battle between Nobel, Maxim, and another inventor over alleged British [[patent]] infringement.

==Other shell types==
[[File:Carcass shell.jpg|right|frame|Drawing of a [[Carcass (projectile)|carcass shell]]]]
A variety of fillings have been used in shells throughout history. An incendiary shell was invented by Valturio in 1460. The [[Carcass (projectile)|carcass shell]] was first used by the French under [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] in 1672.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicolas Édouard Delabarre-Duparcq]] and [[George Washington Cullum]]. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=DJ9DAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover Elements of Military Art and History]''. 1863. p 142.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially in the shape of an [[Rectangle|oblong]] in an iron frame (with poor ballistic properties) it evolved into a spherical shell. Their use continued well into the 19th century.

A modern version of the incendiary shell was developed in 1857 by the British and was known as ''Martin's shell'' after its inventor. The shell was filled with molten iron and was intended to break up on impact with an enemy ship, splashing molten iron on the target. It was used by the Royal Navy between 1860 and 1869, replacing [[Heated shot]] as an anti-ship, incendiary projectile.&lt;ref name="Jobson2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Philip Jobson|title=Royal Artillery Glossary of Terms and Abbreviations: Historical and Modern|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hmX0DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT346|date=2 September 2016|publisher=History Press|isbn=978-0-7509-8007-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two patterns of incendiary shell were used by the British in World War 1, one designed for use against Zeppelins.&lt;ref&gt;Hogg pg 171 - 174&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to incendiary shells were star shells, designed for illumination rather than arson. Sometimes called lightballs they were in use from the 17th Century onwards. The British adopted parachute lightballs in 1866 for 10, 8 and 5{{frac|1|2}} inch calibers. The 10-inch wasn't officially declared obsolete until 1920.&lt;ref name="Hogg pg 174 - 176"&gt;Hogg pg 174 - 176&lt;/ref&gt;

Smoke balls also date back to the 17th Century, British ones contained a mix of saltpetre, coal, pitch, tar, resin, sawdust, crude antimony and sulphur. They produced a 'noisome smoke in abundance that is impossible to bear'. In 19th century British service, they were made of concentric paper with a thickness about 1/15th of the total diameter and filled with powder, saltpeter, pitch, coal and tallow. They were used to 'suffocate or expel the enemy in casemates, mines or between decks; for concealing operations; and as signals.&lt;ref name="Hogg pg 174 - 176"/&gt;

During the [[First World War]], [[shrapnel shell]]s and explosive shells inflicted terrible casualties on infantry, accounting for nearly 70% of all war casualties and leading to the adoption of steel [[helmet]]s on both sides. Shells filled with poison [[gas (chemical warfare)|gas]] were used from 1917 onwards. Frequent problems with shells led to many military disasters when shells failed to explode, most notably during the 1916 [[Battle of the Somme]].

==Propulsion==
Artillery shells are differentiated by how the shell is loaded, propelled and the type of breech mechanism:

===Fixed ammunition===
With this style of ammunition, there are three main components the [[Fuze|fuzed]] projectile, the [[Cartridge (firearms)|casing]] to hold the propellants and [[Detonator|primer]], and the single propellant charge.  With a fixed round everything is included in one ready to use package and in British ordnance, terms are called [[Glossary of British ordnance terms#Fixed QF|fixed quick firing]].  Often guns which use fixed ammunition use [[Rifled breech loader#The sliding block|sliding-block]] or sliding-wedge breeches and the case provides [[obturation]] which seals the [[Breech-loading weapon|breech]] of the gun and prevents propellant gasses from escaping.  Sliding block breeches can be horizontal or vertical.  Advantages of fixed ammunition are simplicity, safety, moisture resistance and speed of loading.  Disadvantages are eventually a fixed round becomes too long or too heavy to load by a gun crew.  Another issue is the inability to vary propellant charges to achieve different velocities and ranges.  Lastly, there's the issue of resource usage since a fixed round uses a case, which can be an issue in a prolonged war if there are metal shortages.&lt;ref name=":Hogg"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/571972|title=Artillery|last=Hogg|first=Ian|date=1972|publisher=Scribner|others=Batchelor, John H.|year=|isbn=0684130920|location=New York,|pages=|oclc=571972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Separate loading cased charge===
With this style of ammunition there are three main components: The fuzed projectile, the casing to hold the propellants and primer, and the bagged propellant charges.  With a separate loading cased charge round the casing, bagged propellant charges and projectile are usually separated into two or more parts.  In British ordnance terms, this type of ammunition is called [[Glossary of British ordnance terms#Separate QF|separate quick firing]].  Often guns which use separate loading cased charge ammunition use sliding-block or sliding-wedge breeches and during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] Germany predominantly used fixed or separate loading cased charges and sliding block breeches even for their largest guns.  A variant of separate loading cased charge ammunition is '''semi-fixed''' ammunition.  With semi-fixed ammunition the round comes as a complete package but the projectile and its case can be separated.  The case holds a set number of bagged charges and the gun crew can add or subtract propellant to change range and velocity.  The round is then reassembled and fired.  Advantages include easier handling for large rounds, while range and velocity can be varied by using more or fewer propellant charges.  Disadvantages include more complexity, slower loading, less safety, less moisture resistance and the metal cases can still be a resource issue.&lt;ref name=":Hogg" /&gt;

===Separate loading bagged charge===
With this style of ammunition there are three main components the fuzed projectile, the bagged charges and the primer.  Like separate loading cased charge ammunition, the number of propellant charges can be varied.  However, this style of ammunition does not use a cartridge case and it achieves obturation through a [[Interrupted screw|screw breech]] instead of a sliding block.  Sometimes when reading about artillery the term separate loading ammunition will be used without clarification of whether a cartridge case is used or not, in which case refer to the type of breech used.  Heavy artillery pieces and [[Naval artillery]] tend to use bagged charges and projectiles because the weight and size of the projectiles and propelling charges can be more than a gun crew can manage.  Advantages include easier handling for large rounds, decreased metal usage, while range and velocity can be varied by using more or fewer propellant charges.  Disadvantages include more complexity, slower loading, less safety and less moisture resistance.&lt;ref name=":Hogg" /&gt;

===Range enhancing technologies {{Anchor|RAP}}===
Extended range shells are sometimes used. These special shell designs may be [[Rocket Assisted Projectile]]s ('''RAP''') or [[base bleed]] to increase range. The first has a small rocket motor built into its base to provide additional thrust. The second has a pyrotechnic device in its base that bleeds gas to fill the partial vacuum created behind the shell and hence reduce base-drag. These shell designs usually have reduced HE filling to remain within the permitted weight for the projectile, and hence less lethality.

==Sizes==

[[File:US Army WWII field artillery.jpg|thumb|155 mm American artillery shells, March 1945]]
{{see also|British standard ordnance weights and measurements|List of British ordnance terms}}
The [[caliber]] of a shell is its [[diameter]]. Depending on the historical period and national preferences, this may be specified in millimeters, centimeters, or inches. The length of gun barrels for large [[cartridge (firearms)|cartridges]] and shells (naval) is frequently quoted in terms of the ratio of the barrel length to the bore size, also called [[Caliber (artillery)|caliber]]. For example, the [[16"/50 caliber Mark 7 gun]] is 50 calibers long, that is, 16"×50=800"=66.7 feet long. Some guns, mainly British, were specified by the weight of their shells (see below).

Explosive rounds as small as [[Breda-SAFAT machine gun|12.7 x 82]] and [[MG 131 machine gun|13 x 64]] millimeter have been used on aircraft and armored vehicles, but their small explosive yield have led some nations to limit their explosive rounds to 20 mm or larger.  International Law precludes the use of explosive ammunition for use against individual persons, but not against vehicles and aircraft.  The largest shells ever fired were those from the German super-[[railway gun]]s, [[Schwerer Gustav|Gustav and Dora]], which were 800 mm (31.5 in) in caliber. Very large shells have been replaced by [[rocket]]s, [[missiles]], and [[bombs]], and today the largest shells in common use are 155 mm (6.1 in).

Gun calibers have standardized around a few common sizes, especially in the larger range, mainly due to the uniformity required for efficient military logistics. Shells of 105 and 155 mm for artillery and 105mm and 120 mm for [[tank gun]]s in [[NATO]]. Artillery shells of 122, 130 and 152 mm, and tank gun ammunition of 100, 115, or 125 mm caliber remain in use in Eastern Europe, Western Asia, Northern Africa, and Eastern Asia. Most common calibers have been in use for many years, since it is [[logistics|logistically]] complex to change the caliber of all guns and ammunition stores.

The weight of shells increases by and large with caliber. A typical 155 mm (6.1 in) shell weighs about 50 kg, a common 203 mm (8 in) shell about 100 kg, a concrete demolition 203 mm (8 in) shell 146 kg, a 280 mm (11 in) battleship shell about 300 kg, and a 460 mm (18 in) battleship shell over 1,500 kg. The [[Schwerer Gustav]] [[supergun]] fired 4.8 and 7.1 tonne shells.

During the 19th century, the British adopted a particular form of designating artillery. Field guns were designated by nominal standard projectile weight, while howitzers were designated by barrel caliber. British guns and their ammunition were designated in [[pound (mass)|pound]]s, e.g., as "two-pounder" shortened to "2-pr" or "2-pdr". Usually, this referred to the actual weight of the standard projectile (shot, shrapnel or HE), but, confusingly, this was not always the case.

Some were named after the weights of obsolete projectile types of the same caliber, or even obsolete types that were considered to have been functionally equivalent. Also, projectiles fired from the same gun, but of non-standard weight, took their name from the gun. Thus, conversion from "pounds" to an actual barrel diameter requires consulting a historical reference. A mixture of designations were in use for land artillery from the First World War (such as the [[BL 60-pounder gun]], [[RML 2.5 inch Mountain Gun]], 4 inch gun, 4.5 inch howitzer) through to the end of World War II (5.5 inch medium gun, [[Ordnance QF 25-pounder|25-pounder gun]]-howitzer, 17-pounder tank gun), but the majority of naval guns were by caliber. After World War II, guns were designated by caliber.

There are many different types of shells. The principal ones include:

===Armor-piercing shells===
{{main|armor-piercing shell}}
With the introduction of the first [[ironclad]]s in the 1850s and 1860s, it became clear that shells had to be designed to effectively pierce the ship armor. A series of British tests in 1863 demonstrated that the way forward lay with high-velocity lighter shells. The first [[armor-piercing shot and shell|pointed armor-piercing shell]] was introduced by Major Palliser in 1863. Approved in 1867, [[Palliser shot and shell]] was an improvement over the ordinary elongated shot of the time. Palliser shot was made of [[cast iron]], the head being chilled in casting to harden it, using composite molds with a metal, water cooled portion for the head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.lycos.co.uk/Juan39/THE_HUASCAR.html|title=Build a Free Website with Web Hosting - Tripod|author=|date=|website=members.lycos.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Britain also deployed Palliser shells in the 1870s-1880s. In the shell, the cavity was slightly larger than in the shot and was filled with 1.5% gunpowder instead of being empty, to provide a small explosive effect after penetrating armor plating. The shell was correspondingly slightly longer than the shot to compensate for the lighter cavity. The powder filling was ignited by the shock of impact and hence did not require a fuze.&lt;ref name=ToA1887&gt;"[[Treatise on Ammunition]]", 4th Edition 1887, pp. 203-205.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, ship armor rapidly improved during the 1880s and 1890s, and it was realised that explosive shells with [[steel]] had advantages including better fragmentation and resistance to the stresses of firing. These were cast and forged steel.&lt;ref name="Hogg pg 165 - 166"/&gt;

AP shells containing an explosive filling were initially distinguished from their non-HE counterparts by being called a "shell" as opposed to "shot".  By the time of the Second World War, AP shells with a bursting charge were sometimes distinguished by appending the suffix "HE". At the beginning of the war, APHE was common in [[anti-tank]] shells of 75 mm caliber and larger due to the similarity with the much larger naval armor piercing shells already in common use.  As the war progressed, ordnance design evolved so that the bursting charges in APHE became ever smaller to non-existent, especially in smaller caliber shells, e.g. [[Panzergranate 39]] with only 0.2% HE filling.

===High-explosive shells===
{{Redirect|High-explosive shell|the material|high explosives}}
[[File:75mm melanite shell section for instruction.jpg|thumb|right|[[Picric acid]] was used in the first high-explosive shells. Cut out section of a high-explosive shell belonging to a [[Canon de 75 modèle 1897]].]]
Although smokeless powders were used as a propellant, they could not be used as the substance for the explosive warhead, because shock sensitivity sometimes caused [[detonation]] in the artillery barrel at the time of firing. [[Picric acid]] was the first high-explosive nitrated [[organic compound]] widely considered suitable to withstand the shock of firing in conventional [[artillery]]. In 1885, based on research of Hermann Sprengel, French chemist [[Eugène Turpin]] patented the use of pressed and cast picric acid in [[Rock blasting|blasting]] charges and [[artillery shell]]s. In 1887, the French government adopted a mixture of picric acid and guncotton under the name ''Melinite''. In 1888, Britain started manufacturing a very similar mixture in [[Lydd]], Kent, under the name ''Lyddite''.

Japan followed with an "improved" formula known as ''[[shimose powder]]''. In 1889, a similar material, a mixture of ammonium cresylate with trinitrocresol, or an ammonium salt of trinitrocresol, started to be manufactured under the name ''[[ecrasite]]'' in [[Austria-Hungary]]. By 1894, Russia was manufacturing artillery shells filled with picric acid. Ammonium picrate (known as ''Dunnite'' or [[explosive D]]) was used by the United States beginning in 1906.&lt;ref name="brown"&gt;Brown, G.I. (1998) ''The Big Bang: a History of Explosives'' Sutton Publishing {{ISBN|0-7509-1878-0}} pp.151-163&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marc Ferro. ''The Great War''. London and New York: Routeladge Classics, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Germany began filling artillery shells with [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]] in 1902. [[Toluene]] was less readily available than phenol, and TNT is less powerful than picric acid, but the improved safety of munitions manufacturing and storage caused the replacement of picric acid by TNT for most military purposes between the World Wars.&lt;ref name="brown"/&gt; However, pure TNT was expensive to produce and most nations made some use of mixtures using cruder TNT and ammonium nitrate, some with other compounds included. These fills included Ammonal, Schneiderite and [[Amatol]]. The latter was still in wide use in [[World War II]].

The percentage of shell weight taken up by its explosive fill increased steadily throughout the 20th Century. Less than 10% was usual in the first few decades; by [[World War II]], leading designs were around 15%. However, British researchers in that war identified 25% as being the optimal design for [[anti-personnel]] purposes, based on the recognition that far smaller fragments than hitherto would give a better effect. This guideline was achieved by the 1960s with the 155 mm L15 shell, developed as part of the German-British [[FH-70]] program. The key requirement for increasing the HE content without increasing shell weight was to reduce the thickness of shell walls, which required improvements in high tensile steel.

[[File:15in howitzer Menin Rd 5 October 1917.jpg|thumb|15 inch high-explosive [[howitzer]] shells, circa 1917]]
The most common shell type is [[high explosive]], commonly referred to simply as HE. They have a strong [[steel]] case, a bursting charge, and a [[Artillery fuse|fuse]]. The fuse detonates the bursting charge which shatters the case and scatters hot, sharp case pieces (''fragments'', ''splinters'') at high velocity. Most of the damage to soft targets, such as unprotected personnel, is caused by shell pieces rather than by the blast. The term "shrapnel" is sometimes used to describe the shell pieces, but [[shrapnel shell]]s functioned very differently and are long obsolete. The speed of fragments is limited by [[Gurney equations]]. Depending on the type of [[Artillery fuse|fuse]] used the HE shell can be set to burst on the ground (percussion), in the air above the ground, which is called called air burst&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.pl/books?id=nBXSdMCUuBIC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=airburst+artillery+shells&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hGTZDBFDVn&amp;sig=LXHgw8cYD-iid1o1RdiPd_kFzgY&amp;hl=pl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiI26jU7tnXAhWEFJoKHfZ9Aow4ChDoAQgqMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=airburst+artillery+shells&amp;f=false|title=Rain of Fire: Israel's Unlawful Use of White Phosphorus in Gaza|first=Human Rights Watch|last=(Organization)|date=31 July 2018|publisher=Human Rights Watch|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.pl/books?id=U3QsvhRetkcC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;dq=airburst+artillery+shells&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fafHo5qoMN&amp;sig=5J4lqxt0VkD2lqX-B2pogNi6PTY&amp;hl=pl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjk8fq87tnXAhVpIpoKHUMrBioQ6AEIcjAN#v=onepage&amp;q=airburst+artillery+shells&amp;f=false|title=Royal Artillery|author=|date=|publisher=PediaPress|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; (time or [[Proximity fuze|proximity]]), or after penetrating a short distance into the ground (percussion with delay, either to transmit more ground shock to covered positions, or to reduce the spread of fragments).  Projectiles with enhanced fragmentation are called high-explosive fragmentation (HE-FRAG).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forecastinternational.com/archive/disp_pdf.cfm?DACH_RECNO=818 |title=Ordnance &amp; Munitions Forecast |date=2010 |website=www.forecastinternational.com |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[RDX]] and TNT mixtures are the standard chemicals used, notably [[Composition B]] and [[Cyclotol]]. The introduction of 'insensitive munition' requirements, agreements and regulations in the 1990s caused modern western designs to use various types of plastic bonded explosives (PBX) based on RDX.

====Common====
[[File:BL9.2inchCommonShellMkV.jpg|thumb|190x190px|BL 9.2 in Common shell Mk V.]]
[[Glossary of British ordnance terms#Common shell|Common shells]] designated in the early (i.e. 1800s) British explosive shells were filled with "low explosives" such as "P mixture" (gunpowder) and usually with a fuze in the nose. Common shells on bursting (non-detonating) tended to break into relatively large fragments which continued along the shell's trajectory rather than laterally. They had some incendiary effect.

In the late 19th century "double common shells" were developed, lengthened so as to approach twice the standard shell weight, to carry more powder and hence increase explosive effect. They suffered from instability in flight and low velocity and were not widely used.

As at 1914, common shells 6 inch and up were of cast steel, smaller shells were of forged steel for service and cast iron for practice.{{sfnp|Treatise on Ammunition|1915|pages= 158, 159, 198 }} They were replaced by "common lyddite" shells in the late 1890s but some stocks remained as late as 1914.  In British service common shells were typically painted black with a red band behind the nose to indicate the shell was filled.

====Common pointed====
[[File:QF12&amp;14pdrCPMkIIShellDiagram.jpg|thumb|[[Glossary of British ordnance terms#Fixed QF|QF]] [[QF 12-pounder 12 cwt naval gun|12 pounder]] common pointed shell|192x192px]]
[[Glossary of British ordnance terms#CP|Common pointed shells]], or CP were a type of common shell used in naval service from the 1890s - 1910s which had a solid nose and a percussion fuze in the base rather than the common shell's nose fuze. The ogival two C.R.H. solid pointed nose was considered suitable for attacking shipping but was not armor-piercing - the main function was still explosive. They were of cast or forged (three- and six-pounder) steel and contained a gunpowder bursting charge slightly smaller than that of a common shell, a trade off for the longer heavier nose.{{sfnp|Treatise on Ammunition|1915|page= 161 }}

In British service common pointed shells were typically painted black, except 12-pounder shells specific for QF guns which were painted lead colour to distinguish them from 12-pounder shells usable with both BL and QF guns. A red ring behind the nose indicated the shell was filled.

By World War II they were superseded in Royal Navy service by common pointed capped (CPC) and semi-armor piercing ([[#S.A.P.|SAP]]), filled with TNT.

====Common lyddite====
[[File:BL6inchMkVIILydditeShell.jpg|thumb|Common lyddite six-inch naval shell.|199x199px]]
[[Glossary of British ordnance terms#Common lyddite|Common lyddite shells]] were British explosive shells filled with [[Lyddite]] were initially designated "common lyddite" and beginning in 1896 were the first British generation of modern "high explosive" shells. Lyddite is [[picric acid]] fused at 280 °F and allowed to solidify, producing a much denser dark-yellow form which is not affected by moisture and is easier to detonate than the liquid form. Its French equivalent was "melinite", Japanese equivalent was "shimose". Common lyddite shells "detonated" and fragmented into small pieces in all directions, with no incendiary effect. For maximum destructive effect the explosion needed to be delayed until the shell had penetrated its target.

Early shells had walls of the same thickness for the whole length, later shells had walls thicker at the base and thinning towards the nose. This was found to give greater strength and provide more space for explosive.{{sfnp|Treatise on Ammunition|1915|pages=37, 158, 159, 198 }} Later shells had [[#C.R.H.|4 c.r. heads]], more pointed and hence streamlined than earlier 2 c.r.h. designs.

Proper detonation of a lyddite shell would show black to grey smoke, or white from the steam of a water detonation. Yellow smoke indicated simple explosion rather than detonation, and failure to reliably detonate was a problem with lyddite, especially in its earlier usage. To improve the detonation "exploders" with a small quantity of picric powder or even of TNT (in smaller shells, 3 pdr, 12 pdr - 4.7 inch) was loaded between the fuze and the main lyddite filling or in a thin tube running through most of the shell's length.

Lyddite presented a major safety problem because it reacted dangerously with metal bases. This required that the interior of shells had to be varnished, the exterior had to be painted with leadless paint and the fuze-hole had to be made of a leadless alloy. Fuzes containing any lead could not be used with it.

When World War I began Britain was replacing lyddite with modern "high explosive" (HE) such as TNT. After World War I the term "common lyddite" was dropped, and remaining stocks of lyddite-filled shells were referred to as HE (high explosive) shell filled lyddite. Hence "common" faded from use, replaced by "HE" as the explosive shell designation.

Common lyddite shells in British service were painted yellow, with a red ring behind the nose to indicate the shell had been filled.

====Mine shell====
{{Main|Minengeschoß}}
The mine shell is a particular form of HE shell developed for use in small caliber weapons such as 20 mm to 30 mm cannon. Small HE shells of conventional design can contain only a limited amount of explosive. By using a thin-walled steel casing of high tensile strength, a larger explosive charge can be used. Most commonly the explosive charge also was a more expensive but higher-detonation-energy type.

The ''mine shell'' concept was invented by the Germans in the Second World War primarily for use in aircraft guns intended to be fired at opposing aircraft. Mine shells produced relatively little damage due to fragments, but a much more powerful blast. The [[aluminium]] structures and skins of Second World War [[aircraft]] were readily damaged by this greater level of blast.

===Shrapnel shells===
{{Main|Shrapnel shell}}
[[File:Shrapnel (PSF).png|thumb|right|Typical World War I shrapnel round :&lt;br&gt;1 shell bursting charge&lt;br&gt;2 bullets&lt;br&gt;3 nose fuze&lt;br&gt;4 central ignition tube&lt;br&gt;5 resin matrix&lt;br&gt;6 thin steel shell wall&lt;br&gt;7 cartridge case&lt;br&gt;8 propellant]]
[[Shrapnel shell]]s are an anti-personnel munition which delivered large numbers of [[bullet]]s at ranges far greater than rifles or machine guns could attain - up to 6,500 yards by 1914. A typical shrapnel shell as used in World War I was streamlined, 75 mm (3 in) in diameter and contained approximately 300 lead–antimony balls (bullets), each around 1/2 inch in diameter. Shrapnel used the principle that the bullets encountered much less air resistance if they travelled most of their journey packed together in a single streamlined shell than they would if they travelled individually, and could hence attain a far greater range.

The gunner set the shell's [[Artillery fuze#Time fuzes|time fuze]] so that it was timed to burst as it was angling down towards the ground just before it reached its target (ideally about 150 yards before, and 60–100 feet above the ground&lt;ref&gt;I.V. Hogg &amp; L.F. Thurston, ''British Artillery Weapons &amp; Ammunition''. London: Ian Allan, 1972. Page 215.&lt;/ref&gt;). The fuze then ignited a small "bursting charge" in the base of the shell which fired the balls forward out of the front of the shell case, adding 200–250 ft/second to the existing velocity of 750–1200  ft/second. The shell body dropped to the ground mostly intact and the bullets continued in an expanding cone shape before striking the ground over an area approximately 250 yards × 30 yards in the case of the US 3 inch shell.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas T Hamilton, [https://archive.org/details/shrapnelshellman00hamirich "Shrapnel Shell Manufacture. A Comprehensive Treatise.". New York: Industrial Press, 1915, Page 13]&lt;/ref&gt; The effect was of a large shotgun blast just in front of and above the target, and was deadly against troops in the open. A trained gun team could fire 20 such shells per minute, with a total of 6,000 balls, which compared very favorably with rifles and machine-guns.

However, shrapnel's relatively flat trajectory (it depended mainly on the shell's velocity for its lethality, and was lethal only in the forward direction) meant that it could not strike trained troops who avoided open spaces and instead used dead ground (dips), shelters, trenches, buildings, and trees for cover. It was of no use in destroying buildings or shelters. Hence, it was replaced during World War I by the high-explosive shell, which exploded its fragments in all directions (and thus more difficult to avoid) and could be fired by high-angle weapons, such as howitzers.

===Cluster and sub-munition===
Cluster shells are a type of carrier shell or cargo munition. Like [[cluster bomb]]s, an artillery shell may be used to scatter smaller sub-munitions, including anti-personnel [[grenade]]s, anti-tank top-attack munitions, and [[land mine|landmines]]. These are generally far more lethal against both [[armored fighting vehicle|armor]] and [[infantry]] than simple high-explosive shells, since the multiple munitions create a larger kill zone and increase the chance of achieving the direct hit necessary to kill armor. Most modern armies make significant use of [[cluster munition]]s in their artillery batteries.

However, in operational use, sub-munitions have demonstrated a far higher malfunction rate than previously claimed, including those that have self-destruct mechanisms. This problem, the "dirty battlefield", led to the [[Ottawa Treaty]].

Artillery-scattered mines allow for the quick deployment of [[minefield]]s into the path of the enemy without placing engineering units at risk, but artillery delivery may lead to an irregular and unpredictable minefield with more unexploded ordnance than if mines were individually placed.

Signatories of the [[Ottawa Treaty]] have renounced the use of cluster munitions of all types where the carrier contains more than ten sub-munitions.

===Chemical===
[[File:155mmMustardGasShells.jpg|thumb|right|155 mm artillery shells containing [[mustard gas|HD]] (nitrogen mustard) agent at [[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]] chemical weapons storage facility – Note the colour-coding scheme on each shell.]]
Chemical shells contain just a small explosive charge to burst the shell, and a larger quantity of a [[chemical weapon|chemical agent]] such as a poison gas. Signatories of the [[Chemical Weapons Convention]] have renounced such shells.

===Non-lethal shells===
Not all shells are designed to kill or destroy. The following types are designed to achieve particular non-lethal effects. They are not completely harmless: smoke and illumination shells can accidentally start fires, and impact by the discarded carrier of all three types can wound or kill personnel, or cause minor damage to property.

====Smoke====
The smoke shell is designed to create a [[smoke screen]]. The main types are bursting (those filled with white [[phosphorus]] WP and a small HE bursting charge are best known) and base ejection (delivering three or four smoke canisters, or material impregnated with white phosphorus). Base ejection shells are a type of carrier shell or cargo munition.

Base ejection smoke is usually white, however, colored smoke has been used for marking purposes. The original canisters were non-burning, being filled with a compound that created smoke when it reacted with atmospheric moisture, modern ones use red phosphorus because of its multi-spectral properties. However, other compounds have been used; in World War II, Germany used [[oleum]] (fuming sulfuric acid) and [[pumice]].

==== Illumination ====&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Starshell]] and [[Star shell]] --&gt;
[[File:British 4 inch 35 lb star shell 1943 diagram.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;British World War II 4-inch naval illuminating shell, showing [[Artillery fuze#Time fuzes|time fuze]] (orange, top), illuminating compound (green) and parachute (white, bottom)&lt;/center&gt;]]
Modern illuminating shells are a type of carrier shell or cargo munition. Those used in World War I were shrapnel pattern shells ejecting small burning 'pots'.

A modern illumination shell has a time fuze that ejects a flare 'package' through the base of the carrier shell at a standard height above ground (typically about 600 metres), from where it slowly falls beneath a non-flammable [[parachute]], illuminating the area below. The ejection process also initiates a [[pyrotechnics|pyrotechnic]] flare emitting white or 'black' [[infrared]] light.

[[File:Flares fired by M777 howitzers to illuminate during Operation Tora Arwa V in the Kandahar province Aug. 2 2009.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Illumination rounds fired from a [[M777 howitzer]]]]
Typically illumination flares burn for about 60 seconds. These are also known as ''starshell'' or ''star shell''. Infrared illumination is a more recent development used to enhance the performance of night vision devices. Both white and black light illuminating shells may be used to provide continuous illumination over an area for a period of time, and may use several dispersed aimpoints to illuminate a large area. Alternatively firing single illuminating shells may be coordinated with the adjustment of HE shell fire onto a target.

Colored flare shells have also been used for target marking and other signaling purposes.
{{clear}}

====Carrier====
The carrier shell is simply a hollow carrier equipped with a fuze that ejects the contents at a calculated time. They are often filled with [[propaganda]] leaflets (see external links), but can be filled with anything that meets the weight restrictions and is able to withstand the shock of firing. Famously, on Christmas Day 1899 during the [[siege of Ladysmith]], the [[Afrikaner|Boer]]s fired into Ladysmith a carrier shell without a fuze, which contained a [[Christmas pudding]], two [[Union Flag]]s and the message "compliments of the season". The shell is still kept in the museum at Ladysmith.

====Proof shot====
{{Main|Proof test}}
A [[proof shot]] is not used in combat but to confirm that a new gun barrel can withstand operational stresses. The proof shot is heavier than a normal shot or shell, and an oversize propelling charge is used, subjecting the barrel to greater than normal stress. The proof shot is inert (no explosive or functioning filling) and is often a solid unit, although water, sand or iron powder filled versions may be used for testing the gun mounting. Although the proof shot resembles a functioning shell (of whatever sort), so that it behaves as a real shell in the barrel, it is not aerodynamic as its job is over once it has left the muzzle of the gun. Consequently, it travels a much shorter distance and is usually stopped by an earth bank for safety measures.

The gun, operated remotely for safety in case it fails, fires the proof shot, and is then inspected for damage. If the barrel passes the examination, "[[proof mark]]s" are added to the barrel. The gun can be expected to handle normal ammunition, which subjects it to less stress than the proof shot, without being damaged.

===Guided shells===
Guided or "smart" ammunition have been developed in recent years, but have yet to supplant unguided munitions in all applications.

==Unexploded shells==
{{Main|Unexploded ordnance}}
[[File:PzH2000Munition.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Modern 155 mm artillery ammunition – these shells are unusual in having two driving bands. The shell on the right is a modified M107.]]
The [[Artillery fuze|fuze]] of a shell has to keep the shell safe from accidental functioning during storage, due to (possibly) rough handling, fire, etc. It also has to survive the violent launch through the barrel, then reliably function at the appropriate moment. To do this it has a number of arming mechanisms which are successively enabled under the influence of the firing sequence.

Sometimes, one or more of these arming mechanisms fail, resulting in a projectile that is unable to detonate. More worrying (and potentially far more hazardous) are fully armed shells on which the fuze fails to initiate the HE firing. This may be due to a shallow trajectory of fire, low-velocity firing or soft impact conditions. Whatever the reason for failure, such a shell is called a ''blind'' or ''unexploded ordnance ([[UXO]])'' (the older term, "dud", is discouraged because it implies that the shell ''cannot'' detonate.) Blind shells often litter old battlefields; depending on the impact velocity, they may be buried some distance into the earth, all the while remaining potentially hazardous. For example, antitank ammunition with a piezoelectric fuze can be detonated by relatively light impact to the piezoelectric element, and others, depending on the type of fuze used, can be detonated by even a small movement. The battlefields of the First World War still claim casualties today from leftover munitions. Modern electrical and mechanical fuzes are highly reliable: if they do not arm correctly, they keep the initiation train out of line or (if electrical in nature) discharge any stored electrical energy.

Smart Cells are currently in the research and development stage but support [[Software-defined networking|software-defined networks]] which are proliferating the current mobile network structure, led by AT&amp;T's adoption.&lt;ref name="eweek1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lundquist|first=Eric|title=AT&amp;T to Take Leading Role in Adopting Software-Defined Networks|url=http://www.eweek.com/networking/att-to-take-leading-role-in-adopting-software-defined-networks.html|publisher=eWeek|accessdate=2014-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to John Donovan (AT&amp;T), "This is the way we will build our network.".&lt;ref name="eweek1"/&gt;

Smart Cells are expected to lower capital and operational costs due to reduced equipment and manual manipulations needed to modify cell site coverage. ''The term Smart Cell is also used to identify other technologically enhanced cell sites where technology has reduced the need to manually manipulate radio access equipment or add additional carriers at a radio access node.'' Similar to Software-defined networking, Smart Cells may replace the existing static technologies with a dynamic, more efficient solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What’s Software-Defined Networking (SDN)?|url=http://www.sdncentral.com/what-the-definition-of-software-defined-networking-sdn/|accessdate=2014-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swedish-made '''Svea 123''' is a small liquid-fuel ([[naphtha]], commonly referred to as ''[[white gas]]'' or ''[[Coleman fuel]]'') [[Portable stove#Pressurized liquid fuel stoves|pressurized-burner camping stove]] that traces its origins to designs first pioneered in the late 19th century.

==History==
[[File:Nybergs Sundbyberg.jpg|thumb|235px|C. R. Nybergs Lödlampfabrik]]
Svea stoves were first made by C.R. Nybergs Lödlampfabrik, which also manufactured [[Blow torch|blowtorches]] as well as other machinery and equipment.  Founded by [[Carl Rickard Nyberg|Carl Nyberg]], the firm later became one of the largest industries in [[Sundbyberg]], [[Sweden]].  In 1922, the business was taken over by Max Sievert, an early associate of Nyberg's, and renamed Sieverts Lödlampfabrik (later known as Sievert AB).  The Svea 123, introduced in 1955, is considered to be the first compact [[Backpacking (wilderness)|backpacking]] white gas stove&lt;ref&gt;''Outside'' Magazine, April 2002, "The Gear Years 1875-2002."&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the most popular [[camping]] stoves ever made.&lt;ref&gt;H. Manning, ''Backpacking: One Step At A Time'', p.274 (Vintage Books 1980)&lt;/ref&gt;  Its distinctive "roaring" sound has been likened to that of a jet engine at takeoff.&lt;ref&gt;''Outsideonline'', Nov. 12, 2002, "Gear Guy – Do you know of a camping stove that's not too noisy?"&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1969, the Svea brand was acquired by Optimus,&lt;ref name="Westways Magazine"&gt;''Westways'' Magazine, "Gear for Travel," Vol. 63, No. 9, p. 81 (September 1971)&lt;/ref&gt; another Swedish manufacturer of portable stoves, which has continued production of the Svea 123 to the present day.  Because of its simple design&lt;ref&gt;B. Mason, ''Song of the Paddle: An Illustrated Guide to Wilderness Camping'', p.50 (Firefly Books 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; and reputation for dependable performance,&lt;ref name="Mueser"&gt;R. Mueser, ''Long Distance Hiking: Lessons learned from the Appalachian Trail'', p.58 (Ragged Mountain Press 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; even under extreme conditions,&lt;ref&gt;F. Bouwman, ''The Practical Camp Book'', p.84 (Horizon 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; the Svea 123 enjoys a devoted following.

The popularity of portable camping stoves such as the Svea coincided with the increase during the 1950s and 1960s in the awareness of the environmental impact of backpacking,&lt;ref&gt;C. Jensen &amp; S. Guthrie, ''Outdoor Recreation in America'', p.31 (Human Kinetics 6th Ed. 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in heavily-traveled areas,&lt;ref&gt;S. Cox &amp; K. Fulsaas, ''Mountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills'', pp.123-24 (Mountaineers Books 7th Ed. 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; and the rise of the [[leave no trace]] ethic in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;A. McGibney, "Leave No Trace: A Guide to the New Wilderness Etiquette," pp. 29, 31 (Mountaineers Books 2d Ed. 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, scarcity of fuel in over-used camping areas as well as regulatory requirements (open-fire bans) also contributed to the need for a substitute for [[campfire|open campfires]] for "wilderness" area cooking.&lt;ref&gt;M. Mouland, ''The Complete Idiot's Guide to Camping and Hiking'', p.74 (Alpha Books 2nd Ed. 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;  Eventually stoves that were lighter in weight than the Svea, as well as those of other designs that were capable of burning a wider variety of fuels (useful when camping in other parts of the world where white gas is difficult to find) knocked it from its perch as one of the most popular backpacking stoves after nearly 50 years of production.&lt;ref&gt;C. Townsend, "The Backpacker's Handbook," p.216, 221 (International Marine/Ragged Mountain Press 2d Ed. 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the rugged and durable Svea 123—often described by long-time users as "bomb-proof"&lt;ref&gt;C. Latimer, ''Wilderness Cuisine'', p.65 (Wilderness Press 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;—still remains popular and continues in wide use.&lt;ref&gt;A. Getchell &amp; R. Getchell, "The Essential Outdoor Gear Manual," p.96 (International Marine/Ragged Mountain Press 2d Ed. 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction ==

Made of solid [[brass]], the Svea 123 weighs about {{convert|500|g}}, measures {{convert|100|x|130|mm}} and will burn for over an hour on full tank (about 4 ounces) of fuel.  Later models (designated the Svea 123R and also sold as the Optimus Climber&lt;ref&gt;"Portable Fire," ''Backpacker'' Magazine, p. 199 (March 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;) were made with a built-in cleaning needle to keep the [[Nozzle#Jet|burner jet]] from clogging by pushing [[soot]] or other [[impurity|impurities]] outward; early Sievert models without the self-cleaning needle came with a small wire pricker that is used to clean the burner jet manually by pushing the soot inwards.  These older models are distinguishable by their downwardly-angled spindle and control valve, to which the adjusting key is attached.  The spindle on a Svea 123R with the self-cleaning needle is at a right angle to the stem.  Other differences between older and newer models include the vaporizer on older models, which is smooth, while newer models of both the Svea 123 and the 123R are finned and have a stronger joint configuration at the base.  The [[Safety valve|pressure-relief valve]] in the filler cap has also been redesigned several times to improve both reliability as well as re-seating of the valve after it has opened.&lt;ref&gt;R. Smutek (ed.), "Stoves for Mountaineering," in ''Off Belay'' Magazine, p. 16 (Off Belay Reprint Series 1975).&lt;/ref&gt;  The pentagonal hole in the pressure relief valve is designed as a vent, not a key socket.  The valve disassembles easily with a pliers. A brass windscreen attaches directly to the stove, and has built-in pot supports that fold inward for storage.  The [[aluminum]] lid comes with a detachable handle and can also be used as a small cook-pot.&lt;ref&gt;Optimus Svea 123 Instruction Guide (undated), circa 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

== How it works ==

===Stove lighting and operation===
[[File:Svea 123 Stove Components.jpg|thumb|235px|Svea 123 stove components]]
To light the stove, the fuel tank must first be pre-heated and pressurized by lighting a small amount of fuel poured into the primer pan or spirit cup (a small well) on top of the tank at the base of the [[vaporizer (internal combustion engine)|vaporizer]] (the vertical stem connecting the fuel tank to the burner).  Alternatively, the primer pan can be filled directly from the fuel tank by opening the [[control valves|control valve]] and warming the fuel tank by holding it in one’s hands.  This will increase the pressure in the fuel tank and force a small amount of fuel to trickle out of the burner jet and into the primer pan.&lt;ref&gt;Sievert Svea 123 Instruction Guide (undated), circa 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;  The control valve must then be closed before lighting the priming fuel so as to allow pressure to build up in the tank when the exterior fuel begins to heat the tank and the fuel within.  The tank can also be pressurized by an optional pump that may be attached to the filler cap, but this is generally not necessary except in extreme cold.  Fuel from the tank is fed by a [[cotton]] wick inside the tank to the base of the vaporizer.  The heat and pressure created by the priming flame [[Vaporization|vaporizes]] the fuel inside the vaporizer.  When the priming flame is nearly burnt out, the control valve is opened by turning the adjusting key.  This allows the vaporized fuel to flow under pressure through the burner jet (a small opening at the base of the burner), where it mixes with [[oxygen]] and burns with a blue flame.  Adjusting the flow of the vaporized fuel that is forced through the burner jet controls the flame size and heat output.  The control valve (a spindle) is threaded in the vaporizer's housing, and as it is opened (by turning the adjusting key) it opens like a [[Tap (valve)|faucet]] (counter-clockwise to open and clockwise to close) and the vaporized fuel flows through the burner jet. Closing the spindle closes the fuel supply.  A small plate on the top of the burner (a flame spreader) spreads the flame outwards.  The heat generated in the burner and vaporizer maintains the internal pressure in the fuel tank.&lt;ref&gt;"Backpacking Stoves," ''Backpacker'' Magazine, p. 47 (August 1976)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Optimus Product Guide, p. 6 (undated; circa 1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Burner design and flame efficiency===
[[File:Gasoline Stove Burner Design.jpg|thumb|left|185px|Svea 123 burner design]]
Like most gasoline stoves, the Svea 123 uses an inverted bell-shaped burner topped with a flame spreader (sometimes called a ''target burner''&lt;ref&gt;F. Saxon (ed.), "Tolley’s Basic Science and Practice of Gas Service," p. 106 (Newnes 4th Ed. 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; or ''plate burner''&lt;ref&gt;F. Saxon (ed.), M. Mouland, "The Complete Idiot's Guide to Hiking and Camping," p. 75 (Penguin Books 2nd Ed. 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; design).  As the vaporized fuel exits the jet, it shoots upward and strikes the bottom of the flame spreader, where it mixes with air that is drawn into the burner housing by [[Convection#Flames and convection|convection]] and, more importantly at higher flow rates, by [[Bernoulli effect]] [[entrainment (hydrodynamics)|entrainment]].  The air/fuel mixture flows around the bottom of the flame spreader where it burns with a blue flame.  In this type of burner design, flame efficiency depends on how fast the vaporized fuel strikes the flame spreader and on how well the air and vaporized fuel mixes beneath the flame spreader (i.e., the amount of turbulence in the air/fuel mixing zone).  As a result, this design works best at high fuel output levels; efficient combustion is indicated by a blue flame.  As the fuel output is decreased (i.e., when the control valve is turned down) the velocity with which the fuel exits the jet is also decreased, and fuel mixing (i.e., the amount of turbulence in the air/fuel mixing zone) is likewise decreased.  At very low fuel output levels, the fuel will no longer exit with sufficient velocity to fully strike the flame spreader and combustion will consequently be very inefficient, usually indicated by a yellow flame.&lt;ref&gt;R. Smutek (ed.), "Stoves for Mountaineering," in Off Belay Magazine, pp. 16-17 (Off Belay Reprint Series 1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internal cleaning needle===
The cleaning needle on the Svea 123R model has two small toothed [[gear|cogs]] that face each other, which cleans the burner jet from both the inside and outside when using the stove.  The cleaning needle moves upward and downward when the spindle is turned; when the spindle is fully opened, the needle clears the burner jet's opening.  As the spindle is closed, the needle retracts into the burner housing.  In this way, any soot that may clog the burner jet is expelled.

== Reliability ==

Because the Svea 123 is made of brass and has only one moving part – the control valve (the later Svea 123R model has an additional moving part, the internal self-cleaning needle) – the Svea has a well-established record of reliability and can withstand years of heavy use with only minimal maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;C. Townsend, "The Advanced Backpacker: A Handbook of Year Round, Long-Distance Hiking ," pp. 161-62 (Ragged Mountain Press 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Some users have reported operational problems with the self-cleaning needle on the 123R, such as that the stove may not simmer as well as the earlier Sievert models,&lt;ref&gt;R. Wood, ''The 2 oz. Backpacker: A Problem Solving Manual for Use in the Wilds'', p.94 (Ten Speed Press 1982)&lt;/ref&gt; but reports from years of field use of the Svea on the [[Appalachian Trail]] indicate that it has the lowest record of clogging among stoves used on the trail.&lt;ref name="Mueser"/&gt;

Some common but nonrecommended practices can adversely affect the Svea's performance and reliability.  For example, when using a wind screen or shield other than the built-in wind screen (such as the flexible aluminum foil windscreens used with stoves made by [[Mountain Safety Research]]), care should be taken not to wrap the windscreen too tightly around the stove because this may cause the stove to overheat and the fuel tank to over-pressurize.&lt;ref&gt;"Stoves: Brand-Specific Hints," Backpacker Magazine, p. 57 (March 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;  This in turn will cause the [[Safety valve|pressure-relief valve]] in the filler cap to open and the over-pressurized gas vapor to escape, which may catch fire and result in a dangerous "flareup" or large fireball.&lt;ref&gt;"Outfitting," ''Backpacker'' Magazine, p. 101 (June 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, while the Svea is capable of burning [[Gasoline|unleaded automobile gasoline]], only [[naphtha]] or [[Coleman fuel]] is recommended: Coleman fuel contains [[rust inhibitor]]s and is specially refined for use in camping stoves, while automotive fuel contains [[Gasoline additive|additives]] that vaporize when burned and leave gumlike deposits behind that causes clogging.&lt;ref&gt;"White Gas vs. Coleman Fuel," ''Backpacker'' Magazine, p. 10 (December 1976)&lt;/ref&gt;  The stove should also not be allowed to run dry because doing so will burn or char the cotton wick inside the fuel tank,  which will inhibit the wick's ability to draw fuel to the vaporizing tube.&lt;ref&gt;J. Fleming, ''The Well-Fed Backpacker'', p. 53 (Vintage Books 3d Ed. 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Similar designs and copies ==

The Svea 123 shares a number of design features with several other small [[portable stove]]s. 
[[File:Primus 71L.jpg|thumb|left|135px|Primus 71L stove]]
In the 1930s, Sieverts Lödlampfabrik (maker of the original Svea 123) produced the Campus No. 3 stove.  Much like the later-produced Svea, it was a self-pressurizing stove with an integrated windscreen and an aluminum lid that doubled as a cook-pot, but was slightly narrower and taller (80&amp;nbsp;mm x 150&amp;nbsp;mm) than the Svea.  Because of its small size, the Campus No. 3 was advertised as a "boon to Hikers, Cyclists, and Travellers generally."&lt;ref&gt;Svea Product Catalog, p. 10 (undated, circa 1935)&lt;/ref&gt;  Also in the 1930s, Optimus introduced the No. 6 stove, which was nearly identical to the Svea 123 in size, weight, capacity, operation and design.&lt;ref&gt;Optimus Product Catalog No. 1500 E, p. 52 (undated; circa 1939)&lt;/ref&gt;  Optimus dropped the No. 6 in the 1940s and did not produce a similar model until its acquisition of the Svea line in 1969.&lt;ref name="Westways Magazine"/&gt;

The Juwel 33 and 34 (made by [[Gustav Barthel]] of [[Dresden]] which, like Sieverts, was a maker of blowtorches and stoves) is a [[World War II]]-era [[Germany|German]] [[military]] field stove of similar size, design and operation to the Svea.&lt;ref&gt;G. Rottman, "German Field Fortifications 1939-1945," p. 37 (Osprey 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;  The Arara 37, another German-made stove, is similar,&lt;ref&gt;A. Sainz, ''Deutsche Soldaten: The Uniforms, Equipment and Personal Effects of the German Soldier 1939-1945'', p. 268 (Casemate 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; as is the [[Czechoslovakia|Czech]]-made Meva Type 2140.  More recently manufactured stoves with the same design features as the Svea include the [[Soviet Union|Russian]]-made Примус Туристский ПТ-2 "Огонёк" (Primus Tourist PT-2 "Little Flame"), the German-made Enders "Biwak" ("Bivouac") No. 2650, and the Juwel 84, which is essentially a larger and more recent version of the World War II-era Juwel 34.  The Lion G102 stove, manufactured by the Jaeil Metal Co., Ltd. of [[South Korea]] during the 1990s, is nearly identical to the Svea, but with curved brass pot supports attached to the top of the windscreen instead of the straight metal supports used on the Svea.  

[[File:Stansport Pak Cook 235.jpg|thumb|70px|Pak-Cook stove]]
The Swedish-made Primus 71 and the similar Optimus 80 have a larger fuel tank and are slightly taller and heavier than the Svea.  (After Optimus acquired the rights to the [[Primus stove|Primus]] name for liquid-fueled stoves in 1962, the Primus 71 and Optimus 80 were identical,&lt;ref&gt;C. Fletcher, ''The New Complete Walker: The Joys and Techniques of Hiking and Backpacking'', p. 157 (Knopf 1974)&lt;/ref&gt; except for the name and markings.&lt;ref&gt;E. Drew, ''The Complete Light-pack Camping and Trail-foods Cookbook'', p. 164 (McGraw-Hill 1977)&lt;/ref&gt;)  However, instead of the integrated windscreen on the Svea, the Primus 71 and Optimus 80 stoves fit inside a [[sheet-metal]] case for transport that when opened serves as the stove's windscreen and pot support.  The type of fuel used and the method of operation of the Primus 71 is the same as the Svea.&lt;ref name="Primus Catalog"&gt;Primus Product Catalog, p. 32 (undated, circa 1955)&lt;/ref&gt;  The Primus 70 is similar, but with a cylindrical aluminum container instead of a sheet-metal box.&lt;ref name="Primus Catalog"/&gt;  The Radius 42, another Swedish-made stove, dates from the 1920s and is slightly smaller than the Primus 71, but is otherwise the same general design.&lt;ref&gt;Katalog No. 30, Aktiebolaget Radius (Radius Product Catalog), p. 37 (Feb. 1932)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Taiwan]]ese-made [[Knock Off|knock-offs]] of the Svea 123 include the Fire-Lite and Trav-ler 77, and the Pak-Cook 235 marketed in the United States under the Stansport and Texsport names.

== Description ==
WowCube is a cube which consists of eight self-contained modules, which have 24 subdisplays collectively and rotate like elements of Rubik’s Cube. Magnetic connectors ensure continuous data exchange between the self-contained modules and the streamlined gaming process. Several games have been designed for WowCube, including [[puzzles]], [[brain-teasers]], [[Scrabble]], [[platformers]], and [[mazes]]. The gaming experience provided by WowCube is based on the [[mixed reality]] approach, which combines twisting and shaking the cube in reality with digital actions visualized on 24 squared subdisplays.

The console combines the properties of physical gadgets, such dynamic twiddling toys (e.g., [[Fidget spinner]]), and [[Video game console|digital gaming consoles]] in one unit.

[[File:Wattmeter.jpg|thumb|upright|Wattmeter]]

The '''wattmeter''' is an instrument for measuring the [[electric power]] (or the supply rate of [[electrical energy]]) in [[watt]]s of any given [[Electrical network|circuit]]. Electromagnetic wattmeters are used for measurement of [[utility frequency]] and audio frequency power; other types are required for radio frequency measurements.

==Electrodynamic==
[[File:WattmeterAcostaMexico.JPG|thumb|Early wattmeter on display at the Historic Archive and Museum of Mining in [[Pachuca]], [[Mexico]]]]

The traditional analog wattmeter is an [[electrodynamic]] instrument. The device consists of a pair of fixed [[electromagnetic coil|coils]], known as ''current coils'', and a movable coil known as the ''potential coil''.

The current coils are connected in [[Series and parallel circuits|series]] with the circuit, while the potential coil is connected in [[Series and parallel circuits|parallel]]. Also, on [[analog signal|analog]] wattmeters, the potential coil carries a needle that moves over a scale to indicate the measurement. A current flowing through the current coil generates an [[electromagnetic field]] around the coil. The strength of this field is proportional to the line current and in phase with it. The potential coil has, as a general rule, a high-value [[resistor]] connected in series with it to reduce the current that flows through it.

The result of this arrangement is that on a [[Direct current|DC]] circuit, the deflection of the needle is proportional to ''both'' the [[Electric current|current]] (''I'') ''and'' the [[voltage]] (''V''), thus conforming to the equation ''P''=''VI''. 

For [[AC power]], current and voltage may not be in phase, owing to the delaying effects of circuit [[inductance]] or [[capacitance]]. On an [[alternating current|AC]] circuit the deflection is proportional to the average instantaneous product of voltage and current, thus measuring [[AC power#Real.2C reactive.2C and apparent powers|true power]], ''P''=''VI'' cos ''φ''. Here, cos''φ'' represents the [[power factor]] which shows that the power transmitted may be less than the apparent power obtained by multiplying the readings of a [[voltmeter]] and  [[ammeter]] in the same circuit.

The two circuits of a wattmeter can be damaged by excessive current. The [[ammeter]] and [[voltmeter]] are both vulnerable to overheating&amp;nbsp;— in case of an overload, their pointers will be driven off scale&amp;nbsp;— but in the wattmeter, either or even both the current and potential circuits can overheat ''without'' the pointer approaching the end of the scale. This is because the position of the pointer depends on the [[power factor]], [[voltage]] and current. Thus, a circuit with a low [[power factor]] will give a low reading on the wattmeter, even when both of its circuits are loaded to the maximum safety limit. Therefore, a wattmeter is rated not only in watts, but also in [[volt]]s and [[ampere]]s.

A typical wattmeter in educational labs has two voltage coils (pressure coils) and a current coil. The two pressure coils can be connected in series or parallel to change the ranges of the wattmeter. The pressure coil can also be tapped to change the meter's range. If the pressure coil has range of 300 volts, the half of it can be used so that the range becomes 150 volts.

[[File:Plug-in Power &amp; Energy Monitor in UK Domestic Mains Socket.jpeg|thumb|Prodigit Model 2000MU (UK version), shown in use and displaying a reading of 10 watts being consumed by the appliance]]

Electronic wattmeters are used for direct, small power measurements or for power measurements at frequencies beyond the range of electrodynamometer-type instruments.

=== Digital ===
A modern digital wattmeter samples the voltage and current thousands of times a second. For each sample, the voltage is multiplied by the current at the same instant; the average over at least one cycle is the real power. The real power divided by the apparent [[volt-ampere]]s (VA) is the power factor. A computer circuit uses the sampled values to calculate RMS voltage, RMS current, VA, power (watts), power factor, and kilowatt-hours. The readings may be displayed on the device, retained to provide a log and calculate averages, or transmitted to other equipment for further use. Wattmeters vary considerably in correctly calculating energy consumption, especially when real power is much lower than VA (highly [[Electrical reactance|reactive]] loads, e.g. [[electric motors]]). Simple meters may be calibrated to meet specified accuracy only for [[Sine wave|sinusoidal]] waveforms. Waveforms for [[switched-mode power supplies]] as used for much [[electronic equipment]] may be very far from sinusoidal, leading to unknown and possibly large errors at any power. This may not be specified in the meter's manual.

==Precision and accuracy==
There are limitations to measuring power with inexpensive wattmeters, or indeed with any meters not designed for low-power measurements. This particularly affects low power (e.g. under 10 watts), as used in standby; readings may be so inaccurate as to be useless (although they do confirm that standby power is low, rather than high).&lt;ref name=ll&gt;[http://standby.lbl.gov/measure.html US Lawrence Livermore laboratory, Standby Power, measuring standby]&lt;/ref&gt; The difficulty is largely due to difficulty in accurate measurement of the alternating current, rather than voltage, and the relatively little need for low-power measurements. The specification for the meter should specify the reading error for different situations. For a typical plug-in meter the error in wattage is stated as ±5% of measured value ±10&amp;nbsp;W (e.g., a measured value of 100W may be wrong by 5% of 100&amp;nbsp;W plus 10&amp;nbsp;W, i.e., ±15&amp;nbsp;W, or 85–115&amp;nbsp;W); and the error in kW·h is stated as ±5% of measured value ±0.1&amp;nbsp;kW·h.&lt;ref&gt;Data listed in text from manual for inexpensive plug-in electricity meter Brennenstuhl PM230.  The lowest measurable current is given as 0.02&amp;nbsp;A, which corresponds to about 5&amp;nbsp;W at 230&amp;nbsp;VAC&lt;/ref&gt; If a laptop computer in sleep mode consumes 5&amp;nbsp;W, the meter may read anything from 0 to 15.25&amp;nbsp;W, without taking into account errors due to non-sinusoidal waveform.&lt;!--Typical example: I have found power measured by an accurate wattmeter as 5&amp;nbsp;W to show as 9&amp;nbsp;W on a simple plugin meter. pol098--&gt;  In practice accuracy can be improved by connecting a fixed load such as an incandescent light bulb, adding the device in standby, and using the difference in power consumption.&lt;ref name=ll /&gt; This moves the measurement out of the problematic low-power zone.

==Radio frequency==
Instruments with moving coils can be calibrated for direct current or [[Utility frequency|power frequency]] currents up to a few hundred hertz. At radio frequencies a common method is a rectifier circuit arranged to respond to current in a [[transmission line]]; the system is calibrated for the known circuit impedance. Diode detectors are either directly connected to the source, or used with a sampling system that diverts only a portion of the RF power through the detector.  Thermistors and thermocouples are used to measure heat produced by RF power and can be calibrated either directly or by comparison with a known reference source of power.&lt;ref name=Carr02&gt;Joeseph J. Carr, ''RF Components and Circuits'', Newnes, 2002 {{ISBN|978-0-7506-4844-8}} pages 351-370&lt;/ref&gt; A [[bolometer]] power sensor converts incident radio frequency power to heat. The sensor element is maintained at a constant temperature by a small direct current.  The reduction in current required to maintain temperature is related to the incident RF power. Instruments of this type are used throughout the RF spectrum and can even measure visible light power. For high-power measurements, a calorimeter directly measures heat produced by RF power.&lt;ref name=Carr02 /&gt;

An instrument which measures electrical [[energy]] in [[watt hour]]s ([[electricity meter]] or [[energy analyser]]) is essentially a wattmeter which accumulates or averages readings. Digital electronic instruments measure many parameters and can be used where a wattmeter is needed: volts, current,in amperes, apparent instantaneous power, actual power, power factor, energy in [k]W·h over a period of time, and cost of electricity consumed.
