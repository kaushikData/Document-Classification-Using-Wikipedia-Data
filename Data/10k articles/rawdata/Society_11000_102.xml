The '''2017–18 NCAA Division I men's basketball corruption scandal''' is an ongoing [[corruption]] scandal, initially involving sportswear manufacturer [[Adidas]] as well as several [[college basketball]] programs associated with the brand&lt;ref name="espn-schlabach"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/20834050/the-story-how-fbi-brought-words-corruption |title=The step-by-step process of how the words 'corruption' and 'fraud' came to college basketball |last=Schlabach|first=Mark |publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=September 27, 2017|accessdate=September 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nbcnews"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/college-basketball-coaches-allegedly-took-bribes-agents-deliver-athletes-n804781|title=4 NCAA Basketball Coaches, Adidas Executive Charged in Bribe Scheme|last1=Winter|first1=Tom|last2=Connor|first2=Tracy|publisher=[[NBC News]]|date=September 26, 2017 |accessdate=September 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sbnation"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sbnation.com/college-basketball/2017/9/27/16366056/college-basketball-scandal-corruption-fbi|title=The FBI's investigation of college basketball corruption, explained|last=Lyles |first=Harry Jr.|publisher=[[SB Nation]]|date=September 27, 2017|accessdate=September 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but now involving many programs not affiliated with Adidas.&lt;ref name="Yahoo 2-23"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/exclusive-federal-documents-detail-sweeping-potential-ncaa-violations-involving-high-profile-players-schools-103338484.html |title=Exclusive: Federal documents detail sweeping potential NCAA violations involving high-profile players, schools |first1=Pat |last1=Forde |first2=Pete |last2=Thamel |authorlink1=Pat Forde |publisher=[[Yahoo!

On September 27, 2017, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] and the office of the [[United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York]] announced the arrest of 10 individuals, including assistant coaches Anthony Bland, [[Chuck Person]], [[Emanuel Richardson]], and [[2017–18 Oklahoma State Cowboys basketball team|Lamont Evans]] and Adidas executive '''James Gatto''', on various corruption and [[fraud]] charges including [[bribery]], [[money laundering]], and [[wire fraud]].&lt;ref name="espn-schlabach"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nbcnews"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sbnation"/&gt; The schools implicated in the initial announcement were [[Arizona Wildcats men's basketball|Arizona]], [[Auburn Tigers men's basketball|Auburn]], [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Louisville]], [[Miami Hurricanes men's basketball|Miami]], [[Oklahoma State Cowboys men's basketball|Oklahoma State]], [[South Carolina Gamecocks men's basketball|South Carolina]], and [[USC Trojans men's basketball|Southern California]] (USC).&lt;ref name="espn-schlabach"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nbcnews"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sbnation"/&gt;

The investigation has since spread beyond the individuals and teams initially implicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/21710106/louisville-athletic-director-tom-jurich-leveraged-big-deals-build-university-sports-powerhouse-only-watch-burn-amid-charges-excess|title=How a midlevel school became The University of Adidas at Louisville |date=December 10, 2017|accessdate=December 19, 2017|website=ESPN.com|first1=Steve|last1=Fainaru|first2=Mark|last2=Fainaru-Wada}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, multiple media reports indicated that the Elite Youth Basketball League, the grassroots basketball division of [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], was served with a [[subpoena]] by federal investigators. While Nike was not named in the initial documents, one of the 10 individuals arrested on September 26 was a former Nike executive who was working for Adidas when he was arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/report-nike-grassroots-basketball-division-served-with-subpoena-by-federal-agents/ |title=Report: Nike grassroots basketball division served with subpoena by federal agents|first=Kyle|last=Boone|website=[[CBSSports.com]]|date=September 28, 2017|accessdate=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 23, 2018, [[Yahoo! Sports]] published a report, based on "hundreds of pages of documents" obtained by the FBI from two agents and an agency implicated in the investigation, that named more than a dozen additional schools and over 25 current and former players as having been potentially implicated in the scandal.&lt;ref name="Yahoo 2-23"/&gt; Still later, on April 10, Southern District prosecutors added extra criminal counts to the indictment of Gatto, with the added counts specifically naming [[Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball|Kansas]] and [[NC State Wolfpack men's basketball|North Carolina State]] as well as Louisville and Miami.&lt;ref name="Schlabach 4-10"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/23107028/prosecutors-add-more-criminal-counts-adidas-executive-fbi-college-basketball-probe |title=Adidas executive James Gatto handed more criminal counts in college basketball probe |first=Mark |last=Schlabach |website=ESPN.com |date=April 10, 2018 |accessdate=April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yahoo 4-10"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/new-federal-charges-college-basketball-scandal-allege-payments-steer-players-kansas-n-c-state-234400184.html |title=New federal charges in college basketball scandal allege payments to steer players to Kansas, N.C.

== Background ==
The discovery of corruption in basketball stemmed from an investigation of [[Pittsburgh]]-based financial planner Marty Blazer by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC). In 2016, the SEC charged Blazer with wire fraud and accused him of [[Embezzlement|embezzling]] over $2 million from several professional athletes to invest in movie projects and finance [[Ponzi scheme]]s. As part of a [[Plea bargaining|plea agreement]] with the Southern District U.S. Attorney's office, he agreed to become an FBI informant, and would later plead guilty to reduced charges.&lt;ref name="espn-schlabach"/&gt;

== Programs affected ==
=== First wave ===
==== Arizona ====
[[Emanuel Richardson|Emanuel "Book" Richardson]], an Arizona assistant since 2009, was among the individuals arrested and indicted in 2017. He was alleged to have met with agent Christian Dawkins and others in June 2017, agreeing to accept a $5,000 bribe to steer Arizona players to Dawkins' sports management company,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/sports/ncaab/ua/2017/11/08/arizona-wildcats-assistant-coach-book-richardson-indicted-charges-ncaa-fbi-bribery-investigation/844104001/ |title=Arizona assistant coach Book Richardson indicted on charges tied to NCAA bribery investigation |first=Anne |last=Ryman |newspaper=[[The Arizona Republic]] |location=[[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] |date=November 8, 2017 |accessdate=February 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was also charged with accepting an additional $15,000 in bribes and paying at least one recruit to commit to the university.&lt;ref name=Schmidt&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tucson.com/sports/arizonawildcats/basketball/ua-fires-assistant-basketball-coach-book-richardson-after-his-appeal/article_d22368ae-005e-11e8-9c31-4bdff6aac439.html |title=UA fires assistant basketball coach Book Richardson after his appeal fails |first=Caitlin |last=Schmidt |newspaper=[[Arizona Daily Star]] |location=[[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson, AZ]] |date=January 23, 2018 |accessdate=February 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richardson was suspended on September 26, the day after his arrest, and formally fired on January 23, 2018.&lt;ref name=Schmidt/&gt;

Arizona lost one of its three-member 2018 recruiting class in the wake of the initial allegations. Five-star point guard [[Jahvon Quinerly]] reopened his recruitment in October, and eventually signed with [[Villanova Wildcats men's basketball|Villanova]].&lt;ref name="Williams decommit"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/college-sports/recruiting/basketball/mens/story/_/id/22626040/class-2018-espn-100-point-guard-brandon-williams-decommits-arizona-wildcats |title=PG Brandon Williams becomes third player to decommit from Arizona |first=Jeff |last=Borzello |website=ESPN.com |date=March 2, 2018 |accessdate=March 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nassir Little]], also a Five-star recruit, cited the investigation as his reason for deciding against attending Arizona.&lt;ref name="Nassir Little picks UNC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/20916374/five-star-prospect-nassir-little-commits-north-carolina-tar-heels |title=PG Brandon Nassir Little picks UNC |first=Jeff |last=Borzello |website=ESPN.com |date=October 5, 2018 |accessdate=October 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a wiretap that was played during the trial Merl Code claims that Arizona offered $150,000 for Little.&lt;ref name="College Basketball Corruption Trial"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/college-basketball-corruption-trial-payments-for-kansas-players-and-to-ex-nc-state-assistant-detailed-by-witness/ |title=College Basketball Corruption Trial |first=Matt |last=Norlander |website=CBSSports.com |date=October 11, 2018 |accessdate=October 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Auburn ====
[[Chuck Person]], a former Auburn basketball star who went on to a long [[National Basketball Association]] career before going into coaching, was alleged by the FBI to have received over $90,000 in bribes from Rashan Michel, a former NBA and [[Southeastern Conference]] referee who ran a custom tailoring shop in [[Atlanta]] that had many professional athletes as clients. Person was accused of paying nearly $20,000 to the families of two Auburn recruits.&lt;ref name="espn-schlabach"/&gt; Auburn suspended Person without pay shortly after his arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/ncaa-basketball/news/chuck-person-auburn-basketball-suspended-ncaa-corruption-charges-adidas-recruits/1q3lk3eomafni1d1v1xxoe1ris |title=Auburn suspends Chuck Person without pay following arrest |first=Zac |last=Al-Khateeb |publisher=''[[Sporting News]]'' |date=September 26, 2017 |accessdate=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Person was indicted by a federal grand jury and subsequently fired by Auburn on November 7, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/auburn/2017/11/07/auburn-suspended-assistant-chuck-person-indicted-federal-grand-jury/842479001/|title=Chuck Person indicted by federal grand jury, fired by Auburn|work=USA TODAY|access-date=November 8, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of the indictments, the university retained an outside law firm to launch an internal investigation into the program.&lt;ref name="Pearl issues"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/21342267/bruce-pearl-job-jeopardy-cooperate-auburn-internal-investigation |title=Sources: Bruce Pearl's job in jeopardy if he doesn't cooperate in Auburn investigation |first1=Mark |last1=Schlabach |first2=Paula |last2=Lavigne |authorlink1=Mark Schlabach |publisher=''[[ESPN.com]]'' |date=November 8, 2017 |accessdate=November 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Auburn's exhibition game on November 2, 2017, the school announced that it would hold players [[Austin Wiley]] and Danjel Purifoy out of games indefinitely due to eligibility concerns raised over the FBI investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/auburn-holds-out-f-danjel-purifoy-and-c-austin-wiley-indefinitely-amid-fbi-investigation/|title=Auburn holding out Danjel Purifoy and Austin Wiley indefinitely amid FBI probe|work=CBSSports.com|access-date=November 2, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They would both be held out of commission throughout the rest of the season, though they returned to playing again after the conclusion of that season.

On November 8, ESPN reported that head coach [[Bruce Pearl]] was refusing to cooperate with the school's internal investigation, and that university officials notified him that his refusal could lead to his firing. The university had been unable to determine whether Pearl had been involved in any violations of law or [[NCAA]] rules because the FBI had seized his computers and cell phones as part of its investigation.&lt;ref name="Pearl issues"/&gt;

On the same day that the initial arrests were announced, E. J. Montgomery, a highly-touted forward in the 2018 recruiting class who had verbally committed to Auburn in September 2016, announced he would reopen his recruitment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.espn.com/college-sports/recruiting/basketball/mens/story/_/id/20835897/auburn-tigers-recruit-ej-montgomery-decommits |title=ESPN 100 recruit E.J. Montgomery decommits from Auburn |first=Jeff |last=Borzello |website=ESPN.com |date=September 27, 2017 |accessdate=April 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Montgomery would ultimately commit to [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky]] in April 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/23088894/ej-montgomery-latest-5-star-recruit-commit-kentucky-wildcats |title=E.J.

==== Louisville ====
Louisville was not named directly in the court documents, but the documents mentioned a "University-6" that was "a public research university located in Kentucky" with "approximately 22,640 students and over 7,000 faculty and staff members", and fielding "approximately 21 varsity sports teams in NCAA Division I competition."&lt;ref name=ODonnell&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sbnation.com/college-basketball/2017/9/26/16367526/louisville-fbi-investigation-college-basketball-scandal-rick-pitino |title=Louisville basketball has an FBI investigation to worry about while still on NCAA probation |first=Ricky |last=O'Donnell |website=[[SB Nation]] |date=September 26, 2017 |accessdate=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state has only two public research universities—the [[University of Kentucky]] and the [[University of Louisville]]—and the details cited in the documents match only Louisville. Gregory Postel, Louisville's interim president, confirmed hours after the FBI announcements that the school was indeed "University-6".&lt;ref name=Novelly&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/2017/09/26/university-louisville-college-basketball-fbi-sting/703414001/ |title=University of Louisville college basketball program targeted in FBI investigation |first=Thomas |last=Novelly |newspaper=[[The Courier-Journal|Courier Journal]] |location=[[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville, KY]] |date=September 26, 2017 |accessdate=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the announcement, the Louisville men's basketball program was facing major NCAA sanctions stemming from an [[2015 University of Louisville basketball sex scandal|earlier sex scandal]], which included vacating the 2013 national championship.&lt;ref name=ODonnell/&gt; The NCAA upheld those sanctions on February 20, 2018.

The documents also alluded to two Louisville coaches, identified only as "Coach-1" and "Coach-2", and a recruit who [[National Letter of Intent|signed]] with Louisville identified as "Player-10".&lt;ref name="Gatto complaint U6"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/press-release/file/999006/download |title=Complaint, ''United States v. James Gatto et al.'' |publisher=[[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]] |pages=20–22 |accessdate=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documents allege that the coaches were involved in a scheme by which a "Company-1", later identified as Adidas, would funnel $100,000 to the family of "Player-10" in exchange for him coming to Louisville. About a month before the scandal broke, Louisville, which has been Adidas' flagship college athletic program since 2016, signed a 10-year, $160 million extension to its then-current apparel contract with the company.&lt;ref name="espn-schlabach"/&gt; The documents indicate that Brad Augustine, a youth basketball coach in Florida who was among the individuals arrested, said the following about "Coach-2":&lt;ref name="Parrish Coach-2"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/rick-pitino-identified-as-coach-2-mentioned-in-federal-court-documents/ |title=Rick Pitino identified as ‘Coach-2’ mentioned in federal court documents |first=Gary |last=Parrish |publisher=''CBSSports.com'' |date=September 28, 2017 |accessdate=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;No one swings a bigger dick than Coach-2 at Company-1. . . . All [Coach-2] has to do is pick up the phone and call somebody [and say], 'These are my guys.' [And then] they're taking care of us.&lt;ref name="Gatto complaint U6"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The day after the complaints were unsealed, [[CBS News]], followed by many other media outlets, reported that "Coach-2" was Louisville head coach [[Rick Pitino]].&lt;ref name="Parrish Coach-2"/&gt; Shortly thereafter, media outlets identified "Player-10" as [[Brian Bowen]], a top recruit who had unexpectedly signed with Louisville on June 3, 2017.&lt;ref name="Parrish Coach-2"/&gt;

As a result of the scandal, on September 27, 2017, Louisville placed Pitino on unpaid [[administrative leave]] and [[athletic director]] [[Tom Jurich]] on paid administrative leave.&lt;ref name="espn-pitino-jurich"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/20834710/louisville-head-coach-rick-pitino-athletic-director-tom-jurich-put-leave|title=Louisville's Rick Pitino and Tom Jurich placed on administrative leave|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=September 27, 2017|accessdate=September 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bowen was suspended from the team and withheld from all team activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/ncaa-basketball/news/louisville-federal-charges-brian-bowen-suspension-cardinal-mens-basketball-rick-pitino/bl37wotnowv015u09k2hxk4ex |title=Brian Bowen, Louisville player implicated in indictment, reportedly suspended indefinitely |first=Skylar |last=Rolstad |publisher=''Sporting News'' |date=September 28, 2017 |accessdate=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, two five-star high school recruits who had verbally committed to join the Louisville program in 2018–19, Anfernee Simons and Courtney Ramey, rescinded their commitments and reopened their recruitment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/college-basketball/2017/09/27/louisville-recruiting-anfernee-simons-courtney-ramey |title=With Rick Pitino Out of the Picture, Louisville Loses Two Five-Stars from 2018 Recruiting Class |first=Chris |last=Johnson |publisher=''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' |date=September 27, 2017 |accessdate=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simons would try his luck with entering the [[2018 NBA Draft]] as a high school postgraduate. The Cardinals lost a third recruit on October 4 when David Johnson, a guard from the local [[Trinity High School (Louisville)|Trinity High School]] who was rated as a top-50 prospect in the recruiting class of 2019 and had verbally committed to Louisville, rescinded his commitment (Johnson would re-commit to Louisville a year later.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cardchronicle.com/2018/9/22/17890580/trinity-guard-david-johnson-commits-to-louisville |title=Trinity Guard David Johnson Commits to Louisville |first=Keith |last=Wynne |date=September 22, 2018 |accessdate= November 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two other five-star prospects for 2018 who had placed Louisville within their final choices, [[Moses Brown (basketball)|Moses Brown]] and [[Romeo Langford]] removed the Cardinals from their lists in the wake of the scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.kentucky.com/sports/college/acc/university-of-louisville/article176937816.html |title=Louisville basketball recruiting takes another hit, and it’ll be a long road to recovery |first=Ben |last=Roberts |newspaper=[[Lexington Herald-Leader]] |location=[[Lexington, Kentucky]] |date=October 4, 2017 |accessdate=October 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 6 the University of Louisville placed associate head coach Kenny Johnson and assistant coach Jordan Fair on paid administrative leave, and Fair would be fired by Louisville on October 11.

The Louisville athletics board officially voted to fire Pitino on October 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.si.com/college-basketball/2017/10/16/louisville-rick-pitino-fired |title= Louisville Head Coach Rick Pitino Officially Fired  |first=Scooby |last=Axson |publisher=''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' |date=October 16, 2017 |accessdate=October 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, the university's board of trustees voted 10–3 to fire Jurich with cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/college-sports/story/_/id/21068230/louisville-cardinals-fire-athletic-director-tom-jurich |title=Louisville fires athletic director Tom Jurich after scandal |first=Andrea |last=Adelson |publisher=''ESPN.com'' |date=October 18, 2017 |accessdate=October 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 8, the Southern District unsealed a new set of indictments against eight of the 10 individuals initially charged. On the same day, [[NBC News]] reported that these new documents directly linked Pitino to the alleged scheme to pay Bowen's family. The documents allege that Pitino met in July 2017 with Christian Dawkins, an agent who was formally indicted in both September and November. During that meeting, Dawkins was said to have asked Pitino to call Gatto and request the $100,000 payment to Bowen's family, and Pitino reportedly agreed to make the call to Gatto. The FBI revealed that phone records indicated that Pitino called Gatto three times before Bowen committed to Louisville.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/sports/federal-bribery-indictments-unsealed-against-ncaa-coaches-n819156 |title=Federal Bribery Indictments Unsealed Against NCAA Coaches |first1=Tom |last1=Winter |first2=Phil |last2=McCasland |publisher=NBC News |date=November 8, 2017 |accessdate=November 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The April 2018 indictments specifically charge Dawkins and Adidas consultant Merl Code with conspiring with Gatto to commit wire fraud and pay the aforementioned $100,000 to Bowen's family.&lt;ref name="Schlabach 4-10"/&gt;

==== Miami ====
Like Louisville, the [[University of Miami]] was not directly identified in the court documents, but UM president [[Julio Frenk]] confirmed on September 27 that the school was the institution described in said documents as "University-7". The confirmation came the day after the attorney for UM head coach [[Jim Larrañaga]] said that the coach was unaware of any impropriety in the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-hurricanes/fl-sp-miami-hurricanes-fbi-basketball-20170927-story.html |title=UM acknowledges probe; Larrañaga denies knowing identity of 'Coach-3' |first=Christy |last=Cabrera Chirinos |newspaper=[[Sun-Sentinel]] |location=[[Deerfield Beach, Florida|Deerfield Beach, FL]] |date=September 27, 2017 |accessdate=October 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documents allege that a UM coach identified only as "Coach-3" requested that Gatto arrange a $150,000 payment from Adidas to the family of a top high school player identified as "Player-12" in an attempt to keep him from signing with a "University-4" that was sponsored by a rival apparel company.&lt;ref name="Gatto complaint U7"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/press-release/file/999006/download |title=Complaint, ''United States v.

==== Oklahoma State and South Carolina ====
Lamont Evans, at the time an assistant at Oklahoma State, was one of the four coaches arrested on September 26. He was accused of taking at least $22,000 in bribes from two financial advisors, one of whom was acting as an FBI informant. The alleged bribes were offered over a five-year period that included Evans' former tenure as an assistant at South Carolina. Oklahoma State fired Evans on September 28.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/oklahoma-state-fires-associate-head-coach-lamont-evans-amid-fbi-investigation/ |title=Oklahoma State fires associate head coach Lamont Evans amid FBI investigation |first=Kyle |last=Boone |publisher=''CBSSports.com'' |date=September 28, 2017 |accessdate=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oklahoma State lost one potential recruit due to the scandal. On the same day Evans was fired, Antwann Jones, a guard ranked by ESPN as one of the top 50 players in the recruiting class of 2018, rescinded a verbal commitment he had made to the program less than two weeks earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/recruiting/story/_/id/20853831/antwann-jones-no-45-prospect-espn-100-decommits-oklahoma-state |title=Antwann Jones, No. 45 in ESPN 100, decommits from Oklahoma St. |first=Jeff |last=Borzello |publisher=''ESPN.com'' |date=September 28, 2017 |accessdate=October 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Alabama ====
In the aftermath of the announcement of the FBI investigation, [[Alabama Crimson Tide men's basketball|Alabama]] director of basketball operations Kobie Baker resigned following an internal investigation into the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/alabama-basketball-administrator-resigns-amid-020013932.html|title=Alabama Basketball Administrator Kobie Baker Resigns Amid FBI Investigation|access-date=November 7, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resignation came after the school uncovered that Baker had accepted bribes to steer one of Alabama's incoming freshman players toward financial advisor Rashan Michel. Baker allegedly accepted a $5,000 payment for arranging a meeting between Michel and the father of the player, and an additional $10,000 for helping to steer the player toward Michel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tidesports.com/kobie-baker-resignation-fbi-investigation/|title=Kobie Baker resignation tied to FBI investigation {{!}} TideSports.com|date=September 27, 2017 |work=TideSports.com |access-date=November 7, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Alabama's exhibition game on November 6, 2017, the school announced that freshman point guard [[Collin Sexton]] would not play that game due to eligibility concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/sec/2017/11/06/alabama-freshman-point-guard-collin-sexton-not-eligible-ncaa-exhibition/838454001/|title=Alabama freshman point guard Collin Sexton not eligible, missed exhibition game|work=USA TODAY|access-date=November 7, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexton would later be cleared to play for Alabama starting with their November 14 game against [[2017–18 Lipscomb Bisons men's basketball team|Lipscomb]].

==== USC ====
On September 26, federal prosecutors in New York announced charges of fraud and corruption against USC assistant coach Tony Bland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/20824193/ncaa-basketball-coaches-10-charged-fraud-corruption|title=NCAA coaches among 10 arrested for corruption|work=ESPN.com|access-date=September 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charges allege that Bland and others allegedly received benefits from financial advisers and others to influence student-athletes to retain their services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2017/09/26/college-basketball-assistants-arrested-fbi-fraud-corruption-scheme/703295001/|title=FBI arrests four college basketball assistants on charges of fraud|work=USA TODAY|access-date=September 26, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the announcement, USC placed Bland on administrative leave and announced that it would conduct an internal investigation of the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://collegebasketball.nbcsports.com/2017/09/26/usc-hires-former-fbi-director-freeh-tony-bland-placed-on-leave/|title=USC hires former FBI director Freeh, Tony Bland placed on leave|date=September 26, 2017 |work=CollegeBasketballTalk|access-date=September 26, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; After playing in only a few games in the 2017-18 season, on January 15, 2018, sophomore point guard [[De'Anthony Melton]] was indefinitely suspended as a result of the investigation. Melton would later remove himself from the university on February 21, 2018, in order to enter the [[2018 NBA Draft]] and begin training for it early, where he was selected 46th by the [[Houston Rockets]] and was later traded to the [[Phoenix Suns]] on August 31 before the upcoming NBA season began.

=== Second wave ===
==== Arizona ====
On February 23, 2018, FBI wiretaps reportedly showed that head coach [[Sean Miller]] had discussed with Dawkins about paying [[Deandre Ayton]] $100,000 to facilitate Ayton's commitment to the [[University of Arizona]], with the monetary situation being dealt with directly to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/22559284/sean-miller-arizona-christian-dawkins-discussed-payment-ensure-deandre-ayton-signing-according-fbi-investigation |title=FBI wiretaps show Sean Miller discussed $100K payment to lock recruit |last=Schlabach |first=Mark |date=February 23, 2018 |website=www.espn.com |publisher=ESPN |access-date=February 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; If he were implicated in this case, it would have potentially hurt Ayton's chances of finishing out the rest of his season with Arizona, as well as result in him entering the [[2018 NBA draft]] earlier than anticipated, similar to that of [[De'Anthony Melton]]&lt;!--his future teammate with the Phoenix Suns in their rookie seasons together--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.azdesertswarm.com/basketball/2018/2/23/17047208/arizona-basketball-sean-miller-discussed-paying-100000-ensure-signing-deandre-ayton-espn-fbi-fire |title=Sean Miller discussed paying $100,000 to ensure signing of Deandre Ayton, per ESPN |last=Kelapire |first=Ryan |date=February 23, 2018 |website=www.azdesertswarm.com |publisher=[[Vox Media, Inc.]] |access-date=February 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, Miller notified the team that he would not coach in that night's game against [[2017–18 Oregon Ducks men's basketball team|Oregon]], with associate coach [[Lorenzo Romar]] coaching the team instead and Ayton being allowed to play for Arizona that game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/22567552/sean-miller-coach-arizona-wildcats-saturday-oregon-ducks |title=Sean Miller won't coach Arizona's game Saturday vs. Oregon|date=February 24, 2018 |website=www.espn.com |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=February 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ayton and his family have maintained they did not earn any monetary benefits to attend Arizona, with further information suggesting that Miller's calls to Dawkins were related to the recruitment of another player instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://247sports.com/Article/Sources-Conflicting-information-in-ESPNs-report-involving-Arizona-star-DeAndre-Ayton-coach-Sean-Miller-115594868|title=Sources: Conflicting information in ESPN's report involving Arizona star DeAndre Ayton, coach Sean Miller|publisher=|accessdate=March 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ultimately led to Ayton being cleared to finish out the season with Arizona. On March 1, Miller made his first public comments since the reporting on the wiretaps, in which he unequivocally denied any involvement in payments to players. ESPN reported that Miller would coach the team that night against [[2017–18 Stanford Cardinal men's basketball team|Stanford]], with Miller confirmed to remain the coach for Arizona throughout the rest of this season, as well as a bit further beyond that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/22616244/sean-miller-arizona-wildcats-coach-denies-report-discussed-paying-recruit |title=Arizona's Sean Miller denies report he discussed paying recruit |website=ESPN.com |date=March 1, 2018 |accessdate=March 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arizona, which had already lost one of its three-member 2018 recruiting class after the initial allegations, initially lost its remaining two 2018 recruits after the new revelations. Power forward [[Shareef O'Neal]], son of [[List of players in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] player [[Shaquille O'Neal]] and rated as a top-30 prospect, announced on February 24 that he was rescinding a commitment he had made in April 2017 to play at Arizona. Because the younger O'Neal signed a nonbinding financial aid agreement instead of a formal letter of intent, he did not need a release from Arizona to choose a new destination,&lt;ref name="O'Neal decommit"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/22567755/shareef-oneal-decommits-arizona-wildcats-amid-fbi-probe |title=Arizona commit Shareef O'Neal, Shaquille's son, opens recruitment amid probe |first=Jeff |last=Borzello |website=ESPN.com |date=February 24, 2018 |accessdate=February 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he would commit to [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]] three days later.&lt;ref name="Williams decommit"/&gt; Arizona's only remaining recruit at the time in the 2018 class, point guard Brandon Williams, also did not sign a letter of intent, giving him the option to reopen his recruitment, and he chose to do so on March 2.&lt;ref name="Williams decommit"/&gt; However, unlike Shareef O'Neal, Williams decided to recommit to Arizona on May 5, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arizonasports.com/story/1139527/four-star-recruit-brandon-williams-recommits-to-arizona/|title=Four-star PG recruit Brandon Williams recommits to Arizona|date=May 5, 2018|publisher=|accessdate=June 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== NC State ====
According to the documents viewed by Yahoo! Sports, former [[NC State Wolfpack men's basketball|NC State]] and current NBA player [[Dennis Smith Jr.]] had received $43,500 from ASM Sports, an agency run by reported cooperating government witness Andy Miller, before enrolling at the school. Another document said that Smith had received over $70,000 in loans, with the document also including notes about "how to recoup the money" after Smith chose not to sign with ASM Sports.&lt;ref name="Yahoo 2-23"/&gt;

The April 2018 indictments specifically charge that Gatto was involved in a scheme to funnel $40,000 to Smith's family in October 2015 in exchange for signing with NC State. Adidas had a well-established relationship with both Smith and NC State, as Smith was playing for an Adidas-sponsored [[Amateur Athletic Union|AAU]] team at the time, and NC State was then (as now) an Adidas-backed program. The indictment also claimed that an NC State coach identified only as "Coach-4" was the conduit for this payment. Smith would sign a financial aid agreement with the school in December of that year.&lt;ref name="Yahoo 4-10"/&gt;

==== Seton Hall ====
The ASM documents also claim that current NBA player [[Isaiah Whitehead]] received at least $26,000 from ASM while at [[Seton Hall Pirates men's basketball|Seton Hall]]. He signed with ASM after leaving for the [[2017 NBA draft]], but later moved to [[Roc Nation]].&lt;ref name="Yahoo 2-23"/&gt;

==== LSU ====
Former [[LSU Tigers basketball|LSU]] player [[Tim Quarterman]] allegedly received at least $16,000 from ASM while at the school.&lt;ref name="Yahoo 2-23"/&gt;

==== Maryland ====
[[Diamond Stone]], who played at [[Maryland Terrapins men's basketball|Maryland]] in the 2015–16 season, allegedly received over $14,000 from ASM.&lt;ref name="Yahoo 2-23"/&gt; The school launched an internal investigation into possible ties with the scandal, with head coach [[Mark Turgeon]] denying that he or any of his staff members had any involvement with the agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/22567629/maryland-basketball-conducting-internal-review-fbi-probe |title=Maryland will conduct internal review amid FBI investigation |first=Jamison |last=Hensley |website=ESPN.com |date=February 24, 2018 |accessdate=February 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The April 2018 indictments peripherally linked Maryland and its current apparel provider, [[Under Armour]], to the scandal in a completely separate context, although neither was explicitly named in those documents. The FBI alleged that Gatto and a co-conspirator identified in the documents as "CC-3" agreed to make payments to the guardian of a 2017 recruit who was identified by media as [[Silvio De Sousa]]. According to the documents, the guardian told "CC-3" that he had received illicit payments from individuals connected with Under Armour in exchange for De Sousa's commitment to Maryland. The guardian also indicated that De Sousa preferred to go to Kansas, but that he would need to repay the illicit payments to facilitate the player's wishes. Gatto and "CC-3" then allegedly paid the guardian $20,000. De Sousa, who had been considered by most recruiting experts as a virtual lock to attend Maryland, committed to Kansas on August 30, 2017. It should also be noted that shortly after the 2018 indictments were unsealed, De Sousa's guardian denied accepting any illicit payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/how-maryland-under-armour-were-roped-into-fbi-investigation-of-kansas-recruit/ |title=How Maryland, Under Armour were roped into FBI investigation of Kansas recruit |first=Matt |last=Norlander |website=CBSSports.com |date=April 11, 2018 |accessdate=April 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yahoo 4-10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schlabach 4-10"/&gt;

==== Kentucky ====
A spreadsheet in the documents viewed by Yahoo! Sports listed a $12,000 payment to a prospect identified as "BAM". A later note in the document identifies this individual as [[Bam Adebayo]], who played only one season at [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky]] in 2016–17. Other documents claim that Adebayo received $36,500 in loans. Additionally, then-current Wildcats player [[Kevin Knox (basketball)|Kevin Knox]] was listed among several players who had met or dined with Dawkins, or whose families had done so.&lt;ref name="Yahoo 2-23"/&gt;

==== Washington ====
[[Markelle Fultz]], who played a season at [[Washington Huskies men's basketball|Washington]] before leaving to become the top pick in the [[2017 NBA draft]], allegedly received $10,000 from ASM.&lt;ref name="Yahoo 2-23"/&gt;

==== USC ====
Melton would ultimately not be the only USC player implicated. The ASM documents claim that two other current USC players, or individuals closely associated with them, had received payments from the company.&lt;ref name="Yahoo 2-23"/&gt;

==== Utah ====
[[Kyle Kuzma]], a 2017 first-round NBA draft pick, was listed in the ASM documents as having received $9,500 from the agency while at [[Utah Utes men's basketball|Utah]].&lt;ref name="Yahoo 2-23"/&gt;

==== Xavier ====
Former [[Xavier Musketeers men's basketball|Xavier]] star [[Edmond Sumner]] and his father reportedly received at least $7,000 in advances from ASM during the younger Sumner's college career.&lt;ref name="Yahoo 2-23"/&gt;

==== South Carolina ====
After being withheld from play by Louisville amid questions regarding his eligibility stemming from the original revelations, [[Brian Bowen]] withdrew from the school and eventually enrolled at South Carolina, though he would not be eligible to play for the Gamecocks' basketball program until January 2019. However, the ASM documents raise more questions about his NCAA eligibility, allegedly listing at least $7,000 in benefits to him and his family during his high school career. That would result in him later rescinding his collegiate entry altogether, instead opting to begin a professional basketball career early, starting with the [[Sydney Kings]] in Australia. In addition, [[P. J. Dozier]], a star on South Carolina's [[2017 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|2017]] [[2016–17 South Carolina Gamecocks men's basketball team|Final Four team]], was alleged to have received over $6,000 while at the school.&lt;ref name="Yahoo 2-23"/&gt;

==== Kansas ====
The mother of former [[Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball|Kansas]] (KU) star [[Josh Jackson (basketball)|Josh Jackson]], Apples Jones, reportedly received $2,700 from ASM during Jackson's college career.&lt;ref name="Yahoo 2-23"/&gt;

The April 2018 indictments raised more serious issues surrounding the Kansas program, which is also sponsored by Adidas. Gatto and the coach of an Adidas-sponsored AAU team were alleged to have given at least $90,000 to the mother of a KU recruit between October 2016 and November 2017 in exchange for the player's commitment to the school.&lt;ref name="Yahoo 4-10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schlabach 4-10"/&gt; Sources close to the investigation told Yahoo! Sports that this player was [[Billy Preston (basketball)|Billy Preston]], who committed to KU in November 2016 and enrolled at the school in 2017. He played in two exhibition games, but the school did not allow him to play during the beginning [[2017–18 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|2017–18 season]] and then left school after questions were raised about his ownership of a car which he was driving at the time of an auto accident.&lt;ref name="Yahoo 4-12"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.yahoo.com/sports/new-charges-college-hoops-corruption-case-mean-182225446.html |title=What do new charges in college hoops corruption case mean? |first1=Pat |last1=Forde |first2=Pete |last2=Thamel |first3=Dan |last3=Wetzel |publisher=Yahoo! Sports |date=April 12, 2018 |accessdate=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another member of KU's 2017 recruiting class, Silvio De Sousa, was linked to illicit payments in the 2018 indictments. He also was held out of the beginng 2017–18 season while the school worked with the NCAA to determine his eligibility. In January the NCAA declared him eligible and he became a key reserve during the Jayhawks' Final Four run.&lt;ref name="Yahoo 4-12"/&gt;

==== Texas ====
Then-current [[Texas Longhorns men's basketball|Texas]] player Eric Davis Jr. allegedly received $1,500 from ASM.&lt;ref name="Yahoo 2-23"/&gt; Texas held him out of the team's February 24 game against [[2017–18 Oklahoma State Cowboys basketball team|Oklahoma State]].&lt;ref name="Davis, Pope"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/22557156/texas-longhorns-san-diego-state-aztecs-keep-players-games-amid-inquiry-allegations |title=Texas' Eric Davis Jr., San Diego State's Malik Pope shelved during inquiry into allegations |first=Jeff |last=Borzello |website=ESPN.com |date=February 24, 2018 |accessdate=February 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, former Longhorns player Prince Ibeh was found in Dawkins' list of players and/or families who had met with or dined with Dawkins while in high school or college.&lt;ref name="Yahoo 2-23"/&gt;

==== San Diego State ====
Then-current [[San Diego State Aztecs men's basketball|San Diego State]] player [[Malik Pope]] allegedly received $1,400 from ASM. Pope was withheld from the team's February 24 game against [[2017–18 San Jose State Spartans men's basketball team|San Jose State]]&lt;ref name="Davis, Pope"/&gt; while the school launched an internal investigation into the allegations. San Diego State cleared Pope to play prior to the Aztecs' February 27 game against [[2017–18 Boise State Broncos men's basketball team|Boise State]], determining that there was no credible evidence that Pope had received any impermissible benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/22598634/malik-pope-san-diego-state-cleared-play-name-appeared-fbi-corruption-investigation |title=San Diego State: No evidence Malik Pope got impermissible benefits |agency=Associated Press |website=ESPN.com |date=February 28, 2018 |accessdate=February 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Clemson ====
Former [[Clemson Tigers men's basketball|Clemson]] star [[Jaron Blossomgame]] reportedly received a payment of $1,100 while at the school.&lt;ref name="Yahoo 2-23"/&gt;

==== Wichita State ====
The ASM documents allege that former [[Wichita State Shockers men's basketball|Wichita State]] star [[Fred VanVleet]] received at least $1,000 while playing for the school.&lt;ref name="Yahoo 2-23"/&gt;

==== Michigan State ====
The mother of then-current [[Michigan State Spartans men's basketball|Michigan State]] star [[Miles Bridges]] reportedly received several hundred dollars in advances from ASM.&lt;ref name="Yahoo 2-23"/&gt; An internal Michigan State investigation found that allegations that Bridges' mother had received about $400 in cash from Dawkins were false, but confirmed that Dawkins had paid slightly over $70 for a dinner with Bridges family members (though without the player present). Bridges was temporarily ruled ineligible because of the dinner, but his eligibility was restored on February 24, just in time to play for the Spartans' regular season finale at Wisconsin. Bridges made a $40 contribution (the approximate value of his family members' meals at the Dawkins meeting) to a charity of his choice as part of the reinstatement process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/22589989/michigan-state-miles-bridges-donates-40-charity-resolve-ncaa-violation |title=Miles Bridges donates $40 to charity to resolve NCAA violation |website=ESPN.com |date=February 26, 2018 |accessdate=February 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Other players potentially implicated ====
The ASM documents also indicated that several players, or their family members, had either met or dined with Dawkins while the players were in high school or college. According to a lawyer involved with NCAA compliance issues who was interviewed in the Yahoo! Sports report, merely meeting with an agent is not an NCAA violation, but if the agent pays for a player's or family member's meal, the meal can be considered an "extra benefit" under NCAA rules. In addition to the aforementioned Knox and Ibeh, the following then-current and former NCAA players were listed in the ASM documents in this context:&lt;ref name="Yahoo 2-23"/&gt;
* Current players (at the time of the revelations):
** [[Wendell Carter]], [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]]
** [[Collin Sexton]], Alabama
* Former players:
** [[Wade Baldwin IV|Wade Baldwin]], [[Vanderbilt Commodores men's basketball|Vanderbilt]]
** [[Tony Bradley (basketball)|Tony Bradley]], [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]]
** [[Malcolm Brogdon]], [[Virginia Cavaliers men's basketball|Virginia]]
** [[Demetrius Jackson]], [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's basketball|Notre Dame]]
** [[Monte Morris]], [[Iowa State Cyclones men's basketball|Iowa State]]
** [[Justin Patton]], [[Creighton Bluejays men's basketball|Creighton]]

An '''A-list''' celebrity is one at the very top of their field. It may be a [[bankable star|bankable]] movie star, a major recording artist, international sports star, social media personality, film director, mogul, or an international TV broadcaster.

The A-list is part of a larger guide called ''The Hot List'' that has become an industry-standard guide in Hollywood. [[James Ulmer (journalist)|James Ulmer]], the creater of ''The Hot List'', has also developed a ''Hot List of Directors''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ulmerscale.com/aboutUS.html |title=About The Ulmer Scale |publisher=The Ulmer Scale}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ulmer scale categorizes the lists into A+, A, B+, B, C, and D listings.

==Popular usage==
In popular usage outside the film industry, an "A-list celebrity" is any person with an admired or desirable social status.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ask.com/reference/dictionary/ahdict/176077/a+list American Heritage Dictionary]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013214727/http://www.ask.com/reference/dictionary/ahdict/176077/a%2Blist |date=October 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even [[socialite]]s with popular press coverage and elite associations have been termed as "A-list" celebrities. Similarly, less popular persons and current teen idols are referred to as "B-list" – and the ones with lesser fame "C-list".&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1481579897/B_list.html Encarta]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5kvWN22tz?url=http://uk.encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1481579897/B_list.html |date=2009-10-31 }}, [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/B-list Webster's New Millennium Dictionary]. [https://www.webcitation.org/5kvWN22tz?url=http://uk.encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1481579897/B_list.html Archived] October 31, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' interpreted C-list celebrity as "that guy (or sometimes that girl), the easy-to-remember but hard-to-name [[character actor]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Erin |last=Podolsky |title=C-list celebrities – Three sites with information on 'that one guy' you see in movies from time to time |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,278510,00.html |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=November 10, 2000 |accessdate=April 14, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425112407/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C278510%2C00.html |archivedate=April 25, 2009 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"D-list" (or sometimes Z-list) is for a person whose celebrity is so obscure that they are generally only known for appearances as so-called celebrities on [[Panel show|panel game show]]s and [[reality television]]. In the late 20th century, D-listers were largely ignored by the entertainment news industry; for example, [[Paul Lynde]], by this point in his career best known for being on the daytime game show ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'', went largely unnoticed by the [[Tabloid journalism#Supermarket tabloids|supermarket tabloid]]s, and his homosexuality (which would have drawn scandal for bigger celebrities) went largely unreported.&lt;ref name="biography.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/news/tv-stars-of-the-1970s|title=TV Stars Who Ruled the 70s|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kathy Griffin]], a U.S. comedian who became widely known for her frequent appearances on such programs, used the term in a tongue-in-cheek manner for her 2005 TV special ''[[The D-List]]'' and her 2005 TV series ''[[Kathy Griffin: My Life on the D-List]]''. It is also the lowest rating used by U.S. journalist [[James Ulmer (journalist)|James Ulmer]] for his Ulmer Scale which ranks the bankability of 1,400 movie actors worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ulmerscale.com/aboutHL.html Ulmer Scale Hot List] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111214005830/http://www.ulmerscale.com/aboutHL.html |date=December 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other successive letters of the alphabet beyond D, such as "E-list" or "Z-list", are sometimes used for exaggeration or comic effect but effectively have the same meaning as D-list;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blalock|first1=Meghan|title=The 50 Most Infamous D-List Celebrities of All Time|url=http://stylecaster.com/d-list-celebrities/|website=stylecaster.com|publisher=stylecaster.com|accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the extent that there is a difference, letters further down the alphabet would indicate decreasing levels of fame (for example, regional celebrities such as [[local news]] anchors, [[community theatre]] actors, or at the bottom of the chain, common persons with no claim to fame whatsoever).

In the ''[[Kim Kardashian: Hollywood]]'' game, the player's goal is to increase their fame and reputation, starting on the E-list and rising to the A-list.&lt;ref&gt;http://time.com/3612615/influential-characters-2014/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Agritech''' is the use of [[technology]] in [[agriculture]], [[horticulture]], and [[aquaculture]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.sproutagritech.com/what-is-agritech/ | title=What is Agritech? | work=Sprout | accessdate=11 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the aim of improving yield, efficiency, and profitability. Agritech can be products, services or applications derived from agriculture that improve various input/output processes.

==History==
A major turning point for agricultural technology is the [[Industrial Revolution]].

==Types of agritech==

Technologies and applications in agri-tech include:

Drones
satellite photography and sensors
IoT-based sensor networks
phase tracking
weather forecasts
automated irrigation
light and heat control
intelligent software analysis for pest and disease prediction, soil management and other involved analytical tasks
Biotech is another type of agri-tech.

==Practical use-case of Technology in Agribusiness==

Agriculture has been wrongly perceived in the past as a "dirty job" for the old people in rural communities but with the renaissance Technology brought to Agriculture, young people now see it as a potential sector to explore.

This is the practical use of Technology in Agriculture by a few start-ups in Africa.

===Mobile Application for Agriculture===

There is a Nigeria’s digital agriculture platform  which focused on connecting farm sponsors with real farmers in order to increase food production while promoting youth participation in agriculture.

This agritech startup is currently disrupting the agriculture ecosystem in the country by connecting small-scale farmers with investors using their platform App which is available on Google and Apple app stores.

Farmers and sponsors all receive a percentage of the profits on harvest. The platform also makes provision for insurance cover for all existing farm projects, so that in the event of unforeseen circumstances, the sponsors’ capital can be refunded.

===Drones for Agriculture ===
Drones can be used on Crop field for scanning with compact multispectral imaging sensors, GPS map creation through onboard cameras, heavy payload transportation, and livestock monitoring with thermal-imaging camera-equipped drones.

High-income countries have seen recent improvements in their agricultural management systems through modern remote sensing technology, such as satellites and aircraft and the information they collect. Out of the vast amount of data collected, advice is provided to farmers and fishers to help inform their decisions.

This has led to better crop yields, higher quality produce and more sustainable agricultural practices in some cases. Big data also informs high-level decision-makers on how to better manage food supply at national and regional levels.

The use of small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) better known as 'drones' for agricultural purposes is a new emerging technology which could revolutionise the way agricultural entrepreneurs interact with their land, water, crops and infrastructure. UAVs can be made specifically for business use and farming in particular, they can capture geo-referenced, overlapping, high-resolution images (2–5&amp;nbsp;cm) of 400 hectares in a single flight; can seamlessly upload data and produce agricultural analytics from their data management systems, and fly autonomously from take-off to landing.

{{empty section|date=December 2016}}

===Blockchain for Agriculture===

A blockchain is a digitized, decentralized, public ledger of all cryptocurrency transactions. Constantly growing as ‘completed’ blocks (the most recent transactions) are recorded and added to it in chronological order, it allows market participants to keep track of digital currency transactions without central recordkeeping. Each node (a computer connected to the network) gets a copy of the blockchain, which is downloaded automatically.

Originally developed as the accounting method for the virtual currency Bitcoin, blockchains – which use what's known as distributed ledger technology (DLT) – are appearing in a variety of commercial applications today. Currently, the technology is primarily used to verify transactions, within digital currencies though it is possible to digitize, code and insert practically any document into the blockchain. Doing so creates an indelible record that cannot be changed; furthermore, the record’s authenticity can be verified by the entire community using the blockchain instead of a single centralized authority.

Today, Blockchain is revolutionizing the Agriculture sector in many ways including

Trading commodities on the blockchain is helping to reduce middlemen interference by promoting a peer-to-peer model of connecting farmers with end users. It is also helping to promote fairer trades by removing trade barriers, reducing over reliance on United States Dollars and promoting cross-border trading in local currency.

Other methods of leveraging blockchain technology is in settling land disputes through blockchain based land registry, and using QR codes to promote traceability.

{{empty section|date=December 2016}}

==ICT for Agriculture==
Information Communication Technologies like podcasts, weblogs, social media platforms, e-books are constantly helping to bridge the information gap in the Agriculture sector for farmers and Agripreneurs.

==Hydroponics Technology==
Hydroponics is a soilless farming technology that is used to grow vegetables and tomatoes.

It guarantees an all-year-round production for farmers and insulates these crops from the effects of climate change.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3907">'''Al-Mansur al-Husayn II''' (14 June 1696 - 6 March 1748) was an [[Imam]] of [[Yemen]] who ruled in 1727-1748. He belonged to the [[Qasimid]] family, descendants of [[Muhammad]], who dominated the [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] [[imamate]] of Yemen in 1597-1962.

==Accession==

Al-Husayn bin al-Qasim was a son of Imam [[al-Mutawakkil al-Qasim]]. At the end of his father's reign, he entertained contacts with the rebellious tribesmen of [[Hashid]] and [[Bakil]]. However, the rebellion died down and there seem to have been no further consequences for his illoyal conduct. When al-Mutawakkil al-Qasim died some months later, in 1727, al-Husayn went to [[San'a]] where, after his father's funeral, he laid claim to the imamate and took the title al-Mansur al-Husayn. He was opposed by another claimant, [[an-Nasir Muhammad]], who was supported by the Hashid and Bakil, and by the lord of [[Kawkaban]]. Al-Mansur al-Husayn II retained control over San'a but found reason to pay allegiance to an-Nasir Muhammad. Somewhat later, new trouble flared up. Al-Mansur al-Husayn II was successful in routing his opponent's forces and captured the latter's sons. In about 1729 an-Nasir Muhammad appeared at the court of al-Mansur al-Husayn and submitted. That left the Zaidi state in the hands of al-Mansur al-Husayn II.&lt;ref&gt;R. Serjeant &amp; R. Lewcock, ''San'a'; An Arabian Islamic City''. London 1983, p. 84; R.L. Playfair, ''A History of Arabia Felix or Yemen''. Bombay 1859, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Loss of territory==

These days witnessed economic changes detrimental to the power of the Zaidi state. [[Coffee]] had hitherto been almost solely produced in Yemen, and the rising prices provided great incomes for the country. However, in 1723 coffee began to be imported to [[Europe]] from [[Java]], and in the 1740s from the [[West Indies]].&lt;ref&gt;R.J. Gavin, ''Aden under British ule, 1839-1967''. London 1975, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The losses of revenue were accompanied by loss of territory. In 1731 the imam's agents in the [[Aden]] area were murdered by a chief in [[Lahej]], Fadl bin Ali al-Abdali. When al-Mansur al-Husayn II sent tribesmen to deal with al-Abdali, he took refuge in [[Yafa]]. There he persuaded the local sultan to help him driving the imam's forces from Aden and Lahej. From this date (or, in another version, from 1728) the South Yemeni [[Sultanate of Lahej]] managed its independence from the Zaidi state. Al-Mansur al-Husayn II was also opposed by his brother Ahmad, who governed [[Ta'izz]] and kept the revenues for himself.&lt;ref&gt;R. Serjeant &amp; R. Lewcock, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trouble with the French==

In 1738 a serious crises occurred in the relations between the Zaidi government and the [[France|French]] traders in [[Mocha, Yemen|Mocha]]. The governor in Mocha had the habit of purchasing goods from foreigners and, instead of paying, promise to deduct future duties. When a debt of 82,000 dollars had accumulated, the [[French East India Company]] demanded the governor to pay. As the governor refused, the city was besieged. After a severe reverse, the governor was forced to liquidate the debt. A new treaty was signed, where the duties were lowered. The imam was displeased with the conduct of the governor, who was subsequently recalled.&lt;ref&gt;R.L. Playfair, ''A History of Arabia Felix or Yemen''. Bombay 1859, p. 115-116.&lt;/ref&gt; The imam died in 1748, and was succeeded by his son [[al-Mahdi Abbas]].

'''Collaborative journalism''' is a mode of [[journalism]] where multiple [[reporters]] or news organizations, without affiliation to a common parent organization, report on and contribute [[news]] items to a news story together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Novin|first=Alamir|date=17 August 2013|title=DEBATECITED: An empirical experiment into the value of open-source research methods and peer collaboration to science journalism|url=http://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/977526/4/DEBATECITED_A1b.pdf|journal=Spectrum. Masters thesis, Concordia University.|volume=|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is practiced by both professional and amateur reporters. It is not to be mixed up with [[citizen journalism]].

==Further definition==

Collaborative journalism involves the aggregation of information from numerous individuals or organizations into a single news story.  Information is gathered through research or reporting, or added when readers examine, comment and build upon existing stories.  Stories from the [[mainstream]] media are often built upon.  Depending on the system of collaboration, individuals may also provide [[feedback]] or [[vote]] on whether an article is newsworthy.  A single collaborative news story, therefore, may encompass multiple authors, varying articles, and ranged perspectives.&lt;ref name=CCJ&gt;Whatis.com "[http://searchsoa.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid26_gci1090596,00.html What is collaborative citizen journalism?]" 2006, ''TechTarget''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Professional]] and [[amateur]] reporters may work together to develop collaborative news articles, or mainstream media sites may gather amateur blog posts to complement reporting.&lt;ref&gt;Instablogs "[http://www.instablogs.com/tour/ Instablogs Tour] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307204057/http://www.instablogs.com/tour/ |date=2009-03-07 }}" 2007, ''Instablogs''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Collaborative journalists either contribute directly to stories, sometimes through a wiki-style collaboration platform, or build upon the story externally, often through personal blogs.  Collaborative journalists develop or examine a story one piece at a time.  This contrasts the [[time limit|deadline]] and completion-centered nature of [[traditional media]].  A story is built upon continually, and a popular story may receive daily updates.&lt;ref name=CCJ/&gt;  Through combined authorship, collaborative journalism is thought by some to offer an increased independence of thought and experience unavailable to traditional media.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;Stelter, Brian. "[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/13/business/media/13reach.html?scp=1&amp;sq=Mainstream%20News%20Outlets%20Start%20Linking%20to%20Other%20Sites&amp;st=cse Mainstream News Outlets Start Linking to Other Sites]" 12 October 2008, ''New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

Successful collaborative journalism projects require a participatory community with respect for content.  Ross Mayfield, CEO of SocialText, has commented on wiki-style collaborative journalism:&lt;ref name="Glaser"&gt;Glaser, Mark.  "[http://www.ojr.org/ojr/glaser/1094678265.php Collaborative Conundrum: Do Wikis Have a Place in the Newsroom?]" 2004, ''USC Annenberg: Online Journalism Review''&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Most user-generated content isn't content, but conversation.  Cultivating community is a decided practice. It boils down to the social contract you make with your readers-turned-writers. If they trust that their effort and words will be appropriated appropriately, while providing social incentives for participation, it can very well work."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==

Collaborative journalism emerged through the [[internet]] in the early 2000s, and developed gradually through various online outlets.  As examples, [[Wikinews]] was founded in 2003, and [[NewsVine]] in 2005.

===Panama Papers===
The [[Panama Papers]] project may be the largest example of a journalistic consortium to date. It began sometime in 2015 (date?) when [[Bastian Obermayer]], an investigative reporter with the south German newspaper [[Süddeutsche Zeitung]], was contacted by an anonymous source&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/06/business/media/how-a-cryptic-message-interested-in-data-led-to-the-panama-papers.html|title=How a Cryptic Message, ‘Interested in Data?,’ Led to the Panama Papers|last=Clark|first=Nicola|date=2016-04-05|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2017-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and offered the trove of 11.5 million electronic documents from [[Mossack Fonseca]], the world’s fourth biggest offshore law firm detailing a web of secret offshore deals and loans worth billions of dollars, and details of tax avoidance designs in numerous countries. The newspaper's editors decided they could not handle the massive volume of information alone and initiated a collaborative journalistic consortium including more than 140 journalists and the [[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists]], a project of the [[nonprofit]] [[Center for Public Integrity]].

==Football Leaks (2016/2017)==
{{main|Football Leaks}}
The [[European Investigative Collaborations]] (EIC) working with "over 60 journalists in 14 countries" published a "series of articles called ''Football Leaks''—the "largest leak in sports history".&lt;ref name="theblacksea_2017"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://theblacksea.eu/?idT=3&amp;idC=3 |access-date=October 11, 2017 |location=Bucharest, Romania |year=2017 |publisher=The Black Sea |title=Mission}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Football Leaks'' "led to the prosecution of football superstar [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] and coach [[Jose Mourinho]]."&lt;ref name="horizont_2017"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.horizont.net/medien/nachrichten/Investigativjournalismus-Spiegel-schafft-ressortuebegreifendes-Recherchenetzwerk-160100 |title=Spiegel schafft multimediales Recherchenetzwerk |first=von Hein |last=David Hein |location=Freitag |date=August 4, 2017 |access-date=October 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; EIC was established in the fall of 2015 with founding members that include ''Der Spiegel'', ''El Mundo'', ''Médiapart'', the Romanian Centre for Investigative Journalism (CRJI), and ''Le Soir''.&lt;ref name="EU_gov_Rengers_EIC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/cmsdata/127803/5%20-%2001%20On%20Football%20Leaks%20-%20speaking%20notes%20Merijn%20Rengers.pdf |format=PDF |title=On Football Leaks Speaking notes |first=Merijn |last=Rengers |agency=European Parliament |series=Speaking notes}}NRC Handelsblad, Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="journalismfund_2016_EIC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.journalismfund.eu/news/%E2%80%9Csome-stories-can-get-killed-without-right-network%E2%80%9D |title=Some stories can get killed without the right network |date=March 30, 2016 |access-date=October 11, 2017 |publisher=Journalism Fund formerly Fonds Pascal Decroos voor Bijzondere Journalistiek vzw}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theblacksea_2016_EU"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://theblacksea.eu/index.php?idT=88&amp;idC=88&amp;idRec=1230&amp;recType=multimedia |title=EU’s freedom of goods policy opened door to Paris terror attacks |date=March 18, 2016 |access-date=October 11, 2017 |publisher=The Black Sea}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differentiation from other styles of journalism==

*Collaborative journalism should not be confused with [[citizen journalism]], which is practiced only by amateur reporters who develop stories by actively reporting, collecting, analyzing and disseminating news and information, often through [[blog]]s on the internet.
*It is not [[community journalism]] or [[Civic Journalism|civic journalism]], which are practiced only by professionals:
**In [[community journalism]], professional reporters focus their coverage on smaller communities, such as neighborhoods, suburbs, or small towns (rather than national or international coverage.)
**[[Civic Journalism|Civic journalism]] is the philosophy and practice of professional journalists and newspapers acting as participants within a community, rather than detached spectators.
*Collaborative journalism is similar, but not identical, to [[interactive journalism]], in which consumers contribute to a professional news story through commenting and conversing with the reporter.
*[[Wiki journalism]]  is a type of collaborative journalism.

==Link journalism==

"[[Link journalism]]", a phrase coined by Scott Karp in 2008, is "a form of collaborative journalism in which a news story's writer provides external [[hyperlink|links]] within the story to reporting or other sources on the web."&lt;ref name="Karp"&gt;Karp, Brian. "[http://publishing2.com/2008/02/25/how-link-journalism-could-have-transformed-the-new-york-times-reporting-on-mccain-ethics/ How Link Journalism Could Have Transformed the New York Times Reporting on McCain Ethics]" 2008, ''Publish 2.0 Blog''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Link Journalism"&gt;Publish2 "[http://www.publish2.com/about/what-is-link-journalism What is link journalism?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312060206/http://www.publish2.com/about/what-is-link-journalism |date=2009-03-12 }}" 2009, ''Publish2''.&lt;/ref&gt;    These links are meant to complement, enhance, or add context to the original reporting.  [[Jeff Jarvis]], from the Graduate School of Journalism's new media program at the [[City University of New York]], has said that link journalism creates a "new architecture of news."&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

==Implementation==

Collaborative journalism has been implemented in several different ways.  [[Wikinews]], the "free-content online news source," lets any user edit or create a news story, similar in style to [[Wikipedia]].  Several mainstream news sites have adopted a collaborative journalism approach toward news, through use of news aggregation.  [[The Washington Post]] has developed a political site which links to related content from other news sites.  [[NBC]] links to local newspapers, radio broadcasts, online videos, and blogs on its local television stations' sites.  The sites do not separate articles written by NBC staff and links to outside sources.
[[The New York Times]] has introduced a ''Times Extra'' website feature which acts posts links to outside news sites.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;   Commenting on the launch of ''Times Extra'', [[Marc Frons]], CTO for Digital Operations at the New York Times, said:&lt;ref name="Frons"&gt;Frons, Marc. "[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/28/business/media/28askthetimes.html?adxnnl=1&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;adxnnlx=1217599487-JcYF6S4d34UK1ZlCsX04OA Talk to the Times: Chief Technology Officer, Digital Operations]" 2008, ''New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“In the past, I think many news organizations were afraid to link to other Web sites out of fear that they might be sending people to an unreliable source or that their readers would never return. But those fears were largely misplaced and we’ve seen a much more open policy when it comes to pointing readers at useful content elsewhere on the Web."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other sites exhibit collaborative journalism through aggregation.  On the site [[NewsVine]], for example, wire stories from the Associated Press complement user-generated stories and blog posts.  [[Reddit]] and other news aggregation sites may also act as collaborative journalism sites, depending on where content originates.

== Awards for collaborative journalism ==
Due to the increase in collaborative journalism, several organizations have begun to offer grants or awards for these types of projects. For example, Online Journalism Awards (launched in May 2000) added a new award category for collaborations and partnerships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://awards.journalists.org/2018/05/02/2018-online-journalism-awards-introduce-new-collaboration-category-among-changes/|title="2018 OJAs introduce new Collaboration category, among other changes"|last=|first=|date=|website=Online Journalism Awards|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clean Energy Wire offers grants for collaborative journalism projects on the topic of energy or the climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cleanenergywire.org/grant-collaborative-journalism-for-global-energy-transition|title="Go collaborate!

==Criticism==

Collaborative journalism has received some criticism:
*Some news stories require secrecy as they develop.  Often sources cannot know that they are being investigated or reported on. When a single reporter investigates a person or organization, this secrecy is more likely to be kept.  When news stories are developed collaboratively by multiple journalists, however, secrecy is more likely to be lost and the story jeopardized.&lt;ref name=DigiDave&gt;"[http://www.digidave.org/2009/03/collaboration-is-queen.html Collaboration is Queen] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20090817232727/http://www.digidave.org/2009/03/collaboration-is-queen.html |date=2009-08-17 }}" 2009, ''DigiDave.org''&lt;/ref&gt;
*Quality of collaborative projects may be difficult to assess.  Fact-checking may be difficult, as facts come from many different sources.  Quality of writing and reporting may also differ among contributors.&lt;ref name=Haber&gt;Haber, Marlan Wynne "[http://connection.ebscohost.com/content/article/1026359737.html%3Bjsessionid=E02C44EA6326406DD8BB63E7C014ABC7.ehctc1 Strategies of Collaborative Writing and Intellectual Enrichment.]" 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "'''Consume, be silent, die''''" embodies a critique of [[Consumerism|consumer culture]],
capturing what [[Raoul Vaneigem]] called "the poverty of abundance".
Variants include "work, consume, be silent, die" and "work, buy, consume, die".
The phrase traces to [[Environmental activism#1970s|1970s environmental protests]]
but regained prominence during the [[Occupy Wall Street]] protests of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/18/us/the-occupy-movements-common-thread-is-anger.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and popular culture==

Some claim the phrase's origin is in 1970s graffiti. One of Benny Zable's GreeDozer costumes includes the phrase. Early photos of this costume are undated, but Hutton and Connors (1999, p.&amp;nbsp;153) report sightings in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, Drew and Libby Connors, A history of the Australian environment movement, Cambridge University Press (April 13, 1999),{{ISBN|978-0-521-45686-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also familiar to train passengers in Sydney as graffiti on the wall of a tunnel approaching Central Station as early as 1972.

* The Belgian philosopher [[Raoul Vaneigem]] expressed a closely related sentiment in his 1967 book ''The Revolution of Everyday Life'': "Work to survive, survive by consuming, survive to consume; the hellish cycle is complete."&lt;ref&gt;Vaneigen, Raoul. "The Revolution of Everyday Life." PM Press, 2012. pg. 53. &lt;/ref&gt;
* The poetry journal ''Moria'' published a photograph by the photographer Ana Viviane Minorelli of the phrase as graffiti.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.moriapoetry.com/minorelli.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* The punk band "Man Will Destroy Himself" have an album entitled ''Consume...Be Silent...Die...''.
* The Summer Camp Riot album ''Mole Patrol'' includes the song "Work Buy Consume Die (Ring The Frickin Bell Already)".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10996">'''Death by boiling''' is a method of [[execution (legal)|execution]] in which a person is killed by being immersed in a [[boiling]] liquid. While not as common as other methods of execution, boiling to death has been used in many parts of [[Europe]] and [[Asia]].

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Bhai Dayala Ji being boiled alive by the Muslim Moguls 1675 A.D.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Sikh martyr [[Bhai Dayala]] being boiled alive by the orders of Mughul Emperor [[Aurangzeb]] in November 1675 A.D.]] --&gt;
Executions of this type were often carried out using a large vessel such as a [[cauldron]] or a sealed [[kettle]] that was filled with a liquid such as water, oil, [[tar]], or [[tallow]], and a [[Pulley|hook and pulley]] system.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Abbott, ''Execution blunders'', pages 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical practice==

===Europe===
[[File:Deventer ketel.jpg|thumb|upright|Execution cauldron at [[Deventer]] ([[Netherlands]])]]
In England, the 9th statute passed in 1531 (the 22nd year of the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]]) made boiling alive the prescriptive form of capital punishment for murder committed by [[poison]]ing, which by the same Act was defined as [[High Treason]].&lt;ref&gt;'Anno 22 Henry VIII (1530-31), Chapter 9', in ''The Statutes of the Realm'' Vol. 3: The Statutes of King Henry VIII, (By Command 1817), Reprint (Dawsons of Pall Mall, London 1963), [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pst.000017915533;view=1up;seq=382 p. 326] (Hathi Trust).&lt;/ref&gt; This arose from an incident in which the [[John Fisher|Bishop of Rochester's]] cook, [[Richard Roose]], gave several people poisoned [[porridge]], resulting in two deaths in February 1531.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Kesselring| first = K.J.| date = Sep 2001|title = A Draft of the 1531 'Acte for Poysoning'|jstor = 579196| pages = 894–899 | publisher = The English Historical Review Vol. 116, No. 468}}&lt;/ref&gt; A partial confession having been extracted by torture, the sentence was thus imposed by [[attainder]] and without [[benefit of clergy]].&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Boiling to Death|volume=4|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; A contemporary chronicle reports the following:&lt;ref&gt;(S.H. Burke), ''The Men and Women of the English Reformation'' (R. Washbourne, London 1870), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=b58HAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA240#v=onepage p. 240] (Google).&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|He roared mighty loud, and divers women who were big with child did feel sick at the sight of what they saw, and were carried away half dead; and other men and women did not seem frightened by the boiling alive, but would prefer to see the headsman at his work.}}
Boiling to death was employed again in 1542 for a woman, Margaret Davy,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} who had also used poison.&lt;ref name=Newlin2000&gt;{{Citation | last = Newlin | first = George | year = 2000 | title = Understanding Great expectations | pages = 136 | isbn = 978-0-313-29940-7 | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = Westport, Conn. | oclc = 41488673 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leslie, Frank, Frank Leslie, and Ellery Sedgwick. 1876. Frank Leslie's popular monthly. [New York]: Frank Leslie Pub. House. p 343&lt;/ref&gt; During the reign of [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], in 1547, the 1531 act was repealed.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Scotland has several traditions of persons boiled to death. For example, in 1222, with the consent of [[Jon Haraldsson]], the "Bloody Earl" of [[Orkney]], the bishop of [[Caithness]] [[Adam of Melrose]] and a monk named Surlo, are said to have been boiled to death by angry husbandmen over the bishop's aggressive means of collecting tithes. [[Alexander II of Scotland|Alexander II]] is said to have executed upwards to eighty persons as a punishment for the crime,  and the earl fled his lands.&lt;ref&gt;Pinkerton: "[https://books.google.com/books?id=mFJBAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA158 A General Collection of the Best and Most Interesting Voyages], Volume 3", London 1809, p.158 The same tradition is transmitted in {{Cite book | last =Journal| first =| year =1842| title = The Scottish journal of topography, antiquities, traditions| pages =248| isbn = | publisher = Stevenson and Menzies| location =Edinburgh| oclc =}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Melrose Chronicle]], Adam of Melrose was "burned alive", rather than boiled, and Alexander III executed up to 400.&lt;ref&gt;''Soc. Diff. Use. Knowl.'' (1842), [https://books.google.com/books?id=f5VUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA310#v=onepage p.310] in {{Cite book | last =Society for Diffusion of Useful Knowledge| first =| year =1842| title = The Biographical Dictionary| pages =310| isbn = | publisher = Longman, Brown, Green, and Longmans| location =London| oclc =}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William de Soules]], a nobleman involved in a conspiracy against [[Robert the Bruce]], was reputed to be a sorcerer consorting with evil spirits, and was boiled alive in 1321 at [[Ninestane Rig]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=yRMeAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA216 The Complete Works of Sir Walter Scott], New York 1833 p.216&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1420, Melville, the sheriff of the [[Kincardineshire|Mearns]] and laird of [[Glenbervie]], who was resented for his strictness, was apprehended by some other nobles and thrown into the kettle. The nobles are said each to have taken a spoonful of the brew afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=6NE9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA34 The new statistical account of Scotland, Volum 18]", Edinburgh 1838, pp.34-35&lt;/ref&gt;

Boiling as an execution method was also used for [[counterfeiter]]s, [[swindler]]s and [[forger|coin forger]]s during the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Monter|first=E. William |title=A bewitched duchy: Lorraine and its dukes, 1477-1736|publisher=Librairie Droz|year=2007|page=163|ISBN=978-2-600-01165-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[Holy Roman Empire]], for example, being boiled to death in oil is recorded for [[forger|coin forgers]] and extremely grave murderers. In 1392, a man was boiled alive in Nuremberg for having raped and murdered his own mother.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, M.M: "[https://books.google.com/books?id=HS1BAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA102 Kleine Chronik der Reichsstadt Nürnberg: Mit einem Grundrisse], Nuremberg 1847 p.102,&lt;/ref&gt; Coin forgers were boiled to death in 1452 in [[Danzig]]&lt;ref&gt;Krüger, J.G: "[https://books.google.com/books?id=RnMAAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA20 Die beglückte und geschmückte Stadt Lübeck]", 1697, p.20&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1471 in [[Stralsund]].&lt;ref&gt;
Klemptzen, N.von:"[https://books.google.com/books?id=OldFAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA37 Nicolaus Klemzen vom Pommer-lande und dessen fürsten geschlecht-beschreibung]", Stralsund 1771, p.39&lt;/ref&gt; Even as late as in 1687, a man was boiled to death in oil in [[Bremen]] for having been of valuable help to some coin forgers who had escaped justice.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=BnIDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA116 Blätter für literarische Unterhaltung, Volum 1], p.116, review of "Taschenbuch für vaterländische Geschichte", Berlin 1843&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Dutch town of [[Deventer]], the kettle that was used for boiling criminals to death can still be seen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetware.com/deventer/weigh-house-nl-ov-dwh.htm|title=10 Top Tourist Attractions in Arnhem &amp; Easy Day Trips - PlanetWare|author=|date=|website=planetware.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===
[[File:Excecution of Goemon Ishikawa.jpg|thumb|upright|Bandit [[Ishikawa Goemon]] was boiled to death for the attempted assassination of warlord [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] in 16th-century Japan.]]
In 16th-century Japan, the semi-legendary Japanese bandit [[Ishikawa Goemon]] was boiled alive in a large iron kettle-shaped bathtub.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pixelmap.ca/gallery2/rumi/japan_2010/IMG_2189.jpg.html Goemonburo - Goemon-style bath] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706193636/http://www.pixelmap.ca/gallery2/rumi/japan_2010/IMG_2189.jpg.html |date=July 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His public execution, which might have included his entire family, was done after he failed to kill warlord [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]].

In 1675, a [[Sikh]] [[martyr]], called [[Bhai Dayala]], was boiled to death in [[Delhi]] after he refused to accept [[Islam]]. He was put into a [[cauldron]] full of cold water which was then heated to boiling point. Sikh scriptures record that Dayala recited the [[Japji]] of [[Guru Nanak]] and the [[Sukhmani]] of [[Guru Arjan]] as he died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singha|first=H. S |title=The encyclopedia of Sikhism|publisher=Hemkunt Press|year=2000|page=56|ISBN=978-81-7010-301-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern times===
The government of [[Uzbekistan]] under [[Islam Karimov]] has been alleged to have boiled suspected terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Uzbekistan: Two Brutal Deaths in Custody|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2002/08/09/uzbekistan-two-brutal-deaths-custody|accessdate=6 January 2015|publisher=Hrw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2004 document from [[US Department of State]], the following is written:{{quote|During the year, there were no developments or investigations in the following 2002 deaths in custody: Mirzakomil Avazov and Khusnuddin Olimov, members of [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] who were tortured to death in [[Jaslyk Prison]] in [[Karakalpakstan]] resulting in extensive bruises and burns, the latter reportedly caused by immersion in boiling water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2003/27873.htm|title=Uzbekistan|author=|date=|website=state.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}Former ISIS commander Abu Abboud al-Raqqawi referred to ISIS' brutal execution methods, among others, boiling prisoners alive in engine oil:

{{quote|Some people were boiled alive in oil. Engine oil. They burned wood on a fire for an hour before throwing the victim into boiling oil. It's the Tunisians who were responsible for that.[https://www.expressen.se/nyheter/qs/avhoppade-ledaren-talar-ut-om-livet-med-is/]}}

==Depictions in Western culture==
Early reports of [[cannibals]] from islands in the Pacific, such as [[Fiji]] or [[Papua New Guinea]], killing western [[Christian missionaries]] were assumed to involve some form of boiling alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thatsweird.net/news19.shtml|title=Villagers apologize for cannibal ancestors eating missionary: Weird News, Strange But True Stories, Odd Facts, Bizarre|author=|date=|website=www.thatsweird.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; This became a fertile ground for film makers and especially cartoonists, whose clichéd depiction of tourists or missionaries sitting restrained in a large cauldron above a wood fire and surrounded by bone-nosed tribesmen was a staple of popular magazines and film for decades. Examples include the dream sequence in the movie ''[[Bagdad Café]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiefilm.com/cookbook/encyclopedia/ecmB.html|title=Encyclopedia of Cannibal Movies: B|first=Satellite Ground|last=Systems|date=|website=www.indiefilm.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Decodoku''' is set of [[online]] [[citizen science]] games, based on [[quantum error correction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome to Decodoku|url=http://decodoku.blogspot.ch/2016/01/welcome-to-decodoku-this-is-blog-for.html|website=Decodoku Website|accessdate=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project is supported by the NCCR QSIT&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=News &amp; Events|url=http://www.nccr-qsit.ethz.ch/news.html|website=QSIT Website|accessdate=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[University of Basel]], and allows the public to get involved with quantum error correction research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Playful Approach to Quantum Computing|url=https://www.unibas.ch/en/News-Events/News/Uni-Research/A-playful-approach-to-quantum-computing.html|website=University of Basel News|accessdate=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tüfteln und knobeln für die Forschung|url=http://verlag.baz.ch/artikel/?objectid=9E3E12D7-4F17-488D-9FCD6C843AA3B658|accessdate=29 September 2016|agency=Basler Zeitung|date=25 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The games present the clues left in a quantum computer when errors occur, and encourage the players to work out how best to correct them. These puzzles are presented in a manner similar to typical casual puzzle games, like 2048, [[Threes (game)|Threes]] or [[Sudoku]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Decodoku is a new puzzle game with a scientific twist|url=http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Android/Decodoku/feature.asp?c=70841|website=Pocket Gamer|publisher=Steel Media|accessdate=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the scientific background explained via the project website and [[YouTube]] channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Decodoku Channel|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpH8JwlUfbC2sfY6ywuizEw|website=YouTube|accessdate=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus far three games have been released: Decodoku, Decodoku:Puzzles and Decodoku:Colors.

'''Duncan Peder McKenzie, Jr.''', (October 5, 1951 &amp;ndash; May 11, 1995) was convicted of the murder of a [[Conrad, Montana]] schoolteacher named Lana Harding on January 21, 1974. After his conviction in March 1975, he was on [[death row]] for 20 years, receiving eight [[stay of execution|stays of execution]].

The '''East Formosan languages''' consist of various [[Formosan languages]] scattered across Taiwan, including [[Kavalan language|Kavalan]], [[Amis language|Amis]], and the extinct [[Siraya language]]. This grouping is supported by both [[Robert Blust]] and [[Paul Jen-kuei Li]]. Li considers the Siraya-speaking area in the southwestern plains of Taiwan to be most likely homeland of the East Formosan speakers, where they then spread to the eastern coast of Taiwan and gradually migrated to the area of modern-day [[Taipei]] (Li 2004).

==Languages==
*Kavalanic
**[[Kavalan language|Kavalan]]
**[[Ketagalan language|Ketagalan]]
**[[Basay language|Basay]]
*Amis
**[[Ami languages|Ami]]
**[[Sakizaya language|Sakizaya]]
*[[Proto-Siraya language|Sirayaic]]
**[[Siraya language|Siraya]]
**Taivoan–Makatao
***[[Taivoan language|Taivoan]]
***[[Makatao language|Makatao]]

==Evidence==
Li (2004) presents the following criteria as evidence for an East Formosan subgrouping.

#Merger of *C and *t as /t/
#Merger of *D and *Z as /r/ or /l/ in Basay, as /z/ in Kavalan
#Merger of *q, *H, *ʔɦ and zero
#Merger of *j, *n, and *N as /n/
#Shift of *k into /q/ and /q/ &gt; /h/ (Basay only) before *a

Li (2004) notes that the split of *k into k and q (before *a) is shared exclusively by Basay and Kavalan. Like Kavalan and Basay, the Siraya language merges the patient-focus and locative-focus forms, although Amis distinguishes the two focus forms. Li (2004) also lists dozens of lexical innovations shared by the East Formosan languages.

The [[Basay language|Basay]], [[Kavalan language|Kavalan]], and [[Amis language|Amis]] also share an oral tradition stating a common origin from an island called “Sinasay” or “Sanasay,” which is probably the [[Green Island, Taiwan|Green Island]] of today.&lt;ref name="Li"&gt;Li, Paul Jen-kuei. 2008.

[[File:Sengakuji 47 ronin graves.jpg|thumb|Graves of the forty-seven rōnin at [[Sengaku-ji]]]]
The revenge of the {{nihongo|'''forty-seven ''rōnin'''''|四十七士|Shi-jū-shichi-shi|forty-seven samurai}}, also known as the {{nihongo|'''Akō incident'''|赤穂事件|Akō jiken}} or ''Akō vendetta'', is an 18th-century historical event in Japan in which a band of ''[[rōnin]]'' (leaderless [[samurai]]) avenged the death of their master. The incident has since become legendary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.columbia.edu/~hds2/chushinguranew/kanadehon/Index.htm | title = Kanadehon | publisher = Columbia University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story tells of a group of samurai who were left leaderless (becoming ''[[rōnin]]'') after their ''[[daimyō]]'' (feudal lord) [[Asano Naganori]] was compelled to perform ''[[seppuku]]'' (ritual suicide) for assaulting a court official named [[Kira Yoshinaka]], whose title was ''[[Kōzuke Province|Kōzuke]] no [[Kokushi (official)|suke]]''. After waiting and planning for a year, the ''rōnin'' avenged their master's honor by killing Kira. In turn, they were themselves obliged to commit ''seppuku'' for committing the crime of [[murder]]. This true story was popularized in Japanese culture as emblematic of the loyalty, sacrifice, persistence, and honor that people should preserve in their daily lives. The popularity of the tale grew during the [[Meiji period|Meiji]] era, in which Japan underwent rapid modernization, and the legend became entrenched within discourses of national heritage and identity.

Fictionalized accounts of the tale of the Forty-seven Rōnin are known as ''[[Chūshingura]].'' The story was popularized in numerous plays, including ''[[bunraku]]'' and ''[[kabuki]]''. Because of the [[censorship]] laws of the [[Tokugawa shogunate|shogunate]] in the ''[[Genroku]]'' [[Japanese era name|era]], which forbade portrayal of current events, the names were changed. While the version given by the playwrights may have come to be accepted as historical fact by some {{who|date=March 2014}}, the first ''Chūshingura'' was written some 50 years after the event, and numerous historical records about the actual events that predate the ''Chūshingura'' survive.

The ''bakufu'''s censorship laws had relaxed somewhat 75 years later in the late 18th century, when Japanologist [[Isaac Titsingh]] first recorded the story of the forty-seven ''rōnin'' as one of the significant events of the ''Genroku'' era.&lt;ref name="s91"&gt;Screech, T. (2006). ''Secret Memoirs of the Shoguns: Isaac Titsingh and Japan,'' p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; To this day, the story continues to be popular in Japan, and each year on December 14, [[Sengaku-ji|Sengakuji Temple]], where Asano Naganori and the ''rōnin'' are buried, holds a festival commemorating the event.

==Name==
The event is known in Japan as the {{nihongo|''Akō incident''|赤穂事件|Akō jiken}}, sometimes also referred to as the ''Akō vendetta''. The participants in the revenge are called the {{nihongo|Akō-rōshi|赤穂浪士}} or {{nihongo|Shi-jū-shichi-shi|四十七士}} in Japanese, and are usually referred to as the "Forty-seven Rōnin" or "Forty-seven leaderless samurai" in English. Literary accounts of the events are known as the {{nihongo|''Chūshingura''|忠臣蔵|The Treasury of Loyal Retainers}}.

==Story==
For many years, the version of events retold by [[Algernon Freeman-Mitford, 1st Baron Redesdale|A. B. Mitford]] in ''[[Tales of Old Japan]]'' (1871) was considered authoritative{{by whom|date=July 2018}}. The sequence of events and the characters in this narrative were presented to a wide popular readership in the [[Western world|West]]. Mitford invited his readers to construe his story of the Forty-seven Rōnin as historically accurate; and while his version of the tale has long been considered a standard work, some of its precise details are now questioned.&lt;ref name=smith1&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/~hds2/chushinguranew/retelling/Mitford.htm#Analysis Analysis of Mitford's story] by [http://www.columbia.edu/~hds2/ Dr. Henry Smith], [http://www.columbia.edu/~hds2/chushinguranew/index.htm Chushinguranew website], Columbia University&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, even with plausible defects, Mitford's work remains a conventional starting point for further study.&lt;ref name=smith1/&gt;

Whether as a mere literary device or as a claim for ethnographic veracity, Mitford explains:
{{quote |''In the midst of a nest of venerable trees in [[Takanawa]], a suburb of Yedo, is hidden Sengakuji, or the Spring-hill Temple, renowned throughout the length and breadth of the land for its cemetery, which contains the graves of the Forty-seven Rônin, famous in Japanese history, heroes of Japanese drama, '''the tale of whose deed I am about to transcribe'''. | Mitford, A. B.&lt;ref&gt;(1871). ''Tales of Old Japan,'' pp. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; [emphasis added]}}

Mitford appended what he explained were translations of Sengaku-ji documents the author had examined personally. These were proffered as "proofs" authenticating the factual basis of his story.&lt;ref&gt;Mitford, pp. 28–34.&lt;/ref&gt; These documents were:
# ''...the receipt given by the retainers of Kira Kôtsuké no Suké's son in return for the head of their lord's father, which the priests restored to the family.''&lt;ref name="Mitford, p. 30"&gt;Mitford, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''...a document explanatory of their conduct, a copy of which was found on the person of each of the forty-seven men,'' dated in the 15th year of Genroku, 12th month.&lt;ref&gt;Mitford, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''...a paper which the Forty-seven Rǒnin laid upon the tomb of their master, together with the head of Kira Kôtsuké no Suké.''&lt;ref&gt;Mitford, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

(See ''[[Tales of Old Japan]]'' for the widely known, yet significantly fictional narrative.)

===Genesis of a tragedy===
[[File:Chushingura Matsu no Oroka.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Ukiyo-e]] print depicting Asano Naganori's assault on Kira Yoshinaka in the ''Matsu no Ōrōka'' of Edo Castle]]
[[File:MatsuNoORoka.jpg|thumb|Memorial stone marking the site of the ''Matsu no Ōrōka'' (Great Corridor of Pines) in [[Edo Castle]], where Asano attacked Kira]]
In 1701, two ''[[daimyō]]s'', [[Asano Naganori|Asano Takumi-no-Kami Naganori]], the young ''daimyō'' of the [[Akō Domain]] (a small [[fiefdom]] in western [[Honshū]]), and Lord Kamei Korechika of the [[Tsuwano Domain]], were ordered to arrange a fitting reception for the envoys of [[Emperor Higashiyama|the Emperor]] at [[Edo Castle]], during their ''[[sankin-kōtai]]'' service to the ''[[shōgun]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Mitford, A. B. (1871). ''Tales of Old Japan'', p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

These ''daimyō'' names are not fictional, nor is there any question that something actually happened in {{nihongo|''Genroku'' (year) 15, on the 14th day of the 12th month|元禄十五年十二月十四日||Tuesday, January 30, 1703}}.&lt;ref name="Tsuchihashi conversion"&gt;[http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/geschichte-japans/nengo_calc.htm Tsuchihashi conversion] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930014735/http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/geschichte-japans/nengo_calc.htm |date=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; What is commonly called ''the Akō incident'' was an actual event.&lt;ref name="s91"/&gt;

Asano and Kamei were to be given instruction in the necessary court etiquette by Kira Kozuke-no-Suke Yoshinaka, a powerful official in the hierarchy of [[Tokugawa Tsunayoshi]]'s shogunate. He became upset at them, allegedly either because of the insufficient presents they offered him (in the time-honored compensation for such an instructor), or because they would not offer bribes as he wanted. Other sources say that he was naturally rude and arrogant or that he was corrupt, which offended Asano, a devoutly [[moral]] [[Confucian]]. By some accounts, it also appears that Asano may have been unfamiliar with the intricacies of the shogunate court and failed to show the proper amount of deference to Kira. Whether Kira treated them poorly, insulted them, or failed to prepare them for fulfilling specific ''[[bakufu]]'' duties,&lt;ref&gt;Mitford, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; offence was taken.&lt;ref name = "s91" /&gt;

Initially, Asano bore all this stoically, while Kamei became enraged and prepared to kill Kira to avenge the insults. However, Kamei's quick-thinking counselors averted disaster for their lord and clan (for all would have been punished if Kamei had killed Kira) by quietly giving Kira a large bribe; Kira thereupon began to treat Kamei nicely, which calmed Kamei.&lt;ref&gt;Mitford, pp. 8–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Kira allegedly continued to treat Asano harshly because he was upset that the latter had not emulated his companion. Finally, Kira insulted Asano, calling him a country boor with no manners, and Asano could restrain himself no longer. At the ''[[Matsu no Ōrōka]]'', the main grand corridor that interconnects the ''Shiro-[[shoin]]'' (白書院) and the ''Ōhiroma'' of the ''Honmaru Goten'' (本丸御殿) residence, Asano lost his temper and attacked Kira with a dagger, wounding him in the face with his first strike; his second missed and hit a pillar. Guards then quickly separated them.&lt;ref&gt;Mitford, pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kira's wound was hardly serious, but the attack on a shogunate official within the boundaries of the ''shōgun''{{'}}s residence was considered a grave offence. Any kind of violence, even the drawing of a [[katana]], was completely forbidden in [[Edo Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;Mitford, pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''daimyō'' of Akō had removed his dagger from its scabbard within Edo Castle, and for that offence, he was ordered to kill himself by ''[[seppuku]]''.&lt;ref name = "s91" /&gt; Asano's goods and lands were to be confiscated after his death, his family was to be ruined, and his retainers were to be made ''[[rōnin]]'' (leaderless).

This news was carried to [[Ōishi Yoshio|Ōishi Kuranosuke Yoshio]], Asano's principal counsellor, who took command and moved the Asano family away before complying with ''bakufu'' orders to surrender the castle to the agents of the government.

===The ''rōnin'' plot revenge===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2011}}
[[File:Utagawa Kunisada-c1850-Horibe Yahei-Horibe Yasubei.jpg|thumb|Two of the Forty-Seven Rōnin: Horibe Yahei and his adopted son, Horibe Yasubei. Yasubei is holding an [[ōtsuchi]].]]
Of Asano's over 300 men, 47, especially their leader Ōishi, refused to allow their lord to go unavenged, even though revenge had been prohibited in the case. They banded together, swearing a secret oath to avenge their master by killing Kira, even though they knew that they would be severely punished for doing so.

Kira was well guarded, however, and his residence had been fortified to prevent just such an event. The ''rōnin'' saw that they would have to lull the suspicions of Kira and other shogunate authorities, so they dispersed and became tradesmen and monks.

Ōishi took up residence in Kyoto and began to frequent brothels and taverns, as if nothing were further from his mind than revenge. Kira still feared a trap and sent spies to watch Asano's former retainers.

One day, as Ōishi was returning home drunk, he fell down in the street and went to sleep, and all the passers-by laughed at him. A [[Satsuma Domain|Satsuma]] man was so infuriated by this behaviour on the part of a samurai&amp;mdash;by his lack of courage to avenge his master as well as his current debauched behaviour&amp;mdash;that he abused and insulted Ōishi, kicking him in the face (to even touch the face of a samurai was a great insult, let alone strike it) and spitting on him.

Not too long after, Ōishi divorced his loyal wife of twenty years so that no harm would come to her when the ''rōnin'' took their revenge. He sent her away with their two younger children to live with her parents; he gave their eldest boy, Chikara, the choice to stay and fight or to leave. Chikara remained with his father.

Ōishi began to act oddly and very unlike the composed samurai. He frequented geisha houses (particularly [[Ichiriki Chaya]]), drank nightly, and acted obscenely in public. Ōishi's men bought a geisha, hoping she would calm him. This was all a ruse to rid Ōishi of his spies.

Kira's agents reported all this to Kira, who became convinced that he was safe from Asano's retainers, that they must all be bad samurai indeed, without the courage to avenge their master after a year and a half. Thinking them harmless and lacking funds from his "retirement", he then reluctantly let down his guard.

The rest of the faithful ''rōnin'' now gathered in Edo, and in their roles as workmen and merchants gained access to Kira's house, becoming familiar with the layout of the house and the character of all within. One of the retainers (Okano Kinemon Kanehide) went so far as to marry the daughter of the builder of the house, to obtain the house's design plans. All of this was reported to Ōishi. Others gathered arms and secretly transported them to Edo, another offence.

===The attack===
[[File:Akoroshi in assault equipments 20101213.jpg|thumb|Modern day reenactment of a samurai armed for the attack]]
[[File:HokusaiChushingura.jpg|thumb|The ''rōnin'' attack the principal gate of Kira's mansion]]
After two years, when Ōishi was convinced that Kira was thoroughly off his guard,&lt;ref&gt;Mitford, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; and everything was ready, he fled from Kyoto, avoiding the spies who were watching him, and the entire band gathered at a secret meeting place in Edo to renew their oaths.

In {{nihongo|''Genroku'' 15, on the 14th day of the 12th month|元禄十五年十二月十四日||Tuesday, January 30, 1703}},&lt;ref name="Tsuchihashi conversion"/&gt; early in the morning in a driving wind during a heavy fall of snow, Ōishi and the other ''rōnin'' attacked Kira Yoshinaka's mansion in Edo. According to a carefully laid-out plan, they split up into two groups and attacked, armed with swords and bows. One group, led by Ōishi, was to attack the front gate; the other, led by his son, Ōishi Chikara, was to attack the house via the back gate. A drum would sound the simultaneous attack, and a whistle would signal that Kira was dead.&lt;ref&gt;Mitford, pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once Kira was dead, they planned to cut off his head and lay it as an offering on their master's tomb. They would then turn themselves in and wait for their expected sentence of death.&lt;ref&gt;Mitford, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; All this had been confirmed at a final dinner, at which Ōishi had asked them to be careful and spare women, children, and other helpless people.&lt;ref&gt;Mitford, pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ōishi had four men scale the fence and enter the porter's lodge, capturing and tying up the guard there.&lt;ref&gt;Mitford, pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; He then sent messengers to all the neighboring houses, to explain that they were not robbers, but retainers out to avenge the death of their master, and that no harm would come to anyone else: the neighbors were all safe. One of the ''rōnin'' climbed to the roof and loudly announced to the neighbors that the matter was an act of revenge ([[Revenge#History|katakiuchi]], 敵討ち). The neighbors, who all hated Kira, were relieved and did nothing to hinder the raiders.&lt;ref&gt;Mitford, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

After posting archers (some on the roof) to prevent those in the house (who had not yet awakened) from sending for help, Ōishi sounded the drum to start the attack. Ten of Kira's retainers held off the party attacking the house from the front, but Ōishi Chikara's party broke into the back of the house.&lt;ref&gt;Mitford, pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kira, in terror, took refuge in a closet in the veranda, along with his wife and female servants. The rest of his retainers, who slept in barracks outside, attempted to come into the house to his rescue. After overcoming the defenders at the front of the house, the two parties led by father and son joined up and fought the retainers who came in. The latter, perceiving that they were losing, tried to send for help, but their messengers were killed by the archers posted to prevent that eventuality.&lt;ref&gt;Mitford, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, after a fierce struggle, the last of Kira's retainers was subdued; in the process, the ''rōnin'' killed 16 of Kira's men and wounded 22, including his grandson. Of Kira, however, there was no sign. They searched the house, but all they found were crying women and children. They began to despair, but Ōishi checked Kira's bed, and it was still warm, so he knew he could not be far away.&lt;ref&gt;Mitford, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The death of Kira===
A renewed search disclosed an entrance to a secret courtyard hidden behind a large scroll; the courtyard held a small building for storing charcoal and firewood, where two more hidden armed retainers were overcome and killed. A search of the building disclosed a man hiding; he attacked the searcher with a dagger, but the man was easily disarmed.&lt;ref&gt;Mitford, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

He refused to say who he was, but the searchers felt sure it was Kira, and sounded the whistle. The ''rōnin'' gathered, and Ōishi, with a lantern, saw that it was indeed Kira—as a final proof, his head bore the scar from Asano's attack.&lt;ref&gt;Mitford, pp. 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

At that, Ōishi went on his knees, and in consideration of Kira's high rank, respectfully addressed him, telling him they were retainers of Asano, come to avenge him as true samurai should, and inviting Kira to die as a true samurai should, by killing himself. Ōishi indicated he personally would act as a ''[[kaishakunin]]'' ("second", the one who beheads a person committing seppuku to spare them the indignity of a lingering death) and offered him the same dagger that Asano had used to kill himself.&lt;ref&gt;Mitford, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, no matter how much they entreated him, Kira crouched, speechless and trembling. At last, seeing it was useless to continue asking, Ōishi ordered the other ''rōnin'' to pin him down, and killed him by cutting off his head with the dagger.

They then extinguished all the lamps and fires in the house (lest any cause the house to catch fire and start a general fire that would harm the neighbors) and left, taking Kira's head.&lt;ref&gt;Mitford, pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the ''rōnin'', the ''[[ashigaru]]'' Terasaka Kichiemon, was ordered to travel to Akō and report that their revenge had been completed. (Though Kichiemon's role as a messenger is the most widely accepted version of the story, other accounts have him running away before or after the battle, or being ordered to leave before the ''rōnin'' turned themselves in.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=Henry D. II |year=2004 |title=The Trouble with Terasaka: The Forty-Seventh Ronin and the Chushingura Imagination |journal=Japan Review |pages=16:3–65 |url=http://202.231.40.34/jpub/pdf/jr/IJ1601.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The aftermath===
[[File:HiroshigeChushingura.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The ''rōnin'', on their way back to Sengaku-ji, are halted in the street, and invited in for rest and refreshment.]]
[[File:Femme-47-ronin-seppuku-p1000701.jpg|thumb|Women have their own ritual suicide, in which they slit their own throats. Here, the wife of Onodera Junai, one of the Forty-seven Rōnin, prepares for her suicide; note the legs tied together, a female feature of seppuku to ensure a "decent" posture in death]]
As day was now breaking, they quickly carried Kira's head from his residence to their lord's grave in [[Sengaku-ji]] temple, marching about ten kilometers across the city, causing a great stir on the way. The story of the revenge spread quickly, and everyone on their path praised them and offered them refreshment.&lt;ref&gt;Mitford, pp. 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

On arriving at the temple, the remaining 46 ''rōnin'' (all except Terasaka Kichiemon) washed and cleaned Kira's head in a well, and laid it, and the fateful dagger, before Asano's tomb. They then offered prayers at the temple, and gave the abbot of the temple all the money they had left, asking him to bury them decently, and offer prayers for them. They then turned themselves in; the group was broken into four parts and put under guard of four different ''daimyō''.&lt;ref&gt;Mitford, pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, two friends of Kira came to collect his head for burial; the temple still has the original receipt for the head, which the friends and the priests who dealt with them had all signed.&lt;ref name="Mitford, p. 30"/&gt;

The shogunate officials in Edo were in a quandary. The samurai had followed the precepts by avenging the death of their lord; but they had also defied the shogunate's authority by exacting revenge, which had been prohibited. In addition, the ''shōgun'' received a number of petitions from the admiring populace on behalf of the ''rōnin''. As expected, the ''rōnin'' were sentenced to death for the murder of Kira; but the ''shōgun'' finally resolved the quandary by ordering them to honorably commit ''seppuku'' instead of having them executed as criminals.&lt;ref name = "Mitford 28"&gt;Mitford, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; It is known that each of the assailants ended his life in a ritualistic fashion.&lt;ref name = "s91" /&gt; Ōishi Chikara, the youngest, was only 15 years old on the day the raid took place, and only 16 the day he committed ''seppuku''.

Each of the 46 ''rōnin'' killed himself in {{nihongo|''Genroku'' 16, on the 4th day of the 2nd month|元禄十六年二月四日||February 4, 1703}}.&lt;ref name="Tsuchihashi conversion"/&gt; This has caused a considerable amount of confusion ever since, with some people referring to the "forty-six rōnin"; this refers to the group put to death by the ''shōgun'', while the actual attack party numbered forty-seven. The forty-seventh ''rōnin'', identified as Terasaka Kichiemon, eventually returned from his mission and was pardoned by the ''shōgun'' (some say on account of his youth). He lived until the age of 87, dying around 1747, and was then buried with his comrades. The assailants who died by ''seppuku'' were subsequently interred on the grounds of Sengaku-ji,&lt;ref name = "s91" /&gt; in front of the tomb of their master.&lt;ref name = "Mitford 28" /&gt;

The clothes and arms they wore are still preserved in the temple to this day, along with the drum and whistle; their armor was all home-made, as they had not wanted to arouse suspicion by purchasing any.

The tombs became a place of great veneration, and people flocked there to pray. The graves at the temple have been visited by a great many people throughout the years since the Genroku era.&lt;ref name = "s91" /&gt; One of those was the Satsuma man who had mocked and spat on Ōishi as he lay drunk in the street. Addressing the grave, he begged for forgiveness for his actions and for thinking that Ōishi was not a true samurai. He then committed suicide and was buried next to the ''rōnin''.&lt;ref name = "Mitford 28" /&gt;

===Re-establishment of the Asano clan's lordship===
Though the revenge is often viewed as an act of loyalty, there had been a second goal, to re-establish the Asanos' lordship and finding a place for their fellow samurai to serve. Hundreds of samurai who had served under Asano had been left jobless, and many were unable to find employment, as they had served under a disgraced family. Many lived as farmers or did simple handicrafts to make ends meet. The revenge of the forty-seven ''rōnin'' cleared their names, and many of the unemployed samurai found jobs soon after the ''rōnin'' had been sentenced to their honorable end.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Asano Daigaku Nagahiro, Naganori's younger brother and heir, was allowed by the Tokugawa shogunate to re-establish his name, though his territory was reduced to a tenth of the original.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Criticism==
The ''rōnin'' spent more than 14 months waiting for the "right time" for their revenge. It was [[Yamamoto Tsunetomo]], author of the ''[[Hagakure]]'', who asked the well known question: "What if, nine months after Asano's death, Kira had died of an illness?" His answer was that the forty-seven ''rōnin'' would have lost their only chance at avenging their master. Even if they had claimed, then, that their dissipated behavior was just an act, that in just a little more time they would have been ready for revenge, who would have believed them? They would have been forever remembered as cowards and drunkards—bringing eternal shame to the name of the Asano clan. The right thing for the ''rōnin'' to do, wrote Yamamoto, was to attack Kira and his men immediately after Asano's death. The ''rōnin'' would probably have suffered defeat, as Kira was ready for an attack at that time—but this was unimportant.&lt;ref name="Yamamoto, T 1979"&gt;[[Yamamoto Tsunetomo|Yamamoto, T.]] (Kodansha, 1979). ''[[Hagakure]]'', p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ōishi was too obsessed with success, according to Yamamoto. He conceived his convoluted plan to ensure that they would succeed at killing Kira, which is not a proper concern in a samurai: the important thing was not the death of Kira, but for the former samurai of Asano to show outstanding courage and determination in an all-out attack against the Kira house, thus winning everlasting honor for their dead master. Even if they had failed to kill Kira, even if they had all perished, it would not have mattered, as victory and defeat have no importance. By waiting a year, they improved their chances of success but risked dishonoring the name of their clan, the worst sin a samurai can commit.&lt;ref name="Yamamoto, T 1979"/&gt;

==In the arts==
{{Main|Chūshingura}}
[[File:Kuranosuke Harakiri no zu.jpg|thumb|260px|Painting of [[Ōishi Yoshio]] committing seppuku]]
The tragedy of the Forty-seven Rōnin has been one of the most popular themes in Japanese art, and has lately even begun to make its way into Western art.

Immediately following the event, there were mixed feelings among the intelligentsia about whether such vengeance had been appropriate. Many agreed that, given their master's last wishes, the ''rōnin'' had done the right thing, but were undecided about whether such a vengeful wish was proper. Over time, however, the story became a symbol of loyalty to one's master and later, of loyalty to the emperor. Once this happened, the story flourished as a subject of drama, storytelling, and visual art.

===Plays===
The incident immediately inspired a succession of ''[[kabuki]]'' and ''[[bunraku]]'' plays; the first, ''The Night Attack at Dawn by the Soga'', appeared only two weeks after the ronin died. It was shut down by the authorities, but many others soon followed, initially in [[Osaka]] and [[Kyoto]], farther away from the capital. Some even took the story as far as [[Manila]], to spread the story to the rest of Asia.

The most successful of the adaptations was a ''[[bunraku]]'' [[puppet]] play called ''[[Kanadehon Chūshingura]]'' (now simply called ''Chūshingura'', or "Treasury of Loyal Retainers"), written in 1748 by Takeda Izumo and two associates; it was later adapted into a ''kabuki'' play, which is still one of Japan's most popular.

In the play, to avoid the attention of the censors, the events are transferred into the distant past, to the 14th century reign of ''shōgun'' [[Ashikaga Takauji]]. Asano became En'ya Hangan Takasada, Kira became [[Kō no Moronao]] and Ōishi became Ōboshi Yuranosuke Yoshio; the names of the rest of the ''rōnin'' were disguised to varying degrees. The play contains a number of plot twists that do not reflect the real story: Moronao tries to seduce En'ya's wife, and one of the ''rōnin'' dies before the attack because of a conflict between family and warrior loyalty (another possible cause of the confusion between forty-six and forty-seven).

===Opera===
The story was turned into an opera, ''Chūshingura'', by [[Shigeaki Saegusa]] in 1997.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Cinema and television===
The play has been made into a movie at least six times in Japan,&lt;ref name="child2007"&gt;Child, Ben. [https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/dec/09/keanu-reeves-47-ronin "Keanu Reeves to play Japanese samurai in 47 Ronin",] ''The Guardian'' (London). December 9, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; the earliest starring [[Onoe Matsunosuke]]. The film's release date is questioned, but placed between 1910 and 1917. It has been aired on the Jidaigeki Senmon Channel (Japan) with accompanying ''[[benshi]]'' narration. In 1941, the Japanese military commissioned director [[Kenji Mizoguchi]], who would later direct ''[[Ugetsu]]'', to make ''[[The 47 Ronin (1941 film)|Genroku Chūshingura]]''. They wanted a ferocious morale booster based on the familiar ''rekishi geki'' ("historical drama") of ''The Loyal 47 Ronin''. Instead, Mizoguchi chose for his source ''Mayama Chūshingura'', a cerebral play dealing with the story. The film was a commercial failure, having been released in Japan one week before the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. The Japanese military and most audiences found the first part to be too serious, but the studio and Mizoguchi both regarded it as so important that Part Two was put into production, despite lukewarm reception to Part One. The film wasn't shown in America until the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.chicagoreader.com/movies/archives/0297/02077.html | title = Movies | publisher = Chicago Reader}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1962 film version directed by [[Hiroshi Inagaki]], ''[[Chushingura: Hana no Maki, Yuki no Maki|Chūshingura]]'', is most familiar to Western audiences.&lt;ref name="child2007"/&gt; In it, [[Toshirō Mifune]] appears in a supporting role as spearman Tawaraboshi Genba. Mifune was to revisit the story several times in his career. In 1971 he appeared in the 52-part television series ''[[Daichūshingura]]'' as Ōishi, while in 1978 he appeared as Lord Tsuchiya in the epic ''[[Swords of Vengeance]]'' (''Akō-jō danzetsu'').

Many Japanese television shows, including single programs, short series, single seasons, and even year-long series such as ''Daichūshingura'' and the more recent NHK [[Taiga drama]] ''Genroku Ryōran'', recount the events of the Forty-seven Rōnin. Among both films and television programs, some are quite faithful to the ''Chūshingura,'' while others incorporate unrelated material or alter details. In addition, ''[[gaiden]]'' dramatize events and characters not in the ''Chūshingura''. [[Kon Ichikawa]] directed [[47 Ronin (1994 film)|another version]] in 1994. In 2004, [[Kōsei Saitō|Mitsumasa Saitō]] directed a 9-episode mini-series starring [[Ken Matsudaira]], who also starred in a 1999 49-episode TV series of the ''Chūshingura'' entitled ''Genroku Ryōran''. In [[Hirokazu Koreeda]]'s 2006 film ''[[Hana (film)|Hana yori mo nao]]'', the events of the Forty-seven Rōnin story were used as backdrop, with one of the ronin being a neighbour of the protagonists.

Most recently, it was made into a 2013 American movie, titled ''[[47 Ronin (2013 film)|47 Ronin]]'', released on December 25, 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1335975/ | title = IMDB: 47 Ronin (2013)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then again into a more stylized version titled ''[[Last Knights]]'', released April 3, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2015/04/01/freeman-owen-casualties-of-bloody-bad-last-knights/|title=Freeman, Owen casualties of bloody bad 'Last Knights'|first=Sara|last=Stewart|date=1 April 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Woodblock prints===
The Forty-seven Rōnin is one of the most popular themes in [[woodblock printing|woodblock prints]], or ''[[ukiyo-e]]'' and many well-known artists have made prints portraying either the original events, scenes from the play, or the actors. One book on subjects depicted in woodblock prints devotes no fewer than seven chapters to the history of the appearance of this theme in woodblocks. Among the artists who produced prints on this subject are [[Utamaro]], [[Utagawa Toyokuni III|Toyokuni]], [[Hokusai]], [[Kunisada]], [[Hiroshige]], and [[Yoshitoshi]].&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, Andrew ; Henley, David (2012). ''Forty-Seven Ronin: Tsukioka Yoshitoshi Edition''. Chiang Mai: Cognoscenti Books. ASIN: B00ADQGLB8&lt;/ref&gt; However, probably the most widely known woodblocks in the genre are those of [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi|Kuniyoshi]], who produced at least eleven separate complete series on this subject, along with more than twenty [[triptych]]s.

===Literature===
* The earliest known account of the Akō incident in the West was published in 1822 in [[Isaac Titsingh]]'s posthumously-published book ''Illustrations of Japan''.&lt;ref name="s91"/&gt;

The name "Generation Jones" has several connotations, including a large [[Anonymity|anonymous]] generation, a "[[keeping up with the Joneses]]" competitiveness and the slang word "[[wikt:jones|jones]]" or "jonesing", meaning a yearning or craving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2009/jan/18/generation-jones-soon-have-its-man-washington/ |title='Generation Jones' soon to have its man in Washington |newspaper=Chattanooga Times Free Press| last=Anne |first=Braly |date=January 18, 2009}}

The generation is noted for coming of age after a huge swath of their older brothers and sisters in the earlier portion of the baby boomer population had come immediately preceding them; thus, many Generation Jones members complain that there was a paucity of resources and privileges available to them that were seemingly abundant to those older boomers born earlier. Therefore, there is a certain level of bitterness about and a "jonesing" for the level of freedom and affluence granted to older boomers but denied to their generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713115711/http://www.jonathanpontell.com/aboutgenjones.htm

The term has enjoyed some currency in political and cultural commentary, including during the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 United States presidential election]], where Generation Jonesers [[Barack Obama]] and [[Sarah Palin]] were on presidential tickets.

'''Government failure''', in the context of [[public economics]], is an [[economic inefficiency]] caused by a government intervention, if the inefficiency would not exist in a true [[free market]].&lt;ref&gt;Orbach, Barak (2013). "What Is Government Failure," ''Yale Journal on Regulation Online'', 30, pp. [http://ssrn.com/abstract=2219709 44-56.]&lt;/ref&gt; It can be viewed in contrast to a [[market failure]], which is an economic inefficiency that results from the free market itself, and can potentially be corrected through government regulation. The idea of government failure is associated with the policy argument that, even if particular markets may not meet the standard conditions of [[perfect competition]] required to ensure social optimality, government intervention may make matters worse rather than better.

As with a market failure, a government failure is not a failure to bring a particular or favored solution into existence but is rather a problem which prevents an efficient outcome.  The problem to be solved need not be a market failure; governments may act to create inefficiencies even when an efficient market solution is possible.

Government failure (by definition) does not occur when government action creates winners and losers, making some people better off and others worse off than they would be without governmental regulation. It occurs only when governmental action creates an inefficient outcome, where efficiency would otherwise exist. A defining feature of government failure is where it would be possible for everyone to be better off (a [[Pareto improvement]]) under a different regulatory environment. 

Examples of government failure include [[regulatory capture]] and [[Regulatory arbitrage#Regulatory arbitrage|regulatory arbitrage]]. Government failure may arise because of unanticipated consequences of a government intervention, or because an inefficient outcome is more politically feasible than a Pareto improvement to it. Government failure can be on both the [[demand]] side and the [[supply (economics)|supply]] side. Demand-side failures include preference-revelation problems and the illogics of voting and collective behaviour. Supply-side failures largely result from [[principal–agent problem]].&lt;ref&gt;Connolly, S. &amp; Munro, A. (1999). 'Public Choice', Chapter 8 in ''Economics of the Public Sector'', Pearson, Harlow, Essex.&lt;/ref&gt; Also Every other intervention of the government into the market ever was a failure and created ineficiency.

== History ==
The phrase "government failure" emerged as a term of art in the early 1960s with the rise of intellectual and political criticism of government regulations. Building on the premise that the only legitimate rationale for government regulation was [[market failure]], economists advanced new theories arguing that government interventions in markets were costly and tend to fail.&lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt; 

An early use of "government failure" was by [[Ronald Coase]] (1964) in comparing an actual and ideal system of [[regulatory economics|industrial regulation]]:&lt;ref&gt;Coase, Ronald (1964).

:Contemplation of an optimal system may provide techniques of analysis that would otherwise have been missed and, in certain special cases, it may go far to providing a solution. But in general its influence has been pernicious. It has directed economists’ attention away from the main question, which is how alternative arrangements will actually work in practice. It has led economists to derive conclusions for economic policy from a study of an abstract of a market situation. It is no accident that in the literature...we find a category "market failure" but no category "government failure." Until we realize that we are choosing between social arrangements which are all more or less failures, we are not likely to make much headway.

== Examples ==

=== Economic crowding out ===
[[Crowding out (economics)|Crowding out]] is the displacement of private sector investment by way of higher interest rates, when the government expands its borrowing to finance increased expenditure or tax cuts in excess of revenue. Government spending is also said to crowd out private spending by individuals.&lt;ref&gt;• [[Olivier Jean Blanchard|Blanchard, Olivier Jean]] (2008). "crowding out," ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd Edition. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_C000452&amp;edition=current&amp;q= Abstract.]&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • Shaghil Ahmed (1986). "Temporary and Permanent Government Spending in an Open Economy," ''Journal of Monetary Economics'', 17(2). pp.&amp;nbsp;197–224)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regulatory ===
[[Regulatory arbitrage#Regulatory arbitrage|Regulatory arbitrage]] is a regulated institution's taking advantage of the difference between its real (or economic) risk and the regulatory position.&lt;ref&gt;• [[Stephen Breyer]] (1979). "Analyzing Regulatory Failure: Mismatches, Less Restrictive Alternatives, and Reform," ''Harvard Law Review'', 92(3), pp. [http://www.uiowa.edu/~c030137/breyer.pdf 547-609]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;• [[Joseph E. Stiglitz]] (2009). "Regulation and Failure," in David Moss and John Cisternino (eds.), ''New Perspectives on Regulation'', ch. 1, pp. [http://tobinproject.org/sites/tobinproject.org/files/assets/New_Perspectives_Ch1_Stiglitz.pdf 11-23.] Cambridge: The Tobin Project.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Regulatory capture]] is the co-opting of regulatory agencies by members of or the entire regulated industry.  [[Rent seeking]] and [[rational ignorance]] are two of the mechanisms which allow this to happen.

Regulatory risk is the risk faced by private-sector firms that regulatory changes will hurt their business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/research/Economics/alphabetic.cfm?LETTER=R#REGULATORY%20RISK |title=Regulatory risk |publisher=Economist.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander Hamilton of the [[World Bank Institute]] argued in 2013 that rent extraction positively correlates with government size even in stable democracies with high income, robust rule of law mechanisms, transparency, and media freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|last1=Alexander|first1=Hamilton|date=2013|url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2013/01/07/000158349_20130107132037/Rendered/PDF/wps6305.pdf|title=Small is Beautiful, at Least in High-Income Democracies: The Distribution of Policy-Making Responsibility, Electoral Accountability, and Incentives for Rent Extraction|publisher=The World Bank Institute|id=Policy Research Working Paper 6305|quote=This paper hopes to contribute towards an explanation of these empirical regularities by developing and testing a new contextually enriched career concerns model of the political economy of public policy-making.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5187">The '''Greek community in Ethiopia''' today numbers about 500 persons and can be traced back to ancient times. It is mainly located in the capital, [[Addis Ababa]], and the city of [[Dire Dawa]].

==History==

The name [[Ethiopia]] itself is Greek and means "of burned face".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%232329|first=Henry George|last=Liddell|first2=Robert|last2=Scott|title=A Greek-English Lexicon|edition=Online |publisher=Tufts University|accessdate=2009-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is first attested in the Homeric epics but it is unlikely to have referred to any particular nation, but rather, to people of African descent in general. The Greek community in Ethiopia is first attested by the presence of craftsmen and sailors in the 18th century (1740) in what was then [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]], who played a part in the commerce between the country and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Natsoulas |first=Theodoros |title=The Greeks in Ethiopia: Economic, Political and Social Life, c,1740-1936 |series=Ph.D. dissertation |publisher=Syracuse University |year=1975 |oclc=8152015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Dombrowski |first=Franz Amadeus |title=Ethiopia's access to the sea |publisher=E.J. Brill |location=Leiden |year=1985 |pages=43 |isbn=90-04-07680-8 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The explorer [[James Bruce]] reported that a number of Greek refugees from [[Smyrna]] arrived in [[Gondar]] during the reign of the Emperor [[Iyasu II of Ethiopia|Iyasu II]], who included twelve silversmiths, whom the emperor put to work producing a variety of items for both his court and the churches of Gondar.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Silverman and Neal Sobania, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4128531 "Mining a Mother Lode: Early European Travel Literature and the History of Precious Metalworking in Highland Ethiopia", ''History in Africa'', 31 (2004), p. 348]&lt;/ref&gt;

The community saw its heyday in the early part of the 20th century with the establishment of the Holy Metropolis of Axum by the [[Patriarchate of Alexandria]] in 1908 and of the Greek organizations in Addis Ababa (1918) and Dire Dawa (1921).&lt;ref name=gmfa&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.mfa.gr/www.mfa.gr/en-US/Policy/Geographic+Regions/Sub-Saharan+Africa/Bilateral+Relation/Ethiopia/|title=Bilateral Relations Between Greece And Ethiopia|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs |publication-place=Greece |accessdate=2009-01-02|last=
|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present Situation==

In the post-war period the community grew to 3,000 persons. It suffered during the [[Ethiopian Civil War|revolution]] that overthrew [[Haile Selassie]] in 1974, when the hostility of the [[Derg]] towards all foreign communities drastically reduced its size to the current population of about 500.&lt;ref name=gmfa/&gt;

Today there is still a Greek school located in the capital as well as a Greek Orthodox church in the same city (St. Froumendios). The school has about 120 students, many of whom receive scholarships to continue their studies in Greece.&lt;ref name=aus&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.ausgreeknet.com/ethiopia.htm|title=Greeks in Ethiopia|publisher=AusGreekNet.com
|accessdate=2009-01-02|last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However there is an increasing initiative by Greeks to take advantage of the investment opportunities currently available in Ethiopia.&lt;ref name=emfa&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.ethiopianembassy.gr/bilateralRelations6.html|chapter=VI.

{{Jews and Judaism sidebar}}

'''The history of the Jews in Jamaica''' predominantly dates back to migrants from [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]] to the island since 1494.

==History==
{{further|Jewish pirates}}
The first Jews came to the island during the Spanish occupation of the Island, 1494-1655.
They came from Spain and Portugal, having fled the Spanish inquisition. To conceal their identity they referred to themselves as "Portuguese" or "Spanish" and practiced their religion secretly. At the time of the [[Invasion of Jamaica|British conquest of the island in 1655]], General Venables recorded the presence of many "Portuguese" in Jamaica. The Jews were allowed to remain after the conquest and began to practice their religion openly. They were granted British citizenship by Cromwell and this was confirmed in 1660 by King Charles. They attained full political rights in 1831. The status of British citizenship enabled ownership of property by the Jews. 

Jamaica's Jewish population was never large. However, their contribution to the economic and commercial life of the nation has been significant.{{fact|date=March 2017}}

===Modern times===
It was formerly believed that only 200 people were religiously practising Jews in Jamaica and that most Jews had migrated out of Jamaica. A recent study has now estimated that nearly 424,000 Jamaicans are descendants of Jewish ([[Sephardic]]) immigrants to Jamaica from Portugal and Spain from 1494 to the present, either by birth or ancestry. Jewish documents, gravestones written in [[Hebrew]] and recent [[DNA testing]] have proven this. While many are non-practicing, it is recorded that over 20,000 Jamaicans religiously identify as Jews. 

Common Jewish surnames in Jamaica are Abrahams, Alexander, Isaacs, [[Levy (surname)|Levy]], Marish, Lindo, Lyon, Sangster, Myers, Da Silva, De Souza, De [[Cohen (surname)|Cohen]], De Leon, DeMercado, Barrett, Babb, Magnus, Codner, DeCosta, [[Henriques (surname)|Henriques]] and Rodriques.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jamaica-gleaner.com/pages/history/story0054.htm Rebecca Tortello, "Out Of Many Cultures: The People Who Came - The Jews In Jamaica".]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Chabad-Lubavitch]] movement opened a branch in Jamaica in 2014 servicing locals as well as a welcome centre for international visitors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/news/article_cdo/aid/2706138/jewish/Just-in-Time-for-the-Holidays-Jamaica-Lands-Permanent-Chabad-Presence.htm, "Just in Time for the Holidays, Jamaica Lands Permanent Chabad Presence".]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institutions===
The BBC BackaBush Institute, first built in 1885, was the only synagogue in the country until 2014 when [[Chabad]] opened a second synagogue in Montego Bay. The congregation has their own [[siddur]], blending together Spanish-Portuguese tradition and [[Liberal Judaism (United Kingdom)| British Liberal]] and [[Reform Judaism|American Reform]] liturgy. The Hillel Academy, a private school  founded by the Jewish community, today is non-denominational but still serves as a meeting place for the children of the Jewish community. A Jamaican Jewish Heritage Center opened in 2006 in celebration of 350 years of Jews living in Jamaica. At least 21 Jewish cemeteries also exist in the country.&lt;ref name="bh.org.il"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Jews of Jamaica |url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/jamaica |publisher=The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the data given by the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]], worldwide, 78.7% of homicide victims are male, and in 193 of the 202 listed countries or regions, males were 
more likely to be killed than females. In two, the ratio was 50:50 ([[Switzerland]] and [[British Virgin Islands]]), and in the remaining 7; [[Tonga]], [[Iceland]], [[Japan]], [[New Zealand]], [[Republic of Korea]], [[Latvia]] and [[Hong Kong]], females were slightly more likely to be victims of homicides compared to males.&lt;ref name="UNDOC1"/&gt; A 2013 global study on homicide by the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] found that males accounted for about 96 percent of all homicide perpetrators worldwide &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.unodc.org/documents/gsh/pdfs/2014_GLOBAL_HOMICIDE_BOOK_web.pdf|title = Global Study on Homicide|date = 2013|accessdate = |website = www.unodc.org|publisher = United National Office of Drugs and Crime (Vienna)|last = Gibbons|first = Jonathan}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 79% of the victims (see the chart below).

The '''Kavli Prize''' was established in 2005 through a joint venture between the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]], the [[Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research]], and [[Kavli Foundation (United States)|The Kavli Foundation]]. The main objective for the Prize is to honor, support and recognize scientists for outstanding scientific work in the fields of [[astrophysics]], [[nanoscience]] and [[neuroscience]] and award three international prizes every second year. The Kavli Prize was awarded the first time in Oslo, 9 September 2008.  The Prizes were presented by [[Haakon, Crown Prince of Norway]].  Each of the three Kavli Prizes consists of a gold medal, a scroll, and a cash award of US $1,000,000.

==Selection committees==

The Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters appoints the three Prize Committees consisting of leading international scientists after receiving recommendations made by the following international academies and equivalent scientific organisations:

*[[Chinese Academy of Sciences|The Chinese Academy of Sciences]]
*[[French Academy of Sciences|The French Academy of Sciences]]
*[[Max Planck Society|The Max Planck Society (Germany)]]
*[[United States National Academy of Sciences|The National Academy of Sciences (US)]]
*[[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters|The Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]]
*[[The Royal Society|The Royal Society (UK) ]]

These distinguished panels of international scientist’s reviews and recommend the prize winners on basis of a nomination process. The Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters administer the selection process and announce the prize winners.

'''Streets named after Martin Luther King Jr.''' can be found in many cities of the [[United States]] and in nearly every major [[metropolis]].  There are also a number of other countries that have honored [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], including Italy and Israel. The number of streets named after King is increasing every year, and about 70% of these streets are in Southern states: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Texas. King's home state of Georgia had the most, with 75 streets as of 2001;&lt;ref name=GAstreet&gt;{{cite web |title=Martin Luther King Jr. Streets in Georgia |work=The New Georgia Encyclopedia |url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-802 |accessdate=1 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; this had increased to 105 as of 2006.&lt;ref name=w-sj/&gt;

As of 2003, there were over 600 American cities that had named a street after King.&lt;ref name=GAstreet/&gt;  By 2004, this number had grown to 650, according to [[National Public Radio|NPR]].&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{cite web|title=Along Martin Luther King|work=NPR.org|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1602178|accessdate=2006-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2006, Derek Alderman, a cultural geographer at East Carolina University, reported the number had increased to 730, with only 11 states in the country without a street named after King (Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, and Vermont).&lt;ref name=w-sj&gt;{{cite news |title=King's Way: Snapshots of life along Martin Luther King Jr. Drive|work=[[Winston-Salem Journal]]|url=http://extras.journalnow.com/flash/mlk/|accessdate=2009-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 he estimated that there were over 900 streets named after King in 41 states, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citylab.com/cityfixer/2015/11/the-remaking-of-martin-luther-king-streets/415449/ |title=The Ongoing Fight to Revitalize Streets Named After Martin Luther King |author=Tanvi Misra |work=CityLab |accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirteen cities have freeways named after Dr. King: Staten Island, New York; Jacksonville Florida; Norfolk, Virginia; Fayetteville, North Carolina; Louisville, Kentucky; Memphis, Tennessee; Akron, Ohio; Tulsa, Oklahoma; Fort Worth, Texas; Colorado Springs, Colorado; San Diego, California; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (Bucks County); and Camden, New Jersey.

It is held on the street between [[Crenshaw Boulevard]] and [[Western Avenue (Los Angeles)|Western Avenue]] either turning point at the [[Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza]] shopping mall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsday.com/news/nationworld/wire/la-me-parade15jan15,0,4611971.story|title=National &amp; World News on Newsday.com - Newsday|work=Newsday|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the length of Dr. King's name, the roadway name is often abbreviated as ''King Blvd.'' on its traffic signs and sometimes called ''MLK'' Blvd.  Another Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard (formerly Century Boulevard) exists in nearby [[Lynwood, California]]. There also exists Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue in [[Long Beach, California]].

At the eastern terminus it follows the south edge of Bluff Lake Nature Park and then turns south, becoming Moline Street. Its eastern terminus is within the Denver suburb of [[Aurora, Colorado]].

==Connecticut==

* New Haven: Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, formerly North Frontage Road, is a westward one-way main entrance into New Haven, home of [[Yale University]].

On January 19, 2013, the city of [[Dover, Delaware|Dover]] renamed Court Street, Duke of York Street, and William Penn Street near Delaware Legislative Hall to Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. Originally [[Delaware Route 8]] (Division Street) was to be renamed Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, but merchants opposed.&lt;ref name=post11913&gt;{{cite news|last=Prado|first=Antonio|title=Dover dedicates new Martin Luther Jr. King Boulevard at Legislative Mall|work=Dover Post|date=January 19, 2013|accessdate=June 7, 2013|url=http://www.doverpost.com/article/20130119/NEWS/130119747#axzz2VXvNpECV}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Wilmington: Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard connects Lancaster Avenue to Front Street, traveling from [[Interstate 95 in Delaware|I-95]] to the Wilmington Amtrak Station at [[U.S. Route 13 in Delaware|US&amp;nbsp;13]]. It provides a gateway for the New Castle County suburbs to Wilmington's waterfront, downtown, and the transit hubs from I-95. Eastbound (inbound) lanes connect with Lancaster Avenue, and are therefore able to draw from both exit 6 off of I-95, and the surrounding urban neighborhoods of Wilmington that lie west of downtown. Westbound (outbound) lanes of MLK Jr. Boulevard terminate at, and merge directly with I-95, providing a direct link between city and highway only. Wilmington Boulevard was renamed Martin Luther King Boulevard in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaroads.com/delaware/walkabout_i-095.htm ''Delaware Highways''] AA roads, Retrieved 6 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7155">'''Martin Edward Gurule''' (November 7, 1969 - November 27, 1998) was an [[United States|American]] prisoner who, in 1998, successfully escaped from [[death row]] in [[Texas]]. It was the first successful breakout from Texan death row since [[Raymond Hamilton]] was broken out by [[Bonnie and Clyde]] on January 16, 1934.

== Life ==
Martin Gurule was a [[Latino]] who was raised by his father and grandmother. His mother died shortly before his first birthday. He attended [[W. B. Ray High School]] in [[Corpus Christi, Texas|Corpus Christi]] and cared for intellectually disabled patients at [[Texas state supported living centers|Corpus Christi State School]], an institution run by the Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation. His 23-year-old girlfriend, Malisa Smith, worked on the checkout at the U &amp; I restaurant in Corpus Christi.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/28/us/texas-death-row-inmate-pulls-off-escape.html|title=Texas Death Row Inmate Pulls Off Escape|last=Lyman|first=Rick|date=1998-11-28|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-01-16|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crimes ==
On October 12, 1992, Gurule entered U &amp; I late at night and fatally shot restaurant co-owner Mike Piperis and employee Anthony Staton. Gurule claimed that Piperis had ordered him to come to the restaurant that night because Piperis wanted to discuss an accusation of Gurule committing [[Tax evasion in the United States|tax evasion]]. Then, Gurule claimed, Piperis attacked him and Gurule used his firearm in [[Right of self-defense|self-defense]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/dec/04/news/mn-50595|title=Escaped Death Row Inmate Found Dead|last=KOLKER|first=CLAUDIA|date=1998-12-04|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-01-16|last2=HART|first2=LIANNE|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigators contradicted Gurule's version of events. They alleged that Staton was sitting on a chair when he was shot in the back of the head. Piperis was found kneeling against a chair in front of an open [[safe]], and had also been shot in the back of the head. It was also discovered that Gurule's girlfriend, Malisa Smith, had been fired from her job at the restaurant in the week before the killings. The prosecution alleged that Gurule and Smith had jointly planned to rob the restaurant. It was also noted that Gurule had convictions dating back to 1986 for [[credit card fraud]], theft and two robberies. [[Nueces County, Texas|Nueces County]] [[District attorney|District Attorney]] Carlos Valdéz called the killings a "crime that had had been building up over several years".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In July 1993, Martin Gurule was convicted of first degree murder and [[Capital punishment in Texas|sentenced to death]], while Smith was sentenced to 25 years in jail. Gurule was transferred to the [[Ellis Unit|Elis Unit]] in an [[unincorporated area]] of [[Walker County, Texas|Walker County]]. It is the only unit in Texas that has death row for male inmates. Gurule was selected for the Work Capable Program, together with around 150 other death row inmates. This was a trial program that allowed selected death row inmates to move relatively freely outside their cells, to have contact with other non-death row inmates and to carry out supervised work within the prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/1997/07/shadow-figures-portrait-life-texas-death-row/|title=Shadow Figures: A Portrait of Life on Texas Death Row|work=Mother Jones|access-date=2018-01-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; His appeal against the death penalty was denied a year before his escape.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/04/us/death-row-escapee-found-dead.html|title=Death Row Escapee Found Dead|last=Lyman|first=Rick|date=1998-12-04|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-01-16|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Escape ==
During a [[Thanksgiving dinner]] on November 26, 1998, Martin Gurule and six other death row inmates hid in a [[recreation room]]. Prior to leaving their cells for the dinner, they had placed cushions and sheets in their beds in such a way that the guards would not suspect anything was amiss. They also darkened their prison uniforms with [[marker pen]]s so that they would be less visible at night. After the cells were locked for the night, they broke through a door to the recreational yard and then through a separating fence. Once they reached the main prison yard, they scaled the roof of a building and waited for complete darkness.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Shortly after midnight, guards at a post spotted the escapees climbing, immediately raising the alarm and opening fire. At this point, all six of Gurule's co-escapees surrendered, but Gurule ran approximately 100&amp;nbsp;ft over an open piece of land, scaled a [[Barbed wire|barbed-wire]] fence, ran another 70&amp;nbsp;ft across a clearing, scaled a second barbed-wire fence and disappeared into the darkness outside the prison boundary, despite the guards firing 18 shots at him.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

More than 500 officers from surrounding towns, cities and counties took part in the manhunt, which was supported by [[Detection dog|sniffer dogs]], boats and helicopters. [[Governor of Texas|Governor]] [[George W. Bush]] additionally called in the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]] and announced a 5,000-dollar reward for information leading to Gurule's capture.

Seven days later, two fishermen found Gurule's body in a tributary of the [[Trinity River (Texas)|Trinity River]] near [[Huntsville, Texas|Huntsville]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Gurule was wearing several layers of clothing and rolled up newspapers and cardboard to protect him while scaling the prison's barbed-wire fences. The autopsy revealed that he had sustained a gunshot in the back, causing him to [[Drowning|drown]] in the river. His time of death was backdated to November 27, meaning that he died on the night of his escape. Investigators believe that he jumped into the river to remove traces that could allow sniffer dogs to locate him, and then drowned due to the severity of his gunshot wound preventing him from being able to get out of the river.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As a direct result of Gurule's escape, the [[Texas Department of Criminal Justice]] relocated its death row in March 1999 to the Terrell Unit (now renamed the [[Allan B. Polunsky Unit]]), in [[West Livingston, Texas|West Livingston]], [[Polk County, Texas|Polk County]]. The Work Capable Program was discontinued.

== Co-escapees ==
* Eric Dewayne Cathey (27), on death row since 1997
* James Edward Clayton (32), executed May 25, 2000
* Henry Earl Dunn (24), executed February 6, 2003

[[File:Melvin Charney Jardin de sculptures.jpg|thumb|Charney's sculpture garden at the Canadian Centre for Architecture]]
[[File:Montreal Berri-UQAM.jpg|thumb|''Skyscraper, Waterfall, Brooks — A Construction'']]
He was born in 1935, and grew up in a working-class family in [[The Plateau]] neighbourhood of Montreal, the eldest of three sons of Hyman and Fanny Charney. Fanny was originally from what is now [[Belarus]], and worked in a sewing factory. Hyman Charney was from Poland, and worked as a paint salesman as well as an accomplished woodworker and decorator, creating doors for synagogues and churches. Hyman was also interested in visual arts, and from a young age, Melvin took Saturday classes at the [[Montreal Museum of Fine Arts]]. Later in his childhood the family was able to afford to move to the edge of [[Outremont]].&lt;ref name=GlobeObit&gt;{{cite news|author=Fitterman, Lisa|date=29 September 2012|title='He made evident what is evident': Montreal artist believed architectural designs should be created with an understanding of urban and social contexts|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|page=S12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He studied architecture at [[McGill University]] and [[Yale University]], and worked in Paris and New York before returning to Montreal in 1964, where he opened his architecture practice and began teaching at the [[Université de Montréal]].&lt;ref name=Curran&gt;{{cite news|last=Curran|first=Peggy|title=Melvin Charney: A towering figure in Montreal architecture|url=https://montrealgazette.com/travel/towering+figure+Montreal+architecture/7268289/story.html|accessdate=22 September 2012|newspaper=[[Montreal Gazette]]|date=19 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120923004558/http://www.montrealgazette.com/travel/towering+figure+Montreal+architecture/7268289/story.html|archivedate=23 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Charney submitted a design for the Canadian pavilion at [[Expo 70]] which would be fashioned from construction cranes and scaffolding. His submission, while not successful, signalled Charney's shift away from building design to [[public art]]. His depiction of historic buildings demolished to make way for [[Expo 67]] and the [[Montreal Olympic Games]] in the short-lived [[Corrid’art]] exhibit is reported to be a primary reason why mayor [[Jean Drapeau]] ordered the exhibition demolished. Notable public art works by Charney in Montreal include the [[sculpture garden]] at the [[Canadian Centre for Architecture]] and the sculpture ''Skyscraper, Waterfall, Brooks — A Construction'' at [[Place Émilie-Gamelin]], both constructed after Drapeau left office.&lt;ref name=Curran/&gt;

In 2003, he was named a Chevalier (Knight) of the [[Ordre national du Québec]] for his outstanding accomplishments and contributions to the growth of Quebec. In 2006, he was named a Commandeur of the [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]] by the government of France for his contributions to culture.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; He was married to writer [[Ann Charney]].&lt;ref name=Curran/&gt;

The '''Montenegrins of Serbia''' ([[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]]: ''Crnogorci u Srbiji /'' Црногорци у Србији) are a [[national minority]] in the country. According to the 2011 census, there are 38,527&lt;ref&gt;http://popis2011.stat.rs/?lang=en&lt;/ref&gt; ethnic [[Montenegrins]] in [[Serbia]]. They are the sixth largest ethnic community in the [[Vojvodina]] province.

==Geography==

The largest concentration of Montenegrins in Vojvodina could be found in the municipalities of [[Vrbas (city)|Vrbas]] (24.79%), [[Mali Iđoš]] (20.83%), and [[Kula (Vojvodina)|Kula]] (16.34%). Settlements in Vojvodina with absolute or relative Montenegrin majority are: [[Lovćenac]] in the [[Mali Iđoš]] municipality with 56.86% Montenegrins, [[Kruščić]] in the [[Kula (Vojvodina)|Kula]] municipality with 32.64% Montenegrins, and [[Savino Selo]] in the [[Vrbas (city)|Vrbas]] municipality with 38.20% Montenegrins.

[[Image:Who needs a virtual world?.jpg|thumb|Contents of a needle-exchange kit]]

A '''needle and syringe programme''' ('''NSP'''), '''syringe-exchange programme''' ('''SEP'''), or '''needle exchange program''' ('''NEP''') is a [[social service]] that allows [[Injection (medicine)|injecting]] drug users (IDUs) to obtain [[hypodermic needle]]s and associated [[paraphernalia]] at little or no cost. It is based on the philosophy of [[harm reduction]] that attempts  to reduce the [[risk factor]]s for [[disease]]s such as [[HIV/AIDS]] and [[hepatitis]]. While NSPs provide most or all equipment free of charge, exchange programmes require service users to return used [[syringe]]s to receive an equal number of new syringes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Site Needle &amp; Syringe Program|url=http://ottawa.ca/en/residents/public-health/healthy-living/clean-needle-syringe-program|accessdate=6 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619133550/http://ottawa.ca/en/residents/public-health/healthy-living/clean-needle-syringe-program|archive-date=2013-06-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A comprehensive 2004 study by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) found a "compelling case that NSPs substantially and cost effectively reduce the spread of HIV among IDUs and do so without evidence of exacerbating injecting drug use at either the individual or societal level."&lt;ref name=Wodak2004&gt;{{cite web |title=Effectiveness of Sterile Needle and Syringe Programming in Reducing HIV/AIDS Among Injecting Drug Users |url=http://www.who.int/hiv/pub/prev_care/effectivenesssterileneedle.pdf|publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=18 July 2013|author1=Wodak, A. |author2=Cooney, A. |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; WHO's findings have also been supported by the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA), which in 2000 adopted a position strongly supporting NSPs when combined with addiction counseling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Yoast | first1 = R. | last2 = Williams | first2 = M.

== History and development ==

[[Image:Sharps container - cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Sharps container|"Sharps" container]] (for safe disposal of hypodermic needles)]]

Needle-exchange programmes can be traced back to informal activities undertaken during the 1970s. The idea is likely to have been rediscovered in multiple locations. The first government-approved initiative (Netherlands) was undertaken in the early to mid-1980s, followed closely by other initiatives. While the initial programme was motivated by an outbreak of [[hepatitis B]], the AIDS pandemic motivated the rapid adoption of these programmes around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Ritter, A and Cameron, J (2006)  A Systematic Review of Harm Reduction, Drug Policy Modeling Project, Monograph 06, Turning Point Alcohol and Drug Center, University of Melbourne, December.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Harm reduction ==

Harm reduction begins with the assumption that it is not reasonable to assume that individuals make healthy decisions. Advocates hold that those trapped in dangerous behaviors are often unable and/or unwilling to break free of them, and should at least be enabled to continue these behaviors in a less harmful manner.&lt;ref name=Souder2004&gt;{{cite web |last=Souder |first=Mark |title=Letter from Rep. Mark Souder to Dr. Elias A. Zerhouni, Director, National Institutes of Health |url=http://hepcproject.typepad.com/hep_c_project/2004/05/congressional_a.html |accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A tendency in the medical profession has been to treat [[drug dependency]] as a [[chronic illness]] like diabetes, [[hypertension]] and [[asthma]], to be treated, evaluated and even insured in like manner.&lt;ref name=NIDA2013&gt;{{cite web|title=Drugs, Brains, and Behavior: The Science of Addiction |url=http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/science-addiction/treatment-recovery |publisher=National Institute on Drug Abuse |accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FrontlinePBS&gt;{{cite web|title=Frontline: What is Addiction, and How Can We Treat It? |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/drugs/buyers/treatment.html |publisher=PBS |accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treating drug dependency as an illness absolves drug users of responsibility for their condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hoover.org/research/killing-them-softly|title=Killing Them Softly|last=Loconte|first=Joseph|date=1 July 1998|work=Hoover Institution|access-date=2018-08-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NEPs typically support the health and well-being of people who use drugs through awareness, education, and empowerment; for example, programs in Australia use the [[community development]] (CD) discipline as a basis for their work.&lt;ref name="mainlineneedleexchange.ca"&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome to Mainline Needle Exchange|url=http://www.mainlineneedleexchange.ca/index.html|work=Mainline|publisher=Mainline Needle Exchange|accessdate=16 July 2013|date=16 July 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810220210/http://www.mainlineneedleexchange.ca/index.html|archivedate=10 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peer education and needle &amp; syringe provision|url=http://www.hivpolicy.org/Library/HPP000360.pdf|work=Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations|publisher=AFAO|accessdate=16 July 2013|author=Dave Burrows}}&lt;/ref&gt; NEPs treat recreational drug use as a health issue and neither condemn nor condone the practice.&lt;ref name="mainlineneedleexchange.ca"/&gt; Some US states ordinarily require a prescription to buy needles and syringes, as they are considered drug paraphernalia rather than medical equipment. NEPs provide access in such areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hcvadvocate.org/hepatitis/hepC/needle_exchange.html Franciscus, A. (2003). Retrieved March 18, 2012, from] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130626094619/http://www.hcvadvocate.org/hepatitis/hepC/needle_exchange.html |date=June 26, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[National District Attorneys Association]] (NDAA)'s view is that denial of human agency offends common sense as well as criminal statutes, in that adults are responsible for their actions. Where individual decisions impact public health and welfare, criminal sanctions are appropriate and necessary.&lt;ref name=NDAA2005/&gt; Catholic Church doctrine asserts that harm reduction protocols treat persons as objects not in control of their own actions and gives the impression that certain types of irresponsible behavior have no moral content.&lt;ref name=CatholicCulture2011/&gt;
Former US President [[George W. Bush]] wrote: "Drug use in America, especially among children, increased dramatically under the Clinton-Gore Administration, and needle exchange programs signal nothing but abdication, that these dangers are here to stay. Children deserve a clear, unmixed message that there are right choices in life and wrong choices in life, that we are responsible for our actions, and that using drugs will destroy your life."&lt;ref name=Bush&gt;{{cite web |last=Bush|first=George W. |title=Response of Governor George W. Bush To the AIDS Foundation of Chicago |url=http://www.aidschicago.org/pdf/GWB_response.pdf |accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== HIV costs ==

It is estimated that the average annual cost of HIV care per person in the United States is [[United States dollar|US$]]15,745. Those with advanced HIV had an annual estimated cost of US$40,678.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contemporary Costs of HIV Health Care in the HAART Era|url=http://cds.johnshopkins.edu/hivrn/documents/posters/Gebo_IWOHD2009_Contemporary_Costs.pdf|work=Presentation for 13th International Workshop on HIV Observational Databases March 26–28, 2009 Lisbon, Portugal|publisher=HIV Research Network|accessdate=16 July 2013|author=KA Gebo|format=PDF|date=26–28 March 2009|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on when infection is detected and when the treatment process begins, it is estimated that, as of November 2006, the total lifetime healthcare costs of HIV care are between US$303,000 and $619,000.&lt;ref&gt;Schackman, B.

* In the U.S., the cost per needle at an NEP is approximately US$0.97, whereas the estimated cost of the daily dose of HIV medication, [[Truvada]], is US$36.&lt;ref name="cdc.gov"&gt;{{cite web|title=HIV/AIDS - Fact Sheets|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/topics/surveillance/resources/factsheets/us_overview.htm|work=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=16 July 2013|date=2 July 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501102910/http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/topics/surveillance/resources/factsheets/us_overview.htm|archivedate=1 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operation ==

In addition to sterile needles, syringe-exchange programmes typically offer services such as HIV and Hepatitis C testing; alcohol swabs; bleach water and [[normal saline]] (often as eye drops); aluminium "cookers"; citric acid powder (an imperative agent that enables [[heroin]] to dissolve in water); containers for needles and many other items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=North American Syringe Exchange Network|year=2000|title=2000 National Syringe Exchange Survey|publisher=Harm Reduction Coalition|url=http://www.harmreduction.org/research/dbase/survey2000/dataMain.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207001030/http://www.harmreduction.org/research/dbase/survey2000/dataMain.html|archivedate=2012-02-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey conducted by [[Beth Israel Medical Center]] in New York city and the [[North American Syringe Exchange Network]], among 126 surveyed SEPs that 77% provided material abuse therapy, 72% provided voluntary counselling and HIV testing, and more than two-thirds provided supplies such as bleach, alcohol pads and male and [[female condom]]s.

According to the [[Centers for Disease Control]] (CDC), around 1/5 of all new HIV infections and the vast majority of Hepatitis C infections are the result of injection drug use.&lt;ref name="United States 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Update:Syringe Exchange Programs |date=15 July 2005 |volume=54 |issue=27 |pages=673–6 |journal=MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep |publisher=United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5427a1.htm |pmid=16015218 |author1=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Needle-exchange programmes are supported by the CDC and the [[National Institute of Health]].&lt;ref name="United States 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="United States 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12407572 |journal=Hepatology |date=November 2002 |volume=36|issue=5 Suppl 1|pages=S3–20 |title=National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference Statement: Management of hepatitis C: 2002--June 10–12, 2002 |doi=10.1002/hep.1840360703 |last1=National Institutes Of |first1=Health}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NIH estimates that in the United States, between fifteen and twenty percent of injection drug users have HIV and at least seventy percent have hepatitis C.&lt;ref name="United States 2002"/&gt;

Proponents of harm reduction argue that the provision of a needle exchange provides a social benefit in reducing health costs and also provides a safe means to dispose of used syringes. For example, in the United Kingdom, proponents of SEPs assert that, along with other programs, they have reduced the spread of HIV among [[intravenous drug]] users.&lt;ref name=usiom2006&gt;{{cite web |author=Tilson, H. |year=2007 |publisher=United States Institute of Medicine |url=http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2006/Preventing-HIV-Infection-among-Injecting-Drug-Users-in-High-Risk-Countries-An-Assessment-of-the-Evidence.aspx |title=Preventing HIV Infection Among Injecting Drug Users in High-Risk Countries |accessdate=2010-01-09 |display-authors=etal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100801142925/http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2006/Preventing-HIV-Infection-among-Injecting-Drug-Users-in-High-Risk-Countries-An-Assessment-of-the-Evidence.aspx |archivedate=2010-08-01 |df= }} &lt;!-- This is from 2006. Isn't there something newer? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; These supposed benefits have led to an expansion of these programmes in most jurisdictions that have introduced them, increasing geographical coverage and operating hours. [[Vending machine]]s that automatically dispense injecting equipment "packs"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harmreduction.co.uk/products_for_exchange.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050206133339/http://www.harmreduction.co.uk/products_for_exchange.html |date=February 6, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have been successfully introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = McDonald | first1 = D. | title = The evaluation of a trial of syringe vending machines in Canberra, Australia | doi = 10.1016/j.drugpo.2008.06.004 | journal = International Journal of Drug Policy | volume = 20 | issue = 4 | pages = 336–339 | year = 2009 | pmid =  18790622| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Islam MM, Conigrave KM |year=2007 |title=Syringe vending machines as a form of needle syringe program: Advantages and Disadvantages |journal=Journal of Substance Use |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=203–12 |doi=10.1080/14659890701249640}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Islam MM, Stern T, Conigrave KM, Wodak A |title=Client satisfaction and risk behaviours of the users of syringe dispensing machines: a pilot study |journal=Drug Alcohol Rev. |date=January 2008 |volume=27|issue=1|pages=13–9 |doi=10.1080/09595230701711199 |pmid=18034377}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another advantage cited by program supporters is that SEPs protect both users and their support network such as attenders, sexual partners, children or neighbours. SEPs can also have an indirect influence to control transmission risks. Nurses are important for spreading knowledge about HIV among users. These programmes provide physical protection from HIV and facilitate education by teaching users about [[blood-borne pathogen]]s as well as how to protect themselves and others.

Other promoted benefits of these programmes include providing a first point of contact for formal drug treatment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brooner R, Kidorf M, King V, Beilenson P, Svikis D, Vlahov D |title=Drug abuse treatment success among needle exchange participants |journal=Public Health Rep. |volume=113 Suppl 1 |issue= Suppl 1|pages=129–39 |date=June 1998 |pmid=9722818 |pmc=1307735}}&lt;/ref&gt; access to health and counselling service referrals, the provision of up-to-date information about safe injecting practices, access to contraception and sexual health services and providing a means for data collection from users about their behaviour and/or drug use patterns. SEP outlets in some settings offer basic primary health care. These are known as 'targeted primary health care outlets', because they primarily target people who inject drugs and/or '[[Low-threshold treatment programs|low-threshold health care outlet]]s', because they reduce common barriers to health care from the conventional health care outlets,.&lt;ref name=IslamTopp2012&gt;{{cite journal |author=Islam, MM, Topp, L, Day, CA, Dawson, A and Conigrave, KM |title=The accessibility, acceptability, health impact and cost implications of primary healthcare outlets that target injecting drug users: A narrative synthesis of literature |journal=International Journal of Drug Policy |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=94–102 |year=2012 |pmid=21996165 |url=http://www.ijdp.org/article/S0955-3959(11)00159-9/abstract |doi=10.1016/j.drugpo.2011.08.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Islam, MM, Topp, L, Day, CA, Dawson, A and Conigrave, KM |title=Primary healthcare outlets that target injecting drug users: Opportunity to make services accessible and acceptable to the target group |journal=International Journal of Drug Policy |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=109–110 |year=2012 |pmid=22280917 |doi=10.1016/j.drugpo.2011.11.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clients frequently visit SEP outlets for help accessing sterile injecting equipment.

These services can take on a wide range of configurations:

* Primary needle and syringe programme ("stand alone" service)
* Secondary needle and syringe programme (such as incorporated within a pharmacy or health service)
* Mobile or on-call Service
* Dispensing machine distribution ("vending machine")
* Peer service: distribution networks
* Peer service: "flooding" or mass distribution
* Peer service: underground
* Prison-based facilities
* Distribution of bleach or other cleaning equipment (rather than needles and syringes)
* [[Ad hoc]] or informal distribution

== International experience ==

Countries where these programmes exist include: Australia, Brazil, Canada, the Czech Republic, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, United Kingdom, Ireland, Iran and the United States. In the United States such programmes may not receive federal funding, but this ban was briefly lifted in 2009 before being re-instated in 2010.&lt;ref name="Davis C, Beletsky L 2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Davis | first1 = C.

=== Australia ===

The Melbourne, Australia inner-city suburbs of Richmond and [[Abbotsford, New South Wales|Abbotsford]] are locations in which the use and dealing of heroin has been concentrated. The Burnet Institute research organisation completed the 2013 'North Richmond Public Injecting Impact Study' in collaboration with the Yarra Drug and Health Forum and North Richmond Community Health Centre and recommended 24-hour access to sterile injecting equipment due to the ongoing "widespread, frequent and highly visible" nature of illicit drug use in the areas. Between 2010 and 2012 a four-fold increase in the levels of inappropriately discarded injecting equipment was documented for the two suburbs. In the surrounding City of Yarra, an average of 1,550 syringes per month were collected from public syringe disposal bins in 2012. Paul Dietze stated, "We have tried different measures and the problem persists, so it's time to change our approach".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Syringe machine push for addicts in Melbourne's heroin hot spots|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/syringe-machine-push-for-addicts-in-melbournes-heroin-hot-spots/story-e6frg6n6-1226646482548|accessdate=20 May 2013|newspaper=The Australian|date=20 May 2013|author=Lucie Van Den Berg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 May 2013, the Burnet Institute stated that it recommended 24-hour access to sterile injecting equipment in the Melbourne suburb of [[Footscray, Victoria|Footscray]] after the area's drug culture continued to grow after more than ten years of intense law enforcement efforts. The Institute's research concluded that public injecting behaviour is frequent in the area and injecting paraphernalia has been found in carparks, parks, footpaths and drives. Furthermore, people who inject drugs have broken into syringe disposal bins to reuse discarded equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Drug experts propose needle vending machines for Footscray|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/leader/west/drug-experts-propose-needle-vending-machines-for-footscray/comments-fngnvmj7-1226651497633|accessdate=29 May 2013|newspaper=Herald Sun Maribyrnong Leader|date=28 May 2013|author=Bridie Byrne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British public body, the [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] (NICE), introduced a recommendation in April 2014 due to an increase in the number of young people who inject [[steroid]]s at UK needle exchanges. NICE previously published needle exchange guidelines in 2009, in which needle and syringe services were not advised for people under 18, but the organisation's director Professor Mike Kelly explained that a "completely different group" of people were presenting at programs. In the updated guidance, NICE recommended the provision of specialist services for “rapidly increasing numbers of steroid users”, and that needles should be provided to people under the age of 18—a first for NICE—following reports of 15-year-old steroid injectors seeking to develop their muscles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NICE: Needle exchanges should supply safe equipment to under-18 steroid users|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/nice-needle-exchanges-should-supply-safe-equipment-to-under18-steroid-users-9247087.html|accessdate=9 April 2014|newspaper=The Independent|date=9 April 2014|author=Charlie Cooper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 36 million syringes were distributed annually, mostly through large urban programs operating a stationary site.&lt;ref name="Green TC, Martin E, Bowman S, Mann M, Beletsky, L 2012 e9-e16"/&gt; More generally, US NEPs distribute syringes through a variety of methods including mobile vans, delivery services and backpack/pedestrian routes&lt;ref name="Des Jarlais DC, McKnight C, Goldblatt C, Purchase D. 2009 1441–6"/&gt; that include secondary (peer-to-peer) exchange.

The use of federal funds for needle-exchange programs was banned in 1988, but this ban was overturned in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sharon|first=Susan|title=Ban Lifted On Federal Funding For Needle Exchange|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121511681|accessdate=2011-03-25|newspaper=NPR|date=2009-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the time before the federal funding ban was re-instated in 2011, at least three programs were able to obtain federal funds and two thirds reported planning to pursue such funding.&lt;ref name="Green TC, Martin E, Bowman S, Mann M, Beletsky, L 2012 e9-e16"/&gt; A 1997 study estimated that while the funding ban was in effect, it "may have led to HIV infection among thousands of IDUs, their sexual partners, and their children."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lurie|first1=P|last2=Drucker|first2=E|title=An opportunity lost: HIV infections associated with lack of a national needle-exchange programme in the USA.|journal=The Lancet |date=1 March 1997|volume=349|issue=9052|pages=604–8|pmid=9057732|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(96)05439-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; US NEPs continue to be funded through a mixture of state and local government funds, supplemented by private donations.&lt;ref name="Des Jarlais DC, McKnight C, Goldblatt C, Purchase D. 2009 1441–6"/&gt; The funding ban was effectively lifted for every aspect of the exchanges except the needles themselves in the omnibus spending bill passed in December 2015 and signed by President Obama.

==== Legal aspects ====

Many states criminalized needle possession without a prescription, arresting people as they left private needle exchange facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Case P, Meehan T, Jones TS |title=Arrests and incarceration of injection drug users for syringe possession in Massachusetts: implications for HIV prevention |journal=J.

By 2012, legal syringe exchange programs existed in at least 35 states.&lt;ref name="Green TC, Martin E, Bowman S, Mann M, Beletsky, L 2012 e9-e16"/&gt; In some settings, syringe possession and purchase is decriminalized, while in others, authorized NEP clients are exempt from certain drug paraphernalia laws.&lt;ref name="Beletsky L, Grau LE, White E, Bowman S, Heimer R. 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Beletsky L, Grau LE, White E, Bowman S, Heimer R |title=The roles of law, client race and program visibility in shaping police interference with the operation of US syringe exchange programs. |journal=Addiction |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1360-0443.2010.03149.x/abstract?userIsAuthenticated=false&amp;deniedAccessCustomisedMessage= |accessdate=2012-07-05 |volume=106 |issue=2 |year=2011 |doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2010.03149.x |pmid=21054615 |pmc=3088513 |pages=357–365}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite the legal changes, gaps between the formal law and environment mean that many programs continue to face law enforcement interference&lt;ref name="Beletsky L, Burris S, Macalino GE. 2005 267–274"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Beletsky L, Burris S, Macalino GE |title=Attitudes of Police Officers Towards Syringe Access, Occupational Needle-Sticks, and Drug Use: A Qualitative Study of One City Police Department in the United States. |journal=International Journal of Drug Policy |ssrn=872756  |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=267–274 |year=2005 |doi=10.1016/j.drugpo.2005.01.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and covert programs continue to exist within the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lune, H |date=December 2002 |title=Weathering the Storm: Non-profit Organization Survival Strategies in a Hostile Climate |journal=Non-profit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly |volume=31 |issue=4 |pages=463–83 |doi=10.1177/0899764002238096}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colorado allows covert syringe exchange programs to operate. Current Colorado laws leave room for interpretation over the requirement of a prescription to purchase syringes. Based on such laws, the majority of pharmacies do not sell syringes without a prescription and police arrest people who possess syringes without a prescription.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gateway.nlm.nih.gov/MeetingAbstracts/ma?f=102187404.html]{{dead link|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volunteer-run groups such as The Works (Boulder) and The Underground Syringe Exchange of Denver (the USED) operate covertly to avoid prosecution and are entirely funded by donations. Due to the illegal nature of the organization, the USED website specifies that new clients must be referred in order to exchange syringes. According to The Works website, between January 2012 and March 2012, the group received over 45,000 dirty needles and distributed around 45,200 sterile syringes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bouldercounty.org/health/hpe/STI/exchange.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080606023305/http://www.bouldercounty.org/health/hpe/STI/exchange.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=6 June 2008 |title=Boulder County Public Health |publisher=Bouldercounty.org |accessdate=14 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Law enforcement ==

=== Extra-legal interference ===

Removal of legal barriers to the operation of NEPs and other syringe access initiatives has been identified as an important part of a comprehensive approach to reducing HIV transmission among IDUs.&lt;ref name="S Burris, D Finucane, H Gallagher, and J Grace 1996 1161–6"/&gt;  Legal barriers include both "law on the books" and "law on the streets," i.e., the actual practices of [[law enforcement]] officers,&lt;ref name="Beletsky L, Burris S, Macalino GE. 2005 267–274"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Burris, S., Blankenship, K. M., Donoghoe, M., Sherman, S., Vernick, J. S., Case, P.|title=Addressing the 'Risk Environment' for Injection Drug Users: The Mysterious Case of the Missing Cop. |journal=Milbank Quarterly |ssrn=937013 |accessdate=|volume=82 |pages=125–156 |year=2004 |doi=10.1111/j.0887-378x.2004.00304.x|display-authors=etal|pmc=2690204}}&lt;/ref&gt; which may or may not reflect relevant law. Changes in syringe and [[drug control policy]] can be ineffective in reducing such barriers if police continue to treat syringe possession as a crime or participation in NEP as evidence of criminal activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Beletsky L, Grau LE, White E, Bowman S, Heimer R |title=The roles of law, client race and program visibility in shaping police interference with the operation of US syringe exchange programs. |journal=Addiction |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1360-0443.2010.03149.x/abstract?userIsAuthenticated=false&amp;deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=  |accessdate=2012-07-05 |volume=106 |issue=2 |year=2011 |doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2010.03149.x |pmid=21054615 |pmc=3088513 |pages=357–365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although most US NEPs operate legally, many report some form of police interference.&lt;ref name="Beletsky L, Grau LE, White E, Bowman S, Heimer R. 2011"/&gt; In a 2009 national survey of 111 US NEP managers, 43% reported at least monthly client harassment, 31% at least monthly unauthorized confiscation of clients’ syringes, 12% at least monthly client arrest en route to or from NEP and 26% uninvited police appearances at program sites at least every 6 months. In multivariate modeling, legal status of the program (operating legally vs illegally) and jurisdiction’s syringe regulation environment were not associated with frequency of police interference.&lt;ref name="Beletsky L, Grau LE, White E, Bowman S, Heimer R. 2011"/&gt;  This finding confirms a substantial gap between law and law enforcement.

A detailed 2011 analysis of NEP client experiences in Los Angeles suggested that as many as 7% of clients report negative encounters with security officers in any given month. Given that syringes are not prohibited in the jurisdiction and their confiscation can only occur as part of an otherwise authorized arrest, almost 40% of those who reported syringe confiscation were not arrested. This raises concerns about extrajudicial confiscation of personal property. Approximately 25% of the encounters detailed by respondents involved private security personnel, rather than local police.&lt;ref name="Beletsky L, Sorensen A, Wagner K, Davidson P. 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Beletsky L, Sorensen A, Wagner K, Davidson P |title=The State of the Row: Syringe Exchange Client’s Experiences with Police and Private Security Personnel in Downtown Los Angeles. |journal=HHCLA |year=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar findings have emerged internationally. For example, despite instituting laws protecting syringe access and possession and adopting NEPs, IDUs and sex workers in Mexico’s Northern Border regions report frequent syringe confiscation by law enforcement personnel. In this region as well as elsewhere, reports of syringe confiscation are correlated with increases in risky behaviors, such as groin injecting, public injection and utilization of pharmacies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These practices translate&amp;nbsp;to risk for HIV and other blood-borne diseases.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Beletsky L, Lozada R, Gaines T, etal |title=Syringe confiscation as an HIV risk factor: the public health implications of arbitrary policing in Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico |journal=J.

=== Racial gradient ===

NEPs serving predominantly IDUs of color may be almost 4 times more likely to report frequent client arrest en route to or from the program and almost 4 times more likely to report unauthorized syringe confiscation.&lt;ref name="Beletsky L, Grau LE, White E, Bowman S, Heimer R. 2011"/&gt;  A 2005 study in Philadelphia found that African-Americans accessing the city's legally operated exchange decreased at more than twice the rate of white individuals after the initiation of a police anti-drug operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Davis CS, Burris S, Becher J, Lynch K, Metzger D |title=Effects of an Intensive Street-Level Police Intervention on Syringe Exchange Program Use in Philadelphia, PA |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=95 |issue=2 |year=2005 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2003.033563 |pmid=15671455 |pmc=1449157 |pages=233–236}}&lt;/ref&gt; These and other findings illustrate a possible mechanism by which racial disparities in law enforcement can translate into disparities in HIV transmission.&lt;ref name="Beletsky L, Sorensen A, Wagner K, Davidson P. 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Iguchi MY, Bell J, Ramchand RN, Fain T |title=How criminal system racial disparities may translate into health disparities. |journal=J.

These findings suggest that systematic surveillance and interventions are needed to address police interference.&lt;ref name="Beletsky L, Burris S, Macalino GE. 2005 267–274"/&gt;

=== Causes ===

Police interference with legal NEP operations may be partially explained by training defects. A study of police officers in an urban police department four years after the decriminalization of syringe purchase and possession in the US state of Rhode Island suggested that up to a third of police officers were not aware that the law had changed.&lt;ref name="Beletsky L, Burris S, Macalino GE. 2005 267–274"/&gt; This knowledge gap parallels other areas of public health law, underscoring pervasive gaps in dissemination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Burris S, Beletsky L, Burleson J, Case P, Lazzarini Z |title=Do Criminal Laws Influence HIV Risk Behavior? An Empirical Trial |journal=Arizona State Law Journal |ssrn=977274 |volume=2007 |issue=03 |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even police officers with accurate knowledge of the law, however, reported intention to confiscate syringes from drug users as a way to address problematic substance abuse.&lt;ref name="Beletsky L, Burris S, Macalino GE. 2005 267–274"/&gt; Police also reported anxiety about accidental needle sticks and acquiring communicable diseases from IDUs, but were not trained or equipped to deal with this occupational risk; this anxiety was intertwined with negative attitudes towards syringe access initiatives.

=== Training and interventions to address law enforcement barriers ===

US NEPs have successfully trained police, especially when framed as addressing police [[occupational safety]] and [[human resources]] concerns.&lt;ref name="Davis C, Beletsky L 2009"/&gt; Preliminary evidence also suggests that training can shift police knowledge and attitudes regarding NEPs specifically and public health-based approaches towards problematic drug use in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Beletsky L, Agrawal A, Moreau B, Kumar P, Weiss-Laxer N, Heimer R |title=Police training to align law enforcement and HIV prevention: preliminary evidence from the field.|journal=Am.

According to a 2011 survey, 20% of US NEPs reported training police during the previous year. Covered topics included the public health rationale behind NEPs (71%), police occupational health (67%), needle stick injury (62%), NEPs’ legal status (57%), and harm reduction philosophy (67%). On average, training was seen as moderately effective, but only four programs reported conducting any formal evaluation. Assistance with training police was identified by 72% of respondents as the key to improving police relations.&lt;ref name="Beletsky L, Grau LE, White E, Bowman S, Heimer R. 2011 145–149"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Beletsky L, Grau LE, White E, Bowman S, Heimer R |title=Prevalence, characteristics, and predictors of police training initiatives by US SEPs: Building an evidence base for structural interventions |journal=Drug and Alcohol Dependence |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376871611002602 |volume=119 |issue=1-2 |pages=145–149 |year=2011 |doi=10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2011.05.034|pmc=3192926 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disease transmission ===

Two 2010 ‘reviews of reviews’ by a team originally led by Norah Palmateer that examined [[systematic review]]s and [[meta-analysis|meta-analyses]] on the topic found insufficient evidence that NSP prevents transmission of the [[Hepatitis C virus]], tentative evidence that it prevents transmission of [[HIV]], and sufficient evidence that it reduces self-reported risky injecting behaviour.&lt;ref name="pmid20219055"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Palmateer N, Kimber J, Hickman M, Hutchinson S, Rhodes T, Goldberg D |title=Evidence for the effectiveness of sterile injecting equipment provision in preventing hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus transmission among injecting drug users: a review of reviews |journal=Addiction |volume=105 |issue=5 |pages=844–59 |date=May 2010 |pmid=20219055 |doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2009.02888.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a comment Palmateer warned politicians not to use her team's review of reviews as a justification to close existing programs or to hinder the introduction of new needle-exchange schemes. The weak evidence on the programs' disease prevention effectiveness is due to inherent design limitations of the reviewed primary studies and should not be interpreted as the programs lacking preventive effects.&lt;ref name=Norton2010&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/03/11/us-needle-exchange-idUSTRE62A4EC20100311 |title=Do needle-exchange programs really work? |author=Amy Norton |date=March 11, 2010 |work=Reuters Health |accessdate=October 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second of the Palmateer team's 'review of reviews' scrutinised 10 previous formal reviews of needle exchange studies,&lt;ref name=Kimber2010&gt;Kimber J, Palmateer N, Hutchinson S, Hickman M, Goldberg D, Rhodes T, EMCDDA Monograph 10 ‘Harm Reduction – Impacts, Evidences and Challenges,  Chapter 5 {{cite web |url=http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/monographs/harm-reduction |title=Harm reduction among injecting drug users — evidence of Effectiveness  |year=2010 |accessdate=July 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and after critical appraisal only four reviews were considered rigorous enough to meet the inclusion criteria.

NEPs successfully serve as one component of HIV prevention strategies.&lt;ref name=usiom2006/&gt; Multi-component HIV prevention programs that include NSE reduce drug-related HIV risk behaviors&lt;ref name=usiom2006/&gt; and enhance the impact of harm reduction services.&lt;ref name=Rhodes2010&gt;{{cite book|last=Rhodes|first=T.; Hedrich, D.|title=EMCDDA Monographs: Harm reduction: evidence, impacts and challenges|year=2010|publisher=European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction|isbn=978-92-9168-419-9|url=http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/attachements.cfm/att_101257_EN_EMCDDA-monograph10-harm%20reduction_final.pdf |chapter=Chapter 1: Harm reduction and the mainstream |accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tilson (2007) concluded that only comprehensive packages of services in multi-component prevention programs can be effective in reducing drug-related HIV risks. In such packages, it is unclear what the relative contribution of needle exchange may be to reductions in risk behavior and HIV incidence.&lt;ref name=usiom2006/&gt;

Multiple examples can be cited showing the relative ineffectiveness of needle exchange programs alone in stopping the spread of blood-borne disease.&lt;ref name=Wodak2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=usiom2006/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20219055"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kimber2010/&gt; Many needle exchange programs do not make any serious effort to treat drug addiction. For example, David Noffs of the Life Education Center wrote, "I have visited sites around Chicago where people who request info on quitting their habit are given a single sheet on how to go cold turkey -- hardly effective treatment or counseling."&lt;ref name=MoyersCloseToHome&gt;{{cite web |title=Q: Should needle exchange be publicly funded? |url=http://www.thirteen.org/closetohome/viewpoints/html/needle.html#noffs |publisher=PBS Online |accessdate=14 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130924094851/http://www.thirteen.org/closetohome/viewpoints/html/needle.html#noffs |archive-date=24 September 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 systematic review found support for the use of NEPs to prevent and treat HIV and HCV infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abdul-Quader|first1=Abu S.|last2=Feelemyer|first2=Jonathan|last3=Modi|first3=Shilpa|last4=Stein|first4=Ellen S.|last5=Briceno|first5=Alya|last6=Semaan|first6=Salaam|last7=Horvath|first7=Tara|last8=Kennedy|first8=Gail E.|last9=Des Jarlais|first9=Don C.|title=Effectiveness of Structural-Level Needle/Syringe Programs to Reduce HCV and HIV Infection Among People Who Inject Drugs: A Systematic Review|journal=AIDS and Behavior|date=22 August 2013|volume=17|issue=9|pages=2878–2892|doi=10.1007/s10461-013-0593-y|pmid=23975473}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 systematic review and meta-analysis found evidence that NEPs were effective in reducing HIV transmission among injection drug users, but that other harm reduction programs have probably also contributed to the decrease in HIV incidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aspinall|first1=EJ|last2=Nambiar|first2=D|last3=Goldberg|first3=DJ|last4=Hickman|first4=M|last5=Weir|first5=A|last6=Van Velzen|first6=E|last7=Palmateer|first7=N|last8=Doyle|first8=JS|last9=Hellard|first9=ME|last10=Hutchinson|first10=SJ|title=Are needle and syringe programmes associated with a reduction in HIV transmission among people who inject drugs: a systematic review and meta-analysis.|journal=International Journal of Epidemiology|date=February 2014|volume=43|issue=1|pages=235–48|doi=10.1093/ije/dyt243|pmid=24374889}}&lt;/ref&gt; NEPs appear to be as effective in low- and middle-income countries as in high-income ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Des Jarlais|first1=DC|last2=Feelemyer|first2=JP|last3=Modi|first3=SN|last4=Abdul-Quader|first4=A|last5=Hagan|first5=H|title=High coverage needle/syringe programs for people who inject drugs in low and middle income countries: a systematic review.|journal=BMC Public Health|date=19 January 2013|volume=13|pages=53|doi=10.1186/1471-2458-13-53|pmid=23332005|pmc=3567947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Worker training ===

Lemon and Shah presented a 2013 paper at the International Congress of Psychiatrists that highlighted lack of training for needle exchange workers and also showed the workers performing a range of tasks beyond contractual obligations, for which they had little support or training. It also showed how needle exchange workers were a common first contact for distressed drug users. Perhaps the most concerning finding was that workers were not legally allowed to provide [[Naloxone]] should it be needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lemon | first1 = T.

== Arguments for and against ==

=== Needle disposal ===

* NSPs that only replace used needles reduce improper needle discards and all NSPs safely dispose of exchanged needles.&lt;ref name=Franciscus2003&gt;{{cite web|last=Franciscus |first=Alan |title=Needle Exchange - A Matter of Public Health |url=http://www.hcvadvocate.org/hepatitis/hepC/needle_exchange.html |publisher=Hepatitis C Support Project |accessdate=20 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130626094619/http://www.hcvadvocate.org/hepatitis/hepc/needle_exchange.html |archivedate=26 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The few studies that specifically evaluated the effects of NEPs produced "modest" evidence of no impact on improper needle discards and injection frequency and "weak" evidence on lack of impact on numbers of drug users, high-risk user networks and crime trends.&lt;ref name=usiom2006/&gt;
* Many NSPs do not operate on a strict one-for-one basis, increasing supply of both contaminated and sterile needles.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}
* A 2003 Australian bi-partisan Federal Parliamentary inquiry published recommendations, registering concern about the lack of accountability of Australia’s needle exchanges, and lack of a national program to track needle stick injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Road to recovery: Report on the inquiry into substance abuse in Australian communities |publisher=Australian House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/House_of_Representatives_Committees?url=fca/subabuse/report.htm |accessdate=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community concern about discarded needles and needle stick injury led Australia to allocate $17.5 million in 2003/4 to investigating retractable technology for syringes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://melbourne-leader.whereilive.com.au/news/story/drug-injecting-hotspot-near-collingwood-childcare-centre/ |title=Drug-injecting hotspot near Collingwood childcare center |work=Melbourne Leader |date=8 March 2010 |accessdate=2010-05-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101023094044/http://melbourne-leader.whereilive.com.au/news/story/drug-injecting-hotspot-near-collingwood-childcare-centre/ |archivedate=23 October 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cost effectiveness ===

As of 2011, CDC estimated that every HIV infection prevented through a needle exchange program saves an estimated US$178,000+. Separately it reported an overall 30 percent or more reduction in HIV cases among IDUs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 22389572| pmc = 3291106| year = 2011| author1 = McLean| first1 = K| title = The biopolitics of needle exchange in the United States| journal = Critical Public Health| volume = 21| issue = 1| pages = 71–79| doi = 10.1080/09581591003653124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scope ===

* Although participants in a needle exchange program may experience reduced HIV incidence, they can still die of causes such as [[overdose]], collapsed veins, contaminated dope and street violence. Drug-addicted mothers will still deliver drug-addicted babies. Training drug addicts in safer injection protocols enables them to continue to support the violent and criminal drug trade.

The '''Night Wolves''' ({{lang-rus|Ночные Волки|r=Nochnye Volki}}) are a [[Russia]]n [[motorcycle club]].&lt;ref name=Romriell/&gt;

== History ==
The club began forming out of a mixture of rock music fans and motorcycle enthusiasts who held then-illegal rock concerts in [[Moscow]] (see [[Censorship in the Soviet Union]]) as far back as 1983.&lt;ref name=NWR/&gt; By 1989 the club was consolidated as an informal motorcycle group bearing the name "Night Wolves", during the [[Perestroika]] era of the [[Soviet Union]]. It became the first official bike club in the [[USSR]]. As of the beginning of 2018, the Night Wolves now have chapters in [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Latvia]], [[Germany]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Romania]], [[Serbia]], [[Australia]], [[Slovakia]], [[Belarus]], [[Philippines]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Montenegro]], [[Czech Republic]] and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]].&lt;ref name=Romriell/&gt; [[Alexander Zaldostanov]] (also known as The Surgeon) became the leader of the club in 1989.

The club runs multiple rock clubs and arranges many rock concerts in Russia. It also runs several tattoo parlors and is one of the founders of the annual International Moscow Tattoo Convention. In 1995, they launched a clothing line, "Wolf Wear," and established the "Wolf Engineering" custom shop subsidiary. It has gathered mechanics and general motorcycle enthusiasts from all across Russia, runs several motorcycle repair and custom shops and also developed the Wolf-Ural (Волк-Урал) motorcycle together with the manufacturer [[IMZ-Ural]].&lt;ref name=750cc/&gt; They usually ride [[Harley-Davidson]]s.&lt;ref name=LRB131010/&gt; Another subsidiary is the racing team "Wolf Racing" which was created in 2001 and participates in and organizes various events in Russia.

A member of the Night Wolves, Valery Bely, was shot and killed in a dispute with a rival biker club, Three Roads, in November 2012.&lt;ref name=TH121114/&gt; The head of [[Chechnya]], [[Ramzan Kadyrov]], joined the group in August 2014.&lt;ref name=MT141221/&gt; In May 2015, Zaldostanov inaugurated the group's Chechen branch in [[Grozny]] and named Kadyrov its honorary leader.&lt;ref name=MT150524/&gt;

The Night Wolves set up a compound in Slovakia near [[Bratislava]], not far from the Czech border, housing old tanks and armored vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-night-wolves-slovakia/29392527.html |title=Russia's Night Wolves Mark Territory In Slovakia |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=July 26, 2018 |website=[[RFERL.org]] |publisher= |access-date=July 27, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activism ==
The club has long taken an interest in the political and social life of Russia, engaging in youth social issues,{{which|date=April 2015}}{{how|date=May 2015}}&lt;ref name=OPRF2014 /&gt; forging close links to the [[Kremlin]] and establishing a friendship with President Putin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2015/04/25/an-ultra-nationalist-russian-biker-gang-is-invading-europe-and-poland-isnt-happy/ |work=The Washington Post |first=Rick |last=Noack |title=An ultra-nationalist Russian biker gang is invading Europe, and Poland isn't happy |date=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also contributed to the breaking away of Crimea by patrolling the streets of the peninsula with unmarked soldiers sent from Russia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qz.com/392315/poland-puts-a-stop-to-a-pro-putin-biker-gangs-european-invasion/|title=Poland puts a stop to a pro-Putin biker gang's European invasion|first=Hanna|last=Kozlowska|website=Qz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://time.com/11680/crimea-russia-putin-night-wolves/ |work=Time |first=Simon |last=Shuster |title=Russia Ups the Ante in Crimea by Sending in the 'Night Wolves' |date=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Teleg150317 /&gt; and fought for the pro-Russian side in the [[War in Donbass|Donbass war]].&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/25/poland-anti-russian-night-wolves-zaldostanov-motorcyclists-red-army|title=Poland's stance is 'anti-Russian hysteria', says Night Wolves leader|first=Alec|last=Luhn|date=25 April 2015|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are involved with the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] and make a motorcycle pilgrimage to holy Russian Orthodox sites several times a year.{{how|date=April 2015}}&lt;ref name=Mail120419 /&gt;

== Relationship with the Kremlin ==
The club has close ties to [[Vladimir Putin]] and a generally [[Russian nationalism|Russian nationalist]] sentiment.&lt;ref name=TH140302/&gt;&lt;ref name=LRB131010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Teleg150324/&gt; Putin has described them as his "friends" and appeared at their rallies, riding a Harley-Davidson trike.&lt;ref name=AFP150425/&gt; [[Yale University]] historian [[Timothy Snyder]] believes it serves "as a paramilitary and propaganda arm of the Putin regime."&lt;ref name="snyder140"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Snyder|first1=Timothy|authorlink=Timothy Snyder|title=[[The Road to Unfreedom: Russia, Europe, America]]|date=2018|publisher=The Bodley Head|location=London, U.K.|isbn=978-1-847-92526-8|page=140|quote=The public spectacle of the Russian invasion was provided by the Night Wolves, a Russian biker gang that served as a paramilitary and propaganda arm of the Putin regime.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Night Wolves are funded by the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]], receiving "several hundred million rubles a year" according to a report in 2013.&lt;ref name=LRB131010/&gt; In May 2015, [[Alexei Navalny]] claimed that the Russian government had given 56 million rubles to the group in the preceding year and a half.&lt;ref name=MT150506/&gt;&lt;ref name=RFE150505/&gt; In October 2015, Night Wolves received a donation of 12,000,000 rubles from the Russian government to 'build a "Patriot" youth center in Sevastopol in Crimea'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/russian-bikers-and-war-veterans-given-grants-for-patriotic-youth-centers/540203.html|title=Russian Bikers and War Veterans Given Grants for Patriotic Youth Centers|website=Themoscowtimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Involvement in Ukraine==
Members of the Night Wolves have fought on the side of pro-Russian militants during the [[Crimean Crisis]] and war in Donbass. They blockaded the main routes into Sevastopol&lt;ref name=GN140228 /&gt; and participated in attacks on a natural gas facility and the naval headquarters in the city.&lt;ref name=TH141221 /&gt; In April 2015, [[Agence France-Presse]] stated that Alexei Vereshchyagin had fought against Ukrainian government forces in [[Luhansk]].&lt;ref name=AFP150425 /&gt;

==Shows==
Their August 2014 show in [[Sevastopol]], supporting the [[annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexation of Crimea by Russia]] and depicting Ukraine as a country controlled by "fascists", was attended by an estimated 100,000 people and broadcast by Russian state television.&lt;ref name=RFE140811/&gt;&lt;ref name=BF140811/&gt;

During their New Year's shows for children, the Night Wolves portrayed the West as conspiring to destroy Russia.&lt;ref name=MT150506/&gt;&lt;ref name=RFE150505/&gt; In a January 2015 interview with ''[[RIA Novosti]]'', Zaldostanov stated that "When the kids come to us, we don't cut costs on special effects or efforts to convey to the children a feeling of true drive and danger."&lt;ref name=RFE150505/&gt;

== Sanctions ==

===Canada===
Canada added Zaldostanov to its sanctions list in February 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Government of Canada 17 Febr. 2015: : [http://news.gc.ca/web/article-en.do?nid=934699&amp;_ga=1.198933295.1671611780.1430298401 Expanded sanctions list], [http://www.international.gc.ca/sanctions/countries-pays/russia_regulations-russie_reglements.aspx?lang=eng&amp;_ga=1.134241521.1671611780.1430298401 Regulations Amending the Special Economic Measures (Russia) Regulations] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518092221/http://www.international.gc.ca/sanctions/countries-pays/russia_regulations-russie_reglements.aspx?lang=eng&amp;_ga=1.134241521.1671611780.1430298401# |date=2015-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CBC150219/&gt; The Night Wolves were included in June 2015.&lt;ref name=CA150629&gt;{{cite news |url= http://pm.gc.ca/eng/news/2015/06/29/expanded-sanctions-list |title= Expanded Sanctions List |website=Pm.gc.ca |date= 29 June 2015 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150820173127/http://pm.gc.ca/eng/news/2015/06/29/expanded-sanctions-list |archivedate= 20 August 2015 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany and Poland===
In 2015, when the Night Wolves were planning to celebrate the "[[Victory Day (9 May)|Victory Day]]" — victory over the [[Nazi Germany]] in the "[[Great Patriotic War]]" — on May 9 with a trip from Moscow to [[Berlin]], the government of Poland refused them entry due to the club members' active support of Putin, and [[Germany]] cancelled the bikers' Schengen visas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unian.info/world/1071128-polish-foreign-ministry-germany-cancels-russian-night-wolves-bikers-schengen-visas.html|title=Polish Foreign Ministry: Germany cancels Russian Night Wolves bikers' Schengen visas|website=Unian.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32452276|title=Poland bars Putin-backed bikers|date=24 April 2015|website=Bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On their way to Berlin, despite visa issues, Night Wolves commemorated the deaths of Polish officers murdered by NKVD in Katyn by lighting candles in their name on 26 April,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/wiadomosci/1,114881,17817959,Nocne_Wilki_oddaly_hold_pomordowanym_w_Katyniu_polskim.html|title=Nocne Wilki oddały hołd pomordowanym w Katyniu polskim oficerom |website=Wiadomosci.gazeta.pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Night Wolves and their leader are outspoken supporters of [[Joseph Stalin]], who ordered the murders.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt;

A Polish motocyclists' organization calling itself the ''Katyń Motocycle Raid'' (KMR) criticized the ban and said that Night Wolves already made two such trips in the past, and Polish public opinion was divided on the decision, with 38.7% supporting it and 28.5% opposing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://polska.newsweek.pl/czy-nocne-wilki-powinny-zostac-wpuszczone-do-polski-sondaz-newsweeka,artykuly,361750,1.html|title=Nocne Wilki nie wjadą do Polski. Jest decyzja|date=24 April 2015|website=Polska.newsweek.pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the ban, the KMR declared that it would light candles on the graves of fallen [[Red Army]] soldiers in the name of the Night Wolves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://niezalezna.pl/66418-niebywale-motocyklisci-z-rajdu-katynskiego-zapala-znicze-na-grobach-sowieckich-zolnierzy|title=Niebywałe!

Bikers who wanted to enter Germany at the Berlin Schönefeld International Airport were denied entry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xn--80ajgarobcee6b3h.xn--p1ai/finansyi-eng/russian-bikers-detained-in-the-airport-of-berlin/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518064950/http://xn--80ajgarobcee6b3h.xn--p1ai/finansyi-eng/russian-bikers-detained-in-the-airport-of-berlin/ |archivedate=2015-05-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 May, one member, who was trying to enter Germany by ship from Helsinki to [[Travemünde]], was deported to Finland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finlandtimes.fi/national/2015/05/06/16519/Night-Wolves-member-sent-back-to-Finland-from-Germany|title=Night Wolves member sent back to Finland from Germany - national|website=Finlandtimes.fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In December 2014, the United States announced sanctions against the Night Wolves&lt;ref name=TUS141219/&gt; due to their involvement in attacks on a gas distribution station in Strikolkove and the Ukrainian naval headquarters in Sevastopol, and recruitment of fighters for the war in Donbass.&lt;ref name=TUS141219/&gt;

===On Stalin===
According to [[Peter Pomerantsev]], the Night Wolves admire [[Joseph Stalin]],&lt;ref name=LRB131010/&gt; the Soviet dictator and one of the three main [[Allied leaders of World War II]]. On their ride to Berlin for a rally marking the anniversary of the end of World War II in 2015, they displayed red flags with portraits of Stalin and shouted [[World War II]]-era [[Red Army]] oath "For the Motherland! For Stalin!"&lt;ref name=AFP150425/&gt; According to Alexei Magister, the president of a biker club linked to the Night Wolves, " We are not harming anyone, we are just honouring the memory of those who fell to destroy Fascism".&lt;ref name=AFP150425/&gt;

On their ride to Berlin in 2015, the Night Wolves paid homage at the Russia's [[Katyn war cemetery|memorial]] to Polish prisoners of war killed in the [[Katyn massacre]] by the NKVD on Stalin's and [[Lavrentiy Beria|Beria]]'s orders in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2015/04/poland-denies-russia-night-wolves-bikers-entry-150427133730643.html Poland denies Russia 'Night Wolves' bikers entry]". Al Jazeera. 27 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===On Anti-Maidan protests===
In January 2015, the group's leader, the Ukraine-born Alexander Zaldostanov, expressed support for a Russian [[Anti-Maidan]] movement which said it was ready to use violence to stop anti-government protesters.&lt;ref name=GN150115/&gt;&lt;ref name=MK150121/&gt;

===On foreign countries===
[[File:Night wolves sofia 0141.jpg|thumb|Night Wolves in [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]] holding Bulgarian and Russian flags, 1 July 2016]]
In an interview, Zaldostanov said "For the first time we showed resistance to the global Satanism, the growing savagery of Western Europe, the rush to consumerism that denies all spirituality, the destruction of traditional values, all this homosexual talk, this American democracy."&lt;ref name=Teleg150317/&gt;
 
Andrei Bobrovsky, the leader of the Night Wolves ride from Moscow to Berlin, told ''Sputnik'' (the Russian government-controlled news agency) in May 2016, "The [[Slovaks]] received us very well. It seems that we [Russians] and them [Slovaks] are soul mates. We're not only Slavs, but we're also very similar in the way we think."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://sputniknews.com/art_living/20160506/1039214403/night-wolves-berlin-europe-support.html Despite Challenges Night Wolves Make it to EU, Thank Europeans for Support]". ''Sputnik.'' 6 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with Finnish journalist Juha Portaankorva in 2016, Zaldostanov said "I would love [[Finland]] to stay a good neighbor of Russia. I would love the Finns to trust Russia more than America."&lt;ref&gt;[http://yle.fi/uutiset/yon_sudet_ovat_valmiita_kuolemaan_venajan_puolesta_putin_on_vapauden_symboli/8892066 Yön sudet ovat valmiita kuolemaan Venäjän puolesta: "Putin on vapauden symboli"]. [[Yle]]. 20 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===On LGBT people===
In January 2015, Zaldostanov suggested that "Death to faggots" could be an alternate name for the Russian [[Anti-Maidan|anti-Maidan movement]].&lt;ref name=GN150115/&gt; At a February 2015 "Anti-Maidan" rally in Moscow organized by Zaldostanov, popular slogans included "We don't need Western ideology and gay parades!"&lt;ref name=Teleg150221/&gt;

== Membership ==
According to some of the Night Wolves, a prospective member must be male, from a former Soviet country, invited by an existing member, and must participate in club events for two years before becoming a member.&lt;ref name=AFP141007 /&gt;

The Night Wolves claim not to discriminate on religious grounds.&lt;ref name=AFP141007 /&gt; The Night Wolves are openly homophobic and do not allow gay men to join the club; women are also not allowed to join.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://rbth.asia/society/2013/11/12/russias_night_wolves_ride_alongside_putin_48963.html# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-04-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160114033552/http://rbth.asia/society/2013/11/12/russias_night_wolves_ride_alongside_putin_48963.html# |archive-date=2016-01-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Night Wolves have over 7000 members,&lt;ref name=TH140302 /&gt; including [[Ramzan Kadyrov]], the [[Head of the Chechen Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.mk/articles/8587/Chechen+Leader+Joins+Night+Wolves+Motorcycle+Club|title=Independent News for America - news and views from the US|website=Independent News for America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a Night Wolves Macedonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nightwolves.com.mk/index_eng.htm|title=NIGHT WOLVES MG -Moto Club Macedonia|website=Nightwolves.com.mk|accessdate=23 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
[[File:Demonstrace proti průjezdu motorkářského klubu Noční vlci.JPG|thumb|Protest against Night Wolves' ride through [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]], 7 May 2016]]
In the very beginning. the Night Wolves were often in conflict with other biking clubs. Yevgeny Vorobyev, the leader of the Three Roads, accused them of becoming too politicised. But since the club openly rejected the 1%'er status and has shown other motorcycle clubs they are nothing like the true 1% outlaw gangs that more often than not hold deep criminal ties, the Night Wolves have gained worldwide respect and support from other biker clubs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rbth.co.uk/society/2013/12/08/night_wolves_russias_answer_to_hells_angels_32369.html] {{dead link|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The representative of the [[Hells Angels]] in Russia told the ''Moscow Times'', "We call each other brothers and avoid being linked to any religious and political organizations, as these are things that divide people. To express my political views, I vote."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://themoscowtimes.com/news/more-to-russian-bikers-than-the-night-wolves-48542 More to Russian Bikers than the Night Wolves]". ''The Moscow Times.'' 27 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another view describes Ulson Gunnar in ''New Eastern Outlook'', an online magazine of the Institute of Oriental Studies of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]. For him, the affair of the Night Wolves shows the increasing hypocrisy of the West.&lt;ref&gt;Ulson Gunnar: ''Burying The Greatest Victory in Spite.'' in: ''New Eastern Outlook.'' 29. April 2015. [http://journal-neo.org/2015/04/29/burying-the-greatest-victory-in-spite/ Retrieved 25 August 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media ==
Mark Galeotti, writing in ''[[The Moscow Times]]'', described the Night Wolves as "a case study in the Kremlin's strategy of adopting and taming potentially hostile groups and using them precisely as tools of control—counter-counterculture, as it were."&lt;ref name=MT150519 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5787">{{About|the ethnic group|fraternity members called nupes|Kappa Alpha Psi|the British trade union|National Union of Public Employees}}

The '''Nupe''', traditionally called the '''Tapa''' by the neighbouring [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]], are an [[ethnic group]] located primarily in the [[Middle Belt]] and northern [[Nigeria]], and are the dominant group in [[Niger State]], an important minority in [[Kwara State]] and present in Kogi State as well.

==History==
The Nupe trace their origin to [[Tsoede]] who fled the court of [[Idah]] and established a loose confederation of towns along the [[Niger river|Niger]] in the 15th century. The proximity of Nupe to the Yoruba [[Igbomina]] people in the south and to the Yoruba [[Oyo Empire|Oyo]] people in the southwest led to cross-fertilization of cultural influences through trade and conflicts over the centuries. It is said that the famous Yoruba [[oba (ruler)|oba]] or king, Shango (also known as Jakuta) who was once an Alaafin of Oyo before being deified following his death, was the son of a Nupe (Tapa) woman.

Many Nupe were converted to [[Islam]] at the end of the eighteenth century by Mallam Dendo, a wandering preacher, and were incorporated into the [[Fulani Empire]] established by the [[Jihad]] led by [[Usman dan Fodio]] after 1806.

However, the traditions of Nupe were retained, hence the ruler of Nupe is the Etsu Nupe rather than being called [[Emir]]. The city of [[Bida]] fell to the colonialist British forces in 1897, the Etsu Abubakar was deposed and replaced by the more pliable Muhammadu (Vandeleur 1898). During the reign of Muhammadu, a Prince named Jimada moved to Patigi, northeast of Bida (not to be confused with near-identically spelt [[Pategi]], southwest of Bida,  on the southern and opposite bank of the Niger River) protesting against being ruled by a [[Fulani]] (Vandeleur 1898). Now Jimada’s descendants are fighting for the post of Etsu Nupe claiming to be the only existing pure Nupe ruling family.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}
The present Etsu Nupe is [[Yahaya Abubakar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2010-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More detail on the history of the Nupe kingdoms can be found in Burdon (1909), Nadel (1942), Hogben &amp; Kirk-Greene (1966:261-282) and Mason (1981).

==Population and demography==
There are probably about 3.5&amp;nbsp;million Nupes, principally in [[Niger State]], although a small but growing diaspora of Nupe can be found in Knowle in the West Midlands of England. The [[Nupe language]] is also spoken in Kwara and Kogi States. They are primarily [[Muslim]]s, with a few Christians and followers of [[African Traditional Religion]]. The Nupe people have several local, traditional rulers. The Etsu Nupe (Bida) is not Nupe and is actually part of the [[Fula people|Fula]] tribe but they came to rule the Bida in the 1806. They have no present capital, although they were originally based at Rabah and only moved to Bida in the nineteenth century.

==Traditions, art and culture==
The Nupe people have various traditions. Much of their culture was diluted by the [[Usman Dan Fodio]] [[jihad]] of the 19th century, but they still hold on to some of their culture which is very similar to that of ancient [[Egypt]]. Many Nupe people often have [[scarification|tribal scars]] on their faces (similar to an old Yoruba tradition), some to identify their prestige and the family of which they belong as well as for protection, as well as [[jewelry]] adornment. But these traditions are dying out in certain areas.
Their art is often abstract. They are well known for their [[wood]]en stools with patterns carved onto the surface.

The Nupe were described in detail by the ethnographer [[Siegfried Nadel]], whose book, ''Black Byzantium'', remains an anthropological classic.

'''Nüpode Huitoto''' or '''Nɨpode''' is an indigenous American language spoken in western South America. It has occasionally been referred to as Muinane Witoto, not to be confused with the [[Muinane language]].

==Classification==
Nüpode Huitoto belongs to the [[Witotoan languages|Witotoan]] language family.  Along with [[Mɨnɨca language|Mɨnɨca]] and [[Murai language|Murai]], it is one of the three Witoto Proper languages.

==Geographic distribution==
Nüpode Huitito is spoken by just 100 people in Peru's northeastern Loreto province, where it has official standing. Speakers also use the other two Huitoto languages (Murui and Minica). It is written using the Roman alphabet and has had some Bible portions translated into it. In addition, a dictionary and grammar have been written.

'''Orlando East Public Library''' is the oldest library in [[Soweto]] in South Africa. 

==History==
The library is said to have started in two iron huts in 1948 that lacked both electricity and seating.&lt;ref name=visitor&gt;{{cite web|title=Visitors check out libraries|url=http://www.joburg.org.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=8185&amp;catid=88&amp;Itemid=266|publisher=City of Johannesburg|accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:OE-Library-2.jpg|left|thumb|2013 plaques]]
The library was housed in the first building in Soweto designed to be a public library in 1950. It was built on Mooki Street by people from the local Vocational Training Centre and impressively it was larger than other public library then available in the main city of [[Johannesburg]]. It was probably the most important library for Africans in South Africa at the time.&lt;ref name=plaques/&gt; In 2012 the libraries in Soweto said they had nearly fifty thousand members.&lt;ref name=star&gt;{{cite news|last=Motumi|first=Mpiletso|title=For the love of learning, one book at a time|url=http://www.iol.co.za/the-star/for-the-love-of-learning-one-book-at-a-time-1.1241758?ot=inmsa.ArticlePrintPageLayout.ot|accessdate=10 August 2013|newspaper=The Star|date=24  February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Library's collection was given a substantial gift in 1963 when [[Madie Hall Xuma]], the American born widow of Dr. [[Alfred Bitini Xuma|A.B.Xuma]] who had been a President of the [[African National Congress]] during the 1940s, gave his book collection to the library. Her husband had died in 1962 and she moved back to the United States.&lt;ref name=gish&gt;{{cite book|last=Gish|first=Stephen|title=Alfred B. Xuma, 1893-1962: African, American, South African - Page 314|year=1994|page=314|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fO8gAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Madie Hall Xuma had also been active in South African politics becoming  president of the national council of the South African [[Young Women's Christian Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sahistory.org.za/people/madie-hall-xuma Madie Hall Xuma], sahistory.org.z, accessed July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Today==
In 2000 the library was updated and extended. In 2013 a blue plaque was installed to recognise the library's importance as the oldest public library.&lt;ref name=plaques&gt;{{cite web|title=Two more plaques|url=http://www.heritageportal.co.za/article/two-more-blue-plaques-soweto#_=_|publisher=Heritage Portal|accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The library has good signage and still has spacious accommodation. It attracts students to study with its "fairly full" shelves and a good reference section that includes textbooks. Upstairs there is a media centre and an area reserved for children's books.&lt;ref name=star/&gt; The library offered free internet access in 2013.&lt;ref name=visitor/&gt;

'''''Public Opinion''''' is a book by [[Walter Lippmann]], published in 1922. It is a critical assessment of functional democratic government, especially of the irrational and often self-serving social perceptions that influence individual behavior and prevent optimal [[Group cohesiveness|societal cohesion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Pseudo-environment==
The introduction describes man's inability to interpret the world: "The real environment is altogether too big, too complex, and too fleeting for direct acquaintance" between people and their environment. People construct a pseudo-environment that is a subjective, biased, and necessarily abridged [[mental image]] of the world, and to a degree, everyone's pseudo-environment is a fiction. People "live in the same world, but they think and feel in different ones."

Human behavior is stimulated by the person's pseudo-environment and then is acted upon in the real world. Some of the general implications of the interactions among one's psychology, environment, and the [[mass media|mass communications media]] are highlighted.

==News and truth==
By definition, pertinent facts are never provided completely and accurately; by necessity they are arranged to portray a certain, subjective interpretation of an event. Those who are most familiar with the greatest amount of facts regarding a certain environment, construct a pseudo-environment that aligns with their own 'stereotypes' and convey this to the public, knowingly or not, to suit their own private needs. This is inescapable human nature. [[Propaganda]] is inherently impossible without a barrier of [[censorship]] between the event and the public. As a consequence, the mass communication media, by their very nature as vehicles for informational transmission, are essentially vulnerable to manipulation.

The blame for that perceptual [[parallax]] falls not upon the mass media [[technology]] (print, radio, cinema, or, inferentially, television) or logistical concerns but upon certain members of society who attend to life with little [[intellectualism|intellectual]] engagement. That causes the following:

#The buying public: the "bewildered herd" (a term here borrowed from [[The Phantom Public]]) must pay for understanding the unseen environment by the mass communications media. The irony is that although the public's opinion is important, it must pay for its acceptance. People will be selective and will buy the most factual media at the lowest price: "For a dollar, you may not even get an armful of candy, but for a dollar or less people expect reality/representations of truth to fall into their laps." The media have the social function of transmitting [[public policy|public affairs]] information  and their business [[profit (economics)|profit]] role of surviving in the market.
#Nature of news: people publish already-confirmed news that are thus less disputable. Officially-available public matters will constitute "the news" and unofficial (private) matters are unavailable, are less available, or are used as "issues" for propaganda.
#News truth and conclusion: the function of news is to signal an event, and that signalling, eventually, is a consequence of [[editorial board|editorial]] selection and judgement;  [[journalism]] creates and sows the seeds (news) that establish [[public opinion]].

==Manufacture of consent==&lt;!-- [[Manufacturing Consent (disambiguation)]] links to this section --&gt;

When properly deployed in the [[public interest]], the manufacture of [[consent]] is useful and necessary for a cohesive society, because, in many cases, "the common interests" of the public are not obvious except upon careful analysis of the collected data, a critical intellectual exercise in which most people are uninterested or are incapable of doing. Therefore, most people must have the world summarized for them by the well-informed, and will then act accordingly.

{{Quotation|
That the '''manufacture of consent''' is capable of great refinements no one, I think, denies. The process by which public opinions arise is certainly no less intricate than it has appeared in these pages, and the opportunities for manipulation open to anyone who understands the process are plain enough. . . . [a]s a result of psychological research, coupled with the modern means of communication, the practice of democracy has turned a corner. A revolution is taking place, infinitely more significant than any shifting of economic power.... Under the impact of propaganda, not necessarily in the sinister meaning of the word alone, the old constants of our thinking have become variables. It is no longer possible, for example, to believe in the original dogma of democracy; that the knowledge needed for the management of human affairs comes up spontaneously from the human heart. Where we act on that theory we expose ourselves to self-deception, and to forms of persuasion that we cannot verify. It has been demonstrated that we cannot rely upon intuition, conscience, or the accidents of casual opinion if we are to deal with the world beyond our reach.|Walter Lippmann, ''Public Opinion'', Chapter XV}}

The political élite are members of the class of people who are incapable of accurately understanding, by themselves, the complex "unseen environment" wherein the public affairs of the modern state occur; thus, Lippmann proposes that a professional, "specialized class" collect and analyze data, and present their conclusions to the society's decision makers, who, in their turn, use the "art of persuasion" to inform the public about the decisions and circumstances affecting them.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter XV, “Leaders and the Rank and File”, section 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Public Opinion'' proposes that the increased power of [[propaganda]] and the specialized knowledge required for effective political decisions have rendered the traditional notion of [[democracy]] impossible. The phrase "manufacture of consent" was introduced, which the [[intellectual|public intellectuals]] [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Edward S. Herman]] used as the title of their book ''[[Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media]]'' (1988).

'''Sakawa''' is believed to be a Ghanaian term for illegal practices which combine modern Internet-based fraud with African traditionalist rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-32583161|title=Inside the world of Ghana's internet fraudsters|last=Darko|first=Sammy|date=10 May 2015|website=bbc.co.uk|publisher=BBC|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=4 March 2017|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rituals, which are mostly in the form of sacrifices, are intended to spiritually manipulate victims so that the scammer's fraud is successful.  The term Sakawa referred to specific online scams but has since broadened to include all types of [[419 scams|online frauds]] and scams mainly targeting foreigners. 

Historically, European countries have stolen and pilfered Africa's resources such as gold, bauxite, cobalt, industrial diamond, phosphate rock, platinum-group metals (PGM), vermiculite, and zirconium. Practitioners of Sakawa view the act as reparation, or stealing back resources and money from Europe. In impoverished areas, it can be seen as a way of survival for some.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o26Eks801oc |title=Internet Scamming in Ghana |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Abubakar |first=Zulaihatu |url=http://www.modernghana.com/news/419261/1/sakawa-guy-confesses.html |title=Sakawa Guy Confesses |publisher=Modern Ghana |date=2012-09-22 |accessdate=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/artikel.php?ID=260823 |title=Six teenagers engage in mysterious Sakawa deal &amp;#124; General News 2012-12-30 |publisher=GhanaWeb |date=2012-12-30 |accessdate=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Akwetey-Okunor |first=Isaac |url=http://thechronicle.com.gh/sakawa-coffin-exhibited-in-public/ |title=Sakawa coffin exhibited in public &amp;#124; Ghanaian Chronicle |publisher=The Ghanaian Chronicle |date=2012-06-22 |accessdate=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://graphic.com.gh/archive/features/the-sakawa-menace-any-solutions.html |title=The sakawa menace ...Any solutions &amp;#124; features |publisher=Daily Graphic |last=Dzandu |first=Sammy |date=2013-06-03 |accessdate=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3618">'''Social division of labor''', one of the two aspects of the [[Division of labour|division of labor]], is the social structural foundation of the specialized [[Production (economics)|commodity production]] divided between industries, firms, and [[job (role)|occupations]] of workers, or the ''technical'' division of tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Mandel, E. (1977). Introduction. In Marx, K. (1977). ''Capital: A Critique of Political Economy, Volume One.'' New York: Vintage Books, pg. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to centralized manufacturing, individuals specialized in the production of one product, trading their final product for final products made by other individuals. This can refer to specialized trades within a community, such as master sewers, blacksmiths, farmers, etc., or also the specializations of whole communities in contact with each other, such as one community making clothes, one making tools, and another producing food, which they exchange. Social division of labor greatly increases [[productivity]], because individuals can produce the product in which they have a [[comparative advantage]], and trade it to the individuals who cannot efficiently produce it for the products they need. The social division of labor creates [[exchange (organized market)|exchange market]] and [[prices]], by comparing the cost and time of making each product.

Social division of labor can be advantageous; however, too much [[specialization (functional)|specialization]] can be disadvantageous due to three main reasons. If a community specializes on a product too much, the community will become dependent on the success of their product and will endure an economic disaster if their product becomes replaced or goes extinct. For example, if bananas go extinct or grow under bad seasonal conditions in a country such as [[Ecuador]], the economy will suffer along with the whole community. Another case in which too much specialization could backfire is if all communities relied on one community to produce a certain product, because then the community would have a monopoly on that product and would have the ability to withhold production for their own greater benefit. A final problem is that individual workers who specialize in highly specific occupational skill-sets are vulnerable to [[economic reorganization]] associated with volatile 'product cycles' and developments of new industries where representation in [[Trade union|union]] constituencies may change (e.g., financial services) over older, outsourced or automated ones (e.g., weaving).&lt;ref&gt;Silver, B.J. (2003). ''Forces of Labor: Workers Movements and Globalization Since 1870.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marxists]] argue that [[capitalism]], and [[modes of production]] in general, change through [[Organic composition of capital|revolutions in the means of production]], which produce unemployed workers over-specializing in niche occupations, and hence, cannot enter the labour force to solve spiraling [[unemployment]] problems when these disappear.&lt;ref&gt;Yates, M. (2003). ''Naming the System: Inequality and Work in the Global Economy.'' New York: Monthly Review Press, pg. 92-3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Marx|Marx, K.]] (1977).

'''South Asian people in Ireland''' are residents or [[Citizenship|citizens]] of [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] who are of [[South Asian]] background or ancestry. There has been an important and well-established community of people of South Asian descent in Ireland for many decades. Non-Chinese Asian people (the category which mainly includes South Asian people) were reported to be the fastest growing ethnic group in Ireland in the 2011 census.&lt;ref name="The Journal" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/ethnicity-ireland-census-2011-640737-Oct2012/ |title=Non-Chinese Asians are the fastest growing ethnic group in Ireland – CSO |last = Hyland |first = Paul | date=19 Oct 2012 |accessdate=9 Feb 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these people self-identify as being fully Irish, while others prefer to identify with their original country of ancestry.

There is great variation in how much the South Asian people are integrated into Irish society. Many people of South Asian descent are well-integrated and embrace the [[culture of Ireland]]. Many children of South Asian descent are born in Ireland or have come to Ireland at a very young age, and therefore learn the [[Irish language]] in schools (which is compulsory to children who have been living in the country before the age of 7). There are South Asian people who are up to 2nd and 3rd generation Irish-born. However, many South Asian people still maintain their ancestral customs and languages, and therefore many religious festivals (such as [[Diwali]]) are well-known and accepted within Ireland.&lt;ref name="DCC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dublincity.ie/Press/PressReleases/PRNovember2012/Pages/DublinCelebratesDiwali2012.aspx |title=Dublin Celebrates Diwali 2012 |date=November 2012 |accessdate=2 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130702075918/http://www.dublincity.ie/Press/PressReleases/PRNovember2012/Pages/DublinCelebratesDiwali2012.aspx |archivedate=2 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Irish government does not collect detailed data on ethnicity in Ireland, population estimates vary, and non-Chinese Asian people are generally grouped in one category rather than groups based on people from individual South Asian countries.&lt;ref name="CSO" /&gt; Estimates say that people of South Asian ethnicity make up around 1 to 3% of Ireland's population. The Irish-India Council estimates that there are approximately 91,520 Indian-born people in Ireland.&lt;ref name="IIC" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irelandindiacouncil.ie/community.php |title=INDIAN COMMUNITY IN IRELAND |accessdate=2 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Some of the first South Asians to settle in Ireland came as doctors in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Ireland has long had a shortage of doctors and nurses, partially due to the emigration of native doctors,&lt;ref name="Irish Times1" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/health/2012/0703/1224319258200.html |title=Nearly half of medical students will leave Ireland |last=Duncan |first=Pamela |date=3 July 2012 |accessdate=10 Feb 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore hires many foreign medical staff.&lt;ref name="Irish Examiner" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/kfgbidmheyau/rss2/ |title=Over €80k spent on housing foreign doctors |last=Ó Cionnaith |first=Fiachra |date=22 Sep 2011 |accessdate=10 Feb 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the foreign medical staff come from India and Pakistan.&lt;ref name="Irish Examiner" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Irish Times" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2012/0216/1224311854143.html |title=Nearly €2m spent on recruiting doctors in India and Pakistan |last=Cullen |first=Paul |date=16 Feb 2012 |accessdate=9 Feb 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is probably due to the large numbers of medical graduates in those countries who are attracted to Ireland by its use of the English language, living standards, salaries, opportunities and new lives in Europe and the [[Western world]].

While South Asian doctors continue to come to Ireland, over the recent years (especially during the [[Celtic Tiger]], a period of major [[economic boom]] in Ireland), a significant number of other non-medical South Asians have come to live in Ireland, seeking labour, opportunities, better standards of living and money to support their families at home. These people may be skilled, semi-skilled or unskilled and have varying knowledge of the English language. Thousands of South Asians work in construction, business, industry, pharmaceuticals, e-commerce, management and education in Ireland. There are hundreds of Indian restaurants and Kebab shops that are entirely South Asian-owned and run in nearly all of Ireland's major urban centres.

In recent years, there has been a growing interest within students from South Asian countries or South Asian background to undertake third level education in Ireland. Some of these students decide to stay on and work in Ireland after they graduate. Many of Ireland's major third level institutions, most notably [[Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland]], [[Dublin City University]], [[Dublin Institute of Technology]], [[National University of Ireland, Galway]] and [[National College of Ireland]] have a substantial number of students of South Asian descent. The Irish government wants to double the number of overseas students in Irish universities by 2015, and has shortlisted India as one of the key areas for bringing in foreign students.&lt;ref name="Irish Times 00" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/education/universities-relying-on-fees-from-foreign-students-to-fill-funding-gap-28945567.html |title=Universities relying on fees from foreign students to fill funding gap |last=Donnelly |first=Katherine |date=10 Dec 2012 |accessdate=2 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the South Asian people that come to Ireland do not come directly from their South Asian countries and instead from other countries such as [[South Africa]], the [[United Kingdom]] or the [[United States]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

==Demographics==
These figures are based on the 2011 census figures. As the Irish government does not take detailed statistics based on race and ethnicity, these figures may not be exactly accurate and should therefore only be taken as an indicator.

==Culture==
South Asians are diverse in their cultures and speak different languages as well. Many South Asian people are well-integrated into Irish society and embrace the culture of Ireland. However, the presence of South Asian people in Ireland has noticeably affected many aspects of Irish life. Festivals such as [[Diwali]] and [[Eid al-Fitr]] are celebrated every year in Ireland by South Asian people and native Irish people alike. There are many different organisations in Ireland that promote South Asian events in Ireland.

Every year, there is a large [[Diwali]] celebration in [[Dublin]], with fireworks demonstrations, performances from well-known Indian musicians, traditional dancing from different parts of India, art, children's activities and a wide range of Indian cuisine and merchandising stalls selling traditional jewellery, clothing, [[Henna]], etc. The use of fireworks are generally restricted in Ireland, but the government makes an exception due to the importance of the festival to the [[Hindu]] people. There are also such gatherings during the festival of [[Holi]]. The Ireland India Council, a voluntary council made to serve the needs and business relations of the Indian people in Ireland, organises many events and gatherings on a regular basis.&lt;ref name="IIC" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irelandindiacouncil.ie/about.php |title=About the Ireland India Council |accessdate=10 Feb 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some South Asians have also been  influenced by parts of Irish culture. For example, every year in Ireland many South Asian people participate in the annual [[St Patrick's Day]] parades throughout the country. The [[Sligo]] parade is one example that has regular participation from the local Riverstown Cricket Club, mainly represented by people of Pakistani origin.&lt;ref name="RTCC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.riverstowncricketclub.com/article/rtcc-participation-in-st-patricks-day-2012.html |title=RTCC Participation in St. Patrick's Day 2012 |date=17 March 2012 |accessdate=10 Feb 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130113082607/http://www.riverstowncricketclub.com/article/rtcc-participation-in-st-patricks-day-2012.html |archivedate=13 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Dublin]], Indian people are known to have regular involvement. Also, there is a huge interest in Indian cuisine within Ireland. There are many Indian restaurants in Ireland, some are even being set up run by native Irish people.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

South Asians have also influenced sport in Ireland. There are numerous cricket clubs throughout the country that are run by South Asians or have large South Asian involvement and participation. One example is Riverstown Cricket Club in [[Sligo]]. This club also promotes cultural events such as parties for Eid-ul-Fittr.&lt;ref name="RTCC1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.riverstowncricketclub.com/ |title=RTCC Participation in St. Patrick's Day 2012 |accessdate=10 Feb 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130113082548/http://www.riverstowncricketclub.com/ |archivedate=13 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary and social issues==
There have been very few cases of problems experienced by the South Asian people in Ireland, and in general the South Asian people live happily alongside the native Irish population. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}} However, a few known cases are noted here.

After the [[September 11 attacks]], there was an increase of attacks against [[Sikh]]s, in response many Irish Sikhs decided to remove their turbans and cut their hair as they were being mistaken for being [[Muslim]].&lt;ref name="Independent" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/irish-sikhs-abandon-traditional-turbans-26251585.html |title=Irish Sikhs abandon traditional turbans |last=Grennan |first=Sinead |date=28 October 2001 |accessdate=11 Feb 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most prominent case is the [[death of Savita Halappanavar]], a woman of Indian origin from [[Galway]], who died aged 27 after being refused an abortion. She was reportedly refused abortion because of the fact that Ireland is "a Catholic country".&lt;ref name="inp" &gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/this-is-a-catholic-country-woman-dies-of-septicaemia-after-being-refused-an-abortion-in-irish-hospital-8315609.html |title='This is a Catholic country': Woman dies of septicaemia after being refused an abortion in Irish hospital |last=McKittrick |first=David |date=14 Nov 2012 |accessdate=11 Feb 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to protests outside the Irish embassies in New Delhi,&lt;ref name="irishcentral.ie"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishcentral.com/news/police-forced-to-guard-irish-embassy-in-new-delhi-over-angry-protests-179934651-237756701.html|title=Police forced to guard Irish embassy in New Delhi over angry protests|date=19 November 2012|work=[[irishcentral.ie]]|accessdate=12 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; London,&lt;ref name=bbc1&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-20321741|title=Woman dies after abortion request 'refused' at Galway hospital|work=BBC News|date=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berlin&lt;ref name="irishtimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2012/1121/breaking13.html|title=Up to 70 people also protested outside the Irish embassy in Berlin tonight|date=21 November 2012|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="midigrrrl"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.youreonlymassive.com/berlin-vigil/|title=Vigil for Savita and Protest at Ireland’s Abortion ban, Irish Embassy, Berlin|date=21 November 2012|work=Midi Grrrl|accessdate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Brussels,&lt;ref name="broadsheet.ie"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadsheet.ie/2012/11/22/last-night-in-brussels-2/|title=Last night in Brussels|date=22 November 2012|work=[[Broadsheet.ie]]|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as protests from local communities in Ireland. The [[Ministry of External Affairs (India)|Indian Minister for External Affairs]], [[Salman Khurshid]], summoned the Indian ambassador to Ireland, Debashish Chakravarti, to India for deliberations over the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/indian-woman-death-mea-summons-irish-ambassador-after-row-over-antiabortion-laws/305886-3.html|title=Savita death case: MEA summons Irish envoy after row over abortion, Updated|publisher=[[CNN-IBN]], IBN Live|work=IBN Live|date=16 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stereotypes of Jews''' are generalized representations of [[Jews]], often [[caricature]]d and of a prejudiced and [[antisemitic]] nature. The [[Jewish diaspora]]  have been [[stereotypes|stereotyped]] for over 2,000 years as scapegoats for a multitude of societal problems&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g2iRPNKdH4sC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=Jews+stereotypes#v=onepage&amp;q=Jews%20stereotypes&amp;f=false|title=Myth and madness: the psychodynamics of antisemitism|last=Ostow|first=Mortimer|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=1996|isbn=978-1-56000-224-6|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;  such as: Jews always acting with unforgiving hostility towards the Christians, Jews religious rituals thought to have specifically undermined the church and state, and Jews' habitual assassinations of Christians as their most extreme deeds.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Antisemitism continued throughout the centuries and reached a climax in the [[Third Reich]] during [[World War II]]. Modern day Jews are still stereotyped as greedy, nit-picky, stingy misers and are often depicted in caricatures, comics, and propaganda posters counting money or collecting diamonds. Early films such as ''Cohen's Advertising Scheme'' (1904, silent) stereotyped Jews as "scheming merchants".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anti-Semitic Stereotypes|last=Felsenstein|first=Frank|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|year=1995|isbn=|location=Baltimore, Maryland|pages=10–13|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/imagesjews.html|title=Media Resources Center|publisher=|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common objects, phrases and traditions used to emphasize or ridicule Jewishness include bagels,{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} playing violin, [[klezmer]], undergoing circumcision, ''[[wikt:kvetching|kvetching]]'', haggling and uttering [[List of English words of Yiddish origin|various Yiddish phrases]] like ''[[mazel tov]]'', ''[[shalom]]'', and ''[[oy vey]]''. Other Jewish stereotypes are the rabbi, the complaining and [[Jewish guilt|guilt]]-inflicting [[Jewish mother stereotype|Jewish mother]], often along with a meek and nerdy [[nice Jewish boy stereotype|nice Jewish boy]], and the spoiled and materialistic [[Jewish-American princess stereotype|Jewish-American princess]].

This widespread stereotype can be traced back to the 13th century, according to art historian Sara Lipton.

====Hair====

In European culture, prior to the 20th century, [[red hair]] was commonly identified as the distinguishing negative Jewish trait.&lt;ref name="Livak"&gt;''The Jewish Persona in the European Imagination: A Case of Russian Literature'', By Leonid Livak, (Stanford University Press 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvey2015"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harvey |first1=Jacky Coliss |title=Red: A History of the Redhead |date=2015 |publisher=Black Dog and Leventhal Publishers |location=New York City, New York |isbn=978-1-57912-996-5 |pages=61–66 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; This stereotype probably originated because red hair is a [[Dominance (genetics)|recessive trait]] that tends to find higher expression in highly [[Endogamy|endogamous]] populations, such as in Jewish communities where Jews were forbidden from marrying outsiders.&lt;ref name="Harvey2015"/&gt; Red hair was especially closely linked with [[Judas Iscariot]], who was commonly shown with red hair to identify him as Jewish.&lt;ref name="Harvey2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Melinnkoff"/&gt; During the [[Spanish Inquisition]], all those with red hair were identified as Jewish.&lt;ref name="Livak"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvey2015"/&gt; In Italy, red hair was associated with [[Italian Jews]].&lt;ref name="Melinnkoff"&gt;''Judas's Red Hair and The Jews'', ''Journal of Jewish Art (9)'', 31–46, 1982, Melinnkoff R.M&lt;/ref&gt; Writers from Shakespeare to Dickens would identify Jewish characters by giving them red hair.&lt;ref&gt;''Shakespeare and the Mediterranean: the selected proceedings of the International Shakespeare Association World Congress, Valencia, 2001'', ''Theatres and Performances'', (University of Delaware Press, 2004), page 40&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Medieval Europe]]an lore, "[[Red Jews]]" were a semi-fictional group of red-haired Jews, although this tale has obscure origins.

In part due to [[Genetic studies on Jews|their Middle Eastern ethnic origins]], Jews tend to be portrayed as swarthy and [[Hirsutism|hairy]], sometimes associated with a curly hair texture known as a "[[Jewfro]]". There is a brown, edible woodland fungus, ''[[Auricularia cornea]]'', commonly referred to as "Hairy Jew's ear".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jcu.edu.au/discover-nature-at-jcu/fungi/fungi-by-scientific-name/auricularia-cornea Discover Nature.

===Greed===
{{Main article|Economic antisemitism}}
[[File:Jewish speculators caricature, 1851.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A German cartoon of 1851 implies ingrained dishonesty in Jews. Enlarge for caption.]]
Jews have often been stereotyped as [[greed]]y and miserly. This originates in the [[Jews in the Middle Ages|Middle Ages]], when the Church forbade Christians to lend money while charging interest (a practice called [[usury]], although the word later took on the meaning of charging excessive interest). Jews were legally restricted to occupations as usurers, usually to Christians, and thus many went into money-lending. This led to, through the Middle Ages and the [[Renaissance]], the association of Jews with greedy practices.

[[File:Gilbert-Shylock.jpg|thumb|Gilbert's ''[[Shylock]] After the Trial'', an illustration to The ''Merchant of Venice'', Stereotypes of Jews.]]
Publications like ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' and literature such as [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' and [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[Oliver Twist]]'' reinforced the stereotype of the crooked Jew.  Dickens later expressed regret for his portrayal of [[Fagin]] in the novel, and toned down references to his Jewishness.&lt;ref name=Vallely&gt;{{cite web |last=Vallely |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Vallely |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/dickens-greatest-villain-the-faces-of-fagin-509906.html |title=Dickens' greatest villain: The faces of Fagin |date=7 October 2005 |work=The Independent |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205101924/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/dickens-greatest-villain-the-faces-of-fagin-509906.html |archivedate=5 December 2008 |accessdate=30 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, the character of Mr. Riah in his later novel ''[[Our Mutual Friend]]'' is a kindly Jewish creditor, and may have been created as an apology for Fagin.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Lesser references in ''[[Arabian Nights]]'', ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'', and even ''[[Hans Brinker]]'' are examples of the prevalence of this negative perception.
Some, such as [[Paul Volcker]], suggest that the stereotype has decreased in prevalence in the [[United States]]. A telephone poll of 1747 American adults conducted by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] in 2009 found that 18% believed that "Jews have too much power in the business world", 13% that "Jews are more willing than others to use shady practices to get what they want", and 12% that "Jews are not just as honest as other businesspeople".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Attitudes Toward Jews In America|url=http://archive.adl.org/anti_semitism/poll_as_2009/anti-semitism%20poll%202009.pdf|publisher=Anti-Defamation League|accessdate=28 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Belle juive====
[[File:Landelle.jpg|thumb|''The Jewess of [[Tangier]]'' (before 1808) by Charles Landelle, showing a stereotypical ''belle juive'']]
{{Main article|La belle juive}}
'''La belle juive''' (the beautiful Jewess) was a 19th-century literary stereotype. A figure that is often associated with having and causing sexual lust, [[temptation]] and sin. Her personality traits could be portrayed either positively or negatively. The typical appearance of the belle juive included long, thick, dark hair, large dark eyes, an olive skin tone, and a languid expression. An example of this stereotype is Rebecca in [[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott]]'s ''[[Ivanhoe]]''. Another example is Miriam in [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s romance ''[[The Marble Faun]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ub6EbnopW7cC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;lpg=PA95&amp;dq=La%20Belle%20Juive&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qHzBu3x8mJ&amp;sig=L78e1-3hVkiY_-isWueSVJde5aA&amp;hl=es-419&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwit5rnQmrTKAhVP6WMKHQVEBQIQ6AEIITAB#v=onepage&amp;q=La%20Belle%20Juive&amp;f=false|title=Antisemitism and Modernity: Innovation and Continuity|first=Hyam|last=Maccoby|date=14 February 2006|publisher=Routledge|accessdate=24 December 2016|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jewish mother====
{{See also|Narcissistic parent}}
The '''Jewish mother''' or '''Jewish wife stereotype''' is a common [[stereotype]] and [[stock character]] used by [[Jew]]ish and non-Jewish [[comedian]]s, television and film writers, actors, and authors in the United States.  The stereotype generally involves a [[nagging]], loud, highly-talkative, overprotective, smothering, and overbearing mother or wife, who persists in interfering in her children's lives long after they have become adults and who is excellent at making her children feel [[Guilt (emotion)|guilty]] for actions that may have caused her to suffer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZFdDPXB7eikC|title=Jewish Mothers Tell Their Stories: Acts of Love and Courage|author=Rachel Josefowitz|isbn=0-7890-1099-2|date=2000-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish mother stereotype can also involve a loving and overly proud mother who is highly defensive about her children in front of others.  Like Italian mother stereotypes, Jewish mother characters are often shown cooking for the family, urging loved ones to eat more, and taking great pride in their food.  Feeding a loved one is characterized as an extension of the desire to mother those around her. Lisa Aronson Fontes describes the stereotype as one of "endless caretaking and boundless self-sacrifice" by a mother who demonstrates her love by "constant overfeeding and unremitting solicitude about every aspect of her children's and husband's welfare[s]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sexual abuse in nine North American cultures|author=Lisa Aronson Fontes|pages=135|publisher=SAGE|year=1995|isbn=9780803954359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A possible origin of this stereotype is [[anthropologist]] [[Margaret Mead]]'s research into the European [[shtetl]], financed by the [[American Jewish Committee]].&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;''[http://www.slate.com/id/2167961/slideshow/2167764/entry/2167761/fs/0/ The Jewish Mother]'', Slate, 13 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Although her interviews at [[Columbia University]], with 128 European-born Jews, disclosed a wide variety of family structures and experiences, the publications resulting from this study and the many citations in the popular media resulted in the Jewish mother stereotype: a woman intensely loving but controlling to the point of smothering and attempting to engender enormous [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] in her children via the endless suffering she professes to have experienced on their behalf. The Jewish mother stereotype, then, has origins in the American Jewish community, with predecessors coming from Eastern European ghettos.{{ref|Frigg|1}} In Israel, with its diversity of [[Jewish diaspora|diasporic]] backgrounds and where most mothers are Jewish, the same stereotypical mother is known as the Polish mother (''ima polania'').&lt;ref&gt;Amy Klein, [http://www.jewishjournal.com/articles/item/different_cultures_produce_different_jewish_mothers_20070511 Different cultures produce different Jewish mothers] [[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles|Jewish Journal]] 10 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barry Glassner (2008) ''The Jewish Role in American Life: An Annual Review'' p.75 {{quotation|For example, the Jewish-mother cliche of American jokes doesn't make sense in Hebrew jokes - because the basic assumption is that most Israelis have a Jewish mother. So the overbearing parent figure, in Israeli humor, becomes a Polish mother.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comedian [[Jackie Mason]] describes stereotypical Jewish mothers as parents who have become so expert in the art of needling their children that they have honorary degrees in "Jewish Acupuncture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Taking stock|author=Benjamin Blech|pages=26|publisher=AMACOM Div American Mgmt Assn|year=2003|isbn=9780814407875}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rappoport observes that jokes about the stereotype have less basis in anti-Semitism than they have in gender stereotyping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Punchlines|author=Leon Rappoport|pages=113|publisher=Praeger Publishers|year=2005|isbn=9780275987640}}&lt;/ref&gt; Helmreich agrees, observing that the attributes of a Jewish mother—overprotection, pushiness, aggression, and guilt-inducement—could equally well be ascribed to mothers of other ethnicities, from Italians through Blacks to Puerto Ricans.&lt;ref name=Helmreich&gt;{{cite book|title=The things they say behind your back: stereotypes and the myths behind them|author=William B. Helmreich|edition=2nd|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=1984|isbn=9780878559534}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The association of this otherwise ''gender'' stereotype with Jewish mothers in particular, is, according to Helmreich, because of the importance that is traditionally placed by Judaism on the home and the family, and on the role of the mother within that family. Judaism, as exemplified by the Bible (e.g. the [[Eishet Chayil|Woman of Valor]]) and elsewhere, ennobles motherhood, and associates mothers with virtue. This ennoblement was further increased by poverty and hardship of Eastern European Jews immigrating into the United States (during the period 1881–1924, when one of the largest waves of such immigration occurred), where the requirements of hard work by the parents were passed on to children via guilt: "We work so hard so that ''you'' can be happy." Other aspects of the stereotype are rooted in those immigrant Jewish parents' drive for their children to succeed, resulting in a push for perfection and a continual dissatisfaction with anything less: "So you got a B? That could have been an A there." Hartman observes that the root of the stereotype is in the self-sacrifice of first-generation immigrants, unable to take full advantage of American education themselves, and the consequent transference of their aspirations, to success and social status, from themselves to their children. A Jewish mother obtains vicarious social status from the achievements of her children, where she is unable to achieve such status herself.&lt;ref name=Helmreich /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hartman&gt;{{cite book|title=Gender Equality and American Jews|author=Moshe Hartman|pages=26–27|year=1996|isbn=0-7914-3052-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest Jewish mother figures in American popular culture was Molly Goldberg, portrayed by [[Gertrude Berg]], in the situation comedy ''[[The Goldbergs (broadcast series)|The Goldbergs]]'' on radio from 1929 to 1949 and television from 1949 to 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jews and the American Soul|author=Andrew R. Heinze|pages=304–308|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2004|isbn=0-691-11755-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the stereotype as it came to be understood in the 20th century was exemplified by other literary figures. These include Rose Morgenstern from [[Herman Wouk]]'s 1955 novel ''[[Marjorie Morningstar (novel)|Marjorie Morningstar]]'', Mrs Patimkin from ''[[Goodbye, Columbus]]'' by [[Philip Roth]], and Sophie Ginsky Portnoy from ''[[Portnoy's Complaint]]'' also by Roth.&lt;ref name=Twark&gt;{{cite book|author=Jill E.

The Jewish mother became one of two stock female Jewish characters in literature in the 20th century, the other being the [[Jewish-American princess]]. The focus of the stereotype was different than its precursors, too. Jewish writers had previously employed a stereotype of an overbearing matron, but its focus had always been not the woman, but the ineffectual man whom she dominated, out of necessity. The focus of the Jewish mother stereotype that arose was based in a shift in economic circumstances of American Jews during the 20th century. American Jews were no longer struggling first generation immigrants, living in impoverished neighborhoods. The "soldier woman" work ethos of Jewish women, and the levels of anxiety and dramatization of their lives, was seen as unduly excessive for lifestyles that had (for middle-class Jews) become far more secure and suburban by the middle of the century. Jewish literature came to focus upon the differences between Jewish women and what Jews saw as being the various idealized views of American women, the "blonde bombshell", the "sex kitten", or the sweet docile "apple-pie" blonde who always supported her man. In contrast, Jewish writers viewed the still articulate and intelligent Jewish woman as being, by comparison, pushy, unrefined, and unattractive.&lt;ref name=Fishman /&gt;&lt;ref name=Brodkin /&gt;

Fishman describes the Jewish mother stereotype used by male Jewish writers as "a grotesque mirror image of the proverbial Woman of Valor". A Jewish mother was a woman who had her own ideas about life, who attempted to conquer her sons and her husband, and who used food, hygiene, and guilt as her weapons. Like Helmreich, Fishman observes that while it began as a universal ''gender'' stereotype, exemplified by [[Erik Erikson]]'s critique of "Momism" in 1950 and [[Philip Wylie]]'s blast, in his 1942 ''Generation of Vipers'', against "dear old Mom" tying all of male America to her apron strings, it quickly became highly associated with Jewish mothers in particular, in part because the idea became a staple of Jewish American fiction.&lt;ref name=Fishman /&gt;

This stereotype enjoyed a mixed reception in the mid-20th century. In her 1967 essay "In Defense of the Jewish Mother", [[Zena Smith Blau]] defended the stereotype, asserting that the ends, inculcating virtues that resulted in success, justified the means, control through love and guilt. Being tied to mamma kept Jewish boys away from "[g]entile friends, particularly those from poor, immigrant families with rural origins in which parents did not value education".&lt;ref name=Waxman /&gt;&lt;ref name=Brodkin&gt;{{cite book|title=How Jews Became White Folks and what that Says about Race in America|author=Karen Brodkin|pages=146, 164, 168–169|edition=4th|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=1999|isbn=9780813525907}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One example of the stereotype, as it had developed by the 1970s, was the character of [[List of other characters on The Mary Tyler Moore Show|Ida Morgenstern]], mother of [[Rhoda Morgenstern]], who first appeared in a recurring role on ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', and later as a regular on its spinoff ''[[Rhoda]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Something ain't kosher here|author=Vincent Brook|pages=57|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2003|isbn=9780813532110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Alisa Lebow]], in the late 20th century and 21st century the stereotype of the Jewish mother has "gone missing" from movies. She observes that there appears to have been no conscious effort on the part of screenwriters or film-makers to rewrite or change the stereotype, in pursuance of some revisionist agenda, but that it has simply fallen back a generation.&lt;ref name=Lebow&gt;{{cite book|title=First Person Jewish|author=Alisa Lebow|pages=41, 49–51|chapter=Reframing the Jewish Family|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=2008|isbn=9780816643554}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite this, the concept of the Jewish mother while declining in film can still be seen in popular culture.  One use of the Jewish mother stereotype-trope can be seen in the popular television program ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'', which premiered in 2007, and was played by the character of [[List of The Big Bang Theory characters#Mrs. Wolowitz|Howard Wolowitz's mother]] who is only heard as a voice character.  Mrs. Wolowitz is loud, overbearing, and over-protective of her son.  In the television show ''[[South Park]]'', [[Gerald and Sheila Broflovski|Sheila Broflovski]], mother of main character [[Kyle Broflovski]], is Jewish and represents a caricature of the stereotypes associated with her ethnicity and role, such as speaking loudly and with a Long Island accent and being overprotective of her son.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

====Nice Jewish boy====
The '''nice Jewish boy''' is a stereotype of [[Jew]]ish [[masculinity]] that circulates within the [[American Jews|American Jewish community]], as well as in mainstream American culture. In [[Israel]] and the parts of the [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora]] which have received heavy exposure to the [[American media]] that deploy the representation, the stereotype has gained popular recognition to a lesser extent.

The qualities ascribed to the nice Jewish boy are derived from the [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazic]] ideal of אײדלקײַט (''eydlkayt'', either "nobility" or "delicateness" in [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]).  According to [[Daniel Boyarin]]'s ''Unheroic Conduct'' (University of California Press, 1997), ''eydlkayt'' embraces the studiousness, gentleness and sensitivity said to distinguish the [[Talmud]]ic scholar and make him an attractive marriage partner.&lt;ref&gt;(23)&lt;/ref&gt;

The resistance that a Jewish male may launch against this image in his quest to become a "regular guy" has found its place in [[Jewish American literature]]. [[Norman Podhoretz]], the former editor of ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'', made the following comment about [[Norman Mailer]]'s literary and "extracurricular" activities:&lt;blockquote&gt;He spent his entire life trying to extirpate what he himself called the 'nice Jewish boy' from his soul, which is one of the reasons he has done so many outrageous things and gotten into trouble, including with the police. It's part of trying to overcome that lifelong terror of being a [[sissy]].&lt;ref&gt;Conversation with Norman Podhoretz, Institute of International Studies, UC Berkeley 1999 [http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/conversations/Podhoretz/podhoretz-con2.html].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;For [[Philip Roth]]'s semi-autobiographical avatar Alex Portnoy, neither the nice Jewish boy nor his more aggressively masculine counterparts (the churlish Jewboy, the "all-American" ice hockey player) prove to be acceptable identities to attain. The ceaseless floundering between the two fuels ''[[Portnoy's Complaint]].''

Although Jews had not been particularly associated with moneylending in antiquity, a stereotype of them acting in this capacity was developed beginning in the 11th century.  Jonathan Frankel notes that this stereotype, though obviously an exaggeration, had a solid basis in reality.  While not all Jews were moneylenders, the Catholic Church's prohibition of usury meant that Jews were the main representatives of the trade.&lt;ref name="Frankel1997"&gt;{{cite book|first=Jonathan|last=Frankel|title=The fate of the European Jews, 1939-1945: continuity or contingency?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rzp51R5WHtIC&amp;pg=PA16|accessdate=10 December 2011|date=1 December 1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-511931-2|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Schneider writes "Three large clusters of traits are part of the Jewish stereotype (Wuthnow, 1982). First, Jews are seen as being powerful and manipulative.

From 1914 to 1918, [[World War I]] shaped the identity and attitudes of American Jews for the better, yet is overshadowed by the devastation and tragedy of [[World War II]]. For the first time, American Jews were seen as major philanthropists, which is now a central part of American Judaism. The stereotype of being greedy and miserly seemed to be challenged. Aid was provided to Jews overseas by a new organization, the [[American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee]]. By the end of the war, the Joint raised more than $16.5 million, which is equivalent to about $260 million today.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berger|first=Paul|year=2014|title=How a World War Shaped Jewish Politics and Identity|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1548752254/|journal=Forward|volume=1|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, attitudes towards the Jews change after World War I; from 1920-1940, America saw the peak years of [[Antisemitism in the United States|American antisemitism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Jews of the United States|last=Diner|first=Hasia R.|publisher=University of California Press|year=2004|isbn=|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles, California|pages=208|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many left-wing Jews showed sympathy toward, or even supported, the [[Russian Revolution]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Jews were impressed by the Soviet’s commitment to giving Jews equal civil, political, and national rights, which fueled the Jewish plots conspiracy theories. This era in American history is called the [[Red Scare]]. Movements of restricting immigration, such as the [[Immigration Act of 1924]], often had individuals express suspicion and hatred on the Jews. In the intellectual context, social scientists were asking questions like, "Will the Jews ever Lose their Racial Identity?" and, "Are the Jews an Inferior Race?" In 1938, according to opinion polls, about 50 percent of Americans had low opinions of Jews.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Americans still believed the Jews to be untrustworthy and dishonest.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anti-Semitism in America|last=Dinnerstein|first=Leonard|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1994|isbn=|location=New York, New York|pages=147, 151|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many hoped that the racial stereotypes would disappear if the Jews worked to mold themselves. Massive amount of efforts was put towards Jewish charities, especially for new immigrants, in response to antisemitism in America.

More than one quarter, 27% of Americans believe Jews were responsible for the death of Jesus. The number of African-Americans with strong anti-Semitic beliefs remain high and stable since 1992, with today at 32%. On a more positive note, many Americans have positive views towards the Jews on ethics and family.

About 79% of Americans believe the Jews put an "emphasis on the importance of family life."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=2007|title=ADL Survey: Anti-Semitism in America Remains Constant, 15 Percent of Americans Hold 'Strong' Anti-Semitic Beliefs|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/470963391/|journal=US Fed News Service, Including US State News|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--  Ehrlich (1962) found that over 50% endorsed stereotypes of Jews as sticking together in business --&gt;

==In literature==
{{Main article|Stereotypes of Jews in literature}}

Jewish stereotypes in literature have evolved over the centuries.  According to [[Louis Harap]], nearly all European writers prior to the twentieth century projected the Jewish stereotype in their works.  Harap cites [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Gotthold Lessing]]'s ''[[Nathan the Wise]]'' (1779) as the first time that Jews were portrayed in the arts as "human beings, with human possibilities and characteristics."&lt;ref name=Harap6&gt;{{cite book |title=The image of the Jew in American literature: from early republic to mass immigration  |first=Louis |last=Harap|publisher=Syracuse University Press |year=2003 |page=6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iSHI3jnNOxIC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=Stereotypes+Jews+literature#v=onepage&amp;q=Stereotypes%20Jews%20literature&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-8156-2991-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harap writes that the persistence of the Jewish stereotype over the centuries suggests to some that "the treatment of the Jew in literature was completely static and was essentially unaffected by the changes in the Jewish situation in society as that society itself changed."  He contrasts the opposing views presented in the two most comprehensive studies of the Jew in English literature, one by [[Montagu Frank Modder]] and the other by [[Edgar Rosenberg]].  Modder asserts that writers invariably "reflect the attitude of contemporary society in their presentation of the Jewish character, and that the portrayal changes with the economic and social changes of each decade."  In opposition to Modder's "historical rationale", Rosenberg warns that such a perspective "is apt to slight the massive durability of a stereotype".&lt;ref name=Harap8&gt;{{cite book |title=The image of the Jew in American literature: from early republic to mass immigration  |first=Louis |last=Harap|publisher=Syracuse University Press |year=2003 |page=8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iSHI3jnNOxIC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=Stereotypes+Jews+literature#v=onepage&amp;q=Stereotypes%20Jews%20literature&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-8156-2991-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Harap suggests that the recurrence of the Jewish stereotype in literature is itself one indicator of the continued presence of anti-Semitism amongst the readers of that literature.&lt;ref name=Harap10&gt;{{cite book |title=The image of the Jew in American literature: from early republic to mass immigration  |first=Louis |last=Harap |publisher=Syracuse University Press |year=2003 |page=10 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iSHI3jnNOxIC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=Stereotypes+Jews+literature#v=onepage&amp;q=Stereotypes%20Jews%20literature&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-8156-2991-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===English literature===
[[File:A Jew Broker by Thomas Rowlandson, 1789.jpg|thumb|160px''|A Jew Broker'' by [[Thomas Rowlandson]], 1789]]
Although Jews were [[Edict of Expulsion|expelled]] from England in 1290, stereotypes were so ingrained and so durable that they persisted in English society as evidenced by presentations in English literature, drama, and the visual arts during the almost four-hundred-year period when there were virtually no Jews present in the British Isles.  Some of the most famous stereotypes come from English literature; these include characters such as [[Shylock]], [[Fagin]] and [[Svengali]].  Negative stereotypes of Jews were still employed by prominent twentieth-century non-Jewish writers such as [[Dorothy Richardson]], [[Virginia Woolf]], [[T.S. Eliot]], [[Evelyn Waugh]] and [[Graham Greene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The ridiculous Jew: the exploitation and transformation of a stereotype in Gogol, Turgenev, and Dostoevsky |first=Gary |last=Rosenshield|publisher=Stanford University Press |year=2008 |page=207 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HtCDjE2_WNMC&amp;pg=PT217&amp;dq=Jews+stereotypes#v=onepage&amp;q=Jews%20stereotypes&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-8047-5952-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===American literature===
Until the 20th century, the characterization of Jews in American literature was largely based upon the stereotypes employed in English literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The image of the Jew in American literature: from early republic to mass immigration  |first=Louis|last=Harap |publisher=Syracuse University Press |year=2003 |page=4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iSHI3jnNOxIC&amp;pg=PA=4&amp;dq=Stereotypes+Jews+literature#v=onepage&amp;q=Stereotypes%20Jews%20literature&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-8156-2991-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although Jewish stereotypes first appeared in works by non-Jewish writers, after World War II it was often Jewish American writers themselves who evoked such fixed images. The prevalence of anti-Semitic stereotypes in the works of such authors has sometimes been interpreted as an expression of self-hatred; however, Jewish American authors have also used these negative stereotypes in order to refute them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Multiethnic American Literature: I - M |first=Emmanuel Sampath |last=Nelson |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Company |year=2005 |page=1175 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M9Xk28_4NBoC&amp;pg=PA1175&amp;dq=Stereotypes+Jews+literature#v=onepage&amp;q=Stereotypes%20Jews%20literature&amp;f=false|isbn=978-0-313-33062-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jewface ===

==== Vaudeville act ====
"Jewface" was a [[vaudeville]] act that became popular among [[Eastern Europe]]an [[Jews]] who immigrated to the [[United States]] in the 1880s. The name plays off of the term "[[blackface]]," and the act featured performers enacting Jewish stereotypes, wearing large putty noses, long beards, and tattered clothing, and speaking in a [[Yiddish]] dialect. Early portrayals were done by non-Jews, but Jews soon began to produce their own "Jewface" acts. By the early 20th century, almost all the "Jewface" actors, managers, agents, and audience members were Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://forward.com/culture/325800/remembering-the-days-of-vaudeville-and-jewface/|title=Remembering the Days of Vaudeville and Jewface|last=Zax|first=Talya|date=8 December 2015|website=Forward|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Jewface" featured Jewish dialect music, written by [[Tin Pan Alley]] songwriters. These vaudeville acts were controversial at the time. In 1909 a prominent [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] [[rabbi]] said that comedy like this was "the cause of greater prejudice against the Jews as a class than all other causes combined," and that same year the [[Central Conference of American Rabbis]] denounced this type of comedy.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/29/fashion/29vaudeville.html|title=Love ‘Springtime for Hitler’?

==== Exhibit ====
"Jewface: Yiddish Dialect Songs of Tin Pan Alley" was an exhibit at the [[YIVO|YIVO Institute for Jewish Research]] from November 2015 to June 2016. The exhibit, curated by Eddy Portnoy, was focused on the sheet music of this comedy and used Jody Rosen’s sheet music collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yivo.org/jewface|title=Jewface: "Yiddish" Dialect Songs of Tin Pan Alley|last=|first=|date=|website=YIVO Institute for Jewish Research|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Jews in politics ==
{{further|Jewish views and involvement in US politics}}
Research on [[Elections in the United States|voting in the United States]] has shown that stereotypes play a crucial role in voter’s decision making on both a conscious and subconscious level.  Jewish political candidates are stereotyped as [[liberalism|liberal]].  Since becoming heavily involved in politics and the electoral process in the 1930s, Jewish leaders and voters have taken liberal stances on a number of issues.  From there the stereotype grew and is now assumed even though not always accurate.  An example of this took place in the 2000 presidential election where [[Joseph Lieberman]] was [[Al Gore]]'s Vice Presidential running mate.  He was labeled a liberal even though he described himself as "pro-business, pro-trade and pro-economic growth."  Although he had taken moderate and conservative positions on numerous issues, the stereotype defined him to many voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berinsky|first=Adam|last2=Mendelberg|first2=Tali|year=2005|title=The Indirect Effects of Discredited Stereotypes in Judgements of Jewish Leaders|url=|journal=American Journal of Political Science|publisher=Midwest Political Science Association|volume=49|pages=845–864|via=|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5907.2005.00159.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to local oral history, the indigenous people of the now-uninhabited island of [[Tetepare Island|Tetepare]] spoke their own language, different from the other languages of the region. Published materials are insufficient to establish whether this language was an [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian language]] like most of the surrounding languages ([[Roviana language|Roviana]], [[Marovo language|Marovo]] and the rest of the [[New Georgia languages|New Georgia subgroup]]), or a non-Austronesian language like neighboring [[Touo language|Touo]]. Language maps sometimes show the Touo language extending to [[Tetepare Island]], but this seems to be an accident.

These seven &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sindhisangat.com/sindhi_folk_tales.php|title=Sindhi Folk Tales in English {{!}} Sindhi Sangat {{!}} Sindhi book {{!}} Sindhi Community|website=www.sindhisangat.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;female characters, which the poet picked from history to convey his poetic message, have remained cultural icons in the history of Sindh for their bravery, passion, loyalty, commitment and character strength.

Marui's character portrays love for the land, its people, her commitment with her traditions, her stance before a tyrant king, Umar (عمر) or as some say (Amar—امر).&lt;ref&gt;[[Umar Marvi]]&lt;/ref&gt; Moomal's character portrays an image of a passionate soul, brimming with love for her beloved, Rano (راڻو) and suffers at the altar of separation and rejection but does not surrender.&lt;ref&gt;[[Momal Rano]]&lt;/ref&gt; Sasui is a daunting lady, who takes a debilitating journey of mountainous tracks to find her beloved, Punhoon (پنهون).&lt;ref&gt;[[Sassui Punhun]]&lt;/ref&gt; Noori is a fisher-woman who enchants the king Tamachi (تماچي) and turns out to be one of the most romantic characters in Sindhi literature&lt;ref&gt;[[Noori Jam Tamachi]]&lt;/ref&gt; like Moomal and Suhni. Sohni is a daring soul, who, in order to meet her beloved Mehar (ميهار) overlooks the hyper waves of the Indus River and keeps meeting her beloved on the far bank of the river and one night falls victim to the river waves and dies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sohni Mehar]]&lt;/ref&gt; Lilan loses her king (husband) Chanesar for an obscenely expensive necklace and undergoes travails of an unbearable separation to regain her status and character;&lt;ref&gt;[[Lilan Chanesar]]&lt;/ref&gt; while Sorath is a loving soul, full of passion and care about her beloved.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sorath Rai Diyach]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Shah Abdul Latif had structured his poetry book, ''Ganj'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Shah Jo Risalo]]&lt;/ref&gt; commonly known as ''[[Shah Jo Risalo]]'', in a form that suggested he intended to convey his message to the world through his verse. Among many of intentions behind his poetry, one of his major inclinations was towards highlighting the marginalized populace of the country, especially women. Accordingly, he chose these seven women or ({{lang-sd|'''ست سورميون '''}}) or '''Seven Queens''' (basically, Seven Heroic Women) of the [[Sindhi folktales]] as protagonists in his stories. These tragic romantic tales are ''[[Umar Marvi]]'', ''[[Momal Rano]]'', ''[[Sohni Mehar]]'', ''[[Lilan Chanesar]]'', ''[[Noori Jam Tamachi]]'', ''[[Sassui Punhun]]'' and ''[[Sorath Rai Diyach]]''.

These heroic women have a considerable influence on all the literature written in Pakistan ([[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], [[Urdu]], [[Balochi language|Balochi]], [[Pashto]], [[Saraiki dialect|Siraiki]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]) and particularly Sindhi literature in India, Moomal and Suhni being the prominent ones. From the texts of these folktales, and especially Latif's poetry, the role of these very women would appear to dominate the role of men as their counterparts. In Umar-Marvi, if only Latif's poetry is analysed, less space is dedicated to Umar's role, most of the story/narration refers to difficulties Marvi undergoes as a result of her abduction by the King Umar in the south-eastern part of [[Sindh]]. In Moomal-Rano, Moomal's role overwhelms everything else including Rano's character. Sasui-Punhoon is predominantly the story of Sasui's struggle to find her beloved husband who left her, apparently, for good. Only a little chunk is dedicated to Punhoon in this story. Noori-Jam Tamachi is predominantly the romantic tale from Noori's context. Tamachi is just like a source to help substantiate Noori's perspective. Suhni-Mehar is again the story of Suhni's anxiety and trouble she takes to meet Mehar. Mehar is not more than a figment of reference. In Lilan-Chanesar, again the supposed protagonist is Lilan. However, in Sorath-Rai Diyach, Sorath, unlike the characters in the aforementioned tales, dominates the story in the spirit not the material (space given to her in the text).

Thus, the story of each of these Seven Heroic Women (ست سورميون), little or more, one or the other way, relates to the cultural milieu and substance of the evolutionary process of the peoples living in the regions of old India and current Pakistan.

==Location==
This art heritage is practiced by the Toda tribals based in the Nilgiris (literally meaning 'neelam', the "Blue Hills") located in an elevation range of {{Convert|900| to| 2636| m}}.&lt;ref name =Tribe/&gt;

==History==
The Todas (also known by names such as Tudas, Tudavans, and Todar) who make this embroidery live as one small community, population of 1,600 spread over 69 [[Hamlet (place)|settlements]], and about 400 of them are stated to be engaged in the embroidery work&lt;ref name=Staff/&gt;) in the [[Nilgiri Hills]] in the higher elevations of the Niligiri plateau, in Tamil Nadu. Apart from their vocation as herdsmen of buffaloes and cultivation in the grass lands, they are also involved in the tradition of making many handicrafts items which includes traditional black and red embroidery practiced by the women of the community; the embroidery is usually made on their cloaks called "pootkhul(zh)y" which is draped by both their men and women.&lt;ref name =Tribe/&gt;&lt;ref name=Toda/&gt;

Murray Emeneau, a well known linguist of the [[Toda language]], had referred to nine Toda embroidery designs in his paper published in 1937. There are earlier mention in the ancient ethnographic documents of the Toda women working on this art form in the western region of the Nilgiri plateau.&lt;ref name= Muthukumaraswamy&gt;{{Cite news|last= Muthukumaraswamy|first= M. D |url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/history-and-culture/the-todas-and-their-embroidery-tradition/article7429489.ece|title=Every stitch has a story|date=16 July 2015|accessdate=31 January 2016|newspaper=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production process==
The local terms used to describe the embroidery work are 'kuty' or 'awtty' meaning "stitching" and 'kutyvoy' meaning the embroidered piece. The materials used in this work are roughly woven white cloth, woolen black and red threads with use occasionally of blue threads and manufactured needles. The designs developed relate to nature and the daily cycle of life.&lt;ref name =Tribe/&gt;
  
The fabric used is coarse bleached half white cotton cloth with bands; the woven bands on the fabric consist of two bands, one in red and one band in black, spaced at six inches. Embroidery is limited to the space within the bands and is done by using a single stitch darning needle. It is not done within an embroidery frame but is done by counting the warp and welf on the fabric which has uniform structure by the reverse stitch method. To bring out a rich texture in the embroidered fabric, during the process of needle stitching, a small amount of tuft is deliberately allowed to bulge. Geometric pattern is achieved by counting the warp and welf in the cloth used for embroidery.&lt;ref name= Muthukumaraswamy/&gt;&lt;ref name =Tribe/&gt;

Though their favorite study is related floral landscape, the patterns used in Toda embroidery do not cover many floral motifs but generally cover [[celestial bodies]] (like Sun and Moon), reptiles, animals, and horns of buffaloes, made in crimson and black colours. Rabbit ears are a constant depiction on the boundary of the embroidered cloth. Another common design in the form of black triangles in a box design is done in honour of their first priest. Women who do embroidery consider their work as a "tribute to Nature".&lt;ref name= Muthukumaraswamy/&gt; A dead body is always wrapped in an embroidered fabric with traditional designs and then buried. However, coloured stripes are used in fabrics of daily use. As a traditional garment, it is worn by both men and women at all ceremonial occasions and also at funerals. Elderly people of the community wear this cloth daily.&lt;ref name= Muthukumaraswamy/&gt;&lt;ref name =Tribe/&gt;

The inspecting agency to over see the quality of embroidery is the Textile Committee of the Ministry of Textiles of the [[Government of India]].&lt;ref name =Tribe/&gt;

'''Winslow Carlton''' (1907 – December 6, 1994) was an [[United States|American]] [[businessman]] and organizer of [[cooperatives]].

After graduating from [[Harvard University]] in 1929, Carlton began work with the [[Federal Relief Administration]], where he worked with self-help cooperatives in [[California]]. In this context he was assigned by the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt Administration]] to lead a successful project to determine whether it was feasible to develop an alternative [[mutualism (economic theory)|mutual]] [[self-help]] economy, in part based on barter, to the conventional economy in which many people were homeless and starving in spite of having skills and being ready to work. In 1935, Carlton married Margaret Gillies, the national director of the Self-Help Cooperative Service.&lt;ref&gt;Saxon, Wolfgang. [https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/08/obituaries/winslow-carlton-official-of-agencies-and-fund-chief-86.html Obituaries: Winslow Carlton, Official of Agencies And Fund Chief, 86.] ''[[New York Times]].'' 8 Dec. 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Upton Sinclair]] used Carlton as the model for his protagonist in his 1936 novel, ''Co-op: a Novel of Living Together''.  As in many historical novels, some of the motives attributed by the author to the protagonist were not those of the real person, a source of frustration for Carlton.

In 1938, Carlton founded Group Health Insurance, the first community based, non-profit insurance plan.  Later it expanded to include the first dental insurance plan and the first mental health insurance plan. He later founded Health Insurance Plan of [[New York City]], a non-profit insurance plan for city employees, the first [[Health maintenance organization|HMO]] in the [[Eastern United States]], and second in the United States as a whole.  In the political domain, Carlton worked on [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]]/[[Medicaid]] legislation with Senator [[Jacob Javitz]].

Carlton was a founding partner along with [[Alfred Winslow Jones|Alfred Jones]] in AW Jones, the first [[hedge fund]]. Modern hedge funds are based on different principles than this early fund, but they use the same term to describe themselves as organizations.  AW Jones at the time was based on economic principles of "[[Hedge (finance)|hedging]]" one's financial commitments with countervailing commitments in a way that led to optimized expected profit.

Carlton was on the board of Henry Street Settlement House internal [[Henry Street Settlement]] in [[New York City]] from 1931 on, was President, Chairman of the Board and director until 1978.  He was founder and chairman in New York of Mobilization for Youth, which became a national model for [[poverty reduction|anti-poverty program]]s for the inner city.

Carlton was also a founder in [[Washington, D.C.]] of the Foundation for Cooperative Housing which established cooperatives so that lower income working people could afford homes of their own.  With the help of Congress, FCH established a revolving fund that covered the capital costs of establishing housing.  People who were selected joined a cooperative that owned the housing, paying their costs of membership over time.  This proved to be a particularly successful model because co-op members were highly motivated to succeed in their lives once they had a homestead to protect and build upon, and because the approach cost the government nothing once the revolving fund had been established.

In the final decade of his life, Winslow Carlton co-founded and served as president of Selcore Labs, where a new a-cellular [[pertussis]] [[vaccine]] was developed and approved by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]].  With its name changed to NAVAC North American Vaccine Company, the company went public and was later acquired by [[Baxter International|Baxter]].

Carlton died of cancer at his home in [[Woods Hole, Massachusetts]] on December 6, 1994.

[[File:Laika_ac_School_(6900354645).jpg|thumb|A group of women in [[North Korea]]]]'''Women's rights in North Korea''' have varied throughout history. In recent history, major events of the 20th century, such as the [[Division of Korea]] and later the 1990s [[North Korean famine]] have played an important role in shaping sex relations.

==Historical context==
[[File:Women going out.jpg|thumb]]
[[File:Gesang School (i.e. kisaeng school).jpg|thumb]]
Before 1945, in [[North Korea]], women had very few rights. They were expected to give birth to male heirs and rear for them; to assure the continuation of the family line. Women had few opportunities to participate in the social, economic, or political life of society. In traditional Korean society, academic education was not considered important for women, and only a few received formal education. In the 19th century, it was Christian missionaries who established girls' schools, thus allowing young Korean females to obtain a modern education.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There were a few exceptions to these limitations. For example, female shamans were called on to cure illnesses by driving away evil spirits, to pray for rain during droughts, or to perform divination and fortune-telling.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The social status and roles of women were radically changed after 1945. On July 30, 1946, authorities [[38th parallel north|north of the thirty-eighth parallel]] passed a Sex Equality Law. The 1972 constitution asserted that "women hold equal social status and rights with men." The 1990 constitution stipulates that the state creates various conditions for the advancement of women in society. In principle, North Korean law supports sexual equality.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Many challenges remained however. Although the new regime brought women more equal participation in the labor force outside the home and more access to education, women continued to be considered inferior to men. An example is the strong son preference, and the burden put on women to do most housework, and the different sex roles confirmed by the practice of separating boys and girls at both the elementary and higher middle-school levels. Some aspects of school curricula for boys and girls also are different, with greater emphasis on physical education for boys and on home economics for girls. However, in the four-year university system, women majoring in medicine, biology, and foreign languages and literature seem especially numerous.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/north-korea/35.htm|title=North Korea - The Role of Women|website=countrystudies.us|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

North Korea remains a highly [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] society, and the women's role in the family sphere and in the public sphere has changed several times from the end of [[World War II]] to this day. After the war, women were enrolled in the socialist economy in large numbers, and played a major role in the rebuilding of the country. But as the economy improved in later decades, women were less needed in the workforce, and a move towards more traditional roles emerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/14/north-korean-sexism-women|title=Ask a North Korean: are women treated equally in your society?|first1=Je Son Lee for NK|last1=News|first2=part of the North Korea|last2=network|date=14 February 2015|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

State employees were given rations and most families could survive on that. But during the [[North Korean famine]] of the 1990s, these rations, known as the Public Distribution System, dried up and families had to look elsewhere for financial support. Men, even though they are not receiving payment, are still required to attend their government jobs. The cash-strapped government relies heavily on the free labor they get from men and it is unlikely to discontinue this practice anytime soon.&lt;ref name="hrw.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/04/13/north-korea-kim-il-sungs-birthday-no-celebration-women|title=North Korea: Kim Il-Sung's Birthday No Celebration for Women|date=13 April 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For men to be free from work, they actually must pay their employer between 20 and 30 times their monthly salary, allowing them to take on other, more profitable jobs, such as repair work. This payment is required even if one is unable to afford food to eat, otherwise they are punished with jail time. The current involvement of women in the labor market is uncertain, because of the unregulated [[grey economy]] [[informal sector| informal market]] economic system which has proliferated since the famine. According to [[Human Rights Watch]], women traders in the informal sector are vulnerable to sexual violence and exploitation, and "implementation of rules and regulations over market operations are arbitrary and government officials can demand bribes and sexually harass and coerce women with impunity."&lt;ref name="hrw.org"/&gt;

== Abuse against women ==
The evils of North Korea are well-chronicled from its political prison camps to the needless and preventable starvation deaths of between 450,000 and 2 million people. That latter estimate comes from an exhaustive report by a U.N. Commission of Inquiry, which found the North Korean government responsible for “crimes against humanity, arising from ‘policies established at the highest level of State,’"including “extermination, murder, enslavement, torture, imprisonment, rape, forced abortions and other sexual violence, persecution on political, religious, racial and gender grounds, the forcible transfer of populations, the enforced disappearance of persons and the inhumane act of knowingly causing prolonged starvation.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

What is less well-known is that North Korea’s women — particularly those on the low rungs of the ''[[songbun]]'' system, which categorizes North Koreans by their fealty to the regime — who suffer the most. Many are forced into prostitution by extreme poverty. Due to the unavailability of medical care and drugs, some have turned to opium in the false hope that it can prevent sexually transmitted diseases. Thousands more flee to [[China]] as refugees and fall prey to [[human trafficking|trafficker]]s.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Women also suffer the worst cruelties in North Korea’s [[Labor camp|prison camp]]s. A woman named Kim Hye-sook told the U.N. Commission that “the women who worked in the mines of Political Prison Camp No. 18 feared assignment to the night shift, because guards and prisoners preyed on them on their way to and from work and rape them.” Another witness “reported that the guards of Camp No. 18 were especially targeting teenage girls.” A former guard told of “how the camp authorities made female inmates available for sexual abuse to a very senior official who regularly visited the camp,” and that “after the official raped the women, the victims were killed.” A former guard at Camp 16 told Amnesty International that “several women inmates disappeared after they had been raped by officials,”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and concluded “that they had been executed secretly.” Indeed, the Commission found violence against women to be pervasive in North Korean society:
[[File:Flag of North Korea (WFB 2004).gif|thumb]]
''318. Witnesses have testified that violence against women is not limited to the home, and that it is common to see women being beaten and sexually assaulted in public. Officials are not only increasingly engaging in corruption in order to support their low or non-existent salaries, they are also exacting penalties and punishment in the form of sexual abuse and violence as there is no fear of punishment. As more women assume the responsibility for feeding their families due to the dire economic and food situation, more women are traversing through and lingering in public spaces, selling and transporting their goods. The male dominated state, agents who police the marketplace, inspectors on trains and soldiers are increasingly committing acts of sexual assault on women in public spaces. The Commission received testimony that while rape of minors is severely punished in the DPRK, the rape of adults is not really considered a crime.''&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/north-koreas-war-on-women/article/931581|title=North Korea's War on Women|date=2015-04-27|newspaper=Weekly Standard|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prostitution in North Korea ==
{{Main|Prostitution in North Korea}}
The great famine of the 1990s changed the North Korean society deeply that the world is still trying to understand the width and the depth of that change. During and after the famine, millions of North Koreans grasped at any survival strategy necessary to feed themselves. Those who did not change, and whom the state did not feed, died. For thousands of North Korean women, prostitution was the survival strategy of last way to feed themselves, and often, their children.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In Kim Il Sung’s North Korea, the sex trade was invisible to the outside world. That began to change when Chinese traffickers and johns forced thousands of female famine refugees into the sex trade. By the end of the great famine, prostitution had become stealthily ubiquitous inside North Korea. It also became more organized and more predatory, with state officials playing a growing role in its patronage and protection.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In Hamheung in 2008, a number of high-ranking party officials were accused of patronizing a tea house that also sold sex, and for protecting it against police interference. In Hyesan in 2009, the manager of a state-run inn frequently patronized by central party officials was arrested for pimping women and girls, some in their mid-teens. North Korea’s 2009 currency “reform” drove more women into the sex trade. By 2010, prostitution in Chongjin had been organized by “couple managers” who matched customers, often soldiers, with sex workers, often female university students, and sometimes women who had become dependent on drugs. In 2014, the manager of a North Korean factory in China was accused of pimping out female factory workers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The reports do not suggest that the state has consciously chosen to tolerate or profit from the sex trade as a matter of policy. The security forces periodically crack down on the sex trade, but inevitably, when corrupt authorities attempt to police a profitable trade, the authorities begin to see that trade as just another way to supplement their pay. More fundamentally, in a society where officials are the law, where enforcement is arbitrary, and where the state profits from trade at least indirectly, it can be hard to tell the difference between corruption and state policy. Today, the ''Daily NK'' reports that prostitution is increasingly run by well-connected businessmen and protected by the officials they’re connected with.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://freekorea.us/2015/08/03/in-north-korea-prostitution-used-to-be-a-survival-strategy-now-its-just-another-racket/|title=In North Korea, prostitution used to be a survival strategy. Now, it's just another racket|website=freekorea.us|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of state officials in organizing and profiting from the sex trade is repellant, but still not as repellant as the state’s role in creating the conditions that force women into prostitution to begin with. Women who ought to be doctors should not be sex workers. Of North Korea’s many tragedies, there may be none greater than all the human potential destroyed by its unjust and unequal political system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A North Korean defector informed Ha Tae-kyung, a lawmaker of the Saenuri Party and publisher specializing in North Korea, that were approximately 500 prostitutes in their city, which has a population of 400,000.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.koreaobserver.com/north-korea-sex-trade-and-drug-problem-26094/|title=Does North Korea have sex trade and drug problem?|date=2015-02-04|newspaper=The Korea Observer|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“If [we] depend on the simple arithmetic calculation and put North Korean population as 20 million, we can assume that there should be about 25,000 prostitutes in North Korea,” Ha told Sieff.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The state of the [[Human rights in Benin|rights]] of '''women in Benin''' has improved markedly since the restoration of democracy and the ratification of the [[Constitution of Benin|Constitution]], and the passage of the Personal and Family Code in 2004, both of which overrode various traditional customs that systematically treated women unequally.

The '''Zappo Zap''' were a group of [[Songye people]] from the eastern [[Kasai region]] in what today is the Democratic Republic of the Congo. They acted as allies of the [[Congo Free State]] authorities of the King of the Belgians, while trading in ivory, rubber and slaves.{{sfn|Vansina|2010|p=26}}
In 1899 they were sent out by the colonial administration to collect taxes. They massacred many villagers, causing an international outcry.{{sfn|Massacre in Congo State}}

==Traditional lifestyle==
According to the missionary [[William Henry Sheppard]], the Zappo Zap people all had tattoed faces and had filed their teeth to sharp points. They dressed only in two minute pieces of palm fiber cloth.
They were armed with long spears and with poisonous and steel arrows. Their iron weapons gave them an advantage in warfare, and when armed with guns the advantage was decisive.{{sfn|Phipps|2002|p=137}}
The Songa people, to whom the Zappo Zaps belonged, also used battle axes (kasuyu or [[Nzappa zap|zappozap]]).{{sfn|Phipps|2002|p=2020}}{{clarify|date=November 2012}}{{sfn|African Art - Life Force...}}

The Zappo Zaps worked as mercenaries for whoever was in power. They had been engaged in slave raiding long before the Europeans arrived, burning villages, partly eating bodies and selling hundreds of slaves to the Arabs each year in exchange for guns, ammunition and other manufactured goods.{{sfn|Phipps|2002|p=137}}
The Zappo Zaps did not restrict their cannibalism to ceremonial occasions, as in other cultures. Instead they hunted humans for food even when other game was plentiful. They considered human flesh a delicacy, and ate all parts of the body, even brains and eyeballs. They fried the meat in the same way as bacon.{{sfn|Phipps|2002|p=138-139}}

==European contacts==
[[File:Democratic Republic of the Congo - Kasai-Oriental.svg|thumb|The location of Kasai-Oriental, between the Lualaba and Angola.]]
In March 1883 [[Hermann Wissmann]], the first European traveller in the region, gave the name "Zappo Zap" to a leader known as Nsapu Nsapu who ruled over the town of Mpengie, part of the Ben'Eki kingdom.
This was a settlement with more than a thousand people, many of them slave warriors, to the east of the [[Sankuru River]] between [[Kabinda]] and [[Lusambo]].
The group were thriving through slave raiding and trading with caravans from the Arab and Swahili towns on the [[Lualaba River]] to the east and from [[Viye|Bihe]] in Angola to the southwest.{{sfn|Vansina|2010|p=25}}

In 1883 Zappo Zap felt strong enough to challenge the king of the Ben'Eki, leading to a civil war that drew in all the slavers of the region. In 1886, he was forced to retreat to a location near [[Lusambo]], where he built an impressive station. In 1887 he lost a battle on the right bank of the Sankuru and was forced to cross the river with his 3,000 followers. He met the Congo Free State commander [[Paul Le Marinel]] near Lusambo, with Chief [[Mukenge Kalamba]] of the [[Lulua people|Lulua]], both retreating westward from the Lualaba.{{sfn|Vansina|2010|p=25}}

When Herman Wissman met Zappo Zap in 1887 he was dressed with a turban, shirt and pants in the Arab fashion. The missionary Lapsley, who met Zappo Zap's son later, said he had a cloth tied about his head and was clothed from shoulder to knee. Lapsley gave Zappo Zap a gift of brass wire and cloth, and received some young slaves in return. Lapsley appreciated the gift, later releasing the slaves and educating them at the [[Luebo]] mission.{{sfn|Phipps|2002|p=138-139}}
Zappo Zap died in 1888 and was succeeded by his son, who also came to be known as Zappo Zap, and who moved with all his people to settle near the [[Luluabourg (city)|Luluabourg]] post in 1889.{{sfn|Vansina|2010|p=25}}
The second Zappo Zap died in 1894. His brother succeeded him and took the name Zappo Zap, which had become the title of the leader of the Zappo Zap people.{{sfn|Vansina|2010|p=26}}

In some ways, the Zappo Zaps seemed civilized to the missionaries.
They wore western-style clothing, lived in square houses and could speak both English and French.
On the other hand, with their plucked eyebrows and eyelashes, filed teeth and traditions of slaving and cannibalism they were stereotypes of the Western view of African savages.{{sfn|Campbell|2007|p=156}}
Lapsley said the Zappo Zaps were "magnificent men and handsome women, and carry themselves quite as an aristocracy". However, he was disturbed by the way in which small girls danced lasciviously in imitation of older women.{{sfn|Edgerton|2002|p=119}}

==Colonial allies==

The Zappo Zap settlement near Luluabourg prospered and the Zappo Zaps became the main allies of King Leopold's forces in Kasai. In 1890 they helped drive Kalamba away from Luluabourg, in 1891 they defeated two Angolan caravans that threatened the post from the south and in April 1895 they again repelled Kalamba from the post. In July 1895 they helped put down a rebellion by the Luluabourg garrison.
The Zappo Zaps provided mistresses to most of the Europeans, gaining further influence in the process.
They became the owners of large commercial plantations operated by slave labour and engaged in the slave trade to a small extent, which the authorities chose to ignore. But their main commercial activity was the ivory and rubber trade, bringing their goods to the trading centers at Lusambo, [[Luebo]] and [[Bena Makima]].{{sfn|Vansina|2010|p=26}}

==Kuba massacre==

In 1899 the commander of Luluabourg, Dufour, decided to demand rubber from the people of the [[Kuba Kingdom]] in payment of taxes. He asked Zappo Zap to provide the force needed. Zappo Zap delegated the job to his ally Mulumba Nkusu.{{sfn|Vansina|2010|p=27}}
About 500 warriors armed with guns went to the [[Pyang, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Pyang]] region of the Kuba Kingdom where they built a stockade. They summoned the local chiefs and demanded sixty slaves as well as herds of goats, baskets of food and 2,500 balls of rubber. When the chiefs refused to pay this huge tribute the stockade gate was closed and the chiefs were massacred. The Zappo Zaps then killed, looted and burned villages throughout the Pyang country.{{sfn|Vansina|2010|p=73}}
At least fourteen villages were destroyed, and many people fled to the bush in the middle of the rainy season.{{sfn|Massacre in Congo State}}

[[File:William h sheppard.jpg|thumb|450px|Dr. William Morrison (left) and Dr. William Sheppard (right) with Bakuba witnesses who traveled to Kinshasa for the 1909 trial against Sheppard and Morrison for libel brought by the Kasai Rubber Company.]]
The Reverend [[William Henry Sheppard]] was sent from the Southern Presbyterian mission at Luebo to investigate.{{sfn|Massacre in Congo State}}
Sheppard's journal of 14–15 September 1899 describes how he pretended to be friendly and through asking casual questions of Mulumba Nkusu, whom he knew, obtained the story of what had happened and was shown the remains.{{sfn|Benedetto|1996|pp=121ff}}

He saw evidence of cannibalism, counted eighty-one right hands that had been cut off and were being dried before being taken to show the State officers what the Zappo Zaps had achieved and found sixty women confined in a pen.{{sfn|Massacre in Congo State}}
The missionaries protested, and to their surprise the Free State officials responded, ordering the release of the women prisoners and the arrest of M'lumba. M'lumba was also puzzled at being arrested, saying he had only done what was asked of him.{{sfn|Edgerton|2002|p=135}}

In January 1900 a member of the Executive Committee for Foreign Missions acknowledged receiving reports and letters about the Zappo Zap atrocities from the missionaries, but reminded the mission of "the necessity of the utmost caution, in making representations regarding these matters to those in authority, or in publishing them to the world, to observe all proper deference to 'the powers that be,' and to avoid anything that might give any color to a charge of doing or saying things inconsistent with its purely spiritual and non-political character".{{sfn|Nakayama|Halualani|2011|p=286}}

However, in January 1900 the New York Times published a report giving Sheppard's findings. It detailed the atrocities in the [[Bena Kamba]] country and said that the Zappo Zaps were acting for the [[Congo Free State]].
It went on "They are sent out to collect rubber, ivory, slaves and goats as tribute from the people, and can then plunder, burn and kill for their own amusement and gain".{{sfn|Massacre in Congo State}}
The massacre caused an uproar against Dufour and the Congo Free State.{{sfn|Vansina|2010|p=27}}
When [[Mark Twain]] published his ''[[King Leopold's Soliloquy]]'' five years later, he mentioned Sheppard by name and referred to his account of the massacre.{{sfn|Thompson|2007|p=19}}
Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] mentioned the Zappo Zap in his 1909 book ''[[The Crime of the Congo]]'', but said they were forced to extract rubber for King Leopold's forces or they would in turn suffer punishment.{{sfn|Doyle|2008|p=155}}

Despite the help the Zappo Zaps had given, it was not until 1910 that Leopold's successors, the [[Belgian Congo]]lese colonial authorities, had brought the Kuba Kingdom under control and established a military post in the royal capital.{{sfn|Shoup|2011|p=156}}
The state stopped using the Zappo Zap as auxiliaries and they lost their special position, particularly after the Belgian State took over the colony in 1908.{{sfn|Vansina|2010|p=27}}
The Songye today are known for metallic decoration on wooden statuary. The Zappo Zap are considered to be the most skillful smiths of the Songye, the most skillful in the DRC and perhaps in Africa.{{sfn|Herbert|2003|p=226}}

{{Chinese name|[[Zhang (surname)|Zhang]]}}
'''Zhang Hongjie''' (1979–2004), also known as '''Steffi Zhang''' was a female 25-year-old [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] [[University of Canberra]] communications student found [[murdered]] in her flat in [[Belconnen]], Australia, in January 2005.

==Crime and disappearance==
The killing caused an uproar, because the body was not discovered for seven months after the murder, which was said to have happened in June 2004. [[Police]] identified a suspect in the killing, her boyfriend at the time: Zhang Long from the city of [[Dalian]]. He flew to [[Shanghai]], [[China]] shortly after the incident, where he was being held {{as of|2005|August|lc=y}}. No charge is being laid and China has not agreed to extradite him, although asked to by the Australian government.

After the killing, the University of Canberra introduced changes to their policy for international students and management.

The [[Government of Australia|Federal Government of Australia]] wants the [[Australian Capital Territory]] (ACT includes Canberra) to cooperate with the Chinese investigation into the murder, as written by a letter from [[John Howard]] to [[Chief Minister]] Stanhope in May 2005, and another request from Justice Minister [[Chris Ellison]] in June. The ACT government does not want to because it may mean Zhang would face a [[Execution by firing squad|firing squad]] in China if convicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canberra.yourguide.com.au/detail.asp?class%3Dnews%26subclass%3Dlocal%26story_id%3D404948%26category%3DGeneral+News%26m%3D6%26y%3D2005 |title=Murder probe stand-off - ACT to defy Feds, Chinese|author=Ben Doherty|author2=David McLennan|date=30 June 2005  |accessdate=7 September 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909042018/http://canberra.yourguide.com.au/detail.asp?class=news&amp;subclass=local&amp;story_id=404948&amp;category=General+News&amp;m=6&amp;y=2005 |archivedate=9 September 2006|website=canberra.yourguide.com.au|publisher=The Canberra Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
On 27 February 2005 a [[Warrant (law)|warrant]] was issued in the ACT Magistrates court for Zhang's arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.runsky.com/homepage/english/echo/userobject1ai590529.html |title=Parents of Chinese student seek justice|date=August 24, 2005|accessdate=7 September 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901002248/http://english.runsky.com/homepage/english/echo/userobject1ai590529.html |archivedate=1 September 2006|website=english.runsky.com|publisher=DalianNews.com  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The ACT Liberal opposition wants the Chief Minister to use his Chinese contacts to bring Zhang to 'justice'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canberraliberals.org.au/default.cfm?action%3Dnews_detail%26ID%3D4447 |title=STANHOPE SHOULD UTILISE HIS CHINESE CONTACTS RE MURDER CASE|date=7 April 2005|author=Bill Stefaniak MLA|authorlink=Bill Stefaniak |accessdate=7 September 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050620015222/http://www.canberraliberals.org.au/default.cfm?action=news_detail&amp;ID=4447 |archivedate=20 June 2005|website=www.canberraliberals.org.au }}&lt;/ref&gt;
