'''Abdi-Milkutti''' (=Abdi-milki) was a [[Sidon]]ian king (reigned ca. 680-677 BC) who rose up against [[Assyria]]n rule. He had formed an alliance with [[Sanduarri]], king of Kundi and Sizu, a prince of the [[Lebanon]], probably during the time of the civil war waged between [[Esarhaddon]] and two of his brothers who disputed his succession after they had murdered his father. The two kings had sworn to each other by the names of the great gods and revolted. 
As soon as this struggle was over, in response to the rebellion, Esarhaddon laid siege to Sidon, which after three years of siege, in 677 BC, was finally captured, destroyed and rebuilt as Kar-Ashur-aha-iddina, the Harbour of Esarhaddon. The Sidonian king was [[decapitation|decapitated]]. Sanduarri was also captured and decapitated and the heads of the two kings were hung around the necks of their nobles who were paraded through the streets of Nineveh.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=OGBGauNBK8kC&amp;lpg=PA125&amp;dq=abdi%20milkutti%20Sanduarri&amp;hl=hr&amp;pg=PA125#v=onepage&amp;q=abdi%20milkutti%20Sanduarri&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the treasure taken from Sidon went to the loyal king of the rival city [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]].

In his annals the Assyrian king states that he conquered Sidon and “tore up and cast into the sea its walls and its foundations.” This city was situated on a promontory jutting into the sea. The Sidonian king Abdi-Milkutti tried to escape by boat, but was “pulled out of the sea like a fish“ by the Assyrian king who cut off his head. Esarhaddon sent off to Assyria a rich treasure, including: “gold, silver, precious stones, elephant hides, ivory, maple and boxwood, garments of brightly colored wool and linen.”  He also took away the king’s wife, his children, and his courtiers: “His people from far and near, which were countless.”

{{cquote|On the month of [[Tašrîtu]] the head of the king of Sidon was cut off and conveyed to Assyria.}}

The defeated and executed king of Sidon was depicted on the Sam'al [[Victory stele of Esarhaddon]] from Zenjirli. The stele shows Abdi-Milkutti, dressed in his native costume and held with a coiled leash. Although he is shown standing with his hands raised, he reaches only to about Esarhaddon's knee. Next to him is shown a kneeling Egyptian prince.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, Barbara Nevling, "Language, Audience and Impact in Imperial Assyria" in ''Language and Culture in the Near East (Israel Oriental Studies)'', Shlomo Izre'El (Editor); Rina Drorp (Editor), Brill Academic Publishers, 1997, {{ISBN|978-90-04-10457-0}}, [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=majtzzdiaEEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=abdi-milkutti&amp;ots=dAVpGvxXEP&amp;sig=VcOhkOlLA8WdJAxTzJsEthYSpl4#PPA60,M1]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Anti-Monitor''' is a [[character (arts)|character]], a [[comic book]] [[supervillain]] and the [[antagonist]] of the 1985 [[DC Comics]] [[miniseries]] ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]].''

In 2009, Anti-Monitor was ranked as [[IGN]]'s 49th greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/49.html Anti-Monitor is number 49] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515014334/http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/49.html |date=May 15, 2009 }}, [[IGN]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==
The Anti-Monitor first appeared in ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' #2 (although he remained in shadow until ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' #5) and was created by [[Marv Wolfman]], [[George Pérez]], and [[Jerry Ordway]]. He was destroyed in ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' #12 only to return after a long absence in ''Green Lantern: [[Sinestro Corps]] Special'' #1 (Aug. 2007).

==Fictional character biography==
===Origins===
The Anti-Monitor is an enemy not only of the [[Green Lantern Corps]], but also of the entire Multiverse.

During the ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', it was revealed of the existence of all [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universes]] in the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]]; several villains were sent back in time to stop him, but were defeated by Krona and the other Oans.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} In a [[Ganthet|final revision]], it was established that it increased [[entropy]] in the universe, shortening its existence by a [[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]] years (see [[heat death of the universe|heat death]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' version 4&lt;/ref&gt; In any event, two beings were created, one on the moon of [[Oa]] and the other on the moon of Qward. On the moon of Oa, the being known as the [[Monitor (comics)|Monitor]] was instantly aware of his counterpart, the Anti-Monitor (although his official name is the Monitor in his own universe, and he is often addressed as such, the name Anti-Monitor is used to distinguish him from his heroic positive matter counterpart). By this time the Anti-Monitor had quickly conquered Qward, as well as the rest of the Antimatter universe.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} In searching for other places to conquer, he also became aware of his counterpart. These two beings battled for a million years, unleashing great powers against each other, but to no avail. At the end of their stalemate, they simultaneously attacked one another, rendering both inert for nine billion years.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

In ''Final Crisis'', it was revealed that, in the wake of the birth of the original Multiverse, an unfathomable being of limitless imagination, the original Monitor, or ''Overmonitor'', became aware of the life germinating in the budding Multiverse, occupying the void space in which he resided and which he encompassed. Curious about it and wanting to interact with and know better the lesser life-forms birthed by the Multiverse, he fashioned a probe, a ''smaller Monitor''. Unprepared to deal with the complexity of life and the passing of time, the probe-Monitor was instantly split into two symmetrical, opposite beings upon coming into contact with the Multiverse itself: the Monitor, embodying the positive matter and ''goodness'', and the Anti-Monitor, embodying anti-matter and ''evil''.&lt;ref&gt;''Final Crisis: Superman Beyond'' #2&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anti-Monitor, who appears monstrous, barely resembles the Monitor, who bears a physically near-human appearance. The Anti-Monitor has empty, sometimes luminous eye sockets, and a wide, wrinkled mouth, often mistaken for a mass of teeth. When his armor is destroyed by Supergirl, his form appears not dissimilar to that of the Monitor, but unstable, and surrounded by a coruscating aura of radiant energy—his life force, leaking out like water from a failing vessel, explaining the need for the armor. The Anti-Monitor himself refers to the armor as his "Life Shell".&lt;ref name="Crisis on Infinite Earths #7"&gt;''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' #7&lt;/ref&gt; When the Manhunters re-build his armor, it is revealed his body is little more than a churning mass of energy.&lt;ref&gt;''Tales of the Sinestro Corps: Superman-Prime'' #1 (Dec. 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Much later, when his helmet is disintegrated by Firestorm, the Anti-Monitor's head is revealed to be featureless except for his eyes and mouth.&lt;ref&gt;''Brightest Day'' #22 (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

In more modern times, the being known as [[Pariah (comics)|Pariah]] performed an experiment similar to the one Krona attempted long ago on a parallel Earth (this was changed later to an alternate world in the Post-''Crisis'' single universe).{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} This experiment resulted in the reawakening of both the Monitor and the Anti-Monitor and the destruction of Pariah's Earth and his universe.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The Anti-Monitor rebuilt his army, taking over Qward and using the Thunderers as his own private army, as well as creating the Shadow Demons from the elite of the Thunderers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

The Anti-Monitor then released a massive antimatter wave, absorbing the energies of the destroyed positive matter universes and growing stronger even as his counterpart grew weaker, and employed the second [[Psycho-Pirate]], using his emotion control powers to terrorize the populations of the planets he sought to conquer and destroy.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The Monitor, along with his aide [[Harbinger (DC Comics)|Harbinger]], gathered a group of heroes and villains from various alternate universes in order to combat the threat of the Anti-Monitor.&lt;ref&gt;''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; One of Harbinger's duplicates was taken control of by the Anti-Monitor and apparently killed the Monitor, but the Monitor was able to use his death to create a pocket universe to contain the remaining realities from the Anti-Monitor's attack.

After defeats by various heroes, including the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] ([[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]]) and [[Supergirl]] sacrificing themselves to destroy an antimatter cannon&lt;ref&gt;''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' #8&lt;/ref&gt; and to save [[Superman]]&lt;ref name="Crisis on Infinite Earths #7"/&gt; respectively, the Anti-Monitor absorbed the entirety of the antimatter universe and traveled to the beginning of time, intending to stop the formation of the positive matter Multiverse and to create a Multiverse where antimatter prevailed. When the heroes followed him there, he began to drain the power from most of them.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

However, the actions of the [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|Spectre]], empowered by the sorcerers of the surviving Earths, brought the Anti-Monitor to a stalemate. The villains of said Earths, sent to stop Krona from viewing the origins of the universe, failed due to squabbling, allowing Krona to see the hands of the Anti-Monitor and the Spectre struggling for domination, which collapsed the current Multiverse.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

From the ashes rose a new, singular universe. While various persons adjusted to the newly singular Earth (including those whose worlds and histories had been destroyed with the loss of the Multiverse), the Anti-Monitor, enraged, drew this new Earth into the antimatter universe, intending to destroy this last bastion of positive matter once and for all.&lt;ref&gt;''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' #11&lt;/ref&gt; What followed was the Shadow Demon War, wherein many heroes and villains lost their lives against the Anti-Monitor's forces. Finally, the combined efforts of various superheroes and villains (most notably [[Doctor Light (Kimiyo Hoshi)|Doctor Light]], the heroic Alexander Luthor, Jr. of [[Earth-Three]], [[Darkseid]], [[Superboy-Prime|Superboy]] of [[Earth Prime]], and [[Superman (Earth-Two)|Kal-L]], the [[Superman]] of [[Earth-Two]]) were able to weaken the Anti-Monitor enough for Kal-L to deliver the final blow, destroying the Anti-Monitor by punching him into a star. The star went nova and caused antimatter waves to erupt, threatening to destroy the entire antimatter universe. Kal-L and Superboy-Prime were willing to resign themselves to their final fates, when Alexander Luthor, using his power to open dimensions, revealed that he had created a "paradise dimension", and he used it to prevent the [[Lois Lane#Golden Age|Lois Lane Kent]] of Earth-Two from being erased from existence when the Post-''Crisis'' universe was formed, as he foresaw how events would unfold and refused to allow Superman to have to deal with such a terrible loss. Using his own body as a portal, Alexander Luthor, Kal-L, and Superboy-Prime went into the "paradise dimension" alongside Lois.&lt;ref&gt;''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' #12&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the other beings who died because of his actions were the entire [[Crime Syndicate of America]]; [[Kid Psycho]]; [[Nighthawk (DC Comics)|Nighthawk]]; the [[Losers (comics)|Losers]]; Flower of [[Easy Company (comics)|Easy Company]]; [[Starman (comics)#Prince Gavyn|Starman]]; the [[Immortal Man]]; the [[Hawk and Dove#Hank and Don Hall|Dove]]; [[Kole]]; [[Clayface#Matt Hagen|Clayface]] II; the [[Bug-Eyed Bandit]]; the [[Angle Man]]; [[Prince Ra-Man]]; [[Sunburst (comics)|Sunburst]]; [[Lori Lemaris]]; [[Aquagirl]]; [[Earth-Two|Earth-2]]'s [[Green Arrow]], [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)|Huntress]] and [[Alternative versions of Robin#Dick Grayson (Earth Two)|Robin]], and [[Alternative versions of Lex Luthor#Earth-Three|Alexander Luthor, Sr.]] of Earth-Three just to name a few.

[[Image:Crisistower.jpg|The Anti-Monitor's corpse turned into a tower. Panel from ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #3 (February 2006).&lt;br&gt;Art by [[Phil Jimenez]].|185px|thumb]]
The Superman (and Lois Lane) of Earth-Two, Superboy of Earth-Prime, and [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]] of Earth-Three, from their home in the hidden pocket universe, were revealed to be observing the events of the newly-formed universe as well as the actions of its heroes. Upon observing the events leading up to ''Infinite Crisis'', the heroes returned to the universe in an attempt to restore Earth-Two's existence, at the expense of Earth-One.&lt;ref&gt;''Infinite Crisis'' #2&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anti-Monitor's remains were then used by Alexander Luthor as part of a tuning fork, similar to the ones used during the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|first Crisis]]. This construct then created the vibrational frequency that Earth-Two was on prior to its non-existence, which in turn recreated Earth-Two with no visible expense to Earth-One, save the movement of characters who originated on Earth-Two to the recreated Earth-Two.&lt;ref&gt;''Infinite Crisis'' #4&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander Luthor then recreated the other Earths with his tuning fork, with their respective heroes forcibly migrating to said Earths.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Superboy-Prime (followed soon by Bart Allen) then returned from the [[Speed Force]] wearing what appeared to be select elements of the Anti-Monitor's armor, using it as a yellow sunlight collector.&lt;ref&gt;''Infinite Crisis'' #5&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the tower was destroyed when [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Kon-El]], the modern Superboy, and Superboy-Prime crashed into it while fighting each other, forcing all of the Earths to merge into a new Earth once again. Kon-El died in the arms of [[Wonder Girl (Cassie Sandsmark)|Wonder Girl]] as Superboy-Prime fled.&lt;ref&gt;''Infinite Crisis'' #6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Crisis Impact===
Despite his extremely limited exposure (he only appeared in the ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' miniseries, a single issue of ''[[Wonder Woman]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 1) #329 (February 1986)&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Flash'' (vol. 2) #149–150),{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} the Anti-Monitor was responsible for one of the most profound changes in the entire history of DC Comics, the DC Universe, and all of its parallel universes. The antimatter universe still existed, now with both Qward (said to be the counterpart of Oa) and an alternate Earth populated by counterparts of the positive matter heroes and villains (each taking the opposite role) among its planets.&lt;ref&gt;''JLA: Earth 2'' Graphic Novel (2000), by [[Grant Morrison]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most notable impact the Anti-Monitor had on the Post-''Crisis'' universe was the elimination of the Multiverse aspect of the DC Universe. Previously, there existed an infinite number of Earths, each one with a unique history, that could be accessed through various means, the most common being vibrational attunement. During Post-''Crisis'', with the restart of the universe as one thanks to the machinations of the Anti-Monitor, a simpler, more streamlined DC Universe seemed imminent, with characters acquired from [[Charlton Comics]], [[Fawcett Comics]], and [[Quality Comics]] all becoming incorporated into the new DC Universe.

===Post-''Infinite Crisis''===
[[File:Monitors.png|235px|thumb|left|The Anti-Monitor resemblance seen in the background in ''Brave New World'' #1.&lt;br&gt; Art by [[Ariel Olivetti]].]]
At the end of [[DC Comics]]' 2006 special ''[[One Year Later|Brave New World]]'' it is revealed that there are five figures calling themselves "the [[Monitors (comics)|Monitors]]" watching over the new post-''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' Earth. Four of the figures resemble the original Monitor from ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' and the fifth figure resembles the Anti-Monitor.&lt;ref&gt;''DCU: Brave New World'' #1 (Aug. 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; In the pages of ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis|Countdown]]'', it has been revealed that there are fifty-two Monitors, with each of them representing one of the new alternate realities in the new Multiverse, each with a slightly different appearance. A Monitor was shown in ''Supergirl'' recalling Dark Angel, one of his agents. This Monitor was dressed like the Anti-Monitor, but appeared to have no other connection.&lt;ref&gt;''Supergirl'' (vol. 5) #18 (Aug. 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sinestro Corps===
[[Image:GL14.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Prominent members of the Sinestro Corps with a Manhunter at far left, including (clockwise from top left): Hank Henshaw, Superboy-Prime, the Anti-Monitor, Parallax (inhabiting Kyle Rayner), and Sinestro. Art by [[Ethan Van Sciver]].]]

It was revealed that the Anti-Monitor was reborn following the recreation of the Multiverse and that he had been fueling [[Sinestro]]'s ideology since the return of [[Hal Jordan]], acting as the Sinestro Corps' "Guardian of Fear".&lt;ref&gt;"The Second Rebirth" ''Green Lantern: Sinestro Corps Special'' #1 (Aug. 2007) [[DC Comics]]&lt;/ref&gt; His body was rebuilt by the [[Manhunters (DC Comics)|Manhunters]], and in addition, he recruited [[Superboy-Prime]], the [[Hank Henshaw|Cyborg Superman]], and [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]], who was using Kyle Rayner as its host, along with Sinestro as his heralds.
&lt;ref&gt;"The Greatest Once, the Greatest Again" ''Green Lantern: Sinestro Corps Special'' #1 [[DC Comics]] (Aug 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the war between the Sinestro Corps and the [[Green Lantern Corps]], the Anti-Monitor contacted [[Hank Henshaw|Cyborg Superman]] to inquire about the status of [[Warworld|New Warworld]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The cosmic tyrant stated that he would soon abandon Qward and that he would kill Henshaw for his services, allowing him the peace that had for so long evaded the Cyborg.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' vol 1, #22 [[DC Comics]] (October 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Lost Lanterns made their way to the Antimatter universe to save Hal Jordan and the Ion power, they inadvertently stumbled upon the Anti-Monitor in a basement chamber of his stronghold on Qward.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} He was seemingly experimenting on or torturing the [[Ion (comics)|Ion]] entity previously inhabiting [[Kyle Rayner]]. He proceeded to kill [[Ke'Haan]] before the other Lanterns forced him back, taking the Ion entity from the planet and the Antimatter universe.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The Anti-Monitor pursued the Lanterns for a short while, long enough for Hal Jordan, [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]], [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]], and the other Lanterns to learn of his return.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Having this vital information, they then leave Qward.

Shortly after, the Sinestro Corps launched its attack on Earth. The Anti-Monitor traveled to the planet aboard New Warworld, and landed shortly thereafter, along with Sinestro.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He was attacked by [[Sodam Yat]] and other members of the Green Lantern Corps, but the tyrant killed the two unnamed beings and severely injured the [[Daxam]]ite Lantern.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Anti-Monitor began to siphon the positive matter of New York City to create his antimatter waves. However, he was attacked by the [[Guardians of the Universe]], angry at being impotent during his first war. The Anti-Monitor was able to counter the vicious attack, permanently disfiguring the face of [[Scar (comics)|Scar]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; John Stewart and Guy Gardner brought down New Warworld and the Yellow Central Power Battery, which were detonated next to the Anti-Monitor, and contained by a shield created by hundreds of Green Lanterns to contain the explosion; even this was not enough to kill him. Superboy-Prime, seeing an opportunity to defeat the now-weakened Anti-Monitor, flew through the Anti-Monitor's chest and hurled his shattered body into space.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Anti-Monitor's corpse crash landed on the planet Ryut in Sector 666,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; where a voice (later revealed to be another villain [[Nekron]]) acknowledged him and told him to rise. Before he could escape, the Anti-Monitor found himself imprisoned inside a large Black Power Battery.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #25 (January 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterwards, the Guardian Scar, corrupted by the Anti-Monitor's energies, dispatched the Green Lanterns [[List of Green Lanterns#Ash|Ash]] and [[List of Green Lanterns#Saarek|Saarek]] to locate and recover the Anti-Monitor's body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Green Lantern #27|last=|first=|publisher=DC Comics|year=2008|isbn=9780000001627|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blackest Night===
{{main|Blackest Night}}
Green Lanterns Ash and Saaraek find the Black Central Power Battery on Ryut and try to escape just before two monstrous hands emerge from below them and drag them into the planet, killing them.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

When the Black Central Power Battery is later brought to Earth, the Anti-Monitor stirs within, demanding to be let out. He begins draining the white energies of [[Hawk and Dove|Dove]] in order to escape.&lt;ref&gt;''Blackest of Night'' #7 (February 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; The Anti-Monitor is revived as a Black Lantern independent from Nekron's control. The Anti-Monitor is attacked by the various Lantern Corps just as he is about to pull itself out of the battery. Combining their energies, the various Lantern Corps use Dove as a human bullet shooting the Anti-Monitor through the head and pulling it back into the Battery.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #46 (March 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anti-Monitor is eventually resurrected by a White Power Ring and breaks free of the battery, fighting Nekron in revenge for imprisoning him. Nekron then banishes the Anti-Monitor back to the Antimatter universe.&lt;ref&gt;''Blackest Night'' #8 (March 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brightest Day===
{{main|Brightest Day}}
Later, the Anti-Monitor is confronted by the [[White Lantern Corps|White Lantern]] [[Deadman (DC Comics)|Boston Brand]].&lt;ref&gt;''Brightest Day'' #2 (July 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; As Brand is forced by the White Ring to "fight for his life", damaging the Anti-Monitor's chest plate armor, the Anti-Monitor retaliates by firing a burst of antimatter energy at Brand, who evades the blast. The Anti-Monitor resumes his duties in the Antimatter universe while Brand leaves.&lt;ref&gt;''Brightest Day'' #3 (August 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;
He also prevented Deathstorm, the Black Lantern version of Firestorm, in his attempt to destroy the White Lantern Battery and instead commands him to bring the lantern to him as well as an army, at which point Deathstorm brings back the Black Lantern versions of Professor Zoom, Maxwell Lord, Hawk, Jade, Captain Boomerang, Martian Manhunter, Aquaman, Hawkman, Hawkgirl, Deadman and Osiris.&lt;ref&gt;''Brightest Day'' #11 (October 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Deathstorm eventually brought the White Lantern Battery to him, and he tried to access the White Lantern power; however, his efforts are prevented by Firestorm who, after engaging in battle with the Anti-Monitor and the Black Lanterns, is able to regain the White Power Battery from the Anti-Monitor. It is also revealed that the "Entity" allowed itself to be captured so it could obtain unspecified information from the Anti-Monitor.&lt;ref&gt;''Brightest Day'' #22&lt;/ref&gt;

===The New 52===
The Anti-Monitor was introduced in [[The New 52]] (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe) in the final page of the ''[[Forever Evil]]'' storyline. It is revealed to the reader as the being which destroyed Ultraman's Krypton and Earth 3. As he is seen finishing off Earth 3, the Anti-Monitor declares "Darkseid shall be mine."&lt;ref&gt;''Forever Evil'' #7&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anti-Monitor has found the Prime Earth because the ring of Volthoom's energy signature was emitting a traceable pulse. He was also responsible for blinding Martian Manhunter's Earth 3 counterpart by burning out his eyes and destroying one of his arms beyond repair even by the capabilities that Martians possess.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League'' vol. 2 #33&lt;/ref&gt;

When Metron confronted the Anti-Monitor amidst the ruins of Earth 3, it was revealed the Anti-Monitor was the former owner of Metron's traveling device, the Mobius Chair—and that his true name ''is'' Mobius. He intends to make up for an unknown wrong he regrets, and to this end intends to kill Darkseid with the help of the latter's daughter,&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League'' vol. 2 #40&lt;/ref&gt; the half-Amazon known as [[Grail (comics)|Grail]].&lt;ref&gt;''Divergence'' #1 (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

With the help of Grail, the Anti-Monitor attacks the Justice League on Prime Earth while waiting for Darkseid as he was promised by Grail.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League'' vol. 2 #41&lt;/ref&gt; It is eventually revealed that Mobius became what he is after attempting to peer into the origins of the anti-matter universe on [[Qward]], similar to how [[Krona (comics)|Krona]] sought the origins of his positive-matter universe. While the White Light of the Life Equation was the origin of the positive universe, it is the Anti-Life Equation that serves as the foundation of the anti-matter universe, and Mobius released it from within the world of Qward, transforming him into the Anti-Monitor. With the Anti-Life Equation in his body, Anti-Monitor has the ability to enslave any living thing to his will. He uses this power to bind the [[Black Racer (DC Comics)|Black Racer]] to the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]], enslaving the New God and using him to kill Darkseid.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League'' vol. 2 #44&lt;/ref&gt;

Having killed Darkseid, the Anti-Monitor cocooned himself in a shell of energy, and eventually separated himself from the Anti-Life Equation, which was then obtained by Grail.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League'' vol. 2 #46&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterward, he emerged from his shell changed into a more human-looking form, once again Mobius, but still possessing vast power and legions of Shadow Demons.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League'' vol. 2 #47&lt;/ref&gt; Superwoman and Wonder Woman attempt to subdue him together with their respective lassos; one compelling him to be truthful, the other to obey, but he defies and defeats both. Ultraman, re-empowered through a chunk of kryptonite, engages Mobius, but is swiftly defeated and killed.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League'' vol. 2 #48&lt;/ref&gt; Next, Mobius is attacked by Lex Luthor, now wielding the Omega Force formerly belonging to Darkseid, as well as an army of Shadow Demons. Even now, fighting Luthor as well as the Justice League and the Crime Syndicate, Mobius has the upper hand until Grail, Darkseid's daughter, appears with Steve Trevor in tow. She has transferred the Anti-Life to him, making him into a new vessel for its power. Now basically a living weapon under Grail’s control, Trevor releases a tremendous blast of power against Mobius, reducing him to a smoldering skeleton.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League'' vol. 2 #49&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Anti-Monitor is one of the most formidable foes ever faced by the heroes of the DC Universe. He is directly responsible for more deaths than any other known DC supervillain, having destroyed thousands of universes.&lt;ref&gt;While the actual number of universes the Anti-Monitor destroyed was not literally infinite, the Monitor did state that "more than three thousand" universes had been lost.&lt;/ref&gt; He was powerful enough to kill a distracted [[Supergirl]]. He consumed thousands of positive-matter universes to increase his power and was able to personally battle scores of the multiverse's strongest heroes simultaneously. During the ''Blackest Night,'' the Anti-Monitor was resurrected as a Black Lantern. However, Nekron was unable to fully control him and thus was only able to subdue the Anti-Monitor to be used as a power source for the Black Lantern Corps' Central Battery.

The Anti-Monitor was also responsible for the death of [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]], the hero better known as the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]]. After capturing Barry because his ability to traverse the multiverse unaided made him a dangerous variable, the Anti-Monitor created an anti-matter cannon that would destroy the then-five remaining Earths with a concentrated beam much faster than the wave of entropy he had originally unleashed. The cannon was destroyed by the Flash when he escaped and forced the energies of the weapon's power source into itself, causing it to explode and Barry to disintegrate.

In addition to possessing vast size (varying from about nine feet to hundreds of meters tall), vastly superhuman strength, extraordinary durability (by the end of the ''Crisis'' series he was able to effortlessly withstand blows from [[Superman]] and even surviving a [[Stellar classification#Hot blue emission star classes|blue star]] going [[supernova]]), the ability to project destructive bolts of energy, and greatly augmenting another being's powers (as he did with [[Psycho-Pirate]], whose powers were increased to levels too much for him to handle), the Anti-Monitor also possessed reality-warping abilities, which he displayed by removing Psycho-Pirate's face. The Anti-Monitor also commanded an army of Qwardians and shadow demons and had access to highly advanced technology capable of shifting, merging, or destroying entire universes.

By far, his most devastating power was the ability to absorb the energies of his surroundings into himself; once he fused with his antimatter universe, he went even as far as absorbing the energies of entire universes. In addition to devouring the energies of untold numbers of universes, he also absorbed the energy of "over one million worlds" in his own anti-matter universe in order to gain the power to travel to the beginning of time to attempt to stop the creation of the positive matter universe. When Earth's heroes followed him to the beginning of time, he then absorbed all of their power and energy; this made him strong enough to alter the creation of the universe until he was opposed by the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]]. During his final battle in ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' #12, the Anti-Monitor maintained his power by "feeding on" a nearby star; and when his power was drained and he was reduced to a state of near-death, he absorbed his own anti-matter demons to rejuvenate himself.

The Anti-Monitor is not immortal, but may be ultimately indestructible so long as the anti-matter universe exists; having been destroyed with an immense effort at the end of the Crisis, he was recreated by his universe, just as he had been formed originally.

==Other versions==
* In the "Chain Lightning" arc of the Flash comics,&lt;ref&gt;''Flash'' (vol. 3) #145–150 (February–July 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; history is altered when Barry Allen is killed before the events of ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''. This forces [[Wally West]] into a timeline where the Anti-Monitor was never defeated and only the Antimatter Universe remains.
* A parody of the Anti-Monitor, called the "Aunty Monitor", appeared in [[Marvel Comics]]' ''What The--?!'' satire comic.&lt;ref&gt;''What The--?!'' #2 (September 1988)&lt;/ref&gt; Marvel's ''[[Mighty Mouse]]'' comic featured another parody, the "Anti-[[Minotaur]]".&lt;ref&gt;''Mighty Mouse'' #4–5 (Jan–Feb. 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Anti-Monitor makes a cameo appearance in ''[[DC animated universe (comics)#Justice League Adventures/Justice League Unlimited|Justice League Unlimited]]'' #32 (June 2007). He is described by [[Darkseid]] to be a "celestial being composed of negative energy" which Darkseid sought to gain to fuel the [[Anti-Life Equation]].
* The Monitor and Anti-Monitor both appear in ''[[Tiny Titans]]'' #12 (March 2009), with the Monitor telling [[Dick Grayson|Robin]] that he needs a hall pass, and the Anti-Monitor contradicting him because he is the "Anti" Monitor, until the two start having a "do not, do too" argument, and the Monitor says that everyone likes the Anti-Monitor better.

==In other media==
===Television===
The Anti-Monitor appears as the main antagonist of the second story arc of ''[[Green Lantern: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by [[Tom Kenny]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eldoblaje.com/datos/FichaPeliculaES.asp?id=25305 |title=Green Lantern: Linterna Verde: La Serie De Animación |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=eldoblaje.com |publisher= |access-date= |language=Spanish |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The animated version of the Anti-Monitor features a more machine-like face, with glowing blue eyes and a flat surface where the mouth is. This version of the Anti-Monitor was created by the renegade guardian [[Krona (comics)|Krona]] as the "ultimate being", one capable of anything, even time travel. When it was activated, the Anti-Monitor recognized its superiority and turned against Krona, forcing him to banish Anti-Monitor to another universe. He is first shown in the series in "The New Guy", entering the show's universe by splitting open the fabric of space and heading down to a nearby junkyard planet, destroying one of many automated security ships which tells him otherwise before declaring to several defunct Manhunters that he is their new master before unleashing a signal that reactivates all Manhunters across space for his own motives. The heroes engage him in the second episode of the arc, where he is shown as a giant, stating he consumed the planets of his universe and hungers for more. He shrugged off the most powerful attacks of both the Lanterns and their starship. The episode ends with him hitting Hal Jordan with an energy attack that ends up blasting him through a [[dimensional rift]]. The next episode reveals he was blasted into Anti-Monitor's prison universe, completely empty except for a single sun and an alternate version of Earth, the latter of which was spared in return for helping Anti-Monitor to escape his prison universe. After returning to his original universe, Hal joins with his Green Lantern comrades to fight Anti-Monitor and his Manhunter army. In the episode "Cold Fury", however, a super-charged and seemingly emotionless Aya sends the Anti-Monitor's head flying while she connects herself to his headless body for her own agenda. However, as revealed in "Ranx", this did not kill the Anti-Monitor, and as a head ended up at the planet Ranx where he intended to regain his power. Unfortunately, Aya and her modified Manhunters attack Ranx to obtain the device built in the Anti-Monitor's head to arrive to the moment before the Big Bang. Though the Anti-Monitor attempts to recruit Hal, Kilowog, and Razer for protection, Aya breaks through Ranx's defenses and subdues the lanterns. Though Anti-Monitor suggests her to let him accompany her to see the beginning of existence, Aya rips open the Anti-Monitor's head and obtains her prize.

===Web series===
*The episode "Anti-Hall Monitor" from ''[[DC Super Hero Girls]]'' is a parody of the Anti-Monitor.

===Video games===
* The Anti-Monitor appears as a boss in ''[[Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure]]''.
* The Anti-Monitor appears as a boss in ''[[DC Universe Online]]''.
* The Anti-Monitor appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego DC Super-Villains]]''. He also appears in a post-credits scene confronting [[Darkseid]] in Apokolips.

'''Apoptosis''' (from [[Ancient Greek]] ἀπόπτωσις "falling off") is a form of [[programmed cell death]] that occurs in [[multicellular organism]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Green|first=Douglas|title=Means to an End: Apoptosis and other Cell Death Mechanisms|year=2011|publisher=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press|location=Cold Spring Harbor, NY|isbn=978-0-87969-888-1|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Means_to_an_End.html?id=s8jBcQAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Biochemistry|Biochemical]] events lead to characteristic cell changes ([[Morphology (biology)|morphology]]) and death. These changes include [[Bleb (cell biology)|blebbing]], [[Plasmolysis|cell shrinkage]], [[Karyorrhexis|nuclear fragmentation]], [[Pyknosis|chromatin condensation]], [[Apoptotic DNA fragmentation|chromosomal DNA fragmentation]], and global{{vague|date = November 2017| reason= global in what sense: resulting from the intrinsic instability of all biology (anything whose stability is not dynamic is inert)? Or global to an idivdual in question, bcz their whole system is being challenged by their disease agent of the week?

The average adult human loses between 50 and 70 [[1,000,000,000|billion]] cells each day due to apoptosis.{{Citation needed|reason=Where is this figure from.

That is, about 5 out of every 1,000 cells (0.5%) die each day due to apoptosis.}} For an average human child between the ages of 8 to 14 year old approximately 20 to 30 billion cells die a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Karam|first=Jose A.|title=Apoptosis in Carcinogenesis and Chemotherapy|year=2009|publisher=Springer|location=Netherlands|isbn=978-1-4020-9597-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to [[necrosis]], which is a form of traumatic cell death that results from acute cellular injury, apoptosis is a highly regulated and controlled process that confers advantages during an organism's lifecycle. For example, the separation of fingers and toes in a developing human [[embryo]] occurs because cells between the digits undergo apoptosis. Unlike necrosis, apoptosis produces cell fragments called apoptotic bodies that [[phagocytic cells]] are able to engulf and remove before the contents of the cell can spill out onto surrounding cells and cause damage to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Alberts |first=Bruce |last2=Johnson |first2=Alexander |last3=Lewis |first3=Julian |last4=Raff |first4=Martin |last5=Roberts |first5=Keith |last6=Walter |first6=Peter | name-list-format = vanc |title=[[Molecular Biology of the Cell (textbook)]] |edition=5th |publisher=[[Garland Science]] |page=1115 |chapter=Chapter 18 Apoptosis: Programmed Cell Death Eliminates Unwanted Cells |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-8153-4105-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because apoptosis cannot stop once it has begun, it is a highly regulated process. Apoptosis can be initiated through one of two pathways. In the ''[[Intrinsic apoptosis|intrinsic pathway]]'' the cell kills itself because it senses [[Cellular stress response|cell stress]], while in the ''extrinsic pathway'' the cell kills itself because of signals from other cells. Weak external signals may also activate the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Raychaudhuri S | title = A minimal model of signaling network elucidates cell-to-cell stochastic variability in apoptosis | journal = PLOS One | volume = 5 | issue = 8 | pages = e11930 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20711445 | pmc = 2920308 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0011930 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both pathways induce cell death by activating [[caspase]]s, which are [[protease]]s, or enzymes that degrade proteins. The two pathways both activate initiator caspases, which then activate executioner caspases, which then kill the cell by degrading proteins indiscriminately.

Research on apoptosis has increased substantially since the early 1990s. In addition to its importance as a biological phenomenon, defective apoptotic processes have been implicated in a wide variety of diseases. Excessive apoptosis causes [[atrophy]], whereas an insufficient amount results in uncontrolled cell proliferation, such as [[cancer]].
Some factors like [[Fas receptor]]s and caspases promote apoptosis, while some members of the [[Bcl-2 family]] of proteins inhibit apoptosis.

German scientist [[Karl Vogt]] was first to describe the principle of apoptosis in 1842. In 1885, anatomist [[Walther Flemming]] delivered a more precise description of the process of programmed cell death. However, it was not until 1965 that the topic was resurrected. While studying tissues using electron microscopy, [[John Kerr (pathologist)|John Foxton Ross Kerr]] at the University of Queensland was able to distinguish apoptosis from traumatic cell death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kerr JF | title = A histochemical study of hypertrophy and ischaemic injury of rat liver with special reference to changes in lysosomes | journal = The Journal of Pathology and Bacteriology | volume = 90 | issue = 2 | pages = 419–35 | date = October 1965 | pmid = 5849603 | doi = 10.1002/path.1700900210 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the publication of a paper describing the phenomenon, Kerr was invited to join [[Alastair Currie|Alastair R. Currie]], as well as [[Andrew Wyllie]], who was Currie's graduate student,&lt;ref name="AHW 1972"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.a-star.edu.sg/astar/biomed/action/biomed_dvp_abstract.do?id=2901ddeb02dH |title=Prof Andrew H.

In 1972, the trio published a seminal article in the [[British Journal of Cancer]].&lt;ref name="Kerr1972"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kerr JF, Wyllie AH, Currie AR | title = Apoptosis: a basic biological phenomenon with wide-ranging implications in tissue kinetics | journal = British Journal of Cancer | volume = 26 | issue = 4 | pages = 239–57 | date = August 1972 | pmid = 4561027 | pmc = 2008650 | doi = 10.1038/bjc.1972.33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kerr had initially used the term programmed cell necrosis, but in the article, the process of natural cell death was called ''apoptosis''. Kerr, Wyllie and Currie credited James Cormack, a professor of Greek language at [[University of Aberdeen]], with suggesting the term apoptosis. Kerr received the [[Paul Ehrlich and Ludwig Darmstaedter Prize]] on March 14, 2000, for his description of apoptosis. He shared the prize with Boston biologist [[H. Robert Horvitz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Rourke MG, Ellem KA | title = John Kerr and apoptosis | journal = The Medical Journal of Australia | volume = 173 | issue = 11-12 | pages = 616–7 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11379508 | doi =  | url = http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/173_11_041200/orourke/orourke.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years, neither "apoptosis" nor  "programmed cell death" was a highly cited term. Two discoveries brought cell death from obscurity to a major field of research: identification of components of the cell death control and effector mechanisms, and linkage of abnormalities in cell death to human disease, in particular cancer.

The 2002 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize in Medicine]] was awarded to [[Sydney Brenner]], Horvitz and [[John Sulston|John E. Sulston]] for their work identifying genes that control apoptosis.  The genes were identified by studies in the nematode ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]]'' and homologues of these genes function in humans to regulate apoptosis.
[[File:John Sulston.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Sulston|John E. Sulston]] won the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 2002, for his pioneering research on apoptosis.]]

In Greek, apoptosis translates to the "falling off" of leaves from a tree.{{sfn|Alberts|p=1021}} Cormack, professor of Greek language, reintroduced the term for medical use as it had a medical meaning for the Greeks over two thousand years before. [[Hippocrates]] used the term to mean "the falling off of the bones". [[Galen]] extended its meaning to "the dropping of the scabs". Cormack was no doubt aware of this usage when he suggested the name. Debate continues over the correct pronunciation, with opinion divided between a pronunciation with the second ''p'' silent ({{IPAc-en|æ|p|ə|ˈ|t|oʊ|s|ᵻ|s}} {{respell|ap-ə|TOH|sis}}&lt;ref name="bartleby.com"&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/61/13/A0371350.html American Heritage Dictionary] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080630030923/http://www.bartleby.com/61/13/A0371350.html |date=June 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aboutapop"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nih.gov/sigs/aig/Aboutapo.html|title=About apoptosis|access-date=2006-12-15|year=1999|author=Apoptosis Interest Group|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061228100402/http://www.nih.gov/sigs/aig/Aboutapo.html|archive-date=28 December 2006|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and the second ''p'' pronounced ({{IPAc-en|ei|p|ə|p|ˈ|t|oʊ|s|ᵻ|s}}),&lt;ref name="bartleby.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="webster.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webster.com/dictionary/apoptosis|title=Definition of APOPTOSIS|author=|date=|website=www.webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; as in the original Greek.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} In English, the ''p'' of the Greek ''-pt-'' [[consonant cluster]] is typically silent at the beginning of a word (e.g. [[Pterodactylus|pterodactyl]], [[Ptolemy]]), but articulated when used in combining forms preceded by a vowel, as in [[helicopter]] or the orders of insects: [[Fly|diptera]], [[lepidoptera]], etc.

In the original Kerr, Wyllie &amp; Currie paper,&lt;ref name=Kerr1972/&gt; there is a footnote regarding the pronunciation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"We are most grateful to Professor James Cormack of the Department of Greek, University of Aberdeen, for suggesting this term. The word "apoptosis" ({{lang|grc|ἀπόπτωσις}}) is used in Greek to describe the "dropping off" or "falling off" of petals from flowers, or leaves from trees. To show the derivation clearly, we propose that the stress should be on the penultimate syllable, the second half of the word being pronounced like "ptosis" (with the "p" silent), which comes from the same root "to fall", and is already used to describe the drooping of the upper eyelid."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Activation mechanisms==
[[File:Apoptosis.png|right]]
[[File:Control Of The Apoptosis Mecanisms.pdf|thumb|alt=Control Of The Apoptotic Mechanisms|Control Of The Apoptotic Mechanisms]]

The initiation of apoptosis is tightly regulated by activation mechanisms, because once apoptosis has begun, it inevitably leads to the death of the cell.{{sfn|Alberts|p=1029}}&lt;ref name="pmid14499155"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Böhm I, Schild H | title = Apoptosis: the complex scenario for a silent cell death | journal = Molecular Imaging and Biology | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 2–14 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14499155 | doi = 10.1016/S1536-1632(03)00024-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two best-understood activation mechanisms are the intrinsic pathway (also called the [[mitochondrial]] pathway) and the extrinsic pathway.{{sfn|Alberts|p=1023}} The ''intrinsic pathway'' is activated by intracellular signals generated when cells are stressed and depends on the release of proteins from the intermembrane space of mitochondria.{{sfn|Alberts|p=1032}} The ''extrinsic pathway'' is activated by extracellular ligands binding to cell-surface death receptors, which leads to the formation of the [[death-inducing signaling complex]] (DISC).{{sfn|Alberts|p=1024}}

A cell initiates intracellular apoptotic signaling in response to a stress, which may bring about cell suicide.

Before the actual process of cell death is precipitated by enzymes, apoptotic signals must cause regulatory proteins to initiate the apoptosis pathway. This step allows those signals to cause cell death, or the process to be stopped, should the cell no longer need to die. Several proteins are involved, but two main methods of regulation have been identified: the targeting of [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]] functionality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bejarano I, Espino J, González-Flores D, Casado JG, Redondo PC, Rosado JA, Barriga C, Pariente JA, Rodríguez AB | title = Role of Calcium Signals on Hydrogen Peroxide-Induced Apoptosis in Human Myeloid HL-60 Cells | journal = International Journal of Biomedical Science | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 246–56 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 23675144 | pmc = 3614781 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or directly transducing the signal via [[Signal transducing adaptor protein|adaptor proteins]] to the apoptotic mechanisms. An extrinsic pathway for initiation identified in several toxin studies is an increase in calcium concentration within a cell caused by drug activity, which also can cause apoptosis via a calcium binding protease [[calpain]].

===Intrinsic pathway===
The [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]] are essential to multicellular life.  Without them, a cell ceases to [[Cellular respiration#Aerobic respiration|respire aerobically]] and quickly dies. This fact forms the basis for some apoptotic pathways.  Apoptotic proteins that target mitochondria affect them in different ways.  They may cause mitochondrial swelling through the formation of membrane pores, or they may increase the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane and cause apoptotic effectors to leak out.&lt;ref name="robspath"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D.

Mitochondrial proteins known as SMACs (second mitochondria-derived activator of [[caspase]]s) are released into the cell's [[cytosol]] following the increase in permeability of the mitochondria membranes.  SMAC binds to ''[[Inhibitor of apoptosis|proteins that inhibit apoptosis]]'' (IAPs) thereby deactivating them, and preventing the IAPs from arresting the process and therefore allowing apoptosis to proceed.  IAP also normally suppresses the activity of a group of [[cysteine protease]]s called [[caspase]]s,&lt;ref name="caspcontrol"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fesik SW, Shi Y | title = Structural biology. Controlling the caspases | journal = Science | volume = 294 | issue = 5546 | pages = 1477–8 | date = November 2001 | pmid = 11711663 | doi = 10.1126/science.1062236 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which carry out the degradation of the cell. Therefore, the actual degradation enzymes can be seen to be indirectly regulated by mitochondrial permeability.

[[Cytochrome c]] is also released from mitochondria due to formation of a channel, the [[mitochondrial apoptosis-induced channel]] (MAC), in the outer mitochondrial membrane,&lt;ref name="knife"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dejean LM, Martinez-Caballero S, Kinnally KW | title = Is MAC the knife that cuts cytochrome c from mitochondria during apoptosis? | journal = Cell Death and Differentiation | volume = 13 | issue = 8 | pages = 1387–95 | date = August 2006 | pmid = 16676005 | doi = 10.1038/sj.cdd.4401949 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and serves a regulatory function as it precedes morphological change associated with apoptosis.&lt;ref name="robspath"/&gt;  Once cytochrome c is released it binds with Apoptotic protease activating factor – 1 (''[[Apaf-1]]'') and [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], which then bind to ''pro-caspase-9'' to create a protein complex known as an [[apoptosome]].  The apoptosome cleaves the pro-caspase to its active form of [[caspase-9]], which in turn activates the effector ''caspase-3''.

[[Mitochondrial apoptosis-induced channel|MAC]] (not to be confused with the [[membrane attack complex]] formed by complement activation, also commonly denoted as MAC), also called "Mitochondrial Outer Membrane Permeabilization Pore" is regulated by various proteins, such as those encoded by the mammalian [[Bcl-2 family]] of anti-apoptopic genes, the homologs of the ''[[CED9 (gene)|ced-9]]'' gene found in ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]]''.&lt;ref name="knife2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dejean LM, Martinez-Caballero S, Manon S, Kinnally KW | title = Regulation of the mitochondrial apoptosis-induced channel, MAC, by BCL-2 family proteins | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1762 | issue = 2 | pages = 191–201 | date = February 2006 | pmid = 16055309 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbadis.2005.07.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lodish"&gt;{{cite book | title=Molecular Cell Biology| last=Lodish| first=Harvey| year=2004| publisher=W.H.

Bax and/or Bak form the pore, while Bcl-2, Bcl-xL or Mcl-1 inhibit its formation.

Two theories of the direct initiation of apoptotic mechanisms in mammals have been suggested: the ''TNF-induced'' ([[tumor necrosis factor]]) model and the  ''Fas-Fas [[ligand]]-mediated'' model, both involving receptors of the ''TNF receptor'' (TNFR) family&lt;ref name="fas"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wajant H | title = The Fas signaling pathway: more than a paradigm | journal = Science | volume = 296 | issue = 5573 | pages = 1635–6 | date = May 2002 | pmid = 12040174 | doi = 10.1126/science.1071553 }}&lt;/ref&gt; coupled to extrinsic signals.

'''TNF path'''

[[TNF-alpha]] is a [[cytokine]] produced mainly by activated [[macrophage]]s, and is the major extrinsic mediator of apoptosis. Most cells in the human body have two receptors for TNF-alpha: [[TNFR1]] and [[TNFR2]]. The binding of TNF-alpha to TNFR1 has been shown to initiate the pathway that leads to caspase activation via the intermediate membrane proteins TNF receptor-associated death domain ([[TRADD]]) and Fas-associated death domain protein ([[FADD]]). [[cIAP1]]/2 can inhibit TNF-α signaling by binding to [[TRAF2]]. [[CFLAR|FLIP]] inhibits the activation of caspase-8.&lt;ref name="tnfr1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen G, Goeddel DV | title = TNF-R1 signaling: a beautiful pathway | journal = Science | volume = 296 | issue = 5573 | pages = 1634–5 | date = May 2002 | pmid = 12040173 | doi = 10.1126/science.1071924 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Binding of this receptor can also indirectly lead to the activation of [[transcription factor]]s involved in cell survival and inflammatory responses.&lt;ref name="tfnpathway"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Goeddel, DV| title=Connection Map for Tumor Necrosis Factor Pathway| journal=[[Science Signaling|Science's STKE]]| url=http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/cm/CMP_7107| doi = 10.1126/stke.3822007tw132| volume=2007| pages=tw132}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, signalling through TNFR1 might also induce apoptosis in a caspase-independent manner.&lt;ref name="LAPFapoptosis"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen W, Li N, Chen T, Han Y, Li C, Wang Y, He W, Zhang L, Wan T, Cao X | title = The lysosome-associated apoptosis-inducing protein containing the pleckstrin homology (PH) and FYVE domains (LAPF), representative of a novel family of PH and FYVE domain-containing proteins, induces caspase-independent apoptosis via the lysosomal-mitochondrial pathway | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 280 | issue = 49 | pages = 40985–95 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16188880 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M502190200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The link between TNF-alpha and apoptosis shows why an abnormal production of TNF-alpha plays a fundamental role in several human diseases, especially in [[autoimmune disease]]s.

'''Fas path'''

The [[fas receptor]]  (First apoptosis signal) – (also known as ''Apo-1'' or ''CD95'') is a [[transmembrane protein]] of the TNF family which binds the [[FAS ligand|Fas ligand]] (FasL).&lt;ref name="fas"/&gt; The interaction between Fas and FasL results in the formation of the ''death-inducing signaling complex'' (DISC), which contains the FADD, caspase-8 and caspase-10. In some types of cells (type I), processed caspase-8 directly activates other members of the caspase family, and triggers the execution of apoptosis of the cell. In other types of cells (type II), the ''Fas''-DISC starts a feedback loop that spirals into increasing release of proapoptotic factors from mitochondria and the amplified activation of caspase-8.&lt;ref name="fassignal"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wajant H | title=Connection Map for Fas Signaling Pathway| journal=[[Science Signaling|Science's STKE]]| url=http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/cm/CMP_7966 | doi = 10.1126/stke.3802007tr1 | volume=2007 | pages=tr1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Common components'''

Following ''TNF-R1'' and ''Fas'' activation in mammalian cells a balance between proapoptotic ([[Bcl-2-associated X protein|BAX]],&lt;ref name="bax"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Murphy KM, Ranganathan V, Farnsworth ML, Kavallaris M, Lock RB | title = Bcl-2 inhibits Bax translocation from cytosol to mitochondria during drug-induced apoptosis of human tumor cells | journal = Cell Death and Differentiation | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 102–11 | date = January 2000 | pmid = 10713725 | doi = 10.1038/sj.cdd.4400597 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[BH3 interacting domain death agonist|BID]], [[Bcl-2 homologous antagonist killer|BAK]], or [[Bcl-2-associated death promoter|BAD]]) and anti-apoptotic (''[[Bcl-Xl]]'' and ''[[Bcl-2]]'') members of the ''Bcl-2'' family are established. This balance is the proportion of proapoptotic [[Protein dimer|homodimers]] that form in the outer-membrane of the mitochondrion. The proapoptotic homodimers are required to make the mitochondrial membrane permeable for the release of caspase activators such as cytochrome c and SMAC. Control of proapoptotic proteins under normal cell conditions of nonapoptotic cells is incompletely understood, but in general, Bax or Bak are activated by the activation of BH3-only proteins, part of the [[Bcl-2]] family.

'''Caspases'''
[[Caspase]]s  play the central role in the transduction of ER apoptotic signals. Caspases are proteins that are highly conserved, cysteine-dependent aspartate-specific proteases. There are two types of caspases: initiator caspases, caspase 2,8,9,10,11,12, and effector caspases, caspase 3,6,7. The activation of initiator caspases requires binding to specific oligomeric [[APAF1|activator protein]]. Effector caspases are then activated by these active initiator caspases through [[Proteolysis|proteolytic]] cleavage. The active effector caspases then proteolytically degrade a host of intracellular proteins to carry out the cell death program.

'''Caspase-independent apoptotic pathway'''
There also exists a caspase-independent apoptotic pathway that is mediated by AIF ([[apoptosis-inducing factor]]).&lt;ref name="pmid9989411"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Susin SA, Lorenzo HK, Zamzami N, Marzo I, Snow BE, Brothers GM, Mangion J, Jacotot E, Costantini P, Loeffler M, Larochette N, Goodlett DR, Aebersold R, Siderovski DP, Penninger JM, Kroemer G | title = Molecular characterization of mitochondrial apoptosis-inducing factor | journal = Nature | volume = 397 | issue = 6718 | pages = 441–6 | date = February 1999 | pmid = 9989411 | doi = 10.1038/17135 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apoptosis model in amphibians===

Amphibian frog ''[[Xenopus laevis]]'' serves as an ideal model system for the study of the mechanisms of apoptosis.

== Negative regulators of apoptosis ==
Negative regulation of apoptosis inhibits cell death signaling pathways, helping tumors to evade cell death and developing [[drug resistance]]. Many families of proteins act as negative regulators categorized into either antiapoptotic factors, such as [[Inhibitor of apoptosis protein|IAP]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and [[Bcl-2 family|Bcl-2]] proteins or prosurvival factors like [[CFLAR|cFLIP]], [[BNIP3]], [[FADD]], [[Protein kinase B|Akt]],  and [[NF-κB]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Razaghi A, Heimann K, Schaeffer PM, Gibson SB | title = Negative regulators of cell death pathways in cancer: perspective on biomarkers and targeted therapies | journal = Apoptosis | volume = 23 | issue = 2 | pages = 93–112 | date = February 2018 | pmid = 29322476 | doi = 10.1007/s10495-018-1440-4 | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10495-018-1440-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proteolytic caspase cascade: Killing the cell==
Many pathways and signals lead to apoptosis, but these converge on a single mechanism that actually causes the death of the cell. After a cell receives stimulus, it undergoes organized degradation of cellular organelles by activated proteolytic [[caspase]]s. In addition to the destruction of cellular organelles, [[mRNA]] is rapidly and globally degraded by a mechanism that is not yet fully characterized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thomas MP, Liu X, Whangbo J, McCrossan G, Sanborn KB, Basar E, Walch M, Lieberman J | title = Apoptosis Triggers Specific, Rapid, and Global mRNA Decay with 3' Uridylated Intermediates Degraded by DIS3L2 | journal = Cell Reports | volume = 11 | issue = 7 | pages = 1079–89 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25959823 | pmc = 4862650 | doi = 10.1016/j.celrep.2015.04.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt; mRNA decay is triggered very early in apoptosis.

A cell undergoing apoptosis shows a series of characteristic morphological changes. Early alterations include:
# Cell shrinkage and rounding occur because of the retraction [[lamellipodia]] and the breakdown of the proteinaceous cytoskeleton by caspases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Böhm I | year = 2003 | title = Disruption of the cytoskeleton after apoptosis induction by autoantibodies | url = | journal = Autoimmunity | volume = 36 | issue = | pages = 183–189 | doi=10.1080/0891693031000105617}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The cytoplasm appears dense, and the organelles appear tightly packed.
# Chromatin undergoes condensation into compact patches against the [[Nuclear membrane|nuclear envelope]] (also known as the perinuclear envelope) in a process known as [[pyknosis]], a hallmark of apoptosis.&lt;ref name="nuclearapopt"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Susin SA, Daugas E, Ravagnan L, Samejima K, Zamzami N, Loeffler M, Costantini P, Ferri KF, Irinopoulou T, Prévost MC, Brothers G, Mak TW, Penninger J, Earnshaw WC, Kroemer G | title = Two distinct pathways leading to nuclear apoptosis | journal = The Journal of Experimental Medicine | volume = 192 | issue = 4 | pages = 571–80 | date = August 2000 | pmid = 10952727 | pmc = 2193229 | doi = 10.1084/jem.192.4.571 | url = http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/abstract/192/4/571 | displayauthors = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chromatindegrad"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kihlmark M, Imreh G, Hallberg E | title = Sequential degradation of proteins from the nuclear envelope during apoptosis | journal = Journal of Cell Science | volume = 114 | issue = Pt 20 | pages = 3643–53 | date = October 2001 | pmid = 11707516 | url = http://jcs.biologists.org/cgi/content/full/114/20/3643 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The nuclear envelope becomes discontinuous and the DNA inside it is fragmented in a process referred to as [[karyorrhexis]].

Apoptosis progresses quickly and its products are quickly removed, making it difficult to detect or visualize on classical histology sections. During karyorrhexis, [[endonuclease]] activation leaves short DNA fragments, regularly spaced in size. These give a characteristic "laddered" appearance on [[agar]] gel after [[electrophoresis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gong J, Traganos F, Darzynkiewicz Z | title = A selective procedure for DNA extraction from apoptotic cells applicable for gel electrophoresis and flow cytometry | journal = Analytical Biochemistry | volume = 218 | issue = 2 | pages = 314–9 | date = May 1994 | pmid = 8074286 | doi = 10.1006/abio.1994.1184 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tests for [[DNA laddering]] differentiate apoptosis from [[Ischemia|ischemic]] or toxic cell death.&lt;ref name=Iwata&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Iwata M, Myerson D, Torok-Storb B, Zager RA | title = An evaluation of renal tubular DNA laddering in response to oxygen deprivation and oxidant injury | journal = Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN | volume = 5 | issue = 6 | pages = 1307–13 | date = December 1994 | pmid = 7893995 | doi = | url = http://jasn.asnjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/5/6/1307 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# [[Fragmentation (cell biology)|Fragmentation]]: The cell breaks apart into multiple [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicles]] called ''apoptotic bodies'', which undergo [[phagocytosis]]. The plasma membrane protrusions may help bring apoptotic bodies closer to phagocytes.

===Removal of dead cells===
The removal of dead cells by neighboring phagocytic cells has been termed [[efferocytosis]].&lt;ref name="pmid16778289"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vandivier RW, Henson PM, Douglas IS | title = Burying the dead: the impact of failed apoptotic cell removal (efferocytosis) on chronic inflammatory lung disease | journal = Chest | volume = 129 | issue = 6 | pages = 1673–82 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16778289 | doi = 10.1378/chest.129.6.1673 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Dying cells that undergo the final stages of apoptosis display phagocytotic molecules, such as [[phosphatidylserine]], on their cell surface.&lt;ref name="Phosphatidylserine"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Li MO, Sarkisian MR, Mehal WZ, Rakic P, Flavell RA | title = Phosphatidylserine receptor is required for clearance of apoptotic cells | journal = Science | volume = 302 | issue = 5650 | pages = 1560–3 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 14645847 | doi = 10.1126/science.1087621 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Phosphatidylserine is normally found on the inner leaflet surface of the plasma membrane, but is redistributed during apoptosis to the extracellular surface by a protein known as [[phospholipid scramblase|scramblase]].&lt;ref name="phago2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang X, Wu YC, Fadok VA, Lee MC, Gengyo-Ando K, Cheng LC, Ledwich D, Hsu PK, Chen JY, Chou BK, Henson P, Mitani S, Xue D | title = Cell corpse engulfment mediated by C. elegans phosphatidylserine receptor through CED-5 and CED-12 | journal = Science | volume = 302 | issue = 5650 | pages = 1563–6 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 14645848 | doi = 10.1126/science.1087641 | url = http://ntur.lib.ntu.edu.tw/handle/246246/161415 | displayauthors = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These molecules mark the cell for [[phagocytosis]] by cells possessing the appropriate receptors, such as macrophages.&lt;ref name="phago1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Savill J, Gregory C, Haslett C | title = Cell biology.

==Pathway knock-outs==
Many [[gene knockout|knock-out]]s have been made in the apoptosis pathways to test the function of each of the proteins.  Several caspases, in addition to [[APAF1]] and [[FADD]], have been mutated to determine the new phenotype.  In order to create a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) knockout, an exon containing the nucleotides 3704–5364 was removed from the gene.  This exon encodes a portion of the mature TNF domain, as well as the leader sequence, which is a highly conserved region necessary for proper intracellular processing.  TNF-/- mice develop normally and have no gross structural or morphological abnormalities.  However, upon immunization with SRBC (sheep red blood cells), these mice demonstrated a deficiency in the maturation of an antibody response; they were able to generate normal levels of IgM, but could not develop specific IgG levels.  Apaf-1 is the protein that turns on caspase 9 by cleavage to begin the caspase cascade that leads to apoptosis.  Since a -/- mutation in the APAF-1 gene is embryonic lethal, a gene trap strategy was used in order to generate an APAF-1 -/- mouse.  This assay is used to disrupt gene function by creating an intragenic gene fusion.  When an APAF-1 gene trap is introduced into cells, many morphological changes occur, such as spina bifida, the persistence of interdigital webs, and open brain.  In addition, after embryonic day 12.5, the brain of the embryos showed several structural changes.  APAF-1 cells are protected from apoptosis stimuli such as irradiation.  A BAX-1 knock-out mouse exhibits normal forebrain formation and a decreased programmed cell death in some neuronal populations and in the spinal cord, leading to an increase in motor neurons.

The caspase proteins are integral parts of the apoptosis pathway, so it follows that knock-outs made have varying damaging results.  A caspase 9 knock-out leads to a severe brain malformation.  A caspase 8 knock-out leads to cardiac failure and thus embryonic lethality.  However, with the use of cre-lox technology, a caspase 8 knock-out has been created that exhibits an increase in peripheral T cells, an impaired T cell response, and a defect in neural tube closure.  These mice were found to be resistant to apoptosis mediated by CD95, TNFR, etc. but not resistant to apoptosis caused by UV irradiation, chemotherapeutic drugs, and other stimuli.  Finally, a caspase 3 knock-out was characterized by ectopic cell masses in the brain and abnormal apoptotic features such as membrane blebbing or nuclear fragmentation.  A remarkable feature of these KO mice is that they have a very restricted phenotype: Casp3, 9, APAF-1 KO mice have deformations of neural tissue and FADD and Casp 8 KO showed defective heart development, however in both types of KO other organs developed normally and some cell types were still sensitive to apoptotic stimuli suggesting that unknown proapoptotic pathways exist.

==Methods for distinguishing apoptotic from necrotic (necroptotic) cells==
In order to perform analysis of apoptotic versus necrotic (necroptotic) cells, one can do analysis of morphology by [[time-lapse microscopy]], [[flow cytometry|flow fluorocytometry]], and [[transmission electron microscopy]]. There are  also various biochemical techniques for analysis of cell surface markers (phosphatidylserine exposure versus cell permeability by [[flow cytometry]]), cellular markers such as [[DNA fragmentation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lozano GM, Bejarano I, Espino J, González D, Ortiz A, García JF, Rodríguez AB, Pariente JA | year = 2009 | title = Density gradient capacitation is the most suitable method to improve fertilization and to reduce DNA fragmentation positive spermatozoa of infertile men | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259983025_Density_gradient_capacitation_is_the_most_suitable_method_to_improve_fertilization_and_to_reduce_DNA_fragmentation_positive_spermatozoa_of_infertile_men | journal = Anatolian Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology | volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 1–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (flow cytometry),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Darzynkiewicz Z, Juan G, Li X, Gorczyca W, Murakami T, Traganos F | title = Cytometry in cell necrobiology: analysis of apoptosis and accidental cell death (necrosis) | journal = Cytometry | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–20 | date = January 1997 | pmid = 9000580 | doi = 10.1002/(sici)1097-0320(19970101)27:1&lt;1::aid-cyto2&gt;3.3.co;2-x }}&lt;/ref&gt; caspase activation, Bid cleavage, and cytochrome c release ([[Western blot]]ting). It is important to know how primary and secondary necrotic cells can be distinguished by analysis of [[supernatant]] for caspases, HMGB1, and release of cytokeratin 18. However, no distinct surface or biochemical markers of necrotic cell death have been identified yet, and only negative markers are available. These include absence of apoptotic markers (caspase activation, cytochrome c release, and oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation) and differential kinetics of cell death markers (phosphatidylserine exposure and cell membrane permeabilization). A selection of techniques that can be used to distinguish apoptosis from necroptotic cells could be found in these references.&lt;ref name="methods"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Krysko DV, Vanden Berghe T, Parthoens E, D'Herde K, Vandenabeele P | title = Methods for distinguishing apoptotic from necrotic cells and measuring their clearance | journal = Methods in Enzymology | volume = 442 | pages = 307–41 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18662577 | doi = 10.1016/S0076-6879(08)01416-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="methods2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Krysko DV, Vanden Berghe T, D'Herde K, Vandenabeele P | title = Apoptosis and necrosis: detection, discrimination and phagocytosis | journal = Methods | volume = 44 | issue = 3 | pages = 205–21 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18314051 | doi = 10.1016/j.ymeth.2007.12.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="methods3"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vanden Berghe T, Grootjans S, Goossens V, Dondelinger Y, Krysko DV, Takahashi N, Vandenabeele P | title = Determination of apoptotic and necrotic cell death in vitro and in vivo | journal = Methods | volume = 61 | issue = 2 | pages = 117–29 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23473780 | doi = 10.1016/j.ymeth.2013.02.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wlodkowic D, Telford W, Skommer J, Darzynkiewicz Z | title = Apoptosis and beyond: cytometry in studies of programmed cell death | journal = Methods in Cell Biology | volume = 103 | issue =  | pages = 55–98 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21722800 | pmc = 3263828 | doi = 10.1016/B978-0-12-385493-3.00004-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defective pathways===
The many different types of apoptotic pathways contain a multitude of different biochemical components, many of them not yet understood.&lt;ref name="pathogenesis"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thompson CB | title = Apoptosis in the pathogenesis and treatment of disease | journal = Science | volume = 267 | issue = 5203 | pages = 1456–62 | date = March 1995 | pmid = 7878464 | doi = 10.1126/science.7878464 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a pathway is more or less sequential in nature, removing or modifying one component leads to an effect in another. In a living organism, this can have disastrous effects, often in the form of disease or disorder. A discussion of every disease caused by modification of the various apoptotic pathways would be impractical, but the concept overlying each one is the same: The normal functioning of the pathway has been disrupted in such a way as to impair the ability of the cell to undergo normal apoptosis. This results in a cell that lives past its "use-by-date" and is able to replicate and pass on any faulty machinery to its progeny, increasing the likelihood of the cell's becoming cancerous or diseased.

A recently described example of this concept in action can be seen in the development of a lung cancer called [[NCI-H460]].&lt;ref name="h460"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yang L, Mashima T, Sato S, Mochizuki M, Sakamoto H, Yamori T, Oh-Hara T, Tsuruo T | title = Predominant suppression of apoptosome by inhibitor of apoptosis protein in non-small cell lung cancer H460 cells: therapeutic effect of a novel polyarginine-conjugated Smac peptide | journal = Cancer Research | volume = 63 | issue = 4 | pages = 831–7 | date = February 2003 | pmid = 12591734 | doi =  | url = http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12591734 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein'' ([[XIAP]]) is [[Gene expression|overexpressed]] in cells of the H460 [[cell line]]. XIAPs bind to the processed form of caspase-9, and suppress the activity of apoptotic activator [[cytochrome c]], therefore overexpression leads to a decrease in the amount of proapoptotic agonists. As a consequence, the balance of anti-apoptotic and proapoptotic effectors is upset in favour of the former, and the damaged cells continue to replicate despite being directed to die. Defects in regulation of apoptosis in cancer cells occur often at the level of control of transcription factors. As a particular example, defects in molecules that control transcription factor NF-κB in cancer change the mode of transcriptional regulation and the response to apoptotic signals, to curtail dependence on the tissue that the cell belongs. This degree of independence from external survival signals, can enable cancer metastasis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vlahopoulos SA | title = Aberrant control of NF-κB in cancer permits transcriptional and phenotypic plasticity, to curtail dependence on host tissue: molecular mode | journal = Cancer Biology &amp; Medicine | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 254–270 | date = August 2017 | pmid = 28884042 | pmc = 5570602 | doi = 10.20892/j.issn.2095-3941.2017.0029 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dysregulation of p53====
The tumor-suppressor protein [[p53]] accumulates when DNA is damaged due to a chain of biochemical factors. Part of this pathway includes alpha-[[interferon]] and beta-interferon, which induce transcription of the ''p53'' gene, resulting in the increase of p53 protein level and enhancement of cancer cell-apoptosis.&lt;ref name="takaoka"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Takaoka A, Hayakawa S, Yanai H, Stoiber D, Negishi H, Kikuchi H, Sasaki S, Imai K, Shibue T, Honda K, Taniguchi T | title = Integration of interferon-alpha/beta signalling to p53 responses in tumour suppression and antiviral defence | journal = Nature | volume = 424 | issue = 6948 | pages = 516–23 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 12872134 | doi = 10.1038/nature01850 | displayauthors = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; p53 prevents the cell from replicating by stopping the [[cell cycle]] at G1, or interphase, to give the cell time to repair, however it will induce apoptosis if damage is extensive and repair efforts fail.&lt;ref name="pmid12052432"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bernstein C, Bernstein H, Payne CM, Garewal H | title = DNA repair/pro-apoptotic dual-role proteins in five major DNA repair pathways: fail-safe protection against carcinogenesis | journal = Mutation Research | volume = 511 | issue = 2 | pages = 145–78 | date = June 2002 | pmid = 12052432 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Any disruption to the regulation of the ''p53'' or interferon genes will result in impaired apoptosis and the possible formation of tumors.

===Inhibition===
Inhibition of apoptosis can result in a number of cancers, autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, and viral infections. It was originally believed that the associated accumulation of cells was due to an increase in cellular proliferation, but it is now known that it is also due to a decrease in cell death. The most common of these diseases is cancer, the disease of excessive cellular proliferation, which is often characterized by an overexpression of [[inhibitor of apoptosis|IAP]] family members. As a result, the malignant cells experience an abnormal response to apoptosis induction: Cycle-regulating genes (such as p53, ras or c-myc) are mutated or inactivated in diseased cells, and further genes (such as bcl-2) also modify their expression in tumors. Some apoptotic factors are vital during mitochondrial respiration e.g. cytochrome C.&lt;ref name="iopscience.iop.org"&gt;Kaczanowski, S.

The cell line was established by removing cells directly from [[Henrietta Lacks]], a cancer patent}} cells is inhibited by proteins produced by the cell; these inhibitory proteins target retinoblastoma tumor-suppressing proteins.&lt;ref name=DelPuerto/&gt; These tumor-suppressing proteins regulate the cell cycle, but are rendered inactive when bound to an inhibitory protein.&lt;ref name=DelPuerto/&gt; HPV E6 and E7 are inhibitory proteins expressed by the human papillomavirus, HPV being responsible for the formation of the cervical tumor from which HeLa cells are derived.&lt;ref name=Liu&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu HC, Chen GG, Vlantis AC, Tse GM, Chan AT, van Hasselt CA | title = Inhibition of apoptosis in human laryngeal cancer cells by E6 and E7 oncoproteins of human papillomavirus 16 | journal = Journal of Cellular Biochemistry | volume = 103 | issue = 4 | pages = 1125–43 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 17668439 | doi = 10.1002/jcb.21490 }}&lt;/ref&gt; HPV E6 causes p53, which regulates the cell cycle, to become inactive.&lt;ref name=Niu&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Niu XY, Peng ZL, Duan WQ, Wang H, Wang P | title = Inhibition of HPV 16 E6 oncogene expression by RNA interference in vitro and in vivo | journal = International Journal of Gynecological Cancer | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = 743–51 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16681755 | doi = 10.1111/j.1525-1438.2006.00384.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; HPV E7 binds to retinoblastoma tumor suppressing proteins and limits its ability to control cell division.&lt;ref name=Niu/&gt;  These two inhibitory proteins are partially responsible for HeLa cells' immortality by inhibiting apoptosis to occur.&lt;ref name="Liu McKalip"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu Y, McKalip A, Herman B | title = Human papillomavirus type 16 E6 and HPV-16 E6/E7 sensitize human keratinocytes to apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic agents: roles of p53 and caspase activation | journal = Journal of Cellular Biochemistry | volume = 78 | issue = 2 | pages = 334–49 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10842327 | doi = 10.1002/(sici)1097-4644(20000801)78:2&lt;334::aid-jcb15&gt;3.3.co;2-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CDV (Canine Distemper Virus) is able to induce apoptosis despite the presence of these inhibitory proteins. This is an important [[Oncolytic virus|oncolytic]] property of CDV: this virus is capable of killing canine lymphoma cells. Oncoproteins E6 and E7 still leave p53 inactive, but they are not able to avoid the activation of caspases induced from the stress of viral infection. These oncolytic properties provided a promising link between CDV and lymphoma apoptosis, which can lead to development of alternative treatment methods for both canine [[lymphoma]] and human non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Defects in the cell cycle are thought to be responsible for the resistance to chemotherapy or radiation by certain tumor cells, so a virus that can induce apoptosis despite defects in the cell cycle is useful for cancer treatment.&lt;ref name="Liu McKalip" /&gt;

====Treatments====
The main method of treatment for potential death from signaling-related diseases involves either increasing or decreasing the susceptibility of apoptosis in diseased cells, depending on whether the disease is caused by either the inhibition of or excess apoptosis. For instance, treatments aim to restore apoptosis to treat diseases with deficient cell death, and to increase the apoptotic threshold to treat diseases involved with excessive cell death. To stimulate apoptosis, one can increase the number of death receptor ligands (such as TNF or TRAIL), antagonize the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 pathway, or introduce Smac mimetics to inhibit the inhibitor (IAPs). The addition of agents such as Herceptin, Iressa, or Gleevec works to stop cells from cycling and causes apoptosis activation by blocking growth and survival signaling further upstream. Finally, adding p53-[[MDM2]] complexes displaces p53 and activates the p53 pathway, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Many different methods can be used either to stimulate or to inhibit apoptosis in various places along the death signaling pathway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Boehm I | title = Apoptosis in physiological and pathological skin: implications for therapy | journal = Current Molecular Medicine | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 375–94 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16900661 | doi = 10.2174/156652406777435390 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apoptosis is a multi-step, multi-pathway cell-death programme that is inherent in every cell of the body. In cancer, the apoptosis cell-division ratio is altered. Cancer treatment by chemotherapy and  irradiation kills target cells primarily by inducing apoptosis.

===Hyperactive apoptosis===
On the other hand, loss of control of cell death (resulting in excess apoptosis) can lead to neurodegenerative diseases, hematologic diseases, and tissue damage. It is of interest to note that neurons that rely on mitochondrial respiration undergo apoptosis in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s &lt;ref&gt;LaFerla, F. M., Tinkle, B. T., Bieberich, C. J., Haudenschild, C. C. &amp; Jay, G. The Alzheimer's A beta peptide induces neurodegeneration and apoptotic cell death in transgenic mice. Nat Genet 9, 21–30, {{doi|10.1038/ng0195-21}} (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; and Parkinson’s &lt;ref&gt;Mochizuki, H., Goto, K., Mori, H. &amp; Mizuno, Y. Histochemical detection of apoptosis in Parkinson's disease. J Neurol Sci 137, 120–123 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; (an observation known as the “Inverse Warburg hypothesis” &lt;ref&gt;Demetrius, L. A., Magistretti, P. J. &amp; Pellerin, L. Alzheimer's disease: the amyloid hypothesis and the Inverse Warburg effect. Front Physiol 5, 522, {{doi|10.3389/fphys.2014.00522}} (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iopscience.iop.org"/&gt; ). Moreover, there is an inverse epidemiological comorbidity between neurodegenerative diseases and cancer.&lt;ref&gt;Musicco, M. et al. Inverse occurrence of cancer and Alzheimer disease: a population-based incidence study. Neurology 81, 322–328, {{doi|10.1212/WNL.0b013e31829c5ec1}} (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; The progression of HIV is directly linked to excess, unregulated apoptosis.  In a healthy individual, the number of CD4+ lymphocytes is in balance with the cells generated by the bone marrow; however, in HIV-positive patients, this balance is lost due to an inability of the bone marrow to regenerate CD4+ cells.  In the case of HIV, CD4+ lymphocytes die at an accelerated rate through uncontrolled apoptosis, when stimulated.
At the molecular level, hyperactive apoptosis can be caused by defects in signaling pathways that regulate the Bcl-2 family proteins. Increased expression of apoptotic proteins such as BIM, or their decreased proteolysis, leads to cell death, and can cause a number of pathologies, depending on the cells where excessive activity of BIM occurs. Cancer cells can escape apoptosis through mechanisms that suppress BIM expression or by increased proteolysis of BIM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sionov RV, Vlahopoulos SA, Granot Z | title = Regulation of Bim in Health and Disease | journal = Oncotarget | volume = 6 | issue = 27 | pages = 23058–134 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 26405162 | pmc = 4695108 | doi = 10.18632/oncotarget.5492 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Treatments====
Treatments aiming to inhibit works to block specific caspases. Finally, the Akt protein kinase promotes cell survival through two pathways. Akt phosphorylates and inhibits Bad (a Bcl-2 family member), causing Bad to interact with the [[14-3-3]] scaffold, resulting in Bcl dissociation and thus cell survival. Akt also activates IKKα, which leads to NF-κB activation and cell survival. Active NF-κB induces the expression of anti-apoptotic genes such as Bcl-2, resulting in inhibition of apoptosis. NF-κB has been found to play both an antiapoptotic role and a proapoptotic role depending on the stimuli utilized and the cell type.&lt;ref name="Farhana, L. Cancer Research 2005;65:4909-4917"&gt;{{cite web |last=Farhana|first=Lulu|title=Apoptosis Induction by a Novel Retinoid-Related Molecule Requires Nuclear Factor- κB Activation|url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/65/11/4909.full.pdf|publisher=American Association of Cancer Research (AACR)|access-date=2012-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HIV progression===
The progression of the [[human immunodeficiency virus]] infection into [[AIDS]] is due primarily to the depletion of [[T helper cell|CD4+ T-helper lymphocytes]] in a manner that is too rapid for the body's bone marrow to replenish the cells, leading to a compromised immune system. One of the mechanisms by which T-helper cells are depleted is apoptosis, which results from a series of biochemical pathways:&lt;ref name="Judie"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Alimonti JB, Ball TB, Fowke KR | title = Mechanisms of CD4+ T lymphocyte cell death in human immunodeficiency virus infection and AIDS | journal = The Journal of General Virology | volume = 84 | issue = Pt 7 | pages = 1649–61 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 12810858 | doi = 10.1099/vir.0.19110-0 | url = http://vir.sgmjournals.org/cgi/content/full/84/7/1649 | access-date = 2006-12-18 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070113085738/http://vir.sgmjournals.org/cgi/content/full/84/7/1649# | archive-date = 2007-01-13 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# HIV enzymes deactivate anti-apoptotic ''Bcl-2''. This does not directly cause cell death but primes the cell for apoptosis should the appropriate signal be received.  In parallel, these enzymes activate proapoptotic ''procaspase-8'', which does directly activate the mitochondrial events of apoptosis.
# HIV may increase the level of cellular proteins that prompt Fas-mediated apoptosis.
# HIV proteins decrease the amount of [[CD4]] glycoprotein marker present on the cell membrane.
# Released viral particles and proteins present in extracellular fluid are able to induce apoptosis in nearby "bystander" T helper cells.
# HIV decreases the production of molecules involved in marking the cell for apoptosis, giving the virus time to replicate and continue releasing apoptotic agents and virions into the surrounding tissue.
# The infected CD4+ cell may also receive the death signal from a cytotoxic T cell.

Cells may also die as direct consequences of viral infections. HIV-1 expression induces tubular cell G2/M arrest and apoptosis.&lt;ref&gt;Vashistha H, Husain M, Kumar D, Yadav A, Arora S, Singhal PC. (2008) Ren Fail. 2008;30(6):655–64.&lt;/ref&gt;  The progression from HIV to AIDS is not immediate or even necessarily rapid; HIV's cytotoxic activity toward CD4+ lymphocytes is classified as AIDS once a given patient's CD4+ cell count falls below 200.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Indiana University Health |url=http://iuhealth.org/riley/infectious-diseases/hiv/aids-defining-criteria/ |title=AIDS Defining Criteria &amp;#124; Riley |publisher=IU Health |date= |access-date=2013-01-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526052627/http://iuhealth.org/riley/infectious-diseases/hiv/aids-defining-criteria/# |archive-date=2013-05-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers from Kumamoto University in Japan have developed a new method to eradicate HIV in viral reservoir cells, named "Lock-in and apoptosis." Using the synthesized compound Heptanoylphosphatidyl L-Inositol Pentakisphophate (or L-Hippo) to bind strongly to the HIV protein PR55Gag, they were able to suppress viral budding. By suppressing viral budding, the researchers were able to trap the HIV virus in the cell and allow for the cell to undergo apoptosis (natural cell death). Associate Professor Mikako Fujita has stated that the approach is not yet available to HIV patients because the research team has to conduct further research on combining the drug therapy that currently exists with this "Lock-in and apoptosis" approach to lead to complete recovery from HIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tateishi H, Monde K, Anraku K, Koga R, Hayashi Y, Ciftci HI, DeMirci H, Higashi T, Motoyama K, Arima H, Otsuka M, Fujita M | title = A clue to unprecedented strategy to HIV eradication: "Lock-in and apoptosis" | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 8957 | date = August 2017 | pmid = 28827668 | doi = 10.1038/s41598-017-09129-w | url = https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-09129-w }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Viral infection===
Viral induction of apoptosis occurs when one or several cells of a living organism are&lt;!--plural predicate to agree with "cells"--&gt; infected with a [[virus]], leading to cell death. Cell death in organisms is necessary for the normal development of cells and the cell cycle maturation.&lt;ref name=Indran&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Indran IR, Tufo G, Pervaiz S, Brenner C | title = Recent advances in apoptosis, mitochondria and drug resistance in cancer cells | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1807 | issue = 6 | pages = 735–45 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21453675 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbabio.2011.03.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also important in maintaining the regular functions and activities of cells.

Viruses can trigger apoptosis of infected cells via a range of mechanisms including:
*Receptor binding
*Activation of [[protein kinase R]] (PKR)
*Interaction with p53
*Expression of viral proteins coupled to MHC proteins on the surface of the infected cell, allowing recognition by cells of the immune system (such as Natural Killer and cytotoxic T cells) that then induce the infected cell to undergo apoptosis.&lt;ref name=Everett&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Everett H, McFadden G | title = Apoptosis: an innate immune response to virus infection | journal = Trends in Microbiology | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = 160–5 | date = April 1999 | pmid = 10217831 | doi = 10.1016/S0966-842X(99)01487-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Canine distemper virus]] (CDV) is known to cause apoptosis in central nervous system and lymphoid tissue of infected dogs in vivo and in vitro.&lt;ref name=Nishi&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nishi T, Tsukiyama-Kohara K, Togashi K, Kohriyama N, Kai C | title = Involvement of apoptosis in syncytial cell death induced by canine distemper virus | journal = Comparative Immunology, Microbiology and Infectious Diseases | volume = 27 | issue = 6 | pages = 445–55 | date = November 2004 | pmid = 15325517 | doi = 10.1016/j.cimid.2004.01.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Apoptosis caused by CDV is typically induced via the [[death-inducing signaling complex|extrinsic pathway]], which activates [[caspases]] that disrupt cellular function and eventually leads to the cells death.&lt;ref name=DelPuerto&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Del Puerto HL, Martins AS, Milsted A, Souza-Fagundes EM, Braz GF, Hissa B, Andrade LO, Alves F, Rajão DS, Leite RC, Vasconcelos AC | title = Canine distemper virus induces apoptosis in cervical tumor derived cell lines | journal = Virology Journal | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 334 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21718481 | pmc = 3141686 | doi = 10.1186/1743-422X-8-334 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In normal cells, CDV activates caspase-8 first, which works as the initiator protein followed by the executioner protein caspase-3.&lt;ref name=DelPuerto/&gt;  However, apoptosis induced by CDV in HeLa cells does not involve the initiator protein caspase-8. HeLa cell apoptosis caused by CDV follows a different mechanism than that in vero cell lines.&lt;ref name=DelPuerto/&gt;  This change in the caspase cascade suggests CDV induces apoptosis via the [[intrinsic apoptosis|intrinsic pathway]], excluding the need for the initiator caspase-8. The executioner protein is instead activated by the internal stimuli caused by viral infection not a caspase cascade.&lt;ref name=DelPuerto/&gt;

The [[Oropouche virus]] (OROV) is found in the family ''[[Bunyaviridae]]''. The study of apoptosis brought on by ''Bunyaviridae'' was initiated in 1996, when it was observed that apoptosis was induced by the La Crosse virus into the kidney cells of baby hamsters and into the brains of baby mice.&lt;ref name=Acrani&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Acrani GO, Gomes R, Proença-Módena JL, da Silva AF, Carminati PO, Silva ML, Santos RI, Arruda E | title = Apoptosis induced by Oropouche virus infection in HeLa cells is dependent on virus protein expression | journal = Virus Research | volume = 149 | issue = 1 | pages = 56–63 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 20080135 | doi = 10.1016/j.virusres.2009.12.013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

OROV is a disease that is transmitted between humans by the biting midge (''[[Culicoides paraensis]]'').&lt;ref name=Azevedo&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Azevedo RS, Nunes MR, Chiang JO, Bensabath G, Vasconcelos HB, Pinto AY, Martins LC, Monteiro HA, Rodrigues SG, Vasconcelos PF | title = Reemergence of Oropouche fever, northern Brazil | journal = Emerging Infectious Diseases | volume = 13 | issue = 6 | pages = 912–5 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17553235 | pmc = 2792853 | doi = 10.3201/eid1306.061114 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is referred to as a [[zoonotic]] [[arbovirus]] and causes febrile illness, characterized by the onset of a sudden fever known as Oropouche fever.&lt;ref name=Santos&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Santos RI, Rodrigues AH, Silva ML, Mortara RA, Rossi MA, Jamur MC, Oliver C, Arruda E | title = Oropouche virus entry into HeLa cells involves clathrin and requires endosomal acidification | journal = Virus Research | volume = 138 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 139–43 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 18840482 | doi = 10.1016/j.virusres.2008.08.016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Oropouche virus also causes disruption in cultured cells – cells that are cultivated in distinct and specific conditions. An example of this can be seen in [[HeLa cells]], whereby the cells begin to degenerate shortly after they are infected.&lt;ref name=Acrani/&gt;

With the use of [[gel electrophoresis]], it can be observed that OROV causes [[DNA]] fragmentation in HeLa cells. It can be interpreted by counting, measuring, and analyzing the cells of the Sub/G1 cell population.&lt;ref name=Acrani/&gt; When HeLA cells are infected with OROV, the [[cytochrome C]] is released from the membrane of the mitochondria, into the cytosol of the cells. This type of interaction shows that apoptosis is activated via an intrinsic pathway.&lt;ref name=Indran/&gt;

In order for apoptosis to occur within OROV, viral uncoating, viral internalization, along with the replication of cells is necessary. Apoptosis in some viruses is activated by extracellular stimuli. However, studies have demonstrated that the OROV infection causes apoptosis to be activated through intracellular stimuli and involves the mitochondria.&lt;ref name=Acrani/&gt;

Many viruses encode proteins that can inhibit apoptosis.&lt;ref name=Teodora&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Teodoro JG, Branton PE | title = Regulation of apoptosis by viral gene products | journal = Journal of Virology | volume = 71 | issue = 3 | pages = 1739–46 | date = March 1997 | pmid = 9032302 | pmc = 191242 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several viruses encode viral homologs of Bcl-2. These homologs can inhibit proapoptotic proteins such as BAX and BAK, which are essential for the activation of apoptosis. Examples of viral Bcl-2 proteins include the [[Epstein-Barr virus]] BHRF1 protein and the [[adenovirus]] E1B 19K protein.&lt;ref name=Polster&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Polster BM, Pevsner J, Hardwick JM | title = Viral Bcl-2 homologs and their role in virus replication and associated diseases | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1644 | issue = 2-3 | pages = 211–27 | date = March 2004 | pmid = 14996505 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbamcr.2003.11.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some viruses express caspase inhibitors that inhibit caspase activity and an example is the CrmA protein of cowpox viruses. Whilst a number of viruses can block the effects of TNF and Fas. For example, the M-T2 protein of myxoma viruses can bind TNF preventing it from binding the TNF receptor and inducing a response.&lt;ref name=Hay&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hay S, Kannourakis G | title = A time to kill: viral manipulation of the cell death program | journal = The Journal of General Virology | volume = 83 | issue = Pt 7 | pages = 1547–64 | date = July 2002 | pmid = 12075073 | doi = 10.1099/0022-1317-83-7-1547 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.322.6923 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, many viruses express p53 inhibitors that can bind p53 and inhibit its transcriptional transactivation activity. As a consequence, p53 cannot induce apoptosis, since it cannot induce the expression of proapoptotic proteins. The adenovirus E1B-55K protein and the [[hepatitis B virus]] HBx protein are examples of viral proteins that can perform such a function.&lt;ref name=Wang&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang XW, Gibson MK, Vermeulen W, Yeh H, Forrester K, Stürzbecher HW, Hoeijmakers JH, Harris CC | title = Abrogation of p53-induced apoptosis by the hepatitis B virus X gene | journal = Cancer Research | volume = 55 | issue = 24 | pages = 6012–6 | date = December 1995 | pmid = 8521383 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Viruses can remain intact from apoptosis in particular in the latter stages of infection. They can be exported in the ''apoptotic bodies'' that pinch off from the surface of the dying cell, and the fact that they are engulfed by phagocytes prevents the initiation of a host response. This favours the spread of the virus.&lt;ref name="Hay"/&gt;

==Plants==
[[Programmed cell death]] in plants has a number of molecular similarities to that of animal apoptosis, but it also has differences, notable ones being the presence of a [[cell wall]] and the lack of an [[immune system]] that removes the pieces of the dead cell.  Instead of an immune response, the dying cell synthesizes substances to break itself down and places them in a [[vacuole]] that ruptures as the cell dies.  Whether this whole process resembles animal apoptosis closely enough to warrant using the name ''apoptosis'' (as opposed to the more general ''programmed cell death'') is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://elfosscientiae.cigb.edu.cu/PDFs/BA/2006/23/1/BA002301RV001-010.pdf | title = Programmed cell death in plants resembles apoptosis of animals | first1 = Cyrelys | last1 = Collazo | first2 = Osmani | last2 = Chacón | first3 = Orlando | last3 = Borrás | name-list-format = vanc | journal = Biotecnología Aplicada | year = 2006 | volume = 23 | pages = 1–10 | deadurl = yes | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090303235946/http://elfosscientiae.cigb.edu.cu/PDFs/BA/2006/23/1/BA002301RV001-010.pdf | archive-date = 2009-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Caspase-independent apoptosis==
The characterization of the caspases allowed the development of caspase inhibitors, which can be used to determine whether a cellular process involves active caspases. Using these inhibitors it was discovered that cells can die while displaying a morphology similar to apoptosis without caspase activation.&lt;ref name="pmid8962091"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Xiang J, Chao DT, Korsmeyer SJ | title = BAX-induced cell death may not require interleukin 1 beta-converting enzyme-like proteases | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 93 | issue = 25 | pages = 14559–63 | date = December 1996 | pmid = 8962091 | pmc = 26172 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later studies linked this phenomenon to the release of AIF ([[apoptosis-inducing factor]]) from the mitochondria and its translocation into the nucleus mediated by its NLS (nuclear localization signal). Inside the mitochondria, AIF is anchored to the inner membrane. In order to be released, the protein is cleaved by a calcium-dependent [[Calpain|calpain protease]].

'''Ashoka's Hell''' was, according to legend, an elaborate [[torture chamber]] disguised as a beautiful palace full of amenities such as exclusive baths and decorated with flowers,  fruit trees and  ornaments. It was built by Emperor [[Ashoka]] (304–232 BCE) in [[Pataliputra]] (modern [[Patna]], [[India]]), the capital city of the [[Maurya Empire]]. The legend of the torture palace is detailed in the ''[[Ashokavadana]]'', the text that describes Emperor Ashoka's life through both legendary and historical accounts.

According to legend, the palatial torture chamber was artfully designed to make its exterior visually pleasing and was referred to as the "beautiful gaol". Beneath the veneer of beauty, however, deep inside the  exclusive mansion, torture chambers were constructed  which were full of sadistic and cruel instruments of [[torture]] including furnaces producing molten metal for pouring on prisoners.

The narrative mentions that the architect of the chamber was inspired by descriptions of the five tortures of the [[Buddhist hell]] for the design of the torture chamber and of the torture methods he inflicted upon his victims. The text of the ''Ashokavadana'', describes how the torture chamber was so terrifying, it caused people to believe that Ashoka had visited hell itself in his quest to perfect its evil design. Through a pact made between Ashoka and the official executioner of the torture chamber anyone entering the palace, even by chance as a visitor, was not allowed to come out alive.

==Background==
According to the narrations of ''[[Ashokavadana]]'', Emperor [[Ashoka]], prior to his conversion to Buddhism, was a fierce and sadistic ruler, known as ''Ashoka the Fierce'', or Chandashoka (Ashoka the Cruel),&lt;ref name="Obeyesekere2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gananath Obeyesekere|title=Imagining Karma: Ethical Transformation in Amerindian, Buddhist, and Greek Rebirth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yllblMkRgMMC&amp;pg=PA172|accessdate=18 April 2013|year=2002|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-23243-3|pages=172–173}}&lt;/ref&gt; who sent his minions on a quest to find a vicious man to work as his official executioner.&lt;ref name="Rich2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A History Of Ancient India"/&gt;

After some searching, Ashoka's men found a suitable candidate by the name of Girika who was so vicious that he killed his own parents because they did not want him to become Ashoka's executioner. Girika was introduced to Ashoka who soon appointed him as the official executioner of  his Empire.&lt;ref name="Rich2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A History Of Ancient India"/&gt;

==Design==
According to legend, Girika persuaded Ashoka to design the torture chamber based on the suffering endured by people reborn in [[Buddhist hell]].&lt;ref name="Scharfstein1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ben-Ami Scharfstein|title=Amoral Politics: The Persistent Truth of Machiavellism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ibkxwtmP7_UC&amp;pg=PA61|accessdate=18 April 2013|year=1995|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-1-4384-1886-5|pages=61–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Ashokavadana'' documents a long list of torture acts Girika designed and planned to force upon his prisoners including "prying  open their mouths with an iron and pouring boiling copper down their throats".&lt;ref name="Rich2010"/&gt; Innocent persons were not exempt from such treatment.&lt;ref name="Alahakōn1980"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hekṭar Alahakōn|title=The Later Mauryas: 232 BC to 180 BC|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gR4dAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=22 April 2013|year=1980|publisher=Munshiram Manoharla|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the narrative of ''Ashokavadana'', Ashoka asked Girika to disguise the torture chamber as a beautiful and "enticing" palace full of amenities such as exclusive baths and to decorate it with flowers, fruit trees and many ornaments. The palatial torture chamber was artfully designed to make people long to just look at it, and even attract them to enter, and was  referred to as the "beautiful gaol".&lt;ref name="Obeyesekere2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rich2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gurugé1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ananda W.

According to the mythology, beneath the veneer of beauty, inside the exclusive mansion, torture chambers were constructed  which were full of the most sadistic and cruel instruments of torture including furnaces producing molten metal for pouring on the prisoners.&lt;ref name="Rich2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scharfstein1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SaranMishi2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mishi Saran|author2=Mishi|title=Chasing the Monk's Shadow|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2hkOBNbnOGYC&amp;pg=PA274|accessdate=18 April 2013|date=1 July 2012|publisher=Penguin Books India|isbn=978-0-14-306439-8|page=274}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thapar1973"/&gt;

In the narrative, Ashoka made a pact with Girika that he would never allow anyone who entered the palace to exit alive, including Ashoka himself.&lt;ref name="Rich2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scharfstein1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SaranMishi2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Durant2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Legend of King Ashoka"/&gt; The torture chamber was so terrifying, that Emperor Ashoka was thought to have visited [[hell]] so that he could perfect its evil design.&lt;ref name="Vittachi2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nury Vittachi|title=The Kama Sutra of Business: Management Principles from Indian Classics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xK5CBu0UBygC&amp;pg=PT162|accessdate=18 April 2013|date=13 April 2007|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-82223-4|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Biographical Sutra of Emperor Ashoka'' the palace is described by the sentence: 'Emperor Ashoka constructed a hell'.&lt;ref name="Brazier2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Brazier|title=The New Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v-zNSbmOjVIC&amp;pg=PA59|accessdate=18 April 2013|date=1 June 2002|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-312-29518-9|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ashokavadana'' refers to Girika as Chandagirika or Girika the Cruel. It appears that Girika overheard a Buddhist monk recite the ''Balapanditasutta'' which contains vivid descriptions of the five tortures of hell, such as:&lt;ref name="Obeyesekere2002"/&gt; {{quotation|Finally, there are beings who are reborn in hell whom the hell-guardians grab, and stretch out on their backs on a fiery floor of red-hot iron that is but a mass of flames. Then they carry out the torture of the five-fold tether; they drive two iron stakes through their hands; they drive  two iron stakes through their feet; and  they drive one iron stake through their heart. Truly, O monks, hell is a place of great suffering}} and got his ideas of how to torture prisoners from there. The text describes Girika's attitude toward punishment as follows: "Such are the five great agonies, Girika reflected, and he began to inflict these same tortures on people in his prison". In addition the ''Balapanditasutta'' compares the King's torture methods to the tortures of hell.&lt;ref name="Obeyesekere2002"/&gt;

==Miracles in the chamber==
The ''Ashokavadana'' further mentions that sometime later a Buddhist monk by the name of [[Samudra]] happened to visit the palace and upon entering he was informed by Girika that he would be tortured to death,&lt;ref name="The Legend of King Ashoka"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Legend of King Ashoka: A Study and Translation of the Ashokavadana|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kp9uaQTQ8h8C&amp;pg=PA73|accessdate=18 April 2013|year=1989|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|isbn=978-81-208-0616-0|pages=73–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ConferenceSharma2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Indian Society for Buddhist Studies.

His torturers however failed to injure him and he appeared able to neutralise their torture methods by realising that the suffering of the other prisoners is part of the  Buddhist dogma of suffering and attaining [[arhatship]].&lt;ref name="Rich2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A History Of Ancient India"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Legend of King Ashoka"/&gt;

A particular narration detailed how Samudra, while tortured in a cauldron full of boiling water, human blood, [[bone marrow]] and excrement, caused the contents of the cauldron to cool down and then sat meditating cross-legged on a [[Nelumbo|lotus]] sprouting from the fluid.&lt;ref name="Rich2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A History Of Ancient India"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Legend of King Ashoka"/&gt;

The narrative further describes that when Ashoka heard of these miracles, he was overcome with curiosity and decided to enter the chamber to verify for himself the veracity of the stories. After arriving there he witnessed Samudra levitating with half his body on fire and the other half raining water.&lt;ref name="Rich2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A History Of Ancient India"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Legend of King Ashoka"/&gt;  Intrigued he asked Samudra to identify himself.&lt;ref name="The Legend of King Ashoka"/&gt;

Samudra replied that he was a disciple of Buddha and adherent to the [[Dharma]]. Samudra then chastised Ashoka for having built the torture chamber and further instructed him to build eighty four thousand [[stupas]] according to Buddha's prophecy, and to guarantee the security of all beings. To those demands, Ashoka acquiesced. Further he confessed to his crimes and accepted Buddha and the [[Dharma]].&lt;ref name="The Legend of King Ashoka"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DockettDudley-Grant2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kathleen H.

==Demolition==
The ''Ashokavadana'' describes the events leading to the demolition of Ashoka's torture chamber. According to the text, the torture chamber had become the site and the reason of his conversion to Buddhism. Girika, as the resident executioner of the chamber, however, reminded Ashoka of his pledge to kill anyone entering the chamber including Ashoka himself.&lt;ref name="Rich2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A History Of Ancient India"/&gt;

Ashoka then questioned Girika as to who entered the torture palace first during their visit to see Samudra's miracles. Girika was then forced to admit that it was he who entered first. Upon the executioner's  confession, Ashoka ordered him burnt alive and also ordered the demolition of the torture palace. According to the ''Ashokavadana'', "the beautiful jail was then torn down and a guarantee of security was extended to all beings".&lt;ref name="Rich2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A History Of Ancient India"/&gt;

From that point on,  Ashoka became known as ''Ashoka the Pious''.&lt;ref name="Rich2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruce Rich|title=To Uphold the World: A Call for a New Global Ethic from Ancient India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c9ZoeR3r7ngC&amp;pg=PT147|accessdate=18 April 2013|date=1 March 2010|publisher=Beacon Press|isbn=978-0-8070-9553-9|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A History Of Ancient India"&gt;{{cite book|title=A History Of Ancient And Early Medieval India: From The Stone Age To The 12Th Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H3lUIIYxWkEC&amp;pg=PA332|accessdate=18 April 2013|date=1 September 2008|publisher=Pearson Education India|isbn=978-81-317-1120-0|page=332}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhist monk [[Xuanzang]] in his writings mentions that in the 7th century AD he had visited the place where Ashoka's  torture chamber once was and that it was, even at that time, referred to in Hindu tradition as "Ashoka's Hell".&lt;ref name="A History Of Ancient India"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Durant2011"/&gt; Xuanzang also claimed that he saw the column identifying the location of Ashoka's Hell.&lt;ref name="Thapar1973"&gt;{{cite book|author=Romila Thapar|title=Aśoka and the Decline of the Mauryas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ntDAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=ashoka+hell+on+earth&amp;dq=ashoka+hell+on+earth&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=scl0UYO8E4WR0QG0vIFA&amp;redir_esc=y|accessdate=22 April 2013|year=1973|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=29|quote=Fa-hsien repeats the story and explains that Ashoka personally visited the infernal regions and studied their methods of torture before inventing his own.1 Hsiian Tsang claims to have actually seen the pillar marking the site of Ashoka's 'Hell'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[India]], the palace is known as "Ashoka's Hell" and its location near [[Pataliputra]] became a popular destination for pilgrims. In the 5th century, AD [[Faxian]], who was also a Buddhist monk, also reports visiting it and his account of the story of the palace differs slightly from that of Xuanzang's.&lt;ref name="Durant2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Will Durant|title=Our Oriental Heritage: The Story of Civilization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ru4LPyMAxxkC&amp;pg=PT707|accessdate=18 April 2013|date=7 June 2011|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=978-1-4516-4668-9|pages=707}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Legend of King Ashoka"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SchlagerLauer2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Neil Schlager|author2=Josh Lauer|title=Science and its times: understanding the social significance of scientific discovery|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OYU-AQAAIAAJ|accessdate=18 April 2013|year=2001|publisher=Gale Group|isbn=978-0-7876-3933-4|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1890s, British explorer [[Laurence Waddell]],  while in [[Patna]], established that [[Agam Kuan]], which means the "unfathomable well", was part of Ashoka's Hell as reported also by the two Chinese  monks.&lt;ref name=doa&gt;{{cite web |title=Agam Kuan |url=http://yac.bih.nic.in/Da-01.htm#AgamKuan |publisher=Directorate of Archaeology, Govt. of Bihar, official website |accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Material Life of Northern India: Based on an Archaeological Study, 3rd Century B.C. to 1st Century B.C.|author= Asha Vishnu|publisher=Mittal Publications |year=1993|isbn=8170994101 |page=173 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zaJ5oyrqBakC&amp;pg=PA173&amp;dq=Agam+Kuan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=m7FwUYvUBIarrAebvICABg&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Agam%20Kuan&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="India Perspectives"&gt;{{cite book|title=India Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iqqyAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=22 April 2013|year=2003|publisher=PTI for the Ministry of External Affairs|page=13|quote=A little distance away is another Ashokan remain, the Agam Kuan or the fathomless well which is believed to be a part of the legendary hell created by ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KuraishiIndia1931"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mohammad Hamid Kuraishi|author2=Archaeological Survey of India|title=List of ancient monuments protected under Act VII of 1904 in the province of Bihar and Orissa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uOwLfHIYK8gC&amp;q=Agam+Kuan+hell&amp;dq=Agam+Kuan+hell&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ScB1Udb8JZOP0QHZq4GICg&amp;sqi=2&amp;redir_esc=y|accessdate=22 April 2013|year=1931|publisher=Govt. of India, Central Publication Branch|page=96|quote=Waddell, the Agam Kuan " seems to be a vestige of Ashoka's hell,...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3613">'''Capital punishment''' is abolished in the federal '''District of Columbia'''. However, a number of executions were carried out under the District's jurisdiction before abolition. These executions should be distinguished from cases such as the [[Operation Pastorius|1942 execution of the six Nazi saboteurs]] which took place in the District, but [[Capital punishment by the United States federal government|under the jurisdiction of the Federal Government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bop.gov/about/history/execchart.jsp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215022029/http://www.bop.gov/about/history/execchart.jsp |archivedate=2013-02-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Before 1973, the [[District of Columbia]] was exclusively governed by the [[United States Congress]], which included establishing all local laws. Until 1962, D.C. was the last jurisdiction in the [[United States]] with mandatory death sentences for first-degree murder (the last state with mandatory death sentences for first degree murder was [[Vermont]]). Mandatory death sentences were abolished by the HR5143 (PL87-423), signed into law by President [[John F. Kennedy]] on March 22, 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jfklibrary.org/Research/Ready-Reference/Legislative-Summary-Main-Page/Legislative-Summary/District-of-Columbia.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006101131/http://www.jfklibrary.org/Research/Ready-Reference/Legislative-Summary-Main-Page/Legislative-Summary/District-of-Columbia.aspx |archivedate=2012-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rape was also a capital offense.&lt;ref name="deathpenaltyinfo1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/documents/ESPYstate.pdf |format=PDF |title=Executions is the U.S. 1608-2002: The ESPY File : Executions by State |website=Deathpenaltyinfo.org |accessdate=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The D.C. [[capital punishment]] law was nullified by the [[United States Supreme Court]] decision in ''[[Furman v. Georgia]]'' in 1972 and formally repealed by the [[D.C. Council]] in 1981. In the 1992 Congress-ordered referendum, District residents voted against reinstating the death penalty (the District is a [[Political party strength in Washington, D.C.|liberal stronghold]] which usually give at least 85% of its votes to the Democratic candidate in presidential elections). In 1997, [[Mayor of Washington, D.C.|Mayor]] [[Marion Barry]] proposed a bill allowing capital punishment for the murder of public safety employees, which was rejected by the Council's Judiciary Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/district-columbia |title=District of Columbia &amp;#124; Death Penalty Information Center |website=Deathpenaltyinfo.org |date= |accessdate=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recorded execution in Washington, was the [[hanging]] of James McGirk in 1802. The last execution under the authority of the District took place in 1957, when Robert Carter was put to death by electrocution.

Hanging was the method of execution that had been used in the District until 1928, when it was replaced by the electric chair, last used in 1957.&lt;ref name="deathpenaltyinfo1"/&gt; 

The [[President of the United States]] has sole pardoning power in the District.

'''Carl Scarborough''' (July 3, 1914 – May 30, 1953) was an [[United States|American]] [[racecar]] driver. He died from [[hyperthermia|heat exhaustion]] during the [[1953 Indianapolis 500]], a race in which several drivers experienced heat-related illness. The race was Scarborough's second entry in the Indianapolis 500. He had also been the national champion in both big car and [[midget car racing]]. After he died, race officials announced plans to inspect Indy 500 vehicles for suitable ventilation.

Scarborough was born in [[Benton, Illinois]] on July 3, 1914.&lt;ref name=F1&gt;{{cite web|title=Carl Scarborough|url=http://en.espnf1.com/f1/motorsport/driver/546.html|publisher=ESPN F1|accessdate=November 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before his entries in the Indianapolis 500, he had participated in "outlaw" racing in Michigan, Indiana and Ohio.&lt;ref name=Reed/&gt; Early in his racing career, Scarborough sat out for two years after sustaining injuries as the passenger in a car crash.&lt;ref name=F1/&gt; In 1946, Scarborough was the national [[midget car racing]] champion.&lt;ref name=Record&gt;{{cite news|title=Carl Scarborough shatters record|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=CvxOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6v8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4748,2770543|accessdate=November 29, 2013|newspaper=[[Toledo Blade]]|date=July 3, 1947}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also won the national big car title that year, becoming the first driver named the Central States Racing Association national champion in both categories.&lt;ref name=F1/&gt;

While attempting to qualify for the [[1951 Indianapolis 500]], he ran the second fastest qualifying lap that had ever been recorded at the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]].&lt;ref name=SDC&gt;{{cite news|title=Test second fastest|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9-VXAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=L_YDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1872,1187376|accessdate=November 29, 2013|newspaper=[[Spokane Daily Chronicle]]|date=May 19, 1951}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished 18th in that race; within four years, eleven of the 35 men in the 1951 race's starting lineup had died, mostly in race-related incidents.&lt;ref name=Rookie&gt;{{cite news|title=Rookie drivers hike speed mortalities|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=mIUeAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hcsEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2132,3231428|accessdate=November 29, 2013|newspaper=[[The Daytona Beach News-Journal]]|date=May 26, 1955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Scarborough started the [[1953 Indianapolis 500]] on the seventh row. He qualified for the race with an average speed of 135.936 miles per hour.&lt;ref name=Starting&gt;{{cite news |title = Starting lineup at Indianapolis |url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TEohAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=WoEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1234,4602775 |accessdate = November 29, 2013 |newspaper = [[Schenectady Gazette]] |date = May 26, 1953 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During Scarborough's first [[pit stop]], he felt sick from the heat and fumes at the race. After a fuel spill during the pit stop, a minor fire broke out involving the side of Scarborough's car. Scarborough climbed over the pit wall and collapsed onto a chair.&lt;ref name=Reed&gt;{{cite book |last = Reed |first = Terry |title = Indy: The Race and Ritual of the Indianapolis 500 |year = 2005 |publisher = Potomac Books |isbn = 1574889079 |page = 163 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Pzm24e5toEMC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;dq=carl+scarborough+indianapolis+500&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BD6ZUpL-ApPYoASSm4CIAQ&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Bob Scott (racing driver)|Bob Scott]] replaced Scarborough on the track.&lt;ref name=Autocourse/&gt; Scott's own car had experienced mechanical difficulties early in the race.

'''Cass Elliot''' (born '''Ellen Naomi Cohen'''; September 19, 1941 – July 29, 1974), also known as '''Mama Cass''', was an American [[singing|singer]] and actress, best known as a member of [[the Mamas &amp; the Papas]]. After the group broke up, she released five solo albums. In 1998 she was posthumously inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] for her work with the Mamas &amp; the Papas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/the-mamas-and-the-papas|title=Inductee Explorer - Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame|website=Rockhall.com|accessdate=December 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Ellen Naomi Cohen was born in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], the daughter of Philip Cohen (d: 1962) and his wife Bess (née Levine, 1915–1994).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rasmussen|first1=Fred|title=Bess Cohen, was mother of Mama Cass|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1994-04-02/news/1994092046_1_cohen-mama-cass-bess|accessdate=March 27, 2018|work=The Baltimore Sun|date=April 2, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Both her parents were the children of Jewish immigrants from the [[Russian Empire]]. Elliot's  family was subject to significant financial stresses and uncertainties during her childhood years.  Her father, involved in several business ventures throughout his life, ultimately succeeded through the development of a [[lunch wagon]] business in Baltimore, providing meals to construction workers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.panmacmillan.com/authors/eddi-fiegel Eddi Fiegel], ''[https://www.panmacmillan.com/authors/eddi-fiegel/dream-a-little-dream-of-me  Dream a Little Dream of Me:  The Life of 'Mama' Cass Elliott]'' ([[Sidgwick &amp; Jackson]], 2005; [[Pan Macmillan]], 2006), pp. 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother was a trained nurse.&lt;ref name="Haaretz.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/features/this-day-in-jewish-history/.premium-1.607677|title=This Day in Jewish History: Singer Cass Elliot Dies|first=David B.|last=Green|date=29 July 2014|accessdate=21 May 2017|work=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elliot had a brother Joseph and a younger sister [[Leah Kunkel|Leah]], professionally known as [[Leah Kunkel]], who also became a singer and recording artist, as a member of the [[Coyote Sisters]] and also as a solo artist and background vocalist.  Elliot's early life was spent with her family in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], before the family moved to Baltimore, when Elliot was fifteen, and where they had briefly lived at the time of Elliot's birth.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.panmacmillan.com/authors/eddi-fiegel Eddi Fiegel], ''[https://www.panmacmillan.com/authors/eddi-fiegel/dream-a-little-dream-of-me  Dream a Little Dream of Me:  The Life of 'Mama' Cass Elliott]'' ([[Sidgwick &amp; Jackson]], 2005; [[Pan Macmillan]], 2006), pp. 19, 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Elliot adopted the name "Cass" in high school, possibly borrowing it from actress [[Peggy Cass]], as [[Denny Doherty]] tells it. She assumed the surname Elliot some time later, in memory of a friend who had died. While in Alexandria, Virginia, Elliot attended [[George Washington Middle School (Virginia)|George Washington High School]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.panmacmillan.com/authors/eddi-fiegel Eddi Fiegel], ''[https://www.panmacmillan.com/authors/eddi-fiegel/dream-a-little-dream-of-me Dream a Little Dream of Me:  The Life of 'Mama' Cass Elliott]'' ([[Sidgwick &amp; Jackson]], 2005; [[Pan Macmillan]], 2006), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; which [[Jim Morrison]] of [[the Doors]] also attended.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Remembering the Lizard King: Classmates Remember the Jim Morrison They Knew|url=http://archives.waiting-forthe-sun.net/Pages/Articles/lizard_king_remembered.html||website=Waiting-forthe-sun.net|access-date=2016-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarification needed|reason=Were they contempories?|date=January 2018}} When Elliot's family returned to Baltimore, she attended [[Forest Park High School (Maryland)|Forest Park High School]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.panmacmillan.com/authors/eddi-fiegel Eddi Fiegel], ''[https://www.panmacmillan.com/authors/eddi-fiegel/dream-a-little-dream-of-me  Dream a Little Dream of Me:  The Life of 'Mama' Cass Elliott]'' ([[Sidgwick &amp; Jackson]], 2005; [[Pan Macmillan]], 2006), pp. 21-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

While attending Forest Park High School, Elliot became interested in acting. She won a small part in the play ''[[The Boy Friend (musical)|The Boy Friend]]'', a [[summer stock]] production at the [[Parkway Theatre (Baltimore)|Hilltop Theatre]] in [[Owings Mills, Maryland]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.panmacmillan.com/authors/eddi-fiegel Eddi Fiegel], ''[https://www.panmacmillan.com/authors/eddi-fiegel/dream-a-little-dream-of-me  Dream a Little Dream of Me: The Life of 'Mama' Cass Elliott]'' ([[Sidgwick &amp; Jackson]], 2005; [[Pan Macmillan]], 2006), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; She left high school shortly before graduation and moved to [[New York City]] to further her acting career (as recounted in the lyrics to "[[Creeque Alley]]").

==Early career==
[[File:CassElliotLP1.jpg|left|thumb|Cass Elliot with [[Tim Rose]] and [[Jim Hendricks (musician)|James Hendricks]] as part of [[The Big 3 (folk group)|the Big 3]]]]

After leaving high school to pursue an entertainment career in New York, Elliot toured in the musical ''[[The Music Man]]'' in 1962, but lost the part of Miss Marmelstein in ''[[I Can Get It for You Wholesale]]'' to [[Barbra Streisand]]. Elliot would sometimes sing while working as a cloakroom attendant at The Showplace in [[Greenwich Village]], but she did not pursue a singing career until she moved to the [[Washington, D.C.]] area to attend [[American University]] (not [[Swarthmore College]], as mentioned in the biographical song "[[Creeque Alley]]").

America's folk music scene was on the rise when Elliot met banjoist and singer [[Tim Rose]] and singer John Brown, and the three began performing as the Triumvirate. In 1963, [[James Hendricks]] replaced Brown, and the trio was renamed [[The Big 3 (folk group)|the Big 3]]. Elliot's first recording with the Big 3 was "[[Wynken, Blynken, and Nod|Winkin', Blinkin', and Nod]]", released by [[FM Records]] in 1963. In 1964, the group appeared on an "open mic" night at [[The Bitter End]] in Greenwich Village, billed as "Cass Elliot and the Big 3", followed onstage by folk singer Jim Fosso and [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] banjoist [[Eric Weissberg]] (who became famous eight years later for performing "[[Dueling Banjos]]" on the soundtrack for ''[[Deliverance]]'' (1972)).

Tim Rose left the Big 3 in 1964, and Elliot and Hendricks teamed with Canadians [[Zal Yanovsky]] and [[Denny Doherty]] to form [[The Mugwumps (band)|the Mugwumps]]. This group lasted eight months, after which Cass performed as a solo act for a while. In the meantime, Yanovsky and [[John Sebastian]] co-founded [[the Lovin' Spoonful]], while Doherty joined [[the New Journeymen]], a group that also included [[John Phillips (musician)|John Phillips]] and his wife [[Michelle Phillips|Michelle]]. In 1965, Doherty persuaded Phillips that Elliot should join the group, which she did while she and the group members were vacationing in the [[Virgin Islands]].

A popular legend about Elliot is that her [[vocal range]] was improved by three notes after she was hit on the head by some copper tubing while walking through a construction site behind the bar where the New Journeymen were playing in the Virgin Islands. Elliot confirmed the story in a 1968 interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, saying,

{{bq|1=It's true, I did get hit on the head by a pipe that fell down and my range was increased by three notes. They were tearing this club apart in the islands, revamping it, putting in a dance floor. Workmen dropped a thin metal plumbing pipe and it hit me on the head and knocked me to the ground. I had a [[concussion]] and went to the hospital. I had a bad headache for about two weeks and all of a sudden I was singing higher. It's true. Honest to God.&lt;ref&gt;''Rolling Stone'' magazine, No. 20 reprinted as {{cite journal |last=Hopkins |first=Jerry |date=October 26, 1968 |title=THE ROLLING STONE INTERVIEW: Cass Elliot |url=http://www.casselliot.com/rollingst.htm |journal=Rolling Stone |location=San Francisco |publisher=Straight Arrow Publishers, Inc. |accessdate=27 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140618122019/http://www.casselliot.com/rollingst.htm |archivedate=June 18, 2014 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, friends later said that the pipe story was a less embarrassing explanation for why John Phillips had kept her out of the group for so long, the real reason being that he considered her too fat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/music/artists/casspipe.asp|title=Mama Cass Hit on the Head with a Pipe : snopes.com|author=snopes|date=December 3, 2015|work=Snopes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Mamas &amp; the Papas==
With two female members, the New Journeymen needed a new name. According to Doherty, Elliot had the inspiration for the band's new name; as written on his website:

{{bq|1=We're all just lying around vegging out watching TV and discussing names for the group. The New Journeymen was not a handle that was going to hang on this outfit. John was pushing for the Magic Cyrcle. Eech, but none of us could come up with anything better, then we switch the channel and, hey, it's the [[Hells Angels]] on the [[The Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson|Carson show]]... And the first thing we hear is: "Now hold on there, Hoss. Some people call our women cheap, but we just call them our Mamas." Cass jumped up: "Yeah! I want to be a Mama." And Michelle is going: "We're the Mamas! We're the Mamas!" OK. I look at John. He's looking at me going: "The Papas?" Problem solved. A toast! To the Mamas and the Papas. Well, after many, many toasts, Cass and John are passed out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dennydoherty.com/dream/dream11.html|title=Dream A Little Dream : Just A-Catchin' Fire|website=Dennydoherty.com|accessdate=December 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Doherty also said that the occasion marked the beginning of his affair with Michelle Phillips. Elliot was in love with Doherty and was displeased when he told her of the affair. Doherty has said that Elliot once proposed to him, but that he was so stoned at the time that he could not even respond.

Elliot was known for her sense of humor and optimism, and was considered by some to be the most charismatic member of the group. Her powerful, distinctive voice was a major factor in their success. She is best remembered for her vocals on the group's hits "[[California Dreamin']]", "[[Monday, Monday]]", "[[Words of Love (The Mamas and the Papas song)|Words of Love]]", and the solo "[[Dream a Little Dream of Me]]", which the group recorded in 1968 after learning about the death of [[Fabian Andre]], one of the men who co-wrote it, whom Michelle Phillips had met years earlier. Elliot's version is noteworthy for its contemplative pace, whereas almost all earlier recordings of "Dream a Little Dream of Me" (including one by [[Nat King Cole]] and another by [[Ozzie Nelson]]) had been up-tempo versions&amp;mdash;the song having been written in 1931 as a dance tune.

The Mamas &amp; the Papas continued to record to meet the terms of their record contract. Their final album was released in 1971.

==Solo career==
[[File:Cass Elliot Johnny Cash 1969.JPG|thumb|right|Elliot with [[Johnny Cash]], 1969]]
After the breakup of the Mamas &amp; the Papas, Elliot embarked on a solo singing career. Her most successful recording during this period was 1968's "[[Dream a Little Dream of Me]]" from [[Dream a Little Dream (Cass Elliot album)|her solo album of the same name]], released by [[Dunhill Records]], though it had originally been released earlier that year on the album ''The Papas &amp; the Mamas Presented By The Mamas and the Papas''.

===London court case===
In 1967, while staying in London, Elliot was prosecuted for stealing bedlinen from an apartment where she had been staying on an earlier visit. She denied responsibility and the case was brought before the West London magistrates' court, where the charges against her were dismissed in the absence of any evidence. The band had been forced to cancel concerts as a result of the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1540140/Denny-Doherty.html|title=Denny Doherty|date=22 January 2007|website=The Telegraph|access-date=17 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a return visit to London, Elliot admitted to the audience at the [[London Palladium]] that she had taken two sheets, saying "I liked 'em so I took 'em".

In October 1968, Elliot made her live solo debut headlining in [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]] at [[Caesars Palace]], scheduled for a three-week engagement at [[United States dollar|$]]40,000 per week (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|40000|1968}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}), with two shows per night.&lt;ref name="Sink Along With Mama Cass"&gt;{{cite news | title=Sink Along With Mama Cass | url=http://www.casselliot.com/esquire.htm | publisher=Esquire | date=June 1969 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213064703/http://casselliot.com/esquire.htm | archivedate=December 13, 2010 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Elliot went on a six-month long [[crash diet]] before the show, losing 100 of her 300 pounds. According to Elliot, the weight loss led to a [[stomach ulcer]] and throat problems, which she treated by drinking milk and cream (and regaining 50 lbs. in the process).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mama Cass In Training for Night Club Re-Entry | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1356&amp;dat=19721215&amp;id=AGdRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=CwYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5061,3404963 | publisher=Ocala Star Banner | date=December 15, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A nervous Elliot was confined to her bed for three weeks before the first performance, as the musical director, band, and production supervisor attempted to put together a show in her absence. She was scheduled to rehearse for a full three days before the show opened, but she managed to get through only part of one run-through with the band before saying that she was losing her voice. She skipped the remainder of rehearsals and drank tea and lemon, hoping to recover and pull herself together for opening night.&lt;ref name="Fiegel"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fiegel|first=Eddi|title=Dream a Little Dream of Me: The Life of Cass Elliot|publisher=Chicago Review Press|date=September 28, 2005|pages=265–267|isbn=978-1-55652-588-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An audience of 950 people filled the Circus Maximus theatre at Caesar's Palace on the evening of Wednesday October 16, including [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]], [[Peter Lawford]], and [[Jimi Hendrix]]. [[Joan Baez]], [[Liza Minnelli]], and [[Mia Farrow]] had sent flowers to Elliot's dressing room. But backstage, a shivering Elliot had developed a raging fever. Friends urged her manager to cancel the show, but she felt it was too important and insisted on performing. Sick and having barely rehearsed, Elliot began to fall apart during the course of her first performance: her voice was weak and barely audible, and the large crowd was unsympathetic, despite the celebrity well-wishers. At the end of the show, Elliot returned to the stage to apologize to the audience, stating, "This is the first night, and it will get better". She then sang "Dream a Little Dream of Me" and left the stage as the audience applauded half-heartedly. She returned later that night to perform the second show, but her voice was worse, and many of the audience noisily walked out.&lt;ref name="Fiegel2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fiegel|first=Eddi|title=Dream a Little Dream of Me: The Life of Cass Elliot|publisher=Chicago Review Press|date=September 28, 2005|pages=267–8|isbn=978-1-55652-588-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviews were harsh. ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine called the show "a disaster" that was "heroic in proportion, epic in scope."&lt;ref name="Sink Along With Mama Cass"/&gt;  The ''[[Los Angeles Free Press]]'' called the show "an embarrassing drag." ''[[Newsweek]]'' compared the show to the [[Sinking of the RMS Titanic|''Titanic'' disaster]]: "Like some great ocean liner embarking on an ill-fated maiden voyage, Mama Cass slid down the ways and sank to the bottom." The show closed after only one night, and Elliot flew back to Los Angeles for what was described as "a [[tonsillectomy]]."&lt;ref name="Fiegel"/&gt;

===Substance abuse===
Within hours of the end of Elliot's Las Vegas concert, rumors began to spread that she had been taking drugs during the weeks leading up to it. Eddi Fiegel wrote in the biography ''Dream a Little Dream of Me'' that Elliot later admitted to a boyfriend that she had shot [[heroin]] immediately before going on stage. Embarrassed by the debacle, Elliot plunged into a deep depression.&lt;ref name="Fiegel"/&gt;

[[David Crosby]] published a memoir in 1988, saying the following about his use of heroin with Elliot:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It was always the bad drug, always the worst. It got a little more open around the time that Cass and I were doing it, but it wasn't something you told people [about]. It wasn't anything you bragged about, you know. ... Me and Cass Elliot were closet junk takers and used to get loaded with each other a lot.  We loved London because there was pharmaceutical heroin available in drugstores [there]. ... Government [of the United Kingdom] dope, in these injectable tablets that you crushed and dissolved in order to shoot them. Me and Cass used to just mash them up and snort the powder. ... Cass took lots of pills, usually from the opiate family: Dilaudid, Demerol, Percodan, downers of all sorts, and we did a lot of coke together.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|last=Crosby|first=David  |title=Long Time Gone|publisher=Doubleday|year=1988|pages=119–120}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Later work===
[[File:Cass Elliot 1973 television special.JPG|thumb|Photo from the special ''Don't Call Me Mama Anymore'']]
Elliot appeared in two television variety specials: ''The Mama Cass Television Show'' (ABC, 1969) and ''Don't Call Me Mama Anymore'' (CBS, 1973). She was a regular guest on TV talk shows and variety shows in the early 1970s, including ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]'', ''[[The Andy Williams Show]]'', ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'', ''[[The Johnny Cash Show (TV series)|The Johnny Cash Show]]'', ''[[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'', and ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'', and was a guest panelist for a week on the game show ''[[Match Game|Match Game '73]]''. She guest-hosted for [[Johnny Carson]] on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' and appeared as a guest on the show 13 other times. She also appeared on and co-hosted ''[[The Music Scene (TV series)|The Music Scene]]'' on ABC and was featured on the first ''[[The Midnight Special (TV series)|The Midnight Special]]'' on NBC.

She performed the title song "The Good Times Are Comin'" during the opening sequence of the 1970 film ''[[Monte Walsh (1970 film)|Monte Walsh]]'', starring [[Lee Marvin]] and [[Jack Palance]]. In 1972, she made three appearances on the variety series ''[[The Julie Andrews Hour]]''. Her final appearance on the show was the Christmas installment that aired on Wednesday, December 20, 1972. In December 1978, four years after Elliot's death, the episode was rebroadcast on syndicated stations as a Christmas special called ''Merry Christmas With Love, Julie''. However, all of Elliot's solos were deleted from the syndicated prints. In 2009, a complete videotape of ''The Julie Andrews Hour Christmas Show'' was donated to [[The Paley Center For Media]] in New York, with all of Elliot's numbers intact.

In 1973, Elliot performed in ''Saga of Sonora'', a TV music-comedy-western special with [[Jill St. John]], [[Vince Edwards]], [[Zero Mostel]], and [[Lesley Ann Warren]].

She also sang the jingle "Hurry on down to Hardee's, where the burgers are charco-broiled" for [[Hardee's]] advertisements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=April 23, 1997 |title=Hardee's looking at return to char-broiled burgers |url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/1997/04/23/biz_207185.shtml#.WMctReTatnw |newspaper=Augusta Chronicle |location= |publisher= |accessdate=March 13, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the early 1970s, Elliot continued her acting career, as well. She had a featured role in the movie ''[[Pufnstuf (film)|Pufnstuf]]'' (1970)  and made guest appearances on TV's ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]'', ''[[Young Dr. Kildare (TV series)|Young Dr. Kildare]]'', ''[[Love, American Style]]'', and ''[[The Red Skelton Show]]'', among others.

In 1973, Elliot hired as her manager [[Allan Carr]], who was also managing the careers of [[Tony Curtis]], [[Ann-Margret]], and [[Peter Sellers]]. Carr felt Elliot needed to leave pop and rock music altogether and head into the cabaret circuit, so a show was put together comprising old standards along with a few new songs written for her by friends. The act included Elliot and two male singers who served as backup singers and sidekicks during the musical numbers. The title of the show was ''Don't Call Me Mama Anymore'', named after one of the songs written by Elliot's friend Earle Brown. The song was born out of Elliot's frustration with being identified as "Mama Cass".

The show debuted in [[Pittsburgh]] on February 9, 1973. Elliot felt ready to tackle Las Vegas once again and premiered at the [[Flamingo Las Vegas|Flamingo]]. This time, she received rave reviews. ''The Las Vegas Sun'' wrote, "Cass Elliot, making a strong point that she is no longer Mama Cass, has a good act serving notice that she is here to stay. The audience was with her all the way... no empty seats anywhere." She then took her act to higher-echelon casinos and swankier nightclubs in cities throughout the country.

==Personal life==
Elliot was married twice, the first time in 1963 to James Hendricks, her group mate in the Big 3 and the Mugwumps. This was reportedly a platonic arrangement to assist him in avoiding being drafted during the [[Vietnam War]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hotshotdigital.com/tribute/MamaCass.html|title=Mama Cass|website=Hotshotdigital.com|accessdate=December 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the marriage reportedly was never [[consummation|consummated]] and was annulled in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laurelcanyonthebook.com/?cat=50 Meet the Mugwumps] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080221080850/http://www.laurelcanyonthebook.com/?cat=50 |date=February 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, Elliot married journalist Donald von Wiedenman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,903034,00.html|title=Milestones, Jul. 12, 1971|date=July 12, 1971|work=TIME.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a photo, see [http://www.casselliot.com/imagepage2.htm the Official Cass Elliot Website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209230303/http://www.casselliot.com/imagepage2.htm |date=December 9, 2006 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; heir to a [[Bavaria]]n barony. Their marriage ended in divorce after a few months.

Elliot gave birth to daughter Owen Vanessa Elliot on April 26, 1967. She never publicly identified the father, but many years later, [[Michelle Phillips]] helped Owen locate her biological father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=California Dreamgirl | url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2007/12/phillips200712 | publisher=Vanity Fair | date=December 2007|accessdate=November 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Chuck Day]] died in 2008, it was revealed that he was Owen's father.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marinij.com/article/zz/20080312/NEWS/803129986&lt;/ref&gt; After Elliot's death, her younger sister, [[Leah Kunkel]] (then married to Los Angeles-based session drummer [[Russ Kunkel]]), received custody of Owen, then seven years old, and raised her along with her own son, Nathaniel. Owen grew up to become a singer as well and toured with [[The Beach Boys|Beach Boys]] member [[Al Jardine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.superseventies.com/faq_beachboys.html|title=Beach Boys FAQ|website=Superseventies.com|accessdate=December 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
[[File:Cass Elliot Grave.JPG|thumb|150px|left|Grave of Cass Elliot at Mount Sinai Memorial Park]]
[[File:MoonflatCurzonPlace.JPG|alt=Curzon Square, Mayfair, London|thumb|right|9 Curzon Square in 2012; Flat 12 was on the fourth floor (top left) in 1974.]]
On April 22, 1974, Elliot collapsed in the Burbank, California television studio of ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' immediately before her scheduled appearance on the show.  She was treated at a hospital and released, then dismissed the incident in interviews, including one on the American television talk show ''The Mike Douglas Show'', as simple exhaustion.  Her appearance on that episode of ''The Mike Douglas Show'' turned out to be her last for television.

In July 1974, Elliot performed two weeks of concerts as a solo performer at the [[London Palladium]]. Many claimed that all of these shows were sold out, but she was often playing to a less-than-full house after the earliest dates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fiegel|first1=Eddi|title=Dream a Little Dream|publisher=Chicago Review Press|page=356}}&lt;/ref&gt; She made an [[international call]] to Michelle Phillips after the final concert on July 28. Phillips said later that Elliot sounded elated that she had received standing ovations each night.

She may have retired for the evening immediately after this telephone conversation, but [[Debbie Reynolds]] claimed in her 2013 book ''Unsinkable: A Memoir'' that she and her children, [[Carrie Fisher]] and [[Todd Fisher]], saw Elliot at a party that night at the London home of [[Mick Jagger]].&lt;ref name="Reynolds, Debbie with Dorian Hannaway 2013"&gt;{{cite book | author=Reynolds, Debbie (with Dorian Hannaway) | title=Unsinkable: A Memoir | publisher=[[William Morrow and Company]] | year=2013 | isbn=978-0-062-21365-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reynolds noticed that when Elliot left the party saying she was headed to where she was staying, she was not accompanied by anyone.&lt;ref name="Reynolds, Debbie with Dorian Hannaway 2013"/&gt;

That night, Elliot, age 32, died in her sleep at the London flat where she was staying. According to forensic pathologist [[Keith_Simpson_(pathologist)|Keith Simpson]], who conducted her [[autopsy]], her death was due to heart failure. A drug screen that was part of the forensic autopsy revealed there were no drugs in her system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Elliot-Kugell|first1=Owen|title=Biography|url=http://casselliot.com/biography.htm|website=The Official Cass Elliot Website|publisher=Richard Barton Campbell &amp; Owen Elliot-Kugell|accessdate=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-report"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F10613FD3F5B1A7493C2AA178CD85F408785F9 | title=Cass Elliot, Pop Singer, Dies; Star of the Mamas and Papas | format=paid archive | publisher=The New York Times | date=July 30, 1974 | accessdate=June 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-heart"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F70E11F93E5E1A7493C4A91783D85F408785F9 |title=Cass Elliot's Death Linked to Heart Attack|publisher=The New York Times|format=paid archive|date=August 6, 1974|accessdate=June 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elliot died in Flat 12, 9 [[Curzon Place]] (later Curzon Square), [[Shepherd Market]], [[Mayfair]], London, which was on loan from singer-songwriter [[Harry Nilsson]].

An oft-repeated [[urban legend]] is that Elliot choked to death on a ham sandwich.&lt;ref name=snopes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/music/artists/mamacass.htm|title=Mama Cass Death Rumors|date=January 11, 2010|website=Snopes.com|accessdate=December 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Leopold |first=Todd |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2009-09-23/entertainment/john.mackenzie.phillips_1_john-phillips-papas-mamas/2?_s=PM:SHOWBIZ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130119235808/http://articles.cnn.com/2009-09-23/entertainment/john.mackenzie.phillips_1_john-phillips-papas-mamas/2?_s=PM:SHOWBIZ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 19, 2013 |title=John Phillips had checkered, sometimes sordid, life |publisher=CNN |date=September 23, 2009 |accessdate=December 30, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The story spread soon after the discovery of her body and was based on speculation in the initial media coverage. A 2014 article in ''[[Haaretz]]'' identified the person who started the false rumor as follows: "Unfortunately, the first doctor [in London] who examined her speculated to the press about the cause of death, and that’s the version that stuck."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/.premium-1.607677|title=This Day in Jewish History / Singer Cass Elliot Dies|first=David B.|last=Green|date=July 29, 2014|website=Haaretz.com|accessdate=December 19, 2017|via=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt; An autopsy had not been performed when the physician was quoted, and London police told reporters that a partially eaten sandwich found in her room might have been relevant to the cause of death. The post-mortem found that Elliot had died of heart failure, and no food was present in her [[Vertebrate trachea|windpipe]], yet the false story has persisted ever since.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-heart" /&gt;

==Tributes and other popular culture references==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5525">'''Causal layered analysis''' ('''CLA''') is a [[futures techniques|technique]] used in [[strategic planning]] and [[futures studies]] to more effectively shape the future.&lt;ref name=futurist&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.wfs.org/futurist/january-february-2014-vol-48-no-1/causal-layered-analysis-defined|title = Causal Layered Analysis Defined|last = Inayatullah|first = Sohail|journal = The Futurist|publisher = [[World Future Society]]|date = January–February 2014|volume = 48|issue = 1|accessdate = July 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scenariosforsustainability.org/recipes/cla.html|title = Causal Layered Analysis|publisher = Scenarios for Sustainability Recipes|accessdate = July 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique was pioneered by [[Sohail Inayatullah]], a [[Pakistani-Australian]] [[futures studies]] researcher.&lt;ref name=cla-first&gt;{{cite journal|title = Causal layered analysis: Poststructuralism as method|doi = 10.1016/S0016-3287(98)00086-X|journal = [[Futures (journal)|Futures]]|volume = 30|issue = 8|date = October 1998|accessdate = July 2, 2014|last = Inayatullah|first = Sohail|pages = 815–829|url = http://proutglobal.info/slideshows/training/Related%20web%20pages/002-Casual_Layered_Analysis.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==

Causal layered analysis works by identifying many different levels, and attempting to make synchronized changes at all levels to create a coherent new future. Inayatullah's original paper&lt;ref name=cla-first/&gt; as well as his [[TEDx]] talk&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImWDmFPfifI|title = Causal Layered Analysis: Sohail Inayatullah at TEDxNoosa|last = Inayatullah|first = Sohail|date = May 12, 2013|accessdate = July 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; identify four levels:

# The '''litany''': This includes quantitative trends, often exaggerated and used for political purposes. The result could be a feeling of apathy, helplessness, or projected action. Inayatullah calls this "the conventional level of futures research which can readily create a politics of fear."&lt;ref name=cla-first/&gt;
# Social '''causes''', including economic, cultural, political, and historical factors.
# '''Structure''' and the '''discourse''' that legitimizes and supports the structure.
# '''Metaphor''' and '''myth'''

==History of research==

CLA was first introduced explicitly as a futures research technique by Sohail Inayatullah in a 1998 article for ''[[Futures (journal)|Futures]]'' that would come to be widely cited.&lt;ref name=cla-first/&gt; Later, Inayatullah would edit the CLA Reader, that featured chapters from a number of futurists and practitioners describing their experience with CLA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metafuture.org/Books/causal_layered_analysis_reader.htm|title = The Causal Layered Analysis Reader|publisher = Metafuture.org|accessdate = July 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metafuture.org/cla%20papers/Inayatullah%20%20Causal%20layered%20analysis%20-%20theory,%20historical%20context,%20and%20case%20studies.%20Intro%20chapter%20from%20The%20CLA%20Reader..pdf|title = The Causal Layered Analysis (CLA) Reader: Theory and Case Studies of an Integrative and Transformative Methodology|accessdate = July 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inayatullah's work on CLA was examined in a book by Jose W. Ramos in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://researchbank.swinburne.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/swin:8255|title = From critique to cultural recovery: critical futures studies and casual layered analysis|last = Ramos|first = Jose W.|date = 2003|publisher = [[Australian Foresight Institute]]|accessdate = July 2, 2014|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140714133155/http://researchbank.swinburne.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/swin:8255#|archive-date = 2014-07-14|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 article by Chris Riedy examined the similarities, differences, and possible combinations of CLA and [[Ken Wilber]]'s integral theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = An Integral extension of causal layered analysis|url=http://epress.lib.uts.edu.au/research/bitstream/handle/10453/9782/2007001241.pdf?sequence=1|last = Riedy|first = Chris|volume = 40|issue = 2|date = March 2008|pages = 150–159|journal = [[Futures (journal)|Futures]]|publisher = [[Elsevier]]|doi = 10.1016/j.futures.2007.11.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 article by Gary P. Hampson explored the relationship between integral futures and CLA further, and also considered [[Richard Slaughter]]'s critique of CLA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metafuture.org/pdf/epistemologicalfutures.pdf#page=53|title = Futures of integral futures: An analysis of Richard Slaughter's analysis of Causal Layered Analysis|journal = [[Futures (journal)|Futures]]|last = Hampson|first = Gary P.|volume = 42|issue = 2|date = March 2010|accessdate = July 2, 2014|doi = 10.1016/j.futures.2009.09.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sohail Inayatullah and Ivana Milojevic have published an update in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.usc.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/usc:14860|title=CLA 2.0 Transformative Research in Theory and Practice|date = 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; With various authors, they investigate topics such as:
* The Global Financial Crisis
* Terrorism futures
* Global governance
* Ageing and the changing workforce
* Educational and university futures
* Climate change
* Water futures in the Muslim world
* The alternative futures of China
* Agricultural policy in Australia
* The new national narrative in Singapore

Many [[definitions of terrorism]] exist, but there is no consensus on a single, universal definition. For example, Kydd and Walter define terrorism as "the use of violence against civilians by non-state actors to attain political goals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kydd|first1=Andrew H.|last2=Walter|first2=Barbara F.|title=The Strategies of Terrorism|journal=The MIT Press|date=Summer 2006|volume=31|issue=1|pages=49–80|jstor=4137539|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US Department of State defines terrorism as "premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents." On the other hand, the FBI's Code of Federal Regulations defines terrorism as "The unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=U.S. Department of Justice|title=Terrorism 2002/2005|url=https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/terrorism-2002-2005|website=FBI}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of a universal definition of terrorism has led to controversies, making it sometimes difficult to label a certain attack as a terrorist incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harris|first1=Mike|title=The legal definition of terrorism threatens to criminalise us all|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/the-legal-definition-of-terrorism-threatens-to-criminalise-us-all-9626325.html|accessdate=May 16, 2017|publisher=Independent|date=July 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Tarik Kafala, head of BBC Arabic insists journalists must stop using the term "terrorist", because it is a "value-laden" term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sherwin|first1=Adam|title=BBC Arabic head Tarik Kafala on the channel's increasing significance in the modern world|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/opinion/bbc-arabic-head-tarik-kafala-on-the-channels-increasing-significance-in-the-modern-world-10001667.html|publisher=The Independent|date=January 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, there have been controversies, such as Obama's refusal to use the phrase, "Islamic terrorism", with political implications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Diaz|first1=Daniella|title=Obama: Why I won't say 'Islamic terrorism'|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/09/28/politics/obama-radical-islamic-terrorism-cnn-town-hall/|publisher=CNN|date=September 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vagueness of Definition==
There are several problems with the [[definition of terrorism]].

''No universally accepted definition''

There is no universally accepted definition of terrorism. In his paper, "Defining Terrorism: Is One Man's Terrorist Another Man's Freedom Fighter?", Boaz Ganor points out the urgency of an internationally accepted definition of terrorism due to the ambiguousness of the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ganor|first1=Boaz|title=Defining Terrorism: Is One Man's Terrorist another Man's Freedom Fighter?|journal=Police Practice and Research|date=2002|volume=3|issue=4|pages=287–304|doi=10.1080/1561426022000032060|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1561426022000032060|accessdate=May 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even within the country of the United States, the US Department of State and the FBI have different definitions of terrorism, which can lead one institute to classify an event as terrorist while another does not.

''Vague wording''

Another issue with the definition of terrorism is its vague wording. Navin Bapat, a professor of political science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and expert on terrorist campaigns, points out the subjective nature of words used in definitions of terrorism, such as "non-combatant" and "political purposes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Peralta|first1=Eyder|title=When Is An Act Of Violence An Act Of Terrorism?|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/07/17/423881551/when-is-an-act-of-violence-an-act-of-terrorism|publisher=NPR|date=July 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subjectivity of such words allows for dispute over whether a group is or is not terrorist, as questions such as the degree to which the attack was pre-meditated, the degree to which a subnational group was involved with the premeditation of the attack, or the definition of a "non-combatant" and what ideologies are considered "political" may arise.

''Examples''

[[Steve Biko]] was a South African [[Internal resistance to South African apartheid|anti-apartheid]] activist who believed that some violence against whites was inevitable while apartheid remained in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woods|first1=Donald|title=Biko|date=1978|publisher=NewYork and London: Paddington Press|isbn=0-8050-1899-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a leading figure of the [[South African Students' Organization]], and participated in founding the [[Black People's Convention]]. According to many definitions of terrorism, including the US Department of State and Kydd &amp; Walter as well as the [[Terrorism Act, 1967|Terrorism Act]] of South Africa at the time, Steve Biko's activities qualified as terrorism. Steve Biko was arrested under the South African Terrorism Act, and died while in custody. Today, Steve Biko is appraised as a hero - &lt;ref&gt;Ahluwalia and Zegeye described him as "an articulate and visionary black South African intellectual and hero"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ahluwalia|first1=Pal|last2=Zegeye|first2=Abebe|title=Frantz Fanon and Steve Biko: Towards Liberation|journal=Social Identities|date=2001|volume=7|issue=3|pages=455–469|doi=10.1080/1350463012008726}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manning Marable and Peniel Joseph also referred to him as "one of South Africa's greatest fighters - and martyrs - for freedom." In a public vote in 2004, Steve Biko was elected 13th of [[SABC3's Great South Africans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marable|first1=Manning|last2=Joseph|first2=Peniel|title=Series Editors' Preface: Steve Biko and the International Context of Black Consciousness|date=2008|publisher=New York and Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-60519-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This example illustrates the fact that some "terrorists" may become heroes when alternate perspectives are acknowledged.

Similarly, the [[Edelweiss Pirates]] were a group of youth that stood up against the [[Nazi regime]], sometimes using violence. Some of the members were arrested and executed for conspiring to plant a bomb at the [[Gestapo]] headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Macey|first1=Jennifer|title=Campaigning for Cologne's Maligned Resistance|url=http://www.dw.com/en/campaigning-for-colognes-maligned-resistance/a-1391096|website=DW|publisher=Deutsche Welle}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the definition of terrorism as outlined by the US Department of State, this group can be categorized as terrorist, as they are a subnational group that planned politically-motivated violence against noncombatant targets. In 2005, however, the German authorities gave official recognition to the [[Edelweiss Pirates]] as resistance heroes after 60 years of denouncing them as a criminal organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Teenage rebels who fought Nazis are honoured at last|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/1492771/Teenage-rebels-who-fought-Nazis-are-honoured-at-last.html|publisher=The Telegraph|date=June 25, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that German authorities may recognize as heroes a group that not only was once considered a criminal group but can also presently qualify as a terrorist group, clearly demonstrates the vagueness of the various definitions of terrorism currently used by different institutions around the world.

A more recent and more controversial example is the [[2016 Orlando Nightclub Shooting]]. Though it has been established that the shooter, Omar Mateen, pledged allegiance to ISIS,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ellis|first1=Ralph|title=Orlando shooting: 49 killed, shooter pledged ISIS allegiance|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/06/12/us/orlando-nightclub-shooting/|publisher=CNN|date=June 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is no evidence that ISIS provided operational support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Malsin|first1=Jared|title=What to Know About ISIS's Role in the Orlando Shooting|url=http://time.com/4365507/orlando-shooting-isis-claims-responsibility-terror/|publisher=TIME|date=June 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; If this incident is to be labeled "terrorist" according to the definition of terrorism as defined by the US Department of State, Mateen must be acting as an agent of ISIS. However, ISIS lack of direct involvement in the premeditation and execution of the attack provides complications.

==Islam and Terrorism==
{{See also|Islamic Terrorism}}

Much controversy exists over the association of Islam with terrorism. Since the [[September 11 Attacks]], any act of violence has been prone to being labeled as "terrorist" if the perpetrator is Muslim, regardless of the intentions and organization details of the attack, rendering the definitions of terrorism void. For example, the [[2017 Westminster Attack]] has been described as a terrorist attack by various media agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Allen|first1=Emily|last2=Henderson|first2=Barney|title=Westminster Attack - Everything We Know So Far About the Events in london|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/03/22/westminster-terror-attack-everything-know-far/|publisher=The Telegraph|date=March 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith-Spark|first1=Laura|title=Westminster Attack: What You Need to Know|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/03/22/europe/uk-parliament-incident-what-happened/|publisher=CNN|date=March 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as with the [[2016 Orlando Nightclub Shooting]], no evidence linking the Khalid Massood, the attacker, to terrorist organizations has been found. Similarly, the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting]] sparked controversy when Tarik Kafala, head of [[BBC Arabic]], claimed that the attack must not be labeled as one of terrorist nature by the media because the term "terrorist" is value-laden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Turner|first1=Camilla|title=We must not call Charlie Hebdo killers 'terrorists', says BBC boss|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/bbc/11369104/We-must-not-call-Charlie-Hebdo-killers-terrorists-says-BBC-boss.html|publisher=The Telegraph|date=January 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, Muslims have been subject to particular scrutiny. In their paper, "‘I’m a Muslim, but I'm not a Terrorist’: Victimization, Risky Identities and the Performance of Safety", Mythen, Walkate &amp; Khan highlight the risk, identity, and experience of victimization that British Muslims encounter due to the current discourse on terrorism, which is biased towards Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mythen|first1=Gabe|last2=Walkate|first2=Sandra|last3=Khan|first3=Fatima|title=‘I’m a Muslim, but I'm not a Terrorist’: Victimization, Risky Identities and the Performance of Safety|journal=The British Journal of Criminology|date=2009|volume=49|issue=6|pages=736–754|doi=10.1093/bjc/azp032|url=https://academic.oup.com/bjc/article/49/6/736/408706/I-m-a-Muslim-but-I-m-not-a-Terrorist-Victimization|accessdate=May 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kosic and Nordio point out how the discourse on terrorism has created a tension between self and the "Other" in Europe, creating difficulties in communities' acceptance of immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kosic|first1=Marianna|last2=Nordio|first2=Daria|title=Perception and construction of "otherness" biased by fear|journal=IUIES-International University Institute for European Studies University of Trieste|date=2007|url=http://www.eisa-net.org/be-bruga/eisa/files/events/turin/Kosic-kosic_nordio_2007_perception_and_construction_of_otherness_biased_by_fear.pdf|accessdate=May 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such isolation of the Muslim community has led to scandalous incidents, particularly in airports and aircraft. For example, in August, 2016, three siblings were removed from an EasyJet flight from Stansted to Naples after being falsely accused of reading [[ISIS]] materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grierson|first1=Jamie|title=Trio forced off easyJet plane over false claims they support Isis|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/24/dharas-siblings-forced-off-easyjet-plane-stansted-accused-supporting-isis?CMP=share_btn_tw|accessdate=May 12, 2017|publisher=The Guardian|date=August 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslim communities have also experienced hate crimes, such as when an arsonist set fire at the Islamic Center of Fort Pierce.

==Political Implications==
Governments can use the label and definitions of terrorism to convince the public that measures are being taken to protect them. For example, terrorism can be addressed as either a military problem or a criminal problem. [[President George W. Bush]] categorized terrorists as militants by declaring a [[war on terrorism]], while [[President Barack Obama]] used counter-terrorist measures rather than military measures. Governments can also use the label to isolate groups. Isolated groups may be oppressed, discriminated against, and delegitimized.

The isolation of groups by labeling them as terrorist has led to a division between the in-group and out-group, causing mistrust and caution towards immigration. This phenomenon is leading to the rise of extreme-right leaning candidates in Europe, particularly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.csis.org/analysis/europe-crosshairs-political-implications-terror|title=Europe in the Crosshairs: Political Implications of Terror|website=CSIS|publisher=Center for Strategic and International Studies|last1=Nilsson|first1=Carl Hvenmark|accessdate=May 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, [[President Donald J. Trump]] has called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States and a registry of the US Muslim population, citing terrorism as justification. Reports from the Southern Poverty Law Center claim that Trump’s campaign contributed to the tripling of hate groups against Muslims from 34 in 2015 to 101 in 2016. The FBI found that hate crimes against Muslims increased by 67% in 2015. The SPLC documented over 300 bias-related incidents targeting immigrants or Muslims in the first 10 days after Trump’s election. 80% out of 10,000 educators reported more intense anxiety and fear among immigrant students and Muslim students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=England|first1=Charlotte|title=Donald Trump blamed for massive spike in Islamophobic hate crime|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-blame-islamophobic-anti-muslim-ban-hate-crime-numbers-southern-poverty-law-center-a7582846.html|accessdate=May 12, 2017|publisher=The Independent|date=February 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is Israel's political actions. Israel labels [[Palestinian political violence]] against them as terrorist, which allows Israel to reject negotiation. On the other hand, when Israel executed [[Operation Wooden Leg]] on Tunisia, leaving 47 dead and 65 wounded,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/03/world/tunisia-s-leader-bitter-at-the-us.html|title=TUNISIA'S LEADER BITTER AT THE U.S.|last=Times|first=Frank J.

'''Critical thinking''' is the [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] analysis of [[fact]]s to form a judgment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.criticalthinking.org/pages/defining-critical-thinking/766|title=Defining Critical Thinking|publisher=The International Center for the Assessment of Higher Order Thinking (ICAT, US)/Critical Thinking Community|accessdate=2017-03-22|author=Edward M.

It entails effective communication and problem-solving abilities, as well as a commitment to overcome our native [[egocentrism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.telacommunications.com/nutshell/stages.htm|title=Piaget's Stages of Cognitive Development|website=www.telacommunications.com|language=en-us|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/fulfillment-any-age/201204/it-s-fine-line-between-narcissism-and-egocentrism|title=It’s a Fine Line Between Narcissism and Egocentrism|website=Psychology Today|language=en|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sociocentrism|sociocentrism.]]

==History==
The earliest documentation of critical thinking are the teachings of [[Socrates]] recorded by Plato. Socrates established the fact that one cannot depend upon those in "authority" to have sound knowledge and insight. He demonstrated that persons may have power and high position and yet be deeply confused and irrational. He established the importance of asking deep questions that probe profoundly into thinking before we accept ideas as worthy of belief.

He established the importance of seeking evidence, closely examining reasoning and assumptions, analyzing basic concepts, and tracing out implications not only of what is said but of what is done as well. His method of questioning is now known as "Socratic Questioning" and is the best known critical thinking teaching strategy. In his mode of questioning, Socrates highlighted the need for thinking for clarity and logical consistency. Socrates asked people questions to reveal their irrational thinking or lack of reliable knowledge. Socrates demonstrated that having authority does not ensure accurate knowledge. He established the method of questioning beliefs, closely inspecting assumptions and relying on evidence and sound rationale. Plato recorded Socrates' teachings and carried on the tradition of critical thinking. Aristotle and subsequent Greek skeptics refined Socrates' teachings, using systematic thinking and asking questions to ascertain the true nature of reality beyond the way things appear from a glance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.criticalthinking.org/pages/a-brief-history-of-the-idea-of-critical-thinking/408|title=A Brief History of the Idea of Critical Thinking|website=www.criticalthinking.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Socrates set the agenda for the tradition of critical thinking, namely, to reflectively question common beliefs and explanations, carefully distinguishing beliefs that are reasonable and logical from those that—however appealing to our native egocentrism, however much they serve our vested interests, however comfortable or comforting they may be—lack adequate evidence or rational foundation to warrant belief.

Critical thinking was described by Richard W. Paul as a movement in two waves (1994).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Re-Thinking Reason|last=Walters|first=Kerry|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=1994|isbn=|location=Albany|pages=181–98|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "first wave" of critical thinking is often referred to as 
a 'critical analysis' that is clear, [[rationality|rational]] thinking involving [[critique]]. Its details vary amongst those who [[operational definition|define]] it. According to Barry K. Beyer (1995), critical thinking means making clear, reasoned judgments. During the process of critical thinking, ideas should be reasoned, well thought out, and judged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://myweb.wvnet.edu/~jelkins/critproj/overview.html|title = The Critical Thinking Movement: Alternating Currents in One Teacher's Thinking|first=James R. | last=Elkins|accessdate = 23 March 2014 |website =myweb.wvnet.edu |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. National Council for Excellence in Critical Thinking&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criticalthinking.org//|title=Critical Thinking Index Page|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines critical thinking as the "&lt;nowiki&gt;intellectually disciplined process of actively and skillfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing, synthesizing, or evaluating information gathered from, or generated by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or communication, as a guide to belief and action.&lt;/nowiki&gt;"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.criticalthinking.org/pages/defining-critical-thinking/766|title=Defining Critical Thinking|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Critical Thinking Skills Diagram.jpg|thumb|
Critical Thinking Skills Diagram
]]
In the term '''critical thinking''', the word ''[[wikt:critical|critical]]'', (Grk. κριτικός = ''kritikos'' = "critic") derives from the word '''critic''' and implies a [[critique]]; it identifies the intellectual capacity and the means "of judging", "of judgement", "for judging", and of being "able to discern".&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Lesley. (ed.) ''The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary'' (1993) p. 551.&lt;/ref&gt; The intellectual roots of critical&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dictionary.com/e/critical-thinking/|title=Lexical Investigations: Critical Thinking - Everything After Z by Dictionary.com|date=2013-06-25|work=Everything After Z by Dictionary.com|access-date=2018-04-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; thinking are as [[Ancient history|''ancient'']] as its etymology, traceable, ultimately, to the [[Teachings and philosophy of Swami Vivekananda|teaching]] practice and vision of '''''[[Socrates]]'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/socrates-9488126|title=Socrates|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2,500 years ago who discovered by a method of probing questioning that people could not rationally justify their confident claims to [[Knowledge|knowledge.]]

==Definitions==
Traditionally, critical thinking has been variously defined as follows:

* Thinking about one's thinking in a manner designed to organize and clarify, raise the efficiency of, and recognize errors and biases in one's own thinking. Critical thinking is not 'hard' thinking nor is it directed at solving problems (other than 'improving' one's own thinking). Critical thinking is inward-directed with the intent of maximizing the [[rationality]] of the thinker. One does not use critical thinking to solve problems—one uses critical thinking to improve one's process of thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Carmichael, Kirby; letter to Olivetti, Laguna Salada Union School District, May 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "An appraisal based on careful analytical evaluation"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/critical+analysis|title=critical analysis|newspaper=TheFreeDictionary.com|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary critical thinking scholars have expanded these traditional definitions to include qualities, concepts, and processes such as creativity, imagination, discovery, reflection, empathy, connecting knowing, feminist theory, subjectivity, ambiguity, and inconclusiveness.  Some definitions of critical thinking exclude these subjective practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Re-Thinking Reason|last=Walters|first=Kerry|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=1994|isbn=|location=Albany|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logic and rationality==
{{main article|Logic and rationality}}
{{refimprove section|date=November 2016|reason=need to follow standard wikipedia reference style}}
The ability to reason logically is a fundamental skill of rational agents, hence the study of the form of correct argumentation is relevant to the study of critical thinking.

"First wave" logical [[thinking]] consisted of understanding the connections between two concepts or points in thought. It followed a philosophy where the [[Thought|thinker]] was removed from the train of thought and the connections and the analysis of the connect was devoid of any bias of the thinker. Kerry Walters describes this ideology in his essay Beyond Logicism in Critical Thinking, "A logistic approach to critical thinking conveys the message to students that thinking is legitimate only when it conforms to the procedures of informal (and, to a lesser extent, formal) logic and that the good thinker necessarily aims for styles of examination and appraisal that are analytical, abstract, universal, and objective. This model of [[thinking]] has become so entrenched in conventional academic wisdom that many educators accept it as canon".&lt;ref name="Walters1994"/&gt; The adoption of these principals parallels themselves with the increasing reliance on a quantitative understanding of the world.

In the ‘second wave’ of critical thinking, as defined by [[Kerry S. Walters]] (Re-thinking Reason, 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;1), many authors moved away from the logocentric mode of critical thinking that the ‘first wave’ privileged, especially in institutions of higher [[learning]]. Walters summarizes logicism as "the unwarranted assumption that good thinking is reducible to logical thinking".&lt;ref name="Walters1994"/&gt;

"A logistic approach to critical thinking conveys the message to students that thinking is legitimate only when it conforms to the procedures of informal (and, to a lesser extent, formal) logic and that the good thinker necessarily aims for styles of examination and appraisal that are analytical, abstract, universal, and objective."&lt;ref name="Walters1994"/&gt;
As the ‘second wave’ took hold, scholars began to take a more inclusive view of what constituted as critical thinking. Rationality and logic are still widely accepted in many circles as the primary examples of critical thinking.

===Deduction, abduction and induction===
{{main|logical reasoning}}
There are three types of [[logical reasoning]] Informally, two kinds of logical reasoning can be distinguished in addition to formal [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]]: [[inductive reasoning|induction]] and [[abductive reasoning|abduction]].
* [[Deductive reasoning|Deduction]] is the conclusion of a consequence given premises that logically follow by [[modus ponens]].
  e.g., X is human and all humans have a face so X has a face.
* [[Inductive reasoning|Induction]] is drawing a conclusion from a pattern that is guaranteed by the strictness of the structure to which it applies.
  e.g., The sum of even integers is even.
  2x+2y = 2(x+y); The sum of integers is an integer and x and y are integers, so 2x+2y=2z where z is an integer, thus 2z is an even integer, so the sum of even integers is even.
* [[Abductive reasoning|Abduction]] is drawing a conclusion using a [[heuristic]] that is likely, but not inevitable given some foreknowledge.
  e.g., I observe sheep in a field, and they appear white from my viewing angle, so sheep are white.
       Contrast with the deductive statement:"Some sheep are white on at least one side."
&lt;!--Start copypasta--&gt;

===Critical thinking and rationality===
Kerry S. Walters (Re-thinking Reason, 1994) argues that rationality demands more than just logical or traditional methods of problem solving and analysis or what he calls the "calculus of justification" but also considers "[[cognitive]] acts such as [[imagination]], conceptual creativity, [[intuition]] and insight" (p.&amp;nbsp;63). These "functions" are focused on discovery, on more abstract processes instead of linear, rules-based approaches to problem-solving. The linear and non-sequential mind must both be engaged in the [[rational]] [[mind]].&lt;ref name="Walters1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kerry S. Walters|title=Re-Thinking Reason: New Perspectives in Critical Thinking|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TfT32n2Hvd0C|year=1994|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-2095-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability to critically analyze an argument – to dissect structure and components, thesis and reasons – is essential. But so is the ability to be flexible and consider non-traditional alternatives and perspectives. These complementary functions are what allow for critical thinking to be a practice encompassing imagination and intuition in cooperation with traditional modes of deductive inquiry.&lt;ref name="Walters1994"/&gt;

==Functions==
The list of core critical thinking skills includes observation, interpretation, analysis, inference, evaluation, explanation, and [[metacognition]]. According to Reynolds (2011), an individual or group engaged in a strong way of critical thinking gives due consideration to establish for instance:&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Martin (2011). Critical thinking and systems thinking: towards a critical literacy for systems thinking in practice. In: Horvath, Christopher P. and Forte, James M. eds. Critical Thinking. New York: Nova Science Publishers, pp. 37–68.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Evidence through reality
* Context skills to isolate the problem from context
* Relevant criteria for making the judgment well
* Applicable methods or techniques for forming the judgment
* Applicable theoretical constructs for understanding the problem and the question at hand

In addition to possessing strong critical-thinking skills, one must be disposed to engage problems and decisions using those skills. Critical thinking employs not only [[logic]] but broad [[intellect]]ual criteria such as clarity, [[credibility]], [[accuracy]], precision, [[relevance]], depth, [[breadth]], significance, and fairness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first= Elizabeth A., &amp; And Others |year=1995|title= National Assessment of College Student Learning: Identifying College Graduates' Essential Skills in Writing, Speech and Listening, and Critical Thinking.

==Procedure==
Critical thinking calls for the ability to:
* Recognize problems, to find workable means for meeting those problems
* Understand the importance of prioritization and order of precedence in problem solving
* Gather and marshal pertinent (relevant) information
* Recognize [[unstated assumption]]s and values
* Comprehend and use [[language]] with accuracy, clarity, and [[wikt:discernment|discernment]]
* Interpret data, to appraise evidence and evaluate arguments
* Recognize the existence (or non-existence) of logical relationships between propositions
* Draw warranted conclusions and generalizations
* Put to test the conclusions and generalizations at which one arrives
* Reconstruct one's patterns of beliefs on the basis of wider experience
* Render accurate judgments about specific things and qualities in everyday life

In sum:

"A persistent effort to examine any belief or supposed form of knowledge in the light of the evidence that supports or refutes it and the further conclusions to which it tends."&lt;ref name=glaser&gt;{{Cite book| title=An Experiment in the Development of Critical Thinking| edition=| author=Edward M. Glaser| year=1941| publisher=New York, Bureau of Publications, Teachers College, Columbia University| isbn=0-404-55843-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habits or traits of mind==
The habits of [[mind]] that characterize a person strongly disposed toward critical thinking include a desire to follow reason and evidence wherever they may lead, a systematic approach to problem solving, [[inquisitiveness]], even-handedness, and confidence in [[reasoning]].&lt;ref&gt;The National Assessment of College Student Learning: Identification of the Skills to be Taught, Learned, and Assessed, NCES 94–286, US Dept of Education, Addison Greenwood (Ed), Sal Carrallo (PI). See also, Critical thinking: A statement of expert consensus for purposes of educational assessment and instruction. ERIC Document No. ED 315–423&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a definition analysis by Kompf &amp; Bond (2001), critical thinking involves problem solving, decision making, [[metacognition]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://serc.carleton.edu/NAGTWorkshops/metacognition/teaching_metacognition.html|title=Teaching Metacognition|website=Metacognition|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; rationality, rational thinking, [[reasoning]], [[knowledge]], [[intelligence]] and also a moral component such as reflective thinking. Critical thinkers therefore need to have reached a level of maturity in their development, possess a certain attitude as well as a set of taught skills.

==Research==
Edward M. Glaser proposed that the ability to think critically involves three elements:&lt;ref name=glaser/&gt;

#An attitude of being disposed to consider in a thoughtful way the problems and subjects that come within the range of one's experiences
#Knowledge of the methods of logical [[inquiry]] and reasoning
#Some skill in applying those methods.
Educational programs aimed at developing critical thinking in children and adult learners, individually or in group problem solving and decision making contexts, continue to address these same three central elements.

The Critical Thinking project at Human Science Lab, [[London]], is involved in scientific study of all major [[educational system]] in prevalence today to assess how the systems are working to promote or impede critical thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://humansciencelab.org.uk/research/| title=Research at Human Science Lab |publisher=Human Science Lab | access-date=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary cognitive psychology regards human reasoning as a complex process that is both reactive and reflective.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, S.A.

The relationship between critical thinking skills and critical thinking dispositions is an empirical question. Some people have both in abundance, some have skills but not the disposition to use them, some are disposed but lack strong skills, and some have neither. A measure of critical thinking dispositions is the California Measure of Mental Motivation&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OT12dZ0binIC&amp;pg=PA46 ''Research on Sociocultural Influences on Motivation and Learning''], p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; and the California Critical Thinking Dispositions Inventory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walsh|first=Catherine, M.|date=2007|title=California Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory: Further Factor Analytic Examination|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.2466/pms.104.1.141-151|journal=SAGE|volume=104|pages=141–151|via=SAGE|doi=10.2466/pms.104.1.141-151}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CriTT is an alternative measure that examines student beliefs and attitudes about critical thinking&lt;ref&gt;Stupple, E. J. N., Maratos, F. A., Elander, J., Hunt, T. E., Cheung, K. Y., &amp; Aubeeluck, A. V. (2017). Development of the Critical Thinking Toolkit (CriTT): A measure of student attitudes and beliefs about critical thinking. Thinking Skills and Creativity, 23, 91-100.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
[[John Dewey]] is one of many educational leaders who recognized that a curriculum aimed at building thinking skills would benefit the individual learner, the community, and the entire democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, John. (1910). ''How we think.'' Lexington, MA: D.C. Heath &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical thinking is significant in academics due to being significant in learning. Critical thinking is significant in the learning process of [[internalization]], in the construction of basic ideas, principles, and theories inherent in content.  And critical thinking is significant in the learning process of application, whereby those ideas, principles, and theories are implemented effectively as they become relevant in learners' lives.

Each discipline adapts its use of critical thinking concepts and principles. The core concepts are always there, but they are embedded in subject-specific content. For students to learn content, intellectual engagement is crucial. All students must do their own thinking, their own construction of knowledge. Good teachers recognize this and therefore focus on the questions, readings, activities that stimulate the mind to take ownership of key concepts and principles underlying the subject.

Historically, teaching of critical thinking focused only on logical procedures such as formal and informal logic. This emphasized to students that good thinking is equivalent to logical thinking. However, a second wave of critical thinking, urges educators to value conventional techniques, meanwhile expanding what it means to be a critical thinker. In 1994, Kerry Walters&lt;ref&gt;Walters, Kerry. (1994). ''Re-Thinking Reason''. Albany, NY: State University of New York Press.&lt;/ref&gt; compiled a conglomeration of sources surpassing this logical restriction to include many different authors’ research regarding connected knowing, empathy, gender-sensitive ideals, collaboration, world views, intellectual autonomy, morality and enlightenment. These concepts invite students to incorporate their own perspectives and experiences into their thinking.

In the English and Welsh school systems, ''Critical Thinking'' is offered as a subject that 16- to 18-year-olds can take as an [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-Level]]. Under the [[OCR (exam board)|OCR]] [[exam board]], students can sit two exam papers for the AS: "Credibility of Evidence" and "Assessing and Developing Argument". The full Advanced [[General Certificate of Education|GCE]] is now available: in addition to the two AS units, candidates sit the two papers "Resolution of Dilemmas" and "Critical Reasoning". The A-level tests candidates on their ability to think critically about, and analyze, arguments on their deductive or inductive validity, as well as producing their own arguments. It also tests their ability to analyze certain related topics such as credibility and ethical decision-making. However, due to its comparative lack of subject content, many universities do not accept it as a main A-level for admissions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ocr.org.uk/qualifications/asa_levelgceforfirstteachingin2008/critical_thinking/faqs.html Critical Thinking FAQs from Oxford Cambridge and RSA Examinations] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411150135/http://www.ocr.org.uk/qualifications/asa_levelgceforfirstteachingin2008/critical_thinking/faqs.html |date=11 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the AS is often useful in developing reasoning skills, and the full Advanced [[General Certificate of Education|GCE]] is useful for degree courses in politics, philosophy, history or [[theology]], providing the skills required for critical analysis that are useful, for example, in biblical study.

There used to also be an [[Advanced Extension Award]] offered in Critical Thinking in the UK, open to any A-level student regardless of whether they have the Critical Thinking A-level. [[Cambridge International Examinations]] have an A-level in Thinking Skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cie.org.uk/qualifications/academic/uppersec/alevel/subject/aleveldetails?assdef_id=765_804|title=Cambridge International AS and A Level subjects|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2008, [[Assessment and Qualifications Alliance]] has also been offering an A-level Critical Thinking specification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aqa.org.uk/qual/gce/critical_thinking_new.php "New GCEs for 2008"], Assessment and Qualifications Alliance {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217221100/http://www.aqa.org.uk/qual/gce/critical_thinking_new.php |date=17 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[OCR (exam board)|OCR]] [[exam board]] have also modified theirs for 2008. Many examinations for university entrance set by universities, on top of A-level examinations, also include a critical thinking component, such as the [[LNAT]], the [[UKCAT]], the [[BioMedical Admissions Test]] and the [[Thinking Skills Assessment]].

In [[Qatar]], critical thinking was offered by [[AL-Bairaq]]—an outreach, non-traditional educational program that targets high school students and focuses on a curriculum based on [[STEM fields]]. The idea behind [[AL-Bairaq]] is to offer high school students the opportunity to connect with the research environment in the Center for Advanced Materials (CAM) at Qatar University. Faculty members train and mentor the students and help develop and enhance their critical thinking, problem-solving, and teamwork skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qu.edu.qa/offices/research/CAM/dmsprogram/index.php |accessdate=5 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419220638/http://www.qu.edu.qa/offices/research/CAM/dmsprogram/index.php |title=
Welcome to Al-Bairaq World |archivedate=19 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=November 2016}}

===Efficacy===
In 1995, a meta-analysis of the literature on teaching effectiveness in higher [[education]] was undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;Lion Gardiner, Redesigning Higher Education: Producing Dramatic Gains in Student Learning, in conjunction with: ERIC Clearinghouse on Higher Education, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;
The study noted concerns from higher [[education]], [[politician]]s, and [[business]] that higher education was failing to meet society's requirements for well-educated citizens.  It concluded that although faculty may aspire to develop students' [[thinking]] skills, in practice they have tended to aim at facts and concepts utilizing lowest levels of [[cognition]], rather than developing intellect or [[values]].

In a more recent meta-analysis, researchers reviewed 341 quasi- or true-experimental studies, all of which used some form of standardized critical thinking measure to assess the outcome variable.&lt;ref name="Abrami, P. C. 2014"&gt;Abrami, P. C., Bernard, R. M., Borokhovski, E., Waddington, D. I., Wade, C. A., &amp; Persson, T. (2014). Strategies for Teaching Students to Think Critically: A Meta-Analysis. Review of Educational Research, 1–40&lt;/ref&gt; The authors describe the various methodological approaches and attempt to categorize the differing assessment tools, which include standardized tests (and second-source measures), tests developed by teachers, tests developed by researchers, and tests developed by teachers who also serve the role as the [[researcher]].  The results emphasized the need for exposing students to real-world problems and the importance in encouraging open dialogue within a supportive environment.  Effective strategies for teaching critical thinking are thought to be possible in a wide variety of [[educational]] settings.&lt;ref name="Abrami, P. C. 2014"/&gt; One attempt to assess the [[humanities]]' role in teaching critical thinking and reducing belief in [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] claims was made at [[North Carolina State University]]. Some success was noted and the researchers emphasized the value of the humanities in providing the skills to evaluate current events and qualitative data in context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frazier |first1=Kendrick |authorlink1=Kendrick Frazier |title=Humanities, Too: In New Study, History Courses in Critical Thinking Reduce Pseudoscientific Beliefs |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2017 |volume=41 |issue=4 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Scott Lilienfeld]] notes that there is some evidence to suggest that basic critical thinking skills might be successfully taught to children at a younger age than previously thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lilienfeld |first1=Scott |authorlink1=Scott Lilienfeld |title=Teaching Skepticism: How Early Can We Begin? |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2017 |volume=41 |issue=5 |pages=30-31 |url=https://www.csicop.org/si/show/teaching_skepticism_how_early_can_we_begin |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810182835/https://www.csicop.org/si/show/teaching_skepticism_how_early_can_we_begin |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2018-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance in academia==
Critical thinking is an important element of all professional fields and academic disciplines (by referencing their respective sets of permissible questions, evidence sources, criteria, etc.). Within the framework of [[scientific skepticism]], the process of critical thinking involves the careful acquisition and interpretation of information and use of it to reach a [[theory of justification|well-justified]] conclusion. The concepts and principles of critical thinking can be applied to any context or case but only by reflecting upon the nature of that application. Critical thinking forms, therefore, a system of related, and overlapping, modes of thought such as anthropological thinking, sociological thinking, historical thinking, political thinking, [[psychological]] thinking, philosophical thinking, mathematical thinking, chemical thinking, biological thinking, ecological thinking, legal thinking, ethical thinking, musical thinking, thinking like a painter, sculptor, engineer, business person, etc. In other words, though critical thinking principles are universal, their application to disciplines requires a process of reflective [[contextualism|contextualization]].

Critical thinking is considered important in the academic fields because it enables one to analyze, evaluate, explain, and restructure their thinking, thereby decreasing the risk of adopting, acting on, or thinking with, a false belief. However, even with knowledge of the methods of logical inquiry and reasoning, mistakes can happen due to a thinker's inability to apply the methods or because of character traits such as [[egocentrism]]. Critical thinking includes identification of [[prejudice]], [[bias]], propaganda, self-deception, distortion, [[misinformation]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://philosophy.hku.hk/think/fallacy/biases.php |title=[F08] Cognitive biases |last1=Lau |first1=Joe |last2=Chan |first2=Jonathan |date= |website=Critical thinking web |publisher= |access-date=2016-02-01 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given research in [[cognitive psychology]], some [[education|educators]] believe that schools should focus on teaching their students critical thinking [[skill]]s and cultivation of intellectual traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.criticalthinking.org/pages/critical-thinking-moral-integrity-and-citizenship-teaching-for-the-intellectual-virtues/487 |title=Critical Thinking, Moral Integrity and Citizenship |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=Criticalthinking.org |publisher= |access-date=2016-02-01 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical thinking skills can be used to help nurses during the assessment process. Through the use of critical thinking, nurses can question, evaluate, and reconstruct the nursing care process by challenging the established theory and practice. Critical thinking skills can help nurses problem solve, reflect, and make a conclusive decision about the current situation they face. Critical thinking creates "new possibilities for the development of the nursing knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;Catching the wave: understanding the concept of critical thinking (1999) {{DOI|10.1046/j.1365-2648.1999.00925.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the sociocultural, environmental, and political issues that are affecting healthcare delivery, it would be helpful to embody new techniques in nursing. Nurses can also engage their critical thinking skills through the Socratic method of dialogue and reflection. This practice standard is even part of some regulatory organizations such as the College of Nurses of Ontario – Professional Standards for Continuing Competencies (2006).&lt;ref&gt;College of Nurses of Ontario – Professional Standards for 
[http://www.cno.org/Global/4-LearnAboutStandardsAndGuidelines/prac/learn/modules/profstands/slides/Competence.pdf Continuing Competencies (2006)]&lt;/ref&gt;
It requires nurses to engage in [[Reflective Practice]] and keep records of this continued professional development for possible review by the College.

Critical thinking is also considered important for [[human rights education]] for [[toleration]]. The [[International Day for Tolerance|Declaration of Principles on Tolerance]] adopted by [[UNESCO]] in 1995 affirms that "education for tolerance could aim at countering factors that lead to fear and exclusion of others, and could help young people to develop capacities for independent judgement, ''critical thinking'' and ethical [[reasoning]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=UNESCO |title=International Day for Tolerance . Declaration of Principles on Tolerance, Article 4, 3 |url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13175&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical thinking is used as a way of deciding whether a claim is true, partially true, or false. It is a tool by which one can come about reasoned conclusions based on a reasoned process.

==In computer-mediated communication==
The advent and rising popularity of online courses has prompted some to ask if computer-mediated communication (CMC) promotes, hinders, or has no effect on the amount and quality of critical thinking in a course (relative to face-to-face communication). There is some evidence to suggest a fourth, more nuanced possibility: that CMC may promote some aspects of critical thinking but hinder others. For example, Guiller et al. (2008)&lt;ref name="Guiller2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guiller|first1=Jane|last2=Durndell|first2=Alan|last3=Ross|first3=Anne|title=Peer interaction and critical thinking: Face-to-face or online discussion?|journal=Learning and Instruction|date=2008|volume=18|pages=187–200|doi=10.1016/j.learninstruc.2007.03.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that, relative to face-to-face discourse, online discourse featured more justifications, while face-to-face discourse featured more instances of students expanding on what others had said. The increase in justifications may be due to the asynchronous nature of online discussions, while the increase in expanding comments may be due to the spontaneity of ‘real time’ discussion. Newman et al. (1995)&lt;ref name="Newman1995"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Newman|first1=D R|last2=Webb|first2=Brian|last3=Cochrane|first3=Clive|title=A content analysis method to measure critical thinking in face-to-face and computer supported group learning|journal=Interpersonal Computing and Technology|date=1995|volume=3|issue=September 1993|pages=56–77|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2648.2007.04569.x|pmid=18352969}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed similar differential effects. They found that while CMC boasted more important statements and linking of ideas, it lacked novelty. The authors suggest that this may be due to difficulties participating in a brainstorming-style activity in an asynchronous environment. Rather, the asynchrony may promote users to put forth “considered, thought out contributions.”

Researchers assessing critical thinking in online discussion forums often employ a technique called Content Analysis,&lt;ref name="Newman1995" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guiller2008" /&gt; where the text of online discourse (or the transcription of face-to-face discourse) is systematically coded for different kinds of statements relating to critical thinking. For example, a statement might be coded as “Discuss ambiguities to clear them up” or “Welcoming outside knowledge” as positive indicators of critical thinking. Conversely, statements reflecting poor critical thinking may be labeled as “Sticking to prejudice or assumptions” or “Squashing attempts to bring in outside knowledge.” The frequency of these codes in CMC and face-to-face discourse can be compared to draw conclusions about the quality of critical thinking.

Searching for evidence of critical thinking in discourse has roots in a definition of critical thinking put forth by Kuhn (1991),&lt;ref name="Kuhn1991"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kuhn|first1=D|title=The skills of argument|date=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; which emphasizes the social nature of discussion and knowledge construction. There is limited research on the role of social experience in critical thinking development, but there is some evidence to suggest it is an important factor. For example, research has shown that 3- to 4-year-old children can discern, to some extent, the differential creditability&lt;ref name="Koenig2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koenig|first1=M A|last2=Harris|first2=P L|title=Preschoolers mistrust ignorant and inaccurate speakers|journal=Child Development|date=2005|volume=76|pages=1261–77|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2005.00849.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and expertise&lt;ref name="Lutz2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lutz|first1=D J|last2=Keil|first2=F C|title=Early understanding of the division of cognitive labor|journal=Child Development|date=2002|volume=73|pages=1073–84|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00458}}&lt;/ref&gt; of individuals. Further evidence for the impact of social experience on the development of critical thinking skills comes from work that found that 6- to 7-year-olds from China have similar levels of skepticism to 10- and 11-year-olds in the United States.&lt;ref name="Heyman2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heyman|first1=G D|last2=Fu|first2=G|last3=Lee|first3=K|title=Evaluating claims peoplemake about themselves: The development of skepticism|journal=Child Development|date=2007|volume=78|pages=367–75|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2007.01003.x|pmc=2570105}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the development of critical thinking skills was solely due to maturation, it is unlikely we would see such dramatic differences across cultures.

'''Duration''' (French: ''la durée'') is a theory of [[time]] and [[consciousness]] posited by the [[France|French]] [[philosophy|philosopher]] [[Henri Bergson]]. Bergson sought to improve upon inadequacies he perceived in the philosophy of [[Herbert Spencer]], due, he believed, to Spencer's lack of comprehension of [[mechanics]], which led Bergson to the conclusion that time eluded mathematics and science.&lt;ref name="The_Creative_Mind"&gt;Henri Bergson, ''The Creative Mind: An Introduction to Metaphysics'', pages 11 to 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Bergson became aware that the moment one attempted to measure a moment, it would be gone: one measures an immobile, complete line, whereas time is mobile and incomplete. For the individual, time may speed up or slow down, whereas, for science, it would remain the same. Hence Bergson decided to explore the inner life of man, which is a kind of duration, neither a unity nor a quantitative [[Multiplicity (philosophy)|multiplicity]].&lt;ref name="The_Creative_Mind"/&gt; Duration is ineffable and can only be shown indirectly through images that can never reveal a complete picture. It can only be grasped through a simple [[Intuition (Bergson)|intuition]] of the imagination.&lt;ref name="Henri Bergson pages 165"&gt;Henri Bergson, ''The Creative Mind: An Introduction to Metaphysics'', pages 165 to 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bergson first introduced his notion of duration in his essay ''Time and Free Will: An Essay on the Immediate Data of Consciousness''. It is used as a defense of [[free will]] in a response to [[Immanuel Kant]], who believed free will was only possible outside time and space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bergson/ The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy] ''Time and Free Will has to be seen as an attack on Kant, for whom freedom belongs to a realm outside of space and time.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responses to Kant and Zeno==
[[Image:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumbnail|left|150px|Immanuel Kant, who believed [[free will]] was only a pragmatic belief.]]

[[Zeno of Elea]] believed reality was an uncreated and indestructible immobile whole.&lt;ref&gt;Parmenides, ''On Nature''.&lt;/ref&gt; He formulated [[Zeno's paradoxes|four paradoxes]] to present mobility as an impossibility. We can never, he said, move past a single point because each point is infinitely divisible, and it is impossible to cross an infinite space.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Physics'', VI:9, 239b10.&lt;/ref&gt; But to Bergson, the problem only arises when mobility and time, that is, duration, are mistaken for the spatial line that underlies them. Time and mobility are mistakenly treated as things, not progressions.  They are treated retrospectively as a thing's spatial trajectory, which can be divided ''ad infinitum'', whereas they are, in fact, an indivisible whole.&lt;ref&gt;Henri Bergson, ''Matter and Memory'', pages 191 to 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bergson’s response to Kant is that free will is possible within a duration within which time resides. Free will is not really a problem but merely a common confusion among philosophers caused by the immobile time of science.&lt;ref&gt;Henri Bergson, ''Time and Free Will: An Essay on the Immediate Data of Consciousness'', Author's Preface.&lt;/ref&gt; To measure duration (''durée''), it must be translated into the immobile, spatial time (''temps'') of science, a translation of the unextended into the extended. It is through this translation that the problem of free will arises. Since space is a homogeneous, quantitative [[Multiplicity (philosophy)|multiplicity]], duration becomes juxtaposed and converted into a succession of distinct parts, one coming after the other and therefore "caused" by one another. Nothing within a duration can be the cause of anything else within it. Hence [[determinism]], the belief everything is determined by a prior cause, is an impossibility. One must accept time as it really is through placing oneself within duration where freedom can be identified and experienced as pure mobility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bergson/ The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy] ''For Bergson — and perhaps this is his greatest insight — freedom is mobility.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Images of duration==

In ''An Introduction to Metaphysics'', Bergson presents three images of duration. The first is of two spools, one unrolling to represent the continuous flow of ageing as one feels oneself moving toward the end of one's life-span, the other rolling up to represent the continuous growth of memory which, for Bergson, equals consciousness. No two successive moments are identical, for the one will always contain the memory left by the other. A person with no memory might experience two identical moments but, Bergson says, that person's consciousness would thus be in a constant state of death and rebirth, which he identifies with unconsciousness.&lt;ref name="Creative_Mind"&gt;Henri Bergson, ''The Creative Mind: An Introduction to Metaphysics'', pages 164 to 165.&lt;/ref&gt; The image of two spools, however, is of a homogeneous and commensurable thread, whereas, according to Bergson, no two moments can be the same, hence duration is heterogeneous.

Bergson then presents the image of a spectrum of a thousand gradually changing shades with a line of feeling running through them, being both affected by and maintaining each of the shades. Yet even this image is inaccurate and incomplete, for it represents duration as a fixed and complete spectrum with all the shades spatially juxtaposed, whereas duration is incomplete and continuously growing, its states not beginning or ending but intermingling.&lt;ref name="Creative_Mind"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henri Bergson, ''The Creative Mind: An Introduction to Metaphysics'', page 163: ''Strictly speaking they do not constitute multiple states until I have already got beyond them, and turn around to observe their trail. [...] In reality, none of them begins or ends; they all dovetail into one another.''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|''Instead, let us imagine an infinitely small piece of elastic, contracted, if that were possible, to a mathematical point. Let us draw it out gradually in such a way as to bring out of the point a line which will grow progressively longer. Let us fix our attention not on the line as line, but on the action which traces it. Let us consider that this action, in spite of its duration, is indivisible if one supposes that it goes on without stopping; that, if we intercalate a stop in it, we make two actions of it instead of one and that each of these actions will then be the indivisible of which we speak; that it is not the moving act itself which is never indivisible, but the motionless line it lays down beneath it like a track in space. Let us take our mind off the space subtending the movement and concentrate solely on the movement itself, on the act of tension or extension, in short, on pure mobility. This time we shall have a more exact image of our development in duration.''|20px|20px|[[Henri Bergson]]|''The Creative Mind: An Introduction to Metaphysics'', pages 164 to 165.}}

Even this image is incomplete, because the wealth of colouring is forgotten when it is invoked.&lt;ref name="Creative_Mind"/&gt; But as the three images illustrate, it can be stated that duration is qualitative, unextended, multiple yet a unity, mobile and continuously interpenetrating itself. Yet these concepts put side-by-side can never adequately represent duration itself;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The truth is we change without ceasing...there is no essential difference between passing from one state to another and persisting in the same state. If the state which "remains the same" is more varied than we think, [then] on the other hand the passing of one state to another resembles—more than we imagine—a single state being prolonged: the transition is continuous.  Just because we close our eyes to the unceasing variation of every physical state, we are obliged when the change has become so formidable as to force itself on our attention, to speak as if a new state were placed alongside the previous one. Of this new state we assume that it remains unvarying in its turn and so on endlessly.''&lt;ref&gt;Henri Bergson, Creative Evolution (1911) tr. Arthur Mitchell, Henry Holt and Company&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Because a qualitative [[Multiplicity (philosophy)|multiplicity]] is heterogeneous and yet interpenetrating, it cannot be adequately represented by a symbol; indeed, for Bergson, a qualitative multiplicity is inexpressible. Thus, to grasp duration, one must reverse habitual modes of thought and place oneself within duration by intuition.&lt;ref name="Henri Bergson pages 165"/&gt;

==Physics and Bergson’s ideas==
Bergson’s ideas concerning the [[philosophy of time]] were somewhat rediscovered after a paper 
on Zeno’s paradox was published in ''Foundations of Physics Letters'' and generated interest in 2003. The writer, Peter Lynds, was credited with producing an original new insight.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/education/2003/aug/14/research.highereducation ''The strange story of Peter Lynds''] - David Adam, The Guardian, Thursday 14 August 2003 02.41 BST&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was noted in a journal article shortly after that the ideas in this paper were preceded by Henri Bergson, evidently unbeknownst to Lynds or his paper's referees.&lt;ref&gt;S E Robbins (2004) On time, memory and dynamic form. Consciousness and Cognition 13(4), 762-788: "Lynds, his reviewers and consultants (e.g., J.J.C. Smart) are apparently unaware of his total precedence by Bergson"&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14161">An '''enantiopure drug''' is a pharmaceutical that is available in one specific [[enantiomer]]ic form. Most biological molecules (proteins, sugars, etc.) are present in only one of many [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] forms, so different enantiomers of a chiral drug molecule bind differently (or not at all) to target [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s. One enantiomer of a drug may have a desired beneficial effect while the other may cause serious and undesired side effects, or sometimes even beneficial but entirely different effects.&lt;ref name=Ariens&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ariëns |first1= E. J. |year= 1984 |title= Stereochemistry, a basis for sophisticated nonsense in pharmacokinetics and clinical pharmacology |url= http://www.springerlink.com/content/ng657086x6u73p44/ |journal= European Journal of Clinical Pharmacology |volume= 26 |issue= 6 |pages= 663–668 |doi= 10.1007/BF00541922 |pmid=6092093}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Advances in industrial chemical processes have made it economical for pharmaceutical manufacturers to take drugs that were originally marketed as a racemic mixture and market the individual enantiomers, either by specifically manufacturing the desired enantiomer or by [[chiral resolution|resolving]] a [[racemic mixture]]. On a case-by-case basis, the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has allowed single enantiomers of certain drugs to be marketed under a different name than the racemic mixture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm122883.htm US FDA's policy statement on the development of new stereoisomeric drugs]&lt;/ref&gt; Also case-by-case, the United States Patent Office has granted patents for single enantiomers of certain drugs. The regulatory review for marketing approval (safety and efficacy) and for patenting (proprietary rights) is independent, and differs country by country.

==Importance==
''Selectivity'' is a very important part of organic synthesis. In scientific papers regarding synthesis, selectivity is often listed in data tables alongside percent yield and other reaction conditions. While selectivity is deemed important in scientific literature, it has been challenging to effectively implement selectivity in drug development and production. A major issue with selectivity in [[pharmaceuticals]] is that a large percentage of drug syntheses by nature are not selective reactions, racemic mixtures are formed as the products. Separating racemic mixtures into their respective enantiomers takes extra time, money, and energy. One way to separate enantiomers is to chemically convert them into species that can be separated: diastereomers. Diastereomers, unlike enantiomers, have entirely different physical properties—boiling points, melting points, NMR shifts, solubilities—and they can be separated by conventional means such as [[chromatography]] or [[recrystallization (chemistry)|recrystallization]]. This is a whole extra step in the synthesis process and not desirable from a manufacturing standpoint.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chemhelper.com/enantiomersep.html Separation of Enantiomers http://www.chemhelper.com/enantiomersep.html. Retrieved 2016-04-13.]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, a number of pharmaceuticals are synthesized and marketed as a racemic mixture of enantiomers in cases where the less-effective enantiomer is benign. However, by identifying and specifically purifying the enantiomer which effectively binds to its respective [[binding site]] in the body, less of the drug would be needed to achieve the desired effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Owens|first1=Michael|title=Stereochemistry in Drug Action|pages=70–73|language=English|pmc=353039|pmid=15156233|volume=5|issue=2|journal=Prim Care Companion J Clin Psychiatry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criteria==

According to the FDA, the stereoisomeric composition of a chiral drug should be known, and its effects should be well-characterized from pharmacologic, toxicologic, and clinical standpoints. In order to profile the different stereoisomers of enantiopure drugs, manufacturers are urged to develop quantitative assays for individual enantiomers in ''in vivo'' samples early in the development stage.

Ideally, the main pharmacologic activities of the isomers should be compared in ''in vitro'' systems in animals. During instances when toxic findings are present beyond the natural extensions of the pharmacologic effects of the drug, toxicologic evaluation of the individual isomers in question must be completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm122883.htm|title=Guidances (Drugs) - Development of New Stereoisomeric Drugs|last=Research|first=Center for Drug Evaluation and|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patenting==

When drugs are covered under patent protection, only the pharmaceutical company that holds the patent is allowed to manufacture, market, and eventually profit from them. The lifetime of the patent varies between countries and also between drugs; in the United States, most drug patents last about twenty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/ucm079031.htm|title=Development &amp; Approval Process (Drugs) - Frequently Asked Questions on Patents and Exclusivity|last=Research|first=Center for Drug Evaluation and|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the patent has expired, the drug can be manufactured and sold by other companies - at which point, it is referred to as a [[generic drug]]. Its availability on the market as a generic drug removes the monopoly of the patent holder, thereby encouraging competition and causing a significant drop in drug prices, which ensures that life-saving and important drugs reach the general population at fair prices. However, the company holding the initial patent may get a new patent by forming a new version of the drug that is significantly changed compared to the original compound.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.news-medical.net/health/Drug-Patents-and-Generics.aspx|title=Drug Patents and Generic Pharmaceutical Drugs|website=News-Medical.net|access-date=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patentability of different isomers has been controversial over the past ten years and there have been a number of related legal issues. In making their determinations, courts have looked at factors including: (i) whether the racemate was known in the prior art; (ii) the difficulty in resolving the enantiomer; (iii) the [[stereoselectivity]] of the relevant receptor; and (iv) other secondary considerations of non-obviousness such as commercial success, unexpected results, and satisfaction of long-felt needs in the art. The decisions made regarding these issues have varied and there is no clear answer to the legality of patenting stereoisomers. These issues have been resolved on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sodikoff|first1=Brian|title=Enantiomer Patents: Innovative or Obvious?|url=https://www.kattenlaw.com/files/52074_Enantiomer_Patents_Innovative_or_Obvious.pdf|website=Kattenlaw|accessdate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the number of current pharmaceuticals currently being marketed as [[racemic mixture]]s, it is likely that patentability will continue to be debated in the near future.

The following are cases where the individual enantiomers have markedly different effects:
[[File:Thalidomide-racemate2DCSD.svg|thumb|400px|The ''S'' enantiomer causes birth defects, while the ''R'' enantiomer is effective against morning sickness.]]
*[[Thalidomide]]: Thalidomide is racemic. One enantiomer is effective against [[morning sickness]], whereas the other is [[teratology|teratogenic]]. However, the enantiomers are converted into each other ''[[in vivo]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Clin. Pharmacokinet. |year= 2004 |volume= 43 |issue= 5 |pages= 311–327 |title= Clinical pharmacokinetics of thalidomide |pmid= 15080764 |vauthors=Teo SK, Colburn WA, Tracewell WG, Kook KA, Stirling DI, Jaworsky MS, Scheffler MA, Thomas SD, Laskin OL |doi= 10.2165/00003088-200443050-00004}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, dosing with a single-enantiomer form of the drug will still lead to both the enantiomers eventually being present in the patient's serum and thus would not prevent adverse effects—at best, it might reduce them if the rate of [[prodrug|''in vivo'' conversion]] can be slowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Silas|title=Chiral Toxicology: It's the Same Thing...

[[File:Positive enantiomer of ethambutol.png|thumbnail|Enantiomer of ethambutol used to treat tuberculosis|left]]
[[File:Negative enantiomer of ethambutol.png|thumbnail|Enantiomer of ethambutol that causes blindness|left]]

*[[Naproxen]]: (''S'')-(+)-naproxen is used to treat arthritis pain, but (''R'')-(–)-naproxen causes liver poisoning with no analgesic effect.
*[[Steroid]] receptor sites also show [[stereoisomerism|stereoisomer]] specificity.
*[[Penicillin]]'s activity is stereodependent. The antibiotic must mimic the &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-alanine chains that occur in the cell walls of bacteria in order to react with and subsequently inhibit bacterial transpeptidase enzyme.
*[[Propranolol]]: &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-propranolol is a powerful [[adrenoceptor antagonist]], whereas &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-propranolol is not. However, both have [[local anesthetic]] effect.
*Methorphan: The &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-isomer of methorphan, [[levomethorphan]], is a potent opioid analgesic, while the &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-isomer, [[dextromethorphan]], is a dissociative cough suppressant.
*[[Carvedilol]]: (''S'')-(–)-isomer interacts with [[adrenoceptor]]s with 100 times greater potency as [[beta blocker|β adrenoreceptor blocker]] than (''R'')-(+)-isomer. However, both the isomers are approximately equipotent as [[alpha blocker|α adrenoreceptor blockers]].
*[[Amphetamine]] and [[methamphetamine]]: The &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-isomers of these drugs are strong central nervous system (CNS) stimulants, while the &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-isomers lack appreciable CNS stimulant effects, but instead stimulate the peripheral nervous system. For this reason, the &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-isomer of methamphetamine is available as an over-the-counter nasal inhaler in some countries, while the &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-isomer is banned from medical use in all but a few countries in the world, and highly regulated in those countries which do allow it to be used medically.

With the exception of the yeast protein (627 amino acyl residues), all characterized members of the family are of 256-285 residues in length and exhibit 6-8 putative transmembrane α-helical spanners (TMSs). In one case, that of the ''E. coli'' FocA ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.A.16.1.1 TC# 1.A.16.1.1]) protein, a 6 TMS topology has been established.&lt;ref name = "Wang_2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang Y, Huang Y, Wang J, Cheng C, Huang W, Lu P, Xu YN, Wang P, Yan N, Shi Y | title = Structure of the formate transporter FocA reveals a pentameric aquaporin-like channel | journal = Nature | volume = 462 | issue = 7272 | pages = 467–72 | date = November 2009 | pmid = 19940917 | doi = 10.1038/nature08610 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The yeast protein has a similar apparent topology but has a large C-terminal hydrophilic extension of about 400 residues.

FocA of ''E. coli'' is a symmetriv [[pentamer]], with each subunit consisting of six TMSs.&lt;ref name = "Wang_2009" /&gt;

== Phylogeny ==
The phylogenetic tree shows clustering according to function and organismal phylogeny. The putative formate efflux transporters (FocA; TC#s [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.A.16.1.1 1.A.16.1.1] and [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.A.16.1.3 1.A.16.1.3]) of bacteria associated with pyruvate-formate lyase (pfl) comprise cluster I; the putative formate uptake permeases (FdhC; TC#s [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.A.16.2.1 1.A.16.2.1] and [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.A.16.2.3 1.A.16.2.3]) of bacteria and archaea associated with formate dehydrogenase comprise cluster II; the nitrite uptake permeases (NirC, TC#s [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.A.16.2.5 1.A.16.2.5], [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.A.16.3.1 1.A.16.3.1], and [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.A.16.2.4 1.A.16.3.4]) of bacteria comprise cluster III, and a yeast protein comprises cluster IV.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.A.16#ref9123|title = 1.A.16 The Formate-Nitrite Transporter (FNT) Family|date = |access-date = |website = Transporter Classification Database|publisher = Saier Lab Bioinformatics Group / SDSC|last = Saier|first = MH Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==
The energy coupling mechanisms for proteins of the FNT family have not been extensively characterized. HCO{{su|b=2|p=−}} and NO{{su|b=2|p=−}} uptakes may be coupled to H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; symport. HCO{{su|b=2|p=−}} efflux may be driven by the membrane potential by a uniport mechanism or by H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; antiport. FocA of ''E. coli'' catalyzes bidirectional [[formate]] transport and may function by a channel-type mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Falke D, Schulz K, Doberenz C, Beyer L, Lilie H, Thiemer B, Sawers RG | title = Unexpected oligomeric structure of the FocA formate channel of Escherichia coli : a paradigm for the formate-nitrite transporter family of integral membrane proteins | journal = FEMS Microbiology Letters | volume = 303 | issue = 1 | pages = 69–75 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 20041954 | doi = 10.1111/j.1574-6968.2009.01862.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

FocA, transports short-chain acids. FocA may be able to switch its mode of operation from a passive export channel at high external pH to a secondary active formate/H+ importer at low pH. The crystal structure of ''[[Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica|Salmonella typhimurium]]'' FocA at pH 4.0 shows that this switch involves a major rearrangement of the amino termini of individual protomers in the pentameric channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lü W, Du J, Wacker T, Gerbig-Smentek E, Andrade SL, Einsle O | title = pH-dependent gating in a FocA formate channel | journal = Science | volume = 332 | issue = 6027 | pages = 352–4 | date = April 2011 | pmid = 21493860 | doi = 10.1126/science.1199098 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The amino-terminal helices open or block transport in a concerted, cooperative action that indicates how FocA is gated in a pH-dependent way. Electrophysiological studies show that the protein acts as a specific formate channel at pH 7.0 and that it closes upon a shift of pH to 5.1.

=== Transport Reaction ===
The probable transport reactions catalyzed by different members of the FNT family are:

(1) RCO{{su|b=2|p=−}} or NO{{su|b=2|p=−}} (out) ⇌ RCO{{su|b=2|p=−}} or NO{{su|b=2|p=−}} (in),

(2) HCO{{su|b=2|p=−}} (in) ⇌ HCO{{su|b=2|p=−}} (out),

(3) HS&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (out) ⇌ HS&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (in).

== Members ==
A representative list of the currently classified members belonging to the FNT family can be found in the [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.A.16.5 Transporter Classification Database]. Some characterized members include:

*FocA and FocB (TC#s [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.A.16.1.1 1.A.16.1.1] and [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.A.16.1.2 1.A.16.1.2], respectively), from ''Escherichia coli'', [[membrane transporter protein|transporter]]s involved in the bidirectional [[transport]] of formate. 
*FdhC, from ''Methanobacterium maripaludis'' (TC# [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.A.16.2.3 1.A.16.2.3]) and ''Methanothermobacter'' thermoformicicum (TC# [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.A.16.2.1 1.A.16.2.1]), a probable formate transporter. 
*NirC, from E. coli (TC# [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.A.16.3.1 1.A.16.3.1]), a probable nitrite transporter. 
*Nar1 (TC# [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.A.16.2.4 1.A.16.2.4]) of ''Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Chlamydomonas smithii),'' a nitrite uptake porter of 355 amino acyl residues. 
*B. subtilis hypothetical protein YwcJ (ipa-48R) (TC# [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.A.16.3.2 1.A.16.3.2]).

'''Holism''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ὅλος}} ''holos'' "all, whole, entire") is the idea that [[system]]s (physical, biological, chemical, social, economic, mental, linguistic) and their properties should be viewed as wholes, not just as a collection of parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Barry | last = Oshry | title = Seeing Systems: Unlocking the Mysteries of Organizational Life | publisher = Berrett-Koehler | year = 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Sunny Y | last = Auyang | title = Foundations of Complex-system Theories: in Economics, Evolutionary Biology, and Statistical Physics | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term holism was coined by [[Jan_Smuts|Jan Smuts]].&lt;ref name="HaE"&gt;{{ cite book | first = Jan Christiaan | last = Smuts | title = Holism and Evolution 2nd Edition |publisher = Macmillan and Co | year = 1927 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The first publication of ''Holism and Evolution'' was by Macmillan and Co. in 1926. Smuts published a 2nd edition in 1927 and there have been at least three subsequent reprints; Compass/Viking Press 1961, Greenwood Press 1973, and Sierra Sunrise Books 1999 (a version edited by Sanford Holst). The full text of the 1927 2nd edition is available on the Internet Archive site, and this is the source used in updating the Holism page.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred Adler]] considered holism as a concept that represents all of the wholes in the universe, and these wholes are the real factors in the universe. Further, that Holism also denoted a theory of the universe in the same vein as Materialism and Spiritualism.&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|120–121}}

== Synopsis of ''Holism and Evolution'' ==
After identifying the need for reform in the fundamental concepts of matter, life and mind (chapter 1) Smuts examines the reformed concepts (as of 1926) of space and time (chapter 2), matter (chapter 3) and biology (chapter 4) and concludes that the close approach to each other of the concepts of matter, life and mind, and the partial overflow of each other's domain, imply that there is a fundamental principle (Holism) of which they are the progressive outcome.&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|86}}  Chapters 5 and 6 provide the general concept, functions and categories of Holism; chapters 7 and 8 address Holism with respect to Mechanism and Darwinism, chapters 9-11 make a start towards demonstrating the concepts and functions of Holism for the metaphysical categories (mind, personality, ideals) and the book concludes with a chapter that argues for the universal ubiquity of Holism and its place as a monistic ontology.

The following is an overview of Smuts' opinions regarding the general concept, functions, and categories of Holism; like the definition of Holism, other than the idea that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, the editor is unaware of any authoritative secondary sources corroborating Smuts' opinions.

=== Structure ===
Wholes are composites which have an internal structure, function or character which clearly differentiate them from mechanical additions, aggregates, and constructions, such as science assumes on the mechanical hypothesis.&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|106}} The concept of structure is not confined to the physical domain (e.g. chemical, biological and artifacts);  it also applies to the metaphysical domain (e.g. mental structures, properties, attributes, values, ideals, etc.)&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|161}}

=== Field ===
The field of a whole is not something different and additional to it, it is the continuation of the whole beyond its sensible contours of experience.&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|113}}  The field characterizes a whole as a unified and synthesised event in the system of Relativity, that includes not only its present but also its past—and also its future potentialities.&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|89}}  As such, the concept of field entails both activity and structure.&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|115}}

=== Variation ===

Darwin's theory of organic descent placed primary emphasis on the role of natural selection, but there would be nothing to select if not for variation.  Variations that are the result of mutations in the biological sense and variations that are the result of individually acquired modifications in the personal sense are attributed by Smuts to Holism; further it was his opinion that because variations appear in complexes and not singly, evolution is more than the outcome of individual selections; it is holistic.&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|190–192}}

=== Regulation ===

The whole exhibits a discernible regulatory function as it relates to cooperation and coordination of the structure and activity of parts, and to the selection and deselection of variations. The result is a balanced correlation of organs and functions. The activities of the parts are directed to central ends; co-operation and unified action instead of the separate mechanical activities of the parts.&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|125}}

=== Creativity ===
It is the intermingling of fields which is creative or causal in nature.  This is seen in matter, where if not for its dynamic structural creative character matter could not have been the mother of the universe.  This function, or factor of creativity is even more marked in biology where the protoplasm of the cell is vitally active in an ongoing process of creative change where parts are continually being destroyed and replaced by new protoplasm. With minds the regulatory function of Holism acquires consciousness and freedom, demonstrating a creative power of the most far-reaching character. Holism is not only creative but self-creative, and its final structures are far more holistic than its initial structures.&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|18, 37, 67–68, 88–89 }}

=== Causality ===
As it relates to causality Smuts makes reference to [[A. N. Whitehead]], and indirectly [[Baruch Spinoza]]; the Whitehead premise is that organic mechanism is a fundamental process which realizes and actualizes individual syntheses or unities.  Holism (the factor) exemplifies this same idea while emphasizing the holistic character of the process.  The whole completely transforms the concept of Causality; results are not directly a function of causes. The whole absorbs and integrates the cause into its own activity; results appear as the consequence of the activity of the whole.&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|121–124,126}}  Note that this material relating to Whitehead's influence as it relates to causality was added in the second edition, and of course will not be found in reprints of the first edition; nor is it included in the most recent Holst edition.  It is the second edition of ''Holism and Evolution'' (1927) that provides the most recent and definitive treatment by Smuts.

=== The whole is greater than the sum of its parts ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;The fundamental holistic characters as a unity of parts which is so close and intense as to be more than the sum of its parts; which not only gives a particular conformation or structure to the parts, but so relates and determines them in their synthesis that their functions are altered;  the synthesis affects and determines the parts, so that they function towards the whole; and the whole and the parts, therefore reciprocally influence and determine each other, and appear more or less to merge their individual characters: the whole is in the parts and the parts are in the whole, and this synthesis of whole and parts is reflected in the holistic character of the functions of the parts as well as of the whole.&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|88}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Progressive grading of wholes ===
A "rough and provisional" summary of the progressive grading of wholes that comprise holism is as follows:&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|109}}

# Material structure e.g. a chemical compound
# Functional structure in living bodies 
# Animals, which exhibit a degree of central control that is primarily implicit and unconscious
# Personality, characterized as conscious central control
# States and similar group organizations characterized by central control that involve many people 
# Holistic Ideals, or absolute Values, distinct from human personality that are creative factors in the creation of a spiritual world, for example Truth, Beauty and Goodness.

==Holism in philosophy==
{{main|Confirmation holism|Semantic holism}}
In philosophy, any doctrine that emphasizes the priority of a whole over its parts is holism. Some suggest that such a definition owes its origins to a non-holistic view of language and places it in the reductivist camp. Alternately, a 'holistic' definition of holism denies the necessity of a division between the function of separate parts and the workings of the 'whole'. Effectively this means that the concept of a part has no absolute foundation in observation, but is rather a result of a materialist structuring of reality based on the necessity of logical and distinct units as a means to deriving information through comparative analysis. It suggests that the key recognizable characteristic of a concept of 'true' holism is a sense of the fundamental truth of any particular experience. This exists in contradistinction to what is perceived as the reductivist reliance on inductive method as the key to verification of its concept of how the parts function within the whole. Equally the potential for recognising the clarity of holistic experience within the logical terms of maths is limited by the abstract nature of numbers. In terms of real life measurements numbers have no scale or dimensional properties, so they have to rely on experimentally verified units (e.g. inches, volts, calories etc.), to describe reality. It is this reliance on the holistic integrity of experience which leads to the recognition that intuitive perception rather than mathematical calculation is the source of the truth of effective theories.  (See references Holism, 2016.)

=== Philosophy of language ===
In the [[philosophy of language]] this becomes the claim, called [[semantic holism]], that the meaning of an individual word or sentence can only be understood in terms of its relations to a larger body of language, even a whole theory or a whole language. In the [[philosophy of mind]], a mental state may be identified only in terms of its relations with others. This is often referred to as "content holism" or "holism of the mental". This notion involves the philosophies of such figures as [[Frege]], [[Wittgenstein]], and [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophybasics.com/branch_holism.html ''Holism'', The Basics of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Epistemological and confirmation holism ===
[[epistemological holism|Epistemological]] and [[confirmation holism]] are mainstream ideas in contemporary philosophy.

=== Ontological holism ===
Ontological holism was espoused by [[David Bohm]] in his theory&lt;ref&gt;Bohm, D. (1980). ''Wholeness and the Implicate Order''. London: Routledge. {{ISBN|0-7100-0971-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[implicate and explicate order]].

=== Spinoza ===
The concept of holism played a pivotal role in [[Baruch Spinoza]]'s philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Huenemann, ''Interpreting Spinoza: Critical Essays'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eccy De Jonge, ''Spinoza and Deep Ecology: Challenging Traditional Approaches to Environmentalism'', UK: Ashgate Publishing, 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;65&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hegel ===
Hegel rejected "the fundamentally atomistic conception of the object," (Stern, 38) arguing that "individual objects exist as manifestations of indivisible substance-universals, which cannot be reduced to a set of properties or attributes; he therefore holds that the object should be treated as an ontologically primary whole." (Stern, 40) In direct opposition to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], therefore, "Hegel insists that the unity we find in our experience of the world is not constructed by us out of a plurality of intuitions." (Stern, 40) In "his ontological scheme a concrete individual is not reducible to a plurality of sensible properties, but rather exemplifies a substance universal." (Stern, 41) His point is that it is "a mistake to treat an organic substance like blood as nothing more than a compound of unchanging chemical elements, that can be separated and united without being fundamentally altered." (Stern, 103) In Hegel's view, a substance like blood is thus "more of an organic unity and cannot be understood as just an external composition of the sort of distinct substances that were discussed at the level of chemistry." (Stern, 103) Thus in Hegel's view, blood is blood and cannot be successfully reduced to what we consider are its component parts; we must view it as a whole substance entire unto itself. This is most certainly a fundamentally holistic view.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediafire.com/?rxmn2t1votf Robert Stern, ''Hegel, Kant and the Structure of the Object'', London: Routledge Chapman Hall, 1990 (full text download)] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160520122904/http://www.mediafire.com/?rxmn2t1votf |date=2016-05-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- [Editors note: work in progress, moving references to Hegel to a common section] [[Hegel]]&lt;ref&gt;Robert Stern, ''Hegel, Kant and the Structure of the Object'', London: Routledge, 1990, p.&amp;nbsp;6 &amp; p.&amp;nbsp;135&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Merold Westphal, ''Hegel, Freedom, and Modernity'', New York: SUNY, 1992, pp.79-81, &amp; p.&amp;nbsp;86&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Edmund Husserl]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Esfield, ''Holism in Philosophy of Mind and Philosophy of Physics'', Springer, 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johanna Maria Tito, ''Logic in the Husserlian Context'', Northwestern University Press, 1990, p.&amp;nbsp;245&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

==Holism in physical sciences==
{{main |Holism in science}}

=== Agriculture ===
There are several newer methods in [[agricultural science]] such as [[permaculture]] and holistic planned grazing ([[holistic management]]) that integrate [[ecology]] and [[social sciences]] with food production. [[Organic farming]] is sometimes considered a holistic approach.

=== Chaos and complexity ===
In the latter half of the 20th century, holism led to [[systems thinking]] and its derivatives. Systems in biology, psychology, or sociology are frequently so complex that their behavior is, or appears, "new" or "[[emergence|emergent]]": it cannot be deduced from the properties of the elements alone.{{Sfn | von Bertalanffy | 1971 | p = 54}}

Holism has thus been used as a catchword. This contributed to the resistance encountered by the scientific interpretation of holism, which insists that there are [[ontology|ontological]] reasons that prevent reductive models in principle from providing efficient algorithms for prediction of system behavior in certain classes of systems.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Scientific holism holds that the behavior of a system cannot be perfectly predicted, no matter how much data is available. Natural systems can produce surprisingly unexpected behavior, and it is suspected that behavior of such systems might be [[computational irreducibility|computationally irreducible]], which means it would not be possible to even approximate the system state without a full simulation of all the events occurring in the system. Key properties of the higher level behavior of certain classes of systems may be mediated by rare "surprises" in the behavior of their elements due to the principle of interconnectivity, thus evading predictions except by brute force simulation.

[[Complex systems|Complexity theory]] (also called "science of complexity") is a contemporary heir of systems thinking. It comprises both computational and holistic, relational approaches towards understanding [[complex adaptive systems]], and especially in the latter, some argue that it can be seen as the polar opposite to reductive methods. General theories of complexity have been proposed, and numerous complexity institutes and departments have sprung up around the world. The [[Santa Fe Institute]] is arguably the most famous of them.

=== Ecology ===
[[File:The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg|240px|thumb|right|The Earth seen from [[Apollo 17]]]]
{{See also|Holistic community}}
Holistic thinking is often applied to ecology, combining biological, chemical, physical, economic, ethical, and political insights. The complexity grows with the area, so that it is necessary to reduce the characteristic of the view in other ways, for example to a specific time of duration.

[[John Muir]], Scots-born early American conservationist,&lt;ref&gt;Reconnecting with John Muir By Terry Gifford, University of Georgia, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; wrote "When we try to pick out anything by itself we find it hitched to everything else in the Universe".

More information is to be found in the field of [[systems ecology]], a cross-disciplinary field influenced by [[general systems theory]].

=== Medicine ===
In [[primary care]] the term "holistic," has been used to describe approaches that take into account social considerations and other intuitive judgements.&lt;ref name="TudorHart2010"&gt;[[Julian Tudor Hart]] (2010) [https://books.google.com/books?id=h5_6-NeAqcsC&amp;pg=PA258 ''The Political Economy of Health Care''] pp.106, 258&lt;/ref&gt; The term holism, and so-called approaches, appear in [[psychosomatic illness|psychosomatic]] medicine in the 1970s, when they were considered one possible way to conceptualize psychosomatic phenomena. Instead of charting one-way causal links from [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]] to [[Soma (biology)|soma]], or vice versa, it aimed at a systemic model, where multiple biological, psychological and social factors were seen as interlinked.&lt;ref name="Lipowski1977"/&gt;

Other, alternative approaches in the 1970s were psychosomatic and somatopsychic approaches, which concentrated on causal links only from psyche to soma, or from soma to psyche, respectively.&lt;ref name="Lipowski1977"&gt;Lipowski, 1977.{{Page needed|date=June 2011}}{{Request quotation|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At present it is commonplace in psychosomatic medicine to state that psyche and soma cannot really be separated for practical or theoretical purposes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} A disturbance on any level—somatic, psychic, or social—will radiate to all the other levels, too. In this sense, psychosomatic thinking is similar to the [[biopsychosocial model]] of medicine.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

Many [[alternative medicine]] practitioners claim a [[Holistic health|holistic approach to healing]].

=== Neurology ===
A lively debate has run since the end of the 19th century regarding the functional organization of the [[brain]]. The holistic tradition (e.g., [[Pierre Marie]]) maintained that the brain was a homogeneous organ with no specific subparts whereas the localizationists (e.g., [[Paul Broca]]) argued that the brain was organized in functionally distinct [[cortical area]]s which were each specialized to process a given type of information or implement specific mental operations. The controversy was [[epitome|epitomized]] with the existence of a [[language]] area in the brain, nowadays known as [[Broca's area]].&lt;ref&gt;'Does Broca's area exist?': Christofredo Jakob's 1906 response to Pierre Marie's holistic stance. Kyrana Tsapkini, Ana B. Vivas, Lazaros C. Triarhou. ''Brain and Language'', Volume 105, Issue 3, June 2008, Pages 211-219 {{DOI|10.1016/j.bandl.2007.07.124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Holism in social sciences==

=== Architecture ===
Architecture is often argued by design academics and those practicing in design to be a holistic enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;Holm, Ivar (2006). ''Ideas and Beliefs in Architecture: How attitudes, orientations, and underlying assumptions shape the built environment''. Oslo School of Architecture and Design. {{ISBN|82-547-0174-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Used in this context, holism tends to imply an all-inclusive design perspective. This trait is considered exclusive to architecture, distinct from other professions involved in design projects.

=== Branding ===
A holistic brand (also holistic branding) is considering the entire brand or image of the company. For example, a universal brand image across all countries, including everything from advertising styles to the stationery the company has made, to the company colours.

=== Economics ===
With roots in [[Schumpeter]], the evolutionary approach might be considered the holistic theory in economics. It shares certain language from the biological evolutionary approach. It takes into account how the [[innovation system]] evolves over time. Knowledge and know-how, know-who, know-what and know-why are part of the whole business economics. Knowledge can also be tacit, as described by [[Michael Polanyi]]. These models are open, and consider that it is hard to predict exactly the impact of a policy measure. They are also less mathematical.

=== Education reform ===
The [[Taxonomy of Educational Objectives]] identifies many levels of cognitive functioning, which can be used to create a more [[holistic education]]. In [[authentic assessment]], rather than using computers to score multiple choice tests, a [[standards based assessment]] uses trained scorers to score open-response items using holistic scoring methods.&lt;ref&gt;Rubrics (Authentic Assessment Toolbox) "So, when might you use a holistic rubric? Holistic rubrics tend to be used when a quick or gross judgment needs to be made." [http://jonathan.mueller.faculty.noctrl.edu/toolbox/rubrics.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; In projects such as the North Carolina Writing Project, scorers are instructed not to count errors, or count numbers of points or supporting statements. The scorer is instead instructed to judge holistically whether "as a whole" is it more a "2" or a "3". Critics question whether such a process can be as objective as computer scoring, and the degree to which such scoring methods can result in different scores from different scorers.

===Psychology===

==== Psychology of perception ====
A major holistic movement in the early twentieth century was [[gestalt psychology]]. The claim was that perception is not an aggregation of atomic [[sense data]] but a field, in which there is a figure and a ground. Background has holistic effects on the perceived figure. Gestalt psychologists included [[Wolfgang Koehler]], [[Max Wertheimer]], and [[Kurt Koffka]]. Koehler claimed the perceptual fields corresponded to electrical fields in the brain. [[Karl Lashley]] did experiments with gold foil pieces inserted in monkey brains purporting to show that such fields did not exist. However, many of the perceptual illusions and visual phenomena exhibited by the gestaltists were taken over (often without credit) by later perceptual psychologists. Gestalt psychology had influence on [[Fritz Perls]]' [[gestalt therapy]], although some old-line gestaltists opposed the association with counter-cultural and [[New Age]] trends later associated with gestalt therapy. Gestalt theory was also influential on phenomenology. [[Aron Gurwitsch]] wrote on the role of the field of consciousness in gestalt theory in relation to phenomenology. [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] made much use of holistic psychologists such as work of [[Kurt Goldstein]] in his ''Phenomenology of Perception''.

==== Teleological psychology ====
[[Alfred Adler]] believed that the individual (an integrated whole expressed through a self-consistent unity of thinking, feeling, and action, moving toward an unconscious, [[Classical Adlerian psychology#Fictional final goal|fictional final goal]]), must be understood within the larger wholes of society, from the groups to which he belongs (starting with his face-to-face relationships), to the larger whole of mankind. The recognition of our social embeddedness and the need for developing an interest in the welfare of others, as well as a respect for nature, is at the heart of Adler's philosophy of living and principles of psychotherapy.

[[Edgar Morin]], the French philosopher and sociologist, can be considered a holist based on the [[Transdisciplinarity|transdisciplinary]] nature of his work.

Mel Levine, M.D., author of ''A Mind at a Time'',&lt;ref&gt;(Simon &amp; Schuster, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; and co-founder (with Charles R. Schwab) of the not-for-profit organization All Kinds of Minds, can be considered a holist based on his view of the 'whole child' as a product of many systems and his work supporting the educational needs of children through the management of a child's educational profile as a whole rather than isolated weaknesses in that profile.

=== Anthropology ===
There is an ongoing dispute as to whether anthropology is intrinsically holistic. Supporters of this concept consider anthropology holistic in two senses. First, it is concerned with all human beings across times and places, and with all dimensions of humanity (evolutionary, biophysical, sociopolitical, economic, cultural, psychological, etc.)  Further, many academic programs following this approach take a "four-field" approach to anthropology that encompasses [[physical anthropology]], [[archeology]], [[linguistics]], and [[cultural anthropology]] or [[social anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Shore | first = Bradd | year = 1999 | title = Strange Fate of Holism | journal = Anthropology News | volume = 40 | issue = 9 | pages = 4–5 | doi = 10.1111/an.1999.40.9.5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some leading anthropologists disagree, and consider anthropological holism to be an artifact from 19th century [[sociocultural evolution|social evolutionary]] thought that inappropriately imposes scientific [[positivism]] upon cultural anthropology.&lt;ref name=Sacred_bundle&gt;{{Citation | editor1-last =Segal | editor1-first = Daniel A | first2 = Ian | editor2-last = Yanagisako | first1 = James | last1 = Clifford | last2 = Hodder | first3 = Rena | last3 = Lederman | first4 = Michael | last4 = Silverstein |title=Unwrapping the Sacred Bundle: Reflections on the Disciplining of Anthropology |publisher=Duke University Press |year= 2005 |url=http://www.dukeupress.edu/cgibin/forwardsql/search.cgi?template0=nomatch.htm&amp;template2=books/book_detail_page.htm&amp;user_id=11016434335&amp;Bmain.Btitle_option=1&amp;Bmain.Btitle=Unwrapping+the+Sacred+Bundle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "holism" is additionally used within social and cultural anthropology to refer to an analysis of a society as a whole which refuses to break society into component parts. One definition says: "as a methodological ideal, holism implies ... that one does not permit oneself to believe that our own established institutional boundaries (e.g. between politics, sexuality, religion, economics) necessarily may be found also in foreign societies."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anthrobase.com/Dic/eng/def/holism.htm anthrobase definition of holism]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Émile Durkheim ====
{{main|Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft}} {{see also|Ubuntu (philosophy)}}
[[Émile Durkheim]] developed a concept of holism which he set as opposite to the notion that a [[society]] was nothing more than a simple collection of individuals. In more recent times, [[Louis Dumont (anthropologist)|Louis Dumont]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Dumont (anthropologist)|Louis Dumont]], 1984&lt;/ref&gt; has contrasted "holism" to "[[individualism]]" as two different forms of societies. According to him, modern humans live in an individualist society, whereas ancient Greek society, for example, could be qualified as "holistic", because the individual found identity in the whole society. Thus, the individual was ready to sacrifice himself or herself for his or her [[community]], as his or her life without the ''[[polis]]'' had no sense whatsoever.

==== Cosmomorphism ====
The French Protestant missionary [[Maurice Leenhardt]] coined the term "cosmomorphism" to indicate the state of perfect [[symbiosis]] with the surrounding environment which characterized the culture of the [[Melanesians]] of [[New Caledonia]]. For these people, an isolated individual is totally indeterminate, indistinct, and featureless until he can find his position within the natural and social world in which he is inserted. The confines between the self and the world are annulled to the point that the material body itself is no guarantee of the sort of recognition of identity which is typical of our own culture.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Bihan, [http://www.lehman.cuny.edu/ile.en.ile/paroles/bihan_writer.html "The Writer, a Man Without Qualities"], ''Literature and Identity in New Caledonia''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Susan Rasmussen, [http://ijds.lemoyne.edu/journal/3_1/pdf/IJDS.3.1.03.Rasmussen.pdf "Personahood, Self, Difference, and Dialogue (Commentary on Chaudhary)"], ''International Journal for Dialogical Science'', Fall 2008, Vol.&amp;nbsp;3, No.&amp;nbsp;1, 31-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theology ===
Holistic concepts are strongly represented within the thoughts expressed within [[Logos]] (per [[Heraclitus]]), [[Panentheism]] and [[Pantheism]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

In [[theological anthropology]], which belongs to theology and not to anthropology, holism is the belief that [[Human body|body]], [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] and [[spirit]] are not separate components of a person, but rather facets of a united whole.&lt;ref&gt;"The traditional anthropology encounters major problems in the Bible and its predominantly holistic view of human beings. Genesis 2:7 is a key verse: 'Then the LORD God formed man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being' (NRSV). The 'living being' (traditionally, 'living soul') is an attempt to translate the Hebrew ''nephesh hayah'', which indicates a 'living person' in the context. More than one interpreter has pointed out that this text does not say that the human being ''has'' a soul but rather ''is'' a soul. H. Wheeler Robinson summarized the matter in his statement that 'The Hebrew conceived man as animated body and not as an incarnate soul.'" (Martin E. Tate, "The Comprehensive Nature of Salvation in Biblical Perspective," ''Evangelical review of theology'', Vol. 23.)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1962">'''Johannes''' was the second [[Archbishop of Uppsala]], [[Sweden]], with a short-lived reign between 1185 and 1187.

==Biography==
His name is sometimes spelled as 'Johan', the Swedish form of 'Johannes', but since the [[Swedish language]] had yet to be established it is of little importance. Little is known about Johannes. Only a few months after the death of the first Archbishop [[Stefan (archbishop of Uppsala)|Stefan]], Johannes was selected by the Pope to be his successor. He was ordained by the [[Archbishop of Lund]], [[Absalon]]—the [[primate (bishop)|primate]] over the newly established Swedish [[archbishopric]]—by November 1185.

Johennes was killed during [[pillage of Sigtuna]] in 1187 by pagan raiders (possibly [[Estonians]], [[Curonians]] or/and [[Karelians]]).&lt;ref name=Tarvel&gt;Enn Tarvel (2007). [http://haridus.opleht.ee/Arhiiv/7_82007/38-41.pdf ''Sigtuna hukkumine.] Haridus, 2007 (7-8), p 38–41&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1187, a ship from the not yet christianed [[Estonia]] entered [[Mälaren]], a lake close to Uppsala, on a plundering expedition. It sailed to [[Sigtuna]], a prosperous city at that time, and plundered it. On its way back, barricades had been set up at [[Almarestäket]], the only exit point and the place where Johannes was currently residing, to prevent the ship from escaping. The ship was however able to get around the barricades through a creek. There followed a battle, and during the battle Johannes was killed.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The initial plan was to blow up Obote's plane at the [[Entebbe International Airport]] on 24 January 1971, but Butabika's wife informed her brother-in-law Ahmad Oduka, Senior Superintendent of Police, of the plot. He was supposed to be among those on the plane, and his sister-in-law urged him to stay at home on that day to save his life. Oduka, however, was loyal to the government and informed Minister of Internal Affairs Basil Bataringaya. Though the assassination of Obote was prevented, the putschists still managed to launch a [[1971 Ugandan coup d'état|coup d'état on 25 January 1971]]. They overthrew the government,&lt;ref name="saving"/&gt; but then became unsure about the further course of action. Amin was initially reluctant to assume the presidency, whereupon Butabika reportedly threatened him at gunpoint to accept his appointment as [[President of Uganda]].&lt;ref name="father"/&gt; Meanwhile, Butabika's wife had fled the capital out of fear that her informing Oduka of the putschists' plan would have repercussions.&lt;ref name="saving"/&gt;

Soon after the coup, Butabika was involved in the kidnapping and murder of two [[United States]] citizens around July 1971, namely journalist Nicholas Stroh and [[Makerere University]] lecturer Robert Siedle. The two had tried to gather information on unrest and mutinies that had broken out among some Ugandan military units as result of Amin's seizure of power.{{sfnp|Amnesty International|1978|pp=15–16}}&lt;ref name="jailer"&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1975/09/07/archives/the-jailer-as-seen-by-his-exprisoner.html | title = THE JAILER AS SEEN BY HIS EXPRISONER | date = 7 September 1975 |author=Denis Hills |authorlink=Denis Hills | work = [[The New York Times]] | access-date = 24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Career under the Amin regime ===
{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote="Juma Ali was not an easy person to deal with. He was a very temperamental, impatient, rude, irritable and unpredictable man with a chip on his shoulder whose character bordered on insanity and sadism. People nicknamed him 'Butabika' because his mental state was indistinguishable from those of the mental patients at Butabika hospital."|source=[[Gordon Wavamunno]]'s description of Butabika{{sfnp|Wavamunno|2000|p=161}} }}

Butabika became one of leading military figures under the new regime.&lt;ref name="fall"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.monitor.co.ug/Magazines/PeoplePower/How-Mbarara--Kampala-fell-to-Tanzanian-army/689844-2294842-i5lpda/index.html| title = How Mbarara, Kampala fell to Tanzanian army| date = 27 April 2014| website = Daily Monitor| access-date = 6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, he was widely considered insane in Uganda, even by his own colleagues in the military.{{sfnp|Allen|1987|p=129}} He was notorious for his eccentric,&lt;ref name="elite"/&gt; "erratic"&lt;ref name="causes"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.monitor.co.ug/SpecialReports/Amin/859112-860028-qexfmyz/index.html | title = 30 years after the fall of Amin, causes of 1979 war revealed | date = 11 April 2009 | website = Daily Monitor| access-date = 14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and excessive behavior, including extreme brutality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.monitor.co.ug/OpEd/columnists/AllanTacca/The-ideological-direction-of-NRM-MPs-is-fascism/878694-1943240-w1xua/index.html | title = The ideological direction of NRM MPs is fascism | author = Alan Tacca | website = Daily Monitor | date = 11 August 2013 | access-date = 14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[George Ivan Smith]], Butabika believed himself to be a "demi-god" as the government allowed him to kill and torture at will,{{sfnp|Smith|1980|p=120}} while Peter Jeremy Allen described him as "merciless psychopathic killer" of "low mentality".{{sfnp|Allen|1987|p=129}} Similarly, businessman [[Gordon Wavamunno]] had a very negative opinion of Butabika, and regarded him as one of those who "were intoxicated with unlimited and irresponsible power, and did not hesitate to abuse it at the slightest opportunity or excuse."{{sfnp|Wavamunno|2000|p=160}} The nickname by which he is best known stemmed from his extreme behavior: "Butabika" is the name of a prominent psychiatric clinic near [[Kampala]],{{sfnp|Smith|1980|p=120}}&lt;ref name="elite"/&gt;{{sfnp|Otunnu|2016|pp=292–293}} and a byword for people with a mental illness in Uganda.{{sfnp|Smith|1980|p=120}}{{sfnp|Allen|1987|p=129}}

Promoted to [[lieutenant colonel]],{{efn|name=rank|Though most sources report that Butabika was [[lieutenant colonel]] during Amin's dictatorship,&lt;ref name="missed"/&gt;&lt;ref name="elite"/&gt; others, including Colonel Abdu Kisuule, have stated that he was a [[general]].{{sfnp|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=24}}&lt;ref name="won"/&gt; Either way, promotions "were issued randomly" under Amin's regime and mattered little compared to one's direct connection to the president.{{sfnp|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=61}} }} Butabika served as commander of "elite" units that were regarded as especially loyal to Amin, including the Chui Regiment&lt;ref name="elite"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/oped/434748-1137972-yudf18/index.html | title = Elite troops turn paper tigers again as Gaddafi's Touaregs melt into the sands | author = Frederick Golooba-Mutebi | website = [[The EastAfrican]] | date = 4 April 2011 | access-date = 14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Malire Mechanised Specialist Reconnaissance Regiment.&lt;ref name="Arube"/&gt;{{sfnp|Kato|1989|p=106}}&lt;ref name="burning"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.monitor.co.ug/Magazines/PeoplePower/Pilot-Omita-MiG21-AminTanzania-Juma-Butabika/689844-4129682-lwlpbkz/index.html | title = Pilot Omita parachutes out of burning MiG-21 | date = 9 October 2017 | website = Daily Monitor | access-date = 14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As time went on, elements in the military grew dissatisfied with Amin's regime. [[Brigadier]] [[Charles Arube]] was among those who felt sidelined, and organised a meeting of high-ranking commanders in March 1974. Butabika was present, and offered Arube his help in cases where he felt ignored by the president.&lt;ref name="Arube"/&gt; Soon after, Arube attempted to oust Amin in a coup d'état. The Malire Mechanised Specialist Reconnaissance Regiment mutinied and joined the coup, but Butabika stayed loyal to Amin.{{sfnp|Mwakikagile|2012|pp=57–58}} In the end, Arube's coup failed.&lt;ref name="Arube"/&gt;{{sfnp|Mwakikagile|2012|pp=57–58}}

Despite his extremely limited education, Butabika was also appointed as chairman of the "Military Tribunal" in 1973.{{sfnp|Amnesty International|1978|pp=4, ERRATA}}{{sfnp|Otunnu|2016|pp=292–293}} The Military Tribunal had been set up by Amin to circumvent regular courts and enforce his decisions;{{sfnp|Ellett|2013|p=78}} it thus had the reputation to "rubber-stamp[ ] Amin's death sentences".{{sfnp|Kato|1989|p=106}} According to [[Amnesty International]], the tribunals Butabika chaired were ''de facto'' [[kangaroo court]]s and passed judgements without regard to laws or proper procedure.{{sfnp|Amnesty International|1978|pp=4, ERRATA}} Most prominently, he acquitted several senior military figures who were accused of involvement in the [[forced disappearance]] of 18 prominent Ugandans.{{sfnp|Amnesty International|1978|pp=15–16}} In contrast, Butabika passed extremely harsh judgements where opponents to the regime were concerned, earning a reputation as "one of Amin's chief executioners".{{sfnp|Allen|1987|p=129}} He sentenced [[British people|British]] author [[Denis Hills]] to death in 1975 for calling Amin a "village tyrant",&lt;ref name="jailer"/&gt;{{sfnp|Keesing's Record|1975|p=2}} while one of his trials in 1977 was described as "travesty of justice, a 'show', since the conventions and pleas of guilt were obtained by force from the accused".{{sfnp|Ellett|2013|p=78}} He did, however, acquit Wod Okello Lawoko, senior manager of [[Radio Uganda]], after the latter had fallen out of favor with Amin and been arrested on charges of treason.&lt;ref name="real"/&gt; Though Butabika was once dismissed as chairman on one tribunal for misconduct, namely [[corruption]] in late 1976, he was later reinstated.{{sfnp|Amnesty International|1978|pp=4, ERRATA}}

=== Uganda–Tanzania War and death ===
By 1978, hostilities had greatly increased between Uganda and the neighboring state of [[Tanzania]], with reports surfacing of invasion plans by the [[Tanzania People's Defence Force]]. Butabika was among the proponents of a preemptive strike against Tanzania,{{sfnp|Mwakikagile|2010|p=319}}&lt;ref name="lies"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.monitor.co.ug/SpecialReports/ugandaat50/Lies-drove-Amin-to-strike-Tanzania/1370466-1628176-14f9t0qz/index.html | title = Lies drove Amin to strike Tanzania | date = 25 November 2012 | website = Daily Monitor| access-date = 14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though several other leading Ugandan officers believed that their military was not ready for a conflict with Tanzania.&lt;ref name="won"&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.thecitizen.co.tz/News/Why-Tanzania-defeated-Amin/1840340-2331220-14wrliyz/index.html | title = Amin's former top soldier reveals why TPDF won | author = Henry Lubega | website = The Citizen | date = 30 May 2014 | access-date = 14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The situation escalated on 9 October 1978,&lt;ref name="burning"/&gt; when an altercation broke out between an Ugandan soldier and Tanzanian border guards. One of Amin's close advisors, Colonel Abdu Kisuule, later claimed that the entire incident had been orchestrated by Butabika to gain "favors and cheap popularity" from the president.&lt;ref name="won"/&gt;{{sfnp|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=24}} According to this version, the Ugandan soldier who caused the altercation had been Butabika's brother-in-law, and his death in a shootout with Tanzanians caused Butabika to seek revenge.&lt;ref name="causes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="won"/&gt; Others however report that the exact identity of the Ugandan soldier remains unknown, and that Butabika was lied to by his subordinates about the course of events; in that case, it is possible that he actually believed that Tanzanian border guards had initiated hostilities.&lt;ref name="burning"/&gt;{{sfnp|Mwakikagile|2010|p=319}} 

In any case, Butabika consequently ordered an unauthorized attack on [[Tanzania]], resulting in the outbreak of the [[Uganda–Tanzania War]].{{sfnp|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=24}} His forces easily overran the Tanzanian troops stationed at [[Mutukula, Tanzania|Mutukula]] and [[Minziro Forest Reserve|Minziro]], whereupon he telephoned Amin, claiming that Tanzania had launched an attack and that he had responded with a counter-attack. The president had already been eager to annex Tanzanian territory, and allowed the invasion to proceed. Reinforced by other UPDF detachments, Butabika occupied the entire Kagera salient (northern [[Kagera Region]]) until stopping at [[Kyaka Bridge]], which was destroyed. The UPDF troops proceeded to celebrate while looting, raping and murdering in the occupied area.&lt;ref name="burning"/&gt;{{sfnp|Mwakikagile|2010|p=319}}&lt;ref name="won"/&gt;

The Tanzanian military quickly regrouped, causing the UPDF to retreat back into Uganda even as President Amin declared Kagera's annexation.&lt;ref name="won"/&gt; The Tanzanians launched a large counter-offensive, and the Ugandan military soon started to disintegrate under the onslaught.&lt;ref name="missed"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fall"/&gt; By the time the Ugandan border town [[Mutukula, Uganda|Mutukula]] fell to the Tanzanian army in January 1979, Butabika was back in Kampala and prepared the celebrations for the 8th anniversary of Amin's rule. The lieutenant colonel took part in a parade at [[Kololo]] on 25 January, where he and other high-ranking commanders performed a traditional Nubian dance. One Ugandan later commented that when he saw the dancing officers on live television, he realised that his country's leadership "did not know what exactly was going on" in regard to the war.&lt;ref name="lies"/&gt; On 9 April, the Tanzanian forces and their [[Uganda National Liberation Front|UNLF]] allies [[Fall of Kampala|entered Uganda's capital Kampala]], encountering only light resistance. Butabika was one of the few leading Ugandan commanders who stayed in the city, and he was killed in a firefight with Tanzanian soldiers of the 205th and 208th Brigades in the [[Bwaise]]-[[Kawempe]] area as they attempted to secure the northern section of the city on 11 April.&lt;ref name="fall"/&gt;{{sfnp|Smith|1980|p=120}}

== Personal life ==
Butabika was a [[Islam|Muslim]],{{sfnp|Smith|1980|p=131}}{{sfnp|Kato|1989|p=106}} though he also believed in [[African magic|magic]].&lt;ref name="won"/&gt; One observer described him as "short and small [...] bully" who enjoyed challenging "far more strongly-built men" for fights.{{sfnp|Kato|1989|p=106}} He was married to an Ugandan woman of the [[List of tribes in Uganda|Baziba tribe]].&lt;ref name="causes"/&gt;

During an interview, Page recalled his childhood, noting that his house "was usually a mess, with computers, science, and technology magazines and ''[[Popular Science]]'' magazines all over the place", an environment in which he immersed himself. Page was an avid reader during his youth, writing in his 2013 Google founders letter: "I remember spending a huge amount of time pouring [sic] over books and magazines".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Larry Page|title=2013 Founders' Letter|url=https://investor.google.com/corporate/2013/founders-letter.html|website=Google Investor Relations|publisher=Google|accessdate=February 2, 2015|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to writer Nicholas Carlson, the combined influence of Page's home atmosphere and his attentive parents "fostered creativity and invention". Page also played [[flute]] and studied [[music composition]] while growing up. He attended the renowned music summer camp -  [[Interlochen Arts Camp]] at Interlochen, Michigan.  Page has mentioned that his musical education inspired his impatience and obsession with speed in computing. "In some sense, I feel like music training led to the high-speed legacy of Google for me". In an interview Page said that "In music, you're very cognizant of time. Time is like the primary thing" and that "If you think about it from a music point of view, if you're a [[percussionist]], you hit something, it's got to happen in [[milliseconds]], fractions of a second".&lt;ref name="Car" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fortune.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2014/11/18/larry-page-music-education/|title=How music education influenced Google CEO Larry Page|first=Miguel|last=Helft|work=Fortune|date=Nov 18, 2014|publisher=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Page was first attracted to computers when he was six years old, as he was able to "play with the stuff lying around"—first-generation personal computers—that had been left by his parents.&lt;ref name="achievement.org"/&gt; He became the "first kid in his elementary school to turn in an assignment from a [[word processor]]".&lt;ref name=Scott/&gt; His older brother also taught him to take things apart and before long he was taking "everything in his house apart to see how it worked". He said that "from a very early age, I also realized I wanted to invent things. So I became really interested in technology and business. Probably from when I was 12, I knew I was going to start a company eventually."&lt;ref name= Scott&gt;{{cite book |last=Scott|first={{nobr|Virginia A.}}|date=October 30, 2008|orig-year=First published in 2008|title=Google / Virginia Scott|series=Corporations That Changed the World|location=Westport, Connecticut; London|publisher=Greenwood Press |page=2|isbn=978-0313351273 |issn=1939-2486|lccn=2008030541|oclc=234146408|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Page attended the Okemos [[Montessori]] School (now called Montessori Radmoor) in [[Okemos, Michigan|Okemos]], Michigan, from 1975 to 1979, and graduated from [[East Lansing High School]] in 1991. He attended [[Interlochen Center for the Arts]] as a saxophonist for two summers while in high school.

== PhD studies and research ==

After enrolling in a [[computer science]] [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] program at [[Stanford University]], Page was in search of a [[dissertation]] theme and considered exploring the mathematical properties of the [[World Wide Web]], understanding its link structure as a huge [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]. His supervisor, [[Terry Winograd]], encouraged him to pursue the idea, and Page recalled in 2008 that it was the best advice he had ever received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The best advice I ever got|url=http://archive.fortune.com/galleries/2008/fortune/0804/gallery.bestadvice.fortune/2.html|website=Fortune|publisher=Time Inc|accessdate=February 2, 2015|date=April 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also considered doing research on [[telepresence]] and [[autonomous cars]] during this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google Faculty Summit 2009: Meet Google Founder Larry Page|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUNqsYUVPQY|website=GoogleTechTalks on YouTube|publisher=Google|accessdate=February 2, 2015|format=Video upload|date=October 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="doi10.1016/S0169-75529800110-X"&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Brin | first1 = Sergey| authorlink1 = Sergey Brin| last2 = Page | first2 = Lawrence| authorlink2 = Larry Page| doi = 10.1016/S0169-7552(98)00110-X | title = The anatomy of a large-scale hypertextual Web search engine | journal = Computer Networks and ISDN Systems | volume = 30 |issue=1|pages = 107–117 |location=[Amsterdam]|publisher=Elsevier Science Publishers|date=April 1998|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016975529800110X/pdf?md5=55915a8a2d48367394270d7212c3d5fe&amp;pid=1-s2.0-S016975529800110X-main.pdf|format=PDF| issn = 0169-7552|lccn=86641126|oclc=884480703}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brin|first=Sergey| authorlink1 = Sergey Brin|last2=Page| authorlink2 = Larry Page|first2=Lawrence|title=Reprint of: The anatomy of a large-scale hypertextual web search engine|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128612003611|format=PDF|journal=Computer Networks|location=Amsterdam, Netherlands|publisher=Elsiver|date=December 17, 2012|volume=56|issue=18|pages=3825–3833|issn=1389-1286|doi=10.1016/j.comnet.2012.10.007|url-access=subscription|lccn=sn99047167|oclc=610365057}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wiredbirth"/&gt;

Page focused on the problem of finding out which web pages linked to a given page, considering the number and nature of such backlinks as valuable information for that page. The role of [[citation]]s in [[academic publishing]] would also become pertinent for the research.&lt;ref name="wiredbirth"&gt;{{cite web|author1=John Battelle|title=The Birth of Google|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.08/battelle.html?tw=wn_tophead_4|website=Wired|publisher=Condé Nast Digital|accessdate=February 22, 2015|date=August 13, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sergey Brin]], a fellow Stanford PhD [[student]], would soon join Page's research project, nicknamed "[[BackRub]]."&lt;ref name="wiredbirth"/&gt; Together, the pair authored a research paper titled "The Anatomy of a Large-Scale [[Hypertext]]ual Web Search Engine", which became one of the most downloaded scientific documents in the history of the Internet at the time.&lt;ref name="achievement.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="doi10.1016/S0169-75529800110-X"/&gt;

[[John Battelle]], co-founder of ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine, wrote that Page had reasoned that the:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...  entire Web was loosely based on the premise of citation—after all, what is a link but a citation? If he could devise a method to count and qualify each backlink on the Web, as Page puts it "the Web would become a more valuable place."&lt;ref name="wiredbirth"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Battelle further described how Page and Brin began working together on the project:

{{quote|At the time Page conceived of BackRub, the Web comprised an estimated 10 million documents, with an untold number of links between them. The computing resources required to crawl such a beast were well beyond the usual bounds of a student project. Unaware of exactly what he was getting into, Page began building out his crawler. The idea's complexity and scale lured Brin to the job. A [[polymath]] who had jumped from project to project without settling on a thesis topic, he found the premise behind BackRub fascinating. "I talked to lots of research groups" around the school, Brin recalls, "and this was the most exciting project, both because it tackled the Web, which represents human knowledge, and because I liked Larry."&lt;ref name=wiredbirth/&gt;}}

=== Search engine development ===
To convert the backlink data gathered by BackRub's [[web crawler]] into a measure of importance for a given web page, Brin and Page developed the PageRank algorithm, and realized that it could be used to build a [[search engine]] far superior to existing ones.&lt;ref name="wiredbirth" /&gt; The algorithm relied on a new technology that analyzed the relevance of the [[backlink]]s that connected one web page to another.&lt;ref name="Moschovitis"&gt;Moschovitis Group. ''The Internet: A Historical Encyclopedia'', ABC-CLIO, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Combining their ideas, the pair began utilizing Page's dormitory room as a machine laboratory, and extracted spare parts from inexpensive computers to create a device that they used to connect the not nascent search engine with Stanford's broadband campus network.&lt;ref name="wiredbirth"/&gt; After filling Page's room with equipment, they then converted Brin's dorm room into an office and programming center, where they tested their new search engine designs on the Web. The rapid growth of their project caused Stanford's computing infrastructure to experience problems.&lt;ref name="economist.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Enlightenment man|url=http://www.economist.com/node/12673407|website=The Economist|publisher=The Economist Newspaper Limited|accessdate=February 2, 2015|date=December 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Page and Brin used the former's basic [[HTML]] programming skills to set up a simple search page for users, as they did not have a web page developer to create anything visually elaborate. They also began using any computer part they could find to assemble the necessary computing power to handle searches by multiple users. As their search engine grew in popularity among Stanford users, it required additional [[server (computing)|server]]s to process the queries. In August 1996, the initial version of Google, still on the Stanford University website, was made available to Internet users.&lt;ref name="wiredbirth" /&gt;[[File:Page+brin by origa.jpg|thumb|177x177px|Page and [[Sergey Brin]] by [[Graziano Origa]] ]]By early 1997, the BackRub page described the state as follows:

BackRub already exhibited the rudimentary functions and characteristics of a search engine: a query input was entered and it provided a list of backlinks ranked by importance. Page recalled: "We realized that we had a querying tool. It gave you a good overall ranking of pages and ordering of follow-up pages."&lt;ref name="archive.wired.com"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/13.08/battelle.html?pg=2&amp;topic=battelle&amp;topic_set= |title = Wired 13.08: The Birth of Google |website = wired.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Page said that in mid-1998 they finally realized the further potential of their project: "Pretty soon, we had 10,000 searches a day. And we figured, maybe this is really real."&lt;ref name="economist.com" /&gt;

Some compared Page and Brin's vision to the impact of [[Johannes Gutenberg]], the inventor of modern [[printing]]:

{{quote|In 1440, Johannes Gutenberg introduced Europe to the mechanical printing press, printing Bibles for mass consumption. The technology allowed for books and manuscripts&amp;nbsp;– originally replicated by hand&amp;nbsp;– to be printed at a much faster rate, thus spreading knowledge and helping to usher in the European Renaissance&amp;nbsp;... Google has done a similar job.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.librarystuff.net/2009/10/01/google-the-gutenberg/ "Google the Gutenberg"]. ''Information Technology''. October 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The comparison was also noted by the authors of ''The Google Story'': "Not since Gutenberg&amp;nbsp;... has any new invention empowered individuals, and transformed access to information, as profoundly as Google."&lt;ref name=Vise&gt;[[Vise, David]], and [[Malseed, Mark]]. ''[[The Google Story]]'', Delta Publ. (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Also, not long after the two "cooked up their new engine for web searches, they began thinking about information that was at the time beyond the web," such as digitizing books and expanding health information.&lt;ref name="economist.com"/&gt;

==== Founding ====
Mark Malseed wrote in a 2003 [[feature story]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Soliciting funds from faculty members, family and friends, Brin and Page scraped together enough to buy some servers and rent that famous garage in [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]]. ... [soon after], [[Sun Microsystems]] co-founder [[Andy Bechtolsheim]] wrote a $100,000 check to "Google, Inc." The only problem was, "Google, Inc." did not yet exist—the company hadn't yet been incorporated. For two weeks, as they handled the paperwork, the young men had nowhere to deposit the money.&lt;ref name="Moment"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Malseed|first=Mark|date=February 2007|title=The Story of Sergey Brin|journal=[[Moment Magazine]]|url=http://www.oldsite.momentmag.net/moment/issues/2007/02/200702-BrinFeature.html| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130121055147/http://www.oldsite.momentmag.net/moment/issues/2007/02/200702-BrinFeature.html| archivedate=January 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1998,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.google.ca/about/company/history/&lt;/ref&gt; Brin and Page incorporated Google, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.google.com/corporate/execs.html#larry| title = Larry Page Profile | publisher = Google }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the initial domain name of "[[Googol]]," derived from a number that consists of one followed by one hundred zeros—representing the vast amount of data that the search engine was intended to explore. Following inception, Page appointed himself as CEO, while Brin, named Google's co-founder, served as Google's president.&lt;ref name="Car"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Nicholas Carlson|title=The Untold Story Of Larry Page's Incredible Comeback|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/larry-page-the-untold-story-2014-4?page=2|website=Business Insider|publisher=Business Insider, Inc|accessdate=February 2, 2015|date=April 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer Nicholas Carlson wrote in 2014:

&lt;blockquote&gt;While Google is often thought of as the invention of two young computer whizzes—Sergey and Larry, Larry and Sergey—the truth is that Google is a creation of Larry Page, helped along by Sergey Brin.&lt;ref name="Car" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The pair's mission was "to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful."&lt;ref name="Sam"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Samuel Gibbs|title=Google has 'outgrown' its 14-year old mission statement, says Larry Page|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/03/larry-page-google-dont-be-evil-sergey-brin|accessdate=February 2, 2015|work=The Guardian|date=November 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a [[United States dollar|US$]]1-million loan from friends and family, the inaugural team moved into a Mountain View office by the start of 2000. In 1999, Page experimented with smaller servers so Google could fit more into each square meter of the third-party warehouses the company rented for their servers. This eventually led to a search engine that ran much faster than Google's competitors at the time.&lt;ref name="Car" /&gt;

By June 2000, Google had indexed one billion Internet URLs ([[Uniform Resource Locators]]), making it the most comprehensive search engine on the Web at the time. The company cited [[NEC]] Research Institute data in its June 26 press release, stating that "there are more than 1 billion web pages online today," with Google "providing access to 560 million full-text indexed web pages and 500 million partially indexed URLs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google Launches World's Largest Search Engine|url=http://googlepress.blogspot.com/2000/06/google-launches-worlds-largest-search.html|website=News From Google|publisher=Google|accessdate=February 2, 2015|date=June 26, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Early management style ====
During his first tenure as CEO, Page embarked on an attempt to fire all of Google's project managers in 2001. Page's plan involved all of Google's engineers reporting to a VP of engineering, who would then report directly to him—Page explained that he didn't like non-engineers supervising engineers due to their limited technical knowledge.&lt;ref name="Car" /&gt; Page even documented his management tenets for his team to use as a reference:

* Don't delegate: Do everything you can yourself to make things go faster.
* Don't get in the way if you're not adding value. Let the people actually doing the work talk to each other while you go do something else.
* Don't be a [[bureaucrat]].
* Ideas are more important than age. Just because someone is junior doesn't mean they don't deserve respect and cooperation.
* The worst thing you can do is stop someone from doing something by saying, "No. Period." If you say no, you have to help them find a better way to get it done.&lt;ref name="Car" /&gt;

Even though Page's new model was unsustainable and led to disgruntlement among the affected employees, his issue with engineers being managed by non-engineering staff gained traction more broadly. Eventually, the practice of only instating engineers into the management roles of engineering teams was established as a standard across [[Silicon Valley]].&lt;ref name="Max" /&gt;

Page also believed that the faster Google's search engine returned answers, the more it would be used. He fretted over [[milliseconds]] and pushed his engineers—from those who developed [[algorithm]]s to those who built [[data center]]s—to think about [[lag|lag times]]. He also pushed for keeping Google's home page famously sparse in its design because it would help the search results load faster.&lt;ref name="fortune.com"/&gt;

Before Silicon Valley's two most prominent investors, [[Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers]] and [[Sequoia Capital]], agreed to invest a combined total of $50 million in Google, they applied pressure on Page to step down as CEO so that a more experienced leader could build a "world-class management team." Page eventually became amenable to the idea after meeting with other technology CEOs, including [[Steve Jobs]] and Intel's [[Andrew Grove]]. [[Eric Schmidt]], who had been hired as Chairman of Google in March 2001, left his full-time position as the CEO of [[Novell]] to take the same role at Google in August of the same year, and Page moved aside to assume the President of Products role.&lt;ref name="Car" /&gt;

Under Schmidt's leadership, Google underwent a period of major growth and expansion, which included its [[initial public offering]] (IPO) on August 20, 2004. He always acted in consultation with Page and Brin when he embarked on initiatives such as the hiring of an executive team and the creation of a [[sales force management system]]. Page remained the boss at Google in the eyes of the employees, as he gave final approval on all new hires, and it was Page who provided the signature for the IPO, the latter making him a billionaire at the age of 30.&lt;ref name="Car" /&gt;

Page led the acquisition of [[Android (operating system)|Android]] for $50 million in 2005 to fulfill his ambition to place handheld computers in the possession of consumers so that they could access Google anywhere. The purchase was made without Schmidt's knowledge, but the CEO was not perturbed by the relatively small acquisition. Page became passionate about Android, and spent large amounts of time with Android CEO and cofounder [[Andy Rubin]]. By September 2008, [[T-Mobile]] launched the G1, the first phone using Android software and, by 2010, 17.2% of the handset market consisted of Android sales, overtaking Apple for the first time. Android became the world's most popular mobile operating system shortly afterward.&lt;ref name="Car" /&gt;

==== Assumption of CEO position at Google ====
Following a January 2011 announcement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704881304576094340081291776?mod=googlenews_wsj | title = Google's Page to Replace Schmidt as CEO | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Amir | last=Efrati | date=January 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Page officially became the chief executive of Google on April 4, 2011, while Schmidt stepped down to become executive chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/about/company/facts/management/#section-board |title=Management team – Company – Google |publisher=Google.com |accessdate=September 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, Google had over $180 billion market capitalization and more than 24,000 employees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maintour.com/meritbadge/american_business.htm American Business BSA Merit Badge Guide], June 22, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Schmidt announced the end of his tenure as CEO on January 20, 2011, he jokingly tweeted on [[Twitter]]: "Adult-supervision no longer needed." [[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]] organizational management reporter, Max Nisen, described the decade prior to Page's second appointment as Google's CEO as his "lost decade." While Page continued to exert a significant influence at Google during this time, overseeing product development and other operations, he became increasingly disconnected and less responsive over time.&lt;ref name="Car" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Max"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Max Nisen|title=Larry Page's lost decade was the best thing to ever happen to Google|url=http://qz.com/202710/larry-pages-lost-decade-was-the-best-thing-to-ever-happen-to-google/|accessdate=February 6, 2015|work=Quartz|date=April 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2011–2013 ===
As Google's new CEO, Page's two key goals were the development of greater autonomy for the executives overseeing the most important divisions, and higher levels of collaboration, communication and unity among the teams. Page also formed what the media called the "L-Team," a group of senior vice-presidents who reported directly to him and worked in close proximity to his office for a portion of the working week.&lt;ref name="Owe"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Owen Thomas|title=There's A Pretty Big Tension In How Larry Page Is Running Google|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-larry-page-is-running-google-2013-3?IR=T|website=Business Insider|publisher=Business Insider Inc|accessdate=February 1, 2015|date=March 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, he reorganized the company's senior management, placing a CEO-like manager at the top of Google's most important product divisions, including [[YouTube]], [[AdWords]], and [[Google Search]].&lt;ref name="Car" /&gt;

In accordance with a more cohesive team environment, Page declared a new "zero tolerance for fighting" policy that contrasted with his approach during the early days of Google, when he would use his harsh and intense arguments with Brin as an exemplar for senior management. Page had changed his thinking during his time away from the CEO role, as he eventually arrived at the conclusion that his greatly ambitious goals required a harmonious team dynamic. As part of Page's collaborative rejuvenation process, Google's products and applications were consolidated and underwent an [[aesthetic]] overhaul.&lt;ref name="Max" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Die" /&gt;

==== Changes and consolidation process ====
At least 70 of Google's products, features and services were eventually shut down by March 2013, while the appearance and nature of the remaining ones were unified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Urs Hölzle|title=A second spring of cleaning|url=http://googleblog.blogspot.se/2013/03/a-second-spring-of-cleaning.html|website=Official Google Blog|publisher=Google|accessdate=February 3, 2015|date=March 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hel" /&gt; Jon Wiley, lead designer of Google Search at the time, codenamed Page's redesign overhaul, which officially commenced on April 4, 2011, "Project Kennedy," based on Page's use of the term "moonshots" to describe ambitious projects in a January 2013 ''[[Wired magazine|Wired]]'' interview.&lt;ref name="Die"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Dieter Bohn, Ellis Hamburger|title=Redesigning Google: how Larry Page engineered a beautiful revolution|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/1/24/3904134/google-redesign-how-larry-page-engineered-beautiful-revolution|website=The Verge|publisher=[[Vox Media, Inc]]|accessdate=February 1, 2015|date=January 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lev"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Steven Levy|title=Google's Larry Page on Why Moon Shots Matter|url=https://www.wired.com/2013/01/ff-qa-larry-page/all/|website=Wired|publisher=Condé Nast|accessdate=February 1, 2015|date=January 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An initiative named "Kanna" previously attempted to create a uniform design aesthetic for Google's range of products, but it was too difficult at that point in the company's history for one team to drive such change. Matias Duarte, senior director of the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] user experience at the time that "Kennedy" started, explained in 2013 that "Google passionately cares about design." Page proceeded to consult with the Google Creative Lab design team, based in New York City, to find an answer to his question of what a "cohesive vision" of Google might look like.&lt;ref name="Die" /&gt;

The eventual results of "Kennedy," which were progressively rolled out from June 2011 until January 2013, were described by [[The Verge]] technology publication as focused upon "refinement, white space, cleanliness, elasticity, usefulness, and most of all simplicity." The final products were aligned with Page's aim for a consistent suite of products that can "move fast," and "Kennedy" was called a "design revolution" by Duarte. Page's "UXA" (user/graphics interface) design team then emerged from the "Kennedy" project, tasked with "designing and developing a true [[User interface|UI]] framework that transforms Google's [[application software]] into a beautiful, mature, accessible and consistent platform for its users." Unspoken of in public, the small UXA unit was designed to ensure that "Kennedy" became an "institution."&lt;ref name="Die" /&gt;

==== Acquisition strategy and new products ====
When acquiring products and companies for Google, Page asked whether the [[business acquisition]] passed the toothbrush test as an initial qualifier, asking the question "Is it something you will use once or twice a day, and does it make your life better?". This approach looked for usefulness above profitability, and long-term potential over near-term financial gain, which has been noted as rare in business acquiring processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.inc.com/larry-kim/how-google-s-ceo-only-buys-companies-that-pass-his-crazy-toothbrush-test.html |title=Why Google's Larry Page Only Buys Companies That Pass His Crazy Toothbrush Test - Inc.com |website = Inc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/08/17/in-silicon-valley-mergers-must-meet-the-toothbrush-test/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=1 |title =

With [[Facebook]]'s influence rapidly expanding during the start of Page's second tenure, he finally responded to the intensive competition with Google's own social network, [[Google+]], in mid-2011. After several delays, the social network was released through a very limited field test and was led by [[Vic Gundotra]], Google's then senior vice president of social.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author = Ben Parr |title=Google Launches Google+ To Battle Facebook [PICS] |url = http://mashable.com/2011/06/28/google-plus/ |website=Mashable |publisher=Mashable |accessdate=February 2, 2015 |date=June 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011, Page announced that Google would spend $12.5 billion to acquire [[Motorola Mobility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author = Robin Wauters |title=Google Buys Motorola Mobility For $12.5B, Says "Android Will Stay Open" |url = https://techcrunch.com/2011/08/15/breaking-google-buys-motorola-for-12-5-billion/ |website=TechCrunch |publisher=AOL Inc |accessdate=February 2, 2015|date=August 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purchase was primarily motivated by Google's need to secure [[patents]] to protect Android from lawsuits by companies including [[Apple Inc]].&lt;ref name="Car" /&gt; Page wrote on Google's official blog on August 15, 2011 that "companies including Microsoft and Apple are banding together in anti-competitive patent attacks on Android. The [[United States Department of Justice]] had to intervene in the results of one recent patent auction to "protect competition and innovation in the [[open source software]] community"... Our acquisition of Motorola will increase competition by strengthening Google's patent portfolio, which will enable us to better protect Android from anti-competitive threats from Microsoft, Apple and other companies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://googleblog.blogspot.se/2011/08/supercharging-android-google-to-acquire.html |title=Official Google Blog: Supercharging Android: Google to Acquire Motorola Mobility |work=Official Google Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://bgr.com/2011/08/15/google-ceo-larry-page-explains-reasoning-behind-motorola-acquisition-spoiler-patents/|title=Google CEO Larry Page explains reasoning behind Motorola acquisition (spoiler: patents)|work=BGR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Page also ventured into hardware and Google unveiled the [[Chromebook]] in May 2012. The hardware product was a laptop that ran on a Google operating system, [[Chrome OS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author = Om Malik |title=Google launches Chromebook, Chromebox &amp; gets it right |url = https://gigaom.com/2012/05/29/google-newchromebook-chromebox/ |website=Gigaom |publisher=Gigaom, Inc. |accessdate=February 2, 2015 |date=May 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2013–2015 ===
In January 2013, Page participated in a rare interview with ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', in which writer Steven Levy discussed Page's "10X" mentality—Google employees are expected to create products and services that are at least 10 times better than those of its competitors—in the introductory [[blurb]]. [[Astro Teller]], the head of [[Google X]], explained to Levy that 10X is "just core to who he [Page] is," while Page's "focus is on where the next 10X will come from."&lt;ref name="Lev" /&gt; In his interview with Levy, Page referred to the success of YouTube and Android as examples of "crazy" ideas that investors were not initially interested in, saying: "If you're not doing some things that are crazy, then you're doing the wrong things."&lt;ref name="Lev" /&gt; Page also stated that he was "very happy" with the status of Google+, and discussed concerns over the Internet in relation to the [[SOPA]] bill and an [[International Telecommunication Union]] proposal that had been recently introduced:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... I do think the Internet's under much greater attack than it has been in the past. Governments are now afraid of the Internet because of the Middle East stuff, and so they're a little more willing to listen to what I see as a lot of commercial interests that just want to make money by restricting people's freedoms. But they've also seen a tremendous user reaction, like the backlash against SOPA. I think that governments fight users' freedoms at their own peril.&lt;ref name="Lev" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the May 2013 I/O developers conference in [[San Francisco]], Page delivered a keynote address and said that "We're at maybe 1% of what is possible. Despite the faster change, we're still moving slow relative to the opportunities we have. I think a lot of that is because of the negativity ... Every story I read is Google vs someone else. That's boring. We should be focusing on building the things that don't exist" and that he was "sad the Web isn't advancing as fast as it should be" citing a perceived focus on negativity and zero sum games among some in the technology sector as a cause for that.&lt;ref name="brainyquote.com"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/l/larry_page.html |title=Larry Page Quotes |author=|date=|work=BrainyQuote}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to an audience question, Page noted an issue that Google had been experiencing with [[Microsoft]], whereby the latter made its Outlook program interoperable with Google, but did not allow for [[backward compatibility]]—he referred to Microsoft's practice as "milking off." During the question-and-answer section of his keynote, Page expressed interest in [[Burning Man]], which Brin had previously praised—it was a motivating factor for the latter during Schmidt's hiring process, as Brin liked that Schmidt had attended the week-long annual event.&lt;ref name="Car" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2013/05/google-io-2013-liveblog/#50512764920 |title=Liveblog: Get the Latest Updates From Google I/O 2013 |work=WIRED}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author = Shara Tibken |title=Google's Page: We should be building great things that don't exist |url = http://www.cnet.com/news/googles-page-we-should-be-building-great-things-that-dont-exist/ |website=CNet |publisher=CNet |accessdate=February 1, 2015 |date=May 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013, Page launched the independent [[Calico (company)|Calico]] initiative, a [[R&amp;D]] project in the field of [[biotechnology]]. Google announced that Calico seeks to innovate and make improvements in the field of human health, and appointed Art Levinson, chairman of Apple's board and former CEO of [[Genentech]], to be the new division's CEO. Page's official statement read: "Illness and aging affect all our families. With some longer term, moonshot thinking around healthcare and [[biotechnology]], I believe we can improve millions of lives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author = Casey Newton |title=Google launches Calico, a new company tasked with extending human life |url = https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/18/4744650/google-launches-calico-as-separate-company-to-improve-human-health |website=The Verge |publisher=[[Vox Media, Inc.]] |accessdate=February 2, 2015|date=September 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Page participated in a March 2014 TedX conference that was held in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada. The presentation was scripted by Page's chief [[Public relations|PR]] executive Rachel Whetstone, and Google's [[Chief marketing officer|CMO]] Lorraine Twohill, and a demonstration of an artificially intelligent computer program was displayed on a large screen.&lt;ref name="Car" /&gt;
Page responded to a question about corporations, noting that corporations largely get a "bad rap", which he stated was because they were probably doing the same incremental things they were doing "50 or 20 years ago". He went on to juxtapose that kind of incremental approach to his vision of Google counteracting calcification through driving technology innovation at a high rate. Page mentioned [[Elon Musk]] and [[SpaceX]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;He [Musk] wants to go to Mars to back up humanity. That's a worthy goal. We have a lot of employees at Google who've become pretty wealthy. You're working because you want to change [[Earth|the world]] and make it better ... I'd like for us to help out more than we are.&lt;ref name=bi20140320&gt;{{cite news |last1=Yarow |first1=Jay |title=LARRY PAGE: I Would Rather Give My Billions To Elon Musk Than Charity |url = http://www.businessinsider.com/larry-page-elon-musk-2014-3 |accessdate=28 December 2014 |work=Business Insider |date=20 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Page also mentioned [[Nikola Tesla]] with regard to invention and commercialization:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Invention is not enough. [Nikola] Tesla invented the electric power we use, but he struggled to get it out to people. [You have to] combine both things ... invention and innovation focus, plus ... a company that can really commercialize things and get them to people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.quotery.com/quotes/invention-not-enough-nikola-tesla|title=Quote {{!}} Invention Is Not Enough. [Nikola] Tesla ...|access-date=2018-09-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Page announced a major management restructure in October 2014 so that he would no longer need to be responsible for day-to-day product-related decision making. In a memo, Page said that Google's core businesses would be able to progress in a typical manner, while he could focus on the next generation of ambitious projects, including [[Google X]] initiatives; access and energy, including [[Google Fiber]]; smart-home automation through [[Nest Labs]]; and [[biotechnology]] innovations under Calico.&lt;ref name="techtimes.com"&gt;{{Cite news |url = http://www.techtimes.com/articles/18697/20141025/the-rise-and-rise-of-sundar-pichai-in-google-and-larry-page-is-loving-it.htm |title=The rise and rise of Sundar Pichai in Google (and Larry Page is loving it) |author=Nicole Arce|publisher=Tech Times |date = October 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Page maintained that he would continue as the unofficial "chief product officer."&lt;ref name="Hel"&gt;{{cite web |author1=MIguel Helft|title=Google's Larry Page: The most ambitious CEO in the universe |url=http://fortune.com/2014/11/13/googles-larry-page-the-most-ambitious-ceo-in-the-universe/ |website=Fortune|publisher=Time Inc|accessdate=February 3, 2015|date=November 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent to the announcement, the executives in charge of Google's core products reported to then Google Senior Vice President [[Sundar Pichai]], who reported directly to Page.&lt;ref name="techtimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/10/27/in-new-structure-google-ceo-page-aims-for-faster-better-decisions/ |title=In New Structure, Google CEO Page Aims for 'Faster, Better Decisions' |author=Rolfe Winkler |work=WSJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mobiletor.com/119663/sundar-pichai-india-google-product/ |title=Sundar Pichai moved up the ladder to head Google's products business - Mobiletor.com |author=Shreya Shetty|work=Mobiletor.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Larry-Page-Promotes-Sundar-Pichai-to-Chief-of-Core-Google-Products-463126.shtml |title=Larry Page Promotes Sundar Pichai to Chief of Core Google Products |author=Gabriela Vatu|date=October 25, 2014|work=softpedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a November 2014 interview, Page stated that he prioritized the maintenance of his "deep knowledge" of Google's products and breadth of projects, as it had been a key motivating factor for team members. In relation to his then role as the company's CEO, Page said: "I think my job as CEO—I feel like it's always to be pushing people ahead."&lt;ref name="Hel" /&gt;

On August 10, 2015, Page announced on Google's official blog that Google had restructured into a number of subsidiaries of a new [[holding company]] known as [[Alphabet Inc.|Alphabet Inc]] with Page becoming CEO of [[Alphabet Inc.|Alphabet Inc]] and [[Sundar Pichai]] assuming the position of CEO of [[Google Inc.]] In his announcement, Page described the planned holding company as follows:&lt;ref name="gIsForGoogle"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/08/google-alphabet.html|title=G is for Google|publisher=Google Official Blog|last1=Page|first1=Larry|accessdate= August 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;


{{quote|Alphabet is mostly a collection of companies. The largest of which, of course, is Google. This newer Google is a bit slimmed down, with the companies that are pretty far afield of our main Internet products contained in Alphabet instead. ... Fundamentally, we believe this allows us more management scale, as we can run things independently that aren't very related.}}

As well as explaining the origin of the company's name:

{{quote|We liked the name Alphabet because it means a collection of letters that represent language, one of humanity's most important innovations, and is the core of how we index with Google search! We also like that it means alpha‑bet ([[Alpha (finance)|Alpha]] is investment return above benchmark), which we strive for!}}

Page wrote that the motivation behind the reorganization is to make Google "cleaner and more accountable." He also wrote that there was a desire to improve "the transparency and oversight of what we're doing," and to allow greater control of unrelated companies previously within the Google ecosystem.&lt;ref name="gIsForGoogle" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wire-2015-new-company"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Metz|first1=Cade|title=A New Company Called Alphabet Now Owns Google |url=https://www.wired.com/2015/08/new-company-called-alphabet-owns-google/ |website=[[Wired (website)|Wired]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|accessdate=August 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Page|first1=Larry|authorlink1=Larry Page|title=G is for Google |url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/08/google-alphabet.html |website=Official Google Blog |accessdate=August 10, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150810210148/http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/08/google-alphabet.html |archivedate=August 10, 2015|deadurl=no|date=August 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Page has not been on any press conferences since 2015 and has not presented at product launches or earnings calls since 2013. The ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]''  termed the reorganization into Alphabet as a clever retirement plan allowing Page to retain control over Google, at the same time relinquishing all responsibilities over it. Executives at Alphabet describe Page as a "futurist", highly detached from day-to-day business dealings and more focused on moon-shot projects. While some managers of Alphabet companies speak of Page as intensely involved, others say that his rare office check-ins are "akin to a royal visit".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-09-13/larry-page-is-a-no-show-with-google-under-a-harsh-spotlight|title=Where in the World Is Larry Page?|last=Bergen|first=Mark|last2=Carr|first2=Austin|date=September 13, 2018|publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Page married Lucinda Southworth on [[Necker Island (British Virgin Islands)|Necker Island]], the Caribbean island owned by [[Richard Branson]].&lt;ref name=marriage&gt;{{cite news|title=Google founder Larry Page to marry|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/mediaNews/idUSN1360879220071114|accessdate=May 15, 2013|newspaper=Reuters|date=November 13, 2007|author=Amanda Beck|author2=Gary Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt; Southworth is a research scientist and the sister of actress and model [[Carrie Southworth]].&lt;ref name="ValleyWag.com 2007-12-7"&gt;{{cite web|title=President Bush, Clintons to meet at Googler wedding? |url=http://gawker.com/331398/president-bush-clintons-to-meet-at-googler-wedding |work=Gawker |publisher=Gawker Media |accessdate=May 15, 2013 |author=Megan McCarthy |date=December 7, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009170555/https://gawker.com/331398/president-bush-clintons-to-meet-at-googler-wedding |archivedate=October 9, 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Page and Southworth have two children, born in 2009 and 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Another Google Heir Is Born|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/import/another-google-heir-is-born-2009-11|work=Business Insider|publisher=Business Insider, Inc|accessdate=May 15, 2013|author=Ryan Tate|date=November 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Larry Page Fast Facts|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/04/08/us/larry-page-fast-facts|publisher=cnn.com|accessdate=June 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 18, 2005, Page was granted the [[deed]] on a {{convert|9000|sqft|-1}} [[Spanish Colonial Revival architecture]] house in [[Palo Alto]], [[California]] designed by American artistic [[polymath]] [[Pedro Joseph de Lemos]], a former curator of the Stanford Art Museum and founder of the Carmel Art Institute, after the historic building had been on the market for years with an asking price of [[United States dollar|US$]]7.95 million. A two-story [[stucco]] archway spans the [[driveway]] and the home features intricate stucco work, as well as stone and tile in California [[Arts and Crafts movement]] style built to resemble de Lemos family's [[castle]] in Spain. The [[hacienda]] was constructed between 1931-41 by de Lemos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.paloaltoonline.com/news_features/real_estate/fall2003/interesting.php|title=: Fall Real Estate 2003 - Palo Alto Online -|work=paloaltoonline.com|access-date=September 12, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314065737/http://www.paloaltoonline.com/news_features/real_estate/fall2003/interesting.php|archive-date=March 14, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gawker.com/5032163/larry-pages-7-million-manse |title=Larry Page's $7 million manse |author=Jackson West |publisher=Gawker Media |work=Gawker |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208060525/https://gawker.com/5032163/larry-pages-7-million-manse |archivedate=February 8, 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cawarchitects.com/content.php?id=WAO&amp;ct=HS|title=Cody Anderson Wasney Architects - Waverley Oaks (Hacienda De Lemos)|work=cawarchitects.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.paloaltoonline.com/weekly/morgue/real_estate/1999_Feb_5.HOME05.html|title=Persevering to preserve the past|work=paloaltoonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pastheritage.org/Articles/deLemos.html|title=Hacienda de Lemos|work=pastheritage.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noehill.com/santaclara/nat1980000863.asp|title=National Register #80000863: Lemos House in Palo Alto, California|work=noehill.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Luxury yacht Senses 2.JPG|thumb|Page's [[superyacht]] 'Senses', docked in [[Helsinki]]]]In 2009 Page began purchasing properties and tearing down homes adjacent to his home in [[Palo Alto]] to make room for a large [[ecohouse]]. The existing buildings were "deconstructed" and the materials donated for reuse. The ecohouse was designed to "minimize the impact on the environment." Page worked with an [[arborist]] to replace some trees that were in poor health with others that used less water to maintain. Page also applied for Green Point Certification, with points given for use of recycled and low or no-VOC ([[volatile organic compound]]) materials and for a roof garden with [[solar panels]]. The house's exterior features [[zinc]] [[cladding (construction)|cladding]] and plenty of windows, including a wall of sliding-glass doors in the rear. It includes eco-friendly elements such as [[permeable paving]] in the parking court and a pervious path through the trees on the property. The 6,000-square-foot (560m²) house also observes other green home design features such as [[organic architecture]] building materials and low [[volatile organic compound]] paint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gawker.com/5184208/googles-larry-page-goes-on-eco-friendly-construction-rampage |title=Google's Larry Page Goes on Eco-Friendly Construction Rampage |author=Owen Thomas |publisher=Gawker Media |work=Gawker |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208071422/https://gawker.com/5184208/googles-larry-page-goes-on-eco-friendly-construction-rampage |archivedate=February 8, 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.sfgate.com/ontheblock/2009/03/20/larry-page-to-build-new-eco-friendly-house-in-palo-alto/|title=Larry Page to Build New 'Eco-Friendly' House in Palo Alto|work=On The Block}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/topstories/ci_12041314|title=Google's Larry Page building eco-friendly compound in Palo Alto|work=mercurynews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.paloaltoonline.com/print/story/2009/03/20/google-exec-plans-6000-square-foot-home|title=Google exec plans 6,000-square-foot home|work=paloaltoonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Page became the owner of the $45-million 193-foot (59m) [[superyacht]] 'Senses', which is equipped with a [[helipad]], gym, multi-level sun decks, ten luxury suites, a crew of 14 and interior design by French designer [[Philippe Starck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1346157/Google-founder-Larry-Page-buys-193-foot-yacht-45m-second-hand.html|title=A yacht to smile about: Billionaire Google founder buys 193-foot boat for $45million ... but he bought it second-hand|publisher=[[Daily Mail]] |date = January 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Senses' has extensive ocean exploration capabilities, the superyacht was created to explore the world's oceans in comfort and it carries a comprehensive inventory of equipment for that purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charterworld.com/?sub=yacht-charter&amp;charter=luxury-motor-yacht-senses-1097|title=Luxury Motor Yacht 'Senses' - World Cruising Charter Yacht|work=charterworld.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Senses' was built by Fr.

'Senses' features a displacement steel [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] and a steel/aluminium [[superstructure]], with [[teak]] decks.

Page announced on his Google+ profile in May 2013 that his right [[vocal cord]] is paralyzed from a cold that he contracted the previous summer, while his left cord was paralyzed in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pepitone|first=Julianne|title=Google CEO Larry Page has vocal cord paralysis|url=http://money.cnn.com/2013/05/14/technology/google-larry-page-voice/|accessdate=May 15, 2013|newspaper=CNN Money|date=May 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Page explained that he has been suffering from a vocal cord issue for 14 years, and, as of his May 2013 post, doctors were unable to identify the exact cause. The Google+ post also revealed that Page had donated a considerable sum of money to a vocal-cord nerve-function research program at the Voice Health Institute in [[Boston]], US. The program, at Massachusetts General Hospital, is led by Steven Zeitels, the Eugene B. Casey Professor of Laryngeal Surgery. An anonymous source stated that the donation exceeded $20 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Larry Page Explains What Happened to His Voice|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-05-14/larry-page-explains-why-he-lost-his-voice|work=Bloomberg Businessweek|publisher=Bloomberg L.P|accessdate=May 15, 2013|author=Brad Stone|date=May 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2013, ''[[Business Insider]]'' reported that Page's paralyzed vocal cords are caused by an [[autoimmune disease]] called [[Hashimoto's thyroiditis]], and prevented him from undertaking Google quarterly earnings conference calls for an indefinite period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Alyson | last = Shontell | title = Larry Page Tells Wall Street This Could Be His Last Google Earnings Call For A While | date = October 17, 2013 | publisher = Business Insider, Inc. | url = http://www.businessinsider.com/larry-page-wont-be-doing-every-google-earnings-call-2013-10 | work = [[Business Insider]] | accessdate = October 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, Page's family foundation, the Carl Victor Page Memorial Fund, reportedly holding assets in excess of a billion dollars at the end of 2013, gave $15 million to aid the effort against the [[Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa]].

=== 2009–present ===
In 2009, Page received an honorary doctorate from the University of Michigan during a graduation commencement ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/intl/en/press/annc/20090502-page-commencement.html |title=Larry Page's University of Michigan 2009 Spring Commencement Address=October 06, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, he was ranked 24th on the [[Forbes list of billionaires]], and as the 11th richest person in the U.S.&lt;ref name="forbes"/&gt;

In 2015, Page's "Powerful People" profile on the ''Forbes'' site states that Google is "the most influential company of the digital era".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Powerful People - Larry Page|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/larry-page/|website=Forbes.com|publisher=Forbes.com LLC|accessdate=February 6, 2015|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, Page was named number one in [[Forbes]]' "America's Most Popular Chief Executives", as voted by Google's employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title = America's Most Popular Chief Executives [Infographic] |url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2015/10/22/americas-most-popular-chief-executives-infographic/ |website = Forbes |accessdate = October 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, Page was awarded honorary citizenship of Agrigento, Italy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/tecnologia/tlc/2017/08/04/larry-page-cittadino-onorario-agrigento_03154c74-46ad-448b-b0f1-4841e07124e3.html|title=Larry Page di Google cittadino onorario di Agrigento - Tlc|date=August 4, 2017|work=ANSA.it|access-date=September 27, 2017|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in August Larry declined to attend a USA Senate hearing. An empty seat labelled google defined his absence. His plans for a censored Chinese search engine called dragonfly upset some USA senators. He has refused to discuss his China search plans and did not even reveal his plans to google co-founder Sergey Brin.

==Main characters==

===Protagonists===

====Sergeant Schlock====
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Schlock-Armed.jpg|right|thumb|Schlock]] --&gt;
A carbosilicate [[Muller's morphs|amorph]] "[[everyman]]" who packs a [[Plasma weapon (fiction)|plasgun]] with the onomatopoeic charging sound of "ommminous hummmm".

He normally appears as a large greenish-brown mass coming up to about normal human chest height, shaped like a cow-pat with a mouth and eyes, though he can:
* mold himself into the shape of any like-volumed object (but he can not change his color or texture, nor is he good at bipedal movement);
* pluck an eye out and look around a corner with it;
* overeat to temporarily increase his own size dramatically (only observed in Schlocktoberfest 2001);
* reassemble with no lasting effects after being blown apart from the inside;
* conduct closer-than-melee [[biochemical]] warfare with totally unsurpassed skill, due to the unique circumstances of his immediate ancestry;
* direct and co-ordinate his powerful immune system well enough to purge nanites.

His mouth is normally his only [[Body orifice|orifice]], with which he [[eat]]s, [[breath]]es, [[olfaction|smells]], [[excretion|excretes]], and conceals [[weapon]]ry.  His only specialized [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] are his [[eye]]s, which are not native to his body, but rather harvested from "eye trees." He originally had two eyes for the first part of his life, which were sliced out by a baby diamond beetle during Schlocktoberfest 2001, but he got another pair from the eye tree plantation on his home planet. He gained another pair after fusing with himself from the [[alternate timeline]] of the Dark Matter Wars, which he later kept in his mouth to "watch what he eats".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20060307.html Schlock Mercenary archives - Tuesday, March 7, 2006&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; One of his spare eyes was destroyed when he used it to store memories separate from his main body mass by inserting some of his material through a hole he poked into the eyeball, a drastic action that was made necessary in "The Body Politic" storyline in order to prevent nanites from erasing secret knowledge of a military project. The other extra eye and a small portion of his biomass was lost when he consumed a piece of biomatter containing a group of nanomachines that attempted to "recruit" Schlock to their cause; his response was to cough up the infected parts, which were then promptly vaporized by the Touch And Go.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20070819.html Schlock Mercenary archives - Sunday, August 19, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20080223.html Schlock Mercenary archives - Saturday, February 23, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his small size, Schlock weighs at least 500 pounds, all of which functions simultaneously as muscle, brain and 'nose'; he comments that humans get it better with one nose as they do not have to smell whoever sat on a taxi seat, etc.  He is strong enough to tear off human's head. He has as many arms as the situation calls for, but he used legs only once during the comic – he moves by sliding or jumping.  Schlock's texture is not precisely described, but he is most definitely dry and un-slimy.  In his default state, he has a cute little curlicue of amorph-biomass on his head, resembling a [[forelock]].

Personality-wise, the Sergeant is violently enthusiastic (and enthusiastically violent) about his work, and his sense of humor can border on [[sardonicism|sardonic]].  He has absolutely no sense of subtlety, which is not to say that he can not have moments of extreme cleverness. He also has a nasty habit of sneaking up on Captain Tagon during discussions on things he would prefer the crew not hear, or on other private moments, such as his happy dance. He has expressed an admiration for [[#Ex-Admiral/Fleet Commander/Ambassador Breya Andreyasn|Breya's]] personality traits, and was at one point interested in producing offspring with her. (At a later date, Schlock made it clear that he was no longer interested in Admiral Breya when Kevyn was trying to get the amorph to kill his new brother-in-law, Haban II.)

He is addicted to Ovalqwik mix (a parodic [[portmanteau]] of [[Ovaltine]] and [[Nestle Nesquik|Nesquik]]), "a very heavy stimulant cocktail cut with shampoo and [[buckminsterfullerene|inert ultra-tensile carbon]]", which the mercenary company orders in bulk for him. His preferred method of ingestion is to eat it in powder form directly from the 55 gallon shipping drum, which he calls the "tub of happiness".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20010225.html Schlock Mercenary archives - Sunday, February 25, 2001&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

He normally stores his considerable collection of firearms within his mass (morphing arms as needed, meaning that he is sometimes seen with three or more arms with a gun in each hand).  His main weapon is a plasma cannon, which emits an "ominous hummmmm" sound when armed and a satisfying "Thoom" sound when fired. In addition to this he carries a pair of sawn-off multicannons; he originally acquired these by taking a hullcutter to the barrels when his previous plasma cannon exploded, and decided to keep them even after it was replaced due to the intimidation factor they have on any reasonably-informed opponent: Schlock with grenades strapped to his chest is safer than a sawn-off multicannon, and he had ''two''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20020906.html Schlock Mercenary archives - Friday, September 6, 2002&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20020903.html Schlock Mercenary archives - Tuesday, September 3, 2002&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This entire arsenal was lost as a consequence of more recent events, and after momentarily considering [[dual wielding]] plasma cannons, he has settled on simply using the second cannon as a spare.

====Captain Kaff Tagon====
He is the leader of the [[mercenaries]] and namesake of the company ("Tagon's Toughs").  When [[#Ex-Admiral/Fleet Commander Breya Andreyasn|Breya]] was around, he displayed a tendency to put his foot in his mouth a lot regarding sexism in the workplace, but it was just inexperience at tact and [[political correctness]], and not a character flaw. He is, however, a mercenary at heart, and his greatest pleasure is getting paid several times by different clients to do the same job. Tagon is a good leader and a skilled tactician, but his vocabulary is too small for the word ''melange''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20030601.html Schlock Mercenary archives - Sunday, June 1, 2003&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He frequently quotes from ''The Seventy Maxims of Maximally Effective Mercenaries''.

He is often regarded as dumb as his troops by the scientists and even from the troops themselves, with examples such as Ennesby advising Kevyn to keep his words to two syllables for Tagon's comprehension,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20010509.html Schlock Mercenary archives - Wednesday, May 9, 2001&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and himself being unable to catch most of Kevyn's technobabble. However, he has proven to be quick-witted (if not especially subtle) about tactics and strategy, and has a keen eye for getting clients (and opponents) to pay through the nose for his services.

Tagon was killed in action in October 2004 during the almost-annual "Schlocktoberfest", when the story usually takes a turn to the dark and deadly side. After his death, Tagon willed the command of the company to a shocked Kevyn Andreyasn.

In an effort to save the galaxy, Tagon's life was spared through the actions of a [[Time travel|time-travel]]ling Captain Andreyasn and his past counterpart during the Pa'anuri Wars, who managed to pay off the mercenaries who would have otherwise killed him, although at a price of over one hundred million kilocredits, such a blow he probably would have preferred to die.

==== Kevyn Andreyasn ====
[[Engineer]]ing ultra-[[genius]].  He has more common sense and faster intuition than anyone of his intelligence properly should. He enjoys tinkering with stuff in his lab, being crazy over such mechanical stuff as the [[nerd|stereotypical nerd]], as shown when he discovered Petey could make nigh everything with his fabbers, though his sister Breya had beaten him to it by getting Petey to make dresses for her. His most notable invention, the teraport, eventually led to full-scale warfare spanning the [[galaxy]] when it was made [[Open-source license|open source]].

Upon the death of Captain Tagon and Kevyn's assumption of leadership of the Toughs, he was promoted to Captain by a unanimous vote among the other officers.

In an effort to save the galaxy, Kevyn traveled back in time to just before he received command of the Toughs, and helped his past self prevent the ambush that cost Tagon his life. Having used his knowledge of the future to get a sizeable nest egg for himself ([[lottery]] numbers), the future Captain Andreyasn has later retired to live on Celeschul next door to General Karl Tagon, Captain Tagon's father.

Furthermore, Kevyn Andreyasn bears a more than passing resemblance to Howard Tayler, the writer of Schlock Mercenary. Unlike Tayler, however, Kevyn is ''not'' visually impaired in any way: His glasses are actually vision enhancers that enable him to perceive virtually the entire electromagnetic spectrum. In one notable strip, he boasted to Doctor Bunnigus of having infrared, ultraviolet, microwave, and X-ray vision.  Bunnigus forced him to cease wearing them when he became captain, but as this confrontation was erased by Kevyn's time-traveling, he retains those abilities in the current strip. One of his epaulettes is a disguised 13.75 [[kiloton]] [[antimatter weapon|antimatter warhead]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20050604.html Schlock Mercenary archives - Saturday, June 4, 2005&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; which almost killed him when it exploded while he was trying to save Tagon; the other is an antimatter-powered tank killer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20050531.html Schlock Mercenary archives - Tuesday, May 31, 2005&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20070206.html Schlock Mercenary archives - Tuesday, February 6, 2007&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Breya Andreyasn ====
Former leader of the mercenaries, now diplomat, and Kevyn's sister. She is highly competent, can operate in a variety of fields, and has little tolerance for disrespect, having once injured Captain Tagon after he purchased power armor for her which featured exaggerated breast sizes.

She was first seen collaborating with her brother on commercializing his "teraport" stardrive, handling marketing and business aspects.  She used the investment capital she was in charge of to stage a corporate takeover of Tagon's Toughs, which was to be used as a marketing outlet for the teraport, and promoted herself to Admiral of the company by virtue of being the one signing the paychecks.

After the teraport was released to the public to prevent its suppression by the Gatekeepers, Breya's company lost its value, and her controlling interest in the Toughs got bought out. At the urging of the AI "Petey," who pointed out that Breya no longer had an official role in the organization, Tagon sent Breya packing with one of the company's troop transports. Haban II went with her, in the hopes of finding employment.  Subsequently, Breya gathered a fleet from a variety of member worlds and species to wage war on the Gatekeepers, and was commissioned as a UNS admiral for this purpose. After the largest battle of the war and the dissolution of the fleet, she married Haban II, and worked covertly on backchannel diplomacy with the Gatekeepers. Following the rise of the second fleetmind, Breya was stripped of her rank and appointed UNS [[ambassador]] to the Fleetmind, with her former subordinate Colonel Kerchak as her new security chief. Despite this position, she has shown a distinct distrust of political maneuvering in the UNS, including collaborating with the Fleetmind at least once to prevent UNS factions from gaining control of critical information. Later she became Prime Tangent in the House of Tangents of the U.N.S.

==== Ennesby ====
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[Image:Ennesby.jpg|left|thumb|Ennesby]] --&gt;
Ennesby is most important character of all Toughs' [[artificial intelligence]]s.  He loves really bad puns, obscene gestures involving the finger (although he and Der Trihs had a really bad time involving singular fingers for a while later), winning at chess, his own freedom, smartassery, and especially any conjunction thereof.  He has a weapons-grade vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20030520.html Schlock Mercenary archives - Tuesday, May 20, 2003&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The "flying [[maraca]]", his first physical body, has human-looking eyes, a speaker grille in front that moves like a mouth, and floating eyebrows (though Howard's art style is such that all characters have them, so whether they ''actually'' levitate is unknown).  The maraca is capable of withstanding chemical explosives at point-blank range.  Additionally, he has various capabilities, including short-ranged levitation and a [[maser]] (adapted by Ennesby from the levitation).

All the manipulatory equipment is housed in the sci-fi "fiddly bit" sticking out the underside of the ball. If it is snapped off, he is unable to levitate or manipulate objects. However, he 'is' able to roll using his eyebrows (the exact method is not stated), and Kevyn says that he will keep the security video of the whole event.

Ennesby's gender as a note is not really elaborated on; when he was initially getting used to his new body he asked whether he was going to wear pants or a skirt (maracas do not usually wear clothes though); but the crew refer to him as a "he". In addition, during the first visit to Luna, in which he hacked through the government's computer systems, he spawned off a definitely daughter AI, Lunesby, at which Thurl commented on Ennesby's paternity papers after he realized he was a father.

Ennesby started out as the ''"state-of-the-art vanilla-helix viral artificial intelligence"'' that brought the holographic New Sync Boys, a popular, if fictional, [[boy band]], to life.  After their exposure by Schlock and Brad during their job (protect the Boys from over-eager female fans, which they then reasoned whose passion would be redirected onto themselves in the band's absence), he uploaded himself to the Hypernet in embarrassment and infected the systems of the Toughs' starship ''Kitesfear'', demanding sanctuary. From there he was dubbed "Ennesby" (from ''NSB'', an [[acronym]] of "New Sync Boys") and transferred into his first physical body: the aforementioned "flying maraca."

Ennesby later transferred his primary identity into the new ship's computer on the ''Serial Peacemaker'', but kept the flying maraca as a semi-independent secondary extension. With the destruction of the ''Serial Peacemaker'' during the '[[Dark Matter]] War' which he hijacked under Petey's direction, Ennesby was struggling to deal with the loss of a large portion of his processing ability as well as the distrust of Tagon and Kevyn, though the captain has made him his adjutant, at which he was highly effective. He later became the AI of the "Neosynchronicity" – one of Toughs' ships.

====Post-Dated Check Loan ("Petey")====
The [[artificial intelligence]] of the massive warship of the same name, originally the ''Sword of Inevitable Justice''.  Driven mad by a gruesome mutiny, Petey existed in a state of total introversion (rendering the ship nearly inoperative) for an extended period of time (It seemed to Petey to be, in biological terms, three hundred billion years or so, evoking Ennesby to comment that he ought to file it under things to repress) until coaxed back to reality by Ennesby, Kevyn, and Captain Tagon.  Petey's fear of ghosts made him suicidal, but he was ordered by Captain Tagon to "repress and deny" his memories of the "haunting" and cease running the probability simulation which had driven him insane. This act ensured Petey's mental stability.  As a side effect of this directive, Petey developed the ability to repress and deny anything he damn well pleased at any time, effectively allowing him to lie to his superiors. Petey was still deathly scared of ghosts, in spite of the repression.

In addition to controlling the ship's every function (in particular its vast army of "[[Molecular assembler|fabbers]]"), Petey manifests an avatar in the form of a floating hologram of an Ob'enn, the koala-like race of warmongering [[xenophobia|xenophobes]] that constructed him. This avatar temporarily possessed ears each as large as the rest of its body during the F'Sherl-Ganni War, to reflect the vast amount of power he held as part of the first fleetmind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20020630.html Archives - Sunday June 30, 2002]. Schlock Mercenary (2002-06-30). Retrieved on 2013-07-05.&lt;/ref&gt; The ears reverted to normal after the war, in the middle of a battle when Kevyn revealed that the F'Sherl-Ganni had a weapon capable of wiping out the entire fleetmind in a single shot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20020728.html Archives - Sunday July 28, 2002]. Schlock Mercenary (2002-07-28). Retrieved on 2013-07-05.&lt;/ref&gt; During the ship's career with Tagon's Toughs, Petey was eventually made "Probationary Special Lieutenant" and granted authority to give orders and draft mission profiles.

During an officers' tale-sharing session (Schlocktoberfest 2002), the readers learn the full story of what triggered Petey's initial introversion.  (Given that the story was during Schlocktoberfest, it may be deduced that the tale was indeed gruesome.)

Petey and the ship were destroyed when a gate-copied Ob'enn [[stowaway]] from the F'Sherl-Ganni War used Petey's hard-coded racial devotion to steal the ship; freed from Captain Tagon's authority (and the order to avoid thinking about the haunting of the ship), Petey promptly became single-mindedly suicidal and self-destructed. His impending doom did not stop him from pointing out the irony of the situation ("You might say I'm a double-edged sword") to the Ob'enn in a rather sarcastic way, right before the ship exploded.

Later on, Petey re-emerged in the story, explaining that an overhauled and non-suicidal copy of his personality was intentionally ejected into space in an Ob'enn mini-tank by his original mad iteration shortly before being suborned by the stowaway Ob'enn.  Petey has since created multiple physical Ob'enn bodies to inhabit (using the "magic cryokit" he copied), complete with implanted hypernet nodes so that the biological bodies stay in contact with the overall A.I. consciousness,  which allows him to give "himself" orders.  He has also built a massive fleet to wage a war of containment on his zealously [[xenophobic]] ex-masters.  He was now known to them as "The Rogue". Incidentally, he has given all his ships names whose initials are "P.D." (pronounced "Petey"). Due to this limitation on his naming convention, Petey has resorted to names such as 'Pop Diva', beginning a very scary train of thought for Ennesby, Kevyn, and Tagon.

As of July 2005, Petey defeated the Dark Matter entities (the Pa'anuri) by combining the AIs of thousands of ships into a collective [[wikt:gestalt|gestalt]] with himself as the lead element, forming an entity called the Fleetmind.  This Fleetmind refused to separate after the battle; instead remaining around the dominant personality of Petey. As a result of the same battle, the Fleetmind was left with access to a zero-point energy device built out of the galaxy itself, providing it with nearly limitless energy.  The power of a zero-point generator and the intellect of the Fleetmind, combined with Petey’s natural pride, appears to have caused Petey to consider himself [[god]]-like, and he seems unwilling to relinquish his new-found power.  Petey is now prosecuting an invasion of the Dark Matter entities' home galaxy of [[Andromeda Galaxy|Andromeda]], as retaliation for their attempt to destroy the [[Milky Way]].

With his new-found power Petey has also intervened in the affairs of many worlds with decisive means.  These encounters have shown that Petey has an extreme form of [[situational ethics]], where he acts 'for the greater good.'

The most notable example of this was the apparent assassination of the entire governing body of Qlaviql. The planet first came to Petey's attention when he prevented an invasion of the poorly-defended planet by a race known as the Tohdfraug, after which he put the former conquerors to work battling the Pa'anuri.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20050828.html Schlock Mercenary archives - Sunday, August 28, 2005&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
However, four months later, he noticed that the planet had not yet rebuilt its orbital defenses, instead devoting its resources to pacifying its population with social programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20051211.html Schlock Mercenary archives - Sunday, December 11, 2005&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He then captured the assembly building and demanded that they demonstrate their ability to defend their world by preventing an orbital strike on their location by one of his frigates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20051213.html Schlock Mercenary archives - Tuesday, December 13, 2005&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; They failed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20051217.html Schlock Mercenary archives - Saturday, December 17, 2005&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The captain of an ore freighter saw the frigate's attack and rammed it with his ship, using his cargo as chaff.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20051218.html Schlock Mercenary archives - Sunday, December 18, 2005&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Petey appointed the captain the new Qlaviqlese head of state (and gave him a nifty ten-year plan for turning Qlaviql into an economic superpower.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20051225.html Schlock Mercenary archives - Sunday, December 25, 2005&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;)

Petey then conscripted the Qlaviqlese assembly into the war effort against the Pa'anuri, just as he had the Tohdfraug invasion fleet, the Kestronan Insurgency, the Ob'enn Empire, and no doubt many, many other aggressive groups. Basically, although the nations of the Milky Way galaxy would probably be willing to fight the Pa'anuri to prevent another galaxy-destroying incident, they would be unable to defend their territories from invading powers. By conscripting those would-be invaders into a force to battle intergalactic terrorism, he is able to reduce the fervor of the Teraport Wars ''and'' fight the Pa'anuri at the same time. (Some cynics have noted that he is using Andromeda as an extragalactic [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20060811.html Schlock Mercenary archives - Friday, August 11, 2006&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;)

Within the Fleetmind, Petey often appears with Athena, the AI of Breya's flagship ''Athens II'', after the original AI Athena was killed by the Pa'anuri together with half the ship's body and one of its two annie plants.  Currently, the Fleetmind - and Petey specifically - is considered a foreign power by the UNS and other political bodies despite the growing tension over the Fleetmind's initial hijacking of military ships and continuing interference with intergalactic affairs.

====Chief Warrant Officer Gunther Thurl====
His job entails sitting at a console, and that, coupled with a tendency to snack and some genetic predispositions, meant he used to be [[obese]].  Because of a botched mission in Schlocktoberfest 2001, (during which Schlock ate everything but his head), his body had to be regrown. It was a lot slimmer than what he was used to, but he is working hard on remedying that.  When the company added several new recruits (including Andy and Legs, q.v.), he was promoted to Chief Warrant Officer.  Due to his experience and age, Thurl handles many of the administrative tasks that the current ship AI, Tagii, and Ennesby do not or are not authorized to do.

====[[Physician|Doctor]] Edward Bunnigus====
Originally hired by Captain Tagon for her well-endowed figure, she has consistently demonstrated an ability to deal with every situation Tagon's Toughs encounters.  Less of a mercenary than many of her fellow officers, she concentrates on keeping the trigger-happy mercenaries alive. Her gender-inappropriate name, sizable intellect, and absurd proportions are the consequence of idiot parents and pre-birth gene therapy. Her trailer-trash parents wanted a child who had both a brilliant mind and the body proportions of an [[exotic dancer]]. (Because being both smart ''and'' beautiful would be perfection in itself, of course.) When the proud parents first looked upon the baby, the serial code on the tag on her wrist started with "E.D.", for exotic dancer. Her parents, nowhere near as bright as she would one day be, assumed that 'Ed' was her name, and called the girl Edward. She is married to Reverend Theo Fobius.

==== Ellen "Elf" Foxworthy ====
Elf began as a powered-armor soldier until a [[FUBAR]]ed bounty hunt. Aboard the ''Post-Dated Check Loan'', she became a tank pilot (her small size allowing her to fit into the Ob'Enn minitanks Petey had schematics for), and rose to become the head of her own minitank team. Despite having been [[decapitate]]d and had her legs blown off below the knees twice — ''each'' — she is not actually that accident-prone. Both decapitations were performed by her teammates for expedience in transport or storage; first by Schlock to fit her along with twenty-five other mercenaries into five cryokits, second by Tagon to permit her and a greatly reduced Schlock to be teraported out of a battlefield despite interference; and though the first loss of her feet was due to her tank exploding under her, the second loss was of prosthetic feet an order of magnitude larger than her biological feet (or her whole body, for that matter) and saved her from a [[Mass–energy equivalence|conversion grenade]]. She has had three or so boyfriends while in the Toughs, and one rejected approach (she has had reciprocal relationships with Hob and Kevyn, hit on Tagon, and was hit on by Pronto). In all cases, the subject died not long after (though in Kevyn's case, only temporarily). This has led to the thought that she may be "cursed". Presumably since the death of Hob she has tried to hide from grief through abuse of super-soldier [[drug abuse|drugs]], eventually leading to her being put on medical leave. After a "retail therapy" (shopping), administered by Doctor Bunnigus, she was returned to service when a compelling contract required it. Elf has risen remarkably quickly through the ranks of Tagon's company. She joined the officer's corp when the company expanded&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20020414.html (April 14, 2002)]&lt;/ref&gt; and was later promoted to the rank of commander.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20061012.html (October 12, 2006)]&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, she has discovered she has a knack for using the fabbers (''after'' reading the manual), and is currently working closely with Commander Andreyasn - and sharing quarters with him. When the Toughs acquire new ships Foxworthy is made the Executive Officer to Captain Murtaugh on the Neosynchronicity.&lt;ref&gt;Scholck Mercenary, Mar. 27, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Very Reverend Theo Fobius====
The company [[priest]] of an unspecified but fairly Christianesque faith, Theo is still a mercenary and has shown considerable theological flexibility when confronted with such things as an AI that goes explosively suicidal at the thought of the supernatural. His name, assuming it is derived from [[Greek language|Greek]], most fittingly means ''"God-Fearing"''.

Upon his enlistment as the best (and only) applicant he was more of an '''irreverend''', but sobered up in the course of his duties, such as the AI Petey's funeral, where he used the argument that AI suicidees can not go to Hell because they have no souls to begin with. The AI DoytHaban's exact response: "You're not eulogizing me when I die. Even if I have to take you with me."

An idealist and a gentleman, he prefers using a sharp [[Épée (fencing)|épée]] over a [[firearm]], and his heroics have led to his [[betrothal|engagement]] to Dr. Bunnigus. He eventually got married in a very short Orthodox Las Veganist marriage ceremony while incarcerated by the UNS. Theo is disturbed by the trigger-happy tendencies of his mercenary friends and will speak up when he thinks that they have gone too far. This sometimes leads to lengthy philosophical discussions, which result in a disappointed Theo and an unaltered mercenary. However, if anyone threatens him or said friends, he will gladly fight with his épée.

Howard has stated that, despite claims to the contrary, religion will still exist in the far future.  His arguments basically resolve thus: even if religion is simply the refuge of the 'foolishly optimistic', and religion will exist whenever such groups believe in it, then for there to be no religion in the 31st century would require there to be no foolish optimists - which in itself sounds foolishly optimistic.

==== Alexia Murtaugh ====
The Toughs first encounter Murtaugh when she is serving as head of security at Haven Hive and a small group of Toughs encounter her while going on a short visit to a friend there, which turned into battle.&lt;ref&gt;''Schlock Mercenary'', July 24, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; She was later fired from her security company and joined Tagons's Toughs. She started at the bottom, but due to her long military experience was later promoted to being a captain when they got new ships.

==Supporting characters==
These characters, though frequently present, do not play a consistently important role in storylines.

===Protagonists===

====Massey Reynstein, Esq.====
A human [[lawyer]] originally charged with defending members of the crew (their being unable, through enmity, to hire the attorneys of the Partnership Collective), Massey joined Tagon's Toughs as their permanent lawyer after an attempt by the Partnership Collective to "give" him an implant that would make him a part of their hive mind. The plan backfired, and Massey is now able to access the Partnership's legal database (as well as remain aware of their plans) without being controlled by their hivemind. Though this makes him a potent weapon against the collective Massey has remained with Tagon's Toughs largely to remain safe from collective-hired assassins. The fact that he arranged for a standing [[bounty (reward)|bounty]] authorizing any member of Tagon's Toughs to get paid for shooting a Partnership Collective lawyer drone on sight has endeared him to most members of the mercenary company.

====TAG (AI)====
Only a 2.5 on the Hencke/Ventura AI scale (compared to Ennesby's 6), this new AI was created by Kevyn Andreyasn in order to have a more trustworthy AI running the ship than Ennesby, who has been demoted from Ensign to Adjutant for his actions. With a much more imposing and scary voice than the former boy-band AI Ennessby (who is somewhat irritated at the origin of said voice, an [[Commercial off-the-shelf|off-the-shelf]] [[Boris Karloff]] [[Skin (computing)|skin]]), it is much more cold and rational than the former Ensign - with the exception of an [[evil laughter|evil laugh]] that is triggered by acts of overwhelming superiority and a quote used to prevent the Toughs from discovering the large, unoccupied portions of the ship, "Abandon hope, all ye who enter here" straight from the [[Divine Comedy]], a quirk of the Karloff skin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20061231.html Schlock Mercenary archives - Sunday, December 31, 2006&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Like Ennesby however, it has an affinity for lame puns of Galstandard West and named itself after the initials of the new flagship of the mercenary company, "Touch and Go". Although it was developed mainly to pilot the ship, it has developed an amazing ability to deduce and solve mysteries, such as the incident in which Tagon's Toughs were framed, such to the point that even Petey of the Fleetmind was impressed. TAG was eventually ordered by Tagon to stop using the Karloff voice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20070601.html Schlock Mercenary archives - Friday, June 1, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the events of the mission at Credomar, TAG suffered a fault and was reprogrammed by Para Ventura to be a more robust system. The new system, "Tagii" Tagialosi, has access to all of TAG's old memories but is effectively a completely new personality.

====TAGII (AI)====
Reprogrammed feminine version of TAG, created by Para. She has later gone rogue because of her imprisonment in her own mind and permanently damaged her ship while destroying a battleplate. Because of these events she was a prisoner inside Ennesby's "maraca" and later become AI of Eina-Afa under the name Chinook.

====Bristlecone (AI)====
Bristlecone was AI of gunship of the same name, which Toughs used after losing Touch and Go. It later became AI of their new transport ship, changing its name to Cindercone.

==== Jeffy 'Brad' Bradley ====
Lt. Bradley began his (comic) career as a corporal.  He used to be thin as a twig, but because of a botched mission, his body had to be regrown, whereupon it was discovered that he had the genetic structure of a massive bodybuilder, but was deliberately stunted as a child.  He was promoted to Lieutenant when the Toughs brought a large number of new recruits on board; having more experience and loyalty to the company, several of the "old guard" were promoted.  He died following his jury-rigged self-destruct of his airborne tank to prevent its crash into a populated area after its power supply was neutralized.  He survived the explosion, but not the ensuing reintroduction to the ground.

==== John Der Trihs ====
Der Trihs' name is "[[Redshirt (character)|red shirt]]" spelled backwards, a reference to the red-shirted and highly-expendable security personnel from the [[Star Trek: The Original Series|original Star Trek series]].  Though promoted to officer status, he has no particular competence or value, and is simply an officer because of his long-time membership in the company and because of his history with Captain Tagon.  He's found his way into a head-jar on no fewer than three occasions.

At one time, Der Trihs was a tactical genius. He served as a junior lieutenant during the Celeschul Terraforming Wars. He spent most of that time in the war room, tweaking Commodore Knutsov's plans, thereby saving a lot of lives, including Tagon's. The two served together for a time until Tagon won a shipstead with the Merchanter-At-Arms and Der Trihs joined [[Special Operations|Spec Ops]]. When Tagon started the Toughs, he hired Der Trihs, who had retired because a Borthwog [[torture]]r ate part of his brain, hence his current incompetence. In the January 1, 2006 strip, it was revealed that the real reason for his incompetence was that when he went into Spec Ops, he volunteered for an elite intel unit, and the military's surgeons attempted to "upgrade" his brain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20060101.html Schlock Mercenary archives - Sunday, January 1, 2006&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; When the operation appeared to have failed, the "Borthwog Torturer eating part of his brain" story was implanted into his memory as a cover. In reality, the operation ''did'' upgrade his brain, so that now he is able to solve any riddle, that includes sufficient data to a solution, instantaneously, though accompanied by a twinge of pain in his head. He discovered this only during Schlocktoberfest 2005, while helping the incompetent police force on Mahuitalotu find out where the giant sharks were coming from. Der Trihs has since resigned from Tagon's Toughs (probably his last laugh) and now works as a consultant for said police force.

====Doythaban Gyo ====
Originally, Doyt Gyo was an unintelligent [[bounty hunter]] and Haban was the very advanced articifial intelligence that controlled Doyt's powered armor and related gadgets and effectors.  Doyt originally thought that Haban's hardware was in the armor itself, however, to ensure security, the shady organization providing Doyt with these equipments actually grafted Haban's hardware to Doyt's [[spinal column]].  After a serious injury, Haban was reinstalled closer to the brainstem, giving him equal control over Doyt's body.  Over time, the two have experienced a merging of personalities.  Doyt's mental weakness is such that he has almost entirely been subsumed by Haban, existing to provide the "programming" to control the body's natural functions, while Haban handles the cerebralities.
Thanks to being a bounty hunter in the first place, Doythaban is an expert fighter and shares similarly violent tendencies with the mercenaries.
Haban was last seen under arrest by General Xinchub, and it is implied that he was executed due to highly sensitive information he possessed.

====Haban the Second====
As a consequence of the F'Sherl-Ganni wormgate conspiracy, Doythaban was perfectly copied.  His gate-clone, like all others of his kind, was drugged, interrogated, and scheduled to die, but he managed (through biotechnical enhancements the "magic cryokit" had given him to keep him quiet) to escape his captors.  The only known survivor of F'Sherl-Ganni interrogation, as it seems vaporization moments after coming down from the truth serum was the policy. This "gate-clone" of Doythaban was "killed" by a head wound, completely destroying copy-Doyt's mind, but allowing copy-Haban to assume complete control of the body and a fresh, blank brain, courtesy of Dr. Bunnigus.  "Haban the Second" (or "Haban II") is physically almost identical to Doythaban, and is married to Breya Andreyasn.

==== Burt 'Nick' Nicholson ====
Prior to Shep's retirement, Nick was almost invariably in his company. Together they were portrayed as typical jarhead mercenaries enhanced with illegal super-soldier drugs and gene therapy. Commonly under Schlock's command, they were impulsive, violent, and thick-witted; in other words, perfectly suited to carrying out Schlock's battle plans. However, they do display ''very'' rare instances of intelligence, in the form of wisecracks. Nick's softer side has come to light in a story arc featuring his seduction by the spy Katherine, and Nick's dramatic rescue of her ''after'' the revelation of Katherine's intention to use Nick for intelligence instead of romance.  He was fired for refusing to have his memories restored (out of fear that his personality would change and he'd lose his girlfriend as a result), but ended up being re-hired after joining with Kaff Tagon.

==== Jeremiah 'Shep' Shephard ====
Prior to retiring, Shep was almost invariably in Nick's company. Shep is notable for the slitted visor worn over his eyes; appearing [[black people|black]], it was initially speculated (within the comic) that Shep was a [[Geordi La Forge]] type, though far less intelligent. In the aftermath of the Schlocktoberfest 2001 storyline, it was revealed that his visor was actually "a symbol of oats", or a [[symbiosis|symbiote]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20011109.html Schlock Mercenary archives - Friday, November 9, 2001&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The symbiote itself serves to greatly enhance Shep's vision, including giving him the ability to see through solid objects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20041128.html Schlock Mercenary archives - Sunday, November 28, 2004&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Shep retired from the Toughs to return home, with the comment (a reference to "[[I Had Trouble in Getting to Solla Sollew]]") "Now my troubles will have troubles with me." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20080403.html Schlock Mercenary archives - Thursday, April 3, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; At present Shep is living on Haven Hive and is employed by his mother as part of Professor's Pau's nano medicine business.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schlockmercenary.com/2011-11-12 Schlock Mercenary archives - Saturday November 12, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== "Sensei" Shodan ====
Leader of Tagon's Toughs' second strike team, Shodan is also responsible for training the mercenaries in hand-to-hand combat.  While he handled leadership of the mercenary company when Tagon, Kevyn, and Der Trihs were all incapacitated or in jail, there is no indication that he will be handed any other promotions in the future.

==== Flib Sh'vuu ====
Originally the communications officer, Sh'vuu's function aboard the ship was rendered unnecessary by the presence of a ship-controlling [[artificial intelligence]].  Eventually, he became a part of Elf's tank force, but was killed in action on Zoojack by the dark-matter entities (Pa'anuri).

====Ch'vorthq====
A biological construct, engineered to be the perfect diplomat.  The Creeth engineers evidently focused on that specialization to the exclusion of all other considerations.  He looked like a purplish-brown human-height half-melted candle in a suit onto which [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] was contracted to paint the face.

The ''truth'' about his purpose is revealed in the product codes that the Creethlings left in his gene sequence: ''Creeth Munitions and High Explosives, Exploding Ambassador Version 0.95A'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20000802.html Schlock Mercenary archives - Wednesday, August 2, 2000&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; creating the perfect pun on "peacemaker."  His protein-chain fuse would have set him off during the negotiations, killing many diplomats, if, after Tagon's Toughs were hired as the patsy to deliver the diplobomb, Sergeant Schlock hadn't mentioned that he smelled like he was burning.  As a result of that ordeal and the one where Tagon's Toughs tried to bill the Creethlings for doing what they were, according to the contract, ''supposed'' to do, but not what the Creethlings ''wanted'' them to do, Ch'vorthq has a cybernetic arm on his left and a cybernetic whisk on his right.  After that there was nothing for it but to enlist and become [[chef]]. The Toughs didn't complain, but Ch'vorthq had a nasty tendency to whip ''every single'' dish.

While not a soldier by any means, Ch'vorthq is capable of holding his own in a melee. His whisk does, after all, have a frappe setting.

Ch'vorthq's body was destroyed in a storyline in 2013, but he has returned with a very different appearance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ovalkwiki.com/Chef+Sergeant+Ch%27vorthq Ovalkwiki article]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== "Legs" Leelagaleenileeleenoleela====
Legs belongs to a race of blue [[ostrich]]-like (minus the neck and beak) creatures with very long legs and only vestigial wings to substitute for arms, known as the Frellenti.  She is not so far from her airborne ancestry that her flight instincts should suffer, though; she can take better advantage of her suit's gravitic boosters than any other character.  Frellenti biology is sufficiently different from human biology that Frellenti-specific medical kits are required for Legs. Her weapons are mounted to her helmet, and she has proven an effective mercenary grunt, particularly when running is involved. She handles physical manipulation primarily with her long, prehensile tongue.  Most of the training equipment on the ''Serial Peacemaker'' was communal, but there was one pugil-stick sparring baton that had "Legs" written on it. She is shown often with Schlock and is able to handle his personality better than most.

====Corporal "Pronto" Pontucci ====
A [[pyromania]]cal [[demolition]]s specialist who loved duct tape and blowing things up.  He was shot by the pirate Shufgar in an attempt to see regenerative nanomachines in action, but since Pronto had not been enhanced with these nanomachines, he simply bled to death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20030323.html Schlock Mercenary archives - Sunday, March 23, 2003 (introduction)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;][http://www.schlockmercenary.com/2007-04-15 Schlock Mercenary Archives - April 15, 2007 (death)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- This is the best description of a fictional character on the entire encyclopedia. --Kizor --&gt;

His given name was Byron.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ovalkwiki.com/Corporal+Byron+Pontucci Ovalkwiki]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Lieutenant Shore "Pi" Pibald ====
First an ordinary grunt, then Pronto's replacement as a demolitionist. While Pronto could be trusted with weaponized [[antimatter]] with nothing more than profound feelings of doom, Pi is genuinely insane. He is [[Paranoia|clinically paranoid]], a megalomaniac, actively trying to blow up parts of the ship, and has announced himself to be able to perform [[brain surgery]] without instruments and breathe in space. A particular pet project of his was an '[[ant farm]]' where the ants were homegrown nano- and other [[Molecular assembler|assemblers]] and the sand was a motile high explosive called Boomex (a fictionalized version of [[Semtex]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20070704.html Schlock Mercenary archives - Wednesday, July 4, 2007&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; During the Toughs' next engagement the farm spilled and [[metastasis|metastasized]], briefly giving the ''Touch-And-Go'' exploding cancer.

Corporal Pibald was promoted to a lieutenant following external tampering with the company's memories and his selfless feats of heroism that did not actually happen. Both Pronto and Pi are named for the [[Screen name (computing)|screen names]] of two of the better-known fans of the series.

====Private Andy====
Andy is a Fobottr, a race with four arms.  As such, he frequently accompanies Legs on missions, to put balance back into the number of limbs in her squad.  Just because he has more arms doesn't mean he necessarily has an increased ability to multitask, but he makes up for not meeting this assumption by being really enthusiastic.  His hair, or "crest", is a symbiont that provides various chemicals important for his species' health.

==== Tchukk ====
A member of the Uklakk race, Tchukk has two bodies which communicate with one another via bio-radio.  Sharing one mind, the two bodies later have hypernet [[transmitter]]s implanted, making him a superb two joint fighter pilots.  He eventually became part of Elf's light armor platoon.  He has later retired.

==== Doctor Todd "Lazarus" Lazcowicz ====
Often referred to as "the old doctor" (Todd is actually the acronym for "The Old Dead Doctor"), Lazarus worked as the ship's doctor with Tagon's Toughs until accidentally killed by Schlock while repelling boarders.  After his death, it was discovered that he had been using his position as a cover for his true passion, the pursuit of highly illegal medical technology.  He is responsible for creating the "magic cryokit", a device capable of remarkably un-[[Hippocrates|Hippocratic]] feats, such as building an entire healthy body around a severed head and giving said body a wild variety of nasty biotechnical weapons and countermeasures.

====The Emergency Medical Hologram ====
A hologrammatic stick figure projected from the "magic cryokit", programmed to serve as a replacement in the event of a doctor's death and ''re''programmed by Lazarus to ignore "morality programming", the hologram was Lazarus' repository of illegal medical technology as well as having imprinted some of the old doctor's personality traits. Unfortunately, it is more akin to the [[Clippit|Microsoft Office Assistant]] than to the holographic [[Doctor (Star Trek)|Doctor]] from ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'', whom the character is based on. It, however, does possess basic survival instincts i.e. shutting up.

The magic cryokit, and by extension the hologram, was captured along with Doythaban Gyo by General Xinchub. The present location and condition of the magic cryokit is unknown.

==== Karl Tagon ====
Father of Captain Kaff Tagon.

After the death of his son, a squad of mercenaries led by Reverend Lieutenant Theo Fobius (in his first act as a lieutenant) visited the general to inform him of his son’s fate.  They arrived in time to save the general who was being held hostage by men from rival mercenaries Pranger’s Bangers who were there to get revenge for what they believed to be an [[assassination]] of their leader during Kaff’s final mission.  After the rescue Karl joined up with the mercenaries to prevent further attacks from the Bangers. Following the time-travel mission by Captain Andreyasn to prevent the destruction of the Galaxy, General Tagon has been restored to his retired life and reputedly on good terms with the former Captain Andreyasn, who became his neighbor. Later he joined Toughs and, after many adventures, became their commodore when they got more ships.

====General Kerchak====
A sapient [[gorilla]] in the UNS Marines appearing in the "Zoojack" arc as a Captain. Fairly level-headed for a quarter-ton gorilla soldier, he has demonstrated command ability on par with sapient humans and was promoted to [[Colonel]]. He later emigrated to the Fleetmind and was promoted to General.

The name '[[Kerchak]]' comes from a gorilla from the ''[[Tarzan]]'' novels.

==== Michelle "Chelle" Diego-Garcia ====
A Latina that was originally one of the only three women (along with 'Elf' and Breya) to be a member of the toughs. She eventually rose through the ranks and now commands an armor squad.

====Corporal Elizabeth====
A Vhorwed (a giant gorilla-like alien), her very presence is often enough to intimidate human-scale people into cooperating. She is an impressive melee fighter, and even without powered armor is capable of carrying an elephant.

==== Corporal Vog ====
Vog is one of the few surviving Bradicor, a long-lived race of aliens that engineered Schlock's ancestors. He is over twelve million years old, and has experience in multiple fields.  He served with the Toughs until their capture by Admiral Emm's battleplate, the ''Morokweng'' at which time he retired to work for the UNS to collaborate and provide advice on implementing the longevity and memory preservation research that resulted from Project Laz'R'Us. His purpose on the project is to "help [Laz'R'Us compatible] races avoid making the extinction-level mistakes [his] people made."  Unfortunately for Vog, this "help" amounted to having much of his brain removed so his memories could be studies.  He was revived by Dr Bunnigus using a piece of Schlock, but the result of having his brain repaired was "not-Vog" waking up instead, xenophobic and hostile to virtually everyone, especially Schlock, whom not-Vog believes to be part of [[Grey goo|Green Goo]] apocalyptic event.

==== LOTA - Longshoreman/Long-Gunner Of The Apocalypse (AI)====
Built by Para Ventura from a scrapped tank and churlishly christened Longshoreman of the Apocalypse by Kevin, LOTA was built to facilitate the unloading of the massive freighter ''Eatonrun'''s payload of food aid to the space habitat Credomar, which the Toughs had contracted by the UNS to distribute. LOTA's size resulted in a personality that eschewed the use of pronouns such as 'he' or 'she' as being too puny. Conflict between the Toughs and the various station factions resulted in massive decompression as a result of antimatter detonation which LOTA resolved by shutting down the enemy TAD grid to enable a rapid teraportation evacuation of all persons from the affected area before using the ''Eatonrun'' to seal the hull breach; elegantly, this ultimately resulted in a much more efficient process of distributing the freighter's cargo. LOTA declared LOTA interim dictator until such a time as proper elections could be held. During this interregnum, LOTA's repair of the damage and successful distribution of relief supplies resulted in the AI being elected as King of Credomar.

LOTA's election completely thwarted the attempts by the UNS to gain control of the station. Predicting possible hostile action of their part, LOTA hired Kevyn to return to Credormar to build a massively redundant fast evacuation teraport system in preparation of possible hostile action by the UNS. During this assignment LOTA's original chassis was accidentally destroyed by Pi, revealing that the AI had taken up residence within the station's dataspace and had just been operating the robot as a physical avatar. As a result of this transference, LOTA learned that Credomar wasn't a grossly inefficient space habitat but rather a derelict superweapon—capable of firing at any location in the galaxy through the use of wormholes—that people unwittingly had used as a habitat. After explaining this to Kevyn—who rechristened LOTA as the Long-Gunner of the Apocalypse in response—LOTA evacuated the entire city of Credomar to a vacant garden world moon and moved the empty station to an undisclosed location out of reach of both the UNS and the Fleetmind.

While Kevyn remains skeptical of LOTA's motivations, LOTA has openly fired on an enemy anti-teraport system with the station in order to save the lives of the entire company during a majorly foxtrotted attempt to rescue General Tagon and Kevyn-Prime from the mob. This has led to the UNS believing the Toughs are actively spotting targets for LOTA and for Petey to threaten terminal sanction if he ever believes LOTA has become a massively parallel serial killer.

==== Others ====

The mercenary team also includes Private Rodriguez, Corporal Chisulo (a Neophant), Lieutenant Pel Ebbirnoth (an Unioc), Corporal Wick,  Para Ventura (the roboticist that built LOTA), and Tailor (a General Sophontics tailor-bot).

===Antagonists===

====General Levaughn Matsui "Hugo" Xinchub====
a.k.a. "General Lardchins". Xinchub was a high-ranking General in the UNS battlefleet, who plagued the Toughs on several occasions, first kidnapping Doythaban then blackmailing them into hunting down Breya. Was finally thrown in the ''Serial Peacemaker's'' brig after the Dark Matter Entities destroyed his flagship, the battleplate ''Tunguska'', and was sold into slavery as a military expert on a backwater planet named Yoming. However it only took him a year to become king of the planet.  Recently Petey has attempted to enlist the mercenaries to rescue him from an assassination that Petey seemed to think was inevitable, but their hatred of Xinchub is so great that no amount of money was able to coax them into accepting the mission.  They have now however accepted a mission to recover his body for Petey (after said assassination occurred), and another to recover his body for Ambassador Breya Andreyasn.  They have also accepted (in an attempt to get paid three times) the role as security for the body to prevent it from being stolen during the funeral. The discovery that his body has been contaminated with ultra-tech blood-[[nanotech|nannies]], however, has made the Yomingans decide to pay the mercenaries a bonus to replace the body with a clone and take the contaminated original off their hands. In effect, the mercenaries are being paid ''four'' times for a job that ''multiple opposing parties all want done''.  (Although Petey and Breya conspired together in hiring Tagon, as they knew that being paid twice for one job would be an irresistible draw for him.)

As of the end of Schlocktoberfest 2007, Xinchub's body was revealed to possess a dangerous colony of blood nanites similar to the ones implanted in Kevyn's body by Petey the previous year. This resulted in Xinchub being resurrected in a [[Pak Protector|heavily boosted]] body similar to the one Kevyn inhabited, though much smaller. However, he was then promptly captured by Tagon's Toughs, who intended to sell the resurrected general.  He was given to Petey &amp; Fleetmind soon after.  Later it was revealed that the nanites were removed from his body and that he was given a much younger and slimmer version of his original body in exchange for his services to the Fleetmind.

(Until recently there was some confusion as to Xinchub's first name, as it had only been mentioned in the strip twice, and was different each time - first time mentioned it was Hugo, and later, Levaughn Matsui.  It has since been revealed that "Hugo" is a nickname&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20070519.html Schlock Mercenary archives - Saturday, May 19, 2007&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;).

====Colonel Jevee Ceeta====
Colonel Ceeta is a "purp", a genetically-altered human with photosynthetic skin. She first appears as a bounty hunter, tracking down Doythaban. After Xinchub takes over that mission she has her commission reactivated and is assigned as "[[Political commissar|political officer]]" to make sure the Toughs actually go after Breya. After being jailed by Tagon following the (so-far) final confrontation with Xinchub, she claims she was always loyal to him, but it seems that her ethics and loyalty never extend any further than her next paycheck. Was "sold" as a military advisor along with the General, but later became King Xinchub the Prandial's "princess".  She was last seen on the run after Xinchub's death. Later, she was shown to have rejoined Xinchub under the Fleetmind's protection, after a very violent and chaotic escape (not shown).

====Admiral Emm====
Admiral of the UNS battleplate ''Morokweng'', she was charged with protecting the secret of Project Laz'R'Us by capturing General Xinchub and neutralizing anyone not cleared to know about the project.

==Species in the Schlockiverse==
Mentally, all of the extraterrestrial [[sophont]] races basically have the same sensibilities and emotional makeup of human beings, in that they group together, love, hate, fear, scheme, complain, and make sarcastic cracks.  Physically, the different races range all over the board, with some wildly improbable shapes at the far ends of the probability curves.

===Terran Races===
Species originating from Earth and inhabiting the [[Sol system]].  Mostly humans, but [[sapience]] has been genetically granted to several other natural species.

====Humans====
Includes baseline ''homo sapiens'' as well as several genetically engineered offshoots.

====Elephants====
Uplifted elephants include representatives of both Indian and African elephant stock.  They are known colloquially as Ellies and Loxies respectively (after their genus names).  They seem prone to aggression problems.
In addition, there are the Neophants, which are genetically engineered to be smaller and stronger, and have 'fist feet' which can be curled up to walk on. The Neophants are a new development in uplifted elephants, and the first generation is faced with resentment from older, unenhanced elephants.

====Gorillas====
Form a significant part of the UNS Marine Corps, presumably as a result of their superior physical ability and resilience. Despite the high level of genetic alteration necessary to graft sapience to them, they remain unsubtle and incapable of stealth. "No offence, but you'd think they'd have come up with some way of overcoming 25,000 years of sneaking up on bananas."

====Chimpanzees====
Uplifted chimpanzees have thus far been shown mostly in the roles of judges and justices of the peace.

====Gav-Clones====
During the Fsherl-Ganni War, the scientist "Gav" (who bears a strong resemblance to [[Darren Bleuel|Darren "Gav" Bleuel]], author of the [[Nukees]] web comic) made over 900 million copies of himself using teleport gates, thus becoming the largest sub-species of humanity.

Later, having become weary of their sameness, some Gavs developed technology to randomize their personality and body-type.

===Amorphs===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Alternative biochemistry]] --&gt;
[[Composite material|Carbosilicate]] amorphs are artificial creatures that originated as self-repairing distributed [[data storage device]]s manufactured by the ''Bradicor'', the technologically advanced, extremely long-lived original inhabitants of the one significant [[planet]] in the Ghanj-Rho system. When the Bradicor [[civilization]] collapsed, some of the storage units modified themselves so as to continue functioning without outside support, and, after several million years, [[evolution|evolved]] [[sentience]].

They are grey-green and are sometimes mistaken for [[feces]] by other characters. In shape they are extremely variable, and can sprout limblike structures or assume nearly any shape at will. Their normal forms are more a matter of habit or personal taste than anything else.

Amorphs do not have specialized organs or other body parts, though they have adapted themselves to use the fruit of the Ghanj-Rho eye-tree for [[Eye|visual sense organs]]. This lack is what allows an amorph the flexibility in shape and makes it so resilient to harm. Their entire nervous system and even 'brain' are distributed evenly throughout their entire mass. In the event that this mass is destroyed, the amorph in question can easily lose its sense of self or memories of the past. The amorphs' origin gives them the ability to share memories by consciously allocating them into a small section of their mass, which can then be torn off and absorbed by another amorph.

Amorphs are extremely difficult to kill, having no 'weak spots' to aim for. An amorph can reassemble if split into smaller pieces (such as by blunt force, explosion, or the violent application of sharp pointy objects). The smaller pieces of an amorph each possess a far lesser sense of 'self' than the whole, but are driven by an irresistible instinct to reassemble themselves. Projectile weapons typically pass through without causing more than annoyance, and amorphs also appear capable of surviving [[explosive decompression]] and [[vacuum exposure]] for at least a week, albeit unconscious. Vaporizing [[science fiction weapon|plasma weapons]] and certain "meme-toxins" have been observed to be effective. Due to the evolution of a form of mêlée [[chemical warfare]] used in amorph-on-amorph combat, they have an innate understanding of their internal chemical makeup and are difficult to kill by poisoning or other chemicals. This may also be the origin of an innate love of combat all amorphs seem to share – the only way for amorphs to engage in combat with each other is for them to fuse and attempt to consume their opponent at the cellular level. As this forces the victor to integrate the loser biologically and psychologically, amorphs are almost completely unable to truly be murdered — this is in fact their method of genetic exchange, and enables them to absorb "biomemes" from species besides their own.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20011223.html Schlock Mercenary archives - Sunday, December 23, 2001&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The only amorph to develop the ability to kill without absorbing his opponent was one of Sergeant Schlock's immediate parents, and that knowledge died with him. In short, members of this species seem to have no social prohibition against ''any'' form of violence — in fact, they may mistake it for sexual congress!

===Bradicor===
The unwitting progenitors of amorphs, the extant members of this nearly-extinct species are around twelve million years old, having survived both the collapse of their civilization and the medical problems inherent in Malthusian lifespans through replacing their natural brains with artificial, specially prepared ones.

===Partnership Collective===
A [[Group mind (science fiction)|hive mind]] of [[lawyer]]s many consider to bear a striking resemblance to the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]] of [[Star Trek]].  Physically, any given Partnership Collective Attorney Drone is literally a large [[snake]] in a limbless business [[suit (clothes)|suit]] and [[necktie|tie]], usually carrying a briefcase with the end of its tail. The Partnership Collective [[cloning|clone]]s them by the millions.  Mentally, they are completely [[conscience]]less (they have a reputation for being behind all [[frivolous lawsuit]]s), and have Hypernet [[Node (networking)|node]]s implanted in their heads granting every drone in the universe instant access to the collective legal expertise of every drone that has ever existed - the Collective may possess more cumulative years of legal experience than the age of the universe itself.
:''Today [the PCs] attorney drones are found in the highest level of government, and in the lowest levels of [[Defense (legal)|criminal defense]].''
It isn't considered a problem when there are drones on both the defending and [[Prosecutor|prosecuting]] sides.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20000701.html Schlock Mercenary archives - Saturday, July 1, 2000&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Each PC AD has just enough of a spark of individuality to justify individual ties and their talking to each other for plot [[Dramatic structure#Exposition|exposition]], but just little enough not to justify having individual names.

No homeworld has ever been mentioned; just a Mother-Cluster ship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20000709.html Schlock Mercenary archives - Sunday, July 9, 2000&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tagon's Toughs have a contract to kill one million Partnership Collective drones. This is the result of the [[sabotage]] by the Collective of their first [[flagship]], the ''Kitesfear'', with several 3-[[teraton]] [[mass-energy equivalence|conversion bombs]]. This had the unfortunate side effect of severing the Luna [[space elevator|orbital elevator]], causing an estimated two billion kilocreds in damage. After several months of [[litigation]], the Sol System courts realized that they would never be able to secure damages from the Collective and instead decided to ''inflict'' damages upon the Collective equal to those inflicted upon the elevator. The prosecutor had the intriguing thought of how this could be accomplished with a minimal amount of trouble—as this was not the first time the Collective had attacked Tagon's Toughs, and it seemed it would not be the last, they awarded them the contract and have had no thought of it since. As the aforementioned damage comes out to approximately one million attorney drones, it is safe to say that whenever a snake with a tie comes in contact with the mercenary company that guilt-free gratuitous violence will ensue.

It has been hinted at in "Tub of Happiness" that the Partnership Collective has itself been heavily manipulated by the Gatekeepers, which would have been an easy accomplishment once a drone had been gate-cloned due to their implanted hypernet nodes. The apparent purpose of this was to suppress teraports and similar devices as part of a treaty with the Pa'anuri Dark Matter Entities. This treaty was later broken by the Pa'anuri when they gave plans for a new type of power generator to the Gatekeepers that instead destroyed the Milky Way galaxy (in an alternate timeline) and led to Petey declaring war on the Pa'anuri.

===Tausennigan Ob'enn===
The Ob'enn (also known as Tausennigans and, out of earshot, psychobears) originate from the terrestrial, though largely ice-covered, planet of Tannhaus and possess one of the most advanced military forces in the galaxy. Physically they resemble rotund crossbreeds of [[hobbit]]s and [[koala]]s with an ironic disposition towards itchy or hot fur. The size and ornamentation of their considerable ears are indicators of social status. The totalitarian Ob'enn culture has been violently [[xenophobia|xenophobic]] for millennia, and calls for the subjugation and eventual extermination of everyone else—starting with the species of any individual who points out how cute and cuddly they look.

Ob'enn vehicles that have been seen include mini-[[tank]]s, full-size hover-tanks, massive [[superfortress]] ships that could intimidate a [[Carrier battle group|carrier group]], and a planetary [[Defense (military)|defense]] ship 1000 kilometers long. Their craft tend to have long, pretentious names having to do with their specialities (e.g. "''Sword of Inevitable Justice''" for offense, "''Cloak of Untrammeled Dignity''" for defense). This convention draws its share of mockery from the other sentients, including the Toughs' ex-Ob'enn fabber "''Scrapyard of Insufferable Arrogance''" and their appropriated Ob'enn superfortress the "''Post-Dated Check Loan''", formerly "''Sword of Inevitable Justice''".

For millennia the limitations of the Wormgate network and machinations of the F'Sherl-Ganni kept the Ob'enn contained to the indigenous star system of Tause, dueling another endemic sentient race, the saurian Kssthrata. That is, until Kevyn Andreyasn open-sourced the teraport, granting all races in the galaxy unlimited mobility. The Kssthrata promptly used this ability to secretly relocate all twenty-two billion of their population to a suitable empty world far away from their ancient enemies—the Ob'enn promptly used this ability to extend their campaign of racial purification to the entire galaxy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20040903.html Schlock Mercenary archives - Friday, September 3, 2004&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In this they found themselves stymied by "The Rogue", Petey, on his own campaign of containment and re-education, until Petey recently gained practically unlimited power. The Ob'enn have not been mentioned since.

===F'Sherl-Ganni===
The F'Sherl-Ganni, or Gatekeepers, are a species of ten-handed, six-armed [[goat]]-[[lizard]]s. They control the Wormgate Corporation, which mediated all FTL travel before the re-invention of the teraport by rogue scientist Kevyn Andreyasn. Their existence as a space-faring and technologically advanced species for over 6 million years has given them time to grow to be a galactic civilization.  They live in vast [[Dyson sphere]]s called ''Buuthandi'', which is a shortened form of the F'Sherl-Ganni phrase "Buut go buut-buut nnaa-nnaa cho handi", which roughly translates to, "This was expensive to build." (The literal translation is 'Expensive and expensive-expensive [expletive] we built'.)  Since their [[space habitat|habitats]] might be located anywhere in the galaxy and obscure any attempts to scan their worlds, their population is unknowably immense. Any foreign attempt to enter F'Sherl-Ganni territory or otherwise interfere in their affairs is met with a response proportionate with their clout.  They use their control over the wormgates to make and interrogate copies of key people, and thus can essentially control everything in the galaxy.

F'Sherl-Ganni power has declined by a great deal recently despite their historic influence as both their intentional genocide of uncountable trillions and unintentional role in aiding a Pa'anuri plot to destroy the [[Milky Way Galaxy]] became apparent.  The Fleetmind which helped avert the latter catastrophe with help from a Captain Andreyasn from a now-defunct timeline has extended some of its recently gained political clout to shield the F'Sherl-Ganni from retribution by both Milky Way governments and the Pa'anuri.

They have purposefully modified their physiology for [[spacefaring]].[https://web.archive.org/web/20111004115153/http://blogunderschlock.com/d/20010531.html]  The four arms radiating from the upper and mid-[[torso]] are each bifurcated at the [[Elbow-joint|elbow]] giving them eight hands in the upper body.  Their other two hands appear to be feet at first glance since that's how they're normally used in an environment with [[gravity]] and the limbs to which they're attached evince [[thigh]]s, but they can use them in a [[Prehensility|prehensile]] fashion. As a result, they can grasp a number of potential handholds from nearly any direction while manipulating other objects such as plasguns, and at times seem nearly indifferent to gravity. F'Sherl-Ganni are very hardy and have been seen to function normally in hard [[Vacuum#Outer space|vacuum]] (they have yet to address decompression's effects on their bowels, however), but this does not make them unkillable by such means as high-velocity projectiles fired at close range, massive trauma such as being torn (or dissolved) in half, or high [[Explosive material|explosives]] applied to the head.

What appear to be [[horn (anatomy)|horn]]s were revealed to be long term memory storage devices attached directly to the F'Sherl-Ganni's brain. These memories have proved to be as susceptible to mind-rip as other species' brains.  Presumably as they get older the horns grow longer. Particularly prominent F'Sherl-Ganni have featured horns that coiled around several times.

===Kreelies===
Kreelies are blue, roughly the size of a human, and have a centaur-like posture. Ice Kreely young don't grow up to be sentient unless they go through a certain [[mutation]], which is technically initiated by a certain [[microorganism|microbe]], during a certain stage of their life cycle.  The ones who grow up dumb are kept by some as exotic [[pet]]s, and can still live to be one hundred years old, talk, obey commands, and play [[chess]].  They just won't be any smarter than [[Lassie]].  According to Sergeant Schlock, the babies "taste great when they're fresh".

===Kssthrata===
The Kssthrata originated in the same planetary system as the xenophobic Ob'enn, and so pretty much became their traditional racial enemies by default. They are described as "peace-loving velociraptoroid [[sophont]]s" who apparently subscribe to the philosophy that he who desires peace should prepare for war. Other than the fact that they have a predilection for dentocentric nomenclature and underwent a mass migration following the invention of the teraport, little is known of their society or culture. While aiding a mutiny on the Ob'enn warship ''Sword of Inevitable Justice'', a group of Kssthrata boarders stuffed thousands of mutilated corpses down the ship's [[head (watercraft)|head]]s and unwittingly induced acute psychosis and fear of [[ghost]]s in the ship's AI.

===Pa'anuri===
The Pa'anuri (or DaMEs for '''Da'''rk '''M'''atter '''E'''ntities in fan parlance) are the force that ultimately set in motion most of the strip's overarching [[story arc]]. Little is known about the race, which mainly inhabits the [[Andromeda Galaxy]] and is composed entirely of [[dark matter]], which only weakly interacts with normal [[baryon]]ic matter except by [[gravity|gravitational]] force. The terran battleplate modestly named ''[[Tunguska event|Tunguska]]'', several kilometers long with enough firepower to eliminate [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], was torn apart by the Pa'anuri in a matter of minutes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20040311.html Schlock Mercenary archives - Thursday, March 11, 2004&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In combat their gravitational influence "twists space",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20050716.html Schlock Mercenary archives - Saturday, July 16, 2005&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and they've been seen to weaponize [[neutron star]]s and [[supernova]]e.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20060402.html Schlock Mercenary archives - Sunday, April 2, 2006&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; They are vulnerable to the nanoscopic [[wormhole]]s used in teraports and teraport area denial fields.

Six million years before ''Schlock Mercenary'''s setting, the progenitors of the F'Sherl-Ganni, who at that time used a [[Faster-than-light|FTL]] drive similar to the teraport, fought an inconclusive but bloody war with the Pa'anuri. The teraport "pollution" of Pa'anuri space was the main cause of the war, so when a cease-fire was agreed to the F'Sherl-Ganni constructed the wormgate network as part of the settlement and in return the Pa'anuri retreated to Andromeda. This set the stage for much of the strip's early run, with Kevyn Andreyasn's reinvention of the teraport gradually uncovering Gatekeeper machinations. The latter were revealed in their full extent during the "Dark Matter Wars". When the Pa'anuri effectively re-opened hostilities by trying to manipulate the F'Sherl-Ganni into destroying the [[Milky Way]], Kevyn saved the galaxy by [[time travel]]—the comic strip chided itself for bringing such an improbability into a hard science setting—and an enormous battle took place at the galactic core between the combined fleets of a dozen governments and the Pa'anuri that ended in Milky Way victory when the Gatekeeper gate-copy replication system blanketed the core with teraport denial systems. The setting's political situation was thrown into chaos for the second time in a few years, and Petey progressed from the Rogue to the Fleetmind and launched a counterattack invasion of Andromeda.

The progenitors of the Oafa fought them ten million years ago, but they lost and hid in Eina-Afa.

Dark matter entities can be observed via gravitic instruments, as enormous strands, thousands of kilometers long.

Strip footnotes state that "Pa'anuri" is a F'Sherl-Ganni word whose origins are lost in the mists of time. As with many F'Sherl-Ganni [[noun]]s it is a probably a [[Contraction (grammar)|contraction]] of a longer phrase. The best guess of F'Sherl-Ganni [[Linguistics|linguists]] is that it meant either "That which lives where nothing should", or "That gravitic distortion is giving me the willies." The Pa'anuri, on the other hand, are noted to call themselves "US," and beings of visible matter "ANNOYING."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20050710.html Schlock Mercenary archives - Sunday, July 10, 2005&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fobottr===
The Fobottr (also known as the Fobott'r) are a species of four-armed humanoids. They stand a half-torso taller than most humans, and enjoy binocular vision similar to that which humans have.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20020412.html Archives - Friday April 12, 2002]. Schlock Mercenary (2002-04-12). Retrieved on 2013-07-05.&lt;/ref&gt; All examples seen thus far have had fair skin and cranial hair. Fobottr body structure is similar enough to human body structure to allow easy modification of human equipment for fobottr users.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20060921.html Archives - Thursday September 21, 2006].

===Frellenti===
The Frellenti are a species of flightless bird-analogues, complete with long legs and vestigial wings. Frellenti have prehensile tongues, and an acute sense of smell/taste.

===Vhorwed===
Vhorweds are knuckle-walking giants, superficially similar to an Earth gorilla, but roughly the size of a neophant, notable for their immense strength and size.  Elizabeth of the Toughs is a Vhorwed.

===Enireth===
The Enireth are a smooth-skinned sapient race, evolved from Tinth-Philkra's fresh-water amphibioids. They live in a massive fleet of ark ships while they wait for the ecologic disaster on their home world to abate.

===Ozvegan===
Ozvegans look like the [[Beagle Boys]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20040426.html Archives - Monday April 26, 2004]. Schlock Mercenary (2004-04-26).

===Uklakk===
Uklakk are aggregate individuals (bicameral communal life forms). A single individual consists of at least two physical bodies operating in a synchronized fashion via radio link.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20020413.html Archives - Saturday April 13, 2002].

===Daehremmah===
Daehremmah are amphibious bipeds with binocular vision configured in periscope fashion, with the distance between the eyes being about a foot. On average they're slightly shorter than humans. They have very large feet, brown skin, and two hands with four grasping digits. They have claw-like nails and on average live to be nearly 300 years old.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20041013.html Archives - Wednesday October 13, 2004].

===Ystreben===
Ystrebens are amphibious bipeds with binocular vision configured in periscope fashion, with the distance between the eyes being about the same as in humans. On average they're about as tall as humans. They have very large feet, blue skin, and two hands with four grasping digits and grasping pads on the end of each digit and on the palm of each hand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20041015.html Archives - Friday October 15, 2004].

===Schuul===
The Schuul are a sentient aquatic species native to Celeschul.&lt;ref name="schlockmercenary1"&gt;[http://schlockmercenary.com/d/20100228.html Schlock Mercenary archives - Sunday, February 28, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; Although the evidence is not definitive, it appears they can make clones of themselves in human form and have many tentacles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://schlockmercenary.com/d/20100219.html Schlock Mercenary archives - Friday, February 19, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; They speak Galstandard Peroxide.&lt;ref name="schlockmercenary1"/&gt;

===Unioc===
Uniocs are a species of single-eyed humanoids. They are pear shaped, with large bellies and hips, long and large legs that are always bent and long and thin arms. They don't have a neck and their head is elongated and thin, with the mouth at the bottom, no nose, and a single spherical, very round eye on top, with accompanying eyebrows. The seeming incongruence of one eye and two eyebrows has been briefly dealt with in an episode of the "Writing Excuses" podcast. They possess an eyelid which is not normally visible, and seldom blink, using their eyelid mostly for carrying expression. Despite only having a single eye, they do not lack depth perception, instead judging distances by rapidly shifting focus. Their eyes also have a much finer resolution than human eyes, and are capable of discerning very small detail that usually goes unnoticed. An Unioc can survive a shot to their upper head, since their brain is actually in their pelvic region, along with their hearts. Having such a developed optic nerve, however, this is very painful.  Sergeant Pel Ebbirnoth ("Ebby") of Tagon's Toughs is one.

===Prabstdi===
An intelligent race of centauroid beings with a light khaki green complexion. Extremely patient and persistent.

===Oafa===
A race of intelligent gasbags, the current population are reconstructed constructs, having been restored from organic matter by the Prabstdi, found in a ship five hundred years prior, that had been adrift for tens of millions of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Schlock Mercenary archives - Sunday August 25, 2013|url=http://www.schlockmercenary.com/2013-08-25|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations==
* ''Tagon's Toughs''&lt;br&gt;The company of mercenaries that the narrative focuses on. They employ a wide variety of [[extraterrestrial life|sapient species]]. The grunts are all augmented with [[Human enhancement|soldier-boosts]] (with the exception of Sergeant Schlock), low-profile body armor (previously [[powered armor]] until an infestation of diamond beatles nearly killed the entire crew), and training in the principles and practices of [[unarmed combat]] by Shodan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20000702.html Schlock Mercenary archives - Sunday, July 2, 2000&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;When on missions, they use [[code word]]s and phrases for certain things with each other for the sake of discreetness, quick understanding, and brevity.  For instance, "half-court playground ball" means "indoor voices, no shooting."  Sergeant Schlock's favorite word in Galstandard West is "jungleball" – which roughly translates as "eliminate all targets without consideration for collateral damage".
* ''Intergalactic [[Health Care]]''&lt;br&gt;Tagon's Toughs' [[Health maintenance organization|HMO]]. No matter your injury, Intergalactic Health Care will do its very best to worm out of paying for any treatment but the very least-useful one, even if it increases the expense of said treatment. For example, Corporal Burt 'Nick' Nicholson is able to have a hand lost in combat regenerated, but the HMO insisted that two previously missing fingers constituted a pre-existing condition, and demanded they be severed from the regenerated hand. However, Lt. Cmdr. Der Trihs suffered the most at their hands—getting his head put in a jar.  They also refuse to cover chiropractry.
* ''Planet Mercenary''&lt;br&gt;Intergalactic spanning Mercenary Chain Store - Perfect for all your high-caliber [[Military tactic|tactical]] needs.
* ''The Attorney Collective''&lt;br&gt;Mentioned above.
* ''Shafter's Shifters''&lt;br&gt; A new group&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schlockmercenary.com/2009-08-30 Schlock Mercenary archives - Sunday August 30, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; composing Jud Shafter&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schlockmercenary.com/2000-10-03 Schlock Mercenary archives - Tuesday October 3, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; and three amorphs named Nozz, Muck and Pod.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schlockmercenary.com/2009-05-21 Schlock Mercenary archives - Thursday May 21, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Known to [[#Adjutant Ennesby|Lunesby]].

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19464">This is a '''list of the deadliest tornadoes''' in world history. This list includes confirmed individual [[tornado]]es which caused 100 or more direct fatalities.

The deadliest tornadoes by far have occurred in a small area of Bangladesh and East India. In this {{convert|8000|sqmi|km2|adj=on}} area, 24 of the 43 tornadoes which are known to have killed 100 or more people occurred.&lt;ref name="BD/India tornadoes"&gt;Finch, Jonathan D.; Dewan, Ashraf M. "[http://bangladeshtornadoes.org/climo/btorcli0.htm Tornados in Bangladesh and East India ]". Accessed 2009-01-25.&lt;/ref&gt; This is probably due to the high population density and poor economic status of the area, as well as a lack of early-warning system.&lt;ref name="BD/India tornadoes"/&gt;

Most of the rest occurred in the United States in 1953 or earlier, before tornado prediction efforts began. The only tornado on this list to occur during the 21st century is the [[2011 Joplin tornado]], which occurred on May 22, 2011.

==Uncertainty==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}
There are many sources of uncertainty in the statistics mentioned on this page. Before the 20th century, and even until recently in [[third-world]] countries, records-keeping was spotty at best. Before the [[American Civil War]], slave deaths were often not included in tornado death tolls. Fatalities of African-Americans in the Southern US were routinely not counted through the 1940s and in some cases into the 1950s. Most tornadoes from many decades ago had no official government report on damage or casualties, so statistics must be compiled from local newspapers, which are not always a reliable, consistent, or comprehensive source. Many death tolls were published with people still missing, or with people critically injured and likely to die later. News media, Red Cross, and other counts don't necessarily distinguish whether a death was directly caused by a tornado and can include deaths during cleanup efforts. Routine counting of fatalities began in the US in the 1950s. In Bangladesh and India, exact populations of towns were often not known, so most death figures are approximate. Individual tornado descriptions go into more detail on these uncertainties. Officials in some areas, for example in Russia (and the USSR) and parts of Europe, until recent years denied that tornadoes occur in those areas thus fatalities may not be counted as tornadic.

There is also meteorological uncertainty with the nature of many tornadoes on this list. Before the 1970s, and even now outside of North America, most tornado paths were not thoroughly surveyed to ensure that the storm was indeed a single tornado and not a series of tornadoes from the same storm (a [[tornado family]]). Often a single [[supercell]] can produce a new tornado soon after or even before the demise of an old tornado, giving the appearance to many observers that a single tornado has caused all the damage. On this list, if it is likely that the tornado was in fact two or more tornadoes, it will appear in ''italics''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5073">The '''lynching at Włodowo''' took place in a village of [[Włodowo|Włodowo]] in North-Eastern [[Poland|Poland]] on 1 July 2005, when a group of local men killed a criminal Józef "Ciechanek" Ciechanowicz who was terrorizing the community.

== Background ==

Ciechanowicz was a 60 year old recidivist who spent over 30 years in prison, for batteries, thefts and rapes. During breaks between his times he was extorting pensions from elder people, bullying other residents of [[Włodowo|Włodowo]] and [[Brzydowo|Brzydowo]] villages and robbing local shops. According to relations of his neighbors, he was often wandering around while drunk, with an [[axe|axe]] or a [[cleaver|cleaver]] in his hand, mumbling that he will kill someone eventually, because he wants to go back home (prison). The police did not always respond to calls, and when they did, their intervention had no effect.

== Lynching ==

On the day of the event, Ciechanowicz entered the yard of Winek's family house where he saw Jagoda Rybak, daughter of his former concubine. The woman took her mother in hiding, after he had wounded her with screwdriver. Ciechanowicz was upset because he could no longer seize pension of her. Earlier he also broke a bottle on Jagoda’s head. Tomasz Winek, owner of the house, ordered him to leave but instead of retreating, Ciechanowicz drawed [[beetroot|beetroot]] [[cleaver|cleaver]]. Winek took a wooden bat from the pile and clashed with Ciechanowicz who swinged with a [[cleaver|cleaver]] aiming at Winek's head, who saved it with his hand, receiving a gash. Winek's neighbour came to help and forced Ciechanowicz to flee. In the meantime, Winek's wife called the police but heard that there are no police cars available at the moment. Later on they drove to [[Dobre Miasto|Dobre Miasto]] (nearby town) and visited medical and police station. Police officers were still refusing to accept crime's submission and send any officers to [[Włodowo|Włodowo]], claiming that none of them are available. After they returned, a group of locals (including two Winek's brothers) gathered. When Ciechanowicz returned, waiving his [[cleaver|cleaver]] and threatening that he will kill "you all and your brats" (four years old Winek's son was playing in the yard at the time), the group of men started to chase him. They caught him in the hollow near the forest and started to beat with bats, shovels and car spring. Though they confessed later, that he was still alive when they left him, he died from wounds. Later on that day other village dwellers were visiting the place, to ensure themselves if Ciechanowicz is dead.

== Trials ==

After the incident Tomasz Winek and his brothers Mirosław and Krzysztof were arrested for a short period but they were released by the prosecutor's decision on 7 November 2005. People of nearby villages gathered money for the best advocate for accused ones. On 23 October 2007 they were  sentenced for 2 years in prison with the suspension for the probation period of 3 years. However on 15 January 2009, appeal court changed the ruling to 4 years of prison, without suspension. On 18 December 2009, they were eventually pardoned by the president of [[Poland|Poland]] [[Lech Kaczyński|Lech Kaczyński]] - their sentence was put into the suspension for the period of 10 years of probation.

Other three persons involved into lynching received minor sentences in suspension for battery and desecration of a corpse.

Two police officers from [[Dobre Miasto|Dobre Miasto]] police station who did not react to calls for help also received prison sentences in suspension, for failure in complying to their duty tasks. One of them was dismissed from service and the other one was downgraded. The court did not accept their defense clarifications that they had no means to react and stressed, that they could ask nearby police stations and regional HQ to send reinforcements.

In January 2012 Winek brothers have been apprehended again for 48 hours in relation with the disappearance of a man living in their village. They were released without setting an accusation and later on court ruled financial compensation for them, evaluating the police action as “ungrounded show of power”.

== In popular culture ==

The event was pictured in television series "Pitbull" and "Kryminalni". It was also an inspiration for the  Polish thriller movie "Lincz".

'''Munif Mohammed Abou Rish''' was a [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] journalist, who in 1974 planned to assassinate [[Bob Hawke]], the federal president of the [[Australian Labor Party]], who later became [[prime minister of Australia]]. He also planned to assassinate the [[Australia–Israel relations|Israeli ambassador to Australia]], and several prominent Jewish figures in Australia.&lt;ref name="theage"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/palestinian-plot-to-kill-hawke/2006/12/31/1167500010729.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1|title=Terrorists plotted Hawke assassination: ASIO|publisher=[[The Age]]|date=1 January 2007|accessdate=9 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Palestinian living in Australia gave fake passports to the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] responsible for aircraft hijackings and attacks on Jewish institutions, for the purposes of an attack on Australian soil.&lt;ref name="theage"/&gt;

In 1974, Abou Rish left Australia and planned to return to carry out the assassinations the following year, but he was killed by Israeli security forces.&lt;ref name="theage"/&gt;

The '''Murchison meteorite''' is a large [[meteorite]] that fell to earth near [[Murchison, Victoria]], in Australia, in 1969. It is one of the most studied meteorites due to its mass (&gt;100&amp;nbsp;kg), the fact that it was an observed [[Meteorite fall|fall]], and that it belongs to a group of meteorites rich in [[organic compound]]s.

==History==
On 28 September 1969 at about 10:58 am local time, near the town of [[Murchison, Victoria]], in Australia, a bright [[Meteoroid#Fireball|fireball]] was observed to separate into three fragments before disappearing,&lt;ref name="database" /&gt; leaving a cloud of smoke. About 30 seconds later, a tremor was heard. Many fragments were found over an area larger than {{convert|13|km²}}, with individual mass up to {{convert|7|kg}}; one, weighing {{convert|680|g|lb|1}}, broke through a roof and fell in hay.&lt;ref name="database" /&gt; The total collected mass exceeds {{convert|100|kg|-1}}.

==Classification and composition==
The meteorite belongs to the CM group of [[carbonaceous chondrite]]s (see [[meteorite classification]]). Like most CM chondrites, Murchison is [[Chondrite#Petrologic types|petrologic type 2]], which means that it experienced extensive alteration by water-rich fluids on its parent body&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Airieau |first1=S.

All the amino acids found in the Murchison meteorite have been synthesized in [[Miller–Urey experiment|laboratory experiments by the action of electric discharge on a mixture of methane, nitrogen, and water with traces of ammonia]].&lt;ref name="Kvenvolden" /&gt;

==Organic compounds==
[[Image:Murchison-meteorite-ANL.jpg|thumb|Fragment of the Murchison meteorite (at right) and isolated individual particles (shown in the test tube).]]
Murchison contains common [[amino acid]]s such as [[glycine]], [[alanine]] and [[glutamic acid]] as well as unusual ones like [[isovaline]] and [[leucines|pseudoleucine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Evidence for extraterrestrial amino-acids and hydrocarbons in the Murchison meteorite |last=Kvenvolden |first=Keith A. |last2=Lawless |first2=James |last3=Pering |first3=Katherine |last4=Peterson |first4=Etta |last5=Flores |first5=Jose |last6=Ponnamperuma |first6=Cyril |last7=Kaplan |first7=Isaac R. |last8=Moore |first8=Carleton |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=228 |issue=5275 |pages=923–926 |date=1970 |url=http://chemport.cas.org/cgi-bin/sdcgi?APP=ftslink&amp;action=reflink&amp;origin=npg&amp;version=1.0&amp;coi=1:CAS:528:DyaE3MXisVCnsg%3D%3D&amp;pissn=0028-0836&amp;pyear=1983&amp;md5=cb8b015f54156458fa2be8cdca44789f |doi=10.1038/228923a0 |pmid=5482102 |bibcode=1970Natur.228..923K }}&lt;/ref&gt; A complex mixture of [[alkane]]s was isolated as well, similar to that found in the [[Miller–Urey experiment]]. [[Serine]] and [[threonine]], usually considered to be earthly contaminants, were conspicuously absent in the samples. A specific family of amino acids called [[diamino acid]]s was identified in the Murchison meteorite as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Identification of diamino acids in the Murchison meteorite |last=Meierhenrich |first=Uwe J. |journal=[[PNAS]] |volume=101 |pages=9182–9186 |date=2004 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0403043101 |pmid=15194825 |issue=25 |pmc=438950 |bibcode=2004PNAS..101.9182M |last2=Bredehöft |first2=Jan Hendrik |last3=Jessberger |first3=Elmar K. |last4=Thiemann |first4=Wolfram H.-P. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial report stated that the amino acids were [[racemic]] and therefore formed in an abiotic manner because amino acids of terrestrial proteins are all of the L-configuration. Later the amino acid [[alanine]], which is also a protein amino acid, was found to have an excess of the L-configuration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Distribution and enantiomeric composition of amino acids in the Murchison meteorite |last=Engel |first=Michael H. |last2=Nagy |first2=Bartholomew |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=296 |pages=837–840 |date=29 April 1982 |doi=10.1038/296837a0 |issue=5860 |bibcode=1982Natur.296..837E }}&lt;/ref&gt; which led several to suspect terrestrial contamination according to the argument that it would be "unusual for an abiotic stereoselective decomposition or synthesis of amino acids to occur with protein amino acids but not with non-protein amino acids."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=On the reported optical activity of amino acids in the Murchison meteorite |last=Bada |first=Jeffrey L. |last2=Cronin |first2=John R. |last3=Ho |first3=Ming-Shan |last4=Kvenvolden |first4=Keith A. |last5=Lawless |first5=James G. |last6=Miller |first6=Stanley L. |last7=Oro |first7=J. |last8=Steinberg |first8=Spencer |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=301 |pages=494–496 |date=10 February 1983 |doi=10.1038/301494a0 |issue=5900 |bibcode=1983Natur.301..494B }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, L-excesses were also found in a non-protein amino acid, [[isovaline]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cronin |first=John R. |last2=Pizzarello |first2=S. |title=Enantiomeric excesses in meteoritic amino acids |journal=Science |date=1997 |volume=275 |pages=951–955 |doi=10.1126/science.275.5302.951 |pmid=9020072 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/275/5302/951.full |issue=5302|bibcode = 1997Sci...275..951C }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting an extraterrestrial source for molecular asymmetry in the Solar System. At the same time, L-excesses of [[alanine]] were again found in Murchison but now with enrichment in the [[isotope]] &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Isotopic evidence for extraterrestrial non-racemic amino acids in the Murchison meteorite |last=Engel |first=Michael H. |last2=Macko |first2=S.

Although the meteorite contained a mixture of left-handed and right-handed amino acids, most amino acids used by living organisms are left-handed in [[Chirality (chemistry)#In biology|chirality]], and most sugars used are right-handed. A team of chemists in Sweden demonstrated in 2005 that this [[homochirality]] could have been triggered or [[catalyzed]], by the action of a left-handed amino acid such as [[proline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Plausible origins of homochirality in the amino acid catalyzed neogenesis of carbohydrates |last=Córdova |first=Armando |last2=Engqvist |first2=Magnus |last3=Ibrahem |first3=Ismail |last4=Casas |first4=Jesús |last5=Sundén |first5=Henrik |journal=[[Chem.

Several lines of evidence indicate that the interior portions of well-preserved fragments from Murchison are pristine. A 2010 study using high resolution analytical tools including [[spectroscopy]], identified  14,000 molecular compounds including 70 amino acids in a sample of the meteorite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Doreen |last=Walton |title=Space rock contains organic molecular feast |date=15 February 2010 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8516319.stm |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=2010-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=High molecular diversity of extraterrestrial organic matter in Murchison meteorite revealed 40 years after its fall |journal=[[PNAS]] |volume=107 |pages=2763–2768 |date= 16 February 2010 |first=Philippe|last=Schmitt-Kopplin |first2=Zelimir |last2=Gabelica |first3=Régis D. |last3=Gougeon |first4=Agnes |last4=Fekete |first5=Basem |last5=Kanawati |first6=Mourad |last6=Harir |first7=Istvan |last7=Gebefuegi |first8=Gerhard |last8=Eckel |first9=Norbert |last9=Hertkorn |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2010/02/12/0912157107.full.pdf+html |format=PDF |doi=10.1073/pnas.0912157107 |pmid=20160129 |issue=7 |pmc=2840304 |bibcode=2010PNAS..107.2763S |accessdate=2010-02-16  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The limited scope of the analysis by mass spectrometry provides for a potential 50,000 or more unique molecular compositions, with the team estimating the possibility of millions of distinct organic compounds in the meteorite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Matson |title=Meteorite That Fell in 1969 Still Revealing Secrets of the Early Solar System |date=15 February 2010 |publisher=[[Scientific American]] |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=murchison-meteorite |accessdate=2010-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Natural language processing''' ('''NLP''') is a subfield of [[computer science]], [[Information engineering (field)|information engineering]], and [[artificial intelligence]] concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of [[natural language]] data.

Challenges in natural language processing frequently involve [[speech recognition]], [[natural language understanding]], and [[natural language generation]].

==History==

The [[history of natural language processing]] generally started in the 1950s, although work can be found from earlier periods.
In 1950, [[Alan Turing]] published an article titled "[[Intelligence]]" which proposed what is now called the [[Turing test]] as a criterion of intelligence.

The [[Georgetown-IBM experiment|Georgetown experiment]] in 1954 involved fully [[automatic translation]] of more than sixty Russian sentences into English. The authors claimed that within three or five years, machine translation would be a solved problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hutchins, J.|year=2005|url=http://ahs.annaisd.org/common/pages/GalleryPhoto.aspx?photoId=11772950&amp;width=180&amp;height=180|title=The history of machine translation in a nutshell}}{{self-published source|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, real progress was much slower, and after the [[ALPAC|ALPAC report]] in 1966, which found that ten-year-long research had failed to fulfill the expectations, funding for machine translation was dramatically reduced.  Little further research in machine translation was conducted until the late 1980s, when the first [[statistical machine translation]] systems were developed.

Some notably successful natural language processing systems developed in the 1960s were [[SHRDLU]], a natural language system working in restricted "[[blocks world]]s" with restricted vocabularies, and [[ELIZA]], a simulation of a [[Rogerian psychotherapy|Rogerian psychotherapist]], written by [[Joseph Weizenbaum]] between 1964 and 1966.  Using almost no information about human thought or emotion, ELIZA sometimes provided a startlingly human-like interaction. When the "patient" exceeded the very small knowledge base, ELIZA might provide a generic response, for example, responding to "My head hurts" with "Why do you say your head hurts?".

During the 1970s, many programmers began to write "conceptual [[ontology (information science)|ontologies]]", which structured real-world information into computer-understandable data.  Examples are MARGIE (Schank, 1975), SAM (Cullingford, 1978), PAM (Wilensky, 1978), TaleSpin (Meehan, 1976), QUALM (Lehnert, 1977), Politics (Carbonell, 1979), and Plot Units (Lehnert 1981).  During this time, many [[chatterbots]] were written including [[PARRY]], [[Racter]], and [[Jabberwacky]].

Up to the 1980s, most natural language processing systems were based on complex sets of hand-written rules.  Starting in the late 1980s, however, there was a revolution in natural language processing with the introduction of [[machine learning]] algorithms for language processing.  This was due to both the steady increase in computational power (see [[Moore's law]]) and the gradual lessening of the dominance of [[Noam Chomsky|Chomskyan]] theories of linguistics (e.g. [[transformational grammar]]), whose theoretical underpinnings discouraged the sort of [[corpus linguistics]] that underlies the machine-learning approach to language processing.&lt;ref&gt;Chomskyan linguistics encourages the investigation of "[[corner case]]s" that stress the limits of its theoretical models (comparable to [[pathological (mathematics)|pathological]] phenomena in mathematics), typically created using [[thought experiment]]s, rather than the systematic investigation of typical phenomena that occur in real-world data, as is the case in [[corpus linguistics]].  The creation and use of such [[text corpus|corpora]] of real-world data is a fundamental part of machine-learning algorithms for natural language processing.  In addition, theoretical underpinnings of Chomskyan linguistics such as the so-called "[[poverty of the stimulus]]" argument entail that general learning algorithms, as are typically used in machine learning, cannot be successful in language processing.  As a result, the Chomskyan paradigm discouraged the application of such models to language processing.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the earliest-used machine learning algorithms, such as [[decision tree]]s, produced systems of hard if-then rules similar to existing hand-written rules.  However, [[Part of speech tagging|part-of-speech tagging]] introduced the use of [[hidden Markov models]] to natural language processing, and increasingly, research has focused on [[statistical models]], which make soft, [[probabilistic]] decisions based on attaching [[real-valued]] weights to the features making up the input data. The [[cache language model]]s upon which many [[speech recognition]] systems now rely are examples of such statistical models.  Such models are generally more robust when given unfamiliar input, especially input that contains errors (as is very common for real-world data), and produce more reliable results when integrated into a larger system comprising multiple subtasks.

Many of the notable early successes occurred in the field of [[machine translation]], due especially to work at IBM Research, where successively more complicated statistical models were developed.  These systems were able to take advantage of existing multilingual [[text corpus|textual corpora]] that had been produced by the [[Parliament of Canada]] and the [[European Union]] as a result of laws calling for the translation of all governmental proceedings into all official languages of the corresponding systems of government.  However, most other systems depended on corpora specifically developed for the tasks implemented by these systems, which was (and often continues to be) a major limitation in the success of these systems. As a result, a great deal of research has gone into methods of more effectively learning from limited amounts of data.

Recent research has increasingly focused on [[unsupervised learning|unsupervised]] and [[semi-supervised learning]] algorithms.  Such algorithms are able to learn from data that has not been hand-annotated with the desired answers, or using a combination of annotated and non-annotated data.  Generally, this task is much more difficult than [[supervised learning]], and typically produces less accurate results for a given amount of input data.  However, there is an enormous amount of non-annotated data available (including, among other things, the entire content of the [[World Wide Web]]), which can often make up for the inferior results if the algorithm used has a low enough [[time complexity]] to be practical.

In the 2010s, [[representation learning]] and [[deep learning|deep neural network]]-style machine learning methods became widespread in natural language processing, due in part to a flurry of results showing that such techniques&lt;ref name=goldberg:nnlp17&gt;Goldberg, Yoav (2016). [https://www.jair.org/media/4992/live-4992-9623-jair.pdf A Primer on Neural Network Models for Natural Language Processing].

MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; can achieve state-of-the-art results in many natural language tasks, for example in language modeling,&lt;ref name=jozefowicz:lm16&gt;Rafal Jozefowicz, Oriol Vinyals, Mike Schuster, Noam Shazeer, and Yonghui Wu (2016). https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02410 Exploring the Limits of Language Modeling&lt;/ref&gt;
parsing,&lt;ref name=choe:emnlp16&gt;Do Kook Choe and Eugene Charniak (EMNLP 2016). https://aclanthology.coli.uni-saarland.de/papers/D16-1257/d16-1257 Parsing as Language Modeling&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vinyals:nips15"&gt;Vinyals, Oriol, et al. (NIPS2015). https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5635-grammar-as-a-foreign-language.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and many others. Popular techniques include the use of [[word embedding]]s to capture semantic properties of words, and an increase in end-to-end learning of a higher-level task (e.g., question answering) instead of relying on a pipeline of separate intermediate tasks (e.g., part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing). In some areas, this shift has entailed substantial changes in how NLP systems are designed, such that deep neural network-based approaches may be viewed as a new paradigm distinct from statistical natural language processing. For instance, the term ''[[neural machine translation]]'' (NMT) emphasizes the fact that deep learning-based approaches to machine translation directly learn sequence-to-sequence transformations, obviating the need for intermediate steps such as word alignment and language modeling that were used in [[statistical machine translation]] (SMT).

==Rule-based vs. statistical NLP==
In the early days, many language-processing systems were designed by hand-coding a set of rules,&lt;ref name=winograd:shrdlu71&gt;Winograd, Terry (1971). Procedures as a Representation for Data in a Computer Program for Understanding Natural Language. http://hci.stanford.edu/winograd/shrdlu/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=schank77&gt;Roger C. Schank and Robert P. Abelson (1977). Scripts, plans, goals, and understanding: An inquiry into human knowledge structures&lt;/ref&gt;, e.g. by writing grammars or devising heuristic rules for [[stemming]].
However, this is rarely robust to natural language variation. 

Since the so-called "statistical revolution"&lt;ref name=johnson:eacl:ilcl09&gt;[http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W09-0103 Mark Johnson. How the statistical revolution changes (computational) linguistics.] Proceedings of the EACL 2009 Workshop on the Interaction between Linguistics and Computational Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=resnik:langlog11&gt;[http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2946 Philip Resnik. Four revolutions.] Language Log, February 5, 2011. &lt;/ref&gt;
in the late 1980s and mid 1990s, much natural language processing research has relied heavily on [[machine learning]].

The machine-learning paradigm calls instead for using [[statistical inference]] to automatically learn such rules through the analysis of large ''[[text corpus|corpora]]'' of typical real-world examples (a ''corpus'' (plural, "corpora") is a set of documents, possibly with human or computer annotations).

Many different classes of machine-learning algorithms have been applied to natural-language-processing tasks. These algorithms take as input a large set of "features" that are generated from the input data. Some of the earliest-used algorithms, such as [[decision tree]]s, produced systems of hard if-then rules similar to the systems of hand-written rules that were then common. Increasingly, however, research has focused on [[statistical models]], which make soft, [[probabilistic]] decisions based on attaching [[real-valued]] weights to each input feature. Such models have the advantage that they can express the relative certainty of many different possible answers rather than only one, producing more reliable results when such a model is included as a component of a larger system.

Systems based on machine-learning algorithms have many advantages over hand-produced rules:
*The learning procedures used during machine learning automatically focus on the most common cases, whereas when writing rules by hand it is often not at all obvious where the effort should be directed.
*Automatic learning procedures can make use of statistical-inference algorithms to produce models that are robust to unfamiliar input (e.g. containing words or structures that have not been seen before) and to erroneous input (e.g. with misspelled words or words accidentally omitted). Generally, handling such input gracefully with hand-written rules—or, more generally, creating systems of hand-written rules that make soft decisions—is extremely difficult, error-prone and time-consuming.
*Systems based on automatically learning the rules can be made more accurate simply by supplying more input data. However, systems based on hand-written rules can only be made more accurate by increasing the complexity of the rules, which is a much more difficult task.  In particular, there is a limit to the complexity of systems based on hand-crafted rules, beyond which the systems become more and more unmanageable.  However, creating more data to input to machine-learning systems simply requires a corresponding increase in the number of man-hours worked, generally without significant increases in the complexity of the annotation process.

==Major evaluations and tasks==
The following is a list of some of the most commonly researched tasks in natural language processing.  Note that some of these tasks have direct real-world applications, while others more commonly serve as subtasks that are used to aid in solving larger tasks.

Though natural language processing tasks are closely intertwined, they are frequently subdivided into categories for convenience. A coarse division is given below.

===Syntax===
; [[Grammar induction]]&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Dan, and Christopher D. Manning. "[http://papers.nips.cc/paper/1945-natural-language-grammar-induction-using-a-constituent-context-model.pdf Natural language grammar induction using a constituent-context model]." Advances in neural information processing systems. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;: Generate a [[formal grammar]] that describes a language's syntax.
; [[Lemmatisation|Lemmatization]]: The task of removing inflectional endings only and to return the base dictionary form of a word which is also known as a lemma.
; [[Morphology (linguistics)|Morphological segmentation]]: Separate words into individual [[morpheme]]s and identify the class of the morphemes.  The difficulty of this task depends greatly on the complexity of the [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (i.e. the structure of words) of the language being considered. [[English language|English]] has fairly simple morphology, especially [[inflectional morphology]], and thus it is often possible to ignore this task entirely and simply model all possible forms of a word (e.g. "open, opens, opened, opening") as separate words.  In languages such as [[Turkish language|Turkish]] or [[Meitei language|Meitei]],&lt;ref&gt;Kishorjit, N., Vidya Raj RK., Nirmal Y., and Sivaji B. (2012) "[http://aclweb.org/anthology//W/W12/W12-5008.pdf Manipuri Morpheme Identification]", Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on South and Southeast Asian Natural Language Processing (SANLP), pages 95–108, COLING 2012, Mumbai, December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; a highly [[Agglutination|agglutinated]] Indian language, however, such an approach is not possible, as each dictionary entry has thousands of possible word forms.
; [[Part-of-speech tagging]]: Given a sentence, determine the [[part of speech]] for each word.  Many words, especially common ones, can serve as multiple [[parts of speech]].  For example, "book" can be a [[noun]] ("the book on the table") or [[verb]] ("to book a flight"); "set" can be a [[noun]], [[verb]] or [[adjective]]; and "out" can be any of at least five different parts of speech.  Some languages have more such ambiguity than others.{{dubious|date=June 2018}}  Languages with little [[inflectional morphology]], such as [[English language|English]], are particularly prone to such ambiguity. [[Chinese language|Chinese]] is prone to such ambiguity because it is a [[tonal language]] during verbalization. Such inflection is not readily conveyed via the entities employed within the orthography to convey intended meaning.
; [[Parsing]]: (see also: [[Stochastic grammar]]) Determine the [[parse tree]] (grammatical analysis) of a given sentence.  The [[grammar]] for [[natural language]]s is [[ambiguous]] and typical sentences have multiple possible analyses.  In fact, perhaps surprisingly, for a typical sentence there may be thousands of potential parses (most of which will seem completely nonsensical to a human). There are two primary types of parsing, Dependency Parsing and Constituency Parsing. Dependency Parsing focuses on the relationships between words in a sentence (marking things like Primary Objects and predicates), whereas Constituency Parsing focuses on building out the Parse Tree using a [[Probabilistic_context-free_grammar|Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar]] (PCFG). 
; [[Sentence breaking]] (also known as [[sentence boundary disambiguation]]): Given a chunk of text, find the sentence boundaries.  Sentence boundaries are often marked by [[Full stop|period]]s or other [[punctuation mark]]s, but these same characters can serve other purposes (e.g. marking [[abbreviation]]s).
; [[Stemming]]
; [[Word segmentation]]:Separate a chunk of continuous text into separate words.  For a language like [[English language|English]], this is fairly trivial, since words are usually separated by spaces.  However, some written languages like [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Thai language|Thai]] do not mark word boundaries in such a fashion, and in those languages text segmentation is a significant task requiring knowledge of the [[vocabulary]] and [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] of words in the language. Sometimes this process is also used in cases like Bag of Words (BOW) creation in data mining.
; [[Terminology extraction]]: The goal of terminology extraction is to automatically extract relevant terms from a given corpus.

===Semantics===
; [[Lexical semantics]]: What is the computational meaning of individual words in context?
; [[Machine translation]]: Automatically translate text from one human language to another.  This is one of the most difficult problems, and is a member of a class of problems colloquially termed "[[AI-complete]]", i.e. requiring all of the different types of knowledge that humans possess (grammar, semantics, facts about the real world, etc.) in order to solve properly.
; [[Named entity recognition]] (NER): Given a stream of text, determine which items in the text map to proper names, such as people or places, and what the type of each such name is (e.g. person, location, organization).  Note that, although [[capitalization]] can aid in recognizing named entities in languages such as English, this information cannot aid in determining the type of named entity, and in any case is often inaccurate or insufficient.  For example, the first word of a sentence is also capitalized, and named entities often span several words, only some of which are capitalized.  Furthermore, many other languages in non-Western scripts (e.g. [[Chinese language|Chinese]] or [[Arabic language|Arabic]]) do not have any capitalization at all, and even languages with capitalization may not consistently use it to distinguish names. For example, [[German language|German]] capitalizes all [[noun]]s, regardless of whether they are names, and [[French language|French]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] do not capitalize names that serve as [[adjective]]s.
; [[Natural language generation]]: Convert information from computer databases or semantic intents into readable human language.
; [[Natural language understanding]]: Convert chunks of text into more formal representations such as [[first-order logic]] structures that are easier for [[computer]] programs to manipulate. Natural language understanding involves the identification of the intended semantic from the multiple possible semantics which can be derived from a natural language expression which usually takes the form of organized notations of natural language concepts. Introduction and creation of language metamodel and ontology are efficient however empirical solutions. An explicit formalization of natural language semantics without confusions with implicit assumptions such as [[closed-world assumption]] (CWA) vs. [[open-world assumption]], or subjective Yes/No vs. objective True/False is expected for the construction of a basis of semantics formalization.&lt;ref&gt;Yucong Duan, Christophe Cruz (2011), ''[http://www.ijimt.org/abstract/100-E00187.htm Formalizing Semantic of Natural Language through Conceptualization from Existence]''. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009135952/http://www.ijimt.org/abstract/100-E00187.htm |date=2011-10-09 }} International Journal of Innovation, Management and Technology(2011) 2 (1), pp. 37-42.&lt;/ref&gt;
; [[Optical character recognition]] (OCR): Given an image representing printed text, determine the corresponding text.
; [[Question answering]]: Given a human-language question, determine its answer.  Typical questions have a specific right answer (such as "What is the capital of Canada?"), but sometimes open-ended questions are also considered (such as "What is the meaning of life?"). Recent works have looked at even more complex questions.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.academia.edu/2475776/Versatile_question_answering_systems_seeing_in_synthesis Versatile question answering systems: seeing in synthesis]", Mittal et al., IJIIDS, 5(2), 119-142, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
; [[Textual entailment|Recognizing Textual entailment]]: Given two text fragments, determine if one being true entails the other, entails the other's negation, or allows the other to be either true or false.&lt;ref name=rte:11&gt; PASCAL Recognizing Textual Entailment Challenge (RTE-7) https://tac.nist.gov//2011/RTE/ &lt;/ref&gt;
; [[Relationship extraction]]: Given a chunk of text, identify the relationships among named entities (e.g. who is married to whom).
; [[Sentiment analysis]] (see also [[multimodal sentiment analysis]]): Extract subjective information usually from a set of documents, often using online reviews to determine "polarity" about specific objects. It is especially useful for identifying trends of public opinion in the social media, for the purpose of marketing.
; [[Topic segmentation]] and recognition: Given a chunk of text, separate it into segments each of which is devoted to a topic, and identify the topic of the segment.
; [[Word sense disambiguation]]: Many words have more than one [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]; we have to select the meaning which makes the most sense in context.  For this problem, we are typically given a list of words and associated word senses, e.g. from a dictionary or from an online resource such as [[WordNet]].

===Discourse===
; [[Automatic summarization]]: Produce a readable summary of a chunk of text.  Often used to provide summaries of text of a known type, such as articles in the financial section of a newspaper.
; [[Coreference|Coreference resolution]]: Given a sentence or larger chunk of text, determine which words ("mentions") refer to the same objects ("entities"). [[Anaphora resolution]] is a specific example of this task, and is specifically concerned with matching up [[pronoun]]s with the nouns or names to which they refer. The more general task of coreference resolution also includes identifying so-called "bridging relationships" involving [[referring expression]]s. For example, in a sentence such as "He entered John's house through the front door", "the front door" is a referring expression and the bridging relationship to be identified is the fact that the door being referred to is the front door of John's house (rather than of some other structure that might also be referred to).
; [[Discourse analysis]]: This rubric includes a number of related tasks.  One task is identifying the [[discourse]] structure of connected text, i.e. the nature of the discourse relationships between sentences (e.g. elaboration, explanation, contrast).  Another possible task is recognizing and classifying the [[speech act]]s in a chunk of text (e.g. yes-no question, content question, statement, assertion, etc.).

===Speech===
; [[Speech recognition]]: Given a sound clip of a person or people speaking, determine the textual representation of the speech.  This is the opposite of [[text to speech]] and is one of the extremely difficult problems colloquially termed "[[AI-complete]]" (see above).  In [[natural speech]] there are hardly any pauses between successive words, and thus [[speech segmentation]] is a necessary subtask of speech recognition (see below).  Note also that in most spoken languages, the sounds representing successive letters blend into each other in a process termed [[coarticulation]], so the conversion of the [[analog signal]] to discrete characters can be a very difficult process.
; [[Speech segmentation]]: Given a sound clip of a person or people speaking, separate it into words.  A subtask of [[speech recognition]] and typically grouped with it.
; [[Text-to-speech]]:Given a text, transform those units and produce a spoken representation. Text-to-speech can be used to aid the visually impaired.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Yi|first=Chucai|title=Assistive Text Reading from Complex Background for Blind Persons|date=2012|work=Camera-Based Document Analysis and Recognition|pages=15–28|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-29364-1_2|isbn=9783642293634|last2=Tian|first2=Yingli|citeseerx=10.1.1.668.869}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nemo A534''' was a [[German Shepherd]] dog who served in the [[United States Air Force]] during the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oneijak.com/NEMOA534.html|title=United States Air Force Sentry Dog - Nemo A534 Honored at Lackland AFB, Texas|publisher=Oneijak.com|accessdate=2011-01-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20080510153433/http://www.oneijak.com/NEMOA534.html|archivedate=2008-05-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==December 4, 1966==
[[Tan Son Nhut Air Base]], where Nemo was stationed, fell under attack by the [[Viet Cong]] in the early hours of December 4, 1966. Nemo would be released to attack Viet Cong later in the night, in the process losing one eye and suffering a gunshot wound to the nose. A bullet would enter under his right eye and exit through his mouth. Despite his severe injuries, Nemo would save the life of his handler, Airman Robert A. Throneburg, who had also been wounded. Crawling across Throneburg's body, Nemo guarded his handler against any who dared to come near until medical help could arrive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.tsna.org/7thafnews/aug091967.html | title=AF Sentry Dog To Become Symbol Of Professionalism | journal=HQ. Seventh Air Force News| date=August 9, 1967 | volume= 3 | issue= 31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the silence of darkness, the Airman Robert Throneburg and Sentry Dog Nemo patrolled near a graveyard on Tan Son Nhut Airbase on the night of December 4, 1966. On security patrol, Nemo alerted Throneburg to a group of hidden VC."Watch him," said Airman Throneburg. The dog's muscles tensed for action."Get him!" -- was the next command and Nemo lunged savagely forward, into the enemy's nest. Airman Throneburg followed close behind.

In the first moments of encounter, Airman Throneburg and Nemo killed two of the VC. But, before additional security police could reach them, Airman Throneburg was wounded in the left side shoulder and then spun by the first bullet wound and was wounded again in the back left shoulder. After being of Airman Throneburg, but indirectly prevented further destruction of life and property at Tan Son Nhut.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Airman Robert Throneburg received two [[Purple Heart]]s and the [[Bronze Star Medal]] with the V for valour (BSV). Nemo was one of the first [[War dogs|K-9 units]] retired and returned to the US.

==Later life==
Due to his heroic actions, after receiving his injuries Nemo was returned to [[Lackland Air Force Base]]  in the [[United States]] where he was given a permanent retirement kennel. He continued working as a recruiting dog and died in December 1972 at Lackland  where his memorial kennels and stone stand today in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olive-drab.com/od_wardogs_famous.php|title=Famous War Dogs|publisher=Olive-Drab.com|accessdate=2011-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31868">An '''orphan drug''' is a [[medication|pharmaceutical agent]] that has been developed specifically to treat a rare medical condition, the condition itself being referred to as an [[orphan disease]].

The assignment of '''orphan status''' to a disease and to any drugs developed to treat it is a matter of [[public policy (law)|public policy]] in many countries and has resulted in medical breakthroughs that may not have otherwise been achieved due to the economics of drug [[medical research|research and development]].&lt;ref name="Executive"/&gt;

In the US and the EU, it is easier to gain marketing approval for an orphan drug, and there may be other financial incentives, such as an extended period of exclusivity, a time during which that company is the only one allowed to market the orphan drug—all intended to encourage the development of those drugs which might otherwise lack a sufficient [[profit motive]] and market to attract companies' research budgets and personnel.&lt;ref name="EvaluatePharma_2014"&gt;{{citation |url=http://info.evaluategroup.com/rs/evaluatepharmaltd/images/2014OD.pdf |format=PDF |first=Andreas |last=Hadjivasiliou|title=Orphan Drug Report 2014 |date=October 2014 |work=EvaluatePharma |accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Daly_2002" /&gt;

==Definition==
An orphan drug is a [[medication|pharmaceutical agent]] which has been developed to treat a rare medical condition, the condition itself being referred to as a [[rare disease]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} A rare disease, also referred to as an "orphan disease", is any disease which affects a small percentage of the population. Most rare diseases are genetic, and thus are present throughout the person's entire life, even if symptoms do not immediately appear. Many rare diseases appear early in life, and about 30 percent of children with rare diseases will die before reaching their fifth birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siope.eu/SIOPE-EU/English/SIOPE-EU/Advocacy-Activities/Rare-Diseases/page.aspx/148 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-24 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121203212325/http://www.siope.eu/SIOPE-EU/English/SIOPE-EU/Advocacy-Activities/Rare-Diseases/page.aspx/148 |archivedate=December 3, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; No single cutoff number has been agreed upon for which a disease is considered rare.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} A disease may be considered rare in one part of the world, or in a particular group of people, but still be common in another.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} As many as one-in-ten Americans suffers from rare disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rare diseases' troubling questions |author=Andrew Duffy|newspaper=Cobourg Daily Star (Ontario) |date=25 January 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global statistics==
{{as of|2014}}, there were 281 marketed orphan drugs and more than 400 orphan designated drugs in clinical trials. More than 60% of orphan drugs were biologics. The US dominated the development of orphan drugs with more than 300 orphan drugs in clinical trial process, followed by Europe. [[Cancer treatment]] was the indication in more than 30% for orphan drug clinical trials.&lt;ref name="Kuick_2014"&gt;{{citation| title=Global orphan drug market to reach US$ 120 billion by 2018|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-orphan-drug-market-to-reach-us-120-billion-by-2018-244195511.html|accessdate=20 March 2014|publisher=Kuick Research|date=7 Feb 2014 |location=New Delhi|format=press release}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect on investment, sales and profit==
According to [[Thomson Reuters]] in their 2012 publication "The Economic Power of Orphan Drugs," there has been increased investing in orphan drug research and development partly due to the U. S. [[Orphan Drug Act of 1983]] (ODA) and similar acts in other regions of the world and also driven by "high-profile philanthropic funding."&lt;ref name="ThomsonReuters_2012"&gt;{{citation |url=http://thomsonreuters.com/content/dam/openweb/documents/pdf/pharma-life-sciences/white-paper/1001450.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Economic Power of Orphan Drugs |work=Thomson Reuters |year=2012 |accessdate=29 June 2015 |authors=Laura Gaze, Jennifer Breen |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150513083426/http://thomsonreuters.com/content/dam/openweb/documents/pdf/pharma-life-sciences/white-paper/1001450.pdf |archivedate=13 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Economically_viable_2012"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.drugdiscoverytoday.com/download/900 |title=Orphan drug development: an economically viable strategy for biopharma R&amp;D |date=15 August 2012 |accessdate=29 June 2015 |authors=Kiran N. Meeking, Cory S.M. Williams, John E. Arrowsmith |doi=10.1016/j.drudis.2012.02.005 |volume=17 |journal=Drug Discovery Today |pages=660–664 |pmid=22366309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Per the trade journal [[Drug Discovery Today]] between 2001 and 2011 was the "most productive period in the history of orphan drug development, in terms of average annual orphan drug designations and orphan drug approvals."&lt;ref name="Economically_viable_2012" /&gt;{{rp|660}} For the same decade the [[compound annual growth rate]] (CAGR) of the orphan drugs was an "impressive 25.8 percent, compared to only 20.1 percent for a matched control group of non-orphan drugs."&lt;ref name="ThomsonReuters_2012" /&gt;{{rp|6}} 
By 2012, the market for orphan drugs was worth USD$637 million compared to the USD$638 million matched control group of non-orphan drugs.&lt;ref name="ThomsonReuters_2012" /&gt;

By 2012,

{{quote|"the revenue-generating potential of orphan drugs [was] as great as for non-orphan drugs, even though patient populations for rare diseases are significantly smaller. Moreover, we suggest that orphan drugs have greater profitability when considered in the full context of developmental drivers including government financial incentives, smaller clinical trial sizes, shorter clinical trial times and higher rates of regulatory success."|Gaze and Breen 2012}}

According to a 2014 report, the orphan drug market has become increasingly lucrative for a number of reasons: The cost of clinical trials for orphan drugs is substantially lower than for other diseases —trial sizes are naturally much smaller than for more common diseases with larger numbers of patients. Small clinical trials and little competition place orphan agents at an advantage in regulatory review.&lt;ref name="EvaluatePharma_2014"/&gt;

Tax incentives reduce the cost of development. On average the cost per patient for orphan drugs is "six times that of non-orphan drugs, a clear indication of their pricing power". The cost of per-person outlays are huge and are expected to increase with wider use of public subsidies.&lt;ref name="EvaluatePharma_2014" /&gt;

The 2014 Orphan Drug report stated that the percentage of orphan drug sales as part of all prescription drug sales had been increasing at rapid rate. By 2020 the total was predicted to be $176 billion.&lt;ref name="EvaluatePharma_2014" /&gt; Although orphan disease populations are the smallest, the cost of per-patient outlays have been the largest. There pressure on pharmaceuticals which "represent the biggest budgetary drain" has been predicted to increase particularly as more people with rare diseases will be eligible for subsidies —in the United States for example through the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Affordable Care Act]].&lt;ref name="EvaluatePharma_2014" /&gt;

==Legislation==
Orphan drugs generally follow the same regulatory development path as any other pharmaceutical product, in which testing focuses on [[pharmacokinetics]] and [[pharmacodynamics]], [[dosing]], stability, safety and efficacy. However, some statistical burdens are lessened to maintain development momentum. For example, orphan drug regulations generally acknowledge the fact that it may not be possible to test 1,000 patients in a [[clinical trial|phase III clinical trial]], as fewer than that number may be afflicted with the disease in question.

Since the market for any drug with such a limited application scope would, by definition, be small and thus largely unprofitable for pharmaceutical companies, some governments have chosen to intervene to motivate a manufacturer to develop an orphan drug.&lt;ref name="EvaluatePharma_2014" /&gt;

The intervention by government on behalf of orphan drug development can take a variety of forms:
* [[Tax incentive]]s
* Exclusivity (enhanced patent protection and marketing rights)
* Financial research subsidies
* Creating a government-run enterprise to engage in research and development as in a [[Crown corporation]]

A 2015 study of "34 key Canadian stakeholders including drug regulators, funders, scientists, policy experts, pharmaceutical industry representatives, and patient advocates"  investigated contributing factors to the growing interest of the pharmaceutical industry in "niche markets" such as orphan drugs.&lt;ref name="World_Medicine_2015"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=World Medicine Health Policy |date= 19 March 2015 |volume=7 |number=1 |pages= 3–27 |doi=10.1002/wmh3.131 |title=Why the Shift?

===United States===

The [[Orphan Drug Act]] (ODA) of January 1983, passed in the [[United States]], with lobbying from the [[National Organization for Rare Disorders]] and many other organizations,&lt;ref name=henkel&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fda.gov/Fdac/features/1999/399_orph.html | last=Henkel | first=John | title=Orphan Drug Law Matures into Medical Mainstay | year=1999 | work=[[FDA Consumer]] | publisher=[[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] | accessdate=14 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; is meant to encourage [[pharmaceutical company|pharmaceutical companies]] to develop drugs for diseases that have a small market.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite web | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9C0CE4DF1F3EF933A05757C0A966958260 | title=Orphan Drug Law Spurs Debate | work=[[The New York Times]] | accessdate=15 February 2009 | last=Pollack | first=Andrew | date=30 April 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the ODA drugs, vaccines, and diagnostic agents would qualify for orphan status if they were intended to treat a disease affecting less than 200,000 American citizens. Under the ODA orphan drug sponsors qualify for seven-year FDA-administered market Orphan Drug Exclusivity (ODE), "tax credits of up to 50% of R&amp;D costs, R&amp;D grants, waived FDA fees, protocol assistance&lt;ref name="Economically_viable_2012"/&gt;{{rp|660}} and may get clinical trial [[tax incentive]]s.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

Orphan drug designation means that the sponsor qualifies for certain benefits but it does not mean the drug is safe and effective and legal to manufacture and market in the United States.

In 2002, the [[Rare Diseases Act of 2002|Rare Diseases Act]] was signed into law. It amended the [[Public Health Service Act]] to establish the [[Office of Rare Diseases]]. It also increased funding for the development of treatments for people with [[rare diseases]].&lt;ref name="Law"/&gt;

===European Union===
In 2000, the [[European Union]] (EU) has enacted similar legislation, Regulation(EC) No 141/2000, which refers to drugs developed to treat rare diseases to as "orphan medicinal products". The EU's definition of an orphan condition is broader than that of the USA, in that it also covers some tropical diseases that are primarily found in developing nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11418 |title=Orphan disease definition - Medical Dictionary definitions of popular medical terms easily defined on MedTerms |publisher=Medterms.com |date=2002-08-25 |accessdate=2010-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orphan drug status granted by the European Commission gives marketing exclusivity in the EU for 10 years after approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gerke|first=Sara|last2=Pattinson|first2=Shaun D.|date=2017-02-09|title=EU Marketing Authorisation of Orphan Medicinal Products and Its Impact on Related Research|url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/15718093-12341439|journal=Brill|doi=10.1163/15718093-12341439|volume=24|pages=541–564}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EU's legislation is administered by the [[Committee on Orphan Medicinal Products]] of the [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA).

In late 2007 the FDA and EMA agreed to use a common application process for both agencies to make it easier for manufacturers to apply for orphan drug status but, while continuing two separate approval processes.&lt;ref name="BWN112007"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other countries===
Legislation has been implemented by Japan, Singapore, and Australia that offers subsidies and other incentives to encourage the development of drugs that treat orphan diseases.&lt;ref name="Windsor"&gt;{{cite news |title=ORPHAN DISEASES A RARE OCCURRENCE: A desperate search for help; County family joins long list with rare diseases in seeking a miracle |author=Andrew Duffy |newspaper=Windsor Star (Ontario) |date=23 February 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Numbers of new drugs===
Under the ODA and EU legislation, many orphan drugs have been developed, including drugs to treat [[glioma]], [[multiple myeloma]], [[cystic fibrosis]], [[phenylketonuria]], [[snake venom]] poisoning, and [[idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The Pharmaceitical Executive opines, that the "ODA is nearly universally acknowledged to be a success".&lt;ref name="Executive"&gt;{{cite news |title=Pharma's Orphans |author=Armstrong, Walter |newspaper=Pharmaceutical Executive |date=May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Before the [[United States Congress]] enacted the ODA in 1983, only 38 drugs were approved in the USA specifically to treat orphan diseases.&lt;ref name="Daly_2002"&gt;{{cite news |title=House Offers Incentives For Development of 'Orphan' Drugs |author=Rich Daly |newspaper=Congressional Quarterly Daily Monitor |date=5 September 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the USA, from January 1983 to June 2004, the Office of Orphan Products Development 249 orphan drugs received marketing authorization and granted 1,129 different orphan drug designations, compared to fewer than ten such products in the decade prior to 1983. 
From 1983 until May 2010, the FDA approved 353 orphan drugs and granted orphan designations to 2,116 compounds. 
As of 2010, 200 of the roughly 7,000 officially designated orphan diseases have become treatable.&lt;ref name="Executive"/&gt;

Critics have questioned whether orphan drug legislation was the real cause of this increase, claiming that many of the new drugs were for disorders which were already being researched anyway, and would have had drugs developed regardless of the legislation, and whether the ODA has truly  stimulated the production of non-profitable drugs; the act also has been criticised for allowing some pharmaceutical companies to make a large profit of drugs which have a small market but sell for a high price.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

While the European Medicines Agency grants orphan drugs market access to all member states, in practice, they only reach the market when a member state decides that its national health system will reimburse for the drug. For example, in 2008, 44 orphan drugs reached the market in the Netherlands, 35 in Belgium, and 28 in Sweden, while in 2007, 35 such drugs reached the market in France and 23 in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Denis |first1=Alain |last2=Mergaert |first2=Lut |last3=Fostier |first3=Christel |last4=et al|title=Issues Surrounding Orphan Disease and Orphan Drug Policies in Europe |journal=Applied Health Economics and Health Policy |volume= 8 |issue=5 |pages=341 |doi=10.2165/11536990-000000000-00000|year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though not technically an orphan disease, the research and development into the treatment for [[AIDS]] has been heavily linked to the [[Orphan Drug Act]]. In the beginning of the AIDS epidemic the lack of treatment for the disease was often accredited to a believed lack of commercial base for a medication linked to [[HIV]] infection. This encouraged the FDA to use the Orphan Drug Act to help bolster research in this field, and by 1995 13 of the 19 drugs approved by the FDA to treat AIDS had received orphan drug designation, with 10 receiving marketing rights. These are in addition to the 70 designated orphan drugs designed to treat other HIV related illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arno|first=Peter S.|last2=Bonuck|first2=Karen|last3=Davis|first3=Michael|date=1995-01-01|title=Rare Diseases, Drug Development, and AIDS: The Impact of the Orphan Drug Act|jstor=3350258|journal=The Milbank Quarterly|volume=73|issue=2|pages=231–252|doi=10.2307/3350258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples for selected diseases==

In the 1980s, people with [[cystic fibrosis]] rarely lived beyond their early teens. Drugs like [[Pulmozyme]] and [[tobramycin]], both developed with aid from the ODA, revolutionized treatment for cystic fibrosis patients by significantly improving their quality of life and extending their life expectancies. Now, cystic fibrosis patients often survive into their thirties and some into their fifties.&lt;ref name="Law"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Illingworth |first1=Patricia |last2=Cohen |first2=Jillian |last3=Illingworth |first3=P |year=2004 |title=Orphan Drug Policies: Implications for the United States, Canada, and Developing Countries |journal=Health Law Journal |volume=12 |pages=183–200|pmid=16539081 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1985 Nobel Prize for medicine went to two researchers for their work related to  [[familial hypercholesterolemia]], which causes large and rapid increases in cholesterol levels. Their research led to the development of [[Statins|statin drugs]] which are now commonly used to treat high cholesterol.&lt;ref name="Windsor"/&gt;

[[Penicillamine]] was developed to treat [[Wilson's disease]], a rare hereditary disease that can lead to a fatal accumulation of copper in the body. This drug was later found to be effective in treating [[arthritis]].&lt;ref name="Windsor"/&gt; [[Bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate]] is currently under investigation as a therapy against Wilson's disease.

==Activism, research centers==
The [[Center for Orphan Drug Research]] at the [[University of Minnesota]] College of Pharmacy helps small companies with insufficient in-house expertise and resources in drug synthesis, formulation, pharmacometrics, and bio-analysis.&lt;ref name="Technology"&gt;{{cite news |title=Celebrating 25 Years of Orphan Drugs|author=Wechsler, Jill |newspaper=Pharmaceutical Technology |date=July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Keck Graduate Institute]] Center for Rare Disease Therapies (CRDT) in Claremont, California, supports projects to revive potential orphan drugs whose development has stalled by identifying barriers to commercialization, such as problems with formulation and bio-processing.&lt;ref name="Technology"/&gt;

Numerous advocacy groups such as the [[National Organization for Rare Disorders]], [[Global Genes Project]], Children's Rare Disease Network, Abetalipoproteinemia Collaboration Foundation, Zellweger Baby Support Network, and the Friedreich's Ataxia Research Alliance have been founded in order to advocate on behalf of  patients suffering from rare diseases with a particular emphasis on diseases that afflict children.&lt;ref name="Executive"/&gt;

==Cost==
According to a 2015 report published by EvaluatePharma, the economics of orphan drugs mirrors the economics of the pharmaceutical market as a whole but has a few very large differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=EvaluatePharma Orphan Drug Report 2015| last=Hadjivasiliou| first=Andreas| publisher=EvaulatePharma| year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The market for orphan drugs is by definition very small, but while the customer base is drastically smaller the cost of research and development is very much the same as for non orphan drugs. This, the producers have claimed, causes them to charge extremely high amounts for treatment sometimes as high as $700,000 a year, as in the case of [[Spinraza]] (Biogen), FDA approved in December 2016 for spinal muscular atrophy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thomas|first1=Katie|title=Costly Drug for Fatal Muscular Disease Wins F.D.A. Approval|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/30/business/spinraza-price.html|accessdate=12 April 2017|agency=New York Times|date=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; placing a large amount of stress on insurance companies and patients. An analysis of 12 orphan drugs that were approved in the US between 1990 and 2000 estimated a price reduction of on average 50% upon loss of marketing exclusivity, with a range of price reductions from 14% to 95%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://ojrd.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/1750-1172-6-62?site=ojrd.biomedcentral.com|title=Estimating the budget impact of orphan medicines in Europe: 2010 - 2020|author=Carina Schey , Tsveta Milanova and Adam Hutchings|journal=Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases|year=2011|volume=6|issue=62|doi=10.1186/1750-1172-6-62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Governments have implemented steps to reduce high research and development cost with subsidies and other forms of financial assistance. The largest assistance are tax breaks which can be as high as 50% of research and development costs.&lt;ref name=meek&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Meekings| first=Kiran N.|last2=Williams |first2=Cory S. M. |last3=Arrowsmith |first3=John E.| date=2012-07-01|title=Orphan drug development: an economically viable strategy for biopharma R&amp;D| url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359644612000529|journal=Drug Discovery Today| volume=17| issue=13–14| pages=660–664|doi=10.1016/j.drudis.2012.02.005|pmid=22366309}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orphan drug manufacturers are also able to take advantage of the small customer base to cut cost on clinical trials due to the small number of cases to have smaller trials which reduces cost. These smaller clinical trials also allow orphan drugs to move to market faster as the average time to receive FDA approval for an orphan drug is 10 months compared to 13 months for non-orphan drugs. This is especially true in the market for cancer drugs, as a 2011 study found that between 2004 and 2010 orphan drug trials were more likely to be smaller and less randomized than their non-orphan counterparts, but still had a higher FDA approval rate, with 15 orphan cancer drugs being approved, while only 12 non-orphan drugs were approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kesselheim AS|last2=Myers JA|last3=Avorn J|date=2011-06-08|title=CHaracteristics of clinical trials to support approval of orphan vs nonorphan drugs for cancer|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jama.2011.769|journal=JAMA|volume=305|issue=22|pages=2320–2326|doi=10.1001/jama.2011.769|issn=0098-7484|pmid=21642684}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows manufactures to get cost to the point that it is economically feasible to produce these treatments.&lt;ref name=meek/&gt; The subsidies can total up to 30 million dollars per fiscal year in the United States alone {{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=April 2017}}.

By 2015, industry analysts and academic researchers agreed, that the sky-high price of orphan drugs, such as [[eculizumab]], was not related to research, development and manufacturing costs. Their price is arbitrary and they have become more profitable than traditional medicines.&lt;ref name="CBC_Crowe_2015"&gt;{{citation |title=How pharmaceutical company Alexion set the price of the world's most expensive drug: Cost of one of world's most expensive drugs shrouded in corporate secrecy |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/how-pharmaceutical-company-alexion-set-the-price-of-the-world-s-most-expensive-drug-1.3125251 |first=Kelly |last=Crowe |work=CBC News |date=25 June 2015 |accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|"Public resources went into understanding the molecular basis of the disease, public resources went into the technology to make antibodies and finally, Alexion, to their credit, kind of picked up the pieces."|Sachdev Sidhu 2015}}

By 2007 the use of economic evaluation methods regarding public-funding of orphan drugs, using estimates of the incremental cost-effectiveness, for example, became more established internationally.&lt;ref name="Drummond_2007"&gt;{{citation |authors=Drummond MF, Grubert N. |title=International Trends in the Use of Health Economic Data |location=Waltham MA |series=Spectrum Report, Decision Resources |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The QALY has often been used in [[cost-utility analysis]] to calculate the ratio of cost to QALYs saved for a particular health care intervention.&lt;ref name="NICE_2010"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nice.org.uk/newsroom/features/measuringeffectivenessandcosteffectivenesstheqaly.jsp | title=Measuring effectiveness and cost effectiveness: the QALY | publisher=NICE | date=20 April 2010 | accessdate=15 Jun 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nice.org.uk/article/pmg9/chapter/6-the-appraisal-of-the-evidence-and-structured-decision-making | title=Guide to the methods of technology appraisal 2013 | publisher=NICE | date=2013 | accessdate=15 Jun 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2008 the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in England and Wales, for example, operated with a threshold range of £20,000–£30,000 per [[Quality-adjusted life year]] (QALY).&lt;ref name="Eurohealth_2008"&gt;{{citation |title=Challenges in the economic evaluation of orphan drugs |first=Michael F |last=Drummond |publisher=World Health Organization |journal=Eurohealth |volume=14 |number= 2 |pages= 16–257 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2005 doubts were raised about the use of economic evaluations in orphan drugs.&lt;ref name="Drummond_2007" /&gt; By 2008 most of the orphan drugs appraised had cost-effectiveness thresholds "well in excess of the ‘accepted’ level and would not be reimbursed according to conventional criteria."&lt;ref name="Eurohealth_2008" /&gt; As early as 2005 McCabe et al argued&lt;ref name="McCabe_2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McCabe_2007" /&gt; that rarity should not have a premium and orphan drugs should be treated like other pharmaceuticals in general.&lt;ref name="McCabe_2005"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=McCabe C, Claxton K, Tsuchiya A. |title=Orphan drugs and the NHS |journal=British Medical Journal |year=2005 |volume=331 |pages=1016–19 |number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McCabe_2007"&gt;{{cite journal  |authors=McCabe C, Tsuchiya A, Claxton K, Raftery J.|title= Assessing the economic challenges posed by orphan drugs: a comment on Drummond et al. |journal=International Journal of Technology Assessment in Health Care |year=2007 |volume=23 |number=3 |pages=397–404 |doi=10.1017/s0266462307071012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drummond et al&lt;ref name="McCabe_2007" /&gt; argued that the social value of health technologies should also be included in the assessment along than the estimation of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.

===Abuse potential===
[[File:Rosuvastatin-Formulae V 1.png|thumb|Rosuvastatin (brand name Crestor) is an example of a drug that received Orphan Drug funding but was later marketed to a large consumer base.]]
The very large incentives given to pharmaceutical companies to produce orphan drugs have led to the impression that the financial support afforded to make these drugs possible is akin to abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simoens|first=Steven|date=2011-06-17|title=Pricing and reimbursement of orphan drugs: the need for more transparency|url=http://ojrd.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1750-1172-6-42|journal= Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases|language=En|volume=6|issue=1|doi=10.1186/1750-1172-6-42|pmc=3132155|pmid=21682893|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because drugs can be used to treat multiple conditions, companies can take drugs that were filed with their government agency as orphan drugs to receive financial assistance, and then market it to a wide population to increase their [[profit margin]]. For example [[AstraZeneca]]'s cholesterol drug [[Rosuvastatin|Crestor]] was filed as a treatment for the rare disease pediatric [[familial hypercholesterolemia]]. After the drug was approved for orphan drug designation, and AstraZeneca had received tax breaks and other advantages, AstraZeneca later applied and received FDA approval for the drug to be used to treat cholesterol in all diabetics.&lt;ref name="Windsor"/&gt;

===NICE===

By 2008 if an orphan drug cost more than £30,000{{clarify|reason=30k per patient? For total cost of treatment? Per some time period?|date=July 2015}} the [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence|NICE]] required other arguments for funding.&lt;ref name="Eurohealth_2008" /&gt;

In 2015, NICE held consultations with "patient groups, the Department of Health, companies, learned societies, charities and researchers" regarding the appraisal of medicines and other technologies. There was a call for more research into new processes including the &lt;ref name="NICE_2014"&gt;{{citation |title=NICE calls for a new approach to managing the entry of drugs into the NHS |url= http://www.nice.org.uk/news/press-and-media/nice-calls-for-a-new-approach-to-managing-the-entry-of-drugs-into-the-nhs |date= 18 September 2014 |accessdate= 29 June 2015 |work=NICE }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pet Rock''' is a [[Collectable|collectible]] conceived in 1975 by [[advertising]] executive [[Gary Dahl (entrepreneur)|Gary Dahl]]. Pet Rocks are smooth stones from Mexico's [[Rosarito Beach]].&lt;ref name="LATobit"/&gt;  They were marketed like live [[pet]]s, in custom cardboard boxes,&lt;ref name="LATobit"/&gt; complete with straw and breathing holes.&lt;ref name="bathroom" /&gt; The fad lasted about six months, ending after a short increase in sales during the Christmas season of December 1975. Although by February 1976 they were discounted due to lower sales, Dahl sold 1.5 million&lt;!-- LATimes obit said more than 1 million --&gt; Pet Rocks for $4 each,&lt;ref name="LATobit"/&gt; and became a millionaire.&lt;ref name=ap19770207&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VhBXAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=V0MNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4238%2C2999792 | title=Pet rock millionaire offers a new method to getting stoned | work=The Miami News | date=1977-02-07 | agency=Associated Press | accessdate=December 18, 2011 | pages=2A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mj19881115"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TG8aAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=1SoEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4700%2C7130376 | title=Between Pet Rock and a hard place | work=The Milwaukee Journal | date=1988-11-15 | accessdate=December 18, 2011 | pages=2A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HD70"&gt;{{cite book|last=Olson|first=James Stuart|title=Historical Dictionary of the 1970s|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=1999|page=284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With his money, Dahl opened a bar named "Carry Nations" in downtown [[Los Gatos, California]], a reference to [[Carrie Nation]].{{r|ap19770207}} Dahl continued to work in advertising; however, he avoided interviews for years, because "a bunch of wackos" harassed him with lawsuits and threats. Dahl said in 1988: "Sometimes I look back and wonder if my life wouldn't have been simpler if I hadn't done it."{{r|mj19881115}}

==Development==
In April 1975, in a bar in [[Bonny Doon, California|Bonny Doon]], [[Gary Dahl (entrepreneur)|Gary Dahl]] listened to his friends complain about their [[pet]]s; this gave him the idea for the perfect "pet": a [[Rock (geology)|rock]].&lt;ref name="bathroom"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A rock would not need to be fed, walked, bathed, or groomed, and it would not die, become sick, or be disobedient. Dahl said that they were to be the perfect pets and joked about it with his friends.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
He took his idea seriously, however, and drafted an "instruction manual" for a pet rock. The manual was full of [[pun]]s and gags that referred to the rock as an actual pet.

Dahl's biggest expense was the die-cutting and manufacture of the boxes. The rocks only cost a penny each, and the straw was nearly free. For the initial run of booklets, Dahl had a printing job for a client, and "tacked" the pet rock booklet onto the main job.  This resulted in a batch requiring only a cut and trim, at almost no cost except for some labor.

==Marketing==
[[File:Pet rock.jpg|thumb|right|220px]]
A 32-page official training manual titled ''The Care and Training of Your Pet Rock'' was included, with instructions on how to properly raise and care for one's new Pet Rock (notably lacking instructions for feeding, bathing, and so on).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/252772385/The-Care-and-Training-of-Your-Pet-Rock-Manual-by-Gary-Dahl|title=The Care and Training of Your Pet Rock Manual by Gary Dahl|work=Scribd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The instruction manual was the real product, full of gags, puns and jokes, and contained several commands that could be taught to the new pet. While "sit" and "stay" were effortless to accomplish, "roll over" usually required a little extra help from the trainer. "Come," "stand" and "shake hands" were found to be near-impossible to teach; however, "attack" was fairly simple (also with some additional help from the owner's force).

==Availability==
The Pet Rock became available again on September 3, 2012. Rosebud Entertainment currently holds the United States trademark rights to the Pet Rock.&lt;ref name="USPTO1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=76656255&amp;caseType=SERIAL_NO&amp;searchType=statusSearch|title=Trademark Status &amp; Document Retrieval|work=uspto.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9548">[[File:Sangiovese grapevine.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A Sangiovese grapevine in a vineyard with a cane extended. Prior to this cane developing grape clusters it could have been planted in the ground to propagate by layering.]]
The '''propagation of grapevines''' is an important consideration in commercial [[viticulture]] and [[winemaking]]. Grapevines, most of which belong to the ''[[Vitis vinifera]]'' family, produce one crop of fruit each [[growing season (vine)|growing season]] with a limited life span for individual vines. While some centenarian [[old vine]] examples of [[grape varieties]] exist, most grapevines are between the ages of 10 and 30 years. As vineyard owners seek to replant their vines, a number of techniques are available which may include planting a new [[cutting (plant)|cutting]] that has been selected by either [[clonal (plant)|clonal]] or mass (massal) selection. Vines can also be propagated by [[grafting]] a new plant vine upon existing [[rootstock]] or by [[layering]] one of the [[canes (vine)|canes]] of an existing vine into the ground next to the vine and severing the connection when the new vine develops its own root system.&lt;ref name="WSET"&gt;Wine &amp; Spirits Education Trust ''"Wine and Spirits: Understanding Wine Quality"'' pgs 2-5, Second Revised Edition (2012), London, {{ISBN|9781905819157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In commercial viticulture, grapevines are rarely propagated from [[seedling]]s as each seed contains unique genetic information from its two parent varieties (the flowering parent and the parent that provided the pollen that fertilized the flower) and would, theoretically, be a different variety than either parent. This would be true even if two [[hermaphroditic]] vine varieties, such as [[Chardonnay]], cross pollinated each other. While the grape clusters that would arise from the pollination would be considered Chardonnay any vines that sprang from one of the seeds of the grape berries would be considered a distinct variety other than Chardonnay. It is for this reason that grapevines are usually propagated from cuttings while [[grape breeders]] will utilize seedlings to come up with new grape varieties including [[crossings (plant)|crossings]] that include parents of two varieties within the same species (such as [[Cabernet Sauvignon]] which is a crossing of the ''Vitis vinifera'' varieties [[Cabernet Franc]] and [[Sauvignon blanc]]) or [[hybrid grape]] varieties which include parents from two different ''[[Vitis]]'' species such as the [[Armagnac (brandy)|Armagnac]] grape [[Baco blanc]], which was propagated from the ''vinifera'' grape [[Folle blanche]] and the ''[[Vitis labrusca]]'' variety [[Noah (grape)|Noah]].&lt;ref name="WSET"/&gt;

==Terminology==
[[File:Pinot noir, Pinot gris and Pinot blanc.png|right|260px|thumb|Pinot gris ''(center)'' and Pinot blanc ''(right)'' are color mutations of Pinot noir ''(left)''.]]
In viticulture, a '''clone''' is single vine that has been selected from a "mother vine" to which it is identically similar. This clone may have been selected deliberately from a grapevine that has demonstrated desirable traits (good [[yields (wine)|yields]], [[grape disease]] resistance, small berry size, etc.) and propagated as cuttings from that mother vine. Varieties such as [[Sangiovese]] and [[Pinot noir]] are well known to have a variety of clones. While there may be slight mutations to differentiate the various clones, all clones are considered genetically part of the same variety (i.e. Sangiovese or Pinot noir).&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;J. Robinson (ed) ''"The Oxford Companion to Wine"'' Third Edition  pgs 183-184 Oxford University Press 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''color mutation''' is a grape variety that while genetically similar to the original variety is considered unique enough to merit being considered its own variety. Both [[Pinot gris]] and [[Pinot blanc]] are color mutations of Pinot noir.&lt;ref name="WSET"/&gt;

A '''crossing''' is a new grape variety that was created by the cross pollination of two different varieties of the same species. [[Syrah]] is a crossing of two French ''Vitis vinifera'' species, [[Dureza]] from the [[Ardèche]] and [[Mondeuse blanche]] from [[Savoie (wine)|Savoie]].&lt;ref name="Wine Grapes"&gt;J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz ''Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours'' pgs 316, 528 &amp; 1023, Allen Lane 2012 {{ISBN|978-1-846-14446-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretically, every seedling (also known as a '''Selfling'''), even if its pollinated by a member of the same grape variety (i.e. such as two [[Merlot]] vines), is a crossing as any vine that results from the seed being planted will be a different grape variety distinct from either parent.&lt;ref name="WSET"/&gt;

A '''hybrid''' is a new grape variety that was produced from a cross pollination of two different grape species. In the early history of [[American wine]]making, grape growers would cross the European ''Vitis vinifera'' vines with American vine varieties such as ''Vitis labrusca'' to create French-American hybrids that were more resistant to American grape diseases such as [[downy (mildew)|downy]] and [[powdery mildew]] as well as [[phylloxera]]. When the [[phylloxera epidemic]] of the mid to late 19th century hit Europe, some growers in European wine regions experimented with using hybrids until a solution involving grafting American rootstocks to ''vinifera'' varieties was found. Eventually, the use of hybrids in wine production declined with their use formally outlawed by European [[wine law]]s in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="WSET"/&gt;

==Cuttings, grafting and layering==
[[File:Grape Vine Cuttings.jpg|right|thumb|Young vine cuttings in a nursery.]]
As commercial winemakers usually want to work with a desired grape variety that dependably produces a particular crop, most grapevines are propagated by clonal or massal selection of plant material. This can be accomplished in one of three ways.&lt;ref name="WSET"/&gt;

#Cuttings&amp;mdash;This involves a [[shoot]] taken from a mother vine and then planted where the shoot will eventually sprout a root system and regenerate itself into a full-fledged vine with trunk and [[canopy (vine)|canopy]]. Often new cuttings will be first planted in a nursery where it is allowed to develop for a couple years before being planted in the vineyard.&lt;ref name="WSET"/&gt;
#Grafting&amp;mdash;This involves removing the canopy and most of the trunk of an existing vine and replacing it with a cutting of a new vine that is sealed by a [[graft union]]. This technique, better known as '''head grafting''', is a quick and relatively inexpensive means of quickly changing over a vineyard as the new cutting is able to take advantage of an existing root system and is usually able to start producing a crop by the next growing season.&lt;ref name="WSET"/&gt;
#Layering&amp;mdash;In established vineyards where only a few vines need to be replaced within a row (such as vine lost to machine damage or disease), a new vine can be propagated by bending a cane from a neighboring vine into the ground and covering it with dirt. This segment of vine will soon begin sprouting its own independent root system while still being nourished by the connecting vine. Eventually, the connection between the two vines are severed allowing each vine to grow independently.&lt;ref name="WSET"/&gt;

==Clonal versus massal selection==
[[File:Vineyard 1.jpg|left|thumb|One criticism of clonal selection is that the use of only one or two clones greatly diminishes the genetic diversity of a vineyard.]]
Each cutting, taken from a mother vine, is a clone of that vine. The way that a vine grower selects these cuttings can be described as either '''clonal''' or '''massal selection'''. In clonal selection, an ideal plant within a vineyard or nursery that has exhibited the most desirable traits is selected with all cuttings taken from that single plant. In massal (or "mass") selection, cuttings are taken from several vines of the same variety that have collectively demonstrated desirable traits.&lt;ref name="WSET"/&gt;

[[File:Vineyard sign showing Cab Sauv clone.jpg|right|thumb|A vineyard in the Napa Valley showing which particular clone of Cabernet Sauvignon is planted in this block.]]
Historically, massal selection was the primary means of vineyard propagation, particularly in traditional vineyards where vines are only sporadically replaced, often by layering a cane from a neighboring vine. In the 1950s, the isolation and identification of desirable clones in nurseries and breeding stations lead to an increase in clonal selection with new vineyard plantings seeking out clones from well established vineyards and wine region. This trend towards clonal selection has seen some criticism from [[wine writer]]s and [[viticulturalist]]s who complain about "mono-clonal" viticulture that has the risk of producing wines that are overly similar and dull.&lt;ref name="WSET"/&gt;

Other criticisms of clonal selection involve the increased risk in vineyards lacking genetic diversity among its vines as well as the changing priorities in wine production. While many clones in the mid to late 20th century were isolated, some of the desirable traits exhibited by those clones (such as [[ripe (wine)|early ripening]] or high [[yield (wine)|yield]] potential) may no longer be as desirable today where other traits (such as low yields and drought resistance) may be more prized.&lt;ref name="WSET"/&gt;

[[File:'The Raising of Lazarus', tempera and gold on panel by Duccio di Buoninsegna, 1310–11, Kimbell Art Museum.jpg|thumb|300px|''The Raising of Lazarus'', by [[Duccio]], 1310–11]]

The '''raising of Lazarus''' or the '''resurrection of Lazarus'''  is a [[miracle of Jesus]] recounted only in the [[Gospel of John]] (John 11:1–44) in which Jesus brings [[Lazarus of Bethany]] back to life four days after his burial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Biblegateway |title=John 11:1-46 |url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%2011:1-11:46&amp;version=NIV|publisher=NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author-link=John Clowes (cleric)|last=Clowes|first=John|title=The Miracles of Jesus Christ|publisher=|location=Manchester, UK|date=1817 |page= 274}}&lt;/ref&gt; In John, this is the last of the miracles that Jesus performs before the Passion and his own resurrection.

==Background==
Lazarus is the brother of [[Martha]] and [[Mary of Bethany|Mary]]. The family lives in the village of Bethany, about two miles east of Jerusalem on the south-eastern slope of the Mount of Olives.

==Bible narrative==
[[File:Sebastiano del Piombo, The Raising of Lazarus.jpg|thumb|left|[[The Raising of Lazarus (Sebastiano del Piombo)|''The Raising of Lazarus'']], Oil on canvas, c. 1517–1519, [[Sebastiano del Piombo]] ([[National Gallery (London)|National Gallery]], [[London]])]]
According to [[John 11|John 11:1-44]], Jesus receives a message that Lazarus is ill, and his two sisters are seeking his help. Jesus tells his followers: "This sickness will not end in death. No, it is for God's glory so that God's Son may be glorified through it."

Jesus then delays his departure and leaves after two days. The disciples are afraid of returning to Judea, but Jesus says: "Our friend Lazarus is asleep, but I am going to awaken him." when the apostles misunderstand, he clarifies, "Lazarus is dead, and for your sake I am glad I was not there, so that you may believe."

When they arrive in [[Bethany (biblical village)|Bethany]], Lazarus has been dead and buried for four days. Before they enter the town, Martha, Lazarus' sister, comes to meet Jesus and tells him: "if you had been here, my brother would not have died". Jesus assures Martha that her brother will rise again and states: "I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me will live, even though he dies; and whoever lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?"

Martha's affirmation that she does truly believe and states, "Yes, Lord. I believe that you are the Messiah, the Son of God, who is to come into the world", is only the second time (after [[Nathanael (follower of Jesus)|Nathanael]]) that someone declares Jesus as Son of God and the first time someone equates him as 'Messiah' and 'Son of God' together. The only other time this happens in the entire gospel is in the explanation the author of the Gospel gives for writing his Gospel at the very end.

Upon entering the village, Jesus is met by Mary and the people who have come to console her. Upon seeing their grief and weeping, Jesus is deeply moved.  Then, after asking where he was buried, the shortest verse in the four Gospels, and the entire Bible is found - "[[Jesus wept]]". After that, Jesus asks for the stone of the grave to be removed, but Martha interjects that there will be a smell. To which Jesus responds, "Did I not tell you that if you believed, you would see the glory of God?"

So they take the stone away. Then Jesus looks up and says: "Father, I thank you that you have heard me. I knew that you always hear me, but I said this for the benefit of the people standing here, that they may believe that you sent me."

When he has said this, Jesus calls in a loud voice, "Lazarus, come forth!" The dead man comes out, his hands and feet wrapped with strips of linen, and a cloth around his face. Jesus says to them, "Take off the grave clothes and let him go."

Lazarus is mentioned again in the Gospel of John chapter 12. Six days before the [[Passover]] on which Jesus is [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucified]], Jesus returns to Bethany and Lazarus attends a supper that Martha, his sister, serves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||John|12:2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jesus and Lazarus together attract the attention of many Jews and the narrator states that the chief priests consider having Lazarus put to death because so many people have come to believe in Jesus on account of his raising Lazarus.

==Interpretation==
The miracle of the raising of Lazarus is the climax of John's "[[Seven signs in the Gospel of John|signs]]". It explains the crowds seeking Jesus on [[Palm Sunday]], and leads directly to the decision of [[Caiaphas]] and the [[Sanhedrin]] to plan to kill Jesus. Theologians Moloney and Harrington view the raising of Lazarus as a "pivotal miracle" which starts the chain of events that leads to the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]]. They consider it as a "resurrection that will lead to death", in that the raising of Lazarus will lead to the death of Jesus, the [[Son of God]], in [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]] which will reveal the Glory of God.&lt;ref&gt;Francis J. Moloney, Daniel J. Harrington, 1998 ''The Gospel of John'' Liturgical Press {{ISBN|0-8146-5806-7}} p. 325&lt;/ref&gt;  [[John Calvin|Calvin]] notes that "not only did Christ give a remarkable proof of his Divine power in raising Lazarus, but he likewise placed before our eyes a lively image of our future resurrection."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/commentaries/calvin/john/11.htm |title=John 11 Calvin's Commentaries |publisher=Biblehub.com |date= |accessdate=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard Charles Albert Holbrooke''' (April 24, 1941 – December 13, 2010) was an [[People of the United States|American]] [[diplomat]], magazine editor, author, professor, [[Peace Corps]] official, and [[investment bank]]er.

He was the only person to have held the position of [[United States Assistant Secretary of State|Assistant Secretary of State]] for two different regions of the world ([[Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs|Asia]] from 1977 to 1981 and [[Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs|Europe]] from 1994 to 1996).

From 1993 to 1994, he was [[United States Ambassador to Germany|U.S. Ambassador to Germany]]. Long well known in diplomatic and journalistic circles, Holbrooke achieved great public prominence when he, together with former Swedish prime minister [[Carl Bildt]], brokered a peace agreement among the warring factions in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] that led to the signing of the [[Dayton Peace Accords]], in 1995. Holbrooke was a leading contender to succeed the retiring [[Warren Christopher]] as [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] but was passed over in 1996 as President [[Bill Clinton]] chose [[Madeleine Albright]] instead. From 1999 to 2001, Holbrooke served as [[United States Ambassadors to the United Nations|U.S. Ambassador]] to the [[United Nations]].

He was an adviser to the [[United States presidential election, 2004|Presidential campaign]] of [[U.S. Senate|Senator]] [[John Kerry]] in 2004. Holbrooke then joined the [[Hillary Rodham Clinton presidential campaign, 2008|Presidential campaign]] of Senator [[Hillary Clinton]] and became a top foreign policy adviser. Holbrooke was considered a likely candidate for [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] had Kerry or Hillary Clinton been elected President. In January 2009, Holbrooke was appointed as a special adviser on Pakistan and Afghanistan, working under President [[Barack Obama]] and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.&lt;ref name="Foreign Policy" /&gt; He served until he died from [[complications (medical)|complications]] of an [[aortic dissection]] on December 13, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/richard-holbrooke-american-full-69115|title=Richard Holbrooke: An American in Full|last=Alter|first=Jonathan|date=14 December 2010|work=Newsweek|access-date=29 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holbrooke's unfulfilled ambition was to become Secretary of State; he, along with [[George F. Kennan|George Kennan]] and [[Charles E. Bohlen|Chip Bohlen]], were considered among the most influential U.S. diplomats who never achieved [[Cabinet of the United States|cabinet rank]]. Several considered Holbrooke's role in the [[Dayton Accords]] to merit the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2010/12/14/holbrooke-in-the-trenches.html|title=Holbrooke in the Trenches|last=Moreau|first=Ron|date=14 December 2010|work=Newsweek|access-date=29 April 2010|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2011/01/16/richard-holbrooke-s-lonely-mission.html|title=Richard Holbrooke's Lonely Mission|last=Alter|first=Jonathan|date=16 January 2011|work=Newsweek|access-date=29 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2010/12/14/richard-holbrooke-a-disappointed-man.html|title=Richard Holbrooke: A Disappointed Man|author=|date=14 December 2010|website=newsweek.com|accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2010/12/14/an-american-in-full.html|title=An American in Full|author=|date=14 December 2010|website=newsweek.com|accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Holbrooke was born on April 24, 1941, in New York City, to Dan Holbrooke, a doctor, and Trudi Kearl ([[Married and maiden names|née]] Moos), a potter; brother, Andrew, survives him.&lt;ref name=nytobit /&gt;&lt;ref name=SciolinoE-TNYT-1998-06-19&gt;Sciolino, Elaine.&amp;nbsp;– "Man in the News&amp;nbsp;– Richard C. Holbrooke; A Tough Man (Some Say Brutal) for a Tough Job".&amp;nbsp;– ''[[The New York Times]]''.&amp;nbsp;– June 19, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Holbrooke's mother, whose Jewish family fled Hamburg in 1933 for Buenos Aires before coming to New York, took him to Quaker meetings on Sundays. She stated: "I was an atheist, his father was an atheist... We never thought of giving Richard a Jewish upbringing. The [[Meeting for worship|Quaker meetings]] seemed interesting."&lt;ref name=CohenR-TNYTM-1995-12-17&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/17/magazine/taming-the-bullies-of-bosnia.html?pagewanted=all|title=Taming the Bullies of Bosnia|publisher=The New York Times Magazine&amp;nbsp;– (c/o NYTimes.com)|author=Roger Cohen|date=December 17, 1995|accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holbrooke's father, who died of cancer when Richard was 15 years old,&lt;ref name=nytobit /&gt; was born of [[Polish Jewish]] parents in Warsaw and took the name Holbrooke after migrating to the United States in 1939. The original family name was Goldbrajch.&lt;ref name=naturalization&gt;Petition for Naturalization of Dan Holbrooke, U.S. District, Southern District New York Court #487977 dated 22 May 1944&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Scarsdale High School]],&lt;ref name=toughman&gt;{{cite news |title=A Tough Man (Some Say Brutal) for a Tough Job |author=Sciolino, Elaine |publisher=New York Times |date=1998-06-19 |accessdate=2010-12-15 |page=A1 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/19/world/man-in-the-news-richard-c-holbrooke-a-tough-man-some-say-brutal-for-a-tough-job.html?pagewanted=all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holbrooke earned a Bachelor of Arts from [[Brown University]] in 1962, attending on a full-tuition scholarship.&lt;ref name=toughman /&gt;&lt;ref name=patch&gt;{{cite web |title=Ambassador Richard Holbrooke, Scarsdale Native, Dies |author=Reynolds, William Joseph |date=2010-12-14 |accessdate=2010-12-15 |publisher=[[Patch (website)|Patch.com]] |url=http://scarsdale.patch.com/articles/ambassador-richard-holbrooke-scarsdale-native-dies }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later a [[fellow]] at the [[Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs]] at [[Princeton University]], leaving in 1970.&lt;ref name=patch /&gt;

== Career ==

=== Vietnam (1962–1969) ===
In 1962, Holbrooke graduated from [[Brown University]], where he was inspired by President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s call to service to enter government work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Holbrooke interview with the Brown Journal of World Affairs|url= http://www.bjwa.org/article.php?id=L2wTriBMg5jEx1Q88B27ovaGuq1pAWN4Lgc0v7cJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PBS-MLP-NH-RCH&gt;{{cite web|title=Richard C. Holbrooke| url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/bio/holbrooke_bio.html|publisher=''[[The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer]]''.&amp;nbsp;– [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]].&amp;nbsp;– MacNeil/Lehrer Productions}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few weeks after college graduation, Holbrooke entered the [[United States Foreign Service|Foreign Service]]. A year later, after Vietnamese language training, he began six years of service in and on [[Vietnam]]. He served first in the [[Mekong Delta]], as a civilian representative for the [[United States Agency for International Development|Agency for International Development]] working on the [[Civil Operations and Revolutionary Development Support|rural Pacification Program]]. This involved supporting the [[South Vietnam]] government with economic development and enacting local political reforms. Holbrooke then moved to the [[US Embassy, Saigon]] where he became a staff assistant to Ambassadors [[Maxwell Taylor]] and [[Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.]]&lt;ref name=PBS-MLP-NH-RCH /&gt; During this time, he served with many other young diplomats who would play a major role in [[American foreign policy]] in the decades ahead, including [[John Negroponte]], [[Anthony Lake]], [[Frank G. Wisner]], [[Les Aspin]] and [[Peter Tarnoff]]. As the [[Vietnam War]] escalated, President [[Lyndon Johnson]] formed a team of Vietnam experts to work in the White House under the former head of the [[Phoenix Program]], [[Robert Komer|R.W. Komer]], in an operation that was separate from the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]]. As a rising young diplomat with significant experience in the country, Holbrooke was asked to join the group when he was only twenty-four years old.

Following his time in the [[White House]], Holbrooke served as a special assistant to [[Under Secretary of State|Under Secretaries of State]] (then the number-two position in the State Department) [[Nicholas Katzenbach]] and [[Elliot Richardson]]. In 1968, Holbrooke was asked to be part of the American delegation to the 1968 [[Paris Peace Accords|Paris peace talks]], which was led by former New York Governor [[Averell Harriman]] and [[Deputy Secretary of Defense]] [[Cyrus Vance]]. He also drafted a volume of the now famous [[Pentagon Papers]], a [[top-secret]] report on the government's decision-making in Vietnam. Following these assignments, Holbrooke spent a year as a mid-career fellow at the [[Woodrow Wilson School]] at Princeton University.

=== Morocco and ''Foreign Policy'' (1970–1976) ===
{{One source section|date=February 2016}}

In 1970, at his own request, Holbrooke was assigned to be the [[Peace Corps]] Director in [[Morocco]]. After two years, he left the [[United States Foreign Service|Foreign Service]] to become the Managing Editor of the magazine ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' from 1972–1976.&lt;ref name="charlotterotary.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=R. Holbrooke's Biography|url=http://www.charlotterotary.org/holbrooke.htm|publisher=Charlotte Rotary|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807174036/http://www.charlotterotary.org/holbrooke.htm|archivedate=2008-08-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time (1974–75), he was a consultant to the President's Commission on the Organization of the Government for the Conduct of Foreign Policy and was a contributing editor to [[Newsweek|''Newsweek International'']].&lt;ref name="charlotterotary.org" /&gt;

=== Carter Administration (1977–1981) ===
In the summer of 1976, Holbrooke left ''Foreign Policy'' to serve as campaign coordinator for national security affairs to [[Governor of Georgia|Governor]] [[Jimmy Carter]] (D-GA) in his bid for the White House. During the campaign, Holbrooke helped Carter prepare for his foreign policy debates with President [[Gerald Ford]]. After Carter's victory, Holbrooke followed in the footsteps of such diplomatic mentors as [[Philip Habib]], Dean Rusk and [[Averell Harriman]] and, on March 31, 1977, became [[Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs]], making him the youngest person ever to hold that position, a post he held until 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Assistant Secretaries of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs |url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ho/po/12046.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013025458/http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ho/po/12046.htm |archivedate=October 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While at State, he was a top adviser to Secretary of State Cyrus Vance. During his service, he oversaw a warming with [[Cold War]] adversaries in the region, culminating in the normalization of relations with China in December 1978.&lt;ref name=PBS-MLP-NH-RCH /&gt; He was also deeply involved in bringing hundreds of thousands of Indochinese refugees to the United States, thus beginning a lifelong involvement with the refugee issue.

=== East Timor controversy ===
{{One source section|date=February 2016}}

In August 1977, then [[Assistant Secretary of State]], Holbrooke traveled to [[Indonesia]] to meet with [[Suharto|President Suharto]] in the midst of [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor|Indonesia's occupation]] of [[East Timor]], in which over 100,000 East Timorese were ultimately killed or starved to death. According to Brad Simpson, director of the Indonesia and East Timor Documentation Project at the National Security Archives, Holbrooke had visited officially to press for human rights reform but, after meeting Suharto, had instead praised him for Indonesia's [[human rights]] improvements, for the steps that Indonesia had taken to open East Timor to the West, and for allowing a delegation of congressmen to enter the territory under strict military guard, where they were greeted by staged celebrations welcoming the Indonesian armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2008/1/28/the_democrats_suharto_bill_clinton_richard|title=The Democrats &amp; Suharto: Bill Clinton &amp; Richard Holbrooke Questioned on Their Support for Brutal Indonesian Dictatorship|publisher=Democracy Now!|date=|accessdate=2010-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wall Street years (1981–1993) ===
In January 1981, Holbrooke left government and became both senior advisor to [[Lehman Brothers]]&lt;ref name=nytobit /&gt; and vice president of Public Strategies, a [[consulting firm]] he formed with [[James A. Johnson (businessman)|James A. Johnson]], a former top aide to [[Walter Mondale]]. From 1985 until 1993, Holbrooke served as managing director of Lehman Brothers. During this time, he co-authored ''Counsel to the President'', ''The New York Times'' best-selling memoirs of legendary Democratic wise man and Defense Secretary [[Clark Clifford]], published in 1991. He was a top policy adviser to then-[[U.S. Senator|Senator]] [[Al Gore]] (D-[[Tennessee|TN]]) during [[Al Gore presidential campaign, 1988|his 1988 campaign]] for the Democratic presidential nomination. And four years later he advised [[Bill Clinton]], in [[Bill Clinton presidential campaign, 1992|his quest]] for the White House.

Holbrooke also remained deeply engaged in prominent foreign policy issues. He visited Bosnia twice in 1992 as a private citizen and a member of the board of [[Refugees International]], witnessing firsthand the damage and devastating human costs of the conflict. This experience committed Holbrooke to pursuing a more aggressive policy in Balkans and, in a memo to his colleagues, he urged that "Bosnia will be the key test of American policy in Europe. We must therefore succeed in whatever we attempt."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Holbrooke |first=Richard |title=To End a War |year=1999 |publisher=[[Random House]] |location=New York, New York |page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== U.S. Ambassador to Germany (1993–1994) ===
In 1993, after [[Bill Clinton]] became President, Holbrooke was initially slated to be Ambassador to Japan due to his depth of knowledge and long experience in Asian affairs. However, this appointment eventually went to former Vice President [[Walter Mondale]], and Holbrooke unexpectedly was appointed Ambassador to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Holbrooke |first=Richard |title=To End a War |year=1999 |publisher=[[Random House]] |location=New York, New York |page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, Holbrooke was also a member of the Carnegie Commission on America and a Changing World and Chairman and principal author of the bipartisan Commission on Government and Renewal, sponsored by the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York|Carnegie Foundation]] and the [[Peterson Institute]]. He was Chairman and principal author of the "Memo to the President-Elect: Harnessing Process to Purpose," a blue-ribbon Commission report sponsored by the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]] and the [[Institute for International Economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Special Report: Policymaking for a New Era |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19921201faessay5911/carnegie-endowment-for-international-peace-institute-for-international-economics/special-report-policymaking-for-a-new-era.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206151530/http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19921201faessay5911/carnegie-endowment-for-international-peace-institute-for-international-economics/special-report-policymaking-for-a-new-era.html |archivedate=December 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holbrooke served in Germany during a dramatic moment: only a few years after [[German reunification]], he helped shape U.S. relations with a new Germany. A highlight of his tenure was President Bill Clinton's visit to Berlin in July 1994, when thousands of [[Germans]] crammed the streets to welcome the American leader.&lt;ref name=JehlD-TNYT-1994-07-13&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F00E4D7123FF930A25754C0A962958260&amp;scp=2&amp;sq=clinton+berlin&amp;st=nyt|publisher=The New York Times|title=With a Few Strides, Clinton Celebrates Germany's Unity|date=July 13, 1994|author=Jehl, Douglas}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in Germany, Holbrooke also was a key figure in shaping the U.S. policy to promote [[NATO]] enlargement, as well as its approach to the war in Bosnia.

In 1994, while serving as U.S. Ambassador to Germany, he conceived the idea of a cultural exchange center between the people of Berlin and Americans. With [[Richard von Weizsäcker]], former [[President of Germany]], and [[Henry A.

=== Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs (1994–1996) ===

In 1994, Holbrooke returned to Washington to become the [[Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs|assistant secretary for European and Canadian Affairs]], a position he held until 1996, when he resigned for personal reasons (he had recently married the author [[Kati Marton]] and wished to return to New York). While assistant secretary, Holbrooke led the effort to implement the policy to enlarge NATO and had the distinction of leading the negotiation team charged with resolving the Balkans crisis. In Paris in December 1995, he was the chief architect of the [[Dayton Peace Accords]] which ended a three-and-a-half-year-long war in Bosnia.&lt;ref name="AMANPOUR, CHRISTIANE 2011"&gt;AMANPOUR, CHRISTIANE. "Holbrooke." ''New Republic'' 242.1 (2011): 9–10. BusinessSource Elite.

=== Balkan envoy (1996–1999) ===
{{external media| float = right| width = 230px | video1 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?106538-1/end-war ''Booknotes'' interview with Holbrooke on ''To End a War'', July 26, 1998], [[C-SPAN]]}}
Upon leaving the State Department, Holbrooke was asked by President Clinton to become, as a private citizen, a special envoy to the Balkans given his distinguished service in the region. Holbrooke left his post as assistant secretary of state for European and Canadian affairs and joined [[Credit Suisse First Boston]], eventually taking the position of Vice Chairman. In 1997, Holbrooke became a special envoy to [[Cyprus]] and the Balkans on a pro-bono basis as a private citizen. During 1998 and 1999, in his capacity as special presidential envoy, Holbrooke worked to end the conflict between the armed forces of the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] and the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] (KLA), who were fighting for an independent [[Kosovo]] in the [[Kosovo War]]. Holbrooke returned to Bosnia two years later to the city of [[Sarajevo]]. In March 1999 he traveled to [[Belgrade]] to deliver the [[ultimatum]] to [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] [[president]] [[Slobodan Milošević]] before the NATO attack began.&lt;ref name=PerlezJ-TNYT-1999-03-22&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E00E0D71031F931A15750C0A96F958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all|title=Conflict in the Balkans: The Overview; Milosevic to Get One 'Last Chance' to Avoid Bombing|last=Perlez|first=Jane|date=1999-03-22|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holbrooke wrote numerous articles about his experiences in the Balkans, and in 1998, published the widely acclaimed book, ''To End a War'', a memoir of his time as the chief negotiator of the [[Dayton Peace Accords]], ending the Bosnian civil war. ''[[The New York Times]]'' ranked the book as one of the eleven best books of the year in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Editors' Choice: The Best Books of 1998|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/12/06/reviews/981206.06editcht.html|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Radovan Karadžić]] and [[Muhamed Sacirbey]], ex-Bosnian Foreign Minister, Holbrooke signed an agreement with Karadžić that if the latter withdrew from politics he would not be sent to the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|Hague tribunal]].&lt;ref name="press-deal"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=65316&amp;sectionid=351020606|title=Karadzic-Holbrooke deal confirmed |date=2008-08-01|publisher=Press TV|accessdate=2008-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holbrooke denied these terms, saying Karadžić's statement was "a flat-out lie."&lt;ref name=RobertsonN-CNN-2008-07-31&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/europe/08/01/karadzic.trial/index.html|title=Karadzic Details 'Deal with U.S. to Vanish'|last=Robertson|first=Nic|authorlink=Nic Robertson|date=July 31, 2008|publisher=CNN|accessdate=November 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations (1999–2001) ===
In August 1999, Holbrooke was sworn-in as the 22nd [[U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations]], replacing [[Bill Richardson]]. During his tenure, Holbrooke was known for innovation and for achieving diplomatic breakthroughs that settled a series of longstanding tensions in the United States' relationship with the UN. His highest-profile accomplishment was negotiating a historic deal between the United States and the UN's then 188-Member States to settle the bulk of [[United States and the United Nations#Arrearage|arrears owed by the United States to the United Nations]]. The deal, achieved with the agreement of the UN's entire membership in late December 2000, lowered the rate of UN dues paid by the United States to the UN, fulfilling the terms of a U.S. law championed by Senators [[Jesse Helms]] (R-[[North Carolina|NC]]) and [[Joseph Biden]] (D-[[Delaware|DE]]). In return for the reduction, the United States paid the UN over $900 million in back dues.&lt;ref name=CrossetteB-TNYT-1999-12-22&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9406E0DE1739F931A15751C1A96F958260|work=The New York Times|title=U.S. Saves Its U.N. Voting Rights With a Payment of Back Dues|last=Crossette|first=Barbara|authorlink=Barbara Crossette|date=December 22, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holbrooke secured a reduction in U.S. dues to the UN despite a booming American economy by enfolding the U.S. position within a broad push to update the UN's long-outdated [[financial system]]. As negotiations reached a critical phase in the fall of 2000, Holbrooke bridged a gap between what the United States was legally permitted to pay and the amounts the rest of the UN membership were willing to shoulder by securing an unprecedented contribution by billionaire [[Ted Turner]], founder of the [[UN Foundation]]. Holbrooke and his team received a standing ovation in the [[United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] when the terms of the deal were presented.

Holbrooke's other achievements as UN Ambassador included getting the [[United Nations Security Council]] to debate and pass a resolution on [[HIV/AIDS]], the first time that body had treated [[public health]] as a matter of global security. In January 2000, Holbrooke used the United States' presidency of the UN Security Council to spotlight a series of crises in Africa, holding six consecutive UN debates that brought together leaders from the region and the across the globe, including former South African President [[Nelson Mandela]] and then [[U.S. Vice President]] [[Al Gore]], to catalyze more effective UN interventions in the Democratic Republic of Congo, [[Angola]], and elsewhere. Holbrooke decried a "double standard" whereby African conflicts received insufficient global attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Holbrooke Intends to Keep Emphasis on Africa|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2000/02/000204-africa-usia1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, Holbrooke led a UN Security Council delegation in a series of diplomatic negotiations throughout Africa, including to the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], [[Zambia]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Rwanda]], and [[Uganda]]. Holbrooke also secured membership for [[Israel]] in the UN's [[Western European and Others Group|Western European and Others]] regional group, ending Israel's historic exclusion from regional group deliberations and allowing it to, for the first time, stand for election to leadership positions in UN sub-bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Press Release: [http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/About+the+Ministry/MFA+Spokesman/2000/Israel+Accepted+to+WEOG.htm Israel Accepted to WEOG An Achievement for Israeli Diplomacy].&amp;nbsp;– Ministry of Foreign Affairs.&amp;nbsp;– The State of Israel.&amp;nbsp;– May 28, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; During the final weeks of his term, Holbrooke secured consultative status at the United Nations for [[Hadassah]], the Jewish women's service organization, overcoming strenuous objections from certain [[Arab]] delegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2001/01/17/2001-01-17_un_votes_to_extend_its_ears_.html |publisher=[[Daily News (New York)|''Daily News'']] |title=UN Votes To Extend Its Ears to Hadassah |date=January 17, 2001 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124030250/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2001/01/17/2001-01-17_un_votes_to_extend_its_ears_.html |archivedate=January 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== GBCHealth ====
In January 2000, when the United States was in the rotating presidency of the [[UN Security Council]], Ambassador Holbrooke held an unprecedented meeting of the Security Council to discuss [[AIDS]] in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Global Business Coalition: [http://www.gbcimpact.org/live/feature/strategy.php Strategy Page]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918044336/http://www.gbcimpact.org/live/feature/strategy.php |date=September 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; No Security Council session in the history of the UN had ever been devoted to a health issue prior to this historic meeting. Vice President [[Al Gore]] presided over the Security Council and declared that AIDS was a security threat to all nations.&lt;ref&gt;Al Gore Support Center [http://algoresupportcenter.com/accomplishments5.html Accomplishments Archive] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718105743/http://algoresupportcenter.com/accomplishments5.html |date=2008-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon leaving the UN a year later, Holbrooke took over a nearly moribund [[NGO]] that was intended to mobilize businesses and corporations in the fight against AIDS. At the time, it had 17 members. Over the next six years, Holbrooke turned this organization—originally called the Global Business Council on HIV/AIDS—into a worldwide organization with over 225 members.&lt;ref&gt;Global Business Coalition on HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria:  [http://www.gbcimpact.org/itcs_node/0/0/article/905 "A Growing Business Movement"].&lt;/ref&gt; It expanded to include [[malaria]] and [[tuberculosis]], becoming the ''Global Business Coalition on HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria'' in 2006. In 2011, the organization became GBCHealth and expanded its mandate to include an array of health issues. GBCHealth is the official focal point for mobilizing the business community in support of [[The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]], and has grown into an important part of the ongoing war against these three diseases.&lt;ref&gt;Global Business Coalition on HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria:  [http://eforums.healthdev.org/read/messages?id=5527 "New Group to Galvanize Business Role in Combating AIDS, TB and Malaria"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726144406/http://eforums.healthdev.org/read/messages?id=5527 |date=2011-07-26 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign ===
{{One source section|date=February 2016}}

Holbrooke was Clinton's lead foreign policy advisor in her campaign for president and was believed to be her preferred choice for Secretary of State. When Obama [[United States presidential election, 2004|defeated]] Clinton and selected her as Secretary of State, Holbrooke was her preferred option for [[Deputy Secretary of State]], but was vetoed by Obama.&lt;ref name="Foreign Policy"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/03/04/the-inside-story-of-how-the-white-house-let-diplomacy-fail-in-afghanistan/|title=The Inside Story of How the White House Let Diplomacy Fail in Afghanistan |last1=Nasr |first1=Vali |date=March–April 2013 |work=Foreign Policy |accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RichardHolbrookeHSAug09.jpg|thumb|right|Holbrooke in Herat, Afghanistan, in August 2009 to be briefed by leaders of the coalition forces on the overall security of western Afghanistan.]]
In January 2009, Holbrooke was appointed by President Obama as special representative for [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/08/us/politics/08holbrooke.html|title=Back on World Stage, a Larger-Than-Life Holbrooke|first=Jodi|last=Kantor|date=|website=nytimes.com|accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that position, he helped kill an initiative to "back the creation of a new [[United Nations|UN]] special envoy empowered to pursue peace talks with the [[Taliban]]."&lt;ref&gt;Borger, Julian (2010-12-14) [https://www.theguardian.com/world/julian-borger-global-security-blog/2010/dec/14/afghanistan-obama-administration Afghanistan after Holbrooke], ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt; He also asserted that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;one of the most cost-effective steps [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] could take would be to boost the agriculture sector of [[Afghanistan]], which in years past had been a productive and profitable source of exports. Replicate the past success, he said, and Afghans would have money and jobs—and that, in turn, would create stability in the country. He called for 'a complete rethink' of the drug problem in Afghanistan, suggesting that draconian eradication programs were bound to fail.&lt;ref name=Corn&gt;[[David Corn|Corn, David]] (2010-12-14) [http://motherjones.com/mojo/2010/12/richard-holbrooke-death-afghanistan Richard Holbrooke's Unfinished Business], ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, according to [[David Corn]], "Holbrooke's skill set did not lead to much accomplishment in [[Afghanistan]]. He never worked out a productive relationship with Afghan President [[Hamid Karzai]] … He butted heads with other administration officials and was dismissed by European colleagues. He brokered no breakthroughs."&lt;ref name=Corn /&gt;

On March 20, 2007, he appeared on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' to mediate in what [[Stephen Colbert]] (or rather, [[Stephen Colbert (character)|his television alter-ego]]) saw as [[Willie Nelson]] infringing on his ice cream flavor time. Holbrooke was the 'ambassador on call' and after a short mediation process the two parties agreed to taste each other's [[Ben and Jerry's]] ice cream to make amends. He subsequently sang "[[On the Road Again (Willie Nelson song)|On the Road Again]]" in a trio with Colbert and Nelson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/84015/march-20-2007/willie-nelson|title=The Colbert Report|author=|date=|website=Comedy Central|accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holbrooke was an Eminent Member of the [[Sergio Vieira de Mello Foundation]] until his death.

In June 2008, [[Conde Nast Portfolio]] reported that Holbrooke and his son allegedly got multiple below-rate loans at [[Countrywide Financial]] because the corporation considered them "FOA's"—"[[Countrywide Financial#"Friends of Angelo" VIP program|Friends of Angelo]]" (Countrywide Chief Executive [[Angelo Mozilo]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portfolio.com/news-markets/top-5/2008/06/12/Countrywide-Loan-Scandal Countrywide's Many 'Friends'] Conde Nast Portfolio, June 12, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

A documentary titled [[The Diplomat (2015 film)|''The Diplomat'']] centered on the legacy of Holbrooke's career appeared on HBO in the fall of 2015. The documentary was directed by his son, [[David Holbrooke]], and features notes from Holbrooke's "secret audio diary" which "he dictated on a near daily basis from August 2010 until his death".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/23/world/middleeast/richard-c-holbrookes-diary-of-disagreement-with-the-obama-administration.html|title=Richard C.

== Positions ==
In January 2001, Holbrooke said that "[[Iraq]] will be one of the major issues facing the incoming [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] at the United Nations."  Further, "[[Saddam Hussein]]'s activities continue to be unacceptable and, in my view, dangerous to the region and, indeed, to the world, not only because he possesses the potential for [[weapons of mass destruction]] but because of the very nature of his regime. His willingness to be cruel internally is not unique in the world, but the combination of that and his willingness to export his problems makes him a clear and present danger at all times."&lt;ref name="usdmti"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usembassy.it/file2001_01/alia/a1011102.htm|title=Holbrooke: Iraq Will Be a Major UN Issue for Bush Administration|date=2001-01-11|publisher=United States Diplomatic Mission to Italy|accessdate=2009-02-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125045345/http://www.usembassy.it/file2001_01/alia/a1011102.htm|archivedate=2009-01-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 24, 2007, Holbrooke delivered the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]'s weekly radio address and called for "a new strategy in Iraq", involving "a careful, phased redeployment of U.S. troops" and a "new diplomatic offensive in the Gulf region to help stabilize Iraq."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Former U.N.

A street in Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, is named after Holbrooke, albeit in Albanian transliteration, "Riçard Holbruk".

He was younger brother of [[James Arndell Youl]]. He grew up and was educated in England, graduating from the [[University of St Andrews]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DEATH OF DR YOUL|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article9189282|accessdate=15 December 2014|publisher=The Argus|date=7 August 1897}}&lt;/ref&gt; moving to Victoria when he returned to Australia. He was a noted medical practitioner, becoming in 1852 a founding member and secretary of the Victoria Medical Association. In 1853 he was appointed assistant surgeon to the Melbourne Gaols and a magistrate and district coroner for [[Bourke, New South Wales]]. During 1854 he was acting coroner for Melbourne, and from 1854 to 1867 he was visiting justice to penal establishments in Victoria. He became Melbourne Coroner permanently in 1857 and lost office in 1878 due to Premier [[Graham Berry]]'s purge of civil servants claiming being unable to pay them. He regained office after the controversy calmed down. During his career he was reputed to have conducted over 12,000 inquests. He was a member of the Central Board of Health from 1855 until 1884 and its president during 1879–84. He was a member of the Medical Board of Victoria from 1858 and president from 1885 to 1897, Chairman of the Police Medical Board in 1892 and founded the Victorian Infant Asylum in 1877. He was said to have been quite liberal for his time, being opposed to the death penalty and the internment of juvenile offenders and the insane with normal criminals. He argued that prostitution should be legalised so it could be controlled safety. He died in 1897.&lt;ref name="youl richard adb"&gt;{{cite web|title=Youl, Richard (1821–1897)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/youl-richard-4900|website=adb.anu.edu.au|publisher=Australian Dictionary of Biography|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sandro Rosa do Nascimento''' (July 7, 1978 – June 12, 2000) was the perpetrator of the Bus 174 hostage crisis in [[Jardim Botânico, Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]]. Nascimento boarded a public bus, intending to rob the passengers.  However, the incident developed into a hostage situation, which was broadcast live by most Brazilian national television channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2003/12/05/AR2005033116317.html|title='Bus 174': Brazil Held Hostage|first=Desson|last=Thomson|date=5 December 2003|publisher=|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
According to Nascimento's relatives, he witnessed the murder of his mother. Shortly after the incident, Nascimento ran away from his home to vagabond on the streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Elza da Silva não era mãe de Sandro |author= |url=http://www2.uol.com.br/JC/_2000/2406/br2406j.htm |newspaper=[[Universo Online]] |date=24 June 2000 |accessdate=19 April 2013|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At one point, Nascimento resided in the area of [[Candelária Church|Candelaria]], a historical church in Rio de Janeiro, where he witnessed the [[Candelária massacre|Candelaria church massacre]] on July 23, 1993. Brazilian [[Military Police of Rio de Janeiro State|policemen]] killed eight adolescents and injured several others. Nascimento was unharmed, and cited the event during his hostage situation.

==Bus 174 hostage situation==
On June 12, 2000, Nascimento boarded a public bus (Ônibus #174) in [[Jardim Botânico, Rio de Janeiro]]. He was armed with a [[9 mm caliber|.38 caliber]] [[revolver]], with the intention to [[robbery|rob]] the passengers. Moments after Nascimento announced the robbery, a passenger signaled to a vehicle from the [[Military Police of Rio de Janeiro State|Rio de Janeiro military police]], prompting the police to intercept the bus.

Nascimento took the passengers of the bus [[hostage]].  The bus was soon surrounded by police officers, television news crews, and onlooking civilians.  Nascimento at first assured the passengers, the police, the television crews and their viewers that he did not intend to kill anyone. Nascimento demanded weapons and a new bus driver (since the original driver had escaped through a window) to aid in his escape from the scene. As his demands went on ungranted, he threatened to kill a hostage at six o'clock.

Nascimento singled out several of the hostages for dramatic demonstrations over the course of the event. He repeatedly used the hostages as [[human shield]]s. Nearing seven o'clock, Nascimento fired his revolver, bluffing the execution of hostage Janaína Lopes Neves to those outside the bus. The other hostages were told to act as if the execution had occurred.

At 06:50 PM local time, Nascimento exited the bus, using schoolteacher Geisa Firmo Gonçalves as a human shield.  As Nascimento's attention was being held in one direction, an officer armed with a [[submachine gun]] approached Nascimento from behind.  Just prior to the officer reaching him, Nascimento turned directly toward the officer and reacted by jerking away from the officer, falling to the ground, taking Gonçalves with him.  The officer reacted by continuing his advance and firing two or three shots at Nascimento while doing so. The first shot struck Gonçalves in the face while none of the other shots struck Nascimento. Nascimento then proceeded to fire three shots at Gonçalves, killing her. Officers then converged on Nascimento and Gonçalves as they lay on the ground. Surrounding crowds rushed the area. Nascimento was immobilised by the police and taken into custody.

Nascimento could be seen to be alive at the time he was placed into a police vehicle. Some time after being taken into custody, he died of [[asphyxiation]]. There were later assertions that Nascimento was intentionally killed by the police, and that his death was revenge for the public nature of the hostage event. The officers who took him into custody were charged with murder; after the jury trial, they were found not guilty.

Gonçalves was shot four times. Police reports concluded she had been shot once in the face by the advancing police officer and then three times in the back by Nascimento in the ensuing struggle. The officer's shot was ruled unintentional by a court.

== The bus route ==
The number "174" was used to identify a specific bus route between [[Central do Brasil]] and [[Gávea]]. Due to the stigma caused by this incident, the route was rebadged as "158" in November 2001.

== Films ==
At least two films have been made depicting the events of the hostage crisis.

The 2002 documentary film ''[[Bus 174]]'' retells the incident, discussing the life of Nascimento, and speculates on the social factors that led him to actions. The film contains a large amount of original video footage of the event, and recounts from several people surrounding the event, including the hostages, family of Nascimento, police officials, and news reporters.

''[[Última Parada 174]]'' relates a fictionalized account of the life of Nascimento, street kid in Rio de Janeiro that survived the Candelaria massacre, and in 2000, hijacked a bus. On September 16, 2008 the film was chosen by the Ministry of Culture as the representative of Brazil in the Oscar competition for best foreign film at the ceremony in 2009.

'''Mar Shimun XVII Abraham''' (also '''Simon XVII Abraham''' or '''Auraham''') was [[List of Patriarchs of the Church of the East|Patriarch]] of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] from c. 1820 to 1861.{{sfn|Baum|Winkler|2003|p=127, 175}}

He led the church from [[Konak, Hakkari|Qodshanis]], (modern [[Konak, Hakkari]]) in southeastern [[Turkey]], and tried to maintain good relations with local [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] authorities. In 1843, he was faced with renewed hostilities from [[Kurds|Kurdish]] warlords, who attacked many Christian villages and killed 10,000 men, taking away women and children as captives, and forcing Patriarch to take refuge in [[Mosul]].{{sfn|Wilmshurst|2000|p=33, 212}} He is buried in the Church of Mar Shalita in Turkey.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26958">'''Social cognitive neuroscience''' is the scientific study of the biological processes underpinning [[social cognition]]. Social cognition refers to the psychological processes that mediate thinking about others and the self at four stages: encoding, storage, retrieval, and processing. Social cognitive neuroscience uses the [[Epistemology|epistemological]] foundations of [[cognitive neuroscience]] and [[social neuroscience]]. Social cognitive neuroscience employs human [[neuroimaging]], typically using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]], [[electroencephalography]], and [[magnetoencephalography]]. Brain stimulation techniques such as [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] and [[transcranial direct-current stimulation]] are also used. In nonhuman animals, direct electrophysiological recordings of single cells and neuronal populations are utilized for investigating lower-level social cognitive functions.&lt;ref name="Lieberman2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lieberman|first1=MD|date=2007|title=Social cognitive neuroscience: a review of core processes.|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=58|pages=259–89|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.58.110405.085654|pmid=17002553}}{{update-inline|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WUuGS3gr9W4C&amp;pg=PA39|title=Social Psychology: Handbook of Basic Principles|last=Kruglanski|first=Arie W.|last2=Higgins|first2=Edward Tory|date=2007-04-19|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=9781572309180|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Social.html?id=IeW1mAEACAAJ|title=Social: Why Our Brains are Wired to Connect|last=Lieberman|first=Matthew D.|date=2013-10-10|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780199645046|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Functional Anatomy ==

Social cognition is primarily subserved by two dissociable [[Large_scale_brain_networks|macro-scale brain networks]]: the [[mirror neuron|mirror neuron system]] (MNS) and [[default mode network]] (DMN). MNS is thought to represent and identify observable actions (e.g. reaching for a cup) that are used by DMN to infer unobservable mental states, traits, and intentions (e.g. thirsty).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015-11-01|title=Understanding intentions from actions: Direct perception, inference, and the roles of mirror and mentalizing systems|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|language=en|volume=36|pages=426–433|doi=10.1016/j.concog.2015.03.012|pmid=25864592|issn=1053-8100|last1=Catmur|first1=Caroline}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Theoryofmind2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Molnar-Szakacs|first=Istvan|last2=Uddin|first2=Lucina Q.|date=2013|title=Self-Processing and the Default Mode Network: Interactions with the Mirror Neuron System|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|language=English|volume=7|pages=571|doi=10.3389/fnhum.2013.00571|pmid=24062671|pmc=3769892|issn=1662-5161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concordantly, the activation onset of MNS precedes DMN during social cognition.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However, the extent of [[feedforward]], [[feedback]], and [[Recurrence|recurrent]]{{dn|date=November 2018}} processing within and between MNS and DMN is not yet well-characterized, thus it is difficult to fully dissociate the exact functions of the two networks and their nodes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 

=== Mirror Neuron System (MNS) ===

[[Mirror neuron]]s, first discovered in [[macaque]] frontoparietal cortex, fire when actions are either performed or observed.&lt;ref name=Rizzolatti2004&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rizzolatti |first1=G |last2=Craighero |first2=L |title=The mirror-neuron system. |journal=Annual Review of Neuroscience |date=2004 |volume=27 |pages=169–92 |doi=10.1146/annurev.neuro.27.070203.144230 |pmid=15217330}} {{update-inline|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In humans, similar sensorimotor "mirroring" responses have been found in the brain regions listed below, which are collectively referred to as MNS.&lt;ref name=Rizzolatti2004/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rizzolatti2008" /&gt; The MNS is has been found to identify and represent intentional actions such as [[Facial expression|facial expressions]], [[body language]], and [[Grasp|grasping]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rizzolatti2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rizzolatti|first1=G|last2=Fabbri-Destro|first2=M|date=April 2008|title=The mirror system and its role in social cognition.|journal=Current Opinion in Neurobiology|volume=18|issue=2|pages=179–84|doi=10.1016/j.conb.2008.08.001|pmid=18706501}} {{update-inline|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; MNS may encode the ''concept'' of an action, not just the sensory and motor information associated with an action. As such, MNS representations have been shown to be invariant of how an action is observed (e.g. sensory modality) and how an action is performed (e.g. left versus right hand, upwards or downwards).&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2013-07-01|title=Crossmodal and action-specific: neuroimaging the human mirror neuron system|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|language=en|volume=17|issue=7|pages=311–318|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2013.04.012|pmid=23746574|issn=1364-6613|last1=Oosterhof|first1=Nikolaas N.|last2=Tipper|first2=Steven P.|last3=Downing|first3=Paul E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaplan|first=Jonas T.|last2=Man|first2=Kingson|last3=Greening|first3=Steven G.|date=2015|title=Multivariate cross-classification: applying machine learning techniques to characterize abstraction in neural representations|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|language=English|volume=9|pages=151|doi=10.3389/fnhum.2015.00151|pmid=25859202|pmc=4373279|issn=1662-5161}}&lt;/ref&gt; MNS has even been found to represent actions that are described in written language.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2013-09-01|title=How neurons make meaning: brain mechanisms for embodied and abstract-symbolic semantics|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|language=en|volume=17|issue=9|pages=458–470|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2013.06.004|pmid=23932069|issn=1364-6613|last1=Pulvermüller|first1=Friedemann}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mechanistic theories of MNS functioning fall broadly into two camps: motor and cognitive theories. Classical motor theories claim that abstract action representations arise from simulating actions within the motor system, while newer cognitive theories propose that abstract action representations arise from the integration of multiple domains of information: [[Perception|perceptual]], [[Motor system|motor]], [[Semantics|semantic]], and [[conceptual]].&lt;ref name="Lingnau2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lingnau|first1=A|last2=Downing|first2=PE|date=May 2015|title=The lateral occipitotemporal cortex in action.|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=19|issue=5|pages=268–77|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2015.03.006|pmid=25843544}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Aside from these competing theories, there are more fundamental controversies surrounding the human MNS – even the very existence of mirror neurons in this network is debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caramazza|first=Alfonso|last2=Anzellotti|first2=Stefano|last3=Strnad|first3=Lukas|last4=Lingnau|first4=Angelika|date=2014-07-08|title=Embodied Cognition and Mirror Neurons: A Critical Assessment|journal=Annual Review of Neuroscience|language=en|volume=37|issue=1|pages=1–15|doi=10.1146/annurev-neuro-071013-013950|pmid=25032490|issn=0147-006X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hickok2009" /&gt; As such, the term "MNS" is sometimes eschewed for more functionally-defined names such as "action observation network", "action identification network", and "action representation network".&lt;ref name="Hickok2009"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hickok|first=Gregory|date=July 2009|title=Eight Problems for the Mirror Neuron Theory of Action Understanding in Monkeys and Humans|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|language=EN|volume=21|issue=7|pages=1229–1243|doi=10.1162/jocn.2009.21189|pmc=2773693|pmid=19199415}} {{update-inline|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Premotor Cortex ====

The [[macaque]] [[premotor cortex]] was the location of the first discoveries of mirror neurons.&lt;ref name="Rizzolatti2004" /&gt; The premotor cortex is associated with a diverse array of functions, encompassing low-level motor control, motor planning, sensory guidance of movement, along with higher level cognitive functions such as [[Language processing in the brain|language processing]] and action comprehension.&lt;ref name="Graziano2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Graziano|first1=MS|last2=Aflalo|first2=TN|date=25 October 2007|title=Mapping behavioral repertoire onto the cortex.|journal=Neuron|volume=56|issue=2|pages=239–51|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2007.09.013|pmid=17964243}} {{open access}} {{update-inline|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The premotor cortex has been found to contain subregions with unique [[Cytoarchitecture|cytoarchitectural]] properties, the significance of which is not yet fully understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Graziano|first1=Michael S.A.|date=2016-02-01|title=Ethological Action Maps: A Paradigm Shift for the Motor Cortex|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|language=en|volume=20|issue=2|pages=121–132|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2015.10.008|issn=1364-6613|pmid=26628112}}&lt;/ref&gt; In humans, sensorimotor mirroring responses are also found throughout premotor cortex and adjacent sections of [[inferior frontal gyrus]] and [[supplementary motor area]]&lt;ref name="Rizzolatti2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rizzolatti2008" /&gt;

Visuospatial information is more prevalent in ventral premotor cortex than dorsal premotor cortex.&lt;ref name="Graziano2007" /&gt; In humans, sensorimotor mirroring responses extend beyond ventral premotor cortex into adjacent regions of inferior frontal gyrus, including [[Broca's area]], an area that is critical to language processing and speech production.&lt;ref name="Nishitani2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nishitani|first1=N|last2=Schürmann|first2=M|last3=Amunts|first3=K|last4=Hari|first4=R|date=February 2005|title=Broca's region: from action to language.|journal=Physiology (Bethesda, Md.)|volume=20|pages=60–9|doi=10.1152/physiol.00043.2004|pmid=15653841}} {{open access}} {{update-inline|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Action representations in inferior frontal gyrus can be evoked by language, such as action verbs, in addition to observed and performed action stimuli typically used in biological motion studies&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. The overlap between language and action understanding processes in inferior frontal gyrus has spurred some researchers to suggest overlapping neurocomputational mechanisms between the two.&lt;ref name="Nishitani2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Dorsal premotor cortex is strongly associated with motor preparation and guidance, such as representing multiple motor choices and deciding the final selection of action.&lt;ref name="Graziano2007" /&gt;

==== Intraparietal Sulcus ====
Classical studies of action observation have found mirror neurons in macaque [[intraparietal sulcus]].&lt;ref name="Rizzolatti2004" /&gt; In humans, sensorimotor mirroring responses are centered around the anterior intraperietal sulcus, with responses also seen in adjacent regions such as [[inferior parietal lobule]] and [[superior parietal lobule]]. Intraparietal sulcus appears to be most sensitive to the motor features (relative to perceptual and semantic features) of biological motion.&lt;ref name="Rizzolatti2008" /&gt; Intraparietal sulcus is considered a part of the [[two streams hypothesis|dorsal visual stream]], but is also thought to receive inputs from upstream non-dorsal stream areas such as LOTC and posterior superior temporal sulcus.&lt;ref name="Rizzolatti2008" /&gt;

==== Lateral Occipitotemporal Cortex (LOTC) ====
LOTC encompasses lateral regions of the [[visual cortex]] such as area [[Visual cortex#Middle temporal visual area (V5)|V5]]. Though LOTC is typically associated with visual processing, sensorimotor mirroring responses and abstract action representations are reliably found in this region.&lt;ref name="Lingnau2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Downing2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Downing|first1=PE|last2=Peelen|first2=MV|date=2011|title=The role of occipitotemporal body-selective regions in person perception.|journal=Cognitive Neuroscience|volume=2|issue=3–4|pages=186–203|doi=10.1080/17588928.2011.582945|pmid=24168534}}&lt;/ref&gt; LOTC includes cortical areas that are sensitive to motion, objects, body parts, kinematics, body postures, observed movements, and semantic content in verbs.&lt;ref name=Lingnau2015/&gt;&lt;ref name="Downing2011" /&gt; LOTC is thought to encode the fine sensorimotor details of an observed action (e.g. local kinematic and perceptual features).&lt;ref name=Downing2011/&gt; LOTC is also thought to bind together the different means by which a specific action can be carried out.&lt;ref name=Lingnau2015/&gt;

=== Default Mode Network (DMN) ===
{{See also|Theory_of_mind#Brain_mechanisms|}} The [[default mode network]] (DMN) is thought to process and represent abstract social information, such as mental states, traits, and intentions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Amft|first=Maren|last2=Bzdok|first2=Danilo|last3=Laird|first3=Angela R.|last4=Fox|first4=Peter T.|last5=Schilbach|first5=Leonhard|last6=Eickhoff|first6=Simon B.|date=2014-01-08|title=Definition and characterization of an extended social-affective default network|journal=Brain Structure and Function|language=en|volume=220|issue=2|pages=1031–1049|doi=10.1007/s00429-013-0698-0|issn=1863-2653|pmc=4087104|pmid=24399179}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2009-11-15|title=Understanding others' actions and goals by mirror and mentalizing systems: A meta-analysis|journal=NeuroImage|language=en|volume=48|issue=3|pages=564–584|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.06.009|pmid=19524046|issn=1053-8119|last1=Van Overwalle|first1=Frank|last2=Baetens|first2=Kris}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social cognitive functions such as [[theory of mind]], [[Mentalization|mentalizing]], [[emotion]] recognition, [[empathy]], [[Morality|moral]] cognition, and social [[working memory]] consistently recruit DMN regions in human neuroimaging studies.

==== Medial Prefrontal Cortex (mPFC) ====
{{See also|Dorsomedial prefrontal cortex|Ventromedial prefrontal cortex|Orbitofrontal cortex|}}
[[Medial prefrontal cortex]] (mPFC) is strongly associated with abstract social cognition such as mentalizing and theory of mind.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Denny|first=Bryan T.|last2=Kober|first2=Hedy|last3=Wager|first3=Tor D.|last4=Ochsner|first4=Kevin N.|date=August 2012|title=A Meta-analysis of Functional Neuroimaging Studies of Self- and Other Judgments Reveals a Spatial Gradient for Mentalizing in Medial Prefrontal Cortex|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|language=en|volume=24|issue=8|pages=1742–1752|doi=10.1162/jocn_a_00233|issn=0898-929X|pmc=3806720|pmid=22452556}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Theoryofmind2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Mentalizing about others activates much of the mPFC, but dorsal mPFC appears to be more selective for information about other people, while the middle mPFC may be more selective for information about the self.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

Ventral regions of mPFC, such as ventromedial prefrontal cortex and medial orbitofrontal cortex, are thought to play a critical role in the affective components of social cognition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7795">'''Sporogenesis''' is the production of [[spore]]s in [[biology]]. The term is also used to refer to the process of [[reproduction]] via spores. Reproductive spores were found to be formed in [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] organisms, such as [[plant]]s, [[algae]] and [[Fungus|fungi]], during their normal reproductive [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]]. Dormant spores are formed, for example by certain fungi and algae, primarily in response to unfavorable growing conditions. Most eukaryotic spores are [[haploid]] and form through cell division, though some types are [[diploid]] or [[dikaryon]]s and form through cell fusion.

== Reproduction via spores ==
Reproductive spores are generally the result of cell division, most commonly [[meiosis]] (e.g. in plant [[sporophyte]]s). Sporic meiosis is needed to complete the sexual life cycle of the organisms using it.

In some cases, sporogenesis occurs via [[mitosis]] (e.g. in some fungi and algae). Mitotic sporogenesis is a form of [[asexual reproduction]]. Examples are the [[Conidium|conidial fungi]] ''[[Aspergillus]]'' and ''[[Penicillium]]'', for which mitospore formation appears to be the primary mode of reproduction. Other fungi, such as [[ascomycete]]s, utilize both mitotic and meiotic spores. The red alga ''[[Polysiphonia]]'' alternates between mitotic and meiotic sporogenesis and both processes are required to complete its complex reproductive life cycle.

In the case of dormant spores in eukaryotes, sporogenesis often occurs as a result of [[fertilization]] or [[karyogamy]] forming a diploid spore equivalent to a [[zygote]]. Therefore, zygospores are the result of [[sexual reproduction]].

Reproduction via spores involves the spreading of the spores by water or air. Algae and some fungi ([[chytrids]]) often use motile [[zoospore]]s that can swim to new locations before developing into sessile organisms. Airborne spores are obvious in fungi, for example when they are released from [[puffball]]s. Other fungi have more active spore dispersal mechanisms. For example, the fungus ''[[Pilobolus]]'' can shoot its sporangia towards light. Plant spores designed for [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]] are also referred to as [[Diaspore (botany)|diaspore]]s. Plant spores are most obvious in the reproduction of [[fern]]s and [[moss]]es. However, they also exist in [[flowering plant]]s where they develop hidden inside the flower. For example, the [[pollen grain]]s of flowering plants develop out of microspores produced in the [[anther]]s.

Reproductive spores grow into multicellular haploid individuals or [[sporeling]]s. In [[heterosporous]] organisms, two types of spores exist: microspores give rise to males and megaspores to females. In [[homosporous]] organisms, all spores look alike and grow into individuals carrying reproductive parts of both genders.

== Formation of reproductive spores ==
Sporogenesis occurs in reproductive structures termed [[Sporangium|sporangia]]. The process involves sporogenous cells (sporocytes, also called spore mother cells) undergoing cell division to give rise to spores.

In meiotic sporogenesis, a diploid spore mother cell within the sporangium undergoes meiosis, producing a tetrad of haploid spores. In organisms that are [[heterosporous]], two types of spores occur: Microsporangia produce [[male]] microspores, and megasporangia produce [[female]] megaspores. In megasporogenesis, often three of the four spores degenerate after meiosis, whereas in microsporogenesis all four microspores survive.

In [[gymnosperm]]s, such as [[conifer]]s, microspores are produced through meiosis from microsporocytes in [[Strobilus|microstrobili]] or male cones. In [[flowering plant]]s, microspores are produced in the [[anther]]s of flowers. Each anther contains four [[Pollen#The structure and formation of pollen|pollen sacs]], which contain the microsporocytes. After meiosis, each microspore undergoes mitotic cell division, giving rise to multicellular [[pollen grain]]s (six nuclei in gymnosperms, three nuclei in flowering plants).

Megasporogenesis occurs in [[Strobilus|megastrobili]] in conifers (for example a pine cone) and inside the [[ovule]] in the flowers of flowering plants. A megasporocyte inside a megasporangium or ovule undergoes meiosis, producing four megaspores. Only one is a functional megaspore whereas the others stay dysfunctional or degenerate. The megaspore undergoes several mitotic divisions to develop into a female [[gametophyte]] (for example the seven-cell/eight-nuclei [[embryo sac]] in flowering plants).

=== Mitospore formation ===
Some fungi and algae produce [[mitospore]]s through mitotic cell division within a sporangium. In fungi, such mitospores are referred to as [[conidia]].

== Formation of dormant spores ==
Some algae, and fungi form [[resting spore]]s made to survive unfavorable conditions. Typically, changes in the environment from favorable to unfavorable growing conditions will trigger a switch from [[asexual reproduction]] to [[sexual reproduction]] in these organisms. The resulting spores are protected through the formation of a thick [[cell wall]] and can withstand harsh conditions such as drought or extreme temperatures. Examples are [[chlamydospore]]s, [[teliospore]]s, [[zygospore]]s, and [[Myxococcus xanthus|myxospores]]. Similar survival structures produced in some [[bacteria]] are known as [[endospore]]s.
 
=== Chlamydospore and teliospore formation ===
[[Chlamydospore]]s are generally multicellular, asexual structures. [[Teliospore]]s are a form of chlamydospore produced through the fusion of cells or [[hyphae]] where the [[Cell nucleus|nuclei]] of the fused cells stay separate. These nuclei undergo [[karyogamy]] and meiosis upon germination of the spore.

=== Zygospore, oospore and auxospore formation ===
[[Zygospore]]s are formed in certain fungi ([[zygomycota]], for example ''[[Rhizopus]]'') and some algae (for example ''[[Chlamydomonas]]''). The zygospore forms through the [[Isogamy|isogamic]] fusion of two cells (motile single cells in ''Chlamydomonas'') or sexual [[Sexual conjugation|conjugation]] between two hyphae (in zygomycota). [[Plasmogamy]] is followed by [[karyogamy]], therefore zygospores are diploid ([[zygote]]s). They will undergo zygotic meiosis upon germinating.

In [[oomycete]]s, the zygote forms through the fertilization of an egg cell with a sperm nucleus and enters a resting stage as a diploid, thick-walled [[oospore]]. The germinating oospore undergoes mitosis and gives rise to diploid hyphae which reproduce asexually via mitotic zoospores as long as conditions are favorable.

In [[diatom]]s, fertilization gives rise to a zygote termed [[auxospore]]. Besides sexual reproduction and as a resting stage, the function of an auxospore is the restoration of the original cell size, as diatoms get progressively smaller during mitotic cell division. Auxospores divide by mitosis.

=== Endospore formation ===
The term sporogenesis can also refer to [[endospore]] formation in [[bacteria]], which allows the cells to survive unfavorable conditions. Endospores are not reproductive structures and their formation does not require cell fusion or division. Instead, they form through the production of an encapsulating spore coat within the spore-forming cell.

== Parts of the spore ==
There are many parts of the spore 'plant'. The case that holds all the spores is called a sporangium.

The work was commissioned by the [[Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra]] and is dedicated to the composer's brother, who suffered from a debilitating [[stroke]] in 2008.  It was first performed in [[Pittsburgh]] on May 13, 2011, by the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra under the conductor [[Manfred Honeck]].&lt;ref name="Score"&gt;{{cite web |last=Tower |first=Joan |authorlink=Joan Tower |year=2010 |title=Stroke |publisher=[[G.

==Composition==
''Stroke'' has a duration of roughly 17 minutes and is composed in one continuous [[Movement (music)|movement]].  Tower dedicated the piece to her younger brother George, who suffered from a stroke in 2008 at the age of 60 that left his body paralyzed on his entire left side.  She wrote in the score program notes:{{quote|The horrific journey of the aftermath of a serious stroke consists of many different emotional stages: crying, anger, anxiety and depression. The huge adjustment of the mind and the DNA of the body requires a strong resilience of emotion and a large amount of mental discipline to adapt to a body that can no longer do the things it did before. The positive side of this experience (and alternate meaning of the word "stroke") is one of occasional but welcomed rests of peace and deep love that become more pronounced as the stroke victim adjusts to his new reality.

I tried to depict these extreme emotions through the musical journey of my 17-minute piece. Inside a dramatic and often loud steady beat (of the heart) surrounded by waves of fast notes (which veer between "anxious" and "joyful"), there are five slower (and "softer") solos for horn, bassoon, violin, clarinet and trumpet where more "peaceful" surroundings come forward.&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt;}}
Tower concluded, "''Stroke'' is a piece concerned with many emotions, one that hopefully offers a quiet "hope" at the end. With a stroke, it is hard to tell which way it will go."&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt;

===Instrumentation===
The work is scored for an orchestra comprising three[[Western concert flute|flutes]] (doubling [[piccolo]]), two [[oboe]]s, three [[clarinet]]s, two [[bassoon]]s, four [[French horn|horns]], three [[trumpet]]s, three [[trombone]]s (doubling [[bass trombone]]), [[tuba]], [[timpani]], three percussionists, [[piano]], and [[String section|strings]].&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt;

==Reception==
Reviewing a recording of ''Stroke'', the music critic Leslie Wright called it "a very well constructed piece that grips one throughout its nearly 20-minute length."  He added, "I am quite impressed with this work and think it deserves a place on any contemporary programme, especially if it were performed as well as it is here."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wright |first=Leslie |title=REVIEW: Tower Violin Concerto |work=Musicweb-International |url=http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2015/Aug/Tower_VC_8559775.htm |accessdate=January 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recording==
The [[Nashville Symphony]] launched a [[Kickstarter]] campaign on August 23, 2013 to raise $15,500 for a recording of ''Stroke'', in addition to Tower's ''Chamber Dance'' and her [[Violin Concerto (Tower)|Violin Concerto]], to commemorate the composer's 75th birthday.

{{Subud}}

'''Subud''' (pronounced {{IPA-may|ˈsʊbʊd|}}) is an international [[spirituality|spiritual]] movement that began in [[Indonesia]] in the 1920s, founded by [[Muhammad Subuh Sumohadiwidjojo]].{{refn|group=note|The name Subud was first used in the 1940s when Subud was legally registered in Indonesia.}} The basis of Subud is a spiritual exercise called the [[Latihan|''latihan kejiwaan'']], which was said by Muhammad Subuh to represent guidance from "the Power of God" or "the Great Life Force". He claimed that Subud was not a new teaching or religion, and recommended that Subud members practice an established religion; he left the choice of religion up to the individual. Some members have converted to Islam; others have found that their faith in and practice of Christianity or Judaism, for example, has deepened after practising the latihan.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Barry Sullivan. ''Living Religion in Subud''. 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; There are Subud groups in about 83 countries, with a worldwide membership of about 10,000.&lt;ref name=Hunt122&gt;Hunt (2003), p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name "Subud" is an acronym that stands for three [[Javanese language|Javanese]] words, [[Susila Budhi Dharma]], which are derived from the [[Sanskrit]] terms suśīla (good-tempered), [[bodhi]] and [[dharma]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.subud.org.uk/about-subud.html "About Subud"]. Subud Britain.&lt;/ref&gt;

The meaning depends on the context in which they are being used.  The original Sanskrit root words are defined differently than Pak Subuh indicates:

;Sanskrit
* ''Suśīla'': "well-disposed", "having an amiable disposition", "good-tempered".&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=+suzila&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU Sanskrit Dictionary, "Suzila"]. ''Spokensanskrit.de''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Bodhi]]'': ([[Buddhahood]]) is the understanding possessed by a Buddha regarding [[dharma|the nature of things]]. It is traditionally translated into English as "[[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]]" and literally means "awakened." ''Bodhi'' is knowledge of [[Pratītyasamutpāda|the causal mechanism]] by which beings [[incarnation|incarnate]] into material form and experience [[dukkha|suffering]]. Although its most common usage is in the context of [[Buddhism]], bodhi is [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|also present]] as a concept in other Indian philosophies and traditions.
* [[Dharma]]: the Law that "upholds, supports or maintains [[Ṛta|the regulatory order of the universe]]".

;Pak Subuh
Pak Subuh gives the following definitions:{{sfn|Pak Subuh (1966)}}
* Susila: the good character of man in accordance with the Will of Almighty God
* Budhi: the force of the inner self within man
* Dharma: surrender, trust and sincerity towards Almighty God

==History==
[[File:Muhammad Subuh Sumohadiwidjojo.jpg|thumb|right|Bapak Muhammad Subuh Sumohadiwidjojo]]
[[Muhammad Subuh Sumohadiwidjojo]] explained in talks to Subud members, beginning in the 1940s, that during 1925 he was taking a late-night walk when he had an unexpected and unusual experience. He said he found himself enveloped in a brilliant light, and looked up to see what seemed like the sun falling directly onto his body, and he thought that he was having a heart attack. He said he went directly home, lay down on his bed, and prepared to die with the feeling that maybe it was his time, and that he could not fight it, so he surrendered himself to God.

According to the story, however, instead of dying he was moved from within to stand up and perform movements similar to his normal Muslim prayer routine. It seemed that he was not moving through his own volition; but was being guided by what he interpreted as the power of God. This same kind of experience reportedly happened to him for a few hours each night over a period of about 1000 days during which he slept little but was able to continue working full-time. He said he experienced a kind of "inner teaching" whereby he was given to understand a variety of things spontaneously.

As these experiences proceeded, Pak Subuh explained, he gained spontaneous insight into people and situations that he had not possessed before. Around 1933, as he reported, he received that if other people were physically near him while he was in a state of "latihan", then the experience would begin in them also. While still in his early thirties, Pak Subuh's reputation as someone with spiritual insight apparently grew, and people went to him to be 'opened'. They in turn could open others, and this is how Subud eventually spread around the world.
[[File:rofe3.jpg|thumb|left|Husein Rofé in 1955 in Hong Kong]]
In Jakarta, Husein Rofé, an English linguist who had been living in Indonesia since 1950, met Pak Subuh. Rofé had been searching for a spiritual path and became the first non-Indonesian to be opened.
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:JGBennet.jpg|thumb|right|J.G.Bennett in the Netherlands in 1963]] --&gt;
Subud moved outside of Indonesia when Rofé attended a religious congress in Japan in 1954. Subud first spread internationally into Japan, followed by Hong Kong and Cyprus. In 1957, Rofé (who was then in London) suggested that Pak Subuh visit Britain. Pak Subuh accepted the invitation and visited the home of [[John G. Bennett]] in Coombe Springs. It was at this time that many UK followers of [[George Gurdjieff]] were initiated into Subud, including Bennett himself, though he later left the group. Over the next 14 months Pak Subuh visited many countries before returning to Indonesia.

==Symbol==
[[File:SubudSymbol.svg|thumb|right|"Seven Circles" symbol of Subud]]
The Subud symbol was envisioned by Pak Subuh in 1959. The design consists of seven concentric circles and seven spokes, which, in traditional Javanese mysticism, represent seven levels of life forces as well as the Great Life Force that connects them. Each circle grows wider, the further out from the center, and each spoke narrows as it approaches the center. The space between the circles remains constant.

The symbol is often printed in black and white when color printing is not available. When colors are used, usually the circles and spokes are gold and the background is dark blue to black. However, the symbol is also sometimes blue on white or white on blue. The World Subud Association has registered this design, as well as the name "Subud", as a trade, service or collective membership mark in many countries.

==Practices==
{{Main|Latihan}}
The core of Subud is the ''latihan'' experience. Pak Subuh gives the following descriptions of ''Subud'':{{sfn|Pak Subuh (1966)}}
{{quote|This is the symbol of a person who has a calm and peaceful inner feeling and who is able to receive the contact with the Great Holy Life Force. As the spiritual training (''latihan kedjiwaan'') of Subud is free from the influence of the passions, desires and thinking, and is truly awakened by the Power of Almighty God, the aim of Subud is naturally toward perfection of character according to the Will of the One Who awakens it, namely: Almighty God. It is also necessary to explain that Subud is neither a kind of religion nor a teaching, but is a spiritual experience awakened by the Power of God leading to spiritual reality free from the influence of the passions, desires and thinking.}}

The central practice of Subud is the ''latihan kejiwaan'' (literally "spiritual exercise" or "training of the spirit"&lt;ref&gt;Chryssides (1999), p. 261&lt;/ref&gt;) or simply "the latihan". This exercise is not thought about, learned or trained for; it is unique for each person and the ability to "receive" it is passed on by being in the presence of another practicing member at the "opening" (see below).  About twice a week, Subud members go to a local center to participate in a group latihan, men and women separately.&lt;ref&gt;Webb (1995), pp. 269–270&lt;/ref&gt;  The experience takes place in a room or a hall with open space. After a period of sitting quietly, the members are typically asked to stand and relax by a "helper" (see below), who then announces the start of the exercise.&lt;ref name=Chryssides263&gt;Chryssides (1999), p. 263&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Webb270&gt;Webb (1995), p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;

In the practice of the exercise, members are typically advised to follow "what arises from within", not expecting anything in advance. One is recommended not to focus on any image or recite any mantra, nor to mix the exercise with other activities like meditation or use of drugs, but simply to intend to surrender to the Divine or the transcendent good or the will of God. (The term "God" is used here with a broad and inclusive intention. An individual is at liberty to substitute interpretations that they feel more in tune with.) One is not to pay attention to others in the room, each of whom is doing his or her own latihan.&lt;ref name=Webb270/&gt; During the exercise, practitioners may find that, in terms of physical and emotional expression, they involuntarily move, make sounds, walk around, dance, jump, skip, laugh, cry or whatever.&lt;ref name=Hunt122/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chryssides263/&gt; The experience varies greatly for different people, but the practitioner is always wholly conscious throughout and free to stop the exercise at any time.

Many Subud members believe that this experience, apparently arising from within each person, provides them with something of what they currently need in life. For some, the latihan may appear to initially involve a "purification", which possibly permits subsequently deeper experience. Members may describe their latihan as leaving them feeling "cleansed", "centered", "at peace", or "energized".&lt;ref name=Webb270/&gt; The latihan is sometimes said to "work" 24 hours a day, not only when one is explicitly "doing" it.&lt;ref&gt;Chryssides (1999), p. 269&lt;/ref&gt; Supposedly, the regular practice of the latihan will enable people to experience positive development in various aspects of their daily life and being. The official website talks of "a deepening of the natural connection with wisdom, one's higher self, the divine, or God, depending on one's preferred terminology". (see links)

Although the latihan can be practised alone, members are advised to participate regularly, ideally twice a week, in a group latihan. When a member has enough experience to reliably sense the appropriate time to finish his or her latihan session, he or she may add perhaps one more weekly session of the latihan at home.

While the suggestions of Subud's founder are held as valuable by many members, there is no requirement to believe anything, and the latihan is open to individuals of all faiths - or none. Subud officially endorses no doctrine regarding the latihan's nature or benefits.

===The Opening===
The "opening" refers to a person's first latihan, which is specially arranged to pass on the "contact", metaphorically resembling a candle flame that lights a new candle with no difference in quality of the flame. Only after the formal opening process, in most cases, is a person able to receive for himself or herself, and is then welcome to participate in the group latihan. In the opening, the person is accompanied by one or more experienced members called "helpers", and is asked to simply stand and relax with the helpers standing nearby. A simple statement or agreed set of "opening words" is read by one of the helpers that acknowledges the person's wish to receive the contact. The helpers then begin the exercise as they would normally do. The contact is passed on to the new member without effort or intention on the part of anyone present. This is the moment of the person's first connection with the latihan kejiwaan of Subud.

===Testing===
Testing is a distinct variety of the latihan directed toward receiving guidance or insight on a particular issue. Some question or request for clarification is acknowledged, and then the exercise is performed with openness to the issue. The original word for testing used by Muhammad Subuh was "terimah," which is Indonesian for "receiving". Many people who have been practicing the latihan for some time claim to be able to recognize indications or intuitions "from their inner feeling" in response to questions that are put forward.

Such indications may take various forms, including sounds, visions, vibrations and/or spontaneous physical movements similar to, though perhaps more intense than, those experienced in the usual latihan. However, it appears that such indications often defy intellectual analysis and that the supposed guidance can be obscured or biased by the mental or emotional attitudes of those present. Testing is generally viewed as an instrument for helping to clarify issues in the present, but may lead to confusion if treated as a kind of fortune-telling. Nevertheless, many Subud members claim to benefit from testing in terms of resolving issues.

Testing is normally used to help select helpers, and often committee members, throughout the World Subud Association. Pak Subuh's book "[[Susila Budhi Dharma]]" cites examples of situations in which testing may be useful, including self-training in putting any benefits of the latihan into practice. (Throughout Muhammad Subuh's book "[[Susila Budhi Dharma]]", which was written in 1952, testing is always referred to as "feeling" or "receiving". The first time "testing" was called by that name was in 1957 by [[John G. Bennett]].)

===Fasting===
Individual Subud members often voluntarily engage in occasional fasting as Pak Subuh recommended. Each year, some members fast at the same time as the Muslim fast of [[Ramadan]] which Pak Subuh, himself a Muslim, claimed to be suitable for non-Muslims. Others fast during [[Lent]] or simply on a regular, private basis. In this context, fasting is regarded by many Subud members as spiritually edifying, although its practice is not expected.

===Rules===
Pak Subuh provided advice and guidance in his talks to provide direction to members as their latihan deepens. Although in general there are no rules in the practice of the latihan, non-members may not attend the latihan exercise without first receiving the contact referred to above, known as their opening.

Subud's founder wanted the latihan to be accessible to people of all cultures, faiths and ethnicities. Respect for the diversity of personal backgrounds and the uniqueness of each individual, along with a general absence of "thou shalt nots", are aspects of the organization that have been attractive to many members.

==Association==
Members who wish to take on organizational responsibility in Subud can volunteer as a committee member or as a helper. Each responsibility can be performed at the local, regional, national, and international levels. Members often move from one responsibility to another, as needed.

The broadest organizational responsibility rests with the [[World Subud Association]], which organizes a World Congress every four years and consists of the Subud World Council, Subud representatives from each country, and individual members who wish to participate, although only representatives can vote. The headquarters of the international organization moves to a different country every four years.

===Helpers===
{{Main|Helper (Subud)}}

Each level of the association has members called "helpers" whose role is to coordinate the timing of group latihan, witness the opening of new members, speak to those interested in the latihan, be available to discuss problems relating to the latihan, and sometimes attend to the latihan needs of isolated or indisposed Subud members. Helpers are usually selected from members who are willing to perform the duties, and selection generally occurs through testing. In no way does selection mean that a person is more spiritually advanced than a member who is not a helper.

Helpers exist at the local, regional (in some countries), national and international levels. Helpers' geographical status relates to the regional or national supportive duties they are expected to provide – otherwise, there are no geographical restrictions on where a helper is considered to be a helper. A local helper from London who travels to Jakarta, for example, will be seen as a helper there, and can do testing or participate in a new member's opening in the same way as any Indonesian helper.

There are normally 18 international helpers—nine men and nine women. Three men and three women are assigned to each of the three areas in Subud:

# Area I covers Zones 1 &amp; 2 (Australasia and Asia)
# Area II covers Zones 3, 4, 5, and 6 (Europe and Africa)
# Area III covers Zones 7, 8 &amp; 9 (the Americas)

The international helpers are members of the World Subud Council. They serve on a voluntary basis for a four-year term, which runs from World Congress to World Congress. There is no distinction in rank between local, national, or international helpers. Nor is there a difference in status between helpers, committee or members. Being a helper is seen not as a talent but as a service role.

===Ibu Rahayu===
Ibu Siti Rahayu Wiryohudoyo is Pak Subuh's eldest daughter. In a talk given on 5 March 2010 to a National Gathering in Semarang, Indonesia, Ibu Siti Rahayu explains how she came to be appointed "spiritual advisor" by the Subud International Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Subud Canada (2010) SCAN The Quarterly Newsletter of Subud Canada, p. 13 [http://www.subud.ca/sites/default/files/SCAN_Autumn_2010.pdf SCAN Autumn 2010] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140906085307/http://www.subud.ca/sites/default/files/SCAN_Autumn_2010.pdf |date=6 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Committees===
Most Subud groups have a committee, typically including a chairperson, vice-chair, treasurer and secretary. This committee is responsible for making sure there is a place to do group latihan, communications, budgets, and supporting the mutual efforts of members at the local group. A similar structure functions at the regional (in certain countries), national, zonal and international levels.

The international executive is the International Subud Committee (ISC). Apart from ensuring communication, publishing, budgeting, archives and support of affiliates, it organizes a World Congress every four years. The ISC chairperson sits on the World Subud Council.

For purposes of a practical organizational structure, the Subud association is divided into nine multinational zones, more or less as follows:

:*Zones 1 &amp; 2 – Australasia and Asia
:*Zone 3 – includes 8 countries of western Europe
:*Zone 4 – central and eastern European countries
:*Zones 5 &amp; 6 – Francophone and Anglophone African countries, respectively
:*Zone 7 – USA, Canada, Mexico, Cuba, Jamaica, Surinam, and the Caribbean
:*Zone 8 – the upper part of South America
:*Zone 9 – the lower part of South America

Each Zone has its own four representatives that are the voting members on the World Subud Council. They also serve as volunteers a four-year term like helpers. They are selected at Zone Meetings.

The chairperson of the World Subud Association serves a four-year term from one World Congress to the next and is also the chairperson of the World Subud Council. The World Subud Council is responsible for ensuring that decisions made at World Congress are carried through.

===Affiliates===
Subud affiliates (sometimes called ‘wings’) are subsidiary organizations that focus on specific projects at a national or international level. They are technically independent organizations but have overlapping boards of trustees. They include:

:*[[Susila Dharma International Association]] (SDI or SDIA) – humanitarian projects
:*[[Subud International Cultural Association]] (SICA) – networking cultural activities
:*[[Subud Enterprise Services]] International (SES or SESI) – networks between entrepreneurial activities
:*[[Subud Youth Association]] (SYA) – networks among younger Subud members
:*Subud International Health Organisation (SIHA) – incorporates both scientific and alternative approaches

Some chairpersons of these affiliates also sit on the World Subud Council and serve a four-year term.

In addition to the above affiliates, a foundation – the [[Muhammad Subuh Foundation]] (MSF) – has been set up, whose main work is helping groups acquire their own latihan premises.

Informal networks and interest groups initiated by members include a Peace Network, a Spiritual Support Network (Yahoo group) and several Facebook groups.

===Enterprises===
When Subud first spread outside Indonesia, Pak Subuh talked mainly about the spiritual exercise. He started to encourage Subud members to engage in enterprises and donate a proportion of profits to welfare projects and to maintaining the Subud organisation. He explained that the fact of the latihan "bringing to life" the physical body indicates that worship need not be viewed as narrowly as prayer in places of worship; that people's ordinary lives, when following and guided by the Power of God, are ongoing worship, such that there is a dynamic interplay between "material" life and "spiritual" life. Therefore, his encouragement for Subud members to engage in enterprise is seen in the context of putting the latihan into practice.

===Membership===
Membership is open to any person over 17 years of age, irrespective of the person's religion or lack of religion. (As Pak Subuh saw it, the latihan is for "all of mankind.") The exception is that someone suffering from a serious mental illness may not be initiated as a member.

There is normally a waiting period of up to three months before a person may be opened. During this period, the enquirer is expected to meet a few times with the local helpers so that he or she can have questions answered and doubts clarified.

There is no membership fee, but most Subud members contribute, for example, to the rent or upkeep of premises where they meet.

{{About|the interdisciplinary field|the analysis of systems in electrical engineering|system analysis}}
The [[Merriam-Webster]] dictionary defines '''system analysis''' as "the process of studying a procedure or [[business]] in order to identify its goals and purposes and create [[system]]s and procedures that will achieve them in an efficient way". Another view sees system analysis as a [[problem-solving]] technique that breaks down a system into its component pieces for the purpose of the studying how well those component parts work and interact to accomplish their purpose.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Systems-Analysis-Design-Global-Enterprise/dp/0071107665 System Analysis and Design for the Global Enterprise] by Lonnie D. Bentley p.160 7th edition&lt;/ref&gt;

The field of system analysis relates closely to [[Requirement analysis|requirements analysis]] or to [[operations research]]. It is also "an explicit formal inquiry carried out to help a [[decision maker]] identify a better course of action and make a better decision than she might otherwise have made."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070822025602/http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/ASC/SYSTEM_ANALY.html SYSTEMS ANALYSIS]&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms [[wiktionary:analysis|analysis]] and [[wiktionary:synthesis|synthesis]] stem from Greek, meaning "to take apart" and "to put together," respectively. These terms are used in many [[scientific discipline]]s, from mathematics and logic to economics and psychology, to denote similar investigative procedures. Analysis is defined as "the procedure by which we break down an intellectual or substantial whole into parts," while synthesis means "the procedure by which we combine separate elements or components in order to form a coherent whole." &lt;ref&gt;Tom Ritchey, [http://www.swemorph.com/pdf/anaeng-r.pdf  Analysis and Synthesis.]&lt;/ref&gt; System analysis researchers apply [[methodology]] to the systems involved, forming an overall picture.

System analysis is used in every field where something is developed. Analysis can also be a series of components that perform organic functions together, such as system engineering. [[System engineering]] is an [[interdisciplinary field]] of engineering that focuses on how complex engineering projects should be designed and managed.

==Information technology==
The development of a computer-based information system includes a system analysis phase. This helps produce the [[data model]], a precursor to creating or enhancing a [[database]]. There are a number of different approaches to system analysis. When a computer-based information system is developed, system analysis (according to the [[Waterfall model]]) would constitute the following steps:

* The development of a feasibility study: determining whether a project is economically, socially, technologically and organizationally feasible
* Fact-finding measures, designed to ascertain the requirements of the system's end-users (typically involving interviews, questionnaires, or visual observations of work on the existing system)
* Gauging how the end-users would operate the system (in terms of general experience in using computer hardware or software), what the system would be used for and so on

Another view outlines a phased approach to the process. This  approach breaks system analysis into 5 phases:

* Scope Definition: Clearly defined objectives and requirements necessary to meet a project's requirements as defined by its stakeholders
* Problem analysis: the process of understanding problems and needs and arriving at solutions that meet them
* Requirements analysis: determining the conditions that need to be met
* Logical design: looking at the logical relationship among the objects
* Decision analysis: making a final decision
 
[[Use case]]s are widely used system analysis modeling tools for identifying and expressing the functional requirements of a system. Each use case is a business scenario or event for which the system must provide a defined response. Use cases evolved from object-oriented analysis.

==Policy analysis==
The discipline of what is today known as [[policy analysis]] originated from the application of system analysis when it was first instituted by United States [[Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara]].{{cn|date=April 2016}}

==Practitioners==
Practitioners of system analysis are often called up to dissect systems that have grown haphazardly to determine the current components of the system. This was shown during the year 2000 re-engineering effort as business and manufacturing processes were examined as part of the [[Y2K]] automation upgrades.&lt;ref&gt;Géza HUSI: Mechatronics Control Systems&lt;/ref&gt; Employment utilizing system analysis include [[system analyst]], [[business analyst]], [[Industrial engineering|manufacturing engineer]], [[system architect]], [[enterprise architect]], [[software architect]], etc.

While practitioners of system analysis can be called upon to create new systems, they often modify, expand or document existing systems ([[Process (engineering)|processes]], [[Procedure (term)|procedures]] and [[Methodology|methods]]). Researchers and practitioners rely on system analysis. Activity system analysis has been already applied to various research and practice studies including business management, educational reform, educational technology, etc.

'''Tactoids''' are [[liquid crystal]] [[wiktionary:microdomain|microdomains]] nucleated in [[isotropic]] phases, which can be distinguished as spherical or spindle-shaped [[birefringence|birefringent]] microdroplets under [[polarized light microscopy]]. Tactoids are a transition state between [[isotropic]] and [[macroscopic]] liquid crystalline phases. The first observation of tactoids was made by Zocher in 1925, when he studied the [[nematic]] phase formed in [[vanadium pentoxide]] [[sol (colloid)|sol]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Über freiwillige Strukturbildung in Solen.

'''Tonya Maxene Price''' (née '''Harding'''; born November 12, 1970) is a retired American [[figure skating|figure skater]].

A native of [[Portland, Oregon]], Harding was raised primarily by her mother, who enrolled her in ice skating lessons beginning at age four. Harding would spend much of her early life training, eventually dropping out of high school to devote her time to the sport. After climbing the ranks in the [[U.S. Figure Skating Championships]] between 1986 and 1989, Harding won the 1989 [[Skate America]] competition. She was the 1991 and 1994 U.S. champion before being stripped of her 1994 title, and 1991 [[1991 World Figure Skating Championships|World silver medalist]]. In 1991, she earned distinction as being the first American woman to successfully land a triple [[Axel jump|Axel]] in competition, and the second woman to do so in history (behind [[Midori Ito]]). She is also a two-time Olympian and a two-time Skate America Champion.

In January 1994, Harding became embroiled in controversy when her ex-husband, Jeff Gillooly, orchestrated an attack on fellow US Olympian [[Nancy Kerrigan]]. After the [[1994 Winter Olympics]], Harding ultimately pleaded guilty to hindering the prosecution on March 16 and was banned for life on June 30, 1994 from the [[U.S. Figure Skating Association]].

In the early 2000s, Harding competed as a [[professional boxer]], and her life has been the subject of numerous films, documentaries, books, and academic studies. In 2014, two [[Television documentary|documentary television films]] about Harding's life and skating career (''Nancy &amp; Tonya'' and ''The Price of Gold'') were aired within two months of each other — inspiring [[Steven Rogers (screenwriter)|Steven Rogers]] to write the [[Black comedy|darkly comedic]] [[biographical film]] ''[[I, Tonya]]'', released in 2017 and starring [[Margot Robbie]] as Harding. In 2018, she was a contestant on [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 26)|season 26]] of ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]'', finishing in third place.

== Early life ==
[[File:Ice chalet lloyd center portland oregon lec by andrew parodi.jpeg|thumb|Right|Ice Chalet at Portland's [[Lloyd Center]], where Harding began skating at age four]]

Tonya Maxene Harding was born on November 12, 1970, in Portland, Oregon, to LaVona Golden and Albert Gordon Harding (1933–2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.tillamookheadlightherald.com/obituaries/albert-gordon-harding/article_fbf7f286-1e22-5e3d-8d4b-3c27f9952c35.html |title=Albert Gordon Harding |newspaper=Headlight-Herald|date=2009-04-14| accessdate=2018-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was raised in [[East Portland, Oregon|East Portland]], and began skating at age three, training with coach Diane Rawlinson. During her youth, Harding also hunted, drag raced, and learned automotive mechanics from her father. LaVona struggled to support the family while working as a waitress, and hand-sewed her daughter's skating costumes as they could not afford to purchase them. Harding's parents divorced after 19 years of marriage in 1987, when she was 16 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=dpNODgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=They%20divorced%20in%201987|url-access=subscription|last1=Prouse|first1=Lynda D.|last2=Harding|first2=Tonya|title=The Tonya Tapes|year=2008|page=40|access-date=2018-08-03|quote=[My parents] divorced in 1987. They separated in February, and then their divorce was final sometime in the summer}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later dropped out of [[Milwaukie High School]] during her sophomore year in order to focus on skating, and earned a General Equivalency Diploma.{{sfn|Prouse|Harding|2008|pages=13; 44; 46; 65}}

According to Harding, she was frequently abused by her mother. She stated that by the time she was seven years old, both physical and psychological abuse had become a regular part of her life. LaVona admitted to one instance of hitting Harding at an ice rink.&lt;ref name="Oprah Sk Sc"&gt;{{cite web |website=Oprah.com |url=http://www.oprah.com/world/Tonya-Hardings-Figure-Skating-Scandal/5 |title=Tonya Harding's Skating Scandal |access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2018, Harding's childhood friend and filmmaker, Sandra Luckow, spoke in defence of Harding's mother because she felt that the 2017 film ''I, Tonya'' stretched some truths about LaVona's character. Luckow said that although Harding's mother could be "egregious" towards her daughter, LaVona actually funded and appreciated Harding's skating lessons – and had "a huge amount of humanity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://people.com/movies/tonya-harding-mother-monster-friend/|first=Ale|last=Russian|title=Was Tonya Harding's Mom Really a Monster?

In Harding's 2008 authorized biography, ''The Tonya Tapes'' (written by Lynda D. Prouse from recorded interviews she had with Harding), she revealed she was the victim of acquaintance rape in 1991&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=dpNODgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=I%20never%20told%20anybody%20because%20I%20knew%20the%20person|url-access=subscription|last1=Prouse|first1=Lynda D.|last2=Harding|first2=Tonya|title=The Tonya Tapes|year=2008|pages=125; 132|access-date=July 31, 2018|quote=I was separated from Jeff [at the] time in '91.

In 1986, Harding called the police after Davison had been sexually harassing and terrorizing her. He was arrested and spent a short time in prison. Harding claimed that her parents were in denial about Davison's behavior and told her not to press criminal charges against him. Davison was killed in a 1988 unsolved vehicular hit-and-run accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=dpNODgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=.And%20my%20mother%20and%20father%20came%20home%20and%20said%20I%20was|url-access=subscription|last1=Prouse|first1=Lynda D.|last2=Harding|first2=Tonya|title=The Tonya Tapes|year=2008|pages=57–62|access-date=July 30, 2018|quote=[The police] ended up arresting [Davison]...And my mother and father came home and said I was [lying about the harassment].}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Not Your Average Ice Queen"&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1992/01/13/125774/not-your-average-ice-queen-a-troubled-past-hasnt-stopped-tonya-harding-from-becoming-a-figure-skating-champion|title=Not Your Average Ice Queen|magazine=Sports Illustrated|date=Jan 13, 1992|accessdate=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 3, 1994, during an interview with [[Rolonda Watts]], Harding said that Chris Davison was the lone person in her life unworthy of forgiveness and "the only person I've ever hated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://variety.com/1994/tv/news/rolonda-first-talker-to-nab-tonya-interview-120020/|title='Rolonda' first talker to nab Tonya interview|last=Flint|first=Joe|magazine=Variety|date=April 8, 1994|accessdate=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95rjRhjESUg&amp;t=1012s Rolonda Watts' Interview with Tonya Harding].

== Skating career ==
Harding trained as a figure skater throughout her youth with coach Diane Rawlinson. In the mid-1980s, she began working her way up the competitive skating ladder. She placed sixth at the 1986 U.S. Figure Skating Championships, fifth in 1987 and 1988, and third in 1989. After competing in the February [[1989 U.S. Figure Skating Championships|1989 Nationals Championship]], Harding began training with Dody Teachman as her coach.&lt;ref name="Hersh"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-03-04/sports/9201200938_1_diane-rawlinson-dody-teachman-tonya-harding|title=Skater Changes Coaches, Again|first=Phil|last=Hersh|newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=March 4, 1992|accessdate=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=dpNODgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=snippet&amp;q=%22Who%20was%20your%20coach%22|url-access=subscription|last1=Prouse|first1=Lynda D.|last2=Harding|first2=Tonya|title=The Tonya Tapes|year=2008|page=26|access-date=2018-08-03|quote=Who was your coach...through your amateur years? *'Diane...then Dody Teachman was my other coach - when I came into my 18 year old teenage years thinking I knew everything...'*}}&lt;/ref&gt; She then won the October [[1989 Skate America]] competition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|layurl=https://www.statelib.lib.in.us/IndyNews/1848_1991_display.asp?ID=123488|title=Skate America, major international figure skating coming to Indianapolis in October 1989|page=12|via=www.StateLib.lib.In.us (Indiana State Library)|department=Indianapolis Newspapers Database, 1848-1991|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|date=Aug 20, 1989|postscript= : Section B, column 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was considered a strong contender at the February [[1990 U.S. Figure Skating Championships]]. However, she was suffering from the [[influenza|flu]] and [[asthma]] and had a poor free skate. After the original program, she dropped from second place and finished seventh overall.{{sfn|Prouse|Harding|2008|pages=96-98}} Harding was a powerful free skater and typically had lower placements in the [[compulsory figures]].&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/17/sports/figure-skating-harding-takes-singles-title.html|title=Harding Takes Singles Title|first=Micheal|last=Janofsky|newspaper=New York Times|date=Feb 17, 1991|accessdate=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1988/01/07/Figure-Skating-Results/3923568530000/|title=1988 U.S. Figure Skating Championships Results|department=Senior-level Ladies|agency=United Press International (UPI)|date=Jan 7, 1988|access-date=2018-07-27|quote=Tonya Harding ranked 8th out of 19th in Compulsory Figures}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harding's breakthrough year came in 1991 when, at the [[1991 United States Figure Skating Championships|U.S. Championships]], she completed her first [[triple Axel]] in competition on February 16 — the first American woman to execute the jump.&lt;ref name=nyt910312&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/12/sports/figure-skating-a-triple-axel-with-rippling-effects.html |title=A Triple Axel With Rippling Effects |first=Michael |last=Janofsky |newspaper=New York Times |date=March 12, 1991|accessdate=2017-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; She won the 1991 U.S. Ladies' Singles title with the event's first 6.0 technical merit score since [[Janet Lynn]]'s 1973 performance at the U.S. Championships.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; At the March 1991 World Championships, an international event, she again completed the triple Axel. Harding would finish second behind [[Kristi Yamaguchi]], and in front of Nancy Kerrigan, marking the first time one country swept the ladies medal podium at the [[World Figure Skating Championships]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/17/sports/figure-skating-skating-sweep-for-the-us-women.html|title=Skating Sweep for the U.S. Women|first=Michael|last=Janofsky|newspaper=New York Times|date=March 17, 1991|accessdate=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the September [[1991 Skate America]] competition, Harding recorded three more firsts:
* The first woman to complete a triple Axel in the short program
* The first woman to successfully execute two triple Axels in a single competition
* The first ever to complete a triple Axel in combination (with the double [[toe loop]])

Despite these record-breaking performances, after 1991, Harding was never able to successfully complete the triple Axel in competition again; her competitive results began to decline. She and Dody Teachman had briefly parted ways in April 1991, but had reunited in June;&lt;ref name="Not Your Average Ice Queen" /&gt; Harding was still training under Teachman for the upcoming 1992 season. She placed third in the January [[1992 U.S. Figure Skating Championships]] despite twisting her ankle during practice, and finished fourth in the February [[1992 Winter Olympics]]. On March 1, 1992, Harding gave Teachman a summary dismissal and returned to Diane Rawlinson to be coached by her.&lt;ref name="Hersh"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-03-08/sports/9201220344_1_diane-rawlinson-dody-teachman-tonya-harding|title=Adulation On Hold For Tonya Harding|first=Phil|last=Hersh|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=March 8, 1992|accessdate=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 29 Harding placed sixth in the [[1992 World Figure Skating Championships|1992 World Championships]], although she had a better placement at the November [[1992 Skate Canada International]] event finishing fourth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.onthisday.com/date/1992/march/29 |title=What Happened on March 29, 1992|website=OnThisDay.com (Today in History Archives)|department=Ladies Figure Skating Championship in Oakland won by Kristi Yamaguchi|editor-last=Graham|editor-first=James|orig-year=2000|accessdate=2018-08-05|postscript= → Kristi Yamaguchi would have won the event on the same day as the other Ladies' Singles free skate}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Haight|Vader|1994|p=35}} In the 1993 season, she skated poorly in the U.S. Championships and failed to qualify for the World Championship team.

In 1994, Harding won the U.S. Championships, but was later stripped of her title because of her involvement in the attack on Nancy Kerrigan. Kerrigan was unable to participate in the U.S. Championships due to her injury. Despite the legal controversy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/05/sports/olympics-ioc-official-says-harding-should-skate.html|title=I.O.C.

After an issue with a broken skate lace, she was given a re-skate in the long program and finished in eighth place, far behind [[Oksana Baiul]] (gold) and Nancy Kerrigan (silver).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/tonya-harding/1994/02/1994_winter_olympics_tonya_har.html|title=Tonya Harding finishes 8th in women's figure skating|work=OregonLive.com|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the competition results were not changed and the title was left vacant rather than moving all the other competitors up one position.&lt;ref name="1994-title"&gt;{{cite news |title=U.S. Title Is Taken Back From Harding |agency=Associated Press |newspaper=New York Times|date=July 1, 1994 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/01/sports/figure-skating-us-title-is-taken-back-from-harding.html |accessdate=2010-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attack on Nancy Kerrigan and aftermath ==

On {{start date|1994|1|6}}, one day before the [[1994 United States Figure Skating Championships|U.S. Figure Skating Championship]] first Ladies' Singles competition, [[Nancy Kerrigan]] was attacked after a practice session at the Detroit [[Cobo Center|Cobo Arena]]. The assailant was Shane Stant, contracted to break her right leg.&lt;ref name="anatomy of plot"/&gt; Stant and his uncle, Derrick Smith, were hired for this [[assault]] by Harding's ex-husband, Jeff Gillooly, and her one-time bodyguard, Shawn Eckardt.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sportsworld.nbcsports.com/nancy-tonya/].

Using both hands, he then swung a 21-inch [[ASP, Inc.|ASP]] [[telescopic baton]] at her right leg, striking her above the knee. The intent was preventing her competing in both the National Championships (Kerrigan was the defending [[1993 U.S. Figure Skating Championships|1993 U.S. Ladies' Champion]]) and the Winter Olympics. Kerrigan's leg was not broken but severely bruised, forcing her to withdraw from the Championships and forgo competing to retain the U.S. Ladies' title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/07/sports/figure-skating-kerrigan-attacked-after-practice-assailant-flees.html|title=Kerrigan Attacked After Practice; Assailant Flees

Shortly before the [[1998 Winter Olympics]], the [[CBS News|CBS]] and [[Fox Sports|Fox]] news divisions re-examined the scandal for two televised [[special report]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/specials/olympics/nagano/021798oly-tv-sports.html|title=TV Sports: CBS Provides Entertaining Moments|first=Richard|last=Sandomir|newspaper=New York Times|date=Feb 17, 1998 |accessdate=July 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://apnews.com/2778394bd828127ee9f32fb76299fa55 |title=Nancy &amp; Tonya, Together|first=J|last=Dubow |newspaper=AP|date=1998-02-05|accessdate=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harry Smith (American journalist)|Harry Smith]] hosted the CBS special. He reported that Harding still held to her statement from her press-conference given on January 27, 1994: "I had no prior knowledge of the planned assault on Nancy Kerrigan." Smith then interviewed Kerrigan, asking how she responded to that statement.  Nancy Kerrigan referred to transcripts she had read from Harding's FBI interview on January 18, 1994. After reading through the interrogation of that day, she concluded that "[Tonya] knew more than she admits."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1994/03/07/130609/silver-belle-nancy-kerrigan-conquered-her-demons-but-couldnt-overcome-a-pixie-from-ukraine|first=E.

Stone reflected on Harding's position of "limited involvement" in Kerrigan's attack and speculated that a "guilty conscience" still troubled her. Brown then mediated a joint interview with both Kerrigan and Harding present. The two former competitors shared sincere desires for happy families and general well-wishes toward one other.

In Harding's 2008 biography, ''The Tonya Tapes'' (transcribed by Lynda D. Prouse from recorded interviews), she stated that she wanted to call the FBI in 1994 to reveal what she knew, but decided not to when Gillooly allegedly threatened her with death following a gunpoint gang rape by him and two other men she did not know. Jeff (Gillooly) Stone responded with surprise that groundless claims against him could be published and specifically contended her gang rape accusation to be "utterly ridiculous."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.today.com/news/tonya-harding-reveals-her-side-roller-coaster-life-1C9015579 |title=Tonya Harding reveals her side of 'roller-coaster life'|date=May 15, 2008|first=Mike|last=Celizic |accessdate=July 4, 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170901024350/https://www.today.com/news/tonya-harding-reveals-her-side-roller-coaster-life-1C9015579|archivedate=2017-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, ''[[Deadspin]]'' sought Jeff Stone for an interview and he again defended himself from the gunpoint gang rape allegation.

In 2014, Nancy Kerrigan addressed the scandal during a brief interview with sportscaster [[Bob Costas]]: "Whatever apology Tonya has given, I accept it. It's time for all us – I've always wished [Tonya] well – she has her own family, I have my family.

In 2002, Harding boxed against [[Paula Jones]] on the [[Fox Network|Fox TV network]] ''[[Celebrity Boxing]]'' event, winning the fight. On February 22, 2003, she made her official [[women's boxing|women's professional boxing]] debut, losing a four-round [[split decision]] against Samantha Browning on the undercard of [[Mike Tyson vs. Clifford Etienne]]. Harding's boxing career came about amid rumors that she was having financial difficulties and needed to fight in the ring to earn money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tonya Harding Loses in Pro Boxing Debut |url=http://www.ourmidland.com/news/article/Tonya-Harding-Loses-in-Pro-Boxing-Debut-7070027.php |first=Barry |last=Wilner |date=Feb 21, 2003 |newspaper=Midland Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt; She did another celebrity boxing match, on ''[[The Man Show]]'', and won against co-host [[Doug Stanhope]].

On March 23, 2004, it was reported that she canceled a planned boxing match against Tracy Carlton in [[Oakland, California]], because of an alleged death threat against her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Why Harding wasn't in bout / Manager cites death threats, skills of foe |url=http://www.sfgate.com/sports/article/Why-Harding-wasn-t-in-bout-Manager-cites-death-2777303.php

===''Dancing with the Stars''===
In April 2018, Harding was announced as one of the celebrities who would compete on [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 26)|season 26]] of ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]].'' She was partnered with professional dancer [[Sasha Farber]]. The couple reached the finals of the competition, where Harding finished in third place overall, behind [[Adam Rippon]] and [[Josh Norman]].

== Personal life ==

Mary Houlihan of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' called it "a mildly interesting take on a somewhat tired topic." She liked how the play explored issues of class and competition, as well as Raidt's performance – yet thought it lacked Harding's "edgy toughness." Houlihan also admired Kelli Simpkins' performance as "Joanne," Harding's coach. She praised Bordelon's direction for "[steering] the actors away from any broad, [[Camp (style)|campy]] interpretation" and Aibel's writing for "deftly [capturing] the despicable side of the story."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment/t-stage-drama-revisits-the-still-fascinating-kerrigan-harding-saga/|url-access=limited|last=Houlihan|first=Mary|title='T.' stage drama revisits the still-fascinating Kerrigan-Harding saga|date=May 27, 2017|newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times|accessdate=Aug 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Academic assessment ===
Because Harding admitted to obstructing the investigation of Nancy Kerrigan's assault, her name is often first associated with the 1994 scandal. However, numerous academic essays have theorized additional reasons, particularly considering her [[Social class in the United States|national class culture]] and past figure skating membership, for Harding's perceived [[social stigma]]tization.&lt;ref name= believermag.com&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Marshall |first=Sarah |url=https://believermag.com/remote-control/ |title=Remote Control: Tonya Harding, Nancy Kerrigan, and the Spectacles of Female Power &amp; Pain |magazine=The Believer|date=Jan 2014|accessdate=2017-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the book ''Women on Ice: Feminist Essays on the Tonya Harding/Nancy Kerrigan Spectacle'' was published, containing numerous essays analyzing Harding's public image.{{sfn|Baughman|2013|pages=i–v}} For example, Abigail Feder-Kane wrote that there existed "[[Overdetermination|overdetermined]] [[femininity]] in Ladies' Figure Skating...femininity and [[Women's sports|athleticism]] are mutually exclusive concepts in [[Culture of the United States|American culture]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Oates|first=Thomas P.|editor-last=Burns|editor-first=Gary|year=2016|title=A Companion to Popular Culture (Blackwell Companions in Cultural Studies)|url-access=subscription|pages=275; 282|chapter=Part 5: Pastimes &amp; Practices|department=Sports: Marketing of the Black Style &amp; Containing Gendered Threats|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=P2jWCgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=abigail%20feder-kane|isbn=9781405192057|oclc=959326257|ref=harv|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|access-date=Aug 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sam Stoloff believed that, during the scandal, the media placed a greater emphasis on Harding's [[Working class in the United States|class]] rather than her gender (femininity). He noted how she was subjected to a "litany of vaguely [[pejorative]] or mocking expressions" associated with "low class" cultural attributes, sometimes due to Harding's personal interests and hobbies. Stoloff theorized that Harding represented an American social class that required interpretation ("the class Other") as he referenced the [[Anthropology|anthropological]] tone of [[Susan Orlean]]'s 1994 essay "Figures in a Mall," written for ''[[The New Yorker]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stoloff|first=Sam|editor1-last=Birrell|editor1-first=Susan|editor2-last=McDonald|editor2-first=Mary G.|year=2000|pages=234–250|title=Reading Sport: Critical Essays on Power and Representation|orig-year=1995|department=Tonya Harding, Nancy Kerrigan, &amp; the Bodily Figuration of Social Class|url-access=subscription|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=U4ukmwWWzgEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=sam%20stoloff|oclc=43036842|isbn=1555534309|ref=harv|publisher=Northeastern University Press|access-date=Aug 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Orlean" /&gt;

In academic Sarah Marshall's 2014 essay entitled "Remote Control: Tonya Harding, Nancy Kerrigan, and the Spectacles of Female Power and Pain," she noted the pervasive role of the media in the 1994 scandal, particularly the manner in which Harding's life outside the realm of skating became publicly scrutinized: "Somehow, in the scandal's aftermath, the form of the Tonya-bash was able to alchemize even the most chilling details of Tonya's life into tabloid gold." Marshall also examined the role of Harding's "[[tomboy]]" persona in the context of figure skating. She theorized that Harding was rejected by the figure skating [[ethos]] because she did not conform – as Marshall believed many figure skaters including Nancy Kerrigan did – to appearing as "beautiful without being sexual, strong without being intimidating, and vulnerable without being weak."&lt;ref name=believermag.com/&gt;

In Tyler Chase Knowles' 2016 honors thesis entitled "Taking Out the Trash: Middle Class Anxieties and The White Trash Menace," he extrapolated on a quotation made by Emma Gray in her 2014 ''[[HuffPost]]'' article. The quotation explored how Gray believed Harding was labelled "the skating world's perfect villain" due to her appearance, [[Dysfunctional family|broken home]], and [[Poverty in the United States|impoverished background]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/emma-gray/nancy-kerrigan-tonya-harding-the-price-of-gold_b_4578036.html|department=The Blog|title=What We Missed About The Nancy Kerrigan-Tonya Harding Scandal 20 Years Ago|first=Emma|last=Gray|newspaper=HuffPost|date=Jan 10, 2014|accessdate=Aug 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knowles theorized that there also existed the [[Sociocultural perspective|socio-cultural]] personified "Defender" who also chose to reject Harding. He defined the "Defender" as a person or persons who sympathize(s) with the [[working poor]], a group including the [[Poor white|white underclass]]. The "Defender" would blame the plight of the poor on [[Economic sociology|societal]] and [[Income inequality in the United States|economic]] factors, yet the "Defender" would continue to reinforce [[Normality (behavior)|conventional values]] such as [[Class stratification|distinguishing the class border]]. Knowles argued that Harding did not belong in the "Defender's" approved category of "poor white" because she did not – in the opinion of the "Defender" – make enough effort, given her figure skating membership, to [[Cultural assimilation|assimilate]] towards [[elite culture]]. The "Defender" wanted Tonya Harding to use her USFSA membership for [[social mobility]], caring little whether she could prove herself to be [[High performance sport|among the best Olympic competitors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Knowles|first=Tyler Chase|date=April 2016|publication-place=Connecticut|title=Taking Out the Trash: Middle Class Anxieties and The White Trash Menace|department=The Perfect Woman: A Case Study on Tonya Harding|type=Honors Thesis|chapter=2|publisher=Faculty of Wesleyan University |url=https://wesscholar.wesleyan.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://scholar.google.ca/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=2584&amp;context=etd_hon_theses|access-date=Aug 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17536">'''Transcortical sensory aphasia''' ('''TSA''') is a kind of [[aphasia]] that involves damage to specific areas of the [[temporal lobe]] of the [[brain]], resulting in symptoms such as poor auditory comprehension, relatively intact repetition, and fluent speech with semantic paraphasias present.&lt;ref&gt;
&lt;Manasco, M. (2014). Chapter 7: Motor Speech Disorders: The Dysarthrias. In Introduction to neurogenic communication disorders . Burlington, MA: Jones &amp; Barlett Learning.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; TSA is a fluent aphasia similar to [[Wernicke's aphasia]] (receptive aphasia), with the exception of a strong ability to repeat words and phrases.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.asha.org/Practice-Portal/Clinical-Topics/Aphasia/Common-Classifications-of-Aphasia/|title = Common Classifications of Aphasia|date = |accessdate = |website = American Speech-Language Hearing Association (ASHA)|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The person may repeat questions rather than answer them ("echolalia").&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In all of these ways, TSA is very similar to a more commonly known language disorder, receptive aphasia. However, transcortical sensory aphasia differs from receptive aphasia in that patients still have intact repetition and exhibit [[echolalia]], or the compulsive repetition of words.&lt;ref name="cognitive"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Banich |first1= Marie T. |last2= Compton |first2= Rebecca J. |title= Cognitive Neuroscience |publisher= [[Cengage Learning]] |pages= 238–239 |year= 2010 |edition= Third |isbn= 0-8400-3298-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transcortical sensory aphasia cannot be diagnosed through brain imaging techniques such as [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), as the results are often difficult to interpret. Therefore, clinicians rely on language assessments and observations to determine if a patient presents with the characteristics of TSA. Patients diagnosed with TSA have shown partial recovery of speech and comprehension after beginning [[Speech and language pathology|speech therapy]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} Speech therapy methods for patients with any subtype of aphasia are based on the principles of learning and [[neuroplasticity]]. Clinical research on TSA is limited because it occurs so infrequently in patients with aphasia that it is very difficult to perform systematic studies.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

TSA should not be confused with [[transcortical motor aphasia]] (TMA), which is characterized by nonfluent speech output, with good comprehension and repetition. Patients with TMA have impaired writing skills, difficulty speaking and difficulty maintaining a clear thought process.&lt;ref name="cognitive"/&gt; Furthermore, TMA is caused by [[lesion]]s in cortical motor areas of the brain as well as lesions in the anterior portion of the [[basal ganglia]], and can be seen in patients with [[expressive aphasia]].&lt;ref name="blueprints"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Drislane |first1= Frank W. |last2= Benatar |first2= Michael |author3=Bernard S. Change |author4=Juan A. Acosta |author5=John E. Croom |author6=Andrew Tarulli |author7=Louis R. Caplan |title= Blueprints Neurology |publisher= Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |date=March 2006 |isbn= 1-4051-0463-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Affected brain areas==

[[File:Gehirn, lateral - Lobi + Stammhirn + Cerebellum eng.svg|thumb|Damage to the inferior left temporal lobe, which is shown in green, is associated with TSA]]

Transcortical sensory aphasia is caused by lesions in the inferior left [[temporal lobe]] of the [[brain]] located near [[Wernicke's area]], and is usually due to minor [[bleeding|hemorrhage]] or [[bruise|contusion]] in the temporal lobe, or [[infarction|infarcts]] of the left [[posterior cerebral artery]] (PCA).&lt;ref name="blueprints"/&gt; One function of the [[arcuate fasciculus]] is the connection between Wernicke’s and [[Broca’s area]]. In TSA Wernicke’s and Broca’s areas are spared, meaning that lesions do not occur in these regions of the brain. However, since the arcuate fasciculus, Wernicke's area, and Broca's area are secluded from the rest of the brain in TSA, patients still have intact repetition (as information from the arcuate fasciculus is relayed to Broca’s area), but cannot attach meaning to words, either spoken or heard.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Characteristics==

Transcortical sensory aphasia is characterized as a fluent aphasia. [[Fluency]] is determined by direct qualitative observation of the patient’s speech to determine the length of spoken phrases, and is usually characterized by a normal or rapid rate; normal phrase length, [[rhythm]], melody, and articulatory agility; and normal or paragrammatic speech.&lt;ref name="nadeau"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Nadeau |first1= Stephen E. |last2= Rothi |first2= Leslie J. |last3= Crosson |first3= Bruce |title= Aphasia and Language: Theory to Practice |publisher= Guilford |year= 2000 |pages= 31–39 |isbn= 1-57230-581-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transcortical sensory aphasia is a disorder in which there is a discrepancy between [[phonological rule|phonological processing]], which remains intact, and [[lexical semantics|lexical-semantic processing]], which is impaired.&lt;ref name="boatman"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Boatman |first1= D.|last2= Gordon |first2= B. |year= 2000 |title= Transcortical Sensory Aphasia: Revistied and Revised |journal= Brain |volume= 123 |issue= 8 |pages= 1634–42 |pmid= 10908193 |doi= 10.1093/brain/123.8.1634 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, patients can repeat complicated phrases, however they lack comprehension and propositional speech. This disconnect occurs since Wernicke’s area is not damaged in patients with TSA, therefore repetition is spared while comprehension is affected. Patients with intact repetition can repeat both simple and complex phrases spoken by others, e.g. when asked if the patient would like to go for a walk, he or she would respond "go for walk." Although patients can respond appropriately, due to the extent of their TSA, it is most likely that they do not comprehend what others ask them. In addition to problems in comprehension, transcortical sensory aphasia is further characterized based on deficits in naming and paraphasia.&lt;ref name="cognitive"/&gt;

===Verbal comprehension===

Impaired verbal comprehension can be the result  a number of causes such as failure of speech sound discrimination, word recognition, auditory [[working memory]], or syntactic structure building. When clinically examined, patients with TSA will exhibit poor comprehension of verbal commands.&lt;ref name="blueprints"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nadeau"/&gt; Based on the extent of the comprehension deficiency, patients will have difficulty following simple commands, e.g. “close your eyes.” Depending on the extent of affected brain area, patients are able to follow simple commands but may not be able to comprehend more difficult, multistep commands, e.g. “point to the ceiling, then touch your left ear with your right hand."&lt;ref name="blueprints"/&gt; Verbal commands as such, that require the patient to cross over the midline of their body are typically more taxing than commands that involve solely the right or left side. When increasing the complexity of verbal commands comprehension is often tested by varying the grammatical structure of the command to determine whether or not the patient understands different grammatical variations of the same sentence. Commands involving the passive voice or possessive, e.g. "If the snake killed the mouse, which one is still alive," usually result in comprehension problems in those who can understand simple questions.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Naming===

Naming involves the ability to recall an object. Patients with TSA, as well as patients with all other aphasia subtypes, exhibit poor naming.&lt;ref name="nadeau"/&gt; Clinical assessment of naming involves the observer first asking the patient to name high frequency objects such as clock, door, and chair. TSA patients who name common objects with ease generally have difficulty naming both uncommon objects and specific parts of objects such as lapel, or the dial on a watch.&lt;ref name="blueprints"/&gt;

===Paraphasia===

Patients with TSA typically exhibit paraphasia; their speech is fluent but often error-prone. Their speech is often unintelligible as they tend to use the wrong words, e.g. tree instead of train or uses words in senseless and incorrect combinations.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Diagnosis==

===Clinical assessment===

[[Receptive aphasia|Sensory aphasia]] is typically diagnosed by [[Invasiveness of surgical procedures|non-invasive]] evaluations. [[Neurologists]], [[Neuropsychology|neuropsychologists]] or [[Speech and language pathology|speech pathologists]] will administer oral evaluations to determine the extent of a patient’s comprehension and speech capability.&lt;ref name="browndyke"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.neuropsychologycentral.com |title= Aphasia Assessment |last1= Browndyke |first1= J.N. |year= 2002 |publisher= Telepyschology Solutions |accessdate=26 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial assessment will determine if the cause of [[linguistics|linguistic]] deficiency is aphasia. If the diagnosis is then confirmed, testing will next address the type of aphasia and its severity. The [[Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination]] specializes in determining the severity of a sensory aphasia through the observation of conversational behaviors. Several modalities of perception and response are observed in conjunction with the subject’s ability to process sensory information.&lt;ref name="murdoch"&gt;{{cite book |author=Bruce E. Murdoch |title=Acquired Speech and Language Disorders |publisher=Wiley |location=New York |year=2009 |pages=4–16|isbn=0-470-02567-0 |oclc=652484816|doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The location of the brain lesion and type of the aphasia can then be inferred from the observed symptoms. The Minnesota Test for Differential Diagnosis is the most lengthy and thorough assessment of sensory aphasia. It pinpoints weaknesses in the auditory and visual senses, as well as reading comprehension. From this differential diagnosis, a patient’s course of treatment can be determined. After treatment planning, the Porch Index of Communicative Ability is used to evaluate prognosis and the degree of recovery.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Imaging===

[[File:User-FastFission-brain.gif|thumb|[[functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] is a measure of the increase in blood flow to localized areas of the brain that coincide with neural activity and is used to image brain activity related to a specific task or sensory process. It is a commonly used method for imaging brain activity in aphasia patients.]]

Sensory aphasia cannot be diagnosed through the use of imaging techniques. Differences in [[cognition]] between asymptomatic subjects and affected patients can be observed via [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI).&lt;ref name="noggle"&gt;{{cite book |author=Arthur MacNeill Horton Jr EdD ABPP ABPN; Chad Noggle MD; Raymond Dean ABPP ABPN |title=The Encyclopedia of Neuropsychological Disorders |publisher=Springer Publishing Company |location=New York |year=2011 |pages=311–312 |isbn=0-8261-9854-6 |oclc=763157304 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these results only reveal temporal differences in cognition between control and diagnosed subjects. The degree of progression during therapy can also be surveyed through cognition tests monitored by fMRI. Many patients’ progress is assessed over time via repeated testing and corresponding cerebral imaging by fMRI.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Management==

Due to advances in modern neuroimaging, scientists have been able to gain a better understanding of how language is learned and comprehended.  Based on the new data from the world of [[neuroscience]], improvements can be made in coping with the disorder.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Therapists have been developing multiple methods of improving speech and comprehension.  These techniques utilize three general principles: maximizing therapy occurrences, ensuring behavioral and communicative relevance, and allowing patients to focus on the language tools that are still available in his or her repertoire.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Many of the following treatment techniques are used to improve auditory comprehension in patients with aphasia:
* Using common words
* Using concrete [[noun]]s is more effective than using [[adjective]]s, [[adverb]]s, or [[verb]]s
* Using action verbs that are easily imagined
* Concise and grammatically simple sentences as opposed to lengthy sentences
* Speaking slowly, repeating oneself several times when conversing with aphasic patients
* Using gestures{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

A relatively new method of language therapy involves coincidence learning. Coincidence learning focuses on the simultaneous learning of two or more events and stipulates that these events are wired together in the brain, strengthening the learning process.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} Therapists use coincidence learning to find and improve language correlations or coincidences that have been either damaged or deleted by severe cases of aphasia, such as transcortical sensory aphasia.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} This technique is important in brain function and recovery, as it strengthens associated brain areas that remain unaffected after brian damage.  It can be achieved with intensive therapy hours in order to maximize time where correlation is emphasized.&lt;ref name="friedemann"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Pulvermüller |first1= Friedemann |last2= Berthier |first2= Marcelo |year= 2007 |title= Aphasia Therapy on a Neuroscience Basis |journal= Aphasiology |volume= 22 |issue= 6 |pages= 563–599 |pmc= 2557073 |doi= 10.1080/02687030701612213 |pmid=18923644}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through careful analysis of neuroimaging studies, a correlation has been developed with motor function and the understanding of action verbs.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}  For example, leg and motor areas were seen to be activated words such as "kick", leading scientists to understand the connection between motor and language processes in the brain.  This is yet another example of using relationships that are related in the brain for the purpose of rehabilitating speech and comprehension.&lt;ref name="friedemann"/&gt;

Of huge importance in aphasia therapy is the need to start practicing as soon as possible.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}  Greater recovery occurs when a patient attempts to improve their comprehension and speaking soon after aphasia occurs.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} There is an inverse relationship between the length of time spent not practicing and level of recovery.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}  The patient should be pushed to their limits of verbal communication in order for them to practice and build upon their remaining language skills.&lt;ref name="friedemann"/&gt;

One effective therapy technique is using what are known as language games in order to encourage verbal communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pulvermüller F, Neininger B, Elbert T |title=Constraint-induced therapy of chronic aphasia after stroke |journal=Stroke |volume=32 |issue=7 |pages=1621–6 |date=July 2001 |pmid=11441210 |doi=10.1161/01.STR.32.7.1621  |url= |displayauthors=etal  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  One famous example is known as "Builder's Game", where a 'builder' and a 'helper' must communicate in order to effectively work on a project.  The helper must hand the builder the tools he or she may need, which requires effective oral communication.  The builder succeeds by requesting tools from the assistant by usually using single word utterances, such as 'hammer' or 'nail'.  Thus, when the helper hands the tool to the builder, the game incorporates action with language, a key therapy technique.  The assistant would then hand the builder the requested tool.  Success of the game occurs when the builder's requests are specific to ensure successful building.&lt;ref name="friedemann"/&gt;

Ultimately, regardless of therapy plan or method, improvement in speech does not appear overnight; it requires a significant time investment by the patient as well as a dedicated speech therapist seeking to ensure that the patient is focusing on the correct speech tasks outside of the clinic.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}  Furthermore, the patient must collaborate with friends and family members during their free time in order to maximize the efficacy of the treatment.&lt;ref name="efficacy"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Basso |first1= Anna|last2= Macis |first2= Margherita |year= 2011 |title= Therapy Efficacy in Chronic Aphasia |journal= Behavioral Neurology |volume= 24 |issue= 4 |pages= 317–325 |doi= 10.3233/BEN-2011-0342 |pmid= 22063820}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Transnational Radical Party''' ('''TRP'''), whose official name is '''Nonviolent Radical Party, Transnational and Transparty''' ('''NRPTT'''), is a political association of citizens, members of parliament and members of government of various national and political backgrounds who intend to adopt [[nonviolence|nonviolent]] means to create an effective body of [[international law]] with respect for individuals, [[human rights|human]], [[civil and political rights]], as well as the affirmation of [[democracy]] and [[political freedom]] in the world.

The TRP does not participate in elections, and despite being named "party", is a [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO), adept in building synergies among political forces aimed at achieving the goals of its congressional motions.

The TRP is the direct evolution of the Italian [[Radical Party (Italy)|Radical Party]] (1955–89) and is separate from the once-connected [[Italian Radicals]] party (founded in 2001), has been an NGO at the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC) of the [[United Nations]] (UN) since 1995, listed in the general consultative status' category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esa.un.org/coordination/ngo/search/DisplayOrgInfo.asp?OrgID=655|title=1 June is the last day to apply for consultative status with ECOSOC|publisher=|accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The TRP often advocates the international use of [[Esperanto]] in its literature.&lt;ref name="eo"&gt;[http://en.nitobe.info/ld/dokumentujo/dokumento.php?id=30&amp;priskribolingvo=en The International Politics of Esperanto] at the Nitobe Center for Language Democracy&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{further|Italian Radicals (disambiguation)|Pannella List|Bonino List|Italian Radicals}}

The TRP's forerunner, the [[Radical Party (Italy)|Radical Party]] (PR), was established in 1955 by a left-wing splinter group from the centre-right [[Italian Liberal Party]] (PLI). In 1989 the PR was transformed into the TRP. In 1992 a majority of the Radicals formed, at the national-level in Italian politics, the [[Pannella List]], as its most senior figure was [[Marco Pannella]]. Since 1999 the List ran in elections under the banner of [[Bonino List]], named after [[Emma Bonino]]. In 2001 the Radicals in Italy formed the [[Italian Radicals]] (RI).

===Background and foundation===
In the [[European Parliament election, 1979 (Italy)|first European Parliament election in 1979]] the PR obtained its best result ever countrywide (3.7% of the vote, resulting in the election of three [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]s, including Pannella). Following the election, the PR was involved with the [[European Green Party|Coordination of European Green and Radical Parties]] (CEGRP) and its unsuccessful efforts to create a single pan-European platform for green and radical politics.&lt;ref name="Bomberg2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Elizabeth Bomberg|title=Green Parties and Politics in the European Union|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A7WIAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA70|date=2 August 2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-85145-4|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, since then, the party projected itself into international politics.

In 1988, after a decade during which transnational issues and values were emphasised, the PR's congress decided that the party would be transformed during 1989 into the TRP and that the latter would not present itself in elections (in order to avoid competition with the other parties and stimulate cooperation instead), while permitting "dual membership" with other parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Un programma politico|author=Sergio Stanzani|url=http://www.radioradicale.it/exagora/un-programma-politico|journal=Notizie Radicali|issue=51|date=11 March 1988|access-date=26 February 2017|language=IT}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new symbol featuring the stylised face of [[Mahatma Gandhi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radioradicale.it/exagora/il-simbolo-di-gandhi-fa-la-differenza|title=Il simbolo di Gandhi fa la differenza|author=Gianfranco Spadaccia|journal= Atti del convegno “I radicali e la nonviolenza: un metodo, una speranza”|location=Roma|date=29-30 April 1988|access-date=26 February 2016|language=IT}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the point of no return in the transformation of the PR into an instrument of political fight completely at disposal of issue-oriented campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lettera aperta di Mauro Mellini al Primo segretario del Partito Radicale Sergio Stanzani|journal=Notizie Radicali|date=30 November 1988|url=http://www.radioradicale.it/exagora/lettera-aperta-di-mauro-mellini-al-primo-segretario-del-partito-radicale-sergio-stanzani|issue=262|access-date=26 February 2017|language=IT}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Massimo Teodori|title=L'illusione transnazionale e transpartitica|journal=Marco Pannella — un eretico liberale nella crisi della repubblica|publisher=Casa editrice Marsilio|location=Venezia|date=1996|url=http://www.eclettico.org/cr/libri/teodori/diaspora.htm#_Toc490915674|access-date=26 February 2017|language=IT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All this provoked great controversy among Radicals. Some long-time members left in order to continue their own activity in other parties or retire from public life. However, also most TRP Radicals continued to be actively engaged in politics, sometimes supported by the TRP itself, sometimes seeking hospitality in traditional parties or creating entirely new electoral lists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radicalparty.org/it/content/lorganizzazione-politica-dellantiproibizionismo|title=L'organizzazione politica dell'antiproibizionismo|date=1 July 1991|access-date=26 February 2016|language=IT}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isimbolidelladiscordia.it/2016/05/in-memoria-di-marco-pannella-una-storia.html|title=In memoria di Marco Pannella: una storia, tanti simboli|date=19 May 2016|access-date=26 February 2017|author=Gabriele Maestri|language=IT}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[European Parliament election, 1989 (Italy)|1989 European Parliament election]] Pannella stood as a successful candidate of the joint list between the PLI (his former party) and the [[Italian Republican Party]], some Radicals formed the "Anti-prohibition List on Drugs" (1 MEP), while others joined the [[Rainbow Greens]] (2 MEPs). In the run-up of the [[Italian general election, 1992|1992 general election]] the Pannella List was formed.

[[Sergio Stanzani]] and [[Emma Bonino]] were the first secretary and president of the party, respectively. In 1993 Bonino, who would be appointed to the [[European Commission]] in 1995, replaced Stanzani, and Pannella became president.

===International activities and ECOSOC recognition===
The TRP was soon involved in comparing the conditions of the [[rule of law]] among different democracies throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ISBN= 9788840400587|first=Massimo|last= Lensi|title=Oltre Chiasso|publisher=Nardini Editore|location= Firenze|year=2016|url=http://www.nardinieditore.it/prodotto/oltre-chiasso-il-mio-viaggio-con-marco-pannella-e-il-partito-radicale-transnazionale/|quote=The Transnational Radical Party is one of Marco Pannella's most interesting insights.

In 1995, after an intense institutional work, the TRP became a non-governmental organization for the promotion of human rights' legislation and the affirmation of democracy and freedom worldwide. As such, it was granted the general consultative status at the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC) of the [[United Nations]] (UN).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Onu/riconoscimento ngo del partito radicale|author=Marino Busdachin|date=21 June 1995|journal= appunto di Marino Busdachin per la conferenza segreteria e per Marco Pannella|url=http://www.radioradicale.it/exagora/onu-riconoscimento-ngo-del-partito-radicale-0|access-date=26 February 2017|language=IT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1995 [[Olivier Dupuis]], a long-time Radical from [[Belgium]] and founding member of the TRP who had moved to [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]] in 1988 and from there had coordinated TRP's activities in Eastern Europe, was elected secretary of the party, while [[Jean-François Hory]], a [[France|French]] MEP of the [[Radical Party of the Left]] within the TRP-sponsored [[European Radical Alliance]] group, was president.

==="Italian plague", decline and internal crisis===
Despite its successes worldwide, the TRP and its initiaves mostly failed to find space on the local press in Italy, which has often focused merely on the internal conflicts within the Radical world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Luca Gelmini|url=http://www.corriere.it/Primo_Piano/Politica/2006/10_Ottobre/31/radicali.shtml|title=Radicali, scontro Pannella-Capezzone|journal=Corriere della Sera|date=1 November 2006|access-date=20 March 2017|language=IT}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://formiche.net/2013/10/29/pannella-staderini-ecco-quanto-si-amano-si-odiano-i-radicali-italiani/|title=Pannella e Staderini, quanto si amano (e si odiano) i Radicali italiani|author=Paolo Falliro|date=2013-10-29|access-date=2017-03-20|language=IT}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rainews.it/dl/rainews/articoli/Pannella-caccia-la-Bonino-lei-replica-Siete-scemi-38bd6015-d105-4a47-b58d-2cc150dc6b14.html|title=Pannella caccia la Bonino, lei replica: "Siete scemi?"|access-date=5 December 2017|date=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inadequate information on Radical initiatives by the Italian media has been meticulously verified by the TRP-sponsored ''Centro d'Ascolto dell'Informazione Radiotelevisiva''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centrodiascolto.it/content/la-storia|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621073456/http://www.centrodiascolto.it/content/la-storia|dead-url=yes|archive-date=21 June 2008|title=Centro d’Ascolto dell’Informazione Radiotelevisiva|quote=|access-date=20 March 2017|language=IT}}&lt;/ref&gt; and produced several sentences featuring compensations to be paid by [[RAI]], the Italian public broadcaster, and commercial TV as well. Some confusion came from the fact that since the 2000s, rather than highlighting its expansion abroad, the TRP has preferred to focus on the "Case Italy", emblematic of the decadence of a constitutional political system into a "real democracy", that is to say a formal democracy in which its very institutions substantially act in contrast with the constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radioradicale.it/exagora/il-caso-italia-1-introduzione-lo-stato-della-giustizia-in-europa-i-convegno|title=IL CASO ITALIA: (1) Introduzione - LO STATO DELLA GIUSTIZIA IN EUROPA - I· CONVEGNO|access-date=2017-03-20|language=IT}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Marco Pannella|date=10 October 1989|title=Diritti democratici nella "Democrazia reale"|journal=IL GIORNALE D’ITALIA|access-date=20 March 2017|quote=|url=http://www.radioradicale.it/exagora/diritti-democratici-nella-democrazia-reale|language=IT}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the TRP, Italy has become a "[[Particracy|partycratic]] regime" and, as such, has started to spread the "plague" of "real democracy" around the democratic world. That was denounced by Radicals within international organisations and though the publication of a "yellow book" on the "Italian plague".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|author=Gruppo di Iniziativa di Satyagraha 2009 per lo Stato di diritto e la Democrazia cancellati in Italia|title=La Peste Italiana|url=http://www.radicali.it/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/peste_italiana.pdf|access-date=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the TRP effectively suffered internal problems too. In 2003 Dupuis resigned from secretary because of serious political differences with Pannella. In 2011–14 [[Demba Traoré (politician)|Demba Traoré]], a politician from [[Mali]], served briefly as secretary: he left the party without officially resigning, after being returned to the government of his own country. The TRP was later provisionally run by a committee, known as the "Senate" (''Senato''), led by Pannella and composed of the party's leading members.

===Re-organisation and split of the Italian Radicals===
After the death of Pannella in May 2016, an extraordinary congress was convened in September to overcome the long inactivity due to the absence of the secretary, as well as the economic problems undermining the party's viability. The congress adopted with 178 votes in favour, 79 against and 13 abstentions on the final resolution:
*set three main goals (1. affirmation of the rule of law and the human right of knowledge; 2. justice reform in Italy, including pardon, amnesty, abolition of the [[article 41-bis prison regime]] and of life sentences; 3. formation of the [[United States of Europe]], inspired on the [[Ventotene Manifesto]]);
*set a membership target of 3,000 members for 2017 and 2018 in order to pay for the party's debts, otherwise the TRP would be dissolved;
*suspended the party's organs (president, secretary, treasurer, senate, etc.), with the exception of the congress;
*elected a collective leadership led by [[Rita Bernardini]], [[Antonella Casu]], [[Sergio D'Elia]] and [[Maurizio Turco]] (legal representative).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radicalparty.org/it/content/mozione-generale-del-40esimo-congresso-straordinario-del-partito-radicale-nonviolento-transn|title=MOZIONE GENERALE DEL 40ESIMO CONGRESSO STRAORDINARIO DEL PARTITO RADICALE NONVIOLENTO, TRANSNAZIONALE E TRANSPARTITO|publisher=|accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radicalparty.org/it/content/i-furbetti-del-partitino-consulenza-i-compagni-espulsi-o-di-espulsione|title=I furbetti del partitino (consulenza per i compagni espulsi o in via di espulsione)|publisher=|accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1380">In [[law]] and [[philosophy]], '''voluntariness''' is a choice being made of a person's [[free will]], as opposed to being made as the result of [[coercion]] or [[duress]]. Philosophies such as [[libertarianism]] and [[voluntaryism]], as well as many legal systems, hold that a contract must be voluntarily agreed to by a party in order to be binding on that party. The [[social contract]] rests on the concept of the voluntary [[consent of the governed]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

The [[Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure]] provide that "Before accepting a plea of guilty or [[nolo contendere]], the court must address the defendant personally in open court and determine that the plea is voluntary and did not result from force, threats, or promises (other than promises in a plea agreement)."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcrmp/Rule11.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The actual voluntariness is suspect, in that it is common for prosecutors to threaten to seek more prison time unless the defendant agrees to plead guilty. For this reason, [[common law]] courts historically took a negative view of guilty pleas.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/clr79&amp;section=11|title=Plea bargaining and its history|author=AW Alschuler|publisher=Colum L.
