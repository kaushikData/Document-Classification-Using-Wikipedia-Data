Community '''assembly rules''' are a set of controversial rules in [[ecology]], first proposed by [[Jared Diamond]].&lt;ref name="Diamond1975"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ecology and Evolution of Communities |editor=Cody ML, Diamond JM |publisher=Belknap Press, [[Harvard University Press]] |location=Cambridge, MA |year=1975 |url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674224445 |pages=342&amp;ndash;444}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==

The rules were developed after more than a decade of research into the avian assemblages on islands near [[New Guinea]]. The rules assert that competition is responsible for determining the patterns of assemblage composition.  Diamond's paper sparked nearly two decades worth of controversy in the literature, from the late seventies through the late nineties{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} and is considered a turning point in community ecology{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}. The disagreement continues to this day.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

===Rule 1: Forbidden species combinations===
The first rule is "forbidden species combinations". Diamond's hypothesis was that competition, not random immigration, was the main force structuring the species composition of islands.

So for example, the [[Bismarck black myzomela]] (''Myzomela pammelaena'') excludes the [[black sunbird]] (''Nectarinia sericea''). The Bismarck black myzomela lives on 23 of the 41 surveyed islands in the Bismarck Archipelago, but not on any of the 14 islands inhabited by the black sunbird. The two birds are about the same size, and both use their curved bills to sip nectar; Diamond argued that competition affects their distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Erik Stokstad (2009) 'On the Origin of Ecological Structure', ''Science'' 2 Oct 2009 pp. 33&amp;ndash;35.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rule 2: Reduced niche overlap===

Case tested the assembly rule that species occurring together on islands should have less [[Ecological niche|niche]] overlap than random assemblages because they have undergone specialization.&lt;ref name="Ted1983"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Case |first=Ted |year=1983 |title=Niche overlap and the assembly of island lizard communities |jstor=3544102 |journal=Oikos |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=427&amp;ndash;433 |doi=10.2307/3544102}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His study measured niche overlap of lizards on 37 islands near [[Baja California]] and compared niche overlap to the median niche overlap of computer generated random species assemblages. Case found that 30 of the 37 islands had lower niche overlap than the random assemblages and that some of the competition is due to [[interspecific competition]].

==Testing==
Testing the assembly rules is a complex process that often uses computer simulations to compare experimental data with characteristics of random assemblages of species.  The rules are generally regarded as hypotheses that need to be tested on an individual basis, not as accepted conclusions.

==Alternative theory==

As a reaction to the assembly rules controversy, ecologist [[Stephen Hubbell]] proposed that the abundance and diversity of species in a community is determined mainly by random dispersal, speciation, and extinction. This came to be known as the [[unified neutral theory of biodiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Hubbell, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bae''''' is a [[slang]] [[term of endearment]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Solomon | first=Jane | title=The Baest Bae to Ever Bae: Bae Isn’t Just a Noun Anymore | website=Slate Magazine | date=January 22, 2015 | url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/lexicon_valley/2015/01/22/that_s_so_bae_not_just_a_noun_anymore_here_s_how_bae_gets_used_as_a_verb.html | accessdate=May 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; primarily used among youth in North America.  It came into widespread use around 2013 and 2014 through [[social media]] and [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] and [[Rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]] lyrics.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2015/05/selfie-stick-concern-troll-bae-new-words-oxforddictionaries-com/|title=Selfie stick, concern troll, and bae: new words added to OxfordDictionaries.com {{!}} OxfordWords blog|date=May 29, 2015|work=OxfordWords blog|access-date=May 15, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2014/11/oxford-dictionaries-word-year-2014-runners-up/|title=The Oxford Dictionaries Word of the Year 2014: runners-up {{!}} OxfordWords blog|date=November 18, 2014|work=OxfordWords blog|access-date=May 15, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It usually refers to a person's romantic partner, especially a boyfriend or girlfriend,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/bae|title=bae – definition of bae in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=May 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has also been used as a general term of affection for things, including inanimate objects.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/12/the-lamentable-death-of-bae/384086/|title=The Death of Bae|last=Hamblin|first=James|work=The Atlantic|access-date=May 15, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/12/28/7458195/brands-saying-bae-is-the-most-important-twitter-account-of-2014|title=Brands Saying Bae is the Twitter account we've needed in 2014|date=December 28, 2014|website=The Verge|access-date=May 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://time.com/3026192/this-is-what-bae-means/|title=This is What 'Bae' Means|last=Steinmetz|first=Katy|date=July 23, 2014|website=Time|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term originated as an abbreviation of the word "baby" or "babe".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.visualthesaurus.com/cm/dictionary/bae-watch-the-ascent-of-a-new-pet-name/|title="Bae" Watch: The Ascent of a New Pet Name|last=Whitman|first=Neal|date=March 27, 2014|website=Visual Thesaurus|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/22/opinion/sunday/a-wordnado-of-words-in-2013.html|title=A Wordnado of Words in 2013|last=Barrett|first=Grant|date=December 21, 2013|work=The New York Times|access-date=May 15, 2017|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been suggested that the term originated as an acronym for "before anyone else", but this is unlikely and this [[false etymology]] is probably an example of a [[backronym]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2016/10/false-acronyms/|title=Why you’re probably wrong about acronyms {{!}} OxfordWords blog|date=October 17, 2016|work=OxfordWords blog|access-date=May 15, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Popular usage ==
Several [[Internet meme]]s have caused the widespread adoption of the term.  "Bae caught me slippin{{'"}} featured people posting pictures of themselves pretending to be asleep that were supposedly taken by their partners.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Lexicographer [[Grant Barrett]] wrote that this was "a kind of incompetent narcissistic guile which may capture the spirit of our age."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.waywordradio.org/2013-words-of-the-year/|title=2013 Words of the Year|last=Barrett|first=Grant|date=December 19, 2013|website=A Way With Words|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Cooking for bae" featured people posting photos of failed dishes, often called "struggle meals", supposedly created for their partners.  "You got a bae? Or nah?" originated on [[Vine (service)|Vine]] and featured people chanting the phrase.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The word's use in song lyrics dates to at least 2005, according to lyrics posted on [[Genius (website)|Genius]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  In 2014, [[Pharrell Williams]] used it in the title of his single "[[Come Get It Bae]]".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/news/a29423/where-did-bae-come-from/|title=What the Hell is Up with 'Bae'?|last=Zarinsky|first=Natasha|date=July 25, 2014|work=Esquire|access-date=May 15, 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chris Kelly of ''[[Fact (UK magazine)|Fact]]'' wrote sarcastically that "nothing says timeless like a song with 'bae' in the title".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.factmag.com/2014/02/27/g-i-r-l/|title=GIRL|date=February 27, 2014|website=FACT Magazine: Music News, New Music.|access-date=May 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word was a runner-up for the [[OxfordDictionaries.com|Oxford Dictionaries]] 2014 Word of the Year.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Barrett nominated it for the [[American Dialect Society]]'s 2013 Word of the Year.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The term has been adopted by corporate social media.  The [[Twitter]] account Brands Saying Bae highlights the use of corporate Twitter accounts employing the term.  ''[[The Verge]]'' labeled this use as an "appropriation of urban youth culture".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=May 2013}}
[[Image:Beating Frequency.svg|thumb|214px|Diagram of beat frequency]]
In [[acoustics]], a '''beat''' is an [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] pattern between two [[sound]]s of slightly different [[frequency|frequencies]], ''perceived'' as a periodic variation in [[amplitude (music)|volume]] whose rate is the [[Difference (mathematics)|difference]] of the two frequencies.

When [[Musical tuning|tuning]] instruments that can produce sustained tones, beats can be readily recognized. Tuning two tones to a [[unison]] will present a peculiar effect: when the two tones are close in pitch but not identical, the difference in frequency generates the beating. The volume varies like in a [[tremolo]] as the sounds alternately interfere constructively and destructively. As the two tones gradually approach unison, the beating slows down and may become so slow as to be imperceptible. As the two tones get further apart, their beat frequency starts to approach the range of human pitch perception&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=This is Your Brain on Music: The Science of a Human Obsession|last=Levitin|first=Daniel|publisher=Penguin|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the beating starts to sound like a note, and a [[combination tone]] is produced. This combination tone can also be referred to as a [[missing fundamental]], as the beat frequency of any two tones is equivalent to the frequency of their implied fundamental frequency.

==Mathematics and physics of beat tones==
[[File:WaveInterference.gif|thumb|The sum (blue) of two sine waves (red, green) is shown as one of the waves increases in frequency. The two waves are initially identical, then the frequency of the green wave is gradually increased by 25%. Constructive and destructive interference can be seen.]]

This phenomenon is best known in acoustics or music, though it can be found in any linear system: "According to the [[superposition principle|law of superposition]], two tones sounding simultaneously are superimposed in a very simple way: one adds their amplitudes".&lt;ref&gt;Winckel, Fritz (1967). ''Music, Sound and Sensation: A Modern Exposition'', p.134. Courier. {{ISBN|9780486165820}}.&lt;/ref&gt; If a graph is drawn to show the [[Function (mathematics)|function]] corresponding to the total sound of two [[strings (music)|strings]], it can be seen that maxima and minima are no longer constant as when a pure note is played, but change over time: when the two waves are nearly 180 degrees [[out of phase]] the maxima of one wave cancel the minima of the other, whereas when they are nearly in phase their maxima sum up, raising the perceived volume.

It can be proven (see [[List of trigonometric identities]]) that the [[envelope (waves)|envelope]] of the maxima and minima form a wave whose frequency is half the difference between the frequencies of the two original waves. Consider two [[sine wave]]s of unit [[amplitude]]:&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.animations.physics.unsw.edu.au/jw/beats.htm Interference beats and Tartini tones]", ''Physclips, UNSW.edu.au''.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;{ \cos(2\pi f_1t)+\cos(2\pi f_2t) } = { 2\cos\left(2\pi\frac{f_1+f_2}{2}t\right)\cos\left(2\pi\frac{f_1-f_2}{2}t\right) }&lt;/math&gt;

If the two original frequencies are quite close (for example, a difference of approximately twelve [[hertz]]&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/musFAQ.html#Tartini Acoustics FAQ]", ''UNSW.edu.au''.&lt;/ref&gt;), the frequency of the cosine of the right side of the expression above, that is {{sfrac|''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − ''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|2}}, is often too low to be perceived as an audible tone or [[pitch (music)|pitch]]. Instead, it is perceived as a periodic variation in the amplitude of the first term in the expression above. It can be said that the lower frequency cosine term is an ''envelope'' for the higher frequency one, i.e. that its amplitude is modulated. The frequency of the modulation is {{sfrac|''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|2}}, that is, the [[average]] of the two frequencies.  It can be noted that every second burst in the modulation pattern is inverted. Each peak is replaced by a trough and vice versa. However, because the human ear is not sensitive to the phase of a sound, only its amplitude or intensity, only the magnitude of the envelope is heard. Therefore, subjectively, the frequency of the envelope seems to have twice the frequency of the modulating cosine, which means the '''audible''' beat frequency is:&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Gareth E. (2016). ''From Music to Mathematics: Exploring the Connections'', p.112. JHU. 9781421419190.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;f_\text{beat}=f_1-f_2\,&lt;/math&gt;

This can be seen on the adjacent diagram.
[[Image:Beat.png|thumbnail|[[File:Beat - superposition of 104hz and 110hz sine waves.ogg]]
A 110&amp;nbsp;Hz A sine wave (magenta; first 2 seconds), a 104&amp;nbsp;Hz G{{music|sharp}} sine wave (cyan; following 2 seconds), their sum (blue; final 2 seconds) and the corresponding envelope (red)]]

A physical interpretation is that when
:&lt;math&gt;\cos\left(2\pi\frac{f_1-f_2}{2}t\right) = 1&lt;/math&gt;
the two waves are in phase and they [[Interference (wave propagation)|interfere]] constructively. When it is zero, they are out of phase and interfere destructively. Beats occur also in more complex sounds, or in sounds of different volumes, though calculating them mathematically is not so easy.

Beating can also be heard between notes that are near to, but not exactly, a [[harmony|harmonic]] [[interval (music)|interval]], due to some [[harmonic]] of the first note beating with a harmonic of the second note. For example, in the case of perfect fifth, the third harmonic (i.e. second overtone) of the bass note beats with the second harmonic (first overtone) of the other note. As well as with out-of tune notes, this can also happen with some correctly tuned [[equal temperament]] intervals, because of the differences between them and the corresponding [[just intonation]] intervals: see [[Harmonic series (music)#Harmonics and tuning]].

== Binaural beats ==
[[File:Binaural beats.svg|thumb|Binaural beats]]
[[File:Binaural beat lossless new.wav|thumb|right|To experience the binaural beats perception, it is best to listen to this file with [[headphones]] on moderate to weak volume – the sound should be easily heard, but not loud. Note that the sound appears to pulsate only when heard through both earphones. Time duration of 10 seconds]]
[[File:Pure Alpha Waves 7 to 12,9 Hz Binaural Beats V3.wav|thumb|Binaural Beats Base tone 200 Hz, beat frequency from 7 Hz to 12.9 Hz. Time duration of 9 minutes.]]

A binaural beat is an [[auditory illusion]] [[Perception|perceived]] when two different pure-tone [[sine wave]]s, both with [[Frequency|frequencies]] lower than 1500&amp;nbsp;Hz, with less than a 40&amp;nbsp;Hz difference between them, are presented to a [[Hearing|listener]] dichotically (one through each [[ear]]).

For example, if a 530&amp;nbsp;Hz pure [[Pitch (music)|tone]] is presented to a subject's right ear, while a 520&amp;nbsp;Hz pure tone is presented to the subject's left ear, the listener will perceive the [[auditory illusion]] of a third tone, in addition to the two pure-tones presented to each ear. The third sound is called a binaural beat, and in this example would have a perceived pitch correlating to a frequency of 10&amp;nbsp;Hz, that being the difference between the 530&amp;nbsp;Hz and 520&amp;nbsp;Hz pure tones presented to each ear.

Binaural-beat perception originates in the [[inferior colliculus]] of the [[midbrain]] and the [[superior olivary complex]] of the [[brainstem]], where [[Audio signal processing|auditory signals]] from each [[ear]] are integrated and precipitate [[Action potential|electrical impulses]] along [[neural pathway]]s through the [[reticular formation]] up the midbrain to the [[thalamus]], [[auditory cortex]], and other cortical regions.&lt;ref name=oster&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oster|first1=G|title=Auditory beats in the brain|journal=Scientific American|date=October 1973|volume=229|issue=4|pages=94–102|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1073-94|pmid=4727697|bibcode = 1973SciAm.229d..94O }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Musicians commonly use interference beats objectively to check [[Musical tuning|tuning]] at the [[unison]], [[perfect fifth]], or other simple harmonic intervals.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Murray; Greated, Clive A.; and Myers, Arnold (2004). ''Musical Instruments: History, Technology, and Performance of Instruments of Western Music'', p.26. Oxford. {{ISBN|9780198165040}}. "Listening for beats can be a useful method of tuning a unison, for example between two strings on a lute,..."&lt;/ref&gt; Piano and [[Organ (music)|organ]] tuners even use a method involving counting beats, aiming at a particular number for a specific interval.

The [[composer]] [[Alvin Lucier]] has written many pieces that feature interference beats as their main focus. Italian composer [[Giacinto Scelsi]], whose style is grounded on microtonal oscillations of unisons, extensively explored the textural effects of interference beats, particularly in his late works such as the violin solos ''Xnoybis'' (1964) and ''L'âme ailée / L'âme ouverte'' (1973), which feature them prominently (note that Scelsi treated and notated each string of the instrument as a separate part, so that his violin solos are effectively quartets of one-strings, where different strings of the violin may be simultaneously playing the same note with microtonal shifts, so that the interference patterns are generated). Composer [[Phill Niblock]]'s music is entirely based on beating caused by microtonal differences.

A '''concept-driven strategy''' is a process for formulating [[strategy]] that draws on the explanation of how humans inquire provided by linguistic pragmatic philosophy. This argues that thinking starts by selecting (explicitly or implicitly) a set of [[concept]]s (frames, patterns, lens, principles, etc.) gained from our past experiences. These are used to reflect on whatever happens, or is done, in the future.&lt;ref&gt;James, W. 1911/1996. Some Problems of Philosophy. University of Nebraska Press Nebraska.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concept-driven strategy therefore starts from agreeing and enacting a set of strategic concepts ([[organizing principle]]s) that "works best" for an organisation. For example, a hospital might set its strategy as intending to be Caring, World Class, Local, Evidence Based, and Team Based. A University might set its strategy as intending to be Ranked, Problem Solving, Online, Equis, and Offering Pathways. A commercial corporation might set its strategy as intending to be Innovative, Global, Have Visible Supply Chains, Agile and Market Share Dominant. These strategic concepts make up its ''Statement of Intent'' (or Purpose).

==Background==

Much of the [[strategic management]] literature mutates [[Peter Drucker]]'s call for corporations to start the strategic management process by producing a statement of purpose, mission and objectives. This has been mutated into a call to start with a vision, mission and objectives statement. There is an alternative approach which focuses on the Statement of Purpose or Intent. Drucker's example for this statement for a commercial corporation was to state that the corporation's purpose was to create customers. That is, it was going to use the concept of 'customer creation' to coordinate and organise the cognition or mindset of those that worked for the organisation. This was why the corporation existed. Having one concept is now thought to be insufficient. [[George Armitage Miller]]'s modified [[The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two]] and [[dialectic]] suggests a handful of concepts under tension would be preferable.

The Statement of Purpose, Statement of Intent or concept-driven approach to strategy formulation therefore focuses on setting and enacting a set strategic concepts. If a participatory approach is being used these concepts will be acquired through a process of collaboration with stakeholders. Once agreed the strategic concepts can be used to coordinate activities and act as a set of [[decision making]] criteria. The set of concepts that make up the Statement of Intent is then used to make sense of an unpredictable future across an organisation in a co-ordinated manner.&lt;ref&gt;Metcalfe M. A Pragmatic System of Decision Criteria Systems Research and Behavioral Science 2012 {{DOI|10.1002/sres.2122}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.ijproman.2012.12.006 | volume=31 | title=The linguistic turn in project conceptualization | year=2013 | journal=International Journal of Project Management | pages=1154–1162 | author=McKenna Allen, Metcalfe Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Underlying philosophy==

Linguistic [[pragmatism]] argues that our prior conceptions interpret our perception (sensory inputs). These conceptions are represented by concepts like running, smiling, justice, reasoning and agility. They are patterns of activity, experienced in our past and remembered. They can be named by those with language and so shared.&lt;ref&gt;Rorty, R. 1982. Consequences of Pragmatism. University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schon, D.A. 1963. Displacement of Concepts. Tavistock Publications, London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shields, P. 2005. Classical Pragmatism does not need an Upgrade. Administration &amp; Society 37(4) 504-518&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brandom, R., B,. 2011. Perspectives On Pragmatism. Havard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haack, S. 2006. Pragmatism: Old and New. Prometheus Books, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Toulmin, S. 1972. Human Understanding: The Collective Use and Evolution of Concepts. Princeton University Press, Princeton New Jersey.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bagginni explains pragmatic concepts using the classic example of whether the earth is flat or round.&lt;ref&gt;Baggini, J. 2005. Pragmatism History Of Ideas. BBC Radio 4, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"...if we treat the world as if these concepts do exist then we find we can manipulate the world and make things work much better. The point about this is that you cannot just choose any concept. What is useful is not just on our whim to choose. [A concept is] a better concept for looking at the world because it works much better than others. You don't have to worry, as some British philosophers have thought that if you go down the pragmatic route that you might believe the world is flat because [that fits best with our sensory input]. Ultimately it isn't useful to believe that the world is flat. All sorts of things won't work if you construct your view in that way. These concepts are tools for helping us manipulate the world and some work better than others."|Julian Baggini, (aired 2005) Editor of The Philosophers' Magazine.}}

Another example would be that we can think of the war in Iraqi differently by reflecting off the concepts of oil security, Imperialism, aggressive capitalism, liberation or democracy. 
The concept-driven approach to strategy formulation involves setting and using a set of linguistic pragmatic concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Metcalfe M  Pragmatic inquiry Journal of the Operational Research Society (2008) 59&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method ==

The steps to formulating a participatory concept-driven strategy are:

# Select who the strategy is for exactly, and what exactly is their problem. 
# Reflect on significant events in the past that have impacted on the organisation (past [[experience]] matters)
# Identify all stakeholders including suppliers, competitors, staff, alliances, government, environmentalist, industry experts, etc. 
# Ask them what concerns they have for the future relevant to your organisation. Use their experiences and expertise from being involved in the industry.  
# Use [[idea networking]] to cluster these stakeholder concern statements into about five clusters
# Name these clusters as strategic concepts (priorities, [[organizing principle]]s). For example, one cluster of statements might be about innovation, another about becoming more international. 
# Reflect on the possible paradoxical consequences of enacting these strategic concepts
# Draft a one-page 'Statement of Intent' which says the organisation intends to become more like the five or so strategic concepts.
# Draft implementation action plans for each strategic concept. These should be both organisational change actions and investment projects, with goals and milestones. 
# Communicate the 'Statement of Intent' and 'Action Plans' to stakeholders as appropriate.
# Get senior staffs' comments, performance measures, selection criteria and decision criteria to reflect the 'Statement of Intent'.
# In the longer term, reflect on the strategic concepts in the Statement of Intent.&lt;ref&gt;Blog on Concept Driven Strategy http://mudmap.wordpress.com/tag/concept-driven-strategy/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other terminology==
Concept-driven strategy is the name given to a number of similar [[strategic thinking]] approaches.

Generally, the term 'concept-driven' is used to encourage a focus on the 'concepts' being used.&lt;ref&gt;Mareschal, D., P. Quinn, S. Lea. 2010. The Making of Human Concepts. Oxford University Press, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, M.L.G., B.R. Gaines. 1989. Comparing Conceptual Structures: Consensus, Conflict, Correspondence and Contrast. Knowledge Acquisition 1 341-363.&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Concept learning]] or Management Concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Management Concepts Wikibooks http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Management_Concepts_and_Applications/Management&lt;/ref&gt;

Some organisations produce a 'statement of intent' with little thought as to the concepts it contains.&lt;ref&gt;Hamel, G., C.K. Prahalad. 2005. Strategic Intent. Harvard Business Review 83(7/8) 148-161.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katada, T. 1994. Strategic Intent to Corporate Purpose: The Remaking of Komatsu. Harvard Business Review 72(6) 83-.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Saku M., Sillance J.A.A. | year = 2007 | title = Strategic Intent as a Rhetorical Device | url = | journal = Scandinavian Journal of Management | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 406–423 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katada, T. 1994. Strategic Intent to Corporate Purpose: The Remaking of Komatsu. Harvard Business Review 72(6) 83-.&lt;/ref&gt; However, if it is a short list of concepts, high level objectives, principles, priorities or frames, then concept-driven strategy offers a philosophical basis for these statements.

Some organisations produce a 'strategic principles'&lt;ref&gt;Strategic Principals http://disruptit.wordpress.com/2007/12/01/difference-between-strategic-principle-and-mission-statement/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The difference-between-strategic-principle-and-mission-statement http://disruptit.wordpress.com/2007/12/01/difference-between-strategic-principle-and-mission-statement/ Strategic Principals&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;How to Turn a Great Strategic Principle into Great Results http://www.strategydriven.com/2011/06/27/how-to-turn-a-great-strategic-principle-into-great-results/&lt;/ref&gt; statement which again is similar to a statement of intent and the same applies about the concepts approach offering a philosophical basis. The term 'strategic priorities' or 'strategic values' are often used in the same way as strategic principles.

The literature about 'corporate purpose'&lt;ref&gt;Basu, S. 1999. Corporate Purpose: Why it Matters More than Strategy. Garland Publishing, Inc, New York &amp; London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellsworth, R., R. 2002. Leading with Purpose. Stanford University Press, California.&lt;/ref&gt; is also similar to that of strategic intent. Sometimes, purpose refers to present actions and intent to future ones. If purpose is expressed as a set of concepts, then the concepts approach again provides some philosophical basis.

There is a connection between '[[systems thinking]]'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ackoff R | year = 1971 | title = Towards A System Of System Concepts | url = | journal = Management Science | volume = 17 | issue = 11| pages = 661–671 | doi=10.1287/mnsc.17.11.661}}&lt;/ref&gt; and concept-driven strategy. The Churchman/Ackoff stream of systems thinking was interested in a developing generic system of concepts for thinking about problems. Rather than a generic set of concepts, the concept-driven approach uses whatever concepts stakeholders think work best for the future of their organisation.

There is a military planning approach called 'concept-led'.&lt;ref&gt;The Role of OR and Analysis in Concept-led Long Range Planning http://www.dsto.defence.gov.au/publications/2535/DSTO-CR-0282.pdf{{Dead link|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On the implementation of 'Concept-led and Participative' planning in the development of the Defence Logistics Transformation Plan http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/4367990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Headline Experiment a concept-led team effort http://adamdonovan.net/pdf/adam%20defence%20mag.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The military-like leadership seems to have moved the concepts from being drivers to be leaders. There seems to be very little difference otherwise.

In turbulent environments, concepts are thought 'more flexible than objectives' (goals, targets) as they provide why certain actions are preferable. The purpose and intent literature likes to distinguish itself from the objectives literature by saying purpose and intent provide the reasons for (why change), the driver for change. Objectives are where you end up. In complex dynamic situations, there may be many acceptable end points, many of which cannot be anticipated by planners. Arguably the only objective is to survive. How is explained in the statement of intent.

Perhaps strangely, there is a connection between 'metaphor', [[metaphoric criticism]], or [[conceptual metaphor]] and concept-driven strategy. Pragmatic concepts are not images but most concepts relate to metaphors. For example, to say an organisation is like a machine, with cogs, or like an adaptive organism, is to use the concepts of machine and organism to reflect on organisations. Much of what has been written about the usefulness of metaphors in planning applies to concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Schon, D.A. 1963. Displacement of Concepts. Tavistock Publications, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term 'strategic frames' is not common given the extensive literature on [[frame analysis]] but frames and pragmatic concepts seem to be very similar. [[Amos Tversky]] defines a frame as a conception of outcomes.

The system of strategic concepts listed in a statement of intent, purpose, principles, frames or conceptual metaphor are [[organizing principle]](s).&lt;ref&gt;Vnuk-Balan, E. 2010. Concept Driven Strategy, American Academy of Management Conference, Toronto.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, as Karl Weick explains [[sensemaking]] as the process of conceptualising problems, concept-driven strategy might be thought of as a pragmatic means of sensemaking a strategy.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==Background==

===Creative Visualization and New Age Popularity===

The use of the term 'Creative Visualization' to denote the practice of visualizing [[idealism|idealized]] autobiographical [[mental image]]ry indicative of [[Human body|physical]], [[Mind|psychological]], [[Social relation|social]], and [[Money|financial]] goals has remained one of many [[self-realization]] or [[self-actualization]] pursuits characteristic of [[popular psychology]] and the [[New Age]] since the [[personal development]] author [[Shakti Gawain]] published a book entitled ''Creative Visualization'' in 1978.&lt;ref name="Gawain, S. 2002"&gt;Gawain, S., Creative visualization. New World Library, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rindfleish, J. 2005, pp343-360"&gt;Rindfleish, J., Consuming the self: New Age spirituality as “social product” in consumer society. Consumption, Markets and Culture, Vol. 8, No. 4, 2005, pp343-360.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first line of the book reads "Creative Visualization is the technique of creating what you want in your life". The following opening paragraphs define [[imagination]] as the "creative energy of the universe", and introduces the book as a means by which to use the so-defined imagination to "create what you ''truly'' want - love, fulfillment, enjoyment, satisfying relationships, rewarding work, self-expression, health, beauty, prosperity, inner peace, and harmony."&lt;ref name="Gawain, S. 2002"/&gt;

===Nineteenth Century Origins in New Thought===

[[Shakti Gawain|Gawain's]] book popularized a [[premise]] derived from the [[New Thought]] movement that began during the nineteenth century, primarily in the United States and the United Kingdom. The [[premise]] is that individuals have a [[mind]] containing mental content, including [[thought]]s, [[Mental image|images]], [[Memory|memories]], and [[prediction]]s, which become manifested through the experience of living.&lt;ref name="Dresser, H. W. 1919"&gt;Dresser, H. W., A History of the New Thought Movement, TY Crowell Co. 1919.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Claims and Hypotheses==
According to advocates of [[New Thought]], [[Disease#Terminology|physical sickness]] and [[Mental disorder|mental illness]], as well as unfortunate circumstances, are the consequence of such [[Mind|mental content]]. Furthermore, they allege that when an individual controls, modifies, and regulates his or her [[mind]] and [[Cognition|mental content]], then material life and the experience of living alters accordingly, healing [[Illness|physical sickness]], [[disability]] and [[psychological pain]], and transforming [[Extreme poverty|destitution]], [[indenture]], and [[Unhappiness|misery]] into [[wealth]], [[autonomy]], and [[happiness]].&lt;ref name="Dresser, H. W. 1919"/&gt;

[[Shakti Gawain|Gawain's]] book focuses primarily on making changes to [[Visual perception|visual]] [[mental image]]ry, and attributes to it the capacity for hindering or facilitating an individual's [[Aptitude|potential]], citing [[Misleading vividness|vivid]] [[Anecdotal evidence|anecdotal]] [[Narrative|stories]] drawn from her experience and that of others to support her thesis.&lt;ref name="Gawain, S. 2002"/&gt;

Subsequent to the popularity of the book, the practice of '''Creative Visualization''', as described by [[Shakti Gawain|Gawain]], remained a staple and stable feature within the [[New Age]] movement, [[self-help]] media, and [[popular psychology]] of the 1980s, 1990s, and first decade of the 21st century.&lt;ref name="Rindfleish, J. 2005, pp343-360"/&gt;

==Universal Energy in Eastern Cultures==

The belief in a universal [[Energy (esotericism)|life force]] or energy was and remains common to diverse ancient traditions, where it is variously named [[Qi]] or [[Qi|Ch'i]] in Chinese culture, (Traditional Chinese: 氣), (Simplified Chinese: 气),&lt;ref&gt;
Ho, P. Y.,  Li, Qi, and Shu: An Introduction to Science and Civilization in China. Dover Publications, 2000.
&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Prana]] (Sanskrit: प्राण) in [[India]]n [[Hindu |Hindu-based]] [[Philosophy|philosophies]], [[religion]], and [[Cosmology|cosmologies]],&lt;ref&gt;Vimal, R. L. P., Introducing Dual-Aspect Monism (modified-Vishishtadvaita) Framework in Religion: Prana Pratistha. Vision Research Institute: Living Vision and Consciousness Research, Vol. 4, No. 3, 2011, pp1-50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
i Llimona, R. E., Intuition, inspiration and prana. Contributions to science, Vols. 1-2, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and thereby was not an original concept formulated by [[Shakti Gawain|Gawain]].

==Creative Visualization and Universal Energy in the 21st Century==

The claim that [[thought]]s and [[Mental image|visual mental images]] are composed of a [[Energy (esotericism)|universal energy]] described by Gawain in 1978 as the "creative energy of the universe", which can be brought under volitional control by '''Creative Visualization''' was amplified and exaggerated twenty-eight years later by the author and television producer, [[Rhonda Byrne]].

In 2006, [[Rhonda Byrne|Byrne]] made a film called [[The Secret (2006 film)|'The Secret']],&lt;ref name="The Secret 2006"&gt;The Secret, TS Production LLC. DVD Release Date: October 1, 2006. ASIN: B000K8LV1O.&lt;/ref&gt; and compiled a subsequent [[The Secret (book)|book]] of the same name,&lt;ref&gt;
Byrne, R., The secret. Simon and Schuster, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; which made significant claims for the potential human use of such an energy, and popularized a [[Maxim (philosophy)|maxim]] called the [[Law of attraction (New Thought)|'Law of Attraction']], originally proposed in 1906 by [[New Thought]] author [[William Walker Atkinson]], in his book ''Thought Vibration or the Law of Attraction in the Thought World''.&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson, W. W., Thought Vibration or the Law of Attraction in the Thought World. Cornerstone, 1906.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chabris, C. F., and Simon, D. J., Fight ‘The Power. New York Times, 24 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rhonda Byrne|Byrne's]] [[The Secret (book)|book]] and [[The Secret (2006 film)|film]] ''The Secret'', and its rendition of the 'Law of Attraction', asserted three claims. Firstly, that thoughts and other [[Mind|mental content]], such as [[Visual perception|visual]] [[Mental image|imagery]], is composed of '[[Energy (esotericism)|pure energy]]'. Secondly, that this is the same [[Energy (esotericism)|energy]] that permeates everyone, everything, and brings order to the [[universe]]. Thirdly, that this [[Energy (esotericism)|energy]] obeys the principle of 'like attracts like', such that if you [[Thought|think]] negative thoughts, or visualize unpleasant or undesirable [[Mental image|images]], the energy of which those thoughts and images are allegedly made will attract the material manifestation of what you think and visualize.&lt;ref name="The Secret 2006"/&gt;

According to advocates of this [[Maxim (philosophy)|maxim]], including [[Bob Proctor]], [[Neale Donald Walsch]], and [[Jack Canfield]], it is also logically reversible, such that negative or undesirable circumstances are to be interpreted as the [[Causality|causal]] outcome of negative [[thought]]s and [[Mental image|images]].

&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of positive thinking has far-reaching implications in many arenas making it a dangerous ideology to promote. By simply thinking positively, people can “cure” themselves of physical diseases, such as cancer, and will often refuse medical intervention on such grounds. &lt;ref&gt;Stanovich, K.E. (2013). How to think straight about psychology. Toronto: Pearson Education.&lt;/ref&gt; After The Secret aired on Oprah Winfrey, for example, a woman by the name of Kim Tinkham wrote a letter to Oprah telling her that she would be using positive mental imagery to fight against her breast-cancer diagnosis. &lt;ref&gt;Stanovich, K. E. (2013). How to think straight about psychology. Toronto: Pearson Education.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to believe in the power of positive thinking to cure oneself of illness or improve one’s life circumstances requires that we sacrifice rational thought as it goes against everything we know about the way the world works. &lt;ref&gt;Salerno, S. (2009). Positively misguided: The myths and mistakes of the Positive Thinking Movement. ''Skeptic, 14''(4), 30-37.''''&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of promoting the positive thinking movement results in lives lost as people begin to refuse medical treatments in favour of “curing” themselves. 
There are other costs as well. For example, businesses that refuse to acknowledge any problems with their business strategies because it is seen as being too pessimistic. &lt;ref&gt;Salerno, S. (2009). Positively misguided: The myths and mistakes of the Positive Thinking Movement. ''Skeptic, 14''(4), 30-37.''''&lt;/ref&gt; The person who does point out the flaws in business strategies is labelled as being all doom-and-gloom and an inadequate team player. In politics, it is also problematic because many campaigns and policy changes are promoted through the politicians’ sheer belief that a given policy or platform will be effective, rather than on the soundness of the policy itself. &lt;ref&gt;Salerno, S. (2009). Positively misguided: The myths and mistakes of the Positive Thinking Movement. ''Skpetic, 14''(4), 30-37.''''&lt;/ref&gt;
The problems the positive thinking movement has brought upon the education system absolutely must be addressed. The influence of the positive thinking movement can be seen in the move towards an education system that values boosting self-esteem over educational accomplishment. &lt;ref&gt;Salerno, S. (2009). Positively misguided: The myths and mistakes of the Positive Thinking Movement. ''Skeptic, 14''(4), 30-37.''''&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea was that boosting self-esteem would lead to high academic achievement, but all that has happened is that we focus exclusively on boosting self-esteem to the detriment of education attainment. Teachers cannot fail children so they are being passed through every grade regardless of their performance or how much knowledge they have demonstrated, and can pass in assignments whenever it so pleases them. &lt;ref&gt;Salerno, S. (2009). Positively misguided: The myths and mistakes of the Positive Thinking Movement. ''Skeptic, 14''(4), 30-37.''''&lt;/ref&gt;  Such an educational system, which has been influenced by the positive thinking movement, is detrimental to society as a whole because it produces entitled kids who have no sense of responsibility, hard work, or accountability and likely will not be the kind of citizens who will contribute in a meaningful way to society. Furthermore, such children will find it difficult to succeed in a work environment where qualities such as responsibility, hard work, and accountability are still highly valued.

'''Daniel Callus''' (1888–1965) was a Maltese [[historian]] and [[philosopher]]. His main interest was in the history of [[History of philosophy#Medieval philosophy|Medieval philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Montebello, ''Il-Ktieb tal-Filosofija f’Malta'' (''A Source Book of Philosophy in Malta''), PIN Publications, Malta, 2001, Vol. I, pp. 64-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

===Beginnings===
Callus was born at [[Żebbuġ, Malta]], on January 20, 1888.&lt;ref&gt;Biographical data from ''Daniel Callus: Historian &amp; Philosopher'' (1994) by Mark Montebello, Malta University Press, Malta, pp. 21-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formation===
Callus joined the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] in 1903 at 15 years of age, and studied with them at [[Rabat, Malta]] (1905–08). In 1906, after receiving his [[Minor Orders]], he was sent to [[Fiesole]], [[Italy]], to pursue his studies there. Four years later, in 1910, he obtained the degree of Lector in Theology and Philosophy from the [[University of Florence]]. At the same university Callus undertook studies in [[philosophy]], [[history of art]], and [[Semitic languages]].

In 1910 Callus was sent to [[Rome]] where he was ordained to the priesthood on November 6 and pursued postgraduate studies at the ''Angelicum'' in Rome, the future [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']].

In 1912 Callus was assigned to [[Rabat, Malta]] where he remained until 1921. At [[Rabat, Malta]], he was appointed Acting Regent of Studies of the [[Studium Generale]]. In 1914 he was also appointed Professor of [[Dogmatic Theology]] at the [[bishop]]’s major seminary at [[Mdina]], [[Malta]].

===Commitments===
In 1921 Callus went to [[England]] for two years. He settled at [[Hawkesyard Priory|Hawkesyard]], [[Staffordshire]] as Acting Regent of Studies. Here, he gave lectures and prepared the examination ''ad gradum'' for the [[Master of Sacred Theology]] degree which he obtained in 1924 at [[Rome]]’s [[Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas (Angelicum)|''Pontificium Collegium Internationale Angelicum'']], the future [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']], (the degree was officially conferred a year later). That same year, Callus was sent to [[Viterbo]], [[Italy]], as Regent of Studies. He stayed here just over a year.

On May 1, 1924, was honored with the title "Master of Sacred Theology" bestowed by Procurator General of the Dominican Order. He then returned to [[Malta]] and was appointed Professor of [[Bible|Holy Scripture]] and [[Hebrew]] at the [[University of Malta]] (1924). He was also appointed Regent of Studies at the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]]’ [[Studium Generale]] at [[Rabat, Malta]].

===At Oxford===
In 1931 Callus resigned from all of his offices in [[Malta]] and permanently left for [[Hawkesyard Priory|Hawkesyard]], and then, a year later, for [[Oxford]], [[England]], where he stayed until his death. Here he was engaged in predominantly academic and intellectual work. At first he became a research student, exercising himself further in [[paleography]]. Later, he became part of a group of distinguished scholars and intellectuals so as to study [[Medieval theology#High Scholasticism and its contemporaries|Medieval Theology]] and [[Medieval philosophy|Philosophy]]. Callus thus continued to mature his philosophical views and to extend his already wide horizon of knowledge. In 1938 he received the degree of [[Doctor of Philosophy]] being the first Dominican since the reformation to take a degree at Oxford. Two years later in 1940 he was appointed Regent of Studies at [[Blackfiars, Oxford]], an office he held for twelve years. That same year, the [[University of Malta]] awarded him the title of [[Emeritus]] [[Professor]]. In 1943 he was elected Member of the [[Medieval Academy of America]], and in 1946 he was elected Member of the Committee of the Medieval Latin Dictionary of the [[British Academy]]. A year later, in 1947, he was elected Fellow of the [[Royal Historical Society]], and the following year he became the first editor of ''Dominican Studies''. In 1953 the [[University of Oxford]] conferred upon him the degree of [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|Master of Arts]], and in that same year he was appointed Member of the Congregation of the [[University of Oxford]]. In 1962 he was also conferred the degree of Doctor of Literature ‘[[Honoris Causa]]’ by the [[University of Malta]].

===Death===
Callus traveled far and wide lecturing and addressing seminars and conferences on Medieval philosophers, and expounding his own philosophy. On March 25, 1965, he was in [[Malta]] celebrating his diamond jubilee as a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]]. A month later, while still in [[Malta]], he was taken ill, and died on May 26 at the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] hospital of St. Catherine’s in [[Attard]]. He was buried at the cemetery of [[Żebbuġ, Malta]], his birthplace, following an impressive funeral at the church of St. Dominic’s in [[Valletta]].

==Works==
According to scholarly analysis and criticism, Callus’ academic and intellectual endeavour is divided between his ‘Malta Period’ (1912–1931) and his ‘Oxford Period’. His publications from the first period, though interesting, are not of much interest to philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Classified in ''Daniel Callus: Historian &amp; Philosopher'', Mark Montebello, Malta University Press, Malta, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; His best scholarly contributions are all part of the latter period. They are not very numerous in number – just 40 contributions – but all of a very high calibre, both scientifically and, sometimes, philosophically. These works are generally distinguished under three main headings, as indicated hereunder:

===Sacra Scriptura===
These are contributions on themes related to Medieval texts and manuscripts linked to [[Bible|Holy Scripture]] or [[Biblical studies]].

* 1932 – La Comogonia Biblica secondo S. Agostino nel ‘De Genesi ad Litteram’ (The formation of the Bible according to St. Augustine in his ‘De Genesi ad Litteram’).&lt;ref&gt;''Settimana di Studi Agostiniani'', pp. 7-37.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1941 – The study of the Bible in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;''Blackfriars'', 22, pp. 664-674.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Varia===
These contributions deal with varied themes not classifiable under the other headings.

* 1933 – The XIX centenary of the redemption.&lt;ref&gt;''Blackfriars'', 14, pp. 400-406.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1934 – Il P. [[Bede Jarrett]] O.P. (Fr. Bede Jarrett O.P.)&lt;ref&gt;''Memorie Domenicane'', 51, pp. 229-234, 322-337.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1941 – A Socialist experiment in our time.&lt;ref&gt;''Irish Rosary'', 45, 91-95.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas d’Aquin conservè à la Cathedrale de La Valletta, Malta (An autographed fragment of St. Thomas Aquinas kept at the Valletta Cathedral in Malta).&lt;ref&gt;‘Appendice’ to D.M. Inguanez O.S.B., ''Archivum Fratrum Prædicatorum'', 26, pp. 353-356.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mediaevalia===
Callus’ ''forte'' was related to Medieval manuscripts, texts and documents. These contributions are general in nature (grouped under the first heading below), related to Oxford scholars, theologians and/or philosophers (the second heading) or associated to a particular Medieval philosophical question, the so-called "[[Substantial form|Unity of Forms]]" (third heading).

'''David Benatar''' (born 1966) is a South African philosopher, academic and author. He is best known for his advocacy of [[antinatalism]] in his book ''Better Never to Have Been: The Harm of Coming into Existence'', in which he argues that coming into existence is a serious harm, regardless of the feelings of the existing being once brought into existence, and that, as a consequence, it is always morally wrong to create more sentient beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Mark | last=Steyn| authorlink =Mark Steyn | title = Children?

== Early life and education ==
Benatar is the son of Solomon Benatar, a global-health expert who founded the Bioethics Centre at the University of Cape Town. Not much is known about Benatar's personal life as he deliberately guards his privacy. He has held antinatalist views since his childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/persons-of-interest/the-case-for-not-being-born|title=The Case for Not Being Born |last=Rothman |first=Joshua |date=27 November 2017 |website=The New Yorker |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic career ==
Benatar is professor of philosophy and head of the Department of Philosophy at the [[University of Cape Town]] in [[Cape Town]], South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophy.uct.ac.za/philosophy/staff/benatar University of Cape Town Philosophy Department Staff]&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Philosophical work ==
=== Pain ===
Benatar argues from the premise that pain is, in itself, a bad thing.{{sfn|Benatar|2006}} His work has often been associated with contemporary philosophies of nihilism and pessimism. Benatar has stated his lack of approval toward the [[Negative_utilitarianism#The_benevolent_world-exploder|benevolent world-exploder]] view.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0Q59w8CY0k&amp;t=2002s&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, he offers defenses of the [[corporal punishment]] of children{{sfn|Gert|Costa|Dancy|Benatar|1998}} and the [[circumcision]] of male infants (which he deems a matter for parental discretion).&lt;ref&gt;Michael Benatar, David Benatar, "Between Prophylaxis and Child Abuse: The Ethics of Neonatal Circumcision," in: David Benatar, ed., ''Cutting to the Core: Exploring the Ethics of Contested Surgeries'' (Lanham: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, 2006), pp. 23–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Asymmetry between pain and pleasure ===

Benatar argues there is an asymmetry between pleasure and pain, which means it would be better for humans not to have been alive:
# the presence of pain is bad;
# the presence of pleasure is good;
# the absence of pain is good, even if that good is not enjoyed by anyone;
# the absence of pleasure is not bad unless there is somebody for whom this absence is a deprivation.&lt;ref&gt;D. Benatar, ''Why it is Better Never to Come Into Existence'', ''American Philosophical Quarterly'' 1997, volume 34, number 3, pp. 345-355.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. Benatar, ''Better...'', op. cit., pp. 30-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

==== Implications for procreation ====
Benatar argues that bringing someone into existence generates both good and bad experiences, pain and pleasure, whereas not doing so generates neither pain nor pleasure. The absence of pain is good, the absence of pleasure is not bad. Therefore, the ethical choice is weighed in favor of non-procreation.

Benatar raises four other related asymmetries that he considers quite plausible:
# We have a moral obligation not to create unhappy people, and we have no moral obligation to create happy people. The reason why there is a moral obligation not to create unhappy people is that we believe the presence of pain is bad for those who are hurt, and the absence of pain is good also when there is no someone who is experiencing this good. By contrast, the reason for which there is no moral obligation to create happy people is that although the feeling of pleasure would be good for them, the absence of pleasure when they do not come into existence will not be bad, because there will be no one who will be deprived of this good.
# It is strange to mention the interests of a potential child as a reason why we decide to create it, and it is not strange to mention the interests of a potential child as a reason why we decide not to create it. That the child may be happy is not a morally important reason to create it. By contrast, that the child may be unhappy is an important moral reason to not create it. If the absence of pleasure is bad even if someone does not exist to experience its absence, we would have a significant moral reason to create a child, and to create as many children as possible. If, however, the absence of pain wouldn't be good even if someone would not experience this good, we would not have a significant moral reason not to create a child.
# Someday we can regret for the sake of the good of a man whose existence was conditional on our decision, that we created him {{ndash}} a man can be unhappy and the presence of his pain would be a bad thing. But we will never feel regret for the sake of the good of a man whose existence was conditional on our decision, that we did not create him {{ndash}} a man will not be deprived of happiness, because he will never exist, and the absence of happiness will not be bad, because there will be no one who will be deprived of this good. 
# We feel sadness about the fact that, somewhere, people came into existence and suffer, and we feel no sadness about the fact that, somewhere, people did not come into existence, and that in this place there are no happy people. When we know that, somewhere, people came into existence and suffer, we feel compassion. The fact that on some deserted island or planet, people did not come into existence and do not suffer is good. This is because the absence of pain is good even when there is no one experiencing this good. On the other hand, we do not feel sadness about the fact that on some deserted island or planet people did not come into existence and are not happy. This is because the absence of pleasure is bad only when there is someone who is deprived of this good.&lt;ref&gt;D. Benatar, ''Better...'', op. cit., pp. 30-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Humans' unreliable assessment of life's quality ===

Benatar raises the issue of whether humans inaccurately estimate the true quality of their lives, and has cited three psychological phenomena which he believes are responsible for this: 
# [[Pollyanna principle|Tendency towards optimism]]: we have a positively distorted perspective of our lives in the past, present, and future.
# Adaptation: we adapt to our circumstances, and if they worsen, our sense of well-being is lowered in anticipation of those harmful circumstances, according to our expectations, which are usually divorced from the reality of our circumstances. 
# Comparison: we judge our lives by comparing them to those of others, ignoring the negatives which affect everyone to focus on specific differences. And due to our optimism bias, we mostly compare ourselves to those worse off, to overestimate the value of our own well-being.

He concludes;''{{quote|The above psychological phenomena are unsurprising from an evolutionary perspective. They militate against suicide and in favour of reproduction. If our lives are quite as bad as I shall still suggest they are, and if people were prone to see this true quality of their lives for what it is, they might be much more inclined to kill themselves, or at least not to produce more such lives. Pessimism, then, tends not to be naturally selected.''&lt;ref&gt;D. Benatar, ''Better...'', op. cit., pp. 64-69.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Sexual discrimination against men and boys ===
Benatar's ''The Second Sexism: Discrimination Against Men and Boys'' (2012) has been met with controversy: The philosopher [[Simon Blackburn]] writes: "Benatar knows that such examples are likely to meet snorts of disbelief or derision, but he is careful to back up his claims with empirical data, and as a philosopher he is especially careful both about the interpretation of evidence and the use of terms such as "discrimination".&amp;nbsp;[...] I do not at all doubt that there is a case to be made for the recognition of a second sexism, nor that Benatar makes it well. And it is not as if he himself is taking sides in these invidious comparisons. He is not a participant in the sex wars but a peacemaker who wants them to wind down. All that he aims to show is that if it is all too often tough being a woman, it is also sometimes tough being a man, and that any failure to recognise this risks distorting what should be everyone's goal, namely universal sympathy as well as social justice for all, regardless of gender."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;storycode=420459&amp;c=1 ''Times Higher Education''] review, 5 July 2012, retrieved 27 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher Iddo Landau writes: "Benatar suggests that in order to cope with the hitherto ignored second sexism we should not only acknowledge it but also dedicate much more empirical and philosophical research to this under-explored topic and, of course, try to change many attitudes, social norms, and laws.&amp;nbsp;/ This is a very well-argued book that presents an unorthodox thesis and defends it ably. It would be a useful text in both undergraduate and graduate courses in philosophy and gender studies, where it is certain to arouse a lot of discussion, much of it excited. [...] Most importantly [...] it is likely to change our understanding of gender relations."&lt;ref&gt;[http://metapsychology.mentalhelp.net/poc/view_doc.php?type=book&amp;id=6608&amp;cn=135 ''Metapsychology'' online reviews], 21 August 2012, retrieved 27 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Suzanne Moore, a columnist for ''The Guardian'' and ''The Sunday Mail'', wrote: "...&amp;nbsp;abundant tripe trickles down from on high, even academe. Every so often a new tome details how men, not women, are discriminated against (apart from rape, murder, equal pay, genital mutilation, the power imbalance in politics, business, education, law and arts they may have a point). Things are tough for some guys. Really, I know that. I just find it hard to accept feminism has gone too far, that a bit of underarm hair signals the end of western civilisation."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/may/16/second-sexism-men-blaming-feminism ''The Guardian''], 16 May 2012, "The Second Sexism is just victim-envy", retrieved 27 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In a brief letter to ''The Guardian'', Benatar sought to correct some errors in Moore's account of his views; &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/may/18/men-and-sexism ''The Guardian''], 18 May 2012, "Men and sexism", retrieved 27 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Benatar had predicted criticisms in the book: "Given the prevailing orthodoxy in the academy and the sensitivity of the issues I shall be discussing, the views I defend in this book will be deemed threatening by many. I am under no illusions. My position, no matter how clearly stated, is likely to be misunderstood."{{sfn|Benatar|2012|p=16}}

== Publications ==
Benatar is the author of a series of widely-cited papers in [[medical ethics]], including "Between Prophylaxis and Child Abuse" (''[[The American Journal of Bioethics]]'') and "A Pain in the Fetus: Toward Ending Confusion about Fetal Pain" (''[[Bioethics (journal)|Bioethics]]'').{{sfn|Benatar|Benatar|2003}}{{sfn|Benatar|Benatar|2001}}. His work has been published in such journals as ''[[Ethics (journal)|Ethics]]'', ''[[Journal of Applied Philosophy]]'', ''[[Social Theory and Practice]]'', ''[[American Philosophical Quarterly]]'', ''[[QJM: An International Journal of Medicine]]'', ''[[Journal of Law and Religion]]'' and the ''[[British Medical Journal]]''.

== Cultural influence ==
[[Nic Pizzolatto]], creator and writer of ''[[True Detective (TV series)|True Detective]]'' has cited Benatar's ''Better Never to Have Been'' as an influence on the TV series (along with [[Ray Brassier]]'s ''Nihil Unbound'', [[Thomas Ligotti]]'s ''The Conspiracy Against the Human Race'', Jim Crawford's ''Confessions of an Antinatalist,'' and [[Eugene Thacker]]'s ''In The Dust of This Planet'').&lt;ref&gt;[https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/02/02/writer-nic-pizzolatto-on-thomas-ligotti-and-the-weird-secrets-of-true-detective/ "Writer Nic Pizzolatto on Thomas Ligotti and the Weird Secrets of True Detective."]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life==
Benatar is [[vegan]], and has taken part in debates on veganism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/TheSpeciesBarrier35Antinatal The Species Barrier, around 30 minutes in]&lt;/ref&gt; He has argued that humans are "responsible for the suffering and deaths of billions of other humans and non-human animals. If that level of destruction were caused by another species we would rapidly recommend that new members of that species not be brought into existence."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecritique.com/articles/we-are-creatures-that-should-not-exist-the-theory-of-anti-natalism] ''We Are Creatures That Should Not Exist: The Philosophy Of Anti-Natalism'', The Critique, July 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''doctrine of equivalents''' is a legal rule in many (but not all) of the world's [[patent]] systems that allows a [[court]] to hold a party liable for [[patent infringement]] even though the infringing device or process does not fall within the literal scope of a [[claim (patent)|patent claim]], but nevertheless is equivalent to the claimed [[invention]].  U.S. Judge [[Learned Hand]] has described its purpose as being "to temper unsparing logic and prevent an infringer from stealing the benefit of the invention".&lt;ref&gt;''Royal Typewriter Co. v. [[Remington Rand]], Inc.'', 168 F.2d 691, 692 (2d Cir. 1948).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standards for determining equivalents==

=== Germany ===
German courts typically apply a three-step test known as Schneidmesser's questions.&lt;ref&gt;Schneidmesser II; GRUR 2002, p 513. [[Federal Court of Justice of Germany]], March 12, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; These questions are:
#Does the variant solve the problem underlying the invention with means that objectively have the same effect?
#Would the [[person skilled in the art]], using the [[common general knowledge]], have realised at the [[Priority right|priority date]] that the variant has the same effect?
#Are the considerations which the skilled person takes into account for the variant in the light of the meaning of the invention close enough to the considerations taken into account for the literal solution protected by the claims, such that the skilled person will consider the variant as a solution which is equivalent to the literal one?

All of the above questions need to be answered in the affirmative in order to demonstrate equivalent infringement. In addition, an allegation of equivalent infringement needs to withstand the [[Formstein defence|Formstein test]].&lt;ref&gt;Schneidmesser II; GRUR 1986, p 803. [[Federal Court of Justice of Germany]], April 29, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; The corresponding question reads:
:Does the variant, having regard to the [[Prior art|state of the art]], lack [[Novelty (patent)|novelty]] or is the variant [[Inventive step and non-obviousness|obvious]] to a person skilled in the art?

=== Ireland ===

Ireland appears to subscribe to a doctrine of equivalents. In ''[[Farbwerke Hoechst v Intercontinental Pharmaceuticals (Eire) Ltd]]'' (1968), a case involving a patent of a chemical process, the High Court found that the defendant had infringed the plaintiff's patent despite the fact that the defendant had substituted the starting material specified in the patent claim for another material. Expert evidence showed that any technician who failed to obtain a good result using the specified starting material would try the replacement material. The two materials were therefore held to be chemically equivalent, and the replacement of one with the other by the defendant did not prevent a finding and injunction against him.

=== Switzerland ===
On 21 March 2013, the [[Federal Patent Court of Switzerland]] adopted an approach similar to the three-prong test applied in [[Germany]]. The court based its decision on the three questions:&lt;ref&gt;Kontrazeptiva; GRUR Int 2014, p 543. [[Federal Patent Court of Switzerland]], March 21, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Do the replaced features have the same objective function (same effect)? 
#Are the replaced features and their same objective function obvious to a [[person skilled in the art]] on the basis of the teaching of the patent (accessibility)? 
#After reading the wording of the claim in light of the description, would a [[person skilled in the art]] consider the replaced features as a solution of equal value (equal value)?

The court denied equivalent infringement of EP0918791B3, since paragraph 19 of EP0918791B3 explicitly teaches that toxic chromium compounds may be replaced by metallic catalysts. A person skilled in the art would not consider the organic catalyst TEMPO as a solution of equal value to the ruthenium salts specified in claim 1. The answer to the third question was negative.

The court also ruled that there was equivalent infringement of EP1149840B1, since all questions of the three-prong test were answered in the affirmative. The court set forth that the replacement of the claimed p-Toluenesulfonic acid with pyridine/water constituted basic knowledge taught during the first years of an undergraduate course in organic chemistry.

In ''Urinal valve II'',&lt;ref&gt;Patentverletzung durch Nachahmung; GRUR Int 1/2017, p 40. [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland|Federal Supreme Court]], October 3, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland]] basically affirmed the three-prong test applied by the Federal Patent Court. The Supreme Court still partly reversed the Federal Patent Court’s earlier ruling on case [https://www.bundespatentgericht.ch/fileadmin/entscheide/O2014_002_Teilurteil_2016-11-21.pdf O2014_002]. The Supreme Court contended (reasons 6.4) that a second embodiment of the urinal valve fully implemented the key teachings of the asserted patent EP1579133, even though the second embodiment was not literally covered by the wording of the relevant claim. The Court went on to establish equivalent infringement.

=== United Kingdom ===
As a signatory to the European Patent Convention (EPC), the UK is required to follow the Protocol on the Interpretation of Article 69 of the EPC, which requires member states to draw a balance between interpreting patent claims with strict literalism (with the description and drawings only helping resolve ambiguity) and regarding the claims as a mere guideline only.

The [[United Kingdom]] had historically never employed a doctrine of equivalents approach.  Instead, the UKIPO employed a [[purposive approach]] to assessing the scope of the claims, which applied to both patentability and infringement.  The latest UK case law on claim interpretation is found in '[[Improver Corp v Remington Consumer Products Ltd]]' (1990) and the [[House of Lords]] decision in 'Kirin-Amgen' (2004).  The so-called 'Improver' (or Protocol) questions found in the former are a widely used three-step test for deciding direct patent infringement.  

In July 2017, [[Lord Neuberger]] in ''Actavis UK v Eli Lilly'' introduced a new doctrine of equivalents test.  The Supreme Court set out three questions to consider when determining whether a patent infringed the claims as an equivalent:&lt;ref&gt;Actavis UK Ltd and others v Eli Lilly and Company [2017] UKSC 48. [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]], 12 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

# "Notwithstanding that it is not within the literal meaning of the relevant claim(s) of the patent, does the variant achieve substantially the same result in substantially the same way as the invention, ie the inventive concept revealed by the patent?"
# "Would it be obvious to the person skilled in the art, reading the patent at the priority date, but knowing that the variant achieves substantially the same result as the invention, that it does so in substantially the same way as the invention?"
# "Would such a reader of the patent have concluded that the patentee nonetheless intended that strict compliance with the literal meaning of the relevant claim(s) of the patent was an essential requirement of the invention?"

The first two questions must be answered in the affirmative, and the third question in the negative to demonstrate equivalent infringement.

=== United States ===
In the [[United States]], the doctrine of equivalents analysis is applied to individual claim limitations, not to the invention as a whole.&lt;ref name="Warner-Jenkinson Co."&gt;''See [[Warner-Jenkinson Co. v. Hilton Davis Chem. Co.|Warner-Jenkinson Co.]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  The legal test, articulated in ''[[Warner-Jenkinson Co. v. Hilton Davis Chem. Co.]]'' (1997), is whether the difference between the feature in the accused device and the limitation literally recited in the patent claim is "insubstantial."

One way of determining whether a difference is "insubstantial" or not is called the "triple identity" test.  Under the triple-identity test, the difference between the feature in the accused device and the limitation literally recited in the patent claim may be found to be "insubstantial" if the feature in the accused device:
#Performs substantially the same function
#In substantially the same way
#To obtain the same result
as the limitation literally recited in the patent claim.  See ''[[Graver Tank &amp; Manufacturing Co. v. Linde Air Products Co.]]'', (1950).

The Court also explained that the doctrine of equivalents applies if two elements are interchangeable and a person with ordinary skill in the art would have known that the elements were interchangeable at the time of infringement.&lt;ref name="Warner-Jenkinson Co."/&gt;

In the United States, the doctrine of equivalents is limited by [[prosecution history estoppel]].  Under prosecution history estoppel, if the patentee abandoned through an amendment to the patent application certain literal claim coverage (e.g., by narrowing the literal scope of the patent claim), then the patentee is estopped from later arguing that the surrendered coverage is insubstantially different from the literally claimed limitation.&lt;ref&gt;''See [[Festo Corp. v. Shoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabushiki Co.]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  The proposed equivalents also cannot cover, or ensnare, the prior art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20140611070955/http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/images/stories/opinions-orders/08-1240.pdf] ''Depuy Spine, Inc. v. Biedermann Motech GMBH'' (Fed. Cir. 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States also has a statutory equivalents doctrine that is codified in 35 U.S.C. § 112 ¶ 6, which extends to structural equivalents. However, while the general doctrine of equivalents extends to technological equivalents developed after the issuance of a claim, the statutory structural equivalents in 35 U.S.C. § 112 ¶ 6 extends only to equivalents available at issuance.{{primary source inline|date=August 2016}}

== Harmonization attempts ==
Attempts have been made to harmonize the doctrine of equivalents.

For instance, Article 21(2) of 1991 [[World Intellectual Property Organization|WIPO]]'s "Basic Proposal" for a Treaty Supplementing the [[Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property|Paris Convention]] states:
:"(a) (...) a claim shall be considered to cover not only all the elements as expressed in the claim but also equivalents.
:(b) An element ("the equivalent element") shall generally be considered as being equivalent to an element as expressed in a claim if, at the time of any alleged infringement, either of the following conditions is fulfilled in regard to the invention as claimed:
::(i) the equivalent element performs substantially the same function in substantially the same way and produces substantially the same result as the element as expressed in the claim, or
::(ii) it is obvious to a person skilled in the art that the same result as that achieved by means of the element as expressed in the claim can be achieved by means of the equivalent element."

The [[EPC 2000]], which came into effect on 13 December 2007, included an amended "Protocol on the interpretation of {{EPC Article|69}}" intended to bring about uniformity at a national level between contracting states to the EPC when interpreting claims.&lt;ref name="EPC2000"&gt;"An Overview of the New European Patent Convention and its Potential Impact on European Patent Practice", S.J. Farmer and M. Grund, Bio-Science Law Review, Vol. 9, Issue 2, pages 53-61&lt;/ref&gt; The amended text reads:
:''For the purpose of determining the extent of protection conferred by a European patent, due account shall be taken of any element which is an equivalent to an element specified in the claims.''
However, no definition of what was meant by an "equivalent" was included in the Protocol and it is expected that this lack of a binding definition will do little to achieve the desired uniform interpretation.&lt;ref name="EPC2000" /&gt;

'''Dvaitadvaita''' was proposed by [[Nimbarka]], a Vaishnava Philosopher who hailed from [[Coastal Andhra|Andhra]] Region. Nimbarka’s philosophical position is known as Dvaitadvaita ([[Bhedabheda]] vada). The categories of existence, according to him, are three, i.e., cit, acit, and [[Isvara]]. Cit and acit are different from Isvara, in the sense that they have attributes (Guna) and capacities (Swabhaava), which are different from those of Isvara. Isvara is independent and exists by Himself, while 'cit' and 'acit' have existence dependent upon Him. So, at the same time 'cit' and 'acit' are not different from [[Isvara]], because they cannot exist independently of Him. Here, difference means a kind of existence which is separate but dependent, (para-tantra-satta-bhava) while non-difference means impossibility of separate existence (svatantra-satta-bhava).

== Philosophical View ==
{{Vaishnavism}}
According to Nimbarka's Dvaitadvaita philosophy of differential [[monism]], various philosophical terms are understood as follows.

===Brahman===

The Highest Reality, according to [[Nimbarka]], is [[Brahman]], [[Krsna|Krishna]] or [[Hari]], a [[Svayam bhagavan|personal God]]. There is nothing that is equal to Him, nothing that is superior. He is the Lord of all, and Controller of all. He is called [[Brahman]] because of the unsurpassed greatness of His nature and qualities, because He is beyond any limit of any kind of space, time or thing.

[[Brahman]] is the sole cause of creation, maintenance and destruction of the Universe. All beings arise from Him, nothing is superior to Him. The Lord alone is the first cause, the manifestor of all names and forms, and none else.

This [[Brahman]] is both the upadana (material cause) and the Nimitta (efficient cause). It is the material cause in the sense that it enables its natural saktis, viz. the cit and the acit in their subtle forms, to be manifested in gross forms; and it is the efficient cause in the sense that it unites the individual souls with their respective fruits of actions and means of enjoyments.

[[Nimbarka]] discusses two aspects of Brahman. On one hand, Brahman is eternal and great, the greatest of the great, the highest of the high, the creator, etc. of the [[Universe]], high above the individual soul, of which He is the Lord and the ruler. But, on the other aspect He is the abode of infinite beauty, bliss and tenderness, and in intimate connection with the soul. He is the abode of supreme peace, supreme grace, and the ocean of all sweetness and charms.

Thus, [[Brahman]] possessed of attributes and adorable by all, has four forms or vyuhas (i.e., Vasudeva, Sankarsana, Pradyumna, and Aniruddha) and appears under various incarnation as Matsya, Kurma etc.

===Jiva (cit)===

The cit or individual soul is of the nature of knowledge (jnana-svarupa); it is able to know without the help of the sense-organs and it is in this sense that words like prajnana-ghanah svayamjyotih jnanamayah etc. as applied to jiva are to be understood. The jiva is the knower also; and he can be both knowledge and the possessor of knowledge at the same time, just as the sun is both light and the source of light. Thus the soul, who is knowledge, and his attribute, knowledge, though they are both identical as knowledge, can be at the same time different and related as the qualified (dharmin) and the quality (dharma), just as the sun and his light, though identical as light ([[taijasa]]), are still different from each other. Thus there is both a difference and a non-difference between the dharmin and dharma; and the extreme similarity between them implies, not necessarily their absolute identity, but only a non-perception of their difference.

The jiva is also ego (ahamarthah). This ego continues to persist not only in the state of deep sleep, (because our consciousness immediately after getting up from sleep has the form slept happily or knew nothing) but also in the state of liberation. It even belongs to the Parabrahman. Hence it is that [[Krishna]] refers to Himself so frequently in the first person in the Gita, of which the chief object is thus Purusottama, who is omniscient and at the same time non-different from the ego or asmadartha.

The jiva is also essentially active (kartr). This quality belongs to it in all its conditions, even after release. But the kartrtva is not independent. The jiva is also enjoyer (bhoktr) essentially in all its conditions.

For his knowledge and activity, however, the jiva depends on Hari; thus, though resembling Him in being intelligent and knower, he is at the same time distinguished from him by his dependence. This quality of dependence or of being controlled (niyamyatva) is the very nature of jiva even in the state of release, just as niyamyatva or the quality of being the controller, forms the eternal nature of Isvara.

The jiva is atomic in size; at the same time his attribute, knowledge, is omnipresent, which makes it possible that he can experience pleasure and pain in any part of the body, just as, for instance, the light of a lamp can spread far and wide and illumine objects away from the lamp. The Jivas are different and in different bodies, and so are infinite in number.

===Acit (the jagat)===

The acit is of three different kinds: viz. prakrta, aprakrta, and kala. Prakrta, or what is derived from Prakrti, the primal matter, aprakrta is defined negatively as that which is not the product of prakrti, but its real nature is not clearly brought out. These three categories in their subtle forms are as eternal as the cit or the individual souls.

[Nimbarka does not explain what exactly the aprakrta is, nor does he define kala more precisely, beyond noticing, as pointed out above,that the aprakrta and the kala are species of the acit. But, Purusottamacarya of the Nimbarka school has, in his Vedantaratna-manjusa, described acit aprakrta as the material cause of the dhama(celestial abode) of Brahman and the bodies and ornaments etc.of Brahman and his associates.]

Prakrti, or the primal matter-the stuff of the entire universe is real and eternal like the individual souls, and like them, though eternal and unborn, has yet Brahman for its cause. It consists of the three qualities of sattva, rajas and tamas, such as prakrit, mahat, ahankara etc. (just similar to 24 principles of the Sankhyas).

===Bondage===

The jiva has his true form distorted and obscured owing to his contact with karma resulting from ignorance, which is beginningless, but which can come to an end, by the grace of God, when its true nature is fully manifested. Ignorance is a part of God and is the basis of cosmic manifestation i.e. the arising of God with attributes.

===Mukti===

To attain deliverance, the jiva has to commence with a complete submission to the Paramatman, or prapatti, whose six constituents are:-

1) a resolution to yield (anukulasya samkalpah) 
2) the avoidance of opposition (pratikulasya varjanam) 
3) faith that God will protect (raksisyati ity visvasah) 
4) acceptance of him as saviour (goptrtva-varanam)
5) throwing one’s whole soul upon him (atmaniksepah), and 
6) a sense of helplessness (karpanya).

God’s grace extends itself to those who are possessed of these 6 constituents of prapatti, i.e., who are prapanna; and by that grace is generated bhakti consisting of special love for him, which ultimately ends in the realisation (saksatkara) of the Paramatman. For a devotee knowledge of the following 5 things is quite necessary:

1) the nature of the supreme soul, 
2) the nature of the individual soul, 
3) the fruit of God's grace or moksa, (which is an uninterrupted realisation of the nature and attributes of Brahman, following from the absolute destruction of all action and the consequent extinction of all sentience), 
4) the feeling of enjoyment consequent on bhakti, and 
5) the nature of the obstacles in the way of the attainment of God, such as regarding the body and the mind as the soul, depending on someone who is neither God nor the preceptor, neglecting their commands, and considering God as nothing more than an ordinary being.

==Four Sadhanas==
Sri Nimbarka refers to 4 methods of sadhanas:

===Karma===
Performed conscientiously in a proper spirit, with one’s varna and asrama thereby giving rise to knowledge which is a means to salvation).

===Vidya===
Not as a subordinate factor of karma but as an independent means.

===Upasana or dhyana===
It is of three types. First is meditation on the Lord as one's self, i.e. meditation on the Lord as the Inner Controller of the sentient. Second is meditation on the Lord as the Inner Controller of the non-sentient. Final one is meditation on Lord Himself, as different from the sentient and non-sentient.

===Gurupasatti===
Devotion and self-surrender to guru.

Sri Nimbarkacharya made the "Bhasya" of the Bramhasutra on His Dvaitadvaita Vedanta (Principle of Dualism-Nondualism) in his famous book "Vedanta Parijata Sourabha".

'''Ellen Sturgis Hooper''' (February 17, 1812 – November 3, 1848) was an American poet. A member of the [[Transcendental Club]], she was widely regarded as one of the most gifted poets among the [[New England]] [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalists]]. Her work is occasionally reprinted in [[anthology|anthologies]].

She was, besides, an acquaintance of [[William Ellery Channing]], [[Margaret Fuller]], [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], and [[Henry James, Sr.]]&lt;ref name="Five"&gt;Biographical Note in the [http://asteria.fivecolleges.edu/findaids/sophiasmith/mnsss112_bioghist.html Sturgis-Tappan Family Papers, 1812-1982], Five College Archives &amp; Manuscript Collection, retrieved 22 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Ellen Sturgis was born in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], the daughter of [[William F. Sturgis]] and Elizabeth M. Davis. Her father was a wealthy Boston merchant.&lt;ref name="Five"/&gt; Her mother was an intelligent and independent woman who spent much time away from her husband, inspiring in her daughter the idea to seek self-fulfillment.&lt;ref name=deRocher203&gt;de Rocher, Cecile Anne.

Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2003: 203. {{ISBN|0-313-32140-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1837, she married physician [[Robert William Hooper]], though her friends said they were not a good match because he was intellectually inferior. [[Margaret Fuller]], for example, said the match was like "perfume... wasted on the desert wind".&lt;ref name=deRocher203/&gt; The couple had three children, one of whom, [[Marian Hooper Adams|Marian "Clover" Hooper]], married [[Henry Brooks Adams|Henry Adams]] and became a celebrated Washington, D.C., hostess and photographer.

Her poetry was regularly commissioned by [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and published in ''[[The Dial]]''.&lt;ref name="Five"/&gt; Her poems also appeared in [[Elizabeth Peabody]]'s ''Æsthetic Papers'' (1849), and the final [[stanza]]s of one of her poems, ''The Wood-Fire'', appear in [[Henry David Thoreau]]'s ''[[Walden]]'' (1854).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alcott.net/alcott/home/champions/Hooper.html Ellen Sturgis Hooper, 1812–1848], Amos Bronson Alcott website&lt;/ref&gt;

Ellen Sturgis Hooper died of [[tuberculosis]] at age 36.&lt;ref name=deRocher203/&gt; Her early death is said to have "enshrined her in the memories of her associates as a Transcendental angel."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vcu.edu/engweb/transcendentalism/authors/hooper-pm.html Ellen Sturgis Hooper, 1812-1848], American Transcendentalism Web, Virginia Commonwealth University, retrieved 22 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Semiotics}}

'''Ethnosemiotics''' is a disciplinary perspective which links [[semiotics]] concepts to [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] methods.

==Definition==
[[Algirdas Julien Greimas]] and Joseph Courtés defined for the first time ethnosemiotics in ''[[Semiotics]] and language: an analytical dictionary''.

"Ethno-semiotics is not truly an autonomous semiotics. If it were, it would be in competition with a field of knowledge already established under the name of ethnology or anthropology, whose contribution to the advent of semiotics itself is considerable. Rather, it is a privileged area of curiosities and of methodological exercises ... . 
Given that general semiotics authorizes the treatment of non-linguistic (gestual, somatic, etc.) syntagmatic concatenations as discourses or texts, the field of ethno-linguistics can be enlarged to become an ethno-semiotics; analyses, still rare, of rituals and ceremonies lead us to suppose that ethnology can become, once again, the privileged locus for the construction of general models of signifying behavior."&lt;ref&gt;Algirdas Julien Greimas, Joseph Courtés Semiotics and language: an analytical dictionary Indiana University Press, 1982 - 409 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2000s, in Italy, the interest toward the discipline has been renewed thanks to the studies and the researches of Maurizio del Ninno, Tarcisio Lancioni, and Francesco Marsciani. Under the direction of Francesco Marsciani, in Bologna in 2007 the Ethnosemiotic Centre of the Bologna University (CUBE) was founded, active in different fields of inquiry. In 2015, CUBE's experience led to the series Quaderni di Etnosemiotica and the Ethnosemiotics lab.

==Focus and fields of inquiry==
The ethnosemiologist analyses the systems of signifiers which are individuated in specific cultural contexts through the observation and the application of the [[Ethnography|ethnographic methods]]. At the present, the principal researchers which have been realized are focused on urban spaces, therapy, rituals, folklore, everyday practices. 
In Italy we can distinguish two approaches to ethnosemiotics:

* the Urbin school, founded by Maurizio del Ninno, which follows the theoretical framework of [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] and [[Georges Dumézil]], close to French [[Social Anthropology]].
* the Bologna-Siena school, founded by Tarcisio Lancioni and Francesco Marsciani, which were concerned by the development of a set of concepts and methods to apply semiotic analysis to different aspects of everyday life.

From 2015 the Ethnosemiotics Lab leads researches both in the theoretical and the methodological field. Developed inside CUBE, active at the Bologna University, it conducts multidisciplinary researches. The synergy between ethnographic observation and the analysis of the manifested values offers active results from the point of view of the capacity to describe social phenomena.

The concept of the three great '''evolutionary faunas''' of marine animals from the [[Cambrian]] to the present (that is, the entire [[Phanerozoic]]) was introduced by [[Jack Sepkoski]] in 1981 using [[factor analysis]] of the fossil record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=J. J. Sepkosi|title=A factor analysis description of the Phanerozoic marine fossil record|journal=Paleobiology|volume=7|year=1981|pages=3–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; An evolutionary fauna typically displays an increase in [[biodiversity]] following a [[Logistic function|logistic curve]] followed by extinctions (although the Modern Fauna has not yet exhibited the diminishing part of the curve).

==Cambrian fauna==
Fauna I, known as "Cambrian", described as a "[[Trilobite]]-rich assemblage", encompasses the bulk of the fossils which first appeared in the [[Cambrian explosion]], and largely became extinct in the [[Ordovician-Silurian extinction event]]. This fauna comprises trilobites, [[small shelly fossil]]s (grouped by Sepkoski into "Polychaeta", but including [[cribricyathid]]s, [[coleolid]]s, and [[volborthellid]]s), [[Monoplacophora]], [[Inarticulata|inarticulate brachiopods]] and hyoliths.&lt;ref&gt;Sepkoski, J. J. (1981). A Factor Analytic Description of the Phanerozoic Marine Fossil Record. Paleobiology, 7(1), 36–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paleozoic fauna==
Fauna II, known as "Paleozoic", described as a "[[Brachiopod]]-rich assemblage", accounts for most of the fossils appearing in the [[Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event]], and largely became extinct in the [[Permian-Triassic extinction event]]. This fauna is marked by fossils of the following classes: [[Articulata (Brachiopoda)|Articulata]], [[Crinoidea]], [[Ostracoda]], [[Cephalopoda]], [[Anthozoa]], [[Stenolaemata]], [[Stelleroidea]].

==Modern fauna==
Fauna III, known as "Modern", described as a [[Mollusc]]-rich assemblage", arose largely in the [[Mesozoic-Cenozoic Radiation]], still in progress.The following classes are included: [[Gastropoda]], [[Bivalvia]], [[Osteichthyes]], [[Malacostraca]], [[Echinoidea]], [[Gymnolaemata]], [[Demospongiae]], [[Chondrichthyes]].

==Kindred concepts==
In the mid-19th century, John Phillips suggested three great systems: Palaeozoic, Mesozoic and Caenozoic. Writing after Sepkoski, Brenchley and Harper suggested that there were two early evolutionary faunas before the three of Sepkoski: Ediacaran and Tomottian. They also point out similarities with four "evolutionary terrestrial plant floras": Early Vascular, Pteridophytes, Gymnospores, Angiospores; and three "evolutionary terrestrial tetrapod faunas": "Megadynasty I (Carboniferous-early Permian)" "primitive amphibians and reptiles, most notably ... ''Dimetrodon''", "Megadynasty II (early Permian-mid-Triassic)" "mammal-like therapsids", and "Megadynasty III (late Triassic-Cretaceous)" "included the age of the dinosaurs".

'''Firebug''' is a discontinued [[free and open-source]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/firebug/firebug Firebug on GitHub]&lt;/ref&gt; [[web browser]] extension for [[Firefox|Mozilla Firefox]]&lt;ref name="mozilla add-on"/&gt; that facilitated the live [[debugging]], editing, and monitoring of any website's [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]], [[HTML]], [[Document Object Model|DOM]], [[XMLHttpRequest|XHR]], and [[JavaScript]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://getfirebug.com/whatisfirebug Firebug Home Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

Firebug was licensed under the [[BSD licenses|BSD license]]&lt;ref name="license"/&gt; and was initially written in January 2006 by [[Joe Hewitt (programmer)|Joe Hewitt]], one of the original Firefox creators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oreilly.com/server-administration/excerpts/9780596522315/performance-tools.html O'Reilly Performance Tools: Appendix - Even Faster Websites]&lt;/ref&gt; The Firebug Working Group oversees the open source development and extension of Firebug. It had two major implementations: an extension for Mozilla Firefox and a [[bookmarklet]] implementation called Firebug Lite&lt;ref&gt;[http://getfirebug.com/firebuglite Firebug Lite Homepage]&lt;/ref&gt; which can be used with [[Google Chrome]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://getfirebug.com/releases/lite/chrome/ Firebug Lite for Chrome]&lt;/ref&gt;

Firebug has been deprecated in favor of the integrated developer tools added to Firefox itself, whose functionality has been unified with those of Firebug. As Firefox 57 no longer supports XUL add-ons, Firebug is no longer compatible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/10/saying-goodbye-to-firebug/|title=Saying Goodbye to Firebug|website=Mozilla Hacks|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Version history==

===Version 2.0===

Firebug 2.0 introduced many new features to the Firebug extension including JavaScript [[syntax highlighting]], pretty print for minified JavaScript code, and a DOM Event Inspector to handle all event handlers on a web page. Additionally, users can search for page elements using CSS selectors in the search bar. The debugging tool now allows users to inspect JavaScript expressions as they are evaluated. Moreover, users can inspect values returned from JavaScript functions. It also adds the ability to create new HTML attributes for existing HTML elements.&lt;ref name="Firebug 2.0 Update"&gt;{{cite web|last=Odvarko|first=Jan|title=Firebug 2.0 Release|url=https://blog.getfirebug.com/2014/06/10/firebug-2-0/|publisher=Firebug Working Group|accessdate=15 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Version 3.0===

On November 10, 2014, Firebug 3.0 was announced and an alpha was made available to the public.&lt;ref name="Firebug 3.0 Update"&gt;{{cite web|last=Odvarko|first=Jan|title=Firebug 3.0 The Next Generation|url=https://blog.getfirebug.com/2014/11/10/firebug-3-next-generation-of-firebug/|publisher=Firebug Working Group|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version was to feature a new theme and would have focused on user experience.

==Features==

Firebug makes changes immediately and gives constant feedback to the user.  All editors in Firebug support [[autocomplete]].&lt;ref name="Firebug 2.0 Update"/&gt;

The Firebug command line accepts commands written in JavaScript.  The result of executing each command is displayed in the console, appearing as hyperlinks. The Firebug application contains multiple windows, splitting related features to a common window.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, J. (2007). [http://www.drdobbs.com/tools/ajax-debugging-with-firebug/196802787 Ajax debugging with firebug]. Dr.Dobb's Journal, 32(2), 22-26.&lt;/ref&gt; Firebug also allows users to view the download time for individual files. It separates different types of objects, such as JavaScript files and images, and can determined which files are loaded from a browser's cache. Firebug also features the ability to examine HTTP headers and time stamps relative to when an HTTP request is made.&lt;ref&gt;[http://getfirebug.com/whatisfirebug What is Firebug?]&lt;/ref&gt; Its net panel can monitor URLs that the browser requests, such as external CSS, JavaScript, and image files.

===HTML and CSS===

The HTML and CSS tools allow for the inspection and editing of HTML and CSS elements on a web page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Salkosuo|first=Sami|title=Debug and tune applications on the fly with Firebug|url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/wa-aj-firebug/|publisher=IBM Developer Works|accessdate=6 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later versions of Firebug allow users to see live changes to the CSS.&lt;ref name="Firebug 2.0 Update" /&gt; Visualization of CSS elements is shown while inspecting HTML elements. The Firebug layout tab is used to display and manipulate CSS property values. Furthermore, users can click on any visible HTML elements on a web page to access its CSS property values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zukerman|first=Erez|title=Debug Web Pages in Firefox With Firebug|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/247356/firebug.html|publisher=PC World|accessdate=6 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===JavaScript Console===
Firebug's script tab enables users to set breakpoints and step through lines of code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Suehring|first=Steve|title=Identify JavaScript Problems with Firebug|url=http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/identify-javascript-problems-with-firebug.html|publisher=Dummies}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Firebug can navigate directly to a line of JavaScript code, watch expressions, call stacks, and launch the debugger in the event an error occurs during execution. Firebug can also log errors. Logging uses a Firebug JavaScript API. Firebug's JavaScript panel can log errors, profile function calls, and enable the developer to run arbitrary JavaScript. Firebug allows users to run JavaScript code through the command line and allows the user to log errors that occur in the JavaScript, CSS, and XML. Firebug provides a separate text editor to modify the JavaScript and see immediate results on the user's browser.

As provided in an update, the JavaScript command line features an autocomplete function. The text editor also provides the ability to write full functions. Firebug requires a user to refresh a web page in the event of a crash.

===Extensions===

Many extensions have been made to enhance Firebug. Since Firebug is open source, users can contribute their own extensions to the Firebug community.&lt;ref&gt;[https://getfirebug.com/wiki/index.php/Firebug_Extensions List of Known Firebug Extensions]&lt;/ref&gt;

===FlashFirebug===

FlashFirebug is a paid Firebug extension&lt;ref&gt;[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/flashfirebug ''FlashFirebug Add-on Page'']&lt;/ref&gt; that helps [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] and [[Apache Flex|Flex]] developers [[Debugging|debug]] [[SWF|Adobe SWF]] files on the [[World Wide Web|web]]. FlashFirebug was developed by O-Minds&lt;ref name="ffb"&gt;[http://www.o-minds.com/products/flashfirebug ''O-Minds FlashFirebug Product Page'']&lt;/ref&gt; and is licensed under the [[GPLv3]].

In February 2012, O-Minds purchased the code to FlashBug,&lt;ref name="flashb"&gt;[https://mariani.life/projects/flashbug/ ''Flashbug Project Page'']&lt;/ref&gt; a competing Firefox extension. Flashbug had extensive capabilities to parse [[Action Message Format|AMF]] and [[Local Shared Object|Shared Objects]] objects and partially decompile [[SWF|Adobe SWF]] files directly in the browser.&lt;ref name="flashb"/&gt; Soon after the purchase, O-Minds integrated key features of FlashBug into FlashFirebug and retired Flashbug&lt;ref&gt;[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/flashbug/ ''Flashbug Add-on Page'']&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Add-on (Mozilla)|AMO]] repository.

Currently the extension displays textual Output from trace() commands within the [[SWF|Adobe SWF]] movie,&lt;ref name="ffb"/&gt; a Display Tree with the hierarchy of display objects and their properties,&lt;ref name="ffb"/&gt; viewers for [[Action Message Format|AMF]] and [[Local Shared Object|Shared Objects]],&lt;ref name="ffb"/&gt; and a tool to modify the 3D transformation of any display object on the stage.&lt;ref name="ffb"/&gt;

'''Gayane Khachaturian''' ({{lang-hy|Գայանե Խաչատրյան}}) (May 9, 1942 – May 1, 2009) was a [[Georgian people|Georgian]]-[[Armenian people|Armenian]] painter and graphic artist.

==Biography==

Gayane Khachaturian was born into an Armenian family in [[Tbilisi]], capital of Georgia, and studied art at the Nikoladze Art School. She became seriously involved in the art scene after graduating from the Secondary School of Working Youth in 1960. She met [[Sergei Parajanov]] in 1967 at [[Elene Akhvlediani]]'s house and they maintained a close friendship which lasted until his death. Some of Khachaturian’s works are permanently exhibited at the [[Yerevan]] Museum of Modern Art, the [[National Gallery of Armenia]], [[Sergei Parajanov Museum]] in Yerevan as well as are in a number of private collections, including those owned by Valerie Khanukaev, Bagrat Nikogosyan, and Artashes Aleksanyan. When she was alive, her tiny studio on Bakinskaya Street had become a tourist attraction. According to Russian art critic Vitaly Patsyukov, "Khachaturian is among those pioneers of new artistic consciousness who draw into their focus all phenomenal aspects of European 'actual view' and the radical sensuousness and natural freedom of plastic gesture." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accea.info/images/pdf/09_05N2_Gayane_Catalog_on_A4.pdf Gayane Khachaturian's Catalog, Armenian Pavilion, 53rd International Art Exhibition la Biennale di Venezia]&lt;/ref&gt;

Khachaturian died on May 1, 2009 and is buried in the [[Armenian Pantheon of Tbilisi]] ([[Khojivank]]).

A '''graphoid''' is a set of statements of the form, "''X'' is irrelevant to ''Y'' given that we know ''Z''" where ''X'', ''Y'' and ''Z'' are sets of variables. The notion of "irrelevance" and "given that we know" may obtain different interpretations, including [[Probabilistic logic|probabilistic]], [[Relational logic|relational]] and correlational, depending on the application. These interpretations share common properties that can be captured by paths in graphs (hence the name "graphoid"). The theory of graphoids characterizes these properties in a finite set of [[axioms]] that are common to informational irrelevance and its graphical representations.

==History==
[[Judea Pearl]] and [[Azaria Paz]]&lt;ref name=pearl:paz85&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pearl|first1=Judea|last2=Paz|first2=Azaria|title=Graphoids: A Graph-Based Logic for Reasoning About Relevance Relations|year=1985|url=http://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r53-L.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; coined the term "graphoids" after discovering that a set of axioms that govern [[conditional independence]] in [[probability theory]] is shared by [[undirected graph]]s. Variables are represented as nodes in a graph in such a way that variable sets ''X'' and ''Y'' are independent conditioned on ''Z'' in the distribution whenever node set ''Z'' separates ''X'' from ''Y'' in the graph. Axioms for conditional independence in probability were derived earlier by [[A. Philip Dawid]]&lt;ref name=dawid:79&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dawid|first1=A. Philip|title=Conditional independence in statistical theory|journal=Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B|date=1979|pages=1–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wolfgang Spohn]].&lt;ref name=spohn:80&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spohn|first1=Wolfgang|title=Stochastic independence, causal independence, and shieldability|journal=Journal of Philosophical Logic|date=1980|volume=9|pages=73–99|doi=10.1007/bf00258078}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The correspondence between dependence and graphs was later extended to [[directed acyclic graph]]s (DAGs)&lt;ref name=pearl:86&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pearl|first1=Judea|title=Fusion, propagation and structuring in belief networks|journal=Artificial Intelligence|date=1986|volume=29|issue=3|pages=241–288|doi=10.1016/0004-3702(86)90072-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=verma:pea88&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Verma|first1=Thomas|last2=Pearl|first2=Judea|title=Causal networks: Semantics and expressiveness|journal=Proceedings of the 4th Workshop on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence|date=1988|pages=352–359}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lauritzen:96&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lauritzen|first1=S.L.|title=Graphical Models|date=1996|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to other models of dependency.&lt;ref name=pearl:paz85 /&gt;&lt;ref name=geiger:90&gt;{{cite news|last1=Geiger|first1=Dan|title=Graphoids: A Qualitative Framework for Probabilistic Inference|date=1990|format=PhD Dissertation, Technical Report R-142, Computer Science Department, University of California, Los Angeles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
A dependency model ''M'' is a subset of triplets (''X'',''Z'',''Y'') for which the predicate ''I''(''X'',''Z'',''Y''): ''X'' is independent of ''Y'' given ''Z'', is true.  A graphoid is defined as a dependency model that is closed under the following five axioms:
#Symmetry:    &lt;math&gt;I(X,Z,Y) \Leftrightarrow I(Y,Z,X)&lt;/math&gt;
#Decomposition: &lt;math&gt;I(X,Z,Y\cup W) \Rightarrow I(X,Z,Y)~\&amp;~I(X,Z,W)&lt;/math&gt;
#Weak Union: &lt;math&gt;I(X,Z,Y\cup W) \Rightarrow I(X,Z\cup W,Y)&lt;/math&gt;
#Contraction: &lt;math&gt;I(X,Z,Y)~\&amp;~I(X,Z\cup Y,W) \Rightarrow I(X,Z,Y\cup W)&lt;/math&gt;
#Intersection: &lt;math&gt;I(X,Z\cup W,Y)~\&amp;~I(X,Z\cup Y,W) \Rightarrow I(X,Z,Y\cup W)&lt;/math&gt;

A semi-graphoid is a dependency model closed under (i)–(iv). These five axioms together are known as the graphoid axioms.&lt;ref name=pearl:88&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pearl|first1=Judea|title=Probabilistic reasoning in intelligent systems: networks of plausible inference|date=1988|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intuitively, the weak union and contraction properties mean that irrelevant information should not alter the relevance status of other propositions in the system; what was relevant remains relevant and what was irrelevant remains irrelevant.&lt;ref name=pearl:88/&gt;

==Types of graphoids==

===Probabilistic graphoids&lt;ref name=pearl:paz85/&gt;&lt;ref name=geiger:90/&gt;===
Conditional independence, defined as

: &lt;math&gt;
I(X,Z,Y) \Leftrightarrow P(X\mid Y, Z) = P(X\mid Z)
&lt;/math&gt;

is a semi-graphoid which becomes a full graphoid when ''P'' is strictly positive.

===Correlational graphoids&lt;ref name=pearl:paz85/&gt;&lt;ref name=geiger:90/&gt;===
A dependency model is a correlational graphoid if in some probability function we have,

: &lt;math&gt;
I_c(X,Y,Z) \Leftrightarrow \rho_{xy.z}=0\text{ for every }x \in X\text{ and }y \in Y
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho_{xy.z}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[partial correlation]] between ''x'' and ''y'' given set ''Z''.

In other words, the linear estimation error of the variables in ''X'' using measurements on ''Z'' would not be reduced by adding measurements of the variables in ''Y'', thus making ''Y'' irrelevant to the estimation of  ''X''.  Correlational and probabilistic dependency models coincide for normal distributions.

===Relational graphoids&lt;ref name=pearl:paz85/&gt;&lt;ref name=geiger:90/&gt;===
A dependency model is a relational graphoid if it satisfies
 
: &lt;math&gt;
P(X,Z)&gt;0~\&amp;~P(Y,Z)&gt;0 \implies P(X,Y,Z)&gt;0.
&lt;/math&gt;

In words,  the range of values permitted for ''X'' is not restricted by the choice of ''Y'', once ''Z'' is fixed. Independence statements belonging to this model are similar to [[Multivalued dependency|embedded multi-valued dependencies (EMVD s)]] in databases.

===Graph-induced graphoids===

If there exists an undirected graph ''G'' such that,

: &lt;math&gt;
 I(X,Z,Y)  \Leftrightarrow \langle X,Z,Y\rangle_G, 
&lt;/math&gt;

then the graphoid is called graph-induced. 
In other words,  there exists an undirected graph ''G'' such that every independence statement in ''M'' is reflected as a vertex separation in ''G'' and vice versa. A necessary and sufficient condition for a dependency model to be a graph-induced graphoid is that it satisfies the following axioms: symmetry, decomposition, intersection, strong union and transitivity.

Strong union states that

: &lt;math&gt;
 I(X,Z,Y) \implies I(X,Z\cup W,Y)
&lt;/math&gt;

Transitivity states that

: &lt;math&gt;
 I(X,Z,Y) \implies \left(\forall~\gamma \notin X \cup Y \cup Z,~~I(X,Z,\gamma) \text{ or } I(\gamma, Z,Y)\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

The axioms symmetry, decomposition, intersection, strong union and transitivity constitute a complete characterization of
undirected graphs.&lt;ref&gt;A. Paz, J. Pearl, and S. Ur, "A New Characterization of Graphs Based on Interception Relations" Journal of Graph Theory, Vol. 22, No. 2, 125-136, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

===DAG-induced graphoids===

A graphoid is termed DAG-induced if there exists a directed acyclic graph ''D'' such that &lt;math&gt;I(X,Z,Y)  \Leftrightarrow \langle X,Z,Y\rangle_D&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\langle X,Z,Y\rangle_D&lt;/math&gt; stands for [[Bayesian network|''d''-separation]] in ''D''. ''d''-separation (''d''-connotes "directional") extends the notion of vertex separation from undirected graphs to directed acyclic graphs. It permits the reading of conditional independencies from the structure of [[Bayesian network]]s. However, conditional independencies in a DAG cannot be completely characterized by a  finite set of axioms.

 | date = 1987
 | url=http://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/tech-report/198_-reports/870048.pdf
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inclusion and construction==

Graph-induced and DAG-induced graphoids are
both contained in probabilistic graphoids.&lt;ref name=geiger:pea93&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Geiger|first1=D.|last2=Pearl|first2=J.|title=Logical and algorithmic properties of conditional independence and graphical models|journal=The Annals of Statistics|date=1993|volume=21|issue=4|pages=2001–2021|doi=10.1214/aos/1176349407}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that for every graph ''G'' there exists a probability distribution ''P'' such that every conditional independence in ''P'' is represented in ''G'', and vice versa. The same is true for DAGs.
However, there are probabilistic distributions that are not graphoids and, moreover, there is no finite axiomatization for probabilistic conditional dependencies.

Thomas Verma showed that every semi-graphoid has a recursive way of constructing a DAG in which every ''d''-separation is valid.&lt;ref name=verma:pea90&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Verma|first1=T.|last2=Pearl|first2=J.|editor1-last=Shachter|editor1-first=R.|editor2-last=Levitt|editor2-first=T.S.|editor3-last=Kanal|editor3-first=L.N.|title=Causal Networks: Semantics and Expressiveness|journal=Uncertainty in AI 4|date=1990|pages=69–76|publisher=Elsevier Science Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The construction is similar to that used in [[Bayes networks]] and goes as follows:
#Arrange the variables in some arbitrary order 1, 2,...,i,...,''N'' and, starting with ''i''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,
#choose for each node ''i'' a set of nodes ''PA''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; such that ''i'' is independent on all its predecessors, 1, 2,...,''i''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1, conditioned on ''PA''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.
#Draw arrows from ''PA''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; to ''i'' and continue.
The DAG created by this construction will represent all the conditional independencies that
follow from those used in the construction. Furthermore, every ''d''-separation shown in the DAG will be a valid conditional independence in the graphoid used in the construction.

'''Henry Odera Oruka''' (1 June 1944, [[Nyanza Province]] – 9 December 1995, [[Nairobi]]) was a Kenyan philosopher who is best known for "Sage Philosophy". It was a project started in the 1970s in an attempt to preserve the knowledge of the indigenous thinkers in traditional African communities.

==Life and work==
Henry Odera Oruka was born on 1 June 1944 in [[Nyanza Province]] of [[Kenya]]. After his advanced level studies in Kenya, he went to [[Uppsala University]] in Sweden. There he registered for a BSc programme in the Faculty of Mathematics–Natural Science and studied Meteorology, Geography, and [[Geodesy]]. He later added Philosophy to his studies because of his interest in the subject. Upon graduating in Science and Philosophy (a year ahead of his class), he opted to drop science and continue with his studies in Philosophy. He moved to [[Wayne State University]] in the United States of America for his master's degree where he completed his studies and eventually obtained a PhD. His dissertation on the theme of "Freedom" (written in 1970) was later refined and published as ''Punishment and Terrorism in Africa'' in 1976. From October 1970 until his death on 9 December 1995, he taught Philosophy at the [[University of Nairobi]].&lt;ref&gt;See F. Ochieng'-Odhiambo, "An African Savant: Henry Odera Oruka," ''Quest'' IX/2 &amp; X/1, 12–13&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority and dominant staff at the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies which had been launched in 1969 at the University of Nairobi were priests and [[lay theologian]]s. They had little time for "African Philosophy" as they harbored doubts about the ability of Africans to think logically. After years of a sustained and bitter struggle spearheaded by Odera Oruka, Philosophy was separated from Religion at the university in July 1980 and he was appointed the Founder-Chairman of the new Department of Philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;See H. Odera Oruka, ''Trends in Contemporary African Philosophy'', Shirikon Publishers, 1990, 126–127.&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately for the Department, the death of Odera Oruka was accompanied with a marked decline in the international profile of Philosophy at the University of Nairobi. The discipline that Odera Oruka worked so hard to separate from Religion has since been merged with Religion once again.

Odera Oruka was the founder-president of the Philosophical Association of Kenya (PAK); the founding-director of the International Institute of Environmental Studies(IIES), Nairobi; a member of the Kenya National Academy of Sciences (KNAS); the secretary-general of African Futures Studies Association (AFSA); the secretary-general of the Afro-Asian Philosophical Association (AAPA); vice-president of the Inter-African Council of Philosophy (IACP); a member of the Executive committee of both the Federation International de societe philosophique (FISP) and [[World Futures Studies Federation]].&lt;ref&gt;See Chaungo Barasa, "Odera Oruka and the Sage Philosophy School: A Tribute," in ''Sagacious Reasoning: Henry Odrea Oruka in Memoriam'', eds. Anke Graness &amp; Kai Kresse, Peter Lang, 1997, 21. See also F. Ochieng'-Odhiambo, op. cit., 19.&lt;/ref&gt; On June 3, 1993, he received an [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorate]] from the Faculty of Humanities from Uppsala University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.uu.se/en/about-uu/traditions/prizes/honorary-doctorates/ |title=Honorary doctorates |website=Uppsala University  |publisher=Uppsala University  |access-date=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Odera Oruka was married twice. His first wife, Millicent Achien'g, bore him three children: Owiso Odera (the deceased &lt;ref&gt;http://hollywoodlife.com/2016/11/06/oswiso-odero-dead-originals-actor-collapses-dies/&lt;/ref&gt; Hollywood actor), Sheila Odera (Veteran Actress/Model and Accountant), and Sharon Odera. He had two children with his second wife, Olivia Phoebe Ayoma, namely Ronnie Omuga and Peter Oruka Odera(an International relations practitioner).

==Basic philosophical beliefs==
Three philosophical approaches can be seen in Okura's works:

;Socio-economic deprivation
Poverty and hunger in Africa are the greatest constraints to mental development and creativity. But, rather than complaining about imperialism, colonialism, foreign cultural domination etc., the remedy should be looked for by a process of self-national examination and critique.

;Cultural racial mythology
The fight against cultural and racial mythologies was one of his main topics. He differentiated two types of myths: Myths about the level of civilisation and nobility of some races as opposed to the backwardness and slave mentality of others. The second myth is about the philosophic-scientific gifts of certain races and the corresponding lack in other races, Africa always being on the ungifted and uncivilised side of the scale.

;Illusion of appearance
He divided the meaning of appearance into three parts. In the first part, he describes a reliance on outward appearance as a disease of most people in the society. The second meaning is appearance as it is manipulated by business tycoons and others in power to boost their rank and influence. In the third part, the philosophical level, appearance becomes an obstacle to intellectual activity. This type of appearance is prominent in the field of education, where people are taught styles rather than substance. The result is not knowledge but prejudice, racism, tribalism, sexism and irrational indifference to other cultures. This prompted him to analyse concepts to arrive at generally accepted truth rather than relying on mere appearance.

===The existence of an independent African philosophy===
There has been considerable (and often acrimonious) debate about the pre-Western existence of an independent [[African philosophy]] and what its nature might be. Odera Oruka identified four trends or approaches in this discussion.&lt;ref&gt;See H. Odera Oruka, " Four Trends in Current African Philosophy," in ''Philosophy in the Present Situation of Africa'', ed. Alwin Diemer, Franz Steiner Verlag, 1981, 1–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Ethnophilosophy
Describes the worldview or thought-system of particular African communities as philosophy. This type of philosophy sees the African way of thinking as "communal thought" and describes its emotional appeal as one of its unique features. Examples of those holding this position are: [[Placide Tempels]], [[Leopold Sedar Senghor]], [[John Mbiti|John S. Mbiti]], and [[Alexis Kagame]].

;Nationalistic-Ideological philosophy
Consists of works of founding-fathers and statesmen in Africa, whose social-political theories were based on traditional African socialism and family values. Among them were: [[Kwame Nkrumah]], Sekou Toure, [[Julius Nyerere]], and [[Kenneth Kaunda]].

;Professional philosophy
This is the position generally taken by professionally trained students or teachers of philosophy. They reject [[Ethnophilosophy]] and instead adopt a [[universalism|universalistic]] point of view. In their opinion, African philosophy should be approached with the same forms of critical analysis applied to mainstream Western philosophy. A descriptive approach, by itself, is more appropriate to the field of anthropology and applies different standards to African thought. Philosophers belonging to this trend include: [[Kwasi Wiredu]], [[Paulin Hountondji]], [[Peter O. Bodunrin]], and Odera Oruka.

==Philosophic Sagacity==
Philosophic Sagacity is Odera Oruka's research project begun in the early 1970s designed to preserve the philosophical thoughts of traditional Kenyan sages. The basic principle of Philosophic Sagacity is that in both traditional and modern Africa there exist women and men, illiterate and literate, who commonly engage in philosophical reflection on various problems of human life and nature in general.

Unlike ethnophilosophy, which emphasises communal thinking, Philosophic Sagacity searches for individual thinkers in the traditional community. These "sages" express and defend their philosophical thoughts and opinions on various issues of nature and human life. Some of these thoughts even if not philosophical in the strict sense could nevertheless constitute raw data for technical philosophical reflections by professional or trained philosophers. Oruka wanted to point out that there is and was a ''philosophy'' in Africa in the fullest sense of the word: a philosophy that deals with daily human problems and issues which are common to every human being, such as the existence of a Deity, life, knowledge, death etc. Such issues are not the sole domain of literate people but are usually best addressed by the few who can "transcend" the communal way of thinking.

Though some have often equated "Sage Philosophy" with "Philosophic sagacity," Odera Oruka did not. Odera Oruka distinguished between two wings of Sage Philosophy: (1) being the folk or popular sagacity, and (2) being the philosophic sagacity. While the former expresses well known communal maxims, aphorisms and general common sense truths, the latter expresses the thoughts of wise men and women that transcend popular wisdom and attain a philosophic capacity.&lt;ref&gt;H. Odera Oruka,  "Sage Philosophy: The Basic Question," in ''Sage Philosophy: Indigenous Thinkers and Modern Debate on African Philosophy'', ed. H. Odera Oruka, E. J. Brill, 1990, 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence whereas all instances of philosophic sagacity locate within sage philosophy, not every instance of sage philosophy constitute philosophic sagacity. The novelty of Odera Oruka's project is to be found in philosophic sagacity since the folk sagacity dimension of sage philosophy would be a fallback to ethnophilosophy.&lt;ref&gt;For a more extensive distinction between "Sage Philosophy" and "Philosophic Sagacity," see F. Ochieng'-Odhiambo, "The Evolution of Sagacity: The Three Stages of Oruka's Philosophy," ''Philosophia Africana'' 5, no. 1 (2002): 19–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The method===
Odera Oruka and his colleagues went with tape recorders into villages of different ethnic communities in Kenya to engage those who were thought by their own communities to be wise. The discourses were held in the native language of the presumptive wise men or women.
Each "wise statement" was challenged by the interlocutors. If the person had a philosophical frame of mind he/she would be able to offer rational answers to the objections or requests for clarification. If he/she had not, he/she gave unsatisfactory answers or perhaps was unable to reply. It was believed by this method true philosophy could be separated from popular wisdom.

===Criticisms of Philosophic Sagacity===
Philosophic Sagacity is not philosophy is the main argument of [[D. A. Masolo]]. Based on [[Socratic method]], his analysis shows how frequently tradition and opinion are based on insufficient reasoning. For him, true philosophy relies on analysis, definition, and explanation. [[Pre-Socratic]] knowledge has no place in strict philosophy. Philosophic sagacity, he believes, falls into the category of pre-Socratic philosophy. Both fail in a consistent attitude towards, and practice of, rational explanation, despite the presence of the "sage" and the discourse with him/her. A mere discussion of a topic does not have the high degree of abstraction, conceptual analysis, and relation which, according to him, are the essence of strict philosophy.

Masolo also objects to the [[Afrocentric]] perspective inherent in Odera Oruka's approach to treating pre-literate African men and women as proto-philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;See D. A. Masolo, ''African Philosophy in Search of Identity'', Indiana University Press, 1994, 237.&lt;/ref&gt; This appears to be a misunderstanding. For Odera Oruka, Philosophic Sagacity lies between ethnophilosophy and professional philosophy and is simply a starting point in determining the nature of African Philosophy.

In his essay, "The Philosopher and the Sage: On the Question of African Philosophy", Peter O. Bodunrin rejects Odera Oruka's notion that philosophic sagacity is philosophy because, for him, literacy is a necessary condition for philosophical reflections. His second, related, objection is one common to anthropology: the influence of the observer. If a philosopher interviews a "sage", is the result really the work of the "sage" or a joint product? Who is the actual creator of the "philosophy"?&lt;ref&gt;See Peter O. Bodunrin, "The Question of African Philosophy," ''Philosophy'' 56, no. 216 (1981): 168–169.&lt;/ref&gt; Odera Oruka responded to such thought by pointing out that thinking normally precedes writing and that the intent of the discourses is to produce raw material, to be used by the philosopher in his effort to prove that true philosophy exists on African soil.&lt;ref&gt;See H. Odera Oruka, "Sagacity in African Philosophy," ''International Philosophical Quarterly'' 23 (1983): 391.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anthony Oseghare]], a PhD student of Odera Oruka, makes a distinction between sagacity and knowledge. Both involve the acquisition and usage of skills, but they are not identical. Sagacity involves wisdom of a practical nature which is achieved through experience. It has a broader meaning than knowledge. Within sagacity too, there is a sagacity that stops with common sense and a sagacity that transcends common sense.&lt;ref&gt;See Anthony Sunday Oseghare, ''Relevance of Sagacious Reasoning in African Philosophy'', Doctoral dissertation, University of Nairobi, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; Oseghare's critique, unlike Masolo's and Bodunrin's, is not negative but meant to clarify and enhance Odera Oruka's project.

A point worth noting is the distinction between sages and prophets. They could be confused in that both are concerned with efforts to resolve problems that affect human society. It is also true that a sage can be a prophet and a prophet can be a sage but the critical fact is that they are not identical. The basic difference – according to Odera Oruka – is that the prophet claims to predict the future based on past experience, whereas a sage is concerned with fundamental issues of ethics and other questions of immediate importance. A sage has the ability to offer insightful solutions to practical issues. Sages have existed in every society as custodians of its culture and values, regardless of literacy.&lt;ref&gt;See H. Odera Oruka, "Introduction," in ''Sage Philosophy: Indigenous Thinkers and Modern Debate on African Philosophy'', op. cit., 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt; After Odera Oruka's death philosophers who have continued to push the agenda of sagacity include Kenyan born scholars F. Ochieng'-Odhiambo and Oriare Nyarwath together with American Gail Presbey.

==Ethics==
Lesser known are Odera Oruka's contributions to ethical questions, such as protection of the environment and the justification of foreign aid.
In his article "The Philosophy of Foreign Aid" Odera Oruka responded to [[Garrett Hardin|Garret Hardin's]] "Life Boat Theory". Hardin argues against helping poor nations because they will believe their problems are being solved, the population will grow, and the "boat" will sink.

Odera Oruka gave three possible reasons to justify foreign aid: charity (common decency), promoting international trade, and historical rectification. He later added another argument: the "right to a human minimum".

In his article "Parent Earth Ethics" Odera Oruka uses the metaphor of a family of six children with varying degrees of wealth and poverty to explain his argument. These six children have some things in common and each has his/her own individual talents and possessions. He made the following distinctions:

'''Rule One:''' ''Parental Debt Principle''
(a.) Family Security Rule
(b.) Parental Debt Rule
(c.) Individual Family Survival Rule

'''Rule Two:''' ''The Individual Luck Principle''
(a.) Personal Achievements Rule
(b.) Personal Supererogation Rule
(c.) Public Law Rule

The entire system cannot be detailed within the scope of this article but, from the above outline, the main points are as follows: The ''Parental Debt Principle'' occurs prior to the ''Individual Luck Principle''. Under normal circumstances, if the first rule comes into conflict with anything in the second rule, the first rule takes priority. This is "the ethics of common sense". If the wealth and security of the community comes in conflict with personal luck or achievements, the former prevails over the latter. This type of ethics can be applied to both environmental concerns and the redistribution of wealth.

'''Herbert Fingarette''' (20 January 1921 – 2 November 2018)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/15/obituaries/herbert-fingarette-dead.html&lt;/ref&gt; was an American philosopher and emeritus professor of philosophy at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Department of Philosophy - People|url=http://www.philosophy.ucsb.edu/people/index.html|publisher=University of California, Santa Barbara|accessdate=26 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He received his PhD at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] under the direction of Donald Piatt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Herbert Fingarette|url=https://philosophyfamilytree.wikispaces.com/Herbert+Fingarette|publisher=Philosophy Family Tree|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fingarette's work deals with issues in philosophy of mind, psychology, ethics, law, and Chinese philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Philosophy Faculty|url=http://www.philosophy.ucsb.edu/people/index.html|publisher=University of California - Santa Barbara|accessdate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1969 monograph ''Self-Deception'', Fingarette presents an account of the titular concept influenced by the work of [[Jean-Paul Sartre]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hirsch|first=Julie|title=Ethics and Self-Deception|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/eth-self/|publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sören Kierkegaard]]  and [[Sigmund Freud]], as well as contemporary work in physiology and analytic philosophy. Fingarette argues that traditional accounts of self-deception fall invariably into paradox because these accounts see self-deception in terms of perception or knowledge. Such paradoxes may be resolved, Fingarette claims, by re-framing self-deception as a problem of volition and action. On these new terms, he defines self-deception as an agent's persistent refusal to "spell out" (explicitly acknowledge) and to avow some aspect of her engagement in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fingarette|first=Herbert|title=Self-Deception|year=2000|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0520220528|pages=34, 46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fingarette's 1972 monograph ''Confucius: The Secular As Sacred'' was described in a peer-reviewed academic journal as "one of the most significant philosophical books on the subject to be published in a long time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosemont Jr.|first=Henry|title=Review: Confucius--The Secular as Sacred by Herbert Fingarette|journal=Philosophy East and West|date=October 1976|volume=26|issue=4|pages=463–477|jstor=1398287|doi=10.2307/1398287|last2=Fingarette|first2=Herbert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fingarette has also influentially applied his work in moral psychology to pressing social and legal issues, particularly those surrounding addiction. In his 1988 book ''Heavy Drinking'', Fingarette gainsays the disease theory of alcoholism popularized by groups such as [[Alcoholics Anonymous]]. Fingarette's arguments were famously employed by the U.S. Supreme Court in a 1988 decision to deny VA educational benefits to two alcoholic American veterans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Beyette|first=Beverly|title=Alcoholism: Is It Really a Disease? : Controversial Author Contends Drinking Is Modifiable Behavior|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-03-23/news/vw-1748_1_alcoholic-behavior|publisher=LA Times|accessdate=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Peele|first=Sandford|title=Herbert Fingarette, Radical Revisionist Why Are People So Upset With This Retiring Philosopher?|url=http://www.peele.net/lib/fingers.php|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Inferences''' are steps in [[reasoning]], moving from [[premise]]s to [[logical consequence]]s. [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] divided inference into three kinds: [[deductive reasoning|deduction]], [[inductive reasoning|induction]], and [[Abductive reasoning|abduction]].  Deduction is inference [[Formal proof|deriving]] [[Logical consequence|logical conclusions]] from premises known or assumed to be [[truth|true]],  with the [[Rule of inference|laws of valid inference]] being studied in [[logic]].  Induction is inference from [[particular]] premises to a [[Universal (metaphysics)|universal]] conclusion.  Abduction is inference to the best explanation.

Human inference (i.e. how humans draw conclusions) is traditionally studied within the field of [[cognitive psychology]]; [[artificial intelligence]] researchers develop automated inference systems to emulate human inference.

[[Statistical inference]] uses mathematics to draw conclusions in the presence of uncertainty. This generalizes deterministic reasoning, with the absence of uncertainty as a special case. Statistical inference uses quantitative or qualitative (categorical) data which may be subject to random variations.

==Definition==
The process by which a conclusion is inferred from multiple observations is called [[inductive reasoning]].  The conclusion may be correct or incorrect, or correct to within a certain degree of accuracy, or correct in certain situations.  Conclusions inferred from multiple observations may be tested by additional observations.

This definition is disputable (due to its lack of clarity. Ref: Oxford English dictionary: "induction ... 3. Logic the inference of a general law from particular instances." {{clarify|reason=Some information, probably encoded by different type fonts in the dictionary, seems to have got lost. I assume, under the keyword 'induction (logic)', the dictionary says 'the inference of a general law from particular instances'. Please check with the source and clarify.|date=August 2013}}) The definition given thus applies only when the "conclusion" is general.

Two possible definitions of "inference" are:
# A conclusion reached on the basis of evidence and reasoning.
# The process of reaching such a conclusion.

==Examples==
===Example for definition #1===
[[Ancient Greek philosophy|Ancient Greek philosophers]] defined a number of [[syllogism]]s, correct three part inferences, that can be used as building blocks for more complex reasoning. We begin with a famous example:
# All humans are mortal.
# All Greeks are humans.
# All Greeks are mortal.

The reader can check that the premises and conclusion are true, but logic is concerned with inference: does the truth of the conclusion follow from that of the premises?

The validity of an inference depends on the form of the inference. That is, the word "valid" does not refer to the truth of the premises or the conclusion, but rather to the form of the inference.  An inference can be valid even if the parts are false, and can be invalid even if some parts are true.  But a valid form with true premises will always have a true conclusion.

For example, consider the form of the following [[Symbology|symbological]] track:
#All meat comes from animals.
#All beef is meat.
#Therefore, all beef comes from animals.

If the premises are true, then the conclusion is necessarily true, too.

Now we turn to an invalid form.
#All A are B.
#All C are B.
#Therefore, all C are A.

To show that this form is invalid, we demonstrate how it can lead from true premises to a false conclusion.
#All apples are fruit. (True)
#All bananas are fruit. (True)
#Therefore, all bananas are apples. (False)

A valid argument with a false premise may lead to a false conclusion, (this and the following examples do not follow the Greek syllogism):
#All tall people are French. (False)
#John Lennon was tall. (True)
#Therefore, John Lennon was French. (False)

When a valid argument is used to derive a false conclusion from a false premise, the inference is valid because it follows the form of a correct inference.

A valid argument can also be used to derive a true conclusion from a false premise:
#All tall people are musicians. (Valid, False)
#John Lennon was tall. (Valid, True)
#Therefore, John Lennon was a musician. (Valid, True)

In this case we have one false premise and one true premise where a true conclusion has been inferred.

===Example for definition #2===

Evidence:  It is the early 1950s and you are an American stationed in the [[Soviet Union]].  You read in the [[Moscow]] newspaper that a [[soccer]] team from a small city in [[Siberia]] starts winning game after game.  The team even defeats the Moscow team.  Inference: The small city in Siberia is not a small city anymore.  The Soviets are working on their own nuclear or high-value secret weapons program.

Knowns: The Soviet Union is a [[command economy]]: people and material are told where to go and what to do.  The small city was remote and historically had never distinguished itself; its soccer season was typically short because of the weather.

Explanation:  In a [[command economy]], people and material are moved where they are needed.  Large cities might field good teams due to the greater availability of high quality players; and teams that can practice longer (weather, facilities) can reasonably be expected to be better.  In addition, you put your best and brightest in places where they can do the most good—such as on high-value weapons programs.  It is an anomaly for a small city to field such a good team.  The anomaly (i.e. the soccer scores and great soccer team) indirectly described a condition by which the observer inferred a new meaningful pattern—that the small city was no longer small.  Why would you put a large city of your best and brightest in the middle of nowhere?  To hide them, of course.

==Incorrect inference==
An incorrect inference is known as a [[fallacy]]. Philosophers who study [[informal logic]] have compiled large lists of them, and cognitive psychologists have documented many [[cognitive bias|biases in human reasoning]] that favor incorrect reasoning.

==Applications==

===Inference engines===
{{main|Reasoning system|Inference engine|expert system|business rule engine}}

AI systems first provided automated logical inference and these were once extremely popular research topics, leading to industrial applications under the form of [[expert system]]s and later [[business rule engine]]s.  More recent work on [[automated theorem proving]] has had a stronger
basis in formal logic.

An inference system's job is to extend a knowledge base automatically. The knowledge base (KB) is a set of propositions that represent what the system knows about the world. Several techniques can be used by that system to extend KB by means of valid inferences. An additional requirement is that the conclusions the system arrives at are [[relevance|relevant]] to its task.

====Prolog engine====
[[Prolog]] (for "Programming in Logic") is a [[programming language]] based on a [[subset]] of [[predicate calculus]]. Its main job is to check whether a certain proposition can be inferred from a KB (knowledge base) using an algorithm called [[backward chaining]].

Let us return to our [[Socrates]] [[syllogism]]. We enter into our Knowledge Base the following piece of code:

 mortal(X) :- 	man(X).
 man(socrates). 
( Here ''''':-''''' can be read as "if".  Generally, if ''P {{imp}} Q'' (if P then Q)  then in Prolog we would code ''Q''':-'''P'' (Q if P).)&lt;br /&gt;
This states that all men are mortal and that Socrates is a man. Now we can ask the Prolog system about Socrates:

 ?- mortal(socrates).
(where ''?-'' signifies a query: Can ''mortal(socrates).'' be deduced from the KB using the rules)
gives the answer "Yes".

On the other hand, asking the Prolog system the following:

 ?- mortal(plato).

gives the answer "No".

This is because [[Prolog]] does not know anything about [[Plato]], and hence defaults to any property about Plato being false (the so-called [[closed world assumption]]). Finally
?- mortal(X) (Is anything mortal) would result in "Yes" (and in some implementations: "Yes": X=socrates)&lt;br /&gt;
[[Prolog]] can be used for vastly more complicated inference tasks. See the corresponding article for further examples.

===Semantic web===
Recently automatic reasoners found in [[semantic web]] a new field of application. Being based upon [[description logic]], knowledge expressed using one variant of [[Web Ontology Language|OWL]] can be logically processed, i.e., inferences can be made upon it.

===Bayesian statistics and probability logic===
{{main|Bayesian inference}}

Philosophers and scientists who follow the [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian framework]] for inference use the mathematical rules of [[probability]] to find this best explanation. The Bayesian view has a number of desirable features—one of them is that it embeds deductive (certain) logic as a subset (this prompts some writers to call Bayesian probability "probability logic", following [[E. T. Jaynes]]).

Bayesian's identify probabilities with degrees of beliefs, with certainly true propositions having probability 1, and certainly false propositions having probability 0. To say that "it's going to rain tomorrow" has a 0.9 probability is to say that you consider the possibility of rain tomorrow as extremely likely.

Through the rules of probability, the probability of a conclusion and of alternatives can be calculated. The best explanation is most often identified with the most probable (see [[Bayesian decision theory]]). A central rule of Bayesian inference is [[Bayes' theorem]].

===Fuzzy logic===

{{main||Fuzzy logic}}

{{expand section|date=October 2016}}

=== Non-monotonic logic ===

{{main|Non-monotonic logic}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |first=André  |last=Fuhrmann  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031209221248/http://www.uni-konstanz.de/FuF/Philo/Philosophie/Fuhrmann/papers/nomoLog.pdf  |archivedate= 9 December 2003 |url=http://www.uni-konstanz.de/FuF/Philo/Philosophie/Fuhrmann/papers/nomoLog.pdf  |title=Nonmonotonic Logic |ref=Fuhrmann, Nonmonotonic Logic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A relation of inference is [[monotonicity of entailment|monotonic]] if the addition of premises does not undermine previously reached conclusions; otherwise the relation is [[Nonmonotonic logic|non-monotonic]].
Deductive inference is monotonic: if a conclusion is reached on the basis of a certain set of premises, then that conclusion still holds if more premises are added.

By contrast, everyday reasoning is mostly non-monotonic because it involves risk: we jump to conclusions from deductively insufficient premises.
We know when it is worth or even necessary (e.g. in medical diagnosis) to take the risk. Yet we are also aware that such inference is defeasible—that new information may undermine old conclusions. Various kinds of defeasible but remarkably successful inference have traditionally captured the attention of philosophers (theories of induction, Peirce's theory of [[abductive reasoning|abduction]], inference to the best explanation, etc.). More recently logicians have begun to approach the phenomenon from a formal point of view. The result is a large body of theories at the interface of philosophy, logic and artificial intelligence.

'''Jacques Hassoun''' (20 October 1936 &amp;ndash; 24 April 1999) was a French [[psychoanalyst]] and proponent of the ideas of [[Jacques Lacan]].  

Hassoun developed a theory of [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and a reparative theory of transmission. He wrote about certain [[pathologies]] in children of immigrants. Hassoun examined the special problems they face in processing and transmitting what is mostly communicated to them through their parents' narratives of displacement, loss and exile. He was one of the first to evoke the heritage of the [[History of the Jews in Egypt|Jews of Egypt]] in modern times. He wrote about their history, customs, religious observance, and languages. He showed particular interest in the [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite community]]. 

Hassoun traveled to Egypt with groups of compatriots when Eqyptian president [[Anwar Sadat]] made it possible for Jews to visit Egypt. Hassoun wrote several works on the history of the modern Jews of Egypt, among them ''Histoire des Juifs du Nil'' (Minerve,1990)[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/rainforest/vines/5855/hassoun.htm&amp;date=2009-10-26+01:23:40], ''Alexandies et autres récits'' and ''Alexandries'' (a novel). He wrote eloquently of the culture of the Jews of Egypt and of their disappearance in the wake of [[Egyptian nationalism]]. 

Hassoun was born in [[Alexandria, Egypt]] in 1936 and settled in [[France]] in 1954 at the age of 18 where he was exiled after being accused and imprisoned by Egyptian authorities for [[communist]] activity. He remained in France for the rest of his life.  Hassoun spoke [[French language|French]], [[Arabic]], and [[Hebrew]] fluently.

Hassoun died from a [[brain tumor]] at age 63, in [[Paris]].

== Theory of melancholy ==

For Hassoun, [[Melancholia|melancholy]] (or depression) stems from an individual's desire for some undesignated ''other''.

In Hassoun's model, the mother's attentiveness at the moment of [[weaning]] is crucial to the [[infant]]'s [[Self-concept|sense of self]]. The mother must be seen by the infant to [[mourn]], disapprove, begrudge, hesitate in the process of weaning. If she does not, the infant will recognize the mother's gesture as [[Apathy|indifference]]. Melancholy is the result of the infant's sensing the mother's indifference at the moment of separation. Henceforth, he will be unable to mourn, having been unable to recognize loss in the mother's eyes. Weaning is a mirroring that leaves the subject both unable to mourn and unable to care—leaves the child in the state of melancholy. Melancholy for Hassoun is the result of a gesture that leaves the infant to suffer interminably for having spied the mother's indifference at the moment of weaning.

== About memory and retelling ==
Hassoun said that the need to tell the past comes up when there's a crisis: when the individual grows up; when there's the urge to preserve a culture, etc. New facts means psychological effort to adapt, this can cause a person to reject that new things/ situation. People go back to the past when there's the need to adapt, because they consider experiences from the past a tool to survive. 

Telling the past does not mean telling somebody to follow [[traditions]]. Traditions subject the individual to follow patterns which may cause more damage than good. Retelling the past is another thing. It is never pure repetition but interpretation. Transmission takes the present into consideration when turning one's attention to the past. Without transmission all we have is nostalgia.

'''James Mylne''' ([[Kinnaird, Gowrie]], 3 September 1757 – 21 September 1839) was a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[philosopher]] and academic who was born in [[Perthshire]] in 1757 and educated at the [[University of St Andrews]]. He served as Professor of Moral Philosophy at the [[University of Glasgow]] from 1797 to 1837. His father-in-law was the philosopher [[John Millar (philosopher)|John Millar]] and the philosopher [[James McCosh]] was among his students. He was a member of the [[Glasgow Literary Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/biography/?id=WH1192&amp;type=P|title=University of Glasgow :: Story :: Biography of James Mylne|work=gla.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also the great-uncle of [[Frances Wright]], who lived with him for a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monticello.org/site/research-and-collections/frances-wright|title=Frances Wright|work=monticello.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mylne is the subject of a biography, ''Rational Piety and Social Reform in Glasgow'' (Wipf and Stock, 2015), by Dr Stephen Cowley. Mylne's philosophy was a theistic empiricism and he regarded utility as the primary measure of morality. He found a larger place for reason in mental life than his predecessors at Glasgow Francis Hutcheson and Thomas Reid, of the moral sense and common sense schools respectively. Mylne also lectured on political economy at Glasgow University from a standpoint generally sympathetic to Adam Smith. Politically he was a Whig.

'''Jewish existentialism''' is a category of work by [[Jewish]] authors dealing with [[Existentialism|existentialist]] themes and concepts (e.g. debate about the existence of God and the meaning of human existence), and intended to answer theological questions that are important in [[Judaism]]. The existential [[angst]] of [[Job (Bible)|Job]] is an example from the [[Hebrew Bible]] of the existentialist [[Theme (literature)|theme]]. [[Theodicy]] and post-Holocaust theology make up a large part of 20th century Jewish existentialism.

Examples of Jewish thinkers and philosophers whose works include existentialist themes are [[Martin Buber]], [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]], [[Lev Shestov]], [[Franz Kafka]], [[Franz Rosenzweig]], [[Hans Jonas]], [[Emmanuel Levinas]], [[Hannah Arendt]], [[Abraham Joshua Heschel|Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel]], and [[Emil Fackenheim]].

==Precursors==

Jewish existentialism finds its roots in both the traditional philosophical school of [[existentialism]] and the peculiarities of [[Jewish theology]], Biblical commentary, and European Jewish culture. Existentialism as a philosophical system grew as a result of the works of such non-Jewish thinkers as [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Albert Camus]], and [[Martin Heidegger]].

The Books of [[Ecclesiastes]] and [[Book of Job|Job]], found in the [[Hebrew Bible]] and often cited as examples of [[wisdom literature]] in the Hebrew Biblical tradition, both include existentialist themes. The Book of Job tells the story of Job, who is beset by both God and satan by many hardships intended to test his faith. He ultimately keeps his faith and receives redemption and rewards from God. The Book of Job includes many discussions between Job and his friends, as well as between Job and God concerning the nature, origin, and purpose of evil and suffering in the world. The Book of Ecclesiastes is broader in scope and includes many meditations on the meaning of life and God's purpose for human beings on Earth. Passages in Ecclesiastes describe human existence in such terms as "all is futile"&lt;ref name="i"&gt;Ecclesiastes, 1: 2&lt;/ref&gt; and "futile and pursuit of wind".&lt;ref name="ii"&gt;Ecclesiastes, 2: 26&lt;/ref&gt; Much Biblical scholarship and Talmud exegesis has been devoted to exploring the apparent contradiction between the affirmation of an [[omnipotent|all-powerful]] God's existence and the futility, meaningless, and/or difficulty of human life. Judaism's treatment of theodicy makes heavy use of the Books of Job and Ecclesiastes.

Some of the trends in the modern philosophy of existentialism come from concepts important to early rabbinic and pre-rabbinic Judaism. William Barret's ''[[Irrational Man]]'', which traces the history of existentialist thought in the Western world, explains how the competing worldviews of Greco-Roman culture and Hebrew/Jewish culture have helped shape modern existentialism. Barrett says that the Hebraic concept of the "man of faith" is one "who is passionately committed to his own being".&lt;ref name="iii"&gt;Barret, William. Irrational Man: a Study in Existential Philosophy. New York: Anchor Books, Doubleday, 1990. 76-77.&lt;/ref&gt; The Hebrew "man of faith", Barrett says, trusts in a God who can only know through "experience" and not "reasoning". Juxtaposed with the believing Hebrew is the skeptical Greek "man of reason" who seeks to attain God through "rational abstraction". The Greek invention of logic and the tradition of rational philosophical inquiry contributed to Existentialism. The Greeks invented philosophy as an academic discipline and as a way to approach the problems of existence, eventually resulting in the philosophical works of [[Nietzsche]], [[Heidegger]], [[Sartre]], [[Kierkegaard]] and other existentialists. Hebraic thought trends had much more of an influence on the important concepts of existentialism. Much of modern existentialism may be seen as more Jewish than Greek.

Several core concepts found in the ancient Hebrew tradition that are often cited as the most important concepts explored by existentialism, for example, the "uneasiness" "deep within Biblical man", also his "sinfulness" and "feebleness and finiteness". While "the whole impulse of philosophy for Plato arises from an ardent search for escape from the evils of the world and the curse of time", Biblical Judaism recognizes the impossibility of trying to transcend the world entirely via intellectualism, lofty thoughts, and ideals. As the late Jewish existentialist Rabbi [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]] (b. 1903–1993) articulates for a popular audience of secular Jews,

{{quote|
"the idea of holiness according to halakhic [Jewish law] world view does not signify a transcendent realm completely separate and removed from reality...of the supreme good...the halakhic conception of holiness...[is] the holiness of the concrete."&lt;ref name="ix"&gt;Soloveitchik, Joseph B. Halakhic Man. Lanham: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1984. 45-46.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the words of Barret, "right conduct is the ultimate concern of the Hebrew",&lt;ref name="xii"&gt;Barret, 71.&lt;/ref&gt; and indeed for the observant Jew, according to R. Soloveitchik. Therefore, the Jewish tradition is differentiated from the Greek system of thought, which emphasizes correct knowledge, thinking, and consciousness as the passports to transcendence of the physical world. Some traditions of ancient [[Gnosticism]], like the [[Neoplatonism|neo-Platonist]] desert cults, also subscribed to an idea similar to the Platonist ideal of "true knowledge of the Good" being a gateway to transcending one's ordinary, physical existence.

==Foundational gentile existentialism and its connection to Jewish existentialism==
The philosophical school known as existentialism is generally regarded to have begun with the writings of the [[Danish people|Danish]] [[Søren Kierkegaard]] (b. 1813 – d. 1855). Other important thinkers include the [[Germans|German]] [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (b. 1844 – d. 1900), the [[French people|French]] [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] (b. 1905 – d. 1980), and the German [[Martin Heidegger]] (b. 1889-1976). Various Jewish existentialists found influence in the [[secular]] philosophy of existentialism and have made various critiques and commentaries of the above-mentioned writers' works.

Both Judaism and existentialism deny the ability of human beings to permanently transcend the physical world and one's own normal existence. Theistic Judaism insists on a transcendent realm of existence beyond normal human reality, that is, the realm of God. As a way of connecting to God, Judaism directs its adherents towards the strict observance of laws, both ritual and ethical, in order to add meaning to the adherents' lives (see Soloveitchik's [[Halakhic Man]] for a further discussion of the concept of the Jew making meaning in his own life by observing the Halakha). Modern existentialist philosophy often denies the existence of a higher power, leading some to classify it as an agnostic or atheistic thought structure. Martin Heidegger's concept of man's ''thrownness'' into existence in the world&lt;ref name="xi"&gt;Heidegger, Being and Time.&lt;/ref&gt; causing him to be ill at ease/uncomfortable due to his very existence is similar to Hebraic man's "uneasiness" due to his inherently sinful nature. Both senses of being ill at ease in one's own skin are too inherent to the human condition to eliminate, according to Barret.&lt;ref name="xii"&gt;Barret, 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional Jewish thinkers and existentialist thinkers (both Semitic and gentile) have different solutions to this intrinsic uneasiness, also called existential anxiety or existential angst.

Jean-Paul Sartre's book, ''[[Anti-Semite and Jew]]'' (1948), is a direct connection between secular existentialist thought as philosophy and Jewish existentialism as an expression of a religious mode of thinking. Sartre's humanistic argument against antisemitism is that,

{{quote|
"If reason exists, there is no French or German truth...or Jewish truth. There is only one Truth, and he is best who wins it.  In the face of universal and eternal laws, man himself is universal.  There are no more Poles or Jews; there are men who live in Poland, others who are designated as 'of the Jewish faith' or their family papers..."&lt;ref name="xiii"&gt;Sarte, Jean-Paul. Anti-Semite and Jew. New York, NY: Schocken Books, 1948. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Even out of the ashes of the Holocaust, Sartre insists on the supremacy and ultimate victory of rationalism over tribalism and hatred. The anti-Semite's hatred is just a misguided attempt to rid one's society of evil, which is itself a noble aim. Sartre ties his existentialist, universal humanism to Judaism by denying the difference between Jews and others. By denying Jews' "Chosenness" and explaining the Holocaust as a particularly nasty episode of [[utopianism]] gone wrong, Sartre offers hope to Jews worldwide. He insists that tribalism and pure hatred of the Jew as an aberrant outsider are not sources of anti-Semitism. He claims that "If the Jew did not exist, the anti-Semite would invent him."&lt;ref name="xv"&gt;p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  Anti-Semitism is much more a reflection of the basic psychological need for a foreign object of hatred common in many people, according to Sartre. In many cases, this object of hatred for gentiles has been the Jewish people, who have functioned as the "[[Scape goat#The Bible|scapegoat]]" of Europe for many centuries.

==20th century (Pre-WWII) boom==

===Martin Buber===

Perhaps the preeminent Jewish existentialist is the Austrian theologian/philosopher [[Martin Buber]]. Buber wrote extensively on a variety of topics, including Biblical translation, Zionism, Hassidic culture, folklore and his concept of "a [[philosophy of dialogue]]".&lt;ref name="xvi"&gt;Herberg, Will, ed. Four Existentialist Theologians: A Reader from the Works of Jaques Maritain, Nicolas Berdyaev, Martin.155.&lt;/ref&gt; He made a major contribution to Jewish existentialism with his popular 1923 book ''[[I and Thou]]'' (from the German, ''Ich und Du''). The book is concerned with the dual concepts of the "I and You (Thou)" and "I and It" relationship, which is Buber's attempt to answer several age-old existential questions about the meaning of human existence. Buber says that human beings find meaning in their relationships with other entities in the world, whether these are inanimate objects, other people, or even a spiritual force like God. This ''Begegnung'' ("meeting")&lt;ref name="xvii"&gt;Buber, Martin. I And Thou. Trans. Walter Kaufmann. New York, NY: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1970. 46&lt;/ref&gt; between human and object is what gives life meaning for each individual human. Buber goes on to show how human beings define themselves in relation to the other, either the "You" or the "I." He says that one's whole being is made by the relation one has to "The Other" – "When one says You, the I of the word pair I-You is said, too...Being I and saying I are the same."&lt;ref name="xviii"&gt;Buber, 54.&lt;/ref&gt; And also, "The world as experience belongs to the basic word I-It.  The basic word I-You establishes the world of relation."

The latter parts of Buber's ''I and Thou'' are concerned with the possibility for unity of all being. Buber takes a leaf from the book of Judeo-Christian mysticism and Buddhism and explores the concept of the unity of all beings in the universe. Buber admits that as a practicality, and for purposes of life in the real world, "In lived actuality there is not unity of being." Because of Buber's concept of the human being having his existence justified by each new interaction with an 'I' or 'Thou' object, his preferred brand of theology can be seen "not as pantheism, but as [[panentheism]]: not that everything is God, but that God may be in everything..."&lt;ref name="xxi"&gt;Smith, Ronald Gregor. Martin Buber (Makers of contemporary theology). New York: John Knox P, 1975. , 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Buber wrote on a wide variety of topics. He wrote commentary on the socialist [[Zionism|Zionist movement]], classic gentile existentialist writers such as Kierkegaard, [[Dostoyevsky]], and Nietzsche, and Hassidic folklore and culture, among many other topics from a variety of disciplines. In addition to all this, his concepts of the "I and Thou" dialectic and his "philosophy of dialogue" have become standard reading in the realm of positivist existentialist philosophy that seeks to bring meaning to human life. Ronald Gregor Smith writes, "The authentic Jewish note of existential 'realization' is never hard to detect." Buber had an ultimately optimistic view of people's ability to find meaning in life through the Jewish religion.

===Franz Rosenzweig===
[[Franz Rosenzweig]] was a contemporary, colleague, and close friend of [[Martin Buber]].&lt;ref name="xxiv"&gt;Glatzer, Nahum M. Franz Rosenzweig: His Life and Thought. 3rd ed. Schocken Books, 1970. 149-153.&lt;/ref&gt; The two co-wrote a variety of works, including a translation of the Hebrew Bible from the original Hebrew. Rosenzweig's best-known individual work is the epic ''[[The Star of Redemption]]'', a book of modern theology critical of modern philosophical idealism (embodied in Hegel's systematization of human life and thought structure&lt;ref name="xxv"&gt;Rosenzweig, Franz. Star of Redemption. Notre Dame, IN: Notre Dame P, 1985. 130-142.&lt;/ref&gt;) which has had a massive influence on modern Jewish theology and philosophy since its publication in the early 20th century. Rosenzweig proposes an alternative to modern philosophy's systematization of human existence in a paradigm shift from a sterile, removed modern philosophy of idealism and logic to a more Jewish, theistic system, emphasizing the primacy of the relationships between the world, Man (as human being), and God.

===Hans Jonas===
[[Hans Jonas]] was a Jewish scholar of religion and philosophy best known for his definitive work on ancient Gnosticism. His books and papers on Gnosticism and "philosophical biology" are considered an important part of early 20th century scholarship on these subjects.

==Theodicy and post-Holocaust theology==
{{Main|Theodicy#Post-Holocaust}}
The next phase of Jewish existentialism includes a variety of works addressing the horrors of [[the Holocaust]], the term used to denote the German [[Nazi]] party's state-engineered genocide of approximately 6 million European Jews and approximately 11 million other 'undesirables' (including homosexuals, [[Romani people|Romani]], the mentally and physically disabled, Black People, and [[Slavic peoples]]) during World War II.

The paradox of [[theodicy]] has been of interest to theologians and philosophers (Jewish and gentile) for centuries. Theodicy, or the [[problem of evil]], is a branch of theology/philosophy which explores the perceived contradiction of the existence of evil in the world with an all-good, all-knowing, all-powerful (omniscient and omnipotent) God. Talmudists and mystics in the rabbinic tradition explained evil as an absence or distance from God, rather than the opposite of God's all-powerful goodness. Examples include Job complaining to his friends about God causing him suffering, Maimonides' explanation of evil and suffering being the result of man's actions against God rather than God's actions or ill-will towards man,&lt;ref name="xxxi"&gt;Leaman, Oliver. Evil and Suffering in Jewish Theology (Cambridge Studies In Religious Traditions). Cambridge UP, 1997. 80-85.&lt;/ref&gt; and Spinoza's emphasis on the impersonal nature of the universe and the efficacy of human reason in avoiding evil and suffering. Generations of pre-Holocaust Jewish scholars were able to come up with satisfactory explanations for the existence of both evil and an all-powerful, all-good, and infallible God in the universe.

These convenient logical arguments could not provide sufficient solace for a Jewish people emerging from the horrors of the Holocaust. Many scholars contend that the enormous tragedy of the Holocaust represents an entirely new category of evil that one could not explain with traditional Jewish theology. The preeminent survivor-novelist Elie Wiesel (1928-2016) raises a variety of unanswerable questions about the Holocaust in his novels, such as the best-selling ''[[Night (book)|Night]]'' (1958). Many Jews, whether they were survivors or not, experienced a loss of faith in the Jewish concept of God and even in the power of human goodness. Wiesel often repeats the sentiment that "God died in Auschwitz",&lt;ref name="xxxiv1"&gt;Wiesel, Elie. Night. New York: Bantam, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; which may be an allusion to Nietzsche's famous contention that "God is dead", and is representative of the theme of loss of meaning in life for a generation of Jews who experienced and witnessed the Holocaust. However, some Jewish theologians have come up with responses to the Holocaust without denying the existence of God entirely.

===Emil Fackenheim===
[[Emil L. Fackenheim]] was a Reform-movement Rabbi and well-known Jewish theologian who wrote on post-Holocaust theology and coined the term "the 614th commandment".  For Fackenheim, Judaism "attempts to supersede the Holocaust" by founding the State of Israel. The creation of the State of Israel by Jews committed to the renewal of Judaism and the welfare of their fellow Jews and 'the Jewish nation' represents for Fackenheim the emergence of a "muscular Judaism" not present in other generations of Jews.

Fackenheim's best-known work is ''[[To Mend the World: Foundations of Future Jewish Theology]]'' (1982). In it, he coined the term "the 614 commandment" (which he also called the "commanding Voice of Auschwitz"), "forbidding the post-Holocaust Jew to give Hitler post-humous victories".&lt;ref name="xxxvii"&gt;Fackenheim, Emil L. To Mend the World: Foundations of Future Jewish Thought. New York: Schocken Books, 1982. 299&lt;/ref&gt; Fackenheim encountered some criticism for his contention that it is worthwhile to maintain one's Jewish identity solely for the purpose of making sure that Hitler's genocidal plans are not fulfilled after Germany's defeat in World War II.

===Richard Rubenstein===
[[Richard L. Rubenstein|Richard Rubenstein]] is a Jewish theologian whose work on Holocaust theology is considered foundational to the subject.  His basic thesis in his most famous work, ''After Auschwitz: History, Theology, and Contemporary Judaism'' (1966) is that the Jewish conception of God must change in the post-Holocaust era.  According to Rubenstein, Jews can no longer believe in an all-powerful, all-good, and omnipotent God; the contradiction inherent in such a God allowing the Holocaust to occur is too great.  Rubenstein writes about "God's guilt"&lt;ref name="xxxviii"&gt;Leaman, 186&lt;/ref&gt; for allowing the Holocaust to happen.  He affirms God's all-powerful nature, but suggests the possibility that God is not the all-good force of love that rabbinic Judaism has made him out to be. Rather, God may be an all-powerful enemy of the Jewish people, who has damned them to an eternal "Chosenness" of suffering.

Rubenstein also discusses in ''After Auschwitz'' the significant role that Christianity and various Christian churches (for example, the massive and politically powerful institution of the German Catholic church) had in allowing the Holocaust to occur.  Rubenstein makes the point that it was not just the political and social trends of Nazism that allowed the Holocaust to occur; German Christians endorsed Hitler's aims both passively and actively.&lt;ref name="xxxiv2"&gt;Rubenstein, Richard L. After Auschwitz: History, Theology, and Contemporary Judaism. 2nd ed. The Johns Hopkins UP, 1992. 190-192&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional Jewish responses==
Along with the work of secular, agnostic theologians concerned with the national destiny of the Jewish people, there has been a resurgence of religious Jewish thought since the 1950s. Some of the work of observant Jewish scholars is concerned with existentialist themes.

===Abraham Joshua Heschel===
[[Abraham Joshua Heschel]] wrote extensively on Jewish existentialist themes. Among his many works on Jewish theology are the books ''The Sabbath'' (1951) and ''Who is Man?'' (1965).  The best-selling ''The Sabbath'' explores the concept of the Jewish Sabbath (Shabbat) and its significance as a period of heightened connection between God and his creation of Man.  Heschel's ''The Sabbath'' is also well known for the concept of the Shabbat as a "cathedral in time" (rather than in space, as cathedrals are in the Christian tradition).  For Heschel, "The Sabbath arrives in the world... [and] eternity utters a day."

In ''Who is Man?'', Heschel explicates his thesis that Man is a being whose ultimate purpose and task in life is to wonder about existence, to ponder and pine for his Creator.  In his words, "Man is a being in search of significant being, of ultimate meaning of existence."&lt;ref name="xli"&gt;Heschel, Abraham J. Who Is Man? 1st ed. Stanford UP, 1965. 63&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''Who Is Man?'', Heschel also constructs a famous dichotomy between "biblical man" and "ontological man".  Heschel's concept of the "ontological man" is an explicit response to Heidegger's ideas about [[Dasein]],&lt;ref name="xlii"&gt;Heidegger, Martin. Basic Writings: From Being and Time (1927) to The Task of Thinking (1964). Ed. David F. Krell. Harper San Francisco. 48-57&lt;/ref&gt; which for Heschel is a human who merely exists passively, rather than lives actively as human in the world.  A further difference between "biblical" and "ontological" man is that "ontological" man is stuck on basic questions of ontology (the study of the nature of being and existence) and only "seeks to relate the human being to transcendence called being"&lt;ref name="xliii"&gt;Hechel, Who is Man?, 69&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the "biblical man" "realizing that human being is more than being...seeks to relate man to a divine living, to a transcendence called the living God".  Heschel critiques Heidegger's stance toward seeking an understanding of Being as the ultimate reality without reaching out to a higher power while at the same time living actively in the real world (as "biblical man" does), saying,

{{quote|
"...simply to 'surrender to being,' as Heidegger calls upon us to do, he would...reduce his living to being. To be is both passive and intransitive.  In living, man relates himself actively to the world...The decisive form of human being is human living...to bring into being, to come into meaning.  We transcend being by bringing into being—thoughts, things, offspring, deeds."}}

Heschel's work deals with man's relation to God and man's ability to make meaning in his own life through the sanctification of certain traditions, ideas, and time periods.  Heschel's books (especially ''Who Is Man?'') are primarily concerned with the existential question of the purpose and meaning of human life, which is one of the foundational questions of theology concerning the relationship between human beings and God.

Heschel is also reacting to Nietzsche's secular existentialism in ''Who Is Man?''  In reaction to Nietzsche's assertion that man must make meaning for himself by his "[[will to power]]"&lt;ref name="xlvi"&gt;Nietzsche, 159-161&lt;/ref&gt; in an indifferent universe, Heschel cites human being's obsession with finding meaning outside of themselves as evidence of the existence of a higher being.  He says, "To be overtaken with awe of God is not to entertain a feeling but to share in a spirit that permeates all being."&lt;ref name="xlvii"&gt;Heschel, Who Is Man?, 116&lt;/ref&gt; For Heschel, man's proclivity to be in awe of God is an important part of the make-up of all humans.  He can be said to be an "experiential Jew" concerned with the interior experience of God as the primary mode of popular religious experience.  Rabbi Soloveitchik (see above) would call Heschel an "homo religiosus". Heschel is also reacting to Kierkegaard and Nietzsche's secular existentialism in ''Who Is Man?'' Heschel can be said to be an "experiential Jew" or a "homo religious"&lt;ref name="xlviii"&gt;Soloveitchik, 1-10&lt;/ref&gt; ("religious man") "totally devoted and given over to a cosmos that is filled with divine secrets and eternal mysteries".

===Joseph Soloveitchik===
In ''Halakhic Man'', [[Joseph Soloveitchik]] responds to Kierkegaard and Heschel's emphasis on the interiority of religious experience. Both Heschel (an extremely knowledgeable scholar of Judaism who was a rabbi in the mystical Hassidic tradition) and Kierkegaard (who wrote extensively on the internal struggle to know God as the primary mode of religious experience&lt;ref name="l"&gt;Søren Kierkegaard,''Fear and Trembling''&lt;/ref&gt;) would be considered examples of "religious man" for Soloveitchik. In ''Halakhic Man'', Soloveitchik seeks to shift the paradigm of religion from one of "religious experience", consciousness, and interiority (i.e. profound meditations of the nature of the soul, the self, and God) to a more worldly "Lawfulness".  According to Soloveitchik, Halakha (the Jewish code of law) is a better expression of religious identity and passion than the unthinking mysticism and piety of the religious or spiritual human.  After all, Halakhic (lawful) man is motivated by a "passionate love of the truth"&lt;ref name="li"&gt;Soloveitchik, 79&lt;/ref&gt; and all his actions are intended to bring him closer to God and God closer to the world. This more worldly approach to Judaism not only allows the human being to approach God, but also brings God closer to the world. This is because following the ''[[mitzvoth]]'' contained within the ''halakha'' is a positive moral action which improves the world and the person obeying the mitzvoth.

Throughout the book, Soloveitchik often returns to his three-part construction of the "cognitive man", the "religious man", and the "Halakhic man". "Cognitive man" is a modern, scientifically-minded rational human who seeks to rationalize everything and explain occurrences in terms of rule-following natural phenomena. "Religious man" is a mystical believer in divine mysteries and internal ecstatic religious experience. "Halakhic man" takes the analytic, rational nature of "scientific man" and combines it with the love of the divine central to religious man's character.  Halakhic man is also committed to living under God's law.

Kierkegaard says that to love one's neighbor perfectly as Jesus did is "the fulfilling of the law".&lt;ref name="lvi"&gt;Kierkegaard, Søren. Works of Love. New York: Harper Perennial, 1964. 103&lt;/ref&gt;  However, R. Soloveitchik would say in response that "living under the law"  requires much more than "loving the neighbor" and points to a much larger body of law (Jewish Halakha) that gives the Jew the ability to connect to God in a much more concrete way.  In general, Christianity de-emphasizes law and the Torah's commandments, emphasizing faith in God and general morality. Judaism emphasizes law and the Commandments.  Soloveitchik's purpose in writing ''Halakhic Man'' is to explain to the secular Jew and other lay-readers the benefits of Orthodox Judaism's focus on externalized law over internalized faith as a way for humans to add meaning to their own lives and transcend their base humanity.   For the Halakhic man, being religious and spiritual is not about correct mindfulness alone (though this may have its part in the religious experience) but is rather about right action.&lt;ref name="lvii"&gt;Soloveitchik, 105-115&lt;/ref&gt; Right moral action is part and parcel in following God's Halakha, given to the Jews as part of the Torah at Sinai.

A classic example from the book of ''Halakhic Man'' using the law to add meaning to his own life is Soloveitchik's explanation of the religious Jew's reaction to a beautiful sunrise or sunset:

{{quote|
"When halakhic man looks to see the western horizon and sees the fading rays of the setting sun or to the eastern horizon and sees the first light of dawn...he knows that this sunset or sunrise imposes upon him anew obligations and commandments.  Dawn and sunrise obligate him to fulfill those commandments that are performed during the day: the recitation of the morning Shema, tzitzit, tefillin, the morning prayer...It is not anything transcendent that creates holiness but rather the visible reality..."}}

Instead of simply wondering at the beauty and mystery of God's creation as the mystic "religious man" (like Kierkegaard or Heschel), Soloveitchik's "Halakhic man" has rigorous laws to follow for every new natural phenomena and life cycle event he encounters, thereby sanctifying his life and the existence of the universe with each day.  The Halakha is Soloveitchik's answer to the question of how to make a human being's life meaningful.

'''Leo Apostel''' ([[Antwerp (city)|Antwerp]], 4 September 1925 – [[Ghent]], 10 August 1995) was a [[Belgian]] [[philosophy|philosopher]] and professor at the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]] and [[Ghent University]]. Apostel was an advocate of interdisciplinary research and the bridging of the gap between [[exact science]] and [[humanities]].

== Biography ==
Leo Apostel was born [[Antwerp (city)|Antwerp]], Belgium, in 1925. After the second World War he studied [[philosophy]] at the [[Université libre de Bruxelles|ULB]] in [[Brussels]] with [[philosopher of law]] and logician [[Chaïm Perelman]]. He got his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] at the ULB in Brussels in October 1948 with the thesis ''Questions sur l'Introspection''. For another year he stayed there working as an assistant of Perelman.

In 1950-1951 Apostel was a CRB fellow at the [[University of Chicago]] with [[Rudolf Carnap]], and with [[Carl Hempel]] at [[Yale University]]. He took his Ph.D. at the ULB in March 1953 with the dissertation "La Loi et les Causes". In 1955 he went to [[Geneva]] [[Switzerland]] to study with [[Jean Piaget]] at the Centre International d'Epistémologie Génétique. These experiences would influence him for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vub.ac.be/vlaamsestudenteninbrussel/personen/leoapostel.html Leo Apostel (1925 - 1995)], Vrije Universiteit Brussel, 2006. (in Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1955 Apostel lectured [[logic]] and [[philosophy of science]] at the [[Ghent University]] and the ULB for three years. In 1958-1959 he was visiting professor at the [[Pennsylvania State University]], and from 1960 to 1979 professor at Ghent University.

Leo Apostel was awarded the Solvay award for human sciences in 1985 and the [[Arkprijs van het Vrije Woord]] in 1986. The transdisciplinary research department [[Center Leo Apostel]] (CLEA) at the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]] was named after him.

== Work ==
Apostel was an advocate of interdisciplinary research and the bridging of the gap between [[exact science]] and [[humanities]].

He wrote two books about Freemasonry: ''Freemasonry: A Philosophical Essay'' in 1985, and ''Atheïstische spiritualiteit'' in 1998.

His ideas about atheistic religiosity are widely acknowledged.

=== Origins ===
In his book "Oorsprong" (Origin) from 2000 Apostel gives a [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] introduction about the beginning of [[Human|man]], [[life]] and the [[universe]]. This work is part of his project to develop his own scientific metaphysics. The basis for this is the contemporary [[philosophy of science]] and humanities and the existing sciences from physics, astrophysics, biology, geology to anthropology. In this book he first outlines the term metaphysics, then presents an ontology, which results in his own consistent [[world view]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vubpress.be/vubpress_shop/book_info.php?cPath=5&amp;books_id=326&amp;osCsid=069cd413c4848addb1034d48118b15ea Oorsprong: Inleiding tot een metyafysica van het ontstaan van mens, leven en heelal] by Leo Apsotel, retrieved October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apostel wrote about 20 books and 100 articles in Dutch, French and English. Some of his books: 

* Matière et Forme
* Communication et Action 
* Logique et Dialectique

'''Maipayat''' (also spelled Maipayattu) is associated with the emergence of knowledge concerning meditative and prescriptive exercises. Originally recorded late in the [[Vedic period]], in conjunction with [[Vedanta]], and [[Yoga]], is done working from a full-deep yogic breathing, by initiating set movement patterns that nurture creativity and feeds the body with breath energy. This energy is taught in Maipayat to be of the divine energy. The teachings of Maipayat are within many different branches of [[Tantra]], Yoga &amp; Martial Arts. Similar exercises are taught in [[T'ai chi ch'uan|t'ai chi]] although Maipayat exercises more fluid movements while attempting to align the [[chakras]].

Practitioners of Maipayat seek to ritually channel their harvested energy through practical training and development of breath and progressively more intensive rapid movements.

Proponent practitioners report that the method improves body-mind balance and coordination, causes a rejuvenation of spirit, and assists in creative potential. Maipayat, the oldest health art of breathing known from [[History of India|Ancient India]]. It is instructed as a self-healing yoga therapy in [[Ayurveda]], and it also appears in conjunction with Indian martial arts:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The foundation of Kalaripayattu, like all other martial arts, is structured movements called Maipayat, which are based on certain foundational stances drawn from the stances of animals like the elephant, horse, crocodile, boar, fish, peacock, snake and lion. Maipayat practice is associated with a lot of jumping and kicking movements that are typical to the practice of the Kalaripayattu." &lt;sup&gt;ref&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mathew Varghese Cross-Cultural Relations between Dravidian India and Central China: New Evidences from the Tradition of Martial Art [http://www.indianfolklore.org/journals/index.php/ifrj/article/viewFile/100/65]&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent offshoots of Maipayat have been the basis of various transplantations of [[Sūtra|sutras]], such as in the late [[Han dynasty]]  dealing with breath control and mystical concentration. [[Bodhidharma]] is said to have transported to [[China]] in the fifth century, [[Buddhism]] combined with mind, body &amp; breath training in the form of Maipayat.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} In China it customarily utilized [[Taoist]] vocabulary to make the Indian techniques intelligible to the Chinese. It shares many basic principles with [[Qigong]] and [[Chinese martial arts|kungfu]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In modern times, it is proving popular among yoga instructors, dancers, singers and athletes as a tool to improve their energy levels.

Fukuoka was the author of several Japanese books, scientific papers and other publications, and was featured in television documentaries and interviews from the 1970s onwards.&lt;ref name="NHK appearance 1976"&gt;

==Life==
Fukuoka was born on 2 February 1913 in [[Iyo, Ehime]], Japan, the second son of Kameichi Fukuoka, an educated and wealthy land owner and local leader. He attended [[Gifu Prefecture]] Agricultural College and trained as a [[microbiology|microbiologist]] and [[Agricultural science|agricultural scientist]], beginning a career as a research scientist specialising in [[plant pathology]]. He worked at the Plant Inspection Division of the [[Yokohama]] Customs Bureau in 1934 as an agricultural customs inspector. In 1937 he was hospitalised with [[pneumonia]], and while recovering, he stated that he had a profound spiritual experience that transformed his world view&lt;ref name="One-Straw-Rev-Recapitulation-satori-Eng-quote"&gt;1992 {{ja icon}} {{nihongo2|わら一本の革命・総括編「神と自然と人の革命」}} {{en icon}} 1996 translation ''The Ultimatum of God Nature ''The One-Straw Revolution'' A Recapitulation'' -page 2. "In an instant I had become a different person. I sensed that, with the clearing of the dawn mist, I had been transformed completely, body and soul."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Journeying with Seedballs-Bio"&gt;2001 {{ja icon}} {{nihongo2|わら一本の革命　総括編　—粘土団子の旅—}} &amp;#91;(a title translate:) ''The One Straw Revolution: Recapitulation -Journeying [around Earth] with clay seed balls-''&amp;#93; -biographical notes on page 271. {{nihongo|15 May 1937 Awakening in Yokohama city|昭和12年 5月 15日　横浜に於て開悟　自然農法の道一筋}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ramon Magsaysay Award-Bio"&gt;[http://www.rmaf.org.ph/Awardees/Biography/BiographyFukuokaMas.htm The 1988 Ramon Magsaysay Award for Public Service - "BIOGRAPHY of Masanobu Fukuoka"]&lt;/ref&gt; and led him to doubt the practices of modern "Western" [[agricultural science]]. He immediately resigned from his post as a research scientist, returning to his family's farm on the island of [[Shikoku]] in southern Japan.

[[File:Fukuoka-hill.jpg|thumb|Fukuoka's hill in Iyo, Ehime]]
From 1938, Fukuoka began to practise and experiment with new techniques on [[organic farming|organic]] [[citrus]] orchards and used the observations gained to develop the idea of "Natural Farming". Among other practices, he abandoned pruning an area of citrus trees, which caused the trees to become affected by insects and tangled branches. He stated that the experience taught him the difference between nature and non-intervention.&lt;ref name="ecocide.do-nothing.abandonment-Natural Way of Farming"&gt;1975 {{ja icon}} {{nihongo2|自然農法-緑の哲学の理論と実践}} {{en icon}} 1985 translation -updated 1987 ''The Natural Way Of Farming-The Theory and Practice of Green Philosophy'' -pages 132 and 190-216 - page 132 "There is a fundamental difference between nature and the doctrine of laissez-faire or non-intervention. Laissez-faire is the abandoning of nature by man after he has altered it, such as leaving a pine tree untended after it has been transplanted in a garden and pruned, or suddenly letting a calf out to pasture in a mountain meadow after raising it on formula milk."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ecocide.do-nothing.abandonment-One Straw Rev Recap"&gt;1992 {{ja icon}} {{nihongo2|わら一本の革命・総括編「神と自然と人の革命」}} {{en icon}} 1996 translation ''The Ultimatum of God Nature ''The One-Straw Revolution'' A Recapitulation'' -pages 5, 50, 97-8, 206-208 - page 98. "To put it very briefly, my theory is that human knowledge and actions have destroyed nature, and thus, if we abandon them and leave nature to nature, nature will recover on its own. This does not, however, mean nonintervention."&lt;/ref&gt; His efforts were interrupted by [[World War II]], during which he worked at the [[Kōchi Prefecture]] agricultural experiment station on subjects including farming research and food production.

[[File:Iyo-home.jpg|thumb|View from Fukuoka's family home in Iyo, Ehime]]
In 1940, Fukuoka married his wife Ayako, and they had five children together. After [[World War II]], his father lost most of the family lands due to forced redistribution policies of the [[Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers|American occupying forces]] and was left with only three-eighths of an acre of rice land and the hillside citrus orchards his son had taken over before the war. Despite these setbacks, in 1947 he took up natural farming again with success, using no-till farming methods to raise rice and barley. He wrote his first book, ''Mu 1: The God Revolution'', or ''Mu 1: Kami no Kakumei'' ({{nihongo|無〈1〉神の革命}}) in Japanese, during the same year, and worked to spread word of the benefits of his methods and philosophy. His later book, ''The One-Straw Revolution'', was published in 1975 and translated into English in 1978.

From 1979, Fukuoka travelled the world extensively, giving lectures, working directly to plant seeds and re-vegetate areas, and receiving a number of awards in various countries in recognition of his work and achievements. By the 1980s, Fukuoka recorded that he and his family shipped some 6,000 crates of citrus to Tokyo each year, totalling about 90 tonnes.&lt;ref name="Ramon Magsaysay Award-Bio" /&gt;

During his first journey overseas, Fukuoka was accompanied by his wife Ayako, met macrobiotic diet leaders [[Michio Kushi]] and Herman Aihara,&lt;ref name="The Road Back to Nature"&gt;1984 {{ja icon}} {{nihongo2|自然に還る}} {{en icon}} 1987 translation ''The Road Back to Nature: Regaining the Paradise Lost''&lt;/ref&gt; and was guided by his leading supporter and translation editor Larry Korn. They sowed seeds in desertified land, visited the [[University of California]] in [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] and [[University of California, Los Angeles|Los Angeles]], the [[Green Gulch Farm Zen Center]], the [[Lundberg Family Farms]], and met with [[United Nations]] [[UNCCD]] representatives including [[Maurice Strong]], who encouraged Fukuoka's practical involvement in the "Plan of Action to Combat Desertification". He also travelled to [[New York City]] and surrounding areas such as [[Boston]] and [[Amherst College]] in [[Massachusetts]].

In 1983, he travelled to Europe for 50 days holding workshops, educating farmers and sowing seeds. In 1985, he spent 40 days in [[Somalia]] and [[Ethiopia]], sowing seeds  to re-vegetate desert areas, including working in remote villages and a refugee camp. The following year he returned to the United States, speaking at three international conferences on natural farming&lt;ref name="The Road Back to Nature" /&gt; in [[Washington state]], [[San Francisco]] and at the Agriculture Department of the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]]. Fukuoka also took the opportunity to visit farms, forests and cities giving lectures and meeting people. In 1988, he lectured at the [[Indian Science Congress]], state agricultural universities and other venues.

Fukuoka went to [[Thailand]] in 1990 and 1991, visiting farms and collecting seeds for re-vegetating deserts in India, which he returned to during November and December that year in an attempt to re-vegetate them. The next year saw him participate in official meetings in Japan associated with the [[Earth Summit]] in Rio, Brazil, and in 1996 he returned to Africa, sowing seeds in desert areas of [[Tanzania]], observing [[baobab]] trees and jungle country. He taught the making and sowing of clay seed balls in Vietnam during 1995.

He travelled to the [[Philippines]] in 1998, carrying out Natural Farming research, and visited [[Greece]] later that year to assist plans to re-vegetate 10,000 hectares around the Lake Vegoritis area in the [[Pella (regional unit)|Pella regional unit]] and to produce a film of the major seed ball effort. The next year he returned to Europe, visiting [[Mallorca]].

He visited [[China]] in 2001, and in 2002 he returned again to India to speak at the "Nature as Teacher" workshop at [[Navdanya]] Farm and at Bija Vidyapeeth Earth University in [[Dehra Dun]], [[Uttarakhand]] in northern India. On [[Gandhi Jayanti|Gandhi's Day]], he gave the third annual [[Albert Howard]] Memorial Lecture to attendees from all six continents. That autumn he was to visit [[Afghanistan]] with Yuko Honma but was unable to attend, shipping eight tons of seed in his stead. In 2005, he gave a brief lecture at the [[Expo 2005|World Expo]] in [[Aichi Prefecture]], [[Japan]],&lt;ref name="World Expo Aichi Japan 2005 appearance"&gt;{{ja icon}} [http://www.expo2005.or.jp/jp/D0/D4/detail/detail_SA0804GB99901.html World Expo Aichi Japan 2005 appearance] - official web page for his session in 2005 Aug 4. (Japanese only; Retrieved 30 November 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; and in May 2006 he appeared in an hour-long interview on Japanese television network [[NHK]].&lt;ref name="NHK TV dialogue at 93"&gt;{{ja icon}} [http://cgi2.nhk.or.jp/chronicle/list.cgi?q=福岡正信+こころの時代&amp;o=1&amp;np=20&amp;or=d {{Asiantitle|こころの時代～宗教・人生||Spiritual Era ~ Religion・Life|j}}] May 2006 NHK television interview between Fukuoka Masanobu and {{nihongo3||金光寿郎|Kanamitsu Toshio}} on the topic: Journey around the world with Clay seed balls&lt;/ref&gt;

Masanobu Fukuoka died on 16 August 2008 at the age of 95, after a period of confinement in bed and in a wheelchair.

==Natural farming==
{{Main|Natural farming}}

Fukuoka called his agricultural philosophy {{Nihongo||[[:ja:自然農法|自然農法]]|shizen nōhō}}, most commonly translated into English as "[[natural farming]]".&lt;ref name="One–Straw_Translator's_Notes"&gt;{{nihongo3||自然農法-わら一本の革命|Shizen Nōhō: Wara Ippon no Kakumei|1975, in Japanese}}. Translated and reinterpretated in 1978 under the title ''The One-Straw Revolution: An Introduction to Natural Farming''.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also referred to as "the Fukuoka Method", "the natural way of farming" or "Do-Nothing Farming".

The system is based on the recognition of the complexity of living organisms that shape an ecosystem and deliberately exploiting it. Fukuoka saw farming not just as a means of producing food but as an aesthetic and spiritual approach to life,&lt;ref&gt;''Linking foresight and sustainability: An integral approach''. Joshua Floyd, Kipling Zubevich Strategic Foresight Program and National Centre for Sustainability, Swinburne University of Technology&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2017}} the ultimate goal of which was "the cultivation and perfection of human beings".&lt;ref&gt;''Agriculture: A Fundamental Principle'', Hanley Paul. Journal of Bahá’í Studies Vol. 3, number 1, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

The five principles of natural farming are that:&lt;ref&gt;''From the ground up: rethinking industrial agriculture'' by Helena Norberg-Hodge, Peter Goering, John Page, International Society for Ecology and Culture&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2017}}

* human cultivation of soil, [[plowing]] or [[Tillage|tilling]] are unnecessary, as is the use of powered machines
* prepared [[fertilizer]]s are unnecessary, as is the process of preparing compost
* weeding, either by cultivation or by herbicides, is unnecessary; instead, only minimal weed suppression with minimal disturbance should be used
* applications of [[pesticide]]s or [[herbicide]]s are unnecessary
* [[Fruit tree pruning|pruning of fruit trees]] is unnecessary&lt;ref&gt;''Sustainable Agriculture: A Vision for Future'' by Desai, B.K. and B.T.Pujari. New India Publishing, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2017}}

==Clay seed balls==
Fukuoka re-invented and advanced the use of clay seed balls. [[seed ball|Clay seed balls]] were originally an ancient practice in which seeds for the next season's crops are mixed together, sometimes with [[humus]] or [[compost]] for [[microbial]] [[inoculant]]s, and then are rolled within [[clay]] to form into small balls. This method is now commonly used in [[guerilla gardening]] to rapidly seed restricted or private areas.&lt;ref name="Seed Bombs: A Guide to Their Various Forms and Functions"&gt;[http://www.guerrillagardening.org/ggseedbombs.html "Seed Bombs: A Guide to Their Various Forms and Functions. On Guerilla Gardening.org (English)] (Retrieved 25 may 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In 1988, Fukuoka received [[Visva-Bharati University]]'s Desikottam Award&lt;ref name="Japan for Sustainability News"&gt;[http://www.japanfs.org/en/mailmagazine/newsletter/pages/027813.html "Japanese Farmer-Philosopher Masanobu Fukuoka: Natural Farming Greening the Deserts" Japan for Sustainability Newsletter 2006 May. (English)] [http://www.japanfs.org/ja/join/newsletter/pages/027345.html –Japanese page.] (Retrieved 5 January 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[Ramon Magsaysay Award]] for Public Service in the Philippines,&lt;ref name="Ramon Magsaysay Award-Cita"&gt;[http://www.rmaf.org.ph/Awardees/Citation/CitationFukuokaMas.htm "The 1988 Ramon Magsaysay Award for Public Service - CITATION for Masanobu Fukuoka]&lt;/ref&gt; often considered "Asia's Nobel Prize".&lt;ref&gt;The 1988 Ramon Magsaysay Award for Public Service.

In March 1997, the Earth Summit+5 forum in Rio de Janeiro presented him with the Earth Council Award, received in person at a ceremony in Tokyo on 26 May of that year,&lt;ref name="Earth Council Awards Japan 1997 Gov page"&gt;{{ja icon}} [http://www.env.go.jp/press/press.php?serial=23 Earth Council Awards 1997 Japan - Japanese Government Environment department website press release] (Japanese only; Retrieved 30 November 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; honouring him for his contributions to sustainable development.&lt;ref name="Japan for Sustainability News" /&gt;

In 1998, Fukuoka received a grant of US$10,000 from the [[Rockefeller Brothers Fund]], but the grant was returned because his advanced age prevented him from completing the project.&lt;ref name="Rockefeller-$10000"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rbf.org/ramongrant98.html |title="Rockefeller Brothers Fund - 1998 Grants made in 1998" |accessdate=2010-09-22 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030223001409/http://www.rbf.org/ramongrant98.html |archivedate=2003-02-23 |df= }}. "As a contribution toward the publication of a textbook, 'Natural Farming - How to Make Clayballs'."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
[[File:One Straw Revolution.jpg|thumb|left|Book cover of Gurmukhi translation of ''One Straw Revolution'' by Rishi Miranshah]]
In the international development of the [[organic farming]] movement, Fukuoka is considered to be amongst the "five giant personalities who inspired the movement"&lt;ref name="giants"&gt;''The Economics of Organic Farming: An International Perspective'', edited by N. H. Lampkin, S. Padel, p. 12. University of California. CAB International, 1994. {{ISBN|0-85198-911-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with Austrian [[Rudolf Steiner]], German-Swiss [[Bioland|Hans Müller]], [[Lady Eve Balfour]] in the United Kingdom and [[J.I. Rodale]] in the United States.

His books are considered both farming compendiums and guides to a way of life.&lt;ref name="Toyoda 2008-9 Japan Spotlight"/&gt;{{Rp|(1)}}

''The One-Straw Revolution'' has been translated into over 20 languages and sold more than one million copies&lt;ref name="Toyoda 2008-9 Japan Spotlight" /&gt; and Fukuoka has been widely influential, inspiring an international movement of individuals discovering and applying his principles to varying degrees,&lt;ref name="Toyoda 2008-9 Japan Spotlight" /&gt; such as Akinori Kimura,&lt;ref name="Akinori Kimura's Miracle Apples Nature Farming"&gt;[http://imaginepeace.com/miracleapples/ Akinori Kimura's "Miracle Apples"](Retrieved 30 November 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Mas Masumoto]]&lt;ref&gt;Pruning the past, shaping the future: David Mas Masumoto and organic nothingness Chou, Shiuh-huah Serena.

[[Rosana Tositrakul]], a Thai activist and politician, spent a year studying with Fukuoka on his farm. She then organised a visit by Fukuoka to the [[Kut Chum District]] of northern Thailand, which, together with his books, were influential in the rapid and widespread adoption of organic and [[chemical-free]] rice farming in the district.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Criticism==
In the preface to the US editions of ''The One-Straw Revolution'', [[Wendell Berry]] wrote that Fukuoka's techniques are not "directly applicable to 
most American farms," but ultimately concludes that it would be "a mistake to assume that the practical passages of this book are worthless..." suggesting that Natural Farming would require farmers to have fresh eyes and the right kind of concern for their land in order to come up with methods relevant to their own farms.

Fukuoka's techniques have proven difficult to apply, even on most Japanese farms, and have been described as a sophisticated approach despite their simple appearance.&lt;ref name="Kato Nagoya-U" /&gt; In the initial years of transition from conventional farming there are losses in crop yields. Fukuoka estimated these to be 10% while others, such as Yoshikazu Kawaguchi, have found attempting to strictly follow Fukuoka's techniques lead to crop failures and require many years of adaption to make the principles work.&lt;ref name="Kato Nagoya-U"/&gt;

Theodor Friedrich and Josef Kienzle of the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] opined that his rejection of mechanisation is not justifiable for modern agricultural production&lt;ref name="Friedrich and Kienzle"&gt;Friedrich, Theodor and Kienzle, Josef (2008) [http://www.fao.org/ag/ca/CA-Publications/ACSAD%202007.pdf Conservation Agriculture: Impact on farmers’ livelihoods, labour, mechanization and equipment]; in: Stewart, B.I., Asfary, A.F., Belloum, A. Steiner, K., Friedrich, T. (eds): Conservation Agriculture for Sustainable Land Management to Improve the Livelihood of People in Dry Areas; Proceedings of an international workshop, 7–9 May 2007 in Damascus, Syria, Damascus/Syria, pp 25-36.&lt;/ref&gt; and that the system cannot interact effectively with conventional agricultural systems.&lt;ref&gt;Sustainable agriculture and environment: globalisation and the impact of trade liberalisation   Andrew K. Dragun, Clement Allan Tisdell 0 Reviews Edward Elgar, 1999. p.111&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, where Fukuoka had few followers or associates,&lt;ref name="Scheewe 2000 Nurturing the Soil" /&gt; his critics argue that the "inner world and the connection between humans and nature does not, however, exhaust reality" and that he did not give sufficient attention to interpersonal relationships or society.&lt;ref name="Scheewe 2000 Nurturing the Soil" /&gt;

==Family farm recent developments==
{{Importance section|date=June 2017}}
[[File:Iyo.jpg|thumb|Fukuoka's farm land in February 2011]]
Fukuoka's farm in Shikoku was taken over by his son and daughter-in-law in the late 1980s, as Fukuoka reached an advanced age.&lt;ref name="Mr-Fukuokas-life-sons-farm-still-thriving-2004"&gt;{{ja icon}} [http://s-osaka.coop/modules/bulletin/index.php?page=article&amp;storyid=8 Esu Coop Osaka exchange visit to Fukuoka Masanobu's son's family's nature farm] (blog page posted 2004 Dec)&lt;/ref&gt; His grandson also took up farming. Many of the farm's [[iyokan]] and [[amanatsu|amanatsu mikan]] trees remain,&lt;ref name="Toyoda 2008-9 Japan Spotlight"/&gt; although some old iyokan were replaced by new varieties of fruit. Woodlands remain along with orchards, including some areas of wild vegetables still growing amongst them. Some areas of straw-mulched cropping continue to produce grains and vegetables. The farm also features an orchard area of [[Ginkgo biloba|ginkgo]] trees, [[shiitake]] mushroom crops growing on tree logs in shady woodland, and plantings of [[Lime (fruit)|lime]]s, [[grapefruit]]s, [[feijoa]]s, [[avocado]]s and [[mango]]es.&lt;ref name="Mr-Fukuokas-life-farming-sons-farm-now-2007"&gt;{{ja icon}} [http://www.cosmo-oil.co.jp/terre/12/02-03.html Japan's nature model farming for more than 30 years.] TERRE issue No. 12 2007 {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mahoroba-blog-Elder-Fukuoka-story"&gt;{{ja icon}} [http://www.mahoroba-jp.net/about_mahoroba/tayori/oriorino/oriorino200802.htm Elder Mr. Fukuoka meeting again with owner of Mahoroba Natural Foods store] (Japanese only; Retrieved 30 November 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

The farm is now{{When|date=June 2017}} run using some natural farming techniques: no chemicals, no tillage of the land and no use of composting. Other techniques have been changed; the pattern of irrigation is more conventional to reduce conflicts with neighbours. A do-nothing philosophy has been followed on the hilltop surrounding Fukuoka's hut. Here it has become a natural, fruit-bearing forest with minimal intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = In-Between  –  Buddhism and Agriculture II: Hope and Despair on Fukuoka Farm, Iyo|url = http://trentbrown.in.s205663.gridserver.com/buddhism-and-agriculture-ii-hope-and-despair-on-fukuoka-farm-iyo/|website = In-Between|accessdate = 2015-12-10|last = Brown|first = Trent|date = 28 November 2015|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151210221323/http://trentbrown.in.s205663.gridserver.com/buddhism-and-agriculture-ii-hope-and-despair-on-fukuoka-farm-iyo/|archivedate = 10 December 2015|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Contains Indic text}}
'''Matsyendrasana''' ({{lang-sa|मत्स्येन्द्रासन}}; [[IAST]]: ''Matsyendrāsana''), '''Lord of the Fishes Pose''', is an [[asana]] in [[hatha yoga]]. The full form is the difficult '''Paripurna Matsyendrasana''' ({{lang-sa|परिपूर्णमत्स्येन्द्रासन}}), from paripurna, perfected, [[Matsyendra]], one of the founders of hatha yoga, and asana, posture or seat. A common and easier variant is '''Ardha Matsyendrasana''' ({{lang-sa|अर्धमत्स्येन्द्रासन}}, from ardha, half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/485 | title=Half Lord of the Fishes Pose | accessdate=9 April 2011 | publisher=Yoga Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.yogapoint.com/asana/matsyendrasana.html | title=Yoga poses, Ardha Matsyendrasana, Half Spinal Twist: | accessdate=9 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The asana usually appears as a [[sitting|seated]] spinal twist with many variations, and in its half form is one of the twelve basic asanas in many systems of hatha yoga.&lt;ref name=Advaita&gt;{{cite web |title=The Half Spinal Twist - Ardha-Matsyendrasana |url=http://yoga108.org/pages/show/107-ardha-matsyendrasana-the-half-spinal-twist-yoga-posture |work=Hatha Yoga |publisher=Advaita Yoga Ashrama |accessdate=6 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==

The name comes from the Sanskrit words ''ardha'' meaning "half", Matsyendra, one of the founders of [[hatha yoga]],{{sfn|Iyengar|1979|p=273}}&lt;ref name="MaehleGauci2009"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Maehle | first1=Gregor

| date=22 January 2011 | publisher=Greenleaf Book (Distributor) | isbn=978-1-60743-944-8 | page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

One foot is placed flat on the floor outside the opposite leg and torso twists toward the top leg.  The bottom leg may be bent with the foot outside the opposite hip or extended with toes vertically.  The arms help leverage the torso into the twist and may be bound (Baddha Ardha Matsyendrasana) in a number of configurations by clutching either feet or opposite hands.

==Variations==

===Ardha Matsyendrasana I===

In this pose, sit with one leg bent on the ground, the foot tucked in close to the body, and cross the other leg over across the body, the knee raised and bent, and the foot on the ground by the outside of the other leg. Twist the body and grasp the raised knee; or, bring the arm over to press against the raised knee; or clasp the hands behind the back.&lt;ref name="Iyengar Light on Yoga"&gt;{{cite book |last=Iyengar |first=B.

&lt;!--===Ardha Matsyendrasana II===
&lt;ref name="Iyengar Light on Yoga" /&gt;
--&gt;
===Ardha Matsyendrasana III===
From Ardha Matsyendrasana I, the bottom leg moves into Padmasana (Lotus Position) and arms bind by grabbing either foot.&lt;ref name="Iyengar Light on Yoga" /&gt;

== Benefits ==

Ardha Matsyendrāsana allows the spine to be twisted all the way from the base of the spine to the very top.  This asana is said to tone the spinal nerves and ligaments, and improves digestion and also improve liver and pancreas health&lt;ref name="Yogeswar1980"&gt;{{cite book | author=Yogeswar | title=Textbook of yoga | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eRUaAAAAMAAJ | year=1980 | publisher=Yoga Centre| page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Hatha Yoga Pradipika]]'' states&lt;!--in verse 27--&gt; that it increases appetite, destroys diseases, and rouses [[kundalini]] in the body.{{sfn|Iyengar|1979|p=273}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3843">'''Menzan Zuihō''' ({{lang|ja|面山瑞方}}, 1683–1769) was a Japanese [[Sōtō]] Zen scholar and abbot of the Zenjo-ji and Kuin-ji temples active during the [[Edo period|Tokugawa period]]. Born  in [[Ueki, Kumamoto|Ueki]], [[Kyushu]], Menzan was the most influential Sōtō Zen writer of his time and his work continue to influence Sōtō Zen scholarship and practice today.&lt;ref&gt;Heine and Wright, ''Zen Masters'', p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; Menzan's scholarship was part of the Tokugawa movement of returning to original historical sources to revitalize Zen ({{lang|ja|復古}} ''fukko'', "return to the old"), especially the works of [[Dōgen Zenji]]. Before Menzan the works of Dōgen were not widely studied or put into practice, he helped revitalize the Sōtō school by analyzing and building on Dogen's writings. Menzan used Dōgen to promote a reform of the Sōtō sect, which included reforming the monastic code and meditation practice. Due to Menzan's efforts, Dōgen studies now occupies a central position in Sōtō Zen thought.&lt;ref&gt;Rigg, David E. [https://web.archive.org/web/20140822115545/http://shikon.nichibun.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/123456789/925/1/IJ1602.pdf "The Life of Menzan Zuiho, Founder of Dogen Zen",] ''Japan Review'' 16, 67–100&lt;/ref&gt; Menzan wrote to advocate the use of the old [[Song dynasty]] monk's hall system, in which monks ate, slept, and meditated in one large monk's hall, rather than in separate rooms as was commonly practiced in Japan at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Rigg, David E. ''The Life of Menzan Zuiho, Founder of Dogen Zen''.&lt;/ref&gt; Menzan was the most prolific Sōtō zen scholar, having written over a hundred titles of detailed scholarship on monastic regulations, precepts, ordination, dharma transmission and philology.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Heine, Dale S. Wright, Michel Mohr; ''Zen Classics'', p. 252&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rigg, David E. ''The Life of Menzan Zuiho, Founder of Dogen Zen''.&lt;/ref&gt; Menzan was also involved in lecturing to the public and teaching laymen and laywomen meditation practice. One of his most famous works, the Buddha Samadhi (''Jijuyu Zanmai'') is addressed to laypeople and focuses on the teachings of Dōgen.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Heine, Dale S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2737">In [[set theory]], a branch of mathematics, the '''Milner &amp;ndash; Rado paradox''', found by {{harvs|txt|first1=Eric Charles|last1=Milner|author1-link=Eric Charles Milner|first2=Richard|last2=Rado|author2-link=Richard Rado|year=1965}}, states that every [[ordinal number]] α less than the [[Successor cardinal|successor]] ''&amp;kappa;''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; of some [[cardinal number]] κ can be written as the union of sets ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,... where ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is of [[order type]] at most ''&amp;kappa;''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; for ''n'' a positive integer.

==Proof==
The proof is by transfinite induction.  Let ''&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;''  be a limit ordinal (the induction is trivial for successor ordinals), and for each ''&lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;'', let ''&lt;math&gt;\{X^\beta_n\}_n&lt;/math&gt;'' be a partition of ''&lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;'' satisfying the requirements of the theorem.

Fix an increasing sequence &lt;math&gt;\{\beta_\gamma\}_{\gamma&lt;\mathrm{cf}\,(\alpha)}&lt;/math&gt; [[Cofinality|cofinal]] in &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\beta_0=0&lt;/math&gt;.

Note &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{cf}\,(\alpha)\le\kappa&lt;/math&gt;.

Define:

:&lt;math&gt;X^\alpha _0 = \{0\};\ \ X^\alpha_{n+1} = \bigcup_\gamma X^{\beta_{\gamma+1}}_n\setminus \beta_\gamma&lt;/math&gt;

Observe that:

:&lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{n&gt;0}X^\alpha_n = \bigcup _n \bigcup _\gamma X^{\beta_{\gamma+1}}_n\setminus \beta_\gamma = \bigcup_\gamma \bigcup_n X^{\beta_{\gamma+1}}_n\setminus \beta_\gamma = \bigcup_\gamma \beta_{\gamma+1}\setminus \beta_\gamma = \alpha \setminus \beta_0&lt;/math&gt;

and so  ''&lt;math&gt;\bigcup_nX^\alpha_n = \alpha&lt;/math&gt;''.

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{ot}\,(A)&lt;/math&gt; be the [[order type]] of ''&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;''. As for the order types, clearly &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{ot}(X^\alpha_0) = 1 = \kappa^0&lt;/math&gt;.

Noting that the sets &lt;math&gt;\beta_{\gamma+1}\setminus\beta_\gamma&lt;/math&gt; form a consecutive sequence of ordinal intervals, and that each &lt;math&gt;X^{\beta_{\gamma+1}}_n\setminus\beta_\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is a tail segment of &lt;math&gt;X^{\beta_{\gamma+1}}_n&lt;/math&gt; we get that:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{ot}(X^\alpha_{n+1}) = \sum_\gamma \mathrm{ot}(X^{\beta_{\gamma+1}}_n\setminus\beta_\gamma) \leq \sum_\gamma \kappa^n = \kappa^n \cdot \mathrm{cf}(\alpha) \leq \kappa^n\cdot\kappa = \kappa^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Neo-scholasticism''' (also known as '''neo-scholastic [[Thomism]]'''&lt;ref name=:0&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2009/10/thomistic-tradition-part-i.html |author=[[Edward Feser]] |title=The Thomistic tradition, Part I (archived copy) |accessdate=2011-01-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129133527/http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2009/10/thomistic-tradition-part-i.html |archivedate=29 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }} Accessed 27 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; or '''neo-Thomism'''&lt;!--'Neo-Thomism' and 'Neo-Thomist' redirect here--&gt; because of the great influence of the writings of [[Thomas Aquinas]] on the movement), is a revival and development of medieval [[scholasticism]] in [[Roman Catholic]] [[theology]] and [[scholastic philosophy|philosophy]] which began in the second half of the 19th century.

==Origins==
During the medieval period, [[scholasticism]] became the standard accepted method of philosophy and theology. The Scholastic method declined with the advent of [[humanism]] in the 15th and 16th centuries, after which time it came to be viewed by some as rigid and formalistic. "Scholastic philosophy did not, however, completely disappear.  An important movement of Thomistic revival took place during the 16th century and enriched Scholastic literature with many eminent contributions. [[Thomas Cajetan|Thomas de Vio Cajetan]] (1469–1534), [[Gabriel Vásquez]] (1551–1604), [[Francisco de Toledo (Jesuit)|Toletus]] (1532–1596), [[Pedro da Fonseca (philosopher)|Fonseca]] (1528–1599), and especially [[Francisco Suárez]] (1548–1617) were profound thinkers, worthy of the great masters whose principles they had adopted."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Louis Perrier, The Revival of Scholastic Philosophy in the Nineteenth Century'', "Chapter VIII: "Chapter VIII: Forerunners of the Neo-Scholastic Revival," Accessed 1 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, as J. A. Weisheipl [[Order of Preachers|O.P.]] emphasizes, within the [[Dominican Order]] Thomistic scholasticism has been continuous since the time of Aquinas: "Thomism was always alive in the Dominican Order, small as it was after the ravages of the Reformation, the French Revolution, and the Napoleonic occupation. Repeated legislation of the General Chapters, beginning after the death of St. Thomas, as well as the Constitutions of the Order, required all Dominicans to teach the doctrine of St. Thomas both in philosophy and in theology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://domcentral.org/blog/the-revival-of-thomism-an-historical-survey-weisheipl/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927202339/http://domcentral.org/blog/the-revival-of-thomism-an-historical-survey-weisheipl/ |archivedate=2013-09-27 |df= }}  “The Revival of Thomism: An Historical Survey, ” James Weisheipl, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;  A further idea of the longstanding historic continuity of Dominican scholasticism and neo-scholasticism may be derived from the [[list of people associated with the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas]].

In the mid–19th century, interest in Roman Catholic circles in scholastic methodology and thought began once again to flourish, in large part in reaction against the "[[Modernism in the Catholic Church|Modernism]]" inspired by thinkers such as [[Descartes]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], and [[Hegel]], the use of which was perceived as inimical to Christian doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Fergus Kerr, ''Twentieth-century Catholic theologians'', (Blackwell, 2007), p1.&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning and core beliefs of theological Modernism were never tightly defined; in large part, Modernism simply represented that which was attacked by Rome in 1907 as ‘the sum of all heresies’. Moreover, given that Modernism remained the perceived enemy of neo-Scholasticism throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries, there were certainly changes over the decades in what was attacked. Certainly, however, common threads of thought can be detected.  These include (1) the belief that revelation continued up to and including the present day and, therefore, did not stop with the death of the last apostle; (2) the belief that dogmas were not immutable and that ecclesial dogmatic formulas could change both in interpretation and in content; (3) the use of the historical-critical method in biblical exegesis.&lt;ref&gt;See Jürgen Mettepenningen, ''Nouvelle Théologie - New Theology: Inheritor of Modernism, Precursor of Vatican II'', (London: T&amp;T Clark, 2010), p20.&lt;/ref&gt;

For many thinkers, the dangers of Modernism could only be overcome by a complete return to scholastic theology. In particular, Catholic interest came to focus on the 13th-century theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]], whose writings were increasingly viewed as the ultimate expression of philosophy and theology, to which all Catholic thought must remain faithful.&lt;ref&gt;This way of approaching Thomas was itself scholastic in inspiration. The scholastics used a book by a renowned scholar, called [[auctor]], as basic course literature. By reading this book thoroughly and critically, the disciples learned to appreciate the theories of the auctor and, thus, of the problems studied in the whole discipline, in a critical and self-confident way. Scholastic works therefore have a tendency to take the form of a long list of "footnotes" to the works studied, not being able to take a stand as theories on their own.&lt;/ref&gt;

This was particularly vigorous at first in Italy. "The direct initiator of the neo-Scholastic movement in Italy was [[Gaetano Sanseverino]], (1811–1865), a canon at Naples."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Louis Perrier, ''The Revival of Scholastic Philosophy in the Nineteenth Century'', "Chapter IX: The Neo-Scholastic Revival in Italy", {{cite web |url=http://www3.nd.edu/Departments/Maritain/etext/perrier9.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151009074833/http://www3.nd.edu/Departments/Maritain/etext/perrier9.html |archivedate=2015-10-09 |df= }} Accessed 1 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  The German Jesuit J [[Kleutgen]] (1811–83), who taught at Rome, was a particularly influential figure in his defences of pre-modern theology and philosophy, his argument that a theology based upon a post-Cartesian philosophy undermined Catholic doctrine, and his recommendation that the Aristotelian scientific method of Aquinas was the theology the Church now needed.&lt;ref&gt;Fergus Kerr, ‘Thomism’, in ''The Cambridge Dictionary of Christian Theology'', (Cambridge, 2011), p507.&lt;/ref&gt; The Accademia di San Tommaso, founded in 1874, published until 1891 a review entitled ''La Scienza Italiana''. Numerous works were produced by [[Giovanni Maria Cornoldi]] (1822–92), [[Giuseppe Pecci]], [[Tommaso Maria Zigliara]] (1833–93), Satolli (1839–1909), Liberatore (1810–92), Barberis (1847–96), Schiffini (1841–1906), de Maria, Talamo, Lorenzelli, Ballerini, Matussi and others. The Italian writers at first laid special emphasis on the metaphysical features of Scholasticism, and less to the empirical sciences or to the history of philosophy.

Papal support for such trends had begun under Pope [[Pius IX]], who had recognized the importance of the movement in various letters. The dogma of the Immaculate Conception (1854), the [[syllabus of errors|''Syllabus errorum'']] (1864) and the proclamation of papal infallibility (1870) all heralded a move away from Modernist forms of theological thought.&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Mettepenningen, ''Nouvelle Théologie - New Theology: Inheritor of Modernism, Precursor of Vatican II'', (London: T&amp;T Clark, 2010), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important moment for the spread of the movement occurred with Pope [[Leo XIII]]’s [[encyclical]] "[[Aeterni Patris]]", issued on 4 August 1879. ''Aeterni Patris'' set out what would come to be seen as the principles of neo-scholasticism, and provided the stimulus for the donation of increased support to neo-scholastic thought. It called for ‘Christian philosophy to be restored according to the spirit of St Thomas’.

==Key principles==
Neo-scholasticism sought to restore the fundamental doctrines embodied in the scholasticism of the 13th century. The essential conceptions may be summarized as follows:

1. [[God]], [[Actus purus|pure actuality]] and absolute perfection, is substantially distinct from every finite thing: He alone can create and preserve all beings other than Himself. His infinite knowledge includes all that has been, is, or shall be, and likewise all that is possible.

2. As to our knowledge of the material world: whatever exists is itself, an incommunicable, individual substance. To the core of self-sustaining reality, in the [[oak]]-tree for instance, other realities (accidents) are added—size, form, roughness, and so on. All oak-trees are alike, indeed are identical in respect of certain constituent elements. Considering this likeness and even identity, our human intelligence groups them into one species and again, in view of their common characteristics, it ranges various species under one genus. Such is the Aristotelean solution of the [[problem of universals]]. Each substance is in its nature fixed and determined; and nothing is farther from the spirit of Scholasticism than a theory of [[evolution]] which would regard even the essences of things as products of change.

But this statism requires as its complement a moderate dynamism, and this is supplied by the central concepts of [[Entelechy|act]] and potency. Whatsoever changes is, just for that reason, limited. The oak-tree passes through a process of growth, of becoming: whatever is actually in it now was potentially in it from the beginning. Its vital functions go on unceasingly (accidental change); but the tree itself will die, and out of its decayed trunk other substances will come forth (substantial change). The theory of matter and form is simply an interpretation of the substantial changes which bodies undergo. The union of matter and form constitutes the essence of concrete being, and this essence is endowed with existence. Throughout all change and becoming there runs a rhythm of finality; the activities of the countless substances of the universe converge towards an end which is known to God; finality involves optimism.

3.  Man, a compound of body (matter) and of [[soul]] (form), puts forth activities of a higher order—knowledge and volition. Through his senses he perceives concrete objects, e.g. this oak; through his intellect he knows the abstract and universal (the oak). All our intellectual activity rests on sensory function; but through the active intellect (intellectus agens) an abstract representation of the sensible object is provided for the intellectual possibility. Hence the characteristic of the idea, its non-materiality, and on this is based the principal argument for the spirituality and [[immortality]] of the soul. Here, too, is the foundation of logic and of the theory of knowledge, the justification of our judgments and [[syllogism]]s.

Upon knowledge follows the appetitive process, sensory or intellectual according to the sort of knowledge. The [[Will (philosophy)|will]] (''appetitus intellectualis'') in certain conditions [[Free will|is free]], and thanks to this liberty man is the master of his destiny. Like all other beings, we have an end to attain and we are morally obliged, though not compelled, to attain it.

Natural happiness would result from the full development of our powers of knowing and loving. We should find and possess God in this world since the corporeal world is the proper object of our intelligence. But above nature is the order of grace and our supernatural happiness will consist in the direct intuition of God, the beatific vision. Here philosophy ends and theology begins.

==Late-19th-century spread==
In the period from the publication of [[Aeterni Patris]] in 1879 until the 1920s, neo-scholasticism gradually established itself as exclusive and all-pervading.&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Mettepenningen, ''Nouvelle Théologie - New Theology: Inheritor of Modernism, Precursor of Vatican II'', (London: T&amp;T Clark, 2010), p20.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 15, 1879, Leo XIII created the [[Pontifical Academy of St. Thomas Aquinas]], and ordered the publication of the critical edition, the so-called "Leonine Edition", of the complete works of Thomas Aquinas.&lt;ref&gt;Previous critical editions of Thomas’s work had been published before, at Parma in 1852-73, and in Paris in 1871-80, but the Leonine edition, produced under the guidance of [[Tommaso Maria Zigliara]], professor of theology at the ''Collegium Divi Thomae de Urbe'' (the future [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']]), superseded both of these.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Leo XIII increased Thomist studies in his support for the ''Collegium Divi Thomae de Urbe'' (the future [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']]), by founding its Faculty of [[Philosophy]] in 1882 and its Faculty of [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon Law]] in 1896.

Accordingly, the thought of Thomas Aquinas came to be assessed positively in relation to all other ‘modern’ systems of thought. In particular, the Aristotelianism of Thomas was seen in contrast to the thought of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] (itself seen as representative of ‘modern’ thought).&lt;ref&gt;For example, Boutroux thought that Aristotle's system might well serve as an offset to [[Kantism]] and evolution. ''Aristote, Etudes d'histoire et de philosophie'', (Paris, 1901, 202). Moreover, [[Paulsen]], ‘Kant der Philosoph des Protestantismus’, ''Kantstudien'', (1899) and [[Eucken]], ''Thomas von Aquino u. Kant, Ein Kampf zweier Welten'', loc. cit., 1901 declared neo-Thomism the rival of Kantism, and the conflict between them the "clash of two worlds". [[Adolf Harnack]], ''Lehrbuch d. Dogmengesch'', III, 3rd. ed., 327, [[Seeberg]], ''Realencyklopädie f. Prot. Theol. '' 5. v. "Scholastik" and others argued against underrating the value of scholastic doctrine.&lt;/ref&gt; Other ‘modern’ forms of thought, including [[Ontologism]], [[Tradition]]alism, the [[Dualistic_cosmology#In_Christianity|dualism]]{{dn|date=March 2018}} of [[Anton Günther]], and the thought of [[Descartes]], were also seen as flawed in comparison to Thomism.

The movement also spread into other countries. It found supporters in Germany,&lt;ref&gt;Such as [[Kleutgen]] (1811–83) and [[Stöckl]] (1823–95), and the authors of the "Philosophia Lacensis" published at Maria Laach by the Jesuits (Pesch, Hontheim, Cathrein), Gutberlet, Commer, Willmann, Kaufmann, Glossner, Grabmann and Schneid.&lt;/ref&gt; Spain,&lt;ref&gt;Such as Gonzalez (1831–92), Orti y Lara, Urráburu, and Gómez Izquierdo&lt;/ref&gt; the Netherlands,&lt;ref&gt;Such as de Groot&lt;/ref&gt; Belgium,&lt;ref&gt;Such as de San (1832–1904), Dupont and Lepidi&lt;/ref&gt; England,&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Maher, John Rickaby, [[Joseph Rickaby]], Boedder (Stonyhurst Series)&lt;/ref&gt;  Switzerland,&lt;ref&gt;Such as [[Mandonnet]] at Freiburg.&lt;/ref&gt; France,&lt;ref&gt;Such as Farges, Dormet de Vorges (1910), Vallet, Gardair, Fonsegrive and Piat&lt;/ref&gt; Hungary,&lt;ref&gt;Kiss and Pécsi.&lt;/ref&gt; the United States,&lt;ref&gt;Such as Coppens, Poland, Brother Chrysostom, and the professors at the Catholic University (Shanahan, Turner, and Pace).&lt;/ref&gt; Argentina,&lt;ref&gt;[[Julio Meinvielle]] and [[Nimio de Anquín]]&lt;/ref&gt; Mexico,&lt;ref&gt;Garcia&lt;/ref&gt; and Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;Santroul&lt;/ref&gt; In Belgium, a particularly important moment was the establishment by Leo XIII at [[Leuven|Louvain]] (then still a francophone university) in 1891 of the "Institut de philosophie" for the special purpose of teaching the doctrine of St. Thomas together with history and the natural sciences.&lt;ref&gt;The Institute was placed in charge of Mgr (later Cardinal) [[Désiré-Joseph Mercier|Mercier]] whose "Cours de philosophie" was translated into many major European languages.&lt;/ref&gt; It was endorsed by four [[Catholic Congress]]es: Paris (1891); Brussels (1895); Freiburg (1897); Munich (1900).

==Early-20th-century development==
In the early 20th century, neo-Thomism became official Catholic doctrine, and became increasingly defined in opposition to Modernism. In July 1907, Pope [[Pius X]] issued the decree ''Lamentabili sane exitu'', which condemned 65 Modernist propositions. Two months later, he issued the encyclical ''Pascendi Dominici Gregis'', in which he unequivocally condemned the agnosticism, immanentism, and relativism of Modernism as the 'synthesis of all heresies'.&lt;ref name="Hans Boersma 2009 p18"&gt;[[Hans Boersma]], ''Nouvelle Theologie and Sacramental Ontology: A Return to Mystery'', (Oxford: OUP, 2009), p18.&lt;/ref&gt; The anti-Modernist oath of 1910 was very important; this remained in force until 1966. .&lt;ref name="Hans Boersma 2009 p18"/&gt; In 1914, Pope [[Pius X]] acted against Modernism by ordering, though the Sacred Congregation of Studies, the publication of a list of 24 philosophical propositions, propositions summarising the central tenets of neo-scholasticism to be taught in all colleges as fundamental elements of philosophy, which was intended to promote a purer form of Thomism; in 1916, these 24 propositions were confirmed as normative. In 1917, the Church’s new Code of Canon Law (''Codex Iuris Canonici'') insisted that the doctrine, methods, and principles of Thomas should be used in teaching philosophy and theology.&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Mettepenningen, ''Nouvelle Théologie - New Theology: Inheritor of Modernism, Precursor of Vatican II'', (London: T&amp;T Clark, 2010), p25.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomist thought therefore became reflected in the manuals and textbooks widely in use in Roman Catholic colleges and seminaries before [[Vatican II]].

==Variation within the tradition&lt;!--'Strict observance Thomism' redirects here--&gt;==
While writers such as [[Edouard Hugon]], [[Réginald Garrigou-Lagrange]], and [[Henri Grenier]] were maintaining the tradition of the manuals this did not mean that there was no variation or disagreement among thinkers about how best to formulate Thomism, especially in response to contemporary trends. Variation within the tradition of neo-scholastic Thomism is represented by [[Martin Grabmann]] (1875–1949), Amato Masnovo (1880–1955), Francesco Olgiati (1886–1962), and [[Antonin-Dalmace Sertillanges]] (1863–1948).&lt;ref&gt;Battista Mondin's Metafisica di san Tommaso d'Aquino e i suoi interpreti (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;  Authors such as [[Étienne Gilson]], [[Jacques Maritain]], and [[Joseph Maréchal]] investigated alternative interpretations of Aquinas from the 1920s until the 1950s.  Gilson and Maritain in particular taught and lectured throughout Europe and North America, influencing a generation of English-speaking Catholic philosophers.

The growth in historical investigation into Thomas’s thought led some to believe that neo-Thomism did not always reflect the thought of Thomas Aquinas himself. This historically oriented theology was particularly carried out by writers such as [[Étienne Gilson]], [[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], and [[Henri de Lubac]].  At [[Vatican II]], traditional neo-Thomist thought was opposed by such exponents of the ''[[nouvelle théologie]]''.

Many Thomists however continue in the neo-scholastic tradition.  Some relatively recent proponents are treated in Battista Mondin's ''Metafisica di san Tommaso d'Aquino e i suoi interpreti'' (2002), which treats Carlo Giacon (1900–1984), Sofia Vanni Rovighi (1908–1990), [[Cornelio Fabro]] (1911–1995), Carlo Giacon (1900–1984),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/carlo-giacon_(Dizionario-Biografico)/  Accessed 9 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tomas Tyn]] (1950–1990), Abelardo Lobato (1925–2012), Leo Elders (1926–), and Enrico Berti (1935–), among others.  Due to its suspicion of attempts to harmonize Aquinas with non-Thomistic categories and assumptions, neo-scholastic Thomism has sometimes been called "'''strict observance Thomism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;."&lt;ref name=:0/&gt;

Also [[Edward Feser]] in discussing anglophone authors has indicated that proponents of the more traditional Thomist perspective such as [[Ralph McInerny]] foster the possibility of a contemporary revival of neo-scholastic Thomism.&lt;ref&gt;http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2008/11/neo-scholastic-revival.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Feser could be included along with these thinkers and other such as [[Brian Davies (philosopher)|Brian Davies]] as engaging in a contemporary polemic in defense of the traditional system of Thomistic metaphysics in response to modern philosophy.&lt;ref name="Feser"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Thomistic tradition (Part 1)|url=http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2009/10/thomistic-tradition-part-i.html|author=Feser, Edward|date=15 October 2009|accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''The Parable of the Sunfish'''" is an anecdote with which [[Ezra Pound]] opens ''[[ABC of Reading]]'', a 1934 work of literary criticism. Pound uses this anecdote to emphasize an [[empirical]] approach for learning about art, in contrast to relying on commentary rooted in [[abstraction]]. While the parable is based on students' recollections of [[Louis Agassiz]]'s teaching style, Pound's retelling diverges from these sources in several respects. The parable has been used to illustrate the benefits of scientific thinking, but more recent literary criticism has split on whether the parable accurately reflects the scientific process and calls into question Pound's empirical approach to literature.

==The Parable==
[[File:Ezra Pound by E.O. Hoppé in 1920 (LIFE2).JPG|thumb|upright=.50|Ezra Pound in 1920]]
The text of the parable below is excerpted from Pound's ''[[ABC of Reading]]''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
A post-graduate student equipped with honors and diplomas went to [[Louis Agassiz|Agassiz]] to receive the final and finishing touches. The great man offered him a small fish and told him to describe it.

Post-Graduate Student: "That's only a sunfish."

Agassiz: "I know that. Write a description of it."

After a few minutes the student returned with the description of the ''Ichthus Heliodiplodokus'', or whatever term is used to conceal the common sunfish from vulgar knowledge, family of ''Heliichtherinkus'', etc., as found in textbooks of the subject.

Agassiz again told the student to describe the fish.

The student produced a four-page essay. Agassiz then told him to look at the fish. At the end of three weeks the fish was in an advanced state of decomposition, but the student knew something about it.&amp;#8288;&lt;ref name=Pound /&gt;{{rp|17&amp;ndash;18}}
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Context==

===''ABC of Reading''===
Pound opens ''ABC of Reading'' with the following pronouncement:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The proper METHOD for studying poetry and good letters is the method of contemporary biologists, that is careful first-hand examination of the matter, and continual COMPARISON of one 'slide' or specimen with another. No man is equipped for modern thinking until he has understood the anecdote of Agassiz and the sunfish.&lt;ref name="Pound" /&gt;{{rp|17, emphasis in original}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Louis Agassiz.jpg|thumb|upright|Louis Agassiz]]
In the parable, a graduate student is sent to noted biologist [[Louis Agassiz]] to complete his education, and Agassiz asks the student three times to describe a sunfish specimen. The student replies with, in turn, the common name of the fish, a brief summary of the species, and a four-page essay on the species. Agassiz finally tells the student to "look at the fish" and "[a]t the end of three weeks the fish was in an advanced state of decomposition, but the student knew something about it."&lt;ref name="Pound" /&gt;{{rp|18}} The text of the parable itself spans 131 words over sixteen lines and is often reproduced in full when cited.&lt;ref name=Sieburth /&gt;&lt;ref name=Perelman /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mezo /&gt;

Pound contrasts this empiricism against knowledge gained through increasingly abstract definitions. As an example, Pound relates what might happen if a European is asked to define "red". After the initial response that red is a color, Pound imagines asking for a definition of color and having it described in terms of vibration, with vibration then defined in terms of energy, and that successive abstractions eventually reach a level where language has lost its power.&lt;ref name="Pound" /&gt;{{rp|19}} Returning to empiricism, Pound reminds the reader that the progress of science increased rapidly once "[[Francis Bacon|Bacon]] had suggested the direct examination of phenomena, and after [[Galileo]] and others had stopped discussing things so much, and had begun really to look at them".&lt;ref name="Pound" /&gt;{{rp|20}} Pound provides several other examples of the same contrasting ideas throughout the first chapter, ranging over topics as diverse as chemistry, Chinese writing, and [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]. At the end of the chapter he summarizes his argument by claiming abstraction does not expand knowledge.&lt;ref name="Pound" /&gt;{{rp|26}}

===Literary essays===

Pound subsequently refers to the parable in two essays: "The Teacher's Mission"&lt;ref name=EJ /&gt; and "Mr Housman at Little Bethel".&lt;ref name=Criterion /&gt; Both were republished in ''The Literary Essays of Ezra Pound''&lt;ref name=Pound2 /&gt; and reference Agassiz without including details of the parable. "The Teacher's Mission" in particular provides a straightforward explanation of how Pound wished the parable to be interpreted.

===="Mr Housman at Little Bethel"====

In January 1934, Pound published a critique of [[A. E. Housman]]'s ''The Name and Nature of Poetry'' in the ''Criterion''.&lt;ref name=Criterion /&gt; As part of the critique, Pound offers an emendation to Housman's claim that "the intelligence" of the eighteenth century involved "some repressing and silencing of poetry".&lt;ref name=Pound2 /&gt;{{rp|68}} Pound replies that the root cause was the tendency towards abstract statements, which came about in part because eighteenth century authors "hadn't heard about Professor Agassiz's fish."&lt;ref name=Pound2 /&gt;{{rp|68}}

===="The Teacher's Mission"====

Also in 1934, Pound published an essay critiquing existing methods for teaching literature in general and university-level instruction methods in particular.  He identifies the root of the problem as abstraction and uses the word "liberty" as an example of a term where a specific, concrete meaning has been lost. Pound finds this situation "inexcusable AFTER the era of 'Agassiz and the fish'" and demands an approach to general education that "parallels&amp;nbsp;... biological study based on EXAMINATION and COMPARISON of particular specimens."&lt;ref name=Pound2 /&gt;{{rp|60, emphasis in original}}

==Sources==
Louis Agassiz was a Swiss-born scientist at [[Harvard University]] who, by 1896, had established a reputation for "lock[ing] a student up in a room full of turtle-shells, or lobster-shells, or oyster-shells, without a book or a word to help him, and not let[ting] him out till he had discovered all the truths which the objects contained."&lt;ref name=James /&gt; Several students of Agassiz who went on to prominence recorded this rite of passage, including Henry Blake, [[David Starr Jordan]], [[Addison Emery Verrill]], and [[Burt Green Wilder]].&lt;ref name=Clark2 /&gt; American literary critic [[Robert Scholes]] traces the parable's source to two narratives in particular: those of former students [[Nathaniel Shaler|Nathaniel Southgate Shaler]] and [[Samuel Hubbard Scudder]]. Their anecdotes were reprinted in Lane Cooper's ''Louis Agassiz as a Teacher: Illustrative Extracts on his Method of Instruction''.&lt;ref name=Scholes /&gt;{{rp|655–6}} Their separate accounts differ markedly from Pound's: both students provide oral reports with a wealth of detail after being initially forbidden from consulting outside sources.{{clarify|date=December 2012|reason=Where they different from Pound's in that they HAD details or was the CONTENT different?}}

===Shaler's ''Autobiography''===
[[File:Nathaniel Southgate Shaler.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Nathaniel Southgate Shaler]]
[[Nathaniel Shaler]] left his [[humanism|humanist]] studies and joined Agassiz's lab at Harvard University, having already read Agassiz's introductory essay on [[Biological classification|classification]]. His autobiography details his initial interactions with Agassiz. With regard to his first assignment, Shaler recorded that Agassiz brought him a small fish to study with the stipulation that Shaler not discuss it with anyone or read anything on the topic until Agassiz had given him permission. When Shaler asked Agassiz for more explicit instructions, Agassiz replied that he could not be more explicit than saying "[f]ind out what you can without damaging the specimen".&lt;ref name=Shaler /&gt;{{rp|98}} After the first hours, Shaler thought he had "compassed that fish," but despite Agassiz always being "within call" he was not asked to present his conclusions.&lt;ref name=Shaler /&gt;{{rp|98}} During the course of the following week, Shaler recorded the details of "how the scales went in series, their shape, the form and placement of the teeth, etc."&lt;ref name=Shaler /&gt;{{rp|98}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;
At length on the seventh day, came the question "Well?" and my disgorge of learning to him as he sat on the edge of my table puffing his cigar. At the end of the hour's telling, he swung off and away, saying "That is not right."&lt;ref name=Shaler /&gt;{{rp|98}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Shaler concluded Agassiz was testing him to see if he was capable of "doing hard, continuous work without the support of a teacher" and redoubled his efforts, starting from scratch and, over the course of seven ten-hour days, managed to describe the specimen to Agassiz's satisfaction.&lt;ref name=Shaler /&gt;{{rp|99}}

===Scudder's "Look at your fish!"===
[[File:SamuelScudder BSNH 1930.png|thumb|right|upright|Samuel Hubbard Scudder]]
[[Samuel Hubbard Scudder]] recorded a similar experience, first published in 1874 as "Look at Your Fish" in ''[[Every Saturday]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name=Scudder /&gt; Agassiz again starts his new student off with a fish preserved in alcohol and instructs the student to "look at it", and promises "by and by I will ask what you have seen".&lt;ref name=Scudder /&gt;{{rp|2}}{{efn|Contrast Scudder's specific identification of the specimen with Pound's "''Ichthus Heliodiplodokus''".&lt;ref name=Pound /&gt;{{rp|17}} A sunfish might be either a ''[[Lampridae]]'' or a ''[[Molidae]]'', but a ''[[Diplodocus|diplodokus]]'' is something altogether different. Pound's name, which includes the Greek words for "fish" and "sun," when taxonomical names are typically Latinate, is very likely meant as a joke.&lt;ref name="Colangelo" /&gt;}} As opposed to Pound's decomposing sunfish, Scudder's account emphasizes the care taken to keep the specimen in good condition:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I was to keep the fish before me in a tin tray, and occasionally moisten the surface with alcohol from the jar&amp;nbsp;... In ten minutes I had seen all that could be seen in that fish, and started in search of the Professor – who had, however, left the Museum; and when I returned, after lingering over some of the odd animals stored in the upper apartment, my specimen was dry all over. I dashed the fluid over the fish as if to resuscitate the beast from a fainting fit, and looked with anxiety for a return of the normal sloppy appearance. This little excitement over, nothing was done but to return to a steadfast gaze at my mute companion.&lt;ref name=Scudder /&gt;{{rp|2}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Scudder provides the additional detail that "instruments of all kinds were interdicted", including any magnifying glass.&lt;ref name=Scudder /&gt;{{rp|3}} After several hours Agassiz asks for a report and Scudder describes "the fringed [[Gill arches|gill-arches]] and moveable [[Operculum (fish)|operculum]]; the pores of the head, fleshy lips and lidless eyes; the [[lateral line]], the spinous fins and forked tail; the compressed and arched body".&lt;ref name=Scudder /&gt;{{rp|3}} Disappointed, Agassiz informs his student that he has failed to observe "the most conspicuous features of the animal" and commands him to "look again, look again!"&lt;ref name=Scudder /&gt;{{rp|3}} The mortified Scudder is eventually asked to consider overnight what he has seen, and is able to report to Agassiz the following morning that "the fish has symmetrical sides with paired organs", which was the observation Agassiz was looking for.&lt;ref name=Scudder /&gt;{{rp|4}} However, when Scudder then asked what he should do next, Agassiz replied, "Oh, look at your fish!" which Scudder did for another two full days.&lt;ref name=Scudder /&gt;{{rp|4}}

===Cooper's ''Louis Agassiz as a Teacher''===
In 1917, English professor Lane Cooper from [[Cornell University]] published a collection of reminiscences of Agassiz. The book included notes from several notable contributors, including Scudder and Cooper, [[William James]], Professor [[Addison Emery Verrill]] ("[Agassiz's] plan was to make young students depend on natural objects rather than on statements in books"),&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;{{rp|27}} and Professor [[Edward S. Morse]], who wrote that Agassiz's method was "simply to let the student study intimately one object at a time."&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;{{rp|48 (footnote)}} Cooper prefigures Pound's interest by remarking on the "close, though not obvious, relation between investigation in biology or zoology and the observation and comparison of these organic forms which we call form of literature and works of art",&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;{{rp|2–3}} concluding that "We study a poem, the work of man's art, in the same way that Agassiz made Shaler study a fish."&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;{{rp|4}} Critic [[Robert Scholes]] concludes that Pound had access to this book and used the material within it as the source for the parable that opens ''ABC of Reading''.&lt;ref name=Scholes /&gt;{{rp|655–6}}

==Interpretation and criticism==

===Agassiz===
Science historian Mary P. Winsor provides extensive commentary on Agassiz's initial assignments for his students.  The solution to the "riddle",&lt;ref name=Winsor /&gt;{{rp|14}} as she calls it, lies in a similar anecdote given by Agassiz in his ''Essay on Classification'':&lt;blockquote&gt;Suppose that the innumerable articulated animals, which are counted by tens of thousands, nay, perhaps by hundreds of thousands, had never made their appearance upon the surface of the globe, with one single exception:  that, for instance, our Lobster (''[[Homarus americanus]]'') were the only representative of that extraordinarily diversified type,&amp;mdash;how should we introduce that species of animals in our systems?&lt;ref name=Agassiz /&gt;{{rp|5, quoted in &lt;ref name=Winsor /&gt;{{rp|14&amp;ndash;15}}}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;Agassiz provides several potential solutions:  the [[species]] of lobster could have a single [[genus]] "by the side of all the other classes with their orders, families, etc.",{{rp|5}} or a [[family (biology)|family]] with one genus and one species, or a [[class (biology)|class]] with one [[order (biology)|order]] and one genus, etc.  Agassiz concludes a single species is sufficient to derive the entirety of the hierarchy:  at the time, this would have been "a distinct genus, a distinct family, a distinct class, a distinct branch."{{rp|7&amp;ndash;8}}  The point of the sunfish is not observing characteristics that distinguish individuals, species and genus, but rather characteristics that are held in common higher up the taxonomic hierarchy.  Scudder's observation that finally satisfies Agassiz is that the sunfish has bilateral, paired organs; a characteristic that Winsor notes is common to all [[vertebrates]].&lt;ref name=Winsor /&gt;{{rp|14}}

===Pound===
Pound, echoing Cooper, opens ''ABC of Reading'' by stating that the correct method for the study of poetry is "the method of contemporary biologists" and that "No man is equipped for modern thinking until he has understood the anecdote of Agassiz and the fish."&lt;ref name=Pound /&gt; Commentators have summarized Pound's position with the term ''[[empiricism]]'', but have divided over whether the parable endorses or indicts the idea.

The simplest interpretations in scientific writing,&lt;ref name=Whorley /&gt; history of science,&lt;ref name=Clark /&gt; and literary criticism&lt;ref name=Santos /&gt; take the parable at face value, accepting empiricism and observation as legitimate techniques. For example, when writing about [[stellar atmosphere]]s, Dimitri Mihalas states that "it is ''specimens'', not facts, that are the ultimate empirical currency that we must use if we wish to purchase a valid theory" before beginning a discussion of Pound's sunfish.&lt;ref name=Mihalas /&gt;{{rp|emphasis in original}}

Moving from acceptance of empiricism to an understanding of its limitations, Christopher Tilley emphasizes in his comments on "scientific archeology" that Pound's student "was not simply learning about 'reality', the sunfish, but a way of approaching that reality – a discourse bound up in a particular thought tradition (empiricism)".&lt;ref name=Tilley /&gt;{{rp|76}} Robert Scholes reaches a similar conclusion, noting that the student "seems to be reporting about a real and solid world in a perfectly transparent language, but actually he is learning how to produce a specific kind of discourse, controlled by a particular scientific paradigm".&lt;ref name=Scholes /&gt;{{rp|654}}

Author [[Bob Perelman]] takes the suspicion of empiricism one step further in his 1994 ''The Trouble With Genius: Reading Pound, Joyce, Stein, and Zukofsky''. Perelman discusses the parable as one of two anecdotes in ''ABC of Reading'' that frame Pound's discussion of [[Chinese characters#Ideograms|Chinese ideograms]]. The former describes attendance at two hypothetical concerts: one of [[Debussy]] and another of [[Ravel]]. Pound states that a person who attended both concerts knows more about the composers than someone who has only read "ALL of the criticisms that have ever been written of both".&lt;ref name=Pound /&gt;{{rp|24, emphasis in original}} Perelman considers the contradiction between "everyone" and "knowledge" to be the key to Pound's thinking: only a gifted or lucky few are able to apprehend the truth (whether by attending the concert or observing the specimen); the rest can only make do with "a fog of clichés, received ideas, second-hand and second-rate opinions, written darkness."&lt;ref name=Perelman /&gt;{{rp|52}} With regard to the parable, Perelman observes the lack of "scientific institutions, pedagogic procedures, or communicable terminologies" where any mediating written descriptions ("sunfish", "diplodokus") only serve to obscure knowledge. Knowledge ultimately resides within Agassiz rather than the world, and "[w]hat looks initially like a commitment to empiricism has led instead to an authoritarian idealism."&lt;ref name=Perelman /&gt;{{rp|53}}

Two critics have also commented on the parable's implications in describing the nature of knowledge in terms of the decay of Pound's fish. Celeste Goodridge notes that [[Marianne Moore]]'s 1934 review of Pound's ''[[The Cantos|Cantos]]'' uses a detailed metaphor of a grasshopper wing to describe the conversations therein. In Goodridge's opinion, Moore's "microscopic examination" both undercuts the work as well as "pays homage, in its precision, to Pound's reverence for 'the applicability of scientific method to literary criticism.'"&lt;ref name=Goodridge /&gt;{{rp|73}} Goodridge then reproduces the parable in full and comments, "Agassiz teaches Pound that all knowledge is necessarily fragmented and does not constitute a whole."&lt;ref name=Goodridge /&gt;{{rp|74}} Knowledge of the fish cannot begin until decay has commenced, reducing the specimen to its constituent parts.

Peter Nicholas Baker reaches a fundamentally different conclusion. He begins the discussion of the parable by first quoting Pound on the topic of genius:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''The genius can pay in nugget and in lump gold; it is not necessary that he bring up his knowledge into the mint of consciousness, stamp it either into the coin of conscientiously analyzed form-detail knowledge or into the paper money of words before he transmit it.''&lt;ref name=Pound3 /&gt;{{rp|emphasis in original}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Baker finds the most striking feature of the parable to be the absence of description of the fish. Baker asks: "Do readers of this anecdote learn about the fish, or rather about a certain kind of authoritarian teaching practice?"&lt;ref name=Baker /&gt;{{rp|79}} Baker claims that Pound's images of coining metal are just as unrealistic as his ideas regarding science and the scientific method. The reader, following Pound's student, reaches knowledge through intuition alone; the decomposing fish, so far as [[epistemology]] is concerned, has become "transparent".&lt;ref name=Baker /&gt;{{rp|80}}

He is the head of [[Palpung Monastery]].

==Life==
[[File:Palpung in Tibet.jpg|thumb|[[Palpung Monastery]], [[Derge]], [[Tibet Autonomous Region]]]]
Pema Tönyö Nyinje was born in 1954 in the village of Palmey, Palyul, [[Derge]], [[Kham]] into a farming family, the Liyultsang. He was enthroned at the age of 18 months as the 12th Tai Situ by [[Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, 16th Karmapa]]. At the age of 5 he was brought to [[Tsurphu Monastery]]. At the age of six he left Tibet for Bhutan, where King [[Jigme Dorji Wangchuck]] had been a disciple of the 11th Tai Situ. Later he was cared for at [[Rumtek Monastery]] in [[Sikkim]], India, where he received his formal religious training from the 16th Karmapa.

The 16th Karmapa had been raised under the guidance of the 11th Tai Situ. The teacher-disciple relationship has served as a mechanism for the unbroken continuity within the [[Kagyu]] school. [[Chögyam Trungpa]] wrote in his book Born in Tibet: “Tai Situ Rinpoche, who was second in importance in the Karma Kagyu school, had died some years before and no reincarnation had been found. The Karmapa could now tell them where the incarnation had taken place. Everyone rejoiced and started immediately to make the preparations."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shambhala.com/born-in-tibet.html "Born in Tibet, Chögyam Trungpa, Shambala Publications, 1966'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, at the age of 21, Pema Tönyö Nyinje went to [[Ladakh]] at the invitation from Druppon Dechen and stayed there for one year. In 1975, at the age of 22, he assumed his traditional responsibilities by founding Palpung Sherabling Monastery&lt;ref name=shesrabgling&gt;{{cite web|title=shes rab gling|url=http://tbrc.org/#!rid=G3CN1561|website=Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center|publisher=TBRC|accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as his main seat in exile.  In 2000, relics of the 8th Tai Situ were enthroned in a separate temple.

== Activities ==
[[File:DalaiLamaTaiSitu.jpg|thumb|left|Historic visit of the [[14th Dalai Lama]] to Palpung Sherabling Monastery, May 11 and 12, 2015. 12th Tai Situ offering a long-life empowerment to the Dalai Lama.]]
As a Buddhist teacher, the 12th Tai Situ traveled widely, making his first visit to the West in 1981 to [[Kagyu Samye Ling Monastery and Tibetan Centre]] in Scotland and visiting the United States in 1982. Since then, he has extensively traveled throughout North America, Europe and Southeast Asia. His teachings have since been published in nine English books. Further publications followed in the new millennium.

In 1989 Pema Tönyö Nyinje embarked on the Pilgrimage for Active Peace. Its 25 years' jubilee was celebrated in a two-day Peace Conclave that was held in Palpung Sherabling Monastery&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palpung.org/newspage/2014/11/1701/briefe.asp?thereleasedate=2014111701 ''Peace Conclave in Palpung Sherab Ling'']&lt;/ref&gt; with guests and representatives from different World Religions.

Together with the [[Goshir Gyaltsab|12th Goshir Gyaltshap]] Pema Tönyö Nyinje recognised [[Orgyen Trinley Dorje]] as the 17th Karmapa. He also recognized [[Choseng Trungpa]], born on 6 February 1989 in [[Kham]], as the reincarnation of Chögyam Trungpa.

On February 21, 2015, the Tai Situ opened Palpung Sherabling Monastery's newly built shedra, the Buddhist University for Higher Studies, Palpung Lungrig Jampal Ling, in a celebration. On May 11 and 12, 2015, the [[14th Dalai Lama]] visited Palpung Sherabling Monastery&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palpung.org/newspage/2015/03/2201/briefe.asp?thereleasedate=2015032201 ''Historic Visit of H. H. Dalai Lama in Palpung Sherabling]&lt;/ref&gt; in the presence of Jamgon Kongtrul, Khenchen Thrangu and representatives of all the Karma Kagyu monasteries in India, Nepal and Bhutan as well as representatives of the [[Sakya Trizin]], Drikung Kyabgon, and Gyaltshab, in order to crown the completion of Palpung Sherabling Monastery, having exactly the same departments and facilities as [[Palpung Monastery]] in [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] with the Ten Knowledges, a monastery with its monastic community, a Buddhist university, three year retreats for both nuns and monks of the Marpa Kagyu and a Shangpa Kagyu retreat, as well as a reliquary temple with a two-day teaching that was preceded by a long-life empowerment granted by Tai Situpa.

'''Philip Stuart Kitcher''' (born 20 February 1947) is a British philosophy professor who specialises in the [[philosophy of science]], the [[philosophy of biology]], the [[philosophy of mathematics]], the [[philosophy of literature]], and, more recently, [[pragmatism]].

==Early life==
Born in London, Kitcher spent his early life in [[Eastbourne]], East Sussex, on the south coast of the United Kingdom. He went to school at [[Christ's Hospital]], Horsham, West Sussex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ACADEMIC AUTOBIOGRAPHY – PHILIP KITCHER|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~psk16/autobio.htm|website=www.columbia.edu|accessdate=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kitcher|first1=Philip|title=Joyce's kaleidoscope : an invitation to Finnegans wake|date=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0195321022|page=Dedication}}&lt;/ref&gt; He earned his B.A. in Mathematics/History and Philosophy of Science from [[Christ's College, Cambridge]] in 1969, and his PhD in History and Philosophy of Science from [[Princeton University]] in 1974, where he worked closely with [[Carl Hempel]] and [[Thomas Kuhn]].

He is married to [[Patricia Kitcher]]. She is a well known [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] scholar and philosopher of mind who has been the [[Mark Van Doren]] Professor of Humanities at Columbia.

==Philosophy==
Kitcher is best known outside academia for his work examining [[creationism]] and [[sociobiology]]. His works attempt to connect the questions raised in [[philosophy of biology]] and [[philosophy of mathematics]] with the central philosophical issues of [[epistemology]], [[metaphysics]], and ethics.  He has also published papers on [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and other figures in the history of philosophy.  His 2012 book&lt;ref&gt;Kitcher, P. ''Preludes to Pragmatism: Toward a Reconstruction of Philosophy", Oxford University Press, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; documented his developing interest in [[John Dewey]] and a pragmatic approach to philosophical issues. He sees [[pragmatism]] as providing a unifying and reconstructive approach to traditional philosophy issues. He had, a year earlier, published a book outlining a naturalistic approach to ethics, ''The Ethical Project'' (Harvard University Press, 2011).&lt;ref&gt;Mallon, R. Review of Kitcher, P. The Ethical Project, Harvard University Press, October 2011. {{ISBN|0-67-406144-6}} (Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews)&lt;/ref&gt;  He has also done work on the philosophy of [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;Kitcher, Philip (2010). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1189312 "The Climate Change Debates"] ''Science'', 328(5983):pp.1230-1234&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kitcher, Philip (March 25, 2015). [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hY2fZbDb3A "Climate Change: The Hard Problem"] 'Instituto de Investigaciones Filosóficas-UNAM'&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criteria for what constitutes 'good science'===

Kitcher's three criteria for good science are:&lt;ref&gt;pg 46-48 {{cite book
| title = Abusing Science: The Case Against Creationism
| publisher = MIT Press
| isbn = 978-0262110853}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:1.  Independent testability of auxiliary hypotheses
:: "An auxiliary hypothesis ought to be testable independently of the particular problem it is introduced to solve, independently of the theory it is designed to save" (e.g. the evidence for the existence of [[Neptune]] is independent of the anomalies in Uranus's orbit).
:2.  Unification
:: "A science should be unified .... Good theories consist of just one problem-solving strategy, or a small family of problem-solving strategies, that can be applied to a wide range of problems".
:3.  Fecundity
:: "A great scientific theory, like Newton's, opens up new areas of research... Because a theory presents a new way of looking at the world, it can lead us to ask new questions, and so to embark on new and fruitful lines of inquiry... Typically, a flourishing science is incomplete. At any time, it raises more questions than it can currently answer. But incompleteness is no vice. On the contrary, incompleteness is the mother of fecundity... A good theory should be productive; it should raise new questions and presume that those questions can be answered without giving up its problem-solving strategies".

He increasingly recognised the role of values in practical decisions about scientific research&lt;ref&gt;Longino, Helen E. (2002), Science and the Common Good: Thoughts on Philip Kitcher’s Science, Truth, and Democracy, ''Philosophy of Science'', 69, pp. 560–568 ([http://mypages.iit.edu/~schmaus/Science_and_Values/readings/longino1.pdf PDF])&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kuhn and creationism===

Kitcher is the author of ''Abusing Science: The Case Against Creationism''. He has commented on the way [[Creationism|creationists]] have misinterpreted Kuhn:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Thomas Kuhn]]'s book ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' has probably been more widely read—and more widely misinterpreted—than any other book in the recent philosophy of science.  The broad circulation of his views has generated a popular caricature of Kuhn's position.  According to this popular caricature, scientists working in a field belong to a club.  All club members are required to agree on main points of doctrine.  Indeed, the price of admission is several years of [[graduate education]], during which the chief [[dogma]]s are inculcated.  The views of outsiders are ignored.  Now I want to emphasize that this is a hopeless caricature, both of the practice of scientists and of Kuhn's analysis of the practice.  Nevertheless, the caricature has become commonly accepted as a faithful representation, thereby lending support to the Creationists' claims that their views are arrogantly disregarded.&lt;ref&gt;Kitcher, P, 1982, ''Abusing Science: The Case Against Creationism'', p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Appointments==
Kitcher currently teaches at [[Columbia University]] in the [[Columbia University Department of Philosophy|Department of Philosophy]] where he holds an appointment as the [[John Dewey]] Professor of Philosophy. As chair of Columbia's [[Core Curriculum (Columbia College)#Table of Core Curriculum Requirements|Contemporary Civilization]] program (part of its undergraduate [[Core Curriculum (Columbia College)|Core Curriculum]]), he also holds the James R. Barker Professorship of Contemporary Civilization. Before moving to Columbia, Kitcher taught at the [[University of Vermont]], [[Vassar College]], The [[University of Minnesota]], [[University of Michigan]], and for several years at [[University of California, San Diego]] where he held the position of Presidential Professor of Philosophy.

Kitcher is past president of the [[American Philosophical Association]]. In 2002, Kitcher was named a fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], and he was awarded the inaugural Prometheus Prize from the [[American Philosophical Association]] in 2006 in honour of extended achievement in the [[philosophy of science]].
He was elected to the [[American Philosophical Society]] in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amphilsoc.org/blog/election-new-members-2018-spring-meeting "Election of New Members at the 2018 Spring Meeting"]&lt;/ref&gt;

He has trained a number of philosophers of science, including prominent [[Peter Godfrey-Smith]] at the City University of New York Graduate Center, [[Kyle Stanford]] at the University of California at Irvine, [[Michael R. Dietrich]] at the University of Pittsburgh, and [[Bruce Glymour]] at Kansas State University, and [[C. Kenneth Waters]] at the University of Calgary and [[Michael Weisberg]] at the University of Pennsylvania as undergraduates.

His appointments and service have included:

==Etymology==

The name comes from the Sanskrit words "shalabh" which means "grasshopper".

==Description==

It is a back bend, or spine stretch, utilizing the strength of the upper and middle back to lift the weight of the legs as high as possible from a starting position while face down on the floor.  It improves flexibility and coordination and increases strength and stamina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc-of-yoga.com/yogapractice/thelocust.asp|title=Yoga Exercise - Locust Pose (Salabhasana)|publisher=www.abc-of-yoga.com|accessdate=2008-11-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210032301/http://www.abc-of-yoga.com/yogapractice/thelocust.asp|archivedate=10 December 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Structural Yoga Therapy: Adapting to the Individual|first= Mukunda|last= Stiles|publisher=Red Wheel|year= 2000|isbn=1-57863-177-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; it helps to exercise the spine.

'''''Sex, Sin, and Zen: A Buddhist Exploration of Sex from Celibacy to Polyamory and Everything in Between''''' is a book written by [[Zen]] [[priest]] and [[punk rock]] [[bassist]] [[Brad Warner]]. The book is an exploration of sex from a modern Zen Buddhist perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Murphy |first=John L. |title=''Sex, Sin, and Zen'': 25 Years Hardcore: as Punk Bassist, Sexual Seeker, and Zen Student |url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/129943-sex-sin-and-zen-by-brad-warner |work=Pop Matters |accessdate=20 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It alternates between practical chapters and more arcane, conceptual ones.

The book also features an interview with [[porn star]] [[Nina Hartley]] who was raised in [[Berkeley, California]] by two Zen Buddhists.

==Reception==
The book received mostly positive reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tricycle.com/p/2295 |title=Sex, Sin, and Zen |accessdate=May 17, 2012 |publisher=[[Tricycle: The Buddhist Review]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' said of the book, "The subject is as fundamental as the human sex drive, which does not go away as one spends time on the cushion...Kudos to Warner for tackling the subject."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-57731-910-8 |title=Religion review: Sex, Sin, and Zen |accessdate=May 17, 2012 |publisher=[[Publishers Weekly]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book has been seen as being alternatively too positive towards polyamory and too critical of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rotondi |first=James |title=Sex, Sin &amp; Zen: Brad Warner and the Lust for Enlightenment|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/james-rotondi/brad-warner-zen-_b_873882.html|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=20 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Chinese Legalism}}
'''Shen Dao''' ({{zh|c=慎到}}; c. 350{{snd}}c. 275{{nbsp}}BC) was a "[[Chinese Legalist]]" theoretician most remembered for his influence on [[Han Fei]] with regards to the concept of shi 勢 (circumstantial advantage, power, or authority), though most of his book concerns the concept of fa 法 (administrative methods &amp; standards) more commonly shared among "Legalists".&lt;ref&gt;Dao Companion to the Philosophy of Han Fei. Shen Dao’s Theory of fa and His Influence on Han Fei. p49. Soon-ja Yang.&lt;/ref&gt; Compared with western schools, Shen Dao considered laws that are not good "still preferable to having no laws at all."&lt;ref&gt;Dao Companion to the Philosophy of Han Fei. Shen Dao’s Theory of fa and His Influence on Han Fei. p52. Soon-ja Yang.&lt;/ref&gt;

Making use of the term dao without cosmological or metaphysical reference,&lt;ref&gt;Dao Companion to the Philosophy of Han Fei. Shen Dao’s Theory of fa and His Influence on Han Fei. Soon-ja Yang&lt;/ref&gt; the Shenzi serves as noteworthy precursor to both [[Taoism|Taoist]] and [[Han Fei]]. Posthumously, he is also sometimes classified as Taoist,&lt;ref&gt;John Emerson 2012. p.1. A STUDY OF SHEN DAO&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wang Fuzhi]] speculated that the chapter "Essay on Seeing Things as Equal" of the Zhuangzhi was actually written by Shen Dao.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, Chad, "Zhuangzi", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2015 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2015/entries/zhuangzi/&lt;/ref&gt; Compared with the egoist Yang Chu, Shen Dao is characterized by the [[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzhi]] as impartial and lacking selfishness, his great way embracing all things.&lt;ref name="Antonio S p.362"&gt;Antonio S. Cua 2003 p.362, Encyclopedia of Chinese Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually referred to as "Master Shen" ("Shenzi" 慎子) for his writings, very little is known of Shen Dao's life.  An itinerant [[Chinese people|Chinese]] [[Chinese philosophy|philosopher]] from [[State of Zhao|Zhao]], he was probably born about 350{{nbsp}}BC, travelling to the city of Linzi (modern [[Zibo]], [[Shandong]]) in 300{{nbsp}}BC to become a member of the [[Jixia Academy]]. Shen probably left Linzi after its capture by the [[Yan (state)|state of Yan]] in 285{{nbsp}}BC, possibly moving to the [[State of Han|Han kingdom]] and absorbing the "Legalist" tradition there. He died roughly 10 years later.{{sfnp|Knechtges|2014|p=871}}&lt;ref&gt;Julia Ching, R. W. L. Guisso. 1991. p.76. Sages and Filial Sons. https://books.google.com/books?id=ynfrlFZcUG8C&amp;pg=PA76&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text==
Thompson states that the Shenzi was available until the fall of the Tang dynasty, though not in its original edition.&lt;ref&gt;Dao Companion to the Philosophy of Han Fei. Shen Dao’s Theory of fa and His Influence on Han Fei. p48. Soon-ja Yang&lt;/ref&gt; Shen Dao's own original 42 essays have been lost. With only 7 fragments still extant, he is known largely through short references and the writings of others, notably the ''[[Han Feizi]]'' and ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]''. A critical reconstruction of the lost book of Shenzi was made by [[Paul Thompson (sinologist)|Paul Thompson]], and published in 1979 as ''The Shen Tzu Fragments''.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} In 2007, the [[Shanghai Museum]] published a collection of texts written on bamboo slips from the [[Chu (state)|State of Chu]] dating to the [[Warring States period]], including six bamboo slips with sayings of Shenzi.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20120215105445/http://www.ewen.cc/books/bkview.asp?bkid=136537&amp;cid=408155&lt;/ref&gt; These are the only known examples of the text of Shenzi that are contemporaneous with its composition.

[[Xun Kuang]] considered Shen's style grandiose.&lt;ref&gt;Xing Lu 1998. Rhetoric in Ancient China, Fifth to Third Century, B.C.E.. p.187. https://books.google.com/books?id=72QURrAppzkC&amp;pg=187&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statecraft==

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Where there is a scale, people cannot deceive others about weight; where there is a ruler, people cannot deceive others about length; and where there is Fa, people cannot deceive others about one's words and deeds.

[[File:Mold_for_making_banliang_coins.jpg|thumbnail|Mold for making banliang coins]]

Shen Dao espouses an impersonal administration in much the same sense as "Legalist" [[Shen Buhai]], and in contrast with "Legalist" [[Shang Yang]]] emphasizes the use of talent&lt;ref&gt;John S. Major, Constance A. Cook. 2007 p.207. Ancient China: A History. https://books.google.com/books?id=vh8xDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT207&lt;/ref&gt; and the promotion of ministers, saying that order and chaos are "not the product of one man's efforts." He also argued for [[Wu wei]], or the non action of the ruler, along the same lines as Shen Buhai, saying
{{quote| text=The Dao of ruler and ministers is that the ministers labour themselves with tasks while the prince has no task; the prince is relaxed and happy while the ministers bear responsibility for tasks. The ministers use all their intelligence and strength to perform his job satisfactorily, in which the ruler takes no part, but merely waits for the job to be finished. As a result, every task is taken care of. The correct way of government is thus.&lt;ref&gt;L.K. Chen and H.C.W Sung 2015 p.251 Dao Companion to Daoist Philosophy. https://books.google.com/books?id=L24aBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA251&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emerson. Shen Dao: Text and Translation&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However he challenges the Confucian and Mohist esteem and appointment of worthies as a basis of order, pointing out that talented ministers existed in every age. Taking it upon himself to attempt a new, analytical solution, Shen advocated fairness as a new virtue.  Scholar Sugamoto Hirotsugu attributes the concept of Fen, or social resources, later used by the ''[[Guanzi (text)|Guanzi]]'' and ''[[Xunzi (book)|Xunzi]]'', to Shen, given a "dimensional" difference through Fa (measurement, standards, protocol, administrative method), social relationships ("yin") and division. Shen Dao eschews Shen Buhai's administrative method (of appraisal and appointment) in favour of a mechanical distribution ("the basis of fairness") with the invariable Fa apportioning every person according to their achievement.&lt;ref&gt;John Knoblock 1990. p.172. Xunzi: Books 7-16. https://books.google.com/books?id=DNqmAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA172

{{block quote | If one rabbit runs through a town street, and a hundred chase it, it is because its distribution has not been determined... If the distribution has already been determined, even the basest people will not fight for it. The way to control All-under-Heaven and the country lies solely in determining distribution.}}

The greatest function of Fa ("the principle of objective judgement") is the prevention of selfish deeds and argument. However, doubting its long-term viability Shen did not exclude moral values and accepted (qualified) Confucian [[Li (Confucian)|Li]]'s supplementation of Fa and social relationships, though he frames Li in terms of (impersonal) rules.&lt;ref&gt;Masayuki Sato 2003. p.134=135. The Confucian Quest for Order. https://books.google.com/books?id=FXJuJl5XTqAC&amp;pg=PA134
Benjanmin I. Schwartz 1985. p.247. The World of Thought in Ancient China. https://books.google.com/books?id=kA0c1hl3CXUC&amp;pg=PA247&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{block quote | "The state has the li of high and low rank, but not a li of men of worth and those without talent. There is a li of age an youth, but not of age and cowardice. There is a li of near and distant relatives, but no li of love and hate."}}

For this reason he is said to "laugh at men of worth" and "reject sages", his order relying not on them but on the Fa.&lt;ref&gt;Benjanmin I. Schwartz 1985. p.247. The World of Thought in Ancient China. https://books.google.com/books?id=kA0c1hl3CXUC&amp;pg=PA247&lt;/ref&gt;

Linking Fa to the notion of impartial objectivity associated with universal interest, and reframing the language of the old ritual order to fit a universal, imperial and highly bureaucratized state,&lt;ref name="Erica Brindley p.6, 8"&gt;Erica Brindley, The Polarization of the Concepts Si (Private Interest) and Gong (Public Interest) in Early Chinese Thought. p.6, 8, 12-13, 16, 19, 21-22, 24, 27&lt;/ref&gt; Shen cautions the ruler against relying on his own personal judgment,&lt;ref name="Shen Dao's Own Voice 2011. p.202"&gt;Shen Dao's Own Voice, 2011. p.202. Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011&lt;/ref&gt; contrasting personal opinions with the merit of the objective standard, or fa, as preventing personal judgements or opinions from being exercised. Personal opinions destroy Fa, and Shen Dao's ruler therefore "does not show favoritism toward a single person."&lt;ref name="Erica Brindley p.6, 8"/&gt;

{{block quote | When an enlightened ruler establishes [gong] ("duke" or "public interest"), [private] desires do not oppose the correct timing [of things], favoritism does not violate the law, nobility does not trump the rules, salary does not exceed [that which is due] one's position, a [single] officer does not occupy multiple offices, and a [single] craftsman does not take up multiple lines of work... [Such a ruler] neither overworked his heart-mind with knowledge nor exhausted himself with self-interest (si), but, rather, depended on laws and methods for settling matters of order and disorder, rewards and punishments for deciding on matters of right and wrong, and weights and balances for resolving issues of heavy or light...&lt;ref name="Erica Brindley p.6, 8"/&gt;

The reason why those who apportion horses use ce-lots, and those who apportion fields use gou-lots, is not that they take ce and gou-lots to be superior to human wisdom, but that one may eliminate private interest and stop resentment by these means. Thus it is said: 'When the great lord relies on fa and does not act personally, affairs are judged in accordance with (objective) method (fa).' The benefit of fa is that each person meets his reward or punishment according to his due, and there are no further expectations of the lord. Thus resentment does not arise and superiors and inferiors are in harmony.

If the lord of men abandons method (Fa) and governs with his own person, then penalties and rewards, seizures and grants, will all emerge from the lord's mind. If this is the case, then those who receive rewards, even if these are commensurate, will ceaselessly expect more; those who receive punishment, even if these are commensurate, will endlessly expect more lenient treatment... people will be rewarded differently for the same merit and punished differently for the same fault. Resentment arises from this."&lt;ref&gt;Paul R. Goldin, Persistent Misconceptions about Chinese Legalism. p.8-9 https://www.academia.edu/24999390/Persistent_Misconceptions_about_Chinese_Legalism_

A floating seed of the p'eng plant, meeting a whirlwind, may be carried a thousand li, because it rides on the power (shi) of the wind. If, in measuring an abyss, you know that it is a thousand fathoms deep, it is owing to the figures which you find by dropping a string. By depending on the power (shi) of a thing, you will reach a point, however, distant it may be, and by keeping the proper figures, you will find out the depth, however deep it may be.  The [[Book of Lord Shang]]]]

Generally speaking, "[[Chinese Legalism]]" understood that the power of the state resides in social and political institutions, and are innovative in their aim to subject the state to them.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Gernet 1982 p.90.

Han Fei says: 
{{block quote | The reason why I discuss the power of position is for the sake of… mediocre rulers. These mediocre rulers, at best they do not reach the level of [the sages] Yao or Shun, and at worst they do not behave like [the arch-tyrants] Jie or Zhou. If they hold to the law and depend on the power of their position, there will be order; but if they abandon the power of their position and turn their backs on the law, there will be disorder. Now if one abandons the power of position, turns one's back on the law, and waits for a Yao or Shun, then when a Yao or a Shun arrives there will indeed be order, but it will only be one generation of order in a thousand generations of disorder... Nevertheless, if anyone devotes his whole discourse to the sufficiency of the doctrine of position to govern All-under-Heaven, the limits of his wisdom must be very narrow.&lt;ref name="hutton.philosophy.utah.edu"&gt;Eric L. Hutton 2008. p.437 Han Feizi's Criticism of Confucianism and its Implications for Virtue Ethics. http://hutton.philosophy.utah.edu/HFZ.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Used in many areas of Chinese thought, Shih probably originated in the military field.&lt;ref&gt;John Emerson 2012. p. 11. A Study of Shen Dao.&lt;/ref&gt; Diplomats relied on concepts of situational advantage and opportunity, as well as secrecy (shu) long before the ascendency of such concepts as sovereignty or law, and were used by kings wishing to free themselves from the aristocrats.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Gernet 1982 p.92. A History of Chinese Civilization. https://books.google.com/books?id=jqb7L-pKCV8C&amp;pg=PA92&lt;/ref&gt; Sunzi (Art of War) would go on to incorporate Taoist philosophy of inaction and impartiality, and Legalist punishment and rewards as systematic measures of organization, recalling Han Fei's concepts of power (shih) and tactics (shu).&lt;ref&gt;Chen, Chao Chuan an Yueh-Ting Lee 2008 p.12. Leadership and Management in China&lt;/ref&gt;

On the Shih of the Sunzi, relatable to Shen Dao's, [[Henry Kissinger]] says: "Chinese statesmanship exhibits a tendency to view the entire strategic landscape as part of a single whole… Strategy and statecraft become means of 'combative coexistence' with opponents. The goal is to maneuver them into weaness while building up one's own shi, or strategic position." Kissinger considers the "maneuvering" approach an ideal, but one that ran in contrast to the conlicts of the Qin dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Kissinger 2012 p.31. On China&lt;/ref&gt;

Searching out the causes of disorder, Shen Dao observed splits in the ruler's authority.&lt;ref&gt;Masayuki Sato 2003. p.122. The 
Confucian Quest for Order. https://books.google.com/books?id=FXJuJl5XTqAC&amp;pg=PA134&lt;/ref&gt; Shen Dao's theory on power echoes [[Shen Buhai]], referenced by [[Xun Kuang]] as its originator, who says "He who (can become) singular decision-maker can become the sovereign of All under Heaven".&lt;ref&gt;A.C.

For Shen Dao, "Power" (Shih) refers to the ability to compel compliance; it requires no support from the subjects, though it does not preclude this.&lt;ref name="Shen Dao's Own Voice 2011. p.203-205"/&gt; (Shih's) merit is that it prevents people from fighting each other; political authority is justified and essential on this basis.&lt;ref&gt;Shen Dao's Own Voice, 2011. p.200,202. Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Shen Dao says: "When All under Heaven lacks the single esteemed [person], then there is no way to carry out the principles [of orderly government, li 理]…. Hence the Son of Heaven is established for the sake of All under Heaven… All under Heaven is not established for the sake of the Son of Heaven…"&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt;

Talent cannot be displayed without power.&lt;ref name="Chen p.113"&gt;Chen, Chao Chuan an Yueh-Ting Lee 2008 p.113. Leadership and Management in China&lt;/ref&gt; Shen Dao says: "The flying dragon rides on the clouds and the rising serpent wanders in the mists. But when the clouds disperse and the mists clear up, the dragon and the serpent become the same as the earthworm and the large winged black ant because they have lost what they ride."&lt;ref name="Shen Dao's Own Voice 2011. p.203-205"/&gt; Leadership is not a function of ability or merit, but is given by some a process, such as giving a leader to a group.&lt;ref&gt;John Emerson 2012. p. 11. 
A Study of Shen Dao.&lt;/ref&gt; "The ruler of a state is enthroned for the sake of the state; the state is not established for the sake of the prince. Officials are installed for the sake of their offices; offices are not established for the sake of officials…&lt;ref name="Erica Brindley p.6, 8"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Emerson 2012. p.11. A Study of Shen Dao.&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually disregarded by the Fa-Jia, Shen Dao considers moral capability useful in terms of authority. If the ruler is inferior but his command is practised, it is because he is able to get support from people.&lt;ref name="Shen Dao's Own Voice 2011. p.203-205"/&gt; But his ideas otherwise constitute a "direct challenge" to Confucian Virtue.&lt;ref&gt;B.W. Van Norden. 2013 p.49. Han Fei and Confucianism: Toward a Synthesis. Dao Companion to the Han Feizi&lt;/ref&gt; Virtue is unreliable because people have different capacities. Both morality together with intellectual capability are insufficient to rule, while position of authority is enough to attain influence and subdue the worthy, making virtue "not worth going after."&lt;ref&gt;Shen Dao's Own Voice, 2011. p.202-205.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1853">'''Simone Porzio''' (Simon Portius) (1496–1554) was an [[Italy|Italian]] philosopher, born and died in [[Naples]].

==Life==
Like his greater contemporary, [[Pomponazzi]], he was a lecturer on medicine at [[Pisa]] (1546–1552), and in later life gave up purely scientific study for speculation on the nature of man. His philosophic theory was identical with that of Pomponazzi, whose ''De immortalitate animi'' he defended and amplified in a treatise ''De mente humana''. There is told of him a story which illustrates the temper of the early humanistic revival in Italy. When he was beginning his first lecture at Pisa he opened the meteorological treatises of [[Aristotle]]. The audience, composed of students and townspeople, interrupted him with the cry ''Quid de anima'' (We would hear about the soul), and Porzio was constrained to change the subject of his lecture. He professed the most open [[materialism]], denied immortality in all forms and taught that the soul of man is homogeneous with the soul of animals and plants, material in origin and incapable of separate existence.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Simone Porzio was the father of [[Camillo Porzio]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12282">'''Situational [[ethics]]''' or '''situation ethics'''  takes into account the particular context of an act when evaluating it ethically, rather than judging it according to [[moral absolutism|absolute]] [[Morality|moral standards]]. With the intent to have a fair basis for judgments or action, one looks to personal ideals of what is appropriate to guide them, rather than an unchanging universal code of conduct, such as [[Biblical law]] under [[divine command theory]] or the [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] [[categorical imperative]].&lt;ref&gt;"Situation ethics", The [[American Heritage Dictionary]] of the English Language, Fourth Edition (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of situational approaches to ethics include [[existentialism|existentialist]] philosophers [[Jean-Paul Sartre|Sartre]], [[Simone de Beauvoir|de Beauvoir]], [[Karl Jaspers|Jaspers]], and [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark E. Graham, ''Josef Fuchs on Natural Law'', Georgetown University Press, 2002, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically [[Christian ethics|Christian forms]] of situational ethics placing love above all particular principles or rules were proposed in the first half of the twentieth century by [[liberal Christianity|liberal]] theologians [[Rudolf Bultmann]], [[John A. T. Robinson]], and [[Joseph Fletcher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Good Life: Alternatives in Ethics | author=Porter, Burton Frederick | year=2001 | pages=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; These theologians point specifically to ''[[agapē]]'', or unconditional love, as the highest end. Other theologians who advocated situational ethics include [[Josef Fuchs (theologian)|Josef Fuchs]], [[Reinhold Niebuhr]], [[Karl Barth]], [[Emil Brunner]], [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]], and [[Paul Tillich]].&lt;ref name=Fletcher/&gt;{{rp|33}} Tillich, for example, declared that "Love is the ultimate law."&lt;ref&gt;Tillich, ''Systematic Theology'', v. 1, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;

Fletcher, who became prominently associated with this approach in the English-speaking world due to his book (''Situation Ethics''), stated that "all laws and rules and principles and ideals and norms, are only contingent, only valid if they happen to serve love" in the particular situation,&lt;ref name="Fletcher"&gt;{{cite book | title=Situation ethics: The new morality | publisher=Westminster John Knox Press | author=Fletcher, Joseph | year=1997 | location=Louisville, KY | isbn=9780664257613}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|30}} and thus may be broken or ignored if another course of action would achieve a more loving outcome. Fletcher has sometimes been identified as the founder of situation ethics, but he himself refers his readers to the active debate over the theme that preceded his own work.&lt;ref name=Fletcher/&gt;{{rp|33–34}}

==Ethical classification and origin of term==
Situational ethics is a form of [[consequentialism]] (though distinct from [[utilitarianism]] in that the latter's aim is "the greatest good for the greatest number") that focuses on creating the greatest amount of love. Situational ethics can also be classed under the ethical theory genre of "[[proportionalism]]" which says that "It is never right to go against a principle unless there is a proportionate reason which would justify it."&lt;ref&gt;Hoose, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;  [[J. A. T. Robinson]], a situational ethicist, considered the approach to be a form of [[ethical relativism]].

There was an active debate in the mid-twentieth century around situational ethics, which was being promoted by a number of primarily Protestant theologians. The English term "situation ethics" was taken from the German ''Situationsethik''. It is unclear who first coined the term either in German or in its English variant.

==Joseph Fletcher==
[[Joseph Fletcher|Fletcher]] proposed that in forming an ethical system based on love, he was best expressing the notion of "love thy neighbor," which [[Jesus Christ]] taught in the [[Gospels]] of the [[New Testament]] of the Bible. Through situational ethics, Fletcher was attempting to find a "middle road" between [[Legalism (theology)|legalistic]] and [[antinomian]] ethics. Fletcher developed his theory of situational ethics in his books: ''The Classic Treatment'' and ''Situation Ethics''. Situational ethics is thus a [[teleology|teleological]] or [[consequentialism|consequential]] theory, in that it is primarily concerned with the outcome or consequences of an action; the ''end''. Fletcher proposed that loving ends justify any means.&lt;ref name=Fletcher/&gt;

Fletcher outlined his theory in four "working principles" and six "fundamental principles".

===The four working principles===
The following are presuppositions Fletcher makes before setting out the situational ethics theory:

# '''[[Pragmatism]]''': An action someone makes should be judged according to the love influenced in it, so the user must always ask: what is the most loving thing to do? For example, war may not{{snd}} to a situationist{{snd}} be considered the most 'loving' thing and so many are quick to deem it as morally wrong.
# '''[[Relativism]]''': Approaching every situation with a relative mindset and thus opposing legalistic approaches{{snd}} avoid words such as 'never', 'complete' and 'perfect'.
# '''[[Positivism]]''': The most important choice of all in the teachings in 1 John 4:7-12 is "let us love one another because love is from God".
# '''[[Personalism]]''': Whereas the legalist thinks people should work to laws, the situational ethicist believes that laws benefit the people. This forces the user to ask 'who is to be helped?' instead of 'what is the law', stressing the importance of people before laws.

===The six fundamental principles (propositions)===
; First proposition: Only one thing is [[intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsically good]]; namely [[greek words for love|love]]: nothing else at all. ''[[Joseph Fletcher|Fletcher]] (1966, p. 56)''{{snd}} an action is good only in so far as it brings about agape.
; Second proposition: The ruling norm of Christian decision is love: nothing else. ''Fletcher (1966, p. 69)''{{snd}} the most important commandment is to love God and "love thy neighbour".
; Third proposition: Love and [[Justice]] are the same, for justice is love distributed, nothing else. ''Fletcher (1966, p.&amp;nbsp;87){{snd}} asks that one must always have an eye on the intention of an action.
:Justice is Christian love using its head, calculating its [[duties]], [[obligations]], opportunities, [[factors of production|resources]]... Justice is love coping with situations where distribution is called for. ''Fletcher (1966, p. 95)''
; Fourth proposition: Love wills the neighbour's good, whether we like him or not. ''Fletcher (1966, p. 103)''{{snd}} illustrates that agape is not an emotion as it sometimes involves sacrifice, we must thus love not expecting anything in return.
; Fifth proposition: Only [[the ends justify the means|the end justifies the means]], nothing else. Actions only acquire moral status as a means to an end; for Fletcher, the end must be the most loving result. When measuring a situation, one must consider the desired end, the means available, the motive for acting and the foreseeable consequences. '' Fletcher (1966, p. 120)''{{snd}} thus, you must recognise that anything may be done if it brings about the most loving outcome.
; Sixth proposition: Love's decisions are made situationally, not prescriptively. ''Fletcher (1966, p. 134) - nothing is inherently right or wrong, everything should be done according to the most loving thing specific to the situation.''

===Examples===
Fletcher proposed various examples of situations in which the established moral laws might need to be put on hold in order to achieve the greater amount of love. These were based upon real situations.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

====Himself Might his Quietus Make====
{{cquote|I dropped in on a patient at the hospital who explained that he only had a set time to live. The doctors could give him some pills (that would cost $40 every three days) that would keep him alive for the next three years, but if he didn't take the pills, he’d be dead within six months. Now he was [[insured]] for $100,000, [[double indemnity (insurance)|double indemnity]] and that was all the insurance he had. But if he took the pills and lived past next October when the insurance was up for renewal, they were bound to refuse the renewal, and his insurance would be canceled. So he told me that he was thinking that if he didn't take the pills, then his family would get left with some security, and asked my advice on the situation.}}

Pragmatism, positivism, relativism and personalism are the four working principles which mean to be reasonably sure the act you take will work and provide the most loving consequence, accepting Situational Ethics as a matter of faith and not reason, each situation must be relative to love and bring about the most loving result and finally the needs of people come first rather than a set of rules.

====Special Bombing Mission No. 13====
{{cquote|When the [[atomic bomb]] was dropped on [[Hiroshima]], the plane crew were silent. Captain Lewis uttered six words, "My God, what have we done?" Three days later another one fell on [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]. About 152,000 were killed, many times more were wounded and burned, to die later. The next day Japan sued for peace. When deciding whether to use "the most terrible weapon ever known" the [[Harry S. Truman|US President]] appointed an [[Interim Committee]] made up of distinguished and responsible people in the government. Most but not all of its military advisors favoured using it. Top-level scientists said they could find no acceptable alternative to using it, but they were opposed by equally able scientists. After lengthy discussions, the committee decided that the lives saved by ending the war swiftly by using this weapon outweighed the lives destroyed by using it and thought that the best course of action.}}

====Christian Cloak and Dagger====
{{cquote|I was reading "Biblical Faith and Social Ethics",&lt;ref&gt;E. Clinton Gardner, ''Biblical Faith and Social Ethics'', NY:Harper, 1960&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton Gardner's book on a shuttle plane to New York. Next to me sat a young woman of about twenty-eight or so, attractive and well turned out in expensive clothes of good taste. She showed some interest in my book, and I asked if she'd like to look at it. "No", she said, "I'd rather talk." What about? "Me." I knew this meant good-bye to the reading. "I have a problem I'm confused about. You might help me to decide," she explained... There was a war going on that her government believed could be stopped by some clever use of espionage and [[blackmail]]. However, this meant she had to [[seduction|seduce]] and sleep with an enemy spy in order to lure him into blackmail. Now this went against her morals, but if it brought the war to an end, saving thousands of lives, would it be worth breaking those standards?}}

These situations were criticised as being extreme. [[Joseph Fletcher]] agreed that they were, as general guidelines should apply in normal cases, with exceptions for extreme cases.

'''''The Outer Limits''''' is a Canadian-American [[television series]] that originally aired on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]], [[Syfy]] and in syndication between 1995 and 2002. The series is a [[List of old television series that were returned to after years|revival]] of the original ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'' series that aired from 1963–65.

''The Outer Limits'' is an [[anthology series|anthology]] of distinct story episodes, sometimes with a [[plot twist]] at the end. The revival series maintained an anthology format, but occasionally featured recurring story elements that were often tied together during season-finale clip shows. Over the course of the series, 154 episodes were aired. Its stories are described as more [[science fiction]]-based and less [[dark fantasy]] than those of ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]''.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==History==
After an attempt to bring back ''The Outer Limits'' during the early 1980s, it was finally relaunched in 1995. The success of television [[speculative fiction]] such as ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', ''[[The X-Files]]'', and anthology shows such as ''[[Tales from the Crypt (TV series)|Tales from the Crypt]]'' convinced rights holder [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] to revive ''The Outer Limits''. A deal was made with Trilogy Productions, the company behind such cinema hits as ''[[Backdraft (film)|Backdraft]]'' and ''[[Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves]]''. The show would run on the pay-TV channel [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] (Trilogy, a Los Angeles- and Canada-based company, is credited with creating the 1995 series).&lt;ref name=trilogy1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/MGM+Worldwide+Television+and+Trilogy+Entertainment+Group+enter...-a019111727|title=MGM Worldwide Television and Trilogy Entertainment Group enter exclusive, multiyear television deal.|date=1997-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=trilogycanada&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torontoscreenwritingconference.com/speakers |title=Speakers – Toronto Screenwriting Conference |year=2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118191525/http://www.torontoscreenwritingconference.com/speakers |archivedate=January 18, 2012 }}&lt;!-- page gives 2016 speakers --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linkedin.com/pub/pen-densham/9/9bb/393|title=Pen Densham|accessdate=July 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episodes appeared in syndication the following season (the same arrangement as MGM/Showtime series ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' and ''[[Poltergeist: The Legacy]]''). It continued on Showtime until 2001, when [[Syfy|Sci Fi]] quietly took over production for the seventh and final series. As a result, that series, unlike the previous ones, was completely free of any swearing or nudity. It was canceled in 2002, after a total of 154 episodes—far more than the original incarnation of the show.&lt;ref name="GarciaPhillips2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Frank Garcia|author2=Mark Phillips|title=Science Fiction Television Series, 1990-2004: Histories, Casts and Credits for 58 Shows|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pQIDAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA169|date=10 December 2008|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-9183-4|pages=169–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the revived show, the Control Voice was supplied by [[Kevin Conway (actor)|Kevin Conway]]. The new series distanced itself from the "[[Villain of the week|monster of the week]]" mandate that had characterized the original series from its inception; while there were plenty of aliens and monsters, they dramatize a specific scientific concept and its effect on humanity.&lt;ref name="Westfahl2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gary Westfahl|title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Themes, Works, and Wonders|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M_3kNDKhxIcC&amp;pg=PA1193|date=1 January 2005|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-32953-1|pages=1193–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of this include "[[Dark Rain (The Outer Limits)|Dark Rain]]" (biochemical warfare causing worldwide sterility), "[[Final Exam (The Outer Limits)|Final Exam]]" (discovery of practical cold fusion power), "[[A Stitch in Time (The Outer Limits)|A Stitch in Time]]" (a time traveler tinkers with history), as well as two episodes revolving around a human mutation known as Genetic Rejection Syndrome (humans mutating into violent creatures) as a result of an outlawed eugenics attempt to create superior children.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

==Production==
The series was filmed in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]]. Stories by [[Harlan Ellison]], [[A. E. van Vogt]], [[Eando Binder]], [[Larry Niven]], [[Richard Matheson]], [[George R.R. Martin]], [[Stephen King]], and [[James Patrick Kelly]] were adapted.

[[Leslie Stevens]] was a program consultant for the first four seasons (until his death), while [[Joseph Stefano]] served as an executive consultant and later senior advisor throughout the whole series. Stefano also remade his episode "[[A Feasibility Study]]", retitling it "[[Feasibility Study (The Outer Limits)|Feasibility Study]]" for the third season. [[Mark Mancina]] and [[John Van Tongeren]] composed new music different from that of Dominic Frontiere and Harry Lubin. They scored ten episodes for the first season. The musical theme for the modern ''Outer Limits'' series is credited to Mark Mancina and John VanTongeren. However, the same music is used in ''The Ambush'', a theme in the soundtrack of ''[[Dune 2000]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvcrazy.net/tvclassics/Outerlimits |title=The Outer Limits Trivia Facts |accessdate=July 16, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224111651/http://www.tvcrazy.net/tvclassics/Outerlimits/ |archivedate=December 24, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most seasons there was a [[clip show]] that intertwines the plots of several of the show's episodes (see "[[The Voice of Reason (The Outer Limits)|The Voice of Reason]]" for an example). At each [[television commercial|commercial]] interval, the Control Voice can be heard saying "The Outer Limits...please stand by". The voice repeats this phrase upon return from the television ads. The surreal images from the opening are mostly the work of [[Jerry Uelsmann]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

A number of episodes from seasons 1–6 feature nudity and adult content; though originally broadcast uncensored, those episodes have been edited for commercial syndication.

===Tie-in books===
Between 1997 and 1999, a series of books based on the show aimed towards younger readers was published by [[Tor Books]], with author [[John Peel]] penning them. The first book, ''[[The Zanti Misfits]]'', was a loose adaptation of the episode of the same name from the 1963 series, while others were based on other episodes.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.innermind.com/outerlimits/info/olbooks.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==DVD releases==
Six themed DVD anthologies of ''The Outer Limits'', with six episodes each, were released by MGM in the US: ''Aliens Among Us'', ''Death &amp; Beyond'', ''Fantastic Androids &amp; Robots'', ''Mutation &amp; Transformation'', ''Sex &amp; Science Fiction'' and ''Time Travel &amp; Infinity''. These DVDs all contain the original uncut episodes, as originally aired. The ''Aliens'' and ''Sex'' titles were also released by MGM in the UK.

Season 1 was released uncut and with extra features on DVD in the US (MGM, 2005), UK ([[20th Century Fox]], 2007) and Germany (Fox/MGM, 2008). Because sales of the set did not meet expectations no further seasons were released.

In 2010 Canada's [[Alliance Films|Alliance Home Entertainment]] released all seven seasons on DVD. Season 1 mirrored the content of the earlier MGM set, while season 2 was also uncensored, with the exception of one episode, "Paradise".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/reviews/Outer-Limits-New-Season-2/9876|title=Outer Limits, The (New) - Season 2 (CAN) Review - TVShowsOnDVD.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seasons 3–6 all contain numerous censored episodes and are of noticeably poorer visual quality than the first two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/reviewsbyuser.cfm?UserID=czslr4szywji81fg8|title=DVD reviews|author=Gord Lacey|publisher=TVShowsOnDVD.com|accessdate=2012-08-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015183219/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/reviewsbyuser.cfm?UserID=czslr4szywji81fg8|archivedate=2012-10-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/review/R33NIC6WFOUXIZ?ref_=glimp_1rv_cl|title=Customer Review|author=Sparky|publisher=Amazon.com|accessdate=2016-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Season 7 contains the original unedited episodes, as unlike the previous seasons, it was produced with no nudity or swearing.

In 2013 TGG Direct released the seventh season in the US, again unedited but of marginally inferior visual quality than the Alliance season 7 DVDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/review/R269P51XL6DDTG?ref_=glimp_1rv_cl|title=Customer Review|author=Buck Naked|publisher=Amazon.com|accessdate=2016-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 5-disc set is titled ''The Outer Limits: The Complete Final Season'', and in 2014 it was split and re-released as 3-disc ''Volume One'' and 2-disc ''Volume Two'' sets.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

'''Translation''' is the communication of the [[Meaning (linguistic)|meaning]] of a [[source language (translation)|source-language]] text by means of an [[Dynamic and formal equivalence|equivalent]] [[target language (translation)|target-language]] text.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Companion to the English Language'', Namit Bhatia, ed., 1992, pp. 1,051–54.&lt;/ref&gt;  The English language draws a [[terminology|terminological]] distinction (not all languages do) between ''translating'' (a written text) and ''interpreting'' (oral or sign-language communication between users of different languages); under this distinction, translation can begin only after the appearance of [[writing]] within a language community.

A translator always risks inadvertently introducing source-language [[word]]s, [[grammar]], or [[syntax]] into the target-language rendering. On the other hand, such "spill-overs" have sometimes imported useful source-language [[calque]]s and [[loanword]]s that have enriched target languages.  Translators, including early translators of [[sacred text]]s, have helped shape the very languages into which they have translated.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Kasparek]], "The Translator's Endless Toil", ''[[The Polish Review]]'', vol. XXVIII, no. 2, 1983, pp. 84-87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the laboriousness of the translation process, since the 1940s efforts have been made, with varying degrees of success, to [[machine translation|automate translation]] or to [[computer-assisted translation|mechanically aid the human translator]].&lt;ref&gt;W.J. Hutchins, ''Early Years in Machine Translation: Memoirs and Biographies of Pioneers'', Amsterdam, John Benjamins, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the rise of the [[Internet]] has fostered a [[world-wide market]] for [[translation services]] and has facilitated "[[language localization]]".&lt;ref&gt;M. Snell-Hornby, ''The Turns of Translation Studies: New Paradigms or Shifting Viewpoints?'', Philadelphia, John Benjamins, 2006, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Rosetta Stone BW.jpeg|thumb|115px|left|[[Rosetta Stone]], a [[secular icon]] for the art of translation.&lt;ref&gt;"Rosetta Stone", ''The Columbia Encyclopedia'', 5th ed., 1994, p. 2,361.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[English language|English]] word "translation" derives from the [[Latin]] word ''translatio'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vélez|first1=Fabio|title=Antes de Babel|pages=3–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; which comes from ''[[Wiktionary:trans#Latin|trans]]'', "across" + ''[[Wiktionary:fero#Latin|ferre]]'', "to carry" or "to bring" (''-latio'' in turn coming from ''latus'', the [[past participle]] of ''ferre'').  Thus ''translatio'' is "a carrying across" or "a bringing across":  in this case, of a text from one language to another.&lt;ref name="The Translator p. 83"&gt;[[Christopher Kasparek]], "The Translator's Endless Toil", p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Germanic languages]] (except for modern [[Dutch language|Dutch]]) and some [[Slavic languages]] have [[calque#Loan translation: translatio and traductio|calque]]d their words for the [[concept]] of "translation" on ''translatio''.&lt;ref name="The Translator p. 83"/&gt;

The [[Romance languages]] and the remaining ''Slavic'' languages have derived their words for the concept of "translation" from an alternative Latin word, ''traductio'', itself derived from ''traducere'' ("to lead across" or "to bring across", from ''trans'', "across" + ''[[Wiktionary:duco#Latin|ducere]]'', "to lead" or "to bring").&lt;ref name="The Translator p. 83"/&gt;

The [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] term for "translation", {{lang|grc|μετάφρασις}} (''metaphrasis'', "a speaking across"), has supplied [[English language|English]] with "[[metaphrase]]" (a "[[literal translation|literal]]", or "word-for-word", translation)—as contrasted with "[[paraphrase]]" ("a saying in other words", from  {{lang|grc|παράφρασις}}, ''paraphrasis'').&lt;ref name="The Translator p. 83" /&gt; "Metaphrase" corresponds, in one of the more recent terminologies, to "[[Translation#Equivalence|formal equivalence]]"; and "paraphrase", to "[[Translation#Equivalence|dynamic equivalence]]".&lt;ref name="Kasparek p. 84"&gt;Kasparek, "The Translator's Endless Toil", p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Strictly speaking, the concept of metaphrase—of "word-for-word translation"—is an [[Perfection|imperfect]] concept, because a given word in a given language often carries more than one meaning; and because a similar given meaning may often be represented in a given language by more than one word.  Nevertheless, "metaphrase" and "paraphrase" may be useful as ''ideal'' concepts that mark the extremes in the spectrum of possible approaches to translation.{{efn|"Ideal concepts" are useful as well in other fields, such as [[physics]] and [[chemistry]], which include the concepts of perfectly solid bodies, perfectly rigid bodies, perfectly plastic bodies, perfectly black bodies, perfect crystals, perfect fluids, and perfect gases.&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], ''On Perfection'' (first published in Polish in 1976 as ''O doskonałości''); English translation by [[Christopher Kasparek]] subsequently serialized in 1979–1981 in ''Dialectics and Humanism:  The Polish Philosophical Quarterly'', and reprinted in [[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], ''On Perfection'', Warsaw University Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Theories==

===Western theory===
[[File:John Dryden by Sir Godfrey Kneller, Bt.jpg|thumb|125px|[[John Dryden]]]]
Discussions of the theory and practice of translation reach back into [[ancient history|antiquity]] and show remarkable continuities. The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] distinguished between ''[[metaphrase]]'' ([[literal translation]]) and ''[[paraphrase]]''. This distinction was adopted by English [[poet]] and [[translator]] [[John Dryden]] (1631–1700), who described translation as the judicious blending of these two modes of phrasing when selecting, in the target language, "counterparts," or [[Dynamic and formal equivalence|equivalents]], for the expressions used in the source language:

{{blockquote|When [words] appear... literally graceful, it were an injury to the author that they should be changed. But since... what is beautiful in one [language] is often barbarous, nay sometimes nonsense, in another, it would be unreasonable to limit a translator to the narrow compass of his author's words: 'tis enough if he choose out some expression which does not vitiate the sense.&lt;ref name="The Translator p. 83"/&gt;}}

[[File:Cicero - Musei Capitolini.JPG|thumb|left|125px|[[Cicero]]]]
Dryden cautioned, however, against the license of "imitation", i.e., of adapted translation: "When a painter copies from the life... he has no privilege to alter features and lineaments..."&lt;ref name="Kasparek p. 84"/&gt;

This general formulation of the central concept of translation—[[Dynamic and formal equivalence|equivalence]]—is as adequate as any that has been proposed since [[Cicero]] and [[Horace]], who, in 1st-century-BCE [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], famously and literally cautioned against translating "word for word" ({{lang|la|verbum pro verbo}}).&lt;ref name="Kasparek p. 84"/&gt;

Despite occasional theoretical diversity, the actual ''practice'' of translation has hardly changed since [[ancient history|antiquity]]. Except for some extreme [[metaphrase]]rs in the early [[Christian]] period and the [[Middle Ages]], and adapters in various periods (especially pre-Classical Rome, and the 18th century), translators have generally shown prudent flexibility in seeking [[Dynamic and formal equivalence|equivalents]]—"[[literal translation|literal]]" where possible, [[paraphrase|paraphrastic]] where necessary—for the original [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] and other crucial "values" (e.g., [[Style (fiction)|style]], [[verse form]], concordance with [[music]]al accompaniment or, in [[film]]s, with speech [[Manner of articulation|articulatory]] movements) as determined from context.&lt;ref name="Kasparek p. 84"/&gt;

[[File:Samuel Johnson by Joshua Reynolds 2.png|thumb|100px|[[Samuel Johnson]]]]
In general, translators have sought to preserve the [[Context (language use)|context]] itself by reproducing the original order of [[sememe]]s, and hence [[word order]]—when necessary, reinterpreting the actual [[grammar|grammatical]] structure, for example, by shifting from [[active voice|active]] to [[passive voice]], or ''vice versa''. The grammatical differences between "fixed-word-order" [[language]]s&lt;ref&gt;Typically, [[analytic language]]s.&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g. [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]]) and "free-word-order" languages&lt;ref&gt;Typically, [[synthetic language]]s.&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Latin]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Russian language|Russian]]) have been no impediment in this regard.&lt;ref name="Kasparek p. 84"/&gt;  The particular [[syntax]] (sentence-structure) characteristics of a text's source language are adjusted to the syntactic requirements of the target language. 
[[File:Martin Luther, 1529.jpg|thumb|left|110px|[[Martin Luther]]]]
When a target language has lacked [[terminology|terms]] that are found in a source language, translators have borrowed those terms, thereby enriching the target language. Thanks in great measure to the exchange of [[calque]]s and [[loanword]]s between languages, and to their importation from other languages, there are few [[concept]]s that are "[[untranslatability|untranslatable]]" among the modern European languages.&lt;ref name="Kasparek p. 84"/&gt;  A greater problem, however, is translating terms relating to cultural concepts that have no equivalent in the target language.&lt;ref&gt;Some examples of this are described in the article, [http://www.noproblem.no/translate.html "Translating the 17th of May into English and other horror stories"], retrieved 2010-04-15.&lt;/ref&gt;  For full comprehension, such situations require the provision of a [[gloss (annotation)#In linguistics|gloss]].

Generally, the greater the contact and exchange that have existed between two languages, or between those languages and a third one, the greater is the ratio of [[metaphrase]] to [[paraphrase]] that may be used in translating among them. However, due to shifts in [[ecological niche]]s of words, a common [[etymology]] is sometimes misleading as a guide to current meaning in one or the other language. For example, the English ''actual'' should not be confused with the [[cognate]] French {{lang|fr|actuel}} ("present", "current"), the Polish {{lang|pl|aktualny}} ("present", "current," "topical", "timely", "feasible"),&lt;ref name="Kasparek p. 85"&gt;Kasparek, "The Translator's Endless Toil", p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; the Swedish ''aktuell'' ("topical", "presently of importance"), the Russian {{lang|ru|актуальный}} ("urgent", "topical") or the Dutch ''actueel'' ("current").

The translator's role as a bridge for "carrying across" values between cultures has been discussed at least since [[Terence]], the 2nd-century-BCE Roman adapter of Greek comedies. The translator's role is, however, by no means a passive, mechanical one, and so has also been compared to that of an [[artist]].  The main ground seems to be the concept of parallel creation found in critics such as [[Cicero]]. [[John Dryden|Dryden]] observed that "Translation is a type of drawing after life..." Comparison of the translator with a [[musician]] or [[actor]] goes back at least to [[Samuel Johnson]]'s remark about [[Alexander Pope]] playing [[Homer]] on a [[flageolet]], while Homer himself used a [[bassoon]].&lt;ref name="Kasparek p. 85"/&gt;
[[File:Herder by Kügelgen.jpg|thumb|left|140px|[[Johann Gottfried Herder]]]]
If translation be an art, it is no easy one.  In the 13th century, [[Roger Bacon]] wrote that if a translation is to be true, the translator must know both [[language]]s, as well as the [[science]] that he is to translate; and finding that few translators did, he wanted to do away with translation and translators altogether.&lt;ref&gt;Kasparek, "The Translator's Endless Toil", pp. 85-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ignacy Krasicki 111.PNG|thumb|125px|[[Ignacy Krasicki]]]]
The translator of the Bible into German, [[Martin Luther]] (1483–1546), is credited with being the first European to posit that one translates satisfactorily only toward his own language. L.G. Kelly states that since [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] in the 18th century, "it has been axiomatic" that one translates only toward his own language.&lt;ref&gt;L.G. Kelly, cited in Kasparek, "The Translator's Endless Toil", p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Compounding the demands on the translator is the fact that no [[dictionary]] or [[thesaurus]] can ever be a fully adequate guide in translating. The Scottish historian [[Alexander Fraser Tytler, Lord Woodhouselee|Alexander Tytler]], in his ''Essay on the Principles of Translation'' (1790), emphasized that assiduous [[reading (activity)|reading]] is a more comprehensive guide to a language than are dictionaries. The same point, but also including [[listening]] to the [[spoken language|''spoken'' language]], had earlier, in 1783, been made by the Polish poet and [[grammar]]ian [[Onufry Kopczyński]].&lt;ref name="Kasparek p. 86"&gt;Kasparek, "The Translator's Endless Toil", p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

The translator's special role in society is described in a posthumous 1803 essay by "Poland's [[La Fontaine]]", the Roman Catholic [[Primate of Poland]], [[Poetry|poet]], [[Encyclopedia|encyclopedist]], [[Novelist|author]] of the first Polish novel, and translator from French and Greek, [[Ignacy Krasicki]]:

{{blockquote|[T]ranslation... is in fact an art both estimable and very difficult, and therefore is not the labor and portion of common minds; [it] should be [practiced] by those who are themselves capable of being actors, when they see greater use in translating the works of others than in their own works, and hold higher than their own glory the service that they render their country.&lt;ref&gt;Cited by Kasparek, "The Translator's Endless Toil", p. 87, from [[Ignacy Krasicki]], {{lang|pl|"O tłumaczeniu ksiąg"}} ("On Translating Books"), in {{lang|pl|Dzieła wierszem i prozą}} (Works in Verse and Prose), 1803, reprinted in [[Edward Balcerzan]], ed., {{lang|pl|Pisarze polscy o sztuce przekładu, 1440–1974: Antologia}} (Polish Writers on the Art of Translation, 1440–1974: an Anthology), p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Other traditions===
Due to [[Western colonialism]] and cultural dominance in recent centuries, Western translation traditions have largely replaced other traditions. The Western traditions draw on both ancient and medieval traditions, and on more recent European innovations.

Though earlier approaches to translation are less commonly used today, they retain importance when dealing with their products, as when historians view ancient or medieval records to piece together events which took place in non-Western or pre-Western environments. Also, though heavily influenced by Western traditions and practiced by translators taught in Western-style educational systems, Chinese and related translation traditions retain some theories and philosophies unique to the Chinese tradition.

==== Near East ====
{{Expand section|date=March 2012}}
Traditions of translating material among the languages of ancient [[Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[Assyria]] ([[Syriac language]]), [[Anatolia]], and [[Israel]] ([[Hebrew language]]) go back several millennia.  There exist partial translations of the Sumerian ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' (c. 2000 BCE) into [[Southwest Asia]]n languages of the second millennium BCE.&lt;ref&gt;J.M. Cohen, "Translation", ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]'', 1986, vol. 27, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

An early example of a [[bilingual]] document is the 1274 BCE [[Treaty of Kadesh]] between the [[ancient Egypt]]ian and [[Hittite Empire|Hittie empire]]s.

====Asia====
{{Further|Chinese translation theory}}
[[File:Jingangjing.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Buddhism|Buddhist]] ''[[Diamond Sutra]]'', translated into [[Chinese language|Chinese]] by [[Kumārajīva]]:  world's oldest known dated printed book (868 CE)]]

There is a separate tradition of translation in [[South Asia|South]], [[Southeast Asia|Southeast]] and [[East Asia]] (primarily of texts from the [[India]]n and [[China|Chinese]] civilizations), connected especially with the rendering of religious, particularly [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], texts and with the governance of the Chinese empire. Classical Indian translation is characterized by loose adaptation, rather than the closer translation more commonly found in Europe; and [[Chinese translation theory]] identifies various criteria and limitations in translation.

In the East Asian sphere of Chinese cultural influence, more important than translation ''per se'' has been the use and reading of Chinese texts, which also had substantial influence on the Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese languages, with substantial [[Sino-Xenic vocabularies|borrowings of Chinese vocabulary]] and writing system. Notable is the Japanese [[kanbun]], a system for [[Gloss (annotation)|glossing]] Chinese texts for Japanese speakers.

Though Indianized states in [[Southeast Asia]] often translated [[Sanskrit]] material into the local languages, the literate elites and scribes more commonly used Sanskrit as their primary language of culture and government.
[[File:VOA Perry Link.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Perry Link]]]]
Some special aspects of translating from [[Chinese language|Chinese]] are illustrated in [[Perry Link]]'s discussion of translating the work of the [[Tang Dynasty]] poet [[Wang Wei (Tang dynasty)|Wang Wei]] (699–759 CE).&lt;ref&gt;[[Perry Link]], "A Magician of Chinese Poetry" (review of [[Eliot Weinberger]], with an afterword by [[Octavio Paz]], ''19 Ways of Looking at [[Wang Wei (Tang dynasty)|Wang Wei]] (with More Ways)'', New Directions; and [[Eliot Weinberger]], ''The Ghosts of Birds'', New Directions), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXIII, no. 18 (November 24, 2016), pp. 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|Some of the art of classical [[Chinese poetry]] [writes Link] must simply be set aside as [[untranslatability|untranslatable]].  The internal structure of [[Chinese characters]] has a beauty of its own, and the [[calligraphy]] in which classical poems were written is another important but untranslatable dimension.  Since Chinese characters do not vary in length, and because there are exactly five characters per line in a poem like [the one that [[Eliot Weinberger]] discusses in ''19 Ways of Looking at [[Wang Wei (Tang dynasty)|Wang Wei]] (with More Ways)''], another untranslatable feature is that the written result, hung on a wall, presents a rectangle.  Translators into languages whose word lengths vary can reproduce such an effect only at the risk of fatal awkwardness....

Another imponderable is how to imitate the 1-2, 1-2-3 [[rhythm]] in which five-[[syllable]] lines in classical Chinese poems normally are read.  Chinese characters are pronounced in one syllable apiece, so producing such rhythms in Chinese is not hard and the results are unobtrusive; but any imitation in a Western language is almost inevitably stilted and distracting.  Even less translatable are the patterns of [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]] arrangement in classical Chinese poetry.  Each syllable (character) belongs to one of two categories determined by the [[pitch contour]] in which it is read; in a classical Chinese poem the patterns of alternation of the two categories exhibit [[Parallelism (grammar)|parallelism]] and mirroring.&lt;ref name="LXIII 2016 p. 49"&gt;[[Perry Link]], "A Magician of Chinese Poetry", ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXIII, no. 18 (November 24, 2016), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Once the [[untranslatability|untranslatables]] have been set aside, the problems for a translator, especially of Chinese poetry, are two:  What does the translator think the poetic line says?  And once he thinks he understands it, how can he render it into the [[Target language (translation)|target language]]?  Most of the difficulties, according to Link, arise in addressing the second problem, "where the impossibility of perfect answers spawns endless debate."  Almost always at the center is the letter-versus-spirit [[dilemma]].  At the [[literal translation|literalist]] extreme, efforts are made to dissect every conceivable detail about the language of the original Chinese poem.  "The dissection, though," writes Link, "normally does to the art of a poem approximately what the [[scalpel]] of an [[anatomy]] instructor does to the life of a frog."&lt;ref name="LXIII 2016 p. 49"/&gt;

Chinese characters, in avoiding [[grammar|grammatical]] specificity, offer advantages to poets (and, simultaneously, challenges to poetry translators) that are associated primarily with absences of [[Subject (grammar)|subject]], [[Grammatical number|number]], and [[Grammatical tense|tense]].&lt;ref name="LXIII 2016 p. 50"&gt;[[Perry Link]], "A Magician of Chinese Poetry", ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXIII, no. 18 (November 24, 2016), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the norm in classical Chinese poetry, and common even in modern Chinese prose, to omit [[Subject (grammar)|subjects]]; the reader or listener infers a subject.  Some Western languages, however, ask by grammatical rule that subjects always be stated.  Most of the translators cited in Eliot Weinberger's ''19 Ways of Looking at [[Wang Wei (Tang dynasty)|Wang Wei]]'' supply a subject.  Weinberger points out, however, that when an "I" as a subject is inserted, a "controlling individual mind of the poet" enters and destroys the effect of the Chinese line.  Without a subject, he writes, "the experience becomes both universal and immediate to the reader."  Another approach to the subjectlessness is to use the target language's [[passive voice]]; but this again particularizes the experience too much.&lt;ref name="LXIII 2016 p. 50"/&gt;

[[Noun]]s have no [[Grammatical number|number]] in Chinese.  "If," writes Link, "you want to talk in Chinese about one rose, you may, but then you use a "[[measure word]]" to say "one blossom-of roseness."&lt;ref name="LXIII 2016 p. 50"/&gt;

Chinese [[verb]]s are [[grammatical tense|tense]]-less:  there are several ways to specify when something happened or will happen, but [[verb tense]] is not one of them.  For poets, this creates the great advantage of [[ambiguity]].  According to Link, Weinberger's insight about subjectlessness—that it produces an effect "both universal and immediate"—applies to timelessness as well.&lt;ref name="LXIII 2016 p. 50"/&gt;

Link proposes a kind of uncertainty principle that may be applicable not only to translation from the Chinese language, but to all translation:

{{blockquote|Dilemmas about translation do not have definitive right answers (although there can be unambiguously wrong ones if misreadings of the original are involved).  Any translation (except machine translation, a different case) must pass through the mind of a translator, and that mind inevitably contains its own store of perceptions, memories, and values.

[[Eliot Weinberger|Weinberger]] [...] pushes this insight further when he writes that "every reading of every poem, regardless of language, is an act of translation:  translation into the reader's intellectual and emotional life."  Then he goes still further:  because a reader's mental life shifts over time, there is a sense in which "the same poem cannot be read twice."&lt;ref name="LXIII 2016 p. 50"/&gt;}}

====Islamic world====
Translation of material into [[Arabic language|Arabic]] expanded after the creation of [[Arabic script]] in the 5th century, and gained great importance with the rise of [[Islam]] and Islamic empires. Arab translation initially focused primarily on politics, rendering Persian, Greek, even Chinese and Indic diplomatic materials into Arabic. It later focused on translating classical Greek and Persian works, as well as some Chinese and Indian texts, into Arabic for scholarly study at major Islamic learning centers, such as the [[Madrasah of Al-Karaouine|Al-Karaouine]] ([[Fes]], [[Morocco]]), [[Al-Azhar Madrasah|Al-Azhar]] ([[Cairo]], [[Egypt]]), and the [[Al-Nizamiyya of Baghdad]]. In terms of theory, Arabic translation drew heavily on earlier Near Eastern traditions as well as more contemporary Greek and Persian traditions.

Arabic translation efforts and techniques are important to Western translation traditions due to centuries of close contacts and exchanges.  Especially after the [[Renaissance]], Europeans began more intensive study of Arabic and Persian translations of classical works as well as scientific and philosophical works of Arab and oriental origins.  Arabic and, to a lesser degree, Persian became important sources of material and perhaps of techniques for revitalized Western traditions, which in time would overtake the Islamic and oriental traditions.

In the 19th century, after the [[Middle East]]'s [[Islam]]ic clerics and copyists
{{blockquote|had conceded defeat in their centuries-old battle to contain the corrupting effects of the [[printing press]], [an] explosion in publishing... ensued.  Along with expanding secular education, printing transformed an overwhelmingly illiterate society into a partly literate one.

In the past, the [[sheikh]]s and the government had exercised a monopoly over knowledge.  Now an expanding elite benefitted from a stream of information on virtually anything that interested them.  Between 1880 and 1908... more than six hundred newspapers and periodicals were founded in Egypt alone.

The most prominent among them was ''al-Muqtataf''...  [It] was the popular expression of a '''translation movement''' that had begun earlier in the century with military and medical manuals and highlights from the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] canon.  ([[Montesquieu]]'s ''Considerations on the Romans'' and [[Fénelon]]'s ''Telemachus'' had been favorites.)&lt;ref name = debellaigue77&gt;[[Christopher de Bellaigue]], "Dreams of Islamic Liberalism" (review of Marwa Elshakry, ''Reading Darwin in Arabic, 1860–1950'', University of Chicago Press), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXII, no. 10 (June 4, 2015), p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A translator who contributed mightily to the advance of the Islamic Enlightenment was the Egyptian cleric Rifaa al-Tahtawi (1801–73), who had spent five years in Paris in the late 1820s, teaching religion to Muslim students.  After returning to Cairo with the encouragement of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]] (1769–1849), the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] viceroy of Egypt, al–Tahtawi became head of the new school of languages and embarked on an intellectual revolution by initiating a program to translate some two thousand European and Turkish volumes, ranging from ancient texts on geography and geometry to [[Voltaire]]'s biography of [[Peter the Great]], along with the ''[[Marseillaise]]'' and the entire ''[[Code Napoléon]]''.  This was the biggest, most meaningful importation of foreign thought into Arabic since [[Abbasid]] times (750–1258).&lt;ref&gt;[[Malise Ruthven]], "The Islamic Road to the Modern World" (review of [[Christopher de Bellaigue]], ''The Islamic Enlightenment:  The Struggle between Faith and Reason, 1798 to Modern Times'', Liveright; and Wael Abu-'Uksa, ''Freedom in the Arab World:  Concepts and Ideologies in Arabic Thought in the Nineteenth Century'', Cambridge University Press), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXIV, no. 11 (22 June 2017), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|In France al-Tahtawi had been struck by the way the [[French language|French]] language... was constantly renewing itself to fit modern ways of living.  Yet [[Arabic]] has its own sources of reinvention.  The root system that Arabic shares with other [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] tongues such as [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] is capable of expanding the meanings of words using structured [[consonant]]al variations:  the word for airplane, for example, has the same root as the word for bird.&lt;ref&gt;[[Malise Ruthven]], "The Islamic Road to the Modern World" (review of [[Christopher de Bellaigue]], ''The Islamic Enlightenment:  The Struggle between Faith and Reason, 1798 to Modern Times'', Liveright; and Wael Abu-'Uksa, ''Freedom in the Arab World:  Concepts and Ideologies in Arabic Thought in the Nineteenth Century'', Cambridge University Press), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol.

The movement to translate English and European texts transformed the Arabic and [[Ottoman Turkey|Ottoman]] [[Turkish language|Turkish]] languages, and new words, simplified [[syntax]], and directness came to be valued over the previous convolutions.  Educated Arabs and Turks in the new professions and the modernized [[civil service]] expressed [[skepticism]], writes [[Christopher de Bellaigue]], "with a freedom that is rarely witnessed today....  No longer was legitimate knowledge defined by texts in the religious schools, interpreted for the most part with stultifying literalness.  It had come to include virtually any intellectual production anywhere in the world."  One of the [[neologisms]] that, in a way, came to characterize the infusion of new ideas via translation was ''"darwiniya"'', or "[[Darwinism]]".&lt;ref name = debellaigue77/&gt;

One of the most influential liberal Islamic thinkers of the time was [[Muhammad Abduh]] (1849–1905), Egypt's senior judicial authority—its chief [[mufti]]—at the turn of the 20th century and an admirer of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] who in 1903 visited Darwin's exponent [[Herbert Spencer]] at his home in [[Brighton]].

After [[World War I]], when Britain and France divided up the Middle East's countries, apart from Turkey, between them, pursuant to the [[Sykes-Picot agreement]]—in violation of solemn wartime promises of postwar Arab autonomy—there came an immediate reaction:  the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] emerged in Egypt, the [[House of Saud]] took over the [[Hijaz]], and regimes led by army officers came to power in [[Iran]] and Turkey.  "[B]oth illiberal currents of the modern Middle East," writes [[Christopher de Bellaigue|de Bellaigue]], "Islamism and militarism, received a major impetus from Western [[Imperialism|empire-builders]]."  As often happens in countries undergoing social crisis, the aspirations of the Muslim world's translators and modernizers, such as Muhammad Abduh, largely had to yield to retrograde currents.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher de Bellaigue]], "Dreams of Islamic Liberalism" (review of Marwa Elshakry, ''Reading Darwin in Arabic, 1860–1950''), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol.

==Fidelity and transparency&lt;!--linked from 'Friedrich Schleiermacher'--&gt;==
[[File:John Dryden by John Michael Wright, 1668 (detail), National Portrait Gallery, London.JPG|thumb|right|175px|[[John Dryden|Dryden]]]]
[[Fidelity]] (or "faithfulness") and felicity&lt;ref&gt;[[Marina Warner]], "The Politics of Translation" (a review of [[Kate Briggs]], ''This Little Art'', 2017; [[Mireille Gansel]], translated by [[Ros Schwartz]], 2017; [[Mark Polizzotti]], ''Sympathy for the Traitor:  A Translation Manifesto'', 2018; [[Boyd Tonkin]], ed., ''The 100 Best Novels in Translation'', 2018; [[Clive Scott (linguist)|Clive Scott]], ''The Work of Literary Translation'', 2018), ''[[London Review of Books]]'', vol. 40, no. 19 (11 October 2018), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; (or [[transparency (linguistic)|transparency]]), dual ideals in translation, are often (though not always) at odds. A 17th-century French critic coined the phrase "{{lang|fr|les belles infidèles}}" to suggest that translations, like women, can be either faithful or beautiful, but not both.{{efn|French philosopher and writer [[Gilles Ménage]] (1613-92) commented on translations by humanist Perrot Nicolas d'Ablancourt (1606-64):  "They remind me of a woman whom I greatly loved in [[Tours]], who was beautiful but unfaithful."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Amparo Hurtado Albir, ''La notion de fidélité en traduction'' (The Idea of Fidelity in Translation), Paris, Didier Érudition, 1990, p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;}}  [[Fidelity]] is the extent to which a translation accurately renders the meaning of the [[source text]], without distortion.[[Transparency (linguistic)|Transparency]] is the extent to which a translation appears to a native speaker of the target language to have originally been written in that language, and conforms to its grammar, syntax and idiom. [[John Dryden]] (1631–1700) wrote in his preface to the translation anthology ''Sylvae'':
{{blockquote|Where I have taken away some of [the original authors'] Expressions, and cut them shorter, it may possibly be on this consideration, that what was beautiful in the Greek or Latin, would not appear so shining in the English; and where I have enlarg'd them, I desire the false Criticks would not always think that those thoughts are wholly mine, but that either they are secretly in the Poet, or may be fairly deduc'd from him; or at least, if both those considerations should fail, that my own is of a piece with his, and that if he were living, and an Englishman, they are such as he wou'd probably have written.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dryden|first1=John|title=Preface to Sylvae|url=http://www.bartleby.com/204/180.html|website=Bartelby.com|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A translation that meets the criterion of fidelity (faithfulness) is said to be "faithful"; a translation that meets the criterion of transparency, "[[idiomatic]]".  Depending on the given translation, the two qualities may not be mutually exclusive.  The criteria for judging the [[fidelity]] of a translation vary according to the subject, type and use of the text, its literary qualities, its social or historical context, etc.  The criteria for judging the [[transparency (linguistic)|transparency]] of a translation appear more straightforward: an unidiomatic translation "sounds wrong"; and, in the extreme case of [[literal translation|word-for-word translations]] generated by many [[machine translation|machine-translation]] systems, often results in patent nonsense.
[[File:Friedrich Daniel Ernst Schleiermacher.jpg|thumb|right|130px|[[Friedrich Schleiermacher|Schleiermacher]]]]  
Nevertheless, in certain contexts a translator may consciously seek to produce a [[literal translation]]. Translators of [[literary]], [[religious]], or [[historic]] texts often adhere as closely as possible to the source text, stretching the limits of the target language to produce an unidiomatic text.  Also, a translator may adopt expressions from the source language in order to provide "local color".
[[File:Lawrence Venuti.jpeg|thumb|90px|[[Lawrence Venuti|Venuti]]]]
While current Western translation practice is dominated by the dual concepts of "fidelity" and "transparency", this has not always been the case.  There have been periods, especially in pre-Classical Rome and in the 18th century, when many translators stepped beyond the bounds of translation proper into the realm of ''[[adaptation]]''.  [[Adapted translation]] retains currency in some non-Western traditions. The [[India]]n epic, the ''[[Ramayana]]'', appears in many versions in the various [[Languages of India|Indian languages]], and the stories are different in each.  Similar examples are to be found in [[medieval Christianity|medieval Christian]] literature, which adjusted the text to local customs and mores.

Many non-transparent-translation theories draw on concepts from [[German Romanticism]], the most obvious influence being the German theologian and philosopher [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]]. In his seminal lecture "On the Different Methods of Translation" (1813) he distinguished between translation methods that move "the writer toward [the reader]", i.e., [[transparency (linguistic)|transparency]], and those that move the "reader toward [the author]", i.e., an extreme [[fidelity]] to the foreignness of the [[source text]]. Schleiermacher favored the latter approach; he was motivated, however, not so much by a desire to embrace the foreign, as by a nationalist desire to oppose France's cultural domination and to promote [[German literature]].

In recent decades, prominent advocates of such "non-transparent" translation have included the French scholar [[Antoine Berman]], who identified twelve deforming tendencies inherent in most prose translations,&lt;ref&gt;[[Antoine Berman]], ''L'épreuve de l'étranger'', 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; and the American theorist [[Lawrence Venuti]], who has called on translators to apply "foreignizing" rather than domesticating translation strategies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lawrence Venuti]], "Call to Action", in ''The Translator's Invisibility'', 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equivalence===
{{main|Dynamic and formal equivalence}}
The question of [[fidelity]] vs. [[transparency (linguistic)|transparency]] has also been formulated in terms of, respectively, "''formal'' equivalence" and "''dynamic'' [or ''functional''] equivalence" – expressions associated with the translator [[Eugene Nida]] and originally coined to describe ways of translating the ''[[Bible]]''; but the two approaches are applicable to any translation.  "Formal equivalence" corresponds to "[[metaphrase]]", and "dynamic equivalence" to "[[paraphrase]]".  "Formal equivalence" (sought via [[literal translation|"literal" translation]]) attempts to render the text literally, or "word for word" (the latter expression being itself a word-for-word rendering of the [[classical Latin]] {{lang|la|verbum pro verbo}}) – if necessary, at the expense of features natural to the target language.  By contrast, "dynamic equivalence" (or "''functional'' equivalence") conveys the essential thoughts expressed in a source text—if necessary, at the expense of [[literal translation|literality]], original [[sememe]] and [[word order]], the source text's active vs. passive [[voice (grammar)|voice]], etc. 
 
There is, however, no sharp boundary between formal and functional equivalence. On the contrary, they represent a spectrum of translation approaches. Each is used at various times and in various contexts by the same translator, and at various points within the same text – sometimes simultaneously. Competent translation entails the judicious blending of formal and functional [[Dynamic and formal equivalence|equivalents]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Kasparek]], "The Translator's Endless Toil", pp. 83-87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Common pitfalls in translation, especially when practiced by inexperienced translators, involve false equivalents such as "[[false friend]]s"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog-english.jrlanguage.com/overcome-5-challenges-of-english-to-spanish-translation/|title=How to Overcome These 5 Challenges of English to Spanish Translation|date=23 June 2017|publisher=Jr Language|accessdate=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[false cognate]]s.

===Back-translation===
A "back-translation" is a translation of a translated text back into the language of the original text, made without reference to the original text. 
Comparison of a back-translation with the original text is sometimes used as a check on the accuracy of the original translation, much as the accuracy of a mathematical operation is sometimes checked by reversing the operation.  But the results of such reverse-translation operations, while useful as approximate checks, are not always precisely reliable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.atc.org.uk/winter2004.pdf |title=Back Translation: Same questions – different continent |journal=Communicate |issue=Winter 2004 |page=5 |last=Crystal |first=Scott |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-11-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060520035802/http://www.atc.org.uk/winter2004.pdf |archivedate=2006-05-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Back-translation must in general be less accurate than back-calculation because [[linguistic]] symbols ([[word]]s) are often [[ambiguous]], whereas mathematical symbols are intentionally unequivocal.  In the context of [[machine translation]], a back-translation is also called a "round-trip translation."  When translations are produced of material used in medical [[clinical trial]]s, such as [[informed consent|informed-consent forms]], a back-translation is often required by the [[Ethics Committee (European Union)|ethics committee]] or [[institutional review board]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.gts-translation.com/medicaltranslationpaper.pdf |title=Back Translation for Quality Control of Informed Consent Forms |journal=Journal of Clinical Research Best Practices |format=PDF |accessdate=1 February 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060505141653/http://www.gts-translation.com/medicaltranslationpaper.pdf |archivedate=5 May 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Mark Twain, Brady-Handy photo portrait, Feb 7, 1871, cropped.jpg|thumb|left|80px|[[Mark Twain]], back-translator]]
[[Mark Twain]] provided humorously telling evidence for the frequent unreliability of back-translation when he issued his own back-translation of a French translation of his [[short story]], "[[The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County]]".  He published his back-translation in a 1903 volume together with his English-language original, the French translation, and a "Private History of the 'Jumping Frog' Story". The latter included a synopsized adaptation of his story that Twain stated had appeared, unattributed to Twain, in a Professor Sidgwick's ''Greek Prose Composition'' (p.&amp;nbsp;116) under the title, "The Athenian and the Frog"; the adaptation had for a time been taken for an independent [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] precursor to Twain's "Jumping Frog" story.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=ld_3LPm8FKkC&amp;dq=french+The+Jumping+Frog&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=4trjrMcmq3&amp;sig=P23kCS1s9qiu-1hdnJSzWWKvIJc&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result#PPA66,M1 [[Mark Twain]], ''[[The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County|The Jumping Frog]]: In English, Then in French, and Then Clawed Back into a Civilized Language Once More by Patient, Unremunerated Toil'', illustrated by F. Strothman, New York and London, Harper &amp; Brothers, Publishers, MCMIII [1903&amp;#93;].&lt;/ref&gt;

When a document survives only in translation, the original having been lost, researchers sometimes undertake back-translation in an effort to reconstruct the original text. An example involves the novel ''[[The Manuscript Found in Saragossa|The Saragossa Manuscript]]'' by the Polish aristocrat [[Jan Potocki]] (1761–1815), who wrote the novel in French and anonymously published fragments in 1804 and 1813–14. Portions of the original French-language manuscript were subsequently lost; however, the missing fragments survived in a Polish translation that was made by [[Edmund Chojecki]] in 1847 from a complete French copy, now lost. French-language versions of the complete ''Saragossa Manuscript'' have since been produced, based on extant French-language fragments and on French-language versions that have been back-translated from Chojecki's Polish version.&lt;ref&gt;[[Czesław Miłosz]], ''The History of Polish Literature'', pp. 193–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many works by the influential [[classical antiquity|Classical]] physician [[Galen]] survive only in medieval [[Arabic language|Arabic]] translation. Some survive only in [[Renaissance Latin]] translations from the Arabic, thus at a second remove from the original. To better understand Galen, scholars have attempted back-translation of such works in order to reconstruct the original [[ancient Greek|Greek]].{{cn|date=September 2018}}

When historians suspect that a document is actually a translation from another language, back-translation into that hypothetical original language can provide supporting evidence by showing that such characteristics as [[idiom]]s, [[pun]]s, peculiar [[grammar|grammatical]] structures, etc., are in fact derived from the original language.  For example, the known text of the ''[[Till Eulenspiegel]]'' folk tales is in [[High German]] but contains puns that work only when back-translated to [[Low German]].  This seems clear evidence that these tales (or at least large portions of them) were originally written in Low German and translated into High German by an over-metaphrastic translator.

Supporters of [[Aramaic primacy]]—of the view that the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[New Testament]] or its sources were originally written in the [[Aramaic language]]—seek to prove their case by showing that difficult passages in the existing [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] text of the New Testament make much better sense when back-translated to [[Aramaic]]: that, for example, some incomprehensible references are in fact Aramaic puns that do not work in Greek.  Due to similar indications, it is believed that the 2nd century Gnostic [[Gospel of Judas]], which survives only in [[Coptic language|Coptic]], was originally written in [[Greek language|Greek]].

[[John Dryden]] (1631–1700), the dominant English-language literary figure of his age, illustrates, in his use of back-translation, translators' influence on the evolution of languages and literary styles.  Dryden is believed to be the first person to posit that English sentences should not end in [[preposition]]s because Latin sentences cannot end in prepositions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ling.kgw.tu-berlin.de/lexicography/data/B_HIST_EU.html Gilman, E.

Pullum, 2002, The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language. Cambridge (UK): Cambridge University Press, p. 627f.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dryden often translated his writing into [[Latin]], to check whether his writing was concise and elegant, Latin being considered an elegant and long-lived language with which to compare; then he back-translated his writing back to English according to Latin-grammar usage. As Latin does not have sentences ending in prepositions, Dryden may have applied Latin grammar to English, thus forming the controversial rule of no sentence-ending prepositions, subsequently adopted by other writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3komDgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=word+by+word+kory+stamper#v=onepage&amp;q=word%20by%20word%20kory%20stamper&amp;f=false|title=Word by Word: The Secret Life of Dictionaries|last=Stamper|first=Kory|date=2017-01-01|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|year=|isbn=9781101870945|location=|pages=47|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Cf. a supposed comment by [[Winston Churchill]]:  "This is the type of pedantry up with which I will not put."}}

== Translators ==
Competent translators show the following attributes:
*a ''very good'' knowledge of the language, written and spoken, ''from which'' they are translating (the [[Source language (translation)|source language]]);
*an ''excellent'' command of the language ''into which'' they are translating (the [[Target language (translation)|target language]]);
*familiarity with the subject matter of the text being translated;
*a profound understanding of the [[etymological]] and [[idiomatic]] correlates between the two languages, including [[Register (sociolinguistics)|sociolinguistic register]] when appropriate; and
*a finely tuned sense of when to ''[[metaphrase]]'' ([[literal translation|"translate literally]]") and when to ''[[paraphrase]]'', so as to assure true rather than spurious ''[[Translation#Equivalence|equivalents]]'' between the source- and target-language texts.&lt;ref&gt;*[[Christopher Kasparek]], "Prus' ''Pharaoh'' and Curtin's Translation," ''[[The Polish Review]]'', vol. XXXI, nos. 2–3 (1986), p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

A competent translator is not only [[bilingual]] but [[bicultural]].  A [[language]] is not merely a collection of [[word]]s and of rules of [[grammar]] and [[syntax]] for generating [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s, but also a vast interconnecting system of [[connotation]]s and [[culture|cultural]] references whose mastery, writes [[linguist]] [[Mario Pei]], "comes close to being a lifetime job."&lt;ref&gt;[[Mario Pei]], ''The Story of Language'', p. 424.&lt;/ref&gt;  The complexity of the translator's task cannot be overstated; one author suggests that becoming an accomplished translator—after having already acquired a good basic knowledge of both languages and cultures—may require a minimum of ten years' experience.  Viewed in this light, it is a serious misconception to assume that a person who has fair fluency in two languages will, by virtue of that fact alone, be consistently competent to translate between them.&lt;ref name="Kasparek p. 86"/&gt;

The translator's role in relation to a text has been compared to that of an artist, e.g., a musician or actor, who interprets a work of art.  Translation, like other human activities,&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Greenblatt]], "Can We Ever Master King Lear?", ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXIV, no. 3 (February 23, 2017), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; entails making choices, and choice implies interpretation.&lt;ref name="Kasparek p. 85"/&gt;{{efn|"Interpretation" in this sense is to be distinguished from the function of an "[[Translation#Interpreting|"interpreter"]] who translates orally or by the use of [[sign language]].}}  [[Mark Polizzotti]] writes:  "A good translation offers not a reproduction of the work but an interpretation, a re-representation, just as the performance of a [[Play (theatre)|play]] or a [[sonata]] is a representation of the [[Play (theatre)|script]] or the [[Sheet music|score]], one among many possible representations."&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Polizzotti]], quoted in [[Marina Warner]], "The Politics of Translation" (a review of [[Kate Briggs]], ''This Little Art'', 2017; [[Mireille Gansel]], translated by [[Ros Schwartz]], 2017; [[Mark Polizzotti]], ''Sympathy for the Traitor:  A Translation Manifesto'', 2018; [[Boyd Tonkin]], ed., ''The 100 Best Novels in Translation'', 2018; [[Clive Scott (linguist)|Clive Scott]], ''The Work of Literary Translation'', 2018), ''[[London Review of Books]]'', vol. 40, no. 19 (11 October 2018), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The English-language novelist [[Joseph Conrad]], whose writings [[Zdzisław Najder]] has described as verging on "auto-translation" from Conrad's Polish and French linguistic personae,&lt;ref&gt;[[Zdzisław Najder]], ''Joseph Conrad:  A Life'', 2007, p. IX.&lt;/ref&gt; advised his niece and [[Polish language|Polish]] translator [[Aniela Zagórska]]:  "[D]on't trouble to be too scrupulous...  I may tell you (in French) that in my opinion ''il vaut mieux interpréter que traduire'' [it is better to interpret than to translate]....  ''Il s'agit donc de trouver les équivalents.  Et là, ma chère, je vous prie laissez vous guider plutôt par votre tempérament que par une conscience sévère....'' [It is, then, a question of finding the equivalent expressions.  And there, my dear, I beg you to let yourself be guided more by your temperament than by a strict conscience....]"&lt;ref&gt;[[Zdzisław Najder]], ''Joseph Conrad:  A Life'', 2007, p. 524.&lt;/ref&gt;  Conrad advised another translator that the prime requisite for a good translation is that it be "idiomatic".  "For in the [[idiom]] is the ''clearness'' of a language and the language's force and its picturesqueness—by which last I mean the picture-producing power of arranged words."&lt;ref&gt;[[Zdzisław Najder]], ''Joseph Conrad:  A Life'', 2007, p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt;  Conrad thought [[C.K. Scott Moncrieff]]'s English translation of [[Marcel Proust]]'s ''À la recherche du temps perdu'' (''[[In Search of Lost Time]]''—or, in Scott Moncrieff's rendering, ''Remembrance of Things Past'') to be preferable to the French original.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Kaiser, "A Hero of Translation" (a review of Jean Findlay, ''Chasing Lost Time:  The Life of [[C.K. Scott Moncrieff]]:  Soldier, Spy, and Translator''), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXII, no. 10 (June 4, 2015), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|See "[[Translation#Poetry|Poetry]]", below, for a similar observation concerning the occasional superiority of the translation over the original.}}

The necessity of making [[choice]]s, and therefore of interpretation, in translating{{efn|[[Emily Wilson (classicist)|Emily Wilson]] writes that "translation always involves interpretation, and [requires] every translator... to think as deeply as humanly possible about each verbal, poetic, and interpretative [[choice]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Emily Wilson (classicist)|Emily Wilson]], "A Doggish Translation" (review of ''The Poems of [[Hesiod]]:  Theogony, Works and Days, and The Shield of Herakles'', translated from the Greek by [[Barry B. Powell]], [[University of California Press]], 2017, 184 pp.), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXV, no. 1 (18 January 2018), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;}} (and in other fields of human endeavor) stems from the [[ambiguity]] that subjectively pervades the [[universe]].  Part of the ambiguity, for a translator, involves the structure of human [[language]]. [[Psychology|Psychologist]] and [[neural science|neural scientist]] [[Gary Marcus]] notes that "virtually every sentence [that people generate] is [[ambiguity|ambiguous]], often in multiple ways.  Our brain is so good at comprehending language that we do not usually notice."&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Marcus]], "Am I Human?:  Researchers need new ways to distinguish artificial intelligence from the natural kind", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 316, no. 3 (March 2017), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of linguistic ambiguity is the "pronoun disambiguation problem" ("PDP"):  a machine has no way of determining to whom or what a [[pronoun]] in a sentence—such as "he", "she" or "it"—refers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Marcus]], "Am I Human?:  Researchers need new ways to distinguish artificial intelligence from the natural kind", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 316, no. 3 (March 2017), p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;  Such disambiguation is not infallible by a human, either.

Ambiguity is a concern to both translators and, as the writings of poet and literary critic [[William Empson]] have demonstrated, to [[literary criticism|literary critics]].  Ambiguity may be desirable, indeed essential, in [[poetry]] and [[diplomacy]]; it can be more problematic in ordinary [[prose]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Bromwich]], "In Praise of Ambiguity" (a review of [[Michael Wood (academic)|Michael Wood]], ''On Empson'', [[Princeton University Press]], 2017), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''), vol. LXIV, no. 16 (26 October 2017), pp. 50–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

A translator is faced with two contradictory tasks:  when translating, he must strive for [[omniscience]]; when reviewing his translation, he must assume (the naive reader's) [[ignorance]]. 

A translator may render only parts of the original text, provided he indicates that this is what he is doing.  But a translator should not assume the role of [[Censorship|censor]] and surreptitiously delete or [[bowdlerize]] passages merely to please a political or moral interest.&lt;ref name="Billiani, Francesca 2001"&gt;Billiani, Francesca (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

Translating has served as a school of writing for many an author, much as the copying of masterworks of [[painting]] has schooled many a novice painter.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anka Muhlstein]], "Painters and Writers:  When Something New Happens", ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXIV, no. 1 (January 19, 2017), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;  A translator who can competently render an author's thoughts into the translator's own language, should certainly be able to adequately render, in his own language, any thoughts of his own.  Translating (like [[analytic philosophy]]) compels precise analysis of [[language|language element]]s and of their usage.  In 1946 the poet [[Ezra Pound]], then at [[St. Elizabeth's Hospital]], in [[Washington, D.C.]], advised a visitor, the 18-year-old beginning poet [[W.S. Merwin]]:  "The work of translation is the best teacher you'll ever have."&lt;ref&gt;''[[W.S. Merwin: To Plant a Tree]]'':  one-hour documentary shown on [[PBS]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Elsewhere Merwin recalls Pound saying:  "[A]t your age you don't have anything to write about.  You may think you do, but you don't.  So get to work translating.  The [[Occitan language|Provençal]] is the real source...."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ange Mlinko]], "Whole Earth Troubador" (review of ''The Essential W.S. Merlin'', edited by [[Michael Wiegers]], Copper Canyon, 338 pp., 2017), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXIV, no. 19 (7 December 2017), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;}}  Merwin, translator-poet who took Pound's advice to heart, writes of translation as an "impossible, unfinishable" art.&lt;ref&gt;Merwin's introduction to his 2013 ''Selected Translations'', quoted by [[Ange Mlinko]], "Whole Earth Troubador" (review of ''The Essential W.S.

Translators, including monks who spread [[Buddhist]] texts in [[East Asia]], and the early modern European translators of the [[Bible]], in the course of their work have shaped the very [[language]]s into which they have translated. They have acted as bridges for conveying knowledge between [[culture]]s; and along with ideas, they have imported from the source languages, into their own languages, [[loanword]]s and [[calque]]s of [[grammar|grammatical structures]], [[idiom]]s, and [[vocabulary]].

===Interpreting===

{{Main|Interpreting}}
[[Interpreting]], or "interpretation," is the facilitation of [[speech communication|oral]] or [[sign language|sign-language]] [[communication]], either simultaneously or consecutively, between two, or among three or more, speakers who are not speaking, or signing, the same language.  The term "interpreting," rather than "interpretation," is preferentially used for this activity by [[English language|Anglophone]] translators, to avoid confusion with other meanings of the word "[[wikt:interpret|interpretation]]."  Unlike English, many languages do not employ two separate words to denote the activities of [[writing|written]] and live-communication ([[speech communication|oral]] or [[sign language|sign-language]]) translators.{{efn|For example, in [[Polish language|Polish]], a "translation" is "{{lang|pl|przekład}}" or "{{lang|pl|tłumaczenie}}." Both "translator" and "interpreter" are "{{lang|pl|tłumacz}}." For a time in the 18th century, however, for "translator," some writers used a word, "{{lang|pl|przekładowca}}," that is no longer in use.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Balcerzan]], {{lang|pl|Pisarze polscy o sztuce przekładu, 1440–1974: Antologia}} (Polish Writers on the Art of Translation, 1440–1974: an Anthology), 1977, ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Even English does not always make the distinction, frequently using "translating" as a synonym for "interpreting."

Interpreters have sometimes played crucial roles in [[History of the world|history]].  A prime example is [[La Malinche]], also known as ''Malintzin'', ''Malinalli'' and ''Doña Marina'', an early-16th-century [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] woman from the Mexican [[Gulf of Mexico|Gulf Coast]].  As a child she had been sold or given to [[Maya peoples|Maya]] slave-traders from Xicalango, and thus had become bilingual. Subsequently, given along with other women to the invading Spaniards, she became instrumental in the [[Spain|Spanish]] conquest of [[Mexico]], acting as interpreter, adviser, intermediary and lover to [[Hernán Cortés]].&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Thomas, ''Conquest: Montezuma, Cortes and the Fall of Old Mexico'', New York, Simon and Schuster, 1993, pp. 171-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly three centuries later, in the [[United States]], a comparable role as interpreter was played for the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] of 1804–6 by [[Sacagawea]]. As a child, the [[Lemhi Shoshone]] woman had been kidnapped by [[Hidatsa]] Indians and thus had become bilingual.  Sacagawea facilitated the expedition's traverse of the [[North American continent]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;"Sacagawea", ''[[The Encyclopedia Americana]]'', 1986, volume 24, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sworn translation===
[[Translating for legal equivalence|Sworn translation]], also called "certified translation," aims at legal equivalence between two documents written in different languages. It is performed by someone authorized to do so by local regulations. Some countries recognize declared competence. Others require the translator to be an official state appointee. In some countries, such as the United Kingdom, translators must be accredited by certain translation institutes or associations in order to be able to carry out certified translations.

===Telephone===
Many commercial services exist that will interpret spoken language via telephone.  There is also at least one custom-built mobile device that does the same thing. The device connects users to human interpreters who can translate between English and 180 other languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2013/06/27/186525030/translation-please-hand-held-device-bridges-language-gap |title=Translation, Please: Hand-Held Device Bridges Language Gap |publisher=NPR |accessdate=2014-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet===
Web-based human translation is generally favored by companies and individuals that wish to secure more accurate translations. In view of the frequent inaccuracy of machine translations, human translation remains the most reliable, most accurate form of translation available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/node/15582327?story_id=15582327&amp;source=hptextfeature | work=The Economist | title=The many voices of the web | date=2010-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the recent emergence of translation [[crowdsourcing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Graham |first=Paul |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2011-07/04/mechanical-turkish-ackuna |title=How Ackuna wants to fix language translation by crowdsourcing it &amp;#124; Wired UK |publisher=Wired.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-05-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120517232045/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2011-07/04/mechanical-turkish-ackuna |archive-date=2012-05-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.benzinga.com/press-releases/11/02/p843476/translation-services-usas-crowdsourcing-translator-ackuna-com-raises-th |title=Translation Services USA's Crowdsourcing Translator, Ackuna.com, Raises the Bar for More Accurate Machine Translations |publisher=Benzinga |date= |accessdate=2012-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Translation memory|translation-memory]] techniques, and [[internet]] applications,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/346412 |title=Translation Cloud Application for Facebook Releases Version 2.0 |publisher=Digital Journal |date=2011-06-24 |accessdate=2012-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; translation agencies have been able to provide on-demand human-translation services to [[Small and medium businesses|business]]es, individuals, and enterprises.

===Computer assist===
{{Main|Computer-assisted translation}}
Computer-assisted translation (CAT), also called "computer-aided translation," "machine-aided human translation" (MAHT) and "interactive translation," is a form of translation wherein a human translator creates a [[target text]] with the assistance of a computer program. The machine supports a human translator.

Computer-assisted translation can include standard [[dictionary]] and grammar software. The term, however, normally refers to a range of specialized programs available to the translator, including [[translation memory|translation-memory]], [[terminology|terminology-management]], [[concordancer|concordance]], and alignment programs.

These tools speed up and facilitate human translation, but they do not provide translation.  The latter is a function of tools known broadly as machine translation.

==Machine translation==
{{Main|Machine translation}}
Machine translation (MT) is a process whereby a computer program analyzes a [[source text]] and, in principle, produces a target text without human intervention. In reality, however, machine translation typically does involve human intervention, in the form of pre-editing and [[post-editing]].&lt;ref name="NIST"&gt;See the [https://www.nist.gov/speech/tests/mt/ annually performed NIST tests since 2001] and [[Bilingual Evaluation Understudy]]&lt;/ref&gt;  With proper [[terminology|terminology work]], with preparation of the [[source text]] for machine translation (pre-editing), and with reworking of the machine translation by a human translator (post-editing), commercial machine-translation tools can produce useful results, especially if the machine-translation system is integrated with a [[translation memory|translation-memory]] or [[Globalization Management System|globalization-management system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Unedited machine translation is publicly available through tools on the [[Internet]] such as [[Google Translate]], [[Babel Fish (website)|Babel Fish]], [[Babylon translator|Babylon]], and [[StarDict]]. These produce rough translations that, under favorable circumstances, "give the gist" of the source text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://blog.ititranslates.com/why-translation-services-are-more-beneficial-than-machined-translation-programs|title=Why Professional Translators Are More Beneficial Than Google Translate|last=Choquette|first=Brandon|date=January 2016|journal=Interpreter and Translators, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the Internet, translation software can help non-native-speaking individuals understand web pages published in other languages. Whole-page-translation tools are of limited utility, however, since they offer only a limited potential understanding of the original author's intent and context; translated pages tend to be more erroneously humorous and confusing than enlightening.

Interactive translations with [[Pop-up ad|pop-up windows]] are becoming more popular. These tools show one or more possible equivalents for each word or phrase. Human operators merely need to select the likeliest equivalent as the mouse glides over the foreign-language text. Possible equivalents can be grouped by pronunciation.  Also, companies such as [[Ectaco]] produce pocket devices that provide machine translations.
[[File:Claude Piron.jpg|thumb|90px|[[Claude Piron]]]]
Relying exclusively on unedited machine translation, however, ignores the fact that communication in [[natural language|human language]] is [[wikt:context|context]]-embedded and that it takes a person to comprehend the context of the original text with a reasonable degree of probability. It is certainly true that even purely human-generated translations are prone to error; therefore, to ensure that a machine-generated translation will be useful to a human being and that publishable-quality translation is achieved, such translations must be reviewed and edited by a human.{{efn|J.M. Cohen observes: "Scientific translation is the aim of an age that would reduce all activities to [[Technology|techniques]]. It is impossible however to imagine a literary-translation machine less complex than the human brain itself, with all its knowledge, reading, and discrimination."&lt;ref&gt;J.M. Cohen, "Translation", ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]'', 1986, vol. 27, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;}}  [[Claude Piron]] writes that machine translation, at its best, automates the easier part of a translator's job; the harder and more time-consuming part usually involves doing extensive research to resolve [[ambiguity|ambiguities]] in the [[source text]], which the [[grammatical]] and [[lexical (semiotics)|lexical]] exigencies of the target language require to be resolved.&lt;ref&gt;[[Claude Piron]], ''Le défi des langues'' (The Language Challenge), Paris, L'Harmattan, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Such research is a necessary prelude to the pre-editing necessary in order to provide input for machine-translation software, such that the output will not be [[garbage in garbage out|meaningless]].&lt;ref name="NIST"/&gt;

The weaknesses of pure [[machine translation]], unaided by human expertise, are [[Logology (science of science)#Artificial intelligence|those of artificial intelligence itself]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Marcus]], "Am I Human?:  Researchers need new ways to distinguish [[artificial intelligence]] from the natural kind", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 316, no. 3 (March 2017), pp. 58–63.&lt;/ref&gt;  Translator Mark Polizzotti holds that machine translation, by [[Google Translate]] and the like, is unlikely to threaten human translators anytime soon, because machines will never grasp nuance and [[connotation]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Emily Wilson (classicist)|Wilson, Emily]], "The Pleasures of Translation" (review of Mark Polizzotti, ''Sympathy for the Traitor:  A Translation Manifesto'', MIT Press, 2018, 182 pp.), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXV, no. 9 (24 May 2018), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary translation==
Translation of [[literature|literary works]] ([[novel]]s, [[short story|short stories]], [[theatre|plays]], [[poetry|poems]], etc.) is considered a literary pursuit in its own right. Notable in [[Canadian literature]] ''specifically'' as translators are figures such as [[Sheila Fischman]], [[Robert Dickson (writer)|Robert Dickson]], and [[Linda Gaboriau]]; and the Canadian [[Governor General's Awards]] annually present prizes for the best English-to-French and French-to-English literary translations.

Other writers, among many who have made a name for themselves as literary translators, include [[Vasily Zhukovsky]], [[Tadeusz Boy-Żeleński]], [[Vladimir Nabokov]], [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Robert Stiller]], [[Lydia Davis]], [[Haruki Murakami]], [[Achy Obejas]], and [[Jhumpa Lahiri]].

In the 2010s a substantial gender imbalance was noted in literary translation into English,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wordswithoutborders.org/dispatches/article/where-are-the-women-in-translation|title=Where Are the Women in Translation?|last=Anderson|first=Alison|date=May 14, 2013|website=Words Without Borders|access-date=July 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with far more male writers being translated than women writers. In 2014 Meytal Radzinski launched the ''Women in Translation'' campaign to address this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://literarytranslators.wordpress.com/2016/07/25/women-in-translation-an-interview-witth-meytal-radzinski/|title=Women in Translation: An Interview with Meytal Radzinski|date=25 July 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thebookseller.com/tags-bookseller/meytal-radzinski|title=Meytal Radzinski - The Bookseller|website=www.thebookseller.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biblibio.blogspot.com/2018/07/exclusion-is-choice-bias-in-best-of.html|title=Biblibio: Exclusion is a choice - Bias in "Best of" lists|first=Meytal|last=Radzinski|date=3 July 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
The first important translation in the West was that of the [[Septuagint]], a collection of [[Jew]]ish Scriptures translated into early [[Koine Greek]] in [[Alexandria]] between the 3rd and 1st centuries BCE. The dispersed [[Jew]]s had forgotten their ancestral language and needed Greek versions (translations) of their Scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;J.M. Cohen, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the [[Middle Ages]], [[Latin]] was the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the western learned world. The 9th-century [[Alfred the Great]], king of [[Wessex]] in [[England]], was far ahead of his time in commissioning [[vernacular]] [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] translations of [[Bede]]'s ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum|Ecclesiastical History]]'' and [[Boethius]]' ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]''. Meanwhile, the [[Christian Church]] frowned on even partial adaptations of [[St. Jerome]]'s ''[[Vulgate Bible|Vulgate]]'' of c. 384 CE,&lt;ref&gt;J.M Cohen, pp. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt; the standard [[Latin]] ''[[Bible]]''.

In [[Asia]], the spread of [[Buddhism]] led to large-scale ongoing translation efforts spanning well over a thousand years. The [[Tangut Empire]] was especially efficient in such efforts; exploiting the then newly invented [[block printing]], and with the full support of the government (contemporary sources describe the Emperor and his mother personally contributing to the translation effort, alongside sages of various nationalities), the Tanguts took mere decades to translate volumes that had taken the [[China|Chinese]] centuries to render.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

The [[Arabs]] undertook large-scale efforts at translation.  Having conquered the Greek world, they made [[Arabic]] versions of its philosophical and scientific works.  During the [[Middle Ages]], translations of some of these Arabic versions were made into Latin, chiefly at [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] in [[Spain]].&lt;ref name="Cohen13"&gt;J.M. Cohen, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  King Alfonso X el Sabio (Alphonse the Wise) of Castille in the 13th century promoted this effort by founding a ''Schola Traductorum'' (School of Translation) in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]].  There Arabic texts, Hebrew texts, and Latin texts were translated into the other tongues by Muslim, Jewish and Christian scholars, who also argued the merits of their respective religions.  Latin translations of Greek and original Arab works of scholarship and science helped advance European [[Scholasticism]], and thus European science and culture.
[[File:Chaucer Hoccleve.png|thumb|170px|[[Geoffrey Chaucer]]]]
The broad historic trends in Western translation practice may be illustrated on the example of translation into the [[English language]].

The first fine translations into English were made in the 14th century by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], who adapted from the [[Italian language|Italian]] of [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] in his own ''[[Knight's Tale]]'' and ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]''; began a translation of the [[French-language]] ''[[Roman de la Rose]]''; and completed a translation of [[Boethius]] from the [[Latin]]. Chaucer founded an English [[poetry|poetic]] tradition on ''[[Literary adaptation|adaptations]]'' and translations from those earlier-established [[literary language]]s.&lt;ref name=Cohen13/&gt;

The first great English translation was the ''[[Wycliffe Bible]]'' (c. 1382), which showed the weaknesses of an underdeveloped English [[prose]]. Only at the end of the 15th century did the great age of English prose translation begin with [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte Darthur]]''—an adaptation of [[Arthurian romance]]s so free that it can, in fact, hardly be called a true translation. The first great [[Tudor period|Tudor]] translations are, accordingly, the ''[[Tyndale Bible|Tyndale New Testament]]'' (1525), which influenced the ''[[Authorized Version]]'' (1611), and [[Lord Berners]]' version of [[Jean Froissart]]'s ''Chronicles'' (1523–25).&lt;ref name=Cohen13/&gt;
[[File:Portrait of Marsilio Ficino at the Duomo Firence 2.jpg|thumb|120px|[[Marsilio Ficino]]]]
Meanwhile, in [[Renaissance]] [[Italy]], a new period in the history of translation had opened in [[Florence]] with the arrival, at the court of [[Cosimo de' Medici]], of the [[Byzantine]] scholar [[Georgius Gemistus Pletho]] shortly before the fall of [[Constantinople]] to the Turks (1453). A Latin translation of [[Plato]]'s works was undertaken by [[Marsilio Ficino]]. This and [[Erasmus]]' Latin edition of the ''[[New Testament]]'' led to a new attitude to translation. For the first time, readers demanded rigor of rendering, as philosophical and religious beliefs depended on the exact words of [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]] and [[Jesus]].&lt;ref name=Cohen13/&gt;

Non-scholarly literature, however, continued to rely on ''adaptation''. [[France]]'s ''[[Pléiade]]'', [[England]]'s [[Tudor period|Tudor]] poets, and the [[Elizabethan]] translators adapted themes by [[Horace]], [[Ovid]], [[Petrarch]] and modern Latin writers, forming a new poetic style on those models. The English poets and translators sought to supply a new public, created by the rise of a [[middle class]] and the development of [[printing]], with works such as the original authors ''would have written'', had they been writing in England in that day.&lt;ref name=Cohen13/&gt;

The [[Elizabethan]] period of translation saw considerable progress beyond mere [[paraphrase]] toward an ideal of [[Stylistics (linguistics)|stylistic]] equivalence, but even to the end of this period, which actually reached to the middle of the 17th century, there was no concern for [[Words|verbal]] [[accuracy]].&lt;ref name=Cohen14&gt;J.M. Cohen, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second half of the 17th century, the poet [[John Dryden]] sought to make [[Virgil]] speak "in words such as he would probably have written if he were living and an Englishman". As great as Dryden's poem is, however, one is reading Dryden, and not experiencing the Roman poet's concision. Similarly, [[Homer]] arguably suffers from [[Alexander Pope]]'s endeavor to reduce the Greek poet's "wild paradise" to order. Both works live on as worthy ''English'' epics, more than as a point of access to the Latin or Greek.&lt;ref name=Cohen14/&gt;
[[File:Edward FitzGerald.jpg|thumb|left|130px|[[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward FitzGerald]]]]
Throughout the 18th century, the watchword of translators was ease of reading. Whatever they did not understand in a text, or thought might bore readers, they omitted. They cheerfully assumed that their own style of expression was the best, and that texts should be made to conform to it in translation. For scholarship they cared no more than had their predecessors, and they did not shrink from making translations from translations in third languages, or from languages that they hardly knew, or—as in the case of [[James Macpherson]]'s "translations" of [[Ossian]]—from texts that were actually of the "translator's" own composition.&lt;ref name=Cohen14/&gt;
[[File:Benjamin Jowett - Imagines philologorum.jpg|thumb|80px|[[Benjamin Jowett]]]]
The 19th century brought new standards of accuracy and style. In regard to accuracy, observes J.M. Cohen, the policy became "the text, the whole text, and nothing but the text", except for any [[bawdy]] passages and the addition of copious explanatory [[footnote]]s.{{efn|For instance, Henry Benedict Mackey's translation of [[St. Francis de Sales]]'s "[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/desales/love.html Treatise on the Love of God]" consistently omits the saint's analogies comparing God to a nursing mother, references to Bible stories such as the rape of Tamar, and so forth.}} In regard to style, the [[Victorians]]' aim, achieved through far-reaching [[metaphrase]] (literality) or ''pseudo''-metaphrase, was to constantly remind readers that they were reading a ''foreign'' classic. An exception was the outstanding translation in this period, [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward FitzGerald]]'s ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam|Rubaiyat]]'' of [[Omar Khayyam]] (1859), which achieved its Oriental flavor largely by using Persian names and discreet Biblical echoes and actually drew little of its material from the Persian original.&lt;ref name=Cohen14/&gt;

In advance of the 20th century, a new pattern was set in 1871 by [[Benjamin Jowett]], who translated [[Plato]] into simple, straightforward language. Jowett's example was not followed, however, until well into the new century, when accuracy rather than style became the principal criterion.&lt;ref name=Cohen14/&gt;

===Modern translation===
As a language evolves, texts in an earlier version of the language—original texts, or old translations—may become difficult for modern readers to understand. Such a text may therefore be translated into more modern language, producing a "modern translation" (e.g., a "modern English translation" or "modernized translation").

Such modern rendering is applied either to literature from classical languages such as [[Latin]] or [[Greek language|Greek]], notably to the [[Bible]] (see "[[Modern English Bible translations]]"), or to literature from an earlier stage of the same language, as with the works of [[William Shakespeare]] (which are largely understandable by a modern audience, though with some difficulty) or with [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s Middle English ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'' (which is understandable to most modern readers only through heavy dependence on footnotes).

Modern translation is applicable to any language with a long literary history.  For example, in Japanese the 11th-century ''[[The Tale of Genji|Tale of Genji]]'' is generally read in modern translation  (see "[[The Tale of Genji#Modern readership|''Genji:'' modern readership]]").

Modern translation often involves literary scholarship and textual revision, as there is frequently not one single canonical text. This is particularly noteworthy in the case of the Bible and Shakespeare, where modern scholarship can result in substantive textual changes.

Modern translation meets with opposition from some traditionalists.  In English, some readers prefer the [[Authorized King James Version]] of the Bible to modern translations, and Shakespeare in the original of c. 1600 to modern translations.

An opposite process involves translating modern literature into classical languages, for the purpose of [[extensive reading]] (for examples, see "[[List of Latin translations of modern literature]]").

===Poetry===
[[File:Hofstadter2002B.jpg|thumb|75px|[[Douglas Hofstadter|Hofstadter]]]]
[[File:Roman Jakobson.jpg|thumb|65px|[[Roman Jakobson|Jakobson]]]]
[[File:Vladimir Nabokov 1973.jpg|thumb|55px|[[Vladimir Nabokov|Nabokov]]]]
Views on the possibility of satisfactorily translating poetry show a broad spectrum, depending largely on the degree of latitude to be granted the translator in regard to a poem's formal features (rhythm, rhyme, verse form, etc.).  [[Douglas Hofstadter]], in his 1997 book, ''[[Le Ton beau de Marot]]'', argued that a good translation of a poem must convey as much as possible not only of its literal meaning but also of its form and structure (meter, rhyme or alliteration scheme, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;A discussion of Hofstadter's otherwise latitudinarian views on translation is found in Tony Dokoupil, "[http://www.newsweek.com/id/195684 Translation: Pardon My French: You Suck at This]," ''[[Newsweek]]'', May 18, 2009, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Russia]]n-born [[linguist]] and [[semiotician]] [[Roman Jakobson]], however, had in his 1959 paper "[[On Linguistic Aspects of Translation]]", declared that "poetry by definition [is] untranslatable".  [[Vladimir Nabokov]], another Russian-born author, took a view similar to Jakobson's.  He considered rhymed, metrical, versed poetry to be in principle untranslatable and therefore rendered his 1964 English translation of [[Alexander Pushkin]]'s [[Eugene Onegin#Into English|''Eugene Onegin'' in prose]].

Hofstadter, in ''[[Le Ton beau de Marot]]'', criticized Nabokov's attitude toward verse translation.  In 1999 Hofstadter published his own translation of ''Eugene Onegin'', in verse form.

Gregory Hays, in the course of discussing [[ancient Rome|Roman]] adapted translations of [[ancient Greek literature]], makes approving reference to some views on the translating of poetry expressed by [[David Bellos]], an accomplished French-to-English translator.  Hays writes:
{{blockquote|Among the ''idées reçues'' [received ideas] skewered by David Bellos is the old saw that "poetry is what gets lost in translation."  The saying is often attributed to [[Robert Frost]], but as Bellos notes, the attribution is as dubious as the idea itself.  A translation is an assemblage of words, and as such it can contain as much or as little poetry as any other such assemblage.  The [[Japanese people|Japanese]] even have a word (''chōyaku'', roughly "hypertranslation") to designate a version that deliberately improves on the original.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Hays, "Found in Translation" (review of [[Denis Feeney]], ''Beyond Greek:  The Beginnings of Latin Literature'', Harvard University Press), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXIV, no. 11 (22 June 2017), p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Book titles ===

Book-title translations can be either descriptive or symbolic. Descriptive book titles, for example [[Antoine de Saint-Exupéry]]'s ''[[Le Petit Prince]]''  (The Little Prince), are meant to be informative, and can name the protagonist, and indicate the theme of the book.  An example of a symbolic book title is [[Stieg Larsson]]'s  ''[[The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]]'', whose original Swedish title is ''Män som hatar kvinnor''  (Men Who Hate Women).  Such symbolic book titles usually indicate the theme, issues, or atmosphere of the work.

When translators are working with long book titles, the translated titles are often shorter and indicate the theme of the book.&lt;ref&gt;Jiří Levý, ''The Art of Translation'', Philadelphia, John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2011, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plays ===

The translation of plays poses many problems such as the added element of actors, speech duration, translation literalness, and the relationship between the arts of drama and acting. Successful play translators are able to create language that allows the actor and the playwright to work together effectively.&lt;ref&gt;Harry G.

=== Chinese literature ===
In translating Chinese literature, translators struggle to find true fidelity in translating into the [[target language (translation)|target language]]. In ''The Poem Behind the Poem'', Barnstone argues that poetry "can't be made to sing through a mathematics that doesn't factor in the creativity of the translator".&lt;ref&gt;Frank Stewart, ''The Poem Behind the Poem'', Washington, Copper Canyon Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable piece of work translated into English is the ''[[Wen Xuan]]'', an anthology representative of major works of Chinese literature. Translating this work requires a high knowledge of the [[genre]]s presented in the book, such as poetic forms, various prose types including memorials, letters, proclamations, praise poems, edicts, and historical, philosophical and political disquisitions, threnodies and laments for the dead, and examination essays. Thus the literary translator must be familiar with the writings, lives, and thought of a large number of its 130 authors, making the ''Wen Xuan'' one of the most difficult literary works to translate.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Eoyang and Lin Yao-fu, ''Translating Chinese Literature'', Indiana University Press, 1995, pp. 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Translation generally, much as with [[Kurt Gödel]]'s [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|conception of mathematics]], requires, to varying extents, more information than appears in the page of text being translated.

===Sung texts===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Catherine Winkworth.PNG|thumb|left|100px|[[Catherine Winkworth]]]] --&gt;
Translation of a text that is sung in vocal music for the purpose of singing in another language—sometimes called "singing translation"—is closely linked to translation of poetry because most [[vocal music]], at least in the Western tradition, is set to [[Verse (popular music)|verse]], especially verse in regular patterns with [[rhyme]]. (Since the late 19th century, musical setting of [[prose]] and [[free verse]] has also been practiced in some [[art music]], though [[popular music]] tends to remain conservative in its retention of [[stanza]]ic forms with or without [[refrain]]s.) A rudimentary example of translating poetry for singing is church [[hymn]]s, such as the German [[chorale]]s translated into English by [[Catherine Winkworth]].{{efn|For another example of poetry translation, including translation of sung texts, see [http://vagalecs.narod.ru/ Rhymes from Russia].}}

Translation of sung texts is generally much more restrictive than translation of poetry, because in the former there is little or no freedom to choose between a versified translation and a translation that dispenses with verse structure. One might modify or omit rhyme in a singing translation, but the assignment of syllables to specific notes in the original musical setting places great challenges on the translator.  There is the option in prose sung texts, less so in verse, of adding or deleting a syllable here and there by subdividing or combining notes, respectively, but even with prose the process is almost like strict verse translation because of the need to stick as closely as possible to the original prosody of the sung melodic line.

Other considerations in writing a singing translation include repetition of words and phrases, the placement of rests and/or punctuation, the quality of vowels sung on high notes, and rhythmic features of the vocal line that may be more natural to the original language than to the target language. A sung translation may be considerably or completely different from the original, thus resulting in a [[contrafactum]].

Translations of sung texts—whether of the above type meant to be sung or of a more or less literal type meant to be read—are also used as aids to audiences, singers and conductors, when a work is being sung in a language not known to them. The most familiar types are translations presented as subtitles or [[surtitles]] projected during [[opera]] performances, those inserted into concert programs, and those that accompany commercial audio CDs of vocal music. In addition, professional and amateur singers often sing works in languages they do not know (or do not know well), and translations are then used to enable them to understand the meaning of the words they are singing.

===Religious texts===
{{Further|Bible translations|Quran translations}}

[[File:Domenico Ghirlandaio - St Jerome in his study.jpg|thumb|left|135px|[[Jerome]], [[patron saint]] of translators and [[encyclopedia|encyclopedists]]]]
An important role in history has been played by translation of religious texts. Such translations may be influenced by tension between the text and the religious values the translators wish to convey. For example, [[Buddhist]] [[monk]]s who translated the [[India]]n [[sutra]]s into [[Chinese language|Chinese]] occasionally adjusted their translations to better reflect [[China]]'s distinct [[culture]], emphasizing notions such as [[filial piety]].

One of the first recorded instances of translation in the West was the rendering of the [[Old Testament]] into [[Greek language|Greek]] in the 3rd century BCE. The translation is known as the "[[Septuagint]]", a name that refers to the supposedly seventy translators (seventy-two, in some versions) who were commissioned to translate the [[Bible]] at [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt]]. According to legend, each translator worked in solitary confinement in his own cell, and,  according to legend, all seventy versions proved identical. The ''Septuagint'' became the [[source text]] for later translations into many languages, including [[Latin]], [[Coptic language|Coptic]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Georgian language|Georgian]].

Still considered one of the greatest translators in history, for having rendered the ''[[Bible]]'' into [[Latin]], is [[Jerome]] (347–420 C.E.), the [[patron saint]] of translators. For centuries the [[Roman Catholic Church]] used his translation (known as the [[Vulgate]]), though even this translation stirred controversy.  By contrast with Jerome's contemporary, [[Augustine of Hippo]] (354–430 C.E.), who endorsed precise translation, Jerome believed in adaptation, and sometimes invention, in order to more effectively bring across the meaning.  Jerome's colorful Vulgate translation of the Bible includes some crucial instances of "overdetermination".  For example, [[Isaiah]]'s prophecy announcing that the Savior will be born of a virgin, uses the word '''almah'', which is also used to describe the dancing girls at [[Solomon]]'s court, and simply means young and nubile.  Jerome, writes [[Marina Warner]], translates it as ''virgo'', "adding divine authority to the virulent cult of [[sex]]ual disgust that shaped Christian moral theology (the [Moslem] ''[[Quran]]'', free from this linguistic trap, does not connect [[Maryam (name)|Mariam]]/[[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]]'s miraculous nature with moral horror of sex)."  The [[apple]] that [[Eve]] offered to [[Adam]], according to Mark Polizzotti, could equally well have been an [[apricot]], [[orange (fruit)|orange]], or [[banana]]; but Jerome liked the [[pun]] ''malus/malum'' (apple/evil}.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marina Warner]], "The Politics of Translation" (a review of [[Kate Briggs]], ''This Little Art'', 2017; [[Mireille Gansel]], translated by [[Ros Schwartz]], 2017; [[Mark Polizzotti]], ''Sympathy for the Traitor:  A Translation Manifesto'', 2018; [[Boyd Tonkin]], ed., ''The 100 Best Novels in Translation'', 2018; [[Clive Scott (linguist)|Clive Scott]], ''The Work of Literary Translation'', 2018), ''[[London Review of Books]]'', vol. 40, no. 19 (11 October 2018), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Pope Francis]] has suggested that the phrase "lead us not into temptation", in the [[Lord's Prayer]] found in the [[Gospel of Matthew|Gospels of Matthew]] (the first Gospel, written c. 80–90 C.E.) and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] (the third Gospel, written c. 80–110 C.E.), should more properly be translated, "do not let us fall into temptation", commenting that God does not lead people into temptation—[[Satan]] does.{{efn|MJC Warren, Lecturer in Biblical and Religious Studies, [[University of Sheffield]], points out (more explicitly than Charles McNamara) that Luke gives a shorter version of [[Jesus]]'s Lord's Prayer, leaving off the request that God "deliver us from evil"; that (as Charles McNamara also says) accurate translation is not the question here; and that the Bible records a number of incidents when God commands evil actions, such as that [[Abraham]] kill his only son, [[Isaac]] (whose execution is canceled at the last moment).&lt;ref&gt;MJC Warren, "‘Lead us not into temptation’: why Pope Francis is wrong about the Lord’s Prayer", ''[[The Conversation]]'', December 8, 2017 [https://theconversation.com/lead-us-not-into-temptation-why-pope-francis-is-wrong-about-the-lords-prayer-88886]&lt;/ref&gt;}}  Some important early Christian authors interpreted the Bible's Greek text and [[Jerome]]'s [[Latin Vulgate]] similarly to Pope Francis.  A.J.B. Higgins&lt;ref&gt;A.J.B. Higgins, "'Lead Us Not into Temptation':  Some Latin Variants", ''[[Journal of Theological Studies]]'', 1943.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1943 showed that among the earliest Christian authors, the understanding and even the text of this devotional verse underwent considerable changes.  These ancient writers suggest that, even if the Greek and Latin texts are left unmodified, something like "do not let us fall" could be an acceptable English rendering.  Higgins cited [[Tertullian]], the earliest of the Latin [[Church Fathers]] (c. 155–c. 240 C.E., "do not allow us to be led") and [[Cyprian]] (c. 200–258 C.E., "do not allow us to be led into temptation").  A later author, [[Ambrose]] (C. 340–397 C.E.), followed Cyprian's interpretation.  [[Augustine of Hippo]] (354–430), familiar with Jerome's Latin Vulgate rendering, observed that "many people... say it this way:  'and do not allow us to be led into temptation.'"&lt;ref&gt;Charles McNamara, "Lead Us Not into Temptation?  Francis Is Not the First to Question a Key Phrase of the Lord's Prayer", ''[[Commonweal (magazine)|Commonweal]]'', January 1, 2018.  [https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/lead-us-not-temptation]&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 863 C.E. the brothers [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]], the [[Byzantine Empire]]'s "Apostles to the Slavs", began translating parts of the [[Bible]] into the [[Old Church Slavonic]] language, using the [[Glagolitic script]] that they had devised, based on the [[Greek alphabet]].

The periods preceding and contemporary with the [[Protestant Reformation]] saw translations of the [[Bible]] into [[vernacular]] (local) European languages—a development that contributed to [[Western Christianity]]'s split into [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] and [[Protestantism]] over disparities between Catholic and Protestant renderings of crucial words and passages (and due to a Protestant-perceived need to reform the Roman Catholic Church).  Lasting effects on the religions, cultures, and languages of their respective countries were exerted by such [[Bible]] translations as [[Martin Luther]]'s into [[German language|German]] (the [[New Testament]], 1522), [[Jakub Wujek]]'s into [[Polish language|Polish]] (1599, as revised by the [[Jesuits]]), and [[William Tyndale]]'s (New Testament, 1526 and revisions) and the ''[[King James Version]]'' into [[English language|English]] (1611). 
[[File:Moses (Michaelangelo - San Pietro in Vincoli - Rome).jpg|thumb|left|140px|right|Mistranslation: [[Michelangelo]]'s horned [[Moses]]]]
Efforts to translate the Bible into English had their [[martyr]]s. [[William Tyndale]] (c. 1494–1536) was convicted of [[heresy]] at [[Antwerp]], was strangled to death while tied at the stake, and then his dead body was burned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Farris |first=Michael |title=From Tyndale to Madison |year=2007 |page=37}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Earlier, [[John Wycliffe]] (c. mid-1320s – 1384) had managed to die a natural death, but 30 years later the [[Council of Constance]] in 1415 declared him a heretic and decreed that his works and earthly remains should be burned; the order, confirmed by [[Pope Martin V]], was carried out in 1428, and Wycliffe's corpse was exhumed and burned and the ashes cast into the [[River Swift]].  Debate and religious [[schism]] over different translations of religious texts continue, as demonstrated by, for example, the [[King James Only movement]].

A famous ''mistranslation'' of a [[Biblical]] text is the rendering of the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word {{lang|he|קֶרֶן|rtl=yes}} (''keren''), which has several meanings, as "horn" in a context where it more plausibly means "beam of light":  as a result, for centuries artists, including sculptor [[Michelangelo]], have rendered [[Moses|Moses the Lawgiver]] with horns growing from his forehead.
[[File:Chinese quran.jpg|thumb|100px|[[Chinese language|Chinese]] translation, verses 33–34 of ''Quran'''s [[Ya Sin|''surah'' (chapter) 36]]]]
Such fallibility of the translation process has contributed to the [[Islamic]] world's ambivalence about translating the ''[[Quran]]'' (also spelled ''Koran'') from the original [[Arabic]], as received by the prophet [[Muhammad]] from [[Allah]] (God) through the angel [[Gabriel]] incrementally between 609 and 632 C.E., the year of Muhammad's death.  During prayers, the ''Quran'', as the miraculous and inimitable word of Allah, is recited only in Arabic.  However, as of 1936, it had been translated into at least 102 languages.&lt;ref name = fatani&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first =Afnan|last = Fatani|title =Translation and the Qur'an|editor-link =Oliver Leaman|editor-first = Oliver| editor-last = Leaman|encyclopedia=The Qur'an:  An Encyclopaedia|publisher = Routledge|date = 2006|pages = 657–669|isbn = 978-0415775298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A fundamental difficulty in translating the ''Quran'' accurately stems from the fact that an Arabic word, like a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] or [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] word, may have a [[Polysemy|range of meanings]], depending on [[Context (language use)|context]].  This is said to be a linguistic feature, particularly of all [[Semitic languages]], that adds to the usual similar difficulties encountered in translating between any two languages.&lt;ref name = fatani/&gt;  There is always an element of human judgment—of interpretation—involved in understanding and translating a text.  Muslims regard any translation of the ''Quran'' as but one possible interpretation of the [[Classical Arabic|Quranic (Classical) Arabic]] text, and not as a full equivalent of that divinely communicated original.  Hence such a translation is often called an "interpretation" rather than a translation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Malise Ruthven]], ''Islam in the World'', Granta, 2006, p. 90, {{ISBN|978-1-86207-906-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

To complicate matters further, as with other languages, the meanings and usages of some expressions have changed ''over time'', between the Classical Arabic of the ''Quran'', and modern Arabic.  Thus a modern Arabic speaker may misinterpret the meaning of a word or passage in the ''Quran''.  Moreover, the interpretation of a Quranic passage will also depend on the historic context of Muhammad's life and of his early community.  Properly researching that context requires a detailed knowledge of ''[[hadith]]'' and ''[[Prophetic biography|sirah]]'', which are themselves vast and complex texts.  Hence, analogously to the translating of [[Translation#Chinese literature|Chinese literature]], an attempt at an accurate translation of the ''Quran'' requires a knowledge not only of the Arabic language and of the [[Target language (translation)|target language]], including their respective evolutions, but also a deep understanding of the two [[culture]]s involved.

== Technical translation ==
{{main|Technical translation}}
[[Technical translation]] renders documents such as manuals, instruction sheets, internal memos, minutes, financial reports, and other documents for a limited audience (who are directly affected by the document) and whose useful life is often limited.  Thus, a user guide for a particular model of refrigerator is useful only for the owner of the refrigerator, and will remain useful only as long as that refrigerator model is in use.  Similarly, software documentation generally pertains to a particular software, whose applications are used only by a certain class of users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Byrne |first=Jody|year=2006 |title=Technical Translation: Usability Strategies for Translating Technical Documentation |publisher=Springer |location=Dordrecht}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Emmanuel Abraham''', also known as '''Willie E. Abraham''' or, to give his [[Akan names|day name]], '''Kojo Abraham''' (born therefore on a Monday, May 28, 1934) is a retired Ghanaian philosopher.

==Biography==
Abraham was educated at the Government Boys' School and [[Adisadel College|Adisadel Secondary School]] in [[Cape Coast, Ghana]]. He obtained a BA from the [[University of Ghana]], graduating with first-class honors in philosophy in 1957.&lt;ref name="Mobley1970"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mobley|first=Harris W.|title=The Ghanaian's image of the missionary: an analysis of the published critiques of Christian missionaries by Ghanaians, 1897-1965, by Harris W.

On his return to Ghana in 1962 he joined the Department of Philosophy at the University of Ghana, and published his book ''The Mind of Africa'', a philosophical work arguing for [[Pan-Africanism]]. He was elected Vice-President of the [[Ghana Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1963,&lt;ref name="Mobley1970"/&gt; in that capacity visiting scientific facilities in the Soviet Union in a seven-week tour in the summer of 1963. He became a close associate of [[Kwame Nkrumah]], collaborating on Nkrumah's work ''Consciencism'', published in 1964.&lt;ref name=UnivGhana/&gt; Abraham replaced [[Conor Cruise O'Brien]] as Vice-Chancellor of the University of Ghana in September 1965.&lt;ref name="Mobley1970"/&gt; He also chaired a commission that reported in 1964 on "alleged irregularities and malpractices in connection with the issue of import licences", and was a non-resident lecturer in African Studies at the [[Kwame Nkrumah Ideological Institute]] from 1963 until its closure in 1966. 

However, identified as "Nkrumah's court philosopher", Abraham was arrested in the [[National Liberation Council#1966 coup|1966 coup]] which established [[Joseph Arthur Ankrah]] as President.&lt;ref name="Gaines2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kevin Kelly Gaines|title=American Africans in Ghana: Black Expatriates and the Civil Rights Era|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TyM9WgZChF0C&amp;pg=PA230|year=2006|publisher=UNC Press Books|isbn=978-0-8078-3008-6|page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He emigrated to the United States and held academic positions at [[Macalaster College]] and the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], where he is currently Professor Emeritus of Philosophy. He has had a life-long interest in the life and work of the eighteenth-century Ghanaian philosopher, [[Anton Wilhelm Amo]].

}}'''Yves Marie André ''' (1675–1764), also known as '''le Père André''',  was a French [[Jesuit]] [[mathematician]], [[philosopher]], and [[essayist]].

André entered the Society of Jesus in 1693. Although distinguished in his scholastic studies, he adhered to [[Gallicanism]] and [[Jansenism]] and was thus considered unsuitable for responsible office by Church authorities. He therefore pursued scientific studies and became royal professor of mathematics at Caen.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Yves Marie André}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is best known for his ''Essai sur le Beau'' (''Essay on Beauty''), a 1741 philosophical work on [[aesthetics]], which made him famous at the time and remained a well-known work into the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;André, ''Essai sur le Beau'' in ''Œuvres Philosophiques'' (Paris: Adolphe Delahays, 1843).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zero balancing''' is a type of [[manual therapy]] devised by Frederick "Fritz" Smith in the 1970s. Smith proposed that a kind of [[energy (vitalism)|energy field]] within the human body could be affected by bodily manipulations, so bringing health benefits. The practice teaches that currents of [[Energy (esotericism)|energy]] are stored within the human skeleton, and that these affect both physical and mental wellbeing.

Zero balancing is [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]].&lt;ref name=jb/&gt;

== Description ==
According to Frederick Smith, the founder of zero balancing,&lt;blockquote&gt;"Zero balancing teaches that the deepest currents of energy are in bone, that memory can be held in tissue, that energy fields in the body underlie mind, body and emotions, and that imbalances in the field precede pathology".&lt;ref name=fritz&gt;Fritz Frederick Smith ''quoted at'' {{cite web |title=About Zero Balancing |url=http://www.zerobalancing.com/about/history_founder |accessdate=July 2016 |publisher=Zero Balancing Health Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Zero Balancing Health Association say that zero balancing "uses skilled touch to address the relationship between energy and structures of the body".&lt;ref name=jb/&gt;

The concept underlying zero balancing is based on [[vitalism]] and it is a type of [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref name=jb/&gt; Skeptic and lawyer Jann Bellamy has written that zero balancing is "a perfect example of how a promoter can fabricate a treatment and sell it to credulous clients and practitioners".&lt;ref name=jb&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Science-Based Medicine |title=Massage Therapy rubs me the wrong way |url=https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/massage-therapy-rubs-me-the-wrong-way/ |date=17 September 2015 |author=Bellamy J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:FSmith.zerobalancefounder.jpg|thumb|Fritz Smith, founder of zero balancing]]
Fritz Smith was born in 1929, trained and licensed as an [[doctor of osteopathic medicine|Osteopathic Physician]] and [[Surgeon]] in 1955 and received an M.D. in 1961 in the state of [[California]].&lt;ref name=Calvert&gt;{{cite news |last1=Calvert |first1= Robert |last2= Calvert |first2= Judy |title= Interview with Frederick "Fritz" Smith, M.D |magazine= Massage Magazine |year= 1994 |page= 40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1960s, Smith studied with several teachers at the [[Esalen Institute]] in Northern California, among them [[Ida Pauline Rolf]], founder of [[Rolfing|Rolfing Structural Integration]] and [[J. R. Worsley]], founder of the College of Traditional Chinese Acupuncture in [[London]], England. Under Worsley, Smith became the first American to earn the Diploma of Acupuncture at the College of Traditional Chinese Acupuncture in London, in 1972.&lt;ref name=Calvert/&gt; He also studied with Swami [[Muktananda]], the founder of [[Siddha Yoga]].&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite book |last= Smith |first= Fritz Frederick |title= Inner Bridges – A Guide to Energy Movement and Body Structure |year= 1986 |page= 89 |isbn= 0893340863}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith began to integrate principles of traditional Chinese medicine with his osteopathic and Structural Integration training. This led him to develop the manual touch therapy system of zero balancing&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt; in the early 1970s.&lt;ref name="Geggus"&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1016/S1360-8592(03)00066-4 |title=Introduction to the concepts of Zero Balancing |year= 2004 |last1= Geggus |first1= Pam |journal= Journal of Bodywork and Movement Therapies |volume= 8|page = 58}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name came about when someone receiving his work described their feeling after the experience as "I feel so well-balanced, like I'm zero; zero-balanced."&lt;ref name=Beaumont&gt;{{citation |last= Beaumont |first= Richard |title= Zero Balancing |work= Kindred Spirit |year= 1991 |page= 27 |postscript= .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith is the author of many articles and two books, ''Inner Bridges: A Guide to Energy Movement and Body Structure'' and ''Alchemy of Touch: Moving Towards Mastery Through the Lens of Zero Balancing.''&lt;ref name=Lauterstein&gt;{{cite news |last= Lauterstein |first= David |title= Reflections, a conversation with Fritz Smith on Zero Balancing |magazine= Massage and Bodywork |date=May–June 2009 |page= 79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training==
[[File:Fulcrum into skeletal foot.zero balancing tutorial.JPG|thumb|right|Tutorial image showing common element with zero balancing's work on the bones of the feet]]
In 2004 [[The Times]] reported that becoming a zero balancing practitioner required less time than many other therapies, about 15 days of classroom time plus additional case work and supervised sessions.&lt;ref name="Times2004"&gt;{{cite news|title=What's the evidence? Zero-balancing|last=Murcott|first=Toby|date=24 July 2004|newspaper=[[The Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2009}} there were about 700 practitioners.&lt;ref name=Lauterstein/&gt;

== Reception ==
The practice is considered a [[placebo]] by skeptics.&lt;ref name="sf"&gt;{{cite web|last1=May|first1=Meredith|title=Zero Balancing touch therapy heals pain|url=http://www.sfgate.com/health/article/Zero-Balancing-touch-therapy-heals-pain-4247526.php|website=SFGate}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Clinical professor and orthopedic surgeon Richard Coughlin said: "I'm a bone doctor and what's in there is all circulatory; I'm less likely to think my sensory input is coming from my pelvis."&lt;ref name="sf"/&gt;

[[QuackWatch]] lists the Zero Balancing Association as one of about 750 "questionable organizations."&lt;ref name=quackwatch&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.quackwatch.com/04ConsumerEducation/nonrecorg.html |title=Questionable Organizations: An Overview |first= Stephen |last= Barrett |authorlink= Stephen Barrett |publisher= [[QuackWatch]] |date= 9 May 2013 |accessdate= May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
