'''Abed Abdi''' ({{lang-ar|عبد عابدي}}, {{lang-he|עבד עאבדי}}; born February 1942, [[Haifa]], [[Mandate Palestine]]) is an [[Arab Palestinian|Arab]] [[Palestinian Muslims|Palestinian]] painter, graphic designer, sculptor and art lecturer.

Abdi worked as a [[blacksmith]] and illustrated [[Arabic language|Arabic]] publications that appeared in Israel. After studying in Dresden, Abdi became the first Palestinian to build monumental art on native soil. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}} His allegorical monuments in Galilee, honoring human fortitude and resistance, include a narrative mural depicting Elijah's defiance and survival and a [[bronze]] [[Land Day]] memorial.

Abdi held his first exhibition in [[Tel Aviv]] in 1962. He then pursued academic studies at the Fine Arts Academy in [[Dresden]] (Germany). His professors were L.Grundig, G. Bondzin and G. Kettner. His [[masterwork]] at the Academy received the 2nd prize, which allowed Abdi to spend another year at the Academy and specialize in [[mural]]s and [[environmental sculpture]].
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:MT C 00025 04.JPG|thumb]] --&gt;
In 1972 he returned to Haifa, and worked as graphic designer for a number of Arabic language publications, taught arts and designed murals. The city of Haifa awarded Abdi the "Herman Struck Best Artist of the Year" Prize in 1973. That year, he also obtained the Young Artist's award at the [[Berlin International Youth Festival]]. The city of Haifa awarded him the "Best Artist of the Year Hermann Struck" award for the second time in 1999.

Abed Abdi has erected a number of memorial monuments and murals: in 1976—a sculpture to commemorate Land Day; in 1984—the memorial to commemorate 75 years for the existence of the Galilean municipality of [[Shefa Amr]]. In addition, he has painted a number of murals in Haifa, Jaffa and Nazareth.

Abed Abdi has exhibited in Qatar, Israel, Belgium and Bulgaria. He has participated in over 45 group exhibitions, among them the joint Palestinian-Israeli exhibition "It's possible" which toured the US and Germany between 1988 and 1990. In 1995 he participated in the second exhibition for Palestinians and Israelis in Germany. His work appeared in the "Solidarity with the Palestinian People" exhibit in Tokyo, Berlin, Brussels, Belgrade and Athens. He also organized and participated in exhibitions with Israeli and Palestinian artists in Tel-Aviv, Haifa and West Jerusalem in the period between 1980 and 1987 defending the freedom of expression and creativity.

Abdi is an active member of the Haifa branch of the [[Israeli Association of Painters and Sculpturers|Israeli Association of Painters and Sculptures]], as well as the [[Jewish-Arab Center of Beit Hagefen]]. This has enabled him to unite Palestinian and Israeli artists, and organize joint exhibitions, bringing the prospects of peace closer.  Abdi founded the Ibda' society for the promotion of visual arts in the Arab Israeli sector and Ara belle - Visual Arts Workshop in Haifa, for the promotion of the visual arts and intercultural dialogue through the arts. Abdi is president of Al Midan Theater in Haifa. He has been teaching fine arts in the Arab Pedagogical College in Haifa since 1985.

'''Artmedia''' was one of the first scientific projects concerning the relationship between art, technology, philosophy and [[aesthetics]]. It was founded in 1985 at the [[University of Salerno]]. For over two decades, until 2009, dozens of projects, studies, exhibitions and conferences on new technologies&lt;ref&gt;In addition to the ten international "Artmedia" conferences, which took place in Salerno and Paris from 1985 to 2008, the Laboratory has led to numerous other initiatives and events, such as "L'immaginario tecnologico", 1984 (conference and exhibition); "Technettronica", 1989 (Exhibition about the Aesthetics of Communication); "Estetica e antropologia", 1983 (International Symposium); "Tecnologie e forme nell'arte e nella scienza", 2003 (International Symposium); "New Technologies: Roy Ascott, Maurizio Bolognini, Fred Forest, Richard Kriesche, Mit Mitropoulos", Museo del Sannio, 2003 (Exhibition on the Aesthetics of Communication); "Estetica e tecnologia", 1987 (Symposium); "L'immateriale in piazza" (Aitiani, Forest, Mitropoulos, Grossi, Prado), Naples, 1992 (Exhibition on the Aesthetics of Communication); "Un'estetica per i media" 1989 (RAI, Dipartimento Scuola Educazione, TV program); "Cartacarbone", 1990 (radio program); "Coincidences", 1995 (Aesthetics journal, in French); "Epiphaneia", 1995-1996 (Aesthetics journal, in Italian). See ''Edition spéciale Artmedia'', "Art Press", Paris, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; made Artmedia a reference point for many internationally renowned scholars and artists,&lt;ref&gt;A. R., ''Des hauts et débats. Colloque Artmedia VIII'', "Liberation", November 29, 2002, p. 13; ''Dossier: De l’esthétique de la communication au Net Art'', "Art Press", 285, November 2002, pp. 37-43.&lt;/ref&gt; and contributed to the growing cultural interest in the aesthetics of [[New media|media]], the aesthetics of [[Computer network|networks]], and their [[ethical]] and [[Anthropology|anthropological]] implications.

==Beginnings and international events==
Since the late 1970s, a permanent ''Seminar of the Aesthetics of Media and Communication'' has been directed by its founder [[Mario Costa (philosopher)|Mario Costa]] at the University of Salerno. The basic principles of the aesthetics of technological communication were identified and conceptualized in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;The history of the "aesthetics of communication", especially upon its debut in the 1980s, is recorded in the book by Mario Costa,''The Aesthetics of Communication. Aesthetic use of simultaneity at a distance'', Rome, Castelvecchi, 1999; its basic principles, formulated by Costa, were expressed for the first time in ''News and Notes'', published by the International Center of Aesthetic Communication, Salerno, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; A conference on "Technological Imaginary", held in 1984 at the Museo del Sannio in [[Benevento]], discussed the issue of the new relationship between art and technology and the consequent need to re-evaluate aesthetics, warning that "all our future existence will be played at the crossroads between technology and imaginary".&lt;ref&gt;"Aa. Vv., ''L’immaginario tecnologico'', Museo del Sannio, Benevento, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The comprehensive relationship between art and [[technoscience]], technology, and philosophy has also been the theoretical subject of the ten international "Artmedia" conferences which were held in Salerno and Paris between 1985 and 2008. Particularly relevant were conferences held in Paris between 2002 and 2008, which took place at the [[Ecole Normale Supérieure]], the [[Bibliotheque Nationale de France]] (BNF) and the Institut National d'Histoire de l 'Art (INHA), with the partnership of the Société Française d'Esthétique, the [[Université du Québec à Montréal]], the [[University of Toronto]], the [[Universidade de São Paulo]], the [[Sorbonne University|Université de Paris 1 Sorbonne]], and the U.S. magazine [[Leonardo (journal)|Leonardo]].&lt;ref&gt;See Mario Costa, Fred Forest (eds) (2011), ''Ethique, esthétique, communication technologique dans l'art contemporain ou le destin du sens'', Paris: Institut National Audiovisuel, Editions L'Harmattan, and ''Dossier Artmedia VIII'', in "Ligeia", Paris, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Continuous debate between artists and theorists==
[[Image:DeKerckhove Berger Costa ArtmediaIV 1992.JPG|right|thumb|[[Derrick de Kerckhove]], [[René Berger]] and [[Mario Costa (philosopher)|Mario Costa]], Artmedia IV (1992)]]
[[Image:Bolognini Kriesche Costa Kac ArtmediaVII 1999.JPG|right|thumb|[[Maurizio Bolognini]], Richard Kriesche, [[Mario Costa (philosopher)|Mario Costa]] and [[Eduardo Kac]], Artmedia VII (1999)]]
Artmedia wanted to gather theorists and artists from all over the world and encourage both joint and complementary work, beginning with the need to give attention to theoretical and artistic practices and developing both together. These also contributed towards spreading the spirit of the project, both in a number of festivals and shows, and through their own artworks and research.&lt;ref&gt;Antonella Fimiani, ''Arte &amp; tecnologia, la frontiera-Salerno'', in "Il Mattino", November 24, 1999, p. 23; Sylvie Lisiecki e Marie Saladin, ''Fenetrês sur les arts numériques'', in "Croniques de la Bibliothèque Nationale de France", 46, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Theorists who worked with Artmedia and participated in its activities included [[Bernard Stiegler]], [[René Berger]], [[Abraham Moles]], [[Derrick De Kerckhove]], [[Pierre Levy]], Gillo Dorfles, [[Paul Virilio]], [[Frank Popper]], [[Roger Malina]], Daniel Charles, José Jiménez, Anne Cauquelin, [[Edgar Morin]], [[Thierry de Duve]], [[Catherine Millet]], Filiberto Menna, Andreas Broeckmann, Rudolf zur Lippe, [[Edmond Couchot]], Dominique Chateau, Yannick Geffroy, Philippe Queau, Arlindo Machado, Tetsuo Kogawa, and Bernard Teyssedre.

Artists included [[Fred Forest]], [[Roy Ascott]], [[Takahiko Iimura]], [[Maurizio Bolognini]], [[Tom Klinkowstein]], Tom Sherman, [[Eduardo Kac]], Enzo Minarelli, [[James Dashow]], [[Peter D'Agostino]], Mit Mitropoulos, [[Shawn Brixey]], Bruno Di Bello, [[Antoni Muntadas]], [[Orlan]], Kit Galloway, [[David Rokeby]], [[Miguel Chevalier]], [[Norman White]], Richard Kriesche, Olivier Auber, [[Caterina Davinio]] and [[Casey Reas]].&lt;ref&gt;On the participation of artists and theorists, see in particular: Mario Costa, Fred Forest (eds) (2011), ''Ethique, esthétique, communication technologique dans l'art contemporain ou le destin du sens'', Paris: Institut National Audiovisuel, Editions L'Harmattan; Mario Costa (ed.) (2004), ''New Technologies: [[Roy Ascott]], Maurizio Bolognini, [[Fred Forest]], Richard Kriesche, Mit Mitropoulos'', Salerno: Artmedia, Museo del Sannio; ''Dossier Artmedia VIII'', in "Ligeia", Paris, 2002, pp. 21-245; ''Edition spéciale Artmedia'', "Art Press", Paris, 2002; see also the OLATS/Leonardo websites: http://www.olats.org/projetpart/artmedia/2002/mono_index.php and http://www.olats.org/projetpart/artmedia/2008/mono_index.php .&lt;/ref&gt;

The questions raised in various projects promoted by Artmedia, in a continuous dialogue between artists and theorists, led to discussions on topics including ''Aesthetics of Communication and the anthropology of the future'' (1985), ''Global aesthetic communication'' (1986), ''Electronic performativity and the art system'' (1990), ''Neo-technological arts between aesthetics and communication'' (1992), ''Aesthetic research and technology'' (1995), ''Developments in aesthetics: change or mutation?'' (1999), ''From the Aesthetics of Communication to Net art'' (2002), and ''Ethics, aesthetics and techno-communication. The future of meaning'' (2008).

All Artmedia symposiums have been followed by many publications. For the two held in Paris, a complete video recording is also available, and can be viewed at the [[Institut National de l'Audiovisuel]].

An assessment of 25 years of Artmedia activity was made into a seminar on ''The aesthetic object of the future'', held at the [[University of Salerno]] in 2009. The Artmedia project produced a large number of publications and documents that are being catalogued, with a view to their proper placement and use.

"'''Big Beautiful Woman'''" (commonly abbreviated as '''BBW''') is a euphemism for an overweight woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schwimmer|first=Jeffrey|title=Preventing Childhood Obesity: Health in the Balance|pmc=1281327|publisher=National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S. National Library of Medicine|page=A706|volume=113|issue=10|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|doi=10.1289/ehp.113-a706a|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms "Big Beautiful Women" and "BBW" were coined by Carole Shaw in 1979, when she launched ''BBW Magazine'', a fashion and [[lifestyle magazine]] for "[[Plus-size model|plus-size]]" women.&lt;ref name=BBWMH&gt;{{Cite web |last= |first= |title=BBW Past &amp; Present |url=http://www.bbwmagazine.com/bbw-past-present/|accessdate=2015-08-05 |postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Meaning==
[[File:Fa attraction.svg|thumb|Physical attraction of 47 male fat admirers (FA) towards 10 female figures from the given [[Body mass index|BMI]] range, compared with a control group (CG)]]
The term is a subjective, visually determined concept that does not have an explicit lower or upper weight limitation, and may denote women who may be considered barely overweight to those who are [[morbidly obese]]. A 2009 study found that male fat admirers preferred females that were clinically overweight and rated both overweight and obese women more positively than slighter individuals. The study also found that participants reacted more positively to a much wider range of figures than a control group, even rating emaciated figures higher. It concludes "these findings suggest that an explanation for fat admiration may be that FAs are rejecting sociocultural norms of attractiveness".&lt;ref name="Swami"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Swami|first=Viren|date=1 January 2009|title=Big beautiful women: the body size preferences of male fat admirers|url=https://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/m.j.tovee/Swami+Tovee-2009.pdf|journal=The Journal of Sex Research|volume=46|issue=1|pages=89–96|doi=10.1080/00224490802645302|pmid=19116865|author2=Tovee, Martin J.|accessdate=25 November 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623142133/https://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/m.j.tovee/Swami%2BTovee-2009.pdf|archivedate=23 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has several near-synonyms with varying shades of meaning:
*''Full-figured'' or ''Rubenesque'' - the latter term referring to the art of [[Peter Paul Rubens]], best known for portraying full-bodied women.
*''[[wikt:voluptuous|voluptuous]]'' and ''[[wikt:zaftig|zaftig]]'' usually connote ripeness, sensuality, and a [[body shape]] involving large breasts and wide hips, although in such women the [[waist-hip ratio]] is generally smaller indicating only slightly overweight or normal weight status

==Usage==
Although "BBW" may have been first used in the context of BBW Magazine, the term's usage spread over the years, to the point that even women who had never heard of the magazine began to refer to themselves as "BBWs".

{{wikinews|Obesity and the Fat Acceptance Movement: Kira Nerusskaya speaks}}

Some women may adopt the term as a personal preference over the term ''Rubenesque'', or ''full-figured'', because they may not necessarily have large breasts or hips. Such terms, and others such as "[[Bed (furniture)#Standard sizes|queen-sized]]", "[[Plus-size model|plus-sized]]", or "fat" may lead to feelings of marginalization or non-inclusion for some women. However, some strongly prefer the term ''fat'' over other words which they consider unnecessary [[euphemism]]s.

The abbreviation BBW can often be found used in [[personal ad]]s (and [[online dating service]]s) denoting an identification with (or preference for) such women, and is also used to denote events specifically targeted to such women, and persons interested in them, such as specific gathering nights in dance clubs, restaurants, and fashion stores and shows.

The term is also commonly used as a positive euphemism by those involved with the [[fat acceptance movement]].

== Websites ==
There are a wide range of websites dedicated to the topic of big beautiful woman, including sites which are dedicated to sending out a size-positive message towards larger women, some of which denounce the dieting industry as encouraging women to lose weight to conform to what is considered the ideal by mainstream society. Big beautiful women are also on a number of [[pornographic]] websites which may include content which is [[sexual fetish|sexually fetishistic]] in nature (including [[fat fetishism]] and [[Fat fetishism#Feederism|feederism]]).

== Variants ==
The acronym BBBW refers to Big Beautiful Black Woman.  Another variant is SSBBW: Super-Size Big Beautiful Woman. There is much debate on a definition for a Super-Size Big Beautiful Woman.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

While "Big Beautiful Woman" may be prevalent in the Americas and Europe, in Asian countries where obesity may be considered uncommon or deemed unhealthy, other terms are used.  For example, in Japan the term ''[[wikt:en:debu#Japanese|debu]]'' (''katakana'' [[wikt:en:デブ#Japanese|デブ]], ''hiragana'' [[wikt:en:でぶ#Japanese|でぶ]]) is used, but usually with a pejorative meaning, whereas ''[[wikt:en:でぶ専#Japanese|debusen]]'' is the most common term used for sexual attraction to obese individuals. ''[[wikt:en:プランパー#Japanese|Plumper]]'', on the other hand, is a fetish in the popular ''[[bakunyū]]'' market of the pornographic scene.

===Big Handsome Man===
''Big Handsome Man'' (BHM), or ''Big Hulking Men'', or sometimes ''Big Beautiful Man'' (BBM),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NATB&amp;p_theme=natb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=12206D27A55B1088&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |publisher=North Adams Transcript |title=On the sunny side of the street |date=16 July 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to a physically or sexually attractive fat man. These men are large to extremely large. There are many subcategories of BHMs.  Some are men who just happen to be large, while others attempt to become fatter.  Some of these men are insecure about their size, while others embrace their [[obesity]] and feel confident.  Women who are attracted to BHMs are called ''Female Fat Admirers'' (FFA). In the gay community, BHMs are called [[chub (gay culture)|Chubs]], and men who are attracted to BHMs are known as [[Chubby chaser]]s.

'''Bookworm''' is a popular generalization for any [[insect]] that supposedly bores through [[book]]s.&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/animal/bookworm|title=Bookworm insect|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]], inc.|accessdate=April 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Distillations"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Wiener|first1=Ann Elizabeth  |title=What’s That Smell You’re Reading? |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/whats-that-smell-youre-reading |journal=Distillations |publisher=[[Science History Institute]]|date=2018|volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=36-39|accessdate=July 11, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Booklice==
A major book-feeding insect is the book or paper louse (also known as booklouse or paperlouse). These are tiny (under 1&amp;nbsp;mm), soft-bodied wingless ''[[Psocoptera]]ns'' (usually ''Trogium pulsatorium''), which actually feed on microscopic [[mold]]s and other organic matter found in ill-maintained works (e.g., cool, damp, dark, and undisturbed areas of archives, libraries, and museums), although they will also attack bindings and other book parts. The booklouse is not a true [[louse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colonialpest.com/bugs-that-eat-books/|title=Bugs That Eat Books!|publisher=Colonial Pest Control Inc.|accessdate=April 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the twentieth century, modern bookbinding materials thwarted much of the damage done to books by various types of book-boring insects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Stuart|title=The Library: An Illustrated History|year=2009|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing|location=New York, NY|page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''chansonnier''' ({{lang-ca|cançoner}}, {{lang-oc|cançonièr}}, [[Galician language|Galician]] and {{lang-pt|cancioneiro}}, {{lang-it|canzoniere}} or ''canzoniéro'', {{lang-es|cancionero}}) is a [[manuscript]] or printed book which contains a collection of [[chanson]]s, or [[polyphonic]] and [[Monophony|monophonic]] settings of songs, hence literally "[[songbook|song-books]]," although some manuscripts are so called even though they preserve the text but not the music (for example, the [[Cancioneiro da Vaticana]] and [[Cancioneiro da Biblioteca Nacional]], which contain the bulk of [[Galician-Portuguese lyric]]). The most important chansonniers contain lyrics, poems and songs of the [[troubadour]]s and [[trouvère]]s of the Middle Ages. Prior to 1420, many song-books contained both sacred and secular music, one exception being those containing the work of [[Guillaume de Machaut]]. Around 1420, sacred and secular music was segregated into separate sources, with large choirbooks containing sacred music, and smaller chansonniers for more private use by the privileged. Chansonniers were compiled primarily in [[France]], but also in [[Italy]], [[Germany]] and in the [[Iberian peninsula]].

The '''Chicago film industry''' is a central hub for motion picture production and exhibition that was established before [[Hollywood]] became the undisputed capital of film making.  In the early 1900s, [[Chicago]] boasted the greatest number of production companies and filmmakers.&lt;ref name="Lindstrom"/&gt;  [[Essanay Studios]] founded by [[George K. Spoor]] was one of the earliest successful studios to produce movies in Chicago, employing stars such as Charlie Chaplin and Gloria Swanson.  Actor and co-founder of Essanay Studios, [[Broncho Billy Anderson]] gave birth to the western genre.&lt;ref name="Scheetz"/&gt;  Early film companies such as Essanay Studios produced multiple silent films every week and rented viewing equipment to showcase the latest cinematography to the public. This rental culture gave birth to the popularity of Nickelodeons up until the [[Great Depression]]. However, due to the high demand for motion pictures during this time, a black market for films and equipment developed. The [[Motion Picture Patents Company]], established in 1909 as a conglomerate of the major studios, sought to eliminate all illegal use of patented film equipment. As a result, independent ventures entered the film scene. Independents drove the film industry to the west to avoid legal trouble with the trust of major film companies united under the Motion Picture Patents Company. The west offered fairer weather and scenery that better accommodated film making.  Not until the 1980s and early 21st century has Chicago experienced a film production revival. Blockbusters, such as ''[[Blues Brothers]]'', ''[[Sixteen Candles]]'', and ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'', have rejuvenated the Chicago film scene.&lt;ref name="Murphy"/&gt; In the 21st century, Chicago further experienced a film revival due to a tax bill the state of Illinois passed to give filmmakers a 30% tax break on production costs.

==Beginnings of the Chicago film industry==

===Essanay Studios===
[[File:Essanay.jpg|thumb|Essanay Studio]]
[[File:His new job.jpg|thumb|''His New Job'' featuring Charlie Chaplin at Essanay Studios, Chicago'']]

Essanay Studios was a Chicago pioneer film company established in 1907 by George K. Spoor and [[Broncho Billy Anderson]].  Originally named the Peerless Film Manufacturing Company, Spoor and Anderson changed the name to Essanay by combining the first two letters of their surnames. Located on the north side on Argyle Street in Chicago, the firm grew to one of the largest film companies in the world before the rise of Hollywood.&lt;ref name = "Scheetz"&gt;[https://www.linkedin.com/in/scheetz Scheetz, George] (1974). ''[https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Chicago_Film_Industry.html?id=r8fWXwAACAAJ The Chicago Film Industry: Beginnings to 1918]''. Dissertation, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign English Department. Urbana.&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of Essanay Studio was based on Spoor's and Anderson's appetite for innovation.  Spoor was intrigued by Edison's [[Kinetoscope]] at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition but thought the invention could be improved.  Armed with a vision, Spoor created the Magniscope, which allowed films to be projected onto flat surfaces.&lt;ref name="Scheetz"/&gt;  Spoor and Anderson installed, operated, and rented the Magniscope to many theaters around Chicago.  The Magniscope innovation would eventually create legal battles between Essanay and the Edison Company and end up with the creation of the Motion Picture Patents Company.  Anderson's film prowess came from on-screen achievement.  He acted in the production of ''The Great Train Robbery'',and became one of the first western stars.  His nickname became, "Broncho Billy", for his involvement with western films.&lt;ref name="Scheetz"/&gt;  Due to his love for westerns, Anderson convinced Spoor to establish Essanay branches in Boulder, Colorado and Fremont California.  These locations were perfect, especially the California location, because of the steady climate and mountainous landscape.&lt;ref name="Scheetz"/&gt;

Essanay Studios in Chicago was the capital of Chicago film in the first decades of the 1900s.  [[Charlie Chaplin]] started his career in 1915 at Essanay Studios.  He was hired in 1915 and paid $1,250.00 per week.&lt;ref name ="Verdi"&gt;Verdi, Tony (1996).  When Chicago was Hollywood. Hollywood's Attic. Burbank, California.&lt;/ref&gt;   Chaplin improvised the scripts that were given to him by adding slapstick humor.  Ben Turpin, fellow actor for Essanay, and Chaplin worked together on slapstick projects.  Turpin was cross-eyed which made him a natural sidekick to the antics of Chaplin.&lt;ref name="Verdi"/&gt;  Chaplin's only full feature production at Essanay was called ''[[His New Job]]''.&lt;ref name="Christopher"/&gt;  Another notable actress who found a beginning at Essanay Studio was [[Gloria Swanson]].  Swanson would later star in many television and film productions including the smash hit [[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]].

Despite booming success under Charlie Chaplin, Essanay Studios soon faced a downturn.  Chaplin did not like Chicago due to unpredictable weather conditions.  After only one month of work, Chaplin left Chicago to head west.  Spoor and Anderson soon hired French comedian, [[Max Linder]], to take the role of Chaplin.&lt;ref name="Verdi"/&gt;  Linder's rye humor was not appreciated by the Chicago audiences.  The company suffered economically due to the inability to produce a popular film.  In 1918 George Kleine purchased the studio to form a merger between Vitagraph, Lubin, Selig, and Essanay known as [[Vitagraph Studios#V-L-S-E, Incorporated|V-L-S-E, Incorporated]] which would eventually absorbed by [[Warner Brothers]].&lt;ref name="Scheetz"/&gt;  The Essanay location would eventually be taken over by industrial film producer, Norman Wilding.  Currently, the remnants of the studio are part of [[St. Augustine College (Illinois)|St. Augustine's College]] which built a Charlie Chaplin memorial theater on site.&lt;ref name="Christopher"&gt;Christopher, Rob.

===Motion Picture Patents Company===

The rise of the Chicago film industry in the early 1900s was a product of technological advancement marked by political strategy. In 1889, [[Thomas Edison]] and William Dickson patented the [[Kinetoscope]]. The Kinetoscope allowed a single viewer to watch a film reel through a small window. At this time, Edison did not see any practical value to the Kinetoscope and dismissed the invention as a toy.&lt;ref name="Scheetz"/&gt;  However, aspiring filmmakers began designing and patenting similar projection machines around the Kinetoscope that allowed a film to be shown to a large audience. William Selig and George K. Spoor of Essanay Studios in Chicago, the [[Biograph Company]], and Vitagraph Company all improvised Edison's work.&lt;ref name="Scheetz"/&gt;  Film companies of this time period customarily both created movies and established a means of viewing.

Despite initial ignorance to the Kinetoscope, the [[Edison Manufacturing Company]] responded to this innovation with legal action. According to the company, film outfits were showing motion pictures illegally because each of the improvised projectors violated the Kinetoscope patent. However, each film outfit had its own patent protection connected with individual innovations.&lt;ref name="Scheetz"/&gt;  Concurrent formation of a black market for projection equipment exacerbated legal issues. Following legal proceedings, the Motion Picture Patents Company was established on January 1, 1909.&lt;ref name="Lindstrom"&gt;Lindstrom, J.A. [http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/452.html''Film'']{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }},''[[Encyclopedia of Chicago]]'', Chicago, 2004. Retrieved on 2010-11-07.&lt;/ref&gt;   This coalition established a trust of the major film outfits in the United States. Firms from Chicago included in the Motion Picture Patents Company were the Vitagraph Company, the Selig Polyscope Company, the Kleine Company, and Essanay Studios.&lt;ref name="Dirks"&gt;Dirks, Tim. [http://www.filmsite.org/pre20sintro3.html "Film History Before 1920"], [[AMC Filmsite]], Chicago. Retrieved on 2010-11-07.&lt;/ref&gt;  Provisions restricted movie making to these licensed firms. The trust also required outfits to pay the Edison Company royalties for use of the improvised projection equipment. To snuff out competitors, a rental system was put in place. Individuals operating theaters were now required to pay a $2 per week rental for films and projection equipment.&lt;ref name="Scheetz"/&gt;

===The Chicago independents push back===
Exhibitors and filmmakers who refused to pay the newly instituted fees were not stopped by this new legislation. Independent companies were formed outside of this trust almost immediately. Max Lewis, president of the Chicago Film Exchange, announced he would not comply with the $10 monthly licensing fee on projectors.&lt;ref&gt;"Declare War on Film Trust.: Five Cent Theater Men Organize for Resistance. Chicago Daily Tribune, 16 Jan 1909: 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Within 48 hours of the formation of the MPPC, a Chicago-based combine of independents, the International Projecting and Producing Company (IPPC), formed to counter the MPPC's stranglehold. The IPPC, headed by the John J. Murdoch, general manager of the [[Western Vaudeville Managers' Association]], dramatically announced the firm's formation with a $2 million base in the Feb. 6, 1909, issue of ''Show World'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Moving Picture War is Declared: Independents Organized by J. J. Murdock for Fight on "Film Trust." Chicago Daily Tribune 05 Feb 1909: 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals risked their own livelihood by operating independently.&lt;ref name="Lindstrom"/&gt;  The major companies in the trust could sue any of these firms for violation of patent rights.

[[File:BBA Lantern Slide.jpg|thumb|An Advertisement for a western produced by Essanay founder, Brocho Billy Anderson]]

Chicago became a leader in motion pictures with innovative trailblazers and an interested public. In 1907, Chicago had more theaters per capita than any other city in the United States.&lt;ref name="Lindstrom"/&gt;  Nickelodeons or five-cent theaters became extremely popular with the number of venues growing each year until the Great Depression. These theaters quenched the public's thirst for film and created solid neighborhood relations.

Revolutionary in Chicago's film industry was the establishment of rental houses or film exchanges; in 1907, Chicago had more than 15 film exchange houses, such as The Stereopticon &amp; Film Exchange, William Swanson &amp; Company, Chicago Projecting Company, and the International Projecting and Producing Company, formed by JJ Murdoch as an independent Chicago-based exchange. These rental houses allowed exhibitors to borrow films at a reduced cost than actually purchasing them.&lt;ref name="Dirks"/&gt;  This movement revolutionized motion picture viewership. It allowed patrons access to a wide array of films. The average viewer could now experience a variety of film disciplines for a small consumer cost. Rental houses also enabled theaters to change films frequently, keeping the film consumer interested. Chicago quickly became the leading film distribution market in the entire United States with control of 80% of the market in the early 1900s.&lt;ref name="Lindstrom"/&gt;

Movie production also boomed. Production companies, like the Essanay Studios and the [[Selig Polyscope Company]], dominated the film landscape. These two firms employed hundreds of people and churned out hundreds of films every year. Filmmakers shot their films outdoors due to the need for ample lighting with the primitive camera equipment. Sets took up entire city blocks at a time. The banks of the [[Chicago River]] were often used as a set for the westerns Anderson trademarked.&lt;ref name="Scheetz"/&gt;  Motion pictures were valued differently in the early era of film. Modern films are highly valued with vast amounts of resources being poured into the production value. In the early 1900s, films were viewed as products with a studio releasing multiple films per week.&lt;ref name="Verdi"/&gt;

==Decline of the Chicago film industry==

===1920s===
The Chicago film industry met decline for a combination of reasons. The Motion Picture Patents Company, established to protect the major players in the industry, actually promoted the birth of independent ventures.&lt;ref name="Lindstrom"/&gt;  These ventures sought to circumvent payment to the companies united under the Motion Picture Patents Company trust. Independent firms granted creative license to the actor and often competed with the major firms despite the significantly lower budget. To avoid litigation by the Motion Picture Patents Company for patent violation, many independent firms moved west, literally out of the reach of the major production companies.&lt;ref name="Scheetz"/&gt;

In addition to the avoidance of legal trouble, [[California]] was perfect for film making in other respects as well. Weather was notably milder compared to the unpredictability of Chicago's climate. This enabled production to move at a steady pace with greater consistency.&lt;ref name="Verdi"/&gt;  The scenery of the west also attracted many production companies. California is made up of a diverse landscape of natural settings while Chicago offered a monotone set of plains. Filmmakers followed in the footsteps of G.M. Anderson with the desire to film westerns within the natural mountainous habitat.&lt;ref name="Scheetz"/&gt;

==Revival==

===1920s to present===
Despite the transition from Chicago to Hollywood in the 1920s, Chicago remained on the map. Citizens retained an insatiable appetite for motion pictures, even though production had left the city. Chicago boasted the largest chain of theaters during the studio era (1919–1952).&lt;ref name="Lindstrom"/&gt; The Balaban and Katz chain, once small west-side exhibitors, bloomed their business into a citywide phenomena. [[Balaban and Katz]] owned movie and stage palaces such as the [[Chicago Theatre]], [[Ford Center for the Performing Arts Oriental Theatre]], and [[Balaban and Katz Uptown Theatre]].&lt;ref name="Lindstrom"/&gt; High-profile film companies such as [[MGM]], [[Columbia Pictures]], [[Warner Brothers]], [[Republic]], [[Universal Studios|Universal]], [[RKO]], and [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] all held offices in Chicago.

Movie production again entered Chicago in the 1980 with the state of [[Illinois]] becoming a leader in money spent on film production. Notable films from the 1980s include ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]], [[The Color of Money]], [[Risky Business]], [[The Untouchables (film)|The Untouchables]], [[Planes, Trains and Automobiles]]'', and ''[[When Harry Met Sally]].'' Feature film directors returned to the city including [[Dan Aykroyd]] and the [[Belushi family]] (''[[Blues Brothers]], [[About Last Night...|About Last Night]]'', and ''[[Blues Brothers 2000]]''), [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] (''[[Sixteen Candles]]'' and ''[[The Breakfast Club]]''), and [[Andrew Davis (director)|Andrew Davis]] (''[[The Fugitive (1993 film)|The Fugitive]]'' and ''[[Chain Reaction (1996 film)|Chain Reaction]]'').&lt;ref name="Lindstrom"/&gt;

Chicago further fostered its new production boom with the passage of an Illinois bill in 2009. This bill provides a 30% tax credit on all production costs within the state of Illinois.&lt;ref name="Murphy"&gt;Murphy, Dan. [http://news.medill.northwestern.edu/chicago/news.aspx?id=170338''Illinois Tax Credit put Chicago Film Industry Back on the Map'']{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''[[Medill Reports Chicago]]'', Chicago, 13 October 2010. Retrieved on 2010-11-07.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since instituting this law in 2009, many filmmakers have committed to Chicago for production. Recent films with Chicago as a filming location include ''[[Transformers: Dark of the Moon]]'', ''[[Contagion (film)|Contagion]]'', and ''[[Source Code]]''. The new bill is supposed to benefit Chicago with increased tax revenue from $70 million in 2009 to $100 million in 2010.&lt;ref name="Murphy"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19549">A '''chiral''' phenomenon is one that is not identical to its [[mirror image]] (see the article on [[Chirality (mathematics)|mathematical chirality]]). The [[Spin (physics)|spin]] of a [[Elementary particle|particle]] may be used to define a '''handedness''', or helicity, for that particle, which, in the case of a massless particle, is the same as chirality. A [[symmetry transformation]] between the two is called [[parity (physics)|parity]] transformation. Invariance under parity transformation by a [[Dirac fermion]] is called '''chiral symmetry'''.

[[Wu experiment|An experiment]] on the [[weak nuclear force|weak decay]] of [[cobalt]]-60 nuclei carried out by [[Chien-Shiung Wu]] and collaborators in 1957 demonstrated that [[parity violation|parity is not a symmetry]] of the universe.

==Chirality and helicity==
{{see also|Helicity (particle physics)}}
The helicity of a particle is ''right-handed'' if the direction of its [[spin (physics)|spin]] is the same as the direction of its motion. It is ''left-handed'' if the directions of spin and motion are opposite. So a standard [[clock]], with its spin vector defined by the rotation of its hands, tossed with its face directed forwards, has left-handed helicity.

Mathematically, helicity is the sign of the projection of the [[spin (physics)|spin]] [[vector (geometric)|vector]] onto the [[momentum]] [[vector (geometric)|vector]]: “left” is negative, “right” is positive.

[[Image:Right left helicity.svg|center]]
The ''chirality'' of a particle is more abstract: It is determined by whether the particle transforms in a right- or left-handed [[Group representation|representation]] of the [[Poincaré group]].&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Note, however, that representations such as [[Dirac spinor]]s and others, have both right- and left-handed components. In cases like this, we can define [[projection operator]]s that project out either the right or left hand components and discuss the right- and left-handed portions of the representation.&lt;/ref&gt;

For massless particles – [[photon]]s, [[gluon]]s, and (hypothetical) [[graviton]]s – chirality is the same as [[helicity (particle physics)|helicity]]; a given massless particle appears to spin in the same direction along its axis of motion regardless of point of view of the observer.

For massive particles – such as [[electron]]s, [[quark]]s, and [[neutrino]]s – chirality and helicity must be distinguished: In the case of these particles, it is possible for an observer to change to a [[Frame of reference|reference frame]] moving faster than the spinning particle, in which case the particle will then appear to move backwards, and its helicity (which may be thought of as “apparent chirality”) will be reversed.

A ''massless'' particle moves with the [[speed of light]], so no real observer (who must always travel at less than the [[speed of light]]) can be in any reference frame where the particle appears to reverse its relative direction of spin, meaning that all real observers see the same helicity. Because of this, the direction of spin of massless particles is not affected by a change of viewpoint ([[Lorentz boost]]) in the direction of motion of the particle, and the sign of the projection (helicity) is fixed for all reference frames: The helicity of massless particles is a “''relativistic invariant''” (a quantity whose value is the same in all inertial reference frames) which always matches the massless particles' chirality.

The discovery of [[neutrino oscillation]] implies [[neutrino#Mass|that neutrinos have mass]], so the only observed massless particle is the [[photon]]. The [[gluon]] is also expected to be massless, although the assumption that it is has not been conclusively tested. Hence, these are the only two particles now known for which helicity could be identical to chirality, and only one of them has been confirmed by measurement. All other observed particles have mass and thus may have different helicities in different reference frames. It is still possible that as-yet unobserved particles, like the [[graviton]], might be massless, and hence have invariant helicity that matches their chirality, like the [[photon]].

==Chiral theories==
Only left-handed [[fermion]]s and right-handed antifermions interact with the [[weak force|weak interaction]].&lt;ref&gt;Bogdan Povh, Klaus Rith, Christoph Scholz, Frank Zetsche, ''Particles and Nuclei: An Introduction to the Physical Concepts'', (Springer 2006) p. 145, {{ISBN|978-3-540-36683-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In most circumstances, two left-handed [[fermion]]s interact more strongly than right-handed or opposite-handed [[fermions]], implying that the universe has a preference for left-handed chirality, which violates a symmetry of the other forces of nature.

Chirality for a [[Fermionic field#Dirac fields|Dirac fermion]]  {{mvar|ψ}} is defined through the operator [[Gamma matrices|{{math|''γ''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;}}]], which has [[eigenvalue, eigenvector, and eigenspace|eigenvalue]]s ±1.  
Any Dirac field can thus be projected into its left- or right-handed component by acting with the [[Projection (linear algebra)|projection operators]] {{math|½(1−''γ''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;)}} or {{math|½(1+''γ''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;)}} on {{mvar|ψ}}.

The coupling of the charged weak interaction to fermions is proportional to the first projection operator, which is responsible for this interaction's [[parity (physics)|parity symmetry]] violation.

A common source of confusion is due to conflating this operator with the [[helicity (particle physics)|helicity]] operator. Since the helicity of massive particles is frame-dependent, it might seem that the same particle would interact with the weak force according to one frame of reference, but not another.  The resolution to this false paradox is that ''the chirality operator is equivalent to helicity for massless fields only'', for which helicity is not frame-dependent.  By contrast, for massive particles, ''chirality is not the same as helicity'', so there is no frame dependence of the weak interaction: a particle that couples the weak force in one frame, does so in every frame.

A theory that is asymmetric with respect to chiralities is called a ''chiral theory'', while a non-chiral (i.e., parity-symmetric) theory is sometimes called a ''vector theory''.  Many pieces of the [[Standard Model]] of physics are non-chiral, which is traceable to  [[Anomaly (physics)|anomaly cancellation]] in chiral theories.  [[Quantum chromodynamics]] is an example of a ''vector theory'', since both chiralities of all quarks appear in the theory, and couple to gluons in the same way.

The [[electroweak theory]], developed in the mid 20th century, is an example of a ''chiral theory''. Originally, it assumed that [[neutrino#Mass|neutrinos were massless]], and only assumed the existence of left-handed [[neutrino]]s (along with their complementary right-handed antineutrinos). After the observation of [[neutrino oscillation]]s, which imply that [[neutrino#Mass|neutrinos are massive]] like all other [[fermion]]s, the revised [[electroweak theory|theories of the electroweak interaction]] now include both right- and left-handed [[neutrino]]s.  However, it is still a chiral theory, as it does not respect parity symmetry.

The exact nature of the [[neutrino]] is still unsettled and so the [[electroweak theory|electroweak theories]] that have been proposed are somewhat different, but most accommodate the chirality of [[neutrino]]s in the same way as was already done for all other [[fermions]].

==Chiral symmetry==
Vector [[gauge theory|gauge theories]] with massless Dirac fermion fields  {{mvar|ψ}}  exhibit chiral symmetry, i.e., rotating the left-handed and the right-handed components independently makes no difference to the theory. We can write this as the action of rotation on the fields:
:&lt;math&gt;\psi_L\rightarrow e^{i\theta_L}\psi_L&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\psi_R\rightarrow \psi_R&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;\psi_L\rightarrow \psi_L&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\psi_R\rightarrow e^{i\theta_R}\psi_R.&lt;/math&gt;

With {{mvar|N}} [[Flavor (particle physics)|flavors]], we have unitary rotations instead: {{math|''U(N)&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;times;U(N)&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.

More generally, we write the right-handed and left-handed states as a projection operator acting on a spinor. The right-handed and left-handed projection operators are
:&lt;math&gt; P_R = \frac{1 + \gamma^5}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt; P_L = \frac{1 - \gamma^5}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

Massive fermions do not exhibit chiral symmetry, as the mass term in the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]],    {{math|  ''m''{{overset|&amp;mdash;|''ψ''}}''ψ''}},  breaks chiral symmetry explicitly.

[[Chiral symmetry breaking|Spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking]] may also occur in some theories, as it most notably does in [[quantum chromodynamics]].

The chiral symmetry transformation can be divided into a component that treats the left-handed and the right-handed parts equally, known as '''vector symmetry''', and a component that actually treats them differently, known as '''axial symmetry'''.&lt;ref&gt;Ta-Pei Cheng and Ling-Fong Li, ''Gauge Theory of Elementary Particle Physics'',  (Oxford 1984) {{ISBN|978-0198519614}}&lt;/ref&gt; (cf. [[Current algebra]].) A scalar field model encoding chiral symmetry and its [[chiral symmetry breaking|breaking]] is the [[chiral model]].

The most common application is expressed as equal treatment of clockwise and counter-clockwise rotations from a fixed frame of reference.

The general principle is often referred to by the name '''chiral symmetry'''. The rule is absolutely valid in the [[classical mechanics]] of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]], but results from [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] experiments show a difference in the behavior of left-chiral versus right-chiral [[subatomic particles]].

===Example: ''u'' and ''d'' quarks in QCD===
Consider [[quantum chromodynamics]] (QCD) with two ''massless'' [[quarks]] {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|d}} (massive fermions do not exhibit chiral symmetry). The Lagrangian reads
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} = \overline{u}\,i\displaystyle{\not}D \,u + \overline{d}\,i\displaystyle{\not}D\, d + \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{gluons}~.&lt;/math&gt;

In terms of left-handed and right-handed spinors, it reads
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} = \overline{u}_L\,i\displaystyle{\not}D \,u_L + \overline{u}_R\,i\displaystyle{\not}D \,u_R + \overline{d}_L\,i\displaystyle{\not}D \,d_L  + \overline{d}_R\,i\displaystyle{\not}D \,d_R + \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{gluons} ~.&lt;/math&gt;
(Here, {{mvar|i}} is the imaginary unit and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\not}D&lt;/math&gt; the [[Dirac operator]].)

Defining
:&lt;math&gt;q = \begin{bmatrix} u \\ d \end{bmatrix} ,&lt;/math&gt;
it can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} = \overline{q}_L\,i\displaystyle{\not}D \,q_L + \overline{q}_R\,i\displaystyle{\not}D\, q_R + \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{gluons} ~.&lt;/math&gt;

The Lagrangian is unchanged under a rotation of ''q&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' by any 2×2 unitary matrix  {{mvar|L}}, and ''q&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' by any 2×2 unitary matrix {{mvar|R}}.

This symmetry of the Lagrangian is called ''flavor chiral symmetry'', and denoted as {{math|''U(2)&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;×U(2)&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.   It decomposes into
:&lt;math&gt;SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_V \times U(1)_A ~.&lt;/math&gt;

The singlet vector symmetry, {{math|''U(1)&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;''}},  acts as
:&lt;math&gt;
q_L \rightarrow e^{i\theta} q_L \qquad
q_R \rightarrow e^{i\theta} q_R ~,
&lt;/math&gt;
and corresponds to [[baryon number]] conservation.

The singlet axial group  {{math|''U(1)&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''}}  acts as
:&lt;math&gt;
q_L \rightarrow e^{i\theta} q_L \qquad
q_R \rightarrow e^{-i\theta} q_R ~,
&lt;/math&gt;
and it does not correspond to a conserved quantity, because it is explicitly violated by a [[anomaly (physics)|quantum anomaly]].

The remaining chiral symmetry {{math|''SU(2)&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;×SU(2)&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;''}} turns out to be [[spontaneous symmetry breaking|spontaneously broken]] by a [[quark condensate]] 
&lt;math&gt;\textstyle \langle \bar{q}^a_R q^b_L \rangle = v \delta^{ab}&lt;/math&gt; formed through nonperturbative action of QCD gluons, 
into the diagonal vector subgroup ''SU(2)&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;'' known as [[isospin]]. The [[Goldstone bosons]] corresponding to the three broken generators are the three [[pions]]. 
As a consequence, the effective theory of QCD bound states like the baryons, must now include mass terms for them, ostensibly disallowed by unbroken chiral symmetry. Thus, this [[chiral symmetry breaking]] induces the bulk of hadron masses, such as those for the [[nucleon]]s &amp;mdash; in effect, the bulk of the mass of all visible matter.

In the real world, because of the nonvanishing and differing masses of the quarks,  ''SU(2)&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;×SU(2)&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' is only an approximate symmetry&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gell-Mann | first1 = M. | last2 = Renner | first2 = B. | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.175.2195 | title = Behavior of Current Divergences under SU_{3}×SU_{3} | journal = Physical Review | volume = 175 | issue = 5 | pages = 2195 | year = 1968 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1968PhRv..175.2195G }}&lt;/ref&gt; to begin with, and therefore the pions are not massless, but have small masses: they are [[Chiral symmetry breaking|pseudo-Goldstone boson]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Peskin |first1=Michael |last2=Schroeder |first2=Daniel | title = An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory | publisher = Westview Press | year = 1995 | pages = 670 | isbn = 0-201-50397-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===More Flavors===
For more  "light" quark species, {{mvar|N}}  [[Flavour (particle physics)|flavors]]  in general, the corresponding chiral symmetries are ''U(N)&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;×U(N)&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'',  decomposing into
:&lt;math&gt;SU(N)_L \times SU(N)_R \times U(1)_V \times U(1)_A ~,&lt;/math&gt;
and exhibiting a very analogous [[chiral symmetry breaking]] pattern.

Most usually, {{mvar|N}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3 is taken, the ''u, d'', and ''s'' quarks taken to be light (the [[Eightfold way (physics)]]), so then approximately massless for the symmetry to be meaningful to a lowest order, while the other three quarks are sufficiently heavy to barely have a residual chiral symmetry be visible for practical purposes.

===An application in Particle Physics===
In [[theoretical physics]], the [[electroweak]] model breaks [[parity (physics)|parity]] maximally. All its [[fermion]]s are chiral [[Weyl fermion]]s, which means that the charged [[W and Z bosons|weak gauge bosons]] only couple to left-handed quarks and leptons. (Note that the neutral electroweak Z boson couples to left ''and'' right-handed fermions.)

Some theorists found this objectionable, and so conjectured a [[Grand unification theory|GUT]] extension of the [[weak force]] which has new, high energy [[W' and Z' bosons]], which now couple with right handed quarks and leptons:
:&lt;math&gt;{[SU(2)_W\times U(1)_Y]\over \mathbb{Z}_2}&lt;/math&gt;
to
:&lt;math&gt;{SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R\times U(1)_{B-L}\over \mathbb{Z}_2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here, SU(2)&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; (pronounced SU(2) left) is none other than the above SU(2)&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt;, while  [[B−L]] is the [[baryon number]] minus the [[lepton number]]. The electric charge formula in this model is given by
:&lt;math&gt; Q= I_{3L}+I_{3R}+\frac{B-L}{2}&lt;/math&gt;;
where &lt;math&gt;\! I_{3L,R}&lt;/math&gt; are the [[weak isospin]] values of the fields in the theory.

There is also the [[chromodynamic]] SU(3)&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;. The idea was to restore parity by introducing a '''left-right symmetry'''. This is a [[group extension]] of '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (the left-right symmetry) by
:&lt;math&gt;{SU(3)_C\times SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{B-L}\over \mathbb{Z}_6}&lt;/math&gt;
to the [[semidirect product]]
:&lt;math&gt;{SU(3)_C\times SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{B-L}\over \mathbb{Z}_6} \rtimes \mathbb{Z}_2.&lt;/math&gt;

This has two [[connected space|connected component]]s where '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; acts as an [[automorphism]], which is the composition of an [[Involution (mathematics)|involutive]] [[outer automorphism]] of SU(3)&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; with the interchange of the left and right copies of SU(2) with the reversal of U(1)&lt;sub&gt;B−L&lt;/sub&gt;. It was shown by Rabindra N. Mohapatra and [[Goran Senjanovic]] in 1975 that [[left-right symmetry]] can be [[spontaneous symmetry breaking|spontaneously broken]] to give a chiral low energy theory, which is the Standard Model of Glashow, Weinberg and Salam and it also connects the small observed neutrino masses to the breaking of left-right symmetry via the [[seesaw mechanism]].

In this setting, the chiral [[quark]]s
:&lt;math&gt;(3,2,1)_{1\over 3}&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;(\bar{3},1,2)_{-{1\over 3}}&lt;/math&gt;
are unified into an [[irreducible representation]] (“irrep”)
:&lt;math&gt;(3,2,1)_{1\over 3}\oplus(\bar{3},1,2)_{-{1\over 3}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[lepton]]s are also unified into an [[irreducible representation]]
:&lt;math&gt;(1,2,1)_{-1}\oplus(1,1,2)_1.&lt;/math&gt;

The Higgs bosons needed to implement the breaking of left-right symmetry down to the Standard Model
are
:&lt;math&gt;(1,3,1)_{2}\oplus(1,1,3)_{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

This then predicts three [[sterile neutrino]]s, which is perfectly consistent with {{As of|2005|alt=current}} [[neutrino oscillation]] data. Within the seesaw mechanism, the sterile neutrinos become superheavy without affecting physics at low energies.

Because the left-right symmetry is spontaneously broken, left-right models predict [[Domain wall (string theory)|domain wall]]s.
This left-right symmetry idea first appeared in the [[Pati–Salam model]] (1974), Mohapatra–Pati models (1975).

The '''''Distichs of Cato''''' ([[Latin]]: ''Catonis Disticha'', most famously known simply as '''Cato'''), is a [[Latin]] collection of proverbial wisdom and morality by an unknown author named '''Dionysius Cato''' from the 3rd or 4th century AD. The ''Cato'' was the most popular medieval schoolbook for teaching Latin, prized not only as a Latin textbook, but as a moral compass. Cato was in common use as a Latin teaching aid as late as the 18th century, used by [[Benjamin Franklin]].  It was one of the best-known books in the [[Middle Ages]] and was translated into many languages.

==Background==
Cato was the most popular Latin textbook during the Middle Ages, prized not only as a Latin textbook, but as a moral compass for impressionable students. It was translated into many languages, including [[Old Norse language|Norse]].  

{{rquote|right|''He knew nat Catoun, for his wit was rude.''|''[[Canterbury Tales]]''}}

[[Geoffrey Chaucer]] referred to Cato in ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'', through which modern students, less versed in Latin, often first come upon it. 

The ''Distichs of Cato'' was most commonly referred to as simply "Cato". In the [[Middle Ages]] it was assumed the work had been written by [[Cato the Elder]], or even [[Cato the Younger]]. Cato the Elder was assumed to have included tracts of the prose in his ''Carmen de Moribus'', but this was found to be a later addition. It was eventually attributed to the anonymous author Dionysius Cato (also known as Catunculus) from the 3rd or 4th century AD, based upon evidence in a manuscript discussed by [[Julius Caesar Scaliger]] (1484–1558). This manuscript no longer exists, though Scaliger found it authoritative.

The Roman jurist [[Marcus Porcius Cato Licinianus|Licinianus]], son of Cato the Younger, wrote ''Liber Catonianus'', describing Cato as an honest man who opposed [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]'s excesses. It has been argued that Licinianus might be the original author of the ''Distichs of Cato''.&lt;ref&gt;Marin, P. "Cato the Younger: Myth and Reality", Ph.D (unpublished), UCD, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1513 [[Erasmus]] corrected and commented on the text in a new edition of his own. 

[[Corderius]] made the French translation, enriching it with commentaries on classical authors.  His work was aimed at children with a summary, verses and an analysis of the structure. It was actually a grammatical treatise.

There were several Spanish translations of the work of Corderius. From the first one in 1490 down to 1964, there are records of 6 Spanish translations. An authority on [[Michael Servetus]], González Echeverría&lt;ref&gt;2011  “The love for truth. Life and work of Michael Servetus”, (El amor a la verdad. Vida y obra de Miguel Servet.), printed by Navarro y Navarro, Zaragoza, collaboration with the Government of Navarre, Department of Institutional Relations and Education of the Government of Navarra, 607 pp, 64 illustrations.&lt;/ref&gt; presented at the [[International Society for the History of Medicine|ISHM]]&lt;ref&gt;2011 September 9th, Francisco González Echeverría VI International Meeting for the History of Medicine, Barcelona.New Discoveries on the biography of Michael De Villeneuve (Michael Servetus) &amp; New discoverys on the work of Michael De Villeneuve (Michael Servetus)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;2000  “ Find of new editions of Bibles and of two ' lost ' grammatical works of Michael Servetus” and “ The doctor Michael Servetus was descendant of jews”, González Echeverría , Francisco Javier. Abstracts, 37th International Congress on the History of Medicine, September 10–15, 2000, Galveston, Texas, U.S.A., pp. 22-23.&lt;/ref&gt; the thesis that Servetus was actually the author of the anonymous Spanish translation of 1543 of this work of Corderius.

There were several English translations, one being that of [[John Kingston]] in 1584.

[[Benjamin Franklin]] probably studied Cato when he was at [[Boston Latin School]]. He cites Cato in ''[[Poor Richard's Almanac]]'' and believed in the moral advice with such fervor he was troubled to print [[James Logan (statesman)|James Logan]]'s translation called ''Cato's Moral Distichs Englished in Couplets'' in 1735, the first in the [[Thirteen Colonies|Colonies]]. Of its limited need in the morally [[puritan]] [[New England]] colonies, Franklin says:

::"It would be thought a Piece of Hypocrisy and pharisaical Ostentation in me, if I should say, that I print these Distichs more with a view to the Good of others than my own private Advantage: And indeed I cannot say it; for I confess, I have so great Confidence in the common Virtue and Good Sense of the People of this and the neighoring Provinces, that I expect to sell a very good impression."

==Cato==
{{cquote|'''''Libros lege''' (Read books)''&lt;br&gt;&amp;mdash;Cato, Monostichs.}}

"[[Distich]]" means closed couplets, a style of writing with two-liners. It is a collection of moral advice, each consisting of hexameters, in four books. Cato is not particularly Christian in character, but it is monotheistic.

===Sample distichs===
2.1. If you can, even remember to help people you don't know.&lt;br&gt;
More precious than a kingdom it is to gain friends by kindness. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
2.9. Do not disdain the powers of a small body;&lt;br&gt;
He may be strong in counsel (though) nature denies him strength.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
3.2. If you live rightly, do not worry about the words of bad people,&lt;br&gt;
It is not our call as to what each person says.

'''Dzigar Kongtrul Rinpoche''' (b. 23 Oct 1964&lt;ref&gt;Farber, Don and Novick, Rebecca McClen (2005) ''Portraits of Tibetan Buddhist Masters'' {{ISBN|0-520-23973-3}} p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khandro.net/practice_calendar.htm Khandro Rinpoche's practice calendar]&lt;/ref&gt;) is the title of a [[tulku]] lineage of [[Tibetan Buddhist]] [[lama]]s. They originate with [[Jamgon Kongtrul Lodro Thaye]], one of the most illustrious lamas of recent history, known for his central role in the [[rimé]] or non-sectarian movement in 19th Century Tibet. Jigme Namgyel (b. 1964) is the present Dzigar Kongtrul Rinpoche. He is the second or third incarnation, depending on whether Lodro Thaye is counted (he was not known as "Dzigar Kongtrul"—that lineage is one of five distinct subsequent variants beginning after his death).

==The 2nd Dzigar Kongtrul==
The second Dzigar Kongtrul, Lodrö Rabpel, was recognized by his root guru the 15th Karmapa, [[Khakyab Dorje]], along with Karsey Kongtrul. He was the younger brother of Dzigar Chogtrül, a Drukpa Kagyü of a long incarnate lineage.

His bases of activity were [[Palpung Monastery]], [[Tsanda Rinchen Drag]] and [[Dzong Shö]], and later he founded a monastery known as [[Rango Tsokha]] near Neten Gön, the monastery of the 2nd Neten Chokling Rinpoche to whom he was very close. According to [[Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche]], a contemporary master who died in 1996, Lodro Rabpel was renowned throughout [[Derge]] for his eloquence.&lt;ref&gt;''Blazing Splendor: The Memoirs of the Dzogchen Yogi Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche'', pg 215, 252&lt;/ref&gt;

==The 3rd Dzigar Kongtrul==

The present Dzigar Kongtrul was born in the Northern [[India]]n province of [[Himachal Pradesh]] to [[Tibet]]an refugee parents; his father was the third [[Neten Chokling Rinpoche]] and his mother, [[Mayum Tsewang Palden]], practiced all her life, even in the midst of raising five children. Rinpoche grew up in a monastic environment. He was trained in the [[Longchen Nyingtik]] lineage of the [[Nyingma]] school as well as the Khyen-Kong Chok-Sum lineages (those of Jamgon Kongtrul, Khyentse Wangpo and Chokgyur Lingpa—the three primary figures in the rimé movement) by his root guru H.H. [[Dilgo Khyentse]] Rinpoche. Rinpoche also studied extensively under [[Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche]], [[Nyoshul Khen Rinpoche]] and the great scholar Khenpo Rinchen. He moved to the United States in 1989 with his family and began a five-year tenure as a professor of Buddhist philosophy at [[Naropa University]] (then Institute) in 1990.

Not long after arriving in the [[United States]], Rinpoche founded [[Mangala Shri Bhuti]], an organization established to further the practice of the Longchen Nyingtik and Khyen-Kong Chok-sum lineages.  He established a mountain retreat center, Longchen Jigme Samten Ling, in southern [[Colorado]], where he spends much of his time in retreat and guides students in long-term retreat practice. When not in retreat, Rinpoche travels widely throughout the world teaching and furthering his own education.

His most well-known student in the Western world is [[Pema Chödrön]], who took him as her primary teacher in 1994, years after the death of her root guru, [[Chögyam Trungpa]] Rinpoche.&lt;ref name=lion&gt;{{cite web| title = Becoming Pema|author=Andrea Miller|work=Lion's Roar | url = http://www.lionsroar.com/becoming-pema/# |date=20 October 2014| accessdate = 2014-10-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mangala Shri Bhuti]], Rinpoche's organization, has a total of five centers.  Three are study and practice centers -- [[Phuntsok Choling]] in [[Boulder, Colorado]], [[Pema Osel Do Ngak Choling]] in [[Vershire, Vermont]], and the [[Guna Institute]] in [[Bir, Himachal Pradesh|Bir, India]].  The remaining two are retreat centers -- [[Longchen Jigme Samten Ling]] in [[Crestone, Colorado]], and [http://www.gunanorling.org/ Guna Norling] in [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador, Bahia - Brazil]].

===Artistic pursuits===
Dzigar Kongtrul Rinpoche is also an abstract expressionist painter. Kongtrul Rinpoche views creativity as "something very large - the essence of everything". His training in the arts began at an early age with the practice of calligraphy, music, ritual dance and other traditional Tibetan arts. After his introduction to Western culture, Rinpoche became increasingly interested in modern art, particularly abstract painting and the work of [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Wassily Kandinsky]]. He began painting under the guidance of his teacher, Yahne Le Toumelin in the mid-1990s. Mrs. Le Toumelin, who is based in Dordogne, France, is herself a renowned abstract expressionist painter who was introduced by André Breton in the 1960 as one of the few women painters to make a mark in her generation. Mrs. Le Toumelin teaches a unique style of oil paint mixed with glue applied with special palettes. She regards Rinpoche as her most significant student and an artist whose fearlessness and brilliance are incomparable{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}.

===Integrating art and wisdom===
In his book ''Natural Vitality'', Dzigar Kongtrul Rinpoche speaks about how the creative process and meditation can merge. The outcome is not only profound works of art, but an added dimension for our spiritual growth.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The essential practice of meditation is to allow the mind to express itself freely without fear or judgment. In each moment of awareness we encounter impressions of the outer world through our sense perception as well as our inner world of thoughts, feelings and emotions. When, through the process of meditation, we are able to let this incredible array of experience be, without trying to reject what we fear or pull in what we feel attracted to - when we relax into experience without trying to manipulate it in any way - we have a complete experience of mind, naked and unaltered.  Art, when it is free of such notions of beauty and ugliness, ‘shoulds’ and ‘shouldn’ts’ can be used to express this complete experience of mind. When art evolves from this understanding it provides the possibility for those who see it to also experience the natural and unfabricated nature of their own awareness. –Dzigar Kongtrul Rinpoche
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Emfietzoglou Gallery Museum''' is an [[art gallery]] in [[Athens]], [[Greece]]. It is sited in [[Marousi]] near the metro station. Its founder [[Prodromos Emfietzoglou]] gave his private art collection of over 500 works to the public. 

These days the Emphietsoglou gallery offers a review of 750 works of modern Greek art including some of the best paintings from the last 200 years. 

__TOC__

==History==
Since 19th century Prodromos Emfietzoglou and his family due to their interest in Greek art were collecting works of various Greek painters. Their passion in combination with many artists' donations led in 1999 to the foundation of the museum. Today the collection is composed of paintings, sculpture, photography, engravings and video installations.

==The Gallery==
The museum is cited in Maroussi in 3.000 m&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt; next to the collector's residence. 
Today there are about 750 works of 260 Greek artists. The works are distributed in the museum's building, in the surrounding open area and some are exposed in the collector's residence but in spite of this spatial division visitors are allowed to visit all the works.
The last years several educational happenings are arranged. It is calculated that about 20.000 students took part in these happenings.

'''Fiske &amp; Meginnis, Architects''' was an [[architecture]] firm partnership from 1915-1924 between Ferdinand C. Fiske and Harry Meginnis in [[Lincoln, Nebraska]]. Twelve of the buildings they designed are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] (NRHP) list. They have additional buildings on the list with other partnerships or individually credited.

Ferdinand C. Fiske was born in New York and raised in [[Iowa]]. He was educated at [[Cornell University]] and moved to Lincoln during the building boom of 1887 and practiced there the rest of his life. He was a founding partner of firms including Fiske &amp; Dieman (1898-1912);&lt;ref&gt;[[University of Nebraska-Lincoln]]. “[http://historicbuildings.unl.edu/people.php?peopleID=23&amp;cid=14 Fiske &amp; Dieman].” Historic Buildings. UNL Libraries, 2005. Accessed September 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Fiske &amp; Miller (1912-1924); and Fiske, Meginnis, &amp; Schaumberg (1924-1925).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Zimmer, Ed. “[http://www.lincolntoday.co/?p=311 The Buildings of F. C. Fiske: An Architectural Tour of Lincoln].” Lincoln Today. Lincoln Today Magazine, December 31, 2014. Accessed October 7, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Harry Meginnis did not receive an education in architecture but learned through the construction business.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;University of Nebraska-Lincoln. “[http://historicbuildings.unl.edu/people.php?peopleID=32&amp;cid=16 Meginnis &amp; Schaumberg].” Historic Buildings. UNL Libraries, 2005. Accessed September 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; He worked under Fiske at Fiske &amp; Dieman (1901-1909) in their Lincoln office as a [[draftsman]]. He had brief stints at several firms in [[Indianapolis]] including DuPont &amp; Hunter (1907-1909); H.L. Bass Co. (1909-1914); and Broakie &amp; Meginnis (1914-1915). In 1915, Meginnis returned to Lincoln to start Fiske &amp; Meginnis (1915-1924) and Fiske, Meginnis, &amp; Schaumberg (1924-1925). Meginnis went on to establish [[Meginnis &amp; Schaumberg]] (1925-1943)&lt;ref&gt;Minder, Fred, J. “[http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ne/topic/resources/OLLibrary/who1940/co/Lancaster/lancstrl.htm Who’s Who in Nebraska].” NEGenWeb Project Resource Center. Nebraska Press Association, 1940. Accessed October 8, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; with Edward G. Schaumberg. It lasted until Meginnis died in 1943.

While Fiske and his partners worked under many different styles, Fiske &amp; Meginnis mostly worked within the English [[Revivalism (architecture)|Revival]] realm (Elizabethan, Georgian, and Tudor among others) combined with the [[Prairie School|Prairie style]] that [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] was concerned with at the time. They were also involved in a significant number of industrial warehouse projects in Lincoln, namely in the [[Haymarket District (Lincoln, Nebraska)|Haymarket District]].

== Selected works ==

===Reese House===
[[File:ReeseHouse.jpeg|thumb|Reese House designed by Fiske and Meginnis in 1907|upright=1.3]]
Located within the Mount Emerald and Capitol Additions District, the [[Reese House]] was designed by Fiske and Meginnis in 1907.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Chatfield, Penelope &amp; Kidd, Daniel. “[http://www.nebraskahistory.org/histpres/nebraska/lancaster/LC13-Mt-Emerald-HD.pdf National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form - Mount Emerald &amp; Capitol Additions Historic Residential District].” Nebraska State Historical Society. National Park Service, May 6, 1980. Accessed September 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Reese House]] was designed with false-timber work and stucco and large overhanging eaves over the porches placing it into the Tudor-Revival/Prairie-Style category that Fiske &amp; Meginnis were known for especially in their residential projects. This residence was designed for Manoah Bostic Reese and his family who was the chief justice of the Nebraska Supreme Court and also the Dean for the College of Law at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.

===Lincoln Municipal Lighting and Waterworks Building===
[[File:Lincoln_Municipal_Lighting_and_Waterworks_Building.jpeg|thumb|Lincoln Municipal Lighting and Waterworks Plant in 1921|upright=1.3]]
Though it currently stands as an apartment building, Fiske and Meginnis’ A Street landmark was originally built as the Lincoln Municipal Lighting and Waterworks Plant.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Zimmer, Edward F. “{{NRHP url|id=86001938|title=National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form - Municipal Lighting and Waterworks Plant}}.” Nebraska State Historical Society. National Park Service, June 26, 1986. Accessed October 2, 2015. &lt;/ref&gt; Much like many of their other public works together, Fiske and Meginnis designed a building easily classified as neoclassical revival. Three, large, and light blue smoke stacks protrude through the flat roof, while the large structure and exterior facade of the building consists of a slightly darker red brick, trimmed with [[limestone]] and buff bricks on the [[cornices]]. The focal east and north facades are punctured with what appears to be two stories of large glass windows with round heads. But behind this deceptive façade lies a factory-like interior, renovated into apartments. The large first floor and first floor windows leave room for an attic floor above.

===Antelope Grocery===
[[File:AntelopeGrocery.JPG|thumb|Antelope Grocery designed by Fiske and Meginnis in 1922|upright=1.3]]
Built in 1922, Antelope grocery was constructed as a mixed use (commercial and apartment) building.&lt;ref name="Antelope Grocery"&gt;Zimmer, Edward F. “[http://www.nebraskahistory.org/histpres/nebraska/lancaster/LC13-D08-364-Antelope-Groc.pdf National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form - Antelope Grocery].” Nebraska State Historical Society. [[National Park Service]], December 24, 1987. Accessed October 4, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The two-story brick and stucco structure makes use of architectural elements common to period houses. The store includes a visual usage of Tudor revival-styled elements within the construction and has undergone multiple renovations while retaining a high degree of architectural integrity. This includes the current existence of its original metal framed store-front windows. The lower level of the building remains business, while the upper level is mainly residential apartments. As far as the exterior is concerned, stucco and half-timber form the cladding which traces up to a truncated steeply pitched roof capped with a flat decking. The main modifications to the building's exterior include re roofing and addition of protective glazing over the transoms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10306">The '''Frederic W. Goudy Award''' &amp; Lecture were established in 1969 by funds donated to [[Rochester Institute of Technology]] (RIT) by the [[Mary Flagler Cary]] Charitable Trust in memory of Mrs. Cary's late husband, [[Melbert Cary|Melbert B. Cary, Jr.]], a [[typographer]], type importer, fine printer, book collector, and president of [[AIGA]] (American Institute of Graphic Arts).&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.rit.edu/cary/exhibitions/rit-frederic-w-goudy-award The RIT Frederic W. Goudy Award: 27 Years of Excellence in Typography]&lt;/ref&gt; The award was named after illustrious American type designer [[Frederic W. Goudy]], a friend and business associate of Mr. Cary.

In the Preface to the book ''Twenty Years of the Frederic W. Goudy Award'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://ritpress.rit.edu/publications/books/twenty-years-frederic-w-goudy-award.html Twenty Years of the Frederic W. Goudy Award]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://albert.rit.edu/record=b1237423 Twenty Years of the Frederic W. Goudy Award]&lt;/ref&gt; (Press of the Good Mountain, RIT 1988), Alexander Lawson, RIT Cary Professor emeritus and 1979 recipient of the Goudy Award, wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Cary Trustees also funded an annual Frederic W. Goudy Award to be given to an outstanding practitioner in the field of typography. The person would deliver a Goudy Lecture and meet with students in class and in groups, thus providing an opportunity for informal contact with a distinguished graphic arts figure." &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the "Foreword" to the same book, Mark Guldin, then Cary Professor, former chair of the School of Printing and former Dean of the RIT College of Imaging Arts and Sciences, wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Down through the years, we have always tried to choose those designers and typophiles for the Award who have that thread of attachment to Frederic W. Goudy, those who have worked with the design of [[typeface]]s and those who have produced designs cradled in the traditional values of [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]], [[Nicolas Jenson|Jenson]], [[Aldus Manutius|Aldus]], [[John Baskerville|Baskerville]], and [[Giambattista Bodoni|Bodoni]]. Goudy cherished those traditional values." &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Goudy Award and Lecture was given annually from 1969 to 1995. It was discontinued in 1996 when the institute diverted the funding to other purposes. It was revived in 2012, discontinued again, and revived again in 2015. Printing and typography RIT alumni and friends of the Cary Collection hope it shall continue annually.

==Recipients of the Goudy Award==
In the first years of the Goudy Award, some of the honorees had known Fred Goudy personally, thereby establishing a direct link with the eponymous past. Although that generation of typographers has passed on, along with much of the analog typographic technology and industry that Goudy and Cary were familiar with, many of Goudy's typefaces, long admired and cherished by typographic aficionados, live on and remain popular in digital formats, while new typeface designs by several Goudy Award honorees have become widely popular in digital form.

Goudy Award honorees have generally been outstanding practitioners in the field of typography, including some or all of the following professions:

* Professional typographer and/or typographic designer
* Typeface designer or lettering artist
* Creator of designs and printing in the tradition Goudy cherished
* Personal and/or cultural connection to Goudy
* Educator, historian, scholar, and/or author in the fields of typography, printing, or lettering

The work of the Goudy Award honorees reveals another, implicit criterion: they elevated the artistic, scholarly, and ethical level of typography, whether through type design, like [[Hermann Zapf]], [[Gudrun Zapf-von Hesse|Gudrun Zapf-Von Hesse]], [[Adrian Frutiger]], [[Matthew Carter]], and [[Kris Holmes]]; through the art of fine printing, like [[Will Carter (printer)|Will Carter]], Henry Morris, and [[Giovanni Mardersteig]]; through artistic typography and printing in commercial publishing and graphic design, like Roderick Stinehour, [[Bradbury Thompson]], and [[Robert Bringhurst]]; through engagement in the social issues and responsibilities of typography, like [[Edna Beilenson]] and Robert (Doc) Leslie, and through typographic education and scholarship, like Alexander Lawson, [[John Dreyfus]], [[Warren Chappell]], and [[Charles Bigelow (type designer)|Charles Bigelow]].

Goudy Award honorees have been among the most honored and admired figures in the typographic arts. Two have received [[MacArthur Prize Fellowship|MacArthur Prize Fellowships]] (Bigelow, Carter). Four have received the [[AIGA medal|AIGA Medal]] (Mardersteig, Leslie, Thompson, Carter).  Four have received the Mainz Gutenberg Award (Mardersteig, Zapf, Frutiger, Dreyfus). Nine have received the Type Directors Club Medal (Zapf, Middleton, Leslie, Thompson, Frutiger, Craw, Benguiat, Carter, Lange). Others have received numerous honors and awards in England, Europe, and America.

The '''Global Award for Sustainable Architecture''' was founded in 2006 by architect and professor [[Jana Revedin]]. The Global Award Community, which consists of the 55 contemporary architects from around the globe who have received the award, works towards a sustainable architectural ethic and fosters research, experimentation and transmission in the fields of sustainable architecture, urban renewal and academic social responsibility. It defines architecture as an agent of empowerment, self-development and civic rights.

Each year the award honours five architects who share a belief in more sustainable development and who have pioneered innovative and holistic approaches in their own communities, in western and emerging countries, in developed cities and precarious districts, in megalopolises and in the countryside. The Award is partnered with [[Museum of Finnish Architecture]], International Architecture Biennale of Ljubljana and the Università luav di Venizia. The Award for Sustainable Architecture is run by the [[Cité de l'Architecture et du Patrimoine]] and is supported by BOUYGUES Batiment International and [[BNP Paribas Real Estate]]. Since 2011, the Award for Sustainable Architecture is under the Patronage of [[UNESCO]].

The laureats of the Global Award for Sustainable Architecture are selected by a scientific committee. The 2017 committee included Jana Revedin, Marie-Hélène Contal, Benno Albrecht, Kristiina Nivari, Spela Hudnik and honorary members, Patrice Doat and Anne Feenstra.

{{Apartheid}}
'''Hector Pieterson''' (19 August 1963 – 16 June 1976) was a [[South Africa]]n schoolboy who was shot and killed during the [[Soweto uprising]], when police opened fire on students protesting the enforcement of teaching in [[Afrikaans]]. A news photograph by [[Sam Nzima]] of the mortally wounded Pieterson being carried by another Soweto resident while his sister ran next to them was published around the world. The anniversary of his death is designated [[Youth Day#South Africa|Youth Day]], when South Africans honour young people and bring attention to their needs.

==Soweto Uprising==
{{main article|Soweto Uprising}}
[[File:Hector Pieterson shooting site, cnr Vilakazi &amp; Moema Streets, Soweto.jpg|thumb|300px|The site where Hector Pieterson is reputed to have been shot by Police. It now has a memorial to his memory.]]

On 16 June 1976, school children protested the implementation of [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] and English as dual medium of instruction in secondary schools in a 50:50 basis. This was implemented throughout South Africa regardless of the locally-spoken language and some exams were also written in Afrikaans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://africanhistory.about.com/library/bl/blsaJune16decree.htm|title=The Afrikaans Medium Decree that Led to the Soweto Uprising|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students gathered to peacefully demonstrate, but the crowd soon became intimidated when the police arrived, they then started to throw stones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

A group of 30 students gathered outside the Phefeni Junior Secondary School singing the traditional Sotho anthem 'Morena Boloka Sechaba Sa Heso'. The police arrived  and  fired [[tear gas]] into the crowd in order to disperse them.  
There are conflicting accounts of who gave the first command to shoot, but soon children were turning and running in all directions, leaving some children lying wounded on the road.

Although the media often named Hector as the first child to die that fateful day, another boy, [[Hastings Ndlovu]], was actually the first child to be shot.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} But in the case of Hastings, there were no photographers on the scene, and his name was not immediately known.

When Hector was shot, he fell on the corner of Moema and Vilakazi Streets, he was picked up by [[Mbuyisa Makhubo]] who together with Hector's sister, Antoinette (then 17 years old), ran towards Sam Nzima's car. They bundled him in, and the journalist Sophie Tema&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Hector Pieterson's Grave, Avalon Cemetery, Soweto.jpg|thumb|200px|The grave of Hector Pieterson at Avalon Cemetery, Soweto]]
Since June 1976, Hector's surname has been spelled ''Peterson'' and ''Pietersen'' by the press but the family insists that the correct spelling is ''Pieterson.''  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sowetotour.co.za/soweto-tour.html|title=Soweto Tours {{!}} Widest Selection of Johannesburg City and Day Tours|website=MoAfrika Tours|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227065519/http://www.sowetotour.co.za/soweto-tour.html|archive-date=2014-02-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversial lawsuit==
On 9 August 2002 U.S. lawyer [[Ed Fagan]] led a $50bn{{clarify|usd?|date=May 2018}} class action suit by apartheid-era victims against international firms and banks who profited from dealings with the Apartheid regime. Among the plaintiffs in the lawsuit was Dorothy Molefi, Hector's mother. The South African government as well as [[Nelson Mandela]], [[Thabo Mbeki]] and [[Desmond Tutu]] distanced themselves from the lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Memorial and museum==
On 16 June 2002 the [[Hector Pieterson Museum|Hector Pieterson Memorial and Museum]] was opened near the place he was shot in Orlando West, Soweto to honour Hector and those who died around the country in the 1976 uprising. Funded by the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism (R16 million) and the Johannesburg City Council (R7,2 million), it has become a major tourist attraction. The start of the museum begins with pictures of Hector Pierterson's death. The museum fuses memorabilia with modern technology and cultural history. As of 2010, Hector's sister Antoinette, who is seen in the famous photograph, works at the museum as a tour guide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2485">The "'''Esfahani'''" or "'''Isfahani style'''" (شیوه معماری اصفهانی) is a style (''sabk'') of architecture when categorizing [[Iranian architecture]] development in history. Landmarks of this style span through the [[Safavid]], [[Afsharid]], [[Zand dynasty|Zand]], and [[Qajar]] dynasties starting from the 16th century to the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Fallāḥʹfar, Saʻīd (سعید فلاح‌فر). ''The Dictionary of Iranian Traditional Architectural Terms (Farhang-i vāzhahʹhā-yi miʻmārī-i sunnatī-i Īrān فرهنگ واژه‌های معماری سنتی ایران)''. Kamyab Publications (انتشارات کامیاب). Kāvushʹpardāz. 2000, 2010. Tehran. {{ISBN|978-964-2665-60-0}} US Library of Congress LCCN Permalink: http://lccn.loc.gov/2010342544{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} pp.26&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Isfahani style is the last style of traditional Persian—Iranian architecture.&lt;ref&gt;''Sabk Shenasi Mi'mari Irani'' (Study of styles in Iranian architecture), M. Karim Pirnia. 2005. {{ISBN|964-96113-2-0}} pp.272&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Safavid dynasty]] were chiefly instrumental in the emergence of this style of architecture, which soon spread to India in what became known as [[Mughal architecture]].
 
==Examples==
Examples of the Isfahani style include:
*[[Chehelsotoon]]
*[[Ālī Qāpū|Ali Qapu]]
*[[Agha Bozorg Mosque, Kashan]]
*[[Shah Mosque]]
*[[Sheikh Lotf Allah Mosque]].

The '''''Kneeling Bull With Vessel''''' is a small 6 3/8 inches (16.3&amp;nbsp;cm) tall statue made of silver with an animal upper part of a bull holding a vessel with pebbles inside and a lower part shaped in the body of a kneeling human wearing a patterned article of clothing. The artist is unknown and it is also not known if it has any spiritual connotations. Art such as this show vigorously developing cultural environments, including the building of cities and development of writing, around the Southern [[Mesopotamia]] region in South West [[Iran]] and border regions of [[Iraq]] around the [[4th millennium BC]]. The statue is on display at The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/329074 The Metropolitan Museum of Art]&lt;/ref&gt; in the Ancient Near Eastern Art section.

==Founders==

Tatiana Kolodzei, along with supporters from the US and Europe (including [[Norton Dodge]]), formed the Kolodzei Art Foundation shortly before the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.  Tatiana's daughter, Natalia Kolodzei (an Honorary Member of the [[Russian Academy of Arts]]), is the Executive Director.  ''[[Robb Report]]'' called Natalia Kolodzei "the person to know" regarding Russian art, and "one of the most influential of Russia's young cultural figures."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://robbreport.com/Bear-Essentials.aspx|title=Bear Essentials|website=The Best Luxury Cars, Jets, Yachts, Travel, Watches {{!}} Robb Report|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015, Natalia Kolodzei was featured in The Robb 50 Connoisseurs: Art; Robb Report, October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://robbreport.com/paid-issue/natalia-kolodzei|title=Natalia Kolodzei|website=The Best Luxury Cars, Jets, Yachts, Travel, Watches {{!}} Robb Report|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:La Revolution Surrealiste cover.jpg|thumb|right|Cover of the first issue of ''La Révolution surréaliste'', December 1924.]]

'''''La Révolution surréaliste''''' (English: ''The Surrealist Revolution'') was a publication by the [[Surrealism|Surrealists]] in Paris. Twelve issues were published between 1924 and 1929.

Shortly after releasing the first ''[[Surrealist Manifesto]]'', [[André Breton]] published the inaugural issue of ''La Révolution surréaliste'' on December 1, 1924.

[[Pierre Naville]] and [[Benjamin Péret]] were the initial directors of the publication and modeled the format of the journal on the conservative scientific review ''[[La Nature]].'' The format was deceiving, and to the Surrealists' delight, ''La Révolution surréaliste'' was consistently scandalous and revolutionary. The journal focused on writing with most pages densely packed with columns of text, but also included reproductions of art, among them works by [[Giorgio de Chirico]], [[Max Ernst]], [[André Masson]] and [[Man Ray]].

==Selected issues==

'''Issue 1''' (December 1924): The cover of the initial issue announced the revolutionary agenda of ''La Révolution surréaliste'' with, "It is necessary to start work on a new declaration of the rights of man."

In a mock scientific fashion the journal explored issues related to the darker sides of the human psyche with articles focused on violence, death and suicide. Detached descriptions of violent crime taken from police reports, and an impartial survey on suicide were included.

'''Issue 3''' (April 1925): The cover of the third issue announced, "End of the Christian Era." Inside articles convey a blasphemous and anticlerical tone. Writer and actor [[Antonin Artaud]] wrote an open letter, "Address to the Pope," and expresses the revolt against what Surrealists saw as oppressive religious values: "The world is the soul's abyss, warped Pope, Pope foreign to the soul. Let us swim in our own bodies, leave our souls within our souls; we have no need of your knife-blade of enlightenment." Such anticlerical remarks are found throughout and reflect the group's relentless campaign against oppression and bourgeois morality.

'''Issue 4''': Breton announced in the fourth issue that he was taking over the publication. His concern about disruptive factions that had developed in the Surrealist group brought him to assert his power and restate the Surrealist principles as he conceived them.

Thereafter, each issue became more political with articles and declarations that have a Communist slant.

'''Issue 8''' (December 1926): The growing fascination with sexual perversion is revealed in an article by [[Paul Éluard]] which celebrates the writings of the [[Marquis de Sade]], who was imprisoned for much of his life because of his deviant writings about sexual cruelty. According to Éluard, the Marquis "wished to give back to civilized man the strength of his primitive instincts." Writing and imagery, influenced by de Sade, by Breton, Man Ray, and [[Salvador Dalí]] was also included.&lt;ref&gt;http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5845125r.image&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Issues 9 and 10''' (October 1927): Introduce [[Exquisite corpse]] (Le Cadavre exquis)&amp;mdash;a game the Surrealists enjoyed that involves folding a sheet of paper so that several people contribute to the drawing of a figure or writing text without seeing the preceding portions. The issue includes some exquisite corpse results.

'''Issue 11''' (): The interest in sex continues in the eleventh issue with "Research into Sexuality," an account of a debate that took place in January 1928. In the frank discussion, more than a dozen Surrealists openly expressed their opinions on sexual matters, including a variety of perversions.

'''Issue 12''' (December 1929): Contains Breton's ''Second [[Surrealist Manifesto]]''. The declaration marks the end of the group's most cohesive and focused years, and signals the start of disagreements within the group. Breton celebrated his faithful supporters, and denounced those who had defected and betrayed his doctrine. Also contains the full script of ''[[Un Chien Andalou]]'' with [[Luis Buñuel]]'s preface.

==After ''La Révolution surréaliste''==

Some of the dissidents voiced their views in the periodical ''Documents'' beginning in April 1929. Writings by ethnographers, archaeologists, and art historians, and poets [[Georges Bataille]] and [[Michel Leiris]] emerged as the main contributors. Some of the ''Documents'' contributors went later formed another group, [[Acéphale]].

Breton's successor to ''La Révolution surréaliste'' was a more politically engaged publication, ''[[Le Surrealisme au service de la revolution]] (Surrealism in the service of the revolution),'' which appeared sporadically between 1930 and 1933.

In 1933, publisher [[Albert Skira]] contacted Breton about a new journal, which he planned to be the most luxurious art and literary review the Surrealists had seen, featuring a slick format with many color illustrations. Skira's restriction was that Breton was not allowed to use the magazine to express his social and political views. Later that year ''[[Minotaure]]'' began publication, and continued publication until 1939.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5182">[[File:LeidenArateaFOlio48vOrion.jpg|thumb|Folio 58v, [[Orion (constellation)|Orion the Hunter]]]]
'''Leiden, Universiteitsbibliotheek, VLQ 79''', also called the '''Leiden Aratea''', is an [[illuminated manuscript|illuminated]] copy of an [[Astronomy|astronomical]] treatise by [[Germanicus]] based on the ''Phaenomena'' of [[Aratus]]. The manuscript was created in the region of [[Lotharingia|Lorraine]] and has been dated to around 816.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Mostert and Marco Mostert, "Using astronomy as an aid to dating manuscripts, The example of the Leiden Aratea planetarium", ''[[Quaerendo]]'', 20 (1999): 248–261.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 99 extant folios measuring {{Convert|225|by|200|mm|in|0}}; four were lost before 1600; this apart, the manuscript is apparently complete. The work contains 39 [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] including some of the first artistic depictions on paper of the Greek constellations. The artist has made no effort to place the stars correctly according to their positions in the sky so the images cannot be considered true star charts.&lt;ref&gt;Ridpath&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Leiden Aratea was created for a wealthy patron, possibly [[Louis the Pious]] or his wife [[Judith, daughter of Welf|Judith]]. Two copies were made of the manuscript in northern [[France]] around the year 1000. [[Jacob Susius]] acquired the manuscript in Ghent in 1573. It was owned by [[Hugo Grotius]] in 1600 and was used as a source for his edition of ''Syntagma Arateorum''.&lt;ref&gt;See the [[:w:c:Category:Prints from Hugo de Groot Syntagma Arateorum at the Peace Palace Library|associated prints from Grotius' ''Syntagma Arateorum'']] on Wikimedia Commons&lt;/ref&gt; It was later in the library of [[Christina of Sweden]] and was subsequently in the possession of [[Isaac Vossius]]. It was acquired by the [[Leiden University Library]] along with the rest of Vossius's collection around 1690.

A facsimile was published in 1989. That same year the book was rebound by Lucie Gimbrére.&lt;ref&gt;De Hamel, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; A digital reproduction of this manuscript can be found on ''Digital Special Collections'' (DISC) of University Library Leiden: [https://socrates.leidenuniv.nl/webclient/DeliveryManager?custom_att_2=simple_viewer&amp;pid=1739618]

==Manuscript==
Constellations, planets and the seasons are depicted in 39 full-page miniatures, all on the verso pages, with corresponding poetical descriptions on the recto. At least five miniatures are lost, including those of the Sun and Moon, Jupiter, and the constellations of Centaurus and Virgo. 
The illustrations are probably copied from a [[Late Antiquity|Late Antique]] version of Germanicus' treatise; the subjects modeled in a "lively, illusionistic" manner typical of ancient painting.&lt;ref&gt;Katzenstein &amp; Savage-Smith, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The text is written in the ''[[capitalis rustica]]'' script used by the Romans for literary manuscripts and kept by the Carolingians for secular works.&lt;ref&gt;De Hamel, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; An exception is folio 93v, the planetarium, where the routes of the planets are inscribed with quotes from Pliny's ''Natural History'' in [[Carolingian minuscule]].&lt;ref&gt;De Hamel, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Macaroni art''', sometimes referred to as '''macaroni crafts''' or '''pasta art''', is artwork that is made of dry [[macaroni]] or [[List of pasta|other pasta]].&lt;ref name="parents"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parents.com/fun/arts-crafts/kid/pasta-crafts/|title=Use Your Noodle: 6 Crafts to Make with Pasta|publisher=parents.com|accessdate=2014-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The works commonly consist of individual pieces of macaroni glued to a surface to produce a [[mosaic]]. However, works may take the form of sculptures.

This type of art is produced during arts and crafts classes at pre-school.&lt;ref name="artistshelpingchildren"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artistshelpingchildren.org/pastacraftsideasactivitieskids.html|title=Pasta Crafts for Kids: Ideas for Arts and Crafts Activities with Spaghetti &amp; Macaroni Noodles for Toddlers, Children, and Preschoolers|publisher=artistshelpingchildren.org|accessdate=2014-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, it has evolved to become an artform practiced by adults.{{Citation needed|reason=Questionable|date=November 2017}}

==In popular culture==
Pasta art was used to advertise a [[Nancy Sinatra]] concert at the world famous [[Fillmore West|Fillmore Auditorium]] in San Francisco. The art the poster was made from is composed entirely of ''Pasta e Fagioli'' (pasta and beans). Alphabet pasta spells out the lyrics for her hit "These Boots Are Made For Walking".&lt;ref name="nancy sinatra"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classicposters.com/Nancy_Sinatra/poster/New_Fillmore_Series/194|title=Nancy Sinatra at the Fillmore Auditorium, San Francisco, CA June 28, 1995|publisher=Classicposters.com|accessdate=2016-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Another example of pasta art was featured in an episode of the television sitcom ''[[Seinfeld]]''. [[Cosmo Kramer]] produced a small sculpture made of [[fusilli]] called "Fusili Jerry".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3533">'''Medium specificity''' is a consideration in [[aesthetics]] and [[art criticism]]. It is most closely associated with [[modernism]], but it predates it.&lt;ref&gt;http://csmt.uchicago.edu/glossary2004/specificity.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Overview==
According to [[Clement Greenberg]], who helped popularize the term, medium specificity holds that "the unique and proper area of competence" for a form of art corresponds with the ability of an artist to manipulate those features that are "unique to the nature" of a particular medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/modernism.html
| title = Modernist Painting
| author = Clement Greenberg
|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060105194921/http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/modernism.html |archivedate = 2006-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in painting, literal flatness and [[Abstract art|abstraction]] are emphasised rather than illusionism and [[figurative art|figuration]].&lt;ref&gt;Vanessa R. Schwartz, Jeannene M. Przyblyski, ''The Nineteenth-Century Visual Culture Reader'', Routledge, 2004, p8. {{ISBN|0-415-30866-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medium specific can be seen to mean that ''"the artwork is constituted by the characteristic qualities of the raw material."'' This would probably include the techniques used to manipulate the materials. ''"Medium-specificity is based on the distinct materiality of artistic media."'' As early as 1776  [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] ''"contends that an artwork, in order to be successful, needs to adhere to the specific stylistic properties of its own medium."''&lt;ref&gt;http://csmt.uchicago.edu/glossary2004/specificity.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the term is used both to describe artistic practices and as a way to analyze [[Visual arts|artwork]].   Critic [[N. Katherine Hayles]], for example, speaks of "media specific analysis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.altx.com/EBR/riposte/rip12/rip12hay.htm

| url = http://www.mala.bc.ca/~soules/animate.htm

|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060224032144/http://www.mala.bc.ca/~soules/animate.htm |archivedate = 2006-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medium specificity suggests that a work of art can be said to be successful if it fulfills the promise contained in the medium used to bring the artwork into existence. Much debate can remain as to what a given medium best lends itself to. 

Art dialogue in the post-modern period has tended to steer away from medium specificity as a particularly relevant principle.&lt;ref&gt;http://csmt.uchicago.edu/glossary2004/specificity.htm Medium Specificity&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''My Wicked, Wicked Ways''''' is an [[autobiography]] written by Australian-born American actor [[Errol Flynn]] with the aid of [[ghostwriter]] [[Earl Conrad]]. It was released posthumously following the death of the actor and became immensely popular for its cynical tone and candid depiction of the world of filmmaking in Hollywood.&lt;ref name="Primary 5–6"&gt;{{cite book| last=Flynn | first=Errol | title= My Wicked, Wicked Ways | publisher=Aurum Press | year=1959 | pages=5–6 |isbn=0-8154-1250-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''My Wicked, Wicked Ways'' has sold over one million copies.&lt;ref name="Primary 5–6"/&gt; The book has never been out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/genius-for-living-driven-by-a-lust-for-death/story-e6frg8px-1225721000349 |title=Genius for living driven by a lust for death |work=[[The Australian]] |date=3 June 2009 |access-date=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing process==
The original publisher, Putnam paid an advance of $9,000 to Flynn for the rights of his autobiography. Ghostwriter Earl Conrad was sent to Flynn's home in Jamaica to collaborate with the actor throughout the writing period. According to [[Beverly Aadland]], Flynn's teenage girlfriend, Conrad was usually drunk and spent most of his time chasing Jamaican women. Aadland also claims that she and Flynn had difficulty removing him, saying "He was basically a doorstop with paid vacation".&lt;ref name="Primary 3–4"&gt;{{cite book| last=Flynn | first=Errol | title= My Wicked, Wicked Ways | publisher=Aurum Press | year=1959 | pages=3–4 |isbn=0-8154-1250-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jeffrey Meyers]]' introduction in the Aurum edition of ''My Wicked, Wicked Ways'' claims that Flynn dictated the book to Conrad from August to October 1958, and that he was a "literary stand in".&lt;ref name="Primary 3–4"/&gt;

Conrad would eventually publish his own book, ''Errol Flynn: A Memoir'' in 1979 depicting Flynn's final year, their literary collaboration, and hearing the news of the actor's early death.


The book is known for its depictions of major figures from the [[Classical Hollywood cinema|Classic Hollywood]] period including [[Jack L. Warner]], [[John Barrymore]], [[Bruce Cabot]], Flynn's first wife [[Lili Damita]] and director [[Michael Curtiz]]. Flynn also writes of falling in love with co-star [[Olivia de Havilland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1193489/Errol-Flynn-He-wicked-way-says-Gone-With-The-Wind-star-Olivia-Havilland.html |title=Errol Flynn? He never had his wicked way with me, says Gone With The Wind star Olivia de Havilland |work=[[Daily Mail]] |last=Andrews |first=Emily |date=17 June 2009 |access-date=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Praise for the book==
"This is a major autobiography in the tradition of Cellini, Casanova, and Frank Harris."
– ''[[The Guardian]]''

"Flynn set the record straight and is brutally honest in his posthumously published self-portrait. This restored version of the 1959 original contains numerous passages deleted from earlier editions for fear of lawsuits—he was equally brutal in his portrayal of many Hollywood big shots—plus eight pages of photos and a new introduction by biographer Jeffrey Meyers."
– ''[[Library Journal]]''

"A document on Hollywood life far beyond its fan magazine fascination… . [Flynn] delivers footnotes to film history that are hard to come by."
– ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''

"The Tasmanian-actor portrays himself not as a debonair swashbuckler but as a chronically unhappy soul whose luck, talent and high spirits vaulted him to fame, even as he remained unfulfilled until the end."
– ''[[Indiana Gazette]]''

"...the confessions of a rake, unsparing of himself or anyone else..."
– ''[[Newsweek]]''

"Incredibly absorbing… . Just as in life, Flynn spares himself nothing—and from his book emerges the same roguish charm that endeared his celluloid incarnation to millions."
– ''[[Saturday Review (US magazine)|Saturday Review]]''

"Flynn writes cleverly, as he talked. He has left us a good book." 
– ''[[The New York Times]]''

==TV movie==
&lt;!-- My Wicked, Wicked Ways: The Legend of Errol Flynn redirects here --&gt;
A TV movie adaptation called '''''My Wicked, Wicked Ways: The Legend of Errol Flynn''''' directed by [[Don Taylor (actor/director)|Don Taylor]] and starring [[Duncan Regehr]] as Flynn was released in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089653/ ''My Wicked, Wicked Ways: The Legend of Errol Flynn'' (TV 1985), IMDb.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Background===
Doris Keating, daughter of [[Barry Mahon]], Flynn's one time business manager, optioned the book in 1977. It took her several years to find finance.

"Some people at the networks felt maybe he just wasn't likable enough," Miss Keating said, "But I persisted. I felt I owed it to him to present his story the way he wrote it. The film is my valentine to him."&lt;ref&gt;"Errol Flynn TV Docudrama Raises Complaints", Farber, Stephen. ''New York Times'', Late Edition (East Coast) [New York, N.Y] 16 January 1985: C.22.&lt;/ref&gt;

She managed to get up the film as a TV movie for CBS. The film focuses on the years 1935 to 1943, ending with the rape trial. Keating said if the film was successful she wanted to do a prequel about Flynn's life in New Guinea, but this did not eventuate.&lt;ref&gt;"TV 'Tribute to Flynn' Won't Be That Wicked: Flynn TV Bio", Richard, Julie. ''Los Angeles Times'' (1923-Current File) [Los Angeles, Calif] 27 December 1983: g1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Netherlands Bach Society''' ({{lang-nl|'''De Nederlandse Bachvereniging'''}}) is the oldest ensemble for [[Baroque music]] in the [[Netherlands]], and possibly in the world. The ensemble was founded in 1921 in [[Naarden]] to perform [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s ''[[St Matthew Passion]]'' on [[Good Friday]] and has performed the work annually since then in the Grote of Sint-Vituskerk (Great Church or St Vitus Church). From 1983 until 2018, [[Jos van Veldhoven]] was artistic director and conductor. On May 11 in 2017, [[Shunsuke Sato]] was appointed as artistic director of the Netherlands Bach Society, beginning from June 1, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bachvereniging.nl/index.php/en/page/3934l ''SHUNSKE SATO NEW ARTISTIC DIRECTOR OF THE NETHERLANDS BACH SOCIETY'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

In 2021 the ensemble will be 100 years old. In preparation the Society is publishing a new and freely accessible recording every week, including [[HD video]] of all 1080 works of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], performed by members of the ensemble and guest musicians under the title ''All of Bach''.

== History ==

=== First years ===

''De Nederlandse Bachvereniging'' was officially founded on 13 September 1921. [[Johan Schoonderbeek]] was one of the founding members and the first conductor.&lt;ref name="MP"&gt;[http://www.allesopeenrij.nl/index.html?page=http://www.allesopeenrij.nl/lijsten/muziek/dirigent_matthauspas.html De dirigenten Matthäus-Passion in Naarden ] allesopeenrij.nl 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He had already conducted the ''St Matthew Passion'' with the Koninklijke Oratorium Vereniging Excelsior (Royal Oratorio Society Excelsior) in [[The Hague]]. The Netherlands Bach Society performed the ''St Matthew Passion'' first on Good Friday, 14 April 1922.&lt;ref name="MP"/&gt; Following the praxis of the period, the work was not performed completely. Performances of the work became a tradition which has been kept since.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;Matthew Gurewitsch: [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/15/arts/music/15gure.html Playing the Numbers When Putting Voice to Bach] [[The New York Times]] 15 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

After Schoonderbeek's death in 1927, [[Evert Cornelis]], conductor of the Utrechts Symfonie Orkest, took over and was the first to conduct the complete work. He died in 1931.&lt;ref name="MP" /&gt;

=== Anthon van der Horst ===

His successor was [[Anthon van der Horst]], who also was the organist of the church. He established regular performances of the ''St Matthew Passion'' and the ''[[Mass in B minor]]'' from 1931 until shortly before his death in 1965, attracting listeners from the Nederlands and abroad. He studied [[facsimile]]s and tried to keep close to the composer's intentions.&lt;ref name="MP" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Bio/Horst-Anthon-van-der.htm Anthon van der Horst (Conductor)] bach-cantatas.com 2001&lt;/ref&gt; In great contrast [[Willem Mengelberg]] conducted regularly on [[Palm Sunday]] in the [[Concertgebouw]] a shortened version of the ''St Matthew Passion'', in a romantic approach with choirs of 450 singers. Nevertheless the performances in Naarden and Amsterdam were similar at first, because orchestra players of the [[Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra|Concertgebouworkest]] and soloists were the same.

=== Charles de Wolff ===

[[Charles de Wolff]] was the successor of Van der Horst in 1965. During this period the Concertgebouw tradition was continued by [[Eugen Jochum]]. The [[historically informed performance]], initiated by [[Nikolaus Harnoncourt]] among others, won friends within the Netherlands Bach Society, who pursued performances with smaller ensembles on period instruments. Therefore De Wolff left the Bach Society in 1983, to work with the ''Bachkoor Holland''.&lt;ref name="MP" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Bio/Wolff-Charles-de.htm Charles de Wolff (Conductor, Organ)] bach-cantatas.com 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

== Program ==

Since 1983 the Netherlands Bach Society has a group of instrumentalists and singers specialized on music of the 17th and 18th century. The Bach Society performs about 50 concerts a year, concentrating on works of Bach and his [[Bach family|family]], his contemporaries and predecessors, such as [[Dietrich Buxtehude|Buxtehude]], [[Giacomo Carissimi|Carissimi]], [[Marc-Antoine Charpentier|Charpentier]], [[Alessandro Grandi|Grandi]], [[Georg Friedrich Händel|Handel]], [[Servaes de Koninck|De Koninck]], [[Johann Kuhnau|Kuhnau]], [[Domenico Mazzocchi|Mazzocchi]], [[Claudio Monteverdi|Monteverdi]], [[Cornelis Padbrué|Padbrué]], [[Christian Ritter|Ritter]], [[Samuel Scheidt|Scheidt]], [[Johann Hermann Schein|Schein]], [[Heinrich Schütz|Schütz]], [[Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck|Sweelinck]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann|Telemann]] and [[Matthias Weckmann|Weckmann]].

The artistic director since 1983 has been [[Jos van Veldhoven]],&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; who conducts about half of the concerts. Guest conductors have included [[Gustav Leonhardt]], [[Paul McCreesh]], [[Philippe Herreweghe]], [[Frans Brüggen]], [[Iván Fischer]] and [[Masaaki Suzuki]]. To keep the experience of the ''St Matthew Passion'' "fresh not only for himself but also for the players and for audiences", guest conductors have been invited every other year. Some of them conducted the work for the first time in Naarden, such as [[Ton Koopman]] and [[René Jacobs]].&lt;ref name="MP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; [[Atzo Nicolaï|Atzo Nicolai]], minister of the Netherlands who regularly attends, stated: "St. Matthew’ during Holy Week is bigger in the Netherlands than [[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]] at Christmas anywhere else".&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

== Education ==

The Netherlands Bach Society has collaborated with schools in a project to create interest in Bach's [[St Matthew Passion]], reaching several hundred students and their teachers. In guest lessons, rehearsals, an interactive CD-Rom and a website, the students are prepared to actually listen to a concert in a well informed way.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9485">[[Image:Codex Sangallensis 1092 recto.jpg|240px|thumb|right|Plan of Saint Gall. Reichenau, early 9th century.]]
The '''Plan of Saint Gall''' is a famous [[medieval]] [[architectural drawing]] of a [[Christian monasticism|monastic]] compound dating from the early 9th century. It is preserved in the [[Abbey library of Saint Gall|Stiftsbibliothek Sankt Gallen]], Ms 1092. 

It is the only surviving major architectural drawing from the roughly 700-year period between the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] and the 13th century. It is considered a [[national treasure]] of [[Switzerland]] and remains an object of intense interest among modern scholars, architects, artists and draftsmen for its uniqueness, its beauty, and the insights it provides into medieval culture.

==Overview==
The Plan depicts an entire [[Rule of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] monastic compound including churches, houses, stables, kitchens, workshops, brewery, infirmary, and even a special house for [[bloodletting]]. The Plan was never actually built, and was so named because it was kept at the famous medieval monastery library of the [[Abbey of St. Gall]], where it remains to this day. It was drawn in a [[scriptorium]] in [[Reichenau Island|Reichenau]] in the third decade of the 9th century, dedicated to [[Gozbert de Saint-Gall|Abbot Gozbert]] (816–836) of [[Abbey of St. Gall|Saint Gall]].

The Plan was created from five [[parchment]]s sewn together measuring 45 inches by 31 inches (113&amp;nbsp;cm by 78&amp;nbsp;cm) and drawn in red ink lines for the buildings, and brown ink for lettered inscriptions. It is drawn to an "unusual" scale of 1:192 (although as explained in detail in "The Plan of St. Gall in brief" by Lorna Price, this is 1/16" to the foot, which would not be so surprising as necessary to place the overall plan onto this size piece of parchment). The reverse of the Plan was inscribed in the 12th century, after it had been folded into book form, with the ''[[Life of Saint Martin]]'' by [[Sulpicius Severus]]. About 350 partly rhyming appendices in the handwritings of two different scribes describe the functions of the buildings. The dedication to Abbot Gozbert is written in the margin.
[[Image:St gall plan.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A copy of the plan]]
Because the plan does not correspond to any place that was actually built,&lt;ref&gt;The abbey church of the medieval period has been excavated in 1964–66, but its form does not reflect that on the plan. Excavations were reported in Horn, ''The Plan of St. Gall'', vol. 2, pp. 256–359.&lt;/ref&gt; just about every aspect of the Plan is disputed by modern scholars. Debates continue on things such as which system of measurement was used; whether the scale is a single scale for the entire plan or varied for different elements; if the plan is a copy from a lost prototype or the original; if it is reflective of a single individual's ideas, or those of monastic council. 

Despite the unknowns, much has been learned about medieval life from the Plan. The absence of heating in the dining hall, for instance, may not have been an oversight but was meant to discourage excessive enjoyment of meals. In the quarters for the 120–150 monks, their guests, and visitors, the ratio of [[toilet seat]]s was better than what modern hygienic codes would prescribe.

===The Dedication===
The plan was dedicated to Gozbertus, the Abbot of St Gall from 816–36. The text reads [as translated by Horn into English]&lt;blockquote&gt;For thee, my sweetest son Gozbertus, have I drawn this briefly annotated copy of the layout of the monastic buildings, with which you may exercise your ingenuity and recognize my devotion, whereby I trust you do not find me slow to satisfy your wishes. Do not imagine that I have undertaken this task supposing you to stand in need of our instruction, but rather believe that out of love of God and in the friendly zeal of brotherhood I have depicted this for you alone to scrutinise. Farewell in Christ, always mindful of us, Amen.&lt;ref&gt;Horn, ''Plan of St. Gall'', vol. 3, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The Latin reads:&lt;blockquote&gt;Haec tibi dulcissime fili cozb(er)te de posicione officinarum paucis examplata direxi, quibus sollertiam exerceas tuam, meamq(ue) devotione(m) utcumq(ue) cognoscas, qua tuae bonae voluntari satisfacere me segnem non inveniri confido. Ne suspiceris autem me haic ideo elaborasse, quod vos putemus n(ost)ris indigere magisteriis, sed potius ob amore(m) dei tibi soli p(er) scrutinanda pinxisse amicabili fr(ater)nitatis intuitu crede. Vale in Chr(ist)o semp(er) memor n(ost)ri ame(n).&lt;ref&gt;Charles McClendon, The Origins of Medieval Architecture (London, 2005), p. 232, n. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Horn and Born===
[[Walter Horn]] and [[Ernest Born]] in 1979 published a 3-volume ''The Plan of St. Gall'' (Berkeley, Calif., University of California Press), which is widely considered to be the definitive work in English. A single-volume condensed edition was published in 1982 as ''The Plan of St. Gall - In Brief''.

According to Horn, the Plan was a copy of an original blueprint of an ideal monastery created at two [[Carolingian]] reform [[synod]]s held at [[Aachen]] in 816 and 817. The purpose of the synods was to establish Benedictine monasteries throughout the Carolingian Empire as a bulwark against encroaching Christian monastic missionaries from Britain and Ireland who were bringing Celtic lifestyle influences to the Continent (see [[Celtic art]]).

===Umberto Eco===
According to Earl Anderson ([[Cleveland State University]]), it is likely that [[Umberto Eco]] references the Plan in his novel ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'':

*"perhaps larger but less well proportioned" (p.&amp;nbsp;26): Adso (a character in the book) mentions actual monasteries that he had seen in Switzerland and France (St. Gall, Cluny, Fontenay), but the standard of "proportion" most likely alludes to the Carolingian (9th century) "Plan of St. Gall," which sets forth an architectural plan for an ideal monastery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csuohio.edu/english/earl/nr27.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050404052144/http://www.csuohio.edu/english/earl/nr27.html |date=April 4, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Models===
The Plan has a tradition of model making. In 1965 Ernest Born and others created a scale model of the Plan for the ''Age of Charlemagne'' exhibition in [[Aachen]], Germany. This became the inspiration for the 1979 book, but was also the first in a tradition of modeling the plan. More recently the Plan has been modeled on computers using [[CAD software]].

===Campus Galli===
{{Main|Campus Galli}}
Campus Galli is a [[Carolingian]] [[monastic community]] under construction in [[Meßkirch]], [[Baden-Württemberg]], [[Germany]]. The construction project includes plans to build a medieval monastery according to the early ninth-century Plan of Saint Gall using techniques from that era. The long-term financing of the project is to come from revenue generated from the site's operation as a tourist attraction. The construction site has been open for visitors since June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Campus Galli - karolingische Klosterstadt Meßkirch [http://www.campus-galli.de/ "Herzlich willkommen bei Campus Galli - karolingische Klosterstadt"] (in German).&lt;/ref&gt;

===St. Gall Project===
The St. Gall Project was founded to produce a digital online presence for the Plan including models and an extensive online database on early medieval monastic culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stgallplan.org |title=Codex Sangallensis 1902 |publisher=Stgallplan.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project is directed by [[Patrick Geary]] ([[UCLA]]) and [[Bernard Frischer]] ([[University of Virginia]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frischerconsulting.com/frischer Bernard Frischer], official website.&lt;/ref&gt; with funding from the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]]. The website was released to the public in December 2007. Future resources will include intellectual and textual aspects of the Plan and monasticism; space for publication of new papers and research, lesson plans and teaching aides, blogs and chat rooms.

'''Potbelly sculptures''', (Spanish '''barrigones''' pl. or '''barrigón''' sing.), are in-the-round sculptures of obese human figures carved from boulders.  They are a distinctive element of the sculptural tradition in the [[southern Maya area]] of [[Mesoamerica]]. The precise purpose of potbelly sculptures is unknown, although they appear to have been the focus of public veneration and ritual directed by the ruling elite.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Sharer 2000, pp.476-477.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this sculptural tradition is found within the southern [[Maya civilization|Maya]] area, it has been recognized that the sculptures themselves are non-Maya.&lt;ref&gt;McInnis Thompson &amp; Valdez 2008, p.13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

Potbelly monuments are generally crude in-the-round sculptures of extremely fat human figures; they are usually seated cross-legged and have enormous swollen stomachs gripped in the figure's arms and legs. The heads are round and normally have the eyes closed and possess puffy eyelids and prominent lips. The monuments are generally of indeterminate gender and are usually carved from [[porphyritic]] [[basalt]], a kind of rock with a combination of large and small grains of mineral that is common along the foothills of [[Central America]]. There are occasional examples of potbelly figures crafted from other materials, such as [[pottery]] or from other types of rock.&lt;ref&gt;McInnis Thompson &amp; Valdez 2008, pp.16-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are variations on the potbelly theme including complete potbelly sculptures, headless potbellies, some of which may be deliberately headless, and potbelly sculptures that consist of only a bodiless head that are recognised as belonging to the style even though they have no potbelly body. Some potbelly sculptures are wearing collars or clothing while others are apparently naked. There are examples with very prominent navels while other sculptures have no emphasis on the navel at all. Some examples of potbelly sculpture have chest ornaments and some sculptures are seated on pedestals. There are examples of potbelly sculptures corresponding to the general type that are not so fat as is the norm.&lt;ref&gt;McInnis Thompson &amp; Valdez 2008, p.18, 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Potbelly sculptures vary enormously in size and weight, from the smallest examples that can weigh as little as a few grams and measure {{convert|4|cm|in}} to monuments that weigh 12 tons and measure {{convert|2|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;McInnis Thompson &amp; Valdez 2008, pp.16-17, 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dating==
The dating of potbelly sculptures has been problematic with few of the earlier known sculptures being found in their original context. Investigators from the 1950s through to the 1970s argued that the style was [[Olmec]] derived or perhaps pre-Olmec.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;McInnis Thompson &amp; Valdez 2008, p.22.&lt;/ref&gt; Olmec culture is judged to have lasted from 1500 BC through to 400 BC based on [[radiocarbon dating]].&lt;ref&gt;Diehl 2004, pp.9, 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Investigations at [[Santa Leticia (Mesoamerican site)|Santa Leticia]] were focused on answering the dating problem and securely dated Santa Leticia Monuments 1 and 3 to between 500 BC and AD 100 using a combination of radiocarbon dating and ceramic evidence.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

The dating of the monuments to the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Preclassic]] indicate that the potbelly style may be a later derivative of earlier [[Olmec colossal heads]], although it does not answer the question of the ethnicity of the sculptors. Potbelly monuments were sometimes reused by later peoples in the region, such as at [[Sin Cabezas]], [[Copán]] and Teopán. Arguing against the theory of potbelly sculpture being an Olmec influenced art form is that the direction of diffusion of the style appears to have been from south to north, while the [[Olmec heartland]] lies to the north, on the coast of the [[Gulf of Mexico]], which would indicate an expected diffusion from north to south if the Olmecs were indeed the origin of the style.&lt;ref&gt;McInnis Thompson &amp; Valdez 2008, pp.22-23. Amaroli, pp.51-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
[[Image:TakalikAbajHead.jpg|thumb|Takalik Abaj Monument 99, a potbelly style colossal head with a puffed face suggestive of a bloated cadaver.]]
Potbelly sculptures have been interpreted in a variety of manners. Investigators have theorised that potbelly sculptures represent dead ancestors. Alternatively, they have been associated with babies or with the poorly understood Fat God of Mesoamerican mythology. Potbelly monuments have also been associated with a group of [[Household deity|supernatural entities]] associated with the domestic [[hearth]].&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;McInnis Thompson &amp; Valdez 2008, p.23.&lt;/ref&gt; A further interpretation, based on the sculpture found at Teopán in western El Salvador, interprets potbelly figures as pregnant women at full term, possibly in the very act of giving birth.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Amaroli, pp.51-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

One theory is that the sculptures represent deceased individuals with bloated bodies, closed eyes, distended bellies and puffed out faces. The position of the limbs on some monuments, although following the natural contours of the boulder, give an impression of the position of corpses found in later Maya burial bundles. It is possible that [[Pasaco]] Monument 2 and the potbelly from [[San Juan Sacatepéquez]] portray the placement of a [[jade]] bead in the mouth of the sculpture. Although it has been suggested that the monuments themselves are burial markers, only three sculptures have been found directly associated with human remains.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; One of these is a ceramic potbelly from [[Colha, Belize|Colha]] in [[Belize]], the others are from [[Chalchuapa]] and [[Kaminaljuyu]]. However, since most potbelly monuments were not found in their original locations it is impossible to know whether they originally served as burial markers.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;McInnis Thompson &amp; Valdez 2008, p.24.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:La Democracia 5.jpg|thumb|left|A potbelly sculpture from Monte Alto, on display in La Democracia]]
An alternative interpretation of potbelly monuments is that they were representations of rulership. This is suggested by the body position represented in the sculptures, the type of adornment sometimes depicted on them, the pedestals on which they sometimes sit and the ceremonial sites where they are found as well as their locations within such sites. The potbelly body position is symbolic of rulership; the figures are seated cross-legged and with the arms wrapping the body or holding an object. Twenty-five potbelly monuments are known to display a collar as neck jewellery, again suggestive of rulership. Pedestal bases are known from potbelly sculptures from Sin Cabezas, [[Antigua Guatemala]], Kaminaljuyu, [[Santa Cruz del Quiché]], [[Takalik Abaj]], [[Tikal]], [[Ujuxte]], [[El Balsamo]], [[Los Cerritos, Guatemala|Los Cerritos]] and [[La Nueva]] in [[Guatemala]], Chalchuapa in [[El Salvador]], and Copán in [[Honduras]]. This represents 42% of sites with potbelly sculptures. If pedestals are equivalent to thrones then [[Bilbao (Mesoamerican site)|Bilbao]] Monument 58 is also relevant, which was found associated with a four-legged stone altar or throne and may originally have been positioned on top of it.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

The diversity of monuments falling within the potbelly sculptural tradition and the individuality of the monuments support the argument that the monuments represent individual rulers. The monuments may have been viewed by the ancient peoples of the region as a depiction of both rulership and their ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;McInnis Thompson &amp; Valdez 2008, p.25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
[[Image:Formative Period southern Mesoamerica 2.svg|right|thumb|350px|The Pacific coastal zone of southern Mesoamerica showing the core of the potbelly distribution zone.]]
Potbelly sculptures are distributed along the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] slope of southern Mesoamerica from [[Chiapas]] in [[Mexico]], through Guatemala to El Salvador, as well as in the Guatemalan highlands. A few examples have been found further afield in the [[Geography of Mesoamerica|Maya lowlands]] of Guatemala and Honduras.&lt;ref&gt;McInnis Thompson &amp; Valdez 2008, pp.13, 19.&lt;/ref&gt; A ceramic potbelly figure was found as far away as Colha in northern Belize and has been dated to c.880&amp;ndash;600 BC, in the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Middle Preclassic]].&lt;ref&gt;McInnis Thompson &amp; Valdez 2008, p.19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The core of the distribution area falls within a humid [[foothills|piedmont]] zone with the land consisting of volcanic soil and rubble carried down from the mountains, with naturally occurring basalt boulders of varying sizes that provided a practical raw material for sculpture.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt; Potbelly sculptures are found in prominent ceremonial centres.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

Examples have been found at many sites on the Pacific coast of Guatemala including Takalik Abaj, [[Monte Alto culture|Monte Alto]], Bilbao and [[El Baúl]]. The earliest examples of potbellied monuments have been dated to the Middle Preclassic, with the majority dating to the Late Preclassic.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Well-preserved examples of Late Preclassic potbelly sculptures have been found at Bilbao, on the coastal plain, and at Kaminaljuyu in the Guatemalan highlands.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.245.&lt;/ref&gt; A small potbelly monument has been found at the major Maya city of Tikal in the lowlands of [[Petén Basin|Petén]] in Guatemala.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer 2000, p.476.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:La Democracia 1.jpg|thumb|right|Colossal head in potbelly style on display in [[La Democracia, Escuintla]] and originally from Monte Alto.]]
There is some variation in the exact features, those at Kaminaljuyu have fat bodies with short, thick necks and large heads, sometimes wearing a wide collar. The faces are depicted with incised lines and are heavy and coarse. The legs curve around the body parallel to the ground and the arms are clasped against the torso with the elbows bent.&lt;ref&gt;McInnis Thompson &amp; Valdez 2008, pp.16-17.&lt;/ref&gt; Kaminaljuyu has the greatest concentration of potbelly sculptures in any site, with several of them found concentrated in the Palangana monument plaza.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

Large potbelly monuments have been found at Giralda, a site {{convert|6|km|mi}} from the Pacific coastline.&lt;ref&gt;Bove &amp; Medrano Busto 2003, p.77.&lt;/ref&gt;

Potbelly sculptures from Sin Cabezas are stylistically related to Olmec sculpture but were reused by later peoples, being found in [[fill (archaeology)|fill]] dating to the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Classic]] period. The monuments at Sin Cabezas were headless when they were found and no fragments of the missing heads were evident, suggesting that they had already been damaged when they were re-erected by later occupants of the site.&lt;ref&gt;McInnis Thompson &amp; Valdez 2008, pp.22-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

At Takalik Abaj the potbelly style monuments all date to the Late Preclassic. Stylistically, the monuments are very similar to those of Kaminaljuyu and Monte Alto. Seven monuments are potbelly sculptures (Monuments 2, 3, 19, 40, 69, 94 and 117), six of these represent complete figures. Three monuments are small potbelly sculptures (Monuments 100, 107 and 109) and one sculpture is a colossal head in potbelly style (Monument 99).&lt;ref name="auto7"/&gt;

One potbelly sculpture was found in [[Chocolá]], Guatemala.&lt;ref&gt;Guernsey 2012, p.50.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Honduras===
At Copán in Honduras, another important Maya site, archaeologists found a potbelly sculpture on top of the Northwest Platform, to the west of the Great Plaza. Another was found in a cache under Stela 4. Further potbelly monuments have been found in caches under Late Classic [[Maya stelae|stelae]] in the Great Plaza itself and throughout the Copán valley.&lt;ref&gt;Fash 2005, pp.78-79.&lt;/ref&gt;

===El Salvador===
A small example excavated from underneath the Late Preclassic levels of Structure E3-1 at Chalchuapa in El Salvador may date to the Middle Preclassic.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer 2000, pp.476-477. Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.245.&lt;/ref&gt; Three potbelly monuments were found resting on a large terrace in Santa Leticia in El Salvador, a site near Chalchuapa consisting of various mounds and platforms. These monuments were large and especially obese.&lt;ref&gt;Cobos 1994, 1998, p.56. Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.245.&lt;/ref&gt; Santa Leticia Monuments 1 and 3 were important in securely dating the potbelly style of sculpture.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; The El Salvador potbellies conform to the Monte Alto style of boulder sculpture.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

In Chalchuapa, potbelly monuments were grouped in the El Trapiche ceremonial centre.&lt;ref&gt;McInnis Thompson &amp; Valdez 2008, pp.24-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Santa Leticia Monument 1 is a nearly spherical potbelly sculpture and the smallest of the three potbelly monuments at the site, measuring {{convert|1.6|m|ft}} high. Monument 2 is a massive {{convert|2|m|ft|adj=on}} high potbelly that has been split in half down the middle. Monument 3 is a finely carved potbelly figure with stylistic affinities to some of the sculptures found at Monte Alto in Guatemala, it measures {{convert|1.8|m|ft}} high. All three sculptures measured {{convert|1.5|to|2|m|ft}} in height and diameter. The monuments were arranged in a north-south line on a {{convert|70|m|ft|adj=on}} wide terrace projecting from a hill, Cerrito de Apaneca.&lt;ref&gt;Demarest et al. 1982, pp.558, 560-562.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Teopán potbelly clearly represents a female figure and has been interpreted as the sculpture of a Late Preclassic earth goddess.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Teopán itself is a small site located on an island in [[Coatepeque Caldera|Lake Coatepeque]] in western El Salvador.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; The site has been identified as that of Late [[Preclassic Maya]] settlement.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Although the Teopán sculpture has typical Monte Alto-style traits such as closed puffy eyes, no neck, wrap-around arms, a clearly marked naval and grooves forming portions of the nose and mouth, it also includes some unusual features such as clearly indicated breasts, wide hips, buttocks and a {{convert|10|cm|in|adj=on}} concavity below the legs.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; The closed eyelids were later re-carved with the addition of two irregular oval concavities in order to represent open eyes, probably in the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Postclassic Period]].&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; The Teopán potbelly is likely to be the idol mentioned by Spanish Colonial official Diego García de Palacio in a letter written in 1576, in which he mentions that the [[Pipil people|Pipil]] natives on the island worshipped "a large stone idol in the form of a woman".&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

This is a '''list of psychedelic literature''', works related to [[psychedelic drug]]s and the [[psychedelic experience]]. '''Psychedelic literature''' has also been defined as textual works that arose from the proliferation of psychiatric and psychotherapeutic research with [[hallucinogen]]s during the 1950s and early 1960s in North America and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/bitstream/handle/10036/4207/DickinsR.pdf The Birth of Psychedelic Literature: Drug Writing and the rise of LSD Therapy 1954 – 1964]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2047">The '''Raimondi Stele''' is a sacred object and a major piece of art of the [[Chavín culture]] of the central [[Andes]] in present-day [[Peru]]. The [[stele]] is seven feet high, made of highly polished [[granite]], with a lightly incised design which is almost unnoticeable on the sculpture. For this reason, the design is best studied from a drawing. It is housed in the courtyard of the ''[[Museo Nacional de Arqueología Antropología e Historia del Perú]]'' in [[Lima]]. [[File:A detail of the Raimondi Stela.png|thumb|250px|A detail of the Raimondi Stele]]

Chavin artists frequently used the technique of [[contour rivalry]] in their art forms, and this indigenous deity is considered{{By whom|date=November 2010}} one of the finest known examples of this technique. Contour rivalry means that the lines in an image can be read in multiple ways, depending on which way the object is being viewed. When the Raimondi Stela is viewed one way, the image depicts a fearsome deity holding two Huachuma cactus. His eyes look upward toward his large, elaborate headdress of snakes and volutes. When flipped upside-down, the same image can be seen differently. The headdress can be "read" as a stacked row of smiling, fanged faces, while the deity's face has turned into the face of a smiling reptile. The deity's staffs also appear to be rows of stacked faces.

This technique speaks to larger Andean concerns of the duality and reciprocal nature of nature, life, and society.  This theme is found in the art of many other Andean indigenous civilizations.

'''Real Canadian Superstore''' is a chain of supermarkets owned by Canadian food retailing giant [[Loblaw Companies]].  Its name is often shortened to '''Superstore'''.

Originating in [[Western Canada]] in the late 1970s/early 1980s, the banner expanded into [[Ontario]] in the early 2000s as Loblaw attempts to fend off competition from department stores including [[United States|U.S.]]-based [[Walmart Canada|Walmart]].

Loblaw has tested alternative banners at some locations in Ontario, with some labelled as "'''Loblaw Superstore'''", and a few others as simply "Superstore"; for a time this was reflected in the chain's marketing which used a separate logo to advertise all of these banners. The company has since reverted to marketing the entire chain as Real Canadian Superstore, although some locations might retain other signage.

==Overview==
[[File:Real Canadian Superstore Logo.jpg|thumb|Logo used from 2005 to 2017, still in use at the majority of locations.|250x250px]]
[[File:rcsswest.png|thumb|250px|Logo used until 2005]]
[[File:BH SuperstoreLoblaw.jpg|thumb|250px|Logo previously used in advertising in Ontario; generic type for both Loblaw Superstore and Real Canadian Superstore]]

The stores carry a variety of goods, but the vast majority of space is devoted to groceries and about a third of each store is set aside for electronics, housewares, and clothing. Items in the latter two categories are mainly from Loblaw's private labels, such as [[President's Choice]], Life at Home, or [[Joe Fresh]]. As with many Loblaw stores, they offer corporate-branded services such as PhotoLab photo finishing and DrugStore [[pharmacy|pharmacies]]. Many outlets also boast a [[GoodLife Fitness]] club, drive-through pharmacies, [[Mobil]] gas bars, photo studios, community rooms, as well as walk-in medical clinics managed by [[Primacy Medical]].

Loblaws is working to cut costs and compete effectively with this multi-format store. Each store has a similar layout, useful for both cost efficiency and shopper ease. Also, in an effort to cater to individual customer segments, Superstore buys specific products for different regions. Superstore locations now top {{convert|20000|m2|sqft|}}.

In the west, Superstores are operated by Loblaw subsidiary Westfair Foods Ltd. [[Ontario]] stores are operated as part of Loblaw's other banners, including [[Loblaws]] and [[Zehrs]], although Superstore is considered a separate chain, and prices at one chain may not apply at the other. Loblaw is centralizing its head office operations, which includes the relocation of the General Merchandise personnel from Calgary, Alberta to Brampton, Ontario to consolidate operations.

In [[Alberta]], where [[Alcoholic beverages in Canada|private liquor retailing is permitted]], a chain of 30 [[Real Canadian Liquorstore]]s operate, mostly  in proximity to Real Canadian Superstore locations in the province.

Employees of Loblaws and the Real Canadian Superstore are members of the [[United Food and Commercial Workers]] (UFCW) union.

==History==

The first Real Canadian Superstore location opened in March 1979 in a former Loblaws location in [[Saskatoon]], [[Saskatchewan]] under the name [[SuperValu (Canada)|SuperValu]]. Numerous other SuperValu locations opened across Western Canada before most gradually expanded into Superstore sites; the SuperValu name is still in use in British Columbia and the [[Maritimes]], the latter branded as Atlantic SuperValu.

The similarly named ''The Real Superstore'' was used in the [[United States]] from the 1970s up until the mid-1990s by the Loblaws-owned [[National Supermarkets]] chain until the chain was purchased by competitor [[Schnucks]].

Superstore marks the return of Loblaw's superstore format in the [[Greater Toronto Area]] after the unsuccessful launch of the [[SuperCentre]] format in the 1980s and 1990s.  In the early 21st century, Loblaw brought the Superstore banner to Ontario as a response to the introduction of large grocery sections in most Canadian Wal-Mart stores and other department stores, and as a pre-emptive strike against any plans by Wal-Mart to bring its "Supercenter" format to Canada. Originally, Ontario stores were co-branded with the local Loblaw banner (i.e., "Loblaws - The Real Canadian Superstore"), but most shortened their name to reduce confusion and allow separate weekly specials for each chain.

New Ontario locations began to open under the name Loblaw Superstore in late 2007. Since December 2008, Ontario stores have used common flyers displaying a combined "Superstore: Loblaw / Real Canadian" logo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.superstore.ca/ontario/ Superstore Ontario website], accessed December 8, 2008,&lt;/ref&gt; However, Loblaw has not yet said whether one banner will eventually replace the other.

==Relationship with other Loblaw banners==
There are no Superstore locations as such in [[Atlantic Canada]] or [[Quebec]]. However, in recent years, and particularly since 2008, [[Atlantic Superstore]] in the Maritimes and [[Dominion Stores (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Dominion]] in Newfoundland and Labrador, both also owned by Loblaw, have adopted similar store formats and a similar marketing approach to RCSS. In Quebec, [[Maxi (Canadian supermarket)|Maxi and Co.]] and some larger Provigo (previously Loblaws) locations fill the void. It is not clear whether Loblaw intends to eventually rebrand these stores to create a national "Superstore" chain.

As well, there are a handful of large-format Loblaws and Zehrs stores in Ontario – including certain locations in [[Markham,_Ontario|Markham]], [[Ottawa]], and [[Kitchener,_Ontario|Kitchener]] – which closely replicate the selection of food and general merchandise available at Superstores. Most of these locations were built around the same time as the first Ontario Superstores, but nevertheless chose to use older brand names.

== Slogans ==
2018 - "Truly Super"

2017 - "We’re not just a store, we’re Superstore. And we don’t do average"

2016 - "Worth Switching Supermarkets For"

2008- 2015 - "Big on Fresh, Low on Price"

'''St. Maurus reliquary''' is a [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] [[reliquary]] exhibited in the castle of [[Bečov nad Teplou]] in the west of the [[Czech Republic]].  It is considered to be the second most important historical artefact in the Czech territory after the [[Czech Crown Jewels]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.czecot.com/en/?id_tema=222 Saint Maur and Cognac]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The reliquary was created for [[Florennes Abbey]] in [[Belgium]] in the first quarter of the 13th century to hold the purported skeletal remains of [[St. Maurus]], [[St. John the Baptist]], and [[St. Timothy]].&lt;ref name="Becov"&gt;[http://www.zamek-becov.cz/the-shrine-st-maurus/ "The shrine St Maurus"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518082647/http://www.zamek-becov.cz/the-shrine-st-maurus/ |date=2015-05-18 }} zamek-becov.cz Retrieved December 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  The wooden core is covered with [[gilded silver]] plate with many statuettes, reliefs, [[filigree]] decorations and [[Gemstone|gems]]. After the sacking of Florennes the reliquary was placed in the local church and later bought by Duke [[Alfred de Beaufort-Spontin]] in 1838. The Duke restored the damaged artifact and loaned it to the [[Anwerp International|Brussels Exhibition of 1885]].  By 1888, the Beauforts transported it to their castle estate in Bečov.&lt;ref name="Becov"/&gt; 

The house of Beaufort cooperated with the [[Nazi Party]] during [[World War II]] and was forced to leave the country in 1945.&lt;ref name="Becov"/&gt; Shortly before the end of the war, the reliquary was buried beneath the floor in the chapel and effectively forgotten. In 1984, American businessman Danny Douglas approached Czechoslovak authorities (via the embassy in Vienna) with an offer to pay 250,000 USD for the right to excavate and export abroad an otherwise unidentified object “''which nobody here misses anyway''”. From the fragments of information provided, the authorities initiated a search operation to verify the nature of the "object" and find it.&lt;ref name="Becov"/&gt;  This operation was led by JUDr. František Maryška, the head of Federal investigation bureau at that time. From the fragments of information provided his team was able to narrow the investigation to 5 possible locations and 3 weeks before the business was to be performed they were able to identify that the "object" must be located in Bečov Castle or surrounding area. Police officers arrived to the location with a large team of men and with metal detectors and were searching all the surroundings, digging several holes in garden and outside the castle. Since the weather was bad and Douglas was not worried about snow or frozen earth they concluded that the object must be inside. So they started with the search inside on places where a hidden room was anticipated or where such an object might fit.  When searching the floor in the old castle chapel they identified that a large metallic object was below and after removing the wooden boards they discovered the St. Maurus reliquary on 5 November 1985. 

==Restoration==

The reliquary had decayed significantly after its decades of burial.  The Czech authorities, after refusing to allow the relic's export and working to resolve ownership disputes, began an extensive restoration which lasted from 1991 by restorers from Prague's Museum of Applied Arts and preservation experts from the German town of [[Aachen]]. The restoration was complete in 2002 and the artifact was then returned to Bečov.&lt;ref name="Becov"/&gt; The shrine has since been on public display in both the Bečov Castle and [[Prague Castle]].

==Description==

The reliquiary is a large [[Chasse (casket)|chasse]], or house-shaped casket, with a wooden structure covered by [[silver-gilt]] plates, with 12 small statues of saints, elaborate romanesque metalwork ornamentation, and a number of gems, including [[engraved gem]]s from earlier periods.&lt;ref name="Becov"/&gt; 

The golden vessel is presumed to house some remains attributed to St. [[John the Baptist]], [[Saint Timothy]], with remains of [[Saint Maurus]] added later.&lt;ref name="Becov"/&gt;

'''Ridiculusmus''' is an award-winning&lt;ref name="housetheatre"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://housetheatre.org.uk/companies/ridiculusmus-2/ |title=Ridiculusmus – house |publisher=Housetheatre.org.uk |date= |accessdate=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; British theatre company founded in 1992 by Angus Barr, Jon Haynes and David Woods.&lt;ref name="British Council" &gt;{{cite web|title=Ridiculusmus|url=http://www.britishcouncil.org/arts-performanceinprofile-2010-ridiculusmus.htm|work=April 2010|publisher=British Council|accessdate=28 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their work has been described as "seriously funny," "Dadaist" and "physical theatre." Theatre critic [[Ian Shuttleworth]] said that Ridiculusmus is "not so much rough theatre as completely dishevelled." Since 1996, the company has been led by Haynes and Woods as co-directors, and although the majority of their stage works in recent years have been [[two-hander]]s, they additionally work with a large pool of collaborators.

Their first few productions were adaptations of novels, but, apart from a two-man version of ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]],'' produced in 2005, since 1997 Haynes and Woods have devised and written all Ridiculusmus' plays. Some of these have been published by [[Oberon Books]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doollee.com/PlaywrightsR/ridiculusmus.html |title=Ridiculusmus – Playwright |publisher=Doollee.com |date=19 May 2011 |accessdate=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and commissioned by the [[Barbican]], London.&lt;ref name="heraldscotland"&gt;{{cite web|author=Mary Brennan |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/arts-ents/music/ridiculusmus-bring-total-football-to-the-tron-glasgow.20506173 |title=Ridiculusmus bring Total Football to The Tron, Glasgow |publisher=Herald Scotland |date=19 March 2013 |accessdate=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early years ==

The founding members met as students at London's [[The Poor School|Poor School]] and while there they began [[busking]] on the [[London underground]] and doing comedy club open spots. They called themselves Mel, Pat &amp; Harm, and performed comic songs from the 1920s and 1930s to the accompaniment of Barr's ukulele. They also opened a [[Dadaist]] comedy club called The Tomato Club&lt;ref name="theguardian"&gt;{{cite web|author=John O'Mahony |url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/feb/13/theatre1 |title=John O'Mahony meets the anarchic duo behind cult group Ridiculusmus &amp;#124; Stage |publisher=The Guardian |date=13 February 2008 |accessdate=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; above a couscous restaurant in [[Kentish Town]]. The highlight of the evening was the "tomato spot," in which comics were invited to perform deliberately bad material to an audience armed with over-ripe tomatoes. The listing in ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' said "Don't come," to which the magazine added "probably advice worth taking."

On graduating from The Poor School, Ridiculusmus filled a cancelled slot at London's [[Canal Cafe Theatre]] with a hastily produced adaptation of [[Jerome K. Jerome]]'s ''[[Three Men in a Boat]].'' It played to mixed reviews and encouraged the troupe to produce more adaptations; their next production was a [[promenade]] version of [[Flann O'Brien]]'s cult classic novel ''[[The Third Policeman]].'' Opening at Aras na Gael, the show, with free pints of The Wrastler stout given to any audience member bringing a bicycle part,&lt;ref name="theguardian" /&gt; became an instant small scale hit. Adding fellow Poor School graduates Kevin Henshall and Lucy Cuthbertson, the company grew to five members.  Finding it difficult to survive in London, Ridiculusmus began to tour, and jumped at an offer to be in residence at The Playhouse in [[Derry]], Northern Ireland.&lt;ref name="heraldscotland" /&gt; A trio once again—Woods and Haynes adapted another O'Brien novel, ''[[At Swim-Two-Birds]]'',&lt;ref name="theguardian" /&gt; which toured widely.

== ''The Sister Mary Sessions'' ==

In 1996 Ridiculusmus broke away from the adaptation of novels and began writing and producing their own work. The development season in the Sister Mary room at the playhouse in Derry resulted in three self-authored pieces, ''School'', ''The Exhibitionists'' and ''Christmas.''

''The Exhibitionists'' went on to tour nationally and internationally over the next six years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fishingheritage.org/bacarchive/items/show/17 |title=BAC Archive &amp;#124; Ridiculusmus Archive – Exhibitionists. Misc. Prog. Archive |publisher=Fishingheritage.org |date= |accessdate=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ARSEFLOP ==

In 1999 Woods and Haynes coined the [[acrostic]] [[mnemonic]] ARSEFLOP to articulate their working principles: Attitude, Reality, Sensitivity, Edge, Focus, Listen, Open Your Heart and Play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ridiculusmus.com/about-us/#more-29 |title=About us |publisher=Ridiculusmus |date= |accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rayes|first=Honour|title=Ridiculusmus (Continued)|url=http://exeuntmagazine.com/features/ridiculusmus/2/|work=May 20, 2011|publisher=Exeunt|accessdate=28 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later works ==

Ridiculusmus has created seven more main stage works in the last 15 years: ''Say Nothing''; ''Ideas Men''; ''Tough Time, Nice Time''; ''Total Football'';  ''The World Mouse Plague''; ''The Eradication of Schizophrenia in Western Lapland'' and ''[http://www.ridiculusmus.com/shows/current-show/give-me-your-love-2 Give Me Your Love]''. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ridiculusmus.com/category/shows/repertoire/ |title=Repertoire |publisher=Ridiculusmus |date= |accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ridiculusmus|url=http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/funding/browse-regularly-funded-organisations/npo/ridiculusmus/|work=2012|publisher=Arts Council|accessdate=28 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/discover-more/artists/joanna-crowley |title=Joanna Crowley &amp;#124; National Theatre &amp;#124; South Bank, London |publisher=National Theatre |date= |accessdate=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sophie Byrne''' is an Australian film and TV producer, best known for the [[Academy Award]] winning animated short ''[[The Lost Thing]]''.

== Career ==
Byrne worked as a Senior Producer at Passion Pictures London for ten years. There she produced many award-winning projects, including the initial pilot for the hugely successful concept band [[Gorillaz]] - created by [[Jamie Hewlett]] ([[Tank Girl]] comic) and [[Damon Albarn]] ([[Blur (band)|Blur]]) - and their seminal ‘[[Clint Eastwood (song)|Clint Eastwood]]’ music video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.annecy.org/about/archives/2001/official-selection/film-index:film-20010454|title=Annecy &gt; About &gt; Archives &gt; 2001 &gt; Official Selection &gt; Film Index|first=©|last=CITIA|work=annecy.org|accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning to Melbourne, Australia in 2002 Byrne started Passion Pictures Australia,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.passion-pictures.com.au&lt;/ref&gt; optioned the acclaimed cult concept [[Scarygirl]] and has worked closely with artist [[Nathan Jurevicius]] to successfully expand the brand across all media&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.theage.com.au/screenplay/archives/012078.html|title=The Age Blogs: Screen Play|work=theage.com.au|accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; including producing the online gaming prototype, which was nominated for the 2009 AFI Screen Content Innovation Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aacta.org/winners-nominees/2000-2010/2009.aspx|title=AFI - AACTA - Winners &amp; Nominees - 2000-2010 - 2009|work=aacta.org|accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2255">{{Unreferenced|date=March 2007}}The '''surprise factor''' is a technique used in [[storytelling]] to produce a [[visceral]] reaction from the audience.  It is created by telling a story in a way which creates a certain perception of events which is then revealed to be false often in exact opposition to original perception.  The term most often refers to its use in many forms of [[humour]] which provides the audience with the [[wiktionary:twist#English|twist]] or [[punch line]], intended to elicit [[amusement]].  However it can also be used to elicit a [[tragic]] reaction, rather than a comic one. 

It has been theorised that the essence of humour lies in two elements or factors, the ''relevance factor'', and the ''[[surprise (emotion)|surprise]] factor''.  First, it is necessary to present something familiar or relevant to the audience.  This accounts for gaining the involvement and scrutiny of the audience, who may believe they know the natural follow-through thoughts or conclusion.  Next, the actual [[amusement]] results from the presentation of some twist on what the audience expected, or else from interpreting the original situation in an unexpected way.  These twists and unexpected interpretations may be summarized as the surprise factor.

For this reason, knowing a [[punch line]] in advance, or some situation which would flub the delivery of the punchline, can destroy the surprise factor, and in turn destroy the entertainment value or [[amusement]] the joke may have otherwise provided; such information is known in some contexts as a [[spoiler (media)|spoiler]].  On the other hand, a person previously holding the same unexpected conclusions or secret perspectives as the [[comedian]] could derive amusement from hearing those same thoughts expressed and elaborated.  That there is commonality, unity of thought, and an ability to openly analyze and express these (where secrecy and inhibited exploration was previously thought necessary) can be the surprise factor in these situations.  This phenomenon explains much of the success of comedians who deal with same-gender and same-culture audiences on gender conflicts and cultural topics, respectively.

The '''Teatro Comunale Pergolesi''' is an [[opera house]] in [[Jesi]], Italy. It was  originally named the '''Teatro della Concordia''' when it was the rival to the original 1732 opera house in the city, the Teatro del Leone. That theatre was active until 1791, but it was destroyed by fire in 1892.&lt;ref name="Lynn"&gt;Lynn, pp. 167-170&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the Concordia began in 1790 with a request to the city government to allow construction of a new opera house on the Plaza della Morte (now the Plaza della Republica), an area in need of re-development and revival. The city agreed on the basis of holding two boxes for itself and, with some interruptions for a variety of reasons, completion  was achieved in time for the opening during the Carnival of 1798 with Portogallo's ''Lo spazzacamino principe''.  The house consisted of four tiers of boxes, 100 in total, all sold to wealthy subscribers.

Modifications took place in 1835 to create a gallery by removing the fourth tier of boxes and creating a better entrance to the orchestra level. The 170th anniversary of the composer local-born composer [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]] caused the renaming in his honour, although as is noted, it took a further three years for this to come into effect.&lt;ref name="Lynn"/&gt;

By 1925 the need for repairs had grown acute and the surviving heirs of the original construction, the Società Teatrale, were unable to continue to support the theatre, which in March 1929 was acquired by the city.

The theatre is still in use today, "one of the few opera houses in Italy from the late 1700s that has never been destroyed by fire or bombs"&lt;ref name="Lynn"/&gt;  It was completely renovated in 1995 and is currently managed by the [[Pergolesi Spontini Foundation]].

'''The evening of Ashura''' ({{lang-fa|عصر عاشورا}}) is a painting by [[Mahmoud Farshchian]]. The central motif is sadness and sorrow of [[Husayn ibn Ali]]’s family while crying around his horse coming back without its rider. Husayn ibn Ali was killed in [[battle of Karbala]]. Farshchian dedicated his work to museum of [[Astan Quds Razavi]] in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.yjc.ir/fa/news/4639213/%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%84%D9%88%DB%8C-%D8%B9%D8%B5%D8%B1-%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%B4%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D9%85%D8%AD%D9%85%D9%88%D8%AF-%D9%81%D8%B1%D8%B4%DA%86%DB%8C%D8%A7%D9%86-%DA%86%DA%AF%D9%88%D9%86%D9%87-%D8%AE%D9%84%D9%82-%D8%B4%D8%AF | title=How Mahmoud Farshchian's painting about the evening of Ashura is developed? | publisher=YJC | accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahmoud Farshchian (born January 24, 1930) is a [[Persian art| Persian painter]] and [[Persian miniature|miniaturist]]. He was born in the city of [[Isfahan]] and started to learn art, painting and sculpting. His works have been hosted by several museums and exhibitions worldwide. He is the most modernizer of the field of miniatures, an art form which was first established in [[Ancient Persia]] and later spread to [[China]] and [[Turkey]] and other Middle Eastern countries. In addition, the design of the [[Zarih]], roof, door and cellar in the shrine of [[Ali al-Ridha]], the 8th [[Shia Imam]], in [[Mashhad]] and his membership in the committee supervising the construction of the shrine, is among work of him.&lt;ref name="Farshchian"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tebyan.net/newindex.aspx?pid=934&amp;articleID=509616 | title=Biography of Mahmoud Farshchian | publisher=Tebyan | accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Title and subject ==
The Evening of Ashura is about the killing of [[Husayn ibn Ali]] in [[battle of Karbala]] who is unseen in the illustration and his horse is depicted returning to the tents alone, highlighting his martyrdom. There are women and young girls who are crying their hearts out at the feet of the charger which is back from the battle without bringing its rider back. There is an untidy saddle with pigeons hit by arrows falling on the saddle.&lt;ref name="resistart"&gt;{{cite web | first1=Mojdeh | last1=Morad Ganjeh | url=http://resistart.ir/content/%D8%AA%D8%AD%D9%84%DB%8C%D9%84-%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%84%D9%88%DB%8C-%D8%B9%D8%B5%D8%B1-%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%B4%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%A7-%D8%A7%D8%AB%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D9%81%D8%B1%D8%B4%DA%86%DB%8C%D8%A7%D9%86/ | title=Analyzing into the evening of Ashura, work of Master Farshchian | publisher=Resistart | accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iranreview"&gt;{{cite web | first1=Shahram | last1=Za’feranlou | url=http://www.iranreview.org/content/Documents/Analysis-of-The-Evening-of-Ashura-Painting.htm | title=Analysis of “The Evening of Ashura” Painting | publisher=Iranreview | accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Motorcycle Diaries''''' ({{lang-es|Diarios de Motocicleta|links=no}}) is a [[memoir]] that traces the early travels of [[Marxist]] revolutionary [[Ernesto "Che" Guevara]], then a 23-year-old medical student, and his friend [[Alberto Granado]], a 29-year-old biochemist. Leaving [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], in January 1952 on the back of a sputtering single cylinder 1939 [[Norton Motorcycle Company|Norton]] 500cc dubbed ''La Poderosa'' ("The Mighty One"), they desired to explore the South America they only knew from books.&lt;ref name="on_the_trail"&gt;[http://travel.nytimes.com/2004/12/19/travel/19che.html On the Trail of the Young Che Guevara] by Rachel Dodes, ''The New York Times'', December 19, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; During the formative odyssey Guevara is transformed by witnessing the social injustices of exploited mine workers, persecuted [[communists]], ostracized [[lepers]], and the tattered descendants of a once-great [[Inca civilization]]. By journey's end, they had travelled for a [[Childbirth|symbolic nine months]] by motorcycle, steamship, raft, horse, bus, and hitchhiking, covering more than {{convert|8000|km|miles}} across places such as the [[Andes]], [[Atacama Desert]], and the [[Amazon River Basin]]. The diary ends with a declaration by Guevara, born into an upper-middle-class family, displaying his willingness to fight and die for the cause of the poor, and his dream of seeing a united Latin America.

The book has been described as a classic [[coming-of-age]] story: a voyage of adventure and [[Journey of self-discovery|self-discovery]] that is both political and personal.&lt;ref name = "lettersNYT"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/26/world/letter-from-the-americas-che-today-more-easy-rider-than-revolutionary.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm Letter from the Americas; Che Today?

Ernesto Guevara spent long periods traveling around Latin America during his studies of medicine, beginning in 1948, at the [[University of Buenos Aires]]. In January 1950, Guevara attempted his first voyage. He traversed {{convert|4500|km|miles}} through the northern provinces of Argentina on a bicycle on which he installed a small engine. He arrived at San Francisco del Chañar, near [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]], where his friend Alberto Granado ran the dispensary of the leper-centre. This experience allowed Guevara to have long conversations with the patients about their disease.

This pre-expedition gave Guevara a taste of what would be experienced in his more extensive South American travels. The journey broke new ground for him in activities that would become central to his life: travelling and writing a diary.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Che: A Revolutionary Life|date=1997|publisher=Grove Press|isbn=0-8021-3558-7|edition=First Paperback|location=New York, New York, USA|last1=Anderson|first1=John Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|65}} His own father said that it was preparation for his subsequent long journeys across South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lynch|first1=Ernesto Guevara|editor1-last=De Toledo|editor1-first=Lucía Álvarez|title=Young Che: Memories of Che Guevara by his Father|date=2008|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York, New York, USA|isbn=978-0-307-39044-8|page=159|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guevara relied upon the hospitality of strangers that he encountered, as he and Granado would throughout their later travels. For example, following a puncture, he flagged down a lorry to take him to his next destination.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Story of Che Guevara|date=2010|publisher=HarperCollins Ltd|isbn=978-1-44340-566-9|edition=First Canadian|location=Toronto, Ontario, Canada|last1=De Toledo|first1=Lucía Álvarez}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|63}} In another instance, in [[Loreto, Santiago del Estero|Loreto]], he asked for hospitality from a local police officer when he had nowhere to stay.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|54}} The trip encouraged Guevara's style of traveling that would be seen in the Motorcycle Diaries.

It was the success of his Argentinian 'raid', as he so put it, that awakened in him a desire to explore the world and prompted the commencing of new travel plans.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|65}}

Upon completion of his bicycle journey, ''[[El Gráfico]]'', a sports magazine in Argentina, published a picture of Guevara on the motorbike he used for the journey. The company that manufactured the engine Ernesto adapted to his bicycle tried to use it for advertising claiming it was very strong since Guevara had gone on such a long tour using its power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.companeroche.com/index.php?id=40|title=the truth about Che Guevara: Adulthood|last=Hunt|first=Nigel|website=www.companeroche.com|language=en|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While he continued studying, he also worked as a nurse on trading and petroleum ships of the Argentine national shipping-company. This allowed Guevara to travel from the south of [[Argentina]] to [[Brazil]], [[Venezuela]] and [[Trinidad]].

{{quote|"This isn't a tale of derring-do, nor is it merely some kind of 'cynical account'; it isn't meant to be, at least. It's a chunk of two lives running parallel for a while, with common aspirations and similar dreams. In nine months a man can think a lot of thoughts, from the height of philosophical conjecture to the most abject longing for a bowl of soup – in perfect harmony with the state of his stomach. And if, at the same time, he's a bit of an adventurer, he could have experiences which might interest other people and his random account would read something like this diary."| Diary introduction}}

In January 1952 Guevara's older friend, [[Alberto Granado]], a biochemist, and Guevara, decided to take a year off from their medical studies to embark on a trip they had spoken of making for years: traversing South America on a motorcycle, which has metaphorically been compared to carbureted version of [[Don Quixote]]'s [[Rocinante]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/SB109597854336326564.htm Easy Revolutionary: Che Guevara Loves and Bikes In Fine 'Motorcycle Diaries'] by Joe Morgenstern, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', September 24, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Guevara and the 29-year-old Granado soon set off from [[Buenos Aires, Argentina]], astride a 1939 Norton 500 cc [[motorcycle]] they named ''La Poderosa II'' ("The Mighty II") with the idea of eventually spending a few weeks volunteering at the [[San Pablo, Peru|San Pablo]] Leper colony in [[Peru]] on the banks of the [[Amazon River]]. In total, the journey took Guevara through [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], [[Peru]], [[Ecuador]], [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]], [[Panama]], and to [[Miami]], before returning home to [[Buenos Aires]].

[[Image:Che Guevara-Granado - Mapa 1er viaje - 1952.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Map of Guevara's trip with [[Alberto Granado]]. The red arrows correspond to trips by airplane, the last two of which Guevara took alone]]

The trip was carried out in the face of some opposition by Guevara's parents, who knew that their son was both a severe [[asthmatic]] and a medical student close to completing his studies. However, Granado, himself a doctor, assuaged their concerns by guaranteeing that Guevara would return to finish his degree (which he ultimately did).&lt;ref name="Telegraph11"&gt;[http://www.ottawacitizen.com/story_print.html?id=4431515&amp;sponsor= He Rode with Che]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', March 13, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The first stop: Miramar, Argentina, a small resort where Guevara's girlfriend, Chichina, was spending the summer with her upper-class family. Two days stretched into eight, and upon leaving, Chichina gave Guevara a gold bracelet. The two men crossed into [[Chile]] on February 14. At one point they introduced themselves as internationally renowned leprosy experts to a local newspaper, which wrote a glowing story about them. The travelers later used the press clipping as a way to score meals and other favors with locals along the way.

{{quote|"We are looking for the bottom part of the town. We talk to many beggars. Our noses inhale attentively the misery."| Guevara's entry on [[Valparaíso, Chile]]}}

In reference to his experience in [[Chile]], Guevara also writes: "The most important effort that needs to be done is to get rid of the uncomfortable '[[Yankee]]-friend'. It is especially at this moment an immense task, because of the great amount of dollars they have invested here and the convenience of using economical pressure whenever they believe their interests are being threatened."

{{Quote box

There we understood that our vocation, our true vocation, was to move for eternity along the roads and seas of the world. Always curious, looking into everything that came before our eyes, sniffing out each corner but only very faintly – not setting down roots in any land or staying long enough to see the substratum of things; the outer limits would suffice."

Unable to get a boat to [[Easter Island]] as they intended, they headed north, where Guevara's political consciousness began to stir as he and Granado moved into mining country.&lt;ref name="Che Guevara 2005, pg 9"&gt;Che Guevara: Symbol of Struggle, by Tony Saunois, CWI, 2005, {{ISBN|1-870958-34-9}} pg 9&lt;/ref&gt; They visited [[Chuquicamata]] copper mine, the world's largest open-pit mine and the primary source of Chile's wealth. While getting a tour of the mine he asked how many men died in its creation. At the time it was run by U.S. mining monopolies of [[Anaconda Copper|Anaconda]] and [[Kennecott Utah Copper|Kennecott]] and thus was viewed by many as a symbol of "[[imperialist]] gringo domination".&lt;ref name="Che Guevara 2005, pg 9"/&gt; A meeting with a homeless [[communist]] couple in search of mining work made a particularly strong impression on Guevara, who wrote: "By the light of the single candle ... the contracted features of the worker gave off a mysterious and tragic air ... the couple, frozen stiff in the desert night, hugging one another, were a live representation of the [[proletariat]] of any part of the world,"

In reference to the oppression against the Communist party in Chile, which at the time was outlawed, Guevara said: "It's a great pity, that they repress people like this. Apart from whether [[collectivism]], the ‘communist vermin,’ is a danger to decent life, the [[communism]] gnawing at his entrails was no more than a natural longing for something better, a [[Class struggle|protest]] against persistent hunger transformed into a love for this [[Marxist theory|strange doctrine]], whose essence he could never grasp but whose translation, 'bread for the poor,' was something he understood and, more importantly, that filled him with hope. Needless to say, workers at [[Chuquicamata]] were in a living [[Hell]]."

{{rquote|right|The trip would not have been as useful and beneficial as it was, as a personal experience, if the motorcycle had held out. This gave us a chance to become familiar with the people.

In [[Peru]], Guevara was impressed by the old [[Inca civilization]], forced to ride in trucks with Indians and animals after ''"The Mighty One"'' broke down. As a result, he began to develop a fraternity with the indigenous [[Peasant|campesinos]]. In March 1952 they both arrived at the Peruvian [[Tacna]]. After a discussion about the [[poverty]] in the region, Guevara referred in his notes to the words of Cuban poet [[José Marti]]: "I want to link my destiny to that of the poor of this world." In May they arrived in [[Lima]], [[Peru]] and during this time Guevara met doctor [[Hugo Pesce]], a Peruvian scientist, director of the national leprosy program, and an important local Marxist. They discussed several nights until the early morning and years later Che identified these conversations as being very important for his evolution in attitude towards life and society.

In May, Guevara and Granado left for the [[leper colony]] of San Pablo in the Peruvian [[Amazon Rainforest]], arriving there in June. During his stay Guevara complained about the miserable way the people and sick of that region had to live. Guevara also swam once from the side of the [[Amazon River]] where the doctors stayed, to the other side of the river where the [[leper]] patients lived, a considerable distance of {{convert|4|km|miles}}. He describes how there were no clothes, almost no food, and no medication. However, Guevara was moved by his time with the [[lepers]], remarking that

{{quote|"All the love and caring just consist on coming to them without gloves and medical attire, shaking their hands as any other neighbor and sitting together for a chat about anything or playing football with them."&lt;ref name = "A1950"&gt;[http://www.companeroche.com/index.php?id=40 Ernesto Che Guevara: 1950-1953]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:CheOnRaft1952.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Guevara (right) with [[Alberto Granado]] (left) aboard their "Mambo-Tango" wooden raft on the [[Amazon River]] in June 1952. The raft was a gift from the [[lepers]] whom they had treated]]

After giving consultations and treating patients for a few weeks, Guevara and Granado left aboard the Mambo-Tango raft (shown) for [[Leticia, Colombia]] via the [[Amazon River]].

While visiting [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]], he wrote a letter to his mother on July 6, 1952. In the letter he described the conditions under the [[right-wing]] government of [[Conservative]] [[Laureano Gómez]] as the following: "There is more repression of individual freedom here than in any country we've been to, the police patrol the streets carrying rifles and demand your papers every few minutes". He also goes on to describe the atmosphere as "tense" and "suffocating" even hypothesizing that "a revolution may be brewing". Guevara was correct in his prognostication, as a military [[coup]] in 1953 would take place, bringing General [[Gustavo Rojas Pinilla|Gustavo Rojas]] to power.

Later that month Guevara arrived in [[Caracas]], Venezuela and from there decided to return to [[Buenos Aires]] to finish his studies in medical science. However, prior to his return, he travelled by cargo plane to [[Miami]], where the airplane's technical problems delayed him one month. To survive, he worked as a waiter and washed dishes in a Miami bar.

Although he admitted throughout that as a [[vagabond (person)|vagabond]] traveler he could only see things at surface level, he did attempt to delve beneath the sheen of the places he visited. On one occasion he went to see a woman dying of tuberculosis, leaving appalled by the failings of the public health system. This experience led him to ruminate the following reflection: "How long this present order, based on the absurd idea of caste, will last is not within my means to answer, but it's time that those who govern spent less time publicizing their own virtues and more money, much more money, funding socially useful works."

{{quote|"It is at times like this, when a doctor is conscious of his complete powerlessness, that he longs for change: a change to prevent the injustice of a system in which only a month ago this poor woman was still earning her living as a waitress, wheezing and panting but facing life with dignity. In circumstances like this, individuals in poor families who can’t pay their way become surrounded by an atmosphere of barely disguised acrimony; they stop being father, mother, sister or brother and become a purely negative factor in the struggle for life and, consequently, a source of bitterness for the healthy members of the community who resent their illness as if it were a personal insult to those who have to support them."| Guevara while treating a peasant woman dying of [[tuberculosis]]}}

Witnessing the widespread endemic [[poverty]], [[oppression]] and [[disenfranchisement]] throughout Latin America, and influenced by his readings of Marxist literature, Guevara later decided that the only solution for the region's [[Social structure|structural]] inequalities was armed [[revolution]]. His travels and readings throughout this journey  also led him to view Latin America not as a group of separate nations, but as a single entity requiring a continent-wide strategy for [[Liberty|liberation]] from what he viewed as [[Imperialism|imperialist]] and [[neo-colonialism|neo-colonial]] domination. His conception of a borderless, united, Hispanic-America sharing a common '[[mestizo]]' bond, was a theme that would prominently recur during his later activities and transformation from Ernesto the traveler, into [[Che Guevara]] the iconic revolutionary.

==Transformation==

{{quote|I knew that when the great guiding spirit cleaves humanity into two antagonistic halves, I will be with the people.| Guevara's conclusion}}

Although it is considered to be formative, scholars have largely ignored this period of Guevara's life.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Che's Travels: The Making of a Revolutionary in 1950s Latin America|date=2010|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0822391805|location=Durham [NC]|last1=Drinot|first1=Paulo}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|2}} However, historians and biographers now agree that the experience had a profound impact on Guevara, who later became one of the most famous [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] leaders in history. "His political and social awakening has very much to do with this face-to-face contact with poverty, exploitation, illness, and suffering", said Carlos M. Vilas, a history professor at the Universidad Nacional de Lanús in Buenos Aires, Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/10/1014_041014_motorcycle_diaries.html|title="Motorcycle Diaries" Shows Che Guevara at Crossroads|website=news.nationalgeographic.com|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2005, [[Alberto Granado]] described their journey to the [[BBC]], stating: "The most important thing was to realise that we had a common sensibility for the things that were wrong and unjust." According to Granado, their time at the [[leper colony]] of San Pablo in the [[Amazon River|Amazon]] also proved pivotal. Recalling that they shared everything with the sick people and describing Guevara's wave on departure as follows: "I got the impression that Che was saying goodbye to institutional medicine and becoming a doctor of the people."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4518213.stm|title='My best friend Che'|date=2005-05-09|newspaper=BBC|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Granado later observed that by the end of their journey, "We were just a pair of [[Vagabond (person)|vagabonds]] with knapsacks on our backs, the dust of the road covering us, mere shadows of our old [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] egos."&lt;ref name = "lettersNYT" /&gt;

According to his daughter [[Aleida Guevara]] in a 2004 article, throughout the book we can see how Guevara became aware that what poor people needed was not his scientific knowledge as a doctor, but his strength and persistence to bring social change.&lt;ref name="aleida"&gt;{{cite news |title=Riding My Father's Motorcycle |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/09/opinion/09guevara.html?_r=2&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=motorcycle+diaries&amp;st=nyt&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin |author=Aleida Guevara |date=2008-10-09|accessdate=2008-04-08 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

Guevara's experience of the South American continent also helped to shape his revolutionary sensibilities. When discussing the plight of the downtrodden Indians of Peru, Granado discussed the formation of an Indian political party to begin a [[Túpac Amaru]] Indian Revolution. Guevara allegedly replied "Revolution without firing a shot? You're crazy?'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=De Toledo|first1=Lucía Álvarez|title=The Story of Che Guevara|date=2010|publisher=HarperCollins Ltd|location=Toronto, Ontario, Canada|isbn=978-1-44340-566-9|page=86|edition=First Canadian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journey was also formative in his political beliefs, for example historian Paulo Drinot notes that the journey stimulated his sentiments of [[Pan-Americanism]] that would later shape his revolutionary behaviors.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{Rp|8}}

Scholar Lucía Álvarez De Toledo argues that it was on these motorcycle travels that he "disregarded his social class and his white European racial ancestry" and retained the view of himself as an Argentine, as a member of the United America he had encountered during his travels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=De Toledo|first1=Lucía Álvarez|title=The Story of Che Guevara|date=2010|publisher=HarperCollins Ltd|location=Toronto, Ontario, Canada|isbn=978-1-44340-566-9|page=93|edition=First Canadian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having said this, with the exception of Guatemala, Guevara showed little concern with the policies of the countries he encountered.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{Rp|4}} In total however, Guevara's travels in the 1950s played an important role in determining his view on the world "and his later revolutionary trajectory."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{Rp|17}}

==Editions==
In 2004, Che Guevara's daughter, [[Aleida Guevara]], explained that her father had not intended his diary to be published, and that it had the state of "a sheaf of typewritten pages". But already in the 1980s, his family worked on his unpublished manuscripts, and a Cuban publishing house brought out ''The Motorcycle Diaries'' for the first time in 1993.&lt;ref name="aleida" /&gt;

The director of Ocean Press insists that the book had been legally published in Cuba and that any rumors of a conspiracy to prohibit its publication there are false. He also points out that the Union of Young Communists brought out an edition, with another to be published by the Che Guevara Studies Center.  Furthermore, he has given an assurance that its publication has the support of many people including [[Fidel Castro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9505E5DA1731F931A35755C0A9629C8B63&amp;scp=3&amp;sq=motorcycle+diaries&amp;st=nyt|title=Che Guevara's Diaries (letter to the editor|author1=David Deutschmann |author2=Publisher and President |author3=Ocean Press) |publisher=New York Times|date=2008-06-02|accessdate=2008-04-08}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Motorcycle Diaries:  Notes on a Latin American Journey'' was published by Ocean Press and the Che Guevara Studies Center, Havana, in 2003.  The book has a preface by Aleida Guevara March and an introduction by Cintio Vitier.  This edition is edited and translated by Alexandra Keeble.

===Editing===
Some observers have questioned the full veracity of the work based on its editing. Michael Casey wrote that, "''Diaries'' is not a diary at all but rather a deliberately constructed memoir that the young Ernesto fashioned and embellished."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Casey|first1=Michael|title=Che's Afterlife: The Legacy of an Image|date=April 2009|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York, New York, USA|isbn=978-0-307-27930-9|page=52|edition=A Vintage Books Original}}&lt;/ref&gt; Casey argues that revisions such as these cause Guevara to blur the line between fiction and nonfiction in his writings.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Other scholars have taken this claim even further. Frans Weiser argues that Guevara was not the only person that was editing and reshaping his notes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weiser|first1=Frans|title=Writing "Che" Writing: Apocryphal Diaries and the Deconstruction of Guevara's Myth|journal=Hispania|date=4 December 2013|volume=96|issue=4|page=703|doi=10.1353/hpn.2013.0126|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/article/531376/pdf|accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Paulo Drinot contends that the Cuban government, as well as others, reworked the texts for self-fashioning or political benefits.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However, Drinot also points out that Guevara's introduction explicitly mentions how the notes are "reorganized" and "polished", and that such a practicality should in no way undermine its utility as a historical source.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{Rp|8}}

==Review==
{{Quote|"Guevara's youthful Motorcycle Diaries is rebellious in ways that are not immediately obvious. This travelogue shows Ernesto the Medical Student developing a sense of Pan-Latin Americanism that fuses the interests of indigenous Andean peasants with traditional adversaries like upper-middle-class Argentine intellectuals (i.e. Guevara). The book ventures a unified regional opposition to U.S. hegemony and global capitalism's sometimes ravaging effects on Latin America."| [[World Hum]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldhum.com/features/travel-books/nine-subversive-travel-books-non-fiction-20091109/ Nine Subversive Travel Books] by Thomas Kohnstamm, ''[[World Hum]]'', January 12, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''The Oxford Imps''' are an [[improvisational comedy]] troupe based in [[Oxford]], England, where they perform every Monday during University term time at The Wheatsheaf pub. They also perform annually at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe|Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] at the [[Gilded Balloon]].

They were reviewed as "the best improvised comedy show I have ever had the pleasure to witness" by [[Edinburgh Fringe]] festival magazine ''[[ThreeWeeks]]'' and as "astonishingly brilliant" by Cue 2016, the official paper of the [[Grahamstown Festival|Grahamstown]] National Arts Festival.

== History==

'''''Unir Cinéma: Revue du Cinéma Africain''''' was the first periodical entirely devoted to African cinema to come out of Francophone Africa. Its impact established it as an essential reference tool on cinema on the continent.

==Publishing==
First published in 1973, this [[Senegalese]] film magazine was typewritten and duplicated through offset printing. Written by both Senegalese and French reviewers and published by the Catholic Information Center of the diocese of Saint Louis, it provided up to date filmographies of recent motion pictures as well as more detailed entries (including credits, filmmakers' biographies, film summaries and critiques) of the most significant cinematographic works by African filmmakers.

==Content and Themes==
Its detailed reports on [[film festivals]] throughout the world revealed the exposure and appreciation of [[African cinema]] on an international level, while its listings of places where African films have been or will be commercially exhibited attested to the scope of their circulation. Carefully prepared by-country dossiers revealed both the status of cinema in different regions and the efforts undertaken by local governments to promote the production and distribution of their films. While little effort was made to offer more in-depth critical insights into the thematics, aesthetics and ethics of African cinema, Unir Cinéma did furnish its readers with bibliographies of the latest articles on African cinema in international magazines and journals as well as the names of international periodicals with a serious interest in the critique of African films.

==Ending==
First edited by Pere Jean Vast on tight budget in 1973 until 1996, later by Pere Joseph Lambrecht (1998–2000).

==Notes==
* Unir Cinéma was initially (from no. 1 to 35) a general periodical titled Unir (L'Echo de Saint-Louis). In 1973 it switched focus exclusively to film and continued as Unir Cinema: Revue Du Cinéma Africain.
* Ecrans d'Afrique (Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, 1992)
* Les 2 Ecrans: revue mensuelle de cinéma et de television (Zirout, Algiers, Algeria)
