On the morning of '''June 27, 2015''', heavy [[rain]] occurred in a great portion of the [[Scouting]] reserve '''[[Philmont Scout Ranch]]''', which is near [[Cimarron, New Mexico|Cimarron]], [[New Mexico]], [[United States]], causing a '''[[flash flood]]'''. The flood also affected some other nearby areas in [[Colfax County, New Mexico|Colfax County]] that morning, including [[highway]]s and small towns around Philmont. One youth [[Scout (Scouting)|Scout]], Alden Brock, who was situated in a campsite within the staff camp Indian Writings, drowned while being swept away by the flood and died. The flood also had a significant impact on many individual crews and treks and significantly damaged some campsites. The 2015 flash flood is the largest documented flood in the history of Philmont, and is the only flood at Philmont that has ever caused the death of a person.

==Background==
Throughout much of the summer of 2015, parts of New Mexico were experiencing a [[Wet season|monsoon season]], likely due to an [[El Niño]].&lt;ref name="farmers"&gt;{{cite web | title = Wet summer means safer forests, happier farmers, ferocious pests |publisher=''[[Santa Fe New Mexican]]''|last=Matlock|first=Staci|date= 18 July 2015| url = http://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/wet-summer-means-safer-forests-happier-farmers-ferocious-pests/article_8891132d-9ea0-5de2-b2e0-f80a0da2048b.html | accessdate = 2016-01-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PhilNews"&gt;{{cite web | title = The flood of ‘15: Philmont comes together |publisher=PhilNews|last=|first=|date= 24 July 2015| url = http://www.philmontscoutranch.org/filestore/philmont/pdf/Philnews_2015/2015PhilNews_7.pdf | accessdate = 2016-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PhilNews"&gt;{{cite web | title = The flood of ‘15: Philmont comes together |publisher=PhilNews|last=|first=|date= 24 July 2015| url = http://www.philmontscoutranch.org/filestore/philmont/pdf/Philnews_2015/2015PhilNews_7.pdf | accessdate = 2016-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the season, there had been many other flash flood warnings across New Mexico due to large storms.&lt;ref name="more"&gt;{{cite web | title = More storms forecast after city pounded by hail, rain |publisher=''[[Santa Fe New Mexican]]''|last=Nott|first=Robert|date= 8 July 2015| url = http://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/more-storms-forecast-after-city-pounded-by-hail-rain/article_a0915728-5598-51eb-8f36-ae6665df2fa0.html | accessdate = 2016-01-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="farmers"&gt;{{cite web | title = Wet summer means safer forests, happier farmers, ferocious pests |publisher=''[[Santa Fe New Mexican]]''|last=Matlock|first=Staci|date= 18 July 2015| url = http://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/wet-summer-means-safer-forests-happier-farmers-ferocious-pests/article_8891132d-9ea0-5de2-b2e0-f80a0da2048b.html | accessdate = 2016-01-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fifty years before the 2015 flood, on June 17, 1965, [[1965 Philmont Scout Ranch flash flood|a similar flash flood]] had occurred at Philmont Scout Ranch.

Crews affected by the flood were given the opportunity to choose whether they were to continue their treks or to leave Philmont.

'''Acute radiation syndrome''' ('''ARS''') is a collection of health effects that are present within 24 hours of exposure to high [[absorbed dose|doses]] of [[ionizing radiation]]. It is also called '''radiation poisoning''', '''radiation sickness''' and '''radiation toxicity'''.

The onset and type of symptoms depend on the amount of radiation exposure, both in any one dose, and cumulative exposure. Relatively smaller doses result in [[gastrointestinal]] effects, such as nausea and vomiting, and symptoms related to falling blood counts, and predisposition to infection and bleeding. Relatively larger doses can result in neurological effects, including but not limited to seizures, tremors, lethargy, and rapid death.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Treatment of acute radiation syndrome is generally supportive with [[blood transfusions]] and [[antibiotics]], with some extreme cases requiring more aggressive treatments, such as bone marrow transfusions.&lt;ref name="Review10" /&gt;

The radiation  causes [[Autophagy|cellular degradation]] due to damage to [[DNA]] and other key molecular structures within the cells in various tissues. This destruction, particularly because it affects the ability of cells to divide normally, in turn causes the symptoms. The symptoms can begin within one hour and may last for several months.&lt;ref name=Review10&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Donnelly EH, Nemhauser JB, Smith JM |title=Acute radiation syndrome: assessment and management |journal=South.

==Signs and symptoms==
{{See also|Signs and symptoms of radiation poisoning}}
[[File:Radiation Sickness.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Radiation sickness]]
Classically acute radiation syndrome is divided into three main presentations: [[Haematopoiesis|hematopoietic]], [[gastrointestinal]], and [[neurological]]/[[vascular]]. These syndromes may or may not be preceded by a [[prodrome]].&lt;ref name=Review10/&gt; The speed of onset of symptoms is related to radiation exposure, with greater doses resulting in a shorter delay in symptom onset.&lt;ref name=Review10/&gt; These presentations presume whole-body exposure and many of them are markers which are not valid if the entire body has not been exposed. Each syndrome requires that the tissue showing the syndrome itself be exposed. The hematopoietic syndrome requires exposure of the areas of bone marrow actively forming blood elements (i.e., the pelvis and sternum in adults). The neurovascular symptoms require exposure of the brain. The gastrointestinal syndrome is not seen if the stomach and intestines are not exposed to radiation. Some areas affected are:{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

#Hematopoietic. This syndrome is marked by a drop in the number of [[blood cells]], called [[aplastic anemia]]. This may result in infections due to a low amount of [[white blood cells]], bleeding due to a lack of [[platelets]], and [[anemia]] due to too few [[red blood cells]] in the circulation.&lt;ref name=Review10/&gt; These changes can be detected by blood tests after receiving a whole-body acute dose as low as {{convert|0.25|Gy|rad|lk=on}}, though they might never be felt by the patient if the dose is below {{convert|1|Gy|rad}}. Conventional trauma and burns resulting from a bomb blast are complicated by the poor wound healing caused by hematopoietic syndrome, increasing mortality. 
#Gastrointestinal. This syndrome often follows absorbed doses of {{convert|6|-|30|Gy|rad}}.&lt;ref name=Review10/&gt; The signs and symptoms of this form of radiation injury include [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[anorexia (symptom)|loss of appetite]], and [[abdominal pain]].&lt;ref name="Christensen2014"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Christensen DM, Iddins CJ, Sugarman SL |title=Ionizing radiation injuries and illnesses|date=February 2014|journal=Emerg Med Clin North Am|volume=32|issue=1|pages=245–65|pmid=24275177|doi=10.1016/j.emc.2013.10.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vomiting in this time-frame is a marker for whole body exposures that are in the fatal range above {{convert|4|Gy|rad}}. Without exotic treatment such as bone marrow transplant, death with this dose is common.&lt;ref name=Review10/&gt; The death is generally more due to infection than gastrointestinal dysfunction.
#Neurovascular. This syndrome typically occurs at absorbed doses greater than {{convert|30|Gy|rad}}, though it may occur at {{convert|10|Gy|rad}}.&lt;ref name=Review10/&gt; It presents with neurological symptoms such as [[dizziness]], [[headache]], or [[decreased level of consciousness]], occurring within minutes to a few hours, and with an absence of vomiting. It is invariably fatal.&lt;ref name=Review10/&gt;

The prodrome (early symptoms) of ARS typically includes [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]], [[headache]]s, fatigue, [[fever]], and a short period of [[Erythema|skin reddening]].&lt;ref name=Review10/&gt; These symptoms may occur at radiation doses as low as {{convert|0.35|Gy|rad}}. These symptoms are common to many illnesses, and may not, by themselves, indicate acute radiation sickness.&lt;ref name=Review10/&gt;

===Whole-body absorbed dose effect===
{{Whole-body absorbed dose symptom}}

===Skin changes===
{{main|radiation burn}}

[[List of cutaneous conditions#Ionizing radiation-induced|Cutaneous radiation syndrome]] (CRS) refers to the skin symptoms of radiation exposure.&lt;ref name="arsphysicianfactsheet" /&gt; Within a few hours after irradiation, a transient and inconsistent [[erythema|redness]] (associated with [[itch]]ing) can occur. Then, a latent phase may occur and last from a few days up to several weeks, when intense reddening, [[blister]]ing, and [[Ulcer (dermatology)|ulceration]] of the irradiated site are visible. In most cases, healing occurs by regenerative means; however, very large skin doses can cause permanent hair loss, damaged [[Sebaceous gland|sebaceous]] and [[sweat gland]]s, [[atrophy]], [[fibrosis]] (mostly [[keloids]]), decreased or increased skin pigmentation, and ulceration or [[necrosis]] of the exposed tissue.&lt;ref name="arsphysicianfactsheet" /&gt; Notably, as seen at [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]], when skin is irradiated with high energy [[beta particles]], moist [[desquamation]] (peeling of skin) and similar early effects can heal, only to be followed by the collapse of the dermal vascular system after two months, resulting in the loss of the full thickness of the exposed skin.&lt;ref&gt;The medical handling of skin lesions following high level accidental irradiation, IAEA Advisory Group Meeting, September 1987 Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; This effect had been demonstrated previously with pig skin using high energy beta sources at the Churchill Hospital Research Institute, in [[Oxford, England|Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Wells J |contribution=Non-Uniform Irrradiation of Skin: Criteria for limiting non-stochastic effects |title=Proceedings of the Third International Symposium of the Society for Radiological Protection |series=Advances in Theory and Practice |isbn=0-9508123-0-7 |volume=2 |pages=537–542 |year=1982 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cancer===
{{main|radiation-induced cancer}}
According to the [[linear no-threshold model]], any exposure to ionizing radiation, even at doses too low to produce any symptoms of radiation sickness, can induce cancer due to cellular and genetic damage. Under the assumption, survivors of acute radiation syndrome face an increased risk of developing cancer later in life. The probability of developing cancer is a linear function with respect to the [[effective radiation dose]]. In radiation-induced cancer, the speed at which the condition advances, the [[prognosis]], the degree of pain, and every other feature of the disease are not believed to be functions of the radiation dosage.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

However, [[Linear no-threshold model#Controversy|some studies]] contradict the linear no-threshold model. These studies indicate that some low levels of radiation do not increase cancer risk at all, and that there may exist a threshold dosage of ionizing radiation below which exposure should be considered safe. Nonetheless the 'no safe amount' assumption is the basis of US and most national regulatory policies regarding "man-made" sources of radiation.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==Cause==
[[File:Death by haematopoietic syndrome of radiation sickness- influence of dose rate.png|thumb|300px|Both dose and dose rate contribute to the severity of acute radiation syndrome. The effects of [[dose fractionation]] or rest periods before repeated exposure, also shifts the [[LD50]] dose, upwards.]]
Radiation sickness is caused by exposure to a large dose of ionizing radiation (&gt;&amp;nbsp;~0.1&amp;nbsp;Gy) over a short period of time. (&gt;&amp;nbsp;~0.1&amp;nbsp;Gy/h) This might be the result of a [[nuclear explosion]], a [[criticality accident]], a [[radiotherapy]] accident as in [[Therac-25]], a [[solar flare]] during interplanetary travel, misplacement of radioactive waste as in the 1987 [[Goiânia accident]], human error in a nuclear reactor, or other possibilities. Acute radiation sickness due to ingestion of radioactive material is possible, but rare; examples include the 1987 contamination of [[Leide das Neves Ferreira]] and the 2006 [[poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} &lt;!--People who don't belong here: There were other ARS cases in the Goiânia accident, but not from ingestion. Eben Byers died of radiation-induced cancer in 1932, but his dose rate was too low to cause acute radiation syndrome. Byers may have experienced [[chronic radiation syndrome]], but that would be OR.--&gt;

Alpha and beta radiation have low penetrating power and are unlikely to affect vital internal organs from outside the body. Any type of ionizing radiation can cause burns, but alpha and beta radiation can only do so if [[radioactive contamination]] or [[nuclear fallout]] is deposited on the individual's skin or clothing. Gamma and neutron radiation can travel much further distances and penetrate the body easily, so whole-body irradiation generally causes ARS before skin effects are evident. Local gamma irradiation can cause skin effects without any sickness. In the early twentieth century, radiographers would commonly calibrate their machines by irradiating their own hands and measuring the time to onset of [[erythema]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=William C.

===Spaceflight===
During spaceflight, particularly flights beyond [[low Earth orbit]], astronauts are exposed to both [[galactic cosmic ray|galactic cosmic radiation]] (GCR) and [[Solar proton event|solar particle event]] (SPE) radiation.  Evidence indicates past SPE radiation levels which would have been lethal for unprotected astronauts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7142 |title=Superflares could kill unprotected astronauts |publisher=New Scientist |date=21 March 2005 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150327023245/http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7142 |archivedate=27 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; GCR levels which might lead to acute radiation poisoning are less well understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=National Research Council (U.S.).

==Pathophysiology==
The most commonly used predictor of acute radiation symptoms is the whole-body [[absorbed dose]]. Several related quantities, such as the [[equivalent dose]], [[effective dose (radiation)|effective dose]], and [[committed dose]], are used to gauge long-term stochastic biological effects such as cancer incidence, but they are not designed to evaluate acute radiation syndrome.&lt;ref name="ICRP103"&gt;{{cite journa l|title=The 2007 Recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection |journal=Annals of the ICRP |year=2007 |volume=37 |series=ICRP publication 103 |issue=2–4 |url=http://www.icrp.org/publication.asp?id=ICRP%20Publication%20103 |accessdate=17 May 2012 |isbn=978-0-7020-3048-2 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116084754/http://www.icrp.org/publication.asp?id=ICRP+Publication+103 |archivedate=16 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To help avoid confusion between these quantities, absorbed dose is measured in units of [[gray (unit)|grays]] (in [[SI]], unit symbol '''Gy''') or [[rad (unit)|rads]] (in [[CGS]]), while the others are measured in [[sievert (unit)|sieverts]] (in SI, unit symbol '''Sv''') or [[rem (unit)|rems]] (in CGS). 1&amp;nbsp;rad = 0.01&amp;nbsp;Gy and 1&amp;nbsp;rem = 0.01&amp;nbsp;Sv.&lt;ref name="remdefinition"&gt;{{cite work |title=The Effects of Nuclear Weapons |edition=Revised |publisher=US Department of Defense |year=1962 |page=579}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most of the acute exposure scenarios that lead to radiation sickness, the bulk of the radiation is external whole-body gamma, in which case the absorbed, equivalent and effective doses are all equal. There are exceptions, such as the [[Therac-25]] accidents and the 1958 [[Cecil Kelley criticality accident]], where the absorbed doses in Gy or rad are the only useful quantities.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

[[Radiotherapy]] treatments are typically prescribed in terms of the local absorbed dose, which might be 60&amp;nbsp;Gy or higher. The dose is fractionated (about 2&amp;nbsp;Gy per day for curative treatment), which allows for the normal tissues to undergo [[DNA repair|repair]], allowing it to tolerate a higher dose than would otherwise be expected.  The dose to the targeted tissue mass must be averaged over the entire body mass, most of which receives negligible radiation, to arrive at a whole-body absorbed dose that can be compared to the table above.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

===DNA damage===

High radiation doses can cause [[DNA]] damage.  If left unrepaired, this damage can create serious and even lethal chromosomal aberrations.  Ionizing radiation can produce [[reactive oxygen species]], which are very damaging to DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Yu Y |author2=Cui Y |author3=Niedernhofer L |author4=Wang Y |title=Occurrence, biological consequences and human health relevance of oxidative stress-induced DNA damage |journal=Chemical Research in Toxicology |volume=29 |pages=2008–2039 |year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ionizing radiation does direct damage to cells by causing localized ionization events, creating clusters of DNA damage.&lt;ref name="Eccles L. 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Eccles L. |author2=O’Neill P. |author3=Lomax M. |title=Delayed repair of radiation induced DNA damage: Friend or foe? |journal=Mutation Research |volume=711 |pages=134–141 |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This damage includes loss of [[nucleobases]] and breakage of the sugar-phosphate backbone that binds to the nucleobases.  Breakages can happen to one or both of the backbone strands.  Single-stranded breakages are easier to repair than double-stranded breakages, because there is still an unbroken complementary strand to use as a template.  The DNA organization at the level of [[histones]], nucleosomes, and [[chromatin]] also affects its susceptibility to radiation damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lavelle C. |author2=Foray N. |title=Chromatin structure and radiation-induced DNA damage: From structural biology to radiobiology |journal=International Journal of Biochemistry &amp; Cell Biology |volume=49 |pages=84–97 |year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clustered damage, defined as at least two lesions within a helical turn, is especially harmful.&lt;ref name="Eccles L. 2011"/&gt; While DNA damage happens frequently and naturally in the cell from endogenous sources, clustered damage is a unique effect of radiation exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Goodhead D. |title=Initial events in the cellular effects of ionizing radiations: Clustered damage in DNA |journal=International Journal of Radiation Biology |volume=65 |pages=7–17 |year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Clustered damage takes longer to repair than isolated breakages, and is less likely to be repaired at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Georgakilas A. |author2=Bennett P. |author3=Wilson D. |author4=Sutherland B. |title=Processing of bistranded abasic DNA clusters in gamma-irradiated human hematopoietic cells |journal=Nucleic Acids Research |volume=32 |pages=5609–5620 |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larger radiation doses are more prone to cause tighter clustering of damage, and closely localized damage is increasingly less likely to be repaired.&lt;ref name="Eccles L. 2011"/&gt;

Somatic mutations cannot be passed down from parent to offspring, but these mutations can propagate in cell lines within an organism.  Radiation damage can also cause chromosome and chromatid aberrations, and their effect depends on what stage of the mitotic cycle the cell is currently in when the irradiation occurs. If the cell is in interphase, while it is still a single strand of chromatin, the damage will be replicated during the S1 phase of [[cell cycle]], and there will be a break on both chromosome arms.  Then the damage will be apparent in both daughter cells.  If the irradiation occurs after replication, only one arm will bear the damage. This damage will only be apparent in one daughter cell.  A damaged chromosome may cyclize, binding to another chromosome, or to itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Hall E. |author2=Giaccia A. |title=Radiobiology for the Radiobiologist |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |edition=Sixth |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is typically made based on a history of significant radiation exposure and suitable clinical findings.&lt;ref name=Review10/&gt; An [[Complete blood count|absolute lymphocyte count]] can give a rough estimate of radiation exposure.&lt;ref name=Review10/&gt; Time from exposure to vomiting can also give estimates of exposure levels if they are less than 1000&amp;nbsp;rad.&lt;ref name=Review10/&gt;

==Prevention==
{{See also|Radiation protection}}

===Time===
The longer that humans are subjected to radiation the larger the dose will be. The advice in the [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] manual entitled "[[Nuclear War Survival Skills]]" published by [[Cresson Kearny]] in the [[United States|U.S.]] was that if one needed to leave the shelter then this should be done as rapidly as possible to minimize exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kearny |first=Cresson H. |authorlink=Cresson Kearny |title=Nuclear War Survival Skills |url=http://oism.org/nwss/ |year=1988 |publisher=Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine |isbn=0-942487-01-X |ref=harv |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171017183044/http://www.oism.org/nwss/ |archivedate=2017-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In chapter 12, he states that "''[q]uickly putting or dumping wastes outside is not hazardous once fallout is no longer being deposited. For example, assume the shelter is in an area of heavy fallout and the dose rate outside is 400 [[Roentgen (unit)|roentgen (R)]] per hour, enough to give a potentially fatal dose in about an hour to a person exposed in the open. If a person needs to be exposed for only 10 seconds to dump a bucket, in this 1/360 of an hour he will receive a dose of only about 1 R. Under war conditions, an additional 1-R dose is of little concern.''" In peacetime, radiation workers are taught to work as quickly as possible when performing a task which exposes them to radiation. For instance, the recovery of a radioactive source should be done as quickly as possible.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

===Distance===
Increasing distance from the radiation source reduces the dose according to the [[inverse-square law]] for a point source.  Distance can sometimes be effectively increased by means as simple as handling a source with [[forceps]] rather than fingers. This could reduce [[erythema]] to the fingers, but the extra few centimeters distance from the body will give little protection from acute radiation syndrome.
{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

===Shielding===
Matter attenuates radiation in most cases, so placing any mass (e.g., lead, dirt, sandbags, vehicles) between humans and the source will reduce the radiation dose. This is not always the case, however; care should be taken when constructing shielding for a specific purpose. For example, although high atomic number materials are very effective in shielding [[photon]]s, using them to shield [[beta particle]]s may cause higher radiation exposure due to the production of [[bremsstrahlung]] x-rays, and hence low atomic number materials are recommended. Also, using material with a high [[neutron activation]] [[cross section (physics)|cross section]] to shield neutrons will result in the shielding material itself becoming radioactive and hence more dangerous than if it were not present.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

There are many types of shielding strategies which can be used to reduce the effects of radiation exposure. Internal contamination protective equipment such as respirators are used to prevent internal deposition as a result of inhalation and ingestion of radioactive material. Dermal protective equipment, which protects against external contamination, provides shielding to prevent radioactive material from being deposited on external structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.remm.nlm.gov/radiation_ppe.htm|title=Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) in a Radiation Emergency - Radiation Emergency Medical Management|website=www.remm.nlm.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; While these protective measures do provide a barrier from radioactive material deposition, they do not shield from externally penetrating gamma radiation. This leaves anyone exposed to penetrating gamma rays at high risk of Acute Radiation Syndrome.

Naturally, shielding the entire body from high energy gamma radiation is optimal, but the required mass to provide adequate attenuation makes functional movement nearly impossible. In the event of a radiation catastrophe, medical and security personnel need [[Radiation protection#Externally Penetrating Radiation Protective Equipment|mobile protection equipment]] in order to safely assist in containment, evacuation, and many other necessary public safety objectives.

Research has been done exploring the feasibility of partial body shielding, a radiation protection strategy which provides adequate attenuation to only the most radio-sensitive organs and tissues inside the body. Irreversible stem cell damage in the bone marrow is the first life-threatening effect of intense radiation exposure and therefore one of the most important bodily elements to protect.  Due to the regenerative property of [[hematopoietic stem cell]]s, it is only necessary to protect enough bone marrow to repopulate the exposed areas of the body with the shielded supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waterman|first=Gideon|last2=Kase|first2=Kenneth|last3=Orion|first3=Itzhak|last4=Broisman|first4=Andrey|last5=Milstein|first5=Oren|date=September 2017|title=Selective Shielding of Bone Marrow|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/hp.0000000000000688|journal=Health Physics|volume=113|issue=3|pages=195–208|doi=10.1097/hp.0000000000000688|issn=0017-9078}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept allows for the development of  lightweight [[Radiation protection#Externally Penetrating Radiation Protective Equipment|mobile radiation protection equipment]], which provides adequate protection, deferring the onset of Acute Radiation Syndrome to much higher exposure doses. One example of such equipment is the [[StemRad#Technology|360 gamma]], a radiation protection belt which applies selective shielding to protect the bone marrow stored in the pelvic area as well as other radio sensitive organs in the abdominal region without hindering functional mobility.

More information on bone marrow shielding can be found in the [https://journals.lww.com/health-physics/pages/default.aspx Health Physics Radiation Safety Journal] article [https://journals.lww.com/health-physics/Abstract/2017/09000/Selective_Shielding_of_Bone_Marrow___An_Approach.4.aspx Selective Shielding of Bone Marrow: An Approach to Protecting Humans from External Gamma Radiation], or in the [[OECD|Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)]] and the [[Nuclear Energy Agency|Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA)]]'s 2015 report: [https://www.oecd-nea.org/rp/docs/2014/crpph-r2014-5.pdf Occupational Radiation Protection in Severe Accident Management].

===Reduction of incorporation===
Where [[radioactive contamination]] is present, a [[gas mask]], dust mask, or good hygiene practices may offer protection, depending on the nature of the contaminant. [[Potassium iodide]] (KI) tablets can reduce the risk of cancer in some situations due to slower uptake of ambient radioiodine. Although this does not protect any organ other than the thyroid gland, their effectiveness is still highly dependent on the time of ingestion which would protect the gland for the duration of a twenty-four-hour period. They do not prevent acute radiation syndrome as they provide no shielding from other environmental radionuclides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Radiation and its Health Effects |url=https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/radiation/rad-health-effects.html |publisher=Nuclear Regulatory Commission |accessdate=2013-11-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014200532/http://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/radiation/rad-health-effects.html |archivedate=2013-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fractionation of dose===
{{main|dose fractionation}}
If an intentional dose is broken up into a number of smaller doses, with time allowed for recovery between irradiations, the same total dose causes less [[cell death]]. Even without interruptions, a reduction in dose rate below 0.1&amp;nbsp;Gy/h also tends to reduce cell death.&lt;ref name=ICRP103 /&gt; This technique is routinely used in radiotherapy.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

The human body contains many types of [[cell (biology)|cell]]s and a human can be killed by the loss of a single type of cells in a vital organ. For many short term radiation deaths (3 days to 30 days), the loss of two important types of cells that are constantly being regenerated causes death. The loss of cells forming [[blood cells]] ([[bone marrow]]) and the cells in the digestive system ([[Intestinal villus|microvilli]] which form part of the wall of the [[intestines]]) is fatal.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

==Management==
[[File:Death by haematopoietic syndrome of radiation sickness- influence of medical care.png|thumb|300px|Effect of medical care on acute radiation syndrome]]
Treatment is supportive with the use of [[antibiotics]], [[blood products]], [[colony stimulating factors]], and [[stem cell transplant]] as clinically indicated.&lt;ref name=Review10/&gt; Symptomatic measures may also be employed.&lt;ref name=Review10/&gt;

===Antimicrobials===
{{main|Treatment of infections after exposure to ionizing radiation}}

There is a direct relationship between the degree of the [[neutropenia]] that emerges after exposure to radiation and the increased risk of developing infection. Since there are no controlled studies of therapeutic intervention in humans, most of the current recommendations are based on animal research.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

The [[Treatment of infections after accidental or hostile exposure to ionizing radiation|treatment]] of established or suspected infection following exposure to radiation (characterized by neutropenia and fever) is similar to the one used for other febrile neutropenic patients. However, important differences between the two conditions exist. Individuals that develop neutropenia after exposure to radiation are also susceptible to irradiation damage in other tissues, such as the gastrointestinal tract, lungs and central nervous system. These patients may require therapeutic interventions not needed in other types of neutropenic patients. The response of irradiated animals to antimicrobial therapy can be unpredictable, as was evident in experimental studies where [[metronidazole]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/jac/33.1.63 |vauthors=Brook I, Ledney GD |title=Effect of antimicrobial therapy on the gastrointestinal bacterial flora, infection and mortality in mice exposed to different doses of irradiation |journal=[[Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy]] |issn=1460-2091 |volume=33 |pages=63–74 |year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[pefloxacin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Patchen ML, Brook I, Elliott TB, Jackson WE |title=Adverse effects of pefloxacin in irradiated C3H/HeN mice:  correction with glucan therapy |journal=Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy |issn=0066-4804 |volume=37 |issue=9 |pages=1882–9 |year=1993 |pmid=8239601 |pmc=188087 |doi=10.1128/AAC.37.9.1882}}&lt;/ref&gt; therapies were detrimental.

Antimicrobials that reduce the number of the strict [[Anaerobic infection|anaerobic]] component of the gut flora (i.e., [[metronidazole]]) generally should not be given because they may enhance systemic infection by aerobic or facultative bacteria, thus facilitating mortality after irradiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/09553008814551081 |vauthors=Brook I, Walker RI, MacVittie TJ |title=Effect of antimicrobial therapy on the bowel flora and bacterial infection in irradiated mice |journal=[[International Journal of Radiation Biology]] |issn=1362-3095 |volume=53 |pages=709–718 |year=1988 |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An empirical regimen of antimicrobials should be chosen based on the pattern of bacterial susceptibility and nosocomial infections in the affected area and medical center and the degree of [[neutropenia]]. Broad-spectrum empirical therapy (see below for choices) with high doses of one or more antibiotics should be initiated at the onset of fever. These antimicrobials should be directed at the eradication of Gram-negative aerobic bacilli ( i.e., Enterobacteriace, Pseudomonas ) that account for more than three quarters of the isolates causing sepsis. Because aerobic and facultative Gram-positive bacteria (mostly alpha-hemolytic streptococci) cause [[sepsis]] in about a quarter of the victims, coverage for these organisms may also be needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brook I, Ledney D |title=Quinolone therapy in the management of infection after irradiation |journal=[[Crit Rev Microbiol]] |year=1992 |pages=18235–18246 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A standardized management plane of febrile, neutropenic patients must be devised in each institution or agency. Empirical regimens must contain antibiotics broadly active against Gram-negative aerobic bacteria ([[quinolones]]: i.e., [[ciprofloxacin]], [[levofloxacin]], a third- or fourth-generation cephalosporin with pseudomonal coverage: e.g., [[cefepime]], [[ceftazidime]], or an aminoglycoside: i.e. [[gentamicin]], [[amikacin]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=explorer&amp;chrome=true&amp;srcid=0B97F0spKl2OwZTkzYTAyZjgtODRhYy00NzAwLWEzNjgtNTkyOTNmMjNlOGU4 |vauthors=Brook I, Elliot TB, Ledney GD, Shomaker MO, Knudson GB |title=Management of postirradiation infection: lessons learned from animal models |journal=[[Military Medicine (journal)|Military Medicine]] |issn=0026-4075 |year=2004 |volume=169 |pages=194–197 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Acute effects of ionizing radiation were first observed when [[Wilhelm Röntgen]] intentionally subjected his fingers to X-rays in 1895. He published his observations concerning the burns that developed, though he misattributed them to ozone, a [[free radical]] produced in air by X-rays. Other free radicals produced within the body are now understood to be more important. His injuries healed later.

The [[Radium Girls]] were female factory workers who contracted [[radiation poisoning]] from painting watch dials with [[radioluminescence|self-luminous]] paint at the [[United States Radium Corporation|United States Radium]] factory in [[Orange, New Jersey]], around 1917.

Ingestion of radioactive materials caused many [[radiation-induced cancer]]s in the 1930s, but no one was exposed to high enough doses at high enough rates to bring on acute radiation syndrome. [[Marie Curie]] died of [[aplastic anemia]] caused by radiation, a possible early incident of acute radiation syndrome.

The [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] resulted in high acute doses of radiation to a large number of Japanese, allowing for greater insight into its symptoms and dangers. Red Cross Hospital Surgeon Terufumi Sasaki led intensive research into the syndrome in the weeks and months following the Hiroshima bombings. Dr Sasaki and his team were able to monitor the effects of radiation in patients of varying proximities to the blast itself, leading to the establishment of three recorded stages of the syndrome. Within 25–30 days of the explosion, the Red Cross surgeon noticed a sharp drop in white blood cell count and established this drop, along with symptoms of fever, as prognostic standards for Acute Radiation Syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carmichael |first=Ann G. |title=Medicine: A Treasury of Art and Literature |year=1991 |publisher=Harkavy Publishing Service|location=New York|isbn=0-88363-991-2 |page=376}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Actress [[Midori Naka]], who was present during the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, was the first incident of radiation poisoning to be extensively studied. Her death on 24&amp;nbsp;August 1945, was the first death ever to be officially certified as a result of acute radiation syndrome (or "Atomic bomb disease").

===Notable incidents===
{{Main|Nuclear and radiation accidents|Lists of nuclear disasters and radioactive incidents}}
There are two major databases that track radiation accidents: The American [[ORISE]] REAC/TS and the European [[IRSN]] ACCIRAD. REAC/TS shows 417 accidents occurring between 1944 and 2000, causing about 3000 cases of acute radiation syndrome, of which 127 were fatal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Turai |first=István |author2=Veress, Katalin |title=Radiation Accidents: Occurrence, Types, Consequences, Medical Management, and the Lessons to be Learned |journal=Central European Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine |year=2001 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=3–14 |url=http://www.omfi.hu/cejoem/Volume7/Vol7No1/CE01_1-01.html |accessdate=1 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515051324/http://www.omfi.hu/cejoem/Volume7/Vol7No1/CE01_1-01.html |archivedate=2013-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ACCIRAD lists 580 accidents with 180 ARS fatalities for an almost identical period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chambrette |first=V. |author2=Hardy, S. |author3=Nenot, J.

The detailed accounting is difficult because of confounding factors. ARS may be accompanied by conventional injuries such as steam burns, or may occur in someone with a pre-existing condition undergoing radiotherapy. There may be multiple causes for death, and the contribution from radiation may be unclear. Some documents may incorrectly refer to radiation-induced cancers as radiation poisoning, or may count all overexposed individuals as survivors without mentioning if they had any symptoms of ARS. The table below attempts to catalog some cases of ARS. Many of these incidents involved additional fatalities from other causes, such as cancer, which are excluded from this table.

The '''battle of Dvin''' in 1045 was a failed attempt by the Byzantines under [[Constantine IX Monomachos]] to capture [[Dvin (ancient city)|Dvin]], then ruled by [[Abu'l-Aswar Shavur ibn Fadl]]. The Byzantines assembled a large force under the command of [[Michael Iasites]] and [[Constantine the Alan]] and allied with Armenians under the command of Vahram Pahlawuni and Liparit Orbelean. To defend the city, Abu'l-Aswar flooded the surrounding fields, limiting the attacking army's mobility and causing it to fall victim to defenders' arrows. The attackers were completely routed, and Vahram killed.

'''Bird trapping''' techniques to capture wild [[bird]]s include a wide range of techniques that have their origins in the hunting of birds for food. While hunting for food does not require birds to be caught alive, some trapping techniques capture birds without harming them and are of use in [[ornithology]] research. Wild birds may also be trapped for their display in captivity in zoological gardens or for keeping as a pet. Bird trapping was formerly unregulated, but to protect bird populations most countries have specific laws and regulations.&lt;ref name=fowling&gt;{{cite book| title= A history of fowling|author=Macpherson HA|publisher=David Douglas|place=Edinburgh|year=1897|url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924000125256#page/n13/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Fitzwater, William D.|chapter=Trapping – the oldest profession| year=1970|title= Proceedings of the 4th Vertebrate Pest Conference (1970)| url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1019&amp;context=vpcfour|publisher=University of Nebraska}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bub, H. |year=1991| title= Bird trapping and bird banding|publisher= Cornell University Press|place= New York|isbn=0801483123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Luring ==
Birds are lured into the vicinity of traps through the use of suitable habitat patches where the birds are known to visit. A specific location may be further modified by the provision of food, the use of decoy birds, the use of calls, or owls that may induce mobbing. Male birds of some species are used as decoys during the breeding seasons to challenge and beckon other males from nearby. Owls and their calls are often used to bring birds out of dense vegetations. The technique has also used by [[birdwatching|birdwatchers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1648/0273-8570-74.1.53|title=The use of decoys as a research tool for attracting wading birds|journal=Journal of Field Ornithology|volume=74|pages=53–58|year=2003|last1=Crozier|first1=Gaea E|last2=Gawlik|first2=Dale E}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.3356/JRR-05-31.1|title=The Dho-gaza and Mist Net with Eurasian Eagle-Owl (Bubo bubo) Lure: Effectiveness in Capturing Thirteen Species of European Raptors|journal=Journal of Raptor Research|volume=42|pages=48–51|year=2008|last1=Zuberogoitia|first1=Iñigo|last2=Martínez|first2=José Enrique|last3=Martínez|first3=José Antonio|last4=Zabala|first4=Jabi|last5=Calvo|first5=José F|last6=Azkona|first6=Ainara|last7=Pagán|first7=Iluminada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trapping techniques ==
Almost all traps involve the use of food, water or decoys to attract birds within range and a mechanism for restricting the movement, injuring or killing birds that come into range. Food, water, decoy birds and call playback may be used to bring birds to the trap. The use of chemical sprays on crops or food can have more widespread effects and are not usually included in trapping techniques although there are some capture techniques that make use of bait with stupefying agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Capturing Columbids at the Nest with Stupefying Baits|author1=Murton, R. K. |author2=Isaacson, A. J. |author3=Westwood, N. J.  |lastauthoramp=yes | journal= The Journal of Wildlife Management| volume=29| issue=3| year=1965|pages=647–649|doi= 10.2307/3798071|jstor=3798071 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanism can be physical and non-lethal like a noose that tightens around the leg or lethal like in deadfall traps. Lethal techniques have been used for the control of birds considered as pests or can be used in the capture of birds for food. Traps can vary in their design to capture individual birds or large flocks and are adapted according to the habitat and behaviour of the birds. Trapping is regulated in most countries and needs to be operated by trained research personnel and failure to follow precautions can lead to injury or death of birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=432–433|title=Ornithology in Laboratory and Field|edition=4| author=Pettingill, Olin Sewall Jr.|year=1970| publisher=Burgess Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Snares and Deadfalls | author=Petrides, GA| journal=The Journal of Wildlife Management| volume=10| issue=3| year=1946| pages=234–238|doi= 10.2307/3795838 | jstor=3795838}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trap Door traps===
Introduced in 2011 Trap Door traps are humane box traps with a spring-loaded lid and feeding platform.  The trap attracts target birds to feed and is triggered when the bird steps on a perch.  The trap then drops the bird via gravity into a quiet, comfortable space until they are ready for live removal and relocation.  There is no stress to the bird – no part of the trap makes contact nor does a human touch.  These traps offer flexibility in bait and attraction techniques, can be outfitted with an internal catch bag for bird removal, and some include a means to send a notification to a phone or remote operator that a bird has been captured. Trap door traps are most often used for relocating small birds that have entered public buildings and structures such as warehouses, atrium and airport terminals.

===Clap traps===
Clap traps are spring-loaded frames with [[bird netting|netting]] that are set up in two parts that come together rapidly when triggered by birds or manually controlled to enclose birds. They are usually used for ground birds but some variants are used in shallow water for the capture of waterfowl. Clap traps may be placed at a location habitually used by birds or can include luring devices.

===Funnel traps/corral traps===
Funnel traps have a narrow entrance into which birds may be lured or driven and the entrance typically leads to larger holding pen or corral (which also gives them the name of corral trap). Funnel traps can be very large and a particularly well-known large scale form was devised in the German bird observatory at Heligoland and are termed as a [[Heligoland trap]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pages=125–141|title=Construction and use of Heligoland traps|author1=Woodford J  |author2=Hussell, DJT  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1961|journal=Bird Banding|volume=32 |url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/jfo/v032n03/p0125-p0141.pdf|doi=10.2307/4510880|issue=3|jstor=4510880}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cannon nets===
{{Main|Cannon-netting}}
Flocking birds are sometimes trapped using a large net which is thrown using a series of synchronized cannons or rockets that shoot a weight that drags a net behind it over the entire flock. These nets are also called rocket nets or boom nets. Capturing entire flocks can be an important tool for studies where large numbers of birds need to be examined (such as when monitoring for viruses) or when the birds are gregarious and social. These techniques are used especially in open habitats and are particularly suited for waders and waterbirds. After examination, [[bird ringing|ringing]] or other operations, the captured birds are usually released together rather than individually.

===Mist nets===
{{Main|Mist net}}
Mist nets are fine nets that are suitable for capturing birds in woodlands. The fine net is strung across trees so as to lie in the flight path of a bird. A bird flies into the nearly invisible net and falls to a fold at the bottom of the net where it usually gets entangled. These nets are used especially in bird ringing and are typically never left unsupervised. A bird that falls is quickly removed to avoid injury to the bird and to prevent it from falling prey to predators.

===Noose traps ===
Birds that walk on the ground can be captured using an array of mono-filament nooses. These are usually placed along favoured feeding, roosting or nest sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= A noose trap for catching nesting birds|author=Gartshore, Mary E. |year=1978|journal=North American Bird Bander|volume=3|issue=1|pages=1–2|url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/nabb/v003n01/p0001-p0002.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some raptors are trapped using live-bait and nooses on the cage holding the bait.

===Birdlime===
{{Main|Birdlime}}
The muscles of perching birds allow the toes to pull inwards with some force but there are no strong muscles to open them up. The application of sticky latex, "[[birdlime]]", often obtained from a local tree to favourite perches is used in many parts of the world to capture small birds. Other variations include the use of a long stick daubed with birdlime that is manually placed over the bird to cause its wings to get stuck.&lt;ref name=india/&gt; The sale and use of birdlime is illegal in many jurisdictions, but its use was widespread in older times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Bird limes and rat glues.

===Spot-light trapping===
[[File:Lighttrap.jpg|thumb|Netting larks at night with a lantern]]
Some birds such as partridges and pheasants can be caught in the night by stunning them with bright light beams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Labisky, Ronald F. |year=1959| title=Night-lighting: A technique for capturing birds and mammals. Biological Notes. 40|publisher=Natural History Survey Division, Illinois|url=https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/17291/nightlightingtec40labi.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the 19th Century, lanterns were used for hunting larks at night in Spain, Italy and England. In Italy the technique was known as lanciatoia and in England it was referred to as [[bat-fowling]] or low belling.&lt;ref name=fowling/&gt;

==Other methods used in control and hunting==
[[File:Baitedtrap.jpg|thumb|A baited trap]]
A number of lethal techniques have been described for the killing of birds. Dead-fall traps, consisting of heavy slabs or branches, that fall onto the targets when they trigger it from below have been described from early times. A painting of such a trap for killing crows was made by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] in 1565. Birds are particularly vulnerable at their nest and a variety of methods to capture nesting birds exist around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title= Hunting strategies used in the semi-arid region of northeastern Brazil|author1=Rômulo RN Alves |author2=Lívia ET Mendonça |author3=Maine VA Confessor |author4=Washington LS Vieira |author5=Luiz CS Lopez |journal= Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine |year=2009| volume=5| issue=12 |doi=10.1186/1746-4269-5-12| url= http://www.ethnobiomed.com/content/5/1/12| pages= 12| pmid=19386121| pmc=2678999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, after a 100-year-long prohibition, the French government permitted the reintroduction of the use of stone traps ("tendelles") in the Départements [[Lozère]] and [[Aveyron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://proaction.tripod.com/proact_france/stone_traps_2009.html |author=Proact France |title=Update: Protest against Stone Crush Traps in France |date=September 17, 2009 |accessdate=August 14, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717103435/http://proaction.tripod.com/proact_france/stone_traps_2009.html |archivedate=July 17, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the Mediterranean birds are caught in France, Italy, Spain, Greece, Cyprus, Malta and other countries by traps specifically during the migratory seasons when birds travel between Europe and Africa and back. In many countries trapping of wild birds is illegal and thus represents [[poaching]]. Cyprus is a stepping stone in the eastern European-African flyway. Although illegal for decades bird trapping is a black market enterprise with a profitable sale of birds to restaurants that cater to their patrons serving [[ambelopoulia]].&lt;ref name=blc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.birdlifecyprus.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=38&amp;Itemid=56&amp;lang=en| author=BirdLifeCyprus| title=Frontline News on Illegal Bird Trapping in Cyprus – Spring 2010 |date=August 5, 2010| accessdate=August 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spring 2010 led to the killing of over a quarter million of birds in Cyprus.&lt;ref name=blc/&gt; Some birds with weak flight can be captured by chasing them. In India waterfowl were once captured by hunters who walked underwater with an earthen pot over their head. By walking up to floating ducks they could grab the legs of the duck. Empty pots were floated for a few days to make the birds accustomed to them.&lt;ref name=india&gt;{{cite journal|author=Harper, EW| title=Bird-catching in India|pages=262–268|journal=Avicultural Magazine|year=1903|volume=1|issue=8| url= https://archive.org/stream/aviculturalmagaz01avic#page/262/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restraint and handling of trapped birds==
{{manual|section|date=January 2014}}

===Waterfowl and long billed birds===
Ducks, geese and other water birds can use their wings and bills to batter handlers and inflict potentially significant injuries. Loons, grebes and herons have long, sharp beaks, which they will stab at the face of a handler. These could inflict serious injury. To restrain a captured waterfowl, the handlers can grasp the base of the neck and hold the wings back and immobile, much like they would a domestic waterfowl. (&lt;ref&gt;* Fowler, M. E. 2011. Birds.    "Restraint and Handling of Wild and Domesticated Animals." Pages 377–410. Blackwell Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;)

===Shore birds and gulls===
Shore birds are not difficult to handle. After carefully extracting them from the net, small birds can be held around the body, with the fingers at the back of the head. While shore birds are not aggressive, they do have sharp beaks. Some caution should be used in keeping the bird's beak away from the handler's face, as is the case with any bird. (&lt;ref name="Fowler"&gt;* Fowler, M. E. 2011. Birds.  Pages 377–410 in  "Restraint and Handling of Wild and Domesticated Animals."  Blackwell Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Raptors===
Raptors are adapted carnivores. Their talons and beaks are designed to rend flesh from prey. They can cause serious injury to an unwary handler!
Use of heavy leather gloves is recommended when handling raptors. Though a raptor's beak and talons can pierce it, it will provide some protection for the handler.
A simple falconer's hood can reduce stress on the bird, while a tether at the metatarsi could bind the bird to a perch or block.
Raptors can be captured by throwing a towel over the target, then wrapping it in the towel. This technique works best when the bird is on a flat surface. Another way is to wrap your hands around the body and wings of the bird, making sure to grab the feet and pull them up to the body from behind. Once you have the bird in hand, restrain the talons and head. There are different ways of doing this, and each is dictated by what you will be doing with the bird.
Owls have a defensive posture where they will lie on their back and flail at a handler with their talons. Use a towel for the owl to claw at. A trapped raptor will clamp onto the first thing it can get its talons around. While it has the towel, its legs can be secured. The talons of a large raptor must be carefully controlled! If a handler is impaled by a talon, allow the bird to move away, or risk struggle and injury. Medium-sized raptors can be restrained by a set of nylon hose for long periods of time. (&lt;ref name="Fowler" /&gt;)

===Flightless birds===
Penguins: Though flightless, a penguins' wings can be used as flippers to beat handlers. Penguins must be grasped at the base of the head from behind, so as to avoid the sharp, fish catching beak. Another way to capture large penguins is to cover them in a trash can with a hole in the bottom.
Ostrich, emu, and cassowaries: Large members of this croup have pecking beaks and long legs used to kick. The cassowary in particular has a large claw on one toe that can inflict serious lacerations and punctures, or even disembowelment.
Emus can be handled with a straddling technique, where one arm goes around the body and the other behind the legs. Ostriches and cassowaries, however, need to be moved to a smaller enclosure to be physically handled. One technique is to have a special enclosure that is open until the ostrich reaches a corner. Once in the corner, the wall of the enclosure will come to the side of the ostrich, trapping it in a narrow rectangular set of walls. Other restraint techniques include lowering and directing the head of the ostrich. This is said to discourage an ostrich from kicking forward.
A large wooden shield can be used to get a cassowary or an ostrich into a holding enclosure without injury to the handler. This technique is favored when handling cassowaries due to their formidable claws and aggressive behavior.
Kiwis are relatively easy to handle. Hold the wings and legs from the back, hold close to the body, and keep their feet immobilized and the beak away from the handler. (&lt;ref name="Fowler" /&gt;)

==Laws==
[[File:Noosinggannets.jpg|thumb|upright|Capturing gannets with a noose]]
Most countries have laws prohibiting the use of traps for capturing birds. Professional bird trapping may be regulated by licenses and researchers requiring to trap bird will usually need to obtain permissions. Hunting to some extent may however be allowed and some birds may be exempted. Traps may thus be used under some circumstances such as in the control of birds considered as pests. Some international treaties aim to protect migratory species across national boundaries. Some organizations work to protect birds from trappers. Several organizations have emerged to identify and remove traps and help authorities. Among the volunteer organizations are Lega per l´Abolizione della Caccia (League for the Abolition of Hunting), Centro Soccorso Animali Modena (CSA) Modena (Fauna Rescue Centre Modena), World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF Italia), and LIPU (Lega Italiana Protezione Uccelli or Italian League for Bird Protection, Naples) One volunteer organization removed 150,000 illegal traps during a ten-year span.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/killing-of-eagle-highlights-italys-wild-bird-slaughter-431879.html | title=Killing of eagle highlights Italy's wild bird slaughter | author= Peter Popham | date=January 13, 2007 | accessdate=August 12, 2010 | location=London | work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, the 1979 [[Birds Directive]] and its amendments seeks to protect wild birds and allows hunting only within certain limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/environment/nature_and_biodiversity/l28046_en.htm | author=[[European Union]] | title=Conservation of wild birds (Birds Directive) | accessdate=August 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Directive use of traps, bird lime (glue), nets, live decoys and poison is forbidden at all times and birds are protected during breeding and spring migration.&lt;ref name=bbc2005&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/crossing_continents/4579951.stm |author=Pettifer, Julian |title= Italy's fight against illegal bird hunts |date=June 1, 2005 |accessdate=August 12, 2010 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malta joined the European Union in 2004 and obtained certain exemptions from the protective laws that apply to the membership states regarding wild birds. Trapping of several types of [[finch]]es was allowed for five years until 2009 when the [[derogation]] was phased out. Malta had about 4,700 licensed trappers in 2007&lt;ref name=blm&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eoy.ee/arhiiv/2010/malta.pdf |author=BirdLife Malta |title=Illegal hunting and trapping of wild birds in the Maltese islands |accessdate=August 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; who, by exemption from European protective laws, continue to trap [[quail]], [[Streptopelia|turtle dove]]s, [[Eurasian golden plover|golden plover]]s and [[song thrush]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.birdlifemalta.org/Content/trapping/life_project/legislation/1037/ |author=BirdLife Malta |title=Derogations of Trapping |accessdate=August 14, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121100702/http://www.birdlifemalta.org/Content/trapping/life_project/legislation/1037/ |archivedate=November 21, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, illegal trapping continues to be a problem in Malta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article7052481.ece |title=The first sound of spring is illegal bird slaughter | author=Clover, Charles | date=March 17, 2010 | accessdate=August 12, 2010 | location=London | work=The Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In North America the [[Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918]] and its amendments protect wild birds.

==Ecological impact==
Trapping can devastate local bird populations and also impact migrants at critical stopover sites. In Malta, three local species have been extirpated by trappers and hunters—the [[peregrine falcon]], the [[barn owl]] and the [[jackdaw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8308711.stm |author=[[BBC]]| title=The fight against Malta's illegal bird hunt |date=October 17, 2009 |accessdate=August 12, 2010 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonathan Franzen]] has called Malta "the most savagely bird-hostile place in Europe".&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Franzen|Franzen, Jonathan]], [http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/07/26/100726fa_fact_franzen "Emptying the Skies,"] ''The New Yorker'', July 26, 2010, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Trapping also affects migratory birds at important stopover sites such as the Maltese islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The international impact of hunting and trapping in the Maltese islands|author=Raine, André F. Raine|year=2007|publisher=BirdLife Malta|url=https://www.birdlifemalta.org/photos/otherfiles/206.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, one book claims that peregrine falcons have again started to breed successfully since 2009 in Malta and that the main hunting organisation openly speaks against illegal hunting and trapping. The author also suggests that claims by Birdlife are often exaggerated.&lt;ref&gt;Fenech, N. 2010 A Complete Guide to the Birds of Malta.

}}In a '''case competition''', participants strive to develop the best solution to a business or education-related [[case study]] within an allocated time frame, typically with teams of two or more individuals pitted against each other in a head-to-head or broader relative ranking.&lt;ref name="CBS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UCB" /&gt; Teams deliver presentations for judges and, while competitions vary in composition, a standard [[wikt:format|format]] and purpose exists.

== History ==
The case competition concept originated in the United States and originally included participants from domestic universities. The notion of expanding to include international competitors emerged later, with the concept eventually taking hold across North America and Western Europe. Today, a wide range of international competitions are hosted in various countries in North America, Europe, and Asia,&lt;ref name="CBS"&gt;{{cite web |title=What is a case competition? |url=http://www.cbs.dk/en/CBS-International/International-Collaboration/CBS-and-Case-Competitions/CBS-and-Case-Competitions/content/What-is-a-case-competition |work=Copenhagen Business School |publisher=Copenhagen Business School |accessdate=13 May 2012 |author=Stephanie Wold Hadler |date=11 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126093841/http://www.cbs.dk/en/CBS-International/International-Collaboration/CBS-and-Case-Competitions/CBS-and-Case-Competitions/content/What-is-a-case-competition |archivedate=26 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;. International case competitions have also begun expanding beyond the undergraduate level, as competitions like the Wharton China Business Society International Case Competition offer high school divisions &lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://www.thedp.com/article/2017/02/wharton-china-business-forum|title=Wharton China Business Society International Case Competiton}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The [http://www.aub.edu.lb/osb/menarcci/ Middle East &amp; North Africa Regional Case Initiative]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (MENARCCI) at the American University of Beirut (AUB). MENARCCI's goal is to serve as a depository of all necessary knowledge about the case method, sources of cases and publishing outlets, and the links to all cases on the Region available on-line. In the Middle East, cases competitions are conducted by [http://www.aub.edu.lb the American University of Beirut] and [http://www.aucegypt.edu the American University in Cairo].

==Format==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}
Formats vary according to a number of dimensions. The following dimensions are often used to classify and compare competitions: Host: corporate versus educational institution; Participant selection: "by invitation" versus "by application"; and, Level: undergraduate, [[Postgraduate education|graduate]]. Formats may vary along practical dimensions, including: Case specificity (whether the case has been written especially for the competition or not); Number of teams; Organization (student-run, professional etc.); Rules, e.g.:Time (common formats are 3-4 or 24 hours), Materials, Degree of access to expert advice (either from within the competition or externally, and electronically or face to face).

Some competitions add complexity to create a more interesting challenge. For example, [[Ohio State University|Ohio State University (OSU)]]'s Center For International Business Education And Research (CIBER), in its annual Case Challenge, created teams from the overall pool of participants, regardless of school, dissolving the usual school-based team format. For the Ohio State scenario, once the students are assigned to teams, a full day of [[Team building|team-building]] exercises is run for competitors.

Competitions can be internal to a [[business school]], or they can involve teams from multiple schools. Sometimes the competition includes several rounds, with the final round typically judged by outside [[Senior management|company executives]] (sometimes the panel consists of executives from the actual company in the case). For example, the [[University of Washington]]’s [[Foster School of Business]]' 2010 round of its Global Business Case Competition featured a customized case on the [[Boeing|Boeing Company]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archives Global Business Case Competition|url=http://www.foster.washington.edu/centers/gbc/globalbusinesscasecompetition/Pages/archives.aspx|work=Foster|publisher=Michael G. Foster School of Business, University of Washington|accessdate=13 May 2012|author=Staff|year=2002-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Boeing executives acted as judges.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Participation==
Participants exercise skills and knowledge on a "[[Reality|real world]]" case for an actual organization, with the support of representatives who can provide professional advice.&lt;ref name="CBS" /&gt; Other competitions select an issue based on its degree of importance, and employ the competition as a means to both highlight the issue and create potential solutions through the efforts of the competitors.&lt;ref name="UCB"&gt;{{cite web|title=Center for Nonprofit and Public Leadership {{!}} Educational Case Leadership Competition |url=http://nonprofit.haas.berkeley.edu/new/elcc.html |work=University of California, Berkeley {{!}} Haas School of Business |publisher=University of California, Berkeley |accessdate=13 May 2012 |author=Staff |year=1996–2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510134032/http://nonprofit.haas.berkeley.edu/new/elcc.html |archivedate=10 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants can also be assessed as potential [[candidate]]s for [[analysis]]-based jobs within the targeted companies.

Teams in case competitions are tasked with assessing the situation facing the organization, analyzing available information, crafting a solution, and defending their recommendations. In general, teams adhere to a time limit and specific rules. Each team is judged independently, and the judges' decision is final, although a confidential summary [[evaluation]] is generally provided.&lt;ref name="Molson"&gt;{{cite web|title=Contact John Molson MBA International Case Competition|url=http://www.mbacasecomp.com/en/contact|work=John Molson MBA International Case Competition|publisher=John Molson MBA International Case Competition|accessdate=13 May 2012|author=Staff|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Cavalcade''''' is a 1933 American [[epic film|epic]] [[Pre-Code Hollywood|pre-Code]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[Frank Lloyd]]. The screenplay by [[Reginald Berkeley (writer)|Reginald Berkeley]] and [[Sonya Levien]] is based on the 1931 [[Cavalcade (play)|play of the same title]] by [[Noël Coward]]. The film stars [[Diana Wynyard]] and [[Clive Brook]].

The story presents a view of English life during the first quarter of the 20th century from [[New Year's Eve]] 1899 through [[New Year's Day]] 1933, from the point of view of well-to-do [[London]] residents Jane and Robert Marryot, their children, their close friends, and their servants. Several historical events affect the lives of the characters or serve as background for the film, including the [[Second Boer War]], the [[Queen Victoria#Death and succession|death]] of [[Queen Victoria]], the [[Sinking of the RMS Titanic|sinking]] of the ''[[RMS Titanic]]'', and [[World War I]]. Throughout the film, the passage of years is indicated by dates on [[title cards]], with a [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] [[cavalcade]] marching in the background.

The film won three [[Academy Awards]], including  [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]].

==Plot==
On the last day of 1899, Jane and Robert Marryot, an upper-class couple, return to their townhouse in a fashionable area of London before midnight, so they can keep their tradition of celebrating the new year with a midnight toast. Although Jane and Robert have been married for some years and have two young sons, Edward and Joey, they are still very much in love. Jane worries because Robert has joined the [[City of London Imperial Volunteers]] (CIV) as an officer, and will soon be leaving to serve in the [[Second Boer War]], where Jane's brother is already fighting in the [[Siege of Mafeking]]. Downstairs, the Marryots' butler Alfred Bridges mixes punch for their toast, while Cook dons her finest outfit to attend the public outdoor celebrations. Alfred has joined the CIV as a private and is also leaving soon. His wife Ellen, the Marryots' maid, worries about what will become of her and their new baby Fanny if Alfred is killed or seriously injured, but he is confident despite the pessimistic predictions of Ellen's elderly mother, Mrs. Snapper. At midnight, the Marryot and Bridges families ring in the new century while Cook dances with other revelers in the street.

Shortly thereafter, Jane bids an emotional farewell to Robert at the dock when he boards the troop ship bound for Africa, while Ellen tearfully sees off Alfred, who is leaving on the same ship. While Robert is away, Jane's friend Margaret Harris keeps her company and gives her emotional support. Margaret's young daughter Edith plays Boer War games with Edward and Joey Marryot using toy soldiers and cannons, which distresses Jane. While Jane and Margaret are attending a comic [[operetta]] at the theatre to take Jane's mind off the war, the relief of Mafeking is announced from the stage, and the audience cheers. Robert and Alfred soon return home unharmed, to the delight of their families, and Robert is [[knighthood|knighted]] for his service.

Upon his arrival, Alfred announces to his wife and mother-in-law that he has bought his own pub with money partly provided by Robert, and he and Ellen will be leaving service and moving to a flat, along with Fanny and Mrs. Snapper. As the downstairs staff have a cup of tea to celebrate Alfred's return, they receive news of the [[Queen Victoria#Death and succession|death]] of [[Queen Victoria]]. Robert rides in the beginning part of her [[funeral procession]] and the family and staff watch it from their upstairs windows.

A few years later, in 1908, Alfred has developed [[alcoholism|a drinking problem]] and is managing the pub poorly and getting behind on the family's rent due to spending the rent money on drink. Ellen and Fanny, now a schoolgirl, are embarrassed and put off by Alfred's drinking and slovenly appearance. Ellen carefully plans a genteel social evening when Jane Marryot and her son Edward, who is now in college at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], pay a visit to the Bridges' flat. Ellen does not tell Alfred about the visit and lies to the Marryots that he can't attend due to a leg injury, but just as the Marryots are leaving, Alfred shows up drunk, acts rudely and destroys a doll that Jane had given Fanny, causing Fanny to run away into the street, where she distracts herself by dancing with some [[Pearlies]]. An angry Alfred chases Fanny, attacks the Pearlies, and then stumbles into the street where he is fatally run over by a [[horse-drawn vehicle|horse-drawn]] [[fire engine]].

The following year, on July 25, 1909, Ellen and Fanny Bridges encounter the Marryot family again at the seaside, where Ellen explains that she and Fanny are living off the proceeds from the pub, now owned by Ellen. Fanny has become a talented dancer and singer. Edward Marryot has fallen in love with his childhood playmate Edith Harris. The family witnesses the [[Louis Blériot#1909 Channel crossing|historic flight]] by [[Louis Blériot]] over the [[English Channel]].

Three years later, by April 1912, Edward and Edith have married and are spending their honeymoon on a luxurious [[Four funnel liner|four funneled ocean liner]], which is dramatically revealed by a camera shot on a [[Personal flotation device|life preserver]] on board to be the ill-fated '' [[RMS Titanic]]''. Later scenes make it clear that Edward and Edith both perished in the [[Sinking of the RMS Titanic|sinking]], although the sinking itself, their deaths, and their families' initial reaction to it are not shown, it is only briefly mentioned in later dialogue.
[[File:Frank Lawton Ursula Jeans Cavalcade 1933.jpg|thumb|Fanny and Joe]]
Two years later, in 1914, [[World War I]] breaks out. Robert and Joe Marryot both serve as officers, thinking the war will be over within a few months. While on leave, Joe happens upon Fanny Bridges, whom he remembers from their childhood, performing as a featured singer and dancer in a nightclub. He re-introduces himself to her, and they bond while witnessing a [[German strategic bombing during World War I|Zeppelin air raid]] on London from the rooftop. She later becomes the star of a theatrical production. Fanny and Joe fall in love and Joe, who miraculously manages to survive the next four years of the war despite all his fellow officers being killed in action, spends most of his leave time with her, unbeknownst to his parents. He finally proposes, but she hesitates to say yes due to the difference in their [[social class]]es, although she does love him. Just after [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|armistice]] is announced in 1918, Ellen, who has found out about Fanny and Joe's love affair, goes to see Jane, reveals the affair to her, and demands that Joe marry Fanny when he returns. While a surprised and upset Jane is arguing with Ellen, Jane receives a telegram informing her that Joe has been killed in battle. Later, a grief-stricken Jane walks sadly through armistice celebrations in [[Trafalgar Square]].

Following the war, a montage shows daily life becoming even more chaotic and the social order being further disrupted, while some advocate that mankind work towards peace. The film ends on New Year's Day 1933, with Jane and Robert, now elderly, carrying on their tradition of celebrating the new year with a midnight toast to their past memories, as well as to the future.

==Production==
[[Fox Movietone]] newsreel cameramen were sent to London to record the original stage production as a guide for the film adaptation.

[[Frank Borzage]] was originally going to direct, but he departed in June 1932 to work on another project. Fox production head [[Winfield Sheehan]] decided to use a British director due to the film's setting, and [[Frank Lloyd]] was brought on board. Production took place from early October to November 29, 1932.&lt;ref name="AFI"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/4511 |accessdate=April 30, 2018 |title=Cavalcade|work=[[AFI Catalog]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was one of the first to use the words "damn" and "hell", as in "Hell of a lot". These had been used in the play. There was concern at the [[Hays Office]] that this could set a precedent. Fox president Sidney Kent was quoted saying the mild profanity "could not offend any person; and, after all, that was the real purpose of the Code. And as far as the use creating a precedent which might be followed by other producers is concerned, the best answer would be that anyone who could make a picture as good as ''Cavalcade'' might be justified in following the precedent."&lt;ref name="AFI"/&gt;

The film premiered in New York City on January 5, 1933 but did not go into general theatrical release until April 15.&lt;ref name="AFI"/&gt;

==Reception==
The film was the second most popular movie in the US in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Box Office Champions of 1933|work=[[Motion Picture Herald]]|date=February 3, 1934|page=16|url=https://archive.org/stream/motionpictureher114unse#page/n449/mode/2up|accessdate=April 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It made over US $1 million in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NOTES OF THE LONDON SCREEN: British Producers at Last Heed the Demand of the Public for An Improvement in Films -- Other Items|author=ERNEST MARSHALL.LONDON|work=The New York Times|date=29 April 1934|page=X4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It ended up making an estimated profit of £2,500,000 during its initial theatrical release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article58710895 |title=COLOSSAL FIGURES. |newspaper=[[The Sunday Times (Western Australia)|The Sunday Times]] |location=Perth |date=24 December 1933 |accessdate=21 March 2013 |page=15 Section: First Section |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mordaunt Hall of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film "most affecting and impressive" and added, "In all its scenes there is a meticulous attention to detail, not only in the settings ... but also in the selection of players ... It is unfurled with such marked good taste and restraint that many an eye will be misty after witnessing this production."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B03E1DD1E3BEF3ABC4E53DFB7668388629EDE|title=Movie Review|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film currently holds a rating of 61% on the film review aggregating website Rotten Tomatoes with the site stating the critics' consensus as "Though solidly acted and pleasant to look at, Cavalcade lacks cohesion, and sacrifices true emotion for mawkishness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/cavalcade/ |title=Cavalcade (1933) |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |date= |accessdate=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honors==
''Cavalcade'' won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]], Frank Lloyd won the [[Academy Award for Best Director]], and the [[Academy Award for Best Art Direction]] went to [[William S. Darling]].&lt;ref name="The New York Times"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/8678/Cavalcade/details |title=The New York Times: Cavalcade |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diana Wynyard was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] but lost to [[Katharine Hepburn]] for ''[[Morning Glory (1933 film)|Morning Glory]]''.

''Cavalcade'' was the first film produced by [[Fox Film Corporation]] to win the Best Picture Oscar, and the only one before it merged with 20th Century Pictures in 1935 to form [[20th Century Fox]].

==Preservation==
The [[Academy Film Archive]] preserved ''Cavalcade'' in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Preserved Projects|url=http://www.oscars.org/academy-film-archive/preserved-projects?title=cavalcade&amp;filmmaker=&amp;category=All&amp;collection=All|website=Academy Film Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Chopin''''' is a four-act [[opera]] by [[Giacomo Orefice]] (1865&amp;ndash;1922) to a libretto by Angiolo Orvieto, premiered in Milan in 1901.

The opera, which is "a wildly inaccurate account" of  the life of [[Frédéric Chopin]], is based entirely on his music, orchestrated by Orefice.&lt;ref&gt;Ashbrook (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt; The vocal score indicates the sources of the music, which include Chopin's [[sonata]]s, [[Polonaises (Chopin)|polonaises]], [[Mazurkas (Chopin)|mazurkas]] and [[Nocturnes (Chopin)|nocturnes]].&lt;ref&gt;Orefice (1904), ''passim.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The overture is based on Chopin's ''[[Fantasy on Polish Airs (Chopin)|Fantasy on Polish Airs]]'', Op. 13.&lt;ref&gt;Orefice (1904), p.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Act I is set in a village in Poland at Christmas time. Chopin declares his love to Stella (who is, like all the opera's characters except Chopin himself, entirely fictional). In Act II, set in Paris, Elio tells a group of children about the history and struggles of Poland, inspiring Chopin to fly to the piano and write a [[nocturne]].&lt;ref&gt;Ashbrook (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt; Chopin's new love, Flora, is also present.&lt;ref&gt;Pougin (1905), p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; Act III is set in [[Majorca]], where the real Chopin spent the winter of 1838-9 with [[George Sand]].&lt;ref&gt;Zamoyski (2010), p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; In this version Chopin is there with Flora and their daughter, who dies after a thunderstorm and is mourned by the local population.&lt;ref&gt;Pougin (1905), p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; In Act IV, Stella arrives in Paris from Poland just in time for Chopin to expire in her arms.&lt;ref&gt;Ashbrook (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The opera was premiered in the [[Teatro Lirico (Milan)|Teatro Lirico]], Milan, on  25 November 1901.&lt;ref&gt;Ashbrook (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt;  [[The Musical Times]] reported that "this rather curious lyrical stage-work" was "a distinct success."&lt;ref&gt;Anon (1902), p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; A production in Paris in 1905 was not well received by the critic [[Arthur Pougin]], who commented "It is an idea, perhaps ingenious but certainly bizarre, to create an opera score by borrowing the elements of various works by a genius who, throughout his life, never dreamt of writing for the theatre", and concluded that Orifece had committed "a sacrilege".&lt;ref&gt;Pougin (1905), p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;  A modern assessment suggests that the opera is "in essence a [[kitsch]] contribution to the last vestiges of late 19th-century romanticized [[bohemianism]] and to the Italian '[[scapigliatura]]'".&lt;ref&gt;Lanza (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The opera was performed at the Opera Wrocławska in [[Wrocław]], Poland, in 2010 as part of the Chopin bicentenary celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chopin2010.pl/en/calendar/list-of-events/cal/event/0//3508-opera-chopin-giacomo-orefice.html "Opera 'Chopin' by Giacomo Orefice"] on Chopin2010 website, accessed 5 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''code name Geronimo controversy''' came about after media reports that the U.S. operation to [[Death of Osama bin Laden|kill Osama bin Laden]] used the [[code name]] "Geronimo" to refer to either the overall operation, to fugitive bin Laden himself or to the act of killing or capturing bin Laden.

Press reports claimed that "Geronimo" was used in the raid to refer to bin Laden himself,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/05/02/eveningnews/main20059015.shtml?tag=pop|title=To the bottom of the sea: Bin Laden's last day|publisher=CBS Evening News|date=2 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/03/world/asia/03intel.html?_r=2 |title=Behind the Hunt for Bin Laden|publisher=New York Times | date = 2 May 2011 | accessdate = 9 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but this was later contradicted by official sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/05/05/bin.laden.geronimo/index.html|title=Native Americans object to linking Geronimo to bin Laden|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official mission [[code name]] was ''Operation Neptune Spear''&lt;ref name="abcnewskillmission"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2011/05/us-official-this-was-a-kill-mission.html|title=US Official: "This Was a Kill Mission"|author=Jake Tapper|publisher=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/GMA/statuses/65551207896317952 @GMA Twitter, 5/3]&lt;/ref&gt; (a reference to the [[trident]] in the [[SEAL]] [[Special Warfare insignia|insignia]]), with ''Jackpot'' as the code name for bin Laden as an individual and ''Geronimo'' as the code word for bin Laden's capture or death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='For God and Country Geronimo, Geronimo, Geromimo'|date=May 3, 2011|url=http://blogs.cbn.com/beltwaybuzz/archive/2011/05/03/for-god-and-country-geronimo-geronimo-geromimo.aspx|work=CBN News|publisher=Christian Broadcasting Network|accessdate=May 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the book ''[[No Easy Day]]'', former SEAL Matt Bissonnette, who participated in the mission, states that "Geronimo" was the code name for bin Laden.&lt;ref&gt;Owen, Mark, and Kevin Maurer, ''[[No Easy Day]]'' (2012), Chapter 10, [[Dutton Penguin]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The historical [[Geronimo]] was a leader of the [[Chiricahua|Chiricahua Apache]] who defied the U.S. government and eluded capture.

''[[Channel 4 News]]'' said "According to some analysis today, the U.S. military chose the code name because bin Laden, like Geronimo, had evaded capture for years. If they were trying to avoid mythmaking, it seems they chose the wrong code name."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.channel4.com/news/why-was-the-bin-laden-operation-called-geronimo Target bin Laden: why was he code named 'Geronimo'?]." [[Channel 4 News]]. May 3, 2011. Retrieved on May 3, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Once bin Laden was killed, one of the commanders reported "Geronimo E-KIA", meaning that the mission had ended with the "Enemy [[Killed In Action]]".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/05/02/eveningnews/main20059015.shtml?tag=pop To the bottom of the sea: Bin Laden's last day]." ''[[CBS News]]''. May 2, 2011. Retrieved on May 4, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Native Americans objected to the use of the name ''Geronimo''. "It's how deeply embedded the 'Indian as enemy' is in the collective mind of America," said [[Suzan Shown Harjo]], president of the Washington, D.C.-based Morning Star Institute, a Native American advocacy group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=King|first=Ledyard|title=Indian leaders cry foul over bin Laden 'Geronimo' nickname|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2011-05-05-bin-laden-american-indians-geronimo_n.htm|accessdate=20 May 2011|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=May 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; "There is little doubt [the] use of a leader like Geronimo to refer to bin Laden is ill-advised," wrote [[Keith Harper (lawyer)|Keith Harper]], an attorney and member of the [[Cherokee Nation]], in an email with a reporter for ''[[The Washington Post]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Tucker, Neely|title=American Indians object to 'Geronimo' as code for bin Laden raid|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/american-indians-object-to-geronimo-as-code-name-for-bin-laden-raid/2011/05/03/AF2FZIjF_story.html|date=May 3, 2011|work=The Washington Post |accessdate=May 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The leaders of several Native American Indian tribes urged President Obama to retroactively rename the military code name "Geronimo" used by the SEALS during the killing of bin Laden.&lt;ref name="Tribes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/blog/inside-politics/2011/may/4/indian-tribes-strike-geronimo-bin-laden-operation-/|title=Indian tribes: Strike Geronimo from bin Laden operation name|author=Stephen Dinan|work=The Washington Times |date=May 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/04/us-binladen-geronimo-idUSTRE74378U20110504?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=topNews|title=Bin Laden, Geronimo link angers Native Americans|date=May 4, 2011|author=Michelle Nichols|agency=Reuters  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Montoya"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/us_bin_laden_geronimo|title=AP NewsBreak: Geronimo's tribe seeks apology|author=Susan Montoya Bryan|agency=Associated Press|date=May 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fort Sill Apache Tribal Chairman Jeff Houser sent a letter to President Obama, decrying the linking of "the legendary Apache warrior" to a "mass murder and cowardly terrorist...Unlike the coward Osama bin Laden, Geronimo faced his enemy in numerous battles and engagements. He is perhaps one of the greatest symbols of Native American resistance in the history of the United States."&lt;ref name="Montoya"/&gt; Questions to the White House about the code name were referred to the Defense Department, which stated no disrespect was meant and that code names are generally chosen at random. Navajo Nation President Ben Shelly told ''[[The Washington Times]]'' that "Even though the operation to capture or kill bin Laden is over...the name should be changed so that children don't encounter it in the history books."&lt;ref name="Tribes"/&gt;

The [[Onondaga people|Onondaga]] Council of Chiefs said that the use of code name Geronimo perpetuates negative stereotypes about Indians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Onondagas-Rip-Osamas-Geronimo-Code-Name-121246039.html|title=Onondagas Rip Osama's "Geronimo" Code Name|date=4 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nez Perce tribe|Nez Perce]] member Loretta Tuell, staff director and chief counsel for the [[Senate Indian Affairs Committee]], said "These inappropriate uses of Native American icons and cultures are prevalent throughout our society, and the impacts to Native and non-Native children are devastating".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2011/05/onondaga_nation_leaders_blast.html|title=Onondaga Nation leaders blast 'Geronimo' codename for Bin Laden|date=4 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeff Houser, chairman of Geronimo's [[Fort Sill Apache Tribe]], wrote a letter to President Obama saying "We are quite certain that the use of the name Geronimo as a code for Osama bin Laden was based on misunderstood and misconceived historical perspectives of Geronimo and his armed struggle against the United States and Mexican governments".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/world/breakingnews/apnewsbreak-fort-sill-apache-leader-seeks-apology-from-obama-over-use-of-geronimo-code-name-121275979.html|title=Senate panel to discuss Geronimo code name, Native American concerns about racial stereotypes|date=5 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geronimo's great-grandson, [[Vietnam War]] veteran Harlyn Geronimo, issued a statement requesting explanations and apologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/05/10/136173831/code-name-geronimo-sparks-anger|date=10 May 2011|title=Code Name 'Geronimo' Sparks Anger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 May 2011, President Obama was interviewed by ''[[60 Minutes]]'' saying "There was a point before folks had left, before we had gotten everybody back on the helicopter and were flying back to base, where they said Geronimo has been killed, and Geronimo was the code name for bin Laden."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/ict_sbc/geronimo-was-the-code-name-for-bin-laden/|title=Geronimo was the Code Name for bin Laden|author=Steven Newcomb |date=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CAFx_logo_2016.png|right|frameless]]
'''Copenhagen Architecture Festival''' (CAFx) was founded in 2014 in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]] at the initiative of Josephine Michau, Peter Møller Rasmussen and Mads Farsø.
The title of the festival's first year (2014) was Copenhagen Architecture Festival x Film with a strong focus on the film medium. In 2015, the festival expanded to exhibitions, master classes and seminars as well to a further festival edition in [[Aarhus]]: Aarhus Architecture Festival (AAFx). The number of visitors doubled from 4.000 visitors in 2014 to 8.000 visitors in 2015.

Since then, the festival has grown in both scope and ambition. In 2016, the program covered more than 150 events, providing a wide range of approaches to architecture in three cities, as now the festival also runs in [[Aalborg]]: Aalborg Architecture Festival (ALAFx). Furthermore, the festival organized its first Summer School on Film and Architecture in August 2016 in Aarhus, inviting 6 architects and artists to run 3 masterclasses.

In 2017, all three festival editions CAFx, AAFx and ALAFx took place simultaneously under the headline "Architecture As Identity", which had a span of over 150 events.
As well as last year, CAFx is organizing a Summer School on Film and Landscape, taking place in August 2017 on the Danish west coast of [[Lemvig]].

The goal of the festival is to extend the idea of what architecture can be and how it seeps everywhere in human lives. All of the cities have a strong architectural identity and local ambassadors co-curating and conducting the program.


The festival is led by festival director Josephine Michau and strategic director Mads Farsø.
The main supporters of the Festival are Realdania, Dreyers Fond, Københavns Kommune, Det Danske Filminstitut and Statens Kunstfond.

'''Croatian–Ottoman Wars''' ({{lang-tr|Osmanlı-Hırvatistan Savaşları|link=no}}, {{lang-hr|Hrvatsko-osmanski ratovi|link=no}}) can refer to one of the several conflicts between the [[Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)|Kingdom of Croatia]] (in [[Croatia in union with Hungary|Kingdom of Hungary-Croatia]] and in [[Habsburg Monarchy]]) and the [[Ottoman Empire]]:
*[[Long Campaign]] (1443–1444) of the King [[Vladislaus II of Hungary]]
*[[Hundred Years' Croatian–Ottoman War]], War for Croatia - a period of near constant mostly low-intensity warfare ("Small War") approximately 1493–1593 (from the [[Battle of Krbava Field]] to the [[Battle of Sisak]])
*[[Long War (Ottoman wars)|Long War]] (1593–1606)
*[[Austro-Turkish War (1663–1664)]]
*[[Great Turkish War]] (1683–1699)

*[[Austro-Turkish War (1787–1791)]]
*[[Austro-Hungarian campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878]]
{{expand list|date=September 2012}}

The Kingdom of Croatia-Hungary gradually lost most of its territory on the eastern Adriatic coast to the Ottomans, leaving only the possessions of the [[Republic of Venice]] in [[Dalmatia]], for whom the Croats took part in the [[Ottoman–Venetian Wars]]. Of particular note for the history of Dalmatia was the [[Morean War]].

'''Diwali''', '''Deepavali''' or '''Dipavali''' is the [[Hindu]] festival of lights, which is celebrated every autumn in the northern hemisphere (spring in southern hemisphere).&lt;ref name="OED-Diwali"&gt;The New Oxford Dictionary of English (1998) {{ISBN|0-19-861263-X}}. p. 540 "'''Diwali''' /dɪwɑːli/ (also '''Divali''') '''noun''' a Hindu festival with lights...".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/166786/Diwali Diwali] ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most popular festivals of [[Hinduism]], Diwali symbolises the spiritual "victory of light over darkness, good over evil and knowledge over ignorance." Light is a metaphor for knowledge and consciousness.&lt;ref name= Heiligman31&gt;{{cite book|author1=Vasudha Narayanan|author2=Deborah Heiligman|title=Celebrate Diwali|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rdTJJEQsDHoC&amp;pg=PA31|year=2008|publisher=National Geographic Society|isbn=978-1-4263-0291-6|page=31}}, '''Quote:''' "All the stories associated with Deepavali, however, speak of the joy connected with the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=htoday/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Jean Mead, How and why Do Hindus Celebrate Divali?, {{ISBN|978-0-237-534-127}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the celebration, temples, homes, shops and office buildings are brightly illuminated.&lt;ref name=fs&gt;Frank Salamone (2004), Encyclopedia of Religious Rites, Rituals and Festivals, {{ISBN|978-0415880916}}, Routledge, pp. 112–13, 174, 252&lt;/ref&gt; The preparations, and rituals, for the festival typically last five days, with the climax occurring on the third day coinciding with the darkest night of the [[Hindu calendar|Hindu lunisolar]] month [[Kartika (month)|Kartika]]. In the [[Gregorian calendar]], the festival generally falls between mid-October and mid-November.&lt;ref name=melton252/&gt;

Diwali is also a major cultural event for the Hindu and Jain diaspora from the Indian subcontinent.&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/6LYPWvqVY?url=http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2010/08/23/india-journal-tis-the-season-to-be-shopping/ India Journal: ‘Tis the Season to be Shopping] Devita Saraf, The Wall Street Journal (August 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Henry Johnson|2007|pp=71–73}}{{sfn|Kelly|1988|pp=40–55}}

The five-day festival originated in the [[Indian subcontinent]] and is mentioned in early [[Sanskrit]] texts. The names of the festive days of Diwali, as well as the rituals, vary by region. Diwali is usually celebrated eighteen days after the [[Navrati|Dussehra]] (Dasara, Dasain) festival with [[Dhanteras]], or the regional equivalent, marking the first day of the festival when celebrants prepare by cleaning their homes and making decorations on the floor, such as ''[[rangoli]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Bellenir (1997), Religious Holidays and Calendars: An Encyclopedic Handbook, 2nd Edition, {{ISBN|978-0780802582}}, Omnigraphics&lt;/ref&gt; The second day is ''Choti Diwali'', or equivalent in north India, while for Hindus in the south of India it is Diwali proper. Western, central, eastern and northern Indian communities observe Diwali on the third day and the darkest night of the traditional month. In some parts of India, the day after Diwali is marked with the ''Govardhan Puja'' and ''Diwali Padva'', which is dedicated to the relationship between wife and husband. Some Hindu communities mark the last day as [[Bhai Dooj]], which is dedicated to the bond between sister and brother,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rajat Gupta|author2=Nishant Singh|author3=Ishita Kirar|title=Hospitality &amp; Tourism Management|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DatDDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA84|publisher=Vikas |isbn=978-93-259-8244-4|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other Hindu and Sikh craftsmen communities mark this day as ''[[Vishwakarma Puja]]'' and observe it by performing maintenance in their work spaces and offering prayers.&lt;ref name=haar2009&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kristen Haar|author2=Sewa Singh Kalsi|title=Sikhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YOI1nB_zTyAC |year=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-0647-2|pages=98–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Shobhna Gupta|title=Festivals of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g4TtrdejbTEC&amp;pg=PA84 |year=2002|publisher=Har-Anand |isbn=978-81-241-0869-7|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The five-day celebration is observed every year in early autumn after the conclusion of the summer harvest and coincides with the new moon, known as the ''amāsvasya'' – the darkest night of the [[Hindu calendar|Hindu lunisolar calendar]].{{sfn|Tracy Pintchman|2005|pp=61–62}} The festivities begin two days before ''amāsvasya'', on Dhanteras, and extends two days after, the second day of the first fortnight of the month of Kartik.{{sfn|Tracy Pintchman|2005|p=61}} According to Indologist, Constance Jones who specialises in religious sociology, this night ends the lunar month of Ashwin and starts the month of Kartika.{{sfn|Constance Jones|2011|pp= 252–53}}{{refn|group=note|Historical records appear inconsistent about the name of the lunar month in which Diwali is observed. One of the earliest reports on this variation was by Wilson in 1847. He explained that though the actual Hindu festival day is the same, it is identified differently in regional calendars because there are two traditions in the Hindu calendar. One tradition starts a new month from the new moon, while the other starts it from the full moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = H.H. Wilson| title= Religious festivals of the Hindus | journal= Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland| volume=9 | year=1847|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The darkest night is the apex of the celebration and coincides with the second half of October or early November in the Gregorian calendar.{{sfn|Constance Jones|2011|pp= 252–53}}

The festival climax is on the third day and is called the main Diwali. It is an official holiday in about a dozen countries, while the other festive days are regionally observed as either public or optional restricted holidays in [[India]].&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://india.gov.in/calendar/calendar.php|title=Indian Government Holiday Calendar|publisher=National Portal of India |accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Nepal]], it is also a multiday festival, although the days and rituals are named differently, with the climax being called the ''[[Tihar (festival)|Tihar]]'' festival by Hindus and ''[[Swanti (festival)|Swanti]]'' festival by Buddhists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert Isaac Levy|author2=Kedar Raj Rajopadhyaya|title= Mesocosm: Hinduism and the Organization of a Traditional Newar City in Nepal|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ngacsMPGJPcC|year =1990|publisher =University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-06911-4|pages=411–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Shrestha |first= Bal Gopal |date= July 2006 |title= The Svanti Festival: Victory over Death and the Renewal of the Ritual Cycle in Nepal |journal= Contributions to Nepalese Studies |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=206–21 |url= http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/contributions/pdf/CNAS_33_02_03.pdf  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Diwali festival is likely a fusion of harvest festivals in ancient India.{{sfn|Constance Jones|2011|pp= 252–53}} It is mentioned in Sanskrit texts such as the ''[[Padma Purana]]'', the ''[[Skanda Purana]]'' both of which were completed in the second half of the 1st millennium CE. The ''diyas'' (lamps) are mentioned in Skanda Kishore Purana as symbolising parts of the sun, describing it as the cosmic giver of light and energy to all life and which seasonally transitions in the Hindu calendar month of Kartik.&lt;ref name=tp&gt;{{harvnb|Tracy Pintchman|2005|pp=59–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|James G. Lochtefeld|2002|p=355}} 

King Harsha refers to Deepavali, in the 7th century Sanskrit play ''[[Nagananda]]'', as ''Dīpapratipadotsava'' (''dīpa'' = light, ''pratipadā'' = first day, ''utsava'' = festival), where lamps were lit and newly engaged brides and grooms received gifts.&lt;ref name=bnsharma&gt;BN Sharma, Festivals of India, South Asia Books, {{ISBN|978-0836402834}}, pp. 9–35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yaksha&gt;{{cite book|last1=Varadpande|first1=Manohar Laxman|title=History of Indian Theatre, Volume 1|date=1987|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=9788170172215|page=159}}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 October 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rajasekhara]] referred to Deepavali as ''Dipamalika'' in his 9th century ''Kavyamimamsa'', wherein he mentions the tradition of homes being whitewashed and oil lamps decorated homes, streets and markets in the night.&lt;ref name=bnsharma/&gt;

Diwali was also described by numerous travellers from outside India. In his 11th century memoir on India, the Persian traveller and historian [[Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī|Al Biruni]] wrote of Deepavali being celebrated by Hindus on the day of the New Moon in the month of Kartika.&lt;ref&gt;R.N.

Chattopadhyaya), Volume 2, Part 5, Pearson Education, {{ISBN|978-8131719589}}, pp. 183–84&lt;/ref&gt; The Venetian merchant and traveller [[Niccolò de' Conti]] visited India in the early 15th-century and wrote in his memoir, "on another of these festivals they fix up within their temples, and on the outside of the roofs, an innumerable number of oil lamps... which are kept burning day and night" and that the families would gather, "clothe themselves in new garments", sing, dance and feast.{{sfn|Abraham Eraly|2015|pp=315–16}}{{sfn|Robert Sewell|2006|pp=85–86}} The 16th-century Portuguese traveler [[Domingo Paes]] wrote of his visit to the Hindu [[Vijayanagara Empire]], where ''Dipavali'' was celebrated in October with householders illuminating their homes, and their temples, with lamps.{{sfn|Robert Sewell|2006|pp=85–86}}

Islamic historians of the Delhi Sultanate and the Mughal Empire era also mentioned Diwali and other Hindu festivals. A few, notably the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Akbar]], welcomed and participated in the festivities,{{sfn|Richard M. Eaton|1996|pp=159–60 with footnotes}}{{sfn|Charles Melville|2012|p=526, Quote: "He [Mahmud b.

Publications from the British colonial era also made mention of Diwali, such as the note on Hindu festivals published in 1799 by [[William Jones (philologist)|Sir William Jones]], a philologist known for his early observations on [[Sanskrit]] and Indo-European languages.&lt;ref name=jone1799p263/&gt; In his paper on ''The Lunar Year of the Hindus'', Jones, then based in [[Bengal]], noted four of the five days of Diwali in the autumn months of ''Aswina-Cartica'' [sic] as the following: ''Bhutachaturdasi Yamaterpanam'' (2nd day), ''Lacshmipuja dipanwita'' (the day of Diwali), ''Dyuta pratipat Belipuja'' (4th day), and ''Bhratri dwitiya'' (5th day).

===Hinduism===
[[File:Raja Ravi Varma, Goddess Lakshmi, 1896.jpg|thumb|Diwali is celebrated in the honour of [[Lakshmi]], the goddess of wealth.]]
The religious significance of Diwali varies regionally within India. The festival is associated with a diversity of deities, traditions, and symbolism.&lt;ref name= Heiligman31/&gt;&lt;ref name=vasudha31/&gt;{{sfn|Jessica Frazier|Gavin Flood|2011|p=255}} These variations, states Constance Jones, may reflect diverse local autumn harvest festivals that fused into one pan-Hindu festival with a shared spiritual significance and ritual grammar while retaining local traditions.&lt;ref name=melton252/&gt;

One tradition links the festival to legends in the Hindu epic ''[[Ramayana]]'', where Diwali is the day [[Rama]], [[Sita]], [[Lakshmana]] and [[Hanuman]] reached [[Ayodhya]] after a period in exile and Rama's army of good defeated demon king [[Ravana]]'s army of evil.{{sfn|Om Lata Bahadur|2006|p=91}}

Many Hindus associate the festival with [[Lakshmi]], the goddess of wealth and prosperity, and wife of [[Vishnu]]. According to Pintchman, the start of the 5-day Diwali festival is stated in some popular contemporary sources as the day Goddess Lakshmi was born from [[Samudra manthan]], the churning of the cosmic ocean of milk by the [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] (gods) and the [[Asuras]] (demons) – a Vedic legend that is also found in several [[Puranas]] such as the ''[[Padma Purana]]'', while the night of Diwali is when Lakshmi chose and wed Vishnu.&lt;ref name=tp/&gt;&lt;ref name="Karen Pechilis 2007 pp 273-275"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pechilis |first1=Karen |year=2007 |title=Guests at God's Wedding: Celebrating Kartik among the Women of Benares |journal=The Journal of Asian Studies |volume=66 |issue=1 |pages=273–75 |doi=10.1017/S0021911807000460}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with Lakshmi, who is representative of [[Vaishnavism]], [[Ganesha]], the elephant-headed son of [[Parvati]] and [[Shiva]] of [[Shaivism]] tradition, is remembered as one who symbolises ethical beginnings and the remover of obstacles.{{sfn|Om Lata Bahadur|2006|p=91}}

Hindus of eastern India associate the festival with the goddess [[Durga]], or her fierce avatar [[Kali]] ([[Shaktism]]), who symbolises the victory of good over evil.{{sfn|Laura Amazzone|2012|}}&lt;ref&gt;Buck, C.

Coogan|2003|pp=152–53}}{{sfn|Lavanya Vemsani|2016|pp=190–91}}

Trade and merchant families and others also offer prayers to [[Saraswati]], who embodies music, literature and learning and [[Kubera]], who symbolizes book-keeping, treasury and wealth management.&lt;ref name=tp/&gt; In western states such as Gujarat, and certain northern Hindu communities of India, the festival of Diwali signifies the start of a new year.{{sfn|Michael D.

Jeffrey Long, a scholar of Jain and Hindu studies, states that in Jain tradition, Diwali is celebrated in observance of "Mahavira Nirvana Divas", the physical death and final nirvana of [[Mahavira]]. The Jain Diwali celebrated in many parts of India has similar practices to the Hindu Diwali, such as the lighting of lamps and the offering of prayers to Lakshmi. However, the focus of the Jain Diwali remains the dedication to Mahavira.{{sfn|Jeffery D. Long|2009|pp=26, 42}} This practice of lighting lamps first began on the day of Mahavira's death in 527 BCE according to the Jain tradition,{{refn|group=note|Scholars contest the 527 BCE date and consider Mahavira's biographical details as uncertain.

Grewal, a scholar of Sikhism and Sikh history, Diwali in the Sikh tradition is older than the sixth Guru Hargobind legend. [[Guru Amar Das]], the third Guru of the Sikhs, built a well in Goindwal with eighty-four steps and invited Sikhs to bathe in its sacred waters on Baisakhi and Diwali as a form of community bonding. Over time, these spring and autumn festivals became the most important of Sikh festivals and holy sites such as Amritsar became focal points for annual pilgrimages.{{sfn|J. S. Grewal|1998|pp=50–51, 60, 73–78, 93}} The festival of Diwali, according to Ray Colledge, highlights three events in Sikh history: the founding of the city of Amritsar in 1577, the release of Guru Hargobind from the Mughal prison, and the day of Bhai Mani Singh's martyrdom in 1738 as a result of his failure to pay a fine for trying to celebrate Diwali and thereafter refusing to convert to Islam.{{sfn|Ray Colledge|2017|pp=276–78}}{{sfn|Pashaura Singh|Louis E.

Diwali is a post-harvest festival celebrating the bounty following the arrival of the monsoon in the subcontinent.{{sfn|Darra Goldstein|2015|pp=222–23}} Depending on the region, celebrations include prayers before one or more Hindu deities, the most common being Lakshmi.&lt;ref name="dhcd"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Suzanne Barchers 2013"&gt;Suzanne Barchers (2013), The Big Book of Holidays and Cultural Celebrations, Shell Education, {{ISBN|978-1425810481}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to David Kinsley, an Indologist and scholar of Indian religious traditions particularly in relation to goddess worship, Lakshmi symbolizes three virtues: wealth and prosperity, fertility and abundant crops, as well as good fortune.{{sfn|David Kinsley|1988|pp=33–34}} Merchants seek Lakshmi's blessings in their ventures and will ritually close their accounting year during Diwali.{{sfn|David Kinsley|1988|pp=33–34}} Fertility motifs appear in agricultural offerings brought before Lakshmi by farming families, who give thanks for the recent harvests and seek her blessings for prosperous future crops.{{sfn|David Kinsley|1988|pp=33–34}} A symbolic piece of traditional fertilizer, a dried piece of cow dung, is included in the ensemble in Odisha and Deccan region villages, an agricultural motif according to Kinsley.{{sfn|David Kinsley|1988|pp=33–34}} Another aspect of the festival is remembering the ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Diane P.

Rituals and preparations for Diwali begin days or weeks in advance, typically after the festival of Dusshera that precedes Diwali by about 20 days.{{sfn|Om Lata Bahadur|2006|p=91}} The festival formally begins two days before the night of Diwali, and ends two days thereafter.

===Dhanteras (Day 1)===

''Dhanteras'', derived from ''Dhan'' meaning wealth and ''teras'' meaning thirteenth, marks the thirteenth day of the dark fortnight of Kartik and the beginning of Diwali.{{sfn|Tracy Pintchman|2005|pp=59–60}} On this day, many Hindu's clean their homes and business premises. They install ''diyas'', small earthen oil-filled lamps that they light up for the next five days, near Lakshmi and Ganesha iconography.{{sfn|Tracy Pintchman|2005|pp=59–60}}{{sfn|Om Lata Bahadur|2006|pp=92–93}} Women and children decorate doorways within homes and offices with rangoli, colourful designs made from rice flour, flower petals and coloured sand,{{sfn|Paul Fieldhouse|2017|pp=150–51}} while the boys and men decorate the roofs and walls of family homes, markets and temples. The day also marks a major shopping day to purchase new utensils, home equipment, jewelry, firecrackers and other items.{{sfn|Om Lata Bahadur|2006|pp=92–93}}&lt;ref name=tp/&gt;&lt;ref name="Karen Pechilis 2007 pp 273-275"/&gt; On the evening of Dhanteras, families offer prayers (''puja'') to Lakshmi and Ganesha, and lay offerings of puffed rice, candy toys, rice cakes and ''batashas'' (hollow sugar cakes).{{sfn|Om Lata Bahadur|2006|pp=92–93}}

According to Tracy Pintchman, Dhanteras is a symbol of annual renewal, cleansing and an auspicious beginning for the next year.{{sfn|Tracy Pintchman|2005|pp=59–60}} The term ''"Dhan"'' for this day also alludes to the [[Ayurvedic]] icon [[Dhanvantari]], the god of health and healing, who is believed to have emerged from the "churning of cosmic ocean" on the same day as Lakshmi.{{sfn|Tracy Pintchman|2005|pp=59–60}} Some communities, particularly those active in Ayurvedic and health-related professions, pray or perform [[yajna|havan]] rituals to Dhanvantari on Dhanteras.{{sfn|Tracy Pintchman|2005|pp=59–60}}

===Choti Diwali, Naraka Chaturdasi (Day 2)===

}}
Choti Diwali, also known as ''Naraka Chaturdasi'', is the second day of festivities coinciding with the fourteenth day of the second fortnight of the lunar month. The term "choti" means little, while "Naraka" means hell and "Chaturdasi" means "fourteenth".{{sfn|Tracy Pintchman|2005|pp=60–61}} The day and its rituals are interpreted as ways to liberate any souls from their suffering in "Naraka", or hell, as well as a reminder of spiritual auspiciousness. For some Hindus, it is a day to pray for the peace to the manes, or deified souls of one's ancestors and light their way for their journeys in the cyclic afterlife.{{sfn|Tracy Pintchman|2005|pp=60–61, 63}} A mythological interpretation of this festive day is the destruction of the asura (demon) [[Narakasura]] by Krishna, a victory that frees 16,000 imprisoned princesses kidnapped by Narakasura.{{sfn|Tracy Pintchman|2005|pp=60–61}}

Naraka Chaturdasi is also a major day for purchasing festive foods, particularly sweets. A variety of sweets are prepared using flour, semolina, rice, chickpea flour, dry fruit pieces powders or paste, milk solids (''mawa'' or ''khoya'') and clarified butter (''ghee'').{{sfn|Darra Goldstein|2015|pp=222–23}} According to Goldstein, these are then shaped into various forms, such as laddus, barfis, halvah, kachoris, shrikhand and sandesh, rolled and stuffed delicacies, such as maladu, susiyam, pottukadalai. Sometimes these are wrapped with edible silver foil ([[vark]]). Confectioners and shops create Diwali-themed decorative displays, selling these in large quantities, which are stocked for home celebrations to welcome guests and as gifts.{{sfn|Darra Goldstein|2015|pp=222–23}}{{sfn|Om Lata Bahadur|2006|pp=92–93}} Families also prepare homemade delicacies for the main Diwali day.{{sfn|Darra Goldstein|2015|pp=222–23}} Choti Diwali is also a day for visiting friends, business associates and relatives, and exchanging gifts.{{sfn|Om Lata Bahadur|2006|pp=92–93}}

This day is commonly celebrated as Diwali in [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Goa]], and [[Karnataka]]. Some South Indian Hindus receive an oil massage and then take a ritual bath.{{sfn|Om Lata Bahadur|2006|pp=93–94}} Many visit their favorite Hindu temple.{{sfn|Hillary Rodrigues|2016|p=29}}

===Diwali, Lakshmi Puja (Day 3)===
{{Main|Lakshmi Puja}}
The third day is the height of the festival,{{sfn|Stephen Jacobs|2010|p=26}} and coincides with the last day of the dark fortnight of the lunar month. This is the day when Hindu, Jain and Sikh temples and homes are aglow with lights, thereby making it the "festival of lights".{{sfn|Tracy Pintchman|2005|pp=61–62}}

The youngest members in the family visit their elders, such as grandparents and other senior members of the community, on this day. Small business owners give gifts or special bonus payments to their employees between Dhanteras and Diwali.{{sfn|Om Lata Bahadur|2006|pp=93–94}}{{sfn|Constance Jones|2011|p= 254}} Shops either do not open or close early on this day allowing employees to enjoy family time. Shopkeepers and small operations perform ''puja'' rituals in their office premises. Unlike some other festivals, the Hindu typically do not fast on Diwali, rather they feast and share the bounties of the season at their workplaces, community centres, temples and homes.{{sfn|Om Lata Bahadur|2006|pp=93–94}}

[[File:Diwali Festival.jpg|left|thumb|Lighting candle and clay lamp in their house and at temples during Diwali night]]
As the evening approaches, celebrants will wear new clothes or their best outfits, teenage girls and women in particular wear saris and jewelry.{{sfn|Om Lata Bahadur|2006|pp=94–95}} At dusk, family members gather for the Lakshmi puja,{{sfn|Om Lata Bahadur|2006|pp=94–95}} although prayers will also be offered to other deities, such as Ganesha, Saraswati, Rama, Lakshmana, Sita, Hanuman, or Kubera.&lt;ref name=tp/&gt; The lamps from the puja ceremony are then used to light more earthenware lamps, which are placed in rows along the parapets of temples and houses,{{sfn|Om Lata Bahadur|2006|pp=97–98}} while some ''diyas'' are set adrift on rivers and streams.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Bowker, ed., Oxford Concise Dictionary of World Religions (Oxford UP, 2000), See Festivals&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Klaus K. Klostermaier|2014|pp=59, 69}} After the ''puja'', people go outside and celebrate by lighting up ''patakhe'' (fireworks) together, and then share a family feast and ''[[South Asian sweets|mithai]]'' (sweets, desserts).&lt;ref name=tp/&gt;

The ''puja'' and rituals in the Bengali Hindu community focus on [[Kali]], the goddess of war, instead of Lakshmi.{{sfn|McDermott |2011|pp =183–88}}{{sfn|Constantina Rhodes|2010|pp=1–2}} According to Rachel Fell McDermott, a scholar of South Asian, particular Bengali, studies, in Bengal during Navaratri (Dussehra elsewhere in India) the ''[[Durga puja]]'' is the main focus, although in the eastern and north eastern states the two are synonymous, but on Diwali the focus is on the puja dedicated to Kali. These two festivals likely developed in tandem over their recent histories, states McDermott.{{sfn|McDermott|2011|pp=183–88}} Textual evidence suggests that Bengali Hindus worshipped Lakshmi before the colonial era, and that the Kali puja is a more recent phenomenon.{{refn|group=note|According to McDermott, while the Durga Puja is the largest Bengali festival and it can be traced to the 16th-century or earlier, the start of Kali puja tradition on Diwali is traceable to no earlier than about the mid-18th-century during the reign of Raja Krishnacandra Ray.{{sfn|McDermott|2011|pp=183–88}} McDermott further writes that the older historic documents of the Bengal confirm that the Bengali Hindus have long celebrated the night of Diwali with illuminations, firecrackers, foods, new account books, Lakshmi (not Kali), inviting their friends (including Europeans during the colonial era) and gambling.{{sfn|McDermott|2011|pp=183–88}} The Kali ''sarbajanin'' tradition on Diwali, with tantric elements in some locations, grew slowly into a popular Bengali tradition after the mid-1920s.{{sfn|McDermott|2011|pp=183–88}}}} Contemporary Bengali celebrations mirror those found elsewhere, with teenage boys playing with fireworks and the  sharing of festive food with family, but with the [[Shaktism|Shakti]] goddess Kali as the focus.{{sfn|June McDaniel|2004|pp=253–55}}

[[File:Sparkles phuljhari fireworks on DIWALI, festival of lights.jpg|thumb|A child playing with ''phuljhari'' on Diwali.]]
On the night of Diwali, rituals across much of India are dedicated to Lakshmi to welcome her into their cleaned homes and bring prosperity and happiness for the coming year.{{sfn|Tracy Pintchman|2005|pp=61–63}} While the cleaning, or painting, of the home is in part for goddess Lakshmi, it also signifies the ritual "reenactment of the cleansing, purifying action of the monsoon rains" that would have concluded in most of the Indian subcontinent.{{sfn|Tracy Pintchman|2005|pp=61–63}} Vaishnava families recite Hindu legends of the victory of good over evil and the return of hope after despair on Diwali night, where the main characters may include Rama, Krishna, Vamana or one of the avatars of Vishnu, the divine husband of Lakshmi.{{sfn|Tracy Pintchman|2005|pp=61–63}}{{sfn|Om Lata Bahadur|2006|pp=94–97}} At dusk, lamps placed earlier in the inside and outside of the home are lit up to welcome Lakshmi.{{sfn|Stephen Jacobs|2010|p=26}} Family members light up firecrackers, which some interpret as a way to ward off all evil spirits and the inauspicious, as well as add to the festive mood.&lt;ref name="Firecracker2"&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=GErOyV7FBNUC&amp;pg=PA175 |title = Asian American History|first=Valerie|last =Petrillo |publisher =Chicago Review Press |quote=There are firecrackers everywhere to scare off evil spirits and contribute to the festive atmosphere.| accessdate = 26 October 2011|isbn = 978-1-55652-634-3|date = 28 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Firecracker3"&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=TRyb8XqB7dEC&amp;pg=SA9-PA1 |title = The International Holiday &amp; Festival Primer|first=David|last=DeRocco |first2=Joan |last2=Dundas |author3=Ian Zimmerman|publisher=Full Blast Productions|quote=But as well as delighting the spectators, the fireworks are believed to chase away evil spirits.|accessdate = 26 October 2011|isbn = 978-1-895451-24-5|year = 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Pintchman, who quotes Raghavan, this ritual may also be linked to the tradition in some communities of paying respect to ancestors. Earlier in the season's fortnight, some welcome the souls of their ancestors to join the family for the festivities with the ''Mahalaya''. The Diwali night's lights and firecrackers, in this interpretation, represent a celebratory and symbolic farewell to the departed ancestral souls.{{sfn|Tracy Pintchman|2005|p=63}}

The celebrations and rituals of the Jains and the Sikhs are similar to those of the Hindus where social and community bonds are renewed. Major temples and homes are decorated with lights, festive foods shared with all, friends and relatives remembered and visited with gifts.{{sfn|Constance Jones|2011|p= 254}}{{sfn|Jeffery D. Long|2009|pp=26, 42}}

===Annakut, Padwa, Govardhan puja (Day 4)===
{{main|Balipratipada}}
The day after Diwali is the first day of the bright fortnight of the luni-solar calendar.{{sfn|Tracy Pintchman|2005|pp=63–64}} It is regionally called as Annakut (heap of grain), Padwa, Goverdhan puja, Bali Pratipada, Bali Padyami, Kartik Shukla Pratipada and other names.{{sfn|Paul Fieldhouse|2017|pp=150–51}}{{sfn|Tracy Pintchman|2005|pp=63–64}} According to one tradition, the day is associated with the story of Bali's defeat at the hands of Vishnu.&lt;ref name="NarayananKurup1976"&gt;{{cite book|author1=M.G.S. Narayanan|author2=K.K.N. Kurup|title=Historical Studies in Kerala|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mvELAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=12 October 2014|year=1976|publisher=Department of History, University of Calicut}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Heiligman, Celebrate Diwali, {{ISBN|978-1426302916}}, National Geographic, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; In another interpretation, it is thought to reference the legend of Parvati and her husband Shiva playing a game of ''dyuta'' (dice) on a board of twelve squares and thirty pieces, Parvati wins. Shiva surrenders his shirt and adornments to her, rendering him naked.{{sfn|Tracy Pintchman|2005|pp=63–64}} According to Handelman and Shulman, as quoted by Pintchman, this legend is a Hindu metaphor for the cosmic process for creation and dissolution of the world through the masculine destructive power, as represented by Shiva, and the feminine procreative power, represented by Parvati, where twelve reflects the number of months in the cyclic year, while thirty are the number of days in its lunisolar month.{{sfn|Tracy Pintchman|2005|pp=63–64}}

This day ritually celebrates the bond between the wife and husband,{{sfn|William D. Crump|2014|pp=112–13}} and in some Hindu communities, husbands will celebrate this with gifts to their wives. In other regions, parents invite a newly married daughter, or son, together with their spouses to a festive meal and give them gifts.{{sfn|William D. Crump|2014|pp=112–13}}

In some rural communities of the north, west and central regions, the fourth day is celebrated as Govardhan puja, honouring the legend of the Hindu god Krishna saving the cowherd and farming communities from incessant rains and floods triggered by Indra's anger,{{sfn|William D. Crump|2014|pp=112–13}} which he accomplished by lifting the Govardhan mountain. This legend is remembered through the ritual of building small mountain-like miniatures from cow dung.{{sfn|William D. Crump|2014|pp=112–13}} According to Kinsley, the ritual use of cow dung, a common fertilizer, is an agricultural motif and a celebration of its significance to annual crop cycles.{{sfn|David Kinsley|1988|pp=33–34}}{{sfn|Tracy Pintchman|2005|pp=64–65}}{{sfn|Lodrick|1987}}

The agricultural symbolism is also observed on this day by many Hindus as Annakut, literally "mountain of food". Communities prepare over one hundred dishes from a variety of ingredients, which is then dedicated to Krishna before shared among the community. Hindu temples on this day prepare and present "mountains of sweets" to the faithful who have gathered for ''darshan'' (visit).{{sfn|William D. Crump|2014|pp=112–13}} In Gujarat, Annakut is the first day of the new year and celebrated through the purchase of essentials, or ''sabras'' (literally, "good things in life"), such as salt, offering prayers to Krishna and visiting temples.{{sfn|William D. Crump|2014|pp=112–13}}

It celebrates the sister-brother bond, similar in spirit to [[Raksha Bandhan]] but it is the brother that travels to meet the sister and her family. This festive day is interpreted by some to symbolize Yama's sister Yamuna welcoming Yama with a ''tilaka'', while others interpret it as the arrival of Krishna at his sister's, Subhadra, place after defeating Narakasura. Subhadra welcomes him with a ''tilaka'' on his forehead.{{sfn|William D. Crump|2014|pp=112–13}}{{sfn|Tracy Pintchman|2005|pp=66–69}}

The day celebrates the sibling bond between brother and sister. On this day the womenfolk of the family gather, perform a puja with prayers for the well being of their brothers, then return to a ritual of feeding their brothers with their hands and receiving gifts. According to Pintchman, in some Hindu traditions the women recite tales where sisters protect their brothers from enemies that seek to cause him either bodily or spiritual harm.{{sfn|Tracy Pintchman|2005|pp=66–69}} In historic times, this was a day in autumn when brothers would travel to meet their sisters, or invite their sister's family to their village to celebrate their sister-brother bond with the bounty of seasonal harvests.&lt;ref name=tp/&gt;

Diwali has increasingly attracted cultural exchanges, becoming occasions for politicians and religious leaders worldwide to meet Hindu or Indian origin citizens, diplomatic staff or neighbors. Many participate in other socio-political events as a symbol of support for diversity and inclusiveness.

It began sending official greetings and message to Muslims in 1967 on ''Id al-Fitr''.

===Issues===
====Air pollution====
[[File:AQI 2015 data PM2.5 and PM10 air pollution and Diwali, Delhi India.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|The AQI PM{{sub|2.5}} and PM{{sub|10}} data for air quality from 1 August to 31 December 2015 in Delhi India.&lt;ref&gt;[https://data.gov.in/catalog/historical-daily-ambient-air-quality-data Location wise daily Ambient Air Quality of Delhi for the year 2015], A.B.

The tradition of annual Diwali fireworks has caused widespread coverage in Indian media, where debate has centred on air quality within Indian cities in autumn and winter and the role the fireworks play. On 9 October 2017, the [[Supreme Court of India]] banned the sale, but not use, of fireworks in [[Delhi]] during the Diwali season,&lt;ref name="veconomist" &gt;{{cite news|author=|title=India’s courts take the fun out of a Hindu holiday|url=https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21730189-sales-firecrackers-have-been-banned-delhi-name-public-health-indias-courts-take|work=[[The Economist]]|date=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the assumption that banning the use of fireworks would substantially improve the air quality of Delhi. Critics stated that the ruling was judicial overreach and a bias against Hindu culture, while supporters stated that it would be beneficial to public health.&lt;ref name="veconomist" /&gt;

Scholars have stated that many factors contribute to the poor air quality in Delhi, and northern India, that accompanies the harvest festival of Diwali. According to Jethva and others, the post-monsoon custom is to prepare the crop fields by deliberately burning the residual stubble between October and November.&lt;ref name=Jethva2018/&gt;&lt;ref name="Singh2017"/&gt; As crop productivity per hectare has increased with mechanised harvesting, this has led to the practice becoming more widespread in the northern and northwestern regions of India in the months when Diwali is observed.&lt;ref name=Jethva2018/&gt; The smoke from the burning of the fields is carried by seasonal winds over the floodplain, where it is inverted by the colder winds and spread throughout the region for much of the winter. Other contributors to the poor air quality include daily vehicular and industrial activity along with the burning of other biomass.&lt;ref name=Jethva2018&gt;{{cite journal | last=Jethva | first=Hiren | last2=Chand | first2=Duli | last3=Torres | title=Agricultural Burning and Air Quality over Northern India: A Synergistic Analysis using NASA's A-train Satellite Data and Ground Measurements | journal=Aerosol and Air Quality Research | volume=18 | issue=7 | year=2018 | doi=10.4209/aaqr.2017.12.0583 | pages=1756–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Singh2017"&gt;{{cite book | last=Singh | first=Jabrinder | last2=Singhal | first2=Naveen | last3=Singhal | first3=Shailey | last4=Sharma | title=Advances in Health and Environment Safety | chapter=Environmental Implications of Rice and Wheat Stubble Burning in North-Western States of India | publisher=Springer | year=2017 | isbn=978-981-10-7121-8 | doi=10.1007/978-981-10-7122-5_6 | pages=47–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Shivani, the PM{{sub|2.5}} levels in 2015 and 2016 did rise over Diwali, but these higher levels were "a result of contribution from fireworks on the Diwali night, trans-regional movement of pollutants due to crop residue burning, low wind speed, and high humidity". They also concluded that the contribution of the festival fireworks could lead to a 1.3% increase in the non-carcinogenic hazard index.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Gadi Shivani|author2=M Saxena|journal=Meteorology and Atmospheric Physics| title= Short-term degradation of air quality during major firework events in Delhi, India| year=2018|pp=1–12|doi=10.1007/s00703-018-0602-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have stated that the fireworks of Diwali produce particulates and pollutants with a decay-life time of about one day.{{refn|group=note|According to a study done by Barman in [[Lucknow]], India, the amount of fine (PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;) [[particulates]] in the air can worsen following firework celebrations, but not during it.

====Burn injuries====
{{see also|Fireworks safety}}
The use of fireworks also causes an increase in the number of burn injuries in India during Diwali. One particular firework called ''anar'' (fountain) has been found to be responsible for 65% of such injuries, with adults being the typical victims. Most of the injuries sustained are Group I type burns (minor) requiring only outpatient care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mohan D, Varghese M |title=Fireworks cast a shadow on India's festival of lights |journal=World Health Forum |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=323–26 |year=1990 |pmid=2291800}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ahuja RB, Bhattacharya S |title=Burns in the developing world and burn disasters |journal=BMJ |volume=329 |issue=7463 |pages=447–49 |date=August 2004  |pmid=15321905 |pmc=514214 |doi=10.1136/bmj.329.7463.447}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diwali prayers==
The prayers vary widely by region of India. An example [[Veda|vedic]] prayer from [[Brhadaranyaka Upanishad]] celebrating lights is the [[Pavamana Mantra]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jha |first1=J.

The '''''Exploding Plastic Inevitable''''', sometimes simply called '''''Plastic Inevitable''''' or '''''EPI''''', was a series of [[multimedia]] events organized by [[Andy Warhol]] between 1966 and 1967, featuring musical performances by [[The Velvet Underground]] and [[Nico]], screenings of Warhol's films, and dancing and performances by regulars of Warhol's [[The Factory|Factory]], especially [[Mary Woronov]] and [[Gerard Malanga]]. ''Andy Warhol's Exploding Plastic Inevitable'' is also the title of an 18-minute film by Ronald Nameth with recordings from one week of performances of the shows which were filmed in [[Chicago, Illinois]], in 1966. In December 1966 Warhol included a one-off magazine called ''The Plastic Exploding Inevitable'' as part of the ''[[Aspen (magazine)|Aspen]]'' No. 3 package.&lt;ref name=Aspen&gt;{{Cite journal|title=From the research laboratories of Andy Warhol comes this issue of Aspen Magazine |date=April 1967 |url=http://www.ubu.com/aspen/advertisements/aspen3Ad.html |journal=[[Evergreen Review]] |volume=11 |issue=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Warhol's Exploding Plastic Inevitable with Nico.png|thumb|left|170px|Performance of Exploding Plastic Inevitable in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]]]]
The ''Exploding Plastic Inevitable'' had its beginnings in an event staged on January 13, 1966, at a dinner for the New York Society for Clinical Psychiatry. This event, called "Up-Tight", included performances by the Velvet Underground and Nico, along with Malanga and [[Edie Sedgwick]] as dancers&lt;ref name=BWJ&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Branden W. |last=Joseph |authorlink=Branden W.

==Legacy==
{{unsourced section|date=January 2017}}
[[Andy Warhol]]'s lights engineer Danny Williams pioneered many innovations that have since become standard practice in rock music light shows. From May 27–29 the '''''EPI''''' played [[The Fillmore]] in San Francisco, where Williams built a light show including [[stroboscope|stroboscopes]], slides and film projections onstage. At [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]]'s request he was soon to come back and build more. Film maker [[Jonas Mekas]] (who pioneered film projections during concerts at New York's Cinematheque), Andy Warhol and Danny Williams' influential ideas contributed much to the legendary Fillmore Auditorium's prestige and were also used at the [[Fillmore East]] and [[Fillmore West]], both opening in 1968.

'''Floriade 1972''' was a [[garden festival]] held in [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]] following its recognition by the [[Bureau International des Expositions]] (BIE). The 1972 exposition was the fifth edition of the international [[horticultural exposition]] organised under the auspices of the Association of International Horticultural Producers ([[AIPH]]) and the second [[Floriade (Netherlands)|Floriade]] in the Netherlands. The first Amsterdam Floriade lasted from March 30 to October 1, 1972.

The exposition was held at the newly created [[Amstelpark]] and Beatrix Park. The landscaped grounds at Amstelpark covered 700.000m². Beatrix Park, part of the [[Amsterdam RAI Exhibition and Convention Centre]] and a portion of the embankment on which later the ring road south and the [[Amsterdam RAI railway station]] were built, was part of the Floriade. The sites were connected by a cable car and carts. A narrow gauge railway and Ferris wheel were also built at Amstelpark.

After the closure of the Floriade, much of the amenities that were built for the event remained at Amstelpark. These included the Amstel train (a narrow-gauge railway ), a maze, a rose garden, an [[orangery]], the Glass House, greenhouses, a miniature golf course, the [[Rhododendron]] Valley, The Abandoned land, Galerie Papillon Park and a large playground for children.

'''Galicia–Volhynia Wars''' were several wars fought in the years 1340–1392 over the succession in the [[Galicia–Volhynia|Principality of Galicia–Volhynia]] (in modern Poland and Ukraine). After [[Boleslaw-Yuri II of Galicia|Boleslaw-Yuri II]] was poisoned by local nobles in 1340, both [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] and [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)|Kingdom of Poland]] advanced claims over the principality. After a prolonged conflict, Galicia–Volhynia was divided between Poland ([[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]]) and Lithuania ([[Volhynia]]) and the principality ceased to exist as an independent state. Poland acquired a territory of approximately {{convert|52000|km2}} with 200,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref name=sub&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HNIs9O3EmtQC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a |title=Ukraine: A History |first=Orest |last=Subtelny |edition=3rd (illustrated) |publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=2000 |isbn=0-8020-8390-0 |page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Brothers [[Andrew of Galicia|Andrew]] and [[Lev II of Galicia|Lev II]] died ca. 1322, leaving no male successor in Galicia–Volhynia. Instead of promoting his son [[Liubartas]] (who was married to Andrew's daughter) and causing a war with Poland, [[Gediminas of Lithuania]] compromised with [[Władysław I of Poland]].&lt;ref name=rowell224/&gt; Both parties agreed to install fourteen-year-old [[Boleslaw-Yuri II of Galicia|Boleslaw-Yuri II]], nephew of Lev and Andrew. Boleslaw-Yuri was a son of [[Trojden I of Masovia]] from the [[Piast dynasty]], a cousin of Władysław I and nephew of Gediminas' son-in-law [[Wenceslaus of Płock]].&lt;ref name=rowell224&gt;{{cite book | title=Lithuania Ascending: A Pagan Empire Within East-Central Europe, 1295-1345 | first=C. S. | last=Rowell | year=1994 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | series=Cambridge Studies in Medieval Life and Thought: Fourth Series| isbn=978-0-521-45011-9 | page=224 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To strengthen the compromise, Boleslaw was [[Betrothal|betrothed]] to Eufemija, daughter of Gediminas. Boleslaw was poisoned in April 1340 by local nobles who resented growing Polish and Bohemian influence in the court.&lt;ref name=rowell266&gt;{{cite book | title=Lithuania Ascending: A Pagan Empire Within East-Central Europe, 1295-1345 | first=C. S. | last=Rowell | year=1994 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | series=Cambridge Studies in Medieval Life and Thought: Fourth Series| isbn=978-0-521-45011-9 | pages=266–269 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Boleslaw did not have an heir and his death upset fragile power balance in the region.

==Conflicts==
===First stage===
Within days of Boleslaw's murder, [[Casimir III of Poland]] invaded the principality to save Polish merchants and Catholic residents from attacks in [[Lviv]].&lt;ref name=rowell266/&gt; In June 1340, Casimir returned with a larger army. After four weeks he reached an agreement with local nobles and their leader [[Dmytro Dedko]]: in return for their services, local nobles would enjoy protection from the Polish king.&lt;ref name=rowell266/&gt; However, the agreement was short-lived. The data is sparse, but it seems that Galicia–Volhynia was divided between the Lithuanians (Liubartas ruled in Volhynia and its chief city [[Volodymyr-Volynskyi]]) and local nobles (Detko ruled Galicia).&lt;ref name=rowell266/&gt; During the winter 1340–1341, the [[Golden Horde]] (probably with Lithuanian help) attacked Poland and reached [[Lublin]] as a result of diminished tribute from the principality to the Mongol khan.&lt;ref name=rowell266/&gt; The raid weakened Polish influence in the principality. Eufemija, Boleslaw's widow, was drowned in the [[Vistula]] in winter 1342 to keep her out of the succession disputes.&lt;ref name=rowell266/&gt; Detko, who managed to play Poles, Lithuanians, and Mongols against each other, disappeared from written sources in 1344. The same year direct conflict between Poland and Lithuania renewed, but soon a peace treaty was signed: Volhynia was assigned to Liubartas and Galicia to Casimir.&lt;ref name=zen&gt;{{cite book |first=Zenonas |last=Ivinskis |title=Lietuvos istorija iki Vytauto Didžiojo mirties |year=1978 |location=Rome |publisher=Lietuvių katalikų mokslo akademija |language=lt |id={{LCC|79346776}} |pages=267–269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second stage===
After the Lithuanians were defeated in the [[Battle of Strėva]] by the [[Teutonic Knights]] in 1348,&lt;ref name=dv&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LACpYP-g1y8C&amp;pg=PA77&amp;as_brr=3 | title=The Slavs in European History and Civilization |first=Francis |last=Dvornik |edition=3rd (illustrated) |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=1992 |isbn=0-8135-0799-5 |page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liubartas lost all territories except for eastern [[Volhynia]] with Lutsk to Casimir and his ally [[Louis I of Hungary]] (Louis was promised the territories if Casimir died without an heir).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vEJNBqanT_8C&amp;pg=PA167&amp;as_brr=3 |title=The Realm of St. Stephen: A History of Medieval Hungary, 895–1526 | first=Pál |last=Engel |author2=Pal Engel |author3=Tamás Pálosfalvi |author4=Andrew Ayton  |edition=illustrated |publisher=I.B.Tauris |year=2005 |isbn=1-85043-977-X |page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liubartas' brothers [[Algirdas]] and [[Kęstutis]] organized several expeditions to Poland and [[Red Ruthenia]]. Lithuanians allied themselves with [[Muscovy]]: Liubartas married an unnamed daughter of Konstantin of [[Rostov]], a relative of [[Simeon of Moscow]],&lt;ref name=jasas&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | first=Rimantas | last=Jasas | editor=Vytautas Spečiūnas | encyclopedia=Lietuvos valdovai (XIII-XVIII a.): enciklopedinis žinynas | title=Liubartas | year=2004 | publisher=Mokslo ir enciklopedijų leidybos institutas | location=Vilnius | isbn=5-420-01535-8 | page=44|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Algirdas married [[Uliana of Tver]], sister-in-law of Simeon.&lt;ref name=zen/&gt; In spring 1351, Lubartas was taken prisoner by Louis, but was released in summer after a truce was agreed upon with Kęstutis.&lt;ref name=zen/&gt; The deal fell through and more military attacks followed in 1352. Another truce, rather favorable to the Lithuanians, was signed in fall 1352: Lubartas received not only Volhynia and [[Podolia]], but also [[Belz]] and [[Chełm]].&lt;ref name=zen/&gt; However, already in 1353, Liubartas attacked again. Casimir responded by organizing a large campaign against the [[Lithuanian mythology|pagan Lithuanians]] with a special permission from [[Pope Innocent VI]].&lt;ref name=zen/&gt; After the campaign did not achieve the desired results, Casimir contemplated an alliance with the Lithuanians.

In 1366, Casimir, allied with [[Siemowit III of Masovia]] and nephews of Liubartas, resumed the war. As Algirdas was involved in conflicts in the east and Kęstutis fought with the Teutonic Knights, Liubartas had to defend alone and was defeated.&lt;ref name=zen/&gt; In fall 1366, a treaty was signed: Liubartas retained only eastern Volhynia with Lutsk and became somewhat dependent on Poland (he had to retain neutrality in case Poland attacked Lithuania).&lt;ref name=zen/&gt; Casimir awarded his allies: Yuri, son of [[Karijotas]], received [[Chełm]], his brother Alexander received [[Volodymyr-Volynskyi]], and Yuri, son of [[Narimantas]], continued to rule [[Belz]].&lt;ref name=zen/&gt;

===Third stage===
In 1370, Liubartas took advantage of Casimir's death and captured all of Volhynia, including Volodymyr-Volynskyi.&lt;ref name=el&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | editor=Simas Sužiedėlis | encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia Lituanica]] | title=Liubartas | year=1970–1978 | publisher=Juozas Kapočius | volume=III | location=Boston, Massachusetts | id={{LCC | 74-114275}} | pages=411–412}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1370 and 1387 Galicia was ruled by the Hungarian crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RG9dXs3-zQEC&amp;pg=PA185&amp;as_brr=3 |title=Galicia: A Multicultured Land |first=C.

Magocsi|edition=illustrated |publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=2005 |isbn=0-8020-3781-X| page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; Louis of Hungary appointed [[Władysław Opolczyk]] as his regent in the region. In 1376 the war resumed: Liubartas, Kęstutis, and Yuri of Belz attacked [[Sandomierz]] and [[Tarnów]], reaching as far as [[Kraków]] and taking many prisoners.&lt;ref name=zen/&gt; After retaliation by Louis, Liubartas had to swear loyalty to Hungary as his sons were taken hostage.&lt;ref name=zen/&gt; Liubartas could expect little help from Lithuania as his brother Algirdas died in 1377. In 1378 Louis attached Galicia directly to the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. After Louis death in 1382, Liubartas captured castles ruled by Hungarians (including [[Kremenets]] and [[Przemyśl]]),&lt;ref name=jasas/&gt; but did not renew a full-scale war.&lt;ref name=zen/&gt; At the time Lithuania, Poland, and Hungary, all three main contenders for the former Galicia–Volhynia, were engulfed in dynastic succession disputes. Polish nobles crowned Hungarian [[Jadwiga of Poland]] as their king and invited Lithuanian [[Jogaila]] to become her husband. Jadwiga and Jogaila signed the [[Union of Krewo]] in 1385, creating a [[personal union]] between Poland and Lithuania. In 1387, Jadwiga attached Galicia to Poland for good.&lt;ref name=sub/&gt;

Liubartas died ca. 1384 and his throne was inherited by his son Fëdor. Jogaila started limiting Fëdor's sovereignty in Volhynia. Jogaila, hoping to reconcile with his cousin [[Vytautas]] after the [[Lithuanian Civil War (1381–84)]] even promised Lutsk and Volodymyr-Volynskyi to Vytautas.&lt;ref name=vald&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | first=Edvardas | last=Gudavičius | authorlink=Edvardas Gudavičius | editor=Vytautas Spečiūnas | encyclopedia=Lietuvos valdovai (XIII-XVIII a.): enciklopedinis žinynas | title=Vytautas Didysis | year=2004 | publisher=Mokslo ir enciklopedijų leidybos institutas | location=Vilnius | isbn=5-420-01535-8 | pages=79–80|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, that did not appease Vytautas, who sought to regain his patrimony in [[Trakai]] and gain power in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and he started the [[Lithuanian Civil War (1389–92)]]. The civil war ended with the [[Ostrów Agreement]] of 1392, which settled Galician–Volhynian issue for good: Poland took Galicia adopting title ''Dei gratia rex Polonie et '''Russie''', nec non Cracovie, Sandomirie, Siradie, Lancicie, Cuiavie, et Pomeranieque Terrarum et Ducatuum Dominus et Heres'', while Lithuania controlled Volhynia.

The '''Gillian Lynne Theatre''' (formerly '''New London Theatre''') is a [[West End theatre]] located on the corner of [[Drury Lane]] and Parker Street in [[Covent Garden]], in the [[London Borough of Camden]]. The '''Winter Garden Theatre''' formerly occupied the site until 1965. On 14 March 2018, [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] announced that the theatre would be renamed ''The Gillian Lynne Theatre'' later in the year, in honour of [[Gillian Lynne]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bestoftheatre.co.uk/blog/post/new-london-gillian-lynne New London Theatre to be renamed the Gillian Lynne Theatre] accessed 15 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The name officially changed on 1 May 2018. It is the first theatre in the [[West End of London]] to be named after a non-royal woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-44574889 |title=West End theatre renamed after Cats choreographer Gillian Lynne - BBC News |website=Bbc.com |date= |accessdate=2018-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The modern theatre is built on the site of previous taverns and [[music hall]] theatres, where a place of entertainment has been located since [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] times. [[Nell Gwynn]] was associated with the tavern, which became known as the ''Great Mogul'' by the end of the 17th century, and presented entertainments in an adjoining hall, including "glee clubs" and "sing-songs".  The ''Mogul Saloon'' was built on the site in 1847, which was sometimes known as the "Turkish Saloon or the "Mogul Music Hall."  In 1851, it became the '''Middlesex Music Hall''', known as ''The Old Mo''. This in turn was rebuilt as the ''New Middlesex Theatre of Varieties'', in 1911 by [[Frank Matcham]] for [[Oswald Stoll]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.str.org.uk/research/interests/interests/c.html#cruickshank|title=STR Research: Interests C|website=Str.org.uk|accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919, the theatre was sold to [[George Grossmith, Jr.]] and [[Edward Laurillard]], refurbished and reopened as the '''Winter Garden Theatre'''. They produced ''[[Kissing Time]]'' (1919, with a book by [[P. G. Wodehouse]] and [[Guy Bolton]] and music by [[Ivan Caryll]]), followed by ''[[A Night Out (musical)|A Night Out]]'' (1920), both starring [[Stanley Holloway]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanley Holloway#Musical, theatre and concert party credits]]&lt;/ref&gt; Grossmith and Laurillard also became managers of the [[Apollo Theatre]] in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nimaxtheatres.com/nimax/apollo-theatore|title=Information about their management of the Apollo Theatre. Date accessed: 20 October 2007.|website=Nimaxtheatres.com|accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; But expanding their operation caused Grossmith and Laurillard to end their partnership, with Grossmith retaining control of the Winter Garden.&lt;ref name=Ganzl&gt;Gänzl, Kurt. "Grossmith, George (1874–1935)" in the ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press (2004) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/33591, accessed 21 Oct 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

Grossmith then partnered with [[George Edwardes]]'s former associate, Pat Malone, to produce a series of mostly adaptations of imported shows at the Winter Garden between 1920 and 1926: ''[[Sally (musical)|Sally]]'' (1921), ''The Cabaret Girl'' (1922, with book by Wodehouse and music by [[Jerome Kern]]), ''The Beauty Prize'' (1923, with Wodehouse and Kern), a revival of ''[[To-Night's the Night (musical)|Tonight's the Night]]'' (1923), ''[[Primrose (musical)|Primrose]]'' (1924, with music by [[George Gershwin]]), ''Tell Me More'' (1925, with words by Thompson and music by George Gershwin)&lt;ref&gt;''Tell Me More'' review in ''The Times'', 27 May 1925 p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Kid Boots'' (1926 with music by Harry Tierney),&lt;ref&gt;''Kid Boots'' review in ''The Times'' 3 February 1926, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; many of them featuring [[Leslie Henson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/british/authors/grossmith.html|title=Biography of George Grossmith, Jr. containing information about the Winter Garden Theatre's productions from 1919 - 1926|website=Math.boisestate.edu|accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grossmith co-wrote some of the Winter Garden pieces, directed many of his own productions and starred in several, notably as Otis in ''Sally''. Several of the later productions lost money, and Grossmith and Malone ended the partnership.&lt;ref name=Ganzl/&gt;

''[[The Vagabond King]]'' was produced at the theatre in 1927, and in 1929, [[Fred Astaire|Fred]] and [[Adele Astaire]] starred in ''[[Funny Face]]''. In 1930, [[Sophie Tucker]] played in the Vivian Ellis musical ''Follow a Star'', and in 1923, Gracie Fields appeared here in ''Walk This Way''. In 1933, the theatre hosted Lewis Casson in [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''On the Rocks'', followed in 1935 by ''Love on the Dole'', starring Wendy Hiller. The theatre closed in the late 1930s, reopening in 1942. In 1945, it hosted a [[Donald Wolfit]] season, and in 1953, [[Agatha Christie]]'s ''Witness for the Prosecution'' played. 1956 saw ''The Water Gypsies'' by Vivian Ellis and A P Herbert; ''Hotel Paradiso'' starring [[Alec Guinness]], [[Douglas Byng]], [[Irene Worth]] and [[Billie Whitelaw]]; and [[Tyrone Power]] starred in Shaw's ''The Devil Disciple''. 1958 included ''[[The Iceman Cometh]]''.&lt;ref name=timeline&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travel.ciao.co.uk/New_London_London__Review_5500603|title=Timeline of the theatre|website=Travel.coao.co.uk|accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre closed permanently in 1959&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andreas-praefcke.de/carthalia/uk/uk_london_newlondon.htm|title=Carthalia - London: Gillian Lynne Theatre|website=Andreas-praefcke.de|accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; when it was sold by the Rank Organisation to a developer.&lt;ref name=timeline/&gt; It was then gutted and remained vacant until 1965 to be replaced in 1973 by the current building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/NewLondonTheatre.htm|title=The New London Theatre / Gillian Lynne Theatre, Drury Lane and Parker Street, London|website=Arthurlloyd.co.uk|accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Designed by architect Paul Tvrtkovic and scenic designer [[Sean Kenny (theatre designer)|Sean Kenny]] (''[[Blitz!]]'', ''[[Oliver!]]'', ''[[Pickwick (musical)]]''), modelled after the Walter Gropius Total-Theater, and seating 960 on 2 levels, the theatre's auditorium first opened with a television recording of [[Marlene Dietrich]]'s one-woman show.&lt;ref name=thisistheatre&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisistheatre.com/londontheatre/newlondontheatre.html|title=New London Theatre London - information and tickets|website=Thisistheatre.com|accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre officially opened on 2 January 1973 with a production of ''The Unknown Soldier and His Wife'' starring [[Peter Ustinov]]. It then hosted ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]'', starring [[Richard Gere]] as Danny. Beginning in 1977, the theatre was used as a television studio for several years and then returned to use as a theatre.&lt;ref name=thisistheatre/&gt; The theatre's biggest hit was the [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] and [[Trevor Nunn]] [[musical theater|musical]] ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'', choreographed by [[Gillian Lynne]] which premièred in the theatre on 11 May 1981. Closing in 2002, this production became the longest running musical in West End history.

The theatre also hosted the 1977 [[BBC Sports Personality of the Year]] and the [[Masters (snooker)|Masters]] snooker between 1976 and 1978. Also in 1977, the theatre hosted the [[BBC]]'s ''[[A Song For Europe]]'' contest, the preliminary heat to choose the UK entry for the ''[[Eurovision Song Contest]]''. However, the show was blacked out on TV due to a last minute strike by technicians. The famous video clip for the song ''We Are The Champions'' by the band [[Queen (band)|Queen]] was shot there on October 1977, which followed a minor 70-min. concert.

Between 2003 and 2005 the theatre hosted Bill Kenwright's revival of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical, ''[[Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat]]''. This closed after a two and a half year run on 3 September 2005. Most recently, the venue played host to the London transfer of the [[off-Broadway]] production, ''[[Blue Man Group]]'', which closed in June 2007, to make way for the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]]'s repertory productions of ''[[The Seagull]]'' and ''[[King Lear]]'', starring [[Ian McKellen]]. In Spring 2008, a new musical adaptation of ''Gone With The Wind'' ran for only two month. New musical [[Imagine This]] closed after only being open for one month.

The National Theatre production of ''[[War Horse (play)|War Horse]]'' transferred into the theatre from the 28 March 2009 where it stayed until 12 March 2016 after over 3,000 performances.

The theatre was home to the [[Crucible Theatre|Sheffield Cruicible]]'s production of the musical ''[[Show Boat]]'' which opened on 9 April 2016. Despite positive reviews, the production closed early, on 27 August 2016. On 22 October 2016 the London production of [[Andrew Lloyd Webber|Andrew Lloyd Webber's]] ''[[School of Rock (musical)|School of Rock]]'' the musical opened, direct from Broadway.

The theatre has been owned since 1991 by Lloyd Webber's [[Really Useful Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rutheatres.com/|title=LW Theatres - Book tickets from the official website|website=LW Theatres|accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre building also contains an underground car park, a cabaret venue, a basement nightclub, shops and a residential tower.&lt;ref name="timeline" /&gt; In 2014, Lloyd Webber reorganized the group; the entity that owns the theatre is Really Useful Theatres.&lt;ref&gt;Dennys, Harriet.

[[File:Hotaru no Hikari(Auld lang syne in Japan).ogg|thumb|Japanese song ''Hotaru no hikari'', based on the melody of ''[[Auld Lang Syne]]''. 1m00s]]

{{nihongo||蛍の光|'''Hotaru no Hikari'''|extra=meaning "Glow of a firefly"}} is a Japanese song incorporating the tune of Scottish folk song ''[[Auld Lang Syne]]'' with completely different lyrics by Chikai Inagaki, first introduced in a collection of singing songs for elementary school students in 1881 (Meiji 14). The swapping of lyrics without substantial change to the music is known as [[contrafactum]]. The words describe a series of images of hardships that the industrious student endures in his relentless quest for knowledge, starting with the [[firefly]]’s light, which the student uses to keep studying when he has no other light sources. It is commonly heard during graduation ceremonies and at the end of the school day. Many stores and restaurants play it to usher customers out at the end of a business day. On the very popular Japanese New Year's Eve TV show, [[NHK]] ''[[Kōhaku Uta Gassen]]'', it has become a tradition for all the performers to sing ''Hotaru no Hikari'' as the last song. Another Western song reworked in the same period (late 19th century) and also used at graduation ceremonies is "[[Aogeba Tōtoshi]]".

'''The Huck Finn Jubilee Bluegrass Music Festival''' or simply '''The Huck Finn Jubilee''' is an annual three-day bluegrass event held in [[Ontario, California]]. It is held during the second weekend in June at the Cucamonga-Guasti Regional Park and features RV and tent camping, traditional "Americana" activities, and live bluegrass music. The festival also features activities, such as greased pole climbing, tomahawk throwing, pie eating, [[river rafting]], and arts and crafts. The event is also the West Coast’s biggest [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] festival, with acts such as [[The String Cheese Incident]], [[Ralph Stanley]], [[Steve Martin]] &amp; the [[Steep Canyon Rangers]], and [[Rhonda Vincent]].&lt;ref name="db1"/&gt;  On September 30, 2016 the Greater Ontario Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau announced that 2016 would be the last festival sponsored by it at the Cucamonga-Guasti Regional Park.&lt;ref&gt;https://huckfinn.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The history of the Jubilee began in [[Norco, California]] in the early 70's. Tuckers,  David "Russ" and Maureen Russell, Steve and Sandy Perault and Christianson each had a hand in making it a success before it ever moved to and including Victorville.

The Huck Finn Jubilee Bluegrass Music Festival was founded by Don Tucker and his family in 1976 and was eventually held at the Mojave Narrows Regional Park in [[Victorville, California]], on [[Father’s Day]] weekend. The festival, which at first featured mostly local talent as the bluegrass entertainment, achieved success in its first few years, with attendance as high as 7,000.

In 1989, Bobby Osborne of bluegrass duo [[The Osborne Brothers]] called Tucker to ask if he would book them for Friday night, as they were "stuck on the West Coast". In the following years after their performance at the Huck Finn Jubilee Bluegrass Music Festival, Tucker began booking national talent such as [[The Country Gentlemen]], [[The Seldom Scene]], [[Jimmy Martin]], [[J.D. Crowe]], [[Larry Sparks]], [[Tony Rice]], [[Earl Scruggs]], [[Ricky Skaggs]], [[Lonesome River Band]], among others. In 2001, the Huck Finn Jubilee was named the bluegrass event of the year by the [[International Bluegrass Music Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.redlandsdailyfacts.com/general-news/20130608/get-your-huck-finn-jubilee-on-at-cucamonga-guasti-regional-park&amp;template=printart | title=Get your Huck Finn Jubilee on at Cucamonga-Guasti Regional Park | publisher=[[Redlands Daily Facts]] | date=7 July 2013 | accessdate=1 January 2015 | author=Nolan, Michel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://ibma.org/awards/recipient-history | title=Bluegrass Event of the Year | publisher=IBMA | accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Don Tucker died in 2012, the festival moved to Cucamonga-Guasti Regional Park in Ontario, California, for the following year. In May 2014, Michael Krouse and the Greater Ontario Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau acquired the festival to ensure its continuation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://huckfinn.com/huck-finn-jubilee-finds-permanent-home-in-ontario-california/ | title=Huck Finn Jubilee Finds Permanent Home in Ontario, California | publisher=Huck Finn Jubilee | date=24 January 2014 | accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://bluegrasstoday.com/huck-finn-festival-under-new-management/ | title=Huck Finn festival under new management | publisher=Bluegrass Today | date=22 May 2014 | accessdate=27 January 2015 | author=Lawless, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, Huck Finn Jubilee officials announced that starting in 2015, the festival will be held annually during the second weekend in June to facilitate event planning and avoid potential conflict with the [[Telluride Bluegrass Festival]], which is held the third weekend in June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cybergrass.com/node/4229 | title=Huck Finn Jubilee Announces New Dates for 2015 and Beyond | publisher=CyberGrass | date=30 November 2014 | accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.discoverontariocalifornia.org/latest-news/huck-finn-jubilee-adopts-fixed-calendar | title=Huck Finn Jubilee Adopts Fixed Calendar | publisher=Discover Ontario, California | accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Icelandic presidential elections''' determine who serves as president of the Republic of Iceland for four-year terms. The mandate of the current president, [[Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson]], expired in the summer of 2016. [[Guðni Th. Jóhannesson]] won the presidential election, which was held on June 28, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Guðni Jóhannesson wins Iceland’s presidential election|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/26/history-professor-gudni-johannesson-wins-iceland-presidential-election|accessdate=31 August 2016|publisher=The Guardian|date=June 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is common for there only to be one candidate declared at the time of the closure of nominations, normally the incumbent president, in which case no election is held and the incumbent is declared to be re-elected. This has happened in 1956, 1960, 1964, 1972, 1976, 1984, 1992, 2000, and 2008.

'''Irvin S. "Kip" Kipper''', (November 13, 1916 – April 21, 2016) was an American Air Force bomber pilot, prisoner of war, and the founder and namesake of [[Kip's Toyland]], the oldest toy store in Los Angeles, located in the Farmer's Market since 1945.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/latimes/obituary.aspx?pid=179719939&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-lopez-kip-20151014-column.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishjournal.com/50_Plus/article/at_95_kips_toyland_owner_ready_for_more_fun_and_games_20111221&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Irvin Kipper was born in [[Fort Worth, Texas]], on November 13, 1916, and his family moved to Los Angeles in 1920. In 1944, he enlisted in the US Army Air Corps, ultimately becoming an officer and pilot of the [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] during [[World War II]]. While flying in Europe, Kipper named his B-17 "Purdy Gertie", after his wife, Gertrude.

==Army service==
On his 26th mission, Kipper was shot down over [[Bologna Italy|Bologna]], where he was captured and spent more than seven months as a Nazi prisoner of war in the POW camps [[Stalag Luft III]] (celebrated in books, TV and film for "the Great Escape") and Stalag VII.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/latimes/obituary.aspx?pid=179719939|title=Obituary Irvin S. Kipper|last=|first=|date=|website=Los Angeles Times|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kipper's camp was liberated by troops of [[George S. Patton]] in August 1945.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/latimes/obituary.aspx?pid=179719939&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
When Kipper returned to Los Angeles after the war, he purchased a small store to sell flags. He then added balloons, which were a big hit, because rubber was rationed during the war. Then he added [[Slinky]], board games, [[Lincoln Logs]], [[Tinkertoy]] sets, Carrom Game Boards, and new toys as they were invented.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-lopez-kip-20151014-column.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[FAO Schwarz]] opened up a short distance from Kip's Toyland, but they went out of business and Kip's Toyland is still flourishing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9118">'''"Koreagate"''' was an [[United States|American]] [[political scandal]] in 1976 involving [[South Korea]]n political figures seeking influence from 10 Democratic members of Congress. An immediate goal of the scandal seems to have been reversing President [[Richard Nixon]]'s decision to withdraw troops from South Korea. It involved the [[National Intelligence Service (South Korea)|Korea Central Intelligence Agency]] (KCIA) allegedly funneling bribes and favors through Korean businessman [[Tongsun Park]] in an attempt to gain favor and influence for South Korean objectives.&lt;ref name="Boettcher, Robert B. 1980"&gt;Boettcher, Robert B. (1980). ''Gifts of Deceit''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mitpress.mit.edu"&gt;Irving Louis Horowitz, [http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=6720&amp;mode=toc Science, Sin, and Society: The Politics or Reverend Moon and the Unification Church] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211142618/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=6720&amp;mode=toc |date=2008-12-11 }}, 1980, MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldhistory.biz/modern-history/84266-koreagate.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parties involved==
Tongsun Park and U.S. Congressman [[Richard T. Hanna]] (D-CA) were two of the main actors involved in the Koreagate scandal. Tongsun Park represented the Korean side of the secret agreement, while Richard Hanna was largely responsible for the American side of the deal. According to the agreement, both parties would share the commissions from American rice sales to South Korea and to use them to obtain favorable decisions for Seoul in the United States Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Chae. J. Lee dynamics of adjustment, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; Hanna was also responsible for aiding [[Chung Il Kwon]] and Park in finding effective lobbying techniques, which he did by advising the pair to emulate [[Taiwan]]ese and [[Israel]]i models that had succeeded in the past.&lt;ref&gt;Lee koreagate investigations, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; Park was also responsible for providing extra financial incentives to Hanna and other members of Congress, a task made easy by large rice sale commissions.&lt;ref&gt;''Koreagate on Capitol Hill'' Time, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Such financial incentives reportedly ranged from US$100,000 to $200,000 at a time per individual. Some 115 members of Congress were supposedly involved.  Speculation also focused on the role of [[Unification Church]] founder [[Sun Myung Moon]], former KCIA Director [[Kim Hyong-uk]], and former South Korean Prime Minister [[Chung Il-kwon]].&lt;ref name="Boettcher, Robert B. 1980"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mitpress.mit.edu"/&gt;

==Objectives==
The reasons behind the scandal involved political, social, and financial motivations. Korean leaders, including Tongsun Park and President Park, were angered with Nixon's decision to withdraw soldiers from South Korea and felt it was urgent to build support for preserving the remaining United States military presence.&lt;ref&gt;C. Lee political notions of scandal, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; The Park government was also concerned with the approval of a substantial package of assistance for South Korea's military modernization programs.&lt;ref&gt;C. Lee financial notions of scandal p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Another reason behind the scandal was to repress or counter increasing criticism of Park's illegitimate policies and human rights violations.&lt;ref&gt;C. Lee Social Notions of Scandal p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; According to many, the deceitfulness of Park's objectives would ultimately lead to his downfall.&lt;ref&gt;''Koreagate on Capitol Hill'' Time p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==
The [[United States Department of State]] recognized the illegal aspects of Park's action in 1970 and informed the Korean embassy in Washington that such activities were problematic.&lt;ref&gt;Lee ''A Troubled Peace'' reactions to actions p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Former United States Ambassador to the Republic of Korea [[William J. Porter|William Porter]] tried to persuade South Korean President [[Park Chung-hee]] and Chung Il Kwon that Tongsun Park should have to return to South Korea, but to no avail.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Porter's concern on ethics p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, William Porter described the United States response as "greatly pessimistic" because the United States government did not want to denounce South Korea when it was assisting war efforts in [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;Purdum Government bias to withhold punishment p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the replacement of William Porter by [[Philip Habib]] as ambassador to South Korea, punishment for Tongsun Park's unethical activities was increasingly pursued.&lt;ref&gt;Unethical description of behavior Time p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Habib attempted to force Park to register as a lobbyist for the South Korean government, but was unsuccessful. In response to his failure, Habib instructed all embassy personnel in South Korea to cut ties with Park and warned several visiting congressmen about his illegal operations, only to be crossed by former Attorney General [[William B. Saxbe|William Saxbe]] who warned Park of these actions and his potential prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;Lee ''A Troubled Peace'' p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after Porter and Habib's attempts to condemn Tongsun Park's actions, Habib accepted another job opportunity which forced him to work abroad for three years,&lt;ref&gt;Lee Consequences on hold p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; which once again left Park's fate uncertain.

==Diplomatic relations==

After Koreagate was publicized, political relations between the United States and South Korea became shaky at best. Animosity between the United States and South Korea was further aggravated by mutual misperceptions and procedural disagreements.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Dynamics of Structural Adjustment p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States adopted a legalistic platform and expected South Korea to cooperate with any pending investigations.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Koreagate Investigations p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, South Korean officials believed the story had been exaggerated, spun, or even concocted by American journalists.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Lee Diplomatic Sparring p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, South Korea interpreted American action as arising from an anti-Park conspiracy.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; Political experts on both sides also suspected that the scandal was being framed in this manner to aid [[Gerald Ford]]'s election strategy. According to this interpretation, the Ford administration intended to neutralize the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]'s exploitation of [[Watergate]] and Ford's pardon of [[Richard Nixon]] as issues by linking key Democratic congressmen to the Koreagate operations.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Diplomatic Sparring p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
Despite persistent disagreement about [[extradition]] between the United States and South Korea, Tongsun Park ultimately came to the United States in April 1978 to testify publicly in a House hearing.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Dobbs on Koreagate p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; During the testimony, Park admitted to disbursing cash to thirty members of Congress.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Ten members of Congress were implicated, of whom most decided to resign, while the statute of limitations expired for three. Park was granted full immunity for his testimony.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Congressional members [[Edward Roybal]] (D-CA), [[Charles H. Wilson]] (D-CA) and [[John J. McFall]] (D-CA) were censured and reprimanded;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Dobbs Congressional Bad Boys p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Congressman [[Edward J. Patten]] (D-NJ) was found not guilty, and [[Otto Passman]] (D-LA) was indicted on bribery, conspiracy, illegal gratuities and tax evasion.  He was tried in his home district in Monroe, Louisiana and was acquitted.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Richard Hanna was convicted and sentenced to six to thirty months in prison.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The '''Museum of Failure'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://museumoffailure.se/ |title=About |website=Museumoffailure.se |date= |accessdate=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a collection of failed products and services. The museum showcases failures to provide visitors a learning experience about the important role of [[failure]] for [[innovation]] and to encourage organizations to become better at learning from failure. The exhibition opened on June 7, 2017 in [[Helsingborg]], [[Sweden]].&lt;ref name=WaPo&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/kidspost/swedens-museum-of-failure-highlights-products-that-flopped/2017/06/12/3f24cd48-4ba7-11e7-9669-250d0b15f83b_story.html |title=Sweden's Museum of Failure highlights products that flopped |work=[[Washington Post]] |date=June 12, 2017 |accessdate=June 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibit re-opened at [[Dunker Culture House|Dunkers Kulturhus]] on June 2, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dunkerskulturhus.se/utstallningar/miss-lyckat-by-museum-of-failure/|title=MISS LYCKAT by Museum of Failure {{!}} Dunkers kulturhus|website=dunkerskulturhus.se|language=sv-SE|access-date=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A temporary exhibit opened in Los Angeles in December 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://failuremuseum.com/event/ad-architecture-design-museum/A pop-up version of the museum is on an international tour.&lt;/ref&gt; The Los Angeles museum is on Hollywood Blvd. in the Hollywood &amp; Highland Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.welikela.com/the-museum-of-failure-at-hollywood-highland/|title=The Museum of Failure Has a New Home at Hollywood &amp; Highland|date=2018-03-08|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The growing collection consists of over seventy failed products and services from around the world. Every item provides insight into the risky business of innovation. Some examples of the items on display: [[MessagePad|Apple Newton]], [[Bic Cristal#Bic Cristal for Her|Bic for Her]], [[Google Glass]], [[N-Gage (device)|N-Gage]], [[Orbitoclast|lobotomy instruments]], Harley-Davidson Cologne, [[Kodak DC Series|Kodak DC-40]], [[Videotape format war|Sony Betamax]], Lego Fiber Optics and [[Paolo Macchiarini]]'s infamous plastic [[trachea]].

The museum has received international attention for its unusual collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/956795/swedens-museum-of-failure-a-spectacular-catalogue-of-the-worlds-worst-innovations/ |title=The Museum of Failure in Sweden argues that real innovation requires failure — Quartz |website=Qz.com |date=2017-04-13 |accessdate=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vonberg |first=Judith |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/04/06/europe/museum-of-failure-sweden/ |title=Museum showcases innovation failures |website=Edition.cnn.com | publisher=[[CNN]] | date=2017-04-06 |accessdate=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-thursday-edition-1.4058508/the-museum-of-failure-showcases-and-celebrates-really-terrible-ideas-1.4058515 |title=The Museum of Failure showcases — and celebrates — really terrible ideas - Home &amp;#124; As It Happens &amp;#124; CBC Radio |website=Cbc.ca |date=2017-04-06 |accessdate=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.thelocal.se/20170405/sweden-to-open-museum-of-failure-showcasing-flop-products |title=Sweden to open 'Museum of Failure' showcasing flop products | website=Thelocal.se |date=2017-04-05 |accessdate=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the museum was inspired by Samuel West's 2016 visit to [[Museum of Broken Relationships]] in [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.svd.se/flopparna-hedras-i-eget-museum |title=Största flopparna: Segway, cashkort och plastcykel &amp;#124; SvD |website=Svd.se |date= |accessdate=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Museum founder and curator Samuel West reportedly registered a domain name for the museum, and later realized he had misspelled the word "museum".&lt;ref name=WaPo/&gt;

The museum was partially funded by the [[Swedish Innovation Authority]] (Vinnova).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vinnova.se/sv/Resultat/Projekt/Effekta/2013-01243/Museum-of-Failure/ |title=Museum of Failure |website=Vinnova.se |date=2017-02-27 |accessdate=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Red Bull Rampage''' is an invitation-only [[freeride]] [[mountain bike]] competition held near [[Zion National Park]] in [[Virgin, Utah|Virgin]], [[Utah]], [[United States]], just to the north of Gooseberry Mesa. Since 2001 till 2004, it was held off the Kolob Terrace Road, on the western boundary of Zion National Park.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.descent-world.co.uk/DWR_B4_2005/html/news/news2004/RedBullRampage2004.htm|title=Mountains, Mud and Mayhem ar Red Bull Rampage 2004|website=www.descent-world.co.uk|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.redbull.com/us-en/history-of-red-bull-rampage-with-kyle-strait&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The competition was held since 2001 till 2004 and then canceled due to the increasing risk competitors were taking. After a three-year hiatus, Rampage returned in 2008 with a new venue.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.redbull.com/us/en/bike/stories/1331747714648/the-return-of-rampage-2008|title=Rampage Came Back Bigger, Badder in 2008|last=Berard|first=Mike|website=www.redbull.com|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the 2008 event wooden features have been introduced to what has previously been a "natural" only course.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The competition is usually held in October. The event is similar to [[freestyle skiing]] and [[freestyle snowboarding|snowboarding]], where competitors are judged on their choice of lines down the course, their technical ability and the complexity of tricks.

The '''Regulatory Reform (Scotland) Act 2014''' is an [[Act of the Scottish Parliament]], introduced to the legislature in 2013, and became law after receiving [[Royal Assent]] on 19 February 2014. It sought to improve the regulation of businesses requiring certain environmental permits within Scotland whilst strengthening existing protections of the environment.

==History==
[[John Swinney]] MSP introduced the Regulatory Reform (Scotland) Bill to Parliament on 27 March 2013, supported by [[Paul Wheelhouse]] MSP and [[Fergus Ewing]] MSP.&lt;ref name="ParliamentBillOrig" /&gt; It passed through the various stages in Parliament between November 2013 and January 2014 and received Royal Assent on 19 February 2014,&lt;ref name="ParliamentBill" /&gt; with Part 5 of the Act (excluding section 57) coming into force the following day. The legislation allowed for the remainder of the Act to come into force on a future date at the will of the [[Scottish Ministers]].&lt;ref name="LegislationCommencement" /&gt; The Act arose from recommendations made to the Government by the Environmental Crime Task Force.&lt;ref name="GovEnvLegislation"&gt;{{cite web|title=Legislation|url=http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Environment/waste-and-pollution/BER/Legislation|website=gov.scot|publisher=The Scottish Government|accessdate=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulatory changes==
The Act attempts to make it easier for businesses to apply for certain permits and licences in Scotland, while strengthening environmental regulations to protect the country's natural heritage. Businesses will be able to apply for a single permit for a site where several would have been required previously. In addition, it gives courts additional sentencing powers in relation to environmental crime and give the [[Scottish Environment Protection Agency]] more powers to enforce laws. A new criminal offence of causing environmental harm has also been created.&lt;ref name="NetRegs"&gt;{{cite web|title=Regulatory Reform (Scotland) Act 2014|url=http://www.netregs.org.uk/legislation/scotland-environmental-legislation/future-legislation/regulatory-reform-scotland-act-2014/|website=netregs.org.uk|publisher=NetRegs|accessdate=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Government"&gt;{{cite web|title=Regulatory Reform (Scotland) Act|url=http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Business-Industry/support/better-regulation/BetterRegulationBillConsultation|website=gov.scot|publisher=The Scottish Government|accessdate=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] '''Robert Edward Galer''' (24 October 1913 – 27 June 2005) was a [[naval aviator]] in the [[United States Marine Corps]] who received the [[Medal of Honor]] for heroism in aerial combat during the [[Battle of Guadalcanal]] in [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=LAT&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/jul/02/local/me-galer2 |title=Robert Galer, 91; Marine Pilot, Medal of Honor Winner |author=Elaine Woo |date=July 2, 2005 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to command [[Marine Aircraft Group 12]] during the [[Korean War]] and retired a few years after in 1957.

==Early life==
Robert Galer was born in [[Seattle, Washington]], on 24 October 1913. He attended the [[University of Washington]] and was an All-American in basketball.&lt;ref name=LAT/&gt; He graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in commercial engineering in 1935, at which time he received an ROTC commission and began elimination flight training at the Naval Reserve Aviation Base, Seattle.

==Marine Corps career==
In June 1936, he began his Aviation Cadet flight training at the [[Naval Air Station Pensacola]], [[Florida]], and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the [[United States Marine Corps]] on 1 July 1936. Following his designation as a Naval Aviator in April 1937, he was transferred to the 1st Marine [[Brigade]] in [[Quantico, Virginia]], for duty with Aircraft One. In July of the same year, he was assigned to a course of instruction at the [[Basic School]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. Following the completion of his studies in June 1938, he was ordered to the [[New York Navy Yard]], but shortly thereafter was transferred to the [[Virgin Islands]], where he served with Marine Scouting Squadron 3 ([[VMS-3]]) in St. Thomas. He was promoted to first lieutenant in July 1939.

===World War II and after===
[[File:Grumman F3F-2 BuNo 0976 displayed at NMNA, NAS Pensacola.jpg|thumb|Grumman F3F-2, BuNo ''0976'', restored and displayed at the [[National Museum of Naval Aviation]], [[NAS Pensacola]], Florida, after 50 years in the Pacific Ocean off the California coast. It is marked as it was when ditched by 1st Lt. Galer.]]
First Lieutenant Galer returned to the United States in June 1940 and in July reported to the [[2nd Marine Aircraft Wing]] in [[San Diego, California]], and was assigned to Marine Fighting Squadron 2 ([[VMF-2]]). On 29 August 1940, Galer ditched [[Grumman F3F|Grumman F3F-2]], BuNo ''0976'', c/n 374, off the coast of [[San Diego]] while attempting a landing on the {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3}}. (The fighter was rediscovered by a navy submarine in June 1988 and recovered on 5 April 1991. It was restored at the [[San Diego Aerospace Museum]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navalaviationmuseum.org/getdoc/1da8b94f-2f35-4154-8244-c9bec1ba6240/Underwater-Treasures.aspx Underwater Treasures] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621010101/http://navalaviationmuseum.org/getdoc/1da8b94f-2f35-4154-8244-c9bec1ba6240/Underwater-Treasures.aspx |date=2010-06-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1941, he was ordered to [[Hawaii]] and promoted to captain in March 1941. Galer was serving at the [[Marine Corps Air Station Ewa]], [[Oahu]], with Marine Fighting Squadron 211 ([[VMF-211]]) when the Japanese [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked Pearl Harbor]] on 7 December 1941.

In May 1942, Galer assumed command of Marine Fighting Squadron 224 ([[VMF-224]]) and on 30 August 1942 led the squadron to [[Guadalcanal]], where they became part of the [[Cactus Air Force]]. It was while in command of VMF-224 that Galer would be credited with 11 confirmed victories and be awarded the Medal of Honor and a rare British [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] for the same acts of heroism. 

Following the presentation of the Medal of Honor by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] at the [[White House]] on 24 March 1943, Major Galer was ordered to [[Marine Corps Air Station Miramar]], where he served as Assistant Operations Officer. He was grounded because his superiors did not want to risk losing a Medal of Honor recipient; he had been shot down three times during the war (and once more in the Korean War).&lt;ref name=LAT/&gt; Shortly after being promoted to the rank of [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] in November 1943, he was ordered to return to the Hawaiian Islands, where he became Chief of Staff, Marine Air, Hawaiian Area.

In May 1944, Lieutenant Colonel Galer was named as Operations Officer, [[3rd Marine Aircraft Wing]]. He served as an observer during the [[Palau Islands]] and [[Iwo Jima]] campaigns while on temporary duty from the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing. His next assignment found him as Training Officer of Provisional Air Support Command, Fleet Marine Force, Pacific.

He again returned to the United States in June 1945 and reported to the Marine Barracks, Naval Air Training Base, [[Corpus Christi, Texas]], in July as officer in charge of a cadet regiment. He remained in that capacity until August 1947, at which time he was assigned as a student at the [[Armed Forces Staff College]] in [[Norfolk, Virginia]].

In June 1948, he reported to the [[2nd Marine Aircraft Wing]], at the [[Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point]], [[North Carolina]], where he served as Operations and Training Officer. He joined Headquarters Squadron-2 at that station in April 1949 and was transferred on 26 April 1950 to the [[Naval Air Station San Diego]], California. He served there as Marine Planning Officer and, later, as Assistant Chief of Staff for Plans, on the Staff of the Commander, Air Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet. During his assignment, he was promoted to [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] in March 1951.

===Korean War===
Colonel Galer sailed in March 1952 for [[South Korea|Korea]], where he saw duty as Assistant Chief of Staff, G-4 (Supply), of the [[1st Marine Aircraft Wing]] until the following May. He was then named Commanding Officer of [[Marine Aircraft Group 12]] (MAG-12), and, for extraordinary achievement on 11 July 1952, was awarded a Gold Star in lieu of a second [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]].&lt;ref name=LAT/&gt; According to the citation accompanying this medal, he "led a maximum effort strike of Marine attack aircraft against a heavily defended industrial area in the [[North Korea]]n capital city of [[Pyongyang]]."

Colonel Galer was also awarded the [[Legion of Merit]] with Combat "V" for his service in Korea. On 5 August 1952, he was shot down behind enemy lines by anti-aircraft fire while leading a flight of 31 warplanes against targets near the North Korean port city of [[Wonsan]].&lt;ref name=LAT/&gt; He later admitted he "did a dumb thing": After completing the mission, "I went back to take a picture. And this anti-aircraft gun, he nailed me."&lt;ref name=LAT/&gt;  He was later rescued by a [[Sikorsky H-5|HO3S-1]] [[helicopter]] flown by 1st Lieutenant E. J. McCutcheon.&lt;ref name="Dorr"&gt;{{cite book

After a period of hospitalization, he returned to duty at [[Marine Corps Air Station El Toro]], California, in October 1952, as Assistant Chief of Staff, G-1 (Personnel), and later, G-3 (Operations), of Aircraft, Fleet Marine Force, Pacific. He was enrolled as a student in the [[Air University (United States)|Air War College]], [[Maxwell Air Force Base]], [[Montgomery, Alabama]], in July 1953. Upon graduation from the College the following June, he was transferred to Headquarters Marine Corps, [[Washington, D.C.]], where he became Assistant Director, Guided Missiles Division, Bureau of Aeronautics, [[Department of the Navy]]. He served in that capacity until January 1956, when he became Acting Director. The following June he was awarded a [[Master of Engineering Management|Master's degree in Engineering Administration]] from The [[George Washington University]], [[Washington, D.C.]]

For exceptionally meritorious service in combat, he was advanced to [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] upon his retirement on 31 July 1957.

==Civilian life and death==
He worked as vice president of the conglomerate Ling-Temco-Vought and later as an executive with Bright &amp; Co.&lt;ref name=LAT/&gt;

Brigadier General Galer died of a stroke on 27 June 2005 in [[Dallas, Texas]].&lt;ref name=LAT/&gt; He was survived by his second wife, Sharon Alexander Galer, four children and six grandchildren.&lt;ref name=LAT/&gt;

===Medal of Honor citation===
;Citation

:The [[President of the United States]] in the name of the [[United States Congress|Congress]] takes pleasure in presenting the MEDAL OF HONOR to &lt;br/&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''MAJOR ROBERT E. GALER'''&lt;br/&gt;[[USMC|UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS]]&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br/&gt;for service as set forth in the following CITATION:&lt;blockquote&gt;

Citation: For conspicuous heroism and courage above and beyond the call of duty as leader of a marine fighter squadron in aerial combat with enemy Japanese forces in the Solomon Islands area. Leading his squadron repeatedly in daring and aggressive raids against Japanese aerial forces, vastly superior in numbers, Maj. Galer availed himself of every favorable attack opportunity, individually shooting down 11 enemy bomber and fighter aircraft over a period of 29 days. Though suffering the extreme physical strain attendant upon protracted fighter operations at an altitude above 25,000 feet, the squadron under his zealous and inspiring leadership shot down a total of 27 Japanese planes. His superb airmanship, his outstanding skill and personal valor reflect great credit upon Maj. Galer's gallant fighting spirit and upon the U.S. Naval Service.

===University of Washington Medal of Honor Memorial===
At the University of Washington in February 2006, a resolution recommending a memorial be erected to honor [[Fighter pilot|fighter]] [[Flying ace|ace]] and alumnus [[Pappy Boyington]] for his service during [[World War II]] was raised and defeated&lt;ref&gt;[http://senate.asuw.org/legislation/12/R/R-12-18.html "A Resolution to Calling for a Tribute for Col. Gregory 'Pappy' Boyington, USMC", Resolution R-12-18] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107021432/http://senate.asuw.org/legislation/12/R/R-12-18.html |date=2009-01-07 }}, Associated Students of the University of Washington Student Senate, submitted 01/11/2006. (retrieved February 24, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; during a meeting of the student senate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.thedaily.washington.edu/search.lasso?-database=DailyWebSQL&amp;-table=Articles&amp;-response=searchpage.lasso&amp;-keyField=__Record_ID__&amp;-keyValue=15449&amp;-search Boyington memorial&amp;nbsp;— A word from the Senate]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''The Daily'', February 17, 2006. (retrieved February 24, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Some people did not believe the resolution's sponsor had fully addressed the financial and logistical problems of installing a memorial, and some were questioning the widely held assumption that all warriors and acts of war are automatically worthy of memorialization. The story was picked up by some [[blogs]] and conservative news outlets, focusing on two statements made by student senators during the meeting.&lt;ref&gt;Flickinger, Christopher. [http://www.humanevents.com/blog-detail.php?id=12579 "Marines Not Welcome at University of Washington"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217193038/http://www.humanevents.com/blog-detail.php?id=12579 |date=2012-02-17 }}, ''Human Events ", February 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; One student senator, Ashley Miller, said that the UW already had many monuments to "rich, white men" (Boyington claimed partial [[Sioux]] ancestry&lt;ref name=gsnmohrp&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lbst.org/newsite/files/MoHGreatSiouxNation.html |publisher=Lower Brule Sioux Tribe |title=Great Sioux Nation Medal of Honor Recipients |accessdate=October 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was not rich);&lt;ref name=pbisillde&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jL5YAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=DukDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7097%2C386850 |newspaper=Spokesman-Review |location=Spokane, Washington |last=Muir |first=Florabel |agency=''(New York News)'' |title=Pappy Boiyngton is ill, destitute |date=July 16, 1967 |page=12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; another, Jill Edwards, questioned whether the UW should memorialize a person who killed others, summarized in the minutes as saying "she didn't believe a member of the [[Marine Corps]] was an example of the sort of person UW wanted to produce."&lt;ref&gt;[http://senate.asuw.org/secretary/minutes/senate/12/02-07-2006.pdf UW Senate minutes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326044450/http://senate.asuw.org/secretary/minutes/senate/12/02-07-2006.pdf |date=2009-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After its defeat, a new version of the original resolution was submitted that called for a memorial to all eight UW alumni who received the [[Medal of Honor]] after attending the school.&lt;ref name=bmfuwrevs&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/Boyington-memorial-for-UW-revisited-1196521.php |newspaper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |title=Boyington memorial for UW revisited |last=Frey |first=Christine |date=February 21, 2006 |accessdate=October 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://senate.asuw.org/legislation/12/R/R-12-26.html "A Resolution Calling a Memorial for UW Alumni awarded the Medal of Honor"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511145054/http://senate.asuw.org/legislation/12/R/R-12-26.html |date=2008-05-11 }}, Resolution R-12-16, Associated Students of the University of Washington Student Senate, submitted 02/17/2006.&lt;/ref&gt; On April 4, 2006, the resolution passed by a vote of 64 to 14 with several abstentions, on a [[roll call vote]]. The University of Washington Medal of Honor memorial was constructed at the south end of Memorial Way (17th Ave NE), north of [[Red Square (University of Washington)|Red Square]], in the interior of a traffic circle between Parrington and Kane Halls ({{coord|47.6573|-122.3097}}). Privately funded, it was completed in time for a [[Veterans Day (United States)|Veterans Day]] dedication in November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uwnews.org/article.asp?articleID=53378 "Honoring the men behind the Medals of Honor with ceremony, exhibit  "], University of Washington News, 10 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to [[Greg Boyington]], it honors [[Deming Bronson]], [[Bruce Crandall]], Robert&amp;nbsp;Galer, [[John D.

{{Politics of Ancient Rome}}
The '''Roman Republic''' ({{lang-la|Rēs pūblica Rōmāna}}, {{IPA-la|ˈreːs ˈpuːb.lɪ.ka roːˈmaː.na|classical}}; {{lang-it|Repubblica romana}}) was the era of [[ancient Rome|classical Roman civilisation]] beginning with the [[Overthrow of the Roman monarchy|overthrow]] of the [[Roman Kingdom]], traditionally dated to 509 BC, and ending in 27 BC with the establishment of the [[Roman Empire]]. It was during this period that [[Rise of Rome|Rome's control expanded]] from the [[city of Rome|city's]] immediate surroundings to [[hegemony]] over the entire [[Mediterranean|Mediterranean world]].

Roman society under the Republic was a cultural mix of Latin, [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]], and Greek elements, which is especially visible in the [[List of Roman deities|Roman Pantheon]].  Besides, its political organisation was strongly influenced by the [[Polis|Greek city states]] of [[Magna Graecia]], with collective and annual magistracies, overseen by a [[Roman Senate|senate]].  The top magistrates were the two [[Roman consul|consuls]], who had an extensive range of executive, legislative, judicial, military, and religious powers.  Whilst there were elections each year, the Republic was not a [[democracy]], but an [[oligarchy]], as a small number of large families (called ''[[Gens|gentes]]'') monopolised the main magistracies.  Roman institutions underwent considerable changes throughout the Republic to adapt to the difficulties it faced, such as the creation of [[Promagistrate|promagistracies]] to rule its conquered [[Roman province|provinces]], or the composition of the senate.

Unlike the ''[[Pax Romana]]'' of the [[Roman Empire]], the Republic was in a state of quasi-perpetual war throughout its existence.  Its first enemies were its [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latin]] and [[Etruscans|Etruscan]] neighbours as well as the [[Gauls]], who even [[Sack of Rome (387 BC)|sacked the city]] in 387 BC.  The Republic nonetheless demonstrated extreme resilience and always managed to overcome its losses, however catastrophic.  After the Gallic Sack, Rome indeed conquered the whole Italian peninsula in a century, which turned the Republic into a major power in the Mediterranean.  The Republic's greatest enemy was doubtless [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]], against which it waged [[Punic Wars|three wars]].  The [[Punics|Punic]] general [[Hannibal]] famously invaded Italy by [[Hannibal's crossing of the Alps|crossing the Alps]] and inflicted on Rome two devastating defeats at the [[Battle of Lake Trasimene|Lake Trasimene]] and [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]], but the Republic once again recovered and won the war thanks to [[Scipio Africanus]] at the [[Battle of Zama]] in 202 BC.  With Carthage defeated, Rome became the dominant power of the ancient Mediterranean world.  It then embarked in a long series of difficult conquests, after having notably defeated [[Philip V of Macedon|Philip V]] and [[Perseus of Macedon|Perseus]] of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedon]], [[Antiochus III the Great|Antiochus III]] of the [[Seleucid Empire]], the [[Lusitanians|Lusitanian]] [[Viriathus|Viriathis]], the [[Numidia]]n [[Jugurtha]], the great [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontic]] king [[Mithridates VI of Pontus|Mithridates VI]], the [[Gaul]] [[Vercingetorix]], and the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] queen [[Cleopatra]].

At home, the Republic similarly experienced a long streak of social and political crises, which ended in several violent civil wars.  At first, the [[Conflict of the Orders]] opposed the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]], the closed oligarchic elite, to the far more numerous ''plebs'', who finally achieved political equality in several steps during the 4th century BC.  Later, the vast conquests of the Republic disrupted its society, as the immense influx of slaves they brought enriched the aristocracy, but ruined the peasantry and urban workers.  In order to solve this issue, several social reformers, known as the ''[[Populares]]'', tried to pass agrarian laws, but the [[Gracchi|Gracchi brothers]], [[Lucius Appuleius Saturninus|Saturninus]], or [[Clodius Pulcher]], were all murdered by their opponents: the ''[[Optimates]]'', keepers of the traditional aristocratic order.  Mass slavery also caused three [[Servile Wars]]; the last of them was led by [[Spartacus]], a skilful gladiator who ravaged Italy and left Rome powerless until his defeat in 71 BC.  In this context, the last decades of the Republic were marked by the rise of great generals, who exploited their military conquests and the factional situation in Rome to gain control of the political system.  [[Gaius Marius|Marius]] (between 105-86 BC), then [[Sulla]] (between 82-78 BC) dominated in turn the Republic; both used extraordinary powers to purge their opponents.  These multiple tensions lead to a series of [[Roman Republican civil wars|civil wars]]; the first between the two generals [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Pompey]].  Despite his victory and appointment as [[Roman dictator|dictator for life]], Caesar was [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|murdered]] in 44 BC.  Caesar's heir [[Octavian]] and lieutenant [[Mark Antony]] defeated Caesar's assassins [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Brutus]] and [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]] in 42 BC, but then turned against each other.  The final defeat of Mark Antony and his ally [[Reign of Cleopatra|Cleopatra]] at the [[Battle of Actium]] in 31 BC, and the Senate's grant of extraordinary powers to [[Octavian]] as ''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]'' in 27 BC – which effectively made him the first [[Roman emperor]] – thus ended the Republic.

==History==
===Foundation (509 BC)===
{{main|Overthrow of the Roman monarchy}}
Since the [[foundation of Rome]], its rulers had been monarchs, elected for life by the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician noblemen]] who made up the [[Roman senate|Roman Senate]]. The last [[Roman Kingdom|Roman king]] was [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus]] ("Tarquin the Proud"). In the traditional histories, Tarquin was expelled in 509 because his son, [[Sextus Tarquinius]], had raped the noblewoman [[Lucretia]], who afterwards took her own life. Lucretia's father; her husband, [[Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus]]; and Tarquin's own nephew, [[Lucius Junius Brutus]], mustered support from the Senate and army, and forced Tarquin into exile in [[Etruria]].&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, ''The beginnings of Rome'', pp. 215-218: Cornell offers a summary of "Livy's prose narrative" and derived literary works relating to the expulsion of the kings.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus|Dionysius]], iv. 64–85.[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dionysius_of_Halicarnassus/4D*.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Titus Livius|Livy]], i. 57-60&lt;/ref&gt;

The Senate agreed to abolish kingship. Most of the king's former functions were transferred to two consuls, who were elected to office for a term of one year. Each consul had the capacity to act as a check on his [[Collegiality#Collegiality in the Roman Republic|colleague]], if necessary through the same power of ''[[veto]]'' that the kings had held. If a consul abused his powers in office, he could be prosecuted when his term expired. Brutus and Collatinus became Republican Rome's first [[Roman consul|consuls]]. Despite Collatinus' role in the creation of the Republic, he belonged to the same family as the former king, and was forced to abdicate his office and leave Rome. He was replaced as co-consul by [[Publius Valerius Publicola]].&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, ''Beginnings of Rome'', pp. 226 - 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most modern scholarship describes these events as the quasi-mythological detailing of an aristocratic coup within Tarquin's own family, not a popular revolution.  They fit a narrative of a personal vengeance against a tyrant leading to his overthrow, which was common among Greek cities and even theorised by [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Politics'', 5.1311a.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, ''Beginnings of Rome,'' pp. 215-218, 377, 378.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drummond, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', VII, part 2, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rome in Latium (509–387 BC)===
====Early campaigns====
According to Rome's traditional histories, Tarquin made several attempts to retake the throne, including the [[Tarquinian conspiracy]], which involved Brutus' own sons, the [[Roman–Etruscan Wars#War with Veii and Tarquinii, after the overthrow of the monarchy in 509 BC|war with Veii and Tarquinii]] and finally the [[Roman–Etruscan Wars#War with Clusium in 508 BC|war between Rome and Clusium]]; but none succeeded.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, ''Beginnings of Rome,'' pp. 215-217.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Capitoline Brutus Musei Capitolini MC1183.jpg|upright=1.15|thumb|The "[[Capitoline Brutus]]", a [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] possibly depicting [[Lucius Junius Brutus]], who led the revolt against Rome's last king and was a founder of the Republic.|alt=|left]]

The first Roman republican wars were wars of both expansion and defence, aimed at protecting Rome itself from neighbouring cities and nations and establishing its territory in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, Rome's immediate neighbours were either [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latin]] towns and villages, or else tribal [[Sabines]] from the Apennine hills beyond. One by one Rome defeated both the persistent Sabines and the local cities, both those under Etruscan control and those that had cast off their [[Etruria|Etruscan]] rulers. Rome defeated the Latin cities in the [[Battle of Lake Regillus]] in 496, the [[Battle of Mount Algidus]] in 458, the [[Battle of Corbio]] in 446, the Battle of Aricia, and especially the [[Battle of the Cremera]] in 477 wherein it fought against the most important Etruscan city of [[Veii]].&lt;ref name="epitomeB1C12"&gt;Florus, ''Epitome'', i. 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="historyP37"&gt;Grant, ''The History of Rome'', pp. 37-41.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Campaignbox Rome's Early Italian Campaigns}}By the end of this period, Rome had effectively [[Roman conquest of Italy|completed the conquest]] of their immediate Etruscan and Latin neighbours, and also secured their position against the immediate threat posed by the nearby Apennine hill tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Pennell, ''Ancient Rome'', Ch. II&lt;/ref&gt;

====Plebeians and patricians====
{{Main|Conflict of the Orders}}
Beginning with their revolt against Tarquin, and continuing through the early years of the Republic, Rome's patrician aristocrats were the dominant force in politics and society. They initially formed a closed group of about 50 large families, called [[Gens|''gentes'']], who monopolised Rome's magistracies, state priesthoods and senior military posts. The most prominent of these families were the [[Cornelia (gens)|Cornelii]],{{efn-lr|Throughout the Republic, the Cornelii held 75 consulships and 27 consular tribuneships, almost 10% of all the consulships of the period.}} followed by the [[Aemilia (gens)|Aemilii]], [[Claudia (gens)|Claudii]], [[Fabia (gens)|Fabii]], and [[Valeria (gens)|Valerii]]. The power, privilege and influence of leading families derived from their wealth, in particular from their landholdings, their position as [[Patronage in ancient Rome|patrons]], and their numerous clients.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, ''Beginnings of Rome,'' pp. 289-291.&lt;/ref&gt;

The vast majority of Roman citizens were commoners of various social degrees. They formed the backbone of Rome's economy, as smallholding farmers, managers, artisans, traders, and tenants. In times of war, they could be summoned for military service. Most had little direct political influence over the Senate's decisions or the laws it passed, including the abolition of the monarchy and the creation of the consular system. During the early Republic, the ''[[plebs]]'' (or plebeians) emerged as a self-organised, culturally distinct group of commoners, with their own internal hierarchy, laws, customs, and interests.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, ''Beginnings of Rome'', pp. 256-259: ''Plebs'' ("the mass") was originally a disparaging term, but was adopted as a badge of pride by those whom it was meant to insult.  It might not have referred to wealthier commoners.&lt;/ref&gt;

Plebeians had no access to high religious and civil office,{{efn-lr|Several historians, notably [[Tim Cornell]], have challenged this view, saying that in the early Republic the [[Fasti Consulares]] bear names that are distinctively plebeian. Therefore, they claim that the plebeians were only excluded from higher offices by the Decemvirate in 451 BC. More recently, [[Corey Brennan]] has dismissed this theory, arguing that the consular plebeians would not have let the Decemvirs take their power away that easily (cf. ''The Praetorship'', pp. 24, 25). He explains the "plebeian" names in the Fasti by some patrician gentes who later died out, or lost their status. Consequently, this article follows the traditional narrative that the plebeians were excluded from the start.}} and could be punished for offences against laws of which they had no knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Orlin, ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', pp. 59-60.&lt;/ref&gt; For the poorest, one of the few effective political tools was their withdrawal of labour and services, in a "''[[secessio plebis]]''"; they would leave the city en masse, and allow their social superiors to fend for themselves. The [[First secessio plebis|first such secession]] occurred in 494, in protest at the abusive treatment of plebeian debtors by the wealthy during a famine.&lt;ref&gt;The traditional date for the first secession is given by Livy as 494; many other dates have been suggested, and several such events probably took place: see Cornell,  ''Beginnings of Rome'', pp. 215-218, 256-261, 266.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Senate was compelled to give them direct access to the written civil and religious laws, and to the [[Elections in the Roman Republic|electoral]] and political process. To represent their interests, the ''plebs'' elected [[Tribune of the Plebs|tribunes]], who were personally [[Sacrosanctity|sacrosanct]], immune to arbitrary arrest by any magistrate, and had [[veto]] power over the passage of legislation.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of the duties and legal status of plebeian tribunes and aediles, see Andrew Lintott, ''Violence in Republican Rome'', Oxford University Press, 1999, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QIKEpOP4lLIC&amp;lpg=PA145&amp;ots=6D9vv75Yun&amp;dq=servare%20de%20caelo&amp;pg=PA92#v=onepage&amp;q=Ceres&amp;f=false pp. 92–101].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Celtic invasion of Italy (390–387 BC)====
{{Campaignbox Roman-Gallic Wars}}
By 390, several [[Gauls|Gallic tribes]] were invading Italy from the north as their culture expanded throughout Europe. The Romans were alerted to this when a particularly warlike tribe, the [[Senones]],&lt;ref&gt;Florus, ''Epitome'', i. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; invaded two Etruscan towns close to Rome's sphere of influence. These towns, overwhelmed by the enemy's numbers and ferocity, called on Rome for help. The Romans met the Gauls in pitched battle at the [[Battle of the Allia|Battle of Allia River]] around 390–387 BC. The Gauls, led by the chieftain [[Brennus (4th century BC)|Brennus]], defeated the Roman army of approximately 15,000 troops, pursued the fleeing Romans back to Rome, and sacked the city before being either driven off or bought off.

===Roman expansion in Italy (387–272 BC)===

====Wars against Italian neighbours====
[[File:Roman conquest of Italy.PNG|thumb|upright=1.35|left|Map showing Roman expansion in [[Italy]].]]
{{Campaignbox Ancient Unification of Italy}}
{{Campaignbox Samnite Wars}}
From 343 to 341, Rome won [[First Samnite war|two battles]] against their [[Samnites|Samnite]] neighbours, but were unable to consolidate their gains, due to the outbreak of war with former Latin allies.

In the [[Latin War]] (340–338), Rome defeated a coalition of Latins at the battles of [[Battle of Vesuvius|Vesuvius]] and the [[Battle of Trifanum|Trifanum]]. The Latins submitted to Roman rule.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''The History of Rome'', pp. 48-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Second Samnite War]] began in 327.&lt;ref name="historyOfRomeP52"&gt;Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; The fortunes of the two sides fluctuated, but from 314, Rome was dominant, and offered progressively unfavourable terms for peace. The war ended with Samnite defeat at the [[Battle of Bovianum]] (305). By the following year, Rome had annexed most Samnite territory, and began to establish colonies there; but in 298 the Samnites rebelled, and defeated a Roman army, in a [[Third Samnite War]]. Following this success they built a coalition of several previous enemies of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Battle of Populonia]] in 282 Rome finished off the last vestiges of Etruscan power in the region.

====Rise of the plebeian nobility====
In the 4th century, plebeians gradually obtained political equality with patricians. The starting point was in 400, when the first plebeian consular tribunes were elected; likewise, several subsequent consular colleges counted plebeians (in 399, 396, 388, 383, and 379). The reason behind this sudden gain is unknown,&lt;ref&gt;It has nevertheless been speculated that [[Lucius Atilius Luscus]] in 444, and [[Quintus Antonius Meranda]] in 422 were also plebeian. cf. Brennan, ''The Praetorship'', p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;  but it was limited as patrician tribunes retained preeminence over their plebeian colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7-2, p. 338.&lt;/ref&gt; In 385, the former consul and saviour of the besieged Capitol [[Marcus Manlius Capitolinus]] is said to have sided with the plebeians, ruined by the Sack and largely indebted to patricians. The issue of debt relief for the plebs remained indeed pressing throughout the century.  Livy tells that Capitolinus sold his estate to repay the debt of many of them, and even went over to the plebs, the first patrician to do so.  Nevertheless, the growing unrest he had caused led to his trial for seeking kingly power; he was sentenced to death and thrown from the [[Tarpeian Rock]].&lt;ref&gt;Livy, vi. 11, 13-30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7-2, pp. 331, 332.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 376 and 367, the tribunes of the plebs [[Gaius Licinius Stolo]] and [[Lucius Sextius Lateranus]] continued the plebeian agitation and pushed for an ambitious legislation, known as the ''[[Leges Liciniae Sextiae]]''.  Two of their bills attacked patricians' economic supremacy, by creating legal protection against indebtedness and forbidding excessive use of public land, as the ''[[Ager publicus]]'' was monopolised by large landowners.  The most important bill opened the consulship to plebeians.&lt;ref name="Cornell, p. 337."&gt;Cornell, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7-2, p. 337. Cornell explains that Livy confused the contents of the ''Lex Licinia Sextia'' of 366 the ''Lex Genucia'' of 342.&lt;/ref&gt; Other tribunes controlled by the patricians vetoed the bills, but Stolo and Lateranus retaliated by vetoing the elections for five years while being continuously re-elected by the plebs, resulting in a stalemate.&lt;ref&gt;Livy mentions at least two patricians favourable to the tribunes: [[Marcus Fabius Ambustus (consular tribune 381)|Marcus Fabius Ambustus]], Stolo's father-in-law, and the dictator for 368 [[Publius Manlius Capitolinus]], who appointed the first plebeian ''magister equitum'', Gaius Licinius Calvus.&lt;/ref&gt; In 367, they carried a bill creating the ''[[Quindecimviri sacris faciundis|Decemviri sacris faciundis]]'', a college of ten priests, of whom five had to be plebeians, therefore breaking patricians' monopoly on priesthoods. Finally, the resolution of the crisis came from the dictator [[Marcus Furius Camillus|Camillus]], who made a compromise with the tribunes; he agreed to their bills, while they in return consented to the creation of the offices of praetor and curule aediles, both reserved to patricians. Lateranus also became the first plebeian consul in 366; Stolo followed in 361.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, vi. 36-42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Broughton, vol. I, pp. 108-114.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brennan, ''The Praetorship'', pp. 59-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after, plebeians were able to hold both the [[roman dictator|dictatorship]] and the censorship, since former consuls normally filled these senior magistracies.  The four time consul [[Gaius Marcius Rutilus]] became the first plebeian dictator in 356 and censor in 351.  In 342, the tribune of the plebs Lucius Genucius passed his ''[[Leges Genuciae]]'', which abolished interest on loans, in a renewed effort to tackle indebtedness, required the election of at least one plebeian consul each year, and prohibited a magistrate from holding the same magistracy for the next ten years or two magistracies in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0154%3Abook%3D7%3Achapter%3D42 vii. 42].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cornell, p. 337." /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brennan, ''The Praetorship'', pp. 65-67, where he shows that the ten year rule was only temporary at this time.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 339, the plebeian consul and dictator [[Quintus Publilius Philo]] passed three laws extending the powers of the plebeians.  His first law followed the ''Lex Genucia'' by reserving one censorship to plebeians, the second made plebiscites binding on all citizens (including patricians), and the third stated that the Senate had to give its prior approval to plebiscites before becoming binding on all citizens (the ''Lex Valeria-Horatia'' of 449 had placed this approval after the vote).&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7-2, pp. 342, 343.&lt;/ref&gt;  Two years later, Publilius ran for the praetorship, probably in a bid to take the last senior magistracy closed to plebeians, which he won.&lt;ref&gt;Brennan, ''The Praetorship'', pp. 68, 69.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:RomaTempioRotondoForoBoarioJPG.JPG|thumb|The [[Temple of Hercules Victor]], Rome, built in the mid 2nd century BC, most likely by [[Lucius Mummius Achaicus]], who won the [[Achaean War]].|208x208px]]

During the early republic, senators were chosen by the consuls among their supporters.  Shortly before 312, the ''[[Lex Ovinia]]'' transferred this power to the censors, who could only remove senators for misconduct, thus appointing them for life.  This law strongly increased the power of the Senate, which was by now protected from the influence of the consuls and became the central organ of government.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7-2, pp. 393, 394. Cornell gives an earlier date, before 318.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Humm, ''[https://books.openedition.org/efr/1613#bodyftn15 Appius Claudius Caecus]'', pp. 185-226.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 312, following this law, the patrician censor [[Appius Claudius Caecus]] appointed many more senators to fill the new limit of 300, including descendants of freedmen, which was deemed scandalous.  He also incorporated these freedmen in the rural tribes.{{efn-lr|The urban poor were registered in the four urban tribes, whilst the 31 other tribes were composed of landowners, who therefore had the majority in the [[Tribal Assembly]].  Humm thinks that Caecus actually did not appointed "freedmen" in the Senate, but chose new Roman citizens from the recently conquered cities in Italy.}}{{efn-lr|Appius Caecus is a complex character whose reforms are difficult to interpret.  For example, Mommsen considered he was a revolutionary, but was puzzled by his opposition to the ''Lex Ogulnia'', which contradicts his previous "democratic" policies.  Taylor on the contrary thought he defended patricians' interests, as freedmen remained in the clientele of their patrons.  More recently, Humm described his activity as the continuation of the reforms undertaken since Stolo and Lateranus.}}  His tribal reforms were nonetheless cancelled by the next censors, [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Rullianus|Quintus Fabius Maximus]] and [[Publius Decius Mus (consul 312 BC)|Publius Decius Mus]], his political enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, ''Voting Districts'', pp. 132-138.&lt;/ref&gt;  Caecus also launched a vast construction program, building the first aqueduct (''[[Aqua Appia]]''), and the first Roman road (''[[Via Appia]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Bruce MacBain, "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/638505 Appius Claudius Caecus and the Via Appia]", in ''The Classical Quarterly'', New Series, Vol. 30, No. 2 (1980), pp. 356-372.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 300, the two tribunes of the plebs Gnaeus and Quintus Ogulnius passed the ''[[Lex Ogulnia]]'', which created four plebeian pontiffs, therefore equalling the number of patrician pontiffs, and five plebeian augurs, outnumbering the four patricians in the college.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7-2, p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt;  Eventually the Conflict of the Orders ended with the last secession of the plebs in about 287.  The details are not known precisely as Livy's books on the period are lost.  Debt is once again mentioned by ancient authors, but it seems that the plebs revolted over the distribution of the land conquered on the Samnites.&lt;ref&gt;Graham Maddox, "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/41532825 The Economic Causes of the Lex Hortensia]", in ''Latomus'', T. 42, Fasc. 2 (Apr.-Jun. 1983), pp. 277-286.&lt;/ref&gt;  A dictator named [[Quintus Hortensius]] was appointed to negotiate with the plebeians, who had retreated to the [[Janiculum|Janiculum hill]], perhaps to dodge the draft in the war against the [[Lucanians]].  Hortensius passed the ''Lex Hortensia'' which re-enacted the law of 339, making plebiscites binding on all citizens, but also removed the Senate's prior approval to plebiscites.  Popular assemblies were by now sovereign; this put an end to the crisis, and to plebeian agitation for 150 years.&lt;ref&gt;R. Develin, "'[https://www.jstor.org/stable/4430760 Provocatio" and Plebiscites]'. Early Roman Legislation and the Historical Tradition", in ''Mnemosyne'', Fourth Series, Vol. 31, Fasc. 1 (1978), pp. 45-60.&lt;/ref&gt;

These events were a political victory of the wealthy plebeian elite who exploited the economic difficulties of the plebs for their own gain, hence why Stolo, Lateranus, and Genucius bound their bills attacking patricians' political supremacy with debt-relief measures.  They had indeed little in common with the mass of plebeians; Stolo was noteworthy fined for having exceeded the limit on land occupation he had fixed in his own law.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7-2, pp. 340, 341.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of the end of the patrician monopoly on senior magistracies, many small patrician ''gentes'' faded into history during the 4th and 3rd centuries due to the lack of available positions; the [[Verginii]], [[Horatia (gens)|Horatii]], [[Menenia (gens)|Menenii]], [[Cloelii]] all disappear, even the [[Julii]] entered a long eclipse.  They were replaced by plebeian aristocrats, of whom the most emblematic were the [[Caecilia (gens)|Caecilii Metelli]], who received 18 consulships until the end of the Republic; the [[Domitia (gens)|Domitii]], [[Fulvia (gens)|Fulvii]], [[Licinia (gens)|Licinii]], [[Marcia (gens)|Marcii]], or [[Sempronia (gens)|Sempronii]] were as successful.  About a dozen remaining patrician ''gentes'' and twenty plebeian ones thus formed a new elite, called the ''[[nobiles]]'', or ''Nobilitas''.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, ''The Beginnings of Rome'', p. 342&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pyrrhic War (280–275 BC)====
[[File:Pyrrhus_route.jpg|thumb|Route of Pyrrhus in Italy and Sicily.]][[File:Pyrrhus MAN Napoli Inv6150 n03.jpg|thumb|left|Bust of Pyrrhus, found in the [[Villa of the Papyri]] at [[Herculaneum]], now in the [[National Archaeological Museum, Naples|Naples Archaeological Museum]].  Pyrrhus was a brave and chivalrous general who fascinated the Romans, hence his presence in a Roman house.&lt;ref&gt;Franke, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7, part 2, p. 484.&lt;/ref&gt;]]By the beginning of the 3rd century, Rome had established itself as the major power in Italy, but had not yet come into conflict with the dominant military powers of [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]]: [[Carthage]] and the Greek kingdoms.&lt;ref name="historyOrRomeP78"&gt;Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; In 282, several Roman warships entered the harbour of [[Taranto|Tarentum]], thus breaking a treaty between the Republic and the Greek city, which forbade the [[Gulf of Taranto|Gulf]] to Roman navy.  It triggered a violent reaction from the Tarentine democrats, who sank some of the ships; they were in fact worried that Rome could favour the oligarchs in the city, as it had done with the other Greek cities under its control.  The Roman embassy sent to investigate the affair was insulted and war was promptly declared.&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius of Halicarnassus, xix. 5, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  Facing a hopeless situation, the Tarentines (together with the Lucanians and Samnites) appealed for military aid to [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]], the very ambitious king of [[Epirus]].  A cousin of [[Alexander the Great]], he was eager to build an empire for himself in the western Mediterranean, and saw Tarentum's plea as a perfect opportunity towards this goal.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Pyrrhus'', 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Franke, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7, part 2, pp. 456, 457.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Campaignbox Pyrrhic War}}Pyrrhus and his army of 25,500 men (and 20 war elephants) landed in Italy in 280; he was immediately named ''[[Autokrator|Strategos Autokrator]]'' by the Tarentines.  [[Publius Valerius Laevinus]], the consul sent to face him, rejected the king's negotiation offer, as he had more troops and hoped to cut the invasion short.  The Romans were nevertheless defeated at [[Battle of Heraclea|Heraclea]], as their cavalry were afraid of the elephants of Pyrrhus, who lost a large chunk of his army.  Pyrrhus then marched on Rome, but could not take any Roman city on his way; facing the prospect of being flanked by the two consular armies, he moved back to Tarentum.  His adviser, the orator [[Cineas]], made a peace offer before the Roman Senate, asking Rome to return the land it took from the Samnites and Lucanians, and liberate the Greek cities under its control.  The offer was rejected after [[Appius Claudius Caecus|Appius Caecus]] (the old censor of 312) spoke against it in a celebrated speech, which was the earliest recorded by the time of Cicero.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''[[Cato Maior de Senectute]]'', 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Pyrrhus'', 18, 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Franke, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7, part 2, pp. 466-471.&lt;/ref&gt; In 279, Pyrrhus met the consuls [[Publius Decius Mus (consul 279 BC)|Publius Decius Mus]] and Publius Sulpicius Saverrio at the [[Battle of Asculum]], which remained undecided for two days, as the Romans had prepared some special chariots to counter his elephants.  Finally, Pyrrhus personally charged into the melee and won the battle, but at the cost of an important part of his troops; he allegedly said "If we are victorious in one more battle with the Romans, we shall be utterly ruined."&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius of Halicarnassus, xx. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Pyrrhus'', 21 § 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, x. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-lr|There are significant differences between the accounts of Cassius Dio, Dionysius, and Plutarch, but the latter's is traditionally followed in the academic literature.}}  

He escaped the Italian deadlock by answering a call for help from Syracuse, which tyrant Thoenon was desperately fighting an invasion from [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]].  Pyrrhus could not let them take the whole island as it would have compromised his ambitions in the western Mediterranean and so declared war on them.  At first, his Sicilian campaign was an easy triumph; he was welcomed as a liberator in every Greek city on his way, even receiving the title of king (''[[basileus]]'') of Sicily.  The Carthaginians lifted the [[Siege of Syracuse (278 BC)|siege of Syracuse]] before his arrival, but he could not entirely oust them from the island as he failed to take their fortress of [[Marsala|Lilybaeum]].&lt;ref&gt;Franke, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7, part 2, pp. 473-480.&lt;/ref&gt;  His harsh rule, especially the murder of Thoenon, whom he did not trust, soon led to a widespread antipathy among the Sicilians; some cities even defected to Carthage.  In 275, Pyrrhus left the island before he had to face a full-scale rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius of Halicarnassus, xx. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;  He returned to Italy, where his Samnite allies were on the verge of losing the war, despite their earlier victory at the [[Battle of the Cranita hills|Cranita hills]].  Pyrrhus again met the Romans at the [[Battle of Beneventum (275 BC)|Battle of Beneventum]]; this time the consul [[Manius Curius Dentatus|Manius Dentatus]] was victorious, and even captured eight elephants.  Pyrrhus then withdrew from Italy, but left a garrison in Tarentum, and waged a new campaign in Greece against [[Antigonus II Gonatas|Antigonos Gonatas]].  His death in battle at [[Argos]] in 272 forced Tarentum to surrender to Rome.  Since it was the last independent city of Italy, Rome now dominated the entire Italian peninsula, and won an international military reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

===Punic Wars and expansion in the Mediterranean (264–146 BC)===
====First Punic War (264–241 BC)====
{{main|Punic Wars}}
{{Campaignbox First Punic War}}
[[File:Dinastie della grecia occidentale, hieron II, 32 litri di siracusa, 274-216 ac ca.JPG|thumb|Coin of [[Hiero II of Syracuse]]]]

Rome and [[Carthage]] were initially on friendly terms; [[Polybius]] details three treaties between them, the first dating from the first year of the Republic, the second from 348.  The last one was an alliance against Pyrrhus.&lt;ref&gt;Polybius, iii. 22-26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Livy, vii. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scullard, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7, part 2, pp. 517-537.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, tensions rapidly built on after the departure of the Epirote king.  Between 288 and 283, [[Messina|Messena]] in Sicily was taken by the [[Mamertines]], a band of mercenaries formerly employed by [[Agathocles of Syracuse|Agathocles]].  They plundered the surroundings until [[Hiero II of Syracuse|Hiero II]], the new tyrant of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], defeated them (in either 269 or 265).  Carthage could not let him take Messena, as he would have controlled its [[Strait of Messina|Strait]], and garrisoned the city.  In effect under a Carthaginian protectorate, the remaining Mamertines appealed to Rome to regain their independence.  Senators were divided on whether to help them or not, as it would have meant war with Carthage, since Sicily was in its sphere of influence (the treaties furthermore forbade the island to Rome), and also [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]].  A supporter of the war, the consul [[Appius Claudius Caudex]] ([[Appius Claudius Caecus|Caecus]]' brother) turned to the [[Tribal Assembly]] to get a favourable vote, by notably promising booty to voters.&lt;ref&gt;Which assembly was consulted has led to many discussions in the academic literature. Goldsworthy favours the Centuriate Assembly, cf. ''The Punic Wars'', p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;   

Caudex first secured control of the city with ease.  However, Syracuse and Carthage, at war for centuries, made an alliance to counter the invasion and blockaded Messena, but Caudex defeated Hiero and Carthage separately.&lt;ref&gt;Polybius, i. 11, 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Howard Hayes Scullard|H. H. Scullard]] thinks that Caudex was not successful, since he did not receive a triumph and was succeeded in command by Messalla, his political enemy. Cf. ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7, part 2, p. 545.&lt;/ref&gt;  His successor [[Manius Valerius Maximus Corvinus Messalla|Manius Valerius Corvinus Messalla]] landed with a strong 40,000 men army that conquered eastern Sicily, which prompted Hiero to shift his allegiance and forge a long lasting alliance with Rome.  In 262, the Romans moved to the southern coast and besieged [[Agrigento|Akragas]]. In order to raise the siege, Carthage sent reinforcements, including 60 elephants – the first time they used them, but still lost the [[Battle of Agrigentum|battle]].&lt;ref&gt;Scullard, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7, part 2, p. 547.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, as [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]] before, Rome could not take all of Sicily because Carthage's naval superiority prevented them from effectively besieging coastal cities, which could receive supplies from the sea. Using a captured Carthaginian ship as blueprint, Rome therefore launched a massive construction program and built 100 [[Quinquereme|quinqueremes]] in only two months, perhaps through an [[assembly line]] organisation.  They also invented a new device, the ''[[Corvus (boarding device)|corvus]]'', a grappling engine which enabled a crew to board on an enemy ship.&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy, ''The Punic Wars'', p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;  The consul for 260 [[Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Asina|Scipio Asina]] lost the first [[Battle of the Lipari Islands|naval skirmish]] of the war against [[Hannibal Gisco]] at [[Lipari|Lipara]], but his colleague [[Gaius Duilius|Gaius Dullius]] won a [[Battle of Mylae|great victory]] at [[Milazzo|Mylae]].  He destroyed or captured 44 ships, and was the first Roman to receive a naval triumph, which also included captive Carthaginians for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy, ''The Punic Wars'', p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Carthage was victorious on land at [[Battle of Thermae|Thermae]] in Sicily, the ''corvus'' made Rome invincible on the waters.  The consul [[Lucius Cornelius Scipio (consul 259 BC)|Lucius Cornelius Scipio]] (Asina's brother) captured [[Corsica]] in 259; his successors won the naval battles of [[Battle of Sulci|Sulci]] in 258, [[Battle of Tyndaris|Tyndaris]] in 257, and [[Battle of Cape Ecnomus|Cape Ecnomus]] in 256.&lt;ref&gt;Scullard, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7, part 2, pp. 548-554.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Corvus.svg|alt=|left|thumb|Diagram of a ''corvus''.]]In order to haste the end of the war, the consuls for 256 decided to carry the operations to Africa, on Carthage's homeland. The consul [[Marcus Atilius Regulus]] landed on the [[Cap Bon]] peninsula with about 18,000 soldiers.  He captured the city of [[Siege of Aspis|Aspis]], then repulsed Carthage's counter-attack at [[Battle of Adys|Adys]], and took [[Tunis]].  The Carthaginians supposedly sued him for peace, but his conditions were so harsh that they continued the war instead.  They hired Spartan mercenaries, led by [[Xanthippus of Carthage|Xanthippus]], to command their troops.&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy, ''The Punic Wars'', p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 255, the Spartan general marched on Regulus, still encamped at Tunis, who accepted the battle to avoid sharing the glory with his successor.  However, the flat land near Tunis favoured the Punic elephants, [[Battle of the Bagradas River (255 BC)|which crushed the Roman infantry on the Bagradas plain]]; only 2,000 soldiers escaped, and Regulus was captured.  The consuls for 255 nonetheless won a new sounding naval victory at Cape Hermaeum, where they captured 114 warships.  This success was spoilt by a storm that annihilated the victorious navy: 184 ships on 264 sank, 25.000 soldiers and 75.000 rowers drowned.  The ''corvus'' considerably hindered ships' navigation, and made them vulnerable during tempest.  It was abandoned after another similar catastrophe took place in 253 (150 ships sank with their crew).  These disasters prevented any significant campaign between 254 and 252.&lt;ref&gt;Scullard, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7, part 2, pp. 554-557.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:C._Caecilius_Metellus_Caprarius,_denarius,_125_BC,_RRC_269-1.jpg|thumb|Denarius of [[Gaius Caecilius Metellus Caprarius|C. Caecilius Metellus Caprarius]], 125 BC.  The reverse depicts the triumph of his great-grandfather [[Lucius Caecilius Metellus (consul 251 BC)|Lucius]], with the elephants he had captured at [[Battle of Panormus|Panormos]]. The elephant had thence become the emblem of the powerful [[Caecilia (gens)|Caecilii Metelli]].&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, ''Roman Republican Coinage'', pp. 292, 293.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Hostilities in Sicily resumed in 252, with the taking of Thermae by Rome.  Carthage countered the following year, by besieging [[Lucius Caecilius Metellus (consul 251 BC)|Lucius Caecilius Metellus]], who held [[Palermo|Panormos]] (now Palermo).  The consul had dug trenches to counter the elephants, which once hurt by missiles turned back on their own army, resulting in a [[Battle of Panormus|great victory]] for Metellus, who exhibited some captured beasts in the [[Circus Maximus|Circus]].  Rome then besieged the last Carthaginian strongholds in Sicily, [[Marsala|Lilybaeum]] and [[Drepana]], but these cities were impregnable by land.  [[Publius Claudius Pulcher (consul 249 BC)|Publius Claudius Pulcher]], the consul of 249, recklessly tried to take the latter from the sea, but he suffered a terrible [[Battle of Drepana|defeat]]; his colleague [[Lucius Junius Pullus (consul 249 BC)|Lucius Junius Pullus]] likewise lost his fleet off [[Siege of Lilybaeum (250 BC)|Lilybaeum]].  Without ''corvus'', Roman warships had lost their advantage.  By now, both sides were drained and could not undertake large scale operations; Roman citizenry had indeed been reduced by 17% in 20 years.  The only military activity during this period was the landing in Sicily of [[Hamilcar Barca]] in 247, who harassed the Romans with a mercenary army from a citadel he built on [[Monte Erice|Mt. Eryx]].&lt;ref&gt;Scullard, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7, part 2, pp. 559-564.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, unable to take the Punic fortresses in Sicily, Rome tried to win the decision at sea and built a new navy, thanks to a forced borrowing on the rich.  In 242, the 200 quinqueremes of the consul [[Gaius Lutatius Catulus]] blockaded Drepana.  The rescue fleet from Carthage arrived the next year, but was largely undermanned and [[Battle of the Aegates|soundly defeated]] by Catulus.  Exhausted and unable to bring supplies to Sicily, Carthage sued for peace.  Catulus and Hamilcar negotiated a treaty, which was somewhat lenient to Carthage, but the Roman people rejected it and imposed harsher terms: Carthage had to pay 1000 [[Talents of silver|talents]] immediately and 2200 over ten years, and evacuate Sicily.  The fine was so high that Carthage could not pay Hamilcar's mercenaries, who had been shipped back to Africa.  They revolted during the [[Mercenary War]], which Carthage had enormous difficulties to suppress.  Meanwhile, Rome took advantage of a similar revolt in [[Sardinia]] to seize the island from Carthage, in violation of the peace treaty.  This stab-in-the-back led to permanent bitterness in Carthage, and [[revanchism]].&lt;ref&gt;Scullard, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7, part 2, pp. 565-569.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Second Punic War (218–201 BC)====
{{Campaignbox Second Punic War}}
After its victory, the Republic shifted its attention to its northern border as the [[Insubres]] and [[Boii]] were threatening Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyos, ''Companion to the Punic Wars'', p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, Carthage compensated the loss of Sicily and Sardinia with the [[Barcid conquest of Hispania|conquest]] of Southern [[Hispania]] (up to [[Salamanca]]), and its rich silver mines.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyos, ''Companion to the Punic Wars'', p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;  This enterprise was the work of the [[Barcid family]], headed by [[Hamilcar Barca|Hamilcar]], the former commander in Sicily.  Hamilcar nonetheless died against the [[Oretani]] in 228; his son-in-law [[Hasdrubal the Fair]] – the founder of [[Carthago Nova]] – and his three sons [[Hannibal Barca|Hannibal]], [[Hasdrubal Barca|Hasdrubal]], and [[Mago Barca|Mago]], succeeded him.&lt;ref&gt;Carthage was an oligarchy at the time, dominated by the Barcids.  The Roman historian [[Fabius Pictor]] thought that the Barcids conquered Spain without approval from the Carthaginian government; a view rejected by Polybius. cf. Hoyos, ''Companion to the Punic Wars'', pp. 212-213.&lt;/ref&gt;  This rapid expansion worried Rome, which concluded a treaty with Hasdrubal in 226, stating that Carthage could not cross the [[Ebro river]].&lt;ref&gt;Scullard, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', pp. 28-31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoyos, ''Companion to the Punic Wars'', pp. 216-219.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the city of [[Saguntum]], located in the south of the Ebro, appealed to Rome in 220 to act as arbitrator during a ''[[Stasis (political history)|stasis]]''.  Hannibal dismissed Roman rights on the city, and took it in 219.&lt;ref&gt;Scullard, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', pp. 33-36.&lt;/ref&gt;  At Rome, the [[Cornelii]] and the [[Aemilii]] considered the capture of Saguntum a ''casus belli'',&lt;ref&gt;Scullard, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', p. 37.  These ''gentes'' had interests in [[Marseille|Massalia]] and other Greek cities of the western Mediterranean.  Massalia was concerned by the Carthaginian growing influence in Spain.&lt;/ref&gt; and won the debate against [[Fabius Maximus Verrucosus]], who wanted to negotiate.  An embassy carrying an ultimatum was sent to Carthage, asking its senate to condemn Hannibal's deeds.  The Carthaginian refusal started the Second Punic War.&lt;ref&gt;Scullard, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Second Punic War full-en.svg|alt=|left|thumb|422x422px|Principal offensives of the war: Rome (red), Hannibal (green), Hasdrubal (purple).]]

Initially, the plan of the Republic was to carry war outside Italy, by sending the consuls [[Publius Cornelius Scipio]] to Hispania, and [[Tiberius Sempronius Longus (consul 218 BCE)|Sempronius Longus]] to Africa, while their naval superiority prevented Carthage from attacking from the sea.&lt;ref&gt;Briscoe, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;  This plan was thwarted by Hannibal's bold move to Italy.  In May 218, he indeed crossed the Ebro with a large army of about 100,000 soldiers and 37 elephants.&lt;ref&gt;Fronda, ''Companion to the Punic Wars'', pp. 251, 252.&lt;/ref&gt;  He passed in [[Gaul]], [[Battle of Rhone Crossing|crossed the Rhone]], then the [[Hannibal's crossing of the Alps|Alps]], possibly through the [[Col de Clapier]] (2,491 meters high).&lt;ref&gt;Briscoe, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;  This famous exploit cost him half of his troops,&lt;ref&gt;Livy, xxi. 38, quoting [[Lucius Cincius Alimentus|Cincius Alimentus]] who reported a personal discussion with Hannibal, in which he said he lost 38,000 men by crossing the Alps.&lt;/ref&gt; but he could now rely on the Boii and Insubres, still at war with Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Briscoe, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;  Publius Scipio, who had failed to block Hannibal on the Rhone, sent his elder brother [[Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus|Gnaeus]] with the main part of his army in Hispania according to the initial plan, and went back to Italy with the rest to resist Hannibal in Italy, but he was defeated and wounded near [[Battle of Ticinus|Pavia]].

Hannibal then marched south and won three outstanding victories. The first one was on the banks of the [[Battle of the Trebia|Trebia]] in December 218, where he defeated the other consul Sempronius Longus thanks to his brother Mago, who had concealed some elite troops behind the legions and attacked them from the rear once fighting Hannibal.  More than half of the Roman army was lost.  Hannibal then ravaged the country around [[Arezzo|Arretium]] to lure the new consul [[Gaius Flaminius]] into a trap, at the [[Lake Trasimeno|Lake Trasimene]].  He had hidden his troops in the hills surrounding the lake and attacked Flaminius when he was cornered on the shore.  This [[Battle of Lake Trasimene|clever ambush]] resulted in the death of the consul and the complete destruction his army of 30,000 men.  In 216, the new consuls [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus (consul 219 BC)|Aemilius Paullus]] and [[Gaius Terentius Varro|Terentius Varro]] mustered the biggest army possible, with eight legions (more than 80,000 soldiers) – twice as many as the Punic army – and confronted Hannibal, who was encamped at [[Cannae]], in [[Apulia]].  Despite his numerical disadvantage, Hannibal used his heavier cavalry to rout the Roman wings and envelope their infantry, whom he annihilated.  In terms of casualties, the [[Battle of Cannae]] was the worst defeat in the history of Rome: only 14,500 soldiers escaped; Paullus was killed as well as well as 80 senators.&lt;ref&gt;Polybius (iii. 117) gives 70,000 dead. Livy (xxii. 49) gives 47,700 dead and 19,300 prisoners.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, the Boii ambushed the army of the consul-elect for 215, [[Lucius Postumius Albinus (consul 234 BC)|Postumius Albinus]], who died with all his army of 25,000 men in the [[Battle of Silva Litana|Forest of Litana]]. 

[[File:Carthage, quarter shekel, 237-209 BC, SNG BM Spain 102.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|A [[Carthaginian currency|quarter shekel]] of Carthage, perhaps minted in Spain.  The obverse may depicts [[Hannibal]] under the traits of young [[Melqart]].  The reverse features one of his famous war elephants.&lt;ref&gt;''Sylloge Nummorum Graecorum, Great Britain, Volume IX, British Museum, Part 2: Spain'', London, 2002, n° 102.&lt;/ref&gt;|221x221px]]These disasters triggered a wave of defection among Roman allies, with the rebellions of the Samnites, Oscans, Lucanians, and Greek cities of Southern Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Briscoe, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', pp. 52, 53.&lt;/ref&gt;   In Macedonia, [[Philip V of Macedon|Philip V]] also made an [[Macedonian–Carthaginian Treaty|alliance]] with Hannibal in order to take [[Illyria]] and the area around [[Epidamnos|Epidamnus]], occupied by Rome.  His attack on [[Apollonia (Illyria)|Apollonia]] started the [[First Macedonian War]].  In 215, [[Hiero II of Syracuse]] died of old age, and his young grandson [[Hieronymus of Syracuse|Hieronymus]] broke the long alliance with Rome to side with Carthage.  At this desperate point, the aggressive strategy against Hannibal advocated by the Scipii was abandoned in favour of delaying tactics that avoided direct confrontation with him.  Its main proponents were the consuls Fabius Maximus Verrucosus, nicknamed ''Cunctator'' ("the delayer"), [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus|Claudius Marcellus]], and [[Quintus Fulvius Flaccus (consul 237 BC)|Fulvius Flaccus]].  The "[[Fabian strategy|Fabian Strategy]]" favoured a slow reconquest of the lost territories, since Hannibal could not be everywhere to defend them.&lt;ref&gt;Briscoe, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', pp. 49, 50.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although he remained invincible on the battlefield, defeating all the Roman armies on his way, he could not prevent Claudius Marcellus from taking Syracuse in 212 after a [[Siege of Syracuse (213–212 BC)|long siege]], nor the fall of his bases of Capua and Tarentum in [[Siege of Capua (211 BC)|211]] and [[Battle of Tarentum (209 BC)|209]]. However, in 208 the consuls Claudius Marcellus and Quinctius Crispinus were ambushed and killed near [[Venusia]].      

In Hispania, the situation was overall much better for Rome.  This theatre was mostly commanded by the brothers Publius and Gnaeus Scipio, who won the battles of [[Battle of Cissa|Cissa]] in 218, soon after Hannibal's departure, and [[Battle of Dertosa|Dertosa]] against his brother Hasdrubal in 215, which enabled them to conquer the eastern coast of Hispania.  In 211 however, Hasdrubal and Mago Barca successfully returned the [[Celtiberians|Celtiberian tribes]] that supported the Scipii, and attacked them simultaneously at the [[Battle of the Upper Baetis]], in which the Scipii brothers died.&lt;ref&gt;Briscoe, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;  Publius' son, the future [[Scipio Africanus]], was then elected with a special proconsulship to lead the Hispanic campaign.  He soon showed outstanding skills as commander, by winning a series of battles with ingenious tactics.  In 209, he took [[Battle of Cartagena (209 BC)|Carthago Nova]], the main Punic base in Hispania, then defeated Hasdrubal at the [[Battle of Baecula]] (208).&lt;ref&gt;Briscoe, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;  After his defeat, Hasdrubal was ordered by Carthage to move to Italy. Since he could not use ships, he followed the same route as his brother through the Alps, but this time the surprise effect was gone. The consuls [[Marcus Livius Salinator|Livius Salinator]] and [[Gaius Claudius Nero|Claudius Nero]] were awaiting him and won the [[Battle of the Metaurus]], where Hasdrubal died.&lt;ref&gt;Briscoe, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was the turning point of the war.  The attrition campaign had indeed worked well: Hannibal's troops were now depleted; he only had one elephant left ([[Surus]]) and retreated to [[Calabria|Bruttium]], on the defensive.  In Greece, Rome contained Philip V without devoting too much forces, by setting an alliance with the [[Aetolian League]], [[Sparta]], and [[Pergamon]], which also prevented Philip from aiding Hannibal.  The war resulted in a stalemate, with the [[Treaty of Phoenice]] signed in 205.
{{Campaignbox First Macedonian War}}

In Hispania, Scipio continued his triumphal campaign at the battles of [[Battle of Carmona|Carmona]] in 207, and [[Battle of Ilipa|Ilipa]] (now [[Seville]]) in 206, which ended the Punic threat on the peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Briscoe, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;  Elected consul in 205, he convinced the senate to cancel the Fabian Strategy, and instead to invade Africa by using the support of the Numidian king [[Masinissa|Massinissa]], who had defected to Rome.  Scipio landed in Africa in 204. He took [[Battle of Utica (203 BC)|Utica]], then won the [[Battle of the Great Plains]], which prompted Carthage to recall Hannibal from Italy and open peace negotiations with Rome.  The talks nevertheless failed because Scipio wanted to impose harsher terms on Carthage, in order to avoid it from rising again as a threat to Rome.  Hannibal was therefore sent to face Scipio at [[Battle of Zama|Zama]].  Scipio could now use the heavy Numidian cavalry of Massinissa – which had hitherto been so successful against Rome – to rout the Punic wings, then flank the infantry, as Hannibal had done at Cannae. Defeated for the first time, Hannibal convinced the Carthaginian senate to pay the war indemnity, which was even harsher than that of 241: 10,000 talents in 50 instalments. Carthage furthermore had to give up all its elephants, all its fleet but ten [[Trireme|triremes]], all its possessions outside its core territory in Africa (what is now [[Tunisia]]), and could not declare war without the authorisation of Rome.  In effect, Carthage was condemned to be a minor power, while Rome recovered from a desperate situation to dominate the Western Mediterranean.

{{further|Rise of Rome}}

Rome's preoccupation with its war with Carthage provided an opportunity for [[Philip V of Macedon|Philip V]] of the kingdom of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]], located in the north of the [[Greek peninsula]], to attempt to extend his power westward. Philip sent ambassadors to Hannibal's camp in Italy, to negotiate an alliance as common enemies of Rome.&lt;ref name="enemiesP47"&gt;Matyszak, ''The Enemies of Rome'', p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="historyP115"&gt;Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; However, Rome discovered the agreement when Philip's emissaries were captured by a Roman fleet.&lt;ref name="enemiesP47"/&gt; The [[First Macedonian War]] saw the Romans involved directly in only limited land operations, but they ultimately achieved their objective of pre-occupying Philip and preventing him from aiding Hannibal.

The past century had seen the Greek world dominated by the three primary successor kingdoms of [[Alexander the Great]]'s empire: [[Ptolemaic Egypt]], [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]] and the [[Seleucid Empire]]. In 202, internal problems led to a weakening of Egypt's position, thereby disrupting the power balance among the successor states. Macedonia and the Seleucid Empire agreed to an alliance to conquer and divide Egypt.&lt;ref name="Eckstein, Arthur p42"&gt;Eckstein, ''Rome Enters the Greek East'', p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Fearing this increasingly unstable situation, several small Greek kingdoms sent delegations to Rome to seek an alliance.&lt;ref&gt;Eckstein, Arthur. "Rome Enters the Greek East". p43&lt;/ref&gt; The delegation succeeded, even though prior Greek attempts to involve Rome in Greek affairs had been met with Roman apathy. Our primary source about these events, the surviving works of Polybius, do not state Rome's reason for getting involved. Rome gave Philip an ultimatum to cease his campaigns against Rome's new Greek allies. Doubting Rome's strength (a reasonable doubt, given Rome's performance in the [[First Macedonian War]]) Philip ignored the request, and Rome sent an army of Romans and Greek allies, beginning the [[Second Macedonian War]].&lt;ref name="enemiesP49"&gt;Matyszak, ''The Enemies of Rome'', p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his recent successes against the Greeks and earlier successes against Rome, Philip's army buckled under the pressure from the Roman-Greek army. In 197, the Romans decisively defeated Philip at the [[Battle of Cynoscephalae]], and Philip was forced to give up his recent Greek conquests.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans declared the "Peace of the Greeks", believing that Philip's defeat now meant that Greece would be stable. They pulled out of Greece entirely, maintaining minimal contacts with their Greek allies.&lt;ref&gt;Eckstein, Arthur. "Rome Enters the Greek East". p48&lt;/ref&gt;

With Egypt and Macedonia weakened, the [[Seleucid Empire]] made increasingly aggressive and successful attempts to conquer the entire Greek world.&lt;ref&gt;Eckstein, Arthur. "Rome Enters the Greek East". p51&lt;/ref&gt; Now not only Rome's allies against Philip, but even Philip himself, sought a Roman alliance against the Seleucids.&lt;ref name="historyP119"&gt;Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; The situation was made worse by the fact that [[Hannibal]] was now a chief military advisor to the Seleucid emperor, and the two were believed to be planning an outright conquest not just of Greece, but of Rome itself.&lt;ref name="Eckstein, Arthur p52"&gt;Eckstein, Arthur. "Rome Enters the Greek East". p52&lt;/ref&gt; The Seleucids were much stronger than the Macedonians had ever been, because they controlled much of the former Persian Empire, and by now had almost entirely reassembled Alexander the Great's former empire.&lt;ref name="Eckstein, Arthur p52"/&gt;

[[File:Escipión africano.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Roman portraiture|Roman bronze bust]] of [[Scipio Africanus]], dated mid 1st century BC, and found in the [[Villa of the Papyri]] at [[Herculaneum]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Naples National Archaeological Museum]] (Inv. No. 5634).&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Fearing the worst, the Romans began a major mobilization, all but pulling out of recently pacified Spain and Gaul.&lt;ref name="Eckstein, Arthur p52"/&gt; They even established a major garrison in [[Sicily]] in case the Seleucids ever got to [[Italy]].&lt;ref name="Eckstein, Arthur p52"/&gt; This fear was shared by Rome's Greek allies, who had largely ignored Rome in the years after the Second Macedonian War, but now followed Rome again for the first time since that war.&lt;ref name="Eckstein, Arthur p52"/&gt; A major Roman-Greek force was mobilized under the command of the great hero of the Second Punic War, [[Scipio Africanus]], and set out for Greece, beginning the [[Roman-Syrian War]]. After initial fighting that revealed serious Seleucid weaknesses, the Seleucids tried to turn the Roman strength against them at the [[Battle of Thermopylae (191 BC)|Battle of Thermopylae]] (as they believed the [[300 Spartans]] had done centuries earlier).&lt;ref name="historyP119"/&gt; Like the Spartans, the Seleucids lost the battle, and were forced to evacuate Greece.&lt;ref name="historyP119"/&gt; The Romans pursued the Seleucids by crossing the [[Hellespont]], which marked the first time a Roman army had ever entered [[Asia]].&lt;ref name="historyP119"/&gt; The decisive engagement was fought at the [[Battle of Magnesia]], resulting in a complete Roman victory.&lt;ref name="historyP119"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lane Fox, ''The Classical World'', p. 326&lt;/ref&gt; The Seleucids sued for peace, and Rome forced them to give up their recent Greek conquests. Although they still controlled a great deal of territory, this defeat marked the decline of their empire, as they were to begin facing increasingly aggressive subjects in the east (the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]]) and the west (the Greeks). Their empire disintegrated into a rump over the course of the next century, when it was eclipsed by [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]]. Following Magnesia, Rome again withdrew from Greece, assuming (or hoping) that the lack of a major Greek power would ensure a stable peace. In fact, it did the opposite.&lt;ref&gt;Eckstein, Arthur. "Rome Enters the Greek East". p55&lt;/ref&gt;

====Conquest of Greece (172–146 BC)====
In 179 Philip died.&lt;ref name="historyP120"&gt;Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; His talented and ambitious son, Perseus, took the throne and showed a renewed interest in conquering Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy, ''In the Name of Rome'', p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; With her Greek allies facing a major new threat, Rome declared war on Macedonia again, starting the [[Third Macedonian War]]. Perseus initially had some success against the Romans. However, Rome responded by sending a stronger army. This second consular army decisively defeated the Macedonians at the [[Battle of Pydna]] in 168&lt;ref name="historyP120"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy, ''In the Name of Rome'', p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; and the Macedonians duly capitulated, ending the war.&lt;ref&gt;Matyszak, ''The Enemies of Rome'', p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Convinced now that the Greeks (and therefore the rest of the region) would not have peace if left alone, Rome decided to establish its first permanent foothold in the Greek world, and divided the Kingdom of Macedonia into four client republics. Yet, Macedonian agitation continued. The [[Fourth Macedonian War]], 150 to 148 BC, was fought against a Macedonian pretender to the throne who was again destabilizing Greece by trying to re-establish the old kingdom. The Romans swiftly defeated the Macedonians at the [[Battle of Pydna (148 BC)|Second battle of Pydna]].

The [[Achaean League]] chose this moment to fight Rome but was swiftly defeated. In 146 (the same year as the destruction of [[Carthage]]), [[Roman Corinth|Corinth]] was besieged and destroyed, which led to the league's surrender.&lt;ref&gt;History of Rome – The republic, Isaac Asimov.&lt;/ref&gt; After nearly a century of constant crisis management in Greece, which always led back to internal instability and war when she withdrew, Rome decided to divide Macedonia into two new Roman provinces, [[Achaea (Roman province)|Achaea]] and [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]].

====Third Punic War (149–146 BC)====
{{Campaignbox Third Punic War}}
Carthage never recovered militarily after the Second Punic War,&lt;ref&gt;Pennell, ''Ancient Rome'', Ch. XV, para. 24&lt;/ref&gt; but quickly did so economically and the [[Third Punic War]] that followed was in reality a simple punitive mission after the neighbouring Numidians allied to Rome robbed/attacked Carthaginian merchants. Treaties had forbidden any war with Roman allies, and defence against robbing/pirates was considered as "war action": Rome decided to annihilate the city of Carthage.&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy, ''The Punic Wars'', p. 338&lt;/ref&gt; Carthage was almost defenceless, and submitted when besieged.&lt;ref name="punicP339"&gt;Goldsworthy, ''The Punic Wars'', p. 339&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Romans demanded complete surrender and removal of the city into the (desert) inland far off any coastal or harbour region, and the Carthaginians refused. The city was [[Battle of Carthage (c. 149 BC)|besieged, stormed, and completely destroyed]].

Ultimately, all of Carthage's North African and Iberian territories were acquired by Rome. Note that "Carthage" was not an 'empire', but a league of Punic colonies (port cities in the western Mediterranean) like the 1st and 2nd Athenian ("Attic") leagues, under leadership of Carthage. Punic Carthage was gone, but the other Punic cities in the western Mediterranean flourished under Roman rule.

===Social troubles and first civil war (146–60 BC)===
[[Rise of Rome|Rome's rapid expansion]] destabilised its social organisation and triggered unrest in its core territory, which ultimately led to several revolts and a civil war. The period is marked by the rise of strong men (Marius, then Sulla, Pompey, and to a lesser extent Crassus), who exploited their military successes to control the political system.

====The Gracchi (133–121 BC)====
{{Campaignbox Servile Wars}}
{{Main|Gracchi}}

In 135, the first slave uprising, known as the [[First Servile War]], broke out in Sicily. After initial successes, the slaves led by [[Eunus]] and [[Cleon (Roman rebel)|Cleon]] were annihilated by the consul [[Publius Rupilius]] in 132.

In this context, [[Tiberius Gracchus]] was elected tribune in 133. He attempted to enact a law which would have limited the amount of land that any individual could own. The aristocrats, who stood to lose an enormous amount of money, were bitterly opposed to this proposal. Tiberius submitted this law to the Plebeian Council, but the law was vetoed by a tribune named [[Marcus Octavius]]. Tiberius then used the Plebeian Council to [[impeach]] Octavius. The theory, that a representative of the people ceases to be one when he acts against the wishes of the people, was counter to Roman constitutional theory. If carried to its logical end, this theory would remove all constitutional restraints on the popular will, and put the state under the absolute control of a temporary popular majority.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 96"&gt;Abbott, 96&lt;/ref&gt; His law was enacted, but Tiberius was murdered with 300 of his associates&lt;ref name="Hillsborough"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bishop|first=Paul|title=Rome: Transition from Republic to Empire|url=http://www.hccfl.edu/media/160883/ee1rome.pdf|publisher=Hillsborough Community College|accessdate=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he stood for reelection to the tribunate.

Tiberius' brother Gaius was elected tribune in 123. [[Gaius Gracchus]]' ultimate goal was to weaken the senate and to strengthen the democratic forces.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 97"&gt;Abbott, 97&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, for example, the senate would eliminate political rivals either by establishing special judicial commissions or by passing a
''[[senatus consultum ultimum]]'' ("ultimate decree of the senate"). Both devices would allow the Senate to bypass the ordinary due process rights that all citizens had. Gaius outlawed the judicial commissions, and declared the ''senatus consultum ultimum'' to be unconstitutional. Gaius then proposed a law which would grant citizenship rights to Rome's Italian allies. This last proposal was not popular with the plebeians and he lost much of his support.&lt;ref&gt;Stobart, J.C. (1978). "III". In Maguinness, W.S; Scullard, H.H. The Grandeur That was Rome (4th ed.). Book Club Associates. pp. 75–82.&lt;/ref&gt; He stood for election to a third term in 121, but was defeated and then murdered by representatives of the senate with 3,000 of his supporters on Capitoline Hill in Rome.&lt;ref name="Hillsborough" /&gt;

In 121, the province of Gallia Narbonensis was established after the victory of [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Allobrogicus|Quintus Fabius Maximus]] over a coalition of Arverni and Allobroges in southern Gaul in 123. The city of Narbo was founded there in 118 by [[Lucius Licinius Crassus]].

====Rise of Marius====
{{Campaignbox Jugurthine War}}
[[File:Marius Glyptothek Munich 319.jpg|thumb|upright|Bust of [[Gaius Marius]], instigator of the [[Marian reforms]].]]
{{further|Rise of Rome}}

The [[Jugurthine War]] of 111–104 was fought between Rome and [[Jugurtha]] of the North African kingdom of [[Numidia]]. It constituted the final Roman pacification of Northern Africa,&lt;ref name="stormingP29"&gt;Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; after which Rome largely ceased expansion on the continent after reaching natural barriers of desert and mountain. Following Jugurtha's usurpation of the throne of Numidia,&lt;ref&gt;Sallust, ''The Jugurthine War'', XII&lt;/ref&gt; a loyal ally of Rome since the Punic Wars,&lt;ref&gt;Matyszak, ''The Enemies of Rome'', p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; Rome felt compelled to intervene. Jugurtha impudently bribed the Romans into accepting his usurpation. Jugurtha was finally captured not in battle but by treachery.

[[Jugurtha]] is shown captive on the right.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, ''Roman Republican Coinage'', pp. 449-451.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In 118, King [[Micipsa]] of [[Numidia]] (current-day Algeria and Tunisia) died. He was succeeded by two legitimate sons, [[Adherbal (king of Numidia)|Adherbal]] and [[Hiempsal I|Hiempsal]], and an illegitimate son, [[Jugurtha]]. Micipsa divided his kingdom between these three sons. Jugurtha, however, turned on his brothers, killing Hiempsal and driving Adherbal out of Numidia. Adherbal fled to Rome for assistance, and initially Rome mediated a division of the country between the two brothers. Eventually, Jugurtha renewed his offensive, leading to a long and inconclusive war with Rome. He also bribed several Roman commanders, and at least two tribunes, before and during the war. His nemesis, [[Gaius Marius]], a legate from a virtually unknown provincial family, returned from the war in Numidia and was elected consul in 107 over the objections of the aristocratic senators. Marius invaded Numidia and brought the war to a quick end, capturing Jugurtha in the process. The apparent incompetence of the Senate, and the brilliance of Marius, had been put on full display.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 100"&gt;Abbott, 100&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[populares]]'' party took full advantage of this opportunity by allying itself with Marius.

{{Campaignbox Cimbrian War}}
The [[Cimbrian War]] (113–101) was a far more serious affair than the earlier clashes of 121. The [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes of the ''[[Cimbri]]'' and the ''[[Teutons]]''&lt;ref name="appianS6"&gt;Appian, ''History of Rome'', §6&lt;/ref&gt; migrated from northern Europe into Rome's northern territories,&lt;ref name="enemiesP75"&gt;Matyszak, ''The Enemies of Rome'', p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; and clashed with Rome and her allies.&lt;ref name="stormingP6"&gt;Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Battle of Aquae Sextiae]] and the [[Battle of Vercellae]] both tribes were virtually annihilated, which ended the threat.

====Sulla's Civil Wars====
{{Campaignbox Ancient Unification of Italy}}
{{Campaignbox First Mithridatic War}}
{{Campaignbox Sulla's Second Civil War}}
In 91 the [[Social War (91–88 BC)|Social War]] broke out between Rome and its former allies in Italy when the allies complained that they shared the risk of Rome's military campaigns, but not its rewards. Although they lost militarily, the allies achieved their objectives with legal proclamations which granted citizenship to more than 500,000 Italians.

The internal unrest reached its most serious state, however, in the [[Sulla's civil wars|two civil wars]] that were caused by the clash between generals [[Gaius Marius]] and [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] starting from 88. In the [[Battle of the Colline Gate (82 BC)|Battle of the Colline Gate]]&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; at the very door of the city of Rome, a Roman army under Sulla bested an army of the Marius supporters and entered the city. Sulla's actions marked a watershed in the willingness of Roman troops to wage war against one another that was to pave the way for the wars which ultimately overthrew the Republic, and caused the founding of the [[Roman Empire]].

Several years later, in 88, a Roman army was sent to put down an emerging Asian power, king [[Mithridates VI of Pontus|Mithridates]] of [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]]. The army, however, was not defeated and won. One of Marius' old quaestors, [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]], had been elected consul for the year, and was ordered by the senate to assume command of the war against Mithridates. Marius, a member of the "''[[populares]]''" party, had a tribune revoke Sulla's command of the war against Mithridates. Sulla, a member of the aristocratic ("''[[optimates]]''") party, brought his army back to Italy and [[Sulla's civil wars|marched on Rome]]. Sulla was so angry at Marius' tribune that he passed a law intended to permanently weaken the tribunate.&lt;ref name = "Abbott, 103"&gt;Abbott, 103&lt;/ref&gt; He then returned to his war against Mithridates. With Sulla gone, the ''populares'' under Marius and [[Lucius Cornelius Cinna]] soon took control of the city.

During the period in which the ''populares'' party controlled the city, they flouted convention by re-electing Marius consul several times without observing the customary ten-year interval between offices.&lt;ref name = "Abbott, 106"&gt;Abbott, 106&lt;/ref&gt; They also transgressed the established oligarchy by advancing unelected individuals to magisterial office, and by substituting magisterial edicts for popular legislation. Sulla soon made peace with Mithridates. In 83, he returned to Rome, overcame all resistance, and recaptured the city. Sulla and his supporters then slaughtered most of Marius' supporters. Sulla, having observed the violent results of radical ''popular'' reforms, was naturally conservative. As such, he sought to strengthen the aristocracy, and by extension the senate.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 104"&gt;Abbott, 104&lt;/ref&gt; Sulla made himself dictator, passed a [[Constitutional reforms of Sulla|series of constitutional reforms]], resigned the dictatorship, and served one last term as consul. He died in 78.
{{Campaignbox Second Mithridatic War}}

====Pompey's dominance====
{{see also|Second Catilinarian conspiracy}}

The [[Third Servile War|third]] and final uprising was the most serious,&lt;ref&gt;Matyszak, ''The Enemies of Rome'', p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; involving ultimately between 120,000&lt;ref&gt;Appian, Civil Wars, 1, 117&lt;/ref&gt; and 150,000&lt;ref&gt;Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; slaves under the command of the gladiator [[Spartacus]].

{{Campaignbox Third Mithridatic War}}
[[Mithridates the Great]] was the ruler of [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontus]],&lt;ref name="epitomeB3C5"&gt;Florus, ''The Epitome of Roman history'', Book 3, ch. 5&lt;/ref&gt; a large kingdom in [[Asia Minor]] (modern Turkey), from 120 to 63. Mithridates antagonised Rome by seeking to expand his kingdom,&lt;ref name="epitomeB3C5"/&gt; and Rome for its part seemed equally eager for war and the spoils and prestige that it might bring.&lt;ref name="epitomeB3C5"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matyszak, ''The Enemies of Rome'', p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; In 88, Mithridates ordered the killing of a majority of the 80,000 Romans living in his kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; The massacre was the official reason given for the commencement of hostilities in the [[First Mithridatic War]]. The Roman general [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] forced Mithridates out of Greece proper, but then had to return to Italy to answer the internal threat posed by his rival, [[Gaius Marius]]. A peace was made between Rome and Pontus, but this proved only a temporary lull.

The [[Second Mithridatic War]] began when Rome tried to annex a province that Mithridates claimed as his own. In the [[Third Mithridatic War]], first [[Lucullus|Lucius Licinius Lucullus]] and then [[Pompey the Great]] were sent against Mithridates and his [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenian]] ally [[Tigranes the Great]].&lt;ref name="classicalworldP363"&gt;Lane Fox, ''The Classical World'', p. 363&lt;/ref&gt; Mithridates was finally defeated by Pompey in the night-time [[Battle of the Lycus]].&lt;ref name = "Plutarch"&gt;Plutarch, ''Lives'', Pompey&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Campaignbox Rome against the Cilician Pirates}}
The Mediterranean had at this time fallen into the hands of pirates,&lt;ref name = "Plutarch"/&gt; largely from [[Cilicia]].&lt;ref name="epitomeB3C6"&gt;Florus, ''The Epitome of Roman history'', Book 3, ch. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The pirates not only strangled shipping lanes but also plundered many cities on the coasts of Greece and Asia. Pompey was nominated as commander of a special naval task force to campaign against the pirates.&lt;ref name="classicalworldP363"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Plutarch"/&gt; It took Pompey just forty days to clear the western portion of the sea of pirates and restore communication between Iberia (Spain), Africa, and Italy.

In 77, the senate sent one of Sulla's former lieutenants, [[Pompey|Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus]] ("Pompey the Great"), to put down an uprising in Hispania. By 71, Pompey returned to Rome after having completed his mission. Around the same time, another of Sulla's former lieutenants, [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]], had just put down the [[Spartacus]]-led gladiator/slave revolt in Italy. Upon their return, Pompey and Crassus found the ''populares'' party fiercely attacking Sulla's constitution.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 108"&gt;Abbott, 108&lt;/ref&gt; They attempted to forge an agreement with the ''populares'' party. If both Pompey and Crassus were elected consul in 70, they would dismantle the more obnoxious components of Sulla's constitution. The two were soon elected, and quickly dismantled most of Sulla's constitution.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 109"&gt;Abbott, 109&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cicero - Musei Capitolini.JPG|thumb|A Roman marble bust of [[Marcus Tullius Cicero]], Musei Capitolini, Rome]]

Around 66, a movement to use constitutional, or at least peaceful, means to address the plight of various classes began.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 109-110"&gt;Abbott, 109–110&lt;/ref&gt; After several failures, the movement's leaders decided to use any means that were necessary to accomplish their goals. The movement coalesced under an aristocrat named [[Catiline|Lucius Sergius Catilina]]. The movement was based in the town of Faesulae, which was not a natural hotbed of agrarian agitation.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 110"&gt;Abbott, 110&lt;/ref&gt; The rural malcontents were to advance on Rome,&lt;ref name = "Abbott, 111"/&gt; and be aided by an uprising within the city. After assassinating the consuls and most of the senators, Catiline would be free to enact his reforms. The conspiracy was set in motion in 63. The consul for the year, [[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]], intercepted messages that Catiline had sent in an attempt to recruit more members. As a result, the top conspirators in Rome (including at least one former consul) were executed by authorisation (of dubious constitutionality) of the senate, and the planned uprising was disrupted. Cicero then sent an army, which cut Catiline's forces to pieces.

The most important result of the Catilinarian conspiracy was that the ''populares'' party became discredited. The prior 70 years had witnessed a gradual erosion in senatorial powers. The violent nature of the conspiracy, in conjunction with the senate's skill in disrupting it, did a great deal to repair the senate's image.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 111"&gt;Abbott, 111&lt;/ref&gt;

===Triumvirates and end of the Republic (60–27 BC)===

====First Triumvirate (60–50 BC)====
{{Ancient Rome and the fall of the Republic}}
{{Main|First Triumvirate}}
[[File:Pompeius.JPG|thumb|upright|left|A Roman marble head of [[Pompey]] (now in the [[Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek]])]]
In 62, Pompey returned victorious from Asia. The Senate, elated by its successes against Catiline, refused to ratify the arrangements that Pompey had made. Pompey, in effect, became powerless. Thus, when [[Julius Caesar]] returned from a governorship in Spain in 61, he found it easy to make an arrangement with Pompey. Caesar and Pompey, along with Crassus, established a private agreement, now known as the [[First Triumvirate]]. Under the agreement, Pompey's arrangements would be ratified. Caesar would be elected consul in 59, and would then serve as governor of Gaul for five years. Crassus was promised a future consulship.&lt;ref name = "Abbott, 112"/&gt;

By 59 an unofficial political alliance known as the [[First Triumvirate]] was formed between [[Julius Caesar|Gaius Julius Caesar]], [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]], and [[Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus]] ("Pompey the Great") to share power and influence.&lt;ref&gt;Cantor, ''Antiquity'', p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;

Caesar became consul in 59. His colleague, [[Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus]], was an extreme aristocrat. Caesar submitted the laws that he had promised Pompey to the assemblies. Bibulus attempted to obstruct the enactment of these laws, and so Caesar used violent means to ensure their passage.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 112"&gt;Abbott, 112&lt;/ref&gt; Caesar was then made governor of three provinces. He facilitated the election of the former patrician [[Publius Clodius Pulcher]] to the tribunate for 58. Clodius set about depriving Caesar's senatorial enemies of two of their more obstinate leaders in [[Cato the Younger|Cato]] and Cicero. Clodius was a bitter opponent of Cicero because Cicero had testified against him in a sacrilege case. Clodius attempted to try Cicero for executing citizens without a trial during the Catiline conspiracy, resulting in Cicero going into self-imposed exile and his house in Rome being burnt down. Clodius also passed a bill that forced Cato to lead the invasion of Cyprus which would keep him away from Rome for some years. Clodius also passed a law to expand the previous partial grain subsidy to a fully free grain dole for citizens.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 113"&gt;Abbott, 113&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Caesar campaigns gaul-en.svg|left|thumb|upright=1.35|Map of the Gallic Wars]]
{{Campaignbox Gallic Wars}}
During his term as praetor in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] (modern Portugal and Spain), Pompey's contemporary [[Julius Caesar]] defeated two local tribes in battle.&lt;ref name="livescaesar"&gt;Plutarch, ''Lives'', Caesar&lt;/ref&gt; After his term as consul in 59, he was appointed to a five-year term as the proconsular Governor of Cisalpine Gaul (part of current northern Italy), Transalpine Gaul (current southern France) and Illyria (part of the modern Balkans).&lt;ref name="livescaesar"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Not content with an idle governorship, Caesar strove to find reason to invade Gaul (modern France and Belgium), which would give him the dramatic military success he sought. When two local tribes began to migrate on a route that would take them near (not into) the Roman province of Transalpine Gaul, Caesar had the barely sufficient excuse he needed for his [[Gallic Wars]], fought between 58 and 49.

Caesar defeated large armies at major battles 58 and 57. In 55 and 54 he made [[Caesar's invasions of Britain|two expeditions into Britain]], the first Roman to do so. Caesar then defeated a union of Gauls at the [[Battle of Alesia]],&lt;ref name="stormingP62"&gt;Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 62 See also: Goldsworthy, ''In the Name of Rome'', p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; completing the Roman conquest of Transalpine Gaul. By 50, all of Gaul lay in Roman hands.

In 53, Crassus launched a Roman invasion of the Parthian Empire (modern Iraq and Iran). After initial successes,&lt;ref name="enemiesP133"&gt;Matyszak, ''The Enemies of Rome'', p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; he marched his army deep into the desert;&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Lives of the Noble Grecians and Romans'', p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; but here his army was cut off deep in enemy territory, surrounded and slaughtered at the [[Battle of Carrhae]] in which Crassus himself perished. The death of Crassus removed some of the balance in the Triumvirate and, consequently, Caesar and Pompey began to move apart. While Caesar was fighting in Gaul, Pompey proceeded with a legislative agenda for Rome that revealed that he was at best ambivalent towards Caesar&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy, ''In the Name of Rome'', p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; and perhaps now covertly allied with Caesar's political enemies. In 51, some Roman senators demanded that Caesar not be permitted to stand for consul unless he turned over control of his armies to the state, which would have left Caesar defenceless before his enemies. Caesar chose civil war over laying down his command and facing trial.

Clodius formed armed gangs that terrorised the city and eventually began to attack Pompey's followers, who in response funded counter-gangs formed by [[Titus Annius Milo]]. The political alliance of the triumvirate was crumbling. Domitius [[Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 54 BC)|Ahenobarbus]] ran for the consulship in 55 promising to take Caesar's command from him. Eventually, the triumvirate was renewed at Lucca. Pompey and Crassus were promised the consulship in 55, and Caesar's term as governor was extended for five years. Crassus led an ill-fated expedition with legions led by his son, Caesar's lieutenant, against the Kingdom of Parthia. This resulted in his defeat and death at the [[Battle of Carrhae]]. Finally, Pompey's wife, Julia, who was Caesar's daughter, died in childbirth. This event severed the last remaining bond between Pompey and Caesar.

Beginning in the summer of 54, a wave of political corruption and violence swept Rome.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 114"&gt;Abbott, 114&lt;/ref&gt; This chaos reached a climax in January of 52 BC, when Clodius was murdered in a gang war by Milo.

====Caesar's Civil War and dictatorship (49–44 BC)====
{{Campaignbox Caesar's Civil War}}
[[File:04305 - Roma - Fori - Curia Iulia - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto - 18-Mar-2008.jpg|thumb|The [[Curia Julia]], the [[Roman Senate]] house established by Julius Caesar in 44 BC and completed by [[Octavian]] in 29 BC, replacing the [[Curia Cornelia]] as the meeting place of the Senate]]
{{Main|Assassination of Julius Caesar}}

On 1 January 49, an agent of Caesar presented an ultimatum to the senate. The ultimatum was rejected, and the senate then passed a resolution which declared that if Caesar did not lay down his arms by July of that year, he would be considered an enemy of the Republic.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 115"&gt;Abbott, 115&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the senators adopted Pompey as their new champion against Caesar. On 7 January of 49, the senate passed a ''senatus consultum ultimum'', which vested Pompey with dictatorial powers. Pompey's army, however, was composed largely of untested conscripts. On 10 January, Caesar crossed the [[Rubicon]] with his veteran army (in violation of Roman laws) and marched towards Rome. Caesar's rapid advance forced Pompey, the consuls and the senate to abandon Rome for Greece. Caesar entered the city unopposed.

By the spring of 49, the hardened legions of Caesar crossed the river [[Rubicon]], the legal boundary of Roman Italy beyond which no commander might bring his army, and swept down the Italian peninsula towards Rome, while Pompey ordered the abandonment of Rome. Afterwards Caesar turned his attention to the Pompeian stronghold of Hispania (modern Spain)&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy, ''In the Name of Rome'', p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; but decided to tackle Pompey himself in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Julius Caesar, ''The Civil War'', 81–92 See also: Goldsworthy, ''In the Name of Rome'', p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; Pompey initially defeated Caesar, but failed to follow up on the victory, and was decisively defeated at the [[Battle of Pharsalus]] in 48,&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy, ''In the Name of Rome'', p. 227 See also: Lane Fox, ''The Classical World'', p. 403&lt;/ref&gt; despite outnumbering Caesar's forces two to one, albeit with inferior quality troops.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, ''Rubicon'', p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; Pompey fled again, this time to Egypt, where he was murdered.

Pompey's death did not end the civil war, as Caesar's many enemies fought on. In 46 Caesar lost perhaps as much as a third of his army, but ultimately came back to defeat the Pompeian army of [[Metellus Scipio]] in the [[Battle of Thapsus]], after which the Pompeians retreated yet again to Hispania. Caesar then defeated the combined Pompeian forces at the [[Battle of Munda]].

With Pompey defeated and order restored, Caesar wanted to achieve undisputed control over the government. The powers which he gave himself were later assumed by his imperial successors.&lt;ref name = "Abbott, 134"/&gt; His assumption of these powers decreased the authority of Rome's other political institutions.

Caesar held both the dictatorship and the tribunate, and alternated between the consulship and the proconsulship.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 134"&gt;Abbott, 134&lt;/ref&gt; In 48, Caesar was given permanent tribunician powers. This made his person sacrosanct, gave him the power to veto the senate, and allowed him to dominate the Plebeian Council. In 46, Caesar was given censorial powers,&lt;ref name="Abbott, 135"&gt;Abbott, 135&lt;/ref&gt; which he used to fill the senate with his own partisans. Caesar then raised the membership of the Senate to 900.&lt;ref name = "Abbott, 137"/&gt; This robbed the senatorial aristocracy of its prestige, and made it increasingly subservient to him. While the assemblies continued to meet, he submitted all candidates to the assemblies for election, and all bills to the assemblies for enactment. Thus, the assemblies became powerless and were unable to oppose him.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 138"&gt;Abbott, 138&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the end of his life, Caesar began to prepare for a war against the [[Parthian Empire]]. Since his absence from Rome would limit his ability to install his own consuls, he passed a law before his death which allowed him to appoint all magistrates, and later all consuls and tribunes. This transformed the magistrates from representatives of the people to representatives of the dictator.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 137"&gt;Abbott, 137&lt;/ref&gt;

Caesar was now the primary figure of the Roman state, enforcing and entrenching his powers. His enemies feared that he had ambitions to become an autocratic ruler. Arguing that the Roman Republic was in danger, a group of senators hatched a conspiracy and [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|assassinated Caesar]] at a meeting of the Senate in March 44.&lt;ref name="antiquityP170"&gt;Cantor, ''Antiquity'', p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;

Caesar was assassinated on 15 March 44. The assassination was led by [[Gaius Cassius]] and [[Marcus Brutus]]. Most of the conspirators were senators, who had a variety of economic, political, or personal motivations for carrying out the assassination. Many were afraid that Caesar would soon resurrect the monarchy and declare himself king. Others feared loss of property or prestige as Caesar carried out his land reforms in favor of the landless classes. Virtually all the conspirators fled the city after Caesar's death in fear of retaliation. The civil war that followed destroyed what was left of the Republic.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 133"&gt;Abbott, 133&lt;/ref&gt;

====Second Triumvirate====
[[Mark Antony]], Caesar's lieutenant, condemned Caesar's assassination, and war broke out between the two factions. Antony was denounced as a public enemy, and Caesar's adopted son and chosen heir, [[Augustus|Gaius Octavianus]], was entrusted with the command of the war against him. At the [[Battle of Mutina]] Mark Antony was defeated by the consuls [[Hirtius]] and [[Gaius Vibius Pansa Caetronianus|Pansa]], who were both killed.

Octavian came to terms with Caesarians Antony and [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Marcus Aemilius Lepidus]] in 43 when the [[Second Triumvirate]] was formed.&lt;ref name="Goldsworthy, p. 237"/&gt; In 42 Mark Antony and Octavian fought the [[Battle of Philippi]] against Caesar's assassins [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Brutus]] and [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]]. Although Brutus defeated Octavian, Antony defeated Cassius, who committed suicide. Brutus did likewise soon afterwards.

After the assassination, [[Mark Antony|Marcus Antonius]] (Mark Antony) formed an alliance with Caesar's adopted son and great-nephew, [[Augustus|Gaius Octavianus]] (Octavian). Along with [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Marcus Lepidus]], they formed an alliance known as the [[Second Triumvirate]].&lt;ref name="Goldsworthy, p. 237"&gt;Goldsworthy, ''In the Name of Rome'', p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; They held powers that were nearly identical to the powers that Caesar had held under his constitution. As such, the Senate and assemblies remained powerless, even after Caesar had been assassinated. The conspirators were then defeated at the [[Battle of Philippi]] in 42. Eventually, however, Antony and Octavian fought against each other in one last battle. Antony was defeated in the naval [[Battle of Actium]] in 31, and he committed suicide with his lover, [[Cleopatra]]. In 29, Octavian returned to Rome as the unchallenged master of the Empire and later accepted the title of [[Augustus]] ("Exalted One"). He was convinced that only a single strong ruler could restore order in Rome.

However, civil war flared again when the Second Triumvirate of Octavian, Lepidus and Mark Antony failed. The ambitious Octavian built a power base of patronage and then launched a campaign against Mark Antony.&lt;ref name="antiquityP170"/&gt; At the naval [[Battle of Actium]] in 31 off the coast of Greece, Octavian decisively defeated Antony and [[Cleopatra VII of Egypt|Cleopatra]] of [[Ptolemaic Egypt]]. Octavian was granted a series of special powers including sole "imperium" within the city of Rome, permanent consular powers and credit for every Roman military victory, since all future generals were assumed to be acting under his command. In 27 Octavian was granted the use of the names "Augustus", indicating his primary status above all other Romans, "Princeps", which he used to refer to himself as in public, and he adopted the title "Imperator Caesar" making him the first Roman Emperor.&lt;ref name="grandP7"&gt;Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire'', p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constitutional system==
{{Roman government}}
{{Main|Constitution of the Roman Republic}}
{{Main|History of the Constitution of the Roman Republic}}
{{further|Elections in the Roman Republic}}
The constitutional history of the Roman Republic began with the revolution which overthrew the [[Roman Kingdom|monarchy]] in 509, and ended with constitutional reforms that transformed the Republic into what would effectively be the Roman Empire, in 27.  The Constitution of the Roman Republic was a constantly-evolving, unwritten set of guidelines and principles passed down mainly through precedent, by which the government and its politics operated.&lt;ref name="Byrd, 161"&gt;Byrd, 161&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout the history of the Republic, changes in the constitution were driven by [[Conflict of the Orders|conflicts of interest]] between the aristocracy and ordinary citizens.

===Senate===
{{Main|Senate of the Roman Republic}}
The [[Senate of the Roman Republic|senate's]] ultimate authority derived from the esteem and prestige of the senators.&lt;ref name="Byrd, 96"&gt;Byrd, 96&lt;/ref&gt; This esteem and prestige was based on both precedent and custom, as well as the caliber and reputation of the senators. The senate passed decrees, which were called ''senatus consulta''. These were officially "advice" from the senate to a magistrate. In practice, however, they were usually followed by the magistrates.&lt;ref name="Byrd, 44"&gt;Byrd, 44&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of the Roman senate was usually directed towards foreign policy. Though it technically had no official role in the management of military conflict, the senate ultimately was the force that oversaw such affairs. The power of the senate expanded over time as the power of the legislative assemblies declined, and the senate took a greater role in ordinary law-making. Its members were usually appointed by [[Roman Censors]], who ordinarily selected newly elected magistrates for membership in the senate, making the senate a partially elected body. During times of military emergency, such as the civil wars of the 1st century, this practice became less prevalent, as the [[Roman Dictator]], [[Triumvir]] or the senate itself would select its members.  Towards the end of the Republic, the senate could enact a ''[[Senatus consultum ultimum|senatus consultus ultimum]]'' in times of emergency, instead of appointing a dictator.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018|reason=Your explanation here}}

===Legislative assemblies===
[[File:Forum Romanum through Arch of Septimius Severus Forum Romanum Rome.jpg|thumb|The [[Roman Forum]], the commercial, cultural, religious, and political center of the city and the Republic which housed the various offices and meeting places of the government]]

{{Main|Legislative Assemblies of the Roman Republic}}

The legal status of Roman citizenship was limited and was a vital prerequisite to possessing many important legal rights such as the right to trial and appeal, to marry, to vote, to hold office, to enter binding contracts, and to special tax exemptions. An adult male citizen with the full complement of legal and political rights was called "optimo jure." The optimo jure elected their assemblies, whereupon the assemblies elected magistrates, enacted legislation, presided over trials in capital cases, declared war and peace, and forged or dissolved treaties. There were [[Legislative Assemblies of the Roman Republic#Comitia, Concilium, Conventio|two types of legislative assemblies]]. The first was the ''comitia'' ("committees"),&lt;ref name="Lintott, 42"&gt;Lintott, 42&lt;/ref&gt; which were assemblies of all optimo jure. The second was the ''concilia'' ("councils"), which were assemblies of specific groups of optimo jure.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 251"&gt;Abbott, 251&lt;/ref&gt;

Citizens were organized on the basis of centuries and [[Tribe of Rome|tribes]], which would each gather into their own assemblies. The [[Legislative Assemblies of the Roman Republic#Assembly of the Centuries|Comitia Centuriata]] ("Centuriate Assembly") was the assembly of the centuries (i.e., soldiers). The president of the Comitia Centuriata was usually a consul. The centuries would vote, one at a time, until a measure received support from a majority of the centuries. The Comitia Centuriata would elect magistrates who had the ''imperium'' powers (consuls and praetors). It also elected censors. Only the Comitia Centuriata could declare war, and ratify the results of a census.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 257"&gt;Abbott, 257&lt;/ref&gt; It also served as the highest court of appeal in certain judicial cases.

The assembly of the tribes (i.e., the citizens of Rome), the [[Legislative Assemblies of the Roman Republic#Assembly of the Tribes|Comitia Tributa]], was presided over by a consul, and was composed of 35 tribes. The tribes were not ethnic or kinship groups, but rather geographical subdivisions.&lt;ref name="Lintott, 51"&gt;Lintott, 51&lt;/ref&gt; The order that the thirty-five tribes would vote in was selected randomly by lot.&lt;ref name="Taylor, 77"&gt;Taylor, 77&lt;/ref&gt; Once a measure received support from a majority of the tribes, the voting would end. While it did not pass many laws, the Comitia Tributa did elect quaestors, [[Curule seat|curule]] [[aedile]]s, and military tribunes.&lt;ref name="Taylor, 7"&gt;Taylor, 7&lt;/ref&gt; The Plebeian Council&lt;ref name="Abbott, 196"&gt;Abbott, 196&lt;/ref&gt; was identical to the assembly of the tribes, but excluded the [[patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]]. They elected their own officers, plebeian tribunes and plebeian aediles. Usually a plebeian tribune would preside over the assembly. This assembly passed most laws, and could also act as a court of appeal.

===Magistrates===
{{Main|Executive Magistrates of the Roman Republic}}
Each republican magistrate held certain [[Executive Magistrates of the Roman Republic#Powers|constitutional powers]]. In addition, each was assigned a ''provincia'' by the Senate.  This was the scope of that particular office holder's authority.  It could apply to a geographic area or to a particular responsibility or task.&lt;ref name="Lintott, 101"&gt;Lintott, ''Constitution of the Roman Republic'', p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;  The powers of a magistrate came from the people of Rome (both plebeians ''and'' patricians).&lt;ref name="Lintott, 95"&gt;Lintott, ''Constitution of the Roman Republic'', p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[imperium]]'' was held by both consuls and praetors. Strictly speaking, it was the authority to command a military force.  In reality, however, it carried broad authority in the other public spheres such as diplomacy, and the justice system. In extreme cases, those with the imperium power were able to sentence Roman Citizens to death. All magistrates also had the power of ''coercitio'' (coercion). This was used by magistrates to maintain public order by imposing punishment for crimes.&lt;ref name="Lintott, 97"&gt;Lintott, ''Constitution of the Roman Republic'', p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Magistrates also had both the power and the duty to look for omens. This power could also be used to obstruct political opponents.

One check on a magistrate's power was called ''Collega'' (collegiality). Each magisterial office would be held concurrently by at least two people. Another such check was ''provocatio''. While in Rome, all citizens were protected from coercion, by ''provocatio'', which was an early form of [[due process]]. It was a precursor to ''[[habeas corpus]]''. If any magistrate tried to use the powers of the state against a citizen, that citizen could appeal the decision of the magistrate to a tribune. In addition, once a magistrate's one-year term of office expired, he would have to [[Cursus honorum|wait ten years]] before serving in that office again. This created problems for some consuls and praetors, and these magistrates would occasionally have their ''imperium'' extended. In effect, they would retain the powers of the office (as a [[promagistrate]]), without officially holding that office.&lt;ref name="Lintott, 113"&gt;Lintott, 113&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Roman consul|consuls]] of the Roman Republic were the highest ranking ordinary magistrates.  Each served for one year.&lt;ref&gt;Byrd, 20&lt;/ref&gt;  They retained several elements of the former kingly regalia, such as the ''[[toga praetexta]]'', and the ''[[fasces]]'', which represented the power to inflict physical punishment. Consular powers included the kings' former "power to command" (''[[imperium]]'') and appointment of new senators. Consuls had supreme power in both civil and military matters. While in the city of Rome, the consuls were the head of the Roman government. They would preside over the senate and the assemblies. While abroad, each consul would command an army.&lt;ref name="Byrd, 179"&gt;Byrd, 179&lt;/ref&gt; His authority abroad would be nearly absolute. [[Praetor]]s administered civil law&lt;ref name="Byrd, 32"&gt;Byrd, 32&lt;/ref&gt; and commanded provincial armies. Every five years, two [[Roman Censor|censors]] were elected for an 18-month term, during which they would conduct a [[census]]. During the census, they could enroll citizens in the senate, or purge them from the senate.&lt;ref name="Byrd, 26"&gt;Byrd, 26&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aediles]] were officers elected to conduct domestic affairs in Rome, such as managing public games and shows. The [[quaestor]]s would usually assist the consuls in Rome, and the governors in the provinces. Their duties were often financial.

Since the tribunes were considered to be the embodiment of the plebeians, they were [[sacrosanct]]. Their sacrosanctity was enforced by a pledge, taken by the plebeians, to kill any person who harmed or interfered with a tribune during his term of office. It was a capital offense to harm a tribune, to disregard his veto, or to otherwise interfere with him.&lt;ref name="Byrd, 23"&gt;Byrd, 23&lt;/ref&gt; In times of military emergency, a [[Roman dictator|dictator]] would be appointed for a term of six months.&lt;ref name="Byrd, 24"&gt;Byrd, 24&lt;/ref&gt; Constitutional government would be dissolved, and the dictator would be the absolute master of the state. When the dictator's term ended, constitutional government would be restored.

==Military==
{{RomanMilitary}}
{{Main|Structural history of the Roman military}}
Rome's military secured Rome's territory and borders, and helped to impose tribute on conquered peoples. Rome's armies had a formidable reputation; but Rome also "produced [its] share of incompetents"&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy, ''In the Name of Rome'', p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; and catastrophic defeats. Nevertheless, it was generally the fate of Rome's greatest enemies, such as [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]] and [[Hannibal]],&lt;ref&gt;Lane Fox, ''The Classical World'', p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; to win early battles but lose the war.

===Hoplite armies (509–c. 315 BC)===
{{Main|Phalanx}}
During this period, Roman soldiers seem to have been modelled after those of the [[Etruscans]] to the north,&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas V Sekunda, ''Early Roman Armies'', p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; who themselves are believed to have copied [[phalanx formation|their style of warfare]] from the Greeks. Traditionally, the introduction of the [[phalanx formation]] into the Roman army is ascribed to the city's penultimate king, [[Servius Tullius]] (ruled 578-534).&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas V Sekunda, ''Early Roman Armies'', p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Livy]]&lt;ref&gt;Livy, i. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]],&lt;ref&gt;''Roman Antiquities'', 4.16–18&lt;/ref&gt; the front rank was composed of the wealthiest citizens, who were able to purchase the best equipment. Each subsequent rank consisted of those with less wealth and poorer equipment than the one before it. The phalanx was effective in large, open spaces, but not on the hilly terrain of the central [[Italian peninsula]]. In the 4th century, the Romans replaced it with the more flexible manipular formation. This change is sometimes attributed to [[Marcus Furius Camillus]] and placed shortly after the [[Battle of the Allia|Gallic invasion]] of 390; more likely, it was copied from Rome's [[Samnium|Samnite]] enemies to the south,&lt;ref&gt;''Early Roman Armies'', pp. 37–38.&lt;/ref&gt; following the [[Samnite Wars|Second Samnite War]] (326-304).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history-world.org/samnite_wars.htm |title=Rome, The Samnite Wars |publisher=History-world.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manipular legion (c. 315–107 BC)===
[[File:Altar Domitius Ahenobarbus Louvre n3.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.8|Detail from the [[Altar of Domitius Ahenobarbus|Ahenobarbus relief]] showing (centre-right) two Roman foot-soldiers ca. 122 BC. Note the [[Montefortino helmet|Montefortino-style helmets]] with horsehair plume, [[chain mail]] cuirasses with shoulder reinforcement, oval shields with calfskin covers, ''[[gladius]]'' and ''[[pilum]].'']]

During this period, an army formation of around 5,000 men (of both heavy and light infantry) was known as a legion. The manipular army was based upon social class, age and military experience.&lt;ref&gt;Boak, '' A History of Rome to 565 A.D.'', p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; ''Maniples'' were units of 120 men each drawn from a single infantry class. They were typically deployed into three discrete lines based on the three [[heavy infantry]] types:

* 1. The first line maniple were the [[Hastati|''hastati'']], leather-armoured infantry soldiers who wore a bronze breastplate and a bronze helmet adorned with 3 feathers approximately {{convert|30|cm|0|abbr=on}} in height and carried an iron-clad wooden shield. They were armed with a sword and two throwing spears.
* 2. The second line were the ''[[principes]]''. They were armed and armoured in the same manner as the hastati, but wore a lighter coat of mail rather than a solid brass breastplate.
* 3. The ''[[triarii]]'' formed the third line.  They were the last remnant of the hoplite-style troops in the Roman army. They were armed and armoured like the ''principes'', with the exception that they carried a lighter spear.&lt;ref name="polybiusB6"&gt;PolybiusB6&lt;/ref&gt;

The three infantry classes&lt;ref name="santosuossoP18"&gt;Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; may have retained some slight parallel to social divisions within Roman society, but at least officially the three lines were based upon age and experience rather than social class. Young, unproven men would serve in the first line, older men with some military experience would serve in the second line, and veteran troops of advanced age and experience would serve in the third line.

The heavy infantry of the maniples were supported by a number of light infantry and cavalry troops, typically 300 horsemen per manipular legion.&lt;ref name="santosuossoP18"/&gt; The cavalry was drawn primarily from the richest class of equestrians. There was an additional class of troops who followed the army without specific martial roles and were deployed to the rear of the third line. Their role in accompanying the army was primarily to supply any vacancies that might occur in the maniples. The light infantry consisted of 1,200 unarmoured skirmishing troops drawn from the youngest and lower social classes. They were armed with a sword and a small shield, as well as several light javelins.

Rome's military confederation with the other peoples of the Italian peninsula meant that half of Rome's army was provided by the [[Socii]], such as the Etruscans, Umbrians, Apulians, Campanians, Samnites, Lucani, Bruttii, and the various southern Greek cities. Polybius states that Rome could draw on 770,000 men at the beginning of the Second Punic War, of which 700,000 were infantry and 70,000 met the requirements for cavalry. Rome's Italian allies would be organized in ''alae'', or ''wings'', roughly equal in manpower to the Roman legions, though with 900 cavalry instead of 300.

A small navy had operated at a fairly low level after about 300, but it was massively upgraded about forty years later, during the [[First Punic War]]. After a period of frenetic construction, the navy mushroomed to a size of more than 400 ships on the [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] ("Punic") pattern. Once completed, it could accommodate up to 100,000 sailors and embarked troops for battle. The navy thereafter declined in size.&lt;ref name="websterP156"&gt;Webster, ''The Roman Imperial Army'', p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;

The extraordinary demands of the [[Punic Wars]], in addition to a shortage of manpower, exposed the tactical weaknesses of the manipular legion, at least in the short term.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, ''Service in the Post-Marian Roman Army'', p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; In 217, near the beginning of the [[Second Punic War]], Rome was forced to effectively ignore its long-standing principle that its soldiers must be both citizens and property owners. During the 2nd century, Roman territory saw an overall decline in population,&lt;ref name="gabbaP9"&gt;Gabba, ''Republican Rome, The Army and The Allies'', p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; partially due to the huge losses incurred during various wars. This was accompanied by severe social stresses and the greater collapse of the middle classes. As a result, the Roman state was forced to arm its soldiers at the expense of the state, which it did not have to do in the past.

The distinction between the heavy infantry types began to blur, perhaps because the state was now assuming the responsibility of providing standard-issue equipment. In addition, the shortage of available manpower led to a greater burden being placed upon Rome's allies for the provision of allied troops.&lt;ref&gt;Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the Romans were forced to begin hiring mercenaries to fight alongside the legions.&lt;ref&gt;Webster, ''The Roman Imperial Army'', p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legion after the reforms of Gaius Marius (107–27 BC)===
{{Main|Roman army of the late Republic}}
In a process known as the [[Marian reforms]], Roman consul [[Gaius Marius]] carried out a programme of reform of the Roman military.&lt;ref&gt;Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; In 107, all citizens, regardless of their wealth or social class, were made eligible for entry into the Roman army. This move formalised and concluded a gradual process that had been growing for centuries, of removing property requirements for military service.&lt;ref&gt;Gabba, ''Republican Rome, The Army And the Allies'', p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction among the three heavy infantry classes, which had already become blurred, had collapsed into a single class of heavy legionary infantry. The heavy infantry legionaries were drawn from citizen stock, while non-citizens came to dominate the ranks of the light infantry. The army's higher-level officers and commanders were still drawn exclusively from the Roman aristocracy.&lt;ref name="SantosuossoP29"&gt;SantosuossoP29&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike earlier in the Republic, legionaries were no longer fighting on a seasonal basis to protect their land. Instead, they received standard pay, and were employed by the state on a fixed-term basis. As a consequence, military duty began to appeal most to the poorest sections of society, to whom a salaried pay was attractive. A destabilising consequence of this development was that the proletariat "acquired a stronger and more elevated position"&lt;ref name="gabbaP25"&gt;Gabba, ''Republican Rome, The Army and The Allies'', p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; within the state.

The legions of the late Republic were almost entirely heavy infantry. The main legionary sub-unit was a ''[[Cohort (military unit)|cohort]]'' of approximately 480 infantrymen, further divided into six [[Centuria#Military|centuries]] of 80 men each.&lt;ref name="luttwakP14"&gt;Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire'', p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Each century comprised 10 "tent groups" of 8 men. Cavalry were used as scouts and dispatch riders, rather than as battlefield forces.&lt;ref&gt;Webster, ''The Roman Imperial Army'', p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; Legions also contained a dedicated group of artillery crew of perhaps 60 men. Each legion was normally partnered with an approximately equal number of allied (non-Roman) troops.&lt;ref name="luttwakP15"&gt;Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire'', p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

The army's most obvious deficiency lay in its shortage of cavalry, especially heavy cavalry.&lt;ref&gt;Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire'', p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly in the East, Rome's slow-moving infantry legions were often confronted by fast-moving cavalry-troops, and found themselves at a tactical disadvantage.

Following Rome's subjugation of the Mediterranean, its navy declined in size although it would undergo short-term upgrading and revitalisation in the late Republic to meet several new demands. [[Julius Caesar]] assembled a fleet to cross the [[English Channel]] and invade ''[[Britannia]]''. [[Pompey]] raised a fleet to deal with the [[Cilicia]]n pirates who threatened Rome's Mediterranean trading routes. During the civil war that followed, as many as a thousand ships were either constructed or pressed into service from Greek cities.&lt;ref name="websterP156"/&gt;

==Social structure==
{{Main|Social class in ancient Rome}}
Citizen families were headed by the family's oldest male, the ''[[pater familias]]'', who was lawfully entitled to exercise complete authority (''[[patria potestas]]'') over family property and all family members. Brutus, co-founder of the Republic, is supposed to have exercised the extreme form of this right when he executed his own sons for treachery.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, ''Beginnings of Rome,'' pp. 215-216.&lt;/ref&gt; Citizenship offered legal protection and rights, but citizens who offended Rome's traditional [[Mos maiorum|moral code]] could be declared [[Infamia|infamous]], and lose certain legal and social privileges.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A.J. McGinn, ''Prostitution, Sexuality and the Law in Ancient Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 65ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Citizenship was also taxable, and undischarged debt was potentially a capital offence. A form of limited, theoretically voluntary slavery (debt bondage, or [[nexum]]) allowed wealthy creditors to negotiate payment of debt through bonded service. Poor, landless citizens of the lowest class (''proletarii'') might contract their sons to a creditor, patron or third party employer to obtain an income, or to pay off family debts. ''Nexum'' was only abolished when slave labour became more readily available, most notably during the Punic wars.&lt;ref&gt;Drummond, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7, part 2, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, ''Beginnings of Rome,'' pp. 238, 379-380, citing Livy, 9. 46. 13-14 for the poorest citizens as ''forensis facto... humillimi'' (the "lowest of the low").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alföldy, Geza, ''The Social History of Rome'', p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Slaves were simultaneously family members and family property. They could be bought, sold, acquired through warfare, or born and raised within their master's household,. They could also buy their freedom with money saved or the offer of future services as a freedman or woman, and their sons could be eligible for citizenship; this degree of social mobility was unusual in the ancient world. Freed slaves and the master who freed them retained certain legal and moral mutual obligations. This was the bottom rung of one of Rome's fundamental social and economic institutions, the [[Patronage in ancient Rome|client-patron relationship]]. At the top rung were the senatorial families of the landowning nobility, both patrician and plebeian, bound by shifting allegiances and mutual competition. A plebiscite of 218 forbade senators and their sons to engage in substantial trade or money-lending.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, ''Beginnings of Rome,'' pp. 288-291.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flower, ''Cambridge Companion to the Roman Republic'', pp. 173-175; Flower is describing the restrictions placed on Senatorial business activity by the ''plebiscitum Claudianum'' of 218 BC, and related legislation: it may have been intended to reduce opportunity for bribery and corruption, or to help Senators focus exclusively on their tasks in government.&lt;/ref&gt; A wealthy equestrian class emerged, not subject to the same trading constraints as the senate.&lt;ref&gt;D'Arms, J. B., "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/4238697 Senators' Involvement in Commerce in the Late Republic: Some Ciceronian Evidence]", Memoirs of the American Academy in Rome, Vol. 36, ''The Seaborne Commerce of Ancient Rome: Studies in Archaeology and History'' (1980), pp. 77-89, University of Michigan Press for the American Academy in Rome.&lt;/ref&gt;

Citizen men and [[Women in ancient Rome|citizen women]] were expected to marry, produce as many children as possible, and improve - or at worst, conserve - their family's wealth, fortune, and public profile. [[Marriage in ancient Rome|Marriage]] offered opportunities for political alliance and social advancement. Patricians usually married in a form known as ''[[confarreatio]]'', which transferred the bride from her father's absolute control or "hand" (''manus'') to that of her husband.&lt;ref&gt;David Johnston, ''Roman Law in Context'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999), pp. 33-34.&lt;/ref&gt; Patrician status could only be inherited through birth; an early [[Twelve Tables|law]], introduced by the reactionary [[Decemviri]] but rescinded in 445, sought to prevent marriages between patricians and plebeians; any resulting offspring may not have been legally recognised.&lt;ref&gt;The plebeian involved in a such a marriage would likely have been wealthy: see Cornell, ''The beginnings of Rome'', p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt; Among ordinary plebeians, different marriage forms offered married women considerable more freedom than their patrician counterparts, until ''manus'' marriage was replaced by ''free marriage'', in which the wife remained under the legal authority of her absent father, not her husband.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce W. Frier and Thomas A.J. McGinn, ''A Casebook on Roman Family Law'' (Oxford University Press, 2004), pp. 20, 53, 54. Plebeian marriage forms include ''coemptio'' (marriage "by purchase" - a form of dowry), and ''usus'' (marriage recognised through the couple's "habitual cohabitation")&lt;/ref&gt; Infant mortality was high. Towards the end of the Republic, the birthrate began to fall among the elite. Some wealthy, childless citizens resorted to [[Adoption in ancient Rome|adoption]] to provide male heirs for their estates, and to forge political alliances. Adoption was subject to the senate's approval; the notoriously unconventional patrician politician [[Publius Clodius Pulcher]] had himself and his family adopted into a plebeian clan, so that he could hold a plebeian tribunate.

==Trade and economy==
===Farming===
{{Main|Roman agriculture}}
The Republic was created during a time of warfare, economic recession, food shortages, and plebeian debt. In wartime, plebeian farmers were liable to conscription. In peacetime, most depended on whatever cereal crops they could produce on small farming plots, allotted to them by the state, or by patrons. Soil fertility varied from place to place, and natural water sources were unevenly distributed throughout the landscape. In good years, a pleb small-holder might trade a small surplus, to meet his family's needs, or to buy the armatures required for his military service. In other years, crop failure through soil exhaustion, adverse weather, disease or military incursions could lead to poverty, unsupported borrowing, and debt. Nobles invested much of their wealth in ever-larger, more efficient farming units, exploiting a range of soil conditions though mixed farming techniques. As farming was labour-intensive, and military conscription reduced the pool of available manpower, the wealthy increasingly resorted to slave-labour.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, ''Beginnings of Rome,'' pp. 265-268, 283.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bannon, pp. 5"&gt;Bannon, ''Gardens and Neighbors'', pp. 5−10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drummond, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7, part 2, pp. 118-122, 135, 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Well managed agricultural estates helped provide for clients and dependents, support an urban family home, and fund the owner's public and military career. Large estates yielded cash for bribes, and security for borrowing. Later Roman moralists idealised farming as an intrinsically noble occupation: [[Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus#First dictatorship|Cincinnatus]] left off his ploughing reluctantly, to serve as [[Roman dictator|dictator]], and returned once his state duties were done.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, iii. 26-29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7, part 2, pp. 412-413: [[Cato the Elder]] dwelt upon the probably mythical poverty of leading Romans such as [[Manius Curius Dentatus|Manius Dentatus]], and the incorruptible [[Gaius Fabricius Luscinus]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosenstein, Nathan, "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/20430663 Aristocrats and Agriculture in the Middle and Late Republic]", ''The Journal of Roman Studies'', Vol. 98 (2008), pp. 1-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In law, land taken by conquest was ''[[ager publicus]]'' (public land). In practise, much of it was exploited by the nobility, using slaves rather than free labour. Rome's expansionist wars and colonisations were at least partly driven by the land-hunger of displaced peasants, who must otherwise join the swelling, dependent population of urban ''plebs''.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, ''Beginnings of Rome,'' pp. 265-268.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the second Punic War, Rome added the fertile ''ager Campanus'', suitable for intense cultivation of vines, olives and cereals. Like the grain-fields of Sicily - seized after the same conflict - it was likely farmed extra-legally by leading landowners, using slave-gangs. A portion of Sicily's grain harvest was sent to Rome as [[tribute]], for redistribution by the ''aediles''.&lt;ref&gt;Gabba, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 8, pp. 197-198.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lintott, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 9, p. 55: A later consular investigation into similar land-encroachments is dated to 175.&lt;/ref&gt;  The urban ''plebs'' increasingly relied on firstly subsidised, then free grain.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, ''Beginnings of Rome,'' pp. 328-329.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Esquilino - acquedotto Anio Vetus 1000968.JPG|thumb|Ruins of the [[Aqua Anio Vetus]], a [[Roman aqueduct]] built in 272 BC]]
With the introduction of aqueducts (from 312), suburban market-farms could be supplied with run-off or waste aqueduct water. Perishable commodities such as flowers (for perfumes, and festival garlands), fresh grapes, vegetables and orchard fruits, and small livestock such as pigs and chickens, could be farmed close to municipal and urban markets.&lt;ref name="Bannon, pp. 5"/&gt; In the early 2nd century [[Cato the Elder]] tried to block the illicit tapping of rural aqueducts by the elite, who thus exploited the increased productivity of cheaply bought, formerly "dry" farmland; a law was duly passed, but fines for abuses, and taxes on profits, proved more realistic solutions than an outright ban. Food surpluses, no matter how obtained, kept prices low.&lt;ref&gt;Bannon, ''Gardens and Neighbors'', pp. 5−10; citing Hodge, ''Roman Aqueducts'', p. 219 for Cato's diatribe against the misuse of aqueduct water by [[Lucius Furius Purpureo|L. Furius Purpureus]], consul in 196.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicolet, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 9, p. 619.&lt;/ref&gt; Faced with increasing competition from provincial and allied grain suppliers, many Roman farmers turned to more profitable crops, especially grapes for wine production. By the late Republican era, Roman wine had been transformed from an indifferent local product for local consumption, to a major domestic and export commodity.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenstein, Nathan, "Aristocrats and Agriculture in the Middle Republic", ''The Journal of Roman Studies'', Vol. 98 (2008), pp. 2-16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicolet, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 9, pp. 612-615: up to this time, the Roman elite had favoured Greek imported wine over any of Rome's homegrown versions.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman writers have little to say about large-scale stock-breeding, but make passing references to its profitability. Drummond speculates that this might reflect elite preoccupations with historical grain famines, or long-standing competition between agriculturalists and pastoralists. While agriculture was a seasonal practise, pasturage was a year-round requirement. Some of Republican Rome's early agricultural legislation sought to balance the competing public grazing rights of small farmers, the farming elite, and [[Transhumance|transhumant]] pastoralists, who maintained an ancient right to herd, graze and water their animals between low-lying winter pastures and upland summer pastures. From the early second century, transhumance was practised on a vast scale, as an investment opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;Drummond, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7, part 2,  pp. 118-122.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gabba, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 8, pp. 237-239.&lt;/ref&gt; Though meat and hides were valuable by products of stock-raising, cattle were primarily reared to pull carts and ploughs, and sheep were bred for their wool, the mainstay of the Roman clothing industry. Horses, mules and donkeys were bred as civil and military transport. Pigs bred prolifically, and could be raised at little cost by any small farmer with rights to [[pannage]]. Their central dietary role is reflected by their use as sacrificial victims in domestic cults, funerals, and cults to agricultural deities.&lt;ref&gt;Drummond, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7, part 2, pp. 118-122.&lt;/ref&gt;

Republican Rome's religious practises harked back to [[Roman mythology|Rome's quasi-mythical history]].&lt;ref name="Rüpke, p. 4"&gt;Rüpke, ''Companion to Roman Religion'', p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beard, North pp. 30-35"&gt;Beard, North, Price, ''Religions of Rome'', Vol. I, pp. 30-35.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Romulus]], a son of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], founded Rome after [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] granted him [[Augury|favourable bird-signs]] regarding the site.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Schilling, "The Decline and Survival of Roman Religion", ''Roman and European Mythologies'' University of Chicago Press, 1992, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; [[Numa Pompilius]], second king of Rome, had established Rome's basic religious and political institutions after direct instructions from the gods, given through augury, dreams and [[oracle]]. Each king thereafter was credited with some form of divinely approved innovation, adaptation or reform.&lt;ref&gt;King Numa Pompilius was also said to have consorted with the nymph [[Egeria (mythology)|Egeria]]. The myths surrounding king [[Servius Tullius]] include his divine fathering by a [[Lares|Lar]] of the royal household, or by [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]], god of fire; and his love-affair with the goddess [[Fortuna]].&lt;/ref&gt; An Imperial-era source claims that the Republic's first consul, Brutus, effectively abolished human sacrifice to the goddess [[Mother of the Lares|Mania]], instituted by the last king, Tarquinius.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ambrosius Theodosius Macrobius|Macrobius]] describes the woolen figurines (''maniae'') hung at crossroad shrines during the popular [[Compitalia]] festival as substitutions for ancient [[human sacrifice]] once held at the same festival and suppressed by Rome's first consul, [[Lucius Junius Brutus|L. Junius Brutus]]. Whatever the truth regarding this sacrifice and its abolition, the Junii celebrated their ancestor cult during Larentalia rather than the usual [[Parentalia]] even in the 1st century BC; see Taylor, Lilly Ross, "The Mother of the Lares", in ''American Journal of Archaeology,'' Vol. 29, 3, (July - Sept. 1925), p. 302 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Romans acknowledged the existence of [[List of Roman deities|innumerable deities]] who controlled the natural world and human affairs. Every individual, occupation and location had a protective [[Tutelary deity#Ancient Rome|tutelary deity]], or sometimes several. Each was associated with a particular, highly prescriptive form of prayer and sacrifice. Piety (''pietas'') was the correct, dutiful and timely performance of such actions. The well-being of each Roman household was thought to depend on daily cult to its [[Lares]] and [[Penates]] (guardian deities, or spirits), ancestors, and the [[Genius (mythology)|divine generative essence]] embodied within its ''pater familias''. A family which neglected its religious responsibilities could not expect to prosper.&lt;ref&gt;Orr, D. G., Roman domestic religion: the evidence of the household shrines, ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'', II, 16, 2, Berlin, 1978, 1557‑91.&lt;/ref&gt;

The well-being of the Roman state depended on its state deities, whose opinions and will could be discerned by priests and magistrates, trained in augury, [[Haruspex|haruspicy]], oracles and the interpretation of [[Omen (ancient Rome)|omens]]. Impieties in state religion could produce expressions of divine wrath such as social unrest, wars, famines and epidemics, [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#vitium|vitiate]] the political process, render elections null and void, and lead to the abandonment of planned treaties, wars and any government business. Accidental errors could be remedied by repeating the rite correctly, or by an additional sacrifice; outright sacrilege threatened the bonds between the human and divine, and carried the death penalty. As divine retribution was invoked in the lawful swearing of oaths and vows, oath-breakers forfeited their right to divine protection, and might be killed with impunity.&lt;ref&gt;Halm, ''Companion to Roman Religion'', pp. 241, 242.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman religious authorities were unconcerned with personal beliefs or privately funded cults, unless they offended natural or divine laws, or undermined the ''mos maiorum'' (roughly, "the way of the ancestors"); the relationship between gods and mortals should be sober, contractual, and of mutual benefit. Undignified grovelling, excessive enthusiasm (''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#superstitio|superstitio]]'') and secretive practises were "weak minded" and morally suspect.&lt;ref&gt;Rüpke, ''Companion to Roman Religion'', p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  Magical practises were officially banned, as attempts to subvert the will of the gods for personal gain, but were probably common among all classes. Private cult organisations that seemed to threaten Rome's political and priestly hierarchy were investigated by the Senate, with advice from the priestly colleges. The Republic's most notable religious suppression was that of the [[Bacchanalia]], a widespread, unofficial, enthusiastic cult to the Greek wine-god [[Bacchus]]. The cult organisation was ferociously [[Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus|suppressed]], and its deity was absorbed within the official cult to Rome's own wine-god, [[Liber]].&lt;ref&gt;Erich S. Gruen, Erich S., "The Bacchanalia affair", in ''Studies in Greek Culture and Roman Policy'', University of California Press, 1996, p. 34 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The official recognition, adoption and supervision of foreign deities and practices, whether [[Etruscan religion|Etruscan]], [[Sabines|Sabine]], [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latin]] or [[Magna Graecia|colonial Greek]], had been an important unitary feature in Rome's territorial expansion and dominance since the days of the kings. For example, king [[Servius Tullius]] had established an Aventine temple to [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] as a Roman focus for the [[Latin League]].&lt;ref name="Rüpke, p. 4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Beard, North pp. 30-35"/&gt;

The gods were thought to communicate their wrath (''[[ira deorum]]'') through [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#prodigium|prodigies (unnatural or aberrant phenomena)]]. During the crisis of the [[Second Punic War]] an unprecedented number of reported prodigies were expiated, in more than twenty days of public ritual and sacrifices. In the same period, Rome recruited the [[Cybele|"Trojan" Magna Mater (Great Mother of the Gods)]] to the Roman cause, "Hellenised" the native Roman cult to [[Ceres (mythology)#Ceres and Proserpina|Ceres]]; and took control of the [[Bacchanalia]] festival in Rome and its allied territories. Following Rome's disastrous defeat at [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]], the State's most prominent [[Sibylline Books|written oracle]] recommended the living burial of [[Religion in ancient Rome#Sacrifice|human victims]] in the [[Forum Boarium]] to placate the gods.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberger, ''Companion to Roman Religion'', pp. 295-298; the discovery of a [[Intersex|hermaphroditic]] four-year-old child was expiated by the state [[haruspex]], who set the child to drown in the sea. Its survival for four years after its birth would have been regarded as extreme dereliction of religious duty.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Livy, xxvii. 37, cited by Halm, ''Companion to Roman Religion'', p. 244; see also Rosenberger, p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Livy]] describes this "bloodless" human sacrifice as an abhorrent but pious necessity; Rome's eventual victory confirmed the gods' approval.&lt;ref&gt;For Livy's use of prodigies and portents as markers of Roman impiety and military failure, see Feeney, ''Companion to Roman Religion'', pp. 138, 139. For prodigies in the context of political decision-making, see Rosenberger, pp. 295-298.&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the mid-Republican era, some leading Romans publicly displayed special, sometimes even intimate relationships with particular deities. For instance, [[Scipio Africanus]] claimed Jupiter as a personal mentor. Some gentes claimed a divine descent, often thanks to a [[false etymology]] of their name; the Caecilii Metelli pretended to descend from Vulcan through his son [[Caeculus]], the [[Mamilii]] from [[Circe]] through her granddaughter Mamilia, the [[Julia (gens)|Julii Caesares]] and the [[Aemilii]] from Venus through her grandsons [[Iulus]] and Aemylos. In the 1st century, [[Sulla]], [[Pompey]], and Caesar made competing claims for Venus' favour.&lt;ref&gt;Festus, "Caeculus", "Aemilia" and others.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Orlin, ''Companion to Roman Religion'', pp. 67-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Priesthoods===
With the abolition of monarchy, some of its sacral duties were shared by the consuls, while others passed to a Republican ''[[rex sacrorum]]'' (king of the sacred rites"), a patrician "king", elected for life, with great prestige but no executive or kingly powers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jörg Rüpke]], ''Religion of the Romans'' (Polity Press, 2007, originally published in German 2001), p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; Rome had no specifically priestly class or caste. As every famiy's  ''pater familias'' was responsible for his family's cult activities, he was effectively the senior priest of his own household. Likewise, most priests of public cult were expected to marry, produce children, and support their families.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Vestal Virgins]] were the major exception. The [[Galli]], mendicant eunuch priets of the [[Magna Mater]], were forbidden Roman citizenship.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early Republic the patricians, as "fathers" to the Roman people, claimed the right of seniority to lead and control the state's relationship with the divine. Patrician families, in particular the ''Cornelii'', ''Postumii'' and ''Valerii'', monopolised the leading state priesthoods: the ''[[flamines]]'' of [[Flamen Dialis|Jupiter]], [[Flamen Martialis|Mars]] and [[Flamen Quirinalis|Quirinus]], as well as the ''[[pontifices]]''. The patrician ''[[Flamen Dialis]]'' employed the "greater auspices" (''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#auspicia maiora|auspicia maiora]]'') to consult with [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] on significant matters of State.

Twelve "lesser flaminates" (''Flamines minores''), were open to plebeians, or reserved to them. They included a ''Flamen Cerealis'' in service of [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]], goddess of grain and growth, and protector of plebeian laws and tribunes.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, ''The beginnings of Rome'', p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt; The plebs had their own forms of augury, which they credited to [[Marsyas]], a [[satyr]] or [[Silenus|silen]] in the entourage of Liber, plebeian god of grapes, wine, freedom and male fertility.&lt;ref&gt;Barbette Stanley Spaeth, "The Goddess Ceres and the Death of Tiberius Gracchus", ''Historia: Zeitschrift für Alte Geschichte'', Vol. 39, No. 2 (1990), pp. 185-186.&lt;/ref&gt; The priesthoods of local urban and rustic [[Compitalia]] street-festivals, dedicated to the [[Lares]] of local communities, were open to freedmen and slaves, to whom "even the heavy-handed Cato recommended liberality during the festival"; so that the slaves, "being softened by this instance of humanity, which has something great and solemn about it, may make themselves more agreeable to their masters and be less sensible of the severity of their condition".&lt;ref&gt;Lott, John.

The ''[[Lex Ogulnia]]'' (300) gave patricians and plebeians more-or-less equal representation in the augural and pontifical colleges;&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, ''The beginnings of Rome'', p. 342&lt;/ref&gt; other important priesthoods, such as the [[Quindecimviri sacris faciundis|Quindecimviri]] ("The Fifteen"), and the  ''epulones''&lt;ref&gt;Established in 196 to take over the running of a growing number of [[ludi]] and festivals from the ''pontifices''&lt;/ref&gt; were opened to any member of the senatorial class.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Lipka, M., ''Roman Gods: a conceptual approach'',  Versnel, H., S., Frankfurter, D., Hahn, J., (Editors), ''Religions in the Graeco-Roman world'', BRILL, 2009, pp. 171-172&lt;/ref&gt; To restrain the accumulation and potential abuse of priestly powers, each ''gens'' was permitted one priesthood at any given time, and the religious activities of senators were monitored by the [[Roman censor|censors]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Magistrates who held an augurate could claim divine authority for their position and policies.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberger, ''Companion to Roman Religion'', p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Auctoritas'' (authority) is etymologically linked to ''augur'': See Cornell, ''The Beginnings of Rome'', p. 341&lt;/ref&gt; In the late Republic, augury came under the control of the ''pontifices'', whose powers were increasingly woven into the civil and military ''[[cursus honorum]]''. Eventually, the office of ''[[pontifex maximus]]'' became a ''de facto'' consular prerogative.&lt;ref&gt;Brent, A. ''The imperial cult and the development of church order: Concepts and images of authority in paganism and early Christianity before the Age of Cyprian'', BRILL, 1999, pp. 21-25, 19,20: citing Cicero, ''De Natura Deorum'', 2.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cults may have been exclusively female; for example, the rites of the Good Goddess (''[[Bona Dea]]''). Towards the end of the second Punic War, Rome rewarded priestesses of [[Demeter]] from ''Graeca Magna'' with Roman citizenship for training respectable, leading matrons as''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#sacerdos|sacerdotes]]'' of "Greek rites" to Ceres.&lt;ref&gt;Spaeth, Barbette Stanley, ''The Roman goddess Ceres'', University of Texas Press, 1996, pp. 4, 6 - 13. {{ISBN|0-292-77693-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every matron of a family (the wife of its [[paterfamilias|''pater familias'']] had a religious duty to maintain the household fire, which was considered an extension of [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta's]] sacred fire, tended in perpetuity by the chaste [[Vestal Virgins]]. The Vestals also made the sacrificial ''[[mola salsa]]'' employed in many State rituals, and represent an essential link between domestic and state religion. Rome's survival was thought to depend on their sacred status and ritual purity. Vestals found guilty of inchastity were "willingly" buried alive, to expiate their offence and avoid the imposition of blood-guilt on those who inflicted the punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Cunham, ''Cambridge Companion to the Roman Republic'', p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beard, Mary, "The Sexual Status of Vestal Virgins," ''The Journal of Roman Studies'', Vol. 70, (1980), pp.&amp;nbsp;12–27; and Parker, Holt N.

===Temples and festivals===
{{further|Roman temple|Roman festival|Roman calendar|Fasti}}
[[File:Temple of echo Baiae.JPG|thumb|Inside the "Temple of Mercury" or Temple of Echo at [[Baiae]], containing one of the [[List of Roman domes|largest domes]] in the world before the building of the [[Pantheon, Rome]] in the 2nd century AD]]

Rome's major public temples were contained within the city's sacred, augural boundary (''[[pomerium]]''), which had supposedly been marked out by Romulus, with Jupiter's approval. The [[Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus]] ("Jupiter, Best and Greatest") stood on the [[Capitoline Hill]].  Among the settled areas outside the ''pomerium'' was the nearby [[Aventine Hill]]. It was traditionally associated with Romulus' unfortunate twin, [[Remus]], and in later history with the Latins, and the Roman ''plebs''. The Aventine seems to have functioned as a place for the introduction of "foreign" deities.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, ''Beginnings of Rome'', p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt; In 392, [[Marcus Furius Camillus|Camillus]] established a temple there to [[Juno (mythology)#Epithets|Juno Regina]], Etruscan [[Veii]]'s protective goddess. Later introductions include [[Summanus]], c. 278, [[Vortumnus]]  c. 264, and at some time before the end of the 3rd century, [[Minerva]].&lt;ref&gt;Orlin, Eric M., Foreign Cults in Republican Rome: Rethinking the Pomerial Rule, ''Memoirs of the American Academy in Rome'', Vol. 47 (2002), pp. 4-5. For Camillus and Juno, see Stephen Benko, ''The virgin goddess: studies in the pagan and Christian roots of mariology,'' BRILL, 2004, p.27.&lt;/ref&gt; While Ceres' Aventine temple was most likely built at patrician expense, to mollify the ''plebs'', the patricians brought the [[Magna Mater]] ("Great mother of the Gods") to Rome as their own "Trojan" ancestral goddess, and installed her on the Palatine, along with her distinctively "un-Roman" [[Galli]] priesthood.&lt;ref&gt;Roller, Lynn Emrich (1999). ''In Search of God the Mother: The Cult of Anatolian Cybele'', Berkeley and Los Angeles, California: University of California Press, pp. 282 - 285. {{ISBN|0-520-21024-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Romulus was said to have pitched his augural tent atop the Palatine. Beneath its southern slopes ran the [[Via Sacra|sacred way]], next to the former palace of the kings ([[Regia]]), the [[House of the Vestals]] and [[Temple of Vesta]]. Close by were the [[Lupercal]] shrine and the cave where Romulus and Remus were said to have been suckled by the she-wolf.  On the flat area between the Aventine and Palatine was the [[Circus Maximus]], which hosted chariot races and religious games. Its several shrines and temples included those to Rome's indigenous sun-god, [[Sol (mythology)|Sol]], the moon-goddess [[Luna (goddess)|Luna]], the grain-storage god, [[Consus]], and the obscure goddess [[Murcia]]. A temple to [[Hercules]] stood in the [[Forum Boarium]], near the Circus starting gate. Every district (''[[Vicus]]'') of the city had a crossroads shrine to its own protective Lares.

Whereas Republican (and thereafter, Imperial) Romans marked the passage of years with the names of their ruling consuls, their [[Roman calendar|calendars]] marked the anniversaries of religious foundations to particular deities, the days when official business was permitted (''fas''), and those when it was not (''nefas''). The Romans observed an eight-day week; markets were held on the ninth day. Each month was presided over by a particular, usually major deity. The oldest calendars were lunar, structured around the most significant periods in the agricultural cycle, and the religious duties required to yield a good harvest.

===In the military===
[[File:Gaius Julius Caesar, denarius, 44 BC, RRC 480-3.jpg|thumb|Denarius of Caesar, minted just before his murder, in 44 BC. It was the first Roman coin bearing the portrait of a living person. The ''[[lituus]]'' and ''culullus'' depicted behind his head refer to his augurate and pontificate. The reverse with Venus alludes to his claimed descent from the goddess.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, ''Roman Republican Coinage'', pp. 487-495.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Before any campaign or battle, Roman commanders took [[auspices]], or [[Haruspex|haruspices]], to seek the gods' opinion regarding the likely outcome. Military success was achieved through a combination of personal and collective ''virtus'' (roughly, "manly virtue") and divine will. [[Roman triumph|Triumphal generals]] dressed as Jupiter Capitolinus, and laid their victor's laurels at his feet. Religious negligence, or lack of ''virtus'', provoked divine wrath and led to military disaster.&lt;ref&gt;Orlin, ''Companion to Roman Religion'', p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beard, North, Price, ''Religions of Rome'', Vol. I, pp. 44, 59, 60, 143.&lt;/ref&gt; Military oaths dedicated the oath-takers life to Rome's gods and people; defeated soldiers were expected to take their own lives, rather than survive as captives. Examples of ''[[devotio]]'', as performed by the [[Decia (gens)|Decii Mures]], in which soldiers offered and gave their lives to the ''[[Di inferi]]'' (gods of the underworld) in exchange for Roman victory were celebrated as the highest good.

Some of Republican Rome's leading deities were acquired through military actions. In the earliest years of the Republic, [[Marcus Furius Camillus|Camillus]] promised Veii's goddess [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] a temple in Rome as incentive for her desertion ''([[evocatio]])''. He conquered the city in her name, brought her cult statue to Rome "with miraculous ease" and dedicated a temple to her on the Aventine Hill.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7, part 2, p. 299, citing Livy xxi. 8-9 and xxii. 3-6. Livy describes this as ''[[wiktionary:evocatio|evocatio]]'' (a "calling forth") initiated by Roman soldiers who snatched the goddess's sacrificial portion during her Veiian rites; the Veiian priest had announced that whoever possessed the sacred entrails would win the coming battle.&lt;/ref&gt; The first known temple to [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] was built to fulfil a [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#votum|vow]] made by [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Gurges (consul 292 BC)|Q. Fabius Gurges]] during battle against the [[Samnite Wars#Third Samnite War (298 to 290 BC)|Samnites]].&lt;ref&gt;Eden, P.T., "Venus and the Cabbage" Hermes, 91, (1963) p. 456.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schilling, R. ''La Religion romaine de Venus'', BEFAR, Paris, 1954, p.87, suggests that Venus began as an abstraction of personal qualities, later assuming Aphrodite's attributes.&lt;/ref&gt; Following Rome's disastrous defeat by Carthage in the [[Battle of Lake Trasimene]] (217), Rome laid siege to [[Eryx (Sicily)|Eryx]], a Sicillian ally of Carthage. The city's patron deity, whom the Romans recognised as a warlike version of Venus, was [[Evocatio|"persuaded" to change her allegiance]] and was rewarded with a magnificent temple on the [[Capitoline Hill]], as one of Rome's twelve [[Dii consentes]]. ''Venus Victrix'' was thought to grant her favourites a relatively easy victory, worthy of an [[ovation]] and myrtle crown.&lt;ref&gt;See Mary Beard, ''The Roman Triumph'', The Belknap Press, 2007, pp. 62-63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brouwer, Henrik H. J., ''Bona Dea, The Sources and a Description of the Cult,'' Études préliminaires aux religions orientales dans l'Empire romain, 110, Brill, 1989: citing Pliny the Elder, ''Natural History'', Book 23, 152 - 158, and Book 15, 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cities, towns and villas==
===City of Rome===
[[File:Servian Wall.JPG|thumb|upright=1.15|The ruins of the [[Servian Wall]], built during the 4th century BC, one of the earliest [[ancient Roman defensive walls]].]]

Life in the Roman Republic revolved around the city of Rome, and its [[Seven hills of Rome|seven hills]]. The most important governing, administrative and religious institutions were concentrated at its heart, on and around the [[Capitoline Hill|Capitoline]] and [[Palatine Hill]]s. The city rapidly outgrew its original sacred boudary (''[[pomerium]]''), and its [[Servian Wall|first city walls]]. Further growth was constrained by an inadequate fresh-water supply. Rome's first [[Roman aqueduct|aqueduct]] (312) built during the Punic wars crisis, provided a plentiful, clean supply. The building of further aqueducts led to the city's expansion and the establishment of public baths (''[[thermae]]'') as a central feature of Roman culture.&lt;ref&gt;Gargarin, M. and Fantham, E. (editors). ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome, Volume 1''. p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the earliest likely development of Roman public bathing, see Fagan, Garrett T., ''Bathing in Public in the Roman World'', University of Michigan Press, 1999, pp. 42−44.&lt;/ref&gt; The city also had several [[Roman theatre (structure)|theatres]],&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Mark Wilson ''Principles of Roman Architecture.'' New Haven: Yale University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; [[gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasiums]], and many taverns and brothels. Living space was at a premium. Some ordinary citizens and freedmen of middling income might live in modest houses but most of the population lived in apartment blocks ([[Insula (building)|''insulae,'' literally "islands"]]), where the better-off might rent an entire ground floor, and the poorest a single, possibly windowless room at the top, with few or no amenities. Nobles and rich patrons lived in spacious, well-appointed town houses; they were expected to keep "open house" for their peers and clients. A semi-public ''[[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]]'' typically functioned as a meeting-space, and a vehicle for display of wealth, artistic taste, and religious piety. Noble ''atria'' were also display areas for ancestor-masks (''[[Roman funerals and burial#Funerary art|imagines]]'').&lt;ref&gt;"The architecture of the ancient Romans was, from first to last, an art of shaping space around ritual:" Lott, John. B., ''The Neighborhoods of Augustan Rome,'' Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2004, p. 1, citing Frank E. Brown, ''Roman Architecture'', (New York, 1961, p. 9. Some Roman ritual includes activities which might be called, in modern terms, religious; some is what might be understood in modern terms as secular &amp;ndash; the proper and habitual way of doing things. For Romans, both activities were matters of lawful custom (''[[mos maiorum]]'') rather than religious as opposed to secular.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Roman towns and cities had a [[Roman Forum|forum]] and temples, as did the city of Rome itself. [[Aqueduct (Roman)|Aqueducts]] brought water to urban centres.&lt;ref name="Kevin Greene,"&gt;[[Kevin Greene (archaeologist)|Kevin Greene]], "Technological Innovation and Economic Progress in the Ancient World: M.I. Finley Re-Considered", ''The Economic History Review'', New Series, Vol. 53, No. 1. (February, 2000), pp. 29–59 (39)&lt;/ref&gt; Landlords generally resided in cities and left their estates in the care of farm managers.

==Culture==
===Clothing===
{{Main|Clothing in ancient Rome}}
[[File:L'Arringatore.jpg|thumb|250px|''[[The Orator]]'', c. 100 BC, an [[Etruscan art|Etrusco]]-[[Roman sculpture|Roman]] statue of a Republican [[Roman senate|senator]], wearing ''[[toga praetexta]]'' and [[Calceus|senatorial shoes]]; compared to the voluminous, costly, impractical togas of the Imperial era, the Republican-era type is frugal and "skimpy" (''exigua'').&lt;ref&gt;Ceccarelli, L., in Bell, S., and Carpino, A., A, (Editors) ''A Companion to the Etruscans'' (Blackwell Companions to the Ancient World), Blackwell Publishing, 2016, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The basic Roman garment was the Greek-style [[tunic]], worn knee-length and short-sleeved (or sleeveless) for men and boys, and ankle-length and long-sleeved for women and girls. The [[toga]] was distinctively Roman. It was thought to have begun during the early [[Roman kingdom]], as a plain woolen "shepherd's wrap", worn by both sexes, all classes, and all occupations, including the military.&lt;ref&gt;According to Roman tradition, soldiers had once worn togas to war, hitching them up with what was known as a "Gabine cinch". See Stone, ''The World of Roman Costume'', p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; By the middle to late Republic, citizen women had abandoned it for the less bulky, Greek-style [[stola]], and the military used it only for off-duty ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;An [[equestrian statue]], described during the Imperial era by Pliny the Elder as "ancient",  showed the early, legendary Republican heroine [[Cloelia]] on horseback, wearing a toga: see Olson, ''Roman Dress and the Fabrics of Roman Culture'', p. 151 (note 18).&lt;/ref&gt; The toga became a mark of male citizenship, a statement of social degree.&lt;ref&gt;Vout, Caroline, "[[doi:10.1093/gr/43.2.204|The Myth of the Toga: Understanding the History of Roman Dress]]", ''Greece &amp; Rome'', 43, No. 2 (Oct., 1996), p. 215: Vout cites Servius, ''In Aenidem'', 1.281 and Nonius, 14.867L for the former wearing of togas by women other than prostitutes and adulteresses.&lt;/ref&gt; Convention also dictated the type, colour and style of ''[[Calceus|calcei]]'' (ankle-boots) appropriate to each level of male citizenship; red for senators, brown with crescent-shaped buckles for [[equites]], and plain tanned for ''plebs''.

The whitest, most voluminous togas were worn by the senatorial class. High ranking magistrates, priests and citizen's children were entitled to a purple-bordered ''[[toga praetexta]]''. [[Roman triumph|Triumphal generals]] wore an all-purple, gold-embroidered [[toga picta]], associated with the image of [[Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus|Jupiter]] and Rome's former [[King of Rome|kings]] - but only for a single day; Republican mores simultaneously fostered competitive display and [[Sumptuary law|attempted its containment]], to preserve at least a notional equality between peers, and reduce the potential threats of class envy.&lt;ref&gt;Flower, Harriet F., ''Ancestor Masks and Aristocratic Power in Roman Culture'', Oxford University Press, 1996, p. 118: "The best model for understanding Roman sumptuary legislation is that of aristocratic self-preservation within a highly competitive society which valued overt display of prestige above all else."&lt;/ref&gt; Togas, however, were impractical for physical activities other than sitting in the theatre, public oratory, and attending the ''[[Patronage in ancient Rome|salutiones]]'' ("greeting sessions") of rich patrons. Most Roman citizens, particularly the lower class of plebs, seem to have opted for more comfortable and practical garments, such as tunics and cloaks.

Luxurious and highly coloured clothing had always been available to those who could afford it, particularly women of the leisured classes. There is material evidence for cloth-of-gold ([[Lamé (fabric)|lamé]]) as early as the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;Sebesta, ''The World of Roman Costume'', pp. 62-68.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 3rd century, significant quantities of raw [[silk]] was being imported [[Han dynasty|from China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Dictionaries of Civilization: Rome| author=Gabucci, Ada| publisher=University of California Press| year=2005| p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Lex Oppia]]'' (215), which restricted personal expenditure on such luxuries as purple clothing, was repealed in 195, after a mass public protest by wealthy Roman matrons.&lt;ref&gt;Astin, Rawson, Morel, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 9, pp. 181-185, 439, 453, 495.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tyrian purple]], as a quasi-sacred colour, was officially reserved for the border of the ''toga praetexta'' and for the solid purple ''toga picta'';&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Mark, ''Colour and Meaning in Ancient Rome'', Cambridge Classical Studies, Cambridge University Press, 2011, pp. 189, 194-195&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edmondson, ''Roman Dress and the Fabrics of Roman Culture'', pp. 28-30; Keith, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; but towards the end of the Republic, the notorious [[Verres]] was wearing a purple ''[[pallium]]'' at all-night parties, not long before his trial, disgrace and exile for corruption.&lt;ref&gt;Sebesta, ''The World of Roman Costume'', pp. 54-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

For most Romans, even the simplest, cheapest linen or woolen clothing represented a major expense. Worn clothing was passed down the social scale until it fell to rags, and these in turn were used for patchwork.&lt;ref&gt;Vout, Caroline, "The Myth of the Toga: Understanding the History of Roman Dress", ''Greece &amp; Rome'', 43, No. 2 (Oct., 1996), pp. 211, 212.&lt;/ref&gt; Wool and linen were the mainstays of Roman clothing, idealised by Roman moralists as simple and frugal.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Edmondson, ''Roman Dress and the Fabrics of Roman Culture'', p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Landowners were advised that female slaves not otherwise occupied should be producing homespun woolen cloth, good enough for clothing the better class of slave or supervisor. [[Cato the Elder]] recommended that slaves be given a new cloak and tunic every two years; coarse rustic homespun would likely be "too good" for the lowest class of slave, but not good enough for their masters.&lt;ref&gt;Sebesta, ''The World of Roman Costume'', p. 70, citing Columella, 12, praef. 9-10, 12.3.6.&lt;/ref&gt; For most women, the carding, combing, spinning and weaving of wool were part of daily housekeeping, either for family use or for sale. In traditionalist, wealthy households, the family's wool-baskets, spindles and looms were positioned in the semi-public reception area  (''[[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]]''), where the [[mater familias]] and her [[Pater familias#The Roman familia|familia]] could thus demonstrate their industry and frugality; a largely symbolic and moral activity for those of their class, rather than practical necessity.&lt;ref&gt;In reality, she was the female equivalent of the romanticised citizen-farmer: see Flower, ''Cambridge Companion to the Roman Republic'', pp. 153, 195-197.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Republic wore on, its trade, territories and wealth increased. Roman conservatives deplored the apparent erosion of traditional, class-based dress distinctions, and an increasing Roman appetite for luxurious fabrics and exotic "foreign" styles among all classes, including their own. Towards the end of the Republic, the ultra-traditionalist [[Cato the younger]] publicly protested the self-indulgent greed and ambition of his peers, and the loss of Republican [[Virtus|"manly virtues"]], by wearing a "skimpy" dark woolen toga, without tunic or footwear.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Appian]]'s history of Rome finds its strife-torn Late Republic tottering at the edge of chaos; most seem to dress as they like, not as they ought: "For now the Roman people are much mixed with foreigners, there is equal citizenship for freedmen, and slaves dress like their masters. With the exception of the Senators, free citizens and slaves wear the same costume." See Rothfus, MA, "The Gens Togata: Changing Styles and Changing Identities", ''American Journal of Philology'', 2010, p. 1, citing Appian, 2.17.120&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food and dining===
{{main|Ancient Roman cuisine}}
[[File:Scène de banquet, fresque, Herculanum.jpg|thumb|Banquet scene, [[fresco]], [[Herculaneum]], Italy, c. 50 BC]]
Modern study of the dietary habits during the Republic are hampered by various factors.  Few writings have survived, and because different components of their diet are more or less likely to be preserved, the archaeological record cannot be relied on.&lt;ref&gt;Witcher, R.E. (2016)  ''Agricultural production in Roman Italy'' [http://dro.dur.ac.uk/20474/1/20474.pdf (see page 8)] from ''A companion to Roman Italy''. (Wiley-Blackwell). Blackwell companions to the ancient world. p. 459-482.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cato the elder]]'s ''[[De Agri Cultura]]'' includes several recipes and his suggested "Rations for the hands".  The list of ingredients includes cheese, honey, poppy seeds, coriander, fennel, cumin, egg, olives, bay leaves, laurel twig, and anise.  He gives instructions for kneading bread, making porridge, [[Placenta cake]], brine, various wines, preserving lentils, planting asparagus, curing ham, and fattening geese and squab.&lt;ref&gt;Cato, ''De Agri Cultura'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cato/De_Agricultura/E*.html ch. 74-90], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cato/De_Agricultura/G*.html 104-125], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cato/De_Agricultura/K*.html 156-157], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cato/De_Agricultura/L*.html 158-162].&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman poet [[Horace]] mentions another Roman favorite, the olive, in reference to his own diet, which he describes as very simple: "As for me, olives, [[endive]]s, and smooth [[Althaea (plant)|mallows]] provide sustenance."&lt;ref&gt;"Me pascunt olivae, me cichorea levesque malvae." Horace, ''Odes 1.31.15'', ca 30 BC&lt;/ref&gt; Meat, fish and produce were a part of the Roman diet at all levels of society.&lt;ref&gt;Kron, Geoffrey (2012), Scheidel, W. (ed.), ''Food Production'' [http://web.stanford.edu/~scheidel/CCRE%20Chapter%208%20Supplement.pdf (see page 8, fn 72)] from ''The Cambridge Companion to the Roman Economy'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press: 156–174&lt;/ref&gt;

Romans valued fresh fruit, and had a diverse variety available to them.&lt;ref&gt;Kron, Food Production [http://web.stanford.edu/~scheidel/CCRE%20Chapter%208%20Supplement.pdf (see page 16)]&lt;/ref&gt; Wine was considered the basic drink,&lt;ref name="Phillips pg 46-56"&gt;Phillips pg 46–56&lt;/ref&gt; consumed at all meals and occasions by all classes and was quite inexpensive. Cato once advised cutting his rations in half to conserve wine for the workforce.&lt;ref name="Phillips pg 35-45"&gt;Phillips pg 35–45&lt;/ref&gt; Many types of drinks involving grapes and honey were consumed as well. Drinking on an empty stomach was regarded as boorish and a sure sign for alcoholism, the debilitating physical and psychological effects of which were known to the Romans. Accusations of alcoholism were used to discredit political rivals. Prominent Roman alcoholics included [[Mark Antony|Marcus Antonius]],&lt;ref name="Phillips pg 57-63"&gt;Phillipa pg 57–63&lt;/ref&gt; and Cicero's own son Marcus ([[Cicero Minor]]). Even [[Cato the Younger]] was known to be a heavy drinker.&lt;ref&gt;"Af first, he would drink once after supper and then leave the table; but as time went on he would allow himself to drink very generously, so that he often tarried at his wine till early morning."

Rome's original native language was [[early Latin]], the language of the [[Italic peoples|Italic]] [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latins]].  Most surviving [[Latin literature]] is written in [[Classical Latin]], a highly stylised and polished [[literary language]] which developed from early and vernacular spoken Latin, from the 1st century. Most Latin speakers used [[Vulgar Latin]], which significantly differed from Classical Latin in grammar, vocabulary, and eventually pronunciation.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Following various military conquests in the [[Greek East]], Romans adapted a number of Greek educational precepts to their own fledgling system.&lt;ref name="Legacy"&gt;Nanette R. Pacal, "The Legacy of Roman Education (in the Forum)", in ''The Classical Journal'', Vol. 79, No. 4. (April – May 1984)&lt;/ref&gt; Strenuous,  disciplined physical training helped prepare boys of citizen class for their eventual citizenship and a military career. Girls generally received instruction&lt;ref name="Ox"&gt;Oxford Classical Dictionary, Edited by Simon Hornblower and Antony Spawforth, Third Edition. Oxford; New York: Oxford University Press, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; from their mothers in the art of spinning, weaving, and sewing.
Schooling in a more formal sense was begun around 200. Education began at the age of around six, and in the next six to seven years, boys and girls were expected to learn the basics of reading, writing and counting. By the age of twelve, they would be learning Latin, Greek, grammar and literature, followed by training for public speaking. Effective [[Rhetoric|oratory]] and good Latin were highly valued among the elite, and were essential to a career in law or politics.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Farrell, ''Latin Language and Latin Culture'' (Cambridge University Press, 2001), pp. 74–75; Richard A. Bauman, ''Women and Politics in Ancient Rome'' (Routledge, 1992, 1994), pp. 51–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arts===
{{Main|Latin literature|Roman art|Music of ancient Rome|Roman architecture}}

In the 3rd century, Greek art taken as the spoils of war became popular, and many Roman homes were decorated with landscapes by Greek artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Toynbee |first=J. M. C. |date=December 1971 |title=Roman Art |journal=The Classical Review |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=439–442 |doi=10.1017/S0009840X00221331 |jstor=708631}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, Roman architecture was modified as their urban requirements changed, and the civil engineering and building construction technology became developed and refined. &lt;!--The [[Roman concrete]] has remained a riddle, and even after more than 2,000 years some Roman structures still stand magnificently.&lt;ref&gt;W. L. MacDonald, The Architecture of the Roman Empire, rev. ed. Yale University Press, New Haven, 1982, fig. 131B; Lechtman and Hobbs "Roman Concrete and the Roman Architectural Revolution"&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;The architectural style of the capital city was emulated by other urban centers under Roman control and influence. {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Literature===
Early Roman literature was influenced heavily by Greek authors. From the mid-Republic, Roman authors followed Greek models, to produce free-verse and verse-form plays and other in Latin; for example, [[Livius Andronicus]] wrote tragedies and comedies. The earliest Latin works to have survived intact are the comedies of [[Plautus]], written during the mid-Republic. Works of well-known, popular playwrights were sometimes commissioned for performance at religious festivals; many of these were [[Satyr plays]], based on Greek models and Greek myths. [[Lucretius]], in his ''[[On the Nature of Things]]'' explicated the tenets of [[Epicurean]] philosophy. Towards the end of the Republic, [[Virgil]]'s epic poem, the ''[[Aeneid]]'', built on Homer's ancient Greek epic, the ''[[Iliad]]'', to make the [[Troy|Trojan]] prince Aeneas an ancestor of the Roman people.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

===Sports and entertainment===

The city of Rome had a place called the [[Campus Martius]] ("Field of Mars"), which was a sort of drill ground for Roman soldiers. Later, the Campus became Rome's track and field playground. In the campus, the youth assembled to play and exercise, which included jumping, wrestling, boxing and racing. {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} Equestrian sports, throwing, and swimming were also preferred physical activities. {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} In the countryside, pastimes included fishing and hunting. {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} Board games played in Rome included [[dice]] (Tesserae or [[Venus Throw|Tali]]), Roman Chess ([[Ludus latrunculorum|Latrunculi]]), Roman [[Draughts|Checkers]] (Calculi), [[Tic-tac-toe]] (Terni Lapilli), and [[Ludus duodecim scriptorum]] and Tabula, predecessors of backgammon.&lt;ref name="austin-roman1"&gt;Austin, Roland G. "Roman Board Games. I", ''Greece &amp; Rome'' 4:10, October 1934. pp. 24–34.&lt;/ref&gt; Other activities included chariot races, and musical and theatrical performances. {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The '''SCCA Formula Super Vee''' was one of the longest running [[Formula Super Vee]] championships in the world. Twenty racing season were contested. Most of the races were sanctioned by the [[Sports Car Club of America]] in some occasions the races were sanctioned by the [[International Motor Sports Association]].

==History==
In 1969 Josef Hoppen, head of the motorsport department of [[Volkswagen of America]], approached the [[Sports Car Club of America]]. The Formula Super Vee was announced as an SCCA national class in November 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Super Vee|journal=Vee Line|date=November 1969|issue=62|pages=1, 4|url=http://www.formulavee.us/vee_lines/VeeLine%2062%20Nov%2069.pdf|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Formula Super Vee History|url=http://home.comcast.net/~yspect8/hist_fsv_reg/history.htm|website=Historic  Formula Super Vee  Register|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The class was created as a substitute for the overpopulated [[Formula Vee]] class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=1600 for 1970|journal=Vee Lines|date=October 1969|issue=61|pages=1, 4|url=http://www.formulavee.us/vee_lines/VeeLine%2061%20Oct%2069.pdf|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Beach Racing Cars]] manufactured the first Super Vee car, a single seater using threaded tires and no aerodynamic aides. Settled Formula Vee constructors [[Zink Cars]], Autodynamics and [[Zeitler Racing Design]] soon followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Super Vee|journal=Vee Lines|date=February 1970|issue=64|pages=4|url=http://www.formulavee.us/vee_lines/VeeLine%2064b%20Feb%2070.pdf|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beach's first Formula Super Vee chassis was bought by Formula Super Vee Europe to promote the racing class in Europe.

Thirteen drivers competed in the first edition of the Formula Super Vee [[SCCA National Championship Runoffs]] at [[Road Atlanta]]. Driver/constructor [[John Zeitler]] qualified on pole but dropped to fifth position. [[Tom Davey (racing driver)|Tom Davey]] won the prestigious race also racing a [[Zeitler Racing Design|Zeitler]] chassis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SCCA Runoffs Driver Histories|url=http://scca.cdn.racersites.com/prod/assets/12-runoffs-drivers-all.pdf|website=SCCA|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the combined Formula Super Vee/[[Formula Ford]] race, Super Vee's finished in the first three places. [[Skip Barber]] was the first Formula Ford driver placing fourth overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Super Vee at Atlanta|journal=Vee Lines|date=December 1970|issue=75|pages=4|url=http://www.formulavee.us/vee_lines/VeeLine%2075%20Dec%2070.pdf|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first national series was held in 1971. [[Bill Scott (racing driver)|Bill Scott]] won the inaugural race at [[Daytona International Raceway]]. Scott went on to win races at [[Road America]], [[Lime Rock Park]] and [[Laguna Seca Raceway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SCCA Formula Super Vee 1971|url=http://www.oldracingcars.com/fsv/us/FSV1971.jpg|website=Old Racing Cars|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1972 season entries improved and slick tires were introduced to the series. Scott became the first double champion of the series despite only winning two races.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SCCA Formula Super Vee 1972|url=http://www.oldracingcars.com/fsv/us/FSV1972.jpg|website=Old Racing Cars|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For 1973 international drivers stepped in with Swede [[Bertil Roos]] winning three out of the first four races. A late charge from [[Elliott Forbes-Robinson]] could not prevent Roos winning the championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SCCA Formula Super Vee 1973|url=http://www.oldracingcars.com/fsv/us/FSV1973.jpg|website=Old Racing Cars|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1974 a new Formula Super Vee era began. The series featured fourteen races, two of them outside the United States. Races abroad were run at [[Mosport Park]], Canada and [[Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez]], Mexico. Series organizer, Josef Hopen, was not loyal to any specific sanctioning body. Half of the races, including the races abroad, were sanctioned by the [[International Motor Sports Association]]. . The co-sanctioning continued for 1975 but ended before the 1976 season. Political disagreement resulted in Hoppen pulling the Formula Super Vee Robert Bosch championship out of IMSA. As a response IMSA created the [[Formula Atlantic]] class and [[United States Automobile Club|USAC]] created the [[Indy Lights|Mini-Indy Series]] Formula Super Vee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SERIES 2 - 1974 - 1976|url=http://www.formulasupervee.com/series-2.html|website=Formula Super Vee|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next era for Formula Super Vee started in 1978. The class introduced a new, water cooled, [[Volkswagen Rabbit]] engine replacing the old air cooled one. The SCCA club racing scene remained using the old engine. The SCCA dropped the class from its regional and national series, the pro series remained. [[Bill Alsup]] won the first season of the new era Formula Super Vee championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SCCA Formula Super Vee 1978|url=http://www.oldracingcars.com/fsv/us/FSV1978.jpg|website=Old Racing Cars|accessdate=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ralt]] dominated almost every season fielding the most cars out of any contstructor. Only the 1983 and 1986 championships were won by other manufacturers.

'''''Shadowtime''''' is the first [[opera]] by [[Brian Ferneyhough]], written to an English [[libretto]] by [[Charles Bernstein]]. It was written from 1999 to 2004 and was premiered on 25 May 2004 at the [[Prinzregententheater]] in [[Munich]]. The City of Munich commissioned the composition and libretto in 1999 for the [[Munich Biennale]]. It is in seven scenes {{harv|Bernstein|2008}}:
# ''New Angels/Transient Failure''
# ''{{lang|fr|Les Froissements d'ailes de Gabriel}}''
# Doctrine of Similarity
# ''{{Lang|la|Opus contra naturam}}: A Shadow Play for Speaking Pianist''
# ''Pools of Darkness''
# ''Seven Tableaux Vivants Representing the Angel of History as Melancholia''
# ''Stelae for Failed Time''

The composer regards ''{{Lang|la|Opus contra naturam}}'', a scene set to the composer's own text and played by a [[Liberace]]-like figure, as the centre-piece of the opera {{harv|Whittall|2003|loc=27}}.

==Synopsis==
The opera begins with the suicide/death of philosopher [[Walter Benjamin]] and goes on to deal with various aspects of his writings and philosophy from the point of view of his descent into the underworld {{harv|Bernstein|2008}}.

[[File:Strelnikoff-Bitchcraft.jpg|thumb|right|''Bitchcraft'' album cover]]
The '''Strelnikoff Mary of Help of Brezje controversy''' or the '''Strelnikoff Affair''' ({{lang-sl|Afera Strelnikoff}})&lt;ref name="Delo.si" /&gt; began after a depiction of [[Mary of Help of Brezje]] holding a [[rat]] instead of [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]] was published by the [[Slovenia]]n [[music group]] [[Strelnikoff]] on the cover of their 1998 [[studio album]] ''Bitchcraft.'' The album was made in protest of the official views of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in Slovenia and the statements of some of its highest representatives on the subject of [[abortion]].&lt;ref name="Delo.si"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.delo.si/kultura/dediscina/kako-hitro-so-uzaljena-verska-custva.html |title=Kako hitro so prizadeta verska čustva |language=Slovenian |trans-title=How Quickly Religious Sentiments Get Hurt |newspaper=Delo.si |date=18 May 2012 |first=Tanja |last=Cirman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first to condemn this depiction was [[Franc Rode]], who was the [[Bishop of Ljubljana]] at the time. This was followed by general public outcry and expressions of the inappropriateness of the misuse of one of the most known symbols of [[Roman Catholicism in Slovenia|Slovenian Catholicism]]. The [[State Attorney's Office (Slovenia)|State Attorney's Office]] received 3,867 public protests and 1,208 requests for [[indictment]]. These were united in one that was at first rebuffed before the [[Celje District Court]]. However, the state prosecutor Elizabeta Gyorkos filled a complaint.&lt;ref name=komarji&gt;{{sl icon}} [http://www.mladina.si/tednik/200329/clanek/komarji/ Mladina.si - provokatorji množic].

In accordance with the [[Constitution of Slovenia]] and the [[Slovenian law]], the court concluded that the authors were "tasteless in their artistic project, however they did not surpass the boundary of allowed at all."&lt;ref&gt;{{sl icon}} [http://www.mladina.si/tednik/200339/clanek/kul--glasba_in_cerkev-sebastijan_ozmec/ Mladina: Blasfemija po slovensko].

'''''Super Star''''' is a 2002 [[Kannada cinema|Kannada film]] written by [[Upendra (actor)|Upendra]] and directed by [[Nagathihalli Chandrashekhar]], starring [[Upendra (actor)|Upendra]] and [[Keerthi Reddy]]. The story line was loosely based on the [[Nepalese royal massacre]] involving [[Dipendra of Nepal]], the tragedy that struck the family of the Nepal king.

It was dubbed into [[Telugu language|Telugu]] as ''Stupid'', which was surprisingly a lot more successful than the Kannada version.&lt;ref name="meetelugu1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meetelugu.com/movies/movies/card/Stupid%20Movie%20DVD%20Online.html |title=Stupid Movie DVD Online &amp;#124; Telugu Movies &amp;#124; Online Movies |publisher=MeeTelugu.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
The reaction from the critics turned out to be mostly negative upon the film's release. While the performances of the lead artistes, unique story line of the film, soundtrack, background music and other technical aspects of the film were praised, the screenplay of the film was the most criticized by the critics as well as the audiences.

==Box office==
===Karnataka===
''Superstar'' had an extremely strong opening at the box office across [[Karnataka]] similar to the earlier record breaking openers of [[Upendra (actor)|Upendra]] and set the box office on fire during its opening weekend. The film continued to storm the box office during its initial weeks, but failed to live up to the expectations and most of the fans were disappointed by the movie. ''Superstar'' ended up becoming a below average grosser in [[Karnataka]] by running only for 6 weeks in its main centre in [[Bangalore]]. The film was sold to distributors at a very high distribution price and got an extraordinary opening in its initial weeks, thus returning investment for the producer. Compared to Upendra's earlier blockbuster movies like ''[[A (1998 Kannada film)|A]]'', ''[[Upendra (film)|Upendra]]'', ''[[Preethse]]'', ''[[H2O (2002 Indian film)|H2O]]'', this film was considered as average hit as it returned investment for the producer.

===Andhra Pradesh===
The [[Telugu language|Telugu]] version of ''Superstar'' which was released in [[Andhra Pradesh]] in 2003 (a year after its original [[Kannada]] release) was titled as '''''Stupid - O Pichi Vadi Prema Katha''''' and had a fantastic opening across [[Andhra Pradesh]], owing mainly to [[Upendra (actor)|Upendra]]'s loyal Telugu fan following which he had gained due to the large success of the [[Telugu language|Telugu]] versions of his earlier blockbuster movies like ''[[A (1998 Kannada film)|A]]'' and ''[[Upendra (film)]]'' which not only starred him but were also directed by him, and a few straight Telugu movies like ''[[Raa (film)|Raa]]'' and ''[[Kanyadanam (1998 film)|Kanyadanam]]'' which were box office hits. Although ''Superstar'' was just an average grosser in [[Karnataka]], ''Stupid'' surprisingly turned out to be a hit in [[Andhra Pradesh]] by completing 100 days of run and its distributors in Andhra Pradesh earned fair profits from the movie.

"'''Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus'''" is the [[South Park (season 2)|second season]] premiere of the American [[animated television series]] ''[[South Park]]''. The 14th episode of the series overall, it originally aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on April 1, 1998. The episode follows the two [[List of recurring South Park characters#Terrance and Phillip|title characters]], a duo of Canadians who attempt to save their country from the dictator [[Saddam Hussein]] while performing repetitive [[toilet humour]]. Unbeknown to them, the plan was partially set up by their rival, [[List of recurring South Park characters#Scott the Dick|Scott]], a critic who is often displeased by their random jokes of [[flatulence]]. The script was written by series co-creators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]], along with writer Trisha Nixon.

The episode was an [[April Fools' Day]] prank on ''South Park'' fans who were waiting to learn the identity of [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]'s father after the cliffhanger ending of the [[South Park (season 1)|first season]] finale "[[Cartman's Mom Is a Dirty Slut]]". The prank angered viewers resulting in 2,000 e-mail complaints to Comedy Central within a week of the original broadcast. The broadcast date of the subsequent episode, "[[Cartman's Mom Is Still a Dirty Slut]]", was moved up in response to the complaints. "Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus" received generally mixed reviews, with some commentators criticizing Parker and Stone for "duping" their viewers, and others praising them for taking the risk. The creators cited this episode as their favorite and response to it has become warmer since.

==Plot==
The episode begins with an announcement that viewers have waited for weeks for the answer to the mystery "[[Cartman's Mom Is a Dirty Slut|Who Is Cartman's Father]]" but then points out that the answer will not be revealed in this episode; instead there is a presentation of a stand-alone cartoon titled ''Not Without My Anus'' starring [[List of recurring South Park characters|Terrance and Phillip]]. A caption wishes the viewers a Happy [[April Fools' Day]]. The cartoon itself opens in a courtroom in [[Canada]] with Terrance on trial for the murder of a local doctor; Phillip is his lawyer while Terrance and Phillip's sworn nemesis Scott, who has had a long hatred of the duo's [[toilet humor]], is acting as the prosecutor. Scott uses a group of seemingly airtight exhibits to prove Terrance's guilt, while Terrance's defense consists of nothing but a long string of fart jokes. Ultimately, the jury returns a verdict of not guilty. Angered, Scott promises vengeance. He is ultimately approached by [[Iraq]]i dictator [[Saddam Hussein]], proposing a deal: Saddam would assist in getting Terrance and Phillip out of Canada, in exchange for Scott assisting Saddam and his Iraqi associates into Canada. Scott is apprehensive about trusting Saddam, but agrees to the deal. The pair then conspires to kidnap Sally, daughter of Terrance and [[Celine Dion]], and hold her hostage, as bait to lure Terrance and Phillip to [[Tehran]]; Saddam's soldiers would then murder Terrance and Phillip on arrival.

Terrance and Phillip become aware of the kidnapping when they receive a letter, but they immediately locate Sally upon arrival in Tehran. The duo return Sally to her home, where Saddam has now taken control. Celine, Terrance's now ex-wife, is dating, and has become pregnant by a friend of the duo named Ugly Bob. While the couple discuss their relationship, Saddam interrupts and takes them hostage, with Celine having planned to sing at a [[Canadian football]] game. Scott has also become worried about the presence of the Iraqi soldiers in Canada, but becomes infuriated when he finds that Terrance and Phillip have returned to Canada safely. He confronts Saddam about the double-cross, but Saddam's armed guards scare him into backing away. It is revealed that Saddam is trying to take over Canada as the first step in a plan for world domination. Terrance and Phillip arrive at the game. Instead of following a plan set up by Scott to commit suicide by using a bomb, they come up with a new plan and put on gas masks. With brute force, everyone farts a huge gas cloud which kills Saddam and his soldiers. Scott arrives and is annoyed to find that Terrance and Phillip are still alive. Terrance, Phillip, Celine and everyone else (excluding Scott) celebrate their freedom with a rendition of "[[O Canada]]". During the credits, an announcement is shown stating that the solution to who Cartman's father is will be answered in a few weeks.

"Terrance and Philip in Not Without My Anus" was written by Trisha Nixon and ''South Park'' co-creators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]], and directed by Parker. It was the [[List of South Park episodes#Season 2: 1998.E2.80.931999|second season]] premiere and first episode centered completely around Terrance and Phillip, fictional cartoon characters within the series.&lt;ref name="NP0209"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Bayer |first=Jakob Von |title= Canada, as seen on TV: With The Simpsons coming to Toronto, we revisit some of our other starring roles |publisher=[[National Post]] |date=2002-02-09 |page=SP4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SMH0831"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Casimir |first=Jon |publisher=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=1998-08-31 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode first aired on April 1, 1998 as an [[April Fools' Day]] prank by Parker and Stone on ''South Park'' fans who were anxiously waiting to learn the identity of [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]'s father after the [[cliffhanger]] ending of "[[Cartman's Mom Is a Dirty Slut]]", the [[South Park (season 1)|first season]] finale. Instead, Parker and Stone presented an episode entirely focused on a Terrance and Phillip cartoon with nothing in the story about Cartman's father.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Idato |first=Michael |publisher=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=2002-08-19 |page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upset fans wrote more than 2,000 angry e-mail complaints to [[Comedy Central]] within a week of the episode's original broadcast,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Feran |first=Tom |title="Tom Jones" big, bawdy, well done |date=1998-04-04 |work=[[The Plain Dealer]] |location=[[Cleveland, Ohio]] |page=1F}}&lt;/ref&gt; and media outlets said some fans harbored a grudge against the show more than five years after the episode was broadcast.&lt;ref name="WSJ0704"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Clodfelter |first=Tim |title=Lots of fun some Comedy Central shows make it to DVD |work=[[Winston-Salem Journal]] |date=2003-07-04 |page=E4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stone said to ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' in response to the fan backlash, "If you get that pissed off because you don't know who a little construction paper kid's father is, then there's really something wrong with you."&lt;ref name="TS1226"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Bickley |first=Claire |title=The television year in months; hello to CablePulse24, Goodbye to Seinfeld and have a good thought for Michael J.

Several reviewers noted a significant amount of crude and vulgar humor in "Terrance and Philip in Not Without My Anus", even by ''South Park'' standards; ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' noted the episode contained 29 separate fart jokes in the span of 22 minutes.&lt;ref name="SMH0831" /&gt; [[Global Television Network]] in Canada reported no complaints about the episode in the weeks after its release.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Bickley |first=Claire |title=Jerry strikes out pitch to book Skydome for Seinfeld bash nixed |work=[[Toronto Sun]] |date=1998-04-21 |page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Reviewers were mixed on Parker and Stone's elaborate April Fools' Day prank. Diane Werts of ''[[Newsday]]'' said of the episode, "Fans rioted. Some jumped ship and never came back. The lesson: Pay off our expectations, or you'll be sorry."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Werts |first=Diane |title=Do viewers need closure after canceled show's cliffhanger? |work=[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]] |date=2000-07-13 |location=[[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]] |page=3E}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jim Minge of the ''[[Omaha World-Herald]]'' said ''South Park'' fans were "duped" by the episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Minge |first=Jim |title=One rumor is for real: Foo Fighters will perform at Westfair |date=1998-04-09 |work=[[Omaha World-Herald]] |page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philip Martin of the ''[[Arkansas Democrat-Gazette]]'', who said in May 1998 the ''South Park'' phenomenon was "dead", described the April Fools' prank as "lamentable" and part of the reason for the show's apparent decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Martin |first=Philip |title=On the American trash heap; Like South Park, pop culture wasn't built to last |work=[[Arkansas Democrat-Gazette]] |date=1998-05-10 |page=E1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, however, praised Parker and Stone for making the move at the risk of upsetting fans. Tim Clodfelter of the ''[[Winston-Salem Journal]]'' said, "It was a funny, clever move [that] quickly separated the fans who truly "got" [Parker and Stone's] humor from those who were just watching for the dirty jokes."&lt;ref name="WSJ0704" /&gt; Jon Casimir of ''The Sydney Morning Herald'' said, "It is gratifying, in an entertainment world dominated by market research and common denominators, to see a program that obviously doesn't care if you like it or not." However, he said the characterization of Terrance and Phillip was too thin to be particularly funny, and added that the novelty of the prank is lost in later years.&lt;ref name="SMH0831" /&gt;

Jakob Von Bayer said the episode continued a long history of ''South Park'' Canada-bashing: "South Park has gotten a lot of comic mileage out of Canada over the years. [...] This episode portrays a country full of [[Bob and Doug McKenzie]]s; [[Toronto]] is but a highway town en route to [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]."&lt;ref name="NP0209" /&gt; "Terrance and Philip in Not Without My Anus" was among the episodes featured in a 2006 list by the ''[[Winnipeg Free Press]]'' of the ten most memorable ''South Park'' episodes.&lt;ref name="WFP1119"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Politically incorrect comedy, heeeeerrre!|work=[[Winnipeg Free Press]]|location=[[Canada]]|date=2006-11-19|page=D5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Toronto Sun]]'' listed the episode as one of the most memorable television moments of 1998, and the single most memorable moment from the month of April.&lt;ref name="TS1226" /&gt; The prank played by the airing of this episode was revisited a number of times in subsequent episodes. The episode "[[Cartoon Wars Part II]]" revisits it by appearing to begin with a similar spoof, though the episode then cuts to the actual plot. The [[List of South Park episodes#Season 5: 2001|fifth season]] episode, "[[Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow]]", also references the controversy over the airing of this episode,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Drawn to Television Prime-time Animation from the Flintstones |last= Booker |first=M.

[[File:Bragolin Crying Boy.JPG|thumb|upright=1.1|The artist's signature ''G Bragolin'' is present in the top-right corner]]
'''''The Crying Boy''''' is a [[mass production|mass-produced]] print of a painting by [[Italy|Italian]] painter [[Giovanni Bragolin]].&lt;ref name="Polidoro2012"&gt;Polidoro, Massimo (November/December 2012), "Curse That Painting!", ''Skeptical Inquirer'' '''36''' (6): 17–19&lt;/ref&gt; It was widely distributed from the 1950s onwards.

There are numerous alternative versions, all portraits of tearful young boys or girls.&lt;ref name="Polidoro2012" /&gt; In addition to being widely known, certain [[urban legend|urban legends]] attribute a "curse" to the painting.

==Curse==
On 5 September 1985, the British [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] newspaper ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' reported that an Essex [[firefighter]] claimed that undamaged copies of the painting were frequently found amidst the ruins of burned houses.&lt;ref name="Polidoro2012" /&gt; By the end of November, belief in the painting's curse was widespread enough that ''The Sun'' was organising mass [[bonfire]]s of the paintings, sent in by readers.&lt;ref name="sun-2010"&gt;Steve Punt, "Solved: Curse of the Crying Boy; Comic’s Obsession with Painting", The Sun, 9 October 2010, p.8.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Steve Punt]], a British writer and comedian, investigated the curse of the crying boy in a [[BBC Radio 4]] production called ''[[Punt PI]]''. Although the format of the programmes are comic in nature, Punt researched the history of the Crying Boy painting.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Punt PI]],''  [http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00v697r Crying Boy episode] (programme broadcast Sat 9 Oct 2010, BBC Radio 4)&lt;/ref&gt; The conclusion reached by the programme, following testing at the [[Building Research Establishment]], is that the prints were treated with a [[varnish]] containing [[fire retardant]], and that the string holding the painting to the wall would be the first to deteriorate, resulting in the painting landing face down on the floor and thus being protected, although no explanation was given as to why no other paintings were turning up unscathed. The picture was also mentioned in an episode about curses in the TV series ''[[Weird or What?]]'' in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.syfy.com/weirdorwhat/episodes/season/2/episode/204/curses Curses in Weird or What?] on [[SyFy]]&lt;/ref&gt;

''''' The Unsinkable Molly Brown''''' is a 1960 [[musical theater|musical]] with music and lyrics by [[Meredith Willson]] and [[Libretto|book]] by Richard Morris. The plot is a fictionalized account of the life of [[Margaret Brown]], who survived the [[sinking of the RMS Titanic|sinking of the RMS ''Titanic'']], and her wealthy miner-husband. A [[musical film]] version also titled ''[[The Unsinkable Molly Brown (film)|The Unsinkable Molly Brown]]'', with screenplay by [[Helen Deutsch]], was released in 1964.

==Productions==
The original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production opened at the [[Winter Garden Theatre]] on November 3, 1960 and closed on February 10, 1962 after 532 performances and 1 preview. It was  directed by [[Dore Schary]] and choreographed by [[Peter Gennaro]]. The opening cast included [[Tammy Grimes]], [[Harve Presnell]], and [[Jack Harrold]]. Grimes won the [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Musical]]. Grimes appeared in the US national tour in 1962, including Los Angeles and San Francisco in April and June 1962, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Zolotow, Sam. "Schary To Stage Play About Files", ''The New York Times'', April 2, 1962, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

Presnell reprised his stage role for the 1964 film, also entitled ''[[The Unsinkable Molly Brown (film)|The Unsinkable Molly Brown]]'' starring [[Debbie Reynolds]]. The two starred in a 1989-1990 national tour.&lt;ref&gt;Churnin, Nancy.[http://articles.latimes.com/1989-08-25/entertainment/ca-814_1_unsinkable-molly-brown "Stage Review Debbie Reynolds Is Unsinkable in 'Molly Brown'"] ''Los Angeles Times'', August 25, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Alvin.[https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/01/nyregion/theater-debbie-reynolds-re-creates-molly.html "Debbie Reynolds Re-Creates 'Molly'"] ''The New York Times'', April 1, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[West End theatre|West End]] production, with [[Abi Finley]] and [[Sean Pol McGreevy]] in the leading roles, opened in May 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Shenton, Mark.[http://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/review.php/24559/the-unsinkable-molly-brown "'The Unsinkable Molly Brown' review"] TheStage.co.uk, June 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Readings
A reading of ''Molly Brown'', the first of the revised versions by [[Dick Scanlan]], took place in [[Denver]] at the Denver Center Theatre Company's Colorado New Play Summit in February 2009. The show was directed by [[Kathleen Marshall]] and starred Kerry O'Malley as Molly, [[Marc Kudisch]] as James Joseph "J.J." Brown, William Parry as Horace Tabor, and Linda Mugelston as Polly Pry. The story was revised "to use more elements from the real-life story" of Molly Brown.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Kenneth. [http://www.playbill.com/news/article/125791-OMalley-Is-Molly-Brown-in-Denver-Reading-of-Revised-Musical-Kudisch-Also-Stars "O'Malley Is Molly Brown in Denver Reading of Revised Musical; Kudisch Also Stars"], Playbill.com, January 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

A reading of the musical was held in May 2010. The show was directed/choreographed by [[Kathleen Marshall]], music supervision by Michael Rafter, with [[Sutton Foster]] as Molly and [[Craig Bierko]] as J.J. Brown. This reading had only Molly and J.J. as characters, cutting out all others that were in the previous version.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Kenneth.[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/139204-EXCLUSIVE-Sutton-Foster-and-Craig-Bierko-to-Star-in-Molly-Brown-Musical-Reading "EXCLUSIVE: Sutton Foster and Craig Bierko to Star in Molly Brown Musical Reading"], Playbill.com, April 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, another reading of the musical by Scanlan was staged. The creative team was the same as in May 2010, and it starred Foster and Kudisch again, [[Teal Wicks]], [[Francis Jue]] and [[Zachary James]], among others. The score consists of about half from the original musical and "the rest of the "new" score is made up songs from the late Willson's catalog."&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Kenneth. [http://www.playbill.com/news/article/158017-Sutton-Foster-and-Marc-Kudisch-Bang-Unsinkable-Molly-Browns-Tub-in-Reading-of-Revised-Musical "Sutton Foster and Marc Kudisch Bang Unsinkable Molly Brown's Tub in Reading of Revised Musical"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630073452/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/158017-Sutton-Foster-and-Marc-Kudisch-Bang-Unsinkable-Molly-Browns-Tub-in-Reading-of-Revised-Musical |date=2012-06-30 }}, Playbill.com, December 27, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Opening September 12, 2014, a full production of the Dick Scanlan revisioning was produced at the [[Denver Center for the Performing Arts]], running through October 26. The production featured Beth Malone and Burke Moses. The plotline differed significantly from the original production, opening with Molly in the ''Titanic'' lifeboat, and then flashing back to follow her life from her first visit to Leadville. The production received favorable reviews from local reviewers and a notice in the ''New York Times'', "A New Crew Salvages Old Molly Brown."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/theater/a-new-crew-salvages-old-molly-brown.html|title=A New Crew Salvages Old ‘Molly Brown’|first=Cara Joy|last=David|date=17 September 2014|accessdate=22 December 2017|website=Nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
In the early 1900s, feisty tomboy Molly Tobin wrestles with her three younger brothers&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtishows.com/show_detail.asp?showid=000076 "'The Unsinkable Molly Brown' Synopsis"] mtishows.com, accessed August 22, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;and tells them and her father that she wants to learn to read and write and to find a rich husband ("I Ain't Down Yet"). Molly makes her way to the Saddle Rock saloon in [[Leadville, Colorado]] and applies for a job. On the way to Leadville, Colorado she meets J.J. "Leadville" Johnny Brown, who falls in love with her and promises to give her whatever she wants ("I'll Never Say No"). After they marry, Johnny sells a claim and provides Molly with the money she wants, enough to enter the high social life in Denver ("Beautiful People of Denver"). Molly and Johnny, now dressed in gaudy finery, are made fun of by the Denver society people she wants to impress, and they travel to Europe, against Johnny's better instincts. 

The couple, and especially Molly, are welcomed and accepted by European royalty, but the attentions of Prince DeLong towards Molly upset Johnny and he returns to Leadville alone. Molly realizes that Johnny is her true love, and she sails for home on the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] ("Dolce Far Niente"). As the ''Titanic'' sinks and the tragedy unfolds, Molly survives in one of the lifeboats. She finally is reunited with Johnny, who has built Molly her own "castle," a beautiful home in the [[Rocky Mountains]].

==HIV exposure conviction==
Guerra's ex-boyfriend filed a complaint against him with San Diego police in August, 2013.&lt;ref name="abc7_additionalcharges" /&gt;&lt;ref name="advocate_guilty" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cbsnews_august"&gt;{{cite web|author=Crimesider Staff |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/thomas-guerra-california-man-accused-of-intentionally-spreading-hiv/ |title=California man accused of intentionally spreading HIV |publisher=CBS News |date=2015-08-29 |accessdate=2015-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 9, 2015, Guerra pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor charge of violating a California health code by failing to tell his former partner he was HIV positive. Guerra had previously pled not guilty and changed his plea the morning his trial was set to begin.&lt;ref name="cbs8_plea" /&gt;&lt;ref name="advocate_guilty"&gt;{{cite web|author=Neal Broverman |url=http://www.advocate.com/health/hiv-aids/2015/03/11/san-diego-man-pleads-guilty-spreading-hiv |title=San Diego Man Pleads Guilty to Spreading HIV |publisher=Advocate |date=2015-03-11 |accessdate=2015-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="latimes_nocontest"&gt;{{cite web|author=Tony Perry |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-hiv-plea-agreement-20150309-story.html |title=Man who fails to tell partner he is HIV positive pleads no contest |publisher=Los Angeles Times |date=2015-03-09 |accessdate=2015-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[San Diego]] City Attorney [[Jan Goldsmith]], Guerra's case was the first prosecution of willful HIV transmission in San Diego. There had also been no previous successful prosecutions across the state since the California Legislature adopted the health statute in 1995.&lt;ref name="cbs8_plea" /&gt;&lt;ref name="logo" /&gt;

Additional victims came forward after the case received media publicity; they filed cases in various California cities stating that Guerra had lied to them about being HIV-negative.&lt;ref name="abc7_additionalcharges" /&gt;&lt;ref name="abc30_charge" /&gt; Some of those cases are still pending.&lt;ref name="abc7_additionalcharges" /&gt;&lt;ref name="abc7_visalia"&gt;{{cite web|author=Mariana Jacob |url=http://abc7.com/news/visalia-man-says-another-man-knowingly-gave-him-hiv/397019/ |title=Visalia man says another man knowingly gave him HIV |publisher=ABC7-San Francisco |date=2015-11-13 |accessdate=2015-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigators found 11,000 text messages and videos in which Guerra laughed about lying to sexual partners about his HIV status.&lt;ref name="abc7_sentence"&gt;{{cite web|author=Elex Michaelson |url=http://abc7.com/news/san-diego-man-who-knowingly-spread-hiv-sentenced-to-6-months/697009/ |title=San Diego man who knowingly spread HIV sentenced to 6 months |publisher=ABC7 |date=2015-05-05 |accessdate=2015-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Yay lol. Someone getting poz that day," Guerra texted to a friend. "Poor Sucka."&lt;ref name="washingtonpost_travesty"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nydailynews_sentencing"/&gt; On 5 May 2015 Guerra was sentenced to six months in jail.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost_travesty" /&gt;&lt;ref name="latimes_6months"&gt;{{cite web|author=Tony Perry |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-hiv-positive-20150504-story.html |title=San Diego man sentenced to jail for not telling partner he is HIV positive |publisher=Los Angeles Times |date=2015-05-04 |accessdate=2015-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite pressure to file the case as a felony, which would have carried a term of up to eight years in prison,&lt;ref name="logo"/&gt; San Diego District Attorney [[Bonnie Dumanis]] had twice declined to do so. At his sentencing hearing Guerra told Judge Lewis that he had "no remorse" for his actions. He blamed the victim, who he said was "reckless" because they had met on the gay dating site [[Grindr]].&lt;ref name="washingtonpost_travesty" /&gt;&lt;ref name="logo" /&gt;

Judge Lewis said she would have liked to have given Guerra a harsher sentence, but California statutes prevented her doing so:&lt;ref name="washingtonpost_travesty" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nydailynews_sentencing" /&gt; "I don't think in my 25-plus years in law, I've ever seen somebody be so lacking of insight, blame or responsibility that you have demonstrated," she stated to Guerra before sentencing him to the maximum allowed per California statue, 6 months in jail.&lt;ref name="logo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="abc7_sentence" /&gt; San Diego City Attorney Jan Goldsmith said in a statement that the sentence "was inadequate given the damage done to the victim and the danger to the public posed by [Guerra]."&lt;ref name="logo" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4664">The '''International Military Tribunal for the Far East Charter''' (IMTFE Charter), also known as the '''Tokyo Charter''', was the decree issued by General [[Douglas MacArthur]], [[Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers]] in [[Allies of World War II|Allied]]-[[Occupation of Japan|occupied Japan]], on 19 January 1946 that set down the laws and procedures by which the [[Tokyo Trials]] were to be conducted. The charter was issued months following the [[surrender of Japan]] on September 2, 1945, which brought [[World War II]] to an end.&lt;ref name=MAC&gt;{{cite book |title=Crimes Against Humanity in International Criminal Law |date=July 27, 1999 |page=32 |author=M. Cherif Bassiouni |publisher=[[Wolters Kluwer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modeled after the [[Nuremberg Charter]], the Tokyo Charter stipulated that crimes of the Japanese could be tried. Three categories of crimes were defined: [[crimes against peace]], [[war crime]]s, and [[crimes against humanity]]. Article 6 of the Tokyo Charter also stated that holding an official position or acting pursuant to [[Superior Orders|order of his government or of a superior]] was no defense to war crimes, but that such circumstances may be considered in mitigation of punishment if the Tribunal determines that justice so requires.

Like the [[Nuremberg Trials]], the [[criminal procedure]] used by the Tokyo Trials was closer to [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] than to [[common law]], with a trial before a panel of judges rather than a [[jury trial]] and with wide allowance for [[hearsay]] evidence. Defendants who were found guilty could [[appeal]] the verdict to the [[Allied Council for Japan]]. In addition, they would be permitted to present evidence in their defense and to [[cross-examination|cross-examine]] witnesses.

Unlike the Nuremberg Charter, the Tokyo Charter was not part of a treaty or agreement among the Allies but it was substantially the same as the Nuremberg Charter. A major exception was that [[Emperor Hirohito]] was excluded from being tried for crimes against peace, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.

The Tokyo Charter differs from the Nuremberg Charter, however, in two ways. The Tokyo Charter adds the categories of persons to be held responsible and it does not make "persecution" subject to "religious" grounds. The first variance is only in the drafting of Article 5(c) of the Tokyo Charter defining crimes against humanity since the same responsibility basis exists in the Charter thought not in Article 6(c) of the Nuremberg Charter. The second variance is because the [[The Holocaust|Nazi crimes against the Jews]] did not have a counterpart in the Asian conflict.

The Nuremberg and Tokyo Charters were applicable only to major criminals, leaving other criminals to be tried by the Allies. In Germany, the Allies acted pursuant to Control Council Law No. 10 (CCL 10)&lt;ref&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/imt10.asp Nuremberg Trials Final Report Appendix D: Control Council Law No. 10]&lt;/ref&gt; in their respective zones of occupation. But they also relied on their military and national tribunals, where they applied their own laws. There was no counterpart in Japan to CCL 10 because the United States was the sole occupying power of Japan, whereas Germany was occupied by the four major Allies (United States, Great Britain, France, and the Soviet Union). The same legal issues pertaining to Article 6(c) of the Nuremberg Charter also apply to Article 5(c) of the Tokyo Charter.&lt;ref name=MAC /&gt;

{{Politics of the European Union}}
The '''Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union''' ('''TFEU'''; also referred to as the '''Treaty of Rome''') is one of two treaties forming the [[Treaties of the European Union|constitutional basis]] of the [[European Union]] (EU), the other being the [[Treaty on European Union]] (TEU; also referred to as the ''Treaty of Maastricht'').

The Treaty of Rome brought about the creation of the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC), the best-known of the [[European Communities]] (EC). It was signed on 25 March 1957 by [[Belgium]], [[French Fourth Republic|France]], [[Italy]], [[Luxembourg]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[West Germany]] and came into force on 1 January 1958. It remains one of the [[Treaties of the European Union|two most important treaties]] in the modern-day [[European Union]] (EU).

The TEEC proposed the progressive reduction of [[Tariff|customs duties]] and the establishment of a [[customs union]]. It proposed to create a single market for goods, labour, services, and capital across the EEC's member states. It also proposed the creation of a [[Common Agriculture Policy]], a [[Transport in Europe|Common Transport Policy]] and a [[European Social Fund]], and established the [[European Commission]].

The treaty's name has been retrospectively amended on several occasions since 1957. The [[Maastricht Treaty]] of 1992 removed the word "economic" from the Treaty of Rome's official title and, in 2009, the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] renamed it the "Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union".

==History==
The TFEU originated as the treaty establishing the European Economic Community (the EEC treaty), signed in Rome on 25 March 1957. On 7 February 1992, the Maastricht treaty, which led to the formation of the European Union, saw the EEC Treaty renamed as the Treaty establishing the European Community (TEC) and renumbered. The Maastricht reforms also saw the creation of the European Union's three pillar structure, of which the European Community was the major constituent part.

Following the 2005 referenda, which saw the failed attempt at launching a European Constitution, on 13 December 2007 the Lisbon treaty was signed. This saw the 'TEC' renamed as the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and, once again, renumbered. The Lisbon reforms resulted in the merging of the three pillars into the reformed European Union.

===Background===
In 1951, the [[Treaty of Paris (1951)|Treaty of Paris]] was signed, creating the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (ECSC). The Treaty of Paris was an international treaty based on international law, designed to help reconstruct the economies of the European continent, prevent war in Europe and ensure a lasting peace.
 
The original idea was conceived by [[Jean Monnet]], a senior French civil servant and it was announced by [[Robert Schuman]], the French Foreign Minister, in a declaration on 9 May 1950. The aim was to pool Franco-West German coal and steel production, because the two raw materials were the basis of the industry (including war industry) and power of the two countries. The proposed plan was that Franco-West German coal and steel production would be placed under a common [[High Authority of the European Coal and Steel Community|High Authority]] within the framework of an organisation that would be open for participation to other European countries. The underlying political objective of the European Coal and Steel Community was to strengthen Franco-German cooperation and banish the possibility of war.

France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands began negotiating the treaty. The Treaty Establishing the ECSC was signed in Paris on 18 April 1951, and entered into force on 24 July 1952. The Treaty expired on 23 July 2002, after fifty years, as was foreseen. The common market opened on 10 February 1953 for coal, iron ore and scrap, and on 1 May 1953 for steel.

Partly in the aim of creating a [[United States of Europe]], two further Communities were proposed, again by the French. A [[European Defence Community]] (EDC) and a [[European Political Community]] (EPC). While the treaty for the latter was being drawn up by the [[European Parliament|Common Assembly]], the ECSC parliamentary chamber, the EDC was rejected by the [[French Parliament]]. [[President of the European Commission|President]] [[Jean Monnet]], a leading figure behind the Communities, resigned from the High Authority in protest and began work on alternative Communities, based on economic integration rather than political integration.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond F. Mikesell, ''The Lessons of Benelux and the European Coal and Steel Community for the European Economic Community'', The American Economic Review, Vol. 48, No. 2, Papers and Proceedings of the Seventieth Annual Meeting of the American Economic Association (May, 1958), pp. 428–441&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the energy crises, the Common Assembly proposed extending the powers of the ECSC to cover other sources of energy. However, Monnet desired a separate Community to cover [[nuclear power]], and [[Louis Armand]] was put in charge of a study into the prospects of nuclear energy use in Europe. The report concluded that further nuclear development was needed, in order to fill the deficit left by the exhaustion of coal deposits and to reduce dependence on oil producers. The Benelux states and West Germany were also keen on creating a general [[Single market|common market]]; however, this was opposed by France owing to its [[Protectionism|protectionist]] policy, and Monnet thought it too large and difficult a task. In the end, Monnet proposed creating both as separate Communities to attempt to satisfy all interests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cvce.eu/obj/1957_1968_successes_and_crises-en-5136b72a-0de2-4636-bda0-27e58b6c83e8.html 1957–1968 Successes and crises] – CVCE (Centre for European Studies)&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the [[Messina Conference]] of 1955, [[Paul-Henri Spaak]] was appointed as chairman of a preparatory committee, the [[Spaak Committee]], charged with the preparation of a report on the creation of a common European market.

===Move towards a Single Market===
The [[Spaak Report]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://aei.pitt.edu/995/ The Brussels Report on the General Common Market (abridged, English translation of document commonly called the Spaak Report)] – AEI (Archive of European Integration)&lt;/ref&gt; drawn up by the ''Spaak Committee'' provided the basis for further progress and was accepted at the [[Venice Conference]] (29 and 30 May 1956) where the decision was taken to organise an [[Intergovernmental Conference]]. The report formed the cornerstone of the [[Intergovernmental Conference on the Common Market and Euratom]] at [[Castle of the Valley of the Duchess|Val Duchesse]] in 1956.

The outcome of the conference was that the new Communities would share the Common Assembly (now the Parliamentary Assembly) with the ECSC, as they would the [[European Court of Justice]]. However, they would not share the ECSC's Council of High Authority. The two new High Authorities would be called [[European Commission|Commissions]], from a reduction in their powers. France was reluctant to agree to more supranational powers; hence, the new Commissions would have only basic powers, and important decisions would have to be approved by the Council (of national Ministers), which now adopted majority voting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cvce.eu/obj/drafting_of_the_rome_treaties-en-8efe2279-ee12-4a75-aeeb-0bd547f4128f.html Drafting of the Rome Treaties] – CVCE (Centre for European Studies)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Euratom]] fostered co-operation in the nuclear field, at the time a very popular area, and the [[European Economic Community]] was to create a full [[customs union]] between members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cvce.eu/obj/a_european_atomic_energy_community-en-19bc7f11-bea1-49c7-b534-18327c303f41.html A European Atomic Energy Community] – CVCE (Centre for European Studies)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cvce.eu/obj/a_european_customs_union-en-a11a5f17-d744-479e-ba75-2c70b6058608.html A European Customs Union] – CVCE (Centre for European Studies)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Signing===
[[File:Traité CEE signatures.jpg|thumb|The signature page on the original Treaty of Rome]]
The conference led to the signing on 25 March 1957, of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community and the [[Euratom Treaty]] at the Palazzo dei Conservatori on [[Capitoline Hill]] in [[Rome]].

In March 2007, the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Today programme|Today]]'' radio programme reported that delays in printing the treaty meant that the document signed by the European leaders as the Treaty of Rome consisted of blank pages between its [[Book frontispiece|frontispiece]] and page for the signatures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/today/listenagain/ram/today1_rome_20070324.ram ''What really happened when the Treaty of Rome was signed 50 years ago'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://icwales.icnetwork.co.uk/0100news/0700world/tm_headline=eu-landmark-document-was--blank-pages-&amp;method=full&amp;objectid=18802633&amp;siteid=50082-name_page.html EU landmark document was 'blank pages']''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6483585.stm ''How divided Europe came together '']&lt;/ref&gt;

The Treaty of Rome, the original full name of which was the '''Treaty establishing the European Economic Community''' has been amended by successive treaties significantly changing its content. The 1992 [[Treaty of Maastricht]] established the European Union, the EEC becoming one of its three pillars, the [[European Community]]. Hence, the treaty was renamed the '''Treaty establishing the European Community''' ('''TEC''').

When the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] came into force in 2009, the pillar system was abandoned; hence, the EC ceased to exist as a legal entity separate from the EU. This led to the treaty being amended and renamed as the '''Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union''' ('''TFEU''').&lt;ref name="presconcl"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.consilium.europa.eu/ueDocs/cms_Data/docs/pressData/en/ec/94932.pdf|format=PDF|publisher = [[Council of the European Union]]|title = Presidency Conclusions Brussels European Council 21/22 June 2007|date = 23 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, the [[European Council]] adopted a decision to amend the Treaty by adding a new paragraph to Article 136. The additional paragraph, which enables the establishment of a [[European Stability Mechanism|financial stability mechanism]] for the [[Eurozone]], runs as follows:

{{quote|The Member States whose currency is the euro may establish a stability mechanism to be activated if indispensable to safeguard the stability of the euro area as a whole. The granting of any required financial assistance under the mechanism will be made subject to strict conditionality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eui.eu/Projects/EUDO-Institutions/Documents/SIEPS20116epa.pdf The European Treaty Amendment for the Creation of a Financial Stability Mechanism (Swedish Institute for European Policy Studies)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For details of the content of the Treaty as it stands after 2009, see [[Treaties of the European Union#Treaty on the functioning of the European Union]].

The '''Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union''' (2007) is one of two primary [[Treaties of the European Union]], alongside the [[Treaty on European Union]] (TEU). Originating as the Treaty of Rome, the TFEU forms the detailed basis of [[European Union law]], by setting out the scope of the EU's authority to legislate and the principles of law in those areas where EU law operates.

===Historical assessment===
According to the historian [[Tony Judt]], the Treaty of Rome did not represent a fundamental turning point in the [[History of the European Union|history of European integration]]:

{{quote|It is important not to overstate the importance of the Rome Treaty. It represented for the most part a declaration of future good intentions...Most of the text constituted a framework for instituting procedures designed to establish and enforce future regulations. The only truly significant innovation – the setting up under Article 177 of a European Court of Justice to which national courts would submit cases for final adjudication – would prove immensely important in later decades but passed largely unnoticed at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Judt|first=Tony|title=Postwar: A History of Europe since 1945|date=2007|publisher=Pimlico|location=London|isbn=978-0-7126-6564-3|page=303}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Present contents==
The consolidated TFEU consists of seven parts:

===Part 1, Principles===
In principles, article 1 establishes the basis of the treaty and its legal value. Articles 2 to 6 outline the competencies of the EU according to the level of powers accorded in each area. Articles 7 to 14 set out social principles, articles 15 and 16 set out public access to documents and meetings and article 17 states that the EU shall respect the status of religious, philosophical and non-confessional organisations under national law.&lt;ref name="TFEU consolidated"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:12012E/TXT&amp;from=EN|title = Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union|publisher = Eur-lex.europa.eu|format = PDF|accessdate = 17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part 2, Non-discrimination and citizenship of the Union===
The second part begins with article 18 which outlaws, within the limitations of the treaties, discrimination on the basis of nationality. Article 19 states the EU will "combat discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation". Articles 20 to 24 establishes [[Citizenship of the European Union|EU citizenship]] and accords rights to it; to free movement, [[Consulate#Consulates and embassies|consular]] protection from other states, vote and stand in [[Local election|local and]] [[Elections in the European Union|European elections]], right to petition Parliament and the [[European Ombudsman]] and to contact and receive a reply from EU institutions in their own language. Article 25 requires the Commission to report on the implementation of these rights every three years.&lt;ref name="TFEU consolidated"/&gt;

===Part 3, Union policies and internal actions===
Part 3 is the largest in the TFEU. Articles 26 to 197 concern the substantive policies and actions of the EU.

====Title I: Internal market====

====Title II: Free movement of goods====
Including the [[European Union Customs Union|customs union]]

====Title III: Agriculture and Fisheries====
[[Common Agricultural Policy]] and [[Common Fisheries Policy]]

====Title IV: Free movement of workers, services and capital====

[[Four Freedoms (European Union)|free movement of people, services and capital]]

====Title V: Area of freedom, justice and security====
Including police and justice co-operation

====Title VI: Transport====

====Title VII: Common Rules on Competition, Taxation and Approximation of Laws====
[[European Union competition law]], taxation and harmonisation of regulations (note [[Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union|Article 101]] and [[Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union|Article 102]])

====Title VIII: Economic and monetary policy====
Articles 119 to 144 concern economic and [[European Central Bank|monetary policy]], including articles on the euro. ''Chapter 1: Economic policy – Article 126'' deals with how excessive member state [[government debt|debt]] is handled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:12008E126|title=EUR-Lex – 12008E126 – EN – EUR-Lex|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Chapter 2: Monetary policy – Article 127'' outlines that the [[European System of Central Banks]] should maintain price stability and work with the principles of an open markets and free competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:12008E127|title=EUR-Lex – 12008E127 – EN – EUR-Lex|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Article 140'' describes the criteria for inclusion in monetary union (the euro) or having exception from it, and also says that it is a majority of the council, not the state alone, which decides upon usage of euro or national currency. Thereby are states obliged (except UK and Denmark) to introduce the euro if the council finds they fulfil the criteria.

====Titles IX to XV: Employment, social and consumer policy====
{{main article|European labour law|European consumer law}}
Title IX concerns employment policy, under articles 145–150. Title X concerns social policy, and with reference to the [[European Social Charter 1961]] and the [[Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers 1989]]. This gives rise to the weight of [[European labour law]].

Title XIII concerns culture, in article 167. Title XIV allows measures for public health, under article 168. Title XV empowers the EU to act for consumer protection, in article 169.

====Titles XVI to XXIV Networks, industry, environment, energy, other====
Title XVI, articles 170–172 empower action to develop and integrate [[Trans-European Networks]]. Title XVII, article 173, regards the EU's industrial policy, to promote industry. Title XVIII, articles 174 to 178 concern economic, social and territorial cohesion (reducing disparities in development). Title XIX concerns research and development and space policy, under which the [[European Research Area]] and [[European Space Policy]] are developed.

Title XX concerns the increasingly important environmental policy, allowing action under articles 191 to 193. Title XXI, article 194, establishes the [[Energy policy of the European Union]].

Title XXII, article 195 is tourism. Title XXIII, article 196 is civil protection. Title XXIV, article 197 is administrative co-operation.

===Part 4, Association of the overseas countries and territories===
Part 4, in articles 198 to 204, deals with association of overseas territories. Article 198 sets the objective of association as promoting the economic and social development of those associated territories as listed in annexe 2. The following articles elaborate on the form of association such as customs duties.&lt;ref name="TFEU consolidated"/&gt;

===Part 5, External action by the Union===
Part 5, in articles 205 to 222, deals with [[Common Foreign and Security Policy|EU foreign policy]]. Article 205 states that external actions must be in accordance with the principles laid out in Chapter 1 Title 5 of the Treaty on European Union. Article 206 and 207 establish the [[common commercial (external trade) policy of the EU]]. Articles 208 to 214 deal with co-operation on development and humanitarian aid for third countries. Article 215 deals with [[International sanctions|sanctions]] while articles 216 to 219 deal with procedures for establishing international treaties with third countries. Article 220 instructs the High Representative and Commission to engage in appropriate co-operation with other international organisations and article 221 establishes the [[List of diplomatic missions of the European Union|EU delegations]]. Article 222, the ''Solidarity clause'' states that members shall come to the aid of a fellow member who is subject to a terrorist attack, natural disaster or man-made disaster. This includes the use of military force.&lt;ref name="TFEU consolidated"/&gt;

===Part 6, Institutional and financial provisions===
Part 6, in articles 223 to 334, elaborates on the institutional provisions in the Treaty on European Union. As well as elaborating on the structures, articles 288 to 299 outline the forms of [[Legislature of the European Union|legislative acts and procedures of the EU]]. Articles 300 to 309 establish the [[European Economic and Social Committee]], the [[Committee of the Regions]] and the [[European Investment Bank]]. Articles 310 to 325 outline the [[Budget of the European Union|EU budget]]. Finally, articles 326 to 334 establishes provision for [[enhanced co-operation]].&lt;ref name="TFEU consolidated"/&gt;

===Part 7, General and final provisions===
Part 7, in articles 335 to 358, deals with final legal points, such as territorial and temporal application, the seat of institutions (to be decided by member states, but this is enacted by a protocol attached to the treaties), immunities and the effect on treaties signed before 1958 or the date of accession.&lt;ref name="TFEU consolidated"/&gt;

'''Triplemanía II-B''' was a major ''[[lucha libre]]'', or [[professional wrestling]] event [[Asistencia Asesoría y Administración]] (AAA) that took place at ''[[Auditorio Benito Juárez]]'' in [[Zapopan, Jalisco]] on May 15, 1994. The show was the second of three Triplemanía II shows held in 1994, preceded by [[Triplemanía II-A]], with a subsequent show held in 12 days later. 1994 was the first year AAA held multiple Triplemanía shows in a year, a tradition they would continue through 1997, after which Triplemanía became a single annual event. The annual Triplemanía show(s) are AAA's biggest show of the year, serving as the culmination of major storylines and feature wrestlers from all over the world competing in what has been described as AAA's version of [[WrestleMania]] or their [[Super Bowl]] event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Madigan, Dan|title=Mondo Lucha Libre: the bizarre and honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling|publisher=HarperColins Publisher|year=2007|chapter=A family affair|pages=128–132|isbn=978-0-06-085583-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Main event featured a [[Professional wrestling tag team match types#Trios rules (Relevos Australianos)|Six-man "Lucha Libre rules" tag team match]] between the teams of [[Konnan]], [[Perro Aguayo]], and [[Cien Caras]] and the ''[[Los Gringos Locos]]'' team of [[Jake Roberts]], [[Art Barr|Love Machine]], and [[Miguel Pérez Jr.]]. The semi-main event featured a best two-out-of-three falls ''[[Lucha de Apuestas]]'', or bet match where both [[Máscara Sagrada]] and [[Victor Mar Manuel|Black Cat]] put their mask on the line in the match. The show featured Japanese wrestlers [[Jushin Thunder Liger]] and [[Tiger Mask III]] on loan from [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] (NJPW). The fifth match of the night featured wrestlers who had worked primarily for the [[Universal Wrestling Association]] (UWA) until that point, [[Shu el Guerrero]], [[Scorpio, Jr.]], and [[Gran Hamada]], fighting AAA representatives ''[[Los Payasos]]'' ("The Clowns"; Coco Rojo, Coco Verde and Coco Amarillo)

==Production==

===Background===
AAA founder [[Antonio Peña]] had originally envisioned the [[Triplemanía]] series as three shows held over the summer, but for the first year AAA only held 1 show, [[Triplemanía I]]. In 1994 AAA announced that they would hold three Triplemanía shows, building the storylines into its climax at the third and final Triplemanía II show. The first show, [[Triplemanía II-A]], would take place in the outdoor baseball stadium in [[Aguascalientes, Aguascalientes]] on April 26, the second show, Triplemanía II-B, would be at the [[Estadio Olímpico Benito Juárez]] in [[Zapopan, Jalisco]] on May 15 and the third and final Triplemanía II show, [[Triplemanía II-C]],  would happen at the [[Plaza de Toros Monumental de Tijuana|El Toro]] [[bullfighting]] arena in [[Tijuana]], [[Baja California]] on May 27, 1994.&lt;ref name="Trip2B"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Trip2"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/triple.html#ii-a | title = Asistencia Asesoría y Administración TripleManía | accessdate = 2009-02-19| publisher = ProWrestlingHistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TripleSlam&gt;{{cite web | url=http://slam.canoe.com/SlamWrestlingInternational/triplemania.html | title=TripleMania: Mexico's answer to WrestleMania | first=John F. | last=Molinaro | year=2000 | accessdate=June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trip2C"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/triple.html#ii-c | title = Asistencia Asesoría y Administración TripleManía | accessdate = 2009-02-19| publisher = ProWrestlingHistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Storylines===
[[File:Jushin Thunder Liger 2014.JPG|left|thumb|[[Jushin Thunder Liger]] traveled from Japan for the show.]]
The Triplemanía show featured eight [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]] with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing [[Screenplay|scripted]] feuds, [[plot (narrative)|plots]] and [[narrative thread|storylines]]. Wrestlers were portrayed as either [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]] (referred to as ''rudos'' in Mexico, those that portray the "bad guys") or [[Face (professional wrestling)|faces]] (''técnicos'' in Mexico, the "good guy" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

==Aftermath==
The show was a direct build to [[Triplemanía II-C]] held only 12 days later in [[Tijuana]], [[Baja California]]. Triplemanía II-C saw Konnan finally gain revenge on Jake Roberts as he defeated Roberts in two straight falls to force him to be shaved bald after the match. Most of AAA's roster, both ''tecnicos'' and ''rudos'', came to the ring after the match to show their unity and to ensure Roberts had his hair shaved off. Roberts would remain with AAA for several months after the show but was not involved in any major storylines after the loss to Konnan. The ''Los Gringos Locos'' storyline carried AAA into their subsequent major shows "Night of Champions" and later on their first ever [[pay-per-view]] (PPV) [[AAA When Worlds Collide]] that was driven by the feud between ''a Pareja del Terror'' (Eddy Guerrero and Love Machine) facing off against El Hijo del Santo and Octagón in a ''Luchas de Apuestas'' match where Guerrero and Love Machine ended up losing their hair.&lt;ref name="AlmanacWorlds"&gt;{{cite news|title=Historical Cards|work=PWI Presents: 2007 Wrestling Almanak and book of facts|publisher=Kappa Publications|id=2007 Edition|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; 19 days afterwards Love Machine, real name Art Barr, dies of unknown causes.&lt;ref name=BarrRemembered&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.com/WrestlingStarBios/barr_art.html |title=Art Barr: What could have been; Looking back at Love Machine's career|last=Molinaro|first=John|accessdate=2008-10-12|work=Slam! Sports|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of Konnan in the wake of his victory over Jake Robers made his turn to the ''rudo'' side months later ever more shocking, with Konnan attacking his longtime friend Perro Aguayo during a match and joining ''Los Gringos Locos'' instead.&lt;ref name=AAAOficial&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.luchalibreaaa.com/historia/when-worlds-collide.html | title= El evento que comenzo la revolucion mundial | publisher=[[Asistencia Asesoría y Administración]] | accessdate=June 27, 2015 | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; At "When Worlds Collide" Aguayo defeated Konnan in a [[steel cage match]].&lt;ref name="AlmanacWorlds"/&gt;

A few days after the show the then-[[Mexican National Middleweight Championship|Mexican National Middleweight Champion]] was involved in a car accident where he injured his hand. Due to the injury the local boxing and wrestling commission could not give him medical clearance to wrestle against [[Blue Panther]] at Triplemanía II-C, causing him to forfeit the championship to Blue Panther.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Royal Duncan and Gary Will|title=Wrestling Title Histories|publisher=Archeus Communications|chapter=Mexico: National Middleweight Championship|page=392|year=2000|isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Los Reyes de Mexico: La Historia de Los Campeonatos Nacionales|work=Lucha 2000|id=Especial 21|date=2004-12-20|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
John Molinario, who writes about wrestling for the [[Canadian Online Explorer]], described the show as "possibly the best TripleMania show ever." and stated that it was "from top to bottom a sensational show".&lt;ref name=TripleSlam/&gt; ''[[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]'' founder and editor [[Dave Meltzer]] commented that the "show was awesome. It was among the greatest shows I probably ever saw" after witnessing the show live and in person.&lt;ref name=TripleSlam/&gt; Meltzer rated the "Atómicos" tag team match at four-and-a-half star, the ''lucha de apuestas'' match at four-and-three-quarters stars, while giving the main event six-man tag team match four stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&amp;nr=23188 | title=AAA TripleMania II - B | accessdate=July 12, 2015 | publisher=Cagematch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Campaignbox Six-Day War}}
The '''USS ''Liberty'' incident''' was an attack on a [[United States Navy]] [[technical research ship]], {{USS|Liberty|AGTR-5|6}}, by [[Israeli Air Force]] jet [[fighter aircraft]] and [[Israeli Navy]] [[motor torpedo boat]]s, on 8 June 1967, during the [[Six-Day War]].&lt;ref name=NSAhistory1n2n5n25n26n28&gt;{{harvnb|Gerhard|Millington|1981|p=1,2,5,25,26,28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combined air and sea attack killed 34 crew members (naval officers, seamen, two marines, and one civilian), wounded 171 crew members, and severely damaged the ship.&lt;ref name=NSAhistory292652&gt;{{harvnb|Gerhard|Millington|1981|pp=29,28,52}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the ship was in [[international waters]] north of the [[Sinai Peninsula]], about {{convert|25.5|nmi|mi km|lk=in|abbr=on}} northwest from the Egyptian city of [[Arish]].&lt;ref name="Wikimapia"/&gt;&lt;ref name=NSAhistory26&gt;{{harvnb|Gerhard|Millington|1981|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel apologized for the attack, saying that the USS ''Liberty'' had been attacked in error after being mistaken for an Egyptian ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cristol|first=A.Jay|title=The Liberty Incident Revealed: The Definitive Account of the 1967 Israeli Attack on the U.S. Navy Spy Ship|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5a1kAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT252|year=2013|publisher=Naval Institute Press|isbn=978-1-61251-387-4|pages=61, 113–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the Israeli and [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. governments]] conducted inquiries and issued reports that concluded the attack was a mistake due to Israeli confusion about the ship's identity,&lt;ref name="NSAhistory57"&gt;{{harvnb|Gerhard|Millington|1981|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; though others, including survivors of the attack, have rejected these conclusions and maintain that the attack was deliberate.&lt;ref name=trib&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-liberty_tuesoct02,0,66005.story | title=New revelations in attack on American spy ship | first=John |last=Crewdson | date=2 October 2007 | work=[[Chicago Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1968, the [[Israeli government]] paid {{USD|{{Format price|3323500}}}} (equivalent to {{USD|{{Format price|{{Inflation|US|3,323,500|1968}}}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}) to the {{no wrap|U.S. government}} in compensation to the families of the 34 men killed in the attack. In March 1969, Israel paid a further ${{Format price|3566457}} (${{Format price|{{Inflation|US|3566457|1969}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}) to the men who had been wounded. In December 1980, it agreed to pay ${{Format price|6000000}} (${{Format price|{{Inflation|US|6000000|1980}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}) as the final settlement for material damage to ''Liberty'' itself plus 13 years of interest.&lt;ref name=NSAhistory64&gt;{{harvnb|Gerhard|Millington|1981|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==USS ''Liberty''==
{{Main|USS Liberty (AGTR-5)}}
{{USS|Liberty|AGTR-5|6}} was originally the {{convert|7725|LT|t|abbr=on}} (light) civilian cargo vessel ''Simmons Victory'', a mass-produced, standard-design [[Victory Ship]], the follow-on series to the famous [[Liberty Ship]] that supplied the Allies with cargo during World War Two. It was acquired by the [[United States Navy]], converted to an [[AGTR|Auxiliary Technical Research Ship]] (AGTR),&lt;ref name=NSAhistory2&gt;{{harvnb|Gerhard|Millington|1981|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a cover name for [[NSA]] "spy ships" doing [[signals intelligence]]) and began its first deployment in 1965, to waters off the west coast of Africa. It carried out several more operations during the next two years.

==Attack on the ''Liberty''==

===Events leading to the attack===
During the [[Six-Day War]] between [[Israel]] and several [[Arab]] nations, the United States of America maintained a [[neutral country]] status.&lt;ref name=NSAhistory1&gt;{{harvnb|Gerhard|Millington|1981|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several days before the war began, the USS ''Liberty'' was ordered to proceed to the eastern [[Mediterranean]] area to perform a [[SIGINT|signals intelligence]] collection mission in international waters near the north coast of Sinai, Egypt.&lt;ref name=NSAhistory5&gt;{{harvnb|Gerhard|Millington|1981|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war erupted, due to concerns about its safety as it approached its patrol area, several messages were sent to ''Liberty'' to increase its allowable closest point of approach (CPA) to Egypt's and Israel's coasts from {{convert|12.5|and|6.5|nmi|mi km|abbr=on}}, respectively, to {{convert|20|and|15|nmi|mi km|abbr=on}}, and then later to {{convert|100|nmi|mi km|abbr=on}} for both countries.&lt;ref name=NSAhistory21&gt;{{harvnb|Gerhard|Millington|1981|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, due to ineffective message handling and routing, the CPA change messages were not received until after the attack.&lt;ref name="NSAhistory21"/&gt;

According to Israeli sources, at the start of the war on 5 June, General [[Yitzhak Rabin]] (then IDF [[Ramatkal|Chief of Staff]]) informed [[Commander (United States)|Commander]] [[Ernest Carl Castle]], the American Naval Attaché in [[Tel Aviv]], that Israel would defend its coast with every means at its disposal, including sinking unidentified ships. Also, he asked the U.S. to keep its ships away from Israel's shore or at least inform Israel of their exact position.{{sfn|IDF History Report|1982|page=22}}{{efn |The failure of the Israeli navy's attacks on Egyptian and Syrian ports early in the war did little to assuage Israel's fears. Consequently, the IDF Chief of Staff, Gen. Yitzhak Rabin, informed the U.S. Naval Attaché in Tel Aviv, Cmdr. [[Ernest Carl Castle]], that Israel would defend its coast with every means at its disposal. Unidentified vessels would be sunk, Rabin advised; the United States should either acknowledge its ships in the area or remove them. The U.S. had also rejected Israel's request for a formal naval liaison. On 31 May, [[Avraham Harman]], Israel's ambassador to Washington, had warned Under Secretary of State [[Eugene V. Rostow]] that if war breaks out, "we would have no telephone number to call, no code for plane recognition, and no way to get in touch with the [[United States Sixth Fleet|U.S. Sixth Fleet]]." {{harv|Oren|2000}} }}

American sources said that no inquiry about ships in the area was made until after the ''Liberty'' attack ended. In a message sent from U.S. Secretary of State [[Dean Rusk]] to U.S. Ambassador [[Walworth Barbour]], in Tel Aviv, Israel, Rusk asked for "urgent confirmation" of Israel's statement. Barbour responded: "No request for info on U.S. ships operating off Sinai was made until after ''Liberty'' incident." Further, Barbour stated: "Had Israelis made such an inquiry it would have been forwarded immediately to the chief of naval operations and other high naval commands and repeated to dept [Department of State]."&lt;ref name="JamesScottBookp197"&gt;{{harvnb|Scott|2009|p=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the outbreak of war, Captain [[William McGonagle|William L. McGonagle]] of ''Liberty'' immediately asked [[Vice Admiral (United States)|Vice Admiral]] William I. Martin at the [[United States Sixth Fleet]] headquarters to send a destroyer to accompany ''Liberty'' and serve as its armed escort and as an auxiliary communications center. The following day, 6 June, Admiral Martin replied: "''Liberty'' is a clearly marked United States ship in international waters, not a participant in the conflict and not a reasonable subject for attack by any nation. Request denied."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ennes|1987|pages=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; He promised, however, that in the unlikely event of an inadvertent attack, jet fighters from the Sixth Fleet would be overhead in ten minutes.&lt;!-- 5 Jan 2012: no reference to a primary source (e.g., copy of messages or official report) seems to exist that supports statements in this paragraph. Thus, these secondary source claims cannot be verified. --&gt;

Meanwhile, on 6 June, at the United Nations, in response to [[United Arab Republic]] complaints that the United States was supporting Israel in the conflict, U.S. Ambassador [[Arthur Goldberg]] said to the [[Security Council]] that aircraft of the Sixth Fleet were several hundred miles from the conflict,&lt;ref name=NSAhistory21/&gt; indicating that elements of the Sixth Fleet itself were far from the conflict. When the statement was made this was the case, since ''Liberty'', now assigned to the Sixth Fleet, was in the central Mediterranean Sea, passing between Libya and Crete;&lt;ref name=NSAhistory20&gt;{{harvnb|Gerhard|Millington|1981|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it would ultimately steam to about {{convert|13|nmi|mi km|abbr=on}} north of the Sinai Peninsula.&lt;ref name=NSAhistory25&gt;{{harvnb|Gerhard|Millington|1981|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of 7 June Washington time, early morning on 8 June, 01:10[[Coordinated Universal Time|Z]] or 3:10&amp;nbsp;am local time, the Pentagon issued an order to Sixth Fleet headquarters to tell ''Liberty'' to come no closer than {{convert|100|nmi|mi km|abbr=on}} to Israel, Syria, or the Sinai coast (Oren, p.&amp;nbsp;263).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsa.gov/liberty/51668/3084841.pdf|accessdate=17 June 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070628075318/http://www.nsa.gov/liberty/51668/3084841.pdf |archivedate=28 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5, 58 (Exhibit N)}}

According to the Naval Court of Inquiry&lt;ref name=USNCOIreport&gt;[http://www.thelibertyincident.com/docs/CourtOfInquiry.pdf U.S. Naval Court of Inquiry] Court of Inquiry for USS ''Liberty'' attack, Record of Proceedings, 18 June 1967&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|23 ff, 111 ff}} and National Security Agency official history,&lt;ref name=NSAhistory2123&gt;{{harvnb|NSA History Report|pp=21–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; the order to withdraw was not sent on the radio frequency that ''Liberty'' monitored for her orders until 15:25 [[Coordinated Universal Time|Zulu]], several hours after the attack, due to a long series of administrative and message routing problems. The Navy said a large volume of unrelated high-precedence traffic, including intelligence intercepts related to the conflict, were being handled at the time; and that this combined with a shortage of qualified [[Radioman|Radiomen]] contributed to delayed sending of the withdrawal message.&lt;ref name=USNCOIreport/&gt;{{rp|111 ff}}

===Visual contact===

Official testimony combined with ''Liberty's'' deck log say that throughout the morning of the attack, 8 June, the ship was overflown, at various times and locations, by [[Israeli Air Force]] (IAF) aircraft.&lt;ref name=NSAhistory25/&gt; The primary aircraft type was the [[Nord Noratlas]]; there were also two unidentified delta-wing jets at about 9:00&amp;nbsp;am Sinai time ([[GMT]]+2).&lt;ref name=NSAhistory25/&gt;  ''Liberty'' crewmembers say that one of the Noratlas aircraft flew so close to ''Liberty'' that noise from its propellers rattled the ship's deck plating, and that the pilots and crewmembers waved to each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ennes|1987|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later reported, based on information from Israel Defense Forces sources, that the over-flights were coincidental, and that the aircraft were hunting for Egyptian submarines that had been spotted near the coast.&lt;ref name="Oren"/&gt;

At about 5:45&amp;nbsp;am Sinai time, a ship-sighting report was received at Israeli Central Coastal Command (CCC) about ''Liberty'', identified by an aerial naval observer as "apparently a [[destroyer]], sailing {{convert|70|miles|disp=sqbr}} west of Gaza".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|IDF History Report|1982|pp=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vessel's location was marked on a CCC Control Table, using a red marker, indicating an unidentified vessel.&lt;ref name=IDFHR7&gt;{{harvnb|IDF History Report|1982|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; At about 6:00&amp;nbsp;am, the aerial naval observer, Major Uri Meretz, reported that the ship appeared like a U.S. Navy supply ship; the red marker was replaced with a green marker to indicate a neutral vessel, at about 9:00&amp;nbsp;am.&lt;ref name=IDFHR7/&gt; At that same time, an Israeli jet fighter pilot reported that a ship {{convert|20|miles}} north of Arish had fired at his aircraft after he tried to identify the vessel.&lt;ref name=IDFHR7/&gt; Israeli naval command dispatched two destroyers to investigate, but they were returned to their previous positions at 9:40&amp;nbsp;am after doubts emerged during the pilot's debriefing.&lt;ref name=IDFHR7/&gt; After the naval observer's Noratlas landed and he was debriefed, the ship he saw was further identified as the USS ''Liberty'', based on its "GTR-5" hull markings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|IDF History Report|1982|pp=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; USS ''Liberty's'' marker was removed from CCC's Control Table at 11:00&amp;nbsp;am, due to its positional information being considered stale.&lt;ref name="IDFHR8"&gt;{{harvnb|IDF History Report|1982|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 11:24&amp;nbsp;am, Israeli Chief of Naval Operations received a report that Arish was being shelled from the sea.&lt;ref name="IDFHR8"/&gt; An inquiry into the source of the report was ordered to determine its validity.&lt;ref name=IDFHR8/&gt; The report came from an Air Support Officer in Arish.&lt;ref name=IDFHR10&gt;{{harvnb|IDF History Report|1982|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, at 11:27&amp;nbsp;am Israeli Supreme Command Head of Operations received a report stating that a ship had been shelling Arish, but the shells had fallen short.&lt;ref name=IDFHR10/&gt; (Investigative journalist [[James Bamford]] points out that ''Liberty'' had only four [[M2 Browning|.50 caliber machine guns]] mounted on her decks and, thus, could not have shelled the coast.&lt;ref name="Bamford, Body of Secrets"&gt;Bamford, Body of Secrets&lt;/ref&gt;
) The Head of Operations ordered that the report be verified, and determine whether or not Israeli Navy vessels were off the coast of Arish.&lt;ref name=IDFHR10/&gt; At 11:45&amp;nbsp;am, another report arrived at Supreme Command saying two ships were approaching the Arish coast.&lt;ref name=IDFHR10/&gt;

The shelling and ships reports were passed from Supreme Command to Fleet Operations Control Center.&lt;ref name=IDFHR10/&gt; The Chief of Naval Operations took them seriously, and at 12:05&amp;nbsp;pm torpedo boat Division 914 was ordered to patrol in the direction of Arish.&lt;ref name=IDFHR10/&gt;

[[File:Tsqd914.jpg|thumb|right|Israeli Motor Torpedo Boats (MTBs) in formation, c. 1967. These were the MTBs that attacked USS ''Liberty''.]]

Division 914, codenamed "[[Pagoda]]", was under the command of Commander Moshe Oren.&lt;ref name=IDFHR10/&gt; It consisted of three torpedo boats numbered: T-203, T-204 and T-206.&lt;ref name=IDFHR10/&gt;  At 12:15&amp;nbsp;pm, Division 914 received orders to patrol a position {{convert|20|miles}} north of Arish.&lt;ref name=IDFHR10/&gt; As Commander Oren headed toward Arish, he was informed by Naval Operations of the reported shelling of Arish and told that IAF aircraft would be dispatched to the area after the target had been detected.&lt;ref name=IDFHR10/&gt;

Chief of Staff Yitzhak Rabin was concerned that the supposed Egyptian shelling was the prelude to an amphibious landing that could outflank Israeli forces. Rabin reiterated the standing order to sink any unidentified ships in the area, but advised caution, as Soviet vessels were reportedly operating nearby.&lt;ref name="Oren"/&gt;

At 1:41&amp;nbsp;pm, the torpedo boats detected an unknown vessel 20 miles northwest of Arish and {{convert|14|miles}} off the coast of [[Bardawil]].&lt;ref name="Wikimapia"/&gt;&lt;ref name=IDFHR11&gt;{{harvnb|IDF History Report|1982|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ship's speed was estimated on their radars.&lt;ref name=IDFHR11/&gt; The Combat Information Center officer on T-204, Ensign Aharon Yifrah, reported to the boat's captain, Commander Moshe Oren, that the target had been detected at a range of {{convert|22|miles}}, that her speed had been tracked for a few minutes, after which he had determined that the target was moving westward at a speed of {{convert|30|knots}}. These data were forwarded to the Fleet Operations Control Center.&lt;ref name=IDFHR11/&gt;

The speed of the target was significant because it indicated that the target was a combat vessel.&lt;ref name=IDFHR11/&gt; Moreover, Israeli forces had standing orders to fire on any unknown vessels sailing in the area at over {{convert|20|knots}}, a speed which, at the time, could only be attained by warships. The Chief of Naval Operations asked the torpedo boats to double-check their calculations. Yifrah twice recalculated and confirmed his assessment.&lt;ref name="Oren"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IDFHR11"/&gt; A few minutes later, Commander Oren reported that the target, now {{convert|17|miles}} from his position, was moving at a speed of {{convert|28|knots}} on a different heading.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thelibertyincident.com/docs/israeli/yerushalmi-report-en.pdf Yerushalmi Inquiry Report] p 3&lt;/ref&gt; Bamford, however, points out that ''Liberty''{{'}}s top speed was far below 28 knots. His sources say that at the time of the attack ''Liberty'' was following her signal-intercept mission course along the northern Sinai coast, at about {{convert|5|knots}} speed.&lt;ref name="Bamford, Body of Secrets"/&gt;

The data on the ship's speed, together with its direction, indicated that it was an Egyptian destroyer fleeing toward port after shelling Arish. The torpedo boats gave chase, but did not expect to overtake their target before it reached Egypt. Commander Oren requested that the [[Israeli Air Force]] dispatch aircraft to intercept.&lt;ref name="Oren"/&gt;&lt;ref name=IDFHR11/&gt; At 1:48&amp;nbsp;pm, the Chief of Naval Operations requested dispatch of fighter aircraft to the ship's location.&lt;ref name=IDFHR12&gt;{{harvnb|IDF History Report|1982|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:D2 1 b.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hunt-class destroyer]] HMS ''Blean''. The Egyptian Navy had Hunt-class destroyers in 1967]]
The IAF dispatched two [[Dassault Mirage III|Mirage III]] fighter jets that arrived at ''Liberty'' at about {{nowrap|2:00 pm}}.&lt;ref name="IDFHR13"&gt;{{harvnb|IDF History Report|1982|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The formation leader, Captain [[Iftach Spector]], attempted to identify the ship.&lt;ref name=IDFHR13/&gt; He communicated via radio to one of the torpedo boats his observation that the ship appeared like a military ship with one smokestack and one mast.&lt;ref name=IDFRRIR5&gt;{{harvnb|IDF Ram Ron Report|1967|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, he communicated, in effect, that the ship appeared to him like a destroyer or another type of small ship.&lt;ref name=IDFRRIR5/&gt; In a post-attack statement, the pilots said they saw no distinguishable markings or flag on the ship.&lt;ref name=IDFRRIR5/&gt;

At this point, a recorded exchange took place between a command headquarters weapons systems officer, one of the air controllers, and the chief air controller questioning a possible American presence. Immediately after the exchange, at 1:57&amp;nbsp;pm, the chief air controller, Lieutenant-Colonel Shmuel Kislev, cleared the Mirages to attack.&lt;ref name="Oren"/&gt;&lt;ref name=JamesScottBookp215&gt;{{harvnb|Scott|2009|p=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air and sea attacks===
After being cleared to attack, the Mirages dove on the ship and attacked with 30-mm cannons and rockets.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Scott|2009|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attack came a few minutes after the crew completed a chemical attack drill, with Captain McGonagle on the command bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Scott|2009|p=44,45,46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crew was in "stand-down mode", with their helmets and life jackets removed,&lt;ref name="Oren"&gt;[[Michael Oren|Oren, Michael B.]] – ''[[Six Days of War|Six Days of War: June 1967 and the Making of the Modern Middle East]]''&lt;/ref&gt; except battle readiness "modified condition three" was set which meant that the ship's four .50 caliber machine guns were manned and ammunition ready for loading and firing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gerhard|Millington|1981|p=25,26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Scott|2009|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight crewmen were either killed immediately or received fatal injuries and died later, and 75 were wounded.&lt;ref name="NSAhistory28"&gt;{{harvnb|Gerhard|Millington|1981|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the wounded was McGonagle, who was hit in the right thigh and arm.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Scott|2009|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the attack, antennas were severed, gas drums caught fire, and the ship's flag was knocked down. McGonagle sent an urgent request for help to the Sixth Fleet, "Under attack by unidentified jet aircraft, require immediate assistance."

The Mirages left after expending their ammunition, and were replaced by two [[Dassault Mystere]]s armed with [[napalm]] bombs, flown by Captain Yossi Zuk and his wingman, Yaakov Hamermish. The Mysteres released their payloads over the ship and strafed it with their cannons. Much of the ship's superstructure caught fire.&lt;ref name="Oren"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IDFHR13"/&gt; The Mysteres were readying to attack again when the Israeli Navy, alerted by the absence of return fire, warned Kislev that the target could be Israeli. Kislev told the pilots not to attack if there was any doubt about identification, and the Israeli Navy quickly contacted all of its vessels in the area. The Israeli Navy found that none of its vessels were under fire, and the aircraft were cleared to attack. However, Kislev was still disturbed by a lack of return fire, and requested one last attempt to identify the ship. Captain Zuk, made an attempt at identification while strafing the ship. He reported seeing no flag, but saw the ship's GTR-5 marking. Kislev immediately ordered the attack stopped. Kislev guessed that the ship was American.&lt;ref name="Oren"/&gt;

The fact that the ship had Latin alphabet markings led Chief of Staff Rabin to fear that the ship was Soviet. Though Egyptian warships were known to disguise their identities with Western markings, they usually displayed Arabic letters and numbers only. Rabin ordered the torpedo boats to remain at a safe distance from the ship, and sent in two [[List of aircraft of the Israeli Air Force#Helicopters|Hornet (Aérospatiale Super Frelon) helicopters]] to search for survivors. These radio communications were recorded by Israel. The order also was recorded in the torpedo boat's log, although Commander Oren alleged not to have received it. The order to cease fire was given at 2:20&amp;nbsp;pm, twenty-four minutes before the torpedo boats arrived at the ''Liberty''{{'}}s position.{{efn|While Egyptian naval ships were known to disguise their identities with Western markings, they usually displayed Arabic letters and numbers only. The fact that the ship had Western markings led Rabin to fear that it was Soviet, and he immediately called off the jets. Two IAF Hornet helicopters were sent to look for survivors—Spector had reported seeing men overboard—while the torpedo boat squadron was ordered to hold its fire pending further attempts at identification. Though that order was recorded in the torpedo boat's log, [the commander], Oren, claimed he never received it." {{harv|Oren|2000}} }} At 2:35&amp;nbsp;pm, ''Liberty'' was hit by a torpedo launched from one of the torpedo boats.&lt;ref name="Gerhard 1981 29"&gt;{{harvnb|Gerhard|Millington|1981|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the interval, crewmen aboard ''Liberty'' hoisted a large American flag. During the early part of the air attack and before the torpedo boats were sighted, ''Liberty'' sent a distress message that was received by Sixth Fleet aircraft carrier [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS ''Saratoga'']].&lt;ref name="NSAhistory28"/&gt; Aircraft carrier [[USS America (CV-66)|USS ''America'']] dispatched eight aircraft. The carrier had been in the middle of strategic exercises. Vice-Admiral William I. Martin recalled the aircraft minutes later.&lt;ref name="Oren"/&gt;

McGonagle testified at the naval court of inquiry that during "the latter moments of the air attack, it was noted that three high speed boats were approaching the ship from the northeast on a relative bearing of approximately 135 [degrees] at a distance of about 15 [nautical] miles. The ship at the time was still on [westward] course 283 [degrees] true, speed unknown, but believed to be in excess of five knots."&lt;ref name=USNCOIreport/&gt;{{rp|38}} McGonagle testified that he "believed that the time of initial sighting of the torpedo boats ... was about 14:20", and that the "boats appeared to be in a wedge type formation with the center boat the lead point of the wedge. Estimated speed of the boats was about {{convert|27|to|30|kn|km/h|disp=sqbr}}," and that it "appeared that they were approaching the ship in a torpedo launch attitude".&lt;ref name=USNCOIreport/&gt;{{rp|38}}

When the torpedo boats arrived, Commander Oren could see that the ship could not be the destroyer that had supposedly shelled Arish or any ship capable of {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} speed. According to Michael Limor, an Israeli naval reservist serving on one of the torpedo boats, they attempted to contact the ship by heliograph and radio, but received no response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Israeli Seaman Describes Attack |work=Owosso [[Argus-Press]] |location=Owosso, Michigan |date=6 July 1967 |page=12 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1978&amp;dat=19670706&amp;id=wnUiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=H6wFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=595,422193&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; At {{convert|6,000|meters|sp=us}}, T-204 paused and signalled "AA" – "identify yourself."{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} Due to damaged equipment, McGonagle could only reply with "AA" using a handheld [[Signal lamp|Aldis lamp]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} Oren recalled receiving a similar response from the ''[[Ibrahim el Awal]]'', an Egyptian destroyer captured by Israel during the [[Suez Crisis]], and was convinced that he was facing an enemy ship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

He consulted an Israeli identification guide to Arab fleets and concluded the ship was the Egyptian supply ship ''El Quseir'', based on observing its deckline, midship bridge and smokestack.

[[File:USS Liberty (AGTR-5) turns while under attack by Israeli motor torpedo boats, 8 June 1967 (USN 1123754).jpg|thumb|''Liberty'' turns to evade Israeli torpedo boats]]

As the torpedo boats rapidly approached, Captain McGonagle ordered a sailor to proceed to machine gun Mount 51 and open fire.&lt;ref name=USNCOIreport/&gt;{{rp|38}}  However, he noticed that the boats appeared to be flying an Israeli flag, and "realized that there was a possibility of the aircraft having been Israeli and the attack had been conducted in error".&lt;ref name=USNCOIreport/&gt;{{rp|39}}  Captain McGonagle ordered the man at gun mount 51 to hold fire, but a short burst was fired at the torpedo boats before the man was able to understand the order.&lt;ref name=USNCOIreport/&gt;{{rp|39}}  McGonagle observed that machine gun Mount 53 began firing at the center torpedo boat at about the same time gun mount 51 fired, and that its fire was "extremely effective and blanketed the area and the center torpedo boat".&lt;ref name=USNCOIreport/&gt;{{rp|39}} Machine gun mount 53 was located on the starboard amidships side, behind the pilot house.&lt;ref name=USNCOIreport/&gt;{{rp|16}}  McGonagle could not see or "get to mount 53 from the starboard wing of the bridge".&lt;ref name=USNCOIreport/&gt;{{rp|39}} So, he "sent Mr. Lucas around the port side of the bridge, around to the skylights, to see if he could tell [Seaman] Quintero, whom [he] believed to be the gunner on Machine gun 53, to hold fire".&lt;ref name=USNCOIreport/&gt;{{rp|39}}

Ensign Lucas "reported back in a few minutes in effect that he saw no one at mount 53".&lt;ref name=USNCOIreport/&gt;{{rp|39}} Lucas, who had left the command bridge during the air attack and returned to assist Captain McGonagle immediately before a torpedo hit the ship,&lt;ref name=USNCOIreport/&gt;{{rp|14}} believed that the gunfire sound was likely from ammunition [[cooking off]], due to a nearby fire.&lt;ref name=USNCOIreport/&gt;{{rp|16}}  Prior to this time, after a torpedo hit the ship, Lucas had granted a request from Quintero to fire at the torpedo boats before heat from a nearby fire chased him from gun mount 53.&lt;ref name=USNCOIreport/&gt;{{rp|26,27}}  (McGonagle later testified, at the Court of Inquiry, that this was likely the "extremely effective" firing event he had observed.&lt;ref name=USNCOIreport/&gt;{{rp|49}})

After coming under fire, the torpedo boats returned fire with their cannons, killing ''Liberty's'' helmsman.&lt;ref name="Gerhard 1981 29"/&gt; The torpedo boats then launched five torpedoes at the ''Liberty''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|IDF History Report|1982|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 1235Z (2:35 local time)&lt;ref name="Gerhard 1981 29"/&gt; a torpedo hit ''Liberty'' on the [[starboard]] side forward of the superstructure, creating a {{convert|40|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide hole in what had been a former cargo hold converted to the ship's research spaces and killing 25 servicemen, almost all of them from the intelligence section, and wounding dozens.&lt;ref name="Oren"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/wlmcgon.htm|title=William Loren McGonagle, Captain, United States Navy|work=arlingtoncemetery.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been said the torpedo hit a major hull frame that absorbed much of the energy; crew members reported that if the torpedo had missed the frame the ''Liberty'' would have split in two. The other four torpedoes missed the ship.

The torpedo boats then closed in and [[strafe]]d the ship's hull with their cannons and machine guns.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} According to some crewmen, the torpedo boats fired at damage control parties and sailors preparing life rafts for launch. (See [[#Details in dispute|disputed details below]].) A life raft which floated from the ship was picked up by T-203 and found to bear US Navy markings. T-204 then circled ''Liberty'', and Oren spotted the designation GTR-5, but saw no flag.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} It took until 3:30&amp;nbsp;pm to establish the ship's identity. Shortly before the ''Liberty''{{'}}s identity was confirmed, the ''Saratoga'' launched eight aircraft armed with conventional weapons towards ''Liberty''. After the ship's identity was confirmed, the General Staff was notified and an apology was sent to naval attaché Castle. The aircraft approaching ''Liberty'' were recalled to the ''Saratoga''.&lt;ref name="Oren"/&gt;

===Aftermath of the attack===
[[File:USS Liberty (AGTR-5) with USS Little Rock (CLG-4) 1967.jpg|thumb|The 6th Fleet [[flagship]], {{USS|Little Rock|CLG-4|6}} standing by ''Liberty'']]
According to transcripts of intercepted radio communications, published by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), at about 2:30&amp;nbsp;pm, near the beginning of the torpedo boat attack, two IAF helicopters were dispatched to ''Liberty''{{'}}s location. The helicopters arrived at about 3:10&amp;nbsp;pm, about 35 minutes after a torpedo hit the ship. After arriving, one of the helicopter pilots was asked, by his ground-based controller, to verify that the ship was flying an American flag. The helicopters conducted a brief search for crew members of the ship who may have fallen overboard during the air attack. No one was found. The helicopters left the ship at about 3:20&amp;nbsp;pm.

At about 4&amp;nbsp;pm, two hours after the attack began, Israel informed the U.S. embassy in [[Tel Aviv]] that its military forces had mistakenly attacked a U.S. Navy ship. When the ship was "confirmed to be American" the torpedo boats returned at about 4:40&amp;nbsp;pm to offer help;&lt;ref name=IDFRRIR9&gt;{{harvnb|IDF Ram Ron Report|1967|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was refused by the ''Liberty''. Later, Israel provided a helicopter to fly U.S. naval attaché Commander Castle to the ship.&lt;ref name=NSAhistory&gt;{{cite web |title=NSA History Report |url=http://www.nsa.gov/liberty/liber00010.pdf |format=PDF |ref={{harvid|NSA History Report}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; (pp.&amp;nbsp;32,34)

In Washington, President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] had received word from the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] that ''Liberty'' had been torpedoed by an unknown vessel at 9:50&amp;nbsp;am eastern time. Johnson assumed that the Soviets were involved, and hotlined Moscow with news of the attack and the dispatch of jets from ''Saratoga''. He chose not to make any public statements and delegated this task to [[Phil G. Goulding]], who was an Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dod.mil/pubs/foi/operation_and_plans/USS_Liberty_Pueblo_Stark/607.pdf Public Affairs in the USS LIBERTY Incident.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130713013349/http://www.dod.mil/pubs/foi/operation_and_plans/USS_Liberty_Pueblo_Stark/607.pdf |date=13 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon afterward, the Israelis said that they had mistakenly attacked the ship. The Johnson administration conveyed "strong dismay" to Israeli ambassador [[Avraham Harman]]. Meanwhile, apologies were soon sent by Israeli Prime Minister [[Levi Eshkol]], Foreign Minister [[Abba Eban]], and [[chargé d'affaires]] Efraim Evron. Within 48 hours, Israel offered to compensate the victims and their families.{{sfn|Oren|2000}}

Though ''Liberty'' was severely damaged, with a 39&amp;nbsp;ft wide by 24&amp;nbsp;ft high (12 m x 7.3 m) hole and a twisted keel, her crew kept her afloat, and she was able to leave the area under her own power. ''Liberty'' was later met by the destroyers [[USS Davis (DD-937)|USS ''Davis'']] and [[USS Massey (DD-778)|USS ''Massey'']], and the cruiser [[USS Little Rock (CL-92)|USS ''Little Rock'']]. Medical personnel were transferred to ''Liberty'', and she was escorted to [[Malta]], where she was given interim repairs. After these were completed in July 1967, ''Liberty'' returned to the U.S. She was decommissioned in June 1968 and struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register]]. ''Liberty'' was transferred to [[United States Maritime Administration]] (MARAD) in December 1970 and sold for scrap in 1973.

From the start, the response to Israeli statements of mistaken identity ranged between frank disbelief and unquestioning acceptance within the administration in Washington. A communication to the Israeli Ambassador on 10 June, by Secretary Rusk stated, among other things: {{quote|At the time of the attack, the USS ''Liberty'' was flying the American flag and its identification was clearly indicated in large white letters and numerals on its hull. ... Experience demonstrates that both the flag and the identification number of the vessel were readily visible from the air ... Accordingly, there is every reason to believe that the ''USS Liberty'' was identified, or at least her nationality determined, by Israeli aircraft approximately one hour before the attack. ... The subsequent attack by the torpedo boats, substantially after the vessel was or should have been identified by Israeli military forces, manifests the same reckless disregard for human life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diplomatic Note From Secretary of State Rusk to the Israeli Ambassador|url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v19/d352|website=US Department of State: Office of the Historian|publisher=US Government|accessdate=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lenczowski|1990|p=111}} citing {{harvnb|Ennes|1987|p=285|loc=appendix S}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[George Lenczowski]] notes: "It was significant that, in contrast to his secretary of state, [[Lyndon B. Johnson|President Johnson]] fully accepted the Israeli version of the tragic incident." He notes that Johnson himself only included one small paragraph about the ''Liberty'' in his autobiography,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Lyndon Baines|authorlink=Lyndon B.

Lenczowski further states: "It seems Johnson was more interested in avoiding a possible confrontation with the Soviet Union, ... than in restraining Israel."{{sfn|Lenczowski|1990|p=110–112}}

==Investigations of the attack==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2017}}

===U.S. government investigations===
[[File:AGTR-5 torpedo damage 8Jun67.jpg|thumb|Torpedo damage to ''Liberty''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s research compartment ([[Starboard]] side)]]

American inquiries, memoranda, records of testimony, and various reports involving or mentioning the ''Liberty'' attack include, but are not limited to, the following:
* [http://www.thelibertyincident.com/docs/CourtOfInquiry.pdf U.S. Naval Court of Inquiry] of June 1967
* [http://www.thelibertyincident.com/docs/JCSreport.pdf Joint Chief of Staff's Report] of June 1967.
* [http://www.thelibertyincident.com/docs/CIAreports.pdf CIA Intelligence Memorandums] of June 1967
* [http://www.thelibertyincident.com/clifford.html Clark Clifford Report] of July 1967

* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090924012118/http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/declass/uss_liberty/ The NSA History Report] of 1981

The U.S. Naval Court of Inquiry record contains testimony by fourteen ''Liberty'' crew members and five subject matter experts; exhibits of attack damage photographs, various messages and memoranda; and findings of fact. The court concluded that the testimony record revealed "a shallow investigation, plagued by myriad disagreements between the captain and his crew".&lt;ref name=JamesScottBookp183&gt;{{harvnb|Scott|2009|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; As to [[culpability]], the court said "It was not the responsibility of the court to rule on the culpability of the attackers, and no evidence was heard from the attacking nation", the court concluded that "available evidence combines to indicate ... (that the attack was) a case of mistaken identity." Additionally, the Court found that "heroism displayed by the Commanding Officer, officers and men of the ''Liberty'' was exceptional."

The Joint Chief of Staff's Report contains findings of fact related only to communication system failures associated with the ''Liberty'' attack. It was not concerned with matters of culpability, nor does it contain statements thereof.

The CIA Memoranda consist of two documents: one dated June 13, 1967, and the other dated June 21, 1967. Someone said the June 13 memorandum is an "account of circumstances of the attack ... compiled from all available sources".{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} The June 21 memorandum is a point-by-point analysis of Israeli inquiry findings of fact. It concludes: "The attack was not made in malice toward the U.S. and was by mistake, but the failure of the IDF Headquarters and the attacking aircraft to identify the ''Liberty'' and the subsequent attack by torpedo boats were both incongruous and indicative of gross negligence."

The [[Clark Clifford]] Report consists of a review of "all available information on the subject" and "deals with the question of Israeli culpability", according to its transmittal memorandum. The report concludes: "The unprovoked attack on the ''Liberty'' constitutes a flagrant act of gross negligence for which the Israeli Government should be held completely responsible, and the Israeli military personnel involved should be punished."

The Senate Foreign Relations Committee Testimony contains, as an aside matter during hearings concerning a foreign aid authorization bill, questions and statements from several senators and responses from then [[Secretary of Defense]], [[Robert McNamara]], about the ''Liberty'' attack. For the most part, the senators were dismayed about the attack, as expressed by Senator [[Bourke B. Hickenlooper]]: "From what I have read I can't tolerate for one minute that this [attack] was an accident." Also, there was concern about obtaining more information about the attack, as expressed by Committee chairman [[J. William Fulbright]]: "We asked for [the attack investigation report] about two weeks ago and have not received it yet from Secretary Rusk. ... By the time we get to it we will be on some other subject." Secretary McNamara promised fast delivery of the investigation report (" ... &amp;nbsp;you will have it in four hours."), and concluded his remarks by saying: "I simply want to emphasize that the investigative report does not show any evidence of a conscious intent to attack a U.S. vessel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title=S.1872 A Bill to Amend the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 |publisher=Committee on Foreign Relations, United States Senate |date=12 June 1967 |url=http://www.thelibertyincident.com/docs/SenateInvestigation.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[House Armed Services Committee]] investigation report is titled, "Review of Department of Defense Worldwide Communications". It was not an investigation focused on the ''Liberty'' attack; although, the committee's report contains a section that describes communications flow involved with the ''Liberty'' incident.

The NSA History Report is, as its name connotes, a historical report that cited the U.S. Naval Court of Inquiry record, various military and government messages and memorandum, and personal interviews for its content. The report ends with a section entitled, "Unanswered Questions", and provides no conclusion regarding culpability.

The ''Liberty'' Veterans Association (composed of veterans from the ship) states that U.S. congressional investigations and other U.S. investigations were not actually investigations into the attack, but rather reports using evidence only from the U.S. Navy Court of Inquiry, or investigations unrelated to culpability that involved issues such as communications. In their view, the U.S. Navy Court of Inquiry is the only actual investigation on the incident to date. They say it was hastily conducted, in only 10 days, even though the court's president, [[Isaac C. Kidd, Jr.|Rear Admiral Isaac Kidd]], said that it would take six months to conduct properly. The inquiry's [[terms of reference]] were limited to whether any shortcomings on the part of the Liberty's crew had contributed to the injuries and deaths that resulted from the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=U.S. Naval Court of Inquiry; USS Liberty |date=10 June 1967 |publisher=USS ''Liberty'' Memorial |url=http://www.ussliberty.com/nci.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Navy Court of Inquiry's record of proceedings, four days were spent hearing testimony: two days for fourteen survivors of the attack and several U.S. Navy expert witnesses, and two partial days for two expert U.S. Navy witnesses. No testimony was heard from Israeli personnel involved.

The [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] in [[College Park, Maryland]] includes in its files on casualties from the ''Liberty'' copies of the original telegrams the Navy sent out to family members. The telegrams called the attack accidental. The telegrams were sent out June 9, the day before the Navy Court of Inquiry convened.

===Israeli government investigations===
Two subsequent Israeli inquiry reports and a historical report concluded the attack was conducted because ''Liberty'' was confused with an Egyptian vessel and because of failures in communications between Israel and the U.S. The three Israeli reports were:
* Fact Finding Inquiry by Colonel Ram Ron ("Ram Ron Report"—June 1967)&lt;ref name=IDFRRIR&gt;{{harvnb|IDF Ram Ron Report|1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Preliminary Inquiry (Hearing) by Examining Judge [[Yeshayahu Yerushalmi]] ("Yerushalmi Report"—July 1967)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thelibertyincident.com/docs/israeli/yerushalmi-report-en.pdf |title=Yerushalmi Report |format=PDF |accessdate=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Adjudication of IDF negligence [[complaint]]s.)
* Historical Report "The ''Liberty'' Incident"—[[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] History Department Report (1982)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|IDF History Report|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the historical report, it was acknowledged that IDF naval headquarters knew at least three hours before the attack that the ship was "an electromagnetic audio-surveillance ship of the U.S. Navy" but concluded that this information had simply "gotten lost, never passed along to the ground controllers who directed the air attack nor to the crews of the three Israeli torpedo boats."

The Israeli government said that three crucial errors were made: the refreshing of the status board (removing the ship's classification as American, so that the later shift did not see it identified), the erroneous identification of the ship as an Egyptian vessel, and the lack of notification from the returning aircraft informing Israeli headquarters of markings on the front of the hull (markings that would not be found on an Egyptian ship). As a common root of these problems, Israel blamed the combination of alarm and fatigue experienced by the Israeli forces at that point of the war when pilots were severely overworked.

After conducting his own fact-finding inquiry and reviewing evidence, Judge Yerushalmi's decision was: "I have not discovered any deviation from the standard of reasonable conduct which would justify committal of anyone for trial." In other words, he found no negligence by any IDF member associated with the attack.

==Ongoing controversy and unresolved questions==
Some intelligence and military officials dispute Israel's explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtonreport.me/2003-july-august/navy-captain-other-officials-call-for-investigation-of-israel-s-attack-on-uss-liberty.html |title=Navy Captain, Other Officials Call For Investigation Of Israel's Attack On USS Liberty |publisher=[[Washington Report on Middle East Affairs]] |first=Delinda C. |last=Hanley |date=July–August 2003 |pages=42, 53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dean Rusk]], U.S. Secretary of State at the time of the incident, wrote:

{{quote|text=I was never satisfied with the Israeli explanation. Their sustained attack to disable and sink ''Liberty'' precluded an assault by accident or some trigger-happy local commander.

Retired naval [[Lieutenant Commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]] [[James Ennes]], a [[junior officer]] (and off-going [[Officer of the Deck]]) on ''Liberty''{{'}}s bridge at the time of the attack, authored a book titled ''Assault on the Liberty'' describing the incident during the [[Six-Day War]] in June 1967 and saying, among other things, that the attack was deliberate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ennes|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ennes and [[Joe Meadors]], also survivors of the attack, run a website about the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gtr5.com/ |title=USS ''Liberty'' Memorial |publisher=Gtr5.com |date=8 June 1967 |accessdate=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meadors states that the classification of the attack as deliberate is the official policy of the [[USS Liberty Veterans Association|USS ''Liberty'' Veterans Association]],&lt;ref name="usslibertyveterans.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usslibertyveterans.org/ |title=USS ''Liberty'' Veterans Association |publisher=Usslibertyveterans.org |accessdate=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; to which survivors and other former crew members belong. Other survivors run several additional websites. Citing Ennes's book, Lenczowski notes: ''Liberty''{{'}}s personnel received firm orders not to say anything to anybody about the attack, and the naval inquiry was conducted in such a way as to earn it the name of "coverup".{{sfn|Lenczowski|1990|p=110–112}}

In 2002, Captain [[Ward Boston]], JAGC, U.S. Navy, senior counsel for the Court of Inquiry, said that the Court of Inquiry's findings were intended to cover up what was a deliberate attack by Israel on a ship that the Israelis knew to be American. In 2004, in response to the publication of [[A. Jay Cristol]]'s book ''The Liberty Incident'', which Boston said was an "insidious attempt to whitewash the facts", Boston prepared and signed an affidavit in which he said that Admiral Kidd had told him that the government ordered Kidd to falsely report that the attack was a mistake, and that Boston and Kidd both believed the attack was deliberate.&lt;ref name="WRMEA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtonreport.me/2004-march/declaration-of-ward-boston-jr.-captain-jagc-usn-ret.html |title=Declaration of Ward Boston, Jr., Captain, JAGC, USN (Ret.) |publisher=Washington Report on Middle East Affairs |date=March 2004 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the issue Boston wrote, in part:

{{quote|text=The evidence was clear. Both Admiral Kidd and I believed with certainty that this attack, which killed 34 American sailors and injured 172 others, was a deliberate effort to sink an American ship and murder its entire crew. Each evening, after hearing testimony all day, we often spoke our private thoughts concerning what we had seen and heard. I recall Admiral Kidd repeatedly referring to the Israeli forces responsible for the attack as 'murderous bastards'. It was our shared belief, based on the documentary evidence and testimony we received first hand, that the Israeli attack was planned and deliberate, and could not possibly have been an accident.}}

Cristol wrote about Boston's professional qualifications and integrity, on page 149 of his book:

{{quote|text=Boston brought two special assets in addition to his skill as a Navy lawyer. He had been a naval aviator in World War II and therefore had insight beyond that of one qualified only in the law. Also, Kidd knew him as a man of integrity. On an earlier matter Boston had been willing to bump heads with Kidd when Boston felt it was more important to do the right thing than to curry favor with the senior who would write his fitness report.|author=A. Jay Cristol |source=The Liberty Incident}}

Cristol said he believes that Boston is not telling the truth about Kidd's views and any pressure from the U.S. government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Boston, Ward - Affidavit |date=22 October 2003 |publisher=The ''Liberty'' Incident |url=http://www.thelibertyincident.com/docs/boston-comments.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cristol, who also served as an officer of the U.S. Navy's Judge Advocate General, suggests that Boston was responsible in part for the original conclusions of the Court of Inquiry and, that by later declaring that they were false, Boston has admitted to "lying under oath". Cristol also notes that Boston's statements about pressure on Kidd were hearsay, and that Kidd was not alive to confirm or deny them. He also notes that Boston did not maintain, prior to his affidavit and comments related to it, that Kidd spoke of such instructions to Boston or to others. Finally, Cristol provides a handwritten 1991 letter from Admiral Kidd&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thelibertyincident.com/docs/Kidd.pdf |title=Letter to Cristol from Admiral Isaac C. Kidd, Jr |publisher=The ''Liberty'' Incident |date=3 August 1991 |accessdate=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; that, according to Cristol, "suggest that Ward Boston has either a faulty memory or a vivid imagination".

The [[Anti-Defamation League]] supports Cristol's opinion:
{{quote|text= ... according to his own account, Boston's evidence of a cover-up derives not from his own part in the investigation but solely on alleged conversations with Admiral Kidd, who purportedly told him he was forced to find that the attack was unintentional. Kidd died in 1999 and there is no way to verify Boston's statements. However, Cristol argues that the 'documentary record' strongly indicated that Kidd 'supported the validity of the findings of the Court of Inquiry to his dying day.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/Israel/uss.asp The USS ''Liberty'' Attack], [[Anti-Defamation League]], June 9, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to James Ennes, however, Admiral Kidd urged Ennes and his group to keep pressing for an open congressional probe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=David C. |last=Walsh |title=Friendless Fire? |publisher=[[United States Naval Institute]] |work=[[Proceedings (magazine)|Proceedings]] |date=June 2003 |volume=129 |issue=6/1,204 |url=https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2003-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following arguments, found in official reports or other sources, were published to support that the attack was due to mistaken identity:
* Accidents and mistakes do occur in wartime. Journalist [[Ze'ev Schiff]] gave an example of a [[friendly fire]] incident where Israeli aircraft had bombed an Israeli armored column south of the West Bank town of [[Jenin]] the day before the attack on the ''Liberty''.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsh Goodman and [[Ze'ev Schiff]], "The Attack on the Liberty," ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'', September 1984&lt;/ref&gt;
* The incident took place during the [[Six-Day War]] when Israel was engaged in battles with two Arab countries and preparing to attack a third, creating an environment where mistakes and confusion were prevalent. For example, at 11:45, a few hours before the attack, there was a large explosion on the shores of El-Arish followed by black smoke, probably caused by the destruction of an ammunition dump by retreating Egyptian forces. The Israeli army thought the area was being bombarded, and that an unidentified ship offshore was responsible. (According to U.S. sources, ''Liberty'' was {{convert|14|nmi|mi km|abbr=on}} from those shores at the time of the explosion.)
* As the torpedo boats rapidly approached, ''Liberty'' opened fire on them. This was after the aerial attacks. At the inquiry, Commander McGonagle expressed that the torpedo boats appeared to be approaching in an attack formation. Thus, he sent a person to the forward machine gun to fire at them. After several shots were fired, McGonagle ordered cease fire. Then a machine gun on 03 level sounded like it was firing, but nobody was seen at the gun. McGonagle said that he felt sure the torpedo boat captains believed they were under fire from the ''Liberty''. Ensign Lucas, the ship's gunnery officer who left the bridge shortly after the beginning of the air attack and then returned during the torpedo boat attack, testified that he gave permission for manned firing of the 03 level machine gun after the torpedo boats began firing at ''Liberty''. Then, later when the gun was unmanned, heat from a nearby fire apparently caused machine gun rounds at the 03 level gun to explode.&lt;ref name=USNCOIreport /&gt;
* Admiral Shlomo Erell, former head of the Israeli Navy in 1967, states that no successful argument of benefit has been presented for Israel purposely attacking an American warship, especially considering the high cost of predictable complications that would follow after attacking a powerful ally, and the fact that Israel notified the American embassy immediately after the attack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/features/shlomo_erell_interview.shtml Dead in the Water] [[BBC]] Interview with Former Head Israeli Navy 1967, Admiral Shlomo Erell&lt;/ref&gt;

Several books and the BBC documentary ''USS ''Liberty'': Dead in the Water'' argued that ''Liberty'' was attacked in order to prevent the U.S. from knowing about the forthcoming attack in the [[Golan Heights]], which would violate a cease-fire to which Israel's government had agreed.&lt;ref&gt;http://daccessdds.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/240/87/IMG/NR024087.pdf  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327062036/http://daccessdds.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/240/87/IMG/NR024087.pdf |date=27 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Syria did not accept the cease fire until 9 June, after the attack on ''Liberty.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wellens |first=Karen |author2=T.M.C.

Lenczowski notes that while the Israeli decision to "attack and destroy" the ship "may appear puzzling", the explanation seems to be found in ''Liberty''{{'}}s nature and its task to monitor communications on both sides in the war zone. He writes, "Israel clearly did not want the U.S. government to know too much about its dispositions for attacking Syria, initially planned for 8 June, but postponed for 24 hours. It should be pointed out that the attack on ''Liberty'' occurred on 8 June, whereas on 9 June at 3&amp;nbsp;am, Syria announced its acceptance of the cease-fire. Despite this, at 7&amp;nbsp;am, that is, four hours later, Israel's minister of defense, [[Moshe Dayan]], "gave the order to go into action against Syria".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lenczowski|1990|pp=105–115}}, Citing {{cite book|last=Dayan|first=Moshe|author-link=Moshe Dayan|title=Moshe Dayan: Story of My Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c53WAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PP1|year=1992|publisher=Da Capo|isbn=978-0-306-80497-7}}; and {{cite book|last=Safran|first=Nadav|authorlink=Nadav Safran|title=From War to War: The Arab-Israeli Confrontation 1948 - 1967; a Study of the Conflict from the Perspective of Coercion in the Context of Inter-Arab and Big Power Relations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=63S5DAEACAAJ&amp;pg=PA375|year=1969|publisher=Pegasus|page=375}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further writes that timely knowledge of this decision and preparatory moves toward it "might have frustrated Israeli designs for the conquest of Syria's Golan Heights" and, in the sense of Ennes's accusations, provides "a plausible thesis that Israel deliberately decided to incapacitate the signals-collecting American ship and leave no one alive to tell the story of the attack."{{sfn|Lenczowski|1990|p=105–115}}

U.S. Ambassador to Israel, Barbour, had reported on the day of the ''Liberty'' attack that he "would not be surprised" by an Israeli attack on Syria, and the IDF Intelligence chief told a White House aide then in Israel that "there still remained the Syria problem and perhaps it would be necessary to give Syria a blow."&lt;ref&gt;LBJ, National Security File, Box 104/107, Middle East Crisis: Jerusalem to the Secretary of State, 8 June 1967; Barbour to Department, 8 June 1967; Joint Embassy Memorandum, 8 June 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1981 book ''Weapons'' by Russell Warren Howe says that ''Liberty'' was accompanied by the [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris ballistic missile]]-armed [[Lafayette class submarine|''Lafayette''-class submarine]] {{USS|Andrew Jackson|SSBN-619|6}}, which filmed the entire episode through its periscope but was unable to provide assistance. According to Howe: "Two hundred feet below the ship, on a parallel course, was its 'shadow'—the Polaris strategic submarine ''Andrew Jackson'', whose job was to take out all the Israeli long-range missile sites in the Negev if Tel Aviv decided to attack Cairo, Damascus or Baghdad. This was in order that Moscow would not have to perform this task itself and thus trigger World War Three."{{efn|Several ''Liberty'' crew members testified that they had briefly seen a periscope during the attack. In 1988, the Lyndon Johnson Library declassified and released a document from the ''Liberty'' archive with the "Top Secret—Eyes Only" security caveat (Document #12C sanitized and released 21DEC88 under review case 86–199). This "Memorandum for the Record" dated 10 April 1967 reported a briefing of the "303 Committee" by General Ralph D. Steakley. According to the memo, General Steakley "briefed the committee on a sensitive DOD project known as FRONTLET 615," which is identified in a handwritten note on the original memorandum as "submarine within U.A.R. waters". Further Freedom of Information Act requests returned no existence of a project called "FRONTLET 615". In February 1997, a senior member of the crew of the submarine {{USS|Amberjack|SS-522|6}} told James Ennes that he had watched the attack through the periscope and took pictures. According to the official ship's history from the Department of Defense, ''Amberjack''{{'}}s mission between 23 April and 24 July was reconnaissance within U.A.R. When contacted, four crewmen stated that they were so close to ''Liberty'' when it came under attack that some of the crew believed ''Amberjack'' itself was under depth charge attack. August Hubal, Captain of the ''Amberjack'', insists that the vessel was {{convert|100|mi|km|abbr=on}} from the ''Liberty'' and when told the crew believed they were closer replied "They must be mistaken". On 2 July 2003, as a result of a lawsuit using the Freedom of Information Act by Joel Leyden on behalf of the Israel News Agency requesting any evidence that the U.S. submarine ''Amberjack'' had gathered by means of its periscope, the National Security Agency stated that there had been "no radio intercepts made by the U.S. submarine ''Amberjack''". James Ennes believes that if the submarine photography exists, it should show that the ship's flag was clearly visible to the attacking fighters and torpedo boats.}}

[[James Bamford]], a former [[ABC News]] producer, in his 2001 book ''Body of Secrets'',&lt;ref name="Excerpt"&gt;[http://hnn.us/articles/191.html Excerpt] from ''Body of Secrets'' by James Bamford.&lt;/ref&gt; says Israel deliberately attacked ''Liberty'' to prevent the discovery of what he described as war crimes, including the killing of Egyptian prisoners of war by the IDF that he alleges was taking place around the same time in the nearby town of [[El-Arish]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://fas.org/sgp/eprint/bamford.html Memo] from James Bamford regarding criticism of his charges.&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to [[Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America|CAMERA]], his claim that 400 were executed has been cast into doubt since reporters present in the town claimed that there had in fact been a large battle and this was the main cause of casualties.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', 8 June 1967&lt;/ref&gt; Bamford also claimed that eyewitness Gabi Bron had claimed he saw 150 people executed by Israeli troops at [[El-Arish]].&lt;ref name="Excerpt"/&gt; However, Gabi Bron claimed to have only seen 5 people executed by Israeli troops.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'' article by Serge Schmemann, 21 August 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.camera.org/index.asp?x_article=181&amp;x_context=7 Bamford Bashes Israel] CAMERA&lt;/ref&gt;

The press release for the BBC documentary film ''Dead in the Water'' states that new recorded and other evidence suggests the attack was a "daring ploy by Israel to fake an Egyptian attack" to give America a reason to enter the war against Egypt. Convinced that the attack was real, President of the United States [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] launched allegedly nuclear-armed aircraft targeted against Cairo from a U.S. aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean. The aircraft were recalled only just in time, when it was clear the ''Liberty'' had not sunk and that Israel had carried out the attack. An information source for the aircraft being nuclear-armed, James Ennes, later stated:

{{quote| text=Although ''America'' could not send conventionally armed jets, reports still come in that four jet bombers were catapulted from the carrier ''America'' with nuclear bombs aboard. Even today there is no official confirmation of that launch and much high-level denial. A nuclear launch has been strongly denied by Secretary McNamara, Admiral Martin (now deceased), Admiral Geis (deceased), Admiral Moorer, and ''America'''s skipper, Admiral [[Donald D. Engen|David Engen]] (deceased) and others. Yet eyewitness reports persist. Clearly no such launch could have been intended for offensive purposes. Surely nuclear weapons would not have been used in defense of the USS Liberty.

It is clear that I was mistaken about the aircraft involved, as F4s do not carry nuclear weapons. Others tell me that the aircraft that were launched carried [[AGM-12 Bullpup|Bullpup missiles]], which might easily be mistaken for nuclear bombs. And we learned much later that the USS ''America'' was involved in a nuclear weapons loading drill at the very time the ship learned of the attack on the Liberty and that this drill is one factor that delayed America's response to our call for help. It is also possible that those were the weapons seen by our sources.

Also confusing this issue is an oral history report from the American Embassy in Cairo, now in the LBJ Library, which notes that the Embassy received an urgent message from Washington warning that Cairo was about to be bombed by US forces, presumably in mistaken retaliation for the USS Liberty attack. That strange message was never explained or cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ussliberty.org/addendum.htm Addendum to 2007 Edition], online statement, June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The video also provides hearsay evidence of a covert alliance of U.S. and Israel intelligence agencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2002/06_june/08/uss_liberty.shtml "New evidence for American cover-up of Israeli attack on U.S. warship"], [[BBC]], 6 August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Admiral [[Thomas Hinman Moorer|Thomas H. Moorer]], former [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] and a critic of the official United States Government version of events, chaired a non-governmental investigation into the attack on the ''Liberty'' in 2003. The committee, which included former U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia [[James E. Akins]], held Israel to be culpable and suggested several theories for Israel's possible motives, including the desire to blame Egypt and bring the U.S. into the Six-Day War.&lt;ref name=ap2003-10-23&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,100960,00.html |title=Ex-Navy Official: 1967 Israeli Attack on U.S. Ship Was Deliberate |accessdate=16 November 2008 |date=23 October 2003 |agency=Associated Press |publisher=Fox News Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[John Loftus (author)|John Loftus]] and [[Mark Aarons]] in their book, ''The Secret War Against the Jews'', ''Liberty'' was attacked because the Israelis knew that the ship's mission was to monitor radio signals from Israeli troops and pass troop movement information to the Egyptians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Loftus |first1=John |authorlink1=John Loftus (author) |last2=Aarons |first2=Mark |authorlink2=Mark Aarons |title=The Secret War Against the Jews: How Western Espionage Betrayed The Jewish People |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=trU7nY-T-4EC&amp;pg=PA281 |year=1994 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |isbn=978-0-312-15648-0 |page=281}}{{Unreliable source?|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NSA tapes and subsequent developments==
Within an hour of learning that the ''Liberty'' had been torpedoed, the director of the U.S. [[National Security Agency]], LTG [[Marshall Carter|Marshall S. Carter]], sent a message to all intercept sites requesting a special search of all communications that might reflect the attack or reaction. No communications were available. However, one of the airborne platforms, a U.S. Navy [[EC-121 Warning Star|EC-121]] aircraft that flew near the attacks from 2:30&amp;nbsp;pm to 3:27&amp;nbsp;pm, Sinai time (1230 to 1327 [[Coordinated Universal Time|Z]]), had collected voice conversations between two Israeli helicopter pilots and the control tower at Hatzor Airfield following the attack on the ''Liberty''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Possible Reflections of Israeli Attack Against USS Liberty |publisher=National Security Agency |url=http://www.nsa.gov/liberty/liber00007.pdf |date=8 June 1967 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704174443/http://www.nsa.gov/liberty/liber00007.pdf |archivedate=4 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 July 2003, the NSA released copies of the recordings made by the EC-121 and the resultant translations and summaries.&lt;ref name="NSA Liberty"&gt;{{cite web |title=U.S.S.

Two linguists who were aboard the EC-121 when the recordings were made, however, said separately that at least two additional tapes were made that have been excluded from the NSA releases up to and including a 8 June 2007 release.&lt;ref name=trib /&gt;

The helicopters arrived near the ship at about 1303Z: "I see a big vessel, near it are three small vessels ... "  At 1308Z, Hatzor air control indicated concern about the nationality of the ship's crew: "The first matter to clarify is to find out what their nationality is."  At 1310Z, one of the helicopter pilots asked the nearby torpedo boats' Division Commander about the meaning of the ship's hull number: "GTR5 is written on it. Does this mean something?"  The response was: "Negative, it doesn't mean anything."  At 1312Z, one of the helicopter pilots was asked by air control: "Did you clearly identify an American flag?"  No answer appears in the transcript, but the air controller then says: "We request that you make another pass and check once more if this is really an American flag."  Again, no response appears in the transcript. At about 1314Z, the helicopters were directed to return home.

The NSA reported that there had been no radio intercepts of the attack made by the ''Liberty'' herself, nor had there been any radio intercepts made by the U.S. submarine {{USS|Amberjack|SS-522|6}}.

On 10 October 2003, ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'' ran an interview with [[Yiftah Spector]], one of the pilots who participated in the attack,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&amp;cid=1065773796483&lt;/ref&gt; and thought to be the lead pilot of the first wave of aircraft. Spector said the ship was assumed to be Egyptian, stating that: "I circled it twice and it did not fire on me. My assumption was that it was likely to open fire at me and nevertheless I slowed down and I looked and there was positively no flag." The interview also contains the transcripts of the Israeli communications about the ''Liberty''. The journalist who transcribed the tapes for that article, [[Arieh O'Sullivan]], later confirmed that "the Israeli Air Force tapes he listened to contained blank spaces."&lt;ref name=trib /&gt;

The ''Liberty''{{'}}s survivors contradict Spector. According to subsequently declassified NSA documents: "Every official interview of numerous ''Liberty'' crewmen gave consistent evidence that indeed the ''Liberty'' was flying an American flag—and, further, the weather conditions were ideal to ensure its easy observance and identification."{{sfn|Gerhard|Millington|1981|pages=41, 49, footnote 4}}

On 8 June 2005, the USS ''Liberty'' Veterans Association filed a "Report of War Crimes Committed Against the U.S. Military, June 8, 1967" with the Department of Defense (DoD). They say [http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/html/231101.htm Department of Defense Directive 2311.01E] requires the Department of Defense to conduct a thorough investigation of the allegations contained in their report. DoD has responded that a new investigation will not be conducted since a Navy Court of Inquiry already investigated the facts and circumstances surrounding the attack.

As of 2006, the NSA has yet to declassify "boxes and boxes" of ''Liberty'' documents. Numerous requests under both declassification directives and the Freedom of Information Act are pending in various agencies including the NSA, [[Central Intelligence Agency]], and [[Defense Intelligence Agency]]. "On 8 June 2007, the National Security Agency released hundreds of additional declassified documents
on the Israeli attack on the USS ''Liberty'', a communications interception vessel, on 8 June 1967."&lt;ref name="NSA Liberty"/&gt;

On 2 October 2007, ''The [[Chicago Tribune]]'' published a special report&lt;ref name=trib /&gt; into the attack, containing numerous previously unreported quotes from former military personnel with first-hand knowledge of the incident. Many of these quotes directly contradict the NSA's position that it never intercepted the communications of the attacking Israeli pilots, saying that not only did transcripts of those communications exist, but also that it showed the Israelis knew they were attacking an American naval vessel.

Two diplomatic cables written by [[Avraham Harman]], Israel's ambassador in Washington, to [[Abba Eban]], Israel's [[minister of foreign affairs]], have been declassified by Israel and obtained from the [[Israel State Archive]]. The first cable, sent five days after the attack, informs Eban that a U.S. informant told him (Harman) that there was "clear proof that from a certain stage the pilot discovered the identity of the ship and continued the attack anyway."&lt;ref name="JamesScottBookp197"/&gt; The second cable, sent three days later, added that the White House is "very angry" because "the Americans probably have findings showing that our pilots indeed knew that the ship was American."&lt;ref name=trib /&gt;

Documents of the Israeli General Staff meetings, declassified in October 2008, show no discussion of a planned attack on an American ship.&lt;ref name=amiroren&gt;{{Cite news| last = Oren| first = Amir| title = War from the bottom up| work = Haaretz| accessdate = 29 November 2008| date = 30 October 2008| url = http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1030925.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 October 2014, [[Al Jazeera English]] broadcast a documentary film containing recent first-hand accounts by several survivors of the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/specialseries/2014/10/day-israel-attacked-america-20141028144946266462.html |title=The Day Israel Attacked America |work=[[Al Jazeera English]] |date=3 October 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031063453/http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/specialseries/2014/10/day-israel-attacked-america-20141028144946266462.html |archivedate=31 October 2014 |accessdate=8 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The documentary argues that Israel knew the ship was American, and planned to blame its sinking on Egypt in order to draw the US into the war on the Israeli side.

==Details in dispute==
[[File:USS Liberty second ensign 2.jpg|thumb|The "Second Ensign" flown during the attack. Israel Defense Forces' investigative reports say their pilots and torpedo boat commander saw no flags during the attack.]]

Many of the events surrounding the attack are the subject of controversy:
* ''Visibility of American flag:'' The official Israeli reports say that the reconnaissance and fighter aircraft pilots, and the torpedo boat captains did not see any flag on ''Liberty''. Official American reports say that the ''Liberty'' was flying her American flag before, during and after the attack; the only exception being a brief period in which one flag had been shot down and then replaced with a larger flag that measured approximately {{convert|13|ft|m|abbr=on}} long. U.S. Naval Court of Inquiry finding number 2 states: "The calm conditions and slow speed of the ship may well have made the American flag difficult to identify." And finding number 28 states: "Flat, calm conditions and the slow five knot patrol speed of LIBERTY in forenoon when she was being looked over initially may well have produced insufficient wind for streaming colors enough to be seen by pilots".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thelibertyincident.com/docs/CourtOfInquiry.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The NSA History Report (page 41) states: " ... &amp;nbsp;every official interview of numerous Liberty crewmen gave consistent evidence that indeed the Liberty was flying an American flag—and, further, the weather conditions were ideal to ensure its easy observance and identification."
* ''U.S. crewmen's perceptions of intent:'' Surviving crewmembers of the ''Liberty'' say that Israel's attack on the ship was "deliberate" and with full knowledge that the vessel was American. Israeli investigation and history reports agree that the attack was deliberate—but against what they believed was an Egyptian enemy vessel, not an American neutral vessel.

[[File:EmiraFauzia.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An [[auxiliary ship]] of the Egyptian Navy]]
* ''Distinctiveness of USS Liberty's appearance:'' One major dispute is whether the ''Liberty'' would have been immediately recognized as a different ship from the Egyptian ship ''El Quseir''. Admiral Tom Moorer stated that the ''Liberty'' was the most identifiable ship in the U.S. Navy and in an interview with the ''[[Washington Post]]'' stated: "To suggest that they [the IDF] couldn't identify the ship is ... ridiculous. Anybody who could not identify the ''Liberty'' could not tell the difference between the White House and the Washington Monument." Israel states in its inquiry and history reports that the identification as the ''El Quseir'' was made by the torpedo boats while the ''Liberty'' was enveloped in smoke and was based on "The Red Book", a guide to Arab fleets that did not include U.S. vessels.([http://usslibertyinquiry.googlepages.com/essay3 Web site with images of both ships])
* ''Identification markings:'' ''Liberty'' bore an eight-foot-high "5" and a four-foot-high "GTR" along either bow, clearly indicating her hull (or "pennant") number (AGTR-5), and had {{convert|18|in|mm|adj=on}}-high letters spelling the vessel's name across the [[stern]]. These markings were not cursive [[Arabic script]] but in the [[Latin alphabet]]. Israeli pilots say initially they were primarily concerned with ensuring the ship was a non-Israeli warship and that they ended the air attack when they noticed the Latin alphabet markings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/liberty.html|title=The USS ''Liberty''|publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |accessdate=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Ship's identification known during attack:'' A [[James Bamford]] book,&lt;ref&gt;''Body of Secrets'', by James Bamford, Doubleday, 2001 ({{ISBN|0-09-942774-5}})&lt;/ref&gt; published in 2001, said that secret NSA intercepts recorded by an American EC-121 reconnaissance aircraft indicate that Israeli pilots had full knowledge they were attacking a U.S. vessel.&lt;ref name="archives.cnn.com"/&gt; This 2001 proposition has played a significant role in the ongoing controversies about the incident, and continues to be widely cited. The tapes were later released by the National Security Agency in 2003 as a result of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit brought by Judge and author A. Jay Cristol. However, instead of the EC-121 attack tapes requested by the FOIA request, the tapes released contained post-attack communications of Israeli helicopter pilots, their ground controller, and someone on one of the torpedo boats. The helicopters were sent to the attack site to provide assistance after the air attack. The helicopter pilots noticed an American flag flying from the ship almost immediately upon their arrival at the attack site&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/07/09/uss.liberty.tapes/index.html | publisher=CNN |title=USS ''Liberty'' attack tapes released |date=9 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and informed their controller. See [[USS Liberty incident#Other sources|other sources]] for a link to the [[NSA]] website with complete transcripts. The NSA website denies that there are any U.S. recordings of the attack itself; although, this is disputed by several intelligence specialists who say they read the original transcripts.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}
* ''Effort for identification:'' The American crew says the attacking aircraft did not make identification runs over ''Liberty'', but rather began to strafe immediately. Israel says several identification passes were made. The Naval Court of Enquiry, based on the Israeli timeline of events, found "One may infer from the fact that within a period of approximately 15 minutes, the request was transmitted (for aircraft to be dispatched), received, a command decision made, aircraft dispatched, and the attack launched, that no significant time was expended in an effort to identify the ship from the air before the attack was launched."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelibertyincident.com/docs/SalansMemo.pdf Salans Memo pdf Salans Report] 21 September 1967&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Speed of the vessel:'' According to Israeli accounts, the torpedo boat made (admittedly erroneous) measurements that indicated the ship was steaming at {{convert|30|kn|mph km/h|lk=in|abbr=on}}. Israeli naval doctrine at the time required that a ship traveling at that speed must be presumed to be a warship. A second boat calculated ''Liberty''{{'}}s speed to be {{convert|28|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}}. The maximum sustained speed of ''Liberty'' was only {{convert|17.5|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}}, {{convert|21|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}} being attainable by overriding the engine governors. According to ''Body of Secrets'', by James Bamford, ''Liberty'' crewmen (including the Officer-of-the-Deck) and the Court of Enquiry findings the ship was steaming at {{convert|5|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}} at the time of the attack.

[[File:Cdr. McGonagle in his cabin on board USS Liberty, June 1967.jpg|thumb|Commander W.L. McGonagle in his damaged cabin after the attack]]
* ''Motive:'' James Bamford, among others, says one possible motive was to prevent the United States from eavesdropping on Israeli military activities and monitoring the events taking place in nearby Gaza.&lt;ref name="archives.cnn.com"&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/04/23/liberty.attack Israel's 1967 attack on U.S. ship deliberate, book says] [[CNN]], 23 April 2001&lt;/ref&gt; In a study of the incident concluding that there was insufficient evidence to support either accidental or deliberate attack, Colonel Peyton E. Smith wrote of the possibility that "The attack was most likely deliberate for reasons far too sensitive to be disclosed by the US (or) Israeli government and that the truth may never be known".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gtr5.com/commentary/Report%20-%20ArmyWarCollege1.pdf Assault on the USS Liberty: Deliberate Action or Tragic Accident] Colonel Peyton E. Smith 30 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Author and former crew member James M. Ennes theorized, in the epilogue of his book ''Assault on the Liberty'', that the motive was to prevent the ship's crew from monitoring radio traffic that might reveal Israel being the aggressor in its impending invasion of Syria, which the White House opposed. According to the [[Anti Defamation League]] "the argument that Israel knowingly attacked an American ship has always lacked a convincing motive".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/israel/uss.asp The USS ''Liberty'' Attack] [[Anti Defamation League]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Israeli aircraft markings:'' The USS ''Liberty'' Veterans Association says that the attacking Israeli aircraft were not marked,&lt;ref name="usslibertyveterans.org"/&gt; but a crewmember recalls watching a Jewish officer cry on seeing the blue Star of David on their fuselages.&lt;ref name="trib"/&gt; The torpedo boats that attacked ''Liberty'' did fly the flag of Israel.&lt;ref name="Gerhard 1981 29"/&gt;
* ''Jamming:'' During U.S. Naval Court of Inquiry testimony, Wayne L. Smith, Radioman Chief, testified: " ... &amp;nbsp;We did have [radio frequency] jamming in my estimation. I was unable to determine this exactly, but every time it seems when an attack was made on us, or a strafing run, it was preceded by, anywhere from 25 to 30 seconds, carrier on our HICOM circuit, and I had ascertained to check this by calling the transmitter room and they said that they had not keyed the transmitter. This prevailed during the attack and quite a bit after the attack, intermittently." In a U.S. Navy message dated 11 July 1967, sent by Rear Admiral Kidd (senior member of Naval Court of Inquiry) via the Naval Communications Unit, Naples, Italy to Commander in Chief U.S. Navy Europe and Chief Naval Operations, Rear Admiral Kidd stated, in part: "''Liberty'' reported apparent discriminate jamming on certain CW and voice circuits just before and during each aircraft's individual attack. Effect was to scare mischief out of those below who heard it start, because they knew a rocket or bomb would soon follow." None of the Israeli Defense Forces' investigations or reports confirm or deny radio frequency jamming was performed during or following the attack.
* ''Jamming as a motive:'' A [[UPI]] report published by ''[[The Washington Star]]'' on 19 September 1977 indicated CIA documents obtained by the American Palestine Committee suggested Israeli defense minister Moshe Dayan ordered the attack because ''Liberty'' was jamming Israeli communications. A CIA document dated 23 June 1967 said ''Liberty'' had been jamming Israeli communications. Another CIA document dated 9 November 1967 quoted unidentified agency informants as saying Dayan personally ordered the attack. CIA said the documents were "unevaluated for accuracy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |date=December 1977 |title=New Light on the ''Liberty'' |journal=[[Proceedings (magazine)|Proceedings]] |volume=103 |issue=12 |page=108 |publisher=[[United States Naval Institute]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Visual communications:'' Joe Meadors, the signalman on bridge, states that "Immediately prior to the torpedo attack, he was on the Signal Bridge repeatedly sending 'USS ''Liberty'' U.S. Navy Ship' by flashing light to the torpedo boats." The Israeli boats say they sent the signal "AA" (general call) for which the formal reply would be TTTT later followed by both vessels sending identification codes. Commander Moshe Oren says he thought ''Liberty'' signaled AA in reply, which was the same reply he received from the Egyptian destroyer ''[[Ibrahim el Awal]]'' eleven years earlier. Oren then consulted "The Red Book" (identification of Arabian navies) noting that the only match for the "old tub" with one funnel and two masts was the ''El Quseir''. Meadors says he never sent "AA".&lt;ref&gt;''The ''Liberty'' Incident'' A. Jay Cristol p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Israeli ships' actions after the torpedo hit:'' Officers and men of ''Liberty'' say that after the torpedo attack and the abandon ship order, motor torpedo boats strafed the ship's topside with automatic gunfire preventing men from escaping from below, and either machine-gunned or confiscated the empty life rafts that had been set afloat.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ennes|1987|pp=95,96}}

* ''Israeli offers of help:'' The ''Liberty''{{'}}s captain, several of the ''Liberty''{{'}}s crewmen and the Israelis stated that help was offered, but at different times. The ''Liberty''{{'}}s Deck Log, signed by the captain, has an entry at 15:03 stating: "One MTB returned to the ship and signaled, 'Do you need help.' Commanding officer directed that 'Negative' be sent in reply." The captain testified before the Court of Inquiry, on page 40 of recorded testimony: "One of the boats signaled by flashing light, in English, 'do you require assistance?' We had no means to communicate with the boat by light but hoisted code lima india. The signal intended to convey the fact that the ship was maneuvering with difficulty and that they should keep clear." Ensign David G. Lucas, First Lieutenant and Gunnery Officer testified in the Court of Inquiry on page 17 that: "another patrol craft approached us from the starboard side and did manage to get clear of the smoke. The signalman took the message, 'do you need help?'". Harold Jessie Thompson, Chief Communications Technician testified in the court of inquiry on page 88 that: "When they were about 500 yards off, the torpedo boat turned astern and came up on the stern on the starboard side and flashed, 'do you need help?'". James Ennes, in his book about the attack, on pages 102 and 103, acknowledges the Israelis offered help, says it occurred at 16:30, and the offer was rejected. The Israel Defense Forces's History Report about the attack and the Ram Ron report both say that help was offered at 16:40 and the offer was rejected.&lt;ref name="IDF History Report 1982 19"/&gt;&lt;ref name=IDFRRIR9/&gt;
* ''U.S. rescue attempts:'' At least two rescue attempts were launched from U.S. [[aircraft carrier]]s nearby but were recalled, according to the ''Liberty''{{'}}s senior Naval Security Group officer, Lieutenant Commander David Lewis. Lewis made an [http://home.roadrunner.com/~gidusko/liberty/lewis_ra.htm audio recording] and later [http://home.earthlink.net/~donpageler/Controversey.html wrote] about a meeting 6th Fleet Rear Admiral Lawrence Geis requested in his cabins: "He told me that since I was the senior ''Liberty'' survivor on board he wanted to tell me in confidence what had actually transpired. He told me that upon receipt of our [[SOS]], aircraft were launched to come to our assistance and then Washington was notified. He said that the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] ([[Robert McNamara]]) had ordered that the aircraft be returned to the carrier, which was done. RADM Geis then said that he speculated that Washington may have suspected that the aircraft carried nuclear weapons so he put together another flight of conventional aircraft that had no capability of carrying nuclear weapons. These he launched to assist us and again notified Washington of his actions. Again McNamara ordered the aircraft recalled. He requested confirmation of the order being unable to believe that Washington would let us sink. This time President Johnson ordered the recall with the comment that he did not care if every man drowned and the ship sank, but that he would not embarrass his allies. This is, to the best of my ability, what I recall transpiring 30 years ago."

[[File:X2010 music compo.jpg|thumb|The music competition at X2010]]
'''X''' is a Dutch [[demoscene]] party which started in 1995 in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], [[The Netherlands]] organized by Success &amp; The Ruling Company, Xenon and Silicon Ltd.

X is the successor of the Silicon Ltd. Winter and Summer parties which were held between 1990 and 1992. With about 250 visitors, it is the world's biggest [[Commodore 64]] demoscene-party, attracting [[demosceners]] from not only [[The Netherlands]], but also from other European countries (e.g. [[Sweden]], [[Finland]], [[Poland]], [[Germany]]), or even from overseas (for example [[Australia]], [[United States]]).

== History ==

The concept of the X parties was born somewhere in 1995 when the members of the [[Commodore 64]] [[demogroup]] Silicon Ltd. started the PC demogroup SuccesS.
The plan was to organize a [[demoparty]] for the Commodore 64 and the PC demoscene.
The party place was decided to be Buurthuis Einsteindreef in the city of Utrecht, The Netherlands; the same place where the Silicon Ltd. parties were held in the past.

The first two parties were held in Buurthuis Einsteindreef which were sponsored by soundcard developer [[Advanced Gravis Computer Technology|Gravis]]. In 1996 it was clear the location was too small to hold the number of visitors and their hardware.
In 1997 the X organizers teamed up with the Dutch PC demogroup Nostalgia who had connections with the [[Technical University]] of [[Eindhoven]], hence the next party baptised as X 97 Takeover which took place in the [[auditorium]] of the [[Technical University]] [[Eindhoven]].
Due to quarrels between the party organizers, this was the first and only party organized by SuccesS and Nostalgia.

The group SuccesS retired from the demoscene in 1998, which caused their Commodore 64 counterparts in Success &amp; The Ruling Company to carry on with the X parties but now as a Commodore 64 only party.
Also the party location changed. Since 1998 the X party is held at Kampeerboerderij De Haverkamp in [[Ruurlo]], The Netherlands.

In the year of 2000 the Dutch demogroup Xenon was added as organizing group and in 2006 Silicon Ltd. was added too after more than 10 years of scene absence.

In 2010 the party was held in a new and bigger location in Someren. The Demo competition in 2010 were won by Offence, a Norwegian demo-group returning to the 8-bit platform after 19 years of no demo creation.

The '''''Zeitgeist''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|z|aɪ|t|ɡ|aɪ|s|t}},&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/zeitgeist oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com]&lt;/ref&gt; [[German language|German]] pronunciation {{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|s|aɪ|t|ɡ|aɪ|s|t}} {{Audio|De-zeitgeist.ogg|Zeitgeist}}) is a concept from 18th- to 19th-century [[German philosophy]], translated as "spirit of the age" or "spirit of the times". It refers to an invisible agent or force dominating the characteristics of a given epoch in [[world history]].&lt;ref&gt;Theo Jung: [https://freidok.uni-freiburg.de/data/9343 "Zeitgeist im langen 18. Jahrhundert. Dimensionen eines umstrittenen Begriffs"], in: Achim Landwehr (ed.): ''Frühe Neue Zeiten. Zeitwissen zwischen Reformation und Revolution'', Bielefeld 2012, 319-355; idem: [https://freidok.uni-freiburg.de/data/10824 "The Politics of Time: Zeitgeist in Early Nineteenth-Century Political Discourse"], in: Contributions to the History of Concepts 9, Nr. 1 (2014), 24-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is now mostly associated with [[Hegel]], contrasting with Hegel's use of ''[[Volksgeist]]'' "national spirit" and ''[[Weltgeist]]'' "world-spirit", 
but its coinage and popularization precedes Hegel, and is mostly due to [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]] and [[Goethe]].&lt;ref&gt;''Zeitgeist'' "spirit of the epoch" and ''Nationalgeist'' "spirit of a nation" in L. Meister, ''Eine kurze Geschichte der Menschenrechte'' (1789).
''der frivole Welt- und Zeitgeist'' ("the frivolous spirit of the world and the time") in [[Lavater]], ''Handbibliothek für Freunde'' 5 (1791), p. 57.
''Zeitgeist'' is popularized by [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]] and [[Goethe]].

Contemporary use of the term may, more pragmatically, refer to a schema of [[fad|fashions or fads]] which prescribes what is considered to be acceptable or tasteful for an era, e.g. in the field of [[architecture]].&lt;ref name=StF&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yvqZt9ZnmYUC&amp;printsec=frontcover |author=Eero Saarinen |title=Shaping the Future |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-972-48812-9 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=yvqZt9ZnmYUC&amp;pg=PA15 15]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hegel==
{{see|Phenomenology of the Spirit|Weltgeist|Volksgeist|Hegelianism}}
Hegel in ''[[Phenomenology of the Spirit]]'' (1807) uses both ''Weltgeist'' and ''Volksgeist'' but prefers the phrase ''Geist der Zeiten'' "spirit of the times" over the [[German compound|compound]] ''Zeitgeist''.&lt;ref&gt;
c.f. use of the phrase {{lang|de|der Geist seiner Zeit}} ("the spirit of his time") in  ''[[Lectures on the Philosophy of History]]'', for example, "no man can surpass his own time, for the spirit of his time is also his own spirit." {{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=khvwPJMzNzMC&amp;printsec=frontcover |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=khvwPJMzNzMC&amp;pg=PA262&amp;dq=Zeitgeist |title=The Hegel Dictionary |author=Glenn Alexander Magee |publisher=[[A &amp; C Black]] |location=London |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-847-06591-9 &lt;!--|ISBN=1-84706591-0 --&gt;|chapter=Zeitgeist (p. 262)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hegelian concept does not necessarily contrast with the [[Great Man theory]] as by [[Thomas Carlyle]], which sees history as the result of the actions of heroes and geniuses, as Hegel perceived such "great men", specifically [[Napoleon]], as the "embodiment of the world-spirit" (''Die Weltseele zu Pferde'' "the world-soul on horseback"&lt;ref&gt; Hegel, letter of  13 October 1806  to F. I. Niethammer,  no. 74 (p. 119) in ''Briefe von und an Hegel'' ed. Hoffmeister, vol. 1 (1970). 
See also H. Schnädelbach in Wolfgang Welsch, Klaus Vieweg (eds.), ''Das Interesse des Denkens: Hegel aus heutiger Sicht'', 
Wilhelm Fink Verlag (2003), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=NrkPdUO5VRsC&amp;pg=PA233  p. 223], 
T. Pinkard, '' Hegel: A Biography'', (2000), p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;)

Hegel believed that art reflected, by its very nature, the culture of the time in which it is created. Culture and art are inextricable because an individual artist is a product of his or her time and therefore brings that culture to any given work of art. Furthermore, he believed that in the modern world it was impossible to produce classical art, which he believed represented a "free and ethical culture", which depended more on the [[Aesthetics|philosophy of art]] and [[Art#Art theories|theory of art]], rather than a reflection of the social construct, or ''Zeitgeist'' in which a given artist lives.&lt;ref&gt;Hendrix, John Shannon. ''Aesthetics &amp; The Philosophy Of Spirit''. New York: Peter Lang. (2005). 4, 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In self-help and business models==
{{undue|date=March 2018}}
===Theory of leadership===
A "zeitgeist theory of [[leadership]]" has been  contrasted with [[Thomas Carlyle|Thomas Carlyle’s]] [[great man theory]] by Forsyth (2009).&lt;ref name="Forsyth, D. R. 2009"&gt;Forsyth, D. R. (2009). Group dynamics: New York: Wadsworth. [Chapter 9]&lt;/ref&gt; In his theory, Carlyle stresses that leaders do not become leaders by fate or accident. Instead, these individuals possess characteristics of great leaders and these characteristics allow them to obtain positions of power.

According to Forsyth,  [[Leo Tolstoy]] disagreed with Carlyle’s perspective, 
instead believing that leadership, like other things,  was a product of the "zeitgeist",{{year needed|date=March 2018}}{{page needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;!--are we claiming Tolstoy used the term (when? where?) or are we just saying that Forsyth idly mentions Tolstoy and Zeitgeist alongside one another?--&gt;  the social circumstances at the time.&lt;ref name="Forsyth, D. R. 2009"/&gt; 

[[Great man theory]] and zeitgeist theory can be included in two main areas of thought in [[psychology]].&lt;ref name="Forsyth, D. R. 2009"/&gt; For instance, [[great man theory]] is very similar to the [[Trait theory|trait approach]]. Trait researchers are interested in identifying the various personality traits that underline human behaviors such as conformity, leadership or other social behaviors. Thus, they agree that leadership is primarily a quality of an individual and that some people are pre-dispositioned to be a leader whereas others are born to follow these leaders. In contrast, [[Situationism (psychology)|situationist]] researchers believe that social behavior is a product of society. That is, social influence is what determines human behaviors. Therefore, [[Situationism (psychology)|situationism]] is of the same opinion as zeitgeist theory—leaders are created from the social environment and are molded from the situation. The concept of zeitgeist also relates to the sociological tradition that stems from [[Émile Durkheim]] and recently developed into [[social capital]] theory as exemplified by the work of [[Patrick Hunout]].

These two perspectives have been combined to create what is known as the ''interactional'' approach to [[leadership]].&lt;ref name="Forsyth, D. R. 2009"/&gt; This approach asserts that leadership is developed through the mixing of personality traits and the situation. Further, this approach was expressed by social psychologist, [[Kurt Lewin]], by the equation B = f(P, E) where behavior (B) is a function (f) of the person (P) and the environment (E).

===Examples of models in business===
Executives, venture capitalists, journalists and authors have argued that the idea of a zeitgeist is useful in understanding the emergence of industries, simultaneous invention and evaluating the relative value of innovations. [[Malcolm Gladwell]] argued in his book ''[[Outliers (book)|Outliers]]'' that entrepreneurs who succeeded often share similar characteristics—early personal or significant exposure to knowledge and skills in the early stages of a nascent industry. He proposed that the timing of involvement in an industry and often in sports as well affected the probability of success. In [[Silicon Valley]], a number of people ([[Peter Thiel]], Alistair Davidson, Mac Levchin, [[Nicholas G. Carr]], [[Vinod Khosla]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/view/428526/silicon-valleys-trouble-with-innovation/|title=Silicon Valley's Trouble with Innovation|work=MIT Technology Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;) have argued that much innovation has been shaped by easy access to the Internet, [[open source software]], component technologies for both hardware and software (e.g., software libraries, [[software as a service]]), and the ability to reach narrow markets across a global market. Peter Thiel has commented: "There is so much [[incrementalism]] now."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://topics.bloomberg.com/peter-thiel/|title=Peter Thiel|work=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a zeitgeist market, the number of new entrants is high, differentiation in high value products (the strongest predictor of new product success) is more difficult to achieve, and [[business model]]s emphasizing service and solution over product and process will enhance success. Examples include innovation in product experience, legal rights and bundling, privacy rights, and agency (where businesses act on behalf of customers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/qa/428186/max-levchin/|title=Max Levchin|work=MIT Technology Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304141204577508820786062502|title=Why Modern Innovation Traffics in Trifles - WSJ|author=Nicholas Carr|date=6 July 2012|work=WSJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/13/khosla-the-silicon-valley-vision/|title= Vinod Khosla: Maintain the Silicon Valley Vision|author= Vinod Khosla	|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eclicktick.com/innovationzeitgeist/|title=The Book - Innovation Zeitgeist|work=eclicktick.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intellectual fashion==
{{synthesis|date=March 2018}}
{{See also|Multiple discovery}}
''Zeitgeist'' in the sense intellectual or aesthetic [[fashion]] or [[fad]]:

* Research from [[Experimental aesthetics|empirical aesthetics]] investigated the relation between zeitgeist as temporal context and the evaluation of [[Creativity|creative]] works. In a study of the musical originality of 15,618 classical [[Theme (music)|music themes]], the importance of objective characteristics and zeitgeist for popularity was examined. Both the musical originality of a theme relative to its contemporary works (the zeitgeist), as well as its "absolute" originality influenced in similar [[Effect size|magnitude]] the popularity of a theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simonton|first=Dean K.|date=1980|title=Thematic fame, melodic originality, and musical zeitgeist: A biographical and transhistorical content analysis.|url=http://content.apa.org/journals/psp/38/6/972|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|language=en|volume=38|issue=6|pages=972–983|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.38.6.972|issn=0022-3514}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, objective features and temporal context both influenced the evaluation of linguistic originality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Form|first=Sven|date=2018-01-30|title=Reaching Wuthering Heights with Brave New Words: The Influence of Originality of Words on the Success of Outstanding Best-Sellers|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/jocb.230|journal=The Journal of Creative Behavior|language=en|doi=10.1002/jocb.230|issn=0022-0175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Errors of illusion are not readily apparent because the shared beliefs and assumptions of a particular era that support them come from the zeitgeist. An example can be seen with [[Henry H. Goddard]] and [[Lewis Terman]]. The consensus in the 20th century was that existing psychology tests adequately measured basic intelligence in diverse groups of people. The more recent consensus is that "culture-fair" tests need to be developed - which may or may not be true. But because of the zeitgeist, in those times, the cross-cultural validity of existing tests was not questioned.&lt;ref name="Hothersall"&gt;Hothersall, D., "History of Psychology", 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
* Failure to question research findings that agree with prevailing political and philosophical ideology represents one of the effects of the zeitgeist.&lt;ref name="Hothersall"/&gt;
* The zeitgeist does not always have negative effects. It can stimulate new ideas and creative solutions to problems. An example is seen in the different models and metaphors chosen to describe behavior and consciousness.&lt;ref name="Hothersall"/&gt;
* [[Charles Darwin]]'s proposition that [[evolution]] occurs by [[natural selection]] has been cited as a case of the zeitgeist, since his contemporary, [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], was outlining similar models to Darwin during the same period (ideas that were jointly presented to the public).&lt;ref name="Hothersall"/&gt; This view is disputed, however, by accounts that emphasize the relative simplicity of Wallace's model, and which highlight a supposed novelty within Darwin's likewise simplistic contribution.&lt;ref name="Bowler"&gt;Bowler, Peter J., ''The Non-Darwinian Revolution'' (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The zeitgeist of the 1920s revolved around [[logical positivism]]. Due to this, the great men and women of that time were able to impact psychology, such as Watson, Tolman, and Guthrie. This is important because their work on behavioral psychology was able to work against eugenics. Before this time behavioral psychology was not able to impact the field since it did not fit with the spirit of the times. For example, Twitmyer [[Edwin B. Twitmyer]] wrote a paper on the patellar reflex in 1902, but it came too early to have the impact it deserved.&lt;ref name="Hothersall"/&gt;
* [[B F Skinner]] being unseated during the cognitive revolution is another example of the zeitgeist in psychology. The zeitgeist was changing during this time, people wanted to show more interest in humans, and more people were becoming interested in personality psychology. However, in the 1950s his new experimental approach to psychology using inductive reasoning and descriptive behaviorism was seen as novel and practical. Especially in contrast with psychoanalysts, whose assertions and interpretations were largely immune to rigorous, empirical inquiry, thus making validation a rather problematic task.&lt;ref name="Hothersall"/&gt;
