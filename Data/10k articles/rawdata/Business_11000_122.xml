      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3462">The '''Annual Georgia European Union Summit''' ('''AGEUS''') is a yearly gathering of Georgian and international economic development leaders.

The '''[[Beijing]] [[Central Business District]]''', or '''Beijing CBD''' ({{zh|s=北京商务中心区|t=北京商務中心區|p=Běijīng Shāngwù Zhōngxīn Qū}}), is the primary area for [[finance]], [[Mass media|media]], and business services in [[Beijing]], [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;Latimer D. (2014) ''The Improbable Beijing Guidebook'', Sinomaps, Beijing, {{ISBN|978-7-5031-8451-2}}, p.76&lt;/ref&gt;

Beijing CBD occupies 3.99&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of the [[Chaoyang District, Beijing|Chaoyang District]] on the east side of the city. Geographically situated to the east of the city center, sandwiched between the [[3rd Ring Road (Beijing)|3rd Ring Road]] and the [[4th Ring Road]], the Beijing CBD is currently undergoing large-scale development.

==Economic history and importance==
As Beijing is becoming one of the most important [[international financial center]]s in China, Beijing CBD was recently positioned as the secondary core area in Beijing's International Financial Center Development strategic plan published in May, 2008. Beijing CBD is also emerging as China's media center as [[Beijing Television]] Station (BTV) just moved in its new headquarters ([[Beijing TV Centre]]) in this area and the new [[CCTV Headquarters]] was officially opened on 15 June 2008 [[night]].

In the eight years since the government decided to speed up construction of the district, the Beijing CBD has attracted 117 Fortune 500 businesses in the financial, media, information technology, consulting and service industries. More than 60 percent of overseas-funded companies in Beijing are in the CBD. A majority of foreign embassies in Beijing - the No 1, No 2 and No 3 [[embassy]] districts are now concentrated in the Beijing CBD and its neighboring areas.

The Beijing CBD Administrative Committee, established in 2001, is in charge of planning and management and aims to facilitate investments and improve the work environment for professionals.The committee provides information to investors on laws, taxes and state policies as well as a one-stop service, which has simplified approval procedures and raised efficiency.

The establishment of the Beijing CBD Chamber of Finance, the Beijing CBD Chamber of Media Industry and Beijing CBD Association of Property Management &amp; Real Estate Development has facilitated communication and cooperation between the government and enterprises. The Beijing CBD International Business Festival and Beijing CBD International Forum have put the Beijing CBD on the map worldwide.

'''Business Link''' was a government-funded business advice and guidance service in England. It consisted of an online portal managed by [[HM Revenue and Customs]] (HMRC) and a national telephone helpline.

The network of local/regional advisors (under the auspices of the [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]]) was axed in 2011. The online portal was replaced (along with [[Directgov]]) by the [[GOV.UK|Gov.uk]] website on 17 October 2012, although the telephone helpline was retained.

This government programme is not to be confused with Business Link Magazine Group, a magazine publisher founded in 1988.

==Origins and launch==
The concept for Business Link was established in December 1992 by [[Michael Heseltine]], then President of the Board of Trade, when he was in charge of the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] and was initially referred to as "One Stop Shop".&lt;ref name="closure"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tyler|first1=Richard|title=Business Link scrapped and replaced by call centre|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/yourbusiness/8093448/Business-Link-scrapped-and-replaced-by-call-centre.html|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=5 March 2016|date=28 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time research for the Competitiveness Agenda led Government to believe small businesses were reluctant to invest in growth, that they failed to plan ahead and invest in training, that they were swamped with paperwork and relied on too few customers. These barriers to growth were the driving forces behind the need for a Business Link type solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forte|first=Elliot|title=Intervention: The Battle for Better Business|date=17 December 2011|publisher=Lulu|isbn=978-1447863236|pages=13–264|url=http://www.battleforbetterbusiness.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Enterprise Initiative ran from 1988 to 1994. This Government funded scheme was designed to encourage take of up external advice (consultancy) by small businesses. This initiative offered grant incentives for small businesses to use consultants. During this three-year period applications were received from 135,700 businesses.  A Wren and Storey report concluded that £1,000 of grant assistance increased sales in a business by £30,000 and created a new job. An alternative study by Bennett and Robson estimated that take up of external advice trebled in small businesses with the incentive of grant provision. The Enterprise Initiative compounded support for intervention in the small business market place.

"I knew that there were very large numbers of small and medium sized enterprises out there who were running on the most rudimentary systems. If they had a problem, many of them didn't come from a background where they knew of anyone who could help or advise them. We wanted a team of people who could hold their hand, listen to their problems, have a working knowledge of what business is about, make suggestions, ask questions and be a friend in need." Heseltine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forte|first=Elliot|title=Intervention: The Battle for Better Business|date=17 December 2011|publisher=Lulu|isbn=978-1447863236|pages=23–263|url=http://www.battleforbetterbusiness.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resistance===
Despite being a Conservative sponsored initiative with apparent cross party support, the proposal for a Government funded One Stop Shop immediately hit political resistance.

Reflecting on this period in 2011 Heseltine stated that "you would have the left wing, which wouldn't have any real interest in effective management of the capitalist system. And you would have a very powerful element on the right wing of politics that would think it's a matter for the capitalist system to manage itself and government intervention, as they would call it, would be very unattractive. In truth, when I did it, I did comprehensive presentations to Conservative back benchers so that they could see what I believed an industrial policy was about. What they felt it was likely to be about were things like backing winners, or subsidising losers. Now I wasn't in favour of certainly the latter, but once I had done the presentations, I had no complaints."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forte|first=Elliot|title=Intervention: The Battle for Better Business|date=17 December 2011|publisher=Lulul|isbn=978-1447863236|pages=254–264|url=http://www.battleforbetterbusiness.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially Heseltine approached the private sector to deliver a Business Link type service, specifically the [[British Chambers of Commerce]]. However, these meetings were unsuccessful. The reasons for this failure are disputed, however Heseltine stated that Chambers "should have set up this combined advisory service. They should have gone to Government and said, look you've got all these services, work with us and create the one stop shop. That's what they should have done. We did it for them. I think they regarded Business Link as an intrusion into their fiefdom. But the reason we created Business Link was because the Chambers weren't doing a good enough job. So there was tension there from the beginning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forte|first=Elliot|title=Intervention: The Battle for Better Business|date=17 December 2011|publisher=Lulul|isbn=978-1447863236|pages=252–264|url=http://www.battleforbetterbusiness.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Challenges creating the network===
The Department of Trade (DTI) predicted 54 Business Links would launch by the end of 1993. Progress was much slower than anticipated due to each bidder and proposal having to be evaluated by a National Assessment Panel. Achieving and maintaining the ISO 9001 Quality Management Standard and Investors in People was a mandatory requirement and each new organisation (Business Link Operator) who, if successful, was granted a three-year operating license. By the end of 1993 (during which time the government spent some £3m on the programme), only three branches of the service had been formed. The first opened in Leicester on 27 September 1993, with others following in Birmingham and [[Congleton]]. Halfway through 1994 only 21 Business Link Operators were in place.

At the end of 1996 the Government finally completed the national roll-out, establishing a total of 89 new Business Link partnerships overseeing 240 advice centres throughout England. Each week some 10,000 businesses in England were using the service.

===Market confusion===
The Business Link network initially employed 650 personal business [[Financial advisor|advisors]] (PBAs), who worked primarily with businesses that employed between 10 and 249 people (Small and Medium Sized Enterprises). In February 1996 the Institute of Directors published a research paper declaring that their members were worried about the declared focus on growth business employing between 10 and 249 persons, because this might hurt smaller businesses and disadvantage start ups. However, contrary to popular belief at the time, businesses of all sizes were able to access Business Link services from the start. In November 1996, Richard Page, the Minister for Small Business, Industry and Energy, stated in the House of Commons that he was "disturbed to hear that the impression has been given that we are not there to help all businesses irrespective of size. My clear message is that Business Link is there to help any business man or woman, irrespective of size of company, because from little acorns grow the big oak trees".

This contradiction may be explained by the DTI directive requiring the individual new Business Link partnerships to generate at least 25% of their income from outside central Government within five years of launch, with the express advice that the most likely source would be the end consumers. As a result, the Business Links wanted their PBAs to work with growth-oriented businesses but this proved difficult to enforce and implement.&lt;ref&gt;Mole, K. (2002) 'Street-Level Technocracy in UK Small Business Support: Business Links, Personal Business Advisers and the Small Business Service’. Environment and Planning C: Government and Policy, 20(2), 179–194&lt;/ref&gt; PBAs were recruited from those who ran businesses. At first some were self-employed earning commission but this did not prove to be self-sustaining.&lt;ref&gt;Priest, S.J. (1999). Business Link services to small and medium-sized enterprises: Targeting, innovation and charging. Environment and Planning C, 17, 177–93.&lt;/ref&gt; Early business support in Scotland was called Scottish Business Shop. In Wales the name was Business Connect, and in Northern Ireland it was called the Local Enterprise Development Unit.

==Services==
===Regional network===
Business Link’s face-to-face service operated on a [[Regions of England|regional]] basis across England and was funded by the relevant [[regional development agency|regional development agencies]] (RDAs). The service used an IDBT (information, diagnostic, brokerage and transaction) model to advise businesses. Regional Business Links ran a variety of events and workshops on topical issues and general business skills.

This service was evaluated on a number of occasions&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, R. J. and Robson, P. J. A. (1999) 'Intensity of Interaction in Supply of Business Advice and Client Impact: A Comparison of Consultancy, Business Associations and Government Support Initiatives for SMEs’. British Journal of Management 10 , 351–369. Bennett, R.J, Robson, P.J.A. and Bratton, W.J.A. (2001) Government advice networks for SMEs: An assessmsnt of the influence of local context on Business Link use, impact and satisfaction, Applied Economics, 33(7): 871–885. Mole, K.F., Hart, M., Roper, S., and Saal, D. (2008). Differential gains from Business Link Support and Advice: A treatment effects approach. Environment and Planning C: Government and Policy, 26, 315–34. Mole, K.F., Hart, M., Roper, S., and D. Saal. (2009). Assessing the Effectiveness of Business Support Services in England: Evidence from a Theory Based Evaluation. International Small Business Journal, 27, 557–582. Roper S, Hart, M, 2005 ‘Small Firm Growth And Public Policy In The UK: What Exactly are the Connections?’ Working Paper, Aston Business School (RP0504)&lt;/ref&gt;

These assessments generally found positive impacts of Business Link on companies that received advice. However, some commentators worried about the cost of Business Link and the variability of advice.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, R.J. and Robson P.J.A.. (2003) ‘Changing use of external business advice and Government support during the 1990s’. Regional Studies,  37, 795–811&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the Business Links were chosen to provide more intensive support to fewer companies and these seemed to do comparatively well. Other Business Links showed less success with a 'spreading the jam thinly model'&lt;ref&gt;Mole, K.F., Hart, M., Roper, S., and D. Saal. (2011)  Broader or Deeper? Exploring the most effective intervention profile for public small business support, Environment and Planning A vol. 43 no 1 pp 87 – 105&lt;/ref&gt;

The Business Link regional advisory service offered advice and support to businesses until November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Business Link|url=http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/aboutus|accessdate=30 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was then abolished along with the [[regional development agency|regional development agencies]] (RDAs). The Business Link website and the national helpline continued to operate. [[Local enterprise partnership]]s (LEPs) will be expected to drive regional economic growth in the absence of the Business Link regional advisory service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Department for Business Innovation and Skills, Local Enterprise Partnerships|url=http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/economic-development/leps|accessdate=30 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various business link companies have engaged in direct competition with the private sector and with Governmental organisations such as ACAS. This includes the provision of employment law advice directly to businesses via cold calling, mail shots, emails and their websites. However, evaluations of Business Link showed that those taking advice from Business Link were thereafter more likely to work with private consultants as they learned about the benefits of advice&lt;ref&gt;Mole K.F., Hart M., Roper S., and Saal D. (2009) "Assessing the Effectiveness of Business Support Services in England: Evidence from a Theory Based Evaluation" International Small Business Journal Vol 27, no. 5, pp. 557–582&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Website ===
[[File:Business Link website.png|thumb|The Business Link website in September 2012]]
The Business Link website was launched in May 2004 as part of the [[Transformational Government]] programme (an initiative to consolidate UK government websites). In 2010 it emerged that the site cost £35m a year to build and operate (totaling £105m so far).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= BBC|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/rorycellanjones/2010/07/the_105m_website.html|title=The £105m website}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was administered by the private company [[Serco]], on behalf of the government.

Information on the site came in the form of ''guides'' (pages of text information), ''interactive tools'' (in which businesses could get personalised information) and ''transactions'' (in which businesses could for example, calculate their VAT).

In 2010 the website launched an experimental wiki on some of the guides to allow visitors to add their own content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Experimental Wiki|url=http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?site=210&amp;itemId=1085516912&amp;type=ONEOFFPAGE|accessdate=27 July 2010}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This experiment ran until the end of September 2010.

==Closure==
Despite the evidence that it was the advisers who contributed to the impact of Business Link,&lt;ref&gt;Mole, K.F., Hart, M., Roper, S., Saal.D.  (2009). Assessing the Effectiveness of Business Support Services in England: Evidence from a Theory Based Evaluation. International Small Business Journal, 27, 557–582.
Mole, K.F., Hart, M., Roper, S.,  Saal, D. (2008). Differential gains from Business Link Support and Advice: A treatment effects approach. Environment and Planning C: Government and Policy, 26, 315–34.
&lt;/ref&gt; the Coalition government, elected in 2010, declared their intention to abolish the regional business adviser programs run by Business Link.&lt;ref name="closure" /&gt; New local enterprise partnerships would take their place but the national website and telephone service would continue.

The website was replaced by the [[Gov.uk]] public information website on 17 October 2012. Content was migrated to the new website, maintaining previous links to redirect users.

==Similar services==
Business Link only operated in England. The remainder of the UK still has similar regional services:

* [[Business Gateway]], Scotland&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bgateway.com |title=Business Link &amp;#124; Scottish Enterprise |publisher=Bgateway.com |date= |accessdate=21 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* NIbusinessinfo.co.uk, Northern Ireland (run by [[Invest Northern Ireland]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nibusinessinfo.co.uk |title=Business Link &amp;#124; investNI |publisher=Nibusinessinfo.co.uk |date= |accessdate=21 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Flexible Support for Business, Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fs4b.wales.gov.uk |title=Business support, information and advice &amp;#124; business.wales.gov.uk |publisher=Fs4b.wales.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=21 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regional providers used a rebranded version of the Business Link website. The Northern Ireland website has retained the vast majority of the Business Link website information.

Most OECD countries provide similar services although they may organise them differently. Examples are the SBDC in the USA and ALMI in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;Mole K and Bramley G. (2006) Making policy choices in non-financial business support: An International Comparison,  Environment and Planning C., 24, 6, 885–908&lt;/ref&gt;

Code § 1770&lt;/ref&gt;  Forbidden practices include misrepresenting the source of the good and services, representing reconditioned goods as new, advertising goods without having the expected demand in stock, representing a repair is needed when it is not, representing rebates that have hidden conditions, and misrepresenting the authority of a salesman to close a deal.  

The CLRA claim is attractive to potential [[plaintiff]]s because Cal. Civ. Code § 1780 allows consumers who suffer damage as a result of a practice declared unlawful by § 1770 to obtain actual [[damages]] (the total award of damages in a [[class action]] shall be more than $1,000); an order enjoining the methods, acts, or practices; restitution of property; [[punitive damages]]; court costs and attorney's fees; and any other relief that the court deems proper. A prevailing plaintiff gets to recover his attorney's fees, but a prevailing defendant usually may not recover his attorney's fees.&lt;ref&gt;Civil Code § 1780(e) only awards the defendant attorney's fees if the action was not in good faith.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carl Wilhelm Andreas Falck''' (27 May 1907 – 23 July 2016&lt;ref name="NorwayToday"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://norwaytoday.info/news/norways-oldest-man-dead/|title=Norway's oldest man is dead|last=Tatone|first=Joseph|date=25 July 2016|website=norwaytoday.info|publisher=Norway Today|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a Norwegian businessman, [[centenarian]], and Norway's oldest living man. He was head of the [[wholesale]]rs' organization Norges Grossistforbund from 1948 to 1975. At the age of 105, Falck became Norway's oldest man in 2012 and a subject of media interest.

==Early years and career==
Falck was born in [[Tønsberg]], South Norway to a bookseller and his wife. He got a master's degree in law (''[[cand.jur.]]'') in 1931 at the [[University of Oslo]] and subsequently held various positions as jurist in the [[Norwegian Police Service]], a deputy judge ({{lang-no|dommerfullmektig|links=no}}), assistant lawyer and as jurist in the [[Ministry of Social Affairs (Norway)|Ministry of Social Affairs]]. After 1939, he mostly worked within various business organisations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://runeberg.org/hvemerhvem/1973/0148.html "Hvem er Hvem?"    (1973), p. 148] Runeberg.org; retrieved 5 January 2014 {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, he was named CEO of the wholesalers' organization Norges Grossist-forbund, (which in 1990 was merged into the [[Federation of Norwegian Enterprises]]). In this position and as part of the [[Marshall Plan]], he spent two months in large cities in the US in 1952 to study the American wholesale industry. He became particularly interested in how the Americans kept stock in big one-level warehouses, as opposed to the Norwegian practice where stocks often were kept in narrow multilayer warehouses where ladders were needed to get the stocks in and out. Coming back to Norway, he advocated what he thought was the more effective American system. He published a book about structural changes in the wholesaler industry in 1969. He was a member of various Norwegian and European committees during his career.&lt;ref&gt;Marita E. Valvik (13 April 2013) [http://www.aftenposten.no/okonomi/Lagersjefen-Carl-Falck-7172836.html#.UsisULTeDIU "Lagersjefen Carl Falck"] ''[[Aftenposten]]''; retrieved 5 January 2014 {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elderly years and death==
In 2012, at age 105, Falck became Norway's oldest man and since then was portrayed by various media outlets. Remaining in good health, he lived in his own home until 2012. when he moved into a nursing home in Oslo. He used to smoke until he was around 50. In his eighties, he started going to a gym, and later worked out daily at the nursing home.&lt;ref&gt;Hilde Nordlund (24 August 2012) [http://www.dagbladet.no/2012/08/24/tema/helse/eldre/trening/velvere/23109764/ "Norges nest eldste mann synes damene på senteret er for gamle"] ''[[Dagbladet]]''.

He encouraged people to use their right to vote and declared he would vote the same party as he always had;&lt;ref name=falck/&gt; he voted for the 43rd time in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Astrid Johanne Karstensen (7 September 2013) [http://www.dagbladet.no/2013/09/07/magasinet/pluss/norges_eldste_mann/reportasjen/valg/29067889/ "Mandag stemmer Norges eldste mann, Carl Falck (106), på samme parti for 43. gang"] ''Dagbladet''; retrieved 5 January 2014 {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Fagan inspection''' is a process of trying to find [[wikt:defect|defects]] in documents (such as [[source code]] or formal specifications) during various phases of the [[software development process]]. It is named after Michael Fagan, who is credited{{by whom|date=November 2018}} with being the inventor of formal [[software inspection]]s.

Fagan inspection defines{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} a process as a certain activity with pre-specified entry and [[exit criteria]]. In every process for which entry and exit criteria are specified, Fagan inspections can be used to validate if the output of the process complies with the exit criteria specified for the process. Fagan inspection uses a group review method to evaluate the output of a given process.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

{{portal|Software Testing}}

== Examples ==
Examples of activities for which Fagan inspection can be used are:
* Requirement specification
* Software/Information System architecture (for example DYA{{huh|date=November 2018}}){{citation needed|date=November 2018}}
* Programming (for example for iterations in [[Extreme Programming|XP]] or [[Dynamic Systems Development Method|DSDM]])
* Software testing (for example when creating test scripts)

== Usage ==
The [[software development process]] is a typical application of Fagan inspection. As the costs to remedy a defect are up to 10 to 100 times less in the early operations compared to fixing a defect in the maintenance phase&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fagan|first=M. E.|date=1976|title=Design and code inspections to reduce errors in program development|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1147/sj.153.0182|journal=IBM Systems Journal|volume=15|issue=3|pages=182–211|doi=10.1147/sj.153.0182|issn=0018-8670}}&lt;/ref&gt;, it is essential to find defects as close to the point of insertion as possible. This is done by inspecting the output of each operation and comparing that to the output requirements, or [[exit criteria]], of that operation.

=== Criteria ===
Entry criteria are the criteria or requirements which must be met to enter a specific process.&lt;ref name="fagan86"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.mfagan.com/pdfs/aisi1986.pdf|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-48354-7_14|chapter=Advances in Software Inspections|title=Pioneers and Their Contributions to Software Engineering|pages=335|year=2001|last1=Fagan|first1=Michael E|isbn=978-3-540-42290-7|orig-year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, for Fagan inspections the high- and low-level documents must comply with specific entry criteria before they can be used for a formal inspection process.

Exit criteria are the criteria or requirements which must be met to complete a specific process. For example, for Fagan inspections the low-level document must comply with specific exit criteria (as specified in the high-level document) before the development process can be taken to the next phase.

The exit criteria are specified in a high-level document, which is then used as the standard to which the operation result (low-level document) is compared during the inspection. Any failure of the low-level document to satisfy the high-level requirements specified in the high-level document are called ''defects''&lt;ref name="fagan86"/&gt; (and can be further categorized as ''major'' or ''minor'' defects). Minor defects do not threaten the correct functioning of the software, but may be small errors such as spelling mistakes or unaesthetic positioning of controls in a [[graphical user interface]].

=== Typical operations ===
A typical Fagan inspection consists of the following operations:&lt;ref name="fagan86"/&gt;
* Planning
** Preparation of materials
** Arranging of participants
** Arranging of meeting place
* Overview
** Group education of participants on the materials under review
** Assignment of roles
* Preparation
** The participants review the item to be inspected and supporting material to prepare for the meeting noting any questions or possible defects
** The participants prepare their roles
* Inspection meeting
** Actual finding of defect
* Rework {{Anchor|Rework}}
** Rework is the step in software inspection in which the defects found during the inspection meeting are resolved by the author, designer or programmer. On the basis of the list of defects the low-level document is corrected until the requirements in the high-level document are met.
* Follow-up {{Anchor|Follow-up}}
** In the follow-up phase of software inspections all defects found in the inspection meeting should be corrected (as they have been fixed in the rework phase). The moderator is responsible for verifying that this is indeed the case. He should verify that all defects are fixed and no new defects are inserted while trying to fix the initial defects. It is crucial that all defects be corrected, as the costs of fixing them in a later phase of the project can be 10 to 100 times higher compared to the current costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fagan|first=M. E.|date=1976|title=Design and code inspections to reduce errors in program development|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1147/sj.153.0182|journal=IBM Systems Journal|volume=15|issue=3|pages=182–211|doi=10.1147/sj.153.0182|issn=0018-8670}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fagan Inspection Simple flow.svg|center|frame|Fagan inspection basic model]]

=== Follow-up ===
In the follow-up phase of a Fagan inspection, defects fixed in the rework phase should be verified. The moderator is usually responsible for verifying rework. Sometimes fixed work can be accepted without being verified, such as when the defect was trivial. In non-trivial cases, a full re-inspection is performed by the inspection team (not only the moderator).

If verification fails, go back to the rework process.

== Roles ==
The inspection process is normally performed by members of the same team that is implementing the project. The participants fulfill different roles within the inspection process:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Fagan|last=M.E.|title=Design and Code inspections to reduce errors in program development|year=1976|journal=IBM Systems Journal|volume=15|issue=3|pages=182–211|doi=10.1147/sj.153.0182|url=http://www.mfagan.com/pdfs/ibmfagan.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1109/SEW.2002.1199450|chapter=An empirical study of modifying the Fagan inspection process and the resulting main effects and interaction effects among defects found, effort required, rate of preparation and inspection, number of team members and product 1st pass quality|title=27th Annual NASA Goddard/IEEE Software Engineering Workshop, 2002. Proceedings|pages=58|year=2003|last1=Eickelmann|first1=N.S|last2=Ruffolo|first2=F|last3=Baik|first3=J|last4=Anant|first4=A|isbn=0-7695-1855-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Author/Designer/Coder: the person who wrote the low-level document
* Reader: paraphrases the low-level document
* Reviewers: reviews the low-level document from a testing standpoint
* Moderator: responsible for the inspection session, functions as a coach

== Benefits and results ==
By using inspections the number of errors in the final product can significantly decrease, creating a higher quality product. In the future the team will even be able to avoid errors as the inspection sessions give them insight into the most frequently made errors in both design and coding providing avoidance of error at the root of their occurrence. By continuously improving the inspection process these insights can even further be used &lt;ref name=fagan86 /&gt;.

Together with the qualitative benefits mentioned above major "cost improvements" can be reached as the avoidance and earlier detection of errors will reduce the amount of resources needed for debugging in later phases of the project.

In practice very positive results have been reported by large corporations such as IBM,{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} indicating that 80% to 90% of defects can be found and savings in resources up to 25% can be reached.&lt;ref name="fagan86"/&gt;

== Improvements ==
Although the Fagan inspection method has been proved to be very effective,{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} improvements have been suggested by multiple researchers. Genuchten{{who|date=November 2018}} for example has been researching the usage of an [[Electronic meeting system|Electronic Meeting System]] (EMS) to improve the productivity of the meetings with positive results &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Genuchten|first=M |author2=Cornelissen, W |author3=Van Dijk, C|title=Supporting Inspections with an Electronic Meeting System|journal=Journal of Management Information Systems|date=Winter 1997–1998|volume=14|issue=3|pages=165–179|doi=10.1080/07421222.1997.11518179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other researchers propose the usage of software that keeps a database of detected errors and automatically scans program code for these common errors &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Doolan|first=E.P.|title=Experience with Fagan's Inspection Method|journal=Software—Practice and Experience|date=February 1992|volume=22|issue=2|pages=173–182|doi=10.1002/spe.4380220205}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This again should result in improved productivity.

The '''(Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999) ''(FEMA)''''' is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]][[Parliament of India]] "to consolidate and amend the law relating to foreign exchange with the objective of facilitating external trade and payments and for promoting the orderly development and maintenance of foreign exchange market in India".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://finmin.nic.in/the_ministry/dept_eco_affairs/capital_market_div/FEMA_act_1999.pdf|title=THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE MANAGEMENT ACT, 1999|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was passed in the winter session of Parliament in 1999, replacing the [[Foreign Exchange Regulation Act]] (FERA). This act makes offences related to foreign exchange [[Civil law (common law)|civil offense]]s. It extends to the whole of [[India]].,&lt;ref name="FEMA, 1999"&gt;{{cite web |title=FEMA, 1999 |url=http://www.dor.gov.in/sites/upload_files/revenue/files/Foreign%20Exchange%20Management%20Act%201999.pdf |publisher=Dept of Revenue, Govt of India |accessdate=9 September 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AXmYchwr?url=http://www.indiankanoon.org/doc/600757/ |archivedate=9 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; replacing FERA, which had become incompatible with the pro- liberalization policies of the [[Government of India]]. It enabled a new [[Foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]] management regime consistent with the emerging framework of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO). It also paved the way for the introduction of the [[Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002]], which  came into effect from 1 July 2005.

==Description==

Unlike other laws where ''everything is permitted unless specifically prohibited'', under the [[Foreign Exchange Regulation Act]] (FERA) of 1973 (predecessor to FEMA) ''everything was prohibited unless specifically permitted''. Hence the tenor and tone of the Act was very drastic. It required imprisonment even for minor offences. Under FERA, ''a person was presumed guilty unless he proved himself innocent'', whereas under other laws ''a person is presumed innocent unless he is proven guilty''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=AC Fernando|title=Business Environment|pages=427|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xaHonZv5dfIC&amp;pg=PA427 |publisher=[[Pearson Education]] |isbn=9788131731581|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FEMA is a regulatory mechanism that enables the Reserve Bank of India to pass regulations and the Central Government to pass rules relating to foreign exchange in tune with the Foreign Trade policy of India.

==History==
===Foreign Exchange Regulation Act===
{{Infobox legislation
| short_title = Foreign Exchange Regulation Act
| status = Repealed
}}

The '''Foreign Exchange Regulation Act''' ('''FERA''') was legislation passed in [[India]] in 1973&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gktoday.in/foreign-exchange-regulation-act-1973-fera/|title=Foreign Exchange Regulation Act 1999 (FERA) - General Knowledge Today|website=www.gktoday.in|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; that imposed strict regulations on certain kinds of payments, the dealings in [[foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]] (forex)and [[securities]] and the transactions which had an indirect impact on the foreign exchange and the import and export of [[currency]].&lt;ref name="rbi"&gt;http://rbi.org.in/scripts/PublicationReportDetails.aspx?ID=377&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was formulated with the aim of regulating payments and foreign exchange.&lt;ref name="rbi"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://indiankanoon.org/doc/27905/|title=The Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973|website=indiankanoon.org|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FERA came into force with effect from January 1, 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.karmayog.org/centralgovtacts/centralgovtacts_6243.htm|title=The Foreign Exchange Regulation Acts (FERA) {{!}} Government  Acts (Alphabetically) {{!}} Central Govt. Acts (in alphabetical order) {{!}} www.karmayog.org|website=www.karmayog.org|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better|date=April 2017}}

FERA was introduced at a time when foreign exchange (Forex) reserves of the country were low, Forex being a scarce commodity. FERA therefore proceeded on the presumption that all foreign exchange earned by Indian residents rightfully belonged to the Government of India and had to be collected and surrendered to the [[Reserve Bank of India]] (RBI). FERA primarily prohibited all transactions not permitted by RBI.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.moneycontrol.com/glossary/property/fera_613.html|title=FERA|website=www.moneycontrol.com|access-date=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better|date=April 2017}}

Coca-Cola was India's leading soft drink until 1977 when it left India after a new government ordered the company to turn over its secret formula for Coca-Cola and dilute its stake in its Indian unit as required by the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA). In 1993, the company (along with PepsiCo) returned after the introduction of India's Liberalization policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/what-has-foreign-exchange-regulation-act-achieved/1/391995.html |title=FERA: The end of an era |work=[[India Today]] |date=5 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switch from FERA===
FERA did not succeed in restricting activities such as the expansion of Multinational Corporations. The concessions made to FERA in 1991-1993 showed that FERA was on the verge of becoming redundant. After the amendment of FERA in 1993, it was decided that the act would become the FEMA. This was done in order to relax the controls on foreign exchange in India.


FERA was repealed in 1998 by the government of [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]] and replaced by the Foreign Exchange Management Act, which liberalised [[foreign exchange controls]] and restrictions on foreign investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2005-11-27/news/27487763_1_fera-person-of-indian-origin-indian-passport |title=The Crucial difference |work=[[The Economic Times]] |date=27 November 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/foreign-exchange-regulation-act-had-a-controversial-stint-from-1973-to-2002/1/205502.html |title=FERA: Businessman's POTA |work=[[India Today]] |date=18 August 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2005-11-27/news/27487763_1_fera-person-of-indian-origin-indian-passport|title=The Crucial difference|website=timesofindia-economictimes|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The buying and selling of foreign currency and other debt instruments by businesses, individuals and governments happens in the foreign exchange market. Apart from being very competitive, this market is also the largest and most liquid market in the world as well as in India.It constantly undergoes changes and innovations, which can either be beneficial to a country or expose them to greater risks. The management of foreign exchange market becomes necessary in order to mitigate and avoid the risks. Central banks would work towards an orderly functioning of the transactions which can also develop their foreign exchange market. Foreign Exchange Market Whether under FERA or FEMA’s control, the need for the management of foreign exchange is important. It is necessary to keep adequate amount of foreign exchange from Import Substitution to Export Promotion.{{cn|date=December 2016}}

The '''Graduate Management Admission Council''' ('''GMAC''') is an international non-profit organization of business schools that provides products and services to academic institutions and prospective graduate management education students. The organization owns the [[Graduate Management Admission Test]] (GMAT), a standardized assessment that is widely used by graduate [[business studies|business administration]] programs (e.g. [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]], [[Master of Accountancy]], Master of Finance, Master of Science in Business/Management, etc.) to measure quantitative, verbal, analytical and integrated reasoning skills in applicants. GMAC also provides survey research and market analysis aimed at helping graduate management admissions professionals make informed decisions, and serves as an information source for journalists and members of the public interested in information about management education and the role it plays in the global economy.

GMAC is based in [[Reston, Virginia]]. In 2007, the organization opened an office in [[London]], its first international location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmac.com/gmac/newsandevents/pressroom/pressreleases/lbsofficialtoleadeuropeanoperationsofgmac.htm |title=London Business School Official to Lead European Operations of Graduate Management Education Group |accessdate=17 June 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080402102134/http://www.gmac.com/gmac/newsandevents/pressroom/pressreleases/lbsofficialtoleadeuropeanoperationsofgmac.htm |archivedate=2 April 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; GMAC also has offices based in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Gurgaon, India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.gmac.com/service/contact-us.aspx | title= GMAC Contact us and Locations| accessdate=9 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Graduate Management Admission Council has 212 member schools from 22 countries, including Australia, Canada, China, France, Great Britain, India and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.gmac.com/why-gmac/the-gmac-advantage/gmac-history-timeline.aspx| title= GMAC History | accessdate=9 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the organization embarked on an effort to increase its membership outside North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Graduate Management Admission Council Introduces New Global Executive Team | accessdate=17 June 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080402103824/http://www.gmac.com/gmac/newsandevents/pressroom/pressreleases/gmacintroducesnewglobalexecutiveteam.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2 April 2008|url= http://www.gmac.com/gmac/newsandevents/pressroom/pressreleases/gmacintroducesnewglobalexecutiveteam.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; GMAC is governed by a 15-member board of directors that includes representation from business schools and private industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.gmac.com/about-us/board-of-directors.aspx| title=Board of Directors | accessdate=9 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He finished [[Bergen Commerce School]] before taking education in France, England and Belgium between 1886 and 1889. He took over his father's company which traded in fishing and angling tools in 1891, and ran it together with his brother-in-law Hjalmar Grung as ''Blydt &amp; Grung''. He retired in 1929. From 1912 he was also a commissary for [[Bergen Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref name=nsd&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsd.uib.no/polsys/index.cfm?urlname=storting&amp;lan=&amp;MenuItem=N1_1&amp;ChildItem=&amp;State=collapse&amp;UttakNr=33&amp;person=10356|title=Jørgen Blydt|publisher=Norwegian Social Science Data Services (NSD)|language=Norwegian|accessdate=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a member of Bergen city council, and was first elected to the [[Parliament of Norway]] in [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 1899|1899]] from the plural-member constituency Bergen.&lt;ref name=nsd/&gt; In the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 1906|1906]] he ran in the single-member constituency [[Kalfaret]], and was elected deputy as the running mate of [[Johan Ludwig Mowinckel]]. The race was unusually close, with Mowinckel/Blydt edging out [[Johan Lothe|Lothe]]/[[Klaus Hanssen|Hanssen]] of the [[Coalition Party (Norway)|Coalition Party]] with 932 against 914 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{stort06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 1909|1909]] Blydt ran in [[Nordnes]], but finished third behind [[Fredrik Ludvig Konow|Konow]] and [[Kristian Hopp|Hopp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{stort09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 1912|1912]] Blydt ran in [[Sandviken]], and finished second behind Labour's [[Lars Sæbø]].&lt;ref&gt;{{stort12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 1915|1915 parliamentary election]], Blydt ran in the last of Bergen's four constituencies, [[Nygård, Norway|Nygaard]], in the first round. He finished second (with 2,446 votes) behind Labour's [[S. K. Tjønneland]] (2,563 votes) but ahead of Conservative [[Henrik Ameln]] (2,056 votes). A runoff vote had to be held. However, both Blydt and Tjønneland were pulled from the race. The reason was that Blydt had run in Sandviken as well, and though finishing second behind Lars Sæbø again, he managed to reach the runoff here. In this runoff, Blydt won the seat with 3,836 votes against Sæbø's 3,429.&lt;ref&gt;{{stort15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He thus served a second term as an MP, and like fifteen years prior, he was a member of the Standing Committee on Trade.&lt;ref name=nsd/&gt;

Particularly during the First World War he was a member of numerous committees that sprang up as the state needed more control over enterprise. He chaired one of these committees, the Coal Provisioning Committee of 1917. He chaired Bergen Commercial Association for five years, and Bergen Chamber of Commerce from 1915 to 1926. Nationally, he was a board member of [[Norges Handelsstands Forbund|Den Norske Handelsstands Fællesforening]] from 1909 to 1916, and he was also a council member of the [[International Chamber of Commerce]]. He was a board member of [[Bergens Kreditbank]] (1906–1922), [[Fiskeribanken]] (1921–1936), [[Norges Eksportråd|Norges Oplysningskontor for Næringsveiene]] and the [[Norwegian America Line]]. He was a council member of the [[Chr. Michelsen Institute]] and a supervisory committee member of the [[Bergen Line]].&lt;ref name=nsd/&gt;

In culture, he was a board member of [[Den Nationale Scene]] from 1913 to 1931, chairing it for the last two years. He was a member of the Order Council, which rewards the [[Order of St. Olav]], from 1925, and served as vice chancellor in 1931 and chancellor from 1932 to his death in 1938.&lt;ref name=nsd/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=70 år|date=14 March 1938|work=Aftenposten|page=8|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dødsfall|date=29 April 1938|work=Aftenposten|page=11|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kista''' ({{IPA-sv|ˈɕiːsta}}) is a district in the [[Districts of Sweden#Stockholm|borough]] of [[Rinkeby-Kista]], [[Stockholm Municipality|Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]. It has a strategic position located in between Sweden's main airport, the [[Stockholm Arlanda Airport|Stockholm-Arlanda International Airport]] and central Stockholm, and alongside the main [[European route E4|national highway E4]] economic artery. Kista comprises residential and commercial areas, the latter in the highly technological [[telecommunication]] and [[information technology]] industry.&lt;ref name="OECD2013"/&gt; There are large research efforts in this entire area, which therefore is dubbed Kista Science City. It is known{{By whom?|date=October 2017}} as the research park of [[Royal Institute of Technology|KTH Royal Institute of Technology]].

Kista is the largest [[Information and communications technology|Information and Communications Technology (ICT)]] cluster in Europe,&lt;ref name="kista.com"&gt;http://www.kista.com&lt;/ref&gt; and the world's second largest&lt;ref&gt;Page 84.

It is the largest corporate area in Sweden, important to the national economy&lt;ref name="Kim2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kim|first=Junmo|title=Globalization and Industrial Development|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=__lZdK1S4OkC&amp;pg=PA73|date=10 July 2005|isbn=978-1-4697-2393-8|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the presence of, among others, [[Ericsson Group]], the largest corporation in Sweden.

Kista Science City is the location where a large portion of the research and development of the world's [[LTE (telecommunication)|4G LTE]] mobile telephony infrastructure is being developed, a European [[ETSI]] standard used worldwide and Kista Science City has been the largest such cluster in Europe for decades.{{When?|date=October 2017}}&lt;ref name="kista.com"/&gt; A majority is done at [[Ericsson|Ericsson corporation]], with 100,000 employees worldwide, but with its research and worldwide Headquarters in the Kista Science City.

Kista was named after an old farm "Kista Gård", still located in the area. The construction of the modern parts were started in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="AntonellaEmma2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Antonella|first1=Noya|last2=Emma|first2=Clarence|last3=Gary|first3=Craig|title=Local Economic and Employment Development (LEED) Community Capacity Building Creating a Better Future Together: Creating a Better Future Together|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8_TFVEFrqSsC&amp;pg=PA119|date=7 December 2009|publisher=OECD Publishing|isbn=978-92-64-07329-6|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the streets in Kista are named after towns and places in [[Denmark]], [[Iceland]], [[Greenland]], and [[Faroe Islands]]. Before the opening of the [[Mall of Scandinavia]], [[Kista Galleria]] was the biggest shopping center in the [[Stockholm County|Stockholm region]]. 
Because of its [[Information and communication technologies|ICT]] industries, it became in the 1980s referred to as "Chipsta"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.se/books?id=Z-dXAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA120&amp;lpg=PA120&amp;dq=Chipsta+kista&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8qjzjkswI8&amp;sig=ZCf-NhrPh8iVUvsLFXXgD6OkEco&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiMjKqUu87eAhVJqIsKHQ89CrkQ6AEwDXoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Chipsta%20kista&amp;f=false|title=Urban Innovation Systems: What makes them tick?|last=Winden|first=Willem van|last2=Braun|first2=Erik|last3=Otgaar|first3=Alexander|last4=Witte|first4=Jan-Jelle|date=2014-04-11|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317917458|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, after Sweden joined the EU in 1995, also as Europe's "Silicon Valley".&lt;ref name="AntonellaEmma2009"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nordichardware.se/Coverage/overclocking-at-intel.html|title=Overclocking at Intel|publisher=Nordichardware.se|accessdate=4 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economy ==
Kista is the largest corporate area in Sweden and important to the national economy.&lt;ref name="OECD2013"&gt;{{cite book|title=OECD Green Growth Studies Green Growth in Stockholm, Sweden|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4G3oCqJJJScC&amp;pg=PA70|date=23 May 2013|publisher=OECD Publishing|isbn=978-92-64-19515-8|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The construction of the industrial section of Kista began in the 1970s with companies such as SRA (Svenska Radioaktiebolaget, now a part of [[Ericsson]]), RIFA AB (later Ericsson Components AB, and later still Ericsson Microelectronics AB, and now Infineon Technologies), and IBM Svenska AB (the Swedish branch of [[International Business Machines|IBM]]). [[Ericsson]] has had its headquarters in Kista since 2003.&lt;ref name="Kim2005"/&gt;

== Research and higher learning ==

Kista hosts entire departments of both [[Royal Institute of Technology|KTH Royal Institute of Technology]], such as Wireless@KTH, and [[Stockholm University]] (formerly jointly known as "the IT University").&lt;ref name="DesaiNijkamp2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=[[Sameeksha Desai|Desai]]|first1=Sameeksha|last2=Nijkamp|first2=Peter|last3=Stough|first3=Roger R.|title=New Directions in Regional Economic Development: The Role of Entrepreneurship Theory and Methods, Practice and Policy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S6eY4LtrIOcC&amp;pg=PA249|date=July 2011|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=978-0-85793-351-5|page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also Swedish national research institutes (pure research, no students) such as the [[Swedish Institute of Computer Science]] and [[Swedish Defence Research Agency|Swedish Defence Research Agency, FOI]] who has its Headquarters there, just as [[Ericsson]],  [[IBM|Swedish IBM]] and [[Tele 2]], among others has.

In the law of the sale of [[property]] (both [[real estate]] and [[personal property]] or [[Personal property|chattels]]) a '''latent defect''' is a fault in the property that could not have been discovered by a reasonably thorough inspection before the sale.

The general law of the sale of property is [[caveat emptor]] (let the buyer beware) and buyers are under a general duty to inspect their purchase before taking [[Possession (law)|possession]].  However, it is understood at law that inspection is often not sufficient to detect certain deficiencies in the product that can only be discovered through destructive testing or other means that a seller could not reasonably be expected to allow under normal conditions.  For example, wood beams and interior brickwork often cannot be fully assessed without destructive testing, and it would be unreasonable for the seller to allow the buyer to destroy part of the property in order to discover such defects.

As such, the law expects that buyers will protect themselves in the sales [[contract]] against defects they cannot possibly be expected to assess prior to purchase.  As such, the term "latent defect" is often used as part of the guarantee clauses in a sales contract so that the buyer can recover damages from the seller if defects turn up in the property after the sale.  For example, the seller may be required to pay for repairs of any such damage.

In Common Law, there is no automatic right for a buyer to claim against a seller for such latent defects when they are discovered, absent an agreement in contract.  Civil Law in some jurisdictions (Quebec, Canada) does provide for such an automatic right unless a property is sold "without guarantee" as to its quality.  However, if a latent defect is discovered, there is often a presumption against the seller when a claim is made in misrepresentation that the seller knew about the latent defect.  As such, the seller is required to show that he or she could not possibly have known of the defect, rather than the buyer having to show that the seller did know about the defect.  However, if it can be shown the seller could not have known about the defect (and was not [[willful blindness|wilfully blind]] to the possibility) then the buyer's claim will not succeed.

However, when the defect could have been discovered by the buyer by a thorough inspection (a "[[patent defect]]"), the buyer cannot possibly succeed in a claim against the seller unless the seller actively took steps to hide the defect from a normal inspection.

In all cases, where a seller actively [[misrepresentation|misrepresents]] the condition of the property, such as by taking steps to make an inspection impossible or by lying about problems when directly asked, the buyer will almost always succeed unless it can be shown that the buyer was independently aware of the defect and completed the transaction nevertheless.

In construction contracting a latent defect is defined as a defect which exists at the time of acceptance but cannot be discovered by a reasonable inspection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acquisition.gov/far/97/pdf/46.pdf |title=Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) PART 46—QUALITY ASSURANCE |page=2 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407085608/http://www.acquisition.gov/far/97/pdf/46.pdf |archive-date=2014-04-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Malay titles|Tan Sri Dato Seri]] [[Doctor (title)|(Dr.)]] '''Lim Goh Tong''' ({{zh|c=林梧桐|p=Lín Wútóng|poj=Lîm Ngô͘-tông}}; 28 February 1918 – 23 October 2007) was a prominent wealthy [[Malaysian Chinese]] businessman &amp; entrepreneur. He was renowned for his vision and courage in transforming [[Genting Highlands]] from an unexplored hilltop into one of the world's most successful casino resorts. He was once the richest man in [[Malaysia]] with a net worth of US$4.2billion&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;Net worth from [https://www.forbes.com/lists/2007/10/07billionaires_Lim-Goh-Tong-family_BZLF.html Forbes: The World's Richest People], dated 6 March 2007. He died on 23 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born in 1918 in [[Anxi County|Anxi]], a mountainous county in southeastern [[Fujian]] province, China, Lim Goh Tong was the fifth child in his family. He had an elder brother (Jing Ya), three elder sisters (Lim Zhuang, Lim Bau and Lim See), a younger sister (Lim Mei) and a younger brother (Jing Kun). Lim was born into a rustic environment in a village. During that time, China was in a period of turmoil and unrest after the [[Xinhai Revolution|1911 revolution]], but life was relatively sheltered for Lim in the village. He grew up peacefully and had the opportunity of studying in school. However, disaster struck and his father died when he was 16. Lim was forced to leave school and he and his elder brother had to take over the heavy burden of feeding his family.&lt;ref name="ch1"&gt;''My Story – Lim Goh Tong'', Chapter 1: Beginnings&lt;/ref&gt;

As China's situation was becoming worse, Lim Goh Tong decided to take the plunge in venturing out to [[Malaysia]] (known as Malaya at that time) following in his cousin, Lim Kheng Chong's footsteps. He left China through [[Xiamen]] in early February 1937 at the age of 19. He worked for his uncle as a carpenter in the first two years, learning the [[Malay language]] in the meantime. After gaining experience he went on to become a building sub-contractor and completed his first job of building a two-storey school. He returned to Anxi in 1940, but went back to Malaya the next year amidst a deteriorating war environment.&lt;ref name="ch1"/&gt;

==Career and business==
The [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] [[Japanese occupation of Malaya, North Borneo and Sarawak|invaded Malaya]] in 1942 and caused Lim to have a few near-death experiences. During the early Japanese Occupation, he earned a living as a vegetable farmer, but decided to switch to petty trading for a better living. Later on Lim ventured into scrap-metal and hardware trading. When the Japanese Occupation ended, there was an urgent demand for heavy machinery for resumed operations in mines and rubber plantations. Lim seized the opportunity and engaged in second-hand machinery trading, making his first fortune.&lt;ref name="ch2"&gt;''My Story – Lim Goh Tong'', Chapter 2: The Formative Years of Business&lt;/ref&gt;

From used machinery trading, Lim strayed into iron mining, joining as a partner in an iron mining company which couldn't settle the outstanding payment of two bulldozers with him. This proved to be a successful venture, and he later went on to form a joint-venture company which was one of the first Chinese tin companies to utilise dredges.&lt;ref name="ch4"&gt;''My Story – Lim Goh Tong'', Chapter 4: Mining Ventures: Seizing Opportunities&lt;/ref&gt;

While dealing in heavy machinery, Lim accumulated a wide range of reconditioned machines as well as a substantial amount of cash to move into construction and related industries. In the name of his family construction company, Kien Huat Private Limited, Lim began taking on several contracting jobs with help and guidance from his uncles. Kien Huat won accolades and became recognised as one of the leading construction companies, building the Ayer Itam Dam&lt;ref name="ch5"&gt;''My Story – Lim Goh Tong'', Chapter 5: Building a Name as a Contractor&lt;/ref&gt; and the Kemubu Irrigation Scheme.&lt;ref name="ch6"&gt;''My Story – Lim Goh Tong'', Chapter 6: The Kemubu Scheme: Brink of Bankruptcy&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developing Genting Resort===
{{main|Genting Highlands}}
Genting Group's involvement in the property sector can be traced from the initial primary objective of holding land-based assets for long term appreciation and development potential to the current strategic move to develop and market the Group's landed properties mainly held in the plantation subsidiary, by Asiatic Land Development Sdn Bhd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Asiatic Development Berhad – which is 54.8% owned by Genting Berhad.
[[File:Genting Highlands.jpg|thumb|250px|The Genting Highlands Theme Park]]

The idea of building a hilltop resort was first conceived when Lim Goh Tong was having a dinner in the [[Cameron Highlands]]. As he was enjoying the soothing cool breeze of the Cameron Highlands, an idea struck him that as the standard of living rose steadily in Malaysia, more and more people would visit mountain resorts for relaxation and recreation, but Cameron Highlands was too far away from the capital city [[Kuala Lumpur]], therefore building a mountain resort nearer to Kuala Lumpur would have great business potential.&lt;ref name="ch7"&gt;''My Story – Lim Goh Tong'', Chapter 7: Development of Genting Highlands: Labour of Love&lt;/ref&gt;

After doing some research, Lim found Gunung (mountain in Malay) Ulu Kali at a place called Genting Sempah to be an ideal location for his plan. He formed an expedition and explored the place, collecting a wealth of data on the topography, drainage, soil conditions and other relevant aspects of the region, which proved to be very useful in drawing up plans for developing the resort.&lt;ref name="ch7"/&gt;

Upon conceiving this idea, many naysayers were sceptical of Lim turning a wilderness into a tourist resort. Most thought it was really risky and reckoned Lim who was financially comfortable to be foolish to invest heavily in money and time to develop Genting, but Lim brushed off all these negativities and went ahead firmly with his plan.&lt;ref name="ch7"/&gt;

After getting approvals from the Federal and State governments, Lim began the project in the face of a colossal task. Among the problems were building the access road towards the hilltop, water and electricity supplies, sewerage system and fire safety. Lim managed to build the access road towards the summit in three years when it was estimated to take fifteen years. Several sources of water in the mountain were identified, water supply was secured by building water-collection stations and water filtration plants with treated water stored in reservoirs. Electricity is supplied through a central electricity generation system with 12 big generators.&lt;ref name="ch7"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ch8"&gt;''My Story – Lim Goh Tong'', Chapter 8: Resort Infrastructure and Beyond&lt;/ref&gt;

During the construction, Lim survived six close brushes with death. Meanwhile, Lim had to administer another major project in [[Kelantan]], the Kemubu Irrigation Scheme at the same time. This stretched his physical endurance to the limits as he had to shuttle between Kuala Lumpur and Kelantan and he worked seven days a week.&lt;ref name="ch7"/&gt;

During the Genting project, Lim spent all he had without earning any income. He sold an 810-hectare rubber estate to raise RM2.5 million. In addition, he invested all the money he had made from iron mining, sub-contracting and hardware businesses. The project was a heavy drain on Lim's finances. When asked to invest in this project, Lim's friends turned him down and counselled him to drop the entire scheme instead.&lt;ref name="ch7"/&gt;

Genting was granted the only casino licence after [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]], then prime minister of Malaysia, visited Genting Highlands and commended Lim's effort to develop a resort contributing to Malaysia's tourism industry without government help.&lt;ref name="ch7"/&gt;

Lim managed to obtain a pioneer status for Genting Highlands and tax incentives despite its resort development not qualifying for it. He did so by convincing the government that tax incentives in the early stage of development of Genting Highlands were not only vital for them but also profitable to the government later on.&lt;ref name="ch7"/&gt;

The whole Genting project was completed in January 1971, but prior to officially commencing business, Kuala Lumpur and its surrounding areas were hit by the worst rainstorms in a century, the road to Genting was closed by landslides at 180 locations, the damaged sections took four months to repair.  Genting opened its door for business on 8 May 1971.&lt;ref name="ch7"/&gt;

In the next 30 years, Lim continued to develop and expand Genting Highlands beyond its original idea of a hotel with basic tourist facilities.  Among the projects were the construction of more hotels, indoor and outdoor theme parks, and a convention centre.  A new road was built to shorten the journey to Genting from the northern states, and RM920 million was invested to widen a 10&amp;nbsp;km stretch of the access road to reduce congestion. Another RM928 million was spent on constructing a cable car system to provide visitors with an alternative mode of transportation.&lt;ref name="ch8"/&gt;

In 1993, at the suggestion of [[Tun Mahathir]], the prime minister of Malaysia then, a township was developed on an 81-hectare piece of land around the site of the Genting Skyway cable car station.  It was named Gohtong Jaya after Lim as a token of remembrance for his efforts in the development of Genting Highlands.&lt;ref name="ch8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ch9"&gt;''My Story – Lim Goh Tong'', Chapter 9: Genting and the Tourism Industry&lt;/ref&gt;

As of now, Genting Highlands is one of the most successful Casino resorts in the world and is one of the primary tourist attractions in Malaysia. Lim's company, [[Genting Group]] operates Genting Highlands and has diversified into many other industries such as plantations, property, paper, power generation, oil and gas exploration and cruise boat industries. In the process new company brands were created that have become distinctive names in their respective fields, namely Asiatic, [[Genting Sanyen]] (paper manufacturing) and [[Star Cruises]].&lt;ref name="ch10"&gt;''My Story – Lim Goh Tong'', Chapter 10: Diversification&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 December 2003, Lim handed his chairmanship of Genting Group over to his son, Tan Sri [[Lim Kok Thay]]/ [[Lim Yi Xiang]].&lt;ref name="ch13"&gt;''My Story – Lim Goh Tong'', Chapter 13: Moving On&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Lim Goh Tong was married to Lee Kim Hua in 1944, together they had six children and nineteen grandchildren.&lt;ref name="ch3"&gt;''My Story – Lim Goh Tong'', Chapter 3: My Wife – My Family&lt;/ref&gt; The six children are Lim Siew Lay, Siew Lian, Siew Kim, Tee Keong, Kok Thay and Chee Wah.&lt;ref&gt;''My Story – Lim Goh Tong''&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout his life Lim has had a few medical crises, among them were a malignant tumour and cardiovascular problems, which he pulled through after several surgeries.&lt;ref name="ch11"&gt;''My Story – Lim Goh Tong'', Chapter 11: Medical Crises in My Life&lt;/ref&gt;

Lim wrote his autobiography "My Story – Lim Goh Tong" and it was published in 2004. In the book he wrote about his early life, how he started off with nothing to building a world-class casino resort through hard work and perseverance confounding sceptics, and the people he acknowledges.

10 years after Goh Tong’s death, on 25 August 2017, his wife Kim Hua died at the age of 88.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017/08/25/lim-goh-tong-widow-passes-away/ Genting tycoon’s widow passes away] ''[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star Online]]'' (August 25, 2017). Retrieved November 14, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Achievement and awards ==
Lim Goh Tong had won many awards together with his company Genting Group for his entrepreneurship and his contribution, among them were:
* Malaysian Entrepreneurs Award 1985
* Manager of the Year Award 1986
* Business Achiever of the Year Award1994
* Number 1 ranking of 10 Malaysian Leading Companies 1999
* The Best Employer Award 1996&lt;ref name="ch12"&gt;''My Story – Lim Goh Tong'', Chapter 12: Acknowledgements&lt;/ref&gt;

He was conferred the title "[[Malay titles|Tan Sri]]" by the government of Malaysia on 6 June 1979 in recognition to the contribution he has made to the country.&lt;ref name="ch12"/&gt;

In 1978 Lim Goh Tong set up Yayasan Lim, a family foundation that donates regularly to educational and medical institutions, old folk's homes, various organisations for the physically handicapped and other charitable causes.&lt;ref name="ch12"/&gt;

* [[The Black Eyed Peas]] who were performing on the night of 26 October in Genting [[Arena of Stars]] paid tribute to Lim Goh Tong during their concert. "A man died recently who was responsible for the place where we are today. I'd like to ask for a moment of silence to honour his life and legacy," will.i.am said in his tribute.

More than 20,000 people, including royalty, Asia's rich and famous, politicians, friends, business allies and members of the public paid tribute to Goh Tong in their own ways. They either attended the wake, sent wreaths or penned messages of sympathy.

Among those who paid their respect to Lim were
* Dato' Seri [[Ong Ka Ting]], Chairman of the [[Malaysian Chinese Association|Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA)]]

Asia's second richest man, [[Li Ka Shing]] (He is now first), sent a personal condolence note to the bereaved family, offering words that perhaps best captured the essence of who Goh Tong was.

'''Mourad Wahba Pasha''' (1879-1972) was an [[Egypt]]ian high court judge and cabinet minister.

Mourad Wahba was born in Cairo, Egypt in 1879, the son of [[Youssef Wahba]] Pasha (1852-1934) former [[prime minister of Egypt]] and grandson of Wahba Bey Youssef a founder of the first [[Copts|Coptic]] charitable society. Wahba was educated in Cairo at the [[College de la Sainte Famille]], a [[Jesuit]] School where [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] taught for many years. He obtained his law degree from the [[Sorbonne]] in Paris and pursued a lifetime career in the Egyptian judicial system, serving as a judge on the Native Court of Appeals and then becoming a counsellor on the first [[Court of Cassation (Egypt)|Court of Cassation]], the highest court in Egypt, from 1931 to 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Report from the British Foreign Office, July 1946-December 1946, part 4, Volume II. See also [[Mixed Courts of Egypt]]&lt;/ref&gt; He was highly respected and appreciated by all political parties as an objective and unassuming judge that gave much credibility to the new Court of Cassation. A famous opinion written by Wahba Pasha relates to the revocation of press censorship imposed at the time by [[Ismail Sidqi]] Pasha, then prime minister of Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Marcel Colombe (1952) "L'Evolution de l'Egypte 1924-1950", ''Bulletin de la Societe de Geographie''&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that he was personally appointed Minister of Agriculture by [[King Farouk]] in the [[Muhammad Mahmoud Pasha]] Cabinet in 1937 then Minister of Trade and Industry in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Agriculture, Arab Republic of Egypt website&lt;/ref&gt; During his tenure as Minister of Agriculture, he inaugurated the Cairo Agricultural Museum, the largest museum at the time devoted to agriculture since Ancient Egypt.

As an apolitical civil servant, he was reportedly disappointed by his appointment as minister which had forced him to resign his position on the Court of Cassation. As Vice President of the Court of Cassation he had expected to become president upon the retirement of [[Abdel Aziz Fahmi]] Pasha, the then President of the Court. His appointment as minister of agriculture may have been to avoid having a [[Copt]] as president of the highest judicial authority in Egypt, a predominantly Muslim country. He was appointed a senator in 1939 until 1945.  He played an important role in Coptic communal affairs serving on the [[Majlis Milli]] for several years.&lt;ref&gt;British Documents on Foreign Affairs. Reports and Papers from the Foreign Office, Confidential Print. Africa Section, 1946, part 4, University Publications of America, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the major shareholders of the [[Compagnie de Ciment Portland]] in Egypt founded with the Swiss cement group [[Holderbank (company)|Holderbank]] as well as a member of the board of directors of [[Banque Misr]] and resigned after the 1952 revolution. He was married to Victoria Ibrahim, daughter of Khalil Ibrahim Pasha, one of the largest landowners in Egypt who had built [[Our Lady of Zeitoun]] Church in Zeitun, Cairo, the site of various reported apparitions of the Virgin Mary in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Meinardus, ''Two Thousand Years of Coptic Christianity'', The American University in Cairo, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He had one child, [[Magdi Wahba]], and died in Cairo in 1972.

==Early life and education==
Mikati was born on 24 November 1955&lt;ref name=bbc11&gt;{{cite news|title=Profile: Najib Mikati|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12277773|accessdate=6 October 2012|newspaper=BBC|date=25 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and hails from a prominent [[Sunni Islam in Lebanon|Sunni Muslim]] family based in [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Harris|title=Lebanon: A History, 600-2011|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jY4ImTGnamUC&amp;pg=PA347|accessdate=18 March 2013|date=19 July 2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-518111-1|pages=347}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from the [[American University of Beirut]] in 1980 with a [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) degree.&lt;ref name=marco15oct&gt;{{cite news|title=Lebanese Power-brokers: The Most Powerful Families of Lebanon|url=http://www.marcopolis.net/lebanese-power-brokers-the-most-powerful-families-of-lebanon-1510.htm|accessdate=23 March 2013|newspaper=Marcopolis|date=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also attended a summer school program held at Harvard and the French business school [[INSEAD]].&lt;ref name=bbc11/&gt;

He sold the company in June 2006 to South Africa's [[MTN Group]] for $5.5&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite news|title=The World's Billionaires|url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2008/10/billionaires08_Najib-Mikati_EF3J.html|accessdate=4 January 2011|newspaper=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2015, ''[[Forbes]]'' estimated his net worth at $3.3 billion, making him the richest man in Lebanon.&lt;ref name=formarch&gt;{{cite news|title=Forbes' Billionaires|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/najib-mikati/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
After being appointed Minister of Public Works and Transport on 4 December 1998, Mikati was elected to the [[National Assembly of Lebanon|Lebanese parliament]] from his hometown of [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]] in 2000, outpolling [[Omar Karami]], who was elected from the same multimember constituency. As a parliamentarian, Mikati retained his cabinet position and developed a reputation as a moderately pro-Syrian politician with a normal relationship with Syrian [[List of Presidents of Syria|president]] [[Bashar Assad]]. Later Mikati was made transportation minister and became an ally of then Lebanese president [[Émile Lahoud|Emile Lahoud]], supporting the extension of his term in 2004.&lt;ref name=moh8sep&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fakih|first=Mohalhel|title=Pulling at Lebanon's strings|journal=Al Ahram Weekly|date=2–8 September 2004|volume=706|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/706/re4.htm|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a perennial candidate for Lebanon's prime ministry since 2000, finally taking the office upon the resignation of Omar Karami on 13 April 2005.&lt;ref name=assir27apr&gt;{{cite journal|last=Assir|first=Serene|title=Divided we fall|journal=Al Ahram Weekly|date=21–27 April 2005|volume=739|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/739/re5.htm|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mikati acted as a caretaker premier.&lt;ref name=blo13jun&gt;{{cite news|title=Lebanon’s Mikati Forms New Cabinet With Hezbollah Support|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-13/lebanon-s-mikati-forms-new-cabinet-with-hezbollah-support.html|accessdate=6 March 2013|newspaper=Bloomberg|date=13 June 2011|author=Alaa Shahine|author2=Massoud A. Derhally}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the leader of the solidarity bloc, which has had two seats in the Lebanese parliament since 2004. He also created the centrist movement and ideology in Lebanon and the Arab world, for which he has held many international conferences in Lebanon. In [[Lebanese General Elections 2009|the general elections]] of 2009, Mikati won again a seat from Tripoli, being a member of the centrist groups in the Lebanese parliament.&lt;ref name=ifes&gt;{{cite web|title=Elections in Lebanon|url=http://qifanabki.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/ifes-lebanon-electoral-districts-2011.pdf|publisher=IFES|accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First premiership==
During negotiations to form a government, Mikati emerged as a consensus candidate.&lt;ref name="arabnews"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hosri|first=Danielle|title=Opposition-Backed Moderate Mikati Named Lebanese PM|url=http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=4&amp;section=0&amp;article=62209&amp;d=16&amp;m=4&amp;y=2005|accessdate=4 January 2011|newspaper=Arab News|date=16 April 2005|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616060530/http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=4&amp;section=0&amp;article=62209&amp;d=16&amp;m=4&amp;y=2005|archivedate=16 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite his closeness to Syria, his willingness to compromise and his promise to dismiss the chiefs of the security forces, whom many Lebanese suspected of involvement in the assassination of former prime minister [[Rafik Hariri]] on 14 February 2005, won him the support of the anti-Syrian opposition, who were opposed to [[Abdul Rahim Mourad]], the strongly pro-Syrian minister of defense. "We will be the symbol of moderation and national unity," Mikati declared after being sworn in at the [[Baabda Palace|Presidential palace]] in [[Baabda]].{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

He was appointed Prime Minister by president Émile Lahoud on 15 April 2005 to succeed [[Omar Karami]], who gave up after seven weeks of frustrated efforts to form a [[consensus government]] and resigned. Mikati held office for three months, with the position being transferred to [[Fouad Siniora]] on 19 July 2005.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

Mikati's immediate priority was to prepare Lebanon for crucial parliamentary elections, which were scheduled to be held by 31 May 2005.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} Constitutionally, a government must be in place to call for an election, and opposition politicians had accused president Lahoud and former prime minister Karami of stalling the formation of a government in order to thwart the elections, which anti-Syrian parties believed they could win.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} Mikati's government succeeded in organizing the election, which saw the opposition (by that time known as the [[14 March Alliance|14 March Movement]]) win 72 out of the 128 seats in the [[National Assembly of Lebanon|National Assembly]].{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

==Second premiership==

On 24 January 2011, the [[March 8 alliance]], specifically [[Hezbollah]], [[Michel Aoun]] and [[Walid Jumblatt]], nominated Mikati to become prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Harris|title=Lebanon: A History, 600-2011|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jY4ImTGnamUC&amp;pg=PP2|accessdate=7 April 2013|date=19 July 2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-518111-1|pages=274}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mikati succeeded [[Saad Hariri]], whose government was brought down by the resignation of ten of the alliance's ministers and one presidential appointee on 12 January 2011, resulting from the collapse of the Saudi-Syrian initiative to reach a compromise on the [[Special Tribunal for Lebanon]]. On 25 January, 68 members of the [[parliament of Lebanon]] voted in favor of nominating Mikati for Prime Minister. [[President of Lebanon]] [[Michel Suleiman]] then invited Mikati to head a new [[Government of Lebanon|Lebanese government]].

'''''Outsourced''''' is a  [[romantic comedy]] film, directed by [[John Jeffcoat]], released in 2006.

==Plot==
Todd Anderson ([[Josh Hamilton (actor)|Josh Hamilton]]) has to travel to India when his department is [[Outsourcing|outsourced]]. Todd is not happy but when his boss Dave informs him that quitting would mean losing his [[stock option]]s, he goes to train his Indian replacement Puro ([[Asif Basra]]).

When he arrives, Todd is frustrated with everything in the country where people call him "Mr. Toad". He has difficulty making the [[call center]] employees of [[Gharapuri]] understand what their American customers expect. He feels that he is never going to get the Minutes-per-Incident (MPI) under six minutes and so will never get to return to the USA.

Todd experiences the festival of [[Holi]] and with it, a sense of calm. At the call center the MPI slowly improves. He recognizes a leader in an employee Asha ([[Ayesha Dharker]]) and offers her the job of assisting Puro when Todd leaves. Todd tries to improve the workplace experience for the employees; when they tell him they would like some of the products they are selling, he decides to implement a rewards program and asks Dave for a shipment. Dave initially refuses, but when Todd manages to convince him that he is opening the products to a market of a billion people, Dave agrees to ship them overnight.

Asha realizes that the shipment has gone to another [[Gharapuri]], an island. They both reach the island and get the shipment, but the boat that was supposed to ferry them back catches fire. With no resort, they check into a hotel, where Asha accuses Todd of being frivolous with [[Kali]]. They argue but end up having sex. Upon their return Asha informs Todd that she has been engaged to a family friend named Ashok since she was four years old. She says their affair could be only a "[[Holiday in Goa]]", a term for a short time spent with a lover before marrying another. Todd is confused but accepts the situation.

One day, a [[dhobi|laundry man]] invites him to his home for lunch and gives him a [[pitha|rice flour cake]].

The call center MPI is at six when Dave calls to let Todd know that he needs to be picked up from the railway station. When Dave arrives, the power shuts down due to flooding, but the employees manage to set up their workstations on the roof and resume business. Dave is impressed, but when the employees go to the local bar to celebrate, Dave informs Todd the business is being shifted to China.

Todd informs the employees they have been fired, and Dave is erasing all data off their hard disks. Asha tells Todd that she has been writing a novel on her work computer called ''Holiday in Goa'' that needs to be saved. Todd gets the hint and they leave for Gaurav's (another employee's) house, where they spend time together. Todd refuses to go to China but suggests Puro as a replacement. Puro is seen leaving for China with his new wife.

Upon his return to the USA, Todd receives a phone call from Asha just as the screen turns black and the end credits roll.

==Production==
Principal photography took place in [[Mumbai]] from 5 February to 13 March 2006, followed by three days in Seattle from 7–9 April 2006. The film is based on an original screenplay by George Wing and writing partner, [[John Jeffcoat]].

[[File:Gambling table - Zensar (3630410644).jpg|thumb|The gamble of outsourcing - as demonstrated at an outsourcing summit in London in 2009]]
'''''Outsourcing''''' is "an agreement in which one company hires another company to be responsible for an existing internal activity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCarthy|first=Ian|last2=Anagnostou|first2=Angela|title=The impact of outsourcing on the transaction costs and boundaries of manufacturing|journal=International Journal of Production Economics|volume=88|issue=1|pages=61–71|doi=10.1016/s0925-5273(03)00183-x|year=2004|citeseerx=10.1.1.468.9139}}&lt;/ref&gt; It often involves the [[contract]]ing of a [[business process]] (e.g., payroll processing, claims processing), operational, and/or non-core functions, such as manufacturing, [[facility management]], [[call center]] support). The term "outsourcing" came from "outside resourcing" and dates back to at least 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED | outsourcing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OED | outsource}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outsourcing sometimes involves transferring employees and assets from one [[firm]] to another. Outsourcing is also the practice of [[Privatization|handing over control of public services to private enterprise]].&lt;ref&gt;Jamieson, Dave, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/01/afscme-public-interest-privatization_n_3530817.html "Public Interest Group Challenges Privatization Of Local, State Government Services"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211181510/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/01/afscme-public-interest-privatization_n_3530817.html |date=2013-12-11 }}, The Huffington Post, July 1, 2013.

Outsourcing includes both foreign and domestic contracting,&lt;ref name="Hira, Ron 2008"&gt;Hira, Ron, and Anil Hira. Outsourcing America: What's behind Our National Crisis and How We Can Reclaim American Jobs. New York: AMACOM, 2008. Print # 67-96.&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes includes [[offshoring]] (relocating a business function to a distant country)&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Paul. ''What's This India Business?: Offshoring, Outsourcing, and the Global Services Revolution''. London: Nicholas Brealey International, 2004. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[nearshoring]] (transferring a business process to a nearby country). Outsourcing is often confused with offshoring, however, they can be distinguished: a company can outsource (work with a service provider) and not offshore to a distant country. For example, in 2003 [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] outsourced their facilities' management support, but it did not involve offshoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/news/2012/07/09/11898/5-facts-about-overseas-outsourcing/|title=5 Facts About Overseas Outsourcing|date=2012-07-09|work=Center for American Progress|access-date=2018-05-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Financial savings from lower international labor rates can provide a major motivation for outsourcing or offshoring. There can be tremendous savings from lower international labor rates when offshoring.

In contrast, [[insourcing]] entails bringing processes handled by third-party firms in-house, and is sometimes accomplished via [[vertical integration]]. However, a business can provide a contract service to another organization without necessarily insourcing that business process.

==Overview==
Two organizations may enter into a contractual agreement involving an [[Financial transaction|exchange]] of [[Service (economics)|services]], expertise, and [[payments]]. Outsourcing is said to help firms to perform well in their core competencies, fuel innovation, and mitigate a shortage of skill or expertise in the areas where they want to outsource.&lt;ref&gt;Overby, S (2007) [http://www.cio.com/article/40380/ABC_An_Introduction_to_Outsourcing ABC: An Introduction to Outsourcing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630130752/http://www.cio.com/article/40380/ABC_An_Introduction_to_Outsourcing |date=2007-06-30 }}. CIO.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 21st century, businesses increasingly outsourced to suppliers outside their own country, sometimes referred to as offshoring or [[offshore outsourcing]]. Several related terms have emerged to refer to various aspects of the complex relationship between economic [[organizations]] or [[Business networking|networks]], such as [[nearshoring]], [[crowdsourcing]], [[multisourcing]],&lt;ref&gt;(Q4 2006)[http://www.btquarterly.com/?mc=mandatory-multisourcing-discipline&amp;page=ss-viewresearch Mandatory Multisourcing Discipline] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928142453/http://www.btquarterly.com/?mc=mandatory-multisourcing-discipline&amp;page=ss-viewresearch |date=2007-09-28 }} Business Trends Quarterly&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(2006) [http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/nov2006/gb20061108_738883.htm?chan=top+news_top+news+index_global+business Mandatory Multisourcing Discipline] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071119082031/http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/nov2006/gb20061108_738883.htm?chan=top+news_top+news+index_global+business |date=2007-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[strategic alliances]]/[[strategic partnerships]], strategic outsourcing.,&lt;ref&gt;see Holcomb &amp; Hitt, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and [[vested outsourcing]].

Outsourcing can offer greater budget flexibility and control. Outsourcing allows organizations to pay for the services and business functions they need, when they need them. It also reduces the need to hire and train specialized staff, brings in fresh [[engineering]] expertise, and can reduce capital, operating expenses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Olive|first=B|title=Outsourcing Growing, Despite Controversy|journal=Power|year=2004|pages=148(4), 19–20.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and risk.

"Do what you do best and outsource the rest" has become an internationally recognized business tagline first "coined and developed"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Haus|first1=Marian|title=Best 10 Peter Drucker quotes|url=http://pmseed.com/best-10-peter-drucker-quotes/|website=pmseed|publisher=pmseed|accessdate=26 April 2015|date=2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416043146/http://pmseed.com/best-10-peter-drucker-quotes/|archivedate=16 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1990s by the "legendary management consultant" [[Peter Drucker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vitasek|first1=Kate|title=A New way to Outsource|journal=Forbes|date=1 June 2011|url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/06/01/vested-outsourcing-microsoft-intel-leadership-managing-kate-vitasek.html|accessdate=26 April 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415132447/http://www.forbes.com/2010/06/01/vested-outsourcing-microsoft-intel-leadership-managing-kate-vitasek.html|archivedate=15 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The slogan was primarily used to advocate outsourcing as a viable business strategy. It has been said that Mr. Drucker began explaining the concept of "Outsourcing" as early as 1989 in his ''[[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]]'' article entitled "Sell the Mailroom."&lt;ref&gt;Drucker Peter F, (1989) "Sell the Mailroom," ''Wall Street Journal'', accessible at {{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB113202230063197204 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522111235/http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB113202230063197204 |archivedate=2015-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Outsourcing models ===
{{Expand section|date=August 2018}}
A serial report published in the 2010s looking at outsourcing models in [[clinical development]] described seven distinct models: Preferred Provider, Fee-for-Service, Functional Service Provider (FSP), Hybrid Full Service/FSP, In-Sourced, Compound/Program-based, and Sole-Source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|last=Miseta|first=Ed|date=August 20, 2018|title=Clinical Outsourcing Models: Still A Lot Of Churn And Uncertainty|url=https://www.clinicalleader.com/doc/clinical-outsourcing-models-still-a-lot-of-churn-and-uncertainty-0001|department=From the Editor|magazine=Clinical Leader|type=Interview of Andrew Schafer|publisher=VertMarkets, Inc.|doi=|pmid=|access-date=August 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reasons for outsourcing===
Companies primarily outsource to reduce certain costs, which may include peripheral or "non-core" business expenses,&lt;ref&gt;Forey, Gail, and Jane Lockwood. Globalization, Communication and the Workplace: Talking across the World. New York: Continuum, 2011. Electronic Book #21-26.&lt;/ref&gt; high taxes, high energy costs, excessive government regulation or mandates, and production or labor costs. The incentive to outsource may be greater for U.S. companies due to unusually high corporate taxes and mandated benefits like [[social security]], [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], and safety protection ([[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] regulations).&lt;ref&gt;Buchholz, Todd G. Bringing the Jobs Home: How the Left Created the Outsourcing Crisis&amp;nbsp;— and How We Can Fix It. New York: Sentinel, 2004. Print 97-118.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, it appears U.S. companies do not outsource to reduce executive or managerial costs. For instance, [[executive pay in the United States]] in 2007 was more than 400 times more than average workers—a gap 20 times bigger than it was in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, Albert R. "Letter From Washington: As U.S. rich-poor gap grows, so does public outcry" NY Times 2/18/2007&lt;/ref&gt; Other reasons include:
*Reducing and controlling operating costs.
*Improving company focus.
*Gaining access to world-class capabilities.
*Freeing internal resources for other purposes. 
*Streamlining or increasing efficiency for time-consuming functions. 
*Maximizing use of external resources.

===White-collar outsourcing===
Outsourcing of [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] work has grown rapidly since the early 21st century, despite a focus on manufacturing outsourcing. The [[digital workplace|digital workforce]] of countries like [[India]] and [[China]] are only paid a fraction of what would be [[minimum wage]] in the US. On average, [[software engineers]] are getting paid between 250,000 and 1,500,000 rupees (US$4,000 to US$23,000) in India as opposed to $40,000–$100,000 in countries such as the [[US]] and [[Canada]].&lt;ref name="Gillis"&gt;[http://search.proquest.com/docview/203549187 Gillis, A. (2001, Digital sweatshops. This, 34, 6-6.]&lt;/ref&gt; Outsourcing has also expanded to include many different countries; [[Costa Rica]] has become a big source for outsourcing work as it offers the advantage of a highly educated labor force, a large bilingual population, stable democratic government, shares similar time zones with the United States, and it takes only a few hours to travel between Costa Rica and the US. Companies such as Intel, Procter &amp; Gamble, HP, Gensler, Amazon and Bank of America have big operations in Costa Rica.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} In the recent years there has been an exponential growth in white collar work with service providers emerging in a wide range of activities, from banking and legal services to companies like Resources US,&lt;ref name="Resources US"&gt;[http://www.resourcesus.net Resources US pioneer in outsourcing services to US architecture firms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611173821/http://www.resourcesus.net/ |date=2016-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a pioneer in outsourcing services for architecture firms in United States. Unlike outsourced manufacturing, outsourced white collar work, offers workers the flexibility to choose their working hours, and which companies to work for. With many individuals [[telecommuting]] from home, the companies that require this type of work do not need to allocate additional funds for setting up of office space, management salary, and employee benefits as these individuals are [[independent contractor|contracted workers]].&lt;ref name="Ross"&gt;Ross, J; Irani, L; Silberman, M.S.; Zaldivar, A; Tomlinson, B (2010).

==Implications==

===For business===

====Management processes====
Globalization and complex [[supply chains]], along with greater physical distance between higher management and the production-floor employees often requires a change in management methodologies, as inspection and feedback may not be as direct and frequent as in internal processes. This often requires the assimilation of new communication methods such as [[voice over IP]], [[instant messaging]], and [[Issue tracking]] systems, new [[time management]] methods such as [[Comparison of time tracking software|time tracking software]], and new cost- and schedule-assessment tools such as [[Comparison of development estimation software|cost estimation software]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

====Communications and customer service====
In the area of [[call center]] outsourcing, organizations that are not experienced in working with outsourced call centers may suffer from lower end-user-experience as a result of outsourcing. This is exacerbated when outsourcing is combined with offshoring in regions where the first language and culture are different.&lt;ref&gt;Nadeem, S (2009) [http://nadeem.commons.gc.cuny.edu/files/2010/04/CS_Nadeem.pdf Macaulay's (Cyber) Children: The Cultural Politics of Outsourcing in India] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620105537/http://nadeem.commons.gc.cuny.edu/files/2010/04/CS_Nadeem.pdf |date=2010-06-20 }}. Cultural Sociology.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, foreign [[call center]] agents may speak with different [[linguistics|linguistic]] features such as [[Accent (dialect)|accents]], word use and phraseology, which may impede comprehension. The visual cues that are missing in a  [[telephone call]] may lead to misunderstandings and difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;Alster, N (2005) [http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/4390954/c_2984406/?f=archives Customer Disservice.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702092211/http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/4390954/c_2984406/?f=archives |date=2007-07-02 }} www.CFO.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Governance====
In 1979, Nobel laureate [[Oliver E. Williamson]] wrote that the governance structure is the "framework within which the integrity of a transaction is decided." Adding further that "because contracts are varied and complex, governance structures vary with the nature of the transaction."&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, Oliver E. (1979) "Transaction-Cost Economics: The Governance of Contractual Relations," Journal of Law and Economics: Vol. 22: No. 2, Article 3|accessible at: {{cite web |url=http://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/jle/vol22/iss2/3 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919093134/http://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/jle/vol22/iss2/3/ |archivedate=2016-09-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; University of Tennessee researchers have been studying complex outsourcing relationships since 2003. Emerging thinking regarding strategic outsourcing is focusing on creating a contract structure in which the parties have a vested interest in managing what are often highly complex business arrangements in a more collaborative, aligned, ﬂexible, and credible way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vitasek|first=Kate, et. al.|title=The Vested Outsourcing Manual|year=2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=0230112684|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;
(Also see [[relational contract]], [[governance]], [[Vested outsourcing]].)

====Security====
Before outsourcing, an organization is responsible for the actions of their entire staff, sometimes a substantial liability. When these same people are transferred to an outsource service provider, they may not even change desks. But their legal status changes. They are no longer directly employed by (and responsible to) the organization. This creates legal, security and compliance issues that are often addressed through the contract between the client and the suppliers. This is one of the most complex areas of outsourcing and sometimes involves a specialist third-party adviser.

Fraud is a specific security issue as well as criminal activity, whether it is by employees or the supplier staff. However, it can be disputed that fraud is more likely when outsourcing is involved. For example, in April 2005, a high-profile case involved the theft of $350,000 from four [[Citibank]] customers when call-center workers acquired the passwords to customer accounts and transferred the money to their own accounts opened under fictitious names. Citibank did not find out about the problem until the American customers noticed discrepancies with their accounts and notified the bank.&lt;ref&gt;Ribeiro, J (2005) [http://www.infoworld.com/article/2668975/application-development/indian-call-center-workers-charged-with-citibank-fraud.html Indian call center workers charged with Citibank fraud] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924042721/http://www.infoworld.com/article/2668975/application-development/indian-call-center-workers-charged-with-citibank-fraud.html |date=2015-09-24 }}. www.infoworld.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insourcing===
Outsourcing has gone through many iterations and reinventions. Some outsourcing contracts have been partially or fully reversed, citing an inability to execute strategy, lost transparency &amp; control, onerous contractual models, a lack of competition, recurring costs, hidden costs, and so on. Companies shifting to [[insourcing]] often cite the desire to increase control, compliance and to gain competitive differentiation through vertical integration or the development of shared services, commonly called a [[center of excellence]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Further, the label ''outsourcing'' has been found to be used for too many different kinds of exchanges often in confusing ways. For example, global software development, which often involves people working in different countries, cannot simply be called outsourcing. The outsourcing-based market model fails to explain why these development projects are jointly developed, and not simply bought and sold in the marketplace. Recently, a study has identified an additional system of governance, termed algocracy, which appears to govern global software projects alongside bureaucratic and market-based mechanisms. The study&lt;ref&gt;[[A. Aneesh|Aneesh]], A. Global Labor: Algocratic Modes of Organization, Sociological Theory 27:4 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; distinguishes code-based governance system from bureaucracy and the market, and underscores the prominent features of each organizational form in terms of its ruling mechanism: bureaucracy (legal-rational), the market (price), and algocracy (programming or algorithm). So, global software development projects, though not insourced, are not outsourced either. They are in-between, in a process that is sometimes termed "remote in-sourcing."&lt;ref&gt;BPM Watch: {{cite web |url=http://www.bpmwatch.com/columns/in-sourcing-a-closer-look-at-an-emerging-outsourcing-trend/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303212216/http://www.bpmwatch.com/columns/in-sourcing-a-closer-look-at-an-emerging-outsourcing-trend/ |archivedate=2013-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Projects are developed together where a common software platform allows different teams around the world to work on the same project together.

===Standpoint of labor===
From the standpoint of labor, outsourcing may represent a new threat, contributing to worker insecurity, and is reflective of the general process of [[globalization]] and [[Polarization (economics)|economic polarization]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Krugman|Krugman, Paul]] (2006). "Feeling No Pain." ''New York Times'', March 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 26, 2009, [[Jeff Immelt]], the CEO of [[General Electric]], called for the United States to increase its manufacturing base employment to 20% of the workforce, commenting that the U.S. has outsourced too much and can no longer rely on consumer spending to drive demand.&lt;ref name=Immelt&gt;Bailey, David and Soyoung Kim (June 26, 2009).[https://www.theguardian.com/business/feedarticle/8578904 GE's Immelt says U.S. economy needs industrial renewal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150611181851/http://www.theguardian.com/business/feedarticle/8578904 |date=2015-06-11 }}.''UK Guardian.''. Retrieved on June 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standpoint of government===
Western governments may attempt to compensate workers affected by outsourcing through various forms of legislation. In Europe, the [[Acquired Rights Directive]] attempts to address the issue. The Directive is implemented differently in different nations. In the United States, the [[Trade Adjustment Assistance]] Act is meant to provide compensation for workers directly affected by international trade agreements. Whether or not these policies provide the security and fair compensation they promise is debatable.

====Policy-making strategy====
A main feature of outsourcing influencing policy-making is the unpredictability it generates regarding the future of any particular sector or skill-group. The uncertainty of future conditions influences governance approaches to different aspects of long-term policies.

=====Competitiveness strategy=====
Economic growth requires change, therefore a governance disposed to helping social and economic structures adapt to the changing environment will facilitate growth and a stable transition to new economic structures&lt;ref name="Baldwin 2006"&gt;Baldwin, Richard. (2006). "Globalisation: the great unbludning(s)," Chapter 1, in Globalization Challenges for Europe, Secretariat of the Economic Council, Finnish Prime Minister's Office, Helsinki, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; until the economic structures become detrimental to the social, political and cultural structures.

In [[Developing country|developing countries]], policies that embrace the global phenomenon of outsourcing are a logical response to the ongoing movement towards "open markets" and "trade liberalization." Outsourcing, when interpreted as a trade phenomenon, complements trade liberalization strategies not only by promoting technological spillovers and capital inflows but also by offsetting the increasing levels of unemployment which result from opening up domestic markets. As prices adjust to those in the global market they no longer reflect domestic productivity, driving lower-productivity firms in the previously protected sectors out of business. Economic theorists argue that the resulting unemployment is only temporary as workers readjust and are eventually incorporated into the country's most productive sectors, namely those which enjoy a competitive edge over other players in the international market. Nonetheless, rapid liberalization of markets in developing countries has not maximized the productivity potential of the region. In the Global South, where technological development is drastically lower than in the North, the redeployment of human and capital resources into new export markets has not come at the cost of necessarily low-productivity sectors but rather underdeveloped ones. In other words, many of the previously protected sectors were not competitive yet on a global scale, not because they naturally lacked the comparative advantage, but because industry efficiency had not yet been reached.&lt;ref name="Stiglitz, J. And Charlton 2005"&gt;Stiglitz, J. And Charlton, A., (2005). "Trade can be Good for Development," Ch. 2 in Fair Trade for All, Oxford University Press, Oxford, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; In such cases where liberalization stunts the growth of potential industries, unemployment is a reflection of many underemployed resources.

Outsourcing fills in the gap of receding protected national industries, improving employment and living standards. Among other economic externalities, outsourcing promotes capital inflows and infrastructure. In Mexico, wage convergence was faster in cities where outsourcing first took hold through [[maquiladora]]s, along the [[Mexico–United States border]]. Studies suggest that for every 10% increase in US wages, northern cities in Mexico which are most influenced by outsourcing would experience wage rises of 2.5%, about 0.69% higher than in inner cities.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, G. (2003), "What Has Happened to Wages in Mexico Since NAFTA", NBER Working Paper Series, National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, MA.&lt;/ref&gt;

Corruption and reduced tax revenues after the signing of [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]] have limited the economic resources available to the Mexican government, thus explaining the difference in investment policies between Mexico and China.&lt;ref name="Stiglitz, J. And Charlton 2005" /&gt; Conversely, one of the successes of Asian countries in the twentieth century has been their promotion of higher rates of saving and investment. Studies suggest that the increase in capital input fueled the ‘Asian miracle’ rather than improvements in productivity and industrial efficiency. Though the previous conclusion suggests production conditions in the region remained static, the situation in East Asia experienced rapid transformations. Not only were national educational rates raised drastically, but there was also an increase in patenting and research and development expenditures. Rising levels of education, urbanization and even of patenting illustrate the active role of the government in advancing education as well as encouraging research and development.&lt;ref&gt;Krugman, P., Obtsfeld, M. And Melitz, M., (2012) "East Asia: Success and Crisis", in International Economics: Theory and Policy, Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Education strategy=====
Jobs become outsourced not based on the skill-level group it represents, but rather based on a variety of other factors including transportation cost of ideas, wage and labour productivity edge.&lt;ref name="Baldwin 2006"/&gt; Because of the overall uncertainty regarding the future dynamics of outsourcing it is not possible to predict the nature of labour demand in different regions. To better prepare the domestic workforce to future industry demands, therefore, national education programs ought to focus on flexibility and diversity of skills rather than on any specific task-oriented skills. Emphasis should go on preparing students both to succeed in non-habitual tasks and to adapt to changes in labour demands in the market.&lt;ref&gt;Blinder, A. (2006), "Offshoring: The Next Industrial Revolution?" Foreign Affairs, 85:2, 113.128&lt;/ref&gt; A specific goal that ought to be adopted is teaching students how to learn rather than teach them particular skills. This strategy would help students adapt to changing skill requirements in the future thus reducing friction from structural unemployment.&lt;ref name="Baldwin 2006"/&gt;

=====Welfare state strategy=====
The uncertainty regarding the domestic productivity edge renders caution a key element of governance to ensure a sustainable regional developmenloyed{{Neologism inline|date=May 2017}} re-enter the work force and smoothly transition into high-demand labour opportunities, potentially through re-training programs, the government{{Who|date=May 2017}} should also address the socioeconomic struggle and other welfare concerns of displaced employees.&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, Richard. (2006). "Globalisation: the great unbludning(s)," Chapter 1, in Globalization Challenges for Europe, Secretariat of the Economic Council, Finnish Prime Minister's Office, Helsinki, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Negative welfare effects of outsourcing have gathered substantial public attention. The possibility of outsourcing has internationalized labour markets which used to be local, opening up jobs which were traditionally non-traded to international competition. The resulting combination of lower wages and unemployment for certain jobs has driven the perceived ‘losers’ to engage in heated political debate.

Labour unions in the European Union have succeeded in pushing through protectionist policies in favour or lower-skilled groups throughout the 1970s and 1980s, including the Common Agricultural Policy on farming.&lt;ref name="Baldwin 2006" /&gt; Interest groups opposing outsourcing have been more active to voice their disapproval because the negative outcomes of the phenomenon are more concentrated on specific groups of people, namely those losing jobs to external competition, whereas the benefits from it become dissipated among the population at large. Overall lower prices and greater quality and variety of goods in domestic markets are some of the benefits of exploiting a country's comparative advantage through outsourcing.

Unlike the alleged ‘losers’ from outsourcing, those affected positively by it lack the motivation to organize to voice their support. There has been a wave of protectionism{{When|date=May 2017}} concerned with deep changes in the social structure allegedly imposed on the global system through globalization and outsourcing. The activists{{Who|date=May 2017}} see a readjustment of class systems and highlight an increased fracture in societies between the ‘haves’ and the ‘have-nots’ as different groups adjust to increasingly or decreasingly advantageous positions in the system of outsourcing. Opponents of outsourcing have also denounced it as a threat to local cultural integrity.

The argument on cultural disintegration points to the standardization of practices and norms as multinational corporations become involved with industries in regions culturally different from those in the country of origin. The alleged diffusion of culture has raised concern over the endurance of cultural norms and values, sociopolitical institutions and frameworks, or even cultural preferences and traditions in a context of increasing foreign presence.&lt;ref&gt;Rodrik, D., (2007), "Globalization for Whom", Ch. 9 in One Economics Many Recipes, Princeton University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Increased uncertainty regarding future socioeconomic security ought to be met with policies promoting equality and a fair redistribution of economic gains for a government to maintain its voters’ favour. Because of overall unpredictability, governments will likely need to reassure civilians that the burden of employment jobs resulting from outsourcing will be shared among taxpayers.&lt;ref name="Baldwin 2006" /&gt;

The fluctuations in employment levels are determined by the types of jobs which can be profitably outsourced or offshored. Domestic jobs become offshored or outsourced when lower productivity in other regions is compensated by lower wages, making outsourcing profitable even despite the added costs of transportation. The overall cost-effectiveness of the spatial unbundling of the industrial process thus depends on the cost of transporting specific services or ideas given the available technology. Because of these technological advancements such as the telecommunications revolution, air shipping or the Internet have deeply accelerated outsourcing and may continue to boost this process.

The future results of technological ingenuity and innovation are unknown, as are its potential impacts employment levels on any given task or job across regions.&lt;ref name="Baldwin 2006" /&gt; In the [[Global South]], policies attracting multinational corporations can help increase employment levels and promote growth. Governments that pursue these policies facilitate welfare protection given the context of increased unemployment in industries which cannot compete with the international market due to trade liberalization policies.&lt;ref name="Stiglitz, J. And Charlton 2005" /&gt;

=====Industrial policy=====
Outsourcing results from an internationalization of labor markets as more tasks become tradable. According to leading economist Greg Mankiw, the labour market functions under the same forces as the market of goods, with the underlying implication that the greater the number of tasks available to being moved, the better for efficiency under the gains from trade. With technological progress, more tasks can be offshored at different stages of the overall corporate process.&lt;ref&gt;Mankiw, G. and Swagel, P. (2005). "The Politics and Economics of Offshore Outsourcing," working paper for the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Environmental policy=====
There are widespread claims that outsourcing has pushed environmental standards down in developing regions as countries compete to attract foreign projects and investment. Similar to lower wages, lower health and environmental regulations contribute to giving a country a comparative advantage over another due to lower production costs. The controversy this raises, however, is that unlike wages, lower health or environmental standards does benefit the new employees joining the workforce.
Import competition has caused a de facto ‘race-to-the-bottom’ where countries lower environmental regulations to secure a competitive edge for their industries relative to other countries. As Mexico competes with China over Canadian and American markets, its national Commission for Environmental Cooperation has not been active in enacting or enforcing regulations to prevent environmental damage from increasingly industrialized Export Processing Zones. Similarly, since the signing of NAFTA heavy industries have increasingly moved to the US which has a comparative advantage due to its abundant presence of capital and well-developed technology. A further example of environmental de-regulation with the objective of protecting trade incentives have been the numerous exemptions to carbon taxes in European countries during the 1990s. The evidence suggests that even if outsourcing has promoted lower environmental protection, there are no intrinsic geographic implications that the Global South has been more negatively affected than the North. o Although outsourcing can influence environmental de-regulatory trends, the added cost of preventing pollution does not majorly determine trade flows or industrialization.&lt;ref&gt;Copeland, B. (2007), "Trade and the Environment: What do we do now", Ch. 39 in Handbook on International Trade Policy, ed. Kerr, W and Gaosford, J., Edward Elgar Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;

===Globalization and socio-economic implications===
{{Main|Globalization}}

====Global inequality and development====

=====Industrialization=====
Outsourcing has contributed to further levelling of global inequalities as it has led to general trends of industrialization in the Global South and deindustrialization in the Global North.

Even though outsourcing has promoted a movement of industrial sites from the Global North to Global South regions, it has not been the only reason for the concurrent deindustrialization and industrialization of the North and South respectively. Deindustrialization in more economically and technologically developed regions has also been affected by increased industrial productivity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Baldwin, Richard. (2006). "Globalisation: the great unbundling(s)," Chapter 1, in Globalization Challenges for Europe, Secretariat of the Economic Council, Finnish Prime Minister's Office, Helsinki, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise in industrial efficiency which characterized development in developed countries has occurred as a result of labor-saving technological improvements. Although these improvements do not directly reduce employment levels but rather increase output per unit of work, they can indirectly diminish the amount of labor required for fixed levels of output.&lt;ref&gt;Easterly, W. (2002), "Solow's Surprise: Investment is not the Key to Growth", Ch. 3 in The Elusive Quest for Growth, The MIT Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, a trending shift in demand towards non-tradable services such as those in the health-care or government sectors has further accelerated deindustrialization in the Global North. Since these tasks cannot be outsourced, the demand for them needs to be met domestically abiding by the local market price. Consequently, a shift in the labor force towards fulfilling these profitable services has mostly taken place at the expense of industry since the agricultural sector in the early industrializing Global North had already been maximizing its labour capacity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Despite the variety of domestic and international factors affecting deindustrialization in the Global North, those concerning the external influence of the global market have been the most influential ones since 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Rowthorn, R. and Coutts, K. ( 2004), "Deindustrialization and the balance of payments in advanced economies," UNCTAD Discussion Paper No.170&lt;/ref&gt;

The recent industrialization process outsourcing has encouraged in the Global South has taken place at a much faster pace than it did during its beginnings in the North, given that the well-developed technology was already developed, and merely spread to further regions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=====Growth and income=====
The almost simultaneous industrialization of the developing Global South and deindustrialization of the more developed Global North resulted in an international convergence of incomes.

Outsourcing has been characterized by rapid rates of growth and industrialization in the Global South. Conversely, the Global North has experienced a moderate slowdown in growth. Patterns of global industrialization and deindustrialization are explained by a combination of models in economic geography and economic growth. Models in economic geography illustrate that decreasing communication costs reduce the spatial clustering of industrial development. The lower cost to the spread of ideas improved coordination and communication within corporations across greater geographic distances. This process originated roughly after the international chaos of the World Wars, as a consequence of advancements in information technology during the 1960s. Further adaptations to technological progress, particularly the spread of the internet and liberalization of the telecommunications industry, permitted an acceleration of the movement of ideas and consequently of outsourcing since about the 1980s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=====Urbanization=====
The pace of urbanization in the Global North decreased considerably relative to its high levels following the Industrial Revolution. Rates of urban growth have been higher in the Global South.&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, Richard. (2006), "Globalisation: the great unbundling(s)," Chapter 1, in Globalization Challenges for Europe, Secretariat of the Economic Council, Finnish Prime Minister's Office, Helsinki, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

====Trade====
Outsourcing emerged with a new wave of globalization marked by high volumes of trade and capital flows. The increased movement of capital and goods contrasted starkly with the barriers and protectionism prevalent throughout the World Wars and the Great Depression during the Interwar Years.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

====Migration====
The level of migration has remained relatively low, particularly compared to the mass migratory trends which characterized the Industrial Revolution roughly between 1850 and 1914.,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; probably because labor markets are not free now. Countries now have discrimination labor laws, only allow people with citizenship cards live and work free in their territories, even getting a citizenship card is difficult for some one not born in their territory. Free labor markets, discrimination based with a person skills would help reduce outsourcing problems, letting people freely follow their jobs in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chang|first=Howard|title=Cultural Communities in a Global Labor Market: Immigration Restrictions as Residential Segregation|year=2007|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Law School|location=USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Domestic inequality====
Outsourcing in the Global North led to a rising divergence in domestic employment levels in different tasks within a given industry, making tackling unemployment more difficult for governments as job losses ceased to be primarily sectoral.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==By country==

===United States===
"Outsourcing" has become a continuing political issue in the United States, having been conflated with offshoring, during the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 U.S. presidential election]]. The political debate centered on outsourcing's consequences for the domestic U.S. workforce. [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] U.S. presidential candidate [[John Kerry]] criticized U.S. firms that outsource jobs abroad or that incorporate overseas in [[tax haven]]s to avoid paying their "fair share" of [[Taxation in the United States|U.S. taxes]] during his 2004 campaign, calling such firms "[[Benedict Arnold]] corporations".

Criticism of outsourcing, from the perspective of [[U.S. citizen]]s, generally revolves around the costs associated with transferring control of the labor process to an external entity in another country. A [[Zogby International]] poll conducted in August 2004 found that 71% of American voters believed that "outsourcing jobs overseas" hurt the economy while another 62% believed that the U.S. government should impose some legislative action against companies that transfer domestic jobs overseas, possibly in the form of increased taxes on companies that outsource.&lt;ref&gt;Zogby International survey results online at [http://www.zogby.com/news/2004/09/22/majority-of-americans-71-say-outsourcing-jobs-overseas-bad-for-us-economy-china-viewed-as-greatest-e/ zogby.com]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=KAP03 |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; One prediction (form 2010) claims that, by 2014, more than 1.3 million positions will disappear because of "the accelerated movement of work to India ..." and some other countries willing to accept outsourced jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Bonasia, J. (2010, December 03). Offshoring, for good or ill, comes of age putting India on the map competitive world markets demand outsourcing, but it does drain domestic jobs. Investor's Business Daily. A04.&lt;/ref&gt; President Obama promoted an act titled '[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/s3364 Bring Jobs Home Act]' that would help reshore jobs by giving incentives such as a tax cut or a 20 percent tax credit for moving operations back to the USA.&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Documents and Publications. (2012, May 16). Brown outlines "Bring Jogs Home Act" aim at encouraging business to bring hobs back to the U.S. 2012 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; The same bill was reintroduced in the [[113th United States Congress]] as the [[Bring Jobs Home Act (S. 2569; 113th Congress)]].&lt;ref name=PoliticoBorrowedTime&gt;{{cite news|last1=Everett|first1=Burgess|title=Borrowed time: Tale of a Walsh bill|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/07/john-walsh-bring-jobs-home-act-bill-109307.html|accessdate=25 July 2014|publisher=Politico|date=23 July 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140724223856/http://www.politico.com/story/2014/07/john-walsh-bring-jobs-home-act-bill-109307.html|archivedate=24 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=2569sum&gt;{{cite web|title=S. 2569 - Summary|url=https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/2569|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=25 July 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728161506/https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/2569|archivedate=28 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Labor advocates accuse [[union busting]] as one possible cause of outsourcing. They argue that as unions are disadvantaged by union busting legislation, workers lose bargaining power and it becomes easier for corporations to fire them and ship their job overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another rationale is the high corporate income tax rate in the U.S. relative to other OECD nations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.taxfoundation.org/news/show/1466.html |title=U.S. Lagging Behind OECD Corporate Tax Trends |publisher=The Tax Foundation |date=2006-05-05 |accessdate=2010-03-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706032603/http://www.taxfoundation.org/news/show/1466.html |archivedate=2009-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=John |last=Tamny |url=http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ODZjNjI4ZTNjZmNiOGMxYjAwOTg1ZGI0NmFiOWFjZjI= |title=John Tamny on Hillary Clinton Economics on NRO Financial |publisher=Article.nationalreview.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109171714/http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ODZjNjI4ZTNjZmNiOGMxYjAwOTg1ZGI0NmFiOWFjZjI= |archivedate=2009-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update inline|date=June 2018}} and the practice of taxing revenues earned outside of U.S. jurisdiction, a very uncommon practice. However, outsourcing is not solely a U.S. phenomenon as corporations in various nations with low tax rates outsource as well, which means that high taxation can only partially, if at all, explain US outsourcing. For example, the amount of corporate outsourcing in 1950 would be considerably lower than today,{{when|date=June 2018}} yet the tax rate was actually higher in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url         = http://www.cbpp.org/files/10-16-03tax.pdf

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also suggested that lowering the corporate income tax and ending the double-taxation of foreign-derived revenue (taxed once in the nation where the revenue was raised, and once from the U.S.) will alleviate corporate outsourcing and make the U.S. more attractive to foreign companies. However, while the US has a high official tax rate, the actual taxes paid by US corporations may be considerably lower due to the use of tax loopholes, tax havens, and "gaming the system".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smartmoney.com/investing/economy/high-corporate-tax-rate-is-misleading-22463/ |title=High Corporate Tax Rate Is Misleading at |publisher=Smartmoney.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210200332/http://www.smartmoney.com/investing/economy/high-corporate-tax-rate-is-misleading-22463/ |archivedate=2010-02-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than avoiding taxes, outsourcing may be mostly driven by the desire to lower labor costs (see standpoint of labor above). [[Sarbanes-Oxley]] has also been cited as a factor for corporate flight from U.S. jurisdiction.

===European Union===
Where outsourcing involves the transfer of an undertaking, it is subject to Council Directive 77/187 of 14 February 1977, on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the safeguarding of employees’ rights in the event of transfers of undertakings, businesses or parts of businesses (as amended by Directive 98/50/EC of 29 June 1998; consolidated in Directive 2001/23 of 12 March 2001). Under that directive, rights acquired by employees with the former employer are to be safeguarded when they, together with the undertaking in which they are employed, are transferred to another employer, i.e., the contractor. An example of a case involving such contracting-out was the decision of the European Court of Justice in Christel Schmidt v. Spar- und Leihkasse der früheren Ämter Bordesholm, Kiel und Cronshagen, Case C-392/92 [1994]. Although subsequent decisions have disputed whether a particular contracting-out exercise constituted a transfer of an undertaking (see, for example, [[Süzen v Zehnacker Gebaeudereingung GmbH|Ayse Süzen v. Zehnacker Gebäudereinigung GmbH Krankenhausservice]], Case C-13/95 [1997]), in principle, employees of an enterprise outsourcing part of its activities in which they are employed may benefit from the protection offered by the directive.

Seeking to implement the cost-cutting solutions, many Western European firms have been transferring tech projects eastward. For example, Deutsche Bank has some of its software developed in Ukraine, Siemens possess R&amp;D center in Romania. Europe Outsourcing has produced outstanding results and henceforward they are increasing them in numbers.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Despite unfavorable economic conditions from 2007 to 2009, the outsourcing services market continued to flourish in Central and Eastern European. In 2008 when the inflow of investment in Western Europe was down by 48%, it fell by only 9% in Central and Eastern Europe. In [[Poland]] alone, during 2009, the year following the global economic downturn, approximately 10,000 jobs were created in [[business process outsourcing]] (BPO).{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Co-sourcing==
'''Co-sourcing''' is a business practice where a service is performed by staff from inside an organization and also by an external service provider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hreonline.com/HRE/story.jsp?storyId=80237620 | title='Co-Sourcing' and More | publisher=hreonline.com | date=March 16, 2008 | accessdate=May 23, 2012 | author=McIlvaine, Andrew R. | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513092203/http://www.hreonline.com/HRE/story.jsp?storyId=80237620 | archivedate=May 13, 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/6502924 | title=Out With 'Outsourcing' And In With 'Co-Sourcing' | publisher=informationweek.com | date=September 2, 2002 | accessdate=May 23, 2012 | author=Khirallah, Diane Rezendes}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be a service performed in concert with a [[customer|client]]'s existing internal [[audit]] department. The scope of work may focus on one or more aspects of the [[internal audit]] function. Co-sourcing can serve to minimize sourcing risks, increase transparency, clarity and lend toward better control over the processes outsourced.&lt;ref&gt;Business Dictionary: {{cite web |url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/co-sourcing.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819235940/http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/co-sourcing.html |archivedate=2016-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of co-sourcing services are supplementing the in-house internal audit staff with specialized skills such as information [[risk management]] or integrity services, providing routine assistance to in-house auditing for operations and control evaluations in peak period activity and conducting special projects such as fraud investigation or plant investment appraisals. Another example of co-sourcing is outsourcing part of [[software development]] or [[software maintenance]] activities to an external [[organization]], while keeping part of the development in-house. Other internal business activities such as [[Human Resources|HR]] and administrative tasks can also be co-sourced by [[Professional Employer Organization|employee leasing]] companies.

===Identity management co-sourcing===
It is an approach to enterprise [[identity management]] in which the identity service interacts directly or through some technical footprint with an organization's [[Information Technology]] (IT) identity back-end infrastructure: [[directory service|directories]], [[database]]s, and other identity repositories. The organization and the external service provider typically have a shared responsibility for building, hosting and operating the identity service. The balance of this responsibility can vary depending on the service levels required, and span from an all on-premises deployment, where the identity service is built, hosted and operated within the organization's [[IT infrastructure]] and managed on-premises by the external service provider. This contrasts with an "all in-the-cloud" service scenario, where the identity service is built, hosted and operated by the service provider in an externally hosted, [[cloud computing]] infrastructure.

==Counterwave outsourcing==
Some firms have reversed the decision to outsource because the results were not entirely as expected. The circumstances which allow firms to unbundle the different tasks or stages of its manufacturing process into different locations have not been fully determined. Though the nature of the tasks plays a role determining their interconnectedness, other factors such as innovation in the manufacturing process or advances in transport and communication technology also affect the need for direct contact among employees. As the process which ties tasks together within firms remains unclear, there is a degree of uncertainty about which tasks need to remain geographically clustered together. In many cases firms took risks experimenting with outsourcing while lacking a firm understanding of the relationship among internal tasks and its spatial implications.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Despite saving money, companies have often faced unexpected drawbacks from outsourcing, such as miscommunication or lower quality of intermediate products, which end up delaying the overall production process. Another reason for a decrease in outsourcing is that many jobs that were subcontracted abroad have been replaced by technological advances.&lt;ref name="economist.com"/&gt;

According to a Deloitte Consulting survey carried out in 2005, a quarter of the companies which had outsourced tasks reversed their strategy. Many big companies like Lenovo considered turning around outsourcing strategies of outsourcing.&lt;ref name="economist.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21569572-after-decades-sending-work-across-world-companies-are-rethinking-their-offshoring|title=Here, There and Everywhere|publisher=''[[The Economist]] [London] n.d.: n. pag.|date=17 January 2013|accessdate=19 January 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118202607/http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21569572-after-decades-sending-work-across-world-companies-are-rethinking-their-offshoring|archivedate=18 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public opinion in the US and other Western powers opposing outsourcing was particularly strengthened by the drastic increase in unemployment as a result of the 2007-2008 financial crisis. In the first decade from 2000 to 2010, the US experienced a net loss of 687,000 jobs due to outsourcing, primarily in the computers and electronics sector. Public disenchantment with outsourcing has not only stirred political responses, as seen in the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 US presidential campaigns]], but it has also made companies more reluctant to outsource or offshore jobs.&lt;ref name="economist.com"/&gt;

A 2016 Deloitte survey suggested that companies are no longer reluctant to outsource.&lt;ref&gt;"Outsourcing accelerates forward," (2016) Deloitte 2016 Global Outsourcing Survey accessed 18 August 2016 at {{cite web |url=http://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/process-and-operations/us-cons-sdt-gos-exec-summary-2016.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170112100552/https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/process-and-operations/us-cons-sdt-gos-exec-summary-2016.pdf |archivedate=2017-01-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Deloitte's survey identified three trends: 
*Companies are broadening their approach to outsourcing as they begin to view it as more than a simple cost-cutting play
*Organizations are "redefining the ways they enter into outsourcing relationships and manage the ensuing risks."  
*Organizations are changing the way they are managing their relationships with outsourcing providers to "maximize the value of those relationships."

The '''''Pentagon Papers''''', officially titled '''''Report of the Office of the Secretary of Defense Vietnam Task Force''''', is a [[United States Department of Defense]] history of the United States' political and military involvement in [[Vietnam]] from 1945 to 1967. The papers were released by [[Daniel Ellsberg]], who had worked on the study; they were first brought to the attention of the public on the front page of ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1971.&lt;ref name=upi1971yearinreview&gt;{{cite news| title=The Pentagon Papers|publisher=[[United Press International|United Press International (UPI)]]|year=1971|url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1971/The-Pentagon-Papers/12295509436546-7/|accessdate=2010-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Sheehan|first=Neil|authorlink=Neil Sheehan|title=Vietnam Archive: Pentagon Study Traces 3 Decades of Growing U.S. Involvement|newspaper= The New York Times|date=1971-06-13|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/06/13/archives/vietnam-archive-pentagon-study-traces-3-decades-of-growing-u-s.html|accessdate=2015-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1996 article in ''The New York Times'' said that the ''Pentagon Papers'' had demonstrated, among other things, that the [[Presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson|Johnson Administration]] "systematically lied, not only to the public but also to Congress".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Apple|first=R.W.|authorlink=R. W.

More specifically, the papers revealed that the U.S. had secretly enlarged the scope of its actions in the [[Vietnam War]] with the [[Operation Menu|bombings]] of nearby [[Cambodia]] and [[Laos]], coastal raids on [[North Vietnam]], and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] attacks, none of which were reported in the mainstream media.&lt;ref name="'70s 43"/&gt;

For his disclosure of the ''Pentagon Papers'', Ellsberg was initially charged with conspiracy, espionage, and theft of government property, but the charges were later dismissed after prosecutors investigating the [[Watergate scandal]] discovered that the staff members in the [[Nixon White House]] had ordered the so-called [[White House Plumbers]] to engage in unlawful efforts to discredit Ellsberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Watergate Story|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/watergate/timeline.html|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=October 26, 2013|quote=Watergate prosecutors find a memo addressed to [[John Ehrlichman]] describing in detail the plans to burglarize the office of Pentagon Papers defendant Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist, ''The Post'' reports.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://movies2.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/0511.html |title=Pentagon Papers Charges Are Dismissed; Judge Byrne Frees Ellsberg and Russo, Assails 'Improper Government Conduct' |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 11, 1973 |accessdate=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ime Magazine Pentagon Papers.jpg|thumb|Shortly after their release in June 1971, the ''Pentagon Papers'' were featured on the cover of [[Time (magazine)|''TIME'' magazine]] for revealing "The Secret War" of the United States in Vietnam.]]

[[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara]] created the Vietnam Study Task Force on June 17, 1967, for the purpose of writing an "encyclopedic history of the [[Vietnam War]]".&lt;ref name="rmcn 280" /&gt; McNamara claimed that he wanted to leave a written record for historians, to prevent policy errors in future administrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McNamara|1996|p=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; McNamara neglected to inform either President [[Lyndon Johnson]] or Secretary of State [[Dean Rusk]] about the study.&lt;ref name="rmcn 280" /&gt; One report claimed that McNamara planned to give the work to his friend [[Robert F. Kennedy]], who sought the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1968|Democratic presidential nomination in 1968]].&lt;ref name="correll200702" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rmcn 282"&gt;{{harvnb|McNamara|1996|p=282}}&lt;/ref&gt; McNamara later denied this, although he admitted that he should have informed Johnson and Rusk.&lt;ref name="rmcn 282" /&gt;

Instead of using existing Defense Department historians, McNamara assigned his close aide and [[Assistant Secretary of Defense]] [[John T. McNaughton]] to collect the papers.&lt;ref name="rmcn 280"&gt;{{harvnb|McNamara|1996|p=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; McNaughton died in a [[Piedmont Airlines Flight 22|plane crash]] one month after work began in June 1967, but the project continued under the direction of Defense Department official [[Leslie H. Gelb]].&lt;ref name="rmcn 280" /&gt; Thirty-six analysts—half of them active-duty military officers, the rest academics and civilian federal employees—worked on the study.&lt;ref name="rmcn 280" /&gt; The analysts largely used existing files in the [[Office of the Secretary of Defense]]. In order to keep the study secret from others, including [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[Walt W. Rostow]], they conducted no interviews or consultations with the armed forces, with the White House, or with other federal agencies.&lt;ref name="correll200702" /&gt;

McNamara left the Defense Department in February 1968, and his successor [[Clark M. Clifford]] received the finished study on January 15, 1969, five days before [[Richard Nixon]]'s inauguration, although Clifford claimed he never read it. The study consisted of 3,000 pages of historical analysis and 4,000 pages of original government documents in 47 volumes, and was classified as "Top Secret – Sensitive". ("Sensitive" is not an [[Classified information in the United States|official security designation]]; it meant that access to the study should be controlled.) The task force published 15 copies; the think tank [[RAND Corporation]] received two of the copies from Gelb, [[Morton Halperin]] and [[Paul Warnke]], with access granted if at least two of the three approved.&lt;ref name="correll200702"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Correll |first=John T. |url=http://www.airforcemag.com/MagazineArchive/Pages/2007/February%202007/0207pentagon.aspx |title=The Pentagon Papers |format= |work=Air Force Magazine |date=February 2007|accessdate=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Correll |first=John T. |url=http://www.airforcemag.com/MagazineArchive/Documents/2007/February%202007/0207pentagon.pdf |title=The Pentagon Papers |format=pdf |work=Air Force Magazine |date=February 2007|accessdate=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Actual objective of the Vietnam War: Containment of China ===
{{Main|China containment policy}}

[[File:Containment of China.jpg|700px|thumb|As laid out by U.S. Secretary of Defense [[Robert McNamara]], the [[China containment policy|Chinese containment policy]] of the United States was a long-run strategic effort to surround [[Beijing]] with the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], its [[satellite state]]s, as well as:
&lt;br /&gt;
a) The [[Japan]]–[[Korea]] front,
&lt;br /&gt;
b) The [[India]]–[[Pakistan]] front, and
&lt;br /&gt;
c) The [[Southeast Asia]] front]]

Although President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] stated that the aim of the Vietnam War was to secure an "independent, non-Communist [[South Vietnam]]", a January 1965 memorandum by Secretary of Defense [[Robert McNamara]] stated that an underlying justification was "not to help a friend, but to contain China".&lt;ref name="cnnpentagonpapers"&gt;{{cite web|title=COVER STORY: Pentagon Papers: The Secret War|url=http://edition.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/analysis/back.time/9606/28/index.shtml|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=June 28, 1971|accessdate=October 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/printout/0,8816,905234,00.html |title=The Nation: Pentagon Papers: The Secret War |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=June 28, 1971 |accessdate=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 3, 1965, McNamara sent a memorandum to President Johnson, in which he explained the "major policy decisions with respect to our course of action in Vietnam". The memorandum begins by disclosing the rationale behind the bombing of North Vietnam in February 1965:

{{quote|The February decision to bomb North Vietnam and the July approval of Phase I deployments make sense only if they are in support of a long-run United States policy to contain [[China]].&lt;ref name="mcnamarachina"&gt;{{cite web|last=[[Robert McNamara]]|title=Draft Memorandum From Secretary of Defense McNamara to President Johnson|url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v03/d189|publisher=[[Office of the Historian]]|date=November 3, 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

McNamara accused China of harboring [[imperialism|imperial]] aspirations like those of [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Imperial Japan]]. According to McNamara, the Chinese were conspiring to "organize all of Asia" against the United States:

{{quote|China—like Germany in 1917, like Germany in the West and Japan in the East in the late 30s, and like the USSR in 1947—looms as a major power threatening to undercut our importance and effectiveness in the world and, more remotely but more menacingly, to organize all of Asia against us.&lt;ref name="mcnamarachina" /&gt;}}

To encircle the Chinese, the United States aimed to establish "three fronts" as part of a "long-run effort to contain China":

{{quote|There are three fronts to a long-run effort to contain China (realizing that the USSR "contains" China on the north and northwest):

(a) the Japan–Korea front;

(b) the India–Pakistan front; and

(c) the [[Southeast Asia]] front.&lt;ref name="mcnamarachina" /&gt;}}

However, McNamara admitted that the [[China containment policy|containment of China]] would ultimately sacrifice a significant amount of America's time, money and lives.&lt;ref name="mcnamarachina" /&gt;

Years before the August 2, 1964 [[Gulf of Tonkin incident]] occurred, the U.S. government was indirectly or directly involved in Vietnam's affairs:
* Under President [[Harry S. Truman]], the U.S. government aided [[French Indochina|France]] in its war against the communist-led [[Viet Minh]] during the [[First Indochina War]].&lt;ref name="nytimespen1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sheehan|first=Neil|authorlink=Neil Sheehan|title=Vietnam Archive: Pentagon Study Traces 3 Decades of Growing U.S. Involvement|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/04/13/reviews/papers-overview.html|work=The New York Times|date=June 13, 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Under President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], the U.S. government played a "direct role in the ultimate breakdown of the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva settlement]]" in 1954 by supporting the fledgling South Vietnam and covertly undermining the communist country of North Vietnam.&lt;ref name="nytimespen1" /&gt;
* Under President [[John F. Kennedy]], the U.S. government transformed its policy towards Vietnam from a limited "gamble" to a broad "commitment".&lt;ref name="nytimespen1" /&gt;
* Under President Lyndon B. Johnson, the U.S. government began waging covert military operations against communist North Vietnam in defense of South Vietnam.&lt;ref name="nytimespen1" /&gt;

==== Role of the United States in the rise of President Diem ====
[[File:Ngo Dinh Diem at Washington - ARC 542189.jpg|thumb|right|U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] greets South Vietnam's President [[Ngo Dinh Diem]], whose rise to power was backed by the United States, according to the ''Pentagon Papers'']]

In a section of the ''Pentagon Papers'' titled "Kennedy Commitments and Programs," America's commitment to [[South Vietnam]] was attributed to the creation of the country by the United States. As acknowledged by the papers:

{{quote|We must note that South Vietnam (unlike any of the other countries in Southeast Asia) was essentially the creation of the United States.&lt;ref name="nara1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Evolution of the War. Counterinsurgency: The Kennedy Commitments and Programs, 1961|url=http://media.nara.gov/research/pentagon-papers/Pentagon-Papers-Part-IV-B-1.pdf|publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]]|accessdate=October 28, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130809120534/http://media.nara.gov/research/pentagon-papers/Pentagon-Papers-Part-IV-B-1.pdf|archive-date=August 9, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

In a sub-section titled "Special American Commitment to Vietnam", the papers emphasized once again the role played by the United States:

{{quote
|
* "Without U.S. support [[Ngo Dinh Diem|[Ngo Dinh] Diem]] almost certainly could not have consolidated his hold on the South during 1955 and 1956."
* "Without the threat of U.S. intervention, South Vietnam could not have refused to even discuss the elections called for in 1956 under the Geneva settlement without being immediately overrun by the Viet Minh armies."
* "Without U.S. aid in the years following, the Diem regime certainly, and an independent South Vietnam almost as certainly, could not have survived".&lt;ref name="nara1" /&gt;}}

More specifically, the United States sent US$28.4 million worth of equipment and supplies to help the Diem regime strengthen its army. In addition, 32,000 men from [[South Vietnamese Popular Force|South Vietnam's Civil Guard]] were trained by the United States at a cost of US$12.7 million. It was hoped that Diem's regime, after receiving a significant amount of U.S. assistance, would be able to withstand the [[Viet Cong]].&lt;ref name="nara1" /&gt;

The papers identified General [[Edward Lansdale]], who served in the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS) and worked for the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), as a "key figure" in the establishment of Ngo Dinh Diem as the President of South Vietnam, and the backing of Diem's regime thereafter. As written by Lansdale in a 1961 memorandum: "We (the U.S.) must support Ngo Dinh Diem until another strong executive can replace him legally."&lt;ref name="nara1" /&gt;

==== Role of the United States in the overthrow of Diem's regime ====
[[File:Corpse of Ngô Đình Diệm in the 1963 coup.jpg|The body of President Diệm after he was assassinated in the [[1963 South Vietnamese coup]], which was backed by the United States government|right|thumb|200px]]

According to the ''Pentagon Papers'', the U.S. government played a key role in the [[1963 South Vietnamese coup]], in which President Ngo Dinh Diem was assassinated. While maintaining "clandestine contact" with Vietnamese generals planning a coup, the U.S. cut off its aid to President Diem and openly supported a successor government in what the authors called an "essentially leaderless Vietnam":

{{quote|For the military [[coup d'etat]] against Ngo Dinh Diem, the U.S. must accept its full share of responsibility. Beginning in August 1963 we variously authorized, sanctioned and encouraged the coup efforts of the Vietnamese generals and offered full support for a successor government.

In October we cut off aid to Diem in a direct rebuff, giving a green light to the generals. We maintained clandestine contact with them throughout the planning and execution of the coup and sought to review their operational plans and proposed new government.

Thus, as the nine-year rule of Diem came to a bloody end, our complicity in his overthrow heightened our responsibilities and our commitment in an essentially leaderless Vietnam.&lt;ref name="PP2-4-201"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.nara.gov/research/pentagon-papers/Pentagon-Papers-Part-IV-B-5.pdf |title=The Pentagon Papers, Vol. 2, Chapter 4, "The Overthrow of Ngo Dinh Diem, May-November, 1963" |publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]] |date= |accessdate=2013-10-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130809132314/http://media.nara.gov/research/pentagon-papers/Pentagon-Papers-Part-IV-B-5.pdf |archive-date=2013-08-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As early as August 23, 1963, an unnamed U.S. representative had met with Vietnamese generals planning a coup against President Diem.&lt;ref name="PP2-4-201" /&gt; According to ''The New York Times'', this U.S. representative was later identified to be CIA agent [[Lucien Conein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Tim Weiner|title=Lucien Conein, 79, Legendary Cold War Spy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/07/world/lucien-conein-79-legendary-cold-war-spy.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 7, 1998|quote=He ran agents behind the Iron Curtain in the early 1950's. He was the C.I.A.'s contact with friendly generals in Vietnam as the long war took shape there. He was the man through whom the United States gave the generals tacit approval as they planned the assassination of South Vietnam's President, Ngo Dinh Diem, in November 1963.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Proposed operations ===
The [[Director of Central Intelligence]], [[John A. McCone]], proposed the following categories of military action:
* Category 1 – Air raids on major [[Viet Cong]] supply centers, conducted simultaneously by [[Republic of Vietnam Air Force|South Vietnam's air force]] and the United States Air Force (codenamed [[Farm Gate (military operation)|Farmgate]])&lt;ref name=statepentagon&gt;{{cite web|last=John A. McCone|title=Probable Communist Reactions to Certain US or US-Sponsored Courses of Action in Vietnam and Laos|url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v01/d253|publisher=[[Office of the Historian]]|accessdate=October 26, 2013|date=July 28, 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Category 2 – Cross-border raids on major [[Viet Cong]] supply centers, conducted by South Vietnamese units and US military advisors.&lt;ref name=statepentagon /&gt;
* Category 3 – Limited air strikes on North Vietnamese targets by unmarked planes flown exclusively by non-US aircrews.&lt;ref name=statepentagon /&gt;

However, McCone did not believe these military actions alone could lead to an escalation of the situation because the "fear of escalation would probably restrain the Communists".&lt;ref name=statepentagon /&gt; In a memorandum addressed to President [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Johnson]] on July 28, 1964, McCone explained:

{{quote|In response to the first or second categories of action, local Communist military forces in the areas of actual attack would react vigorously, but we believe that none of the Communist powers involved would respond with major military moves designed to change the nature of the conflict...

Air strikes on North Vietnam itself (Category 3) would evoke sharper Communist reactions than air strikes confined to targets in Laos, but even in this case fear of escalation would probably restrain the Communists from a major military response...&lt;ref name=statepentagon /&gt;}}

Barely a month after the Gulf of Tonkin incident on August 2, 1964, National Security Advisor [[McGeorge Bundy]] warned that further provocations should not be undertaken until October, when the government of South Vietnam (GVN) would become fully prepared for a full-scale war against North Vietnam. In a memorandum addressed to President Johnson on September 8, 1964, Bundy wrote:

{{quote|The main further question is the extent to which we should add elements to the above actions that would tend deliberately to provoke a [[North Vietnam|DRV]] reaction, and consequent retaliation by us.

Examples of actions to be considered were running US naval patrols increasingly close to the North Vietnamese coast and/or [''[[sic]]''] associating them with [[Operation 34A|34A operations]].

We believe such deliberately provocative elements should not be added in the immediate future while the GVN is still struggling to its feet. By early October, however, we may recommend such actions depending on GVN progress and Communist reaction in the meantime, especially to US naval patrols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=[[McGeorge Bundy]]|title=Courses of action for South Vietnam|url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v01/d342|publisher=[[Office of the Historian]]|accessdate=October 26, 2013|date=September 8, 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While maritime operations played a key role in the provocation of North Vietnam, U.S. military officials had initially proposed to fly a [[Lockheed U-2]] reconnaissance aircraft over the country, but this was to be replaced by other plans.&lt;ref name="cnnpentagonpapers" /&gt;

==Leak==
Daniel Ellsberg knew the leaders of the task force well. He had worked as an aide to McNaughton from 1964 to 1965, had worked on the study for several months in 1967, and Gelb and Halperin approved his access to the work at RAND in 1969.{{r|correll200702}} Now opposing the war, Ellsberg and his friend [[Anthony Russo (whistleblower)|Anthony Russo]]&lt;ref name="ellsberg20080807"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.antiwar.com/blog/2008/08/07/ellsberg-remembering-anthony-russo/ | title=Ellsberg: Remembering Anthony Russo | publisher=Antiwar.com | date=2008-08-07 | accessdate=April 17, 2011 | last=Ellsberg |first=Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt; photocopied the study in October 1969 intending to disclose it. Ellsberg approached Nixon's National Security Advisor [[Henry Kissinger]], Senators [[William Fulbright]] and [[George McGovern]], and others, but none were interested.&lt;ref name="correll200702"/&gt;

In February 1971, Ellsberg discussed the study with ''The New York Times'' reporter [[Neil Sheehan]], and gave 43 of the volumes to him in March. Before publication, ''The New York Times'' sought legal advice. The paper's regular outside counsel, [[Lord Day &amp; Lord]], advised against publication,&lt;ref name="correll200702"/&gt; but in-house counsel [[James Goodale]] prevailed with his argument that the press had a [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] right to publish information significant to the people's understanding of their government's policy.

''The New York Times'' began publishing excerpts on June 13, 1971; the first article in the series was titled "Vietnam Archive: Pentagon Study Traces Three Decades of Growing US Involvement". The study was dubbed ''The Pentagon Papers'' during the resulting media publicity.&lt;ref name="correll200702"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to the Court Opinion on The New York Times Co. v. United States Case|url=http://usinfo.state.gov/usa/infousa/facts/democrac/48.htm|accessdate=2005-12-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051204121721/https://usinfo.state.gov/usa/infousa/facts/democrac/48.htm|archivedate=2005-12-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Street protests, political controversy, and lawsuits followed.

To ensure the possibility of public debate about the papers' content, on June 29, [[United States Senate|US Senator]] [[Mike Gravel]], an Alaska Democrat, entered 4,100 pages of the papers into the record of his Subcommittee on Public Buildings and Grounds. These portions of the papers, which were edited for Gravel by [[Howard Zinn]] and [[Noam Chomsky]], were subsequently published by [[Beacon Press]], the publishing arm of the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] of Congregations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pentagon Papers, Senator Mike Gravel edition, Beacon Press|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/248181?tab=editions}}&lt;/ref&gt; A federal [[grand jury]] was subsequently empaneled to investigate possible violations of federal law in the release of the report. Leonard Rodberg, a Gravel aide, was [[subpoena]]ed to testify about his role in obtaining and arranging for publication of the ''Pentagon Papers''. Gravel asked the court (in ''[[Gravel v. United States]]'') to quash the subpoena on the basis of the [[Speech or Debate Clause]] in [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article I, Section 6]] of the [[United States Constitution]].

That clause provides that "for any Speech or Debate in either House, [a Senator or Representative] shall not be questioned in any other Place", meaning that Gravel could not be prosecuted for anything said on the Senate floor, and, by extension, for anything entered to the ''Congressional Record'', allowing the papers to be publicly read without threat of a [[treason]] trial and conviction. When Gravel's request was reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court, the Court denied the request to extend this protection to Gravel or his legislative aide, Leonard Rodberg, because the grand jury subpoena served on them related to a third party rather than any act they themselves committed for the preparation of materials later entered into the Congressional Record. Nevertheless, the grand jury investigation was halted, and the publication of the papers was never prosecuted.

Later, Ellsberg said the documents "demonstrated unconstitutional behavior by a succession of presidents, the violation of their oath and the violation of the oath of every one of their subordinates."&lt;ref name=demnow&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=07/07/02/1331255 |title=How the ''Pentagon Papers'' Came to be Published by the Beacon Press: A Remarkable Story Told by Whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg, Dem Presidential Candidate Mike Gravel and Unitarian Leader Robert West |publisher=[[Democracy Now!]] |date= |accessdate=2013-10-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703224833/http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=07%2F07%2F02%2F1331255 |archivedate=2007-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He added that he leaked the Papers to end what he perceived to be "a wrongful war."&lt;ref name=demnow /&gt;

=== The Nixon administration's restraint of the media ===

President Nixon at first planned to do nothing about publication of the study since it embarrassed the Johnson and Kennedy administrations rather than his. But Henry Kissinger convinced the president that not opposing the publication set a negative precedent for future secrets.&lt;ref name="correll200702"/&gt; The administration argued Ellsberg and Russo were guilty of a [[felony]] under the [[Espionage Act of 1917]], because they had no authority to publish classified documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pentagon Papers Case|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB48/nixon.html|accessdate=2005-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; After failing to persuade ''The New York Times'' to voluntarily cease publication on June 14,&lt;ref name="correll200702"/&gt; [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[John N. Mitchell]] and Nixon obtained a federal court injunction forcing ''The New York Times'' to cease publication after three articles.&lt;ref name="correll200702"/&gt; ''The New York Times'' publisher [[Arthur Ochs Sulzberger]] said:

{{quote|Newspapers, as our editorial said this morning, we're really a part of history that should have been made available, considerably longer ago. I just didn't feel there was any breach of national security, in the sense that we were giving secrets to the enemy.&lt;ref name="upi.com"/&gt;}}

The newspaper appealed the injunction, and the case ''[[New York Times Co. v. United States]]'' (403 U.S. 713) quickly rose through the U.S. legal system to the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]].&lt;ref name="case"&gt;{{cite web|title=New York Times Co. v. United States, 403 U.S. 713 (1971)|url=http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/cases/403us713.htm|accessdate=2005-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 18, 1971, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' began publishing its own series of articles based upon the ''Pentagon Papers'';&lt;ref name="correll200702"/&gt; Ellsberg had given portions to ''The Washington Post'' reporter [[Ben Bagdikian]]. Bagdikian brought the information to editor [[Ben Bradlee]]. That day, Assistant U.S. Attorney General [[William Rehnquist]] asked ''The Washington Post'' to cease publication. After the paper refused, Rehnquist sought an injunction in U.S. district court. Judge [[Murray Gurfein]] declined to issue such an injunction, writing that "[t]he security of the Nation is not at the ramparts alone. Security also lies in the value of our free institutions. A cantankerous press, an obstinate press, a ubiquitous press must be suffered by those in authority to preserve the even greater values of freedom of expression and the right of the people to know."&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. N.Y. Times Co.]]'', 328 F. Supp. 324, 331 (S.D.N.Y. 1971).&lt;/ref&gt; The government appealed that decision, and on June 26 the Supreme Court agreed to hear it jointly with ''The New York Times'' case.&lt;ref name="case"/&gt; Fifteen other newspapers received copies of the study and began publishing it.&lt;ref name="correll200702"/&gt;

=== The Supreme Court allows further publication ===
{{Main|New York Times Co. v. United States}}
On June 30, 1971, the Supreme Court decided, 6–3, that the government failed to meet the heavy [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] required for [[prior restraint]] injunction. The nine justices wrote nine opinions disagreeing on significant, substantive matters.

{{quote|Only a free and unrestrained press can effectively expose deception in government. And paramount among the responsibilities of a free press is the duty to prevent any part of the government from deceiving the people and sending them off to distant lands to die of foreign fevers and foreign shot and shell.|Justice Black&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NEW YORK TIMES CO. v. UNITED STATES, 403 U.S. 713 (1971)|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=403&amp;invol=713}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thomas Tedford and Dale Herbeck summarized the reaction of editors and journalists at the time:

{{quote|As the press rooms of the ''Times'' and the ''Post'' began to hum to the lifting of the censorship order, the journalists of America pondered with grave concern the fact that for fifteen days the 'free press' of the nation had been prevented from publishing an important document and for their troubles had been given an inconclusive and uninspiring 'burden-of-proof' decision by a sharply divided Supreme Court. There was relief, but no great rejoicing, in the editorial offices of America's publishers and broadcasters.|Tedford and Herbeck, pp. 225–226.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tedford &amp; Herbeck, Freedom of Speech in the United States, 5 ed.|url=http://www.stratapub.com/TedfordHerbeck/tedford_&amp;_herbeck_freedom_of_speech_in_the_united_states.htm|accessdate=2005-12-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051202043033/http://www.stratapub.com/TedfordHerbeck/tedford_%26_herbeck_freedom_of_speech_in_the_united_states.htm|archive-date=2005-12-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Legal charges against Ellsberg ===

Ellsberg surrendered to authorities in Boston, and admitted that he had given the papers to the press: "I felt that as an American citizen, as a responsible citizen, I could no longer cooperate in concealing this information from the American public. I did this clearly at my own jeopardy and I am prepared to answer to all the consequences of this decision".&lt;ref name="upi.com"/&gt; He was indicted by a grand jury in Los Angeles on charges of stealing and holding secret documents.&lt;ref name="upi.com"&gt;[https://www.upi.com/Archives/Audio/Events-of-1971/The-Pentagon-Papers/ The Pentagon Papers] 1971 Year in Review, UPI&lt;/ref&gt; Federal District Judge [[William Matthew Byrne, Jr.]] declared a [[mistrial (law)|mistrial]] and dismissed all charges against Ellsberg and Russo on May 11, 1973, after it was revealed that: agents acting on the orders of the Nixon administration illegally broke into the office of Ellsberg's psychiatrist and attempted to steal files; representatives of the Nixon administration approached the Ellsberg trial judge with an offer of the job of FBI directorship; several irregularities appeared in the government's case including its claim that it had lost records of illegal wiretapping against Ellsberg conducted by the [[White House Plumbers]] in the contemporaneous [[Watergate scandal]]. Byrne ruled: "The totality of the circumstances of this case which I have only briefly sketched offend a sense of justice. The bizarre events have incurably infected the prosecution of this case." Ellsberg and Russo were freed due to the mistrial; they were not acquitted of violating the Espionage Act.&lt;ref name="correll200702"/&gt;

In March 1972, political scientist [[Samuel L. Popkin]], then assistant professor of Government at [[Harvard University]], was jailed for a week for his refusal to answer questions before a grand jury investigating the Pentagon Papers case, during a hearing before the [[Boston]] [[Federal District Court]]. The Faculty Council later passed a resolution condemning the government's interrogation of scholars on the grounds that "an unlimited right of grand juries to ask any question and to expose a witness to citations for contempt could easily threaten scholarly research".&lt;ref name=Meislin&gt;Meislin, Richard J. [https://archive.is/20130204085944/http://theharvardcrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=495202 Popkin Faces Jail Sentence In Contempt of Court Case], ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'', March 22, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gelb estimated that ''The New York Times'' only published about five percent of the study's 7,000 pages. The Beacon Press edition was also incomplete. Halperin, who had originally classified the study as secret, obtained most of the unpublished portions under the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] and the [[University of Texas]] published them in 1983. The [[National Security Archive]] published the remaining portions in 2002. The study itself remained formally classified until 2011.&lt;ref name="correll200702"/&gt;

== Impact ==
The ''Pentagon Papers'' revealed that the United States had expanded its war with the bombing of Cambodia and Laos, coastal raids on North Vietnam, and Marine Corps attacks, none of which had been reported by the American media.&lt;ref name="'70s 43"&gt;{{cite book|title=How We Got Here: The '70s|last=Frum|first=David|authorlink=David Frum|year=2000|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York, New York|isbn=0-465-04195-7|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most damaging revelations in the papers revealed that four administrations (Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson), had misled the public regarding their intentions. For example, the Eisenhower administration actively worked against the [[1954 Geneva Conference|Geneva Accords]]. The John F. Kennedy administration knew of plans to overthrow South Vietnamese leader Ngo Dinh Diem before his death in a [[1963 South Vietnamese coup|November 1963 coup]]. President Johnson had decided to expand the war while promising "we seek no wider war" during his 1964 presidential campaign,&lt;ref name="correll200702" /&gt; including plans to bomb North Vietnam well before the [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964 Election]]. President Johnson had been outspoken against doing so during the election and claimed that his opponent [[Barry Goldwater]] was the one that wanted to bomb North Vietnam.&lt;ref name="upi.com"/&gt;

In another example, a memo from the Defense Department under the Johnson Administration listed the reasons for American persistence:
* 70% – To avoid a humiliating U.S. defeat (to our reputation as a guarantor).
* 20% – To keep [South Vietnam] (and the adjacent) territory from Chinese hands.
* 10% – To permit the people [of South Vietnam] to enjoy a better, freer way of life.
* ALSO – To emerge from the crisis without unacceptable taint from methods used.
* NOT – To help a friend, although it would be hard to stay in if asked out.&lt;ref name="correll200702" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perlstein|first=Rick|authorlink=Rick Perlstein|title=[[Nixonland: The Rise of a President and the Fracturing of America]]|year=2008|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-7432-4302-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another controversy was that President Johnson sent combat troops to Vietnam by July 17, 1965, before pretending to consult his advisors on July 21–27, per the cable stating that "[[United States Deputy Secretary of Defense|Deputy Secretary of Defense]] [[Cyrus Vance]] informs McNamara that President had approved 34 Battalion Plan and will try to push through [[Reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States|reserve]] call-up."&lt;ref name="Mtholyoke2"&gt;[http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/pentagon4/pent6.htm Chronology]. "U.S. Ground Strategy and Force Deployments, 1965-1968," (1971). Pp. 277-604 in ''The Pentagon Papers, Gravel Edition'' Vol. 4. Boston: Beacon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, when that cable was declassified, it revealed "there was a continuing uncertainty as to [Johnson's] final decision, which would have to await Secretary McNamara's recommendation and the views of Congressional leaders, particularly the views of [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Richard Russell, Jr.|[Richard] Russell]]."&lt;ref&gt;John Burke and Fred Greenstein, ''How Presidents Test Reality: Decisions on Vietnam, 1954 and 1965''. (1989) p. 215 n. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nixon's [[Solicitor General of the United States|Solicitor General]] [[Erwin N. Griswold]] later called the ''Pentagon Papers'' an example of "massive overclassification" with "no trace of a threat to the national security." The ''Pentagon Papers''' publication had little or no effect on the ongoing war because they dealt with documents written years before publication.&lt;ref name="correll200702" /&gt;

After the release of the ''Pentagon Papers'', [[Barry Goldwater|Goldwater]] said:

{{quote|During the campaign, President Johnson kept reiterating that he would never send American boys to fight in Vietnam. As I say, he knew at the time that American boys were going to be sent. In fact, I knew about ten days before the Republican Convention. You see I was being called a trigger-happy, warmonger, bomb happy, and all the time Johnson was saying, he would never send American boys, I knew damn well he would.&lt;ref name="upi.com"/&gt;}}

Senator [[Birch Bayh]], who thought the publishing of the ''Pentagon Papers'' was justified, said:

{{quote|The existence of these documents, and the fact that they said one thing and the people were led to believe something else, is a reason we have a credibility gap today, the reason people don't believe the government. This is the same thing that's been going on over the last two-and-a-half years of this administration. There is a difference between what the President says and what the government actually does, and I have confidence that they are going to make the right decision, if they have all the facts.&lt;ref name="upi.com" /&gt;}}

==Nygård Cay==

In 1987, Nygård built a {{convert|150000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} compound at [[Lyford Cay]] in the Bahamas.  It was partly destroyed by a fire on November 10, 2009.&lt;ref name="nygard_cay_fire"&gt;[http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/breakingnews/Fire-destroys-Nygards-Bahamas-compound-69911722.html "Fire destroys Nygard's Bahamas compound"], [[Winnipeg Free Press]], November 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The Cay is inspired by the [[Mayan civilization]]’s architecture. One of the major buildings is a 32,000 ft&lt;sup&gt;2 &lt;/sup&gt;grand-hall with a 100,000&amp;nbsp;lb glass ceiling.&lt;ref name="DTProfile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unusualvillarentals.com/caribbean/bahamas/nygard/|title=Nygård Cay|publisher=unusualvillarentals.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626100416/http://www.unusualvillarentals.com/caribbean/bahamas/nygard/|archive-date=2010-06-26|dead-url=yes|accessdate=28 June 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 14, 2010 Peter Nygard announced he was planning a $50 million renovation of Nygård Cay, which would take two years to complete and repair the damage and employ 200 construction workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenassauguardian.com/bixex/325682364938194.php|title=Nygard pledges 50 million comeback|publisher=[[List of newspapers in the Bahamas|The Nassau Guardian]]|accessdate=June 28, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627081222/http://www.thenassauguardian.com/bixex/325682364938194.php|archive-date=2010-06-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribune242.com/searchresults/16082010_nkn-nygard-no-license_news_pg1|title=Nygard Cay is not licensed as commercial property|publisher=The Nassau Tribune|date=August 16, 2010|accessdate=August 31, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822030630/http://www.tribune242.com/searchresults/16082010_nkn-nygard-no-license_news_pg1|archive-date=2010-08-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; But a letter from the Bahamian prime minister's office rejected his construction application, citing the improper expansion of his property through intentional accretion of land over the seabed.

On September 28, 2018 Nygård Cay was seized by the Supreme Court of the Bahamas as part of a legal battle surrounding Nygard’s efforts to dredge the sea floor around the estate [https://theworldnews.net/ca-news/peter-nygard-locked-out-of-his-luxury-home-in-bizarre-bahamas-feud]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4566">'''Philip "Phil" Flynn''' (born 1940 in [[Dundalk]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]) is an Irish businessman. He was previously a vice-president of [[Sinn Féin]], a trade unionist, an industrial relations consultant, a government advisor and a financier. He was the eldest of five children of a nationalist mother and [[Fine Gael]] father.

He joined Sinn Féin at the age of 14 and lent support to some of those involved in the [[Border Campaign (IRA)|IRA Border campaign]] of the 1950s. He was taken in for police questioning on a number of occasions owing to his political activities. In 1974, he was tried with IRA membership, but acquitted, by the [[Special Criminal Court]]. During the trial, the state alleged that he was [[IRA Director of Finance]]. In [[Liverpool]], he was arrested and held for three days under the [[Prevention of Terrorism Acts|Prevention of Terrorism Act]]. In 1975, he came to public prominence when he acted as a mediator in the [[Tiede Herrema]] kidnap siege.

In 1984, he was elected general secretary of the [[Local Government and Public Services Union]]. His election caused problems for the Fine Gael-Labour administration as Flynn was also vice-president of Sinn Féin and as such, government officials and ministers refused to talk to him. Shortly after, he was elected to the executive of the [[Irish Congress of Trade Unions]] (ICTU). In the same year, he stepped down as Sinn Féin vice-president, telling the party's [[Ard fheis]] that his experience and support would always be available to the movement. 

In 1987, he was reported to have resigned from Sinn Féin. From 1993 to 1995, he was president of ICTU, representing the [[Irish Municipal Public and Civil Trade Union]]. In 1996, he was appointed chairman of the Industrial Credit Corporation (ICC) by [[Ruairi Quinn]]. ICC was subsequently acquired by the [[Bank of Scotland]] in 2001.

In February 2005, Flynn's office was raided by officers of the [[Criminal Assets Bureau]] (CAB) as part of an investigation into alleged IRA [[money-laundering]]. Flynn was a non-executive directors Chesterton Finance Company Ltd, a company at the centre of the CAB investigation. As a result, he resigned as chairman of the Irish Government committee on decentralisation, as non-executive chairman of [[Bank of Scotland (Ireland)]] and as director of the [[VHI]]. During the search of his officers, Flynn was found to be the illegal possession of a [[pen gun]] and mini [[tear gas]] canisters. At related court hearing In December 2005, he admitted to possession and agreed to pay €5,000 to a charity.

Ted Cunningham, the [[Cork (city)|Cork]] based financial adviser convicted of [[money laundering|laundering]] £3 million of the sum stolen by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] in the 2004 [[Northern Bank robbery]] stated "Phil Flynn is the boss behind everything" in a garda interview about the robbery introduced in evidence in Cunningham's trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Flynn ‘elephant in room’ during trial | author = Liam Heylin | url = http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/idqlsneygb/ | publisher = [[Irish Examiner]] | date = 28 March 2009 | accessdate = 2009-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Off tape admissions told the real story | author = Liam Heylin | url = http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/idqlsneymh/ | publisher = [[Irish Examiner]] | date = 28 March 2009 | accessdate = 2009-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After returning from service in [[World War II]], Mr. Kemper enrolled in the [[University of Missouri]] and became a member of the [[Zeta Phi]] chapter of [[Beta Theta Pi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.library.umsystem.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=savitar;cc=savitar;sid=bfbda456ae637097ccd859f5c74918b8;q1=Crosby%20Kemper;rgn=full%20text;idno=sav1947;view=image;seq=179 Pageviewer: Beta Theta Pi]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rolf Dobelli''' (born July 15, 1966 in [[Luzern]], Switzerland&lt;ref&gt;http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/695505.Rolf_Dobelli&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Swiss people|Swiss]] author and businessman.
He began his writing career as a novelist in 2002, but he is best known internationally for his bestselling non-fiction ''[[The Art of Thinking Clearly]]'' (2011, English 2013), for which [[The Times]] has called him "the self-help guru the Germans love".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/life/article3791190.ece The Times, June 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in 1966 in [[Lucerne]], Switzerland, he obtained an [[MBA]] in 1991 from the [[University of St. Gallen]] and a  [[PhD]] in [[economic philosophy]] in 1995. In 1999, he co-founded [[getAbstract]], a publisher of book summaries and article abstracts.

In 2003, [[Diogenes Verlag]] (Switzerland) published his first [[novel]], ''Fünfunddreissig'' ("Thirty-five"), followed by  ''Und was machen Sie beruflich?'' ("And What Do You Do for a Living?") in 2004, ''Himmelreich'' (The Heavens) in 2006, ''Wer bin ich?'' ("Who am I?") and ''Turbulenzen'' ("Turbulence") in 2007 and ''Massimo Marini'' in 2010. 
The major themes in Dobelli's novels are the meaning of success and the role of [[randomness]] in business and in life.

Dobelli is the author of ''[[The Art of Thinking Clearly]]'' (''Die Kunst des klaren Denkens''), originally published by [[Carl Hanser Verlag]] in 2011, which was an instant success, entering Germany's [[Der Spiegel]] Bestseller list as number 1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buchreport.de/bestseller/hardcover/bestseller/4.htm Der Spiegel Bestseller List, 12 Jan 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731040023/http://www.buchreport.de/bestseller/hardcover/bestseller/4.htm |date=2008-07-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
It was the bestselling non-fiction book in Germany and Switzerland in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[[Der Spiegel]] print edition 1/2013 p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; It was translated into English in 2013 and hit the top ten bestseller lists in the U.K,&lt;ref&gt;[[The Times]] bestseller list hardback non-fiction, 21 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Sunday Times bestseller list 7 July 2013 (rank number 4)&lt;/ref&gt; South Korea, India,&lt;ref&gt;[Crossword book retailer's bestseller list June 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; Ireland,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.writing.ie/news/irish-bestsellers-this-week/ Writing.IE Bestseller List, 14 June 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; Hong Kong and Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Straits Times]] bestseller list non-fiction, 28 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
''The Art of Thinking Clearly'' was attacked by [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb]] and [[Christopher Chabris]] for [[plagiarism]].&lt;ref&gt;Guido Kalberer, [www.tagesanzeiger.ch/kultur/buecher/Nassim-Taleb-attackiert-Rolf-Dobelli/story/11573752  Nassim Taleb attackiert Rolf Dobelli], [[Tages-Anzeiger]], 12 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/dobelli.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202004155/http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/dobelli.htm |archivedate=2016-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christopher Chabris]] has published an example in Dobelli's book that is referenced but does not have quotation marks, and four paragraphs in the notes/references section (unprinted in most editions) without the formally required proper credit. Dobelli acknowledged those errors and they will be fixed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.chabris.com/2013/09/similarities-between-rolf-dobellis-book.html] [http://www.dobelli.com/book-corrections]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dobelli advises  to "avoid news consumption" &lt;ref&gt;[http://dobelli.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Avoid_News_Part1_TEXT.pdf Avoid News - Towards a healthy news diet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117104220/http://dobelli.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Avoid_News_Part1_TEXT.pdf |date=2013-01-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an idea he learnt from Nassim Taleb and attributed to him, but in one later instance failed to properly credit to Taleb.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Guardian|Guardian]] [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/apr/12/news-is-bad-rolf-dobelli News is bad for you – and giving up reading it will make you happier] print and online edition of 13 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; He cites "fifteen reasons to avoid news"  in a 2013 blog post.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p018f3h3 "All in the Mind" on BBC Radio 30 April 2013, starting at 15:00 min].

'''Robert Sargent Shriver Jr.'''&lt;ref name="NYT-obit"/&gt; ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɑr|dʒ|ən|t|_|ˈ|ʃ|r|aɪ|v|ər}}; November 9, 1915 – January 18, 2011) was an American diplomat, politician and activist. As the husband of [[Eunice Kennedy Shriver]], he was part of the [[Kennedy family]]. Shriver was the driving force behind the creation of the [[Peace Corps]], and founded the [[Job Corps]], [[Head Start Program|Head Start]], and other programs as the "architect" of the 1960s "[[War on Poverty]]."&lt;ref name="NYT-obit"/&gt; He was the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]'s nominee for Vice President in the [[United States presidential election, 1972|1972 presidential election]].

Born in [[Westminster, Maryland]], Shriver pursued a legal career after graduating from [[Yale Law School]]. An opponent of U.S. entry into [[World War II]], he helped establish the [[America First Committee]] but volunteered for the [[United States Navy]] before the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. During the war, he served in the South Pacific, participating in the [[naval Battle of Guadalcanal]]. After being discharged from the navy, he worked as an assistant editor for ''[[Newsweek]]'' and met Eunice Kennedy, marrying her in 1953.

He worked on the 1960 presidential campaign of his brother-in-law, [[John F. Kennedy]], and helped establish the Peace Corps after Kennedy's victory. After Kennedy's assassination, Shriver served in the administration of [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and helped establish several anti-poverty programs as director of the [[Office of Economic Opportunity]] from October 16, 1964 to March 22, 1968.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=26617 Remarks at the Swearing In of Sargent Shriver as Director, Office of Economic Opportunity.] The American Presidency Project. Retrieved 7 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; He also served as the [[United States Ambassador to France]] from 1968 to 1970. In 1972, Democratic vice presidential nominee [[Thomas Eagleton]] resigned from the ticket, and Shriver was chosen as his replacement. The Democratic ticket of [[George McGovern]] and Shriver lost in a [[United States presidential election, 1972|landslide election defeat]] to Republican President [[Richard Nixon]] and Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]]. Shriver briefly sought the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1976|1976 Democratic presidential nomination]] but dropped out of the race after the first set of primaries.

After leaving office, he resumed the practice of law, becoming a partner with [[Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver &amp; Jacobson]]. He also served as president of the [[Special Olympics]] and was briefly a part-owner of the [[Baltimore Orioles]]. He was diagnosed with [[Alzheimer's disease]] in 2003 and died in [[Bethesda, Maryland]] in 2011.

==Early life and career==
Shriver was born in [[Westminster, Maryland]], the younger son of Robert Sargent Shriver Sr. and his wife Hilda, who had also been born with the surname "Shriver" (they were second cousins).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shorter|first1=Edward|title=The Kennedy Family and the Story of Mental Retardation|date=2000|publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=1-566-39782-0|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarge's elder brother was Thomas Herbert Shriver. Of partial [[German American|German ancestry]], Shriver was a descendant of David Shriver, who signed the [[List of delegates to the Maryland Constitutional Convention (1776)|Maryland Constitution and Bill of Rights at Maryland's Constitutional Convention of 1776]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,906202-1,00.html |title=The New Nominee No Longer Half a Kennedy |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=August 14, 1972 |accessdate=September 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent his high school years at [[Canterbury School (Connecticut)|Canterbury School]] in [[New Milford, Connecticut]], which he attended on a full scholarship. He was on Canterbury's baseball, basketball, and football teams, became the editor of the school's newspaper, and participated in choral and debating clubs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newstimes.com/local/article/R-Sargent-Shriver-built-roots-at-New-Milford-s-1025181.php&lt;/ref&gt; After he graduated in 1934, Shriver spent the summer in Germany as part of The [[Experiment in International Living]], returning in the fall of 1934 to enter [[Yale University]].

An early opponent of American involvement in [[World War II]], Shriver was a founding member of the [[America First Committee]], an organization started in 1940 by a group of [[Yale Law School]] students, also including future President [[Gerald Ford]] and future Supreme Court Justice [[Potter Stewart]], which tried to keep the US out of the European war.&lt;ref name="KauffmanSarles2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kauffman|first1=Bill|last2=Sarles|first2=Ruth|authorlink2=Ruth Sarles|title=A story of America First: the men and women who opposed U.S. intervention in World War II|year=2003|publisher=Praeger|location=New York|isbn=0-275-97512-6|page=xvii}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, Shriver volunteered for the [[US Navy]] before the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] and said he had a duty to serve his country even if he disagreed with its policies. He spent five years on active duty, mostly in the [[South Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]], serving aboard the {{USS|South Dakota|BB-57}}, reaching the rank of [[lieutenant (naval)|lieutenant]] (O-3). He was awarded a [[Purple Heart]] for wounds he received during the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal|bombardment]] of [[Guadalcanal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schoifet |first=Mark |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-18/sargent-shriver-kennedy-kin-and-founder-of-u-s-peace-corps-dies-at-95.html |title=Sargent Shriver, Kennedy In-Law, Founder of U.S. Peace Corps, Dies at 95 |publisher=Bloomberg |date= January 19, 2011|accessdate=February 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shriver's relationship with the Kennedys began when he was working as an assistant editor at ''[[Newsweek]]'' after his discharge from the Navy. He met Eunice Kennedy at a party in New York, and shortly afterwards, family patriarch [[Joseph P. Kennedy Sr.]] asked him to look at diary entries written by his eldest son, [[Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.]], who had died in a plane crash while he was on a military mission during World War II. Shriver was later hired to manage the [[Merchandise Mart]], part of Kennedy's business empire, in Chicago, Illinois.&lt;ref name="WashPost-obit"&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/18/AR2011011805116.html| title = Sargent Shriver dies at 95; founded Peace Corps| author = Patricia Sullivan|author2=Emma Brown | date = January 18, 2011| work = [[The Washington Post]]| accessdate =January 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a seven-year courtship, Shriver married [[Eunice Kennedy Shriver|Eunice Kennedy]] on May 23, 1953, at [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York|St. Patrick's Cathedral]] in New York City. She was the third daughter of Joseph Kennedy Sr. and [[Rose Kennedy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jfklibrary.org/Historical+Resources/Archives/Archives+and+Manuscripts/Shriver.Sargent/fa_shriver_long.htm |title=R(obert) Sargent Shriver: Papers (#214) - John F.

They had five children: [[Bobby Shriver|Robert Sargent "Bobby" Shriver III]] (born April 28, 1954), [[Maria Shriver|Maria Owings Shriver]] (born November 6, 1955), [[Timothy Shriver|Timothy Perry Shriver]] (born August 29, 1959), [[Mark Shriver|Mark Kennedy Shriver]] (born February 17, 1964), and [[Anthony Shriver|Anthony Paul Kennedy Shriver]] (born July 20, 1965).

A devout Catholic, Shriver attended daily [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] and always carried a [[rosary]] of well-worn wooden beads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://peacecorpsonline.org/messages/messages/2629/1009097.html |publisher=National Catholic Reporter |title=Sargent Shriver and the politics of life |date=August 30, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was critical of abortion and was a signatory to "A New Compact of Care: Caring about Women, Caring for the Unborn", which appeared in the ''[[New York Times]]'' in July 1992 and stated that "To establish justice and to promote the general welfare, America does not need the abortion license. What America needs are policies that responsibly protect and advance the interest of mothers and their children, both before and after birth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic.org/politics/story.php?id=40015 |publisher=Catholic Online |title=Pro-Life Liberal Sargent Shriver Dies |date=January 19, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124045218/http://www.catholic.org/politics/story.php?id=40015 |archivedate=January 24, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==

===1950s===
He was appointed to and served as president of the Chicago Board of Education.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-sargent-shriver-20110119,0,3549392.story|title=R.

===1960s===
[[File:Sargent Shriver-JFK.jpg|thumb|left|Shriver and JFK at the White House in August 1961.]]
When brother-in-law [[John F. Kennedy]] ran for president, Shriver worked as a political and organization coordinator in the Wisconsin and West Virginia primaries. During Kennedy's presidential term, Shriver founded and served as the first director of the [[Peace Corps]] from March 22, 1961 to February 28, 1966.&lt;ref name="NYT-obit" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peacecorps.gov/index.cfm?shell=learn.whatispc.history.pastdir&amp;btn=1 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031226082426/http://www.peacecorps.gov/index.cfm?shell=learn.whatispc.history.pastdir&amp;btn=1 |archivedate=December 26, 2003 |title=About the Peace Corps : Past Directors |accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|Kennedy's assassination]], Shriver continued to serve as Director of the Peace Corps and served as Special Assistant to President [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Lyndon Johnson]]. Under Johnson, he created the [[Office of Economic Opportunity]] with William B. Mullins and served as its first Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE2D81630F935A25756C0A966958260 | work=The New York Times | title=W. B.

The [[Job Corps]] movement was more consistent with his goals. Thus, soon after his appointment, Shriver "moved quickly to reconsider the proposed antipoverty initiative."&lt;ref&gt;Vinovskis, M. A. (2008) Birth of Head Start: Preschool education policies in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press. 
p. 42-43&lt;/ref&gt;

Shriver founded numerous social programs and organizations, including [[Head Start Program|Head Start]],&lt;ref name="HShistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paheadstart.org/UserFiles/File/General_History.pdf|title=Head Start History: 1965-Present|publisher=Pennsylvania Head Start Association|accessdate=January 21, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515203448/http://www.paheadstart.org/UserFiles/File/General_History.pdf|archivedate=May 15, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Volunteers in Service to America|VISTA]], [[Job Corps]], Community Action, [[Upward Bound]], Foster Grandparents, Legal Services, the National Clearinghouse for Legal Services (now the Shriver Center), Indian and Migrant Opportunities and Neighborhood Health Services, in addition to directing the Peace Corps. He was active in [[Special Olympics]], founded by his wife Eunice.

Shriver was awarded the [[Pacem in Terris Award|Pacem in Terris Peace and Freedom Award]] in 1967. It was named after a 1963 [[encyclical]] letter by [[Pope John XXIII]] that calls upon all people of good will to secure peace among all nations. ''[[Pacem in terris]]'' is [[Latin]] for 'Peace on Earth'.

Shriver served as [[U.S. Ambassador to France]] from 1968 to 1970, becoming a quasi-celebrity among the French for bringing what ''[[Time magazine|Time]]'' magazine called "a rare and welcome panache" to the normally sedate world of international diplomacy.&lt;ref name="time68"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,839591,00.html |title=Diplomacy: The Liveliest Ambassador|date=November 1, 1968|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]| accessdate=January 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s and Vice Presidential/Presidential candidacies===
{{main|United States presidential election, 1972}}

During the [[1972 Democratic National Convention]] in [[Miami Beach]], Florida, [[George McGovern]] considered Shriver as a vice presidential candidate, but his campaign was unable to reach Shriver, who was at the time visiting [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Shriver then replaced Eagleton on the ticket. The McGovern-Shriver ticket lost to Republican incumbents [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Spiro Agnew]].

Shriver unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination in [[United States presidential election, 1976|1976]]. In the months before [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1976|the primaries]] began, political observers thought that Shriver would draw strength from legions of former colleagues from the Peace Corps and the War on Poverty programs, and he was even seen as an inheritor of the Kennedy legacy, but neither theory proved true.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Koster |first=R.

==Life after politics==
He was associated with the [[Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver &amp; Jacobson]] law firm in Washington, D.C., where he specialized in international law and foreign affairs, beginning in 1971.&lt;ref name=ffhsj/&gt; He retired as partner in 1986 and was then named [[of counsel]] to the firm.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}

In 1981, Shriver was appointed to the [[Rockefeller University Council]], an organization devoted exclusively to research and graduate education in the biomedical and related sciences.

In 1984, he was elected President of [[Special Olympics]] by the Board of Directors; as President, he directed the operation and international development of sports programs around the world. Six years later, in 1990, he was appointed Chairman of the Board of Special Olympics.

He was an investor in the [[Baltimore Orioles]] along with his eldest son [[Bobby Shriver]], [[Eli Jacobs]], and [[Larry Lucchino]] from 1989&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, Mark S. "Orioles are sold: $70 million; Buyers say team will stay," ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'', December 7, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; to 1993.

==Illness and death==
Shriver was diagnosed with [[Alzheimer's disease]] in 2003. In 2004, his daughter, [[Maria Shriver|Maria]], published a children's book, ''What's Happening to Grandpa?'', to help explain Alzheimer's to children.

Following his death, Daniel Larison wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Shriver was an admirable, principled, and conscientious man who respected the dignity and sanctity of human life, and he also happened to be a contemporary and in-law of Kennedy. Not only did Shriver represent a "link" with JFK, but he represented a particular culture of white ethnic Catholic Democratic politics that has been gradually disappearing for the last fifty years. A pro-life Catholic, Shriver had been a founding member of the America First Committee, and more famously he was also on the 1972 antiwar ticket with George McGovern. In short, he represented much of what was good in the Democratic Party of his time.&lt;ref&gt;Larison, Daniel [http://www.amconmag.com/larison/2011/01/24/shriver-and-lieberman/ Shriver and Lieberman], ''[[The American Conservative]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Secret of My Success''''' (sometimes stylized as ''The Secret of My Succe$s'') is a 1987 American [[comedy film]] produced and directed by [[Herbert Ross]], and starring [[Michael J. Fox]] and [[Helen Slater]]. The screenplay was written by [[AJ Carothers|A.J. Carothers]], [[Jim Cash]] and [[Jack Epps, Jr.]] from a story written by Carothers.

==Plot==
Brantley Foster ([[Michael J. Fox]]) is a recent graduate of [[Kansas State University]] who moves to New York City where he has landed an [[entry level]] job as a financier. Upon arriving, he discovers that the company for which he is supposed to work has been taken over by a rival corporation. As a result, Brantley is laid off before he even starts working.

After several unsuccessful attempts to get another job, mostly because he is either overqualified or underqualified and has little experience, Brantley ends up working in the mailroom of the Pemrose Corporation, which is directed by his uncle, Howard Prescott ([[Richard Jordan]]), the CEO. Pemrose was founded by Howard's father-in-law; Howard received presidency of the company by marrying his boss's daughter, Vera Pemrose ([[Margaret Whitton]]).

Upon inspecting company reports, Brantley realizes that Howard and most of his fellow "suits" (executives) are making ineffective or detrimental decisions. After Brantley notices an empty office in the building due to one of Howard's frequent firings, he uses his access to the mailroom and his understanding of company processes to create the identity of Carlton Whitfield, a new executive. Brantley then assumes this role.

While handling two jobs (switching between casual wear and business suits in the elevator), Brantley also falls head-over-heels for Christy Wills ([[Helen Slater]]), a fellow financial wizard who recently graduated from [[Harvard]]. Brantley meets Vera after driving her home in a company limo (at his employer's request). Vera persuades Brantley to stay for a swim and seduces him by stripping off his swimsuit and having an underwater kiss before she rips off her swimsuit and ultimately swims naked with him. Upon seeing Howard arriving, Brantley and Vera realize they are related (albeit not by blood). Vera only seduced Brantley to get back at her husband for having an affair with a woman in his office. Brantley then gets changed as fast as he can and leaves the mansion without being seen by Howard.

Howard, without Brantley's knowledge, is having an affair with Christy. When Howard asks her to spy on Carlton Whitfield, Christy falls head-over-heels for "Whitfield", not knowing he is actually Brantley. The Pemrose Corporation is preparing to merge with the infamous Davenport Corporation. If Davenport Corporation merges with Pemrose, everyone gets fired. Howard, unaware that Whitfield and Brantley are one and the same person, suspects "Whitfield" is a spy for [[corporate raid]]er Donald Davenport ([[Fred Gwynne]]). Brantley’s double identity is discovered when he, Christy, Vera and Howard end up in the same bedroom after a party at Howard’s home that all 4 are attending. Brantley and Christy end their budding relationship and Brantley gets sacked from his job he did as Whitfield, as does Christy for refusing to continue the affair with Howard.

While both Christy and Brantley are moving out of their offices, they end up in the same elevator and make up, conceiving a revenge plan with Vera. In the end, they raise enough cash, bonds, and stocks to wrest ownership of the Pemrose Corporation from Howard, and to proceed with a hostile takeover bid of Davenport's Corporation. Vera, already contemptuous of Howard for his counter-productive business practices, which were driving her father's empire into the ground, tells the board about his affair as well. She promptly replaces him with Brantley, with Jean, Christy and Melrose at his side. While security guards escort Howard and his aide, Art Thomas ([[Gerry Bamman]]), from the Pemrose Building, Brantley and Christy start planning their future together, personal as well as professional.

The soundtrack was released on LP and cassette tape on April 10, 1987.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000002O59/ ''The Secret of My Success: Music from the Motion Picture Soundtrack'' at Amazon.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Secret of My Success, credits at Allmusic"&gt;{{ cite web | url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=mw0000191675|tab=credits|pure_url=yes}} | title=''The Secret of My Success: Music From The Motion Picture Soundtrack'' credits | date=October 17, 1990 | accessdate=July 1, 2013 | origyear=1987 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven of the 10 tracks were produced, and either written or co-written, by [[David Foster]], who also scored the film and has three tracks of his own on the album.

Not all of the songs featured in the film are included on the soundtrack, or, at least not in the same version. The film version of the song "The Secret of My Success" is slightly different, and also features a mini-instrumental version. The film version of "I Burn for You" does not feature vocals, whereas the soundtrack version does. The "[[Restless Heart]]" track from the film has a different title ("Something I Gotta Do"), and different lyrics than the soundtrack version.

Popular songs "[[Walking on Sunshine (Katrina and the Waves song)|Walking on Sunshine]]" by [[Katrina &amp; The Waves]] and "[[Oh Yeah (Yello song)|Oh Yeah]]" by [[Yello]] are heard in the film but do not appear on the soundtrack.

The soundtrack peaked at #131 on the ''Billboard'' 200.&lt;ref name="The Secret of My Success, charts at Allmusic"&gt;{{Allmusic|class=album|id=mw0000191675|tab=awards|label=''The Secret of My Success: Music From The Motion Picture Soundtrack'' Billboard 200|accessdate=July 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theme from the picture "[[The Secret of My Success (song)|The Secret of My Success]]", performed by [[Night Ranger]], was one of the songs that competed for the [[Golden Globe Award]] for Best Original Song in 1988. The winner in question was "[[(I've Had) The Time of My Life]]", the central theme from ''[[Dirty Dancing]]'', performed by [[Bill Medley]] and [[Jennifer Warnes]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Reception==
===Critical response===
The film received a mixed response from critics.
[[Roger Ebert]] in the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' wrote, "''The Secret of My Success'' seems trapped in some kind of time warp, as if the screenplay had been in a drawer since the 1950s and nobody bothered to update it." He concluded "Fox provides a fairly desperate center for the film. It could not have been much fun for him to follow the movie's arbitrary shifts of mood, from sitcom to slapstick, from sex farce to boardroom brawls."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=The Secret of My Success, |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19870410/REVIEWS/704100301|work=Chicago Sun Times |date=April 10, 1987|publisher=rogerebert.com|accessdate=July 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[Vincent Canby]], writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'', felt it was "close to inspired when the ambitious Brantley finds himself leading two lives", although he noted that "Hanging over ''The Secret of My Success'' is the long shadow of [[Frank Loesser]]'s classic musical ''[[How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying]]''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Canby|first=Vincent|title=The Secret of My Success|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/43502/The-Secret-of-My-Success/overview|work=The New York Times|date= April 10, 1987 |publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=July 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film holds a 55% "rotten" rating at website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 20 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Secret of My Success-critics rating|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/secret_of_my_success|work=Rotten Tomatoes|publisher=Flixster, Inc|accessdate=July 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Box office===
The film opened on April 10, 1987, and debuted at number one at the box office, taking $7.8&amp;nbsp;million in its opening weekend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Secret of My Success' No. 1 at the Box Office Spot|work= The New York Times|date=April 15, 1987|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/15/movies/secret-of-my-success-no-1-at-the-box-office.html|accessdate=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It stayed at No. 1 for 5 weeks, and was in the top ten films for 2 months.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9767">The '''Training Within Industry''' ('''TWI''') service was created by the [[United States Department of War]], running from 1940 to 1950 within the [[War Manpower Commission]].  The purpose was to provide consulting services to war-related industries whose personnel were being [[Conscription|conscripted]] into the [[United States Army|US Army]] at the same time the War Department was issuing orders for additional [[matériel]].  It was apparent that the shortage of trained and skilled personnel at precisely the time they were needed most would impose a hardship on those industries, and that only improved methods of job training would address the shortfall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/ATO/Admin/WarProgram/charts/WarProgram-20.jpg]&lt;/ref&gt;  By the end of [[World War II]], over 1.6 million workers in over 16,500 plants had received a certification. The program continued post-war in Europe and Asia, where it aided reconstruction.  It is most notable in the business world for inspiring the concept of [[kaizen]] in Japan.

==Overview==

The four basic training programs (10-hour sessions) developed by TWI were developed by experts on loan from [[Private sector|private industry]]. Because of the intensity of the situation, a large number of experimental methods were tried and discarded. This resulted in a distilled, concentrated set of programs. Each program had introductory programs called "Appreciation Sessions" that were used to sell the programs to top management and introduce the programs to middle management of a company. Each program also had 'Train-the-Trainer' programs and handbooks called "Institute Conductor's Manual" for the master trainers.&lt;ref name = dinero-foundations&gt;{{cite book | last = Dinero | first = Donald | title = Training Within Industry: The Foundation of Lean | year = 2005 | location = Portland, OR | publisher = Productivity Press | isbn = 9781563273070 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The TWI Service also developed a number of "Staff Only" training programs to support staff development and to improve the implementation success.

The TWI trainers had to be invited to a factory in order to present their material.  In order to market the service, they developed the Five Needs of the Supervisor: every supervisor needs to have Knowledge of the Work, Knowledge of Responsibility, Skill in Instructing, Skill in Improving Methods, and Skill in Leading.&lt;ref name = dinero-foundations/&gt;  Each program was based on Charles Allen's 4-point method of Preparation, Presentation, Application, and Testing.

The 10-hour Sessions were:

* Job Instruction (JI) - a course that taught trainers (supervisors and experienced workers) to train inexperienced workers faster. The instructors were taught to break down jobs into closely defined steps, show the procedures while explaining the key points and the reasons for the key points, then watch the student attempt under close coaching, and finally to gradually wean the student from the coaching.  The course emphasized the credo, "If the worker hasn't learned, the instructor hasn't taught".&lt;ref name = dinero-foundations/&gt; At the request of enterprises outside of manufacturing, variations to the JI program were developed for hospitals, office and farms.
* Job Methods (JM) - a course that taught workers to objectively evaluate the efficiency of their jobs and to methodically evaluate and suggest improvements. The course also worked with a job breakdown, but students were taught to analyze each step and determine if there were sufficient reason to continue to do it in that way by asking a series of pointed questions. If they determined some step could be done better by eliminating, combining, rearranging, or simplifying, they were to develop and apply the new method by selling it to the "boss" and co-workers, obtaining approval based on safety, quality, quantity, and cost, standardizing the new method, and giving credit.&lt;ref name = dinero-foundations/&gt;
* Job Relations (JR) - a course that taught supervisors to deal with workers effectively and fairly. It emphasized the lesson, "People Must Be Treated As Individuals".&lt;ref name = dinero-foundations/&gt;
* Program Development (PD) - the meta-course that taught those with responsibility for the training function to assist the line organization in solving production problems through training.&lt;ref name = dinero-foundations/&gt;

There was also a short-lived course that taught union personnel (UJR) to work effectively with management.&lt;ref name = dinero-foundations/&gt;

=== Additional programs ===

Internal training programs were; "Management Contact Manual" (1944) - a formal training course on how to sell the TWI programs to management, "How to get Continuing Results from TWI Programs in a Plant" (1944) - this training program was the out-growth of two years of practical experimentation and experience on what it took to have a successful implementation of TWI.

* Job Safety (JS) - While the US TWI Service chose to not develop a JS program, stating that safety was part of every job, Canada led the way with the first variant that was closely modeled on the JI program. This program was offered to England, which declined and developed a JS program that focused on discovery of risk and resolution. Copies of the British programs were circulated in Japan starting about 1948.&lt;ref&gt;(Reference: US National Archive SCAP collection)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Problem Solving (PS) - There are two different programs using similar names. The TWI Foundation released their PS program in 1946 and follows the standard J program format. TWI, Inc. released their program in 1955 and is a much more comprehensive program that revolves around using the JI, JR and JM programs for problem solving.&lt;ref&gt;(Reference: US National Archive SCAP collection; US National Archive TWIF Collection)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Discussion Leading (DL) - This is an early work in developing what is now recognized as facilitation skills. TWIF also produced a variant of this program called Conference Leading.

=== Expansion to other nations ===

There were several groups that had an impact in the expansion of the TWI programs around the world - [[United States Department of State|US State Department]], [[United States Army|US Army]], [[British Ministry of Labour,]] [[International Labour Organization|International Labor Organization]] (ILO) and [[Standard Oil]].&lt;ref&gt;(Reference: US National Archives ; British National Archives; ILO Archives Geneva)&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1944, the British Ministry of Labour sent [[Frank Perkins (British Politician)|Frank Perkins]] to the US to evaluate the TWI programs.&lt;ref&gt;(Reference: British National Archives - Perkins Report - folder LAB 18-139)&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1944, Perkins returned to England to establish a similar program. The British Ministry of Labour actively promoted the TWI programs, listing 65 countries in addition to the US and England where TWI was known to be in use as of 1959.&lt;ref&gt;(Reference: British National Archive - folder LAB 18-724)&lt;/ref&gt; Expansion into Europe was led by Standard Oil, which led the translation efforts of the manuals into native languages. 
Some European TWI activity was done under the [[Marshall Plan]] by "Visiting Experts" (VE), with limited success. It was the later work by the ILO using the Standard Oil translations and re-translation efforts that established the TWI programs in Europe. The ILO TWI training program in [[Bangalore|Bangalore India]] has the distinction of training the first Japanese about 1947.&lt;ref&gt;(Reference: US National Archive SCAP collection - Japan; ILO Archives Geneva)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post war ===

Although the TWI program funding for application of the programs in the USA by the government ended in 1945, the US government did fund the introduction to the war-torn nations of Europe and Asia. Several private groups continued to provide TWI in the US and abroad. Channing Dooley, Walter Dietz, Mike Kane and [[Bill Conover]] (collectively known as "the Four Horsemen") continued the development of the 'J' programs by establishing the TWI Foundation.&lt;ref name = dinero-foundations/&gt; This group was responsible for continuing the spread of TWI throughout Europe and Asia. The Director of one of the district offices established TWI, Inc., and was hired by the US Government to provide TWI training in Japan. It was especially well received in Japan, where TWI formed the basis of the [[kaizen]] culture in industry.  ''Kaizen'', known by such names as ''Quality Circles'' in the West, was successfully harnessed by [[Toyota Motor Corporation]] in conjunction with the [[Lean manufacturing|Lean]] or [[Just In Time (business)|Just In Time]] principles of [[Taiichi Ohno]].  In the Foreword to Dinero's book "Training Within Industry", John Shook relates a story in which a Toyota trainer brought out an old copy of a TWI service manual to prove to him that American workers at [[NUMMI]] could be taught using the "Japanese" methods used at Toyota.  Thus, TWI was the forerunner of what is today regarded as a Japanese creation.&lt;ref name = dinero-foundations/&gt;

An '''unsecured creditor''' is a [[creditor]] other than a [[preferential creditor]] that does not have the benefit of any [[security interest]]s in the assets of the [[debtor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unsecuredcreditor.asp|title=Definition: unsecured creditor|publisher=Investopedia|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the event of the [[bankruptcy]] of the debtor, the unsecured creditors usually obtain a ''[[pari passu]]'' distribution out of the assets of the insolvent company on a liquidation in accordance with the size of their debt after the [[secured creditor]]s have enforced their [[security interest|security]] and the preferential creditors have exhausted their claims.

Although in a [[liquidate|liquidation]] the unsecured creditors will usually realize the smallest proportion of their claims, in some legal systems, unsecured creditors who are also indebted to the insolvent debtor can (and in some jurisdictions, must) [[set-off (law)|set off]] the debts, putting the unsecured creditor with a matured liability to the debtor in a pre-preferential position.
